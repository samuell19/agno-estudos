CHARLIE (VOICEOVER): I have been hurt by others, and I will hurt them. I will make them suffer like I have suffered. NARRATOR: The words of a sadist, one of the most disruptive elements in human society. To have complete mastery over another, to make him a helpless object, to humiliate him, to enslave, to inflict moral insanity on the innocent, that is his objective, his twisted pleasure. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HORN HONKS] -Strange looking place. -What I thought. Fuel pump. -How long you think it'll take you to fix? -Has to be replaced. Take about a half an hour if they have the part. -Hm. -They should have one with all these wrecks around here. This back highway's good for time, but have car trouble and you've got problems. -If it had to happen, I'm glad it happened where it did and when it did. I didn't much relish the idea of being stuck on those mountains. -I'd say we're lucky. Another few miles, we'd have been in desert. -Is it what you thought, Mr. Stiles? -I'm afraid so. -Can we still make the game? -Oh, we got 40 miles to go. 12:01. Game doesn't start 'til 1:30. We can still make it if they have the part. -And if they don't? -It's plain stuck. -If it wasn't Sunday, they could order one from Lancaster. -Where are the people who run this place? Hello? -You see, when the player swats the ball-- -Not swats the ball, Doris. Bats. The player bats the ball. -Yeah. When the player bats the ball and it goes over the fence-- -That's a home run. -I know. But if no one can make him out, why does he have to run around the bases? -Because he has to. That's the rules. He must touch every base. Would you like a Coke? -Oh, thank you. -Somebody can run off with the whole place and the owner would never know it. -Coke, Ed? -Sure. -From the looks of things, nothing 'round here worth taking. -It's a wonder they get any business at all. Everything is so dirty and greasy. -All work isn't white collar work, Miss Page. -I was in the Army. I had my fill of this repairing tanks. Miss Prim and Proper should have known me then. -Doris Page is a sweet girl, Ed, and a good math teacher. Uh, a little on the prudish side, perhaps. -A boy in my phys ed class calls her Miss Ice Buckets. -Mr. Oliver, I think theirs is a, a silly rule. There is no reason why a man should have to run around the bases when they can't get him out. -Isn't that a woman for you? Never seen a baseball game and already she's changing the rules. -You should go to a ball game with my wife. -Well, I still think that's a silly rule. -We're never going to see any baseball today. Where's the guy that runs this place? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hey, what about some service? -Hello? They must be around here some place. Doesn't seem likely they'd go away and leave everything wide open. -Perhaps they're around in back some place. ED: Hey, anybody here? Hello? Hello? If the pump hadn't already been stripped off that Chevy, we might be in business. [MUSIC PLAYING] -We got ourselves a fuel pump if it's any good. -Will that work on our car? -Take a few adjustments, but should get us to LA. I'll borrow a few wrenches, and we'll soon be out of here. -Our Mr. Stiles has many talents. -A fine young man. Be a lucky woman that hooks him. -Oh, Mr. Oliver, I do believe you're playing Cupid again. -You're only young once, Miss Page. -Why, Mr. Oliver, you sound like an old man. -Well, 52 yesterday. -I'd say you'd had a fine and full life. A nice home, a lovely wife, two handsome children. -Carl Junior graduates from West Point in two weeks. Wife and I are going back for the graduation. -This guy really takes care of his tools. -Hm. Wonder where these people are. -I'll look around and see if I can find somebody. -I don't want to shock you, Miss Page, but I'd rather not get my shirt dirty. -Oh really, Mr. Stiles, I'm not that stuffy. -I don't know. We've taught the same school for over a year and it's still Miss Page and Mr. Stiles. I do think Ed and Doris would sound a lot better. -From now on it shall be Ed and Doris. -Just a snake skin. They shed this time of year. -I can't stand snakes. -Most people can't. Part of the country's loaded with them, big ones. I hear they get to be as much as nine feet long. -Well, I was certainly wrong, wasn't I? -Hello? Hello? Anybody here? Hello? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hello? [MUSIC PLAYING] [CLANK] [KNOCKING] -Doris? Ed? Hello? Hello? [MUSIC PLAYING] -You'd never know he's the same history teacher from old Lancaster High. He really cuts loose. Today he'll really be in this glory with his red flag. -I know. Edna told me last night that he hasn't seen them play since they left Cincinnati. She said ever since he got the tickets he's been-- -There's something going on here that just isn't right. Settings were four at the kitchen table, two plates eaten from and two plates untouched, pie still warm. Except for a cat there's not a sign of life. The sooner we get out of here, the better off I'll feel. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Just keep working, mister, because you're going to fix your car just like you intended. -Young man, you have no right to take our-- -Shut up. -What if I don't fix it? -You'll fix it all right, mister. You better not take too long, either. -Supposing I get it fixed, what happens then? -Me and my girl go away and won't bother you. (SCOLDING) Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. -How do we know you'll keep your word? -Looks like you're just going to have take it, ain'tcha, mister? [GIGGLES] -Bang! [GIGGLES] [MUSIC PLAYING] -You, give me your wallet. -There's not much, but you're welcome to it. Well, we're only schoolteachers, young man. -You hear that, Judy? "We're only schoolteachers." We don't like schoolteachers, do we, Judy? Teachers think they're so much smarter than everybody else. -You have our money. Isn't that enough? What else do you want? CHARLIE: Just keep working, mister. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Teachers used to call Judy dumb, make fun of her, send her home from school crying. DORIS: (SCREAMING) No! Stop it! -You're a pretty good size, boy. I wonder how tough you'd be without that gun. CHARLIE: Ooh, you're one of them real big talkers, ain't you, mister? All right, big talker, hand over your wallet. Come on. Pick it up. -You pick it up. -You're a real big man in front of your lady friend. But I'm going to show her just how big you really are. -Put down that gun and I'll show you how big you are. -I'm giving you three seconds, mister, to do what I say. I'm saying you pick up that wallet. One, two. -Please, do as he says. -(GIGGLING) Uh, you put on the fender. Or do you want the gun, huh? You want the gun? On the fender. Big man, huh? I guess you got showed how big you really was. Start working. [MUSIC PLAYING] -May I get some water? This poor man has been blinded by his own blood. Don't you even have the decency to let me care for this man? What kind of a person are you? Do you enjoy hurting others, seeing them in pain? How can you be so inhuman? [MUSIC PLAYING] -(SCOLDING) Eh, uh, uh uh, uh. [GIGGLES] [JUDY GIGGLING] -How is he? -His head is all right, but I know it must hurt. The gash in his cheek isn't too, too bad, but the cut over his eye, it won't stop bleeding. I'm afraid he might bleed to death. -Now, now, Doris, it can't be that bad. -Where do you think you're going? -This man needs help, and he's going to get it if you want this car fixed. He's going to be all right, Doris. You're lucky, Carl. A little more to the right you wouldn't be here. If we can get you some water and in the shade we can stop the bleeding. What about letting this man get in the shade? -How can you be so cruel? -You get back in that car, and he won't be needing nothing. -Oh, by all means, enjoy your lovemaking. Well, the least you can do is allow a suffering man a little water. Carrying on like that when-- you're no more than an animal! You get your dirty hands off me. -You leave her alone if you want the car fixed. -And he won't fix it unless you let us get some water. -There's a pump by the house. -You keep working on that car, mister. And you, go ahead. Shoot if they move, Judy. If I hear a shot, your girlfriend is dead. Don't get no ideas. Judy don't know how to use a gun. -I wonder, I wonder why he changed his mind. Ed, I don't like this. -I know something else you won't like, Carl. Remember reading last week about those brutal killings in Arizona? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Will you please let me by? Why are you putting us through this torture? You have our money and you're taking our car. Isn't that enough? -You keep your dirty hands off me. You think your so much better than me. Your kind all think that way. You called me inhuman. -All right. I apologize. I shouldn't have said that. Now, will you let me go? -Called me an animal. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said those things. Now, can I go? -You're sorry, but you still think it. You think I'm dirt. You think Judy's dirt. You'll always think it 'til you don't think no more. Your kind means nothing, you hear? Nothing. Why don't you scream? Maybe the big talker will come and help you. Maybe Miss Goodie Good Good still thinks she's so much better than me. How does it feel to be touched by dirt, huh? Goodie Good Good don't like it. Taste it. Taste it! Eat the dirt. Taste it. Miss Goodie Good don't think she's so much now, does she? She don't mind being touched by dirt. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Get moving. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GIGGLING] -What did he do to you, child? -It's all right, Mr. Oliver. It's all right. [JUDY GIGGLING] -Get back to work. -You want that car fixed, you can do it yourself. -Starting to be the big man again, huh? -You're the big man, Tibbs. That's the name, isn't it? Charlie Tibbs? The big man who killed seven people. Made them get on their knees and shot them in the head. The paper calls you a thrill killer. Must be a real thrill to wipe out a family of five. How many thrills have you had since you left Arizona? What about the people here? Did you kill them too? -How long do you think you could keep getting away with this, son? The law's bound to catch up with you sooner or later. -And the law has ways of handling murderers. -Please don't antagonize him any more. -What's going to happen to you? -Anybody opens their mouth again, I'll blow their brains out. Listen, big man, you get back to fixing that car, or you're going to be a big dead man fast. All of a sudden everybody's becoming the big talker, getting kind of brave. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Nobody wants to talk no more, Judy. -(WHISPERING) I'm going to get my goodie bag. -Judy, bring me a soda. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Just a little target practice. (WHISPERING) I'm going to shake the bottle over [INAUDIBLE] head. -Mr. Oliver, they're going to do something terrible, I just know it. [JUDY GIGGLING] -You, get up. Over there. -What are you going to do? -Shut up. Move! That's far enough. Down on your knees. On your knees! Seeing as how you like to talk, go ahead and talk. Talk all you want. As soon as I finish this, you going to be through talking. School be out for you, teacher. You better start talking, mister. Your time's running out. -You can't shoot me like this for no reason, for nothing. Surely blowing my head off can't give you a thrill. Is it money you need? I have close to $2,300 in the bank. Tomorrow you can call my wife. She'll give it to you, all of it. You and your girlfriend can have a lot of fun on $2,300. -He sure is talking a lot different than he did a while ago, ain't he, Judy? -You have a father, don't you? Would you want someone doing this to him? Think of your own father in my place, or yours. CHARLIE: Save your breath on her, mister. I'm the only thing in the world she has. Her old man's dead, and her old lady's a drunk. -Young lady, can't you realize this is wrong? You love him, don't you? You know what it is to be around someone you love and who loves you? I have loved ones too, a daughter a little older than you, a son about his age. Please, I beg of you, talk to your boyfriend. Tell him this is wrong. Tell him, please. My god, child, haven't you any feelings at all? Can't you understand? -Look at him squirm, Judy. They're all alike, ain't they? Yellow when they go. -You just can't wipe out a man's life like this, not like this. -We just can't stand here and watch. -Ed, you can't let him do this. Maybe he'll listen to you. Talk to him. Ed, talk to him. --[INAUDIBLE] Make somebody do something. Tell him you won't fix the car. Don't let him do it. ED: You want the car fixed? -Maybe the big man wants to take your place. He says one more word, he will. What about it, big man. You feel like talking? Maybe Miss Good Good wants to take his place. I guess nobody wants to take your place, mister. [MUSIC PLAYING] -School's out, teacher. -No. No, please. Don't. Ed, Miss Page. -(SCREAMING) You monster, you monster! -Doris, Doris. -Go ahead, do it. -Shut up. -Shut up yourself. -Doris, get control of yourself. -And you, you coward. -Doris! -Don't touch me. -Doris, you're going to get us both shot. -I don't care. I don't care. Why don't you go ahead and shoot? Go on, shoot. Go on, go on, shoot, shoot. I don't care. -In another couple of minutes, I'll have the pump out. -Shut up. -It won't take very long to put it in the other car. -I said shut up. -Look, you're going to need that car now, and I'm the only one that can fix it. -I ain't waiting too long. Judy, go get me a soda, and that pie too. -Poor Edna. How will anybody be able to tell? His son's graduation. -Doris, believe me. I feel as badly as you. He's dead. Nothing can bring him back. We're alive. We've got to think of ourselves now. Do you think I wanted to stand there and watch him die? What could I do? What could anyone have done? You can't reason with that kid. He wants blood, Doris, and nobody's going to talk him out of it. Don't you understand what we're dealing with? He's a psycho, Doris. Or should I have taken his place? Would that have made you feel better? What would you be saying to Carl if it was me lying over there? The pump's out. -All right. Put it in the other car. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ed, I'm sorry. -Forget it. -I feel so ashamed for acting the way I did. There was nothing we could do. Why don't we just run? The highway is only a few yards from here. -He'd cut us down before we got five feet. -I'll die running before I get on my knees. I can still see him drinking with us. [LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Maybe a car will come by and stop. -Sure, Doris. Maybe a car will pull in. -Supposing a car does pull in, they won't know. He'll kill them and us too. The police, maybe the police will pass by. They do patrol this highway. They will, Ed. They will. -Sure they will. -They'll find a way to make them stop then. -Doris, miracles do happen, but you can't count on them. -I'm sorry. -Now listen. I'm going to try to find out how many more shots he has left or if he has reloaded or not. -But how will we find out? -Four shots we know of, that leaves four. He probably shot the people here too. There must have been two. Remember what Carl told us about the settings in the kitchen. -Yes. Two plates eaten from and two plates untouched. -Tibbs must have surprised them while they were eating. They were to frightened to eat while those two were stuffing themselves. If he shot them, that leaves two shots. He certainly didn't walk here from Arizona. Maybe he shot someone else. And if he hasn't reloaded-- -Go ahead and talk, mister. You talk all you want. You thinking somebody's going to save you. -Why should I fix the car if you're going to kill us anyhow? -You'll fix it because that lets you live a little longer, like back there. I know that you were stalling. If you don't want to fix the car, you die right now. -You want this car, Tibbs. Who are you fooling? Oh, you can kill us, but you'd be stranded. -That's a road, ain't it? Where there's a road, there's cars. Somebody will pick us up. They always have. -Is that how you got here from Arizona? CHARLIE: A sailor picked us up. -How far did he take you? -Better than real love, huh, Judy? -Suppose you shot him too. -Naw. I just cut his throat. -Why haven't you still got his car? -Ran out of gas last night. You're sure asking a lot of questions, mister. But you go ahead and ask all you want. -How did you get here? -A farmer picked us up. His old crate broke down up the road a piece. Too bad. I was beginning to like that old codger. -Shoot him too? -He sure prayed when he went, Judy, remember? He reached for the sky and talked to the Lordy Lord. -Then you shot him. -Yeah. Right between the eyes. -What about the two people you shot here? Did they pray too? -You must think I'm dumb, mister, don't know nothing. You're counting bullets. Count all you want. I can count too. You know I only fired seven shots, only got one bullet left unless I reloaded. How many bullets do I have left? Come on, come on. You the big man. Come on. The one bullet's gone. Come on, maybe the gun's empty. Come on, mister. I'm giving you a chance. Come on, big man. Come on, mister. Come get the gun. What's the matter, you afraid? You had a chance, mister. You should have taken it. You ain't gonna get no more. See how yellow they are, Judy? Afraid of an empty gun. Big man. Big talker. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Push her [INAUDIBLE] -Ed, they're getting ready to do something. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You. -No. [ENGINE SOUNDS] -The police. they're coming, Mr. Stiles. I told you they would. They will stop. They will. They will. They're coming after him. They're coming after you. You hear me? You, you, you're not going to kill anymore! -Doris. -Get in back. Get in back or I'll kill you right now. Do as I say! Go! Over there. Lie down. Lie down! [MUSIC PLAYING] -(WHISPERING) They're stopping. -Get up. Get to the car. Hurry up. -It must be the police. -You get in the trunk. Get in there or I'll blow your brains out! One noise and your lady friend dies. Keep her out of sight. She makes one noise, you slit her throat. [ENGINES TURN OFF] [SQUEAKING] -Hi. -Hello, son. Sure a scorcher. -Sure is. -Don't recall having seen you around here before, son. -Friend of the family. -Just talked to Milt's son in town about an hour ago. Funny, being the talker he is, didn't mention anything about visitors. -Uh, he just left before I got in. -Lancaster, huh? CHARLIE: Yeah. Been working on the car. Fuel pump trouble. -Mine went out only last week. You know, Jim, it cost over $30 to get it fixed. -Boy, what a crook that guy was. -Look, somebody lost a 45 clip. -Where is Milt? -Out back someplace. -Boy, he can get more parts of a car than the factory put in it. -Yeah, he sure can. -Help! Help! Help! [GUNSHOT] -Help! Help! Help. -Get out. I told you to keep quiet. Should have done what I told you. Get moving. -Oh! [MUSIC PLAYING] CHARLIE: I told you nobody could help you. -You're going to have every officer in California looking for you. -They don't scare me. Nobody scares me. I'm going to give you a choice, big man. You die now, or you fix that car. I'll give you 15 minutes to fix it. -Why should I fix it? You'll only kill us when I get done. -I'm giving you 15 more minutes of life, mister. If you don't want it, I'll blow your head off right now. Hers too. It's 1 o'clock. You got until 1:15. You start working. [CHUCKLES] [HORN HONKING] -Who would ever believe something like this? -How could he shoot two officers? There were two of them. Two of them. CHARLIE: Judy, give me that gun. -15 minutes. What are we going to do? DISPATCHER (ON RADIO): All units, all units, be on the alert for two Arizona murder suspects believed to be in California, possibly driving a green 1958 Ford sedan, license number Mary Nora 4-6-9-8-3. Suspects hitched ride with the driver of this car, a sailor en route to San Diego. The sailor was found murdered two miles east of Needles approximately 10:30 this date. Tibbs, Charles A, male Caucasian, age 20. Light brown hair, blue eyes. Height 6'1", Weight approximately 180 pounds. Fair complexion. Wearing Levi jacket pants when last seen. This suspect is armed and to be considered extremely dangerous. In company with suspect number one is Bradshaw, Judy, female Caucasian, age 18. Black hair, blue eyes. Height approximately 5'4", weight approximately 100 pounds. Dark complexion. Wearing a yellow flowered dress when last seen. -If only that radio call had come two minutes earlier. -We've got to do something. -Looks like we'll have to run for it. [HORN HONKS] [LAUGHTER] -Move closer. Get in front of me. I got an idea. It may not work, but at least it's a chance. It's obvious he doesn't know much about cars. Now look, when I get the pump in, I'll ask you to get in the car and start it. Leave it in neutral. I'll race the motor from here. When I give you the first signal-- uh, I'll scratch my shoulder. When I do, you shift into drive and push down on the brake. Got that? -Yes. -When I give you the second signal-- I'll wink-- hold on tight because I'll be pulling the gas pedal to the floorboard. I'm going to try to lure him in front of the car. [GIGGLING] -Oh, Ed. -It's just a chance. We might not hit him, but if we can at least startle him, it may give me the few seconds I need. Let's just pray this doesn't kick out on us. -What if it does? -Run for it. -What if he won't let me get in the car? -It's a chance we'll just have to take. [CAT MEOWING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -You got 11 minutes. -Doris. Damn it. I can't fix the car with you starting it. [HORN HONKS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [GIGGLING] SPORTCASTER (ON RADIO): This is Dick Woods bringing you music from Dodger Stadium as we do every Sunday preceding the ball game. Talking about baseball, those red hot Cincinnati Reds are in town, riding a nine-game winning streak. It's going to be Bob Purkey going for the Reds and Sandy Koufax for the Dodgers. It should be quite a pitchers' battle. There's still plenty of good seats to be had, so if you're not doing anything, come out to Dodger Stadium and see exciting National League baseball. It's a beautiful day for a ball game. Time is 1:10, still time to come on down. And now stay tuned for Dodger warm-ups. [MUSIC PLAYING] -If we could just get them away from the car long enough to-- -Music. All those people laughing and yelling, so happy. Oh Ed, I don't want to die. I don't want to die. -(WHISPERING) You're not going to die, Doris. [GIGGLING] -Four minutes. -Doris, get in the car and start it so I can see if the pump holds pressure. Doris, get the car and start it. -Just a minute. -You want the car to run. I want to live those extra few minutes. Now I have to check the pump for pressure. -All right. But it better run good. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Start it up. -You ain't got much more time. Two minutes. How does it feel when you're about to die? -Try it now. -I think you're yellow belly. Yeah. One of them squirmers. [ENGINE REVVING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [ENGINE REVS] [MUSIC PLAYING] CHARLIE: Get out. I said get out! Move. You must think I'm stupid. You trying something? -[INAUDIBLE] CHARLIE: You did something. -I did nothing. -It was running pretty good a few seconds ago. You must have did something. -Look, this pump has been in a wrecked car for who knows how long. Now sometimes they get clogged and don't hold a pressure. I should take it out and clean it. -You ain't got time for that. -It's not holding pressure. It needs to be cleaned. -You're out of time, ain'tcha? -It won't take very long. -You ain't taking nothing out! You think you're fooling me, don't you? Think I don't know nothing about cars, don't you? That thing right there, that's a carburetor. The car can't run unless there's gas in it. All you gotta do is prime it. Now, I seen that done, so you prime it. Well, go on. There's a gas pump over there. -Doris, get in the car and start it when I tell you to. -Nobody gets in that car but me. -Well, if I'm going prime it, somebody has to pump the gas pedal. -Just never you mind. You just put that gas in that carburetor. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOT] -Charlie! -Oh my god, Judy! [MUSIC PLAYING] CHARLIE: Judy, no. Judy. [SOBBING] -Judy, Judy, Judy.
