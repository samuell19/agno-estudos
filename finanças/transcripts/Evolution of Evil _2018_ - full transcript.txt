(somber atmospheric music) - [Woman] We just wanted to get away from it all. We just wanted to get away from all the people. We just wanted to get away from everything. (music intensifies) (light clicks) Ah, that's a terrifying sign. - It's a creepy clown man. - Stop it. (laughs) I think they don't want business here. (laughs) - That's the whole point. - Yeah. - It's brilliant marketing. - Hey, how's it going? - [Man] Oh my God. - God. It's so nice out. - You want anything? - Yeah, I think I'm gonna get some beef jerky, but I'll be in in a second, I just wanna hang out for a minute. - Okay. (crow screeches) - Yeah! - Woo! - Hey, do you wanna get the normal kind, or do you wanna try some of this local stuff? - Oh, local of course, local's always better. - I got you some Preston Pale Ale. - Sweet. - Is that everything? - Yeah, that'll do it. - That'll be $15. - Actually sorry, I have a question. Is there somewhere up the road that's a little bit more secluded that we could camp for a few days, do you know? - I'm sorry, we only take cash. - Are you serious? You guys don't take cards? Oh, that's cute. - Well, if you keep driving up Ballard there, it'll eventually take you up and over the mountain. I suppose you could find somewhere along the way, probably. No one goes much further these days, since they put in the interstate. Thank you. People really come up here for the lake. - Okay, we'll check that out, thank you. - You're welcome. - Here you go. - Oh, thanks. - Bye, have a good day. - Thank you, you too. - Hi. (car bleeps) - So, this seems to be the spot. Do you wanna go check out the lake and-- - No, I don't want to. We always do that. I wanna get away from people. Like, I don't wanna just have to camp right next to these fucking douche bags. - But they're just trying to have a nice time. - You're so nice. I get it, but like, I feel like they don't even appreciate that they're out in nature. I mean, this is untouched wilderness and they're ruining it. - You're right. (woman chuckles) - Good answer. - But their version of getting away is different than our version, but ultimately they're just trying to do the same thing. - Are you serious? - Besides! Isn't it better that they stay here? - Why? - It gives us an opportunity to be private in the big bad woods. - I guess. Did you notice they were buying PBR? - I did. - So gross. - The youth these days. It's upsetting. - I can't believe they put that shit in their body. Mm, this is really good. - [Man] Will you please turn on some music? - [Woman] Oh, sure, you're gonna let me deej? - DJ Lori in the house. - Cool. Oh, we haven't listened to this in a while. I love this CD, I forgot about it. ♪ Circles keep bearing down ♪ ♪ Hard not to notice the sin ♪ ♪ Circles keep circling round ♪ ♪ Wind up all over again ♪ ♪ Wound round all over again ♪ ♪ People keep bringing me down ♪ ♪ Hard not to feel it's a sin ♪ ♪ Circles keep circling round ♪ ♪ Eye of the storm lies within ♪ ♪ Wound round all over again ♪ ♪ Girl, I miss you so ♪ ♪ Circle nowhere in sight ♪ ♪ Circles keep circling round ♪ ♪ Cranking my mind from inside ♪ ♪ Wound round all over again ♪ ♪ Circle, sing it with me ♪ ♪ Circle ♪ - Shh, let them sing.

Up this trail, there's like a small river or a stream, that we could find a place to camp up there. - I bet they took better care of this trail before the fucking Bush administration. - Yeah, right? - You know, maybe that works in our favor, though. It'll discourage people from coming up here. - Yeah, will you lock it? - Yeah. (car bleeps) (dark atmospheric music) (fire crackles) This is it. This is how man was supposed to live. Just... Surviving in the wilderness. All he needs is a fire, a knife, and his wits. (Lori chuckles) - Also, bratwurst. Do we have any more? - Fuckin' bratwurst, yeah. They are so good. - Oh, sweet, thank you. Pulling it off the ground. - There you go. What kind do you want, do you want chicken and basil, or red pepper? - Oh, red pepper. - Lori, something spicy before bed? You'll have nightmares. - You know how I love spicy things before bed. - Well, then Lori gets something spicy. - Don't wag your wiener at me. (man laughs) You got that? You need some help? (man giggles) Um, woops, I killed it. - Oh-oh. - Sorry. (distant gun fires) (gasps) Did you hear that? - Probably just teenagers shootin' beer cans. - All the way out here? - [Man] Unfortunately, we're probably not the only people who come out here. - Are you sure? It's probably those fucking kids from the store earlier. I thought that they had guns on them. They're probably tracking you. 'Cause they're douche bag trackers. - Aww, that's beautiful. - And you're a douche bag. No, you're not. - Well, maybe they got all horned and tuned up from drinking PBR and drivin' their trucks around. Came out here for a hot little piece of ass. - Well, they came to the right place for a hot little piece of ass. Yours. (man laughs) - Thank you! - You're welcome. I could tell they liked you. - I work out. (both laugh) - Oh. Honey, you don't work out. - No. - I'm sorry, I can't keep it lit. - [Man] Here, I got it. - I've wasted like $40 worth of weed already. - Yeah, you did. - I hate my book. I already read it like 12 times when I was 19. By other authors. - [Man] You should play on your phone. - I hate playing on my phone and I can't find it. Stop reminding me of that. - My phone died when we got out here. - Oh, that's convenient. How have you even, have you been okay? - I'm surviving. - You are. All you need is your knife. - True. - Yeah. - I guess we're just gonna have to have an old-fashioned conversation. - Oh, awkward. You cold? - A little bit. - Oh, I can warm you up. I don't have anything to talk to you about. Is it good to throw dirt on the fire? - If you wanna put it out. (Lori laughs) First fire, first time? - Did you just say "tell me about you?" - Tell me about you. (laughs) - [Lori] Oh god, we could play Balderdash. - [Man] Balderdash. - [Lori] Remember when we played that when we were getting STD tests? - Yes, yeah. You were really good. (laughs) - [Lori] Just leave me alone. You seriously think those gunshots were, you're not worried at all? - No. - [Lori] You didn't even jump, just like, "yep, gunshots." - [Man] Ah, you know, I'm a little high. (laughs) (fire crackles and pops) (distant gun fires) (tense atmospheric music) (muffled footsteps) (heavy breaths) (man grunts) - Come on. - Fuck! What the fuck, who are you? Lori, Lori! (muffled groans) (muffled groans) (muffled groans) (muffled sobs) (muffled groans) (music intensifies) (dark atmospheric music) (Lori pants softly) (distant gun fires) (eerie string music) (Lori pants) (Lori groans) (Lori pants) - [Lori] Oh, god!

He always told you... Never let the food get away. When you get hungry, what are you gonna eat? What are you gonna eat? What are you gonna eat? Momma was good to you. She was real good to you. I'm good to you. Your brother is good to you. I'll get you all clean. We'll get you down there, you get that fire goin' down, down the smoke room, and we'll get that meat goin'. (younger brother pants) (tense atmospheric tones) Make sure that fire stays lit. You don't do good in a cold. Be gone for a few, just goin' into town to drop this jerky. You make sure that smoker's ready to go, for when I be gettin' back.

Oh, Jesus Christ, you're a life saver. I can't even begin to tell you how badly I needed you to stop. I'm Lori. - A man's gotta eat. - Right. Look, man, I'm really hurt, do you-- - [Older Brother] If you wanna live, you gotta eat. Ain't no time to be a sissy boy. - Yeah. Can you just take me to a town or like, a phone nearby or something? - Yep. - Okay, thank you so much. That's great. Fucking kids, I was out camping and I got shot by some stupid kid's stray bullet. I have no fucking clue where I am. I don't know where my husband is. I haven't seen anyone all day long. You're the first person that I've seen. (dark atmospheric music) (sighs) Oh, god. - [Husband] Lori! (light buzzes) (light buzzes) (heavy breaths) (dark atmospheric music) (birds squawk) - (groans) God. (door slams) It's right here? Do you have a phone? Do you have a phone? I need to make a phone call. Do you have a fucking phone? Is it over here? I don't see a fucking phone. Oh, god. - Frank, Frank. Now, boy, boy, settle down. Don't wanna frighten her. Set your bowl, set her down, set her down. That a boy. - [Lori] I don't know what the fuck you guys are doing. I just need to make a phone call. - [Older Brother] Frank, come on over this way. - Lori! - Over here, calm down, Frank. We don't want no fear runnin' through our meat and bones. Come over here, come here, boy, you hear? - Chris, you're in here? (shouting over each other) (Frank shouts) (Lori yelps) - Here, no! Get over here! Get... (grunts) It's alright. She'll be back. She's wounded. I know she'll be back for her mate. (somber atmospheric music) (muffled groans) (Lori sobs) (Lori groans) (Chris moans) (Chris groans) (Lori pants) (Chris groans) (Lori moans) - [Lori] Fuck. Oh, god. (groans) (pants) Oh, my god.

It's alright, it's okay, you'll be okay. It's okay, it's okay, I'm right here, I've got you. I've got you, I'm right here, I've got you. (Chris sobs) I'm here now, it's alright. It's okay. It's okay, it's alright. (thud) (dark atmospheric music) (background clacks and clinks) - You a feisty one. I'm gonna like taking care of you. (chuckles) You ain't been nothin' but trouble since you walked through the door. I knew it was too good to be true for you to be walkin' into the dinner table like that. (steel scrapes) My daddy always said, "you gotta eat what you kill." That's how man was supposed to live. Just surviving out in the wilderness. All you need is a fire and a knife. I reckon he knew a lot. My brother Arvis is gonna be real happy with me. See what good I done. I got all this meat a-smokin' for his next batch. My brother's gonna be real happy with me. (chuckles) "Idle hands are the devil's workshop," Arvis says. - What the fuck is wrong with you? Why are you doing this? The fuck is the matter with you? What the fuck is the matter with you? You and your brother are fucking psychos! What kind of man are you? Your brother's a fucking backwoods idiot. Why are you doing this to us? What kind of man does this shit? What the fuck? You guys are like inbred fucking morons! (Frank moans) Fuck you, what the fuck is wrong with you? You fucking weirdo! I fucking hate you! I hope you fucking die! (Frank moans) Fuck you, take us down from here! What the fuck's wrong with you, let us go! (flesh squelches) (tense atmospheric music) (blood drips) Oh, god. (groans) (dark atmospheric music) (blood drips) (door creaks) (wind blows) (truck approaches) (door creaks) (door creaks) (blood drips) (chain clinks) (pants) (pants) (sighs) (sobs) (somber atmospheric music) (pants) (muffled pants) (muffled pants) (muffled background chatter) (sobs) We just wanted to get away. To be alone. We just wanted... To be removed from it all. (sobs) - [Female Camper] (screams) Oh, my god!
