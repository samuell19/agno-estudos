Gonna work? Oh, hi! Absolutely. Have you even used this? I'm more of a takeout girl, Goldy. Well, this is restaurant quality. So said the man who bought it for me. That sounds like my ex-husband, now your boyfriend. My extremely doting boyfriend. You say that like it's a bad thing. It's a fine line between doting and smothering. Happy birthday! Thanks, Marla! Roses? Oh, Richard! For my rose. Happy birthday, cuz. Thanks, cuz. Goldy, Marla, what can I do to help? You can make yourself a drink and enjoy. Thank you. Of course. Those do not look like regular shish kebabs. Well, as you know, I am far from regular. You came. Hm. I'm proud of you. Hi, Tom. Marla. How's Kenny Zox? Smitten. I'm sure. Is it mutual? Well, we'll see. Do you know the diameter of your pecs? Excuse me? Because Kenny knows his. He invited me to work out with him. Oh, and what did you say to that offer? I told him I needed to refill my platter and that I would call him later. Good call. Mhm, and I'm surprised you had time for the party. What does that mean? Oh, I mean, Goldy was just saying that- Marla. That I need to pass some more shish kebabs. It's great to see you, Tom. Yeah. Do you wanna tell me what that was all about, or do I have to play detective? Is it playing detective if you have that badge? You're dodging my question. Marla thinks that I need to have a more active social life, and she strongly believes that you should be a part of it, so I told her that I spoke with you and that you said you were very, very busy. So you lied. Yes, I did. Yeah. What's in the box? Do you wanna play detective? Always. Scented candle. Ah, it's too easy! Come on! Where's the hostess? Ah, over there. Who's the close talker? That is Hal Bartholomew, Susie's ex. Doesn't look ex to me. That's Hal just being Hal and Susie is just being friendly, but he's definitely with Richard. Detective. Hey, how are you doing? - Doctor. This is Dennis Lockwood. Tom Shultz. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Susie's neighbor. Oh, and mine. We have offices right beside each other at the hospital. Oh, you're a doctor too? A surgeon. That's correct. Oh, and Dennis provided the wine tonight, all the way from Italy. Tom, you came! I wouldn't miss it. Susie, no hug for me? Thank you for bringing the wine, Dennis. It's the neighborly thing to do. Hey, Tom, I'll get you a glass? I'm okay. Thank you. Okay. Susie, you could have at least made an effort. I invited him, didn't I? Stephanie! I see those two are still fighting. Those two are like oil and water. Susie likes to entertain, as you can see, and sometimes their parties go a little late, and Dennis has complained. What, did he call the police? No, worse. He complained to the neighborhood association. That's worse? To live in this development, you have to abide by a lot of rules, and one of 'em is that three complaints and that triggers a hearing. Now, if the hearing board finds against you, you can be compelled to sell. How many complaints does Susie have? Two, which is why I asked her to play nice and invite the man. Ah, excuse me, guys. Nice to see you, Tom. You too. Still glad you came? At least the food's good. Hey, come on in! Your ex-wife is here. What? What is she doing here? I don't know. You're asking me? I mean, she's supposed to be in San Francisco. I know. Oh, she saw us. She's coming over right now. - Oh, she's coming. - Yeah, she's coming over. Tommy, oh! Jess. Oh! Goldy Berry! Hi, Jessamyn. Susie told me you were catering. So cute. I don't think we've seen each other since high school graduation. And I had no idea that you had been married and divorced. Well, until I met your ex-husband. Oh, well, it was a bit of a whirlwind, wasn't it, Tommy? Mm, a whirlwind. So, how do you two know each other? It's a funny story, actually, so- What are you doing here? Well, Susie and I were close in high school. I had business in Denver and thought I'd just pop over. Jess, you came! Of course I came! Oh, this looks delicious. It is. Goldy is a genius. Jessamyn. Hey. - Hal! Did you two patch things up? Still divorced, Jess. But I'm happy to be here to celebrate this wonderful woman. Aren't we all? Jess, this is too much! It's your favorite, right? Yes, and that's how I know it costs $900. Oh, you're worth it, but save it for later. I'll have whatever's already out there. Are you kidding me? I'm at her birthday party right now. She didn't say anything to me. Does she think she can back out? We have a contract. I didn't threaten her. Maybe I should. I'm kidding. I wouldn't hurt her. At least not in front of people. Hey, is Susie and Kenny in business together? Yeah, he's building those condos over on Hyperion, and Susie's the main investor. Why? Because I just overheard him in the phone, because he was screaming. I think she's trying to back out, and he said something about not hurting her in front of people. He said that? Yeah. Maybe it was a joke. Not a funny one. Hi! How much have you had to drink? Is it true? You're gonna believe Dennis? He's trying to force me to sell my house! Oh, so you're not gonna answer my question? As you well know, Hal and I have history. I'm not asking about your history! I'm asking why he was here and left at two in the morning! Oh, there you are. Here I am. What's up? I was wondering if you were ready for the cake. Yes, of course. - Okay. - Let's- Susie, we have to talk. Can we pick this up later? What is going on? She's cheating on me. What? With her pathetic ex-husband. How do you even know that? Does it really matter, Goldy? I gotta go. Richard, come on. Richard! Richard, you can't! I'm sorry. What's going on? I don't know. Can you just come with me? I think I might need you. Yeah. Richard, come on. Did you know that I was gonna give her this tonight? Oh, Richard. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. For what, Dennis? You're not the one who had the affair. You don't know that that's it. What? What do you mean? I didn't mean to cause any trouble. Forget it. I gotta go. Come on. Let's go to my house. I'll make you a big cup of coffee. Come on. Come on. Go have some coffee. I'll call you later, okay? Come on. What happened? I think Dennis saw Hal leave the house at 2:00 a.m. You think he lodged complaint number three? Maybe, but Richard thinks- That Hal and Susie are having an affair, obviously. Well, what do you think? I don't know. You know, I'll talk to her later. All I know is I have to go back inside, put a smile on my face, and cut some cake. The dishwasher is going. Thanks, Marla. What else can I do for you? Strangle Jessamyn? Seriously, that laugh of hers takes me back to high school and not in a good way. Look at her being all flirty with the guy she divorced. I mean, do you think she's here to patch things up with him? Marla! What? I'm trying to clean the grill. It's really clean, Goldy. Okay, we're off. - Aw. - Oh, no. Yeah, but so great to see you both again, and to see how well your little business is going, Goldy. Great party, guys. Thank you. Thanks. I told you like a month ago to ask him out. As you know, I have been busy with my little business. Thank you both so much. People loved it. Oh. Richard notwithstanding. I hope you don't mind me asking. What Richard believes, is it true? What's true is that Dennis is trying to force me to sell my house. But was Hal here until two o'clock in the morning? In fact, he was, and we were inside, not causing any noise, so I don't know what Dennis is complaining about. Look, I hate to ask, but what was he doing here that late? I'm not having an affair, I promise you that, and I'll explain it to Richard as soon as he calms down. Okay. Where's the birthday girl? Look who finally showed up. I was working, or did you forget that you hired me? We hired her? Not the agency. Just me. How've you been, Chester? Good, Fran, but I'm on my way home. Happy birthday, cuz. Take care, Chester. Goldy, Marla, do you know Fran Markesian? Hi. The private eye. Have we met? No, I've just seen your online ads. Good to know someone notices those. Here's my card in case you ever need anything. Thanks. Can we talk in private? Sure. Ladies, take off. I can finish the cleanup myself, and here. No, Richard's paying. Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen. Honestly, I feel better about it this way. Okay. Happy birthday. Thank you. Nice to meet you, Fran. Yeah, you too, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Oh, hi. Hi. What's going on? Did you get my text? I guess you didn't see it. No. My phone's charging. Are you busy? Tom! - Olive. - Hey. How are you? I'm good. Good. Good to see you. Oh, smells great. I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just leftovers. Well, your mom's leftovers are better than most people's five-star meals. Oh, that's sweet. Do you want some? Hm? Yeah, that would be great. Okay. Hey, so how's softball going? I hear you got a tournament coming up in Salt Lake. Yeah. How did you know that? Are you asking me to reveal my confidential informant? Is that what she's doing? Really? Richard. You know, I'd love to come watch you play sometime. We're practicing tomorrow. You guys could come together. Um, sure. Sure. I think I'm gonna take my food upstairs. Are you sure? Yeah. Thanks, Mom. Okay. Bye. Mm, this really is better the second time around. So what's going on? I just, you know. I just came to check on Richard. I haven't spoken to him since he had coffee with Dennis. Hm. Also, me leaving the party with Jessamyn. Mhm. I'm just trying to figure out what she's doing here. So you didn't buy the "I'm in Denver on business" line either? No. Mhm. Did she tell you the truth? Of course not. So it's a mystery. Yeah. Maybe I should investigate. Maybe you shouldn't. One second. Mason, what's up? Calm down, Mason. I can't hear you. What? Is she okay? Okay, yeah, no, I'll be right there. What's wrong? There's been an accident at Susie Craig's. Her grill exploded. Is she okay? She's dead. What? No, no, no, that's impossible. I was just with her. I was just there. What time did you leave? Um, probably just after you, around eight. Was she alone? Was there anyone else there? No. Fran Markesian was there. Is she okay? I don't know. I don't know. Goldy, I have to go. Are you gonna be okay? No, no, because I'm coming with you. No, Goldy. You can't come with me. She was my friend! This is a police matter. Tom, I was the last person to use that grill. ME? She's in the backyard, examining the body. Is that Goldy? Yeah, she was using the grill all day for a barbecue. I asked her to come take a look at it. So, like a witness? Not like a witness. A witness. I'm sorry. You gotta stop saying "like," Mason. You're a detective now, okay? - I know. Right. Oh, hey, Mason. I'm so sorry. I know you were friends. Thank you. All right, well, let's go. The 911 operator was alerted at 10:12 p.m. by the alarm company. Her smoke alarms were going off and she wasn't responsive on her phone. Fire crew and EMTs were here by 10:20. The fire inspector says it's a blocked regulator on the grill. That's impossible. It was a brand-new grill. So the danger with a propane grill is a blockage where the gas meets the ignition. Guys, I'll be back in a minute, all right? Let Goldy see the grill. Dr. Lockwood. What's going on? There's been an accident. Did you hear an explosion? An explosion? Yeah, about an hour ago. No, I was across town at this wild goose chase house call. Nevermind. Is Susie all right? She's dead. What? I'm so sorry. Does Richard know? No, I'll be calling him shortly. Anything I can do? Not at the moment. Okay, well, here's my card. All my numbers are there. Just take care, detective. Thank you. You too. No, there's no way. No way. What? That wasn't there when I left. What wasn't? Look. This was a brand-new grill. I cleaned the entire thing. You saw me. That was not there when I left. Tom. Yeah? What is this? It's pieces of a $900 bottle of tequila. How do you know? Because my ex-wife got it for Susie for her birthday. Oh. Tom. I don't like that face, Bella. What's up? Time of death is consistent with the 911 call of the fire. 10:00 p.m. Right, but I need to do a full autopsy, because my initial exam shows she has a broken hyoid bone, which likely means- She was strangled. Before the explosion. All right. This is a crime scene. We gotta get forensics on this entire house, and you- I need to go. I'll walk you out, Goldy. Hello. You've reached Dr. Richard Korman. I can't get to the phone at the moment, so please leave a message or call my service at 970. Hey, it is me again. Listen, just please call me back. Berry Good Catering. Oh, Goldy, this is Chrissie Brooks. Hey, Chrissie. Did you get my menu revisions? I did, but I'm sorry about this, Goldy. We're gonna have to cancel. Is everything okay? Yeah, just a change of plans. I can't really get into it. Okay, well, you know, if you cancel within five days, you don't get your deposit back. Yeah, I know. Well, unless you wanna reschedule for a later date. Uh, no, I'm sorry. I gotta run, but we're canceled. Something else awful happen? Hey, honey. No, no, no, no, no, no, nothing like last night. I've just had two people cancel their catering bookings this morning. Wow, you don't think- That I'm being blamed for my friend's death? Yes, I do. That's gross and unfair. I'm really sorry, Mom. Thanks, babe. Those scones smell good though. Here. They're from Marla's cafe. Thanks. So, have you talked to Dad? No, I have tried him many times, but he's not picking up. He's at his cabin. How do you know that? We're on the same family network. I used Find My Phone. You know, Tom better watch his back, or you're gonna take his job. Berry Good Catering. I understand. I hope so too. Yep. Thank you. That is my third cancellation this morning. You're being blamed for Susie's accident. Well, and the thing is, come here. What are you doing? Come here. Come with me. It wasn't an accident. Susie was murdered. What? Murdered? How do you know that? Because I was with Tom last night. Oka, okay, we're gonna go back to what you were doing with Tom last night, but who would wanna kill Susie? Well, that's what I need to find out. You mean that's what Tom has to find out. He's the detective. You run a catering business. Well, I might not have a business left to run if I don't find out what happened to Susie. 970-555-5120. Thank you. Is that everything? No, a few more boxes. Goldy and Marla are helping. What? What are you doing? Helping Mason. We walked up when he pulled in. Seriously? Yeah, great timing, right? Where do you want these? Where do I want these? I want you to put these down. What is your problem? My problem is persons of interest in an investigation shouldn't be handling evidence. Wait, this is evidence? I thought these were just Susie's work files. Mason! Yeah. Wait, persons of interest? Are you saying that we're suspects? What I'm saying is I need you to put the box down and tell me what you're doing here. I was at the cafe around the corner, having some coffee, and we just thought we would come down and, you know, see how everything's going. What's she not telling me? She's lost three bookings because of the exploding grill. People think she killed Susie. Ah. Accidentally, of course, because they don't know about the murder part. But you know about the murder part? Who else have you told? Nobody. Really? Not Richard? No. Why? Because he's not answering his cell or his on-call service line. He is at his fishing cabin. How do you know that if you haven't talked to him? Because he wasn't answering my call, so Olive used Find My Phone on our family plan to locate him. That's smart. I thought so too. Clever. Yeah, that's really smart. All right. What's the address? You can follow me. I'm not following you. This is a police investigation, Goldy. I understand that, but I actually care about Richard and would like to be there when you tell him that his girlfriend has been murdered. Is that a crime? Of course not. Great. Meet me at my van. You can follow me. See you later. Bye. Get the board started. What's the board? Well, that's his car. Richard! Dr. Korman! Oh. Well, it's open. Hey, that's breaking and entering. I'm not breaking anything and I'm not entering. Richard, it's Goldy! It's Detective Shultz! Goldy? Hey, what? What's going on? We need to talk. This is not possible. Dr. Korman, I need to know. When was the last time you saw Ms. Craig? I don't know. Yesterday at the party. We were talking. Goldy saw. I just can't believe that that was the last conversation. How did this happen? This is what we gotta figure out, which is why I need to ask you a few more questions. Whatever you need to know. All right, so you left the party. You went to Dr. Lockwood's. How long did you stay there? However long it takes to drink a cup of coffee. I don't know. An hour. And where'd you go from there? I drove straight here. And what did you do here? How is this going to help you find out how Susie's grill exploded? Dr. Korman. Wait a minute. You think that this wasn't an accident. Richard, just answer the question. No, no, no. Do I need a lawyer here? Not if you have nothing to hide. Of course I have nothing to hide, but you are being evasive. Was Susie... Was this not an accident? We have reason to believe it wasn't. Oh, wait a minute. You think that I killed her? I need to know what you were doing last night and if anyone was with you. Well, you thought that I went back to Susie's house? Your fingerprints were on the grill. Of course they were on the grill! I brought it to her last week. I loved Susie. We were gonna be married. You saw the ring. I know, I know. I know that this is so hard and I am so sorry, but just please answer Tom's questions, okay? Were you interrogated like this? Goldy was with your daughter at the time of Ms. Craig's death. And what time was that? We think just after 10. I was here. Alone? Yeah, me and my bourbon. Did you call anybody? Did you talk to anybody on the phone? No. I turned my phone off because I didn't want to have to deal with Susie. Okay, I'm sorry. I need to get a DNA swab if that's okay. You do what you have to do, detective. I have nothing to hide. The kit's in the car. Hey, what's going on? I'll show you, but, first, I need your whiteboard and markers. How'd it go with Richard? He said he was at his cabin at the time of death. I took a DNA swab. I'll run it to forensics. Also, I talked to Hal Bartholomew, who said his girlfriend Becca had him over for dinner last night. Can you verify that? No, because, according to her voicemail, she's on a flight to Australia. I added it to the board. It's very creatively done. Oh, yeah, you like that? Marla helped me. I'm just gonna take this. I just... Fran was the last person we saw with Susie, and she hasn't called Tom back, which is exactly what a guilty person would do. Or a busy person. Fair point. Chester and Susie ran the real estate firm together. Maybe he wanted to run it alone. Hm. He seems like a nice guy, which is the perfect cover for a killer. Or he's just a nice guy. Hm, maybe. He told Mason he was at home watching TV alone, which now brings us to the ex-husband. Hal? I mean, we all know that he loved Susie. Yeah, exactly, and if he couldn't have her, maybe he made sure no one would. He said he was having dinner with Becca Priester, but Mason hasn't been able to confirm that. Did Mason mention your would-be boyfriend Kenny? Because he had a motive. Susie was suing him, and her death saved him a whole lot of money. Well, Kenny told Mason that he was at Elk Park Fitness at the time of the murder, and Elise Hancock, she manages the place, confirmed he was there. Great, so the one person with a motive has an alibi. All right, speaking of bad blood with Susie, Dennis Lockwood. Did Mason check his house call alibi? Not yet. Hm. Now, what about Jessamyn? Jessamyn? She had never come up. Really? Wait, you don't think she- Well, I don't think she just happened to be in Denver on business. She was clearly here to see Susie. Or to see Tom. I mean, they did leave the party together. He said he was trying to figure out why she was in town. Well, did he? She was evasive. Evasive? Mhm. Well, I guess she does belong up here. Ooh, that is a lot of suspects. That's a lot of work. Oh. Oh, boy. What are you doing? Nothing. It doesn't look like nothing. Okay, I would feel awful if Mason got in trouble over this. Well, then feel awful, 'cause he's in trouble. Tom! Goldy, this isn't a menu you're planning! Someone was killed. We know that! It was our friend. Is it wrong that we feel terrible, but we also wanna help? No and yes, in that order. Look, the way Susie was killed has directly impacted my reputation and my livelihood. That's no excuse. You're pushing my partner for information. We would never do that. People just like talking to us. Also, I'm sorry, but Goldy was very helpful the last time you caught a killer, no? Thank you. Uh-huh. All right. Let's entertain the amateur detective thing for just a minute. Enlighten me. Who did it? Well, I would look into Dennis. He had complained to the neighborhood association about Susie. Hm, he did, but why would he draw attention to somebody if he intended to kill them? Oh, well, maybe he didn't plan it. Maybe it was spur of the moment. Except this was premeditated. Oh. Dr. Lockwood's bedroom window looks out over Susie's patio. The killer made sure that Dr. Lockwood wasn't at home at the time of the murder. The wild goose chase phone call. Right. The call came into his service from a patient named Len Gorch. When Dr. Lockwood went to go meet Len Gorch, he wasn't there. He was in Aspen for the weekend. Does the service have a record of who called to pretend to be Gorge? Yes, and we ran it. It's a disposable cell. The person that called Dr. Lockwood is a killer that thinks several steps ahead. This is not someone to mess with. You need to leave this to the professionals. Okay? Okay. Good. And take all of that down. You know, in high school, I was actually voted most likely to be detective. No way. Hey, how did- It's okay, it's okay. No harm done. Good. I'm really sorry. What did I tell you about apologies? Give them once and move on? Yeah. I got it. Sorry. That was an apology for the second apology, and now I'm moving on from that. Hey, I ran those background checks like you asked. And? Before she moved to Elk Park, Fran Markesian was police in Pittsburgh. She retired after 19 years. 19? I wonder why she didn't go the full 20 until her pension vests. That's what I wondered, so I made a call to my cousin who's on the job with the Allegheny County sheriff, and he said Fran was under investigation in a bribery scandal. Was? She retired and moved here. Good job, Mason. Good job, Mason. Good job, Mason. How can you say that? I loved Susie. That's slander, Chester. Hal! You'll be talking to my attorney. Hi, Hal. Are you okay? Excuse me, Goldy. Goldy. Hi. I'm sorry, Hal's- No, it's okay. I brought food. Lovely. Thank you. I just wanted to come by and just tell you how sorry I am. I still can't believe it. It's just insane. Hal... Yeah, what's going on? You know that Hal used to be a partner here? Sure, until the divorce, and then he started his own firm. Well, apparently, according to him, he and Susie were ready to merge his real estate agency with ours. And you didn't know about this? I know, when we talked about it last week, Susie was against the merger. So do you think he changed her mind or he's lying? I'd vote for number two. Hal's sales numbers are dismal. As I told him, beyond it being a classless, craven move to come at me the day after Susie... Susie owned a controlling interest in this firm, 65%, and I would like to hope that interest will go to me, but I won't know that until after we see her will, which will hopefully happen by tomorrow. Right, of course. I mean, we haven't even had a funeral yet, and he's in here. Hey. Hey, I am so sorry. Who could have done this to her? I don't know, but I do know that Detective Shultz will find out. Come on in, fellas. Have a seat. So, how do you know Susie Craig? I started working insurance claims for her and went from there. Went where? Different jobs. Any current? Yeah, one that's protected by confidentiality law. She's deceased. I'm not. I thought she was your friend. Does that line usually work on people? You'd be surprised. So there's nothing I can do to get you to open your books to me? A court order, but you'd need probable cause, which I don't see here, detective. Would I need a court order to get you to tell me why you left the police force in Pittsburgh? We're done here. I'll get a judge, and I'll get you a court order for your records. Mason. Oh, do you want this closed? Yes. I have a feeling she's hiding something. Oh, yeah? What makes you think that? Well, when she scratched her nose- I was kidding. Oh. You're gonna watch her, okay? I am? Yeah, you're gonna park across the street. Keep your distance. Cool. Where are you going? I'm following a lead. Flying solo. Oh, hey, Dennis. Goldy, how's Richard? Not great. Has he not been in the office? Actually, I've been out. I've been doing house calls. Didn't you have one of those last night? Well, yeah, in theory, but my patient was actually in Aspen. Detective Shultz seems to think I was called away so I wouldn't be a witness to, you know, everything that happened at Susie's. Of course. I'm sorry. I gotta run. Oh, go ahead, yeah. Take care. Okay, you too. Thank you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! There we go. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah. No, no, you scared me to death! I scared you to death? Yes! You scared me to death. You just fell. I did not fall! You just fell. Because you grabbed me. Goldy, what are you doing here? I told you, you can't be snooping around. I know what you told me. That's why I texted you about Hal. Which is why I'm here. Why are you here? Well, you know, I was in the neighborhood. You were in the neighborhood? And you didn't get back to me. Oh, so this is my fault? I think we both share responsibility. Can you tell me what's going on? Detective Kildea. Kildea, detective. Detective. Detective Kildea. Yeah. Freeze! Detective Kildea. And it's empty. I mean, obviously, Hal is in financial trouble. Well, you don't know that... He could have just been preparing the merge with Susie's company. And, what, Susie never said anything to Chester? That's assuming Chester's telling you the truth. Fair point. So, one of them is lying. Depending on what Susie's will says, we'll get a clear idea of who. I just wanna know what Jessamyn was doing in an empty office. Yeah, exactly. Hi, Fran. Um, can I help you find something? Oh, I'm looking at your fitting rooms. Well, do you wanna try something on? Oh, no, no, a woman went in there and I'm just- Oh, yeah, no. No, not like that. I'm Detective Kildea, Elk Park PD. I'm tracking a suspect who went into your fitting rooms, and, obviously, I can't follow her in there. A thief? No, no, nothing to do with your shop here. Okay. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no! Sir? Is there a back door out that way? Yes. Mason, calm down. Yeah, it's okay, all right? Just get the security footage ready. I'll be there in five minutes. Fran knew she was being tailed. There's no way she would shop at Posh. Why? You'll see when we get there. We? Right, of course. Nope. Good luck! Don't you have cameras in the rooms? Um, it's illegal. Right. Just checking. So, whoever needed Dennis away from his house had to know that Len Gorch was his patient, but who would? Me. Len tried to defect me a few months ago. What do you mean defect? Look, I've picked up quite a few patients that used to see Dennis. He says it gives him more time to spend at his villa in Italy, which is a real shame, because he's a brilliant surgeon, and I'm sure that his billable hours have taken a massive hit. Hey, Dad, can Zoe stay over for s'mores? Sure, as long as it's okay with Zoe's folks. Yes. Thanks. Oh, does Tom know that Susie was suing Kenny Zox? Yes, but Kenny was at the gym last night. I checked. Elk Park Fitness. I'm assuming. Why? Because there's a jogging trail that runs from there and it goes past the back of Susie's house. Now, a guy like Kenny could make it there in five minutes. It's not like I want it to be him. I just- Of course not. I'm trying to figure this out. I know. Are you sure you wanna take Olive tonight? I can take her. No, I'm fully committed to s'mores. Okay. Don't forget. The bus to the Utah tournament leaves here at 7:00 a.m. That's right. Okay, bye. Bye. Bella, what's up? Well, the explosion definitely made it a challenge, but I can say categorically that she was strangled with a ligature that cut into the papillary dermis, the superficial layer of the skin. Cut into? Well, do you think the killer used a wire? Fluorocarbon fishing line. You sound sure about that. Forensics came back with the material that clogged the grill, mostly latex. Are they thinking gloves? What else? And they were able to isolate another material that was melted into the latex. Fluorocarbon. Uh-huh. Is there any way of telling what kind of brand of fishing line that is? I can tell you it's lime green. It's a match for lime green fishing line found in Susie's garage with one set of prints on it. Thanks, Bella. Excuse me. Can I help you? Oh, yeah. I'm just going to see Detective Shultz. He's out on a call. Okay. You're welcome to wait. Thank you. Tom! Tom. What? Goldy, what are you doing here? What are you doing? Not now, okay? I'll talk to you in a minute. You asked me to call you, but you don't call me? It's different. Clearly. You're calling me because I'm the detective investigating a crime. I am also your friend, and I would think that you would give me a heads-up before you arrest my daughter's father. I was going to call you. When? When I knew more. More about what? Do you really think that Richard killed Susie? I mean, that is insane! Goldy. What about Hal, Chester, Fran, Kenny? Wait, what am I doing on here? I'm looking into all of them. No one is being charged yet. Richard is in handcuffs! You have to trust me to do my job. And you need to trust me when I tell you that there is no way that Richard would ever do anything like this! Okay. I'm sorry for yelling. I understand. Can I at least go talk to him? Hey, Chester. How are you holding up? As best as I can. What can I get you? A large latte and one of those scones. Okay. To go? No, I'm meeting someone. All right. Just grab a table. Apparently, the fishing line that strangled her is the same kind that I use. I'm still not understanding. Is this some kind of rare fishing line? I mean, I do have to special order it, but, Goldy, I would never. No. Hey. I know. I know. I'm gonna figure out who did this before Olive gets back, okay? I promise. Hello. Goldy, it's Chrissie Brook. Oh, hi, Chrissie. Listen, our party's back on. Is it now? I hope you're still available. Um. Sure. Yes. Oh, great. Hey. Hey, I just heard about Richard. I can't believe it. Because it's not believable, and apparently word is all over town, because Chrissie Brooks just called, and suddenly the party's back on now that I'm in the clear. Oh, well, I'm sure everyone will be un-canceling, but I didn't call about that. So, Chester comes in, and then Jessamyn shows up, and she's the one he's meeting. They sat at this table, but what they didn't know is that this heating grate leads to this one, so I stood here and listened to what they had to say in case it had something to do with Susie's death. Need I remind you that there's a lot at stake? Did it? Oh, yeah. Apparently, Jessamyn now works for a real estate firm in San Francisco, and she promised her bosses that she could make a deal to buy Whitetail Realty. Wait, now, was Chester surprised by this? No. It sounded like it was his idea. Now they're just waiting for the will to be read. Yeah, them and Hal. Hal? So, Jessamyn also met with him. Supposedly, he wanted to merge his company with Whitetail Realty, but it sounds like it would be more of a rescue. Did she say anything about him? No, not that I heard. So, what do we do? We go back to my whiteboard. Preston Pittman is Susie's attorney. I will ask him about the will. Jessamyn's been at her firm for nine months. She hasn't made a sale yet. Mr. "Better Call Hal" laid off his staff, but he hasn't filed for bankruptcy yet. Fran's not answering. I've left messages at her office and on her cell. Hey, so I reached Elise at Elk Park Fitness. Because they have digital IDs, she knows that Kenny was there from 8:00 to 10:20 p.m., and then I pressed. Did she see him working out the whole time? And? She did, except when he was in the locker room. How long was he in there? About a half an hour. That gives him time to kill Susie at the time that she was murdered. It's not proof, but it's something. What would proof be? I do know that Susie was killed with fishing line, so if we found that? What if I distract Kenny, and get him away from his house long enough for you to search it? Oh, Kenny! Marla? What are you doing here? I thought that was you. Are you okay? Mhm, just give me a second. Can I get you some water? No, I got a flat, just a few houses down, and I saw you driving past and I ran to catch you. Oh, wow. Kismet. Yeah, yeah, kismet, and, you know, I have never changed a tire before. I got you, Marla. Oh, thank you. Come on. Okay, so this is your jack and this is your jack handle. And that was just in there? Yeah, every car comes with them. Who knew? We're gonna raise this up a bit more here. Wow. And now we're gonna take these lug nuts off. So, this one is called the donut. Oh, I love donuts. It's not an edible donut. There. Here we go. Oh, that's so amazing. But before you drive it out, are you a wine person? I've been known to have a glass or two, yeah. I also love me some wine. Wow. Okay. I've got this nice bottle of Merlot I picked up when I went to this amazing winery, and I think you need to definitely try some, Marla. Oh, gosh. I just realized what time it is right now. I'm gonna be late for choir practice. You sing at a choir? Mhm. I had no idea. Oh, yeah, yeah, and I would skip it, but I'm the soloist this week. Oh, okay. Have fun. Okay. ♪ Amazing grace ♪ ♪ How sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ How many verses did you have to sing? The man had tears in his eyes, Goldy, because it was the song they sang at his grandmother's funeral. Suddenly, I feel awful tricking this guy. Well, maybe you shouldn't. Did you find the fishing line? No, but I did find this. It is a letter from Preston Pittman, Susie's attorney, about the lawsuit they filed. Read this. "Please be advised that my client, Ms. Craig, has recorded conversations in which you made threats on her life. That is the phone call that Kenny was having at the party. Remember when he said, "I won't hurt her in a room full of witnesses"? They must have been talking about that letter, so it's not proof that he killed her, but it is proof that he wanted to. Hi. Thanks for seeing me, Preston. Of course. This is for you. Thank you. Yeah. How are you holding up? I'm a mess, honestly. Yeah. And how's Olive? Away at a softball tournament for the next couple of days, thankfully. Yeah. She doesn't know what's going on with her dad. I'm sure he'll be out on bail before she gets back. I heard he retained Sarah Langsam. She's Elk Park's best criminal defense attorney. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Listen. I know that Susie has recorded conversations of Kenny Zox threatening her. How do you know this? I just do, and I just wanted to know if you would turn those tapes into the police. Goldy, there were no recordings. The day she was killed, Susie confessed to me that she had fabricated the threats to try to get out of their project together. Kenny was unpleasant and aggressive, but she had no tapes. Speaking of letters, I thought you'd called because you'd gotten mine. What letter? The a copy of Susie's will. Why would I get a copy of Susie's will? Because you're in it. What? I have a copy here. She left you her antique Fiestaware. Hi. My way of apologizing for yelling at you yesterday. No apology needed, but I'll take it. Wait a second. This is not quid pro quo, right? Pastry in exchange for information about the case. How dare you? I am actually here to tell you about the case. Susie Craig's will? How'd you get this? I'm named in it. I get her Fiestaware, but look who gets her house and her share of Whitetail Realty. Hal, her ex-husband? Mhm, she never changed the will after the divorce, much to her lawyer's chagrin, which means Hal- Hal gets to inherit her company. Yep, and he is selling to Jessamyn. What? That is why she came back to Elk Park, and Chester knew about it. Thanks for coming. You didn't make it sound like I had a choice. I've never been on the receiving end of your work. I'm not sure I like it. It's come to my attention that Hal Bartholomew has inherited Susie Craig's company. Do you think Hal killed her? No, he has an alibi for the time of death, but I do think you are here in Elk Park to buy the company from him. How do you know that? Is it true? I came here to buy the company from Susie. Really? Susie wasn't against selling? She was at first. She liked playing hardball. Here's an email from Susie to me sent the day before her party, once I got to the right price point. "Jess, we've got a deal." Why didn't you tell me this? Because the deal isn't done. I didn't wanna jeopardize it. This is a homicide investigation, Jess! I know what it is, Tommy. My friend is the homicide, but this deal has nothing to do with her being murdered. Okay. I'm sorry I had to press you. Anyway, Hal's gonna sell Whitetail to me once he takes possession, so you know. Hal had no idea he was still in her will. Yesterday, he was begging me to hire him if Chester went ahead with the deal. Tom, we found Fran Markesian! Copy that. Ma'am, you can't be here. I know. It's okay. It's okay. You can't blame Richard for this. You've had him locked up. Based on how long the body's been in the water, she was killed Monday after Mason lost her at Posh, the night before I arrested Richard. He was with me. He was with me that night at Olive's practice. There were dozens of witnesses. What time did he arrive? Practice was at eight. He was maybe 20 minutes late. Bella is pegging time of death for 6:00 p.m. I'm sorry. Are you sorry? Do you think I wanna like Richard for this? I have to follow the evidence. Evidence? You know that anybody could have put her in that river! Her gun wasn't on her. I had deputies go to Richard's house. They found it on his back porch under the grill. No. I'm sorry. There's something missing. A missing ingredient. A missing ingredient. Hey, Goldy. It's been a minute. Can I help you find something? Actually, I have a bit of an odd question. I'm here to ask about a woman named Fran Markesian. Oh, Fran. I just heard she was murdered. It's beyond awful. I know, I know. It really is. Was she a customer here? Fran? No, not really. How did you guys know each other? Well, we kept getting robbed last year, so we hired her as a consultant to overhaul our security system. Installed some new cameras and redid the fitting rooms. Fitting rooms? Yeah. Do you wanna see? Yeah. Yeah, so she got rid of all the places that thieves could hide sales tags, pulled up the carpets, closed off the space underneath the benches. Oh. Oh, I just need to help a customer. I'll be right back, okay? - Yeah, no worries. What? Dennis, let me go. Why would I do that? Do you not think Fran has another copy? No, I'm sure of it. That's her computer there. Yeah, I took it out of her office after I shot her. Did Susie threaten you? Oh, quite the opposite. She came over after the party. She apologized for all the trouble she caused. Your complaints. They started all of this. You wanted to force her to sell. Why? So I could buy it. I treasure my privacy and our houses are quite close. My bedroom looks out over her patio, which was actually advantageous the night of the party. I knew why she was apologizing to me, why she was suddenly scared, because of what Fran found out about my villa in Italy. You were performing illegal surgeries on Italian patients, the mafia. They don't like to use that word, but they pay extremely well, and with your ex-husband stealing all my patients away- You needed the mafia to keep you afloat financially. And, well, I really couldn't count on Susie keeping quiet, and I wasn't willing to give up my license to practice medicine, and I didn't want my Italian friends upset with me, so. You called your own service line from the disposable cell. This is Len Gorch. I need Dr. Lockwood at my home immediately. My back is seized up. Dr. Lockwood. Mr. Gorge needs to see you, doctor. But it's Sunday night. Should I call Dr. Franklin? No, no, no, I'm going. Then you put the gloves and the fishing line in the grill, pretending to hide the evidence in the explosion. You knew forensics would figure it out. You didn't just need an alibi for yourself. You needed someone to take the fall. Well, fortunately, there was a likely suspect, and, with Fran, she was more than willing to ask for a million dollars to keep quiet, so I agreed to give it to her in a secluded spot, and I gave her the same sedative that I gave to you. How did you know that Fran hid the files at Posh? I didn't. I just knew I had to be concerned about you, because Richard couldn't stop bragging about how you solved the Laura Smiley murder. You were following me. Why am I still alive? Come now. Don't stop being clever. No. No. You know why. You're waiting for Richard to make bail, and you're gonna blame him for my murder. That's half right. I'm gonna take care of both of you. Murder-suicide. No, no, no, no, no! Goldy! I can't believe this is happening. What a nightmare. Thank you so much. Richard. Dennis. Surgery ran long. I wanted to be here. Looks like you won. Well, I got bail. I'm a long way from winning. You will beat this, Richard. No jury in the world would believe that you could commit murder. Well, thanks, Dennis. Look, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to grab an Uber. Let me take you, and, hey, we can drop by my place for a celebratory glass of wine. A little early in the day. A celebratory iced latte? Sure. Great. Thanks. Can you zoom in? Yeah. Wait a second. Who is that? I don't know. You're the detective. Dennis! Come on. I'm gonna go fire up the espresso machine. It takes a couple minutes to warm up, so why don't you go shoot some pool and I'll bring it in to you when it's ready? Sounds good. Are you okay? Yeah. How did you- Long story. Hurry. Hey, one or two shots? Hurry. Hurry. Okay. Two would be great! Thank you! Show me your hands. Easy, easy. Show me your hands! Tom, the needle. What? Let her go! I swear. Let her go! You okay? Yeah. Yeah. What the heck is going on? I don't know what to say, but thank you, both of you. Well, the right man's locked up, and he will be for a long time. Oh. Hey, honey, you're on speakerphone with Dad and Tom. We're going to the finals! - Aw! - Oh, that's fantastic. - Congratulations! - That's great, Olive. That's such good news. Thanks! How are you guys? You know what? I'm gonna let Dad talk to you. Here you go. Hey, honey. It's been a trying day, to say the least. Some job you have. I sure am glad that you're doing it here. Uh, Goldy, I told her about what kind of day you've had, and she wants to hear your voice. Okay. I'm sorry, Tom. No, no, I got a lot of paperwork. You guys take care. Thank you, detective. My pleasure. Take care. Hi, honey. Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. Thank you. Yeah, so you won? That's incredible! We're so proud of you!
