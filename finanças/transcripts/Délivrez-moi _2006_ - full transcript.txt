FORGIVE ME Hi. Sign here. The door was open. I leave it open when it's hot. Would you like a lemonade? Yes. Please. Sit down. Thank you. Where's Sophie? Visiting the islands. She's there all day now that school's over. She comes home for supper. Let's go see your dolls. Want to play with the dolls? Go play with them. You can eat here, if you want. Okay. You can sleep here too. Not for long, 2 or 3 nights. Till I get my train ticket. For Vancouver. Ir?ne! Sophie? I found him like this! I don't understand! He's dead. - We were playing! - Hi, Sophie. It's me. So... How's school going? No school in summer. I know. I mean, how did the year go? You good in English? In everything. I'm first in my class. Wow, you don't get that from me! Did you keep my letters? Well, I think it's bedtime, Sophie. It's been a hard day. You have all day tomorrow to catch up. Good night, Fifi. I kept your letters. It was better for her. The less she heard about jail... You didn't give her my letters? Not even her birthday cards? I drew them myself! I gave her a summary. I told her everything you wanted to say. Why? Why...? Why'd you do it? You've n You've no right, she's my daughter! What will you tell her? When she asks you, "Why did you kill my father?" The truth. The truth? Or your truth? Goodbye, Maxou. HIRING NOW It says you used to work here. When? I never saw you. 10 years ago. 10 years? I was up north. I was a bush pilot. Well, Annie, it's your lucky day. I'm all for rehabilitation. I can give you a job in the office. I'd rather work on the floor, if it's okay. The pay's better. The floor? It's rough there. If I wanted to do embroidery, I wouldn't be here. Okay, you start tomorrow. Good. You'll see, you breathe the ore. You can't hear yourself talk. You die of the heat. It's hell. But you get used to it. Like for everything. You're so pretty. They're pretty, him especially. They're identical, same litter. Yeah, but he likes me more. $350's for the pair? Course not, it's per dog. They're Bichons. Shit! Here. - We're not waiting for her? - No. I'm not running a hotel. Lord, thank you... I'll take it. Want a lift to the station? No. I'll say goodbye to Sophie for you, if you want. Yeah, sure. Good luck, my girl. Good luck in your new life. I'll see you, Ir?ne. Yes, that's right. Chance, destiny... Wait. Here, a vegetable couscous. It can be eaten cold. So you want a case review? Yeah, I need one. Why do you need it? Cause things have changed. What's changed? Well, I'm out. And I'm free. And I have a job. Isn't your girl happy there? A girl should be with her mom. Depends on the mom. I'm her mom, I want my daughter. I'll help you, but on one condition. What? No bullshit. Ever. You have to be honest with me. Deal. Why are you grinning? What do you mean? Do you think I'm joking? No. You tried suicide in jail. When I arrived. Then I got used to it. My file says I behaved after that. And my file also says... I read your file. Are you back on drugs? I'm totally clean. Martine, if you get me my daughter back... It's really important for me. I'll give you anything. I'll do anything. Anything. Stop it. I'll try. That's okay. Fifty cents. It was me in the flames. We're hard to recognize, in our disguises. I recognize you. The cleaning gal. You just started? My name's Ghislain. Annie. I know. You know my name? And lots more, too. Do you live far? Want a lift? No, I like to walk. What else do you know? That you're really pretty. Like to go for a beer? I don't drink. Not even water? Come on, I know a nice quiet spot. I'm not going to grow old here. I already saved up a bundle. Oh yeah? I'm going to buy me a new bike, a big one. - Yeah? Which one? - A 1200. Do you like to travel? Sure do. Where'd you go? Have you been to Peru? No, not to Peru. There are people and landscapes like none you've ever seen. In Ayacucho, there are Indians who live like they did 2,000 years ago. When are you going? Soon as I have the cash. You're not gonna grow old here either. - That's obvious. - Nope. Nope, I'm moving to Vancouver. Vancouver? That's for old farts. Why Vancouver? My daughter and I want to live by the ocean. You'll be bored to death. It's good stuff, try it. No. You've never tried? Sure I've tried, I'm still high. So you have a girl? A lovely grown-up girl. She must be cute, just like you. Hold me. I'm going. No, I'll go. Hold me. - You want it. I won't hurt you. - No. It's okay. I'll go. - You sure? - Yeah. See you tomorrow. Yeah, see you. Fuck! Hi, Fifi. So, how was it? The usual. She upstairs? She left for Vancouver. It's better like this. She says goodbye. Dear Sophie. We have to talk. Meet me after diner. Apartment 3. Annie. Go on, do it! At worst you'll smash your face. C'mon, jump. Fuck! You're scared! What's happening? Where you going? Don't go away. Want a beer? How bout a joint? C'mon, shit! Okay, forget it. Yes? I just have to check something. What? I'm finished. I'm coming, Mom. Disappointed to see me? No. Expecting your guy? My daughter. Your daughter? Good, I can meet her. Well, I'd prefer to be... alone with her, if you don't mind. It's the first time. That's fine. All I ask is that you're honest. Like some chips? I haven't settled in so I don't have... Where will she sleep? This is small. I'll take her to... To where? To a nicer neighbourhood. Why do you have so many? I like them. You like these? For yourself or others? - What do you mean? - Do you strip? Of course not. You did in jail. You even did it for money. Well, did you? Jail was another life. Don't you have a boyfriend? No, I'm staying out of trouble. I stay home, go to bed early. A real little saint! Little saint! You came! Am I too late? No! What time is it? - Want some ice cream? - No. Come on, I bought it just for you. Shit, it's all melted! We'll drink it. It'll taste amazing! Strawberry ice cream juice and vinegar chips. The perfect hostess! Here, you have the big one. Grab some chips, there's lots. It's not bad. I have lousy manners, huh? Sorry, you'll have to teach me. You didn't go to Vancouver? No. Why not? I'm waiting for you. I thought about you every day. Look, I tattooed it myself. Look. I have the same birthmark in the same place. It shows we have the same blood. I have to go. Already? You just got here. Will you come back? I won't tell Ir?ne. Cool. Marco, be nice. Stop it. Stop it! Sophie? It's me. You're a real slut, huh? Sorry! Mom! I didn't hear you. So you're Annie? - Mom! - Okay, sorry. Sorry. It's just for now. I'll move out in the fall. It's okay to like your family. They're the pits. You told them about me? Maybe, I don't remember. Sophie, you didn't eat dessert. It stinks. What do you mean? You like pig's knuckles. Not after supper. Tomorrow I'll make spaghetti sauce. Then the day after, boiled vegetables. Poor people all smoke but never eat vegetables. I'm exhausted. Why don't you stop? Who makes you? God does! God makes me. Of course it's easier to be selfish, to live like animals. I can deliver them in town for you. Would you? Yes. You're so sweet. So sweet. Sophie? Sophie! Alright! I can't stay long. Here... What is it? It smells of carrots, celery, and Ir?ne's soap! Pig's knuckles. It's her best recipe. You have to heat it up! I wanted to taste it. It'll be good. There's a pot there, in the corner. Put it on low. Or it'll stick. Okay, boss. I'll get a match. Can't you cook? - Didn't your mom teach you? - Don't have one. Maybe I did at first. I don't remember. And your family? I have you. Can you do this? Do you know this one? I love hearing you laugh. I have to go. Make my deliveries. Alright. Bye. Why'd she kill him? I told you. Tell me again. She killed him because she couldn't bear to see him ill. - So she loved him. - No, she didn't! If you love someone, you look after him, you don't kill him! What illness did he have? He was... He was sad. Sad? That's not an illness! But it can become one... If it goes on it can become a sort of... madness. But you can be cured. Lots of people are. He doesn't look sad in photos. That was before he met her. He was fine, before he met her. She drove him mad and killed him. That's what she did. May she burn in hell! You stink of Bichon. You stink! Marco, come on. Marco, be nice. Stop it! You're not allowed to camp here. It's a nature reserve. No hunting or fishing. Milan. I hate poachers. Just a puff, so we're both in the same mood. Go on! Shit, you drive me wild! I love it when you straddle me. C'mon, show me who's boss. Like you did with the women inside. Stop it. You terrorized those dykes! You must've been tough. Show me what you did. No, Ghislain, stop it. You never talk about jail. - I don't mind. - It's my business. Look at me when I talk to you! Shit, I love it! You turn me on! I dream about you every night. I picture you naked with a gun. Or I see you in prison, eating those pussies. Look at me, I'm talking! C'mon, act tough with me. Put on your tough act. C'mon, shit! C'mon, act tough with me, Christ! Act tough with me! Stop it! You're a slut! Yes! I love it! What are you doing? I have to go. Christ, you can't stop now! My girl's waiting. C'mon, shit! What do you want? Not on my shoes, fucking pisser! Get over here! It's the 4th time! Stay there! Fuck! Yes? Talk to Sophie? Fine. She doesn't want to talk to you. She can tell me that herself. Sorry! I'm making tea. Do you want some? Yeah, okay. - Is that your family? - Yes. They're still back home, in Mitrovitsa. Thanks. In the cemetery. The war was like a country fair. There are shoot'em dolls. The dolls fall over. If you see them as dolls, it's easy. Saturdays, with my pal Miklav, we'd join the militia for the day. We'd go shoot Muslims in Sarajevo. Muslim dolls, I mean. One Saturday night, coming home, someone like me, but Muslim, maybe, or Croat... Someone had visited my house to shoot himself some Serbs. What's your name? Annie. You can't go over 200, cause your pistons start to knock... In no time, your engine seizes. I could do 200 on my Harley. 200? Gimme a break, fuck's sake. Yeah, 200, but not for long. Just to fly for a little while. - Have you met Annie? - No. Hi. You'd never guess it, but Annie did 10 years in jail. For homicide, fuck! Come on! I didn't mean anything. Besides, everyone knows. Come on! I don't mind that you did time. It's cool. I just said it to get a rise. You're such an ice queen. Fuck, Annie! You really turn me on! C'mon, get on. There's enough vegetables for 2 days. Eat a quarter tomorrow for lunch, a quarter for supper. Same thing Thursday. 2 days of the same food, I'm going to get tired of it. Jokes aside, you're a good soul, Ir?ne. I mean, having to put up with it. It must be awful. There she is, free as a bird, after what she did, like nothing had happened. Who are you talking about? Her, your... daughter-in-law. She could've at least left town. Where did you see her? I see her everyday. She goes by everyday on her way to the mill. She works at the mill. We must forgive, Mrs. Bissonnette. That's what the Bible teaches us. To forgive. She paid her debt, she did her time. We must forgive. Too nice. Me, I can't help it. Each time I see her my stomach churns. The worst thing is, she lives next door. Next door? If it's okay... I'll take back my containers. I'll come by Friday. Not boiled vegetables again, I hope. - Hi, Sophie. You came! - Hi. What... Come inside. I have a surprise. Come on. Back up. Sit down. Wait here. You peeked, cheater! He's yours. Are you happy? What's wrong? He's cute. Cute? Is that all? Don't you like him? What'll I tell Ir?ne? Tell her? I dunno, you found him in the street. In the street, sure! A Bichon! What is it with your Bichons? He's a mutt like any other! He pees everywhere! Maxou was special. He's dead. Stop whining! I paid $300 for that fucking dog. I've no TV, my first pay went to buy him. I don't want a new dog! You're spoiled, just like your grandma! A goddamn spoiled rich bitch! Sophie, I didn't mean it, forgive me! Please don't go! Don't leave me! - Don't leave me! - Stop it. Get up. You drove him crazy and killed him. Everybody says so. What? I drove him crazy? Did your Grandma say that? She's crazy! The whole family's crazy! I loved him like nobody else could. I gave him everything. That angel face of his... I tried everything to make us happy. But he was crazy. I paid for it. I did my time. Now all I want is to live in peace. No, Sophie. Wait a minute! Just hold on. I'm sorry. Please take your dog. He's getting to me. It's me. Yes. Look, I found a dog. Well, look. He was on the island. Can I keep him? I guess so. Thanks. Something you want to tell me? Something? About the dog? She's my mother. It's my right to see her. Yes. It's the secrets, the lies that aren't acceptable. You're the liar. She didn't kill him like you said. She killed him because he asked. He asked her to do it. Sophie, why was she sentenced to 10 years in jail? The innocent don't go to jail. I want to see her. You can't stop me. No, I won't stop you. You're a big girl, and smart. You'll figure out the truth by yourself. Wait. I'm sure she has no mementos of Marco. Give her this from me. Don't be late, that's all I ask. Well, go on. Open it. She's okay with your coming here? Well, yeah. Maybe I misjudged her. We'll be together real soon. She'll never agree. The court will decide, not her. Here, pull. What is it? Shit! What is it? Don't touch it. Sophie? Can I come in? I won't let her. I won't let her destroy you too. I swear to you, I won't let her. Goddamn idiot! Beat it, jerk! Change shifts? Where've you been? What's happening? Nothing's happening. Nothing happened, nothing will. C'mon, you're my girlfriend. No, I'm your slut. What's wrong, am I too rough? - You like it rough. - It's not that. You know I love you. What do you want me to do? Tell me, shit! Let go, you're hurting me. - You're hurting me too. - Ghislain! Come to my office. Damnit, I love you, Annie! Marco... Don't be scared, you're in your own home. I'm the stranger. Have a beer. Go ahead, I know you're drinking again. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be here. I should be at home. But I don't have one. No place where I can tell myself: You're home, take it easy, this is your place. Know how lucky you are? Cause you're free. You have a life, a place of your own. Do you realize? Were you with your guy? We broke up. Good move! Men always let you down. I was working. I inspected your place. It's perfect, clean. I marked it all down. In here, it's all good marks. No, please, Martine. What did you say to me? "Martine, "get me my daughter, I'll give you anything." What did you mean by that? You're just a tease! C'mon! Did I tell you to stop? - Good show? Men allowed? - Who are you? Hey, relax. Watch the show. Let go of me. - Dance! - Ghislain, scram! You better let go. Goddamn dyke! Ghislain, beat it! Let go! - You like thrills? - Let go! Well, try this! Get off her! Get off her! Get off me! Calm down! Get off me! Leave her alone! Beat it! Beat it! What have you done? You ruined everything! What'll I do now? Beat it! Leave me alone! I'm screwed! So... We've considered the application of Annie Godin, residing at 119 Maurice St, filed July 27, 2004, to rescind the order of September 5, 1994, which granted legal guardianship of the infant Sophie Delage to her tutrix and grandmother, Ir?ne Delage, residing at 245 du Chenal Blvd. The file was prepared by Martine Chalifoux, her probation officer. The report on Ms Godin's situation, supported by the attached statements of witnesses, shows that although the applicant has found regular employment, she has led an unstable lifestyle since her release. Despite the evidence, and without interim orders, we believe the applicant, who as a child was in the care of 6 foster families... we believe the applicant... parental responsibilities... 6 foster families... is likely to see an improvement of her emotional state by being granted parental responsibilities. We believe that the best environment for a child's development is close contact with the mother. Consequently we grant Annie Godin guardianship of Sophie Delage until she becomes of age, subject to further evaluation to be arranged by legal authorities. Martine, I want to... Thank you! Good luck! Don't look! I'm ugly when I'm like this. Sophie! Where are you, beautiful? Pack your stuff, we're leaving! Let's go! Didn't you hear? You're coming with Mom. With the blessing of the goddamn court system! We'll go to Vancouver and never come back! C'mon, let's celebrate! We'll get your stuff tomorrow. I don't want to. To go to Vancouver. That's okay, we'll go... someplace else. I don't want to. - I'm staying with Gran. - Come on! I'm your mom, you're coming! Stop, I don't love you. You're scaring me! Will you take her by force? Will you lock her up? Those judgements mean nothing if she doesn't want to. Where will it get you? Think about it. Would you leave with the person who killed your father? What you did can't be healed. It can never be healed. Your life is over. And you know it. Help me. Help me, Marco. You're all I have. There's no one else. I need something. Come in. I need a gun. He's so pretty. He looks like Maxou. Where did you find him again? Sophie! Miss... It's nice to see friends together. We're not friends. We're brothers-in-arms. That's how Serbs are. We laugh so as not to cry. Miklav spends half his time in a locked ward. The war drove him crazy. We were lucky to find... A very good gun for the price. Dying is so easy. We're all going to die. Death is everywhere, even when there's no war. But living, still being alive, that is a miracle. Thanks. Sophie! Let's go see your dolls. Want to play with the dolls? You know this has to end. Shoot me. Give me the gun, I'll help you. It's the only way, huh? Don't be scared. I'll protect you when I'm dead. I'll protect you. That's it, don't be scared. I'll protect you. Come on. Don't be scared. You'll be fine. God will look after you. Shut up! Wait! Wait! It's the only way. It's over. It's the only way, huh? Forget it. Forget it. Shoot. Go on, shoot. Shoot. Forget it. Give me that. - Give me that. - No. It'll be better this way. I killed him, Sophie. - I know. - No, you don't know. No, you don't know. I killed him. Sous-titres: Arigon
