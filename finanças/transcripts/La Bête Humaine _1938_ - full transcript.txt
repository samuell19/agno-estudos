"At times this hereditary flaw weighed heavily upon him. He felt he was paying the price for the generations of his forefathers whose drinking had poisoned his blood. His head felt as if it would explode in the throes of his suffering. He was compelled to commit acts beyond the control of his will, acts whose causes lay hidden deep within him." - Did you feel that? - Yes. The axle box is overheated. It's not for lack of oil. She's knocking it back. Did you see your wife in Paris, Pecqueux? - Yes, Mr. Roubaud. - How is she? Fine. She's such a complainer, but somehow we get by. Sir, I have a complaint. There's a man with a dog. Please come this way. Overheated. It's ruined. You're just causing trouble. What's the problem with my dog? The regulations don't allow dogs in the compartments. I don't like your tone of voice. Do you know who I am? I don't need to know. I make no distinctions among passengers. Well, I'll teach you to make some. What's your name? - Roubaud, stationmaster. - You'll be hearing from me. And you from me. I'll be submitting my report. - Roubaud, did you say? - Yes, and I'm proud of it. - Thank you. Very kind of you. - Not at all, ma'am. Some people need to be taught a lesson. - You know who that fellow is? - No. That's Turlot, the sugar tycoon. He's got lots of clout. He's already gotten two people fired. He could ruin your career. But that woman voiced a formal complaint. - All right. - Here we go. - Hello, Roubaud. - Hello, Inspector. - Aren't you working nights? - Luckily not right now. Join us for cards at the caf? later? I'm not so keen on cards. Besides, the wife's waiting. Lucky devil! Hello. Good day, Miss Dauvergne. Hello, stranger. You must stop by and see my wife. I'd hate to be a bother. I saw her just this afternoon. - You had a nice chat, then? - You can bet they did. - Hello, Lebleu. - How are things, Roubaud? Fine, thanks. S?verine. - You're off already? - No, but I've got five minutes. Enough time for a kiss. - You haven't been out yet? - Not yet. Miss Dauvergne stopped by. We chatted a bit. How is it going? - Well, it's going, but not so great. I got into an argument. Some VIP might make trouble for me. - What kind of trouble? - Hard to say. Maybe you could talk to your godfather. Really? - Why? Does the thought scare you? - Not at all. You've often said how he used to terrify you when you were young. Terrify me? Don't exaggerate. All the other kids were scared of him, even his daughter. Whenever he'd show up, everyone would run away. But I'd stand my ground. He'd smile and pat me on the cheek. I always got what I wanted, and he never scolded me. Then perhaps you could ask him for a little favor. - Would it mean that much to you? - Yes. And that way we could visit Paris. You could do some shopping, and I'd meet you at Victoire's place. Fine. I'll talk to him. - How's it going, boys? - Lantier, did you get in on time? - Yeah, but I have an axle problem. - Rotten luck. - What train are you on? - The 112. - I'll see you boys later. - Bye now. See you later. ENGINEERS! INFORM THE DEPUTY STATIONMASTER UPON YOUR RETURN OF ANY MISFIRING OR POOR TIMING OF EQUIPMENT - Hello, Fred. - Hello, Lantier. I've got a problem with my axle. Can you take care of it? If it's burned out, you didn't give it enough oil. What do you mean? I spend lots on oil every month. But Lison is always so thirsty. - Who's Lison? - My locomotive. Well, you'll have to pay for the repairs. We'll see about that. So what should I do, go back to Paris? No point. Repairs will take 36 hours. Just stay here and rest up. Fine. There you go. You can let the fire go out. She'll be fixed day after tomorrow. Fine. Hello. - What's for lunch? - Sardines and cassoulet. Want some? No, that canned food rots the gut. Get a wife, my friend. I'm already married to Lison. She's good enough for me. That's right. I forgot. You're married to a locomotive. See you later, boys. It was an easy ride today. The wind was with us all the way. Saved a ton of coal and made ourselves some money. The axle's got you worried. Only 'cause it happened here. Back home I know all the mechanics. - They do good work here too. - I hope so. Philom?ne is going to be happy. That's right, your number two girl. Sauvagnat's sister. Just don't tell him that. He still thinks she's a nice girl. - And what will your wife do? - Victoire? Queen of the nice girls. Pass me a bit of your ham for my eggs. - Ham and eggs? - Yes. What are you doing tomorrow? First I'll check on the repairs. Then I'll stop by to see my godmother. Your godmother lives in Le Havre? No, not in Le Havre. Mrs. Misard is the guard at the crossing near Breaut?. She's always sitting out in her garden. Haven't you ever noticed? - What train are you on? - The 116. Why do you ask? Can you tell my wife we got a problem with an axle? We'll be heading back in two days' time. You know which one she is? Victoire. She's the lavatory attendant at the St. Lazare station. You can count on me. - How are things, Misard? - We don't see much of you around here. That's work for you. ls my godmother here? Yes, go on in. Will you be staying with us today? Yes. Feeling better? Jacques, it's you. It's so nice to see you. Is something the matter? No, things have never been better. Other than Lison breaking down on me. Good. Now you can get yourself some rest, and I can get a good look at you. You know I see you often, but you fly by so fast on the train that I can hardly recognize you. What about your attacks? You remember the ones you had here. The ones that had the doctor so mystified. I'm all better now. Your symptoms have all disappeared? Those pounding headaches and sudden fevers. The waves of despair that had you hiding like an animal in a hole. Things are better now. Much better. I'm glad. Seeing you ill doesn't do me any good. At your age you should be in good health. Flore's down by the river. Yes, I'll go find her. - You were watching me. - So? No law against that. We were only watching 'cause you're so pretty. I don't want people looking at me or thinking I'm pretty. I can't believe how you've changed. You're a big girl now. You've changed too. Now you look at me like the others do. I don't like that. - You gonna push me in the water too? - I will if you don't leave me alone. Jacques, what's the matter with you? - What got into you? - Oh, I don't know. I didn't even know what I was doing. Is that part of your illness? Yes. Did your mother tell you about it? - Yes. Yes, that's it. It's like this haze fills my head and twists everything out of shape. I start feeling like a mad dog. I never drink, mind you. Even a drop and I go crazy. I feel like I'm paying for all those fathers and grandfathers who drank. All those generations of drunkards who poisoned my blood and saddled me with this madness. It's a terrible thing. But I love you with all my heart. So much that I was afraid to come here. I love you too. I'd like to be your wife. I'd take that chance if you'd let me. Don't be silly. Don't be angry with me. What can I do? I think that me and women... Roubaud! How's S?verine? I hope she's not sick. - She's fine. She's gone shopping. - Good for her. Her mother liked a bit of shopping as well. I told her I'd meet her at your place as usual. - How's your husband? - Pecqueux's in Le Havre. Mechanical problems. Didn't you know? No. I can't keep up with it all. Of course not. Just stop by the lavatory and drop off the key. - Any message for your husband? - Oh, I'm not worried. He's got everything he needs in Le Havre. - See you soon. - Right. - Is my godfather here? - Yes, Mr. Grandmorin is in. I'll tell his secretary you're here. - It'll be nice to see him. - I'm sure he feels the same. - You've put up new curtains. I liked the old ones better. - I'll tell him you're here. Hello, S?verine. It's been such a long time. Is my godfather in? You know Mr. Grandmorin is always happy to see you. - Hello, Godfather. - Hello, S?verine. You've lost weight. It may be in style, but I'm not sure I approve. It's me. You probably thought I'd gotten lost. I had to run. The metro was simply impossible, and I didn't want to take a taxi, so I had to run all the way here. Look how hot I am! You don't expect me to believe you were shopping all this time. You horrible man. You know I love you. I got a little present for you. Say "a little present all for me." Come on. Say it. A little present all for me. What a fine-looking knife! Look, it's a Nogent. Let's eat. I'm starving. How did things go with Grandmorin? Everything's fine. He called one of his friends at the railroad. I forget who. Then he got in touch with Turlot. So everything's taken care of. That man has some pull. It's a good thing he's so fond of you. Yes, he is fond of me. He invited me out to the country. - His place in Joinville? - Yes. - When? - Today. - Did you say no? - Yes. - Why? - I didn't feel like it. Surely you don't want me doing things I dislike. You're hiding something. You act funny whenever Grandmorin's name comes up. Maybe you're scared people will think you're his daughter. - His daughter? - Your mother was a maid at the mansion. They all slept with him back then. We'd sure be in good if you were his daughter. His daughter. Could it be? Do I look like him? Calm down. I was only joking. Not here. We're not at home here. Let go of me! - What's the matter with you today? - You men are disgusting. That's all you think of. You're all the same. I should throw this ring he gave me out the window. What? Who gave it to you? Who? Grandmorin. - When? - Ages ago. On my 16th birthday. You've always said it was a keepsake from your mother. - Did I say that? - You made up a whole story about it. Why did you lie about your mother? - I never said it was my mother's. You were his mistress, weren't you? Tell me the truth, you slut! Let's hear it, goddamn you! It's true! Now let me go. You've made a real fool of me. An old man's cast-off. Did you plan to drive to Joinville? Were you going to take the train? The 6:20 for Le Havre? Our train. Come here. Sit down. Write this down: "Take the 6:20 train at St. Lazare. I'll meet you in your compartment." What are you going to do? You'll see. In fact, you're going to help me. That will bind us together. Now there'll be a solid bond between us. - Did you drop by for a look around? - Yeah. Hey, it's Lantier. - Cabuche, how are things? - Not bad. Did you see the Misards? - Yes. Where are you going? Le Havre. After a month in the old burg, it's time to see the city again. Have a good time. Hello. You know, this train's half empty. There's hardly any passengers during the week. Fine with me. I can sleep right through until Le Havre. Don't go! Come with me. He saw us. I'll have a word with him. Nice day. The heat was unbearable in Paris. Chief! - Did you see anything? - Nothing, Inspector. The train was almost empty. - And you, sir. You got on at Rouen? - Yes, sir. - And you slept the whole time? - Yes, sir. Where were you at the time, Lantier? - In the corridor. - Did you see anyone go by? Well, Inspector, I... I had something in my eye, so I wasn't paying attention. Grandmorin was killed? He sure had it coming. No more pretty girls for him! Lantier, what do you think? - About what? - About the murder. What do you want me to say? We can't lose sleep over it. I'm gonna eat and hit the sack. Good night. Did you have a good day? Yes. Do you know Mrs. Roubaud, the stationmaster's wife? S?verine? Is that her name? Her mother and my wife were friends. They worked together at the Grandmorin mansion. Why? Did you see her somewhere? She was on the train just now. An elegant woman. Well-educated. Not my type, but definitely pretty. Funny you should happen to mention Grandmorin. He was found dead on the train I just came in on. Stabbed to death. Sure, it was awful to take his money and watch. It's humiliating. But that's what will save us. They know people like us don't kill for money. What worries me is your letter. Ah, yes. My letter. It must still be on his desk. His secretary could have it. Then we'd be done for. He wouldn't dare show it to anyone. You're right. Too scared of scandal. What's going to happen to us? Our lives will go on like before. Grandmorin was just an accident. But I've taken care of the problem. It's nobody's concern but ours. What about Lantier? From what he told the inspector, he must not have seen us. I'm not so sure. Why don't you just burn the money? - What? It might be best. A wad like that? That would be a shame. I wouldn't dare spend it, but I won't throw it away either. What's on your mind? Lantier. There must be a way to win over a fellow like that. It's so nice out. Yes, it's lovely. Mr. Lantier, I'd like to bring up a delicate matter. What's that? The other night at the station you told the inspector you hadn't seen anyone in the corridor. Was that the truth? I saw you and your husband quite clearly. Why didn't you say anything? Because you asked me not to. I did? I didn't ask you anything. - Yes, you did. Maybe not with words, but with your eyes. So you think I'm guilty? Yes. You're wrong. I'm not guilty. I admit, things might have looked suspicious, but... I'll say no more, but it was just a coincidence, I swear. Just an unfortunate coincidence. Do you believe me? I'm not guilty. You won't hurt me, will you? Mrs. Roubaud, I was the only one who saw you. Rest easy. I won't tell a soul. I'm your friend. You can trust me completely. Let go of my hands. And stop looking at me like that. You'll hurt your eyes. So, then, if someone had gone down the corridor to get to Mr. Grandmorin, you would have seen him? Absolutely. But you didn't see anyone? That's right, Your Honor. Thank you, Mr. Lantier. Please send in Cabuche. Good-bye, gentlemen. - Did it go all right? - Yes. - What did they ask you? - The same as at the station. Where I was and if I'd seen anything. What did you say? I said I was in the corridor and didn't see anything. Did you know Mr. Grandmorin? Yes, Your Honor. Perhaps too well. A girl named Louisette worked for him as a maid. This Louisette was your mistress. No, damn it! That's a vicious lie, Your Honor! She wasn't my mistress! You're a violent man. You served five years in prison for killing a man in a fight. He hit me first. Besides, it wasn't five years. They let me out in four. So you claim this Louisette was not your mistress. Your Honor, you have to understand, she was a little girl when I got out. You know, the whole village despised me. They could have stoned me. But she would smile and say hello. She was so nice, Your Honor. So we got to be good friends. In the summer we'd pick strawberries together. In the fall we'd go looking for chestnuts. Sometimes we'd walk through the forest hand in hand. It was wonderful, Your Honor. But nothing ever happened. It could have happened, but it never did. I mean, she was growing up, and I really liked her. And she liked me too. But she went away to work for Grandmorin. Then one night, she showed up at my door. I had a cabin in the woods. Your Honor, she was so distraught that she was shivering with fever. She didn't want to go back to her parents. She just wanted to die in my arms. I should've killed the bastard right then and there! Grandmorin's life was beyond reproach. Is the arrest warrant ready? Roubaud, this long wait is frustrating. It sure is. It's a good thing most of the witnesses are passengers. At least they don't work on the line. - It's better that way. - Indeed. I think they're questioning a fellow named Cabuche right now. We know no one could have come from the other end of the train. And you're the only one with a grievance against Mr. Grandmorin. Admit it: You killed him. I'm telling you, it wasn't me. You're really starting to annoy me! I say you killed him. Take him away. It wasn't me! Let me go! Your Honor! It wasn't me! This Cabuche business is bothering me. I know the guy. I'd be surprised if he did it. If he went to jail, I'd have to do something, 'cause he's not guilty. Mrs. Roubaud, is that you in this picture? Yes, when I was a little girl, with my godfather. Mr. Grandmorin was your godfather? Yes. What a sorry affair. My wife still hasn't gotten over it. You really should visit more often. You'd have some nice home cooking for a change, and it would do us some good as well. You're very kind. Good-bye. - Good-bye, Lantier. - Mrs. Roubaud. "Mrs. Roubaud." How formal! I'll get the door. Good-bye, S?verine. Good-bye, Jacques. Sorry about the lipstick. What kind of delivery? Your wife asked my sister for some embroidery. What sort of fool do you take me for? Embroidery! What's this nonsense? Darling, it's true. I asked Henriette Dauvergne for it. I'll show you embroidery! I'm not stupid. I know why he's here. Get the hell out of here! Mrs. Roubaud, I'm so sorry. If only I'd known. He better not come back or I'll take care of him! These young bucks expect a married woman to be a pushover and the husband to look the other way. It makes my blood boil. if that ever happened, I'd wring her neck. Roubaud, please calm down. I'm sorry. How stupid of me. I know you'd have sent him packing. Lantier, I wasn't including you in that bunch. Come, let's have another drink. No, thank you. I have to go. Good-bye. Good-bye, Lantier. Please don't be angry with me. If I get violent, it's because I love you. Give me a kiss. - Never again, you hear? Whenever I look up at your face, it makes me afraid. I see you back in the train. What you told Lantier was right. I haven't gotten over it. I'll never get over it. I can't forget it either. But if we don't, life will become unbearable for the two of us, here in this place. I'm going out. Where? The caf?. I'm meeting Cauche and the others. If they're going to the caf?, why shouldn't I? Please forgive me, S?verine. What was the matter with Roubaud? Oh, he's just been a little jumpy lately. He's not hurting you, is he? I don't think you should stay here. Why not come with me? I love you. - You love me? - Yes. I've loved you for some time now. Why don't you come with me? - You love me? - Yes. - This is terrible. - What do you mean? - You mustn't. - Why not? - You mustn't. - But why not? I'm incapable of loving anyone. Are you saying you could never love me? Jacques, I love you as much as I'm able to love anyone. Don't be angry. My life hasn't been a happy one. My childhood was so horrible. I'm still afraid sometimes. It's not a lover I need but a good friend who I could talk to about my troubles, my disappointments, my hopes. I need trust and tenderness, and I can give them in return. But not love. You mustn't ask for that. I understand, S?verine. Perhaps it's better this way. I could tell you a few things as well. It's better this way. We'll just be good friends. Lison is such a funny name for a train. You can't call someone you love by a number. - May I get on? - You'll get all dirty. - Who cares? - Wait. Careful. There's oil and coal everywhere. - It's so hot up here. - Well, it burns a lot of coal. - It all looks so complicated. - You get used to it. She's a nice one, huh? She just might be the best locomotive on these tracks. So you're in love with a locomotive. We've been through so much. Really? Yes. On the line we see it all. - Even when you're flying by? - Of course. You get to watch the changing seasons. The leaves uncurling in the spring and drifting to the ground in autumn. The rabbits in the fields with their little ears sticking up. They watch us go by. They know we'd never harm them. That's funny. When I travel, I never notice a thing. Perhaps you don't know how to look. My hands are all black now. Let me see them again. No, I must go home. Will you come back again, S?verine? Yes, Jacques. I'm sorry. I'll have to pay you tomorrow. - Your luck wasn't so good. - No, it wasn't. - Good night, Roubaud. - Good night, Cauche. - So you got yourself a partridge? - Just before the storm. They were flying low. This one stuck to the front of the train. - The train was still moving? - Sure was. I had to jump for it! I know everyone does it, but that's crazy. What do you mean, crazy? Don't you like partridge? No, it doesn't agree with me. Just the other day Lison hit a cow. Right, Lantier? - Did you bring back some beef? - Hardly. We sent it flying 30 feet. If we'd run over it, we would have derailed. Dead cow is not a pretty sight. Aren't you gonna eat? No, help yourself to what's in my lunch box. Don't mind if I do. - Got yourself a date? - Yes. - Think she'll show? - Maybe. Women like that are like cats. They don't like getting their feet wet. What do you know about "women like that"? Oh, I can guess. I'm suspicious of women who have no children. What about Philom?ne and Victoire? You haven't gotten them pregnant yet. It'll happen one day. I love kids. I've got loads of them. One's in high school in Le Havre. He's been accepted at the university. Good for the university. - Were you expecting me? - Yes. I love you, Jacques. So you do love me? There's something I have to tell you. - No, don't say a word. - Good night, Roubaud. - Good night. - You're heading home late. - So are you. I'm working. That's different. - Good night, then. - Good night. - Thief. - What do you care? You don't have to touch it. It's none of your business. I don't understand you. You used to be an honest man. When things go bad at home, you find other interests. Since you don't love me anymore... - You're right, I don't. Then get off my back. Do I judge you or get in your way? Perhaps your boyfriend would like a watch. Just don't let him flash it around or he'll end up in jail. - Thief! You make me sick. - Don't you want to split it with me? - Thief! - Aren't we in this together? Grandmorin will be our lifelong bond. Even if you run off with Lantier, one day you'll come crawling back. How sweet. You're so thoughtful. - I thought you might be hungry. - I'm starving. - Shall I get us some chicken? No, stay here with me. Wine from Malaga! If I could, I'd run away with you. What's keeping you here? Darling, you have no idea. Yes, I do. It was Roubaud who killed Grandmorin. It all started right here in this room. All because of a ring Grandmorin gave me. Grandmorin? If you only knew how Roubaud treated me. He knocked me down and dragged me around by my hair, and then he beat me. At one point he had his heel right in my face, ready to smash it in. I'll never forget it as long as I live. He's just a jealous monster. Do you still love me now... ow that you know that? Of course. Your past is your business. You made the decision to marry Roubaud. But the fact that you were that old man's mistress... That's a little strange. I've never loved anyone but you. If only you knew what the others were like. Wait a minute. What about the old man? Roubaud killed him. Yes, I know, but didn't you help him? No, but I saw it all. You did? It happened in a tunnel. The noise was just awful. My blood still runs cold at the thought. But tell me... how did he kill him? With a knife I gave him. A knife? How many times did he stab him? Just once. What was it like to see him stabbed to death? I don't know. Why are you lying to me? Come on, tell me the truth. It was awful. That one minute was more intense than all the rest of my life combined. What's wrong? Nothing. You had me scared. Love me, darling... because only your love can help me forget. I love you with all my heart. Don't be scared. I need your love too. Is something wrong? Tell me. It's all in my head. Waves of grief. I get so miserable I can't even speak. If my husband were out of the way, we could put our troubles behind us. But we can't just kill him. Yesterday he almost got crushed between two train cars. I was so close to being free. One morning you're fine, and by the evening you're dead. - Were you getting worried? - No, I knew you'd come. He'll be here. He came upstairs. I saw him take his gun. He'll be making his rounds. Come with me. Some thieves broke in last night. They stole some lead piping. Over there. He'll show up. I just know it. What was that? I thought I heard someone call out. No, it was just one of the cars. They're moving a train. Somebody's moving around in that car. No, it's just rats. This place is full of them. There he is. Where? I don't see him. He's coming around the shed. He's coming toward us. I see his shadow on the wall. - Is he alone? - Yes. I can't do it. I can't do it. Put my hammer in the smoke box. CONCERT AND DANCE NATIONAL RAILROAD BALLROOM So it's all over? You won't be seeing her again? Everything has to end sooner or later. You had some good times together. Love is best early on, before you know each other well, when you're both on your best behavior. Take me, for example. I don't care for dancing, but she does. So I take her out because I'm a nice guy. I guess I owe it to her. Her brother caught us in bed the other night. I barely had time to jump out the window in my shirt. Then he slapped her around. Does that make sense to you? Not to me. She's his sister, not his wife. What's it to him anyway? The poor kid. Look at Roubaud's wife. She looks just like a princess. Not bad for the wife of a stationmaster. Is something going on between you two? You mean Dauvergne? No, not yet. Today he kissed me on the hand, but not on the lips. - Is he in love with you? - Yes. I even wondered what it would be like to love him back. To start anew. A better life. Maybe not happier, but at least more peaceful. I'm being honest with you, and I know you believe me. Why lie to each other now? There's no way forward for us now. We can't go any further. Tomorrow will be just like yesterday: the same grief and sorrow. It doesn't really matter. What happens, happens. All I can do is go on living my miserable life until Roubaud kills me. Because one of these days he will. I can tell by the look in his eyes. Leave him. Come live with me. Killing you won't make him happy. He said he'd find me, and I believe him. Only death can break the ties that bind me to him. Shall we dance? - Then I'll be going. - Why? There are others to dance with. Like Dauvergne. Tonight I only want to dance with you. Good night, Jacques. Will you dance with her? I always step on their toes, and they get mad. What's the matter? ls something wrong? Yes, something's wrong. Good night. We should have stayed like we were in the beginning, when we loved each other but didn't pursue it. You remember those innocent walks we used to take? They helped me forget about Grandmorin. When you've experienced all the disgusting things I knew as a young girl, it's madness to hope for a true love of your own. No, you'll forget the past and we'll be happy. Every night I dream we're together, far away. I go to work. We have a little home together. Every evening you're waiting for me at the door, and I take you in my arms and hold you tight. We love each other like no two people ever have before. They'll leave us alone, and we'll put the past behind us. They'll know you did it. You'll go to jail. I'll never see you again. No, it'll look like a suicide. He's been acting so strange lately, it won't surprise anyone that he'd shoot himself. There he is now. Yes, it's him. Come. Kiss me. With all your heart and soul. What's the matter, Jacques? Why me, Jacques? Let's go. - I thought you didn't like dancing. - Don't you like it here? You're the one who wanted to come. Besides, Lantier might be back. We can at least wait five minutes. This is a little story About Ninette's little heart She offers it to everyone But never gives it away That's a pity for anyone Who tries to win her heart Whoever tries to love Ninette Will end up with a broken heart Ninon's little heart Is tiny and frail and adorable Like a little butterfly Ninon's little heart Is tender and sweet If the poor lass flirts a bit and won't behave It's no fault Of Ninon's little heart Where the hell can he be? He's never been late in all the time we've worked together. Who? - Lantier. - Who's Lantier? Jacques Lantier. From the Batignolles depot. Don't you know him? Are you okay? Didn't you sleep well? - I'm fine. - I did your job. Here are your overalls. Hurry, we've only got two minutes. Let me see your waybill. 520 tons. Didn't you get any sleep? So you saw her again? So you're still seeing each other? Pecqueux, I have to tell you something. Don't say a word and don't move. I killed her. That's right. I killed her. It's all over. I'll never see her again. It'll be the death of me, I know it. I couldn't bear to hold her anymore. I loved her, you know. I loved her little hands most of all. But there's one thing I don't get: Why haven't they arrested me? If I were in your shoes, I'd turn myself in. I'd tell them everything that happened. They'd understand. I do. I can't go on! Listen, Lantier! Poor guy. How he must have suffered to come to this. I haven't seen him look so peaceful in a long time. We need to clear the tracks. Take the train to the next station. I'll stay here with him.
