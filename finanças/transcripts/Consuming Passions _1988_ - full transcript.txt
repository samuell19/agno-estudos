WELL, THAT IS A SHAME. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LET YOU GO, IAN. NO JOB. NO COMPANY CAR. NO REFERENCES. 50 YEARS ON THE DOLE. HAVE YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND, IAN?

WOULD'VE THOUGHT A SENIOR EXECUTIVE COULD'VE DONE HIMSELF A BIT BETTER THAN THIS. I MAY NOT BE HEAD OF SPECIAL PROJECTS MUCH LONGER. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PROMOTE YOU AGAIN. NO, THEY'RE NOT GONNA PROMOTE ME. FELICITY, WOULD YOU STILL LOVE ME IF I GOT THE SACK? WELL, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO, ARE YOU? YOU GOT A SMASHING JOB. YOU'RE A GREAT SUCCESS. BUT IF I LOST MY JOB, WOULD YOU STILL LOVE ME IF I WAS A TRAMP? OH, YEAH, I WOULD. I'D COME AND BE A TRAMP WITH YOU. I WOULD, HONEST. I'D LOVE TO SLEEP IN BARNS AND ROLL ABOUT IN THE HAY WITH YOU. WE'D BOTH BE DEAD SMELLY, AND WE'D BOTH HAVE THESE GREAT LONG BEARDS-LIKE AND HATS WITH HOLES IN THEM. OH...FELICITY. EH, IAN, DO YOU RECKON THIS BED WOULD BE ANY SOFTER IF WE, LIKE, LAY DOWN IN IT?
