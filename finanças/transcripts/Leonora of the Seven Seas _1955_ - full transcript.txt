LEONORA OF THE SEVEN SEAS Any similarities between the characters in this film and any real person, living or dead, is a coincidence. Hello? Listen, the boat just came in. - Get ready, I'm going to look for her. - No, doctor! Ana María, what's with you? I'm scared. You promised me yesterday that... Yes, but I can't! I'd go crazy! I... Then our discussion was worthless? When the moment arrives I'll be fine. But come quickly, for the love of God. I can't see him alone. That's fine. I'm coming. Honeymoon in Rio, huh? Fan-tas-tic. Pablo Valdés? Always closed off. Always closed off. Juliana, for God's sake. I want to know what happened today. It seems like the end of the world. For you too, Juliana? Me too? Why? She called? No one called. - Why are you stalling? - I went to three pharmacies looking for the pills. - Ricardo says I'm cured. - And you're not. Yes, so cured that you always have to have the pills with you. One step at a time. - Whose fault is that? - Mine? Are you scared I'll try to kill myself again? - You shouldn't talk like that. - I'm not like that because I don't want to be! - You think I don't notice this prison? - The doors are open. The doors are open because you know I don't have the courage to leave this house. But the day I'm brave enough... The day I... - Leonora! - Leonora's dead. - I'd have to care about her a lot, right? - Ana María! Care about what? Even your tenderness wanted to steal me. A person's always a child. You remember the dumb questions I'd ask you? "Who lives in the stars, Juliana?" You'd respond... It's mine, it's mine! It's mine! What are you trying to hide? We're in the same hotel. See you later. DISCOVERY OF AMERICA IN ART Any calls? I'm most nervous about finding myself with other people. Talk! Ask questions! - You should have kept him from coming. - Kept him? How? The main thing now is to stay calm. Think before you speak. This is too much for me. It would have been easier to have just gone to the port with him. You know how nervous I get at the port. - Your place was there, waiting for him! - But I couldn't. You know I couldn't. I never saw him. Not even a photo. Everyone who stepped off the boat would have been an agony for me. I'm sure that I would never have forgotten the horror down there. He should have called by now. The noise of the water. The hordes of tourists and dock workers. People talking about the marvels of Sugarloaf Mountain. Ships arriving... women crying... children that leave... immigrants, handkerchiefs, faces... The boat horn. That damned boat horn that drives everyone mad! Hello... It's me. Laura. How are you? Fine... thanks. Nothing new. - If I can get away in a bit, I'll head down there. - ¡No! Ana María, what's wrong? You don't want me to? I... I... I'm leaving. Where are you going? What's with you, Ana María? Nothing, Laura. Nothing's wrong with me! Nothing! Why are you acting like this? She's one of the few friends you haven't pushed away. Laura doesn't know everything? No. She doesn't know who's coming. I knew this would happen! Ana María! I never thought he would come here. Everything was so far away... The port, the sea, an enormous distance between them. And to think that at every moment... Ricardo, what will he be like up close? You want him to forget. But how can you think of anything else, when everything reminds you of Leonora? Stolen! She always had stolen things. Kleptomania. You give strange names to the desire to steal. That's it. The same name you're saying. Kleptomania: Mania, disease. - Everything is now a disease. - But it is. Ricardo. There must also be emotional kleptomaniacs. They take over someone's feelings, stealing part of someone's soul. There are people that must keep all those other souls. All stolen! Kleptomania. Paris. Without leaving here, I know the rest of the world better than Leonora. When she got back from Paris, she loved champagne. For her, Paris was cheap champagne. She only talked about that, while I agreed to hold onto the memories of her trips. Bahia. So much music, so much mystery. so many churches filled with light. And she just saw the drums from the macumba ceremonies. You think he'll come straight here? I'm so nervous. - How are you, doctor? - Fine, thanks. Imagine that the dress isn't finished. That one I copied from a French magazine, a Christian Dior. - How are you, Ana María? - Laura... - No, don't tell me anything. I already saw that it's a private matter. Am I seeing this, or am I not seeing it? It would be funny to have secrets with me. I can't help but notice that your voice was strange on the phone. - it concerned me. DId something happen? - Nothing. Well look, I got worried and came down here. This girl isn't very... you remember the pills? Laura! And you think I don't believe that anything happened, seeing you with those faces? - What's going on? - The same as always. Being mysterious, huh? And I thought you were like family. Why did you disconnect the phone? Laura, you're smart enough to understand. I am, but spare your psychologizing for someone else. - And you don't have to throw me out. I'm going. - It's not like that, Laura. - We were just... - Doctor, I'll spare you the trouble of making excuses. I saw, I got it, and I'm leaving. Juliana, what happened? - I don't know, miss. - What is this? With me, Juliana? Being coy with me? - Is there a letter? - Yes ma'am, returned. Couldn't find the addressee. Addressee unknown. Returned to sender. Why don't you open it? Who is it from? From me. From you? Let me see. Let me see! And you had the nerve to tell him that? I needed to tell him everything. I couldn't lie any more! You couldn't lie to him, but you could to me? So he wouldn't come, don't you see? Who would have thought he would come... after hearing that Leonora had died? You could have at least told me! Don't you see how humiliating this letter is for me? What need did I have to tell Gilberto? He was far away. I didn't have secrets. For me... - he was barely a city on a map. - And me? Was I also a city on a map? A city on a map is barely a black dot, Ana María. That black dot represents the lives of millions of people. You can't live your whole life in a fantasy world. You've got to start confronting reality. And you're the one telling me? Face reality. What reality? Don't you yourself say you feel regret when you cure the insane, bringing them back to reality, to the daily life everyone has? What reality? Are you the one who finds poetry in Leonora's stolen things? What reality? Everyone sees the world... with the eyes he has. But they don't realize it! No one really knew Leonora. Even he flew her to Buenos Aires. Then she left, and his letters began to arrive. She got her strength from other souls, with the same ease that one steals from the stores on the Gran Vía in Madrid, - or in La Florida in Buenos Aires. - She was always innocent. Innocent? Do you remember my last dance? I felt happier than ever before. I was dancing with Gilberto, away from the world, away from everything. It's Leonora. Leonora, this is Gilberto. You have the same smile. Mother's smile. Look, I got a check. - The maestro decided in the end. - She thought only she loved my music. We can celebrate now. I think we'll be... very happy. Then she began to smile, in that smile that men interpret... as a strange mystery of innocence and purity. Then the music cut off... The music and all of life. Hello? Yes. It's the hospital, doctor. Dr. Fernández asked me to tell you he has found space in the clinic. Very good. Thank you. Forgive us for not going to the port, but they told us the wrong time. I'm Ricardo. Pleased to meet you. I don't mean to be a bother... but you understand my anxiety, right? Of course. Ana María... The same look. Leonora told me so much about this house. I'm so impatient to see the things she left behind, that I didn't even see the city. I just thought of arriving. Ana María will show you around. Unfortunately, I have to... Don't bother about me. I don't want to cause any disturbance. Excuse me, please. There's so much I don't understand... that... that I haven't been able to calm myself down. I didn't come earlier because it was impossible. People think they can know one another in the maze of the city, and after they leave... forever. This causes so many questions, so many doubts. I knew the agitated Leonora. But I know there was another one: the Leonora of her letters. This must have changed quite a bit, after she... It did. You know, this first impression is strange. But I can't imagine Leonora inside of this house. Everything seems so calm here. So... While she was full of nerves and emotions. Come. This is the box? London, Paris, Rome. Leonora never rooted herself anywhere. She needed to feel emotions and see far-off places. Did you ever go with her? Never. Since I didn't see her die, I had the impression that she left, again, on one of those crazy trips of hers. She was anxious for new scenery. But even so, in her letters, she dreamed about a home... our home. We had it all planned out, you know? Even a daughter. A girl... with braids. My books, my piano, a big armchair... The paintings. Yes. This house became so real. If I close my eyes I can see every corner and thing inside. The garden, the girl running through the house... Silvia. Silvia? Was that the name she gave her? Yes. Now you see why I couldn't help but come? Without you, I would have spent the rest of my life... unaware of my daughter's name. And who is this? Leonora. Leonora? She changed her hair color. It barely looks like her. What photo could possibly reproduce... those eyes that reflected so many seas? The letters... She kept my letters. So many plans, so many dreams... And to think that I'm here, without Leonora. She spoke so often of this city, and wanted to show it to me. Some places had a special meaning for her, like that little bar near the beach. She crossed the water in a small canoe and spoke with those humble people, fishermen and boatmen. I don't know if I'll have the courage to go alone, to see the nighfall without Leonora. The waves breaking, The Christ and the sea. Now I can only piece together what she left behind. A word... an object... and try to put the other Leonora together with them. What most struck me was how much she focused on your happiness. On my happi...? She even told me about Gilberto. Yes. Thank you for everything. You didn't need anything else? Nothing else. I'll come find you tomorrow. I don't know if I'll have the courage to go alone, to see the night fall without her... The Christ with his open arms. I have the sense that Leonora once again left, on one of those crazy trips she would take. She was like a bird that couldn't be caged. Some places held... a special meaning for her. Like that small bar near the beach. Do you want one? - Sorry? - A crab. Le-o-no-ra. Do you know her? It's been a while since she's come here. She only bought from me. And she let me put coins in. Coins? In the juke box. She liked it. She always wanted the same music. Do you want to hear? Consejeira, you have another customer for your music. There's a man outside who knows the lady. That one, remember? The man is a friend of...? - Yes. - I haven't seen her for a while. What a shame! She helped so many people around here... Casira! The owner. - The gentleman knows Leonora. - You don't say? Such a nice girl. I was going to ask her to be godmother to my son, but Leonora doesn't come by anymore. The last time she was here, we were worried about her. She came with some strange people. Where is she? Is she outside? - No. - She's sick? - She died. - It's impossible! Virgin of Corbao! Was it long ago? Months. Strange things, right? How time flies. It feels like she was here just yesterday... watching the sea... hearing the music in the distance. Life isn't worth a dime! Months, you say? It seems like a lie. There's no reason to be so nervous, my dear. The man isn't made of gold. I know. What will he do to her? It's not my fault for being so observant. That's a new hairstyle. Laura... Well, it's nothing to get worked up over. - And did he come back? - He? - Who? - Who do you think? That man. The one who came to this house. - Not yet. - Who is he? A friend of Ricardo. Are you looking, Juliana? Little secrets. - Who is it, Ana María? - No one. - Oh, no one! - Will he wait? - Who? - No one. - I asked if he would wait. - It's not your business. - Sure, it's not yours either. It's so much not your business you spent all last night awake. I know I'm nosy, but if I had gone on with Leonora... - Laura! . It's fine. I'll stop talking. I didn't understand anything, but I stopped. Well, if this isn't a private meeting, I could stay... a bit longer. Oh, I see. It's private. Ok, since you're here... excuse me. Ana María can be certain I'll never enter this house again. You can't do that. Please. You're ready? Ready? Didn't I say I'd come get you? I want to take flowers to Leonora's grave. With me? Who better than you, Ana María. But I... I'm not going. Not going? What do you mean? Never? Never. Why? I don't know. Please... I would have liked so much for you to go with me. Ana María, what were her last words? The last ones? What did Leonora say when she died? I don't know. - I don't remember. - What do you mean? Didn't she die here? - Yes. - And you weren't by her side? I was. Then why do you hide what she said? She... was delirious. Delirious? Ana María, how did it happen? - How did what happen? - How did she die? But I already wrote you! I told you everything! You wrote about a heart condition. How did Leonora never tell me about it? Who was her doctor? Her doctor? But why all these questions? - I don't know! I don't remember! - But you have to remember! But didn't I already explain everything? You think what you said explained anything? I spent months not understanding. - Not understanding what? - Anything! That's why I came! - You mean... I lied? - Maybe with good intentions. But I don't need that type of lie! If I came, it was to find out the truth! Instead of the truth... I find you crazy with fear. Your letter... There was something strange. Your words... were unclear. The letter seemed to say: "Don't come... we're finally free of her." Ana María, how did Leonora die? But don't you understand that I need to know? She's always in front of my face, with her innocent and pure smile. I hear her voice talking about our home. Our lives, our dreams. It's impossible, Ana María! It's impossible that all that has disappeared! Leonora's feelings, her tenderness, her dreams... Why do you laugh? Why are you laughing? Leonora's feelings... - her tenderness... - Ana María... Then you're like the rest! Don't you see that she never felt anything? Her letters... her dreams! Her dreams were the lovers she had in every port, to be forgotten at the next stop! "For men she was a wounded bird." Didn't you say that? "Her smile was innocent and pure." A kleptomaniac. A thief! She was just a thief! How can you hate her? She cared about my happiness... didn't you say that? That she cared about my happiness, from when she was a child? How she'd scare me, how she'd cut my braids off, how she stole my parents from me! She would do the worst things, because they always forgave her vices, giving them pretty names. She would fix everything with her hypocritical smile. But I had to deal with all of her problems! They never forgave me for anything. Yes... She was worried about my happiness, Pablo, until the very end. It was only a week before my wedding, when I found out the truth. But I didn't want to believe it. But that day... that day when I followed her to the port,... I wanted to kill myself. I wanted to end it all. When I regained my senses, Ricardo was in front of me trying to save me, and suffering more than me. I learned all of that after, because I spent months out of my mind, not recognizing anyone. Scared of everything and everyone! Leonora stole Gilberto from me, like stealing an ashtray from a hotel. No, Pablo, the Leonora I knew... didn't have the reflection of the sea in her eyes, or of dreams, or feelings. You've come trying to find Leonora here, because you can't find her anywhere... not even in your own memory. Afterwards I didn't have faith in anyone or anything. It was when I started to read his letters to Leonora. I learned that, despite everything, there are also people like you in the world. Ana María... How did Leonora die? But... How did she die? You want to know? Leonora killed herself. She killed herself, Pablo! Leonora killed herself! Leonora. Why did you keep it from me? Why did you lie to me? - How did she do it, Ana María? - Leave it alone! I told you everything! Let it go, for the love of God! How did she kill herself? Forget it! But... - Please understand. - Understand what? Her resentment? Her lies? Her desire to change Leonora? If you were a doctor, you've give Ana Maria's words their due. She lives in a dreamworld. I've done everything I can to make her face reality. So she understands that Leonora just needed... to be given direction. Maybe the troubled life of Leonora was caused by this disquiet. This anguish at not finding her way. In the end, death is the end of all paths. Who could see her collapse coming? Collapse? She had heart problems. - The last treatment... - She had treatments? - With whom? - With me. Of course, I'm not a heart specialist, but I've had some medical experience, and... in any case, her last EKG was worrisome to me. it was normal. But that's understandable nowadays. A normal EKG doesn't mean there can't be a problem with the heart. Do you have a record of her problems? Of course. Could I see the file, - and her EKG? - Of course. But I've explained to the nurse so many times not to do that. She tends to shred the records of patients who pass away. Dr. Ricardo, how did Leonora die? It was her heart. You say it was her heart, and Ana María just told me that she committed suicide. I'll find out the truth, doctor. You can be certain that I'll find out what you did with Leonora. Everything! It's me. What was all that about suicide? It was all I could do, Ricardo. I didn't have any more answers. But didn't we agree? At least I could have been warned. It's ok. Takee a sedative, and relax. That patient left very worked up. - What's wrong with him? Should I make a file? - No. I'll make it. - Are you leaving, doctor? - An emergency. - But the waiting room is full... Reschedule them. If there's a problem, contact Dr. Fernández. Good bye. SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA conductor GILBERTO CONDE I already told you everything I know over the phone. Not everything, maestro. You didn't explain what happened to Leonora. But don't you see how absurd your persistence is? I didn't see her again, after... that day. Not even when she died? Died? Don't you see I need to know everything? You only know part of the story, but not right now. I'm need at the rehearsal. Then... - when? - I don't know. After the concert? After the concert... I travel to São Paulo. Maestro. I put down the 22nd for the concert. - We'll include your symphony in the third part. - No, in the second. That's fine. Good bye. Congratulations. - I'm leaving. - Wait! I know this tune. It was Leonora's song. Yours, maestro? And you say this woman meant nothing in your life? But don't you see what she meant to me? She was definitely an extraordinary woman... despite everything. Despite what? You didn't see her after she left you? Leonora never left me. I left Leonora. I don't know what she means to you, but for me she was just a moment of insanity. The worst thing is that I can't forget. It's not easy to forget Leonora. It's not Leonora that I try to forget... You still don't understand? I looked for Ana María, but it was too late. I don't understand your anguish or your doubt. Leonora's violent death shouldn't surprise anyone. She's dead? So then you lied. I didn't tell you? Strange. Maybe I didn't because I thought you would give it up in some way... In what way, maestro? In the end, what do you want from me? Let's begin! Let's go! Come on! Figure it out! I don't know anything! The gentleman should understand. This ins't the proper section, and besides, I'm not authorized to say anything. - But you have to understand... - I understand. But things have to run through our superiors. But you don't understand, I can't wait. This is an urgent matter. I know. It will be looked into. And if I'm the one asking for the information? How much problem is there in giving me information from a file... of...? I shouldn't, you understand? But given your credentials, and given that what's in the file is nothing new, already mentioned in the papers... Yes? Here it says she's a thief. Yes, kleptomania. Klepto-what? Here? Stealing. It's plainly stealing. If you go to the police... they look at it calmly, maybe giving... - a scientific name for it. - And regarding my complaint, what are the measures you are going to take? Not us, you understand? The proper section. It follows the usual procedures. The gentleman will be called in two days... One moment. Number 32. I'm calling Cobiano. Cobiano? Yes. Could you look at file 22-28-97? Yes, 97. I'll wait. The gentleman is from Argentina, correct? Yes. "My dear Buenos Aires..." Gardel, right? And the football, how's it going? River Plate, Boca Juniors, San Lorenzo de Almagro... Yes? Yes. Right away. Yes. Fine. Unless there's an error or omission, according to case 22-28-97, this woman... is alive. I know nothing, sir. Ask Dr. Ricardo. Do you still receive news from Leonora? - Yes, from Leonora! - Sometimes... asking for money. - And where is it sent? - Who brings these requests? - The mail. But why don't you go in and ask? Where does this woman live? What woman? Ana María's friend. Across the street. On the 3rd floor. Sir... Oh my, everything so messy here... Please come in. Pardon the trouble, just a couple of questions. - It's about Leonora. - Leonora? I already know everything. Everything? - I know she's alive. - What? Someone told you she wasn't? That's really strange. The lady ignored this? But of course. How could you imagine that they could say something similarly absurd. Now I can explain the mysteries of Ana María, and why she was so startled yesterday. But sit down. Did you know Leonora? Did I know Leonora? Before she went crazy about traveling, we were friends. She changed a lot after, you see? She was ungrateful to me. I felt so embarrassed for her so often... just like her, right? The police came around a few times about that thing... hidden in the attic. Once she showed me. The funny thing was that she didn't feel the slightest bit of guilt. She thought it was normal. Just looking, sir. She and Ana María only seemed like sisters in the face, in fact they are step-sisters. - Ana María is from the second marriage, but... - And where is Leonora? - You're asking me? - Yes. Where is she? The last I heard, she was with some guy... Federico, but that was long ago. It would be best to find the guy who sold her weed. - What "weed"? - You don't know? It started out extravagantly, it seemed to me. She bought a pack of cigarettes, threw them all away, and put others in that she had in her bag. Several days later she had me go into a store and talk with a strange person, who would give me a pack of foreign cigarettes. It seemed strange, you see? But I went. She waited outside. Suddenly the police showed up, and almost arrested me. Me there like an angel, innocent, innocent. You know what that pack had? Macoña! "Macoña"? What is that? You roll it in cigarettes, something like... opium. A person smokes it and becomes wild. It's a drug, you get it? - Marijuana? - Should be. After that day I didn't hang out with Leonora any more. Just imagine, man, macoña! Do you have any "maco"? I do. Come in. But don't come around here again. You stick out, and the dealers won't trust you. - How much do you want? - 20 of the best. - Did you bring...? - No, Mr. Calunga. - I spent a month in Canaguas, in recovery - You have the guts to show up here? Get lost! Just this once, Mr. Calunga. Hook me up just once. - No more of this whimpering. - I'll pay what I owe. I already paid, the girl's waiting for me in Yaque de Pawa. I... - We're going to stop this crying, you see? - I'm going to get my hands on that cretin. Beat it! I promise I'll pay, Mr. Calunga. Didn't I bring you lots of clients? Just this once, Mr. Calunga. You don't keep things quiet very well, you know? You didn't do your part, Calunga. If this goes on, I'll... Don't come to me with talk to frighten sparrows! Just tough guy talk, right? I've been admitted 22 times into the toxic wards. Gone in and out! Once more, once less... Is that ok? Don't sell any more to that woman. - What woman? - You know well who I mean, Calunga. If she pays 200 for the weed, - I'll give you 500 to not sell it. - And then... she'll look for another friend. - "El Mato" is over there giving out "sopa". - That's my business. Don't sell to her! - That face is getting more intense. - That's enough! - This face... - I'm talking! Ok? I'll pick up the thread. That other time the guy slipped me some money, and I took it to mean he wanted me to sell some weed. I sold it. Now he wants the opposite, to pay me not to sell it... - What's her name? - You know it, Calunga. The name doesn't interest me. It's a deal. Leave two big ones for expenses. But be sure of one thing, Calunga,... - if you don't follow through... - That face... - Shut it! Who let this guy in? No one. Say the wrong thing, you'll know you're in the wrong place. The weed's hidden and this is almost... a family reunion. - I already said that this place is too known. - They rang the bell for Jorgito, for sure. - Cut down when he started to talk. - How did this guy get here? Who gave him the information? Didn't I tell you I'd find out everything? I know she's alive. If I were you, Pablo... I'd go back home. I wouldn't follow this to the end. - What do you have to do with those people? - Careful with what you say! "Those people." Where do you think you are? I just want some information. Information? About someone you know. Maybe I do know her, maybe I don't. - Ok? - A woman named... Leonora. And how should I know who that is? - She used to look for you. - Women don't look for me, boy, I look for them when I want them. That's how it works! - He's trouble, for sure. - I'm talking! Around here, boy, no one knows about anyone else. Don't stir things up. I don't want trouble here. Where is Leonora? - She bought from you! - Bought! - What did she buy? - Macoña! Macoña? I've heard of that, it's marijuana. It's in her diary. - Talk! - Calm down! That woman doesn't come around here now. She buys from someone else. And watch your manners, boy. Here on the corner accidents can happen. You understand? Don't keep on with this, Pablo. It's best to get back before it's dark. This money is so Calunga doesn't sell Macoña... to the woman you're looking for. And if you need to know, Leonora... is my wife. I couldn't sing in front of her husband, you understand, boy? But for two bills like these, I can say what I want. I'll accept outside money too. It's a deal. 2000 is enough. The last time i saw her, she lived with a guy named... Federico, but that was a while ago That guy liked the easy life. Disgusting guy. Even people like us didn't like his morals. The guy lives in a hotel in Laranjeira. Who is it? Let me in. Please. Excuse me. I need to talk to you very badly. Who sent you? Come in. Don't mind the mess, but yesterday... Please, I'm sorry about the bother, but... I need your help. It's very important to me. It's 207. Two coffees. One moment. Would you like a coffee? No, thank you. Hey, two boiled eggs as well. In two minutes. In two minutes. I came to ask you about someone you know. Who? Leonora. Leonora? What Leonora? I'm certain you knew her. Oh, yes, her. That's right, yes. I called her Norita, Leonorita, yes.. - And? - Where could I find her? Norita? I have no idea. You mean you don't know where to find a woman who lived with you? But why should I, friend? If I knew where every woman I had... Please. Come in. - Excuse me. - Don't worry about it, old man. A guy gets really upset when... Women! You want a drink? No, thank you. Manicure for 207. Look, old man, a woman is like a cheap sandal: you use it, and then you throw it away. The last time I heard from this Norita, she was singing in some low-class cabaret. A cabaret called... with some French name. "Rosa" something or other... Oh, yes: "Rose Rouge." How can I talk to that girl? That door, sir. But you'll have to wait until after 2. No, it's that... I was looking for... that song. Doesn't another woman sing? Oh, I see. Norita sings this music every night. But on Fridays you can't count on her. "Hey, daddy," Fridays she goes down to Cabo Club. She's in the Cacumba section in the Paitero ranch. Hey, I've been robbed! Leave me alone! I didn't steal anything! Don't be scared. It's me, Leonora. Pablo. Pablo? Pablo! No! Leonora, what did they do to you? I looked all over for you. I couldn't forget you, Leonora. I needed to see you. I want to know everything. I want to see you! See you! No! No! Now do you get it? It scared you because you saw in her... the marks that life had left, on her face and her soul. I see in her the face and soul she would have had... if life hadn't touched her. I'd hate for you to go back without knowing. When you said you were coming, I asked them to say Leonora had died. I didn't have the strength for more humiliation. It seems so incredible, so monstrous, that... - Leonora... - Which one? Mine? Yours? Ana María's? We each see with our own eyes. It's easy to judge someone else. It's hard to understand them. Understand the threads that control their puppet bodies. And you forgive her. A woman who had everything: a husband like you, a home, friends... She didn't need anything. A judge condemned her. I'm a doctor. You don't condemn someone dying of cancer. You treat them. Leonora's tumor is in her soul. I took her in several times... I didn't love her like you see her, but like I dreamed that she was. We are much more in what we dream, than what we are in reality. When do you leave? Less than two hours. Good bye. Yes? There's no reason to lie. Pablo already saw Leonora. He needs to know the whole truth. That what he loved were the letters you wrote. Your letters, Ana María. It's you, and not Leonora that he's looking for. He's suffered enough. She shouldn't destroy your life too. At least... save yourself from all this. It's your last chance, Ana María. Good bye. He already told me. It was her... and it couldn't be her. The most painful thing is that right now, you can't even feel a pain as large as my disgust. And her face... that face marked by such terrible things. Why didn't you tell me the truth. Ana María? Why? I wrote, but you had already left. Here's your letter. It was returned. And to think, there was a time... when a letter from Leonora saved me. I was desperate. How could she find the words? "You can't imagine how precious life is, Pablo? What an extraordinary miracle life is. Miracles in the simplest of things. A smile is a miracle. A glance is a miracle. A word is a miracle." The hand that caresses is a miracle. Now I'm ready to go back. Go back right away and forget everything. When does your boat leave? At 11. Within the hour. Now I understand the sanctity of those lies. If I hadn't come, I would still think she was dead... as I loved her. I would have memories, nostalgia. But now, what meaning is there in life for me? What meaning? Every meaning in the world, Pablo. You can't let her destroy that too! You have your whole life ahead of you, waiting for you. You will forget. Yes, you'll forget, Pablo. One day you'll find the partner you deserve, and who deserves you. One day you'll find her. You'll have a house, your home. Your wife, your children, your music... and if you listen to it together, remember all of those people who still live without anyone, without music. Love is ignoring, swallowed in impossible dreams. You'll find her one day, Pablo, and you'll love her so much... so much... Good bye, Ana María. But you can't until I... The boat is leaving. If I could just go with you to the dock. If I had the strength to go out, walk around among people... No one can keep you from coming. Everything, Pablo. To go back and find her again in these streets, the nightmare of Leonora. To justify all of her actions, and give all of her cruelty. Good bye, Ana María. I... Good bye, Pablo. All visitors are advised that the boat will depart in less than half an hour. Why did you let him go? You told him everything? When does he leave? Now. Last notice. We ask all visitors to disembark. Addressee unknown. Return to sender. And if he never reads it? Maybe that's for the best. And if despite knowing everything, Pablo feels nothing for me? But you can't stay locked away here forever. She will continue destroying your life. You have to face the truth, Ana María. You have to go to the port. No! - You know I can't. - You have to go to the port! No! It would drive me crazy! That mess of tourists and shippers, that's behind the people... Strange faces. Women who cry, children who leave. Waving handkerchiefs... And that damned siren that makes everyone go crazy! And seeing him depart... even though he knows that I'm the Leonora from the letters, that those feelings are mine. Leonora's feelings, Leonora's tenderness, Leonora's dreams. And I love him so much, Juliana. So much... Hello? No. I'm coming, Pablo! I'm coming!
