Once upon a time, in a certain place, To be precise, on the outskirts of the village. where we lived. There was an old building. called "Argentine Ruins". A certain woman was living there. A somewhat weird woman. Originally from Argentina. In the past, she used to teach tango and Spanish here. But now she's stopped. Since then Her mind has become a little strange. Engaging in some peculiar religion. Or collecting cat skins using spells and selling them. Anyway, there are strange rumors going around. So the people of our village call her, "Ah, Argentine Baba." They were calling her that. Hurry and run away. Argentine Grandma is no longer here. I thought she was dead. She probably won't die though... Ten years later, Cousin Shinuchi... became a high school student who couldn't help it. Hey, hey, over here, over here, over here. Hold on, wait. Ouch! I am Wakui Mitsuko. I've become a high school student facing a really tough situation. Dad. Let's go. Okay. Mitsuko, Go there by yourself. Dad, today... mom. What's wrong, Wakui? Please call the doctor. Please call Dr. Shomura to Room 502... Yes, hello. Mitsuko, why? Huh? What are you saying? Wait. Like that... I'll go right away. - Inhale (吸引- sucking in)! - Yes. F102, check vital signs. Yes. Let's do another section. Excuse me. Blood pressure is 60/42. Then prepare catecholamine. Yes, understood. Yes. - Prepare for heart rate. - Yes. What is my brother doing at times like this? Mom suddenly disappeared right before my eyes. In her student days, she was a swimmer, and she had stronger stamina and health than anyone in the family. My mom, like that... And my dad... Since mom was hospitalized, he went to the hospital without fail every day. But on that day... No, from that day on... [Argentine Baba (Old lady)] Original: Yoshimoto Banana Wakui Satoru - Yakusho Koji Mitsuko Wakui as Maki Horikita. Takimoto Sanae - Morishita Aiko Takimoto Shinichi - Kobayashi Yukiichi Wakui Ryoko - Tezuka Satomi Yuri - Kyoka Suzuki. Director and Screenwriter - Nagao Naoki Is Dad missing? Oh, no, is he not here? Well, let me explain briefly. First, the basic "Sayonara (Goodbye)" plan: Coffins, storage, and cremation are all included in this fee. Next, you can choose the format of the funeral. For example, Oh, did you come to receive a massage? Today is already over, but... Ah! I'm still an apprentice, but if that's okay with you... It looks luxurious. Is there some kind of gathering? Like a prayer meeting in Bouldang? Happy birthday. Oh, whose birthday is it? It's my mother's... Congratulations. Well, your mother's birthday is also, in a way, your own birthday. If your mother wasn't born, you wouldn't have been either. That's a big deal. I just came out to make a delivery real quick. I shouldn't have taken a shortcut. Miss, please go inside as a favor. I don't want to, it's too hot. What if someone finds out about this? Ugh, this is unbearable. Hey, over there! [Wakui Timber Shop] goodbye. Thank you for your hard work. Mukai, I'll handle it. Mitsuko, you're being kind to Mukai. Yes, it's the Rebirth massage shop. Yes, I'm coming, but... What? Is it dad? Uh, so, what happened? I was the first one to find it, me! Ohoho~ How cute. At a time like this... Oh, is this also for delivery? Doesn't matter. Hey, kid, go away. Ask the grandma for some snacks. There's something here. What do you mean, something? That mansion, there are strange rumors about it. Stop it now. We're in the middle of investigating. It's hot. So... What is it? Saturo is healthy! Kou! I'm sorry, could you give me a glass of water, please? Water? Actually... Ah! But what about Mitsuko? First, we need to confirm what's going on. As you said, actually... There's a bit of a difficult situation. For Mitsuko... We must be cautious in how we deliver this news. What? Why? Why are you like that, Shirai? No, I thought it was something to celebrate, so I called Rebirth Association just now and told Mitsuko. You did what? This is a big problem! Oh, really! Ugh, this is unbearable. Ouch! It hurts! Wait, don't follow me! Aah! Me... Me... Excuse me... Um... Excuse me... Are you, by any chance, Mitsuko? It was tough, right? Because your mother passed away... You were truly an excellent kid. It was tough, right? I wanted to hug you whenever we met. About your mother's... It was tough, right? It was like lonely, right? It was sad, right? ah! Dolphin! Wow! Ah, I envy it. If only I could swim so freely, I'd feel amazing. I could even participate in the Olympics for sure. Mom... Hey, Mitsuko! It's not "hey." You've been here the whole time? Huh? Yeah. At least keep in touch. What were you doing here? What do you mean, what was I doing? don't you have anything to say? Do you know about "Mandala," Mitsuko? Mandala? The universe isn't flat, and time doesn't exist. Really? Instead, it's all stacked in layers, countless layers. Countless layers? Yeah, yeah, yeah, like a mechanical box. So, all these different times and other things are interconnected in some way with the whole. Inside... It's eternally repeating. I tried to express that somehow, by thinking it might be Mandala. What are you talking about? (As the translator, I'm also curious;;) Look at this. My Mandala. At its core, it holds the center of the entire universe. The image is complete now. From now on, I plan to complete it thoroughly in various places. From now on? Yes, from now on, yes. The warmth of the sun. The energy of lavender. You... honey. Today, too, please supply me with life. Mitsuko, are you okay now? Both of you, have a cup of tea. Here, please enjoy it. "Macha," the tea of the country where I was born. I didn't like it much when I was young, but now, it's indispensable to me. Even honey that I personally weaved is filled to the brim. Huh? Did you catch me? I secretly put poison in it. Eating it will be tormenting and painful~ Ah~ I'm happy. Welcome, dear guest. I'm Yuri, call me Yuri. I feel like I'll become friends with Mitsuko. Whenever you feel like having this tea, feel free to come by. Right? Yes, yes. I'll also teach you how to make honey. I taught it to your dad too. Right? Yes, yes, that's right ^^ Honey is like medicine. It's a nourishment for life, so it keeps you healthy. Here, please have some. Don't worry about it. You don't want it? I do. I'm sorry. I... I'll leave now. What the heck, what's Mandala, don't joke around. Mitsuko, give me that. No, I don't want to. It's been months, why is he leaving his daughter alone for half a year? If you won't eat it, just give it to me. I said I don't want to! Mitsuko, are you okay? You've been waiting this whole time. You even put beer in the fridge. Give it to me. I said I don't want to! St-Stop, don't hit the table! Die! Don't say you'll die so easily! He'll come back. Dad will definitely be back. Right now, I think he's taking care of Mom. He's probably making something like Mandala. He's probably making something like Mandala. So I guess he'll be back soon It's okay. For sure. He'll come back. Is Mitsuko angry? She must be. Naturally. In the beginning, you... Both your face and body were so damaged, It seemed as if you were a ghost. You didn't seem like a person living in this world. What, does it matter? You've become quite handsome now that you've recovered. Your legs have improved too, it feels like you've returned to this world. That's something It's something that makes me and Mitsuko very happy, isn't it? Isn't it? Yes. That's right. Yeah. That's right. So, it's okay. I hate the idea of being in a place with such a strange woman. I absolutely hate the fact that you're there. You became the laughingstock of the village. Do you think it's okay to just leave it like that? Do you really think Uncle will come back? What are you talking about? If I bring back Uncle, what will you do? what do you want to say? Can he come back? Yeah? Don't worry, Mitsuko. Aunt will do something, so just wait for good news. I'll contact you tomorrow. "I'll contact you tomorrow," so check your phone properly. I want to show you this... I took the nursing school entrance exam. I want to study properly... I'll help someone as much as I hurt you. This won't heal your leg, but... Shinichi.. Take a break for a moment? In a place like this? By any chance... are you Shinichi and Sanae? Regarding Yuri... It's been famous among children for a long time. Being able to enter this ancient ruin... no, this mansion... There... I'm truly honored. I'm really... happy. These days, many people come here, and it makes me... happy~ Now, please eat. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Huh? Uncle, weren't you a Buddhist? Yeah? Ah, there was a time like that. But now, it's changed. Really? Amen. Amen. Amen... Amen... Now, let's eat. Oh, Uncle, you don't even bathe properly, but somehow you're popular from the old days. If I want to be popular like you, what should I do? Be handsome like me and have a profound understanding of the mysteries of the universe. This is the mystery of the universe, right? Mandala? I know this much. You're amazing, Shinichi. Then, do you know about 'Daeil Yeorae'? Usually, at the center of a mandala... There's usually "Daeil Yeolrae" in it. But mine is different. Who do you think is in it? You probably didn't know. Like Jesus Christ or something. No, it's not. It's Yuri (Argentina granny). Yuri is in it. How should I tell Mitsuko... If I do that, he won't come back for real. Why? Uncle seemed somehow happy. He looked happy? How so? Well... he's living okay and maybe it's the end of a man's dream. Huh, the end of a dream... The end of a dream, huh? What are you really talking about, Shinichi? Where and how is it the end of a dream? Even Mandala wasn't like an offering to Aunt. What do you think? In the center, Yuri is there. Oh my goodness! Don't make fun of me! He didn't even come to the funeral, and the ashes are still here. Instead, he's going crazy with some other woman, and on top of that, she's the kind of woman Mitsuko was abandoned for! Think about it from Mitsuko's perspective! What are you in the end? You came with gifts, and you even lowered your head to her! That... gifts? Oh this? Where is it? Yeah? Oh... Is this honey? This one. Wait... Miss Mizu - beer! beer. Shall we go back now? Dad might be sleeping already. Ah, by the way, sometimes he shows his face too. You used to be her husband after all. Hey, is there still beer? W- Mitsuko! Did you overhear our conversation? As expected, the promise is invalid. Shall we go to the shop? So, what have you been up to? You've been dependent on us for half a year, so you have to give something back. We're going to get it back! Dad! what? this time, Never I won't back down. Love is... Passion. Dance is... Passion. With dance... Energy... We draw out that passion. And convey that passion... To the other person... Kindly... Passionately... Come on, Mitsuko! Riding a bike won't show your strength. You can't beat Grannny. Honey... What's wrong all of a sudden? Really. Should I go with you? No need. It's okay. And if you enjoy love, the aftertaste fades away, but the love remains. Hold onto it properly. Is that okay? You lack perseverance. Yeah, what did you say? I mean, you lack perseverance! Hey, wait... Mitsuko, waah! It's dangerous! Mr. Wakui. Are you okay? Stay strong a bit more. Yes. This can't go on like this. If we leave it alone, it might become an uncontrollable situation. What should we do? That's why I say that mansion is a truly extraordinary mansion, you know. It's not child's play. There's no need to force her to come here. I never expected this situation to happen... As I thought... Is it 'that'? Mr. Wakui is a master craftsman. He carves everything with care, but now, the gravestones are mass-produced from Chinese stones. After that, they just carve the names with a machine like 'c' shaped. It's a time when everything feels empty inside... And at a time like that, It's like a hollow feeling in his heart... Isn't that right? During such times, his wife... Isn't that right? But still, he'll make a gravestone for Satoru Not just a 'C'-shaped one, but handmade. Is that so? It's a tough job! For my brother, making gravestones is better than having three meals a day, right? So, if I make another tombstone here, He'll definitely come back to his senses, definitely come back. He'll come back, he'll come back for sure in the meantime. I see, you plan to use Shirai's death to make me an Amitabha (Buddhist term for the deceased), don't you? no.. He will come back, for sure. Come on~ Yeah, okay. Come on~ Step, step, step, step. It's dangerous. Brother. Ugh, it's painful. This place is really historic (Argentine baba's building). I'll leave the stone here. It's granite. I asked the labor union president and barely managed to bring this here. With this, make a gravestone for my sister. It's for enshrining! In a temple! Hey! Satoru! Are you there? Make sure you create a gravestone for your wife! Hey Satoru! Mr Wakui! Brother? Brother? Satoru! are you listening? I brought a good stone. come out! It's granite. Brother used to talk about it often, Saying, "The deity residing in the stone tells me to carve, keep telling me." So, brother can't just leave this granite behind. I'll leave it here for you to eat. I'm sorry... Then, I'll go. Father, by now (he should be) carving (the granite), don't worry. But Dad doesn't know Mom's command. I'll be back. Uh, uh, surprise! Hahaha- Oh, you startled me. what's the matter? Gibbs Did you go to the hospital? Ah, yeah, yeah. Since you went to the hospital, you must be doing this. Does it hurt? Hey. Go home, go home now. It's getting dark. When Dad return, I'll go too. Yeah, got it. Miss Mitsuko! Ms. Mitsuko It's Dad. He ran away. He couldn't accept Mom's death, still scared, so scared. But you know, Please wait. That person... Someday, he'll overcome it. He will overcome. So let's wait together, Mitsuko. I, too, couldn't accept my family's death. one morning, soldiers suddenly came to our house and gunshots echoed everywhere. It felt like a bad dream. No matter how much time passed, I couldn't accept it. so, I was scared, so scared, and I ran away, like your dad. But now, it's okay. I'm living quite peacefully. Your dad will also have such a time. So, let's wait. Mitsuko... Sorry... You're not good at this, so let me do it. Don't make fun of me! You do that side! I'll... I'll draw here, I'll draw here. This... This belongs to me! That's enough! I drew it better. Hey, look, what I drew... Ouch! it hurts... You little... How irritating.. Ugh! Be quiet! Ow! These brats... So annoying! Watch out! You brat! I'll never forget! I'll remember for sure! I'll be sure to remember! Please, let me finish this!!!! Ouch... Mitsuko? Mitsuko! Mitsuko? Mitsuko? Mitsuko-! Mitsuko! What is this? Mitsuko! I won't forgive you! I won't forgive you anymore! What's going on? What's with this momentum? You said you made a decision. They are demanding accountability! What did you say? I'll never forgive that man! Put him in quickly. Sure. Alright! Operation start! Yes! Mitsuko! Mitsuko-! brother!! What's wrong? hey!! Ah! I don't like it, don't like it, don't like it, don't like it! fire! fire! fire! Oh no, what should we do! Stand back! Out! Out! Out! Out! Do not panic! Don't panic, don't panic! Those little brats! water! bring water! It's dangerous! It's burning, let's go! That man is angry. Water! Water! Water! It's not inside! Yuri, it's enough now. I won't go out! Wait, please. Pray to God. Great! Great, great, great! Great, great, great! The best, the best! It's out, Yuri! It's out! Those little brats! Ahaha, you scared me! Don't make fun of me. It's your fault! It's all because of you, all of it! Tell me, what's your purpose? Sanae... Money? Do you want to marry my brother? Sanae! Tell me quickly! Stop it! Yuri didn't do anything wrong. I want to be here! I fell for her. I fell in love! No matter what anyone says, Brother, calm down and let's go back to the way it was! Mitsuko, you say something too! It's you who's hurting the most! Um... well... It's strange. To be honest, mean, I didn't really hate it. You, who comes back after wandering around, Dad anyone dating without hesitation, and having something like a trendy shop. You do things your own way, which is also your character, and it's like... a feeling of 'freedom,' so it's not that bad. But why can't you forgive Yuri or Uncle? It's strange, just let it go! Yuri, what's wrong? Yuri? Hey, are you okay? Shinichi, give her some water! sit down. What's wrong, are you okay? Are you okay? A little... Yuri.. are you okay? This part is the head. Look at this. And... it's moving, this is the arm. This is the leg. Ah - it's moving healthily. Approximately 4cm in height. Four months pregnant... Four months pregnant? Yes. But, doctor at her age? Well... that's true, but... Yuri... What can I say... You see... Uh, I'm okay. I'll give birth to this child. This baby is already alive, right? Yes, I... I'll raise it. That's impossible. With your current condition, it's impossible. As someone who couldn't properly be Mitsuko's father, you can't be the parent of the new life that will soon be born. You should first become Mitsuko's father. I will be the mother of this child. I will save this child. I will save this child's future. Even if it means I die. So, you see... Go back home now, and stop running away. Your life is not just for yourself. Yeah. Mitsuko? Ah, is it a baby? I don't want it, I don't want to rely on a baby. I've already forgotten how to bathe a baby. Don't worry, there won't be scenes like that with you. But, you know, what you said on the rooftop earlier... Huh? What was that? No, can't do it. Stubborn. I'm just being stubborn. Mitsuko? Huh? She hasn't come back yet. That's strange, where did Mitsuko go? Mitsuko? Mitsuko? Yeah? Hey, look. Look, that, that thing is gone? What do you mean by "that thing"? Look at it. "No! Gone? (The jar that holds bone ashes.) The jar I had on the altar is gone! A jar thief? Are you kidding? What on earth happened? I have a hunch, Mitsuko might be involved... So, don't worry... A hunch, you say... Anyway, what is he making? That, I think it's a gravestone for Ryoko... A gravestone, you say... Yeah, yeah, thanks for your hard work. Yes, thank you every time. Ah, right, by the way... Then, with this... okay- Yes, yes, 10,000 yen. It's been about three weeks now, hasn't it? Seems like it. Really? brother.. ..I'll tell you. From 2 PM today... There will be a watermelon smashing contest. At the 'Water's Edge' restaurant by the sea... Excuse me. Mitsuko. Yes? oh! Good, this was the right place after all. I thought you'll be here. We used to come here often, the three of us with mom. I was bad. No... It was me - I was bad, yeah. I was bad? Don't just say it so lightly! It's not 'I was bad'! You don't even understand people's feelings! As parents - Parents should prevent their children from feeling this miserable! But But dad... Ran away. It wasn't just running away! Ending up like that in a place like that... But Mitsuko, She helped me. She helped me. Already to the point of not knowing what's what, In a state of " Ah, am I going to die like this?", I met Yuri, Hm, With an Argentine baba. Yuri taught me the tango, "It's not about the form, It's about dancing with your heart," she said. She also taught me how to make honey, Depending on how you raise the bees, the taste of the honey changes, What can I say... It was quite fascinating. "Is that so?" "I'm still-" "I thought I felt something fun," I thought i were alive," And during that time, Yuri became pregnant, at that age, Even though she heard it was risky from the doctor, she said she wanted to give birth. She wouldn't listen to the doctor's advice, Even though she might die herself, She's strong, Yuri is. But Dad, I'm a coward, always running away, I really has no dignity. Your Mom said to me, "Make it for me," "Make my gravestone for me," she said. I couldn't do it, If I made something like that, Your Mom would really die. If I made a gravestone-like thing, your Mom would truly be gone. so I was afraid and couldn't do it. I ran away. But now I understand, Mom is gone now, Mom has died. Now I know, Now... I know. me.. At that time, I thought it was time, Bleeding from her nose, Unable to breathe, in pain, In a small way. Seeing Mother become so dirty, I thought it was time, I wished for her to die quickly, I thought that way. And then, Mom... Really passed away... I.. I killed her. Now it's okay, Mitsuko, Now it's okay. This year too... I wanted to come here with you Next year, the year after that, And even after that, Continuing to come here. Let's start again, Let's start. Ah, Mitsuko, Do you want to see your mother's tombstone? I made a beautiful one, Mom really liked dolphins, A rectangular gravestone would be boring, really.. Dad... Yeah! Should we show Mom the dolphins again? Sure. Honey, we're here again, To see the dolphins, It's the same sea, like back then, Yeah, the same sea. Hey Mitsuko! Over there! Ah! Dolphins! Dolphins! Dolphins! Dolphins! Wow, amazing~ Oh, be careful! Mom, Honey, Goodbye. Goodbye. Mom's gravestone... Wow, it's like an underwater ruin! Mitsuko, go by yourself. - Huh? - l'll just smoke a cigarette and be right back. Right? Smoke one cigarette. Oh, my. Touch it. But.. Is it dangerous? It's okay. But, from now on... I think I might get closer to that Miss. Yuri, I feel like we'll have a lot of fun times together, That's how I feel, So... You're saying such kind words, I should do something in return... I promise to make Mitsuko's healthy younger sibling for sure. Why are you like this? Are you in pain? I'm so happy. It's strange. Mitsuko's touch reaches every corner of my body. Yuri. yes? next time, Teach me how to make honey too, just like you did. Sure. At that moment - I heard Yuri's heartbeat. As if... the sound of waves washing over me, Completely opposite. I mean, I thought that person would completely destroy Mitsuko and his dad, But it's completely opposite. Months later, let's pray. As promised, Yuri gave me the best gift of a younger brother. The remaining of us embraced the faith... However, her condition worsened after childbirth, And she also suffered from heart disease... In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Yuri... Be careful, your neck! Hug me, to this grandmother too... Sure, I'll leave it to you. So adorable. We want a baby too. It's bothersome to make a baby, You're mean, Mom. Then, let's celebrate Mukai's future - Cheers! My part-time job is still ongoing. Mukai has entered a school in Tokyo Tokyo to get a massage therapist license. Close, close, that's right, that's right, that's right, we get along well~ Mitsuko, get closer, don't be shy, that's right. Let's go. Ready, "Ma~ssage!" Yes, that night, We didn't talk about what we saw on the staircase at the revival party until the end. Once I graduate from school, I plan to study baking techniques seriously. Then, as a skilled baker, I will gather experience, And soon, I'll remodel a part of Dad's workshop and plan to open a bakery in the town. Mandala, Dad's unfinished creation, has now become a place loved by my younger brother. Dad. Yes. Oh, do you know what people in the village say about Uncle? Of course, they must talk about the Argentine grandfather. What? How did you know? Hey, here, take this, take this. I don't want it. Why does it matter? Just take it. I don't want it. It's okay... why are you snatching it away? I told you not to laugh, didn't I? You're such a tease... There's something Yuri's words often come to my mind. Hey, Mitsuko. Yes? Do you know why people love each other? "Why?" Because they want to leave their own past behind? There might be reasons like that, but more than anything, Time, please don't flow away, I wish this moment could last forever, forever- Please, Please, don't end, I hope it continues on forever. It's a futile wish. but, you know, If you were to see It from above the sky, for sure, Like a sparkling necklace, Even a beautiful shining pearl that even God would be attracted to. Sparkling...? Sparkling. Could it become like that, for me... It's okay. Someday, it will definitely happen. The time will come. Yeah. They'll be properly watching us from above the sky. Really? Yuri... Mom.. -thank you-
