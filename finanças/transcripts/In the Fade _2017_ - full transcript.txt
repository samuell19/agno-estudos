(GROANS) (DOORBELL CHIMES) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) Mrs. Şekerci, I have sad news. The victims are your husband and son. (SOBBING) (CRYING) Mrs. Şekerci? Chief Inspector Reetz. I'm leading the investigation. My sincere condolences. (SNIFFLES) Do you feel able to help with the investigation? Can't this wait till tomorrow? (SNIFFLES) It's OK, Mom. Was your husband religious? Excuse me? Was he a Muslim? My husband is agnostic. Was he Kurdish? I'm Kurdish! Why do you ask that? Was he politically active? Did he raise money for any groups? No, my husband wasn't politically active. Did he have enemies? (SIGHS) What kind of enemies? A bomb was set off in front of his office. What? We have to assume he was the target. Where did you last see your husband and son? This afternoon. I dropped Rocco... at his office. Did you notice anything? No. Wait, a woman left her bike out front. I told her to lock it up. It was new, with a top case on the luggage rack. Like on a motorcycle, you know? Could you help create a composite sketch and look through our picture database? I want to see my loved ones. They're no longer people. Only body parts, Mrs. Şekerci. (SHUDDERED BREATHS) BIRGIT: Shh. Do you think they suffered? BIRGIT: I'm sure they didn't feel a thing. Imagine Rocco lying on the ground, seeing his own limbs around him. Imagine how scared he was. They didn't feel a thing, Katja. - They died immediately. - (CRYING) What are they saying? "The nail bomb attack killed convicted drug dealer..." Motherfuckers. "... Nuri S., 37, and his son Rocco, six. An Islamist or political motive has been ruled out." Let me see. BOMB EXPLOSION ON SHOPPING STREET! POLICE ARE SEARCHING FOR THIS PERSON THOUGHT TO HAVE PLANTED THE BOMB. SHE IS PROBABLY EASTERN EUROPEAN. WOMAN: He was mixed up in something. Like what, Mom? You should know. Maybe he was keeping something from you. Don't ever say that about my husband. DANILO FAVA, LAWYER - Katja? - Yes. (DOOR BUZZES) Can I get you a drink? Was Nuri still dealing? He'd stopped that. Was it about protection money? Nuri could've handled that. Was he involved in anything? Anything you know of? He wouldn't have put you guys at risk. So, who did it? They're looking for an Eastern European. She was German. As German as me. Nazis did it. Who else would've had a motive? Did you tell that to the cops? Do you have anything here? Sure. What do you need? Whatever. Katja, please. They were gifts from clients. I'd only throw them away. Thanks. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) We want to take our son and grandson with us to Turkey. So, they're close to us. We're going back for good. He's my grandson, too! Excuse me. (SNIFFING) Ah. I've lost my family. And you want to take them away again. You can't. I won't let you. (SNIFFLES) (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) Good. Well done. Shit. It's alright, it's alright... (SIGHS) This one's for Nuri. (SIGHS) Thanks for coming. You know, if you'd taken better care, my grandson would still be alive. My condolences. (LIGHTER CLICKS) (DOORBELL CHIMING) (KNOCKING) REETZ: Katja, can you come here? Good morning, Mrs. Şekerci. Developments in the investigation mean we must search the property. What developments? This warrant permits us to search your house. Mr. Hartung from the district authority is here to observe. Hello. Please stay with your visitors. MAN: Stay where you are! Would you please fill this out? MAN: Gerrit, could you come here? I found this. - That's all? - Yeah. Keep searching. - Her husband's drugs. - Mom, stop. - Katja! - Stay out of this. They're mine. Please step into the kitchen. Just briefly. Can we have a minute? Do you have more? Possession of narcotics violates Section 29. You may remain silent. But I do need you to come to the station. To answer a few questions. Contact my lawyer. Don't worry, Mrs. Şekerci. It's such a small quantity, there's no chance of prosecution. Surely you want to know who murdered your family. Without your help, we won't find the killers. Any idea who might've done it? Nazis did it. How so? His office is in a Turkish neighborhood. Were there ever racist incidents there? Like a pig's head in front of the mosque? Not that I know of. Would you like some? How did you meet your husband? I bought grass from him as a student. What did you study? German studies and art history. Did you graduate? I dropped out. Why? Your husband studied business in prison, then opened his office. Mm-hm. He was a tax advisor and translator. And he sold flights to Turkey. Do you know how much he earned? I did the bookkeeping. Do you have any other work? I was a mother. You have a big house. Wasn't it expensive? It's out of town and has poor public transport. Your husband's annual income was 50,000 euros. How could he afford a 70,000 euro deposit on the house? How do you know that? From his tax documents. Some of the files survived. The money was from my father-in-law. A loan. Where did he get so much money? He owns land in southeast Turkey. Does he grow anything? Like cotton? Houses. He grows houses. You want me to incriminate my husband and confirm your theory. What theory? That he was still dealing drugs! For months, the drugs unit has been surveilling suspects. Some repeatedly called your husband. Can you explain that? My husband interpreted for offenders. He had to speak to them. It was his job! - KATJA: Why are you investigating my husband? - REETZ: We're not investigating him. He didn't murder anyone! He was murdered! We have to assume that your husband maintained his links to the criminal world. We believe he engaged in criminal activities with the murderers. Maybe there was a disagreement, and your son and husband were victims of revenge. So, who did it? The Turkish mafia. Or the Kurdish one. Maybe the Albanians. We'd hoped you could help us. (REPORTER TALKING OVER TV) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) KATJA: Can I have a beer, Michi? Sure thing. Why did you do that? What? Say they were your drugs. Because it's true, Mom. You're getting yourself in trouble! What did your husband turn you into? What did you say? Annemarie, let's pack. Thanks, Michi. Fuck off! Take care, Katja. (DOOR CLOSES) (SHUDDERED BREATHS) (KNOCK ON DOOR) (DOOR OPENS) Want some tea? Pregnancy tea? Should I leave you alone for a few days? Yes. I can't leave you like this. But I want to be alone. I'm always here for you, OK? Call me any time. (CRYING) (GUITAR RIFF PLAYING) (MUSIC STOPS) (PHONE RINGING) (MACHINE CLICKS) (BEEP) Hi Katja, it's Danilo. I tried your cell.

(BEEPING) And now... it should work. (MOTOR WHIRRING) NURI: You're the best! Who's the best? Look, I'm boring now. He's over me. He's over us. JUSTICE - Good morning, Mrs. Möller. - Good morning. Are you ready? Good. My colleague will handcuff you. Roll up your sleeve, please. (DOOR SHUTS) (DOOR OPENS) (CHAIRS SQUEAKING) Good morning. Please be seated. I hereby open the trial of Edda Möller and André Möller. I note the presence of the defendants, their defense attorneys, the public prosecutor, the approved joint plaintiffs, and their attorneys. Excuse me, your Honor. I have an urgent request. I hereby move that witness Şekerci be removed from the courtroom. Thank you. Mrs. Şekerci has a right to be present as co-plaintiff. Attorney, allow the prosecutor to read the charges first. Please remove Mrs. Şekerci. Thank you. I will not. Then I formally request a court decision. Mrs. Şekerci is a key prosecution witness. Thank you. His Honor and the prosecutor have overwhelming evidence at their disposal. She must leave. If she stays, she will be privy to all the evidence and other testimonies before she testifies. She will of course adapt her own testimony accordingly. The witness will be worthless. I therefore request that witness Şekerci be removed from the courtroom. Thank you. My client appreciates the attorney's concern regarding her testimony's value. She will nonetheless exercise her right to be present as co-plaintiff. I reject your motion, attorney. Then I request an immediate decision by the entire court. Thank you. Very well. I hereby suspend the proceedings. Please remain seated. What's going on? He's trying to disrupt procedure, hoping the judge falters. - It's all he has. - I'm staying. I hereby announce our decision. As a co-plaintiff, Katja Şekerci is entitled to be present at the trial. We can now hear the charges. Prosecutor, go ahead. "On October 20, 2016, Hamburg, André and Edda Möller are accused of having acted in concert, on malicious and base grounds, to murder two people and maliciously attempt to murder an indefinite number of others by knowingly, intentionally and collaboratively conspiring to plant a pre-prepared "nail bomb" made from fertilizer, diesel and 500 nails, and, by detonating it, to murder or injure as many foreign residents as possible..." Stay home tomorrow. Why? It might be too rough. See you tomorrow. They're rotting in there. The first danger is the shock wave caused by the blast. The child suffered inhalation trauma in the upper respiratory tract, and also barotrauma with acute distention and peripheral bleeding in both lungs. The second danger is debris and shrapnel. The child had a gaping 3 cm wound in the central upper abdomen caused by a jagged metal fragment that was still embedded. It also pierced the eighth vertebra. The resulting wound ripped the small and large intestines. It also tore the liver and totally severed the abdominal artery. The torso sustained over 14 small, round and linear wounds with nails up to 10 cm long embedded at various depths. The third danger is the immense heat. The center of the explosion briefly reaches up to 1,000 °C. There were extensive burns to the front of the body, head, face, torso, arms and thighs. The hair was burnt to the scalp at the front of the skull. The eyes also sustained burns and had totally melted. The right forearm was roughly severed at the elbow joint. The limb was found 6 m from the body. - I can't take anymore. - You want out? One moment. Yes, Mr. Fava? - I request a short break. - A break of five minutes. Look at me, you cunt! Stop that at once! I'll kill you! (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Two more shots. Not for me. You don't want another? I'm driving my son to kindergarten tomorrow. You gave Möller a good smack. Imagine if they'd gotten me and Rocco. If Nuri had survived. He wouldn't have stood for all the chit-chat. I changed my mind. One more. Mrs. Şekerci, I can well understand your emotional reaction, your outrage. But this court deals only in facts. Should there be another incident, the court must eject you for the rest of the trial for disorderly conduct. Even as co-plaintiff. So long as the accused are not found guilty by a court, they are presumed innocent. Do you understand? I call witness Möller. Witness Möller, please. Good morning, Mr. Möller. Please sit down. Mr. Möller, as a father and direct relative, you may refuse to testify against your son and daughter-in-law. Is that clear? Yes. - But you wish to testify? - Yes. Then please proceed. I live in Meldorf, Schleswig-Holstein. The last storm felled a tree in my garden. I went to the garage to fetch the chainsaw. It's on my property, but my son uses it because I have no car. He lives next door, but we avoid each other. Why do you avoid each other? We fell out over his worldview. What is his worldview? The one that led to these accusations. Could you elucidate? My son reveres Adolf Hitler. You were looking for the chainsaw in the garage. What happened next? I saw a plastic bag of fertilizer and an oil can. I didn't think much of it. But there were also at least seven packs of nails. I remembered the Hamburg attack. I wanted to stop him from copying it. André has priors for assault and disorderly conduct. I went to the police and asked them to stop him. Please continue, Mr. Möller. They sent over some experts. After their search, they told me... I'll never forget it... "You wanted to protect your son from a crime he already committed." And then? - The police arrested André and Edda. - Mr. Möller... it was your son's garage? Yes. You had a key? No, I didn't. - How did you get in? - I know where the key's hidden. - Can you tell us where? - Under a big stone by the entrance. - Outside by the door? - Yes. Did anyone else know? - Your son's friends? - I don't know. So, it's conceivable that other people knew of the key and had access to the garage? - That's possible. - Thank you. - Yes, Mr. Fava? - Mr. Möller, you don't know if anyone else knew of the key. What does that mean? Did you ever see anyone else enter the garage? My daughter-in-law. Anyone else? No, never. Fine. - May I add something? - Go ahead. I want to take the opportunity to offer my condolences to the victims. I'm so sorry for what happened. You never get over losing a relative. What my son did is wicked, cowardly, and stupid. Excuse me. Do you have a light? Thanks. You're from Schleswig-Holstein, too? - Husum. - But you don't live there anymore? No. My mom and her boyfriend do. The next time you visit them, drop by for a coffee. If you'd known your son did it, would you still have gone to the police? I knew. (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) That's little Fritz. Come in. Do you have a tampon? You have your period already? Unfortunately. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) Keep them. I haven't had my period since it happened. How are you making ends meet? Nuri's life insurance. How's the trial going? They'll get their punishment, I promise you. (BABY CRIES) Someone's awake! Do you want some cake, too? You'll get something even better. (CHUCKLES) (BABY CRYING) Here you go. Shh. (BABY QUIETS) It was good to see you. (CAR DOOR SHUTS) (ENGINE STARTS) MAN: The explosive material found at the scene contained the typical components of homemade ANFO explosives. 95% ammonium nitrate, sourced from imported fertilizer, and 5% diesel. ATTORNEY: Did you find enough material for the analysis? Yes. DANILO: Mr. Fava. Can we conclude the materials in the garage match the explosive at the scene? Yes. The garage contained traces of the explosive? On the garage floor, traces of an explosive were found that are identical to those found at the scene. So, yes. REETZ: Following Mr. Möller's tip-off and seizure of evidence, every item was carefully examined for fingerprints. ATTORNEY: What kind of evidence? Over 700 Black+Decker nails three liters of diesel in a five-liter can, 50 kg of fertilizer from Israel and its packaging, components of a Bosch flashlight and of a Ninetec drone. Were all items treated with due care as potential sources of evidence? Of course. We collected trace samples and everything was sealed. What were the results of fingerprinting? Fingerprints found on items were analyzed. We found clear prints of both suspects and those of witness Jürgen Möller. Did you find any other fingerprints? Yes, one more, but it couldn't be identified. A further accomplice? It couldn't be identified. But the other fingerprint could have come from a store assistant? Correct. Mr. Reetz. I have a diesel car. So, I have a can of diesel in my garage. Sometimes I need nails in my house. There are nails in my garage. My wife is a keen gardener, so there's also a bag of fertilizer. All these items carry my fingerprints. Chief Inspector, would you conclude that I'm a bomb maker? Mr. Haberbeck, does your garage contain traces of the explosive that killed Nuri and Rocco Şekerci? No, but my key isn't kept under a stone where anyone can find it. Thank you. They'll be punished, right? I can guarantee you that. Who or what is Makris? Haberbeck's new witness from Greece. Will he be a problem? I'll fucking shred the bastard, just watch. (MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) The season runs from early May to mid-November. But we're open year-round. Guests can visit in the low season, too. Mr. Makris, might you be mistaken? Another witness claims to have seen my client in Hamburg at that time. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Impossible. - He's lying! - I remember them. They stayed from October 15th to the 20th. It's noted in my booking record. This one? Yes. Let's take a look. Mr. Makris, can you show us? (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Please sit down. Don't you think it's been squeezed in? (TRANSLATOR SPEAKING) - I'd like to present something. - Go ahead, Mr. Fava. Hm? Prosecutor, defense attorneys, please. Please take a look. You can sit down again. We'll let everyone see. Is that you? (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Yes. What's that symbol? (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) The logo of the "Golden Dawn" party. For your information, Golden Dawn is a Greek neo-Nazi party. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) It's a democratic party. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Democratically elected. The photo is from 2013 when your party tried to open an office in Kassel, Germany. It has 160 "likes." Let's see who "liked" it. Uh-huh. They're all in it together. A global Nazi network, all butt-fucking each other. - Tell it to the judge. - About the butt-fucking? Mm. He knows that. You should still tell him. Follow me. DANILO: What was Edda Möller wearing? Gray jeans, brown leather boots. Green parka, black wool cap. Was she walking from the left or the right? - Right to left. - Make-up? - No make-up. - Very good. Haberbeck will ask about your drug use. Mm. - What should I say? - The truth. It was to numb your pain. Can I say that? The police file says they found something. I guess it's the stuff I gave you? - Shit. - Forget it. If Haberbeck demands a drug test, we'll refuse. Or should we get them high from your hair? You saw her. You told the police. You told the court. They'll believe you. Right. It's late. Get some sleep. Tomorrow is showtime. Do you remember the woman's clothes? She was wearing gray jeans, brown leather boots, a green parka and a black wool cap. Any further details? I noticed the bike was new. That's why I spoke to her. Did you immediately tell police in a witness statement? Yes, I was questioned that evening and everything was recorded. I also helped to create a facial composite. Attorney, go ahead. Mrs. Şekerci, when you spoke to the woman with the bike, how far was she from you? Closer than you are. Was she leaving the bike? She was starting to leave it. - You saw her from behind. - I saw this... When I spoke to her, she turned around and looked at me. What kind of person was Nuri Şekerci? Irrelevant. My client doesn't have to answer. He was a very good person. A father and a decent man. Tell us about your husband's priors. These priors are known to police and the court. You're holding the file, read it! I have read it. Nuri Şekerci was caught with 50 kg of hash and served four years in prison. Thank you. Nuri Şekerci isn't on trial here. He's the murder victim. Your Honor, please ensure the attorney's questions are relevant. After release, did your husband continue dealing drugs or break other drug laws? No. I got pregnant right after his release. Rocco's birth was the best thing to ever happen to us. Nuri never had anything to do with drugs again. But the police found marijuana, cocaine and opium in your house. My client lost her husband and child. Understandably, she tried to numb her inconceivable pain. The quantities were for personal use. My client need not incriminate herself. Mrs. Şekerci, are you a drug addict? No. - Have you taken drugs today? - No! In the past year? - No! - My client... On the day of the crime? - No! - My client refuses to answer! I request that the witness immediately undergo a drug test and hair analysis at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in order to verify her perceptive faculty and fitness to testify at the time she allegedly saw the suspect with the bike. Thank you. The co-plaintiff must consent to that. Do you consent, Mrs. Şekerci? The defense's request is intended only to discredit the co-plaintiff. It's irrelevant to the facts of the crime and the defendants' guilt. Katja Şekerci was a loving, caring mother. Her deceased husband was a model of rehabilitation. She has suffered unimaginable pain for malicious and base reasons. She needn't accept this humiliation! She will not answer the defense's defamatory questions. Then I'll summarize. The witness refuses to undergo a drug test and psychological examination and to answer the defense's questions on her drug use. There's only one conclusion: She wants to prevent the court from establishing that she made her supposed observations and, shortly thereafter, her statement, while under the influence of drugs. Remember... She saw someone walking away and shouted something after her. She claims to have memorized a face she saw only for seconds! Again, while she was on drugs! Her attorney now claims these drugs were taken later, not to enhance her perceptive or observational skills, but "to numb her pain." She took them to forget. But let's not forget one thing. A witness who was under the influence of drugs claims to have seen the accused, Mrs. Möller, at the scene. But as witness Makris stated and confirmed with the document shown in court, she was in fact vacationing in Greece. Thank you. Go ahead, Mr. Fava. Witness Şekerci described a woman who left a bike with a top case at the scene of the explosion. She did so before forensics established that the top case contained the bomb. Forensics confirmed her statement about the bike, that it was new and unlocked, and about the top case. They also confirmed that the woman Mrs. Şekerci described must be the perpetrator. Mrs. Şekerci described this woman in the same detail as the new bike with its top case. That woman was the accused. She's married to the co-accused, whose garage happened to contain traces of the same explosive that blew up outside Nuri Şekerci's office. No drug, drug test or psychological examination can relativize this fact. And anyone who tries to do so has the same base motives as the accused did who murdered my client's husband and child. And it disgusts me to have to play the defense's game. Thank you. (CLAPPING) JUDGE: Order! (SIGHS) (CHAIRS SQUEAKING) On behalf of the people, the court returns the following verdict. The accused, André Möller and Edda Möller, are acquitted. MAN: (LAUGHING) Away from each other! Fuck this court! Behave or I'll clear the room. The state will cover the trial costs and related expenses. The defendants will be compensated for time spent in detention. Please be seated. Today's acquittal is not based on the court's belief that the defendants are innocent, but that the evidence presented leaves reasonable doubt as to their guilt. Based on the "in dubio pro reo" principle, this doubt requires that we acquit them. The court considered that the defendants did not provably have sole access to the garage. Others may have entered. The key was accessible. One set of fingerprints could not be identified. Co-plaintiff Şekerci stated that she recognized Edda Möller as the person she saw at the crime scene. We were unable to confirm the accuracy of her observation. The co-plaintiff exercised her right to refuse examination to assess her ability to testify.

No, today's no good. Katja, listen to me. Come to my office tomorrow as early as possible. Everything's ready. We'll go through the papers together. - I'll get pastries. - (CHUCKLES) I need your signature. Are you coming? (SIGHS) Yeah, OK. Good. Can you be here at eight? I can do eight. Great. I'm looking forward to seeing you. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Thanks for everything. The fight goes on, Katja. Bye. Bye. OK, go, come on! Come on, Mom! No, I just put on sunscreen. Come on, Mom! - Later. - Now! Please, Mom.
