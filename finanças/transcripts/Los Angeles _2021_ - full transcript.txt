She told me that the pig told her to pack up the angels and go to Tampa. I thought you said she didn't talk. She doesn't. Sign language? In a way. What do you mean in a way? I mean, she was little. I tried to teach her sign language, but she didn't go for it. So she made up her own. She made up her own sign language. She told you that the pig told her to go to Tampa? And take the angels. And take the angels. What was supposed to happen with the angels in Tampa? Nothing. When she got there, the pig was going to tell her and the angels how find the baby Jesus. Yeah. The baby Jesus. There's a man sits at a zoo, holds the Panda balloon, same day every month and for $50,000, he can give us a new life. I'm talking about new social security number, new name, new work references, everything. I thought you were on Agent Suitor's case. I am. Just pen shit until I can find somebody else. Who's the con? Cassius Littlefield, breaking and entering, burglary, assault, mayhem. Mayhem? Yeah, mayhem. You don't hear that much anymore. He's been behind bars more than half his life. He's a fucking idiot. Professional dirt bag. Language, Farley. Sorry, sir. I forgot, car thief. Half a dozen before going in. Owner here had the blue Chevy. Any personal information might indicate where he's headed? No clue. Six out of his eight last known addresses were prisons, so doubt he's going back to any of those. Put out a bulletin, Atlanta, Orlando, Nashville, Houston, Chicago. Agent D'Onofrio sent us some MO. Wants us to wrap this up in a hurry. I'm sorry, sir. What's a MO? Mobile unit. You and I are hitting the road. Gonna go find Mr. Littlefield. Be on the road? Yeah. It's kinda hot. Can I grab some shorts, t-shirts or something? No. If he's as dumb as you say he is, should only take a couple of days. I guess. Baby Jesus met his angels 2000 years ago, Jojo. You know the voice of God doesn't come through a television. What are you gonna do when you get there? Huh? What if the giant pig don't say anything? What if it just sits there and let you starve to death? Jojo. What the hell? Is your car? Have you seen an escaped convict? Well be on the lookout and be careful. I mean she slept in my flower bed for three nights. I was nice enough on that first day, but I mean, Jesus on a stick here, man. I can't have me some retard in my flowers right before the breakfast rush. Paul, we're here to get information on Cassius Littlefield, an escape convict who was spotted at your restaurant. Am I speaking some sort of foreign language, boys? That's what I've been trying to tell you. She went with him. Who went with him? The little pig tail girl. Wait, who's the girl? The special challenges girl, man. Special challenges? Come on boys. The fucking retard, man that was talking to the pig. She went with Cassius Littlefield? Welcome to the party, gentlemen. On the third day, that's right. Okay. So she sleeps in the planter for three nights. And on the third day you saw her get in the car with Littlefield. Bingo. Let me tell you something too. You know that boy. Ooh wee, could he drive. Let me tell you. Oh, oh, oh. And guess what? The police didn't even figure out that he'd done hot wired that Mustang he was in until after they chased him all over the place. And that's when I saw her, her little shoe shine box. But I guess you boys weren't looking for a white Mustang carrying a retard, huh? You did pretty good back there with Johnny Law, huh. I'm going go as far west as the next gas stop. After that, you're going to be on your own, got it? All right. Where you heading? Listen, I ain't gonna play no games with you. Tell me what you're heading. Speak, bitch, all right! What, you can't talk? Besides that backdoor face and barnyard odor, that makes you a pretty perfect woman, now doesn't done it? I don't suspect you have any talents as a stick up artist? What do you still kind of grifter? Well I'm on the road to make some money. If you can't help me, then I don't know what to tell you. Maybe you can help. Only a few witnesses saw the girl. Two say blonde hair. One says red hair. And all say suspenders. What's the pig say? Where have you been? I was parking the mobile unit. I had to get D'Onofrio coffee. Agent D'Onofrio's here? Yeah, I thought you knew. He's in the mobile unit right now. Hey, what's a data analyst? What are you talking about? I thought he had a witness with him and then he introduced her as a data analyst assigned to the case. She's with him? Yeah. She said something about behavioral predictive modeling. I just laughed. I thought she was kidding. Where'd you park the MO? A few blocks that way. That thing is a bitch to park. Let's go. What do you got on Littlefield? Nothing yet, sir. Nothing? Last known address, family? Oh, we were just... Barstow is the last known address. He'll find auto body shops for work. He's got an uncle in Little Pines and two aunts in Butte, but he won't go there. Good. You tie this up quick, Dillard. Yes, sir. Sir, I've still got agents, Suitor's cases, and... That is not casework, Dillard. This is janitorial work. Clear this up quickly. Yes, sir. - Yeah, I hate the MO. - I'll get it. Thank you. Agent Farley. Sir? You got a new partner. You're serious? You two are on Littlefield. Figure out the girl in the meantime. Wait, what girl? Much obliged. I would've done better if you told me I was breaking her in. Excuse me? Wait, Jojo, I love you. All right, all right. All right, Romeo, go kick some rocks. Are you shitting me? Are you a virgin? Have you ever been plowed before? What you did with that man back there in his truck, have you done that before? Oh, for crying out loud. All I got was 60 bucks. You know much I could've charged for your cherry? Do you? Take that stupid box and put it in the back. Sick of looking at it. Oh, damn. You got a change clothes back there? Well, what's in that thing? What, you got butterflies in there? You got birds? You got bird in there? Wings? You got wings at there? Angel wings, angel wings. Angels. You got angels in there. Yeah, okay. Why angels or no angels, that smell's bad for business for Christ's sakes. I mean. Hey, calm. Hey. Hey, you calm, what the fuck did I do? Calm the fuck down. What did I do? What did I say? Up? Clouds, sky more clouds. Oh, not God. God. Baby. Baby. Oh hell, that looks like some cock and balls to me. What are you doing? Okay, so God, baby, boy. God's baby boy. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ, I said Jesus Christ. I said Jesus Christ. Who gives a flying fuck? Hey. Okay, okay, I won't say it anymore. I promise. All right there, Buster Keaton. Okay. All right. All right. Get back over there. Hey, you mind if I introduce you to some of my friends? You're field trained. Why don't I do the talking? Okay. Where's your notebook? I didn't get a notebook. Stock supply closet over there. I need my phone. Let's go. Mr. Barnhart. Thank you for meeting with us. Do you know where she is? Who's that? Jojo. How can I help you? Jojo, I just need to talk to her. Jojo, yes, the girl. We're looking forward too. Do you have any idea where they were headed? Did she say anything? Never said a word. And this is the man she was with, right? I'm sorry, is that the man from? Sorry. I love her, I just need to find her. Let's just take a step back and go through a timeline, shall we? Timeline? I know how them astronauts feel at take off. When the power just overwhelms your senses. My vision went blurry and then it was just us together in each other's arms. And then, you know, right at the edge, it's like a, gonna see a vision or something. And then? Nothing. Nothing? Everything. I'm sorry, but I didn't understand you. Can you help me find her? I left my wife. I haven't even told her yet, but I'm going to leave her. How would you know what it's like to be in love with somebody so completely. And thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought. To feel every atom in your body. Cause life is nothing without Jojo. Moment with this regard their currents turn away. - I am nothing without Jojo. - To be loved. Lose the name of action. Is that Shakespeare? Who? So is this how it usually goes in the field? No, this is not how it usually goes in the field. They sound pretty heartbroken. Who gives a about them? It's just an observation. What about her, huh? Can you imagine what she's going through? He's probably going to New Orleans next. Why do you say that? He was there once in 92? Just a hunch. No offense. That's not really how you work a case. Hey, so we can't play it as loose as we did back there on the road, all right. I've got a few outstanding warrants here. Jojo. Jojo. Wait, stop. Where are you going? Hey. Hey, what was that back there? Where'd you get it at? Did you get it from the government, huh? They swear you to secrecy. Cut your tongue out. Is that why you can't talk? Hey, let me see your tongue. Let me see. Show me what's in the box please. Hey, look, I need to know what I'm working with here, okay. We're going to be partners. You need to tell me these things. You got to sound bazooka up in here and I have no idea. ♪ Hush little baby don't say a word ♪ ♪ Buy you a mockingbird ♪ Here we are. That's the place. No, this is not Los Angeles, all right. This is Austin, Texas. Listen, hey, keep those little cuckoo signals to a minimum, all right. Let me steer the course. Okay? These dumb hicks ain't gonna know what hit 'em. Now, I know she ain't much to look at, but I guarantee you this girl's going to put on the show that's gonna knock these hillbillies out of their shit-kickers, all right. Matter of fact, I do have an opening for tonight. Well, there you go, Bo. That's opportunity knocking. I think you need to answer that door. Give her a chance and she's going to be all right, you know. I was guessing this was just about the only way to stop the lies from coming out of your mouth. I don't run this joint to get hustled about two bit liars and they're silent partners. I don't know what your game is, but I get a certain feeling every time somebody is priming my pump, and son, this here hillbilly it's getting that feeling of all the way down to my shit-kickers. I'm sorry, ma'am, would you like a complimentary beverage? She looks like a scotch drinker, Bo. Real good stuff. Is that it? You a scotch drinker. What's that? Something to tickle your nose? Champagne. You're a champagne gal. Well, why I don't know. No, no, not champagne. What's it sound like that then? - Dance. - Dancer. Two dancers. Of course two dancers. And what kind of dancers? Dancers on the big screens in the movie. Oh, Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire. Fred Astaire and - Ginger Rogers. - Ginger Rogers. I said at first. I don't know about that boss. All right tie, we'll call it a tie. Now what about you? Who was first? Oh, I'm sorry. You wanted a Ginger ale? Go get her to ginger ale, Carl. On the rocks? Two rocks. Just two pieces of ice. You wanna play here tonight? All right. We'll see about that. I don't know what's going on. Why don't you write down the name of the last place you played. And if you were planning on getting out of here alive, you better hope they've got some rave reviews. Hmm. That's all right. You gurgle that if you want. Name, place, number. Don't let him go anywhere. How hard do you think it's going to be for me to find some on your record that's going to jog your memory. There a problem? Yeah, your boy is not cooperating. See, unlike the FBI, I don't hide a boys. Why don't you and me go someplace where we can handle this? - Let's go. - Let's go. You ever seen that guy? No. I got more than a few dozen eye witnesses that put them in your place a few nights ago. You want to take another look? Never seen him. Maybe you should take a look at that badge. That ain't one of those faggot ass star badges. That's a real deal shield right there with a fucking eagle on top. That flies anywhere it damn well pleases. He'll rip your fucking balls off with his talons. Yes. Yeah, hello, this is Bo calling from the Branding Iron in Austin, Texas. Now, I hate to bother you, but you didn't happen to have a two bit, white trash wannabe con artist come by trying to pedal you some skinny little freaky ass silent girl, now did you? I did. You did? Did you let her perform? Yeah. How'd that turn out for you? It was glorious. Please give them my regards. Who was that? Your mama. You motherfucker! You pimping her out too? You're going to tell us exactly what I want to know or I'll fucking put your ass behind bars. Do you understand me? What the fuck was that sound? Tell me now! Agent Farley, calm down. Let that motherfucker go. Come put your hands on me, boy. You'll taste a long dark night. Go outside and get some fresh air. Go outside. You gonna good cop me now? I'm not sure I'm a cop. We have over 100 eyewitnesses who see her at your place. Lying to that man outside will get you seven years, no doubt. It doesn't make any sense. What happened that night in your place? I don't know. You're not going to believe you if I told you. But that little woman marched right into my club like she owned the place. And all of a sudden that's scrawny, white trash motherfucker comes in, asking for half the house while she plays. And then all of a sudden she stops. She puts her ear to the shoeshine kit. And she opens up the kit and she pulls out this box and it's about this big. She looks scared, you know. And she opens it. And this is the tiniest little creek, like that, the box hadn't been opened in years. There was a silence first and then, and then. And then? Horns. Thousands of them blaring. Tens of thousands of horns, all the horns that ever was, just was so powerful. The sound overwhelmed me. Then there was, there was a vulnerability to it. A tenderness. So then what happened? How long did it last? A minute, an hour, a couple of days. I don't know. All of a sudden it just stopped. She closed a little box and it's like we've all just woke up from a dream. And then she came up to me and she kissed me on my cheek and I gave her every dollar I had. Are you sure you've got something for all these people here tonight? What the hell's it gonna sound like? What do you mean? What does that mean? All right. You're up, little lady. Take a seat, Cash. Go get 'em. Here's your money? Bo wanted me to deliver it personally. And just make sure everything goes all right. T.C. Thanks for coming. Can I get your drink? I'm all set. Thank you. Right. Well next one's on the house. Does Bo know you're here? Nope. Are you looking for anything in particular? I'm always looking for something particular. Who's your friend? He ain't no friend. Well, he's still upright. Bo must be losing his touch. The coin's still up in the air. For the first time on the Branding Iron stage, we'd like to welcome Jojo. Good to see you, Carl. Mr. Littlefield. Mr. Littlefield, you can't keep doing what you're doing without getting caught It's Cash, and I ain't got no other choice. Cash. We always got other choices. Now what do you need? I need you to stop wasting my time right now. What do you really need? A man that can help a man like you. I need to get to San Diego in two weeks. And I need $50,000. How much you got? Almost 16. In shows? In other things. You're forgetting one other thing. What's that? You need to keep from getting arrested. Well, there's that, yeah. Okay. Here's the deal. Two shows. First one in Albuquerque. Second one in Phoenix. I'll give you 15 grand when you get to Albuquerque, another 25 grand when you get to Phoenix. You're on your own with a law until you get to Phoenix. But once you get her to that show, I guarantee you safe passage to San Diego. Deal? So I need a duck the law until Phoenix? That's right. Y'all be in Albuquerque by Friday? Deal. You a coyote? No. What the hell are you? I'm an impresario. Okay. Time to go. When she got there, the pig was going to tell her and the angels to find the baby Jesus. Yeah. The baby Jesus. You didn't try to stop her? You going to try to find my girl or what? We're just trying to gather the details. So gather the ones that's going to help the situation. I got to tell you, it's curious. You let her go out into the world, according to you for the first time ever, with no money and nobody to stay with. Ain't nobody gonna make her do something she don't want to do. What do you want us to do, ask the pig these questions? I want you to find my girl. All right, she's not your girl. There is no birth certificate. There's no proof of any kind of... Goddammit, she's my child. She is not your child. Look, we're trying to help. Okay. Now, you got a, you have a wife, Yvonne and a daughter, Shirley, right? Will she go to them? She never met them. I don't know where they stay. Why is that? Restraining order? You are a vile man. Help us understand the situation. I was a drunk. I mean a drunk. Finally, my wife left, took the kid. I went on a bender and I ended up in the back of this hotel with a baby Jojo in my arms. And I never drank since. Did she say anything? Did you talk about anything that would give us any idea of what she would do after Tampa? I put my phone number in her pocket and I told her to call me. That's the best I could do. Why didn't you go with her? You put your phone number in her pocket? Yeah. I saw that she was in New Orleans on TV. Trust me. She's going to Tampa to find a pig. Find the pig. You give the angels your number too? What is your problem, man? We've been to Tampa. You found the pig? Yeah. We found the pig. Gary's Barbecue Pit. We talked to the owner who saw her there. We know who picked her up there too. What is it, Agent Woo? They were spotted in Austin. There's been an event. I'll call the Austin field office. Mr. Tucker, thank you for your time. We will notify you as soon as we have any pertinent details. I'm not going anywhere until I get an apology. I'm sorry. You didn't do anything. Who picked her up? She's with Cassius Littlefield, a convict who recently escaped from Peltier prison in South Carolina. Here's my card. I promise to call you with an update as soon as we get to Austin. Better tell you a guy to learn some manners. Thank you for your time. Sir, they have the club owner in custody. May I conduct a session, please? A session? A questioning. Agent Farley doesn't have the tact from what I've seen in order to empathize with these people. These people? The witnesses, sir. Agent Farley, come over here. Agent Farley, Ms. Woo here doesn't think that you have the tact necessary to gather the information we need from our witnesses. Now that may or may not be the case, but what is indisputable is that it's taking us far too long to catch a two bit con artist and a mute with a circus act. I attribute this mostly to your lack of team mark. I'm going to jump on a flight, go to Austin, check into a hotel, wash the stench of this mobile unit off my body and go to sleep. That gives you two a long ride to figure out how to work together and put this case back on track. Where am I meeting him? Austin PD. Who's the club owner? Bo Mansor. Oh, and Ms. Woo, when you question the bar owner, you'd better gather the necessary information to put this case to bed. I will. Bo, you gotta tell us something. What were they wearing? What did they look like? Did they say anything to you? Anything, just tell us anything? Okay, let's start with your name, okay? What's your name, Bo? What's your name, Bo? I got this. You don't have shit. Bo? What's your fucking name, Bo? Tell us your fucking name. Your name is Bo fucking Mansor. Fucking tell us your name. What happened to when she opened the box? Bo? Your name is Bo Mansor. Say it. Was it a box? Okay, that's enough. She opened a box, didn't she? You're gonna end up with a box soon enough. You heard the horns, right Bo? - There were horns. - Thank you. Mr. Mansor, you've been very helpful. Please kindly escort Mr. Mansor out so that we can continue our investigation. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Get up. Okay, here we go. That's just regular coffee? Yeah. You should try a latte. I've tried lattes. Strings. Not horns. Stings. $50,000 and a new life, shit. Panda man. He's just sitting there with a balloon. I mean a panda man. He better be there, that's all I know. No, we're not going. We're not in Los Angeles yet, all right. I gotta take a leak. You sit tight. Jojo opened up the door. Jojo open the door. It's my car. It's not mine, but just open it up. No, no. We got to go to Albuquerque. Because I said so. I don't care what them angels have to say. They don't know everything. Look okay. I will get you to Los Angeles, I promise. But we got to go to Albuquerque first. Jojo, listen, you listen to me and you listen good, all right. You do what I tell you to do. Now you open up this door or I swear to, you have no idea what I'm capable of doing. Jojo, open up the door. You two are a shit show. So what's the problem? He's a gorilla. I mean, I don't even know where to begin. He's thoughtless and impulsive and worst of all, he's proud of it. Like that's what justice is all about. He's an animal. And he's supposed to represent the law? That's a joke. I do yoga, you know. I mean not when I'm on a case, but every once in a while. Yeah, I think I, I read, I investigate, and I do yoga when there's time for that shit. But I'm out here on the road trying to catch a convict who's pimping out a young woman. So I'll follow his scent. I'll hunt him down like the well-trained animal I am. I might hurt some feelings along the way, but you can bet I'll do everything in my power to find this man. You can bet when I do, I'll bring him to justice. What did I ever really do to her? Yeah, well, I guess I did do her wrong. It ain't like, what the hell was I supposed to do? Shit. Damn. Jojo, please, please, I'm sorry, all right. Please, I'm sorry for what I've done done to you. Just please open this door, please. I just want to talk. I want to talk to you please. Please? All right, thank you. Oh, thank you so much. Okay, thank you. Hey, listen, okay. Hey, listen, I've been treating you the way people been treating me my whole life and it's not right. And I just want you to know I'm sorry. All right. You want me to go? To Los Angeles? Okay, okay. We'll go to Los Angeles, all right. Hey, and another thing I, I ain't never going to introduce you to any more of my friends back there. What? You don't want to go to Los Angeles anymore? You need more time? Okay, well, well I got to get to San Diego in a week and a half. And if you could, I just need two stops, okay? I need Albuquerque and Phoenix. If you could do that just for me, I would really appreciate it. Yeah. Oh, thank you so much. Oh, you're a real pal. And another thing, if it's okay, do you think you could play for me in Albuquerque? Yeah. Yeah? Oh man. All right, let's go. Where's that damn screwdriver? I got a booger? Hello there. Well, that's awfully nice of you. That's for her, Cash. It's for you. Shit ton of people out there. Come on, Cash. You want to skip out now? Have me take her to Phoenix? That depends, you got 40 grand? No. 15 like we agreed on. Let's go, Jojo. Hey, about Phoenix, I was just thinking. About Phoenix. Come on, let's go, let's go. Get in the car. Get in the car. Good evening. I have information that could lead to the capture of escaped convict, Cassius Littlefield. I'd like to speak with the agent in charge of the investigation. Yes, I can hold. Hey, I know you played, okay. I know you did. I know you played for me and I appreciate that, okay. But you and I need to start going to the specifics of what these shows are going to entail because I don't think it's too damn difficult for you to put on a fucking dress, okay. It's simple. You put that dress on, okay? And then you grab your little box. You little government issued fucking sound whatnot. And you flip the lid and you watch the faces melt. It's that simple. Oh, you will go to truck stop now? No. I ain't take you no more truck stops. Kiss my fucking grits. Oh, you can pout all you want, huh? Go ahead and be a little baby back there. Back in the early 90s, this was before the three strikes and you're out legislation, there was a budget shortfall and a rise in escape attempts. - That... - I got a no foam for you. Thank you. This is nonfat, right? Yeah. Wait. Yeah, you're good. Continue. The prisons asked the fed and the fed asked the bureau to help. So we created the Panda man and we had our informants push the story throughout the prison system. Wait a second. Wouldn't that make more convicts try to escape? Yes, that's what they were hoping for. That way they would get the funding they needed and maybe not work too hard to catch the cons. So our guy is chasing a ghost that we put in the prison gossip mill 25 years ago. That's what it looks like. And we still can't catch him? You sure this is nonfat? Yeah. Dillard. Yeah. Yeah. Albuquerque. Okay. We're on our way. Fucking Panda man. Come on. Do we have a deal? There was a performance at the Albuquerque rodeo pavilion. Can you tell us about that? Yeah, I'd rather not. Humor us. She took out her bells and she started playing them. Then she might've been a song, I don't know. We hadn't miked her up yet. She took out, Kazoo started playing that and bells. After that she took out some road band strung around her fingers. Somehow was playing the bells, the kazoo and rubber bands all at the same time. It sounds interesting. It was charming. Did she open a box? No. Did you care for the performance? No. Did you pay him? Yes. How much? $15,000. For five minutes of bells, rubber bands and a kazoo. Hey, I play a mean tambourine if you're interested. How did you come across Mr. Littlefield and Jojo? Saw him performing the Branding Iron, Austin, Texas. Same performance? No. Can you describe that performance? No. You're going to tell us what we want to know. No, I won't because I can't. Now I can help you apprehend Mr. Littlefield. I'll lead you right to him. So do we have a deal? We have a deal. Okay. And after I hand him over, remember, the show must go on. Jojo? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened? Did you play the third angel? Did people hear? Did they pay? Come on, let's get out of here. We gotta skedaddle. Hey, let's start from the beginning, all right. Where are you from? Back in Tampa where I picked you up? I don't know what that is, but you said you're going to Los Angeles, right? Okay but why do you need to go to Los Angeles? Okay, hold on. I don't know. I don't know if that is okay. You've got to slow down a little bit. We got a lot of road ahead in front of us. So how about you just hop in here. We'll get it all figured out on the way. As you were saying, you were folding paper? Asleep? Bed. You were making a bed. Well, that's a good start right there. So it was the pig. The pig on the television had told you to take the angels home to Los Angeles, to help you find the baby Jesus. And the fifth angel is going to help you find the baby Jesus. Okay. And these angels only want to play when they're ready to, right? And only once. Okay. Well, do you have any idea when the fourth agent wants to play? Nope. Well, what the hell? I got to see if we still have a show in Phoenix. And even we do, how the hell we supposed to get to without Johnny Law trying to cut my up. Well, we got to play it safe. Get off the road. I don't know, get some rest. Well. No. No. I cannot. These angels, they're not gonna approve of the arrangements I made with you and my friends. Nope, can't do it. How the hell am I supposed to say no to that face? We did have a show technically speaking. There was a show, okay. I understand it didn't work out the way that everybody intended it to, but we did have a show. Okay, that, okay, listen, TC. All I need to know is if we're still good for Phoenix. I still believe in your Cash. We're good to go in Phoenix. Be there in three days. Tunnel 28. I'll take good care of you. Thanks for letting me use your phone, man. Now how the hell am I going to get us there? Where do you want to go? I got to go to Tunnel 28 in the Phoenix Convention Center. Three days from now. That ain't a problem. Oh yeah it is, Dale, cause listen, I'm a wanted man. And there's going to be Sheriff's departments everywhere. Of course I know you're a wanted man, Cash. Well, you don't know is I'm a teamster trucker and a teamster trucker could deliver a payload to the Pope's asshole and God himself wouldn't even know it was there. You don't say, huh? Well, how much you going to set me back? I'm not doing it for money, Cash. I'm doing for love. Okay, okay, listen up. Listen up. Now, Mr. Henning will go into the storage room and give Littlefield the money and grab Jojo. That's when we take Littlefield. And remember this show must go on. Sure. Now agents Farley and Woo will transport Littlefield to DC. We'll fall in the morning with Jojo. Now when he gets here. And he'll text me when he gets here. We've got 50 troopers out there. We'll know when he gets here. Oh, he just texted. He is here. Where? Storage room 28. How the hell did he get there? I don't know. Do you want me to text him? No, goddammit. This is green. Go! Shine box, go, go now! Move out! Come on. Goddammit! Exit secure? Yeah, Woo's got Littlefield. I'll get the girl. So you gave the order to move out. Then what happened? Everything went according to plan, we apprehended Littlefield. Then you let a material witness in the kidnapping perform? That was part of the deal. Well, she got onstage. What did she do? She takes a little box out and then she holds the box up, opens it. What was in the box? A voice. But it wasn't coming from the box. It was coming from near the front of the stage. I couldn't tell where because the lights were in my eyes. And then as I'm looking around, all of a sudden, another voice joins in from further away and another and another. By the end, an amphitheater was singing. But it wasn't a song, it was more like a voice. But it was musical. And. I'm not going to describe this well. Just a sec. I am curious. When you said that by the end everybody was singing. Does that include you? Agent Dillard, just after Littlefield got away, and just before Jojo got away, were you in an amphitheater singing? Yes, sir. Yes I was. How did she get away? She just walked out. Nobody did anything. Security cameras show her getting into a car with Littlefield down near the end of the tunnel. Well, there's your bus to Los Angeles. Here's the ticket. Look, I, I'm not really that good with goodbyes, but I'm really gonna miss you. No, that bus is for you for Los Angeles. I got to go down to San Diego and I got a tie up some loose ends. Jojo, hold on. Come on. We know is I'm a wanted man. This is not, this is not going to work out, all right. You, you cannot bait. What are you? What are you doing, Jojo? Okay, listen, Jojo, get, get up, please get up. I promise, just you and me, I promise, come on. All right. All right, come on, get up. Grab your box, let's go. Come on. Let's go, all right. You sure do like that grape soda, don't you? Yeah. I told you that grape soda's the jam, isn't it. What? What's that? What you gotta use the restroom? All right. All right, hold on. We'll pull up over here, don't worry. Hey Jojo, don't forget your angels, all right. You never know. How the fuck did I end up as the Panda man? How would somebody raised in prison be dumb enough to believe this shit? I guess we all got something to believe in. I'm still gonna open up that cafe. It's gonna be cool as shit. Where the is Littlefield? What's up boss? Let me get a 40 on pump three. And these two grapes sodas. Hey little man, you gonna get caught one of these days. I ain't afraid of getting caught. You gonna go to jail. I ain't afraid of jail neither. Well that ain't the worst of it. You're gonna end up being alone with nothing and nobody to live for. Is that what you want? Fuck you, old man. Had to get some more grape soda. I suppose I need to find a phone book so I could get the address of some stadiums, arenas, whatnot. Do you even though what you're looking for? Well it looks like they got some underground hide out. Watch your step there. This the place, yeah. Who do you want me to call? Everybody? When do you wanna play? Tomorrow. Okie dokie, smokey. Headphones? Ear muffs? You need some ear muffs. Okay. Every truck driver west of the Mississippi is heading to a small church on 21st and Canal. It's true. Did you call the dad? He's meeting me at the church. Black, right? Yeah. Great. Latte? I'm just scared. I've never been scared to go back to jail before. I mean other times, it didn't really matter. Now it's, it's just a little different, you know? What, are you scared too? Don't be scared. You ain't gotta go to jail. I'll tell them I kidnapped you. You'll be all right. She's ready to go? She's not going to perform now? Are you afraid of the fifth angel? You and the other angels are afraid of that fifth angel. What's going to happen when she comes out of that box? Better wake up in there. Put on a good show, all right? Okay, she got you. Don't worry. Jojo. All right, up you go. All right, I'm gonna create a distraction. I'm gonna go on the other side of the church. I'm a call your name. You come on out. Don't pay no mind what happens to me. You just let that fifth angel do her thing. Okay. Good luck, Jojo. - Jojo! - Hands up! Can I help you? You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. Yes, sir. Get in there. Get off me, man. Waiting for you at the San Diego Zoo. You dipshit, didn't you know we'd be here waiting for you? Yeah. Yeah. That girl's something else, huh? You expect me to believe you sacrificed yourself for her? Or maybe I just know where I belong. Put this on. Hey. What was in those boxes? How would I know? Hey, why are you doing this? Because I'm the fucking Panda man. You know, you never should've let her in in the first place. Well, I wasn't going to just leave her out on the street. You know I will. Marcus, I tried calling the shelter and the phones are still down. I don't care about a shelter. Well, Isaiah likes her. You got about as much sense as him and all this. You got any friends who live here? You got any family anywhere? I'll give him a call. Thanks for coming. Thank you. Hey you. Hey there little bronco. Hey. Marcus, what's going on? Shirley? Daddy. There's a two-year program I've been accepted into, but we, we still have to figure out when I can start. Mr. Tucker, would like a drink? Water would be fine. You sure you don't want a drink? Marcus. Mr. Tucker... Samson. Samson, you can understand my concern here. Yeah, man. I understand your concern. Daddy, you... Baby, please. What else am I supposed to call him? Call me Samson. You, you still playing that whole guitar? Only for myself these days. Well, you look like you doing good. I still got my demons. Shirley, I'm so sorry. And I'm really happy that you're doing okay. That's appreciated, but you know... I know. We'll be out of here in a minute. What did she say? She wants to give the baby something. What do you want to give him? We can't accept that. Wait, hold on a second there. You can debate amongst yourselves, but I've never known her to do anything that she didn't want to do. Well, it's late. So I think you guys can just at least stay the night. Please. All right. We'll do that. Thank you. Good morning. You're leaving? Do you know where you're going? Okay. I'm not going back there. I'll figure something out. Play my music. You think I'll ever see you again? Hey. You leaving so soon? Yeah. Well, would you like some coffee before you go? Thank you. Hey you. Hey you. Where's Jojo? I don't know.
