[WOMAN ON TV SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] WOMAN 1: Marlene is a past winner who looks like she can still win the day. How do you choose? WOMAN 2: Oh, I think there is always one standout, Carrie, one extra special girl. We do know it will be tears of joy for one of them. Now, let's go back to Dan. DAN: [ON TV] Well, here we are at last. We are down to our three finalists and aren't they all lovely and deserving? It's gonna be Miss Garden Grove. Mmm-hmm. They always give it to a farm girl. They're more virtuous. Ladies, congratulations. Now, I'll announce the names in reverse order...Dad. MR. FLANDERS: Yeah. And the last one standing will be our dream girl. Our very own... That other one sure filled out a bathing suit, though. Oh. You would say that.[CHUCKLES] Wouldn't you, sweetheart? DAN: [ON TV] And here we go. MRS. FLANDERS: Aww, she is so nervous. Well, she has to win. It'll break her heart if she doesn't. DAN: And the first runner-up is... Miss Cedar Rapids! MRS. FLANDERS: Oh! I knew she'd win. I knew it. Didn't I tell you? [GASPS] Oh, look, she is so excited. Cedar Rapids had the better figure. That other one's a little shy in the bust department for my money. [CROWD CHEERING ON TV]Oh. Oh. JANET: Life doesn't seem fair. Why should one girl's dream come true and not the other's? We should be able to control it so our dreams always do come true. Everyone would be so much happier that way. 'Cause, who wants to be first runner-up? I think when you're 24, there is still time for all your dreams to happen. I read an article that said, "The only attitude to take is the most positive one available." So, that's the one I take. Because I know my moment's coming. Good morning, Mr. Doering. I thought I'd beat you in this morning, Janet. Sure are the early bird, aren't you? Hmm. [GIGGLES] [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [SIGHS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SIGHS] So, what you got today? Meh. The usual. [CHUCKLES] WOMAN: I want one with the bride and groom kissing, that one's not romantic enough. I have a nice one here, arm-in-arm. About the angel food cake, Mrs. Flanders, you can't have five layers with angel food. It's not solid enough. Mom, I want angel food cake, so does Phil. Uh, um, honey, if he says it isn't strong enough... Honey, what do you think? Honey? Janet? Janet. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] I think the bride and groom should be like the one on Tom and Nicole's cake, dancing. [LAUGHS][JERRY LAUGHS] [SNORTS] Oh, no. Please? Oh, man. [CHUCKLES] [BOTH LAUGH] Hmm. [WATER SPLASHING] [DOOR OPENS] Do you mind? You're weird. Bothers me when it's on. Look, you better put it in gear, okay? I told you, I got an old softball buddy rolling in tonight. Come on. I hate to eat and run, but, uh, you know. You know, once on Oprah I saw this thing on married men who stray. Oh, here we go again. I guess they rarely, actually leave their wives. Unless, of course, the other woman breaks it up. Hey, I told you. The divorce is happenin'. Might not happen before this factory overhaul is history and I am out of this Popsicle stand but... Look, we'll talk about it, okay? But just not right this second. I know you don't want my friend to catch you like that. Well, bye. Okay. [BRAKES SCREECHING][GASPS] Are you, uh, okay? Uh-huh.You sure? [CHUCKLES] You should be more careful. You, uh, gave me quite a scare there. Listen, it's, it's real cold. Can I give you a ride somewhere? No, uh, um, my car is right there. You sure you're okay? [SIGHS] [SIGHS] [LAUGHING] Hey, what's up? Man, I really appreciate you doing this for me. JANET: I can't believe it. Tonight, I almost got run over, and it could turn out to be the most thrilling... The most fateful encounter that's ever happened to me in my whole life. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] I'm gonna head to the truck.Yeah, yeah. If you're here, I'll see you later. JANET: "He took her manfully in his arms, "unashamed of his need. "But his lips on hers were tentative. "And the tenderness of his kiss told her "more than any words could. "The love meant for his wife was now hers, "as it was ever fated to be. "'He's mine,' she thought. "'Mine, always. "'He'll do anything for me.' "Madeleine wished she could freeze this mo..." [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] I'm the guy who tried to run you over last night. Jerry's friend. Jerry, the project manager? Janet, right? I'm Brett. Brett Becker. Hmm. [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] BRETT: I grew up in a place just like this. They're all the same, high school, community college, nowhere job, tie the knot with someone you have known since the fourth grade. Next thing you know, you got three kids, and bang, it's over. You retire with a gold-plated watch. No, thanks. I mean, why settle? What, 'cause you're not born into the elite? Heck, you can become elite. I mean, you could meet someone, your whole life could change. But you can't sit back, you have to break out. Find what you want and grab it. Do what you want, be what you want. That make any sense to you? Yes. Yes, I feel exactly the same way. I mean, I have those exact same feelings. Only I can't... Well, you put it so well. So how long have you known Jerry? Mr. Singleton? Um, I don't really know him that well. I mean, you know, when he comes into the office for work... He seems nice, though. Not like you. [CHUCKLES] I mean, not as nice as you. BRETT: Nice. The sunset's nice, right? Then it goes down, and all you have is darkness. That's reality for you. [GIGGLES SOFTLY] Dreams are better. Dreams... [SIGHS] If you can make 'em come true. Yes. [GROANS SOFTLY] I can't believe this. I feel like I'm in a car ad or something. I should be putting the moves on you right now, but I'm not gonna do that. I'll tell you why. You're different, Janet. You deserve better than just another selfish jerk. You're not a jerk. Thank you for the benefit of the doubt. I'm not sure guys should always get it. [LAUGHS SOFTLY] JANET: Tonight, it finally happened. I prayed and prayed it would, and it did. And it was even more wonderful... More sublime than I ever imagined. I think with Jerry I'd always be the runner-up, but with Brett, well... [GIGGLES] When your life gets touched by magic, you can't question it. You just have to grab for it, and never let it go. Never been to the Windy City at all, huh? [CHUCKLES] I've seen it in movies. Yeah, well, you should see the view from my office. Oh, man. 30th floor, Michigan Avenue. The lake. Best view in the world for my money. I'd love to. WAITRESS: More coffee?Oh, no. Thank you. Can I have the check, please?Sure. Um, Brett, you know how you were saying yesterday about people who leave and people who stay behind? Mmm-hmm. It's like everyone who's still here has given up on their dreams. I mean, I still expect things to happen in my life. Ever since I was little I had this feeling that something special would happen. That there was somebody special waiting for me and that my whole life would change. The moment I saw you, I knew. You know that you are, don't you? Special? 'Cause you know what you want. I do. [JANET BREATHING] [MOANING] [SNORING] [PHONE RINGING] [PHONE BEEPS][SOFTLY] Hello. Oh, hi. No, no, no, I'm fine. I'm just napping. Yeah, hold on a second. Well, you too. So do I. [SNIFFS] [TOILET FLUSHES] [EXHALES] [DOOR OPENS] Oh. I didn't wanna wake you. It was good, wasn't it? Didn't I make you happy? [LAUGHS] Are you kidding? It was... Come here. Come here. [SWITCHES CELLPHONE OFF] I can make you happier than you've ever been. [KISSES] I know I can. [SIGHS] You wouldn't need anyone else. Hmm.Ever. [BREATHING HEAVILY] You don't know who I really am. You don't know who I can be. All you have to do is give me a chance. [MOANS SOFTLY] I can show you. Let me show you who I am. A secret part of me that nobody ever sees. I wanna show you. You wanna see it, don't you? [BREATHING] You know what you have to do. Oh. Oh. "Nothing happened." Yeah, right! Come on. You got the glow. You got the post-Janet glow.Jerry. Told you she'd blow your mind. Did I exaggerate? Huh? She's a nice girl deep down. Deep down. Deep down, she's a regular little volcano. Hey, look, you asked me to come down here and I did, okay? But...Hold on a second, who's doing who the favor here? Well, I told you about her, you said she was the perfect... Just stop messing her over, all right? [KNOCK ON DOOR] Well... Brett, I, I, I forgot. I was gonna invite you over tomorrow night for dinner. My mom said that you could... [SADLY] You're leaving? Janet, my office called, and I have to leave for Milwaukee. But I'm really glad you came by. 'Cause I wanted to see you before I left. [SNICKERS] I never expected to meet someone like you here. I really didn't. And I'll be back. I promise I will. You believe me, don't you, Janet? Stay away from Jerry. He's going nowhere. You, you're meant to go places. You're very special, Janet. I know that. I just hope that you do. Kiss me good bye. [MOANS] Well, I better hit the road. Okay? [EXHALES] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] Oh, your wallet was in my pocketbook. Thanks. Well, I'll talk to you soon. Okay? So, you wanna come in, now that you're here? Brett said to stay away from you. Oh, give me a break. I got news for you, come tomorrow night, he won't even remember your name. Why, did you think he was going to take you to Chi-Town, pop the question? Social climber like Brett Becker wouldn't look twice at somebody like you. Temp from Cedar Falls who still lives with her parents. The only reason he slept with you is because I asked him to. As a favor, Janet, to get you out of my hair. [CANS CLATTERING] Anything penetrating in there? [SIGHS] Give me your wedding ring. JANET: It's so funny, the turns life can take. One minute everything is fine and then suddenly...[SIRENS WAILING] And then suddenly... Suddenly, everything you want comes true. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] BRETT: Jerry, are you in there? Mr. Singleton? Is anyone in there? Is anyone there? Jerry! JANET: I can't believe I've been here two months already. I just can't say no to that man. It's so reassuring when a man knows what he really wants. Besides, it's better than Brett having to come all the way to Cedar Falls all the time. And Chicago is so... Romantic. How could anyone live here and not be in love? No, he didn't call. She's just jealous. I just hope his business meeting went okay. He's been worrying about it all week. JANET: "My darling, after too long, "Saturday was so special. "I can still feel you in every part of me. "Valentine, will you be mine? "XXX, Janet." [KISSES] Oh. Hello, Millie, it's Janet. Is he there? No, don't disturb him. Just tell him to call me at home. [CHUCKLING] Okay, thank you. Come on, Janet. Let's go. JANET: Everything would be perfect if Brett's job wasn't so demanding. It's hard not seeing him every day. But I think it is really important for a woman to be supportive. [SIGHS] There you are. [CHUCKLES] Everyone's been waiting, come on. Ah! You're late. [CHUCKLES] Anything good? Just the usual, yeah. Take a look. Gotta open all this myself. Hi, darling. Yeah, I did. That's why I'm calling. Well, they scheduled a late meeting on me. Looks like I'm gonna be stuck again. I... Yeah... Yeah... I'll be there the... Yes, I'll be there as soon as I can. I know. I hate being apart from you, too. I love you more. No, no, no, I love you more. No. [CHUCKLES] Okay, okay, I give up. Yeah, I'll see you later. Bye-bye. [EXHALES] [DOOR OPENS] Hi. [EXHALES] Oh, God, help me. Help me. Help me. [MOANS] [SNIFFLING] Hey, Janet. Janet, what's wrong? Hmm? Oh, I'm just so... [LAUGHS] I've always dreamed of going to Hawaii... [SNIFFLES] ...with a man just like you. Oh. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] [SNIFFLES] Um, have you given any more thought to my sister's wedding? I've thought about it. It'd mean so much to my family if you could be there. I've told them so much about you. We don't have to decide this second. Look, I hate to say it, but I'm gonna be late for this engagement. Oh, honey. Your business party. Where does the time go with you and me? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] We're just trying to get some ideas. Oh, these are just like mine. See? [GIGGLES]Oh, they are popular these days with teenagers. Oh... It's beautiful. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Oh, Mom. Hi. Fine. No, Brett's here. Wanna say hi? Look, I have to be somewhere in five minutes. Oh, he's in the bathroom. Well, he has to fly to Denver on business. But he said he'll try and fly in late Friday night. Yeah, I know. He's so sweet. You'll see. [WHISPERING] Mom says she can't wait to meet you. Look, Janet... Forget it, I'm late.Mmm. So, how is she? Is she nervous? [CHUCKLES] She did? That's typical. I must say, he does have taste. Still think I'm marrying beneath me? Darling, I'm as fond of him as you are. Even your father would have approved. Lord knows he could not stand the boys you saw fit to bring home. I just think, for someone in your position, a prenuptial agreement... Brett.I'm sorry I'm late. It was crazy at the office. I left right in the middle of a meeting. I told them I wasn't about to keep my fiance, and far more importantly, my fiance's mother, waiting. [CHUCKLING] Oh. Oh, my. He is the charmer. Watch the charmers, I always say. They're the dangerous ones. [INHALES SHARPLY] [CLEARS THROAT] With Harry gone, you'll be the man of the family, Brett. Kathleen and I are counting on you to take the reins. BRETT: Thank you. Of course, you won't have a problem with a prenuptial agreement. I'd prefer one, to tell you the truth. As long as it says I get to keep the mother-in-law. KATHLEEN: Darling, are you sure? It's not my idea. Are you all right?Hmm? It does bother you, doesn't it?No, no, no. I'm fine. It's just, things are a little crazy right now, that's all. [READING] Mrs. Brett Becker, nee Flanders. WOMAN: Oh, aww.[INDISTINCT CHATTER] [WOMAN CRYING IN JOY] [LAUGHING] VERONICA: Oh, let me see your ring. [GASPS]Oh, I know. Isn't it stunning?Beautiful. Brett insisted that we go for quality over size. And actually, when you're buying diamonds, you have to remember the three C's. Cut, color and clarity. How's my girl? [KISSES]Oh, Dad. Now, you put this in your freezer. And one year from today, on your first anniversary, you'll take it out, and each of you will have a piece. [SNIFFLES] And you'll be happy forever and ever. Oh! [ALL GASPING] [ALL LAUGHING] [ALL EXCLAIMING] ALL: Oh. Yeah.[CHUCKLES] MAN: Catch you later. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Honey, we're all so sorry Brett couldn't make it. You'll just have to whisk him back here first chance after Hawaii. [CHUCKLES] Got all your shorts? Oh, mom. You don't need shorts to go to Hawaii. [CHUCKLING] Oh, well, I hope not. Oh, you know that friend of Brett's who died in the fire that might have been arson? You remember, that was in-charge of the refitting thing at the factory? Well, they finally decided it was just an accident. Janet, what is it? Life can be so sad sometimes. The way it turns out for some people. Well, let's not think about that. Let's just think happy thoughts. JANET: It's just so beautiful. I feel like I'm in one of those perfume ads, you know, like Calvin Klein. It's just so perfect. Doesn't the lake make you feel like a little speck in the eyes of God? Oh, wouldn't it be perfect to get married up here? We could do the ceremony right by the water. I think I was meant to be here today. If I want something badly enough, if I wish for it every minute as hard as I can, it'll happen. Ham or chicken? Whatever.Hmm. Ham. [GIGGLES] I made it myself. You know, back home I used to be in-charge of all the picnics. Hmm? I never told anyone about this special... [SIGHS]Well, it's almost like this power that I have. I didn't have anyone to share it with. Nobody ideal... Till I met you. That's when I knew what this feeling was for. [POKER CLANGING] [SIGHS] Janet. Hmm? I, uh... What, lamby? I don't know how to say this. Um... I asked you to meet me here because... Oh, man.[GIGGLES] Oh, you are so sweet. This is hard for men, I know. What is? Don't you wanna pop a certain question? Pop? Oh, you gotta be kidding me. No, what I want is, to make something clear to you. Okay? First of all, this... This Hawaii thing... We might have to postpone it. I know, you said you had something coming up. Look, it, it doesn't matter, we can go next month. [SHOUTING] Would you shut up! Would you please just shut up for once, and listen? I'm listening, honey. [GROANS] When did I ever say I would go to Hawaii with you, ever? Not once did I even mention that I would go to Hawaii with you! Well, maybe it was my idea. It was your fantasy. I mean, where do you come up with this... Brett, I know what you're trying to say. Come here. Come here. [SIGHS] [GROANS] [EXHALES]I understand. I really do. I know what you've been going through. [BRACELET JINGLING] It's hard. Oh, Janet. Janet... Oh, I know, baby, I know. I know what's wrong. I'll help you. [BRACELET JINGLING LOUDLY] [INHALES SHARPLY] Don't you ever take that thing off? Drives me crazy, this constant ting-ting-ting-ting. I mean, charm bracelet? It's for teenagers. Grow up. You are not gonna get me again. You are not gonna get me this time. No. Look, look, it's great with you. I mean, you're, you're... You push my buttons, I admit that. But, I mean, do we go out? Do we go to dinner? No. We do it. Period! But you gotta send me these letters, and you, you leave me these messages, you call my office! Did I ask you to call my office? Jeez, Janet. Did I ask you to come to Chicago? Huh? Okay, Okay, maybe I'm partly to blame, you know. But this... This has gotta stop. I mean, this whole thing has become sick! I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. [EXHALES] Oh, man, I should have stopped this thing a long time ago. [EXHALES] Janet... [EXHALES] The big thing that I wanted to tell you is... [SIGHS] I'm engaged. I'm getting married. Oh, man. I feel like the world's biggest... [SIGHS] This is why women think men are pigs, right? I didn't wanna hurt you. I mean, when you first came here, you seemed like you needed someone, and... Okay, I'm a pig, all right? Let's just leave it at that. It was me. It was my fault. I'm sorry. I never expected it to work out this way. [BIRDS CALLING] [LAUGHS] It's all right, Brett. I understand. I do. Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] KATHLEEN: Yes, I care what my husband thinks. BRETT: Doug and Leslie's part, right? I think I'd like to find somebody totally different and special. Oh.Ow! Hey, you okay?GIRL: Yeah. You all right? Let me give you a hand.Thanks. You okay? Yeah, yeah. Just she reminded me of someone. CAB DRIVER: You getting out, miss? Miss? [LINE RINGING] KATHLEEN: [ON PHONE] Hello? Hi.[CHUCKLES] Hi, darling. Guess what, I found a caterer for the party. Brett? Hello. Yeah. Hi. Darling, you're not supposed to work late anymore. You're married to an heiress. Oh. Well, if you have to. [DOORBELL DINGS] Um... Just a sec, okay, there's the bell. Hang on. Brett. Hi, honey. It's somebody from the neighborhood welcome wagon, or something. She has a gift basket. Yeah, it's really very sweet. Uh... Well. I... I better go. All right, but not too late. I don't want you exhausted when you get home. Mmm-hmm, yeah. Love you, too. All right, bye. Uh... My husband. You have a beautiful home. Thank you. I wish all of this were mine. Er... We... We just moved in. I know. Kathleen? Honey? Kathleen? KATHLEEN: Oh. [KATHLEEN GROANING] Hey, there. Hey, must have fallen asleep. What time is it? Where you been? Working, where else? Still don't see why I can't go. Darling, I told you. I just wanna, you know... I know, I know. It's a bachelor's rat-hole. But, how disgusting can it be? You're awfully secretive about this cabin of yours. Well, you know, it's my secret bachelor pad. Uh-huh. Look, let me just get it all straightened out, come back tomorrow. We'll spend the whole day up there. Okay?Promise? Mmm-hmm. [BRETT MOANS] See you tomorrow.Tomorrow, baby. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [VACUUM CLEANER RUNNING] [DOORBELL BUZZING] [DOORBELL BUZZING] [BUZZING CONTINUES] No, no. He is cleaning out his secret hideaway. [CHUCKLES] Probably getting rid of the naughty magazines. No, no, brunch would be nice. All right, I'll see you tomorrow then. You too, mother. Goodnight. [DOOR CREAKING] Brett? Brett, is that you? [DOOR CREAKING] [BIRDS CALLING] [ALARM BEEPING] [DOORBELL DINGING] [BEEPING CONTINUES] [DOORBELL DINGING] [BEEPING CONTINUES] Kathleen? Kathleen? [BEEPING STOPS] [GASPING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Well, this is a nice surprise. What's wrong? Brett...What is it? What?It's Kathleen. What? Where is...Don't go up there. [BREATHING RAPIDLY] Kathleen? Kathleen! Oh... Oh, my God! [SHOUTS] [CRYING] Brett? Winpoint, Wisconsin? I... We have a cabin... I went up there for some cleaning. And you were there the whole night? With anyone? Did anyone see you? No. Oh, I, uh... I got gas, uh, I got a tire repaired at the Winpoint gas station, yesterday afternoon. Saturday p.m. Filled up. Your wife wear a wedding band? An engagement ring too. Would she have taken them off? Have them cleaned?No... We just got married. Why would she do that? I mean, it was inscribed with her name, and our wedding date. I'm sorry to put you through this Mr. Becker, but we have to do this. We found this in your wife's hand. Did it belong to her? Holy... Oh, my God! What have I done? Oh, Kathleen, what have I done? Janet Flanders? Janet Flanders? Janet Flanders, would you come with us, please? OFFICER: Right hand, please. Left. All right, let's go. Don't worry, this must be some kind of misunderstanding. I'm sure I'll be back this afternoon. DETECTIVE MARCUS: You're under arrest for the murder of Kathleen Becker. You have the right to remain silent. EVELYN: Fenley.Yeah. I don't wanna hear any more about you having some so-called confession from my client. I have advised her against confessing. I find it unduly prejudices the jury. Oh, so you are taking it. Why would you do that, Evelyn? This is a slam dunk, we've already established her at the scene. So you say. I say, a woman has been unjustly accused of murder. Uh-uh. I've seen your girl. Just tell me, what can you possibly do for her? You're not gonna be able to make an issue out of this one. And if you plead insanity, we'll make an issue out of it. Who said anything about insanity? Well, she was pretty clearly obsessed with Becker. [LAUGHING] Oh, you guys. You just love to think we're all out there obsessing about you all the time. Straight out of that self-flattering, predictable, over-taxed, over-heated imagination. Oh, Evelyn, it's not gonna work on me. We've got Janet over-heated, all right, in a crime of passion. Barry, Barry. Murder, by definition, is a crime of passion. Oh.Excuse me. The question is who's the passionate one? Wait, hold on a second. You think she's innocent. As a newborn babe. JANET: Then, after I did the dishes I went for a drive up Lake Shore. And you still don't remember where you were going? Well, it's really strange, but... I don't know. I think if I stopped somewhere I probably would have remembered that. What is the last thing you do remember clearly? Coming back along Lake Michigan. Mmm-hmm. I remember the city lights. I remember thinking how pretty it was. That it was like one of those postcards. And then, I went home, um, I parked my car. Oh, I... I was gonna wash my hair, but I was really tired. I remember being very tired. And then I went to bed.Hmm... And Sunday? And Sunday I started my needlepoint. And that's all you remember. Uh-huh. [SIGHING] Okay. By the way, um... Did you kill Kathleen Becker? Oh, no. I could never do something like that. I'm not that kind of person. No. Janet, are you in love with Brett? I think I still am. Yes. How is he? Is he okay? Poor thing, he must be suffering terribly. Um... Would you tell him that I'm thinking about him? And... And that I miss him. [LAUGHING] I'd never been engaged before Brett. In Cedar Falls, you know, all the girls there, they'd end up marrying they're high school boyfriends, but I didn't wanna get trapped like that. What about Chicago? Did you do a lot of dating here? Oh, no. I came here to be with Brett. So, he... He asked you to come. Of course. He said he missed me much too much to let me languish in Cedar Falls. [CHUCKLING ] That's how he put it. Languish... So when was it that you became engaged? Oh, I'll never forget that day. It was the happiest day of my whole life. It was a Saturday, and... And Brett took me up to his cabin. And it had to be just the most beautiful day anyone could imagine. And then, when he popped the question, he made me so happy. So very, very happy. JANET: [ON RECORDER] It was a Saturday, and... And Brett took me up to his cabin. And it had to be just the most beautiful day anyone could imagine. And then, when he popped the question, he made me so happy. So very, very happy. I remember I almost had to pinch myself to make sure it was real. Oh... How does the defendant plead? The defendant pleads not guilty, by reason of insanity. If Mrs. McGinnis is so sure that her client is innocent how can she possibly object to sodium amobarbital? I mean, it's nothing but an organic lie detector. Either she has amnesia or she doesn't... Because, in an amnesiac state... BARRY: No, besides, the risk is minimal. The risk is major, of profound neurological damage. The probability is low... No, no, no, no. It is my opinion that the young lady is no more than a liar. What the amobarbital will do is break down the lies and bring us to the truth. My daughter is not a liar. If she said she didn't kill anyone, she didn't. And if it takes some drug to prove it, then... I just think, we don't have any choice. She couldn't have, not with the values she has. Not our Janet. Let me just finish this little bit. Will it hurt? I don't think you'll even notice. JANET: 81... 80... 79... 78... 77... 76... 75... 74... 73... 72... 71... 70... Would you describe your time in high school as happy? I guess. I mean, as happy as anyone is. How happy were you in high school? And what about boyfriends? Oh, I had bunches. They were always calling, or coming over. DOCTOR: So, you were one of the popular girls? Yes. I guess I was. Yes, I'd have to say, I was one of the most popular. Going along the shore drive, I take the exit. Which exit? Lake Forest. DOCTOR: Then where'd you go? Where'd you drive to, Janet? To Brett's. I go to see Brett. I get out of the car, I'm knocking on his door. And then... Where are you Janet? Do you know where you are? Yes. Yes, I'm close to Brett. DOCTOR: Or Brett's wife? Are you close to Kathleen? Where's Brett's wife? Where is Mrs. Becker? With him, right beside him. He has his arm around... Yes, he has his arm around her. We're together... Who's together? Mr. and Mrs. Becker. Come on. Come on. Come on. Brett and me. We're making love. He wants me so badly. He takes me manfully in his arms, unashamed of his need. His love is for me alone, as it was always meant to be. He's mine, mine always. He'll do anything for me. But he pumped in enough of that stuff to cure Alzheimer's. And she's still blocking. That gives me the creeps. EVELYN: No. No. No, no, no, no, no. There is another possibility. Another reason why she can't remember. There were a total of 119 entrance wounds, randomly distributed across the torso, back and neck. Seventy six of these were severe enough to cause internal hemorrhaging, with extensive vital organ damage. And one blow, which severed the aorta, and nearly snapped the fourth and fifth dorsal vertebrae, would in and of itself have been fatal. [ALL EXCLAIMING] And would you characterize these wounds as especially heinous? In my years as a coroner, I have never seen a body so savagely brutalized. The number, and the depth of the wounds, the strength or fury required would be extreme. On the knife, no. There were no fingerprints, but the handle had been wiped clean. Ah, I see. Wiped clean. And what did you notice about Kathleen Becker's left hand? Ah... There was a pale area on the ring finger where, um, a wedding or engagement ring would have been. BARRY: Both of which were missing. Now, what did this discovery suggest to you, detective? That it could have been a robbery, or made to look like robbery. Was anything else taken from the victim's person, or... Or the house? No, sir. Nothing. I see. Um... This charm bracelet. [JINGLES] People's two. Now, where was this found? In the victim's left hand, clutched. A bracelet just like this one.Objection. Withdrawn. I withdraw, Your Honor, no more questions. Well, they all got to see it. EVELYN: In fact, detective, these charm bracelets are pretty common, aren't they? I wouldn't know. Well, anyone could buy one in this same style. Including Janet Flanders, getting a new one. Including Janet Flanders. Or, someone else. Especially someone who well knew that Janet Flanders wore a bracelet exactly like this one. For example, Brett Becker.Objection. The defense is testifying. That is ludicrous speculation. Well, I withdraw. [MURMURING] Oh, uh, detective, one more thing. Brett Becker stopped at a gas station, late in the afternoon. Ken's Corner Service in Winpoint. He stopped to fill up and get a tire fixed. We verified that. We got his credit card receipt. To fill up. To fill up his tank? Barry, what is she talking about?EVELYN: Thank you, detective. This has nothing to do with me. What... She asked me to follow a silver land rover, so I did. To a house in 24 Hidden Glen. I saw him there, get off with his wife. And then what did your fare do? Uh... Just watched Mr. and Mrs. Becker. Well, the house really. Didn't say a thing. Sat there for, like, a half hour, uh... I didn't mind, the meter was running. And what night was that, sir? That was the 6th. Two nights before the murder. And your fare was... Her. Miss Flanders, there. I believe Miss Flanders to be obsessional in the extreme, to the point of erotomania. Goodness, that does sound serious. Would that mean that Becker could have seduced her, if he'd wanted to? Well, virtually anything he did would have seemed seductive. So, it would have been easy for him to take advantage of her. Well, if you want to look at it that way. Oh, I do, Doctor. I suppose so, yes. She didn't really have boyfriends in school. She was always kinda shy that way. A dreamer. Always reading, off in her own world. She used to go to the shows by herself an awful lot. And... And with her friends. She had lots of friends. So, she was well liked. People always said how nice she was, your average American girl, with a normal girl's dreams. To find the right man, be happy. You weren't having an affair with her? Wasn't what you'd call an affair. I mean, we weren't involved. I saw her, now and then. Now and then means once a week, twice a week? A month. Once, twice, three times a month. And when you got together twice, three times a month, what did you do? Come on, Mr. Becker. Did you get together to talk politics? To play chess? Crochet? What?[CROWD LAUGHING] To, um...Hmm? I didn't... What? To be intimate. I'm sorry. To be intimate? Is that a euphemism for having sex? Mr. Becker? Yes.Yes. It means, to have sex. So it was, uh... What do you guys say? A sex thing.[ALL MURMURING] A sex thing. And not, as far as you were concerned, a romance thing. No. Never.EVELYN: Never. And did your fiance, with whom you presumably did have a romance thing... Did she ever know about Janet? Did you ever tell her about your sex thing? Not really, no. Well, why spoil a good thing? And what about Janet? Did you even bother to tell her that you were engaged? Engaged long before she even came to Chicago? I mean, did you even mention Kathleen to her? I mentioned her. I told Miss Flanders that I...Miss Flanders? Oh, come, come, Mr. Becker, it's not like you never met her before. You carried on a long, intimate relationship with her. Is that what you called her in bed? Miss Flanders?Objection. "Oh... Miss Flanders, don't stop, don't stop." Your Honor...JUDGE: Counselor, really... I'm sorry. Withdrawn. So when did you finally tell Janet about your wife-to-be? Uh... You... You can call her Janet. I told her at this... This kind of a picnic thing she put together. In your private cabin, I believe. Hmm? And that was the day you finally broke it off with her. Saturday, March 18th, was it? Yes. How long was that before you wedding day? Mr. Becker, I...It was one week. One whole week. Oh, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. To make time for the wedding, gotta take a break from the mistress. [ALL EXCLAIMING] Your wife was very wealthy, wasn't she, Mr. Becker? Her personal net worth runs something like $10 million, and her family hundreds of millions. When did she write you into her will? When did Kathleen Becker write you into her will? March 16th, is that correct? And the sole beneficiary is... That wasn't my idea. Kathleen wanted me to be... Answer the question.All right! I was. The sole beneficiary. The sole beneficiary. That means the one who gets all the dough. [INAUDIBLE] Do you recognize this, Mr. Becker? It's Miss Flander's charm bracelet. I mean, it's the one that the police found in my wife's... In Kathleen's hand.Yeah, of course you know it, intimately. Intimately enough to buy an exact copy. Objection, speculation. Sustained. EVELYN: Mr. Becker, do you know what happened to your wife's engagement and wedding rings? They were taken by Miss Flanders, to make it look like a robbery. Pretty sick. EVELYN: I agree with you. Pretty sick, and amateurish, taking those rings. Whoever did take them, that is. Do you really believe that Janet Flanders murdered your wife? Obviously. Then why, do you suppose, it is, that under sodium amobarbital, where 95% of all subjects given this drug tell the truth, the most recognized method of penetrating amnesia, that she has no recollection whatsoever of even going into your house, much less committing some indelibly heinous murder? Are you asking me this question?Yeah... Well, I think, obviously because she's off. She's unbalanced. Unbalanced? Uh-huh. Well, that would be convenient. But, there is another possibility. Maybe, just maybe, Janet Flanders can't remember the murder because she didn't do it. Of course, she did it. I... I mean, look at her. She's not right. I mean, who else would wanna kill Kathleen? Who else? You. What? That's... That's...Relevance, Your Honor, where is this heading? You married way above your station Mr. Becker. A corporate insurance broker, who not only gets himself an heiress but gets himself written into the will. And a divorce won't do it because you had to sign a prenuptial agreement, giving you next to zilch. This is crazy. She can't say that. Can she say that?Your Honor, I'm completely lost here. Where exactly is this heading?Look at Janet Flanders. Look at her. Does this woman have the strength to stab someone 119 times? To sever the aorta? To snap vertebrae? [LAUGHS] I don't think so. But you do Mr. Becker.Oh, please. Your Honor, the counsel is harassing the witness. Counselor.Just as easily as you could have placed a copy of Janet's bracelet in you dead wife's hand, easily as you could take advantage of a young girl from Iowa, one who you set up to take the fall for you. Oh, come on. Please. In fact, began to set up from the moment you met her. Your Honor, I'm not on trial here.Mrs. McGinnis. A girl, so desperately in love...JUDGE: Mrs. McGinnis. ...that we might almost believe that she could kill your new bride. Almost. But, not quite.Mrs. McGinnis. At least not as easily as you, Mr. Becker, who had millions... Your Honor, as Becker has so aptly pointed out.Order. Order. He, in fact, is not on trial here. Further outbursts from anyone will result in their removal from this court.Your Honor... Including counsels for the defense or the prosecution. I have only one more question, Your Honor. If it is a question.It is, for the defendant. BARRY: Your Honor.I mean, Mr. Becker. According to the police report from the crime scene, your jeep, when you returned to your house Sunday, had only one quarter of a tank. Yet, your credit card record shows that you filled up the afternoon before. So, if you spent the entire Saturday night in your cabin, my question is, what happened to the other three quarters of a tank, if, as you say, you went nowhere? I... I did go for a short drive. A short drive? A short drive? Yes.You went for a long drive, from your cabin back to your house in Hidden Glen, No, I didn't. I didn't go anywhere near Hidden Glen. I... I went to see Janet. [PEOPLE MURMURING] I... [STUTTERING] I... I... I wanted to... I wanted to see if she was okay. I just, I wanted to talk to her, you know. I... I went straight to her place. But she wasn't home. She wasn't there, she was out. Don't you see, she was out. I swear, I swear. I just wanted to, you know, see if she was okay, you know. I felt badly. I just wanted to see if she was all right. [MOUTHING] It was her. It was her. It was her. Lieutenant. Blood.Hmm... As from time immemorial, when it comes to love and sex, it is the man who is believed and the woman who takes the fall. And then everybody says, she got what she deserved. [SCOFFS] Well, justice has tipped the scales the other way. And for once, it is the man who got what he deserved. As D. H. Lawrence once said, "Sex is the one thing you shouldn't swindle, "yet it's the center "of the worst swindling of all, "emotional swindling." Evelyn, the police were saying the blood on his jacket matches his wife's, think that'll be enough to convict him? Would have been enough to convict her. What about Janet, what happens now? Does she have any plans? Oh, I think her plans are just, you know, get on with her life. She'll put this behind her, and hopefully be able to move on, with eyes a little wider open. JANET: My dearest Brett, I stopped by to see you yesterday, but I guess you weren't feeling well, so I decided it was better not to disturb you. I know I must be in your thoughts, so I wanted to dash of this note to let you know I'm thinking about you, too. So much has happened since the last time I saw you. Guess what? I'm moving to Los Angeles. Pokey old me, the girl from Cedar Falls, is on her way to the glamor capital of the world. Yeah, I know it's a big move. And it does mean I won't be able to see you as often as we'd like, but, I'm gonna write to you every week. And as soon as I get settled in, I'm gonna send you pictures of my new place and the new me. I miss you, too. But I truly believe that all that really matters is that we know in our hearts, we have each other. And that you'll always be there for me, whenever I need you. [SCREAMING] PRISONER 1: Shut up.PRISONER 2: What's your problem? [GROANING] JANET: Well, here I am, in a new city. Starting a whole new life. It's just so exciting because I know there are just so many possibilities out there. And I have a feeling. I just have a feeling, something special's gonna happen. MAN: Excuse me. Is anyone sitting here? No. Just saw you sitting here by yourself... [INAUDIBLE]
