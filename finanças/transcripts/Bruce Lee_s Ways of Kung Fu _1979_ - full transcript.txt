(wind whooshing) (soft music) (soft music) (dramatic orchestral music) (dramatic music) (woman clapping) (man laughing) - [Narrator] Kung Chen, the master of the castle of The Devil's Disciples, has gathered 18 girls together. Each possess unique beauty and different deadly styles of kung fu. - [Man] Listen, they trap their rivals by seducing them. And then they kill them. When you too improve, I want you to kill this Kung, right? - Yes, I will do this, teacher. - Let me kill him now, please, teacher. - No way, you're not yet ready! - (laughing) So you are the famous Southern King. And you want to come and fight with me. (laughing) - Kung Chen! Now you're in trouble. It will be revenge for all the people you killed! - (laughs) You're the one who will die, not me! (laughing) - You think? (all shouting) (fabric tearing) - [Both] Sir. (man shouting) (man screaming) (suspenseful music) (all shouting) (man grunting) (all grunting) (woman shouting) (man grunting) - Damn you, bitches! Tell me how the Southern King got in here today! (man grunting) (suspenseful music) - The master is very upset with you all. Why weren't there any guards on the post? You should not have been absent. By our law, you should all be executed. Now I am the one responsible for punishing you. This time I won't. - [Fighters] Thank you, Miss Gim. - Although you are safe from death, you must all repent. (dramatic music) Let the punishment begin. (dramatic music) (all shouting) - Stop it. (women groaning) - You all repent? (tranquil flute music) - Master. - What's that in your hand? - Dragon's hair. - Dragon's hair? (dramatic music) What's going on? - Kung Chen is bad news! He has the darkest heart of all human beings. So I choose you as leader. To take care of Kung Chen. - But his kung fu is much better than all of ours put together. (all laughing) - Let's all drink together! (laughs) The wine's very good, isn't it? - Wonderful. (dramatic music) (man groans) - What have you done to us? (man gagging) (man laughing) - Help. - You'll soon be dead. So all my troubles have left me now. (laughing) (men grunting) (man groaning) (dramatic music) - Your parents have both been killed by Kung Chen and his crowd. So now I must look after you and your sister also. - We must fight back and kill them all, master. - We must hold on for awhile. First of all, you must spend time to learn the style of Master White Cloud. - Master White Cloud? - You must go with the Dragon and the other girl also. So that you'll be able to mend the broken pendant. (dramatic music) - What a way to make money. There have been over 700 so far. (rhythmic drum music) - Put it down here. (dramatic music) Here is your money. - Thank you. (rhythmic drum music) (all grunting) (gong ringing) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - [Woman] 2 Watch out, someone's intruding, take your positions! (suspenseful music) (arrows whirring) Well now, who are you? - Why have you come here? - Come for revenge. (grunting) (man grunting) (dramatic music) (all grunting) (Kung laughing) (man groaning) (man groaning) - Who are you then? - What do you care? - Quiet! - [Kung] Stop it! - Sir. (Kung laughing) - I know all around here. A lot of people want me dead. And what is your reason? - Revenge. - You cannot even fight my daughters. (all grunting) (man gagging) (Kung chuckles) (dramatic music) Treat him like the others and starve him to death! - [Both] Yes, sir. (dramatic music) (woman yawns) - Move over. - Who is it?! (suspenseful music) Halt! (all grunting) (all grunting) (man groaning) (all grunting) (metal clanging) (dramatic music) (man grunting) - [Woman] I'm your friend. Get out of here! Now! - Thank you for saving my life. - [Woman] (chuckling) You talk too much. - I want to know who you are. (man grunting) - [Woman] You must leave here. Right now. And never come back. Ever. (dramatic music) (woman grunting) (dramatic music) - You just betrayed us! (dramatic music) (metal ricocheting) (man grunting) (man grunting) (man grunting) (all grunting) (all grunting) (woman laughing) (metal ricocheting) (water splashing) (all grunting) (man grunting) (dramatic music) (woman breathing heavily) (woman sighing) - Why did you save him? I don't understand. You know what happens when you betray the master? You will die mercilessly! (soft music) (Kung chuckling) - You're my favorite girl. And the teacher of my group. (laughing) (Kung laughing) (woman laughing) (arrows whirring) (suspenseful music) (laughs) Excellent, excellent! (dramatic music) - (laughs) We've got a live one here! (suspenseful music) (all grunting) (man groaning) (dramatic music) (all grunting) (man groaning) (dramatic music) - You bitch, you betrayed me! I wanna know the reason why before she- - [Woman] I'll see to it. - I must find out why a woman like her, in such a position, would betray her master! - I'll make her talk. (woman gasping) Tell me exactly, why did you save him? I warn you, you'd better give us some information or we'll really make you suffer. (flute music) (dramatic music) - My boy, you're the first person I've ever seen come out of that cave alive. - Mister, did you save me? - It was just your luck. (man groaning) (soft orchestral music) I collected over 700 bodies from in there and only you, only you have survived. (suspenseful music) (chuckles) Don't be afraid. They only ask me to collect dead bodies. You can rest here as long as you like. You'll be okay. (dramatic synthesizer music) (birds chirping) (man snoring) - Huh? You wanna steal my thing? Let's go! What's wrong, what are you staring at? (chuckles) It seems you've got quite a lot of money. - Master White Cloud, do you know him? - White Cloud, never heard of the man. Better be off! - Thanks a million. (man chuckles) (dramatic music) - Listen to me, you young fool! Don't you know this place is very dangerous? I've been here for a very long time! I made lots of coffins for fools like you. Do wise up, young man. Look at him. (dramatic music) You know what happened to him, don't you? He died at the hands of those 18 damn girls. I would never dream of trying to become a hero. You can't match Kung's girls, let alone him! Hear me out. I don't wanna make a coffin for you. Don't come back to this evil place! Get out while you still can! (woman moaning) (dramatic synth music) She used to be leader here, but she made a big mistake. She betrayed her master and now she awaits death. (woman moaning) Mistress. - Is she dead yet? - Very soon, I'll put her in a coffin when it's over. - Nice one. (man chuckles) (gentle orchestra music) - She won't last long. - Is there any way we can save her? - Not a chance. Every coffin leaving here is tested by piercing it with spears. (dramatic orchestral music) - Please think of a way. - The only way is for her to keep silent. - We gotta do something. - I'll try, don't you worry. I will try. You take care. (light orchestral music) (suspenseful music) - Stop! Put it down. Hmmm. Hah! (suspenseful music) Move on. (man groaning) (suspenseful music) - Who made such a noise to disturb my siesta? - It's nothing to do with you. - Young people should be more polite. - [Man] You talk too much, old man. - I can't sit here watching you push people around, you young puppy! - You wanna die? (men grunting) - Take that for a lesson. - Old man. (man grunting) (dramatic music) (man laughing) (men grunting) (dramatic music) (man groaning) - Old man, you okay? (waves crashing) (loud banging) (dramatic music) (flute music) - [White Cloud] My name is White Cloud. I came here to kill Kung Chen, the devil. But now I am blind. I hope you can take over for me when you've learned my technique. - Because you saved me, I cursed your blindness, I am so sorry. - Fool, we all live in this world. We should help each other. - How can I carry on with your mission? - Of course you can. Our kung fu technique depends on faith and style. - I understand you, master. - Young man, listen to me. There's a book for you to study when you're better. - Thank you, master. - I hope you're the right man to take this on this time. (dramatic music) - Are you the first to come? - Yes, why do you ask? - Why not? Master Kung asked us to check everyone who comes here. - I'm looking for someone. - And who are you looking for? - I'm looking for a relative who happens to have a hotel near here. - A relative? - Yes. Do you know where the hotel is around here? - A hotel? Yes, there's one not far from here, come on! Now you wait here quietly. (door slams) - Someone's coming with a challenge. So we must check every stranger. - [Both] Yes, sir! - Friend. Why are you here? They must suspect you of something. - There's nothing to talk about. - Hmm. Well then, you're not a common traveler, huh? - Well I doubt very much if in actual fact you're a common traveler either. - Maybe, mate. - You're no common traveler, I know you. You're a kung fu man, huh? I know it by the looks of you. - That's it. (flute music) - What on Earth was that noise? - [Man] Better go take a look. (men grunting) (flute music) - Why are you here? - Because I am hungry. - You just came in here to eat something? - That's just one of the reasons I'm here, all right? (men grunting) (suspenseful music) (glass shatters) (man grunting) - (laughs) You shouldn't attack from the back. (men grunting) (lighthearted orchestra music) (man gagging) (man groaning) (birds chirping) - Where are you? Where are you? - Dragon, your only weakness was that you didn't have the strength. - Try a little harder. - Dragon, how are you? I've brought you something to eat. (dramatic music) You know you need strength for your body. Now try some of this. (dramatic music) (men grunting) - So you're the one called White Cloud. - That's right. I guess you're Kung Chen's girl. (both grunting) (all grunting) - Master! Wake up! What happened? (dramatic music) - Who the hell was that guy? (man laughing) (dramatic music) (man shouting) (all chattering) - Hey listen! I'm now selling my life! Anyone wanna buy it? - How much? - Very cheap for you. - All right then, let's gamble for it. - I have a hard head. - All right then, we'll see just how hard. - Very well, but please pay first. Now my life is in your hands. So you'd better do your best. Do your best, will you? (man laughing) - Let's go for it then, you silly bastard. (mallet thudding) (light guitar music) - I told you, didn't I? (man grunting) (man shouting) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, you just saved my life. I'm totally indebted to you, thank you, thank you. - I didn't save you, you just continue about your own business. (man chuckling) - Wait, wait! (jazzy guitar music) Oh. (chuckling) I never met such a strange man. Why wouldn't he let me work for him? Here, here. - [Man] Bloody beggar. - You oughta watch your language. - Something wrong? - Shut up! I'm talking to my master. - I am the master's bodyguard. - Here, are you looking for a fight? - You oughta be taught the meaning of fighting! (man grunting) - You bastard, I'll kill you! (man grunting) You turkey, why don't you come out and fight! - [Man] You talking to me? You crazy? I'm faster than you. (laughs) - Well you're not too bad. (man chuckling) - If you follow my master, say. - Sure. Sure, come down first. - Watch your head next time. See, I'm not too bad. You can even do things by him. - What you mean? - Do you wanna work for him? - All right. (dramatic orchestral music) - Black and white evils. - [Both] Yes! - (chuckling) They're looking for fighting experts. Why don't we try, huh? - All right, let's go. Come on. (dramatic music) - [Man] Bring me some food. - Yes. - Huh? Hey, Dragon! - My friend. - Dragon! Dragon! Where have you been all this time? What are you up to, what have you been doing? - I'm all right. I was beaten up by Kung. And I was saved by a young girl, but now I must take revenge for everything. - Who are you then? - We want a job. - You want kung fu experts? - (laughs) You two just don't look right. (dramatic music) - Well now, what do you think of them? - Not much to me. - That's what I think. - Let us in. - Come on. - Tell them to wash our clothes. - [Both] Yes, mistress. - He's crazy, why can't we see (indistinct)? - Yeah, our kung fu's pretty good- - Wait please, wait! Our boss might hire you. - Well, we made it! - Great! I knew we would! (laughs) (dramatic music) (lighthearted synthesizer music) (man laughing) (man laughing) - Ahhh! - (chuckling) Come on! (dramatic music) - I saved you because I saw your pendant. I have one just like you. So I feel there's some connection. - Our fathers have been killed by Kung Chen. - We must fight so we can take revenge for them. - [Kim] It's difficult. His castle is fully armed. And he has 17 expert kung fu girls around. - [Man] The only thing we can do now is to join up. - Come here, shhh. Come on, let's do them all a really big favor and we'll surprise them. - I definitely remember that the way to kill Kung Chen is to follow the method of White Cloud. - The most important thing we need is for Miss Kim to lead us into the castle, is that right? - That's right. I know the road very well. You can both follow me through. To get to Kung Chen. Let's take our revenge immediately. (jazzy synthesizer music) - Stop! Who are you? - Oh just a young girl. - What do you want? - Just to bring you a little wine. (both laughing) - Sounds like a good idea, honey. - Huh? Oh. - Your figure's not bad, but your face is just a little fat. - (sighing) How endearing. (man groaning) - What's going on? - Let me show you a little something. (man chuckles) (men grunting) (glass shatters) (man grunting) - Watch out for your dress! Come on, let's get inside. - Uh, hey. - Who is it? Fat girl, what do you want? - [Man] Hey, look at that body. - You haven't answered my question yet. - I'm so lonely. I came here to find somebody. Place from far away told me to go. - [Man] Really? Have you found anyone yet? (man giggles) (tense music) (man chuckles) (man grunting) What's under your skirt? (man groaning) It's your last day on Earth! I don't know what it is that you're looking for around here. - (chuckles) Let's see who goes to Hell. (both laughing) - Okay, sonny boy. (men grunting) (suspenseful music) (glass shatters) (men grunting) (man groaning) (man groaning) (dramatic music) - Bastard! (men grunting) (man screaming) (glass shatters) (man groaning) (dramatic music) - You two are heroes. The greatest there are. (birds sQuawking) - It's dangerous here. We best be very careful. - Okay. - All right. You two follow me. - Right. - We best split up, you two go separately. Okay? - Good idea. (man grunting) (suspenseful music) (arrows whirring) (tense music) (water splashing) (water splashing) (metal clanging) (man shouting) (both grunting) (man groaning) (man shouting) (all groaning) (all grunting) (suspenseful music) (electric sparks zapping) (all grunting) (dramatic music) (all shouting) (arrows whirring) (man screaming) - Huh? (man laughing) - So you finally came here to die. (man grunting) (loud crashing) - [Both] Huh? (suspenseful music) (men grunting) (gong rings) (all shouting) (suspenseful music) (both grunting) (bone cracking) (man screaming) (man shouting) (dramatic music) (thunder booming) (man groaning) (man shouting) (man gagging) (man groaning) (somber orchestra music) (man sobbing) (soft music)
