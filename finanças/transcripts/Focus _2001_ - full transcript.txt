YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE ANYMORE WITHOUT SOMETHING HAPPENING. JUST GO TO ANOTHER PLACE, LULLY. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? WE'RE GOING HOME. NO! I WANNA GO TO ANOTHER PLACE! I WANNA GO TO ANOTHER PLACE! STOP THAT! WHAT... LET ME OUT! LULLY! JUST LET ME OUT! STOP THE CAR! STOP IT! I'M NOT GOING HOME! STOP IT! WILL YOU CALM DOWN? I WANNA FIND ANOTHER PLACE. NO! I'M NOT GOING THROUGH THAT AGAIN. AND I DON'T WANT YOU INSULTED EITHER. TURN AROUND! THEY'RE ALL RESTRICTED HOTELS ALONG HERE. IT'LL BE THE SAME NO MATTER WHERE WE GO. THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO TREAT PEOPLE LIKE THAT. GOT THE RIGHT TO DO ANYTHING THEY WANT. BUT THEY'RE WRONG, AND YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD HIM THAT! WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HIM? TELL THEM WHAT, GERT? TELL THEM WHAT? IF PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE THAT ATTITUDE WITH YOU, YOU CAN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING! WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN TELL THEM? THEY PULL THAT ON ME AND I TELL 'EM WHAT I AM. NOBODY MAKES A JEW OUTTA ME AND GETS AWAY WITH IT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? THERE'S A-A LITTLE STATE PARK UP THE ROAD HERE. WE'LL HAVE LUNCH. WE'LL SIT BY THE LAKE. I DON'T WANNA SIT BY THE LAKE. I CANNOT GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN TODAY! NOW STOP IT! DO JEWS EAT CLAMS? NO SHELLFISH. HAVE YOU DECIDED? YES. CLAMS. MY WIFE WILL HAVE CLAMS. AND I'LL HAVE CLAMS TOO. A LARGE ORDER OF CLAMS FOR TWO. THAT'S AN ORDER OF CLAMS FOR TWO, SIR. OKAY. ANYTHING ELSE? NO, NOT JUST YET. WE'LL SEE AS WE GO. OKAY. WE'LL TURN AROUND, WE'LL DRIVE BACK DOWN THE ROAD FOR A COUPLE OF MILES. WE'LL FIND ANOTHER PLACE. MUST BE ANOTHER PLACE. OKAY. I STILL THINK YOU SHOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING TO HIM. NO! NO! THAT'S TOO COLD! I DON'T CARE. ALL RIGHT, I CALL. TWO OF A KIND. FULL HOUSE. OKAY. OH, OH. THOSE ARE PERFECT. WAIT! IT'S USUALLY OPEN ON SUNDAY. SOMETHING MUST'VE HAPPENED. HELLO? MOTHER, WE'RE HOME. OH, HELLO, DEAR. I'LL GO PUT THE CAR AWAY. ALL RIGHT. HI. DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME? YES, WE DID. WE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME. SO I FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED. YOUR MOTHER TOLD ME THAT FINKELSTEIN GOT IN A FIGHT WITH SOME GUY... OVER THAT KID WHO SELLS NEWSPAPERS ON SUNDAY. WAS HE HURT? NO. THEY FELL AGAINST A WINDOW AND IT CRACKED. SHE SAID SHE SAW IT FROM HERE. THE WHOLE BLOCK WAS WATCHING. SHE TOLD ME ABOUT FRED. THE TWO OF YOU USED TO GET TOGETHER AND TALK, VISIT WITH EACH OTHER IN HIS CELLAR. YOU DON'T DO IT ANYMORE? MM-HMM. AND HE'S A UNION CRUSADER? I KNOW HE'S A UNION CRUSADER. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT, LULLY. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT HE INVITED YOU TO A MEETING AND YOU DIDN'T GO. AND ABOUT THE GARBAGE CANS. I ASKED FRED ABOUT THE GARBAGE CANS. AND WHAT DID HE SAY? HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. OH, LULLY! THAT'S PART OF THEIR TACTIC. FIRST WITH THE GARBAGE CAN, AND THEN THEY BLOW OUT A WINDOW OR TWO. NOT MY WINDOW, THEY'RE NOT. - WHO ARE THEY? - I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE. HE'S HAVING A MEETING. OH, EXCUSE ME. IS THIS 144? NO, JUST NEXT DOOR. THANKS A LOT. COME INSIDE. THERE'S SOME THINGS I DIDN'T TELL YOU. AND MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE, BUT THERE ARE THINGS YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME EITHER. WHAT THINGS? WHAT HAVEN'T I TOLD YOU? ABOUT THE GARBAGE CAN. AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THE UNION CRUSADERS ARE ALIVE AROUND HERE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. WE GOTTA STOP FOOLING AROUND HERE! YOU EITHER GET IN WITH FRED AND YOU JOIN THE UNION CRUSADERS, OR WE GET OUT NOW AND FAST. GET OUT OF... WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT? I JUST TOLD YOU. AND YOU HEARD ME. LOOK. I WAS OUT SHOPPING, AND I HEARD THE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THIS MEETING NEXT SATURDAY. LULLY, YOU SHOULD GO. I DON'T KNOW. ALL RIGHT, DON'T GO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO. BUT WE GET IN OR WE GET OUT. THAT'S THE ONLY CHOICE. HOW DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THE UNION CRUSADERS? - I JUST KNOW, OKAY? - HOW? THAT GUY I TOLD YOU I WORKED FOR IN HOLLYWOOD, THE DOG GROOMER... I LIVED WITH HIM, LULLY. I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE, SO I STAYED. I STAYED FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. LULLY, HE'S A UNION CRUSADER. SO I HEARD A LOT. THEN THEY STARTED BEATIN' UP ON JEWS, AND THE POLICE CAME AROUND. I'D HAD ENOUGH, SO I GOT OUT. BUT I DIDN'T GET OUT BEFORE I GOT TO KNOW THOSE PEOPLE, LULLY. THAT FAT GUY WE SAW DOWNSTAIRS, I SAW HIM IN L.A. HIS NAME'S MEL. HE'S REAL IMPORTANT WITH THE CRUSADERS, LULLY. THEY DON'T BRING HIM IN UNLESS THEY... IT'S GONNA GET REAL DANGEROUS. OKAY? THEY GOT RIFLES, THEY GOT BOMBS. FRED'S GOT RIFLES. FRED GOES HUNTING. AND REVOLVERS, LULLY? YOU GO HUNTING WITH REVOLVERS? THEY'RE DRAWING A RING AROUND US. NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS, BUT THEN WE HAVE TO MOVE RIGHT NOW. BUT WE'RE NOT JEWS! OH, LULLY, LISTEN TO ME. IT ISN'T FAIR, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHEN THEY MAKE UP THEIR MIND ABOUT WHO YOU ARE, IT'S OVER. SO YOU GO TO THE MEETING OR YOU GET OUT NOW. OH, GOD. LET'S GO. CALLAHAN PETE'S, 221 FLATBUSH. TWO MALE NEGROES, POSSIBLY JUVENILES. BOB, GOOD TO SEE YOU. EXCUSE ME. THAT'S SAVED. I'M SORRY. THERE HE IS. FATHER! FATHER! FATHER! FATHER! FATHER! FATHER! FATHER! YOU MUST BE FRED. THANKS VERY MUCH. FATHER! FATHER! FATHER! FATHER! FATHER! FATHER! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! PLEASE BE SEATED! I COME TO YOU TONIGHT, GOOD PEOPLE, IN THE TERRIBLE HEAT OF THIS DAY, TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT... AGAINST THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN PROPAGANDISTS, AND TO STAND FAST... FAST... AGAINST THE INTERNATIONALIST WARMONGERS... DETERMINED TO CRUCIFY CHRIST ALL OVER AGAIN! - STAND FAST! - YES! YES! YES! THIS IS NOT A DEMOCRACY... WHEN 95 PERCENT OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS... HAVE THEIR MINDS AND EMOTIONS AROUSED BY ONLY... FIVE PERCENT OF THESE INTERNATIONALIST WARMONGERS, WHOSE MAIN CONCERN IS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE... IN THE SERVICE OF COMMUNISM! YOU GOT THAT RIGHT! BOO! THIS IMPENDING MENACE MAKES IT NECESSARY FOR US TO SOLIDIFY... A CLOSELY WOVEN UNION CRUSADE... TO BLUDGEON THIS ASSAULT BY THESE INTERNATIONALIST BANKERS... AND THEIR WARMONGERING COMMUNIST BROTHERS! AND WE ALL KNOW WHO THEY ARE! JEWS! JEWS! NOW WE MUST BE DILIGENT IN ROOTING OUT... THESE MAGGOTS THAT FEED ON THE ULCERS OF CIVILIZATION, AND GROW FAT ON THE DOCTRINES OF ZIONIST GREED... AND MARXIST ATHEISM! WE MUST BE RESOLUTE IN DENYING THESE PARASITES... THE OPPORTUNITY TO WAX FAT... ON THE WOUNDS OF OUR PROSPERITY! BUT, BUT, BEFORE I CONTINUE, DEAR BRETHREN AND CO-PATRIOTS, BEFORE I CONTINUE, I SHOULD LIKE TO INFORM... NAY, WARN YOU... THAT THERE ARE AMONGST US TONIGHT... HOW SHALL I SAY IT? THE INTERNATIONALIST PRESS. YES! LOOK AROUND YOU! I THINK YOU KNOW HOW TO TELL A NATIONALIST FROM AN INTERNATIONALIST. I SUSPECT THESE PRESS PEOPLE WILL... GIVE US DUE ATTENTION IN THEIR NEWSPAPERS. AND WE MUST STEEL OURSELVES FOR EXCLAMATIONS OF DISSENT TONIGHT. AND SHOULD ANY SUCH DISSENT BE NOTICED, I TRUST YOU WILL RESTRAIN YOURSELVES... AND DEAL WITH ANY SUCH INDIVIDUALS AS BEFITS OUR CHRISTIAN VALUES. AMEN! AS YOU ALL KNOW, WE ARE CLOSE TO THE END OF THE MOST BRUTAL WAR IN HISTORY. A WAR TO WHICH MANY OF YOU... HAVE LOST BROTHERS, HUSBANDS, FRIENDS. AND I TELL YOU, WHEN OUR BOYS COME HOME, WE WILL RISE UP AGAINST THE MONEY-GRABBERS WHO STARTED IT! AND OUR BYWORD WILL BE ACTION! ACTION! ACTION! - ACTION! - ACTION! ACTION! ACTION! STAND UP, MISTER! NOW FRIENDS, PLEASE! PLEASE, PLEASE, SIT DOWN! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? HE DIDN'T CLAP ONCE. FOR PETE'S SAKE, I NEVER CLAP. HE'S A JEW, A SAMMY. YOU'RE OUTTA HERE! STOP IT! SIT DOWN! PLEASE GO BACK TO YOUR SEATS! PLEASE! LET US EXERCISE SOME CHRISTIAN COMPASSION. LISTEN TO ME! MY NAME IS LAWRENCE NEWMAN! MY FAMILY CAME FROM ALDWICH, ENGLAND IN 1861! ALDWICH, ENGLAND, FOR PETE'S SAKE! MY-MY ANCESTORS WERE PILGRIMS, EVEN! PROTESTANTS! PRESBYTERIANS! I... LISTEN! YOU BETTER GO HOME, MISTER. WELL, I... I... YOU HURT? NO, NO, BUT THEY'RE OUT OF THEIR MINDS. THEY'RE CRAZY! CAN'T THEY SEE? I'M NOT A HEBE! BETTER GO HOME NOW. MR. NEWMAN. CAN I HELP YOU? UH, UH, I'M ALL RIGHT. I THINK YOU'LL WANT TO TAKE YOUR JACKET OFF. IT DON'T LOOK NICE. ARE YOU GOIN' HOME? I'D LIKE TO WALK WITH YOU, IF YOU DON'T MIND MY COMPANY. I SEEN THERE WHAT HAPPENED. I FIGURE THAT THEY'LL COME TO ME ANYWAY, SO FIRST I'LL GO TO THEM. I STOOD OUTSIDE. I SEEN WHAT THEY DONE TO YOU. FIRST, I'M ASKIN' YOU TO UNDERSTAND ME. I'M... I'M AFTER INFORMATION. I AM A MAN WHO READS EVERY DAY, SEVERAL NEWSPAPERS. ALL KINDS, FROM COMMUNIST TO THE UTTERMOST REACTIONARY. IT'S MY NATURE I SHOULDN'T BE HAPPY... UNLESS I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS HOW SO MANY PEOPLE... CAN GET WORKED UP TO SUCH A PITCH ABOUT JEWS, WHEN IN THAT WHOLE HALL THERE AIN'T A PERSON WHO KNOWS HIMSELF PERSONALLY... MAYBE MORE THAN THREE JEWS TO SPEAK TO. MOST OF THEM AREN'T VERY INTELLIGENT. YEAH, BUT SOME THERE LOOK MORE INTELLIGENT THAN ME. I-I WANNA LAY THINGS OUT ON THE BOARD, MR. NEWMAN. IF YOU DON'T MIND, YOU CAN DISCUSS WITH ME. WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO GET OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD? IT ISN'T YOU, PARTICULARLY. IT IS ME PARTICULARLY. IF YOU WANT THE JEWS TO GET OUT, YOU WANT ME TO GET OUT. I DID SOMETHIN' YOU DON'T LIKE? IT ISN'T A QUESTION OF DOING SOMETHING I DON'T LIKE. YES, THEN, WHAT? YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO KNOW THIS, DO YOU? WHY, DON'T YOU WANT TO TELL ME? NO, I'LL TELL YOU IF YOU WANT. THERE'S LOTS OF REASONS PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE JEWS. UH, FOR ONE THING, THEY HAVE NO PRINCIPLES. PRINCIPLES? YES. IN BUSINESS, FOR INSTANCE, YOU'LL FIND THEM CHEATING OR TAKING ADVANTAGE. LET ME UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ME NOW? NO, NO, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU. SOME, YOU MEAN. OF COURSE I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU. THEN SOME GENTILES, NO? OF COURSE, YES. SOME GENTILES, YES. YOU EVER PUT A NICKEL IN FOR A LOCAL CALL? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THE PHONE COMPANY COULD MAKE A GOOD PROFIT CHARGING A PENNY. THIS IS A FACT FROM THE UTILITIES INVESTIGATION. THE PHONE COMPANY IS RUN AND OWNED BY GENTILES, BUT SHOULD I HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE? YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT ISN'T WHAT YOU'VE DONE. IT'S WHAT OTHERS OF YOUR PEOPLE HAVE DONE. SO, IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME, YOU DON'T SEE ME. I DON'T SEE YOU? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I MEAN WHAT I SAID. YOU LOOK AT ME AND YOU DON'T SEE ME. SO WHAT DO YOU SEE, MR. NEWMAN? I... WHAT HAPPENED? YOU'RE ALL DIRTY. I'LL WASH LATER. LAWRENCE, YOU'RE CUT! I WAS SITTING THERE WITH SOME MORON. HE STARTED YELLING AT ME. WHY? WHAT'D YOU DO? I DIDN'T DO A THING. HE-HE SAW I WASN'T APPLAUDING. I NEVER APPLAUD. YOU KNOW THAT. BUT DID YOU TELL HIM THAT? HOW CAN YOU TELL THOSE MORONS ANYTHING? THEY WENT CRAZY AND SHOVED ME OUT. SO YOU DIDN'T STAY TO THE END? THEY PUSHED ME OUT, FOR PETE'S SAKE! RIGHT. YOU SHOULD HAVE APPLAUDED. WHY? WHY SHOULD I HAVE APPLAUDED? THEY'RE ALL MORONS. TAKE CARE. OKAY, YOU TOO. GOOD NIGHT. I WANT TO SEE YOU, FRED. - WHO'S THAT? - IT'S ME. SIT DOWN A MINUTE, WILL YOU? YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED TODAY? WELL, UH, WHAT DO YOU WANT, LARRY? I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING, NOW COULD I? I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE MOLESTED AGAIN. MISTAKES HAPPEN. THEY JUST GOT EXCITED, LARRY. THEY JUST GOT EXCITED. AS EXCITED AS THEY GET WHEN THEY THROW MY GARBAGE ON MY LAWN? I TOLD YOU, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE GARBAGE ON YOUR LAWN. OH, COME ON, FRED! YOU SAW IT THE FIRST TIME, WHEN YOU WALKED YOUR DOGS BEFORE I GOT UP. BUT LET'S STOP FOOLING AROUND, ALL RIGHT? LET'S BE HONEST, ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, LARRY? I WANT MY NAME TAKEN OFF THE LIST. I KNOW YOU GUYS KEEP A LIST, AND I WANT MY NAME OFF. A MAN DOESN'T GET GARBAGE TWICE ON HIS LAWN... OR GET ATTACKED LIKE TODAY, UNLESS HE'S A JEW. AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT, FRED. I TOLD 'EM. I SAYS, THE MAN HAS BEEN A NEIGHBOR OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME. BUT THEY CLAIM THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKIN' ABOUT. AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, LARRY, I WAS MAKIN' HEADWAY UNTIL YOU BROUGHT THE MISSUS AROUND. GERTRUDE? YOU THINK SHE'S JEWISH? YOU MEAN, SHE'S NOT? NO! WHERE'D YOU EVER GET THAT IDEA? OH, GEE, I'M... I'M AWFUL SORRY, LARRY. I DIDN'T KNOW. I THOUGHT YOU'D DONE GONE AND MARRIED YOURSELF A JEW WOMAN. I'M NOT GIVING UP MY HOUSE, FRED. WHO GAVE YOU THAT IDEA? I'M TALKING, FRED, AND I'M TELLING YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I BOUGHT AND PAID FOR THAT HOUSE, AND I'M NOT GIVING IT UP! AND AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED, DON'T KID YOURSELF ABOUT ME. I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. YOU UNDERSTAND ME? I CAN TAKE PRETTY GOOD CARE OF MYSELF, SO DON'T KID YOURSELF! WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? MAYBE IT WAS ABOUT THAT WOMAN PETEY RAPED THAT NIGHT. MAYBE IT WAS ABOUT ME AND GERTRUDE. MAYBE IT WAS ABOUT FINKELSTEIN THERE, OR MRS. BLYTHE OR MRS. DEWITT. MAYBE IT WAS ABOUT WHO OF US WOULD COME OUT TO HELP EACH OTHER... IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ONE OF US, LIKE TO YOU, FOR INSTANCE. OR FRED OR FINKELSTEIN. YEAH, I'M INCLUDING HIM, LIKE I'M INCLUDING THAT WOMAN SCREAMING... WHILE PETEY RAPED HER AND NONE OF US CAME OUT TO HELP. WHAT WAS IT ABOUT, CARLSON? IT WAS ABOUT YOU AND FRED AND PETEY... AND ALL THIS GODDAMNED HATRED GOING AROUND AND AROUND US... LIKE SOME CRAZY CAROUSEL, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! THAT'S WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. ALL RIGHT? GOOD EVENING AGAIN. HOW ARE YOU? I WANTED TO ASK YOU A FEW THINGS. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IF THEY COME AFTER YOU? YOU GOT SOME DEFINITE INFORMATION THEY'RE GONNA START WITH ME? WELL, IT'S COMING, ALL RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHEN, BUT IT'S GOING TO COME. WHAT WILL YOU DO? THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL A LOUISVILLE SLUGGER. SOLID WOOD. WHAT ABOUT THE POLICE? THE POLICE, SURE. IF WE COULD GET A DELEGATION TO COMPLAIN. BUT IS THAT POSSIBLE ON THIS BLOCK? MR. FINKELSTEIN, I'LL GIVE YOU MY HONEST OPINION. I THINK THERE'S ONLY ONE SENSIBLE THING FOR YOU TO DO. YES? I THINK YOU OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT MOVING. IT'S MY HONEST OPINION. ARE YOU A JEW, MR. NEWMAN? NO, BUT THEY THINK YOU ARE, RIGHT? WELL... SUPPOSING I TOLD YOU TO MOVE? MR. FINKELSTEIN, I CAME TO GIVE YOU MY OPINION. I THOUGHT YOU WERE BUYING FROM THEM ON SUNDAYS BECAUSE THEY MADE YOU BUY. I THOUGHT NO MATTER WHAT YOU DID, YOU WERE STILL MY FRIEND... BECAUSE YOU WERE A MAN OF INTELLIGENCE. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO... FOR GOD'S SAKE, DON'T YOU SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING? THERE'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND A COUPLE OF MILLION IS JEWS. IT'S YOU THEY WANT, NOT ME! THEY ARE A GANG OF DEVILS... AND THEY WANT THIS COUNTRY. AND I MUST TELL YOU, IF-IF YOU HAD ANY REGARD FOR YOUR COUNTRY, YOU WOULDN'T TELL ME TO MOVE. I WILL NOT MOVE, MR. NEWMAN. I WILL NOT DO IT. I WON'T! I SIMPLY WAS TRYING... NO, I WILL NOT! DID YOU TALK TO FRED? I TALKED TO FRED AND I TALKED TO CARLSON AND I TALKED TO FINKELSTEIN, AND I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE HAVING ANY TROUBLE WITH OUR GARBAGE CANS ANYMORE. ALL RIGHT? I WAS JUST ASKING, THAT'S ALL. WHY'D YOU TALK TO FINKELSTEIN? TO WARN HIM TO MOVE. YOU DID? YOU TOLD HIM TO MOVE? AND FRED. WHAT ABOUT FRED? GERT, I TOOK CARE OF THINGS. ALL RIGHT? PLEASE, DON'T WORRY. OKAY. OKAY. HI, ELSIE. HOW'S FRED DOING? OH, HE'S OKAY. GREAT. FIVE. THERE YOU GO. HAVE A GOOD DAY. THANK YOU. AH. OH, EXCUSE ME. I THOUGHT I WAS NEXT. HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON, MRS. HAMILTON. THANK YOU. MRS. DEWITT, LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND WITH THAT. YOU GO AHEAD, MRS. NEWMAN. YOU WERE BEFORE ME. AH. THANK YOU. THIRTY-FIVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HELLO, ELSIE. OH. I'M SORRY. I'LL BREAK YOUR HAND IF YOU PICK THAT UP. YOU REALLY... DON'T, DON'T. IT'S GONNA BE VERY PAINFUL WHEN I DO THAT... AND SAY, "GIN!" DID YOU HEAR THE NEWS, LAWRENCE? THAT WOMAN IS STILL IN A COMA. STILL? YES. - WHO'S THAT? - OH. JUST SOME WOMAN. THE POLICE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT'VE BEEN ATTACKED NEAR HERE. YEAH? BUT SHE'S PUERTO RICAN, NOT JEWISH. SO IT ISN'T, YOU KNOW... WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE? OH, COME ON, GERT. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH US. GERTRUDE, WE'VE GOT TO START ENJOYING OURSELVES AGAIN. I DON'T LIKE THIS PLACE, LULLY. YOU... DO YOU MEAN, MOTHER? OR... NO. OR ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD? I THOUGHT THINGS HAD CHANGED WHEN YOU SPOKE TO FRED AND CARLSON, BUT THEY HAVEN'T. IT SEEMS THEY GOT WORSE. SOMETIMES I THINK WE OUGHTA MOVE FROM HERE MAYBE, TO ANOTHER CITY. NOW, LET'S EXAMINE THINGS, DEAR. LULLY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA MAKE A LIFE FOR ME. I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA GET TO STAY HOME AND FIX A PLACE FOR YOU. I AIN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO COOK SOMETHING NICE. I COOK GOOD. I AIN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO HANG UP CURTAINS. - ALL IT'S BEEN IS TROUBLE AND MORE TROUBLE. - WHAT CAN I DO? - THINK ABOUT IT. WHAT EXACTLY CAN I DO? - GO TO FRED. GO TO FRED! GO TO FRED! I CAN'T. LULLY, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. THEY'RE GONNA TAKE OVER THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AS SURE AS YOU'RE BORN, AND I WANNA KNOW WHAT END OF THE BROOM WE'RE GONNA BE ON. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, DEAR. DO YOU FEEL THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO TELL FINKELSTEIN WHERE TO LIVE? OR FOR THAT MATTER, TO TELL US WHERE TO LIVE? NO, BUT THEY DO. EVERYBODY ON THE COAST WAS TALKING ABOUT IT. THEY'LL HAVE SPECIAL NEIGHBORHOODS FOR ALL OF US, OR EVEN SPECIAL STATES. OH, NONSENSE. THEY CAN'T DO THAT. OF COURSE THEY CAN. LOOK WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN EUROPE! I AM NOT GETTING DOWN ON MY KNEES TO FRED OR THAT GANG OF LUNATICS... FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF LIVING IN MY OWN HOUSE. WELL, WHEN THE WAR'S OVER AND THEY START CRACKING DOWN, WE'LL FIND OURSELVES FORCED OUT OF HERE ALONG WITH FINKELSTEIN, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, I'M TELLING YOU. I'LL GO TO FRED. MAYBE HE'LL LISTEN TO ME. NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT. LISTEN TO ME! I FORBID IT. YOU UNDERSTAND ME? GERT? GERTIE, COME ON. LISTEN. FORGET IT. COME ON. LET'S GO TO THE MOVIES, ALL RIGHT? WE'LL WALK OVER, WE'LL CATCH A MOVIE. I'LL SEE YOU SOON. BOTH OF YOU BEHAVE. DRIVE SAFE. ARE YOU COLD? NOT THAT MUCH. IT'S NICE OUT. GERT, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE A LONG TRIP? TO HOLLYWOOD, SAY? IT'S CHEAP TO LIVE OUT THERE. NO, NO. I MEAN, TO VISIT. IS IT TRUE THAT YOU CAN BUY MAPS THAT TELL YOU WHERE THE STARS LIVE? YEAH. BEVERLY HILLS. EXCUSE ME. THAT SEEM STRANGE? NOT PARTICULARLY. WHY WERE THEY STANDING AROUND THERE? WELL, MAYBE WAITING FOR SOMEONE. YOU RECOGNIZE ANY OF 'EM? NO. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO WITH US? BETTER WE DON'T KNOW. NO, NOT MY CHILD! NO! THEY CAN'T KILL THE CHILDREN JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE JEWISH. WHY NOT? WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR, IKEY? HEY, WE'RE WATCHING THIS! THEY'RE JUST A BUNCH OF JERKS. GERT, YOU'VE GOT TO STOP BEING THIS WAY. I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO FRED ANYMORE. I CAN'T ACT THAT WAY. EVEN IF THEY DECIDED THAT I WAS ALL RIGHT, I COULDN'T GO ALONG WITH THEM. AND NEITHER COULD YOU. YOU'RE TOO FINE A PERSON. YOU ARE! TOO FINE. GERT, I WAS THINKING. WHEN THE WAR'S OVER, MAYBE YOU COULD STOP WORKING... AND WE COULD THINK ABOUT HAVING A CHILD. HEY, SAMMY, WHERE YOU GOIN'? DIDN'T YOU HEAR HIM? WHAT'S YOUR HURRY? HEY! ALL RIGHT, NOW CUT THAT OUT! HEY! NO! NO! - LULLY! - RUN! OH! STOP IT! OH! COME HERE! - MR. NEWMAN! - AAH! AAH! AAH! HOLD IT! ALL RIGHT, YOU HEBE BASTARDS. THIS WAS A WARM-UP. - I AIN'T FINISHED WITH 'EM YET! - YOU'RE FINISHED! LET'S GO! COME ON, BOYS, LET'S GO. SHAKING? SO ARE YOU. HERE. EASY. HOW'S YOUR HEART? NOT WHAT IT WAS. ICE? DO YOU HAVE ICE?

I DIDN'T KNOW. IT'S A TRAGEDY, I MEAN, WHAT'S HAPPENING... WHAT'S HAPPENING THESE DAYS. PEOPLE MURDERING ONE ANOTHER, NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING. ANYWAY, WE... WE SHOWED THOSE BASTARDS SOMETHING, DIDN'T WE? YEAH. WILL YOU BE ALL RIGHT? YEAH. THANK YOU, MR. FINKELSTEIN. LULLY! OH, MY GOD! YOUR FACE! WH-WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN THERE? I-I THOUGHT FRED COULD STOP IT FASTER. I... - YOU WENT TO THE WRONG GUY. - I WANNA TALK TO YOU, LARRY. THAT WOMAN DIED, FRED. DID YOU KNOW? IT'S A HOMICIDE NOW. I KNOW, BECAUSE I SAW PETEY RAPE HER THAT NIGHT. SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA TALK ABOUT, FRED? HUH? WHAT THE HELL ARE WE GONNA TALK ABOUT? OH, MY GOD. OH. LULLY. OH, WAIT. LULLY! LULLY, WAIT!
