I hate Gothenburg! Adam, are you getting ready? - Won't be long! - It's heavy, so— - Yes. - I'll check on Adam, then. Adam, sweetheart. Just wondering how you're getting on. Hey, old man? How is it going? Dammit! Sweet little Trampe. Cutie. - Hi, Molly. - Hello. Trampe doesn't want to jump today. He's missing you already. - Here. - Thanks. - But Gothenburg—It's got everything. - Yes, a hundred thousand criminals and a million crabs and fish. - And Liseberg. - You can go and queue there if you want. - Shall we do a test? - A test? - Yeah, to see if it's going to be you and me forever. - Close your eyes and stay completely still, OK? - Yes. Here. Trampe's moving too. So Tofsan will long for Trampe and I'll long for you. - You mean— - Adam, honey. Just the last bits to sort out, then we're off. Hello, Molly. - Yes, hello. - What's got into you now? - Take him, Dad. - Oh no, we can't take a rabbit, mate. Don't you understand that? - I mean, shit, isn't it beautiful? - Yes. And there. - Is that Koster over there? Or maybe Hisingen? - Over there? I don't know. Is that it? - Let's take a picture, shall we? Listen! - Why? - It looks nice! - Yes, I think it looks nice too. Come on. Our first Gothenburg selfie. Hi! - Tofsan wanted to say goodnight to Trampe. - Yes, okay. Hang on. I'm just— Come on Trampe. - Good night. - Kiss. - Good luck tomorrow at the new school. - Thank you. Don't forget me and Tofsan are always here for you. Kiss Kiss. Sleep well. Good night. Three stops, change to Line 4 and go one stop. - I know, Dad. - Good. Fine. That's right—You have to tap the card inside the tram as well. You have to register the journey. - How? - Watch what everyone else does. What do I do? I don't know how— - I'll show you. There you are. - Thanks very much. Damn. No, dammit, please—Wait—Wait! I'm looking for—my classroom— - So what's it called? - Pluto. No—Saturn. Mercury. - Yeah? Then we're in the same class. Come on! My name's Eva, by the way. Yes, Jonte? – Swimming things. - Swimwear is fine. Ah good. I was wondering where you'd got to. You're Adam, aren't you? - Yes. - Welcome. You can sit next to Alexander. Go on. We're talking about what to take on our class trip. - What are you thinking, Mia? - Snacks. - Good. Any other ideas? - Something to drink on the bus, like? - That's really really good. And— Great, you can think some more about that. - What the hell are you doing? - It has to go in the drawer. But now I thought we should discuss how we include— - It should be here. - Okay. Now let's talk about how we're going to bring in the last funding for the trip. Does anyone have any ideas there? Where are you from? - Skåne. Yes, Skurup. - Is that in Sweden? - Of course it's in Sweden! - Do you skate? - No. - Alexander! What have we said about skateboarding indoors? - It wasn't me. - This time you're going to the headmaster— - No, it was me. So—sorry. - Adam, you know—You really don't have to take the blame for this. - But that's how it was. - Okay. But it's still your skateboard, Alexander? - Yeah sure, it is. - Yeah sure, it really is. He's all right, really. He says a lot of stuff and all you can do is agree. I have ADHD, and he knows that. You can say you've got ADHD too. Have you? - No. - Oh hey, that Molly who messaged you, is that your girl? - Come in. The headmaster's on his way. No, I mean, it was just bad luck. It wasn't on purpose He rolled the skateboard to me, and I rolled it back and that's— how it happened. "It was just bad luck." "I just happened to—" "It was someone else's fault." - You hear what you sound like, don't you? - Yes. - There are convicted criminals in prisons all over the world saying exactly the same. Then they're released and do exactly the same thing, over and over and over again. Until— anarchy and lawlessness take over. Riots in the streets. Vigilantes at war with each other. Famine. Chaos. Sounds like Gothenburg's as hard as it gets. And I want you to come back right now. I miss you so much already. - You need to sleep now, it's very late. - Yes I know. Talk to you tomorrow. - Okay. Bye for now. - I think you should buy Trampe a proper cage. Don't you think so? - Hey. What happened today? - Stop it. I've already told you. - So there was nothing good today? - No. - You can read for ten minutes, then turn off the light. Kiss. Now! Twenty point five seconds. That's nothing. You have to learn to breathe deeply. Okay, try again! Ready, set— Stretch your legs and it'll be— It'll be five-nil! Yes! - Eva, could you come here? - I'm getting ready for school. - You can come and have a look, can't you? I have to choose a tattoo today. Look, I'll have your names on my shoulder. What do you think of that style? - That one maybe? Or that one? We don't have any toppings that've been slaughtered, do we? At the top it'll say Max, then you and lastly—at least at the bottom, Tobbe. - Man! - Woman, you mean. Is Eva ready? - Oh yeah, Eva? No, she's just left for school with Leyla. - Max is playing at washing cars with your Xbox, Tobbe. - What?! Max, you little shit! - Be glad you don't have brothers. - Yes. You know, once when Tobbe was going to drop Max off, he went to the wrong school. - Yes, boys have smaller brains than girls. - But—their heads are the same size. - Okay, well, worse then. Kind of completely useless. - What's wrong? What's wrong? I think Mum and Dad are getting a divorce. - Is it—like—decided? - I don't know, but Dad's away a lot. All the time. When he's at home, they just argue. And he's been looking for a flat to live in. And I haven't even got to see it. I'm not stupid, I do understand. And damn you if you become besties with Leyla! - Oh come on! - Yes. - Me? - Yup. - Hey sweetie. How's it going? - It's your Dad. - No. - Hello Eva. - I'm just a little annoyed. - Okay then. Mum. - Hi. - Why are you at home in the middle of the day? - Dad and I just needed to talk a little. - Will he be home later? - Of course he will. I have to go to work, but there are sandwiches in the fridge. Just help yourself. Hi Eva. - Hi. I'm so damn mad at him. And all boys. They're idiots. - My little brother is kinda cute. - He'll grow up and be just like them. - I don't believe that. - All the boys in our class are so annoying. - They're not him, he isn't them. - He'll turn into them. - No. - Yes. - No! - Yes! Help me! Mum and Dad are divorced, so they compete to give me stuff. I have like two of everything at home. I have one exactly the same at my Dad's. - Are yours divorced too, yeah? - No. - Okay, come on. You have to try it. Know what? No one in the class is dating. Not even Leyla. And I've never been. Not with anyone. - Have you ever done it? - Done what? - Made out with a girl! You and Molly, yeah? You've probably done it with your tongue too. I knew it. - No. - I knew it! - Here. - Thanks. I'm never getting married. - Why should you even? To have someone to argue with? What if Dad's met someone new? He might marry her. Like in a sick movie. You wake up and like: "Hello, I'm your new Mum." - What's it called? Stuff mother? - Stepmother. - Can we make each other a promise? That it'll always just be us? Kind of like a pact. You and me, no boys. An anti-boy pact. - What do you mean? - I mean you don't see anyone ever. - It's hard not to see boys. - Not the way you looked at that new wimp. - I did not. - Seriously. Whoever breaks the pact can never be friends again. It's finished. I, Annika, promise and swear — to never look at a boy, talk to a boy, think about a boy— or get together with anyone as long as I live. Your turn. - But I'm a vegetarian. - Eva, come on now, we have to do this. You promise to never look at a boy, talk to a boy, think about a boy— or get together with anyone as long as you live. You're the very best friend ever. - The same. - Dad's famous chicken stew for us. - Lovely. - Toys off the table. - Be careful. Max, please. - And to Eva, without chicken. - Thanks. - Looks great. - Then let's eat. This is going to be good. - Max, do you know how chickens live? - Yes. First in an egg. - They're locked in cramped little cages— - Eva, please. There you have the same good stew, but without chicken. - Chicken stew without chicken. Great! - Tobbe! - And tomorrow it'll be sausage stroganoff, without sausage, without stroganoff. - Tobbe, that's enough. Do you know how they live before you kill them? Dirty, crowded and diseased. - Not at the dinner table, honey. - No, that's enough now. - What kind of broth did you have in my pot? - It was—something like— - A regular vegetable broth, simple. Now I'd like to hear a little about this new boy in your class. What's he like? - He's okay. - What's his name, then? - Adam. - Oh, Adam. - Tobbe. - Does he seem nice? - Nice Adam. - What's wrong with you? - Good, Tobbe. Well done. - I was only joking. - Yeah, very funny. - Who do you think had most fun? - Can I have some more of that yellow stuff? - Oh, there's some bite to that. - Is there? - A class trip sounds as cool as it gets. - No, I don't know. - Yes, you had fun with your old class. - But I knew them. - Then you can get to know your new classmates, it's perfect. - The yellow was the strong one, right? - It was strong. A real bite to it. – Hasta la vista, baby. – Say it again, please! Hasta la vista, baby. I know one more, wait. May the force be with you. - Yeah, we'd better go now. - Three—Two—One! - Hi, Annika. - Hi. - Have a good day at school. Bye. - Bye. - Hey Eva! Little bit of a problem there. - I gotta go. - Yeah, I know, but— - A flat tyre! - Just as well you saw it. I actually borrowed it yesterday. That's why it's a bit of a problem now. - Poor quality. Sorry. - It's OK. - I—I don't usually take the tram. - No. Group 2? Slip into the music room. Brainstorm ideas for evening activities. Games and all that. And group 3, you can sit down here and come up with suggestions for the menu. And, listen! Now these salami sausages are here you can start selling them. Yes! - I've got a great idea. Everyone has to tell a ghost story. - I know something really scary. To have to sell ground up, murdered animals, stuffed in their own guts, and call it salami - But it's a regular sausage. - I think we should stay at home. Donate the money to something good instead. Like the Animal Rights Association and Save the Children. - What shall we do in the evenings, then? - Russian Postman. - Stop it. - Cowards. - What's that? - But then— - Truth or Dare, then? We can at least try it, can't we? Come on. - Disrespect. - Everything all right in here? - Yes, but that lot don't want to do anything. - Yes, well— – Favourite food? - Tacos. - The most disgusting thing you've ever eaten? - Snails. - Okay, the sickest thing anyone's done? - Jumped from the ten metre board. - Who are you in love with? Who are you in love with? - I'm not in love with anyone. - You didn't say, so you get to kiss whoever the bottle ends up on. - Kiss? Now I spin. - Shall we do what you wanted to do, then? - Yes. I have the notes in my back pack. - Is it okay if we look at the animals? - Here you go. Let me know if you need help. We've brought an iguana into the large terrarium. - Yes, great fun. Do you need any help? - We're fine, thank you. - Next week I'll be bringing in three Vietnamese mini pigs as well. I'M IN PRISON Thanks for letting us look! Little bastards. Fucking kids! What the hell are they thinking? Fucking shit. Hello? - Look at what they've done! Let me tell you. All the animals in here are born and raised in captivity. And if I let them out, they'd die a slow and painful death. Is that being an animal lover, then? - No— - No! Can I help you with something? - I want to buy a rabbit cage. - Come with me, I'll show you. What is it? - Dad— This one should be without ham. And it isn't. It's with ham, of course. Here. Would you cut it up? Okay, are you ready? One, two, three. - It turned out great! - Didn't it? - Very nice, Mum. - But when I see it, so— I think there's a name missing. - Stop. The children are always one's children, no matter what happens. - Well okay—No, I don't know. In fact, I wouldn't have hesitated to tattoo your name. - Why haven't you done it, then? - Well, I mean theoretically. - What? Okay, so—A theoretical tattoo? - Oh just stop! Mum! Actually, I don't understand why Dad isn't allowed to join in. No— - Okay? Fine, you know what? We'll eat now. Okay? Good. Thank you. But Markus, just one thing— Tell me where you get those theoretical tattoos. I'd love to make one. I'd love to have your name here. Theoretically. - Eva, please. - Eva, I was joking— Yes, capricciosa, calzone and Eva menstrazione. - Tobbe! Please stop. - That's completely out of order. What Mum and Dad are doing, Annika's have been doing for a long time. And now they're going to divorce. - Just think. Mum and Dad, out on a date? Dad says: "Hey, do you come here often?" Or Mum—"Hello, my name's Maja. Shall we seize the day, kind of thing?" You shouldn't worry. They will never divorce, I promise. It's no fun without you. Listen, the pizzas are getting cold. And cold vegetable pizza must be even more disgusting than hot, right? The lesson is over. Now we collect the tools. - Alexander— - I just have one thing to say. My name is Alexander and I throw up if I eat coriander! No, it's my birthday soon, and I'm having a party next Saturday. And everyone's invited, except you, Tobias. So it's my birthday. Party at my house next Saturday. Everyone is invited. - We heard. - Now let's tidy up. Come on. We can't go to that party, you do understand that, don't you? The Pact. What are you thinking? - I sort of think, if we're not involved, it won't be a statement. - Hold on, what do you mean? Not going is a statement. - Yes, but wouldn't it be better if we were there— and then treat all the boys like air, so it gets noticed? Because otherwise no one will think we're not there. - Smart. - I mean, who hears you when you scream in the forest? Come on. Maybe the rabbit wants some? - No, Alex! Rabbits can't eat chocolate. - Lucky they're not here right now. - Who? - Eva and Annika. They're kind of the worst militant animal lovers. Eva would've burned your house down if she knew you had pets in cages. But its all right. Just keep it a secret. Keep the rabbit in the cage, but keep it in your room or in the closet. And then you just never bring it up with them. - But a lot of people have pets. - I know. They hate boys too. There's a lot of boys. They probably hate things like meat, cars, a lot of common stuff like that. They have a blog. I'll show you. Look. - Terrorism at the pet store. Pretty extreme. - Yep. - The anti-boy pact, that's scary. Four cheers for Alex! Hip, hip— - Put it out before we burn the whole house down. - You never liked this house. - Aren't his parents divorced? - Yes, I think so. Okay, now we're going to do something. Not Truth or Dare. - What are we going to do then? - You'll see later, it'll be a lot of fun. The Russian Postman's here. Spasiba! Will you choose to hold hands, hug, pet or kiss? - Hug. Who will it be, then? Will it be her? Will it be him? Or will it be her? - Yes, her. - Her. Come on, Leyla. - I have to go to the bathroom. - Okay. - And what do you choose? – Hold hands. Spasiba! Hold hands with Leyla. Whose turn it it? Will it be her or him? - Him. - You. - Come on. - Come on. I won't say anything to Molly. You're welcome. - Hello. - Hello. The Postman's here. - What do you choose? Kiss, maybe? - Kiss, no. - Perfect! - No, Alex—! - Well. Who gets it, then? Will it be her, or will it be her? Yes, yes! - Or maybe her? - OK. - Go on, then! - Good. Man, come on now! You must be done by now? Hello, you must be finished? Hello? What's taking so long? - Yes, I wonder— What did you and Adam do? - Nothing. - But you were in there for so long. - We really did nothing. - Okay. Yes, but we're leaving now. Bye. - Bye. - I can go with you. - Okay. Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. You need to get some practice. - Well, I think that's enough. You can practise more later. - Yes. Here. - Thanks. Don't you want to join in? - No—I mean—I'm not very good. - You don't have to be good at everything. - No, but football, I'd probably like to get a little more practice in first. - Eva, come on. What did you actually do? What d'you mean? - You and Adam, at Alexander's. You took so long, everyone says. - Stop it now. I have to go home and change. I've got practice. Hello, has anyone seen my football boots? - No, honey. Try in the hall. - Here! - Max, thank you! Where did you find them? - In my room. Although I didn't put them there. - Okay. But I do know about one thing. - What's that? - I'm in love with my classmate Samira. - How do you know? - Because when I think of her, I feel it here. Or here. Or even here. - Not in your feet, surely? - Yes, seriously. - Here. Some fruit. - Thanks Mum. - Aren't you going to wear football strip? - Yes, but I'll change there instead. - We'll give you a lift. - No need. - I have to fix the dishwasher. - What about it? - There's something wrong with it. - What? - It's not draining. - I'll fix it. - Well, it— - Hi. - Hi. - Oh thank you. - Hi. - Hi. Should we—? - Yes, yes. Put a bit more effort into it. All your strength. That wasn't a corner, and I caught it. - What d'you mean no corner? - It was close. If I hadn't been standing here, it would have been a goal. - How do you aim a ball? - Get in the right position, and it'll end up here. - One, two, three. - Yes, you can do it! - Yes. - I once shot it up there. - Yes. But how long have you been playing football? - I've been playing since I was 6. Me and Annika started at the same time. I practise Tuesday and Thursday and there are matches at the weekends. - If I was going to get really good at football— I'd need Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays too. Then you mustn't forget Christmas Eve and another hundred years. There. There it is. Yes it was. Was it good? Yeah, it was really cool. - Won't the trip be a lot of fun? - Yes, great fun. With the paddling and hiking and all the rest. - If the weather's nice. - Yes, that goes without saying. - What's that? - It's you. - What? - See? It's a great picture. - Me? I absolutely don't see it. OK. - Here's the hair, then that's the face. And there's the ears. This stick can be eyebrows. - Okay, a little, just a little similar. - Yes. - It's cold. - Do you want to borrow? Thanks. See you tomorrow. Bye. - Bye. - Hi. - Hi. Excuse me. Did you know that Gothenburg's tramway system is the largest in the whole Norden area? 161 kilometers. - How do you know that? - No—but it's like—Good to know. Anyway, I was trhinking about this sausage thing. And I kind of thought, if you want—I could sort of—sell them. I'll ring the doorbells and sell your sausages as well as mine. - What? - Yeah, so that you don't have to sell meat. And then you just kind of tag along. Shit, I forgot your top. - It doesn't matter. - Sure? - Yes. - OK. Where were you yesterday? You never miss practice. - I didn't feel too well. Sore throat and stuff. - Mum's promised to buy my sausage. - That's nice of her. - She realised I didn't want to, so she's buying them all and giving them away at work. Since she doesn't know how many there are, I can include yours. Good, isn't it? - Yes, but it's not necessary. - What d'you mean? You'll sell them yourself? - No, but I'll solve it. - But I have solved it. - Me too! - Eva, Annika. Okay. Sorry I asked. - No marketing. - This isn't marketing. - We have salami! - Thanks. - No no. Hi! We're from class 6B and— - Maybe if we smile more? - Yes. - Yeah, hi. - Hi! - I'm making a video. Are you going to join in? - We've come to the wrong place. - Yes? Wait, now. - We're selling salami. - Thanks but no thanks. - Salami is good. - I want some! - You don't know what salami is. Go and get a piece of sugar instead. Now it's getting silly. Now they're eating sugar instead. Are you satisfied now? OK, look, this got out of hand. Can we do it like this? No salami, but thanks—I should— - Thanks. Hi. We're from class 6B. We're selling salami to raise money for our class trip. - But it'll only work if we can raise enough money. - Yes, of course you can sell your sausage. Come in, come in. Sit down for a bit. - Thanks very much. - Are you really a boy with such long hair? Let's see. Here's— Yes, that'll probably be enough. Well then. Let's make a start. Then we'll get down to business. And the nail polish is there. Now you paint on the skin. She was completely crazy! - Getting me to paint her toenails! - How many sausages do you have left? - Something like four, I think Mum and Dad can buy them. - Sure? - Easy. - Okay. here. - Thanks. Well—I mean—I'm having my birthday soon and we're having cake and stuff like that on Saturday at two o'clock. - Sounds like fun. Congratulations in advance. - Thanks. - It's not a party or anything— - OK. - But if you'd like to, it'd be great fun if you came. - Yes I'd love to come. - Cool! Saturday at two. - See you there. - Bye. - Bye. I'm off now. Hi Tobbe. - Stop, stop. My brain's getting an error message. Error. My sister's happy even though twelve million pigs will be slaughtered today. - Maybe because I'm getting away from you? Hi. I thought I'd take the tram with you. - Aren't you going by bike? - No, I was going to take the tram with you. You don't want me to, do you? - What? No, stop it. Of course I want you to. - Isn't it boring to go alone all the time? - Well yeah, pretty boring. - Dad wrote me this: Hey, sweetie. Can't we go to Liseberg one day? - Does he think I'm six? Seven? - But you love Liseberg. Yes, true. Hi. - Come on. We need to plan another action against the animal cruelty shop. Do you remember what she said? That they'd be selling mini-pigs. Such smart animals, in captivity. - Are there wild mini-pigs? - I can do it on Sunday, I don't have a match. - I can't then, I'm going to see Grandma. But I've nothing on Saturday. Can you do Saturday? - Ye-eah— - Then let's say Saturday. The tram should be along soon, shouldn't it? Look, new kid. Let's see, how did it go? Was it good? - Shit, you did really well! - Thanks. - Eva can't come to your party. - But—! - So have you actually invited Eva? - So what? - What really happened at the Russian Postman game? - Well, nothing. - Just that nothing took a long time. I'm just going to do it once more, so it feels right. Listen. I feel we have to make something good out of Adam's birthday. And I think I have the best of all ideas. - What is it? What! - Here's what I'm thinking. I talked to— - Lit-tle-pigs! - But Max! You haven't seen this. - Yes, I certainly have. I can't feel anything in my foot any more. There may be nothing left. So, maybe I'm not in love with Samira any more. I don't know, Max. - But what do you need this for? - Nothing. OK. I'll light the candles. - You can hold off on that, actually. I can do them. I have the best present in the world for you. Weird that we have birthdays in the same month. We're like brothers. - OK to use these glasses, yeah? - No— - Are those walkie-talkies? - Yes. - Shit, that's so cool. - Thank you, Alexander. - That is too much. - This is the best. - No, is it a skateboard? - Yes. Private lessons are included, so you become a big city guy. How's this going to work? At school, I can hardly keep my balance, I mean. - I think you should answer it, Adam. - Yes, okay. - Surprise! Congratulations! It was so funny, because I called your Mum to see if you could come to Gothenburg sometime, and so— - So much fun. - Yes. Actually, we were supposed to come next weekend, but we did this one because it's your birthday. - So sweet. - Definitely. - Aren't you going to blow them out? - Yeah. One more. So. - Now you get to open my present. - OK. - No, look, isn't that nice! - I made it in woodwork class. - It's so lovely. Isn't it, Adam? - It's great. - So are you Trampe, or what? - Yep. - Have you invited anyone else? - Maybe someone selling salami. - Yes, we don't wanrt any more sausage anyway. - No, Dad, I'll get it. - Did you do all the embroidery and everything? Happy Birthday! - I thought you weren't coming. - This is something you need. - Thanks. Hey! This is fun. Come in! Tarek, Adam's father. - Emma. - Eva's in our class. - Have a seat. - Thanks. - Hi. Molly. - Hi. Eva. - Here you are, you get some cake too. - Anyway, Molly was in my class before. Now she's in Gothenburg with her parents, so that's why she's here. - Adam got this from Molly. I think it's a pillow. You could sort of hang it on the wall. Or you could use it as an ornament. - Maybe you could tell Eva, Adam, who Tofsan and Trampe are instead. - Yes. - No, just hold on. - Mum, no. - Actually, I was really just passing, so— Annika's waiting for me— - Yes absolutely. No sweat. - Aren't you going to have some juice? - No, thanks. - This is Adam's rabbit Trampe. And Molly's rabbit is called Tofsan. - So I got Trampe from Molly when I was about to move. I didn't want him. - No— - Adam— - Fine. - Eva, wait. Please! Eva, please. - So she's your girl? Are you together? - No, I mean— - I believe this is mine. - Eva... Well—so—how long will your parents be in town? - I should probably leave, too. - Are you going? - And you won't want this one either! - Yes Molly— - Let go! - Molly, please, I want the cushion. Molly, please— - Drop it! Thanks for the cake. Very nice. - Molly— - OK. - This is kind of like Downton Abbey. You have a new message. Where are you? It's a quarter past. Why aren't you answering? It was your idea. What are you doing? Hi, I'm here now. Where are you? - I was actually waiting for you, but you didn't come. - Well—I—Sorry, I was just thinking— - - Alex tagged you in a picture. -... do something— - At Adam's. Happy birthday, Adam! Oh right, Eva. The new boy in the class, yeah? Who's having a party, and getting a football. - No. - Yes. - He won't be getting it. Give it here! - But— - Give it here! I mean it! Here, Max. It's yours. - Oh thank you! Now you'll see. One-nil! Two-nil! Come on. And it's three-nil! - Did you find any holes, then? - Yes. There, there, there and.there and there and there. - Six of them? - Eva, I have an appointment with the physiotherapist today and Markus is leaving— - No, I won't take Max today. He's your child! Dammit! - It's okay, Mum, I'll take him. - Are you sure, Tobbe? Thanks! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! - Adam, come on now. Time to wake up,little man. Hear me? - I'm not feeling well, I'm staying at home. - Aren't you? Let's see. Yeah—I don't think you have a fever at least. Is this because of what happened on your birthday? And why you don't want to go on the class trip and all that? But look, the class trip will be great. Aren't you going to go anyway? Okay. Well, we'll make sure you stay at home today. - Is he hungry? Has he been fed? - Yes he has. Just go! - All right. You can go a little faster, come on. Good. It's supposed to be tough. And then sprint in the last lap. Good. Gather round! Blue ribbon. - Thanks. Hey! - Listen, I was watching your Mum and Dad. - Yes, so what? - Aren't they mad at each other? They're divorced. - Well, in the beginning they were, but it passed quite quickly, actually. They're like better friends than when they were married. Sick, huh? - I'm so mad at my parents. Especially Dad. - How long will you be there, then? Is he ignoring you? - No, he's met someone new. - Yeah, Mum's new guy is quite nice, actually. He gives me stuff too. Dad says he doesn't have time for dating, but he's just so fucking lazy. Do you want a go? Need any help? - No it's fine. - Dinner. Masterchef Tobbe's offering stew! - And it's vegan? - Yes. At least—I happened to put a few animals in, but you can pick them out. All right? Eva? is that kid still being a bit of a pain? Adam? Because I think— - Annika hates me too. And this weekend we're going on a class trip, and we're not getting along. Everything is shit! - OK, but actually, I have a tip. - If you just— - You have no idea. —say sorry. Train arriving at Gothenburg What do you want? - I'm not going on the class trip. - What? - Not unless we're friends again. I mean— I'm sorry. Come on now. Come on. - No, he's not answering. - But his note said he was going to Skåne. - He must have gone back to Skurup. - Let's drive there. It's my fault, it was my idea to invite Molly. - You couldn't know he'd messed it up like that. - No. - I thought all that stuff came in their teens. - Well, he's almost in his teens. No. Emma, ​​speed up a little. You know, this pact thing is a bit childish, even though a lot of boys are idiots. - Yes. Like Adam. He's a fucking idiot. - Why did you kiss him, then? - What? How did you know that? - It was obvious. - Should not you—? - You think? - Hi Dad. – Hi, honey. What are you doing? - I'm sitting in the pool here with Eva. - Well that's nice. You know—Well, I was just thinking maybe we should meet? Yes, okay. And maybe go to Liseberg or something. What do you think about that? - What are you doing here? - I think Trampe's longing to go home. He's probably not a big city rabbit. - Poor little Trampe. - So—I just wanted to say—I'm sorry. I was a shit, but I want us to be friends again like before. - If you want. But anyway, I want us to go and see films and stuff. Yes. Sometimes. - Okay, sometimes. But no horror movies, okay? - No, okay. - Good. - See you. - We'll do that. Bye. by the way, Adam? How do you know if you're in love? - Yeah— You just know. - Okay. Adam! Mum, drive a little faster! Overtake that car. - Are we in a big hurry? - Yes! - So are you going on the class trip now? - I have to get hold of Eva, she's not answering. Can't you go any faster! - I'm goind as fast as I can. - We'll make it if we make it. You can't go looking like that! - What? What d'you mean? - Yes, what are you wearing? I've only just bought these. They're practical. We're going out into the countryside. Did you have to come along as a class parent? - But—Eva? What? - Can't you overtake? - What does it say on the GPS? - Right. No, hell, left! - Now. Well— - No, Mum, left I said! - We can't turn left here. We have to go round. - Yes, good, Mum. We're so close now. Come on! - What's all this now? - We'll drive around it, there's no danger. - We have to reverse. - I'll take a shortcut. - Well, what do you want? - Is Eva in? - Ah yes, you're Adam? - Yes. - And you've made a fool of yourself, haven't you? - Yes. - I knew that too. But she's already left. - Fuck. - Come on. - Its all over. - I have a friend called Fetch. Do you know what he usually says? - No. - It's never over, he says. He's usually wrong, but— But not now. - I'm fucking lost now. - Are you kidding? We're— No, I'm completely lost. OK. OK now. I got a feeling. They were supposed to go past the petrol station. - There! - There it is. - Look, it's Adam. - Yeah so it is. - It's your brother with Adam. Yes. - There you go. - Tobbe? Has something happened? - No, damn it. Tell Eva to come out. - What? Well, it'll have to be quick. - Yes, it will be. You'll be OK. See you. What do you want? - Can I talk to you? - Why? - Please. - OK, what? - I haven't been completely honest with you— - No, I know. You're with Molly. - What? No! At least—Molly thought so, but— It doesn't matter, because we're not together, and we never have been. - OK— So what have you been lying about? - I— I'm in love with you. Yes, really in love. – Eva! - I think you have to go now. - No. No. Because—First, I probably have to say I didn't tell the truth either. And so I've been an idiot. Because I'm in love with you. - Do you want to be with an idiot? - Yes I do. Do you? - Yes, please. Here we go! So, I'm just going to kind of drink a— Yes! Look at this. It's always the boys who get to talk. In Swedish class, it was 72 percent. in maths 75 percent. in English— - You know what, girls? I think this is good. - That's great. Because— - But I also think this: The best thing we can do is— Work together! English subtitles by faxeholm1234 and jeremys TNT 2023
