[ Woman ] Okay, Willow. If the trees are pleasing purple, what color would the fields be? The fields are bloomin' blue and the sky is yellin' yellow. And what about rip two-shot red? That's my favorite. The rivers are rip two-shot red. The flowers are orange-ray sun? The mountains are jellybean black. And the people? Grassy green. I think you're talking about wheezle Mayfield. - Green people aren't farmers. They're different than US. - Yeah? They rich, then? - Jake. - Hmm? I'm gonna go find Marcy and Charles. What do you think? Two, maybe three weeks. It don't rain by then, the seeds are not gonna grow. [ Groans ] I'm afraid you're right, wheezle. It is worse than we thought. [ Woman ] Last pot, okay? Who wants coffee? None for me, Maggie. Give it to the mayor. Thanks. Miss Maggie, that'll be an I.O.U. On the p-i-e. Why don't I just put it on your t-a-b? [ Man ] What is deputy boy up to now? [ Siren wailing ] I sure do miss his dad. I got a 10-95 and a 6-5-4. What's goin' on? Shh. The sheriff caught a crook. - License and registration, please, sir. - Bet he forgot his ticket book. I'll be right back. Told ya. Willow, where're you going? I'm gonna get a better look. Well, Mr. Uh-- I'm Harvey. Harvey h. Potter. Mr. Harvey h. Potter. You can't be drivin' around these parts with no license in an unregistered vehicle. I'm gonna have to give you a few of these citations and impound your vehicle. - You like pecan pie? - Uh, what's that? I make the best pecan pie that ever warmed your gizzards. I pick the pecans myself. Sometimes it takes... only one. That's right. But I still gotta make that pie. I can't give up. No, I gotta have Patience. I gotta cook that pecan just right. And if I do, that pecan's got so much flavor, it just spreads. And pretty soon you got yourself a whole pecan pie. Oh, I can... [ Smacks lips ] Taste it. - What's he doin', Willow? - Shh. Aw, there's nothing better. There's nothing better than that pecan pie. Mr., uh, Harvey h. Potter. Thank you. [ Sniffing ] What's that smell? That's my pie. And it's for you. Here you go. Ahh! Ooh! Careful, it's hot. [ Sniffing ] Mr. Potter, being that you're new here in town, I'm not gonna impound your vehicle. You have a nice pie. [ Chuckles ] Day. Day. Bye, bye. Thanks. [ Engine revving, tires screeching ] Ahh! Tickets! Boy, if I knew a pie could get me out of trouble like that, I'd be bakin' every day. A truck full of pies seems pretty weird. Shh. That farmer had a pie tin on his seat. He put one pecan in it, and the whole pecan pie is there-- a whole, steaming, hot pecan pie! Nobody makes a pie out of thin air. Unless... He's not one of US. I saw this show on TV last night... Where they said they found a real alien... After its ship crashed back in 1950. It was some old film someone had been hiding for years. They had these experts from Hollywood watch the film. They even said the alien was real. [ Wheezle ] Hey, you! Might as well go back in the direction you came. - Nothin's gonna grow here. Had no rain in over a year. - Good morning. Ya deaf? I said pack up. You're wasting your time here. My name's Harvey Potter. I don't care what they call ya, and I don't wanna know ya, either. -Just load up and start driving. -What do you mean, driving? Ever since the drought started, wheezle's been gettin' on everyone. Why don't you get on him? Go on. I dare you. Yeah, Willow, do it! Go. Come on. And another thing-- - [ laughing ] Nice shot. - Hey, you kids! I seen ya! - Wasting water again. I'll be calling your parents. - [ Laughing ] And you! I don't know what you're doing here, but it better not involve water. Got my bad eye on you, Potter. Hah. Hmm. Hey, mama! What's that? A centennial banner. Our farm's gonna be a hundred years old in September. We're gonna have a big party. That's great. But you know the new farmer that just moved in? He made a whole pecan pie out of just one little pecan! Really? Maybe he'll swap recipes. I'm serious, mama. So am I! Yes, I know, Mr. Mayfield. I'm very sorry. I'm sure it won't happen again. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. Bye. Why are you throwing water balloons at wheezle Mayfield? I don't need to be getting those kinds of phone calls. I'm sorry, daddy. But he was being a jerk to the new farmer. That doesn't excuse what you did. Listen, you know our situation. So next time, put something besides water in those balloons. And if you're gonna throw 'em at wheezle Mayfield, make sure you hit him, okay? Help you with something? Yeah. That oughta do the trick. Good. [ Rings ] So, digging up a few weeds today? No, but I got a lot of plowing to do. Plowin'? You may want a bigger tool. Oh, there goes the new farmer. He must have a brain the size of a corn kernel to have moved in. More like the size of a sesame seed. He was just in my store and bought a hand hoe. Said he was gonna plow his field with it. That sure ain't a sane man talking. Maybe he's got some new way of irrigating without water. Irrigate without water? That'd be what, "air-igation"? [ Laughing ] Another slice, please. All right. Now, crystal, I thought you was on a diet. Hmm. I am. [ Clears throat ] All right. Last pot of coffee. Who wants a cup? That's me. I tell you, Maggie. Limiting bathing is one thing, but limiting coffee! Danged arthritis. You'd think it was gonna rain by how much it's actin' up. Wheezle and I were at the reservoir yesterday. We don't have more than two or three months of drinking water left. [ Mayor ] You heard what he said, everybody. We've got to tighten our belts even more. No extra water use... Whatsoever. Uh, yeah. Right. Sure. [ Sighs ] Ahh! This arthritis hurts. Telling me I can't make iced tea. Hmph! Like this little bit of water's gonna make a difference. Whoa! Woo, woo, woo! Oh, that's better. Ahh. What's he doing? Shh. Plantin' them pods. Potter! If you're diggin' for water, you might as well go on through to China. I'm not digging, I'm plowing. With a hoe? A whole field? You ain't been here but a day, you're already startin' to get me bothered. I've got a notion to put up a fence. Keep you off my back. A fence? Right. Forget it! I have no idea how we're gonna pay these. Plus the mortgage is due. Can we get it extended? Again? [ Sighs ] You know what I could do? I could talk to the bank... And see if they could work out some kind of deal. Deal? You're not talkin' about selling, are you? We've been through droughts before. Casey, if we get foreclosed on, we have nothing. If I can get them to buy the land for half of what it's worth, we can start over again. What kind of example are we gonna set if we just throw in the towel? We've got to stick together. We have to get everybody's spirits up. That's great, but i'm trying to be realistic. This farm has been in my family for 99 years, 8 months and 12 days. I know. Okay. I'm not gonna give it up. So, we-- so-- work it out. All right. This can wait. Right. This cannot. Maybe ten percent to them. [ Charles ] Look at this fence. He's building a fortress. He's hiding something. I like the way he made the top look. I don't like this one bit! Here she goes again. He's being all secretive 'cause of those pods he planted. Pretty soon, they'll hatch and start eatin' our brains up, scooping them out like they were mashed potatoes. Before you know it, the whole town's gonna be walking around like zombies. [ Hammering ] What in the corn nibblets you think... You're doing? [ Hammering ] It's a fence. I know it's a fence. Why're you putting it up? 'Cause you asked me to. - [ Wheezle ] Who says I told you? - Uh-oh. [ Willow ] Looks like he's gonna grow something. How'd he plow the field so fast? I said I wanted a fence. Look over there. Is there a fence around there? No. You know why? 'Cause I like my views. I'm entitled to my view of your field. Absolutely right. No fence because I'm entitled to a view of your field. Hey, now. Why do you want a view of my fields? All I need is some nosey farmer staring at my field all day. You start hammering that fence in right now... Or I'm gonna get steamed. And you don't wanna see wheezle Mayfield get steamed. Potter? Potter? Potter! Oh, shoot! [ Rings ] Good morning, Earl. Hello again. How you doing? Can I help you with something? Maybe so. I wanna take a look at your corn seed. Well, there it is. Are you sure you don't need no help? No, sir. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'll take this one. You wanna buy just one seed? Nope. [ Whispering ] What's goin' on? [ Indistinct chattering ] That one? No. [ Crowd sighs ] [ Charles groaning ] Hold still! I can't. [ Willow ] Shh. He's getting ready to start plantin'. - [ Groaning ] - [ Yelling ] Hey, where's she going? [ Marcy ] Willow, what's he doing? Is he planting 'em? He's finished. Is he an alien? Yep. [ Radio announcer ] The drought that's been plaguing the waterston tri-county area... For the last year, looks like it's here for the long haul. No rain in sight. On a brighter note, it's my birthday! Would somebody please mind explainin' to me... What all of this "seed" business was yesterday? He's a lunatic is what it's all about. Fool thinks he's gonna grow something. Not without water, he's not. Somebody better tell him the deal here. All we need is for some new farmer to prance in here, start watering his field and drain the reservoir. - Howdy. - Dang! Maggie! These are my favorite trousers. Hi. Hi. I'd like a coffee, black. With no sugar. To go. [ Crystal ] T-to go? Oh, um-- w-we don't have no, uh, "to go" cups. But, um, if you promise to bring it back, - I'll give it to you in a regular cup. - I promise. [ Chuckles ] All right, then. So, uh-- I'm Harvey. - Harvey. I'm Tom Williams. - Hi, Tom. - What are your plans here in waterston? - Gonna farm. [ Snickers ] That's gonna be pretty hard. I mean, we're going through a darned tough drought. I know all about that. We've got some mighty tight water restrictions here too, Mr. Uh... Harvey. I won't be doing any watering. Okay. One coffee to go. Oops. How much do I owe you? This is on the house. Welcome to waterston. Thank you very much. You're so welcome. [ Whispering ] Maggie. Harvey. [ Chuckles ] Bye, now. [ Indistinct mumbling ] Shh. I like him. Child, coffee... To go! Two coffees. Two coffees and a doughnut. Honey, two coffees, two doughnuts and a hard-boiled egg to go. - To go! - To go! [ Rubber duck squeaks ] We'd have seen pods yesterday if Mr. Weakling here hadn't dropped US. Maybe I tried to drop you. Hey, you two. [ Willow ] I'm still trying to figure out how he planted those seeds so fast. Who says he even planted them? All you saw was an empty seed bag. He could've dumped them on the ground. Hey, you kids! Off of my field! [ All yelling ] [ Gasps ] [ Chuckles ] [ Knocking ] Hello, neighbor! All right, partner. I know she's here. Huh? Don't play dumb with me! Oh, the little girl. Stop fooling around and get her. She's already skedaddled. She ran right through here and up over the other side of my fence. She's long gone by now. But you're welcome. You can come in and keep me company. Wanna do that? Not in this lifetime, Potter. Willow Johnson! Where are you? [ Gasps ] Oh, wow! Bloomin' blue. Rip two-shot red. Grassy green. Bloomin'-- Hi. My name's Willow. Hi. I'm Harvey. Is that a real plant? Yeah, but this one needs a little extra care. - A balloon that grew on a stalk? - Mm-hmm. A cornstalk? A balloon stalk. A balloon stalk. I'm gonna replant it. You wanna help? Okay, sure. I have to say, by far, this is the strangest thing I've ever seen. This puts wheezle Mayfield's 200 pound watermelon to shame. Ah, that's a big watermelon. Yeah, but that was a long time ago. Wheezle and his wife grew it. But she's dead, and nothing ever grows around here anymore. Till now, of course. I gotta ask you something kinda odd. Sure, go ahead. Are you an alien? No. [ Chuckles ] Marcy said you probably came down here to start breedin'. After a while, the whole town's gonna be walking around like zombies... After you scoop our brains out and eat them like mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes? No! Mashed potatoes are for gravy. You magic then? I'm just a farmer. Well, if you're not an alien and you ain't magic, how'd you grow 'em? Sometimes you just have to use what you have. You didn't water them, but you used regular corn seeds? Everything starts as a seed. That tree. Grass, flowers, cows. Me, you. We all start out as a seed. Huh. Hadn't thought of myself as a seed before. Unless you count the time when I was six, and I got stuck up to my neck in mud by the reservoir. - I sure felt like a seed then. - I bet you've grown since then. You know, I have. Bye, Harvey. Bye, Willow. Hey, wait. What you gonna do with all them balloons? [ Chuckles ] Oh, great! Seven, eight, nine, ten. I saw 'em. I saw all the colors of the rainbow! Colors? You hit your head or somethin'? Earl, you be nice. Go on, honey, tell US what you saw. They're at the new farmer's place. He grew a whole field of them. I don't know how he did it, being that he didn't use no water. But they grew on a regular stalk just like corn. Only it wasn't corn. I'd know corn if I saw corn, and it was definitely not corn. So, Willow, you sayin' that this new farmer, overnight, grew a crop... With no water. Yes. And what exactly did he grow? Well, balloons. [ All laughing ] That's a good one, Willow. [ Tom laughing ] That's the "air-igation" I was talking about. - Balloons? - Right there on stalks. Big round ones everywhere. I hope they've got my favorite color. Yeah. I saw a ton of rip two-shot red ones. Why don't you have your friend bring his magic wand here? Because if he can grow balloons, I'm sure he'll have no trouble with our plain ol' corn crop. - Jake. - It's no joke, daddy. But you don't have to believe me. You can see for yourself tomorrow at his sale. Oh, please! A balloon sale? I know you don't believe me, but that's okay. 'Cause you're all just gonna miss out! - Uh, I'll take this later. - Hey, crystal. What's your hurry? Uh, I just gotta do my hair. - Put that on my tab. - But you didn't even drink any. - Gotta go. - Hey! Wait up! This requires the attention of a police escort. [ Sheriff ] Thank you. [ Earl ] Sue! Wait up! [ Sheriff mumbling ] Wait for me! [ Knocking ] Hi, Harvey. Hello, Willow. Can we come in? Sure. Hey, everyone, come on! We got a good crop! Come on in. [ Gasping, excited chattering ] It's like the county fair in there. Let's just keep an open mind. Okay? Oh, yeah. [ Girl ] Look, mom! See? I told you there were balloons, daddy. You told me all right. Come on, mommy. You need to touch 'em. Hi, sue. Well, this is better than the annual pumpkin throw. Yeah, yeah. I'd about say it is. He could've spent all night tying these balloons to stalks. Balloons don't grow. Maybe these aren't balloons at all. Maybe they're pods. And this here? This is their larvae stage. [ Gasps ] Orange-ray sun. My favorite color! What do you make of this? [ Tom ] Feels like rubber. And the stalk-- leaves look like corn, but it turns into what seems to be... A string. Come on, tell US already! What can I say? They're, uh-- they're the real deal. They're... balloons. They're balloons. [ Laughing ] It's an amazing thing here. Thank you, Maggie. Mr. Potter, excuse me. If I had known this is what you were doing here, sir, I never would've stopped ya. But now that I have you here, I was wondering if I could trouble you... For another one of those... pies. Y-You see, my, uh... W-Wife-- my wife, she really liked that pie. If I could bring one home, boy, I'd score some major points. I mean, I liked-- she... liked it. Of course. The wife. The wife. [ Tom ] Hey, Mr. Potter. Hey, Tom. Just call me Harvey. Thank you, Harvey. This, uh-- this is pretty amazing. We were wondering just how-- he's trying to ask you how the heck you did it. Hey, Harvey. Hello, Willow. - How much for this one? - Let's see here. Okay, folks. All balloons are $10. [ Woman ] Ten? What? Ten? Ten dollars? For a balloon? Dad, can I have this balloon? I don't know, sweetheart. That's a pretty pricey balloon. - But, dad, it's a balloon that grew on a stalk. - Even if it grows on a stalk. [ Casey ] I'll take one. I know money is tight, and we're all not doing so good right now. But take a look around. We are standing next to a field of balloons! Balloons that grew out of this dry-as-death soil. Maybe I'm crazy, but this field is by far the most amazing thing... That I have ever seen before in my life. I don't know why it's here or how it's here, but it's here. And for $10 and the chance for some of this magic or whatever it is might rub off on US, I think it's a pretty good deal. Bless your heart. Thank you. I'll take one. Thank you, Maggie. All right, who's next? - I'll take this nice red one. - Okay. Thanks, crystal. We'll take this blue one. I hope that covers inflation. Thank you. Who's next? I'll take three. Hey, the mayor's taking three! And it's my money. It's not out of the town budget. Get your favorite-- hello, Earl. You got me, Mr. Potter. Okay, get your favorite color. Mr. Potter, I'll have six. Get your favorite color. They're goin' fast. I'll make a half a dozen for 50 bucks. But I only have six. Well, that's different. All right. Thank you very much. All right. You got it here. Thank you, sir. What the heck? Balloons? People, people! What are you doin'? We got a drought here, remember? You can't go throwing your money away! We're farmers! We grow corn and vegetables. Not balloons! Gimme that balloon. Could be a poisonous plant. Fine! You all wanna go broke, go ahead. This is wrong, Potter. Dead bug wrong. You're darn tootin' it's wrong. You owe me $10, Mr. Mayfield. Sue me, Potter. [ Mayor ] Excuse me. Hello. Can I have everybody's attention for a minute? I just got a phone call from a firm... Up in buxton. And, well, they're gonna send a man... Down here tomorrow to speak with US regarding the drought. So why don't we all meet tomorrow at the church at noon? Okay? All right, muffin. It's time for you to go to sleep. Daddy, why do you think balloons grew in waterston? I don't know, sweetheart. You have sweet dreams. What do you think, mama? I think it means that waterston is a very special place. - Good night. - Good night. Doesn't make me feel special. Makes me suspicious. Growing things without water, let alone balloons! You saw exactly what I saw. You touched 'em too. Yeah, I know. It's not every day that balloons grow! Casey, balloons don't grow. Hey, what's going on? What are you doing here? Did you just fly over here? You did, didn't you? Must be cold in that corner. You can stay here if you like. You can understand me? We can't tell nobody about this. No way. We gotta keep it our secret. Come on. [ Rooster crowing ] Who does he think he is? Mr. Fancy-shmancy farmer. Gettin' people all stirred up, actin' like fools. [ Woman ] Federal bureau of investigation. I'd like you to send some people down here... To investigate some strange happenings. Hey, it's him again. Yes, Mr. Mayfield. How can I help you, sir? We got a new farmer here, and he's growing... things. Ah, well, yes, sir. That is quite odd, a farmer growing things. Dang right, it's odd, with no water, in the middle of a drought. Uh-huh? And could you describe these things for me, sir? He's growing balloons. Good-bye, Mr. Mayfield. [ Phone disconnects ] Okay. Uh, okay, everybody. Let's give a warm waterston welcome to our visitor from buxton, Mr. Keiner. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you. Thank you. [ Applauding ] I represent a firm... That is interested in purchasing your land. I can offer you all very competitive prices, close to your original purchase value. But I do need your decisions this week. I'm leaving my business card here... So that anyone interested can contact me immediately. Thank you. My goodness. What does everybody think? I'd like to know what they want our land for. I think we're pretty lucky to get any kind of offer. That don't seem lucky to me. We either sell to him, or we get foreclosed on by the banks. Think about it. Balloons don't just grow. We ain't forgot about 'em. It's just we got a guillotine hanging over US right now. But they grew here in waterston. So, what are you saying, Casey? I think... That it's a sign. Casey, don't do this. - A sign? - Like we've been chosen? We are in the midst of the worst drought in 50 years, and some strange man comes into town... And starts growing balloons. Don't you think that seems a little timely? What if these balloons really do mean something? What if they are a sign... That things are about to change? Most of US have lived here our entire lives. Don't we owe it to ourselves and our families to at least see this thing through... And find out what it all means? - Maybe it is a sign that things are gonna get better. - Yeah. If those balloons ain't a sign, well, then, I ain't a libra. [ Laughing ] [ Mouthing word ] What? So, how do you know? Well, you can just feel it. How about this one? Out of the way. Let me through. I want to see what's going on. [ Sighs ] That's a good one. [ Wheezle ] People, come on. We're farmers. We don't pick seeds like this. Open your eyes. [ Man ] Get out of the way, you crazy old coot. Thanks, Earl. Bye, Earl. How ya doin'? Hey. Hey. Here you go. One cup of coffee, to go, on the house. [ Laughing ] Oh! Thank you. Bye, Harvey. Bye, Harvey. Bye, Harvey. [ Together ] Good-bye. Bye. Bye. Bye, bye. So, what do you want me to do? Well, it's gettin' late. You better get on home. I thought you wanted me to help? You already did. I don't see why you won't let me watch you plant them seeds. I'll see ya tomorrow. It isn't always what you see. It's what you believe. Harvey kicked me off his farm today. He did? Why was that? So she couldn't see how he's pullin' that trick on US. It ain't a trick, daddy. What do you think it is then? Magic? You think it's a sign like your mother says? I don't think so. I've really had it with this Potter guy. I have! I wish he would take his stupid balloons and go away already. I'll go talk to her. Sweetheart, I am sorry. Your balloon is not stupid, it's your daddy that's stupid. Forgive me? Daddy, if I tell you something, will you promise to keep it a secret? Sure... as long as I can tell somebody. [ Laughing ] What is it? Well, my orange balloon-- mm-hmm. It's alive. Oh, really? Yeah. It can fly around by itself, and it sleeps in my bed. It even understands me when I talk to it. You do believe me, don't you? Sure, I believe you. Between you and Potter, I don't know who's worse. Now what's wrong? He's telling Willow that her balloon is alive. You believe that? It's about time I had a little talk with Mr. Balloon farmer. No, you don't. That's all I need is for you to go stirrin' stuff up. [ Knocking at gate ] Mr. Potter. Call me Harvey. Harvey. You wanna come in? It seems we have a problem. Me and my husband Jake are concerned that you might be telling Willow... Something about her balloon being alive. I don't know anything about that-- you like lemonade? Uh, but-- what's that? Lemonade. You like lemonade? Oh. Well, sure. Would you like a glass? Like I was saying-- uh-- it's the sweetest, most tangy lemonade you'll ever taste. The secret's in the lemon. I pick it myself. You gotta make it pure. If you're patient, if you use it right, you got yourself a whole pitcher. You wanna have a little taste? Uh, well, um-- ooh. That is some good lemonade. Thank you. I wanted to thank you for all you've done to lift our spirits. We're all not doin' so good right now. But you and your balloons being here have really picked US up. Given US hope. Hope's good. Next time, why don't you bring that old boy, Mr. Johnson, over? Oh, Jake. Well, Jake ain't much for lemonade. He's a coffee man. Coffee. Lemonade? Yeah. But it was really good. Okay. We'll see about that. Whoa! Hey, Jake. How ya doin'? Mr. Potter. Call me Harvey. Yeah, Harvey. What I wanted to talk to you about is-- Casey? We had lemonade. Yes, I know. Listen, Mr. Potter. I'm not quite sure what you're up to here, but I cannot have you telling Willow that balloons are alive. Okay? I would appreciate it-- [ Sniffing ] What is that smell? All it takes is one good bean. Mmm. That has got to be the best cup of coffee I ever did have. Casey said, "my Jake's a coffee man." [ Chuckles ] [ Groaning ] Earl? Earl, don't even think about it. But I sure could use a hot bath. [ Groans ] Ahh. Oh, my! [ Laughing ] * [ Humming ] Oh, hey, balloon, balloon! Hey! [ Chuckles ] I'm trying to turn the faucet on. Hey! Get out of the way! Out! Out! [ Laughing ] You silly balloon! Hey! Hey! Come back here. Come back, you silly thing! Come back! How many times do you think I can run around this house? [ Laughing ] Come here! You bad thing! Hey, honey. You fixed your truck. I didn't fix it. It's not making that noise anymore. I know. I didn't touch it. Hey, you wanna wash it? [ Tom ] No. Federal bureau of investigation. He's at it again. You know, Mr. Mayfield, the f.B.I. Is no longer handling balloon farm cases. I suggest you take this up with the c.I.A. I called the c.I.A., the p.T.A., the n.B.A. And the Y.M.C.A. Good-bye, Mr. Mayfield. All right! I'll handle it myself. [ Slams phone down ] [ Snoring ] [ Snoring continues ] [ Snoring continues ] Ohh! Now-- what's going on here? Get away from me! Get away! What the-- [ Maggie ] Last pot of the day. And startin' tomorrow, I'm gonna have to limit everyone to two cups. That hurts, Maggie. Um, has anybody thought about... Those investors' offer? We've only got a few days left to think about it. Tom? Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh-- well, no. I-- I don't know, Jake. It's just that-- no, please don't say what I think you're gonna say. What? Well, if he don't wanna say it, I will. There's somethin' goin' on with those balloons! I'm at home yesterday, and my balloon just floats over... And rubs against my knuckles. I tell ya, my arthritis ain't been this good in 15 years. Well, I lost five pounds in two days. And I must say that I think my balloon has been a big part of it. - That's great, crystal. - [ Crystal ] Uh-huh. [ Tom ] You know that noise my truck's made the last couple years? Bah-dah-bah-dah. It wasn't all that bad. Well, my daughter's balloon landed on the hood, and... [ Clicks fingers ] Thing's runnin' slicker than slick. Now that you mention it, ever since I got my balloon, I don't know. I feel like a new woman and I wanna party! - All right, girl! - [ Laughing ] See? Casey was right. Those balloons are bringing US luck. Yeah, that's just great. But we got bigger problems here. We got a drought chokin' US to death. Or did you forget... Now that Potter's got you all brainwashed? A little word of advice. You might oughta stop swattin' those mosquitos with a hammer. Very funny. I was attacked. - By what? - The balloons! [ Laughing ] -Wait a second. You say he grew more? -That's exactly what I'm saying. [ Excited chattering ] Hey. Hey! We'll take my truck. Come on. Wait for me. I can't run in these shoes! Those people are dumber than a bucket of mud. [ Excited chattering ] [ Harvey ] Yeah, you got it here. All right, thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Take the one you want. I'm gonna buy two dozen! Thank you, now. Thank you, ma'am. Pick your favorite color. They're goin' fast. Thank you very much. Pick the one you want! Let's go. Get the color you want before it's gone. - Thank you very much. Your favorite color. -[ Balloon pops ] Hurry up. They're going fast. [ Mayor ] Can I have your attention, please? [ Clears throat ] For the light which you've brought US... In such dark times, and for the happiness that you've "cremated"-- [ laughing ] Created! It's an honor for me to present you... With this key to our town. Well, really, it's, it's not a key. It's a corncob. Thank you very much. Thank you, Harvey. Yeah! Pretty soon we'll be celebratin' for you, Casey. Your farm centennial's coming up. Yep, it sure is. Bye. See you later. Be good. [ Car doors closing ] You know what I think? All that talk between you and Willow... About the green people and the bloomin' blue grass and all, that's gone to your head. You can't deny it's very timely, and could quite possibly be true. I know what you're trying to do, Casey, and it's not right. You shouldn't be puttin' your silly thoughts into other people's heads... Just so you can reach your centennial. It's selfish. I'm not the selfish one. Yes, maybe it is a little crazy, but isn't that what hope is? What-- Ah, Jacob Johnson, you are losing your mind. [ Door banging ] Buxton savings bank. Harvey Potter. Yes, it's me again. I'm calling to see whether you're going forward with the foreclosures. Yeah? Well, that's great. The town? Nah, they have no idea. All right. Yes, thank you. Mr. and Mrs. Williams, I can assure you this is a very fair offer. I know you'll feel better when this is-- when it's all settled. Bye. What do you think? By the end of the week, they'll all sell. I hope so, because those waste companies aren't gonna wait forever. Hey, can you imagine the look on those farmers' faces... When they find out their land is gonna be used as a garbage dump? There are no faces here. Just names on a line. What is with the balloons in this town? [ Horn honking ] Hi. What happened? [ Laughing ] There! Now you look happy. Come on, orange! Orange! Got one! Yes! That one isn't orange. Got two, three, jackpot! Yeah, all right. There it is. Take a good look. I got the seed off the Potter himself. Planted it a few days ago, and here it is. No balloon stalks, no nothin'. Just what is it you're trying to say? That Potter is a fake! Don't go spreadin' your nasty rumors in here, wheezle Mayfield. Take a look at what's happenin', people. We're down on our luck. We got a drought here choking US to foreclosure. And Mr. Balloon farmer dang well knows it. But we think of it as a sign things are gonna change. No! We touched them. We felt them. We've seen them. It's not just some trick. And Dorothy saw the wizard with her own eyes. But was he real? Has anything changed really? Are we any better off? No! We've been conned, people. Conned! - [ Maggie ] Oh, no! - What's wrong, Willow? - I heard something bad the other day. - Tell US. We won't tell. [ Sighs ] Heard Harvey on the phone with the bank up in buxton. - He said something about a foreclosure. - See? I knew it! Willow Johnson said she heard Potter talkin' on the phone with the bank. Yeah? And? Was that true? Did you really hear him? Well, yeah, but-- [ Willow ] It's not his-- - I don't know. - This is terrible, people. Just terrible! I don't believe this! Well, I do. He's right! We've been had! Don't you think we're jumping to conclusions? Heck no. Your own daughter just confirmed everything. What more do you need? Some real proof! Not some runaway gossip. There's gotta be an explanation for it. And I just heard it. It all makes perfect sense now, Casey. We are about to lose our farm. I'm sorry. You made US believe once. But not again. And nothing... Has really changed! Tom! It's all my fault. No, it's not your fault, honey. Get off, you dang balloons. Go on, git! [ Charles ] I'm gonna pop all my balloons. How 'bout yours, Willow? Not mine! Willow! No! Hello, folks! I'm fresh out of balloons, but you're all welcome to come in. Don't "hello" US. We want our money back. You want your money back? [ Everyone ] Yeah. [ Potter ] Why? 'Cause you robbed US blind. We know all about your plan, you-- we don't want any trouble. And you can forget about your coffees to go. [ Crystal ] Yeah! So just give US back our money, and we'll be on our way. Of course, crystal. You'll all get a full refund. That's more like it. Well, that's better. - Just bring my balloons back. - [ Everyone murmuring ] Um, we ain't exactly got the balloons. No balloon, no refund. Sorry, folks. Oh, now, now, now, now! I'll take care of this. Ouch. It was just a balloon, Jake. You didn't need to get rid of it. I don't wanna talk about balloons. We got more important things to talk about. I got the offer from the investors. We can't afford to wait any longer. [ Jake sighs ] The balloons are not gonna save US. This right here, that's gonna save US. We really have no other choice. We're gonna have to sell, and that's final. Well. - I think that you're forgetting that it's my name on the deed. - Don't do this. - So I guess that means you don't have much of a decision. - I'm not thinking about myself. I'm thinking about how to feed my wife and my kid. [ Jake ] You're gonna bust up this family. I don't think that's what you want, but that is what you're doing. [ Footsteps approaching ] Hi, sweetheart. Listen, I'm sorry about your balloon. I really didn't have any choice. It would've been wrong to have kept it. What Mr. Potter did, it was just wrong. [ Sighs ] I'm sorry, sweetheart. Daddy? Yeah? Do you still love mama? Sure I do. We just haven't been seeing things eye-to-eye lately, that's all. I don't know why. We all start out as seeds. The trees, the corn, you, mama. We start out small, and we just keep growing and growing. You and mama are just growing. Well, that's how Harvey would put it. You have sweet dreams, okay, sweetheart? [ Sighs ] [ Siren wailing ] [ Wailing continues ] What are you doin'? This here road is closed. And being that it is closed, I'm gonna need to see your driver's license. You know I ain't got one. Seems like you haven't taken care of those plates, have you, Mr. Potter? No, sir. I want you to do me a favor. You want me to fix you a pie? It's good, isn't it? [ Clears throat ] No, I do not want you to make me a pie, Potter. I want you to leave. I want you to go away, far away. I live here. Nobody wants you around here, Potter. I'd throw you in jail... For what you've done to US, but I can't 'cause you ain't done nothing illegal. I suggest you go home, you pack up, and you leave. Or things could get sticky around here. Sticky. Like those pecans in the middle of those sticky little pecan pies of yours. Thank you. You have a nice day now. Only two days left on that investor's offer. Maybe we should've been selling balloons. "No balloons, no refund." He must think he's some kind of department store. We should've seen this coming from the start. How could we have? Jeez, sue, he was growing balloons, that's how. - Can I get a refill here? - Nope. You've already had your two cups today. - Come on, just one more? - No! You know the rules. - Like everybody else, you gotta cut back on your use of water. - Like you do? What's that supposed to mean? I guess washing your truck every day doesn't count. At least I don't make gallons of iced tea. Hey, that's for my diet. I need my iced tea. Yeah, to wash down the cake. Well, excuse me, Mr. Bubbles. How many gallons do you think that uses up? What are you talking about? About those baths you be takin'. Your skin's pruned to death every time I see you. Those are just wrinkles. Libra's wrinkle. [ Laughs ] That's it! Everybody stop the fightin' or get out. How in blazes could he know about me washing my truck? Maybe because it's always clean! Excuse me! Next time you're in that old, broke-down tub, why don't you try soakin' that big ol' head of yours? What's with everybody? It's Potter. He's ruined everything. It's about time we did something about it. Come on. Yeah! Do what? [ Girl #1 ] Give me a tomato! Come on! [ Girl #2 ] Throw me one. [ Boy #1 ] Good throw! It's him! [ Charles ] Grab your tomatoes! Let's go, let's get his truck! [ Shouting ] [ Shouting continues ] [ Yelling ] Here, Willow, throw it. [ Marcy ] Yeah, throw it, Willow. What are you doing, Willow? Throw it! No, you're wrong. Harvey's balloons are real. You're on his side! Well, fine! Eech! Sue, what happened? No! - They took everything. - Sue? Don't you come near me, Casey. This is all your fault. Having US spend our savings on those balloons! Because of you, Tom couldn't sell. He truly believed your nonsense. - But I just didn't think-- - you didn't think of anybody but yourself. But that's okay... Because you got a centennial to worry about. You okay? Jeez! No, I'm fine. No, I'm not fine. I, I wanna know why, Harvey. Why did you do this to US? I only wanted to help you. Sure. You conned US. You robbed US blind! You really believe that? You got what you came for. And now we have nothing. No, you just don't realize what you got. [ Jake ] That's great, sweetheart. I'm glad you came to your senses. It is the best thing in the long run. I don't wanna talk about it. Just call the investors and tell them we'll sell. You're gonna thank me for it. It really is the best thing. Okay. [ Jake ] Our house, it's like a landmark. It's nearly 100 years old. Hey, sweetie. How you doin'? It's very nice. Now tell me about this land out here. My property's from the road clear on up to the foothills. Very nice. We'll draw up an offer. We'll be in touch. Okay, thanks. We'll see ya. Mommy, you can't just give up now. Remember what you told me? That balloons just don't grow in any old place. We're special. You don't believe that anymore, do ya? [ Gasps ] You're back! I'm so glad you're back. I miss you so much. We got some big problems here. [ TV, indistinct ] The forecast, mostly sunny skies today with brisk easterly winds. What would Harvey do? Harvey would make something like... lemonade or a pie. Or he'd grow something. That's it! [ Kisses balloon ] [ Whispering ] I hope we're doing the right thing. [ Willow screams ] [ Bell jingles ] [ Gasps ] * [ Humming ] [ Seeds splattering ] [ Willow ] Oops. [ Grunting ] It's too heavy. We're never gonna make it. What are you doin'? Wow. Hurry up. Come on. Oh, no! We lost all the seeds. There's gotta be one in here somewhere. Please, find one. What would Harvey do if he only had one seed? Harvey would use what he had. I've got it! Oh, great. It's locked. What do we do now? Oh, wow! [ Laughs ] It's stuck. Can you help me? Thanks. All right! Yes, it's working! It's working! Yes, yes! This better work. We're gonna be in a lot of trouble. [ Inhales ] [ Knocking on door ] Potter. [ Water sprinkler spraying, rooster crows ] Oh, no! [ Water gurgling ] [ Cell phone rings ] Sheriff. [ Ringing continues ] Sheriff. W-Wheezle, slow down. * [ Humming ] [ Phone rings ] Mama, daddy, it came back. My balloon came back. Hi, mama. Daddy. - Willow, what have you done? - What do you mean? I just got a call from the sheriff. Said somebody drained the reservoir-- listen, it's not what you think. Just let me explain. [ Knocking at door ] Oh! Hey, come on in. Hello, Mr. Johnson. I just tried to-- Mrs. Johnson. All the paperwork is ready. All it needs is your name on that line. I have a pen right here. Right there. Mm-hmm. Willow, go to your room. No! [ Siren wailing ] [ Casey ] Willow? Sorry about this. You just stay put. We'll straighten it out. Willow Johnson! Whoa! She's off to Potter's! [ Jake ] Casey, hop in. [ Siren wailing ] [ Laughing ] [ Laughing ] [ Laughing ] Wow. It worked! It really worked! Harvey! Harvey! They grew! Harvey, these aren't regular balloons. Yeah, they sure aren't. There he is! There's the crook! All right, Potter, you're under arrest for illegal use of water. That's right. You're done, Potter. You're done. And you, little missy, have some serious explaining to do. Our water. Harvey didn't do nothing. It was me. I drained the reservoir. [ Boy ] Man, why'd you do that? So you leave him outta this. These balloons that you're so upset about, they're what we've been waiting for, they're our sign. [ Siren wailing ] [ Jake ] What's goin' on? F.b.i. We'll take it from here. Well, it's about time. [ Man ] You kids go back. [ Boy ] What is it, dad? What are they doing? What is going on here? [ Jake ] I can't believe we have-- - Willow, come back here! - Get her! [ Jake ] Willow! Yeah! The balloons! Oh, my gosh! [ Mayor ] Look! Ah, Willow, you did good! [ Harvey ] Ah, yeah! [ Chattering ] Freeze! Do not approach the balloon. Hand it to me. It belongs to US now. [ Grunting ] Yeah! [ Thunderclaps ] Hey! Hey, hey! [ Laughing ] Yes, it worked! It worked! Yeah! They weren't pods after all. No, they were water balloons. Totally cool, Willow. Water balloons rule! Come on, let's go. Here we go. Ahhh! Ah, sweetheart, I am so sorry I didn't listen to you. Jake, I was so worried! I didn't know if it was Willow or not. I didn't know what was gonna happen. You were right. I told you those balloons were special. Ah, sweetheart, you sure did. You made it rain, Willow. Not so fast, you two. We had a deal, Mr. Johnson. Your wife signed that contract. We've changed our minds. The deal was-- Willow, give him the contract. Let me take a look at that. Ha! I knew it. He's in cahoots... With the bank. This is just a big smudge. I can't see any name on this contract. What about you, Jake? Nothing. Well, I'm sorry. Sorry, nothing! You can't just back out now. None of you can! I've got 20 different waste companies breathing down my neck. Waste companies? Sounds like he was gonna use our farms... For dump sites. And this waste wouldn't happen to be toxic now, would it? Of course not! Garbage man! I guess you wouldn't mind... If my boys took a look at your paperwork on them companies. But, but-- paperwork? I think you should come with US. You're goin' bye, bye, bye with the f.B.I.! Take him away, men. [ Keiner ] Get your hands off me! What do you think you're doing? [ Laughing ] [ Mayor ] Good job, sheriff. What? My property's dry as a bone! They all sure believed him. Maybe I should have too. [ Thunderclaps ] [ Laughing ] - I'll be leaving now. - Leavin'? - [ Earl ] What? - Harvey, no! Why, Harvey? Well, it's time to move on. Please stay, Harvey. We need you here to grow more balloons. You don't need my balloons now. You got your farms back. You've got each other. So long, Harvey. Thank you. That's for being crazy. I'm countin' on you to keep things right here. I'm gonna miss ya, Harvey. I'm gonna miss you too, Willow. This is for your friends, the williamses. You bought their farm back from the bank? With what? With the balloon money! He was calling the bank. Why didn't you just tell US 'cause sometimes, it's not what you see, it's what you believe. Make sure you catch them before they leave in the morning. Okay. Bye, Harvey. Bye now. Bye, Harvey. Bye, Harvey. We'll miss you. Bye-bye. Thank you, Harvey. [ Willow ] Bye, Harvey. [ Horn honking ] I'm so glad I caught you. What do you want, Casey? Just a little something from everybody. Harvey brought US this rain. Jake. Welcome back. How 'bout this? Doesn't look like it's gonna let up anytime soon, does it? [ Laughing ] No, it sure don't! Hi! Honey, you look beautiful! Well, everybody's here. Immediate seating to your left. I mean, right. Look, look, crystal. Crystal, come here. Look at this. Look at who's dancing. Everybody over there is having such a good time. [ Charles ] Wow, this is a great party. Everyone's here. Willow, now that Harvey's gone, you gonna tell US how to grow a balloon? I just use what I have. Hey, you guys thirsty for some lemonade? Sure, but it's gonna take more than one lemon to make lemonade. Not the way I make it. Come on. Duh! Hey, guys, she's got a new trick! [ Marcy ] Yeah, come on. Let's see what she's doing.
