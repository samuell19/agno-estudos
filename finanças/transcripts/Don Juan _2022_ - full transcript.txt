Thank you for waiting. ﻿Julie won't be long. ﻿We'll listen to a tune she loves while we wait. ﻿Some already know it, ﻿but those who don't know her ﻿will get to know her a little ﻿through music. ﻿It's a good way to know someone, I think. ﻿Laurent! ﻿What's going on, Julie? ﻿Where are you? ﻿What'll it be? ﻿Music. ﻿What? ﻿Serve me some music. ﻿One love always counts more than the others. ﻿I'm glad I never knew it. I'm free. ﻿At your age? ﻿Yes. So what? ﻿We need to know what we love. ﻿Yes, and I know. ﻿The buffet is open. ﻿What's going on? ﻿Is someone there? ﻿Excuse me! ﻿You're in a happy mood ﻿That's a dangerous attitude ﻿In this world so full of hate ﻿Are you trying to tempt fate? ﻿You tend to smile ﻿Do you realize? ﻿You tend to smile. What's that in your eyes? ﻿You're in a happy mood ﻿A dangerous attitude ﻿I've been watching you ﻿Do you do it to annoy me too? ﻿How dare you? ﻿Shit, how dare you? ﻿You have no right. To be happy in my sight ﻿Your joy isn't rational ﻿Your joy makes me feel abnormal ﻿Most people are sad. Your joy drives me mad ﻿You're in a happy mood ﻿A dangerous attitude ﻿You look happy to be alive ﻿It makes my envy thrive ﻿I was going to celebrate my wedding here. ﻿I've kept the room. ﻿Who are you? ﻿Can you help me? ﻿To do what? ﻿To forget. ﻿Forget what? ﻿Love. ﻿Farewell ﻿Haven't we met? ﻿Come on. ﻿What? ﻿Come. ﻿Who's this sicko? ﻿The colour of your eyes changes near the sea. ﻿It becomes lighter, right? ﻿And, in the sun ﻿what colour are they? ﻿Seen them? Now get lost. ﻿I've seen them, yes. ﻿So I'll keep mine closed. ﻿Promise. ﻿Imagine... ﻿Just imagine, you and me in an embrace. ﻿A tight embrace. ﻿What a dickhead. ﻿Keep the change. ﻿The gentleman. ﻿What? ﻿I can't offer you a drink? ﻿Not even that? ﻿A simple drink? ﻿You're in a happy mood ﻿It's a dangerous attitude ﻿You act like I'm not in your class ﻿If you won't even accept one glass ﻿What? ﻿I can't offer you a drink? ﻿Not even that? ﻿A simple drink? ﻿Most people are so sad ﻿If I insist, is that bad? ﻿Can't I offer you some bubbles? ﻿In the vain hope of forgetting my troubles ﻿What? ﻿I can't offer you a drink? ﻿Not even that? ﻿A simple drink? ﻿Not even ﻿Two or three little glasses? ﻿Not even ﻿Four or five little glasses? ﻿Not even ﻿Six or seven little glasses? ﻿The woman I love left me. ﻿Without a word. ﻿It's hell, I see her everywhere. ﻿Try to forget. ﻿But has Julie... ﻿No, nothing. ﻿Are you here as a friend or as a manager? ﻿More than a manager, less than a friend. ﻿Good to see you again. ﻿It'll be fine. ﻿Laurent... ﻿I wanted you to know that Naël told me. ﻿It must still be painful. ﻿Thank you for being here with us. ﻿Come and meet Marina. ﻿Hello. ﻿I'm glad to work with you. ﻿It'll go well, you'll see. ﻿I hope so. ﻿Why is it open? ﻿No idea, I'm not the director. I think she likes nature. ﻿Nature? ﻿You defend yourself so poorly for a courtier ﻿who must be accustomed to such things. ﻿I pity you in your confusion. ﻿Madam, I have not the talent to deceive. ﻿I may not feel the same passion for you... ﻿Laurent, thanks. ﻿Marina, try it again. ﻿Your Elvire is a helpless little thing. ﻿You don't suffer, you whimper. ﻿We feel Don Juan is right to mistreat you. ﻿Upstanding. ﻿Proud. ﻿Go on. ﻿You defend yourself so poorly for a courtier ﻿who must be accustomed to such things. ﻿I pity you in your confusion... ﻿Try it again, less stiff. ﻿You defend yourself so poorly for a courtier ﻿who must be accustomed to such things. ﻿I pity you... ﻿Don't do it as if she were begging Don Juan. ﻿She's lecturing him. ﻿Do it as if she were in control of things. ﻿You defend yourself so poorly for a courtier ﻿who must be accustomed to such things. ﻿I pity you in your confusion. ﻿Let her work it out. ﻿What's the problem? ﻿To marry you, I violated ﻿the sanctity of a convent. ﻿Heaven is resentful of such acts. ﻿Repentance seized me, with fear of celestial wrath. ﻿I believed... ﻿I believed our marriage was but adultery. ﻿You found it... ﻿Thanks, I'm fond of it. It was a gift. ﻿A gift? ﻿From someone you're fond of? ﻿You could say that. ﻿Thank you for... ﻿Just how fond of him are you? ﻿I love him. ﻿And? ﻿May I have my scarf? ﻿You're negligent. ﻿How can love live with negligence? Try to focus. ﻿Do you have a problem? ﻿I'll give it back ﻿in return for a night. ﻿I need love, you need your scarf. ﻿We could help each other. ﻿Without any negligence. ﻿What a maniac! ﻿Sganarelle! ﻿Heaven. ﻿We care not about such matters. ﻿Madam... ﻿Enough, I'll hear no more. ﻿I feel I've heard too much. It's cowardice ﻿when such knowledge can only make me despair. ﻿But know that your crime will not go unpunished. ﻿I know what Don Juan does is bad. ﻿He makes women unhappy, yes. ﻿But when I play a character ﻿I don't judge or defend him. ﻿I just try to bring him to life. ﻿You seek excuses for him. ﻿How can I explain? ﻿Maybe your teacher can help. ﻿Why doesn't she intervene? ﻿You introduce yourself to a guest doing a reading, ﻿you understand? ﻿I was asked to do a reading to show how I work, ﻿Not to analyse a text. I'm no teacher. ﻿I'll ask you a question. ﻿Do you like evil characters? ﻿Yes. ﻿If Don Juan was "nicer" to women, ﻿what then? ﻿He'd be less interesting? ﻿Yes, exactly. ﻿So what makes him interesting? ﻿The fact that we're wrong ﻿in putting Don Juan on one side ﻿and women on the other. ﻿As if we had to side with him or with them. ﻿We mustn't view things separately. ﻿Don Juan alone isn't interesting, no more than the women. ﻿What do they expect when he seduces them? ﻿Fleeting physical satisfaction? ﻿What does he expect in seducing them? ﻿Fleeting physical satisfaction? ﻿So we need a common answer to the two questions. ﻿his relations with each woman are. ﻿Any ideas? ﻿Come on. ﻿No, but I have a question for the actor. ﻿In the play, Don Juan keeps dumping women. ﻿But no woman ever dumps him? ﻿Pick up your things. ﻿You seem destabilized by their questions. ﻿Every question is legitimate. ﻿Why doesn't a woman ever dump Don Juan? ﻿That's tough. ﻿Could you answer it? ﻿Because they love him. ﻿A woman who leaves a man no longer loves him? ﻿That's no major discovery. ﻿You're not very talkative. ﻿So you're playing Don Juan? ﻿That's odd. ﻿It's a great role I never played. ﻿I'm focusing very hard. ﻿Your act at the bar... Was that you focusing? ﻿Not an act. ﻿I happen to have lost someone ﻿and I thought... ﻿Never mind. Give me a minute. ﻿Wait over there. ﻿Thank you. ﻿You must help me. You've seen how rehearsals are going? ﻿It's a tough role, that's all. ﻿You realize I need your help? ﻿That's not a good idea. ﻿Please. ﻿Please. ﻿Go to your room and trust yourself. ﻿So prove you want to help me. ﻿Don't let me down, please. ﻿You mix things up. ﻿Focus on the work. ﻿Why do you step closer? ﻿That's enough. ﻿You won't give me anything. ﻿And you lecture me with your cliches about work and focusing. ﻿I know it's your debut and it's a tough role, but with work... ﻿I don't want your "experienced actor" lessons. ﻿You have to focus. ﻿- Again? - Yes, be serious. ﻿Your partner carries a burden for you. ﻿Your seriousness and focus crush everything. ﻿I can't act if you're so rigid. ﻿I've nothing to lean on, nothing to drive me, no opening. ﻿That's the problem. Not me, you. ﻿You're blocking me! ﻿Don't you recognize me? ﻿We met the other day. ﻿It's for you. ﻿Thank you. ﻿You're thinking of a woman. ﻿Yes. ﻿What? ﻿Her father was a bar pianist. ﻿Papa on the keys ﻿Playing like a breeze ﻿She found it pretty, see ﻿Papa 's melody ﻿She loved that air ﻿Played with flair ﻿By Papa on the keys ﻿She loved listening to him. ﻿What else did she love? ﻿Living. ﻿What is living? Give me an example. ﻿Walking at night. ﻿All alone? ﻿With me. ﻿And?﻿ ﻿She often said I was too serious. ﻿Were you happy together? ﻿Yes. ﻿For the first time. ﻿Meaning? ﻿I'd never known that. ﻿Really? ﻿Have you had many women in your life? ﻿Yes. ﻿Before her, I couldn't choose. ﻿It's odd. ﻿Love... ﻿Are you making fun? ﻿No, I'm not making fun ﻿Without love we're nothing ﻿Truly nothing ﻿You do acting. ﻿Right? ﻿How did you know? ﻿It was quite a sight. Your act the other night ﻿That scarf so light. Like you were acting ﻿As if this life here below ﻿Were all one big show ﻿Egocentric. Playful and indecent ﻿Such are the characteristics. For acting ﻿Very observant. ﻿it's true. People interest me. I like to watch them. ﻿Are you Don Juan in the play? ﻿Yes. ﻿How do you work? ﻿I don't know your profession, so I'm interested. ﻿How do I work? ﻿By focusing. ﻿That's not very original. ﻿Lots of "workers" focus. ﻿Never mind. ﻿Being too curious leads to dissatisfaction. ﻿I'll go to see the play. ﻿To see you work. ﻿Maybe that'll answer my question. ﻿Goodbye. ﻿What do you want? ﻿What do you want? ﻿Piss off! ﻿You heard, son of a bitch. ﻿Right? ﻿Right? ﻿I'll show you then. ﻿Asshole! ﻿Julie! ﻿I can't do it. Help me. ﻿I'm no makeup artist. ﻿Please. ﻿Marina has left. ﻿Her replacement's here. ﻿They're waiting. ﻿Why are you so uneasy? ﻿Let's go! ﻿...Laurent! Finally... ﻿What's that makeup? ﻿Let me see. ﻿What happened? ﻿It's nothing. An accident. ﻿It's complicated. ﻿I understand. ﻿All right. ﻿Elvire is presentable at least. ﻿And ready to act. ﻿Ready to act? ﻿Will you be good enough, Don Juan, to recognize me? ﻿May I at least hope you will deign to look this way? ﻿Will you be good enough, Don Juan, to recognize me? ﻿May I at least hope you will deign to look this way? ﻿Few people could take on the part at the drop of a hat. ﻿Julie already played Elvire a few years ago. ﻿She's already getting into the role, ﻿right away. It's surprising. ﻿You should go through the lines with her. ﻿Come ﻿Can we get started? ﻿What's going on? ﻿Nothing. We're working, that's all. ﻿Laurent, what are you imagining ﻿You don't just fire an actor. ﻿Julie... ﻿What's going on? ﻿I know I was a little harsh earlier. ﻿But remember what I said? ﻿In an emergency, work comes first. ﻿I had to find a new Elvire fast. ﻿Picking Marina was risky. ﻿I knew it from the start, but thought it was a risk worth taking. ﻿A young and inexperienced Elvire, ﻿with her sorrow and premature comprehension... ﻿Someone who knows nothing but who suddenly understands it all. ﻿Just through suffering... ﻿Gotta go. ﻿Why did ﻿Why did ﻿Why did you ﻿Why did you abandon me? ﻿Why? ﻿Why? ﻿Do I even know? ﻿Why are you cursing me? ﻿Why does what happens come to be? ﻿Why do I no longer believe ﻿In what made me live and breathe? ﻿Why does life desert its track ﻿Because of the slightest crack? ﻿Why with joy in the air ﻿Must men go looking elsewhere? ﻿Why sing of love ﻿When it gives you the shove? ﻿Why keep saying it's so great ﻿When it's the rule of fate? ﻿Why? Why? Why? ﻿Why keep saying it's so great ﻿When it's the rule of fate? ﻿Why with joy in the air ﻿Must men go looking elsewhere? ﻿Why sing of love when it gives you the shove? ﻿Don't ask me why ﻿I know no more ﻿Than you do ﻿Ah! Monsieur Dimanche, come in. ﻿I'm delighted to see you ﻿and angry that my servants did not admit you right away. ﻿I left orders not to be disturbed. They were not meant for you. ﻿You may... ﻿Come on, let us feel Don Juan's joy ﻿in playing a dirty trick. ﻿I don't want... ﻿Ah! Monsieur Dimanche, ﻿come in. I'm delighted to see you ﻿and angry that my servants did not admit you right away. ﻿I left orders not to be disturbed! ﻿They were not meant for you. ﻿No. What's going on? ﻿Monsieur Dimanche, ﻿come in. ﻿I'm delighted to see you ﻿and angry that my servants did not admit you right away. ﻿I left orders not to be disturbed. ﻿They were not meant for you. ﻿But you may.. ﻿My presence embarrasses you ﻿and you would gladly forgo my visit. ﻿To tell the truth, we strangely disturb each other ﻿and if you are weary of me, I am as weary of your behaviour. ﻿Are you going to ask? ﻿Ask what? ﻿Yes, I didn't come. ﻿You dumped me in front of everyone. ﻿And? ﻿You didn't have the decency to do it in private. ﻿You needed an audience. ﻿And I looked ridiculous. ﻿In my grey tuxedo. ﻿Not grey, black. ﻿It wasn't a big audience. ﻿It was a grey day. ﻿You stopped near a statue. ﻿The wind messed up your hair when you called me. ﻿Yes, I was there. ﻿I parked, I ran, I was late, but I was there. ﻿I came towards the town hall. ﻿You were at the window. ﻿Yes. ﻿I remember. I looked along the street for you. ﻿I was worried. I looked for you. ﻿You looked at a woman. ﻿For a long moment. ﻿A passer-by. ﻿No, I was looking for you. ﻿It was that look you give all women. ﻿It was just a look at a passerby. ﻿It was nothing. ﻿Nothing at all. ﻿You mythicize things. ﻿You always want to believe amazing things happen to you, ﻿but we're ordinary. ﻿Both of us. ﻿Ordinary. ﻿You mythicize what happens. ﻿That's how trouble arises and, after... ﻿After, it's too late. ﻿I have something to say about Laurent. ﻿We're not close, but we appreciate each other. ﻿I'm sorry, but I overheard what he said. ﻿What you saw on the wedding day... ﻿On his wedding day... ﻿That morning, with him at the window. ﻿All that about a look. ﻿I was there. ﻿I saw it too. He was acting. ﻿Acting? ﻿Don't you ever do that? ﻿It's a special moment, you have to isolate yourself ﻿and if someone passes you, ﻿you put yourself in their skin. ﻿Whose skin? ﻿That other person's. ﻿A stranger's. ﻿You imagine you're the person ﻿you're looking at. ﻿So you perform without lines, ﻿without a partner. ﻿It's here. ﻿In your mind. ﻿He does it all the time. ﻿He can't stop himself. He acts all alone. ﻿Try it yourself now. ﻿Enter his mind. ﻿Put yourself in his place. ﻿Get inside him, bit by bit. ﻿When he looks at a woman, he imagines being with her. ﻿See the difference? ﻿I know him better. ﻿Maybe not, Julie. ﻿Maybe not. ﻿Love you. ﻿Well? ﻿Spying on me? ﻿You have the key? ﻿An actress can obtain anything. ﻿You want to act? ﻿Come on. ﻿To marry you, I violated the sanctity of a convent. ﻿Heaven is resentful of such acts. ﻿Repentance seized me, with fear of celestial wrath. ﻿I believed our marriage ﻿was but adultery in disguise, drawing disgrace on us, ﻿and that, finally ﻿I should try to forget you ﻿and let you return to your first chains. ﻿Would you, Madam, oppose such simple thoughts ﻿and bear heaven's burden... ﻿Wretch! ﻿Now I know you for who you really are. ﻿But, to my misfortune, I have learned too late ﻿when such knowledge can only make me despair. ﻿But know that your crime will not go unpunished ﻿and that the heaven you mock ﻿will avenge me for your perfidy. ﻿Sganarelle! Heaven! ﻿We've got it. ﻿We've finally got it. ﻿There's something in your performance that's more... ﻿- Open? - Yes, exactly. ﻿Come and celebrate. ﻿I don't want to go. ﻿I want you for myself. ﻿I realized something tonight. ﻿What? ﻿How can I say it? ﻿You act better than me. ﻿Don't be absurd. ﻿It's true. ﻿I realized tonight as we acted. ﻿That's why I stopped a second. ﻿Remember? ﻿I couldn't go on. ﻿It was like a revelation. ﻿What are you looking at? ﻿Often lovers stay focused on each other ﻿Often a lover looks only at the other ﻿But on the contrary ﻿My eyes are open and see ﻿The world around and much more ﻿That before I never saw ﻿I was struck blind ﻿But now suddenly ﻿With you back at my side I find ﻿That can see ﻿I see colours and tones ﻿I see every detail ﻿In the heart's deepest zones ﻿I see through the walls of a jail ﻿Now you love me again ﻿I see it all ﻿Now you love me again ﻿I see it all ﻿I see that you're better than me ﻿I see that you act better than me ﻿I see it when we're on stage ﻿It's so obvious, it's an outrage ﻿So I sing ﻿It's the only thing I do better than you ﻿So I sing ﻿I sing for you ﻿My father was a pianist. You knew that. ﻿And fickle. ﻿That, you didn't know. ﻿What? A person like you ﻿is married to a humble peasant? ﻿No. ﻿No, no. ﻿That profanes such beauty. ﻿Profanes such beauty. ﻿You weren't born to live in a village! ﻿Heaven, through its schemes ﻿no doubt led me here on purpose to prevent ﻿this wedding. ﻿We don't work on Sunday. ﻿I think I want a child. ﻿You never said that before. ﻿It's a bit late. ﻿Think. ﻿Think for once before speaking. ﻿We can always try. ﻿I love the smell of you. ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿I was driving by with my woman and saw you. ﻿So I followed you. ﻿Has she come back? ﻿Yes. ﻿Really? ﻿I came back to see my daughter. ﻿Your daughter? ﻿I lost her. ﻿Because of you. ﻿You abandoned her. ﻿I left her. ﻿What's the difference? ﻿Love may not last a lifetime. ﻿Couples part every day. ﻿It's not tragic. ﻿It's ordinary. ﻿It's not my fault. ﻿Can you swear to that? ﻿Yes. ﻿Why is she buried here? ﻿She loved the sea. ﻿But why here exactly? ﻿As you feel you've done no wrong ﻿we'll meet again soon, as friends. ﻿We'll celebrate love. ﻿I can't wait. ﻿We'll talk about all this. ﻿We'll get to the bottom of it. ﻿To my daughter, Delphine, died January 28,2015 ﻿What should a father say ﻿To young girls who are going away? ﻿I wanted her to trust ﻿Trust in life ﻿What should a father say ﻿To young girls who are going away? ﻿I wanted her to trust ﻿Trust in life ﻿But not trust in him ﻿Her smile was so sweet ﻿As if it were a treat ﻿For life ﻿But why him? ﻿He, the actor so slick ﻿Forever egocentric ﻿Why did he have to be ﻿The one she fell for so quick? ﻿Often a lover looks only at the other ﻿Her smile was so sweet ﻿But my words were too discreet ﻿My little dear ﻿Too late now ﻿Never again will she be near ﻿I'm expecting someone. ﻿You like music, don't you? ﻿Like your father. ﻿Did you know my father? ﻿I know a lot. Everything interests me. ﻿You're an actress, aren't you? ﻿I saw you in Don Juan. ﻿I liked you very much. ﻿Thank you. ﻿But I didn't like your partner. ﻿He doesn't have your liberty. He acts petty, dry, sour... ﻿I love acting with him. ﻿Really? Why? ﻿Do you truly love him? ﻿Yes. ﻿Wonderful... ﻿And does he love you? ﻿Yes. ﻿That's so beautiful. ﻿Bravo. ﻿Will he always love you? ﻿My daughter wasn't that lucky. ﻿She wasn't that lucky? ﻿Sorry, the melody distracted me. I ﻿meant she wasn't lucky enough to be loved for long. ﻿What did you think I meant? ﻿I thought you might tell me something. ﻿A secret, or some tragedy. ﻿I wouldn't dare. ﻿A tragedy... ﻿No, she just thought the man she loved could change. ﻿But she was wrong. ﻿She was too trusting, you mean? ﻿Yes, but she was my daughter. ﻿I'd have liked to pass on trust in life. ﻿It was for her trust that I loved and raised her. ﻿It was important for me. ﻿Do you think people can change? ﻿That's a very general topic. ﻿It goes beyond me. ﻿I have to go, I'm expected. ﻿I'm sorry about your daughter. ﻿I wish you a lot of happiness. ﻿And a lot of trust. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Sorry. ﻿Will we make it this time? ﻿I think so. ﻿Ask me whatever you want. ﻿I'll just be a minute. ﻿Julie... ﻿Come back quick. ﻿I'm so clumsy. ﻿Leave it. Sit down. ﻿Everything ok? ﻿Fine. I was daydreaming. ﻿About what? ﻿I don't know. ﻿I'd like to know. ﻿I don't remember. ﻿I admire my simplicity ﻿and my soft-heartedness ﻿in doubting a betrayal confirmed by so much evidence. ﻿I was generous, I confess, ﻿or foolish, rather, ﻿in wanting to deceive myself ﻿and in seeking to contradict my eyes ﻿and judgement. ﻿Each day, my sound suspicions spoke to me, ﻿yet I spurned what rendered you criminal to my eyes. ﻿Speak, Don Juan, I beg you ﻿and let us see how you justify yourself. ﻿Heaven! ﻿What do I feel? ﻿An invisible fire burns me. ﻿I cannot go on. ﻿My body is an inferno! ﻿You're so pale... ﻿Hold me tight. ﻿Julie, will you come to my wedding? ﻿Yes. ﻿When did you decide? ﻿It was sudden. ﻿Naël was in a hurry. ﻿Why aren't you in bed yet? ﻿I'm not sleepy. ﻿I like that tune. ﻿My father used to play it. ﻿Better, of course. ﻿I thought he became a bar pianist ﻿to meet new women every night. ﻿He gave me a taste for music. ﻿And a distaste for seducers. ﻿Why tell me all that? ﻿I've had too much to drink. ﻿So I tell my life story. ﻿Actors are so self-centred and indecent. ﻿My little girl, do not cry ﻿He'd sing that to me. ﻿Sometimes, I had to go with him and I'd fall asleep under the piano ﻿When we got home, I couldn't sleep. ﻿So he'd sing the same song. ﻿I don't know if it's a nice memory. ﻿I don't think so. ﻿He sang this... ﻿Always. ﻿My little girl, don't cry ﻿My little girl, never fear ﻿Listen to your dad My little girl never fear ﻿The black truck with headlights ﻿That passes on all nights ﻿Rumbling beneath our window ﻿As vue watch it go ﻿Never fear those slippery tracks ﻿Where even adults fall on their backs ﻿You will fall my dear. And get up without a tear ﻿Your dad has fallen too ﻿Falling is nothing new. Listen to your dad ﻿My little girl don't be sad ﻿The one speaking is your dad ﻿But he isn't feeling mad ﻿The one speaking ﻿Is your dad ﻿He's your dad ﻿Who loves you ﻿Never fear the black truck with headlights ﻿That passes on all nights ﻿Rumbling beneath our window ﻿As we watch it go ﻿Never fear those slippery tracks ﻿Where even adults fall on their backs ﻿I'm late. ﻿What's on your mind? ﻿Nothing. ﻿You like to watch. ﻿Thanks to you, I told you. ﻿You show me the world. ﻿If you say so. ﻿You make me see it differently. ﻿If you say so. ﻿Like my outfit? ﻿Does it ring a bell? ﻿I think Naël is jittery. ﻿Well, he's getting married. It's wonderful. ﻿What do you think? ﻿I'm glad you made me come. ﻿What an idiot! ﻿I forgot my speech. ﻿I really wanted to give one. ﻿I'll go to the hotel and be right back. ﻿A speech? You hate speeches. ﻿That's weird. ﻿- You'll hurry back? - Right away. ﻿See you later. ﻿I wish you a lot of happiness. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Bravo. ﻿Thank you. ﻿I'd like my wedding to Julie this autumn to be as good. ﻿With the sea close by. ﻿But Julie prefers the city. ﻿We haven't decided yet. ﻿What do you say? City or sea? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Tonight it's my wedding. I ﻿like flowers. ﻿Marry me. Let us be twelve months ﻿Twenty-four hours out of twenty-three... ﻿Who's this fellow? ﻿Laurent invited me. ﻿Welcome then. ﻿Violet. ﻿An unconventional colour. ﻿- Do you like it? - Violets... ﻿My daughter's favourite flower. ﻿Your daughter... ﻿Oh, if only you knew... ﻿There's so much love here. ﻿It's overwhelming. ﻿Even the moon above your head is... ﻿You can't imagine... ﻿I'll invite you too. I don't know... ﻿It's me. ﻿I didn't have the courage earlier. ﻿How can I explain ﻿I wish I could have played music for you. ﻿It would have been clearer, ﻿more evocative than ridiculous, trite words. ﻿I'm ridiculous, I know, and you're waiting for me. ﻿It's over. ﻿You, me, acting together. It's over. ﻿Now I know you for who you really are. ﻿But to my misfortune, I've learned too late ﻿when such knowledge can only make me despair. ﻿It's because of the scarf! ﻿A teacher doesn't wear such a scarf. ﻿It confused the students. ﻿You were a redhead. ﻿You seem younger. I don't understand. ﻿Always laughing like an idiot. ﻿At the hotel. The lights went out. ﻿You hit me! ﻿It left scars on my face. ﻿You were listening to music. ﻿It's you. ﻿Asshole! ﻿Thank you. ﻿You don't treat women that way. ﻿What women? ﻿All of them. ﻿You're late. ﻿That's true. Sorry. ﻿You should say one last word to the audience, ﻿Don Juan. ﻿This old gentleman ﻿is the father of a woman I loved. ﻿He addresses me as "Don Juan". ﻿I perceive the irony. ﻿But it doesn't affect me. ﻿I'm just an actor. ﻿In life, I don't act. ﻿This old gentleman ﻿makes allusions to the theatre, ﻿wedding of two people I like a lot. ﻿And I'm not alone. ﻿Lots of women came back to celebrate this wedding with ﻿Tonight ﻿I will dance with them. ﻿And, above all, with one woman who will be back soon too. ﻿I'm sure of it. ﻿She had prepared a speech ﻿and I'm making one instead. ﻿It's strange. ﻿So let him look at us and break glasses if he likes! ﻿Julie will be back. ﻿I'm just an actor. ﻿Cheers! ﻿Just an actor. ﻿There... ﻿I've finished. ﻿I'll wait for Julie. I feel a bit... ﻿Did you like the play? ﻿The actress above all. ﻿Why? ﻿She can play anything. ﻿What does that mean? ﻿She can play all women. ﻿What does that mean exactly? ﻿She's not a one-role actress. ﻿Are there really one-role actors? ﻿Yes. ﻿Really? ﻿How do you know? ﻿Is it your profession? ﻿Not anymore. ﻿Were you an actor before? ﻿We'll leave you. ﻿I BELIEVE ﻿IN YOU NO LONGER
