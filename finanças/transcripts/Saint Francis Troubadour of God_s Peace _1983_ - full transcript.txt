Like the sun, he shone by his words and his works, upon a world lying torpid amid wintry cold, darkness and sterility, lighting it up with radiant sparks, illuminating it with the rays of truth, setting it afire with charity and renewing and embellishing it with the abundant fruit of his merits. Thus, did he bring the world to a kind of season of spring. (bright music) The father of the blessed and evangelical man, Francis was named Peter, Pietro, the son of the merchant, Bernardone and he was absorbed in making money. On the other hand, Francis' mother, Pica, was an excellent woman and she gave birth to a blessed son in the absence of his father, who happened to go to France on business. When Peter returned from France, he insisted that his son should be called Francis, Francesco. After the country he had recently left. Francis grew up quick and clever, and he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a merchant. In business, however, he was very different from Peter, being far more high spirited, and open handed. He was also intent on games and songs and day and night, he roamed about the city of Assisi with companions of his own age. He was a spendthrift and all that he earned went into eating and carousing with his friends. For this, his parents often remonstrated with him saying, "Francesco, in squandering such a large sums of money" "on yourself and others, your style of living" "makes you appear not so much to be my son" "but the son of some great prince." However, being rich and loving him tenderly, they allowed him free reign in order to avoid displeasing him. When the lady, Pica, heard the neighbors commenting on her son's extravagance, she answered, "What do you think my son will be?" "Through grace, he shall become a son of God." (flute music) In all things, Francis was lavish and he spent much more on his clothes then was warranted by his social position. He would use only the finest materials but sometimes his vanity took an eccentric turn and he would insist on the richest cloth and the commonest being sewn together in the same garment. He was naturally courteous in manner and in speech and the words came spontaneously from his heart. Although a gregarious and worldly youth, he would not answer anyone who addressed him with bad language, this caused his fame to spread throughout the entire province and many who knew him said he would do great things. Grace, working through these natural virtues, brought him to the point of being able to say to himself, "Since you are courteous and generous to men" "from whom you receive vain and transitory favors," "it is only fair that you should be equally" "so to those in need," "since the Lord God, is magnanimous" "in repaying whatever is given to his poor." From that time onward, Francis welcomed the poor and gave them abundant alms. However, one day when he was in the shop, selling cloth. A beggar came in and asked for alms for the love of God. But Francis was so intent on the business of making money that he gave nothing to the poor man. Then, enlightened by divine grace, he began to accuse himself harshly saying, "If that beggar had made his request in the name" "of some great prince, you would surely" "have given him what he asked." "How much more so should you have done it when" "he begged in the name of the King of Kings" "and the Lord of all." "Il mal e vic, de non volguerra!" (marching music) During the year of war between Perugia and Assisi, Francis was captured and taken to a prison in Perugia. Because of his distinguished bearing, he was put among the nobles. "Compagnia de Cavalieri" One day, his companions were especially downhearted. But Francis, who was naturally cheerful, far from appearing sad, seemed almost to be enjoying himself. (man chuckling) ♪ Aitant se plus viu han quam viu iauzens ♪ ♪ A man lives only when he lives joyfully ♪ (man chuckling) One of his fellow prisoners reproached him as a fool for looking happy at being in prison. Francis answered, "Is that what you think of me?" "The day will come when I shall be honored" "by the whole world." After a year, on the conclusion of peace, he with the other prisoners returned to Assisi. A few years later, an Assisian nobleman was planning to stop for Apulia on a military expedition which he hoped would bring him money and honors. Hearing of this, Francis was fired with wish to accompany him and to get knighted by a certain Count Gentile, Gautier de Brienne. He prepared magnificent equipment. And though his fellow citizen was a nobleman, Francis was, by far, the more extravagant of the two. He was absorbed in his plan and keen to set out, when one night, he was visited by the Lord, who seeing him so bent on honor and glory, drew him to Himself by means of a vision. While Francis was asleep, a man appeared to him and called him by name. - ♪ Francesco ♪ - And led him into a vast and pleasant palace, in which the walls were hung with glittering coats of mail, shining buckles and all the weapons and armor of warriors. Francis was delighted and reflecting on what could be the meaning of all this, he asked for whom the splendid arms and beautiful palace were intended. And he received the answer that they were for him and his knights. On awaking, Francis rose gleefully, thinking after the manner of world things, for he'd not yet tasted the spirit of God, that he was destined to become a magnificent prince and that the vision was prophetic of great prosperity. What he had seen spurred him on to start for Apulia and to get himself knighted in the following of Count Gentile. (man chuckling) His glee was such, the people, in surprise, asked the reason for his delight and received the answer, "I know that I shall become a great prince." Now, it happened that after his start for Apulia, Francis felt unwell on arriving at Spoleto and thinking with apprehension about the journey, he went to bed. But half asleep, he heard a voice calling him and asking him whither he was bound. - [Voice] Francesco. Dove Vai? - He replied, telling of his plan. Then he who had previously appeared to him in sleep, spoke these words. - [Voice] Francis, who do you think can best reward you, the master or the servant? - The master. - [Voice] Then why do you leave the master for the servant, the rich lord for the poor man? - Oh, Lord, what do you wish me to do? - [Voice] Return to your own place and you will be told what to do. You must interpret your vision in a different sense. The arms and palace you saw are intended for other knights than those you had in mind and your principality, too will be of another order. - Francis awoke and began to turn this all over in his mind. After the first vision, he had been in a transport of delight, filled with desires for worldly prosperity. But this one left him puzzled and perplexed. He thought about it so intensely, he slept no more that night. Immediately at daybreak, he started back towards Assisi in glad expectation that God, who had shown him the vision would soon reveal his will for the future. (flute music) (man singing in Italian) Soon after Francis had returned to Assisi, his companions elected him king of the revels and gave him a free hand to spend what he liked in the preparation of a sumptuous banquet, as he had often done in other occasions. After the feast, they left the house and started off singing through the streets. (men singing in Italian) Venite, Roberto e Angela. Giaccomo, vieni qui sta sera. I tripudianti (man chuckling) Sono ubriaco un po. (man chuckling) Francis' companions were leading the way and he, holding his wand of office, followed at a little distance. (solemn oboe over singers) Instead of singing, he was listening very tentatively. All of a sudden, the Lord touched his heart, filling it with such surpassing sweetness, that he could neither speak nor move. When his companions looked around, they saw him in the distance and turned back. To their amazement, they saw that he was transformed into another man and they asked him, - "What were you thinking of? - "Why didn't you follow us? - "Francesco, were you thinking of getting married?" - "You are right, I was thinking of wooing the noblest, "richest and most beautiful bride ever seen." (man laughing) His friends laughed at him saying he was a fool and did not know what he was saying. In reality, he had spoken by divine inspiration. The bride was none other than that form of true religion, which he embraced and which above any other is noble, rich and beautiful in its poverty. From that hour, he began to consider himself as not and to despise all those things he had formerly cherished. But he still did so, imperfectly. Not being, as yet, entirely detached from worldly vanities, he gradually withdrew from the tumult of earthly things and applied himself secretly to receive Jesus Christ. At home, he told no one of his secret and turned to God, who alone was his never failing guide. Neither did he ask the advice of anyone except sometimes of the bishop of Assisi. He looked in vain in those around him for that real poverty, which he desired above all earthly things and in which he wanted to live and die. One day, while Francis was praying fervently to God, he received an answer. - [God] Oh, Francis, if you want to know my will, you must hate and despise all that which hitherto, your body has loved and desired to possess. Once you begin to do this, all the things that formerly seemed sweet and pleasant to you will become bitter and unbearable and instead, the things that formerly made you shudder, will bring you great sweetness and content. - Francis was divinely comforted and greatly encouraged by these words. Then one day, as he was riding near Assisi, he met a leper. (man gasping) (wooden leper clapper) He had always had an overpowering horror of these sufferers. But making a great effort, he conquered his aversion, dismounted and in giving the leper a coin, kissed his hand. The leper then gave him the kiss of peace, after which, Francis remounted his horse and rode on his way. Formerly, he could neither touch or even look at lepers. But when he left him on that day, what had been so repugnant to him had really been, truly been turned into something pleasant. Strengthened by God's grace, he was able to obey the command and to love what he had hated and to abhor what he had hitherto, wrongfully loved. In consequence of this, he became such a friend to the lepers, that he lived with them and served them with loving eagerness. His companions noticed how changed he was. And indeed, his heart was already far from them. Even though occasionally, he accepted their company. They tried to probe into his mind. And again, asked him whether he was thinking of marrying and as before, he answered, "I shall bring home a bride more "beautiful, richer, nobler than "any of you have ever seen." (light music) A few days after this, while he was walking near the church of San Damiano, an inner voice bade him go in and pray. He obeyed. And kneeling before an image of the crucified savior, he began to pray most devoutly. ♪ Oh most high ♪ ♪ And glorious God ♪ ♪ Cast your light into the darkness of my heart ♪ ♪ Give me right faith ♪ ♪ And certain hope ♪ ♪ And perfect perfect charity ♪ ♪ Give me true insight Lord ♪ ♪ And wisdom ♪ ♪ That I might always live within ♪ ♪ Your ever holy will ♪ ♪ Give me right faith ♪ ♪ And certain hope ♪ ♪ And perfect perfect charity ♪ (man sobbing) A tender, compassionate voice then spoke to him. - [Voice] Francis, do you not see that my house is falling into ruin? Go and repair it for me. - Trembling and amazed, Francis replied, "Gladly, I will do so, O Lord." He had understood that the Lord was speaking of that very church, which on account of its age, was indeed falling into ruin. These words filled him with the greatest joy and inner light because he knew in spirit that it was indeed, Jesus Christ who had spoken to him. On leaving the church, he found the priest who had charge of it sitting outside and taking a handful of money from his purse, he said, "I beg you, sir, to buy oil and keep" "the lamp before the image of Christ constantly alight." "When this is spent, I will give you as much as you need." Filled with joy at the vision and words of Christ crucified, Francis took various pieces of cloth from his father's shop for sale in the city of Foligno and he sold not only the wares but also his father's horse, which he was riding. Then he returned to the Church of San Damiano, found the poor priest and humbly kissing his hand, told him of what he proposed to do. The priest was astounded at Francis' sudden conversion. And at first he did not believe in it. Thinking Francis to be joking, he refused the proffered money and this was due to the fact that not long before he had seen Francis having a good time with his relatives and friends. Francis insisted more urgently and begged the priest to receive him as a guest for love of God. Finally, the priest consented to his staying on but for fear of Francis' relatives, he would on no account accept the money. Whereupon Francis threw the coins in through the window. So truly had he come to despise all gain. While Francis was staying in the priest's house, his father, Pietro, went around inquiring for news of his son. - [Pietro] Dove mio figlio? - And when he learned what had happened and where Francis was, calling together his neighbors and friends, he hurried off to find him. Now, Francis was still a recent recruit to the service of Christ and when he heard of the threats of his pursuers, foreseeing their arrival, he hid from his father's anger by creeping into a secret cave, which he had prepared as a refuge. There he stayed for a whole month and only one person in his father's house knew of his hiding place. He ate the food brought to him secretly. And prayed continually with many tears, that the Lord would deliver him from such persecution and grant him the fulfillment of his desire. Finally, trusting in Christ, he left the cave, ready to face the insults and blows of his persecutors and lightheartedly, he took the road to Assisi. When his friends and relatives saw him, they covered him with insults, calling him a fool and a madman, "Cucco! Cosi di pazzi!" And hurling stones and mud at him. Seeing him so changed, they thought he must be out of his mind. Finally, the news reached his father and when he heard of Francis' reception at the hands of his fellow citizens, he hurried off to find him, not indeed to set him free but to chastise him, throwing moderation and discretion to the winds, he sprang on the sun like a wolf on a lamb and his face, furious, his eyes glaring. He seized him with many blows and dragged him home. Francis was then shut up in a dark cellar and for many days his father used threats and blows to bend his son's will, to drag him back from the path of good he had chosen and to force him to return to the vanities of the world, money and success. All this strengthened Francis in alacrity to carry through his resolution and he patiently endured the blows and hard words. When his father had to leave home on urgent business, his mother, who disapproved of her husband's action, reasoned gently with her son. - [Mother] Mio carino. - But when she saw that his mind was irrevocably made up and that nothing would move him from his good resolution, she was filled with tender pity and breaking his bonds, she set him free. Giving thanks to almighty God, Francis returned to his former refuge in the secret cave. In the meanwhile, Peter Bernardone returned home. (Peter singing Italian ) (Peter finishing song) And when he saw that his son was gone, he added sin to sin by abusing his wife. (slap) He then went to the Palace of the Commune and denounced Francis to the civil authorities, demanding the restitution of the money of which he had said he had been robbed by his son. "Mio figlio, un ladro!" When the authorities saw how enraged Peter was, they sent a messenger to summon Francis, but he answered that, since by divine grace he had obtained freedom, he was the servant only of God and no longer owed obedience to the civil authorities but was outside their jurisdiction. The city councilors did not wish to force the issue and answered Peter that as Francis had entered the service of almighty God, he was no longer their subject. Peter then realized that no satisfaction was to be had from the civil authorities, so he repeated his accusation before the Bishop of Assisi. The Bishop, a wise and prudent man, sent word to Francis that he must appear and answer his father's indictment and he replied to the messenger, "I will willingly appear before the Lord Bishop," "who is the father and Lord of souls." He therefore went to the Bishop, who received him gladly, saying, "My dear Francis, "your father is highly incensed and greatly" "scandalized by your conduct." "If, therefore, you wish to serve God," "you must first of all, return him his money." "Trust in the Lord, my son and act manfully, fearing" "nothing, for the Lord will help you and provide you" "with all that is necessary in repairing the church." Thereupon, the servant of God rose joyfully, comforted by the Bishop's words. In holding out the money, he said, "My Lord Bishop, not only will I gladly" "give back the money, which is my father's" "but also my clothes." Going into the Bishop's room, he stripped himself of his garments and placing the money on them, he stood naked before the eyes of the Bishop, his father and all present. "Listen, all of you and mark my words." "Hitherto, I have called Peter Bernardone my father" "but because I am resolved to serve God, I return to him" "the money on account of which he was so perturbed" "and also the clothes I wore, which are his." "And from now on, I will say, 'Our Father who art in heaven'" "and not Father Peter Bernardone." His father rose up, burning with grief and anger and he gathered up the garments and money and carried them home. (light music) The Bishop had clearly understood that the servant of God had acted on divine inspiration. And he realized a great mystery lay behind the scene he had witnessed. Therefore, from that hour, he helped and comforted Francis. Loving him with tender charity. (lively music) ♪ I am the troubadour of the Great King ♪ Francis returned to San Damiano, happy and full of fervor, clothed in a hermit's garment and he reassured the priest of the church with the same words that the Bishop had addressed to him, then he started back to the city where he began to praise God loudly in the streets and public places. ♪ Come let us sing to the Lord and shout with joy ♪ ♪ To the rock who saves us ♪ ♪ Let us approach him with praise and thanksgiving ♪ ♪ Sing joyful songs to the Lord ♪ ♪ I am the troubadour of the Great King ♪ When he'd finished his song of praise, he set to begging for stones, with which to restore the church. - "Grazie mille!" - Many people mocked him as a madman but others were moved to tears when they saw how quickly he had passed from worldly pampering and vanity to loving God. He paid no heed to ridicule and gave thanks to God with great fervor of spirit. It would be difficult to specify all the hard work that had to be done to restore the church. At home, Francis had been coddled. Whereas now he carried a load of stones on his shoulders and endured many hardships for loving God. The priest who watched his labor saw how fervently he gave himself to the service of God. Laboring even beyond his strength. And though the priest himself was a poor man, he procured special food for Francis because he knew how delicately he'd been brought up and how in his father's house he'd only eaten what was excellent. Francis himself confessed he would not touch anything he did not like. - "C'est Bon!" - One day, however, when he noticed that the priest was providing him with special food, he reflected, (man sniffing) "Wherever you may happen to go, do you suppose you will find" "another such priest who would treat you so kindly?" "This is not the life of the poor" "such as you wish to choose." "Rather you should go bowl in hand from door to door." So one day with great fervor of spirit, he took a bowl and went through the streets, begging for alms from door to door, just as he had described the begging of the poor. People dropped a variety of scraps into the bowl and knowing what his former life had been, many were exceedingly astonished. When it came to eating the contents of the bowl, Francis' stomach turned, for he had never seen such a mess, let alone try to eat it, at last, making a great effort, he started to gulp it down. And it seemed to him the most delicious food in the world. He praised and thanked God who had changed what was bitter into sweetness. And he also asked the priest, from then on would not procure or prepare any more food for him. In the meanwhile, Francis was working steadily at restoring the church and he called out loudly and joyfully to the passersby in French. A language he delighted to speak, though he did not know it very well, "Venez et nousaider faire ce travail" "pour l'eglise de Saint Damien!" Come and help us do this work for the Church of San Damiano. (light music) Until the work of restoring the church was completed, Francis still wore the garments of a hermit with a strap to serve as a belt and he carried his staff and had sandals on his feet. Then one day, during the celebration of mass, he heard the words in which Christ bade his disciples, "Go out and preach, carrying neither gold, nor silver," "nor have a sack for the journey without" "staff, bread or shoes and carrying no second garment." After listening to the priest's explanation of these words of the gospel, full of unspeakable joy, Francis exclaimed. (light music) "This is what I wish." "This is what I seek." "That is what I long to do with all my heart." He learned these gospel words by heart, meditating on what he had heard. And joyfully, he started to put them into practice. He discarded his second garment and from that time onward, he used no staff, shoes or haversack. He kept one miserable tunic and instead of a strap, took a length of cord as a belt. He set his whole heart and mind, how he could best carry out the words of grace he had heard. And divinely inspired, he began to speak in public. (light music) Very simply of penitence and the life of evangelical perfection. By his own preaching and solitary councils, he was able to unite in peace, many who had formally hated each other and were living in sin. ♪ The Lord give you peace ♪ ♪ The Lord give you peace ♪ ♪ Pax et bonum ♪ ♪ Peace and good ♪ ♪ Pace e bene ♪ ♪ Peace and good ♪ ♪ The Lord give you peace ♪ ♪ The Lord give you peace ♪ The truth of his teaching was brought home to people by the simplicity of his way of life. In two years after his own conversion, several men were drawn to follow his example of penitence and they left everything in order to join him. The first of these was Brother Bernard of holy memory. He will knew how luxuriously Francis had lived in the world. Therefore, when he saw how he labored to restore ruined churches and what a harsh life he led, Bernard, too, resolved to sell his possessions and give all to the poor. With this in mind, he went one day, secretly, to see God's servant and opened his heart to him. Also inviting him to come that evening and lodge in his house. Francis joyfully gave thanks to God because so far he had no companions and Master Bernard was a virtuous and godly man. Therefore, it was arranged. They went to Bernard's house and remained there all night in great joy of heart. Bernard put a question to him. - "Francis, "if a man receives from God, few or many possessions" "and having enjoyed them for a number of years," "now, no longer wishes to retain them," "what would be the best thing for him to do?" Francis answered, - "In that case, Bernard, it were better for the man "to give back to God what he had received." - So Master Bernard, who was very rich, sold all his possessions and distributed a great deal of money to the poor of the city and with another man named, Peter, who also wished to join them, followed our Lord's counsel. Not many days later, a man of Assisi named Giles came to them and kneeling down with great reverence and devotion, he begged the servant of God to receive him as a companion. Seeing him so faithful and devout, Francis admitted him most willingly. "My dear brother, Giles, Brother Bernard and Peter, "you have embraced this life and given everything" "you have to the poor, we are satisfied" "now with one habit which has patched inside and outside" "and a cord and trousers, we refuse to have anything more." "Oh, brothers, this is our life and rule" "and the life and rule of all those" "who may wish to join us." When the people heard them preach, they said, "Who are these men and why do they speak like this?" They made this comment because at that time the fear and love of God had died out in the country. And no one spoke of penance, which indeed was considered as folly. This attitude was caused by the temptations of the flesh, the cupidity of the world and the pride of life. The whole of mankind seemed engulfed in these three evil forces. Blessed Francis called the brothers in the woods surrounding the church of St. Mary of the Angels, where they often gathered to pray. "My brothers, do not be afraid to preach penance. "Put your trust in God who overcame the world. "Hope steadfastly in him who by the Holy Spirit "speaks through you to exhort all to be converted to him "and to observe his commandments. "You will find some men to be faithful and kind" "and they will receive you gladly" "but you will also find many who are unfaithful," "proud and blasphemous and they will insult" "and injure you and your words." "Therefore, prepare your hearts" "to suffer everything humbly and patiently." When the brothers heard these words they began to become afraid, but the saint said to them, "My brothers, do not fear, Christ is with us." After these words, the saint blessed them. And thus, fortified, those godly men started out on their way, faithfully following Francis' directions. ♪ We adore you Lord Jesus Christ ♪ Whenever they came on a wayside church or cross, they bowed in prayer. ♪ Churches of the world ♪ ♪ Because by your holy cross ♪ ♪ You have redeemed the world ♪ ♪ Redeemed the world ♪ ♪ We adore you we adore you ♪ ♪ Lord Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Christ ♪ ♪ And we bless you and we bless you ♪ ♪ For the churches of the world ♪ ♪ Because by your holy cross ♪ ♪ You have redeemed the world ♪ ♪ Redeemed redeemed the world ♪ People now saw how the brothers rejoiced in the midst of trials and tribulation, how zealous they were in prayer and how they did not accept money like other people, nor keep it when it was given them. And how they really loved one another. Seeing this, many people became convinced that the brothers were true disciples of Jesus Christ and with remorse in their hearts, they came to ask the brothers pardon for having previously insulted and injured them. The brothers forgave them gladly saying, "The Lord forgive you." When they were all together, joy filled their hearts and they no longer remembered past injuries. They have a constant in prayer and working with their hands and each deeply loved and cared for the other as a mother cares for a cherished only child. Charity burned so ardently in their hearts, that it was easy to risk life itself, not only for love of Jesus Christ but also for the soul and body of any one of the brothers. Because the brothers lived in true poverty, they were correspondingly generous and open handed with everything given them for love of God, for love of him, they gladly gave to all who asked something of them, especially, they handed onto the poor, any alms they received, as Christ said, "Give to whoever may ask."

"Let us, therefore, go to our holy mother, the Roman Church" "and lay before the supreme pontiff, what Our Lord" "has begun to work through us." "So that with his consent and direction, we may continue" "what we have undertaken." When they arrived in Rome... (dramatic organ music) They found there the Cardinal of Supina, known as the Lord John of St. Paul, who welcomed them most gladly. Finally he asked Francis the reason for their coming to Rome And when he learned what was on their minds, he offered to plead their cause at the Papal Court. He then went to the Curia and spoke to Pope Innocent III. "Holy Father," "I have found a most excellent man who desires" "to live according to the form of the Gospel" "and in everything to observe evangelical perfection." "I am convinced that through this man, Our Lord wills" "to renew the faith of Holy Church in the whole world." The Pope was very astonished at these words and bade the Cardinal bring blessed Francis to him. The following day, the Cardinal presented the servant of God to the Pontiff, to whom he opened his heart, disclosing all his holy intention. "Your Holiness," "The rule and life of the friars is to live in obedience, "chastity and without anything of our own. "Following the teachings and footsteps "of Our Lord Jesus Christ, who says, "'If thou will be perfect, go sell what thou hast "'and give to the poor "'and thou shalt have treasure in heaven;' "and 'If anyone wishes to come after me," "'let him deny himself, take up his cross and follow me.'" "And elsewhere, Christ says," "'If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father" "'and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters," "'yes, even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.'" "My Lord, this is our life and our rule." Being gifted with great wisdom and discretion, the Pope approved blessed Francis' desire. And exalted him and the brothers at length and blessed them. "My sons, your plan of life seems too hard and rough." "Francis, go and pray to God that he may reveal whether" "what you ask proceeds, indeed, from his most holy will." "And this in order that we will be assured that in granting" "your desire, we will be following the Will of God." While the saint was praying according to the bidding of the Lord Pope, God spoke to him in spirit by means of a parable. Blessed Francis then presented himself again to the Pontiff and said, "My Lord and Master, (flute music) "A poor and beautiful maiden lived in the desert. "And a king, seeing her beauty, took her as his bride "since he was sure she would bear him splendid sons. "The marriage contract was drawn up "and the marriage consummated and many sons were born. "When they grew up, their mother said to them, "'My children do not be fearful, for your father is a king. "'Go therefore, to his court and he will "'give you all you need.' "When the king saw these children, "he marveled at their beauty. "In recognizing their likeness to himself, he said, "'Whose sons are you?'" "And they answered that they were the children" "of the poor woman who lived in the desert." "Upon which, the king embraced them joyfully, saying," "'Fear nothing, for you are my children" "'and shall be provided for here in my court.'" "My Lord, I am that poor woman in the desert." "And these are my children." On hearing this, the Pope was greatly amazed. Also because before Francis appeared, he had had a vision that the church of St. John Lateran, the Mother Church of Christendom was only saved from falling by being upheld on the shoulder of a small insignificant man. When the Pope looked at Francis, he began to say to himself, "This surely is a holy and religious man" "by whom the Church of God shall be supported and upheld." Then he embraced Francis and approved the rule he had given him, and gave him permission to preach penance to all. Having obtained these favors, blessed Francis thanked God and kneeling on the ground, promised obedience and reverence to the Lord Pope. (light music) From that time onward, Francis wandered through cities, villages and hamlets and he began to preach with increasing perfection. What he preached he had already put into practice himself and his teaching of the truth was full of assurance. The power and truth of what he said did not come from any human source and it seemed as though he were a being from another century. Many of the people, nobles and commoners alike, were touched by divine inspiration and they began to imitate Francis' way of life and to follow in his steps. They abandoned the cares and pomps of the world, desiring to live under his direction, guidance and discipline and with them, the little brothers continued to speak the peace of Jesus Christ. ♪ The Lord give you peace the Lord give you peace ♪ ♪ The Lord give you peace the Lord give you peace ♪ ♪ Pax et bonum ♪ ♪ Peace and good ♪ ♪ Pace e bene ♪ ♪ Peace and good ♪ ♪ The Lord give you peace the Lord give you peace ♪ ♪ The Lord give you peace ♪ After this, Francis decided that twice in the year at Pentecost and at the feast of Saint Michael the Archangel in September, the brothers should gather at the church of St. Mary of the Angels and hold a chapter. "My dear friars minor," "lesser brothers without distinction," "please never judge or criticize those who live in luxury" "or indulge in superfluous and splendid clothes." "God is their Lord and ours." "We should reverence them as our brothers and sisters" "because they are the children of the same Creator." "Since you speak of peace, all the more "must you have it in your hearts." "Let none be provoked to anger or scandal by you" "but rather may they be drawn to peace" "and goodwill through your gentleness." "We have been called to heal wounds," "to unite what has fallen apart and to bring home" "those who have lost their way." When all present had received his blessing, they started out on their way through the world as pilgrims and strangers. (dramatic music) - It was the Lord's will that the entire world should know of the love of blessed Francis and how his heart was filled with the thought of Christ's passion. Therefore, while he was still alive, God conferred on him the wonderful prerogative of a most singular privilege. Wrapped in divine contemplation, blessed Francis was absorbed in seraphic love and desire and through the tenderness of his compassion, he was transformed into a living crucifix. Thus, the inmost desire of his burning love was fulfilled. One morning, two years before his death, about the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, while he was praying on the side of a mountain named La Verna, there appeared to him a seraph in the beautiful figure of a crucified man. Having his hands and feet extended as though on a cross and clearly showing the face of Jesus Christ. Two wings met above his head, two covered the rest of his body to his feet and two were spread as in flight. - When the vision had passed, the soul of Francis was afire with love and on his body, there appeared the wonderful impression of the wounds of Christ, the stigmata. Blessed Francis did all in his power to hide these wounds, not wishing God's gift to be seen by men. But he could not hide this gift entirely and it became known to his intimate companions. Meanwhile, as his infirmities increased and all his bodily strength failed and destitute of all his powers, he could not move himself at all. Now, when he saw that his last day was at hand, blessed Francis called the brothers he wanted and said, "May you find every blessing you desire." "May whatever you ask, worthily, be granted to you." "Farewell, you, my sons." "In the fear of the Lord," "may you remain in Him always." "Happy will they be who will persevere" "in the things they have begun." "I am hastening to the Lord" "and I am confident that I will see my God," "whom I serve devoutly in my spirit." "I have done what was mine to do." "May Christ teach you yours." Then he called two of his brothers and spiritual sons and commanded them to sing in a loud voice with joy of spirit, the praises of the Lord over his approaching death or rather over the life that was so near. ♪ Altissimu ♪ ♪ Omnipotente ♪ ♪ Bonsignore ♪ ♪ Tue sono le laude ♪ ♪ La Gloria el honore ♪ ♪ Et omne benedictione ♪ (light music) ♪ Altissimo ♪ ♪ Ad te solo ♪ ♪ Se knofano ♪ ♪ Et nulla homo enne dignu ♪ ♪ Te mentovare ♪ ♪ Laudato sie ♪ ♪ Misignore ♪ ♪ Cum tucte le tue ♪ ♪ Creature ♪ ♪ Spetialmente messor ♪ ♪ Lo frate sole ♪ While they were standing reverently at his side, waiting his blessed death and happy end, his most holy soul was freed from his body and received into the abyss of light. And his body fell asleep in the Lord. One of the brothers and disciples, a man of some renown, whose name I think I should withhold here because while he lives in the flesh, he prefers not to glory in so great a privilege, saw the soul of our most holy father ascend over many waters directly to heaven. For, it was like a star having, in some ways, the immensity of the moon but to a certain extent, the brightness of the sun. And it was borne upward on a little white cloud. ♪ Altissimu... ♪ It is a certain fact that our holy father, St. Francis is alive in a life of glory. May we be brought to that same life of glory through his merits, where he lives for all eternity.
