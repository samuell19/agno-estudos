Keep your hands where I can see them. Nobody move! - That's it? Nah! Nah! There's gotta be more than that! - Hey, th--th--there's more in the safe. : 911, what's your emergency? - Yeah, there's a man with a gun holding up a corner store. - I mean it! I'll kill him if you move! Hurry up! - It's over, man. Just put down the gun. - Aaah! What are you doing? No! Wait, I didn't-- Please! - Per capita, the United States imprisons more people than any other nation on Earth, 2.5 times that of England, France and Germany combined. Is it because we have more crime here? No, it's because we incarcerate more people for more reasons, drug possession topping the list. We also keep them in prison longer. And the sad truth is, the longer someone stays in prison, the less chance he or she has of being rehabilitated, which is why we also have the highest percentage of re-offenders in the world. So, as you contemplate careers that will put you in direct contact with criminals, you might want to bear in mind that the time they spent in prison could've actually been the reason they became true criminals. Hannah. Would you mind taking over? - Of course. Is everything OK? - Yeah. I apologize. I can't stay. Miss Marshall will take it from here. Please read the next chapter and be prepared to discuss it next time. Thank you. - So, um, incarceration rates and their effect on recidivism. If you'll look at the table on page 73. - Go, go, go! - What's going on? What do we got? - One gunman as far as we can tell. Guy witness who called it in said the owner's in there with some customers. We don't know how many. - We IDed the gunman? - Not yet. : Please! - Hello? Darcy, break room now. - OK. - Yeah? Tanya just called me to the break room? - Yeah, I know. Me too. : I'm speaking to you from downtown, where we are... - It's your sister! ...the situation is evolving at a convenience store. Information is sketchy at the time, but what we can confirm is that there is a gunman holding several customers and the owner hostage inside the store. In this evolving crisis, the Detroit Police Department has called in Cameron Grainger a PhD in criminal psychology, to act as its negotiator. The gunman appears to be acting alone and as of yet... - Hey, she'll be fine. She's been through it a million times. - Aaah! Aaah! - Don't move. - My name is Cameron Grainger. I'm standing right outside. We'd like to resolve this situation so no one gets hurt. So whatever you want or need, I'm sure we can get that for you. But we need to know what that is. So, you're gonna have to talk to me. I know you don't know me. But you can trust me. I don't want anyone to get hurt here. That includes you. You're gonna have to take the first step, or I can't help you. - Hello? - Hi. Thank you. That showed a lot of strength. Are you OK? - Yeah. - What's your name? - My name's not important. - OK. No problem. Are you the only one in there with a gun or are there others? - No, just me. - Is anybody hurt? Does anyone need medical attention? - Look, you said you could help me. - I can. Tell me what it is you want. - Uh, I--I don't know. - Well, do you know why you went in there, why you're holding all those people against their will? - I didn't plan that. I need money. - So, are you saying you went into this store to rob it? - Yeah, and then the cops showed up before I could get away. - So you don't know anybody in there? - No. - You didn't go in there to hurt someone? - No. I don't want to hurt anybody. - Great, then you and I are on the same page. So, what can we do to resolve this? - I don't know. - He's just a kid. - I'm in a lot of trouble here. - Not necessarily. No one's been hurt. All the money's still there. If you cooperate now, we can work something out. - Why should I trust you? - Because I am going to trust you. To keep your end of the bargain. - What do you want me to do? I want you to put down the gun and come out the store with your hands behind your head. - There's a lot of cops out there. They're gonna shoot me. - They won't. I promise you. - And why should I trust you? - Can you see out the window? You see the police cars? - Yeah. I see them. - OK, I'm gonna stand up. - Cameron! Hold your fire. Repeat, hold your fire! - Copy that. - Can you see me? - Yeah. I can see you. - OK. - Something is happening. The negotiator is standing up. It appears she is communicating with the assailant on her cell. - I'm gonna set down the phone a minute and take off my vest. - What's she doing? - She's walking toward to store, removing her bulletproof vest. - Don't worry, she knows what she's doing. - ...meant to be a sign of trust. - I'm not carrying a weapon. Can you see that? - Yeah. - OK, I'm gonna come closer. I'll be right outside the door. No one's gonna shoot you when you come out, because they'd shoot me too. OK? - OK. - All right. - She continues to approach the entrance of the store still on the phone, no doubt with the suspect. - We can put an end to this right now and no one will get hurt. Do you want that? - Yes. - OK. So put down the gun, and come out slowly, with your hands behind your head. I'll be waiting right here. - OK. I'm gonna hang up now. - OK, good. Me, too. - Hello? - I'm still here. Erik, my name's Erik. - Thank you, Erik. Now, let's put an end to this. - I'm sorry. I never wanted to hurt you. - Something is definitely happening now. It looks as though the assailant may be coming out of the store. - Leave it be. It's almost over. - Hey! -: Gun! - No! - Oh my god! The police just fired! - Cease fire, cease fire! Freeze! Hands in the air! Drop the gun! - On the ground! - No! - Medic! - Hang in, Erik. No! - Medic! - No! - The suspect is not moving. Police have yet to confirm what has happened, but what we do know at this point is that shots were fired after the suspect emerged from the store... : Come on, folks, let's back it up. - The man shot and killed by Detroit police today outside a Corktown convenience store has been identified as Erik Sanders, A 16-year-old runaway who sources say had been living on the streets of the Corktown district since early May. Police also confirmed there were no bullets in the gun Sanders used in his aborted attempt to rob the store and and subsequent hostage crisis. - Gun! - Cease fire, cease fire! - Dr. Cameron Grainger, the negotiator enlisted by the DPD refused to comment on the shooting and whether it was accidental or intentional. - Let me guess. You just happened to be in the neighbourhood and decided to drop in. - Well, I was gonna grab a coffee at the Starbucks around the corner but then I remembered how good your coffee is. Plus, it's free. : Hey. Hi. Come in. - Got your e-mail. Thanks. You know, when I was a kid, we used to visit my grandpa's farm upstate. He had horses, and I must have been 6 or 7 and-- - Really, Liam? The "I fell off my horse and got right back in the saddle" story? - It was a pony, actually. Look, Cameron, you've handled a lot of negotiations, sooner or later one was gonna go south on us. - He was a kid. He trusted me. - It wasn't your fault. - I should've gone into the store and walked him out. - That's against protocol. - I rushed it. I got through to him too quickly. I thought it was gonna be easy. I didn't listen. If I had, I would've realized how scared he was. - All right, look. If you're convinced you did something wrong, nothing I say is gonna change your mind. But you should still get back in the saddle. - I need to take some time off, Liam. - How much time? - I don't know. - OK. So when can I take you out to dinner then? - You're asking me out? - You gotta eat. And since we won't be working together anymore, technically, there's no conflict of interest. I care about you, Cameron. - Let me think about it. To be honest, I'm just not... - Feeling like you'd made the greatest date right now. - Yeah. - Well, when you do, you know where to find me. Well, thanks for the coffee. - Of course. - Bye. - Bye. - Have you heard from the boy's mother? - No. I shouldn't have really expected to. - I'm sure it meant a lot to her that you reached her out. - I had to. - Bad stuff happens, Cameron. We just have to figure out a way to work through it and carry on. - So you think I should get back in the saddle too? - If by "back in the saddle" you mean back on the force, you're out of your mind. I worry about you every second. - Well, I like to think that I've helped a lot of people. You can help a lot of people by teaching your students to be negotiators. - So how are things with Adam? - Surprisingly great. I know. The experts say you shouldn't date people you work with, but it's working for us so far. - That's good to hear. - What? What's that look? - What look? - You're dating someone! Is it someone at school! - No, not dating. It's not at school. Liam McNeil. He is a police officer. - I know who he is. - He asked me on a date. - And? - And... I said maybe. - Maybe? "Maybe" is a step in the right direction. - You think I should date a cop? - Not particularly. But I think you should date someone. Knowing how picky you are, if he got as far as a "maybe," he's gotta be worth it. Look, I gotta go, but you're so keeping me posted on this. - Oh, sure, ma'am. - Hi. - Hi! - Some of the students are wondering when you'll be back. - I'm not sure exactly. To be honest, at the moment, I can't stand the thought of hearing myself pontificate. - You don't pontificate. - How are you making out? - Well, I was nervous at first, everybody watching me, hanging on my every word. But I'm used to it now, and I really enjoy it. - Of course you do. You're a natural teacher. That is why I picked you to be my T.A. - But I'm nowhere near as good as you are. - You are too kind. - Which is why we all miss you and hope you'll come back soon. - Thank you, Hannah. I appreciate that. It came in the mail this morning. "Dear, Dr. Grainger. Thank you for your letter "and forgive me for not answering sooner. "Losing Erik has been hard. "He was a good boy at heart. "You say you feel bad about what happened. "Please don't. "I understand, better than anybody, "how, even when you try your best... "things sometimes go wrong. "Thank you for your kind words. They meant a lot to me. "Sincerely, Mary Sanders." - You must feel relieved. - I do. I guess. It's good to know that she doesn't blame me, but still... - It'll come. You just gotta give it more time. - Yeah, maybe you're right. - You'll see. Some day, this is all just gonna be a distant memory. - Speaking of which... do you remember this? Oh my god! Of course I do! - I was just clearing out my office and there it was. I was actually thinking how little it changed. - Have you heard from Liam? - No, but I was thinking about calling him. - Well, whatever you do, don't show him this! - Because it worked out. - Yeah, I know. It's good we're done with that. Ah! OK... - Hey! You free for lunch today? - I could be. - There is a new Italian on Windward that is supposed to be great, next to that shoe shop we like. - Designer pasta and shoes? I'll check my schedule and call you later. - Sounds like a plan. - You sure about this? - Absolutely. It's a piece of cake. - Yeah, I just don't wanna walk into something we can't handle. - If you're worried about this, I'll do it alone. - I'm good. - Dr. Grainger! - You guys made it as far as Chapter 7? Seems to me like I should take time off more often. - Oh, come on! - Good morning, Mrs. Crane. - Tanya. - What can we do for you? - My daughter's authorized to write checks on my account, and I want her name removed. - Is she meeting you here? - Why would she? - Do you have a letter from her agreeing to her removal from the account? - Of course not. - I'm sorry. Without your daughter's written permission, we can't alter the account. - Why not? It's my account. - Well, if you're both signatories, then it's consider a joint account. - This is ridiculous. I'm her mother. I can remove her name if I want to. - Unfortunately, legally, you can't. - Let me talk to the manager. - If I were you, I wouldn't. All right, listen up! We are robbing this bank! So if you don't wanna die, shut up and do exactly as we say! Get on the ground over there, now! You get on the ground. Go! Get on the ground. On the ground! - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't be a hero for somebody else's money. Thank you. You? - Yeah? - Get over there. To the couches. Go! Now. Hey, hey, hey! Faster! Go, go, go, go, go! Sit down! Go sit down! Hey! Get away from the door. Get away from the door! All right, everybody behind the counter move in on the floor here. Now! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not you two. Get over here. Move! Come on! Move, move, move... - Take the cash from the drawer and put into that. Do it now. - Get on the floor. Get on the floor! Faster, faster! Don't move! Do not move! Hey, Grandma. I don't know if you heard, but when I said everyone on the floor, I meant everyone on the floor. - I heard you, but you can't possibly think that I'm going-- - Yeah, actually I do, come on. Get down there! All units, 2-11 in progress. Possible hostage at the Detroit Mutual. All units handle code 3. - 27-22 responding. - This is outrageous. You won't get away with this! - Yeah, OK. - It'll be all right. Do what they say. - All right, let's go! Pick it up! Faster, faster! - Stay on the ground. Stay on the ground! What are you looking at? Stay on the ground! - Hey, thanks again for filling in for me. - Anytime. - Please leave a message. - Hey! I am just checking to see if we are still on for lunch. Call me. - Zip up the bag, sweetheart. All right, over here with the others. Let's go. Move, move, move! Against the wall. We're good to go. - We're taking her with us. - What? - Insurance. Hey, come here. Look at this. - What? What do we do now? - We stick to the plan. Come here. Come on, come on. - Hey, bastard! - Shut up! - Hey! Leave her here! - Hey! You've got something to say? - Go! - Nobody moves! - Keep going. - Stay here. - What are you doing? - Incoming! - What was that? - Some gunshots. I'm going. - Hey, hey! Get back! Get back! Sit down! Hey, get away from the door! Get away from the door! Lie down. - What the hell were you thinking? - Everyone down! Let's go, let's go! Sit down! - What are we going to do now? - Shut up and sit down! - You got a Plan B? - Hi, you've reached Darcy. Please leave a message. - Fine! I will eat lunch and buy fabulous shoes all by myself then. - Get back. - You're gonna have to go this way. - All right, everyone in and find a seat. Let's go! Come on, move! - There aren't enough chairs. - Here, here. - Ah, that's nice, the Boy Scout! Come on, everyone in! Let's go! - All right, everybody take out your cell phones. Put them in here. - It's upstairs. - So is mine. - Come on. Come on. Come on, come on! - Hey, you too. - I don't have a cell phone. I'm diabetic. I was gonna go to the pharmacy after here for a refill. I need my medication every 4 hours. Without it, I could go into seizure. I could die! - Why don't I put you out of your misery right now? - Leave her alone! - We got a real live one here. - Is that all of them? You better not be lying to me. - I want everybody pushed back within 50 yards. What's our status? Do we know how many gunmen there are? - Caller confirmed 2, both male. - How many are the people in the bank? - Eight employees and a few customers. Caller wasn't sure. - No shots fired? - The back alley when they tried to escape. - Any of our guys return fire? - No. - Good. Got innocent people in there. They tried to escape how? - There's a truck parked in the back alley. We're checking it out. So what now? - We've got hostages. We need a negotiator. - What the hell are we gonna do now? - They're not gonna come charging in here, not with hostages. They'll have to negotiate. - Yeah, we know how that finishes. We get screwed. - I don't think so. - What are you doing? Who are you calling? - About time you called. I was just about to-- Who is this? Yes, this is Cameron Grainger. - You're on northeast tower. : Ten-four. - Got it. The truck's hot. It was reported stolen from upstate a week ago. - Have forensics gone through it yet? - Yeah. So far nothing. No images, no prints, nothing. They must have wiped it clean. - What about our guys that were shot at? Were they able to give a description to help with an ID? All they came up with is 2 white males, medium height and build, both with goatees dressed in coveralls. We have any open cases with matching descriptions or M.O.'s? - No, so far, nothing. I'm hitting walls everywhere I turn. - Keep at it. For now, we'll go with what we've got. Follow up with the van, check with local police upstate, see if they have anything on their end. - Will do. Have they made any contact yet? - Not a word. We've redirected all the lines out of the bank. Anyone makes a call in there, it'll get routed through here. - Hey. What are you doing here? I didn't request you for this. - No. The guys in the bank did. - This is absurd. How long do they intend to keep us here? Oh! - It's your phone. - Are you outside? - I just got here. - Wow, that was fast, Cameron. Did you break a few traffic laws on the way? - Oh, maybe one or two. Hey, you've got me at a disadvantage. You know my name, but I don't know yours. - Well, that's right. - We know that you have one colleague in there. - Ha! Colleague? - Is there more than one? - And why would I tell you that? - OK. I get it. You don't want to give me what I want. So why don't you tell me what you want? - Wow! You know, you're really good at this. - How do you mean? - It's like one of them role- playing video games, right? You approach from one angle, your opponent dodges, then you come at them from another angle. - Except this isn't a game. There are real people involved, and we don't want anyone to get hurt. - Except real people do get hurt, Cameron. Don't they? All the time. - Not if we work together. - "Work together," "Colleagues"... You make it sound like a board meeting. - There must be something that you want. - Well, by golly, there must be! I'll tell you what. When I figure out what it is, I'll give you a call. - He hung up. - Talk to me, Cameron. Why'd this guy call you? How does he have your number? - He's on my sister's phone. - Your sister? What's she got to do with this? - She's in the bank. She's one of the hostages. - Oh, no. - Mr. Winston, the bank-security tech, is here. - Mr. Winston, thank you for coming. We'll set up right here. - Why'd you hang up? - 'Cause it's better to make them sweat a little. - How did you know to call that woman? How did you know her sister was the bank manager? - In the paper. Their names were in the paper. - Hey! Don't lie to me. - We're partners, buddy. I would never do that. - Mrs. Crane, are you all right? - Ah... - Whoa! - I've almost got it. - Got what? - The live video feed from all the cameras inside. There several cameras in the lobby. - Well, they've moved everyone out of the there. - Where is everybody? - I don't know. Let me try another one. They've got the guns, so we know who they are. - Where is everybody else? - Look, I don't see the point here. We should negotiate our way out now. We've got the leverage. - We'll have more if we make them wait. - Wait for what? : Hey! We need some help down here. - Where are they going? - The break room. - Well, they must be holding the hostages in there. - You have any cameras in there? - No, but there is something you might be interested to know about that room. - Hey! Get away from her. - She fainted. - She warned us about this. - Get away from her! - She feels feverish. I think we should try to cool her down. : Yeah. - You heard what that old lady said. She could die! - I thought you didn't believe her. - If someone dies in there, they're gonna blame us and I wanna get out of here! - We will get out of here when I am damn well good and ready. Now shut up. - All right. But we should do something about that old woman. - Fine. - An old aqueduct runs underneath the bank. It's no longer in use. Old building code from, like, a 100 years ago forced them to build an access to it. - You mean you can get into the aqueduct from the bank? - In and out. There's a locked access cover in the break room. - Is this something those guys would know about? - I doubt it. - Do the people who work in the bank know about it? - Some of the managers carry keys to it. As far as I know, no one's ever had to open it. - Hey! - We told you to get away from her! Get over there. - You're asking for trouble. - Hey, leave her alone. You, come with us. - What do you want with her? - If there's a way in or out of that bank, I have a responsibility to cover it. - Send officers in there, the gunmen could hear them. It's too risky! - Everything about this is risky. - It's him. Hello? - There's something I want. - OK, good. What is it? - I need 2 E.M.T.s to come in here with a gurney and collect an elderly lady who's having health issues. - What kind of health issues? - Does it matter? You have live feeds from the security cameras? - Yes. - Switch to the lobby one. - Bring up the lobby cameras. - Got it. - How does it feel, Cameron... Seeing your little sister a trigger-pull away from death? - Not good. - Well, when the E.M.T.s get here, you give me a call. I'll be watching the door. If I see any sign of police or if the E.M.T.s come in armed, my buddy over here, he's gonna shoot your little sister in the head. You understand me? - Yes. - Good. - There's something else going on here. This isn't about robbing a bank. This is personal. - I'm gonna go check on the old lady. - Sit down. Hey! Sit down. Let me ask you something, Darcy. You and your sister, were you guys close? - She's my best friend. - Would you die for her? - Yes, I would. You targeted me, didn't you? Because of Cameron. - Stay here. - If this isn't a bank job, then what is it? - I don't know. - You said it was personal. Personal, how? Did you have these guys arrested? Is this about revenge? - I don't know. - The E.M.T.s are on their way. - Good. It's a pressure situation, I hope they're good under fire. - We'll make sure to brief them before they go in. - Call Water & Sewage. I want access to that aqueduct. Tell S.W.A.T. to get a team ready. I'm sending them in. - I think we're making a mistake. - Don't OK? I'll leave the negotiating to you but when it comes to tactical decisions, you're gonna have to follow my lead. - Do we know anything about these guys? - Not much. Obviously, they're pros. They knew about the cameras, didn't leave any prints in the truck. - The truck? - In the alley behind the bank. - Was it registered? - Yeah, to the guy they stole it from. - Local? - No, somewhere upstate. - Where? - Lake County. - Lake County. Erik Sanders was from Lake County. I need a phone. I need to keep my cell line open. Thank you. Hannah? This is Dr. Grainger. I need your help. - Hey, back down there. Now! Let's go. Is it possible for someone else to see the footage from the bank's cameras on their computer? - Yeah, sure, if I give them access to our web site. - All right, see what you can see, but don't try to be heroes. Just do whatever they tell you to do. - OK. - We're good to go. : The E.M.T.s are ready to come in. - Cameron, your sister wants to say hello. - It's OK, Cameron. I'm fine! - Just remember, if you mess with us... ...she is a dead woman. Watch her. Send them in. The doors are unlocked. - They're heading in. Jackson, get me a status report on the S.W.A.T. team. Find out if they're in the tunnel yet. - I'm on it. Control to Bravo... - You realize we're sending in potential hostages. - It's the right decision, Liam. - She's over there. - Stop! What's in your pocket? - My walkie. - What's in your pocket? - My walkie. - Hands on your head, both of you! Get the woman and get out of here. - Bravo one to control. We're at the door. We're entering the tunnel. Copy that, Bravo one. : OK... - They're coming out. - All units stand down. We have "friendlies" exiting the building. I repeat, stand down. Can you tell what's wrong with her? - Not until we get her on monitors. - There's nothing wrong with me, now I'm out of that hell-hole. - Debrief her. - I beg your pardon? - We need a Lake County police officer to go to this address. - Whose is it? - Mary Sanders, Erik's mother. - Cameron, we don't even know for sure-- - I trusted you on the aqueduct. You need to trust me on this. - Stay here. - So, what now? - Now, we wait until it gets dark. It'll be easier to get away. OK, get away how? - Same way we got in, the van. - Yeah, and as soon as we get in, they're gonna blow it to smithereens. - No, see, I don't think so. We're not gonna be alone. - Oh right. The, uh, the girl. Darcy, our, uh... What you call her? Insurance? - Are you OK? - Yeah. I'm just rattled. - Listen... They took my cell, but I still have my keys. Under that mat, there's an access panel. We could open it. - Mary Sanders? - Yes. - Mrs. Sanders? - This is Mary Sanders. - Mrs. Sanders, this is Cameron Grainger. Thank you for speaking with us. The officer brought you up to speed with everything that's happening here? - She did. - Are you at a computer? - Yes. - Do you mind to go ahead and press play? Do you recognize those men? - No. - Hold on a second, guys. These images have been looking weird to me all day. - Hold on a second please, Mrs. Sanders. - What do you got, Jackson? - Let me try something. Yo, check this out. I knew it. Those aren't their real faces. They're wearing masks. - You're kidding me. At least now we know why she doesn't recognize them. - Ms. Sanders. I'd like to place a call to one of the men in the bank. Could you just listen in and not say anything? I don't want him to know that you're on the phone. - I can do that. - You're muting her signal into us, too? - In case we can't trust her. - I told you. You don't call me. I call you. - I was just checking in to see if there's anything that you need. - If I need anything, I'll let you know. Don't call here again. - Mrs. Sanders, did you recognize that voice? Mrs. Sanders? Mrs. Sanders? Are you still there? : Yeah. I know that voice. It's Scott. - Who is Scott? - My son, Erik's older brother. - This is it. Take position. I'll check it out. Bravo one to control, we have visual on the entrance. - Copy that, Bravo one. - Everybody stand by. - It leads to an abandoned aqueduct. We need to get it open in case we need a fast way out of here. - It's too dangerous. - It'll take a minute. - What if we get caught? Are you willing to risk your life? - Yeah, I am. - What about them, what about their lives? We don't have the right to-- - I need to do something. These people are our responsibility. - You're right. You're right, I just-- I'm scared, Adam. - I know, me too, but we have to try. - OK. You're right. So what do we do? They could come in at any time. - So, let's distract them. - This is Comdr. McNeil, the officer in charge. Do you have any idea who the man with your son might be? - I'm afraid I don't. - I'm sure you understand how urgent the situation is. Scott and the other man are holding people hostage at gunpoint. - I'm sorry, but I--I have no idea why he is doing this. - Actually, Ms. Sanders, I might. Scott is in the bank for a reason. My sister works there. She's one of the hostages. - I don't understand. - Were Scott and Erik close? Mrs. Sanders? - Yeah, there was 10 years between them, but they were very close. And Scott got locked up. Erik always looked up to his older brother. He'd do anything just to impress him. - So Scott was obviously upset when Erik died? - I imagine he was, but I can't say. I haven't spoken to Scott in a long, long time. He went bad. And after awhile, I just wouldn't have him in my house. - Would you talk to him now? - Now? - We'd like to resolve this situation peacefully, Mrs. Sanders, so no one gets hurt. - Sometimes a family member, especially a parent, can break through when we can't. - Well, if I talk to Scott, it'll only make things worse. - But you're his mother. - I wasn't a good mother. The boys' father, he left us right after Erik was born. And Scott never forgave me. He blamed me for his father leaving. He hates me. I'm telling you, it'll just make things worse. - I understand. - But I meant what I wrote you. Erik was a good boy. He might have wanted to be like his brother, but he never could've been. I tell myself, every day, when he went in to rob that store, that he was only doing it so that he could get the money to come back home. I hope your sister and those other people are gonna be OK, but there's nothing I can do for you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - We need to talk. - What do you want? - We haven't eaten since breakfast. - You've got vending machines. - We don't have any change. - And some of us need to use the restroom. - OK. You, come here. We're gonna go to the lobby and get some coins. Come on. - Bathroom breaks, one at a time. You first. - I can hear something from inside the bank. - It's not working. - I'll be right out. - Do you feel better? - No, don't. Please, don't. Stop! - Got it! Come on. - Just leave it. Put the mat back. - I gotta make sure it opens. - The access door is opening. They're coming back! - Put the coins down there. Everybody get what you need. - Stop. Stop. - Oh, you like to play rough? I can play rough. - What's the matter, boys? You not hungry? - I can wait. - What the hell? - Back up, back up! Bravo one to control. Shots fired. Repeat, shots fired. - Go, go! - We're moving in. - What is this? Where's that go? Where's that go? - It's a-- It's an aqueduct. - Do you have the keys? Do you have the keys? - Yeah, yeah... - Lock it! Lock it! Get over there! - Go, go, go! Come on, come on, come on! - Bravo one to control. Come in. - Who was that? Who's shooting? Sit down. Sit down. I should kill you for that. - Don't! Please. Sit down. - Copy. They shot at the officers in the aqueduct. - Did the officers fire back? - No. - I don't wanna wait anymore. I wanna go now. - This is just a bump in the road. - I didn't come here to get hurt or killed. I came here for the money. Why did you come here, Scott? - Hello? - In the lobby. - The lobby camera. We have it up. - I'm assuming you've seen our van parked out in the alley. I want you to open all the doors so we can see that there's nobody inside. We're taking your sister with us. Any attempt to stop us or track us, well, you know what's gonna happen to her. You understand? - I understand. - Good. Do we have a deal? - No. You don't take Darcy. You take me. - Cameron, no. - That's the only deal we'll make. Take it or leave it. - Deal. I'll call you when we're ready with the van. - Well, looks like your sister is willing to die for you too. - What do you mean? - Come here. - What do you mean? - I can't let you do this. - I'm securing the release of hostages, Liam. That's my job. - This isn't gonna make up for what happened to Erik Sanders. You know that. - I've kind of reached a peace with that, But I could never find peace, ever, if something happened to my sister and I could have prevented it. - What kind of peace am I gonna find if something happens to you? - If our positions were reversed and I asked you not to do your job, would you back down? Liam, please. - We'll have your back all the way. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. - I know. - Yeah. - The van is ready and so am I. - We're good to go. - Hi. Pat her down. - She's clean except for this. - Throw it away. Get in. - They're on the move. - Police! Freeze! Nobody move! Stay right where you are! - They're not here. They both left. - All clear. - Where's my sister? - Come with me. - Everything's fine. It's over. - I don't think anyone's following us. - Of course they are. You just can't see them. There's a tracking device on the van. - There better not be. - Why? Because you're gonna kill me? You're gonna kill me anyway, Scott. It was supposed to be Darcy, wasn't it? That was the plan? Stage a bank robbery, take a hostage, kill her and have me suffer the loss, just like you did? - Lady, you don't know what you're talking about. - What is she talking about? - So you had to regroup and make it up as you went along, and instead of Darcy, you ended up with me. - Are you enjoying playing the martyr? - No. But what choice do I have? I have to protect her. She's my little sister. I understand what you're doing. It's not right. But I understand. - You don't understand anything. - Is there really a tracker on this van? - I know that you hold me responsible for Erik's death and you want me to pay for it. Well, I do pay. Every day. I tried to save your brother and I failed. And every time I think about that, my heart breaks all over again. - Do you know where it is? The tracker? - I love my sister as much as you loved your little brother, and I am ready to die for her, but let me be clear about this. If I die, you probably will too. - Do you know where it is? - Yes, and what I recommend you do is pull the van over, lay down your weapons and wait for the police. - So they can arrest us? You're crazy. - Well, if you don't, maybe you can get away. We haven't IDed you yet. But Scott's only hope is to turn himself in. - I'm not going back to jail. - Well, if you get out of this alive, you're going back to jail. But a bank robbery rap is a whole lot better than a murder one, that is life without. Because I know what's driving this, I promise to testify on your behalf and plead for leniency. - Is that the promise you gave to my brother? - Close. I wished I had the chance to keep it. - I want the tracker off this van now! - Jackson, give me an update. - They're at the riverfront. - If you're tracking them why don't you do something? Go get her. - I know you're worried, but trust us. Our only objective right now is to get Cameron back here safe. Besides, your sister can take care of herself. - OK, tell me where it is now. - It's under the van, next to the engine. - Hey! Hey! Get back! Hey! Get back in the van! - No. - I got it! Come on, man! We gotta get out of here! - Let me help you, Scott. Please. - Man, we're stopped! They're gonna be here any second! - I'm staying. - Ah! Oh, OK, I get it, I get it. You're gonna turn yourself in, you're gonna cop a plea and rat me out? - You know I would never do that. - I don't know what you'd do. You dragged me into this thing. You didn't tell me anything. You lied to me! - Hey! You got what you wanted! - We could've got out clean, but you had a plan! - That's right. I'm a selfish, manipulative piece of work. So do me a favour. Come on, do me a favour, huh? Shoot me. Do it! Then get in the van, get the money and get the hell out of here. - This is not over. This is not over! - There's another tracker in the van. - Yeah, I figured. - Mask must be suffocating. - It is. - You look like him. - That's what people say. I was his hero, you know. He wanted to be like me. - Copy. Sanders is in custody. Cameron is fine. - This is the police! Stop your engine! Put your hands in the air! - I don't have a gun! Don't shoot! - Here she is. Oh my god! You OK? You're OK. - Nice work. - Well, I couldn't have done it without you. - I didn't do anything. - You had my back. Made all the difference. And I'd love to have dinner with you sometime. - Pasta and shoes tomorrow? My treat. - Damn right, your treat. Closed captions: Vision Globale
