(woman coughs) (woman sniffs and coughs) (coughs) (newspaper page turns) (woman coughs) (newspaper page turns) (newspaper thuds) - Hmmm. (exhales) (spritzes) (blows) (coughs) Hmm. (inhales) - You know, there's this friend of my father's, went to the hospital, and, no, his wife, his wife, that's it. His wife went in hospital and he went into work, and, and when he got into work he said to his secretary, "My wife's gone into hospital today," and, and she thought he said, "My wife's gone into hospital to die." (chuckles) (person coughs) No, wait a minute. This man is an Australian, that's it. This man's an Australian, and, and he went into work, and he said to his secretary in an Australian accent, you see, he says, "My wife's, my wife's gone into hospital to die." You see, to die. He, he's Australian. Anyway, later in the day, oh, when he's leaving work, um, his secretary says to him, "I'm sorry to hear that that your wife is dying." And he says, "What do you mean?" Or rather, "What do you mean?" Because he's Australian and and she says, "Well, you came into work this morning and said that your wife has gone into hospital to die." (chuckles) Then he said, "No, no. So, she's gone into hospital to die, not to die." Um, and they both laughed and that was that. (chuckles) (woman coughs) And the funny thing was that she'd gone in for an ingrown toenail and did in fact die during the anesthetic. (chuckles) (blows) - [Nurse] Mr. Fripp? - Ah, nice talking to you. You get some gloomy ones here, Jo. You'd think it was a morgue. (chuckles) - [Nurse] Mr. Fripp. - Ah yes, Mr. Fripp. My name's Dr. Davidson, Dr. Dimoto's out today. - Pleased to meet you, doc. - Yes, this is Nurse Ganz, I don't believe you know her either. - Not in the biblical sense, no. (chuckles) - You seem in very high spirits today, Mr. Fripp. - Oh, I am too. I think I'm in line for promotion at the old firm. - I see, well this is about the results of your insurance medical service, so. - Yes. - If you will lie down, Mr. Fripp, I'd like to have a look at your chest. - Hmmm, I bet you're not the only one, right nurse? (chuckles) - Please, Mr. Fripp. (inhales) Yes, I think we need a little more than that, Mr. Fripp. (groans) - Macho man. - [Nurse] Oh, could you breathe in, please Mr. Fripp? - Oh. (inhales) (exhales) I've, I've never really been ill, you know. I've been very lucky. I used to have an aunt who always was thought I was ill, but mentally ill. She thought I was a mental deficient. (chuckles) She'd send my mother prospectuses for fashionable European lunatic asylums. And the ironic thing was that she did actually end up in a lunatic asylum, and I'm perfectly all right. (chuckles) - Yes Mr. Fripp, I'm afraid I do have some rather bad news. - Ah, well it's been a good day so far so, sock it to me doc. - Taking my findings today in conjunction with the test Dr. Dimoto took last week, it's quite clear that you have Hershing's disease. - Oh. Is that bad? - Well, it is very advanced. It's a disease that acts very much like, well, it's terminal. (ominous music) - In what sense? - In the sense that I'd say that you had less than 30 minutes to live. (gasps) (dramatic music) (inaudible) Hershing's disease is a very rare disease. Certainly the first time I've come across it. The chances of contracting it are, well, one in a million. (chuckles) - Ah, that's interesting. - I'm very sorry. - It's not a good piece of news, is it? - Right, it's not very good. - And you're quite sure? - Cross my heart and hope-- (chuckles) - Well, what sort of time are we talking about, then? - I think it should be all over by about 10 to. (chuckles) - Oh, gracious me. What am I going to do? What, what? - Well, perhaps you'd like to sit in the waiting room. We have some old copies of Punch. - No, no, I think I'll pop out for a freth of bresh air. Breath of fresh air. After all, I've got a whole life to live in 30 minutes. - It's a little less than that now, I think you'll find. - [Fripp] Why, what time do you make it? - 3:25. - Oh, 3:20, nurse. - Right, 27 minutes. No time to lose. 26 1/2 minutes, do something, do something, do everything. Bye! (frantic, energetic music) Oh! (yells) - Mrs. White? (door opens) (phone rings) - Um, excuse me. My name's Bernard Fripp, and I want to take out all my money. - Oh, well, if you could join one of the queues at the other till, they'll go and phone through to your branch. - Oh no, wait, I haven't got time to queue. (door squeaks opens) (thuds) (grunts) (distant typewriter keys clack) Damn. (phone rings) - I'm sorry. I want to check books. - You want to check the books? Are you an accountant? - Of course not, he's a bloody foreigner. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry Mr. Paripas, but you only seem to have a deposit account. Now, we can't issue you checkbooks on a deposit account. - A deposit? - That's right. You have to have a current account, current. - Deposit? - No, current. - A deposit? - No, current. - [Paripas] No current? - No, no, account. Indeed, on no account may you have a checkbook. - Oh, ah, oh. Oh damn! - Bloody upset, it's the Black Hole of Calcutta over again, I tell you. (typewriter keys clack) - [Teller] Look, Mr. Paripas, there's no money in your account. - You may be. - [Teller] One pound and 75 pence. (door closes) Opened at 10:30 yesterday morning. (thuds) And you have the same amount at three in the afternoon. - Come on, look, make your mind up. - We can both choose at the same time, really. (slaps) - Greedy, aren't we? - What was the weather like when you arrived here? Had Phoebus, fiery ironmonger of the gods, ridden his fiery chariot twixt mossy bank and frothy welkin? Or was it night? Had Dame Lunar, saucy virgin of the the nether regions, lit her lamp horn bright? - Right, I've finished now. (typewriter keys clack) - Oh no! No wait, no wait, no. (slams) Oh. Oh my god. (grunts) Oh look, look, I can't die in a bank. (chimes) So, no one's gonna help me? (phone rings) Right, just gonna have to bite my hand off. (phone rings) - Mr. Fripp, could you please come to the inquiries desk so we don't hold anyone else up? Thank you very much. (phone rings) - At last, my money, my money. - Now, if you could just sign that receipt for us. - All right. Do you have a pen? - No, I'm sorry, sir. - Well, does anyone else there have a pen? - Has anyone got a pen, please? No, I'm sorry. - But the answer can't be no. Look, I can't wait any longer. Does anyone have a pen? - Deposit? - Look, a pen, someone surely. Bloody bastards. All right, I'm coming through. There must be a pen there somewhere. - Oh, sir. - [Fripp] For goodness sake. (people arguing) - Oh, Mr. Fripp, please. (grunts) - [Man] Can't do that, sir. - Right then, shut up. Shut up, all of you. (typewriter keys clack) What are you doing with your lives that's so damn important you can't even find me a pen? I mean, suppose you died tomorrow. Funnier things have happened. I'm dying today, for example. And St. Peter at the pearly gates asks you what you've done with your lives. And you say, "I've worked in the bank "at the corner of Gloucester Street for 15 years," will he then say, "Oh, my son, "you have exceeded my expectations, "step royally into the house of heavenly peace." Will he, hell? He'll say, "You complete prick. "What do you think I gave you a brain for?" - Uh, Mr. Fripp, we found you a pen. - I said shut up. - Oh. - I have spent my years browsing through the hors d'oeuvres of life's rich menu, without ever really choosing a starter. And now, I've got 15 minutes left to live. And my advice to you is sod the starter, and get straight down to the main course. Because in the great restaurant of life, death is no waiter. He won't wait while you pansy around the wine list, he'll sling you out on death's dark highway before you can say Valpolicella. (triumphant music) Life is a sweet. Suck it. (gasps) Life is a fast-food store. Order a Whopper. - A Whopper? (frantic, energetic music) (footsteps clomp) (tumbles) (metal scrapes) (footsteps click) Oh, now where am I going? I've got 12 minutes left and I'm at a bit of a loose end. Oh. (metal scrapes) (thuds) (airy, pleasant music) Excuse me, you look like an intelligent sort of fellow. - Sorry? - Forget it. - It's rather fine. - Yeah, I agree. (men chatter) (people chatter) - Ah. Look, you look like an intelligent sort of fellow. What would you do if you had all the money in the world and all the time in which to spend it? - Oh, an interesting question. - Be quick, please. - Oh, I suppose I'd try and see all the great art. - Ah. - Read all the great books, listen to all the great music, sleep with a lot of expensive women, that sort of thing. (chuckles) - And how long do you think that would take? - Yeah, I suppose a good 10 years all told. - Oh dear, I've only got about 10 minutes. Um, do you have any suggestions? Do you know of any great art in this area? - Well, you could see some reproductions of great paintings at the poster shop just a few blocks-- - Good idea! Oh, good idea, yes, I'll do that, thank you, thank you. (airy, pleasant music) Yes. (frantic, energetic music) - Oh. (door shakes) Oh no. What? You can't be out to lunch. (knocks) (knocks) Is it? (door opens) I-- Oh. Uh. (paper rustles) Have you got the Mona Lisa? - No, not the real one, mate, sold it yesterday. - No, I mean a copy. (weight falls) - Yeah, it's in between the Aborigine reading Playboy and the tennis player with no knickers on. - Ah, right. Oh. What's meant to be so good about it? - I don't know. I think it's made to be something to do the lips, I think. - Hmmm. Well, to be absolutely frank, (poster falls) I prefer blondes. Thank you. (frantic, energetic music) That's you. Um, I've just seen the Mona Lisa. Lovely, what else? What else, books, music, women? - Yeah, ah, yes. Well, um. - Uh. - I say, you really are in a bit of a hurry, aren't you? Well. - Yeah. - You could try Covent Garden Market, there's a lot of action down there. - Oh, all those tourists love it. - I believe you can get pretty well everything down there. - Everything? - Almost everything. - Oh, sounds perfect, um. Could you just shout some directions as I go to save time? - [Man] Um, say, go to the end. - Fine. - That's it. The first left. Ah no. Right! No, sorry, actually, sorry. Straight across the road. - All right, thank you. - Then, right down that very narrow alley. (footsteps clomp) Good, and, right. (frantic, energetic music) No, left. Yes, well, he should just about be there by now. (frantic, energetic music intensifies) (footsteps clomp) - Do you have War and Peace, please? Excuse me, I'm looking for a copy of War and Peace. Fine. (thumps) - Can I help you? - Yes, I'm looking for War and Peace. - Middle shelf on the left. - Ah, right. Right, War and Peace, War and Peace, War and Peace, War and Peace. Oh no, I can't read this. Ah, ha. Oh, I see. I see. Yes, all right. Hmm, typical. Well, I could have guessed as much. Oh bugger! Oh, I could have ordered that, bloody frog. Part two, damn. Part two, Part two, Part two, Part two, Part two, Part two, Part two, Part two. Ha! Serves him right. (chuckles) Oh dear. Oh, oh good. Oh hell. Oh well, great, classic. Thanks, thanks so much! Uh. Oh. Uh. (whimpers) (kicks) Bloody Russkies. (footsteps clomp) Ah. (sniffs) (exhales) Hmm, not, not, not bad. (thuds) (footsteps clomp) (punk rock music) ♪ Take on (mumbles) ♪ And don't ask your parents ♪ 'Cause they ain't got too wear ♪ ♪ He don't read the papers ♪ 'Cause you'll be - Sorry, are you all right? - What? - I believe you were having some kind of fit. - Oh, no. - All right, carry on, dude. Excuse me. - Hey man, wait your turn. - Sorry, I'm very short of time. I've only got seven minutes to live. - Okay. - I, I just want a piece of music. It goes da-da-da, da da, da da da da da da. (chains jingle) (groans) (thuds) - Come again? - It goes something like da-da-da, da da, da da da da da da. - Da, da, da, da. - Da da da, da da. Da daaa. - [Cashier] Da, da, da, da, da. Da, da da, da da da, da da. - That's, that's the Adagio in G minor by Albinoni. - Ha! - It's right over here. ♪ Da, da da, da da ♪ Da da da da da - No, in the booth. - Ah. Oh. If I die in there, this is my work number. ("Adagio in G minor" by Albinoni) (emotional orchestral music) (gasps) (plastic squeaks) Oh, this is ridiculous. Look. Go to a health farm or something. (bills rumple) Now, women. (frantic, energetic music) (people chatter) Reverend. (yells) Reverend, Reverend, Reverend! (footsteps click) Reverend. Reverend. Reverend. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. Reverend! Reverend. Wait. Wait, Reverend. - Yes? - Uh. Wait. - I'm waiting. - Um, I'd just like to have a word or two with you about Heaven and Hell. The other place. Um. - Relax, now, relax. - It's a question of commandments, isn't it, really? I mean have, I've never committed adultery with my neighbor's wife or with my neighbor's ass, for that matter. I've always honored by father and mother, off and on, yes, I believe I lose a few points on that, damn. - Now look, wait, now, wait, relax. This is not just a question of commandments, um. - What? - Um. - Oh, Bernard. - Bernard, it's not just a question of the commandments. Physically, actually, Bernard, but the spirit of them. - I see. - Take the adultery one, for instance. Number six, no, seven, adultery, yes. The Lord said that he who so much as look upon a woman with lust is also doomed. - Hmm? - You see, what he's saying is that the sin of the thought, the sin of the spirit is, in actual fact, as bad as the sin itself. - Sorry? - The sin of the spirit is, in actual fact, as bad as the sin itself. - Yes, I'm not listening to you, am I? - Aren't you? - No. Um, but basically, what you're saying is that any self-respecting man who isn't a homosexual is doomed from the word go. - Yes, that's right. As, indeed, are homosexuals, of course, Bernard. - Ah yes, of course. Great. - All right. - Thanks. Thank you. (grunts) Sorry. Madam, hey look, hey-- - Bernard. - Yes? Oh, hello. - Hi. How are you? - What? - How are you? (chuckles) - What a bloody stupid question. Hup! (frantic, energetic music) (footsteps click) (footsteps click) Oh! (inaudible) (people chatter) (fire roars) (flute music) (jovial Renaissance music) (frantic, energetic music) (tuba music) (frantic, energetic music) Oh god. What have you got against me? - Sir? Hello, sir. Sir, would you like to experience another world? - Sod off. - All right, then. - Oh God, of course I'm gonna die and now I lose-- Oh, thanks! (patrons chatter) (relaxed music) (woman squeaks) (grunts) (slides) (thunks) Oops. Oh. (mutters) Do you mind if I have a cigarette? - No, no, go ahead. - Well, thanks. (matches shake) (match lights) (thuds) (coughs) Um, are you busy at the moment or what? - Sorry? - Nothing, it's just that, well, there's nothing really, it's just that I'm dying in about five minutes. And as I was dying, I was just wondering if you fancied, um. A bit of love or something. - You're gonna die? - Yep. - How are you gonna die? - Well, I don't know, really. Just sort of stop breathing, and what have you. Um, nothing spectacular. I'm not gonna fall on my own sword or anything. (laughs) It's this, it's this thing called Hershing's disease, I don't know if you even should know about it, it's, um, it's worse than terminal cancer. - Worse than cancer? Oh my god, you poor thing. Oh my god. Oh. Oh. - Oh great. Look, please don't faint. Look, you're doing a very good impersonation of me in five minutes time, do you realize that? Oh, why do women faint? Excuse me, do you know anything about women? - Well, what happened? - Well, she fainted. - Shame on you. - Oh thanks. Right, come on. Sorry, I must be off. - I beg your pardon. - Look, sorry, I must go, I got to go and enjoy myself, unfortunately. - Wait a minute. - I'd never met her before. Complete stranger. Foreigner, for all I know. - Oh no, she's not. I heard them talking together in English. You were trying to pick her up. - I was-- - Disgusting. - But I wasn't trying to pick her up. - At tea time? Horrible. - You don't leave here till she's up. - All right, come on, Dottie. A joke's a joke. (chuckles) Come along, let's be having you. Thanks for your help, everyone. It's just a little joke between ourselves. Come on, Dottie. Up you go, oh. (grunts) Oh, oh, you've put on some weight, Dottie. Great big fat thing. (chuckles) All right. Bye, have to go, bye. (footsteps click) (door closes) (footsteps click) (birds twitter) (church bells ring) (footsteps click) (frantic, energetic music) Oh, god. I've got three minutes to live. Oh, three minutes. What do you think of that? Oh, not three decades, not three years. Not even three hours. Two and 3/4 bloody minutes. Bloody swizz is what I say. (traffic hums) I'm scared. (airy, hopeful music) God bless me. - Are you all right? - Oh. Yes. Yes I am, yes. - I saw you in the shop earlier today, talking to a priest. - Ah yes. - But, are you in despair? - Ah, yes. Yes. Yes, I suppose I am. - Really? - Well, you know how long it takes to boil an egg, if you like it quite runny? - Three minutes. - That's how long I've got to live. - Well, you must be joking. - No, no I mean it. I found out just now. Doctor. - That's impossible. I used to be a nurse, and I've never heard of anything that kills you that quickly. (engine revs) What's the name of your doctor? - Davidson, Dr. Davidson. - In St. Martin's Court? - Yes, that's right. - Well, I can't believe it. There must be some kind of mistake. Don't worry, I'll go and ring. - Oh wait, don't go. - But we've got to find out what's going on. - Ah yes, yes, I supposed we have. Uh, oh look, get to the point. I wonder if-- - Shall I give you a goodbye kiss, just in case you don't last it out 'til I get back? - You took the words right out of my mouth. - Well, here. (church bell rings) - Well, goodness. - I better go and make that call. I'm sure there's some mistake. - Oh wait, wait a minute. You know, I've always thought that there were certain things in life that, that if I'd done them, I wouldn't have minded dying. Like, meeting Bing Crosby or, or writing Strangers in the Night. Well, kissing you. (spritzes) Is up there with them. - Thank you very much. (wedding bells chime) (fireworks explode) I better go. Name and address? - My name is Bernard Fripp, and I live at 37A Welkin Avenue. (engine revs) (dials) (frantic, energetic music) One minute to go. Funny how time flies when you're enjoying yourself. (engine revs) Look, here. Um, uh. Look, take this. (phone rings) (engine revs) Buy your parents something expensive for Christmas, buy them a servant or something. (frantic, energetic music) All right, all right. - Look Mom, the man gave me some money! - Oh, no. Wait a minute, wait, what are you doing, what are you doing? - Going over there. - Well, but you mustn't just cross the road. Don't you know the Green Cross Code? (frantic, energetic music) (phone rings) It's look left, look right, then listen, then look around, and then cross. - What? - I'll show you. (traffic buzzes) - Mr. Fripp! Mr. Fripp! (claps) It was a mistake. - James! - [Dr. Davidson] Mr. Fripp. - Then (mumbles). - [Dr. Davidson] Mr. Fripp, it was a mistake. - And then, then look around. - [Dr. Davidson] You're not well. - And then look straight ahead. - But you're going to be all right. - And then, and then, cross. (engine revs) (tires squeal) (tires squeal) (engine revs) Bloody hell. - James! - Mummy! - Dr. Davidson! - Joanna! - Come on, mate, off you go, go on. (engine revs) - Mr. Fripp, Mr. Fripp. - Yes? - You're going to be all right. - What? (engine runs) - One of the specimens got mixed up. (chuckles) You're not well, but you're going to be all right. - What? You mean? I'm going to be all right? - Yes. (chuckles) I don't believe it. (laughs) You know, I said to you, when I came into your surgery this afternoon, I had a feeling it was going to be a lucky day. - What? - I said. (truck engine revs) - No! (brakes squeal) (peppy electronic music)
