- Brixton! Right, drink? Yeah, cool. So how was your holiday? - Oh yeah, it was so good. I loved it, like, Istanbul is pretty amazing. - Yeah? - Yeah. Especially 'cause I was working for like four weeks solid before I went. - Yeah. - So it was a really well deserved break. - I'd love to go, it sounds amazing. - Oh, I know, we totally should, like-- - Hang on. What happened to caff? - Yeah, man, they had to close down. - What? - Yeah. - Last time I was here you said they were doing all right. - I think he's got some kind of online thing going. Let me go. No. You can't stop me from leaving. - I know. - So let me go. No, no, hang on, wait. - Sorry. - Sorry. What's the problem? - Well, it's basically rape, isn't it? I don't get your point. - Well, one minute she's saying let me go, and he doesn't let her, and, and then the next minute they're having hot, rough sex on the floor. She doesn't know what she wants. - Well it seems like she wants to leave. That's what she says. What she wants is to have hot, rough sex on the floor. - I'm having problems getting from the no to the yes. - Yeah, that's okay, that's okay. Just um... just think about it. Have you ever said something but meant something else? Not in a rape context, no. - Stop, stop calling it that. - John. Maybe we can take a break. - Yeah, that's all well and good but will we have enough time with 12 girls to see? So what's it gonna be? - Look, you don't have to do it, it's fine. - No, it's fine, we'll try again. - Good. That's the spirit. Let's take it from "Let me go!" I just wanna hear the words of truth. I like truth. - Let me go! - No. - You have to let me go. Whoa, whoa, what's wrong? - I just can't. What the fuck, Mickey? - Sorry. She's fucking up the vibe. - It might be a script issue. - I think we're done here. - Okay, thank you. - What you doing? Hey! Hey, hey! Hang on a second. - What? - Look, he's just really tired. I'm just not feeling it. - Look, will you give me a second? Look, you know I get to have a bit of a say about what happens on this project, right? - Yeah, I know you're famous. - That's got nothing to do with it, come back. Let's workshop it, we can make some changes, I know that character needs some work done on it. - Yeah, it doesn't make any sense. - Well look, let's do it. We've seen a load of girls this week. Look, I shouldn't really say it but you've been the best by far. We could meet up tomorrow. Just you and me, we could have a look at the script then. Where are you based? Brixton. - Brixton. Really? I've literally just moved into a flat there. Rushcroft Road. John's got your number, right? Can I text you later? - If I say yes will you let me leave? - Yes. Then move. Nice jacket, by the way. That's what I remember. I remember! I remember getting stripped, I remember getting beaten. I remember them laughin', laughin' in my face, spittin' on me! - So, how did it go? - One character was called Brown Vixen. What? - It's a step-up from Hood Girl. - Yeah, I suppose. Do we have to go out? Yes, we have to. - Why? - Because I've set you up on a date. - What, you said we were going to a gig. - We are. We're gonna see my mate Ayo play. - No! Oh my God, Isha, why? - It's not really a date. It's more like two friends hanging out in a bar with drinks and soft lighting. - No. - Come on. No, no. - One drink, Nina. One drink, I promise. And then we'll leave. Please? - One drink. I can't believe you. I can't believe you. Let's do this. ♪ And it rang ♪ And it rang ♪ And it rang ♪ And it rang ♪ And it rang ♪ And it rang ♪ And it rang ♪ And it rang - And then I finally picked up the phone. The end, show's over. Thanks for coming, guys. - Let's just go. - No, no, let's go say hi! Hey, homie! - Hey! Thanks for coming down. - Of course. - What you think? - Yeah, it was good. It was intense, but what happened to your band? - Fuckin' with the process, I had to fire them. Hey. What'd you think? - Oh, um ... I didn't get it. Really, what didn't you get? - Any of it? - Well, were you listening? - Guys, introductions. Ayo, this is Nina, Nina, this is Ayo. As you both know, I'm hooking you up tonight, so how about we don't talk about the show? But I'll see you guys later with babies! - So what didn't you get? I don't think we're allowed to talk about that. - Why, because you weren't listening? - No, no, I think I was, that's how I figured out that I didn't get it. - I specifically asked Isha for someone who's into art. - So, because I didn't get your show, I'm not into art? That's pretty pretentious. Look, Isha set this up, clearly neither of us is interested, but let's just humor her and get a drink, shall we? Alright. What you do? - She didn't say? - She said you were talented. - Really? - Nah. - You really can't take criticism, can you? I mean, when you were screaming, "And it rang, and it rang" like a fucking maniac, who was ringing? - God. God? - Yeah. - And what did he want? - He wanted me to pick up the phone. - Why, so he could tell you to rehire your band? Why did you fire them anyway? - Creative differences, I evolved, they didn't. - Well, it takes some guts to switch out like that, so ... - Thanks. So, Isha says you live in Brixton. - Mm-hmm. You going to reclaim? - Yeah, definitely. - Cool. Fuckin' hate what's going on down there, they kicked me out of my squat. So, do you wanna tour this place? - What, now? Yeah. - Okay? Look, run your idea past me again. - Look, I want my next project to be about the changes in Brixton. - Why? - Half the people we used to know don't live anymore, the shops we used to go to when we were kids, they're all closing down. I mean, you can tell, there's this weird atmosphere around here now. I just think that this project is what I've been looking for. What? - I just think it's a really complex situation, Nina. - Yes, but do you remember how no-one used to wanna come here? How we would lie to people at school about where we live 'cause we were so embarrassed. I've seen those people by the way, and they live here now. - You know how much I hated that place, but I mean, why were we even there? Why was everything we were told to aspire to as far away from this place as possible? Can we really be mad at people for valuing it now? - I think we can. I mean, Reclaim has 5,000 people signing up to attend the event. I'm gonna go, film, see what I can get. - Look, cool. What do you need? Like, what kind of project is it? - Well, I haven't put a label on it now, but I, I'm gonna get some interviews, and I don't know, could you edit? - Sure. What's the budget? - Bitch, please. We need to close down the prisons! We need to erase people from retention! We need to support the women on hunger strike! All those scum are the ones ... We take London, and we take Brixton! - Hiya. Excuse me, I'm doing a visual arts project. And I was just wondering if you'd like to do an interview. - So, which organization are you from? It's just me. It's kind of like a visual arts project. It's my own thing where I'm just exploring the subject and what reclaiming Brixton means to you. What do you think? It's just two questions. - Go on then. Cool. All right so, if you just stand there. Yeah, we'll get your sign as well, that's cool. - The reason why Brixton is so popular is because it's so diverse. Anything that you want to buy, you can come to Brixton and you can get it. It doesn't matter where you are in the world, you can come to Brixton and you can find it. - We were a part of the riots, we are part of that story of the building up of Brixton, and so it's very, very important for me to be here and for me to show my presence, and to support reclaim Brixton. - Here in Brixton right now, the real people, the people that are part of this community are being forced out. This is years back in the 70's and 80's, there was wholesale redevelopment, whole communities were destroyed and pushed out, it wasn't so much about money, but now these developers don't give a flying fuck about, they don't have a social conscience. They don't care about these communities, whether they be social or living, all they're interested in, one thing, and that is this, right? It's how big this money is. And they say, oh right, we'll give you a new home, you can go to Hastings, you can go halfway across the country. It's destroying whole families, and communities, and I actually live in Peckham. I live in Nunhead near Peckham. Right, and people are saying, oh, Peckham's gonna become trendy, and I say, for fuck's sake, don't let Peckham become trendy! Like Brixton has become. Because the thing about Peckham it's got the largest Nigerian population in London. It's down-to-earth, what you see is what you get, there's no Costa fucking Coffee, or Foxtons, it's straightforward, down-to-earth. Please don't make Peckham trendy like Brixton! Thank you. - These are the journals of God. Therefore, our dearly loved children. The word can only attend these if we live according to the word of the Bible. In the name of the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Live a life of love just like Christ loved us, he gave himself up for us. And as a sacrifice to God. And you have all the power, the all-conquering all-merciful, all graceful God. You will have the power when the holy spirit comes unto you. This is where you live? - It's temporary. - And it's just you here? - Yeah, but it's just for a couple of weeks while I sort myself out. - Sort yourself out? - Yeah. So what do you think of my plan? - Your plan has one major flaw. What's that? - You. - What? You're essentially gentrification. I grew up here. - Look, you might have grew up here back in the day, but things have changed. And now you're occupying space, like this. - It's a favor, it's just for a few weeks. - I wanna help. I fucking hate what's going on here with people like you. I joke. I don't hate you. But if you wanna do this project, you seriously have to acknowledge your part in all this. - My part? - I'd say the thing to Isha. - Wake up Brixton. Wake up, this isn't Thorston, this isn't Shoreditch. It's not all about wheat-free, gluten-free, frappuccinos, yeah, yeah, you drink your coffee, but you understand that we're still here, the real Brixton is still here that we need to respect, we need to be recognized, we need to be understood. It's all the same to you, isn't it? You just ignore, but we're still here, we're still part of this place. You try and buy us out, you try and beat us out, but we might just have to burn it down. - These developers-- So what do you think? - I'm gonna need some more time. - No, about him blaming us for gentrification. - Don't you have to be white to do that? - Just 90 % of the time. - I was born and raised here, I think it's bull to put me in that bracket. - Exactly. - But he has a point with you. - What? - I mean, you left. You left for a while, to make it worse you went to East London. Everyone knows that's ground zero for the hipster apocalypse. - It's not my fault my mum was uppity, you know what she's like. You got me this place. At a rate I couldn't afford. - So what, do you think I look fucking stupid doing this? - Look, just acknowledge it in the work. Your new home, you can go to-- Okay. What are you doing there? - I'm just eating kale. I can see that. Why? - Just what I do all day. After pilates and yoga, and a little trip to Pret. Couldn't you get a little bit of a protein or carb with that? I mean, nobody just eats kale like that. - How would you know? I don't. - Sure you don't dabble? Absolutely not. I don't even touch foods with the letter O in them in case it's organic. - Very deep of you. I know. Taste good? - I put so much seasoning on it. I'm gonna gag. I don't even know how you can eat that stuff. I'm more of a spinach girl. - I get what you think of me, and I accept it, I've spoken to Isha, and I wanna approach this in a sensitive way. I wanna meet people, I want to get their stories, I wanna see how they feel, and I think that you are the person that is gonna bring me to those people. - Let me think about it. - What is there to think about? - They're my people. It's not just putting you in contact, it's vouching for you. - So vouch for me! - Well let me think about it. So, I was thinking. I want someone to record my next performance. - Oh really? - Yes, really. - I guess I'll think about it. So what is your next performance? You've had a call from God, you've resurrected Christ. What's next, bum-raped by Satan? - Do you know, I don't think you're engaging with my work. - I guess ... I think that you hide behind it. I mean, yeah, it's a big spectacle, but I ... I guess I struggle to see what it's all about, really. - I think I could say the same thing about you. I think it's really important to figure out why you're trying to create this project. Is that cool? - Yeah. I don't think it'll make the final edit though, 'cause ... I just don't feel that comfortable with sharing that side. That's fine, but I think it'll be really good for your own records, and it'll help. - Okay. So tell me about your experiences of depression. - I've struggled with depression since I was a teen. What does it look like? For you. - I don't think I wanna say much more than that to be honest. I think that's fine, like. I think it's important. If you want people to share themselves with you, I think it's important for you to share yourself with them. - Yeah, but we're talking about a subject, a very specific subject. I wanna talk ... Just, just stick to ... I think it's relevant to the subject, I mean, we're talking about gentrification here, and the changes, you know. How do you know the people that you're not talking to don't, or aren't affected by the same things that you are? - I'm just hoping to discover that. Look, just stop asking me, okay? I don't really wanna go much further with that, I've given you as much of an answer as I wanna give. Yeah, but I think your depression's important to why you're doing this project. - Isha, you've never asked me this before, and you're asking me now. With a camera there. That's okay. I'm being honest with you now. - You're sick! What are you doing? Just leave it! I'm just trying to work out why you're trying to create this project. I'm trying to get to know - Yeah, but-- Where you're at. - That, it doesn't have anything to do with it. It doesn't have anything to do with it, okay? I was looking for something. I get my inspiration from the street, that's it. It clearly bothers you, so I think it's important. Can we stop? What's this project about then? - It's just about Brixton and how much it's changed. I've been away for a few years, and when I came back it was just don't know, it was a shock. - So the point still stands. You wouldn't be in my film, but you want me to be in yours. - It's not really a film. - Right. Well, I haven't got anything interesting to say about it. Still a good investment, that's it. - That's the point, years ago, that wouldn't have happened. - Yeah, because I never had any money. - And because someone in your position wouldn't have wanted to come here. - Oh, right, so you wanna class me as the villain now? - Look, I'm trying to show all sides of the argument. Think about it. It'd be great to have someone with your profile involved. - Right, if I do it, I'm gonna want something in return. - Like what? - Wouldn't you like to know? - So you're a filmmaker? - Yeah, well this is more of a visual art project. But I'm really excited about it, and I'm so happy that Ayo put us in touch. - Is that how you met, through film? - No, we were introduced by a mutual friend. - Cool, have you been filming for long? - A few years now. But this project is really fresh. - Okay, so in a nutshell, what, what are you trying to achieve here? - Well, Ayo said you work in the community, holding discussions and protests, and I was hoping to film some of these, or interview some people involved. - Yeah, I know that but I think my question is why? - I wanna address the changes. - And what does that really mean? I don't get your politics. I'm interested in how the old community gets sort of pushed out and sterilized. And all we've got left are gourmet-fried chicken shops and Bob Marley hats but no black people, you know what I mean? - Yeah. Yeah, I get you. But, I don't think this is just about race. - Well, we're in Brixton, there's no real separating this from race anymore. I mean, take a good look at what's going on. - I am. - You want to make this piece of art, I get it, you wanna make a difference, but I need to protect the people I work with, and make sure they're not exploited. - Mmm. I'm not trying to exploit anyone, I'm just trying to help. - Help who? Look, my advice, do some research. - Well, I mean, this would definitely be part of it, and I am, I'm walking the streets, I'm really observing what's around me, and to meet the people you know would just be the next step, it would be so helpful. - Okay, but have you done any groundwork, like have you looked at sort of, I don't know, case histories or Brixton in the past, photographs. - No, but that's a great idea. I really wanna explore that route. And you know, I'm from Brixton, I'm from the area, I feel very attached to it, so yeah, I think I can bring a really honest and sensitive portrayal. - So is it from your viewpoint, or is it-- - Yeah, I wanna talk about gentrification. - Okay well, it sounds, dunno, it sounds really interesting, it sounds like an interesting project. - Cool. ♪ Past this street, quarter to three ♪ ♪ Heading to the all night Turkish grocery ♪ ♪ Girl in front of me once she grabbed ♪ ♪ Made me flash right back to flap mou-chaff ♪ ♪ Just the bowl of Brooklyn be ♪ Funny how little things ♪ Take you right back there ♪ Coming out Subway at about 5 a.m., ♪ ♪ Memory of this little jam ♪ Who's a veritable sign in a crosshats sights ♪ ♪ Makes my Wednesday evening dream of Wednesday night ♪ ♪ Came the Camberwell from the pubs ♪ ♪ Lost a little reserve ♪ Strutting like it's really in the spug ♪ ♪ The hipsters slop the bathing ♪ ♪ Talk to mates and stay the walk ♪ ♪ Swear I was in East New York ♪ East New York ♪ Sometimes these Southland streets ♪ ♪ Remind me of Brooklyn ♪ Sometimes these Southland streets ♪ ♪ Remind me of Brooklyn ♪ Sometimes these Southland streets ♪ ♪ Remind me of Brooklyn ♪ Sometimes these Southland streets ♪ ♪ Remind me of Brooklyn ♪ Jesus turned water into wine ♪ A plane ticket right now would do just fine ♪ ♪ Down the road in Dulwich ♪ They be living up nice ♪ Kinda life for me ♪ There's always two sides ♪ Things are changing anything in Peckham ♪ ♪ Not just the gangs, normal buses ♪ ♪ Bend it like Beckham ♪ Now be cage some blue, some red ♪ ♪ Both eat jerk chicken hard dough bread ♪ ♪ It's like a fountain of an unf ♪ ♪ When my spaceship hit planet Brooklyn's turf ♪ ♪ And I they welcome me there too ♪ ♪ Totem and bush with my feedback soon ♪ ♪ But it's June turn into June ♪ I can't lie, some more Brixton held ♪ ♪ And Crown Heights, but sister Rasta ♪ ♪ Still got the same vibes ♪ Oh my, sometimes these Southland streets ♪ ♪ Remind me of Brooklyn ♪ Sometimes these Southland streets ♪ ♪ Remind me of Brooklyn ♪ Sometimes these Southland streets ♪ ♪ Remind me of Brooklyn ♪ Sometimes these Southland streets ♪ ♪ Remind me of Brooklyn ♪ They just designed all the time ♪ ♪ In the people on ♪ Ain't just because and the drugs ♪ ♪ And the dealers ♪ Uh oh ♪ Aint just the bus put your mind into a fever ♪ ♪ Oh yeah ♪ It's just the way every day ♪ I get that feeling ♪ Oh ♪ It's just these Southland streets ♪ ♪ Remind of Brooklyn ♪ It's just these Southland streets ♪ ♪ Remind me of Brooklyn ♪ Sometimes these Southland streets ♪ ♪ Remind me of Brooklyn ♪ Sometimes these Southland streets ♪ ♪ Remind me of Brooklyn - Always nice to see Big Ben. - You ever spoken to him? - Yeah, I've tried but it's a bit hard, he's a bit scatterbrained. - Do you know anything about him? - Well legend has it that during the riots he took a knock to the head. - I thought that was a myth. - No, it's real, he's proper old school Brixton. You know what, I'm really liking what you're doing here. It might even work for the pop up exhibition that I'm having. - Seriously? - Yeah. Nothing concrete yet but, this is what we should be talking about, right? - Thanks. It's great. Yeah, I'm happy with what we've got. - Me too. I'm gonna talk to Dionne again. - Why? You think she was too hard on you? - No. What? What? Let's have a look at these shots you've got. Spielberg. - This is a lady that runs a cafe down the road. - Oh really, which one? - Art Nouveau? - Okay, yeah, I know the place. - Yeah, I was just walking past and I went in and I managed to speak to her and I think she talks about some really interesting things that you might be interested in. - Sure, okay. Do I just press? - Yeah, you just. My name is Betty Almahari. I'm East African, Eritrea. I'm a single mum with two boys, and my relationship with Brixton started 10 years ago when I moved in to the Guinness Trust of Somerlayton road. I don't want, you know, a big business, or medium business to come in there and gentrify the Atlantic Road more. I'd rather just keep it as it is. And continue to fight. So the battle's not over. You have to be down and out, and completely kind of like, having nothing for the system to help you. And if you try and do and create something and make something out of your life, then they do every single thing to make sure you don't succeed. This is not a coincidence, this is like a plan, and even, Lambas called it, the master plan. It's a plan to completely change an area, okay? Why are you changing the shops? And you're getting rid of local people and building luxury flats. My relationship with Brixton will end. Since I've moved from Guinness Trust, I'm not able to go back to where I used to live. Because it has so much memory. And it's quite painful, yeah, so it'll be the end. - So? - Yeah, I mean it's, it's quite poignant, how did you get her to kind of do this sort of interview? - Well, I just went into the cafe, told her a bit about the project and what I'm hoping to do and yeah, I was really surprised that she was so willing to share with me and I was really happy. - Oh, so she just kind of was open and just answered all your questions? Yeah, yeah. - That's really... Nothing too controversial please. - No. I'll make sure you feel comfortable-- That laugh sounds ominous. - I just want the truth. Right, cool. Don't we all? - Right. You ready? - Ready. On your marks. Sit up straight. Will do, sorry. Sorry Miss. Okay. Name. Mickey Roland. Occupation. - Actor. And you may have recognized me from films such as, don't laugh! I'm actually gonna do it to camera. You may recognize me from films such as The Engines of Fury 5, the Iron Will, or more recently, the Engines of Fury 6: The Thunder Road. - Nice. I don't even want you to cut that, that's good material. - Right, okay. I'd like to ask you about your relationship with gentrification. - Yeah, sure, okay. Well, I'm from Bermondsey in South London. I grew up on an estate there. Born and bred, normal working class family. What part of Bermondsey? - Spa Road, do you know it? Right, well it's, I went to secondary school just off the old Kent Road. Which is near there. I suppose my relationship with gentrification started there really. I started to notice a few arty types, a bit like you, popping up, and then they were followed by the more affluent people. The quinoa and kale brigade. Definitely cut that. My manager will kill me if he finds out. He loves quinoa. - Okay! All right, just focus. Sorry, sorry. - Can you talk about why you bought property in Brixton? - Right, I suppose I'll tell you a bit about, came round to that, I, fast forward a few years, and I suppose I'm lucky enough to be in a position with the films and that to be able to look an buying some property, and other friends and people I knew were kind of talking about Brixton, and Elephant and Castle as places to, that were good to invest to buy a flat. What do you think was attracting people to Brixton? - Transport links, a vibrant community, all the rest. Do you spend much time in Brixton? - Yeah, but like years ago. - What do you think of the term "social cleansing"? - Well, it's not really a good thing, is it? Well, certain members of the community think that's what's happening here. What do you think about that? - Okay. Well I can see, right, why some people may think that, but I don't think that is the full picture about what's happening round here. I'm not sure what you're quite trying to get me to say, but I don't think that it's rich people trying to displace poor people. Think about crazy London property prices, for example, that affects everyone. - And yet many poor people can't afford to live in their own communities anymore. Do you visit your old community in Bermondsey? - I haven't been there in a while. There's not that much there for me anymore. - So Bermondsey as you knew it no longer exists. I guess not. - Let's talk about race. Okay, cut it. - What? - Are you joking, cut it. I thought this was supposed to be a conversation. It is! - Yeah, well it feels a bit more like an interrogation at the moment, actually. What are you gonna ask me about next? What my bank statements look like? Where I do my grocery shopping? I don't think so, cut it! And I wanna have a look at that edit before you do anything with it. - Do you want this date or not? Unbelievable. Yeah, that's great, thanks. - Oh, don't wanna party? It's too early. - It's not! - Cheers. - Cheers. So have all your interviews ended in a bust up? - Well. You're my first diva actor so. Right? - Yeah! Diva actor? Yeah. - Look, I do appreciate what you're trying to do with the project. - You get it, do you? - Course I do. I just don't wanna be made to look like an idiot. Like a diva actor. - Well, maybe don't act like one then. Anyway, I don't wanna talk about work. - Okay, well let's talk about you then, when do you move here from Shoreditch? - I don't wanna talk about that either. Oh, goodness me, what do you-- - I wanna do something, I wanna do something fun! Like what? - I dunno. Oh, this is your date, by the way, so. Oh, is it? - Yeah. - You sprung that on me. Well. - You're good at that, aren't you? Springing things on people. Enjoy it while it lasts. - Right. Well, we could go for dinner. We could go dancing. - Let's have a dance-off. - I haven't had a dance-off since I was about 14. I heard you were a professional dancer. - Oh really? Who told you that? - It was on your Spotlight-- - Because it's true. - It was on your Spotlight CV! It's a shame you can't be in the film. - Huh? It's a shame you can't be in my film. - Who says I'm not? Well you said-- - I don't wanna talk about work! Oh God, right. - Why do you keep trying - Well put some music on then - To talk about work? - And let's dance. - Yes, let's dance, come on. - All I'm saying, is that it needs to go further, we need to push it. 'Cause what them guys put together weren't no protest, man, it was a street party. - No, there were a lot a positives. Positives like what? - No-one's saying it was perfect. - But we need to take the lead now. They've had their event, there's momentum, but we need to do something. - I think we need to focus more on people on the front lines, and there are people battling eviction as we speak, we need to make sure we've got the money to pay for their campaign. - Yeah, but then we're gonna lose momentum and all that's gonna happen is that Reclaim are gonna throw another fucking party. It's much more than that. - Sorry, what? - Well, I found Reclaim really useful. And I met a lot of people that felt the same. - Sorry, who are you again? - I'm making a project about the changes in the area. - What kind of project? - It's a mixture of things. - So what's the angle? I haven't decided that yet. - That's why she's here, to get a full range of opinions. - Reclaim Brixton was anti-black, and anti-working class. Seriously? - I had my friends messaging me telling me, who are all these middle-class white folk protesting against gentrification? Am I the only one that can see the irony here? - Some of the organizers are black! - So what, black people can't be anti-black? Reclaim was a joke! - It wasn't a joke, there were all kinds of people there. Isn't that what it's about? Bringing people together. - No, no it's not. It's about stopping the social cleansing of working class people, so we're not overrun by these bougie elites. Now this is a serious point for your project. Yeah, it's working class people, especially working class black people who are suffering the most here. And if you aren't down with that, then you can never understand the full scale of the problem. So what's this project? - I don't know yet, I'm still researching. Is it some kind of film, yeah? - Ahmed, chill. - Nah, I just wanna know, innit. Is it some kind of media, right? - Something like that. - Something like that? Let me tell you something. Them kinda projects, they don't mean shit. Yeah, not to real people. - What, why the fuck are you banging? - Well, where were you? - Sorry! Sorry. How was your performance? It was fine, not much going on. You filming today? - Nah, I think I'm gonna take a break. - What do you mean? - Don't feel like doing it anymore. - Why? I saw the pills. - What pills? - In your bathroom. I know what you're going through. I've been there myself. Nina. If you ever wanna talk, you know I'm here for you. - I just need a break from it. - Nina, what does that even mean? - I'm tired of it and I need a break. - And I have to find out through Ayo that you need to take a break? - Do I have to notify you? - Yeah, I'd appreciate it when we've been working on it for so long. - You haven't been at the meetings with people like fucking Ahmed telling you, "Your work's shit, it doesn't mean anything." I'm tired so I'm taking a break. - Nina, you're gonna get people who are gonna through this shit at you, I mean, are you just gonna give up at the first hurdle? - Me, give up? That is fucking rich coming from you, Isha! - What do you mean by that? - How long since we last spoke? Before I told you I was coming here, how long has it been? - Yeah-- - Fucking months ago, Isha! Months ago. - And, why do you think I was? Was it me who was running round town with a bunch of fucking yuppies? - Then don't fucking blame it on me, "Oh, I was hanging out with whoever." No, Isha, you were not here for me! Your suicidal friend got too fucking much for you! Yeah, so just say it! - Fuck you, Nina. - Next time we should punch it out or something. - You'd get fucked up. No, really. - This is meant to be Brixton, this is meant to be where I'm from. Where are all these people coming from? Where you can't even walk the streets. It looks like I'm the stranger, how am I the stranger? Hey, I'm allowed where I want. - Listen, how many times do we have to go through this? - It's not about how many times. - Please. - How many times, listen man. You must be-- - Look, look, calm down. Can we just take a walk? - Why are you touching me, man? - Look, I don't wanna touch you, just step back please. - Let me come through. - You cannot come through. - Listen man. - You can't come through. - It's always you, it's always the ones like you isn't it? - I'm not gonna tell you again. - Fuck! All right, all right, all right! All right, all right! Stop, you're hurting him! - My arm, my arm! What you doing? - I'm fucking up, ah! My arm! Whoa, why my fucking arm, man? - Don't fidget. Just hold still. Hiya. I'll have that please. Thank you, I'll have a yellow one. Thanks. Thank you. - Send me your videos. I wanna create a space where people worldwide can post their stories and videos. - Like a network or something? - Well I think they can even discuss tactics. See how to combat it in their area. - Okay, but what does that do? - Well, it would bring people from not just London, but New York, Berlin, worldwide together on this. - Hi Nina. - Hey Nina. - Hi Nina. Gentrification in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn looks like skyrocketing rent rates. - First of all, rents in Harlem have gone up literally 200 %. - Berlin is known to be hip, chic, and multicultural, perfect recipe for gentrification. It starts off with young, broke artists like myself moving to the city. Of course this somewhat individual decision comes with a price for a local community, right? - With the increase of upper-middle class white people, particularly younger white folks who consider themselves artists, comes a great deal of infrastructure, one would say. So you have your shops, your boutiques, your coffee places, your restaurants. - Cultures that have taken over the world have been invented here literally. Hip-hop, in part, was born here. The black arts movement in part was born here. Jazz, in part, was born here. - But what's interesting is is that not everyone gets to take part in all of this quote/unquote progress. Some people get left behind. - If neighborhood's are not multi-class, and do not have class and racial diversity, they, urban culture will cease to flourish, and it literally will all become a kind of Manhattan mini-mall. - So gentrification looks a lot like uncertainty to us here in Bed-Stuy. - Once the public housing goes, Harlem goes. At that point, I don't know what to say. - What do you think? - Yeah, so we've got this group coming down next week Monday. - Okay - potentially interested in hiring out the venue. That's gonna be next Monday at around 6 p.m. - Monday. - They're gonna confirm that with me, but it'd be really cool, Di, if you could be down here as well. - Oh no, definitely, yeah I'll be there. Does anyone else want to come? Just extra support. So, can we move on to the fundraiser for the people of Cressingtons Legal Support? We've got Nina here, and she's offered to use some of her contacts in art and media to kind of push things along? Yeah. I think that would be really cool. - Yeah, I'm happy to organize something if you all agree. Yeah. - What I still feel like the money should come from us, really, I mean, I don't like relying on the media for anything. - Yeah, I agree with you, but it doesn't mean we can't use them. - Yeah, but it kinda sends out the wrong message. You know, they're a big part of the problem here. - Yeah, but so am I, right? I'm part of the problem. Me and the bougie elites? - Yeah. - But I'm here. And you can use me. - So on to the next event. Jima, Born Free. - Born Free. Last Friday of this month. - That's exciting. I wanna see you all there. Also, maybe you can come down and like, you know, say something. - Yeah, definitely. I'm definitely there. You, you should-- - Yeah, I'll speak up. - Yeah, he's got a lot to say. What we're doing, yeah. - Yeah, yeah okay, yeah. Bring on Ahmed. - How we doing? - Really, really good. I mean, better than I expected. - Really? - Yeah. A certain actor brought most of it. He brought my favorite piece. - Wow. Thanks, I really appreciate it. - It's a good cause. Anyway, who was that guy you was talking to earlier? - He's a friend. - Like a friend, friend? - Yeah. He's a friend. - Cool. So, if I was try to kiss you, he wouldn't appear out of thin air, and try and stop me? Oh, mate. - Ayo. - Mickey Roland. - Ayo's a local artist. And Mickey's-- - Oh, I know him. Mr Angel Fury. Thanks for gracing us all with your presence and helping us out with such a worthy cause. - Not a problem. It's my area too now, so-- - Oh, you live in Brixton? - Yeah, just moved in. - Really, where? 21 questions. - Huh. - Rushcroft Road. - Really, Rushcroft Road? - Yeah, it's great. - Yeah I know, I used to live there, until they kicked us out. Kicked a load of our mates out too. Well, enjoy your purchase, mate. See you about. - This is fucking pretentious. - You know nothing's going on there. - It's none of my business. - Well you should know. So your show tonight. - Let me guess, you didn't get it. - No, I got it. - Brixton! Yeah that's right, don't listen to me, I don't exist, it's just like, who is he, what is he? I ain't get a chance. I just had to carry on, I had to fight through it, 10 of them, 12, all 'cause of these bloods, not their bloods, my bloods. I remember them laughing, - Fuck you! - laughing in my face, spitting on me! Fuck me, fuck you! This is what, it's my life! This is what I have to live, this is what I have to fucking go through. That's what living is like. That's what my life's like, that's what I've had to go through. I gotta act like I'm not a human being. Just getting worried, I haven't seen him for days. - I mean, he's probably just doing his thing, I'm sure he'll turn up. By the time they got him to A &amp; E, he was gone. What do you wanna do? - I'm not sure. - I think it'll be a mistake if we cancel. People need to see what you've captured. Like, if you need a few more weeks here, Nigel's cool to give it to you. - No. No, tell him thanks, but this isn't my home. I'm just eating kale. I can see that. Why? Just what I do all day. After pilates and yoga and a little trip to Pret. We've lost that cohesiveness in Brixton because of, money, it's changing the character. What do you think was attracting people to Brixton? The transport links, the vibrant community, and all the rest. They're the real people, the people that are past of this community, are being forced out. What has been built here over the last century is so profound and has gone on to influence the world. We were a part of the riots, we're part of that story of the building up of Brixton. Not everyone gets to take part in all of this "progress." Some people get left behind. How do you know the people you're not talking to don't, or aren't effected by the same things that you are? I'm just hoping to discover that. Because it has so much memory, and it's quite painful. - Thank you all for coming. It's with great pleasure that I introduce today's artist. Nina Edwards. - Hi. I'd just like to get something off my chest before we go to questions. Some of you might recognize the face and sounds of Benjamin Williams, also known as Big Ben. For those of you who don't know, he recently passed away, so I'd like to take a minute's silence for him. Okay to carry on? Yeah. Okay. Do you ever think you'll move back to Brixton? I mean, properly. - So, questions.
