Dad's gonna be so happy to see you. I lost you, Josh. Somewhere along the way, I lost you. I don't know how. - It wasn't like this when Daddy was still around. - [ Groans ] I remember when your saying that used to make me feel guilty... and dissolve like a bowl of Jell-O. Well, you'd better find some new routines, champ, 'cause I got news for you.

And, Walker, try to find somethin' respectable to wear, will you? [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Thunderclap ] [ Sniffing ] - Karl, what are you doin'? - Um, the woman who, um, bought that Paper Warrior today, she, um, forgot her address book, so I was thinkin'... maybe I'd go down there and return it. How'd I get lucky enough to find you? That is a terrific gesture, Karl. It'd be a real pleasure. And you're all alone. No one to share the burden with. No one to curl up to at night, who'll hold you and make everything okay. - You should feel good about yourself. - I did until two minutes ago. You should expose yourself to social situations.

Look, it's no biggie, okay? Pretty tough, huh? So are you. Not me. Yeah, right. You're an outlaw. You're the toughest, smartest hacker alive. Look, Josh. That tax refund stunt... Sure, it felt great being an outlaw... for about a day. But I blew my whole career. See, guys like us, we have to be careful. Sometimes we're too smart for our own good. [ Man ] Because they've only been household accidents. [ Terry ] Accidents? That's insane! Someone or something is coming after my son and my friends. Terry. How many more people have to die before someone starts taking this seriously? [ Man ] As far as we're concerned, those have all been accidents. [ Terry ] He doesn't think there's a problem. Three people have died in the last week. What has to happen before you're willing to get involved? [ Man ] You're just getting... [ Terry ] Don't tell me to calm down! [ Man ] Terry. Terry. There's an order. Shit. These guys... Mom. I was just sitting down, and this is from your book. There's an order here. [ Terry ] Hurry up, and get everything unplugged. I know. It sounds crazy, but something is after me, and I'm not about to sit around debating how that could be. [ Bram ] Okay, you finish up here. I'm gonna go over to Datanet... and violate a few hundred federal statutes... by putting a trace on the hacker's next call. That'll give us the guy's number, and we'll nail the bastard. [ Gasps ] Not my curling iron. [ Beeping ] For the ring and the car. Ooh. So close. Oh, God. ♪ Who to blame ♪ ♪ I'm living with a stranger ♪ [ Sighs ] I'm waiting. I'm waiting. Okay. All the money in the world. [ Groans ] Oh, God. I'll be back in a few hours. Just gonna go downtown and see Bram. Okay. You keep an eye on Grandma, okay? Yeah. And don't let her plug anything in. Mm-hmm. And don't believe anything she tells you about me when I was a child. Oh, honey. [ Sighs ] See ya, Ma. Okay. [ Beeps ] [ Beeping ] [ Phone Rings ] [ Gasps ] - Hello. - [ Buzzing ] - All right. - [ Connection Static ] [ Beeping ] [ Beeping ] I'm waitin' for you, Mr. Hacker. Come on, come on. I know you're in there. [ Beeping ] Yes! 555-3371. Be there. Be there. You're hooked. We got ya. Be there. [ Rings ] That's impossible. [ Ringing Continues ] - [ Ringing ] - What the... [ Multiple Phones Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] - [ Beeping ] - Datanet? [ Ringing Continues ] [ Man ] Okay. Line five, you're on the air. [ Man #2 ] I'd like "Sit Tight Tonight" by the Serial Killers. [ Man #1 ] Is that for anyone special? [ Man #2 ] It's for Bram Walker, who I know is all alone right now. [ Beeping ] [ Phone Rings ] [ Gulps ] Yeah. [ Man #2 ] Sit tight tonight, Bram. Don't forget to scream. Pain makes me sing. [ Busy Signal ] Shit. [ Buzzing ] Oh, good. Go right! [ Tires Screeching ] [ Sighs ] [ Rings ] [ Grunting ] [ Horn Honks ] [ Beeping ] [ Humming ] [ Door Opens ] [ Woman On Police Radio ] Euclid and 39th, man down. Car 12, respond to car vandals, 1433 Main Street. [ Twittering ] Shit. We got an officer down. You're gonna have a hell of a first night on the force. - 1227 Lakeview Drive. - [ Engine Starts ] [ Woman On Police Radio ] Suspect has no name. [ Siren Wailing ] - [ Beeping ] - Hey, Mike. What do ya got? Domestic violence, Lakeview Drive. - We're gonna have to take it. - Here. Take this. Let's roll. [ Woman On Radio ] 6-10, hostage situation. [ Man On Radio ] 6-14, shots fired. - [ Woman ] 6-27, armed robbery. - [ Siren Wailing ] [ Man ] 6-11, break-in at 1227 Lakeview Drive. Holy shit. [ Woman ] Car 12, robbery in progress. [ Siren Wailing ] [ Helicopter Whirring ] [ Helicopter Whirring ] What we got here is a goddamn mess, and nobody knows what's going on. Suspects are armed and dangerous. It's a domestic dispute. Go easy. Jesus Christ. [ Gasps ] Grandma, have you seen what's going on outside? [ Man ] Ready? Over here. Listen, rookie. It's a whole new ball game since I.A. We don't play that sitting duck shit anymore. [ Man ] Come on, everybody. Take your positions. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Take your positions! Let's go! Let's go! [ Humming ] Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! [ Gunshots ] Hey. [ Dog Barking ] [ Machine Beeping ] You're gonna be fine, Mom. You're in shock. They just want to keep you overnight for some tests. Thank God the two of you are okay. [ Machine Beeping ] [ Thunderclap ] An MRI makes a record of all the electrical activity in a person's brain... and stores it in a computer. So when that storm caused that electrical surge, it actually shot the killer's scan... out of the hospital computer, straight into Datanet. You mean there's an exact impression of the killer inside of Datanet's computers? It's not just an impression now. I guess, if you're religious, you'd call it his soul. Man, that really freaks me out. So, if he's computer-based... I got it. We exorcise him, right? We get a priest, go down to Datanet, throw his soul into hell. No, what we do is we take... Wait. H-Hold on. How about... we send him back through the MRI and into his body? You stay here, and me and Bram will go drive a stake through his heart. Yeah, great. That's... That's great. Why can't we just delete him? When you delete something on a computer, it doesn't go away, Mom. It's still in there. You just can't find it anymore. Unfortunately, he's right. I could program... - Fridge magnets. - Fridge magnets? Josh, didn't you tell me not to put fridge magnets... next to your disks because they'd erase them? Yeah. Oh, come on. You can't erase a computer the size of Datanet with a fridge magnet. Too bad. He's right. But he's not. What? We just need a slightly bigger magnet. Ohio Tech. Josh, hand me that. Here. Thanks. So, how exactly is your virus gonna get the killer to Ohio Tech? Right now he's roving free through the system. He can jump into any network he wants to. Once I run my virus, this will eat up all the available memory, forcing him out of Datanet. I've only left one route open: into the particle accelerator. - [ Beeping ] - Excellent. I can't wait to ice this skeezer. So, the virus chases him into the particle accelerator, then what? We just push a button and erase him? The accelerator is one huge mother of a magnet. We ramp the magnetism up as far as it'll go. That'll pull him into the accelerator. No matter what he is, it'll smash his atoms into oblivion. Cool. You really think this is gonna work? [ Electronic Twittering ] [ Terry ] You make a habit of breaking into scientific facilities, Bram? More like a hobby. Wouldn't all these places have guards and stuff? No, this is only a particle accelerator. All they have to protect themselves from is drunk students. It's right up here. Dope! Whoa. Come on. Which part's the magnet? This tube is the accelerator, and all of it's a magnet. When we shoot him into these coils, we're gonna blow him into a billion bits of nothin'. Over here is the control booth. It's okay. Go on in. The walls in here are sealed. As long as we stay in the control booth, we're safe from the magnetic field. - [ Click ] - When we crank the accelerator, don't leave the booth. The magnetism can pull the fillings right out of your teeth. [ Electronic Twitter ] Great. [ Whirring ] - Throw all these toggle switches along here and these here. - Okay. [ Bram ] Great. It's kickin' in. We're ready for him. [ Beeping ] He's almost here. What's happening? I don't know. It's surging out of the system. Whoa! [ Neck Cracking ] [ Computerized Voice ] Excuse me. A little stiff. Caught a bitch of a virus. Josh, no. Aaah! [ Groans ] Bram, are you okay? Yeah. Shit. [ Bram ] Shit. He's shutting it down. [ Gasps ] Terry, what's your hurry? We have all the time in the world. Go help your mom. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna try to rewire this sucker. [ Karl ] I've been looking forward to killing you for so long, but I want to do it slowly, baby. I want to taste your pain. [ Coughs ] All right. We can fix this. Twist. Ow! [ Groans ] Damn. [ Karl ] I want to feel your ribs crack while I suck the breath from your lungs. Work, will ya? Damn! No power here. Patch in downstairs. [ Gasps ] No good deed goes unpunished, Terry. Nice try. [ Karl ] Don't try to fight with me, bitch. Enough playing around. You can't run. You can't hide. You can't win. Come on! [ Typing ] Yes! We're back in. The board is up. Oh! - Josh! - [ Panting ] - Come on. - Let me in. [ Bram ] Get back! Get back! Ma. All right. Terry, get off the grate. Terry, Josh. Stay there. I'll be right up, okay? [ Groaning, Yells ] [ Panting ] [ Klaxon Blaring ] [ Female Voice On P.A. ] Magnetic field overload. Evacuate to shielded areas immediately. Magnetic field overload. [ Gagging ] Evacuate to shielded areas immediately. Magnetic field overload. Evacuate to shielded areas immediately. [ Panting ] [ Klaxon Blaring ] [ Groans ] [ Beeping ] Come on. Come on. [ Gasps ] - You're next. - [ Panting ] [ Buzzing ] [ Panting ] [ Panting ] [ Computerized Growl ] [ Groaning Softly ] [ Josh ] Mom, help! Please! Please! No! No! Get your fucking hands off my son. Guess again. I'm dead already, Einstein. [ Laughing ] I wouldn't waste that last bullet. [ Wind Whistling ] Frankly, Terry, I'm sick of all this family values crap. [ Alarm Blaring ] [ Groaning ] [ Yelling ] [ Distorted Screaming ] [ Beeping ] Thanks. - Terry. - Hmm? Do me a favor? Anything. Turn off that damn machine. [ Beeping Continues ] [ Click ]
