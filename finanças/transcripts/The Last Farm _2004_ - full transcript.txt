You shouldn't call at mealtime... I thought you were brought up well enough to know that. Well, the wind is blowing from the West but it will shift tonight. J?n delivers the mail and groceries tomorrow. Well, the old people home is not a better place Just because of some fancy pictures in a pamphlet. No, she's not here. She's taking a nap. No, that doesn't mean that she's feeling sick at all. In fact, she's feeling much better now; fine as a fiddle. Well, there's one or two things to do before we leave. That's up to you, Lilja. I'd prefer if you wouldn't come Until the weekend is over. Listen, is little Birta near the phone? Somewhere with daddy, I see. I'll tell her that. And give my regards to everyone. Let's just make this clear: You will not arrive until the weekend is over, right? Yes, dear. Bye, bye. Nice weather! So, this is the last time I deliver goods to you and Gr?a. Are you boarding up the windows? - Does it look like it? I'm preparing for the winter too. I've boarded up the windows Of the sheds and caught the Iast two stray sheep. I suppose they thought they escape the slaughterhouse. You and Gr?a are sure moving into the lap of luxuary... I want to ask you a little favor. ...Must be nice moving somewhere where there's always people... Could you post this letter to my Lilja? - No problem. Will it arrive before the weekend? - I suppose so. Say, has Gr?a got a fresh cup of coffee? - What? Has Gr?a got a cup of coffee? Co_ee? Well, actually I'm too... busy to drink coffee right now. Come on, just one cup? - No. Also, Gr?a is taking a nap. Oh well. Are we there yet? - Soon, dear. How soon? - In an hour or so. Do you want something to drink? I'm calling mom and dad to let them know that we're coming. The radio has gone dead so how do you suppose A mobile phone will work? Mom will be upset if we arrive unexpectedly. Besides, I think Dad will be pleased to know That somebody is helping him with the bags. WRITTTEN AND DIRECTED BY: PRODUCERS : TRANSLLATION BY GUNNAR ?ORRI PjTURSSON
