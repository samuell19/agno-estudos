Uh, excuse me, Mr. Smith? Oh, yeah. Hey, guys, that was a great show. - Thank you. - Hey, I got a little something for you. - There you go. - Thank you. How much did we make? - Oh. - A gift certificate? I could go for some Mexican. Uh, hey, Mr. Smith? Yeah. Can I help you? Um, yeah, so we were told that we were gonna be compensated for the show. Well, yeah. Got that free coupon and, you know, the hotel room. Right? Mm... We just were hoping for... monetary compensation. Well, Dave, we... We're a not-for-profit. There's no cash in the budget. What about, um, all the money raised from the run? Well, that goes to our cause. Right? I mean, you guys are compensated by your exposure. Mr. Smith, I'm sorry, no offense, but we just played for four hours. That's, um, less than two dollars an hour for each of us. Yeah. Well, okay. Just a second. I don't normally do this, you know, but, you know, that's a donation. So here, let me get something from my wallet for you here. Hold on one second. One second... Just one second. Just got... Oh, there it is. Here you go. Ten cents off a gallon of gas. At least these are good. I'm glad, 'cause those two bites are worth a half hour of work each. You think that the bank will let us deposit the gas coupon? See, that's the other thing. Joe, this van gets terrible gas mileage. We have to get rid of it. No. Hey, don't talk about her like that.

Sorry, I can't see a thing. Who are you? Dave Pearson. Oh. - I didn't recognize you with the makeup. - Makeup. Right. Um... I haven't seen you since graduation. - How-how ya doin'? - Good. Good. Uh... you were really... good. Yeah, like the best. - I didn't know you were in a band. - Amie, we are late for curfew. Uh... I guess we're going now. Bye. Thanks for coming, man. That's my brother. Who's the other one? I can't believe Dave just saw me perform. I know... Wait, that's the Dave that you used to be close with, right? Weren't you, like, trying to convince him to not do music? - Yes. - Guess he didn't listen. Obviously, you didn't either. Good thing, too. Can we just go, please? I guess we're going. Again. Is this it? It's the right address. I don't know about this. Um... We could sleep in the van. - Maybe they have breakfast. - - Danny. So, we don't have a TV. Living the dream. - Yep. - Yeah. - Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. - What? I'm-I'm sorry about earlier. Oh, no, that's... It's all good. I guess the, um... the silver lining of playing for tacos and... staying in grungy motels in the middle of nowhere is, um... you get to see the stars. Amie, you were so... Like, you never spoke in class, and all of a sudden, you're this rock star. Why does that make you smiley? 'Cause that's great... I mean, when did that happen? Um, like two years ago. Two years? Seriously? Yeah, Charlie convinced me, I... So, then, Mr. Boyfriend knew, huh? No. He didn't. Really? Yeah, he would have made my life miserable. Telling you your dreams aren't worth it and maybe you shouldn't follow your passion? - Can we not talk about ex-boyfriends... - Yeah, yeah. - Girlfriends, any of that... - We don't have to... Yeah. What do you want to talk about? Um... What's your favorite classic movie? Whoa. Okay. Uh... Oh! Jurassic Park. A hundred percent, Jurassic Park. The old one, right? - What? - The old one. There's a new one? - Yes. - No. - You haven't seen it? - No! - It's pretty good. - No, it's not. - Yes, it is. - No, it's not. - Yes, it is. - No, it's not. - No. - Oh, okay. All right. Speaking of which, - have you seen our van? - Yes, I have. - You've seen this van? - Yes, I saw it in the parking lot. - But have you seen it with the new decal? - Wow. No, I have not seen this. Whose is this? - Uh, that's Joe's. - Classic. - What do you mean, "classic"? - It just would be Joe's. I don't know. Could be mine. So are you living in a single, too? No. We've got a double queen in the room. We're literally sleeping in the same bed. No. No. I actually woke up with Joe's... You don't wanna... On my face. - So, I... - Do you remember? Do you remember? Do you? Yes. Of course. Yeah. See? - You had it. - Still got it. Well, on that note, sweet dreams. See ya. Now who's late for curfew? - Tell us everything. - Everything. Um... I don't know. That bed was terrible. Between your elbows in my face, and the broken spring... Cockroaches? We should've slept in the van. Guys, I can't believe how well that show went. I know, but that motel sucked. I mean, at least they had mints, right? Lucy, I don't think that's a mint. Oh, my... What is that ridiculous smile on your face? Me? What? Considering where we just stayed the night, you're looking awfully smiley. - I smell like an ashtray. - Me, too. - Why didn't you shower? - I did shower. - You showered in there? - It was not that bad. Okay, you were barely there. No, I just... I couldn't... I couldn't sleep, so I just went out and got some fresh air. Oh, so that's her name? What? Amie? I knew it. I knew it. Oh, look at you. If he hurts you, I will destroy him. We will destroy him. Got it? Bye. Hey, honey. How are you? - I'm good. - Are you tired? Oh, yeah. - Oh, hi. - Look at him. He missed you. Him sad. So, how was it? Tell me all about it. - It was really good. - Was it fun? - It was really, really good. - It was a good time? - We played for four hours. - Four hours. - Yeah. - That's a long time to play, isn't it? - Yeah. - Wow. Everybody was, like, jogging at first, not really paying attention, but then, like, nearing the end, like, people really started paying attention and, like, dancing and, like, going up to the stage and like... I don't know, I thought I saw some people singing along... They're like your fans. No, I mean, we have people who like our music. - Your band has fans. - No, we don't have fans. - You do. I'm your fan. - You're my mom. - I'm your fan. - You're my mom. I know. How did the other boys like it? Joe, actually, was really good this time. - Joe plays drums. - Yeah. Joe's the drummer. Danny plays guitar. No. Danny plays bass. I'm guitar. They're guitars. They're both guitars to me. - Um, how was the hotel? - Nasty. It wasn't even a hotel. It was like a motel. - Really? - Like-like... I mean, that's how we got paid. That and tacos. I'm sorry. It won't always be nasty motels and tacos. I promise you. Is this your, uh, dirty laundry? Yeah. Take it to the laundry room instead of here on the counter. Yes. Sorry. Oh... Look at you guys Clark Kenting it. You really just gotta own it. I do, just... not in front of Amie's mom. Yeah, well, with me, she gets what she gets. Besides, your mom loves me. She does love me, right? Yeah. All right. Let's go. Do not say a word. I'm home. - Hi. - Hey, Mom. Hi, Nikki. So, how was the college visit? Went really well. It was good. Oh, I wanted to remind you to bake the cupcakes for the bake sale. - Yes. Yeah. - It's just that the volunteer hours are so important for the scholarship applications. Yes. Um, thank you. Right, Lucy? Yeah. College is... It's-it's so important. Yeah. It is. Charlie, I didn't know you were back already. Yeah, I came in a day early. Um, we're gonna go to my room, but I love you. - Good to see you. - Bye. - Hey. - Hey. Hi. So, uh, any idea what time it is? No, but I know I'm early. - It's 12:30. - Whoa! Geez. You're the only person I know who can be late from the parking lot. Yeah. It's a gift, really. Hmm. So... Oh, yeah! Okay. You got it. Yep. What about your... It's okay. I can do this. Okay. Oh! That's interesting. Hi, uh, welcome to Cinema 10. How can I help you? Okay. I've got table six, large supreme, hold the pep. Table six, large supreme, hold the pep. You got it. Coming right up. I'm sorry. - Tonya, I'm sorry... - It's Taylor. Taylor, right, uh... Taylor, sorry. - Um... - It's okay. I just... ooh, had a late night. Nice of you to join us. Where were you? I didn't realize it would be this busy on a Tuesday. Didn't you get Dad's text? The tournaments are in town. You're late. Hey, Sparky, you got that pie for table three for me yet? What'd you just call me? New nickname thing I'm trying out. I don't know if you know what the Color Dash 5K is, - but it's like this huge... - Dave. - Yes. - Stop wasting your time. - Ooh, Peppy Joe. Lana, Sam... - No. What about Nitro? - Why? - 'Cause your kinda cool and smooth. Oh, okay. Okay. I like that one. Can't pay your rent on tacos. Dude. Look at my best friends waiting for me. I thought you were at the mechanic. Did that just backfire? Are we gonna practice or what? Shotgun! What's the first thing on the agenda? Our paperwork was received at Battle of the Bands. - Thank you. - Yes. Also, the girls are competing. We're not taking it easy on them. What? No. Nobody said that. That's not what I'm worried about. What are you worried about? Half Past Midnight. Yeah, they're competing. What? Half Past Midnight cannot play at Battle of the Bands. - That's unfair. - I know. They've won the last three years in a row. If we don't step up our game, that's gonna be... I'm not scared of them. We've worked way too hard for them to beat us. Whoa. Okay. Where did this Danny come from? Man, I'm done scooping ice cream! You know if I quit, we don't get free pizza, right? - That's like all we eat. - Yeah, but if we win, then we can afford pizza. - I second that idea. All right. - We have to kill it. We have to make sure we get a spot on The Warped Tour. You know what? I second that, too. Do we have a third? - We have a third. - All right. We've all hit me. Second: mail. Mail. Give me a record deal. "We regret to inform you..." I want an agent. No, this is life insurance. "You need to work on your charisma." "Dear Summertime Dropouts, you're not good enough." You know what, we'll just... We'll just build our stage on rejection letters. That's what we'll do. They can tell us no as many times as they want to, but we're not giving up. - Hey, Joe. - Yeah. Do your magical free pizza powers apply to delivery? Of course. Guys! That was a moment. Like... "They're not gonna tell us no." Song. Like... band. We get together. We play songs...

You know, the only shame is that you won't be there to see when all the kids' teeth turn black. I didn't think about that. - Um, no, Charlie, no. - This is Charlie. Excuse me, I'm sorry. Can you just... Hi, Charlie. Um, sorry, I thought this was Amie's phone. It is. Hi. Hey, uh, so, did you guys hear? Hear what? They're canceling The Warped Tour. So this is the last chance we're gonna have to play on The Warped Tour. - Can I help you with that pink glitter? - Yes, please. - Awesome. - Please do. You know, the-the warped zoo. Hello?

This year's winner of The Battle of the Bands: Warped Tour Edition is... For the fourth time in a row, Half Past Midnight! Give it up for 'em. Come on up here. All right! Nice work, guys. Nice work. Go ahead and give 'em a bow. We'll see you at Warped Tour! Yeah! Give it up! You guys were awesome. Yeah, you were too. You were really, really good. I, uh, I liked your song. Yeah, it was super subtle. Actually, Danny's the one who came up with the pink guitar line, so... - Oh, really? - Yeah, I've always wanted one. You can borrow mine whenever you want. You should've called it "We'll work for tacos." Wouldn't be lying. Um, how about we go get some pizza? A slice or two? Um, I have an interview in the morning. I should probably get some sleep. Yeah, I don't know. I'm kinda tired. - I just wanna go home. - Oh, hey, hey, hey. - Didn't I say to break this up? Let's go. - Yeah, sorry. - Sorry. - Let's go, out. - We're going. - I know you guys have a date. Let's go, keep on. - Charlie, you have my keys? - - Yes. - Uh, hey, Amie? - You're a winner. - Um... - Yeah? Sorry, can I just talk to you for a second, just real quick? - Sure. - I have to get back, too. - Um, uh... - What? I was just... wondering if maybe you wanted to go out just the two of us? Um, I... Uh, I don't know. I just... I can't. - I'm sorry. - Okay, no, that's... - Maybe another time, though. - Yeah. - Hey, you're a winner. - Thank you. It's okay. You're a winner in my book. - Appreciate it. - Have a good night. I know I should be sad... but, Charlie... Yeah. You know, it's probably not a good idea for you guys to date members of a competing band. Don't be silly. There's gum on my bucket. You guys dare me to eat it? - No. - No. Fine, I dare myself. They don't call me "Double Dog Dan" for nothing. - Nobody calls you "Double Dog Dan." - No one calls you that. Guys, all great bands have been rejected at some point. It's like a rite of passage. Yeah, I get it, but we didn't get in. I just... I don't think that's such a big deal. I think we can still play small shows around here. We don't have to give up. Yes, we can play small shows and build our fan base. Yes, exactly. Guys, we gave it our best shot and that wasn't enough. Okay, but Warped Tour was never the end goal. Like, yes, of course it would've been nice, - but we don't need it. - Yeah, I don't think we do. So, that song... Who could possibly be the full-time cutie? - Hey, Joe? - Yeah? How much gas do we have left? - Enough, why? - That was our exit. "Vans Warped Tour." Is that like the shoes? Vans shoes? Why is it "warped"? - That's what I wanna know. - Vans, they must be... I also wanna know what time it is. Where is he? Hey, speak of the devil! - Hey, congratulations. - Congratulations. We got tickets. We got tickets. Do you have three so I can go with you? - What? What happened? - What? What? We, um... We didn't get it. Well, there's next year. No, this was the last Warped Tour, so... It's the last tour ever? I mean, come on. It's not, like, about the tour. It's just... it's just that they didn't want us. I feel like I have the best band in the world... - and nobody cares. - Honey... you can't tell me that there won't be other venues and other tours to play on. Your opportunities are only limited by your hard work and your will. Right? Come on. Knuckle it up. Come on, knuckles. Dad, it's really weird when you do it. No, no, it's not. Hey, how'd the battle go last night? Do I need to find your replacement? Didn't make it. Told you. Look, Danny, I'm sorry I came down on you so hard. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I know you're really bummed 'cause things didn't work out for you, but... maybe it's time to... be realistic. Not everyone can be an artist. There are gonna be a lot more opportunities, Dad. Hey. You guys really killed it. Yeah, yeah, we did. Sorry you didn't make it. No, it's fine. We're, um... We're getting back on track. It's... it's gonna be fine. Hey, I mean, worst case scenario, you can always work at Nick's. I already work at Nick's. Yeah. You're gonna make it. Hey, I was doing some research. Uh, we're so close to Minneapolis, we should play at The Garage. Anybody who's anybody goes through there. - Okay, that sounds good. - How soon can we book it? Also, do you have any fruit snacks? I got pretzels, these cheese things, - and marshmallows. - Marshmallows. Good choice. Pretty soon, I'm just waiting to hear back from them. He loves to make you wait. ♪ I'm not sorry ♪ ♪ I'm not sorry ♪ Oh, wow. Oh, look what the cat dragged in. You live here? Yeah. What's up, weirdos? Uh, we're just doing some official band stuff around the neighborhood and so... Yeah, merch, building our brand. Super professional. Getting a huge SD on our wall as well. Oh, sounds major. Do you guys wanna take a break from your band business? - Official... - Sorry, official. No, we'll like... We won't bother you guys. - I mean, I could use a break. - Same. Oh, I mean, yeah, we could totally grab some food. Yeah, I could eat. Did you guys know that cats only meow to mimic humans? - Danny. - Danny. Ew. Yeah, uh, is that street legal? Yeah, it's street legal. Don't worry about that. That's all the usual stuff. I am so impressed. It smells like high-grade diesel. I wish it was high-grade diesel. Thank you. Um, no, I mean, like... 'Cause if you're asking about my life plans... No, I wanna know, like, college or are you staying here? Well, you know, I actually have it all planned out. - Who made your t-shirts? - Oh, I did. I was taking this online graphics course, - and I've gotten pretty good at it. - What? Really good? More like really awesome. - Uh, thank you. - Yeah. - Uh, awesome. - Hey, so, you just moved here? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - I'm from St. Paul. - Okay. Yeah, I convinced my dad to get a job here. I think... I don't know, I think we could do something. And I don't know if I'm ever gonna meet these guys again. And so, like, you live across the street from Dave? - Mm-hmm. - I'm there, like, all the time. Cool. Like, in college, you know, I could keep up music, sure, - but I don't know if I'd ever... - Yeah, I don't know. I think maybe that's not a bad idea. You know, we wanna start printing shirts soon. You should totally design our graphic. The guys would love that. - Oh, my God, I'd love to. - Really? - I'd be honored, yeah. - Yeah! Friendship. - From my grandfather. - Really? Yeah. - I think right now... - Guys, guys! - We made the cover! - What? - Look! - Wait, let me see this. - You look awesome! - Ooh, that's us! Wait, wait, wait. "Danny Green, Dave Pearson, and Joe Seifus take time..." Does it say my name? Look at your cute little face. - Take this. - Yeah, yeah, no, no. - Take that. - We have to take this. - Put it in the van. - God, that's sick! Guys... My mom is literally gonna kill me. You coming? Uh, yeah. Hi. You skipped our Iowa State trip. No, I... I went. - You did? - Mm-hmm. I played a show on the way back. So you toured the classrooms? And you ate lunch in the cafeteria? I saw the outside. So you buzzed through the parking lot, and you staged a photo so that you could lie to me? I wasn't lying. Why? 'Cause if I told you, you would... - Because I would say no! - Yeah. Because we planned this. Because we've... we planned this. I know. Mom, I-I know we planned this. I know that. But this... this is what I wanna do. And I'm really good at it. You're acting like you haven't lied before. This isn't about me. And I would not lie to you. It's been you and me, and that means something to me. - And I thought I could count on that. - You can. Okay, um... So you're a musician. I mean, like, you're a famous musician, like, you've made it. But... the only thing you can play... is covers of commercial jingles. - No, no. - No? Yes. - What? Seriously? - I mean, okay. So you can tell the truth all the time, - but nobody believes you. - No, that sucks. - I can't do that. - Yes. Are you just saying yes to everything? No, that's my everyday life. And I love commercial jingles, they're super catchy. But more importantly, if you were given a trough of ice cream on your birthday, but the only thing you could do is bathe in it, would you be happy or sad? - Hi. - Hi. Um, is Amie home? She hasn't responded to us. Yep, she's in her room. Great. I can't keep lying to my mom. It's just the two of us and she's depending on me. So... you're gonna let your mom crush our dream? - No, no, no, let me talk to her... - No, Charlie, stay out of it. Lucy, do you have anything to say about this? Cool, am I the only one here - who cares at all about this band? - Are you kidding me? I wouldn't be lying to my mom for this long if I didn't care. I just can't keep doing this to her. "Doing this to her"? I'm sorry, when has she ever put you first? Seriously? Lucy, what's up? Why are you being so quiet? I got an internship. What? You're kidding. My interview was the day after Battle of the Bands. What if we made Warped Tour? I told my parents that, if we made Warped Tour, that I'd cancel the internship. But the deal was, if we didn't, then I'd take it. And-and you just... You forgot to tell us? I thought we were gonna go on tour. I thought it was gonna be great and nothing would interfere. Guys, I really thought we were gonna make it. Wow. When are you leaving? Tomorrow. Guys, I didn't mean to hurt you. You guys know my family moved here for you, right? For the band? You don't even care? Can you stop thinking about yourself for one second? You're not even listening to us. - I can't believe you guys. - Charlie, come on. Charlie! Hey, Charlie. Charlie, hey. - Hey, you good? - I'm fine. Okay, what's going on? You are the last person in the world I would talk to about this! Hey, there, stranger. Hey! What are you doing here? I could really go for a scoop of strawberry ice cream. Oh, you got it. How you gonna pay for this? What? No way! All yours. Lucy, this is amazing. Yeah, I got the lightning bolt in there. Wow. Is that a birthday Husky? Oh, yeah. Awesome! Do you want my advice? - No. - Okay. But what is it? Your mom is your mom, like, that's just... It's really tough, but... they're your band. You know, like, they're your friends and... I don't know, I think you gotta talk to them. I did. Right, I know you did, but... I mean, to be honest, I-I saw Charlie after you talked to them, and I think you need to talk to them again, because... They're not gonna listen. - What do you mean? - They don't get it that... - Okay, but you can... - They're not listening. - I-I'm listening. - No, you're not. You're trying to fix it. And I don't need you to fix it. I need you to listen to me. I'm trying, okay? I know. I really appreciate you trying. I just can't have this conversation. I'm sorry. I don't think Amie understands. Like, yes, we wrote all the songs together, and we've always performed together as a band, but, like, without her, there is no band. She's literally the lead singer. I mean, am I crazy? I feel crazy. You would tell me if I'm being crazy, right? I mean, but they are your friends. I know. I know, I know they're my friends, but... Look, you'll figure it out. Just give them some space, give yourself some space and... Is that your lady friend? I'm hoping you're my lady friend. - You have, um, you have... - What? - I got it. - Oh. Oh, there it is. Make a wish. - What did you wish for? - It's a secret. Cool. Cool. So, I'll-I'll see you later. Yeah. Sweet. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Bye. - Hi. - Hey, there. I honestly thought you guys were gonna let me go without saying goodbye. No. I'm still mad at you, but I wouldn't do that. I'm so proud of our little baby. All grown up. Are we good? Maybe. Come here. I can't believe Lucy made this. This is ridiculous. Oh, my. Huh, huh. What in the world are you boys up to? We're trying to make shirts. Oh. Sweetie, what is that design supposed to be?

We thought we'd just have a little sit down with y'all. We know how much the show meant to all of you. And with it coming up, there's probably not a chance you're gonna get on that stage. It's really too bad, too. I mean, those Warped Tour people are never gonna see what they're missing out on. Or will they? What are you talking about? Yeah, what do you mean? If you can't get on the Warped Tour stage... build your own. Wait, I'm liking where you're going. Yeah, well, I have this client who has a very big parking space that happens to be right across from where the Warped Tour plays. Pretty sure I can get them to sponsor you. We'd bring the Summertime to them. We would play there, and then everyone who was walking by would have to... - walk by us. - Yes, I love it! Wait, that's brilliant. Warped Tour, here we come. Anybody gonna eat that? - No, Danny, it's all yours... - Yes, I was... - I was going to. - - Oh, well, I gave it to Danny. What do you think? What do you think of that? If it's like a... - Right? - It's okay, but it should go up on the second riff. Play it. Yeah. - That's good. - Yeah, that's better. - Yeah. - That is good. It's better than what you wrote. True. Why don't you play with us? Like, as a part of Summertime? Yeah, you should. Okay, we all know they should, so is it a yes or no? Amie? Could you come sit? What's up? I've been thinking a lot about what you said. And I... I... I wanted to show you this. What is this? - You were in a band? - I was. Why haven't you told me this? It's a... different life. When I was your age, I met this really great guy, and we played music and we were good. And a promoter heard us and we started touring. It was like this great adventure, and then it ended. What happened? Well, we had you. So I ruined your career? No. No, you were the best thing that I got out of my career. But the industry's really hard. And I watched it... really chew up a lot of my friends. It's a hard life and I wanted something better than that for you. And I want you to be happy. But I am. I'm really happy. Your father gave me that our first paid gig. - This? - Yeah. - Can I borrow it? - You can have it. We have a show coming up. I really want you to be there. - Mom. - Oh, hey, hun. Hey, what's up? We're about to perform. I know. It's so exciting. What are you doing? Um, just getting the word out about the show online. - Ooh, smart. - Yep. - I already have 36 retweets. - Oh, oh. We know all the real bands have merch. This is so cool. No, no, they're not. But these? These are cool. What? No, Dad, come on. Are you serious? Yes, yes. How did you... How did you do this?
