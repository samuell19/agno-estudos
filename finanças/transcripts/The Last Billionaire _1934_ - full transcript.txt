THE LAST BILLIONAIRE Played by Cast in order of appearance: The kingdom of Casinario, founded in the Fourth Century by European colonialists not among the Great Powers. The country consists of one city, the sole territory of the kingdom. But it is a city of the future. The number of tourists that disembark in the port of Casinario increase the fortunes of its inhabitants. In other words, the citizens of Casinario either work as functionaries or sit all day under its palm trees. Alita ensures the exceptional treatment of its visitors, for they know that hospitality determines their country's wealth. Recently, the parliament examined a grave problem: There was too much money in the treasury. The head of parliament decided that the taxes of all functionaries should be reduced. The Prime Minister stood on the balcony of the Royal Palace, announcing the good news to the people. The Queen, uniting and ensuring the happiness of the people, was acclaimed by her subjects. Casinario's only beggar thrives on the prosperity of the country. This prosperity is due to its celebrated casino. Every season visitors flock from Europe and America. In this room immense fortunes are made and lost around the gambling table. Thanks to this table, the prosperity of Casinario will never end. But Casinario must grow. Its government is determined to build the most beautiful city in the world. Work will begin soon. And here we see the Queen, surrounded by the royal family, examining the model for the Casinario of the future. For the realization of the project, the Queen makes an appeal to all Casinarians living abroad, in order to raise the 300 million required to launch the project. Prince Adolph, heir to the crown, joins his mother encouraging the cooperation of Casinarians living abroad. Even the granddaughter of the Queen, daughter of Prince Adolph, smiling here, encourages patriots living abroad to prove their love. Are there many Casinarians like me who live abroad? I don't know of any but you, Mr. Banco. Oh...it's me. It's with great pride that Casinario thinks of you, its only child living outside its borders. Who has become immensely famous. As the richest man in the world. Yes, yes. The last billionaire, considering your fortune. So you need 300 million. - Yes, 300 million... Very well. I understand. It's said that Casinario... - Excuse me. I will not forget that Casinario is my birthplace. We are in agreement. I will give you the sum. Here is a gift which we hope will please you. It was sent by the Queen. Are you sleeping, Mr. Brown? No, I'm not sleeping. I was thinking. Mr. Brown, the famous detective attached to my person. His Excellency, the ambassador of Casinario. Are you exiting by this door, Mr. Banco? - Yes. Then wait a moment. Something new has happened. He woke this morning at 6:00, as always, He ate hard-boiled eggs... How many? Two. He signed checks destined for charitable organizations, and Mr. Banco at that moment, had... Mr. Banco is coming! - Excuse me. Who was this gentleman with Mr. Banco? Mr. Banco is in conference with the Casinarian ambassader. - Aha! - Why "aha"? Mr. Banco was born in Casinario. He hasn't visited in 50 years... but has remained in excellent relations with his homeland. Mr. Banco is single, isn't he? Everyone knows this. Princess Isabelle of Casinario is 20 years old, isn't she? I wouldn't know the age of the princess, why would you ask? There is no talk of marriage? There is no talk of marriage, I know nothing about it. Aren't there rumors in Casinario regarding this subject? I know nothing, so I say nothing! Mr. Banco, Her Majesty the Queen has allowed me... to offer you this portrait of Princess Isabelle. Because Her Majesty approves the project we have initiated, with Casinario's most celebrated son, very soon to be joined with the glorious family headed by our dear leader. Yes. Yes... But that won't do! That's not enough. Not a cent! The business you're proposing would be difficult for me. Charming. And seeing that we agree, we mustn't lose time. I'll leave for Casinario in a month. The wedding will take place soon afterward. I shall give the money and the jewels after the ceremony. Could we not receive the money sooner? Not a cent. I said money and jewels after the ceremony. Very well, very well. And now the phone call... Hello? I asked for Casinario! Yes, Casinario! The Royal Palace. Hello? Hello? Casinario? Hello? Royal Palace? Death! Death! Death! Death! If I see you just one more time without your tie, I'll toss you out! I can afford a tie when I get paid. What an era, gentlemen! A mob gathers in front of the palace, and the valets no longer wear ties! Hello? We're waiting for Her Majesty. No. She's not here. Is it an emergency? What? Yes, I'm cutting you off! I've had enough! I haven't been paid in six months, I won't work anymore! I'll reconnect them when I get paid. - Bravo! Miss, I beg you. It's the Royal Palace. It's for the Queen! The Queen! The Queen! Then let the Queen pay me! Gentlemen, the Queen! Isabelle! It's incredible! At a moment that you're representing your country, You refuse to marry? - No, I want to marry... but I refuse to marry this man! - Why? He's so old! He's my age! - That's it exactly... - Stop! You'll learn to respect the elderly! So. What do you have to say? Speak! What's this racket! They're demonstrating, Madam. What about? Money. We don't have any! All the same...Announce me. To see royalty on the balcony will calm them. You don't know how to talk to the people? At this moment it won't do any good. So. Call the police! I must inform Your Majesty that the police refuse to work without being paid. Without being paid? Money again? It's scandalous! And the parliament? How's the Minister? It's a financial question, naturally! What does the Prime Minister say? Say something. What does the Prime Minister say? The Prime Minister...is speaking! The government realizes the gravity of the situation: The casino must close for lack of funds. The money has completely disappeared! No citizen must suffer unduly this historic lack of currency! So it is necessary to have your approval of the proceedings. Very good! I demand the floor! Later! You refuse me the right to speak? I appeal to my colleagues! The way of truth is being stifled! Gentlemen! Defend your sacred vows! Be quiet! I appeal to my friends. You discredit... Won't we save our country? Don't we have any solutions? I know my duty. Your Majesty, I should... You don't know me. Isabelle! Your father will never be king. Your mother will never be queen... And you are free. I shall abdicate. No! Bravo! But, Your Majesty! I shall sacrifice myself to calm the people. It's fabulous. Grandmother is abdicating! I won't have to marry the old man! I will address for the final time my people to announce my irrevocable decision. Open the doors. Open the doors! Do something! Residents of Casinario, painful circumstances we are experiencing, compell me to make a grave decision for the good of the state. Banco called. We're saved! This decision... you'll know very soon! Yes, yes, naturally! Hello? Well? Banco is giving us 300 million! He's coming in a month! Bravo! Run and tell the Prime Minister! We've got the money! We're saved! Yes, of course the wedding must be celebrated first of all! Give me the phone. I must talk to Mr. Banco. Give the phone to Mr. Banco. Her Majesty wishes to speak to him. Mr. Banco, Her Majesty wishes to speak to you! Mr. Banco? Her Majesty will speak to you now. Hello, Mr. Banco? Her Majesty. Your Majesty, you do me great honor! Her Majesty? Go answer Her Majesty! There, I cut them off! I don't hear anything! I'm very happy to... That's right, the functionaries haven't been paid for six months. The casino is closed. There's not a cent left. Very good. I understand. Could you give me some details? You could give a loan to Her Majesty! Oh yes...Oh yes. Her Majesty can't hear anything. The line was cut off. That doesn't matter. they get married, he gives the money... all will be resolved. The building projects? They'll never happen! With what money? With all they owe us? It's a scam! Yes!... I am the servant of Your Majesty. So Mr. Banco, are you pleased? Yes! Very pleased. One week after the wedding, they will get their money. Is Your Majesty satisfied? Very satisfied! Very satisfied! He'll give us the money first thing. We should perhaps give the good news to Princess Isabelle? You may go tell her. I'll be there presently. What news? My child, I will remain queen, Your father will rule after my death, your mother will be queen, and in a month you will marry the richest man in the world. Oh! All is lost! The wedding day has been set! Good! Where are you going? To the casino! I'm going to bet everything I have. If I win, we'll elope tonight! The state is saved. In several days the national accounts will be in balance. All functionaries will be paid. Credit will be unlimited, for which the citizens can thank Mr. Banco. Mr. Banco will soon come to the aid of his homeland. Very good! Mr. Banco will deposit in the treasury an immense sum... to pay our present debts, but also to be drawn by us... the gross pay due! Place your bets... Bets are placed...Bets are closed Place your bets... Bets are made... Bets are closed. Place your bets! The bets are placed. The bets are closed. 16 red, even, and lose. To him, the grey shoes. - Here! You win the cigarette case. Gentlemen, place your bets. This will be over soon. The money will return. In a month, the state will be rich. - Let's hope so. 5 red, even and lose. Gentlemen, place your bets. The bets are placed... - Put that down, sir! Bets are closed. 12 red, even, and lose.

Bring that back in a month, and you'll get your money. You promise? That fixes nothing. The government isn't being properly financed. That makes two chicks... and one egg.

Are you going to give some money now? But my friend, I don't have any! You don't have any money? So you go back on your promise! What does this man want? Let us speak! What do you want? I'm asking for alms, and he said he doesn't have money! All the same he promised that when Banco arrived, he'd pay me! He's mad! Bring him, bring him! Could you sign this, Mr. Banco? Thank you.

There's not a cent to be had! All is lost. Now that there's no money, he's going to pay for everything. I hope Mr. Banco, that you won't believe him! It's all right, it's all right. I understand. Will you leave us, you rascal? What you're saying, it's in your interest, isn't it? As for me, I've got nothing to lose now! It's ridiculous! He's a crazy man. Mr. Banco, allow me to explain... It's pointless. I already know. This is difficult business. Mr. Banco... The crowd is asking for you! Later, gentlemen. Speak, Mr. Banco. Say a few words to them. People of Casinario, the heart that you show, touches me deeply. I thank you. Would you like to come inside, Mr. Banco? One moment. Your interests will be linked with mine from now on. The Queen has generously offered me the post of General... Administrator, with all powers. I thank you. I perfectly understand the situation in the kingdom. This is why I do not cease to undertake the direction of the State. I would not wish to undertake anything without your approval. So have faith! Will you accept my authority? Yes! So, long live the Queen... and long live Casinario! We're listening, sir! Gentlemen, tomorrow morning at 9:00, we will start our work. Sir... Very good! Tomorrow morning, gentleman! - Sir... - Madam. You're a man of action, Mr. Banco. I like that. Govern Casinario as you please! No I don't want to marry him! I don't want to! Why are you making this so difficult? You are obliged to marry. And marriage isn't so serious! Adolph! What is that little idiot doing? Ah, nothing! You see it over there? The statue of Love! Or you could call it the sculpture of Casinario. If that old idiot falls in love with her, it might still work out. As you wish, as you wish. And then he'll no longer want to govern. Isn't it a beautiful night? Yes. Isn't the music pretty? Yes. Look at him! The old man is crazy for her! At his age! No wonder he wants to be boss! This won't work! I agree with everything the Prime Minister said. What will come of it? The sooner we act the better. He'll know who's boss tonight! Very good! Princess, I've something to tell you. No! No, not tonight. I'm too moved! Goodnight, Mr. Banco. Sleep peacefully. I will. Gentlemen, we will chase from the Palace this interloper! We swear it! This very night! This very night. Very good! Let's go, gentlemen! Gentlemen, you swear to follow your leader? We do! Put on your disguises! Look! Isabelle! Isabelle! Isabelle! What are you doing? - I've come to deliver you! - How? Tonight we will run away from here! What sort of danger are you risking for me? How long will this take? You're starting to get heavy! Then I'll take over. Then here. My love, I'll go with you. Farewell. What are you doing? Tomorrow I'll take you away. I love you. Couldn't you pay attention? Dropping your leader! Come on, we're going! Farewell! Banco! Banco! What's going on? We are those who reigned in Casinario in the Fourth Century. Oh really? What do you want? If you insist on your role, Banco, woe unto you! If you wish to avoid the dagger of our vengeance, abandon your power... - Go on... that you have stolen! Fear for your life! Very good. Come! We can sneak by him. He's sleeping! What is it? - It's treason! - Follow your orders! Time is precious! Hurry! Help us! What are you doing here? I'm looking for my other slipper. Yes, yes! Is it here? In here! Mr. Banco! What has happened here? Some people tried to kill me, Madam! Where is my detective? Go get Mr. Banco's detective! Mr. Banco's detective! Go get him yourself! Couldn't you search for my slipper? Sir! Sir! Wake up, sir! There's been an assassination attempt! Not us, not us! In there! Quickly! In there! Let no one leave! Let no one leave? But after all... Your Majesty, let Mr. Brown do his job... determining the guilty parties! That's my slipper! Really? It's yours? Of course, look! Aha! Very good, very good... You'll allow me? Let's leave this where we found it. I won't need you... For the moment! Why aren't you wearing a tie? Oh no, really... It's all right, it's all right... Aha! A chair served as the weapon. The attacker tried to kill Mr. Banco with a chair. Of course. Would you like to take your place in the bed? Gladly. After all, sir, who do you suspect? Everyone, Madam! Are you in bed, Mr. Banco? - Yes. Do you have your gun, Mr. Banco? Mr. Banco, shoot into the air with your gun! Shoot again! Shoot again. Aha! Did you hear that noise? Did you hear that, Mr. Banco? Mr. Banco! What has happened, my fellow? - Oh! It's incredible! Be quiet! No one move! Carefully! Careful... Stay down, Mr. Banco, stay down! Good morning, Mr. Brown! Did you sleep well? I must inform Your Majesty that Mr. Banco has been the victim of a second attack! Yes. Everyone out! Tomorrow I will interrogate the witnesses. Come, my child, come! Touch nothing! You go too. I will stay here alone with Mr. Banco. No! He's staying. You see? What a pretty tie you have on, sir! I'd like one like it. Won't you tip your hat like everyone else? Down with Banco! Death to the tyrant! What's going on? What is this? Gentlemen, we must admit defeat. Mr. Banco is henceforth the master of the State. Well? Why don't they play the royal anthem as I pass? The royal anthem is played only for the passing of the Queen. What? - Exactly, sir! - Yes, yes. Then you must write a new melody for me. If you don't, I'll put you in prison! Everyone sit down! Go on! In your places! Gentlemen, Gentlemen... Mr. Brown has the floor! Gentlemen, an assassination attempt was made last night on Mr. Banco. The assassins attempted to bludgeon the leader of the government... with a chair. First Article: All chairs and seats with four legs... are henceforth considered weapons. As a consequence, seats are banned from the kingdom. Reject your armchairs! Did you hear me? Stand up and reject your armchairs! Hello, hello! Hurry up! And now, let's continue! Help me, gentlemen! Article Two: The Palace orchestra must play a new melody... every time I pass by. The royal anthem is suppressed! Pardon? According to tradition, the Palace orchestra must play the royal anthem! And nothing else! Be quiet! It can't play anything else. - Very good! Arrest this man! Can't I even speak? Don't argue! After all gentlemen, Mr. Banco... Article Three: Whoever disapproves of my decisions, will go to prison. Whoever disapproves of my decisions, will go to prison! Very good! Article Four: During the period of the organization of Finance, everyone must observe silence. Except me. As a consequence, now... no one can speak without my permission! Very good! He spoke! Arrest that man! But I... Bravo! Bravo! Him now! Gentlemen, I've the honor to ask you to approve the measures... that constitute this first decree! Answer! Who approves? The Council of Ministers approves unlimited powers! The meeting is adjourned. Well? Who is that charming person? That's Princess Isabelle. For the two months that Mr. Banco took over the administration of the country, Casinario experienced a complete reorganization. For two months, a new order was born: The people agreed to submit to the discipline of the State. Thus, every day the people met in the exercise plaza to put the population in uniform physical shape... in order to conform more easily to the service of the State. Regarding the economy, the great financier Banco applied his ingenious ideas. Thus, recently all new hats were taken from the stores and thrown into the sea by a police officer. In order to give new incentive to the hat industry. Those who talk of the sea signifies at length to Mr. Banco the utility of life preservers. Thus once a week, the residents of Casinario must utilize this instrument. Mr. Banco pronounces every word he says as great... in order to announce his projects in a parliament that he has formed himself. The unanimous assembly acclaims the Chief of Alita as he introduces the most important reform of his regime: This reform has been accomplished today. All citizens shall wear beards. And regardless of their age, must on Sundays and holidays wear short pants. Breakers of this law are put in prison. Audacity! Always audacity! As the great financier said in a speech to the people, "Let's work together for a great Casinario!" Incredible! Mr. Banco has gone mad! For six months we've gotten no news from him except for this film? What do you think, Mr. Ambassader? I think that... My God, it's... Right! So Mr. Director, what news have you got about Mr. Banco? Excellent! Excellent. Couldn't we get some details? But Mr. Banco is still in Casinario! It's a serious situation! With a dive in the market, we've got an important decision to make... For some months we've had no idea what to do... Mr. Banco hasn't given us any word! What? No one answers. The line is very busy. I'll leaving. I'll be in Casinario in a week... otherwise all is lost. Allow me to tell you what's happened... I forbid you to speak! But I must! You're facing ruin! You've lost on the market! Later, later...I'm very busy. Good evening! Go to bed! But when Mr. Banco meets you, what does he say? He says, "hello"! Doesn't he recognize you? I don't know if he recognizes me. I believe he has completely forgotten we'll be married. You regret it! This is the weapon with which our ancestors of the Fourth Century... liberated the country from slavery. I know. I saw it in the museum. Come here! Are you a man? - Yes. Are you worthy of your ancestors? - Yes. Then follow me. You must deliver our country from the tyranny of a madman! With this sacred weapon, this very night. Okay. He's sleeping! My son, you are doing this deed for Casinario! It doesn't fire! Who's that? I don't know. We must hurry. But... His final hour has come! But shoot the gun! - I am. Keep quiet! Silence! Here! Second verse! Will you give me that? It's impossible, Mama! It's never work! You must do something, my son! It doesn't matter what! Goodnight, Mr. Banco! Goodnight! I believe you've taken my paper! Oh, it's yours! - Yes! You should leave, don't you think? Very amusing! Pardon me, but could you repair this rifle? Imbecile! What's going on? Ah, you made it go off! - Shut up! Something terrible must have happened! Let's go see. I knew it! But this time, I'll find the guilty persons! Don't move! No one shall leave. A crime has been committed! Tell me... Don't you need my slipper this evening? Don't move! No one leave! A crime has been committed! Madam! What is it, sir? Madam, Mr. Banco is dead. In my capacity as Chief Detective of Casinario, I must inform Your Majesty, that I accuse you of murder. Take that! Don't move! I'm in pursuit of a criminal! He isn't dead! What's going on? Come here. First off, what are you doing in my room? Couldn't you let me sleep quietly? But sir, but sir... Haven't you been injured? Injured? That's crazy! You should be more careful of your appearance, my friend! Why aren't you wearing a tie? Like the other valets? But I don't have a tie. Isn't my tie pretty? It's always the same! Ah, you're wearing a tie! Get out of here! I won't have a madman around me! Don't move! Stay there! No one can leave! He isn't dead? Tell me, Mr. Brown... Is Her Majesty the Queen at the Palace? I was very happy that she consented to meet me. You wish to speak to the Queen? But...it's easily done. He isn't dead! You can leave. And my shoe? The Queen! Where is the Queen? Isabelle! The Queen! Where is the Queen? Your father will never be King. Your mother will never be Queen... And you are free! You won't marry Mr. Banco. Oh, Bravo! I knew it. You know nothing. Mr. Banco is dead! As for me, I must flee! Farewell. What is this man doing here? That Her Majesty pardon me! We are secretly engaged. My children, be happy. Farewell. The Queen! Where is the Queen? The Queen! Where is the Queen? Isn't that you, Your Majesty? Close the window! Is this all you've found? I believe that for a valet... Why are there no armchairs in my rooms? But it's because... Oh, I don't understand! Go on, go on... Someone! Get a chair! - All right, I'm coming! Quickly! Are there still armchairs in Casinario? But why would there no longer be any, Madam? Forgive me, Madam, forgive me. I accused Your Majesty injustly. I was mistaken for the first time in my career... I want to be punished. I don't understand. We don't need you here. You can retire. No, Madam. I want to be arrested. Leave us, sir! Very well, Madam. In my capacity as Chief Detective of Casinario, I arrest myself for the crime of suspecting Your Majesty. Did you want to speak to me, Mr. Banco? I would simply like to ask Her Majesty... in her generosity to fix the date of the ceremony. What ceremony? The wedding! Could we talk about this tomorrow? Goodnight, Mr. Banco, goodnight! We must rid the kingdom of this dangerous madman! I take this rifle from the liberators of the Fourth Century. I fired! There was no gunshot. As it wouldn't fire, I cracked him over the head with the gun. A blow against the tyrant! Imbecile! Banco's still alive! And still crazy! Come to Isabelle's room so we can talk! What really happened tonight? The outcome of our destiny... the happiness of Casinario... depends on you! - Not again? - Yes! In a few days you will marry the richest man in the world! What? What? Who is this man in your room? You know him! Yes, but... in these clothes? Your Majesty, forgive us! We're secretly married. For an hour? No...longer. Give us your blessing! - Yes! Banco has regained his senses! He wants to marry Isabelle! But Isabelle's already married! Mr. Banco, I beg you to listen to me! Hello! But what are you doing? Get up, my good man! I've got serious news for you. You might be ruined. Ruined, me? Are you crazy too? Allow me to speak to you. - But of course. - Just for a moment! Crazy! They're all crazy! Aren't you done yet? Still no chairs? You still don't understand. It's already too late. Insist! Call the Ministers! I don't get it. You ask for chairs... Let the Ministers come in! Under these conditions, couldn't you just stand? - You think so? - Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen! I see no ties. Are they no longer the thing? Ties! Ties for the ministers! Where is the orchestra? Where are the musicians? - Go get the ties! - The orchestra leader! But...she took everything! I've thought it over. Nothing is lost! If you can marry secretly, you can divorce secretly! Yes, but she's gone! Isabelle is gone? But where is she? Gentlemen, the day of my wedding... I will deposit into the treasury the agreed-upon sum. Therefore it is vital that we fix the date for the ceremony... in the interests of the State. Very good! But you must alert your colleagues. It's a matter of protocol. Very well... What's going on? The Minister of Protocol! Have him enter! No! Get up! Things have changed! Mr. Banco, I've got the Bank on the phone. Her Majesty the Queen! Good day, gentlemen! If Your Majesty will excuse me... Hello? I'd like to talk to the London Director. What do you mean he's not there? Then get me the Senior Representative. The Banco Bank goes into possession in three days. Closed! Yes, closed! What? Yes... Get someone to speak to me. I'd like to speak to one of my investors. This is Mr. Banco. Yes, Banco! The President of the Bank. Yes, Mr. Banco! But you'll have to talk to the police. The bank is closed. They told me to send everyone to the police. Sit down, my dear friend! I've got good news for you! The police are searching for the Princess. I'll be married in a few days. Isn't that so? Yes, in several days. Therefore send to Casinario... the sum we spoke of. Yes, 300 million. No, not 400. Oh, no! Naturally! So I can count on you? But I don't know, sir! You should ask the police. They told me to send everyone to the police. Yes. Good evening, Mr. Banco! Good evening, my dear friend! I'll see you soon. All has been arranged. The wedding... Yes, yes... You must excuse me, Mr. Banco... - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Never forget your leader! Goodbye! Farewell! Enough! Stop that music! Search their bags. You see? What is that? Forgive us! I'll tell you the truth. We've been married for three years. And these are your great-grandchildren. Come now! Courage! We're talking off. Quick, hurry up! Fine! I will sacrifice myself to save the State! Isabelle! Isabelle, come quickly! I've got Casinario! - You've got Casinario? - Yes, come listen! Today, it has been announced in Casinario the wedding of Her Majesty the Queen to Mr. Banco, the famous financier who is, Prime Minister of Casinario. The crowds acclaim their glorious Queen. The royal anthem will be played by the Palace orchestra which we will hear presently. Come! It's unheard of! What is it? Read this! There. Didn't you know already? The people are calling for Your Majesty! Madam, we have a duty to the people! But sir, it can't be true? But it is, Madam! So you're ruined? Completely! But I count on the generosity of Your Majesty for a small pension! Subtitles by ironhills December 2010
