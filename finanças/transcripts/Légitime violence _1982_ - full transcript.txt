QUEST FOR JUSTICE - Hi. - Hi. Good job. - I didn't get the lyrics. - Don't worry about it. Lights! - It sucks! - Break? Do whatever you want! - Be back soon! - Can I go? - Yes, bye. - Coming, Eddy? How was I? Great! How's your boyfriend? Hugues? I dumped him. Good. He got on my nerves. You're the man of my life. You get my love. The others get sex. - Someday, they'll get angry. - Don't worry about it. - Dinner? - I'm paying. - Here's a gift. - For me? What for? For you. Wonderful! I'll practice my scales as I open my door, Eddyctator. I hadn't heard it in a while! - You OK with money these days? - Yes. Need anything? What's the matter? You're all hot and bothered. - I'm in love. - A guy or a girl? - A girl. - Marry her, then! I'd like to, but she's married to a leech. The scumbag doesn't want to divorce her. So? I thought of a sham. A picture of you and him together. She can use it to dump him and I can marry her. Find another girl. I don't wanna be used for bait. Besides, it's disgusting. We gotta stick together in this shitty world. The superstar singer just wants to sleep with you. I'm the only one on your side. I'm counting on you. That's why you'll help me. You must have some girlfriend who could do the trick. I have plenty of girlfriends, but I only have one sister. And I need her help 'cause she plays pool well.? The husband in question is a pool enthusiast. What did I do to deserve this? Nothing, that's why you'll help me. I won't ruin my life or my career over those small-time crooks. I'm the head of the Republican Action Group, not them, not you. Me, Andr?tti. I don't want to pay for hitches along the way. Exactly, I'll stay here for as long as you need to clear my name. Yes. Otherwise... I'll speak to the examining judge. MONTDARIEUX MASSACRE THE LONG-AWAITED HEARING OF R. ANDR?TTI, HEAD OF R.A.G. The pool table is free. - Here. - Not having anything to drink? Everything's so expensive nowadays. Kiss, double cushion, then in this right pocket. That's one way to look at it. No, that's one way to win. There! - A stroke of luck! - Pool, like chess, is highly scientific. An open 30-minute game or a 50-point game? No, thanks. You don't like to lose, do you? Your ego's so big, it's swelling your ankles. No. My ankles are fine. Don't you think? - What do you want? - To play. My train leaves in 2 hours. So, are you up for it? - Are you from Deauville? - Dotted or not? Don't insist. I bet you one Leftist minister against 2 Rightist ones, I'll win. I'm a Centrist. How bold! Dotted or not? Dotted. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Careful not to fall, dear! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Look at me, Pauline! Move around. We sang, what else do you want us to do? - Ready, Mom? - It works on its own? Yes, come. Spin round! Keep spinning round! I should've taught you the waltz when you were small. Some dancer you are! You OK? - Scared? - No. Good, 'cause I am. What about you? Don't piss me off, Jockey. See you! Pauline, be a darling... - There's no rush. - Yes, there is. I already gave you the map. Bye! We're gonna miss the train. It's always like that with you two. There's no rush! Don't catch cold! Are you coming back on Saturday? - It depends if I work or not. - Good God, that's slavery! I have a shitty job. I got a hump on my back and 2 horns. What? It's got nothing to do with me. "Cunning Bull" is what they call his department. - Fucking Franco! - Calm down, Dad. Franco's dead. Train No. 615 is departing from platform 7 at 5:10 PM. The train is now leaving. Say thanks to Granny. For the train ride. Eddy! Eddy! MASSACRE IN DEAUVILLE ANOTHER AURIOL AFFAIR? SIX PEOPLE DEAD, INCLUDING R.A.G. HEAD, ANDR?TTI Mr. Modot, please come to the reception. Mr. Modot, please come to the reception. Mr. Modot? Dr. Floquet would like to see you in the OR. Mr. Modot? Your father is saved. When he wakes up in few hours, don't tell him anything about your family. I don't know what to tell you. Your wife, your mother, your daughter... Road Traffic Information, I'm listening. I'm leaving right away. Sorry about all the work I'm leaving you. Get better, Martin. That's all that matters. If you need anything I'm here. Here we have a map that gives us the traffic report in real-time. The screens show us the roads. Mr. Modot? Insp. Gouvion and Insp. Carducci. - Rouen Regional Crime Squad. - I told you everything I knew. Yes, but bear in mind we have to finish the investigation. I don't bear anything in mind. I don't think anymore. Since my family was massacred, the police questioning, the funeral, the journalists... I'm not myself. I'm like a zombie, so thinking... I know it's hard, but, in addition to your family, there's this Andr?tti guy. I don't give a shit about Andr?tti's death. Had he not intervened, my family would still be alive. - It was common courtesy. - An idiot. Problem is, he was supposed to meet the examining judge the day before his death. How unfortunate! But my daughter wasn't meeting the examining judge. - Lucky her! - That's not what I meant. - May I? - Please. One more question. The girl you told our Rouen colleagues about, you said you'd already seen her. I did, but you know, it's just a fleeting image. I see. - It resembles my description. - You still find it does? Yes. What's the matter? Interested? Do you recall any other details? - The killers, for instance? - It happened so fast. There were two of them dressed like madmen... What was the name the girl shouted? Don't remember. Mr. Martin Modot? If you're a cop or a journalist, this is a bad time. Philippe Miller, founder and director of CAPMAC. We're against the abolition of the death penalty Your family tragedy upset everyone from our association. We read about it in the papers... And you wanna help? No, thanks. Your mistrust is understandable. - Leave me alone! - I'm no salesman. I've got nothing to sell. Nothing! So, listen up! Our association has 27,000 members. It's an apolitical, nonprofit organization. - People like you and me... - Your point? ...united against the apathy of justice and of a certain faction of the police. We're ready to help, support and defend you. - You can turn us down. - It's just as well! Perfect! Let those who killed your family get away with it! Bravo! Know what the surgeon told me? Two pieces of metal didn't get the better of my old body. Martin, are you listening? Yes. I bore you. The house must feel really empty. Are you eating well? Yeah. I took 2 weeks off work. I feel like selling everything. - Everything that reminds me... - Don't do anything stupid! Are you crazy? Someone has to look after you. I had mom's tomb covered in black marble. It's very nice. She had her faults, but she was a good woman. She was always there in difficult times. A good woman. Thanks for the magazines, son. We'll get through this. Yeah. We'll make it through. In time, as they say. See you, Dad. Careful not to fall, dear! Pauline, look at me! Mr. Modot, you're one of the only witnesses, except for this girl which you described and is nowhere to be found. Yes, of course. I made everything up to cloud the issue. I didn't say that, but only you noticed her. Andr?tti's murder is pissing politicians off. Modot, do you remember Ben Barka, Curiel, the Auriol killing? All those cases were never solved. Without the massacre, Andr?tti's death would've been a closed case. Look here! See this woman? My wife was beautiful, sexy and enjoyed making love. Look at the picture! My daughter's name was Pauline and she was 7 years old. May I help you, sir? - Is Mr. Miller here? - He's out. What is it about? - Well... - You're Martin Modot! Yes, how did you know? I saw you on TV that day, you were still in shock. Right... If I can help in any way... Well... The police are passing the buck. My case is... I thought your association could maybe... But when I see all this... - It's only advertisement. - I know. Bye. - I'll tell Mr. Miller you came. - Right. Quick, go get dressed. No flashing! Quick! So you came. It's good you did. How's the investigation? The police are questioning me, cross-examining me, tailing me, like I'm the real culprit. I'm getting really confused. They gave me a piece of paper. It's a portrait of a girl they're looking for. She's a witness. I feel like nobody cares. The law doesn't care, but the members of our association do. We're on your side. We're deeply moved by your story. Is the police investigation at a standstill? Yeah, they seem more interested in Andr?tti. They're really useless. Andr?tti. A politician, of course. That'll allow them to distort the facts. Lousy politics! Governments change, but shit keeps happening. If they arrest your family's murderers, they'll get a political trial. With some good lawyers, in 5 years max, they're out. They'll write their memoirs, get published, win prizes, appear on TV! Modern heroes. You're exaggerating. Think so? - How's work? - OK. I took a leave of absence to take my mind off things... - I need to work out. - "The exercise of the muscles "elucidates the myths - "that words had made." - I see. That's a saying by Mishima, the Japanese novelist who committed suicide. Handsome, isn't he? Bright as a saber! Nadine, my niece. - Mr. Modot, a friend. - Miss. - Got something to tell me? - Goodnight. Go to bed. I'll come kiss you goodnight later. Goodnight. Goodnight. Nadine! Look at her carefully. How do you find her? Charming. "Charming"? No, angelic! I'm sorry. I was trying to take your mind off things. Don't bother, Miller. I don't have a lot of money, but I'm ready to give all I have to find the murderers. Do you think... ...your association could help with that? Careful, Modot, CAPMAC isn't a detective agency. Our goal is to demand justice for victims. What does that mean? It's very abstract. Concretely, what will you do - to get justice? - We'll take a legal approach. Press campaign, tracts, slogans. We kick the police's ass, they're lousy anyway, and do their job by finding the girl. That's it. Welcome to CAPMAC, Mr. Modot. REWARD You're sure it's a good likeness? How's it going? We've distributed 1,500 tracts. Our goal is 3,500 by tonight. - Miss! - Yes? - Is this you? - No, sorry. Miss! - Enough! - I'm sure it's you. Shit! Loser! Right, we're fascists, Nazis! I doubt you know what those words mean. It's simpler than that: We're honest folk who've had it with theft, armed assault and ineffective justice. CAPMAC, hello? Yes. Yes. I'm writing it down. In the 16th borough? I called your association. - You think... - Second floor, on the left. Beware, I think she's on drugs. She always wears sunglasses. - Thank you, concierge. - I prefer "caretaker." Bye. - What's your name? - Lola. Off you go! Yes? - Anyone else live with you? - Nope. - You live alone? - Yes. If you wanna come in... No, I'm looking for this girl. I was told she lives here. So, Gouvion? You couldn't justify your salary by doing something else than tailing me? I'm a cop. Just doing my job. - Complain to my superior. - Why are you always up my ass? To protect you and prevent you from doing something stupid. The CAPMAC is just a bunch of fascist crackpots. I don't like militiamen who take the law into their hands and puke on the police. We're not perfect, but we're not vigilantes. If you did your job right, people wouldn't resort to them. It's more ambiguous than that. In theory, I'm paid to check off questions in a file. In theory! It all depends on the case and my superior's interest in it. Brousse, my superior, is very intrigued by this case. - I don't get it. - Me neither. Spending the night here? Goodnight. Let me go! - Let me go! - Your brother wants to see you. That had a calming effect. Go pack a few things and come with us. - Don't think so. - I do, bitch. Don't be so vulgar! Sorry, he's impulsive. My name's Jockey because of the boots. - His name is Mata-Hari. - A little feminine, no? - Wanna see the equipment? - Can you even get it up? Drop it! Hurry up, Lucie. - A little too polite. - Class transcends social milieu. He drinks tea with a drop of milk! - An intellectual? - No, a bourgeois. Enough chatter, Jockey. We came to take her along. Hurry, sweetie! I won't move. How do I really know you're friends with Eddy? Good point. He gave you a piano-shaped keychain, right? - Let's go. - Or else... You beat me up, while you take out a razor and you both rape me? We're not that kind of people. This is a lot more dangerous than a razor. You're lucky you're Eddy's sister. - Why? - I know your brother well. He can be difficult if angered. Plus, he's our dealer. - Happy? - Don't be stupid. Take a few things and come with us. If Eddy wants to see me, he should come get me himself. He's been looking for you for 10 days, bitch! Stop insulting me, put away your knife and get out - or else I'll scream... - Go ahead, bitch, scream! - For God's sake! - Mata! Calm down, Mata. Hello? Yeah, hi, Plastic. I can't come. Ask Coralie to replace me. I'll explain another time. Kisses. Bye. The sun is still high, the meadow covered in dew, your dog comes and goes, sniffing around, leaves and comes back, while you, holding your rifle, on the lookout, you feel totally free. All of a sudden, your dog points, everything sits still, some duck or some pheasant takes off heavily... And you, bam! Without thinking twice, you sign its death warrant. I hate hunting, don't you? I'm sure you have a rifle, Mr. Henri. Yes, but I don't have to pull the trigger. Know her? No. This girl, you, your 2 lousy acolytes and myself, way too many people are involved in this. It's a small world. I'm just a middleman. I tell you what I hear. The hunter is a cold-blooded killer. If he comes home empty-handed, he could kill a harmless toad out of spite. He could even kill his dog or even another hunter. But that'd be an accident. - So many hunting accidents! - I don't know, I don't hunt. That's a shame! I trust you, Eddy, but not the others. Think I'm an idiot, Mr. Henri? I kill the other two and I'm the only one left who could get injured. Go fuck yourself! Funny, coming from a gay nightclub manager. - For those 2 idiots! - Where were you? - I looked for you everywhere! - For the last 10 days, I've been wondering if you're a scumbag or not. - Coward, you fled the station! - I came back for you. I don't believe you anymore, you filthy liar! To think I believed your older-brother-in-love act! A sham picture, a leech of a husband... "I need you, Lucie." I can't believe it! Be quiet! You don't know. - You're disgusting! - Cut it out! What are you doing here? Scram! I said, "Scram!" - Easy, Eddy! - What? Get lost! Drop it, Mata. And you, calm down. Let's go. It's their fault. The holdup was a diversion. They were supposed to shoot Andr?tti and that's it. But these idiots were armed to the teeth. They decided to play cowboys and fucked up. You're sick! Raving mad! You used me to kill a man. Now you tell me you messed up? You're disgusting! We'll go to the police and you'll tell them everything. I don't wanna be an accomplice. It's my only way out! I'll go alone if I have to. - I'll be dead first. - Threatening to kill yourself? If you tell the cops, I am dead! I'm scared, Lucie! They have me by the throat. I did something really stupid. What? Some money deal. I had to do this to erase my debt. If the police find out, they'll kill me - and you too. - Turn them in! You want me to go tell the teacher? This isn't the schoolyard. These people are protected. Now you'll do as I say. What will we do? You hide here. In a month, everything'll be forgotten and we'll clear off. "Forgotten"! How do you expect me to forget all these people killed? You made me an accomplice of this horrible murder. Who do you think I did this for? The money problems, the club, everything? For you, Lucie. So that you never lack for anything. It pains me to see you crawl to all the losers in Paris. I want you on stage, alone, and I want to watch you perform. There's no harm in that. There's no harm in that. Thank you! And now, make way for the dancers! You sing like a goddess. - How about a drink at my place? - You'll be disappointed. - Let me be the judge. - Scram! I'll shower you with jewels, my queen. 1,000 f. - You'll be disappointed. - I'm sure you have a huge dick! I'm a woman. The way you say that, I could almost believe you. If you're that paranoid, I give up. Think about it. No sex, no money. Pinball is cheaper: 1 f. - You were a hit! - I'm tired. Things are settling down. We'll make it, Lucie. Sure, we will. - Why don't you believe me? - But I do. - Going out? - Yeah. I'm going to play pool. I've had it with this place, - you and all these gays. - Be careful! - Good evening, Eddy. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. - No introductions? - A friend. He or she is lovely. Attention, please! Here he is. Give him a big hand! Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Thank you, Mr. Miller. - This is Nadine, my niece. - Nice to meet you. Have a drink! - May I kiss you? - Of course! This is so nice. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm a little emotional, but thank you for your kind reception. I'm here tonight thanks to CAPMAC. I raise my glass to CAPMAC and I say hip hip hurray! Thanks again! Help yourselves. OK, time to hit the buffet, everyone! Don't be upset, Martin. This man defended his property. The law recognized his right. We're celebrating this exceptional sentence. Roland, your TV appearance tonight was really great: - simple, efficient, perfect. - May I? - Both of you. - Sure. Thanks. Martin, - this is Roland Courtil. - Nice to meet you. Mr. Miller, when the judge came back, I knew we'd won. Second-degree murder can get you a 4-5 year suspended sentence. - Someone was killed, right? - Unfortunately. The rules of the game. - There are cops and robbers. - Are you a cop? No, but the fifth time we were burglarized, we didn't hesitate to shoot. I wasn't thrilled about it. What's the matter with him? That's Martin Modot. Deauville holdup. - He's still in shock. - Shit. I'll go offer him my sympathies. Don't bother. - You don't seem at ease? - Are you? I make do. - I find them all stupid. - Miller included? He's a real case! You don't get to choose your boss these days. You're gonna pay for this! You'll have to make it up to me. What's wrong? I forbade these young fools to talk to you! - It's not my fault. - It is. They wouldn't talk to a well-behaved girl. You're not a well-behaved girl. Take off your panties! - What? - Take them off now! Take them off or I'll tear them off! C'mon! - You take advantage of your age. - A little. - Someone wants to see you. - I'll be right there. - How may I help you? - Insp. Gouvion. Cops working at this hour! You're overzealous. We have a nice surprise! We've some distinguished guests: the French police. - Cut it out, Miller! - You know my name? Groundbreaking! Actually, they've got informers. We're off duty. We'd like to speak to Mr. Modot. You said, "Modot"? What is that? A new kind of dance? No. A new laundry detergent brand? A criminal? If he were one, he wouldn't be here. The police require our assistance. - It's an honor for CAPMAC. - Long live CAPMAC! You don't get it. We grumble at the justice system but not at the police. Better yet, we're happy to celebrate them. Really. You'll see, we'll give you a big hand. A round of applause for our friends the policemen. One, two, three! CAPMAC? She's at a poolroom, next to the nightclub. Yes, I'm certain. At this very moment. At Le Syst?e on Bayard St. Someone called to give me an address. You can go. Anyway, I've had it with merrymakers. - Thanks. - Bye, good luck! That guy looks familiar, don't you think? I don't see anyone. I don't like you, Jockey, or Mata for that matter, but you astound me. - I don't get you. - There's nothing to get. You think wealth can buy everything? I didn't get anything I wanted. I didn't want much... I don't believe in anything anymore. - Then kill yourself. - You'd like that. I want to be loved before dying, I want something spectacular. I don't want to be forgotten. Got any ideas? I'll think about it. Good evening. Champagne. You alone? Obviously. I've got a boner to pick tonight. Sounds bad. I could use some relief. How about it? Sorry, not my thing. Martin Modot. You know, the Deauville killing. I don't understand. I don't know who you are. This is a private area. So please... But I saw you at the Deauville train station. I did. You shouted someone's name. - I don't understand. - Yes, you do. Here. That's you! No, not at all. Tell me those names, bitch! You're crazy! Stop it or I'll call... - You don't look like a bitch. - I'm not. I really need those names. It's my reason for living. Five lifetimes wouldn't be enough for you to understand but one of my infernal nights. I'd be happy to help you, but I don't know how. I've got nothing to do with this Deauville story. You've got the wrong person. I don't understand anything anymore. It's strange. - I was sure it was you. - It wasn't. Listen, I need those names, I'll do anything to get them. I'll pay you if you want. - I'll give you anything... - I'm not that woman! Who's he? Some guy who followed me hoping for a wild night. Don't move. I'll handle it. C'mon, wake up. - You OK? - What happened? Get up. Hurry. - So, it is you? - No time for questions. Give me the names. Some other time. - You'll have to jump. - What are you doing? You'll jump out the window. That's closed. - You're crazy! - Come. No time to waste. Why here? And don't forget to hit me. - Why? - Otherwise they'll do it. Don't be afraid. Sorry. - Are you mad? - The guys' names! - No way. - What? You promised earlier. Earlier was earlier. Get out! If you don't, I'll kidnap you. I'd like to see that! - Gimme those names! - No! Let me go! You're wasting your time. I'm not in the habit of ratting out people. Who are these people? Your husband, lover? I won't talk. I was manipulated. I have nothing to do with your family's tragedy. I'll believe you when you give me the names. - What's your name? - Lucie Kasler. - Where to? - The police. Think I'll break down and spill? Fine. Let's talk, then. Why so quiet? I won't let you go until you give me the names. I'd like to help you, but I can't. I'll be accused of complicity. I'll get you the best lawyer in Paris. No. Impossible. I don't know much, but if I talk, they'll kill me. If they don't kill you, I will. I know 2 names. Know where to find them? Yes. Let's go see the cops. Insp. Gouvion, please. Dubois. - Age? - 21. I'd like to speak to the person in charge of the Deauville case. Over there. She holds important information concerning the Deauville case. Twists, last-minute witnesses... Not really the kind. Taking her statement or not? I'm doing all your work! No one asked you to. So, you've got information? Yes. OK, I'll go tell the chief. That's it. Regardless of the government, a cop's a cop. Easy! I'm used to this! I've had it! Shit! Calm down! Everything will be OK. Chief Insp. Brousse. Carducci told me everything. I'm listening. Inspector, this is Lucie Kasler and she has important information to disclose. Well? I've got nothing to say, inspector. What's the matter with you? Lucie? Not here! I hate violence. Please explain, Miss Kasler. He forced me to come. - He scared me. He's armed. - She's lying! Enough, Modot! Carducci, see the lady out. I'm keeping you. I hope you have a gun license. What about this? Look? You know facial composites... - Got anything else to add? - I wanna go home - and want him to leave me alone. - Right. Go ahead, Carducci. Calm down, pal. Come sit down for a minute. I'll go get you something to drink. Just a second. Modot! Next time, try to avoid this kind of mix-up. Inspector, I swear she lied. Even if she did, I'm a seasoned cop, Mr. Modot. I'm sure this girl knows something. So, she writes her statement, gives us the names of her unimportant sidekicks. The death of your family was an accident, Andr?tti's wasn't. I'm so happy I met Miss Kasler. Whatever you may think, being a cop is a true profession. Thanks to this young woman, I assure you, those who killed your family'll soon be arrested. You have my word. Go home. Trust me. I have to ask you to give me your weapon. Keep it. To show you I trust you. But be careful! Don't move. You, drive slowly. Gimme back my gun. - Quick! - I don't have it. - Ask the lady. - The cops took it. - Where to? - Eddy's. You hurt me earlier, turd. I feel less bad for your family. How did you find us? We've got big eyes and ears. Damn it! I've had it with women! Don't get married. You and your stupid stories. You can't dump me like that! You're insane! Eddy, no! Go ahead, shoot him up! - I know where I saw you. - Where? On TV. Eddy. That's the name you shouted at the train station. Why didn't you tell the chief inspector? He's Eddy's friend. Who's Eddy? My brother. Your brother? Yes. He's my brother and I love him. I wanna meet him. - Come here. - Leave me alone! I've had enough! This is all your fault! We gotta find a place to rest. He won't look for us here. You'll sleep on the box spring and I'll sleep on the mattress. Tomorrow, we go see the cops again. Count me out. You've never seen a naked woman? You knew the guy in the metro? His name was Jockey. He was one of the killers. One down. Happy? Yeah. What do you do on TV, Miss Kasler? Now that you've seen me naked, you don't need to be so formal. I'm a backup singer for Plastic Bertrand. I go "wawa" behind the singer. Know what I feel like? A game of pool. When it's all over, I'll go to America. To L.A. Lucy Lou. I'll wear a snazzy outfit and perform my songs in French poolrooms. You think I'm stupid? No. I'm sure you'll succeed. Are you sleeping? No. - Everyone's here? - Yes. Gentlemen... We're from CAPMAC. I'm Philippe Miller and I'd like to see Chief Insp. Brousse. Please call him. I can't promise he'll see you. Gentlemen, please. Don't worry, he'll see us. - So? - No can do. Come here, let's talk. Wait. Chief Insp. Brousse promised before the press he'd see all delegations, so go call him again. Alright. Shall I throw them out? No, no violence. These are the new orders. - Who are they? - A self-defense association. - CAPMAC? - Yes. They support Modot. Fine, I'll meet with the head. His name is Miller. Careful, he's an intellectual. Regardless, these people are allowed to know. I'll go get him. - So, no news of Lucie Kasler? - Not at the moment. Remember, this case is my sole responsibility. Meaning? I disapprove of your personal initiatives. Do as Carducci does and obey. Don't try to understand. You can see to your union activities. I'm a cop first and foremost. We all are, that's our job. Mr. Miller's expecting you. - What did he tell you now? - To be as stupid as you. I'm not stupid, Paul. I'm a coward. It doesn't stop me from thinking you talk too much. Listen, pal, I know what I gotta do and I'll do it! I'll be frank. - You will? - Yes. The Andr?tti case is political. ?ouard Kasler, aka Eddy Roc, is responsible for the Deauville killing. I'll be frank with you. I don't care about Andr?tti and your fucking politics! - I came here for Martin Modot. - Let me explain. Kasler and his accomplices murdered Modot's family. What I wanna know is what are you waiting for to arrest him? As the head of CAPMAC, you must know how hard it is to be at the helm. We're on the same side, Miller. Just between us, I think we voted for the same party. I don't lean to the Left. What about you? My heart's pure and I'm in my Right mind. That's what I thought. To prove to you I sympathize and trust you, I'll confide something to you. ?ouard Kasler will be arrested tonight. You're invited to the party. A party? You're inviting me? To do what? You're invited, but you have to come alone. All alone. Promise? One can always make promises. It's such a mess. I don't know when it'll end. Don't get your hands dirty. Respect the law. Defend yourself, fight, demand your right for justice, but I don't feel angry anymore. If I'd had your mom's killer in my hands, I would've gladly cut him open. But now... I haven't forgiven him. I want him to be punished, but not with my own hands. We're can't take the law into our own hands. That's not how I raised you. Old people aren't that stupid. C'mon! Hello, Modot. Let's go for a walk. If, by chance, you see Lucie Kasler, tell her her brother is about to have a terrible day. His last one. They're scrambling for the spoils. Contact Eddy ASAP. Here, this is where he's hiding. - Why don't you go? - Only you can do this. If you get there in time, he can make it out alive. I don't have my car. Don't worry, I'll be there. My car's over there. Good luck, Martin. Thanks. Yes. Right away. Phone. Henri de Varin speaking. This is Modot. I'm in a cop car. You have to find a way to clear Avenue de Paris. Yes, all green lights. - I warn you, it'll be a mess. - Thanks. Martin? Wait for me. - What do we do? - I'll call Brousse. Tell Brousse Modot and Lucie are here. Eddy! The cops are here! Eddy! Everyone in place. Don't play hero! Modot and Lucie Kasler are inside. Are you always this stupid? Don't move! Eddy, it's Lucie. Why did you switch sides? I'm not on the cops' side. I have to talk to you. I know you won't shoot me. - Not her, Mata. - She squealed. Shut up! Come with us. The cops wanna kill you. Scram! Eddy! Come down now, nothing'll happen to you. - Nothing but jail, idiot! - Better than a casket! Cut the crap. They screwed us. CAPMAC will be heard, the guillotine will come back. - Quiet! - We'll attack in 2 minutes. We have an appointment with Chief Insp. Brousse. - I doubt he'll see you now. - Go get him all the same. A nice little man! CAPMAC will be heard, the guillotine will come back. Silence! This scumbag deserves to be beheaded 20 times over. Now that capital punishment is abolished, this bastard will lounge in 3-star prisons thanks to your tax money. No, we shall not accept this! We are the people's justice. No mercy for our children's murderers! You are the people's justice! The people's justice! Quiet! You invited us, inspector. Cut the crap, Miller. Disperse yourselves. - Let the law handle this. - Sorry. My men won't budge. They represent the people's justice. Don't move. Eddy! I warned you! Eddy! Stop! - It's over! - You here? You can take your revenge. Think of your family. Shoot! Stop talking nonsense! Go down and tell the truth. You fucked Lucie, didn't you? She's a good fuck, isn't she? Isn't she? You're insane! Eddy Kasler, surrender. - The other one'll screw her too. - Are you really insane? I don't care about your sister. I'm focusing on you now. Is she a good fuck? I'll never know, so tell me. Tell me! The only thing I'm asking you is to come down and tell people why they died. Kasler, stop! Eddy, surrender. Come, let's go down. Death to the murderer! Ladies and gentlemen, ?ouard Kasler, the Modot family murderer was arrested, his accomplice killed. We got positive results. Congratulations to the entire squad for their efficiency. The French police acted fast and without prejudice. - What about the Andr?tti case? - Closed, - since all the accomplices died. - Wasn't Kasler involved? Eddy Kasler was but a sidekick. Death to the murderer! - I'm against capital punishment. - What about your CAPMAC friends? They're not friends. What's your relation to CAPMAC? I wanted the killer to be arrested. Modot, you were avenged! The case is solved. The people's justice has spoken! Modot, you were avenged! Move it! Come see me at the union, I have something to tell you. The investigation following this incident proved Brousse was involved in a militia, the R.A.G. Chief Insp. Brousse was transferred to the countryside. Insp. Gouvion was promoted chief inspector. The Interior Minister asked the R.A.G. to be dissolved. Translation: TV5 Qu?ec Canada
