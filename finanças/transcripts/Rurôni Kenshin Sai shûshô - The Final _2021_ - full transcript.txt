1879 (12TH YEAR OF THE NEW AGE) YOKOHAMA STATION You'll hurt yourselves! Rintaro! Was it you who sold a warship to Makoto Shishio? What might this be about? We are told a Shanghai arms dealer is on the train. How rude! This gentleman represents-- Shouldn't you start by introducing yourself? You're Japanese? You are Goro Fujita, Bureau of Police? Or is it Hajime Saito, formerly of the Shogun police? You want weapons too? I'll sell you all you want. Ironclads, Gatling guns, Snider rifles… Now that the Satsuma Rebellion's over, I've got lots. Bring him. On your feet. I wouldn't. Where's Battôsai the Killer? Why is the Shanghai mafia asking? Does he still have the scars on his cheek? What? Well? Does he still have the cross of scars on his cheek? He does, huh? They're still there? I guess my sister still hates him. You want a fight, Shinsengumi? Halt! Hold it! You want me? I'm all yours. Take him! ASAKUSA, TOKYO Sorry. That bride looks fine! Good for you! Will you look at that! Well! All these new Western ways. A white kimono would be nice, but I'd like that dress too. How many weddings are you planning to have? I prefer the old hairstyles. -Why? -What? They suit an old head? Kaoru? Kaoru! You're staring into space. She's imagining she's marrying Kenshin. You're a kid with a big mouth! Cut it out! Oh, Kenshin. It is certainly very beautiful. Ms. Kaoru? What's wrong? Figure it out. Huh? DOMESTIC AFFAIRS MINISTRY BUREAU OF POLICE TRAINING GROUND Begin! We've finally started. Very good. Mr. Maekawa. Chief Uramura. Several men from my dojo are serving as instructors here. They are? It's been 12 years since the Restoration. These young men have never seen war. Japan has sent troops to Taiwan and now to Korea. We're still arguing with China over our claim that Okinawa is ours. There could be war with China at any time. TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS Thanks for coming out. You're nothing but trouble. If you would confirm transfer… He wants you to confirm the transfer. Thank you. Come on. Why the hell did we free a Shanghai mafia boss? We didn't free him. He was released into custody of the consul under the terms of our treaty. Why should China judge a violation of our law? They have jurisdiction. It's the same with a Japanese in China. Enter. Remember Cho? One of Shishio's Ten Swords. He's been working undercover for us. Thanks for your help back then. I don't trust turncoats. Oh, dear! Don't be like that. He'll keep an eye on what Shanghai's doing. You know the drill. BEEF HOT POT AKABEKO Bring more! This isn't enough. I'm starving! Beef! It's been a while. Right? Here you are. Great! Where were you? Fencing with the constables at the Police Dojo. It's busy here. Tae works us hard. Find a boyfriend like Kaoru too, and I'll give you time off. Tae, stop it! Oh? You stop it too! Anyway, let's eat. That's hot! Why are you shoving it in? You shut up. Calm down, Kaoru! I am calm. I'm stuffed! Pig! And you eat too much meat. Your face is still red. You shut up. I'm not blushing. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm fine. It's time you got used to peace. If you would, Kujiranami. The opening shot of vengeance. What was that noise? Move! Stand aside! Out of the way! Move! Mr. Himura! What's going on, Chief? What's up? Someone fired a cannon into the city! They hit a beef place called Akabeko. Akabeko? It came from Ueno Hill. We'll surround the area. They might shoot again. Be careful. I'll go with the Chief. Go check on Akabeko. -Okay. -I'll come too! Come on! What's going on? Tae! Tsubame! Search the area! Only a shrine tree snapped off. Not even a trace of a gun mount. They probably used the tree to stop the recoil. Even if they did aim and fire from here, surely, they couldn't hit Akabeko! Chief! -Chief! -Yes? We found this. "Man judges"? It's usually, "Heaven judges." Don't they even know that? No. Someone will pass judgment in Heaven's place. JUSTIFICATION FOR EXECUTION The shogunate and the Shinsengumi… They both justified their killings that way. So this means… I think someone's saying if Heaven will not judge, then they will. I see. So some malcontents are still unhappy with the new government. We can't have that. -Follow me. -Yes, sir! -Search every corner of this area! -Yes, sir! Anyone in mind? No. The man from Shanghai? He sold Shishio that ship. He said something. "Does Battôsai still have his scars?" MAN JUDGES OGUNI CLINIC Hey! More bandages! We've used everything we had. I'll get more. Thanks. I'm finished here. -Press down on that wound. -Yes. Megumi! How are you doing? As best I can. Tae! Tsubame! She got burned trying to get people out. Kaoru and Yahiko just left. Oh, I see. What a thing to do! Ms. Kaoru? Yahiko? Are you all right? Yes. We were checking on the injured at Megumi's clinic. Tsubame and Tae? Anyway, who could have done something this horrible? Megumi, can I ask you something? What? Kenshin's scars… They're pretty old. Why don't they fade? I don't know. I asked Dr. Oguni about that once. And? It was half superstition. He said a scar inflicted in righteous anger won't disappear until that anger is appeased. You're still up? Sano… So what's going on that we don't know about? Kenshin… I understand very well that you don't want to worry Kaoru, Yahiko, and Megumi. But… surely you can tell me. What's that noise? Mr. Himura! Open up! Mr. Himura! Come quick! The Maekawa Dojo! What? An attack. It's a slaughter. The police came, but they're no match! -I'll come! -No. I'll be back by morning. Keep the gate shut tight. You're in charge. Mr. Himura! -Mr. Himura! -What now? Have Chief Uramura put guards at the Kamiya Dojo and Oguni Clinic. There's no word from the Chief. We're going there now. Kenshin. Leave the Maekawa Dojo to me. You go to the Chief's. I thank you. URAMURA Put that down, or I'll shoot! Fool! You think that thing will stop me? Husband! Who are you? What do you want? What the hell's going on? Okay, who's next? Damn you! What do you want? Oh, relax! You won't be lonely. You can all die together. No! Kill me instead! Don't hate me for this. Instead… Hate me? Quite enough people hate me already. Left cheek, crossed scars… Mr. Himura! Be careful! So it's you? Battôsai the Killer? Perfect. Tell me… who's using you for revenge? A good guy. We used to see who could kill the most in a night. It was fun. So you've led a life of shame too. We're two of a kind. If you're after revenge, I'll fight all you want. But don't drag others into this. Mementos of my god-given gift! Get out! Hey! Are you alive? I'm too late! What happened? I know what you're thinking. "Who are these guys?" "How many of them are there?" "Who's the leader?" "Where will they attack next?" Suffer, then. Now man judges. Mr. Himura! Why? Why us? Why? What's the matter, Battôsai? You look as if you've seen my sister's ghost? You… It can't be… What if it is? Will you kill me? Like you did her? With that filthy sword? It's been 14 years. I went to Shanghai, nearly died there, and worked my way up to the top of the Shanghai mafia. All the while planning to come back and avenge my sister. Just wait. Man's judgment is at hand. The men with me hate you too. And we are capable of anything. Battôsai… I don't want to simply cause you pain. I want you to suffer. Kenshin's here. What's all this trouble about? Hey, Kenshin. Kenshin! Welcome back, Kenshin. I'll get some rest. Something's not right. I've never seen him look so tormented before. Tokyo is now on high alert. The dojo of fencing instructor Maekawa was attacked last night. As was the home of Chief Uramura. Most of the officers who responded were injured. We don't know who the attackers were. However, this is clearly a challenge to police authorities. Our dignity is at stake. We must preserve public order in Tokyo! It wasn't easy, but I found them. Their armory. They've taken a place in Yokohama. A man named Wu Heixing. A Shanghai millionaire. Lack of scruples makes good spies. Thanks a lot! I was one of the Ten Swords. Like I'd really work for the new regime! After yesterday's events, we have 30 comrades stationed in the compound. Come in. It's been a while, boss. Heixing? When did you come back from Shanghai? I was told you're finishing up what you came to do. I just wanted to make sure you remembered our deal. I remember. Once I'm done, the organization is yours. Arms, opium… Do what you like. Japan will be yours. Good news, Tomoe. It's finally time for heaven to levy judgment on Battôsai. Enishi… Not you! You didn't know? They said they had told you. Go home, Enishi. You're our family's son. -Don't get mixed up in this. -To hell with the family! It's you I want to-- Go home, Enishi. Why? What happened? Why protect him? He's your enemy! He stole your happiness. You should want revenge! KAMIYA DOJO Last night after you two went out, Yahiko said… he was sick of being weak. In his own way, he senses that trouble's coming. He's trying to strengthen himself. Then I should talk to you all. Ms. Kaoru, get everyone together. Last night, the Maekawa Dojo and Chief Uramura's home were attacked. All to take vengeance on me. Vengeance on you? The Akabeko attack too. They were planned by a man named Enishi Yukishiro. Brother to Tomoe Himura… my wife, who I stabbed to death. As the shogunate fell… when… I got these scars. Woman, pour us a drink. We're out day and night risking our lives for the likes of you. Kyoto's no place for fake patriots. You're mine! I thought I'd come out and say thank you. You really… make it rain blood. I'll stay with you… a while longer. What is happiness? I feel like living here with you has answered that question for me. I was engaged to be married. Before the wedding in the unrest in Kyoto, he made the ultimate sacrifice. If you want revenge, get close to Battôsai and find out all you can about him. Find his weak points. Tomoe… the happiness you've lost once… you will never lose again. April 5th. Before our wedding, Kiyosato made the ultimate sacrifice. I can't die! There's someone I love. I want to avenge Kiyosato. Tomoe… Tomoe… Tomoe… You're angry too. Are you all right? This is the first you've heard about this Tomoe person. Yes. It's a surprise. But… I feel sorry for her somehow. Perhaps she was very pure of heart. She hated herself for falling for the man who'd killed her first love. And so… maybe she meant for him to stab her. I'm sure… Kenshin will never forget Tomoe. To love someone like that… so deeply… and… have her die by your hand. You'd never forget that. But you and Kenshin are alive. If you're alive, you can move on together. Now that Tomoe's dead, that's one thing she can't do. Go on. Go to him. Kenshin. Ms. Kaoru… I know you hate troubling people. I thought you might vanish again. Thank you. One gem after another! Well! A wo-dao Chinese sword! I've never seen one before. What? I'm busy here. You, huh? The sword thief who lost to Battôsai and switched sides? Sword hunter! Whatever. I sent the police to the wrong place, just like that Chinese guy Wu said to. That deserves some reward. This is a great sword. It could hurt you. The balance is different than Japanese swords. You seem sure of yourself. Do you hate Battôsai too? All of a sudden, I want to test this blade. KAMIYA DOJO Thank you for your efforts this past year. -Thank you, master. -Thank you, master. Dismissed! -Yes! -Yes! Take a break, and then we clean! -Yes! -Yes! Now, man judges. Why? Why us? MAN JUDGES Hello! Howdy! Misao! How are you? What are you doing here? Did you come from Kyoto? It took so long! Tokyo's so far away! Of course it is. Did you come alone? Aoshi too? Is Himura here? So what brings you here anyway? The Suikoji Temple priest heard from his late father that Himura had something to do with Elder's death. The father apparently knew Himura. Imagine that. Battôsai fighting alongside the Shogun's Hidden Watchers! Fate works in strange ways. Himura is living quietly in Tokyo now. I see. If you have the chance, could you take him a message? My father had his late wife's diary, and I'd like to return it. He often spoke with my father about how one who had killed so many should then lead his life. Or even if he still should live. Here. This is Tomoe's diary? You knew about her? Did you read it? I couldn't do that! I'm sure it's important to Himura, so I brought it. THE HEART TO LIVE IN AUTHENTIC TRUTH The Watchers told me something interesting. They said in December, Tokyo will rain blood. And Battôsai will be the cause. YOKOHAMA WAREHOUSE DISTRICT Squad 2, around to the left. Squad 3, secure the back door. We charge in. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. It's a damn trap! This should buy us some time. What's this? A newspaper extra? What is it? MAN JUDGES What's that? Look! What's that noise? The same as before. Captain Aoshi! I have to go! Let the festival begin! Take us down. Follow that. Do whatever you have to. Understood. Man's judgment is at hand. The men with me hate you too. And we are capable of anything. Battôsai… I don't want to simply cause you pain. I want you to suffer. Are you all right? Thank you! Hurry! Is Battôsai here? This is for him! Go. Upstairs! Hurry! Thank you! Who are you? Evil powers will bury evil-doers in darkness. As the last captain of the Hidden Watchers, that is my task. Whoever you are, you don't get in the way of Mumyoi! Don't just stand there! You too! Who are you? Is it you? Kenshin's brother-in-law? Well, he's not here. But if you've come looking for a fight, I'll give you one. You will, huh? Big talk from tiny glasses! Captain Aoshi! Captain Aoshi! It's Battôsai we want! Not you! Sanosuke! Guys, when you're in a fight, you use your head! Captain Aoshi! Captain Aoshi… Captain Aoshi! Captain Aoshi! Captain Aoshi! He shielded me. Are you all right? Thank you! Captain Aoshi! Captain Aoshi! Damn it! Wait, Battôsai! Finish me off. To restore the Emperor, you stole our samurai pride. You denied us… an honorable death. So now… with those hands… give me that now! That much you owe me! Run me through! I'm sorry. I have sworn that with this blade, I will never kill again. Live in the new age. Freeze! Then at least cut off this arm! Come quietly! Because if I still have it… Battôsai! Battôsai! Kill me! Please! Sano! Ken… Kaoru… Sorry. I'm sorry! He took Kaoru. I couldn't stop him. I couldn't do anything… but watch. Now you look good. Hold it! Keep your hands off her! Don't worry. Yahiko! "The heart to live in authentic truth"? That's dumb. Are you Enishi Yukishiro? So what if I am? Killing Kenshin or me won't bring Tomoe back. You just lose your soul… a prisoner of your rage. How do you know her? Did you hear that… from Battôsai? My sister's name? Here, I shall levy man's judgment. There's no escape. Man's judgment requires your death. Tomoe would not have wanted this. Silence. How would you know? Die! Die! You don't speak for her. Die! Die! Die! Die! Why? Why do you look so sad? Why won't you smile? TO LIVE IN AUTHENTIC TRUTH The man I met is a wanderer named Kenshin. Wandering is the easy way out. To help you out, why else? That sword is for you. Your life does not belong only to you. Worry about your own life before someone else's. I must not let him die now. I will preserve him though it means my life. Kenshin! Are you going? Yahiko… look after Sano. The first one to find him kills him. All right? Suit yourself. Come on. You called? It's a bit soon, but the organization is yours. Why is that? My private war is almost over. It's not as easy as that, boss. The Japanese police have gotten wind of this place. If you lose and they take you in again, our government won't be-- Heixing! What did you say? Do you think I might lose? No, never. Get out of here. One more word, and I'll kill you too! Are you turning tail? Shut up! We'll kill Battôsai, and then Yukishiro too. Mr. Wu… Thank you for your help in Kyoto. I understand you might have some work for me. You! Halt! Halt! So you're Battôsai? We've been waiting. Himura! Don't go keeping this to yourself! Ms. Misao! For Aoshi Shinomori, Captain of the Edo Hidden Watchers, Misao Makimachi stands with you! This is my job. Kenshin! Sano? Out of the way! Kenshin, go! Go, Himura! Go! Damn it! Go around! I don't have time to play now. "Play"? How dare you! I hold the trump card here! The greatest of the Ten Swords assassins, Sojiro Seta! Do your worst! You! It's been a while, Mr. Himura. Hey! What are you doing? I became a wanderer too. After Mr. Himura beat me, my life lost meaning. It's been a while since I drew a sword, but I'm probably better than you. Get them! Kill them both! That was fun. It's nice not having to worry about your back for a change. Go on ahead, Mr. Himura. And show me how that sword cuts old hatreds and frees those trapped in the past. I thank you. Come on. So you're here… Battôsai. Sorry to keep you. Where's Ms. Kaoru? Indeed… I wonder. Enishi, it's perfectly natural you'd want to avenge your sister. But stop pulling other people into it. Your enemy is me alone. I alone bear the guilt. Shut up! It's not you alone. It's all of you. Your friends, everyone you talk to, and all of this shit country you've made! Tomoe… the time has come at last. Man's judgment is at hand. Well, Battôsai? Does your wound hurt like my sister's? I'm damn sure it doesn't! Die! Only death can repay the sin of murder. Writhe in agony, and die in regret and despair! That is the only way you can atone! Stand up! This does not atone for your crime. Stand up, Battôsai! What's wrong? Can't take any more? Then kill yourself. Turn that phony back-blade on yourself and die. Bastard. You kill more than you can count, and you're afraid to kill yourself? Battôsai! I've thought about death many times. But I knew my death would never atone for my sins. Quit your babbling. I still have no idea… how to atone. But now… for my friends… and for the peace that Tomoe wanted… Enishi… I have to stop you. Enishi… do you see Tomoe… smiling now? How could my sister fall for you? Your feelings for her are not wrong. Nor is your hatred for me. But the way you are living is very wrong. End this. Tomoe… Tomoe… Battôsai! Damn you! Enishi… I'm sorry. You think I'm some kind of joke! I'll kill you! -All of you! -No! Keep out of my way. Bastard! Heixing! Don't get in my way! No! Stop! You'll kill him! You will! Thank you for protecting… Ms. Kaoru. No… No! Kenshin. I wanted to protect… The one I wanted to protect… Tomoe! Damn it! Damn it! Enishi Yukishiro, this came for you. TO ENISHI YUKISHIRO APPROVED BY CENSOR THIS DIARY SHOULD BE WITH YOU FOR YOUR SISTER'S SAKE, I PRAY THAT YOU WILL LIVE KAORU KAMIYA He is the man who robbed me of my happiness and the man who brought me happiness anew. He will kill again. But after all his killing is done, I am sure he will preserve many more than he has killed. I must not let him die now. I will preserve him… though it means my life. I WILL PRESERVE HIM THOUGH IT MEANS MY LIFE -Ten! -Ten! -One! -One! -Two! -Two! -Three! -Three! THE HEART TO LIVE IN AUTHENTIC TRUTH -Four! -Four! -Five! -Five! -Six! -Six! Don't overdo it. Be quiet. That hurt! Don't overdo it. What did you tell Tomoe? Thank you, I guess. In the end, Enishi saved me. But now I think maybe it was Tomoe watching over me. Enishi Yukishiro… I wonder how he's doing. He will have to atone as well. Not with his death, but with his life. Until he does that… the Tomoe in his mind will not smile. Kenshin… what did you say to Tomoe? The same as you. Thank you. And I'm sorry, and… goodbye. NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED IN THE MAKING OF THIS MOVIE
