[applause] [inaudible]. Would you like to? [applause] We're pleased to be here, all of us. And naturally, we're hopingto give you a good game. Most of the boys is Jamaican,so this is a majority decision. We had whip round, and wedecided to get you this. Oh, sorry. Here. - Charming. Absolutely charming. [applause] I'm not fucking Jamaican.

You'll find Rabbit Inn, Valentine, Gibbs-- great spinners. You see, I don't understandwhy all of the sudden you chaps want to be speed merchants. Derek's been doing his homework. After all, that's a captain's job. So you think you could take us then? I'm quietly confident. You want to make a [inaudible] bet over it? So what do you do? I'm into race relations. There's not a lot ofcall for that around here. [laughter] [music playing] Come on over. We must get some tea. All right. Colonel? Would you please come over here?

So shall I play with Errol to start with and then we can swap round? We don't care. Whatever you like. Who do you want to play with? You, I suppose. Well, that's settled then, ain't it? Sit. May we join you? This is [inaudible]. I'm Godfrey Matthews. Who are you? Willie Boy. A nickname, is it? No. Lived here long? Oh, my dear fellow-- too long. Five years. Six years. One day seems much like the next. Were those your boys I saw earlier today? Boys? Tall boys. Striking. Muscular. I have a daughter here, but no son. I wanted to talk to them. Wanted to ask them about games. If black men should be playinggames in times like these. If there aren't moreimportant considerations. Course we should play games. Everybody got to relax, man. The only reason you complaining is because black men are always licking you. Well, there may be something in that. I paid a brief visit to the Caribbean once. Palm trees, coconuttrees, white beaches, rum. Corrugated iron roofs. Hobbits. Then I went back to Africa. You used to live in Africa? Many years. You didn't like the Caribbean. I loved it. Ah. What about poverty then? There ain't much poverty inthe Caribbean now, you know? I've been there. Don't be ashamed of poverty. I'm not ashamed. I'm going back. You're going back? [laughter] We're all going back. That's where I'm from. I'm going back. Hey, that was great. This lucky guy. The appliance of science. Shut up and play the game. Oh, hey Yvette. Didn't see you come in. Do you want a game? Come on, Stuart. Aren't you playing? I'm going for a walk. Stuart, it's your shot. MAN: One thing saying colored. It's quite a different thing saying black. To start off, they're different implications. Like on my farm. Black horses. White horses. [laughter] The same. Different. [laughter] Hey, Yvette, where you going? For a walk. Listen, can I come? On my own. Can we come? Explain to us different? Different! Different! I think I better be going now. I'll come with you. I was going to buy you all another round. The night's still young. Hey, Jeff, man-- you're goingon like a 15-year-old, man. Your wife out with you tonight, man? [laughter] What's going on? [engine] Goodnight, Willie Boy. Sleep tight. Uh, yeah. Goodnight, man. See you sometime tomorrow. I thought he was a bowler. So I said to him, what are you bowling? Chunker's spin,leg-cutters, the odd Yorker? And he said, strictly pace. [laughter] I don't get it. What's it mean? Strictly pace. Oh, you mean fast? Yeah. That's what I thought he meant. I suppose we'll just haveto wait until tomorrow to find out. I'm not sure I want to find out. [music playing] Are you lost? A bit. We're about two mile from the village. Want a lift back? No. If you tell me the way, I'll just walk back. You got to be joking. All sorts of stuff happen topeople out in these here lanes. Come on. Get in. We'll give you a lift back. Well? Come on in. Be careful. [engine] You like it up here? What time will yourfriend Boots be coming back? I don't know. Is that a problem? No, no. I'll just leave the back door open for him. He can come in when he likes. Derek always says it'sone of the big advantages of living in the country. You don't have that security problem. Well, I wouldn't know about that. I've always lived in a town. [music playing] [laughter] FREDDY: I had some oncewith a fellow in the navy. Not bad. Quite good. You need more herbs? Hey, Freddy, Freddy-- take a next hit, then I want you to break dance for me. [laughter] Thank you very much. Come on, dad. Sweet dreams, Freddy. [engine] [laughter] Gobo arrives. Nothing wrong with a fewminutes of solitary peace. [inaudible] Well-- All right, Willie Boy. All right. [video game noises] You seen Yvette anywhere? Ah, no. She went for a walk. - With your friend? No, no. Errol's not with her. Don't mess me about. Excuse me, you having a drink? I'll have a whiskey-- a bottle. A whole bottle? You don't think I have the money to pay for it? [engine] [engine cuts off] Well, what do you think we should do to you? Could do anything really, couldn't we? Nobody'd hear. You won't get far. There's no one around for miles. - I'll kill you. - You'll do what? I'll kill you. OK. Who's the first to be killed? Oh, come on. This isn't all good. Let's go back. What? After all this? What do you say, Mic? I don't know. Sonny's got a point, I reckon. After all this? Why don't you give her one and we'll watch? Ah. Very funny. Drive. [engine] Do you have any cigarettes? Sorry, sir. I don't understand. I'm speaking English, aren't I? I said, do you have any cigarettes? Oh, I see. It's after hours. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you-- All right, Derek, just get me a glass. I have me own drink anyway. Could you please leave, sir? I shall have no choice but to have you ejected. Ejected? What do you think I am? A fucking rocket? [laughter] Fucking rocket. Fucking rocket. Hello there. Get off. It's Willie, isn't it? Yeah, you the guy from this morning. This morning, yes. For the-- the captain, yes! Hi. How are you doing? Hello. Yes. Yeah, well. Seeing as how I can't have a drink and I can't bum a quick smoke,just tell me one thing-- you haven't seen my daughter? I can't seem to find her anywhere. Afraid not. We've been here since, oh,eight-ish, wouldn't you say? About that, yes. What-- don't push me. Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to push you. I'm sorry. Look, get your hands offof me before I bust you one! All right, all right. I-- I'm going. I'm going. I ain't a dog. I ain't a cat. You'll have to put me out in the night. Long scotch, Albert, please. Better make that two. You fuckers. You fuckers. You fuckers. I hope you don't mind my asking, but are Pat and Louis together? Because I put them in separate rooms. No. Well, I don't think so. [clock chiming] She told me she had a four year old son. Is he the father of her child? No. I didn't mean to pry. I am. I'm the father. You're married, aren't you? Yes. Nearly two years. I have a son of my own. Do you have any children? We can't. At least, we don't think we can. Derek's having tests. Do you want one? More than anything in the world. Sorry. I just wanted some water. Sorry if I've caused you any trouble. Nah, it's nothing. You haven't caused any trouble. Do you care for him? Have you ever watched a candle go out? I can't understand why you're on your own. You're beautiful, you know? Wrong time, though. Wrong place. [cat meowing] [laughter] You dirty little fucker. I'm going to kill you! You should be locked up, man. [laughter] Sorry. Sorry. Oh, you can't stop now, Errol. [birds tweeting] I won't be long, dear. [dog panting] [snoring] Oh! [calling out] I don't remember a blasted thing. [organ music] One doesn't. Come on, Willie Boy. Ah! Will you all please stand, andwe will sing hymn number 166. [organ music] [singing] [inaudible]. So you didn't, then? He wouldn't. Do you know what these are? Letters. They're the people I live with in my dreams. You read your letters? Of course. Do you have your letters? Gas bill, electricity bill,telephone bill, rates bill. No continental communication? Not really. Only from Mildred, my wife who's back home checking out the scene. I see why you end up in graveyards. Wait, you think there's something wrong with me? I had a few drinks lastnight and I got dead drunk. Seemed like a perfectly normal way for a fellow to behave on a Saturday night. All right. Maybe I had a bit more than I would normally, but I was under pressure, man. I couldn't find my daughter any place. You don't have to justify anything to me. You sure feel as hell asmake me feel as if I have to. [clock chiming] A man who prunes his roses and misses the occasional dysentery. Remember when you were a childand you had a secret place, a place you always liked to go to, where you knew no one could find you? I used to hide in a cave in Cockushell Beach and cover the entrance with coconut leaves. I couldn't manageanything as magical as that. But I'll show you myadult, ancient equivalent. It's not actually a secret. But it serves the same purpose. Have you played snooker before? Only once. I'm not very good at it. The standard of play is irrelevant. The rules are of paramount importance. [laughter] So long as you know the rules. [organ music] Thank you very much. Bye. Bye. Good bye. Good bye. Well, I suppose if Willie Boy don't show, I better take on the captain's role. Huh. So what are we going to do without no Jeff? Captain? Seems like Jeff don't wantto be around black people any more. But even if Willie Boyshow up, we still only have nine players, you know, Rob-O. So you going to play twice, Rob-O? [laughter] [crowd conversation] Will the team players report to me first? Why don't we just dig up an old one? [engine] All present and direct. Will you hang on to this a minute, darling? [reggae music playing] RADIO: I tell you that I love you. We going to play this game or not? Maybe one of them might have seen him? I done asked already. Nobody seen him since he sitlike a pigeon in the square. So you mean we just wait? Rob-O-- Well, ready when you are. Uh, your count's a little bit short. Yes. We all fell in the puddle and shrunk. [laughter] Right. Look, there he is! Hey! Child, where you been? No where. What you mean, no where? Who you been with? I've been with nobody, dad. Nobody. Dad, I don't want to go on like this any more. We should be with mom. Please? Let's try. You could call it a holiday, if you like. We're growing apart. Growing apart? Driving each other mad. We don't even realize. And there's mom. Look, later, sweetheart. Just let me do this. We'll talk later. I promise. Morning. Morning. All right. Well let's play hard, but fair-- with passion, and with thebasics upper-most in our mind. Remember, keep your eye on the ball. It's as simple as that. Now then, how's that head, Frederick? Nothing that a couple ofpints and some swift batting can't fix. [laughter] Well, that's all I've got to say. Any contributions from you? Sonny? Mic? [loud footsteps] What happened to Jeff? Jeff disappeared. Huh? Well? We play. Hold there, sir. Sorry. Batter up! Come on! All right, all right. Now look, although we only got nine men, Willie Boy still thinks we should go ahead. Pat, you can play? No, man. We can't go so. I only asked if she can play. I don't want to play. It don't look good with a woman any how. But you ever play? I don't want to play. That's all. Why you don't ask Masie or Yvette? I don't want to play either. Masie? I'll try. - You can play. - It don't matter. She can catch a ball and throw it. The sister have a right to play. No, man. This equality shit gone too far. Boots, man. Them so come, can gonna play it. All right, listen-- I don'thave no big speech or team talk to give nor nothing. Everybody have their own idea what we doing here and if we should here on duress. But now that we here, we might as well play. And I mean, play. I don't have no time to foolaround with these people. A cricket ground ain't no place to separate the good from the bad. It's us and them. No gentlemen shit out there.We play. We win. And we gone. But mostly, we win. Fair? All right. Wicked good. Wicked. We'll bat first. All right. All right. Let's do this. Rob-O, you still feel good to go? What, you think I over the hill or what? Hey, you want to open the ball in as well? No, man. You want to hit the ballor anything in particular? Just the ball, Steadroy. Sure. [inaudible] When you get the ball, throw it to Stuart. Right. Is that all? - No. Well, I tell you as we go along. OK. Anyone know how to make up a score book? A what? I don't. Hey, man, it look as if you're going to sleep. Get right. You can't listen to music andplay cricket at the same time. I can put it by the oaks here some place. Ah, you're full of shit. Look, [inaudible] bowlinginstead of this jackass. I like bowling, you know. Yes, I know you likebowling, but don't sacrifice line and length for piece. Use your head. - All right. All right. Good. Well, I think we're just about ready. Said your prayers, vicar? Is your blokes can bowl a bit. It's only a friendly, Michael. I don't think we'll be needingto call upon the arbitrary powers of the good Lord. A nice, solid platform in thebeginning if you can manage it. No heroics, aye? Wait up, vicar-- you forgot your helmet. Helmet? [laughter] Good luck, chaps. [clapping] Morning, vicar. Morning. [bird tweeting] All right. Well, what action are you? Right arm over the wicket.

Not mess up long time. I can only count ten on them. Reckon they got hungry andate the other one last night. [laughter] [cheering] [applause] Jesus, are the trousers white? Well, we bloody keep saying them if he's going to stay out there. Come on, Will! Triple the ball, triple the ball! Don't walk on the pitch, gentlemen. Gentlemen-- Let's go! Let's go! [cheering] [laughter] Oh, God. Bugger. Woo! Get him. [laughter] Bad luck, John. Bastard. [laughter] Here we go. Who else? Give him the best, boy. Play on, PC. Is y'all forgetting the sun tan? Bad luck. Bollocks. If that's how they play, no wonder they win all the bloody time. 19 to 1 is not a bad start. Not bad at all. [cheering] [applause] [inaudible]. Looks like he's trying to rub his balls off. Sandra probably did that for him last night. Catch it, catch it, catch it! Catch it! [cheering] Yay! Someone better start pouring Derek a drink. Prat. Good work, darling. Another captain's inning from you, Derek? Not again. I did hear that they were better bowling-side than batting. You heard what? And you want some here,and you let them get pissed and run amok in our village? I don't think there's anyneed for that sort of talk, especially in front of the ladies. I quite agree. And if you don't mind mysaying, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Dad, dad, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Bar! Over! [laughter] Look, they're coming off. [applause] Brilliant team performance. Yes. Your three runs were a great help. Spread wrong. Do you want a tea break or something? Well, I think we'll have a-- Clear the round. Spread around, Snidington. [music playing] Star girl, man. star girl. All right, we going straight wrong. Now look here-- I don't want no wild ship. Just play steady and we got thisthing under control, all right? Are you two ready? Yes, man. OK, OK. Let's go, let's go. We rich as Finnish. We're richer. [laughter] [applause] Go on, Boots! Go on! Mess is up! Tell them about the Brixton posse! Back up! Back up, son. Boy, I didn't know Will could run so. No, man. He just pleased to take a nextrun over that skinny bastard. If we keep this up, we'llbe through in 40 minutes. [laughter] Nice. You see that? Yeah! [cheering] Do what you can, aye? You're our last hope. [applause] They're not bad, you know? You only made four? And the way you were standing, I was sure you were going to be stomped. So I'm not Soybers. Don't worry, man. Nobody ain't seriously vexed with you. I know that, man. But like Willie Boy, I can't stand the idea of losing to these people. [cheering] But try and get outside the old stack. Yeah. Oh, for Christ's sake-- whatis the matter with this team? We have to play with stuck up twats like you. That's what the matter. Hard luck, pal. Sorry. What did you say? OK, any argument and you'llhave to leave the field and sort it out. This bloody useless loutcan't talk to me like that. I'm sorry, Derek, but hehas to be taught a lesson. Not by a fucking poof like you. Kevin, Kevin, Kevin-- it's not worth it. WILLIE BOY: Hey, it look likea commotion of some kind. Tribal war. Come on, Snidy. [shouting] Oh, for Christ's sake. Oh, for Christ's sake, what? Well, they can walk, you know? But they'll always cheat. Who are you calling a fucking cheat? Please, please. Let's just get on with the game. Would you rather acheating bastard or I go? It was plum LBW. Oh, come on here. It's a game. That's all. Seem like pressure reached. But did the umpire give himnot out, then he's not out. How do they expect a big man like him to walk? Bastard. Out of side! I don't bloody believe it. Are they playing you? Is this when your missus triesto be nice to the darkies? Well? Is it? The rules of the game say that I determine whether or not the batters out. In this case, he's not out. Bloody hell. Are you going to play the game or what? Come on here. He's not out! Right. That's it. Hold hard, Ian. I'm on my way as well. Come along, lads. But don't you-- Look here, you can't do that. Well, if it's all right,we'll just carry on. Uh, vicar, maybe could come round a bit. Have Kevin bowl. And the rest of us justspread out as best we can. You mean to say these fellas going to carry on with just five players? What's wrong with you lot? Ah, it's your boyfriend. Won't they let you play? Piss off! Charming bunch of pigs, aren't they? [engine] Bastard. Ow. Fuck. Oh God, oh God. You think we should give hima chance, stretch it out a bit? Do what? Make a game of it. You know the thing I alwaysnotice about you is that you always shape tough for the white man, but you really don't know howto deal with them, do you? I'm just talking about making a game of it. You make me laugh. Sorry. I lost it. It's OK. I bought an extra one in the boot. I told Viv to go on and get it. It's all right. Here it is. Here it is. OK, great. Whoa. Nice one, Captain! [applause] Nice, nice, nice. I feel desperate for Derek. WILLIE BOY: How much more do we need? Just three more. STUART: Boy, it'll be the fastest since we started keeping a book. You better add four more to the score. [applause] You gonna say anything to him? No. He's busy. Lie to him. So you save your best formfor the end of the season? I couldn't think of no better time. We can go? Do we win a trophy or something? Well done, skipper. Ah, could we all possibly gather around? Marjorie would like to say afew words of congratulation. I believe we go. What now? It's all interesting, all I can say, right? [applause] Ladies and gentlemen of Snidington Cricket Club, guests, spectators-- I'd firstly like to thank all the menconcerned for a thrilling game of cricket. In the end, it mattered little who won. We were all entertained. [applause] Thank you so much forthe splendid contribution you've made. [applause] Maybe next year, we'll cometo you with a full contingent. Understand, we gonna make the bet. Everybody here? Yeah, looks like it. I mean, the least you thinkthese people could have done was to offer you a drink inthe pavilion or something. These people havedifficulties of their own. You don't think we have ours? Come on, come on. There we go. [engine] Stop worrying. You did all you possibly couldshort of actually playing. You think I shouldhave volunteered to play? [laughter] Darling, come on. [music playing] MUSIC: Somewhere in, in the night, there's a light that shinesthat only you can see. There go bright enough to blind. Your love in modern times, it always shows. They steal that passion fromkids on the eyes of love, the night up in the sky. No on can fear the reason why. They do not now be as one. It's true that some say, somesay, that's here together.
