I thought the audition's in Manila found out it's in Cebu! and I don't have a costume, you know how it is in auditions, you have to be flashy Why don't you use our Boracay money? Hon, no, we've been saving up for that for 5 months. It's okay, it'll come back to you double! What if I don't get the role? Hmm.. it's easy to save up again. What's hard is if you let the opportunity pass. If you don't use that money for your audition, I'm gonna break up with you, you'll see. Break right away?? Hello Hon? Tine: (Pretends to snore) Love you. (Fake snores) I love you more (continues snoring) Tine: Next time, it'll be you in the big screen Tine: you'll even win a BEST ACTOR award Dale: There you go again Tine: Yea! Tine: How was your audition by the way? Dale: They said they're gonna call Dale: but they're not really gonna call. Tine: They're not gonna call 'cause you think like that! You should think that they WILL call right? So it really happens. That's called Tine: Law of Attraction Dale: Law of Attraction I know that already, about that, I have a story I asked for a sign, I auditioned. I prayed. If I get the role, I will continue my dream and then? If not, then I will give up, I said. but just in time, after I prayed you entered the room Tye! Even though I didn't get the role Something better happened to me. The reason why I'm the sign that was given to you so I can push you, annoy you to have perserverance for your Dream. That's it! Alright, alright alright Agree Yea, it's true! Sorry all we do is watch movies. Don't worry, when I start making big bucks. We're gonna go on a date! In a really really nice Fine Dining. Wow! This is nice too! Watching movies. It's sweet. Don't you think? Save your money up, 'cause you'll be buying me a car On my 22nd birhday, I feel that you can afford it already You're 21.. Wait I can feel it! Wait hon, that's just in 1 year. isn't that too impossible? I think we're dreaming too high 1 year?? Law of attraction. Let's go! Hon, I need to tell you something. Ate? (big sister) WHY!?? Sorry! Mama chek spoke to me. He said I need to break up with you. But just pretend. I'll be paired with a girl as a love team to rush into fame. But this is sure, we'll have a movie. I just have to break up with you on Social Media. But, hon. this is just for the public. We're still together. Not a real break up. Who's Mama Chek? That's Dale's manager You know, if I were you. I'd say No. There are so many artists who have girlfriends but still become famous. Dale's different. Those artists are already famous. and he's gonna be launched in a love team It would look bad if people found out he has a girlfriend. Dale's just starting. What's more important to you? Your relationship Or his career? Whatever makes him happy. Oh okay.. Whatever makes him happy. then Ha-ha-ha-Happy Break Up to you! Sorry if I'm asking for too much. Hon Let's do it. Get married? No! Not yet. Not yet You know, we don't have t do it. No, no. We need to do that. That's for you. plus, it'll just be on Social media but don't hide me from your love team partner. She might fall in-love with you. Don't worry, I understand. Hon, what did I do right to have a girlfriend like you? Ate? Ate. Why are you crying? It just hurts. I know all of this is untrue It's all for show But it still hurts. Why are you crying?? 'Cause I don't understand what you're saying(English) (Singing White Flower Song) Tay Juan: Morning, anak(child) Tine: Goodmorning What are these two doing? Donnalyn? You look like Donnalyn Bartolome ate!! Hey that's not true!! My baby is way prettier than that Donnalyn! She's a grown up that looks like a 9 year old! Tye! Adeng: What now? I saw that you agreed to it already That's what you call TRUE LOVE Nay Geria: Agree to what? Tay Juan: Hey!! he didn't even ask us for your hand in marriage, you agreed already!!? Unbelievable! Nay Geria: Move here, your Tatay is so heavy. Anyway, I don't think that's right. That's not good. Yea! Kelly: It's 'cause Dale is going to be in a love team with a girl to get into mainstream show business. and it might not look good if people knew that Dale has a girlfriend. That's why Tine agreed to have a fake break up. ohh Then it will become real It's just pretend hala Your boyfriend might fall in-love with his love team partner Ate! Stop it already! Stop it! What am I gonna do!? befriend the girl! Nay Geria: Oh yes! Tay Juan: Ay! Pak na Pak!(Gay lingo for Correct) My loves what are you!? Shirly: That hurt Tine: Nay, you're splitting. Nay Geria: My loves, what are you doing. Hon! Nandito ako sa shoot mo huh? Sorry, I just miss you. Where are you? If Mama Chek sees you we're in trouble. But why!? We did what he wanted. and I'm here to meet your love-team pair. Hon, I'll just invite her to come the next time I visit you at home. Just don't come here please we will get in trouble!

You were asleep we were suddenly called for an interview Tine: what interview? Helga: this! SURPRISE! Happy birthday we love you Valentine When I grow up I want to be just like you I'm your number one fan sometimes we tend to fixate on our problems we forget that even problems have a purpose we forget about those who care for us we forget that heartaches are part of life alongside happiness and love and when something is taken from you something better will be given that's life How will you learn the true meaning of happiness without coming to know sadness? I'm Valentine Tine for short and my life is full of love just like my name.
