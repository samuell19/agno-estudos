[elevator whirring] [elevator dings] [film camera whirring] [♪♪♪] [crow cawing] [horses neighing] [grunts] Huh. Hey, little darling, what are you doing out here? I'm busy. Come on, get back in the house. I'm digging my way to China. What if I break through and a whole army of Chinamen come outta here? Hm? That'd be trouble. [crows cawing] [♪♪♪] [horses neighing] All right, you, let's go back in the house. [grunts] All right, you. All right, whoa. You stay. -[gunshot] -[horses neighing] [gun cocks] [birds squawking] This here's a whorehouse? Why yes, it is. How much you charge? First, some house rules. No guns. You will give your guns over to me, and I shall return them upon the conclusion of your business here. I do not part with my shooter. Friend, the only shooter you will need here is the one that is between your legs. TRAPPER 1: [clears throat] How much? Girls are $5, for an hour, $10 for the night. Drinks are 50 cents, meals $1 and water 50 cents. And there is also a $20 deposit. Twenty dollars? You get it back provided you do not -leave a mark on my girls. -[cow mooing in distance] Baths are 50 cents, gentlemen, and baths are mandatory. Welcome to the best little whorehouse in New Mexico. [humming] [♪♪♪] [door squeaking] Lord, but you are a beautiful woman. [groans softly] [chuckles] You might wanna try that with a customer from time to time. -[door bangs] -Next. Well, are you just gonna stand there, or are you gonna take off your clothes? Oh, shy, are we? Not like I've not seen a pecker before. Aren't you gonna change the water? [scoffs] And would that be strawberries you be wanting with your champagne? Get in. -Okay. -[water splashes] Speak nasty. Talk nasty. [loud thumping in distance] Oh, you're so big. Oh, no. No, no. That nasty Mexican talk. Oh yes, yes, yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Oh. -TRAPPER 3: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah! [grunting in distance] Take your time. I'm not going anywhere. You're not gonna tell anyone, are you? No. I'll make you a deal. Instead of me pleasing you, how about I teach you to be a great lover? Thunderation. [chuckles] Oh, damn, babe, that was fantastic. Mm, keep going. [floor creaking] [moans] Mm-hm. And just stay there for a while. -[rumbling] -[trappers screaming, laughing] All right. Let's see how we did, shall we? Tara, that is... [gunshots in distance] -Two-hundred and ten. -It's two-hundred and five. Interest, my dear. Interest, just like the bank. Would you please sign here? That is highway robbery. That's what that is. Well, I suggest you write to your congressman. You three, out. [footsteps fades] As you well know, you owe me $302 and 33 cents. Now, why don't we just take $10 off... if you get down in Frenchman right now. I might bite it off. I said French, not Mexican. Okay, $20 right now, upstairs. And watch you pull on your limp string? It's tempting. But no thanks. Try not to lick any lemons on your way out. I wouldn't want them to turn sour. [door closes] [♪♪♪] Just because you bedded a couple of sportsmen don't mean you can't clean up after yourself. That doesn't make you one of us neither! Is there a new cure for deafness? I am not the housekeeper, and that's the end of it. You bitch. ESI: [speaking Spanish] Oh you gonna read through the Bible now. Good God. -Rolling paper. -[paper tears] ENOCH: Well, wait a minute. I got something to show you. [floor thumps] Backy please. Thank you very much. Now, how much you pay for that machine? ENOCH: Two dollar. Two dollar, something. ADA: You paid $2 for a machine that rolls cigarettes? ENOCH: Yes I did. ADA: But you don't smoke. ENOCH: Ada, my dear, I may live in the present. I may remember the past. But my mind is always on the future, unlike yourself. You know, trying to have an intellectual conversation in this house is like searching for the Holy Grail. Oh. Oh, thank you very much. [sniffs] ENOCH: Enjoy a taste of the future. -[rat screeches] -[Precious screaming] What the hell? [screams] What is going on? -A rat! A rat! -What's wrong? What's wrong? For God sakes, what's all this racket? -PRECIOUS: A rat! -A rat, would somebody please just get something to shove in this woman's mouth? She's gonna bite her goddamn tongue off. You get her a pen and paper. Okay, okay. [Precious pants] Here, here. [Precious grunts, pants] [speaks Spanish] A rat. There ain't no goddamn rats in New Mexico. Voles, mice, yes, but no rats. -There are rats in New Mexico. -Oh, really? There's skunks that aren't here. Really, really, really? Yeah, where there's food there's rats. My gosh, Tara, all this time, I thought you was just a two-bit, dumb Mexican whore, but no. Turns out, you're a world expert on rats, right? Bubonic Plague. Rats spread Bubonic Plague. Great, big black boils under the armpits. They get so big they crack, weeping streams of yellow pus. So, what are you gonna do about the rats? Show me a rat, and I'll do something about it. [footsteps fades] Hezer Khaia! [crow caws] What part of our previous conversation did you not understand? Uh, uh, no. I know, I'm sorry. I was inebriated. SHERIFF: And? I made a nuisance of myself. Get back on your sorry mule and return back to the filthy hole from whence you came. I'm doing nothing wrong, Sheriff. It's not what you're doing. It's who you are. You can't help yourself. You're a wretched waste of skin. -A ne'er-do-well. -HEZER KHAIA: Ne'er what? A ne'er-do-well. I'm gonna go in there, sell my skins. I'm gonna get some supplies... then I'm leaving. Get on your fucking mule now! [gun cocks] What do you wanna do? Kill me? -[gun cocks] -Yeah. -[gunshot] -[grunts] [horse neighing] Got one. -Hundred more to go. -[all laugh] -[gunshot] -Woohoo! [chicks clucking] [gunshot in distance] Why doesn't he just put down poison? Because he's too cheap. He's gonna shoot every single one. -[all laugh] [gunshot in distance] [birds chirping] You know, life would be so much easier, Esi, if you just learned to show a little respect. [shrieks] Now why don't you be a dear and clean that up, hm? Ugh. -That's you, Martha. -I ain't touching that thing. [woods chopping] [laughs] Am I disturbing you? -Do you care? -No. What are you gonna do about our rodent problem? Fine, I'll go into town tomorrow and buy some poison. What's the matter with Esi? Is it so difficult to show just a little bit of respect? Well what goes on between you and Esi is none of my business. [clock ticking] You know, I think it's time we tightened our belts around here. I'm cutting back on the rations. No more whiskey. -[bottles clanking] -Or backey. That's it. -[gulps] -[glass thuds] Esi, can I have a word with you? Angel, can you bring this to the porch? I'll be there in a minute, okay. I want you to apologize to Enoch. Are you crazy? He's just cut our tobacco rations. [axe rattles] ESI: So? So, ease up on the man. Personally, I'd like to live in a place where nothing happens when nothing happens. Look, if that man can't have your love, he'll take your hate. -That's his problem. -No, that's our problem. He'll take whatever he can get from you, and then we end up paying for it. So, just apologize to the man and quit baiting him, for Christ sakes. You stubborn bitch. [♪♪♪] Mm, ah! -What do you say? -Thank you. -That's right. -[knock on door] -Enter. -[door opens] -ENOCH: What? -[sighs] I guess I said some things that were a little inappropriate, so... I came to apologize. What do you want? -ESI: I came to apologize. -What do you really want? I said I came to apologize. You wanna make amends, you can start by kissing me in my... [grunts, speaks Spanish] Hey, honey, you okay? Yeah? Don't worry about that. You want me to make a funny face? No? Sniffing your ear like a puppy, huh? [sniffs, laughs] -[door bangs] -[Esi cursing in Spanish] Esi, what are you doing? [speaks Spanish] Fucking. In... in English. ESI: I'm leaving. Oh, and how long do you think you're gonna last in the desert? -ESI: I'll take my chances. -You're not going anywhere. Stop your foolishness. There is kin by blood, and there's kin by kind, and you don't choose neither of them. Now, stop your bloody bellyaching and put away your fucking clothes! Oh, come here. Look... -it's a miserable fucking world. -[sobs] Don't know anyone who's happy. I don't. Come on, all better now. Come on, no need for tears. No need for tears. Where's my pendant? ESI: This is not the time. Please, get out of my room. Not until you give me my pendant. I didn't take your pinchi puta pendant. Now, get the fuck out of my room. Would you bitches stop bitching? You're working on my nerves. -She stole my fucking pendant. -She's fucking crazy. TARA: You were in my room yesterday, don't lie. Puta, I was putting your fucking towels away. Tara, are you sure you didn't mislay it? No, it was in my top drawer, and I didn't touch it. What's it look like? It's a little gold heart with a picture of June in it. I was saving it for Angel. Well, we'll look for it, and we'll find it. I promise you. Now, could you please give an old whore a bit of peace and quiet, you two? [♪♪♪] All right, you two, you are in charge, and you, you behave yourself, all right? Don't worry, I'll be back this evening, with your rat poison. [laughs] Rat poison. -[speaks indistinctly] -ANGEL: Stop. Okay, you ready? Gonna drop you. [laughs] Come on. [eagle screeching] ADA: What are you drawing, Angel? Oh, ho, that's lovely. It's beautiful. Look, Esi. That's very nice. -Ada? -ADA: Yeah? I'm thirsty. Well go on, get yourself some water. MARTHA: I'll go with you. She's a big girl now, she can get her own water. Go on. I'm bored. Would you stop your fucking complaining? It's a free country. I can complain if I want. Come here. You got it fucking easy, you do. My mother spat out a baby every year for 12 years. She dug turnips, fed pigs, and she got bent till she was near cripple. And did she fucking complain? No. -Did your daddy beat you? -ADA: Oh, for fuck sakes. My daddy never beat anybody. Well, if your Da was such a saint, how come he sold you to the highest bidder like you were a piece of meat? He without sin, Martha, he without sin. How old were you when you started? -I can't remember. -Oh, fat and stupid. Better than being old and hateful. Oh, I'll take old and hateful any fucking day, tank you very much. [chuckles] What's going on between you and Enoch? -He could be soft on you. -[Ada laughing] What? What's so funny? [laughs] I'll open the door wide for you, so you can get in, you fat cow. MARTHA: Oh, shut up, you old hag. My daddy says I'm just fine, thank you very much. [♪♪♪] [horse grunts] [slurps] How's about four coyote pelts for another round? I don't buy stolen goods. Can't steal from a dead man. [both laughs] I'll give you six pelts for another round. Now, what am I gonna do with coyote pelts, huh? You don't know nothing about fashion. See, coyote pelts... are all the rage in gay Paris. -Gay Paris? -Gay Paris. All right, you look here. Y'all want another drink, put money on the table. [horse neighing in distance] [door squeaking] -Step up. -ENOCH: Samuel. Winnie. JEREMIAH: How about it, pimpe? You wanna buy a pelt? Thank you, no. Will you stop harassing my customers, please? [indistinct chatter in distance] Now. why come every time I see you you got yourself on a different suit? From the golden days, you know that? -That and a watch. -It's more than I got. Hey, what happened to the Millwoods? Passed by their place. It's all board up. They're going down California way. That's what I reckon anyway. [laughs] All your customers are scurrying away. Huh. Screech or whiskey? Uh... screech. [coins rattling] Who's the fella hanging out front? He was a trapper. His name was, uh, Hezer Khaia. We live in unjust times. Amen to that. SAMUEL: Yep. Good God, that's horrible. So, you still scratching around your backyard looking for your magical pot of gold. ENOCH: Oh, you know I am. Tell me honestly. If there was gold out there in your backyard... wouldn't you have found it by now, and why are you the only one out there looking for it? Hm? Well the geological reasons, which are far too complex to share with a tradesman like yourself, you understand, no offense. Besides, a man's gotta keep busy. You ain't busy enough with a house full of whores? I tell you what. Why don't you take that broom, start sweeping around the bar here, because it's not as clean as I like? That's how you keep this place clean, is it? Why, Samuel, you should have notified me of your preferences long ago. I could have sorted you out down at the house. We take care of all kinds of people down there. No, sir. I have my woman right here. And all she costs me, is food. Well, if you change your mind, variety is the spice of life. I have plenty of broomsticks. You know what, keep your damn broomsticks, okay. Just give me my pipe, my slippers, and my Winnie. ENOCH: You're a very wise man. I'm very wise for not stepping foot in your brothel, sir. Well then, you are a wiser man than me. In that case, perhaps you can help me out. We are having a bit of an infestation of rats. SAMUEL: Rats. Rats, rats, okay. Let me see. Well, you, you... you don't want this, because, uh, it's a little too expensive. What you want is this right here. Two pounds of my home-cooked witch's brew. Eradicate, exterminate... eliminate. [door squeaks] It'll do the trick, I tell you that much. You gentlemen behaving yourselves? Yes, sir. Good as gold, Sheriff. Good to hear. [chair squeaks] That's it? Things have been slow. Can show you the books if you wish. I want my money. I need a few days. All right, I'll give you a few days. Notice you have been busy. Yep, you don't shoot a couple ne'er-doers unless you hang them up for display. [laughs] Here is our great arbitrator and corrector of men's behavior. Ladies behaving themselves? [smacks lips] More or less. Did you hear what happened up in Sedona? I don't get out much these days. Crazed whore stabbed a cowboy in the heart. Sounds like a song. It's not funny. Listen... I'm not trying to tell you how to run your business. But I am a student of human behavior. And I can tell you this. There's no animal, or creature, in this Earth more dangerous than a woman with larceny in her heart. Hope you get the rest of my money, Enoch. Looks like we got a sporting man. [doorbell ringing] You have to have a bath first. -Is it absolutely necessary? -Absolutely. Lukewarm, that's how I like my water. [coughs] [birds chirping] [cow mooing in distance] [♪♪♪] You. ESI: Right this way. [door opens, squeaks] [coughs] Slowly take your clothes off. [coughs] Slower. Slower. Slowly take your clothes off and tell me about the little girl. Slowly. Senor, I am sorry, I cannot do that. Why don't you go get your money back? -Take your money back. -[grunts] [indistinct screams] -ESI: Ada! -[speaks indistinctly] -Ada! -[sporting man laughs] You're kidding? You wanna fucking fight? ADA: Be nice and still, Mister. [gun cocks] Be nice and still. Get your boots, get the fuck outta here. Go on now. Back up. Back up. [door closes, opens] Where are my guns? You can come back for them tomorrow, when you get your trousers. You fucking bitch. Oh, my finger's getting mighty itchy. You papist, Irish whore cunt bitch! Get the fuck out of here, you proddy Englishman! I'll shoot you! Won't be the first time, either. Go on! [squeaking] Here, come and eat, come and eat. Quite a treat. In a witch's brew for you. I shoulda brought my gun. ADA: Here you are. Lock them up. ENOCH: How bad is she? She's bruised up pretty bad. Mostly scared. Shoulda killed him. ADA: I know. Wish I had. Ada? [♪♪♪] Tara? Did you find your pendant? No. Me neither. I looked everywhere for it. You know, it's the only picture of June that I have. What if I don't remember her face? Oh, sweetheart. You remember her. You won't forget her. Good friends are hard to forget. You know, we came out west together. Chased dreams together. And now she's dead and I'm still here. Well, now, don't fret yourself. This is the place where dreams come to die. Buried mine a long time ago. Why did you come here? Well, it wasn't by choice. Never wanted to leave Ireland. I had to leave. It's a long, sad, boring story. Ada, have you noticed that a lot of things have started to go missing around here? What do you mean? We got a thief. -Who? -Who do you think? -I have no idea. -[scoffs] It's Precious. That bitch can hear when she wants to. I'm gonna keep my eye on her. -Well, you know-- -Deaf my ass. It's not her deafness that bothers me. It's her stupidity. I swear, I've seen butter knives that are sharper than that one. [Tara laughing] I mean, who would even wanna fuck her? Well, you know, a man will pay for something -he wouldn't accept for free. -Mm. Why would anyone call her Precious? I mean, what kinda name is that? Oh no, no, no, it's Pre-Schwazay. -[laughs] -[laughs] What? That's French for thieving whore. [both laughs] [footsteps approaching] ENOCH: Here. Come on now. You gotta eat a little bit. This is the, this is the book I was telling you about. Alaska. Go on, eat up. Are you ready? "From the majestic vistas of the wilderness, incomparable in grandeur and majesty, the mountain ranges of the interior filled me with an inexplicable sense of well-being. From the heady, ice-capped slopes to the tempered plains, which by their sheer sublime beauty, can never fail to astound even the most jaded of eyes... surely the physical manifestation of the Maker's hand Himself." Esi, just imagine wrapping yourself in bear fur, fresh cold wind on your face. Not the stale cold like it is here, but fresh and invigorating, new type of cold. Esi, now it's not difficult, come on.

I'm gonna give them to you when you're grown up. And you are gonna grow up to be a fine young lady. You're gonna live in a big house all your own. And, one day, you'll meet a Prince Charming. And he'll have manners too. He'll open the door for you. He'll take off his hat when he comes into a room. Won't it be grand? And he's gonna look in your eyes, Angel. He's gonna love you. He's gonna cherish you like I cherish you, only different. One day, you and this man, you're gonna have children all your own. And you're gonna love them. You're gonna cherish them like I cherish you. And you'll grow old together with that man. And the only thing you're ever gonna hear in your house is the sound of children laughing.

Well, the sun did shine on me for a short while, when the mines were open. I heard you tried your hand at mining yourself. -I had a couple gold mines, yes. -Gold mines? That would infer there was gold in these mines. -Not in enough quantities. -[chuckles] Obviously. Who was the girl you brought with you? Oh God, the little bitch thought she could run away. Not that she's worth much, but letting her go would have set a dangerous president. Precedence, darling. Precedence, not president. Oh, whatever. Gabi, why didn't you just send somebody? This business is all about the personal touch. You can run, but you cannot hide from Madame Gabi. -Et cetera, et cetera. -[Angel giggling] Uh, we're in the middle of a meeting, -so if you don't mind. -Wait, wait, wait. Come here, darling. Don't be frightened. A pretty little thing, aren't you? -And what is your name? -Angel. A very pretty name for a very pretty girl. How old are you, Angel? Go on now, answer her. Enoch, I'm a stranger here, and Angel is shy. Aren't you, Angel? Maybe when we get to know each other a little better, you can tell me all about yourself. Would you like that? [chuckles] So would I. All right then. What a charming little girl. Is she yours? I adopted her after her mother died. -GABI: Her mother worked here? -Yes. GABI: And she's not yours? Of course not. Hm, you have such a big heart. Decorated this yourself? [smacks lips] Indeed I did. -Who is she? -Madame Gabi. She works out of Los Cruces, high-end stuff. She and Enoch go back a long way. [birds chirping] Well, since the mine's closed, we've had a bit of a dry spell, but as they say, when you're at the bottom, there is only one way to go, yes? There is no bottom. The bottom is an endless pit. Get rid of optimism. Optimism prevents one from making hard decisions. Well this is only a temporary situation, Gabi. Once I make enough money, I intend to close shop and move to Alaska, where the rivers still run cold. How much do you need? Why, are you offering to be my partner? She's even got the governor wrapped around her little finger. Were they lovers? Who knows? Lover, mother, teacher. Whatever it was, it weren't natural. No bloody wonder that the poor man's got a broke dick. What I want to know is what the hell is she doing here? -Visiting. -Visiting my arse. That woman in there is pure, undiluted evil. Evil don't visit. Don't fucking visit. 11th Commandment, thou shalt not have partners. ENOCH: Amen. GABI: I will buy her from you. ENOCH: Gabi, the girl's not for sale. GABI: In four or five years, she could be worth something. Gabi, I've-- you expect me to sell... Oh, spare me the sentimentality. How much? [♪♪♪] [inhales] I will give you $600. That's a good price. Look at it from my point of view. I wouldn't even start recouping for four or five years. I just like the sound of children around the house. The girls have become very fond of her. $800. That's my last offer. What about Precious? She's beautiful. First, she offered 600. Then she went up to 800. He told me, if he had a thousand dollars he'd close shop and move to Alaska. -No, he loves her. -Oh, love. Please, he's a pimp for Christ sakes. If he thought he'd get $1,000 for her, he'd sell her to the Black Widow herself and not miss a fucking heartbeat. We can't let him sell her. Look, I don't pretend to like the man, but even he would never do such a thing. Well, if you say so. -[birds chirping] -[door squeaks] Madame Gabi asked me to feed her. There's coffee in the house. I can guard her for you. What's your name? -Mary. -Mary. Where were you running to, Mary? Anywhere. Oh now, sh, sh, sh, there's always the next time, yeah? There's no need for tears now. Tell me something, Mary. Does Madame Gabi trade in children? Where's she keep them? In a big house, outside of town. And how many does she have? There's me, Sarah, Rebecca and four real young uns. How did you come to be in the big house, Mary? Daddy needed the money. Go on, eat up. You're gonna need your strength if you're gonna run away again.

Anhausen's masculine rejuvenator. Hm? With this box... you drink all night, still, boom boom. Your wife, she smells disgusting... [speaks indistinctly] ...like a pig, it's no problem. Headache, backache, stomach, eh, no problem. Two minutes with this machine, mm. All night. How's this rejuvenator of yours work? Ah. You, you clip... to your peepee, hm, yeah. And then, you wind it, wind it. [box whirring] -[zaps] -Huh? So, it's basically a dynamo that gives an electric charge? Uh-huh. And as everyone knows, electricity is imbued with the vital power of magnetism, which would then... which would then stimulate the muscles. Exactly. ENOCH: Now does this, does this machine only work for men, who uh-- ELIEZER: No, no, no, this is for everyone. For every man that's strong, weak, young, old. Everybody. How much do you want for it? [sighs] A machine like this, this could be good for your customers, a place like this, you could rent it out, hm? I'll give you $8. ELIEZER: [scoffs, chuckles] Eight-- I should take eight doll-- Eight dollars for my Schluppen machine? All right, 10 then. My brother is upset. He-- Six months ago, our horse Fertl, he kick him in the... [speaks German] Without the machine, he is... Can't you get another one? Yeah, in six months, could get, but I shall have to watch my brother suffer six months. So this... this really works? Two minutes. All night. All right... [clears throat] ...$15 then. [inhales, exhales] All right, fine, fine, fine, fine. Listen, listen. This is $27. This is... This is all I have. I am offering you, I'm offering you all I have. One minute. Let me, eh... [speaks German] ELIEZER: My brother, it pains me to see him like this. My poor brother. Give my brother and myself one last glorious night as men, hm? $27, women, food. Water. Hay for the horses, laundry, bath. And that box of cigars. [exhales deeply] -Hi. -Hi. Did you get a full view? What, you never seen a Jew man before? No. That's a cruel thing, they cutting off the flapper like that. I mean, what do they even do with it after they? They bury it. -Bury it. Mm-hm. -Bury it? You'd have to bury me first before I let one of those heathens touch my baby's business. You ever been with a heathen before? Well, plenty of times. -Feels queer, does it? -Well, you'll soon find out. What are you talking about? No. -No. -Yes. [chuckles] -No, Esi's taking the Jew man. -No, he's taken a shine to you. -Oh, sweet Jesus. -[laughs] What are you supposed to do? Well, you put it inside of yourself just like any penis. No, I don't wanna know, stop. ADA: It's almost exactly the same, really. -Take the laundry. -[Ada laughing] [sighs] It's nice, very nice. It's good springs. Well, I'm glad you like 'em. I've never done it with a Jew man before. Oh, don't worry. As long as you lift up my tail, everything will be fine. Do you wanna see? You don't have a tail. All Jews have tails, yeah. It's right here. It's above my ass. Oh, it's wagging. It's happy to see you. Look. [laughs] And in a full moon, I turn into a wolf. And... [sighs] That's after I've been poisoning the wells and spitting on the crosses. Anyways, you and I have lots to talk about, but first, let's shtup, hm? [♪♪♪] [box whirring] [zaps] -[grunts] -[electricity zapping] [screams] -[knocking on door] -What? MARTHA: Everything all right in there? Oh, what the? I-- Come in. -[door opens] -[grunts] Is everything all right? I heard screaming in here. Behold. That is a nice book. Not the goddamn book. Oh! All right. ENOCH: Now go on, get outta here. All right. -[door opens] -Oh, my God. -[door closes] -[sighs] ELIEZER: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. -Stop, stop, stop. -What? What's wrong? [grunts] TARA: Oh, okay. -ELIEZER: Now. -[laughs] Here, come. [grunts] -Okay, good. -Oh, God. -Oh, it's very springy. -[laughs] Yes, you like the springs, yeah. Okay, slowly, hm? Softly, slowly. -Slow. -[laughs] Take it very nice and slow, hm? [♪♪♪] [kisses] [chair creaks] [bottle clanks] [birds chirping] Hey. [donkey braying] -[horse neighing] -[birds chirping] Samuel, my friend... when is the next mail carriage due? In a couple of days. Would you be so kind? Well, another thing, would it be possible to get some store credit? How much? Couple of dollars. Enough for some tobacco, some sugar, coffee perhaps. How much for the doll? Fifty cents. Add it to the tab. -WINNIE: Anatache. -ENOCH: Anatache? What does that mean? Free, like the wind. I want my money, Enoch. ENOCH: Well I don't have it. What's this then? ENOCH: Samuel gave me credit. Damn pitiful. I want my money, and I don't care how you get it. Do you understand me? I'll be around your way soon. Don't try my patience, Enoch. [♪♪♪] [horse neighing] [bird squawking] Her name is Anatache. Anna. -Ana-tache. -Anatache. Very good. It means free like the wind. Come and get some dinner. It's ready. Oh, I'm not very hungry right now. Thank you very much. She's kinda pretty, isn't she? Are you gonna come out and eat something? I'm just not very hungry, Ada. Well, I've spent the entire day cooking, so could you at least have the courtesy of sitting at the table and having a taste? You hungry? All right, we're hungry. Okay, let's leave Anatache up here. You can come play with her later. Hoppity. [grunts] Come on. Let's get some dinner. There you go. Let's get you ready here. Oh, this looks delicious. Get up, ready, one two three, legs up. -[Ada chuckles] -There you go. Mm. Angel, would you like to lead us in grace? For what we are about to receive, may we be truly grateful, amen. -GIRLS: Amen. -Amen indeed. This looks delicious, please. Cheer up, ladies. Looks like a lovely dinner. -You made this? -Mm-hm. This looks good. Ooh, hot. [birds chirping] Mm. Go on, Angel, eat up. It's okay, you know what? We don't want you getting rickets now, walking around all bowlegged, so here, why don't you take some of mine. Enoch. Enoch, no, no, she's a big girl now. She should eat her own food. She's not a baby anymore. Did you hear that? You ain't no baby anymore. You're gonna have to start looking out for yourself now. Eat up. Mm. Well... What's the matter? Don't you like it? -I'm just not very hungry today. -You don't like it. It's very-- no, it's very good. Don't get me wrong, it's very good. Angel... you eat up, all right? We don't wanna get those rickets now. It's delicious, Ada, but thank you very much. Please, share mine. Mm. Go on. Go on inside. TARA: Was it enough? I don't know. Well he only had two frigging spoonfuls. Got rid of the rats, didn't it? Ada, what did you do? -[speaks Spanish] -Stop her. Stop her! ADA: It's done. Do you understand? It's done. Now, either you're with us or you're against us. What'll it be? [Enoch breathes heavily] [groans] [vomits] [coughs] Oh, Angel. Angel, you go now, okay? You go. You go see Precious or Ada. Just go. [grunts] [vomits] [groans] -[speaks indistinctly] -[Angel giggling] He never sleeps till 10. We can't just sit here. Someone's gotta go upstairs and see if he's alive or if he's dead or not. ESI: I'll do it. -I don't trust her. -Let her go. Won't make a difference anyhow. ESI: Enoch? It's not polite to molest a man when he's sleeping. [laughs] [inhales] Were any of you sick last night? No. ENOCH: Then it wasn't something I ate. There's something I have to tell you. Why don't you come down, whisper it in my ear, and give me a kiss while you're down here? You're fucking disgusting. [laughs] It's all part of my charm. [shovel rattling] [Enoch grunting] Oh. Aw, Angel, I don't feel so good. [coughs] But why would he buy her a doll if he was going to sell her? It's a nice going-away present. When my daddy sold me, he bought me a dress. Someone has to kill him. Are you crazy? Nice and clean, a bullet in the head. Then we have to get the keys to the cabinet. Too noisy breaking in. Give the game away. -No. -It's not like you haven't lain with every slimeball on the face of this Earth. When he's asleep, get the keys. Then one of us'll shoot him. We'll draw straws. This is gonna stop right now. There is no proof of anything, just what Martha claims she overheard. What, you calling me a liar? I told you she's not to be trusted. No. We need a backup plan. [♪♪♪] Angel, look, look, look. That's gold. That's real gold. Oh, my God. Okay, now, this is gonna be our little secret, all right? Okay? Old fool, they called me, digging in these holes. [♪♪♪] Look at that. Look at it. Now you repeat after me. To the victors go the spoils. To the victors go the pools. To the pools. Good enough, that'll do. Now, you just remember, we don't tell nobody about this. [laughs] They could kiss my ass. Kiss my ass, kiss my ass. You know what? You know what we're gonna do? New game. Filling in the hole. Now remember, we're not telling anybody about this. This is new game, filling in the hole. All right, come on, help me out. -Filling in the hole. -[debris rattles] Filling in the hole. ANGEL: Filling in the hole, filling in the hole. We don't tell nobody, right? Filling in the hole. New game, filling in the hole. ANGEL: Filling in the hole, filling in the hole. Please, ladies, ladies. What's the occasion? First a toast, a toast. To, uh, prosperity. Yes, prosperity, ladies. Please, drink up. Drink up, I have some good news. Mm, in the near future, I will be coming into a lotta money. Now, I'm not at liberty right now to say how, but suffice it to say, this money will be enough for us to move our current base of operations... to Alaska. To Alaska! You're so beautiful. I always loved you. [♪♪♪] I don't mind doing it. No. [clears throat] [gun cocks] Get up. -Esi, what the hell? -Shut up. Get out. -Esi. -Now. [♪♪♪] -[crickets chirping] -[owl hooting] [gunshot] [Esi sobbing] -[cries] -[speaks indistinctly] Here. I'll go bury him. No. No, you won't. I killed him. I'll bury him. -Trust me. -Sure. -Sweetheart. -[sobs] -Oh, sweetheart. -[sniffles] [♪♪♪] -SHERIFF: That's a girl, Sugar. -[horse neighing] Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Is Enoch here? No, he's gone away. Do you know where he went? Went away on business. Said he'd be gone for two weeks. Can I help you with anything? You tell him when he gets back that I'm looking for him. -ADA: Will do. -You have yourself a nice day. [birds chirping] ADA: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. He knows. Shit. Well, one thing's for certain. We can't sit around here. Let's go. What the fuck is she wearing? What I tell you? Food and water, that's all. -Oh Jesus, Martha. -What the fuck are you wearing? What are you wearing? Well you never know who you're gonna meet -on trips like this. -Oh, good God. -Jesus, Martha. -God. Dios, mio. You okay, Angel? -I want Papa. -I know, sweetheart. Hey, everything's gonna be just fine, okay? Just fine. Now, where the... where the hell is Precious? Oh for Christ sakes, someone shoulda smothered that one at birth, saved us the trouble. Precious! Precious! All right. -You go-- -That's great. Real helpful. You go on inside, look for her. Go upstairs. -I'll look around here. -All right. -I'll check the barn. -We don't have time for this. All right, here. Samuel, go get your shotgun and saddle up your horses. A crazy whore has killed Enoch. Elijah, you guys get you some horses too. Let's go. Uh, I'm Jeremiah. Whatever, Jeremiah. Get your goddamn horse. You want us to bring the rope too? How the hell you gonna hang whores if you don't have a rope? Get a gun. [♪♪♪] Okay. We can't wait any longer. We gotta go. All right, don't worry, I'll find her. No, Martha. Are you sure? I can't leave her. I love you, Ada. -[speaks foreign language] -All right, go on now. All right. You good? You good up there? Yeah, you can do it, Angel. We got a little ways to go now. It's an adventure, isn't it? Gonna be great. [horses neighing] [♪♪♪] [horses neighing] This is Sheriff Amshell. Come down. Hm. You want me to go up there and get her? No, the time for niceties are over. This is Sheriff Amshell. Come down. You're wanted for questioning. [♪♪♪] If you don't come down, I'm gonna shoot. -[gunshot] -[grunts] Jezebel, you can come out now. Well there you are. Now, I am going to ask you a question. And you're going to give me an answer. You understand? Where have the women gone? I take it by your silence that you don't want to tell me. But I will ask you again. Where have the women gone? I'll tell you nothing. Is that right? I have nothing to say. [gunshot] Good night, young lady. [door bangs] Ah, ah! Thank God. SHERIFF: Oh, what do we have here? Oh, Sheriff! Huh, all trussled up like a little piggy, huh? -[Enoch grunts] -What happened to you? Thank God, thank God. You gotta untie me, come on. Huh. What's the hurry? I'm kinda enjoying this. [chuckles] You're all naked and hogtied, and I don't know. Boys, don't come in here! This could be our private moment. You owe me money. Maybe I'll just leave you here, huh? All right, all right. I found it. SHERIFF: Found what? -Hm? -The gold. SHERIFF: Yeah, right. I found the gold, Sheriff. I'm telling the truth. SHERIFF: And where is this gold? Don't hold out on me. Let me know. Hm? Where is this? ENOCH: Under the goddamn porch. Who have you told? ENOCH: No one. I'll give you 20% if you untie me. I swear to God, Sheriff, please. You're a habitual liar. The problem is that nobody believes you when you're a habitual liar because even when you are telling the truth, nobody, nobody's gonna believe you. I swear to God it is. You've gotta believe me! I found it, I'm not lying. It's the truth. Look, I'll give you 20%. You just cut me loose and I'll give you 20%. It's a mother lode, Sheriff. [horses neighing in distance] -Funny. -It's amazing. It's a huge vein. -SHERIFF: I believe you. -What? I said it's funny, I believe you. [gunshot] What happened? Enoch pulled a gun on me. Imagine that? No one pulls a gun on me. -What, so you killed him? -I shot him. It'll take him a while to bleed out, ponder his life and make amends with the Lord, I figure. [birds chirping] [grunts] [♪♪♪] TARA: We gave up on the hat. I don't wanna be on the horse anymore. I wanna go home. I know, darling. We can't go home, okay? There you go. [exhales] You know, they are gonna catch up to us. We're all gonna hang. We gotta split up. We'll take the high ridge. Are there tracks up? Yeah. We'll meet her there? If we survive. Esi, no arguments now. I want you to ride like the wind. We gotta split up. Go, get us some horses, get us some help. Give me the rifle, go on. Right. Hey, wait for the child. Where you going? What the fuck? Well, I guess it's us now. Fucking bitch. I was told that when I was born, my mother could not produce enough breast milk. So a nursemaid was hired. A big, large mammy. So you could say my first taste of nourishment was from the breast of a Negress. Strange connections in this world, Samuel. Here, let me help you. Okay? Oh, my God. -Oh, my God. -ADA: What? TARA: Guess Enoch did find gold. Oh my God. ADA: Well, there's no turning back now. -[♪♪♪] -[wind blowing] Guess it's just us. Guess it is. Guess it always was. -Come here, Angel. -Come here, Angel. Got some things to teach you. Here. We're gonna teach you how to shoot a gun. We're gonna teach you how to shoot a gun, that's right. [laughs] Is that that Mexican whore on that white gelding? Sure enough looks like her. Maybe we should make sure it's her. -[gunshot] -[Esi thuds] [eagle screeching] Whoa, whoa. I thought you said I could fuck them first. SHERIFF: Shut the fuck up. Where the fuck's your brother? I don't, I don't know. SHERIFF: Jesus Christ, get the fuck over here. What the fuck is the matter with you, huh? I don't know. I'm sorry, Sheriff. Right, now, get your shit together. ADA: Angel, get down, get down. Don't get up, no matter what. -[gunshot] -Motherfucker's dead. [gunshot] This here's Samuel. Why don't you just let me go my way, and I'll let you go yours. I don't want no trouble. Yeah, why would we do that? -[horse neighing] -Amshell's dead! What the hell more do you want? Look, I've had enough of this bullshit! I have a shop to run! And a wife whose wrath is just as deadly as your bullet. I'll put this gun down! Right here. I'm putting my hands up. I'm just gonna walk the fuck away. Now, you can go ahead and shoot me in the back if you want. But I've had it! Good luck to you, ladies! All right. Thanks, Samuel! Now, you go and you never come back here. If you'll excuse me, I got someplace I gotta be, and I don't got a lotta time. Mommy, Mommy! Mommy, Mommy! [♪♪♪] [dog barking in distance] Where are we? Is this, Mexico? Si signora, Mexico. We're free. We're fucking free. -We did it. -[both laughs] [ Polvo de Oro playing] [♪♪♪]
