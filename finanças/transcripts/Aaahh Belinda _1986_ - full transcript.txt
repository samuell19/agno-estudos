What if I notice the hair, as I look at the food? No, only the hair. Nothing else takes your notice. She has come over to the table, she's about to serve the dishes. What's the dish? Hello dear.

What can she do at this point? Follow her mother's steps. Whether she likes it or not. She'll be forced to sleep with strangers. She couldn't endure. Maybe death is better than a life like this. Some see dying as a means for a relief. But only Asiye can decide that. True. We can't tell anyone to choose death over life. But I can't accept it! I can't accept that a woman can sleep with a man in exchange for money. I just can't. Hi. Did they start? - Already. My watch's broken! At first I couldn’t tolerate, sleeping with a stranger. Looked for an easier way. Started flirting with college students at cafes and pastries. It wasn't too bad. Sometimes they hugged and caressed.

We've spent our lives together in this house! We've been through some tough times but I've always loved you dearly! You are shivering. Are you cold? Give me your hand. I hope I will never see the day, that you take this ring off again. Please leave me alone and go to bed. I get it you are stressed. You can sleep alone if you wish. I'll just crash on the couch. Except, I have a request. The kids, Please kiss them good night. They are used to it. I won't wash. Still here. Something is amiss. My name is Serap. Serap. Just hold on. You'll get through this. I'm not crazy. Are you alright Naciye? I am. Is it over? Yes. Don't stay so far from me. You work don't you? You'll be late to work! It's still early. Come now let's... The kids! Hakan, Inci! Mom my uniform is missing! He too my color pencils! Liar! You are the liar! Go inside and find your uniform. Aren't running a bit late? Do I work? Right of course. Mrs. Naciye works at a bank. Which bank? Naciye. Maybe you should take the day off? And me too, we can go for a trip. Please Mr. Hulusi. Or maybe we should go see a doctor? Please my dear, go to work. I'm fine, honest. Mommy let me kiss! Mommy me too! Goodbye Naciye. Please take care of yourself. Girl get a move on! We will be late. What a mess, you didn't even clean up. I'll get to it later. To the bank right? Where else? Good grief... Come on already! Sign here please. Right there. Mrs. Naciye, this isn't your signature. This is the best I can do. Excuse me? Never mind. I'm a bit off today. But don't worry, I'll get better soon. As soon as possible... Mine is even worse than your mother in law. At least Mrs. Nedret doesn't talk to you anymore. Nedret... She doesn't talk to me? Oh, did you two make up? No... It's better this way. I really don't want to go home. Clean up, do the dishes, put the kids to the bed, make the dinner. And then please Mr. Osman. I can't do this. What can't you do? Can you lend me some money. How much? - Doesn't matter. Will this do? I'll pay you back asap. Did I upset you? It's not what you think. Please, I feel responsible. Come for a coffee? I'll pay a visit later, ciao! Ciao? Where's my mother? She had some work. I've told you. What work? At the bank. But what work? What do they do at a bank? What? Whatever the heck! Just eat your food! I won't eat! Please. You've spilled food! Get t-that off. Your food. That's enough! Go to your room! But the commercials are on! Quick, beat it! Get going! What?! Garbage. -No garbage! Hulusi, what a surprise. Please come in. Long time no see, come in. Let me. Where is Naciye? Really, why didn't she come? You know, kids and all. She's a bit tired. Stressed. That's the trend nowadays, every women is stressed. Welcome Hulusi. Thanks. Would you like a cup of coffee? I'll be heading out soon. Why did you even come then? Isn't that right! Keep your hands... Naciye was really tired. She was really off today. How so? Talking all weird, she couldn't even sign her name! And what happened then? What do you mean? You left the bank together. I mean, did she tell you anything? Oh you mean that. Come on now. Are you angry about that? It's nothing! What's nothing? What are you going on about? I gave her some money. Did she tell you that? Money? She did? Didn't she tell? I mean she did... That's enough, what money? I'll pay you back right now. Please, I can't accept Looks like I didn't have any. Anyway... What's up? Nothing, just... What? I bid you good night. What the hell is going on with you two? Drop it! She really was acting strange. Like a sleepwalker. She asked for some money and didn't go to her home! Maybe she didn't come back at all? You can't get a word out of him! Bla Bla Bla! Go to bed! I fully get your perspective, doctor. And that's totally reasonable. I don't get it either. But I can give you some clues. Suddenly, I have found myself married to this guy. The people I knew, my friends. They didn't recognize me! Please listen. You will think I'm paranoid. Forget that you are a doctor. And try to believe me. I believe every word you said. Where did this "paranoid" stuff come from? We are not trying to label anyone who comes here. Please tell me, how did arrive at this point? We were shooting an ad. The life I have now was the background for my character. Mrs. Naciye, Mr. Hulusi and their kids, Hakan and Inci. A nightmare. I'm a stage actor. I've dedicated myself to art! Working at a bank... I don't even go to banks! Suat does it for me. Excuse me. Who is Suat? My friend. We live together, he also works at a theater. And... does he know about this? He is not related to anything whatsoever! That's what I've been telling. You don't believe anything I've said. But... - Admit it! You think I'm Mr. Hulusi's wife, Mrs. Naciye. Because... - Because? Okay. Bring in my would be husband and ask him. Does Mrs. Naciye have any acting skills? Any interest in musicals? Any talents like that? Please ask him. Maybe we should not bring Mr. Hulusi into our discussion just yet. Let's do it. Bring everyone in so they can witness. Okay doctor. This bit is from "Who Can Save Asiye?" We are still rehearsing it. You might be familiar with the older renditions. I've seen it before. I'm ready. That's right Mr. You're right it isn't easy.

I know so much about you. Your father is a trader. Your mother likes playing cards. She's frequenting the casino at Macka Hotel. Your interest in the theater started in high school. Your first play was The Victim. That's enough I understand. You are a secret agent. But which agency? You had one cavity filled on your top left wisdom tooth. And a large mole on your back. Women are scary. You probably know someone close to me. But, where does your interest come from? Suat. Don't you recognize me? Seriously, you don't? I don't know. Maybe long ago... Years ago. You really turned my life upside down. I've been thinking about you. Who is she, where does she come from... I feel like I've always known you. But something happened and I forgot. I've missed you. It's as if your face is seared into my mind that day. On that day you came, you really did know me. You were seeing through me. Suat. Yes my dear? How many times we've made love? Yes my dear. You were always within me. My beautiful baby. You recognize me. Call me Serap. I recognize you Serap. You are beautiful. I know all about you! Know me. Know all. Look at my face. All about you... You are so beautiful. Suat. Yes? Who am I? You are my girlfriend. What is my name. Serap, wasn't it? You sleep with anyone you come across? Me? I'm not making sense. So it has come to this, I'm jealous of myself. Can you go outside, I'll put on some clothes. I can't find a single clue about the life I had. Destroyed. Disintegrated. Would you like a cup of coffee? Might as well. Alright then make it. You know the house anyway. Listen. To me, the theater is the only thing that matters. Don't get me wrong, I like you. Or get me wrong I don't care just help me.

Can you at least turn it down a notch? No! Alright, come to table. Masallah! What is this? Beef fillet. Beef fillet. Hurray! I don't want beef fillet! Turn of the TV! That's too much, one slice is enough, And some vegetables. No fat on this meat? It's boiled. Little butter afterwards. Butter? Pass me the salt. Eat some bread. You are not eating? Maybe you could have cooked some pasta. We would all have our fill. Eat more bread. Be careful. How much did you buy? If only there was some pasta. Pasta. With side order of borek. Bread. Imambayildi with extra onions. Rice and beans. My god. I'll gain 100 kilos in this house. I don't want pasta, I want more meat! Eat dirt! Finish your pasta first. Congratulations, you've spilt on me. Laundry is piling up. Do we get domestic help? What? A maid or something. There you go. Why'd you hit me! What maid? Are you trying to kill us? Don't cry my love. My baby. Your father's a bit on the edge. Come here my sweet girl. I'll kill him! Kill that dummy! Look at me. Let's wipe those tears away. I think I've made your father angry. I only like you mommy not him! Well that's not nice, he's your father. What am I thinking? Alright that's enough now. Piggyback! Piggyback ride! Mommy! Daddy! You know, you come across as a bit weird sometimes. Yes. I remember that time you were insisting on a new set of furniture. Furniture? We still have the mortgage payments, we can't afford stuff like, You know. beef fillets or maids. Don't you worry Hulusi, no more beef fillet. Yeah, who wants it anyway. No more banana. Sure why not. Everyday the kids will have pasta, lentils and stuff like that. They can eat bananas when they are older. You don't really like light do you? I don't like being wasteful. You're right. We are screwed. According to the doctor, I can return to the play in two months, if the operation is successful. Looks like, we either find a new Seniye, or wait until next year. It's not my fault is it? I got sick. Actors should take care of themselves. Drinking in the night, waking up sweaty. What's drinking got to do with it? Ayten seriously, one doesn't get ill for no reason. Tarik, wasn't she at the bar that night? Here we go. Greetings. This is Serap. Hello. Please, sit. She knows about you. She is crazy about theater. It shows really. We've run into each other before right? At the bar. Regretfully, that was an unpleasant encounter. She's here because you know, since Ayten is no longer... for the play. Ms. Serap claims to know the play by heart. Maybe you can give her a chance. And maybe, I mean, why not? Actually I was preparing for the role of Asiye. But it's fine, I'm ready for a try out. Gotta love it! How long have you been working in this institution? 14 years. That's a long time. Could you tell me, when did this interest first arise? Women often are interested in these areas. Are you surprised? This interest, might exceed your expectations. Nowadays, a lot... Nowadays, a lot of women and girls phones brothels. Just to talk to these pitiful girls. She memorized the entire play, is she insane? That's news to me. Let me tell you how it all began. I was at Paris, with my- Ms. Serap, you got the part. Please, let's have a chat. You have blown me away! She looks perfect, huh? You should have been an actor, for real! And you a housewife. Monday rehearsal is at 6. That is, 6 PM? Is there a problem? No, it's fine. Just a little longer, we're almost there. Mommy, I have to pee! Mommy, I'm tired. See right there, there's a good spot. There's no shade there! It doesn't matter, I'm done walking. Whose idea was this picnic anyway. It's you who always wants to picnic! These dolmas are all burst open! Sorry, it's my first time. That's not what I mean, It's probably because of the car.

Be considerate! we're all waiting for you to fill that huge drum! I've been waiting for hours, you are being rude. This is the real deal right here! Mom is coming.

It's not even important but... Maybe you can help me. Goddamn donkeys! But once they on top you... Whoa easy, there's family around. Mrs. Naciye what's up? What? Drinking raki? I don't drink? Well if you like it, enjoy! Let me see! Go ahead. Cheers, eh? I've been doing something. What? Mom! Nobody wants to play with me! Inci! We don't want to play, we're skipping rope! But they always skip rope! Why should we care? Goal! Damn you! That that, do you like that? Calm down, don't you see the kids? My ball! Naciye, let the kid take a pee. I can always go back to the asylum... You couldn't get a word in, come on now talk! I have friends. From the theater. Theater? But mom, you're not looking! I'm looking. Damn girl, what's he like? Is he handsome? It's not like that. Mom why'd you let go of the rope? Get outta here you little... You can be honest with me, go on. Mom you are the goal keeper! Get outta here! Listen. It's not like that, I've a part in a play. As an actor, I'm going to rehearsals. What? And there's one at 6 PM tomorrow. Can you help me? So you are a stage actor now? Even if I can cover for tomorrow what will happen later? I will have to tell Hulusi at some point. Alright. Let's say I've been gifted two tickets for a play. Osman hates theater anyway. I'll tell him we're going to see a play. And Hulusi? Mommy, why did you leave us? Now write. We go to a picnic when spring arrives. How is the drawing going Inci? Almost done. Hulusi, can your parents come at a later date? I gave my word to Feride, to go to a play. It would break her heart if I don't show up. What about my parents? It's Feride's turn now. If only you've told me earlier. Woman don't make me mad. Now my parents are a burden? If it wasn't for them, who knows what would be doing. Do it in the toilet! You went crazy anyway, we've been together for years. You made mom sad! Can't even watch the news. Mommy, I love you so much! Okay. I've missed you so much! It has been long enough! Stop! Don't! Okay I'll tell my parents not to come. Please, stop! Let's go to our bed. Hold on! Stop! I'm a man after all. One week. Please wait for one more week. Okay? I don't understand what's going on. But I'm warning you, I'm getting sick of this! I can't believe this. So you'll be up there acting? I'm more excited than you! Are you not trembling? Listen to me, my name is Serap. Don't call me Naciye in there. Girl, you are the devil! Take this and straight to bed. But. - Take it. But you don't know what kind of a person I am. Lock the door and sleep with peace. You can wear my Aunt's clothes. They are in the closet. Deal? Deal. You are so nice. I wish you good night. You too. There are such nice people around, huh? Lights. And what's next? The guy gets Asiye a place. And starts looking for a job. And slowly love is formed between them. They truly love each other. And after a while they start living together. Excuse me, I don't get it. What do you mean, living together? Does he take her as a mistress? Will they get married? - You could say that. But they truly love each other. Congratulations Mr. Suat, you were brilliant! Thanks. This is new, we're getting praises before the actual play. Probably nothing new for you. I'm famished. Let's go to that soup place. What a good idea, we didn't eat anything. Except, you don't mind us, do you? Don't mention it, it's my pleasure. Are you insane, our husbands are waiting! Screw them! Let them wait, can't we have a fun night? Is it far away? ...a fun night. Father? Did something happen to mother? She's fine. Nothing can happen to that woman. And? And I'm sick of her. I'm not returning to that house. You can either send me to a nursing home. or... But I don't want to impose. I won't hear it! But what happened? Bitching all day! "Why didn't they accept us?" What's this? Expecting a guest? A guest? No. Maybe I had a feeling you would come. What am I gonna do now, rehearsal is at 8 PM tomorrow. What about an annual dinner at the bank? They will be onto us. Maybe the best is to tell Hulusi. No, Osman would kill me. Don't worry we'll handle it. Okay, good night. Ciao! It's me Naciye don't scream. Who are you! It's me Hulusi. Who's sleeping on the couch? - My father. What's he doing here? Long story. Now, I won't take no for an answer. It was auspicious that my dad showed up. My love. No! Hang on a minute! Mommy why did you scream? Because donkey's ass! Hakan, are you alright? You are cold! Let your mommy warm you. He's a grown man now what's he doing here? He's afraid, daddy. What the? Your feet are all cold! Let's go to sleep. Mommy I love you so much. Me too my little baby. Don't touch my mother! Beat it you bastard! Hulusi, I mean really. You are so selfish! You don't understand children. Hulusi, this is very difficult for me. I've been thinking a lot, I can't go on like this. We have been through a lot, as you put it. Please respect my decision. And don't look for me. Goodbye. Mother listen to yourself! After 45 years of marriage. It's not my fault! Listen to me, unless he apologizes... Suddenly, a giant popped out of the well, and said, what do you wish from me! I only want my basket back. Take this chicken and go home! But never ask for eggs! Your mom is here. But the story! Grandma! Calm down you two! You talk with your grandchildren, I'll go change. Grandma what did you get us? Alright slow down! This is for you. And this is for you. Grandpa slept here yesterday. I have nothing to say to you. Likewise. And so? You came to me. This is my son's house. Same here. So weird. So weird! I'm not talking to you! See how you influence the kids! It's you who influences them! Naciye left. What do you except, like father like daughter. What's going on? I'm running late, I'll serve the food. But I have to leave now, she's waiting. Who is waiting? I've told you last night. The annual dinner that I'm going with Naciye. Are you having me on? What dinner? I've told you last night. In the middle of night, running your mouth, I was already sleeping! Well now you know. My dear, come eat your dinner. And you can clean up afterwards. You don't need to hurry because you are not leaving! Osman listen. Don't bother. I am leaving and that's it. They are expecting me. Stop! I've had it with you! Do you have any idea how other women live? I've wasted my youth for you! She pretends to be insane and becomes an actor! Here I am working my ass off day and night and this is what I get? I want to live! Who's this actor? Are you screwing with me? Daddy stop! It's no use to hide it now. Naciye left the house. Did she come to the bank today? Speak now or else! Madam please, this is the final rehearsal. I'm a teacher I know my way around the theater! Please, I beg you. You know how many students I had like you? Stay out of my way! ♪a mark on our face. for the likes of us. Love is money, a wound in our heart. a mark on our face. for the likes of us.♪ My god! Let's wait for the play to end. ...for accepting our invitation and joining the controversial play; Who Can Save Asiye. We welcome our dear guest. Director of Anti Prostitution Organization With regards, Semiye Gumus. Director of Organization! You are clueless Hulusi! ...we thank her on behalf of our theater. So this is the dinner? How long have you been working for this institution? For 14 years. 14? Lies! This is too much! Too much? You dirty, ungrateful woman! Leave her alone you pig! Call the police, this guy is insane! What? I'm the one who is insane? Be my guest, call the police! I'm about to kidnap my lawfully wedded wife! Please go ahead. What's he saying, what wife? Suat hold on. Please Mr. calm down. How are you related to Ms. Serap. Get a load of this guy. She's insane! She has fooled you sir she's the mother of my children! And her name isn't Serap, it's Naciye! Your wife. Naciye. She is standing right there! Is this true? Suat, don't leave me alone with him! For god's sake! Goddamn you! You are going to play this part! Let me go! I won't return to that house! Who is letting you in anyway? You are going back to your father's! You are not a worthy mother! My mother is right. You are going to your father's. I have a father? Tell him I said hi, his daughter worthy to his legacy! Don't look at me like that, this is what you wanted. My home... ruined. Mr. Firuz? Yes, how can I help you? You don't recognize me. Oh, my baby! My daughter! My god. What can I tell you. I'm a terrible father. I have neglected my responsibilities. Don't say that. It's true. I've left you all alone, among strangers. I would have wanted to make a worthy father to you but I have failed. That woman, seduced me. Which woman, sir? That woman. When I left your mother for that woman, I was in a dark place. All I asked for was some tolerance. Please, don't be like this. How is Nedret? does she ever mention me? My mother in law? I suppose she's fine. Hulusi was a fine boy, I liked him. But it was Nedret who prohibited you from seeing me. I am still hearing her voice. "That man who left his wife for a slut, can't come near us. He can take his daughter if he wants!" I was listening from the other room. Inci was just born and Hakan was one year old. I've missed them so much, you can't even imagine. All I had was some photos. Come with me. Now that you have returned, this is over for me. Hear me god! I repent! You have shown me my daughter again! It is over! Hear me god! Excuse me sir, maybe you shouldn't be so loud. Your uncle took this the year you were born. I've always wanted to tear this one apart! Now I'm removing this dark stain from my life! It's almost dawn. Sun is rising! A sun is rising into my life! What is it? Let's go to your mother. I have a mother too? To the cemetery, she's waiting for us Naciye. Saheste... we're here my beloved wife. I've betrayed you but please find it in your heart to forgive me. I've brought Naciye to you! For the sake of our child, forgive me! Mother please, for my sake, forgive him. He has been through a lot. Forgive him, so we can go to sleep. And you forgive me Naciye. Hulusi! My son. - Father. You are calling me "father"! Yes, I am. Let me kiss your hand. And you too, forgive us for our intolerance. My god. Thank you. I can die in peace now! No father, you will live. With your daughter and your grand kids! Enough! I've had enough! I can't stand this any longer! Okay! Naciye my love, mother of my children. It's over now. No more crying, only happiness from now on. Wipe those tears away. Embrace the happiness! It's over now. Everything is over! There will only be happiness. Only Naciye. Get five onions, and slice them in half circles. And season them with a little salt. Afterwards, take three peeled tomatoes. Remove the seeds. 14 cloves of garlic. And a bit of parsley, finely sliced. Add two pinches of salt, mix them up real good. And the eggplants, split in four. Well, you can also fry them in oil. But if you work with raw ingredients, the Imambayildi will be fresh and delicious. Thank you my dear. Great food my girl. Well, It's not too bad. Osman be a little more careful. Please Feride don't. Turn that frown upside down. An angry wife is like muddy water. Nobody wants to drink it, even if they are dying of thirst. Alright now Hakan, Inci! Wash your hands and then go to bed! Wash that greasy mouth or rats will chew on it. You hear your grandma? Wash your mouth well or rats will chew on it! Thank you my lord. Thank you my lord. Thank you my lord. Cheers. Thank you sir. Anyway, it's all over now. ♪Once upon a time. There once was a Boogeyman. It takes the little kids away. Throws them in his cage. And does the Boogie Woogie! Boogie Woogie!♪ Good night. Hulusi...
