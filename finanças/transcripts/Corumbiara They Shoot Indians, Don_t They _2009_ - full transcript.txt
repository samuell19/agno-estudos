My name is Vincent, I work on indigenous advocacy, and I began making documentaries in 1986. In this year I was engaged in the first experience of Video in the Villages, which back then consisted in filming the Indians and showing it back. This mirror-play generated enthusiam, and with the possibility of seeing themselves in the little screen, the nambiquara are thrilled, and us with them. And suddenly, under the leadership of Pedro Mãmãindê, they pierced the lips of 30 young men in a ceremony abandoned for more than 20 years. From this remarkable experience "The girls' celebration" was born, my first documentary, in the north of Mato Grosso. That's when Marcelo Santos, an indigenist from FUNAI, asked me to record the remains of a massacre of isolated Indians, in the Corumbiara glebe, in the south of Rondônia. I was beginning my career and the possibility of using video in a militant way was what mattered. And for Marcelo, who had fallen into discredit because no one cared about some massacre story this was the last opportunity to record the evidences that would soon disappear. THE Y SHOOT IND IANS, don 't they? The south of Rondônia is the new expansion front. The Corumbiara glebe, best land of the region, was auctioned by the military government in the end of 60's. To entrepreneurs from São Paulo. Members of the same family, each bid for a tract. And thus the latifundia are formed. The government spent more demarcating the properties than it charged for the land. The landowners made more money selling timber than they payed for the properties. And there we go, to the Yvypitã farm, where the events took place. - You mean that this road was built only so the tractor would pass... - It was the conclusion of the federal police chief, that this road was built with the sole purpose of destroying the Indians' camp and their fields. Look here, you see this, man, it's annatto! Annatto from their camp. All of this is annatto. Look... that pile of wood over there is what's left of the camp site. The other houses we found were in the fields After they suffered an attack they camped here. The fields were farther ahead. So, they found them, and used the tractor to clean what was here. This is where the 38 mm bullets were found. Pedro found two bullets right over here. That's what's left of their houses. - Look here. - I saw it, an axe helve. It's their axe. It's damn rough. Look, a piece of a pot. Their house was here, because it's full of their stuff. Papaya is growing... - Let me see that pot. - I' m going to put it with that other one. - Is it clay? - It's clay. You know that a committee from FUNAI was here, and there is an official report written by Possuelo stating that he did not find any evidence in here. The president of FUNAI in Brasília has this report. - He sent back to me, this report. - So... - And about the report, he says there are many evidences. - Well... now... then there you have it: One team comes and says there aren't, another one comes and says there are... - Proves that there are! - The Indian that's in there, the one you forced away, is the Indian I am looking for. The boss of the farm isn't looking at all. I am the one really looking for this Indian. - This makes no sense: Taking money that would do a lot better in the south, and investing it here to come and kill Indians! Then having you close down an area like this, Marcelo. Try to act consciously, Marcelo! "Act consciously" is you going up to an Indian field, bulldozing it and we finding a bunch of bullets over the Indians' houses. - They found one bullet shell... - They found cartridges! It's all stored. ...you can go to my truck and... - The federal police sheriff was very clear in his statement about the fact that a road was opened up to the Indians' fields with the sole intent of bulldozing them. - Mr. Rivaldo stated it clearly... - But do you know what I said to Aymorê concerning this... - I said it and repeat it to you... The filming of the evidences was then interrupted with us getting kicked out of the area by Mr. Flauzino, the landowners's lawyer. We moved things around for the scenary Scenary?! Now we only need to place the victim over there... 20 years later I come to Goiânia, to meet Marcelo, and finish the film about the massacre of isolated Indians. Son of a bitch! - Are those documents in chronological order? - It's in mess-o-Iogical order. What chronological order!? I haven't opened this in centuries, man. All this paper... - Yes, I though that maybe this dossier could help us remember. This is what Virgínia did to demarcate the area. Despite the evidences we found in 86, FUNAI reopened the area. Marcelo was prohibited of going back to the region and no further investigation took place. We found this bow in the field too, under the tree that the bulldozer pushed. All that's left is a piece of the house. - Is this a pestle? - It's a pestle. This year, the farmers cleared the area using hundreds of workers. But from the airplane we could see the Indians' field insisting to grow. Sydney Possuelo FUNAI's officer The Indian is obviously no longer where they fell down the trees. If he is there, he will be where patches of intact forest remain, So, I explored all this area of intact forests and I didn't find any trace. I found absolutely nothing. I concluded my report stating that clearly an indigenous group lived until recently inside the closed area. But that due to the intense process of colonization they were pushed out and had left that area. It's no use for you to say that there are Indians. "Where?" Aymoré head of FUNAI in Rondônia ...Arrows, all this stuff, and they will tell you it's rubber tappers, or that someone bought it wherever... All of this he said to us. It's not the case, we know these are genuine arrows. All that stuff, there's no way, Just that, I think, was enough to do something. But in a region like that, it's no use... Usually, when something like this happens the Indian is systematically pursued. There's no doubt about it. If you don't interfere, as a lesser evil, they really will kill the Indian in there. And this might have happened. So, all of this is hypothetical. It is possible. But, that an Indian lived there, there is absolutely no doubt. That FUNAI has known that for many years, and that no one acted on it... Everybody knows that no one took measures. Now, unless these Indians are found, we won't be able to do anything, that's the truth. It's no use for me to say that they killed, that such and such happened, or that someone did this etc... I' II be just... dreaming about it. Because I can't prove anything. What matters is this: We have to find these Indians, and then, the entire story can be retraced. This story would have died here, if we weren't certain that the Indians existed. That's Peroba, a little Mahogany there... But that white one in the middle I don't know. This is Cherry tree, that one I don't know... Nine years after our expulsion, Marcelo is appointed as head of Isolated Indians in Rondônia. The Polonoroeste Project, a loan from World Bank, required actions to alleviate the impacts of development. One of these, to our luck, was the program for the protection of isolated Indians. Pedro Mãmãindê is no longer among us. He was murdered by his own son-in-law at point-blank for never having allowed the sale of timber from his reservation. Marcelo officially resumes the search, now with judicial support and with the help of the federal police. The farms that always denied access are the first ones to be visited. "...the federal Attorney General's Office filed public civil action, with the request of action against Joaquim Fontes and others... ...for not having allowed the entrance of FUNAI officials in their properties so that studies on the likely existence of indigenous groups in the areas still unexplored may be carried out. Before the matter presented, I grant the demanded injunction, bidding the defendant to consent to the access of FUNAI officials to their properties so that they may have access to the primeval forest as well as to the legal forest reservation." In nine years the deforesting was brutal. A little red dot in the satellite picture leads Marcelo and Altair, his new assistant, to Antenor Duarte's land. By suggestion of a procurator, we bring along two journalists Pablo and Marcos. - There are traces here... - This is a child's and here, there's a big one. Look, children's footsteps. There are large ones over here. - It's tied up, over there and here. - Another one, it's probably used for digging holes. - Unearthing potatoes. This, what's this? - It looks like a flute, it's a flute. - It's a flute's mouth. - It's got wax. Look at the way it's creased here. They must be going through this place regularly. - What's this? - It looks like some sort of blocking, - a bit strange... - I don't know, - Some warning for people not to go through. - It's like a blockage. - It was blocking the way... - But now it's open. Let's go back. We already know where the village is, let's go away... Hearing the Indians, Marcelo panicked and wanted to go back. We made a deal: The move would be theirs. If they decided to come near, we would make the contact. - Damn, with these huge guns... - Look, that's them, you see it? - Ok, so keep filming. Easy, friend... angry no... There, far away... She is calling us. - This one here... - He sees that your hand is shaking. - This is the leather they use? - This looks like dear skin. The woman spoke with such vehemence that we began to feel she was narrating a tragedy. I recorded everything. Much later we understood that in fact she was interpreting our own approach, that she had followed since the start. Just as she had observed our steps, they had been following the movement of the farms, snatching plastic bowls, knives, and jute bags, to make their necklaces and their shorts. That night, in the camp, Marcelo had a nightmare: A bulldozer truck was destroying the newfound village. We expected this moment for so many years, believing all would be explained with that encounter. But the impossibility of communication placed us again before a mystery: Who are they? Next on Fantâstico: The dramatic encounter of two Indians with FUNAI's expedition. No one knows where they came from, they speak a mysterious tongue, and bewilder the experts. Two Indians discovered in an isolated area of Rondônia are the latest Amazonian mystery. Reuters headlined the contact internationally, but it was Fantâstico's story that reverberated in the region. Before the images, a proof of the Indians' existence, the federal court decrees that the area be closed. But Mr. Flausino, the landowner's lawyer, is defiant. You saw it on Fantâstico, they showed it in magazines. How are you going to believe in such Indian?! That never had contact with the White Man... An Indian using clothes, an Indian... with plastic, wearing pants... There are the pictures that were included in the dossier... Now they've got more Indians. I can see Indians here... in this magazine now they put up some naked Indians. But when Pablo from the newspaper was there with them, - because I have this tape, I managed to get this tape - there you can see the two Indians that they found. Two Indians with hats on, I don't know if you saw it. Two Indians with denims, with plastic necklaces. Oh, by god, who is going to believe in a story like this?! Not realizing that he is speaking with the author of the images, or, less even, with the person he kicked out ten years earlier, Mr. Flausino proceeds with his ideas. The only place where you don't have large state problems... - I mean, land problems, is Rondônia. Why don't they make indigenous reservations in the savannah, where the Pareci Indians lived? No, they only want to make them where there is mahogany, where there is gold, where there is tin-stone, and where the lands have a pH level above seven. Now, what do they do to not develop a region? What is the way to not see a region develop? What's the way to hold back? Making an indigenous reservation. Because the Unites States, after they killed all their Indians there, in the West, in the Mississippi valley, they became the largest grain producer. And being the largest producer, logically they are the biggest economy in the world. The landowners, with their lawyers, and congressmen, Set up quite the operation, to sell the story that the Indians were planted by Marcelo. One former FUNAI worker and three Cinta Larga Indians go to village, find the Indian woman and her mother. They dress up the women and pose for the picture what would be the evidence of the hoax. The newspaper Estado de São Paulo, that had broke the news on the contact publishes the landowners' version, and never gave us a chance to contest it. When they got there, the women did not speak portuguese. The Cinta-Larga didn't understand, because they have different languages. They saw that they were real I ndians, they saw the crops, they saw everything they had to see, and still maintained the version that all of that had been staged. So, I think there is bad faith in this story. The bad faith is so obvious that they were armed to the teeth. But they were surprised when they passed by our camp without knowing that we were there, and that we had Inês Hargreaves with us, who lived with the Cinta-Larga, who spoke Cinta-Larga. And she called their attention to what they were doing. They were kidnapping Indians, removing them from their land, to give them back to the landowners. I recall that she reminded the Cinta-Larga that they suffered that too, that dynamite was thrown into their village, and that they were doing the same thing, by order of the landowners. The gossip in the region is intense. One month earlier, in the same farm, a group of landless workers has just been slaughtered. It's the Corumbiara Massacre. Sydney Possuelo, then Marcelo's boss in Brasília, comes to visit the contact front, to see the Indians. We've been waiting for days for them to come back. But they haven't returned. I didn't see the Indians. And I stayed there for how many days? Five, four... I wasn't able to see. Ever since that plane flew over them, the Indians went into the jungle and we are still waiting for them to reappear. They only returned once, and we know they came back because some gifts were left and they took them. So they are in the region. After that they didn't show up. They are going to need a space to survive. They must have a space. Where exactly, if it's a bit up or a bit down I don't know, no one can tell now. But there will be a study to assure an area for them, that is beyond dispute. - Nobody knew there were Indians here. - What do you mean? - Nothing, I am just asking, since when are there Indians here? - When was it? The day of the first contact? The third of September. Some 40 days. - No one knew there were these Indians here. - Well, but fact of not knowing doesn't mean they didn't exist. They are there. - There is foul play behind this... - Not from FUNAI. - What would the foul play be? - It's easy for you to have put them in here. - Only someone who doesn't know anything about Indians could say that. - In exchange for what, boss? - Hey boy, stick that camera up your ass! While the Indians don't show up a committee of anthropologists visits our camp. - It was in the same week as the Corumbiara massacre... They hired the gunmen to kill in Corumbiara, and to kill the Indians. As we arrived just before it happened... The anthropologist Virginia Valadão, my wife, prepares the anthropological reports to advise the courts. That day we decided to visit the abandoned village with the hope of finding someone. - She recognized Vincent. - Brought the flute, brought everything... - There's one more now... - I am glad they are more relaxed about us. They feel scared of dogs. Now we know they were at least four: The two from the first day, the mother, photographed by the Cinta Larga and now one more woman showed up. The vocabulary gathered by Inês that day was identified as Canoê in the archives of extinct languages of the Goeldi Museum in Belêm. Workers from the farm watching our camp, airplanes were flying low over the village... and the Indians disappeared. So we got a court order to get the landowners a little bit off our backs. You will have to leave the place. These 1. 15 thousand square miles that go around will be demarcated, a 1.8 mile radius, and FUNAI will take all the appropriate measures to put up these restricting signs. "The shotgun was there by the tree; I was really scared." Marcelo located in Guajara Mirim one of the last speakers of the Canoê language, Mr. Monuzinho. Monuzinho was deperate to see his relatives again, but the Canoê had disappeared. In the 40's, the "Service for the Protection of Indians", gathered all the groups of the region, to have them deported in 1952 to Guagarâ Mirim, in order to free up the rubber exploitations. The Canoê we found were the ones that stayed back in the day. - How is it that the Canoê went on into disappearing? - I don't know, ah yes, it was measles, influenza... Diseases brought by the White man. I am telling you, there was a route passing through the village. Many died. You could see everybody dead along the way, from measles. My brother told me that. These here ran away, to survive. That was many years ago, in 1952. - So you believe these folks here are that same people that ran away back then? - That's right. We looked for them. My dad, my uncle... sent people to look, but they didn't find them. Not even broken weeds, no trace, nothing. - You are lying to me. - Tell these farm folk to go away. - I am scared. - It wasn't us who brought these people from the farm. - But these folks here mean to help us. - They will give you many things. You are sick. - They will give you remedies. - I' II wait and see if it's true. - I had my brother and my mother be brought. - How are we going to give them medicine? My mom has arrived already. This is my mother. It looks like this one is our relative. He speaks our tongue. I looked so much for you. Finally I found you. We came to these bushes here, made our fields and planted our crops. We finished planting and came here. We saw the landowner and ran this way, in fear. We are alone here, it's just my daughter and my son. You showed up and I am glad. I always remember my brothers. They were poisoned to death. I don't know where my folks are. All my brothers are dead. I can't even believe that you really are our relative. For the first time we were able to gather the four Canoê that we had already met. Yamoi, the mother of Pura and Tiramantu, the two we first met, and the nephew Omoró. You look wonderful. - There you go, Vincent! After we insisted a lot, Timamantu agreed to help us find the others - "the Akunsu", as she called them. We constantly suspected that they were hiding the others. Monuzinho's translation was always elliptic, but we realized that there was a tension involved. - What's that over there? - Who made this blockage? - I made this fence because I didn't want the Akunsu to go through here. I am scared of them. They are angry, they fight a lot. Are they really angry? If we go there, do you think they will attack us? They are angry, yes, they even wanted to kill my brother. Take care, you too. They can kill you. When I arrived at the Akunsu, I wanted a wife for my brother, but the old guy didn't allow it. I was mad and wanted to kill them all. But then I took pity on them. Now that you came here, I am not going to kill anyone. Don't film now... Look, there, the old woman is running away. These are the men that were going through your village. We will take you back. And you will plant new crops there. - There are only these two? - Yes, the others are over there. He is also waiting for them. Don't give her the pan. She is going to punch holes in everything. If you give them clothes, they will tear them. Take the pan and hide it from her. It's unbelievable, but amidst that confusion a fight over the new pan began. Omoró took the pan from the old woman twice, and gives an old plate in return. After this first contact, we took the two Akunsu to that old village, close to our camp site. In the afternoon, Omoró brought the rest of the women and the children of the group. We were really attacked. Everyone will die. But we' II stay here because we can't run. Purâ came to see the girl he wants to marry - - the reason of the disagreement between them. Now we' re only missing the Akunsu chief, but we know he's around. When we came back the next day, there he was, running the game. Look at how hairy you are! You have hair on your arms, on your legs. I don't. Tiramantu brought seeds as gifts. On that day we realized the power Tiramantu had over all of them. He is telling the names of the animals that each arrow kills. This is for pig, this is for jacamin... The contact with the Akunsu was with butt-naked Indians, like everybody wanted. But the landowners' campaign worked no newspaper wanted to report it. The media ignores it, FUNAI takes no measures... At least the federal judge from Porto Velho close down the area. Everything I film Marcelo takes to the judge. The vocabulary gathered by Inês this time is identified as belonging to the Tupary group. We brought Mr. Passakâ, a Mequêm indian, to try to talk with the Akunsu. I am all alone now, I don't have any brothers left. The White men killed all of my friends. Bang, bang, they killed everyone with guns, it wasn't arrows. It's only me left. That is why I am afraid of these people from over there. That's why I ran away. But I am not scared of him, or of that one. I am scared of those other White men. - What is it he said? - That he ran in fear of the White men that were killing them in the village. He left everything, the crops, the necklaces, everything... At what time did they attack? The White men attack during daytime. It was noon, the sun was high up above. They came in that noisy machine. That's why only I remained. Do you know these people? After that I only found the dead. The only one I didn't find was my brother's body. I don't know if they took his body to eat it. - I don't think so. - The women's bodies were there, and all the rest. I searched, but I didn't find him. - Where was he when they attacked the village? - Where were you when the White Men attacked? - I was walking around, that's why I survived. The shot only hit me in the arm. My arm was very swollen. I am not scared of him, or of him, neither of you. It's the White Man I fear. When I see a White Man, I feel terrified, it is as if my heart was going to jump out of my chest. - The ones that killed you, how did they come? Through the path in forest? - They came in a machine that made a lot of noise. They came down close to us. We were very scared. Passakâ's translation is vague, but the confirmation of the massacre is unmistakable. We now know that his name is Konibu. The Canoê moved their village to the other side of the pasture to be farther away from the Akunsu. Around this time we got the news that a lumberjack employee had found an Indian hut, but 25 miles from our camp site. We asked the Canoê once again to go with us to come investigate with us. In the Bagatoli there are many signs of indigenous presence. And the logging activity is intense. In the lack of a better name, we called them "Hole Indians" which was the most striking thing. There is no mention to a people like this in the literature. The "Hole Indians" are another mystery. The information I can give you is that I never saw anything. I've been here five years. I was told by a worker. Some days ago, I was here, and he told me. "Look, we saw a hut in there, but didn't see anyone." "We only saw the little hut, with a hole inside." I didn't even go there. - There are these rumors we've been hearing about Indians being shot. Have you heard these rumors? - Not here, only in the Modelo farm, not here in Erasa. - This is another farm. But here in the region? - In the Modelo farm I've hear the gossip. - And what is this gossip? - They say there was an Indian and they opened fire on a hut. Scaring the Indian away... But I don't know if he's dead or not. They threw out the Indian. We can't do our job? How am I going in there if you lock the gate? Then I can't go in and check. - The gate was opened? - It was. - How? - By us, we opened it. - You broke it? - No we didn't, we took the clamps off. It's there in the same way. - Show me where it says... - Look, if you have any concerns, sue me. - They came here to warn you and you were out. - If you are not happy then file a lawsuit against us et c'est fini, all right?! - Are you the person coming along? - Do you want a copy of this? - We can't waste any time, this has to be quick, don't get into many details. - All right? - If you are not happy with it file a lawsuit against me. Marcelo and Altair spot something strange in the satellite picture: An irregular clearing in the middle of the natural reserve, that was not there last summer. Therefore, the deforestation was done in the rainy season. And normaly nobody does this because the forest doesn't burn and the work is lost. Why then? - It wasn't just one house, it was a whole village. Look at the pieces of wood there. There was more than one house! Look, another one here! - This was really a house. - Man, look at the size this was! The traces that the landowners where trying to hide revealed an old occupation of the place by Indians. I didn't see it. But according to the guys that cleared the forest, they say there was a hut in there. Milton worker at Modelo farm The guys that cleared the field. - What was left of the hut we already found. - You found it! - Of course. - Then it's that. - Mr. Hercules made us the favor of opening a road... and bulldozing right over. - He thinks that we were born yesterday. He cleared exactly the spot where the huts were. The clearing of the Indian field is that. It's that but I didn't see it. I knew it because they mentioned it. And I went there when they were preparing the field. When I went there the little hut was still standing. But since then I never went back. I went now... - Was it only one hut? - That I saw, it was. - And what about those holes? - Yes, but I didn't come close. Go figure what was in there! - It was clean there, right? - I don't know, I went up to the hut and started back. - We have to find the Indian but with that bulldozer it's impossible. - I have this headache... With the support of the Federal Police the officer informs the landowner that we can enter the farm. - Can I ask you a question? - Yes, you can ask. Are you are aware that there were found traces of isolated Indians here in the Modelo farm? I have no knowledge of it. But you do know that the manager of the shop knows about it? If he knows something about it I don't. - And you are? - Vicente Carelli. - Tell me how things are going, Alemão. - It's all the same here, and about the traces, it's the same from when you left. We found more old traces, two, three months old, here, close to the field, ok? 20 years in the field and I had never heard the legendary Uirapuru singing. Here amidst the destruction he came everyday at night fall to say goodbye. - Good afternoon. - Are you the filmmaker at my house the other day? - Yes. - What was you name again? - Vicente Carelli. That day, the owner of the farm, followed by two henchmen and two policemen, arrested me. They said that the court order did not allow the presence of a filmmaker. When they were about to take me away I asked to show them the evidences we had found. The policement accepted but Hercules didn't want to see. And what would be purpose of these holes? - It's a mystery. And they made them in their houses too as you would see if you went there. - Inside the hut? - Inside. Two little huts we found had these holes. - Well, for me it's enough, let's go. On the way to the police station, I said I was the author of the images on Fantâstico. And I added: "If you go on like this, You' II be the star of the next story." Hercules thought it through and ordered the policemen to take me back to the camp. The evidences were clear, but the law of silence ruled. I decided to stay away from the FUNAI team and stay for some days in Xupinguaia, to hear the city's gossip. I find out that Helenice, the cook of the inn where I was staying, had just ran away from the Modelo farm. Helenice and her husband were hired to burn over the deforestation and knew about everything. Mariquinha knows about the time we went there. We got there in April. My husband is a contractor and they think he cleared the field, but it was not him. That was done after October, actually, it was January of last year. I mean, in beginning of this year. - During the rainy season. - Yes, to burn it during the drought... The microphone failed in the beginning of the interview. I only realized the disaster when I arrived at the inn. Desperate, I came back at night, to record an interview without images. I am nervous, my head hurt all day. A silly concern... This is serious, I am considering going away tomorrow. I'll start from the beginning, as I am already in this mess. Whe were hired to clear for pastures, as I told you, but then, the man called us after days of us being there, saying that they had cleared that area. My husband was called to burn for him. We went without knowing anything and I was scared of being there, so I came back, and the man who cleared the land was the one that shot over the Indians, so they'd run away. That's what happened. - How many did they see? - I heard them talk of 3. - And how were they dressed? - No, they say they were naked. Hairy Indians, they say. Savage, naked Indians. When they started to clear they threw the huts down. And the wife of the man that made the clearing, her and her husband burned the hut. It was on a Sunday. The wife of the man that cleared the field, her and him, together. She only set fire because the husband was there. - They cleared alone? - No, but we don't know who these workers are. - The landowner gave them guns so they'd scare the Indians. - It sounds correct, because he has two guns. But the rancher must have given more for himself. He gave support, provided a tractor, so he'd go in there. Told them to cut trails in the forest, were the Indians had made those little trails of cut trees. He ordered them to use scythes so no one would find the indians' trace. He had a machine to fill in some holes, that's what the people say. - And what else did you hear? - That's what I heard. - Do you think that they killed the Indians? - I think they must be alive, if they killed them, they would have mentioned, we would know. They would talk about it. You know how farm workers are... - So they shot over them to scare them away. - Yes, to scare them off. - The Indians didn't come back? - Not that I know of. Then they say that some guys working there saw one, but just one. - He showed up, just like that? - No, if he sees someone he runs away. He runs, that's what the man who cleared the field said. I feel terrible about filming Helenice secretly, but I am obsessed with finding the truth. Now everything fits: The landowners reacted to the TV's news, and kicked the "Hole Indians" out. 10 years later history repeats itself: Just as the Akunsu were murdered in 84 in the Yvypitã farm, the "Hole Indians" are now attacked in the Modelo farm. I've long lost the track of the documentary. What interests me is gathering the necessary evidence and putting the culprits in jail. To the prosecutor, the felony is only that of "violent expulsion". A "first time defendant" wouldn't even go to jail, and our witness would be risking her life. Helenice became a weight in my consciousness. While I thought about what to do, to my relief, she moved away without leaving an address. And that, for me, I think was the final disappointment. No matter how close, how many elements we gather... - We are never winning this story... No matter how many evidences. - It's never enough. - We are never catching these people. - Even if Konibu says now that he was shot, that they hurt him, in order to prove who did what, and by whose order... This is an endless story. - I think that now it's not about proving anymore what matters is that we tell this story. Two years later, the Hole Indian's impasse persists. The restrictions on the area that we managed to get in court are temporary. If we don't find the one who seems to be the last survivor, the farm will be opened. The Indian will only legally exist if we manage to film him. An Indian that no one saw is hearsay. Many approaches have been attempted, but he still refuses our gifts. - Is there a hole? - It's shallow. Friend! - Did he run there? - He is inside the house. - Really? - Yes. - Look at his arrow. - Be careful, Vincent. - Arrow no. - Easy. - Come, come here. - He's got the bow armed. - There's the tip, Vincent. - Watch out, Vincent! - Now he came this way. - Here, look! - Come here, come out. He's not even going to throw the last arrow... For six hours we surrounded this Indian without him uttering one word, one shout, nothing... He only tried to spear me because of the camera. Altair came much closer but he didn't do anything. Ironically, it is the camera that made him exist for the courts. - The moment I was able to film him, when I was able to go around the house, stand behind that tree that was connected to the house and it would be easy to remove the cover of the house, and leave him there, naked in front of us, when I felt this possibility, and he had been resisting for hours, I felt a deep disturbance. I began to feel ill: What sons of bitches we are... - The violence for us to get that image... - I had a nightmare during that chase. I remember those old TV series on African safari tours where the people who took care of the reserves would shoot those darts. Then they would take the lion, treat his teeth... I had a nightmare where I did this to him, where the only way was to surround and dart him. Then when he woke up, there, the contact was made. - He took 4 years to clear his first field. He actually planted nice crops, and we found out that even if we walked over the stumps of the field, to leave no traces... Alemão was there, took pictures of his house, and of the plantation. He found out we were there and left his fields again. He moved closed by and abandoned his field. So, we figured we were the cause of his moving around. We were disturbing, and upsetting him Virgínia died from a heart attack. But I am still with the Indians from Corumbiara. Two more years went by, and the Hole Indian still hides. In this trip we met the owner of the farm where the Indian is. Celso Desorde, a doctor from São Paulo, is in a curious situation. The restriction on the area prescribed, a group of landless workers is camping in front of his farm. If the government says his land is not productive, the landless occupy it. I had never seen a landowner asking FUNAI to close an area. After the area was restricted, when we changed, we started to leave gifts that he now accepts. He took corn and manioc seeds. They are planted in his field, So, he is planting there, it's a sign that he'll settle down. FUNAI also has the power to close the area so, we filed a request to close it for a year. Either he stays there for good, if we find there's really no way to make contact. Or we make contact. If we can't make it, then we' II think of something like that, and this Indian will coexist with you. He in the forest and you out here. - Well, that's it, there's no problem. Let's do it, after all he is a human being just like us, isn't he? So we' II have some patience with him. I am glad you feel this way, because your neighbors don't. The relationship between the Canoê and the Akusu worsened. Alemão found Umoró quartered in the Akunsu field. She was probably stealing corn. Umoró was a servant. But the feeling of supremacy of the Canoê drove Umoró to treat the Akunsu with brutality. Every time she broke in their homes to take the presents I brought, I would turn off the camera. The Akunsu also had many difficulties. A giant tree fell over the village. Killing the youngest girl and breaking Konibu's hip, leaving him crippled. At last! - Ask him: It went through here but didn't come out anywhere? - Where did it come out? - Is it still inside? We called Pedro Mequêm, Passakâ's brother, to talk to Konibu. - Only one shot? - And Babâ also took one? - On him it was just a scratch. In this second chat with Konibu we realize that the boy, Popak, had also been shot. And we keep asking Konibu to take us where everything happened, but he refuses. - Blow on my hand. Dispite the conflicts between the Canoê and the Akunsu, the romance between Purâ and the girl continues, but without Konibu's support. In Porto Velho I find out that the company that demarcated Corumbiara had already come accross these Indians in the 70's. Therefore it was naive of me to think of only one culprit. In fact, during all those years there had been a chain of omission and negligence and acts of brutality. Unable to develop the lawsuits against the culprits I abandon the investigation and give up on the documentary. Six years have passed and a Dutch journalist contacts me to talk about Corumbiara. Old emotions return and make me think about the film I had abandoned. And I decide to re-embark on this endless story. The deforestation in the area continued. And now, besides cattle, the soy plantations are everywhere. It's election year and the government of Rondônia invests heavily in the new "cattle road." The affairs of Mr. Flausino, the landowners' lawyer, go very well. He took a degree in environment law precisely to be able to dispute government fines. The Hole Indian still refuses contact in Celso Desorde's farm. Marcelo becomes head of Isolated Indians bureau in Brasília. They came to Brasilia, Celso Desorde and another guy, his lawyer, partner, I don't know, to ask if they could clear. They had authorization to clear a thousand hectares. But they can't deforest due to FUNAI's restrictions. They wanted our approval. "He's further south, we' II only clear another thousand, otherwise the farm is economically unsustainable..." I said: " Mr. Celso, you've known us for ten years. You bring us this story, but it's no use. I am not authorizing you to fill that place with people, to deforestate the area even more. It's not possible, this situation won't change, Mr. Celso. Make proper use of what you have, use as best as you can what you have cleared. We will not allow it. And if you do, you' II get in trouble. And if this Indian disappears, you will be the first one to be held responsible. It's best for you to take good care of this Indian, and leave him alone in his spot. But it's over, that's it. - My name is Vicência. My name. That other name is not mine. "Conceição!" Switching my name... - So, it's not Conceição? - No! Once more we go after the Mequên Indians to help talk to the Akuntsu. Manoel and his mother Vicência are in mourning. Her son, chief Damião, who was illegaly selling timber from the reservation, had been murdered a month before. In a deal gone wrong with the loggers. - He is saying he wished he was an arrow, flying around, so he could go to Passakâ's house. He compares it to an arrow. He wished to be one so he'd go there fast, flying. Always happy to find people who speak their language, the Akunsu confirm to Manoel and Vicência what we already know. - Purâ! - Alemão is going away. - I am leaving. Ten years have passed, many of them have died, and they still weren't able to settle Purâ's marriage with the girl. Some cultural barriers seem unbreakable. But this time Konibu seems to support the idea. Hearing Konibu's flute, I imagine how it must have been a whole Akunsu village with some 20, 30 flute players. I miss that which will be no more. The Canoê lost their mother to a mysterious death, and lived a deep grief. Tiramantu had a child from a relationship with Konibu, and devotes herself entirely to this boy, withdrawn in her village, far from the Akunsu and the FUNAI post.
