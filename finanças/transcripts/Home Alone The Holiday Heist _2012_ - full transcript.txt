Guys, come on. Honey, you've done good. And it's gonna be homely... once we get all our stuff moved in. Look at all the space. How can we even afford it? Did somebody die in here or something? Alexis. I'm serious. People get really good deals if they find like a dead body in the basement. No body died. We got a good deal. People moved out and we're moving in. Maybe it's haunted. Probably built on an Indian burial ground or something. If we dig into the backyard, I bet we find bones. Ooo fess!!! She's just pulling your chain, buddy. Mom mom, what was that? Did you hear that? Was that a ghost - No, it's a Realtor. Hello, Baxter. I was just putting the finishing touches on this little house warming gift. - Wow thank you. - And you must be the wee ones? - Thatâ€™s the wee ones. - Welcome to Maine. They're not real good with real people. They better with space robots and cell phones and things. You're gonna love it here, I guarantee it. Does that mean you'll take this house back if we hate it? Ho Ho Ho Ho they just so precious aren't they? Catherine, here are the keys. And if you have any other questions... - I have a question. - What is it, honey? In this house haunted? Haunted? Do not be silly. It just has personality. What's that supposed to mean? Welcome Mr. Hughes. Nice ride. If we're like going to the prom or something. Is this the best we can do. Hughes this is Jessica. She's handling the security and surveillance. Nice to meet you. Let's get right down to it shall we... - This here is our next target. - A creepy old house? A not just any creepy old house, my dear girl. That creepy old house once belonged to Jimmy Crovano, a notorious bootlegger. We're stealing boots? Boot legging. He's smuggling alcohol. When it was against the law in the 1920s. Boots, Booze, I do not care . Just as long as I get paid. A well Jimmy, Dead Leg, Crovano, was known for two things. One, his boot leg Moonshine. And two... He was the previous owner of a priceless work of art. Edvard Munch's, "The Widow". Oh, God, Sinclair not again. I have finally found her... You say that every time. When we broke into the Boston museum, When we broke into the Bank of London... When we broke into that Lama farm in Peru. Sounds like a wild goose chase to me. I'm out. - It's worth $85 million Dollars. - I'm in is what I meant to say, I'm in. Good. Well, I think we've found our self A safe cracker. Goodness sake. Am I missing something? Against my advice she got romantically entangled with our last safe cracker. Of course it ended predictably. Now, look, this house just came on the market. If we hurry, we can get inside before any one even moves in. Mrs. Catherine Baxter. Look what the mailman hath brought. Hu! Did you get into Hogwarts or something?

Yes, on line we play together all the time. It's cool, he's my friend. Well have you ever met this friend like in real life? No. But he's your friend. What do you know about him? He prefers pulse grenades. Yeah, who doesn't. Have you ever considered making some real friends? Why? Well you gotta get out the house once in a while. You know what I'm saying? Try something new.

Lets go. Coming. - Done, want me to do the glasses? - I'm gonna say no. - Smell that? - Yes. You don't smell that in California my friend. That's called air. It's all around this place. Hum smells good. That's a tent. How about after we get settled in, you and I go camping. Two men the great outdoors, what do you think? Well you hate camping. Ye well, maybe both off us need to try things out of our comfort zone here. You wanna take that one down to the basement? And, basement, I'm coming with you lets go. People get really good deals if they find a dead body in the basement. The basement level on "Dragons and Warriors" is a prison. Filled with ghosts. Ye well the basement in real life, is just a basement. You can do this. Dad like he's watching you. Down the stairs!!! Mom, I know but... Go outside and go play it will be good for you There's a boy next door you can play with. I do not want to meet anyone new. Can I just go upstairs and play my game? Finn, are you trying to tell me you're afraid to cross the yard... - and meet a friend? - What would we even talk about? Ask him what he likes to do for fun. Oh guys, I am so sorry. So, what do you like to do for fun around here? Lots off stuff. Like what? You know build snowmen make snowballs... Go snow sledding, design snow forts go snow skiing... make snow angels, start a snow avalanche, wear snow shoes... play hide and go snow, did I already say make snowballs? I get it, am but isn't there anything that doesn't involve snow? We can make Snow Cones? Oh Wait... Maybe you could come over to my place for video games. I have Robo Inventory 3. It has multi-player. You can be a strike robot. Na aa now way. Why not? Your house is haunted that's why the last people moved out. Haunted? Doors creak open. Lights flash on and off for no reason. It's the ghost of a gangster who was murdered there. He was smothered to death in his sleep. No way that's real. That's imaginary. Oh It really. My mom said it was a long time ago... but at night they say you can still hear him. Walking around, dragging his deformed across the floor. Looking for revenge against anyone who tries to sleep. I'd like to hang out with you but I'm too young to die. Dead Leg is watching. All right, big guy turn off the Video game it's lights out. Can I do, can I do one more level? Hi Hun, your liking your new room? Hello? - Take your headphones. - They're ear buds. Look, I know this move has been hard on you. So why are we here, mom? It's my new job. Its a big step for me. It's something I've been working towards a long time. But more importantly... The reason we decided to move was because your father and I decided that we wanted the best for you and your brother. The best like a 32 gig tablet computer with a pink sequin case? There's more to the holiday's than just gifts. Great, lame Christmas. That went well. Come on, we did it. The Baxters have moved to Maine. Maniens, Mania .. acs or Manomiums. This is a mistake? Did I up root our family for a stupid Job where nobody will appreciate me? Sweet hart, we appreciate you. You know that. And you know your going to be the best VP... these maniacs have ever had. I dragged us all the way across the country. Our children hate me... - That's not true, and you know it. - Alexis hates me. Ye okay, ye she hates you. But shes gonna out grow it. And our son spends every waking minute plugged into video games. Just needs a little push out of the nest hes a little shy that's all. He has no real friends, friends his age friends who aren't space marines. He's scared of his own shadow. He's got an over active imagination, what's wrong with that? Walking around, dragging his deformed leg across the floor. Looking for revenge against anyone... but my room is totally haunted by a ghost murderer aarrr. What? Oh buddy. Okay, look I understand. Change can be scary. Moving, is never, never easy. This isn't about change, Dad? This is about survival I want to sleep in here. - There's safety in numbers. - Okay, honey bunch. You are too old to be afraid of ghosts. Real life is hard enough without making up stuff to be afraid of. You heard the boss right I mean back to bed You'll be fine. You'll both be singing a different tune tomorrow... as an evil ghost smothers me in my sleep. Back to bed. Fine but if I have to sleep in there all by myself I'm taking precautions. Robosquad 256. Police shields up and scanners online. Weapons are charged permission to fire on all ghosts. This is not a drill. Got you. What in the world is going on. I was trying to catch the ghost!! Oh for gods sake. With a stun gun in a tent? I couldn't rule out vampire or zombie. You are not to touch this ever. But if I prove this house is haunted, We can move back to California. - You're an idiot. - Alexis, don't call your brother an idiot. Finn, listen You know you know what Hun it's OK I got this I got this its OK. OK Sorry, Dad. Hey, buddy. Finny Finny Finn, that's ah impressive. What's going on? I heard it Dad. It was... It was real. OK well ah, where... where did you hear it Where is it? Shuffling. Like someone was dragging there dead leg. Oh, buddy look just a tree branch you can hear it that's all. Dude, I know this is different than our old house. But I promise you you have absolutely nothing to be afraid off OK, okay? - We're too late. - Somebody's already moved in. Well that never stopped me before. We'll just wait until no one is home and then... We'll strike. Now eat up everybody we have a big day today. We are picking out our Christmas tree, and we're getting new decorations, and... Deck our new halls together. How does that sound? We should prepare. The ghosts could come back while we're out. Oh look kido, I don't care what you've learnt from your video game, there's no such thing as ghosts especially at Christmas time... Ghost of Christmas Past, Ghost of Christmas present... Ghost of Christmas future, Marley's ghost... Well that's why we're getting a tree. Because a little known fact, Christmas spirit repels all ghosts. Now, hurry up. We're gonna leave as soon as your father is done clearing the driveway. That could be a while. Come on, I can do this. - We can't live like this. - Amateur. What are you doing weirdo? Making more ghosts traps. I'm going to prove this place is haunted. You'll see. Then we can all move back home. There is no ghost, I was just messing with you. No there is. So whats your big plan? Rap the ghost up and tuck it under the Christmas tree? Look, if the ghost tries to get out of the basement while we're gone... This wrapping paper will rip proof, the ghost is real. Humm wouldn't real ghost just float through the door? You're not helping. The driveways clear. Are you guys ready, its gonna be fun. With a crew back home we rolled in with shot guns and masks off Presidents and everything. I'm usually Ronald Reagan. Do you want me to kick the down like yo... Get down on the floor, nobody move, put the money in the bag or I'll blow your head off... How fascinating. Why don't you just shut up? We're in. Great. Oh ginger bread cookies. I like to eat the head first. Then the arm, then the leg. Understand this. My crew is expected... To slip in and out of our targets, undetected like ghosts. Got you chief. Oh you got me Hughes did you? You really got me? And that doesn't mean dragging in dirt and snow like that Or eating their freshly baked cookies. And I don't care whether there ginger bread men or Chocolate coated macaroons... Chocolate covered coconut macaroons were Steve's favorite. Oh shut up, both of you. Just look, this is important. There can be no mistakes. Right, all right now look pull yourself together, Come on. Deep breath. Come on now go. Find yourself a nice window and keep look out. You, come with me. Is that a no go on a glass of milk? Now. There's nothing here. Ah that's just what the old bootlegger wants us to think. You know, sometimes I even amaze myself. Come on, Ronald Reagan. You're up. Get ready to have your mind blown. Not use to doing this without the mask. Oh would you look at that. It reminds me of Steve. That's what I'm talking about. Ye move. I, I don't understand. Maybe somebody beat us to it? No. Its impossible, all my research, all my planing. All the historical cross checking, I... My beloved Gigi should be here. Your beloved what? We were supposed to have a house together like this. To grow old together. Baby I miss you. Can you please just return my calls? Oh crap, I gotta go. Please just call me. Code red! Code red! Code red quick, we've been compromised go go go. Okay gang, So your mam and I will get the straps Vin you and Alexis get the back. Make sure the weight is balanced evenly. OK Alexis Fin I'm gonna come to you guys. A ghost. Are you sure you saw something? Yes, it was right here by the window. Buddy, have you ever heard of the fable the boy who cried ghost? If my sweater is ruined you are so... We should check to see if anything is out of place. Finn come here, lets calm down and talk about this. Cookies are missing look look look look. There were six ginger bread men here at breakfast. Now there are only four. All this proves is that someone disobeyed me... when I said no ginger bread men for breakfast. And look, a ghost trap. The ghost is out. It came from the basement. OK that is actually creepy. Don't encourage him. Honey, tell your son there's nothing to be afraid off. I think I just got the chills Nothing came out of the basement!!! All of you are acting ridiculous. She's right!!! OK there's nothing there and I'm just gonna check it out... Dad wait... Light on.

What's going on? Somebody took my headphones. What? That's it. Family announcement. We are not moving back to California. Not because of ghosts. Not because of poorly conceived acts of teenage rebellion, not ever. We' are all going to learn to love this quaint little town and this big creepy house because we have to Humm. It's bad enough you dragged us all the way across the country. Now we've got to parade around with smiles on our faces just so that you don't feel guilty? So what you'd rather not go? Stay at home is that what you want? Totally, maybe I might actually like this place If I wasn't around you guys all the time. OK great, you two can stay hear while your dad and I have all the Christmas fun we can handle. Seriously? Ye you wanna stay home, stay home!!! But there are some terms and conditions. First of all Alexis, you are babysitting Finn. Wait hold on. Works for me. And no video games. No games no TV no music no phone. They probably want you to leave her a phone?

Merry Christmas. OK guys, we'll call you from the party. Behave. I don't think we've ever made mam this mad before. Whatever. So I guess its just you and me? You're on your own weirdo. You leave me alone, I leave you alone. That's the deal. But she took my game controller, what am I suppose to do? I don't care. Whatever you want, we're home alone. Mmm, I wonder if they sell them individually? Huu alright I just have to stabilize the ankles. Who's Gigi? None of your business. What! Who's Gigi? By the safe you said my beloved Gigi should be here so... I wanna know who are we really looking for. Are we looking for a body? Come here. Gigi was my great grandmother... and if you must know she is the widow. Edvard Munch was so enraptured by her doleful beauty... That he painted her into a masterpiece. In the painting she's seen sitting with her children. Her family. My family. Oh the canvas was stolen decades ago. But I'm going to find her. She belongs to me. You okay sweaty? Sure, why? Because your still holding Finns controller. Thanks! If I just... I do not know I. I'm all for pushing Finn out off the nest a bit. But should we really leave them home alone? In a new place? You know what a few hours away, will be nice. Hey maybe they'll learn a thing or two about responsibility. I'm jumping on the sofa. I do not care. I'm eating junk food. I don't care. I broke a lamp.

But you can't tell Mom I went out, deal Deal. What was that? Don't be such a chicken. I got it lets go. Why do you think a ghost lives down here anyway? Cos I found the ghosts room. Look. But this was locked. I tried it. A ghost must have opened it. If you're trying to scare me Its not going to work. It probably only looks empty. In Robo Infantry 2, you could find amo rooms that looked empty... but they would have a secret door. This isn't some stupid video game looser. There's no secret door. See. Holly cow Did I mention that the secret rooms were often booby-trapped? Come on. This is totally cool. Oh OK Oh well you've seen it. Let's go. Talk about a creepy family. Ye wait wait come here.

What do you say we ditch this shindig? Err its gonna take us a while to get back down the mountain in this weather. Sounds good. I want to get home before bedtime, in case Finn is scared. I love you. To you my dear say your goodbyes. Excuse me, everyone, out off my way Ah theirs good news and bad news. The bad news is that this little winter storm. Has picked up you know. And all the roads leading down the mountain will be temporarily closed. Arr excuse me sir, for how long? Good question, Carla. Oh Its Catherine actually. For those in the back, Carla Baxter. Our new VP. And asks how long we expect the roads to be shut down? I have no idea. But the good news is. There plenty more adult eggnog right. Go get them, Santas. I'm here. Hello Finn, I'm down stairs. Who builds a house like this is, this is so lame. Now I'm talking to myself. Di Did you leave yet? Gonna be stuck here for A while. Frozen Pizza in freezer.

Ooow you were out of pulse grenades. You've beaten me like a million times. How do you always do it? - Is this Andy? - Who's Andy? - Wow how old are you dude? - Ten. Man I thought you were this other guy I played with. If I'd known you were just a kid... I wouldn't of over killed you so many times. So what if I'm ten? No, you rock dude you're good. You just need to learn to preserve your ammo. - Do you know what the word conserve means? - I'm ten, not an idiot. Right right sorry So how did you get so good? Practice. You just got to devote 10 to 14 hours a day to the game you know. Priorities. My parents will only let me play for an hour A day. That's your problem right there. I live alone so... You can play video games all day and night and no one ever tells you to clean up your room? Ye it's pretty much thee best thing about going to College. Sounds amazing. So I asked for the new Robo expansion pack for Christmas. What did you ask for? I don,t really do the hole Christmas thing since I don't live with my folks anymore. So your not going to visit them? Naa I don't really have, you know the cash... To blow on plane tickets right now anyways. - So you don't get Christmas? - Oh they'll send me something. - Well if you're alone, it is not really Christmas. - I never thought about it like that before. I.. I'll keep you company. Wanna play again? Sure. I'll even give you some pointers. - O'Oh, Oh what you got to go? - Do you believe in ghosts? Finn, I believe this plain of existence has many mysteries. Right it's just a branch, just a branch. Dead Leg. - Perimeters clear. - No movement all good. I don't want to alarm you, but I think I just saw someone in that window upstairs. A flickering or a I don't know a shadow, or something. This guy in town was telling me this place is haunted. The gangster who stole your great grannies picture... He got murdered in this house. You left that part out didn't you. Maybe he doesn't want anyone to touch his painting. You know if we had some sage we could cleanse the house out. Don't be absurd. - I don't want to upset some ghost gangster. - Look we're going in. Ghost or no ghosts. Now come on lets go get your tools. You too come on. - Dude can you still hear me? - Its the ghost hes back. Did you watch a scary movie on cable or something? What no!! Whatever you do, do not stay up late and watch R rated movies. It sounds like a good idea, but you can't un-see that stuff man. I have to do something. Hiding under the blankets sometimes works. You're not helping. Be right back. I thought you said they were at a Christmas party. It's the ghost, It's the ghost. Oh I know what it is. It's just a security device that's all. Or maybe they didn't all go to the the party. Look don't be silly. You know Santa Claus, elves, eggnog... I mean people in small towns, they love that kind off crap. I don't know. I'm getting a ghostly feeling. I think I'm feeling it too. Look there are no ghosts, you fools. I mean God Listen to yourselves. Come on. Err I'm not walking into a haunted house in the middle off the night. I'm not crazy. I'm getting chills on the back off my neck. - Code red, Code red!!! - Come back here, come back. It worked. The ghost is gone. What's that? Finn! Finn! Finn! Finn! Alexis, are you home? Finn! Why! Dad. - Finn, it's me. - Alexis? Get me out of here. I'm stuck in the basement. - In the secret room? - Yes, moron. I've been yelling for you. I'm in the upstairs bathroom. I thought you were at the mall? I wish I was at the mall. Where are Mom and Dad? They sent a text, they're gonna be late. Great it's so creepy down here. You gotta get me out now. Walk up too the safe, Walk up too the safe Aww she can't hear me. I'll get you out somehow I promise. She still can't hear me. - More snow. - I see that. Wanna make snowballs with me? I have a system to make the perfect snowball. I can't right now. My sister is trapped in the basement. Gonna have to buy supplies to her out. Oh cool. See you later. That,s 2152 dollars and 71 cents. And whom should I make this out to? We only take personal checks with a valid driver's license. I must of left that in my other pants. What can I get for a dollar 68 cents? Happy holidays. Merry Christmas. - I.m sorry. - Be careful, young man. What's the rush? Is there a fire somewhere? An Americano, on pumpkin Mocha Latte, with extra whipped cream. Thanks. - I'm still not going in the haunted house. - What it gonna take for you... Two bozos to complete the job you were explicitly hired to do. That is break into an empty house and steal a simple painting. Please do tell. More money. Aa ye more money. More money oh you got to be kidding? And you, you drag in filth and crumbs into the scene? And you, you botch the look out an amateur. And now you want a bigger split of the spoils oh come on? I believe you want your Gigi back? Look we had a deal. 25% for you... 25 for ding bat here and 50 for me. Ye well the deals changed now since the ghosts. 50 Percent for me, 50 percent for Jessica, 25 percent for you. What Look we're gonna split it three ways. Otherwise we walk a Gigi goes bye bye. You are a hard hearted woman. Want to help me finish my snow fort? I can't right now, a team off art thieves are planning an assault on my new house. - I'm the only one who can defend it. - Oh cool see you later. Billy Alexis The house isn't haunted we're under siege, Its being robbed! This isn't one of your games Finn. I know I was wrong about the ghosts before, but there are art thieves. Just stop screwing around, and get me out off here. Or find someone who can. Whats up little man need some more players? Thieves are attacking my house. I'm under siege. What game are you talking about? They're almost here. How do I stop them from getting in? Um, sounds like a tower defense game! Like level 17 on Robo Infantry 3. Exactly. Now what are your characters skills and abilities? Umm I'm good at traps. Excellent, now don't just set one or two, the key to these type of games you need to stagger your defense OK. I have to identify the weakness in my perimeter. And set the turrets. Right but to really win, you need traps that deploy on there own. Like your pulse grenades. AAA you figured out my my secret now how much ammo do you have? Well none, all I could afford was this spool of string. I gotta get this game it sounds awesome. - AAA so that's not allot to work with. - I can use my environment. Great ye um that's how these games usually work. You need to think out side the box and find other resources. Ye I can do that. Ye I know you can dude your like the smartest kid I know. You can figure out the specifics. And hey if you need any more pointers I'll be online... For the next eight to ten years probably. - You know what my dad always says? - What? You got to get outside the house buddy. Enjoy the real world. It's the best game there is. The only thing to be afraid of in this house is me. Look at this. See the house is haunted, the ghost knows were coming... Oh really! Ah did the ghost use that bucket to? - He's got a point. - Come on you two focus here... All right. We're not a bunch of two bit bandits. We're not going to be stymied by a slippery walkway.
