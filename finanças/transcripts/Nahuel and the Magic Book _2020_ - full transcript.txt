That's my bag! Wait, no! No! No! My notebook! Hey Calfunao, if we take him with us to the boat? - What? A boat? - I don't know, Roro. This crybaby? Thanks guys. But I can't, I've got to... - I've got to... - Running away from the sea Nahuelcito? I told you Roro, a crybaby. What's up Nahuel! Are you scared of mermaids? Or the sorcerers? Or the ghost ships, like Roro? Hey! You shouldn't play with that! My uncle was taken by a ghost ship! Your uncle left because he owed everyone in this town. Is that so? At least my dad doesn't spend the whole day at the bar. Hey! He got issues. By the way your mom is always there too. - Idiot! - Dumb face! - Where are you going Nahuel? - No, no. Wait guys, no! Don't think you're going to get away from the boat ride. No guys, please! No! Not the sea! No, let me go! - I don't want to go! - Come back here coward! He's scared of the sea. He's a little chicken. What's up Nahuelcito? You are that afraid of the sea? - He's scared of the sea! - Please guys, stop it! No, no! Let me go! Please stop it! I said don't want to! Wait until I get my hands on you! You are dead Nahuel! Dead! Dead! Dad! I came as fast as I could. You are late. I don't even ask you to get on the boat to help me offload. Just to be here on time. Is that too much to ask? - Dad is just-- - Is it? No dad. You're going to buy some eggs before school. Hello Mr. Simón. Can I have a dozen of eggs, please? Of course kid. Nahuel! Nahuelcito! I've got mint and chamomile for the stomach! And also snail unguent. Good for the skin! I've tried it myself! Can you tell? - Yes Ms. Hilda. - I've got incense. And Saint Expedito too! This one here is miraculous! Miraculous? And a dozen of eggs for the boy. Thanks, here you have. Ms. Hilda... Do you have something for fears? Fears? That's for witches! Miss! I've got some chamomile and mint. Good for digestion! What... You? Comeback here dumb! Nahuel! Come on Rorro! But! My fries! Excuse me! Don't run away coward! - Sorry! - Comeback here! Excuse me! Nahuel! Excuse me! Hello, hi... excuse me! Watch out, coming through! Come back. Here brat! Look where you're going kid! Nahuel! No! The eggs. You like my fishy smell, right kitty? Hey! My keys! Hey! Wait! Thief cat! Come kitty cat! Kitty-kitty, come! Great! Just what I needed. Wait! "Past century Wizards". "Potions and incantations". "Mermaids". "Black magic". What is this place? Annoying cat! Of all witchcraft and wizardry books, this is the most powerful ever written. His origins are unknown, but we know his name The Levisterio. Able to grant unparalleled power to whomever posees it superior to any brother of the darkness. However, The Levisterio has awaken the worst in us, an endless ambition that has carried us to self-destruction. Is because of this, that we have chosen a guardian. A sorcerer who will dedicate his life to take care of this book at his home, which will be properly protected though magic. The sorcerers council, August, 1948. "Bravery incantation". Who is in there? I said, who's in there! I heard a noise. I'm not deaf! I won't say it again! Who dared to get in the guardian's house?! Don't think because I am old and blind, I won't find you? Wizard, I'm warning you, my magic will find you, and it will be the end of you. Many have tried. But they have miserably failed! Nothing? Fish! Ceviche? My precious, is that you? So you were the meanie who has been messing around? Tell me, let's see where did you got fish? You stole it, didn't you?! Bad kitty! Bad, bad! Master Kalku... Raiquen, you've got something for me, don't you? What do you have for me? It's about the book. The Levisterio? What about it? It's not under protection anymore. It has been taken from the guardian's house. How did it happen? A kid took the Levisterio. A kid? Of course! I can see him sneaking out right under the old guardian's nose, and his stupid anti-wizards magic. I suppose you have sent some birds following the trace of that brat. Yes, Master Kalku. Very good, very good. See Raiquen? Luck is on my side this time, The levisterio is finally going back to the hands of someone who is not afraid to unleash all of his power. The hands of a true wizard! Nahuel! What were you doing outside so late? Dad! You won't believe what happened today! No more excuses Nahuel But dad.. Listen to me Nahuel. First of all, you don't help at the cove and as a fisherman I can't even say a word. Your teacher called, very worried, because you didn't showed up to school today. And on top of everything you come home late, at this hour. I'm done of this nonsense Nahuel. Did you brought the eggs at least? No. - But dad, let me explain... - Enough! I don't know what else to do with you Nahuel. I think I can't keep taking care of you. Maybe it will be better if you stay with aunt Elvira, and your cousins in Puerto Montt for a while. What? Puerto Montt? Last time my cousins locked me in the bathroom for two hours. I'm sorry Nahuel you leave me no choice Please dad, don't do this to me. I'll be more responsible, I promise. There's nothing else to talk about, go to your room! The book! For out of the ordinary upgrowth... Increase, enlarge, I command you! What once was, will be no more! A giant among others! Ten times your shadow you'll be! - Be quiet Nahuel, go to sleep. - Yes, yes dad. Good night! The book... It's real! "Bravery incantation". To forget about phobias and fears for a whole day. This is it! This is the solution! Dad! Dad wait! Nahuel? I... I made it! Nahuel, are you okay? You could have hurt yourself! What are you doing here? I have been thinking about what you said yesterday, and you are right dad. So I came to fish with you, so... you won't have to send me to my aunt's. Fine then, start by arranging those ropes. And don't ever jump into the boat like that again. At your command, captain! What was about that crane Nahuel, it was too close! You almost got the cabin destroyed! - Can you bring me some coffee, son? - Yes dad. Thanks. Dad? Did mom used to come fishing with you? Sometimes. How was she like, mom? She... She was... - Dad? - It's time to go back to work. And this bird? Why is so far from land? Nahuel! Put the life vest on. It will be better if we leave. Get the anchor up. Move beast! Dad! The panel is not working! Let me help you! What the... I'll try to raise the anchor by hand go to the cabin, communicate with land. Yes dad! Nahuel! Nahuel! Nahuel! Are you okay? Nahuel! Out, leave him alone! Out, out! - Dad! - Come on Nahuel I don't know what they want from us. Hold on Nahuel! - Nahuel! - Dad! - Dad! - Nahuel! Nahuel! Dad! Dad! Wait! Don't get up so fast. Fresia, bring the herbs we made. Rest little boy. Drink it while is still warm - Where am I? - You are in "Island Escondida". My name is Huenchur, and i'm a Machi A witch? Yeah! But I'm a good one! Don't worry. She is Fresia, my apprentice. What's your name? My name is Nahuel. I can't remember much. What happened to me? Nahuel, your boat was attacked by a sorcerer, very powerful one, I would say. You shipwrecked, the current brought you to our island. You were very lucky kid! Now tell me. Was there someone else with you? Dad? My dad, where's my dad? It was just you at the beach! Nahuel, listen to me. I think you father is still alive, but he's in serious danger. Sorcerers take the victims of shipwrecks for their own dark purposes. It's because of the book right? The sorcerer is trying to get the Levisterio. It's a very wanted and powerful book. I shouldn't have taken it. This is all my fault. Huenchur, I've got to go right now. I must find my dad Take it easy kid, this island is not like the others, and you don't know the dangers awaiting out there. We'll think about something later, rest first. Birds! - Fresia! Go over there. - Huenchur! Tell me where can I find the sorcerer, and how do I face him? I don't know where he hides and you can't defeat him, kid. Huenchur, please help me! He is my dad. Is my dad Sorcerers are powerful beings but also super ambitious, and you have something he desires, Nahuel There's a chance to save your father, but listen to me, very carefully. Don't let him get the book. Fresia, Fresia! I need you here. You will go with Nahuel. Go to the forest and find the place I told you about. Witch! I know you are hiding the boy, so let's not waste our time, and give me what im looking for. It's a "Voladora", the sorcerer's assistant. I don't know what are you talking about! But I'll be thankful if you take those birds away. They are destroying my humble home. Go hide in the back You don't fool me Machi, give me the Levisterio now! Don't make this harder Give me the book, or die. Kids, run! Let's go Nahuel, don't stay behind. - You'll regret this witch. - No, Voladora! Who'll regret getting into my house is you. I hope this is enough. Thanks Nahuel, we'll make good fire with these. What is that? These are magical fire stones. Huenchur gave them to me. Can I try? Okay, but be careful because... It's a cuchivilu! - A what? - Run! The book! Nahuel, get up here! Hurry up! Nahuel! That was very stupid! These beasts can be very dangerous. A dog, a talking dog! You came across a four hundred pounds Cuchivilu. And you are surprised by a talking dog? Where are your priorities boy? You are Ruende right? Ruende, the incantated dog. The cursed dog you mean. I've heard your story You and your girlfriend were attacked by a Sorcerer. You fought for her, but it was too late. that night you lost your human form and the love of your life. Something like that. Kalku. His name is Kalku, who you are looking for. He's the only dark sorcerer that haunts this island. Kalku. Wait. Why do you know so much about us? Nahuel, he's just saved our life. I think we can trust him. You want to find your dad, and I need to reverse this curse. Nahuel, we both have unfinished business with that demonic. So what do you say? Do you accept a new team-mate? Hey Nahuel! Look at Ruende He doesn't seem so bad, right? Yeah, I would like to take him for a walk. Or rub his belly! Try it and you'll lose a hand. Go to sleep, now! We have a long way ahead tomorrow. Little brats... Nahuel... Can I ask you something personal? Yeah, I think so. The Levisterio... Why do you have it? What for? - I guess I wanted to please my dad. - Your dad? Yes. I wanted to prove him that I could get on a boat and be a fisherman, like him! I had never been on a boat before untill yesterday. Truth is, I am very scared of the sea. Thought I could use the book to fix the problem, but I made it worst You know, I was afraid of the dark, very much, Nahuel. I thought I would overcome the fear. But Huenchur helped me. She encouraged me to face it, little by little. And taught me that to overcome the darkness, you just need to light up a little light. You are very lucky Fresia. Huenchur really likes you. I'm sure you dad loves you too, Nahuel. And we will find him. I hope so Fresia, I hope so. Nahuel... Hey, somebody! Open the door! Hey, let me out! I need to find my son! Hey! You woke up very energized, I see. Listen, I don't know who you are. Or why are you keeping me in here. But I must go right now, my son can be anywhere! - I need to find my so- - Shut up! I don't care. I don't wanna hear you whine about your stupid kid. Must admit, I like your enthusiasm. But it would be better if you save all that energy for another day. By now, enjoy the stay. I'll figure what to do with you later. Let me out! I need to find my son, Nahuel! Fresia? Fresia! You have grown so much! Sure you don't remember me. My name is Elzaíno, many years ago I had an pretty bad accident, and Huenchur took care of me. But tell me! How is the old witch? - Fine - I'm glad! Well kids... What can I do for you? We are looking for Kalku, the sorcerer. We must find him. Listen to me I don't care why are you looking for a sorcerer like Kalku, but you can't just go around, and ask about him like that. You are scaring my clients away. Besides, of course I don't know where he's hiding. The sorcerer has the kid's father, and he owes me a few. Please sir. Is for my dad Will you help us Elzaíno? Fine! Stay here for the night, and help me around in the hostel. We have all kids of creatures and sailors from all the islands around here. So you might find something if you ask between tables. But remember, be careful. Nahuel! - Did you find something? - Nothing yet, you? Me neither. They all get scared when I mention the sorcerer's name. - Hey girl! Where's my food? - On my way! Don't give up, there has to be someone willing to help us. I'll go with her, don't trust these people. Hey kid! Give me a hand here. This is for the sir, at the corner. He is The Trauco, a dangerous hermit living in the woods. if there is someone who knows about sorcerers and incantations, that's him. Your food sir. You lost something? No sir. - I just... - Then leave! What are you waiting for? Excuse me sir, I am looking for information about Kalku, the sorcerer. Do you know where to find him? Why do you wanna know that? I must face him to rescue my father. Excuse me! I just heard the funniest joke of my life! The kid you see right here, just asked me where to find Kalku. Because he wants to defeat him! Don't laugh! You'll see! I'm going to find that horrible sorcerer and rescue my father. And how do you think you are gonna do that, brat? With those tiny skinny arms hanging off your shoulders? - Nahuel wait! - With this! It's the book! It's the Levisterio. The magic book? So you are looking for Kalku, little kid. I admire your bravery. You are not like these beasts and 'so called' men of the sea. Don't let their laughters get to you. If you know where to find him, please tell me. Of course I will. but only if you accept to play a little riddle game with me. A bet? That's it little fisherman! You are not just brave, but also smart. If you win, I'll tell you where to find the sorcerer. But if you lose, I will keep the book. Don't do it Nahuel! He's a trickster and bootlicker demon! So, what do you say boy? I'll do it. Okay. We are having a bet, gentlemen! - Yeah! - Come on kid! Let's start then. I will make three riddles. .If you guess two, you win Otherwise, I will. Got it? Very well! I am walking not owner of my feet Backwards my body goes, dragging my spine with it. Who am I? I am walking not owner... Seems like it's going to be easier than I thought. I know! It's a boat! Very good, very good. Didn't expect less from you. Now is when we really start. Sometimes my head goes on the loose, and questions I whisper into the darkness. Covered in stars I go, but even if I stand in front of your eyes, I promise you'll never see me. Who am I? Come on kid! I don't have all night. Your answer... - What can it be? - Oh, come on! I am putting it easy for you! You really don't see it? I... don't... Me! I am the answer! The Chon-Chon. Is not fair! You just made that up! No one would answer that! Who said it was going to be easy, girl? Okay kid this is the last one. If you get this wrong, the Levisterio goes with me. But if I win, you'll tell me how to get to Kalku. No beast or man want to face me, even the oak will bend for me. One hundred silver spears I carry with me. That not even the rock can stop. And if my flames cross the sky, my howls will make you cry. Too hard? Let me think! Not even the rock can't stop me. I will give you ten more seconds. Think wisely little fisherman. And if my flames cross the sky, my howls will make you cry... Cry... Cry... Time is up. What's you answer? The storm. Yes kid! Well done Nahuel! Well played kiddo! But to face Kalku you are gonna need more than luck. Don't worry for my luck, demon. Now keep your word. Go to Puerto Esperanza and look at the horizon. An old lighthouse far away you will see, high and tall, the sorcerer you will find. But don't give yourself too much credit. Even with the Llevisterio, you are nothing but a simple fisherman in the end. A toast for the kid who defeated Chon-Chon, the trickster. Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! The Levisterio is gone, someone stole it! But who could have done it? It was the Trauco, Fresia. That thieve and filthy hermit! Are you sure? Maybe you left it downstairs. I am sure! - I need to get that book back now! - Nahuel wait! Keep walking to the right a few kilometers, that's the only hovel you'll find. Elzaíno, thanks for everything. - Nahuel? Nahuel! what are you doing? - I am going to get the Levisterio back! Wait Nahuel, I think you are wrong about the Trauco Wait! Wait! I feel like something very bad is going to happen with Kalku. We must go to the lighthouse, now. Now is not just your father who's in danger Nahuel. Everyone is in danger I am sorry Fresia, but if i want to rescue my father, I need the book. Remember what the demon said. Kalku is on an island and you already know my situation. Without the bravery incantation I won't make it. I need to get that book now! Nahuel, wait! This is not looking good. We should go with him. No, you go with him. Make sure you get to Puerto Esperanza at sunset. The Levisterio has to be somewhere here, Ruende. I am sure. Nahuel... We have to go now. I haven't found it yet Ruende. What are you doing here intrudors? You are not welcome! - Give me back what you stole Trauco! - What are you talking about kid? Do you see any valuable objects around here? Stop lying you liar! Last night you came into my room and stole the Levisterio. Here here is the proof! You found it! Last night I lost it in the middle of the party! Besides... It would make me a very dumb thieve, if i had left that in the crime scene. Don't you think? Is true Nahuel, the scarf shas a different smell. Showing off that book was very dumb kiddo. So... Who has the Levisterio? On the house. You know I didn't came here for this. Yes I hope this is what you are looking for? Finally, mine! I guess, with this... The threat of cursing my humble hostel, goes away. Curse your hostel you say? No, no, no innkeeper. I have better and more ambitious plans. Wait! What are you going to do with that? What I'm going to do now? I'm never going to see my dad again. I'm going to be alone, forever. Just what I needed! First, you sneak into my house to snoop around my stuff like rats, and now you cry like a baby. You are nothing but coward and dumb kid after all. I am sorry Trauco, I thought you were the thieve. It's true, I am nothing but a coward and dumb kid. Hey, kiddo! Don't listen to me! There's nothing wrong with you. Tell me, why do you care so much about that book? Without the bravery incantation that is on that book, I'll never get on a boat. And I won't be able to go to the island where Kalku is, and rescue my father. You need an incantation to get on a boat? I am very scared of the sea. You know kid, from where I come, we have a saying about fears. As I was saying... Don't let them get to you. The only way to defeat them, is to face them where they live. And that's exactly what you are gonna do. Come on kid, my arm is getting tired. Come on Nahuel, there's nothing to lose. Now, relax. And let yourself go... Put your mind blank, let the sound show you the way. The solution to your problem... Go... Go... Without fear... I love these mornings. The sun, the sea breeze... It's beautiful, don't you think? Yes. I guess so, yes. I wish we had more time, but it's time to go Nahuel. Go, where? To find for you father, of course. My dad? Wait! - Come, get on the boat with me Nahuel. - No. Come on, Nahuel! Antonio is waiting for us. No! It's okay, don't be afraid. No... I can't... Nahuel! Nahuel! I can't! I can't! Nahuel, listen to me. Yes, you can! You are a brave and wonderful, and you will always be my beautiful son. Mom? You have come so far Nahuel. I am so proud of you! From now on, you must know you are not alone my son. You have never been. I am always taking care of you. Now it's time to go Nahuel. Your father needs you, everyone needs you. You can do it You can. - Fresia! - Nahuel? - Fresia! - You came back! Fresia, you were right! Trauco didn't had the book. - I'm sorry. - It doesn't matter anymore. But it does matter! You said something wrong was going to happen! What was it? I saw it in my dream Nahuel. The sorcerer is gonna wake the god of the sea up, to cause a flooding. We must go, right now. Are you ready? What is this place? An abandoned whaling lot. It's the perfect place for a sorcerer's nest. Kalku. - It is the Voladora! - Ruende, be careful! Ruende? Raiquén? She... She's the girlfriend. Run! Fresia! Nahuel, over there. Go and find your father! - But Fresia... - No one leaves! Ruende! Leave now, we'll take care of this. Nahuel! Nahuel! - Nahuel! - Dad? Dad! Can you hear me? Dad! Nahuel! Dad! Nahuel! Dad! Nahuel! Dad! Dad! Here I am! - Nahuel! - Dad? - You are not my son! - Dad? Dad is me, Nahuel! My son died in the sea! Dad is me, your son! - It's me, Nahuel! - You are not my son! Dad! - My son died in the sea - Dad! Dad, no! Dad... You are not my son! My son died in the sea! You are not my... ...son. - Dad wake up, dad! - My son died in the sea! Antonio! Consuelo! Nahuel, son... Dad? Here I am... Nahuel? Nahuel! Thought I had lost you! The sorcerer said you had drowned. But you are okay! You are okay! What a joy! Dad, this is my fault. I did something I shouldn't have done. And I caused all of this. I'm so sorry. No son, who should apologize is me. I'm sorry for not being a better father, Nahuel. Son, I love you so much. We have leave this place Nahuel. We can't leave yet. The sorcerer is going to destroy everything. We must stop him! What? No... I'm not going to put you at risk, Nahuel We are leaving. Dad! This is my responsibility. I caused all of this. And I have to fix it. Nahuel! Ruende! Stop it, I don't want to hurt you. Go with Nahuel, I'll take care of this. Wake from the eternal sleep! Abandon the abyssal cave! Drop that book sorcerer! The fisherman and his son? You came to take the book from me, brat? Then come and get it! Above the mountains, rise! Unleash the raging power of the sea! Dad! Where are you going fisherman? Dad? Dad, no! Nahuel! Dad! No, no, no, no... No, no! Dad! Who invokes you, you shall obey! You belong to me now! Finally, absolute power! Now come, and show me your power! Kalku! What? Let go of me! The Levisterio! - The spell! - No! What have you done! Raiquén! Please wake up, Raiquén! Raiquén! Raiquén! Let go off me, kid! That's enough! I have awaken you. And you'll obey my will! Kalku! You thought you could defeat me? Stupid kid! Annoying like your father! And now you will end just like him! What? Machi! Nahuel! Nahuel! Fresia! Fresia! What was the plan Machi? Defeat me with sparkles? You'll be food for my new god! - Nahuel! - Fresia! The light! I can't do it! I can't! My eyes! How dare you! Fresia! Nahuel! No! The book... The book!! No! I got you! Fresia! Fresia! - I have to save her! - Nahuel Wait! Nahuel! Nahuel? Nahuel! - The Levisterio... - It doesn't matter! We are okay! It's over, Fresia! Nahuel! Nahuel! Dad! Fresia! Nahuel? - Nahuel! - Dad! Don't scare me like that ever again! No, dad. Thanks! So, that was the god of the sea? He doesn't seem so bad. Shall we go dad? Hey, nice to find you! Ruende? Hello! - Ruende! - Ruende! What a joy! Revised and Synchronized by FAST TITLES MEDIA
