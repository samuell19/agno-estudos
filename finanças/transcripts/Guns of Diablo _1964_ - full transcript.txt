Keep those wagons rolling! Keep the wagons moving! Keep them moving! Keep 'em moving! Look out for the log! Tom! Jump! He's doing as well as can be expected. His leg is broken and the Lord knows what else. You go get some rest. If it's possible, I'd like to keep them still for the next few days. A rolling wagon... Well, we're all a little tired. So are the animals. You can rest them. I want you people to settle down. We're gonna rest over for a couple of days. I understand there's a town about 30 miles from here. I can get out some mail, pick up supplies. Town's called Devil's Gap, I believe. Can I go with you, Linc? I promise I won't be any trouble. Can I, father? Well, now, I hate to lose such a viable assistant, but... Oh, thanks! On one condition: If there's a barbering shop in Devil's Gap, he gets a bath. A bath? A-ha. A bath. With soap. Well? All right. Good. I probably won't recognize you as my son when you get back. Jamie, we'll leave with sun up tomorrow. Well, you better get to bed now. Yes, sir. All these places look the same to me. Yeah, they don't change much. I don't think I'd like to live in any of them. Too cramped up. I was born in a town like this. I... I guess when you know the people, and everything... That's all right, Jamie. I was glad to leave it. Howdy, friends. How do you do? Howdy. Who handles the mail around here? You're looking at him. Ives is the name. Ives. Jamie, take the animals across the street. Have them feed and water them. You might drop this list off at the supply store. Tell them to start filling it. Fine looking lad. Yours? Nope. You can throw your mail on the desk here. Now, how about a little drink? First one's on the house. I'll have a beer. But I'll pay for it. Well, suit yourself. A Wells Fargo man's due pretty soon. Ives, could you take this soup up to Mr. Knudsen's room? I got... Take this to Mr. Knudsen. I thought you were dead. It's like seeing a ghost. I don't know what you've come here for, but whatever it is, finish it and get out. Men in the store said they're out of supplies, Linc. I'm changing my mind, Jamie. We're staying over. You mean we're gonna stay in a hotel? That's right. Maybe you'll have a chance to get a bath and some sanitation. What's the matter? Nothing. Then why are you staring at her like that? I suppose you think she's pretty. She's someone I knew once. She don't act like it. Like she's glad to see you, or anything. Come on, let's get cleaned up. That, uh, fellow. A friend of yours? No. Well, I kinda got the feeling you two knew each other. I didn't say I didn't know him. I said he wasn't a friend. Get somebody to clean up in here, it's filthy. Is everything all right? Eh? Ahh! It's hot! Oh! You've come to Mendez for a hot bath, you get a hot bath. What are you gonna do with that? Oh, you'll find out pretty quick. Oh! Hey, hold on. What do you think you're doing? Stop pushing, eh? You have a skin like a hippopotamus. Rough and dry. Ow! Ahh. When was the last time you took a hot bath, huh? At Paducah. Paducah? Who is Paducah? Paducah, Kentucky. It's where I come from. Ohh. There you are. All right. Now, you listen to me. You take this brush and you scrub yourself all over, just the way I show you. And then you wash your hair, with plenty of soap and plenty of muscle. You understand? Sure. All right. Here. Is everything okay? Yeah, fine. Say, that woman back there at the hotel, is she married to that man, Ives? Ives? Whoa. No, no, señor. He wish he was married to her. Maria Macklin. A fine woman, I tell you. Macklin? Rance Macklin? Sí... You know Rance? Oh, one time. His brothers with him? Sure. Dan and Carey. You know them too? I knew them. So... You think your hair is clean now? Oh, yes, sir, very clean. Ah. We find out, huh? Very good. Now, you go over there and dry yourself. Here's a towel. Go on. Go on, move. I didn't see the Macklins around. Well, they're around, all right. I see them right out yesterday on some, uh, business, I think. You, uh... A friend of the Macklins? I wouldn't say so. You? So, let me see. Come... Don't... Come back here. What is the matter with you? Huh? Let me look at you. You pass inspection. Very good. Very good. You expect to stay in town long? Uh, I ain't made up my mind yet. Why? Well, there's nothing much here for men to do. It's very quiet. Yeah, not much going on in this town for anyone. Empty hotel, no bank, no stage line. No law either, señor. It's not like the Macklins to settle down in a dead town. What else? I live here, señor. What about Maria Macklin? Where does she fit in? She's married to Rance. Not much a woman can do. I feel for her. That Rance, he can get pretty mean when he drinks. He can hit pretty good, too. Even with one arm. One arm? Sure. That fellow shoot the other one off, a long time ago. Why? Why would a woman like Maria marry him in the first place? I wouldn't know that. Let's go, Linc. You go on, Jamie, back to the hotel. I'll be along in a couple of minutes. Sure ain't hurting my feelings none to get out of this place. Ives! Ives! Thinks he can order me around like a two bit flunky. Hold your horses, grampa, I'll be up there when I'm ready. Who is he? Well, if you wanna believe me, he owns all the gold in California. You mean he's struck out rich out there? Well, that's what he says. But if he's got more than two coins to rattle together in his pocket, I ain't seen them. Well, maybe if I was to, uh, go up there and see what he wants... You see, me and my father, we're going to California, and I'd sure like to talk to him. Sure, go ahead. But don't expect no tip for your trouble. A person could die before a body would think of looking in on him. Ives! Ives! It was about time. Come in. Who are you? Jamie McPheeters. Is there anything I can get you? Yes, there is. Tell that blunder head downstairs to bring me another pitcher of beer. That one's empty. Yes, sir, I'll get it for you. I ain't seen you before. You work here? No, I'm just spending the night in the hotel with Mr. Murdock. Oh, well. You bring me a pitcher of beer and I'll give you a penny for your trouble. It ain't no trouble. And you don't have to give me anything. What's the matter? You all right? Pills... on the table. Get 'em. Here. Water. Here. Ah. Thank you, boy. Thank you. That was a sharp one. I'm all right. You can bring the beer now. If you'll excuse me, sir, I don't think you should be drinking beer on your condition. What do you know about my condition? Well, it's real plain to see you're suffering from some kind of sickness. Maybe I could tell what it is if you let me examine you. Examine me? Well, sure. I'll just take off your boot and then put them back. No! No! Leave the boots on! If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die with my boots on. Do you understand me? Yes, sir. You got a watch? Of course I have a watch. It's over there on the table. I'm gonna take your pulse, sir. There's nothing to worry about. This ain't gonna hurt a bit. I've done this lots of times before. A bit rapid, I'd say. Just how long have you been practicing medicine? I just kinda picked it up from my father, but he's better than I am. Well, there don't seem to be no fever. Let me see your tongue. What? Your tongue. It's purple! I ain't never seen nothing like it. Maybe it's because you just gave me a purple pill. I just didn't think of it. Now, if you'll let me unbutton your shirt, I'll listen to your... No, no, no. Put that off till later. Believe me, I feel wonderful since you examined me. What did you say your name was? Jamie. Jamie McPheeters. Well, I'm very happy to make your acquaintance, Jamie McPheeters My name is Knudsen. Marquand Knudsen. Now, that thing is empty. What about the pitcher of beer we were talking about? Well... Sir, I don't think you better, in your condition, like I told you... Please. I know I'm going against your medical advice. But just this once, huh? How about it? Half a pitcher? Well... All right, I'll settle for that. Half. Like my father says, cutting down's better than cutting out. "Cutting down's better than cutting out." Give me another one. Close the place up, I'm going to bed I'll take care of it. Good night. Good night. That's a dollar. You, uh, turning in? Yeah. Well, see you in the morning. Good morning. Good morning. Do you have a little trouble? Yes, ma'am. My horse broke his leg two days ago and I had to shoot it. Two days ago. You've been walking all that time? Yes, ma'am. Who does the hiring around here, ma'am? Oh. That'd be Mr. Macklin. Do you mind if I help myself to some of the water, ma'am? That's what it's there for. And you don't have to keep ma'aming me, I mean, I work around here myself. I... My father works for Mr. Macklin. Oh, let me do that. You probably haven't eaten either, have you? I killed a couple of rabbits on the way. Thank you. I'll take that. Oh, I can. I can handle them both, ma'am. My name's Maria. Maria Girard. Linc Murdock. Where are you from? Oh, no place special. Where are you going? I haven't thought about it much. Traipsing? You can say the rest. The rest? Saddle tramp. I didn't say that. No, you didn't. You can put the pails down here. I'll take them to Mr. Macklin. I'd like to pick up the saddle first. I was ahead of you till he got in the way. I win, didn't I? Give me the money. I got pushed out. Now, get him off my back. I'm gonna make him pay for it, huh? You made me lose that race. I ought to take it out of your hide. You fellas just about ran all over me. Well, if I knew I was gonna lose, I would have. Let's make him pay for it. I don't care who pays for it as long as I get paid. All right. Ten bucks. Kick in. No, I'm sorry. I can't help you, fellas. I'm here looking for a job to pick up a horse. A real saddle bum, huh? Pick up your saddle and move out. He's been walking for two days. He had to shoot his horse. Then he can move for two more days. Get moving before I throw you out. A man should always do what he feels. Well, d'you hear what I heard? Yes, I heard, but I saw him first. Oh no, wait a minute. I'm your older brother. I got first shots. Okay, mister, you picked me. Any time you're ready. Anybody wanna take a bet? Two to one. Sucker money. Hey, don't tell me you're gonna get scared and crawl. No, I'm just looking for a safe place to put the saddle. Maybe he's not so yellow after all. Get up! Wanna double that bet, then? Good bye, ma'am. I guess I'd better move on. Wait a minute. Pick him up. You say you're looking for a job? That's right. I'm Ray Macklin. I own this place. You're hired. My sons sometimes let things run away with them. Rance had it coming to him. Nobody asked him to come here. I saw what happened. Get yourself emplaced in the bunkhouse and wash up. You can eat with us, for the time, anyhow. After dinner, see that he gets a horse for himself. I'll take care of it. Who's the flunky that's giving me a horse? That's my father. Well, there's no fool like a man who puts his foot in his own mouth. Where is the bunkhouse? Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! I said it before, I'll say it again. I don't like a saddle tramp eating at the same table with me. Sightseeing around like he owns the place. Why can't he stay with the rest of the men up at the line cabin? As long as I'm alive, I'll decide who goes and who stays. You're mad at Murdock 'cause he licked you. I tell you, I could use three more like him. He's the best hand I've ever had. You're late. Oh, those are cold. I saved some hot for you. Let José do it, you don't have to wait on him. I think you'll like these better. Thanks. I'd like to go to town tomorrow, if you don't mind. I have to pick up a few personals for myself. As a matter of fact, there are a few things you can do for me while you're in town. You can take some money to the bank. Cash sales of some cattle. Pa, me and Rance and Carey are going to town in the morning. We can take that money to the bank. I've already said Murdock could do it. All right, I'm not afraid to say it. How long have you known him, three weeks? How do you know you can trust him? It's my money, I'll take my chances. I know. It hurts. Yeah. It's all right, though. The last thing I remember is getting knocked off my horse. How did I get here? Your horse came back... By itself. And so, we went out looking for you. Rance too? No. José and myself. Who took my clothes off? I did. You were unconscious, and there was no one here to help me. Now, I'm going to put this bandage around you but you'll have to help me. Uh... It'll hurt. I think one of your ribs is cracked. Ooh. Hurts ain't no to me. You have to lift up because I have to slide this under. I'm sorry. It's all right, little one, because I felt your breath on me. Ain't that something? This isn't good, Linc. You have to get out of here before... before it's too late. It's already too late, Maria. You know it and I know it. It... it can't be. I have to marry Rance. Oh, I've seen you look at him. There's nothing there. I've seen your face when he touches you. You look like you could crawl out of your skin. Maria, you can't marry him. I have to. Why? Because of your father? Macklin will see that your father doesn't starve. Maria, you've got something coming to you, too. You're a woman. You're not made of stone. If you stay here, there's only one way it can end. There are three of them. They nearly killed you today. How'd you know about that? I found the wire. If it had been any higher... You would be dead right now. I would rather turn to stone than have that happen. Maria, you know this had to happen from the day I walked on this ranch. Oh, no. I... I... Oh, why did you have to come here? Please, go away from here. Morning. Morning. Now, why aren't you out there mending that fence? I'm leaving, Mr. Macklin. And I came in to settle up. I'm sorry you're going, Murdock. And there's nothing to settle up. Well, I owe you for a horse. You don't owe me for anything. It's just too bad it had to work out this way. Well, a man can't go against his own sons. Good bye, Murdock. I, uh... I just happen to be selfish enough to want her for Rance. He needs her. He father needs her, your son needs her. Everyone needs her. Anybody ever think what she might need? You said it yourself. A man can't go against his own sons. Sure, Mr. Macklin. Good bye. Came to say good bye. That's what you want, isn't it? Yes. Turn around. I said everything there was to say last night. Please go. Ah, Maria. Go away, Linc. There's nothing you can say that will change anything. Ahh! Let go! You think saving yourself for Rance will make it better. Don't talk to me like that. You're hurting me. I'm gonna keep on hurting you until you tell me what you really feel. No! What are you afraid of? Me. Only me. Don't you understand? Oh, Maria, I don't wanna hurt you. I don't wanna hurt you. You're shaking all over. The Mescaleros have a word for this: testarte. It means a lot of things, but mainly it's something between two people. It's when everything's right between a man and a woman, because nothing's wrong. Like us. Now, you tell me I'm wrong. No... Oh. No. No. It's getting late. Let it. There are things to be done. If we start out soon, we can make Lynchburg in about a day and a half. And we can be married there. Married? Sure. What did you think I was talking about? Now, you don't think I'm gonna leave you here for Rance? You know, Maria, it's gonna be rough to start. I don't know what I'm gonna do, and I don't know where I'm gonna go. But we'll make it. I'm not afraid. Well, I guess we'd better go tell them. No, no. Not that way. I'll tell just my own father, and no one else. Then tonight we can leave when everybody's asleep. I have my own horse. It kinda makes me feel like, uh, sneaking. I know. I don't like it either. But if anything happened to you... Well... I'd want it to happen to me too. I'll be waiting for you. Ohh. I think I've been... Waiting for you. All my life. Maria? No! You shot her. You killed her. Carey, don't shoot. Maria. Maria. I told you she's dead, you killed her yourself. There's no sense in killing me, it ain't gonna bring her back. Either you fires a shot, I'm gonna finish you all off. All right, we're not shooting. Carey, hold it. Get out of here. Maria? Get out of here, Linc, I don't wanna see you. I wanna talk to you. You let me in or I'll break this door down You are a fool, go away. I'm coming in. Wait. José, José, wake up, wake up. Now listen, I want you to settle up, and take this note to Señor Rance, understand? Go pronto, pronto. You thought I was dead and that's why you kept on going. Now would you please get out or here? That's all, just like that. What did you expected, that I'd fall into your arms? Well, I thought it might mean something to you, yes. Why? Would it change anything? Would it, wipe out five years of the fact that you left me to Rance. You thought I ran out on you? I waited for you, you never came, what else was I to think? So you married him? You forgot that I was engaged to Rance? You mean traded. And so your father could hang under that job of his. You where gone, Rance was there. A bird in hand, huh? You didn't come back, I waited for you, but you didn't came back. It had to take the arm off. He was like a man out of his mind, kept calling for me, his father and his brothers came to me. My own father didn't had to say anything, but I knew what he wanted. I married him, a month later. What happened to the Macklin ranch? Mr. Macklin died, and the boys took it over. Ran it into the ground in a year. Borrowed on it, 'till there was nothing left. Carry got into a gunfight. Killed the man, so when the Marshalls came for him we all did out just left the place, never went back. Maria, why do you stay with him? I'm married. Do you love him? I'm gonna take you out of here. And how far do you think we'll get? I'm gonna kill Rance for what he's done to you, to us, Or he'll kill me, here or some place else, it doesn't matter but I'm gonna kill him. What makes you think that I want him dead? What he has to do to you before you've had enough? If I ever leave him, it will not be for you. You're lying. No, you're the one who's running from the truth, Linc. The past is gone, we cannot bring it back. Five years, Linc, five years I have been dead to you, and you have been dead to me. So if you really want to do something for me, you could, get out now, before Rance comes back and it all starts over again and this time for nothing. My mistake. I'll be leaving in the morning. And you won't have to worry, I won't be back. No good, huh? No, sir. Ah, me bucko. You outsmarted yourself that time. You have to jump. I hate to do this to you, but... Oh, dammit, dammit! How much now? Well, I figure I owe you 25000, 35, Thirty-seven thousand dollars. Thirty-seven thousand! You'll have to take my IOU. Oh, I know what you're thinking, That I'm a big bag of wind. Oh no, sir, I... It's only natural, it's only natural. What's a millionaire like me, doing in a flee bag like this? Well, I'll tell you, they took me off the stage, five weeks ago, five weeks ago, mind you. And I was headed back East to buy me a mansion. A mansion? Yes, Jamie, but let me tell you something. This ain't no place to get sick. The people around here are miserable. Jamie That's Mr. Murdock. I'm coming, Linc. Come on, time to get going. This is Mr. Knudsen Mr. Marquand Knudsen. And he's a millionaire. Oh, he's a millionaire, is he? How do you do? Howdy? Come on. Goodbye, Jamie. Goodbye, Mr. Knudsen. And I'll write you. Yeah. Have a nice trip, gentlemen. Thanks. Ain't it too bad we have to go just as we're getting to know everybody? Well, it is time to leave. Before we come to know 'em too well. Going some place, Linc? Murdock, Rance is going to be riding in pretty soon. Now, you wouldn't want to miss seeing him, wouldn't ya'? Don't change what he is, does he? He's ugly as ever. Take his gun, Ives. Now, there's no need for that. I didn't came here looking for trouble. Get the gun, Ives. All right, Murdock. Inside, would you? What are you gonna do? Nevermind, son, you're going inside with him. Go on. Let's do as he says. All right, Murdock, get over there on the bar. Now, leave here, Ives and get us a bottle of whiskey we've been riding all night. Sit down, Murdock, sit down. Come on, Ives, come on. It ain't nothing like good whiskey when you've been eating dust all night. Linc, how did you happen to show up here? When the wagon's were in. We came here for supplies. Must've been quite a surprise for the both of you. Maria, start moving some vittles. Say, this boy has nothing to do with this. Let him get back to the wagon train. I ain't gonna leave you Linc, wha... Son, you mind your manners. You talk when you're spoken to. What do you think, Carey? You're inviting trouble in the other way. If that boy don't show up at the wagon train, They'll all be out after him. Well, there's something about what he says, Dan. Yeah, could work the other way too. The boy shows and then the whole wagon train comes back looking for Murdock. Now, I think the boy stays, we'll let Rance decide what he wants to do with you when he gets back. Now, you got any other questions, man? You're calling the shots. I swear I've never seen you so obliging, Murdock. Maria, you got them vittles ready? Turn the fire, it'll take a few minutes. Well in that case I think I'll just watch out. Wait. Now, get him out of here, throw him back in that store room, I don't want to see his ugly face while I'm eating. I'll take that. I've told you for the last time... Let him alone, he's only a boy. All right, but get him off of my back, If he causes me any more trouble, I'm gonna throw him in that store room with Murdock. I'll watch him. You watch him good, Maria. If he tries to sneak of to that wagon train for help I'm not gonna wait for Rance to get back. Now go on, get out of here. What do you think they're going to do to Linc? I don't know. You used to be friends with him, didn't you? Yes, long time ago. He likes you, I can tell. How can you not like him anymore? Just wash your dishes. Was that before you married Rance? I think you ask too many questions you don't understand. I do understand. I think I do. They're mad at Linc because they think you still like him and that's why they wanna kill him, don't they? Are you gonna let 'em? Are you? Ives! Take this tray up to Mr. Knudsen's room. I can take it. You better stay right here. Oh, I just want to play a little checkers with him. You know what'll happen to Linc if you try to run away? Oh, I know, you don't have to worry none about me, honest. If it was me, I'll take him with his pal where I know where it'd be. Please? All right, go on, take it. Thanks. Thank you, Mrs. Macklin. Mr. Knudsen, Mr. Knudsen, it's me, Jamie. Come in. I heard what happened. Them lily-livered skunks. They're a bunch of tinhorns. You got a gun? Oh, if I only did, I'd show 'em. Can I use your window? Go ahead, help yourself. Excuse me. Linc?, Linc. Jamie. Linc, are you all right? What are you doing here? Do they know that you're out? They think I'm at Mr. Knudsen's room I wanna do something to help you. You can't. Go find yourself a horse and get back to the wagon train as fast as you can. But they're gonna kill you, maybe if you'd had a gun. Do like I tell you while you got the chance, now move. I ain't gonna let 'em kill you, Linc. Jamie, Jamie. There you are Señor Carey. Is everything all right, eh? Yeah, just... You clumsy baboon. You keep your blade like hacksaws. Mr. Mendez, I've gotta talk to you. What are you doing here? It's Mr. Murdock, he's in trouble and I got to get him a gun. A gun? Now you get out of here, go on, before you get me in trouble, go on, get out. But if I don't get him a gun they'll kill him. Please, Mr. Mendez, you gotta help me. And if I help you, they'll kill me. Mendez, he can help nobody. Go on, get out of here. Besides, I got no gun. Nobody around here got guns. The Macklins, they see to that. Get out. Hey kid! Hey kid. Ives, What's all the yelling about? Well, the kid, he's supposed to be in Knudsen's room. Well he better be there. Hello, Mr. Macklin, do you play checkers? Oh, I called you, now why didn't you answered? 'cause we weren't finished the game. He was coming right down. It's an outrage, busting in on a man in his own room. What kind of a place you're running? Go on, Ives. I... I'll tell you what kind of a place are we here, old man, it's a money place. And you better get yours up here pretty soon. And sonny, I want you to stay put, now you understand me? You stay put. Now gimme the water, Jamie. Here. Why did you go? I tried to get Mr. Mendez to give me a gun, said he didn't had one. I bet he was just too scared. Scared. They're a bunch of sheep, that's what they are. The Macklins got all of them shaking in their boots. Blasted heart, this blasted heart. If only I could get going again, I'd... I'd bash them on the face with a handle. But I can't, Jamie, I can't. I can't, Jamie, I can't Jamie, I can't! Uh, It's been a long day. I'm turning in. Ives, you be sure that crossbar isn't a place for you. Go out. I'm gonna turn in. I think I'm gonna stay down here for a little while. If I get tired, I'll call you. You're not worried about him. He can't get out of here, can't without help. Or are you thinking about Maria? She liked to him pretty good at one time. I just want to make sure she doesn't feels the same way. Well, tomorrow's the big day. Is a big day for Rance. Been waiting for it for six years. Linc. You can get out by the kitchen door downs on the porch. He's gone. Then chance it. I don't know, I couldn't leave without that boy. Don't be a fool, you can come back for him. I'm not gonna leave without that boy. They're gonna know how I got this gun, what happens to you? Nothing, I can handle Rance. The way you handle the money's drunk? A while ago I was poisoning you, what changed your mind? You know, Maria, one minute you're ready to lay a man off like he was dirt, the next minute you risk your life for him. Please, get out of here, get out of here. Let's not get ourselves killed before we're ready. Carry, Ives. All right, Murdock, You can come out now. Maria, come first. Mr. Knudsen, Mr. Knudsen, something's happening. Jamie, Jamie. What's up? Linc? If you got a gun on you, You'd make it easier on her by just sliding it out here on the end of the bar. But first, Now, we've got the boy upstairs. You stay right there, Maria. Pretty looking couple, ain't they? Yeah, sort of chokes me up. Hm, too bad one's our sister-in-law. You shouldn've not done it, Maria. Rance ain't gonna like it one bit. They ain't saying a word. I'm letting him down, I'm letting him down. You and me, Jamie. Caught in the middle. Too young and too old. Too young, too old. Shouldn't be too long now. Where is he? Inside. So is Maria. We caught them in the store room together. Like they've been in there long time, Rance She tried to help him get away. The old bunch. Just like old times, Linc, Rance, Maria. Good, old Maria. Faithful Maria. But not to me. Linc, I wouldn't. You see that? Ready to come for me just because I hit his woman. His woman, not my wife. You know something, Linc? She never was, she never was mine. Shut up. Why so touchy, Linc? Is all in the family. We've got nothing to hide. Go on Maria, tell him. Tell him how you sit down every night crying, because it's me instead of him. Go on, tell him. What do you expect, Rance? You knew why I married you, you where never lied about it. You knew I couldn't stand the sight of you. It took me just the same. I tried to be a wife to you, but you wouldn't let me. I even, tried to forget Linc. But you kept bringing him up. I guess it made you feel good to take someone that wasn't yours. It did, honey, it sure did. The one thing I'm sorry for, is that I didn't killed you. Sure, instead you made me half a man. You know how it's like to live in this country with only a left arm? You've ever tried drawing on a man with the left hand? You run, even if it's a kid. You run. But I've learned, I learned good. It's too bad I ain't gonna get the chance to find out. What's fair is fair. I'll give you the same chance you gave me. Give me his gun. It's waiting for you, on the street. Take care of her, Ives. Sure. Rance don't like to be kept waiting. Linc. I'm sorry that I got you into this, Maria I love you, Linc. Murdock! That'd make us even. Your left hand, my left hand. Even, Steven. A man couldn't want any more than that. Here's your gun. Go, get it. Move. Don't let the boys worry you none. They're just here to see it's a fair fight. Go on, pick it up. Linc, look out! Ah, dammit! Ah! Choke on that, Jamie! Mr. Knudsen. This just one shave you don't have to pay for, Señor. Linc, Linc. Hey, easy boy. Easy. You're heavy. Jesus, Jamie. Easy. Get some water. No use, I'm done. You should know that, doctor. Is he gonna die, Linc? A man's gotta die sometime. I've lived my life, You don't have to feel sorry for me, Jamie. No, sir. Got my boot shot too. Yes, sir. Take 'em off, Jamie. Off? But I thought you said... Take 'em off, easy. We certainly showed them mackerel-chomping, didn't we? We did just fine. You know? If I were to tell someone about it, they'd never believed me, never believed me. Like, you didn't believed me I was a millionaire. In the left boot, Jamie, a paper. Read it. United, States. United States Bureau of Mines Sacramento, California. This is the certifying. This is a duly recorded claim on a gold mine. Gold mine? El Dorado, The real one. Then you are a millionaire. He, To ours, Jamie. You keep it. We couldn't let them Macklins get it. You go, my boy. Mr. Knudsen? Mr. Knudsen? Ain't it funny, father? Here we are going to California to find gold and we already found it. Better not count your nuggets before they're hatch, Jamie. Mr. Knudsen told me. He ain't no liar, honest father, he was a wonderful man. I'm sure he was, Jamie. And nothing can change that, can it? No, Sir. But just the same, I know there's gold there. It's a long trip ahead of us. Think you can make it? I can make it. Stay beside me, Linc. ·
