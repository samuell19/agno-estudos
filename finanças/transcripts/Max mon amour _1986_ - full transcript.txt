Nelson. - Yes, Dad? - Would you answer that? If it's your grandmother, tell her I'm not in. Hello? Yes, hi. No, she's not in. I don't know. Who is it? It's for Mama. She's at Hélène's But it's Hélène who's phoning. Hello, Hélène? Margaret's not at your place? She was supposed to visit you. She must have changed her mind. Okay. Yes, I'll tell her. Bye. Hi, Nelson. - Hello. How are you? - How are you doing? - Where have you been? - I was at Hélène's. It really is quite simple. Your wife has been renting a small apartment. - I have the address right here. - She's renting an apartment? Yes, in a working-class area... fourth floor, no elevator. Here. She's there every afternoon... for no more than... two and a half hours. Well, she goes every day, except on Sundays. Do you think she has a lover? Well, if we rely on our experience, I admit she may have one. Who is it? That's the only problematic detail. We don't know who it is. Since we started our investigation, about 10 days ago, he hasn't left the apartment. Not once? Not once, Mr. Jones. But... how can anybody stay in an apartment for 10 days... without going out once? He might like to stay at home. Or he might have legitimate reasons for it. Maybe he's hiding from the police, maybe he's seriously ill, or famous. - Right. - We knew a singer, a real icon, who never left his house. You're a diplomat, Mr. Jones. You are aware of the fact that we live in a dangerous world. We're all looking for a place to hide. Can I get a duplicate of the key? Theoretically, that would be illegal. - I will pay accordingly. - Speaking of which, here is our bill. Nothing urgent. All right. - Something you wanted, Camille? - The queen is coming! What, now? No, in three months' time, on an official visit. It's still a secret, but I thought I'd let you know right away. You have to plan the entire cultural program. - Right. Okay. Thanks. - I can help you, if you like. That's very kind. Thank you. Will I see you this weekend? Can't say for sure. How is Margaret? She's very well, thanks. - If I may... - Please. Sir? Not a world about the Queen. You can count on me. Of course, if we manage to shed some light on that mystery... Of course. - What mystery? - Oh, nothing. Margaret? It's me, Peter. Margaret, do you hear me? Open up. Open the door. It's not locked. Sir... I'm this lady's husband. Get up, please. Do not be afraid. Let's not make a big fuss about this. Please get up. I'm not armed. Where are your clothes? Please get dressed and let's talk. Where's he from? Where are you going, Peter? Are you alone? Just the two of you? Why, yes, of course. And the other times, too? Yes. The other times, too. I can't believe it. I simply can't believe it. I think they're waiting for us to leave. It seems completely unreal to me. I thought I knew you well. Then suddenly, this. Peter, can you ask for the check? Just tell me one thing frankly. Is this monkey really your lover? Yes. But it's unthinkable. Margaret, what's happened to you? Have you gone completely insane? I'm tired, Peter. Let's go to bed. I just find out that you're the mistress of a monkey... and you say to me, "Let's go to bed." But I want to understand, Margaret. Will you put yourself in my position for a moment? I want to know everything, right from the very beginning. What, for instance? You sex life, for instance. What do you do with him? I don't question you about your sex life with Camille. - That's not at all the same thing. - Yes it is. Why did you choose a monkey? He chose me as well. Shall we go? Aren't you going to leave anything? How much do you pay a month? - What for? - For the apartment. Oh, not much. 2,000 francs. Still... Why not bring him home? You're not serious. We're not children anymore. We'll have to find a way to handle it. What about Nelson? He'd love it. I'm absolutely serious. We can all live together. It's out of the question. What does he do at night all alone? He sleeps. Margaret, I'm sure that it's possible... What? That we all live here together? Yes. Jealousy is a sickness that no one can control. If you really want to make me jealous, then leave him where he is. One day, I'll take the gun, go and shoot him. Maybe you're right. Maybe we could try. Nelson. How did it go? He's a little frightened. - Max. Max. - Come out now. Slowly. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, I'm not leaving you. His name's Max? Yes. His name's Max. - Who is it? - It's me, Maria. Hello... Calm down, calm down, Maria. Maria. This way. Wait here. I'll open up. Here. You can take him in now. Come on, Max. Go on. Go on, Max. Come out. Max. I'll go in. Go ahead, but be careful. Chimpanzees are really strong. Yes, I know. Come on, Max. Come here. Come here. Don't be afraid. Come. Come to me. Is that a gorilla? No, Maria. It's a chimpanzee. Don't be afraid. Come here. Come to me. There you go, Max. He did it! He went in! Here we go. Good bye, sir. Maria? Do you feel any better? Hi, Dad. - How are you? - I'm fine. And you? I'm okay. Didn't you go to the embassy today? No. - What about Mom? - She's still in the room. With Max? And everything's all right? Wait just a moment. Margaret, it's me. Is everything all right? Yes. Everything's fine, Peter. Don't come in now, please. So, you don't need me? No. No, not at all. You coming out soon? Yes. Yes, in a little while. Leave us alone, would you? Oh! I didn't expect to find you here. What is it? I was coming to see Margaret, to chat a bit. To chat? To... to chat about what? About you. Well, Margaret's not in. Well, may I come in anyway? Actually, I've got company. Who? - The detective? - No. Not the detective. - What was that noise? - It was nothing. Something in the kitchen. Why were you hiring a detective, anyway? What were you trying to find out? Oh, nothing important. - Hello, Nelson. - Hello, Camille. At what time will Margaret be back? I've no idea. I don't know where she is. Here. Give these to your mother. Are you hiding something from me? Of course not. Why? Will I see you one of these days? Of course you will. We'll see each other tomorrow. I will find out what's going on. I promise you, I will. Bye. Why did you say that Mama wasn't in? Nelson. Nelson. Nelson. Nelson, where are you? Here! Nelson! What are you doing there? Come back here right away. I'm watching. I already told you not to go there. Come back now, Nelson! No. I stay where I am. Today we're going to try a little experiment. We'll have breakfast, the three of us. Is it true? You're going to let him in? Yes. Yes, we are. But make sure that all the doors of the living room are closed, right? And if you see him moving around, don't get excited and don't move. I'll go and get him. Max. Max. Max, come here! Come here! Let's go out. Come here. This way. Hi, Max. Max. Max. Come this way. Nelson. Come. Sit down and let's eat. Max, come here. Max. Max. Come sit with us. Good boy. Come on. Max. Look. Max. Eat. Why? What's going on? Who locked the door? Nelson, would you open the door, please? We're attempting a little experiment. Hello, Max. Shake his hand. Max. Max. How are you this morning? He's been with us now for ten days. I thought it was time he joined us. I've read they don't like children at all. Maria, don't be afraid. He is not dangerous. Give me that. Maria, what's on your face? I don't... know. It suddenly appeared. Have you seen a doctor? - No, sir. - You should. It looks like eczema. And her face is all swollen. Come on, now, Nelson. Be quick or you'll be late. I'd gone to the zoo one day with a friend. I don't know why. I noticed him. And he stared at me. He just stared at me for a long time. I gave him something to eat, and I found him very beautiful. The next day, I went back alone, and he recognized me. And he stared at me again for a long time. I spoke to one of the guards who said they'd bought him... from a circus that had gone bankrupt. But he wasn't happy in the zoo. He was lonely. He refused to have contact with the other monkeys. The guard said if I wanted him, I could have him for a good price. That's all there is to it. Kind of love at first sight? You've got a little scratch just here. It's nothing. She could have picked a better day for her birthday party. Don't forget the flowers. Do you want to go home? You're taking a while, Hélène. - Doesn't it fit you? - Yes, it does. Are you coming? The Betchels are here. Tell me, when you say you're coming to see me, who is it you're visiting? Is Archibald back? No. So it's someone new. Do I know him? No. Does Peter know? Excuse me, Hélène. Hello? Yes, Mom. No, I can't talk right now. I have guests. Yes. All right, will you call me back tomorrow? Take care. Bye. - Do you like it? - Very much. Sounds like a collie. What about that one? That's a mutt, I bet. It's probably the beast that attacked me. The collie belongs to our neighbors. You haven't been hunting with us for a while. Indeed... I'm very busy these days. - You're getting ready for the Queen. - I am. But... I think I hear a bulldog. What is that? That... That could be... Maria? Can you get the door? - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. - Are you Maria? - Please come in. What happened to your face? Mr. Archibald is here. Archibald? Good evening. I wanted to be here for your birthday. Thanks, Archibald. That's very kind. When did you get in? Just now. I'm coming from the airport. - Are you coming from Libanon? - Yes. Hello. Hi, Archibald. But, Archie, you're completely soaked. Don't you want to change your clothes? No, I'm fine. At least change your jacket. I'll go and find something for you. - Archibald, have you had dinner yet? - Well... I did, on the plane. If you can call that a dinner. Airplane food used to be much better. - Hello. - Hello. Hi, Archibald. Would you like some dessert? Yes. I'll sit with you, then. Sure. Maria? Please bring a chair and an extra plate. - Yes, ma'am. - Here. Put this on. I was supposed to get in earlier, but with this weather, the flight got delayed. There must have been some serious turbulence. Yes, it was quite something. Here, Archibald. - Please, take these. - Maria? What's happened to you? What's on your face? We don't know what it is. She doesn't like to talk about it. - What's all this screaming? - It's from an animal. What animal? Take a guess. An old poodle? Or a Japanese dog? It's not a wildcat, I hope. No. No. It's only Max. - Who is Max? - It's Max. It's a monkey. A chimpanzee. He got scared by the storm and the dogs, that's all. Shall I bring out some coffee now? You've got a monkey? - Here at home? - Yes. - I'd like to see him. - No, thanks! I'd love to. I'm quite curious. Why are you always contradicting me? I think you should go and get him. - Are you sure? - Yes. Why not? I'm warning you, he's quite big. 10 years ago in Sumatra, we had an orangutan. Do you remember? Don't make any sudden moves and avoid screaming. Just act as if new guest were arriving. Don't be afraid. Here he comes. Max. Max. Max, give it back! Give it to me. Don't move. He'll take it as a threat. Please sit down. Max, Max, listen to me. Calm down, or go back to your room! Calm own. Max, come sit down. - Good evening, Max. - Good evening, Max. Good evening, Max. Don't play with that. Poor guy... always locked up in his room. - How old is he? - We don't know. But he's of adult size. They say that chimpanzees are really close to human beings. They're out cousins, so to speak. Sorry, but I don't feel like we're from the same family. Oh, I almost forgot. - Is he hungry? - Do you think he is? Max. Max. Would you like some food? Max. Max, don't do that. Stop it Is he potty-trained? Does he relieve himself where he is told? He is very clean. This is for you. I found it during a dig. 1,000 BC. Do you like it? Thanks, Archibald. It's beautiful. Max! He's upset. He's not used to being around so many people. That, and the storm. What is he doing? Max, no. He's very attached to Margaret. Indeed. No, Max. - No, Max. - Is he always like this? Max. No. No. I take it it's a male. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it, Max. That's enough. Margaret, I think you better take him back to his room. Otherwise, he might spoil our evening. That dog again. It's getting on my nerves. It's always fascinating to watch monkeys. You think so? It's like catching sight of your own past in a mirror. I'm sure that people come here to watch them have sex. You think so? I'm sure of it. I have a friend who lives all alone with a huge dog. She's divorced. Everyone wonders about it. You mean the dog's her lover? Well, it's not impossible. And what about with a monkey? What about what with a monkey? Do you know of any woman who have sex with monkeys? No. How awful! Why? Do you think it's any harder than with a dog? Oh, yes. Besides, it's so quick: two or three seconds and it's all over. - Really? That fast? - Well, see for yourself. Do you think that you could have sex with a monkey? Well, why do you ask? I'd like to know. You women have so many secrets. You want to watch me have sex with a monkey? No, I didn't say that. Why did you bring me here? Maria? What did the doctor say? He said it's an allergy. An allergy to what? An allergy to monkey hair. - Is he sure of that? - That's what he said. - And so? - So I'm leaving. I've packed my suitcases and I'm ready to leave. - So soon? - Or you can get rid of the monkey. I can't stay another day, ma'am. The doctor said it was serious. I could even lose my hair! I already don't have much of it. Listen, Maria. I can't get rid of Max. Not so suddenly. Can you understand that? Really? Then I'm leaving. Listen, I'm supposed to go out with my husband tonight, but take a week off. I'm sure things will get better. I'm going, but... at least stay tonight. Please. - Archibald? - Hi. Hello. - Were you leaving? - I was just about to. Peter's expecting me at the office. - This is Dr. Mischler. - Nice to meet you. Good afternoon, ma'am. Dr. Mischler is a neuropsychologist. Really? I thought maybe he could help you out. - Help me out? - Yeah. Do you think I need a doctor? I've been gone too long. This is all my fault. What are you talking about? Listen, Dr. Mischler can show a lot of understanding. He's seen very complex and odd cases. And since your husband doesn't seem to be taking care of you, I thought I should. And you think I need a neuropsychologist because you were gone? You're oversimplifying things, Margaret. Margaret, you could at least tell me the truth. - That's the least you can do. - Why is that? Why? Because... Because of our friendship. Or if it's over between us, just tell me. - Then I'm telling you. - What's going on? All right, the digs have taken longer than expected, but you haven't sent me a single letter. - I'm late, Archibald. - Listen. I understand that, out of loneliness, a woman might do something crazy. I promise this is not your fault. I don't understand your reaction. Let alone your husband's. The one thing I can tell you is that you should get help. You seriously need help. A few sessions and a light treatment... I told you not to bring flowers. You were right. The dog seems to have quieted down. They say it's Max's presence that excites him. Oh, he'll get used to it. Maria, are you there? Peter, come quickly. - What's wrong? - Max has disappeared. Who opened the window? Well, don't look at me like that. I wasn't here. Maria, maybe? Or maybe he opened it himself. I can see him. I'll be right back. Max. Max. Max. Come on now, Max. Be a good chap. You can't stay out at this time of the night. Margaret will be worried. Please, Max. Do it for her. Max. Sorry, we haven't heard anything about a chimpanzee... either here in Paris or in the suburbs. But... it's a big animal. If he really got lost, we'll find him Where can a monkey go when he's feeling lonely? It's already a puzzling question... when it comes to humans, so... - Excuse me. - Thank you. Maybe he found someone else. No. Good afternoon, ma'am. Good afternoon, Maria. You look better. Yes, everything disappeared in just three days. I was wondering if I could come back. Do you know that Max escaped? Yes, the concierge told me. That's why I'm here. Maria... did you open the window? No, sir. Let's go, Maria. Bye, Nelson. - Bye, darling. - Bye. It was all just a dream. Some kind of utopia. I think the best thing to do is just to forget all about it and try to get back to some kind of normal, ordinary life. I know it's hard. If you need anything, I'm always here. I got quite used to him. He was beginning to be fond of you. Would you like anything else, ma'am? No, thanks, Maria. He's back! Max! Max. Max, Max. Max. Where have you been? You look thinner. You're shaking. You must have been so cold. Here. You never loved me like that. For the afternoon, we have proposed a visit to the Centre Georges Pompidou at Beaubourg. But Her Majesty prefers the stud farm at Compiègne. You Excellency, ladies and gentlemen, that's all for now. Thank you all very much. Are you all right? You see more and more tired lately, remote. Sometimes I feel like getting away. Come to my place. You can hide out there. No one will disturb you. Yes. Perhaps I will. Come tonight. I'll have a surprise for you. - All right? - Okay. - Ah, finally! - Sorry I'm late. - Can I come in? - Of course. Come in. - Have you eaten? - No, no. But I'm not hungry, thanks. Well, shall I heat up something? No. I don't want anything, honestly. Thanks. Here. Have you been drinking? Yes. A bit. Peter, this is my friend Roger. - He's a zoologist. - Is that right? THE ENRAGED BEAST He's written a wonderful book about wolves. And he's spent two years in the middle of the African forest. - Right? - Two and a half years. I assume you have questions to ask him. I do? What questions? Well, I have one. Tell me, Roger, have there been any love stories... between women and animals? - Yes, that's very possible. - For instance? We see that with dogs. It's even quite frequent. The Japanese used to tell... a beautiful love story... between a horse and a young girl. A horse? How about with wild animals? It's not frequent. In Canada, during the war, a bear made love with two women. O la la! How about monkeys? Are you asking about real accounts... between monkeys and women? Yes. We don't know very many. Half-naked women kidnapped by gorillas... that's European fiction. But is a love affair possible? Like the one that you described between the young girl and the horse? Could you conceive of such a thing... with a monkey? I'm not talking about sex... or even the affection you can feel for a dog. I'm talking about love. Is love possible... only between members of the same species? Or could a horse fall in love with a snake... or with a cherry tree? Not as far as I know. But if it did happen, especially with a woman, it would make a terrific book. Do you know... a relationship of that kind, with a monkey, perhaps? No, nothing specific. That would be quite an event. Microphones could be installed... in this woman's bedroom. Even a camera... with her permission, of course. It's a guaranteed best-seller. Could a woman have a child with a monkey? No. Absolutely not. I know for sure. Well, Roger, thank you so much. That was most interesting. It's getting late. I must go. I'll see you soon. Thanks again for the wonderful dinner. - Good evening, Mr. Jones. - Good evening. No. No! Stop it! Why didn't you tell me the truth? You still don't want to talk about what you do in private. Oh, Peter, for heaven's sake. Are you really satisfied with the way things are? Perhaps. What would you say... if I were to ask you to choose between him and me? I love you both. Well, what... if I were to force you to choose? You can't force me. You know that. What are you thinking about? I'm thinking about you. As you said, you could kill Max very easily. Kill Max? No one would blame you. No one would accuse you: first of all because he's my lover, but also because he's an animal. This is the key to Max's room. I'll leave it in here. I know you won't kill Max just to hurt me. If you do want to kill him, you can. No risk for you. Look, my stocking's running. I have to go home and change. Want to help me? No, thanks, Miss. But maybe you'd like to come to my place? Why not? It'll be 600 francs. Come this way. I've always dreamed of having a place like this. I love that style. Where's the bedroom? Hold on. Tell me, what's your name? - Françoise. - Françoise. Françoise, what I am about to ask you... will seem strange. Really? You don't seem strange. No, it's not for me. Come with me. Oh, the key. Wait for me here. - I do apologize. - No harm done. This is... Max. Hi, Max. You want me to have sex with him? Yes... I'd like that. Would you be watching? Yes. Do you like to watch? I don't know. I've never done that before. That's why I'd like to do it. I want to see what happens. - Is that a gorilla? - No, it's a chimpanzee. And chimpanzees can have sex with women? They can. All right... then it'll cost you double. Okay, fine. Max. Gentle, Max. I've brought you a little present. What am I supposed to do exactly? I don't know. Take your clothes off... and get on the bed. - It'll only last a few seconds. - For real? That's what I heard. Has he had sex with a woman before? Yes he has. - Several times? - Many times. Is he nice? He's not going to bite me, right? He's very sweet. And he looks very happy. How can you tell? I know him well. Do I keep my stockings on? What do you think? They're done for anyways. Hello, Max. See? I'm naked, just like you. Hold on, Françoise. Here, take this. Does he speak French or English? He's bilingual. See, everything here's for you. I've never had to use an apple to seduce somebody before. Yes. That's good. Can I take a bite too? I'm afraid I'm not his type. You're right. I'm sorry. Bye, Max. No hard feelings. Who was that woman? - Camille? - No. That was a whore. I got her for Max, not for myself. What happened? Would you be hurt if Max made love with another woman? - Did he? - Yes. I don't believe you. No, you're right. He didn't. - What is it, Peter? - I need to know. I need to be sure. Do you know what I'd like? Do you know what would relieve me? To watch you... the two of you, when you make love. Never. I'd like to make love with you tonight. If you like. How do you feel? Fine. Was it good? Yes. Was it as good as with him? Peter... don't But I need to know. Can't you understand? I need to know. Otherwise, I shall go insane. I can't think about anything else. Where are you going? I'm going to the end room. - I'm coming with you. - No. Why do you insist on watching us? To be sure. Because I can't believe that you really do it. Why? Why don't you believe me? You just say that to hurt me, make me feel jealous, but it's not true. In reality, that monkey's incapable of making love with a woman. It's just like a cat or a little dog. You just pet each other, that's all. I swear to you that you're wrong. Then let me watch. Just once. Please. You can look through the keyhole, if that's what turns you on. We were wrong. You understand? Completely wrong. We thought that we could act more freely, more tolerantly, more intelligently, but it's nonsense. We've just been stupid, that's all. Everyone's laughing at me. And everyone thinks that you are nuts. I mean completely nuts. Not to mention the money. Do you realize how much this simian love affair of yours has cost me? There's the rent on a two-roomed apartment, the gate, the transport, the detective, the vet, the food. It's a fortune. It's more than the most expensive mistress. So listen to me very carefully. I want that monkey to get the hell out of here. Is that clear? If he goes... I go, too. All right. All right. You can go anywhere you want with your precious Max, but listen to me carefully, because I want to make something perfectly clear. Tonight, when I come home from the office, I don't want to see his face here anymore. You understand? I do not want to see his face here anymore. Hello? Oh, it's you, Mum. Don't apologize. Sure... Sure... sure I'm fine. What about you? I request four tickets for the other four. And I've given two! Where are the tickets going? - There must be a black market... - Quiet, please! It's always the same thing. I'm sure they sell them. In any case, it will be a most tedious evening, and you would all be better off in front of your TV sets. So I suggest that you go home... if you want to see the queen and her monkey. Monkey? What are you talking about? What? What do you mean? Please go. I repeat, there's not a single seat available. The office is closed. Thank you. Do you have a second? Roger has something he wants to tell you about. - Yes, what is it? - Camille... told me everything about your wife. I sympathize with you. What a shock. Of course, I won't tell anyone, but I thought maybe I could help you. I'm indeed interested in that monkey. I could take care of him if he's become a burden to you. I could take him to an institute where he'd be taken care of. He'd be well-treated and living amongst other monkeys. All I would do is study him. Naturally, it'd be helpful... if your wife could visit him once in a while... and offer her cooperation. What do you mean? If we want to conduct a full experiment... and study all aspects of that monkey's behavior, I suggest that your wife... Get out of here, you bastard! - No, Peter, you've got it all wrong! - Get out! Out! Get out! It's a monkey. Margaret? Nelson? Anyone in? What are you doing in here? Margaret. How long are you planning to stay here? You intend to spend the rest of your lives in this room? Nelson. You really planning on staying here forever? Never to leave? Not to see your friends? Not to watch television? What about school tomorrow? Margaret. Open this gate! Your dinner's ready in the kitchen. You just have to heat it up. Do yo remember what I said to you this morning. Yes. But we intend to stay here, Nelson and I, until you've changed your mind. Okay. Enough's enough. Max. All right, Max. Peter! Have you gone mad? I told you I want that god-darn ape to get the hell out of here. And since you don't want him to leave, I'm going to shoot. No. Max! No, Peter. Max! Dad, don't kill him! Get away, Nelson. Max. - Max! - Max! Max, stay here! He's going to kill you! Don't kill him, Dad! Get away from him! Move away! Max, hide. Peter, don't Stay where you are. Don't come near. Max, no! Max, no! Max! Max, let go of the gun! Let go. Come on. Max. - Max, come to me. - Margaret. Margaret, get the gun away from him. Max! Max, give me that. Max, give me the gun. Max. Don't touch that! Max. Max, what are you doing? Max, stop playing. Give me that. Come on, give it to me. Nelson, get down! Margaret, the key, quick. Quick! Throw it! Peter, watch out! Max, no! Margaret, the key, quick! Max. Max. Max. Okay, Max. That's enough. Max! Max, give me the gun. Max, give me the gun. There's one shot left. Get out! Quick! Police! Open the door! Max, that's enough. Give me the gun. - Mr. Jones? - Yes. Someone called for you. Why didn't you say you were a member of the Diplomatic Corps? This way, please. No. I'd rather stay here. Thank you. But why? Because I deserve it. Are you all right? I'm okay. Hello, sir. Sir. Archibald sent me Dr. Mischler. He's a neurologist. I'm sorry. Would you like some coffee? No, no thanks. How's Max? He was very frightened. He trembled all night. Has Nelson gone to school? Yes. I really wanted to kill him, you know. I really wanted to kill him. I noticed. But it's over now. My head's clear. I promise. Are you sure? I'll never do it again. I swear. Take the gun. You can throw it away if you like. No. I'd like to see Max. May I? So... what do you think of all this? Me? Nothing, really. Sorry, but I'm late. I... - Are you leaving? - Yes. Very good idea. Peter, I'm afraid I have to leave. Why? - It's my mother. She fell. - Again? Yes, but this time she's in the hospital. Well, leave Max with me. I'll look after him. Don't be afraid. I think it would be better if I took him along with me. To the hospital? You can't be serious. Can I trust you? She's asleep now. No. There's no fracture of the skull. It was just the shock of the impact. Two, three days. Maybe four. How are things going over there? How's Max? He's fine. Yes, everything's all right. Well, actually, he's in the middle of eating. Don't worry. Call me tomorrow. Here's a kiss for you. Bye. He didn't eat anything. Max, look. Fruits of your own country. Eat. Max. Max. Max, why won't you speak to me? Just once. You still angry with me? Do you know, Max, this is the first time that you and I have been alone together, just the two of us. What can I do? Can't you tell me? What can I do for you? Yes, fine. No, he's eaten. Slept. Yes, everything's fine. He seems really happy. Oh, yes. Today's the big day. She arrives at noon at the airport. Of course I'm going. What about your mother? How's she? She's feeling much better today. She's very well taken care of here. She sends her love. Yes, I'll tell her. I'll call you tonight. Bye. He's going to pick up the Queen. - Is that him? - Yes. Nelson. Why did you bring him in here? You couldn't do anything for him, so... - He's not dangerous? - Of course not. See for yourself. Don't ever forget... that an animal remains an animal. I'll perk him up a little with some vitamins. But he needs to see some trees, a river, some birds, a forest. The countryside would be perfect for him. And for you too. Hey, Mrs. Jones! Telephone for you! Hello. Yes, it's me. What? - Well, what's the matter with him? - Well... well, to tell you the truth, Margaret, he hasn't eaten since you left. No, he's not sick. He just won't eat. No, we tried everything. Really. He won't touch a thing. Let me talk to him. All right. One second. Hold on. Nelson, help me. We'll have to sit him up. I'm going to give him the phone. Speak to him. Max. What's she saying? She's singing. Nelson. Oh, hello, Nelson. He's sick. Do you realize you are to go to the opera tonight? The opera? Do you know what time it is? Well, it doesn't matter. I'm not going. What? Max is sick. I can't go to the opera. Are you out of your mind? The queen is there! Margaret, hello. It's me again. Tell me something, Peter. Isn't tonight the night of the opera? Nelson. Nelson. Nelson, quick. Hurry up and get ready. We're leaving. - Now? - Right now. Where to? We're going to see your grandmother. With Max? Yes, of course we're taking Max. We're going for him. Steady, Max. You'll soon see her. This is a mistake, sir. We don't take care of animals here. He's not here for health reasons. I'd like to see my wife. She's with her mother, Mrs. Ravel. - Room 122. - Thank you. But you may not go with an animal. He's perfectly domesticated. He's very sweet. I'll answer for him. No, we have strict rules. I'll call your wife. What's her name? - Mrs. Jones. - Wait right here. Mrs. Jones? Your husband is here to see you. Yes, in the lobby. No, he can't come up. All right. She's coming. May I sit down? He's a little heavy. You can sit over there. Make sure he doesn't touch anything. Easy, Max. Margaret's coming. Here we go. Easy, easy. Max. That's it. Okay. There, Max. Max. Max. Max. I'm here now, Max. Max. I'll never forget what you've done. What about your work? They're doing fine without me. This has been an unexpected vacation. It's marvelous. It's been good. Shall we let him out? Why not? Come out, Max. Let's take a stroll. Come. Don't be scared. He's beautiful! Yes. He feels at home. Animals are more beautiful when they're free. Max! Max! Max, where are you going? Max, come back! Max! Max! Max! Margaret, you okay? - Yes. - You're sure? You're not hurt? - Where is he? - Max! - Where is he? - Max! Max! Max! Why did you do that? Why? He's never been free. Ever. He doesn't know what it's like. Margaret. Margaret. Listen. I'm here. And I will help you. Margaret. Margaret. Do you think Mother knows? Knows about what? The truth about Max and me. And that's why she let him run away. Who does know the truth apart from you? Thanks for coming. It really helped my recovery. I'm sorry about the monkey. - If he ever comes back... - I'll call you right away. - Bye. - Bye, Mum. - Bye. - Bye, Grandma. Bye. - Good bye. - Good bye, Peter. Thanks again. What are you thinking about? I was thinking about Max. That he's perhaps dead. Do be quiet. Dad? Why do people hunt? What's the matter with them? What are they trying to say? Max! Max? What about him! It's Max. He's on the roof. On the roof of the car? - Peter, stop. - I can't stop. We're on a motorway. - But, Dad, at least slow down. - Are you sure he won't fall of? No, of course not. He will be fine where he is. Hi, Max! How are you? Do you recognize me? Max! - Do you know her? - Yes. Max knows her, too. But she wasn't his type. - Oh, Maria. - Good evening, ma'am. Sir. Good evening, sir. See? I'm completely cured. Will you hire me back? Aren't you allergic to monkey hair? No, the doctor said it wasn't Max's fault at all. In fact... I'm allergic to you. Sorry, sir, but when you're nervous and in a bad mood, it has direct consequences on my skin. Look, I can touch him. I can even kiss him. I'm no longer scared. What tells you I'll always be in a good mood? Hello. May I say who's calling? Mademoiselle Camille. I'm afraid he's not home right now. Yes, I think he'll be at the office. I will let him know. Bye. Some more? I think he's had enough. - Nelson, aren't you late? - Yes, Dad. What are you thinking? I was imagining I heard the bell ringing. I opened the door, and it was the police. They'd come for Max. They'd had complaints from the neighbors... and they wanted to lock him up. They said, "You have no right to keep him." "He's too old." "He's too dangerous." "He's already escaped once before." And what did you do? I tried holding on to him. I pleaded with them. But it was no use. So I took the gun... and I killed him.
