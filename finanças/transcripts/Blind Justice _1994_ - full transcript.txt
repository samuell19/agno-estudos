Where you going? I asked you a question, cabron! Much obliged. Could you tell me how to get to Los Portales? Howdy, Luis! Where are the others? Gone. Not Hector. - They're all dead. - He's a liar! Who has done this thing? Gringo. A blind one. He could not see, but he could shoot, I swear! He had a baby with him. Yes! This blind one who shot Hector. The one with the baby. How come he didn't kill you? Didn'tI tell you to guard the road, Luis? I have a feeling that maybe you got tired of waiting. I, too, am tired of waiting. - That's right! - Same here. Roberto, take Coyote and Vato, ride to San Pedro, find Hector. Papa, I think we should wait. They'll come back soon. Kid's right. We got them blue bellies holed up like a bunch of ticks. That silver ain't going nowhere. They have to give it up. Find your brother. Water. Help me. Water! Give him some water. Can't you see the man is thirsty? Water. Looks like the man needs a chaser. What do you think? No. Maybe he needs something to eat. No! Don't want your soul here. Get out of here! Go on! Just get out and stay out. Go on! - Good day. - For some of us. - You heard of Los Portales? - This is San Pedro. How did you get into town? On the road. On a horse. You're blind. You know, Father, I don't much like the idea of drawing on a man of God. But I will if you don't drop that gun, Mr. Holy Man. Slow. How do you know I'm a priest? I hear them praying for you. Sarge! - Sarge! - What? How the hell did he get into town when we can't get out? How the hell do you think he gotinto town? Who ya got posted out there? Stiggs and Beecham. Stiggs and Beecham? That's how. Damn. What's that noise? Noise? Indians say it's the gods doing a war dance. How about that? Sounds to me like the gods got themselves some dynamite. - What can I do for you? - Just get whiskey. And a little milk... for this baby here. No milk! Well now, do you want a whiskey? No whiskey either. - You got cigars? - Sorry. What kind of town you got here? You got preachers who packiron. A man can't get himself a drink, a little bit of smoke. I got some mescal, private stock. That's gonna do. I'm looking for a town called Los Portales. Can't help. Hector. Shit. - These dead men belong to you? - They just came with those horses. You're a funny man. What's your name? You the law? Closest thing they got to it in this shit hole. You're cavalry? Hastings, Sergeant, U.S. Army. The world is full of them. - What's that? - Assholes. How did you get here? I had sentries posted outside the canyon. You should watch your hand. I'm looking for a town called Los Portales. You ever heard of that? Can't say I have. Then I'll just leave these boys with you. - Be on my way... - You're not going any... - Wilcox! - That's enough! Wilcox! I said, "That's enough!‚Äù You're looking for Los Portales? I can take you there if you help us. Hell, how do you know he's not one of them? See for yourself, Sergeant! Do you have any idea who those men are? Those men you killed? I can't say I do. Didn't really get a good look at them. That'll be four bits. - There are three out there. - You got 45 cents? About three weeks ago, Alacran's gang chased Hastings and his men up here. There's only one road out of the canyon and they've cut it off. There's no food, there's no medicine. There's no whiskey and there's no milk. - So what's he after? - Silver. Apparently the soldiers were headed for the mint. - Mister? - Canaan. - Do you mind if I ask you a question? - I been near blind since the war. You've adapted quite well. That was an impressive performance out there. Why thank you, Doctor. You don't much like doctors, do you? The world's kind of full of them. I'm not a doctor, Mr. Canaan. I was trained as an army nurse. I grew tired of dressing wounds and putting men back together. This was a peaceful town before this business and I want peace again. Do you understand? Is this your baby? She just belongs to a woman in Los Portales. I promised a man I'd take her there. I've just been having one hell of a time. - It's a very small town. - Must be. You got kin there? A brother. - What's her name? - Nothing. Just "baby." Poor man died just before he could tell me. That's too bad. It was a shame I had to kill him. They got Stiggs! Man your posts! Close up that window! Damn it, men! Look lively! - He got Stiggs! - Son of a bitch! - Damn, he got Beecham. - I see that. You get yourself a clean chance at the one with the shotgun, you take it. - What the hell you want? - You know what we want. In there. Forget it. Tell Alacran that's property of the U.S. government. You tell Alacran we got a full company of cavalry on their way. - 100 guns, at least! - 100 guns, at least? Good, who's bringing them? Let's see. It's Moody? Walker? I don't think him. Gent? O'Riley, Pierce. This is a long list, Sergeant. You want I should read them all? Okay. Bennet, Calhoun... You shut your mouth, boy! They all hang from trees! Alacran, he nails them up for the ants, crows and coyotes. Itis time to stop playing games. Haven't these people suffered enough for you and your government? Aren't they hungry? Nothing comes in. Shit. The road is Alacran's. The road to San Pedro is the road to hell. Roberto! Get ready. My order, boys. Hector? Who did this? He died so you will die! Give him up! We start killing you one by one. This is your last chance. You called me out? Drop 'em or I kill him. Wait! Hold your fire! He's got one of my men! Drop them. Drop them. Please God, I won't chase whores, I'll quit gambling. I'll quit drinking whiskey, I swear! I'll be good, I swear I will... Fire! Got you, you son of a bitch! Shit. Get him inside. Hurry up! Move it! Get back in line! I said, "Get back in line!" I see we're awake! Where the hell are my glasses? - Put them on... - Just get the glasses! Where's that baby? Lucille, she's fine. She's asleep in my office. What do you call her? Lucille. Thought she should have a name. A child deserves a name. I don't like it. It sounds like a whore's name. - What do you suggest? - I suggest you mind your own... Christ! What's the matter, afraid you may grow attached? - I'm not afraid of a goddamn thing. - No, I don't suppose you are. If I want to name her, I will. I won't name her something as stupid as Lucille. She's my... She's your what? My responsibility. She's not a responsibility, she's a baby! She needs love. You can't love something that doesn't have the simple dignity of a name! If you can't manage that, leave her with me and I'll find someone who can. Have you ever been abandoned? When do we leave? - What? - For Los Portales. - When do we leave? - You said you'd help us. I thought I did. Evening, ma'am. Johnson, get the window. Franklin, the door. I don't like this. You! I said alone. These are my men. Dismissed! - Stand guard outside. - Yes, sir. You got a problem with my boys? One took a shot at me yesterday, that's a real problem. - Impossible. - You had a rifle in the bell tower. - All my men were accounted for. - Please. Sit down. Drink? Where the hell"d you get that? That's private stock. How'd that piece of shit, Alacran, get the drop on a bunch of seasoned veterans? You go to hell. How much silver you gotin your wagon? One ton. And what are you warriors willing to part with? - What? - If I ride out and get you the help you need. I told you he couldn't be trusted. He has a point, Sergeant. I believe some reward would be in order. Thank you. His reward, ma'am, would be in the honor of serving the interests of his country. - You find that funny? - My country? Your country, the United States of America! I Son, my country begins and ends right here. Your country's going to have to cough up 10 percent just to buy me and my services. Ten percent, 200 pounds of silver, you understand? And throw in a box of those cigars. I stole this one off a dead man and I'm getting sick of it. Forget about that. I have men that will go out... You got men and they're dead! You got your whole goddamn regiment out there right now rotting on trees! You got dead men! Now, you can take it... or you can leave it. A blind man. And how did you know this man is blind? He had a stick to find his way? No. - A tin cup, perhaps, to beg for the coins? - He did not have a tin cup. He was wearing dark glasses. Because a man wears dark glasses, this tells you he's blind. You are a bigger fool than Luis. One man kills five of my best men. He killed my son. I taught him how to shoot. I taught him how to ride. With these eyes, I saw him kill 23 men. And now, you want me to believe he was murdered by a man who is blind? The whole world is turning to shit. We will go into San Pedro, and take the silver by force. We lost six fellows the last time we tried. I reckon the church is fortified. That's right, if we just... A man does not wait for what he wants. He takes it. Samuel, write to Chonto, get Mackie's gang. Together, we can take San Pedro. Together, we can take San Pedro. Yes, sir. Bull. Go to San Pedro now. Find this ciego and kill him. I will kill the blind man! Be sure to gouge out his eyes and bring them to me. We are going to see who is blind. It's just too much. That's it. 200 pounds. Did you forget something? Yeah. They say these are rolled on the thighs of a Cuban virgin. - I believe them. - I find it highly unlikely. Hell, a man's got to dream. - Take that to my room... - That's not the deal. It stays here until you bring reinforcements. Fine. But not here. Canaan! What do I tell them when I'm short? You can say it fell off the wagon while you boys were out there running yellow. Son of a bitch. That's enough! How dare you defile the house of God! I told you to get... Boom. Boom. This is not your concern. What's the matter, Father? You can't handle the competition? Would you mind putting that out? It's a gift from the United States government. - It's a filthy habit. - I know. I don't want to insult these brave, fighting men in blue. Who did you fight for? God. Jesus! - Did that hurt? - God. Hold still. Breathe in. - Breathe in. - Easy! Easy. That baby's a little old for nursing, isn't she? Maybe you could bring us a cow along with the cavalry? I'm just saying you're spoiling her. Maybe her ma doesn't want her on a tit she don't know about. I'll take that under consideration. You should lie down. You need at least a day's rest before you leave. I'm leaving tonight. That's not advisable. Are these doctor's orders? Yes, they're doctor's orders. I'll tell you what. I'll take that under consideration. What's your name? Fowler, Ernie Fowler. You can call me Ernie, everybody else does. Does this place look as bad as it smells? Hell, no! It's all red satin and gold tassels. - Pretty as a San Francisco whorehouse. - Crystal chandeliers? Hell, yes! Got me a solid marble bar right there to belly up to. That there, it's Italian marble. Hell, you're just full of shit. I'm just twisting your balls. But then... you can't see it. Place might as well look good, right? You're a wise man. No. I'm a bartender. You still riding out tonight? That's the plan. - You don't mind my saying... - Spit it out. You look ragged 'round the edges. Really? I think I look fine. Ernie. Today, I think I look like a goddamn knight in shining armor. Mr. Canaan. Take my bottle. That's right generous of you. That's right generous of you. Damn fool, needs it a lot more than I do. I heard that! Canaan! Are you crazy, trying to kill me? What the hell are you doing here? What does it matter to you? - How'd you getin here? - The door was open. Get off me, bitch! I'm gonna cut you! That gun's empty. That gun's empty. This gun is full. Now she's empty. Bang. You're late. Where is Bull? Dead. I performed the sacrament an hour ago. Bull was my best man. What else did you have to tell me? The soldiers made a bargain with a blind man. He leaves tonight for reinforcements. We will be waiting for this blind man. Alacran! The soldiers make a mockery of my church. They spit on the floor. They swear in front of the altar. Alacran. Soon, Padre. You must have faith. Get back in line! I said, "Get back in line!" Mama! No! What time is it? It's past 8:00. Is it day or night? It's night. Where are my glasses? I have them here. Hold still. You better get that kid some milk. Don't go. And have these sons of bitches keep taking me a piece at a time? I don't think so. Besides, we got a deal. I don't have a brother. I don't have a brother. What? I don't know where Los Portales is. I lied. It must be a small town. You'll stay then? I'm past that now. - Here you go, Sarge! - Good. We passed the surveying party about 30 miles due west. They got a cavalry escort with them. It's enough men to pull us out of here. You just give them this. You say all your men were accounted for during that shootout? Yeah, so? Nobody up in that bell tower? That's right. - What about that priest? - Priest? Will he know I'm leaving tonight? Shit, everybody knows. I wager they do. You gonna wish me luck? Why don't you just go to hell. That'll do. Quit standing around, damn it! Get back to work. Here he comes. Now! Burn in hell, blind man! Halt. I said, "Halt!" Prisoner coming through. Watch yourself. - What is your name, sir? - Canaan. Are you aware of this letter's contents? - He's blind, sir. - That's painfully obvious, Private. Well? I'm asking you a direct question, citizen! I am only to speak to the officer in command. I am. Bully for you. It says here, and I quote, "This man who brung... "The man who brought this letter did so only when we gave him 200 pounds silver.‚Äù Is this true? Am I to assume that you attempted to extort 200 pounds of silver... We only got a 30-mile ride, we best be on our way. I don't believe we will be requiring your assistance, citizen. No? This citizen rode in Antino... and what this citizen has forgotten about is more than you'll ever know. Chain him up! Stand still! If any harm comes to the people of that town, I'm gonna hunt you down. I'm gonna kill every breathing thing you ever loved. Is that clear? Soldier? Take him away! Alacran wants to talk to you. I should kill you for letting him get past you. But I have a feeling... I'm going to need all my men. Even a piece of shit like you. - Cut off his ear. - Left one. Connor! Not here! - Where are the rest of the men? - On their way. Good. The cavalry is on its way. Oh, dear! You boys must be bored out here. They'll be hanging you when they get back. That should perk things up. What the hell are you doing? Catching flies. You caught that? Do it again. What in the hell? You're blind! Well now... that's painfully obvious. Private. Goddamned animals! No sign of life out there. About a dozen more of these fellows. They must've known we were coming, probably halfway to Mexico by now. Cowards! They've turned tail, men! Let's give Hastings a taste of victory! Forward, march! Company, charge! Staring ain't gonna make them come any sooner. What? What, reinforcements, that's what. Hell, if reinforcements was coming they'd already be here. That's not what Sarge says. Sarge! He's the worst of the lot. You better watch your mouth! I've been doing this for 20 years. I rode with Sherman. He was a bastard, but at least he knew when to retreat. We got orders. Orders? Orders? Orders used to be a man fighting for his land or saving another life... or some grand notion. I never thought it'd come down to this! Wagon full of metal don't make no sense to me. That's enough! We could give it to 'em, or they'll kill us for it. That's 'cause you're a coward. Coward. Better to be a coward than to be a fool. Stand down. Stand down! Everybody stand down! What the hell is going on here? - Ain't nothing going on here. - Nothing, sir. Right. I will not tolerate fighting in the ranks. We have a common enemy and we have our orders. - Orders. - That's right. We're to guard this shipment and guarantee its passage with our lives. Am I understood? Am I understood? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Good. Listen! Shut up! What do you make of it, Sarge? No. Watch the road. Easy, boy. What happened? Too many... too many should... Excuse me, soldiers. Lie still. - Last chance... - It's going to be all right. - Hold still. - No chance... Step away. He needs help. He needs a priest. This man is dying! This man is dead. Look at him. He's in the Lord's hands, woman. Now step away from him. You men, pray for this man's soul. What do you think, Sarge? It's a trick. That's Rafferty from the 5th. He's a good man. I trained with him. If it is Rafferty, he's gone brigand. No such thing as a good soldier that deserts his company. No, sir, he's an honest... You men, look sharp! Cavalry'll be here any minute. Quit your jabbering and get this corpse away from my post. I said, "Quit your jabbering!" God damn you! God damn you to hell! Get him out of here. You killed my son. That's what they say. And what do you say? From your lips, I want to hear it. I say, there were three and they all needed killing, and he was just one of them. Go! Tell me something, blind one. Can you smell fear? Sour milk. My son, Hector... did he smell of this sour milk? No. But I smell it on you when you ask. But I smell it on you when you ask. It's a pity you have no family. Because then I could take from you what you have taken from me. But you are like a dog or a snake. All you have is the blood in your veins. And that I'm going to take from you. Drop by drop. While you are dying... think of the people of San Pedro. The ones who sheltered you. For this, they are going to suffer. Let's go! We have work, muchachos. What are we gonna do? Sergeant? Follow orders. Guard the shipment. We only got six men. We wait for reinforcements. Sergeant, there are no reinforcements. Everybody knows they're dead! I don't know that. But supposing they are, soldier. What is it exactly that you suggest we do? I say, we surrender and hand it over. Any more suggestions? Good. Man your posts. Where the hell is that lime? Are you just going to stand there, or are you going to help me? We surrender! For God, for country, for me, myself and I. Alacran! You promised to drive the heretics from my church. First, I will eat the breakfast... drink some mescal, then we will kill all the soldiers. After that, we will all go to the church... and celebrate the mass. I have waited long enough! I want them gone from my town now. Papal Your town? San Pedro belongs to me. Now, out of respect for God, I will spare the church... but the town is going to burn. You're worse than the soldiers. That is true. But at least we are good Catholics. Now, fly away little blackbird. Leave my men to the celebration. Dynamite? Medicine. Medicine. Dynamite! Boom. Boom! Everything's ready. That nurse they got there, she's a fine piece of flesh. Good. You can bring her to me after the funeral. I will give her some medicine. Roberto. Get Remick, round up all the peones. Lock them in the cantina. I want you to guard them until after I bury Hector. But I will miss the funeral! You have not proven yourself worthy to pray for the soul of Hector. I could have killed the blind man! Who buried my brother? I'm not gonna ask again. Where is Hector? Buried up on the hill. Dig him up. Alacran wants to give my brother a proper burial. He's been in the ground for three days. What? Shut up, and just do it! I'll dig him up. Do you want the silver? Should I take it for Hector? Sergeant! Itis time to give it up. You come on and take it! Do not force us to spill the blood of the innocent! - Come out now and we will let you go. - You go to hell! You are a very stupid man. But your men are stupid as well! My men are soldiers in the United States cavalry. They are prepared to die for their country! With all due respect, sir. You're out of your fucking mind. Don't shoot! Wait! He's dead. We're coming out. We're coming out. Is that grave for me? I'm digging up Hector for Alacran to bury again. - He's crazy! - No. He's just upset. Now, me... I'm crazy. Remick. Stand guard. You'll come with me? Come on. - Put down the baby. - It's okay. Put down the baby. Some nurse? You are very beautiful. My father says he's going to fuck you... after we bury my brother Hector. I think it is better that I fuck you now. Next time, I cut the baby. Okay? Okay. Nothing funny. Come on. Come on. Let go of that knife. Let go of that knife. How do you like your eggs, son? Scrambled? Alacran wanted an open casket. No, Father. Puffy. Will you say the mass? Who else would say mass? You shouldn't say the mass today, Father. Not today. - Don't be a fool! - Come to my shed, we'll talk about it. - After the funeral. - No! Please. After the funeral! - He won't come! - Who? Father Malone. We'll light a candle for him. Looks damn respectful, boss. Show some respect. - Have all the preparations been made? - Yes, sir. - Bring the silver that belongs to Hector. - I've got it right here. I want it to go in the coffin. What is it now? He's pulling up the wire. - They're gonna kill us! - Damn it, man. - Pick that up. - Sorry. Pick it up. I said I wanted this casket open. You devil! God damn you! Boom! No! The casket! Shit! Get that casket out of my church! Get out! Take that casket! They're trying to blow us up! Jesus Christ! No! Blind one! Can you hear me? I cannot hear you. But I can see you. The both of you. You are deaf now. As well as blind. No eyes, no ears. You are like a worm. This is for my men. And this is for Hector. I can't see you. And I can't hear you. You smell like shit. Take a bath, asshole. Find anything? Plenty more of that silver laid out over half the town. You use it to build a new church. No priest? Hell, the world is full of them. Here she is! Here you go. You sure you don't have a brother in Los Portales? I wish I knew where it was. I've asked everyone, nobody does. - You sure you're gonna be all right? - I'm gonna be fine. - No more ringing in the ears? - What? No. No more ringing. Maybe he lied. That man you killed. Maybe Los Portales doesn't even exist. Maybe. But I made a promise. I know. What do you think of Nell? Nell? For this little baby here. Just for now. Nell was my mother's name. I think that would be fine.
