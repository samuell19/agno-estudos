Get ready for the killer shot. Kaboom! Gopi. Gopi? What are you doing? It's a Line of Control. Imagine there are chairs on the left and right! Cross at your peril! -Sir... -From top to bottom... She needs to know what's going on here. I'm coming in! Raju? What are you doing? I'm not allowed to talk to the enemy. What? I hope you're keeping your cool In fact, happy Sunday if you're relaxing at home -My auto rickshaw is fine! -That's great! -It is your mistake. -Who's going to pay for my damage? He hasn't left the film, silly! -This is a new scooter. -It's just a minor scratch. Replacing me means How will I travel to my workplace now? If that witch finds out I'm helping you I won't just be banned from the sets I will lose my job, Gopi! Why should I give you 300 rupees? Who the hell are you to teach me? -Shh. -But your job... -If you're done, let's go. -What do you mean? -Madam said, "left, left, left." -And you obeyed her. So this is your fault. You want to fight with me now? It's no joke. There's oil leaking. -Hey! You... Show some respect! -Hey! -How about you do? -What are you doing, man? What are you doing? -Return her helmet. -Who are you? Don't touch me. Don't touch me. I told you to go! Oh, my God! -Rascal! -Sir... You again! Hey... -Stop! -Hey, stop! -Her cell phone! -Stop! He took her cell phone. Hey, stop! -Stop! -You will be cursed for life! -Why did you interfere? -Everyone was simply standing there. Hey, madam! Madam, wait! That person is about to get a chance to meet Yes, you guessed it. I'm talking about our Lucky Lunchtime winner who'll be in the studio soon. Take a message, it's urgent. Tell her it's about Karan Kapoor. Not that number, the one I'm calling from. Hello? My lift! Hey. Bring sweetmeats for the boys. Yes, sir. Boss, what do I do? Criminals work on Sundays too. We need the station opened. How else will we serve the public? Fine, I'll hold. Dheere... Sir, repeating my name isn't helping. What are you doing? Landline. I've exhausted my monthly cell phone allowance. I won't pay from my pocket. But, come on, my brother-in-law is a good cop. It's nothing major. Just some oil is leaking. So I'll be a little late to deliver the parcel. Parcel. Yeah, I'm at Joe's Garage, off the Turner Road. If we have time, I can get it fixed here. He had to go. He's not home. We go way back. Yeah, it will just take 20 minutes or so. I'll get it fixed. Yeah, fix the scooter first and then come here. Chacha will be back by then. I'll just apologize to him and offer him some money. Dhanendra. Your brother-in-law is here. We're illegal, according to the BMC. -What? -That's hardly surprising. Most police stations are gifted by builders. Who's this? Some brute took her phone and assaulted me. It was the other way around. He got my phone stolen! What? Let me see your face. You selected today of all days to pick a fight. -Is it swollen? -Yes. Let me have a look. Got it! Great. At least we can make a report. Hey! I'm not filing a report. What do I do? She's sitting in my car. Pick up the phone. Do your work. When will you pay? When my shop reopens. I'll give the message to Pintu, Aunt. To keep the line free. Witness the FIR please. Fair skin? He wasn't short. More tall and broad. The color of the scooter is wrong. -How? Pink is pink. -No, it was more... It was more like purple. -Is that so? -Yes. How can I sign it? It's all wrong. Hey, Pintu! -She calls you Pintu now, is it? -Ugh, God, come on. You... Does this have a connection with the dating app? And why isn't she wearing her shoes? Hello? Listen! I'm ready to pay for my phone, but within reason, please. Hmm. You've changed your tune. Huh? I have an emergency in the office. Who were you talking to? First, you tell me, whose cell phone are you calling from? Well, uh, I met my neighbor. -Hello. -Please tell me who you were talking to. Why don't you guess? Pintu is here. -How do I know? Archana? -He came to meet me. No, it wasn't Archana. I have no clue. Uh, Gopi? Our plan in the afternoon is fixed, right? He's my boss. What do you want? I'll lose my job. Is this a game? Do you ever think about the poor Uncle who lives in Delhi? If there are any changes, then let me know. -Did you speak to my father? -Someone had to! You haven't picked up his call in two weeks. Call Uncle now and tell him you're fine. All right? Otherwise we're all done. then pay your bill! What are you doing with my feet? I need to go! Then who'll drop me home? Let my brother-in-law trap this psycho. Don't go it alone. Hello. Granny... I don't know. I'm out of credit maybe. Just give your number to my brother-in-law. I'll sell my car and give you the money. Okay? Note her address. Who hit you? Huh? Her boyfriend? Please don't tell this to Mom. Oh, God, you're such a blabbermouth. Hey, madam! Call the other hero from my cell phone. What? Hey! That's illegal! Your entire police station is illegal! See, here's the girlfriend's number. Should we tell Pintu about this? Let it be. Oh, uh. Hi, Granny, how are you? Uh... Whoa. No, uh, Granny, I wouldn't know how to answer. No... uh... Papa asked me to call as soon as you hand over the phone to me. -Which video? -The one you shot during the accident. Don't do that! I mean I'll do it. -My phone is temperamental. -Just like its owner. Um, do you drink coffee? I have work to do, there's no time to socialize. What if I come to you? I'll call you after I'm done with my meeting. Look... Look, I don't have all day. It's a ladies model. By Sitladevi temple, next to a school, there's a PCO run by a kid so no danger at all. -Where's the parcel? -Parcel? Where is the parcel? Which parcel, Sherlock? Oh my days! Hey! Hey! Hey! Scooter! Oh, Pinky! -My money! -My brother-in-law will pay! Yes, Mom. I'm still stuck in traffic. Get a taxi to Zapata's! Mom, I'm driving! No, don't pull over. I have credit on my phone now. that some guy left you like this. Mohit called? Mohit? Now that bastard has a name? your granny thinks that I'm the father of his baby, that you're carrying! I was taking down his number, when he hit me from behind. Add this to the report. -And mention terror suspect in the report. -First class, sir! The trial is still on tomorrow. They're yet to find Chacha. Don't panic. Hmm. We need to finish this today. The city has changed. You never leave a trace, that's why I called you back. Ramakanth! Why are you so worried? Who do you think will testify against him? People, it's 1:30 and you know what that means! It's Lucky Lunchtime time! With me are two lucky winners. Mr. Balvinder Bhalla -and his sweet nephew, Jaswinder. -Jazz! -For your children. -Sister... Maybe he's not picking up because he's shooting. Such a star! He doesn't even know we're here. Of course, he knows! And his PR team is listening in. Just tell them there was an accident on set. That will buy us some time. What about the prize winners? There's a kid from Gurudaspur I have a new peon. I'll send my cell phone with him. Huh? Yeah. and keep my cell phone with you. I'll be there. What happened? Hello? I can't talk right now. How can we not talk, huh? I have a catastrophe happening and I need your help. My catastrophe is bigger than yours, get it? Go to Radio City in BKC. Ask for RJ Archana, okay? She has to call Karan Kapoor from my phone. Whose standee I was carting around all morning. What do you do for him? PR. You love him? Public relations, media, interview, radio. Well, uh, she's waiting for you in Bandra Kurla, okay? And what am I to you? My beloved peon, Prem? Listen! You can choose a name for yourself if you want. Hello. What trap are you luring me into? No trap, I swear. A hit man is following me. He kills people and uses their phones. What crap is this? Tell me something. Did you report your phone stolen? Who reports a stolen phone, stupid? Where are you calling from? I'm at home and calling from my computer. And whose cell phone did you use to call me before? I told you it was my neighbor's phone. Boy or girl? Girl. I'll dig out the number and call it. She just left! -Go, get her! I'm not sure I trust you. -And what about my work? If I stay alive, we can discuss it. Listen to me. Hello? Where are you from? Join me for a drink! I need to change my shirt and you need to find a gift for a girl. Something that says, um, you know, "I'm sorry for today." Reclamation! Or shall we go wherever you're going? There's a quick update on Karan Kapoor. He's not missing. That accident on set was not life-threatening. Thank you so much for all your calls. We're making every effort Sir, Ms. Ira. Ignore her. Hand him your phone, now. Sorry, my phone was on silent mode. What's this nonsense about an accident on set? Which accident? What happened with the radio promo? I had to get away. The PR guy you imposed on me is a pothead. Mr. Wannabe Woody Allen who thinks he can direct. Listen, Karan, my campaign can't take negative publicity, do you get it? Where are you? On a swan boat. National Park lake. -Are you alone? -Raju's stuck to me. I am not asking about him. Send me a selfie Don't you trust me? I'm not an idiot to trust you. Did you get the bottles of cologne I sent you? My body's not in shape... anymore. So drink less. If you can't focus on our film, at least focus on the election. I'm with you. I'm just trying to get my head together. Sir, don't! Pack up here! We're off to the lake to take a selfie! Where were you? -Sit! -We'll talk later. -Why is your hat at that angle? -I'm sitting. Mom, just chill. We get around four of them daily. But, sir, pink scooter. "Terror suspect, age 30, pink scooter, checked shirt." Blah blah blah... "Last seen in Bandra. CID Gujral." -Is this shop yours? -Hmm. Do you know how to operate this? I need a number. Will you pay me for this? Of course! Come out. Whose number do you want? His. -Karan Kapoor's? -Yes. Write it on my hand. All I know is he is at his computer day and night. Now he can stop dating girls. Mom! It's not for me! Soon! Just... It needs some investment. Something that you like! Me? We have an exchange policy! Hey, Pintu! Hey, Frederico! Oh, I'm-- Don't worry! I'm with him! Uh... Oh, uh... Guys, this is Meghna. Oh, Nandini! Did you run all the way here? Okay, so when the call comes you've to tell him that you're my neighbor. Is she the same girl? -Mom, what are you... -Who did this to you? Leave it! Yeah, Meghna's neighbor speaking. This guy's still after you? Uh... Oh, you gave her phone to her peon? That's why you're calling from a PCO? Yeah, I get it. Why? Why should I give her my phone? Oh, just till 8:30? What's this about 8:30? I'll tell you later. I have Karan Kapoor's number. Note it down. No, right? I asked you to go to Radio City. And I decided to check out your PCO story first. The little guy remembers you well. Who's this? -The woman in the white sari. -And what did you find? -Video. -Hit delete then. What are you doing? That's my private video! What's the big deal? We will have to rectify your mistake. Deleted! Try acting less smart and you won't land in trouble. What's all this? Madam, we will delete it. Just not today. Until our jobs are done, I'll be your beloved peon Prem. Do you get it? Why are you doing all this? What have I done? You're going to look after me, and I'm going to look after you. Okay? I just spoke to my brother-in-law. He's wanted for murder. Enough of this. Why are you leaving? Your son is thinking about something else. There's no point lingering! At least pay for what you ordered! -Pintu, do something! -No, no, no! You expect us to pay! find-a-boy find-a-boy idiocity, okay? Give me some more. Have I opened a bank here? Huh? Sir, checked shirt! Checked shirt! Sir, catch him! Terrorist! Hey, you! Stop! Move it! You got him! What was the number? Why did you let him go? MH03 YY... -Faster, Pintu, they're getting away! -No, let's go back! I had to pay the whole bill, and I also left my glasses. Dad, you can buy new glasses. My hat is irreplaceable. Oh, Hatman. Where's your priority, lad? -Hatman? -Hasn't he told you? From the age of five he's been a crime fighter wearing different headgear. -As a child he made me tell stories. -Hatman. Hatman in the jungle... -saving animals from evil-doers. -Mom! What? You were such a cute child, Pintu. -Now he'll go prematurely bald. -Pintu. Just like me. From excessive hat wearing. -I need to get out of here! -Okay! Does she want to escape now? No, I just need to meet my peon. You can't go till we find out all about you. You love my son, and that's why you keep harassing him. -What's this rubbish? -She's more in love with Nandini. -Huh? -What? I witnessed it. What's this peck? Not here. No, no, Nandini gave her a smacker! Aunty, Nandini is a lesbian, not me. What's a lesbian? Nothing, Mom, don't worry about it. Yeah, so listen! I mean, uh... You know Bhagirath, who brought the Ganges from heaven. -Everyone knows except Godless men. -Yeah, correct so... Bhagirath had two mothers. He had no father. -That's right, no father. -So Nandini is like one of his mothers! She has saved our son. Sing with me, child. -Huh? No, no. -Sing along. It must be brother-in-law. Hey, Uncle! Okay. Who was it, Dad? You keep your eyes on the road, Hatman. -And watch out for the bumps. -Sing with me, child. Sing loudly. What's the fuss about the scooter? It belongs to some Prerna Mathur. Sing, child! The scooter was sighted in Mahim near a police station. End this. Hey. Get me a glass of chilled water. Cold... You'll find it in the fridge. Chacha had connections all over the city. There are two things about this city that you need to keep in mind. Pintu, we should go to the temple. also are highest in the world. That's for sure. Borivali National Park? What is he doing there? Nothing. He is just sad and is thinking about you. I can't come. Listen! We're a team now! Don't make me threaten you! Okay, I'll come. Oh. What happened? We're such idiots. What? You're not my second choice, child. If only we'd known about you before none of this would have happened. Where in this rotten world is such a beautiful, pure and pious girl to be found? What do you mean? with your mom in that state? Where do you want to go? Do you want to go up? Place the altar! I'm ready! Really, Pintu, you're ready? If she wants to have a family with you, marry her. Do you even care if she doesn't like me? Do you know where your logic leads us? -First, we'd get married. -Yeah. Then that child gets a Dad. Yes! That kid will need a father. I might be infertile. I just let you think that to escape. Who got the Bollywood involved? Guess what! Tell the prize winners Karan is treating them to lunch. They must be hungry. I'm hungry too. Oh, yeah, you're included. Eat with them. And keep the bill. I'll pay you when I see you. I need to fix Karan's mood. -Okay, just don't keep us hanging. -Of course. Wait there! Bye. Raju! Hop in the back. Sir, I'll drive. Please let him drive. Quickly now. Hey, listen. I'll wait here for your peon. No, no, no! Uh... Let's go. Open the barrier! Sorry, sir. Mr. Karan sprayed too much perfume on me. Abhishek Sharma? Inspector Gujral, CID. Is this about the guy who is wanted? Right, I read your crime report. Sir, my description is 100% accurate. I need to ask you something. Have you seen Meghna Shergill's peon? No, sir. Not as yet. What? I wasn't aware of that, sir. Give it to Abhishek. And make sure he stays over there, okay? Didn't you turn celibate? Yeah, I tried to, three times. Today was the fourth time I went there, but the Cosmos had different plans. What Cosmos, what plans? What nonsense! Come on! Guess what I was doing before your ego summoned me here. Tell me. What were you doing? I can't hear you. Come into the swan. No one will come. -Come to me. -No, no! Yeah... -I often think of those times... -Yeah? So I thought of giving you a small funeral. I'll organize a small funeral for you! Psst! Raju! It cleanses you. And sometimes eliminate them which is why a funeral was required. Of course, in your honor I'm not in love with you. Sometimes in life... So I got in a rickshaw, you took of me at Holi in the shower washing off color? Such as? Such as, I thought I looked good in it! What is it, Raju? Sir says the CID want your phone. CID? An inspector is on his way. -Tell him I'm coming! -Sure. The guy who has my phone... Is he the one who called me? Yeah, I had to give him a job. Has he seen the clip? Meghu, why didn't you delete it? I was going to, after your funeral! If CID finds the clip your career is over. Forget me! You're just wearing paint! Where are these people? Meghu... I've never seen such a crazy girl! Why doesn't this move? That's quite a big bill, it includes the hats too. Are you feeling better, baby? Ya! I suddenly got a spurt of energy! Is it from the lake breeze? Yeah, yeah! Really? Sorry, I was moody before. Listen, I'm off to meet those prize winners now. Oh, you're coming! Missing you, a tad. You forgot about us so we set out from Zapata's! How could we forget you? Are you near the park? I'd love to meet you. Sorry, what's your name? Prem? Wow! Fit for a hero! And you? I'm Abhishek. Meghna is with Karan. Bring the prize winners to the gate. CID needs to check Meghna's phone. Did you say CID? Don't worry. They want her call records and that video. I hope the video is still there on the phone. Are you this shameless? What's shame got to do with it? I'll not talk to anyone but madam, okay? What the hell is going on? Bossy peon, man. Hey, hold on! Where are you going? Why is peon Prem so confused? You hurry home. What do you mean? Karan, we're reaching. No, no, no! Meet us in Film City, not the park. CID are coming! Turn around! Go back! Fraud. I'm going to continue driving. Just remember, I've done what you asked. Now it's your turn! What do want from me? You don't want your scooter from these guys? Scooter? Which scooter? Hey. -Is this for Karan Kapoor? -Yes, he ordered us to do this. Stop honking! Shut it! I've got this. Stop. Stop here. You want to meet Karan, don't you, Jazz? -Karan! -Yeah. Sir has to rush to set. Over here, ma'am. -Prerna, who? -Mathur. I've never heard of her. I need to meet your peon, right now. You... He's here! Peon. -This is-- -Yes, he is my peon. -Fiancé? -Go home! I asked you to leave. Meghna Ma'am? Your phone. I got my phone back, from my peon. Why? -The bill for lunch. -Oh. Who gave you this? The guy on the scooter? The guy on the scooter. -Where is he? -I'm the peon. Huh? Thank you, sir, she has her phone. I'll ask Mrs. Angre to get you promoted. Mr. Karan. There's a hitman after me. He kills people and uses their phones. Let's go, Meghu. I need to tell Ma'am something else. What if I get whacked? What else? Unblock the road! You come with us. Meghu, let's go! -One minute! This is evidence. -Hey! Give me something. -Take my card. -Give it. Hey! -That was a superb stunt! -Get out! Out I said! Step aside, Dummy! What did you call my nephew? Get out! -No, brother, don't! -Get out! Hey! What did you say? Hands up! Hands up! Who are you freaks? The wife you banged was like a car to me, sir. Who are they? -Where's the camera? -They're prize winners! Prize winners who won a stupid scooter. They're just fans. Case closed. -What are you doing? -Sir, one minute! My peon here was simply delivering it. You just told us he's your peon. There's a new peon for a new day. That's the film industry! How long have these delivery guys been working for you? -One month! -Shut up. -I'm talking to her. Quiet! -Correct, sir. It's been a month. -Sharma! Lock him in the jeep. -Huh, me? You might be helping the wrong guy! Sir, sir, my phone. I will vouch for him. -Really? -Yes. Then you'd have to come along. -Sharma! Take her into custody. -What? -How am I involved? -Move it, Miss. Give me my phone, please. What's got into you? I'm in love with you, you idiot! Is that your fiancé? You can lock her up, and I'll get her out! -You don't know me! -Of course, I do. I wish I could be reborn with your face. What's your badge number? Which station are you from? Here's my badge. -Please, sir, let's move. -Back away. Hey, Raju! Give me my phone! I'm going. -You'll be hearing from me! -Step away! Call the Commissioner. It's a Maruti gypsy. 6881. You forgot about me? No, no, there's definitely a Karan Kapoor connection. Well... Does the stolen phone have a video on it... that's got everyone excited? Is that so? Hello? Commissioner, this is Karan here. Step out. Don't try to run. Who is Prerna Mathur? No idea. Hmm. Did you steal the scooter? Did you? Yeah. What's in the parcel? I don't know. -Where is the parcel? -I don't know. Where is the parcel? I've no clue. Don't shoot! She doesn't know anything. If you shoot her, I won't tell you anything. You're threatening me? It's by Chacha's place! I already searched his place! You need to take me with you. Please, just let her go! Say goodbye. Of course, it was a stunt, Jazz. I was acting too. This is Filmcity. People shoot here. Meghna ma'am! Are you done with the shooting? How many times do I need to tell you? Do you want to blow us up with your phone? Papa? Papa is in Mumbai? Gujral! Deputy Home Minister Irawati can easily unmask this witness! Use that video Karan took to put the squeeze on her ladyship, hello! Please tell me you've noted Gujral's badge number and his station. Hey, Dheere! What's Gujral's badge number? I didn't take it. We need to involve the Police Commissioner. He's bound to know something. After Karan Kapoor punched me he called the Commissioner to complain about Gujral. All your indiscretions will become public right in the midst of my election campaign! Who's this? Inspector Gujral, CID. We found a video on this phone. What kind of video? The kind that ruins lives. Actually, Meghna Shergill's peon is in my custody. The peon was blackmailing her, but his real target was you. What does he want from me? The name of a witness. Hey, listen. Why don't you get to the point? One moment. To protect the witness from these goons, we need extra security. I am ready to volunteer. It's my duty after all. You have a word in his ear. Mr. Gujrat, this, uh... video... I want to see it. Ira. Ira, listen to me-- If your friend is really lucky, she may just lose one leg. How much did Chacha pay you? 300 rupees. He used to make bombs. Mostly to entrap people for the Encounter squad. Wherever your parcel is delivered at whatever time... We will soon find that out. Pray to God it's not RDX. It's not your fault. You're the delivery boy who delivers on time, guaranteed. You're a man of your words and you'd give your life. Uh, at least her belongings are here. -Yes, madam, tell me. -Sorry to trouble you on Sunday. It's about the Star Witness case. The Pandya case. The government should perhaps provide extra security to the witness. He's the one who threatened Karan today. Don't worry about that. It was a misunderstanding, in fact. It will be better if you stay out of this, ma'am. Why? I am the Deputy Home Minister. But there's no time to check out Gujral. All of us are responsible, ma'am. Ah! So... I'll tell Gujral. He'll contact you. Roy, search the system for a CID Gujral. Uncle, it might be RDX. RDX? She's to arrive at 8:30. What has St. Anne's Church to do with this? I don't want backup. I said I don't need back up! Who is our back up? When he's in position, connect us. Why didn't you mention St Anne's? How does he know? We've been roaming around since morning! Why didn't you tell me? A courier's code is silence! There's a tap on both phones! A tap? Look, I don't know who's chasing who, I just don't want that girl to die in a bomb blast but-- Rathore, listen up. This concerns national security. and there is one more target that you need to identify. -Look, Dheere. -Huh? Our country's two heroes, looking in the same direction but with different weapons. A bit like us. You pack a pistol. I don't. Giving you a pistol would be a mistake. They have to be fired sometimes. -Has anyone spoken to them? -No, they've been in your office. Has Gurjal made contact? No. Sorry, sir, I couldn't find out much about him. -Dig deeper! -Sir. I want transcripts from that stolen phone, now! Sir, they're on your desk. Sir, the number has been monitored since morning. On whose authority? Sir, yours. Sit over there. Monitor all phones in contact with that number. And show me all authorizations! So... How did you two hear about this witness? I've reached the location. The pink scooter is here. A woman is riding it. See who she meets at 8:30. Looks like she's delivering a parcel. -Any sign of Gujral? -Not yet. So whoever the girl gives the parcel to is our target. Alice! Who's Prerna Mathur? Please wait here. Wait here. Uh... Gujral is here. We need that parcel. Here's your parcel. And the keys to your scooter. I'm underage for a scooter. What was Chacha thinking? CID Gujral. We've been informed of a bomb. -Please move out. -Bomb? Outside, hurry. There is a bomb inside. Please leave. Sir, outside. For your safety... -Leave this here. -Please move out. Close the doors, Father. No one enters unless I say. Leave the church. Leave! What are you doing? Children! Who wants a present? What's going on? Well, Santa's friend... who looks like a camel.. More people have arrived. Gujral, or whatever he's called, is here already. They're hugging each other. Oh. Don't worry. Everyone's coming. My mummy, daddy, -my brother-in-law, the commissioner-- -Papa? He thinks I'm Mohit. If it makes life easier for you we can stay engaged. Break it off later if you like-- Alice. Gujral? Everyone's looking somewhere else. -Hatman! -Pintu! -Meghna! -What's going on? Take good care of her. Papa. My parents. What about the RDX? Hey, do you have a phone? I need to make a call, please. It'll cost you. Here, take all of it. -There's... zero credit left. -What? Where's the bomb? -Now what? -Commissioner Wadia is here. Everyone freeze! Nobody moves! God bless you. -Greetings. -Sir, family, sir. Is your entire family involved? Is this for me? -Give it to me. -One minute. Okay, the boy has the parcel. They're playing pass-the-parcel. Where's Gujral? The parcel is with the commissioner now. Kill Wadia. Shoot everybody. Get away from here! Go! Move! Go inside. The St. Anne's parcel is a decoy. I have the real parcel. Huh? Where are you? Never mind. behind Jesus's shrine which is beyond the Worli Fort. What's a Jesus shrine? Church. Which church are they talking about? It's in Koliwada. And what do we do there? Fetch the parcel. Listen. This is your phone. Take it away and destroy it. Merry Christmas. Go! which you wanted Gujral to provide, because there's no Gujral in our system. I'm sorry, ma'am, but I need you and Karan to reach St. Anne's Church at Grant Road. Are you summoning me? You decide whether you want to be summoned by the court or me. Uncle Terrorist went that way. That was Mr. D'Mello. Who is he? Police! Hands up! Where did you... What are you doing? It's me! The parcel. That's in the other church. -What? -Yeah. Then what's this? My plan was to trap Gujral. But this thug showed up. Will I have to pay for all his crimes? He thinks we're all idiots. -Put me in another jail. -Which jail? Who are you talking about? Get up!
