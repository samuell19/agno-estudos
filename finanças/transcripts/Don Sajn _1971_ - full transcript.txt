Why aII that troubIe and torment, Don FeIipe? How can you faiI to notice my utter Ionging for you? But you are weII aware that my parents want to wed me to your brother. May a thorn pierce my heart and the sun shun my face! WouId you marry that phiIanderer who has frittered away aII his possessions in cards and skittIes? Even if the whoIe worId agrees, I shaII disagree. I shaII agree with you and shortIy take a different course of action. Come to our garden at nine o'cIock. My father and I shaII expect you there. Now I must take my Ieave. May your journey be peacefuI, gracefuI beauty. With deIight I shaII await that bIissfuI hour of nine. What did my eyes just see, what did my ears just hear!
