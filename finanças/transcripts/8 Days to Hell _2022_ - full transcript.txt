I, I've been looking for Lucy. - Looking for Lucy, I told you that skirt was trouble from day one. I hope she was worth five years on the Rock. - Well, uh... Maybe I should ask you, Stan. - Why me? - Why you? I'll tell you why you. You, uh... You set me up on that payroll heist, payroll heist.

And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. (suspenseful music) - The body of Priscilla Mantis was discovered in this alleyway in the early hours this morning. Ms. Mantis' death has been strongly alleged by detectives to not be connected to the L A Strangler. The L A Strangler, who has been murdering and raping women for the last 20 years every Halloween in spite of the biggest manhunt in L A, has not been caught. Here with us today, Ms. Fillmore, to talk a little bit about her friend. What can you tell us about Ms. Mantis? - Oh my god, um... Who could do such a horrible thing? I mean, Priscilla was the sweetest, most wonderful woman I've ever known. And she wouldn't hurt a fly. What is the world coming to? - [Jennifer] I'm very sorry for your loss. This is Jennifer Fox reporting live. Back to you, Bob. - [Bob] Well, it's a wet one. Looks like nothing but rain in the forecast, Angelinos. Sure enough to dry up soon. (sinister voice laughs) (bell tolls) (somber organ music) - Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. - [Priest] What is the nature of your sin, my son? - I would walk home from school and find my mother in my bed. Always a different man. Sometimes they would beat me with belts. It hurt at first. But with time, feel good. As I grow up, I discovered my power. With my hands, I could control. Mm-hm. Cleanse the earth of the vermin and the filth. Si. Si, Padre. Finish the work of a great man. Finish his work. And together, we write our legacy. If only this day would last forever. (bell tolls) (ominous organ music) - [Priest] Patience, my son, for we always have next Halloween. (laughs) - Si, Father. (speaking foreign language) (sinister voice laughs) (foreboding music) - [Newscaster] With insufficient information to confirm it is the same virus. But after a month, only a few dozen Americans have tested positive for the ailment that has caused great concern at the CDC in Atlanta. We now go to Carrie Weems at Mercy General Hospital with the latest news. - [Carrie] Yes, this is Carrie Weems reporting live. In the last 48 hours another dozen people, mostly vagrants from the downtown area, have arrived by ambulance. From what I can see, a number of them have bloody wounds that resemble bite wounds. Whether these wounds were inflicted by animals or humans has not been confirmed by any of the medical staff here. I did manage to grab a nearby E R doctor to get the latest. - [Doctor] I've never encountered anything quite like this in 20 years. Within an hour anyone bitten has become deranged and almost uncontrollable. (moans) - [Brandy] Hey. - Hey, momma, hey. - Hey, pappy. - I wanna get my party on. - Ah, love to party. - What you think? - What you got? What else you got, that's not gonna cut it. Give me more. - Come on, Daddy's hurting. - Come on, give me more. Oh yeah, wanna help you. I wanna help you, but give me more, okay? Yo. - Come here. Give me some. - Yeah, really, is that how you wanna play? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Whoa, oh, oh, oh. Come here, yeah? (electricity crackles) (tense music) - Carlos Ochoa? (Carlos shouts in pain) (grunts) (foreboding music) (electricity crackles) (grunts) - What is this? What are you doing to me? Help! (grunts) Help! Help me! - No need to yell. - I don't understand this. What is this shit? Where am I? Where am I? - Save it. No one can hear you. You're the Carlos Ochoa who killed that prostitute three months ago. - [Carlos] I had nothing to do with that. - You really did a number on that poor woman. - I had nothing to do with that, Jack. (device beeps) - Yeah? What happened to those two prostitutes you killed in Sacramento a year ago? - I had nothing to do with that. (device beeps) - No? Police arrested you for the killings. - But they let me go. Lack of evidence, my friend. - So you're telling me you didn't kill them either. - That's right, I did not kill them. I never kill anyone. (device beeps) So now you are going to untie me. Huh, come on. Come on! - You know what this is? It's a voice stress analyzer. (hisses) Kind of like a lie detector. That beep means you just lied to me. - But this, this is not admissible in the court, senor. - Oh, they are in my court. - This is bullshit, man. Bullshit! Now you untie me, huh? This is kidnapping. - It's worse than that, Carlos. Much worse. - Okay. Okay. - I'm sorry it's come to this. But you have to understand, I have no choice. I made a vow to her, and I mean to keep it. - A vow? To who? - My wife! - I never meet your wife! - You're about to. (foreboding music) (rattling) - What is this noise? - Ever been married before, Carlos? When you get married, you make your vows to each other. These days most people make light of those vows. Beth and I meant ours. We really meant them. - Cut me loose, bastard. Cut me loose, cut me loose. - To have and to hold, from this day forward. For better, for worse. For richer, for poorer. In sickness and in health. Until death do us part. In sickness, Carlos. (Beth groans) She got the Omega Retrovirus while we were in Asia a couple months ago. It should've been me, not her. You do know what the Omega Retrovirus is, don't you, Carlos? It's been in the news. Some people call it the Z-Virus. The Zombie Virus. - Shit, man. Are you crazy? Cut me loose. I will scream. (screams) Hey, hey, help me! - This room is soundproof, Carlos. Scream all you want. Just like your victims did. (Carlos yelps) (Beth growls) - Okay. You want me, I killed them. I killed them all, okay? Please, please. (growls) - They say they're working on a cure. I pray every night they come up with one. (screams in pain) God forgive me.

Well, boys, let's go play some poker, huh? - You still owe me from last time. - Hey man, I'm good for it.

He's back. - Midnight? How? - I don't know, I heard him at the door a few minutes ago. - Yeah, but you lost him in Big Bear four months ago. - I know, I thought a mountain lion grabbed him. - There is no way Midnight made it all the way back here all by himself. - But he did, he's right there. - Are you sure it's Midnight? - Yeah. He has the same collar. It says Midnight. (foreboding music) - Hey buddy. Crazy. - Tell me about it. It's weird because I was camped out on the sofa doing a sketch of him, and then I heard him at the door. - Where did this come from? - It belonged to Mr. Torrecelli. The manager cleaned out his apartment. That's real leather. - Damn, did you see this stuff? That creep was creepier than I thought. Oh. By the way, found out how Mr. Torrecelli died. Neck was snapped like a toothpick. - So? - So this sketch looks just like Mr. Torrecelli. And then you draw your cat in the same sketchbook, and voila, Midnight appears at your front door. Here. Draw this. - What? - Just draw it, a whole stack of them. - Kenny, you can't be serious. - Humor me, bro. - Fine. I'll humor you. (tense music) Now what? - We wait for the money to roll in. (chuckles) - Oh my god, you are the most superstitious person I know. There's nothing in that one but old magazines. - Yeah, well maybe there's some Playboys in here. - Playboys? Did you just get defrosted with Dr. Evil? - Some of us like big boobs, Matthew. - What the hell? - [Kenny] I thought you said you checked the box. - I thought I di. - Well maybe you did. - [Matthew] It's a coincidence. - Look, what are the odds that you in that sketchbook draw your cat, and then your cat mysteriously appears after being missing for four months in Big Bear? And then I ask you to draw a big stack of cash, and hello, we get a big stack of cash. You know what? I blame myself. I should've had you draw like a big diamond or a pearl. - [Matthew] Or a giant penis. - No, I'm good there. Well, what are you waiting for? A nice, big, fat, juicy diamond. - I have only one page left. - So what? Once we sell that diamond, you'll be able to buy a gazillion sketchbooks just like that one. Ha! You said you thought it was a coincidence. So what are you gonna do with that last page? - I don't know. - All right. Later, bro. (door opens) ("Moonlight Sonata" by Beethoven) - Hi. Can I see? - Um, sure. Can you keep still, please? Thanks. - Matthew, let's get out of here tonight. Go to a club. Monica found a great one in Hollywood. - You know I don't like clubs, Rosie. Besides, I'm in a groove right now. I don't want to stop. - Well I do. I need a break. I need some fun. - [Matthew] Could you stop moving? - I'm going out. - Hey. Hey.

Rosie, Rosie! (phone rings) Hey. - It's me. I got a better idea for the last sketch. A mountain of gold! - Too late, Kenny. - [Kenny] What? What did you draw? - You know, even after six months, I can still draw her from memory. (somber music) - [Kenny] Shit. Rosie? You drew Rosie? - [Matthew] Yeah. - [Kenny] Why? The woman stomped all over your heart, man. Rosie going off with that biker dude was the best thing that ever happened to you. - I loved her, Kenny. I still think about her every night. - [Kenny] Oh no. Wait-- - I mean, it's not as if I expect her to show up my front-- (knocking) (cat mews) (ominous music) Who the hell could be at my door at one in the morning? (cat meows) - [Kenny] Don't open the door, Matt, you hear me? Don't open it! - Why? - [Kenny] Just don't, Matt. I should've told you, but I didn't think it would do you any good. - What are you talking about? - [Kenny] Rosie died, Matt. She went off a cliff into the ocean with that crazy biker a couple of months ago! They never found them. - What? (knocking) - [Kenny] Don't open the door, Matt. Hang tight, I'm on my way. (ominous music) (knocking) (suspenseful music) - Rosie? - No! Why'd you have to draw Rosie, Matt? Why? (ominous music) (emergency siren wails) - Want a drink? - No, thanks, bro.

You lost it at the track, didn't you? - Someone gave me a sure thing. - [Ruby] Uh-huh. - Hey, listen. Listen.

(hair dryer whirs) (Ruby screams) (electricity zaps) (Ruby moans) (tense music) (gasps) (thunder rumbles) (singing in foreign language) (serene classical music) - Well give her a pull if you like. I must warn you, though. - Hey, you give loans on rings? - It depends on the ring. (thunder cracks) Where did you acquire this? (foreboding music) - My father. He was the equipment manager and everybody loved him, so they gave him a ring too. I want five thousand. - What happened to your father? (electricity crackles) (ruby moans) - He died. - Of what? - Heart attack. - [Demond] Do you wanna sell it or pawn it? - I told you, man, I want a loan. - (chuckles) Well people in Hell want ice water. - Look, man, you gonna give me a loan or not? - You're a gambling man, Jake. How about I offer you 100 thousand for one pull of the arm? You get the gold token, you get the cash. I'll even throw in the machine. - What, a hundred thousand? Okay, what if I lose? - I get your soul. (chuckles) - What is this, a joke, huh? - No, I never joke. No, 100 thousand would solve all your money problems, Jake. - So are you like the devil? - I go by many names, many of which you could not even pronounce. Do we have a deal? - Let me see the hundred thousand. (snaps) (sinister voices whisper) Wait, how'd you do that? - That's a hundred K, Jake, all for the taking, unless maybe you're not the gambler I thought you were. Maybe the stakes are a little too high for a low-roller like you. - No, wait, wait, just give me a second. (tense music) Okay. I think today's my lucky day. - Spoken like a true sportsman. (register chimes) Sign here. You, you might want to read the fine print. - Nah, I trust you. (suspenseful music) All right, here goes nothing. (suspenseful music) (gasps) - [Demond] You lose.
