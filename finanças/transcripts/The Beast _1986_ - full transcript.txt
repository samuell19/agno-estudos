''Vanity of vanities'', said the preacher ''All is vanity'' Of the making of books there is no end and much study is weariness of the flesh That which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts Even one thing befalleth them. As the one dieth so dieth the other Ye they have all one breath So that a man hath no pre-eminence of other beast. For all is vanity. For who knoweth the spirit of man goeth upward and the spirit of the beast goeth downward to the earth All go into one place. All are of the dust and return to dust again. Yes, there's been a lot of changes in the fjord since you were last here, Helgi Yes, I was still very small when we went away. I think I was probably about 5 or 6 Long time ago that was. It was the summer your mother met Wolfgang. Long time eh? I was going to ask you... I wonder in those days was the fjord deserted then? Yes, nobody else lived there then. I can't see why you never came back before. He promised to come last year. He was going to stay off here for the whole summer. He didn't keep his promise though, did he? By the way, I'd like you two to do me a favour while you're up here. I don't want any strangers fishing in the river. If anyone asks tell them its not allowed. What sort of strangers? You know all sorts of people turn up here in the fjord these days. Just keep an eye on the place, will you? Helgi has other things on his mind now that he's a 'writer' I think you'd rather be left to finish your book, wouldn't you? Oh yeah? That's what I came here to do. What about the reindeer? Seen any yet? He hasnt talked about anything else since we got here. Yep and we've got permission to shoot one of them. Only one, mind. See that, they call it the elve's rock or worry stone Your mother was really fond of that rock, Helgi She used to sit by it whenever she wanted to get away from us. The reindeer come up here in the winter too. You can see them sheltering behind the rock sometimes. I'll never forget the time Wolfgang first went up there He was trying to creep up on your mother and give her a shock He climbed up the rock, then fell down and broke his leg. Your mother had to nurse him for weeks and thats how it all started. Its how you came to live in Germany, Helgi Its all because of that rock Of course your father took it badly at the time but its only nature isn't it? Can't fight against nature, can you? Even the reindeer know that. Eh, take it easy! What have you got in this thing? We've gpt to get it up there. Where'd you want me to put this rifle? Back there in the corner. Okay, fine. You don't want me to hang it on the line here for you? While you're staying here you will never point guns at people. What the hell's the matter with you? Don't get so heavy. I was joking. Joking? I was aiming the gun at an imaginary herd of reindeer. Makes no difference. -But the thing wasn't loaded even. That doesn't matter. -Why don't you tell him about the house? The house? Yes, yes. Place was practically falling down when I got it. Yes well, do you think its haunted? Haunted? Boo! Its aright eh? Yes it is but only with ghosts that people bring with them. But Half-tongue, your neighbour will come and haunt you alright. Half-tongue? Thats what they call the fellow who lives at the top of the fjord. He's harmless enough. Hardly ever see him except in the summer. Keeps to himself. Bit of a loner. Cracked if you ask me. You might see him a couple of times every summer. Always keep to the other side of the river. He's got some sort of thing about the fishing rights though. He comes out and shoots at our notice out there. Theres no stopping him and he neve actually does any fishing. A bit touched that one. Door's getting a bit stiff. Here we are This is the generator I was telling you about. Pretty reliable. It shouldn't give you any trouble. Up to you if you want to use it or not. Its how we get our power out in the fjords anyway. Thing takes a bit of handling, mind you. What was that noise? What? Its not switched on yet. You're hearing ghosts. Nah I'm only messing about. When you hear it slowing down get down here as fast as you can. What is it I'm supposed to do? You have to move yourself! Boarder would like a word with you, I think The bulet is spent as it happens. But it makes no difference, right? I can't see the old fool. Hope he's not around. -Hey, listen Balder Yes? You'll come vist us on the boat, won't you? If you have time? Oh yes, I'd like that. Problem is my brother and I are going to be tied up ...Over the next two weeks. -I understand. We'll keep in touch anyway. Oh, we'll keep in touch. Oh yes, we will do. Well, I'll come and collect you anyway. Thanks we'd appreciate that. So that it then. Right then, I'll be off. Best of luck with the book All the best. Thanks for all the help, Bolder. Look after yourself. Okay then, be seeing ya. Well then. Now you just keep up on erm your Beethoven. Mozart! Oh, Mozart! Mozart, thats it. And he can be difficult at times. Don't let him put you off your music. Come on Remember what I said. Okay, I'll call and see if you need anything. Or you call me. Sure you know how to operate the radio? Yeah I can work the radio Well, it wouldn't hurt for Lara to learn to use it as well. See ya! Hows it going? Same as you I'm a bit stuck at the moment. Wanna come for a walk? I need a break. Its easy! Grip the rod like this Then woosh, nothing to it. Slowly Helgy! I really like what you're writing. At least I liked the bit I read. Why don't you try get it published now? Don't wait until you think its ready. Or you'll never get it finished. You see, I'm still getting it into its final form. Too much self-criticism can get you into an extremely depressed state No, it isn't ready. Though some of its quite good I suppose. Didnt think I would but I really like it here. Only I wish I could see those reindeer sometime. Please. Give the reindeer a break. If you mention reindeer one more time today... I'll tickle you -Reindeer Come here! Okay, come right on over. If you dare. Okay I'll count to ten. One Two Three Four Five Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Bloody bastard! Bastard! Bastard! Come here! Open up! Open this door! You bastard! Helgy? Take it away! Only if you swear not to tickle me ever again. Throw that thing away. -Not until you swear Okay I swear. -Cross your heart? I swear cross my heart I'll never tickle you. I don't think that sort of thing is very funny. I don't think being tickled is very funny. You were still laughing, weren't you? Very funny. Coming home now baby coming right on home to you You know I'm really all washed up. My feet are burnt out red, honey. I'm really feeling blue Look for someone to love. All alone, its hurtin' I've had enough of having fun upstairs. Alone, burnt out. What am I gonna do with you? This is Radio Reiker the time is 10:50 And now: The Weather Report. There is a depression moving past the Faroes towards the Eastern fjords and this region will experience unsettled weather for the next 48 hours. It gets harder every time. That's a good sign. I must be improving then Meaning, I'm not. That wasn't what I said. But its what you meant. Helge, whats got into you? Relax, I'm only messing around. Its your move. Check And mate. Helgy love? -Hmm? Do me a favour. Run outside and get my jeans off the line before it rains. Okay, I'll go in a minute. Helgy Helgy? Helgy? Oh dear You saying your prayers or what? I found it upstairs. Been down here long? No, don't look at it yet. I've got a few more things to do to it first. Alright. We going to have breakfast together or what? I had a really good sleep My God, that coffee's hot. I'm going to spend all day practising. You don't realise how tough this exam's going to be. Are you going to read that Bible all day? Are you thinking of taking up theology? I do so love you in the mornings when you're slurping like that. Louder please. -Whats the matter with you now? I said this coffee's too hot. It doesn't mean I have to teach you table manners, does it? I suppose your mummy taught you all that, didn't she? In Germany -She's got nothing to do with it! I can't stand any more of you going on like that! I'm trying to concentrate! Helgy... Im not sure the kitchen table is really the right place for you to work. We've got to talk some time haven't we? Be reasonable, you spend all day working at that desk of yours anyway. I mean, I haven't got anyone else to talk to. That might be someone looking for a conversation. Morning We're with the coast offload out here. We planned on a bit of fishing in the river over there. Just thought we'd tell you. Well, I really don't think the owner would allow that. Pfft, he's not gonig to know. Well, I suppose not, but... He did say I wasn't to let anybody. You better not, okay? We'll only be an hour or two. Come on, mate. Its no skin off your nose, is it? We'll be well away by nightfall. Didn't you hear what he said? Its not allowed! Look at that. He's got a bird in there. Hello doll... -Hey, Sveny, We'll check her out later. Why didn't you leave me to deal with them? Best to keep on the right side of those sort of people. You should have been more firm with them. You know Bolder told us not to... -Alright I know all that! I know what he told us. But you saw what they were like. You can't reason with types like that. Keeping a promise is always so difficult for you, isn't it? You're unbearable! Its night. And he rushes through the streets The flaps of his coat spread out like wings. One leg is soaking wet. He's cold but born along a new vision of life. He's indifferent to everything. Gloriously indifferent. No love, no moments of affection to hold him down. He's alone in the world like a frightened beast. Trying to dig his claws into everyone and everything. He wanders through the town searching for some spark of pure energy in the wasteland of the city. In a smoky dancehall he sidles up to a girl he's never seen before. He's about to regale her with some words of clicheed flattery. but the girl's eyes are cold and hard. And instead he begins to mumble some nonsense in his own language Confusing everything together. He throws some half-baked insult at her. She tells him to get lost He thanks her But they put up with eachother til the dance is over all the same. They hardly say anything. They don't move. How ingenius instinct is How impersonal. They go out into the cold windy night pulling their hoods over their heads. and without a word they go home to sleep together. In a small house in a small forgotten backstreet His clothes lie in heaps all over the place. Like his soul A child sleeps in the next room. And theres a grey moon outside. He lies awake all night. The girl's dark hair on the pillow beside him. And he tries to forget the other girls hair. Fairer, softer, more beautiful. That once tumbled like gold through his fingers. Helgy? Helgy? Í'm sorry I'm late. I had to do a bit of thinking. Stupid I'm sorry. Yes of course I miss Mama after she left with Wolfgang. But, I can hardly remember him. I was so little. Yes Your father... He told me... He told me that... You cried yourself to sleep every night for two months. He told you that, did he? Then maybe he told you of the time we caught Mama and Wolfgang in the outhouse. He told you that? No God, how I hate him. Papa still wouldn't believe. Wolfgang came over every summer from Germany. All the way from bloody Germany to do research on the reindeer or something. Only the bastard was researching something else. And Papa never suspected anything. He imagined that Wolfgang was his best friend. Bloody stupid. Men amaze me Unless it happens right in front of them, the fools never think that anything's the matter Men are so blind, arent they? What do you mean? I don't know how to talk about it. I can't talk about it. Look, what about your father? He never really had any time for me after they got divorced. What about your mother? We don't see eachother. Hardly know eachother. She thinks I'm frivolous and irresponsible. Think think, my mum and papa its time I started earning some money. Neither of them think I'm doing the right thing. I'll shoot! I want to sleep a bit longer. You've got a lot of energy I just felt wide awake. I certainly don't feel wide awake. I want to. I can tell that. Shall we then? No Its not working. Sit there and stare at it a bit longer. Maybe you'lll get some inspiration. I'm sure the coffee will help you. I can't do it. See anything? What? Reindeer I wasn't looking Isn't it going very well at the moment? Im getting really worried that I won't finish it on time now. Gettiing it finished on time Why dont you stop worrying and concentrate on the important thing? The writing itself Well, you know me when I've promised to do something. I always do it. Come on. I've never finished anything. Not right to the end. Why should it be any different this time? I'm beginning to get worried about my exam. I havent done enough since we've been here either. You'll do brilliantly. You always do. What the hell are they doing down there? Dont think about that now. We should think about ourselves. The two of us. We've got another fortnight here. Lets try and be happy together. Yeah, lets be happy. Alright then. Lets play one more game of chess before we go to bed. Right, come on them. Hello? Anyone there? Hello? Helgy, I think the old bloke's leaving. Throw it down! -Fine Bastard! Bastard! What the hell are you doing? Helgy, don't you think we should get in touch with Balder? The bastard's leaving anyway. Look, there he is over there. But just in case he tries anything else He probably thinks he's made his point. What could be more ridiculous? Than a teenager visiting the place of his childhood? The place wasn't much more than a couple of rocks miles from anything. But a child's first anger is deeply ingrained. And that anger takes root and beds intself in the depths of the soul. And that soul inhabit the young man. He sets off into the world to live. And when he least expects it that anger wells up again. And tears through the crude reality he calls his existence. And he will never be free from this anger which drains him and leaves him helpless Not until he rids himself of it out in the street. Like a beast shedding its skin. Its an anger that returns again and again to the past in a series of vivid pictures which he can never exorcise. Picture a young biologist, an expert on reindeer. who appears one day on the hill above the farm. and changes the little boy's world forever. Picture the scruffy little boy himself. Running up the hillside in futile anger. Looking for a scapegoat, someone to lay the blame on. And the most vivid picture of all. The boy standing on the mountain. And watching the beasts who somehow embody the fate of the people at the farm. While remaining all the time unbareably innocent. And so that day when he returned to the place of his childhood, What more natural that he should look back toward the mountain. Just as he always used to. And what more natural than that he should see far away above the craggy wide open spaces. One of the beasts in the distance. There! See something? I'm not sure, Helgy. Its our reindeer. Where? Where exactly? Nah I think it must have been a piece of wood. You saw one, didn't you? Let's go home. Home? Where's that? Away from here. What for? You'd like to leave me wouldn't you? Just like before. Because you stopped believing in us. No, no its not that. Oh no, oh no. You miss all those phone calls don't you? From that idiot! Bjorg or whatever his name was! That odious creep you took in when I was in Germany. Took pity on him, didn't you? Oh yes Trouble is, it wasn't just once, was it? Not even just ten times, was it? You probably did it 100 times with that creep! When he started calling you again it really got to you didn't it? You wanted him! Whats the matter with you? You know that's got nothing to do with it. I thought we made a deal about that didnt we? Ah, the deal! Oh, well you'd better get your full value You won't admit you're in love with this half-wit just as you won't admit that you... You saw a reindeer! Now you want to leave. I don't care, do what you like! What must I say? Say you want to go home to be with him! Thats what you want isnt it? Say it, say it! Come on! Shoot yourself! Go on! Go home if you want! Me? Im not going anywhere! I'm staying here! Go on then! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Lara! Lara! Did you see the boat? -What? Did you see the boat? Sorry, I can't hear you. Out there in the fjord A fishing boat. In the fjord? -Okay, it doesn't matter. Forget it Have you received any SOS from any fishing boat in this area? Yes, I'll do that Bye now. Check Mate Fooled you there then. I'm progressing. No more to it than that I'm afraid. If it isn't the reindeer then its some mysterious boat. Hello? Sathers Fjord? Fjord base calling Sathers Fjord Hello? Hello? Sathers Fjord? Come in Sathers Fjord Fjord base calling Sathers Fjord Hello? Sathers Fjord Fjord base here. Sathers Fjord? Sathers Fjord? Come on! What are you doing? Fjord base here Sather's Fjord? Oh shit Somebody's dead. I know. Too late now but we may as well go on looking. Men have split up. Okay try up on the east side We'll meet here later. Fjord base, Fjord base. Theidis Fjord calling. Let me try. Fjord base. Fjord base. Fjord base can you hear me? Fjord base come in please. Fjord base Then one day he was standing in a busy foreign station. Hunched over, thin, his mouth tightly closed. A worn out version of himself. Finally read to make the spiralling journey to that warm point of origin. The departure is announced. The crowd rushes past Gesturing, babbling in a foreign tongue ...that fills his ears with noise but remains incomprehensible. Everything in this place is so ordered. So exact. He smiles crookedly at the nameless swarm. The train leaves slowly. Then its as if something is holding him down. As if there are chains around his body Preventing him from moving. Across the platform His familiar loneliness permeates his whole being. ...and he has no hope left. The train is moving slowly past his eyes. but he cannot see it. Forgotten memories float up like weeds on the seabed. Weaving themselves into tangles and numbing his brain with the stench of decay. He stands without moving on the empty platform. Now, nothing. Decisions are the privelege of the elite. The train is accelerating now. Quicker and quicker. As the wheels scream in his ears. Last call for you. That was the last call. He moves frantically after it ...As he feels his life disintegrating around him. He cries out desperately for help. But he's missed his last call and despair is engulfing his soul. Then the final comet passes swishhh A young man in a worn-out leather jacket stands on the platform Before vanishing into the dusty cloud of faceless people. And what about this life. Always leaves on time. And there's no calling it back! And you can add that if you want to. Oh but I forgot. It makes no difference. It doesn't matter if you miss him, does it? Let the train go, it doesn't matter where you are. You're still coming home. To the same meaningless existence. Oh yes and nobody gives a bloody shit about it. Not the slightest bloody shit about it. Sayders Fjord calling Rescue Centre. Come in please. Sayders calling, come in please. Good morning, lazybones. Going to sleep all day? All right then. I'll drink your hot chocolate myself. Guess whether its sunny or raining. How about just calling it quits? Just tell me what you're doing here. Are you writing or are you shooting reindeer? Which is it? Everything. And you know the other reason I came here, do you? Huh? I want to be alone with you. -Stop it. I'm being serious! And so am I I mean, whats all this about a bloody reindeer? Theres something wrong with you. In your head! Whats this novel about, Helgy? Oh, you know what its about, don't you? No Yeah Its about you, isnt it? Yeah, well. You know. Its... He goes back to where he used to live okay? But it doesn't feel like home to him. Because he's rootless. His girlfriend's with him out there. He goes hunting. Looks for reindeer and it all goes tragically wrong for him. But what are you trying to say? What am I trying to say? Cant you see its about us? And to us? -All of us! Look... Its all in this bit. Look... All of us were searching for a sign to something, you see? But none of us ever find anything Because we don't know what we're looking for! Thats the reason I'm not trying to say anything! I'm not doing anything that makes the slightest bit of difference! And nobody! Nobody else is either! Thats no reason to throw it away. Let it go. But that which before the sons of men Before the beasts. Even one thing before them. As the one dieth. So dieth the other. Fjord Base, Fjord Base Fjord Base. Calling Fjord Base. Fjord Base, hello? Helgy, darling... I think you ought to eat something. We're all fighting our own demons!

Theres another hunter after the deer Someone else. He's made a mistake! He thinks he killed a stag but no He didn't shoot it, really. Another man shot it and he doesn't know. Helge, at least have a sandwich. You haven't eaten anything! -That doesn't matter! Theres no point to anything now. Point that the sandwich is there to help? I'm saying ''Nothing matters''!
