Mom? Yeah, Monkey Face? Have you, told the Nebraskan family I'm gay? No. Was I supposed to? I don't know. I was kind of thinking that while we're here... maybe we don't need to make a real big deal about it. So you just... You want me to lie? No, come on. Not lie. Don, will you help me? I... You're better with words. Well, you know what, it's-it's not about you. Okay? That's fair. It's... It's about Mom and it's about Grandma. And it's about having a good time with the Nebraska family, and let's not focus on you, okay? Right. Okay. So, we should tell the entire family... that you're not really Jewish too. TAKE ME TO THE RIVER Subrip: Pix Everybody just squeeze in just a little. There you go. Okay. Everybody look at the camera. I can't get everybody... Squeeze. Squeeze just a... Say, "Go, Oklahoma Sooners." Kidding. Kidding. - Ryder, come stand back here by me. - See, I can't get... The house... The house is cut off. - You ready... ready, Don? - Yeah, Cindy. It doesn't have to be perfect, just make sure you get everyone in the picture. Why'd you take your pants off? I'm just going to move this. Ryder. Ryder, chin up. There we go. We can barely get everybody in. Okay, everybody say, "Go, Cornhuskers!" Go, Cornhuskers! Louder! Go, Cornhuskers! Cornhuskers! Did it go? Not yet, Mom. The beans has to come out of the oven. Yay! Wait, wait! One more. One more for-for safety, guys. Come on, guys... Hey, Ryder. Come here. Aikido? - Push me. - No, Dad, I'm not gonna... Come on, push me. I want to show you what happens. Push me. You see? You see what happens? You come at me, I redirect your energy. Hey, they can't fight you unless you give them something to fight against. Okay? Come on, chin up? Come on. Come on. Okay. Hey. Show me your best aikido. Great, Joe. Get that one in there. Shit! Good, Donny. Honey, give the guy a little space now. Ryder! That looks just like Ginger horse. She still has the picture from last year on her wall. Abbey. Looks like you got a fan here. Are you really from California? - Really? - Yeah. Cool. And... it is done. Yes! - Sign it. - There we go. Okay. ...how-how do you spell your name again? It's M... O... L, L... Y. I'm afraid he's gonna have his hands full with that one. All right, now say thank you. - Thank you. - Come on, now. Let him do a picture for one of your sisters. I want a mother and a baby deer. - Ask nicely, Abbey. - Please! Please! Please! Can I have... I hope he doesn't mind a bunch of girls hanging on him. It'll be good for him. What's up with his shorts? Is that a swimsuit? - Ryder? - What? Is that a swimsuit? No. Is it underwear? They're shorts. Told ya. You following us, Ryder? No. Where'd you get those glasses? The 1980s. Ryder! Yeah? Keep talking so I can find you. Hi. I'm-I'm right here. Hi. - Gotcha. - Yeah. Can you stand up a second? Ruth told me you had the shortest pants on she'd ever seen. So I need to check them out for myself. You have a lot of guts whipping these out on Grandma's farm. Ryder, I'm sorry, but Molly's refusing to let anyone tie her shoes but you. Looks like you got your hands full here. Okay. I... I can tie 'em for her if she wants me to. Yeah. Being fickle today. Can't talk reason with her. It's cool. There we go. There's the first one. And there we go. All right now, say thank you. Let's go to the hay mound like you asked for. - I want to go with Ryder. - Let the poor guy finish his dinner. I want to go with Ryder! Hey, Keith, I-I can take her. It's all right, Ryder. No, really. It's okay. - Here, come on, Molly, let's go. - All right. - I don't want you climbing those hay bales. - Yeah, we won't. Ryder. Is it true that Uncle Don isn't really your dad? What? No, that's weird. Where'd you hear that? I don't know. What, did you dad tell you that? I don't think your shorts are weird. I think they're cool. Well, thank you. I... I think they're cool too. Ryder! Hey, Molly, your dad said not to get up on those. Where are the baby birds? Do you see... see these mud things up in the rafters? Where? It's right there. Do you see the, brown like muddy thing? - That-That's the nest right there. - I see. How are we gonna get them? Molly, I think we should kind of leave them alone. How about you come up here? Why... why don't we go check out the cows? Check out the cows. I... I mean, I don't even think the, bales go high enough. We can do chicken fighting. Like... Like you getting up on my shoulders? Yes. Chicken fighting. I don't know if that sounds safe, Molly. I do it all the time. Okay, we'll do it, but you have to promise me that you're not gonna fall, okay? I know. All right, wrap your legs around my neck. Ready? I do this all the time. I bet you do. Okay, here we go. Daddy! Molly! Daddy! My God! What happened? Daddy! Are you hurt? - I'll take her inside. - Ryder, are you all right? What happened to her? - I-I don't know. - Were you there? Yeah, I was. I... Does this happen with her? - I... - What? It's okay. Just tell us what you remember. We were just... We were up in the barn and she started screaming. - What were you doing up there? - We were just talking. - Could she have cut herself? - I... I mean, we were sitting on a hay bale, so I don't think so. She was just screaming. I... Is that all? You know what, she's gonna be fine, 'cause Ruth is taking care of her. She's... Don't go anywhere. I... All right, why don't we all just go sit down a second. Everything's fine. Everything's... Molly just had a little spill. Everything's fine. Sorry. Mom, I... Just sit over here. Don't worry. She's... Just... It's probably a little, tiny thing. I... H-how is she? She's... Are you okay? Yeah. But anyway, she's settling down, so... We'll see if we can get her to stop crying... long enough to tell us what happened. Okay. Cindy, is she okay? Yeah, that's what we're trying to figure out. Do you think maybe I should go in and take a look at her? You know what, I think Keith's got it taken care of, but thank you. Did she stop crying? She's fine. I'm just gonna go sit with her. Make sure doesn't need any... - Ruth, I said she's fine! Now stay put! - All right. What is going on? I have no idea. - You kids, why don't you all go inside and play, all right? - Okay. Go inside. Boys mind moving to another table for a second? I want to talk to Ryder. Is Molly all right? I'm gonna ask you again. - I want you to look me in the eye... - Cindy, a little help. - Tell me what happened. - Keith, I would be happy to go in and examine her and... I just did that. Well, so does she... does she have a laceration or what did you find... - No. - We were sitting on the hay bales... And she was reaching for a bird's nest and she just started crying... Has she started her cycle yet? That's all that happened. I... - What? - Has she begun menstruating? - Her period. - Yeah. Keith... She's nine years old. For Christ's sake. Well, it can happen very early. Well, maybe in California... Keith. Look, it's not exactly common, but you said it didn't look like the blood was coming from a cut and I... Why don't I just go in and take a look at her... - and we'll get to the bottom of all this. - No! Keith... Nobody touches her! Please, Keith, you have to let me examine her... so that we know how to help her. - The last thing I need is you playing doctor. - Okay. Okay. Keith, look, what's important right now is Molly's safety, all right? And we are only here... All of us... to help. You want to help? Keep your son away from my daughter! Take Mom inside, please. Evelyn, maybe it's a better idea if you were to go inside. Don, just... You didn't do anything wrong. You didn't do anything wrong. - I tried. - It's okay. It's okay. Just come sit down and talk to us for a second, okay? All right, Keith is just a little bit worried about... About, Molly right now. Do you think I did something to her? No, no. I couldn't have done anything to her. I know, and... everybody knows that. But, Mom, I... I physically couldn't do anything to her. Okay, you know what, this is not... We should tell everybody now. I mean... I know these people, and they're not very accepting. If you say something now, it's just gonna be one more thing. You follow your mom's lead here. Why can't anyone in this family just tell the truth? Honey, hey... I am going inside! Am I allowed to do that? Molly's in the bedroom. Well, why am I so... Hey, Ryder. Can you draw my picture now? Hey, hey. - Hey, hey! That's enough! - I said keep him away from my daughter! - We are not using violence around here, all right? - Did he hurt you? Ruth? Ruth. Go get your girls and tell them it's time to go home, all right? - Cindy... - No, Ruth. Don't tell my wife what to do. Sit down! Don't tell my wife what to do and don't tell me to leave my own property! Why are you doing this to me? Keep your boy away from my family! - You fucking asshole. - Cindy, let's go. Let's get in the car. Will you just tell them please? Quiet! This is so stupid! Just be quiet. Ryder, let's go. Let's get in the car. Cindy, let's go! Everyone, just cut it out, all right? Everyone is family! Cut it out! Mom, tell them, please. All right, Ryder, please just listen to your dad. Let's just calm down. Fuck you, okay? - Hey, hey, hey! That's not helping! - I don't care! I don't care what you think you stupid, fucking rednecks! Ryder! Ryder. Ryder! You hiding? No. What are you doing then? I... I don't know. Not hiding. All right. Well, we'll see you around. Hey. See the alfalfa blooming? I brought you some long pants. This warm sweatshirt. Keith can fly off the handle a bit sometimes, but he really is a good guy. He's an asshole. Don't say that. He's your uncle. You say he's an asshole all the time to Dad. I don't think I do. So... let me talk to you a second. Grandma thinks it... Might be best if you could stay out here tonight. Here? Like in here? It's just for one night. That'd give everyone a chance to get comfortable with you again. She thinks I did it. No, no, no. Come on. Why am I the one that has to stay out here? Because she knows you're a smart kid, and you're gonna be the bigger person... and you can help us fix this. What am I supposed to do, hunt for food? Me and Grandma fixed up a nice picnic supper for you. - You shouldn't have. - Well, we got to get some food in you somehow. You'll be eating off these leftovers for a week. Why are you talking like that? Like what? You're just talking different and I think that's weird. I don't think I'm talking different. You wouldn't normally say "eating off these leftovers" if we were at home. Why wouldn't I? Because you don't talk like that. You've been talking differently since we got here. I don't think I'm talking differently. Well, it's annoying. - You sound like an idiot. - Well, I... I think you're making it up, so... I'm not. There it's not called "supper," okay? And lunch is definitely not called "dinner." That's just confusing. Mom. Fuck. Mom... I'm sorry, Son. I thought you were asleep. I was asleep. I just came to bring you a blanket. I don't need a blanket. Ryder, you're cold. No, I'm not. Gosh, this place is a lot shabbier than I remember it. I used to hide in here when I wanted to run away from home. Mom? Yeah? Why does Keith hate you? What? Why do you say that? Keith and I... See, when Grandpa gave up the farm, I got money to keep going to school... and, I guess, Keith wasn't real happy about that. But, at the same time, he got to inherit all the land, so... And you... You are lucky... because you are... the only one. You are the only Monkey Face. I can give you as much as I want. Mom... Mom. Stop. Go back to sleep. Sorry I woke you. - Mom? - Yeah? What are you doing? Nothing. Just go back to sleep. Mom... Is that a sleeping bag? Yeah. Why do you have a sleeping bag? I'm just gonna take a little nap on the floor here. No. Are you serious? Of course I'm serious. Mom, go back inside. Come on. It'll be like when we used to go camping. Mom, this isn't funny. Go back inside. Ryder, I want to stay here with you. Will you go back in the house, please? You know, this isn't easy for me either, Ryder. Just go back to sleep. You can pretend I'm not here. Mom? Yeah, honey? I really don't want you here. Mom? Yeah. Actually, what time is it? - Can you come outside? - What? - What happened? - Just put your robe on and come outside. What's going on, Ryder? You... come here. I want you to move the car around back. I gonna get something to take off that pitch, but we got to move it before Grandma wakes up. - You want me to move it? - Yeah. Do you know where Grandma feeds her cats? - Yeah. - Okay. Fuck. Who would do this? Are they trying to scare me? See, look. We're gonna have this fixed up in no time. ...there was... There was motorcycle tracks near the car. Who's got a motorcycle? Should we follow them? Mom? And what would we do then? Darn it. Okay, Grandma should be waking up about now. Just keep scrubbing. It's starting to work. I'll come out in a little and help out. Wait, I have to clean all this? Sorry, honey. Who could that be? Abbey. What are you doing here? Did you walk all the way from home? I rode. I see. Did someone come with you? No. The other one's for Ryder. Is he here? Yes, he is. Honey, there's someone here to see you. Do you want to come in and get some pop? It's hotter than heck out there. No, thanks. I'm fine. Okay. You-you remember Abbey. - Yeah. - Molly's sister. My dad wanted me to say sorry to Ryder for yesterday. He wanted to say sorry because he was angry and he shouldn't have yelled. And he doesn't want Ryder to be afraid of him or mad at him. He-He... He hopes that Ryder will have dinner with us today at our house, and he sent me to pick him up. Just Ryder or... I don't know. You could call him. But I only brought one extra horse. Well, we can take the car. Why am I the only one invited? I don't know. Did he say anything else? He said he just wanted you to feel welcome at our house on your own. But only if you want to. Why don't I give Keith a call? Mom, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. Are you sure you don't want to come in... and have a little something to drink before you go? No, thank you. He didn't want me to stay long, so I'll just wait here for Ryder. Mom! Yeah. Coming. I think it was Keith who wrote on the car. What? Where are you getting that? Yeah, he's trying to scare me. Can we let today be peaceful? What's happening? I have to go over there. Are you sure that you want to go deal with him again? What kind of... What? Hey, hey, hey, hey! Honey, what are you doing? - You cannot wear those to Keith's house. - Yes, I can. Honey, be smart. I am being smart, Mom. Listen, I know you are set on not listening to your mother right now, but you do not know Keith the way I do. This is not the time to make a statement. This is the time to try to smooth things over. I am not lying anymore. Will you get that through your head? The Ryder I know is smarter than this. Go. You know how to ride? Yeah. We should go now. Dad said to be home by dinnertime. Don't pull on the reins. Just follow. I thought that there was a road leading to your house. There is. This way is faster. Dinner will be ready soon. Jesus Christ. Is it always this hot out here? Whiskey, come on. There's the house. Hey. Give me your rein. All right. Come on. Hey, Daddy. You guys are just in time. How you doing there, Ryder? All right. Come on. You've got to shake my hand better than that. I feel like I'm shaking a dead fish. No, it's all... It's all in the grip. Like... There you go. All right. You're welcome in my home, Ryder. Any time you need. All right? Well, all right. Okay, come on inside. Girls are waiting for you. You almost ready, Ruth? Yeah. I was just waiting on you men. Gotta put this salsa on the table... and we are ready to go. Hey, Mr. Ryder. Where are your folks? They're back at Grandma's house. Well, that was nice of them to let us have you today. Run and get seven settings, honey. - We're having tacos. - I hope you like tacos. Yeah. No, that sounds good. Probably nothing compared to what Grandma's been feeding you. It smells great. It's kind of a serve yourself sort of deal. - Ready for Molly? - I think so. Molly! Dinner's ready! Hey, why don't you take the head of the table today, Ryder. Ruth, you there. Ryder, can I get you some pop? Sure. Girls, you all want pop? Yeah. Okay. Everyone give me your cups. Is Molly still in her room? I called her in. Molly! We're waiting on you. Thank you. There she is. Hi, Molly. Let's eat. Yum. So, Ryder, I was meaning to tell your mom... about this, winery... I guess you'd call it, that just opened east of town. I read about it in the paper. It seems like they've got quite the operation. Really? Yeah, and I was thinking to myself, you know, Cindy's family always brings wine when they come into town. I'll bet they'd enjoy this. Yeah, that-that sounds good. They ever let you taste wine? 'Cause you're not 21 yet, are you? No. I'm 17 but, yeah, like, you know, at dinner they'll let me have, like, a glass of wine. Hey, Ryder. Which of these girls looks the oldest to you? What? Forget about who's actually the oldest. Which one looks the oldest? I-I don't know. Well, you don't have to get it right. I... Molly, I guess. Okay. Now, which one... Which one's the next oldest? I-I really don't know. Just guess. Okay... I guess one, two, three, four. Fair enough. Guess we have to get you some new clothes then, Abbey. Hey, Ryder. We heard about your big news. You, won some sort of trophy at your school? Yeah, it was... It was a songwriting competition. It was last year. Basically, wait... How do you know about that? Grandma must have told us. She gives us little updates about you guys every once in a while. But... Yeah it was... You... Tell me again, you wrote a song? I wrote a song and then, I played guitar with it. - And it was part of, some school thing, right? - Yeah. Yeah. See, that is so neat to me that schools out there have things like that. I guess it's pretty cool. Yeah, so... Well, maybe we'll have to have you sing it for us. Sure. I... Like-Like right now? Or... Don't you need your guitar? I mean, I could sing it a capella... if you want. Well...okay. Yeah, that-that would be nice, if you'd like to. I didn't know we were gonna get serenaded today too. All right, now, everyone, no eating while Ryder's singing, okay? So the, the song is called All The Way. There's a... There's-There's another verse. And... That was very nice. Wasn't that nice, Keith? Very. Yeah. Well, Ryder, it certainly is a treat... every time we get to have you back on the farm, even if it only is for a couple days. Gosh, sometimes I get so sad thinking about you and your mom and dad... all the way out there with no family around. Well, I... I mean, we have a lot of friends, so, it's... You got any special ladies out there in California? Grandma told us that you're not seeing that Julie girl anymore. No, no. We were just friends. Come on. I bet you've gotta fight them off... with a voice like that. I... I don't know. Come on, be honest. Are you a heartbreaker? Or are you just teasing, like your mom used to do? Keith. I'm taking to Ryder. Not-Not-Not really. Why not? I don't know. I... Can-Can I use the bathroom? Of course. - It's over there? - Just on your right. Thought we lost you there. No. Sorry, I didn't know if you were done or not. - No, that's okay. - Sweetheart, can you grab that? Can I help with anything? No. Don't worry about it. I got it. Girls, can you please help me gather up the place mats? Molly, why don't you show Ryder your room? Show him your new trophy. Okay. You all right, Ryder? Yeah. What's the matter? Nothing. Abbey, leave them alone. Come here! Sorry, I... Is that... Is that your trophy? Yeah. It's cool. Hey, are... Are you okay? Like-Like from yesterday? Yeah. So, pick a number. One, two, three or four. Four. Pick purple, black, orange or yellow. Black. Pick green, blue, white or red. Blue, I guess. What does it say? What? What does it say? Wait... Kids having fun? Being awful quiet in here. Hey, Ryder. Why don't you come outside with me for a second? Come on. Did your mom ever tell you why she left here? She... She got into UCLA, right? She left because she thought she was better than all this. Is that what you think? No. I... I hope not. You strike me as someone who's never held a gun. Am I right? Yeah. I-I... No. I mean, I've held one before. Yeah? Did you fire it? No. Do you think you'd know how if you needed to? I-I don't know. See, Ryder, I was thinking yesterday after the picnic, there are a few things you should learn... they probably aren't teaching you in California. You look like you might about curl up in a ball if someone threatened you. I mean, if someone really threatened you with a weapon. I think the least I could do is show you how to use one of these. Go on. Now push this button here. This is the clip. See the ammo inside. You're fully loaded right now, but you can't fire it until you cock it. So if I pulled the trigger right now it would go off. Yep. But it might knock you over if you held it like that. You hold it back here, in a holster behind you. Now get your finger off the trigger! - You never hold your finger on the trigger. - Right. You hold your finger against the side of the gun... until you're aimed and ready to shoot. All right. Now, you draw with your right hand and step forward with your left. One fluid motion. Bring your left hand up to meet it. Hold it with two hands. There you go. Your left arm is in front to protect your vitals, and your right arm will take the kick. N-Now do I put my finger on the trigger? Yes, you would, but don't do it yet. Let's say you fired off eight rounds... and he's still coming at you. You want to reload. If you were really firing, the last bullet would have pulled the slide back like this. Now pop out the old clip. That button. Keep your ammo here. Put the new clip in. Press down that slide lock right there. Now you're ready to go. That fucker's gone. When you have a gun, you don't have to be scared. You're ready to protect yourself. Protect your family. Now this is a sign of trust between us, Ryder. Do you trust me? Yes. Are you saying that 'cause you think it's what I want to hear? Or do you really trust me? I-I don't know. All right. Now give me the gun. I'm glad we got to speak today, Ryder. Molly will be right out. Aren't you coming? Do you know how to get to Grandma's. Of course I do. Come on. Let's go. Is your dad mad at us? Molly. No. Why was he acting like that? Like what? Like at lunch. I don't know. Molly, I'm serious. I mean... What's going on? Wasn't he making you feel uncomfortable too? I don't want to talk about that anymore. Is this the way we came? I don't remember going through this when we came here. You know where you're going? Yep. What... Isn't the house back that way? But there horses need a drink first. Molly? What... Hey, what are you doing? Going swimming. I thought you were taking me home. I am taking you home, right after we go swimming. Molly, I'm-I'm not going swimming. Why not? Because I don't have a swimsuit. You have shorts. Molly, what are... No! Hey! Don't... M-Molly! Hey! Don't you like swimming? D-Don't... Will you not go any farther, please. I... Fuck. Okay, just stay right there. Okay? I'm coming. Stop. It's cold. Come here, come here. What are you doing? Stop. Okay, okay, okay, okay! What are you always giggling about? Your sunglasses. What about them? - You're not gonna take them off? - No. You can't swim with them. Yes, I can. Can I wear them? - Can you wear them? - Yep. I don't know. What? Okay, you can wear them... Hey, hey. No, no. You can wear them, but you can't get them wet. Okay? - Okay. - Okay? Here. Do I look like I'm from California? Yeah. Nice. I'm from California. If I wore these to school, all my friends would be like, - "Where did you get them?" - Yeah? And I'd say they're from my California cousin. I told all my friends I have a California cousin. - Yeah? - Yep. And I also showed them the pictures you drew. Do you... Do you know anybody else that draws? Yeah, but they're not that good. You're a lot better. A lot better. Who's your favorite cousin? I don't know. Okay, okay. Maybe you. I mean, I don't know. I don't really know all my cousins. Stop. I have a boyfriend. - You do? - Yep. None of my other sisters ever had one before. Abbey's mad because she's older than me. But I'm prettier. Don't you think I'm prettier? Hey, hey, hey! I think you're pretty. I think you're pretty. I do. I think you're pretty. I always do everything before Abbey. Do your parents know about your boyfriend? They don't know about him. Would they be mad? I don't know. You know, you're like nine. Yeah. So, then... are you, like, the most popular girl at your school? I don't know. Maybe. Hey. All nice and pretty. Pretty. What? How come you always come to Nebraska and we never go to California? I don't know. Hey, maybe you should come visit sometime. - Really? - Yeah. Nice. I don't want to live here anymore. Why not? Your whole family lives here. They're not my real family. You mean you're adopted? No. You're making my glasses all wet! Hey! - Come on. - Mud! No, no, no. What are you doing? Chicken fighting. Chicken fighting? Who are we gonna chicken fight? I don't know. Well, it's not fun unless we have someone to chicken fight. Okay, where we wanna go? Where we wanna go? What, are you copying me? Molly, you're kind of squeezing me. Molly. Molly. Molly? Hey. Are you asleep? Yes. Ryder. What? Close your eyes. Why? Just do it. And count to 50. Why? It's a game. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50! Molly? Molly! Molly, this isn't funny! Where the fuck are you? Molly! Ryder? Your mom was about to send out a search party for you. We heard you folks are leaving tomorrow, so we just thought we'd drop by to see you off. Honey? Hey, come on. Sit down with us for a second, all right? Just join us. Come sit here. Sit down. You want some malted milk or something? No. No, thanks. So, Molly was saying... the two of you went swimming today. I was just telling your mom and dad... how much we enjoyed your singing today. We always knew you could draw. I think I knew you liked music, but I don't think we ever actually heard you sing before. He is our singer, all right. He's got it. Who needs a, home stereo when you got this guy? Seems like you're just one of those all-around artistic people. Probably could do anything you set your mind to. Listen, Ryder. I just wanna make sure that you and, well, and your folks know... how sorry I am about what happened yesterday. You're a good kid. And you're honest. Your mom raised you right. And I trust you'd never do anything... but be a good father figure to Molly. I don't wanna go on about it, but... I hope we can let this rest now. Ryder. Yeah, we can. Okay. Good, good. So... we're all a family and we're gonna... We're gonna go on being a family no matter what. Wouldn't have it any other way. All right. Well. Good, then. Hey, did you show Ryder your chicken fighting down at the river today? Yeah? Did he know how to play? He didn't? Didn't your mother teach you that one, Ryder? She used to love that game when we were little. She was always asking me to go down to the river with her... to go chicken fighting. Cindy? What is this... What is chicken fighting? How about you, Ryder? You like chicken fighting too? Did I just miss something here? Your grandma always thought that game was my idea. But it was really yours, wasn't it, Cindy? Supper's probably waiting on us, Molly. Give him back his glasses. What was that all about? Mom? Mom, look at me. I'm sorry. - It's my fault. - It's my fault. I was just so... I was so young. I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't know what I was doing. We can go home tomorrow. And we don't ever have to talk about this... or think about it again. Okay, honey? You did nothing wrong. You keeping an eye on the clock, buddy? Yeah. Hey, I'm gonna make, one more pass through. Any music requests?
