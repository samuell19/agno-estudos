Some anthropological-type guys claim that prehistoric horses had larynx muscles in their throats. [Clearing throat] Recent findings suggest that this gene actually had been passed down for generations. Some primitive cultures believed that the equine was created in god's image-- noble, mighty, brilliant, sublime! It was only after he finished perfecting his masterpiece known as horse that god turned his attention to the lesser animal. Look at this guy. Ha ha ha! O.k., honey. Come on. I don't know why we have to keep hiding like this. Honey, your wife's been dead for two days! I know. But the funeral. The funeral doesn't start for a good hour. Oh, son of a bitch. For god's sake! Buenos dias, señor. I'm not here, Carlos. Very sorry to hear about your wife. Right, right. Not now, for Christ's sake. [Muttering in Spanish] First it was your office, then it was the motel 8. Why can't you take me somewhere by the ocean with room service? I can't wait till we get married. I don't know if I remember how to make love in a bed anymore. Walter. Huh? Walter. That horse. What about him? I don't know. It's like he knows something. Louise, come on. Walter! Walter. Walter! What? It's that horse! What about him? Can't we use blinders or something? All right. Not me, the horse. Hmm. Next week-- dog meat. Hi, Carlos. Your stepfather no here. He's in stall 47. Aah! [Horse neighs] Fred. M-M-My mother just died! Think this is easy for me? Aah! Aah! Ha ha ha! Buy 10,000 shares of cromwell from Mrs. Bucktad. But we just sold 10,000 shares to her. We did. Oh, right, the commission. Right. The commission. Every time we buy or sell a stock, we make a commission. That's how we make our living. Just buy the stock. The old bitch is made of money. She won't even notice. Have you seen the moron? Fred? No. Tell him I want to see him. Yes, sir. Allison. Aah! Sorry. Oh! It was my fault. It doesn't matter. Are you doing o.K.? Yeah. Well, if there's anything that I can do... Just let me know. I'm telling you, Jack, we never officially changed ownership of the damned business! She left her half to him! Well, wha-- yes, reverend. Yes. God bless you, too, sir. Oh, Freddy, this man... He makes it a little easier. I'm sorry, Freddy. Sit down. You know, Fred, times like these, I always felt people should be close to those they love. Yeah, right. Freddy, what do you think of me? Um... I--i--i don't want to be rude, but, uh, I think you're, like, the lowest scumbag on the face of the earth. But do you like me? Oh, that's not important. Let me just come right to the point. I have a copy of your mother's will. You may or may not know this. We kept half of the brokerage in her name for tax reasons. Because her death was so sudden, we didn't have time to change the darn thing. She's left all her assets-- that's one horse and, uh... Half the brokerage-- to you. So that means half the firm is--is mine? Well, legally, yes. That's why I think you're going to be a very happy young man. I'm prepared to buy you out at what I think is an excellent price. What if I don't want to sell it? Once again, you'd be stupid. You take this offer. Trust me on this. There you go. That's cash-- mostly cash. Hi, Fred. Walter asked me to pack your things for you. Every dog has his day, Sawyer. Aah! Aah! O.k., so where's Don? Straight ahead. I could probably, like, sell this thoroughbred for a lot of cash, right? [Coughs] Señor chaney, this is Don. Is he sick? No. He always looks like that. He's all yours. Buenos noches. Thanks. That Sawyer, the guy ain't... Ahh! He's such a... Dick? Ha ha ha! Yeah. Fred, we've got to talk. Aah! Aah! Aah! Jesus! Don't scream like that. Aah! [Telephone rings] Hello. Listen, Sawyer! I know what you're trying to do, and it's not going to work! Fred, come over here. Come on. Come on. Now, listen, Fred. Now, Fred--aah! [Mumbling] ...talk! Aah! Would you calm down? We've got to talk. There's an old truck parked out back. I left the keys under the visor. Let's get out of here. Oh, fresh air! Now, where was I? I speak human, giraffe, worm, toad, whale-- humpback and sperm. You might say I'm a four-legged Dr. Doolittle. So, Don, do all horses speak English? What, are you kidding? Look, all horses can understand English, but only the chosen can speak it. What about, like, Mr. Ed? Mr. Ed! [Spits] That's what I think. Every word was dubbed! His lips were moving. A stagehand was shoving a carrot up his butt! I guess you're curious about my childhood. Not particularly. Well, I was raised on a small farm. Oh, I was restless. Wild, I guess you could call it. My old man and I never got along. Finally, I just split. A few weeks later I met Gideon Cole. Oh, he was a great blues singer. He was a blind man. You know, for a while, I had him convinced I was a short, hairy Italian boy from the Bronx. Terrible, I know, but it's true. Hey, Gideon, my hoofs are killing me. What the hell? God, that Gideon! He had a terrific sense of rhythm but a real shitty sense of balance. He used to stand on the edge of the boxcar. One day the train made a sudden stop, he went flying off. I guess he's riding that great freight train in the sky... Or spitting out dirt. After that, I met up with your real father, Dave.

You know, we saw blue Hawaii 12 times. When he died, and your mother married Sawyer, I stayed in the stable. I haven't spoken to anybody in a long time. I'm glad you came along, Fred. You're a talking horse. You could make a fortune. Sure, you just get up in front of people and talk. Ha! Go public, do the talk shows-- letterman, donahue, Carson, Geraldo Rivera. Oprah Winfrey! It's not that easy, Freddy boy. I wish it was. The talking world can put an unbelievable amount of pressure on an animal, especially when you're a horse. For example, take my brother Lou...Please. You'll like Lou. You've got a lot in common. Oh! Oh! Oh, oh, oh! My proboscis! Doctor, this operation shall go down in history. Fred, watch this. Ha ha ha! Paging Mr. Horse, Mr. Lou horse. Paging Mr. Horse. I'm Lou. Jeez, Lou! Are you stupid! Hello, Lou. Woo woo woooble woo! Certainly. Good to see you, too. Where's mom and pop? Look who's back. Pop, this is my friend. Is it male or female? I can't tell when they have clothes on. It's a guy, pop. His name is Fred. It's a pleasure meeting you, sir. [Neighs] Hey, and this is my mom. She doesn't talk, but she understands. [Neighs] Ma, I can't ask him that! She wants to know what it's like to face somebody during sex. Since you're here, come in. ♪ Meow meow meow meow ♪ ♪ meow meow meow meow... ♪♪ He never writes, he never calls, now he brings home a human! You know how they are. He probably wants something to eat. Fred, listen to me. Never have kids. They'll break your heart. Look what we ended up with-- James Dean and the fourth stooge. You know when I think Lou started to crack? When? When he saw the godfather. You know, that scene... With the horse's head. Yeah, that was his favorite actor. Well, um, it was a pleasure meeting you, but, um... It's getting kind of late, and I've got to head back into town. Good luck with Lou. Goodbye, Don. What? Hey, Fred, wait up. [Neighs] You think I was hard on him? What are you going to do with your half of the business? I guess I'll sell it to Sawyer. Do you know anything about the stock market? Not much. I used to work at the brokerage, but Sawyer kept me in the mail room. Said I didn't have the right image. It was depressing, so I quit. You know what would burn that bozo's butt good? What? If you ran with your half of the business. I couldn't do that. I've listened to those brokers. They don't know anything you don't know. It would be fun to see the look on Sawyer's face if I became his partner. Maybe that's why your mom left it to you. Give it a shot. We'll talk on the way home. Home? I'll move in with you. Uh-uh. You can't live with me. Why not? 'Cause you're a horse. "'Cause I'm a horse," is that what you said? I knew this would come up eventually. You stay here with your family. Take care of Lou.

You want me to raise the buyout offer? No. All right, you win. I'll double the price. That's fair enough. Deal? I've got a lot of important business stuff to do. Freddy, you can't be a broker. Why not? Who in their right mind would give you their money? You'd be quite surprised. I would be friggin' amazed. I don't have time now. If I need you, I'll call. See you later, partner. Hello.

Hello, Mr. Chaney's office. Hmm. Curious. 7 1/2. 8. 8 1/2. Holy shit. Maybe we should buy some of this crap. Can't. Fred's cornered the market. Maybe we can get it someplace else. [Ring] [Ring] Yeah. Hello? Frank? Boyd Osborne here. Hey, Boyd-o babe! There's a new company on the exchange called indio oats. Oh, hey, you're not buying it, are you? I just got inside information that the f.D.A. Is going to freeze all sales... And launch a full investigation. You're kidding? Animals are dropping like bricks after eating the stuff. What a shame! Yeah. Avoid that shit like the plague. Thanks, frank. Owe you one. Sigma chi. Sigma chi. Hubba, hubba, hubba! Indio oats, indeed! Testing. Is this on? Ladies and gentlemen of wall street, it is both an honor and a privilege to receive the award of stockbroker of the year. I'd like to thank each one of you, but I don't have enough time, so thank you. I jammed his phone. This is locked. He'll never get out in time. That's occupied, pomeroy. Why don't you just use this one? This one, sir? ♪ A wop bop a loo bop ♪ ♪ a lam bam boom ♪♪ Mr. Chaney, you have an emergency call on 21. Mr. Chaney, you have an emergency call on 21. Hello. Oats contaminated. Took time to hit me. What are you talking about? Those indio oats. They're poison! Oh! If I hadn't taken 6 pounds of maalox, I'd be pushing up petunias in poughkeepsie, permanently. That means indio oats... They're worth squat. This horrible face on the wall isn't helping. This number is not working in this area code. Don! Don! Hello! Hello! Let me out of here! Let me out! Let me out! Aah! Ah! Aah! Ah! Aah! Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy--ohh! Live by the sword, die by the sword. Let's give him, oh, say, half an hour. That should be the end of indio oats. Ha ha ha! Could I show you the murcheson figures? Sure. Help! Help! Aah! Aah! Ohh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! [Peck peck] Get away from me, you diseased, winged, rotten bird! Look at Freddy's oats. How low can you go, indio oats? [Knocking on window] Open the window! Help! Help! Open the god damned window! Hi, Mr. Chaney. What are you doing out there? Open the window! Come back in here. You could hurt yourself. I brought you a tuna fish sandwich. Sandwiches? Aah! Which do you want, rye or whole wheat? Open the god damned window! What? Open the window! Rye or whole wheat? Rye! Rye! Open up the window! Really, Mr. Chaney! Open the window! Aah! Freddy? Problem? Little financial trouble? Maybe we should talk. Soon. Come on, Fred. You haven't lost everything. Hey, you still got me. Stay on your side of the road! We could hit the road together, like the, uh... Swengi brothers. I need some time alone, understand? Ha ha ha! Sure. Sure. No problem. Fred, what do you think you'll need? A couple minutes? Good luck, Fred! You'll always be my best friend! Maybe not my absolute very best friend, but certainly in the top 10. My 10th best friend. 15 would be the floor. Big promotion. New office, expense account, perks. I found out the geek was sinking his money into this rinky-dink outfit that was about to go under. Ha ha ha! Me and Sawyer didn't tell him about it. We locked him in the bathroom while his stock was crashing! Yeah, well, that's business. You little bastard. Allison! Oh, Allison, what do you care? Well, here's to Freddy. Good riddance. Good... Riddance. You son of a bitch. You set him up. Set who up? You and this ass-kissing idiot. What's she talking about? I'm talking about Fred, about the way you sold him down the river. Business is a tough world, Allison. He's right. You don't know how tough yet. I quit. Bad day at the office, dear? The pits. I'm talking to a horse? There's nobody else here. I feel terrible about Fred. Well, you should. Well, I'm sorry. Listen up, curly. Fred's a nice guy, and he likes you a lot. What are we going to do? Help him restore his self-confidence. How? He didn't have much before. If we enter a horse in the El Segundo stakes, and that horse wins, then Fred will get a load of money, and Sawyer will not. You see? Fred would get the load! That's a great idea, Don. Where do we find a thoroughbred? Ahem. Here's the beauty of my plan. You are looking at him. Something funny? Sorry. If I can pull this off, you both get rich. I get satin doll. You get a piece, I get a piece. Whoa! Happy ending! Don, I know you've got four legs, but-- hey, I'll worry about the winning. You worry about the driving, all right? And would you turn off this east Indian music? Don, you can't win a race! Why not? Give me one reason. Well, look at you. Give me another. Ah, forget it. I know I can't outrun those other horses. That's the way a horse race is normally won. No, no, no! Freddy, listen. Horses have hang-ups, just like people. Maybe I can psych them out. Some have envy of, ahem, you know what. Others have no self-esteem, just like someone else we know. Yeah, real funny. It's very simple, Fred. We'll invade their psyches, analyze their subconscious, we'll use Freud and jung, and stick it to them where the moon don't shine! Do you want a hamburger? Do you want a people burger? Have you talked to Mickey about this? I like it if they know this, if they've got it at least a week ahead. Wait a minute. Hmm. Didn't I see that nag on the front end of a milk truck-- was it last Thursday? Last Friday. Freddy, heard a stupid rumor you're entering a horse in the stakes. It's not a rumor. This the plug? Yeah, this is the horse. You're kidding? You're kidding? What's his name? Don. Don. Just Don. Sounds like a plumber. He doesn't need any pretentious names. His breeding, it's in his legs. Correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think you have a snowball's chance in hell of finishing the race on that piece of shit. Lick my nose. We're gonna win this race. Really? Want to make a little bet? I got nothing to bet. You can bet this turd. I couldn't bet my tur--horse. Chickenshit, huh? O.k., I'll bet this horse. Against what? What do you have to bet? Well, let's see, um... Can you break a 20? I'll bet my horse against your horse. Hey, now, that's ridiculous. Chickenshit? Who are you calling chickenshit? I'm calling you chickenshit. You're a chickenshit chickenshit. O.k., Freddy, I'll make the bet. My horse against your horse. All my horses against your horse! Sweetheart, you can't do that. You think i'm chickenshit? That's a bet. Including satin doll. Not my satin doll! Darling, don't be a chickenshit. You're on, Freddy. Is he getting more obnoxious? Me and my big mouth. What a revoltin' development this has turned out to be. Hot-cha-cha-cha. Let me tell you something, mister. I been riding horses all my life. I'm the man to ride this damn horse. Why do you say that, Mr. Um... Mr. Snake? One shot of this, he can win Indianapolis 500. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Eh! Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Marv? Marv? Marv! Great, Fred. He's perfect. Let me do the rest of the interviews, all right? [Don] What makes you the man to ride me-- I mean, to ride Don. Ha ha ha! 'Cause I know how to handle these animals. Well, what do you mean, Mike? Well... You got to be... Tough on 'em. You got to let 'em know who's... Boss. Some people think horses are wonderful animals. Let me tell you... They're the dumbest shits god ever put on the face of this earth! Hey, watch what you're saying, butthead. What did you call me? Nothing! I called you a butthead, butthead. What are you going to do, butthead? Come on, wimp, take a swing. I dare you. [Crash] Aah! You got a really big mouth! Are you trying to get me killed? Who's next, Fred? That's it. No one's next. That was the last available jockey. What are we going to do now? I'll think of something. Oh, no. What am I going to do? I'll never win this thing. God help me. [Bzz bzz] Quit sniveling. Everything will be fine. Well, that's easy for-- is that you, lord? No, you stupid son of a bitch. It's me. Dad, is that you? Of course it's me. So much for the glamour of reincarnation. Dad, you're a horsefly. Oh, I'm a horsefly! Oh, I didn't notice! That would explain the little wings, why I've been buzzing around piles of manure all day, and leaving little fly shit droppings wherever I go. Thank you for solving that mystery, Sherlock. I got a real problem. I don't stand a chance of beating those horses. Why not? They're all professional athletes. I've always been more of a couch potato. You can do it. You're a horse, just like they are. You all have hoofs. You all have legs. But their legs work! Son, you have something they don't have-- a big mouth. You can win this race! You really think so? Absolutely. You're absolutely right. I can win this race. Who's going to run this race? I am! Who's going to win it? I am! That's the spirit! No offense, but what's it like being a horsefly? It sucks. We're just a short time away from the start of the 75th El Segundo stakes. Lord Kensington is the 4-year-old champion, a favorite to win today's race. In the next stall, the long shot, number 8. This is Don-- Don? Bill, is that right? Just...don? Give me a break. Just forget about him, o.K.? Yeah, right. Right. It's normal to be nervous. Who's nervous? Breathe deeply. In through the nose... Out through the mouth. In through the nose... [Coughing] Ahem. [Ding] Whew! Uhh! He's got to be cheating. Jack, you better use that whole can. Uhh! What's this, some kind of joke? Uhh! Riders up! When you break through the gate, just try and stick to the rail. O.k., um... Stick to the rail. You riding that yourself? That's right. That figures. This ought to be good. By this time tomorrow, you ought to be dog meat. Ha ha ha! You look good, Fred. Thanks. Wait a minute! This horse and me, we're going out there, and we're going to beat the odds. 'Cause I'm going to get you back for everything you ever did to me and my family. Let me tell you something about the little guy. You can only push him around until you back him in the corner. Like the mighty Wolverine who gnaws his leg off if caught in a trap, I'm going to start gnawing my leg off. My name is no longer Fred p... What is my name? My name is Fred p. Wolverine chaney, because justice is finally going to be done. The little guy is finally going to whip your ass. Aah! The track's the other way. [Horn blows] I got it. [Bugle blows] Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, this is your track announcer. If he wins this race, I'll syndicate him for millions. Number 1 is heavy rains, from the long Meadow farms, and ridden by ernestine esposito. Number 2 is curiously, ridden by Dennis riday. Let him take an early lead before you make your move. Early lead? Make my move? We'll be lucky if we don't get lost. Good luck, you guys. Lord Kensington, from the Sawyer stable, [gasp] There he is! God, he's beautiful. Honey, Jesus! ...ridden by Shelly boyle. Number 8, out of pepperidge farm, and ridden by Fred p. Chaney, is...don? Don? Don? Don? Don? Don? The horses are at the post. There you go. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Ho, boy. Whoa! Lord Kensington is delaying the start. Come on, where's your big plan? I'm thinking. Get off my back. You know what I mean. Number 7! Number 7, over here! Look into my eyes. You look very tired to me, very sleepy... At the sound of the bell, you'll turn into a mushroom. [Snoring] You are drifting into a deep, deep sleep. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. The horses are in the gate. Here we go. [Snoring] Uhh! The flag is up... There they go! [Snoring] Heavy rains breaks on top, followed by curiously, never too early, and lord Kensington, and trailing by four horses...Don. Ohhh! Hey, look! I'm running! Pfft! Aah! Pfft! How are we doing? Are you blind? We're losing, come on! I got an idea. How about we trade places and I ride you? Hey, Pablo's pride, wait up! Pablo's pride, the immigration people are here. They're waiting at the finish line. They're checking green cards. Yeah. Iimmigracion! Iimmigracion! Greena carda! Ha ha ha! Greena carda! Ha ha ha! Ha ha! Yeahhhh! Pablo's pride has slowed. Now he's turning around. Pfft! Whoa! I'm warning you, Fred, stop kicking me! Hey, fellas, wait up! Wait up, will you? Move over. Oh, boy! What a beautiful day for a race, huh? Whoo! I'm telling you, you guys are doing terrific out here. Did you hear the news? The acme mucilage people are in the stands. They're buying all the winners. Mucilage. You know, glue. This is easier than I thought. Hey, Lindbergh, quit flapping your wings or we're going to take off. Come on, Don! Come on! Around the clubhouse turn, lord Kensington is coming up fast on the inside. He's making his move. ...heavy rains, he's taken the lead. And narrowing the gap is...Don. I think I just ate some poop. Whip his ass, Mickey. I think I can, I think I can. I thought I could, I thought I could... I haven't run a mile since high school. Ohh! I'm dying here. Yeah, me, too. Hey, lard ass, get that piece of shit outta my way! What did you say? You heard me. Get that piece of shit out of my way. That's not very polite. That's not even being a good sport. When you say something like that, I just want to rip your god damned arm off and feed it to that stupid horse! Now, get outta my way! Ha ha! That's tellin' 'em, Fred. Curiously is veering to the outside. He's pulling off! Hey, heavy rains! Here's a good one for you. What do you get when you got 12 donkeys on your front lawn? Fertilizer. Ha ha ha ha! Heavy rains is pulling up. But wait a minute. Here comes Pablo's pride in the wrong direction! You pygmy son of a bitch... He's going to do it! Of course. He's a champion. Fred, i-- I can't make it. Talk to me like that old guy in rocky. Do it for the American way of life. You can do better than that. O.k. Do this for your mom and dad. Yeah, right. For my mom and dad. I told you! I don't believe it! Turning for home is lord Kensington, but making up ground rapidly is Don! Don? Don? Don? What the hell is this? Into the home stretch, it's lord Kensington. But here comes Don! Woo woo woo woo! Do it for hot dogs! Do it for Mary Tyler Moore! This sentimental stuff just ain't working for me. Do it for satin doll! Yeah! Yeah, right! Keep talking! You win this thing, I'll have your teeth capped. Cosmetically bonded? Like a TV anchorperson? Yeah! The whole 9 yards! Now, come on! Go! Yee hah! Ohhhh! Yes! Yes! Come on, baby, go. What do you get when you have 20 donkeys on your lawn? He's going to do it! Come on! Move it, lord! Refugee from a glue factory! Get that piece of road kill out of my way! Hey, Kensington, you can't win this race. And you know why? Come on! Come on, baby. Huh? Do you know why? Yes! You stupid animal! Do you know why? Come on, mama! I'll tell you why. Because, uh... Because, uh... Because, uh... Do it! Come on! ♪ Because of the wonderful things I've done ♪ ♪ da doodley doodley doo ♪♪ Yes! Woo woo woo woo woo! Huh? Huh? Why, mother, I'm cured. Knyuk knyuk. Yes! I told you! Ladies and gentlemen, please hold all tickets. We have a photo finish. Let's get to the winner's circle. We don't know if we won. This is great! What's this? Those are the horse's front teeth. What? Give me that. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention? The result of the 7th race of the El Segundo stakes has been declared official. The winner, by an incisor, is Don! Ohh! We won! We won! You lost the race! You lost our horses! You lost my satin doll! Shut up! Let me think! I bet a hundred bucks on Don. I just won 20 grand. Congratulations, Osborne. You're fired. Fred, over here! Smile, please. Smile. How does it feel to win? Couple more, Fred. Freddy! Freddy, boy! Fred, son! You did it! Congratulations! You're not going to hold me to that silly bet now, are you, pal? Partner? Son? I think I am... Dad! Happy trails, Walter. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ohh! What awful breath! Must be the second worst smelling breath I've ever had in this office. Oh, that's good. I have horse saliva all over my hands. Keep the tongue still a second. What do you think of this, Mr. Horse? Oh, yeah! Yeah! Hey, thanks, doc! Now I'm perfect! Ha ha! O.k. No problem at all. If there's any irritation, rinse with salt water and put on a compress. I don't thi-- bee a ba Dee a ba Dee that's all folks! Ha ha ha ha ha! Captioning made possible by Warner Bros. Captioning performed by the national captioning institute, inc.
