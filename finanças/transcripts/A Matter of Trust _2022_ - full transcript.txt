'Trust is good, control is better.' Vladimir Lenin A MATTER OF TRUST Good morning. My name is Eva. I'm the doctor. Ali, interpreter. - Are you the doctor? - Yes. - Ihram's insulin. - Thank you. Stop him! Stop! Go left! Help him, dammit. - Stop. - Easy now. Calm down! - Get the ankle cuffs. - Calm down. - What's going on? - He's bleeding. Easy now. - What happened? Did he hit the floor? - No. - What's his name? - Ahmed. - Does he speak Danish? - It says so in his papers. Ahmed, I'm Eva, and I'm a doctor. I'd like to examine your mouth. My name is Eva. I'm a doctor and I have to check your mouth, okay? I need to be sure he understands what I'm saying. Ali? Tell him I'm a doctor and here to help him. She's a doctor and wants to help you. She wants to examine your mouth. I can't examine him if he doesn't open his mouth. - Open his mouth. - Open your mouth. - I don't wanna fight with you. - Open wide. Come on. - There is something in there. - A razor blade? No, no, don't swallow! Open your mouth! - Ahmed, look at me. - Was it a razor blade? Yes, I think so. Did he swallow it? He's breathing normally, so it passed his airways. Does he need to go to hospital? Eva, if you say we should cancel, we will. Keep an eye on him. I have to make a phone call. Keep him calm. This is Eva Vestergaard, medical consultant on a repatriation flight. I have a young man who may have swallowed a piece of a razor blade. Yes, I saw it. Not very big. He's breathing normally. I have eye contact with him. So you wouldn't have him transferred to a hospital? Okay. Thanks. Bye. - So? - It not dangerous. The blade is dulled by the gastric acid and cannot harm his organs. It looks dramatic, but it's not dangerous. Sure? Yes. We have a green light. - Good morning. - Welcome on board. Come on. Relax. Ahmed, it's easier if you co-operate. Relax. Relax. Breathe. Take a deep breath. Ladies and gentlemen, we are preparing the cabin for takeoff. We kindly ask you to fasten your seatbelt - - and put your seat back in an upright position. What's going on? What? You sent a picture - - of your dick. To Gustav. What are you talking about? He sent it to half the school. He made a bet with Arthur that he could make you do it. - What the hell were you thinking? - It wasn't me. I recognized your room in the background. The ugly pillow we made together. Good morning, 9a. You look perky. - Good morning. - Good morning. Okay, settle down. Let's all settle down. Thank you. You were to pick a passage in the book that made an impression on you. Did you all do that? - Yes. - Good. Let's hear some of them. Then we'll have a talk about why you picked them. Villads. - Me? - Yes. That Villads. What did you pick? - The passage with the dead body. - Yes? - Do I just read it out loud? - Yes, please. 'I drag my dead body through a sticky illusion of closeness, of a village.' 'The roads neatly embracing each other as engagements.' 'I can no longer think. The unbearable headache, the nausea - - that have settled in me in past months.' 'I am only here by necessity. It was the only option.' 'My slimy skeleton dragging itself up the country road on a dawning morning.' 'A heavy cloud ceiling rests above the town.' 'I mustn't fall asleep, I mustn't fall asleep.' Yes. Will you share with us why you picked that passage? I just thought it was kinda cool. You need to come up with a bit more than 'cool' at your Danish exam. Well, it's gross and kinda zombie-ish. Gross and zombie-ish. Yes, good. Anything else? Yes, let's hear from someone else. Emil. What do you have for us? Yes, Emil, what do you have for us? Settle down. Emil, what did you choose? - I didn't do the reading. - You did yesterday. That's just not okay. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Sit still. Sit still. Is there a problem? He kicked Thomsen's tray and spilt coffee all over him. - Is he okay? - Thomsen? Yes. Let me go check. - Thomsen, the doc's coming down. - Sure, she can come. - Would you give me a hand? - Nice and easy now. - May I? - Nice. That's really great. Take a deep breath and calm down. How are you doing, Ahmed? I believe you swallowed a piece of a razor blade. Am I right? You're bleeding, but it's not dangerous. It'll pass on its own in a few days. If you're scared or need to rest, I can give you a pill. Would you like that? You've used up a lot of your energy. It would be good if you could eat and drink a little. You're strong. You're gonna be okay. Relax. Relax! Don't worry. Nothing happened. I'm okay. - What happened? - He tried to head-butt her. Nothing happened. What... why ...? Why are they hitting him? Go back to your seat. I don't understand! - Ali. - Why are they hitting him? Easy, easy, easy. If you calm down and behave, we'll take it off. - Are you okay? - Yes, yes. I'm fine. Hang on. Why aren't you in school? I just forgot something. I'm back. How does she feel about that? Oh. That's just not okay. Oh, hang on. Emil? Oh, no! Come. Laura. Come see this. It's sea foam. When it's windy there are bubbles in the water. Around them little molecules of fat and proteins gather and it becomes foam. Pretty little hand. You got that from me. Dad says I look like him. That's what he says. I've missed you. So much. Come. Relax. Calm down now. Sit down and relax. - Come on. - Calm down. Easy now. - Wanna hear what I'm thinking? - What are you thinking? I don't understand them. We patch them up, give them therapy, and look after their children. Then when we say 'you can safely return to your country now, ' they won't go. I know things aren't easy in Afghanistan. But someone has to live there, and they're Afghan. If they can't make it work, then who the hell can? We've done a lot for them. Our soldiers have sacrificed their lives so their children can go to school - - and their women can gain dignity. We've poured billions into their country. But they don't wanna live there. We're at work. I'm glad you're here. Go easy on the water, sweetie. Can't we just buy some more? There are no shops around here. There's only beach and beach. When are we going back? Come on. We're on a trip. If we could drink that we could travel for days. We could go as far as we wanted. Imagine if we just did it. Are we allowed to do that? Where would we go? - To America, maybe? - Sure. Great idea. It's right out there. Aren't you gonna eat that? Sausage is your favourite. Not so much anymore. Then we'll give it to the Merman. Come. CASH ONLY - Emil. - Hi. What are you doing here? I'm just out walking. Where are you going? Need a ride? I'm on my way to a farm to pick up some chickens. I can drop you off on my way back. - Did you walk all the way from school? - Yes. That's like six miles or something like that. Wow. - What do you need chickens for? - For my garden. - For real? - Yes. For real. Did you know that they lay one egg a day? That's a lot of eggs in a week. What happened in class today? You didn't return. No. What was that business with Gustav and Arthur? Have you fallen out? Not really... But you also hang out with Frederikke, right? Yes. She's a sweet girl. What are your plans after secondary school? My parents think I should go to high school. What do you think? I just wanna get away from here. Are you having a hard time with your folks? Not... a hard time. It's just weird. We live in the same house. But I don't know how they're doing. And they don't know how I'm doing. They try so hard to appear happy and relaxed. But I can feel how worried they are. You know what I mean? - What was her name? - What? Her last name. Amber. Andersen. Amber Valentina Hernandez Andersen. Her mother was Chilean. Amber Valentina Hernandez Andersen. That name really doesn't fit someone who's dead. Sorry. Are you okay? It's just the nausea. I should've eaten something. As soon as it's over we'll find something to eat. Okay? Is that her husband and children? Maybe. Could be. I think she has two. So... Do you recognize anyone? It's been years. Yes. What do you want to do, my love? Shall we go in? - Shall I go with you? - I can handle it. It's fine. Ihram. Ihram. My name is Eva. I'm a doctor. I've lived in Denmark for eight years. I speak Danish. Sorry. My mistake. My name is Eva, and I'm a doctor. I'm here to help you with your insulin. Are you worried I'll take it all at once and croak? That would be kinda silly. Does it matter now that you send us away anyway? I'm not sending anyone anywhere. - Other people made that decision. - And you trust them? I trust that they're competent people - - who scrutinize a case before making their decision. Ihram, I'm here because it's part of the Hippocratic oath - - to offer medical assistance to those who need it regardless of the situation. Would it be better if I wasn't here? May I? You'll feel a little prick. Do you have children? Yes, I have a 17-year-old daughter. I just turned 18. Congratulations. So I'm an adult now. That's why they're sending me back. I've lived in Denmark since I was ten - - but they claim I've had my most 'formative' years in Afghanistan. And that that is where I belong. You have your whole life ahead of you. A lot can happen in your lifetime. Hey, Henrik! Stop that one, would you? Ah, yes... there! Yes, yes, yes, that's how it's done. There. Do you want it? No. Thanks. They take off in all directions. - You didn't slaughter mine, did you? - No, yours are in the stable. Come. - Was it hard to find? - Nah, I used the GPS. - Whose house is this? - Her name is Hanne. It's Airbnb. Do you find that problematic? Airbnb? I mean politically. - Would you like some wine? - Yes, please. Well then, cheers. Welcome. What do you think? It tastes... different. A good Riesling always gets a hint of petrol flavour as it matures. That's how you recognize the really good ones. But there are also notes of ripe fruit. Can you taste it? Once you've gotten through the initial and more penetrating notes. What's this now? Apricot? Peach... what? What? - Shall I find a condom? - No need. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Do what you did last time. - No, not that. - Oh. - Come. You aren't done yet. - Okay. Come. Take me. All the way in. Yes, like that. Oh my God, you're good. - You're so good. - It's better if you don't talk. Come on, harder. Like that, yeah. What the hell was that? I don't know. Come on, keep going. Yes... - Show me what you've got. Come on. - Shh. It's so good. You're so strong! Wait here. Hi. I'm Hanne. Owner of the house. - Ah. Adam. Hi. - I should hope so. - Hi, hi. - Hi, hi. - Hanne. - Hi, Hanne. Vîyan. - Anything I can do for you? - No. I just wanted to make sure everything was in order. - We're pleased enough. - Do you cook? - Not right now, no. - Will you be? - Yes, I can't rule it out. - Do you have induction at home? - No. - No. Then there are a few things you should know. Oh, it fell over. The burner only heats up when you place metal on it. Look. No heat in my hand. But here we go. Now it's getting hot down there. And when you lift it back up, it stops. - Okay? - I think we got it. So... anything else you'd like to know? No, I don't think so. Then just carry on enjoying each other's company. The house was built with that in mind. My husband and I bought it for our retirement years. The day after we got the key he collapsed. On the kitchen floor. Right there. - Dead on the spot. - Oh, my. - Yes, very sad. - Love should be treasured. It's like life's savings bank. Once you open the door ajar - - it all oozes out like that. Yes. If you need anything I'm right down the road in number 5. - That's good to know. - Alright, so enjoy. Yes... So that was Hanne. Did you come. No... no. Phew. I'm all exhausted from crying. - I'm Lotte. - Maja. - Yes, I'm pregnant. - Well, you look very slim otherwise. - Is it your first? - Yes. - A little ...? - Girl. Wonderful. I have two myself. The eldest went to school with Amber's eldest. That's how we know them. - How about you? - I didn't know her. It's Simon, my husband. Excuse me... He went to high school with Amber. I don't think they've talked for years. They just lost touch. Yes, that tends to happen with high school friendships. It's so meaningless. Being ripped away like that. Yes. I'm about to cry again. Where did your husband go? He's over there. Well, I'll make my way there now. - See you there. - Yes. Are you okay? - I'm glad we did this. - Of course. - Let's ditch the funeral gathering. - Okay. It's a horrible tradition anyway. It's up to you. - Do we say goodbye to anyone? - No, that's not necessary. - They already took off. - They who? The others from high school. Did you get a chance to talk to them? We just said hi. Ladies and gentlemen. We are approaching Kabul Airport. There, you look respectable again now. Very nice. - Is it dead? - Mm. That's too bad. - Come. I wanna show you something. - What? Just come. Come. Come on! Come! Feel this. No wind. Sit down. I have something for you. - What is it? - Stick out your hand. Here you go. - Is it amber? - Mm. Please leave the plane. Goodbye. Here you go. Go on. You must get off the plane. Throw him off the plane. - Stand up. - Stand up, man. Go on, get out. Do what I tell you. Don't you dare bring shame on me in front of everyone! - Hey, stop! - Sit down. Get him out! That's no good. We're under their jurisdiction. There's nothing we can do. Get him out! Mom? Mom! Mom! Hi, sweetie. Are you coming? I'll hold you, I promise. I talked to Dad. We agreed you could stay with me till tomorrow, perhaps even longer. - Doesn't that make you happy? - Where are we gonna sleep? In the cabin. What cabin? Auntie's. Don't you remember? We were there loads of times when you were little. Is it far? Nah, it's not too bad. He said to say hi and give you a kiss. Kiss you here and here and here. And here and here and here. How could it do that? With no head? - Run around? - Yes. - Why doesn't it die? - It does. But the body only uses the brain to start and stop motion. The muscles have their own memory. They do all the work. And when there's no more oxygen it collapses. You stink! You know?! Wanna see something beautiful? Okay. I'm starving. I'm sorry. We should've brought some food. You can't really bring a packed lunch to church, you know. Wait here. I feel like taking a swim. - But we didn't bring swimsuits. - It doesn't matter. We'll just swim without. And air-dry. Maja. - Hi. - I didn't notice you didn't have a car. I can give you a ride. Jump in. Hey... I don't really think we... Thank you. That's really nice of you. It's not something one can ask for. There. It should come just like this, like a godsend. It's constant. 'Don't push Ingvild, and don't speak to her in a harsh voice.' 'Ingvild needs fresh air, and Ingvild is having a bad day.' That sounds exhausting. It must be hard on you. You have no idea. We all work hard all the time - - but all we talk about is how hard it is for Ingvild. - Language creates reality. - Mm. - And you two, what do you do? - Maja's a writer. - And I make films. - An artistic couple. How exciting. Yes. Thanks for the ride, Lotte. - Why did you say that? - Say what? That I'm a writer. But you are. I work at a health shop. That's just how you make a living. And you teach at a continuation school. Yes, when I don't make films. Let's find something for you two to eat. Come. - Is everything okay? - Yes. I'd like to welcome you all. I'm happy so many came and to see that... Amber had so much love in her life. I won't give a speech, but feel free to say a few words if you like. There's a light spread. Please dig in. It's there for the taking. What a beautiful day. Entirely in Amber's spirit. Entirely in Amber's spirit. Help yourselves. I'll be right back. Seawater and lemon. - Go on. - Say it again. Eat your oyster. Chew on it. No, I don't like it. - But there's something... - Yeah, try another... - Do I have to? - Go on. Is it true what they say about oysters? I don't know. What do they say? You're a naughty one, aren't you. Come. Oh, yes! Show me what you got! Like that. Do it hard. - Shh. - You're so good. It's better if you don't talk. Ah, it's so good. Oh, yes. Harder. - Goddammit! - Never mind. Go on. Keep going. Come, come, come. Come on. Come, give me your milk. Goddammit! - Bomshi-bomshi. - Bomshi? - Did someone drop their car keys? - No. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Perhaps the young lady? - Come in, why don't you. Oh, yes. They're mine. I didn't even realize. They were in the driveway. I thought: Is there something there? Thank you. - You're drinking wine? - Yes, we are. And you drive in separate cars? - Yes, it was easier that way. - Easier? - Are you two even together? - Us? It just all seems a bit off. Fishy. That's quite an accusation. One wants to know whom one is dealing with when one rents out one's house. I read about someone who rented their house to someone who made porn films. One doesn't want to be a party to that. I can certainly understand that, Hanne. But you have nothing to worry about. Adam and I have been together for... 11 years? And with a fulltime job and three kids the magic can get lost, you know? So a couple of times a year we leave it all behind. Just the two of us. And after work on a Friday we meet somewhere - - like two complete strangers on a secret date. Then we have 24 hours of talking and drinking wine and... yes. Yes. Well, then I don't want to spoil the fun. - Enjoy your evening. - Thank you so much, Hanne. - Why did you do that? - Do what? Tell her such a long and detailed story about us. Because I sensed she needed one. - Yes, but still... - Come on, it worked. Yeah, sure. Hey! I know who you are. I think you should grab your boyfriend and get out of here. Simon shouldn't be here. He's not welcome. Have you seen Simon, my husband? Okay. Get lost! What's going on? - Did you get something to eat? - No, I was waiting for you. I met the red-haired woman in the bathroom. She said we should leave. Why would she say that? Simon, why did she say that? I'll tell you if you want to know. But I want you to consider why you want to know. Isn't it amazing? I always drive up here when everything is shit. It usually helps. I won't tell anyone. This one is something very special. You get all the way down to the rye notes. Can you taste it? I'm thirsty. At the cabin you can drink as much water as you want. And I'll make you something delicious. Can I help you? I don't have any money. Okay... I was just at a funeral. I left my purse. - Let's just say you can borrow it then. - Really? What would you like? A French hotdog, please. Something to drink? That'll be... 100 kroner. Who was buried? Someone my husband went to high school with. I never met her. Ketchup or French dressing? French. She slipped on some rocks... and tripped and hit her head. And then her children lost their mother. What they expected to be eternity has ceased to be... with the babbling suddenness of a summer sprinkle. Are you married? You said 'my husband.' Yes. We got married three weeks ago in my in-laws' allotment garden. It rained all day. When the ceremony was over the entire lawn was flooded. People were totally soaked. There was no place to go. I had to bite my cheek to stop myself from crying. My mother-in-law said that even the rain had come to celebrate us. It was a very nice way to put it, I think. He's seven years older than me, Simon. When I was 11, he graduated high school. And now we're having a baby. Can't we just call Dad and ask him to come get us? - I can't walk anymore. - Come on, Laura. - He can take us there. - No, we can't do that. - Why not? - My phone's dead. Are you sure? - Are you completely sure? - Stop it, Laura! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Did I ever tell you about the time you swallowed a bee? We were living in the house we lived in when you were little. You toddled around on your stocky little legs playing on the lawn. Suddenly you started crying hysterically. You cried and cried. Then your lips started turning blue. You couldn't breathe. You wheezed with every breath. So we called an ambulance. Dad was in a state of panic. So I ran into the house, grabbed a knife and stuck it in. There. What happened then? You started breathing. I'd read about it in a book. I didn't know if it would work. But when the ambulance finally got there the doctor said - - that you would've been dead if I hadn't done it. You'd swallowed a bee. It stung your throat. Come. Jump up on my back. Here we go. What did you say at home? - That I'm at a course. - And he doesn't suspect anything? He's in Barcelona with some friends. I said I was out giving a talk. I do it all the time, so there's nothing odd about that. Besides, my wife isn't the jealous type. It's part of what attracted me to her. About... 22 years ago. Time changes a lot of things. I've never done this before. I want you to know that. Why did you approach me at the conference? I'd seen you at the buffet. - You'd seen me? - Yes. Why were you there anyway? You're not a real estate agent. I gave a talk. Don't you remember? No, I ditched it. Ah. So what was it about, your talk? Stop. That was the name of the talk. It was about... how we, as human beings - - need to be better at finding meaning in existence... where we are, instead of telling ourselves - - that happiness is just around the corner if you work more and harder. Constantly optimizing - - expanding... Instead, we should stop for a minute... and find meaning. I just need to find the key. There's usually a key... Where do we usually put... the key? Wait here. It's probably in the shed. Shall I take your trash? Yes. There's plenty of food. We won't lack for anything. We should get the furnace going. Mom, you're bleeding. Oh, yeah. I must've cut myself on something out in the shed. It's just a small scratch. I just wanna call Dad and say goodnight. We'll do that later. He'll just worry if we call him now. You know what he's like. You know it wasn't on purpose, what happened back then, right? It wasn't. Let's get something to eat. You can come now. Come. Come! I can't goddamn believe it! Listen, Hanne. We've borrowed your cabin until tomorrow. We won't steal or break anything, and we're not making porn. You need to leave us alone, okay? - You're very active on Facebook. - What? - Where are you going? - I found you online. I saw the pictures, and the lady in the pictures sure isn't this one. I can't really find anything on you. Probably because you're such a little sneak. Will you please leave? Lying speaks volumes about someone's character. Listen... Adam. Adam! What are you doing here? Where are the kids? - At home. - You just left them? Should I have brought them here, perhaps? My sister's with them, so don't paint this as if I'm the irresponsible one. - So who's she? - Vîyan. I'm Hanne, and she's Vîyan. So you meet up with my husband in some stranger's cabin and have sex or ...? I'm sorry. - For how long? - It's just this once. - We met at a conference... - I never meant to hurt anyone. Oh, okay. I should leave and give you a chance to talk. - Are you in love with him? - No. - Vîyan has a husband. - I wasn't asking you. So, you're cheating, too? No. - Now I'm confused. - Yes... - There is no husband. - Say what? You said you had a husband, and that your sex life was terrible. You couldn't stop thinking about me. And now there's no husband? It... I'm not out to steal your husband. He's really not my type and... And well... we're not that great a match sexually either. If you're not in love, and the sex is bad, what the hell are you doing here? - I'd like to know that myself. - I'm kinda curious, too. Good genes. Holy crap! - I'm sorry, I don't follow. - She wants your baby, Adam. No... No. You said you had it under control. I asked you, didn't I? And you answered. And that means we have an agreement. I really never meant to upset anyone. I'm sorry. You can't fucking do that! We had an agreement! You can't just change it... and then ...! People gotta be able to trust one another, goddammit! Ladies and gentlemen. The crew will now prepare for landing. Please make sure your seats and tray tables... I was afraid you'd taken off. Is it over? Yes. It's just the staff there now. They're cleaning. Maja... Back when I knew Amber... in high school... - I... - I don't want to know. I want to be able to love you - - for who you are now. Emil? Where have you been? - Just out. - Gustav came by. He said he couldn't reach you. Right... Sweetie... What's going on? - See you. - Yeah, see you. - See you next time. - Yeah. - I hope you get some sleep tonight. - Yes. - Drive safely. - You too, Eva. Your bath is ready. Are you coming? It's nice and warm. - Hi, Mom. - Hi, sweetie. Welcome home. There she is! We saved some dinner for you. - Would you like a glass? - Welcome home.
