Now, this is exactly the type of performance you would expect to see at the international Championship of Collegiate A Cappella. Am I right, Gail? John, you're so right, everything else seems wrong. Boy, these Barden University Treblemakers always thrill the judges. And the ladies in the room cannot get enough. So true, John. Nothing makes a woman feel more like a girl than a man who sings like a boy. Chloe, look at you. You're a mess. You're unfocused. You're unreliable. And your breath smells like egg. Like, all the time. I can't believe the Bellas are being passed on to you two slut bags after we graduate. Just don't eff up your solo. I won't disappoint you. My dad always says, "if you're not here to win," "get the hell out of Kuwait." Has your dad ever told you to shut up? I'm fine. Ouch! Boy, that hurt. Sexy man-splits. His pain is our gain, Gail. All right, good luck, guys! Good luck out there! Seriously, you girls are awesome... ly horrible. I hate you. Kill yourselves. Girl power! Sisters before misters! All right, ladies, it's now or never. Hands in! One, two... Up now, the Barden Bellas! Well, the Bellas tonight are making history as the first ever all-female group to advance to the ICCA finals. That's right, John. Now, why do you think it's taken so long for an all-lady group to break through that a cappella glass ceiling? Well, Gail, the women, typically, cannot hit the low notes, which really round out an arrangement, thrill the judges, and that can really hurt them in competition. Women are about as good at a cappella as they are at being doctors. One, two, three, four. Is it me or did we just take a left turn into Snoozeville? Yeah, and we parked in a lot where they do not validate. No! Holy... This is a surprise! This has never happened! Now, this is how you bring some excitement to the international Championship of Collegiate A Cappella. She had a week's worth of lunch and lost it. Well, she didn't lose it. We know exactly where it is. It's all over the third row. No, no... I got it. Thanks. Hi there! Welcome to Barden University. What dorm? Baker Hall, I think. Okay. So, what you're gonna do is you're gonna go down this way, you're gonna take a right and you go through those double doors... Your campus map. And your official BU rape whistle. Don't blow it unless it's actually happening. Hey. You must be Kimmy Jin. I'm Beca. No English? Yes English? Just tell me where you're at with English. There he is. I'm Benji. You must be Jesse. And you must be kidding. Wow! Looking at it now, I can see that it's a bit much. I can take it down. No, no way. I mean, it took a second for my eyes to adjust, but I can roll with this. Look, just so you know, I'm not a total nerd. I also happen to be super into close-up magic. Dude, that's awesome! How long was that little guy in there? Several days. Hey, this is campus police. Hide your wine coolers. Just... it's your old man making a funny. Chris Rock, everybody. Hey, you must be Beca's roommate. I'm Dr. Mitchell, Beca's dad. I teach Comparative Literature here. So, when did you get here? How did you get here? Took a cab. Didn't wanna inconvenience you and Sheila. How is the stepmonster? She is fine, thank you for asking. She's actually in Vegas at a conference... No, Dad, I don't actually care. L just wanted to say "stepmonster." So, have you guys been out on the quad yet? In the springtime, all the students study on the grass. I don't wanna study on the grass, Dad. I need to move to LA and get a job at a record label and start paying my dues. Here we go again. You know, Beca, DJing is not a profession, it's a hobby. Unless you're Rick Dees or someone awesome. That's not... l... I wanna produce music. I wanna make music, Dad. But you're going to get a college education first. For free, I might add. End of story. I'm going to the Activities Fair. Me, too. I'm going to the Activities Fair with my super-good friend, Kimmy Jin. Taking names, taking numbers. Join our righteous frat. If you ain't pledging Sigma Beta, you ain't worth no crap. That's a double negative. That's a lot of negatives. Follow me. There's only one group on this campus worth joining. As far as Barden goes, that's what being a man's all about. The Treblemakers. The rock stars of a cappella, the messiahs of Barden. Well, you know, not including athletes, frat guys, or actual cool people. Organized nerd singing. This is great. Yeah, it makes so much sense. How's your voice? Nice. I will stop at nothing to take those ding-a-lings down. Hey, Barb. You gonna audition this year? We have openings. Now that you've puked your way to the bottom, you might actually consider me? I auditioned for you three times and never got in because you said my boobs look like baloney. The word's out. Bellas is the laughing stock of a cappella. Good luck auditioning this year. Douche-b's. My God. This is a travesty. God, if we can't even recruit Baloney Barb, then we can't get anybody. Just take the dramatics down a notch, okay? Hi, do you wanna... Well, you're the one who got us into this hot mess. We'll be fine. I am confident that we will find eight super-hot girls with bikini-ready bodies who can harmonize and have perfect pitch. Okay? Hi, would you like to be a member of... Just keep flyering. We have tradition to uphold. How about we just get good singers? What? Good singers? What? Hi. Can you sing? Yeah. Can you read music? Yeah. Can you match pitch? Try me. Yeah. That was a really good start. I'm the best singer in Tasmania. With teeth. Love it. What's your name? Fat Amy. Um... You call yourself Fat Amy? Yeah, so twig bitches like you don't do it behind my back. I will see you in auditions, Fat Amy. I can sing but I'm also good at modern dance, olden dance, and mermaid dancing, which is a little different. You usually start on the ground. Ooh. It's a lot of floor work. I see that. Yeah, DJs. Deaf Jews. Shalom! That's not a real word but keep trying. You will get there. Not a lot of Jewish people where you're from? No. I did do Fiddler on the Roof, though, in high school. It was, like, me and some Aboriginals. It was really Jewish. It was full-on Jew. Hey, guys. All right, I'll give you my number. What about her? I don't know. She looks a little too alternative for us. Hi, any interest in joining our a cappella group? Right, this is, like, a thing now. Totes. We sing covers of songs but we do it without any instruments. It's all from our mouths. Yikes. There's four groups on campus. The Bellas. That's us. We're the tits. The BU Harmonics. They sing a lot of Madonna. The High Notes. They're not particularly motivated. And then there's... So, are you interested? Sorry, it just, it's pretty lame. A-ca-scuse me? Synchronized lady dancing to a Mariah Carey chart topper is not lame. We sing all over the world and we compete in national championships. On purpose? We played the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, you bitch! What Aubrey means to say is that we are a close-knit, talented group of ladies whose dream is to return to the national finals at Lincoln Center this year. Help us turn our dreams into a reality? Sorry, I don't even sing, but it was really nice to meet you guys. What are we gonna do? When you came in and you were just strumming the guitar, and it was, like, totally off-key, I wanted to choke you! Bumper. I wanted to choke you out! Okay, I'm gonna go introduce myself. Everybody be cool. It's just a normal day. Hi. Hi. Benjamin Applebaum. I saw you guys perform at a Mall of America like three years ago. Totally changed my life. I have not stopped thinking about you since. Thank you. Yeah. And, Bumper, huge fan. Your arrangement of Lovin' Spoonful's Do You Believe in Magic inspired me to become a certified illusionist. Wow. The smell of your weird is actually affecting my vocal cords, so I'm gonna need you to scoot. Skedaddle. But why don't we just exchange emails, and then totally hang out right now, together? No. Hard pass. Hard pass. What a nerd alert. Okay, guys, now let's match pitch. Too far. You think? Yeah. Should I have done another trick? No, I think your trick was fine. I just think the talking was a little weird. Maybe you can try to Facebook message him. Hey, I'm Beca. Over there. Thanks. Ninety-five point seven, WBUJ, music for the independent mind. Hey. Hi. Have you been standing there long? No. No, I just got here, I wasn't just standing here. Freshmen aren't allowed in the booth. Sorry. I'm Luke. Station manager. You must be Becky the intern? Lt's... Hey, man, what's up? I'm Jesse. I'm Luke. You're late. Hey. I know you. No, you don't. Yeah, I do. He doesn't. Totally know her. Okay, cool. Well, you guys can figure it out while you're stacking CDs. When you're done, there's more. Now, you guys will be spending a lot of down time together, so please, just no sex on the desk. I've been burned before. I do know you. I sang to you. L remember because you were in a taxi. Wait, is your dad a taxi driver? No. This sucks. I wanted to play music. Not me. I'm here for one reason only. I really love stacking CDs. So, what's your deal? You one of those girls who's all dark and mysterious, then she takes off her glasses and that amazingly scary ear spike and you realize that, you know, she was beautiful the whole time. I don't wear glasses. Then you're halfway there. Beca. Beca, wake up. Funny, this doesn't look like your lntro to Philosophy class. I'm posing an important philosophical question. If I don't actually go to that class, will it still suck? Look, honey. College is... it's great. You get to create memories here, I see it every day. You just have to give it a chance. You've been here, what, a month now? Do you have any friends? Kimmy Jin is my friend. No. You gotta get out there, Bec. You gotta try something. I got a job at the radio station. Great, that place. Yeah, it's dark and dirty and has like, what, those three weirdos who work there? Well, four now. You gotta try something new, Bec. Join one club on campus. And if, at the end of a year, you still don't wanna be here, you still wanna go off to LA and be P. Diddy, well, then, you can quit college. And I will help you move to LA. Seriously? Yes, seriously. But I really need to see it, Beca. This is college. Join in. You can sing! Dude! How high does your belt go? My what? My God! You have to audition for the Bellas. I can't concentrate on anything you're saying until you cover your junk. Just consider it. One time, we sang backup for Prince. His butt is so tiny that I can hold it with, like, one hand. Oops! Seriously. I am nude. You were singing Titanium, right? You know David Guetta? Have I been living under a rock? Yeah. That song is my jam. My lady-jam. That's nice. It is. That song really builds. Gross. Can you sing it for me? Dude, no. Get out! Not for that reason. I'm not leaving here till you sing. So... Yeah. I'm pretty confident about all this. You should be. Still need to shower. You have a lovely voice. Thanks. Yeah. See you at auditions! For your audition, each of you will be singing sixteen bars of Kelly Clarkson's Since You've Been Gone. If a group likes you, they will contact you directly. My tone-deaf sidekick Justin here will be collecting your information. If I could sing a lick, in any human way possible, I would, but I can't. And I hate myself every day because of it! I know. But if you think this is just some high school club, where you can sing and dance your way through any big social issue, or confused sexuality, you have come to the wrong place. There is none of that here. That's high school. This shit is real life! Now, don't just bring it, sing it. And let's do this. Hey, Bellas, remember when you tried to play in the big leagues and you choked? That should really be a lesson to everyone. If you sing the same boring, girly shit every year, you will blow chunks. All over the place. Vomit everywhere. My fellow a-ca-people. We will not let egotistical, big-headed, garbage dirtballs, whoever you may be, get in our way. I promise you, we will return to the lCCAs and finish what we started last year. And here's the first one up. Good luck. Whenever you're ready, dude. Yeah, hi, my name is Cynthia Rose. Not a dude. It's not a dude. There's no backup dancers? Okay. Hello. My name is Lilly Onakuramara. I have gills like a fish. I'm sorry. What was that? Hello. My name is Lilly Onakuramara. I was born with gills like a fish. One, two, three, four. Hi, everybody, my name is Stacie. My hobbies include cuticle care and the E! Network. It's high. Jesus. Thank you. Performing live gives me such a rush. Crushed it. Okay. That is everybody. I'm really not that impressed this year, guys. Wait, there's one more. Hi. Hello. Um... I didn't know we had to prepare that song. That's okay. Sing anything you want. May I? Wow. The sopranos. Jessica, Mary Elise, Lilly. The mezzos. Cynthia Rose, Stacie, Kori. And our altos. Fat Amy, Denise, Ashley, and Beca. We shall begin by drinking the blood of the sisters that came before you. Dude, no. Don't worry, it's Boone's Farm. Well, well, well, look who's in treble. Classic pun. I know. No Benji? Now, if you'll place your scarves in your right hand. L, sing your name... I... promise to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of a Bella woman. Promise to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of a Bella woman. And I solemnly promise to never have sexual relations with a Treblemaker or may my vocal cords be ripped out by wolves. And I solemnly promise to never have sexual relations with a Treblemaker or may my vocal cords be ripped out by wolves. You are all Bellas now. We did it. I want some more of this. Did we? Ladies, welcome to a-ca-initiation night. Prepare to soften the beach. I don't know what I'm doing here. Just living the dream. I still can't believe they let my sexy fat ass in. Beca! Beca! Wow. Be-caw! Be-caw. Do my eyes deceive me or are you a Barden Bella? No. You're one of those a cappella girls, I'm one of those a cappella boys, and we're gonna have a-ca-children. It's inevitable. You're really drunk right now. I don't think you're gonna remember any of this. No. I'm not drunk at all, you're just blurry. You okay? Yeah? Yeah. You almost fell over? No, she didn't. You know, I could... Can you pass a sobriety test right now? Yep. Can you stand up straight? See how I come right back? And I come right back. Right. Wow. Can I get you a drink? It sounds great. I'm gonna get you a drink. Go for it. I think you need to get on this level. Please be careful. Hi. I am so glad that I met you. I think that we're gonna be really fast friends. Yeah. Well, you saw me naked, so... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, ladies. Gather around. Ready for a show. Come on, baby bubble, wait in line. Yep. Yeah. You want some of this. I know you do. Nice. Mmm-Bumper and Donald. Getting it. You know, so there's like 10 of us. Mmm... That means that one of us is probably a lesbian. You think? Which one do you think it is? My money's on Black Beauty. So, when I drink too much tonight, can I count on you to hold my hair back if I puke? Don't tell her I said that. All right. I'm gonna go get a drink. This ginger needs her jiggle juice. See you later. Make good choices. I thought of a new name for this hairstyle. It's called the Orthodox Jew ponytail. Yeah? 'Cause it's very reserved at the front... l see that. But party in the back. I see these happening here. Here's the real question. Who would be easier to sleep with? Captain America or a great white shark? Great white shark. I wouldn't... Hey. What are you turd burgers talking about? Dressing for comfort? You are probably the grossest human being I've ever seen. Well, you're no panty-dropper yourself. So I have a feeling that we should kiss. And is that feeling a good feeling or an incorrect feeling? Well, I sometimes have a feeling I can do crystal meth, but then I think, "Better not." Yeah. I don't know the words, but I can... Thank you. This is awesome. It's definitely something. We are the kings of campus! Man, the old Bellas was hot! Yeah, they kept it tight. Okay. Sopranos in the front and altos in the back. As you can see, Kori is not here. Last night she was Treble-boned. She has been disinvited from the Bellas. That oath was serious? Dixie Chicks serious. You can fool around with whoever you want to, just not a Treble. That's not gonna be easy. He's a hunter. You call it a dude? Stacie, the Trebles don't respect us, and if we let them penetrate us, Not a good enough reason to use the word "penetrate." So, does anyone here have anything to confess? It was an accident. I... Turn in your scarf and go. Slut. Take your chair. Was that necessary? This is war, Beca, and it is my job to make sure that my soldiers are prepped at go time with three kick-ass songs sung and choreographed to perfection. And there are only four months until regionals. So, if you have a problem with the way that I run the Bellas, then you should just... Don't stress, Aubrey. Relax. We don't want a repeat of what happened last year. What happened last year? What are you saying? What happened last year? And do you guys wanna see a dead body? Click on "Guy Pukes on Cat." Enough! It happened. It's over. We will practice every day for at least two hours, seven days a week. And I trust you will add your own cardio. Why cardio? Yeah, no, don't put me down for cardio. Okay, moving on. This is a list of all of the songs that we have ever performed. And you will notice that we only do songs made famous by women. There's nothing from this century on here. Because we don't stray from tradition. Now, this is how we will become champions. Come on, girls! Let's go! Go, go, go! Pick up your knees! Faster, faster! One, two, one, two, one, two! Knees up, knees up! Go, go! Go! Let's get it. Yes, Chloe. Nice. Amy! What are you doing? I'm doing horizontal running. Horizontal running? No. No, no. No. I know... I can do it. Five, six, seven, eight. Okay, I'm calling it. Thank God. I asked to go to the bathroom three hours ago. Nothing. I hear nothing. Hey, Aubrey. Did we just learn the same choreography from that video? Okay. Don't forget to pick up your performance schedules. We have a gig next week. That's right. Next week. You guys, it's the Sigma Beta Theta's Annual Fall Mixer. Okay. Hands in, Bellas. Hands in, a-ca-bitches! Okay. Sing "" on three... No, no, no. It's actually on three, Fat Amy. All right. On three. One, two... Okay, we will work on that first thing next time. Okay, guys. Thank you. Goodbye. She has man hands. Beca, a word? What's up? You know you'll have to take those ear monstrosities out for the Fall Mixer. You really don't like me, do you? I don't like your attitude. You don't even know me. I know you have a toner for Jesse. A what? A toner. A musical boner. I saw it at Hood Night. It's distracting. Yeah, that's not a thing and you're not the boss of me. So... You took an oath. That oath cost you two girls already today. I'm pretty sure you need me more than I need you. I can see your toner through those jeans. That's my dick. Everything okay? We better have our shit together for SBT. I'm not worried. I think we're gonna be a-ca-awesome. This makes my beer taste bad. I'm gonna stop this. Whoa, whoa. Just stop. Stop. I am so sorry, Howie. I know we're not performance ready. I wanted the hot Bellas, not this barnyard explosion. I'm not paying for this. Let's go. Come on. God. Well, I hope you all remember the way you feel right now, so you will never wanna feel this way again. Chloe, your voice didn't sound Aguilerian at all. Chloe, for serious, what is wrong with you? I have nodes. What? My God. I found out this morning. What are nodes? Vocal nodules. The rubbing together of your vocal cords at above-average rates without proper lubrication. They sit on your windpipe and they crush your dreams. Isn't that painful? Why would you keep performing? Because I love to sing. Yeah, it's like when my lady doctor told me not to have sex for six weeks, and I did it anyway. You should really listen to your doctor. The key is early diagnosis. I am living with nodes. But I am a survivor. I just have to pull back. Because I am limited. Because I have nodes. Chloe, this is horrible. Well, at least it's not herpes. Or do you have that as well? Jesse? Yeah. I'm starving, so could you... You want me to get you lunch? You should probably lay off the burgers. You're not gonna be 22 forever, you know. Yeah, I think I'm good. He's good. You're good. And the chess match continues. Hey, this is my new mix, so if there's anything you wanted to play... Yeah, okay, I'll put it on the pile. Okay. What's up, weirdo? Okay. What's this? As much as I love spending time with you stacking CDs... And I do. I love it, like, more than life. I figured we could do some other fun things that don't make us wanna kill ourselves, right? Yeah. So, brought some movies. Jaws, E.T., The Breakfast Club, Star Wars and Rocky. Best scored and soundtracked movies of all time. That's what I wanna do when I grow up. I wanna score movies. Bring people to tears, you know. Blow their minds. I feel like only music can do that. Yeah. You must really sweep your girlfriend off her feet. I don't have a girlfriend. What? No. You have juice pouches and Rocky. Okay, so what do you wanna watch first? Wanna do something else? We could relive my parents' divorce. Or visit a gynecologist. What, do you not like movies or something? Like, any movies? You don't... What the hell is wrong with you? How do you not like movies? Not liking movies is like not liking puppies. They're fine. I just get bored and never make it to the end. The endings are the best part. They're predictable. Like, the guy gets the girl, and that kid sees dead people and Darth Vader is Luke's father. Okay, right, so you just happened to guess the biggest cinematic reveal in history? "Vader" in German means father. His name is literally "Darth Father." Huh. So, you know German. Well, now I know why you don't like fun things. You know, you need a movie education. You need a movie-cation. And I'm gonna give it to you. Yeah, in between Bella rehearsals, which are always. Are you guys getting ready for the riff-off? What the hell is a riff-off? Hit it! Welcome to the riff-off! Who's ready to get vocal? The winners get the greatest prize of all. I'm taking you down. - The microphone used by Hoobastank... - I don't care. When they rocked out at the Schnee Performing Arts Center. Let's see our first category. Ladies of the '80s. Mickey, you're So fine you're so fine You blow my mind. Hey, Mickey Hey, Mickey Mickey, you're so fine... You're so fine and you're mine I'll be yours till the end of time. 'Cause you made me feel. Yeah, you made me feel. So shiny and new. Like a virgin. Okay, guys. Touched for the very first time. Like the one in me That's okay. Let's see how you do it Put up your dukes, let's get down to it! Hit me with your best shot. Why don't you hit me with your best shot. Hit me with your best shot. Fire away. It must have been love. But it's over now. But it's over right now. The negative side effects of medical marijuana, folks. You are... Cut off! Stoney baloney. Let's check out our next category. So, we just pick any song that works? Yeah, any song. And you just go with it? Nice. And our next category is... Songs about sex. Sex? Na na na Come on. Na na na na na Come on, come on, come on. 'Cause I may be bad But I'm perfectly good at it. Sex in the air, I don't care I love the smell of it. Sticks and stones May break my bones. But chains and whips Excite me. 'Cause I may be bad But I'm perfectly good at it. Sex, baby Let's talk about you and me. Let's talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be. Let's talk about sex. Let's talk about sex A little bit, a little bit. Let's talk about sex, baby. Baby, all through the night I'll make love to you Like you want me to. And I guess it's just the woman in you. That brings out the man in me I know I can't help myself. You're all in the world to me. It feels like the first time. It feels like the very first time. It feels like the first time it's going down, fade to Blackstreet The homies got RB, collab' creations. Bump like acne, no doubt I put it down, never slouch. As long as my credit can vouch a dog couldn't catch me straight up. Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves attracting honeys like a magnet. Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent. Still moving this flavor With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy. The original rump shakers. Keep going. Shorty get down, good Lord. Baby got 'em open all over town. Strictly biz, she don't play around. Cover much ground, got game by the pound. Getting paid is her forte. Each and every day, true player way I can't get her out of my mind. Okay. I think about the girl all the time I like the way you work it no diggity I got to bag it up, baby I like the way you work it No diggity I got to bag it up, baby I like the way you work it No diggity I got to bag it up, baby I like the way you work it No diggity I got to bag it up, baby I like the way you work it No diggity I got to bag it up, baby I like the way you work it No diggity I got to bag it up We out I mean, you're welcome. It's a tough blow, ladies. The word you needed to match was "it." And you sang, "it's." You are... Cut off! Are you serious? The Trebles win! Beca, I'm sorry. You lost. I've never heard that rule! Ladies, ladies, come on. Come back. Sorry. Money in the bank. Enjoy watching us win the lCCAs. On the TV. On a regional cable affiliate. Before everybody goes to bed tonight, I need you to make a list of everything you did wrong. I'm gonna melt that Cabbage Patch Kid. Hey, guys, what we just did was great, right? Calm your pits, Beca. We still lost. Yeah, but it was spontaneous. It was awesome. We were actually listening to... Okay, everybody, hands in. "" On my count. On three or after three? On three. After three. One, two, three. That's not how we do it. Why can't we figure this out? So, I just find songs that have the same chord progressions and create a track that blends them together. So, like, this is the new bass line, and this is matching up downbeats. I'm talking really loud. That's me singing. This is really good. Now I'm the one yelling, right? That is amazing, Beca. Thanks. So, I brought this over, because I wanna watch you watch the end of this movie. And then I can die a hero. Wait, actually... You have a habit of making yourself at home, did you know that? Yeah. Okay. The Breakfast Club. 1985. Greatest ending to any movie ever. This song launched Simple Minds in the US. Could have been a Billy ldol song, but he turned it down. Idiot. Perfectly sums up the movie. It's equally beautiful and sad. That is fascinating. Right? Tell me, what does Judd Nelson eat for breakfast? Well, like all misunderstood rebels, he feeds on hypocrisy. Sure. And black coffee to help with his morning dumps. You're an idiot. It's true. I'm full of fun facts. You should let other people tell you they're fun. And an athlete. And a basket case. A princess. And a criminal. Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club. You're missing the ending. Sorry. It's good. I'm sure the beginning is... The white girl is back. And I'm out. Always a pleasure, Kimmy Jin. So... Excuse me. Excuse me. I should have taken that cardio tip more seriously. How much have you done? You just saw it. Chloe, you gotta be able to hit that last note. I can't. It's impossible. And it's because of my, my nodes. Her nodes. Her nodes. Well, if you can't do it, then someone else needs to solo. I think Beca should take my solo. Yeah, Beca would be excellent. But also, someone else might be equally as excellent. It's true. And they might be shy and not wanna come forward and say they wanted a solo. Well, Beca doesn't want a solo, so... I would be happy to do it if I got to pick a new song and do an arrangement. Well, that's not how we run things here. Aubrey, maybe Beca has a point. Maybe we could try something new. A-ca-scuse me? You can sing Turn the Beat Around and that's the last I wanna hear of this. That song is tired. We're not gonna win with it. If we pull samples from different genres and layer them together, we could make some... Okay, let me explain something to you because you still don't seem to get it. Our goal is to get back to the finals and these songs will get us there. So, excuse me if I don't take advice from some alt-girl with her mad lib beats, because she's never even been in competition. Have I made myself clear? Crystal. I won't solo. Fine. Fat Amy? Yes, sir? You'll solo. Yes! Yes. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. The 2012 southeastern regional competition has officially begun. Yes, I'm Gail Abernathy McCadd, and to my right is fellow a cappella alum John Smith and we are live from Carolina University. It's a new season for a cappella. The regionals begin the long road to Lincoln Center where all of these youngsters hope to one day win a trophy by making music with their mouths. A cappella out of sock puppets? Genius. Yeah, look at the black one with the white sock. It's making a statement. There's no craft there. Watching them will make you worse. At least they're different. And the Sockappellas, once again proving that it doesn't get better for everyone after high school. Do we clap? No, we don't. Never. Hands in. Remember, "" on three. One, two... Wait, you said we'd... I'm sorry. It's okay, it's gonna be okay. Okay. Let's give it up for the Barden Bellas! Wow. This does not look like the fresh-faced nubile Bellas that we have come to know. Is it me or are those skirts just not working anymore? You're walking the line, John. It's a nice surprise to see the Bellas mixing it up. It's refreshing, yet displeasing to the eye. One, two, three, four. The Barden Bellas bringing back the same song they sang at last year's finals. And all eyes will be on senior Aubrey Posen. She could toss some cookies at any moment. And she makes it through, folks. No cookie toss. John, a change of pace could not come soon enough here for the Barden Bellas. This is not a great way to start their season. Yeah, this number is like an elephant dart to the public's face. Yeah! Yes. Yeah, Fat Amy. Boo! The Barden Bellas went deep into the archive for that song, John. I remember singing it with my own a cappella group. And what group was that, Gail? The Minstrel Cycles, John. Well, that's an unfortunate name. Thank you. Really incredible. The Barden Bellas. Thank you. That was great. Amazing. You know, there must be something in the water over there at Barden University, 'cause this next group is also from Barden. Ladies and gentlemen, the Barden University Treblemakers. Here we go, the Barden Treblemakers. They're on the trail for Lincoln Center, huh? Absolutely, they always are, Gail. My favorite, and everyone's favorite. Now it says here in my notes that their front man Bumper Allen has recently released his own line of sports sandals. Shh! Boy, the bad boys of a cappella have just gotten badder. Whoo! That's right, John. I'm gonna have to excuse myself to freshen up the downtown. Can I help? Ladies and gentlemen, the moment we've all been waiting for. The results of tonight's regional competition. In third place, the Sockappellas! Yeah, lucky you. In second place, and advancing to this year's semi-finals, the Barden Bellas. Yeah. Yes! Awesome. Nice. Nice. Hey, And the winner of tonight's regional competition, defending their crown, ladies and gentlemen, the Barden University Treblemakers! Way to go, Trebles. Yes! Yes! That's right! I'm willing to sign breasts. Yes! I'm willing to sign... Look who it is. Old dudes. Get a life. Sonic boom. Just 'cause we graduated a few years ago, doesn't mean we can't still get off performing our oral magic, all right? Oral magic? Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy, buddy. Are you looking for what I think you're looking for? Yeah, a fight? You looking for a fight? Please, please. Please say you're looking for a fight. Please, please say you're looking for a fight. Yes! I will fight. I would fight him, but I tore a quad within the midst of the dance... Hey, Gandhi. Hey, you, are we doing this or what? Hit me. What? Let's get it on! Mmm-mmm. I've wrestled crocodiles and dingoes simultaneously. Come here! Why do you want me to hit you? I don't wanna do that. I need to feel something. Hit me as hard as you can. Hit me hard. Take this. Take this. I want you to hit me with it. I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna check on them. The kraken has been unleashed. Feel the Fat Amy force! Hey. My God. My gosh. That's fantastic! Amy, don't. Amy! Feel the fat power. Fat Amy! Kick me in the balls! Amy! Give me the sharp weapon, I wanna put it up his butt! Ooh! Cherry on top. Which way are you running? This way. This way. All right. Beautiful. Amy! Vertical running. I'm vertical running. Hey, Hilary Swank from Million Dollar Baby. Hey, you know you just have to say, "Hey, Million Dollar Baby." You don't have to reference the specific actress. Damn. Prison changed you. Thanks for bailing me out. Well, I didn't. You called my dad? I know, I know, but they were putting you in handcuffs, Bec. It looked pretty serious. That doesn't mean you call my dad. Who else was I gonna call? Okay, why are you yelling at me? I'm the only one here. I didn't ask you to be. I was just trying to help you. I don't need your help, you're not my boyfriend. Got it. Dad, it's not a big deal. Yeah, it's a big deal. I get a call in the middle of the night saying my daughter's been arrested for destruction of property. It was a misunderstanding and I was protecting my friends. I was putting myself out there. Making memories. If you think I'm paying for you to go to LA after a stunt like this, I'm not. Get in the car. You're not even gonna hear what I have to say about this? No, not tonight. Just get in. Hey! What up, Shawshank? Did you get yourself a bitch? Did they spray you with a hose? I did a turn at County. You guys waited up for me? Of course we waited up for you. They've been here for hours. It's a real inconvenience, Beca. Beca, I'm glad you're here. I'm calling an emergency Bella meeting. No. First up... Yes. Our score sheet revealed that the Sockappellas almost beat us. And Fat Amy, you need to do it exactly how we rehearsed it, okay? No surprises. We should be taking risks. It's not enough to be good, we need to put ourselves out there, be different. Beca's right. The Trebles never sing the same song twice. The audience love the Trebles, they tolerate us. We could change the face of a cappella if we... My God, that sounded so queerballs. What's happening to me? Let me show you this arrangement I've been working on. I didn't know you were into this stuff. Yeah. Okay, I have the pitch pipe, and I say that we focus on the set list as planned. From now on, there will be no more wasting time with work or school or boyfriends or partners. Sorry, Cynthia Rose. But Aubrey, this stuff is pretty cool. I mean... Okay. Rehearsal tomorrow, 8:00 a.m. sharp. Hey! This is my track! You're playing my song right now! That is awesome! You like it? You put it on the radio! That is amazing! It's a sick beat. Yeah, I always thought her beats were pretty sick. Hey, Becky, listen, spring break, I want you to take the night shift. Play your music. The DJ at the Garage does a brilliant version of this, but yours? It's better. Yeah, it is. I'm gonna listen to her tonight. I think you should... You should come with. I have a thing. Flight attendant training? It's Barden Bellas. I have the semi-finals tonight. Really? I did not have you pegged as an a cappella girl. That's 'cause you don't know Becky like I do. See you tonight. Okay, don't you flat-butts worry, I got this. I'm just gonna pump and dump. I don't care what you say. Sisqó live, best performance ever, I've ever seen. "Thong Song" isn't his only hit. Yeah. All right? That's serious. Yo, Bump, is that Fat Amy? Donald, slow down! Slow down! Yeah! All right! Hey, Amy? Sabotage! I've been shot. I've just been shot! Help me. Fat Amy! They shot Amy! I've got you. I've got you. No, no, no. I'm talking, I'm talking... I'm sitting up. - All right. Cool. - There's no need for that. No mouth to mouth. Shit. Bumper threw a big-ass burrito at me. I'm gonna kill him, I swear. I'm gonna finish him like a cheesecake. You've got yourself a little something there. Just leave it. It fuels my hate fire. My God. It's a... it's... What the hell? Um... it's pretty cool, actually. L think we're just running out of gas. No, that can't be. You just filled the tank. Yeah, I did. And, yet, maybe I didn't, because I got hit by flying Mexican food. And we're out. A-ca-scuse me? A-ca-believe it. Man, what are we gonna do? Maybe we could call... No, don't even say it, Chloe. How dare you? No, actually that is a really good idea. I've got Bumper's number. Why do you have Bumper's number? So, Bellas, what boring, estrogen-filled set have you prepared for us this evening? Excuse me? But you guys are gonna get pitch-slapped so hard your man boobs are gonna concave. Nine miles, guys. That's pretty good. I set fires to feel joy. That's adorable. Five minutes, Bellas. Where did he come from? Shh! It's over. There's no way we can beat the Footnotes and the Trebles. Whoo! That little peanut can sing. He really can. It sounds to me, though, Gail, like his boys haven't dropped yet, if you know what I mean. If you mean his testicles, then I do, John. I do. I really do. A-ca-huddle, now. The top two teams go to the finals, so we just have to beat one of them. And if we do it exactly how we rehearsed it, we will get there, okay? Exactly. Hands in. On three or after three? Screw it. Let's just do it. Put your hands together for the Barden Bellas! Okay, the Bellas are coming out. Another step in this competition and... One, two, three, four... Here we go again. Looks like they're sticking with what they know. A little tension on the stage tonight. Claws are out. This is just friendly collegiate fun. It's a tough competition, but we're all here to have a good time. That's right, John. But a mistake can haunt you for the rest of your life and affect your children. What the hell, Beca? Were you trying to screw us up? Are you serious? Newsflash. This isn't the Beca show. Okay, I'm sorry that I messed you up, but in case you hadn't noticed, everybody pretty much dozed off during our set. It's not your job to decide what we do and when we do it. Why don't you ask the rest of the group how they felt about your little improvisation? Amy? It was cool. But it did take us a little bit by surprise. Yeah, a lot by surprise. A little. I told you she wasn't a Bella. Aubrey, don't. No, that's okay. You don't have to pretend you're allowed to have a say in the group, right? Your attitude sucks. You're a grade-A pain in my ass, and I know you're hooking up with Jesse. Whoa. Whoa. Aubrey, calm down. We're not hooking up, I swear. Jesus Christ! That's perfect. Of course you're here right now. I don't need your help, okay? Can you back off? Trebles. Time to bring the pain. If this is what I get for trying... Beca? Beca, wait. Aubrey, it actually went really well. Chloe, stop! Excuse me. My God. Okay. Beca? Beca, wait. And the Treblemakers seal the deal tonight. Unfortunately, Barden's other group, the Bellas, do not advance, and senior Aubrey Posen loses her chance to redeem herself from last year's Pukegate. Happy spring break. Thanks. In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain. And an athlete. And a basket case. A princess. And a criminal. Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club. My God. Okay. We are from the Collegiate A Cappella Association. It has come to our attention that you are not in college. Ls this your mother? This is Aubrey Posen. Yes, thank you, sir. I look forward to seeing you again at Lincoln Center. Yes! Aubrey? I'm all in, bitches. Okay. The a-ca-gods have looked down on us and they have given us a second chance. Shalom! I texted Beca. You did what? She makes us better. That's not an opinion for you to have, Chloe. Why? Because it's not yours? You're not always right, you know. We will win without her. - Jesse, I know you're in there. - I can smell popcorn. Jesse, come on. Open up. Hey. I tried to call you. L left you a bunch of messages. Yeah, I got them. I'm sorry that we fought. I was mad and I overreacted and I'm just... Aubrey makes me crazy. Seriously? You think I'm mad because you yelled at me? No, I know... No, you don't. You think you know, but you don't. You push away anyone who could possibly care about you. Why is that? I don't know. Well, you better figure it out because I'm done with... Whatever this is. Jesse... I'm done. Women. Yeah. Okay, stop. What is happening to us? Chloe, you sound like you smoke three packs a day. Stacie, you are so behind on choreography. And Jessica and Ashley, it is like you haven't been here all year long. Aubrey, really? We've literally been here the whole time. Aubrey, please, just give us a break. It's kind of not the same without everyone here. We need Beca. Maybe if Aubrey loosened the reins a little bit. Okay, shut it, Chloe! Whoa! I'm sorry. That was rude. Chloe, could you please get your head out of your ass? It's not a hat. A-ca-awkward. Again. No one was more surprised than me, but I really liked those girls. And you thought quitting was the answer? Seriously? You can say that to me? Come on, Bec, that's so unfair. Look, your mom and I, we didn't work. But I tried so hard to make things right between us. But you, you just shut me out. Yeah, well, I shut everybody out. Don't take it personally. It's just easier. It's also really lonely. What do I do? Well, that's up to you. Trebles, listen up! If this is about the Bellas getting into the finals, we already know. I don't give a crap about those dumb bitches. Because I'm being brought up to the musical big leagues. What are you talking about? John Mayer just asked me, personally, through an assistant, to sing backup on his new CD. I leave for Los Angeles in a few hours, so I gotta get going. But Bumper, what about the lCCAs? They're this weekend. Sorry, buddies, but I won that shit like 100 times, so I'm out of here. Got a collarless leather jacket to buy. Maybe some aviators. I might get an earring, I don't know. It's Los Angeles. This is exciting stuff. My life rules! Bumper's a jerk. All right, I said it. Yeah. Well, he's a jerk that we need to replace. Yeah. Pronto dente. You know he writes his own fan mail. Spot opened up, and it's yours if you want it. Just one condition. Promise me you won't get all weird. We're just a group of guys singing a bunch of covers of songs, okay? If you get weird, they will definitely not let you stay. Deal. Although I don't know what you mean by weird. Got it. I have been there for you for so many years, and all you do is treat me like... All right, no, okay, just shut up! Everyone! Come on, I joined this group so I could hang out with a bunch of really cool chicks. And also 'cause I was really sick of all my boyfriends and I need to get away from that. But this is some serious horseshit. What's that smell? Stinks everywhere. I don't wanna be like the old Bellas. Yeah, I wanna be how we are now. Me, too. We should have listened to Beca. So it's my fault? That's not what I'm saying. No, no, no, that's what you're all thinking, isn't it? That I'm the jerk. I am the girl obsessed with winning. Aubrey, you're too controlling and it's gonna ruin all of us. You know what, I can lose control if I want to. I can let go. This time I'm not gonna choke it down. Come on, bring it! You can do better than that! That's all you got? Enough! Enough! We could have been champions! Give me the pitch pipe, you bitch! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Never! I'll protect you. I'll protect you. Hands off the goodies! Move, you bitches! Guys! Guys, stop! What is going on? Nothing. Nothing. This is a Bellas rehearsal. I know. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. What I did was a really dick move and I shouldn't have changed the set without asking you guys. And I definitely shouldn't have left. I let you guys down and I'm really sorry. And... Aubrey, if you would have me, I want back in. Aubrey. Wait. Thank you. That would have been embarrassing. Beca, I know that I've been hard on you, okay? I know that I have been hard on everyone here. But I am my father's daughter. And he always said, "if at first you don't succeed", "pack your bags." Jesus. That's really crazy. I get it. Mine gets on me, too. Not like that, but... I guess we don't really know that much about each other. About most of you, really. Well, I'll confess something that none of you know about me. I have a lot of sex. Yeah, we know, Stacie. Only 'cause I just told you. This is a good idea. That was a pretty bad example, but this is a good idea. Why don't we all go around the room, and we can all say something about ourselves that nobody else knows. Okay, I got something. This is hard for me to admit to you guys. I think we all know where this is going. Let's be honest. Well, for the last two years, I've had a serious gambling problem. What? What? It started when I broke up with my girlfriend. Whoomp! There it is. I still love you. Anyone else? I ate my twin in the womb. What? Okay. Fat Amy? I'm an open book. I mean, for God's sake, you guys all call me Fat Amy. See, I guess I'm just not really living if I'm not being 100% honest. And my real name is Fat Patricia. What? Okay. I've never been one of those girls who had a lot of friends who were girls. And I do now. And that's pretty cool. So, that's me. Someone else please go. Okay. Over spring break, I made the courageous decision to remove my nodes. I know. The doctor said that I can't sing above a G-sharp, maybe ever. I thought the season was over. It's okay. It's okay. Beca, what do we do? I'm sorry. Maybe not here. All right. Let's remix this business. Aubrey, would you pick a song for us, please? Bruno Mars, Just The Way You Are. Okay. Chloe, are you okay to take the lead? Yeah. Hands in. One, two... What was that? I don't know, I've never made that sound before. Yo, but with your messed up vocal cords, you could hit the bass notes. Do you know what that means? Yes, Lilly? I think I have something that can help us out. Excuse me, bitch, you don't need to shout. Okay, don't get mouthy. Welcome to the finals of the 2012 international Championship of Collegiate A Cappella. Lincoln Center is proud to welcome back all of these young hopefuls tonight who are hoping to win a trophy by making music with their mouths. This is gonna be a big night, and I tell you, Gail, if you can just shut your eyes. I'm doing it. Shut your eyes and get rid of all the a-ca-politics, then you can remember that being at Lincoln Center, in the Big Apple, and singing on this storied stage is the dream of every a cappella singer. You said it, John. The University of Virginia Hullabahoos, ladies and gentlemen. There they are. One, two, three, swag! Welcome back to the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella. This next group, they need no introduction, but I'll do it anyway! Hey. Good luck. Thanks. You, too. The Barden University Treblemakers! The Trebles closing it strong like always. Absolutely tight. It's gonna be very hard to beat that tonight. Every other group has their work cut out for them, John. I'm glad it's not us anymore, Gail. Those days are over, thank goodness. Especially since they wouldn't have us back. All right. How about that? The Barden University Treblemakers. I love you, awesome nerds. Yeah, you guys are the best. Even though some of you are pretty thin, I think that you all have fat hearts, and that's what matters. Okay, let's just smash this. Okay? Ladies and gentlemen, the Barden Bellas! My goodness gracious. Will you look at this? Gone are those Bella uniforms and this is a whole new look for them, and it is hot, hot, hot. John, these girls could turn me. We love you, Bellas! One, two, three, four. Way to go, Beca! What a show! I think we have just seen some a cappella history being made, John. And from an all-female group, Gail. I could never have called this one. Never. Well, you are a misogynist at heart, so there's no way you would have bet on these girls to win. Absolutely. Weren't they incredible? Wow! Ladies and gentlemen, let's give it up again for the Barden Bellas! Told you. Endings are the best part. You're such a weirdo. Listen up, a-ca-ballers. I have been rejected by the Army, shoved into a Dora the Explorer backpack, and pushed into the girls' locker room wearing nothing but suspenders. But no matter. I am in the world that I love. And with the assistance of my boy, Justin... My liege. I launch this year's auditions. Belly roll. The most recent ICCA national champion winners get to pick the audition song. All right, nerds. Let's go with... Because I have nodes. Chloe, don't worry, it's just God punishing you 'cause you're a ginger.-> 01:24:02,500 Ini Los Angeles. Menarik. Hidupku indah! Bumper brengsek. Aku mengatakannya./ Ya. Dia seorang brengsek yang harus kita ganti./ Ya. Secepatnya. Kau tahu dia menulis sendiri fan mail-nya. Ada tempat kosong, dan itu milikmu jika kau mau. Hanya satu syarat. Berjanjilah kau tak akan berperilaku aneh. Kami hanya kelompok dari orang-orang yang menyanyikan sekelompok lagu, paham? Jika kau bertingkah aneh, mereka pasti tidak akan membiarkanmu tetap. Setuhu, Meskipun aku tak tahu apa yang kau maksud dengan aneh. Aku mengerti. Aku sudah lama ada di sisimu, dan yang kau lakukan memperlakukanku seperti ... Cukup! Hentikan, semuanya! Aku bergabung dengan kelompok ini agar aku bisa bergaul dengan sekelompok gadis keren. Dan juga karena aku muak dengan semua pacarku.. Dan aku harus menjauhi itu semua. Tapi ini omong kosong. Bau apa itu? Bau di mana-mana. Aku tak mau seperti Bella lama. Ya, aku mau jadi diri kita sekarang. Aku juga. Kita harus mendengarkan Beca. Jadi ini salahku? Itu bukan maksudku. Tidak, Kalian semua berpikir begitu, 'kan? Aku brengsek. Aku gadis terobsesi dengan menang. Aubrey, kau terlalu mengontrol dan itu akan mengacaukan kita semua. Kau tahu apa, Aku bisa kehilangan kendali jika aku mau. Aku bisa melepasnya, Kali ini aku tak akan menelannya. Ayo, keluarkan semuanya! Kau bisa melakukannya lebih dari itu! Hanya itu kemampuanmu? Cukup! Kita seharusnya jadi juara! Berikan aku lencananya, jalang! Berikan padaku! Berikan padaku! Tidak akan pernah! Aku akan melindungimu. Lepaskan! Awas, kalian jalang! Semuanya! Semuanya, hentikan! Apa yang terjadi? Tak ada. Ini hanya latihan Bella. Aku tahu. Aku hanya... Ingin mengatakan bahwa aku minta maaf. Apa yang kulakukan memang bodoh... Dan aku seharusnya tak mengubah set tanpa izin. Dan seharusnya aku tak pergi. Aku mengecewakan kalian, Aku benar-benar menyesal. Dan... Aubrey, jika kau mengizinkan, aku ingin kembali masuk. Aubrey. Tunggu. Terima kasih. Itu akan sangat memalukan. Beca, aku tahu kalau aku keras padamu. Aku tahu kalau aku keras pada semua orang di sini. Tapi aku putri Ayahku. Dan dia selalu berkata, "Jika Kau tak berhasil..." Berkemaslah... Astaga, benar-benar gila. Aku mengerti, Ayahku juga mengatakan itu. Bukan seperti itu, tapi... Kurasa karena memang kita tak saling mengenal satu sama lain. Tentang sebagian besar dari kalian, sungguh. Aku akan mengaku sesuatu yang kalian tak tahu tentangku. Aku sering melakukan seks. Ya, kami tahu, Stacie. Hanya karena aku mengatakannya. Ini ide yang baik. Itu contoh yang buruk, tapi ini ide yang bagus. Kenapa kita tidak berkumpul... Dan kita bisa mengatakan sesuatu tentang diri kita yang tak di ketahui orang lain. Aku punya sesuatu. Ini sulit bagiku untuk mengakuinya pada kalian. Kurasa aku tahu kemana arahnya, Mari kita jujur. Dalam dua tahun terakhir, aku memiliki... Masalah judi yang serius. Apa?/ Apa? Dimulai setelah aku putus dengan pacar wanitaku. Itu dia. Aku masih mencintaimu. Ada yang lain? Aku memakan kembaranku saat dalam rahim. Apa? Baiklah. Amy Gemuk? Aku buku yang terbuka. Maksudku, demi Tuhan, kalian memanggilku Amy Gemuk. Lihat, kurasa aku tak benar-benar hidup jika tak menjadi 100% jujur. Dan nama asliku adalah Patricia Gemuk. Apa? Baiklah. Aku belum pernah menjadi gadis... Yang memiliki banyak teman wanita. Dan sekarang aku punya. Dan itu mengasyikan. Jadi, itulah aku. Silahkan yang lain maju. Baiklah. Selama liburan musim semi, aku membuat keputusan untuk menangkat nodeku. Aku tahu. Dokter bilang, Aku tak bisa menyanyi di atas G-tajam... Mungkin selamanya. Kupikir sesi ini berakhir. Tak apa-apa. Tak apa-apa. Beca, apa yang akan kita lakukan? Maafkan aku. Mungkin tidak di sini. Baiklah. Mari kita coba remix bisnis ini. Aubrey, mau memilih lagu untuk kita? Bruno Mars, Just The Way Are. Baiklah. Chloe, Kau siap memimpin? Ya. Matanya, Membuat bintang terlihat seperti tak bersinar Rambutnya, rambutnya Jatuh sempurna tanpa ia mencobanya Dia begitu cantik Dan aku mengatakan padanya setiap hari Aku berpikir tentang dia, tentang aku, tentang kita Membuka mataku, itu hanya mimpi Dia tak melihat apa yang kulihat Tapi tiap kali dia bertanya padaku, ''Apa aku terlihat cantik?'' Itu hanya mimpi Saat aku melihat wajahmu / Jadi aku melakukan perjalanan kembali ke jalan itu Apa dia akan kembali? Tidak ada yang tahu Aku menyadari itu hanya mimpi Tidak ada apa-apa yang berubah Karena kau menakjubkan Apa adanya / Itu hanya mimpi Saat aku melihat wajahmu / Jadi aku melakukan perjalanan kembali ke jalan itu Apa dia akan kembali? Tidak ada yang tahu Aku menyadari itu hanya mimpi Tidak ada apa-apa yang akan berubah Karena kau menakjubkan Apa adanya Itu hanya mimpi Saat aku melihat wajahmu Wajah Tangan di dalam. Satu, dua... Apa itu? Entah, aku tak pernah membuat suara seperti itu sebelumnya. Tapi dengan mengacaukan pita suaramu, Kau bisa membuat nada bass. Kau tahu apa artinya? Ya, Lilly? Kupikir aku punya sesuatu yang akan membantu kita. Permisi, jalang, Kau tidak perlu berteriak. Baiklah, jangan berpanjang lidah. Selamat datang di final... Kejuaraan lnternational Antar Kampus Acappella 2012... Lincoln Center dengan bangga menyambut kembali semua kandidat muda... yang berharap menang piala dengan membuat musik dengan mulut mereka. Ini akan menjadi malam yang hebat, dan akan kuberitahu, Gail... Jika kau bisa menutup matamu./ Aku melakukannya. Tutup matamu dan singkirkan semua politik... Maka kau akan ingat, berada di Lincoln Centre, di New York... Dan bernyanyi di tingkat panggung ini adalah impian setiap penyanyi acapella. Benar sekali, John. Ini penghitungan akhir FINAL Universitas Hullabahoos Virginia, tuan dan nyonya. Itu mereka. Satu, dua, tiga, swag! Selamat datang kembali ke Kejuaraan Internasional Acappella antar kampus. Kelompok berikutnya, tak perlu diperkenalkan lagi, tapi aku akan tetap melakukannya! Semoga berhasil. Terima kasih. Kau juga. Universitas Barden, Treblemakers! Aku hidup untuk akhir pekan Tapi tidak, tidak lagi Karena di sini ada perasaan terkenal soal hari jumat Ya, aku mencari beberapa aksi Dan itu di luar sana Kau bisa merasakan listriknya Semuanya di udara malam Dan itu mungkin sama Tapi kadang-kadang kau ingin pergi Dimana semua orang tahu namamu Jadi kurasa aku harus menunggu dan melihat Tapi aku hanya akan membiarkan sesuatu baru terjadi padaku Dan tidak apa-apa Tidak apa-apa Tidak apa-apa Hari begitu cerah Lampu terag dan kota besar Malam ini milik kami Aku punya sihir dalam diriku Semua yang kusentuh menjadi emas Sekarang semua orang tahu Aku punya sihir dalam diriku Saat aku memukul lantai Gadis-gadis datang padaku Sekarang semua orang ingin beberapa presto sihir Ini trik yang aku akan membuat pikiranmu bingung Pilihlah barisnya, aku akan menghipnotismu dengan setiap baris Aku butuh sukarelawan Bagaimana denganmu, yang dengan mata?
