[Harmonica] Hey, what did the blue jay say To the little sparrow on the fence one day Say, you'll never guess, so I Will tell you what I overheard while passing by The blue jay said " How do you do Mr. Sparrow, how are you" The sparrow said " How do I do I do just as I please" and then away he flew Hey, what did the blue jay say To the little sparrow as he flew away Say, nobody ever heard Because he didn't get a chance to say a word The blue jay didn't notice That on the fence there was a cat The sparrow flew but the blue jay sat And now he's just a little bird on Nellie's hat - [Music Stops] - [Applause, Cheering] Hey, hey! Beautiful, beautiful! That performance touched my heart! I, for one, will contribute a dollar. Er, gentlemen? Yes. That's... fine. [Girl] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Come on, fellas! Help! Help! Help! I got robbed! 've been robbed! Help! - 've been robbed! Help! Help! - The professor's at it again. Come on, fellas. We gotta meet the professor. Not me. The rest of youse kids can wind up in jail, but not me. We're not going to jail. We're going to Washington Square. - What's the matter? What's up? - It's the professor. - He's picked a pocket again. - You take that back! You can't inflect on my grandfather like that! - Take it back! - All right. You don't think the professor would take anything that didn't belong to him? That's just the trouble with the professor! He don't seem to know what belongs to him and what doesn't. The professor's one of the "honestest" men in the world. And, besides, he's reformed. Ah, my pupils. [Chuckles] - Professor! - Yes, what is it, my little tuberose? Tell them you didn't take anything from that man. What do you mean, steal? Why, who suggested such a thing? - [Together] We did! - Oh, you did. Well, now I ask you, is this gratitude... after all I've done for you boys? - I'm ashamed of you. - You see? Yes. As a matter of fact, I just learned of a big party uptown... where, if we hurry, we can pick up a penny or two playing for the guests. Come along. [Chuckles] - Come on. - Well, maybe he is honest, but if it happens again... [Chattering] Come on, boys. Sit down! Skinny, would you please sit over here? Cunning, aren't they? Especially the little one. Tsk! The hats! Can't you see you're in a swell house? Wouldn't it be amusing to have them play at our wedding reception? We could dress them up and... Allen, you're not listening. Huh? Oh, our wedding. Yes, yes. Of course. - Allen. - What? Never mind. - Come on, boys. Tune up. - [Harmonicas Tuning] Stop sniffling like that. Here, use this. - [Grumbling] - [Chuckling] A sad thing to say at best. Thoroughly disapprove of it. - [Grumbling Continues] - Stop mumbling, Jasper. I can't understand your nephew bringing these filthy little street Arabs here. They'd steal your hoops if they could get their hands on them. I'll thank you not to get personal, Jasper. He was a dandy Yes, he was a dandy He was a dandy and she was a belle She wore a bonnet with blue ribbons on it And he wore a flower in His coat lapel He was so handsome And she was oh, so fair While strolling on the avenue Folks would stop and stare For he was a dandy Yes, he was a dandy He was a dandy and she was a belle She wore a bonnet with a stuffed tomato on it And he wore a flower in His coat lapel [Woman Screaming] [Confused Chattering] We've been robbed. All our furs, everything. A burglar's been in and has stolen everything! - What did I tell ya? He's done it again. - He did not. - I know he didn't! - Just the same, I'm through! Come on. He did not! He did not! - [Man Shouting] Police! Police! - [Chattering Continues] Police! Police! [Grunting] I'm caught! - Somebody broke in the window. - What? I haven't any doubt these ragamuffins are part of the scheme, sent here to divert our attention from the thief. - Will you stop mumbling? - They've caught one of them. - Leave me alone. I didn't do anything. - We'll take you right in. - I don't know nothing about it. - We caught this one in the balustrade. I trust you weren't injured in the struggle. - Why, no, ma'am... not a scratch. - [Scoffs] Come here, dear. Don't be afraid. You and Jasper... take these gallant officers upstairs... and get a description of the things that were taken. Give my apologies to my guests and assure them I will replace everything. - But doesn't this one go to jail? - Oh, don't be an idiot. Come, dear. I didn't do anything. Honest, I didn't. - I'm too little. - [Chuckles] Are you? - Won't you let me go? - Where would you go? - Home. - Where's home? - With the professor. - The professor? - Who's the professor? - Oh, don't you know him? Why, everybody knows the professor. He's a fine gentleman and an "aristocrack." Oh. - Is that cake? - Suppose you find out. Help yourself, my dear. - Hey, Professor, wait a minute! - What is it? Professor, they got her! The police. They got her! - They got who? They got Dimples? - Yes, sir! Oh, uh... Here, uh... Say, the professor's awful strict with his students. He watches 'em very close so they won't do nothing bad. And he scolds them if they're naughty. But singing and playing in the street? Isn't it rather odd... for a music teacher to permit that? Aw, that's just practice. If they practice at home, the neighbors throw bottles through the windows. [Laughing] Which do you like best, chocolate or vanilla? I like chocolate and vanilla. I wish the professor was here. He likes vanilla cake. Help! Stop thief! Help! Stop thief! [Professor Groaning] Oh, he got away. The thief got away. - Are you hurt, sir? - [Coughing] Oh, he was a big fellow. Too big for me. I'm not as young as I once was. - What's going on down there? - This gentleman almost caught the thief. - He got nearly everything back. - Wonderful! Won't you come in, sir? I'd like to see you. Oh, thank you, madam. I'd be delighted. Well, I did no more than my duty as a citizen. [Coughing] Ah, and not unlike the home of my childhood. [Chuckles] Dimples, my darling. - You're all right. - I knew you'd come. - It's the professor. - Ah, delighted. Do you see? If anything's been stolen, always send for the professor... and, generally, you can get it back. [Chuckles] Uh, yeah. Well, I wouldn't go as far as to say that. You've rendered me a valuable service, sir. I can't thank you enough. Oh, madam. I, uh, I was passing... in front of your, uh... cottage... when the culprit emerged from the bushes. I seized him and grappled with him, but he was young and I am not the Eustace Appleby that I was... when I stroked the Yale crew to victory. If it wouldn't embarrass you, I'd like you to accept a little something. Oh, no, no, madam. Thank you. Not for me. Any American would have done the same. But, of course, if you'd like to, uh, remember the child with a little something... - Oh, no. - Eh, no. Just a little souvenir. $100 or... [Clears Throat] Perhaps 75. Is there anything you'd especially like, dear? Well, there is one thing. - Yes. - What is it, dear? If it's not too much, I'd like another little piece of that chocolate cake. - Of course, child! - Oh, dear. How big a piece do you want? A big piece or a real big piece? Give her all the cake and some of the cookies. [Clock Cuckooing] [Woman] Here you are, dear. Now tell me, where do you live? - In the rookery, in Cherry Street. - [Woman] The rookery? Just sort of camping out... the Depression, you know. [Chuckling] Oh, yes. Good night, my dear. - Will you come and see me again, soon? - Yes, ma'am. I'd like to. Do you always have chocolate cake? I will, whenever you come and see me. [Chuckles] Well, come, my little rosebud. It's passed our bedtime, you know. Au revoir. [Professor Sighing] Oh! - Cicero! - Yes, sir. Yes, I wasn't sleepin'. I was just restin' my eyes. Well, this is hardly what a gentleman expects of a gentleman's gentleman. A flne way you choose to welcome your master home after the day's commerce. There should be a blazing fire, hot punch. Yes, sure would be nice. - But... - I was never without my nightcap. I never knowed you had but the one cap, Mr... I have put up with your perpetual unconsciousness! I've overlooked your careless treatment of my establishment! But no one can remain on my domestic staff... and speak slightingly of the Appleby wardrobe. I am known as the beau of Cherry Street. As for you, Cicero, I have come to the conclusion... that this apartment is not big enough for both of us. Uh, maybe we can get a bigger apartment... - Out of my sight! You're flred! - [Mumbling] If there's nothing I can do about it. Nothing! Nothing! Absolutely nothing, Cicero. Our paths part. No, now what time you want me to be back in the morning? Oh, I should say 7:45, Cicero, as usual. That's all right. I hope you find your cap. - Professor. - What is it, my little apple cheeks? - Why did you take that clock? - Clock? W-What clock would that be, my sweet? I remember no clock. The one you put your hat over. I saw you. Why, of course not. You ought to know that I wouldn't take a small clock like that. I mean, I wouldn't take any clock, large or small. After all, my dear child, I'm a musician, not a thief. [Clock Cuckooing] All right, Professor. All I can say is that... this is a coincidence that leaves me embarrassed... and nonplussed. I wouldn't convict a dog on circumstantial evidence. And, yet, it's as broad as it is long. I admit that, now and then, I'm tempted... to pick up some small article that doesn't belong to me. But, on the other hand, 'm just as likely... to leave something behind that's mine. I didn't leave my hat at Mrs. Drew's, did I? L... Oh, no. I have it here. Well... [Sighs] Would you like me to give you a birdcall or two? Maybe the whippoorwill at twilight to help you to go to sleep? No! [Horse Approaching] Why, child, back so soon and so early? - I brought it back. - Brought what back? - Your cuckoo clock. - Why? What on earth are you doing with this? I, l... Well, I stole it last night. - Well! - It's a funny thing about me. I'm so wicked. Isn't it awful? - You stole this? - Right under your very nose. I really don't know what's to become of me, I'm so bad. Professor says he doesn't know. He says I'm gonna wind up in the "pinchitentiary" if not in jail. Are you sure someone else didn't take this? Oh, goodness! You don't mean the professor, do you? He wouldn't take it. He's too honest. He made me bring it back. Are you, are you going to have me arrested? [Laughs] Well... I really believe I should. But I don't imagine you're a very hardened criminal. - [Knocking] - Come in. Colonel Loring and Miss Betty to see you, ma'am. - The Lorings? - Yes, ma'am, and the colonel... is ravin' somethin' awful, Mrs. Drew. - Well, don't stand there, Rufus. - Yes, ma'am. - Tell him I'll be right down. - Yes, ma'am. You wait here, darling. I want to talk to you. Hey, what did the bluebird say [Humming] Well, if it isn't Miss, uh... Miss... Appleby. Sylvia Dolores Appleby. - They call me Dimples. - [Clock Cuckooing] Do you like that cuckoo? Us Applebys know all about birds. Someday I'll have the professor come over and do some cuckoo calls for you. He can cuckoo even better than the cuckoo can cuckoo. Mmm, quite a talented family. Oh, yes. We Applebys are very talented. Why, even the professor used to be the best actor in the world, he says. I suppose you want to go on stage too. Someday I'm going to. I'm going to play Macbeth, just like the professor did. [Chuckles] Wouldn't you like to play a younger part? Say, a little girl like yourself? Well, maybe... just to begin with. I'll tell you what you do. You have your grandfather take you to the National Theater to see a friend... a beautiful young lady. Here. I'll write her name down for you. - Is she an actress? - Yes. Are you in love with her? - Why, l... - [Rufus] I beg your pardon, sir. - Your aunt wants to see you. - Thank you, Rufus. - Well, come along, Dimples. - Your aunt told me to wait here. - Allen, maybe you can explain. - Explain what, Aunt Caroline? - I want to break our engagement, Allen. - Oh. - Is that all you can say? - I'm sorry it had to happen this way, but I think Betty is right. It would be the best thing for both of us. But why? I don't understand. - You see, Aunt Caroline... - I'll tell you why. It's common gossip that Allen has become involved with an actress, that he spends most of his time with these low people of the theater. He's even talking about putting up money to produce a play for this creature! I regret that I had to tell you this, Caroline, but it's time you knew. Oh. Allen, it isn't true what he said about the actress, is it? I'm afraid it is, Aunt Caroline. Of all things, an actress. Allen, how could you? You know how I hate the theater and all that it stands for. - I love her, and we're to be married. - Married? Alan, you can't do it! I won't let you ruin your life! My mind is made up, Aunt Caroline. You're an ungrateful, disobedient, shameless boy. And as long as you stay in my house, I must insist that you observe my wishes! In that case, I'll have to look for another place to stay. Allen. I'm sorry, Aunt Caroline. I'd hoped you'd understand. If you leave this house, you need never expect to come back to it... as long as I live. I'll get my things. [Squeaking] [Squeaking Continues] Child, are you hurt? I don't think so. Nope. I feel dandy. Oh, well, you frightened me. Oh, that was nothing. Once I fell off the roof of McGuire Saloon. - Good heavens! Were you hurt? - No. - I fell on Mrs. O'Casey. - Mrs. O'Casey? Yes. She's fat and very soft. [Chuckles] Once I was leaning out of a hayloft, and Skinny waved to me and... [Sobbing] What? You're crying. Oh, no, child. Is it because he's going away? Yes. I'm going to miss him. He was all I had. Now he's leaving me. Sometimes I wonder if men are worth all the trouble they give us. [Kids Shouting] Hello, Mrs. O'Casey! Hello! Hello, Dimples! How are you, Mrs. O'Casey? How's Mr. O'Casey? That's Mrs. O'Casey. She's the lady I fell on. [Chuckling] - Hello, Skinny! - Hello, Dimples! He's not really skinny. We just call him that. - Won't you sit down, Mrs. Drew? - Thank you. And Cicero. Cicero! - Yes, sir. I was just outside. - Oh, there you are. - Yes. A little tea for Mrs. Drew. - Tea? Spread the table. You can pour. - Pour what? - Uh, no. No, thank you. - Oh, you're quite sure? - Yes. Well, then Cicero, you can get on with your marketing. - Market? - Let me see. I think I'd relish a nice flllet for dinner. - We ain't never paid... - Cooked in your own inimitable ways. [Both Chattering, Indistinct] [Chuckles] Yes. There's a quiet splendor about the aboriginal servant, Mrs. Drew. Which, unfortunately, is not always shared by their masters. - [Clears Throat] - [Stammers] Professor, your granddaughter is a remarkable child... an appealing child. As briefly as I've known her, I've become... very fond of her. Yes, that's easy to see, Mrs. Drew, and quite easy to understand too. In fact, I'm so fond of her, that I want to propose something to you... something for her good. I'm going to ask you to let her come and live with me... and let me do all I can for her. You mean that l-I should give Dimples up? Well, this sort of life... isn't what a child should have. You understand that. For all your love and devotion, you aren't helping Dimples. You're hurting her. You may even ruin her whole life. But l-l-I... I love Dimples. I know that. That's why I'm asking it of you. It wouldn't mean a complete separation. You could see her whenever you wished. - And perhaps I could help you too. - How? Perhaps I might ease your life, provide you with a sum of money, say $5,000. Five thousand dollars for Dimples? Five thousand, if you let her come and live with me. Oh... - [Clears Throat] - I must run along, Professor. You give a lot of thought to what I've said. I'm sure you'll agree with me. Good-bye, darling. I'm going to see you again soon. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Please don't sell me, Professor. - Please. - Why, bless your heart. I wouldn't sell you for all the money in the world. I thought you might want the $5,000. Oh, my sweet, sweet child. There's nothing in the whole world that could take you from me. Nothing. I... I love you, Professor. I'm gonna make myself worthy of that love. When somebody loves somebody Everything and everybody Makes life A happy song When somebody has nobody Birds won't sing and that somebody Finds life without a song If you want to see a picture Of the whole world upside down Just picture me Without you And you without me Just close your eyes and you'll see How Ionesome we'd be Stars would fall, dreams would all Crumble Down for good Castles would tumble There'd be no me Without you No you without me And yet nobody could be As happy as we Smiling through, clinging Together What would I do Without you And you without me It's all for the best, Allen. You're free now. Of course. I just feel sorry for Aunt Caroline. She's done so much for me. If she knew I'd actually gone into the theater business, well... I believe she'd change her name. That's better than what you thought she'd do... cut you off without a cent. - Oh, she did that. - She did? Yes. But I have some money of my own. That's how I made Le Douve play. All the same, I hate having to hurt her. You've made me happy. Isn't that important too? So important that I'm glad I gave up everything else to do it. I'm going to have my name on the bills and a star on my dressing room door? - A dozen stars. - [Footsteps Approaching] [Professor In Next Room] Remember now, we start to leave the minute I refuse his first offer. That, uh, sounds like Professor Appleby. I sent for him to talk about his grandchild. She'd be perfect for the part of the little girl. It's mighty shrewd of Drew to send for me. An actor of my reputation can't hurt him. After all... - Well, I knew it was you. Come in. - Ah... [Chuckles] Yes. Yes. This is Professor Appleby and his granddaughter, um... Sylvia Dolores Appleby. But they call me Dimples. Oh, yes. Miss Cleo Marsh. - Oh, I'm greatly honored, Miss Marsh. - Hello. Miss Marsh has the leading role in our new play. Ah, opposite me, I suppose. [Chuckles] There's nothing I like better than to get my teeth into a good romantic role. "But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? "It is the east and Juliet is the sun. Arise..." Uh. - "Arise..." - "Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon." Yes. "Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon." Isn't he simply wonderful? [Chuckles] I was quite a matinee idol in those days. I still get letters from ladies in the towns where I played. - Yes. - Yes. - Landladies. - Eh, oh, oh, no. - No. L... - Well, uh, Shakespeare isn't exactly what I had in mind. - Oh, no? - Well, do your birdcalls. - They're beautiful. - Yes, yes. Mr. Drew, you'd better close your windows. - Your room will be full of birds. - Oh, I don't mind that. Oh, very well. Eh, let me see, uh. Uh, yes. The, uh, the, uh, the robin calling to the blue jay. [Imitating Birdcall] [Both Laughing] The blue jay responding. [Imitating Same Birdcall] - [Chuckles] - Isn't that simply wonderful? But they sound the same to me. I can't tell any difference. Aha, but the bird can. [Laughing] - Yes. - Well, I wanted to talk about, Dimples. Oh, you want her too? Well, you're shrewder than I thought, Mr. Drew. My granddaughter and I make an excellent team. Just watch us. Cicero, "The Fling." [Harmonica] [Band] That's a charming dance, but we couldn't possibly... - We can do jokes too. - Yes. Professor, I sent for you because I wanted Dimples... for a part in the new play I'm going to produce. I hate to disappoint you, but I wanted her, not you. Oh, well, that's flne. Fine. Couldn't you flx it so the professor could do it instead of me? I'm sorry, but the part is for a little girl. Then you'd better get some other little girl. I wouldn't be any good without the professor. Your grandfather could work right along with us, if he wanted to. - Yes. - The theater business is new to me. I could use a helper, sort of an assistant. Sir, I've never been an assistant in my life. - Oh, I'm sorry and... - I'll make an exception in this case. - Splendid! - Yes. L-I congratulate you, Mr. Drew. No Appleby has ever been associated with a failure. And with us in your organization, your play is a success already. - [Laughs] - Didn't I tell you he was wonderful? Quite. You're going to do a beautiful play, Dimples... a play that's never been produced before. It's about a little girl named Eva... who tries to help the slaves down South... and an old colored man who loves her named Uncle Tom. The gospel train is a-comin' - [Humming] - I hear it just at hand I hear the car wheels movin' and a-rumblin' through the land - Oh, get on board, get on board - Little children - Get on board - Little children, there's room for many a more - Choom, choom, choom - I hear the bell and whistle a-comin' around the curve She's playin' all her steamin' power and strainin' every nerve - Oh, get on board - Get on, children - Get on board - Get on, children - Get on board - Little children, there's room for many a more The fare is cheap and all can go The rich and poor are there No second-class aboard this train no difference in the fare - Oh, get on board - Get on, children - Get on board - Little children - Get on board - Little children, there's room for many a more She's there and now the station Oh, better don't be late But come and get your tickets and be ready for this train - Oh, get on board - Get on, children - Get on board - Little children - Get on board - Little children, there's room for many a more - Oh, get on board, children - Children, get on board Get on board little children There's room for many a more You gave me $40... to pay for the tickets. I had them printed for $37.50. That leaves you a clear profit of $2 and a half, and here it is to the penny. - Yes, sir, to the penny. - Fine. You've done an excellent job. Yes. And now I'll need $95 for advertising. As long as you're paying the bills, I think it would save time if you handled all the money. Uh... oh. Here it is. About $800. It's all I have left and just enough to finance the rest of the production. Uh, uh, all right. You trust me with this? Yes, of course. Well, thank you very much, Allen, for your faith in me. I'll, uh, I'll handle this money... just as though it were my own. [Kids Shouting, Playing] - Professor? - Yeah? What does that sign say? Uh. Oh. It, uh, it says, uh... Oh, yeah, it says, "No Smoking Allowed." Well, then why don't you stop smoking? Well, l... - Uh, oh, yeah. - [Man] Well, I'll give you $600. Sir, do you realize this was Napoleon's watch, given to him by Josephine the night before Waterloo? Why it's worth $ 2,000 if it's worth a cent. 'll put it up to a stranger. Ah, there's a gentleman... who looks like he might know something about antique jewelry. He wouldn't know anything about jewelry. I, sir, am a recognized authority... which leads me not to recognize your remark. My good man, what would you say a watch like this is worth? Uh, oh, that's a superb antique. I, uh, I had one just like it myself. There you are, and I never saw this gentleman before in all my life. I'll give you $700 for it. I haven't the money here, but if you'll come to my bank with me, I'll give you $800 for it. I'm sorry, gentlemen. Yea, it grieves me, but my boat is departing for the Orient in half an hour. And, well, I guess I'll have to give it to Richards. - You're a very lucky man, sir. - J-Just a minute. - Can I talk to you a second? - Oh, yes. Of course. I hate to see Richards get a bargain like that. - I don't like him. - I detest him. If you could get ahold of that watch and come up to my bank in Harlem, I'd take it off your hands... and I'll give you $10 for your trouble. Oh... could you make that $15? - You drive a hard bargain. I'll do it. - Heh! - There you are, sir, $700. - I'll give you $800 for the watch. But I haven't got any more money. You said it was mine for $700. - Oh, no. This gentleman gets it for $800. - Thank you very much. I consider this a great favor. [Chuckles] But look here, that's hardly fair. I came here with $700 to buy a watch, and you give it to someone else. Here. Here's the watch. - Watch? What watch? - Why, it's Napoleon's watch. You have the wrong man. I'm not Napoleon. Uh, you're not... No. But you said... You told me... - [Stammering] - I never saw you before in my life, sir! You ne... Why, here... Uh... Uh! Oh, eh, eh, eh, eh... Don't you see that sign? - Well? Who's smoking? - Huh... - Well, seeing you're a friend of mine... - Yes? I'll, uh, give you a dollar and a half for it. A dollar and a... You don't understand. - This watch belonged to Napoleon. - It did, eh? - Yes. - Well, that makes it secondhand. Sec... Ah, Tom, my boy, the whole world is empty as an eggshell. I know it, massah, I know it. - It seems to be given... - Ah, there you are, Professor Appleby. - We've been waiting for you. - Yes? Well, to what do I owe that honor? Well, we supplied you everything for your play. We're the creditors, one might say, and Mr. Drew told us you would give us our money. - Money? What money? - The money Mr. Drew owes for scenery. - And the costumes and the... - Oh, yes, that money. You're surely not suggesting that Mr. Drew and I intend to defraud you. Mr. Drew, you told us that he would pay us our money. Yes, of course. Pay them, Professor. Well, I, uh... I don't like their attitude, Allen. I never heard of people doing business this way. - Why argue? Pay them and get it over. - Uhh... Yes, well, the truth is, I flnd myself a little short. Short? How much? Well, it's around $800. That's all the money I gave you. - It wasn't my fault. I was cheated. - That's all the money I had! I was stupid enough to trust a scoundrel like you. You blundering old fool! The professor said that you'd pay us. Now, what about it? I'm sorry, but you heard what he said. You're going to pay me. Nobody's going to put anything over on Emery T. Hawkins. And you're not through with me either. That's what I get for giving credit to a bluffing upstart. - Let's haul this stuff out. - I'm gonna send a wagon for my stuff. [Chattering] Take it out and put it on the truck. Well, I guess that ends everything. I didn't mean to do it, Dimples. - Do you see? - You broke your promise to me. But the man swore to me. He gave me his word. You told me you wouldn't steal anymore. But what I really meant... I mean, l-l-l... I didn't buy the watch for myself. L-l... You said you were going to be honest. Uhh. Well, I guess I'm not much good. Maybe you'd be better off without me. - But I thought you had money, Allen. - I did have... enough, anyway. I guess I didn't take care of it very well. Well, uh, what are you going to do now? I suppose I can get a job somewhere... and maybe save up enough money to do the show. That needn't change our plans about marriage any, Cleo. I don't suppose money is very important to people who are really in love. You can say that because you've always had money. - Perhaps. - I'm afraid this changes everything. Then you're not really in love with me. Oh, you mustn't say that, darling. I'll run along. Good-bye, Allen. [Allen] Good-bye. I'm awfully sorry, Allen. Look here, Drew. It's all right for the rest. They can take their things back and sell them. These costumes have been made to fit your play. They're not worth a penny to anybody else. How am I going to get my money out of them? - Sorry, but there's nothing I can do. - We'll see about that! Somebody's going to jail for this! Mrs. Drew, do you still think I'm worth $5,000? You're worth ever so much more, darling. And do you still want me to come and live with you? I can't think of anything I'd like more. All right, I'll come. Have you got the $5,000 with you? [Laughing] I'll be right out! It won't take me more than a minute. So you're really going. Yes, Professor. Well, I knew it was the best thing for you, but l-I didn't think you'd want to go. Well, it's like Mrs. Drew said, "A little girl shouldn't be raised in this kind of'envinoment."' Yes, you'll... be much better off... in that nice, big house. Of course, it'll be Ionely. There'll be no children to play with. But I gotta think of the future, Professor. That's what Mrs. Drew says. Yes, and she's right. And she'll see that you get the right kind of food too. Plenty of carrots... maybe three or four times a day. Of course, you won't be able to go fishing with me anymore. But I guess it's the best thing. Fishing isn't any too good for little girls. I like fishing fine. But I guess it isn't good for little girls. No, l... I guess it isn't. - [Knocking] - Come in. - Well, I think I'll be going. - A note from Miss Drew, sir. - Are you ready, miss? - I'm ready. - Ahh... - Good-bye, Professor. Good-bye, my little angel. You'll come and see me sometimes, won't you? Of course I will. And you're gonna take good care of yourself like you said you would? I will. And you'll... be good too? Uh, yeah. [Knocking] Mr. Professor, there's a man without a policeman, Mr. Hawkins, to see you. - I'm not here. Tell him I'm not here. - Yes, sir. - Mr. Hawkins, he's gone... - Not here, eh? Listen, Appleby, I've come here to give you one more chance... to pay for those costumes. If you don't, I'll have you in jail in an hour. L... You'll have your money tonight. I might've known you'd try that. I should've sent the law. I made a mistake coming here myself. You certainly did, Mr. Hawkins, and if you don't get out, I'll be tempted to pull off one of your arms and beat your head in with it! Professor, I didn't know he was gonna start nothin'! The professor used to dance and sing for me after dinner. But, of course, the dinners weren't good for me. Last night we had wieners... four a piece! Can you do birdcalls? [Clinking] [Clears Throat] Professor Appleby to see you, Mrs. Drew. - Oh, yes. Come right in, Professor. - Oh, ho. - I see you got my note. - Yes, thank you. I, uh... I guess it's better for everyone concerned. Dimples will be happy, and my debts will be paid. And as for me, l... I guess I ought to be glad to know that Dimples has such a fine home. You won't be sorry for this, Professor. I wonder if I might see Dimples for a minute, just to say good-bye. Oh, yes, of course. Rufus, take Professor Appleby to Dimples' room. - Yes, ma'am. - Ah, thank you. Why, my darling. Oh, Professor! Oh! Why, what's wrong with my little girl? Aren't you happy here? Oh, yes, yes, I'm very happy. I hurt my finger. Where? Are you sure? Of course. There. That's better, isn't it? [Chuckles] There we are. And you can see this lovely dress Mrs. Drew got me. Yes, it's beautiful. Must've cost a lot of money, huh? And she's gonna buy me some dolls too... three of them. Ah, you're a very lucky little girl, and I'm happy to know that you've got such a nice home. It isn't every little girl who can have such a good "envinoment." [Crying] Oh, my darling. I'm gonna take you home. No, Professor. Mrs. Drew says I'm gonna have a lot of advantages here. Yes, but no place is nice for my little girl when it makes her cry. You're going home with me. But if I stay here, you won't have to go to jail. You can give Allen back his money. [Chuckles] I won't go to jail, sweet. Mrs. Drew, l... I'm terribly sorry. It was in a moment of great weakness that I took this money. - Oh... - When I saw my little girl crying, I realized there wasn't enough money in the world to compensate me for that. You saw her crying? I don't understand. Don't you like it here? I do, but I get so Ionesome without the professor. [Chuckles] I was willing to give her up, knowing all you could do for her, but I see now that... Dimples needs me as much as I need her. Oh! I guess I was foolish to imagine... the child could ever become as fond of me as she is of you. I admire your honesty and respect you for declining the money. - Oh, thank you, Mrs. Drew. - And I thank you too. You know, I wouldn't go away if the professor could live here too. Mrs. Drew, why don't you marry the professor? [Laughing] Why, my dear child... Then your house wouldn't be so Ionesome. Professor's lots of fun. - [Coughing] - I'd marry him if I was grown up. Course, he hasn't much money, but you've got a lot. [Giggles] Yes, well, I, uh, think perhaps you'd better run along, darling, and get your things. - I'll be with you in a minute. - Good-bye, Mrs. Drew. Maybe you can come and see us some day. At our house, you won't have to eat any carrots! Oh! Heh, heh! Well, good-bye, Mrs. Drew, and thank you for all your kindness. Of course, you realize, Mrs. Drew, I was only doing this to save our poor little home. Why, yes, of course. But thanks to a kindly providence, I still have means of getting the money. Of course, it will mean that I'll have to sell my one remaining heirloom, something that's been in the family for generations, but I'll do it. Oh, that's too bad. I wouldn't mind so much if I didn't have to sell it at such a great sacrifice. But it seems a pity that these money-grubbing jewelers... should get the watch for $1,000... when it's easily worth five times that much. - The watch? - Yes, yes. Napoleon's watch. - Oh! - Eh, Josephine gave it to him, and he gave it to my grandfather at Elba. Hmm, poor, dear Grandfather. If he'd ever guessed that I'd have to sell Napoleon's watch... to a money-grubbing jeweler... - Is that it? - Yes. Isn't it a beautiful thing? - Is there anything I could do? - Oh, no, no, Mrs. Drew. I couldn't take money from you. But, uh, perhaps... perhaps you'd let me give it to you. - Why... - I'd like you to have it. You're very kind, but I couldn't take it. Of course, you could give me the small pittance that the jewelers offered, and someday when fortune smiles on me again I'll buy it back from you. For Dame Fortune is a fickle gypsy, always blind and often tipsy. [Chuckles] - A thousand dollars? - Yes, dear lady. - Oh. - You'll take care of it, won't you? - Yes. - Now I know just how Napoleon felt... when he had to give up this beautiful trinket. Oh, thank you. Good night, Mrs. Drew. Good night. - What a lovely hand. - Why, Professor. - Oh ho! Pardon me. I forgot myself. - Oh! - I didn't realize my position. - [Laughs] But after all, Mrs. Drew, I'm only human, and your charms are irresistible. [Both Laugh] Good night. Good night. [Crowd Chatter] Uh, 35 cents for one ticket? Well, opening night prices are a little high, but those are the best seats in the house. [Clears Throat] Well, Allen's play opens tonight. I'm afraid Betty is still fond of Allen. - I've forbidden her to see him. - Have you? Yes, the theater's ruined that young man. - Can't we speak of something else? - Hmm? Yes, of course. [Chuckles] Oh, by the way, I thought you might be interested... in an old emerald ring that I picked up at auction. Five hundred years old. One of the finest things in my collection. Mmm. I know so little about these things. By the way... I have something I think might interest you... the watch Josephine gave Napoleon. - Oh! - Professor Appleby had it in his family for many years. Oh. Mm-hmm. Mm. Well, if that watch belonged to Napoleon, it was given to him 20 years after he died. - What? - This thing is tin. An obvious fake. But I gave the professor a thousand dollars for it. Then you were robbed. The watch is worthless. And after I helped him. I kept him out of jail. I trusted him. I believed all the kind things he said. - The man has made a fool of you. - He hasn't yet! I'm going to show him that I can be just as merciless as he can! Get your hat, Jasper. We're going to the police station! - Can you see her? - Who, darlin'? Oh, don't pretend. I know you're looking for Betty. I don't see her. I don't suppose she'll be here. I'm just a doorman, miss, and orders is orders. That's all right, Spike. We're expecting her. - You're expecting me? - As if you didn't know! [Giggles] - Did you flnd her yet? - No. I didn't think she'd come. Betty. I think I'd better go and rehearse my lines. - This is the nicest surprise I've had. - I came to wish you good luck. This is good luck, Betty. I didn't think you'd ever look at me again after the fool I made of myself. I'm willing to forget all that, Allen. But Father never will. If he knew I'd come here, he'd be in a rage. [Man] Ten minutes! - Come with me, and I'll get you a seat. - Ten minutes! [Applause] [Orchestra] [Continues] [Laughter] Oh, Topsy, Topsy. You've been very bad again. - We want to see Professor Appleby. - You'll have to wait here. I'll see if I can find him. Don't you think all of this can wait until tomorrow, Caroline? - You know how I loathe this place. - No! He must be arrested. It wasn't bad enough that he robbed me of the money. He also had the insolence to put the money into this foul venture of Allen's. Mr. Appleby! Mr. Appleby! - Yes? - Do you happen to know two policemen? - Two policemen? - Yeah, policemen. - What... - They're lookin' for you. Oh... [Stammering] Yes, I know 'em! [Pants] I do like you, Topsy. I like you because you've never had any father or mother. I like you, and I want you to be good. - I want you to be good for my sake. - [Laughing] Lord, missy! I'd be ashamed to be good! [Laughing Continues] Oh, Topsy, Topsy. I'm sorry for you. Have you kids seen a suspicious-Iooking character around here? - [All Laugh] - I beg your pardon! [Whispers] Dimples! Hey, you! What are you duckin' in and out of the place for? Are you tryin' to hide? - Who, me? - Yes, you! Why, I was sitting there tending to my own business. If you don't mind, I'll go back to attending to my business. Uncle Tom on stage. On stage, Uncle Tom. - On stage, Uncle Tom. - [Policeman] Hey! - I thought you said you were Uncle Tom. - Yes, you're quite right. - I am Uncle Tom. - You're supposed to be on the stage. Uhh, on the st... Uh, yes, I am. Thank you very much for calling my attention to it. I, uh... Heh heh! I was going to make my entrance through the exit. [Chuckles] Stupid of me, wasn't it? [Clears Throat] [Man] On stage, Uncle Tom. [Dimples] Oh, Uncle Tom! Uncle Tom! - Eh! - Oh, Uncle Tom! Uncle Tom! Aha! Here I is, Miss Eva. Well, here I is, Miss Eva. [Laughter] [Whispering] Professor! Get off! Get off! - Eh, well, good-bye! - Bye! - You're under arrest! - Oh, but I is Uncle Tom. You're Uncle Tom? You're Professor Appleby! I knew all the time! - Oh, no, I'm playin' in the show here. - No! - Will you come with me, Uncle Tom? - Yes, Miss Eva. My only duty is to tend to you. [Applause] - What's the matter? - Everything's all right, darling. I... I just want to talk for a few minutes with these gentlemen. Never mind that. He's under arrest for stealing a thousand dollars. - He stole... - But I didn't take it for myself. - I wanted to pay Allen back. Really. - Oh, come on! You leave him alone! He didn't steal anything from you! I'm sorry, darling, but you'll be better off this way. There isn't much time, Dimples. You'd better hurry for the last act. - I'm going to jail with the professor. - Please, Aunt Caroline. - This is my affair, Allen. - It's painful, but it has to be done. The man is a thief. No, darling. You've gotta stay and finish the play. I can't do it, Professor. I can't. - I can't! [Whimpering] - Now, listen. No Appleby ever quit a show. We've always been troupers. When you get to be a little older, you'll know what that means. You've got big scenes to play, darling, and I want you to play 'em just as though you thought... I was out here to watch. She'll stay. Won't you, pumpkins? If... If you want me to, Professor. That's right. And you'll give a good performance too, won't you? I'll try. That's my little girl. I'm proud of you. And I'm proud of you too. Well, l... I'm ready to go now. Oh Swing low, sweet chariot Kindly sit down in this box until the scene is over. Young man, are you suggesting that we witness this foul exhibition? - We will not sit down! - The show is on. Sit and stop talking. - I will not! - We are not degenerates! Officer, can't you make these people understand? They'll disrupt the show. Very well, Jasper. Let's not make a scene. It'll only last a minute. Comin'for to carry me home, oh Swing low, sweet chariot - Betty's here! Shh! - Comin'for to carry me home [Humming] Well, you're looking much better, dear. In a day or two, you're going to be as strong as a lion. No, Papa. You needn't pretend, because I know. You know what, dear? That I'm going away, and very soon. Oh, my baby, you mustn't think those things. I wouldn't be surprised if you were out of bed by tomorrow, playing with Topsy. No, Father. The angels told me. They told me last night... when my head hurt so. They're going to take me to Heaven. Now, you'll feel more cheerful when you've had a nap. I am cheerful, Papa, because Heaven is beautiful. But... But I'll miss you. You're not going to leave me, my pet... not for a long, long time. And there's something else that makes me sad. Can't something be done for Uncle Tom and his people? What do you mean, dear? They love their children as much as you love me. Uncle Tom loves his children. - Please do something for them. - Anything I can, dear. Eva? You'll give Uncle Tom his freedom, won't you, Papa? I will, dear. I will. Eva? Eva? I can see those great gates. They're made of pearls! And they're opening wide. And there are angels. They're calling for me. I'm coming. I'm... coming. Eva! Eva! She doesn't hear. [Sobbing] It's over. Praise the Lord, massah. It's over. Oh, swing low Sweet chariot Comin'for to carry me home Oh, swing low Sweet chariot Comin'for to carry me home - Bravo! Bravo! - Bravo! Well, I guess we better go now. Yes, I guess so. Obviously you haven't a heart. Who'd think of taking that lovely child away from her grandfather... after he helped Allen produce this beautiful play? Well, I thought you said the theater was a bad influence. I'll thank you not to interfere with my affairs! Let him go. Oh, thank you, Mrs. Drew. You're a woman of great character and discrimination. - [Applause, Cheering Continues] - May I? - [Applause] - Wait! Don't go! We have a treat for you tonight. The entire company, headed by our charming little star, has prepared a celebration for the first anniversary of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Out of the South has recently come a new form of entertainment. Our company wishes to be the first to present it in New York, - if it is your pleasure. - [Applause] [Orchestra] [Fanfare] [Applause] [Chorus] The Louisiana moon is shining down from starry skies Above, mm-mm The Ionesome Ionely old and breaking heart Just needs a lady love, mm-mm While the shades of night were falling, falling You could hear him softly calling Dixie-Anna, oh, Miss Dixie-Anna Don't keep me waitin' Ain't you gonna come out tonight Full moon shinin' and my heart a-pinin' Come out and meet me in the moonlight Can't you understand Love is in the air Lovers hand in hand strolling everywhere Dixie-Anna, oh, Miss Dixie-Anna Don't keep me waitin' Ain't you gonna come out tonight Glowin' and shinin' and my heart a-pinin' Come out and meet me in the moonlight Dixie-Anna, oh, Miss Dixie-Anna Don't keep me waitin' Ain't you gonna come out tonight Moon a-shinin' and my heart a-pinin' Come out and meet me in the moonlight Can't you understand Love is in the air Lovers hand in hand strolling everywhere Dixie-Anna, oh, Miss Dixie-Anna Don't keep me waitin' Ain't you gonna come out tonight Moon a-shinin' and my heart a-pinin' Come out and meet me in the moonlight Mr. Bowes, why is it a fireman wears red suspenders?
