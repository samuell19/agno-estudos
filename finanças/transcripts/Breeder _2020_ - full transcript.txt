I don't like dogs. I was bitten as a child. I just don't trust them. It's different with Karat. On the good days, it's like we merge. My will becomes his will. His muscles become my strength. We both know who's in charge. But where do we draw the line? How much can you get away with when you hold the reins? How far can I push him to achieve my goals? I have to believe that I know what's best for him. But maybe all I really am is his jailer. This is Thomas Lindberg. You aren't performing. Why shouldn't I just move everything into an index fund? No, it's not a threat. It's a fair question. Well, call me back when you have an answer. Our research shows that Resurrecta extends the telomeres - - and lowers the C-reactive protein. The telomeres are the strands at the tip of the DNA, showing biological age. Precisely. We turn back the clock, so to speak. - Have you taken the cure? - Not yet. For now, we only have a solution for male clients - - and my DNA has rare stems, so it's not that easy in my case. - Is Resurrecta a tablet? - No, it's a treatment complex. Soon, our clients can be treated at our new facilities. - Maybe we could look at some images? - Yes. At the old sugar factory, we will create an exclusive treatment centre - - with its own hotel for clients from all over the world. Might we have a look at the lab? We can't have journalists over there. I'm sorry. Some would say that you're manipulating a natural process. - There's nothing natural about ageing. - How so? Ageing is a disease. A combination of various diseases. Cancer, diabetes, cardiac problems. Old age is the disease - - that prevents the body from fighting these issues. Many would consider that an extreme stance. What's your mother's name? - Her name is Anna Maria Shack. - That's right. The painter. She's a very gifted woman. She's, what, in her 60s now? - Does she remember your name? - Is this interview about me now? When you visit her, does she remember your name? - How do you know about that? - I do my research too. Dementia is horrifying, isn't it? It's probably too late for your mother, unfortunately. But maybe not for you. Hi, Ruben. I just saw you on "Agenda". I'd like you to come by. Thank you. You're so cute! - That baby suits you. - Hi, Ruben. He's so cute. A sweet child. - Hi! You have a sweet son. - She doesn't speak Danish. - The neighbour. You have a strong pelvic floor. A true rider. You are 27? - No, 32. - Women's fertility peaks at 16. Could you tell Thomas that? The next Olympics are in three years. It's perfect timing. Fish oil, vitamin D and zinc. And double the dose. Hi, honey. It's going to be amazing. We agreed not to make it public until I had closed the financing. - We don't have the money. - This isn't about money. It's about being first. This is groundbreaking. If we wait too long - - someone from China or Stanford will discover what I've discovered. - Then it'll be too late. - The treatment hasn't been approved. I'm just trying to generate some excitement, all right? - Your trials are barely past phase one. - Yes, it's moving too slowly. Do you know Peter Rosenthal-Haefner? This photo was taken last year. This is what he looks like now. - Is it photoshopped? - Google him. He looks like that now. Men like him don't give a damn about the FDA and the Medicines Agency. They want their lives back now. If they can have that... Money won't be an issue, Thomas. From now on, you'll follow the rules. Do nothing without my approval. - Or what? - I'm the owner of the factory. - I can bar you from your lab. - I see. Well... I have 14 reasons you'd never do it. 14 reasons... That was very subtle. I'm just playing the hand you dealt me. - Just play by the rules, all right? - Fine. Whatever you say. He is lucky to have you. You're very beautiful. Could you tell him that? He's more likely to listen to you. That's not how it works. First, show him the cookie jar. Then tell him that he can't have any. That's how it's always been with him. What do you think? Is he good-looking? - Who's that? - He works for Saltum. They want to sponsor me. Would you like to go out for dinner? - I can't. I'm having dinner with him. - When will you be home? I have to get up at 5 AM so I'll sleep in the guest room. I don't mind an early wakeup. I need my beauty sleep. You're ruining my lipstick! - Are you sure? - Yes. - Thomas? - I can't do that. But that's not true. What are you ashamed of? I can give you anything you want. - Except for one small thing. - "One small thing"? - Don't leave during an argument. - Why have you become so fucking weird? - Can she hear me? - No idea. They use it to anaesthetise cows. Get up! Are you puking in my car? - Can you wait until we get back? - It's easier when she's lying still. - Turn the volume down. - Don't you like the music? We can't go that way, the road's closed. I told you. Pull over here. Pull over. You have to turn around. - Which way should I go? - Turn around and go back. I didn't know the road was closed. Looks aren't always the most important thing to women. - Just be there for them in bed. - That's not working either, I'm afraid. - I told you to start rapamycin years ago. - I know. I made a mistake. It's an NDA. We can't discuss this further until you've signed it. We are rather proud of our results. - Isn't that Peter Rosenthal-Haefner? - I need to remove that photo. - We have no names. Only numbers. - Like a Swiss bank account. Yes. You could say that. Except you pay in crypto. This is not a negotiation. Well, the amount isn't that important. Sit down. Open wide. Your arm, please. Can you tell me a little bit about the treatment? - How is it done? - I can't reveal my methods. - Is the lab in the other building? - Our capacity is limited here. I have a long waiting list of clients who don't ask too many questions. - I can't accept this conduct. - Fine. Then we'll stop here. There you go. Is it legal to write "doctor" when you're a vet? Itâ€™s sold in 50 countries, so I guess it's fine. Do you really think it works? Isn't it just bullshit? - How old do you think Ruben is? - Early forties? She's 61. No way. She hasn't aged a day in the ten years I've known her. - Okay, give me some of that. - Nope. You're not interested. What happened to you? - I fell off Karat yesterday. - Is that really a bruise from a fall? Yes. - Ouch! - Does it hurt? Yes. - Ouch! Thomas. - Does it hurt? Yes... Ouch! Help! They're after me. Thomas, bring a blanket! Bring a blanket, dammit! She's cold. They took me. They're after me. - I can't! - Thomas! The blanket! Don't touch me! She's psychotic. I'll take her to the hospital. We have to take her to the police. - I'll go with you. - No. You stay here! Hi, honey. Is everything okay? And... come home soon, please? What is this place? This is not the hospital. Hey! Hey! What the hell are you doing? No! No! Her name is Nika. I don't know her last name. It's probably something Russian. My husband drove her. Thomas Lindberg. Maybe she has been registered in his name? Could she be at another hospital? Okay. Thank you. THOMAS: SHE'S BEEN HOSPITALISED Ruben? - Ruben? - Sit down, Thomas. Just sit down. - Who was the man who took her? - He's just a caretaker I hired. "The Dog". His assistant is "the Pig". They manage things around here. - You said that the women volunteered. - That was the plan. - But it just wasn't possible. - That's unacceptable! - I told you it's just temporary. - Temporary? You imprison women and experiment on them. Look at me. How many are there? I think about her every single day. Don't worry. It won't be a problem for you. - For me! What about Elly? - Of course. Thomas... You'll get through this. I'll help you. Thomas. Don't sabotage this project. Don't sabotage this! Thomas! NO TRESPASSING Fuck! - Help me! - What? What did you say? Huh? Stop! Let go! Let go! There, there. Come here. Damn! Let's go. Mia? Mia? - Hi, Thomas. - Where is she? She's fine. Take off your clothes. Does Ruben know I'm here? I know her. Let me talk to her. - Now. - Just do what you're told. - Who the hell do you think...? - What? What did you say? What did you want to say? I really want to hear what you have to say. Nah. I didn't think so. Take your clothes off. Open it. How about trying it on? It suits you. We won't disturb the others now. Lie still, or this will get messy. All right. There. Good girl. You did well. Mia! Did it hurt? Did it? Do you need help? I hate you! What a racket. Just do what you're told. It'll be a lot easier that way. Are you the Dog? Where's Mia? - Is she down there? - You can't go in. - She's not one of them. - That's up to the samples, not you. Yes? Okay. You've got five minutes. Don't touch me. Why didn't you go to the hospital? I didn't know anything about this. I swear, I don't know anything about this. What have you gotten us into? I'll get you out of here, okay? Don't try to get out on your own. You're not going to leave me here, are you? - I don't know what that guy... - The psycho? - I don't know what he's capable of. - But I do! Time's up! - I'm scared they'll kill us. - Don't go! Honey, don't go! Thomas? Come. If only you wouldn't interfere. Don't you trust me? Give me your phone. Come on. Give it to me. - Don't leave the area. - What are you doing to her? We won't hurt her as long as you stay here. Help me! Help me! - Did you just kill her? - I don't know. You'll have to clean this up yourself. The boss will be furious. - Do we have an appointment? - I had dinner with Rosenthal-Haefner. - He looked 20 years younger! - The price has gone up by 50%. - 50%? - Yes, Johansson. - Go home. I've kept your samples. - When does the treatment begin? It'll be a while. But I'll keep you up to date. - Okay. - Good. Hand me number 3. Number 3. - Do pay attention. - Sure. Why don't you at least try to hide your incompetence? - You shouldn't talk to me like that. - Oh? Why? - Are you special or something? - I work around the clock. Yes, you do. Be grateful that you're allowed to. - Grateful? How did you expect...? - Stop. You're a sadistic misogynist, and I'm letting you live out your dreams. I haven't touched any of those girls in a sexual way. And you had better not. And that one... She's a hundred times more vital than you. Forget it. There are cameras everywhere. It's impossible to get out without being spotted. Nika's dead. I saw them do it! Who is 14K? Who is she? Her name was Elly. I killed her. No... We were at a party. Ruben and I. - Six months ago. - How...? Were you drunk? No. But there's a lot I can't remember. Ruben introduced us. Told me she was just my type. What does that mean? She wanted to be tied up. Why does Ruben know that? How does she know that you like that? How? What happened? I don't know. I just remember standing by the window. Looking outside. Elly was lying on the bed behind me. She had a rope around her neck. Ruben said she didn't have a pulse. Did you strangle her? Yes. I'm not getting out of here, am I? Thomas. Come here. - I want to show you something. - What? - Why is it so hot in here? - We need to keep it at 37 degrees. Look at this. This is a bio bag. It's the newest thing in neonatal research. Soon, we'll be able to grow our Resurrecta cells here. Efficiently. Risk-free. We just buy our ovaries abroad and carry out the process here. Does it work? We have problems developing them fully, but I'm working on a solution. But the best is yet to come. I found a method that also works for women. It's simple. I just add some of the client's DNA to the egg. So now you can live to be 180. I have trouble finding a matching donor. But our earnings will double, at the minimum. - What about the basement? - We'll remove everything. We can do light treatment and cryotherapy down there. - The women? - The animals will take care of them. And the animals? I'll take care of them. Thomas... Consider the greater perspective. Over the next ten years, you'll go from being a small investment advisor - - to one of the richest men in the world. But you know that, of course. Otherwise, you would've gone to the police. Right? What do I do about Mia? You'll find a way. You always do. What's happening? Where are we going? Do you have anything without sugar? I think there's a Coke Zero in the back. - What's she doing here? - She knows too much. - About what? - Me. - About Elly. 14K. - Thomas... - You'll take care of her. - No, not him. He doesn't like me. But I like you. Look. See how fine she is. Now that she's tied up, what would you want to do to her? Stop. What would you do? Make her cry? Would you like that? Or do you want to hit her? So she understands that you're in charge. That you can do with her just as you please. Just what you dream about. - I'll do it myself. He's a psycho. - Thomas... You can't do that to her. Okay. You're insane! Thomas... I want to hear about it later. No! That was too easy. - Come on, get them! - Go, go, go! Which way? Run! Run! Back off! - We have a DNA match. - For whom? Johansson? No. For you. For me... Show me. There. Who is it? What's your name? - Do you like anything at all? - What do you mean? You seem like someone who doesn't like anything. - That's not true. - Then what do you like? What's it to you? Chocolate. I like chocolate. What kind? - Cream heels. - What's that? A chocolate shaped like a heel. When you chew it - - mint cream comes out. It's a bit like After Eight, only better. It's not widely available anymore. Who was the first person who gave you a cream heel? Do you remember? My name is Mia Bille Lindberg. I'm 32 years old. My parents are Anne and Henning. I'm an only child. They only have me. Mia Bille Lindberg. Do you know what's going to happen now? First, I'll cut off your one arm and shove it up your pussy. Then I'll cut off the other and shove it down your throat. Fantastic! New plans. The boss needs her. Hello, Mia. You may feel slightly nauseous due to the anaesthesia. It's quite normal. - What are you doing to me? - Don't worry about that. Just relax. - Why are you doing this? - Just breathe deeply. Relax. What a nice egg you have there. It's completely mature. You're about to ovulate. You have a very nice ovarian reserve. For now. - Please let me go. - I think you'll all thank me. One day, they won't notice you anymore. - Who? - The men. Now, breathe deeply... and relax completely. Because this will probably hurt a bit. No! There. That's it. Good girl! You'll feel a small pinch. Well done! Good job, Mia. There. That wasn't so bad, was it? Huh? 34A, you piss and shit in the bucket, not next to it. You finish your food and sleep between 10 PM and 7 AM. Hurry up! And you shut the hell up. Also when I'm not there. If you follow these simple rules, it'll be a lot easier. Hey! New girl. Did you arrive from the basement? Yes. Julie! You know we can't talk. Ignore her. Did you see other women when you were in the basement? Yes, I saw two others. Do you know what happens when they take us away? - I don't know anything. - New girl, be quiet. Didn't you hear him? - My name is Mia! - My name is Julie. The irritating one is Helena. That other one won't talk. - No, because she knows the rules. - My name is Elly. I know your name. You met my husband. Thomas Lindberg. - I'm really sorry about that. - He thinks he killed you. I was two months pregnant. Ruben said I'd be free if I did it. I was dumb enough to believe her. What did I just say? Are you complete morons? - Keep your mouth shut. - Unless I have permission to speak. Were you given permission to speak, 21B? Huh? - You're not too bright, are you? - I know. It's just because... It's just because... - My tooth really hurts. - You want me to help you? Stay still. Open wide. Open wide! Was that so hard? Why the hell can't you shut up? There... - What are you doing to her? - Shut up. I'm trying to concentrate! What a great job beating up a small woman! Huh? You're such a tough man, aren't you? Stand still! Not much of a talker anymore, are you? No! You only speak when spoken to! Stop it! Huh? - Are you pissing on my floor? - Her waters are breaking, you idiot! What's happening? My baby... What's happening to my baby? Get her on the couch. No. No! The heartbeat is nice and strong. This'll be a quick birth. Breathe. When you feel the urge to push, just push as hard as you can. It's crowning. Push. Come now. Push! One more episode like this, and there will be consequences. Got it? - Can't I hold him for a bit? No! - Let go! No, come back. Come back! No! Yeah? Does it have to be now? Yeah. Yeah. I'm on my way. What will it take for you to respect the rules? I love some resistance. Let her go. Let her go! Mia! Mia, take the keys. The keys! Where's my baby? I have to find my baby. This way! Over here! What a terrible smell! Don't look. I mean it, don't look! Don't! Do you hear him? It's my boy. Are you okay? It'll be all right. You're so strong. So strong. Mia? Free the others. Marker. Scalpel. - Give him to me now! - I'll kill him. - Stop, Elly! - I'll kill him! Hold him! Pull! It's okay, darling. Mummy's here now. Ruben! Aren't you coming out soon? Mia! - Thomas! - Mia? Where are you? Watch out, Thomas! He's here! What are you doing to him? I'll kill you! Thomas! What's going on? Let me out! Let me out, Thomas! Thomas. Thomas. What the hell are you looking at? Help him. Hey! There were no names in Ruben's records. But there were photos of influential men from all over the world. Strangely, it all vanished without a trace. A detective came by to question me a few days after we'd left the hospital. When I told him that I didn't know who had killed the Pig and the Dog - - and that Thomas hadn't known anything, he was out the door again. There was a reluctance to investigate the case fully. No one wanted to stir up anything. And yes, I did protect Thomas. I had a hundred reasons that are nobody's business. One of them was that he agreed to be Nika's dad. Even though she isn't really his child.
