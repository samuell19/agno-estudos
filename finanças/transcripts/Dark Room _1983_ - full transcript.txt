NIKKATSU Production Nikkatsu's 70th anniversary BLACK CHAMBER Based on the novel by Junnosuke Yoshiyuki Screenplay: Toshiro Ishido Camera: Shohei Ando Music: Teizo Matsumura Editing: Nobutaka Saya Koji Shimizu Author Rie Kimura Natsue Mayumi Miura Takako Yoshimi Ashikawa Maki Minoru Terada Yamanoi Yuki Kazamatsuri Keiko Director: Kirio Urayama Hotel Yamanoue "Past story" of Shuichi Nakada. I got married at a young age. At 23 years old, I was already married. One night, I got home early, I noticed a weird box on the table. A golden box with flower designs. What could it be? What is this? It's from Yamanoi. Yamanoi? When did he get here? Not too long ago. - Hi. - It's you? What brings you here? Your wife said you were coming home early. So, I waited for you. Your last novel is a hit. Speaking of which, I want to hear your opinion. They asked you to write for a magazine? Exactly. It's for a literary magazine. You didn't hesitate. But what would our colleagues say? It doesn't matter. If one of us becomes famous, we would all be proud. You think? I assume your article is ready. Indeed, it is. What time did Yamanoi really pass by? Around 3:30. He knows that I never come home that early. That's right. Did he try to seduce you? Answer me. So? I see. He seduced you. You have the worst imagination. Of course, I rejected his advances. Really? - I understand better now. - What do you mean? I know the reason why you were so aggressive in bed tonight. A box of candies... How unusual. If I insist on this box, it's because Yamanoi is known for both his lustfulness and greediness. In such a short time, Yamanoi... made a name for himself in the literature world. He was 23 years old, like me. The critique glorifies his style. The esthete Yamanoi was soon called "genius" and "prodigy". As for me, I was a simple journalist for a second rate magazine. One month after Yamanoi's visit, Keiko told me she was pregnant. I can't deny that when I first heard the news I thought there was a possibility that Yamanoi was the culprit. You need to get an abortion. I'm not making enough money with my current job. Our situation is uncertain. Very uncertain. You're right. This will be the third time. What is? You know it. Don't try to reopen an old wound. Ah, I see. This will be the third time. You are indifferent. Five years have passed. Keiko died in an accident. She crossed the road outside the crosswalk. I'm almost certain that it was not a suicide. For me it was an accident. That way I feel less guilty. I envy Yamanoi's success and wondered for five years if my wife cheated on me which has deeply affected me. By dying, Keiko freed herself from the pain that she was the mere shadow of her husband. I felt relieved too. However, I still have doubts sticking to me like old wounds. It's Nakada, the writer. Really? I didn't recognize him. he is seeing of our teacher Mrs. Ikebana. Really? It's you, Reiko? Wait. We can't do this. Not now. Stop. I still have a student. - Excuse me. - I'm sorry. You are extremely wet! It's normal. You made me wait for two weeks. You didn't have anyone else during that time? You always have negative thoughts. You know it well. My body only recognizes yours. After 168 times, it's normal. 168 times? That much? Yes, in three years. With today, it will be 169. Spend the night here for once. I'd like to, but... I spent two weeks at the hotel to write. I have to go back home to check my mails. Don't you have someone to take care of it? The other day, I phoned your home. I know, I've promised not to but... It was a woman who answered. It's my secretary. I hired her last year. Nakada, you are single right? I didn't tell you about her? Who is this secretary? You know... At home, I never play with fire. - Do you still need me? - No, that would be fine. - Go to sleep. - Yes. Good night. When I try to talk to you, you're always busy with work. It's not for pleasure. I have to finish this report for tomorrow. What's more important to you? Me or your work? Of course it's work. She doesn't know anything about men. New literature "Past story" of Shuichi Nakada. He insisted that I wake you up. - Is it Yamanoi? - Yes. What a surprise. It's me. It's been awhile. That's true. About 10 years. Did you read my last novel? Thank you. If you inspired me? You must be kidding. There's a difference between reality and fiction. You should know it well. Of course, I do know it. However, I didn't know you were into old stories. You should of thought of me. How about we get together for a drink? I have something that I want to ask you. If you propose a bar, It's probably because there are beautiful and cheap women there. Don't take it the wrong way. Sure. See you tonight. The man on the phone was Tsunoki. Noted. Does he still write novels? No, he failed an interview. Did you read my novel? Do you think the woman committed suicide or died in an accident? I don't know. You're not going to die anytime soon. Don't worry. Come with me. I can't today. - Next time. - Next time? There's a possibility that it might never happen. Then, let's go. We're meant for each other. We're meant for each other? One recognizes immediately someone with whom we have affinities. We are alike. That's what we call selective affinities. In that case, why did you make me wait? Why? Because I, was waiting for you in front of my house. Calm down. What's the matter? Can you hear me? Hey! Come. Come quick. You see? We are similar. That's right. Chief editor Toru Tsunoki It's a commercial magazine. I see. I want you to write serial novels. serial novels... I don't do serial novels... I knew you would refuse. It's not about novels or articles. Then, what is it about? A journal. I see. You have ideas. But, I have nothing to write about my private life. I sleep a lot and write a bit then call it a day. That's my daily routine. That is not going to work. You write erotic novels. or should I say "ero". What is the difference between "ero" and "erotism"? "Erotism" is an English word. Whereas, "ero" is Japanese. There's a big difference. I see. It's true that you're an expert. You have been single for the last 10 years. Is that right? You probably dated a few women during those years. - You want me to write about them? - Yes. I'm not interested. Those two women are inviting the both of you for drinks. It's hard to turn them down. Let's go. - Good evening. - Good evening. Nice to meet you. I'm sitting down. Is this the first time you meet this man? Yes. You have guts! Aren't you afraid? No, because we know him well. Did you hear that? They said they know you. Tell us about you. Who am I? There's not much to say. I write novels. That's about it. Younger girls feel more comfortable with a writer. This world has become that simple! Why the irony? I see him from time to time here. Who is this man? Do you mind if she switches place? He was never a chick magnet. Women never paid any attention to him. How old are you? 22 years old. You are my type. Now, he's very bold. And you, are you still chasing girls like before? Not that much. I used to attract a lot of women. Should we keep in touch? Sure. I will give you my phone number later. You're doing well. This is what we should of done at a younger age. I was aware. But young people are shy. But I was doing it. With Keiko, my wife? What are you talking about? Did you sleep with Keiko? Of course! You wrote it in your novel. Is it true? Are you mad? Of course not. You're lying. No. If only the dead could talk... Mitaka Hospital It's over. It's a common oppressive feeling. Soseki the novelist talks about it. in his novel "Through the window" The thumb keeps swelling under pressure. Or the ceiling keeps coming down. - Some kind of allergy? - I don't know. I don't think Soseki had an allergy. Will they find a cure for the allergy before I die? No, they'll find it the next day after my death. It will make the headlines on the news. You should go on a trip? - A trip? - Yes. Let yourself float across the landscapes. Today I'm a bit tired. I stayed in bed. Yes, probably a flu. You have the flu? Too bad. Take care of yourself. Thank you. Wait. I can make an effort. I always had a weak health. I can go. I want you. Say... Hello? Yes, it's me. Can you go out tonight? That is... I'm sick. It seems that you are. No... Stop! Natsue. You're seeing someone else. Who is it? Answer me! Stop! Maki came several times enquiring about you. They were lesbians? Yes. So, why does she come by herself? Good evening. You finally came. Long time no see. You're not scare on your own? Why? How about your friend? You mean Tsunoki? It doesn't matter. So don't ask me why I'm by myself. Could you keep an eye on the bar for 5 minutes? I'll go and fetch some olives. What are you going to do with olive oil? What are you talking about? Olives, not olive oil! Ah, I get it. You think too much. You're not in good terms with Tsunoki. You could tell that easily? You guys were constantly fighting. He gets on my nerves. In the past, he used to dominate you. But now the tables have turned around. At least, that's my opinion. That is exactly right. You're pretty quiet tonight. You are right. The other night you groped my breasts. I was drunk. Not that drunk. So, I'll do it again. Be careful, I'm might throw up. Sometimes men touch me. But you're the only one who touched me on the first date. And up until now. I had nausea every time. But with me you weren't feeling sick. You're right. It usually happens when I sit next to a man. How about now? Nothing. That is strange. That's why I wanted to see you, to understand what's happening to me. When was the last time you saw her? You mean, Maki? You know everything. Do you know why she became a lesbian? No. She was at the hotel with her lover. But he didn't do anything. In fact, he was gay. I see. One should not underestimate that terrible tragedy "the rape of a virgin" to make a big deal out of that dull love. The world is upside down. Boredom overcoming tragedy. That would be a good story for a novel. You should mention it in your interview today. So, you're not single. It's not like that. Too bad, she's beautiful. I don't want to make my life more difficult as it is. Let me explain. One day that girl came and questioned me about masturbation. She was working for a Cinema Magazine. But she quit to become a fashion journalist. Women always have such experiences. She's from a high income household. I felt hurt when she asked that question. So I hired her as my secretary a year ago. You're such a kind person. It is obvious that she is waiting for you every night. You know... Concubinage is not my thing. It's a sensible topic. To be honest, sometimes writers can have anxiety fits. For example, if you find a fly in your drink, What would you do? I wouldn't drink it. It would be great if the waiter noticed it. Otherwise, it's OK. I would show the fly around then finish my drink. I'm not refined enough to finish my drink discreetly. As a writer you lack finesse. By the way, since your sleep is restless you take sleeping pills every night? It's because I don't have a strong will. I can live without women, but not without sleeping pills. Why? Sleeping pills have no awareness. You wouldn't mind if all women were alike? With a body and no brains? Exactly. Sleeping pills bring satisfaction, without asking for anything in return. You should date an airhead, for a lasting relationship. So there's still hope in my life. You saved me. Men do not seek intelligence in women. The ideal woman would be one without a brain. Yes, that would be great. A woman with a body, but brainless. What's the matter with you? Where are you going? Enough with those crazies! Wait! What got into you? We're getting old. We should be careful. Shall we die on top of a woman? - What are you talking about? - You don't know? Watanabe died this morning. Watanabe died? Yes, at his mistress' place. He died while having sex. I packed the funeral clothes. Thank you. - I'll be back the day after tomorrow. - Understood. You can tag along if you want. In fact, I wanted to tell you, but... I... I'm considering marriage. No, I meant only... I was only asking if you wanted to come with me. I'm surprised. You want to get married. - Yes, but... - It's all right like that. It's a woman's dream. Nice weather. Tell me. Are you really single? It's like going on a honey moon. Does it scare you to hear this? Don't be silly. I read your last novel. The cause of your worries, is your wife's death? Am I right? The story is about a woman accepting marriage without having sex with her husband. - You know why? - I do. In her youth, she had a bad experience with her sex partner. She's traumatized. It's a Hitchcock movie. - So... - It was a boring movie. But in your case the trauma is less serious. You were already grown up. You heard about me? You'll get better. Heal from what? Because in my case, it's not a disease. What triggers your nausea? I'm pretty sure I have nothing against lesbians. A woman can have an orgasm while pleasuring her partner. Their hair entwined to become one. In a purple flow, they become a peach color liquid. Like a lake, it's a quiet world. Yes, that's it. Finally, you're as I imagined. One can't say it's not a disease. Still, admit you had side-effects. But... It's like a lake where water would not come. Thus the lake retains its original state. I understand. - Say. - What? That pure lake in your world, is it forbidden to men? Let's say they can't swim in it. But they can watch. I see. It's off limits. But they can observe it. You don't mind being ogled at? It depends on my partner's opinion. The bell is ringing The bell is ringing The path with a chestnut hedge the secret garden of lesbian love violated by a man... What is he more guilty of? Touching her mouth or her sex? That, is not a crime. - How about your lips? - One year in jail. A suspended sentence I hope! Good. I like the sex better. You know... I'm going to the United States soon. Now faster, easier to go on trips overseas. It's not a trip. I'm going to stay for 4 years. I'm going to study interior design. Really? Tell me... You really don't feel a thing? For a lesbian, a relationship with a man is not sexual. But you are all wet. Isn't it a risk? What? I mean... You could get pregnant. Don't worry. There's no risk today. I dont want children, I'd look silly if I got a lesbian pregnant? You'd be the hero of a comedy. Shut up now. You don't regret? No. Why? I don't know. Mr. Nakada. Hi, I'm Watanabe's uncle. My condolences. My nephew had a lot of respect for you. His dream was to be a writer like you. Well... However, I must tell you that his wife blames you for a bad influence on him. I'm sorry. Nakada... You never wanted a child? No, never. Really. If you want kids, you must believe that this world is beautiful. Otherwise it is recklessness or cruelty. If I understand correctly, you have no hope for the twenty-first century? None. Did you ever think about suicide? Truth be told, I've never thought about it. I should perhaps think about it... With you, a lesbian, I watch the sea. And I missed the funeral of my friend. Between words and deeds, what an abyss! It does not matter. Even Schopenhauer, was in favor of suicide. He traveled throughout Europe to escape cholera. You know... I think I live to an old age. Maki! I was afraid I'd miss you. So, this is the lake? Turn off the light! I am ashamed. What's wrong with you? Nothing. Nothing at all. It's good... It's good... It's good. And if I got married? Excuse me? This is really unexpected. Really? I waited for three years. Waited? But you knew it was impossible. Yes. You are right. I learned a few things about you. You're a cold person. A cold person... I was 26 when we met. I'm turning 30 this year. No, not yet. you still have 18 months before you turn 30. 18 months, it's almost tomorrow. A single 30 year old, this is frowned upon. By whom? By whom? By everyone. And you, Are you going to judge me? People always judged me. I get it. So you love someone. I have been proposed on numerous occassions. These last three years. But I refused each time. - I have to get married. - You have a someone in mind? Yes, and he's expecting my answer. You already slept with him? I saw her. Who? Your secretary. - A real beauty. - My secretary? You spoke to her? Of course, she told me everything. Everything? Did she tell you that we slept together? But of course. I have to go. Do as you wish. Listen to me. My high school boyfriend got married to Kayo at the village hall. Really? - Sir. - Yes? Why don't you marry Yumi? You're doing it on purpose? You're right, I should. Such a beautiful girl. Is it because of your age gap? If she did not live at home, perhaps I would have flirted with her. Really? - Yoshiko. - Yes? I beg you, don't get married. One day I might get married. I warned you. Get ready for the photograph. Hi. What's the matter? I didn't think I'd see you again. Why? Because... Should we go out? I don't want to. Stay here with me, please. Is he really in Hokkaido? Your "sugar daddy"... What is he doing in life? - Commercial. - What does he sell? Medical devices. Medical devices... Don't worry. He is far from here. But I must stay here because I'm expecting his call. What's new? What do you do every day? Nothing. - I'm rolling on the floor. -Really? As if I had no legs and no arms. Without legs or arms, what are you doing? Well... I stay locked in. I'm alone and I inflate a bag. A bag? You mean a part of your body? Yes, my body. But I don't know which. It's not very clear. It's a bag of purple color. That's right. I am quiet. The weather is good? It's not possible? No, I don't go out. You know I don't like eating out. Okay. See you. You used to have a more animal-like voice on the phone. Forgive me. Would you mind getting pregnant? If I'd mind? It is true that I would get in trouble but don't worry. Why? Because... I will go to the gynecologist. You know... when I get pregnant, I love it when... they snatched the fetus. I love this! I love it... I love it... You never considered marriage? No, never. I love sex too much. That's why I will never be considered normal by society. I understand. Once people get married, they can't do foolish things. You work in design? It's not really work. In fact, I don't like working. And I have no talent. To lie all day, suits me perfectly. You always lie in this cozy atmosphere? The candlelight give a quiet tone to the room. I perceive noises usually imperceptible. Maybe because I'm a country girl. "The Darkroom", Shuichi Nakada Yes? Excuse me. - I have brought you a drink. - Thank you. My successor is now ready. I'm giving you the day off. Ah, right? - It's okay? - Yes, of course. That's good. Thank you for everything. Thank you. See you later. - Yumi! - Yes? It's your wedding present. Take it, it makes me happy. It's not much, but... Thank you very much. You know... I will not go to the ceremony. I understand. I must ask your forgiveness. I lied to your friend, the Ikebana master... This is the past. Moreover, she ended up getting married. I'm sorry. This is the Moriya's residence. Nakada... Yes. I'm idling all day. I did not understand. These last three years, How many men did you sleep with excluding me? Maybe three? Don't say you don't have someone. You once used the excuse of "being tired" for not seeing me. You were with your future husband? No, it was not him. You ask me why? As expected... We were not made for each other. My voice? You understand me. I want to hear your voice one last time. Don't talk like that. No... I can't stand it... On the table, there is a vase. And inside... there are poppy flowers. And these flowers... have begun to fade as soon as I heard your voice. This is very troubling. Please. I want you to hang up. Nakada speaking. Hi, Maki! Air France? You're going to the airport? I see. What? I misunderstood. You're pregnant? What does that mean? Hello! I want to keep the child. Yes. What if I betray my lesbians friends? I don't think so. I'll make friends in New York as well. They'll take care of my baby. I want you to get an abortion. I have my say, too. Delay childbirth. No, delay your departure. Delay it, if you can. You get it? Don't go! - Still stuck in traffic. - Sir It woul dof been faster by train. The train for Narita Airport will depart soon. The train for Narita Airport will depart soon. Please be ready for departure. The train for Narita Airport will depart soon. Japan Airline final call to flight 65 departure for Los Angeles departing from gate 28. All customers please go to gate 28. The flight will depart soon. It's time. Don't keep the child. No. I will introduce the child to you in a few years. Wait quietly until that day. I don't want to see it. Too bad for you. I'm asking you to get an abortion. I've made up my mind and nobody can stop me. Plus... I'm not asking for child support. I'll take care of it on my own. Don't worry. Take care. Maki... Ah, women... Women! You are so cute. But can be troublesome! Bastard! It's your fault! - Stop it! - I'll kill you! You're a bastard! Stop it! Let's talk calmly. What happened to you? He knew that I wanted to leave him. So, he hit me. I thought he would kill me. As I ran away, I risked my life. You are hurt? No, it's just bad luck. It's small, here. Shall we go out? No. I'd rather stay. You took the doll and the candles when you left. Yes. Tell me. You don't make love like before. I felt a gentle, little arm pulling me towards the bottom of the uterus. It was good? It's the first time. You know... This means that... I became entirely yours. I'm sure. I plan to give you money regularly. I don't want it. The moving was expensive. And then you have no "sugar daddy". "sugar daddy"? I never used the word "sugar daddy" Yes, you did. Really? With him, it was not about money. So he was your lover. Not even. He was a tool. A tool for sex. For him, too? For the both of us. How did you meet him? He raped me. I rejected his advances. But he took me by force at the hotel. He did it because he thought it was consensual sex. Not at all. I only misunderstood his intentions. At the hotel, I struggled. But he was so brutal... - Like that? - No! This "no", has a similar meaning as the one at the hotel? And after a time, the "no" became "it's good". Yes. It's good, it's good! My buttocks wriggled with pleasure. Sir! Yes? What is it? It's fine, if you're still sleeping. I'm awake. I worked all night. You must be tired. Get out a little. Fresh air will do you good. Fresh air? I will not move from here until you finish your novel. It is an order from the publisher. "Fables of a prostitute" Shuichi Nakada Shoot! Ninomiya printing Sir. - Sir. - Yes! Make sure the tests are alright by three o'clock. It will be done. I feel that my heart is beating at an irregular rate. Stand still and breathe deeply. You will get better. It's all here? I'm sick of this guy "baby sitting" me. I haven't seen you in ten days. You were horny? How come? You know what I mean. You masturbated? I never do that. Really? But a nympho like you can really wait? You really think I can't? This is not a clear answer. You have changed. What did you do during these ten days? Why? This time I did not feel the small arms pulling me towards the bottom of the uterus.. I had sex once. With whom? Your ex? With a student. I see. You're not happy about it? Let's see... You read strange things. "Story of O". "In 1838, on the peaceful island of Barbados, a bloody riot broke out about 200 former black slaves men and women who had acquired their freedom were ordered by a law in March, to go beg their former master, a man named Glenelg, to take them back as a slaves." I... I'll be your sex slave. You will be my master, and I will always obey you. Fine. We will play master and slave. How do we proceed? I'll whip you. Lie on your back. Stop. Did it hurt? Yes, it hurts. They say the whip brings pleasure to the victim. Yes, a little bit. Did you enjoy it? I don't know. Since this is the first time I did not feel anything. But me... I am your slave. Do as you please with me. I'll be your faithful slave. I'll be your bitch. Very well. More importantly, don't forget to reward your slave. Do you understand? The reward... Yes. If one day you're tired of me, don't hesitate to tell me. And I'll go away. "The Dark Room", Shuichi Nakada Is that you? You look familiar. Yes! You're Nakada the novelist. It's me. Why? "Why"? "Why"? Novelists are also burglars? Yep. Bastard! Next time, I will kill you! Who are you? Yasuomi, don't bother our host. Do not hold grudges against him. My son is mentally handicapped. Please forgive us. Are you awake? Where am I? At my home, in the countryside. This is my little brother. He's 17, but acts like a child. When our mother dies, I will come back here and look after him. This boy, is a bit like my child. I see. I've never imagined that one day I would bring you here. When you fainted, I called a cab to bring you home. But in the cab, I changed my mind. I'm glad that you're here. My mother is still healthy, but me... I don't want to go back to Tokyo. I'll stay here. You'll stay? Farewell. There is a bus stop not too far away. You still have time. Please go. Go away! OK, Yasuomi? Farewell! Forgive me.
