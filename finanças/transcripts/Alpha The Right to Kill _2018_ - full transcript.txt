Half kilo. - Here, sir. - What's with him? Caught in the act... Selling crack. - Quite a lot. These from you? - No, sir! I'm just earning a living. - These aren't yours? - They were planted.

Wait a minute. Come with me. Right hand. Elijah. Get your cut from Chief's secretary. Where's Chief? On his way. - The others? - Inside. Let's go. Sir. Okay.

Logistics? - Yes, sir! - DEU is here? - Yes, sir! - Investigation? - Yes, sir! - And SWAT? - Yes, sir. All right. Let's begin. All the information we got from our intel... - Here they are. - All right. He's the leading pusher in the area. Name is Abel. He deals bundles in that area. He spreads them within the vicinity. He's the main player here. - Do we have his dossier? - Yes, sir. He's Norman Bautista, aka Abel. Wanted for murder and illegal possession of firearms in Tacloban. Here, sir. - Have we got the warrant? - Yes, sir. Through E-mail. If you look at this place... Those are his henchmen. Those are the users... Look! The whole neighborhood. Profits from Abel's setup. They sell foils. No longer a livelihood, but a cottage industry. Correct, sir. It's irritating to see this being done openly. Is everyone in the area involved? Let me make this clear before proceeding to the main point. Sir, along this alley, apartments are cramped together and turned into drug dens. At the center is our target's apartment. Okay, SWAT I want to hear from you. What's our assault strategy? Sir, if you look at the area, there's an estuary which leads to the target. It will be our point of entry to avoid CCTVs and lookouts. We'll go in first, the intel will follow. Before we sneak in, we verify if the target is in the area. Moises, if he's there, call me. If not, text me so we can abort the mission. - Yes, sir! - Okay. - Whose alpha is this? - Mine, sir. - What's his name? - Elijah, sir. The newly hired janitor. Okay. Nobody will fall without my express permission. Is that clear? - Yes, sir! - Good! Good luck! Dismissed! Good work! Moises, here's the marked money. - Where's Elijah? - Downstairs. This is the big-time operation. Do your best, okay? Here's the marked money. - Don't fuck up. - Yes, sir. Go. Your team leader shall take care of you, okay? We do this for the country and for the next generations. - Is that clear? - Yes, sir! Hey, bro. Take a shot. - Where're you going? - To Sir Abel. Ciggie. - How are things? - All good.

Fucking shit! Help me out, asshole! Let's go! Boss, Abel's at the rooftops. He is? Clear! Pull out! Stop! Get down! If you can't afford, the government will provide you one. Move it! We haven't done anything wrong, sir! Everyone, come down. Get down! Move it! Stand back! Move back! My husband! Let go of me! What have they done? Fucking shit! Elijah, where have you been? At the police station, going home. - Alone? - Yeah. - Okay. - Thank you, sir. Go ahead. Thank you, sir. I'm off here. - My fare. - Thank you, sir! That fucker! - What's up? - Nothing, sir. Place the bag here. Open it. - You didn't mess with it? - No, sir. Everything's in there. - All intact? - Yes. Don't fuck with me or you'll get it. Put the money inside my bag. Yes, sir. Get my other bag. Open it. - Here. Turn that into money. - Yes, sir. Okay, get off. - Where's Chief? - Upstairs, sir. - What's with him? - He stoned a car at Boni. - I didn't... - You're a pest! What do you want? Want me to lock you up? Sir, forgive me, please! I'll return what I stole... - Please, sir, my kids... - Shut the fuck up! Isn't it your second time here? - Name? - Joseph, sir. - Last name? - Cruz. - Middle name? - Lim. - How old are you? - Twenty. - From? - San Miguel. Stand up. You guys, stand up! Come here. Buddy, bring them inside. Sit down, Sergeant. - You guys did this operation? - Yes, sir. What happened? At four in the afternoon, I got the call from my confidential informant. I called my team leader, SP04 Rodel Cruz, we coordinated with the SWAT team. We staged a buy-bust operation. I was with the poseur-buyer. - You were the poseur-buyer? - No, his lookout. I learned from my Alpha that Abel was there and his drug activities were positive. I immediately left and sent signals to our team leader to stage the operation. Alright. I'll just fix this a little, Sergeant. Get it back tomorrow, so we can inquest the suspects. - Okay, sir. - This is good. Alright. Hello? The target's dead. - You saw him? - Yeah, at the apartments. Okay, thank you. Media people, you can field your questions now. Sir, who was the target at the San Miguel operation? The target was Abel Bautista suspected big-time pusher. He's got an outstanding warrant of arrest in Tacloban. How many were killed during the operation? Ten, based on initial reports. Including the main target. Sir, were human rights violations committed at the operation? None at all. The enemies were heavily armed, but I can assure you the police protect the rights of citizens in the war against prohibited drugs. Are you planning to stage a follow-up operation? I've given instructions already. There will be, but we can't discuss it yet at the moment. There were twenty accused and were picked up in Mandaluyong, is this true? Ten died during the incident. We made no other arrests. So, you're saying that the twenty were armed? Excuse me. Be truthful with the facts. Only ten were killed, including the main target. No other suspects were apprehended. I don't know where you got twenty. Let's be careful. Let's be factual with our figures. Sir, how about the international community condemning the killings? That's a very delicate subject. Me and my colleagues here, we're trying to do our best job. To be professional, and to do it by the book, to protect human rights. I want to assure you that. You can write that, you can quote me. Anything more? - Nothing more, sir. - Thank you very much. Thanks you very much. - Sir, let's take a break. - Yes, brother. Thank you! We're good, bro. Finally, we can go home. We got everything right? - I'll go now. - Okay, sir. Have you eaten already? Have you eaten? How was the operation? - It was fine. - You look tired. - I cooked your favorite. - I'm good. Let's take a rest. How're the kids? - Are they asleep? - Yes. Okay. I'll take off my shoes. Don't make too much noise. - They've been asleep for long? - Yeah, they're exhausted. They'll get mad at you again. You didn't attend their Christmas program. You know my work, honey. You'll wake them up. Let's go. - You go ahead. - You said you're tired. - I'll follow. - Don't be noisy, okay? She's been crying nonstop. She'll end up with gas pains. - Her milk is used up. - Stop crying. Poor baby. Our fan's broken. Let me have her. Let's get some fresh air. Drink your milk. Drink your milk, baby. - Someone's at the door. - Anybody home? - Who is it? - Dante. Come in! Bro! What's up? How have you been? Look what I've got! - Wow, birds! Look, baby! - Birds! Bro, how are things doing? Have the two packs been delivered? I split them into four. - Two packs, right? - Yeah. I just split them into four. Secure it well. Pack it nice. The buyer will be pleased. I'll tighten it. Okay, there're four of them. Okay. Good! In that direction. The birds are gone! I'll get the payment. Don't take too long. Bye! - Sir. - Where are your pigeons? We've released them. We use them for racing contests. Okay. Let me check you. - How about you? - I'm with him. Check him. - Are we good? - Let's go. L16, where are you now? Bring us near the chapel. Our primary target Abel Bautista has been positively identified. Also killed, Paolo Mataverde and Israel Lazaro. Good afternoon, sir. We'll report about the operation. Okay, sit down. How did you identify the suspect? Through his ID card, sir, from his wallet recovered from the crime scene. Aside from the dead, how many arrests did you make? We apprehended ten, sir. The first respondents caught them in the act. - During the raid? - Yes, sir. - Where's the evidence? - Here, sir. Twenty sachets of meth at the crime scene. Proven positive by the crime lab. The one with the initials AWB was recovered from Abel's gangplank. Others were from the suspects. Where's the bag? What bag, sir? Can't you see? It's clear as day. Sir, we saw no bag at the crime scene, We only recovered a .45 caliber pistol and bullet shells. Sir, someone must have gotten there first. Where were you during the gunfight? Sir, I secured my alpha. Then I lead the first respondents to the target. This means only two things: We're either thieves or a bunch of idiots. I don't know how you will recover that bag. If I discover who's behind it, I'll personally blow his head up. Dismissed. Fix this. - Sir, I have to go. - Go ahead. Okay, go. You? - I just live nearby. - Put it down. We need to inspect it. Just a routine check. Are we okay? Sorry for the bother. It's difficult here. Pretty strict. Yours is ugly. - Can it fly fast? - Want them to race? There's my rooftop. We turn left, and we'll be there. I've got more pigeons up there. Bro! - Have they arrived? - Yeah, upstairs. - You can go up now. - What's up, bro? We're good, we go upstairs now. Hopefully they're all in. Set it down. Com'on. - Dante, the two are already here. - Yeah? - The others aren't in yet. - Let's take the ice. The others haven't arrived yet. Help me remove it.

How about the international Community? They are condemn the killings. You can't stop the police momentum against the war on drugs. They have to do what they have to do, even if it means casualties.
