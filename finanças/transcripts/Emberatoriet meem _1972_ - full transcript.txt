Yes, today You'd better not have told them No, Ma'am, you didn't even say when Alright Yes? She's coming now? Right now? Bless you, Omran. I'll reward you for this Get up! The boss is coming right now What an unlucky day Go put on your white coat I don't have one Hide in the bathroom or something She's a dictator, really fussy! Abdel Hamid, Take me to the Happy Future School in Shubra You said Al-Nagah I've changed my mind. Take me to Shubra - Welcome, Madam - Enjoying this chaos? Madam, you know what the situation's like There's a shortage of teachers; classrooms made for 30 students hold more than 60; we can't afford to rebuild crumbling walls Please, Madam - Let's go, driver - Please.. Now you can take me to Al-Nagah School - Welcome, Madam - Call the headmistress - Come in, Madam - Call the headmistress I said Yes - Welcome, Madam - Hello I let you know I was coming so you could clean up the school - and get on with teaching I'm certain you've done just that I'll pay my visit tomorrow or after.. Or the day after Thank you. Let's go, driver We've been arguing the matter for almost two years Those before us spent 20 years discussing it The level of education, the state of the students, exam policies.. We won't reach a solution Those in the ministry think with their imaginations, they lay down projects on paper They don't live with the students or teachers We can't solve a problem if we don't experience it - She's very hot-tempered today - She has a right to be This meeting, as is the case with all our meetings is mere routine, playacting I'm going to submit a suggestion to the minister - that we spend our days in the schools We'll come to the ministry in the afternoons after we experienced what we will discuss That won't do, Mamdouh Playing ball at school, at the club and at home, too? At school I communicate with my classmates through the ball At the club I communicate with friends through the ball and at home I communicate with myself So I'm banging it here Ball isn't a game, Mum, it's a language Even the ball has a philosophy! Wash your hands and let's have lunch Come here! Get the ball with you Satisfied? Is that the ball talking? Or did it break the glass in a demonstration? No more playing ball in the house.. Come Get rid of this ball, I don't want to see it again Yes Do you think you solved the problem that way? It's not solved Aziza.. Yes, Ma'am? - Is lunch ready? - Not yet, it's on the grill - Hurry up, then - Alright Madiha.. what's that in your mouth? Don't worry, it's not filled with tobacco That's not the point. I've never seen a girl with a pipe If I decide to smoke I'll smoke a pipe Pipes are for men, dear Only men smoke them There's no difference between men and women. That was in the past In the past, present and future, and until the Judgement Day women will be women and men will be men You mean sex, right? There's a difference in sex But what's the pipe got to do with that? Will smoking a pipe change my sex? Why doesn't smoking cigarettes change it - although men smoke cigarettes? Enough, dear To convince you I'd have to give birth to you anew You're driving me nuts You're home, Mum For quite a while. Were you brushing your teeth? You're always so clean, dear and you always spray your room. I'm proud of you - Thanks, Mum - Come eat lunch Maha, lunch is ready What's this mess? Listen to these verses, Mum Your heart has driven Cupid to madness He now shares my suffering and sadness He'll depart this world because of you And cry with me.. This isn't the time for that Cupid, the god of love You need the god of success now You've no time to waste on such nonsense I've never failed exams and I never will These sweet love stories encourage me to study Enough sweet-talk, get serious Don't upset yourself Where will you play then, not at the neighbours? She was wrong - Welcome home, Mum - Thanks - When did you arrive? - In the morning What're you doing here? I said to wash your hands But Mum.. No buts. Go wash your hands Why are you yelling at him? Each time you have problems at work you take it out on the kids It's not their fault That's why I can't bear to stay here more than a week, because of your constant yelling at the kids I'm both mother and father in this house I have to be strict with them And they must obey me I'm your mother and you must obey me Your constant yelling will only make them more obstinate Treat them gently, not with yelling and screaming, understand? You're shouting at me too And why not? Too big for me Never, Mother. Enough yelling, let's have lunch You've gotten old, Madam It's you who make yourself feel old and gray I'm thankful The ministry and kids could've done worse to me Do the ministry and kids - tell you wear those drab clothes? Why don't you wear your bright dresses? They brighten you and make you look gorgeous What gorgeous? Yes, gorgeous Stop whistling, Mahmoud, we're at the table The noise you make with your guitar is enough Now, now.. I love dolma, especially when made by Cook Gomaa Delicious! Not really; I used to make it a hundred times better There's nothing like a woman's cooking If I had a cook - I wouldn't let him do anything He'll only assist But today.. The woman gets up and runs out the house, leaving so and so to take care of the food, so and so to watch the kids, and you clean the house Why is Mustafa so late? Enough speeches and talk We need to take action The aims are clear. We must build ourselves and fight Build first or fight? Both together We can't build unless we gain freedom What about us? Shall we stand aside and cheer? No, just marry us - Mum, I want 120 piasters - I'm going upstairs to rest I want 120 piasters What for? - To buy a book - A novel, of course? A new novel, it's really good No. And give me that one, too >From now on I only want to see you reading school books This is impossible I'm not a child for you to treat me like this I'm going to read novels, so let's stay friends I am your friend But I'm your mother, too A friend will go along with you, whereas your mother will look to your interests You're chain-smoking, Mum She annoyed me So cigarettes calm people down when irritated? Cigarettes are useless It's just a bad habit So when one gets used to it he can't stop? What are you getting at? Nothing - Nabil - The band Lunatics Hello Yes, she's in Who's calling? Mum! It's for you It's Dr Enayat Hello, Enayat I miss you too Tonight? I'd love to come It's a chance to get out of this madhouse You say that every time and don't come Don't go back on your word, we're expecting you Good evening, Mum - Good evening, dear - Where to? I have a dinner invitation at Enayat's Who'll be there? Why all the questions? It's I who should do the asking Where have you been till now? Out I know that, but out where? I have the right to go where I please I have the right to know where you were You can ask but I don't have to answer - I'm your mother! - So what? I'm responsible for you and must know where you go So you can prevent my going out? Yes, I can That's dictatorship. Where's the freedom you're always talking about? What am I to do with you! Should I take this bag or this? That one's not suitable for your age, it's for a girl Think me old, boy? I'm younger than you Mahmoud, change the tune so I can dance Don't dance And you stop playing guitar Guitar in the morning and at night, before and after meals - Give me that guitar! - What use is a guitar? It's for you to shut up and listen. Give it here! Stop it.. What's with you? I told you to stop that I want you to study and no nonsense And go to bed early I missed you. Can I kiss you? Certainly Mustafa, we must find a way to deal with Mum I can't take it Today I asked for money to buy a book and she refused That is a problem Just one? It's a lot of problems When Mum doesn't give you money to buy a book - it means she controls us because she controls the capital.. The money You need money for everything, even playing ball - And the guitar - And cigarettes And the solution? To liberate ourselves from the capital Freedom can only begin by liberation from the capital Capital is everything Even the government controls us through capital They fire whom they please and deprive him of money and give raises to whom they please Mum and the government are one Should we demonstrate? No Demonstrations are not legitimate - nor constructive; just a means to voice opinion Mum knows our opinion without us demonstrating What to do, then? We'll do without the capital We'll make a communal library at home and put the books we want to read in it - How? - Yes, how? Each one of us will contribute 10 or 20 piasters and we'll have a monthly sum amounting to 60 or 120 piasters We'll buy a new book each month - Who'll choose the books? - We'll take turns You'll choose this month, then Madiha, then Medhat No, I'll choose first. I inspired the project Alright, you'll be first -I'm next - Be quiet I can't afford to pay 20 piasters Buy two cigarettes instead of a pack Shut up We'll each pay 10% of our allowance. What do you say? - Agreed - Me too - Starting next month? -Yes Yes, let's start Where to? To meet the band You're going out without Mum's permission? Why not? Shouldn't we liberate ourselves? The cake has arrived Help yourselves.. Welcome.. Smile Smile, please.. the photo's ruined What, am I a new bridegroom? Who could object to that? I don't mind, on condition I get a new bride You're stuck with me It's all thanks to you I want you always by my side May you always be together I'm angry at you, Enayat You should've told me so I could bring a gift Really, Mona! Well, it's enough to see you Here, Madam Thank you, I have a piece already Would you like a glass of champagne? No, thank you Hello.. Where have you been? Long time no see, Mona I spend most of my time at home with the kids How pretty you look! Very chic, too Come, now! I'm going to get some pastries My husband's completely forgotten me Thank you I forgot to introduce you Ahmed Raafat, businessman, - Mrs. Mona Hamed - Hello Please come to the table My husband prefers to eat my cooking Once I hired a cook and he noticed the difference Now I know why he loves me so much The best way to a man's heart is through his stomach Not true; that was in the past Right, Mona? Today, the best way to a man's heart is through his mind Sometimes Men like to think of their work without interference from us Does love last after marriage? You're right. in a year or two love becomes like a telephone - Meaning? - The line goes dead Impossible Every couple needs time apart from each other How? She must allow him to spend the evening alone Would you allow your wife that? See? He's scratching his head He'd never allow such a thing Why not? This lady is out for the evening alone I'm a widow How is it that we never met before? I frequently go to the ministry where you work We may have met I've never met such a pretty elegant director Thank you. Excuse me - Why are you still up? - I couldn't sleep Try and sleep, dear Where have you been? How dare you go out without permission? I was studying with a friend. You weren't here Studying with the guitar? Well, tomorrow's a holiday Listen.. No more going out without my permission, understood? You treat me like a child Where's the freedom you talk about? Freedom doesn't mean bumming around till one in the morning To earn freedom - you must have a sense of responsibility And your responsibility now is to study Go up to bed We've made a decision concerning a certain project What is it? We've decided to start a communal library A wonderful idea I'm ready to join you No, sorry Why not? The aim is liberation from capital And you're the capital If you join you'll be a center of power We don't want centers of power You're killing me with your big words Politics has muddled your brain I don't know why I let you go to law school Play Let her join. We can take her money and buy what we want When you're older you'll know that whoever pays more - does what he pleases That's what centers of power mean It's better I don't join But suppose you buy a book I won't allow? You've no right Don't start with your impudence Come on now, what happened to freedom of expression? Any books you don't allow we'll read secretly Meaning what? If you buy a book on sex I'm to allow it in the house? Any book is knowledge; we're grown-ups We look out for each other just as you look out for us We'll start with sex books - What's a sex book? - Shut up I don't agree. Besides, you should be studying You should be reading school and college books only Is studying a punishment? We always pass our exams, don't worry I won't allow it We can implement the project in three ways Either you be convinced or we can wheedle you into agreeing Yes? Or we can do it behind your back, buy the books and read them in secret Which do you choose? You're beaten, sir. Checkmate I choose none of them, so stop giving me a headache Mum! A telegram! Mum! A telegram! Who's it from, Mum? Go play with your brothers Arriving Saturday evening on Egypt Air Hope to see you at the airport Ahmed You won't even allow me to kiss your hand! Not yet You're impossible. We've been seeing each other for years You live in the 18th century! Your great-grandmother would've agreed by now A kiss has no meaning unless preceded with conviction I'm not convinced yet The children again, right? Life isn't sacrificing yourself for your children or they sacrificing themselves for you It's living together, supporting each other - to make your lives complete And your life is incomplete I can't believe you don't want to marry The kids will grow up and have their own homes and you'll be alone You'll be left to beg them for love and attention One night at Mustafa's place, another at Mamdouh's, or at at Madiha's.. You'll find them busy with their own problems - with no time for their mother's A mother must have a home and a husband, and be independent I'm ready to talk to the kids - What will you tell them? - I'll ask for your hand What can I do? Anything to get married The problem isn't just the kids It's me, too Everything you say makes sense But I can only marry with my heart and mind You know you own my heart But my mind isn't big enough for both you and the children I need you, Mona I can never settle down without you Bear with me, please Bear with me till I'm able to come to a decision Try to reach a decision before I return from my next trip I need you I can never settle down without you Aziza.. Where's the telephone? Mahmoud, I need the phone Just a minute, Mum Let's hang up. I'll meet you when I get back from school Come here Take this dress to be pressed - I want it this afternoon - Alright - Where's the phone? - Madiha took it Why didn't you come to the lecture? - I want the phone - Just a minute, Mum I'm revising the lecture with my boyfriend Don't say boyfriend, say colleague, and hurry up What time will you be at the lecture hall? Where's the phone? - Maha took it - Where's Maha? Yes, Nabil - The phone, Maha - Alright, just a minute No, hang up Might as well buy everyone in this house their own phone That means 7 phones! Let's not eat or drink, and talk on phones instead I'll call you later, Nabil Hang up! Egypt Air? What time does today's flight from Geneva arrive? Flight 810 At 8:30. Thank you - Done with the phone, Mum? - No Go get dressed Close the door Abdou, I want to get my hair done today At around 4 pm I can't come in the morning, you know I go to work Yes, around 4 Thank you - Good morning - Good morning Good morning, darling - Morning, Mum - Morning Good morning - That's more like it - Pleased with me? Of course Why are the windows closed? It's a lovely day Hope it stays fine so we don't have to close them again I'll have to go without Mahmoud, he's not ready - Hurry him up - I tried He's free as long as freedom isn't at the expense of others There's only one car, we're all ready Good morning What's that you're wearing? Do you forget you're a girl? You should wear girls' clothes I'm neither girl or boy, I'm a human being We say the race of human beings These clothes aren't for school, they're for the beach You're driving me nuts Don't upset her. It was a relief to see her in a good mood What to do? One goes right and the other goes left There's no left or right at school, only independent character Freedom starts with an independent character Stop philosophizing and go put on something else Comb your hair And you, Maha, change those boots Or I swear you're all grounded on Friday I'm late. Bye, Mum Morning Morning, Abdullah If we don't rehearse today we're done for The party's tomorrow. The whole gang's waiting to rehearse The club hall is busy, at school it's not allowed We'd rehearse at Aly's but his dad kicked him out We'll rehearse, even if we have to do it in the street I'll call you in a while Bye Mum, remember Mrs Moushira? Dr Ezzat's wife? Yes A relative of hers received a marriage proposal But she's hesitant He's a very good man, around 45, 48 years old.. A businessman How old is she? Around 39, 40.. Wow! She's old! If she loves him she should marry Love has nothing to do with age She's free People are free to do as they please A week ago I visited a school It was a surprise visit.. oh, what I saw! The school that was expecting me - was in perfect order Nothing gets done unless one goes and sees to it Not just in schools, but everywhere, there's only one official He relieves others of responsibility and makes them lax Even in the streets If an official is passing through a street it gets cleaned and paved The streets he doesn't pass through Would be full of potholes and trash There's no planning, no principles, only lies Employees lie to their bosses, the bosses lie to their bosses All the talk and reports are lies Must you comment on everything I say with a speech? Even in our homes, Mum You think you're the only one responsible You don't see that each one of us can be responsible for himself It's a shared responsibility Life's like a soccer match One can't score a goal - without the help of the whole team - But they must play well - That's the problem Who can judge if they play well or not? The catastrophe is that only one is allowed to judge, and say whether it's good or not Enough! Must I listen to arguments at the ministry - and at home, too? I haven't had my turn yet Postpone it, I'm going out. I have work Really? Will you be home late? Yes, around 9 or 10 I want to come home and find you studying That's responsibility We have to finish rehearsing - before Mum comes home at 9 We've been meeting in the street for a year I wait for you at the school gate and walk you home or we meet at the club and sit amongst others I long to be with you in a closed place so we can talk in private I want to feel we're not hiding I don't want to hold your hand in secret, but freely I also wanted to ask you to my house But I'm afraid.. Mum and my brothers.. My place, then. We can listen to music and dance, talk, have tea - But you must behave - I'm on my best behaviour at home Medhat Yes? Are you going out too? You're all going out and leaving me alone! Why am I here, then? I have to go to Aly's house to study Go ahead, then I'm going to quit. Mum caught me stealing her cigarettes They still treat us like children And my mum calls me Lulu! Me, Lulu! Here you are Want a sip, Souad? A sip for you and one for me Oh! If my mistress finds out she'd kill me I have to account for even a sip of water Leave her alone, Medhat. Each to his own maid Mum won't employ anyone but Aziza Come here What's this you're doing at home? It's a rehearsal, Mum Since when do you rehearse at home? - We had nowhere else - Why didn't you tell me? You wouldn't have agreed You thought I was going to the hairdresser, - and I was going to stay out late - Right Tell your band to leave. That's enough We can't Mum, we have to finish Let us finish, the party's tomorrow Don't embarrass me in front of my friends Alright. Finish while I watch You go ahead, Mum No. In front of me Let's continue, guys Aziza Did you pick up my dress from the cleaner's? - Yes, Mistress - Where's Madiha? - Out - And Maha? - Out - And Medhat? No one's home except Mustafa, he's studying They thought I wasn't coming straight home - Where's Mum? - In her room This is indecency! This is not a home, it's a nightclub! Please, Mum, stay with the kids I have an appointment I won't, I don't like this nonsense. I'm leaving I can't take such goings-on; it's like a nightclub! I beg you, this is not the time Stay with the kids You stay with them; didn't you raise them to do what they please? It's your fault, so deal with it I'm going to stay with my brother for a few days You don't feel comfortable there, you dislike his wife Then I'll go home Why stay alone when you can be with us? I'm alone here, too. Nobody bothers about me Sir.. Yes? I'm going to buy some tea, need anything else? - Don't be long - Alright I'm late. I have to go home Mum's waiting for me I'll walk you to the door No, stay and study Medhat? Oh! I'm telling your mother I did nothing And you.. It's not my fault Even kids! What a generation! Where were you? I was at the rowing club You were rowing till 7:30 ? I walked home from the club with my friends And who are these friends? Boys, girls.. They're my friends, so stop it, Mum! Why didn't you say you were going out? Did you think I wouldn't be back? You weren't here, so I couldn't tell you Listen, no more going to clubs I wonder what club Maha went to? Your flat is nice Thank you Have a seat Want to see my life history? I'm more interested in your future If you'd met me when I was younger you'd have still loved me I'd have waited for you to grow up and see whether you were worth it - I've grown up - And you're worth it You know, for a year - I've wanted to kiss you I don't want to kiss you just because we're alone but because you too want me to kiss you Now I really feel you're mine Nabil.. I wonder where Maha is? Enough, enough! - A little while more, Mum - No more! Stop, for my sake I can't take it Let's continue tomorrow I'm sorry Where were you all this time? I was with Nabil Talk to me properly. Where did you go? To his place, to listen to music Good God! At his place? You shouldn't have done that They're my friends Your friends are crap and you're crap! You're maddening me! Each of you wants to do as he pleases! I'm killing myself for you! I stay locked up at home - and kill myself for you You're all conspiring against me People have kids to bring them joy - but you make me sick Nothing satisfies you I don't know what to do to make you happy Damn you all' Running a disco in my house! You make me lose control of my senses Can't I go out in peace for once? I can't have a good time Mona? How could you not meet me? I'm sorry, I couldn't No, I'm not ill My voice is a little hoarse Later, later Call us when you guys get home Good bye What? Why so quiet? Talk Talk, don't be afraid Why? So I can get slapped again? Mum never hit me before Nobody ever hit me before What can I say after she smashed my guitar? You forced me to do that You have no right to do so I have the right to hit you if you do something wrong - No - I'm your mother You had no hand in that, any woman can become a mother "Such is my father's crime; I've harmed no one" We're not discussing your motherhood We want to discuss the authoritative power here, the authority of giving orders How could you break my guitar? I've the right to break it over your head if I don't like your behaviour I'm the head of this household I'm the one who works and struggles to earn the money you live on That's not reason enough for you to control us If we follow the logic of breadwinner equals boss - I might as well find another mother - richer than you, and let her support me and run my life If I'm not to be in charge of running your lives - I have the right to not support you No you don't. You don't support us of your own free will Society and the law decree that you do so Nobody answer the phone. Sit down It's love, Mustafa I gave no thought to society or law when I bought you those clothes - I bought them out of love - Love's a capitalist emotion It's an excuse for dictatorship Any dictator can do as he likes and tell his people he loves them; he only loves himself I don't buy you anything does that mean I don't love you? No one understands what love is - You shut up - We all love you But we don't run your life You don't love me You forget how hard I work and struggle We all work Society's need for your work is no less than its need for ours You work at the ministry, we achieve learning at college The government pays your salary So you can provide for us You benefit, but what do I gain? The individual shouldn't benefit alone He must benefit society as a whole You gain something, Mum.. Personal pleasure - What pleasure? - Your joy in us You want an empire you can be proud of M, M, M.. all our names start with M Did you ask us what we thought of M? Nobody answer. Sit down What do you want? We want democracy - Pardon? - Democracy in management Who should run this house? - Me, of course - No - You, I suppose - Not me The popular platform, meaning elections Democracy is elections The family will elect the person to run this house - It'll be every two years - And have a list of duties Crazy talk! You've all gone nuts The things you read and hear have muddled your brains I know who I'm going to vote for I have demands, whoever we elect must meet them And what are your demands, sir? Me? To have elections Let's try it, Mum. It's a new idea Please say yes, Mum - For my sake, Mum - And if I refuse? You'd be undemocratic then we'll enlist the popular platform You teach these things in schools, Mum - Please, Mum - Alright, alright! Wait, I'll answer it Alright; but after elections things will change Where are you, Mona? I called you nonstop I'm very sorry, Ahmed The kids are driving me crazy We're both victims If I were the only victim I would forgive you What I can't forgive or stand for - is that you victimize yourself What can I do? When you're away I wait for you When you're here I'm unable to see you Unable or don't want to? You know.. How can I no matter how much I want to? They're 6 kids, Ahmed, 6 problems I live for them and live with them And I'm problem number 7 You were never a problem because you bear with me and understand me You don't know what I went through to meet you at the airport - What? - I went to the hairdresser.. Is that all? There's more.. I'll call you later I'll call you guys early tomorrow I know who was on the phone They must've told you what happened I'll tell you everything When I finished studying with Aly I took the elevator .. she got in with me Who? Their maid, Souad The elevator was empty She looked at me and smiled She came closer and grabbed me.. And kissed me. That's what happened Have you grown up so much? Mustafa, Mustafa.. Come here Listen to your brother's story Deal with it and come tell me what you did There, carry the responsibility Mahmoud.. Give me the phone, I want it - Morning, Mum - Morning We've decided to hold the elections in 5 days, next Friday We have to get ready What do you mean? Election campaigns.

Yes, Mum Are you done, Mum? Here I'm the only one who has no right to use the phone Do you want the phone?

You want the truth? -Yes - To meet Nabil - Where will you go? - I don't know yet Do you know where I want you to see him? Here at home, amidst your siblings Really? I can see him here? -Yes - And where are you going? Out. I won't be late Nabil, listen.. Come to our house Don't be afraid, Mum said you could - Who's this Nabil? - Not your business Mum allowed it If he comes here I'll break his leg - You can't..give - I won't allow it It's not your business None of your business.. Mum! At last, I get to see you It's been two days - I've missed you - Me too How long till we keep meeting like this? It's either a park, my car or the desert Why can't we have a home? That's always been our problem We'll never have a home for just the two of us The kids will always be with us Open the subject with them Someday each of them will have his own home They have to know We've nothing shameful to hide What's between us isn't shameful but we're unable to achieve it I know what I want You don't That's enough You're right. You've waited too long, humored me a lot I don't deserve your great love I can't give you all of myself Meaning you and the children? I love you and the children Perhaps if you didn't have any children - I wouldn't have loved you as much That's fantasy. The reality is - you'll find me living with you with a third of myself I'll be divided between you work, and the kids When I should be with you totally I'll be with you everywhere When you're with the children, at the ministry, and now Love isn't just two persons It's their whole world Will you be with me during elections? Elections? Don't tell me you're running Not me. The kids decided to hold elections at home to elect a board and a chairman in order to do without me - Seriously? - Seriously - And you agreed? -I agreed They must be joking I don't know I don't know if they're joking or serious I'm so confused You make me even more so I've been confused since the day we met I fear it's my confusion that makes me short-tempered And that caused the kids to turn against me - and come up with this election thing The only way to end your confusion is to accept Mona.. Say you accept I will but not now I have to leave now When will I see you again and where? At home.. my home Come meet the kids and let's see what happens No individual problems Those with individual problems are responsible for them We're confident they'll manage as long as he doesn't do so at the expense of others But I can't solve my problem And you can't solve it for me You must live the experience till the end Do as you please till you learn from it Listen, Abdou.. sit Tomorrow when you set the table, add chairs for all of you That means that you too, you and Aziza will join us too and Hassanein too We're all of one class We live together and eat together as they do in developed societies - What're you doing? - Campaigning I said no campaigning after 5 Get going.. Enough.. to your studies She's right. Enough for today Are you neglecting the garden? Have you all left your chores to sit here? Go see to your work Is this a place to put the broom, in the living room? - Where are the girls? - In their room I want the house spic-and-span Alright We're having an important guest for dinner Alright That's enough now.. enough What happened? Mahmoud hit me and yelled at me He wouldn't let me invite Nabil Where can I meet him? How dare he give himself such liberties! Why can a boy bring his girlfriend home while a girl can't ask her boyfriend? Calm down, this is not the time I'll fix everything We have a guest coming to dinner I want you to be cheerful and not mention this matter And you, comb your hair and wear a nice dress For my sake Who's coming? Probably some old fogy from the ministry If he's an old bore I'll say hello and leave Do you notice something about Mum? - Notice what? - I've noticed I don't understand why Mum wants us to meet this guest - What of it? - Why's he coming? Mum, can you do my tie? Cigarettes can ruin your health But they shouldn't ruin your morals If you insist on smoking don't steal cigarettes Lose either your health or your morals.. But not both Welcome, welcome Mr Ahmed - Hello - We've been waiting for you Come in, come in Mustafa, Law School - Hello - Wonderful - Madiha, Fine Arts - Hello - Maha, high-school - Hello - Mahmoud, 10th grade - Hello - Medhat, 9th grade - Hello - Mamdouh, 6th grade - Hello All your names start with M I told you, the Empire of M Come in After the elections it won't be an empire Lots of things will change This election thing is original I've been to many countries - but never heard of home elections The family in its natural state - is a socialist cell within society The prevailing social system must include the family Enough, Mustafa Mustafa loves politics and political discussions Are you interested in politics too, Mahmoud? No Mahmoud's hobby is music Great, but you're still in school I tell him when he graduates from college he can become a musician, a writer, whatever he wants - Correct - Of course he'll agree It's not correct, how can it be? Why shouldn't he become a musician now and waste his chance? Is a college degree a must? Charlie Chaplin didn't go to college, neither did Shakespeare But they made use of their talents and were able to benefit society Let's continue our chat at the table This way, Mr Ahmed See what I see? We look so nice tonight, all made up.. Please, sit here Where did you go on your last trip? To London Actually I'm sick of traveling I've decided to concentrate my business here I'll have an office here - with reps in other counties I want to be a rep I notice you do all your business with capitalist countries In business there's no capitalism or socialism For example - France does more business with Russia - than Russia does with China Likewise - America has trade with Russia Business is business - Enough politics, Mustafa - No, this is important No need for important talk now Could you live amidst such a crowd? You heard the discussions and saw what might happen We'll get used to each other I think we should wait till you get used to each other The reality of the situation will help us do so I mean when we all live together Broach the subject and make them face reality I don't know I'm so confused I'm even more frightened now Mustafa, I want you Sit down, Look, Mustafa.. Since we're all being so honest and since everybody does as they please that we're holding elections and choosing a chairman I want to tell you something I've been hiding from you A certain person has proposed to me I've been refusing him for years - but he keeps proposing - Marriage? Your mother's still young and receives offers of marriage What do you think? Noting so far. I'd like to hear your opinion It's your right You've deprived yourself of many things for us But now you must marry and live your life Telling you not to marry would be selfish And I'm certain neither of us are selfish You agree, then? Yes, Mum. Congratulations It's still early for that I haven't accepted yet We'll talk more about this later I suppose it's Mr Ahmed.. There's news.. A new incident I want to tell you about Mum has a suitor, she's getting married I didn't think the matter would come to marriage The groom is Mr Ahmed, of course. It was obvious It's her right, she must marry Have mercy. She's been alone for 10 years We thought she got used to being alone Where will they live when they're married? With us here, of course She can't leave us and live somewhere else with him Where will he sleep? What a ridiculous question! In Mum's room He's going to sleep with Mum? Oh, no! A lot of things will change when a stranger comes to live here He won't be a stranger when they marry Two days ago another stranger was coming to our house Nabil will visit me just as Souad comes to visit you and Mervat comes to visit Mustafa No one's visited me yet This isn't the time for such talk No we should agree while remaining confident - that nothing will change our will The elections will decide the authority We'll all vote for Mustafa as chairman of the house It's the only way to run our own affairs Will you inform the popular platform about the marriage? No, this is a private matter So much for the M empire. He's not an M - Should we change his name? - We'll call him Mishmish Congratulations Why, nothing's happened yet I agree Wait till I agree first Mustafa says it's your right As long as my right isn't at the expense of yours Congratulations I told them They all agree But their looks say the opposite It would've been better had they refused Don't be like that. It's your imagination Just as you imagined that they're having elections - to do without you. Who can do without their mother? I agreed to the elections as a game But our affair isn't a game; it could harm them Many people with children have remarried and the kids are fine Many remarried, hurt their kids and ruined their futures Think of yourself, Give some of your love to yourself don't give it all to them You can't make them happy unless you are And you haven't been happy for years I don't know I can only be happy if my children are You're nervous right now Calm down, we'll talk tomorrow How about dinner? I have some foreign guests I'll pick you up at 9 No, better to meet somewhere At home; we've got nothing to hide Where to, Mum? Will you go out everyday? No, but I've been invited to dinner - You won't eat with us? - I want to come with you It's getting late; go to bed But I want to come Leave Mum alone, Mamdouh. Have a good time What are you doing up? I couldn't sleep; I tried but I couldn't Come, darling. Come to bed What did you and Mustafa decide? That I must try Do you know what your problem is? You have no hobbies You should take up sports or art.. Mamdouh isn't wrong to love Soccer Mahmoud isn't wrong to love guitar - What do you like? - Writing novels and stories Write, then, after you finish your schoolwork I'll buy what you write Who knows, it might get published or made into a film - Really? - Really Write, and I'll buy I'll start tomorrow.. no, tonight Go on - Where's Mamdouh? - I don't know You don't know? Madiha.. Maha! - Where's Mamdouh? - I don't know Oh, God! Mustafa.. - Is Mamdouh with you? - Where? I can't find him Go look for him instead of standing there Mamdouh! - Did you find him? - No Madiha.. I found him I found him, Madiha Why are you sleeping here? They said you were scared to sleep alone, so you're getting married - We thought you'd died - You terrified us We thought tomorrow's party was ruined - What party? - The election party - election night - Must there be a party? Of course. We've invited all our friends - to share the experience so that every home can hold elections You plan all that without my permission? During elections we don't ask our opponent's opinion I'm an opponent now? An enemy, right? You can hold your own party No, I won't The house belongs to those who work in it What a mess! Who'll clean this? Did you ask Uncle Ahmed to come? Why? He's neither a candidate or a voter We've invited our friends and he's your boyfriend I don't like the word boyfriend It's improper Besides, it's not your business I don't know why Mum won't invite Mr Ahmed Let's invite him and surprise Mum so we can bring our friends But she doesn't want him I bet she wants him to come but she's hesitant - I'll go call him - I'll come with you - Where will we get his number? - From the phone book Mustafa the patron of soccer Mum, didn't you invite any of your friends? I've nothing to do with this party, dear Mum, this is Ismail How do you do? Mum, this is Nabil, my boyfriend Uncle Ahmed is here, too - Hello - Hello I'm here because the kids invited me Who called you? It was either Madiha or Maha They issued a formal invitation on behalf the family Shall I sit with you or with those who invited me? With me, of course Look, Mona, I.. Let's not talk about us today. This is the children's party A moment, folks Brothers and sisters, tonight is unlike any other night This isn't an ordinary party It's an election meeting We invited people who aren't our constituents - and non-voters so that they may share the experiment and practice it The experiment is to introduce the State system into every home Like any other organization there are elections and a management board, and a chairman Management in the home must be done through elections Excuse me - Come here - Like what she's doing? I want no scenes. If you're worried about her, go sit with her or take them with you He's your guest. I want no scenes Alright, Mum - Anything wrong? - No, nothing Where are your friends, Mamdouh? I'm sitting with Mum Come on, Hassanein, join us Let's have beer together; let's drink If all elections were like this - everyone would come to vote like me Here, Abdou Drink with us, Aziza - Me? - yes, go ahead - Did you talk to your dad? - He refused - What will you do? - Wait till he agrees Suppose he never agrees? What do you want me to do? Daddy, Daddy, just like a little boy Excuse me Not that music Change it to something fast I'll buy you another If we marry could we live on my salary alone? It's only 17 pounds We'd have to live in Dad's house or yours I'm ready to live with you on 10 pounds, but you can't You live in Zamalek and so do I I live in a villa, not a flat like you But I'm ready to live in an alley or a hut Consider it's over I wouldn't marry you even if your father agreed Excuse me Madiha, what is it? Mustafa, ask the folks to come and dance Didn't you preach for equality? Yes, we should do that Hassanein, come dance with us This party's for everybody That wouldn't be proper, sir Be modern, there's no such thing as proper or improper, nor high or low What certain people do everyone has the right to do - As you wish - Come on Hear me out! Mr Mustafa Mr Mustafa.. A thousand times Mr Mustafa God bless Mr Mustafa Play! It's a shock, Mum, a shock! Consider what happened an experience - not a shock You're still young Someday you'll meet the man who understands and appreciates you He'll be independent You deserve the best man in the world Don't frown Smile and forget what happened Don't let anyone see you like this Smile.. smile Let's join the guests What have you done to yourself? It's not my fault Mustafa, go sit with Mr Ahmed What for? Go on! Come, Madiha, help me move this oaf Just what I needed.. help him lie down Watch his head - What has he drunk? - Beer - Who brought beer to the house? - Mustafa And I thought he was grown up and sensible What will he do to you if he runs the house? Sorry for leaving you alone, Ahmed - You must be bored - Calm down You seem very nervous What can I do? As you can see.. Even the eldest whom I thought was old enough to know better - behaves mindlessly I lied when I said I'd be with you with a third of mind I have no mind left A moment, please Those who have the right to vote, write your nominee's name Aren't you going to vote, Mum? No, dear Who will count the votes? I will It should be the eldest voter It's either Aziza or Hassanein Aziza's older than me Really, Hassanein? Don't you remember? I remember - Mum - What to do? I love her - Mum - One must know a mother's worth Mistress Mona Loyal Aziza! Mum The Mistress Bless you, Hassanein - Mum - That's me, Mum! - We have a majority - One vote left It must be Mustafa's Mum You too, Mustafa? Congratulations, Mistress God bless you, Mistress What was all the fuss about, then? To tell you we love you Now let's elect a board of directors - All of us are the board - We're all with Mum Congratulations, may you be appointed minister next Minister! The children's problems are enough for me Their problems can be solved Their problems never end They need me more with every passing day What about us? You know how much I need you But I'm only one person, and they're six Is everything between us over, then? What's between us can never be over But presently I can't be both yours and theirs There's only one solution I'll go abroad again The more I need you and feel you near me - I'll go further away But I'll never lose hope I'll always be hoping Leave Leave so you can come back But don't say you're leaving Say you'll give me time to think Mum, we've composed a new salute to our empire We should call it the Democratic Empire of "M" Let's call it the land.. Land of love Where everyone loves one another Mustafa : Khaled Abu El-Naga Medhat : Hisham Selim Mamdouh : Ahmed Naguib Mahmoud : Usama Abul Fotouh Madiha : Hayat Kandil Maha : Layla Hamada The Empire of M Produced by: Murad Ramsis Naguib
