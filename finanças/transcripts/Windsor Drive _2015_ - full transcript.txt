What would you do if you ever lost me? I would come find you. What if it wasn't possible? Everything is possible. Promise me you'll always come find me. I promise. I want to stay with you here forever. I love you. River did you hear me? Hello! You in there, asshole? Hello! Open the fucking door! The devils are here... Hell is empty... The devils are here. Hard to read. The end is blurry. Jordana, we have to go. Guys? Ivy? Wulfric? River, I've gotta get to work. Forget my job? No, I can't forget my job. Not all of us are going to be famous actors one day. Someday, the two of us are going to... live on a little country ranch in Montana... Just the two of us? Just the two of us. I like that. I like you. Alright, I gotta go. Don't forget, we have drinks tonight... with your two favorite people, Pete and Jenn... River did you hear me? Don't forget, we have drinks tonight... with your two favorite people, Pete and Jenn... River, did you hear me? Don't forget, we have drinks tonight... with your two favorite people, Pete and Jenn... Did you hear me? River, did you hear me!? So, how'd you find the place? I saw the sign on the front lawn. I figured as much, smartass. How'd you really find the place? I guess it kinda found me. It tends to draw people in. Can I help you? I'm here to see the room that's available. Really? Promise me... you'll always come find me... I usually have someone to show the house, but... I guess I can let you in. I'm the one that's going to be... making the final decisions anyway. You're not some psycho, right? Like, circling the neighborhood to try to find your next victim? I'm just looking for a room. What are you going to do with me when you become famous? I'm gonna leave you. Don't say that. You can be one of my fans. I'll be your biggest fan. OK. Now we gotta go. Yeah. I'm not going out. I've got to practice my monologue. But it's already good. It has to be perfect. Where do you come up with this preachy stuff? It... It makes you sound psychotic! You know I hate that word. I know you hate that word. It's just... it sounds a little psycho when you talk. You know why I HATE that word! I know, because Jordana... DON'T YOU DARE FUCKIN' MENTION HER NAME! Why do you always freak out every time I mention her name? I'm not trying to upset you, River, I just... How are we supposed to get to know each other better... when... I don't know anything about you. I just... I'm sorry. Look, I didn't mean to upset you. I just want to know more about you. We've really got to go. You know I don't fucking drink! I have no desire to hang out with your low-life friends! They're losers, dead beats, coke-heads... living off their parents' money, getting fucked up every night. Why would you say that? I don't say shit like that about your friends. I don't have time for fucking friends Brooke. I'm busy doing something with my life... not drinking my life away. You're gonna be stuck in this shithole... for the rest of your life! Fuck you! Wulfric. River. As you can see, we like to keep things simple around here. This is my favorite room in the entire house. Creepy. How so? Living in a house with things that are dead. Nothing truly ever dies. Where are you going? I'm moving to LA, Brooke. I'm leaving today. LA? What about Montana? What about Montana? A ranch... Just the two of us. Maybe... kids, and a wedding. Kids? You think that I want fucking kids? One fuckin' kid would ultimately end my life. I would have to give up everything. My goals, my dreams. I'm not ready for that. And clearly neither are you. This. This thing we've got going on... that you like to call a relationship. It's fizzled out, run out of steam. Not worth fighting for anymore. You don't mean that! Yes I do! I want to go with you! Don't you fucking get it? But I love you! I never fucking loved you. It's over, Brooke. What? Why? So. How'd you find the place? Promise me you'll always come find me. I promise. Who's artwork is this? Well, mine, of course. No, I'm lying. Look, if you're not interested, just tell me know... and stop wasting my time. No no no, I'm interested. All right then. You have a job, right? Unemployed and a smartass. You really are a catch. Ivy's going to love you. Ivy? - You go see if she's in there. - I'll catch up to you. Get out of my house before I phone the authorities! Shhhhh. Darling it's me. I am just showing a new friend here the room. Sorry, I thought you were a thief or something. I'm River. Ivy. Ivy Valeska. What a beautiful name. Sorry, I thought you were a thief or something. It's catchy isn't it? I thought of it myself. Stage names... Stage names? Everyone has a stage name in LA, River. It tells the industry that you're serious. With giant capital letters. We're actors River. I thought you were a painter? I'm an artist, in all aspects. I'm an actor too. - We're obsessed with 20s cinema. - Aren't we baby? We kind of have to be. Film History River. You have to learn from the greats... if you're ever going to be one. Would I have seen you in anything? I've been acting since I was a child, mostly foreign films. Films that most likely you haven't seen... you being American. Wulfric and I met on set. Isn't it funny how that always happens? Set romances. Ours turned out not to be just a set romance. Right. Let me show you the room. It was nice meeting you River. You too. He's perfect. What's with the birds at night here? Its kind of eerie. Morning glories. You'll get used to them. What happened to the guy who used to live here? He disappeared. Took off one day without so much as a word. And what if he comes back? He won't. Trust me. What's that? That is the Leaf building. Leaf building? Influential casting companies in business. Leaf Casting... Liz Leaf is casting... the new Windsor Drive film. I didn't realize they were making another one. The first one was so... devastating. Several times. It's one of my favorites. Not too many people have. I'm surprised that you... That's because you don't know me. So do you want the room or not? How much did you say the rent was? Eleven hundred. When can I move in? Jordana!? Jordana!? Full house. Such rough hands for someone so young. That's because they've been through a lot. We'll let the past be the past. To new experiences. Now accepting submissions from agency represented actors only. No unsolicited submissions. What the hell did I tell you, asshole? I didn't know you were a morning person. I'm here to see Liz Leaf. I wasn't notified of any casting today. Let me see your ID. This is Randy. I have a River Miller here to see Liz. I don't have a River Miller on the list. Copy. Sorry buddy. You're not in the system. You're an actor? Agent. I'm here to drop off materials for Liz. Why don't you do me a favor, huh, Randy? Why don't you give this to her for me? No unsolicited packages. Why don't you get out of here. Beat it, before I call the cops. There's a guy dressed in blue from head to toe. Asking for Liz. Just a heads up. Didn't know you were a morning person. I didn't know anyone was up. Well now you do. Thanks. You in? I've never played dice before. Well it's time to learn. Besides, everyone plays dice now. Ivy and I play at work for hours. Oh yeah. Lowest number goes first. I never lose. Where do you guys work? At a bar called The Hideout down the street. I thought you were actors. All actors work on the side, River. Only a select few are good enough to support themselves... solely by acting. What on earth do you keep laughing about? Casting. Liz is actually in a casting session right now. I'll have her give you a call back, Jerry. Can I help you? Uh, they're in session, is there something I can help you with? I'd like to give her something. I'll pass it on to her. I'd like to make sure she actually gets it, personally. Well, you're gonna have to wait... they're in session till 5 o'clock.. I can wait. Have a seat. Yeah, he's here. Well now what? It's your turn to roll. Beginner's luck. Now I've got to figure out a way... to get back in front of Liz. I'm sure you'll figure it out. What the fuck? What the hell did I tell you, asshole? Yeah I'll take two of whatever she's having. You got it. Can I get you something buddy? Here ya go. May I sit? You want to sit with me? What are you guys doing? Join us. What are you guys doing? May I sit? You want to sit with me? Yeah. Can I? Yeah. I guess. I brought you a drink. Oh, you didn't have to do that, I can get my own drink. I wanted to. I'm River. June. I've never noticed you here before. That's because I'm not noticeable. That's not true, I noticed you the minute I walked in the door. Why are you talking to me? Because I want to. What do you want? Nothing. I just want to talk to you. I highly doubt that. Where are you going? Home. So you can read your self-help book at home alone? I don't need to be judged by you. I'm not judging you, it's just... I'm pretty sure the number one rule of the book is... not to go home, and read it alone. Well, aren't you observant. It was nice meeting you River. Stay and talk to me. Join us. It's called astronomy, River. Study of celestial objects. Space and the universe. I know what astronomy is, Wulfric. I'm just making sure. I used to love stargazing. What do you think happens to stars when they die? They just fade away. Nothing just fades away. If anything, stars shine brighter after death. What are you talking about. Fame is a drug you will chase until you die. And only in death will you become famous. Do you believe in life after death, River? Maybe. You should. Why? Let us show you. So june, what's your story? Everyone's got one. Mine isn't that interesting. Let me be the judge of that. I moved to LA to become a casting director. Right now, I'm junior casting... under the one and the only Liz Leaf. Never heard of her. Well now you know my story, I wanna know yours. I'm an actor. Of course you are. That would be my cue to leave. What? Why? It figures you would be "an actor". It's just my luck. And what's wrong with that? Everyone in this town is an actor. I work with actors all day. The last thing I want to do... is be hanging out with one outside of work. For all I know, you just want to hang out with me... so you can get a role in some movie. Let's make a deal, June. For as long as we know each other... I'll never bug you about your work. If you never bug me about mine. For as long as we know each other? That is a little bit presumptuous don't you think? I'm just trying to put your little heart at ease. It's late. I really should get going. No, I can drive myself, thank you. Well, can I at least get your number or something? I don't give out my number to actors. Well... here's mine. In case you change your mind. It was really nice meeting you. What is it? It's Peyote. Is it safe. Of course. Go on. Trust me. Close your eyes. Now I want you to picture someone who was close to you. Perhaps someone you'd like to see again. You're an asshole, you fucking piece of shit! You're an asshole, you fucking piece of shit! I'll fucking kill you! You do that again I'll kill you, motherfucker! Fucking psychopath! You sick prick! I'm gonna take your face... and burn you alive! MATT; Open the fucking door! Can I help you with something? Someone yelling just woke me up. Do you have any concept of how hard it is... to get to sleep for me? I'm sorry. I had no idea someone was next door... listening to me. Right, everybody's sorry for something in their life. Alright? Don't be sorry. Who you yelling at? I can't do this. What do you mean we can't do this? If he ever found out, he would kill us. Never again. But that... It's over. Forget about us. Forget about us? But, I love you! But I love you! I love you. I love you! I love you?!? I FUCKING LOVE YOU?!?! Do you even know what those words mean?!? Of course I know what those words mean. - We're fucking. - That's not love. You don't mean that. You don't mean that! Yes I do! You can't find love in a month. That's lust you feel. I found love once. And I know I'll probably never find it again. So stop wasting your time on me. Everyone in this town is an actor. Last thing I want to do is be hanging out with one... Outside of work. And, for all I know, you just want to hang out with me... so you can get a role in some movie. Well, can I at least get your number? I don't give my number out to actors. I found love once. And I know I'll probably never find it again. So stop wasting your time on me, That was amazing. Really, a really nice performance. If you read like that... she would be stupid not to offer you the role. What are you doing in here? Just reading lines for River's audition. We're late for work. What the fuck are you doing in here? It's a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe... that lures him to his evil ways. Excuse me? Are Wulfric and Ivy working tonight? What? Wulfric and Ivy? The hell is that? They work here? No they don't. Where do you guys work? At a bar called the Hideout. Surprise. Wait a minute. There you are. Didn't know if you were coming back... after what happened the other night. That was a real fucked up thing of Wulfric to do. Stay away from her. River... Don't be mad at me for something he did. I was just trying to enlighten you... Open you up to new experiences. So I went back-So I went back- So I went back tot he Hideout and had a drink. Oh, you did? Yeah. I asked for you and Wulfric... but no one knew who you were. You asked who? The bar-back. James... Troublemaker. Probably thought it was comedic. He didn't seem like the comedic type. What's that? Sounded like a car. Promise me you'll always come find me. You sick, delusional, hypocritical slut! All this time you pretend like you want to... When you knew me all along you stalker bitch! Why don't you come back here... and say it to my face, you little whore! Fuck you, River! Don't you dare fucking come back! I never fucking loved you. Jordana, we have to go. River! Look at me, River! My meds! Your meds? In the cabinets! Here. June. Well isn't this a nice surprise. If I would've known I would've worn something nicer. I like what you're wearing. You're reading the Confederacy of Dunces? Yeah, I really like it so far. That is one of my all-time favorite novels. What are you doing here? Laundry. Right. Yeah, it's a laundromat. I live down the street. So do I! Careful, you tell me where you live... I could be some creepy stalker... I'm... I'm not... You never called me, June. I was a little hurt. I'm sorry. I meant to, I still am... It's just I... Liz has had me so slammed at work and... I... she's actually still worried about where... all her stuff is right now. So I have to go. You're working on a Saturday? Yeah, stuff we're working on is all due next week... so we're crammed. Top secret mission, huh? It was nice running into you again. June... Do you want to come over for dinner tonight? I told you how I feel about actors. So let me change your mind. I'll cook for you. Okay. Yeah. Perfect. My place. Text me and I'll send you the address. Alright I will. Where you at, June... Oh god... Hey you. Hey. You look great. Thank you, so do you. Why don't you let your hair down. Wow. River, I'm not used to all this special treatment. Well get used to it. I'll be right back. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message- Fuck, June. Answer the goddamn phone, June! Where did you learn to cook like this? As with anything, practice makes perfect. Thanks for giving me a chance, June. I know I said we wouldn't talk about work, but- Honestly, I feel that you would be perfect for... the role that Liz is casting right now. I don't know, June... I wouldn't wanna mess up what we've got going on here. No, don't be silly. Tomorrow's the last day we're casting. So you should come in. Please? Okay. Stay away from her. Promise me you'll always come find me. River, do you hear me? So, did you try on the skirt of little Miss Casting Director? Well? I had such a great time tonight. I don't know how to thank you. You just did. I'll see you tomorrow. I did what I had to do to get the audition. You don't sound too excited. Hey. River, look at me. What is it? What's wrong? Whose is it? Who do you fucking think? Everything I've worked for just went down the drain. If she keeps it, I'm gonna have to move back to Tahoe. Don't say that. Hey. Hey! No. You have to take care of it. What the fuck is he doing over there? He's starting to piss me off. Probably contemplating suicide. Because I'm here. Spending time with you. I'll take care of it. I'll go appease him. Liz, this is River Miller. Hey. Rough night, neighbor? Wait a minute... Aren't you... Yes you are! You're Young John Winchester... from Supernatural! You live next door!? Surprise! Do you mind actually coming in and helping me with my lines? That-I mean, I could use your professional opinion. Do you have any concept-I'm sure you don't... Of how hard it is for me to get to sleep at night? Things that go on in my mind... Thing that would play over and over... Stuff that I have to deal with!? I'm so sorry, I didn't-I had no idea... Someone was next door listening. I've got to meditate for two hours in dead silence... before I go to sleep. 'Cause if not... I'm gonna wake up in a puddle of sweat... in a fucking anxiety attack! So could you mind just keeping it down? Sure thing. I feel ya. We can't do this anymore. We can't do this anymore. We can't do this anymore. Do you want to go before me, bro? I just... I don't know I think it would be a good move for me. Strategically. It's nothing against you. If you aren't ready, that's fine. Are you ready? I mean you look... Ready? You know I like to help people out. You know spur of the moment stuff. Sometimes you get in there you're not ready. You're ready. Whatever it is, it comes off more natural. Either way, what's the big deal? It's Liz. You know Liz, right? She's awesome. Awesome. Sweetheart. Really. She loves me. So when are call backs, baby? I want to clear my schedule. Uh, you know. It could be days or weeks. It was good? Good. Yeah, great. Okay, great. Bye! Bye. Matt? Hey, Jamie! Oh my god, River. Are you okay? What happened to you after I left? I had a rough night. I feel like you should have stitches or something. I'm okay. It's fine. You sure? JUNE! Casting sessions over, buddy. I nailed it. Come on, smile. It looks better on you. I can try and get you a later call time. Really, it's not a big deal. I'm in character. Okay Liz, this is River Miller. Let's see. Short. Short. Some feature no one's ever heard of. Another short. Wow. Such an impressive resume. Who represents you again? It's not like that matters. I don't have time for this. Let's get started. Scene 1. Do you want me to slate? What do you think? Hurry. I'm River Miller, and I'm here to read for the role of Cain. We can't do this? What do you mean we can't do this? If he ever found out, he would kill us. But that would mean... It's over! Forget about us! That's enough. What? We didn't even... We didn't even finish the scene. Yes. Yes, we have. Why couldn't you just let him finish? That's all I needed to see. He was amazing. You didn't give him a chance. I've been in this business for years. I know what I'm talking about. Hey. Did you miss me? Oh yes, you did. You said I couldn't find you. You thought you could get rid of me that easily, didn't you? Awww. You thought we were done. We will never... Be done. I'm going to name her Jordana. Oh you poor thing. You didn't know? Shhhh... Now, if I untie those, are you going to be a good boy? Okay. Shhhh... You think I want fucking kids? One fucking kid would ultimately end my life. STOP! NO! The devils are here... Hell is empty... The devils are here. Stay with me. Why?! Why?! Why JORDANA?! Jordana, please! Please Jordana! Promise me, you'll always come find me. I love you. River, did you hear me? I want to stay with you here forever. I'm going to name her Jordana? River? I'm glad you took care of it. It's for the best, trust me. You'll find her in the darkness. - There's no such thing as death. - There's no such thing as death. There's no such thing as death. There's no such thing as death. There's no such thing as death. There's no such thing as death. There's no such thing as death. There's no such thing as death. There's no such thing as death. There's no such thing as death. There's no such thing as death. There's no such thing as death. There's no su... River? Oh my god... So nice to finally meet you, Brooke. We've heard so much about you. All good things I hope. No, actually. Terrible things. Shut the fuck up! You already killed her. Don't you remember? I love you! I love you! My name is River Miller. I am 27 years old. I have no problem getting my hands a little dirty... To ensure that things are done right. Some might find it a little off. River? Strange perhaps... but there is a method to the madness... There are only 2 relevant human emotions... Love... and Fear... What would you do if you ever lost me? All others are meaningless.
