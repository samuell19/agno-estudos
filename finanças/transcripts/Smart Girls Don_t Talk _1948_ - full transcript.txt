[instrumental music] [music continues] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] - Check your coats, gentlemen? - We won't be long. Good evening, gentlemen. Do you have a reservation? - Do you need a reservation? - I'm afraid you do. - You want to make a book-- - Now, just a moment. Take it easy, you fella.. (male #1) 'Place your bet, boy. Place your bets, gentlemen.' 'Place your bets.' 'Place your bets.' Bets down. No more bets. Bets down. - Some chips, sir? - I'll take cash. - What goes on here? - Scavenger hunt, friend. Alright? Everyone, reach. Let's have all your valuables. [indistinct chatter] [alarm buzzing] [indistinct chatter] - What is it, a stick job? - Come on, minuteman. Hold it, I don't want any fireworks. This is a little early for Christmas. One shot and this place will be swarming with cops and I want to stay open for business. Take a look and see if you know any of them. [instrumental music] I'll take that. That thin one is Johnny Warjak. Never heard of him. He's a small time penny-ante chiseler operatin' around Los Angeles. It looks like he's trying to move up in company. Oh, what next? Do we just stand here? That's it exactly. We can settle his What's-His-Name later. I've often heard of juvenile delinquence. This is the first time I've ever seen one in action. Just big for my age. Looks like they're clearin' out. [instrumental music] Let's go, come on. Before we have a riot on our hands I want you to make an announcement. Tell that crowd down there that we'll stand good for any property or cash they've lost in the hold-up. Are you kiddin'? Look, keep the gamblers happy, Sparky. Invest a few bucks in goodwill and they'll return it with interest and love you like a brother. My brother was a rat. You're gonna let this punk Warjak get away with it? Don't sell me short, Cliff. I just want this place to remain clean. You can't buy a reputation at any price but that doesn't mean we're letting anybody get away with anything. See if you can get a line on this Warjak. Hold it. I can find out where Warjak hangs his head in three minutes. Alright. Pay him a little visit. But don't use any of our cars. They can be traced. Stop second guessin' me. In my own way, I'm a genius. Come on, Jack. [music continues] [instrumental music] (Fain) This is okay. Show in Mr. Nelson Clark. I want to see him. Well, this one seems alright. This is like bank night. Bankrupt would be more like it. You wanted to see me, Fain? See if you can find Ms. Linda Vickers. (male #2) 'Linda Vickers, right.' You put in a claim for 10,000 cash? That's correct. Mr. Clark, somewhere along the line I think you've picked up the nasty habit of lying. Well, see here, Fain. You made the offer. I know what I offered. If you had 10,000 in cash why were you playing on paper? Well, because.. Because you didn't have ten dollars let alone $10,000. I had an idea you'd squirm out of it somehow. You were wrong. How much does Mr. Clark owe the house? Up to last night, he owed us $23,000. - Is that right, Mr. Clark? - Well, yes. - How long have we carried it? - 'Couple of months.' You only owe us $13,000 now, Mr. Clark. That's mighty decent of you, Fain. Thanks. But in the future this club won't handle your play. Don't I get a chance to get even? Not here. And I want your claim settled one week from today. - But I need time-- - Goodnight, Mr. Clark. [music continues] I presume I'm next. Hello, Ms. Vickers. Have a seat. Thank you. - Have we met before? - I-I don't believe so. You seem to know me on sight. Don't be modest, you're famous. - You flatter me. - Not at all. Fame can sometimes be disastrous. People get to know too much about you. Your claim says, two diamond clips one earring, $18,000. I have a hunch you left out a word. - A word? - Mm-hmm. Paste. Paste diamonds, more like $200. At least you didn't call me an outright liar like your last friend. - He's no friend of mine. - My mistake. Tell me, Mr. Fain, how did you arrive at such an amazing deduction? You mean about the diamonds? Like I said, fame can sometimes be disastrous. I know all about you. You're a society girl. Maybe your name only, but nevertheless.. You had an estate on Long Island until your father got mixed up in the market. Now all you've got left is a name that looks good in "Who's who," but you can't trade that in for cash or diamonds. You're positively profound. Another thing, about eight months ago you were hauled into court on a bad check count. You also read the papers. I like to keep track of my customers. This is all very interesting, but unnecessary. You really don't have to pay for my clips. They're insured. Or don't you want the insurance companies in on the act? Now you're being clever. I'm a gambler, Ms. Vickers and I like to press my hunches. Show me your insurance policy and I'll double your loss. Mr. Fain, you've just made a deal. I'll mail it to you tomorrow. Unh-unh. You got too many friends. One of them might sell insurance. What about the date? I said the policy is in effect right now. Men have fought wars over beautiful women. What is to keep one from backdating an insurance policy? You're a trustful soul, aren't you? Unfortunately, I don't make a habit of carrying my papers with me. - Where are they? - At my home. - Fine. Let's go. - 'What about these?' They're alright. Pay 'em off. - Where are we going? - To your place. Don't be ridiculous. I'm calling your bluff, Ms. Vickers. Do you want to throw in your hand? Not on your life. That's a good bet. Even if he loses, he can't lose. [instrumental music] Evening, Ms. Vickers. That was a tough break you got, boss. - I'm sure sorry. - You and me both. Would you bring my car around, Tommy? Oh, it-it-it might take a little while, Ms. Vickers. What's the matter? Oh, nothing, nothing at all. We just got a little jammed up here and Cliff had to take Ms. Vickers' car to another lot. We could use my car. I have to come back anyway. Oh, it's right here. [engine rumbling] [instrumental music] You're not much in conversation. I didn't know we were being social. Perhaps, you'd like a drink? No, thanks. Mind if I have one? I'm no puritan. [music continues] I told you I didn't want one. Might as well drink it, it'll prevent your evening from turning into a complete bust. Look, Ms. Vickers, if you just show me the policy I won't take up anymore of your time. Don't play-act. You weren't worried for a minute. You mean there isn't any policy? - Aren't you surprised? - I'm astounded. Well, why did you go to all this trouble? Why did you? Must you answer a question with a question? Alright. I wanted to see you work your way out of this. Well, I was certainly going to remember that the policy was locked in my safety deposit box. - That would've been graceful. - Mm-hmm. - Why didn't you? - Too much trouble. Anyway you'd probably have come up with a key to the bank. On second thought, I think I'll have that drink. You're a strange sort of person. - Really? - You're all out of character. The parts don't fit. Oh, you mean I should talk out of the corner of my mouth and wear a diamond stick pin? Something like that. I'm not sure. You don't seem to have any normal emotions. Don't underestimate me. I mean, well, if I were you I'd be furious, boiling over. - About what? - About the hold-up. - About me. - About you? Well, after all, I led you on a wild goose chase. Or doesn't that make any difference? Hunting's my hobby. I think, perhaps, you'd better get my car. Oh, what's the hurry? I'll have it delivered to you later tonight. What makes you think I won't need it now? I don't think you're going any place. You're quite sure of yourself, Mr. Fain. I have to be. Gambling is my profession. To your profession. [instrumental music] [doorbell buzzing] Alright, alright. I'm coming. I'll just be there in a minute. [music continues] [exhales] Wake you up in the middle of the night. - Yes! - Hi, Ms. Vickers. - Here's your paper. - Thanks. Just put it the way you usually do. By the way, Ms. Vickers you still owe me 30 cents for last week. Look, can you come back a little later? How much you on the hook for, son? - Thirty cents. - Here. Thanks! I'm Lieutenant McReady. Homicide. Homicide? What can I do for you? Well, for a start, you might ask me in. Oh, I might as well. Never going to get any sleep this morning. Very nice. [music continues] Now what is it you want to see me about? - This. - My newspaper? No, ma'am. A murder. A murder? [dramatic music] Do you mind if I smoke? No, go right ahead. Thanks. That's the only way to do business. Or I could've dragged you down to headquarters. The place depresses me and so-- - Uninspiring? - Hmm. That's the word. Yes, sir. This is for me. Cheerful surroundings, comfortable chairs-- The company is absolutely charming. - I was just coming to that. - Pick it up later. Right now, I'm more interested in whom I killed where I killed him, and why? I can answer two of those questions. Number one, Johnny Warjak. Doesn't ring a bell. Number two, just outside of a garage at 436 Claremont Avenue. Doesn't help much either. - 'The reason you killed him--' - Aren't you rushing things? If you did... well, that's your problem. You're still betting on fast zero, lieutenant. - Nothing adds up, eh? - Doesn't even subtract. Well, that's the way these things go sometimes. Like a jigsaw puzzle. A lot of little isolated pieces, you put 'em together you got a picture. Just where do I fit into this? Oh, you're the easy kind. Let's see now, you drive a maroon convertible license number 819-890. So long as I keep up the payments. Were you driving it last night? - Yes, why? - Alone? You force me to confess, lieutenant. I do everything the advertisement say and I'm still a wild flower. I doubt it, Ms. Vickers. Just what is my car to do with anything? Whoever killed Warjak did a sloppy job. A woman's touch, obviously. He managed to scroll a license number on the sidewalk before he died. - Mine? - Mm-hmm. Hate to be wet blanket, lieutenant but I didn't kill anyone last night or ever. Mm, just routine. Where were you from, say, 11:15 to 12:30 last night? - Right here. - Alone? Is there nothing secret to a policeman? Can you prove you were here? Yes, the night clerks saw me come in. That must complicate matters. Mm, it'll work out. Did you lend your car to anyone? No. Does anyone have a duplicate set of keys? - No. - Could anyone have stolen it? - It's in my garage right now. - Or barred? Well, if anyone did, my permission wasn't asked. - No other ideas? - No. I guess that's about all for now, Ms. Vickers. I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you. I'll check at the desk on my way out. Oh, by the way, just in case their memories have slipped did anyone else see you come in last night? Yes, but check with the desk clerk first. I'm sick of having my personal life under a microscope. Thanks, Ms. Vickers, it's been a nice visit. I'll see you again, you know. Next time, let's make it less formal. Let's. [instrumental music] Mr. Fain, please. Ms. Vickers calling. Good morning, Marty. How do you feel? Any butterflies this morning? (Linda on phone) 'No, I've got butterflies around' 'but that's not why I'm calling.' A man just came to see me about an automobile. An automobile? What do you mean? - Who was it? - Lieutenant McReady, homicide. Homicide? 'I thought you'd be interested.' Why don't you come over and tell me about it? No, darling, why don't you come over here. I've got a splitting headache. I'll be right over. Alright. Goodbye. What's the matter? I feel like making a corny remark about brains. - Don't let me stop you. - Where is Cliff? I haven't seen him all day. When he comes in, tell him I got a little surprise for him. The cops and Ms. Vickers are getting chummy these days. How come? It seems they got some kind of a slide on her car. - How much does she know? - Hm, I'm not sure. - But she's nobody's fool. - She got an angle? Maybe, maybe not. If she hasn't, I have. I hope it works. If it doesn't.. [door closes] [dramatic music] [doorbell buzzing] Oh, Marty, they're lovely. Or should I be apprehensive? - What do you mean? - Flowers are symbolic. Did you bring them to praise me or bury me? Lovely flowers for a lovely lady. I'm relieved. Tell me, how are the butterflies? Awful, they have delusions of grandeur. They're making like dive bombers. I think they're allergic to Lieutenant McReady. Lieutenant McReady has that effect on people. You just have to learn to ignore it. But will he ignore me? That would be a large order for any man. You should write valentine cards. Oh, there's not enough money in it. Look, it's a beautiful day outside and we're wasting it with small talk. Tell me, how do you look with the wind and the rain in your hair? Usually wet and disheveled. I think you're lying through teeth. Seriously, how would lot of scenery and a lot of fresh air appeal to you? - Seriously, I'd love it. - Lunch at a little roadhouse. - Somewhere upstate. - With a fireplace. Hovering the whole place down for it. Just the fireplace, thanks. - Is it a date? - If it weren't, I'd be a fool. Let me get my coat. Leon, that was the best Chateaubriand I've had since Andre left the business. Oh, what a chef that Andre, the best. You said it. This Beaujolais. This alone is worth the trip up. Thank you very much, Mr. Fain. You're quite an epicure. [chuckles] Not only that, I love good food. I still insist you're out of character. How so? You don't act like a big shot gambler. Your taste, your manner. You remind me of a respectable citizen. Hm, yeah. Respectable. I could've been called respectable once. I come from the right side of the tracks. Even have a college degree. Well, then, how did you get into the gambling racket? Mathematics. I can make a greater return in my investment running the Club Bermuda than I could being a stock broker or a real estate operator. I can see you selling real estate. I did that, too. You have a convenient memory, Mr. Fain. I only remember things I want to remember. Not me. Mine is like an accounting machine. Takes down everything, good or bad. Right here. - That can be a liability. - On the contrary. In my case, it's proven quite profitable. Some people have a healthy respect for good memory. Things my sister's boyfriends did. You'd be surprised to how many quarters found their way to my piggy bank. A blackmailer? That's an ugly word to attach to a your 12-year-old girl. - Ha-ha-ha! - Something funny? Uh, just wondering what happened to the poor guys when they ran short of quarters. I was an awful brat. Want some music? Two bets, brat. What for? Music? For what you're thinking. Don't be extravagant. I think the price is right. You're in reverse. Works the other way. I get paid for not talking. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Marty. Thanks for a lovely day. Did you really enjoy? You chased away the butterflies and made me forget all about Lieutenant McReady. Hm. Are you sure? I don't even know the man exists anymore. By the way, did I ever settle up that claim on your diamonds? Don't you remember? Eighteen thousand, wasn't it? Eighteen thousand and, uh.. ...twenty-five cents. [music continues] Yes, sir. Is Ms. Linda Vickers in? I don't think so. Oh, here she comes now. - Linda! - Doc! Oh, don't worry, mister. No competition. - I'm her brother. - Oh, I'm sorry. Marty, this is Doc. Doc, this is Marty Fain. - Glad to know you. - How are you? Oh, Doc, you look wonderful. It's been ages. Come on upstairs, and we'll have a nice long talk. Marty, would you get my keys, please? Well, tell me, what're you doing here? Why didn't you write? Well, I finished interning in the clinic two weeks ago and Dr. Cliffner thought I was not only industrious but extremely brilliant. My modest baby brother. So, he got me a job as a surgical staff at New York General starting next week. Oh, Doc, that's wonderful. I'm so proud of you. Guess all this must be boring to Mr. Fain Stiff. Oh, not at all. I think it's great. Look, you two have a lot of the past to catch up with so I'll be running along. But I'm throwing a little party tomorrow night Whether you like it or not, you're guest of honor. - Oh, swell. - Nice meeting you, Doc. - See you tomorrow night. - Alright. - Goodnight, Linda. - Goodnight, Marty. Oh, Doc, remember that time when we spent summer 'with you at med school..' [instrumental music] [applauding] ♪ The stars will remember ♪ ♪ The night we said goodbye ♪ ♪ The stars will remember ♪ ♪ So will I ♪ ♪ A rose as a token ♪ ♪ A kiss that brought a sigh ♪ ♪ The stars will remember ♪ ♪ So will I.. ♪ (Bert) 'Oh, good evening, Ms. Vickers' Mr. Fain is expecting you.

Good evening, Ms. Vickers. Well, if it isn't Lieutenant McReady. Have you met Mr. Fain? Uh, we're old friends. Of course, I use the word loosely. Makin' any progress with your jigsaw puzzle, lieutenant? So-so, it's slow work. But I just got an idea how to fit a couple of pieces together. By the way, I hear Johnny Warjak paid you a visit the other night. Warjak? Warjak, it sounds like a full back. What'd he play with? That's what I'd like to know. Word was they play rough and for keeps. That's rough game, lieutenant. You would excuse us for running, will ya? Don't wanna miss the floor show. Keep working on that puzzle, lieutenant. ♪ It seems I hear you ♪ ♪ Call my name ♪ ♪ The world may forget you ♪ ♪ As time goes passing by ♪ ♪ The stars will remember ♪ ♪ So will I ♪ ♪ The stars will remember ♪ ♪ So will I ♪♪ [audience applauding] - Well, how do you like her? - Alright. [chuckles] That's what I call real enthusiasm. I know what Doc's trouble is. He needs companionship. What about that little singer Toni? Well, no sooner said than done. Forget it, Marty, I'm having a great time. I'll be right back. Look, I'm a big boy now. If I want a woman, I'll call my own shots. It was just an excuse to get rid of Marty. There's something on your mind, Doc? What is it? Nothing. I'm fine. Remember me? I'm the little girl with the big ears. What's troubling you? Alright, I'll tell you what's wrong. It's this whole set up, it's Fain. It's, it's gossip column stuff. I had a belly-full of it today, every paper in town. Marty Fain linked with murder, police aren't exactly pointing accusing fingers but-- - Oh, that's a lot of nonsense. - Sure, it's all nonsense. Fain is as pure as the driven snow. They print anything to sell papers. Why don't you trade your scalpel in for a pulpit? Why don't you pull your head out of the clouds? Look, Linda, you don't belong. Fain isn't your type. You've certainly done a switch in 24 hours. Last night he was a great guy. Last night I wasn't hep, but I've been knocking the sticks for a long time. I've done a lot of reading, a lot of talking in 24 hours and believe me, it wasn't pretty. Oh, what is it, Linda? What's in it for you? You're not in love with Fain, are you? Well, are you? [sighs] I don't know. Maybe I am. Oh, come off it. You, you're just heading for a load of trouble. Once you get mixed up with the crowd like this you're in for life, there's no backin' out. You sound like the third paragraph of a ten cent mystery thriller. Alright, if you don't care about yourself then think of me. - You? - That's right. It took nearly nine years of hard work for me to get this hospital appointment and now-- Oh, I see. You're afraid, I might ruin your career by tainting the good old Vickers name with a scandal. Is that it? It'll do till something better comes along. Nothing will. Excuse me, I need some fresh air. This place is getting awfully stuffy. Hey, you gonna leave your brother alone with a strange woman? The best way to teach a man how to swim is to throw him in the river. I know a man who drowned that way. Uh, wait a minute, I'll join you. Uh, Toni, this is Doc Vickers. Doc, Toni. Have fun, kids. That crack about needing some fresh air made for my benefit? No, no, I will, uh.. I'll take credit for that. Oh, bring me a double scotch. - What'll you have? - Nothing. Thanks. Make it two doubles. I'm a split personality. The second one is for the other me. What about that steady hand, Doc? [scoffs] There are rare occasions when getting drunk is the lesser of two evils. What's the other? I don't think you'd understand. Are you kiddin'? These races are murderin' me. Last week I lost 500, the week before that I lost 700 and today I had a three horse parlay cost me a snappy 1000. Well, why do you keep bettin'? Gotta make a livin', don't I? - Hiya, Marty. - Sparky. Is it little cold to be out walking? It's good for me. Trouble with people like us is we spend too much time inside we get cobwebs on the brain. Are you sure you're feeling alright? I'm just beginning to. I'll tell you a secret. I feel just like a little girl who stole a nickel from her mother's purse to buy a chocolate cone. Is that good? And when she got it, she wasn't happy. She wanted a-a lollipop instead. Or maybe or something else. Anyway, the cone tasted like glue. It sounds like a fancy, branded double-talk. You should be used to that by now. When it comes to snappy chatter and quick comebacks I'm right in there every time. I think you talk too much. Funny, you look like the same girl. I said the same thing two hours ago. But something new has been added. I've discovered I have a conscience. What's the matter? Did it bounce? I didn't give it the chance. Look, maybe you're not in the habit of accepting presents. Fact is, the first time I saw you I became interested, I liked you. You just happened to be expensive. I liked you because our minds work the same because our standards were the same. But they're not. We're really 2000 miles apart. We met at a depot when our trains pulled in. Now we're going in opposite directions. You aren't making sense. I'm making sense for the first time. It's all clear in my mind. Don't let that mental accounting machine of yours give you any ideas. Don't worry. I'll be good. Can I get you a taxi? No. I feel like walking. And it's a matter of opinion the dorsal incision or the, the ventral incision. 'Course it depends on individual case. [sighs] It's just a lot of dull bunk. - Let's get out of here. - Unh-unh. What's the matter? Don't forget that I'm the guest of honor. You heard what Fain said. You maybe the guest of honor but I'm not the door prize. Sorry. How do you feel, Doc? Oh, great. Just great. I got a secret for ya. You should only drink when you're sober. [dramatic music] - Where've you been all day? - The library. I didn't hear you come in last night. - I'm sorry-- - About last night, uh.. - Go ahead. - I didn't mean to.. [both chuckling] Guess I acted pretty stuffy last night. I didn't mean it. Will you forgive me? No, Doc, you were right. I've been mixed up. But I'm okay now. I threw off the shackles and I'm free as a bird. - You gave up Fain? - Mm-hm. Not on my account. Do your patients use your prescriptions for their benefit or yours? [scoffs] Honey, your beauty is exceeded only by your tact. Thank you, sir. Oh, by the way, how did you and Toni get on last night? Oh. You would have to bring that up. I, uh, I gave her a pretty rough time which she didn't deserve. I'll try and square things tonight. Oh, you're seeing her again. Well, only because at the present moment I feel like a first class stinker. Why, doctor, what kind of a diagnosis is that? [scoffs] Yes? Yes. Alright, Steve, I'll cover out here up to 5000. Right. - What about Nelson Clark? - He's mad. I don't care about his mental attitude. - Did he pay-off? - He sent you a message. "Your tables are crooked, gambling debts ain't legal and what are you gonna do about it?" I'd have roughed him up a little, only you said-- I said get the money. What's the matter with you, guys do I have to do everything myself? I gave Clark one week and it's up tonight. I'll show you how to handle vultures. Watch your step, chief. [scoffs] Look who's talking. [door closes] He's going alone. Think I should go with him? You go with him, he's still alone. [dramatic music] [music continues] (Miss Frey) 'Yes?' Telephone company, Miss Frey. (Miss Frey) 'What do you want?' Uh, just want to check the register coils uh, some trouble on the line. (Miss Frey) 'Oh, alright.' [music continues] [door buzzing] Hello? Telephone man? [scoffs] Very funny. Halloween's October 31st! [dramatic music] Didn't your flunkies give you my message? I couldn't understand them. Well, I haven't got the money. That's too bad. Now, look here, Fain strong armed methods won't help you get it. I'm in a peculiar business. If one man doesn't pay his debts a lot of others get the same idea and that's bad. Bad for the economic cycle. Well, I wasn't figurin' on telling anyone. After tonight, it won't make any difference. [grunts] - You aren't gonna-- - No. You'll be a good advertisement. No, I.. [screams] Help! Police! [muffled screaming] [dramatic music] [groans] Don't hit me again. I'll get you some money. I've, I've got it right here. [gunshots] [music continues] [gunshot] Want me to pick you up? No, thanks. I'll take a cab. - See you later. - Goodnight, Doc. Good evening. [upbeat music] Hiya, Doc. Back for more punishment? - Is Toni around? - She just finished her number. - I'll tell her you're here. - Thanks. Carlos will take care of you, sir. I had a friend like that once. Never knew when he had enough. One morning, he woke up married. [music continues] [indistinct chatter] (Toni) 'Hello, again.' How do you feel today? Well, I've felt better. Look, uh, about last night, Toni, I'm sorry. I guess I overshot my quarter. Oh, I'd forgotten all about it. I don't make a habit of it. You know, you're kind of a nice guy, Doc. I like you. So as a friend of mine always says "Let's tear up the conversation." Do you wanna dance? Alright. [music continues] [music continues] Mr. Fain. Mr. Fain! Help, somebody! Help! Get me upstairs. [music continues] [sighs] The only difference between that and the stampede is the cover charge. It's odd what people will pay for. [music continues] Well, duty calls. Can you get along without me for a few minutes? I'll try and struggle alone. [music continues] Why didn't you tell me it was a bullet wound? You're a doctor, aren't you? What difference does it make? He's in bad shape. Haven't you got a regular man for this sort of thing? Didn't have time to get him. You don't have to be a sawbones to see that. [sighs] Alright. Where can I wash up? Follow me. [music continues] [music continues] Have you got something I can use for a sling? I'll get somethin'. Give him a shot of brandy. That'll bring him around. [music continues] [indistinct chatter] How do you feel, Marty? Like a man who's been shot. - Did he take care of me? - Yeah. You did a nice job, Doc. I think this will cover everything. Put it away. This one's on the house. Don't be a dope, never do anything for nothin'. Take the money. I'm not that broke. You better get some rest. Don't work that arm or shoulder too much. You'll be alright in a week or so. Be smart, Doc. Take the money. This town's full of medics. Did you have to get him? No, we could've just let you kick off. Doctors hand me a laugh. They'd rather starve than be unethical. You think he'll report it? You saw him with your own eyes. He backed away from those green bags like they were rattle snakes. He sings to the cops, this place will turn into a bowling alley overnight. I'd settle for that. Wait a minute. Maybe he can't be bought. But I think there's a way to reason with him. - Can you get me a cab? - Oh, yes, sir, it.. It might take a minute. [sighs] Never mind. Police department, please. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Hey, wait a minute. Let's have a little talk, eh, Doc? What's there to talk about? You'll find out. Now let's get one thing straight. Alright, be sensible and take the money. It works both ways. You'll be five grand richer and Fain won't get any unnecessary publicity. Look, I've got to report that bullet wound. Fain can take it from there. Somebody's gonna get hurt. If it ain't you, it might be your sister. You got it all figured out, haven't you? Every angle. That's right. Well, I got it figured out too. You're pretty tough, aren't you? Wonder how this is gonna look on your sister. [dramatic music] [clatters] What good's this gonna do? Smart up, sonny, this is just a preview. [clatters] [clatters] [gunshot] You trigger-happy moron. [music continues] [doorbell buzzing] [doorbell buzzing] Just a minute, Doc. What's the matter, lose your key? Next time you get.. Sorry I had to disturb you, miss. Another jigsaw puzzle expert. Don't you fellas ever stop working? I'm afraid you'll have to come down to headquarters with me, miss. At 2:30 in the morning? Not on your life. Don't make it tougher on me, miss. This isn't my idea of fun. What is it this time, another murder? Well, as a matter of fact, it is. You see, we found, um.. What? Well, it's your brother, miss. He's been.. Well, he's been shot. [dramatic music] - What's that? - Lab reports. Ballistics. Personal effects. Pitch in. - Anything interesting? - Not particularly. Looks like both murders may have been gang jobs. - How's that? - Neither one were hold ups. Both Clark and the Vickers get quite a bit of money on them. They both got the same treatment. Roughed up before they were shot. - How's the girl feeling? - She's still wobbly. This business knocked the pins out from under her. It's funny, isn't it? From the minute we're born, we start dying and.. ...yet when a thing like this happens.. What happens? What are you asking me for? Am I a philosopher? Sometimes you worry me, lieutenant. See if Ms. Vickers is up to answering a few questions.. [dramatic music] Shall we get it over with, lieutenant? There's no hurry, if you don't feel up to it. What difference does it make how I feel? Will it change anything? You're the boss. Have you any idea who might have killed-- You think I'd be sitting here if I had? Or are all your questions that stupid? We're on the same side this time, Ms. Vickers. Remember? [sniffles] I'm sorry. Now, about last night.. ...do you know where your brother had been who he was with, where he was going? He went to see a girl, Toni Peters. She's a singer at the Bermuda Club. Fain's place. But you're wrong. Marty wouldn't have touched Doc. Did I say he did? You were thinking it. I'm a cop. I get paid for having suspicions. Just out of curiosity.. ...do you know this man? Wait a minute. Where does he figure in this? You haven't answered my question. I saw him one night in Fain's office. But I don't know him. What was he doing in Fain's office? Something about some money he owed Marty. I'm not sure. Well, this man's name is Clark or rather it was. He was also found murdered. There's no connection except in both cases.. [sobbing] I'm sorry. [sobbing] I'll have someone drive you home. [sobbing] [dramatic music] - Yeah? - Toni Peters. What do you want? Hey, Toni, the law's here. You better hurry up. - Yes? - What's this? The new look? A gift from your boyfriend? She walked into a door. There's a draft in the hall, mind if I step in? We're the shy type. Unless you got a search warrant. Your voice is changing, Ms. Peters. Were you working at the Bermuda Club last night? Yes. I understand you're pretty friendly with a man named Doc Vickers. - I met him once. - Just once, eh? What about last night? Wasn't he with you? Not last night. Was he at the club last night with or without you? - No. - That's right. If he was there, I'd have seen him. Oh, so you work there too, huh? - What else? - Funny. I had you figured for a different kind of work. Why don't you run along, Sherlock? I don't care for your deductions. But she's lying. I drove out to the club myself. I saw him go in. Toni is lying, I tell you. Well, are you just going to stand there? I know she's lying, I knew it the minute I saw that mug in her apartment. Well, then why don't you make her tell the truth? How, the way I made you tell what you knew about Johnny Warjak's death? I didn't have any real evidence. Nothing that could prove anything. Whatever you knew was more than we did. Maybe your testimony wouldn't have added up to anything but on the other hand, it might have been all we needed to stop Fain once and for all. Oh, why do you keep harping on Marty? Well, start from scratch. Toni won't talk because Fain's strong armed boy won't let her. She's already had a taste of what'll happen to her if she opens up. Your brother didn't know a soul in town. There was no apparent common motive. He wasn't held up, he wasn't intoxicated. The most common motive in the world, lieutenant. Doc didn't like my going with Fain he asked me to break it off. What? That would really make it perfect, wouldn't it? If Doc and Marty had fought over my, my honor. [sobbing] Look, Ms. Vickers.. ...I'm out to hook Fain, but he's tough to land. The DA's brought Fain to trial on three different occasions and each time, he's stopped his coup. You know the tactics perjured testimony, intimidated witnesses crooked lawyers, the works. 'What Fain can't buy' 'he gets through threats and rough stuff.' 'His own little fear campaign.' The police are only as good as the cooperation they get from the public. As long as John Q allows himself to be bored off or scared off, our hands are tied. Give me someone who isn't afraid. Someone who's ready to see Fain paid off particularly someone he knows and trusts and I'll hand him the DA on a silver platter with an apple in his mouth. [dramatic music] [trimmer whirring] [knock on door] Yes? - Marty? - 'Yes?' Hello, Linda. Hello, Marty. I know what you're thinking. I haven't much pride, have I? Well, you're right. But it's much simpler that way. No money, no scruples, no pride, no family, nothing. Makes for an orderly mind. I heard about Doc. I'm sorry. Thanks. Have you any idea what happened? No. I wish there was something I could do. There is. Take me back, Marty. I'm lonesome. Because you're lonesome? What's happened? Have our trains pulled into another depot? This time it's for keeps. You're in hot and cold, Linda. It isn't healthy. Don't make me grovel, Marty. You broke it off, not me. And it's me crawling back, not you. What's the matter? Uh, nothing. Make yourself comfortable. Let me finish shaving. [trimmer whirring] Isn't it a little early for you to be running around? What do you mean? After what happened to your brother. Is there any use in mourning? Doc hated hypocritical convention as much as I do. Wearing a black band won't bring him back. I guess you're right. [dramatic music] When it comes to women, they're made of iron. Pig iron. Welcome back to the fold, brat. [music continues] It's good to be home. [gunshots] Yes, sir, I've been a ballistics man for 33 years now. Fired over 26,000 bullets. Never hit anybody though. Just think of it, 26,000 bullets. Gets kind of noisy down here sometimes. 'Yet, I like bullets.' 'They're like faces.' 'No two alike.' 'Unless they're fired from the same gun' 'and then they're identical.' 'Well, I'll have it.' 'Here we are.' And then we'll know in just a minute. (McReady) 'Well, are we in business or not?' - We're not even close. - Are you sure? I'm positive. Well, that's that. If I had a cocked hat I'd lend it to you for a waste basket. This doesn't necessarily prove anything. That's what you think. Fain could've used another gun. Not to kill Clark with, he couldn't. Who's talking about Clark? Wait a minute, what did you say? Fain's gun wasn't used to kill Ms. Vickers' brother. But the slugs from his gun and the once we took from Clark's body are Siamese twins. Holy mackerel! I don't understand this. Wait a second. You will, I hope. These little things have a personality of their own. Hm. I told you. Come here. I never forget a face. (Linda) 'What's wrong?' I'm a little bewildered, that's all. According to this, Fain's the boy who killed Nelson Clark. Or at least his gun did. But if she shot Clark, then he couldn't have killed Doc. Why not? Because they were both killed at the same time fifteen miles apart. The same night, not time. Anything else you aren't confused before I starve to death? Haven't had any lunch yet, you know. Huh? Oh, no, we're finished. Don't know how you work down here anyway. Why? What's wrong with it? No room to pace in. - Hm. - Come on, Ms. Vickers. [instrumental music] What is it? Puzzles, Ms. Vickers. Heaps of puzzles. Now think hard. This is important. When you saw Fain, did you see anything did he do anything to indicate that he might have been shot? No. Wait a minute. Yes, he did. I pressed against his arm and he flinched. But I couldn't swear he'd been shot. 'Why is that so important?' Important? There was one bullet missing from Clark's gun when we found him. He'd obviously taken a potshot at whoever killed him. If he'd missed, that bullet would've been lodged somewhere in that room. This really puts the finger on Fain. You're still talking about Clark I thought we passed that two hours ago. What I want to know is who-- I'm working that way, Ms. Vickers. Just be patient. When you told me that Doc objected to you're seeing Fain now I was dead sure they'd had an argument on that score. Now I'm just assured that isn't the reason your brother was killed. What other reason could anybody have had? I think your brother was murdered because he knew something he shouldn't have known. What could Doc have known about Fain? They only met the night before. I'll explain that later. But don't build your hopes up. Even if I'm right, we're gonna have a job proving it. What time are you supposed to meet Fain? - 8:30. - Alright. Now here's where you'll come in if you're willing to take a chance. - Take a chance? - I mean just that. It might be dangerous, you could get hurt. But if it works out the way I think it will Mr. Fain will set his own trap, but good. [instrumental music] Number 32. Red, the winner. I think your wheels are crooked, Mr. Fain. At these prices, you shouldn't complain. I guess I've had enough. Cash these in, will you, Johnny? 500. There you are. Come on outside and I'll buy you a drink. We could still see the last show. Now you run along, I'll join you in a minute. There are lot of men on the loose out there. Someone might pick me up. That would be mistake for some man. Don't be long. [crowd applauding] [instrumental music] Look, Marty I may be wrong, but I think you're playing with trouble. - Linda? - That's right. ♪ The night we said goodbye ♪ I may be wrong, but I think you worry too much. Okay, but I'd like to have a dollar for every idea she has in her head. You'd be a rich man. She's a bright girl. Those aren't the ideas I'm talking about. Would it upset you if I kept an eye on her? I'd be upset if you didn't. That's what I'm paying you for, remember? ♪ A kiss ♪ ♪ That brought a sigh ♪ ♪ The stars will remember ♪ ♪ So will I ♪ ♪ And now the stars and I ♪ ♪ We share the lonely lane ♪ ♪ But in my solitude ♪ ♪ It seems I hear you call ♪ ♪ My name ♪ ♪ The world may.. ♪ Bourbon over ice, please. ♪ As time goes passing by ♪ ♪ But stars will remember ♪ ♪ So will I ♪ ♪ The stars will remember ♪ ♪ So will I ♪♪ [audience applauding] [instrumental music] May I have a pencil and paper, please? [music continues] Waiter. Will you give this to Ms. Toni Peters, please? [music continues] It's addressed to Toni. See that she gets it. - Now I give up. - Use your head for a change. If Linda doesn't get an answer, she'll know something's funny. As long as Toni says the right things we've nothing to worry about. Don't worry about Toni. She only knows one language, mine. [music continues] Where's that drink? [chuckles] Coming up. Will you build one of these for Mr. Fain? You know, someone should do something about the liquor I serve in this place. [gasps] Oh, thank you. Well, I.. Taking all this time to get a match-note? Jealous? Sure, I'm Jealous. What does it say? I've always wanted to learn how to write one of those things. That is in cricket, Mr. Fain. Where's your old school tie and all that sort of thing? That must be quite a communique. As a matter of fact it was very disappointing. [instrumental music] [whirring] What will you have this time, sire? How about some Brahms? I have a wonderfully dreary little piece of his. I need something to keep me awake. You're turning me into a lounge lizard. [telephone ringing] Here, choose your own poison. Hello. Yes, speaking. Oh, yes. How are you? Yes, of course. When can I see you? No, I couldn't today. I'm busy. Oh, I see. Well, uh, what would be the best time for you? Oh.. No, I don't mind at all. It stopped raining. Alright. What is it? Fine. 2:30. Right. Alright. Goodbye. If I run off and leave you for a while would you miss me? Till it hurts, why? Where're you going? I have to make a short call. It's a friend of mine, she isn't feeling well. - I'll go with you. - Don't be silly, darling. You stay here and be comfortable. That sounds like a fast brush. Don't be sensitive, darling. I'll be back before you know it. Goodbye. [instrumental music] [music continues] [sighs] [tires screeching] Where's Sparky? I'm trying to find him all over town. I don't know. What's up? I think our little trustee decided to do some singing. Maybe we're not too late to show her the error of her ways. Come on. [music continues] See if you can open it. [dramatic music] Have a look around. Well, look what I found. Oh, it's you. I thought it was someone else. - 'Well, what do you know?' - Hello. How did you know I was here? I just took a guess. - Where's Toni? - That's what I was wondering. Looks like she moved out in a hurry. - All of her things are gone. - So, I see. - Where did she go? - How should I know? Don't be coy. Maybe you're this department, honey and again maybe you're not. Come on out with it? Where's Toni? What do you want me to say? She went to Atlantic City for some salt water taffy? I'm not in the mood for comedy. - What did she tell you? - Who? Well, she wants to be coaxed. See if you can help her out. I was born for nothin' else. Alright, I'll tell you. You usually pay pretty high prices, Marty. - But this time I outbid you. - Get to the point. Sure. I'll give it to you in a vest-pocket edition. You killed Nelson Clark. Only before he died he took a shot at you. When you got back to the club Sparky asked Doc to take care of you. Right, so far? You haven't lost your radar, keep going. Doc took the bullet out of you, alright. He was that kind. He couldn't even see a rat suffer. Pass over the footnotes, just give me the text. When you tried to buy Doc off he wouldn't sell so you cracked your little whip and your trained seal went into his act. - That's you, adorable. - Very funny. Is that all? Except, when you found out Toni knew a little something. Working her over was where you made your mistake. Made her curious. When a woman gets curious there's nothing she can't find out. - Do you believe all that? - What do you think? - 'Got a better story?' - Yes, I have. I didn't kill Clark. I don't know who killed your brother. And even if I'd done all these things how would Toni had found out? I'll tell you a secret. Do you really wanna know where Toni went? She went to Canada. Do you know who she went with? She went with Sparky. Now does it make sense? Well, why didn't you go to the police if you thought they were on the level? I said this time it's for keeps. I love you. That's why I didn't go to the police. It sounds good anyway. It's better than that. Do you need any more proof than this? Toni got you a gun so that the police could use it for a ballistics test. That's the clincher. Is this is gift? And now that your story would lay a big fat egg. You know that? You're hard to convince, Marty. I may have to marry you. You know a wife can't testify against her husband. [instrumental music] The only thing you ever said that made sense was that you and I had the same standards. I didn't realize how right you were. I'm rotten, I can't help it. I didn't ask to fall in love with you. It's just that I'm irresistible, huh? I don't like her line, Marty. [music continues] - What'd I tell you? - How did that get here? You're not very good at this sort of thing, are you? Marty, I swear I didn't know about it. You're not very reassuring. But now that we're a cozy little threesome again I'll admit you almost had it right. Almost. You see, I did knock off Clark. - But I didn't kill Doc. - Take it easy. I sent Cliff out to bargain with him. Doc got rough, in the scuffle Cliff accidently shot him. You're pretty free with your chatter. Look, as long as I've got this gun there's no case. Anyway, I said it was an accident. Grab those reels. Linda and I got to get things straightened out if we're gonna get along. You're straight as I'd ever want them. I don't think a man and his wife should have secrets. Do you, Linda? Come on, we're clearing out of here. Where're we going? Some place where we can get a fresh start. 'I've got a place up in the mountains.' 'Nice and quiet.' We'll be all alone. Someday I'll learn to keep my mouth shut. [instrumental music] - Marty, I.. - Relax, Linda. You need a vacation. [music continues] You should've gone in for radio, Fain. - You got a great voice. - Thanks. But it doesn't take so well in a wire recorder. Maybe not. But it sure sounded beautiful over that microphone 'we had planted in the ventilator.' I told you to keep your mouth shut. I underestimated you, Linda. Just leave a woman to her own devices. You should put her on the payroll, McReady. Alright, Ms. Vickers come on down. Stay where you are, Ms. Vickers, I like this arrangement. Don't be a fool. That won't help any. I'll take my chances. Tell him to leave the girl alone, Fain or I'll open fire and start on you. Let her go. You buy your chips, I'll buy mine. Don't make matters worse. We could still get out of this. How much worse can it get? Let's get chummy, Ms. Vickers. Take it easy, Martin. You're wide open. Now drop that gun. I hope you look good with wings. [gunshots] [dramatic music] - You're okay, Mc? - I don't know. I hope so. Yeah, she's alright. A little shaken up, but she's alright. Relax, you sound like her father who just had twins. Why don't you go and call the wagon? [music continues] Hello, lieutenant. [ambulance door closes] Easy there. Sorry, I'm a little ragged around the edges. Of course, you are. That was quite an ordeal. I wouldn't wanna make my living at it. [music continues] In his own way, I suppose Marty tried to even things up a little by saving my life. Maybe he was currying favor favor with St. Peter. Why not give him the benefit of the doubt? It doesn't cost anything. [music continues] Now that this whole thing has cleared up what're you gonna do? Go on living just like everybody else. Get a job, maybe. I'm not sure. Why? I was just wondering. Things may seem pretty rough for a while and.. Well, if there's anything I can do I'd like to help. [sighs] You're a nice guy, lieutenant. Thanks. If you don't need me for anything I'd like to take a walk. Sure. Go ahead. Well, Mc, are you riding or walking? [music continues] Meet you at headquarters in an hour. [chuckles] Linda. [music continues]
