Where'd you find that? Promise you'd quit. Yeah. Yeah, it's not so easy, you know. Wait, why are you awake, Charlie? Bad dream. Me, too. Do you want to talk about it? Put that down, please. Come on, that's not a toy. Come on. What's going on, sweetie? Daddy? Hmm? Something feels weird. In my body. I think we should go talk to your mom about this. Uh, you know. Not that thing. - The other thing. - The other thing. The bad thing. Something's changing. You remember your tools? If you ever get nervous, if you're ever scared... ...you start to lose control, what do you do? Flowers. Clock. See, uh, forest. Bunny. And sweet Charlie. The bad thing... it's been gone a long time. You're strong, Charlie. So you don't have to be afraid. All right. Hey. Is everything okay in here? Yeah. Yeah. Peachy. I'm really hungry. Who wants pancakes? Pancakes? You want pancakes? - I want pancakes. - No, you don't like pancakes. Blueberries, what else? Chocolate? - Mm-hmm. - Chocolate? - Yeah. - What else do you want? Um... - Strawberries. - Coffee. - Coffee? Black coffee? - Orange juice. Thank you so much - for coming in today. - Mm-hmm. How are you enjoying college so far? Uh... I'm having fun. It's busy. Kind of more work than I thought. I'm kind of homesick. I'm just gonna ask you a few questions here. - It's kind of background stuff. - Okay. Ever used hallucinogenic drugs? Too scared. Uh... I mean, it's college, man. You know? How about your father's blood type? Do you know your parents' blood types? You know what? I don't. Fair enough. Where do your parents live? They don't. They died when I was ten. Says here you were raised in a group home. Is that correct? Indeed, I was, uh, from the time that I was seven. Numbers are in the threshold, but let's keep an eye on it. Telekinetic spikes. Confirming here, too. Why do you need to know so much about my parents? Genetic history. It helps us understand and evaluate the test results. Slightly erratic, but, uh, it's okay. We need to drop his levels to five... The ad said that this was just an FDA clinical trial. Half of the people will be getting injections of water, and the other half will get water mixed with a chemical compound that we call "Lot Six." A chemical compound? Like what? What is it? But half of us are just gonna get the placebo, right? Either way, it's entirely harmless. Well, how do you know? I mean, that's why you're testing it, right? My next question here is a little weird. Can you tell me if you've ever had what you would call an authentic psychic experience? I'd rather not talk about that. Okay, let's make sure we're recording her numbers here. Confirmed telekinetic activity. I don't like these questions, man. Just part of the evaluation. Let me ask you again. Have you ever experienced any inexplicable phenomena that goes against natural law? I saw my parents die in a car wreck. I'm sorry to hear that. But what about that makes it inexplicable? I saw it a week before it actually happened. The readings are erratic! Turn it off. We need to unhook him now! Turn that camera off! - Get him out of here. - I still see it. Hold him down! Turn it off. Turn it off! My service guarantees that after just three sessions, your nicotine cravings will disappear. And all we do is talk? Sounds crazy, right? It's not. - It's magic. - Okay. Uh, uh, I don't know, Mr. McGee. Well, call me Andy. Andy, uh, a hundred dollars per session... Yeah, that's a lot for my budget. Let's just try it. One session. If you don't walk out of here today feeling better than you've ever felt, with these nicotine cravings already starting to fade, it's on the house. Now, close your eyes. Keep 'em closed. Good. Now, imagine the Darla that you want to be. Picture her. Smoke-free. A beacon of respiratory health. Now look at me in the eyes. Don't look away. No matter what. You feel better about yourself already, Darla. Healthier. More positive. Healthier. You hate the taste of tobacco. More positive. And that stale cigarette smell makes you want to puke. You are done with smoking. You know, I... I feel better already. What? Wow. Healthier, more positive. - Wow. - Mm-hmm. Okay, um... Okay, I have 75, but I can... I can give you a credit card if you... No, it's-it's cash only, so that's fine. -I'll just take what you have now. -Oh. -Yeah? -Yeah. I'm sure you're good for the rest. Oh. I am indeed. Thank you. Wild. Take care. Ew! Nice work, goober. How is it going over here, Gavin? - Weird girl killed our frog. - It was already dead. Yeah, but now it's extra dead. That's okay, Charlie. A quick Google search will show you all the frog guts you want dissected perfectly. We don't even need to do this anymore. I don't have Google. Quiet, class. I forgot. Sorry. You ever go to the public library? You can use the computers there. Too much screen time can cause health problems in children, like insomnia. I think a little screen time would be just fine. Help with your grades, too. Okay. Now that we dissected our frogs, let's go back to the diagram and compare it with what we saw. - Now, notice the liver... - Hey. Is it true that Amish families share the same bathwater? 'Cause that's weird. And you're weird. Notebook. Pencil. Desk. Shoes. Paper. Eraser. Calculator. Everything okay, Charlie? Yes, Ms. Gardner. Charlie. Is everything okay in here? I don't want to go to school. We just want you to have a normal life. I want stupid Wi-Fi. That's normal. That stuff rots your brains. Do you really believe that? Mm-hmm. Plus, it's expensive, you know? Monthly bills, smart phones. We just, you know... we can't afford it right now. Sorry. It happened again. The bad thing. This boy made fun of me. He called me weird. You're not weird. I'm worse. No. No. You're special. I knew it the day that you were born. You were warm and toasty like a buttery muffin. Hmm? Are you scared of me? I could never be scared of you. Come here. Three years. We got... we got too comfortable. I just don't get it. Like, why now? What's the trigger? She's not in puberty. Is she? No. Oh, God. It really scared her when it happened. Maybe she needs to be scared, Vick. - She needs to be trained. - Oh, my God. Our responsibility is getting her ready. Making her strong in case they come. Our responsibility is to protect her. Training her is protecting her. Says the one who hates her power so much, - she won't even use it. - Wha... It's different for us. We know what it's like... Be normal? But when you're born this way... She's not a robot. She's a little girl. With little girl feelings and emotions, which are wildly unpredictable. It's too dangerous. She just has to shove it down and keep it hidden. She did it before. She can do it again. Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Loser. Let's go. You okay, Charlie? Weirdo. Yeah, run away, you freak. Charlie? Charlie? Charlie? What the... Please. Charlie? Whatever's going on... Charlie? Please leave. Charlie? Holy sh-shit. I was in the east end, uh, of the school... It won't happen again. How can you be so sure? Does Charlie have a history of destructive behavior? No, of course not. She's been less than forthcoming about how she did it. What she used to cause the explosion. Please don't call it an explosion. It makes her sound like a terrorist. The bathroom stall exploded, ma'am. What would you like us to call it? Regardless, the police want to investigate the matter further. That blast was like a siren call. I know you don't want to hear this, but none of this would have happened if she knew how to use it. Jesus. Look at my eyes. Every time I try to do it, it-it chips away at me now. I can't do the push without my eyes literally bleeding now. Why didn't you tell me? Come on. But that doesn't mean it will happen to Charlie. That's not a risk I'm willing to take. I don't have your power. Okay? I can't push her if she loses control. Well, I would never push my own kid. Our cover is blown, okay? If they catch her, they're gonna lock her away. They're gonna run tests on her for the rest of her life. They're gonna take her, they're gonna put her in a cage. We'll never see her again, Vick. Who knows what's gonna happen to her? If who catches me? You're supposed to be in your room, Charlie. You were yelling. Charlie, I need you to go to your room right now, okay? And pack a bag. We're leaving in the morning. Sweetie, do you think... Are we bad people, Charlie? Mm-mm. Do you know why we have to move all the time? Hmm? Because of your work. But also because bad men are after us. Really bad. Because of the special things that we can do, the pushing and the fire. And if they catch us, they're gonna put us in jail. It's why we can't have cell phones or Wi-Fi. Because they can track it. I'm sorry we lied to you. But I ran to the bathroom so I wouldn't hurt anyone. That was the right thing to do, Charlie. That was, that was right. I tried to throw it in the water, but it didn't work. And now we're in trouble and we're going to jail, and it's all my fault. Okay, you got to stay calm. - Calm down, Charlie. - Just stay calm, sweetie. - You're okay. - I'm not okay. Stop saying that. And I'm not special! I'm a monster! - You are not a monster. - You just need to calm down. - I'm a monster. I'm a monster. - You're not. -Calm down. - You're not a monster. - I'm a monster. I'm a monster! Charlie. I hate living like this! Tough luck, Charlie! This is who you are! Please, Andy. Stop. You made me this way. Charlie, please! I hate who I am, and I hate you! Charlie! Charlie! You're all right. Oh, God. I'm really sorry, sweetie. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry. - Charlie. Charlie, no. Charlie, no. Charlie. Charlie, no. I'll be okay. She's okay. 911. What is your emergency? See? She's fine. - Come on. Please. - Hello? Hello? Are you there... Okay. It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. It's all right. Is this Rainbird? Yes. This is Captain Jane Hollister, DSI. I'm reactivating you, Rainbird. If that would be of interest. Course it's still the cleaning up other people's shit, just not literally. I left that life. Yeah, and how's that working out for ya? I know what happened. Shop used you up and threw you out like unwanted trash. And that wasn't right. But that was the old guard. I'm the new. Something's happened, Rainbird, and I need it handled with discretion. I understand that was your specialty. What is the target? Something for which you are uniquely qualified. But unlike the others, I need this quarry back alive. Is that something you can handle? Good job. Good job. There we go. - You okay? - Ow. Ow. Ow. Oh. Vick, this is bad. Oh, fuck. Almost done. That's it. You could've pushed her. We have no idea what's happening when I'm going into those people's minds, moving things around. Why would you ever want me to do that to Charlie? - What if I mess her up? - And if she kills one of us? Don't fucking go there. Andy. This is what happens when you stuff it down. It doesn't go away. Can you take her to the movies or something, please? Ice cream or something? - Just get some rest, okay? - Okay. Vicky McGee? I'm just following up on an emergency call from earlier tonight. Oh, yeah. It was a grease fire. On the stove. My daughter overreacted. If you or your daughter need help... It's nothing like that. Honestly. You're sure about that, you have a good night, then. Oh, Charlie. Ow. Where did they go? Your husband and the girl. Ice cream. Movies. Ice cream... or the movies? Did you think you were unique? Before they tested their poison on pretty, young coeds, they had to use lab rats. And you're out of practice. How could you work for them? Help them after what they did to you? Come peacefully, and you'll live. I will die before I let them have her. Your life, to them, is a secondary concern. And yours? When you see her, you'll understand. And you will regret. Do you think she'll forgive me? Well, she's your mom. She'll always forgive you. No matter what. It was supposed to be you. What? It was supposed to be you. I feel weird. Mm, too much rocky road. She's probably asleep. I'm gonna go check on her, okay? Here, take that to the trash. And then throw on your pj's, all right? Surrender. - Charlie? - Daddy? No one gets hurt. Let her go. You know what it costs, don't you? To hurt someone. To take a life. Would you ask that of your own child? Do you feel that? Let her go, or it's gonna get a lot worse. Where's Mommy? She has no aim without sight if she's like the rest of us. Where's my wife? Where's Mommy? I don't know, sweetheart. Yes, you do. Where's Mommy?! Tell me now! Mom? Run. Run, Charlie! - Run! - Mommy! Come on. We have to get somewhere safe. Dr. Wanless, you have a guest. Good morning, Joseph. I brought you something. Your favorite colors, too. I'm Captain Hollister, newly appointed DSI. Why are you here? Hmm, Captain? I made calls to your predecessor. They went unanswered. Hmm. But now they stuff a new face into the same old suit, and that face just comes knocking on my door! With all due respect, Doctor, Captain McConnell doesn't have the legs for this outfit. Completely oblivious to the dire nature of the situation we've created! We found them. Joseph. Shall we talk? When you see her, you'll understand. And you will regret. I miss you, Mommy. I'll get 'em. Oh, hi. Hi, kitty-kitty. Hi. Come here, kitty-kitty. Come here. It's okay. Don't run away. Come on. It's okay. I'm nice. I won't hurt you. Charlie? Charlie? He scratched me. Honey, he's in pain. You have to put him out of his misery, all right? I really didn't mean to. I know you didn't. I know. This is what it costs, though. 'Cause it can't be a reaction like that. It's got to be a... A decision. That's the only way you can control it. You can do it. Good job. I want to help her. You want to use her. The girl... She can't help what she is. She... the poor thing, she's been brain-fucked from birth. This is a chance to turn a past failure into present success. I want you to come back to work, Dr. Wanless. How hard must it have been for them? The parents, when the girl was born. The bottle is late, the baby cries, and a teddy bear bursts into flames. Right there. In the crib beside her. Can you imagine their fear? And it's awful. That's really... What's your point? The girl's power is in its infancy. Terrible, yes, but trivial compared to what's coming. But she's growing, our little girl. She's becoming a young woman. And someday soon, the power will grow, too. Perhaps it already has. And then, one day, she may be capable... ...of creating a nuclear explosion simply with the force of her mind. Doctor, we built a facility especially for people like Charlie. We can teach her. We can train her. You can exploit her. Don't you lecture me on morality. You developed Lot Six. You gave it to those kids. And it was a mistake! Well, that's too fucking bad! It's done! Jesus fuck... We're not gonna clone her. We're not gonna make a little army of Charlies. We just, we... We want to understand her. She's the first of her kind. And no one understands her better than you, the man who made the serum. You're the father of it all. What do you say? There are none so blind as those who will not see. What? Heed my words... very carefully. Terminate the girl, or one day she will destroy us all. Do you hear me? Terminate her. I hoped this would've gone better. That's good. Can we pray? Yeah. Sure, we can pray. All right. Dear God, please let this... cat be happy in cat heaven. And, um, just, you know, make sure that-that he, uh... or she... ...or they, it's like a big cat party in cat heaven. And bless Mommy, too. Bless Mommy, too. You know what Mom wanted you to learn more than anything in the world? She wanted you to learn to use your power. Because it's incredible. And I bet if you have her powers, you... ...probably have mine, too. - The push? - Yep. It's serious stuff, Charlie. That's why Mom wanted to teach you, to help you understand how to use it. If you do it too much, it'll really hurt you. But I don't feel the heat when it happens. It hurts you on the inside, I mean. Actually... it feels kind of good. Why can't we drive our own car? Because they're looking for us. They won't really put us in jail. Not you. They'll study you. Like the frog. Yeah. Yeah, like the frog. Here's one. Oh, come on, please. Yes! Okay. Do you really think this is safe? Right now, I think we have to get off this road. So... Come on. We'll be smart. Be clever. Let's go. Oh, man. I didn't think anyone was gonna stop. There's a lot of weirdos around these parts. You one of 'em? No, no, no, we're very normal. Y... Uh, tell the nice man your name, sweetheart. I'm Roberta, but they call me Bobbi. Yeah, we're headed up to Boston. My car broke down a ways back. Boston's a hell of a walk from here. Yeah, I know. We really got to get there. Is there any chance you can take us? To Boston? I'll cover your gas. I got things to do. I got to check up on my wife. What about a hundred bucks? One hundred bucks. Well, I'm not above a Benjamin. Climb in. Hey, it's lunchtime. The wife and I usually put out a little sandwich spread about now. Why don't you come to the house and-and fuel up for a bit? I don't know. We... My wife's waiting. But Bobbi needs to eat. Yeah. Coming up. Come on in. Let's get some food in your bellies. Would it be okay if I played with your chickens? Just watch out for the turds. Yeah, sure. - Stay close, all right? - Yep. Try not to cook any of them. Essi! We're home. Got some guests for supper, Essi. Little Bobbi and her dad... I don't think I caught your name. Frank. Bobbi and Frank. Cold beer? Yeah, sure. Why not? Thank you. So, what do you do, Frank? To keep the lights on. I'm a life coach. No shit. - Like Tony Robbins on TV? - No. No, not really like that, but... - I saw that documentary on Netflix. Old Tony cusses like a son of a bitch, but folks seem to like him. People will give you their life savings just to tell them they're special. - Life coach? - Yeah. Man. The whole world goin' to hell. Hello? Is anyone in there? What's your name? Essi. Hi, Essi. I'm Charlie. I'm here with my dad. Hey! How did you...? Don't go disturbing Essi! She needs quiet! Hey, we're really sorry. You've been more than kind. Come on. We should probably get going. Where you headed? And how you getting there? I don't know. Hey, look, I... I overreact sometimes. Especially with the missus. I apologize. Oh, how rude of me. Come on. Essi, this is Frank. And I guess you already met Roberta. She was making a left turn out on Route 14, and some a-hole ran a light. She never saw it coming. I'm so sorry. We lost our boy that day, too. But Essi's still alive, and for that, I'm more than grateful. You can stay here till you go. We'd enjoy the company. Will they find us? You let me worry about that. The most important thing we can do is just keep running. If they do, I can hurt them. I'll only hurt bad people, I promise. The day you were born. Do you remember that story? Mommy said I was a buttery muffin. Oh, my gosh, you were. You were just a little buttery muffin. There's more to that story. It was so cute how warm you were, but pretty soon, your body temperature just went... Shot off the charts. And the doctors, they were all... they were all confused. They were, uh... They didn't know what could cause this, so we stayed up with you all night. All day. I could barely keep my eyes open. I was falling asleep everywhere. And that's when they took you. I used to get these premonitions, this really weird, weird feeling. Like how I did at the house. Mm-hmm. I could sense where you were. I could see you. And I found you. What did you do? I was so angry at what they had done, I snapped. When your partner comes back, you're gonna shoot him in the chest. And then you're gonna forget how to breathe. And I hurt those men. And those guys, they probably had wives. Kids. That they loved. Just like I love you. And I do, Charlie. I love you so much. But when you hurt people... ...you don't just hurt them. It hurts everyone around them. You don't come back from that. Not ever. Okay, promise me that you'll never use your gifts to hurt people. Promise? Promise. Now, sleep. Get some sleep, all right? Come here. - Love you. - Love you. ...Massachusetts fugitive now suspected of killing his wife and kidnapping their 11-year-old daughter.

You'll never catch her. Lenses in. Lenses in. Containment team has arrived on site. Beginning perimeter search now. Subject's down. Everybody's down. Except him. On your knees! Move in. - Move! - Careful. He's dangerous. Give me your gun. No dice, freak. We've got protection. Any sign of her? Negative. We're checking the other structures. We found the owners inside. You lost her, Rainbird. You left a trail of dead cops in your wake. You call that discretion? You have the father. So she's just gonna what? She's gonna feel her way here? They are connected. She will come for him. Retirement has made you sloppy and soft. Is that why you blindfold me? I don't need to see your eyes to feel your fear. You don't know what I feel. She will come for him. She will come for us all. She is my sister. My mother. Well, you killed her mother. She will be your death. A fate which I deserve. When you see her, you will understand. Where are you, Daddy? Tell me. Rise and shine, Mr. McGee. Or is it Mr. Burton? Mr. Rozelle? No more pseudonyms, Cooper. No more running. It's just you and me now. Wake up. Rainbird... the man who killed your poor wife... He believes that you and your daughter, you have some kind of a spiritual connection. Telepathy. Lot Six is full of surprises. Tell me where she is. Charlie is out there all alone. Without you, her emotions will get the best of her. And what happens when she gets upset? She gets scared. She is going to blow some poor bastard to smithereens. She's gonna be killing people. How's she gonna live with that? Bring her here. What other choice do you have? Charlie. Charlie. Daddy? I'm coming, Daddy. I'll find you. - What happened to your clothes? - What happened to your face? Don't you ever bathe, weirdo? I'd like your bike. Please. The hell are you doing, Dale? Which way is the coast? The coast, dummies, where the water is. So let me know - what the final numbers are. - All right, will do. I mean, how's the nausea today? Sorry, babe. I mean, first trimester's almost over, right? The light at the end of the tunnel. - Yeah. All right. I'll see you when I get home. Love you. Bye. It's you. Take your hand off the key. Give me your phone. And the card. Do you have a gun... - ...Agent Jules? - No. Uh, I'm just a tech. They don't let us carry guns. This says you're an agent. We're all agents. It's just... just a title. Is my father inside? I don't know. - Is he? - I don't know. I swear, okay? I don't have that kind of clearance. I don't want to hurt you, sir. Please, why are you doing this? Is my father inside? I don't know! Okay? Stop. Please. If he's here, he'll be, uh, he'll be at the bottom. Who else is in there? Computer techs, s-scientists, uh, that kind of thing. No long-haired men? Answer me! Please, just... Okay, just stay calm. - We can work something... - Tell me! No! You said you didn't have a gun. I don't want to hurt anyone. I promised. He's in pain, Charlie. You'll have to put him out of his misery. This is what it costs. What's going on? Ah, shit. We got a disturbance in the east lot. All units stand by. She's inside the building. Clearing her path to the restricted level now. What the...? Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Daddy. She's on the restricted level. Oh, come on. She's headed your way, B team. Asset moving down hallway 12. Passing her off to beta team. We've got her. Target visual acquired. Securing hallways and doors behind her. She's all yours, Cap. Daddy! Daddy, wake up! Daddy, wake up. Charlie? Wh-Why-Why are you here? I came. I got your message. That wasn't me, Charlie. I would never bring you here. That wasn't me. - But I can get you out. - No. No, Charlie. There's no getting out. - There's no getting out for me. - Charlie. It wasn't supposed to be this way. Wasn't supposed to be this difficult. Stay calm, dear. If you try to burn me, you'll burn your daddy, too. My name's Captain Hollister, but you can call me Cap. I run this facility. You can trust me, Charlie. You'll be safe here. You'll be protected. We'll take really good care of you and your father. My dad needs a doctor. They've seen him already, Charlie. Microhemorrhages. His brain bleeds when he uses his power. The same thing could happen to you, too, Charlie, but we can teach you. - It's what your mother wanted. - No. No. Call a doctor right now, or I'll hurt myself. Don't do it, Charlie. Don't do it. Call a doctor right now. Do it! You're a very determined young lady. Use it wisely, it'll take you far in this life. I should know. You do bad things here. I can feel it. No, we-we do great things. We make things better here. We-we make people better. We make them stronger, people like you. Haven't you realized? You are a real-life superhero. Daddy. You're very special. The world out there...
