Thanks for today. Say, do you still have time? Yes. [ I'm glad that I am myself ] [ To Our Dearest Mamizu Watarase From All of 2nd Year Class D ] You're the only one who hasn't written anything. But I haven't even met her. Everyone's like that. She has the luminescence disease? The one who's the last to write that is required to visit and give that to her. No way. Are you close with Kayama? Not really. Luminescence disease. It is an incurable disease that is still unexplainable even today. As there is no effective treatment of it, the patients are subject to clinical research. The most prominent characteristic of it is that the skin emits light due to cell abnormality. It is said that the skin's brightness becomes stronger as death approaches. - Excuse me. - Yes? Where is room 217? The people with luminescence disease cannot survive till adulthood. Are you Mamizu Watarase? Yes. Who are you? Takuya Okada. I'm your classmate ever since spring started. Right... New semester started. Nice to meet you. I'm Mamizu Watarase. Ah, you see... I came here to give you this. "I hope you get better soon." "Takuya Okada" Don't you think this message is somewhat cold? Huh? Could it be that you actually didn't intend to visit me? Like you were forced by the teacher? Well... I came on my own. Really? Yeah. I see. I'm glad. [ I hope you get better soon. - Takuya Okada ] [ Kimi wa Tsukiyo ni Hikarikagayaku You Shine in the Moonlit Night ] Don't you think that looks pretty? Dad gave me this a long time ago. But I don't see him any more. Ah... Sorry. It's boring, isn't it? No... It looks fun. You sure are kind. Who is he? Your friend? He's Takuya. He said we're classmates. I see. Anyway, I'll get going then. Okay. I'll be leaving right away after I measure her blood pressure though. No, it's okay. Thank you. Will you come again? Ah, wait. Bye. Wasn't she cute? Ah, you mean Watarase? I see. You still call her "Watarase" right now. Do you know her? Yeah, we've met before. How was her condition? Beats me. She looks healthy though. [ I want to eat gummies ] You came?! Sorry... Are you okay? Are you hurt? It can't be helped. Everything that has a form eventually breaks. I feel like I’ll be able to die feeling more relieved if I don’t have anything that’s important to me. You know, actually, my life expectancy is zero. Around this time last year, I was told that I have a year left. Then a year passed as normal. To top it over, I'm quite healthy. I wonder when I'm going to die? I wonder when I'm going to die...? Right. Here. Ah! So you bought it for me? So you intended to apologise from the start. I'll do something about it. It's okay. This is enough. No. I want to properly atone for what I did. Atone? Will you really do anything? As long as I can do it... Ah... Huh? I suddenly have a great idea. I want you to do the things that I want to do as my proxy. "Proxy"? Yeah. I have loads of things I want to do. But I can't get out of the hospital. You do it in my place and tell me your impressions. That will be your atonement. What should I do? Even just only once, I wanted to ride a roller coaster. Thank you for waiting. Will there be three people riding? I'm alone. Then the two of you, please take your seats here. Please place your things under your feet. Please fasten the yellow belt and wait. It's perfect! He started sobbing... I wanted to eat a parfait that I would be so full. Here is your "Our First Love Parfait"! So big! And it's called "Our First Love Parfait". They are matching... I see! I guess one can't really go alone to amusement parks. Hey. You're really good at telling stories. I picture them. No way. Anyway, what will I ask you to do next. Wait. There are more? Yup. I want you to do all these. Which should I pick next. This would be too much... Wait, wait. What? You know, Isn't it meaningless that you ask someone else what you wanted to do? I have no choice. I can't get out of the hospital. My condition is pretty bad. You said the other day you're quite healthy. Ah! - This will finally be out tomorrow... - Buy that for me next! I won't be able to buy it without lining up... I always wanted to try waiting in an all-night queue. You just thought of it just now, didn't you? Were are you going this late? I'm just going out for a bit. That's what Meiko said that day when she went out. What happened to Meiko was only a car accident. Don't talk like that! Sorry. I'm going to be alright. I'm off. Say, Takuya. I wonder when I'm going to die...? [ When your loved one dies, you have to commit suicide. ] Wow. How is it? I'm finally part of the civilisation. Could it be that I'm only an errand boy? It'll be easier to contact you from now on using this. [ Mamizu Watarase: Thanks ] [ Thanks. ] [ - T: You're welcome. - M: You see... - M: I have a favour to ask next. - T: What? ] [ I want you to visit Dad. ] I want you to visit Dad. I want to hear the truth why he divorced. Excuse me. Coming. Um... I'm Okada. I'm the classmate of Mamizu. Did something happen to Mamizu? We divorced two years ago. I've heard. Mamizu wanted to know the reason. My ex-wife didn't love me at all. She drove me out. Mamizu doesn't believe you. She said it might be because of her illness. That's not true. She wants to see you. I can't do that. It's a promise to my ex-wife. Why don't you see her? To think she might not live long. I'm not allowed to see her. Our company plunged and was forced for personal bankruptcy. In order to leave enough money for her medical fees, I divorced by paper. Could that mean it's a divorce in disguise? Yes. That's why once the debt collectors know, we won't be able to pay her medical bills. Thank goodness. So they didn't divorce because they were bad terms with each other. Huh? But that would be good if only his daughter's illness will be cured. But it won't be cured in the end though. I'm just making everyone around me miserable. That's not true. If only I wasn't even born in the first place. I've become troublesome to you, huh? To think you got entangled in something as bothersome like this. Thanks for many selfish things I asked you to. It's enough already. What do I need to do next? Your proxy list still have many listed, right? But didn't you hate it? I mean I don't dislike it. Takuya, you could be kind from time to time, huh? The "time to time" isn't necessary. Can you see? Yeah, I can! So that's how it looks like. There sure are a lot. Ah, I kind of like that. I'll give my own room a total makeover was my dream. I wanted to fully feel the sea breeze while riding the bicycle. I wanted to hit a home run. Go! What?! Wow! Ah, that was close. Ah! That's the home run prize. I did my best. Whoa... I wonder... Would it be so cool if I went all out singing this song? Then above! So the sky isn't real. Okay, run! Don't shake it. Okay, turn around once over there. More. Turn around faster. More! More! Faster! Faster! Don't make fun of me. Welcome back, Master. I am Riko! Um, excuse me... Welcome back, Master. Um, I'm Okada. I came here for the job interview. Ah, sorry. Please go to the back. Thank you. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okada? - Ah, yes. - Can you work as soon as now? Now? I can't get in touch with the kitchen staff. Kitchen, huh? Of course. Huh?! Don't tell me you wanted to work as a maid?! Not really... One Chick Rice please. - Chick Rice? - Can you make chicken rice? I can make chicken rice but a chick... Moe Moe Pink Curry please. I'll make the Moe Moe Pink Curry. Then I'll leave making the Chick Rice to you. Is Chick Rice just a chicken... It's just a chicken rice. Can't you make one? No, I can make a chicken rice... You just have to! Men have times when they should make one! Ah! Oh no! Good work! Ah, good work out there. How was it? Tough, right? Yeah, very. I know right. That's why many of the kitchen staff quickly quit. But still... I think I'll keep on working here, maybe... Really?! People who say that is rare. Ah... Let's go to the station together. I'll change quickly. Ms Riko. Just call me Riko. Riko, I have a favour to ask. Hm? Who is this? That's Riko. When I said I wanted a picture of a maid outfit, she became the model. I see... She's cute. Yeah. So she's cute? What? Nothing. When you said you wanted to wear a maid outfit... I want to try bungee jumping. Huh?! But that wasn't in your list. No, no, no. I won't do it. No, no. I won't! - No, I won't! I won't! - I want do it! I want to! I want to! - No, no, no... - Do it! Do it! Do it... - I won't do it, no! No... - I really want to do it! Do it... Noooo! Um, with the majority of votes, it's been decided that our class will be doing "Romeo and Juliet"! We will be asking volunteers to write the script during summer vacation. And we'll quickly start when the second semester begins. "What's in a name?" "That which we call a rose by any other name" "would smell as sweet." What's that? It's my favourite line from Juliet. I won't do Juliet. Ah... So there's that way. Hold it, wait, wait... No, don't write it, no! Wait, wait... Sorry. I'm joking. Just joking. By the way, what reward do you want for working hard for me? Reward, huh... Then... Can I ask you one thing then? Okay. What is your bra size? Huh?! Are you kidding me?! - Then your weight? - That's private! - Your height? - I don't know. - Your birthday? - Secret. It's okay just to tell your birthday. August 10. What's the size of your feet? 24.5. That's quite big. Maybe you're head got weird because of bungee jumping. But thanks. My regrets of not doing it has decreased again. What will you do once the last one has been done? Of course you don't actually think you want to die, right? I'm thinking of it every day. So you're that boy who usually visits her. I'm Okada, her classmate. Are you a class representative or something? No. Oh, I see. I'm glad that you get along with her. But I don't want you to get involved with her. Excuse me? All I'm saying is that don't give her much motivation. For her, things that would make her happy or excited would only lead to stress. If she can live longer even for just a day, there might be a cure for her ailment, right? That's why, as much as possible, I want her to be in her room as peaceful as possible. We'll have to remove that later. Okay. Is there some guy you like that's coming? Yeah, yeah. Ryoma Takeuchi will come visit me after you. I picked this up in the street awhile ago. Oh really? Then let me take it. Why don't you open it? No way... No way, no way, no way. Why?! Try putting them on. Whoa. They fit perfectly! Wow! But how?! You told me your shoe size last time. Ah... You sure have your ways. I guess so. Looks good. Yeah, it's cute. I'm.... D. You know, if the next test results are positive, I might get permission to go out. - Really? - Yeah. Is there any place you want to go? Hmm... Maybe the beach. I want to see the beach and the stars wearing these. Wearing heels on the beach? I guess it's okay. [ Summer Vacation Guider ] Are you going somewhere on summer vacation? Well, maybe the beach. The beach?! I also want to go to the beach! Let's go together! Well, I already got someone going with me. Girlfriend? Do I look like someone who has a girlfriend? Hmm... That's tricky... Riko! Coming! But I think you are okay to me. [ The results of the tests came. I can't go to the beach. ] [ Summer Vacation Guider ] No appetite? Not really... Our curry is a bit weird, huh? Weird? It's always seafood. It would be meat normally. Because it's Meiko's favourite. What you are now seeing is the current sky. Don't you feel like that the moon is larger than it looks? Tonight would be the biggest full moon of the year. It's the night of the super moon! According to National Astronomical Observatory, the moon would be closest to the Earth tonight at around 8:01PM till... Here. Thanks. You sure know that we had something like this here. That's because my sister mentioned that she used to watch the sky with your brother. Really? So you and your sister had some talks like that at your home. It's just a coincidence. Before my brother died, when he went out with your sister, I wonder what kind of stuff they talked about. I wonder. Once we found out that my brother had the luminescence disease, your sister kind of stopped coming and visit him. Wanna watch the stars with me? No, I won't watch the stars with you. Ah, tell that to my mother though. The hell with that? Thanks. Stop it right there! The visiting hours have been over for hours, you know. What do you intend to do? As you know, Ms Watarase isn't allowed to go outside. I know. She won't go outside the hospital. Still... All she does is being imprisoned here and wait till she dies. But isn't that cruel? How did you come here? I sneaked in. Are you stupid? I got scolded by Ms Okazaki. Mamizu, close your eyes. What's this all of a sudden? Just do it. Give me your hand. Hand?! Whoa! Scary! Scary! Scary! Quiet! Quiet! Are we there yet? Quiet! We've walked far already. Quiet down already. Is there anyone there? - Can you put them on? - Yeah. Let me see your feet. Okay. Hm? Okay. Okay, Mamizu. You can open your eyes. Really? Huh? Wow! That's amazing, Takuya! Whoa. So pretty... Hey, try saying some romantic line. Huh? I can't do that. Observing the sky during a summer night. Charming opposite sex are besides each other. There are all these romantic factors already here. How about you say that yourself? Please. I really want it. It's alright if it's just five minutes. This is also something I want to do before I die. How about "I want to always be with you"? "I love you from the bottom of my heart"? Don't just ask me. "I'm fine dying as long as I'm with you." Are you really being serious? Don't you think it's wrong. It's not fair that I'm the only one doing it. Okay. It feels like we're the only one alone together in the world. If... That really happened, what do you want to do? Hmm... I have no choice but to marry you. What do you mean "no choice"? Hey. Try proposing to me. I will love and support you in sickness or in health. I will devote myself to you. Me too. I will always love you, Takuya. I'm just joking. That's funny, huh? Yeah. It's so stupid. Hey. I wonder if stars also have lifespans. Any star will burn out and die in the end. What will happen if they die? It seems they will lose their light and will become black holes. I don't want to be a black hole though. I love you. Mamizu. I really love you. Five minutes have already passed you know. Takuya. Mamizu. Mamizu! Mamizu! - Call the CT room. - Yes, Sir. - Have you checked the pulse and blood pressure? - Yes, Sir. Can we use the CT? Please prepare it. I'll be frank. It would have been better if you didn't come. We as her family are desperate. And we wanted her to live as long as possible even for more than a day. But I don't want you to get in her way coming here everyday. I'm very sorry. That's why, don't ever come here again... Mom. I'm sorry. It's not Takuya's fault. I forced him. But still, Mamizu... If you have to get angry, get angry only to me. Anyway, so that nothing like this reckless thing would happen again, both of you understand what you shouldn't do? - Yes, Ma'am. - Yes. I have something to tell you downstairs. Okay. Hey. If I said that I'm afraid and can't sleep, will you stay with me till morning? Tomorrow they said that they will take my spinal fluid and examine it. It's not for my treatment. For the research of this sickness, I'll become a guinea pig. Since I'm a kind and respectable person, I'll cooperate and help the future of humankind. Not just for humans but for all living things. Research for the substance called the biophoton that emits faint light. It is said that what made the balance extremely been disrupted was the luminescence disease. You see, I have a favour to ask. As long as I would be able to do it. I want to you to stop coming. Thank you for everything till now. Starting now, please forget about me. Live a happy life. What's this all of a sudden? It's not sudden. It's something I've thought for a long time. I want you to stop coming to see me. This is my last task for you. Understood? Based on the script that volunteers made during summer vacation, we will now decide who will be the cast. Then is there anyone who wants to play Juliet? I'll do it. Um, you see... we're currently deciding who will play Juliet. Can't I? Well you see, it's a role for a girl. Why not? It would be interesting like the ones at kabuki. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah! Then who will play Romeo? - I'll do it. - Oh! Oooh~ Then is it okay if Kayama will do it? Yes! Then next, who will play Tybalt? Juliet Okada. Stop calling me that. Why did you even volunteer to play the part? Because Mamizu wanted to play Juliet. She let me do things she wants to do before she dies in her place. And I report each and every one of them to her. Till summer vacation. I see. I could ask the same. Why did you volunteer the part? Because Mamizu should've played Juliet. And I'll play Romeo. During middle school, Mamizu said she'll play Juliet. Then I immediately volunteered. When our eyes met during practice, I was so happy even though I knew it's just acting. But then days before the play, Mamizu got hospitalized. I found out she had the same ailment as my brother. And I wasn't able to see her anymore. Won't you come along with me? I think it's better if you go alone. Okay. Mamizu, I wanted us to play Romeo and Juliet. And it's not the reason I'm playing it now, that's why us two are playing Romeo and Juliet. You two? I'll play Romeo, and he'll play Juliet. I... ...loved you. I understand that you should not get involved. But would you please see her? Please. I can't... do anything for Mamizu anymore. But you can. Please look at this. This is something I broke. Mamizu. Even though it's already broken, she took real care for it. Would you please go see her? I beg you. Do you love Mamizu? What if I love her? If you please. If you please. Okada. You forgot to put chocolate in the parfait awhile ago. Sorry. You've been making mistakes often lately. Something wrong? I got dumped. So you had someone liked. Hey. Why don't the two of us go somewhere together? Like an aquarium. Since we weren't able to go to the beach anyway. Hey. I'm just kidding. Just joking. Excuse me. Everyone at Class 2-D, please be on standby. Okay! So you still continued to do things in my place. Yeah. Go! Good luck! You should go with me. Ah, Romeo. why do you have to be Romeo? Just swear you love me. And if you do, I'll stop being a Capulet. Should I listen for more, or should I speak now? What does a name mean? The thing we call a rose would smell just as sweet if we called it by any other name. Romeo would be just as perfect even if he wasn’t called Romeo. Romeo, lose your name! I trust your words. Oh, Juliet! Why did you have to die? Please open your eyes once more. Please call me once more! Didn't we promise?! [ No Visitors Allowed ] May I help you? Um, I would like to ask about Ms Okazaki. Ah, she's off today. Is something the matter? I would like to ask about the patient in room number 217, Ms Mamizu Watarase. Did something happen to her? I'm sorry to ask but would it be alright to ask what is your relationship with her? I'm just her classmate. Good morning. I suddenly gotten a lot better. The doctors also said it's a miraculous recovery. I see. Ah. Let's go somewhere together after school. Is that a date? Idiot. Why are you crying? Hello? Is this Okada? Ah, yes. This is Okazaki of Osen General Medical Center. Ms Watarase wants to see you. Is Mamizu okay? But... You won't be able to see her like before. Ms Watarase has been crying often recently. She's saying "Takuya, I'm sorry" and apologizes to you. What makes her do that? I don't understand. The one who will understand her is probably only you in this world. I've been really sleepy recently. I've been sleeping a lot. Come closer. Can you still hear my heartbeat right? Yeah. I can still hear it. It's painful. I'm in so much pain. Try imagining it. If the one you love dies, it's heartbreaking. It's hard. You will never forget it for the rest of your life. That's why let's stop. Enough. Let's stop this already. Shut up. It's alright if it's heartbreaking and hard. I love you. It's too troublesome. Why? It's because I also love you, Takuya. I'm sorry to call you here. I thought that I would normally just grow up and get married. [ How to Make a Snow Dome ] To think a young man like you would come and try asking a hand for my daughter. Hey, trying asking me. What should I ask? Try asking "I ask for your blessing to marry your daughter." Come on. Go on. I ask for your blessing to marry your daughter. Hmm... Do it in one shot. Where were you? Nowhere... You've been acting strange lately. What do you mean? I'm begging you. Please don't kill yourself. I told you, what happened to Meiko was an accident. You would never understand how a mother would feel when she loses her child. I don't. But I know it's sad. I know too that you were sad when Meiko died. [ How to Make a Snow Dome ] [ Mamizu Watarase: I want to see you. ] Did you sneak in again? You told me to come, right? Are you okay? Being outside feels good. You know, I've always thought that if I'm just waiting to die like this, I think it would better if I wasn't even born. That's why, I made that list since I wanted to lose my obsession of wanting to live. So that I would be able to give up on everything. But one day, there is someone who changed me. It was you. I want to know what will happen if I continue to live after all these. I... ...want to live. I want to live, Takuya. Because of you, Takuya, I can't help but want to live. That's why please, take responsibility for it. Please continue on living in my place. I'm scared. When I continue to live after this, I would be able to forget your smiling face and your voice. I'm scared of myself with the world where you're not there and I continue to live normally. That is alright. Live. Continue to live in a world where I have passed away and live how it would have continue to change. Gaze at it, listen to it, and feel it. Please continue to tell me while I'm living inside you. This is the last task as a proxy between you and me. You must live in place of me. Would you please fulfil my last request? You could be kind from time to time, huh? The "time to time" isn't necessary. And after that, Mamizu Watarase continued to glow for 14 days... ...and disappeared. Takuya. Where are you now listening to this? Anyway, there's actually some several things I still wanted to do. First of all, please be sure to attend my funeral. Because you seem like someone who would skip it. Okada, were you close to Watarase? Yeah. She was my girlfriend. And then, I wanted you to tell everyone that I was your girlfriend. Because I want you to show off to everyone that even this poor girl who died a premature death had such a wonderful boyfriend. It's beautiful. I would not tell you to make lots of friends. But please cherish the people who are always with you. Please always get along with them. Let me tell you a secret that I always find it fun. When you do things in my place, I always felt like we were always going out on a date. Even though I was trapped in my hospital room, like a bird inside a cage, you were able to show me lovely sceneries. So that's why I decided to spend my remaining time spending with you. Instead of waiting for the remaining time of my life, even though it's short, I instead wished to live a joyous life. I've wished that time would stop when you proposed to me at the rooftop. I wished for it for the bottom of my heart. The one who gave me joy in living was you. Was the funeral you attended last time someone you knew? Yeah. Say, Takuya. Shall we go on a drive? Are you sure? Just now, Dad is talking to you on the phone. I'm sure that the end is near. I was also able to meet Dad. It's thanks to you. I'm really very happy right now. How about you? Hey, Takuya. This is really and finally my last favour to ask of you: Please be happy. I love you. I really love you. Wow, medical students sure have it tough and are very busy. Well, I think it's bad to set him as an example. Shall I send you till the station? Is it alright? You were expecting that that's why you waited, right? You're being obvious. Thank you. Come on. You sure are obvious. [ I'm glad that I am myself ]
