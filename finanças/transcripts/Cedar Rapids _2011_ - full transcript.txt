...:::: SiliconChip ::::... Cedar Rapids [2011] TIM: One of the reasons I Iove Brown Valley so much is that when you do business here, chances are good you know the person you're deaIing with. They're a neighbor or a friend or a friend of a friend. And you can trust them because they're part of a community. If there is a bad egg around, peopIe find out pretty fast. This is why BrownStar Insurance has prospered for 25 years. We aIways do right by our customers. (SlGHlNG) Kurt, Pam, this policy's gonna save you $400 a year, and it covers everything you need. Down the road, you win the lottery, come back on in here, and l'll sell you the spendiest policy we got. Seriously, guys, l'm gonna take care of you. (DOORBELL RlNGS) Hello, Mrs. Vanderhei. lt's Macy, Tim. l told you to call me Macy. Sorry, l keep forgetting. lt's a hard habit to break. Well, you better get it right soon or l'm gonna have to make you stay after school. (MACY MOANlNG) MACY: Bring it. Bring it. (EXCLAlMlNG) There you go. (EXHALES DEEPLY) TIM: Do you realize l used to just stare and stare at you when you were teaching us about the rainforests or whatever? And l would think, "l wonder what Mrs. V looks like with her clothes off." And then, boom, we run into each other in line at True Value and, boom, here we are, making love. Like, once a week. lt's like it was fate or something. Did you ever used to look at me and think dirty things? You were 1 2. Right. l got you something. (CHlRPlNG) lt's a scarlet tanager. Mmm. Like the birds you had in your classroom. That's very sweet. Thank you. Wait, wait. Look on his wing. MACY: Hmm. lsn't that pretty? ls that a... lt's a promise ring. Promising what? Well... (CHUCKLES) We're just having a good time here. No, we're not. We're having the best time. Hi, I'm Roger Lemke. At BrownStar Insurance, we endeavor to give you the coverage you need at the best prices around. It's the reason that BrownStar Insurance has been awarded the prestigious Two Diamond Award from the American Society of MutuaI Insurers for three years running. Because at BrownStar Insurance, we insure your dreams. (ALL CHEERlNG) Holy Christmas! You knocked her out of the park. You knocked it out of the G-D park, buddy! l'm just a pretty face. That copy was all you, Bill. Well, l... l do have one gripe with you, boss. Mmm-hmm? lf you'd waited till after Cedar Rapids, l could have won the Two Diamonds for you four years running. Four years! How do you it, Roger? (LAUGHlNG) So proud of you, Roggie. Mmm... TIM: Hey, Roger. Tim Lippe! l didn't even see you there. Oh, man. Did you see it? Yeah. You were so awesome. Oh ! Thanks, buddy. Thank you. Super awesome. Just... Hey, Roger. (GlGGLES) Watch your back, Brad Pitt. (LAUGHS) ROGER: Thank you for the kind words, buddy. (lNDlSTlNCT CHATTERlNG) TIM: Wow, cake. Awesome. (PHONE RlNGlNG) Hello? Tim, it's Bill. Hey, Bill. He's gone! Tim, he's gone. (CRYlNG) Oh, God, I can't beIieve it. What? It's Roger. What are you... What are you talking about? Gwen found him in the bathroom. He had a beIt tied around his neck. Oh, my gosh. He was half naked, Tim. Oh, jeez. (WHlRRlNG) BlLL: All this time, Roger was some kind of twisted deviant. TIM: Bill, the way Roger died was an accident. BlLL: (SCOFFS) Believe what you want, but people are talking, Tim. Commitment to God is a big part of the Two Diamonds. Big part. Now, people are talking. Hey, come here, come here. Here you go. This was Roger's Two Diamonds presentation. Yeah, and it's a guaranteed Two Diamond winner. And believe me, l'd go myself, but l'm locked in to my daughter's wedding over in Gladstone l got no flex. What are you saying, Bill? l am saying, you need to go down there and give this presentation, Tim. l can't go to Cedar Rapids. You can't... You don't want to send me to Cedar Rapids. All right, listen to me, you were what, 1 6, when l gave you that filing job right after your mom passed? You were living on your own, pretty much. All by yourself. And l'm thinking, "Now, here's a kid who's gonna go places." And then somehow, you just didn't. l can't. You're all l got, kid. l need you to go down there and prove that BrownStar is a good outfit, an upstanding goddamn Christian outfit. Now, the onIy thing you have to worry about getting good with is Orin HeIgesson. He's the president. He's the finaI decider on the Two Diamonds. So, near the end of the weekend, you're gonna sit down one-on-one with him in his suite and deIiver that presentation. He needs to be convinced that we're still worthy of that award. If we don't fix this, our cIients will leave us, Tim. And we'll all be out in the street. Farmers are confronted with an unpredictable risk-filled... Unpredictable world of risk-filled uncertainty. TIM: Cedar Rapids. MACY: Cedar Rapids. l can't believe that l'm actually going. But l gotta do it, right? l mean, it's not just my job. Six other people's entire livelihoods depend on this. Plus Carol, who does part-time seasonal work, so... You'll be fine. Hey, Charlie. Tim, what's up? l'm going down to Cedar Rapids for the big ASMl convention. Oh, good. Good. You can keep that for now. (CLEARS THROAT) So all liquids, gels, aerosols must be placed in a Ziploc, and then your computer, we take out of the case and run through the machine. (SNlCKERS) lt's just me. Yeah, we gotta do it for everybody, so... Tim ! Oh, praise Christ you haven't left yet. Hey, Bill. (PANTlNG) Hey. l can't believe l forgot to give this to you. lt's an ASMl bible. All right? lt'll tell you who to talk to and who to avoid, who best to fellowship with, network, you know. Dean Ziegler, Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Ziegler. You know that son of bitch called one of Lemke's biggest clients, Joyce Armbruster? Smeared Roger's name. Freaking goddang poacher. Avoid Ziegler like the plague, please. Now, Ronald Wilkes, the guy l got you rooming with, that's who l want you to stick by. Okay. All right? All right, then, come here. Come on. (lNDlSTlNCT CHATTERlNG) Well, you lucky ducks have obviously been seated in an exit row. l just need to make sure you're willing and able to assist crew members in the event of an emergency evacuation. l've actually never been on an airplane before. Well, you'll do awesome. Well, if you do need help, l'm in. Thank you. Oh, sweet. Hey, man. Can l bum a heater? What's that now? A cigarette? (CHUCKLES) No, sorry, l can't help you there. Are you here for the convention? Yeah. Yeah. Tim Lippe, BrownStar lnsurance. Bree. l'm Bree. Nice to meet you, Bree. Old trade secret for you. lf you keep smoking, your premiums are gonna go through the roof. (LAUGHS) Thanks, Dr. Phil. (LAUGHS) Hey, instead of a heater, how about butterscotch? Nice. Listen, Tim, if you wanna party, you let me know. l'm always around. You got it. Party hardy. Nice chatting with you, Bree. See you. Wow! Checking in with us, sir? Yeah, l am. Pretty excited about it, too. All right. Can l get your name? Tim Lippe. And we just need a credit card for the incidentals. Well, Trent, l was under the impression that you honored traveler's checks. You bet. We just need to make an imprint of the card, just like l say, for the incidentals. Credit card? All right. lt's standard. Don't worry. We are not gonna charge it. No, see. Looks liked you just charged it. Just an imprint. Okay. (CELL PHONE RlNGlNG) Hey, Tim. So l just did the whole check-in rigmarole, and l'm on my way to my room. Have you seen the pooI yet? Yeah. (CHUCKLES) lt's incredible. l mean, there's like palm trees and stuff. And the whole place smells like chlorine. lt's like l'm in Barbados or somewhere. Oh, here we are. Mi casa. Junior suite. Hang on a second here. Figure out how this deal works. The key is like a stinking credit card. (GASPS) What is it? Tim? There's an Afro-American man standing in my room. What's he doing? He's smiling at me. Oh, no. Run for your life. Are you Tim? Tim Lippe? l'm Ronald Wilkes. Bill Krogstad said we were gonna be roommates. Tim, are you okay? Does he speak your language? Yes. He actually seems pretty friendly so l'm gonna call you back later, okay? You are Tim? (CHUCKLES) Oh, yes, of course l am. Just for a minute there, l was like, "Whoa." Okay. You wanna come in and take a look at the room? Yeah, yeah. Check out these digs. Hey, look, Tim, the reason we got the junior suite upgrade is because the hotel overbooked. The point being, they were asking folks to take on a third roommate to consolidate space. Now, to me, the savings of adding a third guy sounded like a real positive. lf you got any qualms, l hear you. LNC. That's "Loud and Clear." Who would share... Who would share beds? That's a pull-out couch. (LAUGHS) This isn't Woodstock, Tim. l'm sure whoever it is will be a straight shooter. Janita, double stock my mini bar, please. 1 01 9, thank you. Taco Bill, back in the saddle. Hey, Ned. Get some honey on your stinger? l love it. So far, it's just the one billboard north of St. Cloud. But at the end of the day, it's NTS. Not too shabby. NTS. That's hilarious. (HOWLlNG) Ronald Wilkes, l presume. The Ronimal ! Give me some love, my soul brother! Turn down the volume, Ziegler. You just got here. What's the matter, friend? You've never seen a choco-vanilla love sandwich before? Wait till we start the butt fucking. No. (ZlEGLER LAUGHS) l'm just having fun. Dean Ziegler, Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Call me Deanzie. Tim Lippe, from Brown Valley, Wisconsin. BrownStar lnsurance. Oh, sure, yeah. Bill Krogstad's joint right? The Kroger! That's what l call him. Oh, shit. l was so sorry to hear about Lemke's passing up there. That guy was tits as a rep. Yeah. Well, Roger was just a super great man. Amen on that. Yeah. Real tragedy. Well, l don't know about you wing-nuts, but the Deanzie could use a drinksy. What do you say we head straight to Horizons for happy hour? You get two-for-one drinks, ten-cent wings, all-you-care-to-eat pussy buffet. That line was unappealing last year, Dean. lt remains so now. Ronimal ! l'm gonna watch President Helgesson's opening remarks. Oh, God. That smug fuck. Helgesson's trying to turn ASMl into a goddamn religion with all this God and morality bullshit. All right, you ladies stay here and do your nails. But l'm going to Horizon's where the action is, all right? (PEOPLE CHATTERlNG) I'm Orin HeIgesson, your ASMI Midwest Region Chapter President. If you haven't picked up your weIcome kits yet, see Mike PyIe. RONALD: Mike Pyle. He owns the sixth largest Allstate agency in the upper Midwest. The guy's a shark. l'm more worried about this Ziegler guy. l was specifically warned to stay away from him. Don't worry about him. He's harmless. I'd Iike to taIk Two Diamonds for a minute here. The Two Diamond Certificate of Excellence is awarded every year to the agency that best exempIifies the ASMI decree "to provide high quaIity insurance, "whiIe maintaining commitment to community, country and God." We have a record number of entries this year. Over 50 agencies. So... Did he say 50 agencies? Yeah, it's gonna be brutal this year. (EXHALES) Hey, come on. You're gonna do fine. Relax. Thanks. Hey, baby girl. MACY: Hey, Tim. How's it going? l'm in over my head. You'll do fine. l'm putting you on speaker, sweetie. l just really wish you had come with me. Oh, no. This is your thing. You'll do a good job. Well, I gotta run in a sec. I'm meeting some foIks for fish at the EagIes. l really miss you. You'll do fine. Thank you. I'll try. l really miss you. Okay, bye, honey. l'll dream of you in my heart. You were checking me out. What? l'm gonna have to tell the hotel there's some pervo in fitness center hitting on innocent women. What? Whoa! No. l wasn't doing that. l'm, like, pre-engaged with somebody. Unbelievable. That poor woman should know what you're up to. l'm not up to anything. l swear, l'm not... Oh, man. (LAUGHlNG) l'm totally messing with you. l'm sorry. Oh, my God, l'm such a jerk. (CHUCKLES) Okay, yeah. Well, that's different. l'm so sorry. Joan Ostrowski-Fox. Hi. Hi. Tim Lippe. Hi, Mr. Lippe. l'm in town for the ASMl convention. l'm here for ASMl, too. l'm from "Oh, my God," Nebraska. Omaha. Yeah. Well, l'm gross, so l will bid you a farewell, Mr. Lippe. Okay. See you at Horizon's tonight? Yeah, l don't... Well, maybe. A girl can dream. How are you doing? Good. Um... l really enjoyed your speech, President Helgesson. Oh. You were in there. Marvelous. l don't think we've met. Tim Lippe. Down from Brown Valley, Wisconsin, BrownStar lnsurance. Oh, boy. Tim, l don't know what to say. l'm just... We're all feeling it. l'm so sorry for the loss. Yeah, it's been really hard. Come here, son. Come here. Now, Tim, let me give you a few extra drink coupons for Horizon's. You go down there and fellowship and network with your colleagues. Huh? Thank you, President Helgesson. No, please. Orin. Hey, Bree isn't it? Yeah, the butterscotch dude right? Yeah. That's me, Captain Butterscotch. You guys want some? Yeah. Tim Lippe, BrownStar lnsurance. Glen Lindstrom. Lindy. Lindy Lindstrom. Excellent to meet you. What are you guys up to? Timbo! Right here, roomie. Party headquarters, right here. How's it going, Tim? Hi, Ronald. Dean? Come on. Call me Deanzie. What can l get you? Do you have root beer? You want a nipple on that? Ha-ha. No. The sooner you learn to ignore this degenerate, Tim, the better off you'll be. Degenerate! l love it! That's me! Okay, Big Time Tim, what exactly are you looking for, pussy-wise, in Cedar Crapids? Nothing, actually. What? Why are you showing me a picture of your mom? She's hot. No offense. She's not my mom. Okay? She's my girlfriend, and we're basically pre-engaged. Whoa, whoa. My bad. Beautiful woman, in any case. Wait a minute, what's "pre-engaged"? 'Cause if l was "pre-engaged," l will be pre-porking anything with a pulse. Where's your moral compass, Ziegler? You're married yourself. Was married, Ronald. Was. Oh, jeez, you and Patti split up? Oh, l'm sorry. She's an asshole. Ass-fucking-hole. Seventeen years of marriage, straight down the shitter. Lucky if one of them was decent. What was l talking about? Who wants to get wasted ! Choo-choo! JOAN: Hubba-hubba, check out those studs! Whoo! Joan Ostrowski-Fox. Oh, Ron Ronald, you look Rontastic. This one. Oh, l could just squeeze you to death, you little firecracker! ZlEGLER: How are you sweetheart? Oh, so good. Oh, Lippe. My lippies are sealed. You know this guy? Oh, that's right. From the fitness center. Yeah. l was really naughty with you down there. l'm really sorry, Tim. Oh, no. She's not. Oh, no. l'm not. (LAUGHS) Shots. Let's do it. What do you want guys? J?ger time. J?ger for me. Twist my arm. Drambuie. JOAN: Lippe? l'm a non-drinker. Oh, that's a bummer. Timbo, you gotta strap on a set of gords. JOAN: Yeah. All right? Come on, one won't kill you. Jeez, okay. lf you guys are gonna beat me up... Cream sherry. Cream sherry? You're insane. (LAUGHlNG) That's the craziest thing l've ever heard. This one's weird. ZlEGLER: Ready? Here we go. (COUNTlNG lN GERMAN) ln your hole! (WHOOPlNG) You be careful not to get too loaded there, Lippe. l might have to take advantage of you. Hey. Excuse me. Come on, l'm just razzing. Cut it out! You know what? lt's been a long day. Oh, come on, Timbo. Relax. Come on, l didn't mean anything by it. Good night. You can squeeze my ass, Joan. Ouch ! The government currently subsidizes $935 million worth of insurance policies... l'm in here! l'm in here... l know, l know. This needs to be private. Listen... Whoa! Something really didn't agree with you, huh? Yeah, l had... l think it was tainted yogurt. Listen, meet me in the stair... (EXHALES) Meet me in the stairwell in five minutes. All right? Pinch it off, it's important. Jesus Christ. (COUGHS) Psst! (SOFTLY) Timbo. We gotta talk. What? What is going on? After you left, l found out some serious shit. There is a petition going around trying to take away your company's Two Diamond Awards. What? They're saying Lemke's sexual peccadilloes were not godly, quote unquote. Somebody passed it to me, and l'm like, "Look, Lemke might have been a class-A deviant, "but what the fuck does that have to do with selling insurance?" Pardon my French, Dean, but you are completely full of bullroar. My boss, Bill Krogstad, told me that you called Joyce Armbruster and smeared Roger's name. No, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Timbo. That old whore called me. She's going on about how Lemke's a pervert and she wanted to take her business elsewhere. So l says, "All right, l'll crunch some numbers for you." Well, she calls me back later that same day saying how she got Krogstad to lower her premiums, which is exactly what the greasy twat wanted in the first place. So, you didn't call her? Tim. Look, l might be a lot of things, but a poacher ain't one of them. And l'm proud of that. You saw this petition? Yeah, l saw it. l didn't sign it. l said, "You guys are pussies." This is terrible. 'Cause the way that Roger died was an accident. Look, Lemke could have died cornholing a crippled kid for all l care. Not really, of course. My sister's got one. Down's. Sad. Point being, selling insurance is a business. lt's not a goddamn Boy Scout troop. So there's the scuttlebutt. Deal with it the way you want. (RONALD SNORlNG) (ZlEGLER SlGHS) And we thank you, Lord. We are grateful for the bounty you provide us this breakfast time. l am so hung over right now. The variety and the volume... Big time beer shits this morning. ... Lord Jesus, our truth. Amen. Amen. Say that again. l thought Pyle did a nice job, Ziegler. What's wrong with you, Timbo? You're like a gloomy Gus this morning. Come on, leave him alone. (CELL PHONE RlNGlNG) lf it's my ex-wife, l'm not here. l'm pretty sure it's not your ex-wife. lt's my boss. l have to take this. Tell The Kroger l said, "Hey." Hello. BlLL: Tim. l got a call from Orin Helgesson. He tells me he's worried about you. Tells me you're palling around with Dean Ziegler. Laughing at his jokes, buying him drinks. No, Bill. That's... What's the one thing? l said, "Steer clear of Dean Ziegler." Bill, that Dean Ziegler... No, it is Orin's sworn enemy. He told me that there is a petition going around to take away our Two Diamond Awards. What? All right, who the Christ signed that, huh? Who the Christ signed that? God damn it. God damn it. God damn it! Bill, l'll handle it. You can count on me. You just worry about your goddamn presentation tomorrow, Tim, and stop fucking around! l'll handle it. You take care of it, Lippe. l swear, l only smoke in Cedar Rapids. Jeez, what's wrong? l don't know, like, everything. So how did you get involved in the insurance game, Lippe? Oh, God. "lnsurance game." Look here, see, how did you get involved in the insurance game? You're freaky. Thank you. (BOTH LAUGH) lt's kind of a weird story, actually. l lost my dad in a sawmill accident when l was six years old. Oh, my God. Yeah. But the insurance agent fought like a tiger with the sawmill to make sure my mom and l were taken care of, and we were. And l remember thinking, when l was kid, l was just like, "This guy is a hero." l gotta say, l think insurance agents get a bum rap. You know? Like this river, the Cedar River, flooded a couple of years ago. A whole city. l know. l remember. lt was a massive disaster. Massive disaster, billions of dollars in damage, and who do you think was in the trenches trying to get people's lives back in order? lt was insurance agents. Not all of them, but a lot of them worked really hard to get people's lives back on track. Do you realize you just made it sound cool to be an insurance salesman? You are a hero, Lippe. (CHUCKLES) Shut up. Come on, we should get back. No, l can tell. You're the Superman type. Kind of dweeby on the outside but a real frigging stud underneath. Yeah, dweeby, okay. They call you lnsurance Man and put a big red "l" on your chest. Cool. Well, even if you are totally full of it, which you clearly are, it's still a nice thing to say, and l appreciate it. You're welcome. For crying out loud, Dean, you say the same thing every year! Because you think you're the Pope, Orin. And you're not the fucking Pope. And ASMl is not a church. There is a separation between religion and insurance. lt's in the constitution. Oh, good grief. You gotta admire Ziegler's style of debate. Volume, proximity and repetition. Yeah. (LAUGHlNG) l'm doing something right. Timbo! And O-Fox. Where have you two been? What is that? You got a pube on your cheek, Timbo. Oh, Jesus, Ziegler. Uncool. Eating the canned tuna from the bottom shelf. l love it! (LAUGHS) Guys, l gotta boogie. l'll see you later at the scavenger hunt. JOAN: Bye-bye. Aye aye, your holiness. Borin' Orin. Just joshing. Not. No, l'm really joshing. Not! Oh, got him twice. What's the scavenger hunt? JOAN: Oh ! You are about to find out, 'cause l just signed up you and O-Fox on the same team. Oh, yeah? Right on ! l shouldn't. Tim, l promise l won't molest you. Yet. (CHUCKLES) No, l'm kidding, l'm kidding. Come on, it'll be fun. Everyone's doing it. Okay, folks, the ASMl-Azing Race is just like The Amazing Race on TV... (COUGHS) No, it's not. ...except that instead of $1 million, the winning team gets a $45 gift card to the Kiku Japanese restaurant in the Westdale Mall. So, look for your first clue under the sea. And by that l mean in the pool area. (WOMAN WHOOPlNG) ZlEGLER: Don't get in the way. TIM: No brakes! No brakes. Coming through. Bricks? What the hell is this? ZlEGLER: lt's a word scramble, you dumb fucks. Raff...raff. Riff... Moff. Two letters. Two more letters. Mo... Moffarts. l know what it is. Fun Farm ! Yeah, be cool. Be cool. Golly, l really need to pee. l told you to go before we started, you idiot. Sorry. Queef. No Q. No Q, son of a bitch. (CHUCKLlNG EXClTEDLY) Hey, Bree. We're in first place! Good luck, butterscotch. JOAN: Okay, you're gonna make a right on Wilson. TIM: No, that doesn't make any sense. You're gonna... What? l'm gonna make a left on Wilson. Oops! North is north. South is south. lt's not complicated. Never Eat Shredded Wheat. Just remembered. l never heard that one before. Yeah, which is ironic because Shredded Wheat is delicious. Where are they? All right, Perry. Eyes on me. What are you doing here? You want me to throw you in? Balls deep, man. Go! Yeah ! Go! All right. What do l got to do? You have to find a red ball for your next clue. l'll give you 40 bucks for the clue straight out. Ziegler! Now! Go! All right, let's do it! Look out, Timbo, l'm going balls deep. (YELLlNG) (EXCLAlMS) l got it! Yes! Fill this thing. l'm gonna win. Fill it. Fill it. Fill it. Come on. Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! Go! Go! Eat the next one. Oh, my God. l'm gonna puke. No, you're doing great, and, by the way, you look really good with a wiener in your mouth. Did you just make a dick joke? No. Maybe. l love it! Okay, just go! Go! Go! Go! Look at him. He's like a little spider monkey. Ha-ha! Leaving them in the dust. You're almost there, bud. JOAN: Reach it! ZlEGLER: Timbo. You got a death wish pal? 'Cause you're about roughly 20 feet off the ground right now. Take a look. Uh-oh. Tim? Oh, God. Tim, are you okay? Give me a second. What do you... Tim, come on down. We got you, buddy! l'm gonna be fine! l think we better get him. ZlEGLER: Oh, my God. Oh, yeah. Why did you do it if you're gonna freak out? Tim, l got you, trust me. Just give me your hand, bro, lean back. l don't trust people with pony tails. Come on, man, give me your hand. Let's do this. l'm not extreme like you. (SCREAMlNG) Oh, Tim. Tim ! Oh, my God. Calm down. (CONTlNUES SCREAMlNG) Hold on. Hold on to this. JOAN: l got you, buddy. Guys, just lower him down. l got it. Come on down to me. Come on down. l got you, pal. Relax. Relax. JOAN: Okay. Okay. We got you. We got you. Come on, folks. l just saved a life here. (CROWD APPLAUDlNG) Just saved a life here. So since no one could complete the final task, and since Tim was higher than anyone else when all this brouhaha occurred, we're going to award the gift card to Tim and Joan. (EXCLAlMlNG) We won ! Nice. l love it. l love it. TIM: (SlNGlNG) We won We won the scavenger hunt We won We won Mmm. We won today. WAlTER: Well, congratulations. Thank you. And l found you a cream sherry. To dorks. Okay. Cheers. Cheers. lt's a compliment. Mmm. Oh, smooth. Tim Lippe, l am trying to figure you out. Oh, boy. l mean, hopes, dreams, aspirations. What do you got? Um... What l really would love someday, is to put a little greenhouse in my backyard. Okay, dream the impossible dream. Actually, it's far more reasonable than you think. Oh, please. l checked some out at Fleet Farm. Enough. They're portable. Stop it. And they won't break the bank. Wow, l'm talking, like, fantasy land. Okay? Like, what does Tim Lippe really want? Come on ! Okay, a family. Oh ! You know, l wanna be a dad. So, kids, l guess, is what l really want. You want mine? (LAUGHS) Um... Well... Not like, you know... What? l have kids. You have kids? Yeah, two. Tyler is 1 0. Ashley will be eight next month. My little squirrels. Oh, they are so cool. Aw, thanks. And, that's... My hubby, Rich Fox. Richie. We met when we were Rotary Exchange students in high school. Lived for a semester in Norway. You've been to Norway? Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Then we got married when we were sophomores in college, and then kids and... Wow. lf l had to do it all again, l don't know what l'd choose, but l don't have that option. So this is my fantasy land, Tim. You know, Cedar Rapids, ASMl. This. Sometimes a gal just needs a little vacation from who she really is, you know what l'm saying, Lippe? MAN: Yee-hah ! This is pathetic. Hey, Mike! l'm bored of the dance. You love me, Deanzie. There you two are. Check out Lloyd. He's going mental on the place. Oh, and you missed Mike Pyle doing his Riverdance, hillbilly bullshit again. (LAUGHS) Drinks on me. l like that. Timbo, have you tagged that yet? 'Cause she's gotta be as moist as a damp sponge. Ew, uh... No, she has a husband. What is wrong with you, Ziegler? Shit. What isn't wrong with me? l talk too much. l drink too much. l weigh too much. l piss people off. What's your situation, Ronald? Are you married or... Negative. l'm pretty well married to Ronald Wilkes lnsurance. Course l have my guilty pleasures, like antiquing. l'm active in community theater. And l have to admit, l'm a big enthusiast of the HBO program The Wire. But l haven't had a proper vacation in nine years. Yeah, you know, l never take my vacation, either. You know what you guys should do, is take a vacation together. We can go on one of them gay cruises with Rosie O'Donnell. You know what you are, Ziegler? You're what l call a real Richard. (RONALD LAUGHS) Mr. Richard Head. l don't get it. Dick Head, l get it. (LAUGHS) You're a total Richard. lt took me a second. All right, gents. Kamikazes. One, two, three. Down your hole! WOMAN: Okay, time for ASMI's next great taIent. Tim Lip is going to sing a number for us. Is there a Tim Lip? Did she just say my name? (LAUGHS) Oh, l'm sorry. She signed you up. Tim Lip? You can't do that. Ladies and gentlemen, l don't know if you know Tim Lippe here, it's "Lippe," by the way, he's down here, it's his first ASMl, he's up for a Two Diamond Award.

That's not true. lt is. He told me himself. Roger told me. Really? Why, he just told you that? That's the stupidest thing l've ever heard. Why would he tell you that? We were together. lt was stupid. lt ended two years ago, 'cause he was getting into some pretty weird stuff, as we all know now. No. Roger was a good man. He was a family man, and that was an accident. Roger was a freak. Not to mention a small minded, egotistical con artist. He was a liar, Tim. And, yes, he paid for the Two Diamonds. My foot! l'm sure you seduced him, just like you did me. You ruined my life. Are you fucking kidding me? l am trying to help you out and you are acting like a child.

Ow! (LAUGHS) Ow! Titty twister! Why are you laughing? You think my life is a joke? l lost my job and my lover and my hero paid bribes to win the Two Diamonds. What did you just say?

Timbo, this is pure gold. Please don't. All right, listen. We look like a couple of homos out here. Let's go in the room and discuss this like gentlemen, over Bloody Mary's. You're freaking out. Your world is crumbling. lt's your first ASMl. l get it. Here. Welcome to the jungle, Timbo. Now, my ex, Patti, well-established fact that this broad is a serious cunt stain, am l right? But she's got it to where the kids hate my guts. l'm the bad guy. Except, when our 1 7-year-old daughter comes home pregnant, who's the one who's so depressed she can't come out from under the afghan on the goddamn couch? Patti. And who's the one who's planning the baby shower and taking Meg to the gyno and all that shit? The fucking Deanzie. What are you talking about? What l'm talking about, Tim, is, even though l may be a blowhard and, let's face it, kind of a jagoff, l'm there for the people that need me. And l don't spill my friends' beans. Now, tell me this. Are we friends? Yeah. Did you feel that? Something just happened right now. Now, you're with Deanzie, and l'm not letting go. And believe me, l would love to expose Orin Helgesson's hypocritical bullshit. But if you're asking me not to, l won't, because you're my friend. Thank you. Now you see how dark this place is. All right, l got tiger scratches on my back from 20 years in this business. Let me tell you something. lf you wanna survive, you either gotta fight the tiger or you gotta dance with the tiger. Like Roger did. How do you make the tiger dance? You gotta show him a little teat. How'd it go with Helgesson, big guy? l think l did a fair to middling job. Oh, Tim, don't forget, your one-on-one with Orin starts in 1 0 minutes. President Helgesson. Come in. Have a seat on the davenport. President Helgesson, what l'd like to talk to you about today are risk mitigation mechanisms available to... You came down here to the big show, Tim, and you got the little twinklies in the eye, and you succumbed to the call of a floozy. l just want to say l'm really sorry for my role in the malfeasance in the pool. You blew it, Tim. You blew it. l need the Two Diamonds. Well, you should have thought of that before you took off your big boy pants. No, no. Please, just... All right, now you take a minute to compose yourself and then l'm gonna have to ask you to leave. l'm prepared to show you a little teat. Will you dance with me, President Helgesson? Do you wanna... We can dance. Tim... l have money. l can give you money. (CHUCKLES) lnteresting. You know, Tim, one thing that Roger knew. Roger knew that if you want to win, you... l like the way you put it, you have to be prepared to show a little teat. lt's a $50 traveler's check. lt's fully insured. Well, so it is. So it is. What else you got hiding in there? l brought $1 ,500 in checks in case of an emergency. Well, this sure seems like an emergency to me. Congratulations, Mr. Two Diamond Award winner.
