Fucking shit. What a fucking shit... What a shit... I need to talk to you... call me. Sweetheart... Are you there? Are you there? I've just spoken to your sister. She told me that you lost your cellphone, - and gave me this number. Listen, my dear... Look, there are those instantaneous soups- - that you don't need to cook. You just have to add boiling water, my dear... Hello, mom?! Mom, are you hearing me? Hello?... Hello? Good afternoon. I want to talk to Mrs. Dantas, please. Yes... Officer Juan Alberto Martinez. Chief of the Naval Staff. Madam... ...I want to communicate that the autopsy is ready. - Hello? - Yes... Now you have to call a funeral home to collect the body. They will help you with the formalities. Funeral home? Yes, the funeral service. Are you feeling well, madam? Yes, yes, yes. DON'T FORGET THE PLANTS Who is it? Yes madam, it is Ruben, the concierge. I got a package for you. - Ah... where is it? - Here. Here. This is yours, right? - Yes, yes, sure. - No, let me do it. - Here... here is okay... - Is it okay here? Yes, yes... sure. Thank you. You're welcome! Anything you need... You call me, okay? You know I'm downstairs. You call me. You pick up the phone, I answer. Thank you very much, bye. Goodbye, see you soon! Funeral home, good morning. Good morning... I need a transport service for a body. No problem. Where to? To Brazil... Ah, you want to take a body abroad! Yes... And the deceased resided here, - or was in the country as a tourist? We were on holidays... on vacation. Ah! So, we are talking about a repatriation! Let's see... I need you to bring the death certificate, - the deceased's ID, the deceased's ID, - proof of the applicant's family ties with the deceased, - cemetery's authorization where the body is going to be buried, - information of the person and the funeral home that- - will receive the body in Brazil... Hi, it's me. You sent me the list with all documents, - but you didn't send me the address... Send it quickly so that I can get a courier- - and send everything at once. Hello? Listen baby, how can you possibly- - tell me that the tequila was shit? That tequila was... Tequila, tequila, tequila! You get it? That tequila had everything, even worms! You got a cigarette? I'm sorry? You have a cigarette? A cigarette! What? What I want to tell you, is that the tequila... ...was a jewel. Homemade, first rate, top-notch. No, no, wrong number. WHERE DID YOUR VOICE GO? IN WHICH PLACE WOULD YOUR SILENCE BE? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BAD MOOD? WHAT ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU LEARNED? AND YOUR STORIES, DO THEY STILL EXIST? WHERE DID YOUR DREAMS GO? WHERE DID YOUR CALM REMAIN? AND YOUR FEARS? WHAT ABOUT YOUR PASSION? WHERE CAN I FIND YOUR LOVE? Ops, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought there was nobody home... ...I'm the downstairs neighbor.. ...I came to water the plants but... Are you watering them? Ah, yes... no, yes, of course... Are you Brazilian? I can't believe it... I was just there! I spent... something like the worst vacation of my life. You know, when you travel with your boyfriend- - to figure out whether to get married or break up? Well.. ...It's so hot... Well... Well, if you need help, let me know. I can come and help you to water the plants... ...I came back earlier, so I have plenty of time, okay? And you already know: I've got they keys! Bye. Yes ma'am, your documents arrived from Brazil. What I'm not seeing... is the death certificate. I don't know! I don't have it... What do you mean, "I don't know?". Where is the body? The body... Junin Street 762. Ah! But this is the judicial morgue! In this case, there is a little problem... Whenever there is a police intervention, one cannot- - take a body out of the country without the judge's permission. What? Yes, ma'am, the body cannot leave the country- - until the judge gives the permission. So? You have to choose between burying it in the Federal Capital- - or putting it temporarily in a niche. Until the judge gives the permission. A niche...? What is a niche? Yes, it's the... the... The shelf where coffins go in the cemetery... And how long could it take? Well... these procedures are slow... ...It can take a long time until the judge gives the permission. But I cannot stay! Well, you can leave us a power of attorney- - and we send you the body once the judge- - has released it. In that case you should leave everything paid- - before your departure, of course. Let me think. I'm leaving... ...I'll give you the power of attorney and leave. Very well, you can pass by tomorrow and sign it. We have a model ready. Charcas 3251. OK... I'm leaving. I'm leaving... I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving! Funeral home, good afternoon. I'm staying. Very good ma'am, - it's 15,000 pesos for the transport, - plus 20,000 pesos of thanatopraxy, - everything plus taxes, of course. Once you bring me the money, - we schedule a time to get the body. I'm not leaving without my husband. Origami is art from small to big. It helps the head, the intelligence. Don't miss our next program, - in which we will teach how to make own ikebana. Thank you! I don't like the idea of you being- - there on your own. I'd like to come over, and be there with you. No, no, don't worry! There's a family that we met on the trip... I don't know, Don't worry. Really. I would feel much better being there with you. Look, I think... I need to get some rest, let's talk later. OK, as you like... Kiss. Kiss. Abracadabra. WHERE ...WHERE DID YOUR VOICE GO? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BAD MOOD? WHERE DID YOUR CALM REMAIN? AND YOUR FEARS? WHAT ABOUT YOUR PASSION? WHERE CAN I FIND YOUR LOVE? IN YOU. YOUR INHABITANT Did you like it, my love? Did you, honey? So, let's go? Enough! Enough! Let's go! No, ma'am... I told you in some days. It should still be at the Public Prosecutor. Anyway, I'm telling you that only when it arrives- - the classification begins. What is the classification? To determine if it was a crime or an accident. It was an accident. Well, that is not for you to decide. Did you leave your contact? Yes. So, remain calm that you will be notified. My love, look what I've found... A lot of water is dripping down... ...and I have my clothesline on the balcony, - right under yours... my clothes are getting all wet. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm gonna be more careful. It's fine. It's not that serious anyway. Well, see you soon. Did you like it, my love? Did you, honey? So, let's go? Enough! Enough! Let's go! Are you going to pay me or not? Because if you pay me it's one thing... The sex on the beach is for the brunette, idiot! And if you don't pay me it's another... Do you understand? I'll get you the mandarin liquor, just wait a second. That's it, let's see if we can get this over with... Think that everything has a meaning. The universe is wise, we're the ones who don't see it. But everything is perfect... ...always. From now on, you're gonna live with him in another way. You're gonna feel him inside you... Well, what can you do? Any news? Did anyone call me? Ah, yes, a guy called two times already. He said something about a party, - and keeps talking about tequila... What? I can't believe, what a cheeky bastard! What's the matter with him? Did he go mad? Tell that scumbag, that the agreed price- - was for a luxury bar! That with that shitty tequila he served, - he almost got all the guests sick! What's the matter with him? Tell him that I'm going to accuse him of attempted murder. And then he can make cocktails for the prisoners! Get it? Are you there? You there? Yes. Listen, are your watering my plants? Who is it? Oops, it's me... I'm sorry, I thought you weren't here anymore. No, no... I'm here. Well... Bye. WHERE DO THE DEAD GO? WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SOUL... DOES REALITY EXIST? Step 1. Place recipient on work desk. Step 2. Put floral foam in recipient. Step 3. Put sky in recipient. Put angle... Make it slightly inclinate. You know, I grew up with my grandmother. She loved plants, and I must have inherited that love from her. I love to come here... To be alone, watching, watering. Sometimes I even dance for them... Oh, I am sorry, I got you wet! Sorry, sorry... No, ma'am... calling is not going to speed things up, okay? As I told you, we will call you. Hello? Mom... My love, I was lying awake here. I started going through some photo albums. I was looking at one from the summer- - when you saw the ocean for the first time. Remember? You were running around the beach like crazy- - shouting: "Thank you mom for bringing me here, - today is the happiest day of my life!” And you were only three or four years old... I was like three or four, right? I remember that we moved to Rio that summer, right? Wasn't that the summer I used- - to wear that blue bikini with the big top? Yeah... that I insisted for you to take it off, but there was no way. I wanted to feel like a grown-up wearing a bikini. Yes... The one that Santa Claus brought for you that Christmas... No, mom... Wasn't that the year he brought me a tricycle? No... I don't think so... Wasn't the tricycle the following year? Oh, yes! I remember I used to fill the house's veranda with flowers, - and walk hand in hand with the tricycle- - as if entering a church... I married the tricycle everyday! Do you remember? I remember! What was it's name? It was... It was Pipo, mom! It was Pipo! It was Pipo the tricycle, remember? Wasn't Pipo the frog you adopted- - one summer in the countryside? I remember neither your father- - nor I could get you to leave that frog alone, - and come to eat with us! You swore eternal love to that frog! - Guess what? - No... what? The woman was hospitalized, hos-pi-ta-li-zed, you get it? The dude kept saying “hospital, hospital.” OK, I got it, hospitalized. But what was it? Something serious? It doesn't matter, it really doesn't matter what she had, - the point is that she was hospitalized. The guy had gone to fetch some clothes to take to the hospital, - and happened to answered the phone, - and told me everything. But, what did she have? It doesn't matter what she had. Probably something serious, - some kind of it is: Hepatitis, Pancreatitis, Colitis... ...I don't know. But now comes the best part... She had an operation... the operation went well- - and the gals here recover! They turn beautiful! At the same exact moment when they were operating her, they turned beautiful! When she got back, they were ravishing. Much better than when she left. This one, for instance, was tiny and rickety, - it hit a growth spurt you can't imagine! So beautiful! Look at it now! That's how they are: Needy. I think we've done enough for the day, and with this heat... Bye. Why do you make me come here, to your house, - to have to knock at your door, and tell you what I need to say? You didn't like the tequila? Well... here I have a tequila you will like, - and you will taste it, - and you will see that it is the best tequila... ...in the whole world. I'm gonna give you terrible tequila! Hello, yes, I'm sorry. I just got another phone call. Well, I wanted to let you know that your file arrived. Really? Yes, it arrived today from the district attorney's office. How wonderful! And when do you think it will be ready? No ma'am, as I said, one thing has nothing to do with the other. The file arrived, but when it is going to be classified, I don't know. The judge has lots of files piled up on his desk- - before yours, ma'am. What do you mean, he has plenty of files piled up? Wasn't it that when the file arrived- - the judge would analyze it? Look ma'am, I don't know how it works in your country. Here it is summer, we just got out of the judicial recess, - and the files get piled up. What? They told me that when the file arrived, - the paperwork would start... How is it that now there is a list of people ahead of me? Ma'am, I understand you, but please don't yell at me. This case is not a priority. There is nothing I can do. Oh no, you don't understand me, I am not yelling at you, - I am screaming at the wall! They told me when the file arrived, they would start the paperwork! Begin and start. Arrive and start. Arrive and start. What do you people think? That I have all the time in the world? I have a life, I have to get back to my life! I can't stay here. And what now? What are you going to tell me? Why isn't it a priority? Can you tell me why it isn't a priority? I want to know why it isn't a priority! Sorry ma'am, the thing is that when it comes to a deceased, they don't give priority. My mom is very old, - she's very lucid, but she doesn't move anymore. What do you mean, she doesn't move? Of course she moves! Your mom may no longer take the city bus, - or do a triple somersault, but of course she moves... No, you didn't understand me, she is bedridden. Of course I understood you, the one who didn't understand was you. We all move, everyone in our own way, - at our own pace, but we all move. Like the clouds or like that snail there, did you see it? Like this tree... it moves! It moves. That banana tree came from the coast of the Parana river. Can you imagine how the poor thing must feel? It was so happy on the riverbank, in paradise, - and suddenly ends up here, in an eighth floor! Hello... And we were both lying on the grass with our eyes shut. We didn't do or say anything. Our bodies almost touched. And I wondered what you were thinking. And I imagined that I started touching you. I went under your clothes, under your skirt, your shirt... While I advanced with my hands you continued- - not doing or saying anything. You just let it happen... So hot! They say it's the hottest summer in the last 40 years... Thank you. So... ...I put the finger on my head, it hurts... ...I put the finger on my neck, it hurts... ...I put the finger on my belly... The neck... Yes, yes... it hurts. So, the doctor says to Manuel: I'm sorry, Manuel- - but you've got a broken finger! It's so stupid. A Manuel, another Manuel... Always Manuel! Manuel, a rich old man, is married to Maria, - a beautiful young girl. So Joaquin, his friend, asks him... Listen! Listen! Tell me Manuel, Maria has sex with you for love or interest? So Manuel starts to think and then replies: Look Joaquin, it must be for love, because she doesn't show any interest! - Do you want some? - Yes. Thank you. - So hot! - Yes. No, no. Are you okay? Are you okay? Tell me, what's happening? Are you there? Are you there? I know something is wrong with you. You think I don't notice? You can trust me... ...open up please, and tell me what's wrong. Yes, Mrs. Dantas... this is the court assistant. I need to talk to you, urgently. Call me as soon as you get this message, please. Thank you. So, it indeed got classified as an accident, - I spoke to the judge about you, and we got the release immediately. How about that? Hello? Hello? Yes, yes... Thank you very much. You're welcome... I'm happy to help. I'll wait for you here then. Thank you! Funeral home, good morning. Mrs. Dantas here. My husband's body has been released. Ah! That's great! Congratulations! I was just talking here to a colleague about your case... ...I thought you would stay here through the winter! Ma'am... What should I do now? How much does your husband weigh? Pardon me? It's in order to reserve the hold. If the weight exceeds 140 kg, including the boxes, - it is a different plane and another price. Eighty. OK, perfect. Then it's the price I gave you. Let me see... Here... here... I see a flight... Ah, look! You are lucky! You are lucky! You should get the judicial order, and bring it along with- - the death certificate and the amount I told you, in dollars. Once I get the money, I pay the airline, - and give you the flight information. You can continue your way to the airport, - and buy your ticket on the same flight. We collect the coffin from the niche, wrap it up with corrugated cardboard, - and send it to be packed in a rectangular wooden box... ...so that it no longer has the shape of a coffin... People don't like it. Ma'am? Ma'am? Are you there? Yes, yes, yes... I'm here. I'm going there. Hello? And get ready to meet your maker, because you know- - what I am gonna do? I'm gonna grab a tank, - I'll fill it with tequila and- - I will throw you inside so that you drink... DON'T FORGET THE PLANTS! It's coming... You are on time, right? Yes, yes, I am fine. That's good. Can I open the trunk, boss? It's OK ma'am, let me, let me... Thank you. You're welcome! Ready. Ready to go. Well, it was a pleasure, ma'am. Good luck. Thank you... Thank you.
