[woman] Fears of another wave intensify as the worldwide death toll rises. [man] As Los Angeles enters its 213th week of lockdown, the Health Department... [male reporter speaking Spanish] [female reporter 1] ...the Health Department has raised... [male reporter 2] Experts are reporting COVID-23 has mutated. [male reporter 3 speaking foreign language] [female reporter 2] Today, Los Angeles opened its first quarantine zone. The Q-zone was created to house the sick and the dying... [male reporter 4 speaking foreign language] [female reporter 1] Anyone with a fever will be taken to the Q... [reporters speaking foreign languages] [woman] The mortality rate has risen to 56%. [man] Only the few people immune to the virus are able to leave their homes. [overlapping newscasts in foreign languages continue] [female reporter 2] Today, the CDC unveiled designs for America's new immunity passes. These passes come in the form of canary yellow... [birds twittering] [dog barking, howling in distance] [panting] [helicopter whirring] - [beeps] - [line ringing] [male voice] What? Yeah, I got a delivery here. You're late, asshole. Just put it in the box. [automated female voice] UV sanitation activated. [machine chimes] UV sanitation complete. [machine beeps] - All good? - [male voice] No tip. And tell Lester I want a new delivery guy next time. You just hate me 'cause I'm immune and you're not. What did you say? I said, "Don't forget to toast the apocalypse." [helicopter whirring] [female voice] Curfew is now in effect. All unauthorized citizens must stay indoors. Remember the good old days of fake news? Real news is worse. Because any day, the antibody test is coming. Antibody test? I signed up for that #### shit three years ago. In a Burger King drive-through. Guess what? Burger King's gone. What'd they tell us for the last three #### years? Stay home and wash your hands. [male reporter 5] New data confirms the virus attacks the brain tissue. I've been hearing a lot of weird rumors about the institutional corruption at the Department of Sanitation. [female voice] ...will be arriving in four to six hours. You must not attempt to leave your home. Check out the new immunity bracelet. Literally, can't leave the house without this. I wonder if that's how dinosaurs went. Just like... [female reporter 3] The global death count is now over 110 million. It's the end of the world, bro. - [man] As Los Angeles enters its 213th... - It feels like the apocalypse. So, we just got to sit home, like gerbils, in our little bullshit cages. [man on PA] Noncompliance will be met with severe penalty. - Guess what. - [man on PA] Lockdown is in full effect. There ain't no good news coming. [woman on PA] ...or you will be shot on sight. [male courier] Hey, Lester. I'm held up, man. They're checking bags, they're checking tags. Sanitation is on one today. [Lester] Stop messing around, guys. Rich people need their shit! [male courier 2] Lester, nobody's here for the pick-up. I've been waiting about 15 minutes. Okay, turn that around as soon as you can. Jonie, you're ten minutes late getting to me. Come here. Hey, man, don't get bitchy with me. Anthony, it's a left on Fountain. Left! [Anthony] Man, I'm turning left. Put your left hand out, check mark with the right. - Jeez, I gotta teach you your ABC's too? - I'm going right. Sorry. [man on radio] We're having a little delay. We're seeing a new checkpoint right there on Hollywood and Highland. Kyle Kuzma, he advances. He gets it to LeBron. Lebron dunks for the win! Yes, the crowd goes wild! [imitates crowd cheering] [phone ringing] You made that priority drop yet? It's next on my list. Priority means it's first on your list. Lester, it's all the way across town. Hold up. Are you at the court? Uh... No. I have GPS. Then maybe. Make a three for Kobe and get going. Hi, guys. What's up? This is Larray. My best friend didn't pass his thermal scan and the Department of Sanitation took him to the Q-zone. So, I'm worried, 'cause once you go to the Q-zone, you don't ever leave. Good morning, Marie. Good morning, señora. I cut some fruit for you in the kitchen. Thank you. Good morning. God, kid. - I have a question for you. - Yes? So, I was wondering about the whole Ellie thing. Yeah, what about it? So, her mom says that it's fine if she comes and hangs out for a little while. I'm sorry. You know we can't have people over. - All we're... - Not to mention, it is illegal. What are you gonna do? Call Sanitation on two 12-year-olds? Have them take us to the zone? You keep pushing it, and you might just find out. Did you take your vitamins? - Yes, Mom. - Do you have your inhaler? - Uh-huh. - Okay, you're up. [automated female voice] Virus check in progress. Three, two, one. No virus detected. - Straight A's. - Have a great day. So please go tell your dad it's time to take the temp test. Dad! Mom said it's time for your temp test! I could have done that. [female reporter 4] ...by order of the mayor, who stated martial law shall remain in place for the foreseeable future. Today, the Department of Sanitation announced the opening of a new Q-zone in Boyle Heights. The facility would be the fifth of its kind established in the city despite recent controversy over a leaked report describing conditions in these zones as barbaric. [automated female voice] Virus check must be completed. You have five minutes to... Virus check in progress. Three, two, one. No virus detected. Have a great day. It's Nico, from Lester's Gets. Missus, the delivery boy is here. Great, these are ready to go. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. [automated female voice] UV sanitation activated. [Nico] Ready? [Emma chuckles] Do you think we're just fish in a bowl to him? [chuckles] [machine beeps] [automated female voice] UV sanitation activated. UV sanitation complete. Okay. Thank you. Really, thank you. [both laugh] Go this way. Yo, yo, yo! Checking in per usual. New strain, new year. Isn't that great? Looks like this one'll kill you quick. They're saying people who are catching this are dropping dead within 48 hours. Yesterday I saw a 10-year-old girl getting dragged from her house and taken to the Q-zone. Well, we know what the "Q" stands for. "Quick death." All I'm saying is, if you see those guys in those big-ass yellow suits coming up your block, you better hide your little sister. [phone chimes] [chuckles] Good evening, Miss Garcia. Still on for date night? Oh, every night. You can't get rid of me. You're such a stalker. Yeah, well, it's easy when my victim can't leave her home. You're not missing much out here. Yeah, except for that view. Oh, you like that? This is my view, though. I think mine's better. Say hi, Lita. Hola, Nico. ¿Cómo estás? Hey, Lita. How are you? Muy bien, Lita, ¿y tú? - Estoy bien, ¿y tú? - [young woman laughs] - Nico, please don't fall. - I'm not gonna fall. If I did, I wonder how long it would take someone to find me out here. Are you kidding? Lester would have a cleanup crew there in, like, ten minutes, tops. [in deep voice] Because a dead courier is bad for business. I sounded just like him, didn't I? I'll see you later, stupid. I miss you. Give me an hour. I got one more drop-off I'm late for. I'm not going anywhere. [phone chimes] [phone rings] [Lester] Dozer, I need eyes on one of my couriers. High and tight. High and tight. [beeping] Hello. Yeah, Piper, it's Steve, Gwen's husband. You did that save the rhino thing for us a few years back. Oh, yeah. That was a great party. What can I do for you? We, um... We wanna take a trip beyond the city limits. Heard you might have the hookup. Something to help us get past the checkpoints. Party will cost you 300 grand. Done. Okay, great. Well, we'll be in touch. [pings, buzzes] [sizzling] [female newscaster] Three apartment buildings in Van Nuys were condemned today after a number of residents failed their daily virus check. A spokesperson from the Department of Sanitation issued a response to the outbreak warning that the department was currently completely overwhelmed by the caseload and reminding citizens that COVID is airborne. No one should leave their home for any reason. [man on radio, indistinct] [male courier 3] ...closed down in Echo Park. [Dozer] I have eyes on the target. Repeat, I have eyes on the target. What? [chuckles] [helicopter whirring overhead] [indistinct radio chatter] - Stop! Show us your hands. - Hey, whoa, whoa! I'm immune! Get on the ground! Now! I'm immune! [checkpoint guard] He's got a bracelet. Guy's immune. Have him walk on. Wow. You gotta be kidding me. You guys really need to work on your people skills. - No loitering. - I'm sorry. Am I holding up the line? Keep it moving, you munie scum. Yeah, keep your mask on. Don't take that mask off. [over earphones] It's your boy Adam W. Hey, check it out. So today, I want to shout out all of our immune workers. You mythical creatures, you legends. So, these munies live alone. Total isolation. Talk about social distancing. And the whole time they're out there, they're getting coated in COVID. It's in their hair, their clothes. And as one guy put it to me, that shit sticks. They can't go near friends or family, 'cause they might get them sick. Remember that the next time your pining for one of those yellow bracelets. Good as new. [engine starts, revs] Whoo-hoo-hoo! Thank you, Mrs. Griffin. [Nico] Spoke to my buddy in Big Sur again. He says they haven't had a case in six months. [young woman] If only we could get out of the city. [Nico] I'm still putting feelers out to get black-market passes. No hits yet, but once we have those, I quarantine for three weeks and then we're gone. [young woman] Hey, at least you got your ride back. [Nico] More deliveries a day means more money to save. Who would have thought Lester's Gets is actually good at getting things? The man doesn't disappoint. Tomorrow, Nico and Cielito will ride again. I still can't believe you named that sick-ass bike Cielito. I know, it's great, right? No. There she is. [young woman] Your one true love. [chuckles] [Nico] Here, check this out. Hey, your garden's not dead. Give it time. God, I swear all I do is love and nurture these things and all they do is die on me. We should take 'em with us when we leave. Lita has green fingers. We're getting Lita her own place, by the way. - Are we? - Yeah. I figure we have a lot of lost time to make up for, and we're not gonna want a chaperone, are we? I'm telling her you said that. - Do not tell her I said that. - I am. You know I'm terrified of her. That's why I'm telling her. [sirens wailing in distance] [bell dings] Bingo. Hey, guys. It's me, May. This is May Sings the Blues. I'm a struggling singer-songwriter who still remembers the good old days when we could still listen to music all together. So, you can make any requests and you can hit like if you like what you hear and maybe even subscribe. So, what's next? Let's lighten the mood a little bit. [May chuckles] Vanilla Ice? No, that's the wrong stream, buddy. MD0239 says, "I remember you played a great cover of 'American Pie' once. Your songs got me through some rough days when I was in the military."

[automated female voice] UV sanitation complete. - Oh. - Package is successfully prepped. [chuckles] "Roses are red, violets are blue... but I can't get those in this screwed-up world, so here's some pencils for you." You stole them, Nicholas James. How did I steal 'em? There's nobody around. They're just sitting there, but if you don't want 'em... No, no. Give me, give me, please. All right, I'm putting 'em in. [automated female voice] UV sanitation complete. Oh, my God. I could kiss you right now. Yeah, well, someday. The way I figure, by the time I'm 87 and you're, what is it, 84, we should have enough put away... - Shut up. - ...to buy passes and get out of the city. I'm serious. It's a dream. - [phone chimes] - Oh, shit, Lester's calling me. I'm gonna add him in. [R&B playing on stereo] [Nico] What's up, boss? What the hell are you doing? Don't you have somewhere to be? Like a high-priority drop on the west side? I'm on it. Say hi to Sara. Hey, Lester. Stop distracting my best courier. Whoa, wait. Did you just say, "best courier"? Slip of the tongue. Now get going. Well, you heard the man. - I gotta get going. - Yep. I'll call you tonight? I don't know. I think I have to check my busy schedule, but I think I can make it work. [automated female voice] User MD donated $100. [chuckles] Well, buckle up. Yeah, I'm gonna call you. [video call dialing] [ringing] Hey, MD? Uh, D-Dozer. Like a bulldozer? Uh, like Michael Dozer. Hey, Michael. I'm May. It's nice to meet you. No, I know you're May. You miss it, Dozer, the way things were? I was on lockdown long before it was fashionable. How come? When I got back from the war, people didn't want to talk about it. You're a vet in a wheelchair, people are... They see you, they put their face in their phones. They don't want to have to face that. Somewhere down the line, I just... stopped going out. For how long? It's, uh... It's coming up on six years. [May] Wow. You're a pro at lockdowns. This must be a cakewalk for you. I don't know about a cakewalk, for anybody, but... having Max... I mean, Max here is my eyes and ears. [May] Hey, Max. Is it as bad as it seems out there? It's worse. It's way worse. But it pays the bills. [man in film] Three thousand dollars. It might as well have been three million. [woman] What's the matter with you tonight? You look like you lost your last friend. How'd you like to go to... I feel like I'm at the theater. Yeah, you kinda have to squint a little, but, I mean, it's basically like Mann's Chinese out here. Mmm. That was my favorite one. You know I used to go there every Friday for matinees, right? Do you think that maybe we were there for the same showings? I did remember seeing this really hot girl that I was too scared to talk to. You're full of shit. Where did you get the projector? Another score from the old office. You really emptied that place out, huh? Oh, there's nothing left. Everything's here. I could make a law firm out of my house right now. I have paper, paper clips, binders, highlighters, a hole punch. - I have a fax machine. - A fax machine? Yeah, my mom would be proud. She always said I'd end up running the joint. Can you see that? [woman in film] There'll be thousands of dollars there. Actually, now that you mention it, would you mind telling the guy in front if he could please remove his hat? This guy right here? Is that better? Hey, Lita, you wanna watch with us? [in Spanish] [coughing] Go back to your room and I'll bring you medicine, okay? [coughing] Is she sick? [sirens wailing] [automated female voice] Stay in your homes. We are here to help. - [indistinct radio chatter] - Please remain in your homes. Your safety is our priority. If you attempt to leave your home, you will be shot on sight. Please remain in your homes. - What are you doing here? - Who's asking? [automated female voice] Lockdown is still in effect. I am Emmett D. Harland, Department of Sanitation. [intercom buzzes] [buzzing continues] [indistinct radio chatter] Sara, what's going on? I got out of Q-zone today. I'm clean. What are you doing? Just bring it in. Get away from me! [grunts] DOS is on-site. Standing down. Heading to next callout. Over. [sighs, chuckles] [loud knocking] [sanitation man] Department of Sanitation, open up! Shh. Eh, break it in, guys. [Harland] Hey, guys, guys, guys! It's the wrong apartment. I said 3-2, 32. Can you read? Department of Sanitation. They're coming for Alice. Just break it down. - [loud bang] - Mrs. Grant. Alice and William Grant? This is the Department of Sanitation. By the power granted to me by the City of Los Angeles, I hereby detain you under the ordinance 312 for immediate transport to the Q-zone. [loud bang] - [pounding] - Sara, it's me! [whimpers] Sara, do not open that door. [pounding continues] Do not open that door. I'm coming over right now. Please! Please help me! Nico, please hurry. [Alice] Stop! No! Please! Somebody help me, please! Somebody help me! Get off me! [Alice's whimpering fades] [intercom buzzing] I know you're in there. Hello. Are you Ms. Garcia? I'm terribly sorry to inform you that there's been an outbreak of cases in this building, including your poor neighbor. Have you ever left your apartment? Maybe a glass of wine with Mrs. Grant? Like, a little gossip? A little talk? Breaking the lockdown? No, we follow the rules here. You wouldn't believe how many times I've gotten that answer. And before you know it, I'm back at the same address. That's... [laughs] Yeah, you know, it's... Disobedience is, like, spreading like a tornado. Well, don't forget your TempCheck in the morning. And remember, stay safe, sane and sanitized. [clicks tongue] [breathing heavily] [Sara's grandmother coughing] No! No, you have to stay away from me. [in Spanish] Please, just let me help you, okay? For all we know, it's just a cold, Lita. [in Spanish] [coughing] No, Sara, stay away from me. [coughing] [phone rings] Hey, I just got here. How is she? She's not good. She has a fever. Oh, shit. Temp test is at 9:00 a.m., Nico. Okay. They'll take us both. You know that, right? They'll take both her and me. Sara... Hey, hey. No one's taking you from me. [coughing continues] She needs me. You should go, okay? It's not safe here. Yeah, right. I'm not going anywhere. Thank you. - [Piper] Breaking curfew? - Oh, Jesus. Harland needs to see me. - Oh, does he? - [William] Yeah. Mm. He has those passes that we need. Mm. So may I leave? You know, every time you open that door, you risk letting in what's out there. Yeah, I know. I also know that it is the only way that we are keeping a roof over our heads. Those are your words. Not mine... Jesus. Piper, you think I want to go out there? I think you love it. And just because you wear that bracelet, doesn't make it true. So be a good boy and burn that sleek little outfit of yours before you come back into the house. [gas hisses] [door shuts] [whispers] Nico? Nico? I'm here. She's sleeping. She needs to rest. It's like I can feel you through this door. [chuckles] Hey... Do you remember when we first met, and you were yelling at me in Spanish? [chuckles] I have no recollection of that. [Nico] I blame Lester's handwriting. It said 31, but I read it as 37, and I came pounding on your door like a jackass. Do you ever wonder what would've happened if you knocked on some other girl's door? Well, I knock on a hundred doors a day. But I've never met anyone like you. I'm really glad Lester messed up that address. Yeah, me too. Oh, hey, Mom. What are you still doing awake? I heard voices. Did Dad leave? Yeah, he had to go out, but he'll be back. He shouldn't do that. It's not safe. I know. But sometimes we have to do things we don't want to survive. Mom... Do you ever wish I was different? What? No, sweetie. What do you mean? Ellie said with you being immune, there's a 50% chance I would be. - [Piper] Oh, honey. - And I'm not. Instead, I'm even weaker than a normal person. You are not weak. But if I wasn't like this, you could go places. You wouldn't have to worry about me. And why would I wanna go anywhere if you couldn't be with me? Listen to me. You are perfect. Absolutely perfect. And I wouldn't change one thing about you. And neither would your father.

Okay. - I'll go first, okay? - Mm. [automated female voice] Virus check in progress. [beeping] Four, three, two, one. No virus detected. Have a great day. [in Spanish] [automated female voice] Virus check in progress. Four, three, two, one. Virus check has failed. A fever has been detected at your residence. - Armed guards will be arriving shortly. - [crying] You must not attempt to leave your home or you will be apprehended. Do not attempt to engage with armed guards. - [Sara speaking Spanish] - Bribes will not be accepted. - Your well-being is our biggest priority. - [Sara] It's gonna be okay.

I have to let you go, Nico. Please say goodbye to me. I'm not saying that, Sara. I'm not saying that! - Please say goodbye to me. - [Nico] I'm not saying that! I'm gonna get the immunity passes today. How? I'll figure it out. I'm coming back, okay? - I'm coming back for you. - Okay. [sobbing] [ringtone: Lester's voice] Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Lester, I need two immunity passes now. [laughing] What? You think if I had a stash of immunity cuffs hanging around, I'd still be living in this shithole? Lester, please. They're coming for Sara. - I have to get her out. - [helicopter whirring] This is what happens when you fall in love with a have-not. I can't help you. [automated female voice] This building is under full quarantine. Look, all I need is a lead. Just give me something. [sighs] Them packages you've been running on the side for the Griffins... Are you shitting me? I've been running black-market cuffs and you didn't tell me? Nico, listen, you didn't hear this shit from me. That asshole is my biggest client - but he's also a man you do not want to mess with. - [sanitation man] Get lost. Bracelets are 150 G's a piece. - You better have the money to back it up. - I'll figure it out. [automated voice] Lockdown is mandatory. Noncompliance will be met with severe... Damn, kid. [tires squeal] [intercom chimes] Señor Nico. How was Harland? Nuts. - Mm. - Uh, passes for Steve and Gwen are ready. Are you sure we can trust them? Everyone in my network is reliable. That's not who I'm worried about. What's that supposed to mean? - [knocking] - A courier is here. Says he needs to speak with you, Mr. Griffin. [William] Courier? Thank you, Marie. Yeah, Nico? Mr. Griffin? Yeah, what do you want? I would never normally do this, but it's an emergency. I need two of these. I heard maybe you can help me. Mr. Griffin? I don't know what to tell you, kid. I... I can't get those any more than anybody else can. Look, Mr. Griffin, I have 13 grand. I know that's nowhere near enough, but it's all I... How does he know about us? I don't know. Who've you been shooting your mouth off to? I haven't been shooting my mouth off to anyone. Why don't you ask your network, 'cause it's so "reliable"? - Need I remind you what happens to us... - No. ...if people find out what we're doing? - We go to jail, or even worse... - You do not. I know. - ...we get thrown into the Q-zone. - Really? And then what happens to Emma? Piper, I told the kid to go away. What else do you want me to do? I'd like to know how he knows about us. Well, why don't you do it? Why don't you find out? I'm so sick of cleaning up your shit. - Uh, Nico? - Mrs. Griffin? I think my husband is just being extra cautious, but I think I can help you. Thank you, Mrs. Griffin. Hey, listen, um, who told you about us? Nobody. Nobody told me. I had nowhere to go, so I came here. I figured you guys had connections. [Piper] Listen, we don't have what you're looking for, but, um, I know someone who does. Marie. Can I give you what I have? It's not much. I don't need your money. [automated female voice] UV sanitation activated. Mrs. Griffin, you have no idea how much this means. Thank you, and you're saving a life. [sanitation man] It's not done yet. [Nico] I have a lead. I'm on my way there now. How's Lita? She's not good. There's armed guards outside my door. [automated female voice] Do not attempt to leave your home. [Nico] I'll call you when I have the passes. Just be ready, okay? Okay. Sara. [in Spanish] [sobbing chuckle] [Sara in Spanish] [machinery whirring] [man singing opera in distance] Hello? Hello? [man] ♪ Maria ♪ ♪ Maria ♪ [operatic singing continues] [sighs, laughs] It's like La Scala in Milan. You see, in this country, most people think that Puccini is a mushroom. You want a smoke? No, I don't smoke. Do you know what I love about smoking? It's nice to know there's something out there that still can kill you. [chuckles] Now, a little bird came flying, landed on my shoulder, whispered in my ear that you need two passes. Yeah. Follow me. Don't worry, I'm a regular guy like you just trying to make a living. You're a munie, right? So I assume these passes, they're not for you? No, my girl's grandma got sick. Let's start with the girl. Age? Twenty-six. Her full name and social, please? I need a name... because I have to program these passes. You with me? Sara. I need her full name. I get it. You gotta be cautious and you gotta be smart, especially these days, you know. I didn't set up this meeting. You did. And I'm here wasting my goddamn time. If you don't trust me, leave. No. I'm good. You good? You know, we're kinda lucky because we're two munies. I give you my word. And I would like to back it up... the old-fashioned way. What do you say? [chuckles] Good. Feels good, doesn't it? It's like a childhood memory. A bite out of grandma's cookies. So I need the name of the girl, and I need the name of whoever knows about this meeting. Do you understand? And I can stick as many holes in you as I like. - [Harland shouts] - [Nico grunts] [Harland] Come on. Just go in! [panting] [gunshots ricocheting] [sanitation man] Get on the ground! Come on! - What's your name, soldier? - Nico. - Nico, Boomer. - Why are you even helping me? They drag and pull schmucks like you down here to their death. Today, I'm drawing a line in the sand. I like you, bro. One dead body down here stinks up the whole building. Once you get that smell in your nostrils, it lingers. You can't blow it out. Tired of it, man. No more. - [sanitation man] Over here! - Shit! What are you doing? I'm staying. Head downstairs. That'll get you back to the elevators. Stay safe, pilgrim. I'm rooting for ya. Come on! Oh, jeez. How hard can it be, guys? Hey! [dogs howling] [ringtone: Lester's voice] Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. - [beeps] - Lester's Gets. - Distribution... - Cut the crap. Where is he? Who are we talking about now? Your courier, Nico. He showed up here at my house and he accused me of selling black-market passes. [sighs] Well, he's not working today. Don't bullshit me, Lester. I know you sit there and watch your guys drive around all day like rats in a maze. Just give me his GPS or I'm gonna take my business elsewhere. He... Looks like he disabled his GPS. I'll let you know if he comes back online. Yeah, you do that. So? He slipped the leash. What do we pay Harland for? He better get this contained. Yeah. [May] So, it was pre-pandemic, and I met this record exec online, and he saw one of my YouTube videos, and he invited me out here, and he told me that I was gonna be a big star, and then all the shit hit, and I got trapped here. And the record deal that never existed now was gone. It was never gonna happen. He keeps doing this weird dance with me like somehow things are gonna be different, or somehow things are gonna be the way that they were, but the... You know that nothing is ever gonna be the same. And I'm lonely, you know? [exhales] Well, this is nice and light conversation. - You know what I mean? - [laughs, sniffles] I don't know why I'm telling you all this. What's the matter? - Are you okay? What's going on? - Nothing. Is it that guy? The suit you were telling me about? You gonna save me, Dozer? I don't know if you're kidding or not. Do you need saving? - 'Cause I'll come over there. - No, it's okay. If you got it, you got it. No, I'm gonna handle it. - Are you sure? - I'm gonna handle it. - [breathing heavily] - [line ringing] Hey. Hi. What is it? She's gone. Please tell me you have the passes. I don't. I don't have the passes. It's okay. Now I know where I can get some. But when they come, you have to hide. Okay? You cannot let them find you. You do whatever you have to do, but just don't... I need you to buy me a little time. Okay. I'm sorry. I love you. I love you too. [automated female voice] Curfew is now in effect. Daytime essential workers must now return home. Curfew is now in effect. All essential workers must now return home. Hey, I need to see you tonight. No, we... We're done, okay? What, are you playing hard to get? You're driving me crazy. Just... please just let me come over. We don't have to do anything. I just... I need to talk. There's nothing to talk about. And whatever this arrangement is, it's over. May, come on, don't do this. I have tapes. I have tapes of you promising black-market immunity passes. [William] You were recording me? It was just a little life insurance policy. You're dumping me on the phone! William, leave me alone! Or it all goes viral. Okay? - [call disconnects] - [sniffles, sighs] Bitch. What the hell? Going out again? What are you doing? I know about your girlfriend. So what? Oh, no, you think I care that you're screwing someone? No, no. This is about Emma, our daughter. What chance does she have if she gets this thing? I don't know, Piper. What chance do any of us have if we get this thing? I want you out. Give me the gun. Piper, I don't have time for this. You let her tape you? You dumb prick. Give me the gun, let me clean up my mess. You want me to clean it up? Give me the gun. I want you out. What are you gonna do? You gonna shoot me? Get out! [softly] Get out. [door opens, slams] - [grunts] - [gate rattles] [phone ringing] Hello. [Piper] This is Piper Griffin. I believe you know my husband. I think we might be able to help one another. William's on his way over to you. I suggest that you not be there when he arrives. Thank you. No. No, no, Nico! [ringing] Hello. Hi, uh, this is Lester from Lester's Gets. We're one big happy family. Yeah, I know who you are. It's Piper. What can I do for you? Yes, your husband called me earlier today looking for one of my couriers. Yes, have you found him? Yeah, I think so. The thing is... I think he's... inside your house. [automated female voice] Stay in your homes. Repeat, stay in your homes. [indistinct radio chatter] If you attempt to leave your home, you will be shot on sight. [line ringing] [phone ringing] [ringing stops] [automated female voice] If you attempt to leave your home, you will be met with lethal force. Help us to protect you. Please remain in your homes. I need you to get up and get in the bathroom. - What's happening? - Come on, honey. Shh... Put this on. - What's going on? - Shh, shh, shh... [automated female voice] Do not attempt to leave your home. Department of Sanitation! Open up! - [door bursts open] - [Harland] Now where is that girl? You think you can hide? I'll find you. Bingo! Found Grandma! Bag and tag the hag! Hey, where are you? Where the hell is that little duckling? [automated female voice] Stay in your homes. Repeat, stay in your homes. My kingdom for a beer. Nothing. Oh, shi... Roses are red... violets are blue... you think you can hide... but I'll find you. [groans] [heavy, distorted breathing] [automated female voice] Lockdown is still in effect. The Department of Sanitation will relocate the infected. [man] Hey! Hey, give me a hand with this! Are you okay, Bobby? [heavy breathing continues] Then get her outta here. [sanitation man on radio] We have one deceased, one in the wind. Over. [gun cocks] How dare you come into my house. I'm not here to hurt anyone. You've already put my daughter's life at risk just by stepping foot in here. I came to you for help, and you tried to have me killed. Look, I just needed information because I can't allow anyone to know what we're doing here. Nobody knows, and no one will. Mrs. Griffin, I understand you're just trying to protect your daughter. I get that. Because I'm trying to save the one person left in my life that matters to me. I can't leave here without that pass. Please. Please help me. [sighs] Top shelf. Come on, get it down. Open it up. You better not make me regret this. [automated female voice] This building has been condemned. The safest place is your own home. Department of Sanitation. For containment you can trust. [man] Stay with the truck. [Piper] What's her name? I assume it's a girl. Sara Mia Garcia. Now what? Now we wait. [indistinct radio chatter] [in Spanish] [automated female voice] Stay in your homes. We are here to help. If you believe your neighbor is defying mandatory lockdown, give us a call. Do you know where you're gonna go? Far away from here. We're all just trying to protect the ones we love. [computer chimes] Thank you. Take care. Oh, shit. Hey, guys! Hold off! Stop! Okay, call them to stop. Call them to stop! The girl is in a hazmat suit. [sanitation man] Secure all personnel, girl is in disguise. Over. Yeah. Yeah. [line ringing] Hey, are you sure it's okay if I come? No, it's fine. Of course. Of course. - I'll see you soon. - Be safe getting over here. [panting] [drone engine whirring] Okay. [engine cranks] Oh, shit. Goddamn it. Come on. Come on. [engine cranking] Get out of the car, May. You wanna play? - Please leave me alone! - What? You wanna play? Let's play! Let's play! Get out! Get out of the car or I'll kill you. Did you think you were just gonna leave me? I'll drag you out by your neck. Get out! Get out! Get out! I'll pull you right through! Get out! [May screams] Tango is down. We're at bingo fuel. Recalling. [shouts] We're going. We're going home. [helicopter passing overhead] [Harland] Nice try. - Take this off. Get it off. - [Sara grunting] Relax, breathe it in. Breathe it in. You don't get it, do you? [laughs] You're not stupid. No symptoms... after being locked up with your infectious grandma. You'd be coughing up your lungs right now, and that makes you immune. If that's true, then let me go. I'm so sorry. That's not how it works. Take her. Sara! Sara! Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, no! Sara! [panting] [Harland hums] Well, she really captured your likeness. Talented girl. Who are you? Before this shit started to hit the fan, I used to drive garbage trucks for the Department of Sanitation. Then all of a sudden, my superiors... they started to die off. [chuckles] And then one day, I was running the whole damn department. [laughs] I did it. Four aces. It's called the Idiot. Look. Happens once in a lifetime. Emmett D. Harland, once a lowly refuse collector, is now the thin blue line between death... [chuckles] and a miserable existence. Hey, uh, what about yourself? What did you do before the fall? I was a paralegal. I was putting myself through law school. Oh. Well, I guess it didn't work out for everybody. That's your problem, Nico. You don't seem to understand how good... us munies have it, huh? Only a handful of us, like you and me, we're allowed to roam around as we like. You want a new car? Just go to the dealership and drive it off. Go into a house up in the hills and just take over. We're untouchable. You see, munies... we're not human anymore. [chuckles] We're gods. And how do you use your godly power? Huh? You run around and you try to save some specimen that is bound to die. I mean, what's wrong with you? You could have the whole fucking world. Where's Sara? Oh, Sara? I don't know. She's halfway to the Q-zone by now, I guess. I'm sorry. You won't be joining her. - [groans] - [Nico grunts] [retches] It's nice to know there's something still out there that can kill you. [Harland coughs] [groans] [recorded ringtone] Answer the phone. Answer the phone. - Answer the... - Nico? I got something I gotta tell you. Yeah, you told the Griffins I was at their house. - Fair to say you owe me one? - I'm sorry, man. There's a sanitation transport headed for the Q-zone. I need to find it. That ain't gonna be easy. I have an ID, 0715-GLS. [Lester] I think I might know someone who can help. [line rings] I've already mapped out every route from Sara's place to the zone. We gotta search grid by grid. Copy that. [beeping] Keep heading southeast. We're not seeing anything behind you. H-Hold up! Hold up! Yup, 0715-GLS. The truck is headed south on Western. I repeat, south on Western. [Dozer] We have visual confirmation. Target is heading... Heading east on 8th. We got 'em. Nico! We found her. She's headed east on 8th, just past Western. They're almost at the zone, so you better book. [Nico] I copy that. [Lester] You're not gonna make it, man. Hurry up! [woman, through PA] You have arrived at Q-zone Alpha. Welcome to Q-zone Alpha. You must follow all directions. All instructions are mandatory. Prepare for immediate processing. Proceed to holding area for decontamination. [man] Let's go. [Sara grunting] - [men yelling] - [Sara] Help me! [inaudible] - Just trust me, okay? - I trust you. On your knees! Get on your knees now! [muffled] Get on your knees! [Nico] Don't hurt her. [muffled shout] She's immune! She's immune! Scan the bracelet! - [grunts] - Scan it. [man] She's got a bracelet! [scanner beeps] [policeman] Run the ID. She's good. ID checks out. She's good. - I... - [Sara] It's okay. I'm like you. Lester, it's Nico. We got her. We're getting out of here. [laughs] [sniffs] [sighs] We're going home.

I wanted to thank you for helping us get out. And for helping a kid who lost everything find a purpose. You know, I realize now we weren't just delivering packages. We were delivering hope. Harland and Griffin were reportedly selling illegal immunity bracelets to wealthy buyers on the Westside. And in a stunning revelation, Griffin's own wife and a popular online streamer who had evidence of the crimes worked together to expose the conspiracy.
