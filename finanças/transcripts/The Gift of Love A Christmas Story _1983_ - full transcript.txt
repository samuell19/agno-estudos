[projector reel] - [Voiceover] This is the story of a search for simple values. If it should have the qualities of a fable, we might remember that for centuries the fable has been the storehouse for all those things that we know in our hearts to be true. [light orchestral music] [bugle playing 'Hark the Herald Angels Sing'] - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - That's the only contribution we've had all morning. I think we're wasting our time here. - Well let's try out at the new shopping mall. - All right with me. - Good morning Rose. Merry Christmas. - I'm so glad you're here Mrs. Broderick, there's a terrible rumor making the rounds. - Oh... - What's this terrible rumor? -They say the store's closing. That today's our last day. Well, that's simply not true. - I'm relieved to hear it. Thanks. - Right. I'll see you later. - There's a small bonus in your pay envelope. I wish it were more. Excuse me. Janet could you just give me a minute? - How am I supposed to find another job, this close to Christmas? - Chris I can't afford you. - Then maybe you oughtta close the place down. - I may have to. - What's going on? - I just had to let Chris go, some of the others too. - Somebody's spreading a rumor downstairs, saying the store's closing. - We are in bad shape, Janet. You've seen what it's like down there. - Well we've had slow Christmases before. We always cut our losses with the New Year's sale, After the first of the year, everything'll be better. - We may not make it to the first of the year. Every day we stay open we're losing money. - Did you see the ad we're preparing for tomorrow's paper? Come to Broderick's for an old fashioned Christmas. - That's been our whole problem, we've been too old fashioned. We haven't kept up with the times. - I think this ad really can do it. You might even need to put on extra help, and you better get that Santa Claus back in. There'll be a run on toys. - Janet you're not hearing me. - Is there more than you're saying? - No. I, uh... look I... I have to get downstairs. - Okay. I'll be in my office. [yelling] - Hit him Dorothy! - Michael! - You're gonna pay for that, son. - Stick it in your ear, Dorothy. - Stop it! - What's going on here? - She started it. - Dorothy Broderick do you mind telling me what this argument is all about? - Dustin was picking on my little brother. - He started it. He called me a dummy. - He is a dummy. - He's always showing off, because he's in the gifted child program. - There'll be no more fighting. If I hear of any more fighting, you're both going to get extra home work. - Now shake hands and go on home. - Come on kids. We can all go home. - There's nothing you can do for me? Well then I guess that's it. Bye. - [sigh] Mr. Broderick. - Let's start to shut down. - I just can't believe it. After so many years. Your father... your grandfather. - I know. Believe me I know. - Shall I call Mrs. Broderick in? - No. I don't know how to tell her. - Hi Grandma. - Hello you two. - Something smells good, Grandma. - My Christmas pudding. - When do we eat it? - Christmas dinner. - What are you doing to it? - Oh I'm stirring in a bit of Sherry. It's an old English custom. - Will Sherry make you drunk? - Well if you got too much of it, it might make you a bit tipsy. What's this I hear about you being in another fight? - How'd you hear about that? - Well Dustin's mother called looking for your mother. What was it about this time? - Me. - Ah... You showing off your superior intelligence again? - Yes ma'am. - It seems to me Michael, it's time you learned to take care of yourself. - No need to. Dorothy does all my fighting for me. - Well maybe I might be able to give you a pointer or two. Here. Come on now make a fist. Two of them. Now, be alert. - Put your guard up Michael. - Watch her, she's gonna surprise you. - Come on Grandma wouldn't hit me. - Oh I most certainly shall if you don't try to protect yourself now. - You wouldn't - Oooh - Hey! Grandma, it's not nice. - Well put up your guard or I'll let you have it again. That's the boy. Good. That's wonderful. Good. Good. Now, Put a little more zip into it. Now c'mon. Oh harder. Harder. Harder, harder. That's the boy. [laughing] [gasping] - What's the matter Grandma? - Well I... Oh god, I'm not quite sure. Something hurts like a holy curse. - Watch your language in front of young children. - I'm afraid I forgot. Here you two, give me a hand. - Are you all right Grandma? - I think we should try to head for the stairs. Yeah, I think I'm gonna lie down for awhile. - Are you dying Grandma? - God, I hope not. I tell you one thing, I refuse to die in the kitchen. - [Janet] Miss Powers? Neil? - In here Mrs. Broderick. - Where's Neil? - He's down on the first floor. [crying] - What is going on here? - I tried to tell you this morning. It's all over honey. - What do you mean? You're closing the store? I don't believe it. - I had to. - Why? We could have gone to the bank, I mean we could have done something to keep on going. - I have been to the bank, I have talked to the lawyers, I have done everything I know how to do. - Oh, well you never told me any of that. - I thought that I could pull us out without... - Oh so you just went ahead and made a decision like this without even... without even talking to me. - I should have. - You think you're alone here? I mean this place is us, not just you. This store is our life. - Forget the store. We have more than that. - I wonder. - Now hold on. - Well what do you expect me to think, when you pull a thing like this? - Do you think it doesn't hurt me to give up? I didn't want to hurt you. - Well you have. - Janet. Wait. - I can't be with you right now. I have to... I'll walk home. [melancholy music] Hello you two. - Mom, Dr. Graham is upstairs with Grandma. - What? What happened? - Grandma was showing Michael how to box and all of a sudden she had trouble breathing and she's hurting a lot. - She told us to clean up. - What happened Carter? - She's resting now. She says she feels fine, but I'm not so sure. I'm going to keep a close eye on her. Janet, has your mother complained about anything lately? No she's been fine, but you know mother, she has the strength of two people. Should she be in the hospital? - I suggested that, but she threatened me with bodily harm. Sometimes Amanda can be an exasperating woman. I wouldn't want to force her to do anything against her will. - Well I doubt anybody's ever forced her to do anything and lived to tell about it. - I'll look in on her tomorrow. In the meantime call me if there's any change. - Well... should I do anything? - I've given her a sedative. She'll probably sleep for the rest of the night. - Well thank you. - Good night. - Good night. - I'll let myself out. - Okay. - Janet? - Mother. - Oh, I don't know what happened. I used to be able to go 10 rounds. - You just over did it. - Well I've always tried to keep it from close friends and family, but the fact of the matter is, the old girl is mortal. - I don't accept that. - Where are the children? We were making Christmas pudding. - They're downstairs. - oh I've got to clean up the kitchen. - No. No. No. Dorothy and Michael are cleaning up the kitchen. - I am extremely tired. I don't usually tire so easily. - You just rest. - I was dreaming... of the secret place. - What is the secret place mother? All my life I've heard about the secret place. What is it? Where is it? - We used to go there, your father and I. - I used to look for it when I was a little girl. - Your father's probably there right now, waiting. - Father's dead. - One day, he and I were in an electrical storm, and I was so frightened. I hid in his arms until it was over. - Sleep now. - I baked a goose that Christmas. - Sleep. [ tv program playing] - How's Grandma feeling? - Oh she's asleep now. I think she's gonna be all right. Has your father come in yet? - No, but um, Dustin's mother called. She wants you to call. - Oh God. Did she say what she wants? - I think it was about the fight I got into with Dustin today. - Dorothy I have asked you repeatedly not to get into fights. There are other ways to solve problems. - Mom it was my fault. Dustin called me a dummy. - Well that's no reason to fight either. And if it is then you should have fought yourself and not asked your sister to do it. - [Dorothy] Mom are you okay? - No. Tell you the truth, I don't seem to be able to handle today. Sorry kids. [Front door opening] Mother's not well. I'll be upstairs with her. [sighs] - How is she? - Oh she uh, she woke up a couple times in the night, but she's sleeping now. What will you do today? I'll be at the store. Lots of paperwork. Talk to the lawyers. - Will there be anything left when it's all settled? - I'm hoping we can hold onto the house. - Well that would be some comfort. - I could start over again. People do that all the time these days. - Would you stop dreaming? It's not gonna be that easy. - We'll start small. The way my family did with the store a 100 years ago. Til then I'll find a job somewhere. - This is not a 100 years ago. The economy's rotten and there aren't that many jobs out there. Everything's changed. Including us. - We're older, that's all. - But that's not all. We've lost touch with each other. We can't even talk any more without it becoming an argument. - Janet I have been under incredible pressure with the store falling apart. - And what about me? Aren't I supposed to have feelings? I don't understand what's happened to us. - Mother? - What is it Dorothy? - I think you better go look in on Grandma. - Yeah I'm going to take her some breakfast in a minute. - I think you better come look now. She won't wake up. [somber music] - [Janet] I'm so afraid Mother. I don't know how to go on without you. I always felt there was something you knew, that would make me strong. A secret that you didn't tell me that would make my life, as rich as yours seemed to be. Was there something you knew and didn't tell me? Oh I need you Mother. I need you. - Honey you're freezing cold. Let me take you home. - Nothing medical that I can find, but she seems in some deep depression. - You know how things have been going lately. First the store and now her mother's death. - For all those reasons, we better keep a special eye on her. Call me if you need me. Otherwise I'll stop by early tomorrow morning. - Thank you Carter. - MmHm. - Oh Mother. [moaning and sighing] Mother I need you. I'm lost. I wanna go home. - [Amanda] We can be there by morning, if we hurry. - Mother? - Yes dear. I'm here. - I don't feel well Mother. - You need to be home. Come. - Grandma you're alive. - Where are we going? - Home. - We are home. - We're going with Grandma to her house. - Great. - Mom look. - Oh wow a sleigh. Neat where did that come from? - Daddy. It's so good to see you again. - Hello my darling girl. - How's my old citizen? First rate! - Grandpa is that you? - Indeed it is. - I thought you were dead. - Just a rumor. Now let's all go on home. G'yap. [sleigh bells] [lighthearted music] See you in about two minutes. - Can I go with you Grandpa? - You better get inside and get warm. We'll visit the animals later. - Oh Mother it's so good to be home. - Sometimes home is the best remedy there is. [sighs deeply] - And the house looks wonderful. - Janet. - Aunt Min. - Aunt Min and I turned everything upside down getting ready for Christmas. I can't believe it's only three days off and still so much to do, but we had a corking good time, didn't we Minerva? - Til I pinched my sciatic nerve. Twinges like sin when it's about to rain. How are you Janet? - Well I'm... alright I guess. - Children. - Hi Aunt Min. - Hello Aunt Min. - Well come on everyone, front room's for company, kitchen's for family. - When can we go up in the attic? - Well first we're going to warm up with some hot chocolate. Anyone wants anything stronger, better head over to Mcguire's saloon. - All right go on inside. Everybody find a place somewhere. - What are you painting these days, Mother? - Skaters on the mill pond. I can't seem to get it right. - Is the mill pond frozen over yet? - Yes, but not thick enough for skating. - I always loved the mill pond. It's where I first met Neil. [car horn honking] - I seem to be lost. - Where you headed? Mount Snow. Vermont. Am I near either one? - Well you found Vermont. Mount Snow's that way about 20 miles. - You're very beautiful, did you know that? - Thank you. - Come to Mount Snow with me? I think there's a good chance we could fall in love, but, uh, we better make sure we do anything reckless. - [laughing] Well thank you, but I'm about to do something reckless all on my own. - Tell me and I'll join you. - Well I'll tell you, but there's no way in the world you're gonna join me. - Where you headed, Tibet? - New York City. - I'm not sure I'm ready for New York City, I'm a small town boy. - Go skiing. You'll love Mount Snow. - What's your name? - In Vermont we don't give our names to strangers. - Even half a name? - It's Janet. Look I have a train to catch and I'm in kind of a hurry, so... Enjoy your skiing. - Good-bye, okay? - Good-bye Janet. We could have had a wonderful life together. [car engine starts] - [Minerva] Why anybody would want to live in New York City is beyond me. [train whistle] It's too hot in the summer, too cold in the winter. People trying to run you down in taxi cabs. - Well that train better get going. The longer I look at you the more, the more I'm convinced you shouldn't go. - Oh, - Got your ticket? - One ticket. - Darling before you go there's something I want you to have. I had planned for you to unwrap it after you got to New York, but I've decided I want to see your face. - [gasps] Oh! - You like it? - Thank you. It's wonderful. - [Neil] Janet! You can't go. - Huh? - How do you do? - Hello sir. - Daddy this is uh... uh... I... he was lost and I directed him to Mount Snow, a little while ago. - About five miles up the road I realized I wasn't looking for Mount Snow at all. I had a devil of a time finding you. I uh... I was wondering if you might marry me? - [laughing] I don't even know your name. - My name is Neil Broderick, I'm from Elyria, Ohio. And the only bad habit I have is smoking cigarettes, but I'm trying to give that up. And I'm in very good health, I'm an Episcopalian. My hobbies are fishing, and gardening, and... you are the first girl I've ever proposed to in my life. - Well I wish you better luck with the next one. - Five miles up the road I knew that you were the girl for me. - Mom, Dad... do something. Talk to him. - Ah... - Um... - Well in addition to getting yourself lost and um, fishing and gardening and smoking, what are your other interests? - Well my family owns a department store back in Elyria. My father's just retired and after this vacation I'm supposed to go back and take over the store. - His prospects look good. Solid background. Good Ohio family. I think you should listen to him. - [Conductor] All aboard, Montpelier... - I'm going to miss my train. - Where will you live there? - She's an artist. She's going to live in a garret in Greenwich Village. - Well we don't have any garrets back in Elyria, but there's a very nice studio in the store. - Mr. Broderick I don't know the first thing about you, but I do know that the last thing I want to do with my life is spend it in Eyria, Ohio. Now would you please just go away. - Bye. - Good-bye. - Where would I find you in New York? - Would you please go back to Elyria? Forget you ever saw me. - Bye. - [Conductor] All aboard. [train engine accelerating] - Dad remember the Christmas trees we used to get? Cutting them down ourselves. - Well there're some left. Not many, but a few. - When can we go look? - What's wrong with right now? - Yea! - Come on Grandpa! - Oh you children be careful, you wanna break every piece of china in the house. - We're sorry Aunt Min. Come on Grandpa let's go. - Hurry Mom! - Like old times isn't it? - Yes it sure is. - Dorothy see if you can find some sticks, we'll put a red ribbon on the end of 'em. Uh, Janet the saw is over there somewhere. - Do they have names? - The drake's Methuselah. Four young ones are Eenie, Meenie, Miney, and Mo. White one, that's Brunhilda. Having her for Christmas dinner. - How are you gonna... kill her? - She's gonna have to part with her head. - Think I'll have cold cereal for Christmas dinner. - I don't think I can eat anything that's been alive. - Come on everybody, let's go get our tree. - [Dorothy] Well what about this one? - [Michael] No, it's too small. - [Dorothy] Here's a good one. - [Michael] No there's gotta be better ones. - Glad you came home Janet. - There's something I need here, Dad. - Maybe it's just to be home again. See the old faces. Sleep in the bed you grew up in. Helps to figure things out. - [Michael] Let's try back there. - Dad, where's the secret place? - It's here abouts. - Is it a real place? - Oh yes. - Well then why don't you just show it to me? - Well it's like your mother always said. "Won't mean anything unless you find it yourself". - Neil and I have hit rock bottom, Dad. I don't know how to go on -- Home's not a bad place, to look back over your life, see what went wrong, what went right. Helps to bring everything into focus. - [Dorothy] Grandpa we found it. - [Michael] Look at this one Grandpa. - Oh wow that's huge. - Look at this Grandpa. - That's as good a one as I've seen in a long time. - Yeah. The star goes right at the top. - Is it a unanimous decision? - That's it. - That's the tree we want. - Janet? - Perfect. - Alright. Now here, you pound this in the ground right next to the trunk. - Why? - Because, whenever we cut a tree down we plant one in its place in the spring. - Why? - Well Mother Nature gives us this tree, it's only fair to give her one in return. - That's great. I like that idea. - So did your mother. She started this custom when she was just a little girl. - Timber! [chopping] - [Michael] Aren't we going to take it in the house? - [Grandpa] We're going to put a stand on it first. In the meantime, we'll leave it here in the barnyard so the animals can enjoy it. - Hey you guys, Merry Christmas. - Better get inside. Grandma's gonna have supper on the table soon. - Dorothy come here a minute. - What do you want? - This goose has a really big problem. She's going to die. - Yeah. And I'm going to eat her for Christmas dinner. - Yuck. - [Janet] Dorothy. Michael. - Sounds like supper's ready. Come on. - Dorothy. We've got to do something about this goose. - Michael you've got to do something about this goose. I'm not fighting your battles any more. - Nobody's going to cook you for Christmas dinner, Brunhilda. Not while I'm around. Ouch. 16th time I've stuck myself. - Well look try putting the needle through like that. - I'm running out of popcorn. - Well the next batch is ready. - I'll get it Janet. - Thanks Aunt Min. - When I grow up and have a wife and a Christmas tree of my own I'm not gonna put anything on it but decorations I buy at the store. What about you Dorothy? - I'm not going to get married. I'm going to be an old... a maiden lady. - What have you got against marriage? - I don't see why anybody bothers. - I sometimes wonder too. - Dorothy you're absolutely right. Marriage is a ridiculous arrangement. I mean imagine two people pairing off and swearing before God and man to love, honor, and obey each other until death do them part. - Ridiculous. - On the other hand. It's an arrangement that's worked rather well for some people. I mean take your grandpa and me for instance. I couldn't imagine life without that old citizen. - Well I still don't know. I mean how can you ever be sure if you'll get along. I mean sure I want to have someone I can have fun with, but how can you ever be sure? - [Grandpa] I never saw you look more beautiful. - Oh suddenly I don't know why I'm doing this at all. - Now if you have any doubts, it's a little late to bring them up now. - But I don't know him, Dad. I don't know the first thing about him. And Elyria, Ohio. I could get trapped up there. - I'm sure he'll let you out for Christmas. Labor Day? - He better. - I like Neil. I liked him right from the start. - You don't know him either. - I expect I know what's going through his mind right now. - What do you mean? How could you? - Because I've been there myself. I remember standing there, my best man at my side, my knees turning to water, waiting for your mother to come down the aisle and thinking I don't deserve her. Please God, make me a better man so I'll be all she expects me to be. - You think that's what Neil's thinking now? - Something like it. I suspect that's why we get tearful at weddings. Two young people stand at the alter. Their love for each other is so visible, so exposed. Old timers know it won't always be that way. Time will take its toll life will ask steep prices for all its pleasures, but just for that one moment the radiance of two young people with their life together spread out in front of them gives hope and wonder and strength to everyone who witnesses it. - He's handsome. Not too handsome, just... handsome enough wouldn't you say? - Yes I would say that. - Sense of humor. Whenever I'm low he can make me laugh. - That's much to his credit. - Well I guess... I better do it. - He's a good man Janet. I wouldn't give you away to him if I had any doubts. [organ playing 'Here Comes the Bride'] - Mother, you know what I really long for? - Tell me. - Well to make this Christmas absolutely perfect I think we should have one of your burnt orange cakes. - Oh my. I haven't made one of those in years. Not since you were a little girl. - Well let me see. I'll uh, need cinnamon. Where can I find two Christmas helpers to go to the store for me? - Here. - Me. - Well when you get there I want you to ask Mrs. Prince to give you uh, four oranges and six cinnamon sticks and two pounds of chestnuts to stuff the goose with. Shall I make a list? - We'll remember Grandma. - Well don't dawdle. - I don't even know what dawdle means. - It means to walk funny. - Maybe I better go along and see these youngsters get there and back. - What do you want for Christmas, Mike? - Everything. - What do you want Aunt Min? - A rose. - That's a weird present to want. - Then why did you have to ask me for? Come on let's get the shopping done now scoot both of ya. [church bell ringing] - I want to look at the candy. - [Minerva] How are you Sara? - I want some of those. - You can't get all of those. - Come on Dorothy. - No Michael. - Minerva. - Afternoon Abigail. - Can I help you? - No I'll just look around. - Dorothy? - Oh hello Russell. What are you doing here? - I'm spending Christmas with my grandparents. - So are we. - Hi Michael. - Hi Russ. Read any good books lately? - I'm working my way through the "Encyclopedia Britannia". - Russell there is more to life than sitting in a library reading books. - Did you people come to shop or to talk? - These are Amanda and Spencer Fenwick's grandchildren. - I memorize you two. Came here to visit last summer from out west somewhere. - Ohio. - Janet went out there to marry a department store. Did right good for herself, story goes. - Did you want something special Minerva? - I'll let you know if I see anything Abigail. - What can we do for you children? - My grandma sent us to pickup four oranges, six cinnamon sticks, and two pounds of chestnuts. - And what's your grandma having for Christmas? - A goose. - She's finally cooking old Brunhilda. - Mr. Prince will you please just fill the order? - How about it Dorothy? - How about what? - Would you like to go ice skating with me? - I don't think I ought to Russell. I've got weak ankles. I'd hate to turn my ankle and have to be carried home on a stretcher. - Did you find what you want Minerva? - Yes Abigail thank you. This'll do it. - Afternoon Abigail. - Bye. - Merry Christmas. -[Mr. Prince] Merry Christmas -[Abigail } Merry Christmas. - [Michael] Hi we're back. - [Dorothy] Hi Mom. - Well I was about to come looking for you. - Did you find what you were looking for Minerva? - Russell is staying with his grandparents. - Mrs. Prince sure hollers at Mr. Prince. - Never did appreciate what she got. - Christmas Ghost is late this year. - Who's that? - Usually come and gone by now. - What's a ghost want around here anyway? - Well every year a few nights before Christmas he comes, leaves a gift, and then disappears until next Christmas. - Who does he leave the gift for? - Me. - Here, put it up. - Okay. - Here's the little blue soldier, Spence. - Oh that's a good one. Just about finished. -[Dorothy] It's so beautiful. - [Janet] Isn't it? - [Minerva] The trees were always prettiest when your mother chose them. - Well it's not just the tree, it's everything. - Here's the last one. - Thanks Grandma. [organ plays 'Silent Night'] - [Michael] Here we go. - [Minerva] Anybody ready for a gingerbread man? - [Janet] Always. - Amanda. What is it honey? - Oh I'm happy. - Then why the tears? - I don't know. It's just having Janet and the kids home again. All being together. And having you, Spence. - Always my dear. Well what else is it? - I suppose I'm afraid. - Of what? - Things not being this way anymore, and... being alone, and... of not having you. - Can't always be the same. But you are stuck with me. - What's the matter Mother? - The old girl's having a good cry. - Oh I have not. - Why? - There are just some cracks in your mother's armor. - Those boys are tearing up the yard. Maybe we should go out and speak to them. Who are they? - Well what do they look like? - Well one's a little squirt. The other one's dressed like a soldier and he's cute. - The little squirt would be Raymond. The cute one is Chance Mayfield. New family in town. - Come on Mike let's go make some money. - How? - We'll sell mistletoe. I saw a ton of it out when we went looking for the Christmas tree. - No trouble this time Dorothy. - Why do you keep snapping at those children? - Well, you're a funny one to be asking that. - It's different with me, I'm an old crab apple, but you Janet you don't appreciate what you've got. - What do you mean? - You married a fine man and you have a family who loves ya, it's about time you took notice. [scuffling and yelling] - You wanna fight huh? - Up to you. - Come on Dorothy get him. - For Pete's sake, cut it out. She's a girl. - Thanks for rescuing a maiden in distress. - What's your name? - Dorothy. - And I'm the Wizard of Oz. - What's yours? - Chance Mayfield. - Chance. What an interesting name that is. - It's really Chancellor. - Chance suits you much better. - Would you like to come to a party, Dorothy? - I'd like that. - There's one tomorrow night at Melody Webber's house. - I'm afraid I couldn't come unless Melody asked me herself. - She told us to ask anybody we like. It's a costume party. Everybody's supposed to dress funny. - That sounds like a lot of fun. I'd like to come. - Me too. - C'mon Michael, we're going to sell mistletoe. - What'd you do that for? - Aw, she probably won't even turn up. - Well for her sake I hope she doesn't. - You really do the most beautiful work mother. - Now you know where you got your talent. - What talent? I haven't painted in years. - I went through a time like that. I kept waiting for the inspiration to do something extraordinary, like the Sistine Chapel. Then one day I decided to try a snowflake and found my calling. - Well maybe that's where I failed Neil. Never giving up my high blown ideas of becoming a great artist. - Oh I don't for a minute agree that you failed Neil. It seems to me you gave him your talent in a very meaningful way. [knock] - Yes? - I'm sorry to disturb you Mr. Broderick, but there's someone outside who insists on seeing you. - Who is it and what does he want? - It's a woman, she says she wants to talk to you about a job in the art department. - Well tell her we haven't got an art department. - Tell her an ad agency handles all that stuff. - But she's very persistent. I think you ought to see her. - I haven't got time to talk to some lunatic who's applying for a job that doesn't even exist. Send her to the employment office. - I really think you ought to talk to her. - Alright. - You stick around in case we have to throw her out or something. - Would you come in please? - Hi. - Hey. - Janet you better wait outside, there's some disturbed person waiting to see me. - I'm not in the least disturbed, but I could create quite a scene if you don't hear what I have to say. - This is the applicant I mentioned. - Oh... thank you Miss Powers. - Janet I am trying to run a store here. - And I want to help you. Neil I've been studying the ads for the store and the artwork is terrible, the copy's even worse, and I'm sure it discourages more people than it brings in. - I've been telling them that at the agency. - Well nobody's using that studio on the top floor. I want to set up an office there. I want to write the ads, design the copy. And while I'm at it I think I can probably do a better job on window displays than whoever's doing them now. - Janet. A woman's place is... - Is beside her husband. - But you don't have to work. - But I want to work. I want to be here. I want to be with you. - What about Dorothy? - Dorothy will be right beside my drafting table. - How are you going to take care of her and work at the same time? - All Dorothy needs now is a lot of love and a change of diapers. Checked the baby department and they have lots of diapers. - I don't know about this Janet. - Well while you're thinking it over, I'll just go and check out the studio and see where we want to put the baby's bed. - Janet. You're being very high-handed about this. - Wait til you hear my salary demands. - [Amanda] Did you find the mistletoe you were looking for? - [Dorothy] Found it and sold it. - Russell bought most of it. He's in love with Dorothy. I expect he's planning to kiss her. - Well he better not try anything with me. - That's because she's in love with Chance Mayfield. - You want to lose a tooth? - Dorothy that's enough. - How come you and Dad don't kiss any more, Mom? - Oh, uh... well sometimes people just... grow apart and uh... they don't... they have trouble showing how they really feel about each other. - I saved this for you and Dad. Oh... [somber music] - How do I look? - Kind a cute. - Maybe I'll wear this to the costume party, except I don't like the hat. Here's one I like better. What are you gonna wear? - I think maybe I'll go as a clown. I always did want to be a clown. - You know how I'd celebrate Christmas if I had my way? - You'd probably eat all the turkey stuffing all by yourself. - Remember last Fourth of July, when we set off firecrackers? - I'll never forget it. - That's how I'd celebrate Christmas. I'd set off the biggest firecrackers I could find. Hundreds of 'em. I'd wake the world up on Christmas Eve. - That's kind of a good idea. - Too bad we haven't got any firecrackers. - We do. I hid a whole package of five inch ones. Rockets too. - Hey. - Mike where are the firecrackers? - Right here. - Just look at those babies. - Spent just about my life savings on them. - Let's set one off. - No. We're saving them all to celebrate on Christmas Eve. Put 'em back where I had 'em. [sighs] - I never knew you to be so fuzzy-headed Janet. Where are you now? - Mother, can love just die? I mean can two people just stop loving one another? - All couples go through that. It's not terminal. - It feels like it. [thunderstorm] [door closing] I almost wish you'd taken a mistress. - Don't come on to me with that kind of talk Janet. I put in a hard day and I'm tired. - I'd know how to fight a woman, but how do I fight work? - You're talking silly. You work as hard as I do. - It's 12:30 and you're just getting homefrom the office. - The days aren't long enough for all I have to do. - And what do you have to do so late? - I'm falling behind Janet. Things are piling up. Don't you add to it. - How could anything I say possibly influence you? You never hear a word I say. - You don't listen. - What's to listen to? You never talk to me. - All right. I'm listening. - We've lost something Neil. - What? What have I done? What is wrong between us? - I wish I knew. Maybe it's just what happens to people when they get older. - I'm not old and you're not old either. So it's not that. - You used to be so kind and thoughtful. You used to call me in the middle of the day. No reason at all. - And when I would come home at night, you'd be waiting. Smelling of perfume and the table all lit with candles. - I suppose it was foolish to think that that would last. - I did for a while. - Then it went away. Why? - I don't know. - I really don't know. I don't know. I really don't know. - I've seen love survive where there didn't seem to be a chance of either side responding to the other. Closer to home than you'd think. - What are you trying to tell me? - Something about the power of love to endure, when you take the time to look for it. Work at it. - Maybe Neil and I just didn't take enough time for ourselves. - Your father and I did and we found our secret place. - Well then show me how to find it. - I can't show you dear. It's not on the map. And don't go looking in the geography book for it. - This is very pretty Mother. Prettiest one you ever made. Crowning touch for the tree. [tower bells ringing] - [Dorothy] Sometimes you really get everything right. You know what I mean? - [Michael] Like tonight? - Yeah. If there is a prize for best costume, I bet I'll win it. - I'll tell you a secret. - What will it cost me? - This one you can have for free. I really feel good. - You look good. - Yeah, so do you. - How's my lipstick? - You've got too much on, but it's too late to do anything about it now. [door chime] - Well we've been waiting for you two. Come on in. [group laughs] - Are you alright? - I keep hoping my diphtheria shot didn't take and it'll hit me all of a sudden and I'll die. - I'd miss you an awful lot. - Just go away and let me cry for a while. - I'll close the door in case you make a racket. [sleigh bells] Listen. - What's the matter with you? - I think it's Santa Claus. - Oh Michael. - Intellectually I know it's impossible, but emotionally I keep hoping. Dorothy come here a minute. What do you make of it? - The Christmas Ghost. Come on. Quiet. - [Minerva] Come in out of the cold. [grandfather clock chiming] Thank you. Made some dandelion wine last summer. I put it up to mellow just for tonight. - How are you Minerva? - Well the years are catching up Hannibal. - Each one seems to go faster than the last. I still love you Minerva. - To my Christmas Ghost. [glasses clink] - [Michael] It's Mr. Prince. - You've gotten grayer. - It's about time. - Well, catch me up. Tell me all the news. - Russell's mother and father are divorcing. - Oh no. - Neither of them seems to want the boy, so he's with us. Sweetens my days to have him there. And you Minerva? - Oh, people put up with me. I'm becoming a sharp-tongued old woman Hannibal. But the minute I say the words, I wish I could call them home again. - I walked to Heaven's Hill not long ago. Remember the time we there and flew the kite? - Yes. We couldn't have been more than 20. Just the two of us and that kite, you made out of wrapping paper. I can still see the face of the dragon you drew on it. And the tail, the tail must have been a dozen feet long. Whipping and snapping in the wind. I didn't see how anyone could ever get it up into the air. - But the two of us did. - I remember your arms around me and the wind tugging at the kite. And the feeling that the two of us were up there, soaring on the wind. You were so close, I could feel the beating of your heart. - Mustn't stay long. - That was the bargain, wasn't it? - Merry Christmas Minerva. - And to you too Hannibal. [melancholy music] [sighs] - What are you two doing down here? - We just saw the Christmas Ghost. He was with Aunt Min. - Is everything all right Aunt Min? - What are you folks doing up so late? - We saw the man that was here. - I didn't see any man, just a ghost that comes at Christmas. - Was he your sweetheart once? - Dorothy. - It's all right Janet. Yes, he was along time ago. Oh he was a wild young man. He was the first to come to a party and the last to leave it. He had a reputation for being fast with the ladies. And my mother and father didn't like that. So when he asked for my hand, my family stood in the way. I ran away with him once, but they caught us. Brought me back. Sent me to Portland for two years to live with relatives. While I was gone, he married Abigail Huddleston. But when he looked at me, I knew he loved me. And then one year on Christmas Eve, a rose was left on my window sill. Year after year, a single rose. After a while he started coming in for a few minutes. And that would give me something to... look forward to, til Christmas came again. - Aunt Min didn't you have another sweetheart? - For some people there's only one. - I love you Aunt Min. - Come here. Come here Janet and let me hug you too. [Aunt Min] Oh... Christmas has certainly crept up on me this year. Here it is Christmas Eve and I haven't even finished my shopping. Could you use a ride down to the store Min? I'll walk. Thank you Spence. My sciatica is easing up. Might enjoy the walk. - Can I go with you, Aunt Min? - Well you certainly cannot. I want your Christmas present to be a surprise. - Want to do something Dorothy? - Don't bother me Michael, I'm in a very bad mood. - She's got a broken heart. - I have not. - Well the thing about a broken heart is that it mends. - Not mine. - Well sometimes it seems to take forever and then suddenly one day you find the old ticker is just as strong and as sturdy as it always was. - Well if I'm not back by dark send for the police. - Spend lots of money Minerva. I'm expecting a very expensive gift. [laughing] - Dorothy, let's do something. - Leave me alone Michael. The way I feel I may not live through this day. - You nit. Mom he kicked me. - Did not. - Did too. Look, my leg is bleeding 60 miles an hour. - Just stop screaming and yelling you two. And go outside and play, and behave yourself. - I never do anything right, do I? - Is that the way it seems to you? Those two are where I've failed the most. - Oh they don't seem like failures to me. I mean all children bicker. - Oh it's not just the bickering, Mother. Dorothy's carrying this tomboy thing on forever. And Michael's constantly in her shadow. - They're good kids Janet. And I think they really love each other. You must remember you're an only child. I think if you can imagine what it would have been like if you'd had a brother, you'd be able to understand their relationship better. - But Dorothy's always fighting his battles for him. Hardly a day goes by, she doesn't come home with a black eye. - I suppose you've forgotten Pauline Gates. - Oh that awful girl I went to school with? - She stuck chewing gum in your hair. - Oh... what made you think of her? - As I recall, it was a landmark. You graduated from fighting to name calling. - How did I manage that? - You and I had a little talk. And I tried to remember how it felt to be a 13 year old. - Oh yes. I remember that. Want to go for a walk? - Guess I've got nothing better to do. - When I was 13 I fell out of that tree right over there. Broke my arm. - It's hard to think of you climbing a tree. - I was showing off. For Freddy Thistlewaite. Oh lord he was handsome. And he didn't know or care that I was alive. Even after I broke my arm for him. - Some boys are like that. - Yeah, but not all of 'em. - Well sure, Dad's not like that at all. You sure were lucky to find him. [laughing] Sluts. - Dorothy. - Mom, they're laughing at me. - Why would they do that? - They were at that party, they thought it was funny. - Well just be a lady and ignore them. - Mom we've to get one thing straight. I'm not a lady. Maybe one day I might grow up to be one, but right now I'm 13 and I'm really mad and if I don't do something about it I'm liable to explode. - Well what do you have in mind? - Revenge. - You mean like this? - Sluts, trollops, loose women. You better watch out when you're around me you creeps. I'll fight you once and for all. Don't mess around with me, cause I'm dangerous. - You dirt balls. Low riders. Scuzz bunnies. - Mother, where did you ever learn such language? - I was 13 too. - Sometimes I get the feeling like being 13 is like a fatal disease. Will I ever live through it? - Well don't worry about getting through it. Just live it. I know I haven't been very good at showing you but, I do know what it's like, and I love you. - [Grandpa] Okay everyone, here goes. - [Michael] All right, come on Grandpa. [cheering and yelling] - [Dorothy] Let's eat, I'm starved. - Spencer I'll need you to kill the goose this evening. I want her first thing in the morning, ready to be stuffed. - [Spencer] All right. - [Janet] I'm really looking forward to that Christmas Eve service at church tonight. - [Amanda] Well we all are. - [Dorothy] Not Michael and me. - [Minerva] Well why not? It's a tradition. - [Dorothy] Michael and I found a better way to celebrate Christmas. Didn't we? - I guess. - [Dorothy] You'll love it Mom It's a surprise. You'll get a big bang out of it. [laughter] - May I be excused please? - What's the matter honey? Don't you feel well? - I feel awful. - Oh. Well. You go upstairs and lie down I'll come up and see you in a little while. - [Spencer] What's the matter with him? - [Dorothy] I don't know. [loud overlapping conversation] Brunhilda. Brunhilda. - Good girl. C'mon. Stay. Good girl. I know where there's this old empty barn and you're gonna stay there. And after Christmas is over I'll come back for you. And you'll be safe again for another year. [goose honking] No Brunhilda. Wait! Stop Brunhilda. No wait! [crashing] Ahh! Help! Help! - Sorry Brunhilda. It's a hard fact of life on the farm. [geese quietly honking] - Oh didn't take long. Where's the goose? - That's what I'd like to know. - Oh I've been fattening that bird for a whole year, don't tell me she decided to fly to Florida for the holidays. - I think I'll have a little talk with my grandson. - Well he's supposed to be upstairs in the children's room. Janet went up to check on him. - Where's Michael? - He's probably in the bathroom. I haven't seen him. - Well I just passed the bathroom, he's not in there. - [Grandpa] Michael? - He's not up here Grandpa. - What do you want him for? - I suspect he's run off with the Christmas goose. - Oh Michael. - Hannibal? Hannibal we've got a missing child out here. Could you take a look around down there and see if there's any sign of him? At the bus stop maybe. He might have a goose under his arm. Well thank you. - Did Mike give you any idea what his plans were? - No, but he sure is crazy about that goose. - Well he can't have gone far. I'll find him. - I'll go with you. - Now, I'll catch up with him sooner if I'm alone. Now don't worry I'll have that rascal home in no time. - I suppose I could have asked him to kill me another goose. but I just didn't have the heart. I'm going to go down to the cellar and see if I can find a ham to bake. - Michael. Michael. [goose honking] - Any luck? - No. I looked in the attic, he's not there. I'm going to look for him. - Oh I wish I'd realized how much that goose meant to Michael. I forgot that city bred kids aren't used to the way we do things out here in the country. - He, uh, he might have got out on the mill pond somehow. There's a hole in the ice. Janet wait until we get some help. - I gotta go find him Dad! [foreboding music] - What can we do? - Pray. [clicking phone] - Janet I'll take you home. - No. Not... not til I find him. - I heard about Mike. I'm sorry Dorothy. - He's not dead. I just know it. He's not dead. - They're going ahead with the Christmas service. - Mealy mouth hypocrites. How can they celebrate Christmas at a time like this? - It's not a celebration. My grandfather said it was an offering to God, to ask him to help bring Mike home. - He's not dead. He's lost and I'm going to send out a signal to help him. - Can I help? - You sure can. Help me haul out the firecrackers he buried. - Neat. Let's set off arocket first. [match striking] - This one's for you Michael. Hear it and follow it home. [rocket fizzes and bursts] ♪ Silent night, Holy night ♪ All is calm, all is bright ♪ Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child [firecracker explosion] ♪ Holy infant ♪ So tender and mild ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace [firecracker explosion] ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace. - Michael! Michael where are you? Michael. Michael. - We're all out of fireworks Dorothy. - If Mike hasn't heard us by now, he's not going to. - Michael. Michael. Mic... oh... [sobbing] Neil. Neil. [barking] Can't find him anywhere. Mother? - Yes dear? - You're dead aren't you? - Yes Janet. I was so touched by the way you stayed behind after my funeral. It's a wonder you didn't catch your death of cold. - Father's dead too. And Aunt Min. This is a dream. - Oh yes it's a dream all right. But we're the authors of our own dreams. And we can make happen whatever we want to happen. - It's good to have you home again Janet. - You were the one I always felt sad about Aunt Min. It was a way you had of standing at the window and looking out. Always waiting for someone. - Don't be sad for me. He comes. I'm a grown woman now. I have a family. Home of my own. - We're proud of you Janet. - But I'm losing them Dad. Somewhere along the line I've, I've lost my marriage. - Then you must find it. - Where do I look? - First look inside yourself. That's the secret, you always wanted us to tell you about. - The secret place. - The secret place is inside you. Within you. - I've never been able to find it. - Sometimes you have to reach down deeper inside yourself than you've ever been. You have to find a faith that's greater than anything you could possibly imagine. You'll find the strength that's in all of us. If only we have the grit and the guts to discover it. It's in you. It's in each of us. - Neil. Oh Neil. Neil I'm so glad you're here. - I heard your voice, I knew you needed me. - Michael's disappeared, we can't find him anywhere. - We'll find him. - But... but he's been gone for hours. - I know, but we'll find him. - I want to tell you something. I love you. - I love you too. - Oh we haven't said that in so long. - So many times I wanted to tell you how much I loved you, how much I needed you. - I've wanted to call you back as you were leaving the house, just to touch you, feel you. Something to hold onto until we could be alone again at night. - How did we lose that? - Maybe we just didn't realize what a lovely thing we had. We drifted away from being young and all that passion. Somewhere along the way we lost each other. - We are getting older Janet. - Is that so bad? - No. I don't think that's bad at all. In fact, I think it's wonderful that we've come this far. I love you Janet. I remember something your mother once said. "In the presence of love there are miracles". [moaning] [moaning] - Oh Mike... - Mom what's the matter? - Well... You've been gone all night. I thought I'd lost you. I thought I'd never see you again. - Now I remember. I fell through the ice. I thought I was gonna die. I was really scared. But I'm all right. I'm fine. - Oh you are so fine and I love you so much. - I love you too Mom. But what's the matter? - Well uh... how did you get here? - The whole time I was lost I heard sounds like somebody shooting off firecrackers. - Oh that was your sister trying to help you find your way home. - Sorry I worried you all, but I guess saving Brunhilda was my job. - Well you're a very brave young man and I am very proud of you. - Could we go home now? - MmHm. Yes. We can go home now. Neil. - Where've you been? You slept all night and all day too. How do you feel? - I don't know. All right I guess. - Can I... can I get you something? - No just hold me. - You seemed so far away. I was afraid I'd never see you again. - There's a place we're going to build together. A secret place. For just the two of us. - Janet we've lost so much. There's no money. There's nothing. - We have everything. We have each other. We have love. We have children. Merry Christmas. - Oh Mamma. - Are you all right? - Are you okay? - Mom should you be out of bed? - I'm much better Dorothy. - You slept the longest kind of time. - Well it was just what I needed. - We were sure worried about you, Mom. - Thank you darling, but I'm fine now and it's Christmas Eve. And in a few days it'll be a brand new year. And look at what you've done! It's beautiful. - We put it all on ourselves. - We put up all the ornaments by ourselves. - We decorated all by ourselves. - Time for that. - All right. Here we go. - Ok! - Put on the star Daddy. - Ok. - How's that? Huh. - Ah lovely. - O that's great yeah. - Hey it's the carolers. - Invite them in.
