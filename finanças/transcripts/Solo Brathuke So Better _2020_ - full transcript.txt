Generations are changing. Girl Child is scaling heights. From cooking in the kitchen... to getting worldwide honor, she is grown so much. But when faced with the claws of a a few cruel men. She often becomes the victim. So, let's save Girl Child and save womanhood. Remember. Their safety is our responsibility. We want... Justice! We want... Justice! We want... Justice! Who is this guy?

Virat is coming! Virat is coming! Virat is coming! Virat is coming! Virat! Virat! Virat! Anger, Affection, Sorrow, Joy, Happiness and Sadness... These are all emotions that change with time and reason. Similarly, love is also an emotion. What is the guarantee that it will not change? No. No. No. No. I do not ask for my moms permission to do anything or go anywhere. But when in a committed relationship, you are expected to do that. What the hell, guys! I mean, seriously? I bloody condemn it. I condemn it. We all condemn it. Looking at you guys, I remember a saying. It goes, Behind every successful man, there is a woman. Girls, it is definitely true when you reverse the roles. Likewise, for every unsuccessful man, there is a woman behind him. The point to be noted is. There are more unsuccessful men in our country than successful ones. Yes! Yes! Our Constitution gave us fundamental rights to live freely. But we're ruining them in the name of committed relationships. We are losing our damn right. Yes! Yes! Yes! When you get into a committed relationship. It is a one-way ticket for them to hurt you. It is a fact. You must be thinking. I have a sad love story. I must’ve had a bad break up. But, that is not the case. My dear brothers and sisters. It is the teachings of these legends. If you still do not get why I am against relationships. I have compiled 108 of my best learnings into this book. This is not just a book. My dear brothers and sisters, this is our life. What’s our goal? No love! No love! What is our agenda? Freedom! Freedom! Finally, what is our slogan? Solo life is so better! Solo life is so better! Everybody, listen up! Just be solo. Say it again. Solo life is so better. Everybody, listen up! Just be solo. Say it again. Solo life is so better. Say it aloud, bachelor. Solo life is so better. Do not get tangled in this drama No one can get you out of it You will keep drowning, dear. Love is a path filled with thorns. Why do not you trust me! Do not just walk blindly, It is so dangerous. Say it aloud bachelor. Solo life is so better. Say it aloud bachelor. Solo life is so better. We are all on a spiritual path. These relations will not fetch us anything. All the elderly people know this harsh truth But they keep lying to us. Solo life is so better. Listen to me bachelor. Say it aloud bachelor. Solo life is so better. Say it aloud bachelor. Solo life is so better. Boys and Girls. Everybody listen. Just be solo. Say it again. Solo life is so better. Everybody listen. Just be solo. Say it again. Solo life is so better. What is this, dear? You have bought all rotten vegetables. You should have double checked, right? How do you expect me to cook these? And, how many times do I have to tell you? And, how many times do I have to tell you? Mom, you could have left the world smoothly. But you had to rip me of my sanity by marrying me to her. You are happy, right? You must be having fun up there. Uncle, I have motivated the youth greatly with your inspiration. You are amazing, man. You cannot handle things at home. But you are giving out crappy advice. What? She is still home? Did not she go out? At least you get some sense into your brain. Because I have been a fool, I am cautioning him. Well, this is an everyday scene. By the way, are they here? Yes, uncle. Let us go. I insisted that he does not marry. But he did not give a damn. He was so cool back then. Young and charming. Ever since he got married, he’s become stagnant. Uncle, what about Rajesh? Rajesh lived like a King. He gave up, you know. I mean, he got married and lost all his confidence. Destroyed! He did not listen to anybody. Got depressed. Hey. Why did not you tell me? Why did not you look? What the hell! You know that is not happening. We should definitely capture this moment. We should definitely capture this moment. He thinks he is a pro cinematographer. Half his pictures are out of focus. He is the reason my passport application got rejected. Today is the last day, bro. I will never drink again. Hey! What is this? Please. Please. It comes only once a year. Please. Okay. Go ahead. Happy birthday! Hello. Happy birthday, Love. Thanks, Mom. Dad wants to talk. Talk to you later, mom. Bye. Virat Happy birthday! Why did you cut my call when I was wishing you? According to poem no. 36, we should keep our family emotions under control. Otherwise, we will see a downfall in life. The last 4 years have been amazing, huh? Everything from the past seems amazing. You are coming to the farewell tomorrow, right? Definitely. Thanks to my fellow students and faculty. I am just leaving the college. Our ideology is going to remain the same. If so I get married in the future. That is the day we have truly parted ways. Solo life is So better! That is good. What is next for you, bro? Why do you want to know? Why? What are you going to do, bro? When Dharma Raju goes to the jungle? Pandavas do not go to Australia, do they? We will go wherever he goes. Virat Hmm? I need to talk to you. Tell me. Not here. It needs to be in private. Do not stretch it. Come to the point. I have a party to attend. I have a party to attend. Umm. I love you. Are you out of your mind? What did you just say? What the hell is wrong with you? I have known you all these years. Your company, your style, the way you talk. I really like you. That is why I feel like I want you, all to myself. Just because the ventilation is good. you do not claim a rented house as your own, do you? Same theory applies to me as well. I am not going to say I will think about it. It is all crap, okay? But I have a good offer for you. Because you say you are hot for me. I mean, in your words, love. I will give you the directions to my friends place. Let us create good memories tonight. Let us go? What do you say? I said I love you and you rejected me. In the future, in case you do not find love when you most need it. That is when you will realize my pain. Happy farewell, darling! Bro, she is Miss Vizag. 10 guys have been after her from our college itself. She proposed so cutely and you still rejected her? Listen. Sometimes, God tests us to see if we will stick to our principles. Come on. Let us celebrate. Hey! You better do not bring that camera to Hyderabad. What are these for? Remove them. Hey! Hey! You are never home when you are here in Vizag. Now you are going all the way to Hyderabad. Stay in touch on phone, okay? Mom, no lectures before leaving. Shall I drop you at the station? No need. My friends are coming. Let me know if you need money. No, thanks. I got a job in an event management company. He did not tell me either. Really? Why did not you tell me? What is there to tell? So, you are going to remain solo even there? Mom, I am running late. I have to meet Venu uncle on the way. Bye. Bye. Murali, did you guys start? Yeah. Uncle Uncle Hmm? I am leaving. What? You are leaving today? Hmm. Did you plan everything? All set, uncle. I will work in an event management company for a few years. Start my own company soon. And enjoy the rest of my solo life. You are just amazing! Want to have some coffee? No, auntie. Ask him to take his pill after coffee. We do not want his blood pressure rising again. When did it rise by the way? We had a huge fight because I came home drunk last night. You know that Smoking and Drinking is injurious to health disclaimer before a movie. You know that Smoking and Drinking is injurious to health disclaimer before a movie. Someone should pass a disclaimer saying Marriage and wives are injurious to health. Sounds nice, uncle. I will put it in my book. Go ahead. One more thing. My friend Mohan lives there. You can go to him in case you need anything. He will help you out. Hmm. Hyderabad! What a city! Hey, Sandeep. Put the camera aside and move that couch. No one comes near the kitchen, okay? No one will even try, bro. You are our official cook. Why did you put the bag on crockery? Hey! Decrease the volume. Where is the Vajpayee photograph? It should be there. Check. Look where the fridge is. What is with you guys? Hold on a minute. I will set up everything and then arrange it. How can I do everything by myself, bro? Hey, you are from Vizag, right? Yes. How do you know? It is the way you end every sentence with a bro. Good observation. Did you settle in? I am from near Anakapalli. Oh. Can you cook? No. Find me if you need anything. I live one floor under you. He does not let me talk. And this is my husband. Hello. If you want anything, please ask me. Okay. Okay. Do not feel shy. We belong to the same place. We must help each other out. We will come find you in case we need anything. Let me arrange it. I can do it. -It is okay. Please go. Do not come through the window again. -Okay. Let me know if you need anything. Bro, we are making chicken fry tonight. Do not strain yourself. Hi, guys. My name is Virat. I am from Vizag. Did you have to make such a loud sound to say that? The sound was not about introducing myself. It is about something else. What is it, bro? I do not like the way you guys work. Is it so? Tell us how to work then. I am not going to pass statements like Work is Worship. You should love what you are doing. Or just go home. Finally, my point is, we should enjoy our work. Not let it burden us. So, what I am trying to say is, romance your job. Whoa! Well said, bro. Come on. Clap for him, guys. Hey! Do not! What were you lecturing about? How to romance work, maam. Over smart, huh Thank you, maam. Welcome to the company. I do not belong to anyone. I have a world of my own. And that’s my music. Bro, you did not hit nails into the walls, did you? Someones doing it. Is it your dad? Vajpayee? Abdul Kalam? Hello, bro. Who are you? I am the owners ma. I know you are a man. Who said any different? Hey! I was going to say I am the owners son. Uff! My name is Govinda Gouda. Bro, you need to pay the rent on time. I mean, we have got EMIs to pay. Your maam told us everything. Of course, she did. One more thing. You should definitely attend my wedding. Why did you all turn around at once like a gang of psycho killers? He is the only guy out of sync. I was just kidding. You have got owls eyes. Just for fun. I need to talk to you, bro. Come to the point. Why, bro? What do you mean? Marriage! Marriage. It is a good thing, bro. Really fun! We are partying with colleagues in the evening. You drink, right? Bro, I am a pro. When you are through with your second peg and your wife calls to keep tabs. You will definitely get frustrated and I guarantee you that. Would it still it be fun then? Why would I be frustrated, bro? Would not I be happy? And I would not be with colleagues at this time anyway. If I go home, that is where the real fun is. Why does not he get it? Let me put this out loud and clear. He who gets fooled on April 1st, despite knowing it’s Fool’s Day. And he who gets married, despite knowing that he had be fooled every day. They had never find happiness in their life. You guys passed out in 2012. But I passed out in 2002. Awarded Best Employee for 10 years. Let me also put this out loud and clear. It is pretty hard to stop a hunter on his chase and a player in form. Just as hard it is to stop a young lad like me from getting married. Like really, really, really hard! Got it? Hey, psycho killers gang! Attend the wedding if you wish. If you do not, just have the food and leave. As you wish. It’s my wedding. My wish. Govind Gouda! In Gods name! Bro, we are anyway. Let us eat something and go. Items are really delicious. Want to have dessert? You hog! -Sure. Hey! Who is that having dinner without permission? It is 300 rupees per plate. Hey! It is the psycho killers gang. I invited you guys as a formality. You really showed up! You guys are eating first anyway. Do not spread hate talk, okay? Meghana, please do it as I say. Do not ask me so many questions, man. Why is he acting all fancy? Work from home, is it? He is your event organizer. Your first event! Fashion show? No. Music concert? No. Marriage event. I will not do it, maam. You have to do it! We had an agreement. Okay, maam. This must be the twist of the century. You lectured me about how marriage sucks. Now you have more stuff to do here than the priest. Now you have more stuff to do here than the priest. You get it? We need someone to help you ruin your life, right? What did he just say? He told you about the future. But the present is more important to me. Hey, cameraman! Why are you focusing on the bride-grooms friend? Hey, cameraman! Why are you focusing on the bride-grooms friend? The groom is here. Do not make me knock you down. Who hired this idiot? Do not spread hate talk after eating, okay? Get lost! Speed up the flower decoration. Quick. Quick. We are running late. I feel sorry for you. I would not wish this upon your worst enemy. Tough task, man. Like really, really, really tough. Govind Govind Yes, dad? Wedding has been called off. What? Wedding has been called off? Dad, stop joking at this point in time. I do not like it. I am not joking, son. The wedding has been called off for real. Why? They were the ones to call it off. You can not find a better way out, I am telling you. Govind, let us not fight. Wedding has been called off. Be happy. No, this is not done. It is just a strategic timeout. I will convince them. Hey, I heard you called off the wedding. You think this is a joke? By the way, where’s the bride, bro? She is blushing. Maybe it is her. You fool! Look here. You told me she looks smoking hot. That is what is making me upset. Girls look horrible without makeup. It is a fact. But this girl looks horrible even with makeup. Imagine my wrath. Look at her! I offered to give her a new life because I have a big heart. But she says she does not like me. Hey, you! What is the problem? Bro. What is the problem? Hey! Careful. What did you say your age was when we first met? Some digit between 25-30. Do not give me the age on your 10th grade certificate. I want to know the original date. 38 running. 37 years passed. A 37 year old guy like you wants to marry a 23 year old beautiful girl like me? Did you seriously call yourself beautiful? Hey, you! Uncle, forgive me. You fooled us about your age to marry my little girl. How dare you! Uncle, cool down. Age gap is quite common. Sachin and his wife were born 5 years apart, you know that? 5 years? They have 2 kids. Really? Govind, I have a small doubt. 5 years gap can be overlooked. But this seems like a generation gap. I will look after her like a father would. Who the hell am I then? You are the step-father. Get out of my sight. I am trying to convince them, right? Go look after the event. Uncle, what is your problem? You are the problem. Come on! I am 6 feet tall. I got it. You go. I will talk. What are you saying now? Wedding is cancelled. Hold on a minute. You do not have to do it. We are only calling off the wedding. Who the hell said that? Who the heck are you? She is my girl. Wedding is cancelled. Get out of here. Govind, I would not wish this upon my worst enemy. It is like really, really, really bad. Thanks for telling us about his age. Whatever. You fool! What did you tell him? You fool! What did you tell him? Admit it. Govind is a lucky fellow. You know what I think? That girl is the lucky one. Why? Do not you see it? He passed out in 2002. Been the Best Employee for 10 years. Owns a lavish apartment. And is a single child. Do not call her lucky. I elevated his character by mentioning the 10 years Best Employee thing. It is not elevation. It is a revelation. I should not have shared my background story with you guys. I should just hit myself with a sandal. Shoe would be better, bro. He is also throwing punch lines at me. Yellappa, get me drinks, please. It is okay if there is no water. I will just fetch some from the swimming pool and crash. I will just fetch some from the swimming pool and crash. Govind, why are you so worked up? You gave her the consent to hurt you for a lifetime. You gave her the consent to hurt you for a lifetime. What did she do? She hurt you for a day and left you. You should be happy. Bro, that is one torturous philosophy. I do not get it. Say no to marriage Do not commit this mistake Say no to marriage Do not commit this mistake You cannot bear the torture after marriage Great poet Vamana has already said this I wish this punishment is not imposed on my enemies also I wish this punishment is not imposed on my enemies also Marriage is torture Marriage is a heavy baggage which you can not carry, my brother. Marriage is a heavy baggage which you can not carry, my brother. This is a big ocean and you will drown in it. Marriage is all the following. Torture, Fracture, Puncture, Rupture Be careful, my brother. Say no to marriage Do not commit this mistake Say no to marriage Do not commit this mistake Bro, it is my sisters birthday.

You Got to Make It Work And See It Shine, Life looks colourful if a girl is with you? It is so cheerful All your freedom will be lost Your kingdom will collapse Why should your life stop at a dead end? All the life lies in the weekend Do not disturb your space, pace and peace. Do not run towards the oasis in the desert Marriage is as poisonous as a snake, and you can not win this game. Be careful, my dear brother. Say no to marriage Do not commit this mistake Say no to marriage Do not commit this mistake Happy Good boy! What is up, Murali? Why are you pacing? Bro, I need to talk to you. Tell me. The thing is. Come to the point already. My family fixed my marriage. Tell them you are not interested. Grandma is in a critical condition. She wants to witness my wedding before she passes. So, my family is pressurizing me to get married. What the hell! We wanted to spend the rest of our lives without any inhibitions. Why are you doing this now? You cannot get married just because your grandmas health is worsening. To be honest, I also want to get married, dude. We can not be solo for life, right? Bro Bro. What? You want to get married? And you are making excuses that someone in your familys dying. You said you had follow me wherever I go. All the way to Australia even. You were messing with me, huh? Come on. Come on. Bugger off! Bro, hear me out. You are a cheater. Get lost, you idiot! Happy! Good boy. Hey, Smart Chef! Why are you pacing? Are you also getting married? Yes, dude. You guessed it right. I will knock you down, idiot! Are you guys possessed or something? Each one of you is getting married. Just kidding, bro. Hey! Where are you going? Want me to send packing? I was just kidding. Just for fun. You were kidding, huh? Just for fun? What? Did someone bring up marriage? Hell, no! Sure? Yeah. How long since you read the book? It is been 5 years, bro. -So long, huh? Mug it up tonight and recite it to me tomorrow. Okay? Good night, bro. Ah! What about you? Do you also plan on getting married? I just read the book, bro. Very good. Pour the beer. Okay. Hey, Chaitu! Did you read the book? Did you mug up all the poems? If you say the word ‘Marriage one more time. He also left? He did. What? Did he leave? His clothes aren’t here. I am sure he left through the window. Oh, really? I didn’t know. Hey! If you have any such ideas, warn me in advance. I will prepare myself. You think I am like those idiots? Do not have any doubts about me. I told you I will be with you forever. Come. Let us go. He is not going. Sandeep Sandeep Sorry, bro. My marriage is also fixed. I should have known when you said you are not like them. At least they gave me a heads up. You did not even do that. You are a cheater! I thought only love and marriage could hurt us. You guys have taught me that friends are no exception. I am the Founder of the Union Solo Life Is So Better. I do not need any of you. Challenge! Uncle. What is up? The three other guys who were with me, just left. Did they leave? Of course, they did. Of course, they did. I have always been skeptical about Murali. He was the first one to leave. Dear ! What? You promised to take me to the hospital today. Remember? I will. I am on the phone with Virat. Whoa! Do not worry. Karma will come full circle. You are right, uncle. They will pay for this. You are good, right? Of course, uncle. I am doing great. I am glad. Okay, uncle. Bye. Virat Solo Life Is So Better. Cheers! Come on. Come on. Girlfriend! Hey, Happy! Happy! You traitor! Come on, not you too! Come on. Come on. Hey! Get lost! Look. I am going to marry you only. I have made my decision. You should do too. Call me back. What is up, bro? I do not see you around anymore. It is your poor sight because of your age. Whoa! Cracking jokes on me, huh? Easy! After your psycho killers gang left, your energy kind of came down. So did your electricity and water bill. Like really. Happy? It is been my nature since I was a kid. Hey! Murthy bro interview is airing. You do not save up to buy a house and properties anymore. Trust me. There is no almarah at my place. So, that is that. You are amazing. Be free. Be happy. That is it. That is it. But, what I really believe is. Everyone should get married. Murthy bro. What are you saying? You should get married at the supposed age. Abide by the Law of Nature. Law of Nature? Hey! Do not say another word. I now regret not getting married. Murthy bro! Is it really you talking? When I looked outside my window one day. I noticed two birds flying. Birds? Two birds, two snakes and two pigs are making a home for themselves. What the hell, Murthy bro! I am saying it as a friend to the future generations. Youth of today, do not avoid marriage to achieve your goals. Get married at the right time and have a bunch of kids. Stay happy. All the best. All the best? Is marriage really important? Damn! Why did Murthy bro say that? Usually, he would not have said that. He must have gone wrong somewhere. Two pigs, two wild animals and two birds. Everything is. Okay. Focus. Okay. Get married, brother. Murthy bro! Your coffee, sir. Not here. No. Two birds! Two snakes! Not again! I have to get out of here. Right now. Oh, my god! Come on, Virat! Come on! Yes! Yeah! Murali, super! Virat, you are a single man show. You are just amazing! Hey Happy! Where are you? Hey Happy! Where are you? How are you son? Have it. It is a festive day. Here. No. No. I am like your mother. Have it. Ah! Water. Hey! I will not ask for it. Gray hair? I have grays. Uncle Uncle Drop me at school, please. Who is he calling? I am talking to you, uncle. Uncle! Please, uncle! Uncle! Do not call me Uncle, kid! Uncle! Who are you calling uncle, huh? You. Do I look like an uncle to you? Yes. Call me Bro. Call me Bro. Bro, I will never call you Uncle again. I will crush you if you call me Uncle again. Get out! Uncle, my foot! Fatty! Bye, uncle. See you, uncle. Mommy, uncle is beating me. You are so done for, kid! What is uncle doing here? He did not even give me a call. Uncle! Hold on. I'm coming. Hey! Come. Come. When did you arrive in Bangalore? I had some work with Mohan. So I came this morning. You arrived this morning and did not bother to call me. Whoa! You have changed a lot. No, I did not. I just forgot to call. You must have fought with aunt. It is okay to forget. It is been 4 months since your aunt passed away. Uncle! Are you alright? No, I am not. When she was with me. I took her for granted and fought with her all the time. I have realized her value once she was gone. Whom do I fight with now? There is nobody to talk to when I get home. I thought my mom forced her into my life before leaving the world. But it was only after your aunt passed away. That I realized my mom made my wife take her place. We are of the assumption that the whole world is ours, excluding them. But they believe that we mean the world to them. We are so blind to their love all the time. Women are intelligent beings with a good heart. They find out what we need and do it for us in advance. And when they are gone. They make us realize how much we need them. It is over. I will leave. It is time. Bye. Hey! When you said Solo Life Is So Better. I also encouraged you. Sorry, man. That is not true. Because sometimes to wipe our tears. Even both the hands do not seem to be enough. Trust me. Think about it. Hello, mom. Tell me. Why did not you tell me Sudha auntie passed away? I tried calling you many times. But you cut my calls. I was going to tell you later. But Venu uncle told me not to. He did not want to disturb you for no reason. Okay, mom. Bye. Hello, bro. Hey, Virat! Tell me, bro. Guys, come to my flat this weekend urgently. We have been waiting for your call, dude. We will be there. Bro Tell me. Thanks for forgiving me and making this call, man. Happy! Go and play. What do you guys do? Nothing much. I am managing our gold shop in Vizag. My wife is managing me and our kid. It is all good. You know Infosys company, right? In the next lane. Hey! Is it the same job your uncle offered you? I will simplify it. Generally, people settle down and get married. But this guy got married and then settled down. Stop it! You will get the first prize for being a party pooper. It is true though. What about you? I own a fashion studio. He clicks pictures of hot chicks. Man, I am a fashion photographer. Stop it, guys! What about your own event management company? It is set up. Then why are you sounding so dull? I met Venu uncle unexpectedly. It is been many days since Sudha auntie passed. He is someone who loves me dearly. Still, he chose not to share his pain with me. Made me realize how far I have come from him. My parents must have gone through so much pain when it came to me. I realize that now. We are pretty strong until a certain age. We assume that we have a lot of time to enjoy our life. That is what I exactly felt too. Generally, we differentiate life as teenage, middle age and old age. But there is an age nobody is aware of. It is the age where you shift from 29 to 30. That is when you go bald, get a tummy and gray hair. If there are so many physical changes. Just imagine the amount of pressure mentally. Our friends, who were with us till then. They go separate ways. No, bro. At that time. Come on! I do not mean you guys. I am just saying it casually. The philosophy I believed in sounds good on paper. or to makes memes on social media. But practically, life is a much bigger deal than what I presumed. So, I have decided to get married. Whoa! We have been dying to hear that. Now we need to find you a partner. Leave it to us. We will get it done. There are so many girls in our class. One of them must be available. Hey, Priyanka! How are you? What is the matter? You know Virat, right? He is young and energetic. He just confessed that he wants to get married. What do you say? I do not want to hear a thing about him. I will kill you! He is the villain in my love story. No, listen. Where is he right now? Share his location with me. But I do not have Whatsapp. Bye. Hello, Srujana. Virat wants to get married. What do you say? There are already 4 guys on my waiting list. If Virat is fine with it, he will be the 5th. No, thanks. Uh-huh. Guys, why are you going on a girl hunt for him? Bro, do you know who is the perfect match for you? It is Raasi. You guys are made for each other. She proposed so beautifully in college. She proposed so beautifully in college. Because you say you are hot for me. I mean, in your words, love. I will give you the directions to my place. Let us create good memories tonight. Let us go? If she remembers what I told her last time. She will screw my life. Stop it, man. Rajnikanth also insulted Ramya Krishna several times in Narasimha. Still, she remained unmarried for him. Same case with Raasi. She would wait for you. She would. She must. Okay. Find out where she lives now. She was crazy about him back then. She had definitely wait. Did you find her? Found her ID. Dude, her status says Single. Yes! She is still waiting for you, man. Did not I say you guys are meant for each other? Sometimes, we look everywhere but in our pockets. She is your girl, man. Why are you still hesitant? I told you she had wait for you. Come on. Hey, leave the engine on. We will elope with her if needed. Come on! You are Mr. Virat, right? Yeah. You are Mr. Virat, are not you? Yes. Sir, Mr. Virat is here! Mr. Virat has arrived! See? Even the house help knows you. She is waiting for you, man. Uncle Uncle! Virat! What a surprise, man! Come. I mean, great to see you! That is good. Come in. Love you, man. You know what? Raasi used to talk a lot about you. By the way, would you like to have tea or coffee? No, thanks. I am good. I had like to talk to Raasi. Yeah, sure. Why not? One second, love. One second. Hey, Raasi. You have a pleasant surprise. Talk to him. Hey, Virat. Damn! Hi. Hi, Raasi. Nice, man. I cannot believe you visited. I wish I was there. So, what is up? How are you? Tell me! Any good news? What is happening? Did you get married? Oh! Sorry. I forgot. You are Virat, the legendary leader of the movement Solo Life Is So Better. Why would you get married? Actually, Raasi My opinion on marriage has changed. What? Mommy -What are you saying? Be quiet. -It is about marriage actually. Mommy. I want to talk to my mommy. Sir, she wants to talk to her mother. Let her. Actually, he is Raasi's kid. We got her married after Engineering. She went to UK on business last week. He said all that crap about Rajnikanth and Ramya Krishna. He said something else as well. Not looking in your pockets. Well, pockets have holes sometimes. I will make a hole on your face now. Let it go, bro. We have got a lot of options. Just relax. We will sort it out. Stop it. Let us go. Here. Leave the engine on, my foot! I better find a girl for myself instead of depending on my silly friends. Okay. Right. Sending. Right. Sending. Yes! What kind of a twist is this? No worries. There are so many other girls. Oh, shit! It is tough. Hey! This one looks familiar. Nah! She is different. Madam. Why is she blushing so much? It's done. Damn! She is killing me with her glances. I need to get some clarity about this. I really need God right now. Excuse me, maam. -Yeah. Madam, you. Madam, you sent a request on my profile in the matrimonial site. It was by mistake, right? [in Telugu] No, Virat. I did it voluntarily. She speaks Telugu? I am learning Telugu also. What for? I have recently heard that. What did you hear? That you changed your opinion about marriage. So? My opinion about marriage has also changed. Hmm. Actually, I am pretty shy to say these things. My family will come and talk to you. Regarding? Our marriage. Marriage? Yeah. With you? Actually, you are supposed to ask me to marry your daughter. How could I marry you, madam? What are you talking, Virat? You are also getting gray hair. How is my single strand of gray hair equal to your million strands? No, Virat. Please think about it. How can you even ask me that? Man! All the couples you’ve separated. They are seeking revenge on you. It is called karma. You deserve this. Madam, do not feel bad. Please do not. I will find a super match for you. Trust me. Please stop getting ideas about me. Bye, madam. Madam, I will not forget. I will find you a super match. See you, maam. Bye. Oh, my god! Bro! Listen up, bro! I am getting married, yo! You are invited, bro! Bros come first, yo! Hey, Govind! What’s happening? My wedding got fixed. Whoa! Congratulations! So you are finally getting married. So you are finally getting married. Bro! You should come to the wedding. I am not in the mood, Govind. Why should you be in the mood for my wedding? Oh! Is that what you understood? I do not have the patience, Govind. Why do not you just go ahead with it? Gather patience, bro. Want to know why? You have seen me get rejected by a girl. Now I want you to see me get married to a super-hot girl. Then I can live in peace. Do not go about seeking revenge at this time. Get married happily. No, bro! You should come and watch my wedding. I did not ask you to do any of the work there, did I? I just want you to be my guest. And you have a problem with that also. You should attend my wedding. That is it. You know you give me a hard time. Like really, really hard time, Govind. You go ahead. I will get ready and join you. Listen up, bro! Come downstairs, yo! I will wait for you, bro. It is my nuptial night, bro. I am damn happy, bro. Like really, really happy, bro. Uff! Come fast. We have not got much time. I am telling you before itself. You cannot criticize the food at the buffet. You should adjust. And go find dad. He must be meeting some auntie sneakily. Let’s go? Bro! What is that? It is the breath of a wounded lion. How does it sound? By the way, why are we taking a bus? Come on, bro! Wedding is in a small village near Vizag. Location is really, really, really grand. Hey! You said it like it is Miyapur or Dilsukhnagar. I am not coming. You go. Bro! Ugh! What? If you do not come, you will never get married. This is my curse. What the hell, man! I will go put clothes on. Go. Bro. What now? Get lost! Come fast. Quick. Quick. Do not walk like you are on the ramp. I might turn into a skeleton right here. Come fast. Priest, it is the Lord Ganeshs prayer next, right? Lord Ganeshs prayer. Hello. You missed 2 chants. I have watched the movie Srinivasa Kalyanam 3 times. You cannot miss the chants. Read properly. Stop! Bro! Hey! You should watch Lord Ganeshs prayer. That is why I invited you. Watch. Watch. You carry on. Where are you from? Vizag, sir. Are you married? No, sir. We are looking for alliances for my brothers daughter. Sir! Give me your number. Sure. We will talk after the wedding. Okay. Bring the bride. Bring her quickly. Bro! Do not look there. Look here. Watch. Watch. Girl is smoking hot. You are being such a sadist. I gave a missed call to your number. -Okay. It is time. Tie the holy thread. Finally! Give it to me. Lift her braid up. Whoa! Bro can not see her this way. I should make sure he sees it. I do not want this wedding. I am used to this crap. First let me tie the holy thread. Stop. Come on! Dad, I do not want this wedding. What do you mean? I spoke to you before doing any of this. You cannot say that now. I did not have clarity till now. But now I do. What is that? I am in love. You should have told us earlier. Is this the place and time to do it? I almost tied the holy thread. Dad, I am telling you. I do not want this wedding. I do not want this wedding. I am in love. Priest, hold this and stay here. Wedding is not called off yet. You said you are in love. Who is the guy? Tell me! Who is the guy? I said, who is the guy? Son, the bride says she wants to marry you. Why would she point at me? Come on! Yeah. She is pointing at you. You should come and watch my wedding. You should come and watch my wedding. I will not marry anybody but him. What is this, Amrutha? Dad, I already told you. I am not marrying anybody except him. No, listen. Mom, you do not interfere. You do not know anything about this. That is final, dad. I need to tell you something, man. Govinds wedding got cancelled. The bride chose me. She looked at me and said she will not marry anybody else. I swear, man. You should have been there. Call him back. What have you done, bro? What did I do, bro? You only said, Listen up, bro! I am getting married, yo! You are invited, bro! You should come and watch my wedding. You were going crazy. I cannot help it if she falls for me. I might not be powerful here. But I dare you to come to Hyderabad. I will talk to my mom and increase the rent by 15K. That is such a weird warning, man. Go. Go. Go on. You are supposed to attend a wedding bearing gifts. Not impress the bride and take her with you. How is it my fault that she is flattered by me? I knew it when I saw you guys. You are really a psycho killers gang. Govind, your life is ruined! This banner is equal to shit now. Man, your marriage got fixed because of me. You owe me. Get on the bus. Come on! I will show you what I am made of, once we get home. Excuse me. Mr. Venkata Ramana wants you at the wedding venue. Mr. Venkata Ramana wants you at the wedding venue. Coming. Hello. Please come. Sit. I thought the entire village will bless my daughter at the wedding and head home. But they headed home laughing at me mockingly. More than power and stature. My daughters happiness is more important to me now. I have had this feeling that maybe she does not want this wedding. When she pointed at you and said she had marry you. I felt shaken at first. But when I thought about it. I realized that if everything goes to plan. There is no point to the existence of God. Will you marry my daughter? Do not worry. It is my responsibility to protect your power and stature. Do not worry. It is my responsibility to protect your power and stature. Your daughter pointed at me and said I am the only guy she will ever marry. Your daughter pointed at me and said I am the only guy she will ever marry. It is destiny, sir. It is not in our hands really. You can talk to my parents and then fix the date. And if you do not mind, can I talk to your daughter once? Of course, you can. Go. Go. Thanks, sir. Krishna uncle, why did you leave the lights on? Pack up everything. Hi. Listen, it is all been pretty confusing since last night. You looked at me and immediately said that you love me. That you would not marry anybody but me. But, you do not even know me. Sir! Who says I do not know you? Sir? You are our God in disguise. What? God in disguise? And me? How? You should peek into my story if you want to know me. We went to my aunts place for the summer after 10th grade exams. Wow! Love is such a great feeling, right? Hey! Your brother Rahul is here. When did you come? Rahul had a love failure and attempted suicide. That’s when I thought. Whoa! Maybe love is not as mushy as in the movies. We had a lecturer called Sirisha. She was always smiling. She got married and then a month later. We saw her crying. Her husband was a psycho. He had torture her for something as petty as smiling and crying. That’s when I thought again. Whoa! So marriage isn’t such a mushy affair either. When I was in a dilemma whether to accept love and marriage. I heard a voice. We should badly condemn love and marriage. Yes! Yes! Yes! We get irritated to chop vegetables at home. But when we fail in love. We do not think twice to slit our wrists. Why do you want torture in your life, huh? No! We should strongly condemn love and marriage. Yes! Yes! Yes! You are my God in disguise, sir. Every poem of yours has changed my life. And then? Sir, you do not fancy the concept of love anyway. And you are strictly against marriage. Even God cannot convince you. My dad does not stand a chance. My dad does not stand a chance. So, I thought I could escape, using you as the bait. Escape, huh? Back then, you came into my life and gave me clarity. Now, you have come back into my life to show me a way out. You are just amazing, sir. He came back to save me. Sir, give me your number. 64. 64. Sir, I will call you as soon as I arrive in Vizag. Bye, sir. Thank you! Okay. Mom, what are you looking at? You never visit, despite my repeated calls. Now that you did out of the blue, looks like it’s going to rain. I am shocked. That is too much. Let us go inside. Hmm. Hey! What brings you home suddenly? Are you here on some work? I am here for a friend’s wedding. Hey! If there are any clothes outside, bring them in. It is definitely going to run. Go! A girl who believes in your philosophy, showed up in your life. On top of that, she used you to escape from the wedding, eh? That is what they call destiny. So, did you like the girl? I mean. I do, uncle. You are blushing. That is a first. Hello. Hello! It is me, sir. Amrutha. Yeah, tell me. I am also in Vizag. If you are free tomorrow, some of us friends are going out. If you could come with me. I am free. I will definitely join you. Okay, sir! Bye. Take care. Hey. Where are we going? Lankagramam, sir. It is nearby. Due to the recent storm. Fishermen lost their nets and boats. We collected funds and bought a few nets. Now we are going to distribute them. Nice. Where are you currently placed? I am working as a junior lecturer in our college. Oh! Very nice. Our college. I have a doubt. Tell me, sir. Because I was at the wedding. you pointed at me and got the wedding called off. What if I had not showed up? I would have gotten married, sir. What? What? Yes. I would have gone in for my nuptial night as well. I had decided to come out of the bedroom in 10 minutes? and declare that Govind is impotent. and declare that Govind is impotent. Govind. Is not that a great plan? Yeah. Yeah. Mind blowing plan. Mind blowing! God bless you, dear! What is this? What is this, huh? How could you get on with this without intimating me first? Even I have lost nets and boats. Give me 10 nets. 10? Ravan has 10 heads. Give me a net per each head. Who is he, bro? He is like bad omen in this village. He cannot take it when something is going well. Hope he drowns with the hurricane. Hey! Go get the money. Hey! Take your hands off. Respect women. Oi! Who the hell are you? Huh? Who are you? Why do you care, bro? I have been watching you, okay? You talk about Ravan and Lanka. Looks like you are well versed in the epics. Because I love Ravan. There is this small drama. Would you like to be a part of it? What drama? Suppose, just suppose. You are the Ravan of this Lanka. Yes. Yes. This is Goddess Sitas hermitage. You should enter like Ravan and kidnap Goddess Sita. You get everything there is here. Where is Sita, bro? He is Sita. Just take him, bro. Sita, what are you looking at? Go to your hermitage. Go fast. It is the epics. Let us go in order. You should cross the line drawn by Laxman to take Sita. Laxman Oh, Laxman. Bro! Come quickly and draw the line. Coming. Coming. Come. Come. Quick. Here goes the line, bro! It is not really the line drawn by Laxman. Cross it and get Sita. Go! Where are you going? Bro! Bro! Bro! Want to cross Laxmans line? Not so easy. Want to cross the line, is it? Try. Try. Try. Hey, bro! What’s going on? It is the line drawn by Laxman. It possesses powers. Be careful when you cross. Ravans soldiers are down. It is time for Ravan to enter the battlefield. Come on. Quick. Ravan will enter. No doubt about it. Why did you stop, bro? I get the part about the line drawn by Laxman. But, would not that contradict the course of the tale? What do you mean, bro? Sita crosses the line and Ravan kidnaps her. Ravan does not cross the line in the story. It is wrong. That is a good logic, bro. You are right. I know. Sita, cross the line and come forward. I am here for you. Do it. Cross it. Cross it. Sita crossed the line, dude! Bro! What are you doing? It is easy to kidnap Sita when Rama is not around. But when Rama is in the hermitage. You should know how it feels to kidnap Sita. Bro! Come on, Ravan. Come on. Leave me, bro. If he is Ravan, that makes you his soldier, eh? I know how to teach you a lesson. You call this Lanka and yourself Ravan, eh? I am going to rip your skin off. Bro, no! Bro, stop! Come on, Ravan. Come on! Ravan, my foot! He smacked us like hell, bro. When Rama is in the hermitage, you do not mess with Sita, guys. When Rama is in the hermitage, you do not mess with Sita, guys. Drive the chariot. Grandpa, here you go. After today, it feels like. If only Lord Rama was with Goddess Sita that day. Goddess Sita wouldn’t have to go through so much. Grandpa has great timing! Goddess Sita should always be beside Lord Rama. Goddess Sita should always be beside Lord Rama. This is the correct frame. Hey, is this me? Hey, is this real? I look new to myself This solo life is pushing me towards you after meeting you. Love has reached me this way. Bye, sir! -Bye. Strange. -Sir! You are just amazing, sir! Why do you say that? You knocked the shit out of them. Oh, that. You are always around, whenever I am in a tough situation. I swear. It feels great to have you by my side. Bye, sir! She has met me and brought sparkle in my eyes She sounded like a new music. She smiled like diamonds flooded the place. She shined like a full moon in the sea. The sky has turned into rainbow for me.

Okay. Okay. Okay. Calm down. In life, after a certain time, marriage becomes. Solo Life Is So Better! Solo Life Is So Better! What the hell! Please calm down. Please! Sir, Please, huh. Poem no. 48! Lovers look happy only when they are taking a selfie. Married couples look happy only for the wedding photographs. Rest of the time, they are sad as hell. We are confined to a coffin after death anyway. At least when we are alive, let’s live out of the box. Damn! They are not stopping. She is not stopping either. Solo! Solo! Solo! Solo! Finally, what is our slogan? Finally, what is our slogan? Solo Life Is So Better! Sir! I know you fumbled during the speech because you have not done this in so long. Actually, I prepared a different speech. Oh. But, you rocked! Thank you, sir. I never expected that a small initiative by me will grow into something as big. Sir, I have one more thing to tell you. One more thing? In 10 days, there is a huge college fest in Andhra University. We are talking about our philosophy in that fest. Just imagine, sir. There were only 500 members here. There, we will have 5000 members. Oh! 5000 members! Hmm. Very nice. Good spirit. Thank you, sir. I have your support, right? Of course, you do. Why not? Who is the Founder? You. Right. Who wrote that book? You again. I am that idiot. I mean, I am the writer. Of course. It is you! You will definitely have my full support. Do not worry. God bless you. -Thank you so much, sir! I have got something to take care of. I will see you later. Sure, sir. Sure. Bye. Bye, sir. Thank you so much, sir! Yes! Hello. Where are you? 100 meters away from a mental asylum. First tell me who you are. I am Amrutha father. Uncle Uncle Sorry. I do not have your number. Tell me. It is okay. What are you doing there anyway? I am visiting somebody I know. Priest wants to fix a date. Did you speak with your family? Before that, I need to talk to you. I am coming down to your place. Sure. Definitely. Come. Come. Wash your feet. Come on! Do it properly. Wash them. I will pour the water. It is okay. Wash them. Nice. Now come in. Come. Sit. Have it. No, thanks. Give me that towel. Go and take care of the lunch arrangements. Alright. Sit down. -You also sit down. Did you talk to your parents about the marriage? Please pay attention to what I’m about to say. That day at the wedding. Your daughter did not point at me so that she could marry me. She did it to completely avoid the concept of marriage. And the reason she has strongly decided against marriage is also. Me! Brother-in-law. Hey. What brings you here? My elder daughter is getting married. That is great news. What does the guy do? He works in Mahindra in Hyderabad. You brought good news. Lucky man! Go and tell this to your sister. Sister Sister My elder daughter is getting married. That is my brother-in-law. His daughter is getting married. I really like your daughter, sir. I have decided to marry her. Actually, I am here to tell you that. I promise you that I will change your daughter is opinion and marry her. Trust me. How can I? First, you were against love. Then you were against marriage. You preached the same to everybody. My daughter got influenced and said no to marriage. Even the huge Earth we live on, it rotates methodically. Process is the core of Nature. How can you deny that and make such decisions? How can you deny that and make such decisions? Even the Earth that rotates methodically. It has earthquakes sometimes. It takes time to adjust. Give us time, sir. I will leave. Bye. Have lunch and go. Hey, Chaitu. When did you come? This morning. Did you hear? My art has fans in Japan. They are going crazy with our stuff. Hey, Virat! Why are you late, bro? Come on. Enjoy the party. Come. Coming, bro. No one called you, bro. They did. Coming. Coming. I put him in an uncomfortable spot. And he asked me to have lunch before I go. Today, I witnessed a father’s joy, whose daughter was going to get married. Also a father is distress, who is worried that his daughter will not get married. I caused him that fear and anxiety. That is why I should end what I started. Otherwise, this guilt will haunt me forever. Why do not you just tell her, man? How can I? Do you know what she says when we meet? Sir, you are great. Sir, you are amazing. Sir, you are out of the world. When she says such stuff. What do you expect me to say in return? Alright. Suppose I tell her like you just asked me to. Suppose. What if she is not convinced? What then? She will not trust me ever again. She will not trust me ever again. I cannot take that risk, dude. I just cannot. What do you say we do now? That meeting can not happen, no matter what. The only way to do that is to change them. And the only way to change them is. I should make Amrutha turn off her brain and feel from her heart. Stop it, man! Now I get why Lord Hanuman’s statue is placed at the outskirts of the village. Why? Lord Hanuman is not married. So they put him near the border to guard the place. Oh. It is dads birthday. Drink quickly. My wife’s calling. Mom -Yes? Put daddy on the line, please. Dear It’s Virat. Hello, Virat. Hello, dad. The thing is. What? Happy birthday, dad. Are you drunk? Oh, my god! No! I just wanted to tell you and I did. Alright. Come home soon. Sure. Bye. What is gotten into him? He said birthday wishes and gave me a shocker. Everybody falls in love with my paintings. I will tell you the technique. You can go. He will explain the depth of the painting. Go. Hey, Virat! You should come to my art exhibition tomorrow. It is my best work. With this, FF Hussain will become MF Hussain. Wait and see. Hey! Did you prep FF Hussain properly? Bro, do not worry. I have got it under control. That is why I am worried. Hi, sir. Amrutha, you look ho. You look really beautiful in this saree. Thank you, sir. Where are we, sir? I told you about an important person in my life, right? We’re here to meet him. Okay. -Please. Hi, uncle. Come. This is my uncle Venu. Hi, uncle. Some of the poems from our philosophy came from him. Uncle, then you should definitely attend our Solo meeting. How come? He is a changed man now. He is changed? Yeah. Sudha auntie makes really good coffee. I am also not bad at it, okay? Sit down. Hey, did not you tell her yet? How could I? If I tell her that. You cannot imagine the terror that follows. Should I cover for you then? Please do not say anything. I am working it out from my end. Go make coffee. That is enough. You think so? Yes. I had a slip of tongue earlier. Pardon me, huh. Uncle, your coffee is just amazing. Thank you! Uncle, you also get ready. We will go together. Why me? You guys carry on. Come on, let us go. Hold on. She just said my coffee was good. Let her finish it. Do not rush her. Amrutha, listen. Yes, uncle? No vehicle runs properly without a minimum of 2 wheels. No vehicle runs properly without a minimum of 2 wheels. Ships and boats are doing just fine with zero wheels, uncle. Sir, that is poem no. 72, right? You are so sharp! Let us go? Bye, uncle. Bye dear. See that? Your uncle tried to tell me something. It is nothing really. Forget about it. Okay. Shit! Shit! Shit! He told me it’s an art exhibition. Mentioned nothing about the Titanic theme. Let us go back. Sir! Sir! We are here now. Let us take a look and leave. I am staying only because you want to. These are all my creations. Hey, idiot! Do not press whatever you want. They will be here any minute now. They are coming. Hold on. Come. Come. I will show you. Hey! Why did not you tell me the theme was Titanic? Amrutha left. Thank god! All set? All set, bro. Your plan will make Amrutha feel from her heart instead of the brain. Stop making stupid faces and turn on the music. This is where Jack and Rose have seen each other. For the first time. On the ship. See? Jack and Rose look crazy together. It’s an art by me! Well done, FF Hussain. Come. Come. I will show you one more masterpiece. This is where Jack and Rose loved each other. See the depth? Not the sea depth. See the depth of my heart. Oh, man! Do not you look at the ship. Please look at Jack and Roses relationship. That is the main thing. Come. Come. Come. This is where Jack and Rose made love. Hey, bald head. It is not a bold story. It is a great love story. Hey, young lady! Why are you so curious? Do you like this love story? This is not a love story. What do you mean? This is a Nature’s revenge story. Revenge? Whoa! How is that? Tell me. No, tell me. Listen. According to poem 62. Listen. According to poem 62. Poem? Sir, explain them clearly. Why me? You are in a good flow. Go with it. Okay, sir. In the first painting, when the two meet. Sky gave a signal through lightening that they should not talk. Really? Yeah. In the second painting, when he proposes. A big wave signaled them no by rising up and high. Seriously? Whoa! When they were making love. The iceberg signaled them not to do it. According to this and what my sir said. Every time a guy and a girl get into a relationship. Nature sends them some signal against it. Do you know what happens when you ignore the signal? What? -I will show you. What? -I will show you. Come. This is the destruction that will happen. That is why this is a Natures revenge story. Useless fellow! I did not know my painting meant such extreme things. Breaking news! Devotees smash their leader for preaching a philosophy he does not follow. I want nothing to do with this. Hello, Amrutha. Tell me. Hello, sir. We admitted mom in the hospital this afternoon. Which hospital? What happened? Mom had a heart stroke. She is getting a stent. She will be fine. Do not worry. Doctor? It could have been critical. We did an angiogram and inserted a stent. You can see her in the morning. Okay, doctor. How many times have I told you let us go to the doctor? You never listen! Now see. You are in pain. What would we do without you? Ah, come on, dad! I can not watch your melodrama anymore. She is fine, right? Doctors will take care of her. You do not worry. I got really worried when this happened, sir. What if something happened to her? I would have had to postpone my Australia plan. I would have had to postpone my Australia plan. What Australia plan? Oh, I did not tell you. I am going to Australia in 10 days. I did not tell my parents either. Why all of a sudden? They will start all that emotional drama about marriage in some days. You are good, sir. You will convince anybody. I cannot do that. That is why I have decided to go far from them. Get a squeeze of lemon. Why is he dull, man? Amruthas leaving to Australia. So what now? I do not know. That bloody book! I am going to rip it off. Those poems are screwing with my head. Life has turned dark for the person who invented the bulb. Sim card has been blocked for the tele communications owner itself. Google maps has forgot it’s way back to home. Bad time has started for the watch which shows us the right time. I have just lit the match stick and the whole house caught fire. I words i have told in the past life are now effecting my bright future. Do not leave me Amrutha. I will become a drunkard I swear, I will become lonely if you leave me and go. Do not leave me Amrutha. I will become a drunkard. I swear, I will become lonely if you leave me and go. Let us go. Hey Stop Stop. Let us go to the University, sir. Why? I have to look over the meeting arrangements. You are not a kid to console you with a chocolate. You are so strong like gum and you torture me. I can not slap you, even if I want to. You will kill me, if I want to hug you say this. You will kill me, if I want to hug you say this. Do not be like a stone? If you think with your heart, You will change your decision. Open the gate of your heart and peep into it. You can find me, because you love me. Do not leave me Amrutha I’ll become a drunkard. I swear, I will become lonely if you leave me and go. Do not leave me Amrutha I will become a drunkard I swear, I will become lonely if you leave me and go. Let us collect the passport and flight tickets and go. Sir, you also come with me. You go. I will wait outside. Okay. I will just come. Sir, let us go. You come so close to me. Before I scream and ask you to stay, you go far away. Why do not you stay? Please! You know how this feels like? It is like giving a boon and then immediately cursing the person. What are you saying, sir? I am saying this with the experience of travelling solo in life. When you are travelling alone, even the smallest distance feels the farthest. When you are with someone, even the longest distance feels the closest. The happiness I never had in these 30 years. You gave me that in just the last couple of days. Why do not you let this happiness remain for a lifetime, Amrutha? I want to marry you, Amrutha. Stop it, sir! I have believed in your philosophy like it is the Vedas. How can you say this now? No, listen. So you have been manipulating us all these years. Pretending these last few days. And cheating us this whole time. You are a cheater! Never show me your face again. Please! Amrutha! Sir! Let us go? It is done. Let us go? It is done. Bye sir. Sir! I got my VISA. I will leave once the meeting is done. Everything will go smoothly, right? Hmm. Thank you, sir. Bye! Virat! Virat! Wake up. What is it, dad? What happened? I will tell you. Come with me. Loneliness has been waging a war at me every night. I have been fighting it with courage. But last night. My courage lost to loneliness. You might think that I am okay. But I am not at all fine. I do not mean to hurt you. It is just that I can not live like this. So I am dying. Forgive me. Solo life is a soulless life. Hey, Virat! Solo Life Is So Better! Sometimes to wipe our tears. Even both the hands do not seem to be enough. You are my God in disguise, sir. I promise you that I will change your daughters opinion and marry her. I am leaving to Australia in 10 days. After watching uncle take his life because he couldn’t bear the loneliness. I am scared. I understand what a big mistake I have done. What hurts me is. I could make so many people believe that love and marriage hurt you. But I am unable to convince one girl that love and marriage are a good thing. Damn it! Amruthas crazy, mom. She took me for my words and decided to go to Australia to distance herself from everybody. I do not get how I can convince her. She will understand when you tell her that your opinion has changed. They say it is okay to lie to any extent to make a marriage happen. But nobody wonders What if one of those lies made the marriage crumble? Because you believed your philosophy was right back then. You advocated it strongly. Now when you believe that is wrong, much strongly than before. Why are you hesitating? Go tell her. You are right, dad. Hello. Amrutha. I need to see you urgently. Can you come to Kailasagiri? Sure, sir. I will be there. Okay. Bye. Hello. Where are you? Hello, dude. Who are you, bro? Ravan from Lanka. What are you doing on the phone? You only told me that the right time to kidnap Sita is when Rama is not around. I took her. Dude, you do not need Hanuman to find out the location. I am at the port area. Come and get Sita. Then I will agree that you are Lord Rama. Dude! You knocked me down last time because I was short of soldiers. This time, I am here with an entire battalion. Well prepared! This is Kumbhakarna. This is Indrajit. I dare you to beat them now and take her. Take her! Go! Ten heads have been smashed. What about you? You only tell me, dude. Be it Lanka or the port. Lord Rama prevails in the end. Dude, you are Rama. That is final. Can I go now? Hmm. Dude gave me absolute clarity yet again. Let’s get out of here. What about Sita? Some guy calls himself Ravan and argues it immediately. Everybody calls you Rama. But you do not get it. What are you saying? I wanted to meet you to talk about something important. Actually, I only wanted to talk to you. You should know what happened before you called. Get everything ready, okay? Okay, bye. Amrutha. Bank Manager called. We do not have to go for a loan for money. Tell me how much you need. I will arrange it for you. Dad, why? I will not trouble you anymore, Amrutha. Do whatever you want. But, do not forget that you are all that me and your mothers got. Poor guy! I feel sorry for him. There is nothing going on between us, dad. He strictly condemns relationships and emotions. He strictly condemns relationships and emotions. If there is nothing going on between you two. Why did you call him when you have so many friends? If he had no emotions. Why did he spend the entire night here with us like family? Do you know why I was so worried about your mother? Because only I know how my life is going to be without her. All this might sound like melodrama to you. But when he is no more by your side. You will feel the lack of his presence. If only Lord Rama was with Goddess Sita that day. Goddess Sita wouldn’t have to go through so much. Goddess Sita wouldn’t have to go through so much. You are always around, whenever I am in a tough situation. Solo life is soul less life. Oh. There is great love between us, sir. Listen, Amrutha. According to poem no. 65. Enough of your poems, sir. I am telling you it is all crap. Yes. It is wrong. Turn your brain off for once and think with your heart. Please. You will understand. No, Amrutha. According to my philosophy, Solo Life. I will tell you something if you promise not to let go. Hmm? I already knew that my philosophy was trash. Hey. Do not let go. Hold tight. Tighter. It is not just about love. When you are honest in your approach. Even Nature favors you automatically. Sir! We are good now. Sir! We are good now. But, what about our members? We want Justice! Poem no. 44. You only told us not to give anyone the consent to hurt us. But just because everything is going well for you, you hit on a girl. You know how difficult that is? Hitting on a girl. Okay. Calm down. Dude, listen to me. Try to understand. We feel sad when the hero and heroine are not together by climax in a movie. But if there’s no guy or girl in your life in reality. You do not have to let others hurt you. You will hurt yourself. Poem no. 35. Law of Nature. I am coming to that point. Law of Nature! What did Murthy bro say in the interview that day? What did Murthy bro say in the interview that day? Two birds. Two snakes. All the creatures are abiding by the Law of Nature. We humans should do too. We should get married. Solo Life Is So Better, sir. Yes! So better! So better! But until when? What is your age? I will be 20 soon. That is the problem. Once you are 30, do you know how it feels to be called an uncle? How it feels when an auntie, much older than you, proposes marriage. How it feels when you realize your own philosophy is wrong. Listen, kid. I am saying this from my own experience. Trust me. Solo Life Is Not So Better. It is So Boring. What? You do not believe me? Alright then. I will write another compilation of 108 poems on why you should love and why you should get ma Would that convince you? When will you write it, sir? Sir, I have a doubt. There is no decor or relatives. When are you getting married, sir? When am I getting married? Yes sir. Bro, really, really thanks. You have got me a great alliance. Sister-in-law is average. My wife is smoking hot. Hey! I have watched Srinivasa Kalyanam movie once again. You have missed a chant somewhere. Say it. That is right. Say it loudly. He forgot! Govind! You are really a pain.
