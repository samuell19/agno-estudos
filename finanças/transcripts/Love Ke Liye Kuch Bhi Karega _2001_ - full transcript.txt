"For love..." "Will do anything for love" This is Bombay. Oh, sorry! Mumbai. Its population is more than 1 crore. All kinds of people live here, with all kinds of dreams. Some want money, some want love, some want respect some want a car, and some want everything. This is Vijay Sharma. He works in a bank. He is married. He even has two kids. This is Seema Khanna. She works in some private company. She had a love marriage recently. After marriage, she has fallen in love with Vijay Sharma. Yes. Meet him. He is Johny, a pizza delivery boy. He is pretty popular among middle-aged married women. He delivers much more than just pizzas. But our film story has nothing to do with these people. Our film story is about them. She is Sapna. She loves to paint. Apart from that, her hobbies include singing classical dance, yoga, handicraft, gardening photography, poetry, making candles, pottery making, Reiki... In short, Sapna's life is dedicated to art. And today, she is having an exhibition of her best paintings in this art gallery. Is this a horse or a dog? -Horse. But it looks like a dog to me. It is surprising how such worthless paintings are being exhibited here. Who can refuse the daughter of Rajiv Chopra. This work is definitely of a genius. Do you know what is special about it? - What? - The eyes. There is so much depth in these eyes. - Who must have done this? - Me. You? I am so sorry. Actually, I was not kissing you - but the genius painter within you. - Thank you. The one who is showering this false praise is Prakash. He is always looking for an opportunity. He never lets an opportunity go by. Look! He's caught it! - This is Sapna's father, Rajiv Chopra. - Hello! He is a renowned businessman. He has two factories in Mumbai, three in Hyderabad four in Delhi, two in Ahmedabad and many more. This man Das Babu, is working since 25 years in this company. Those working for Chopra respect him very much. And Chopra humiliates those who work for him. Send this cheque of 2 crore to Mr. Mehra of Delhi. - What happened? - Sir, sir! An increment of Rs.300?! Does money grow on trees? I have worked hard to make my money. You people do not know the value of money. Want a Rs.300 increment indeed! Go away! Poor Das Babu! No, Das Babu has not come here to commit suicide. They have all come here to have fun. There's lack of space in Mumbai so such sights are common here. What is this? Prakash and Sapna together? Prakash managed to woo Sapna with his false praise of her paintings. He is reading Sapna's hand but trying to make his own destiny. But who is this Prakash? What does he do? - He loves me, papa. - What work does he do? He is looking for a job. Besides, you are there. I am talking about him and you are talking about me. Papa! What difference does it make? Anyway, after marriage... try to understand, child. Prakash does not have our kind of status. Father and daughter argued so much over Prakash that Sapna threatened to leave the house. This blackmail worked and Chopra had to bow before his daughter's wishes. Prakash got married to Sapna. How fortunate! In one stroke, he jumped from the bus into an imported car. You call such a man in Mumbai smart! Good morning. Listen! But poor Prakash is unaware that Rajiv Chopra is waiting for him. Good morning, dad. Did you call me? - In fact, while coming here, I was thinking. - Get up. What? I said stand up! Get up. This is my office, not a local train of Mumbai that you can just barge in. Now, first get permission. Get out. May I take this? Stapler. - May I come in? Come in. What is this? What is this? Whom did you ask before passing this order? Sir, in the interest of the company... You don't have to think about the interest of the company. I have given you a cabin in this office because you have become my son-in-law. Sir, even I want to do something. One of the toilet's flush is not working. Go and mend it. Right now! Go! Poor guy! He got a wife, a house, car, love, everything. He only didn't get respect. Bad luck. As a matter of fact, even he is going through bad luck. He is Rahul. Rahul Kapoor talks less, thinks more. And he is always looking for work. And this guy runs away from work. And he is his friend, Harilal alias Harry. He is sleeping right now. Let him sleep, we'll meet him later. These two came to Mumbai in search of a job. Their search is still on. Good morning. Your dream broke? Scratch your head and come awake! Go to sleep. It is only 10:30. And this man who has just come out of the bathroom is the landlord, Murthy, Dakshina Murthy. He is from Kuduppa Patamal some village in South India. He bathes every day and also prays everyday. And she is Rameshwari, Dakshina Murthy's wife. She gets along more with God than her husband. With which God, that is difficult to say. Soni and Guddu are children of the neighbours. They eat here and sleep at home. Oh La La La! She is Anjali, their daughter. She is the only one worth looking at in the entire family. She is totally unabashed. She has just grown up and has also fallen in love. With him. In 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' (TV show) Amitabh is unique! One should be like him. It's you! I was going for an interview, so I was praying to the one above. Do think of those living downstairs also sometimes. You don't have to say that. You are my landlord. I had forgotten that I am the landlord of this house. So who are you? -Sir, I am your tenant. You remember everything else but not paying my rent. I will pay up as soon as I get a job. You are saying that since the past six months. - Job, job, job. - Listen! - What happened! - Hello aunty. It's been four days since the mixer's blade broke, kindly get it repaired. Hold on! If he goes, I won't find him for next 6 months. Manage it with my shaving blade. Do it yourself then! - So what was I saying? -You were talking about the mixer. Forget the mixer, when will you pay the rent? - As soon as I get a job. - Give me a date. Father, uncle has called from Guntur. The call has to come now! Be careful, he mustn't move! Okay, I'll see to it. - Wait! - Yes. Wait, it's your brother who has called. Stupid! Let's escape! Come! Anjali, Anjali, your daddy Anjali... - What's on the job front? - Nothing much. I have got a call for an interview today. - Let's see what happens. - You'll succeed this time. You had said this even the last time. I will say that to you always. But how long can this go on? Only a few more days. You will soon get a job. - What if I don't? - Then I will take up a job. You can manage the house while I go to work. And when I return home, tired, you serve me, okay? Agreed. Anything else? Yes. Cooking food, looking after the kids, washing clothes getting up early, you'll have to do all this. All right, but stop day dreaming now. See a dream with me. - What? - Dream. "That happens that which just happens" "Nothing happens in that it happens" "That happens that which just happens" "Nothing happens in that it happens" "That has happened to me, oh Lord!" "That has happened to me, oh Lord!" "Nothing happens in that it happens" "Silently something disappears" "My heart has disappeared, oh Lord!" "Oh Lord! Oh Lord!" "Oh Lord! Oh Lord!" "We hear in the dreams, something similar" "We wrap in our sleep, the nights knitted together" "We hear in the dreams, something similar" "We wrap in our sleep, the nights knitted together" "The eyes have the story" "Spoken by the dreams" "Stayed awake all night" "Slept in the morning, Oh Lord." "Slept in the morning, Oh Lord" "The feet in love, find the path new" "The face of every stone is like God" "The feet in love, find the path new" "The face of every stone is like God" "If you see it, it is foolishness" "If you understand, it is romantic" "This false moment" "How did it become true, Oh Lord! Oh Lord!" "How did it become true, Oh Lord! Oh Lord!" "That happens that which just happens" "Nothing happens in that it happens" "That has happened to me" "My heart has disappeared" "Silently something disappears" "That has happened to me, Oh Lord" Baby, you dance well, maybe the dance floor is not good. - Hi. - Hi. - Sir, enough for today. - All right. What is the matter? Why are you silent? - It's nothing. - There is something. Tell me. I don't think your father likes me. What are you talking? He was so rude to me in office today over such a small matter. It seems like he doesn't need me there. Prakash, don't feel offended by what papa says. In the beginning, he used to talk like that even about Zany. But gradually, he began to like him. Right, Zany? You'll see, he'll begin to like you too. Zany, take care of Prakash, I'll speak to papa and come. All right? Yes dear, but he placed a wrong order which was not in the interest of the company - so I explained it to him. - Oh! Papa, it will take Prakash some time to learn the office work. Yes, but it will take me some time to teach him too. And then, you know my nature. Yes papa, I told Prakash the same thing. - Give the phone to Prakash. - Yes, papa. Papa wants to talk to you. - Hello. - Prakash dear. Yes, tell me. If ever you carry tales to Sapna again I'll teach you a lesson you must not have even dreamt of. Give the phone to Sapna. - Hello! - I have explained to him there won't be any problem now. Though it will take some time to make him understand. No problem, papa, teach him well. - Okay, dear. Okay, papa. Thank you. - Love you, papa. - Love you, dear. - Bye. - Bye. Happy? Zany, come on. Let's get you some milk. Come on. Rahul, what are you doing here? Murthy is sitting on a chair at the gate. Then why are you sitting here? We stay here because we pay rent. He's not doing us any favour, understand! That's true, but we have not paid the rent since six months. Now he is doing us a favour. We have not paid the rent since six months? All the money goes into your lavish lifestyle. Cigarettes, liquor, flowers for women, movie tickets. I have an idea! What if we ask money from Aslam bhai (don)? Aslam bhai? Don't we have enough problems already? If he doesn't get his money on time, we'll end up in a hospital. Don't worry about that, I know Aslam bhai's weakness. Aslam Bhai has come! - Will you smoke beedi? - No,Bhai You smoke cigarettes. You are pretty loaded. No, Bhai. Why didn't you send the weekly protection money? Business is down. Do you have a mint to print these? One who cheats Aslam, lands up in the hospital. - Order for tea. - Give tea to Aslam bhai. What a punch Bhai! If that punch is shown on screen it will put even Shah Rukh and Salman to shame. Is that your hand or a hammer? - Order one tea for him too. - Add some cream to it. Give one more tea. - What is the matter? - Bhai, I needed some money. What were you saying about Shah Rukh? Oh yes! I was saying that you fight better in real life than even a hero in reel life. - You are a super action star. - Of course not. You are laughing? I am telling the truth. The punch you hit will put even Akshay Kumar to shame. You are flattering me, aren't you? Of course not! You wanted something? Yes, I wanted two to four thousand rupees. - Two or four thousand? - Four. - When will you return it? - In about 4-5 days. - Four or five? - Five. - Give him Rs.4000. - Yes Bhai. - Take. - Thank you Bhai. - Go. - Bye. Aslam Bhai, why are you so charmed by films? Speak only when I ask you to. Tell him that! Sorry, I made a mistake. Made a mistake indeed! Will I earn fame in the film world? You will be a hit! Isn't it? What will I lose in trying anyway? You will be superb! - Let's begin with God's name. - Yes. One must even diversify sometimes, right or not? - Of course, one must. - He doesn't understand! Come, Das Babu. What brings you here? Sir, the big boss had called. He will be late today. So he has asked you to receive the American delegation. What do I do? You saw how he was shouting at me that day. And today, when he has some work, he thought of me. I am not some dog who the master calls and it runs to him wagging his tail. Mr. Prakash, until you don't meet the office staff how will you learn the work here. You only have to manage all this in the future. Yes, that's true. - Hello. - Hello. - Welcome to India. - Thank you. - Nice to meet you. - This is Mike. Nice to meet you. - This is Celina. - Hello. - That's Symond. - Hello. - And that's Philips. - Hi. - Please follow me. - Thank you. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - Is everything all right? - Yes, Mr. Prakash is talking to them. - That's very nice. - Yes, that's great. Good morning, dad. Gentlemen, my father-in-law, Mr. Rajiv Chopra. Excuse me. How many times have I told you to keep your mouth shut? - Dad, listen - Shut up. I had asked you to receive them, not to talk nonsense. Now get out. And send coffee for all of them. Get out. Hi. What is the matter? - Send coffee. - What? Your father told me in the office in everyone's presence to send coffee. I am an M.B.A for God sake. I am the Assistant Manager. I am Rajiv Chopra's son-in-law that is why I have been given a big cabin. Not to work, but only to sit in. Prakash... Look Sapna, I don't want to be treated specially. At least give me some work that I can respectably do. In Rajiv Chopra's office, from the peon to the manager everyone knows what work he has to do, except me. For the first time, I feel I am incapable of doing anything. I mean... whatever I may have been before marriage at least I had some regard for myself. But your father has put me in such a situation where I pity myself. - So what do you want to do? - I don't know. I want to do something independently. But where will I get the money from? I don't understand anything. Who are you talking about? The one who lives in the third lane, last building, 2nd floor and in the first flat. You are too much! I cannot manage a single woman and you are flirting with four of them. Four? But I didn't tell you about Dolly and Pooja? Dolly and Pooja? -They are twins. If you worked so hard to get a job... That reminds me, give me rupees 50. I want to get the bio-data typed. I don't have time for your Dolly and Pooja. - I never mix passion and profession. - Oh yes! Both are two different things. I'll never fall in love. Why? What's wrong in falling in love? It's too much of a hassle. Hi. -Rahul, papa is talking of fixing my marriage. Congratulations, sister-in-law. Not with Rahul, with someone else. - What? - With who? Some stupid fellow. Papa says he earns 20-25 thousand a month. So what did you say? She said that even you earn 20-25 thousand a month. - Shut up Harry. - Okay. - Why are you getting angry with him? - Then what do I do? Go and speak to papa. But what will I speak with your papa? Speak about the weather. Speak about your marriage, of course! Wait a minute. Anjali, you know my financial state. I cannot even pay the rent, what will I tell your papa? Rahul, you don't know what I am going through. And anyway, you'll have to speak to papa one day. Have you brought the rent? Come inside. Aren't you ashamed not to pay the rent? I want to speak to you. First, pay the rent, then I'll listen to you all day. I... I love Anjali. Listen, what is he saying about Anjali? Anjali? Nothing, he's just saying that Anjali is a good girl. -Yes. Very good! How intelligent! I don't understand. It is so simple! You had to pay the rent earlier. After marriage you will stay here as a son-in-law so everything will be free. You are misunderstanding me. After marriage, I will... - You will look for another house? - Yes. If you find a fool like me, you'll swindle him too. No, I will pay there on time. You will give it on time. All right, so there you will pay the rent on time. You will also need lots of money for food, clothes, outings. Tell me, will you look for a job after marriage or... I will find a job first. And I am confident I will get a good job very soon. A good job? I have been hearing that since a year now. Rahul, I have fixed Anjali's marriage for next month. The boy has a good job, his own house. I understand your feelings, you also understand mine. Love cannot fill one's stomach. One needs money to run a house. Cash. There is still one month to the marriage. If you get a job by then there's no objection to marriage. Okay? Okay. If you have any idea, suggest it. I do have an idea. But he cannot handle it. Then tell me. Think again. Stop acting and tell me. - Then listen. Elope with him. - What do you say? Have you even lost your mind along with him? Elope to a place where it's just you, me and our love! Your father was right, love does not fill one's stomach. Then you should have thought about it before falling in love. Harilal, God has given us a mouth to speak and brains to think. Please, think before you speak. Anjali, don't you have faith on me? Believe me, I will do something. - And anyway I... - Do what you like. But if I don't get married to you, you don't know what I can do. Anjali, listen. Anjali! Anjali! She can do anything. - Papa. - Yes? I want to speak to you. Prakash is not bothering you, is he? No papa, it is not that. Actually Prakash is not happy working with you. He wants to work somewhere else? No, he wants to do something independently. It is good to be independent. See, even I made something of myself on my own. I am a self made man. Yes papa, but Prakash needs your help. My blessings are always with him. Papa, Prakash's project idea is very good. I want you to help Prakash in this project financially. Oh. That means he wants to make something of himself with my help. Yes, papa. You'll see papa, one day, Prakash will make something of himself, even he will prosper. That day, even you will feel proud of him. But he needs your financial support now. Please, papa. Yes, why not? If Prakash has a good idea, why will I not help him? As soon as his project file is ready ask him to come and meet me. Met your papa? - Yes. - What did he say? Nothing, we just had a general discussion. Just had a talk! I knew papa will not take any interest in my project. That's true, but perhaps if I force him then... - Then? - Then maybe papa will agree. - Papa has agreed! - What?! Yes, papa has agreed. What will you give me now? "Think about what you will do, tell me what you'll do, darling!" "Think about what you will do, tell me what you'll do, darling!" "When the whole world will be at our feet. -The whole world!" "The cloud will be our pillow and the sky will be a mattress" "The cloud" "We have to go to the moon" "No, no, we have to bring it here" "The tiger in the jungle" "we have to recite a poem to him" "Whatever you say, will happen" "Think about what you will do, tell me what you'll do, darling!" "As you say, we will do that, darling" "Hey darling" "Think that the birds" "are singing our stories" "Look even the mountains" "are bowing their heads in our path" "I just have one dream" "have to go to a far away place" "We have to go to America" "No, no, there is too much crowd there" "The ice in Russia" "The heat in Africa" "Whatever you say, will happen" "Think about what you will do, tell me what you'll do, darling!" "As you say, we will do that, darling, darling, darling" "Think, on the banks" "the waves of the sea are calling" "Look even the branches" "of the trees make swings for us" "In this shower" "every drop is yours" "Have to take a shower in the rains" "The rains are just an excuse" "We have to twist life" "And have to drown in it's happiness" "Will you too come along with me?" "Darling!" "Think about what you will do, tell me what you'll do, darling!" "When the whole world will be at our feet. -The whole world!" "The cloud will be our pillow, and the sky will be a mattress" "The cloud" "We have to go to the moon" "No, no, we have to bring it here" "The tiger in the jungle" "we have to recite a poem to him" "Whatever you say, will happen" Bhai, it was a mistake. I made it? -No, I did. No, I made a mistake. I explained you nicely, but you did not understand. You acted smart. So I will have to teach you a lesson. Hey Hero! Aslam Bhai, you and here? In fact I was looking for you. What for? -Rahul didn't give you the paper? - What paper? - Today's paper. - What's in it? - An advertisement. I mean, Subhash Ghai is starting a new film. So? Subhash Ghai is looking for a new hero for his new film. So I was thinking why not you give it a try? As if he is going to take me as a hero. That is what even Jackie Shroff used to say. Subhash Ghai saw him and made him the hero of his film "Hero." Look where he is today! I will go and get the paper. Do you think Subhash Ghai will give me a chance? Of course Bhai. 100 percent. When will you return my money? Tomorrow. 100 percent. - Where is Subhash's office? - Bandra. - How much percent? - Of course 100 percent! You go. "You are my dearest, you are my love" "You are the hero of my love story" May I come in, sir? Dad, this is the file of my project. I knew it! I knew it that you would like this idea. The moment this website enters the market it will create a sensation. You cannot even imagine how good this will be for the company. Isn't it a great idea, sir? It is a stupid idea. Utter nonsense. First, you trapped my daughter, now you want to trap me? What are you saying? My intention... I am very well aware of your intention but Sapna is not. You worthless man! Whether you live in a bungalow or the street you'll never change. Because basically, you are a fool! Sir, if I am sitting here quietly, it doesn't mean... It means that you are not capable of speaking. Stay within your limits. Now get lost! Listen, if you tell my daughter anything I will forget that you are my son-in-law. I will send you back to the place from where you have come. Now get out. Two weeks? But I want to join from tomorrow. Look, don't worry about money. You will get all the money in advance. I will get a black belt in ten days, won't I? Okay, thank you. Yes! Prakash, you know what, from tomorrow I... will be joining karate classes. Isn't it exciting? Oh, by the way, how was your meeting? It was great. Dad liked the idea very much. He spoke of starting the project very soon. Yeah! I knew it, I knew it. You had worked so hard on it. I am so proud of you. Oh Prakash, isn't it great. Rajiv Chopra I will get money out of you! By fair means or foul. But how? This is how this department is! Hello! Hey! - What is it? - Bhai has come. My brother died five years ago. You good for nothing! Aslam Bhai has come. Give donation for Ganesh festival. A Muslim asking for a donation for Ganesh festival. Yes! Where donation and business are concerned I believe in one religion. But Bhai, my brother died five years ago. Since then, I never celebrate Ganesh festival. Because you lost your brother, you stopped believing in God? Man can leave God, but God never leaves man. But Aslam bhai never spares anybody. Come on, give donation. - But donation... - He is our man. - Ask him to give donation. - You haven't given him donation? - Get lost, go away from here! - Hey, you! Aslam Bhai, what did Subhash Ghai say? What will he say? He has cast Hrithik. - Subhash Ghai told you that? - No, his boy told me. - Then meet Yash Chopra. - He will not take me. Shah Rukh is his favourite. Not is, was. After 'Mohabbatein' (movie), they hate each other. What do you mean? Shah Rukh is no more popular, Hrithik is busy. That leaves who? That is what I am telling you. I can even imagine your posters. Yash Chopra presents, "Aslam Bhai Dulhaniya Le Jayenge." "When I saw you my love, I knew" Economics, 89 percent. Good. Accounts, 74 percent. Very good. Do you have any experience with computers? Yes sir, I have even done a course in computers. Do you know that the man who came here before you was more qualified than you. What he lacked was courage or enthusiasm like you. Thank you, sir. Our company needs people like you. - Well, young man, you are selected. - Thank you, sir. Just that... come and meet me at my residence in the evening at six. Here my visiting card. To complete some formalities. - I'm fine. You go in, sir. Wait a minute. - Did you get the job? - Yes. He must have asked you to call in the evening. -Yes. Keep Rs.2 lakhs ready. What for? That's because so many people like you come here. Everyone gets a visiting card, but who gets the job? Next. Rs.2 lakhs? You mean a bribe? Yes, bribe. I am even ready to pay a bribe to get a job but where do I get the money from? If I don't get this job Murthy will get Anjali married to someone else. Rahul, Anjali will not marry anyone else. I know, but you know Murthy, he can do anything. Anjali cannot live without and I... I mean we both cannot live without each other. Only if I can get Rs.2 lakhs all my problems will be solved. But I don't know what to do! Don't worry, you'll get the job. How can I? And anyway, there is so little time. I was foolish to think I will get another job so soon. Harry, can't we somehow, anyhow, get Rs.2 lakhs? It will be wrong to do such work. Don't teach me right or wrong. You have been trying to get a job since the past one year. What came of it? Nothing! And today when you are getting a job you have to pay a bribe of Rs.2 lakhs. Why do you have to pay a bribe? Don't pay. Even paying a bribe is wrong. Look Rahul, one sometimes has to do wrong to do something right. And anyway, we don't have to do this always. Once we get what we want, we'll close the chapter. You mean... I mean we will have to commit some crime. Yes. We'll have to do something different. Can't we commit some crime where no one loses anything? There is. We'll commit suicide. No one will lose anything if we die. I am not saying we commit some dacoity or murder. I am saying we should commit such a crime where someone should not lose much, but just a little. That is what I am saying. I know that is what you are saying. But listen to what I am saying. If someone has Rs.1 crore. and if we take Rs.2 lakhs from it - what is left with him? - Rs.98 lakhs. Correct. So he loses only Rs.2 lakhs. While we can make our lives with it. Rich people come to five star hotels eat and make merry late into the night and spend thousands of rupees. So? Expensive watches, gold rings, chains they have so much with them. If we loot even one person, our mission will be accomplished. But where will we loot? In the car parking area. There is no one there except darkness. We will hide there. The moment we see some rich man, we'll loot him. That's it. - It won't be much of a problem. - Yes. How will we scare him? This looks real! - We need real money, don't we? - Yes. Someone coming. Ready? He didn't look too rich, did he? - Come, let's check him. - Yes. Beware! Don't try to move! - Who are you? - Underworld. - Underworld? - We are goons. Give us your money! Down! Come. Where are you taking me? Come. Hand over your money! - What is this? - It's a Rs.500 note. - It's real. - Do you take us to be fools? Come on, hurry, give us the money, or we will torture you. - Look, I don't have any more money. - Khalid, tell him who we are! Yes. We are very dangerous. We only had kidnapped the daughter of Kishen Patel. It had made headlines. Now give us your money or do you also want to appear in tomorrow's headlines? If you like, you can search me. Do we look like constables to you? You don't know what all we do. Hey you tell him. Thefts, dacoity, murder, gambling kidnapping and even match fixing. Did you hear that? Check your pockets. Did you come to drink in the five star hotel for free? Give that ring. Hurry! Give it. Fast. Check him properly. Let's get out of here quickly. Excuse me! What will you get by selling all this? Rupees ten-twenty thousand at the most. You are from the underworld, aren't you? Yes, so? I have a plan with which you can make lakhs. - What will you gain from it? I need some money. Then why don't you ask your father-in-law? But what problem do you have? I will hatch the entire plan. I will even get the money. You'll are professional criminals, aren't you? That we are, that is why we are inquiring so much. What else do you'll want to know? Look, even you will make money and even I will. It's the work of maximum 5-6 hour. What do you say? We'll have to ask Bhai. You'll belong to the underworld, don't you? Yes, but we'll have to ask big boss. - One minute. - What is it? When will you give me your decision? What is the hurry? We told you we'll have to ask big boss. We will ask him and call you. Now leave! Harry, I think there is something fishy in this. And what I see is only the money we'll get in it. - But what if we fall into trouble? - Rahul - the idea of kidnapping is whose? - His. - And whose money is it? - His father-in-law's. Whose headache is it to bring the money to us? His. - Whose wife? - His. Only ministers in our country get an opportunity to do something so safe, not common people like us. What if police comes into the picture? Rahul, this is a family matter, how can the police come into it? - She has come! - She has come! What were you talking about the police? Police? - Foolish. - Foolish. - Who is foolish? - He. - No, no, he! - Yes, me. I was telling him to find a job quickly or else... -Yes. So Rahul said that he will kill your father. - What? - What? Yes! Yes. I will kill your father to get you. Have you gone crazy? Everything will be all right. - I am with you. - I know. Don't be foolish. Even I was telling him the same thing. What is in this? - I forgot! They are sweets for you. - Thanks. Don't worry, okay. A jackpot of Rs.50 lakhs! Rs.25 lakhs for him and Rs.25 lakhs ours. Rs.12.5 lakhs for you and Rs.12.5 lakhs for me. You pay Rs.2 lakhs to get yourself a job. You get married to Anjali. I will buy myself a car for Rs.5 lakhs out of my share of Rs.12.5 lakhs. What you do with the rest of the money is your problem. I will go on a world tour with my money. I will go to America with Anju, to Switzerland with Seema to London with Leena and to Paris with Pooja. I can see a beautiful life ahead of me!

Have you forgotten? Sultan Ahmed. Sultan Bhai, I am Prakash speaking. I know. I have phoned you then naturally you only will be on the phone. - What have you decided? - Big boss said. What did he say? I am Khalid Mohammed speaking. Greetings, Khalid Bhai. We will kidnap your wife. Is that clear? Thank you, sir. Thank you. Okay, put the phone down. "Love is crazy, lover" "When I saw you, my lover" - "Love is crazy, lover" Shanti! - "From here, where will I go" - Prakash! - Oh, my leg. Hey, what happened? - My leg! - Prakash! - You wait, I'm coming. Come here. Prakash! Prakash! Prakash! Prakash! Quietly surrender yourself or we will torture you so much that you'll never see your face in the mirror... Save me. Help me. Prakash! Prakash! She threw chilly sauce in our eyes and disappeared. Quick! Hurry! Your wife is dangerous, very dangerous. - You should have warned us. - Come on, lift her. Be careful. Look, please take care of her. You first arrange for the money. - I will call within two hours. - Okay. What is this? - Nothing. - Nothing. Nothing? - A mattress? - Donkey? Not a donkey, it is a mattress, a cotton mattress. Cotton mattress? - What happened? - Hello, aunty. Let's go! You have a bed, why do you need this mattress? We are making preparations for the marriage, uncle. Marriage! Dad, Sapna has been kidnapped. Yes. I just came home and saw the entire house in a mess. And Sapna was not in. And then the kidnappers called... Who will believe this? The old man will never believe it. Hello dad, Sapna has been kidnapped. I just came home and saw the entire house in a mess... Emotion is lacking. Dad, Sapna has been kidnapped. I had gone out. When I returned, the house was in a mess. And Sapna was not here. Dad, please save my Sapna. Rajiv Chopra, I will show you what a smart man is like. Hello. Hello, Hello! Will you just keep saying hello or say something? Dad, I am Prakash speaking. What is the matter, why did you call me? Dad, Sapna has been kidnapped. What! Sapna has been kidnapped? Yes, I came home just now. The entire house was in a mess. And Sapna was not here. - I got a call from the kidnappers, dad. - So? They were saying that if I want to see Sapna alive again then I will have to pay them. Dad, please save Sapna, dad please! If they are asking for money pay them, why are you bothering me? Hello, dad? Dad! Chopra! Hey Chopra! Chopra! Sir, master is bathing. - What? - Master is bathing. - He is bathing? - Yes. Chopra! Chopra! Hey Chopra! - Who is it? - Come out! - What nonsense is this? - You should feel ashamed of yourself! I always thought that you just hated me. But I have realised that you don't love anybody. Sapna is your only daughter, she has been kidnapped. And you are so cool about it? - Are you in your senses? -I have come to my senses now. I am seeing what I never saw before. This bungalow, millions of rupees, an only daughter. Those who have kidnapped Sapna are very dangerous. If they don't get money... That means Sapna has truly been kidnapped? Then do you think I am joking? I thought it was the 1st of April today, so... - April fool? - Yes. It is me who is a fool to have called you, Rajiv Chopra. My Sapna! If anything happens to Sapna, I will never forgive you. But who are these people? You don't know how dangerous we are. I am Khalid Mohammed and he is Sultan Ahmed. - You must have heard about us. - No. Why, don't you read the newspaper? - I do. - Which? - Times of India! - Don't you read the Punjab Kesari? Look, my father knows all the prominent police officers. We are not afraid of the police, the police is afraid of us. We play the game of cat and mice with the police. - The police are the mice. - And we are the cats. What I meant to say is... You don't say anything, you stay quiet. - Or we will have to kill you. - I will do as you say. How long will I have to stay here? Until your father sends us all the money. But I don't have a change of clothes. Have you come here on a picnic? If you talk any more... Press harder. Don't you eat any food? Aslam Bhai, take this, your collection. Put it in that box. Aslam Bhai. - Yes? - That jeweller in Baiganwadi didn't pay the weekly protection money. Take two boys along with you, bring his cash box - and also bring him along. - All right, Bhai. Bhai, Harry is here. Greetings, Aslam Bhai. Do I have to call you? - I...I have gone to see a film, "Shakti." - So? Amitabh has acted so well in the film and I remembered you. First class acting! What first class? He was no good in comparison to Yusuf in that film. - Yusuf Bhai? Who is he? - Dilip Kumar. He was so good that Amitabh was nothing against him. You are absolutely right. Amitabh could not act against Dilip Kumar. It's not like that, pal. Even Amitabh Bachchan is a good actor. He has acted well in Laawaris, Sharabi and Deewar. There is no actor better than him today. Yes, you are right. - There is. - Who? You, Bhai. - What are you saying! Me and acting? - Yes. - Get me a plate of kebabs.-Yes, Bhai. I am telling the truth, Bhai. You are a first class actor. Forget it! Who will want to see my acting? Why do you say that? We are there. We will see you act. Show us your acting a little. Please! - No. - Just a little. Shall I? Turn your heads. Turn your head or I will thrash you. Actually, no one is a born actor, acting comes from within. When the hero is happy, his acting is different. He is different with a girl in a romantic scene. The villain arrives and... Hey, will you go or shall I hit you? On the knees... And the punch! You... takes the heroine and leaves. - And motion! - It's emotion. It's the same thing. The mother is dying. And the son is crying. Mother. Mother, don't leave me and go. - Look, have tears welled up in my eyes? - No. They will now. Mother, you gave me birth. Now you want to leave me alone? Look, tears have welled up. The next dialogue. You bore me in your womb for nine months and now you are... - Look, tears have welled up. - Yes. Don't go, mother, don't go! - Look, tears. - Yes. If I shed too many tears it will become over acting. - Right said. Right.- Wow. - Who are you? - Kapoor. - Aaj Kapoor. - Raj Kapoor? He used to be. I am Aaj Kapoor. People don't know me normally. They only know the actors that I've groomed. Who brought Govinda from Virar? Who brought Sunil Shetty from Udipi? Who brought Akshay from Bangkok? Who brought Fardeen from Juhu to Jungle? Me! Aaj Kapoor has seen you today. Tomorrow, the whole world will see you. Come and meet me at Mehboob studio tomorrow. I'll make your life! Tomorrow. Am I drunk? But I am not saying in a drunken state. Listen you! I don't understand one thing. If you are such a big man what are you doing in a place like this? Where does one find a diamond? - Where? - In a coal mine. To find such diamonds, I have to visit places like these. No, don't shoot Sapna! - What is he saying? - He says don't shoot. I think his father-in-law is standing there. Sultan Bhai, don't do that. - Khalid Mohammed. - Khalid Bhai, don't do that. You act well. Ask him if he is missing his wife or not. - Are you missing your wife? - Yes. No! Don't cut Sapna's hands, please! I beg... Hello! How much money do you want? I ask how much money do you want? - Chopra. Who are you? - Who am I? If anything happens to my daughter then I will not spare you, understand! Look, if we don't get our money on time then we will kill your daughter. What? Next time if you interfere between us and Prakash then you will find your daughter's corpse on Juhu beach. Hello! Hey, you have wasted enough time. - How much money do you want? - Have you forgotten? 25 for you and 25 for us. 50 in all. Okay. They are asking for Rs.1 crore. Rs. 1 crore! - Hello. - Hello, I.G. office? If you have called up the I.G., that phone only will ring not somewhere else! Please give the phone to Bunty. Bunty? Bunty, who? Bunty! Badrinath, your I.G., give the phone to him. Yes sir, I'll give him the phone. Who are you, sir? - I am Pinku speaking. - Pinku? Who is Pinku? Are you giving him the phone or not?! Yes, sir. - Sir. - Yes, tell me. Sir, a call from some Pinku for you. - Pinku? All right, connect me. - CONSTABLE: Yes sir. I.G. Badrinath speaking. Bunty! Bunty, I am Pinku speaking. - Pinku? - Pinku... Oh, it's you! Where have you been? Bunty, I have a problem. I know. If you didn't have a problem, you wouldn't have called me. Have you even bothered to call even once in these five years? Come and meet me first. Bunty, my daughter has been kidnapped. - Who, Sappu? - Yes, Sappu. And they have threatened that if I inform the police they will kill her. - No, nothing will happen to Sappu. - But Bunty... I said nothing will happen to her. Trust me. Tell me how all this happened. There are two ways in which one can become a hero. Start as a junior artiste doing small roles. Then become a hero. Mithun Chakraborty. Or directly become a star, like "Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai." Hrithik Roshan. What do you want to do? You tell me. - What? - Hrithik Roshan. Then invest Rs.25-30 lakhs and produce your own film. Will that much money be enough? I will take the balance amount from brother. - Who brother? - Brother Jhamu. More than half the Hindi films are financed by him. He's a special friend. Rs.30 lakhs will be yours, and Bhai will invest Rs.70 lakhs. The film will be made in Rs.80 lakhs. Net profit Rs.10 lakhs. - How much will I invest? - Rs.30 lakhs. - And Bhai Jhamu? - Rs.70 lakhs. - How much will the film cost? - Rs.80 lakhs. Then the profit is Rs.20 lakhs. Sorry, account mistake. Don't try to act smart with Aslam. Rs.20 lakhs! What do we do now? - You'll have to start an office. - Start an office. We don't even have Rs.10. - What to do now? - Why do you need Rs.10? Don't we have to feed her something? We are used to being hungry. We'll have to ask for an advance from Prakash. You will ask for Rs.10 from Prakash? Rs.10? We'll ask for Rs. 2000-4000. Have you gone crazy Rahul? If you ask for an advance from Prakash he will think we are street hooligans. - Our entire plan will get upset. - Correct. - There is one solution. - What? - Aslam bhai. - Aslam bhai. Yes. Have you returned the money you took from him earlier? No, but you don't worry about that. The moment we get money from Prakash I will clear Aslam Bhai's account. You are encouraging me, but can this face achieve stardom? 100 days it will run. Such a face has never been seen in the industry before. These days, one who looks different becomes popular. I don't understand what you are saying. What I'm saying is... Despite having Shah Rukh why did the public like Hrithik? Why? Because a man gets fed up of old things and starts liking new things. I don't understand. They are getting everything from Hrithik that they aren't getting from Shah Rukh. Change, range, item, flexibility. You are right. Why does the public watch Hrithik's film more than Shah Rukh? - Right! - Yes. Both are sweet. If Shah Rukh is sugar, then Hrithik is jaggery. Nowadays, people want jaggery, and you are jaggery Bhai. You are jaggery Bhai. Sugarcane type of jaggery, Bhai. - Sugarcane's type! - All right, Bhai. Now I understand that means even the public is fed up - of seeing the same old faces. - Yes. They want a new face. Right. The public has seen the hero become a goon. Now the public will see a goon become a hero. - So when will you break the coconut? - What? When will you start? - Start. - Aslam Bhai! - What is going to start, Bhai? - Hey! - Bhai is going to be a star. - What are you saying? - Congratulations, Bhai! But no celebrations. - Something... - Hey Kaliya! - Yes? - Have you turned white? - No. - Speak louder. - Yes. - Go and get a carton of beer from Shetty. - Wow! "Aslam Bhai!" "My Aslam Bhai! "Aslam Bhaii! Aslam Bhai! Aslam Bhai!" "Spectacles of Dubai, shorts of China, and Irani tea" "Aslam Bhai!" "Aslam Bhai!" "Aslam Bhaii! Aslam Bhai! Aslam Bhai!"

From the shop next door? But I eat only Domino's Pizza. Hey! You are talking too much. You are annoying me. I think we will have to do what we did to Meena, Neena, Tina and Reena. I think we should chop off her hands. No, we will chop off her hair. No, we are goons. Not barbers. Okay, then we will chop off her nose. - Ears. - We'll chop off her cheeks. Shut up! Shut up! Move that knife away. Don't eat if you don't want to, but don't shout. The way she is looking at me, its like she'll eat me up right now. She is hungry anyway. Rahul! - Anjali! - Rahul! I will go and check. - Hi. - What happened? - What? - What is this? Sweeping I was sweeping the floor. - I heard a girl screaming. - Girl? Yes. Yes, oh yes. Harry's girlfriend has come. One of our gang member has come. She is a lady killer. But why is she shouting? Because she lost her dad. - Your dad. - What? - I mean, is he down stairs? - Yes. Then go back quickly, or even he will come upstairs. Harry told me you had gone to call me. Phone? Yes, I did call you, but your father picked up the phone. Okay! - hey, listen! - Now what? Why are you getting annoyed? There are only a few days left. Did you find any job? It is in process. It will be done. Now you leave. Bye! There are two bedrooms here and two bedrooms upstairs. There is also a small kitchen and bathroom. Only two three rooms other than this, that's all. All right, sir. You don't take any tension. Choose a colour from this and tell me. My men will come and begin the work. But I want the job done in cheap. I will charge you very reasonable rates. Okay. What are you doing, father? - Getting the house painted. - Painted? Why? Because your marriage is approaching. Listen. Father, you had promised to give Rahul one month. He is trying his best, father. Even I am only making arrangements for your marriage. If Rahul manages to do something, you will marry him or else you will marry someone else. Father! Throw your things out tomorrow. I am getting the room upstairs painted from tomorrow. Understand? All right. What all right? I've told him 100 times. - Rahul. - Yes, Anjali? Rahul, the way father spoke to you... Why should I feel offended about what my father-in-law said? What happened about your getting a job? I'll get one. But when? After my father gets me married to someone else? - Before that. - Rahul, there is very little time. I know. Thereafter, you and me will be together forever. - Rahul, I... - Even I am not joking. I wonder when you will do it, how you will do it. Darling, I will do anything for love. - "Will live or die!" - "Will die!" - "Will do or pay" - "Will pay" - "Will live or die!" - "Will die!" - "Will do or pay" - "Will pay" "Will hang himself!"

How are you bringing the money? I have a brown briefcase. There will be Rs.500 notes in the briefcase? I haven't seen them. All right, whatever they are. Just come quickly. All right. - Dad. Where did he go? - Master has left. - Left? - Yes. Stop smoking! You have any problem? So you stop breathing. Harry, God has not given you a nice face, at least talk nice. Oh yes, you are very handsome indeed! Why don't you try doing films? - Yes, why don't you try? - That is what I am telling him. - Who are you? - Sir, do you want anything? - What is the time? - The time is just right, sir. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from a working woman to a college girl. I can offer you the best women. What do you say, sir? - What will we get? - Special girls, sir. - Special girls, sir. - We are not interested. Everyone is interested, sir. Don't be embarrassed, sir. I will send you a new girl, a beautiful one. We said we are not interested! I think they are interested in each other. - Hey! What did you say? - Nothing, sir. Hello sir, I am inspector Suraj Singh speaking. Yes Suraj Singh, tell me. Sir, I followed Mr. Chopra. He has come to Gateway of India. Very good. Keep a watch on him. My sight is fixed on him, sir. Even if he moves a little, I will fire. No, Suraj Singh no firing. Sir, please don't worry, I will handle this case. Rahul, you had told him India Gate, hadn't you? - Harry, it's Gateway of India. - I know. - But why hasn't he come yet? - How do I know? Hello. Zubeida, you have not gone yet? Look, I have taken money from the customer. Go right now. I will speak to you tomorrow. Hello sir, I am Suraj Singh speaking. I think the kidnapper has come. So, what do you say, sir? - Where is the kid? - Kid?! - Yes, kid. - Hey, you are asking for a kid? I asked where is the kid? I have brought all the money. Oh all right! You'll get the kid. Why are you getting so desperate? - Is the kid all right? - Yes, she's fantastic. - Then bring her. - Here? If not here then where? There is a risk of the police coming here. - Come, let us go into the room. - In the room? - Yes, come to the room, come. - All right. Come sir. Don't feel embarrassed. That is how everyone feels the first time. It will be the first time even for the kid as well. - Everyone feels shy the first time. - He is the one! - He is the one. - Sir, I am not at fault, sir. This old man told me he wanted a kid. - Hold him, I'm just coming. - Sir, I am not at fault, sir. Yes, sir. Hey, leave me. -Hey, shut up! Inspector, my daughter's life is in danger, please do something. Don't worry, you go home. We'll investigate and let you know. - All right. Thank you very much. - Please leave. - He's the one! - Yes, yes. Rajiv Chopra, you are a businessman. Wonder how you manage a business worth millions. You don't have any brains. When they had said that they will meet only me why did you have to pick up the bag and run like kids? I made a mistake. Not a mistake, it was foolishness. You are foolish! Mr. Chopra, we took that man to the police station and interrogated him. But we realised he is just an ordinary pimp. Excuse me, who asked you to come here? I did. I made a grave mistake. When Prakash got up in the morning and did not see Sapna, he was worried. - Even I got worried, and then Bunty. - Bunty? I mean, your I.G. - I am sorry. - Where is your daughter? - Grandmother. - Doctor. - Her grandmother... - The doctor... Anyway, what difference does it make. - Yes. Oh. Excuse me. Hello. You stupid man, do you think we are fools? We waited three hours for you. Where were you? Where were you, darling? We were so worried about you. Why are you addressing me as darling? - Is someone standing beside you? - Yes. I know you are with grandmother, but you should have called. We have understood your problem. But what about our problem? You will get the money. You want to buy Mr. Husain's painting, don't you? Daddy will give you the money, don't take tension. Look, we are people who give tension, not take tension. - Tell us when you'll pay us. - Even I am as desperate as you, darling. But what do I do? I miss you so much. We want cash! If we don't get it on time you will miss your wife forever, understand? No, don't get annoyed, darling. We will meet in the evening. - Sure? - Absolutely! Bye. He chewed my brains with all those dialogues. Give me a glass of buttermilk. Everything is all right, there is no tension. We are sorry to have bothered you. - Daddy, tell him. - I will call Bunty and speak to him. Thank you very much for your co-operation. All right Mr. Chopra, I take your leave. - All right, bye. - Thanks. Was it Sapna's call? Are you dreaming? Because of your stupidity they are now demanding Rs.2 crores. Rs.2 crores!! - What happened, sir? - Dad! Sir, shall we close the case? No. Then open it? Yes. But sir, they were saying... What do we do? - Do we keep a watch on them? - Yes. The old man is fishy. So what if he's a new hero? Once he comes on the screen he'll create a sensation. No, this scene is for overseas rights. For music rights, extra money will be charged. Yes, send advance. All right? Yes ok. Congratulations Aslam Bhai, I have sold one territory. - I didn't understand. - I don't have time to explain. Come, let us do the casting. Whose music do we take? - How about Dilip? - Dilip?! A.R. Rehman. His name was Dilip first. I asked him to change it. Hello yes Dilip, Kapoor here. How are you? How is sister-in-law? Fine, right? I have heard that you are giving the same kind of music in every film. Be careful, this industry is very fickle. You have to record four songs for me next month. One minute. - Do you dance? - Yes. Add one "Chaiyya Chaiyya" type of song. No, we won't shoot on the train this time, we'll shoot on a bus. Yes. All right, I will send the director. Okay bye. - Who is the director? - Suraj Aditya Johar Bansali. - Four directors?! - Yes. Four in one! The potent of four films in one film. Actually, since this is your first film I don't want to take any chances. I don't want to take any chances. I have even registered the title of your film. Super hit! Was that the name of the film? It is a box office report. The film's title is "Hum dil waalon ko bahut kuch hota hai sanam." Like it? Everything is finalized now. What about the heroine? Heroine? How about Aishwarya Rai? - Aslam Bhai and Aishwarya Rai - What a combination! Am I right? - Is this Aishwarya's house? - Have you seen it? - No. - This is Aishwarya's house. I got this deal done. I am very close to her. - Hey, where are you going? - To her house. Have you gone crazy? You are a big hero, the hero of a big film. How can you go and meet the heroine? You'll degrade yourself. I will go to her with an advance. I will book her. Then her make-up man will come and call you. Give me the bag. - Be careful. - I do it everyday. Sorry. "Forgive the mistakes of the eyes" "Forgive the mistakes of the eyes" "They keep staring at you" "What the lips want to say" "they say that to you" "Forgive the shyness of the eyes" "They hide when they see you" "What the lifted eyes could not say" "The lowered eyes are saying that" "The eyes..." - Who is it? - Is Aishwarya Madam there? She has gone to London. Who are you? - I have come here with Aaj Kapoor. - Aaj Kapoor? Who is he? The one who is with the money inside to sign her. To sign her? With whom? - With me. - With you? - Yes. - Get out! Please! Please try and understand my point. Everything was going according to our plan. The money was lying right in front of me. How was I to know that daddy would take the money and go? Do you understand what I am trying to say? All right, all right. Have you brought the money? - What? - It will take one more day. What do you think, don't we have anything else to do? I know you two are very busy. But for this one day I will pay you Rs.50 lakh instead of Rs.25 lakh. Rs.50 lakh? Rs.25 lakh for you and Rs.25 lakh for you. You are not joking, are you? You think I am joking? My wife is in your custody. How can I joke with you in such a situation? We don't want more money. Give us how much you had told us. Just a minute! Khalid Bhai, let us go aside and talk. Excuse us! - What is it? - We are getting 50 instead of 25. What will we do with so much money? We'll think what we'll do with it later. We were going to get the money today, but did we? - We'll get it tomorrow. - Look Harry, did not like this man on the first day itself. Besides, we were going to commit some petty crime. This this is going beyond limit. Rahul, it is just a matter of one day. Rs.50 lakhs is not a small sum of money. Even if we work all our lives we will not be able to make that much money. Why don't you understand? Bhai is very angry. I have pacified him with great difficulty. You also explain to your dad that if there is any problem again... No, there won't be any problem after this. Thank you. - Now leave. Go! - Thank you. Murthy is going to start the painting from tomorrow. So? Where will we keep Sapna, have you given a thought to that? Why are you getting so worked up? - We will keep Sapna somewhere else for a day. - But where? No water should be mixed in the paint. Mix oil. Understand? - Wait! - Hello uncle. Good, it's that mattress. Where are you taking it? Outside. Are you going to sell it? Want to get married indeed! You don't have a job, nor do any business and want to fall in love! Gradually, you will have to sell everything. You are mistaken, uncle. Looking at your faces, who will not be mistaken? Good for nothings! - Harry, put it down. - Hey. What is your problem? - Rahul? - You keep quiet. This is my mattress. Whether I sell it or throw it in the sea, it is my problem. You read your paper. If the paper has not arrived, I will get it for you. If you want to do something else to kill time, I will call Sonu and Guddu. But don't ever bother me again. You have given me time. I am trying my best. Let's go, Harry. I am not lazy. Let's go! What is this, Rahul? Where are you taking this and going early in the morning? - Harry, just put it down. - No, don't put it down. Anjali, he is in a very bad mood today. I'll explain it to you later. Hello, excuse me. Hello, listen. I think we gave her too much chloroform. She's not dead, is she? What place is this? Your new home. You will stay here from today, understand? I will not stay here, I want to go home. You will not go anywhere. Here's your cornflakes, pizza and Diet Coke. Eat or don't eat, but please don't bother us. Quiet! Quiet! I am noticing since morning, you are in a bad mood. What is the matter? The job should have taken only five hours yet nothing has happened. Wonder how long this will take. How long will we run around with this poor girl? And her husband... how do we trust him? Just think about it! What kind of a man gets his own wife kidnapped? Either the police has come to know or his father-in-law has refused to give the money. We have done something very wrong, Harry. Why don't we take her back to her house? Look, Rahul, what you are saying is absolutely right. But if we had not done this, what else could we have done? I don't care about myself, but what about Anjali? If we don't get the money, we will not only lose our house but you will also lose Anjali. She will leave for her husband's house and you will be shedding tears for her. Look, I want you and Anjali to get married and I also want tears shed, but I want Murthy to shed them. It is only a matter of tonight. Murthy shedding tears?! We will spend the night here itself. She was creating a scene. That is why Bhai killed him. If she had not screamed, she would have been alive. It's okay, at least we got some gold. How much the old woman was bleeding. Right? All that blood splashed on my face. She was 80 years old. How much longer would she have lived. It's good she died. - All the money has been arranged. - Then bring to us. We got the money! We hit jackpot! Get up! - Get up! - What happened? - What happened? - Our money has been arranged. - Come, let us tie her up. - Yes. Get a rope. Stand up, please! Why are you'll tying me up? I will not run away. I get tired standing. - Tie it. - I was sitting comfortably, why are you'll tying me up? Sorry. Before leaving, I wanted to tell you something. You may not believe me but you seemed like my sister to me. Yes? Yes. I regret whatever we did to you. We were wrong in doing so. We scolded you, tied you up, made you cry, scared you. We also threw cold water on your face. But we had no other option. We are sorry. Yet we tried our best not to give you too much trouble. Please forgive us. It's all right. Actually, even I was a little too demanding. I know kidnapping was done for money. So how could you have got Diet Coke for me when you didn't have money? I hope my dad gives you all the money. - Hey! - Thank you. Have the brother and sister finished talking? Shall we leave now? Your husband will come and pick you up in two hours. - Let's go. - But where are you going? - Sorry. - Listen. Please don't go. What will I do here alone for two hours? Listen, stop! Please. Hello! - Who are you? - Who are you? - Who were those two? - But who are you all? Want to know anything else? As promised, here is your money. Rs.50 lakhs. Rs.25 lakhs for you and Rs.25 lakhs for you. But just a minute, is Sapna all right? Khalid Bhai made her his sister. - What is it? - The rent. You were right. Love cannot fill one's stomach. Sapna! Here is a Kanjeevaram saree for you. - It is your favorite colour. Sapna! Sapna! Buy new clothes for yourself, and a new fridge too. Sapna! Sapna! Prakash. - Go. What are you doing here? I saw your car while I was passing by. What are you doing here? I had come to see a plot here. Daddy and I are thinking of constructing a five star hotel here. A five star hotel? Here? Why, do you have any problem? No, I don't have any problem. But why were you shouting Sapna's name? Out of happiness. I want to give this news to Sapna as soon as possible. - Can I leave now? - Yes, you may. Sir, a five star hotel and here? - Why, do you have any problem? - No, sir. I think we are wasting our time on this case. That is what I thought from day one. Sorry, sir. - Hello. - Rajiv Chopra? - Yes, speaking. - Your daughter is in our custody. Come to the ruins behind Gandhi park with Rs.3 crores. Rs.3 crores? But I have sent Rs. 2 crores with Prakash just now. - You fool! That was another gang. - Another gang? I don't have time to explain. Get the money quickly or I'll behead your daughter and send it to you. - Where is Sapna? - Sapna? Yes, Sapna. Where is she? What do you mean by where she is? She is where we left her. She is not there. What did you'll do with her? - Hey! - Tell me the truth, what did you'll do with her? - We left her there only. - Shit! I made a grave mistake by trusting you both. - Tell me, where my wife is! - Prakash, listen. Rahul, what's going on? Harry, he is saying Sapna is not there. If she is not there then where did she go? Rahul, Harry, what is going on? Who are you people? - Who are you? - Just a minute! You are mistaken. Hold on, hold on. My name is Harry, and he is Rahul. We are paying guests here. We have not even paid the rent since the last six months. And Rahul and Anjali... Shut up! I don't care! I want my wife. - Where have you hidden her? - Have you gone crazy? We got our money, so why will we hide her? It is very simple. You'll want more money. All right, you will not accept like that. Hello! Shit! - Someone has actually kidnapped Sapna. - What?! And they have asked daddy to come to the ruins with Rs.3 crores. Oh God! I think Sapna has fallen into big trouble. Oh shit. All this has happened because of me. I am such a fool. Prakash, even we are responsible for what has happened. We will also come with you. "Will do anything for love" Rahul, where are you going? Someone has kidnapped Prakash's wife. Prakash? Who Prakash? - I will explain you later. - What? Sapna! My dear Sapna! Sapna! Papa! - Sapna, dear - Papa! - Papa no, no Leave me! - Hey, shut up! - Leave me. Papa leave me. - Hold her. Give me the bag. - Take it. - Give it to me! Can I take my daughter now? I am sparing your life, you should be thankful. Your daughter will remain with me. Look, please! I have given you the money now. - Please give me back my daughter. - Take him away. - Please, please! - Papa I will come home. Who is that? What happened? Bhai, someone is throwing stones. Leave me. Whose this? Go and check there. - You go, I will take care of her, go. - Papa, save me. You'll go and check outside. - Leave my daughter alone. - I'll take care of him, you'll go. Stop there. You go this way, you go there. Go that way. Shankar! What happened? - Hey Nandu, did you find anyone or no? - I am searching Bhai. Bhiku! Where have you all gone? Why isn't anyone answering me? Say something. Hey Nandu! Papa! You broke my leg! - Hey Harry! - Aslam Bhai? How come you are here? The one who tricked me about making a film I broke a bottle and shoved it into him. The police saw me. Now the police is chasing me. That is why I am hiding here. What are you doing here? You are threatening me with a knife? Harry! Shankar! Nandu! Bhiku! Speak up! - Shankar! Where are you! - Boss, here condition is very bad. Boss, everything is all right here. - Abdul. - Yes? - Did you find anyone? - Yes... Raise your hands and come to the boss. Rahul! Nandu! Bhiku! Where have you all disappeared? Hey Bhiku, Raja! At least someone give me a reply. Hey, shut-up! At least someone give me a reply. - Nandu! - Leave me. - Shut-up! - Please let me go. - Bhiku! Have you all gone dumb? - Please let me go. Abdul! Raja! Hey, don't come here. - Prakash - Don't come closer or I will kill you. You keep quiet! Stop there! I said stop there! Stop there! I said stop there! Move! Hey, don't come closer, I will kill you! No. If my wife gets even a scratch, I will chop you to pieces! This is your last chance, leave her and go away. Or don't say later that you weren't given a chance. Hey! Prakash! Prakash! Move! Move! Give me way. Come. Move back! Give me the bag. Pick it up quickly! Quick, move, go. - Dad! - Don't move! If I hear you move, I will kill you. Move! Hurry! - Sapna. - Prakash, stop. He will kill Sapna. But... We will have to think of something. Hang on. Wait, we'll have to think of something. - Oh God. - Quick Rahul, think of something. What can we do? He has... - Anjali, you? - After you left, I was worried so I brought him along. Move! Mr. Chopra, are you all right? - Papa. - Sapna, my daughter. And these goons had kidnapped you? No, I mean, even they did, but the first gang was different. You mean the first gang was another one? - Yes. - Who were they? I cannot recognise them because they always wore masks. And who are they? I don't know. They are my friends, they came to help me. - Come on. - Aaj Kapoor fooled me. I even paid him money. He knows everything. Four songs were planned with me and Aishwarya in Switzerland. You know about the "Chhaiya Chhaiya song" on top a train? We were planning to do it on top of a bus. We had even discussed two songs with A.R. Rehman. Ask him. We even selected hit directors Sooraj, Aditya, Johar, Bansali so that we make a good picture. If this had not happened the movie would have been completed by next year. Sir, bless me. Look, sir, no one is born a goon. I... I ask him if you like, sir. Acting runs in my blood. I even showed my acting. I am not a goon, I am only human, a helpless human... Where did you catch this mad man from? Take him away! Sir, you are right, I have gone crazy. Aaj Kapoor ruined me. Sapna, I don't understand. Please tell me properly what happened. I will explain it to you. Those who kidnapped me first their names were Khalid Mohammed and Sultan Ahmed. "We are ready to do anything" "We are ready to do anything..." Take care. Go slowly. Everything will be all right, don't worry. If you stay in hospital for one or two days, you'll feel better. And I will give you an increment of Rs.400. Don't worry about the hospital bill, I will pay it. Son, please forgive me, I misunderstood you. Don't say that, dad. Son, I want you to take charge of all my companies from today. No dad, I only want to work with you. Most certainly son, why not? - Dad, this is my friend, Harry and Rahul. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Hi. I am very grateful to you two. I wonder what could have happened if you'll had not helped. - You're most welcome. - Dad, - both are very honest and qualified. - Qualified? If you don't mind, I'd like them to work for us in our company. - Come, dear. - Dad! Of course, why not? - You don't have to ask me. Of course they are most welcome. - Thank you. - So, Mr. Chopra? - Yes? - I take your leave. - Okay. The moment I have any news on Khalid Mohammed and Sultan Ahmed, - I will inform you. - Thank you. - I will not spare those two! - Thank you very much. Come on. If we don't say it now, we will never be able to say it. But what will happen if we say it? Sapna and daddy will never trust me again. Neither Murthy nor Anjali. And we will be back on the streets. What if we don't tell them? Sapna and daddy will remain happy? And even Murthy and Anjali. And even we three. "Oh Lord" "Oh Lord" "That happens that which just happens" "Nothing happens in that it happens" "That happens that which just happens" "Nothing happens in that it happens" - "That has happened to me" - "That has happened to me" - "Oh Lord" - "Oh Lord" - "Oh Lord" - "Oh Lord" "Oh Lord" "That happens that which just happens" "Silently something disappears" "That has happened to me, Oh Lord" "Oh Lord" "Oh Lord"
