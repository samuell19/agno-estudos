MAN (narrating): The world is full of complainers. But the fact is, nothing comes with a guarantee. Now, I don't care if you're the pope of Rome, president of the United States or Man of the Year. Something can always go wrong. And go ahead, you know — complain. Tell your problems to your neighbor. Ask for help. And watch him fly. Now, in Russia, they got it mapped out so that everyone pulls for everyone else. That's the theory, anyway. But what I know about is Texas. And down here, you're on your own. WOMAN: Gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for our first anniversary. MAN: Uh-huh. Figured I'd better leave before I use it on him. I just don't know how you can stand him. Well, I'm only an employee. I ain't married to him. Yeah. WOMAN: It's just — I don't know. Sometimes I think maybe there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally? Or is it maybe me, do you think? MAN: Listen, I... I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on. I don't want to know. But I like you. I always liked you. What are you gonna do in Houston? WOMAN: I'll figure something out. How come you offered to drive me in this mess? MAN: I told you. I like you. WOMAN: I never knew that. MAN: Well, now you do. WOMAN: Hell. - Stop the car, Ray! - (tires screech) (engine off) You know that car? No. What's the matter? I don't know. I just think maybe I'm making a mistake. What was that back there? Back where?

Yeah. - I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor. - Yeah. What do you want to do? What do you want to do?

I want you, uh... to go fishing. - What? - Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done. You just find a way to cover that money.

All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's show our appreciation for Lorraine up there. Registered nurse from Bolton, Texas. How 'bout it, gentlemen? Yeah. - Thanks, Meurice. - Anytime. You don't have to worry for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday. (whispers) He's in the house. He's in the house. - What's the matter? - Could've sworn I heard something. Door's locked. There's nothing there. Well, I guess we wouldn't have heard anything if it'd been him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal, Ray. - Huh? - Uh-huh. He told me once himself. He said to me, "In here, Abby. In here, I'm anal." Well, I'll be damned. I couldn't believe it myself. Me, on the other hand, I got lots of personality. Marty always said I had too much. Course, he was never big on personality. He sent me to a psychiatrist once to see if he could calm me down some. Yeah? And what happened? Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him. I don't think you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly. Well, I never saw him again, I can tell you that much. I said, "Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?" What'd he say? Nothing. He's like you. He doesn't say much. Thanks. Except when he doesn't say things, they're usually nasty. - Mm-hmm. - And when you don't, they're usually nice. - Do you ever get tired? - Huh? Oh, yeah. I guess. Uh-huh.

The money. Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very, very careful. Have you been very, very careful? Of course. Nobody knows you hired me? Don't be stupid. I was not about to tell anyone. We have to learn to be discreet, to trust each other. For richer or poorer. Don't say that. Your marriages don't turn out so hot. - How did you cover the money? - It's been taken care of. And the less you know about it, the better. I made a call. It'll be all right. I must've gone money simple. A murder like this, too risky. Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
