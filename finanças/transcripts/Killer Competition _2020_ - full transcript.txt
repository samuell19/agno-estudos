[fantastical music] [dramatic music] [tense suspenseful music] [sighs] so now what? [ominous music] we need to tell the police. Tell them what? We've still got nothing, nothing to clear us. W-what other choice do we have? Whoever created this website did it from here so that they couldn't be traced. [car honking] oh my god! [uplifting music] okay, stop stressing, just write what you feel. [knocking on door] come in. Hey kiddo. Just checking in on you. You know you've been up here all night. [sighs] yeah, midterm week. And this... [mom] mm still working on your essay? I'm just so worried about saying the wrong thing that I can't say anything. Huh. Well, I know how hard you've been working for this. Ever since you and dad told me about westbridge and all the amazing times you had there, going to college there is all that I have dreamt about. So if it's what I wanted for so long, why can't I just decide what to say? Just be true to who you are and say that - yeah, thanks. - Okay I'll just give it a rest for now and do some studying. Yeah, a little perspective never hurts. Also, popcorn, your dad and I are making some. - Sold. - Oh good. Come on. [mr. Sheppard] some of you obviously didn't do reading or failed to comprehend... Thomas. Good work, Nicole. As always. [gentle piano music] better Sarah. Keep it up. [mr. Sheppard] now as we contine our discussion on Julius Caesar and its present day parallels... [bell ringing] remember, your midterm is in two days and it will consist of everything we covered this semester so far! So study! [uplifting music] I don't get it, - I put in same effort you do... - Really? Because every time we study, you're texting some guy. Well, all work no play? Come on. You're gonna go check it again? I got to know where I st and. You're obsessed. [Sarah] what's the word? Any exciting new changes? Maybe some hot gossip? [Nicole sighs] still a four-way tie for valedictorian. Let me guess... Victor, Jenna... And Ryan, all 4.0s. What are you so worried about? Your grades are like - perfect, it's actually kind of annoying. [gentle music] westbridge isn't exactly cheap and... My parents can't afford it. So graduating number one is the best way to get the scholarship I need to pay for. Worst case, there are other schools? But there's only one westbridge. I'll see you later. [tense suspenseful music] what's that? That's westbridge's decal. I figured you more than anyone would recognize it. Obviously I know what it is. Why is it in your locker? [sighs] kept hearing you rave about it so I looked into it. You were right, it's a great school. Specialized in business so I decided to apply. Already sent everything in, just waiting on my acceptance. Y-you know that that's my dream school... And? [suspenseful music] and you know how selective they are! They only accept like... 300 students a quarter and they pretty much never accept two students from the same high school. Guess you should make sure you apply some backup schools then. How could you do this? There are thousands of other colleges that you could get into, why would you pick mine? Guess you shouldn't have raved about it so much until you got in. Enjoy life at your second choice. I can't believe that he would do this. [Sarah] I can. It's victor, when has he ever thought about anyone but himself? Well you dated him. Oh my god, don't remind me. I should've never mentioned westbridge. So stupid. I've been working so hard, and he's ruining it for me. So let's ruin it for him. How are we supposed to do that? Midterms are tomorrow, right? Big chunk of our grade for the quarter? If victor happens to do poorly before westbridge looks at his grades and makes their final decision... He's one of the smartest students in the school. I doubt that he'll blow his midterm. What if we make sure he does? How? It's not like we can change his test scores. Says who? [tense suspenseful music] what are you talking about? We swap victor's test for one that doesn't get every answer right. He won't fail it but he won't ace it, which knocks down down his GPA just a little bit and keeps you boop (chuckles) at the top. That'd be cheating. Oh and guys like victor don't cheat? He doesn't deserve this. Oh and he deserves to go to westbridge, your dream school that you've been talking about since what, junior high? How would we do this without him finding out? 'cause it'll be in his handwriting, forged to look like he did it. I don't know, this doesn't feel right. Is it gonna feel right if he's at westbridge next fall and not you? Besides, it's not like victor won't end up in great school anyways. His parents will make sure of it. He just won't be at your school. And let's face it, guys like victor, deserve to be knocked down every once in a while. It'll teach him some humility. [sighs] okay. How are we gonna do this? First, we're gonna need a sample of his handwriting. Don't we need his locker combination? Well we gave it to each other while we were dating so we could pass secret notes. It was kinda cute. [tense suspenseful music] [Sarah] got it. Okay now we just need a notebook. Okay, just hurry. [bell ringing] there's nothing here. Just close it then. [victor] I'll see you later man. [grunts] - oh my god. - Nice, smooth move award. [Nicole] out of the way, jerk. Next time, watch it. Nice! Okay we just need a copy of the test which you'll get tomorrow. Wait, why me? Because mr. Sheppard will never suspect you. All right, here we go. Please take a test and pass it back. [suspenseful music] mr. Sheppard, we need one more. Pass that back, please. You may begin. [bell ringing] all right, pens down. Everyone line up in a single file line and hand 'em in. [upbeat suspenseful music] good luck, ladies, not that you're gonna need it Nicole. [upbeat music playing] where you going? Your mom and I are about to binge some more episodes of snack wars. I need some new ideas for the bakery. Sarah and I are gonna do a little study sesh. We won't be long. Aren't midterms over? Yeah, I just want to stay sharp. How's the essay coming? It's coming just, not finished yet. Well, if you need a fresh set of eyes. Yeah, thanks, I'll definitely take you up on that. Mmhmm. Be careful, honey. [ominous music] [Sarah sighs] voila. Oh my gosh, it looks exactly like his handwriting. I know, genius, right? Listen, maybe we should just forget about this. Are you kidding me? Don't get cold feet on my now girl. Well there's chance that victor might not get into westbridge and I will. And we're just ensuring that happens as it should. Okay. Come on, let's do this. Okay. [tense suspenseful music] [Nicole] okay. I rigged this today before we left school okay. [Sarah grunting] okay. [dramatic ominous music] [eerie music] okay, what about the security office, won't it be locked? It will but we're not getting access to it. Instead, we're gonna reboot the system. Shouldn't we just turn it off? We can't without them knowing but if we reboot it, they'll think it tripped from a power surge. How do you know about all this? Remember that summer my parents sent me to computer camp and it was so boring? Well, turns out I learned more than I thought. We're gonna have about three minutes before it reboots. That's it? That's all we're gonna need. Are you ready? Set the timer. Okay, three, two, one, let's go. [loud boom] [clicking] [eerie music] dispatch, this is unit four. Looks like there's some sort of power surge over at the school. I'm gonna go check it out. [upbeat ominous music] how much time do we have? Two minutes, 10. It's not here. Check the drawers. Okay, okay. It's locked. That's gotta be it. [epic ominous music] here. [Nicole grunting] wait, he'll notice. [ominous music] [upbeat suspenseful music] this is why you're valedictorian. Okay come on come on hurry. Okay we're fourth, here's second, third, fourth... Oh here, I got it, I got it. Okay, switch. Okay, okay. Okay quick come on, come on, come on. It's stuck. [Sarah grunting] [drawer slamming] [Sarah] okay let's go. [ominous music] [Nicole] come on. [eerie music] [footsteps] [footsteps getting quieter] [upbeat epic music] [Sarah] go, go, go, [Nicole] okay. [panting] - Come on, come on. - Okay. Okay. [laughing] I can't believe we just did that. Congratulations, girl, you're going to westbridge. [laughing] oh gosh. [uplifting music] [Donna] so I was thinking of just a classic apple with the original cut. - [rick] yeah I like it, I like. - [Donna] okay. [Donna] yeah I'm gonna do it this way. [Nicole] morning. - [rick] morning. - [Donna] morning, baby. Did you finish your essay last night? Not yet. Why do you ask? You're just, you're acting different, happier, like you've got this burden off of you. She's right. [giggles] well of course she is. [Donna] yes. I am, feels like everything's gonna be all right. Well sure it will, you've worked hard for it. Like I always say, that pays off. Yeah. Made you a plate. Eat. - I gotta go, - no! Sorry. Bye! I have to say I'm very pleased. [gentle music] [mr. Sheppard] excellent work, Nicole. [somber music] really Thomas? [bell ringing] all right, ladies and gentlemen, enjoy your day, get out of here. [victor] this is wrong, all right, this is not my test. That's your name at the top, yes? Y-yes. [john] and your handwriting? Yes, but... Then that's your test. But these aren't my answers. I know all this stuff, you know I do. I-I'll prove it, I'll take it again right now. That's against school policy. This will crater my GPA. [mr. Sheppard] victor, I don't know what else to tell you, that's what you turned in. [victor] no it's not, okay, that's what I'm telling you, okay I didn't do this. What are you saying? Someone else wrote it? I-I don't know, maybe. We all have to deal with setbacks in life consider this a lesson and embrace it. [victor] you know what, screw you, your class sucks. [suspenseful music] oh great, you. Are you okay? I... Heard yelling. Yeah, yeah, no, everything's great, yeah, for you. My future just got flushed down the toilet. What are you talking about? This. And I didn't even do it. Congratulations. Looks like you'll be valedictorian after all. Victor, I-I... [knocking on door] hey. Hey. How's it going? Um, it's okay. Yeah? You barely touched dinner. You sure everything's okay? Yeah, I'm sure, it's... It's just school stuff. I'm just not sure what to write for this essay still. Hmm, well maybe I can offer some sage mom advice, huh? Let me see that. All right, let's see, uhh, construct an essay in your own words, that conveys the high standards of morality and character that make you an ideal westbridge candidate. [somber music] well that should be easy, talk about yourself, what makes you so deserving. Yeah, thanks, that's a good idea. I'll have to give that at try. Okay, you know you've been really focused on this. Maybe you just take your mind off of it for a bit. Sometimes that's where you find the best solution. Nicole, if there's something that you want to talk about, we're here or if you just need us to listen, we can do that too. Well, I promise that I can, I don't know about your father. It's just school stuff, I promise. Okay. Well the offer still stands. Okay, tell me what's wrong. It's that obvious? How long we been married? Well, something's going on with Nicole. Going on? There's something that she's not telling us. She wants to but she's not. Well if she's not telling you... A mother can tell these things, trust me, we know. [suspenseful music] we raised her right. When she's ready, she'll come talk to us. Gotta trust her. [gentle suspenseful music] yeah. Yeah. [Nicole] hey. Good morning, miss valedictorian. [giggling] are you okay? You look like you barely slept. I'm gonna tell them what we did, that we swapped victor's test. What? Why would you do that? Because it was wrong. Okay I don't know what I was thinking but this isn't me and I have to fix it. It is you. You did this, we did this. I'll keep you out of it. Okay I'll tell them that I did it all alone, all of it. [somber music] Nicole, think about it, if you do this, everything you worked for will be gone, you can kiss westbridge goodbye. I-I know. And for what? Why would you throw it all away, for victor? You think he would do the same thing if the roles were reversed? - I don't know. - He wouldn't. The victor's of the world will be just fine, they always are. You think it matters if he goes to westbridge or any other ivy league? It doesn't. He still has daddy's money and all the connections in the world. I don't care. I have to make things right and I'll deal with whatever consequences there are but I can't keep living like this... Nicole, don't do this. I don't need you to understand. Okay I just wanted you to know before I did it. But like I said, I won't mention you, I'll take full responsibility. Fine, it's your future you're throwing away. [bell ringing] Mr. Sheppard, what's going on? It's awful, victor miller took his life last night. What? I know, it's shocking, no one wants to believe it. [tense somber music] n-no, that can't be. It's always hard to understand when something like this happens apparently he left a note and mentioned a dip in his grades and the fact he wouldn't be valedictorian. They'll be calling an assembly in a few minutes to notify the rest of the students. I'm really sorry, Nicole. [dramatic music] [upbeat dramatic music] Nicole. This-s is our fault, we caused this. No stop, stop, we didn't do anything, victor did. Because of us. [tense suspenseful music] we didn't know he was gonna react like this, how could we? I don't know but we should have. Somebody's dead because of what we did. I know, it's awful, and but over a test, I mean he overreacted. Oh my god, I can't believe this. We have to tell somebody. [eerie music] tell someone what? Th-that we did this, that we caused this. What good would that do? Nothing we say or do can change what happened. And what did we do? We swapped a test, we didn't... Kill him. Neither of us could've imagined that this would happen, that victor was capable of this. Look, no one can know what we did. They'll blame us, you know they will. So we just do nothing? Yeah, not weird at all. I'll just use the other bathroom. [Mr. Sheppard] Nicole. [dramatic music] Nicole. Nicole, principal McCain would like to see you in her office. Get your things and head on down. [knocking on door] come in. [suspenseful music] Nicole, thank you for coming. This is detective Ramirez. [ominous music] detective, am I in trouble? Why would you think that? [principal] the police just have a few questions regarding victor's recent behavior. Please sit. We're trying to get a better picture of things. A guy with a future as bright as victor's... Doesn't make a lot of sense. Yeah, it's awful, still can't believe it. [detective] you knew victor, yes? Um, well, not really. But you have classes together, nearly all of them, all advanced. Yeah, we just weren't exactly friendly. Are you saying you're unfriendly? No, I mean we just weren't friends. We knew each other obviously, we just didn't exactly hang out. So more like a friendly rivalry since you were both competing for valedictorian? I guess. Did you notice victor being bullied at school or on social media? I didn't but like I said um I didn't know him outside of school. And you'd noticed no changes in his behavior lately? No. Just before his death, victor scored unusually low on a midterm which was unlike him. We think that may have pushed him over the edge. He was really upset. So you did notice a change? He and Mr. Sheppard were arguing about it. A lot of students heard it. Victor came to me claiming that wasn't his exam. He believed someone had stolen his test and forged another in his handwriting. Oh my god. [detective] any idea of who might want to do that? No, but like I said, we... You weren't friends, got it. If you think of anything, please give me a call anytime. Must be a lot of stress with being valedictorian, the pressure to maintain your grades, to ensure you don't stumble just before the finish line. Yes, why? Just trying to make sense of things. Thank you, Nicole. [gentle somber music] [Donna sighs] [Donna] I still can't believe it. Oh that poor family. Hey kiddo, we know you've been under a lot of stress lately with grades and westbridge. If there's anything you want to talk about... What your father's trying to say is that none of that is worth your life. You understand? Yeah no, it's, it's not that. I would never do that. Besides, they brought extra counselors to school for that. As long as you know you can always come to us. I do, thanks. It was just so weird seeing victor's desk empty and... The police everywhere. They brought me down to the office, asked me some questions. Wait wait, who did? The principal? And a detective, Ramirez, I have his card in my backpack. Wait, the police questioned you? Was there anyone else there with you? Principal McCain. Did I do something wrong? No, you didn't. You're still a minor. The police aren't allowed to question you without one of us present. They were just asking about victor, so I wanted to help. That's very thoughtful but the next time the police want to talk to you, you make sure one of us is there. Won't that look bad? It's the law. If we have to follow it, so do they. Besides, why would it look bad? -You don't have anything to hide -yeah there's nothing to worry about. [somber music] victor, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. And that this, what we, wh- what I did. You didn't... You didn't deserve and it's-it's my fault. I'm sorry for everything, for not getting to know you more and for always seeing you as my competition. I don't know, maybe we could've even been friends. I know you're never gonna hear this but I just needed to say it just in case maybe you you do. And I want-I want you to know that tomorrow I'm gonna make everything right. I promise. [bell ringing] everyone, please get to class. Uh principal McCain, what's going on? I'm not quite sure. The police haven't told me everything. They just mentioned something about discrepancies in victor's suicide note and similarities in the handwriting. Similarities? On his last test, the one victor claimed is forged. I-I don't understand. Apparently they think whoever forged his test also wrote his suicide note. [suspenseful eerie music] so they think that victor was murdered? Like I said, they haven't told me much. They just showed up this morning with a warrant. You better get to class. - Hello, miss McCain. - Hi. Again, we have Shakespeare utilizing one of his most prevalent themes, that of betrayal. Like hamlet was betrayed by his uncle Claudius and Othello by Iago, caesar's betrayed by his most trusted ally. Here you have caesar about to ascend to the top of the throne. The very top of the political and social strata and he's stabbed in the back literally by his best friend, the last person he would ever suspect. [eerie suspensful music] [bell ringing] [sarah] nicole. Nicole, wait. [upbeat suspenseful music] nicole! [grunting] nicole. [nicole] stay away from me. Why are you being so weird? Are you avoiding me? It was you. You forged the test which means that you forged the suicide note. You killed victor. Oh my god, how could you say that? It was your idea. [tense somber music] to help you. Why would I kill victor? You know once upon a time not so long ago, I cared about him, briefly but still. What would I have to gain? [somber music] it was your handwriting on the test, the same handwriting... No it wasn't. [tense somber music] I scanned his handwriting from the notebook we took and I sent it into some website. You don't think mr. Sheppard would've recognized my handwriting? You don't believe me? Okay fine, I'll show you. [ominous music] okay. How did you know about this? Remember that college guy I dated in the summer? He told me about this website. He said he heard about it from the other students, he said kids that didn't want to write papers used it. He said he didn't write like a single paper all year. Well there's nothing here. There's no way for us to find out who's behind this site. Told you I was just trying to help you. But we have to show this to the police. Show them what? All we have is a website, one we could've built ourselves. There's nothing here that proves we didn't do it. [eerie music] why would they believe us? Because we're not killers. But you had something to gain from victor's death which gives you motive. But I didn't want him dead. So what we just say nothing and let them figure it out? Then we'll really look guilty. [sigh] we need to find out more about this site, who's behind it and then we can bring that to the police. Okay, how are we gonna do that? ? Of course he will, he's totally in love with you. What? No he's not. [upbeat music] hey zach. Uh hey. Hey zach. Hey nicole, hi, uh, w-what's up, how's it going? Uh, we were wondering, you're good at computers, right? We needed some help. Really? Yeah, yeah sure, I can help you. I mean yeah, whatever. Uh, could you take a look at something? Okay. Okay great, let's do it. [gentle upbeat music] didn't take you for a tor user. Yeah, sometimes I like to browse tor when I'm bored. Forging website, huh? It wasn't for me, I didn't use it. I mean I write my own papers of course. Well we think one of the other valedictorians is cheating. So, um, we just, we just wanted to check. Cool. So we need to know more about this website, like who's behind it and its location. Right okay, let me see if I can trace the ip address. You can do that? Yeah, I-I think so. [sighs] okay, they're using a vpn. Uh... What's that? It's a program that reroutes your ip adress all over the world to keep it private so it's harder to trace. So you can't trace it? No, no, no, I-I-I can I just, I, I need more time. I, I'll do it at home. Oh okay, so nicole, why don't you give him your number and then he can call you when he finds something. Would that be okay with you? Your number? Yeah, yeah sure, no problem, yeah. Awesome. [eerie music] [phone ringing] zach? Hey, it's zach. Right, you just said that. Um, I-I was able to get through that vpn... And? I uh, I traced the ip address. It's actually really close by. [ominous music] close by? How close by? Like right here in town. Are you sure that that's right? [upbeat ominous music] yeah, I mean I, I didn't believe it at first either. So I tried it a couple different times, it's definitely local. Weird, huh? So whoever created the website might be someone we know? Sure, maybe. Could you send me the address? Yeah. And you know I-I can come with you if you want, if you need help. No, just send me the address. Yeah okay sure, I'll uh I'll text it over. Thank you, sorry, I just need to do this myself. Uh, maybe another time. Yeah sure, yeah another time, any time really. Thanks, bye. [ominous music] you going out? Uh, sarah's gonna pick me up and we're gonna do a little study sesh at the library. Why doesn't she just come here? It's okay, um, we won't be long. Hold on, nicole, hey, after everything that's happened with victor, I just, I think it might be better if you just stick close to home for a bit, huh? Sarah and I are gonna go together, safety in numbers, right? Um... Don't worry, we'll be fine. Just be careful. - Okay. - Okay. Bye. [door closing] relax, she's a smart girl, she won't do anything stupid. Come on. [sighs] this is stupid, what are we doing? We're doing exactly what you said, getting evidence that proves that we're innocent. But when I said that, I didn't think about us actually doing it. Now it seems kind of dangerous. Well, we need something to tell the police, some kind of proof that we didn't do it. If the same person who forged the test forged suicide note, then they killed victor, right? We'll just see who lives at this address and then bring whatever we find to the police and what we did. Okay, don't freak out but I think someone's following us. [nicole] what? [tense eerie music] that car keeps making the same turns we are, watch. See? It's been doing that almost the whole way. Why would somebody be following us? Why would someone kill victor and make it look like a suicide? Wait, let me see if I can lose them. [upbeat eerie music] okay, they're definitely following us. I have an idea. When I pull over, duck down. [upbeat tense music] what was that? [distant police sirens] you sure this is the right place? This is the address zach tracked the website to. [ominous music] you've got to be kidding me. How many people you think use the wi-fi here daily? A dozen at least. Shhh. So basically it could be anyone. Shh. [sighing] [sighing] so now what? We need to tell the police. Tell them what? We've still got nothing. Nothing to clear us. What other choice do we have? Whoever created this website, did it from here so that they couldn't be traced. [dark eerie music] [car beeping] oh my god. - [sarah] god. - [nicole] oh god. Nicole, are you okay? Somebody just tried to kill us. Hey, you think it was the same person who killed victor? Someone who was willing to kill to be valedictorian. [eerie music] come on, let's go. [eerie music] uh, ryan, um, listen after what happened to victor, I just wanted to say... Pretty lucky for us, right? What? I mean sucks for victor but you and me, not so much. There's less competition now. How could you say that? Somebody we know is dead. Well it's tragic, yeah, but it looks like victor did it to himself. Well what if he didn't? What I mean is what if somebody wanted victor out of the way so that they could be valedictorian? You got something to confess? N-no. Interesting. Well in regards to that theory, how do you know it's not me? [suspenseful eerie music] well I don't but I thought it was worth the risk to warn you. That's softness. That's what's gonna cost you first place. You don't have that killer instinct which is too bad because if it were you, that'd take you out of the running and pretty much assure me valedictorian. Well, there's still jenna. Jenna, are you kidding me? Not a threat. It's not in her either. It was nice talking to you. Look, I'm just trying to warn you. If somebody did kill victor, then they want this bad enough to kill for it. Okay, I'll be sure to watch my back. And I suggest you watch yours too, unless you think you don't have to. [bell ringing] nicole, can I have a minute? [nicole] yes. Is everything all right? Yes, why? You just seemed off lately, not like yourself. I'm not sure what you mean. I mean you always have the answers. Lately you seem less engaged, distracted is everything all right at home? It's fine. I guess what happened with victor just rattled me. If you say so. 'cause I seemed to notice your behaviour changing before that. Actually, um I've been struggling with my essay for my application to westbridge. I guess it's just finally hitting me, and I don't know what to say. Writer's block, I get it, and I understand. I was the valedictorian myself. Really? Absolutely. Most students don't understand the pressure that puts on you, the fear that this isn't all you're gonna be, that you didn't peak out in high school? I was a writer, a novelist, still am in my spare time. [laughs] [sighs] there's nothing more infuriating than unfulfilled potential. Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. Um, I should get to spanish. Sure. [ominous music] [upbeat ominous music] [grunting] [dramatic ominous music] [crashing] [ominous music] [driver] oh my god. Where you going? I'm gonna meet sarah at the coffee shop to study. Oh, how's the essay coming? Bye. That good, huh? Maybe a change of scenery will help. [country music playing] [phone dinging] [ominous music] [country music playing] [ominous music] [announcement] all top ranking seniors please report to the auditorium immediately. I repeat, all top ranking seniors please report to the auditorium. [suspenseful ominous music] thank you all for coming. We're sorry for the intrusion in your day. We'd better not get dinged for this in attendance. Mine's perfect. I'll ensure you don't, jenna. We've gathered you here to inform you that ryan muberick was attacked last night. [dark ominous music] oh my gosh, is he okay? I'm told he will be in time. He's just been put into a medically induced coma to help bring his brain swelling down. Why are you telling us this instead of the whole school? Based on the events of the last few days, we believe someone may be targeting the top ranking seniors what do you mean targeting? We're now fairly certain victor's death wasn't a suicide and are treating it as such. And after last night's attack... Are we in danger? I assure you my officers and I are working around the clock and will do everything we can to maintain your safety. Who would do this? Based on what we've gathered so far, ryan was chased by his attacker with a hammer, then pursued into traffic. The eye witness reported seeing someone wearing a black hoodie. We're reviewing all nearby surveillance and traffic cameras hoping to gain more information. Until then, we just have to be patient. It's just a matter of time before ryan wakes up and tells us everything that he knows. You think one of us did it? [upbeat ominous music] that's what you're not saying. That's why you've gathered us here first. You should all consider yourselves persons of interest in this case. Us? Why would one of us do it? You're all the smartest kids in the school, yes? Do the math. Each of you had something to gain from victor's death and ryan's had it been carried through. You think one of us is a murder? We also know that several nights ago the school security system was tripped, reset, long enough for someone to sneak in. We don't know why, yet. It doesn't appear that anything was stolen. In the meantime, my officers and I'll be meeting with each of you one by one to ascertain your whereabouts last night. Let me just inform you that my father is a very powerful and particularly spiteful attorney and if one word of this reaches my college admissions department or intervenes in my acceptance in any way, your department will pay for the entirety of my college experience, including grad school. We'll be as discrete as possible. For now, try not to worry. It's just a matter of time before we catch who's behind this. You can all return to class now and please may I advise discretion? Oh my god. [eerie music] [footsteps] [detective] nicole. Several of your classmates mentioned that you and ryan had an argument yesterday here at school. It wasn't an argument. They said it got heated. Raised voices, something about you warning him? I was worried. Why would you be worried? Well with what happened with victor, how his suicide might've been faked, I thought we had reason to be. I understand you and victor are applying to the same college, westbridge. Yes, but a lot of students here apply to the same school. Westbridge is exclusive. I hear they don't take more than one student from the same high school, some diversification policy they practice. I've heard that. Almost lucky for you then that victor's not able to apply anymore. I'm sorry? I mean, now you don't have to worry about him getting in and not you. Seems like your chances have improved. If westbridge thought that victor was a better match then I would be happy for him. Mind if I check your locker? [nicole] don't you need a warrant for that? Technically, yes. Then we should probably do this the right way. I'd hate for this to get screwed up. Like when you asked me questions without my parents present. Being under 18 and all, which I think you knew. I look forward to meeting them. I'll have somebody set it up. I get it now. Um, get what? Why you're valedictorian. [gentle music] we'll talk soon. [eerie music] okay, what's the big emergency? This, somebody planted it in my locker. It's a hoodie. The same hoodie that ryan's attacker was wearing. And this. [ominous suspensful music] oh my god. Somebody is trying to frame me for all of it. I barely got away from the detective finding it. Okay, we should just throw it out. N-no, then we'll really look guilty. We have to figure out who is behind this and then turn this in as evidence. Okay, put it back in your locker and we'll hide it later. We'll figure it out. [donna] mmhmm, sure, well we can do that. It'll take about two weeks to fill that order. Terrific. Okay, we'll invoice and we'll go from there. Mmhmm, talk soon. [door opens] rick, is that you? [somber music] nicole, why are you home so early? Baby, what's wrong? - Mom. - Aww. Shhh oh, it's okay, it's okay. Whatever it is, it'll be okay. Shh, nicole. And now somebody's trying to blackmail me. They put the hoodie and the murder weapon in my locker. We have to tell the police. Mmhmm. Tell them what? That I sabotaged victor with a forged test? They're gonna think that I killed him. Your father's right, if we go to them, it will look better. [somber music] there's nothing to prove that I didn't do it. And they have no proof that you did. If they had any, you'd already be under arrest. Nicole, you should've come to us earlier. I know. I was scared, I'm sorry. I just wanted to stay number one so that I can make you guys proud. After everything that you've done for me I didn't want to disappoint you. That's exactly what I did. Baby, we are proud of you. Nothing will ever change that. How can you say that, after everything I just did? Well, you definitely made a mistake. You think your mother and I haven't made mistakes? As long as you learn from it, it has value. Nicole, nothing in this entire world should ever make you compromise who you are, okay? Nothing is worth that, certainly not graduating at the top of your class. [knocking] are we expecting anyone? No. [eerie music] good afternoon, mr. Ward, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind bringing nicole down to the station. We have a few questions we'd like to as her. Um, sure, could you give us a couple seconds? [rick sighing] you ready kiddo? Yeah. That was taken from a camera behind the school the night the security system was reset. I broke in [ominous music] to change victor's test. I wanted to make sure that I got into westbridge so I swapped his test with a forgery. Why'd you wait so long to come clean? I wanted to but then victor killed himself and I felt guilty and then they said that it wasn't a suicide. Where'd you get the forgery? From a website. Show me. No, that can't be. I-it was here a day ago, I swear. Zach saw it. He traced it for us to the library. The library in town? Yes, it's internet address led us to this that's a public site with free internet which means anyone who visited the library could've created it. Well that's when someone tried to run them down. Run you down? And you didn't think to report that? I- how could we without incriminating ourselves? We were trying to get proof that we were innocent. Let me explain how this looks, you confessed to breaking into the school to swap victor's test, which you admitted you had forged, through a website that mysteriously and conveniently no longer exists, a forgery that matches victor's suicide note. I know how this looks but, I... Do you? You had motive and opportunity. Where were you the night of ryan mulbrick's attack? At a cafe studying. Can anyone corroborate that? Sarah was supposed to meet me there, but she got hung up at work. O-okay, that's enough. No more questions until we have a lawyer. I can. I was watching her from my car parked across the street. That's convenient. Well when your daughter's not acting like herself and another one of the top ranking seniors suddenly dies, you tend to become a little overprotective. And you were there the whole time? I followed her from home. And when she got up to leave, I went home. Nicole arrived a few minutes after. Can we have a word outside? Yeah. [rick] come on sweetie [tense ominous music] [upbeat suspenseful music] [upbeat eerie music] if you're doing this to protect your daughter, don't. Excuse me. Doing what? Giving her an alibi. If you're lying, you'll just make it worse for all of you. There are ways for us to find out, employees, security cameras. [donna] you think that I'm lying? I can corroborate that she left. I think you'll do whatever's necessary to protect your daughter. Damn right, including parking outside a coffee shop for hours. [dark eerie music] nicole was exactly where she said she was, which means she didn't attack ryan. [ominous music] I'll have some people look into this forging website. Are we done? As of now, you're free to go but don't go planning any family vacations to mexico. Come on. [dark ominous music] I have a guy at the office whose brother's a lawyer. I'm gonna go have a chat with him just in case. Okay. Sorry dad. It's okay, sweetheart, we'll get through this together. See you guys at home. Why did you do that? Do what, protect you? It's my job. Lie to the police that you were following me? [sighs] I wasn't lying. You've been spying on me? Not spying, more like keeping a watchful eye on you. [soft ominous music] I was worried and, actually you should be grateful that I did 'cause you have an alibi because of my helicoptering. How long? Not long, just the other night at the coffee shop and that night that you went out with sarah. Wait, that was you following us? Yeah, until sarah decided to drive like a maniac which had me even more worried. We didn't know. We thought that it was somebody else, the same person that tried to run us down. Well the police are on it now, okay? They have the forgeries and they'll figure this out. This is my fault, sabotaged victor for my own gain. Well your dad's right, you made some mistakes, okay, but if there's anything that I'm absolutely certain of it's that you are not a killer. Who is? Come on. All right, I just need to make a stop for the bakery. It'll just take a second. Want to come in? No thanks, I'll just stay here. [eerie music] [upbeat eerie music] nicole? [upbeat ominous music] -[jenna] have a good shift - [librarian] see you tomorrow. [jenna] thanks. - Nicole. - Mr. Sheppard. Everything okay? [eerie music] you seem on edge. No, I'm just, it's been a weird week. It certainly has. I didn't know jenna worked here. Oh yes, this is sort of her domain, the one place she wields power and she never lets anyone forget it either. No kidding. Yeah, she's typically here when I am. Usually I come to grade papers or for the quiet to write. The walls in my apartment are frustratingly thin. Writing, yes, thank you, mr. Sheppard, I'll see you tomorrow. Sure. [jenna] are you following me? [Eeriemusic] no, I was just... Don't. We're both too smart to play dumb. Whatever you're doing, don't mess with me. No one's getting in the way of my future. Listen, I just... [dramatic ominous music] [voicemail] hey it's nicole, please leave a message. Sorry, I just had to borrow something from a friend. Okay, let's go. [upbeat suspenseful music] no, it has to match. It wasn't jenna. Then who could it be? [dramatic eerie music] of course. Oh my god. It's mr. Sheppard. [sarah] mr. Sheppard, what? I know it sounds crazy but it matches. What would he have to gain from victor's death or attacking ryan? I don't know but the police can figure that out. Okay I'm gonna head back to school and grab the stuff that he planted. I stashed it in my gym locker just in case. I'm gonna give this to the police with this evidence and they can figure out the rest. I'll go, I'll go. You head the police and I'll meet you there. No, this is my fault, I have to fix this. This is my fault too, remember? It was my idea. Besides I live closer. I should be able to get there right before they lock up. I'll meet you at the police station right after. Okay, great and sarah, be careful. Okay. Mom? [rick] hi honey, I'm just running some erran... It's mr. Sheppard, the handwriting matches. Your english teacher? I know it sounds crazy but I ran into him earlier at the library, and he said that he comes there a lot to work which means that he created the website from there. I'll meet you at the police station, okay? I'm headed over now. Nicole, go straight there. Be safe, I'll see you there. [upbeat ominous music] [banging] [banging] [dramatic ominous music] hello? [dark eerie music] [phone dinging] what the hell? [dramatic music] oh my god. [phone dinging] what'd they say? That's all they said? Did she tell you? It was sheppard. I got to call you back. It was her teacher, mr. Sheppard. What? Nicole, she was headed here. [suspensful music] she said she knew who did it and that she has proof. Well she's not here, I haven't seen her since earlier with you. She should've been here before me. [dramatic suspensful music] thompson, put out an amber alert on nicole ward, age 17, missing and possibly in danger. And get an address for one of the high school teachers, a mr. Sheppard. Come on, nicole, answer. [tense ominous music] [phone dinging] [nicole] I'm here. [eerie music] [grunting] [nicole] jenna! Jenna! [upbeat ominous music] [grunting] so where's sarah? [sarah] right here. [dark eerie music] sarah what are you... Not as smart as you thought you were, huh? Sarah. Although you did almost figure me out. That's why I needed john's help to sell my innocence. John? [dramatic ominous music] neither of us expected it, [upbeat ominous music] it just sort of happened. [john] better sarah, keep it up. Now as we continue our analyzation of julius caesar and its present day parallels. At first, I just needed somebody to talk to, somebody who would listen about all my opportunities being robbed from me by legacy kids, kids who don't work nearly as hard but are still given priority. I understood it all too well. I lived it myself. Competing against undeserving offspring who'd been given an advantage all because their parents had attended the same school. And when their grades don't cut it, they buy their way in robbing others of a chance, robbing me of mine. How is that fair? And then we bonded. And well [laughs] we bonded. Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind. Is that what you think this is, love? This is not love. You think this is what I wanted with my life? I was supposed to be more! One of the great american novelists. Instead, I'm stuck here nine months out of the year teaching brats like you and writing essays for lazy college students. My true potential squandered for a lifetime of student debt. But this, the valedictorian murders, as I call it, this'll set me up. A novel written by someone who experienced it firsthand, who wouldn't want to publish that? Finally allowing me to fulfill my true potential. I can't believe you would do this. You framed me for murder. Why should I play fair in a game that's already unfairly rigged against me? I helped you, we were friends. Friends? Did you ever check my standing in the class? Did you ever even ask? No, because you didn't care, because everything was always about you, and every day I had to listen to you whine about your perfect grades. [laughing] but now with victor out of the way and you and jenna, I can finally rise to the top, giving me a future, a chance, one that I deserve. You think that's all it'll take? [laughing] what college will turn me away now, after everything I've been through? That poor girl enduring such emotional trauma, her best friend a murderer and she didn't even know it? What is wrong with kids these days? The pressure of being number one, she just cracked, officer. When you started to figure things out, we had to hasten things. [dramatic ominous music] first you took out victor, then ryan, then the sweatshirt and weapon were found in your locker, then poor little jenna here she figured you out. But the guilt was too much for you. So you had to end it for yourself on the very same stage you were about to give your "look at me, I'm so great" speech. You think that they'll believe you? Well they won't. Oh, they will. You made sure of it. [nic deserve and it's my fault. It just needs a little editing before it goes viral. You stole that? You made it easy. Your password, westbridge2024, I mean you could've tried a little harder. You're a bitch. Oh ouch, true, but not a total one. And since you won't be here to step on the stage to say your valedictorian speech, I'll let you say a little something. Any final words? I think it's been at least three minutes [tense suspenseful music] oh. Bet you didn't know that they installed more security cameras after the attacks. You're going to prison, not college, and even if you kill us, you're caught. [upbeat dramatic music] okay, hold on jenna. Somebody help! Freeze sarah, drop it. Drop it. [grunting] nicole told me how you got in. Nicole! Hey! [grunting] no, no, no, no, what was I supposed to do? - She seduced me! - Yeah yeah. She seduced me! Right. Nicole! [dark eerie music] [grunting] I got you, I got you, I got you. [panting] it's okay, it's okay. It's okay, you're okay, it's ok. [gentle music] thank you. Wait what about sarah? They got her. Baby. [emotional music] [gentle upbeat music] dear westbridge admissions committee, I struggled with this essay for a long time because I wasn't sure what to say, what I needed to say to ensure my acceptance and enrollment. I was so afraid of saying the wrong thing that [sighs] I couldn't say anything. I'm not afraid anymore. The last few weeks have taught me not to fear what the future brings, no matter what that might be. [uplifting music] mainly because I've made so many mistakes. Because I wasn't true to myself. It is my distinct honor to introduce this year's valedictorian, jenna mckay. [audience applause] congratulations. Thank you. I'm writing this to inform you not to accept me to westbridge. It was a hard lesson to accept but one I needed to learn because it made me find my true path. Nicole ward. My competition is not with others to get into the best school but with myself to be the best person that I can be. And that can only be achieved through my choices and my actions. Graduating class, please move your tassels from the left to the right. [principal] congratulations. [audience applause] [upbeat music] okay, that's the last one. Although I'm not sure how you're gonna fit this in that tiny room. I'll manage. Don't, if you cry, I'll cry. I won't cry. Thanks for always looking out for me. We always will. Love you. I never wanted you to follow our path, I wanted you to find your own. I'm proud of you. Sure you're gonna be ok? I'm gonna be great. This is where I'm meant to be. Yeah. Okay. Come on, mom. [uplifting music]
