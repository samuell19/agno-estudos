Quick! She's here! Quick, hurry up! - Hello, everyone. - Hello. Am I late? No. I'm even early, it seems. So... Is everyone here? Oh, no... I see that... Our own Philippe. - Hello, Jeanne. - Hello. May I ask why you're in such a good mood? We're happy to see our favourite manager. Good. You'll smile less when you see the Décopril figures. We'll have to be more... aggressive and tenacious! Danou wants you. - Now? - It's urgent. - Sounds like trouble up there. - I'll go. Get started. HIS SPRING, HER WINTER Come in. Hello, Jeanne. Thanks for coming. Have a seat. Sit down. I'm listening, Maillet. I'll be straight. The parent company's made a decision. Staff at the south-west branch is being reduced, and... - "And"? - 10 jobs are going. - That many? - Yes, 10. Under the circumstances, it's the only way to keep the branch running after the heavy losses, due to generic drugs. "Heavy losses". Don't exaggerate, Hugues. Latest results aren't... Right. No need for such pessimism, Hugues. Thing's aren't rosy. But it's the right decision, Jeanne, and I'm sorry. Jean-Pierre, we know this should have happened a year ago, and I myself... You what? I've a plan to make the redundancies go smoothly. May I know who's leaving? I can't tell you yet. It's not yet official. Is that all? Oh! Wait! There. You have a good team, it seems. - So, that's it? - Yes. - Do you know who's going? - They wouldn't say. It's not official, right? Don't worry, we'll fight. I'm not worried. I must tell you... I couldn't say with Maillet there, but you're on the list. - Me? - Yes. I'm really sorry, believe me. But you're probably the luckiest. Or rather... The least unlucky. Given your age and the relocation rules, you'll be able to take early retirement, and get your leaving bonus, of course. You're relocating... It's a chance for you, Jeanne. It won't be so bad, believe me. Good night. The fish will be pleased. That's the third in a week. They'll get the texts down there. Where can I phone from? Do you have a mobile? Well, me and mobiles... There's a phone kiosk over there. It's my office, but you can use it. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Sophie, it's Mum. No. I'm still at the office. Yes, I know it's late. Tomorrow lunchtime? OK. I'll collect him. You can count on me. Yes... Lots of love, darling. You too... Wait. Wait. It's... It's unpredictable. I'll... It blocks sometimes. - There. - Thank you. - Sure you're all right? - Yes, fine, thanks. Hello. Oh, hello! Your first night with no phone wasn't too hard? It was. But I made an effort... Sorry, I must have seemed ridiculous yesterday, right? No. Sometimes people blow it. I saw you had a car. Are you going back to Bordeaux? Yes! Oh, yes! I'm leaving... Oh dear! In 5 minutes. Could you handle a stowaway? I've a son, Louis, who lives abroad. The rebel of the family. At 18, with a culinary arts diploma, he went off to Asia. He's in Vietnam now. I tried to stop him. Well... in my own way. Now he's opened a restaurant, and is doing well. His taste for adventure doesn't come from me. - Is Vietnam nice? - I've never been there. Even to see him. I'm a disgrace. Stupid, isn't it? Am I boring you? Yes. But as you drive like a maniac, it helps to pass the time. - Like a maniac? - We ought to be dead by now. I've a daughter too. I need 2 hours for her. Spare me! Not your daughter. The bypass will be jammed. I don't know where to go. - Any idea? - No. - I'll go north. - OK, go north. - Where shall I drop you? - In the north. OK. At least you're not complicated. There. It was nice talking to you. - It was mostly me who... - So... Thanks for the adventure. You're welcome. Normally, you say: "The pleasure was mine." "The pleasure was mine." I'm Pascal. And you? Jeanne Dorval. Jeanne. Excuse me, I'm sorry... Hi, Grandma. How are you? How did school go? You OK, Grandma? Yes, I'm fine. "Oh yes, I know it's cold "That the sky is all... askew "I know that neither..." - "Primroses." - "Primroses "Nor lambs are here yet "The earth spins; spring will come back..." - "on its green horse." - "On its green horse "What's a wood without woodpeckers, A garden without lilac? "Everything passes, even..." - "Even winter." - "Even winter." - Grandma. - Yes, darling? I'm coming to live with you. Isn't it a good idea? I don't know. Yes, a very good idea. But it's not possible. You have a mum and dad who'd be sad if you left them. Sorry, Mum, there was an accident just as I was leaving. Weekend emergencies. And the boss came 2 hours late. I sent loads of messages, you didn't answer. I lost my phone. And the landline... - Have you eaten? - I can't stay. I have appointments very early. - I'm not sleeping here? - No. You need a pee? Go on. I can't do it for you. Then we'll go. Mum, I must tell you. It's all gone wrong. - What's the matter? - Guillaume has a lover. I'm almost sure of it. Sure? Do you have proof? Loads of proof. Absences, lateness, poor excuses... He's always texting. If guys could lie, it would be easier. I tell you, he's seeing someone. I don't have to tell you, you know all that. So I'm really pissed off. But don't worry, I'll survive. - Did you tell your father? - What? He'd probably defend him. With Dad, it's just: "Hi, how are you? Life's good." Get your things, Lucas. Say bye to Grandma. OK... Goodnight. - See you soon. - Yes. - Grandma has a boyfriend. - Nonsense. I saw him. He kissed her in the car. Grandma has no boyfriend. She's too old for that. Go on. Well, anyway... No, no, no. Let them come. OK? Either they redeploy everyone, or.... - For you, Jeanne, it's different. - No exceptions, Hélène. OK. What I think is, they'll leave it drag on, put us on minimum hours, and that's when we'll attack. Sorry, I think that's the wrong way round. They've been preparing for months. Maillet's face tells you that. We can't wait, we must ask for a meeting, concrete proposals. We won't give in. Or we're lost. You're right, honey. Jeanne Dorval. - Mum, am I disturbing you? - No. Can you have Lucas tonight? - Tonight? Sure. - You've saved me. I'm sorting things out. He's confessed. It's a client. We're going out to get things clear. If it goes too far, I'm doomed. - You're right, honey. - I'll forgive him. - Is that a good idea? - Yes. It's the best way. If I pressure him, he'll go. Are you OK? You don't sound it. Redundancies. They'll probably give me... early retirement. When did you hear that? A few days ago. It's not official yet. That's great! It's good luck for you. You'll be free. I know someone who'll be happy. I love you, Grandma. I love you too. Bye, Grandma. *Arcachon Bay No, you can't. Sunday we'll go fishing. A day with no TV'll do you good. So I can't sleep over with my friend? I said no. Come on, let's go. Thanks. Oh, no! Move! I brought the clothes you wanted. I hope they're OK. Thanks. How do you feel today? My head hurts, and my ankle, mostly. You really frightened us... You're lucky it wasn't worse. All that to avoid a dog. You should have hit it. Just keep going, never mind the dog. That's what I say... Sure you didn't lose consciousness, or feel dizzy? No. I wanted to move you to my ward, but you're OK. I called Louis to reassure him. - Dad'll come this afternoon. - No need to worry them. You have to take it seriously. I asked for an ankle X-ray. You don't want complications. Thanks, but... Isn't it hot in here? - Let's get some drinks. - Now? Aren't you thirsty? Unless you want to stay with Grandma. Go on, darling. - See you in a bit. - Yes. Come in. Hello. It's OK, nothing... serious. That's what the nurse said. - It seems... - How did you know? Well... An original way of visiting people. You drive like crazy, don't you? I saved a dog. Yes, true. I saw you on the floating dock yesterday. I was with my son and his mother. My ex. When I saw you leave like that... Well... I was pleased to see you. But it was tricky for me. You see? You don't have to explain anything. I didn't want you to think that... To think what? Will you leave now, please? That's him, Grandma's boyfriend. You know who you remind me of? Erich von Stroheim, in The Grand Illusion. - Mum... - Not very flattering. What were you doing in Arcachon? Seeing a client. How's the car? A write-off? Almost. The mechanic wondered how I could still be alive. Come on. You're exaggerating, Mum. You'll soon be fine. You're indestructible. If you say so. How are things there? I'm fine. It's all going well. Wait, look. Hey, guys! Say hello to my mum! - What do you think? - It looks great. Well done. I'm proud of you. I didn't tell you, but maybe I'll come back for a few days this summer. - Really? - Probably. I'd love that, Louis. - It's been so long. - Yes. Mum, I'm sorry, I have to work. Lots of love, take care. Talk to you soon. Guys, say bye to my mum. Bye, Mum. - Noted. - Thank you. Goodbye. Hi, Jeanne. Good to see you. For the urgent things, I've left you a memo. Thanks, Clara. Thanks. This is the agency's proposal for Décopril. - It's not stellar. - Oh? Thanks, Philippe. I'll read it fast. Well, Jeanne, how will they manage without you? We'll have to train them. - How are you? - Fine. Getting by. Glad to see you're better. My visitors are in zones. A file for each zone... one zone in each file. Here are all the reports, for each visitor, with progress rates. This is confidential. My private business. Not for all to see right now. Each zone has a rating, some are more complicated than others. You know, when they asked me to take over your work, I refused. Removing a post, rearranging things, doesn't solve everything. It's extra work for those left. Anyway, I've asked around. Even those not concerned are aware it's just stalling for time. It's not fair. You're easily the best. I'm disgusted. You're sweet, Marie. I'm touched by your words. But early retirement is an opportunity for me. - You waiting for my grandma? - Yes. She's not collecting me, my mum is. It sucks. Where's your grandma? 21, rue André Malraux. Don't tell her I told you! There she is. - Give Grandma a kiss from me. - Yes. - You're late. - Sorry. Traffic jams. Come. Jeanne? Hello. - Are you better? - Yes. Tell me... why did you kiss me in the car? I wanted to. And because of... your charm, your attentiveness, your nature, full of life. Your finesse, your look, your capacity for joy, and also... Also, you're very beautiful. I have to go. I'm dining with friends. "Friends"? Of course. Bye then. Bye. It's not... very handy. Yes, Sophie? I was getting up. I'm going to the doctor's. They'll take the strap off. Oh, good. I'm glad for you. Couples counselling? Ouch! Yes, it's a very good idea. If he agrees, that's good. Yes, you're right. No, everything's fine. I must go. OK. Lots of love, darling. So, is my coffee good? Yes. Very. Bye. Thank you. Jeanne! Jeanne? Can I ask a favour? Martin's not free to go to Toulouse. You're the only one who can replace him. You know how important these seminars are. What a nerve! Making me retire and asking this? Please, Jeanne. Do it for me. No. Sorry. Find someone else. No one else but you can replace him. Please, Jeanne, do it for me. Martin will brief you, you'll be fine, Jeanne. Sales of painkillers have increased. For example, Tramadex, in combination, has increased by 76%, Tramadex alone by 36%. Consumption of Pralixel is up by 91% and codeine combined with Pravidex is up by 96%, so we can congratulate ourselves. Yes? I can't talk for long. It's lovely to hear you, anyway. A cruise? By boat? Excuse me, I'm not... Jeanne Dorval... I must go. It's my presentation. Jeanne Dorval? You all know the example of Décopril. A bold campaign, expected to push up our sales. Aggressive marketing is a natural reaction, which often makes our management forget this: our clients are not as stupid as they seem. They're better informed than we think. This tends to get forgotten, especially now, when profitability concerns lead to staffing decisions which are quite mysterious. Not so mysterious. It's easier to fire 10 people than argue with shareholders. Isn't it true? We have talent here, but one thing's lacking: courage. We should let our researchers know. One pill to make our managers courageous. Makes you think. Makes you laugh too. So they keep going. Courage often goes with imagination. One courage pill twice a day, there! Hey, you're radiant. What's going on? Nothing. I feel good, that's all. It was funny. - Surprised? - Not at all. I love your new hairstyle. Is it retirement that's done this to you? - How d'you know? - How d'you think? You could have let me know. You don't always have to face things alone, eh? - It's not too bad, is it? - I'm getting used to it. - When do you leave? - I still have 2 months. Unless I get a reprieve. Don't count on that. Are you booked, or shall we eat together? I'm free. You were hard on the management. What came over you? The courage pill, of course! I always say studies aren't everything. He's doing well. Asia is the future. He knew it. But as for Sophie... I'm surprised Guillaume accepted. I don't agree. Sometimes there's no choice. - If they decide... - Yes, but... When you want to control everything, you know what happens. It's normal Guillaume strayed. That's a man's view. You complain about her and defend her. It's odd. OK. Pierre... I have some news. Good news? I don't know. I really miss you, Jeanne. I miss the affinity we shared. And well, I don't know... I sometimes think... It's stupid! I think... one day, we'll get back together. Well, I've something to tell you. I don't know how. OK. Promise you won't laugh? OK. I've met someone. I think I'm in love. I saw some men since we divorced, but nothing serious. But this... "But this"? - There's something. - Is he a paraplegic? Stop it. It's crazy... He's much younger than me. - How much? - 15, 20 years. - Really? - And he lives on a boat. I don't know much about it. It's all so new, exciting... "He lives on a boat"? All I know is, he used to work in events, then he decided to get out of the system. Oh! "The system." Really? Really. The power of publicity, the artificiality of relations. The growing impact of images, blatant consumerism... He didn't feel comfortable. That's it. - He joined an association. - He's a bit of an activist. It's really stupid. I knew you'd like it. The story's quite crazy. I never thought this would happen to you. No. So what shall I do? I'll tell you. Go for it, girl! Seriously? Well. Goodnight, then. Sweet dreams. Thanks, Pierre. I feel better for talking to you. And I had a great evening. That's nice. You should call your wife. She'll worry. Especially if she knows I'm about. Yes, Sophie? Oh no, I can't. I have plans. I'm having a girls' weekend with Hélène. Sorry, but I'm already on the way. Call a babysitter. They aren't had to find. Mind the step. - I missed you. - I didn't miss you. - That dress suits you. - You think so? You brought something more practical? Of course. - Which way? - Here. Mind your head. It's sweet. - Really? - Yes. - You like it? - Yes. It's quite charming. Well, make yourself at home. We sail in one hour. Sorry. - Pascal, I need to get off. - What? I want to get off... - Something wrong? - I can't breathe! Gently! What are you doing? - I must take this off! - Gently. Forgive me, I'm not used to it. Sure? We've just set off. Yes, I'm sure! I hate the sea and boats! I don't like the smell of seaweed! And diesel! I feel sick. Calm down. We'll turn back. Don't worry. Easy now. Pascal, I didn't tell you, but the day we met, I'd just heard I had to take early retirement. I stop in 2 months. I know, it's not... very exciting. - So? - So nothing. Soon I'll be out of things. And I don't see much hope for us. What do you mean? You're a knockout! What will I do in 2 months? Make jam while waiting for you? With your benefits and the boat, and my payoff, we could, I don't know... go round the world. Friends have done it. I know. You wouldn't think, but I'm a real adventurer. I'm sure you are. What did you do for 2 days? Nothing. We visited Arcachon. What else could we do? But what an idea, to go with that guy! He'll dump me soon. Why do you say that? Did something happen? No, but... He talked about himself. He has problems with his son. Apparently, he must find a real job and live in Bordeaux to get custody. - That's his problem. - At least he has a kid. Yes, but at 40, he might want more kids, with someone younger. Don't go so fast. You have potential. Use it all! OK? Make the most of it. Jeanne? - Can I have a word? - Of course. Pleased with yourself? Sorry? - Your speech at the seminar. - I don't get it. You must have enjoyed it at the time, but you went too far. Your words were reported to me. I told the management. Denigrating your boss in public is a serious offence. - Read your contract. - But what did I say? You'll need a better defence than that. I only wanted... Whatever, you'll be laid off till the managers make a decision. I wanted to warn you. You're in danger. You risk immediate dismissal. And don't count on the early retirement. - What? You can't... - I've told you. I'll go to court. You can't do that. I've no more to say, Ms Dorval. Mr Danou, this is Pascal, my nephew. Mr Danou, the managing director. I'll leave you with your nephew. Goodbye. Forgive me! Sorry, but I couldn't... Your nephew? I looked stupid with my flowers. - Admit it, you're ashamed of me. - No! You surprised me. And it was a bad moment. I was just... It's not easy. Jeanne, I think we'd better stop it here. I don't want to get serious if you can't cope. And I don't want to be treated like that. Don't take it like that. I said "my nephew". You could be that. It's no big deal. Yes, it is! And you don't even realize it! I'm trying. I'm not up to it, but if we part, what'll become of me? OK, I was ashamed! So what? Don't dramatize! You're hopeless. If I'm hopeless as well... He's trying harder than he has for ages. He buys me presents, he's at home more... Now I realize I've let things go, recently. I don't say it's my fault, but... After 8 years, things get stale. And the sessions raise many questions. I'm sure, if we try, we can save our relationship. That's what the shrink's for. And she helps Guillaume find words for his feelings. Communication's important, you see. Expressing your feelings. I think I've forgiven Guillaume. This affair probably wasn't very important to him. Did you and Dad think of seeing a shrink? Are you listening, Mum? Mum? Yes, yes. Are the work problems getting sorted? Things are OK. Don't lie. Are you seeing someone? Lucas, get your things. We're going. Why must I get my things now? You do what I tell you. Yes, I met someone. So? - Who is it? - You don't know him. He's... Don't say it's the hospital guy. Yes. No. You're joking. It's him? Does Dad know? And Louis? Do you realize? He's Louis' age. I know, but I think I'm in love. When were you going to tell me? How long's it been going on? I don't have to report to you. I was looking for a time to tell you. Don't be like this. If you knew him... Save your effort. I don't want to know him, you see. Ready, Lucas? - Say bye to Grandma. - Bye. See you Wednesday. See you then, darling. You'll be at the gate? Coming. I hope you're practicing safe sex. Lunch time. It's chicken. You like chicken. - I bet it's organic. - Yes. You want to say something. Is it a new girlfriend? How do you know? When you want to talk, you make chicken and chips. Yes. Well, it's... You're in love. Eat. Hello. Hello, Jeanne. I didn't know you were coming. I just came for my things. Come in. I put them in this box. - As I was moving in... - No problem. Where's my ratings notebook? - Notebook? - The blue ring-bound one. Isn't it there? No. - May I? - Of course. I thought you'd taken it. As you said... - Has Danou been here? - He comes in sometimes. The bastard. Dear Jean-Pierre Danou, Here's the quarterly statement... Enclosed file Dacovi - 1st Quarter Statement Projections Better to do it in my office! Are they there? I'll join you. The Chinese are here. Coming, coming! Hélène, it's me again. Call me. It's important. Hélène? Oh, it's you. You're not disturbing me. Yes, I'm at home. Now? Yes! Of course I'd like to. You look good like that. - Found a job? - No. I saw a headhunter. I got a few proposals, but nothing concrete yet. And you? I've done something crazy! - I must tell you. - What? Hi, Pascal. I didn't expect to see you here. - How are you? - Fine. So, are you back? What's up? Are you getting married? Er... Sonia, Jeanne, Sonia. - Pleased to meet you. - And you. I'll join you. I've been reviewing tenders with Luc. - Remember Luc? - Yes. - You worked with him? - Yes. He recruited me. Remember? I couldn't stop blushing. You really impressed me! - He was very, very impressive. - Really? You're so modest. You taught me everything. They're still as slow here. Excuse me? May I? I'm so thirsty. And what do you do, Jeanne? Me? I... Excuse me. Hello? Who's that? Your dad? Yes, he's here. Here he is. Your son. Hello? Yes, son. I love your name. Jeanne. You're very pretty. You're really charming. And you don't look your age at all. - Can we be friends? - OK. How old do I look? Oh, I don't know. Exactly right. When Clémence left him ? the mother of his son - we had an affair. Nothing serious, but... You're very pretty too, Sonia. Really. Make the most of it now. Here. I gave him your number in case. Good idea. - Nothing serious ? - No, no. What can I get you? The same, please. Is that document genuine? Definitely. An email from the parent company to my boss. Can you use it? It's not official... And I'm not supposed to have it. Whatever it takes, Jeanne! They have no scruples. Now you have something that will scare them, you should use it. Use it to renegotiate your dismissal. Sure about the documents? Positive. Then you've no choice. People use any weapon, and this is a great one. You can't miss the chance. Wish me luck! 2nd floor. So we'll do that. Don't forget my reports for Monday. OK. Very well. Goodbye. Why are you here? You've no right to come here... It won't take long. Depending on you. If it's about your lay-off, it's not decided yet. It's not that. Or maybe it is. I'll get to the point. I've acquired a document, an unofficial one, giving all the profits figures for the branch over the last quarters. The real figures, I mean. Either I reveal them to the press or you renegotiate my dismissal at once. For this information suggests the layoffs are not justified. I don't know what you're talking about. You do, Mr Danou. It's the email the parent company sent you last week about the quarterly results. What email? What results? It announced a 10% increase in sales. Notably of Décopril combined with Décopril Plus. And... where did you get this? The document you have in your computer... and my copy. But those figures are totally false. Besides, you can't understand them. You know this is quite illegal. Maybe. But if I sent them to the press, would they be so fussy about how I obtained them? You'll be sued, anyway. I'll take that risk. In my situation, I'm not scared of that. You're on the wrong track, Jeanne. Some things are not acceptable, like the way you dismissed people. I can also say that Mr Maillet, the HR director you recruited a year ago, started planning these dismissals as soon as he came here. How come the plan was set up a year ago when the profits reported to the shareholders were rising? It was all planned in advance, right? Hugues? Can you come to my office please? Right away. We have a problem. "We have a problem." He was as white as a sheet. I thought he might snatch my bag. I wish I'd been there to see it. It's my round. Excuse me? Thanks. We must plan ahead, keep the pressure up. Yes. Make them panic. Maybe some anonymous phone calls? "Mr Danou, you don't know, but your wife..." Or we all ask for a rise. Thank you. To us, and to love. It's strong! - It reminds me... Remember? - Oh no! Please! No, no! Don't drag up the past. What did I say? Nothing! If I can't talk, why invite me? Your guy reminds me of an actor I love. A Spanish actor. Banderas! That's it. Banderas, the bandit. Oh my... My lovely little Pascal. May I? Wow, that's... That's a lot of muscle! Oh dear... She's not keen to share! Even in hard times. She could help her feckless friend a bit. No? Her feckless friend. It could be fun, no? Better to share a good one between two, than have a bad one alone! Stop it, Hélène. It's not funny. Oh dear! I'm only joking, Jeanne! - Hang on... - A taxi. There's one. Oh, but... He looks... nice. - You OK? - Fine. Why shouldn't I be? Thanks. Bye, darlings. Take care. - See you soon. - Look after her. - Hello. - You won't vomit. Mind your own business. We'll see. Come on! I think you're a bit... She's had too much. Yes. Shall we cross? Oh, yes. - If you like, I'll invite you... - How kind. ...to have a pizza... with these gentlemen... - He looked nice, anyway. - Very. - I left the light on? - Hush! Anyone there? Honey, why are you here? Hello, Mum. Hello. I came to meet him, since you haven't introduced us. Maybe it's not a good time. Are you celebrating something? Hello. - Been here long? - Quite a while. Guillaume's babysitting, for once. So you're the lucky man? Pleased to meet you. My mother hasn't said much about you. You live on a boat, right? - Apparently. - OK. Won't you sit down? But if you don't mind my asking, what do you do, apart from living in a boat? Want my CV? It may take all night. Why not? I need to know who my mother's with. It's new. It's normal. I feel responsible for her. Right, Mum? You look good for someone with no job. Look, Sophie... I'm tired, I need a shower. Goodnight. Where does he think he is. Look, Sophie, it's late. You'd better go home. You must have better things to do. I want to go to bed too. I'm tired. OK, I get it. I hope this guy won't come between us, for... one day you'll have to choose. You're not on your own! You have children. If I can't visit without seeing him swanning around! And you stink of alcohol! I think she's already told her brother. I fear the worst. She can be trouble. Don't exaggerate. Maybe her brother... is less stupid than her. Possible, no? I hope so. Thanks anyway. You handled it well. That looks good. I should have succumbed. - Want to share? - Yes please. Shall I bring a spoon for your mum? You'll see, Victor, the food's good. This is our head accountant. Hélène Lartigues, Victor Ferret. Something wrong? No, no. What's up? Have you lost something? No, no! It's fine. Well, bravo. To cap it all, you make a fool of yourself here! - No need for that! - And your blackmail? - You're crazy! - Is it your business? Did you give my wife these ideas? Your ex-wife's an adult. She doesn't need anyone to defend her. When you live on benefits in a boat... It's madness. You lose track of reality. You're putting us in the shit! Worried about your job? No! Pierre, stop it. Yes, I'm worried. Why wouldn't I be? If one person loses it, all the rest are threatened. I see just one person losing it here. How pathetic! How low you've sunk. Goodbye. Sorry. I don't know what came over him. Well... Your daughter, your ex, soon your son... - I'm going back to my boat. - Seriously? - I'm off to my appointment. - Shall I come too? See you later. Louis? No, you're not disturbing me. The airport? Which airport? Why didn't you let me know? Did your sister phone you? Wait for me at home. The concierge has the keys. Of course I'm pleased! I'm very pleased. Louis, I'll call you back. I can't talk now. Yes! See you later. Answer... Hélène, it's me. I'm off to see Danou. Go to my place. I couldn't get Pascal. Louis's coming. He mustn't find him. If you can go... Hello, Jeanne. Will you get in? - I'm in a hurry. - Really? OK. - Couldn't we go... - Get in. - Go ahead. - Right. I'll be quick. I've talked to the board, and here's our proposal. I'm listening. I'm offering you a deal, Jeanne. It's good for 48 hours. We'll pay you a large sum, in confidence, of course, and you will retire immediately, and of course promise to take no further action. So you want to buy my silence, right? No need to talk that way. Sorry, but that's not what I proposed to you. I asked for the others to be reinstated. Otherwise I'll talk to the press. You can think about it. Stop, please. I'll get out here. Mum. I didn't hear you come in. So? Aren't you glad to see me? Of course I am! How was the trip? Great. I'm a bit tired. Jetlag. - Want some coffee? - Yes, please. - Was it OK when you got here? - Fine. Looking for someone? What? Of course not. I'll change and come down. Have you settled in? Not yet. I thought I'd take Lucas's room. Yes, that's fine. Your coffee. No sugar, as you like it. Thanks. You're looking good. - You think so? - Yes, you look... ...younger. Don't you? And retirement? You haven't said. Is it OK? Yes, it's good. Very good. I'll have time for myself. I haven't had that for a long time. Like that. So it cooks slowly. There. Will you fetch me the vegetables? Thanks. There. Can you finish chopping the cabbage? It's ready. Perfect. We make a good team. I'll lay the table. Wow! That dress really suits you. You think so? So, Mum... Don't you have something to tell me? I'd like you to tell me... I'll go. Good job there's a lift! I hope we're not too early? Pierre was eager to see his son! No, it's fine. - Where's the artist? - In the kitchen. - Shall I take your coat? - Yes, thanks. Thanks. - A lovely dress. - Thanks. - Hello, son! - Dad. What a surprise! You're lucky. - In 2 days I'll be away. - Oh? Hi, Anne. - Hello, Louis. How are you? - Fine. I'll take this off. - There. Hi. - Hi. - You're dressed for the job. - Sure! Professional or nothing. Take a seat. Sorry, I'm late. Everyone's here, right? He could have let us know. I'm too old for surprises... - You didn't know? - No. No one tells me anything, you know that. - But I thought... - What? - Guillaume's not here? - As you can see. Go and say hello to Grandma and Uncle. - Is he coming later? - No, he isn't. We've split. Just before I came here. That's it, he's gone. I'm happy, believe me! - "Gone"? But... - Yes, he's left me. I'll tell you, if you're interested. But it's not very interesting. He was still seeing his lover. While we were in therapy, he was doing it. - Where's the hero of the family? - What's going on here? - Aren't you coming to say hello? - Of course. Hi, bro. You look fit! Tell me your secret, for... Well... Hi, Dad. We were waiting for you, to eat. Louis's made us a feast... You'll see. - Your husband's not here? - No, but I am. - Hello, Anne. - Hello. - Have you changed your hair? - Oh, no... - It looks different. - Really. Take your places. I want a whisky first. I need one. At this point, you need to find an investor. - You're holding all the cards. - Dad... I told you: I like being self-employed. That's a mistake! Have you visited the Imperial City? The emperors' tombs are impressive. - Tombs? - Yes. No, I haven't seen them. I'm so busy. Stupid, I don't have time to see much. - I don't... - It doesn't matter. Excellent. Well done, Louis. Take the recipe, darling. - Excuse me. - Have a drink. It's a bit strong. Really? You think so? I don't do spices. We noticed. Anyway, well done. You've succeeded. I can't get over it. Honestly. At first I was worried, when you left. You mean you were against it. For or against, who cared, but you were against. It's delicious. It's excellent. I'm having some more. More, anyone? That's it, avoid the issue. Men know how to do that. Are you after me, Sophie? How's Guillaume? I'd have liked to see him. Dad left. I was against that too. Really against it. But never mind. Gone? Mum told him never to set foot in the house again. Word for word. Well done, darling. You know how to listen at doors. It's OK. Don't make a fuss. Look at your face! We've separated. You want details? Expecting someone? I don't think so. - Why are you here? - I was just passing by. I thought it would be good to come. Are they all here? The whole family? La famiglia? I'm not sure it's a good idea, Pascal. No, it's an excellent idea. Isn't it? This is Pascal. Excuse me. Jeanne said you were all here. I thought it was a chance to meet you. I hope you like surprises. We love them. - Anyway I felt like one. - Same here. - Hello. - Hello. Anne, my wife. Pascal, Jeanne's friend. Hello. Pleased to meet you. - Louis, right? - You're Pascal. - Pleased to meet you. - Same here. Do have a seat. Have you eaten? I've made a Vietnamese dish. I'd love some. I didn't eat before coming. Right. Don't move. I'll heat it up. Grandma didn't tell me you were coming. She didn't know. Nor did I. Happy, Mum? Now you have two sons. Sorry, but I can't do this. I really can't. You do it on purpose. You spoil everything. Never mind that Guillaume's gone. You make it worse by bringing your man. - Sophie... - Let me speak. Why are you so nasty, Sophie? You're unhappy, but it's no excuse. Yeah, yeah... You know Guillaume left me because of you? Therapy showed me many things about us two. You made me prioritize work, be strong, accomplished... ...independent. But I'm... Not like the image I give, see? I need to be looked after. In my job, too, I look after others. But no one looks after me. - Sophie... - No one. Leave me! It's easy for you. You're far away, you come back and everyone falls on their knees before your crap! Hey? I don't like Asian food! I can't eat with chopsticks. I'm right. Come on, we'll talk about it. Yes? Come on then. Welcome to the family, Pascal. - How big is your boat? - Twelve metres. If I were you, I'd keep it. Don't sell it. These days, you should keep what you have. It's valuable. - It was Louis who invited you? - Yes. Why would you sell your boat to pay rent, and end up with nothing? With a boat, you can go anywhere. With an apartment, you don't get far. See? How about Vietnam? In that case I'll come too. Yes. Maillet, transferred? That's good news! Every one of them? I'm so pleased. Oh, me... I miss you too, a lot. I'll come and visit you. Yes, a family weekend. Yes. Lots of love, Hélène. Lots of love, take care. It wouldn't really take much Maybe just ten years less For me to tell you "I love you" And take you by the hand And stay with you till morning Share your bohemian lifestyle But why should I delude myself? Young man, come, look at me Bastien, say hello. See the wrinkles on my face Bastien, Lucas, Jeanne. - Hello, Bastien. - Hello. Call me Jeanne, if you like. Show him round. - Follow me? - OK. What would we look like? I know what people would say He's so charming What does he see in her? He's in Spring, she's in winter Coming. Tomorrow there'll be someone else That you'll be taking, I am sure To share your bohemian lifestyle It wouldn't really take much Maybe just ten years less For me to tell you "I love you".
