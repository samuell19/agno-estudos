[CROWD CHATTERING] MAN [IN ENGLISH OVER PA]: The white zone is for immediate loading... ...and unloading of passengers only. No parking. [PLANE TAKING OFF] [LOWING] [IN HINDI] If I have to see one more monument today, I'm done for. Let's go home now. [IN ENGLISH] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Would you look at that? What is that? AUNT: That? It's for election campaigns. Stop, stop! I want to get that on my camera. Stop, stop, stop. UNCLE [IN HINDI]: Hey! What are you doing? KAJU: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [IN ENGLISH] Okay, I'm going around and coming back. [IN HINDI] Careful! AUNT [IN ENGLISH]: Hey, careful, Kaju. Uncontrollable. Typical Roy. SALESMAN [IN HINDI]: If your wife has complaints, then startle her tonight. I have the cure for you. It's to increase your might. This oil is for enlargement. To make your life, your daily life, a delight. [SALESMAN SPEAKING IN HINDI] KAJU [IN ENGLISH]: Mom, I can't tell you how much I love being in India. And with the family. I still can't understand why you didn't want me to come. Things are so crazy here and so real, you know? I feel very foreign. Yet sometimes, something tugs at me deep inside. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN DIALECT] -I'm sorry, I don't understand. -[IN ENGLISH] Heads are need to cover. Oh. Sorry. KAJU: It's almost been a month. I miss you. Today we're going to the village, to the place where I was born. [ENGINE STALLING] AUNT [IN HINDI]: Now what? [IN ENGLISH] First the tractor and now this. I knew we shouldn't have come to this far out. UNCLE [IN HINDI]: Arre, wait, wait, relax. Don't worry. I'll just fix it. [ENGINE SPUTTERING] [SINGING] [IN ENGLISH] It's amazing to actually be here, you know? [IN ENGLISH] Yeah. I wish I could remember something. TUKI: Should we go now? AUNT [IN HINDI]: Let Kaju come. KAJU [IN HINDI]: Uncle. [IN ENGLISH] Come sit here. I want to get a shot of you guys for Ma. [IN HINDI] Gran, do you want to say something to Ma? [IN HINDI] Is she here that I can speak to her? [UNCLE LAUGHS] [IN HINDI] Gran, she's going to send this to America. Just speak into the camera. Keya, come quickly. In just one month your daughter's turned my hair white. [ALL LAUGH] [IN ENGLISH] Look, Ma, she finally stopped dying it. GRANDMOTHER: Shoo, you wicked child. But honestly, to have this child with me after all these years... ...it's just so lovely. -[IN HINDI] How much is that? -[IN HINDI] Five rupees. It's okay. Just give me 4. Here's 10. Keep the change. [UNCLE SPEAKING IN HINDI] What's her name? Durga. -[IN ENGLISH] Shall we go? -[IN ENGLISH] Yeah. Come. Oh, you bought a gulaak. Nice. TUKI [IN ENGLISH]: Come on, Kaju, you were so young. KAJU [IN ENGLISH]: You're right. I mean, I was only 3. But seriously, I can't remember anything. -Yeah. Okay, listen. -Hmm? Do you want to come for this party? -No. -Come on, Kaju. It'll be fun. No. I don't know anyone. There'll be lots of people from different colleges. So you'll get to know people. Come on. India's not just villages. It has cities also. -Oh, really? -You should see them. Come, you haven't even met Siddharth yet. -Come, Kaju. Come, come, please. -Okay. Fine. I'll come. [IN HINDI] It's okay, Bela, we'll make the beds. [IN ENGLISH] Good night. So who else is going to be there? Everyone. Siddharth will be there. -Ha-ha-ha. -Yay. Ha, ha. [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHATTERING] [IN ENGLISH] Hey. Are we leaving anytime soon? TUKI [IN ENGLISH]: Why? Curfew's not till 1. -[IN ENGLISH] Are you getting bored? -No, I'm fine. It's just.... Ha, ha. It's part of my Indian education. [TUKI LAUGHS] The sociology of the elite Indian 20-somethings. [TUKI LAUGHS] -I'm missing out on the joke. -You won't get it! [CUP CLATTERS] Oh, hi. I didn't see you. It's nice out here, isn't it? I'm Kajori Roy, by the way. Kaju. [IN ENGLISH] I'm Kabir. Kabir Sehgal. Um, I believe there's, like, a famous mosque around here. Oh, that's the Hazrat Nizamuddin. He was a famous Sufi saint. 15th century. And it's not a mosque. It's a shrine. -Oh, are you a history major? -No. It's just stuff you grow up with when you live here. -You're visiting? -Yeah. I'm from L.A. So I suppose you're doing the whole tourist thing, huh? Camera and all. Exploring the ancient India, the exotic India, the spiritual India. Well, I just want to get to know all of India. The real India because-- Oh, the real India. And, what? I suppose you'll find it through your foreign lens? [SCOFFS] Are you always this quick to put someone in a box? I just want to get to know India because it's a part of who I am. Well, it was nice meeting you, Cabron. Or what was it? Kabir. [IN ENGLISH] So half an hour? Let me ask Mamu what the plan is tomorrow. Um.... Mamu, tomorrow you're practicing for the cultural function, right? Ah. [IN HINDI] Yes. We have to. There are only two weeks left. KAJU: So I was thinking... ...I'd go to the university tomorrow. Because I haven't seen Mom's old college yet, you know? Why don't we go the day after tomorrow? -[IN HINDI] Why? -I'll take you there myself. -We'll go again. -Um.... [IN HINDI] Kaju, the university is far off. [IN ENGLISH] You don't know how Delhi is. You'll get lost. [IN ENGLISH] Maima, I went to Mexico alone. Tell me which bus to take. Write it down for me. -I'll be fine, I promise. GRANDMOTHER [IN HINDI]: Bus? How preposterous! No. Absolutely not. [CROWD CHATTERING] KAJU [IN ENGLISH]: Excuse me, please! Excuse me. Hello? Excuse me, please. WOMAN [IN ENGLISH]: No, but I don't want to do it. I don't have time for it. [IN ENGLISH] Excuse me. [IN HINDI] Um, can you tell me where I can get chole bhature? Is there a good café around here? [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] [IN ENGLISH] Yeah. You can try Balbir's. What you do is just go straight down and take a right. [IN ENGLISH] Okay, good, thanks. [CROWD CHATTERING] -Kaju? -Hey. [IN ENGLISH] Tuki didn't tell me you were coming. Come, sit. Guys, this is Tuki's cousin, Kaju. -[IN ENGLISH] Hey, Kaju. Hi. -[IN ENGLISH] Hi, Kaju. SIDDHARTH [IN HINDI]: Gobind bhai, meet Kaju. She's come from America. [IN HINDI] From America. In my café. My God. It's unbelievable. This calls for a special tea on the house! Pappu, make the number one ginger tea special. Less sugar and use mineral water. KAJU: Thank you. Is this your first time here? No. Actually, I was born here but then I moved to the U.S. when I was 3. I just graduated from UCLA. But then I thought I'd take a break before getting a job or thinking of grad school. It seemed a good time to get in touch with my roots. I mean, Dilli is so intense, you know? Okay, guys, we have to go. Can't bunk Chakki's class. Kaju, see you around. Kabir, don't forget Shake Soc at 3. -Bye, guys. Catch you later, bye. -Bye. What's Shake Soc? -It's our Shakespeare Dramatic Society. KAJU: Shakespeare? Why? Do you have a problem with that? No. Maybe I could shoot it through my foreign lens. Oh, thank you. Pappu? [IN ENGLISH] My good name is Sanjay. Pappu my home name. [IN HINDI] Madam, take one shot of me, please. Pappu. Becoming a film star. Nonsense. I made you Lakshman in the Ramleela and you couldn't say one line properly. -So, madam... -Thank you. ...do you make films or something? -[IN HINDI] No, I just make documentaries. -Daku? Bandits? If you like bandits, let me do Daku Gabbar Singh for you. -It's a brilliant dialogue. -[IN ENGLISH] Okay. [CLEARS THROAT] For miles.... Ahem. For miles around mothers get their children to sleep... ...by scaring them with stories about me... ...the dreaded bandit Gabbar Singh! How many bullets are there? How many bullets? Six, Boss. Six bullets, three men. Very unjust! [LAUGHS] Very, very unjust! [LAUGHS] [MIMICS GUNSHOTS] KAJU: Ha-ha-ha. That was really cool. Thank you. That was nothing. My son, the younger one, is even better. By God, he dances so well. He easily defeats even Shah Rukh-- [IN HINDI] Gobind bhai, can I come to your house to shoot? Why are you pulling my leg? Maybe that's not such a good idea, Kaju. Why not? I think it's an excellent education for her. -Just what she's looking for. SIDDHARTH: I've got an idea. Why don't you take Kaju to Gobind bhai's place. Me. Why? TUKI [IN HINDI]: His name is Kabir. His father is a senior government official. He's doing Economics Honors. He's very bright. He'll be doing an MBA. [IN ENGLISH] How is that even relevant? I hate corporate types. GRANDMOTHER [IN HINDI]: No, no. This boy is right. He'll be the best to show you around Delhi. [IN HINDI] Gran, I can.... [IN ENGLISH] I can go around Delhi just as well by myself. Listen to me, sweetheart. Please don't go anywhere alone. For my sake. Heh. Okay, Gran. But only because I adore you. Besides, this Kabir is such a dork. TUKI [IN ENGLISH]: No, he's not. -He is. TUKI: He's the one who knows Delhi the best. Will you all mind if I ask you something? [IN HINDI] We're all ears. When you wear pants how do you manage to pee? [KAJU &amp; TUKI LAUGHING] [IN HINDI] We don't pee! How can that be? [TUKI SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY, THEN LAUGHS] Don't you wear pajamas? With pajamas you can take one leg out, but with pants you can't. [KAJU &amp; TUKI LAUGHING] [IN HINDI] Down with lockouts! Lockouts won't do! CROWD [IN HINDI]: Won't do! Won't do! [PROTESTERS CONTINUE CHANTING] This is the beginning! The struggle lies ahead! [PROTESTERS CONTINUE CHANTING] LEADER: Raise your voices, workers! CROWD: Raise them louder! Raise them louder! [PROTESTERS CONTINUE CHANTING] LEADER: Raise your voice against the police state! [IN HINDI] So you're making okra? This is Shakunthala. She's an amazing woman. Today she's making okra. And if you ask me.... [CHILDREN CHATTERING] GOBIND: Move! Run away from here! They are crazy! Again the same thing! Ask me who is the neighborhood loudspeaker? Leelavati. And who is Leelavati? My wife. Go and sit there quietly, good children. Heh. The kids have been waiting since yesterday. They've asked me 10 times. "When is Aunty coming? When is she coming?" -I said, "She'll come, she'll come." MAN [IN HINDI]: Good day, Uncle. MAN: Have they come? -Yes, this is her. [UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING] [IN HINDI] It's a good shot, right? How is it looking? Huh? [MUSIC STOPS] [IN HINDI] Oh, no. The electricity's gone. It's the same story every day. Today I've made this dessert called halva after a long time. When his grandfather was alive we used to make it on all occasions. Gobind also loves it. He told me to make it since you were coming. I said today's kids don't like such things. He said Kaju madam is different. I said, as if you know her. How many times have you met her? He said he met you once and only three days ago. [MOUSE SQUEAKS &amp; KAJU SCREAMS] But don't you worry-- It's just a mouse. It's all right. But don't you worry. Eat, eat. I've made it with boiled water. What can we do? No matter how clean we keep it, our neighbors-- Be quiet. Are you going to say everything in one breath? My parents went to the village-- LEELAVATI: Oh, God, the village. Don't talk about it. When we went there for the kids' summer vacation. My father-in-law insisted we stay on there. The children go to school here. Now, tell me, can they study in a village? I put my foot down. "I'll educate the children." I came back to the city. KAJU [IN HINDI]: Whose photograph is that? [GOBIND STARTS TO SPEAKS IN HINDI] That's Balbir Uncle. He was a very good man. Gobind's father used to say that it was a blessing to know such a great man. Sadly, I never met him. You must have seen his photograph in the café. Enough. You've been jabbering like a tape recorder. Without a pause. [WHISPERING] She asked me about the picture, so I answered. Otherwise why would I talk? No. It's not you who's been talking all this time. It's been our neighbor, Mr. Chaddha. [UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING] -The electricity's back. -[IN ENGLISH] You can dance now. Come on, son, come on! Dance now! [IN ENGLISH] We're definitely lost. I don't understand why you had to insist that Gobind bhai not drop us. [IN ENGLISH] All we had to do was walk straight. We wouldn't have been lost if you hadn't tried the shortcut. Wait. I'll just find out. [GASPS] -What? What happened? -Nothing. [IN ENGLISH] Kaju. Is everything okay with you? [IN ENGLISH] Yeah, why? You've been a little withdrawn the past few days. I'm fine. -Sure? -Yeah. -Is it Kabir? Are you falling for him? -Ugh. Oh, don't be silly. Come on. Let's do stretches. -I think he likes you. -Whatever. Come, Tuki. I'm not doing any more. KAJU: Come on. It's just a little bit. Okay, come. Give me your hands. [KAJU CLEARS THROAT] -Okay? TUKI: Okay. Tuki, remember how you were telling me about the villagers migrating to the cities? TUKI: What? When we were coming back from Chandan Hola? TUKI: Yeah. Why? Is that common? TUKI: I guess. I mean, if there's a bad season or something. Why? No, I was just wondering. Hmm. [IN HINDI] Beladi, will you bring us some water, please? [BELA SPEAKS IN HINDI] KAJU [IN ENGLISH]: Thank you. -Okay. -More? -[IN ENGLISH] Hi, Veena. VEENA [IN ENGLISH]: Hi. -[IN ENGLISH] So who won? -[IN ENGLISH] Guess. Guess. Ha, ha. Ah. Long time. How's Rohit? I want Kabir to meet him. Get a feel for the bank. VEENA: Haan, haan, anytime. Beta, you're joining the bank? But you're such a talented actor. -Yes, Kabir has a passion for acting. VEENA: Ah, with so many English films-- Acting is all very well as a hobby, but he has to have a real job to feed himself. And what is this real job we are talking about? [SIGHS] Baba, are you coming for a wash? -Ma, will you order a beer for me, please? -Yes, beta. KAJU: Namaste, Didi. [IN ENGLISH] Hello, Bublee. Hi. [IN HINDI] Do you know what I've got for you? BUBLEE: Chocolate! No, ha, ha. Look! [SPEAKS IN HINDI] [IN ENGLISH] Elephants! [SPEAKS IN HINDI] [IN HINDI] You didn't like them? Guess who didn't like them either. [IN HINDI] It may not be chocolate, but it's elephants! Say thanks. BUBLEE [IN ENGLISH]: Thank you. [IN HINDI] And this is for you. -[IN ENGLISH] Bangles. -[IN ENGLISH] Bangles. [HINDI] For me? You're spoiling me too. [IN HINDI] Do you want chocolate? Come. [IN HINDI] I don't have change. Okay, wait. I'll get some. KABIR [IN ENGLISH]: I have this rehearsal I need to attend very urgently... ...so can we leave? [IN ENGLISH] Sure. I'm just waiting for the change. So, uh, when can we meet again? Day after? KAJU: Yeah. -And where do you want to go? Um, actually, I kind of want to come back here again. Again? But why? I mean, there are so many interesting parts of Delhi that you haven't even seen. And you've done this whole poverty thing. Is that what you think? There's no lack of poverty in L.A., you know. Oh, please. It's not even the same thing. What would you know? First of all, I was born poorer than Bublee. I was born in a village which didn't even have electricity or tube wells. Maybe that's why I'm drawn to the whole poverty thing. And, what? Your mother went from a village to America? My birth parents died from a malaria epidemic... ...which wiped out my entire village. I was adopted from an agency when I was 3. Kaju, I'm really sorry. I had no idea. Thank you. [IN HINDI] Bublee, come, I'll take you home. KABIR: Uh, I can drop you. -[IN ENGLISH] It's fine, I'll manage. I thought you had rehearsal anyway. [SIGHS] [IN HINDI] Give me a small Gold Flake. UNCLE [IN HINDI]: What movie is it? TUKI: Raaz. UNCLE: Raj? TUKI: No. Raaz. UNCLE: Same thing. KAJU [IN ENGLISH]: Isn't that the remake of What Lies Beneath? -[IN HINDI] How many is that? -[IN HINDI] Two tablecloths. Three towels. [IN HINDI] Doesn't it have that Bengali bombshell? Go and see if there are more clothes in the girls' room. [DOORBELL RINGS] Oh, God, who could it be at this time of night? [DOOR OPENS] BELA: Oh, wow, look who's here! -Keya! -[IN ENGLISH] Surprise! KAJU: Oh, my God! Mom? I can't believe it! [ALL CHATTERING] Here's Ma. You should have sent word! [ALL CHATTERING] -Come, sweetheart. -I just can't believe it. Go, go and sit down. She loves giving surprises. I can't believe you're here. AUNT: On which flight did you come? [IN HINDI] Ma, come and sit. -[IN ENGLISH] Sit here, my darling. -Be comfy. Thanks. Thanks. Thank you. [IN HINDI] Wow, this girl has grown so tall. Tuki! TUKI [IN HINDI]: Of course, you've come after so long. [ALL CHUCKLE] -So your case is finished and everything? -[IN ENGLISH] Case is over. And you locked up the house? Sweetheart, I locked up the house efficiently. [IN HINDI] Ma, this girl thinks only she can get anything done. Thank you, Bela. AUNT: Really, even after all these years you look exactly the same. [ALL CHUCKLE] -[IN HINDI] You're the one who's beautiful. AUNT: Oh. But tell me, what are you feeding my brother? He's looking wonderfully robust! AUNT: It's not me. It's your mother! [ALL LAUGH] How are you, Ma? What do you expect being separated from you? Do you know how much I miss you? And I didn't miss you? UNCLE: Really. I can't believe it. Do you know how many years it has been since you came? Five years. [BOLLYWOOD MUSIC PLAYING ON TV] What were you all watching? [ALL LAUGH] TUKI: Raaz. UNCLE: Ask Ma. She has to watch TV twice a day. Ask her and she won't tell you anything. -Ma, tell us, who's that? GRANDMOTHER: That rogue? [ALL LAUGH] KEYA [IN ENGLISH]: So, what have you been doing? Well, it's been terrific. Dilli's so amazing and your college is so beautiful. Isn't it beautiful? Did you meet L? I did. Yeah, she's great. And I also had the best chola bhaturas ever. Oh, yeah. I know where you had those. Chacha di Hatti? No. Um, it was Balbir's dhaba. Yeah, so who did you go with? Tuki? Ma, that's the whole point. Why do I always have to go with someone? Tuki's friends were there. Sid and Radhika. Kabir was there. Yeah, Kabir. You know, Ma's been talking about him all morning. She says you've been seeing a lot of him. -No way. No way! -I mean, do you like him? He's a nice-- -You don't like him? -I don't want to see him. Kaju, every time a guy gets close to you, you just back off. -Darling, don't be so scared of-- -He's such a bourgeois snob. -Bourgeois snob. -Really. Like, he thinks I want to experience how the other half lives... ...and that's why I went to Gobind bhaiyya's jhuggi. Oh, you went to a jhuggi? Yeah, that's where Gobind bhaiyya lives. I went to watch his kids dance. They're so good. I got it on video. [IN HINDI] Ma, did you know that Kaju had gone to a slum? [IN HINDI] No. When did she go? Ma, shouldn't you at least be keeping track of where the child is going... ...what she's up to? [IN HINDI] She doesn't exactly listen to anyone. The whole generation is the same. Tuki is going around with a boyfriend. She thinks I have no idea. She's totally neglecting her studies. GRANDMOTHER: Boyfriend? So what? If she won't have a boyfriend at this age, then when? At mine? [ALL LAUGH] [PHONE RINGS] -Hello? KABIR [OVER PHONE]: Kaju. Hi, Kabir. What's up? -[IN ENGLISH] Look, I'm really sorry. -Oh, that's okay. I just say these things sometimes that I-- -That's okay. -I don't know. -Okay. But this is your last warning. -So, what else has been happening? Not much. Yeah, my mom's just arrived. Oh. Oh, that's nice. So I guess you don't have any time to meet for tea today, hmm? [BOTH LAUGHING] [IN ENGLISH] So silly, L, really. Thank you. [BOTH LAUGHING] [IN HINDI] Delicious! [IN ENGLISH] You won't believe it. I just feel I breathe differently when I'm in India. I never want to go back when I'm here. [IN ENGLISH] Why don't you stay? How can I stay, L? I've got a whole life there. I've got my work, my politics. You'll just get right back into the swing of things. You know, we are really organizing now. Why don't you give it a try? [KEYA SIGHS] KAJU [IN ENGLISH]: I don't know. I think when I was young I used to say I was born in New York. But I guess it's only now that I really want to find out. You know? KABIR [IN ENGLISH]: Well, your mom's home. So can't she help you? At least the names of your birth parents. She doesn't know anymore. I mean, whenever I try to talk to her about it, it's like this wall comes down. I mean, I guess it's hard for her, but it's frustrating, you know? MAN [IN ENGLISH]: How's work? [IN ENGLISH] It's going pretty well, thanks. With? I'm working with migrant workers. It's pretty tough. They're a very, very discriminated section. -How's Kaju? KEYA: She's fine, thanks. Single mothers are not that bad. I tried calling you a few times. I hung up when I heard a different voice. Why did you bother, Neel? NEEL: Because I still care. Keya. Keya, I'm sorry. Now when I think back... ...I think you made the right decision. I'm sorry. I hope.... I hope Kaju's grown up to be the kind of person that you wanted her to be. Yeah. [IN HINDI] I've told you a thousand times to always carry her towel. [IN HINDI] Nothing will happen. She's big, goes to school. What if she feels like vomiting? Look at those lovely vegetables there. GOBIND: Kaju, hurry up. My uncle's waiting for us. We couldn't even sleep at night until we heard the train. [TRAIN HORN BLARING] KABIR [IN ENGLISH]: Are you coming? [IN ENGLISH] I know this place. [IN HINDI] Gobind was very naughty. Always busy playing, not studying. Then Balbir Singh, our neighbor... ...said, "Why don't you send him to my café? He'll learn some work." Balbir Singh was a great guy. [IN HINDI] Uncle, must you talk so much? Always blathering on with your stories. They're not here to listen to your fables. [IN HINDI] No, no. Uncle, do tell us. Why did Gobind's father move from here to Sanjay Colony? Son, till '84 we all lived together. Then half of our slum burned down. A lot of people left their homes. My brother had to take care of the café. Uncle... ...they've come here for the first time. And you've started in with your sob story. Is this the time for such stories? [IN HINDI] But how did the slum burn down? Was there a fire? It wasn't accidental. The fire was deliberately set. Riots, fire. Riots, fire? [IN ENGLISH] Riots. [IN HINDI] You're talking about the '84 riots, right? Yes, the terrible riots of 1984... ...in the aftermath of Indira Gandhi's assassination. Sikhs made up more than half of this colony. Anyone who had a turban or a beard was targeted. The whole city of Delhi was burning. Over 5000 Sikhs were killed. [IN ENGLISH] But why did they kill Sikhs? [SINGING IN HINDI] [IN HINDI] One more! One more song! -[IN HINDI] Okay, okay. Another song. -[IN HINDI] Which one? [SINGING IN HINDI] Hey, look, everyone. Look how stunning Kaju is in a sari. Kaju, please sing a song now. I'm really tired. [IN ENGLISH] No. I don't sing. [FAMILY CHATTERING IN HINDI] Please. KEYA: You guys haven't seen her dance. Tuki, just put on her CD. [FAMILY CHATTERING IN HINDI] Ma, I really don't wanna dance. [FOLK MUSIC PLAYING] [IN ENGLISH] Come on, sweetheart. KAJU: Okay. Hold on a second. This is difficult. Okay. Oh. Is something the matter? Usually you love to dance. I don't know, Ma. I'm just not feeling good inside. Maybe, I don't know, maybe I ate something bad. I thought you ate with Kabir at a coffee shop. I did, but then.... You know, we went to Gobind bhaiyya's jhuggi and.... Did you know about these horrible riots? I mean, most of his slum was burnt down. In Trilokenagar. Mom! [ALL CHATTERING] KAJU: Are you okay? [IN HINDI] Brother, how much did you give me to drink? Mishti, just serve the food now. No, I'm fine. I'm absolutely fine. [IN ENGLISH] Ha! Match! Well played, kiddo. You need more practice. Remind me to give you a two-game head start next time. -[IN ENGLISH] I was letting you win. -Heh. You wish. By the way, were we in Delhi during the '84 riots? I was talking to a friend and I couldn't quite remember. No. [SIGHS] Why do you bother with such things now? Don't tell me this is the urgent thing you called me in office about yesterday. No, actually, Dad, I need a favor. Could you find out through the health ministry? There was this epidemic in '85 in Chandan Hola. -A friend of mine-- -Anything for you. Just bring him over anytime. Actually, I did ask her, Kaju, that is, to come for Sunday lunch. -Hmm. Like that, huh? Heh. -Please, it's hardly like that. Well, it's about time. [BEETHOVEN'S "FÜR ELISE" PLAYING] [BOTH SPEAK INDISTINCTLY] [IN HINDI] Um, I'm Kaju. Is Kabir here? [IN HINDI] Just go straight down the hall. Everyone's in the back garden. [IN ENGLISH] My God. This is Kabir's house? God, I really had no idea. He's really rich. [IN ENGLISH] There's so many paintings in the hall. -Yeah. Ha, ha. -It's beautiful. -Yeah, but this place is never ending. -Yeah, it's huge. Kabir's house! One sec. [IN ENGLISH] By the way, did I tell you? Ranvir has got into Harvard. [IN ENGLISH] Wonderful. Congratulations. And what are Kabir's plans? MEERA [IN ENGLISH]: Well, I hope he does something daring and imaginative. So that he doesn't end up like the rest of us. Ha, ha. Such a riot, Meera. -Would you like another drink? -[IN ENGLISH] A shandy. -Put a little vodka into this? -Scotch on the rocks. Scotch on the rocks. Ha, ha. [IN ENGLISH] And she says: [IN HINDI] "Sohan lal, show me the place where you pee." [ALL CHUCKLE] [IN ENGLISH] Sohan lal turns around and says: [IN HINDI] "Madam, first you show me yours." [ALL LAUGH] [IN ENGLISH] Well, I guess I'm shocked because I just found out about it. I mean, over 5000 people killed in one city in three days. I mean, not that many people were killed in 9/11. And no one knows about it. In the world, I mean. [IN ENGLISH] It's better that they not know about it. Why project this ugly part of India? We must have a good image abroad. WOMAN [IN ENGLISH]: You see, it's a very complex history. But I have a simple question. Which is that, I mean, no matter what the deeper causes for this event... ...or provocation, how come the cops couldn't stop the rioters for three days? -[IN ENGLISH] Exactly. MAN: I can see you're an American. Our police isn't as efficient as your L.A.P.D. They should be trained by the Americans. What rubbish. They were completely efficient... ...when they had to arrest 50,000 under TADA. That's just like the Patriot Act. Don't listen to him. He's an artist. But I'll tell you who can answer your questions. Arun! Weren't you in charge of something or the other in 1984? MEERA: Lunch is getting cold, everybody. Shall we go? [IN HINDI] Come on. Mr. Sehgal, uh, what exactly were you in charge of during the Delhi Riots? It must have been awful. [IN ENGLISH] Ah, so you're the one... ...who's got my son interested in these kinds of things. -No-- -[IN ENGLISH] Dad, this has nothing to do-- And are you the one who was born in Chandan Hola? [PHONE RINGING] -Yeah. -I was going through the records-- Oh, did you find something? Didn't Kabir tell you? -Sir, a call for you. -Just a moment. I was going to tell you. I was going to tell you. [IN HINDI] Show me the jhumkis you have. [IN ENGLISH] You wanted those jhumkis? Those jhumkis are those hanging things. SALESMAN [IN HINDI]: There are different designs. [IN HINDI] These are a bit big. I want the small ones. These are the big ones and these are the small. Yes, these are very pretty. Can you pass me that mirror? [IN ENGLISH] Look, darling, you look so pretty in it. Look. -Isn't that pretty? -Mm-hm. [IN HINDI] Give me both these pairs. How much? SALESMAN [IN ENGLISH]: Seven hundred. -Seven hundred? Do you think we're foreigners? KEYA [IN ENGLISH]: So you never told me about the Sehgal lunch. Who all were there? Was it fun? What's the matter? Did somebody say something to upset you there? What is it, Kaju? [IN ENGLISH] Why did you tell me my parents died... ...in an epidemic in Chandan Hola? Because they did. There was no such thing. There was no epidemic. What do you mean? Who told you that? KAJU: Doesn't matter. The point is there was no-- Of course it matters, Kaju. They don't know what they're talking about. It was Kabir. His father checked the health ministry records for Chandan Hola in 1985. Why should Kabir ask his father to do such a thing? -Mother, you're avoiding the question. KEYA: No, I'm not. Kaju, that's all I know. That is exactly what the adoption agency told me. Where's the agency? KEYA: Kaju, don't you remember? When you first asked me in L.A., I told you this. Don't you remember? The adoption agency doesn't exist anymore. It's 17 or 18 years. Yeah, but there have got to be some papers. The papers will mention something for sure. Where are they? I think your grandfather had them. [IN HINDI] What are you looking for? [IN ENGLISH] Uh, I was just looking for some Scotch tape, actually. Um.... AUNT [IN HINDI]: Ma, the prawns are burning. Thanks. The prawns are getting burnt. I'll be back. [IN ENGLISH] When do we meet for lunch, beta? Outside Basil and Thyme. And don't be late. [IN ENGLISH] Uh, do you have any books on the '84 Delhi Riots? [IN ENGLISH] Delhi Riots? No, I'm afraid there's nothing available. -Nothing? -Nothing at all. What do you want a book on the '84 riots for? Huh. I'll tell you later. There's a call coming. I'll just call you back, okay? Hmm? [CELL PHONE RINGS] Hello? Hi, Kaju? What happened? No, wait, I'm coming. Yeah. Yeah. Just wait there, okay? Bye. Bye. KABIR [IN ENGLISH]: Hi. AUNT [IN HINDI]: Bela, just chop the onions. [IN HINDI] Mishti, let's go out for Chinese today. -Don't cook. I'm just going up for a bit. AUNT: Okay. [IN ENGLISH] Ma. Why didn't you tell me my mother died in Trilokenagar? [IN ENGLISH] What are you talking about? I found this in your stuff. I'm sorry I broke into your trunk. You did what? How dare you do that, Kaju? How could you not tell me this? What are you doing? You've no right to do that. Right? Did you have the right to keep this from me? KEYA: Don't talk to me like that. -I was going to tell you. -When? I've been begging you for any small detail since the time that I can remember. When were you going to tell me? Ma, I'm talking to you. I thought the slum would bring back bad memories. -I didn't want to open those up for you. TUKI [IN ENGLISH]: Hi, everyone. KAJU: So did my parents move from the village to the slum or what? What slum? It turns out my parents used to live in Gobind bhaiyya's slum. TUKI: What? Oh, my God. No wonder you couldn't remember anything in the village. When we went there? And you were trying so hard, remember? Yeah. I must have been a baby then. Wait a sec. Where did you get the death certificate? AUNT [WHISPERING IN HINDI]: Ma, should I intervene? From the adoption agency. The ones that made the mistake about the epidemic? I thought they told you my parents died in the village. But why would they say that if they had the death certificate all along? What's going on, Ma? Was there even a village? [IN ENGLISH] You're back. [IN ENGLISH] Ah, taken over my desk already? Uh, just give me two minutes. I'm on the net. Oh. I think I know what you're up to. It's okay. Take your time. UNCLE [IN HINDI]: Pass the lentils, please. [IN HINDI] Our fishmonger carried on as if he caught the fish... ...in Bangladesh himself. Just taste it and see. Keya, I'll take you to our music rehearsal. The woman who can't sing at all... ...she always likes to stand in front of everyone. Kaju, darling, you're not eating anything. Would you like some rotis? Bela, quickly. Make some rotis. [IN ENGLISH] I don't feel like it, mama. Excuse me. [IN HINDI] Dada... ...I can't cope anymore. [IN ENGLISH] I just feel like I'm messing up so badly. [IN HINDI] You must think that too. I know Neel does. [IN HINDI] Don't listen to him. You're the one who's handled everything. He didn't have to deal with anything. Do you remember when she was 5 years old... ...when she first asked you. You freaked out and frantically called us. Baba was still alive then. We all agreed. "She's too young. You don't have to tell her now." [IN ENGLISH] She's not a child anymore. [IN ENGLISH] Yeah. I know you're right. She's just grown up so fast. [IN HINDI] After finding out everything... ...what if she...? What will she think of me? I'm feeling very scared. [CROWD CHATTERING] [IN ENGLISH] I don't know, I feel kind of bad now. I mean, they didn't mean to. Poor dida. [IN ENGLISH] Look, don't blame yourself at all. It was brave enough for you to confront them. Yeah, but what was the point? I still know nothing about my parents. Are you carrying the death certificate with you? -It has a name on it? -Yeah, but it was all smudged. -I couldn't make out anything. -Let me see. [IN HINDI] Shan, it could be Shannu or maybe Shanno? Or Shanti. It could even be Shanta. [IN HINDI] It could even be Shanta. Leela, you are too good. You should do crosswords. What? I passed the eighth grade. I have decided that I will finish high school with my children. In fact, I bet I can guess the last name too. What were the letters? -It starts with the letter K and ends with R. LEELAVATI: It could be Kaur. It could be Kakkar or Kanwar. It could even be Kumar. Didn't Uncle keep talking about a Kumar? Try and remember. -Why'd you stop working the pump? -[IN HINDI] I've got work to do. What, just now you wanted roti. Told me to make rotis. Amazing man. Won't eat roti, won't push the pump. Hey, bring back some squash. Wants to eat squash, eat this, eat that. Really, this man. Look, left a pen in his pocket. You work the pump at a good speed. Do you also do this in America? How much would a pump be there? [IN HINDI] Do you think Gobind's uncle knows any Shanno or Shanta? There's no guarantee with Uncle. But there is an old lady called Durga Aunty who knows everything and everyone. What I say is let's eat lunch here and take our evening tea with her. You see, sugar prices have really gone up. [IN HINDI] Maybe that could be it. Shanti Kumar. LEELAVATI [IN HINDI]: Did she have any children? DURGA: Yes, she had a daughter. I can't remember the girl's name. And Shanti, what about her? -What happened to her? -I don't know. I don't know where she went. LEELAVATI: When, where? -Huh? LEELAVATI: Where and when would she have left? I don't remember the date. Wait, she was here until '84. She left after that. LEELAVATI: '84. [IN HINDI] During the riots? LEELAVATI: During the riots? -Were they Sikh? How could she be Sikh? LEELAVATI: Shanti Kumar is a Hindu name. Aunty, try to remember clearly. Where would she have gone? As I was saying, it was during '84. We were all sitting in the train. And the little girl was with us too. MAN [IN HINDI]: Indira Gandhi has been killed. Her bodyguards did it. They were both Sikh. These Sikhs have to be taught a lesson. [IN ENGLISH] Shit! They killed Mrs. Gandhi! [CROWD SHOUTING OUTSIDE] [IN ENGLISH] They seem to be attacking Sikhs. These guys are in real danger. [IN HINDI] Sir! Sir! You have to hide! There's only space for one person to hide here. Cut your hair. You have to cut your hair. -I have a pair of scissors. -Please. No! MAN 1: They're coming! Do it! Hurry up! Hurry up! They're breaking the door down! [SOBBING] MAN 2 [IN HINDI]: Bring out the bastards! Go and look ahead! [IN HINDI] Sir, if there were any Sikhs here, you think we would have spared them? There aren't any here. Go on. They eat our food and kill our leaders. The swine. Do you think we'd let these bastards live? Go! -Who is that? -He's my son. -What's the matter with him? -Suresh Iyer. He's got a fever. We are Mr. and Mrs. Iyer. This is our son. -There are no Sikhs here. -Okay. Okay. Let's move on. KABIR: Kaju. [IN ENGLISH] You don't have to do this, you know. I mean, we can just go back. It's okay not to find out. [IN ENGLISH] I don't want to find out. But I can't stop myself. [WOMEN LAUGH] [IN HINDI] Excuse me. [IN HINDI] We're looking for someone called Shanti. Shanti from Trilokenagar. We heard that she lives here now. Shanti, some people are here to meet you. [IN HINDI] Yes? I don't recognize you. Actually, Kaju was born in Trilokenagar, in 1981. Until 1985 she lived there with her parents. We think they may have died in 1985. We found out that her mother's name was Shanti. I lived there too in Trilokenagar. But I have a son, not a daughter. WOMAN 1: Son, please come in. SHANTI: Come, children. Sit. KAJU [IN HINDI]: Do you know Durga Aunty? She was with you on a train in '84. Those were bad times. That night when I came back-- Shanti hid my entire family in her house. And that's why they burned her house down. But how did it all start? [IN HINDI] I had disguised my son in a brown kurta... ...and a white pajama just like yours. He looked like a pretty girl, my son did. He was scared. He said, "Mummy, I'm not going out." I said, "Son, no one will realize you are a boy." There was a mob in the alley. The politician was there too. He pointed and said: "Hey, that's Kulbir Singh's wife... ...and they don't have a daughter. Catch them." They removed my son's pajamas. Wicked politician. They killed my son. A politician did it? Indeed, a member of the government. It was all under his supervision. He gave the orders. But not all government officials were involved. It must have been a few bad politicians, no? All of them were involved. Police, bureaucrats, government, politicians, the whole lot. But there must have been some good officials too... ...in the police and the government? WOMAN 2: Son, the question is not of one or two people. For 20 years we've been banging on the doors of justice. WOMAN 1: Ten thousand people were killed. Twenty years have gone by. Governments have changed. One party comes into power, the other goes. The second goes and the third comes. But we didn't get justice. My son's killers roam the streets. No court has punished them. Ma'am, in our courts it takes years. On top of that, there's corruption. With circumstances like these justice takes a while. Justice is delivered. When it suits them. Two of the killers of November '84 were punished. The killers of Indira Gandhi. ARUN [IN ENGLISH]: It's all very well for you to sit here and lecture. Have you ever been in a riot? You've bloody well been sheltered your whole life. KABIR [IN ENGLISH]: There's no point talking about this. I've decided not to do an MBA. Ah. So you're taking advice from Kaju? I'm writing a play and you should read it sometime. It's called 1984: Wo Kali Raat. It's about what people did and did not do. [IN HINDI] Every Tom, Dick and Harry has Kumar as a last name. Even well-known film stars. Gobind, wasn't that thug also called Kumar? [IN HINDI] You're too much, Uncle. Sometimes you bring up such irrelevant stuff. -But what was his name? -I don't know. Kaju, he was the one who killed our Balbir. Balbir was our Sikh neighbor. We hid his family. We thought no one would find out. But I don't know how that thug KK found out. Yes. That was his name. KK. Kishan Kumar. He was our neighborhood's small-time thug. He was no small-time thug. He was a big gangster. He had connections with many big politicians. And he carried this huge knife with him at all times. Uncle, listen to me once and for all. He didn't kill Balbir. He did kill him. I saw it with my own eyes. He dragged Balbir out of the house. The mob drenched Balbir in kerosene and KK lit a match. Balbir started screaming. My brother and I wrapped him in a blanket and took him to the hospital. By evening he was dead. It was KK, Kishan Kumar, who killed him. Didn't I tell you he didn't kill Uncle Balbir? Why are you defending that bastard? He did not kill Uncle Balbir! I killed him! And now I live off his café. I'm telling the truth. When you sent me outside... ...I ran into KK. He recognized me. He held the knife against my throat and demanded: "You work for Balbir, don't you? Tell me where he's hiding." I kept screaming, shouting: "I don't know anything. I don't know anything." But in a rage he stabbed me here. See this. Here. I called for Father, I called for you. Why didn't you come? You sent me alone outside to find out what was happening? If I hadn't told him, he would have killed me. That's why... ...I told him. Gobind, my son. You were just a child. How could it be your fault, son? How could it be your fault? GOBIND: I killed Uncle Balbir. And I didn't tell anyone until now. [SOBBING] KAJU [IN ENGLISH] She just never wants to talk to me about it. UNCLE [IN HINDI]: Kaju, dear, listen to me. Why won't she talk to me? What is it? I mean, I just found out all this stuff today. All these gruesome killings and a slum which was burnt down. What did my birth parents do? What did we all do? UNCLE: Kaju, sweetie, if as you think... ...all Hindus were responsible for these killings... ...there would not have been a single Sikh left alive in the entire city of Delhi. What about you all? What did you guys do? What do you think? [IN HINDI] Excuse me, which one is KK's auto? -[IN HINDI] Boss? -[IN HINDI] What? Somebody's asking for you. Tell them I don't want to take them. Boss, it's not a customer. It's someone to meet you. Who in the hell has been born to meet me? Won't even let me sleep in peace. Is your name Kishan Kumar? And if it is? I wanted to talk to you about something. -Be my guest. -Here? Um, let's talk over a cup of tea? Let's go. [IN HINDI] Just ask me what you want straight out. Don't beat around the bush like a cop. I don't like all this beating around the bush. Tell me what you want. KABIR [IN HINDI]: What happened to your family? They must be dead. What do I care? And your daughter? Must be in an orphanage or in a brothel. Do you remember the '84 riots? What riots? I was not a part of any riots. No one goes and confronts those... ...who gave us the kerosene to burn the Sikhs alive. Those who gave us electoral rolls to identify the Sikh houses... ...and kill every Sikh. You're scared of them... ...because they live in grand government bungalows. We only followed orders. That's all. [IN HINDI] You followed orders? Then who killed my Uncle Balbir? I'll kill you, you dog! I'll drink your blood! [BOTH YELLING] [IN ENGLISH] Thanks. I just can't stop my teeth from chattering. [IN ENGLISH] Kaju, he's not your father, you know. His last name begins with K and ends in R. -So what? -He lived in Trilokenagar. Yes, which has a population of 1000, if not more. He had a daughter. The daughter got adopted. I mean, all that added up. It can't be a coincidence. Yes, it can. You're too beautiful to be his daughter. There's no way a man like that can be your father. Why not? You think killers don't have families? We just found out about these politicians... ...who go around in fancy cars and live in big mansions. If he'd been like them and you saw him in your living room... ...you'd have been okay with him? Kabir, you have to face up to the fact that I'm a kid from the slums. Kaju, what your father or my father did or did not do... ...has nothing to do with us. It has nothing to do with.... It has nothing to do with you and me. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] TUKI [IN ENGLISH]: Kaju, we're leaving for the cultural function. I'll explain to Kabir, okay? Listen, take care, okay? Try to catch some of it. I will. Best of luck. Thanks, Tuki. TUKI: Aunty, Kaju said we should carry on. She'll walk. AUNT [IN HINDI]: Come on, come on. It's getting late. [ALL CHATTERING] [IN ENGLISH] She's wearing a sari. TUKI: Aunt. I want you to meet Siddharth. He's just walked in with Kabir! I think we should start now. Best of luck, everyone. [IN ENGLISH] I don't know why Kaju's late. [IN ENGLISH] Um, she said she might be a while. But just call her up. It's really getting late. Um, actually, I don't know if she'll be home right now. Where else would she be? -She went to some dhaba. -What do you mean dhaba? [IN ENGLISH] Tuki, what is happening? Um, she said she had to go meet someone who might be her dad. -What? -Actually, I know what's happening. -Where is Kaju? Where is she? -This is in Gobindpuri. Tuki, just go. Just go straight away and get the key from your dad. Just go, Tuki! Let me come with you. I know the place. Kabir, just give me the directions. [ALL SINGING IN HINDI] [KEYS JINGLE] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [ALL CONTINUE SINGING IN HINDI] [KK MUTTERING] KEYA [IN ENGLISH]: Oh, my God, Kaju. Come, come, we have to get out of here. Come, Kaju. Don't cry like that, my darling. Whoever that man is, he's not your father. KAJU [IN ENGLISH]: He is. Don't try and shield me from the truth. You're right. You are strong enough to know the truth. Your father was a good man. His name was not Kumar. It was Gurbachan Singh. GURBACHAN [IN HINDI]: What are you kids doing here? Come on inside. Your mother's calling. Come here, my baby. [IN HINDI] Come on, children, come for lunch. KEYA: And your mother. Her name was Shanno. Shanno Kaur. [ARJUN CRYING] SHANNO: Come quickly. The food's getting cold. KEYA: And you had a little baby brother. Arjun. -What's the matter with Arjun? -I don't know. He just started crying. Was there a fight between them? What about my name? Was I always called Kaju? No. Your name was Amrit. Your brother named you Amu. And then that's what everybody called you. Amu. Amu. SHANNO: Will Amu have it or Ma? Come, feed your brother also. [CROWD SHOUTING OUTSIDE] What's all this commotion? [ARJUN FUSSES] -Some people are running. -Should I go take a look? SHANNO: No, finish your food first. [ARJUN CRYING] [GLASS SHATTERS] SHANNO: What was that? Shanno, you stay here. I'll go take a look. No, don't go! Don't go outside! Don't go outside. Don't be scared. I'm taking the dagger with me. You stay with the kids. SHANNO: Kids, come here. Don't make any sound, okay? Just sit here quietly. GURBACHAN: Shanno, Shanno, go get the police! Amu! Ajju! Don't move until I come back. ARJUN [IN HINDI]: Bring my mummy to me! [GLASS SHATTERING &amp; CROWD SHOUTING] GURBACHAN: What have I done?! [ALL SHOUTING] SHANNO: Leave him! He hasn't done anything. Let go! Help! Help! MAN: Beat them! Kill them! Burn them! No Sikh should escape! GURBACHAN: I haven't done anything! SHANNO: Help me! Help me, please! -[IN HINDI] Off with you! Be gone! SHANNO: Is anyone there? Save us! Save us! -[IN HINDI] Mummy! ARJUN: Amu! AMU: My brother's in there! Stop! ARJUN: Amu! Ma! Ma! Arjun! SHANNO: Save us. Please. [IN HINDI] Burn all Sikhs. Don't leave a single one alive! Mummy. Arjun! Mummy. Arjun! SHANNO: Wait! I'm coming! [DOG BARKING] [SHANNO CRYING] Ajju! Ajju! [SHANNO SOBBING] My baby brother. I couldn't do anything to save my baby brother. Darling, you were only a little baby yourself. How could you have done anything? It was so organized. They were all involved. The government, the police. Thousands of families were destroyed. And you? Did you know my mother? I met you and your mother in a relief camp. It was the people of the city and the Gurdwaras, not the government... ...which had set up these camps. [SOBBING] [IN ENGLISH] It's just awful. These are the most awful cases. She's lost nine children. Her daughters were raped. What's the use of just making lists? We have to do something about it. KEYA [IN ENGLISH]: Namaste, comrade. -Do you have enough? -[IN ENGLISH] These are from Sultanpuri. Yes, here you go, sir. KEYA: Do we have enough now? MAN: I think we'll fall short. We'll need to ask for some more. KEYA: Do you know where Shanno and Amu are? I'll just see where they are. Amu! [IN HINDI] See, my child, what your aunty has brought you. What all have I brought you today? Sit here. And I'll just show you. I've got you a sketch book... ...and crayons. Namaste, Shanno. Shanno? What's wrong? [IN HINDI] You didn't come yesterday, sister. Why didn't you come yesterday? Yesterday I had to go to that other camp. Why, did something happen yesterday? Everyone was calling me mad. Forcibly shutting me up. But why? Yesterday that politician had come. To distribute blankets. The one with the dark glasses. I threw the blankets in his face. "I don't want blankets from murderers," I said. And these people call me mad. Am I mad or are they? KEYA: Which politician? Sister, he is the same one that I had gone to for help near the railway line. The day that.... That.... And he said: "Not one Sikh should survive." KEYA: Shanno, you did absolutely the right thing. We'll file a report with the police. You are a key witness. Only then will you get justice, Shanno. Justice? Justice, sister? Will I get justice? Will I get my husband back? Will Amu get her father back? Will Amu get her brother back? Can I get my baby back? [SHANNO CRYING] KEYA [IN ENGLISH]: She was so brave, your mother. Then what happened? My mother. What happened to my mother? They wore her spirit down. How many times did she have to go to that police station? They didn't believe her. And even after three months... ...the government had not rehabilitated the victims. And the tragedy was she had to go back. To that room... ...where the little baby had been killed. KEYA [IN HINDI]: What happened here? AMU [IN HINDI]: She fell. KEYA: The girl fell? What happened to the boy? AMU: The boy is carrying the vegetables. [KEYA CHUCKLES] KEYA: And what's this? AMU: He's putting medicine. She got hurt. KEYA: Ah. AMU: Oh, my father. Amu, do you want to draw now? Here's your slate. What will you draw? [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] -[IN ENGLISH] Jug? -[IN ENGLISH] Duck! [IN HINDI] You'll draw a duck? Okay. Can you draw an elephant too? -[IN HINDI] No. -Okay. Draw whatever you feel like. I could do nothing to stop it. I wish I.... I visited you. Almost every day. She seemed to be recovering. [IN HINDI] Shanno, I'm so late. I'm sorry. [GASPS] [KEYA CRYING] [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] SHANNO [IN HINDI]: "Keya, sister, today is my baby Arjun's birthday. I wanted to go to the Sikh temple and pray for him. But as the day wore on, my pain became unbearable. Today is his birthday. And he's dead. Sister, I am leaving Amrit in your care. She should not remember anything. Not her father. Not her baby brother. Not her mother. She should never know who she is. She is young. She will forget everything. Sister, I have one more request. She should never know that her mother left her. That her mother could not live for her sake. And chose to die instead. Please fulfill this. My dying wish. I will remain eternally grateful to you. Shanno." Amu? Have you seen Amu? Amu? Amu, come, my child. Come to me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [KEYA CRYING] It's not your fault. It's not your fault. Amu? [IN ENGLISH] Good evening. As many as 57 people are now thought to have died... ...in violence in a train in Gujarat. The Sabarmati Express was carrying karsewaks... ...back from Ayodhya to Ahmedabad... ...and the violence erupted after it entered Godhra... ...about three hours from Ahmedabad. These are the images of the train after it was attacked. It appears that the violence was in response to karsewaks... ...provoking locals in the Muslim-dominated area of Godhra a little earlier. The coaches carrying karsewaks were first stoned... ...and then four coaches were set on fire. More than 50 people were killed....
