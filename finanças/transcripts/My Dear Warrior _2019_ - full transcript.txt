[theme music playing] Hey! There must be a tiny man inside. [Hoshi grunts] Such a beautiful drawing! It looks so real. I really admire your skill. Don't move! [camera shutter clicks] Good! Here you are! Wow! I've got an idea! Let's take a picture together! Here goes! Smile! [camera shutter clicks] Hey! Let me take a look! Hoshi! Sorry, I don't think I'll be able to help you find the book. I gotta go see Aunt Wanda. No problem, Princess! I was happy just to hear that you'd like to help. Tomorrow is not too late to start. All right! [car horn honks] Watch out, Hoshi! -[Hoshi gasps] -[Sky shrieks] [gasps] Ouch! You hurt me! Watch before crossing the street... You, in real life and in anime, are exactly the same. Very sweet and gentle! [chuckles] Not as light as in the anime, is it? Yeah. That's because of gravity, you know. Gravity? Right. It's the natural force that attracts an object towards another. That's why I weight. It's not easy to be in the world. Hi, Sky and the Warrior! They are here. [continues humming] [doorbell rings] Go hide yourself! Go! Hurry up! Go, go! [doorbell rings] Hoshi, get in there! Go inside! And be quiet! Shhh! [humming] [doorbell rings] [humming] Oh! [both] Hello, Aunt Wanda! -Hi, Carry! -Dusty! -Harry! -Britney! Sofie! How are you? Hmm, it's Manee! Her name is Manee! [gasps] [both] Hello, Manee! Her name has changed again! Not the same as yesterday. Today, she got a new name. [kissing sounds] [humming] [toilet flushing] [gasps] [both] Someone's in the bathroom! Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Don't go in there! Stop! [woman sniffing] What? Don't make a mess! What? -Shhh! -You! I sense a man's smell. [Sky struggling] [gasping] Sky! [gasping] -What is it? -I... I saw a ring. -What is it, Aunty? -Ring, the ring! I saw a ring! Ring! Ring! Ring! Ring! Ring! I think they want private time to talk. We should give them some space. [mouthing] So, what about that? -Okay! Let's get out of here! -[Wanda] Ring! Ring! Ring! Ring! Ring! Ring! [both] We've got to go, Aunty. Bye, Sky! Ring! Ring! Ring! -Ring! The ring, Sky? -What ring? What ring? You just told me that you saw a ring. Ring! What ring, Sky? I can't recall. [stammers] I... can't recall. I don't recall anything. -What ring? -Don't worry! Calm down, please. -Just get some rest. -Ring! Ring! Come on, please. -Slowly. -Ring! Ring! -Easy, Aunty. -Ring! What ring? -Ring! -Come and sit here. -Ring! Ring! Ring! -I'll move this out of the way, okay? [panting] [machine whirring] [reading] Stay with your aunty, all right? And be a good girl! [girl sobbing] [sobbing] Come stay with me, okay? [inhales] [sighs in frustration] -[shouts] -[objects clattering] [object clattering] [shouting] Why? Why don't you come out? [panting] [thudding] Wanda, Wanda! I believe that substance can be decomposed in any dimension. But human beings and objects don't take the same amount of time to decompose. The process can be slow or fast. It's up to the factors. Factors? Yes. A human being's... lifespan is a factor. Lifespan and human bodies have their own cycle. Living and nonliving things do not require the same amount of time to decompose. We have to guess where, when and how that thing got out? That's how to find the factors. Ring! Hmm... It's... -[chuckles] -[laughs] Are you doing some kind of research? It's just... It's just hypothetical... If this happened, that person must have been very confused. RING Right. If I need any clarification, I'll call you again, sir. Thank you! -[clock bell chiming] -Thank you. Wind breezes slowly, leaves sway. Weary and longed for, just like my heart. Time has passed, we are apart. Heartbreaking always. Like days without nights. Luna... I have missed you. Hoshi... I'm here. Hoshi? Hoshi? Hoshi? Hoshi? Hoshi? [footsteps approach] Hoshi! Hoshi, I'm here. Luna! Hoshi! Wait, Hoshi! Hoshi! Hoshi! [groans in frustration] 20 YEARS AGO [gasping] No! [gasping] [hands thud on table] [breathing heavily] [siren wailing] [car horns honking] Where are you, Hoshi? Why don't you listen to me? If something happens to you... No, no, no, no! I'll find you. [car horn honking] Hoshi! It's Hoshi! Hoshi! Hoshi! [panting] Hoshi! Stop jumping out of the building and running away like this! I'm worried, you know! If something happens to you, how could I survive? [crying] I parked my car over there. Come on! Hurry up! Damn, I must be in trouble now! Come on! Come, Hoshi! I'm sorry! Sorry! Get inside! Come on! [groaning] [groaning intensifies] What's up with her? [man] She refused to eat. [Luna groaning] Why didn't you make her eat? [Luna panting] [Luna continues groaning] Luna! Luna! Luna! Luna! [groans] [exhales] Stop! You've no right to touch me. [metal clanking] Are you all right? No. What's wrong? I'm worried about you. You start to feel the same, right? What? You're afraid. Afraid? You're afraid to be alone in this world. In this world, there's still a lot for you to learn. Let me be by your side... to help you, okay? You know, if something happens to you, how is Luna gonna live? -[humming] -[sewing machine whirring] Ah! [continues humming] [machine whirring] Aunty? What's up? Do you recall about the ring? What? You told me that you saw a ring. Where is the ring? Ring? Ah! Uh... Hmm... That's fine. So... How about the "J" symbol? Did you make it? Ah! You know it now, right? Yes, I do. It's "J". A letter of the alphabet. Don't you know that? Never mind! [sings alphabet song] [murmuring] Hi, Wax! I'm on my way. Hmm. [clicks tongue] Is it? Do you know him? I think so. So, it's him or not? I don't know. It could be him. It looks like that. Right. Is it? You're absolutely crazy! You've been talking to yourself for an hour. Hmm! I'm leaving! Hey! [groans in frustration] [man] Sky! It's been 20 years. Look, you are now a grown-up girl. Well, who are you? I'm Jate! I finally... found you. 20 YEARS AGO After you and Wanda disappeared, I was so miserable. I wasn't able to write an anime. Because my life partner had left me. I wondered if I had treated her so badly. I didn't give up, though. Excuse me. Have you seen them? [woman] No, I haven't. I'd looked for you and Wanda for five years in vain. -Have you seen them? -No. [Jate] Then, I gave up. But I haven't found a peaceful life. I wake up from a nightmare every night. [sighs] Nightmares about what I did to make you and Wanda leave me. Nightmares that have been haunting me, and I don't want to feel guilty till I die. I have to know if you and Wanda are still alive or not. Finally... I've found you! Happy belated birthday! Yes? Don't you remember me? Uncle Jate. Wanda's lover. Uncle Jate? It's been 20 years. Now, you are such a beautiful woman. Twenty years? There were so many unfortunate incidents. Like what? Many... We didn't expect them to happen. That was all my fault. I just wanted to prove that we could have a better life. I shouldn't have written that damn book. Book? What book? Well... it was the anime. The anime that Wanda and I wrote together. Don't you know? Yes, the anime. [line ringing] [Jate] Hmm... Until now... you and Wanda may not forgive... or trust me, right? You came to see me here... -Sky? Hello? Sky? -...at the isolated hallway like this, how do you expect me to trust you? Sky! [mouthing] Are you okay? [keys clanking] Pick it up, Aunty! [panting] Aunty? Aunt? Aunty? Hoshi? Hoshi? Aunt? [panting] [phone ringing] [exhales sharply] Uncle Jate? -[cell phone ringing] -[exclaims] Hello? Hey? Is my aunt with you? No, she's not here. Isn't she there? She's gone. But her cat is here. Aunt Wanda gone and left her cat. What? Sky, calm down and don't panic. How long? Has she been gone for 24 hours? [groans] [groans] [humming] -Come on, Warrior! -[chuckles] [humming] I'll shop all over the store. [humming] [exclaims] [exclaims] [murmuring] [murmuring] [clicks tongue] [gasps] Pluto! Pluto's food! Hmm. One is enough. [humming] [murmuring] [murmuring] [gasps] Pluto! Pluto! Pluto! Pluto! Pluto! Pluto! Pluto! Pluto! Pluto! [gasps] [exclaims] This is Pluto's food. One is enough. [humming] Aunty? Aunt? Aunt? Aunty? [leaves rustling] [theme music playing] [Sky] Bad things often happen when least expected. You have no control over them. You just have to make every minute count. We are lost. Lost? Are we lost? Are we gonna stay here? If something happens to you, how am I gonna live? Princess, what happened? Hoshi? Did you sleep with him? [closing theme music playing]
