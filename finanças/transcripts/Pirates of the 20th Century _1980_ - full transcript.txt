Gorky Central Film Studio for Youth and Children First Artists Association PIRATES OF THE XX-CENTURY The client with the cargo of opium is starting for Vladivostok tomorrow at 8 in the morning. Well, the cargo is now yours. Please... It's regrettable, Captain, that you can't stay for a day or two. There's a very profitable cargo for Japan. This opium is indispensable for the factory. Just one factory needs so much opium? A big country needs a lot of medicines. - So it's straight home? - Yes, straight home.

On portside. Lower the lifeboat! Engine full stop! How's he doing? - Did he say who he was? - He doesn't know a word of Russian. You mean he didn't have his visiting card with him? If we didn't pick him up, he would have been a goner. The sharks must be not hungry this year. Which never happens to Mikosha. The radio chief wants to see you right away. All right, I'm going. - Did you make that up? - What? The line about the radio chief. Of course I did. Saleh... Gosha... Sit down, will you? Did you have to swim a long way? I think we'd do better with the chief engineer here. Why don't you go and get him? Come in. Sergey, we need your help over there. - How is our shipwrecked sailor? - Recovering. He's eating now. Have him see me when he's finished. The name of the ship was "Samuel de Carlston". They were sailing from Sidney to Yokohama with cotton. What happened to the ship? The cotton caught fire. It spread to the deck. There was a lot of panic. The crew began fighting for life-belts. When did all this happen? Yesterday after the sun was down. So he's been in the water for twenty hours. Do you think there were other survivors? If you give us the approximate co-ordinates, then we could contact all the ships in the area. Captain, we've just sighted a ship dead ahead of us. I'm coming. Nobody on deck watch, and no one on the bridge. - Doesn't seem to be any damage. - No flags on her either. What do you think could've happened? The crew must have abandoned the ship. Lower the lifeboat! Shall I take charge? Take two men with you, and the Second Engineer. Find out if it's anything mechanical. You go along too, and call us as soon as you find the radio. Don't everybody go aboard. Leave two man in the lifeboat. Aye, aye. I always thought that phantom ships only exist in kiddies tales. No matter what we do, you always boil it down to a horror story. Well, we'll soon find out what's going on. Slow ahead! I can't see our men on the deck anymore. Maybe they're playing a joke on us. Maybe we are in the Bermuda Triangle. Go get the radio operator! Full astern! Get going! Take the engine room! The bridge! Hey, you men! That was pretty well done. You had it figured just right. I knew they'd fish you out. The Russians are relaxing. We've locked them in the cabins. Unload as quick as you can. Right! You want to know what I think? I'm doing the thinking here. Are you having second thoughts? They've rescued you after all. - I'm only joking. - I don't like jokes. Come on, move it! Opium! Move it, move it! Now take it easy! Watch out for the detonator. We don't want to sink with the Russians. The dynamite goes down to the engine room! That's it. Come on, move it! Come on! Keep down, crawl on your bellies, you hear! I've found the women! They're locked in the library. Damn it! Get to the lifeboat! - Follow me! - No! I'm scared. Down the corridor! - Is that all? - All that are alive. Mayna! - Hang on! - Here, grab hold! The ship will sink now, and the pirates will see us then. What are we going to do? Take a diesel oil bath, There's plenty of it. Give me a flare! I think we should pull out now, Captain. Full speed ahead! There're not enough of us. I doubt that we can row against this current. Yes. We're being swept to the South East. If that's the case, we're getting further away from the shipping lanes. Calling all Soviet ships in the area with co-ordinates: eight degrees latitude north, 138 degrees longitude east! At about twenty hundred hours. Contact has been lost for a day now with the S/S Nezhin. Your instructions are to search for the ship and its crew. Land... Land! Island! Pirates! A machine gun! Starting to work up an appetite. Tell your appetite to shut up. It raided the steward's room enough. Aren't you going to give me a kiss? Well, now we know where we stand. - But what are we going to do? - Fight. Fight with what? - What about this? - Or this? We can't fight machine guns with flare pistols. I'll repeat the question. How many men are left in the ship? I'll give you one minute. Did you save him? You're our friend, aren't you? - What's your name? - Maa. I'm Sergey. Why did you kill him? Our people had lived here a long time when their ship came. We're just a small tribe of pearl divers. They killed our men, then they violated our women. And that one... He killed my father. Can you tell us how many of them there are? It means now there're 15 of them. They're going to be looking for us in the morning. We've got to take the ship tonight. We'll have to take that machine gun or we'll never get out. - I'll do it, Captain. - Take whoever you need with you. You coming with me? You're scared. I see. I want to come with you. We might not come back, you know that? I know. Here's the way I see it. The women and Kluyev will stay in the cave. You stay here, don't move at all! You can't be seen from shore, only from the water. The pirates can't stay on the island forever, sooner or later they'll leave. When they do, you go to the middle of the island. There's fresh water, so there's life there. Ivan Ilyich! Don't put me to disgrace, Ivan Ilyich. All right, you can come along. Let's all get some sleep now. Noi! Where are you? No radio contact with the S/S Nezhin has been established in the last seventy-two hours. Calling all Soviet ships. Extend the searching area to the following co-ordinates... - Halt! Who goes there? - Who? It's Stetsenko. Igor Mikhailovich. Born in 1959... Russian sailor. Can you give me something to eat? Now! Noi! Where have you been? Give me a hand. I thought you ran away, and forgot your pal. Throw your guns over! Move it! Go to the radio shack! Lock the bandits up in the hold. - Is he alive? - No. - If only I had a grenade... - And blow up the radio? I heard something. Someone's in there! Go get the captain. I'd like to speak to the captain. He's eating lunch. He told me not to disturb him. Are you in the habit of serving peas of lead for lunch? So, you honor us with your presence? - How is it going? - He's got a year's supply of bullets. Keep up the good work. I'm very happy to see you, Captain. You can forget the formalities. This isn't the time or place. I have a proposition to make to you. Do you see this motor-launch? It's yours. I'll give you some fuel, a compass and charts, too. Then you can get the hell out of here. I'm attached to my men. There aren't many of them left now. There are fewer of them than you think. Ivan Ilyich, the radio is ready. The times when you could dictate your conditions are all over now. The radio transmitter is ours. I hate to spoil your fun, Captain... But you don't have a radio... This is part of it. It's not going to be easy for your ship either. Only I can pilot you. However I don't feel like working for you as a pilot. And last but not least... As you can see, we have the other lady, too. Everything depends on you. If you want to make their stay pleasant, you'll think over my proposition. You have till twelve tonight. All right, let's go! Let's get out of here! Sergey! We've got to find our way through that channel. Well? There're too many rocks. It beats me how they found their way in. The ebb tide is due in two hours now. Maybe we could make use of it. And leave the girls? We can't leave them here, we all know that. If we can make it out to the open sea, then we'll have a chance. We can't go along with their conditions. They'll never let the motor-launch go. They don't want witnesses. It's open! You better check that the anchor is fast. Looks like the captain's personal file. Saleh, alias Li Gwan, alias Ngouen Cho. Has ties with Hong Kong, Macao, Singapore. Three ships to his credit. A professional terrorist. Hunted by Interpol for the hijacking of a Boeing 747. Broke out of Saigon jail, killing a guard. Insensitive to pain. Drinks like a fish, but can hold it. Very obvious sadistic tendencies. His weaknesses: narcotics and women. A maniac, waits for just the right time before moving in for the kill. He's a real beauty. Shveihert. Alias Rolf Shneider, alias Kurt Winner. Took part in reprisals in South Africa, Angola. Sharpshooter. Handy with the blade. Has a gut feeling for siding with the strong. A pathological liar, and very stingy. Hard worker. Easy to please in terms of living conditions and food. Sentimental. Loves his mother. We can always complain to his mother. All fast and nine meters depth, sir. Nine meters is thirty-one feet. South west, one hundred meters, 28 feet. This marine chart indicates the depths. So we can find our way out with it. I don't like this one bit. It's too quiet. Eight meters... Seven. Port engine, stop! Starboard engine, slow astern! Ten meters... Look! - It's a mine! - Stop! Engines full astern! Don't shoot! We'll be washed up on the rocks! They're coming back. - Want me to get the motor launch? - We have time. If they've decided to agree to our conditions, they'll give us a signal. We still don't know what's going on with them. And we have their girls with us. I got you, boss. Go on, beat her! I don't beat women, I know other ways to make them talk. Other ways... Beat her! Beat her! If you want to get anywhere, you have to forget your feelings. Now you go to work, make her talk! I'm going to have a chat with the other one. So you've told me everything you've seen yourself? That means they're both alive. Stetsenko, get the crew together, quick! Right away, Captain. Well, are you ready to start talking? I don't understand. You don't like whiskey? It's a very good whiskey. Speak up! You don't understand English? French neither? Shall we speak to her in German? They must have taught you something when you were in school. I'll bet you were the best student in your class. Am I right? Let's see how much you've learned while you were there. It seems you haven't studied that in school. Hey, Hardy! Do you like her? Saleh, it's the Russian captain. The proposition still goes. Give me my men, and you'll get the girls plus the motor-launch and the fuel. I can't give you any weapons though. The terms are harder now. You couldn't reach the open sea. And the ship? Don't forget my people are aboard. That's why I offer you the motor-boat. Otherwise, why negotiate? And what if I paid you a decent price? What currency would you prefer? Dollars? Pounds? Or maybe Thailand's bats? So you know where we hide our cash? That's why you sailed into the channel with so much assurance. Don't get any ideas, Captain. I had the crew put a can of gasoline in your cabin. The last one alive will set fire to it. You're a very clever man, Captain. I'm going to try to live up to that compliment. Try to understand, that opium really belongs to us. The dealers will pay us a good price for it. What I'm offering you is something more precious... Your life. It would be very easy for you to chase us, catch us and ram us. - Do you have any choice? - There are plenty of choices. I would prefer to die with honor, and at the same time get rid of you. Let's not get too excited, Captain. You're an experienced skipper. The ship can't go much faster than the motor launch. And timewise you will have a considerable advantage. I'll need time to weigh anchor, after that I'll need time to sail through the channel... and finally, you know that the open sea exit is mined. And de-mining it will take more time. You'll have a minimum of one hour to find your way to the open sea. Then you'll be able to change your course. I'd never catch up with you. So what do we decide? Let me think for a minute. First I want the motor launch engine checked, and the water and food supply sampled by your men. You must all be unarmed. Those are the terms for the exchange of prisoners. What interests me most is the cargo. All should be completed by 6 a.m. Full speed ahead! Those bastards! They're not so dumb. Send a wire: "We're coming back." Let them prepare a great reception. Sergey... From the captain. You again! What do you want? Don't kill me! You're going to need me. I'll do whatever you... Stick 'em up! Up I said! On your feet! Transmit a S.O.S. Make it quick! All right, only don't kill me! I'll do what you want. Who's at the door? Find out! - What do you want? - The captain wants you. All right. Now give our co-ordinates. - Are you coming or not? - Coming! Don't open. If you do, he'll shoot. That's enough. On your feet! Move! Don't shoot! What's going on?! Stop the engines! Let go the anchor! Stop the engines! Mayday, mayday, mayday... Calling all warships, submarines, airforce craft! A freighter has been attacked by pirates. Will all who receive this message go to the following co-ordinates: seven degrees eighteen minutes north latitude, 138 degrees eleven minutes east longitude! THE END
