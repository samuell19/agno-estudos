Lafayette! - You don't have a car. - I'm gonna get a car. - Lafayette? - How? How can you get a car? What are you staring at? And who's that? What are you doing here? Come on. - I said come with me. - I heard you. I'm asking you, who is that woman? - Are you a friend of my Lafayette? - I ain't no Lafayette no more. - Don't bother her, all right? - What have you done to your head? Never mind. Just go on back home. Is that his child? - Look, don't be talking to her. - Is that your child? You wouldn't understand. What do you mean? Is that your child or isn't it? What kind of question is that? Maybe it is and maybe it isn't. What? I knew you wouldn't understand. You don't understand anything. I understand just fine. You explain it to me. Do you understand about cosmic consciousness and all kind of that shit? That's what I'm talking about, baby. All I'm talking about is Lafayette Junior here is your child. I just want to know if that's your child too. Never mind that. Come on. Come on! - Where are we going? - I'm taking you to the bus. - You're going back home. Come on! - I don't want to go home!

Baby, that's all you need to know. Why don't you just go home? I never said you couldn't help your friends, Lafayette. Goddamn it, woman! I ain't no Lafayette! Shit! Don't you understand nothing? How can people Be so heartless? How can people Be so cruel? Easy to be hard Easy to be cold How can people Have no feelings? You know I'm hung up on you Easy to be proud Easy to say no Especially people Who care about strangers Who care about evil And social injustice Do you only Care about the bleeding crowd? How about a needing friend? I need a friend How can people Be so heartless? How can they ignore their friends?

I'm not into any heavy preference trip, you know, like who the father is. I don't care. I think they're both beautiful. Don't you? But how can you not care about that? If a woman carries a child, don't you think she should know who the father is? Well, I admit that I have this dilemma. But it will be resolved real soon. It's not like a big crisis or anything. It's not like a world war. I don't know what you're so uptight about. I fell in love with someone. We had a child, and we were gonna get married. That's why I'm uptight. - Yeah? - And you're holding it up! No, I'm not holding it up. You don't see the way it is. This is really a great thing that's happened to all of us. Everybody's really happy about it. The guys are really happy. I think it would be great if you could be happy about it, too. - You're crazy. - Yeah, I'm crazy. We're all crazy. Let's shake on it. Let's not. Come on. If all you men could be standing where I'm standing and seeing what I'm seeing, you'd know how it feels to be truly proud of our country. The United States Army is the greatest fighting force in the world. And now, you men... ...are going to be thousands of miles away from home in a few days. And you'd better take some of that greatness with you. And this afternoon, while you're on leave, you'd better take some of it with you, too. Sergeant! Sergeant! Sergeant! Shut the damn thing off!
