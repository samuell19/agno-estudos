Find another job I'm going to talk to Luis let's see if he knows anything I think they needed someone for the dead file Sofi married very young she got pregnant when she was 19 who knows if it was a failure of the contraceptive method or a deliberate oversight Luis fulfilled his part and before the pregnancy was noticeable, they were married as psychologists would say Sofia's relationship was marked by the image of the absent father after the birth of her second daughter tried to revive his love life friend They are divine I can? No, in a few days they are perfect perfect, perfect do you think it's very important? But you're not man enough, asshole she didn't realize but the relationship was the same as the one my parents had and although Luis was always a good provider over time that was no longer enough Louis, where are you? I already called you 1000 times remember that you promised the girls girls talking to their father will come? You see? They are asking about you and stop making noise that if not, I can not speak but you didn't promise I did not promise anything you said that dad was coming to eat liar!

Who were you going to give it to? if you don't have friends I don't think you'll lose weight you are fat because you want to because you don't have willpower They will believe that in China I did not see a single fat person they were all skinny, with a very good figure and that they ate some very strange things The food is ready excellent to eat It smells delicious It looks like it was delicious "I stay" these chinos are so cute as babies and then they get so ugly Mommy "Brownie" is asleep let's see she's dead fool Luciana don't talk to your sister like that Ramona is dead you killed her Ramona sorry. I did not know poor bitch, it was the only company of my daughters How was I supposed to know the dog was there? sorry of course, with so much fat my cushions, god fed up, I was fed up I felt like I was falling down a deep black hole. and the only light that was seen at the end it was the one on my fridge as usual I looked for a sign that my destiny was going to change and yes it arrived "fresh of the day"? that? "El fresco" Oh thank you Ramona I already got your exams and I don't have very good news for you as a doctor? You you know it's contraindicated remove more than 10% of body fat of a patient?

Do I have heart problems? Well no, we should do tests on it but we assume given your obesity doctor I need to lose weight to get a job we recommend you lose weight first and then operate I mean, is he telling me that I'm very fat? for me to do liposuction no no please this clinic is spectacular it is in front of the sea you seclude yourself there for three months and they take care of supervising you The 24 hours of the day or so nothing else He charged me a fortune to tell me I'm fat Well you are paying for a treatment that is just beginning and it's very good to start but now it is in your hands to change be a new person better mire, doctor I am very aware of how I am very aware that's exactly why I'm here because I do know, I do know that I'm fat i got out of there Convinced that it was useless to lose my money neither in diets nor in health gurus I am fat and period I was lost in my thoughts when a detail caught my attention the blessed signs that are around you have to let yourself be carried away by them open the door for us new experiences Good afternoon Do you want to know the past? Understand your present? Reveal the future? cards? Coffee? Tarot? we have special price letters And yes, I feel like a coffee, but does it have cookies? No, this is not a pastry shop And what are these for?

Can it be my sister? A sister what's your sister's name? Sofi Sofi I don't know could be an "s" but but can also be an "r" Do you know someone whose name starts with r? Women Pink? Will it be Rosa? Pink yes it can be pink but it can also be Sofi it's two o'clock But Sofia why? let me see envy But why would Sofi envy me? I mean if it's a scorpion and well, you know what scorpions are like and well, I do have a better complexion and I dress much better but how strange what I do? Do you really want to do something? Because destiny is already written and only a superior force can change it I can help you But I need you to want it with everything, everything all your heart Yeah oh poor of your friend This beetle was brought to me from far away It's already ready" can fulfill any wish no matter how strange it suffers how much does it cost? it's expensive but effective I don't do this for business it would be 3000 pesos and why so much?

Be honest, a fat woman can't be happy mom, it doesn't matter fat, skinny, it's the same I've been skinny all my life and I've seen it Very difficult I don't want to imagine what it has been for you no mom, the only thing I wanted since I was a child, it is that you loved me just as i am but daughter, if I have done everything because I love you yeah, I love you too but you have a very strange way of showing it it hurts a lot that you have not found someone with whom share your life mom, that's not important you had my dad and they didn't talk and look at Sofia but it is important to have a man by your side a man to help you let the supermarket load you look, if you have it better but you don't need it to be a woman is Juanita you really are inopportune as you see?

Yeah I'm going to work another while Well, I can't wait for you because I'm very bad give more than what is expected of us being kind and loving is also a decision I would have liked to share these reflections with Julio and the venue? He found a very cheap place in a very difficult area Ramona, you spent looking for days and days you give too much importance all this was going to happen with or without the beetles there is one that I did not tell you after putting the one i put in forever young I put one in your house so you could see me I already saw you but in reality, talking was not our thing hello memories are tricky go Go good we also decide what to remember and what to erase from our memory how pretty it's yours the course of life does not depend on an amulet you like me? And always we can do something different to change things you behave well Yeah will you accompany me to work? no, not crazy I'm leaving then kisses once you swore to me that we would always be together What is the moral of this story: life is like a good cookie recipe you have to beat 100g of luck and 100g of hope mix very delicately half a kilo of decisions and bake mom, don't put cappuccino, it's very expensive It doesn't matter, we're on sale customers have to be happy this is going to be full of gossipy women sitting three hours alone with a coffee mom, we ran out of cookies stop eating that if they are not going to get like their aunt they are for the baskets tell your aunt ramona to give you more Grandma says that if they give us those cookies of the "love" right now they're coming out thanks Juanita shouldn't let her sister and her mom they order it so much Juanita, for me the owners of the place feel so I just come to bake and it gives me time to have fun more photo shoots? Almost every day and next time I invite you I don't know Miss Ramona Won't young Julio be scared? he loves that he brings people Well, if so, then yes. Of course, you have to put a personal stamp on every recipe I add a little love a hint of smiles and the right amount of eroticism because finally be happy it's a choice well I'm leaving because I have a date with Fridman How with Fridman? Mom again? Oh how barbaric you are, really is that you blame him
