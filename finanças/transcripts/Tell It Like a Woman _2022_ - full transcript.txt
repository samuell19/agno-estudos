So beautiful. Fucking damn this shit. I can't have my baby on this wall. Right here. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Shut the fuck up, Kim. I'm over that shit. I wish I could, Pepcy. I wish I could. What's up, homie? Hey, you all good? Fuck off. I'm applying for rehab. You want to try too? They got, like, 100 slots. What's that? Three thousand inmates. That's the fucking... that's the fucking lottery. I'm a numbers girl. My odds ain't shit. Shut the fuck up! I ain't going to tell your ass no more. Shut the fuck up. At least you got one thing going for you. What? You're a 100% bona fide drug addict. Fuck you, Phyllis. You might as well try. Take a drug test, what? Every damn day? That is, that's, that, that, that would be bullshit. Hmm. Yeah, motherfucker, that's some bullshit. They say 90% of the people that graduate the program... ...don't come back in here. How do you like them, numbers girl? -Debra, why you smiling so hard? You getting out? -Mm-hmm. But I want to try something different this time. The number 86 is -Maricela Lopez. -That's fucking me! -She probably took my name out. -No, they didn't it. She didn't even want to do it. -I know this-- I know. -See you, bitches! Alright. Number 87 is Kimberly Carter. -Shit. -That's you! They're calling your name. Get up there! Go, go! Nobody needs this more than you, Pepcy. Don't mess it up. It isn't fair that I can't see my kids. They put me so far away. Mi mama can't afford to bring them. You should have thought about your damn kids while your dumb ass was out there selling dope! Calm, calm down. What? Bitch, what? What are you crying about? You should be crying about your own baby. Bitch, say it. - Fuck you crying for? Tears ain't helped nobody! - Alright, ladies, - we're gonna take five minutes earlier. - -Hey, that's enough. - You'll go back in solitary. - Get off me! -I'm going no-fucking-where. -Two minutes. Two! - Get off of me! - Give me two minutes. -You saw what she just did! -Two minutes, Javi. -Crap. -Don't touch me like that! Take a breath, Kim. Breathe. -You don't run this, bitch, I do. -Breathe. -Kim. -Your bitch ass. Sit. Sit, sit. You've been hurt. So bad. Your walls are so thick... ...we can't penetrate them. What happened to you? What happened to me? Kim... My mom would... -She would leave me upstairs... -Shut up, Kim. ...when she had to go to work, or, or, or when she would go to parties. The neighbor, Shelly... ...was my babysitter. I was five. Mm-hmm. And she would... ...she would snuggle with me. And she would give me beers. And she told me not to tell my mommy. It would be our little secret. Shut up, Kim. She gave me a Barbie doll, so I gave her a big old hug. She said I, she said I hugged her so hard, that I hurt her tittie... ...and that I should, I should kiss it, and make it feel better. She pushed her tittie up to my mouth and she told me to, - to suck it. - Shut up! - Shut up. - And... ...to pull down her panties. Get off of me. What the fuck happened to me? When I was a teenager... ...I met Rico... ...the neighborhood dope dealer. One day, we're sitting... That motherfucker! We're sitting on an old car seat. We're in the house. And this son of a bitch... ...I don't even know who the fuck he was... ...Johnny from the Jungle, come and sit his ass right next to me. Then he had the nerve to force himself... -Shut up! -...on me. Then three more... ...three more motherfuckers lined up... ...touching on me and shit. All of them, they laughing. They all fucked up. And they got the nerve to put their motherfucking hands on me. What gave them the right... ...to do me like that? Let it go. Yes, baby, let it go. Let it go. Okay, let it go. Yes. We are not going to try to push God... ...or happiness on you. And to be the best you, you can be. -Always. -We have to find our higher power, right? Yes. Yo, you're doing a good job. Kim, you're doing great. But 90 days wasn't enough for you. You need more mental health counseling, and you need to check into a residential program for at least six months. -With curfews and shit? -Of course! And lots of rules. But the good news is I checked in on your mom, and she's in a really good place, and prepared to continue to take care of your child while you're recovering. If you decide to do this, I need you to sign these papers. Why are you fucking with me? You finally get yourself out of prison and put your dumb ass back in another one? - ...I gained a few pounds. - Oh, no, you look pretty. And just remember to breathe through it all. Breathe. -I got this. -You got this. - I got it. I got it. - I got it. I got it. Just yank on it. Just don't look like no motherfucking program van. It's a piece of shit. And them ain't no motherfucking program people, neither. Can't argue with that. They some health care professionals? That bitch ain't no fucking health care professional. You don't see this shit? You really think they taking you to a fucking program? You forgot what I taught you. Motherfucking game don't stop. Laurie told me. Alright. Am I... Girl, you alright? Motherfucker, you alright? ...any of this shit. What if we hop out the door when, when they pull over? They get no handles on these doors. Dumbass, they ain't let nobody jump the fuck out of here. Leave a body on the freeway in the damn public. They'll take your dumb ass to the woods. Nobody won't hear me out of here. They going to kill you! What are you doing? Bitch. Who you going to take down first? I ain't scared of no women. I've taken down women bigger than that before. No, shit! Bet. I'm going to go for the man. I could just jump out the window when we stop at a red light. - Bet. - -I'm going for this motherfucker at this red light and I can fuck these motherfuckers up. If they try to stop you, if they try to put their hands on you, you know what to do. Shit! You see this shit? This is it. They about to kill you. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. You know what to do. -Fuck them up. -Go for that man. Go for that man. Grab that ponytail. Watch that bitch right there too. Get that shit, Kim. Motherfuckers ain't looking. Why don't you get your ass up there and get the keys? Because we ain't going to no woods. Make your move! -Stick them or run into the woods. -Shit! Hey, Kim! I knew you were coming today. Debra? From Barnaburg? Yeah. I'm the receptionist here now. Uh, come on inside, we've got a special room for you. It's padded. I'm just kidding. Let me help you out. Get your ass back here! I said, Kim! Kim! Remember what I taught you. The fuck is you raising your hand up at me for? Bitch, I made you. Get your ass back here! Right now! You need me! You need me! Come back here! Come back! I am the real Kim Carter. And where would I be if I didn't have that second chance? Everybody needs a second chance. But when I got mine, I took it and I ran with it. I ran so far, I'm standing here before you today. Twenty-eight years clean and sober. The organization that I founded has helped 305 children come from foster care back with their moms. As a matter of fact, we've helped over 1700 women reach self-sufficiency. Now, I wasn't able to be there for my daughter when she was young, but I do, I get to repay that back 'cause I help these women be there for theirs. Got the antibiotics? -Got the Narcan? -Yes. Have you eaten lunch today? -I got an extra. -Ah, thanks. I'm starving. - Yeah. - Had to skip breakfast because I did an early morning Botox. - What? -I didn't tell you about my side-hustle? Pay my neighbor a couple of shots in his backyard. - Wait, the hot surfer? - Mm-hmm. - And he brought me some more artisanal chocolate. Alright, if Glacier's here, we got to check in on him, - then we've got Maria. - Uh-huh. I got a birth control refill with me. We can do that before we dress Val... Hey! But we have a problem, Doctor P. - Val! - Oh, yeah. - What's the problem now? - The cleaning staff is refusing to go into her room. They're scared. Val has way too many mental issues. She's not appropriate for this place. - Schizophrenia-- - Okay, let's go talk to her. She's filthy, she doesn't shower, she doesn't change her clothes, she goes into off-limit areas or just trash. We'll go talk to her. Uh, we'll clean her up, get her in the shower. - Promised. - -I'm going to follow up later. - Can I borrow this? - Oh, yeah. Go ahead. Thanks! Maybe grab that too. Yo, you looking for Val? - Yeah. - -I just saw her up on the roof. Don't tell anybody, okay? Oh. She's not supposed to be up there. I want to see the arm where the wire -went into her skin. -Yeah. Hey, Val! Hey! Doctor P and nurse Tamika. I have to check on your arm. - Leave me alone. - I can't, Val. It's my job to check up on you, so you can stay in the hotel. Hey! I brought your cheese puffs. Prove it. Hey, Tamika. You've only been with us for a couple of weeks now, so... If you want, you can wait out here and I can handle it. Cool, cool. I, I'll be over here playing Candy Crush. - Okay. - Are you crazy? You're not going in there without me. Alright then. -Can you get that? -Yeah. Alright. We'll clean this up! Can you help us? I can't really walk. My layers are too tight. Okay. Well, we can take care of all that once we get this cleaned up, Val. It's Validation! Call me by my name. Okay. Let's have this all kind of organized. Kitchen. That's nice. I'm going to help you clean up the kitchen. This can go in the pantry. Pans in the dishwasher. So, Validation, can I come into your room here? That goes in there. She needs this. - Well, it looks great, right? - It does. - It does. - Okay. Uh, Val, now what we have to do is we've got to see the, your arm - where the wire went into your wound. Remember I took the wire out last week? We just need to make sure it's filled up. Uh... Okay, so we're gonna have to take your clothes off. Uh-uh. I can't take this off because I need it for protection. Protection from what? Street. But you're not on the street anymore. - I got you off the street. - -Yeah, you're in a nice hotel. I actually used to party up here, so they wrapped it all in plastic. That is the sound of a fish chocking on a plastic bag. Hey. I'm an eco-warrior too. Okay, here. It's okay. It's okay. We're just gonna unwrap this one layer at a time. Okay? And then you can tell us how you feel. There we go. Okay. Let's get this down. We need to cut the sleeve so I can get to the wound. Okay? No, no, I'll wait. I'll wait till I get new clothes. Do you want me to go downstairs and get you some fun new clothes? Yeah. Okay, great. Then I'm, I'm gonna s-- I'm gonna snip this off. Take the jacket off. You want to sit down over here for me? Uh... Oh. A coat hanger. You've got to stop using wire to wrap yourself. That's how you get infected. Sorry, Doctor P. Yeah. I'm just gonna pull this... Hold on. Okay. I need to get these, I need to get these layers also. Let me take your coconut. Okay, just lean forward a little bit. Tamika, let's stand foul up. Arms up. There you go. Alright. You know what? Just gonna cut this off. No, don't cut the bodysuit. - Bodysuit? What, you are Catwoman? - Meow. Hey, let's just turn around and see if we can just pull it up over. Alright, let's get this off here. - Don't cut the bodysuit. - Hey. - Ooh. - It was all frayed. It's okay. But these are old and frayed. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I need to get you another one. I'm going to get you another one. Just tie-dye sparkly. Alright? There we go. There we go. It's okay. It's okay. Okay, there we go. Okay. Can you, can you sit down? There we go. Okay. Okay. It's not as bad as I thought. Okay. Yeah, you just need to breathe a little, right? You have to take better care of yourself, Validation. Right. I... I used to take care of everyone. My all family. My mom. My mom. Her dark hair and pink sweater. It's okay. I understand. This pandemic is really hard on everybody. -But you want to get cleaned up, right? -No. - Come on, let's get this off. Keep going. Seen this? But just don't cut Dodgers. - I won't cut the Dodgers. - Soy sauce? Oh. Okay. - I want you to go down and take a shower. And you got some fun new clothes. We'll be waiting for you downstairs. Go get cleaned up. That was... ...the stinkiest job I've ever done. Oh, thank God you said that. I was hoping this wasn't normal. Plus you were all up in that sandbox. - You're ready? - I'm ready. Alright. ♪ Every day I tell myself ♪ ♪ I'm drowning in wishing well ♪ ♪ Every day you fill me up with hope ♪ ♪ Then I remember ♪ ♪ Oh, your love is the dope ♪ ♪ For me ♪ ♪ Boy ♪ ♪ You ♪ - Okay. Just let me read you one more. - We don't have time -for this. -"Ana Ackerman is transforming the shape of the world as we know it." -Mark, you're gonna miss your flight. -I won't. ArchDaily says, "Charming her way to the top." -Can we move on? -For Dezeen, you're the most - provocative architect of the decade. This is a breakthrough for you and our studio. Okay. -I'm forwarding you the links. -Hey, hey, I've got go. It's Serpentine calling. - Margaret! - Ana! I was just informed a family matter came up and you had to leave London. Yea. Briefly. Look, I'll be back tomorrow night, and Mark is on his way there as we speak. We'll need you to give the inaugural speech, though. No, I know that. Of course. Look, Margaret, we agreed no photos before the inauguration. -The pavilion isn't even finished yet. -I know. Somebody must have leaked them. There's been so much interest, - it's impossible to keep a lid on it. Okay. Hey, Margaret. Hang on a minute. - Vic. - I have Leslie Weiss -from The Washington Post. -Shit. I forgot. -Look, I've got to cancel. -We've already canceled three times. -It's Sunday's front page. -I know. I, I can't do it right now. Shit! Hey, babe. Hey, are you there yet? -Yeah, I'm on my way. -You okay? It's crazy. Everything's crazy and nobody gives a shit. Let your team handle it. - I spoke to Mark on his way to the airport. You're gonna have to trust them on this one. You'll likely be staying a couple of days and I don't think it's a good-- -I don't have a couple of days. -Well, you're already there, so you might as well slow down. Put the house and the tavern on sale, there's no one left there anyway. Yeah, um, I've got to take this call. Okay? Okay. You don't recognize me, do you? I'm Gianni Chiossone. They sat you next to me when you arrived at the school... -Ah! -...in the middle of the second grade. -Do you remember? -Yeah. Can I see her? Did she suffer? I don't think so. -Her blood tests show a cocktail of substances. -She never learned how to swim. Lena doesn't know yet. Who's Lena? Your sister's daughter. Sara had a daughter? She should hear it from you. Where's the father? There's no father. I'm all she's got. I've looked after her since she was a baby. And you. Now, she's got you. Sara arranged everything. Arranged what? The legal papers. Sara said if anything happened to her, I should call Mr. Fassano. I don't have a couple of days. I leave tomorrow, so let's just talk now. This is not the right time or place. I don't know what she was thinking, but this is impossible. It's a delicate matter. I'm aware. But, Sara, like your mother, she had her moment of clarity, and she knew that something like this could happen. And she also knew you are the best option for Lena. Lena doesn't know me. I don't know Lena. What was she thinking? Why would she make me her guardian? -I can't do this. -And you are the only family she's got. Family? Don't lecture me about family. You didn't grow up with a bat-crazy mother and a loony sister. Why do you think I left? Why do you think I never came back? Why do you think I didn't have children of my own? Because of them! Just... Just prepare the paperwork because I'm leaving. Do you mind finishing? -Oh, I-- -I'll fix you two some dinner. Oh. Sorry. Lena! Okay. No. Lucas, listen. Listen, I need to see the final projected image. Uh, no, I'm just gonna wrap everything up here. Alright. Tell Vic I'll call him later. I'll be sleeping over tonight. It's late and we live far away. Yeah, of course. Can I talk to you, Carmen? Um... We can't leave Lena's fate in the hands of a judge. It's just not an option. She loves you. You love her. You've watched over her since she was a baby. -You've protected her-- -Sara never did Lena any harm. No, of, of course not. That came out wrong. What I'm trying to say is I had a mother like Sara, so I know what it's like. Look, I... ...can support you financially. I can wire you money every month for Lena, for you, for your children. You would never have to work again. You could move in here with your family. -That's not possible. -Why not? I thought it's perfect. Lena gets to stay in her home, in her hometown with people who love her, with family and siblings. I am not her family. You are her family. I can't do this. I have a whole life I've got to get back to. A life without children. We don't always get to choose the life we live. Do you think I chose to clean other people's houses, to watch over Sara, who constantly wanted-- Who was out of her mind. No. She was a sad soul. And she was always that way. And even if I agreed, they would never give me legal custody and I could lose my own children if I enter into the system. You're offering me a dream, but I cannot take it. I promised Sara I'll watch over Lena. And this is my way of doing so. By putting her on the hands of her family. Tomorrow morning, I'll stop by the lawyer's office and sign whatever I have to sign, and then I guess I'll deal with the house later. I can't stay, I can't stay, the inauguration is tomorrow. I've worked my entire career for a moment like this, and you think I'm just gonna blow it off? I suppose she'll appear in front of a judge once Carmen hands her over. I don't know what's gonna come of her. It's not my responsibility. Lena? Lena. Ah. Okay. Whoo! Whoo! Mm-hmm. Hmm. Ooh. Mm-hmm. Oh. Hm. Mm-hmm. It hurts? It hurts? He's in pain. What happened? The wound is very deep. Did he cut himself? She asked the name. Nan. His name is Nan. Do you have any kids? Yes. A girl. You apply this twice a day, and-- Shit! Shit! Stop! Stop. Stop. Stop! No! I really don't want to eat khichdi again. Well, then you wake up early and you tell the cook what you want. But you have one job, at least plan it properly, no? "But you have one job, at least plan it properly." Oh my God, look at you. -What happened to you? -Guys, not now. - Wow, looks like you had quite the night. All flushed. Huh. Divya, were you careful, no? Go have a bath before you catch an infection. He didn't drop you back or what? The new episode just came out. And Park Bo-gum is... so hot. You know these Korean boys? They're so pretty. - I mean, I can have them in my bag and eat them. - Call Gauri and tell her the injections are still stuck in customs. If that rep Bea Pharma rep comes by the office, I'm not interested in his products. Also send a bouquet of flowers to Rajan with a note saying I will not be able to speak at the seminar. Write it down, Anu. Oh, my God, Anu. What's wrong with you? Get it together! Why can't you be more like-- I'm doing it, I'm doing it. God, your hair is so messy. Tie it up. This is too tempting. Stop. Go back. Can you guys stop it? What do you think you're doing? Guys, please, stop it, will you? Guys, just... No, don't touch me, don't touch-- No! Stop it! Stop it! You know I don't like being touched! Jesus. Ok, listen, listen. Baby, listen. So, I have three millions for my fixed deposit, okay? Um, mom's going to give me another two. Yeah, she's going to give me another two, I need another one point five, and I need this jaw fixed before Sanjay's surprise party. I need it! I don't believe you're talking me out of it. I've got my clothes in place. Jewelry, shoes, everything is set. Hello, I've got the money arranged. Hm? -I need to do my job. -Why don't you treat yourself to a nice luxurious holiday? -Holiday? -Yeah. Why are you talking me out of it? -We can take a holiday later together! -Yes, yes. -Yeah?
