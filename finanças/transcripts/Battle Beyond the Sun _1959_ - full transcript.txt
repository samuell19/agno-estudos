Excuse me, please. - There's someone to see you. - Who? Comrade Troyan of The Writers Union. You said that you promised to see him. Yes, I promised, indeed. Invite him in. - May I? Yevgeni Petrovich, you, of course, can guess. I want to write about you. People who explore space. About your life, your job. Must disappoint you. There's nothing interesting yet. No romantic plots, no fascinating adventures. Work. Persistent work. blueprints and mathematics. Please, this way. - Look. - A space ship? - A sketch. - But it's interesting. I dream to be one of the first passengers on that ship. I don't think that will happen anytime soon. Pardon me for saying but Tsiolkovski said that our generation will take ships to neighbouring planets. I see you prepared extremely well. So you've come to take a small walk in space. - Meet our engineer. - Gordienko. - Troyan. - A writer. Understood. Please, come in. This is the first. This the second satellite, we can say. - It's light? Please, this way. - This is the third one? - That's right. Don't touch. - Sorry. - Please, this way. Well, what do you think? You like it? Of course. - What is it? - A space station. Eternal, artificial satellite of Earth. It will rotate far from Earth. How far? - A few dozen. - Of what? thousands of kilometres, of course. - Tell me what are these dishes? - Helio stations. Observatory. Fuel tanks. In this ring there will be... labs and living quarters. But it's possible that this can be a hotel for businessmen. I imagine there wouldn't be just a few. - Look here. - What is this? These are letters. Letters from fans of space. Doctors, pioneers, engineers, miners write. In a word all ages and all professions. Here is a letter. This one is written by a "mature" person. He is already 13 years old. A Boy Scout. Very "experienced". He wrote that he's flown on a plane, a helicopter-- And now he wants to fly in a rocket? He demands it. The latest space fashion. Meet, our film operator, Aleksandr Listopad. The costume is elegant. And moreover reliable. It protects from the cold of space and the sun. And a visor to protect from the sun. You want to try it on? - Me? Sasha, feels in the day like he's in his pyjamas. There you are. You can't hear anything. And he can communicate only with the help of a radio. Please meet our doctor, Elena Mikhailovna. - Are you going to test? - Lena. Excuse me for a moment. - Lena, are we still on? - Yes, of course. - Only don't be late. Excuse me, may I participate in the testing? Yes. Please do. There is still so much I don't understand. But after spending days in the Space Institute Has already transported me into the future. Really, the people of today and myself will be witnesses to eternal dream of humanity: to fly into space? Be careful. Mother, what, again? You already promised, don't cry. - Olga, don't worry. - I'm not crying. I'm just afraid. Andrei, look after her. And you don't get a cold. Yes. They say that around the stars is very windy. Well, Andrei, be healthy. Well, that's all. That's all. There's no need, Vera. There's no need. But it is so unexpected. Kiss the children. Can you move a little to the right? Maybe you can take off the cover. Cover? Yes, of course. Tell me, what is your name? I'm Aleksandr. A film operator. I want to film a story about the space station. And you? - I... . - You are a science worker. What made you decide that? Your magazine has such complicated design drawings, that it makes my head spin. I am a student. I'm flying for practice to the space station's observatory. What is this? This is the subject of my dissertation. The study of small space objects. What we call like asteroids. Nervous? A little. We can go back. It isn't too late. What are you talking about? But there in our "sky shop" it's so "hot". I don't believe it. Attention. Be prepared. Navigation station: Verify readiness for start. I'm ready to receive. Komandorski Islands, ready. Khabarovsk, ready. Bratsk, ready. Novosibirsk, ready. Kuibyshev, ready. - Leningrad, ready. - Kharkov, ready. - Moscow, ready. - Kiev, is now ready. Attention. Giving permission to start. FLIGHT 17. EARTH - SPACE STATION: ALL ACCORDING TO SCHEDULE AND PLAN. Welcome. Help me. You've forgotten to wear your magnet shoes. Ship. I congratulate you. I'm jealous. Vasily Andreyevich, we promise to send you a radio transmission everyday: Attention, attention speaking from space. - Kind of you. - Of course, only for a voice from Earth. Of course. By the way, about a path. Our service predicts a meeting here. - You can meet the meteors here. - The meeting is not pleasant. We will try it as safely as possible. Well, this is the last step of the preparations. We require engineer Gordienko. I know I'm waiting for him. Vasiliy Matveevich, Somebody wants to speak with you. - Open it. - Here it is. The correspondent of a large media corporation Astronaut, sportsman. He's an important person. Interesting to listen to him. Let's listen. Good evening, Mr. Demchenko. Very pleased to meet you. Excellent. And I am very glad to meet you Mr. Verst. Klark and I have decided to make a small trip into space. Is it possible for you to receive our rocket to the space station? Next Thursday. You're welcome. The space station is open for all. I am grateful to you. Until our meeting... - On your "moon". - You want to go back to Earth? - No, I want to go to the stars. - I'm very glad. - Why? Since you don't want to go below that means no one is waiting for you. - Well, now I want to go to Earth. - Why? Because, here's no place to escape from you. I thank for the meeting and for the pleasant reception. But we are businessmen, and allow me to speak this table about work. Please, Mr. Verst. Business is business. First of all, I wanted to tell you about the aim of our visit. Klark and I have decided to trek to Mars. Yes, gentlemen. We are flying to Mars. Well, from the bottom of my heart I wish you luck. I thank you. You know, with you message, you've made us seriously interested. For such news any our reporter would pay a lot. This is news with a capital N. And you know, I was just about to tell you this news but then... I just recalled, fortunately, your impressive tradition: At first, do it and then later the story. - Correct? - Of course. Continue. You think that I am full of stories? Allow me to make a request. For the mission to Mars, we wanted to use the launch pad from your space station. Please, please do, we are ready to help out. And we are always pleased with fellow travellers. We are also flying to Mars. Are you joking? Not at all. The ship. Please this way. But why didn't you announce the flight? That is also a very remarkable tradition, Mr. Verst. First do it and then the story. Or as they say in Ukraine: First jump and then think about the consequences. - When do you start? - If it's not a secret. We are waiting for necessary positions of the planets. According to our calculations the start time will be Wednesday, next week. And you when? Our take off day is a secret even for us, it's in the sealed envelope. Well, it's already late. All the best. - Goodnight. I must contact Harting. I hate this news. And you think Harting will like it? - Yes? Please. - May I? - I'm not bothering you? - No, please have a seat. We've both heard about each other forever. - And this is the first meeting. - Let's get to know one another closer. You are an astronaut. I'm an astronaut. Yes, I've read a lot about you. I have wanted to ask you for a long time... Ask. How could you land on a rocket at El Paso? By my calculations you should have passed El Paso and have landed -- near Japan. That's what it cost me. I was howling from the pain but I put on the brakes. I put on the brakes just to land at El Paso even if I crashed. - Your mother? - Yes. She is my guardian angel. When my father died and we lost everything... I was a kid at that time, my mother dedicated her whole life to me. She made me what I am. That was harder than flying to the moon. I repeat Mr. Verst, don't stop. You will proceed quickly. Mr. Harting, as far as I understand-- You understand nothing. The navigation station would receive the order to recalculate everything. We can not risk wasting anymore time. But we risk lives. That is your duty. No more arguments. Mr. Klark, you know that we are flying to Mars. Between Earth and Mars we've inserted a radio connection. And using this you can easily control your course. I don't understand you. We are opponents in ground-breaking competition. And you are worried that I don't lose? We have a great task. To open a path to other planets. To increase our knowledge of other worlds. To make space serve the people of Earth. Isn't that wonderful? If I tell Mr. Harting about that... ... he will send me away to a mental hospital. And if you tell Mr. Harting that we are joining forces in order to achieve our common aim. He will also put you into a mental hospital? No, he would put me to jail. This is just between us, Mr. Kornev. A pity. It's a pity that between us is a barrier and not friendship, Mr. Klark. - Understand, we must fly. - I wish you luck. Mr. Kornev. - Well, fellow, we fly. - What? Yes, and quickly. Harting yelled such that it wasn't even necessary for the radio. If we fly with the planets in such a position... ... there might not be enough fuel. But if we will be second in this competition, we won't be flying to Mars, but to hell. What's wrong, Robert? Forgotten how to take risks? You want to teach how to take risks again? Get ready. Mr. Somov, we are taking off. Why so suddenly? It's an order. Wait a moment. I must call ground control. No time. See you soon on Mars. Immediately leave the take-off platform, we are taking off. Faster, Robert. Harting will give the order to start, but we aren't ready. But he should be warned about danger. Robert, God be with you. Attention. Ignition. Sensation in space. Typhoon has gone to Mars. The stars are winking at our countrymen. The Big Bear constellation is waving with its paw to Verst and Klark. Today poor. Tomorrow a millionaire. Buy land on Mars. It's so, so cheap. Only with the Space Syndicate. Ten dollars an acre. Ten dollars a acre. Buy land on Mars. Ladies and gentlemen, drink this space cocktail. The firm guarantees after the second glass You can achieve the condition of total weightlessness. And you can produce only one sound: Drink. Drink. Drink. Two glasses and you're in space. Every 30 minutes we will repeat this transmission. From our special correspondent Herman Verst who is aboard the ship travelling to Mars. Listen to Herman Verst. We've passed the first million kilometres. No-one's disturbed the proud flight of our rocket. The sun is similar to a red-headed girl. Smiling and welcoming... our victory in space. So what do you say? To risky for a story, I don't understand it. Listen. We have to speak with Somov. It's better if you do it. Understood. - How do you feel? - A little uncomfortable. But I'm ready to fly as of today. You-- Why, Yevgeni Petrovich? I am completely healthy. Really, Gregory? Elena Mikhailovna, tell them what you think. Gregory Vasilivich, you can't fly, not tomorrow or the day after. After such trauma, you have to stay in bed. - But Elena Mikhailovna... - I'm a doctor. Another must fly. We will not risk your life. Andrei Gordienko will fly. I didn't think that it would be so hard to part. I also didn't think. I forgot something, but what?... . Don't be angry but it seems to me that you aren't upset about being apart. Even glad. Lena, I'm upset. Honestly, I'm upset. I see. And understand. - And forgive you. But I'm so afraid for you. Everything will be all right. We'll return. It's time. Goodbye. Goodbye, Andrei. Goodbye, take care of yourself. Have a safe journey, Yevgeni Petrovich. Get well. Here, Yevgeni, soil from your native land. Let it always be with you. Thank you. - Check the instruments. - Instruments are in order. - Get ready. Nervous? Nervous. Attention. Take-off position. Moscow speaking. The Soviet people congratulate you on the space ship "Motherland"... What are the instruments showing? Just a second. Radiation? What is this, Yevgeni Petrovich? - Amulet? - Talisman. You have a talisman? Soil from my native land, Andrei. Our Earth. - By the way, you haven't forgot? - What? We have a date today. Yes, a date with your old friend, wait, I'm initiating, one second. Hello, tribesman. Young and unknown friend. Hello, dream. Yevgeni Petrovich, that is also your baby? This is flying our youth. You'll hear from me again in one hour. Damn the fool who created these advertising transmissions. This means, old fellow, I'm extremely tired. My imagination is finished. Where can I find some news? You need a story, Verst? There it is. We're off course. You are out of your mind, Robert. Nobody believes you. Our navigation system is out of its mind. It's let us down. What? - Are you joking, Robert. - I'm not joking, Herman. We are off course and instead of Mars, we are headed towards the sun. Look, isn't that news? What are you waiting for? Do something. We've already gone through the one third of fuel tank. What will happen? - Robert? - Calm down. We will try to figure it out. Sit down. Accelerate the engine. Get into start position. - Start ready. - Ignite. Mars. SOS signal. Who is it? Typhoon speaking. We're in trouble. Our coordinates according to the star Sirius are 24 point 5. 97 point 3. Help us. Typhoon speaking. The distance to Typhoon? Twelve point four. Meteor Belt? The density of the meteor belt has increased. Fuel? Acceleration will be high, Yevgeni Petrovich. - We'll take the risk. - Of course. People are in danger. Set a course to Typhoon. Send a message to Earth... ... we are coming to the rescue. Turn on the radar. - Attention. - Get into start position. Engage. Power up the engine. This is Typhoon. Help us. We are heading towards the sun. Why is no one answering? The emergency signal. No, Herman, that is a new danger signal. We are entering a meteor shower. What's going to happen? That is a question, old fellow, I can answer that only in heaven. Death. To live.. Motherland speaking. We are coming to help you. Hold on. Don't loose hope. Typhoon speaking. Can you hear me? Quickly, move to a distance from us. We are in a meteor shower. We-- Move to a distance. Can you hear me? Say hello to Earth and shake its hand. Well, will we take the risk? What are you saying? Herman Verst, that's all. This is the end. What's wrong with you? I knew you were a man. I have no regrets. Only my dear mother waits for me. Moscow speaking. Listen to an emergency message. The Soviet space ship Motherland, is flying to help the ship Typhoon. - That's them? - I am so worried. - And me, too. How many years have I been worried. And die with him. You see? He's still alive. Attention. Bring us in closer. Get ready. Yevgeni Petrovich. I'm ready. Perhaps I'll go, Andrei? You are the head of the ship. - Remember... Careful and once more careful. All right, until later. I'm off. Yes, this is what I was afraid of. What is it, Yevgeni Petrovich? We have used up too much fuel. Why are they silent? What's happened? Is it something terrible? I don't believe it. Vasiliy Matveevich, wonderful news. Only I don't know whether to smile or cry. We have used up all our reserves of fuel. The landing on Mars seems to be ending in catastrophe. We found an asteroid, Icarus, that is crossing the orbits of Mars and Earth. We approached it and landed on it. So Earth has received our message. They are sending us an unmanned rocket with a reserve of fuel. Yevgeni Petrovich. On those rocks we will install a radar for the rocket. Attention. Satellite, acknowledge if you are ready. The satellite is ready to be sent in an unmanned rocket to Icarus. Giving the order to take off. Mars. There it is. The famous Martian canals. It's insulting. We have travelled a million kilometres and we stop right at the gate. You know, in the depth of your hearts you hate us. Let this be a cruel but useful lesson about useless competitions. Well, I think that's all. Let's sit. - Andrei. - Coming. Have a seat. What's up? What, Yevgeni Petrovich? Please, take a glass. My dear Andrei, this is a special day. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. I never thought I would ever celebrate my birthday in space. - We'll also celebrate your 25th wedding anniversary. - True. Friends, the Earth has sent us an unmanned rocket with fuel. To receive and attach the rocket to Icarus is a question of life and death. Prepare to receive the rocket. The rocket is on our radio waves. I hear you. Switching over to radio control. Sending a signal to break off. Maximum break. We have received an emergency message... The satellite observatory in space has observed a flash on Icarus. This flash matched the moment when the unmanned rocket landed on Icarus. Connection with the ship Motherland has ceased. It is obvious that the rocket failed to land on Icarus. Are you sad? - Yes. - Your bride is waiting? - Of course. Will the Earth notice our signal? - I don't know. - The idea is extraordinary... to build such an amazing bulb in a space vacuum. Pulkovo, 19th of June. Nothing was observed from Icarus. Crimean Observatory has nothing new to report. Delhi has picked up nothing. Los Angeles the same thing. Prague, nothing new. The Milan Observatory has also not picked anything up. Attention. The satellite Friendship speaking. In observing Icarus we noticed there was a light signal. The crew of the ship is still alive, that is what we've recorded: "The radar was destroyed, we cannot receive an unmanned rocket." Icarus is approaching Earth. Now we must think of some kind of help for the crew. Because later Icarus will go into the sun and then... We must immediately... Immediately find a way to help them. To return them to Earth. I know the way. Can you imagine, Herman, how it'd be interesting for Earth geologists to study theses pieces? Oh, you are still hoping to return to Earth. Why not? You, yourself, know. In a few days we will start to move away from it. Further and further. And then... news... Mr. Verst has died tragically in a space mousetrap. Mr. Kornev, I'm tired. To hell with the Earth. You send to hell our Earth, our mother land. And you, what? Grateful to Earth? Yes, I am grateful to the Earth. It armed me with knowledge. It has given me wings to space. And the most valuable of all... it teaches me... to bring happiness to people. It is a great honour... ... to be son of Earth. Well, Robinsons, have you met with Space Friday? Emptiness. Fly to the stars... . - Get changed and relax. Earth... - Andrei, your space suit. Gregory Somov. There, Yevgeni Petrovich. A rocket with fuel. Gregory. I can't understand... ... how did he manage to get here with an unmanned rocket. That is a thought we cannot understand. Perhaps he crossed the zone with an extreme explosion. And literally burned it out. We are ordered to return to Earth... Let's prepare ourselves. Thank you. I have imagined these people who saved my son's life. Attention. The ship Motherland is approaching the Earth's atmosphere. At a height of 280 kilometres, all systems are working properly. That's all, Vera. We are again together. - Smile. - You're more grey. - What about the children, are they healthy? - Of course. - It was difficult for you, Robert? - Yes, Mother But I've realised that people on Earth are better than I thought. Well, you are taking a vacation. Definitely... on Mars. You are a restless man. And you? Mr. Kornev, I want to thank you from all my heart. You not only saved our lives... ... you have made us believe in the power of human friendship. That I will never forget. That's all. Not very complicated? No, not very much. We are only spying on space. But after some time... ...people will own space. Safe journey, younger generation.
