Why with him? In essence, something bad happened which should make me fire him. What is wrong? You don't need to know. Too bad, he seems like a cool guy. Jessica, you're still very young. You have no experience with men. Even so, we will find a young driver again. It's better if the driver a little older right? Right, but the car is good and has advanced technology. My uncle's driver is good at that. His name is Uncle Kim. The person is very polite and calm. Since childhood I called him Uncle. - You know that kind of person? - Yes, his personality is very good.

People must be tired every day. At least enjoy silence in the car. thanks. You seem to master the road. The south road is not a problem for me. I have already driving for 30 years. I respect people who work long in one field. Actually a job it is very simple. I sent a family head. Company boss. Or just a lonely man, every morning crossing the streets with him. A kind of colleague relationship. I was excited all day long. Time also flies by. Your turning technique is very good. It's simple, this is a basic skill. He looks very friendly. Originally he was just an old weasel As if this is the house. That's right. He stayed the longest. She's the caregiver of the Namgoong family. Then continue serving the Diesterweg family. After family Namgoong moved Then came Park couple. "He's a good helper, hire him too." The owner changes, the maid stays the same. He is very loyal. To get rid of women that, need a mature plan. Yes, we need a good plan. I want to eat Peaches, my favorite fruit. Why not ask aunty? Our family does not eat peaches. Taboo. However, according to the Diesterweg family ... Aunt is allergic to peaches. You know fruit skin Peach as smooth as hair right? When nearby, his body will shiver Respiratory problems, asthma, and other serious symptoms. Not. There are no peaches at home. So When these symptoms appear, I immediately went to the room to take medicine. Because this is sudden, ... I do not remember at where I put the medicine. Ma'am. Who do you know the woman behind this. Our family's maid It is true. How to explain it ... I was not sure. I have seen 1-2 times in the living room.

He said he has Open Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Almost everyone hears, make people react. Tuberculosis? Impossible. I heard him say Tuberculosis. There are still people have tuberculosis? There are still people have tuberculosis? Father.. Won't buy a stamp anti-tuberculosis before Christmas? Sounds old-fashioned, right? But stay alert. South Korea is now a country The first OECD sufferers of tuberculosis. I think Aunt has the right to work. But if there are children like Da-Song at home, But if there are children like Da-Song at home, TB sufferers are in kitchen, cooking, spitting .. Do not continue! FATHER: 3 MINUTES AGAIN UNTIL THE HOUSE If there is an opportunity to add it will definitely be better. GO TO SPACE SAUNA FL. 2 DON'T UNTIL THE BIBI KNOWS Please sit.

Don't worry about that. I will not mention tuberculosis. I will find an excuse another to fire him. Simple reason. Experience teaches me. Those words. Did you wash your hands? Mr. Kim Do you know the delicious beef ribs? Just near here. - Have dinner then go home? - Yup. I don't know why today I want to eat beef ribs. Usually Auntie cooks. Trouble after you leave? My wife did not tell me why he left. It's not difficult to find new people. But it's a pity, Aunt is very proficient. Adept at taking care of the house. And very know how to balance. I hate people that transcends borders. Maybe only one problem. He eats too much. I heard he spent 2 servings with every meal After all, he had done a lot of things. Then you need to search immediately new person to take care of the house. Really troublesome. Just a week home already like a trash can. My clothes are starting to smell.

I'm ashamed. President Park. today I can eat again. Greetings! Do you do this every day? Yes, I sent it sentence of thanks. He must know right? What? Morse code. The light often blinks. Da-song Boy Scouts, he certainly understands. Don't you think it's weird? Why do we sometimes want to surrender to children. He is not the king's son. He is the youngest, will surely understand. Think about it. Da-song's problems are quite numerous. Trauma and moderate art therapy. Because something happened. Why? Do you believe in ghosts? A few years ago Da-song see ghosts in this house. When it was a birthday party. Midnight when everybody sleeps, Da-song quietly goes down to the kitchen and take out the leftover birthday cake from the fridge. The cake is very tasty, so before sleep he could not forget. Then he sat on the floor eating his cake. Suddenly there was a scream. I also rushed down. And she... His eyes rolled, convulsions, his mouth is foamy .. - Has your child ever had a seizure? - Not. If not handled in 15 minutes can damage the brain. Of course it needs more than 15 minutes to take him to the ER. All this time you lived in a place like this? Many South Koreans live underground. - Semi-Basement too. - What are your plans for the future? You don't have a plan? I'm very comfortable here. It feels like I was born here. As if married here. Retire in this place. At least there is my wife. Please allow me to live in this place. That's the story. At that time my husband was on work. So I was having a hard time. Since then we chose to celebrate birthday outside the house. This year we chose camping at my parents' house. His father did not mind. I think even kids are big. After all, said to live at home haunted making good fortune smoothly. Very business indeed smoothly these past few years. Thank God he's still alive. You stay here first. What's up, Jenny? What happened to you? What the heck? Damn - Mother. - You haven't slept either. What is wrong? I also want fried udon. Why aren't you asking me? Because if you haven't eaten, Mother will tell Father. I eat alone. You just have to ask Aunt to cook it? Don't know who will eat. - It's just about the udon! - Why not ask me! Shut up! Sleep there. There! - Where is Ki-jung? - Under the table. Hurry up! 1,2,3! 1,2,3! What are you doing, Da-song? Stop! He is out. Please get an umbrella, Auntie. Hey, Park Da-song! You naughty. What is he doing? Da-song! Already Night!

Not bad. - I admit that. - Yup. But if he crosses the line later, I don't know what I am will still be kind. - What's that smell? - I have no idea. Hard to explain. Smells like when rising subway. I do not know. I haven't been on the subway in a long time. People who take the subway do have unique tastes. It's like in the back seat of a car. What if Da-song returns? No problem. I could not pull my hand. Do not be like that. Counter clockwise. Delicious ... That is right. You still keep cheap panties? What? His girlfriend's underwear Yin Yang in the car. Wear it. I will be very aroused. Really? Then I want drugs. Buy me drugs! Suction. You like? Get up quickly! Hurry up. - What is wrong? - Why Da-song? Can't sleep. Then come in.

Ki-jung! Don't hold on! Hello, President Park. Do you know me? Greetings! It's too late to say that, You have the right to be accompanied by a lawyer. This man doesn't look like a cop. He laughed? Wait a minute. This doctor doesn't either looks like a doctor After a concussion surgery, this is common. He will laugh all the time. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Need I repeat? - Which one? - Miranda's warning. You have the right to remain silent. You may be accompanied by a lawyer ... Look, he is laughing instead! What I heard ... Ki-Jung lost a lot of blood. Based on witness testimony, the defendant is proven to have broken into people's homes .. Mother is considered as murder for self defense. Even if it's punished ... .. we just undergo probation. Even when I visited Ki-Jung. KIM KI-JUNG I keep laughing. Even so ... When I see the past ... I'm not laughing. Murder in an elite area very rarely happens. Especially when a bum is found killed with a knife stuck The police are having trouble finding the motive for the attack. Mr. Park was killed by Driver Kim. The one who is known to be very polite The police are still searching this fugitive named Kim. Driver Kim then goes down this stairs. Then he disappeared in this residential area The police have checked the CCTV but couldn't find it And also there were no witnesses Until now ... Driver Kim is still missing. The fact is, Mom and I still don't know where dad is The police are still trying following us Until the media already stop preaching The police surrendered. Sometimes I go up that hill. From the hill, I can see that house clearly. Even when it snows. But somehow ... I still want to see it. Lines, dots, dots ... Dots, dots, lines, lines, dots ... Lines, dots, lines, lines, dots, dots ... Dots, lines, dots, dots ... Lines, dots, dots ... Lines, dots, lines, dots ... Son ... My child. I hope you can read this letter You're a great scout, So father wrote it this way. Is your recovery going well? I think your mother is very healthy. Father's condition is also very good. Even though father wants to cry if you think of Ki-Jung Until now, I felt like a day it was a strange day Even as a dream. But no ... That day my father woke up ... where to go. This house is considered a haunted house Of course it's hard to sell. Mr. Park, I'm sorry. Before there are new residents, I'm having a hard time But there are advantages too the house was empty. Auntie. What's her name? Moon-gwang Father can bury it. Father gives a funeral that deserves it Like humans. The person who sold the house this is very smart. Deceiving people who are just came to Korea Until finally this house sold. His parents work in a foreign company. His son studies in an international school so it's rarely at home. But there are helpers who is 24 hours at home Midnight Father is risking lives just to go to the kitchen. Father just found out that the Germans don't just eat sausages and drink beer Really lucky. Down here it's all blurry. Finally, today father can write a letter for you. Then send it at night like this I think one day you'll see it later. Greetings. - Is that you, Ki-woo? - Yup. Father ... Today I made a plan. The most basic plan. I want to work. Have lots of money. College and then work. Marriage is also important The point is I want to have lots of money Inside is very wide.
