Okay, really nice. Move in a little closer... Yeah, there you go. Um, and put your head into his-- there we go. Love it. There. Big eyes. Really good. There we go. Gotta say, I love watching you work, Gina. Thanks for the call, Lee. Yeah, well, you got a good eye. My money? Ouch. Straight to business, huh? What's this? That's half of my heart... half the money. Levon.... You get paid the rest of the money when I get the finished edits, okay? Now you get paid like a regular vendor. See? Dating your producer did have its perks. Mm. Really messed that one up, didn't you? Hey. I'm being responsible. Yeah, looks like you're real responsible with that new car over there. What? That's a lease, okay? I can afford that. Whatever. You'll get your edits tomorrow night. What about tonight? I can't. I'm busy tonight. What are you doing? You got a date? I'm just taking pictures of my mom's house. - You finally selling it? - No. Subletting. Guesthouse. What, that-- that shack in the back? I stayed there in college. It was fine, short-term. Plus, I need the money. You have got to get a place in town. You don't need all that space out there. Plus, it would be better for your business. No. That's not an option. Can't do it. Family home. Besides, you screwed up our credit when we were together, so, either I sublet it or I work at a restaurant again. Well, we had some good times in that guest house. Maybe I should rent it. I'll see you tomorrow at six. Thanks for helping me out with this today, Rachel. Not a problem, girl. Wow... This place brings back memories. Yep. Well... shall we? Let's do it. So, you're asking for 800. That seems like a lot. It's what the market commands. Okay. I just need to log in from the desktop, upload the photos, and then we're ready to go public. Ooh! Looks nice. I feel like I'm selling my soul. This covers almost half your mortgage payment. Just think of it like your mom's final gift to you. Hello... Are you spying on me? Why? Because I think I just found someone. A pilot. So, is he hot? Takes care of himself. He's divorced with a daughter who's seven. Served in the military with honors. Currently a pilot for a private aviation firm, moving from city to city. He likes to cook, exercise, and tend to his gardening hobbies, and he's a photo/video enthusiast. Okay, so you have, like, a genie and a lamp, or... He's got a lot of five-star ratings and positive reviews. One family wished he'd stayed forever. Message him. Move him in. 'Kay. "Hi, Mark. Are you in town? Why don't you come by at six p.m.?" Sent. I'm nervous. Don't be. This is gonna be great. Well, you're not the one who's letting some stranger into her house. Into your guest suite, far in the back of your property. I gotta go. I gotta get to work. I believe in you. Okay, which one of you is shorting out? Is it you? No. Is it you? No. Then it's got to be you. Yeah, it was you. Gina? - I'm sorry. - Oh... Mark? Yeah. Okay. Side door. Great. Hi... officially. Nice to meet you. Yeah, sorry, I went to the front and, uh, saw the lights go off, so I tried to ring the doorbell. Oh, I blew a fuse, um, so the power was out. Oh. Yeah, okay. Um, anyway, I didn't mean to scare you. Oh, no, no, no. It's okay. So, um, you've found me on my back patio. And the shared laundry is back through the kitchen, in, um, in the window where you saw me. Perfect. - Let me show you the guesthouse. - Great. It's, uh, beautiful back here. Thanks. It was my mom's, through her family. Oh, yeah, you can tell. It has a real family touch. Feels grounded and cared for. So, did you just fly in? I did. Yes, ma'am. Uh, Atlanta. Short trip, really, as most of them are, for me. You're a photographer, right? I am. Yeah, your profile mentioned that. I think it's really inspiring to see somebody pursuing their passions like that-- assuming it is your passion? It is. This is the suite. Okay, it's, uh.... small. Yeah. Well, you also have access to the shower and the bathroom and the yard. Yeah, actually, uh, I noticed your flowerbeds out there, they could use a little love. Oh. I'm sort of a green thumb. Did you take this? Yeah. Um, I don't have patience for a lot of things, but for that moment like that, I do. It's beautiful. You obviously have great taste. Thanks. Design and photography are my passions. I'm trying to get more into portraiture, but it doesn't really pay, so. This is adorable. Look at this. Something good? Ah, it's my daughter. She turned seven last week, and she has fallen in love with drawing. Oh, adorable. What's her name? Alison. Does she ever go flying with you? No, not really. Um, the trips are too short, so. But she might come out here later this summer for a little father/daughter time. Jessica, my ex, has this important event, and I kind of want to help her out, so. - That's awesome. - Yeah. Well, hopefully, I get to meet her. Oh! The deep freeze. I'm sorry, that's just for my extra film stock. You still use film stock? That's impressive. Yeah, there's nothing like it. Well, look, I don't know how many other candidates you're considering, but I'd love to put down a deposit. Give you time to think about it. I've thought about it. Welcome aboard. - Yeah? - Yeah. Great! I mean, the location to the airport is perfect, so. I'm glad it works out. Um, let me pay you. Right! Sorry, I'm new at this. And... there. Wow, that was so fast. I know, right? Well, I guess I'm now technically trespassing in your space. Hey, mi casa, su casa. Nice. Your keys. Ah. The gold is for the front door, silver is for the shared laundry. Okay. Well, thank you. And, uh, well, maybe one of these days, when you're not so busy, I can check out that studio of yours. Of course. Yeah? I'm such a geek for that stuff, so. Awesome. Well, welcome to the neighborhood, neighbor. Thanks for having me. I'll see you around. Yeah. God. Good morning. I hope you're hungry. Ta-dah. Uh, Mark, what the... My favorite dish that I picked up on my travels-- the Irish breakfast. Now, this is a classic, but I've added just a little a twist. Dill. Try that, please. - Mm! - How good is that? Please, take a seat. Okay, I guess. So, is this, like, normal for you? Waking up this early and making all this food? Um, yeah, pretty much. I went for a run. Did some laundry. Got hungry, figured you would get hungry, too, so... - Thank you. - Yeah. It's very inspiring. I wish I could wake up this early. You're more of a night owl? Yeah, as us artist types generally are. So, you're working from home today, or...? Yeah, I have a client coming to approve a shoot. And then I have to do my own stuff. If you want to still see the studio... Yeah, definitely. Of course. Thank you. What? Would you model? For me. Like, now? I'm sorry. I always do that. I have this camera thing that I'm trying to fix, and it would be a lot easier if I have a subject. But only if you're interested. Yes. I would be happy to model for you. Would you sign a release? And I can't pay you, but I can give you snacks and a lot of bad jokes. You know what? That's actually my going rate. Perfect. Okay. Why did the turkey cross the road? Now, come on. That one is way too easy. Um, to prove he wasn't a chicken. So this is what you do, huh? Uh, basically. These your pictures? Yeah. What are they doing here? They should be out there. I mean, they would sell on the market, 100 %. Those are for my portfolio. I'm using them to get an agency. Agencies, like? Liebs, Simms... all the big ones. Some of the medium ones. I actually have all the emails composed. I just have to send them out. So what's stopping you? I just want to be ready. Mm. Long time ago, when I wasn't as, um... athletic as I am now, I used to tell my army buddy that I wanted to wait go to the gym until I was in better shape, so that I could look and feel good when I got there. And I was just waiting to be ready. Then I took that same attitude into Afghanistan. Waiting to be ready. I tell you, there's nothing like whizzing bullets flying over your head to make you realize that the moment is... now. It's life and death, in a choice... and if we're not ready, we're never ready. You're right. They're just emails, not bullets. There you go. And I'm rejecting myself... before I'm even letting anyone else reject me. Now you're talking. Oh, my god. I just cold-emailed eight of the biggest agencies in the country. How's that feel? Amazing! Thank you. All you. No, you really got to me there. Have you ever thought about becoming a life coach? I've, uh, I've read enough of it. Here's someone who's read none of it. My ex-boyfriend. Sorry. Should I leave? No, no, no. Stay. Hi, Levon. Ho! "Levon"? Now I know I'm in trouble. I have someone here. What do you want? I was just calling to see how the edits are coming. They look great. You're gonna love them. So, uh, I'll see you tonight? You want to get some dinner? No, Levon, I don't want to. Are you gonna bring the other half? Yeah. Yeah, I'll bring the rest of your money. All right. I will see you later. Sorry about that. No. It's, uh... it's great that you guys still talk. Yeah, I don't know if we communicate as well as you and your ex seem to. No? No. Well, I got to get back to work, but this is my studio. It's amazing. Thank you for showing me. And you've obviously got something very special here, which I'm sure you know. Thank you. That's sweet. Don't let people like your ex get to you. I mean, you sent those emails, and someone's going to bite. Very soon. Forget Leron. "Levon." Already forgotten. Knock-knock. Guess who's here. Champagne? Yeah, well... we always used to throw a little party after a big shoot, right? I think you're gonna really like the photos. Oh, I don't doubt it. That's why we're celebrating. To the dream team. Okay, I'm gonna show you the edits now. Great. These are brilliant. Honestly, Gina, they're amazing. You've gotta come back and work with me. Levon, don't. Why not? Come on. I know I can't change what I did, but I promise you, it'll never happen again. Levon, stop! - Listen. - No! We are gonna do this, you're gonna pay me, and we're gonna go on with our lives. Wow, Is that all I am to you now? A paycheck? You got that Square thing? Are you serious? What? You know I don't take card. I asked you for cash. All my cash got swallowed up, okay? I'm offering to pay you. It just has to be on a credit card. Idiot. Are you ser-- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you-- What are you doing, Gina? No cash, no photos. Gina, don't do this. You owe me $1,200. That is not easy to come by. I offered to pay you, but it has to be credit! What do you want? Well, I am holding this collateral. - You are not holding that. - Stop. - The clients need these photos-- - Levon, no. Right now. Give it to me! Right now! - No! - Hey. Buddy. Who's this? Why don't you leave her alone? Levon! Levon! - Ah! - That was a close one. Get off me, man. Get off of me! Who the hell is this? This is my tenant, Mark. Oh, yeah? Yeah. You try hitting me again, it's not gonna work out so well. You get it? And now you're gonna leave. I want my photos. I just want what I'm owed, Lee. So that's the ex. Yeah. I'd like to say that he has a good side, but I don't know. Hey, you know what? It takes a long time to see who people really are. I'm gonna call it a night. I've had a long day and I'm exhausted. Yeah, of course. You know, get some rest. Anything I can get you? Just Levon out of my life? - Okay. - I'm kidding. Thanks for being there. Yeah. You're gonna be okay. Uh, yeah... I, uh, I get into things. I just... I can honestly say that I've never met a person quite like you. Well, I will take that as a compliment. I just figured, you know, the weather's getting perfect, and nothing says "change is here" like fresh flowers ushering in a new season, so. Poetic. Think I stole it from a book or something. Ah, I gotta fly. Off to rule the world? Uh, bank meeting. When my mom passed, the house was supposed to foreclose if I didn't take it on, so I'm gonna talk to the bank manager, see if he can help me out, hence the... The renting out your space to a stranger? I get it. Listen, um, I wanted to ask you, are you-- you all right after last night? Honestly, that's Levon on a good day. Ugh. Thanks again for the flowers. Really awesome to see. Yeah, yeah, you're welcome. Good luck. Thanks. Yes, photojournalism. I wasn't approved for a loan before, but I'm hoping, with a new tenant and a source of income, you can reassess. Well, let's see what the numbers tell us. Okay. Well, your additional income does change things. Yeah? You actually do qualify for our small business package. Wow, that's great. ...Which entitles you to our low-interest rate. Wow, that is amazing. Thank you so much. My pleasure. Gina! Gina? Come on. Screw it. I'm taking them all. Oh, god. I'm sorry, Levon, but you're nothing but trouble-- I'm gonna kill you, man! ...Trouble for me. Ah! Get away from me! Ahh! ...Trouble for Gina. ...Trouble for yourself. Get away from me, man! Ahh! Oh! Ahh... Oh! No! Levon... I cannot believe you. "Robert Simms Agency"? Hello. This is Gina Larson. Miss Larson, hi. I'm calling on behalf of Robert Simms. He'd like to schedule an appointment with you. Would you be available Friday, 11 a.m., Chez Bijou Lounge? Um, yes, Friday at 11 works. Thank you very much. Wonderful. We'll see you then. Thanks. Bye. Ho! Hey! Hey. Where are you? I was just, uh... just about to go for a run. What's up? You must be some kinda magic or something. Why? Well, first of all, I got the loan. Wow! That's, uh, that's amazing. But that's not it. I also heard back from one of the top agencies I applied to. Hey-hey! Congratulations. I honestly can't believe it. I'm really happy for you. Well, thanks again for pushing me to send those emails. I honestly owe you, big-time. Yeah, well, uh... I don't know, maybe a little celebratory dinner tonight? I can whip you up one of my world-famous dishes of the seven seas. Ugh, I would love to, but I gotta prep for this big meeting in the morning. Totally understood. Maybe another time? I will hold you to that. And, uh... Congratulations again. I'm really happy for you. I wanted to tell you first. Let's get this cleaned up. Ooh! I'm gonna have to get cleaned up. Dirty boy. Oh. Uh, and I'm gonna need to borrow your car. I hope that's okay. Really? Douchebag. Hey! Hey. You okay? Levon. Did something happen? ...dammit. What? He took the photos and he didn't leave the money. Who? Levon. Let's see what the camera says. Camera? Yeah, I have a motion sensor to protect the equipment. Wow. You got him. Moron. So do you have these cameras all over the house? - 'Cause you definitely should. - No. There's nothing valuable in the house. Who're you calling? Levon. Really? Are you sure it's a-- a good idea to phone him right now? No, don't worry. He never answers the phone when he's in trouble. Jerk. I'm sorry you're seeing this. I promise this isn't gonna happen all the time. No. No, no, no. Don't worry about me. It's just guys like this really get to me, you know? All right. I'm gonna go get my cozies on and do some work. Don't judge me. No judgment here. Uh, hey, thanks again for helping with Levon. Yeah, of course. Have a good night. Sleep tight. Art is, to each individual... something different. It could be a math equation. People can find that interesting and beautiful in its own right. You know, you can't intellectualize the process. It's something you see... Hey! Hey. I bring treats. Thank you. You're welcome. Hope I didn't interrupt you. No. He's a... fascinating guy. You know Robert Simms? Just what I've read, here and there. I went to high school with him. You did? Well, he's a lot older than me, but we did go to the same high school. Mm. Small world. Mm-hmm. So he did okay for himself. Yeah. And, tomorrow, I am having lunch with him thanks to you. - You are? - Mm-hmm. I owe you, big-time. How about I take you for dinner tomorrow night? Sure. Yeah, I'd love to. Okay. Enjoy. Thanks. Robert Simms. Who are you? "Positions available..." Hair and makeup... Modeling. Hey, let me out! Hey! Hello, Robert. Hello, Mr. Simms. "They call me Mr. Simms." Morning, sunshine. Let's go on a little field trip. I'm the value. Gina. Hi! Such a pleasure. Oh, the pleasure is mine. Honestly. - Come. - Okay. Okay, so... I just got to get it out there. I also went to Hillside High. Ha! Really? You did? Yeah, class of '07. Amazing. So, Alma Award winner. Jemeson finalist. Truman Larson custodian. I mean, that is an impressive list you have. Thank you. And then, after a real dynamic start, you just stopped. What happened? Well, my mom got sick. Mm. I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you. I wanted to be there to spend more time with her, so I moved back from New York, to come home. Ah, hence the shift in your work. I noticed it in your portfolio. My mom loved the birds... Uh-huh? So we spend a lot of time outside in nature, taking photos, and then, I guess, just losing someone teaches you what you want in life, what you want to be. What you don't want to be. Sometimes, the "don'ts" are easier to recognize than the "do's." Yes. Um, unfortunately, I agree with that. That was another reason I took time off. Um... I had a bad break-up. Yeah, I heard a little bit about that. You were with Levon Staret. Is that right? Yes. Yeah, he came knocking on our door a few times. Not our style. I'm surprised that the two of you actually got together. My mom said that he was my shadow. Her and I spent a lot of time working that one out. Looks like you got over it. Yeah. To me, life experiences are never wasted on the artist. You take all your experiences-- the good, the bad-- and you throw them into your art, so that people like me can feel something. And that's what your work does to me, Gina, it makes me feel something, it evokes emotion. Thank you. That, uh, that piece you wrote about your pitch, the "windows are the soul..." That was outstanding. Where'd you come up with that? I guess I just saw the windows as layers, layers of our life... and our soul, and... - Mm-hmm. - All that abstract stuff. Spoken like a true artist. I want you to join our team, Gina. I feel a real strong connection with your work, and I think we can do some excellent work together. Thank you. I'm sorry, I'm stunned. You're ready. What do you say? Yes. Yes, yes. - Yes? - Yes, yes! Yes. To "yes." So if my art department can get those frames built this weekend, how do you feel about a Monday shoot? I feel ecstatic about it. Excellent. You know what I like about you? You know your worth, which is important, but you don't know how good you really are... which is where I come in. I'll see you Monday. See you Monday. Yes. Oh, hey. Hey. What are you doing here? Robert Simms is gonna rep me and, starting Monday, I have a job! I'm not really gonna order anything. It's fine. I am so thrilled for you. It's been such a whirlwind. So how's the new tenant working out? He's really sweet, and I saw him planting flowers in my front yard this morning. Okay, I need to meet this guy. Double date for your birthday with Tom and I? Do not mention my birthday. Rachel? Let's go. Gotta go. Get me water. Oh, my gosh. Hey. This is so sweet. Yeah, you know, I just thought we'd celebrate your meeting, so-- Oh! Hey. What's, uh... what-- All it took was you having just a little bit of belief in me. You got the job? He liked what he saw? - He loved it. - Ohh! That's fantastic. Well, it's worth celebrating. Yes! Yes. Yes. And I am the value. You are the value! So, listen, I actually went out and got my first stills camera today. Did you? Yeah, you inspired me. So I was thinking, maybe, after we have a little bit of this, and a little bit of this, you could give me a little tutorial? Would you kill me if I said, let's have a nice dinner tonight, tomorrow we can do a proper hang-out, I can show you the camera, and maybe the Canopy? The Canopy? Mm. You'll see. Well... okay. Well... here it is. The Canopy. Wow! Very impressive. Kind of neat. Yeah. Okay, wait, wait. ...So slow. Not at all. Oh, what's that? Oh, we gotta go. - Wanna check it out? - Yeah. ♪ I can't help myself from falling... ♪ ♪ I'm in trouble this time ♪ ♪ 'Cause I can't get close enough ♪ ♪ You've got me burning up ♪ ♪ I can't get close enough ♪ ♪ To you ♪ Oh, my god. What? Levon. Homicide. What? I just saw. This is so freaky. Are you okay? I don't know. I don't understand. Well, I'm coming over. Okay. I'll see you soon. You all right? What happened? I need to call the police. Hi there. I need Homicide. Levon Staret. Yeah, I don't know, he just tried to hit me, then he took off. And why didn't you report this? The break-in? What difference would it have made, one more violation? He's the reason that I got the cameras in the first place. What happened? Why did his car explode? Nobody has told me anything. Well, there's no body, so he's missing. What? He's missing? As far as forensics can tell, yeah. He's missing. Did he ever talk about leaving town, anything like that? Yeah, Levon was always leaving town. That was the story of our relationship. If you think of anything else, give me a call. Okay. You smell that? That's a "Night Sky" petunia. I know a thing or two. Hi. Uh, Rachel? Mark? Yes. So good to meet you finally. How is she? Uh, you know, she's hit pretty hard, but she's doing all right. You okay? My god. Rachel, can I, um, can I get you some tea? Sure. Thanks. So what did the cops say? They can't find his body. What? And somehow, it's suspicious that I didn't report the break-in. You never told me he broke in. I guess everything just happened so fast. Hey, here you are. That's my laundry. He's great. So what did Levon take? Some stupid little USB with his photos on it. A USB key? USB key... Ahem. Oh, geez! Guess you, uh... you wanna do your laundry? Yep. You're done, right? Yeah. Yeah. Just missing a sock. Always seems to happen. You know you're not fooling me? Excuse me? Missing sock? I think we all know that missing socks turn into extra Tupperware lids. It makes some sense, huh? That's... Yeah. That's a good one. Um... All yours. So, movie and popcorn in bed? Maybe a short one. I have my first day with Robert tomorrow. Right. Well, um... Goodnight, ladies. You mean you don't want to join movie night? We could do an action-adventure romcom. That's a very enticing offer, but I actually have a very exciting flight update manual to read, so. Oh. Yep. Text me if you need anything, okay? Thanks. I will. Goodnight, Rachel. Goodnight. 'Kay, what just happened? He kissed me goodnight? Wow. That's what I'm competing with. You've got the gig. Relax. Yeah. You're right. What was it like? Meeting him? Robert? "Roberto." He was nice. Sincere. How'd he look? Handsome and sophisticated. You tell him you had a crush on him since, like, forever ago? Of course not. And it wasn't a crush, it was, like, admiration. Right. Sure. It's true! We were in the same school and had the same classes. He was living a life I wanted to live. I remember you being obsessed with him. And he was seriously hot. I mean, he still is. Guy's like John Mayer. Doesn't age at all. It's got to be about the photos. Always about the photos. Prince Robert and the fairy tale can wait another day. Ah-hah! So you admit, there's a fairytale. Stop it. Why? Because of Mark? Think he'll get jealous of our Prince and his Princess? Did you guys do more than just...? You did not! No...! I am the worst landlord. I'm gonna go to landlord hell. Well, how was Mr. Top Gun Pilot? I was celebrating and we were drunk. I moved too fast. He signed for three months. So, you fooled around, it was probably good for you, but let it go. He's not the prize. Robert is. Yeah, and if things go well with Robert, then I won't even have to rent out my guest suite. Exactly. If anything, as good as Mark is, you've got a prince of an opportunity in front of you, and you need to focus on it and Robert. And maybe there'll even be a fairy-tale ending! Ohh. Okay, well, I gotta go. You look amazing. Feminine, strong... ready for action. It's Mark. Right on cue. What's loverboy say? Stop calling him that. He's just wishing me good luck. He has a flight today. Mm. All right. I'm gonna go. Break a leg! Or... a lens. Not a lens. Definitely not lens. I have value. I am me. Hi, everyone. I'm Gina. I have value. I am me. You got this. Just picture him in his underwear. Don't do that. I am the value. Yes. Gina. Robert. Or I should say "Mr. Simms." No. Robert's fine. Oh, listen, I wanted to say I'm so how sorry to hear about Levon. Oh... thank you. It's awful. He was a bit of a pain to deal with, but this is horrible. Yeah, Levon always knew how to find trouble. Well, if there's anything I can do, just, please, let me know. Thank you. - Shall we? - Yes. All right. We've got a whole set-up for you inside. We've got a team of technicians that... Let me get the door. ...Technicians that are just so excited to meet you. Good morning, good morning, good morning! Hello, everyone. Well, not only is she extremely talented, but she's also incredibly nice and we are so lucky to have her. Welcome your new director, Gina Larson. Thank you, Robert. Thanks, guys. I'm honestly so excited to be here and work with all of you. Let's just go out there and have fun. And remember, you are the value, so be the value. - I like that! - Yeah. All right. Back to work. I like this. Okay. And you are trying to convince her that she still loves you, but she doesn't want to even look at you. There you go. Okay. Two p.m. That's right. Thank you. Bye-bye. - Hi! - Hi. My name is Roger Marks. Ever since I was a kid, I have dreamed of starting my modeling career here at Simms. I'm willing to do whatever it takes. Who do I talk to? Both of you guys, look away. Okay, really nice, you guys. Get a little closer? Yeah. You're her Spanish lover. All right. Now... Great. Really nice. Yeah. Just like that. You know, this is wonderful. You'd be surprised at how many people actually start quite late. I model, myself. Oh, yeah? That's so great to hear. How long have you been Mr. Simms' personal assistant? Uh, almost four years now. Best years ever. I can only imagine. Okay, one more. Wait for me. There you go. All right. Okay, guys, that's good. Let's take a break. Thank you. You're making me look good, Gina. - Really? - Oh, yeah. Walk with me. Now, I don't know if you noticed who... Mr. Simms weaves his wonders around the corner and the cafeteria-- Uh, Patrick, sorry to interrupt you. Uh, restroom. Where can I find it? Oh, yeah, it's around the corner. I'll meet you in the cafeteria. It's straight ahead. You can't miss it. Perfect. Won't be a moment. Thanks. Well, you better get used to it. These guys spare no expense. I just still can't believe that I'm even given this opportunity. Listen, I'm, uh... I'm hosting a little cocktail party/art show tomorrow night for some clients, and, uh, I want you to come, as my special guest. Oh, I'm sorry, I can't. Why not? Oh, tomorrow's my birthday. Your birthday? - Mm-hmm. - Well, that changes everything. You have to come. We'll have it in your honor. Oh, I really can't. Why? You got some big plans? Yeah, my best friend and her boyfriend... Bring 'em. The more the merrier. - Yeah? - For sure! She is a really big fan of yours. Hmm. Even better. I just think it's, um... I really want to celebrate your existence. Okay, yes. - Okay? - Yes. Okay, good. So, welcome to your new life. Now... I think we better get back to work, huh? Yeah. All right. Robert is a mentor. He sees me as an artist. He sees me for me. I cannot tell you how good that feels. Even more reason it's better to go sans Mark. It should be about you and your, ahem, "mentorship." Okay. I'm gonna get some sleep. Sleep tight. Sweet dreams of your new year and Prince Roberto. Okay. Goodnight, Rachel. This is 30. Hope you like it. Mark. I didn't know that you'd be back. Oh, yeah. Just a quick flight. In and out of Denver. Anyways... happy birthday. May I? Of course. It's beautiful. You're beautiful. Oh. Mm! So. Any plans tonight? Tonight? Yeah. For your birthday? Um... Actually, now that you're back... Robert Simms invited Rachel, Tom, and me, and you... if you're interested, to dinner. Really? He invited me? Of course. I talk about you all the time. Oh. Never hung out with all the talented people before. Stop it. You're talented. You have a great story. They'll love you. Be ready for 7:30? That sounds really great. I'm looking forward to meeting him. Robert. Everything okay? I got followed last night. - What? - Yeah. They stopped outside the house when I got there. By who? Do you know? I have no idea. Then I was awakened in the middle of the night by a sound in the backyard. I went out there-- nothing. Then, at 3:40 a.m., I start getting these texts, from a number I don't recognize. "Hello, old friend. "I've been watching you. Stay away from Gina." What? That's Levon's number. Your Levon? Robert, Levon is texting you, but he's been missing for days. How long has this been going on for? Has he texted you before? No. Never. I mean, I didn't even know who it was. I need to send this to Detectives. Is it okay if I screenshot this and send it to myself? Please, yeah. Thanks. Um, also, about tonight. You're still coming, right? Yes, of course. I was just hoping I could invite my new tenant, Mark? Your tenant? He lives in my guest suite. He's a really nice guy. Served in Afghanistan, he's a pilot, and a photography enthusiast. I just don't really know what to do with him. Yeah, sure, bring him. Any friend of yours is a friend of mine. Thanks. Detective Brown. Detective Brown, this is Gina Larson. What can I do for you this morning, Miss Larson? Levon texted my boss last night. Really? I just sent you the screenshots. He also said that someone or something was in his backyard. All right, we'll look into it. Deputy Michaels has some updates on Levon. Deputy? Hi, Miss Larson. The ad agency that hired Mr. Staret never received that purple USB drive you mentioned. Are you serious? Last time the agency heard from Levon was a few hours before your security camera caught him stealing the drive. There's something seriously wrong about this. Oh, my god, is that... No. Never mind. What if we run into someone, like, famous? Rach, keep it together, okay? I just want to get this over with as soon as possible. I'm ready to boogie. Yeah. You got it. You weren't kidding. He hasn't aged a day. Guess that's what having group sex with models does for you. Rachel. I'm gonna get some drinks. Who wants? - Ooh, white wine? - Yes, me too, please. You want to come with? - Um-- - I'll help. Great. He was doing that in the car earlier, too. What? Glaring at you. Yeah, you know, he's been a little funny lately, but he's a pilot, he flies, they get tired. I don't know, I think that's it. Gina. Robert. Hi. Hello, ladies. Robert Simms, this is Rachel Vine, my oldest friend. Well, hi. A pleasure to meet you. I also went to Hillside High. It's a regular reunion here. She used to stalk your grad picture in the hallways-- and I mean stalk. I think that's enough breaking the ice. Do you not have anything better to say? Like maybe somewhere to go? Sorry I missed the punchline. Rachel here was just, uh, saying how Gina here used to crush on me in high school. If only you were a student then. If only. Robert Simms, this is Mark James. Oh! The war vet? Thank you for your service. Where were you stationed? Fifth division, south of Baghdad. Ah, yeah, I lost a nephew to that unnecessary war. A real shame. Hi. I'm Tom. - Tom! Nice to meet you. - Same. You too. Are we ready to celebrate the birthday girl? Yes! I wasn't sure what to get someone I'm just starting to get to know, so I thought maybe the most meaningful gift would be to show you, through your eyes, just how amazing I think you really are. Would you? Okay. Your first portrait at RSCA! Not only in our signature Simms Silver Series frame, but you're looking at next month's cover photo. Oh, my gosh! Thank you so much! This is amazing! You really possess the most incredible eye, Gina. It's really a gift that you have. Not only is it a pleasure, it is absolutely a delight to have this on the cover. Thank you so much. Thank you. Now, I have to go and take care of some business. Everybody, just continue to have some fun. Drink, eat. Everybody, just continue Happy birthday, Gina! [Ove! Let's dance! Restroom. I'll be right back. Come on, you can't leave me hanging. You gotta come back. I promise. Ah, bonjour. Bonjour, Francois. How are you? What time is it in Paris right now? Hello? Francois? Hey. Whoo! Savior! Sorry, guys, got tied up there. Cheers! Patrick! Great party. Uh, we're Robert's guests. This is Gina, Rachel, Tom. I like your bow-tie. What are they doing here? Sorry. Hi there. Can I assist you folks with anything? Robert Simms. Where can we find him? He's around here somewhere. Fancy seeing you here. We got an anonymous tip. Some video footage of some suspicious activity in a backyard. Someone digging a grave. Robert Simms. I don't understand. We went to the site where he was digging. We found Levon's body. What? We also found Mr. Simms' coat hidden in his backyard bushes. We'll need some time to confirm the DNA, but the bloodstains are likely Levon's. Can't find him, but we can check his office upstairs. - Let's do that. - Yeah. "I can't do this anymore. The guilt is too much. Please forgive me, Levon." Someone call the coroner. Oh, my god. Come on, we'll take you home. Hey... Hey. I heard you come home. Are you all right? Are you going somewhere? Yeah, I gotta go to Phoenix. I just got the call Just a last-second run. Look, are you all right? Those officers wouldn't tell us anything, except that they were gonna make some sort of an arrest or something. It was Robert. And they were gonna go arrest him. He took his own life. Oh, my god. It was Robert the whole time. Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. He killed Levon and he buried him in his backyard. Somebody caught the whole thing on some video camera or something. So, what? They knew each other? Oh, what happened? Are you okay? Yeah, no, I was just helping out with some cargo yesterday. I'm so sorry, but I have to go. Oh... It's fine. Are you gonna be all right? Fly safely. It looks really pretty on you. Okay. Hello? What's going on? This is all so crazy! You have no idea. What? You've reached Detective Brown. Leave a message and I'll be sure to return your call. What? Oh, no... I really wish you had asked before entering my suite. Mark... I just had to get something out of my freezer. Really? So you went in my briefcase and you took my SD card? Mark... I don't-- I don't even know anything, I swear. You didn't see the video? 'Cause it sure looked like you did. Which is too bad for you. Mark, wait! Gina. Gina. Obviously, you're still out here. Why don't you just come out, and we'll have a little chat? What you probably don't realize is that I'm on your side, okay? I'm just trying to give you a perfect life! A perfect life for you... A perfect life for us! I'm getting zero-- What's the difference between a blonde and a shopping cart? A shopping cart has a mind of its own. Ouch! Well, that's sexist. You know what, you're right. Your left side is much stronger. I'm kidding! You're beautiful. What? What? Water... please. Chin up. You know, Gina. You and I... are making beautiful art together. Why do you think I let you live longer than the others? Did you kill them? Did you kill Levon and Robert? I was protecting you, Gina! No... No, Robert was just my friend. He was kissing you! He was my friend. It's Detective Brown. Seems a little late for a phone call, doesn't it? She's gonna be suspicious if I don't answer. I am going to put this on speakerphone, and if you say anything... I swear to God... Hello, Detective? Miss Larson, sorry to wake you, but it's urgent and it couldn't wait. It's fine, I was actually already awake. Forensics has ruled out a suicide for Mr. Simms. They discovered clear evidence of foul play. They also found some additional DNA evidence, from the traces of blood on Levon's keys. Does the name James M. Brewer sound familiar? No. He goes by many aliases, one of which, unfortunately, is the name of man staying with you now. James Brewer is extremely dangerous, Miss Larson. We want you to get out of the house and come to the station. Yes. I can do that. Stay safe, Miss Larson. We'll see you shortly. You're a good actor. Too bad you're not gonna make it. Please don't do this. James. I'm on your side. I wouldn't even be working at the Simms Agency if it weren't for you. I'm sorry, Gina. You know too much now. We all have skeletons in our closet. I do, too. Let's get through them together. We can sell the house. We can travel around the world and do photography together. We could have a life together. I always thought if I showed someone my true self, that I'd be rejected. You don't need to hide anything from me. I accept you. Take another picture. Perp's had active scams going in Denver, Atlanta, Ohio. He was serious shapeshifter. Folks don't even know how he got out. Gina! Honey. I'm okay. I can't believe he tried to bury you in the garden. Yeah, apparently, that's his thing. Across 12 state lines. All with necklaces, hearts, names, letters... You're lucky you got out alive. Like that? Yeah, that's great. Can we see that ring a little more, please? - Ooh. - There you go! It looks great. I'm so happy for you guys. Only took him six years. Some good things are worth waiting for. Speaking of things worth waiting for... Oh! Right. Wow. That looks amazing. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Still kind of weird having it out there, though. But he signed a release and it pays for the house. Yeah, you're right. And people need to know creeps like him exist. Okay, why don't you guys go up the stairs and I'll get a shot of you at the water? This is gonna be you one day. You know, I think I'm good for now. Attagirl. All right. Show me the love that I know is there. Good. All right, give me a nice kiss.
