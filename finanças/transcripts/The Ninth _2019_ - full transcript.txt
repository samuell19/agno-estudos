THE CINEMA FOUNDATION OF RUSSIA NON-STOP PRODUCTION WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE CINEMA FOUNDATION OF RUSSIA ALEXANDER RODNYANSKY SERGEY MELKUMOV PRESENT A FILM BY NIKOLAY KHOMERIKI THE NINTH Here we are, Olivia. We've found this damn city at last. The book has to be somewhere here. Here. James, this is crazy. We've come too far to turn back at the last moment. We will go all the way this time and we will get our daughter back. I have a bad feeling, no book can bring our daughter back. I'm afraid for you. Come on. It's nothing but a mortal fear of the inexplicable. You have nothing to fear with me. Smells like death. We were not mistaken, we don't have time to argue. Follow me. That's it. Sir, it's time for me to return. Could you pay? James, why? He saw too much. You must not be afraid, my dear Olivia, you must lie on this stone. We will not bow to his will. We will ask another master to help us. We'll surely get back our daughter. James, please stop, it won't help. You know this book opens the way to darkness. The world needs darkness. Now the darkness will return to us what death has taken. What? Your death, my dear will give life, an eternal life. I don't want... Please don't be afraid, Olivia. The darkness can resurrect me, the darkness is almighty. The book is the whip. Lets you get what you need. You will be forever tormented. You could save me, but you did not. I'm sorry. The door was open. You seem troubled. I had a dream about the book again, like in a penny dreadful. You are insufferable, doctor, please stop looking at me. Is this book really so important? You can bring back the dead without it. I cannot bring back the dead, only memories of them. When you summon the dead, they do not come alone. They bring hell with them and hell stays. You deal with dreadful powers, Miss Reed. I sincerely hope the disappearance of my book is purely accidental, it will be a disaster, if someone with knowledge acquires it. What if it has already begun? We would have noticed. Mister, mister! Can you spare a coin? For a crust of bread. My mother died, sir. Please. Are you nuts?! Twenty kopecks...! The dead girl was beautiful... and her tongue was cut out. Lips stitched together. Neatly, according to Pavlusha the Deadman. By a sober hand. Seems the devil's at play. I hear they get branded. For a crust of bread. My mom died. Well, it's obvious. It's the Vladimirskiy gang out to play. What do you want with them? Her tongue was cut out. Mouth sewn shut. She talked too much. Please, mister. - A coin. For... - Listen, kid! You get nothing for whining. - Beg sincerely. - Let the lad go. Murderer. Police! - Go, go. - Scram! Must you interfere, Ganin? There's a fourth one, sir. Was she sewn up? Stomach ripped open like a pheasant for stuffing. That's some comparison. I skipped lunch. You shouldn't have come here alone, sir. With your position and skills... you shouldn't do operative work. Get stabbed to death, and I'll have a new boss to deal with. The operative workers were sent out to catch anarchists. Get some delicious sauerkraut! And we have four victims already. You used paste as glue, right? Resin would have worked better. Next time, you can glue it on. And you shouldn't pity homeless kids. Or anyone at all. - What happened? - What's going on? We are being punished for our sins. My God, how can this be? - Afternoon, sir. - Was someone killed? Branded while still alive. Same as the others. And fairly recently, too. The bastard only attacks the pretty ones. May I examine her more closely? Please. What was used to make the cut? The blade was wide and very sharp. Perhaps... a meat cleaver. No trace of inflammation - she died almost instantly. What's in there? What... barbarism. The heart is missing. It was taken out after her death. By someone inexperienced. Rinse this, my dear fellow. Hard-boiled. I need someone who can explain what this is. It's an egg, sir. A chicken egg most likely. And the drawing... We'll find an expert. How very curious. I've examined many things - Japanese antiques, cuneiform potsherds, - MISS OLIVIA REED. - Even Kabbalistic curses. But never... an egg brought by criminal investigators. Where did you get it? Doesn't matter. As you wish. This is a pentagram. The image itself is not a code, but it does have meaning. Pentagrams are not evil. They serve as protection against evil. As magic symbols. Are you a magician? I'm just... an amateur. A reader. An occultist of sorts. But I have no gift. Why is that same symbol here, then? SPIRITUAL EVENING I don't remember. It's a pretty trivial symbol, really. I would like to attend this show. Please, be my guest. Is this some Inquisition-era device? For ancient torture? No. That's... a very modern piece of equipment. After all, I'm... a fan of English fashions. And a favorite English pastime is... sport. Entertainment for your muscles. Essential... for those who work in their study. Could we have seats with a good view of the audience? Seeing the spirits will be exciting no matter where you sit. I'm not interested in spirits. I want to see the living. God, it's like a fairytale! It looks so real! I see you love the circus. I wish firemen could do that. - Those English, eh? - Sirs! Do behave! It's distracting! You're the one shouting, sir. There must be silence. As I have already warned you, there are spirits amongst us. Miss Reed demands silence! She warns you that the spirits here... demand attention. They'll punish anyone who neglects them. There will be a wonderful show, madam. I must ask you to leave the building. Can't you ever blend in, sir? Vasiliy. I will tell you what he is about to show you, sir. Perhaps a woman. Yes. The woman whom you have wronged. Every man has wronged someone or other. And is it a relief to know that you are like everyone else? May I request a translation? Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen! Shadows you hold dear to your hearts will appear in this hall for the briefest of moments. In this hall for a brief moment will appear spirits you hold dear to your hearts. Do not be afraid. Do not be afraid! You will be safe for my pentagram, my symbol of protection will keep them at bay. You are completely safe. For the pentagram, a symbol of protection, will prevent them from flying around the room. One. One! Those you have lost, those for whom you carry guilt. Those you have lost, and those before whom you still feel guilty. Two! Those you cannot forget. You will see them now. Where everyone else is deaf and blind. Where everyone else is deaf and blind... I see! Begone! I saw my dead mother. I wronged her. She used to love cherry jam. Once when she was eating, a bee flew in and I buried it in her jam with a spoon while she wasn't looking. As a joke. It turned out OK, but her tongue was swollen for 2 days. So you did in your own mother? Course not. She died of old age. Who did you see, sir? Nobody. Come on, I could see you saw someone. You're not a good liar. I can still see it. It's painted... all over your face. Really, sir! The dead are more interesting to talk to than you! I don't dare give you advice, madam, but I must ask, what's keeping you in St. Petersburg, when other cities are calling? This one calls me still. Now is the best time for more shows, they would be sold out. I'm upset that you won't tell me the whole truth. Pardon me. Allow me to introduce myself, Rostov. St. Petersburg Police Force. You are out of line! If you're the police, then find my book. What book? My magical grimoire, it is priceless and it has been stolen from me and the police have been of no help at all. I want to show you this. This egg was found stitched inside the body of a girl who was murdered last night. You know this symbol? I saw very similar one on your poster. Any chicken can lay an egg and any amateur can draw a pentagram on an eggshell. It is the most common- Miss Reed, you recognized this thing. Please look at me. Why are you here? Aren't you curious to see it again? To see her? Let's put her under round-the-clock surveillance. OK, I will assign two men to watch her. Sir, I think we should find out who could be taking revenge. Like in the East. Thieves get their hands cut off. Talkers get... their tongues torn out. Fornicators... - Well, anyway... - Have you been out East? How did you know? I have. When reading books. Sir. Being new, you have not met everyone yet. Nor they you. This is our best agent. Gopher. He's at home in any slum. A pure and selfless soul. Don't be afraid, Gopher. He's one of us. Money upfront, money. Quit harping on like a priest before service. Found out who the killer is? Well? I'll tell you the truth, sir, but nobody wants to pay for the truth. Money upfront. The devil's killing them. You're the devil, you madman! Give me the money back. I've been asking for seven days. Nobody did it. People are scared. They want to know, too. They say the devil's come - to St. Petersburg. - Return the money. That's detective work for you. But I'll make him talk. If detective work gave us the devil, then the devil with it. He sure is crafty. - He ought to do circus tricks. - Brilliant. Check your pockets, sir. Just in case. This is truly a wicked business, sir. I hope nobody finds out. Right, sir? Have another twenty-five. Nobody will find out, if you don't tell. Good morning, Lieutenant, sir. Good morning, Ganin. Sir. Do stop sleeping in your office. You've Saint Isaac's Cathedral on your cheek. I'm here to tell you some great news. - The Englishwoman? - What about her? She slept late. Then Mr. Golitsyn visited her. They lunched at Trushin's... It's dull. But we have a witness! Evpraksia Semenova, a psalm reader's widow. Who, on the 14th of May, was eating soup by the window and saw a man drag a girl into a big black carriage. - Any more detail? - More detail? After the... soup, made with beef stock, she had steamed fish cutlets. I don't mean that. Right. The gentleman dragging the girl was dressed warmly. A hood disguised his face. So she cannot describe his appearance. - Dressed warmly. - Yes. It was foggy. She described it most vividly. Said the carriage drove strangely. Sagging pronouncedly on the left. You said the Englishwoman is home? Do you think... she can summon... the murdered women's souls? I mean, she's a... a charlatan. The pretty ones all are. They trick and tame us. I thought you'd want to talk to cartwrights or hearse dealers? Perhaps a hearse was rented without cause. You're right. Here, look at this, my dear fellow. Look, if you draw a line here. And then here... Holy Lord! Then the next victim should be here. Kazan Cathedral. Almighty... - Let's go, you can pray on the way. - Sir, there's a fifth. - By Kazan Cathedral? - Yes. Notice the symbol on her chest. Bastard sewed it on well. Used a blanket stitch. Let's go. I can't watch. Terrifying times. - Who is she? - She's so young. Why don't you ever carry a weapon? Because I'm not planning to kill anyone. Have you found my book? There's been another murder in the city, Miss Reed. I'm sorry. Pardon me. No, I... I am only asking you to tell me something about this item's owner. My gift needs rest and recovery. I'm afraid I cannot help you. Please, Miss Reed. Do you feel anything? I always feel something. Fine. I will conduct a private seance for you. It will be 200 rubles. Um, 100? 250. I can't make anything out. It was a superb drawing. But hearse makers crumpled it up, like they do. You cartwrights, though... always a pleasure to work with you. Stepan! Take a look. Sagging at the rear left. Fix one like that? No, I never did. Are you certain this item belonged to the victim? Yes. I will only see what the deceased decides to show me. This will most likely be the moment of her death. Most spirits like to talk about this moment, it's understandable. It leaves such a strong impression after all. And so. Whatever happens, do not let go. The woman to whom this ring belonged, who departed from our world, come and speak. I see something. A dark street and a girl walking alone. She keeps looking back. There's a light ahead. She walks faster. Suddenly a man appears from an alley behind her, average height, dark hair, limping on his left leg. He catches up with her, And strangles her. Fear. Death. Pain. Enough, Miss Reed! You interrupted the seance. You are a liar! This ring belonged to my wife. How do you know she wasn't killed just now? How do you manage to fool your audience? Through hypnosis? Or some intoxicating smoke? Trickery with electricity? Cheap tricks. How dare you trifle with my gift. I was so close to believing you. Gather your things and follow me. You know, sometimes things go wrong, it happens. Why don't we try it again? Their element, you can talk directly to the dead, half price, 125 rubles and I'll find the killer. Marie Gerelo, governess, 30 years of age. Strangled, her brain was removed from the skull. Miss Krysta Pura, apprentice wife. Her tongue was cut out, and mouth sewn shut with a coarse thread. Olga Menor, homeless, 24 years of age, drained of all her blood, hands and feet cut off. Anna Berezina, a peasant from Scov, 35 years of age, her heart was removed and replaced with an egg with your star on it. They're on your soul. Odessa Kumkov, seamstress. 20 years of age, she was a seamstress. Eyeballs removed, eyelids stitched together. I've told you everything, Miss Reed, why so silent? Do the bodies scare you? These are dead people, not the spirits, not the souls, real dead. Talk to them, I won't interrupt. I don't want to be here. Shame. You want to put me down, break me. Why? You have a good face, you don't need to hide it. Let me go! Please! For God's sake! Anyone? Anyone? Colonel Rostov, please take me to him. You're bleeding, madam. A nervous spasm. I swear, there's been no violence. Go. Miss Reed. Mr. Rostov. I must tell you about a vision I had in your prison. Are you still trying to earn your money? I drowned in the black water of a narrow canal by a red castle. I am a tall, strong woman of 30, long hair. I live, I live in St. Petersburg. I am in pain and scared to death. I am broke, I am tied up and then I die. There was no escape. I feel her body- How dare you continue. Her pain. Back to the cell? You may leave. What? You are dismissed. Miss Reed, are you OK? Get a policeman! You don't know this city, but you manage to find the place perfectly. Please, Miss Reed, stop telling lies, it's useless. Would you like to attend the autopsy? Or do you know what we'll see there? What brand this time? Water. A triangle pointing downwards, the symbol of the element. These killings are part of a ritual. All these victims have a destination. Hell. I read in the Bible, that the end of the world would not be able to bed, A lot of times, it's about time anyway. Maybe then our Lord will finally return. If Hell comes to us, there will be no people. Christ will not come to a place with no people. I don't believe you. Just fill me in: What are you talking about? What have you lost? Who was that woman you saw in my seance? You are a liar. Don't you play your tricks on me. You know nothing about her. Ganin! Water! Hurry, my dear fellow. Miss Reed. Mi- You're some actress. I need a quill, no, a pencil and some paper please. Don't even try your witchcraft. These tricks don't work here. She was lying on the, no, no, she was sitting on the embankment. A pentacle. A black carriage brought her there. A man's hand with this tattoo. She's a real sorceress. That's Pavlusha the Deadman's tattoo. That's his sign. Skull, crossbones and the ace of spades. His sign, but would he do that? Victims disappear in his area. No one cares if low-lives go missing. But such barbaric killings in our city? He's never done that. It takes skills, to cut and sew... set everything up artistically. But if it was him... Who ordered goose and porridge? Bring the vodka and shot glasses. You can't play! You'll lose your shirt! And then your wife will show up! Bring that here! And more moonshine! He drowned at sea. Let's drink to his memory. Hello, Gopher. Remember me? You can't be here, sir. I need to find Pavlusha the Deadman. Can you help me, my dear? Leave this place. And go where? I won't go until I find Pavlusha. There's... police in disguise. They're grilling Gopher. Gopher, eh? They'll kill me, sir. I swear they will. Gopher! Pavlusha wants you in the kitchen. Where are you off to, boss? Does something... smell rotten to you? Step aside. Don't move, good people. Our soup will be extra meaty today! You the Deadman? You need a dead man? Here you are! He ducked out of so many scrapes. Why not this one? My, oh my. Death all around. Wanna chat, Pavlusha? The murdered girls. - Your handiwork? - Hell no! I've got enough sins of my own to take on those of others. Think again, Pavlusha. While I'm holding you. Who could it be? I saw him. In that case... Tell me what you saw. It was at night. By Kazan Cathedral. I was taking a walk. When I saw someone... carrying a woman. I thought he was going to dump her after having his fun. But then I noticed that she was blue. So I decided to teach the scumbag a lesson. Watch where the hell you're going! He killed her badly. Inhumanely. - So there's a good and humane way? - Don't know. But I figure there must be. If you're human. Otherwise, it's a free-for-all. What about Gopher? Gopher wasn't human! Where's the watch? Bloody hell, Ganin. We needed him for questioning. You killed a witness! Unlawfully, without due process. Courts are not the law. Justice is. I punished him justly. So now what? He's dead... and we have nothing. Except a made-up story about a watch. A watch? The bastard. Try to remember: Have you seen the watch before? We only wish to return it to its owner. An amazing... and delicate piece of work. Get to the point, will you? Why go round and round? When he first brought it to me, it didn't play music. He was such a... young man back then. He inherited the watch from his father. Who is he? To what do I owe the pleasure? Did you bring me a new find? We did, Mr. Golitsyn. What exactly? Your watch. How did you get it? Long story. Then again, we have much to tell each other. Get to work. What's happening?! What right do you have to barge into my house?! Put that back! It's a fragile and rare collectible! Sir, gather your patience. A search takes some time. Don't touch anything! Don't open the cabinet. It's empty! What's going on?! Are you deaf? I said, do not touch that! Hellish machine. Sir. Take a look, please. What's this, sir? I don't have to explain anything! Human blood? Or was the Good Sir slicing sausages? I owe you no explanations either. I haven't killed anyone. Arrest him. I curse you to be forever unhappy and alone. To spoil anything you touch, to destroy everything you hold dear and to die a painful death. Thank you, I like you too. Am I truly free this time? I need you as a witness. We're questioning a man, who we suspect committed the murders. Someone you know very well, Vasiliy Golitsyn. I so dreamt of gaining special powers. And knowledge. I truly hoped I'd succeed. I learned from the best, after all. I invited Miss Reed to Russia to learn from her. So it's Golitsyn, now I know where my book is. We didn't find the book, but we found a bloodstained clock. Oh, Vasiliy. I started giving him lessons in practical magic back in Moscow. I, I shudder to imagine what he really needed it for. Why were you in Moscow? I never killed anyone. Yes, I performed... rituals. But they were animal sacrifices. What for? Witchcraft is not against the law in Russia. But I didn't want the word to get out. Keys, please. Mr. Golitsyn is not the killer. May I? You changed your mind? He is not the killer, all this started when you and Mr. Golitsyn were in Moscow. Can you explain? The first murders in St. Petersburg were on April 2nd and 10th. When Golitsyn was in Moscow. May I ask... How did the killer get your watch? I knew one of his victims. Avdotya, the seamstress and laundress. She made garments... for my rituals. Washed off the blood and... helped with animals. I gave her the watch... as a thank you, and to keep her quiet. I hope you understand the devious circumstances that coincided against you. If you wish, you may file an official complaint. But I wouldn't advise it. How could you think so little of me? Needless to say your performances here are over. Olivia! I will walk you. But I don't understand, why kill the sixth? Your star has five points. The star is complete, but the ritual requires four more sacrifices, one for each of the elements, the sixth represents water. The killer will not stop till he claims his ninth victim, with fire. But where might other murders occur? Anywhere, I... The seventh is earth, then air. But I know exactly how the final ninth sacrifice will take place. Good start. The sacrifice to fire, that will be me. No, it won't. I will save you and I can save you. But if you have such a gift, why bother with all this ostentation? These tricks of the light? When you talk up a mound of beautiful nonsense, oh, how people appreciate it. Tea? Yes. I had the nightmares when I was a child, they were horrible, frightening. My father said I had demons inside me and I was made to believe it, Until one day I was found by a person, who seemingly accepted me for who I was, for who, what I was. Sugar? Hm. He saw my gift not as a curse, but as a way to make money. He became my mentor and later my husband. Life with him was a torment, but I loved him. He was all I knew. Every day was devoted to rehearsal and performance and if I failed at anything, he beat me. But I forgave him for the sake of our daughter, our Audrey. Then suddenly she got ill and died and he could not survive this. I only continued performing for money, because I knew no other life, I didn't want to know and I had lost my true gift. Give me some mercy, sir! For the sake of your God, sir! Give me some mercy! Give me some mercy, sir! I'm quick-witted. I'll keep silent. Let me go alive. For Devils's sake. And I had lost my true self. That is until now. It's Ok. You must decid. Otherwise you lose both your wife and the baby. But I'm not a doctor. A decision is better than regret. It is better to make a decision than to regret doing nothing. I never told anyone. I curse myself every day for my weakness. You went in search of your own death. So you left the guard, joined the army and came to the police. I understand guilt like no other. In that respect, we are speaking the same language. But please trust me. You cannot blame yourself. It is not your cross to bear. Crosses! I'm in the ground. Death. Earth in my eyes. What are you seeing? Keep going. - Water. - You recognize the place? A stone pier, monsters, gargoyles. Crosses everywhere. Nevskiy Cemetery, Lavra. But she's still alive. Olivia! Good afternoon, good people. What can I do for you, sir? Take a look. It sags at the rear left. Ever repair it? Replaced the parts on it. Still sagged, though. Do you remember the owner's name? I don't remember, sir. Do try. I might have the receipt. Here you go, sir. I always keep things in order. Oh God, Miss Reed! It's alright. You're OK, my dear. It's alright. Allons, Madame! Police Russe! Sometimes we do arrive in time. Shame on you! Drunk at this hour, sir! Or is this from last night? Why so merry? How did you get here? Who are you? I don't remember. Now I remember. What a drunk. Here's the air. Sir! This the murderer? That's a servant. Sir, in the cellar... Come take a look. What's that? If I only knew. FESTIVE FIREWORKS 20TH OF THE MONTH I heard a famous British artist is performing tonight. I wonder what kind of show he is going to put on. Look how beautiful! Help. Help! Help! Help! Somebody help! James. I thought, - I hoped you were dead. - I survived. We have to bring our daughter back to life. Our girl. She died. The dead cannot come back. The dead cannot come back. You are about to realize that that is not true. The show has already started. Get out of the way, sir. Watch out! Be careful! Kindred blood will pour into the flames. That is what it says in the Holy Book. Let me pass. Out of my way. Olivia, you are key to the ritual. You are the ninth sacrifice. Please. Help! Nobody can help you now. This is Hell and it belongs to me. My poor Olivia, you never did learn the most important lesson. Only what you believe in is real. I lost, I lost the being, that was the dearest thing in the world to me and I can get her back by spilling the blood of one of her parents. Is that price really so high? Stop! Is this part of the show? Police! James! Uh! Uh! I made a promise, that I wouldn't let you get hurt. But I didn't keep my word. Don't go. I've only just found you. I don't understand your English.
