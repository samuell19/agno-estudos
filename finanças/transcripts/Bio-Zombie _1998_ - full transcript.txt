It starts now. Pal, sit down! Set the machine first. How long is this film? It seems... I don't know. How is it? There are two gays sitting closely to watch the movie. Forget about that! I don't want to know such thing. Isn't this a gay film? I don't think so. I saw a lovely girl sitting over there. Where is it? Over there... The third row on the right. Looking from her back, I think she looks great. Pal, mind your cigarette. Are you kidding me? You call this pretty? I am sorry... I want to stool now. What? You are leaving!? Yeah. Are you kidding me? Hey man, I've found a loafer here! Yeah. Yesterday was May 8th. Yeah. So today is May 9th. No, it's the 4th day of the 8th moon. I want to watch a film. What the hell? We always watch movies here. See who is coming? Hi, girl? You look thin, are you on diet? That's none of your business, creep! Woo, it's so big! Bye bye. So big is the light! It costs only one hundred. Guess, do you think it's easy to put the atenna inside? I feel happy to touch it either! Say you say you love me... Say you say you love me... What's the matter? Brother Kui. You have got many new products. Why do you open your shop so early? We are making a living from this shop. It's shit to copy you! You return to your shop in late afternoon! You're right, we are shit! How is your business today! That's right! No business, why open the shop early? You creep! Just bluffing, OK? Brother Kui, we are leaving now. Brother Kui, smile! You look ugly! What's the matter, hubby? You know nothing! Do your waxing if you have time! Bye bye. Rolls. 30% discount for eating shisimi. It's better than no discount. Come on, Bother Loi. Rolls has come for just one week. You treat her to snacks everyday, but I've come for one year, why aren't you that nice to me? Am I that bad? Don't fool me, Jelly? Don't bother! Just be nice to me, OK? Let's go, Cindy is alone in the shop. Rolls, I have bought you a present. May I see you when I am off? Sure! I'll wait for you. I think he is falling for you! Jesus! But I am not falling for him! Say you say you love me... What are you staring at! Haven't you seen a beauty before? How many did he give you? Some. You are nosy! Give me one, OK? Twenty dollars please. I want to try your mouth. You're money minded. Jelly... How is it? What? This is... Do you want to court her? Rolls, this is Woody Invincible, this is Crazy Bee. Hi. How are you! Which shop is yours? That VCD shop. It's small business. We just want to kill time. It's shit to make a living from it, it's not enough to keep my car. Want some tea? Don't you have to work? Do you have to work? I haven't earned a penny this day. Do you want to buy something? It's for women! How can I help? Even men do facial. Buy ten coupons for me please, it costs you only 4 thousand. Four thousand and something? Just four thousand. Sure! I'll come back again, I forgot my wallet. You are not closing now, are you? Damn it! He is wasting my time. It's shit! Should I waste few thousand to court her? I don't need that much to have fun in nightclub. Why should I court her? If I am rich one day, I would pay her to do facial for me with her tongue. Damn it! Damn it! Hey, guy, are you stealing? Boss, I can't watch this clearly. Are you lying? It's true? Is there something wrong? I can't see Steven Chou in this movie. You know Steven Chou stars in this film... but you said you couldn't see him? How can I watch this? The vision is moving. This is a special fell, you know MTV? You know who did the shooting? No, the first ten minutes... I couldn't see anything. First ten minutes is like that, the next 80 minutes would be clear. It doesn't cost much, you know? If you want to watch clearly, go to the theatre! You cheat money! What did you say? How dare you say we cheat? I would shoot you to death, you know? Who are you? Where did you study? You want to mess up here? Well, I am so nice to let you take some porno videos with you! Choose any two, come on! Move fast? Hurry up! I warn you! Mind your lips. I would blow your head off, I know where you live, OK? Go. If all clients are like you, you'd better be the boss! Who is it? It's me. Yes, boss... How is the business? Stop messing up. Quiet please! So many customers are crowded in the shop! It's great! Get my car from the garage for me right now. Alright, see you... Close the shop now. Why? Let's go to get the car for boss. What? Anything will do. Four six... Six four... Four six... One five. One five. Four six. One five. Six four. Four six. One five... Four six... It's fixed! Can I get my car an hour. I've been waiting for an hour. Move! Don't just care of gambling! If I punch you, you should stay where you are. That's it. If you gamble, you won't have a fortune. If you gamble, you will lose all you have. Well, we lost everything, finished! It's your fault! You shouldn't bet on the same horse which I chose. You bring me bad luck! It's your fault! I told to bet at the some counter. We have always won! You just didn't listen. I told you! It's Jockey Club's fault. They shouldn't have held the race. That's right. Let's work hard again! I have faith to win my money back. What? So big are the balls! It's as big as a fist. See that side! It weights a kilo! It's really big! It think it's big enough to put a mobile phone inside. It's disgusting! Are you pulling off a stunt? What? Are you scaring me? Let's fight! What the hell? You bastards are playing tricks here, aren't you? Do you want to fight? If you have guts, drop the spanner and fight one to one. One to one? I mean it! Bee, you go first. I come to take my boss's car, why should fight with you? That's right! It doesn't worth a fight! What time is it now? Use your brain but not your fists, you know? If you have time, think how to repair a car! Or, study hard for the horse race! Mr. Big Balls. That's right. Alright, just take it as our fault. We need the car now, I am sorry. Say sorry... come on! I'm sorry. It's alright, let's move. Chinese Kung-fu team? Stay where you're when I want to punch you! Want to kill me? You moron. Yung Ba-na, my boss Chan Kam-shing. Don't panic, it's alright. Don't be afraid. He said, for producing bio-chemical weapons, even the Americans are no match for the Iraqis. The guy drank half bottle of liquid. Now, he scares nothing. Soft drink? It seems like soft drink. Isn't it soft drink? Don't drink it, use your brain, would you? Be smart! He said, you can try it now. No! Why were you afraid of those garage boys? Were I? Let's go back for revenge. I'll support you! I've got weapon, see? I am just waiting for you! Fast! Do you want me to speed up? Sit tight! Fast enough? I saw a man! Man, how are you? Don't die! Shut up! I told you not to ask me to drive fast! Let's run! Why do you park your car here? My friend... He drank much and he wanted to throw up... Yeah... It's going to be fine! Yeah, he is going to be fine! Are you alright? Yeah, sir... Few thousand bottles... No! I mean few thousand for a bottle of red wine, what a waste! Next time, I should treat you to beer. Move the car as soon as possible, OK?

If the traffic police returns, we'll be in deep shit. How is that bastard? Shit! Crash again! What a shit! What? He isn't dead. Bastard! How dare you spit on me? Are you alright? I am fine. Does it hurt? No! No! Will you come back to change your VCD again? No... Bring more friends to buy VCDs from us, got me? Yes, yes... By the way, what made you spit to us? Sudden emotion! What the hell? How dare you spit on us? I'll blow your head off. Did we leave anything in the car? It's me. Boss? Have you got my car yet? Yes, we've got it, but the front isn't that nicely done. I'll drive the car to you later. Hurry up! Damn it! It stinks like hell. Damn it! What does this mean? If you have guts, don't ruin this car but come to us directly. Damn it! Get out now, you bastard! Come out! You have get weapon, go and see what the hell is it. Aren't you scared? What are you doing here? To sign on the patrol record. Finish? Yes. Then move! Do you worry that the guy would come back for revenge? I wish he would! So he can never escape. It's you? I didn't take my phone along. What? I just dislike you! If you have guts, come back to me, my name is Woody Invincible! You are not qualified to listen to this. It's useless to apologize. I'll get you be all means. He thinks I am a dumbbell! Well, let's go now. How about the car? Let's gather some money to pay the boss. Alright, I'll support you. Brother Kui, haven't you seen that? It's perfect. Did you drop it? It's scratched. Come on! This is no avoidable! Just a slight scratch. You are so wise, Mrs. Kui. You know nothing! Is this your business or mine? Woman, shut up! Please help! I am in need of money to save my life. You always need money to save your life, Mr. Invincible. Well, I'll give you a hand. $1,500. What? See this one, same model, different color, your charge for $2,000! Please don't fool me.

How much do we have now? Well, 13,000 that's all we have got. How much does Ken ask for? Twenty thousand. Bastard! What a creep! I introduced him to his business, how can he charge me $20,000? That's right! How about the rest? Let's go to Macau to gamble. Good idea! Should we whore first, or whore after gambling? No, this isn't a good idea. If we lose, that would be shit! We can solve it anyway. Give way please. Is it your private road? What are you doing? I am going to rob. Rob? I think you are going to kill! I will kill one person sooner or later. I told you this. You need this one? So no one can recognize me. Why the food is so late! Damn it! Hey, what do you want? Come out and have a chat, OK? What do you want? Just go ahead. I know I offended you. Well, I hope you are not that mean. I don't know what you a talking about. I have just been robbed by two bastards inside the toilet. So what? I have been here all day. Stop pretending, you know what I am talking about. What do you mean? Give me a price. How much do you want to get that two bastards for me? What was robbed? A diamond ring, it's newly bought. Diamond ring? Five thousand. Why that much? How about treating you to dinner, OK? You need to pay someone to work for you, right? Please. I am not used to be flattered. I bought that ring with all money I had, please help me. What will make me help you? I will treat you to a dinner. That ring is a fak... Fake... what? Think! I think I can help! Leave it to us.

Of course not, I just suspect that. Would you question them for me? It's a piece of cake to seduce them, but how to question them? They won't admit it. Woody Invincible said he would treat us to dinner. When he drinks much, he will confess everything. Well, it sounds great! I am ready for the dinner now! What a chick! So bad! Sushi boy, what is recommended today? Everything is nice. Well, take anything which is nice. Everything is nice. What is the best? Everything is good, what do you want? Well, give me "Everything".

Do you want to kill him? Be frank, if you go, I'll help. I will kill him after a sleep. Well, I will take a rest too. Woody Invincible, Crazy Bee, come out. You bastards! What the hell is it? Go, go... Don't move! Let's have a good talk first. Crazy Bee, beat him! Let's talk first. Damn it! Do you still want a fight? Just a piece of glass is broken! But you haven't lost anything. We didn't do it. If it's done by me, it would have been messy! What do you think? The thief broke the glass for a phone? You must have given him a low price, he wasn't satisfied so he broke you glass to take his phone back. So simple! That's right, the stolen phone was sold by you! So, this is your business now. I would not do such thing! That's right. You know very well about the phone. How do I know! The sushi boy was beaten. The phone shop was messed up. Isn't it done by that guy for revenge? But he should go right to us. He mistook the wrong guy! How about this place? What the hell is it? Have you reached any conclusion? It's you who made such mess. Well, you should pay me $3000. You mean you are going to pay us $3000? That's a good idea. This is made of the mud of the Mediterranean Sea. It costs at least 6 to 7 hundred. Now, I'm giving you a 50% discount cause you are my friend. Well, you say nothing, then I'll bill you. You have got an acne. Well, I have something good for you, please wait. Three thousand?! None of our business! That's right. Don't you want to pay? I'll ask my fellows here to judge this case. Forget it, this is peanut... You know nothing! Get lost now! If I let them go like this, how can I face the world? Do your waxing if you have time! Well, you don't want to pay for it? OK. Sai-fai, I've a problem. Get 50 fellows to my shop. Are you going that far? Are you scared? So, pay me now. I have plenty of fellows, you know? It's none of my business, your know? Woody, this is Sai-fai, Kui wants help, but he won't pay and he doesn't have face. Do you wanna help? Kui is calling for help, but he won't pay and doesn't have face. No one is going to help, so do you want us to help? Here we are. Brother Kui, what do you want us to do now? Just tell us. You have plenty of fellows, haven't you? Well, you don't want to pay me? I'll let you pay for it one day. Come one! Do it now, don't wait. You are Kui, you are not King! You have plenty of fellows, is that right? Close the shop now, you've waxed for half day! Are you alright? Let's go. Dismiss. Stay! I called the police, they are on the way here. Are you sick! Look before you leap! Why did you call the police? This is peanut! Stay where you are when I give you a punch! What the hell? Why do you call the police? Alright, leave now. He is damn stupid! It's not a joke, man! That's right. Guess, are we going to be like Kui when we get old? I mean, no one will help and will be bullied by kids instead. Of course not! I don't think so. That's right! We won't live until 40. You won't live till 40, but I will have long life. You will die before 40, I guess. Watch your step! Bastard! What? Do you want to scare me? I wanted to beat you, you know? What the hell? You want to act as "Terminator"? Do it. I think there is something wrong with the sushi boy. He just wanted to scare us, did he scare the sit out of you? Sir, I didn't call the police, it's Ox who did it. But the glass of your shop is broken. That's none of your business. It's useless to question me. A, we are not questioning you. B, did anyone break the glass and steal something from your shop? No! I quarreled with my wife and we broke the glass carelessly. That's right. Got it? Sir, can you leave now? Do you think we cops are fools? I see you guys up there! Don't be sneaky in front of me. Don't you wanna go! You're surrounded by cops now. Do you need to do this? Tonight between 6 to 10pm, where were you? I had dinner with my friends. What did you eat? Japanese food, in that restaurant. How much time did you spend for the dinner? Around an hour. Then? Then, we went for a movie. Together? No, that guy suddenly left in the middle of the movie. Where did he go? The girl drank too much, that bastard left with the girl. They said they wanted to do something. What's next! Next? Tickets were sold out, then we left and ate dessert. Dessert? Well, what's next? After that, we went back to the arcade, then we knew the robbery. I was in the toilet and saw that bastard... and that sushi boy, and a woman, many people were there. Then I knew the robbery happened in the phone shop. See, the statements of that two guys differ a lot. They've gone too far! Sir, I told you the truth. Me too! Sir! I told the truth. The statements don't match, but they said they told the truth. You want to fool me, don't you? Anybody else found in the arcade? Some girls who work in the beauty parlor, and a sushi boy. I couldn't find them in their shops. Couldn't find them. Couldn't find them, hum? The sushi boy was beaten in the toilet. Sir, you stare at me like this, you think I'm involved, don't you? Don't frame us. A, I stare at you, it, doesn't mean I am suspecting you. B, look at you! I can tell you have done something sneaky. C, don't frame me, I am a tax payer, you know? D, better find that guy to make everything clear. Let's move to the control room and we can clear everything. What the hell is this arcade? It's as quiet as hell! Fast forward please. Alright. What are you watching? Watch TV now! Don't stare at us, we won't leave. Pan the camera and let the officer watch clearly. Are you sick? You can't pan this camera. Sir, is your partner insane? You should't ask this question, this is my partner. Follow me. You have freedom to ask, but you should co-operate with us. This is not a joke. I warn you, I am serious, he is my partner. You should be well prepared. We will never co-operate again! I repeat, we'll never co-operate again! Police, hands up! Sir! Are you pulling off a stunt? Hands on the wall. I tell you... What? You abuse violence, so? What do you mean? You are abusing violence now! Don't move, otherwise I will shoot. You need not take my phone away. I just love it, so what? Sir, we just wanted to scare him. He was beaten long time ago. That' none of our business. Now, you'd be responsible for it too. Don't frame us, you bastard! So, you did the robbery, is that right? No, sir. His wish is to be a cop. He just wanted to disguise as a cop to scare him, to read his I.D. Only. But he lost his temper and left. I told him not to do like that. See, can you read the lips? I am not lying. What is this? What is this? Well you wish to be grass seller, don't you? Grass? How come there is grass? I remember! I checked the wallet of the sushi boy and found this. I thought this is funny, so I took it out and... and put inside this wallet. This is grass, isn't it? This's drugs, we can't touch it! It'll ruin our future! Now, I am going to charge your with drugs possession. Sir, we are so strong, we don't seem to be drug addicts. See! We look great! We won't take grass. No more denial! Cut that bull shit! No, sir! That's not bull shit! His wish is to be a lawyer. Maybe he studied too much, so he is a bit nagging. And he is gentleman like. And, we work in Central, you know? Today is our day off, so we came to take care of our daddy's shop. We just come there for fun. We're going to a home for the elderly to give voluptuary service. If we are late, we'll fell... we'll give bad impression to the grannies. You understand? So, sir, would you please let us go? Finished? Any more bull shit? Do you think this is a debate competition? Shut up! I didn't say anything. May 9, today is your birthday! You rob on your birthday, a special way to celebrate, isn't it? Why didn't you tell me about your birthday? I told you! Who knows what the hell you hinted! Yesterday was May 8, today is May 9... Just tell me this is your birthday. I always take you as my buddy. Happy birthday. Thank you. It's the sushi boy! Yeah. The girl of the beauty parlor is going with him. Go and take a look now! Are you telling me? 3001, go down and take a look. 9466, you go down and take a look. Why don't you take my order but order in return? Let's follow the old rule. Come on! Go! You don't know you look ugly, do you? What's up? What are you doing here? Let me go! Let me go! Don't go. You bastard! Damn you! You are Hakkin people, aren't you? Yeah, so you are my homeboy! What's your name? Ox. Me too! What a coincidence! May I have a cigarette? Great! I'll do it myself. Why did you steal? I didn't! I am framed by that damn cop. Hey, you are muscular, but why do work as a security guard? You think this is my wish? Qualifications go first when you look for a job, right? If I had a chance to study, I would have become a judge! You have a nice job, haven't you? Sure! I need not pay tax, I always get up late, I whore any time like. And, I am free to take grass... Damn it, I feel great. Well, it depends. Give me a can of soft drink, would you? We are buddies, sure! Damn cops! What is this place? This is the security office. That bastard really comes back for revenge. Don't come over. I'll shoot! Shoot his head! Where are those stuffs? It's alright. Isn't if fixed? We should find a better way to leave. Home boy, are you alright? Wake up, fatty! Get up to help! Why do you sleep? Fatty, get up to get me the keys! He has just bitten by that zombie. Hurry up! Move faster, OK? I don't know where the key is. Hurry up, Crazy Bee! Buddy, I didn't offend you! You were so nice to give me a cigarette. We are from the same hometown, please don't bite me. Hurry up! Don't come over! I wanna like you! Hurry up! Bee! Hurry up! Bee! Buddy... This is shit! Watch out! Mind my hand, your bastard! Kui, zombies are around, let's run for our lives! Run! Damn it! Are you threatening me? Hubby, they don't seem to be kidding! You know nothing! You moron! How can you trust this? That two bastards stole something, they worry that I'd report to police, so they threaten us! I will make you pay for it tomorrow. Let's go. The policemen want us to wait for them. Can't you see? Everyone is gone! Why standing here? Jelly, let's run! What's the matter? Oh shit! At our back! Hubby, what's wrong with the light? Can't you walk without lighting? Can you please wait for me? So, you'd walk faster and don't let me wait for you. Hubby, I think something's wrong. Are there zombies? If there is zombies, I'll eat them up. Where are you going? Let's walk downstairs! We should take the lift instead! Haven't you walked enough? You know? This is first floor! Run faster! What are you afraid of? Let's go! See? What are you afraid of? Run! Hold it! You hang on! I can't! You hang on! Wait for me, bastard! No! You'd better run first. There are zombies at the car-park. Run, bastard! Run! Run, bastard! What are you doing? Crazy Bee, take the keys. Run! What are you doing? Take it! Run! Wait for me... Come here and hide up! Damn! What should we do now? Where are Cindy and Rolls? They must be caught by the sushi boy. That's why he looks like the "Terminator". She'll become a zombie any time. More her away first. Alright, you do it. If you don't want to co-operate, just leave her right here. Let's become zombies together, you bastard! Alright, each of us will send a representative to do it. I'll let her do it. No! You do it! You moron! You are shit! I don't want you to do it! Bee! Cindy, don't transform to be zombie please. I haven't offended you. Don't transform now, please, pal... Hurry up! Hurry up! Run! Run... Hurry up open the door. Remove his head! I wanna burst your head off! Zombie? I wanna kill him! I won't give it a damn! Open up, bastard! I am sorry... Don't waste any bullets. Woody Invincible! No! Right, let's think a better way. Call the police. Move now. You do it. Of course, I will call the police... No answer. It's not connected. There is telephone in the shop. I can't make it, I am scared. I am really scared. No! No! Give me the keys. Hurry up! Eat... Come on! Eat! Rolls! Woody Invincible. No! Let's run! Shit! They've left for quite a long time, what happens now? Yeah, what happens now? Let's care nothing now. Anything to eat? I am dawn hungry! We have cup noodles only. Then, move it! Hurry up! Thank you. Better hurry up! This is yours. Thank you. What's it? What? You know I love sea food flavor, but you gave that to him and left me this? I am sorry, I've just forgotten. Take this. Why don't you eat mine? What do you mean? She doesn't mean it! What the hell do you want? What's between you? You want my wife to eat your noodle? I didn't. Dare you take that? Stop the bull shit, would you? This is family business, you bitch, you shut up!
