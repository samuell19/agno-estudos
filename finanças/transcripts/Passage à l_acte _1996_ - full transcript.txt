Death in Therapy Because he died with you, the same day, at the same time, you, Pauline and Christian, his children, whom he talked about with such pride, and you, Lilia, his wife, whom he loved having by his side, this car accident, so cruel and barbaric, ties you to the tribute we are paying him today: your father, your husband, the master of several generations of clinicians. Sylvain Meyer was upright, because he spoke and wrote for others. He was cheerful because he could win the hardest battles with his mind. He was resolute because his strength rose up like a flame, sure of itself, unflinching, dauntless. Whoever felt what it's like, in these troubled times, to meet a coherent personality, will understand what psychiatry and psychoanalysis lost with Sylvain Meyer. A few months later... Doctor, I'm sorry, the tube stopped for 10 min! Maybe even 20! As you're only 16 minutes late, I suppose you're actually early. - Hello, Dr Rivière? - Speaking. This is Mr Risse. I'm sorry to bother you, but today is the 5th... Yes, so? You're running an overdraft. For us... - For you what? - You're in the red. You can't pay your loan, and my bank may go to court. Let's not panick. You agreed for me to move, didn't you? And to develop my practice? Don't act as if you were surprised! I've put my car on sale to settle my debt. - In a month... - No way! You owe us 3 instalments! There'll be another one soon! The most I can give you - is 2 weeks. - OK. 2 weeks. Goodbye, Mr Risse. Actually, if I think about it... If I really think about it... I'm getting married for him. Because of him. I told my dad. But he seemed so sad... I don't think he understood. Yesterday, I drove to Gisors with him. An hour there, with my anxiety, an hour back, with his silence. I waited for him to ask, to tell me something. - What should your father have said? - Everything. What he thinks, what he feels, that I shouldn't get married. Do you know why you're getting married? I'm getting married... because... I need to be able to. I want to see if I'm a grown-up. If I can live alone. Without him. You told me you didn't love your husband-to-be. I often despise him. Because he's not as good as your dad? Henri is nice. But it's true: he's spineless, sluggish. Eccentric, too. He doesn't want to do anything before. Not even... sleep next to me. It's rare. Maybe I'd like that not too change. Am I being horrible? Are you divorced? When I come on Wednesdays, there's a boy. But I never saw a woman. You're divorced. Since my mother died, my dad and I have locked ourselves into... That's enough for today. Is it time? It's not easy. Goodbye. Fabienne, I'm off to Gallimard's. Go and have lunch. If Mr Crevoisier calls, tell him to come, I'll manage. See you. What Freud Forgot to Tell Us We should go soon. Let's go. What about my patients? There are lots of pretty girls, analysts can look further than their couch to find the one. "The one", really! Weren't you already married once? Are you heading back? No, I'm going to meet a brilliant politician. - About his first novel. - Did he write it? I can't tell you that. Shall I drop you off? I'll get a taxi. It's on my way. I'll drop you off. Waiter. Fabienne? Did Mr Davenne call to cancel? No, he didn't. Thanks. Estates Where the Police Doesn't Go Anymore - I'm early. - That's OK, come in. I'm already getting calls. There's no turning back. I need to organise visits. Is selling my Vésinet house a good way of forgetting the past? You haven't said anything about my living at a hotel. Well OK. You don't care. It's not easy to make you react, as a patient. Maybe you mix us all up. Do you remember what I told you about my wife? Do you? Of course. I told you she had left me, and now lived in Brazil. Well, I lied, Dr Rivière. My wife is dead. I know it for a fact since I killed her myself. I know what you'll say: "Hmm, this rentier is now accusing himself of murder." You don't believe me? When she didn't believe me, Laura would say: "I don't know where the plate begins and where the chicken ends." You shouldn't think I'm a storyteller. So? What does an analyst do in this situation? Respect the secret of confession? Call the police? I think he should handle the situation professionally. You, Dr Rivière, are a real professional. So there. The real professional hit the jackpot: yours truly... is a bastard and a murderer. If you'll excuse me. It's my 3:30 patient. He's too late. Tell him I'll see him on his next appointment. I had errands to run and ran late. I'm sorry, but Dr Rivière can't see you now. I dropped by just in case. Tell him I'll pay for today's session next time. Thank you, miss. Thank you. Was that Mr Davenne? It's some neurosis this guy has! Do you know him? A little. Our symptoms go well together: he's late, I'm early, so we often meet. After I killed Laura and got rid of the body, I reported her missing. Seemed like the smart thing to do. "Liar!" No, I'm not lying, Dr Rivière. You can check. At the police station, a journalist listened to my story. It was in Le Parisien on 14 December. It even mentions how I was cleared. That's enough for today. Thank you. This is the one where my ad was published. There's only one in Le Vésinet. Did you see it? Goodbye. Hi, Antoine. - Hi, how are you? - Fine, you? Hi, good-looking! Juliette. Go on, get up and say... Go on. - What do you say? - Hello. Hello, goddaughter. How are you? - Hello. - Hello. Simon sends his love. He invited Charles over. Is that OK? - Of course. How's Simon? - He's great. He's just sad you didn't pick him up last week-end... To end our divorced couple business, here's the literature on his holiday camp. Have a look, it seems fine. It's for children aged 10 or more. There are either one or two lessons in the morning. Give your son your advice. He'll be amazed you care about him. Do you want whisky? Yes, please. No ice. So we'll be able to read the Meyer anthology soon. Speak for yourselves! I've had enough of Meyer. Why enough? You're just such a groupie sometimes! Just let your ex-wife live her life, don't be jealous. Florence has better things to do than anthologies. Like the congress you're organising? Your sexy therapy congress? It's "sex therapy". OK, as you wish, but no wonder you get criticised. As if he minded! Rosine thinks that all analysts are pistoleros. Not at all! Why are you saying this? I'm talking about Antoine, not you or all analysts. I agree with Florence. Antoine is being foolish so he gets run down. Looks like I'm in for a rough time! First the primal scream, then behaviourism, then sexology. No wonder they attack you! Don't push it too far. Antoine is an ethical person too. Antoine is different. He can't get enough patients. Money goes to your head! What are you judging me from? What do you know of my practice? Just because I drive a Mercedes, my patients are rich? Most of them are since your fees are prohibitive. Nice discussion we've got going. Let's carry on over dinner. Hello. My name is Mr Alfonsi. I'm calling about the car. I'll be at your house at 8 pm, as suggested in the ad. Mr Alfonsi. I wonder why I'm the one who should be in therapy. What's more... I can see them coming a mile off. They're so unsubtle! It's obvious what they think: "I'll screw her, then I'll throw her away." I'm so stupid, I fall into the trap every time. One day, a loser will offer me to make love in his car, in an underground car park to make the most of the fee. The Automaton There's no point, I won't make it. My crime is a burden and you're not interested in it. Would you like me to be? I do, I think it could help. A body never gives you any respite. Laura's body immediately looked at me, mockingly, as if to say: "What will happen next?" The next step is now. It may last for years, like a psychoanalysis. You told me you were a patient of Dr Meyer's. Why did you start with him? It's about time you asked. You never did. Dr Meyer was more suspicious. You didn't answer me. I'll answer, don't worry. I'm here to say everything. But tell me first. What? That you believe me, that you take me seriously, that I'll now be a special patient. Don't tell me you have other murderers. We'd save time if you just checked the facts. It would be so easy. Le Parisien dated 14 December, at the newspaper's archive. That's enough for today. Here's your fee. Thank you. Jacques... give me a coffee. Sébastien. With a fag, you'd look like a prisoner. I don't smoke. It's a symptom. You'd be happier if you did. - Think so? - I'm kidding. It's just a phase. It can happen to anyone. Know what they say? "Even Homer nods." I haven't been paid for my translations. I'll pay you back next week. Whenever you like. Whenever you can. Don't end your therapy. How is it going? It's progressing. I'm working on the relationship with my mother. That's amazing. No, I'll get it. Now go, you'll be late again. Good luck! "Sébastien, you're a dead loss." My mother would say that when I walked with her. It suits me. It's precisely what I am. Davenne the dead loss. Sorry? I thought you'd said something. No. Keep going. I'm getting deaf on top of everything else. I'm already falling apart at 32. And I'm trying to get students interested in Greek... To my mother, I was a dead loss, and to my students, I'm a no-hoper. It was written on the board the other day. "No-hoper." I wonder who taught them that. Maybe it's me. I always give people sticks to beat me with. Yes... Now I feel alive! Do you always drive this fast? I do everything fast. OK. I have a cheque. Just fill in the order. And I brought the standard form for the sale. - It's 220,000. - But it's a certified cheque. You'll get the money in five minutes. I can see you're experienced. It's the letter from the doctor who sent him over. - Do you want to talk to him? - No, I already did. Imagine I'm an intern and dazzle me with your experience. - Hello, sir... - Hello. - ...Sotigui? - Yes. Is it your first time here? It is. - Where are you from? - Mali. - That's the problem. - Being from Mali? No. Why? There's no problem. That's the problem. What do you mean? There's no problem. But you asked me: "Mr Sotigui, where are you from?" It's a question, right? And if there's a question, it means there's a problem. I think we should go over the chronology of these past weeks. At the moment, you're living at a friend's, a taxi driver. No, I'm a taxi driver myself. You currently drive a taxi. No. Currently I don't. I'm studying law. - It's a test, isn't it? - Not at all, dear colleague. - Mr Sotigui... - Yes. The friend you're living with is a taxi driver, isn't he? No, he stands in for me. He's Cuban, like Fidel Castro. That's the problem. Mr Sotigui, Dr Rivière... "Dr Rivière"? Who is Dr Rivière? - I am. - I know, but who else is? - Nobody else. - Really? In a hospital of such international renown, there's only one Dr Rivière! Hello. I'd like to see a back issue. Please fill in this form. Your name here, and here, the date of the issue you need. Here. Thank you. Mr Rivière. Did you call yesterday? The archivist left me the article you asked for. - You did call yesterday? - Yes, of course. A Woman Disappears Mr Berg was released and the case seems to be closed Hello, doctor. It's Geneviève Cazade. The general meeting of the 16 could take place at... This is Hélène Carisse. I'd like to know when... Antoine, it's Marc, I called the health centre, but you'd left. Please come to the police station. We need to talk. But don't worry, it's just about... I'll tell you in person. Bye. Thank you. Hello. Detective Belgrand. Antoine Rivière, one of our finest analysts. And a childhood friend. Thank you. Please sit down. So. I asked you to come for a professional matter. Tell me: can you hate your analyst so much you try to kill him? Your Mercedes had an accident. The driver died. His name was Alfonsi. Did you know him? Yes, I sold him the car. He seemed to be a reckless driver. Here's what's left of him. We wondered whether one of your patients had fiddled with your car so you'd go off the road. Your colleague Meyer died in a car that might have been tampered with. What? No one ever mentioned that. Listen, we have no certainty, no lead. But what happened to your car got me thinking. Here. - This is for you. - What is it? A list of Meyer's patients. There are a lot: from the hospital, the health centre... Have a look at it and call me if you know someone. Meyer trained you. Maybe after killing the master, someone tried to kill the pupil. Any of your intuitions can help us. You know... I don't see the connection. Take your time. Fucking Berg. He never was a patient of Meyer's. What is he up to? I'm glad you went to Le Parisien. That way you saw an old picture of me. I don't know where they got that picture. Will you admit I'm no storyteller now? It's all in there, even the official happy ending, which I hadn't told you yet: Laura supposedly running away with her Brazilian lover. Believe me, it wasn't easy for me. Laura was discreet, she never shouted. But I needed her to scream so the neighbours would hear. It takes so much energy to make a woman scream sometimes! I slapped her and slapped her, but all I got was a long moan. As we lived in a villa, that wasn't enough. How could the neighbours have heard a moan? - It wasn't possible. - Mr Berg! I think that's enough. No. I must go on. Consider it a fantasy, I don't care, but let me! Freud listened when his patient told him that rats were crawling up his arse, and you can't listen to an average headcase? So I went to get dinner ready. A medium-cooked steak with chips. And so... boiling oil. I returned to the living room, Laura was whining and... zoop! I poured the pan over her shoulders. The screams I was waiting for came out of her mouth, loud enough to wake up the whole town. She jumped up, turned towards me, and screamed even louder. So I screamed too. I broke a vase. I said she cheated on me. She didn't listen, but the noise moved to the kitchen, across the garden and to the street. The neighbours imagined a tragedy. "She's cheating on him!" Sing, my little dove, sing. She collapsed, unconscious from of the pain. Laura, Laura... I took a pillow and suffocated her. "She accepted death "With a simple and obedient heart." Feuilles de saints, Paul Claudel. So there you are, doctor... in horror, up to your neck, like me. I'll break a rule and stop here. These memories disgust me. I said "memories", not "fantasies". Here's the address of our house in Garches, so you can check. A big house at a junction. The gate isn't locked. In the back of the garden on the left, there's a shed. Yesterday, I dug up Laura's dress. I hung it there for you. It's sticky like a shroud. You can't miss it. You will go, won't you? See it with your own eyes? You didn't pay for this session. Édouard Berg. Daumier and Mermoz. Garches, 92380 I'm a wimp. A wimp filled with Greek and Latin. But still a wimp. And one day, the wimp will blow his brains out. Like his brother did. He has what he needs. What's in there? Your brother's pistol, is it? Give it to me right now. My brother killed himself on a 1st of May. My mother found him. She said it was a nuisance because it was a bank holiday. You don't have to repeat your brother's story: give it to me. Go on. Take care of it. It's the only one I have. What Berg Forgot to Tell Us You know, I wouldn't have let Berg speak that way. What would you have done? Shut him up? Of course. You don't have to listen to everything patients say. But you do hear some good ones... You direct the therapy, not him. You think I'm being foolish too. You don't have anything to prove to your colleagues or even yourself. A therapy isn't a battle... I didn't come for an inspection! - Knowing the truth matters! - Yes. But we're not interested in police or media truth. We shouldn't investigate, delve into people's past, search their hearts. Anyway, this Berg case isn't that serious. He's a pervert but certainly not a murderer. That's the thing: perverts have better things to do than a therapy. Why is Berg lying? So you agree with me? You don't think he killed her? No. No, I don't think he did. You're right, I can't let him go on like this. I'm off. I'll be late for my show. I'll give myself a week: either he stops or I drop him. A good transition to talk about you, Dr Rivière. For a psychoanalyst as provocative as you, being published in paperback is really an achievement. You've become a sort of classic, almost a monument. Would you like to know my opening hours? Well done. You did well on TV. But I know you well: I noticed you were a bit nervous. - Really? - Yes. Nervous but handsome. Are patients who want their analyst still frowned upon? It still is, yes. I think that among patients, in my case anyway, the opposite would be more appealing. If you fell in love with me, my marriage with Henri would be seriously compromised. Won't you say anything? I hear you anyway. You think of yourself as... attractive... charming... interesting. To you it's natural that people become attached to their analyst. Which is true. No. It's not that I like you. Although... I don't know. I have no clue. But I know you can't control your feelings. Or the rest. Oh, I forgot to ask you last time: is what you write true? That Freud didn't believe he could be loved at first? And when a patient first declared herself, to avoid all risk, he sent her to another doctor? He hadn't yet discovered transference at the time. Maybe he didn't find himself attractive and wasn't like those who think the world revolves around them. Are you like that? - Hi. - How are you? I heard you were great on TV. - Is your mother here? - She's with a patient. - It's boring. - You eavesdrop? No, I'm just kidding, I have homework to do. Tell me when it's time to leave. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Here's the star. - Hello. I wrote the cheque you asked me for. Do you need that much? My bank is harassing me. I'll pay you back next month, thanks. Why don't you sell your house? No way! Patients keep coming in. I gave myself a year. It's for me. I'm off. Did Simon mention his project? No. What is it? Mum, it's for you. It's that guy again. - Did you tell him I was in? - No. OK, then... - Hello? - Who is it? No. My mother... Someone who insists I take him. - You refused? - After the first meeting. He acted like a tourist. A tubby guy, shaved head, gold-rimmed glasses. A kind of vulgar intellectual. It's the fifth time he calls. What do you do in a case like that? What I do? Don't you know what I do? Look! Wow! See this tapir? Where's the toilet? Down there. Go on, I'll wait. - What were you doing? - It was crowded. - Were you worried? - No, it's OK. Come on. You were right to be scared. There was a strange guy, the type who gives kids sweets. He insisted on giving me a pin. Mr Berg, I'm not interested in anything you just said. I don't think it's funny. I'd like you to explain what you were doing at the Natural History Museum. Oh? Did we see each other there? I'm listening. No, you're not listening. I confess my crime and you tell me about the Museum. You didn't even go to Garches. Maybe I should go and find another analyst. That's a good point. In the meantime, don't think about going to my ex-wife. Word gets around fast. Don't worry, I don't think she's suitable either. Maybe no woman suits me. Well, only Nina, an exception. I needed to find a stand-in. The neighbours needed to hear our argument. And the police couldn't suspect that my wife was dead. So... I roamed the red-light districts. I looked at the girls that vice offers virtue wondering: "Would she look like Laura with the right costume?" In the end I got to a bar in Pigalle where very alert hostesses greet you half-naked. I spotted Nina immediately. The right height, the same oval face. OK! No need for you to keep going. Let's leave it at that. I write the diary of my therapy with you on this computer. All the details, with no exception. Shall I come back for my next session? No. I'll see you Thursday at 11 am. I'll let you know what I've decided. Ask yourself what you want from this therapy in terms of what you did - or what you fantasize about. - OK. I have a bad feeling about what can happen here. Mr Davenne, for instance. It's Monday, but today, you waited for him in vain. I called Mr Davenne but he's still not answering. Thank you. Now go, it's late. - Goodbye, Doctor. - Goodbye, Fabienne. Hello? Hold on, I'll go and see. Is there a Miss Nina here? Hello? Hello? He hung up. How's your inner experience going, Mr Gautier? It's still in progress. My voice is changing. I hardly have any hair left. I have a girl's skin. Last time I told you my breasts were growing. Today, I saw that my hips and buttocks were rounder. In a week, God and I will move on to the second step. - "The second step"? - Yes. Once I've become a real woman, Gabriel will announce me the mystery of Incarnation. And I will become Jesus' mother. Exactly. If I think about it... I wonder what my future is going to end with. "End with"? I meant "lead to". Nice Freudian slip! Not a very hard one to interpret. It's like my clothes. They reflect my thoughts. It's like I'm in semi-mourning. But it suits the black thoughts in my mind. What's on your mind? On my mind? Only mess. I didn't let my dad have a life. He punished himself. I'm not sure leaving him will solve it all. I'm feeling awful. There. End of the session. Lie down again. I won't kill myself. My 2 attempts were so great that I won't kill myself lightly again. I saw my solicitor. To talk about my will this time. Your will? Why? It helped me prepare for my wedding. What do you mean? I don't want to say. There's something about you in that will. Luckily not all your patients are as neurotic as I am. Are they? My dear friends, gathered around the same passion... The love of spring rolls and Peking duck? No, mister, no. A passion for psychiatry, chronic delirium, alcohol-induced encephalopathy, - schizophrenia. - We're eating... And let's announce it: - mixoscopy. - "Mixo" what? You don't know mixoscopy and you're in charge of souls? You must know voyeurism, Didier? Well mixoscopy is the same thing. Of course, as soon as someone mentions a depraved sexual practice, you're over the moon. Ah! The great Krafft-Ebing was right, unfortunately: there's nothing to expect from human beings other than baseness and animality. Did the Latin-Greek Teacher Kill Himself? What's going on? I'm sorry, I... I don't feel well. I don't feel well. I have to go. I'll call you. His mutilated body was on the tracks Oh, good. - I was worried you hadn't got it. - Huh? - Didn't you get my message? - I was out. I came immediately to show you this. He was one of my patients. It's him I talk about in my message. The police found his diary. They called me because... your name's in it and geographically you're under my jurisdiction. Did he have a session yesterday? Yes. And he didn't come. - Didn't you call the police? - Why would I? I only understood just now, when I saw the paper. And when he didn't come yesterday afternoon, - you didn't know he was dead? - How could I? Through the afternoon papers. I don't read them! I made you a copy: "Teacher Dies". Was it suicide? I don't know. Several people in his carriage noticed him, they found him strange. Depressed. - That's why he saw you. - Yes, he didn't feeling great. What do you think? Was it a suicide? An accident? - A murder? - "A murder"? Why? I reckon it was an accident. He was in therapy, he was hanging on! Some revealing blunder, walking out onto railway tracks. He couldn't sleep. He took lots of sleeping pills. I agree! The autopsy just confirmed he had taken loads. So what's this about? You know the police: we tell lies to get the truth. Even to friends? Nice! Especially to friends. Did you give him sleeping pills? No. Ask his GP. He can be another suspect. Did you have a look at the list - I gave you? - Yes. I didn't notice anything. That's a shame. There's a change of plans. We're going to Garches. Am I disturbing? Yes, you're disturbing. Are you surprised? - I'm sincerely sorry... - Don't be. It's natural, when you make love to a woman for the first time to suddenly feel like reading the paper. You know that's not true. I felt ill. So nothing is lost. Buck up, and when you feel better, call me. But for now, Antoine, goodbye. Goodbye. Hello. I think I never missed a session. Did I? Keep going. It's going to be strange missing Saturday. I tried to change it but... Henri... absolutely wanted that time. So... at 11:00, I'll say "yes", and at 11:05... And your gloomy thoughts? They got lighter. Do you know what they look like? Well, I don't feel as if I've chosen my destiny, and I still don't know why I'm getting married. But I imagine that someone up there decided that for me and must have a good reason. my sweet, my love, innocence itself BÉATRICE FONTAINE née EPSTEIN Mrs Lesquin? Yes, it's Antoine. Antoine Rivière. Yes! Back from the dead, indeed. I cant' talk to you now, Mrs Lesquin, but I need to see you urgently. Could I come tomorrow? No, I haven't checked the times yet. I first wanted to know... Thank you. You're wonderful. I'll call you back when I know what time. Why are you late? - Shall I leave? - Come to my office. No, sit down this time. Now, Mr Berg, I want you to answer my questions. One: what really happened to your wife? Two: how did you know Mr Davenne wouldn't come? Great. - I was telling you about Nina... - No! I'm interested in what really happened to your wife. I suffocated her, I'm a murderer. What more can I confess? There's a reason I want to talk about Nina. What reason? Finally! She worked in Pigalle, in a bar. The Jude the Obscure. And she looked like Laura! She lived with a Brazilian guy who wanted to go back to his country. As you're interested in my wife's fate... The day after she died, I arranged for people to see Nina dressed up as Laura, suitcase in hand with the Brazilian guy, conspicuously leaving our house. A few days later, Nina came back under her real name while Laura... officially remained in Brazil with her lover. As for Mr Davenne, either I killed him, or I found out he was dead in the paper. I need to choose. You rang the wrong doorbell. You thought you could play cat and mouse with me, and you were wrong. Psychoanalysis isn't a battle. You told me I wasn't like other analysts. You were right. My neutrality, you see, isn't always benevolent. So I'll shed light once and for all on your wife's story and see whether you should be arrested. For now, your analysis is over. And keep away from my ex-wife or son. When I need to contact you again, I will. You don't have to pay for this session. Jude the Obscure Hello. - Is it your first time? - Yes. I've heard good things. Welcome to Jude the Obscure. Your 1st impression? - It's promising. - Sorry? They're promising. I see! I'm Eddie, I'm in charge of customer relations. Can I invite any girl I want? Yes, any of them. Myriam, for instance. - Hello, Myriam. - Hello. Anne-Sophie, Bérangère, Nina, Josie. Nina then. Why not? Come. Come, Bataille. Come on, doggie. Bataille! So? What are you here for tonight? A conversation. An erotic one? No, just a conversation. Oh, that'll be a nice break. What do you want to talk about? About mountains. Do you know the German word for "mountain"? No. I took English as a first language. It's "Berg". Nina, I don't mean you any harm. My name is Antoine Rivière. I'm a psychoanalyst. Edouard Berg is my patient. I know you know him. He's unwell. He mentioned you. - Me? - Yes. But don't worry. I only need one piece of information: did he ask you to wear another woman's clothes? - His wife's? - Didn't Eddie tell you? We don't talk about what we do outside of here. Nina... Nina, I'm a doctor. I'm not a policeman. You can help me. Berg's wife disappeared a year ago, and I can't... Stop it, I'm not interested. All I know is this: last year, I wore the clothes of a woman I didn't know, walked down the street, and got a plane to Rio. - There was a man with you. - He had nothing to do with it. He stayed in Brazil. I returned to Paris alone. Who was he? A friend of yours? He was Anton, a Brazilian friend. Whe shared a flat. He was saving money to go home, he was fed up with the cold. Mr Berg asked me: "Would he agree to put on an act?" - Did he offer money? - Of course. Ten times what I earn in a month. He had it all planned. The clothes, the glasses, the wig. He wanted me to look like her. Did he tell you where she was? OK, I didn't ask, I didn't want to know. I came back alone, under my real name. I gave him the passport and got my money. Did he ask you not to talk about it? After he paid me... He looked at me in the eyes. We understood each other. No need for words. Thank you, Nina. I don't have any other questions. I'll go. You say he's one of your patients? Yes. Well, I... I just kicked him out. But that's another story. Nice meeting you. Thank you for being so kind. Yeah, "kind". That's just me. Hello? It's Florence. I've been trying to reach you. Bataille just got killed on the street. Simon got home from school and said that a creep talked to him at the school. He's the guy with a shaved head, the one I didn't want as a patient. Simon is petrified. He wanted me to call you. - I can call the police. - No, stay put, I'm coming. I'll be there in 15 minutes. Wait for me. Do you know that man? Are you being blackmailed? No! I don't know him! You're as slippery as an eel these days. He came to see you, not me. He's not an ordinary patient! You're lying to me! Maybe he wants to get back at mum? That's not how it works. Listen... Anyway, I know who to ask. A therapist friend of mine works with the cops on perverts. I'll ask him about it. It's the last time that this guy bothers you. Do you hear me? The last time. Are you staying tonight, dad? Yes. Yes. I'll sleep on the sofa. Let them ask their masters Dogs who want to be fit: that's Royal What was on your mind yesterday, Antoine? I wanted to tell you about someone who had or says he had Dr Meyer as an analyst. Today, this guy seems to be off his rocker. Maybe you remember him? - What's his name? - Berg. Edouard Berg. Berg? Doesn't ring a bell. He was one of Dr Meyer's patients? He came after the accident and asked me to take him on because his analyst had died. No. Berg really doesn't sound familiar. What does he look like? I have a picture. Yes! I know that guy very well! I often opened the door for him. I remember perfectly. But his name wasn't Berg. It was... I can't remember. Could you look at this list? If a name looks familiar... Fontaine! His name was Fontaine. The doctor first saw him at the hospital, and then at home. I'm not surprised he's giving you trouble. The doctor said he found him disgusting. Actually, I remember now that just before he died, Dr Meyer told me he had just got rid of him. I know you're not open yet, but I can't wait, so I'll be direct. - I want a phone number. - Really! Did you notice our name has "obscure" in it? We learn to keep quiet before we learn to breathe. Well take a deep breath, Eddie. I brought you something to defeat the darkness. Is it light enough? It makes no difference. Not at all. This little sum covers the reputation of the place, your professional conscience, my discretion... and the great relationship we'll have. Yes, maybe... Whose phone number do you want? Nina's. I had a drink with her, and I need additional info. - Oh, "additional info"? - Yes. That changes everything. If it isn't for a chat-up, only to ask for "additional info"... I would be mean to barricade her virtue. You've struck it lucky: 1 week-end out of 5, the girls are off. Today, it's Bérangère and Nina. How convenient to get your "additional info"! I'll call her. Do you mind? Hello? Nina? It's Dr Rivière. Do you remember? Yeah. How did you get my number? I'll explain. It's about Berg again. I know he's dangerous now. I need you. - You must talk. - What's going on? It went well last time. What's this about? Give me an appointment anytime at the Jude the Obscure, at your place, anywhere. - Where are you? - At the Jude. I can wait here. No, I'm not working today. Listen... left of the Jude, there's a café called Le Bastia. Have a drink there. I'll call you back. Can I see you today? I'll think about it. Go to Le Bastia, I'll call you. What are you doing here? Rivière is coming. You said... Don't bother. Have you changed your mind? We have a minute. You did ask him to meet you at 12 pm? But he could be early. You'll bump into him. You don't know him. He's pathologically punctual. You said you'd take pictures of the building. Wait. Isn't that a car coming? I ran away. He's a maniac. - What's going on? - Henri. My husband... - He went mad, he beat me. - I don't understand. Come. Come. We were getting married today. I have a call to make. I'll be with you in a minute. Sit down. Hello? Yes, it's Antoine... Sorry to wake you up. Is your dad home? I'll call him there. Bye. Sorry but I have nowhere to go. I wouldn't want my dad to see this. It's fine. I'll take care of you. It's painful to have believed in it, even just a little. I'll just make another call. Why did he do this? He changed all of a sudden. After the ceremony, we spent the day together. Just him and me. It was nice. He was incredibly kind. We had dinner and for the first time, he took me to his house. And then he said: "Isabelle, I'll be back in a minute, I have a surprise." Hello? Yes, hello. I'm a friend of the superintendent's. I'm told he's at the police station. Oh! A long time ago? No, it's OK, I'll call his house. Thank you. - Are you calling the police for me? - Well, yes and no. I have a problem too. 20 minutes later, he came back. He looked really odd. He had shaved his head. He wore gold-rimmed glasses and a red jacket. We went to his office. It was like a therapist's. He made me lie down on the couch. The same as yours. And then he insulted and beat me. What are you talking about? He has a shaved head and gold-rimmed glasses! What's your husband's name? - Well, Henri. - I know, but Henri what? - Henri Fontaine. - I don't believe it! Fontaine! - You're mad as well. - No, I'm OK. I'm OK, but I need to... I need to think this through. It's late, we should... Do you want to stay here tonight? That would be nice. - Thank you. - OK now. Go to sleep. See you tomorrow. I see my homing pigeon got to you. Béatrice. You don't know her. Is she another of your victims? No, my wife. My only wife. You're in her house. The only place where I thought I could be happy. Béatrice drowned in Biarritz. We'd been married 5 years. It killed me. What do you mean? What do I mean? I've been told that I became delirious when she died. I was confined in Dr Meyer's service. That's how I discovered your profession. I can just see it: I was mad with pain, hadn't slept for four days, screaming Béatrice's name: "My sweet, my love!" And him... the good doctor... the perfect clinician... explaining everyone: "He's becoming psychotic." Meyer had the right diagnosis. "Diagnosis", "psychosis"! You're all the same. Ever pain has its label, every symptom has its price. With Meyer, I had to pinch myself to refrain from strangling him. Sit down, you're exhausting me. Why did you kill your second wife? Laura? She was a patient of Meyer's. One of those rich, model patients. I invented Edouard Berg for her. It was all mapped out: Berg would marry Laura, and would become a rich widower. You killed her for her money? No. Not you! Goodbye, Laura, and Meyer too. He couldn't outlive his patient. Why didn't you disappear after these two perfect murders? I got to like it. In 4 months I found a new prey, Isabelle. And tonight... you knew I would come? I knew you wouldn't let a guy like me walk all over you. I really had to needle you. To the point of offering you Nina's murder. "Needle" me, really? Here we are, Dr Rivière: it's the last show. The very last, the ultimate one. We'll end this transference. I'll kill you. Then I'll go and kill Isabelle with your knife. The one on your desk, with your fingerprints on it. For the police, it will be clear: Isabelle was under your thumb. On her wedding day, she couldn't help but go to your house. You... her analyst, had such an influence on her. Sorry, but I had no problem convincing her to bequeath you part of her fortune when she died. Four million francs. She loved you so much. Her murder will set tongues wagging. A guru psychoanalyst who tried to fleece super-rich Isabelle d'Archambaud got mad with jealousy, gave up on the money, killed her and disappeared. Do you like the role? No second thoughts? No second thoughts, no. - Gentlemen. - Dr Rivière? Vésinet police. We need you to come with us. - OK, I'll just put my coat on. - Good. Superintendent Vernon. Sorry to bother you. Please, sit down. Have you been told why you're here? Do you know Mrs Isabelle Fontaine? Yes. - Was she at your house tonight? - Tonight? Could you tell me more before I decide whether I should answer? Mrs Isabelle Fontaine, née d'Archambaud, is in custody here. She told us you were her analyst. She came to see you last night after arguing with her husband. She says he hit her. And you put her up. Is that right? Maybe she dropped by, but I was out. When I got back, she was there, her face broken. What time was it? Why are you interrogating me? Oh, it's not very complicated. At dawn, your patient was found sitting next to the body of her new husband, Mr Fontaine. A bit earlier, she had called us, explaining he had killed himself. In front of her? No, not in front of her. Just before she returned to their house, to talk to him again. It's difficult to understand because... she isn't very coherent. She blames herself for everything... She's a bit deranged, isn't she? - A little fragile, yes. - OK... Deranged, mad... "fragile". - What was she like yesterday? - She was definitely upset. I talked to her, I took care of her. She didn't know where to go. I put her in my son's room. Do you know when she left? No, I only discovered she was gone this morning. I went to bed just after her and slept right through. Dr Rivière, I won't lie to you: Henri Fontaine was murdered. It's obvious that the pistol was put in his hand, even before the autopsy. And as the house wasn't broken into or wrecked, Mrs Fontaine's chances aren't very high, if you know what I mean. You don't seem surprised. - That she killed her husband? - Yes. I don't know. She's a strange woman. She's inscrutable. - Does she know you suspect her? - I wanted to see you to find out if psychologically... Your job is to be discreet. But I can tell you think this woman is capable of the worst. "The worst"? Maybe. You'd be a good analyst. A good cop is always a good analyst. That's enough for now. Thanks. She looks quite frightening like this. Yes, quite. Mrs Fontaine made provisions in her will to bequeath you 4 million francs personally. This money will be given to you as soon as Mr d'Archambaud, father of the deceased, authorizes its delivery and the inheritance tax is levied. Thank you. Will this procedure take long? We'll do our best. I know that Isabelle... admired you greatly. I wonder whether you have an explanation - for her suicide. - No, I don't have one. Killing her husband, whom she loved more than she realized, sort of... destroyed her will to live. Why did she do it so soon? There were no charges against her yet. - Let that secret stay hers. - You're right. I have one last mission. The day before his wedding, Mr Fontaine gave me this. He wanted me to give it to you personally if something happened to Isabelle and he wasn't there to pick it up. I need to watch a video. Don't disturb me. Wait, my niece is using the video recorder. Don't worry, I'll go. I'm sorry, Sabrina, it'll just take a few minutes. Don't stay here. I'll call you when it's finished. Even when you expect it, it's strange to die. Don't look so upset! Everything went as planned. It's ten minutes past nine Friday. Tomorrow, I'm marrying Isabelle. Do you follow me? Tomorrow's the big day. Our last session still hasn't took place. I knew that if I told you about the legacy, you'd sentence Isabelle as surely as I would have. Aren't I right? Freud called it a "successful interpretation". You're fundamentally a bastard. You wanted to analyze me but I showed you who you are. Death awaits me since Béatrice left. What I want is that tomorrow you, Dr Rivière, Freud's descendant, fully explore your wickedness. Meyer was imposed to me, but I chose Rivière. I chose you because you're both respectable and disgusting. You're a murderer in the making. You just need help to mature and finally hatch. Leave me alone, darling. Relax! "Of all serious things, marriage is the silliest." But Freud says you should take second marriages more seriously. - In which article? - Forget it. Antoine knows all the useful quotes. Stop harassing him. - "The taboo of virginity." - What? The Freud quotation is in that article. Now let's have a picture taken for our descendants. Talking about descendants always cools Antoine off. Subtitles: Olivia Cooper-Hadjian for Eclair Media
