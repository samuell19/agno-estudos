(♪♪♪♪♪) (♪♪♪♪♪) (♪♪♪♪♪) (Birds squawking) (♪♪♪♪♪) (Rustling) (Panting) Huh? YAKARI: Got you! (Barks) (Sniffling) (Bird squawks) Ha-ha! (Grunts, laughs) I got you! - (Laughs) - (Barks) Aww, come on Droopy Ear, don't give me that face! Alright, you're turn! (Laughs) (Barks) (Birds chirping) - (Rumbling) - (Whimpers) (Buffaloes mooing) (♪♪♪♪♪) STRAIGHT GAZE: Our brothers, the buffalo know when the season is coming to an end. We have to warn the tribe. (♪♪♪♪♪) (Native American music playing) (♪♪♪♪♪) Hm. (Gasps) Whoa! (Laughing) You got me! - (Horse neighing) - (Gasps) YAKARI: Oh! (♪♪♪♪♪) (Neighs) YAKARI: Oh! That looks just like... Little Thunder! (Gasps) (Grunting) (Barks) YAKARI: Oh! - Did you see him? - (Droopy Ear whimpers) It's Little Thunder, you know? The fastest mustang of them all. All the Sioux know him! I just wish I could get close to him. - RAINBOW: Yakari! - Hmm? BUFFALO SEED: Hey there! - Come shoot some arrows with us. - YAKARI: I can't. (Grunts) It's always the same with Yakari. I guess we'll just go back to the camp, then. You're just scared of losing to a squaw, Buffalo Seed. What? Pah! You don't stand a chance, Rainbow! Well. At least I can practice my aim. (Squawking) - STRAIGHT GAZE: Yakari! - Father! Your mother needs our help at the village. Do you think I'll be able to ride Little Thunder one day? Little Thunder? Oh, no my son. Impossible. Not even our very best hunters, have even managed to catch him. (♪♪♪♪♪) - WOMAN: Put it over here. - SLOW STRIDER: Woah. YAKARI: Whoops! - Woah. Woah! Woah! - Over here. - (Grunts) - Sorry! - Oh. - Oh! Woah! (Yawns) Leave it. I'll take care of it. Oh, I'm sorry, Slow-Strider! (Yakari grunts, pants) - Oh. - (Panting) Thank you, my son. Wow. The tribe is so busy today. Yes, and tonight, come to the foot of the spirit tree. The elders of the tribe have something important to announce. Off you go now. You should get some rest... Oh! (Chuckles) (Yakari laughs) (Droopy Ears barks) (Yakari panting) YAKARI: Wait for me, Droopy Ear. (Grunts) (♪♪♪♪♪) Wow! Oh. RESTFUL ROCK: Careful, Slow Strider! SLOW STRIDER: It doesn't matter. - (Snoring) - (Laughs) (Grunting) Hello, flying squirrel. You didn't really think I'd forget about you, did you? (Squawking) (Sighs) (♪♪♪♪♪) (Horse neighs) (Geese quaking) Yahoo! Oh! Woah! Woah! (Laughs) (♪♪♪♪♪) (Humming) (Screeches) (♪♪♪♪♪) (Screeches) (Yakari screams) Aah! Aah! (Grunts) (Midnight-Braids gasps) Yakari! Are you alright? (Laughs) (Thuds) I had a dream! I was flying! Woosh! I was an eagle! A giant eagle! You know, dreams say a lot about the person who dreams them. He who is visited by the eagle, will have an exceptional destiny. Hmm. An exceptional destiny. (Laughs) - RAINBOW: Yakari! - Huh? So, who won? The wind blew off my aim... (Rainbow laughs) I saw Little Thunder this morning. Really? Little Thunder? (♪♪♪♪♪) (Humming) YAKARI: Sorry, Slow Strider! BUFFALO SEED: Sorry, Slow Strider! RAINBOW: Sorry, Slow Strider! STRAIGHT GAZE: Hurry now, papooses, and stay quiet. Restful-Rock is about to speak. Psst, is he as fast as they say he is? Ah, who? Slow Strider? No! Little Thunder! - Who do you think? - (All shushes) Children! Be quiet! Sorry. Shh! (Laughs) (Grunting, coughs) In their infinite wisdom, the buffalo know when they have to leave the plain. And they have shown us the way. You all know that our tribe cannot survive without the buffalo. And so, the time has come. We too must now leave, and follow their trail. WISE ONE: We must hurry. Tornado season will soon be upon us. These twisters from the sky, destroy everything in their path! - Oh! - Ah! WISE ONE: No human, no animal, can survive a tornado. (Chanting in Native American language) (Grunts, clears throat) Thank you, Wise-One. (Clears throat) Straight-Gaze, are we ready to leave? Yes, but we need more horses for such a long difficult journey. (Grunts) We will round some up tomorrow. (Indistinct chattering) Hey! Let's follow the hunters out tomorrow. - Uh uh. My father won't let us. - Shh! Uh uh! Only braves are allowed to capture mustangs. But I am brave! But braves wear feathers of bravery! (Laughs) Hey, wait! Little Thunder might be with the mustangs. (Grunts) Where is everyone? RAINBOW: Yoohoo! (Screaming) (♪♪♪♪♪) RAINBOW: Woohoo! - BUFFALO SEED: Wait up! - (Droopy Ear barks) (Yakari laughs) (Sioux hunters yelling) SIOUX HUNTER: Woohoo! Keep them together! (Mustangs neighing) (♪♪♪♪♪) Little Thunder? - There he is! - See. I told you he'd be here. Get down, or they'll see us! (Neighing) (Grunts) Eyagh! Oohh! This mustang won't always escape us. (Laughs) Oh. (Neighs) Little Thunder! We better go, before the hunters see us. Oh. You go back without me. - What? - No, Yakari! Soon the tribe will be far away from here. This is my last chance to get close to him. Don't worry. I'll be back before you know it. No, sorry Droopy Ear. You would only scare Little Thunder. Good boy! Go home! (Howling) (Grunts) This time he's really gonna get in trouble. His parents won't be happy. Droopy Ear, follow him. (Gulps) Ah. (Panting) (Little Thunder neighing) Aha! Oh! Woah! (Neighing) What...? Oh! You're stuck! No need to be scared, Little Thunder. You're not hurt? Good. Now listen, I'll do this very gently. It's alright. Don't be scared. Slowly now... (Grunting) Stay calm. (♪♪♪♪♪) (Grunting) (Screams) Can I be your... friend? (♪♪♪♪♪) - (Droopy Ear barks) - Huh? (Laughing) Little Thunder was just here! - And I helped him! - (Barks) Oh! (Laughs) I just wish I could see him again. - (Eagle screeches) - Huh? Woah! (Rumbling) (♪♪♪♪♪) Ohh! You look just like the eagle from my dream! I am Great Eagle. Your totem, your protector. Where you go, I go. Woah! You were generous, in saving Little Thunder. Umm, do you think I could be his friend some day, and he would let me ride on his back, then? For your generosity, this is my most beautiful feather. (♪♪♪♪♪) Woah! Thank you, Great Eagle. It's just like the ones the Sioux braves wear. Umm, does that mean, I'm a brave now? He who lives in peace with all living things and who does well by them, is a brave. In addition to the feather, I now bestow on you a gift that has never belonged to any human before you. YAKARI: Another gift? GREAT EAGLE: Use it well! What other gift? (Great-Eagle screeches) (Yakari screams, grunts) (Gasps) (Laughs) It wasn't a dream this time! ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ho, ha, hey ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ho, ha, hey ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ho, ha, hey ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ho, ha, hey ♪ - (Barking) - Huh? Aww! Look, Droopy Ear! It's the same feather the bravest Sioux wear! Yeah, that's really nice, but can we please go home now? Huh? What? Woah! Yakari! Hey, I understood what you said when you spoke? You're right! So did I! So, then you can understand me telling you: let's go now! Then Great-Eagle's gift is, the power to talk to animals? (Laughs) You know what that means? Huh? Yeah. Yes. We are going back to the village? YAKARI: (Laughs) No! It means I can talk to Little Thunder! Hey! That's not the way back to the village! YAKARI: Little Thunder's tracks stop right here on this stone path. He's probably gone into the forest. DROOPY EAR: (Gulps) You're not going in there! Not with all those wild beasts inside! YAKARI: I have to talk to him! You talk "dog" but maybe you don't talk "horse" at all! (Distinct animal noises) YAKARI: There aren't any tracks. Maybe if we meet some other animals, I can ask them. And then at least we could see if I really can speak to animals. Animals? What other animals? Yakari? (Whimpering, sniffing) Where are you? Yakari? Pst! - Never do that to me again! - Shh! Huh? BIRD 1: Did you see that little human? What's he doing all alone in the forest? BIRD 2: And that dog. Well, he doesn't look anywhere near brave enough - to protect him! - (Giggling) Hey birds! I understand you. - What? - What? Have you seen a mustang pass...? Ha! This is got off to a good start! (Elk growls) (♪♪♪♪♪) (Snoring) Aah! Hello, owl! (Screams) OWL: Ow! Ah, I'm sorry. Can you understand me? Have you seen a horse pass by? You! You can't just sneak up and start talking! Bla, bla, bla! Oh! Hey! You are talking my language! Mm-hmm. (Laughs) I'm Yakari. And I can understand! What a rude little man you are, scaring me like that! Oh and by the way, your horse went that way! Oh. Thank you, owl! And, sorry. (♪♪♪♪♪) - Oh! - (Barks) (Laughs) Hey, little butterfly. You understand me, don't you? - Yes. - (Gasps) Did you see a mustang pass by? - Yes yes yes! - Bilibilibilibli. (Laughs) Hey! Not all at once! BUTTERFLY: Over here! Follow us! YAKARI: Hmm. Oh, hey look! Thank you, butterflies! Please... Please tell me you're not planning to talk to the ants. (Laughs) My father taught me how to follow a trail. This is Little Thunder's trail. Not again with that horse! We have to get back! It's different now. Thanks to Great Eagle's gift, I'll be able to talk to him. I can be his friend! But you have a friend! YAKARI: Hang on, Droopy Ear. Let's go! (Birds squawking) Aha! Ohh! Wait for me here. I'll bet there are lots of wild animals hiding around here. Umm... Don't be scared. Umm, my name is Yakari. I... I can understand you! (Laughs) Yes! It's a gift from Great Eagle, my totem. Now, I can talk to all the animals! At least, I think so, Little Thunder. Wait. What does 'Little Thunder' mean? (Laughs) It's you! It's the name my people, the Sioux, gave you: Little Thunder, the mustang who runs as fast as lightning! What are they doing? Umm, how's your hoof? Does it hurt? Umm... No, it's... it's fine. Thank you, for saving me back there. (♪♪♪♪♪) (Yells, grunts) - Hey! - Huh? What're you doing? I... well, I thought we were friends. And that I could... You can talk to animals now, can't you? So next time, ask first! Little Thunder! Oh no! Wait! You may have a gift, Yakari, but you're like all the other humans. Like them, you're selfish! Oh, no. Wait! Little Thunder! Wait! (Neighs) YAKARI: No! Little Thunder! (Barking) (♪♪♪♪♪) (Grunts) Aah! Oh, no! Yakari! Yakari! YAKARI: (Screams) Woah! (♪♪♪♪♪) Aah! Oh! (Grunts) (♪♪♪♪♪) (Screams) (Screaming) (Howling) Oh, no! Go! Get the humans! (♪♪♪♪♪) Woah, woah! Calm down. Calm down. (Neighing) BUFFALO SEED: We told him not to go. Yes, but he wouldn't listen. Yakari has never gone so far before. And never alone. I sent Droopy Ear, but he hasn't come back yet. It's all my fault. It was my idea to go see the horses. This is not your fault, papooses. We'll go search for our son, Midnight Braids. But first, I must speak to the tribe. Thank you both for your help. - Shh! - (Gasps) Uh...? Oh! (♪♪♪♪♪) Oh... (♪♪♪♪♪) Hey, what're you doing, Rainbow? Shh! Straight Gaze is saying he's going in search of his son. The elders understand, but say the tribe can't wait for them to come back. What? We can't leave without Yakari. (Shrieks) Oh, the tribe must leave as soon as it can. The tornadoes are dangerous. We have to leave the area. Buffalo Seed and I would like to go with you to find Yakari. Yeah! Huh... what? No, papooses. The tribe will need your help with the move. And following Yakari's trail could be dangerous. Yeah. Yeah! Just like he said. (♪♪♪♪♪) (Sighs) (Sniffs) Linden! Back to work! - Linden! - (Gasps) MANY MOUTHS: Oh, not again! (♪♪♪♪♪) (Yawns) (Snoring) Ow! Hey! Oh, my! How wonderful, Double Tooth. - Yeah? - What're you gonna call it? - "Portrait Of An Old Toad"? - (Growls) Everyone to the dam! Now! Oh! This is a catastrophe, and it will take forever before we have a work in dam again. Look! Ohh? What're you waiting for! Alright, alright, alright! Calm down, Many-Mouths. Our first job is to take care of... - ...that. - (All gasps) We'll have to be careful! It's a human! I didn't know they grew on trees. YAKARI: Hello, beavers. Could... could you help me out of here please? - (All shrieks) - (laughs) And to top it all, he speaks beaver! Hello! I'm Linden. - I'm Yakari. - Oh! (Chuckles) (♪♪♪♪♪) (Barking) Droopy Ear, lead the way! YAKARI: I remember holding on to a tree, and then, I was falling down - the waterfall. - LINDEN: Oh. YAKARI: I just don't know how long I was in the water and then, the river brought me to you. (Beavers gasps) Hmm. See that up there? That's Eagle Claw Ridge. It seems so much bigger from the village. My parents are so far away from here. Oh! Humans have parents too? Oh no! I've lost my feather. My parents and my friends must be really worried. And, my dad was right. No-one can catch Little Thunder. I just wanted to be friends with that horse. Friends? But you have a friend. Me! (Laughing) Thank you, Linden. But... I have to go home. Bye, beavers. - So long. - Bye! Bye! Yippee! Yippee! (Laughs) Are we there yet? (♪♪♪♪♪) (inhales) See ya, Linden. (Crying) Goodbye, Yakari. Ah, no matter. We'll meet again! (Laughing) MANY MOUTHS: Linden! Get to work! On my way! (Laughs) Linden, what're you doing? If I walk like this, by the time I get to the dam, all the work'll be done. And from afar, it looks like I'm... MANY MOUTHS: LINDEN! Bye! (Breathing heavily) (♪♪♪♪♪) - (Great Eagle screeches) - Huh? Oh! Great Eagle! Do not be discouraged, Yakari, I will never leave you. But, I don't deserve your trust. I've lost the feather. I'm not a brave. You still have a long way ahead of you. Huh? Once you have faced Giants and Mother Earth's anger only then will you know if you are a brave. Believe in yourself! Great Eagle! Giants? Mother Earth's anger? What did Great Eagle mean? Huh? (Rumbling) My tribe! Father! Mother! I'm here! Over here! Huh? (Gasps) Oh no! (Screams) (Mustangs neighing) (Grunts) LITTLE THUNDER: Yakari! Are you alright? YAKARI: Little Thunder! Quick! Hop on my back! (♪♪♪♪♪) I'm riding Little Thunder! Wahoo! Quiet! You'll put us all in danger! There are hunters behind us! - Yah! - Hahh! (♪♪♪♪♪) (Laughs) You saved my life! You're so far from home. - Alone. - But... You should never have left your people, Yakari. Umm... You are so young. But, you were worried about me? That's why you came all the way here! Ehh... Ahh, yes. Now return to your tribe. And stay out of danger from now on! So, then, you can't take me back to my tribe? You can't be my friend? No, Yakari, a free horse can't live with humans. Oh. (Hunters giving commands) Hey! Enough of your games! You're scaring the horses. (Laughs) (Grunts) We can't let them get away with this! Yet again, hunters from your tribe captured horses this morning. Umm, it's true. But they never hurt them. (Sighs) - (horse neighs in distance) - Huh? Stop moving! Stupid animal! (Grunts) - Humans! - Let's free the mustangs! You can gallop faster than those Cougar Skin horses. Lure them into the valley, and I'll free the mustangs! Alright. But be careful this time. I won't be there to help you, if things don't go according to plan. Okay, okay. I know just what to do. It'll be like playing hide and seek with Droopy Ear. Huh? Hmm. (♪♪♪♪♪) Oh! Ah! That one is mine! You! Guard the mustangs. Me? - Think you can handle that? - Yay! Mmm. (♪♪♪♪♪) Huh? Shh! Don't be scared. He he he, he sure is giving you a run for it. (Laughter) Shh! Off you go now. Quietly! Ha, ha, ha! You can go too. I mean, if you want to? I am not used to humans treating me with kindness. I won't forget you, little man. (Laughter) (♪♪♪♪♪) - Haah! - Haah! Woah! - Whoah. - (Horse grunts) That is a horse of great worth! (Grunts) FEARLESS COUGAR: (Laughs) What Great hunters? But not "great" enough to catch a little, tiny, mustang! COUGAR CHIEF: What're you doing here? You were supposed to stay near the horses! (Gasps) You fool! (Grunts) Someone's crawling. And the tracks... lead to those rocks. (Grunts) - (Gasps) - (Grunts) Are you the one who let my horses go? A little papoose? Just you? (Grunts) You! The Sioux! Have no business in our territory! - Huh? - (Gasps) (Screams) LITTLE THUNDER: Yakari, get on my back! (Groaning) Huh? You were tricked by a little Sioux, no bigger than a beaver! After them! No! Our horses are no match for that mustang. (♪♪♪♪♪) (Laughs) They're not following us! We freed the horses! ♪ Hi, hey, hey, hey, hey, ho, ha, hey... ♪ Yes Yakari, and you were very brave. But now they're blocking our way out of here. Hmm... What if we went by way of the mountain? Sioux territory is just on the other side. Nuh-uh. From here you don't realize just how high those peaks are. It would be a long, cold trip. For both of us! Do you really think you're brave enough to take on that mountain? Umm... Hm... Well, Great Eagle told me that, once I faced the Giants, and Mother Earth's anger, I'll know I'm a brave. By Giants, he must've meant... the mountains! Now, I'm sure. This is the way home! You really are determined. Do you want to, er, come with me, Little Thunder? Ah, I can't let you go alone. We have no other choice. Let's face the Giants! Yes! Let's face the Giants. It's your fault we don't have a single horse to take back! (Gulps) That idiot even lost his own horse. - (Grunts) - (Thumps) I know these mountains. And, I will catch that horse! Hm... (Laughing) If I don't, I will never come back to this tribe again! Huh! (Laughs) Well then, I guess this is goodbye. - Go! - (Shrieks) (♪♪♪♪♪) - (Chuckles) - (Growls) A papoose and a horse cannot survive in these mountains. They will have to come down here... (Laughs) ...we will be waiting. (♪♪♪♪♪) (♪♪♪♪♪) (Barks) STRAIGHT GAZE: Hmm. Yakari is following a horse. Our son is taking pointless risks. He'll never ride Little Thunder. (Gasps) Yakari's footprints lead to the river. (♪♪♪♪♪) No trace of Yakari on this side! Only Little Thunder. Oh. - (Droopy Ear barking) - Oh. Yesterday the eagle came to Yakari in a dream. This eagle feather is a sign. Our son is alive, Straight Gaze! There is little time before the tornadoes devastate the plain. And this valley is... The territory of the ruthless Cougar Skins, our enemies. We have to hurry to find our son. ♪ High above, oh-oh ♪ ♪ Oh-oh ♪ - ♪ Oh-oh ♪ - (Grunting) ♪ Way beyond these endless plains ♪ ♪ Beyond the high highest birds can fly ♪ ♪ So high ♪ ♪ Through friends, oho-ho-ho ♪ ♪ On their way through the mountains high ♪ ♪ High above like Giants in the sky ♪ ♪ So high ♪ (Cawing) Oh, this must be bear territory. Careful, Yakari! - (Growling) - (Gasps) Huh! Hey, hello there, Little Cub! Aww. Maybe I can't speak bear. Oh. Are you okay, Little Cub? Umm... were you scared when I growled back there? Are you kidding? I've never been so scared in my life! - Right, Little Thunder? - Come on, we have to go! (Growling) - Come on, move. - It was only a little bear. Let's get out of here. Where there's a bear cub, there's a mother bear. (Growling, laughs) Congratulations, Honeycomb. You're off to a good start! Scaring a little man like that! - (Mama bear humming) - (Honey Comb giggling) (Laughing) (Yakari grunts) Huh! Ah! (Birds chirping) (Tiny Wings laughing) Hey. Hello there, thrush! (♪♪♪♪♪) Heh. Too easy. (♪♪♪♪♪) (Growling) (Laughing) Aah! (Grunts) See! I'm really scary! Oh, yes! Well done, Honeycomb. (Gasps) (Birds squawking) Yakari! Yakari! Are you alright? "Are you alright", poor little thing. I'm fine. I was just collecting berries with my friend here. Then three nasty crows attacked me. - Uh-huh. - But Yakari made them go. Yakari! You're always getting into trouble! Stay close to me from now on. Oh, you two seem so close. - Yes! - Oh, no! (Laughing) Have it your way. They call me Tiny Feathers. Because of my, you know, huge feathers. (Laughing) Hm... (♪♪♪♪♪) What's wrong, Yakari? Tornado season is coming, my tribe is in danger, and I... I can't make it home in time. If only I had wings like Great Eagle, I could fly back home to the Sioux village. I could fly there for you. Really? Would you really do that, Tiny Feathers? Ohh. But you're so small. How could you make it that far? You don't know what we birds are capable of, Yakari. I come from a family, of world travelers. Okay. You go up the river, when you see a dog with brown fur, and a Droopy Ear. He must be looking everywhere for me. Tell him I'm fine. I'm going through the mountains. They don't need to worry. Hey, did you get all that, Tiny Feathers? Sure! I go up the river, I see a brown dog with a Droopy Ear. He must be looking everywhere for you. You are going to the mountains. They don't need to worry. (Both laughs) I guess this is goodbye, my friends! Wahoo-hoo! Hey, that's the wrong way! Just kidding! Ha, ha! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye Tiny Feathers! Thank you! LITTLE THUNDER: Goodbye. Be careful! (Squawking, whistling) That little man isn't here anymore to protect you! Uh oh! (Cawing) I gave Yakari my word! (♪♪♪♪♪) Uh-oh. Get you! Ooh. Really very brave and tiny little bird. - Ow! - (Laughs) (♪♪♪♪♪) Oh, poor Yakari. All alone, not a single grown-up to protect him. Sleep, my little one. I should've gone with him! MANY MOUTH: Pipe down! There are beavers workin' tomorrow. Tch! Yakari is lucky. Alone, without grown-ups. - (Yakari shivering) - (Wind howling) Go on, Yakari. Climb up on my back. You're just as tired as I am, and... I can walk, you know? (Shivers) (♪♪♪♪♪) (Wolves howling) It's even colder at night. (♪♪♪♪♪) Maybe we can shelter there. Don't be scared, little creature. Can we come in? (Squeaking) Huh? Ahh, it's warm here. (Yawns) Do you think we can make it home by tomorrow? We really need to rest first. Hey! He, he, he! Oh! My name is Yakari, and this is Little Thunder. I know that. I followed you from the mountain. I'm Ringtail. I've never seen an animal like you before. Of course you haven't. I'm not from around here. But, it was too hot back at home. I needed some fresh air, and I wanted to see the world! Shh. Snow! You know, I've never seen the snow. Do you know where I can find it, Yakari? You can't find the snow, Ringtail. It finds you. Oh, really! Oh! Sorry. Oh, I forgot. I hunt at night, so see you tomorrow. (♪♪♪♪♪) (Thunder rumbling) Shh! Let's go! BUFFALO SEED: Ow! (Grunts) - This wasn't my idea! - Shh! You'll alert the tribe! What's gotten into you! Dragging me out in the middle of the night! We have to find Yakari, he needs us! - No, papooses! - (Shrieks) It's the tribe that needs you. We must set out before dawn. The tornadoes may come tomorrow. But Restful Rock, Yakari is... Don't worry. His parents are on his trail. I told you so, Rainbow. Hmm... Straight Gaze, Midnight Braids... find your son quickly, and take cover. Tomorrow will be terrible. (♪♪♪♪♪) (Thunder rumbling) (Birds chirping) (Grunts) (Humming) Oh! (Laughing) (Munching) Thank you, Ringtail. For all these delicious things! Oh, sorry. Goodbye, Yakari. I have to sleep. LITTLE THUNDER: Yakari! Come and see! Goodbye Ringtail. See you again soon. Oh! Raingtail's gonna have a big surprise when he wakes up. (♪♪♪♪♪) I never Could have faced these Giants without you. You were very brave, Yakari. And you can climb on back, whenever you want. - (Laughs) - But there's one condition. That I ask permission first? I promise! I promise! Hey, what would you say to a race? First one to the pine trees? YAKARI: First one to the pine trees! Woo! Hey, come on. It's the start of a beautiful day. Woohoo! Ah! Hmm. Huh? What is this stuff? This wasn't here yesterday! Blech! It's soft, and cold! What's it good for? (♪♪♪♪♪) Now I get it. This is snow! (Grunts) (Yakari screaming) (Grunting) - (Laughs) - (Fearless Cougar laughs) And where do you think you're going with my horse? Get out of our way! (Scoffs) I'm not here for you, papoose! Go pick on somebody your own size! Little Thunder is my friend. And I won't let anyone hurt him! Huh! (Growls) (Screams) (Screams) Yakari! Yakari! LITTLE THUNDER: Yakari! Oh no! Leave it to me! Yahoo! Yakari! Yakari! Yakari! Yakari! Yakari! (Grunting) Boy oh boy! Come on. Wake up! (Grunting) Aha! Yakari! Ringtail? But, where's Little Thunder? Little Thunder's okay. He's waiting outside. Oh, thank you. Woah! But... Where am I! Oh, yeah. Okay. It's great! But we need to get out of here. The Cougar... - He isn't that far away! - Cougar? Oh! That's not a Cougar. That's a man. What? Even worse! (Both screams) RINGTAIL: This way! This way! (Grunts) Yakari! Yakari! I know this mountain! You'll only get out of here, if you... if you help me capture that horse! Never! Ooh! Woops! FEARLESS COUGAR: Come on! Be a nice little Sioux! Tell me where the horse is and I'll take you back to your tribe! I'll be your friend! You're not my friend, and you never will be! (Growls) Enough games! He, he he he! Oh no! (Grunting) Hey, you should look where you're going. You should look where you're going! (Thumping) (Growls) Look! A frozen river! I guess it will lead us outside. Come with me to the plain. It's safer there. Oh, no no no no. You can go now. The Cougar is too stupid to catch a Ringtail like me. (Scoffs) And you know, I'll stay in the mountains to enjoy the snow. Wait! Ringtail! Hmm... I'll never forget you. (Gulps) (Screaming) (♪♪♪♪♪) (Breathing heavily) Little Thunder? I'm sorry, Great Eagle. I failed you. But I'm... too weak to go on. Little Thunder? Is that you? Enough of the papoose games! It's your fault the mustang ran away, papoose! (Grunts) STRAIGHT GAZE: Enough! Don't touch my son! - Father! - My son! - Are you alright? - More and more Sioux! Father! Yakari! Come, my son! Mother! We were so worried. Go back! To Cougar Skin territory! - (Barking) - (Whimpering) Yakari, it's time for you to go back to your own people. Hey! Droopy Ear! (Laughs) Thank you for bringing my parents to me. It was your friend, the bird, who told me where to find you. Now, let's go! Winds such as this, brings a tornado. We need to return to the tribe! Now! Oh! Little Thunder. Little Thunder! Little Thunder... We must go, Yakari. - He was here... - We left the tribe to find you! Little Thunder cannot be tamed. He is no man's friend. Look! (Rumbling) Follow the animals. They know where to hide. (♪♪♪♪♪) "Mother Earth's Anger"! Great Eagle meant the tornado! Our horses are exhausted! It will take a miracle! Huh? Oh! (Laughs) Come on! Get on my back, Yakari!
