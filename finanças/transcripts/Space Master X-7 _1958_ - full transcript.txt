The purpose of the film you are about to see, it will tell you what you must know on order to survive. For your safety, it is important that you believe only the truth, and that's what you're about to see. As you know, your government and that of government Soviet Russia have been sending satellites into outer space to observe conditions that human explorers are liable to encounter when are out there. As part of our program, the satellite Spacemaster was put into orbit a thousand miles above the Earth some months ago. Its official designation was X-M712. It carried recording devices, radio transmitters, cameras and the usual non-human passengers. It differed in one respect from other satellites launched during the past year. Provisions were made for bringing it back from outer space intact. It was successfully placed into orbit at 0700 in the morning of December 4, as scheduled. Moon watch stations, radar scopes, any instruments kept track of it, observing it night and day as it hurtled on comet light 1,000 miles up through outer space. These are the men who put the Spacemaster into orbit and brought it back to Earth intact. Among them were scientists and engineers from many of the great universities in the country. Also present on the morning I speak of were John Hand, assigned to the security duty of this office, an Army orderly named Rattigan and Dr. Charles T. Pommer, formerly of Johns Hopkins, was a biologist, attached to the project. 50,000 feet, Dr. Pommer. It's re-entered safely. Good. Then I have my sample from outer space. Looks like Pommer get what he was after. Now he'll have a chance to prove there's life in outer space. Sure, little green men and flying saucers. You're wrong, Mr. Hand. Not little green men. Tell me, do you find this planet so lonely that you have to look at the stars for company? I put the chance that we'll find any creatures in the universe that resemble us in any way at a billion to one. Oh, I'm convinced there's life out there... but in a form so strange as to be beyond anything you can imagine. 30000 feet! This is Hand, security. The 712 is coming down. Let me know as soon as you get a fix on this landing. Right. I'll hold here. Triangulation by radar have pinpointed the exact spot on the desert floor where the satellite impacted, and troops were sent to recover the remains of the space vehicle and the equipment it carried. One such piece of equipment is a special canister designed by Dr. Charles Pommer for the purpose of bringing back samples of microscopic life from outer space. He was given permission to work on the contents of this canister in his own laboratory. Private Rattigan was assigned to drive him there. Thank you Rattigan. Doctor Pommer, I would sure like to see your lab. Oh, very well. Come along. Thank you! Oh, Rattigan, not tonight. What? I want to get right to work. Yes sir. So, you've come back, huh? - Yes, but I'm not going to stay. - No? No and I don't want anyone to know I came here. Well, I've always kept your little secrets, haven't I? Oh, the torch is out, huh? Completely. I've been a selfish man, I'm sorry. - Who is he? - My husband. Oh, congratulations. Well, we have to drink to the man who made an honest woman of you. Charles, I-- Well, make some Martinis, you know how I like it. You haven't changed a bit, have you? Why should I change? I suppose he's the reason you're here. You don't suppose at all. You know he's the reason. Where is he? Boarding School. House without a woman is no place for a boy. Neither is a Boarding School. I can take care of him now. I want him. Bring your husband around sometime. We'll talk them. I can't do that. You mean you haven't told him about us? No, and I'm not going to. And what he going to think if you come home with the boy? People adopt children. We better get the night some thought. Please, Charles. With a dusting, you'll find the spare bedroom habitable. I wouldn't stay here under any circumstances. Oh, come on, Laura, you weren't always so puritanic. What I said we give the Madison thought. My husband doesn't know I'm here. He thinks I'm at home waiting for him. - Where is home? - Hawaii. - And where is he? -He is on a business trip. Well then, you see? We have plenty of time to talk. Charles! Laura, I'm in the middle of an experiment. You know me well enough to know what that means. We don't have a lot of time. I've got to get home before he does. That's your concern, not mine. Well, I'm not going to stay here. It is a fact well known to all astronomers that a reddish rust or blight seems to cover the planet Mars during regular seasons. I therefore came to the conclusion that that stuff a highly destructive fungus ...reproducing itself by microscopic spores. Its spores may incubate and set up new growth in less than a minute under ideal conditions or in a matter of weeks under less favorable conditions. These microscopic spores maybe be carried unwittingly by any person who has contact with the organism either on his clothing or his skin. Because of its color I called this organism Blood Rust. 2:32 pm Wednesday 12th, feeding cultures again. This is the twentieth time since their incubation. As the specimens grow, their need for nourishment also increases. The specimens tolerate only protein in their diet. They might be called carnivorous in fact. You have to talk to me. I can't stay here much longer. I told you not to bother me. Why are you doing this? Why can't you be more human? Will you please get out and leave me alone? I'll talk to you later! No! Yes, what is it? Doctor, this is Hand. I'm checking to find out how your experiment is coming. My experiment is coming fine. It's successful. There is life in outer space. May I come up? No you may not. I'll call you when I'm ready for you. How arrogant. I know what you mean. I sure got the brush last night. He's on to something alright. When he is ready to talk about it. He said there is life in outer space. Hey, that is terrific news. He's probably confirmed his theory. Developed the spores and some parasitic plant life. Boy, what I would give to be working with him. Wait a minute. Sit down. Yes? How do you know so much about him? Oh, I met him when I was going to the college. I attended all his lectures. Then, later I was working for my master's degree, I was his assistant for a while. A master's degree, huh? Yes sir. And now you're driving a jeep, hum? Well, it's a lot better than baking bread. Because that's what they had me doing when I was first drafted. You know, I was on my way to being a pretty good cook too. A little too fancy for the army perhaps, but imaginative. Anyway, somebody thought I had a master's degree, so they transferred me over this after. You know Pommer so well. Why didn't he do something for you? He will, When he gets around to it. He is a strange man. Sharp as a razor and just as about as narrow. He's got of streak of cruelty enemy.??? If you don't mind, sir, when you drive out there, I... I'd sure like to go along. The pleasure is all yours. Thank you sir. Interconnecting neurons throughout the mass supply the motor impulses that conducts all of its functions. These apparently originate in the nearest ganglion. A remarkable feature of this organism is that every ganglion... A remarkable characteristic of this organism is that... ...is that each individual ganglion connects with every other one. In fact, this is a huge and highly developed brain. At the slightest disturbance, each ganglion is capable of shootting out countless tiny spores. These invisible spores, I am convinced, will settle on any living thing that dares to approach it and, after a period of incubation, will proceed to devour it. Will you please go away? Not until we get this settled. All right, wait in there. Now, what's so important? I want my son. Please let me have him. What about your husband? Will he be a good father? Of course he will! He is a wonderful man. Wonderful?! If he's so wonderful, why are you afraid to tell him about us? Because he's jealous. He is so jealous he'd leave me if he knew. I can't risk that. I've got love and I've got security. Things I've never had before. Well, if you have all that, why do you want the boy for? He is my son! Mine too! But what are you doing for him? You don't give him love! You keep him in a boarding school! All right. All right. You can have him. You see? I'm not as heartless as you think I am. I wrote a letter to the school telling to send him to you at midterm. I said that you were the... sister of my dead wife. Laura, you are a beautiful thing and haven't changed a bit. Leave me! Things don't have to change between us. Please. If you touch me again, I'll kill you! I think you would do that. All right. This is what you came for. Here, take it and get out. The primary stages of culture B have started with the same degree of inactivity, which with the additional protein induction, should begin to accelerate. I'm going. However, the... Goodbye. I'm sorry I hit you. It doesn't matter. Goodbye. However, the... However... This is for forgetting you ever saw me. Saw who? I'm all by myself. Thanks. It's 2 am, let's call it a night. Yes, sir. Hand speaking. Who is it? Speak up! This place must be completely destroyed... Burn every stick of it. Burn it to the ground. Pommer! Joe... Pommer... Joe! We got to get that tape. Wait, wait! The window! In this first outbreak of the Blood Rust, even the Jeep used by Rattigan and Hand was destroyed. Because of the potential importance of Dr. Pommer's tape recording, it was thoroughly decontaminated by immersion and fumigation. Hand and Rattigan themselves went through a most rigorous decontamination routine. Complete immersion in a phenol solution followed by thorough scrubbing according to surgical procedures. By the time Hand and Rattigan completed them decontamination, a vast concerted effort was underway to prevent the spread of Blood Rust. The Army, the FBI, and New Mexico State Police sent representatives to confer with John Hand. We carried out a total decontamination for 50 yards in every direction from the place where 712 was recovered. Good. We didn't depend on the fire that destroyed Dr. Pommer's laboratory. We completed the decontamination there too. Then we may be all right, providing that Pommer hasn't had no human contact. Did you check on him? Well, he lived in an isolated area. As far as we can tell, he had not. I hope not. One human contact, one unwitting person who spreads this thing, can carry the contagion all over the country, all over the world. Put on an alarm, make an appeal to any one who-- No. Panic is the danger. Can you imagine the hysteria that news of this thing would create? The tape is ready, sir. Go ahead, Rattigan. Because of its color I called the organism Blood Rust. 2:32 pm Wednesday 12th, feeding cultures again. This is the twentieth time since their incubation. As the specimens grow, their need for nourishment also increases. The specimens tolerate only protein in their diet. and might be called carnivorous in fact. You have to talk to me. I can't stay here much longer. I told you not to bother me. Why are you doing this? Why can't you be more human? Will you please get out and leave me alone? - Get back to the woman's voice. - Yes, sir. ...their diet, and might be called carnivorous in fact. You have to talk to me. I can't stay here much longer. I told you not to bother me. Why are you doing this? Why can't you be more human? Will you please get out and leave me alone? I'll talk to you later! No She was there on the afternoon of the 12th. We broke in to his house at night. She may have been there for several hours. I have an idea she was there a lot longer than that, Sir. The night I drove Dr. Pommer home was the 11th. As we drove up by, I asked the doctor if I can see his lab, he said "Sure, come in." Then he noticed something in the house. He changed his mind. He gave me quick brush just like that. Obviously he knew her well. Pommer has never had anything to do with women. No time for it. Just once, he found time. Colonel, may I suggest you release the story to the press that Pommer's death was accidental? I agree with you that panic is the real danger. But, we must make every effort to find that woman. It was a discouraging search. John Hand had only two bits of information to go on. The woman's voice told him that she was young and the remote location of Dr. Pommer's house made it probable that she had gone to it by taxi cab. Is your name Retlinger? Yes! You were on duty yesterday. Yes that's right. You know Dr. Pommer's house on Las Cruces Road? No! Did he pick up a fair young woman somewhere in that direction? No, sir. You better be pretty sure about that, Mr. Retlinger. We are rounding up anyone who came in contact with that woman for emergency treatment. I'm sure. Hey mister, wait a minute! What's the matter with the lady? Just tell us where you picked her up. Atomic radiation, huh? Something like that? Where did you pick her up? It couldn't hurt a guy sitting up front, could it? It could kill you. Kill me? You mean it?! All right. So, I picked her up. On that place on Las Cruces Road. She gave me 20 bucks to keep my mouth shut. Where did he take her? To the station. She took El Camino west bound. Checked her suitcase through to LA. LA! I'm afraid you will have to come with us, Mr. Retlinger. Wait a minute. Where to? Decontamination. Decontamination?! John Hand gave orders to keep everyone away from Retlinger's cab until it could be taken away and burned. On the way to decontamination, Hand got a complete description of the woman and her luggage from the frightened cab driver. Using the two-way radio in the Jeep, Hand requested the Army to provide a jet bomber to take him and Rattigan to Los Angeles. The jet Hand requested was warmed up and waiting when Hand and Rattigan reached the airport. They took off for Los Angeles almost the same moment that Laura Greeling's train was arriving there. Your attention please. Will passengers arriving on the El Camino on train number 21 they will have to undergo baggage control at the designated counter. When she went to the baggage counter to claim her baggage, she was told by the clerk she would have to wait a few moments. Dr. Pommer, noted Scientist, dies in fire. Mystery Woman Sought That was when Laura Greeling started running in blind panic. She thought she was being sought for questioning in a murder case. She was supposed to be in Honolulu waiting for her husband to come home. Instead, she was 2,000 miles away, and liable to be involved in a scandal at any moment. Switchboard Operator, I'd like to make a collect call to Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands. 1-4-1-1-7. Your name and number, please. This Mrs. Greeling, Lorraine 6-9-4-1-8. Thank you. I have a collect call from Mrs. Greeling. - Will you accept the charge? - Yes. Hello? Jody, this is Laura. Laura, where are you? In Los Angeles. Has Bill come home yet? No, he called yesterday afternoon from Maui. He said he would be home Sunday. Sunday... I've got to get a plane out here tonight. If I can't, I'll call you. Don't worry. I'm staying close if he calls again. Thanks, Honey, bye. Bye. Trans Orient Airways. Reservations, Please. Thank you, one moment. Thank you. This is a repeat of an earlier "APP". All units are asked to be on a lockout for a young woman. She is described as five feet four inches tall, blue eyes, blonde hair, about 27 years of age. last seen she was wearing a brown suede coat. A Los Angeles Police Department helicopter brought Hand and Rattigan to an isolated side track in the Los Angeles freight yard, just 70 minutes after Laura Greeling's train pulled in. - Mr. Hand? - Yes. I'm Deputy Chief Ryder, the man you were talking to from the jet. How do you do? Any luck finding the woman? Nobody answering her description showed up at the baggage counter. We've gotten all parts putting all on her. Everything all set? - All ready for you. - Fine. - Mr. Hand, Battalion Chief Hendry. - Pleasure. - This is Mr Rattigan. - How are you Sir. - Who gets the suit? - I do. Are you sure you don't want one of our men with the boy? No. Rattigan knows exactly what to look for. Okay, let's dress him. We've set up an emergency decontamination facility in that shed over there. When did the conductor first notice the Blood Rust in the baggage car? About 3 am in the Mojave Desert, just outside Barstow. Good thing he had the sense enough to lock the door and stay out. The express man is still in there... or what's left of it. Good luck, Joe. Cab driver Retlinger had described the woman's suitcase in detail. It was of distinctive, light-weight material, further identifiable by Japanese steamship stickers. Hand was confident that the suitcase would provide information of value. If he's not out in three minutes, we'll send someone after him. Send him in. Go ahead. All through with the baggage car? All through. Okay, burn it. The suitcase was immersed in a powerful antiseptic solution until its contents were totally saturated. Then it was opened in the hope of finding clues to the missing woman's identity. A size 10 dress, from Marshall Field in Chicago. A jacket from "Monique" in Paris. Slacks from... the Aloha shop in Honolulu. Well, we've started out with just a voice then we get a pretty fair description. Now we know that she wears size 10 dress and buys her clothes all the way from Paris to Honolulu. Really narrow it down, huh? Hey! Trans Orient Airways, flight 70, check it! Yes, sir. Give me Trans-Orient Airways. Operations. I would like some information. Flight number 70. Destination? Thank you. I see, thank you. Flight number 70 is a Honolulu to Los Angeles running. Arrives on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays at 9pm. That cabbie Retlinger they flew him in for us. They're taking him directly to identification. The cab driver Retlinger was brought to Los Angeles by the fastest means available. As the only person known to have seen the missing woman, his help was of the utmost importance. I'm sorry we have to rush you, but you're the only one who can help us identify this woman. I told you before, so high, big blue eyes, nice figure. Yes, yes... Mr. Harris, Mr. Retlinger. - How are you doing? - Hi. Would you sit there please? Thanks. This girl was a doll. Retlinger, do you think this is the general shape of her face? No, that looks too much like a prize fighter. She had a nice chin, you know? No, no, it's too square. Too square... A little more... rounded. Yes, now is more likely. - I got it. - And how about her hair? Her hair? Yes, she had a nice hair. Looks like she had just stepped out of a beauty parlor. Let me see this. Put that on. Yes, that's nice. Now, what about her mouth? Well, give her a kind of a Pretty one. One with a smile on. We can try this. And she had pretty teeth too. What about this? No, no, no. Do you get something that shows her teeth? Here we are. Yes, that's nice. Okay. How about the eyes? Nice big blue eyes. You know, she those black eyelashes around. How about that? No, too sleepy. Let me see what you have there. How about these? Yes, they're fine. That's nice now. And she had eyebrows that… you know, as if she had pulled them out with pliers, you know A little bushy, huh? Yeah. No, No, that's it. Now you're getting there. Let's see, there is something missing. She did have a nose, didn't she? Oh, yes, nose. A little pug nose. Kind of cute. Any of these? Let me see. Yeah. Let's try this one here. No, that isn't it. How about this one? Yeah, yeah, try that. Now we've got it! She is getting better all the time. If I had a name and address, we'd be old friends. Is there anything you want to add or change to this? No, that's the closest as I can get to. Get this picture out as fast as you can. Hey, what happen to me now? He will take care of you. I'd like to get on a flight to Honolulu tonight. Nothing open yet, ma'am, but I'm sure we'll have something. May we call you? Yes. At M-A-O-7-4-5-5. Thank you. Coffee, please. This is an emergency bulletin direct from the Los Angeles Police Department. Anyone seen or knowing the whereabouts of this young woman, blonde, age 27 woman wearing a brown suede coat, kindly contact the Los Angeles Police Department immediately. Telephone Michigan 5-2-1-1. This is has been a police emergency bulletin. To Laura Greeling it seemed that every eye is on her. Her one impulse was to get out of the street. To get away from those prying eyes. She checked into a small hotel using the name of Alice Thompson. Thank you. ...command this afternoon... Can you connect me to Trans Orient Airways please? 1957 Mercury.

Now, in desperation, she knew she must change her appearance as well. Do you have anything in tweed coat about, size 12? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. John Hand worked late at police headquarters, checking possible leads that might take him to the missing woman. Rattigan, extension 31. Thank you. Hand speaking. Thank you. I'll rush right over. A clerk from a small hotel in Wilshire District. Said he's sure that the woman we're after just checked in using the name Thompson. - Hello? - Mrs. Thompson? - Yes? - This is Trans Orient. We have a last minute cancellation on our 11am flight to Honolulu. Can you go to the airport immediately? Yes, I'll be right the way. We will hold your reservation until five minutes before takeoff. Thank you! While Laura Greeling was slipping out of the hotel unnoticed, Hand and Rattigan were racing through the streets of Los Angeles. What, she's gone? Looks that way. Hey. She must have done a lot shopping. She sure did. The minute she got into the room she got on that phone. Airlines, department stores, even a drug store. - Drug store, huh? - That's right. Had all the stuff delivered. Big rush. New luggage too. Hey. Here they are. That does it. - She called airlines, you say. - That's right. Trans Orient, Pan American... Where was she interested in going? Well, I happened to hear... I don't make a practice of listening... Yes I know. Where was she going? Honolulu. One the worst way to get out tonight. Thank you.

She came from Honolulu and now she's trying to get back. There are a couple of flights leaving tonight. I want you to get down to the airport fast. I'll call you as soon as I get some information. What kind of clothes did she bought and what she looks like now. Alright, I'll contact... Go ahead, I'll take care of it. Yes, sir. Hello? Give me the US Army Chemical Warfare Service at Fort MacArthur, please. Trans Orient Airlines Flight 12 to Honolulu Now loading at gate 6.

You forgot to check in your luggage. They are holding the plane for you, please hurry. Thank you. Will Mr Rattigan please report to the Trans Orient Airlines ticket counter C. I'm Rattigan! Mr. Hand called a few moments ago. He said the woman you're looking for is wearing a tweed coat and she's now brunette. Thank you. Did the passenger by the name of Alice Thompson check in? Mrs. Thompson has a reservation on flight 12 for Honolulu, but I guess she is a no show. They've been paging her. There... Are there any good looking brunettes on Flight 12? Several. One wearing tweed coats? Two or three. One has just left here to the plane. Pretty girl named Greeling. Hold it! Would you please sit down and fasten your seat belt, sir? Flight 12 clear to takeoff.

Are any other good looking brunettes on this flight wearing tweed coats? One more about over there. Would it be possible to clear up the lounge ? I'd... I'd like to talk to these young ladies one by one. If is necessary... Yes, it is necessary. Very well. John Hand made an immediately effort to get in touch with Rattigan through the radio facilities of the airport control tower. He was not able to establish contact, however, until Flight 12 was well over the Pacific. Get me Trans Orient 12, please. Trans Orient 12, this is the Los Angeles center, over, Los Angeles center, this is Trans-Orient 12. Go ahead. Well, Trans Orient 12. We have Mr. Hand from the Office of Internal Security here.

Well, Captain, do you know what a "Typhoid Mary" is? - A carrier of contagion? - Yes. A good-looking brunette you just heard me to talking about, might be a thousand Typhoid Maries rolled up in one. Oh fine! What happens if you can find her? - We'll turn back. - Turn back? Well, mister, you haven't got all night to find her. Around 3am, we'll be too far out to turn back. Mr. Rattigan will explain, Miss Meyers. Miss Meyers, I'm looking for a girl. It is vital that I find her. The lives of very one in this plane may depend on it. The next girl, please. That will be Mrs. Laura Greeling. Thank you. Yes. - Mrs. Greeling? - Yes? My name is Rattigan. I would like to ask you a few questions. Of course. Do you have some means of identification?

How much longer until the point of no return? Less than an hour. Give him a call. Trans Orient 12. You bought this coat in New York, Miss Frohman? I got it in New York. I'm a buyer, Mr Rattigan. A buyer never buys anything for herself. Mr Rattigan, to the flight deck, please. Hm... Excuse me. This is Rattigan. Rattigan, they tell me less than 40 minutes for the point of no return. What did you find out? Two of the women checked out. The third one is called Jean Meyers. I'll work on her. Get busy, will you? You don't have much time. Yes, sir. Would you mind? Pardon, sir. Oh, certainly. You said your name is Jean Meyers. Can you prove it? Of course. I have a driver's license and some traveler's checks. Well I've... I must've left in my other purse. And where is the your other purse? I packed it in my suitcase. I can certainly identify myself as soon as we get in Honolulu. No, I have to find out now. Find out what? Miss Myers, there is a species of fungus that threats the Earth today. Its discoverer, Dr. Pommer, called it Blood Rust. I've seen the Blood Rust. It killed the man who discovered it. I saw what was left of it. The woman I'm looking for maybe a carrier of this thing. She is the woman who was with Pommer on the day before he was killed. Now, are you that woman? No, I swear I'm not. Well, give me your baggage check. I'll have to get your suitcase. If your story about the other purse isn't true, you might as well tell me now. It is true. I got to get into the baggage compartment. You'll have to go through the emergency hatch. Jim, take him back. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry to disturb you. Will you please move forward? I need this area clear. Find any empty seat. Excuse me. What that man want? Why he keeps bothering us? He says there is a horrible stuff called Blood Rust, That could destroy the Earth if ever got started. He thinks one of us might be a carrier. He says this blood rust killed the man who discovered it. I'm the woman you're looking for. I was with Dr. Pommer. Tell the captain to turn back. Get whatever orders you need, but get the ship turned on. Hey, we're turning around. What is going on? It's all right, there are no emergencies. It's just a precaution. Rattigan, to the flight deck. Lock that up. This is Rattigan speaking. You found her? Yes, I found her. And I found Blood Rust too. The baggage compartment is crawling with it. Try to keep this stuff confined at the baggage compartment. Is the captain listening in? Affirmative. Captain here. Captain, I'm gonna have to get you down as quickly as possible. Santa Barbara is our first landfall. How about Santa Barbara airport? No, they don't have the facilities I need. Make it the Oxnard Air Force Base. Oxnard Air Force Base.
