[♪] Isn't it rather odd that your mistress hasn't put in an appearance at her own party? Yes, madam, I'm sorry, madam. Where is she? Where is that wife of mine? Take it easy, Rumsford. A drink, sir? Any word from Mrs. Rumsford? Not a word, sir. I'm terribly upset. You're upset? What about me? She invites these people to her party then runs out on them. She always does that, sir. She'll probably be back in a day or two. Day or two? Snap out of it, Rumsford. You must make allowances for her youth. Sherry'll turn up. If I didn't love that woman so much, I'd swear I'd-- [HORN HONKING] [CROWD GASPS, TIRES SCREECH] Oh, darling, hello. I'll be right over. Oh, Williams. Ready, madam. Listen, York, you're a doctor and you're my best friend. Isn't there anything you can do for her? I'm afraid she's a bit out of my line. The men you want are Doctors Ziller, Zeller and Zoller. You think they can help her? Well, they're the finest psychiatrists in the business. They're terribly expensive and their methods are very peculiar, but they do get results. I'll have Williams call them. I'll have Williams call them immediately. I've got to see a patient, Rummy. I'll try to get back later. Good luck. Thanks. Oh, Williams. I want you to telephone Doctors Ziller, Zeller and Zoller. [TAPPING] Oh, this switchboard! Oh, it's dead. Thank goodness you're through. I've been almost crazy. Yes, ma'am. I'll have my stuff out right after lunch. Looks like there's nobody here. This is the place all right. Maybe I got the-- Pudding head, why don't you look what you're doing? I couldn't help it. I was looking to see if there's anybody, and when I turned-- Look what you did! What?! Oh! Why don't you be careful? Oh! Drop that ladder before you hurt somebody. Oh, oh! Remind me to tear out your Adam's apple. I'll make a note of it. Give me that. [GROWLS] What's the matter with you? [GROWLS] Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Oh! You'll break my pencil. I'll break your head. Say, what war is this? Never mind. We're troubleshooters from the phone company. What's wrong? Painters ruined my switchboard. Come on. If you can bring it to life and a call comes in for the doctors, say they're out. I'm going to lunch. Okay. Hey, bring me back a piece of burnt toast and a rotten egg. Burnt toast and a rotten egg? Yeah, I got a tapeworm and that's good enough for him. Go on, get busy. [WHIMPERS] Oh. How's she coming? Not so good. Say "ah." What do you got here? Hey, give me that, give me that. Oh, oh! Oh! [TEETH CHATTERING] Now go on, get busy like I told ya. Go on! Pull this line through and hook it on number six. Ow! [YELLING, CRASHING] Hey, Larry, help me, I'm surrounded. Get up. Ooh. Get ahold of that. Oh! Hello? Yes, I know it's out of order. I've been trying for half an hour to get it. What's the matter with you? You've been acting nutty all day. It's Gertie, she's going to have-- That's wonderful. When do you expect it? Any minute, that's why I'm so upset. No fooling. Why didn't you tell us? But, you see, I-- I know, you're broke. Flat as a floogy. That's bad. We gotta figure out a way to get some money and get it quick. Oh, thanks, Moe. You're welcome. Okay, I-- Come on. [BARKING] Come on, get to work. Now, operator, you must get that number. Now, try again, please. Ah... [BUZZING] Hello, operator? Is this Susquehanna 2222? Two, 2, 2, 2? What do you think you're doing, playing trains? Oh, I love to play trains. [IMITATES TRAIN] [IMITATES WHISTLE, STEAM] Why don't you get a toupee with some brains in it? Ah! Oh! Why y-- I want to speak to Dr. Ziller, Zeller or Zoller. This is an important case. We'll pay any price, if they'll come over immediately. Money is no object. We'll be there in a flash in the flesh. We need money, and I got a way to get it. What are we supposed to do? You're Ziller, you're Zeller, and I'm Dr. Zoller. Oh, glad to meet you, doctor. How are you, son? Listen, doc, I'm troubled with TS. What do you mean, TS? Two stomachs. Stick out your tongue. Oh! There's an impatient patient waiting. Come on. Wait a minute-- [CURLY WHIMPERING] RUMSFORD: Listen, darling-- [LAUGHING] Wait. Sherry, you can't run out on your guests like this again. But, darling, I'm bored. I'm only going for a short ride in a submarine. I'll be back in a day or two. Tell 'em all to wait. But, Sher-- [BELL RINGS] Gentlemen, I'm Mr. Rumsford. Looking for someone? I'm Ziller. I'm Zeller. MOE: I'm Zoller. Stick out your tongue. Say "ah" with your mouth closed. Ah. Ah. ALL: Ah, rats. MOE: This is serious. You're wrong, gentlemen. It's strictly a case of latkes and pippic. [LAUGHING] This is priceless. I'm not the patient, it's Mrs. Rumsford. CURLY: Oh, how do you do, madam? Now, see here, Sherry-- Oh, darling, you take the submarine ride. I wouldn't leave these men on a bet. Come, gentlemen, the last one in is a Republican. [CURLY WHOOPING] Sherry! [CURLY WHOOPING] Oh, isn't this fun? [CRASHING, SCREAMING] Oh, Countess, I'm so sorry. Really! Oh, Uncle John. Oh. I'll get you a drink. Gentlemen, what will I do with her? Now, let me tell you a little bit about Sherry. Don't bother, I'll take Scotch. Make mine rye. I'll take gin smothered in bourbon. Nyuck, nyuck. Boys. CURLY: Whoo! Gentlemen, do have some rum punch. Rum punch. Why, certainly. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. I knew this thing would come in handy. Will you join me? Certainly. Skoal. Skoal. [SLURPING] This is weak. Yeah. The rum went through this punch on stilts. This Scotch ought to help. This gin should make it fizzy. Bourbon and rum ought to help some. [SNEEZING] Hors d'oeuvre? No, hay fever. [LAUGHING] Oh, witty! Hey, here's some new kind of liquor. Worcestershire. Oh, ho, ho, ho. This says TOBASCO. I ain't never drunk any. We'll put it in. What have you got to lose? Hm. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Champagne-y. [TEETH CHATTERING] Mm. [GASPS] You shouldn't handle dangerous weapons. Give me that. I will not! Let me have it! Oh... [GRUNTING] Look, it's boiling. CURLY: It must be done. A marvelous accomplishment. A prodigious achievement. You said it. It's putrid. Gentlemen, will you be good enough to look my wife over now? A pleasure. This way. The doctors are going to look you over. Oh, goody. Now, uh, we shall test your reflex first. Okay, doctor. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. [LAUGHS] Hm! [LAUGHING] Hm! This is the way a normal reflex should act. Hm. I beg your pardon. Oh, you don't have to apologize. You can't help if you're crazy. [CHUCKLES] Come here, guinea pig. Now then, holding the palm on a 45 degree angle. Must be off a couple of degrees. Trouble is, you got no life. Oh! I made it! [WHIMPERING] [GRUNTS] Pardon me. I'm sorry. Oh. Hm! Hm! Oh! Ooh! [WHIMPERING] [THUD] Hm. [HOLLOW KNOCKING] Come in. I-- [YELLING] Oh, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. [YELLS, BARKS] Dinner is served. Eat. [YELLS] [LAUGHING] [CURLY WHOOPING] SHERRY: Aren't they marvelous? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] CURLY: Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. I just love cream puffs. Oh, I hope you gentlemen will like my Spanish dinner. I'm just crazy about Spanish food, especially corn beef and cabbage. Ha-ha. Isn't he funny? What's all the fuss? I believe I dropped my serviette. Well, just keep seated, nobody'll notice it. Okay, have half of mine. Thank you. [BUZZING] Oh! [YELPS] Really. Biscuit, madam? No, thank you. Sir! Quiet! Biscuit, sir? Oh, certainly. Ha-ha-ha. Biscuit, sir? Hey, where's your Emily Post? This is my favorite dish. Biscuits. Biscuits all the time. [LAUGHING] Hm. Hm. [GROANS] [SIGHS] Uh-- Ugh! Ugh! [SHERRY LAUGHING] Oh, you funny, funny man. Yes, isn't he a scream? Ooh, I just love tamales in the spring. What a funny thing, you don't know whether it's coming or going. Hm. Speak to me, so I'll know which is the head or the tail. [BARKING] Quiet now, quiet. CURLY: Nyuck, nyuck. Mm. This thing can't lick me. Mm, stubborn, huh? Oh. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Get tough with me. Ah! A bomb, an infernal machine. Mm! Hm! [GROANS] Why, you-- LARRY: I'm sorry. Don't throw it. Don't throw it. Why, you-- Moe, don't! [YELLS] I ducked, and I-- Ah! [LAUGHING] [SHERRY LAUGHING] Oh, no, no, no, no, no! This is outrageous! I demand that something be done-- [SHERRY LAUGHING] This is all your fault, you. [WHOOPING] [GASPS] Cut it out, Moe. Oh-- Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. [BLOWING] You missed me, ah. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Yeah. That'll teach ya. Folks, this must stop! Ah! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SQUEALS] I surrender. I-- [GROWLS] Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. [ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] Dr. York just-- [GRUNTS] [GROANS] WOMAN: Oh, how dare you! Gentlemen, I think you better leave now while my wife's enjoying herself, before she changes her mind. Believe me, I'm grateful. Will--? Will about 1500 do? Oh, that's just right. Thanks. Whoo! Ha-ha-ha. Oh, my birthday cake. Oh, darling, in all my life I've never had so much fun. Ha-ha. Me too! [♪]
