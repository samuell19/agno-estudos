[Boy] All my life I've been in love with Missy McCloud. That's her, back at her first grade birthday party. Even at the age of six, Missy was the kind of girl... that everyone just liked being around, me especially. That's me in the back, with the little red fireman's hat on. And that is the most amazing present in the world. It took me almost a year to save up enough to buy it. And when she opened it, I was sure she'd fall helplessly in love with me. - It couldn't fail. - I love it. Johnny, don't you have something for Missy? [Johnny Narrating] This was it, my golden moment. In front of everyone, the most exotic creature alive... would fall totally in love with me, forever. I had the confidence. I had the gift. - Well, son? - But I wimped out. [Woman] All right, kids, cake time! Come on! [Kids Laughing, Shouting] What are you looking at, dirt bag? Here, honey, you sit there. [Woman] Make a wish. - Happy birthday! - [Man] That's my girl. [Johnny Narrating] Over the next 12 years, I lusted after Missy. She filled out in all the right places... the ones I'd been reading about in the National Geographic. The more she grew up, the more helplessly in love I became. That was the problem. Well, you know what they say: love makes you do crazy things. Well, my love for Missy drove me to do the most unimaginable thing... one human being can do to another, but that comes later. My story begins at the end of my senior year in high school... on the historic day after Missy broke up with Buck Van Patten... her boyfriend for the last six years. I was ecstatic. This day was the beginning of the end of my life. [Alarm Ringing] Damn right, 7:15. [Groans] Huh. Doom. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. - What's your hurry there, son? - Today I'm going to ask... the most perfect girl in the world to the prom. Oh, you're going to ask your own mother, eh? [Giggles] Oh, you. Sit down, honey. Breakfast is ready. - No time, Mom. - Always time for a good breakfast. - You're absolutely right. - A donut isn't breakfast. It's fine, Ma. Where's the vitamin C? Where's the fiber?

Now who can tell me how heroes are created? - Gerald? - Th-That's a tricky question. I don't think heroes are born, I think they're made. They're normal men faced with extraordinary circumstances. My personal hero is Jane Goodall. When she was born she didn't know anything about apes and their culture... - but as she grew, she studied really hard... - Hey, Tiger. - You talkin' to me? - Mm-hmm. I know that you've been really concerned lately that you're still a virgin... and you don't have a date to the prom. And that you're sexually stupid. But those things, they mean nothing to me.

Been a long time since anybody came back from the dead. I think the last time was Thanksgiving, 15 years ago. Hey, wait a minute. Did you say come back from the dead? Yes.

Only death awaits you among the living. - I am among the living. - You're undead. Hey, look, just because I crawled out of a grave... doesn't mean I'm a friggin' zombie. It does if you were dead before you went into the grave. Okay, look, I admit maybe I got shot... - but I didn't die. - You're very unreasonable. Excuse me. Where do you think you're going?

I didn't say you were an asshole. It's just that some people might consider being dead somewhat... unfashionable. - That's really shallow of you, Eddie. - Shut up and eat your food. God! I can't eat this. It's disgusting. You never thought it was disgusting before. This is totally different. They must have done something weird to it. If you don't want it, I'll eat it. - [Screams] - What? What do you mean, "What?" You just tried to take a bite out of my arm! Oh, I'm sorry, Eddie. It was just gonna be a little bite.

Uh, yes, Dad! Here, take your ear. Oh, shit. But... [Johnny Narrating] I heard someone my age is supposed to be comfortable... with the way their body changes, but given the circumstances... this was too much. - [Doorbell Buzzes] - Dr. Bronson? - [Buzzes Again] - Dr. Bronson? - Yes? - I'm dead. [Sighs] Okay, well, you're dead... which is unusual because we don't normally see this much activity in a dead person. - Let's look at your symptoms. - I'm decaying. Oh, good. Symptom number one: decay. All right. Is that your ear, then? It fell off about 20 minutes ago. May I see it? It's still in good shape. It's just not on my head. Hello? Hello? I'm just teasing. - May I keep it? - No way! Well, I need skin samples so I can run some tests. Well... here. - [Skin Ripping] - Well, that's very disgusting, but I guess that'll do fine. Isn't there, um, some kind of medicine I could take while you look at that? - A shot or something? - To avoid decaying? - Yes! - No. Everything that is dead eventually decays. Oh, my god. Wait, wait. I do think maybe I... - Aha! - "Aha" what? I think I can help you with that ear. - You want me to glue it on? - Well, it's either that or the staple gun. Okay, fine. This takes care of my ear. What should I do about the rest of me? You really want to know what I'd do in your situation? [Johnny Narrating] That's when he sent me to Maggie Benson. The doctor said that at the rate I was decaying... I'd be dead, really dead, by tomorrow. - So Maggie was my only choice. - [Knocking] Local legend had it that her husband came back from the dead 15 years ago, just like me. So if anyone could help me with my decaying thing, she'd be the one. Hello? Anybody here? [Screams] [Maggie] Oh, my dear boy. You're a zombie. So it ripped right off in her mouth, did it? Yes, ma'am. Right off. [Laughing] That must have been so embarrassing. You have no idea. She must be quite a gal. She is. But I don't know if she'll even see me after what happened. Have a little faith. Things aren't so bad. No, they're pretty bad. I just found out I'm gonna be really dead by tomorrow. I was told you knew how to stop that from happening. Oh, Johnny, I... I haven't talked about zombies for a long, long time. I need to live long enough to go to the prom tomorrow night. I'll do anything. - Oh, no, don't be so quick to... - Anything. Oh, my dear boy, you don't understand. There is something you can do... but it is a terrible thing. Tell me. [Sighing] Flesh of the living. The more you eat, the more time you have. Are you crazy? There's nothing else you can do. There's got to be. Look, I almost took a bite out of my friend Eddie and it was such the wrong thing to do. He's very mad. - A bite will give you about 20 minutes. - Twenty minutes? - I need a whole day. - Then you'll have to eat a little more. - How much more? - Oh, my goodness, it's hard to say. An arm, a leg, a stomach, a foot. It's not an exact science, you know. What kind of friggin' nut are you, tellin' me to go out and eat people? I'm not telling you to eat people. I'm saying eating the flesh of the living is... buying you a little more time... but it's an awful price to pay. Well, it doesn't matter because I'm not eating anybody! Well, then you'll be dead by tomorrow. - How the hell do you know? - John Dingle, I know. Well, I'm gonna find a way. [Liquid Boiling] [Doctor Bronson] I have acquired a skin sample... from Johnny Dingle, 17 and a zombie. In order to prevent him from completely decaying... I must use his flesh to create a serum... that will actually reverse the natural process of decay we all suffer... as we grow older. It stands to reason that his zombie flesh should contain within it... the genetic code for the reanimation of dead tissue. - [Explosion] - Ergo, life after death. [Knocking] [Knocking] Hi, Johnny. Hi. What are you doing here? Oh, I just came by to see how you were. How's your ear? Fine. Good as new. Let me see. Wow! You know, you can hardly even tell it ripped off your head. You think so? I was feeling a little insecure about it. [Sighs] You know, Johnny... you're a really good-looking guy. - You think so? - Absolutely. A little style in your... - Oh, shit. - What? [Nervous Laugh] Sorry. Oh, that's all right. It's not your fault. Here, let me see if I can just... You smell really nice. - Thanks. - [Sneezes] Um, my... I'll get it. Got it. Be sure you get it on straight. Oh, it's on straight. There. Much better. Listen, Johnny, it's getting kind of late. I should probably be going so you can lay down and let that nose harden. No, no, wait, wait, wait. Don't leave, don't leave. - I want to talk to you... - Let go! Johnny, I am not even gonna look. Just get this thing off of me. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I'll see you tomorrow. No, wait! Everything's fine. Don't leave. Minor setback. Johnny, look at you! I'm fine. Nothing else is gonna fall off. [Creaking, Falling] - [Gasps] - [Screams] Thank you, God. Thank you, God. [Mother] Shake a leg, Johnny! Breakfast! - [Dog Barking] - Mom, I told you I can't eat that stuff anymore. There's got to be someone I can eat. [Stomach Growling] [Stomach Growling] - Back off, dead boy. - Sorry. - Hi, Johnny. - Oh, hi. [Missy] Do you remember last night when we were in the car... - and your ear... you know, it... - Fell off? Right. Well, that got me to wondering. What if your other ear were to fall off? Uh-huh. Well, then, what if other stuff started falling off. - I don't know, like your arms or something. - Yeah. Well, then if stuff just kept falling off... - pretty soon... - I'd just be a little pile of stuff. Right. So what I was wondering is if something like that might actually happen? If it did would you feel different towards me? Is that what's gonna happen to you, Johnny? It's... It's a definite possibility. Oh, god. You are so different from any other guy I have ever known. Buck would kill me if he found out I was going outwith you. You're decaying and... Still, god, I wish you weren't dead. Me too. You know, I've never kissed a dead guy before you, Johnny. - Got you! - Geez! Damn it! Holy... Come here, you stinkin' dead ya-hoo toucher! - Buck, stop him. - [Chuck] Come here! Hey, come on. Chuck, you don't understand. Come on, Chuck, let's sit down and just hash this thing out. I'm gonna kill you, dead boy! - [Chuck] Come here! - Maybe we should, uh... Come here, you stinkin' dead ya-hoo toucher! Chuck, look. Chuck. Chuck! Chuck, let's um... Chuck. Chuck. - Chuck, let's discuss this. - Okay. [Laughing] - Uh-oh. - Huh? Chuck? You okay? [Stomach Growls] I am really, truly sorry about this, Chuck. There's just no other way. Oh! Oh, no! Oh, hi, Eddie. You know, colleges look at this sort of thing! - Oh. - Johnny? Oh, great. Oh, my god! How could you? You ate Chuck! Not all of him. - [Siren Wailing] - Hello, this is Brenda Bodine and we're coming to you live... from Fairview High School where we just received word that some sort of tragic... - Excuse me. Sheriff McCloud. - I'm gonna have to ask you all... We just received word that some sort of tragedy has happened in the high school today. - Uh, no, nothing unusual. - I was referring to the slaughter. - Right. Well, there was that. - Sheriff... Earlier today one of the students got badly killed. We've heard reports that the murderer might have been 17-year-old Johnny Dingle. I'm going to make an official statement here. Johnny Dingle is dead. Okay? Yes, but then this wouldn't be the first time... that someone has come back from the dead in Fairview... to wreak havoc on an innocent victim. What is a zombie and how can you tell if there's one living in your neighborhood? - [Intercom Buzzes] - Ooh! - [Woman] Emille? - What is it? - You have a patient. - I'm busy. It's Chuck Bronski. He was eaten in school today. All right, all right, I'll have a look at him. But while I'm doing that, I want you to go out and find me a live chicken. - A chicken? - Just do it! All right. Hello, Chuck. My name is Doctor Bronson. How are we doing today? I see. Chuck, you've suffered a lot of bleeding... and there's an ax in your head... and it appears that someone has eaten your stomach. Pulse is a little lower than I'd like. Let's just take a look at your retinal response. Oh, hi. You must be Big Chuck Bronski. Hello. [Big Chuck] Oh, my god! [Doctor Bronson] I have some bad news. Your boy is very sick. He's lost a massive amount of blood... and his pulse and retinal response are poor... and, as you can see, there's an ax sticking out of his head. - He's not sick, you idiot, he's dead! - Oh, everybody's a doctor! You think maybe I could make the diagnosis? - [Groaning] - It's like somebody ate him! What kind of a monster would do that to another human being? - Mom! - [Dog Barks] - Here. - I have a big problem. - John, you have a visitor. - Oh, hey, Eddie. Look, about today, that wasn't entirely my fault. Oh, it's not just today. It's yesterday too. - What happened yesterday? - You tried to eat my arm, pal! Oh, I think you owe someone an apology. I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. Just... Just don't try to eat me anymore, all right? - I promise. - Still buds? - Huh? - Yeah, still buds. Ah, that's what I like to hear. Hi, honey. Hi, sweetie. Oh, son, did you by any chance murder a boy in school today? - It wasn't murder. It was an accident. - Well, I hope you didn't eat him. - [Parents Make Kissing Sounds] - 'Cause lunch is in five minutes... and I picked up something special for you at the supermarket. Oh, boy! - Hi. - Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. - Mmm! - You picked up a little kid! [Mother] Am I wrong, or do you have to eat the flesh of the living? Mom, I absolutely can't do that anymore! Well, there are hungry people all over the world who'd be thrilled to eat him. Yeah, my mom says that to me all the time. [Johnny] Come on, just send him home! - [Doorbell Chimes] - Uh, I'll get it. Oh, shit! [Humming] - Mr. Dingle? - Yes? I understand that your boy is a zombie. - Mm-hmm, yes, that's right. - Well, he killed and ate my boy today... so me and some of the other guys decided to come over and talk to him. Uh, hold on. Honey! - There's some people here who want to talk to Johnny. - Invite them in! Uh, I don't want them to think ill of us. Well, uh, oh! Honey, this is the father... of the boy that Johnny murdered in school today. I know how difficult it is to lose a son. We lost Johnny just a couple of days ago. Yes, ma'am. I'm still reeling. So is there someway we could see the boy? Sure. I think he's hiding in the closet. Johnny! Come on out, sweetie! Are they gone? Whoa! Hey, quit it! - Oh, wow. - Will you cut it out? - Ooh, wicked, awesome. - [Father] Uh, fellas... Johnny's already dead, you see... so, um, you're gonna have a hard time killing him. - Hi, Daddy. - Oh, hi, little Chuck. - Little Chuck? - This is little Chuck? - What are you doing with my one remaining son? - Nice going, Ma. Daddy, that dead-man tried to eat me. - Stop it! - That won't work, you idiots! - But this will. - [Mother] Excuse me. - You wouldn't shoot me. - I might. - Jesus! - Now get out of my house... or I'll clip your manhood. All right, Ma! [Big Chuck] Come on, let's get out of here. Let's go, little Chuck. - All right, Daddy. - We'll be back. [Johnny Narrating] It was time to stop running. Time to summon up the courage that had eluded me for 12 straight years. Time to complete my life's mission. [Football Bangs On Floor] It was still there. Waiting patiently for this moment. Gathering a little dust, sure... but otherwise... untouched. I had the confidence. I had the gift. This time I was definitely ready. [Cars Driving By] [Brandi] I was actually not looking forward to going to the prom. And then my mom found this place where they dye your shoes in the exact same shade... as your fabric... and they're also dyeing my purse. Can I tell you... I am so relieved that you are going to the prom with Buck. I mean... I heard this really nasty rumor that you might be going with that dead kid. Oh... no. We just went to the movies together. He died for me. I figured it was the least that I could do. N-No big deal. ♪ If I was true you'd be a lie ♪ ♪ If I was blue you'd be the sky♪♪ Hi. - Johnny, please, just leave. - No, you have to listen to me. How can you expect me to listen to you after what you did to Chuck? - I wanna talk to you about that. - There is nothing you can say to make things better... because you ate someone, do you understand that? Wait a minute! Are you afraid I might eat you? Is that the problem? Are you kidding me? Will you just leave me alone! You may not know this, Missy, but I ate Chuck for you. God, my boyfriend won't even pump gas for me. What? Oh, geez, Miss, I didn't wanna eat him... but it was the only way I could live long enough to go to the prom with you. You ate someone just to go to the prom with me? I died for you! I came back from the dead for you. - I love you. - [Girls Sighing] Come on, let's go. - I don't understand, Johnny. - What? How... you can love me so much? How you can do all these things for me? By god, if it ain't the zombie out with a livin' woman. - He's mighty proud. - Go get Chuck. Look, Miss... other people might want you because you're pretty and popular... and they wanna be seen with you. I want you because I love you. - And I always have. - [Woman] It's not natural. - What's this? - Open it. I've been tryin' to give you this since the first grade. [Gasps] Oh. You are the kindest, smartest, most beautiful girl I've ever known. And, uh... And I would die happy... if you would dance just one dance with me at the prom. I would love to go to the prom with you. This mornin' he eats your boy and now he's out there kissin' on the McCloud girl. [Footsteps Approaching] - Hey, what are you doing? - Shut up, you little zombie slut! - I am not a slut. - Leave her alone. - She's a good girl. - Good girls don't hang around with dead boys. - Tramp! - Zombie lover. - Whore of the undead. - [Buck] Enough! It's not her fault. She was taken in by his wily decaying ways. - That's not true, Buck. - You don't even know what you're saying. I'll kill him. I swear I'll kill him. - Daddy. - What the hell is goin' on here? Johnny Dingle's what's goin' on. Johnny Dingle is dead. Right? Yes, sir. He ate my son and he's takin' your daughter to the prom. So I'd say that's pretty damned active for a dead guy. I demand a zombie burning! I want vengeance for my son. Yeah, you're damn right! Missy, Johnny, let's get in the car. - [Crowd Chattering] - [Man] Something's gotta be done. [Big Chuck] You got until sundown, Sheriff, to banish that abomination. After that... he's ours. - Why, hello, Sheriff. - Well... to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit? I was hoping to have a word with you about Johnny. I think maybe it's time for the Dingles and the McClouds to have a little chat. - Well, this just looks wonderful, ma'am. - [Dog Barks] Let's all dig in. [Laughs] John, honey, I wonder, could you get us some butter for the croissants? - Sure, Mom. - Thank you, dear. [Laughs] [Gasps] Mom? Excuse me. - What the hell is this? - A body. I know it's a body. - Who put it here? - I did. - You did? - I thought you might like a snack. A snack? What are we, the Manson family now? Where did you get this body? - Found it. - You found it? I was at the mortuary. They're practically giving them away. Mom, they don't give bodies away... at the mortuary. - I sure like beans. - [Sheriff McCloud Laughs] - Everything okay, then? - Right as rain. Mm-hmm. Then let's get right to it, Johnny. I know you killed Chuck Bronski. He didn't kill him, Daddy, he just ate him. [Sheriff McCloud] That's enough, young lady. I'll have no more smart talk out of you! Daddy, what about those guys at the Donner Pass who ate their friends? Nobody got mad at them. - Would you excuse me for a moment, Sheriff? - Of course. You know what Big Chuck Bronski and the townspeople would like to do to your son? They'd like to break out some torches and have themselves a zombie barbecue. - What do you want me to do? - I'll make you a deal. - You leave town right now, - [Clothes Ripping] quietly, never show your face around here again... and I will keep the townspeople off you until you get away. - This sounds like a good deal. - [Johnny] Okay, but only... if I can escort Missy to the prom first. You are not taking my daughter to the prom, you stupid dead son-of-a-bitch! - I am going with him, Daddy. - You are not going, and that is final! You are being so unfair. What do you have against Johnny besides the fact that he's dead? - You need another reason? - What are you so afraid of? That you'll eat her, for one thing. Oh, that's crazy! I would never eat Missy! - He didn't eat us. - He didn't eat the dog. See? Look, you little tough guy... you get outta town now or I will personally kill you again. - You don't frighten me? - Oh, no? - And you can't stop me? - Really? - [Bell Rings] - And what can I get for madame? - Duck, please. - Oh, tres bien. And for the monsieur? I will have the T-bone steak. Excellent choice. And for the le petit monsieur... may I suggest the delicious buffet? Get your food, honey. You just don't know when to stop, do you, you miserable little shit? - This is the buffet? - You tell me? Is there anyone in my family you don't plan to eat today? - I didn't do this. I'm not gonna eat you. - 'Cause you're a coward. - You shut up. Shut up! - Coward. Coward. Oh-ho, you're pretty tough when it comes to eatin' high schoolers. When it comes to chowin' down on a real man, you're quite the little wussy, ain't ya? Listen, pal, you say one more thing... - Wussy. Wussy. - That's it. - Johnny, don't do that. Oooh. - [Bone Crunching] - Not so easy, is it? There's a lot of livin' in that foot. - [Munching On Foot] - There, smart-ass. - Foot's easy. There's nothing on a foot. Now, calf's a different story; all muscle! We'll just see about that. - Oh, you can kiss that calf muscle good-bye, fat man. - [Munching On Calf] [Munching, Crunching Continues] I'm stuffed. You call that eating? A herd of guppies could've picked me clean in half the time. Come on, it looks yummy. Yummy. All right. - [Water Bubbling In Stomach] - [Gasps] - Johnny! - Missy! Daddy was right; you were gonna eat me, weren't you? Don't be ridiculous, I would never eat you. And why not? What, I'm not good enough for you? Johnny... I think you should try. Come on... take a little bite. Don't you understand? I love you. And I love you, Johnny. That's why I want you... to eat me. Don't you wanna eat me? Well... - [Mrs. Dingle] Johnny? Johnny honey? - Mom? Are you all right, son? - Yeah. - You don't look very good. Where's Missy? ♪♪ ["Abilene" Performed By Standard Fruit] [Knocking At Door] Come in. Why aren't you dressed? I'm not going. Oh, sure you are, honey, come on. Hey, Buck's gonna be here any minute. I am not going to the prom with Buck, Daddy. The only person I want to go to the prom with is Johnny. Damn it, Missy! Now, honey, I know that you care about this boy, but... in a couple of months you are going to go off to college... and you'll meet a nice young man who's still alive. - Won't that be better? - I don't want a living boy, I want Johnny. Get dressed! You are going to the prom with Buck! - I am not going to the prom... - And that's final! Johnny, are you okay? I'm really sorry about my dad. It's okay.

I don't care. - I can't take you to the prom. - No, Johnny. - Don't be silly. It's fine. - I have to go. I have to go, Missy. - Johnny, no. - [Door Opening] Buck called. He'll be here in a moment.

Oh, Shelley, I'm about to save a young man's life. A moment every physician dreams of. Hope you won't think harshly of me, darling, but I'm having a thought. - Quick, the solution. - Suppose we obtain a sizable quantity of the zombie flesh. A few arms, a few legs. He's almost dead already. - I don't follow you. - Then if we took the flesh... - [Water Boiling] - and mixed up a really big batch of your wonderful serum... The fountain of youth; cosmetic surgery without the surgery. Shelley, nothing must prevent me from honoring a promise I made to a young man... in terrible, terrible trouble. I think we could make a shit load of money. - What the hell are you doin'? - No, no, what the hell are you doin'? I'm leaving. I can't take Missy to the prom, I just tried to eat her. - Well, then get ready to say, "Eddie, you're a genius." - Why? Because I solved your problem. I know how you can go with Missy without eating her. - You do? - Mm-hmm. My plan is so perfect, so simple. - What is it? Yes! - You ready? Eat Buck. - Are you crazy? - Let's look at this logically. Your biggest fear is that if you go the prom with Missy, you might end up eating her. Not if you're already full. - Eddie, come on. - If you eat Buck, Missy's gonna need a date to the prom. You'll be full, and you'll live longer. - Would you be serious? - I am serious. I'm very, very serious.

You are not supposed to climb out of the grave, muck around on Earth waiting to die... a second time! I-I-I didn't plan that, it just happened. Sorry about all the yelling.

It's all here. May 28th, 8:33 p.m. Robber enters convenience store, threatens Missy McCloud. She attempts to stop robbery. Robber turns to shoot her, in doing so knocks over a pot of coffee with his elbow. - Wait a minute! - Mm-hmm? He was supposed to slip on coffee? Supposed to, but... didn't. It doesn't happen very often but somewhere someone screwed up and the result is... a sad, tragic mistake. The result is I'm dead! Whenever we... make a mistake... we try to rectify it by giving the person a second chance on life; a chance to prove their worth. That accounts for the existence of the occasional zombie. What they do when back... from the dead determines what we do with them in the afterlife. Hey, look. I wanna talk to you about Chuck. He was practically dead before I ate him. I'm sorry.
