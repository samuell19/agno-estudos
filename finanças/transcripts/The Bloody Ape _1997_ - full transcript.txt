(clicking) (electric motor whirring) (clicking) (film projector whirring) (lively carnival music) (circus performance music) - Welcome one and all to the greatest show on Earth! We're about to introduce you to Gorto, one of the most amazing apes you'll ever see anywhere. Very friendly, as a matter of fact, he's better than some people I know. I've ate with him, I've played with him, he's a lovely little fellow, wouldn't hurt a fly. As a matter of fact, he looks a little like your father. You're gonna love him today! He may eat a little more than your father, but he's probably friendlier than your father. He doesn't hurt anybody, you can roll around with him, you can play with him, you can jump around, he's the prettiest little ape you'd ever want to see. Wouldn't hurt a fly, young man. And anyway, it's nothing better to do on a day like today, but hang out with Gorto the Great Ape! (clattering) - Here it comes baby! Been saving it since Christmas for 'ya! (giggling) (car horn honking) Who the hell is that? Where are those Mexicans? Probably at the taco stand! Rat race (mumbles) wet rats! - Anybody here? Hello? Can I get some service here! - Gus get in here. Why'd you let that guy in here? - I don't let 'em in here! - I told you about them people! - What people? - You know them people! Oh jeez another bum bastard looking for a hand-out. - Look could I get some help here? - You people are always looking for help. You people always looking for a hand-out. I gave at the office, scram! - [Customer] That's the reason I came to see you. - What? - I'm here on business. - What kind of business? - Isn't it obvious my car is in need of repair? You run a car repair business here don't you? - We haven't fixed a car here in five years. This is strictly a gas business. If you need gas in your tank, as a gas shop they're required by law to do something. But after that, I got to ask you to leave. - What do you take me for? What is, what is (mumbles) for? What about that? - [Manager] Look, we don't want no trouble here. We're a god-fearing town, we're all god-fearing people, we don't want no race riot here. - What the hell kind of backwoods rigamarole you talking about? My car's stalling, you talking about God? It's my god-given right to get my car fixed anywhere I please, I'm sure it's gonna get fixed here. - Okay, okay, will you just give me a second please? Break (mumbles) got an education. - Wh-what was that? Twp a year, what are you talking about? - Two stole cars. - What are you insinuating? - In-sin-you-What? Look, I didn't go to college. I didn't get no free education like you people. - What people you talking about? - Oh Mr. Mare, Mr. Mare! Can you help with the candy machine? - We ain't got no kid candy, kid scram! - Do you know where I can get some? I found this penny on the street, I said "This must be my lucky day." - No luck here kid. Why don't you try the tight-wad Indian across the street, he's got candy, (laughs), only it's gonna cost more than a penny! - Where's the candy at? - At there across the street. Beat it kid I got cars to fix. - I thought you didn't fix cars. - Look, I had enough of you too punk. Do me a favor, take your jalopy, and get the hell out of here. Yo move it kid before I beat your ass! - Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa hey, have a seat, have a seat. - My mother told me never cross the street by myself. - Well your mommy's right, you must love her very much. What's your name kid? - My name is Israel, but my friends call me Izzy. - That's a nice name, a nice name. - [Izzy] My mom said I'm named after my homeland. Will you help me cross the street? - I'll help you even better than that kid, wait here. (tires squealing) - Stalled my ass! Learn how to drive, will 'ya? - You said you liked candy, didn't you? - Uh-huh. - You think you'll like this? - Gee that's swell. (slapping) - Can I take you home kid? - My mom told me never to take rides from strangers. - Your mom's right. Take care kid. (slapping) All right I'm leaving, but you haven't seen the last of me yet. - Notice anything different about me? - No, other than the fine looking dish by your side. - Well I feel like I gained about five years. It seems like that's how long you've had my car. - Hey look, I just got finished arguing with some sweet talking spade, and I don't need your mouth. - Look, most gas stations can tune up a car in three hours. You had my car for three days. - Look Lampini, I fix the cars here by myself. These spics, they're good hardly for pumping gas. I really should throw 'em out on their burrito eating asses, then they can go back to doing what they do best, having sex with mustached fat women and collecting in welfare for their 14 kids. - Look, enough of your socially conscious vistas into the third-world citizen. What about my car? - I got the paperwork inside. Come on in, we'll finish it up. - All right, I'll be right back sweetums. I'm gonna go drain my lizard. - Hey toots tell me, you're a fine looking piece of, you're a good looking woman. What do you see in that cheap dime-store monkey hustler? - Look, he may not have the charm and stamina you do, but he does wonders with bananas. - You know, I don't get you dames, I'm always packing a wad of stash. How much can Lampini make hustling a monkey? You got some nice action going on there. Why don't you come out tonight, and I'll show you my tools. - Your tools huh? I hope you keep them in good condition. You never know when you're gonna need them. (pliers clattering) - Hey, you got the paperwork on that car yet? - Yeah, come inside. - What's the matter with you? Thanks for nothing, you abusive butt-hole! Hope I never see the likes of you again. - Pay that, here's your bill Lampini, remember, you can't do (mumbles) when it comes to me. - $75 is what a tune up is supposed to cost! You're charging me 205? You'd think I'm paying for a damn wedding! I thought you fixed this car? Looks like the Yucca Flats after a bomb blast! For Christ sake! - Pop the hood, relax, I'll look at it! - I'm pissed! (engine revving) - Hey toots, come here for a second! Can you hold this baby-face? Hold that! - Here? - Right, there, that's fine, right there. - Hey, what the fuck you doing? - Nothing nothing, just hold that, don't look back. - Hey hey, what the fuck you doing? - Nothing, I was checking the uh-- - Yeah yeah checking, I know what you was checking. You were gonna use your dipstick and I don't mean in the oil! - Look Lampini, doctor says I got a problem. - Don't give me any of your two-bit excuses, I've been traveling around the world for the circus for 25 years, and I've seen low, but you are the lowest, lower than dirt. I'd rather have the companion of my gorilla than someone of your ilk. - Speaking of apes, you smell like an ape, your car smells like an ape, and this two-bit whore you drag around? She looks like an ape! So pay me and get the hell out of here! - Pay you, fuck you! You rip off a piece of my cheesecake and you expect me to pay you? You slimy little peep-show pervert! - Get out of here monkey man, you'll here from my heeb lawyer - Heeb lawyer? Well he better know something about sexual harassment! - Get the hell out of here you bastard, you fucking dick! Get the fuck out of here, you asshole! (plodding music) - Come in! - Oh, it's hot in here! And out there! If I had to walk another five steps I would have collapsed! - Well thanks for coming, Rabbi. I'm sorry to call you on such short notice, but I wanted to spring it on her tonight. - Don't worry my friend. Don't worry, I know how things like this can be. She wants a ring, you give her a ring. Tell me, is she a nice girl? - Ah yes, she's the pearl in my oyster, and the crab in my crotch. - What's this about a crotch? Never mind, never mind. Can she cook? - No uh, it's the '70s and I do the cooking, you know, Gloria Steinem and all that? - Vot, her name is Steinem? You're marrying a nice Jewish girl! Ah, Lampini, I'm not one for mixed marriages and all, but you can't beat a nice Jewish girl, they take care of you. May the spritzes on your yom-bhas-il flourish in the year of the Shif-a-hooz-il. - Look I don't have much time, let's get down to business. - Ah, you're just like your father was, always in a hurry. Your people are always in a hurry. You're such a fine young man, helping your father with the circus, putting up the tents, feeding the animals, you're a regular Noah! - That was a long time ago. My family passed on, let's not bother bringing up the past now. - Sorry, sorry. Vhy don't you have some motzoh ball soup or some sour yor-vogles? It'll calm your nerves! - Right Rabinowitz. Just show me what you got. (Rabinowitz clearing throat) - But is this the finest jewel I can lay on you my friend! And for 10 grand it's a steal! - I think that's a bit out of my league Rabbi! Haven't you got anything cheaper than that? - Lampini, what's 10,000 these days? Live a little, love a little Lampini, trust me I stand apart - Yeah yeah yeah yeah - I take care of you! - yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah that's what I'm afraid of. You're gonna take care of me the way you took care of my father. Why don't you just cut the eye wash and show me a nice cheap ring? (Rabinowitz clearing throat) - Lampini, there is no cheap ring. Rings don't come cheap. I don't understand you goyim, this is the most precious moment in your life for, god's sake loosen up the hold on your wallet! - Why don't you loosen up? Your penny-pinching and petty-preaching is doing nothing for my status. - Yiminy shiminy, I'm nobody's Christian shme-dis! You people always have needs for us! But when you're through you discard us like yesterday's garbage, during the darkness of the Holocaust! - Oh don't start with that shit now! What's that got to do with anything? I brought you here to buy a ring for Christ sake! Just! - I know, I know what you're about to do, I know what you're about to do! You're about to blame me for Christ's death! - I'm not-- - Let me tell you-- - I'm not blaming you for anything, I just want to buy a ring for Christ sakes! - All right, all right Lampini! Here's the cheapest ring I can give you. It's $7500.30, but I'll waive the 30 cents. - Oh thanks Rabbi, you're a regular darling! (glass breaking) - Oy! - You lying Hebrew bastard! You just tried to sell me a piece of glass for 57500! What the hell were you thinking? - Look, look Lampini, look Lampini, I got another beauty in here. - The only beauty in here is you! You cheap rotten little loathsome rodent of a man. Please, get the fuck out of here! - Yeah yeah you know how it, I may be all of those things but uh, you gonna buy-- - Yeah yeah out, out, out! - All right, okay, okay, - Come on! - for Christ sakes I'm going! I'll go! Oh, hey, you can't possibly eat all those bananas there, can you? - Do you like bananas? - Vell I like to bring some food home to the wife now and then, she's a lovely young girl, 25 years old, my new bride, uh? Do you mind if I steal a few, just a couple? - Why yes, help yourself. It'll be my way of making peace for the way I yelled at you. - Thanks, just a couple! Vell, it's been nice knowing you! - Till we meet again Rabbi. The fondness for the penny you pinch will not be forgotten. And the assets, now the assets of your lovely young wife, shall be shared with others. (speaks foreign language) - [Rabinowitz] L'Chayim. (dishes clattering) - I made your favorite, sweetums. - Yeah I can see you went all out. - Well I wanted this night to be special. You've been waiting for it for such a long time. - I have something I want to lay on you tonight. Look Lampini, I feel-- - And I feel the same way. The sky has never been bluer, the grass has never been greener, and the Japanese sports cars have never been smaller, ever since I laid my head between your breasts. - Look Lampini, I have no idea what you were just talking about, but my reasons-- - And my reasons are as precious as yours. My love for you is as deep and as wide as the expansions of your vaginal cavity. - What in God's name? - And speaking of God, seems how he put us together, let no man tear us apart. - What's the matter with you tonight, you're acting like a crackpot, like one of those self-proclaimed medicine men from the days of yore. - [Lampini] What do you mean? - No what do you mean? That's the kind of hairbrain jabber you've been barking up all night. Just listen to me for a minute! - No you listen to this! The words I use to depict my sentiments, for you unconditional wanting, merely reflect the fluids of my body and soul. - Look screwball, I've really had enough of this, this is it Lampini. I don't know who you're trying to impress with these uninspired passages from airport romance novels. I mean, you're no Mariel Hemingway. I'm not eating this up. - Well forget what I said. Let me show you with this. After I slip this on your finger, we can continue our excursion of fine food, travel, interesting people, just me, you and Gorto. (smacking) - Continue, continue? When did we ever start? Fine food? I don't call corn dogs, cotton candy and stale popcorn fine food. - But honey-- - [Sweetums] Travel all over the world? I don't call the backwoods of primitive small-town America where the oldest man and the youngest woman are husband and wife, and their children are their cousins. I don't call that the world. - [Lampini] Honey but I-- - Interesting people? Come on, it's a question of whether most of the scabs you associate with can be termed as people! Hell, your best friend is an ape. - [Lampini] Don't question my relationship between me and Gorto! - And don't question our relationship, because it's over! - Ginger, you're the one who keeps me from lashing out at the people who make my existence a living hell. You are the beauty in my beast. You are the decantment from the feelings buried deep within the recesses of my soul! Without you, it will be intolerable to handle the injustices that these people bring on to me! - Lampini, it is so apparent that your feelings for me are much stronger than my feelings are for you. And for that, you will always hold a special place in my heart. The good times meant so much to me. The long walks, the sincere conversations, the bananas and cream, but it's over now. The right girl is out there for you Lampini, I'm not her. Adios Lampini, take care of that monkey. I always did kind of like him. - And he won't forget you, my dear. No he won't, he won't forget you. (speaking in foreign language), Judas. - Lampini, I thought the smell was familiar. What do you want? - Look, I'm not here to argue with you, we go back a lot of years, I apologize. - You got my money? - Oh yeah, I got your money, and I got some exotic bananas from some exotic island for you. - I heard you were good with bananas. - What? - You know Lampini, you're a real cretin, right out of the woodwork. But I like you. Now get out of here, I got work to do. - Well farewell to you too (mumbles), it's been intriguing. Your Tom Foolery and your (mumbles) has given me pleasure. (speaking foreign language) - Gracias tamale to you too. - Welcome one and all to the greatest show on Earth. Today we're introducing Gorto the amazing ape. He's better than some people I know! You'll be able to play with him, you'll be able to eat with him, you'll be able to fool around with him, or you may even take him home and replace him with your father! He's the greatest pal anyone would want to have! I know I'd like to have him, and how about you? Abigail, have you seen Gorto? (rooster crowing) Huh, (mumbles) where Gorto is? No, not today? How about you Christine, have you seen Gorto? (birds screeching) Chuck, have you seen Gorto, my gorilla? - No man I uh, I ain't seen him. - You sure he hasn't been running around here chasing little kids? - No. - Yeah 'cause as you know, he's a dangerous guy, we don't want him taking anybody home, you know? I'm his only father and that's the way it's got to be. No I don't have time for this, I'm looking for my gorilla, Gorto, have you seen him? - No no no I haven't seen Gorto no. - No, no you just been hanging out here? Big ape, walks wide, kind of crunky looking? You haven't seen him? (man mumbling) All right if you see me, give me a holler, okay? If I were you I would never come back. Take care! Listen I'm looking for my gorilla, he's running around here somewhere, have you seen him? - No man, I got this here though, check this out. - No I'm not looking for her, I'm looking for my gorilla. - Aw man, how 'bout this? - No no, you don't, you don't, you don't understand. I'm looking for a gorilla. - A gorilla, nah man look at this lion! - I don't, I don't need that, I need my ape, he's supposed to be running around here and I need to desperately find him. He's gonna pick up little children and take a walk with them! - No no no no no no, check this out! - I don't need, aw, this guy doesn't understand, I gotta to talk to somebody else. - Ah, look here! - Thank you anyway, all right? Later for her. - Hey, what can I do for you maestro? - Well maybe you can do something for me mate, I'm looking for a gorilla, his name is Gorto. He's been running around in the circus, I've lost him yesterday. Have you seen anyone look like an ape, or an ape actually running around? - I haven't seen-- - Chasing little kids? - No. - No. No Gorto, no gorillas. - [Lampini] All right I'll go on, thank you very much. - Thank you. - Jessica maybe you can help me, I'm looking for my gorilla Gorto. He escaped and he's running around the circus somewhere. Have you seen him? He's about eight feet high, four feet wide, real hairy? - No I haven't seen him. - [Lampini] Sure, can't miss him? - No, I haven't. - You haven't seen him? All right you give a holler if you see him, okay? You'll know what I look like, I'll be with the one with the cane. - All right. - Thank you! (circus performance music) Superintendent, my ape has escaped! - Look, can you tell me what the monkey looks like? - Well, he's... I don't know, don't you know what an ape looks like? - Okay. Is the uh, monkey dangerous? - Superintendent, he's as harmless as a kitten. - So this monkey, is he a male or is he a female ape? - He's a male ape. He's definitely a male ape. Superintendent, do you think you can capture him? - Look guy, don't worry about it. It's in good hands, we'll get on it immediately. ("Bullfrog Blues") ♫ You know what I've been smoking ♫ Well did you ever wake up ♫ With them bullfrogs on your mind ♫ Well did you ever wake up ♫ With them bullfrogs on your mind ♫ Well now I'm telling everybody ♫ That the feeling is mighty fine ♫ Well did you ever wake up ♫ With that one woman on your mind ♫ Well did you ever wake up ♫ With that one woman on your mind ♫ Yeah you wake up every morning ♫ Now you're laughing just to keep from crying ♫ I got that bullfrog woman I just can't be satisfied ♫ I got that bullfrog woman I just can't be satisfied ♫ You know I believe I'm gonna take that ♫ First rate train and ride ♫ Oh my, my mommy got em ♫ My daddy got em ♫ My brother got em ♫ Yeah my sister got em child ♫ Woke up this morning and ♫ We had them bullfrog blues ♫ Well when I looked in the corner ♫ Grandma and grandpa had em to ♫ Oh baby we gonna slow down, ow, ow (loud blues music) - Sir I just had a report come in! You know that protest they're having in front of the new munition building down the street? Well, evidently uh, one of the protestors had his penis torn off while he was urinating in the bush. They say it was the act of some sort of animal. Maybe it was the gorilla that belonged to that guy who was here just the other night? - First off, who gives a fuck if one of these morons gets hurt? I mean they're of no use to the community, they don't want to work, they just want to sit back, relax, and bad-mouth the country that made them! And they don't even know what a barber looks like! This kid went on an acid trip, he probably cut her off himself. Now screw this now, I got a donut to eat and a coffee to drink. (ominous music) - [Lampini] Dear Ginger, sweet Ginger. Despite what we've been through, it would be utterly absurd to suggest that I haven't been thinking of you. In fact I can't stop thinking about you. And so, in honor of our very being, I'm sending you this very special gift. Banana cream soap. I made it myself, from the very same bananas we used in our paganistic orgies, that we enacted and worshipped with our sex organs. Use it only in the best of health Ginger, and remember, you're always on my mind. (speaking foreign language), Lampini. - [Roommate] Hey, Ginger, you got anymore soap left? - Yeah use the banana soap Lampini sent me. I used it today, it smells pretty good. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (tense music) - [Roommate] Ginger, Lucy? Are you guys home? I guess not. (tense music) (dramatic music) - Sir have you come to a conclusion on the murder of those girls from last night? Oh I know I'm new on the force, but, personally I've never seen such unsolicited savagery in all my life. This couldn't be the work of a so-called human being. - Yeah. I'm sure it wasn't a human, cause I did some research last night, and it seems this apartment belongs to one Ginger Furez, and she lived there with two friends, you know they were trying to make ends meet. You know Kerry young girls, uh they shouldn't be out on their own like this, they should stay with their daddy's until the day they get married. Anyway getting back to the point, one of these girls had a history of prostitution. I got a hunch that these slaughters were committed by one of those uh, sugar daddies. - A what? - You know, sugar daddies, one of them spiced up pimps. You know this dude gets angry because one of his bitches didn't pay him or something like that, you know, so Superfly hits the roof and he murders the dame. - Isn't that a little far-fetched sir? - Oh I assume you have a better assumption? - Well maybe it was the gorilla? - Oh come on, you watch international geographic, those gorillas they're good people, they just eat fruit and all. That, that gorilla that escaped he probably climbed up a tree and is sleeping like a baby now. As for those gorillas they call pimps, they're the real animals! They make it difficult even for a guy to get a simple slice of cheese. - Wait wait, back up sir, wait. How do you know she was still a prostitute? It said she had a background? - Hey... - And a pimp? Who said anything about a pimp? - Hey kid, it's like potato chips. Once you eat one you can't stop. Same goes for this broad. And as for that, the pimp, he's like a black leach who sucks the bone dry and he ain't going nowhere. (tense music) (dramatic music) (tense unsettling music) - O' Flannery to LoBianco, - [LoBianco] LoBianco here, what's up babe? - Some crazy nigger just tried to run me off the road! - [LoBianco] Yeah, bring him in! - 10-4 Sargent. (tense music) - Sir, there's been a murder over at Picway's Gas Station! - You know, I was just speaking to O' Flannery over the short-wave. He claims some nigger just tried to run him over. His beat's right around the corner from there. I bet you that fellow still has something to do with it! - Look I'm going to the gas station right now to see what happened, you coming? - [LoBianco] Hey, I got a donut to eat and a coffee to drink, I'll be there as soon as I can. (thumping) - I'm investigating the murder of this White, Dick White character. You were there the day he got killed. Who did you see him talking to? - I don't know, I saw talking to a few of the customer's before. - Well give me some names, who was he talking to? I got to know this. - Well there was this kid from the yard, uh the other one, (mumbles), uh, Nancy Walker, and then I a (mumbles) black guy (mumbles), and uh, Mr. Johnson, and uh-- - Wait wait, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa go back, go back, what is this about a black guy talking to him, tell me more about this black guy! - I don't know nothing. I saw the black guy come in here, he came to see my boss, and-- - What did he do, what was he saying to your boss? - He has some problem with his car. - He had a problem? - Yeah. - The black guy had a problem? What was the problem? - The only thing I saw that they were fighting each other. - They were fighting? - Yeah. - The black guy was fighting White? - They fight, yes. - You mean to tell me that this fucking spade comes in here and he's causing trouble for White, and you saw 'em arguing? - I saw everything. - [LoBianco] You ain't kidding here with him fighting this black guy? - Yes. - This is not a game, this is not Chico and the Man TV series, you saw him fighting with White, huh? - I saw it. - [LoBianco] All right, 'cause so I'm gonna come after you, will you testify you swear you saw everything? - I saw everything. - [LoBianco] I might need you, you hear me? - Yeah. - Or else you'll be going back to south of the border. - No! - I'll see you later. I went over to White's place the other night. Just talking to a couple of his co-workers. They say some spook came in and was raising all hell. I bet you this black bastard is the same guy that killed White, killed those two bystanders for their cars, and then ripped O' Flannery's head off. You know what kills me? He didn't even take the cars and keep them for good. He just walked off on foot. - Sir, that's not the issue here. There were four lives snuffed out there, and horribly at that. - I'm just trying to find a killer. I mean this guy, he comes driving in, car's stalling, probably stolen, and after White politely asks him to leave he decides he's gonna take a car free of charge. - Well there was one thing the witnesses all did describe in common. A dark figure. It, they said it was moving so fast it could, they couldn't describe him fully. - Dark figure huh? Moving fast? What does that tell 'ya? We found our man. (plodding music) - Oh my god it's beautiful! I don't believe it! I didn't think something could be so beautiful, it's the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen for god's sake! Oh, God have mercy! It's lovely, it's lovely! Oh God I love it! It's beautiful and so easy to pick up and so hard to put down! Oy, it's amazing these days what these goyims will pay for a fine piece of glass! - [Wife] What about a fine piece of ass? (clearing throat) - I'm coming, I'm coming already, let me just get the sheet. - [Wife] Oh honey can't we just once disburse with that sheet? I need to feel you close to me. - You're a nut! For god's sakes I'm a man of God! Heaven forbid Yahweh would tie my sprazles and frazles, it's, frankle them all over the Holy Land! Keep your shirt on I'll be right in! Oh my God (mumbles)! (growling) (screaming) What is this you crazy bastard? (growling) (laughs) For god's sakes, for god's sakes, what are, hey what are you doing? For god's sakes what are you doing? Are you crazy? (whimpering) (growling) (tense music) (screaming) (dramatic music) - Help me, help me, help! (growling) (bestial grunting) Ow, ow! Oh, oh, oh! Oh! (grunting) (screaming) (grunting) - [Kerry] Sir, the local jewelry dealer Rabbi Rabinowitz and his wife have been murdered. I think you should come to the scene of the crime. - No need, I'll sum up right here. You see this black kid, you know he likes jewelry, you know, they like that, you know like Sammy Davis Junior. So where does he got to buy it? The Jew right. And you see the Jews they like bucks, right? So this he guy wants to charge an arm and a leg, this rabbi, right? So uh, see they're arguing 'cause uh, this rabbi he wants to charge a fortune for jewelry, right? But the black guy says I won't go. So he says you know I'm not gonna go with this, and he leaves, right? And he (mumbles), right, he finds out where this guy lives, 'cause they're good at that. That night he breaks into the rabbi's house, and he kills 'em, steals some jewelry, has his way with his white woman wife, kills her, and he's off to cracklin' fried chicken. - Where do you get your information? Who said anything about jewelry being missing? - Hey I get my information from the streets! Something you know nothing about! Wait a minute I got it! - What? - I remember the number of that pizza parlor, let's call up and order some lunch, I'm hungry. - W-What? - Hey we're gonna be closing in about five minutes there kid. - Ah yes, do you have the movie Midnight Cowboy? - Uh, you're a little too young for that. - All right what about the movie M.A.S.H.? - Oh, we don't have that either. - All right yes, um, - All right. - how about that movie that I - That's all for today kid, I got no more time. - heard about, wait a minute! But wait, I, I I need a movie! - That's all for today kid. I got no time! - But wait, I need a movie - There you go. - for my fam, no, no! - Another day, another dollar, and another hump out the door. Hey buddy what can I help you with? - Hey ya chief, I uh, I just want to rent a movie. - What are you looking for pal? - I'm looking for, what have you got, horror, that's right, any horror you got. Just name me a title I'm out of here. - Uh, how 'bout 2000 Maniacs? - I saw it, I I saw it, that's all (mumbles). - Uh, Blood Thirsty Butchers, they chop 'em, they whack 'em, they smack em. - No, no no no. Uh, it's obvious you don't got nothing here that I want horror-wise. I came in here for horror and you don't got any. - You telling me buddy, huh? - That's, help me, listen. How about something just a little bit romantic, you know, I wanted R-- - Romantic? - How about, how about Love Story? - Love Story? - That'll get her in mood. - All right look, that's it, that's it. - Hey hey don't touch me! - That's it! - Don't touch me! - I said that's it buddy, (customer arguing) let's get the fuck out of here, I've had enough of your shit for the day. - [Customer] (mumbles) gonna hear about this! - Ah fuck him too! Ah another day another dollar. This nickel and dime business it's a miracle you can make a fucking buck. These scumbags over at AWHT. (knocking) What the hell is that? What the hell are these niggers doing in there, I had a (mumbles) at this hour. They're taking over the fucking business. They must be whacking their black bananas. Wha! - [Kerry] There's been another murder. This time at the new video store! - I don't believe this! Now what? This guy's really getting around, he's obviously (mumbles)! - Actually we did pick up a guy who fits the description of the fellow who argued with White at the gas station. They're bringing him in right this moment. - He fit the description? Black, huh? Now we're smoking! We'd better talk to him before that prick Kapinsky gets a hold of him. You know, those civil liberty morons, they're always just hanging outside the station, just looking for work. You know there's three things I hate about that guy! One, he's Polish, two, he's Jewish, three, he's Polish! I hate him! You put 'em all together and what you get is a stupid schmuck! - But sir the man is entitled to a lawyer! - An animal trainer is more like it! - By the way, this hair was found. Maybe it's animal hair. Might want to check it out. It might clear our boy. - Yeah, yeah I'll check it out. You go, you go on Kerry, I got to do something. I'll be right with you. - Now just sit here like a good boy and wait. Detective LoBianco wants to talk to you. You're in big trouble buddy. (smacking) - Before I see anyone I want legal counsel! I demand to see a lawyer! - Hi, how you doing? My name is Simon Kapinsky. I've been appointed your attorney. - All right, look man, you gotta help me. These people, they think it's Mississippi 1962. They think I'm guilty of murder and I haven't done a god damn thing! - Look, this Detective LoBianco, he's just one of those typical wops from Brooklyn, one minute the family man, you know, Wednesday night spaghetti and meatballs with the family, the next day he's down at the pool hall talking about his next piece of underage pussy. - Whoa backup up, I don't care about this guys ethnocentricities, he's not doing right by me, he's trying to pin things on me! He had no right to pick me up. - Now listen, I can usually get anybody off. Now if you're willing to confess to a lesser charge, let's say a string of grocery store robberies? - Confess to a lesser charge? I didn't even commit the major one! Listen you gotta help me! - Well my friend, the history of your people, and my people, are similar. You talk about Mississippi many years ago? Try and imagine my parents in Poland during the early '40s, when that crazy bastard Hitler was killing all the Semitic people. - Listen, I don't care (smacking) about you fucking people! My ass is in the sling! You got to help me! - Look buddy, stop yelling, you're showing your guilt. I'm gonna go out there and talk to LoBianco. - My guilt? What bubble gum machine did you get your law degree from? - Look, sit tight, and put yourself in my hands. Like I said before, you confess to the string of grocery store robberies and I can convince LoBianco that you're not the same fellow who did the murders. It's just that simple, and with good behavior, you'll be out in three years. - You slimy dime store hustler. You think I'm as guilty as the others do! - Look, if the suit fits wear it. - [Suspect] You bastard, I want a lawyer! - Sit down! Pipe down and sit quiet. - All right Kerry, when Kapinsky gets through with Stymie in there we go in there, you're gonna play the good cop and I'm gonna play the bad cop, you know what I mean, right? - But what's the point in that? He's not guilty of anything just yet. We're just gonna ask him a few questions. - Not guilty? Don't give me any of that Streets of San Francisco horseshit! This is the real world kid! That punk's as guilty as Hurricane Carter! - Sir, I really don't approve of the way you're handling this whole case. Don't you think that-- - That's just what I don't want to do, think! You don't understand! You kids are too young, this, this bastard, he's trash from the wrong side of town, and he's a killer! - But he's not even-- - No buts, let's just do it the right way, my way! - I want you to fry that schwartze. He's nothing more than street scum! No better than the shit you bring home on your shoes! - (laughs), I love you. You phony bastard. You fucking Jews are a scream. I remember back in the '60s when you phony liberal bastards were rallying behind the blacks pretending to be their friends, promising them the world. Well the truth of the matter is, you're scared to death of them. You saw what they did during the Watts riots, and you didn't want them to do it to you! So what do you do, you pretend to be their friend just to trick 'em. Heh heh, you sly devil. - Would you care for a cup of coffee. - No no no no he don't need no coffee. Here, this is what he wants. Here, go ahead, have some! Come on, I know you people like this stuff, go ahead! - What stuff? What do you mean you people? - Aw come on, I watch Sanford. - Oo oo oo, I can play this here game. How's about some chicken, ribs and black eyed peas, massah? - Yeah yeah, I-I-I think it can be arranged. - You racist bastard! (smacking) You got some nerve trying to impersonate a police sargent. You must be the thickest, dumbest moron I've ever met. - You watch your mouth sonny! I haven't been on this force 17 years to take crap like that from lousy punks like you! - I thought you were supposed to be the good cop? - Ah, yeah. Look, why don't you make it easy on yourself, tell us why you did it, and why! - I didn't kill nobody man. How could I have possibly murdered so many people in so short a time? And such brutal deaths. I know what the paper said. They said only an animal could have done it. How could I have possibly teared the heads off-- - The papers were right, an animal did do it! You're that animal! You fit the description of the assailant, a dark figure! - They said the assailant was an ape! Look the man who said it was, he owns the ape-- - Yeah he's outside, he's outside, you know why he's out there? Because he's waiting for me! I called him down here to talk to him about his lost ape! The only bad ape on the loose is you! - I don't believe this! - Yeah you better believe it Bojangles, your time is up. - Just how is it you associate me with these killings? - You were spotted everywhere a body shows up! For instance that Dick White, good man. I have witnesses that said (mumbles) you arguing with him! You were the last one to see him alive! For Chirst sake, I mean hell, we picked you up only a block away from where that last murder was committed, you know at that, that new-fangled video store! - [Suspect] For Christ sakes you checked the video store, maybe the killers are still there! - Of course I checked it out! - But sir I really didn't case the joint! And what about the hair they found? - [LoBianco] Oh yeah look, no no, I had that checked out with Charlie, it was no good, it was just dog hair. Look look, enough is enough! Take this guy downstairs and book him! (smacking) - Damn it you morons can't you see I'm not guilty? - Get him out of here, get him out of here! - Hey goober, your shoelaces are untied. (thumping) (grunting) (groaning) (energetic music) - Thank you sir for being so patient. - Look Lampini I called you back here. Hey, Lampini, you're Italian, ain't you? (laughs) Yeah, you're good like me, right? - Yeah I'm good like you. You fucking idiot. - Look sir, we called you back here to discuss your ape. Now I'm confident your ape had something to do with these murders. Can you elaborate? - Yes I'm sure it was my ape that's been responsible for the rash of murders. But you must understand that he's lost and frightened, and uh, capable of doing just about anything. - What are you talking about Kerry, we found the monkey who committed these murders! I just want to see if I can help Lampini find his ape! - Look gentlemen, there's nothing more I can tell you. But, as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow morning, only a handful of us will rise along with it. Good day gentlemen. - Hee-yeah. What happened? - The black kid. - What about the black kid? - He got away. - How could you let him get away? - He kicked me in the nuts. - That clever bastard! Where the hell could he have gone? The video store, the video store! The criminals always return to the scene of the crime! We got to get down there! Where's my gun? O'Malley I need a car! No I need a car right now! Come on let's go Kerry. (tense music) (grunting) (Gorto breathing harshly) - Gorto, they're coming for you now. Don't worry, soon it will all be over. You served me well and above the call of duty. I'll never forget you for that. You made tremendous sacrifices for me. But then again I was (mumbles). Well Gorto, we're all climbing on our way up to somewhere. You've just been a stepping-stool for me. Well Gorto, life is like a bean stalk, isn't it? (growling) (clattering) (tense music) - [Person In Hat] Run sweet thing, run! (groaning) (grunting) (growling) (screaming) (tense music) No Gorto, no, no no no no no Gorto, no! (grunting) (tense music) (grunting) - My god man, what happened here? - It was all my fault. - It was the ape, it was the ape all the time. - Yes it was the ape, but he wasn't acting on his own. Apes are usually very gentle creatures, you know. But, but it was the onus of man, that made him do what he did. - Explain dammit, explain! - I, I trained the ape to kill. I trained the ape to, to kill, to kill. So overwhelmed with repugnance for my enemies, that my love for my ape completely disappeared in the autumn of my madness he became the pawn of my desperate evil. I began to starve him using his favorite snack, bananas. When I wasn't dangling them in front of his face, I was spraying the room with a banana fragrance I whipped up from my banana cream soap. Gorto went into a rage upon the mere sight or smell of the bananas. Then I got the idea to do this from my meeting with that scumbag rabbi. His infantile greed over the bananas reminded me of Gorto's childlike tantrums when he was hungry. My woman left, I no longer saw any reason not to execute this plan. Thus I did, soap to Ginger, bananas to that bastard mechanic, and I set Gorto loose. It's a small town, I knew he'd stumble on each meal. He was hungry, he was fearful, delirious, and I knew many innocent people would be killed. But in my world no one is innocent. They all deserve to die. I blacken their Christmas and I pissed on their door, and still there was gonna be more. I played stupid. My ape had escaped and everyone believed me. My alibi was air-tight. I do love him you know. I guess, my lust for vengeance knows no bounds. Was it all worth it? I know if I'd been wiser, this would never have occurred. (speaking foreign language) - Whoa, whoa! (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) - There's your ape! I knew it, I knew it all along! This is the so-called ape that's been terrorizing the community! Jumping turnstiles wasn't enough for him! He should have stayed on his side of the street! See, what did I tell 'ya? People don't think I'm too sharp but I knew damn well it was that silly spook! Come on. - Look, I'll give you a report in the morning, all right? I just want to get out of here, I have to get some sleep. - Yeah, you're just a kid, you're not used to this blood and guts. You need to become a man like me. Yeah, I'm good that way. Hey uh, why don't you hang out with me tonight? There's this new deal. You plop down a $100 deposit, and for $15 you can take a flick home for the night. What do you say? - No thank you, I just need to get some sleep, all right? - All right, all right, goodnight crybaby. Heh heh heh, yeah! I like this Johnnie Keyes, good actor. (dramatic music) (grunting) - Who the hell is that! Where are those Mexicans, a taco stand? Fuck the rat race, should have called wet (mumbles), uh... Stalled my ass. Learn how to drive (laughs). The paperwork inside, come on in we'll finish it up. - All right, I'm gonna go drain my sweetum-- (laughing) - [Director] Action. - [White] Hey toots tell me. - [Ginger] (laughs) Wait. (crew laughing) - [Lampini] The words I use to depict my sentiments for you for unconditional wanting, a blip blah... (laughing) - What's the matter with you tonight? You're acting like a crackpot, like one of those self-proclaimed medicine men from the days of yore. - What do you mean? - No what do you mean? - You are the beauty within my beast. You are my decantment, from the deep (laughs). Ginger, you're the one who keeps me from lashing out at the people who create an (laughs) - [Director] Cut. Action! - [Lampini] But honey I-- - Interesting people? Come on, it's a question of whether most of the scabs you associate with can be a, terms, forget it. - [Lampini] You give out fries with those shakes? (chuckling) - [Director] Ready. - Ah I'm really not for for these uh, mixed marriages, but you can't beat a nice Jewish girl. They take good care of you. May the yom-bozzle, on your shva-hitses, flourish to the year of the yam-bozzle. (laughing) - [Director] Cut it. - Vot? Her name is Steinem? You're marrying a nice Jewish girl, oh, Lampini! I'm not one for mixed marriages, but you can't beat a nice Jewish girl. They take good care of you. They're the spriches on your yu-vovle, (laughs). - [Director] Cut. Scene action! (thumping) - Sir, have you come to a conclusion on the murder of those girls from last night? I know I'm new on the force but, personally I have never seen such unsolicited savagery in all my life. (laughs) Cut, one more time, don't keep ro-- - [Director] Action! (thumping) - Sir, have you come to a conclusion on the murderer of those girls from last night? I know I'm new on the force but, personally I've never seen such unsolicited savagery in all my life. (laughing) - This bastard Hitler, was killing all the Semitic people. (smacking) - Listen I don't give a fuck about your people, (laughs). - [Director] Cut. Rolling. - Look buddy, stop yelling, you're showing your guilt! I'm going to be going out there and talking to LoBianco-- - My guilt? What bubble gum machine did your (mumbles). - [Director] Cut. Rolling. - The matter is, you're scared to death of 'em! You are scared to death of them! And you do you (mumbles). - [Director] Cut! Rolling. - You better be there (mumbles), I can't-- - [Director] Rolling. - Pretend to be their friends, to trick them. Dammit. - [Director] We're rolling. Action! (grunting) (laughing) (grunting) - Ow! (laughing) - [Lampini] And cut! (film projector whirring)
