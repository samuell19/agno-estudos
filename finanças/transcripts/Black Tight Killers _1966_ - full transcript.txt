I did the best I could with this... Thank you very much. Miss Sawanouchi... I've been waiting to thank you... But you've already thanked me. My mother always said one can't thank a pretty woman enough... I'd like to see you tonight... then I can give you your pictures too... So even a professional photographer will take pictures to get a date... The end justifies the means... my dad's last words. Tell me where... You asked me for a date... I'm surprised. Why? At first you were so rude... And now? A knight in shining armor! But only for two weeks. Then I'm off to Beirut. The two lovers think They're as one For ever - Now I'm surprised. - Why's that? You handle liquor very well... and... And? You're an excellent dancer. What's wrong? Nothing... just that a strange man... In despair They're united by love There's nobody. Somebody was there. He followed us all the way here... Any man would want to follow a pretty girl like you. You'll share with me The sorrow you were hiding Deep down inside yourself It was a lovely evening. I had a wonderful time. Let's have a nightcap. That's the man! I'll take care of him. But... I won't let any guy brother you! When did you get back from Saigon? This morning... it's been a while. Well, let's have a toast... I have a friend with me... - Already? - Sorry. Next time you buy the drinks. - It's a deal. - See you again. Where did she go? She left some time ago. Left? Yes, quit abruptly... Hey! Just a minute... oh, wrong person. You saw that? Wait... you're all... Alright, I'll fix you. That's the Ninja chewing gum bullet! Let's get out of here. Shit... Mr. Hondo... Why... where were you? Back there... I was so scared... He's dead. That's the one... he came in and I didn't know what to do... Fernando Lopez... Who're those women? I don't know. When I got here, they suddenly attacked him. Let's go right to the police. Hello! It's murder case... Know the place? Come right over... Hello? Can't you hear me? Shit. Mister, I saw the killer. What? - A tall man... well-dressed. - Which way did he go? I'm in luck! Kidnappers! Chase them! What're you doing? Go after them! What're you doing? Let go! How many times do I... I told you... I'm not the murderer! I just reported it! Quiet! There are two witnesses with different stories. They're wrong. Three women in black tights killed the man. My girl friend saw it too. But when I went to call you... She was kidnapped... a likely story. Why won't you believe me? Check the open car. I gave you the number! We've already checked. And it isn't the license of an open car... - What? - It's the license of a hearse! I can't believe she was with you... The victim's been identified... he was marked for illegal dollar deals. Black market dollars and a cameraman just back from Southeast Asia... Then Lopez's murderer is... I had nothing to do with that guy! If I did it, why would I call the police? To conceal your guilt... And you'd make up some kidnap story just to confuse the issue. You've been watching TV too much. Heard a foreigner was murdered and the police suspect you! Wow! Wait a minute... who're you? Bill Sommers... reporter for the Kyokuto Tsushin. He's my friend. I understand what happened, but he didn't do it. We're questioning him now. It's none of your business... get out! Wait. He was with a girl... who'd commit murder on a date? You're sure he was with a girl? I give you my word... yes, this's the girl. I'm clear... let me go. This is an affront to my rights. Police... they can drop dead! I'll find her by myself! You can find another girl easily... But I'm serious about this one. Well, she must be worth it then. Bill, how did you know that was her picture? Just a hunch... bluffed through it. The Black Tights or Lopez's men kidnapped her... I'll get them! She means that much to you? Okay, I'll help you. You will? We're friends. I'll start now. You go home and get some rest. MOMOCHI NINJA RESEARCH SOCIETY Hondo! I'm late. What the devil happened to you? I'm sorry, sir. I was worried about you. Were the police here? I got a phone call last night asking all kinds of questions about you. When you didn't come home, I was wondering what happened... I'm not sure myself. Chewing gum bullet? A Ninja trick? I've never heard of that one! Do you know where she was taken? No, not a single clue... This is the Momochi Vanishing Ball which took me years to develop. Use this in an emergency. I'm not fighting a Ninja war... But it's real easy to carry. And this. It's from an American soldier who came to see my research. Think he said it's used by the US Ninja troops... You mean the Rangers? Yes, yes, that's it. I can't read what it says, but it'll be useful. This is laughing gas. A type of poison gas. P-p-poison gas? Black Tights... Lopez's gang? But why did they take her? What's the reason... what... - Phone call for you... - Who is it? That American reporter... It's risking one's life... With the gold powder covering the body... The skin can't breathe... so you suffocate. Then there'll be no encore. Let me introduce you. Mr. Okada, columnist and former Lt. Colonel. Don't speak of the past. My card. ASIA INFORMATION RESEARCH GUNJI OKADA, PRESIDENT Bill told me the whole story... And I wonder if that's the girl who was kidnapped... Yes! It is! So... just as I thought. But... Yoriko is my niece. Her father was an army colonel, but after the war... her parents died. And I adopted her. Perhaps I was too strict with her... Yoriko left home soon after her graduation... I've been looking for her since... Then you didn't know she was a stewardess? I saw her quite by chance at the airport and I was shocked... And? We had a long talk and she realizes now that I always meant well. She promised to come home soon. But just then, all this happened... I see... Yoriko is just like my own daughter. I'll give anything to get her back. Please help me... Well, I'd like to. But, I have no clues. I found her address, but I doubt if she'd be there. Is that so? Let's check it out anyway. Wish I could go with you, but I've got this leg trouble... If you're in a hurry, I'll give you a ride. Now hurry. Where shall I take you? Anywhere is fine. Don't worry... I've nothing to do. Thank you. You're very kind. I don't do this for just anybody. Looking for a man... My name's Akiko. Where shall I wait for you? I'm afraid I'll be tied up all day. I see... then I'll wait till you're free. YORIKO SAWANOUCHI She's not home. Well, do you live in this apartment? Are you a friend of hers? Yes. I didn't expect she'd be home. Shall I tell you where she is? Do you know? Come. Damn! Careful... there's a lot of hit-and-run around here. What're you doing? The camera's on! Hey, your time's up! I hear you're looking for a woman. - Where is she? - She ain't here. Then why did you bring me here? You killed Lopez. No! Three women wearing black tights killed him. Don't lie... those two men saw you. So you're the ones who lied to the police! Why're you looking for that woman? You won't tell me? Well... tell us the reason now. What's wrong with looking for the woman I love? There must be more to it than that. Don't move! This fires 32 bullets. If you make a move, you'll be Swiss cheese. Every policeman in Tokyo will be on your neck if you fire that. We've got other ways to handle you. Give up now. Don't bother with her. Just... Run! Watch out! Outside! Shit! Wasn't that thrilling! But, why were you there? I followed you. You must thank me. Thank you. You owe me a favor, right? Tell me what you want. Well, I'm a bit embarrassed, but let me stay at your house tonight. Please. I ran away from home today. I played golf all day but... When it's dark, I begin to feel so lonely... please? You use the bed. What about you? I'll sleep here. But I've only one pair of pajamas. Okay, I'll borrow just the top. Shall I go out while you change? No, you don't have to leave. Good night. Good night. It's chilly. Well, this's the only blanket... I know. Just put that blanket over this. Then what about me? You can come with the blanket. You want me to freeze to death? No... I can't do that... But I can't let you freeze... that's worse. Thank you. And what about... Sure, it comes with the blanket. Now the pajamas are back together. What're you doing? Stop that... stop! Let me go! A Ninja trick... Octopus Pot! You're one of them! Now tell me. Why're you after Yoriko Sawanouchi? Let me go! If you don't tell me, I'll kill you! So they're Ninja! I thought you found her and brought her home... What trick did they use? Octopus Pot... Octopus... Yes, Octopus... And how did you get out of it? With laughing gas. But why did that... Don't you see? When people laugh... All the muscles relax... You see? It relaxed... I see... well... relaxed... I'm positive the Black Tights and the Lopez gang are after Yoriko. But the point is which side kidnapped her. And for what purpose. Maybe her Uncle Okada could give us a clue. But he said he hadn't seen her for a long time. I wonder if he could be of any help. Think I'll ask him anyway. ASIA INFORMATION RESEARCH I got it! The killer's picture! What?! So you murdered him! See that? It's no ordinary tape. Sharper than a razor blade. Well, we meet again... This time you won't get away. It's the other way around. We're taking you to the police. See this picture... With proof like this, you'll be in prison forever! I'd like to see you try! If you wish, I'll give you a shave! Or shall I cut your neck off?! The police! Okada's men called them! Get out! Wait! No use struggling... no one's coming to help you. It's alright now. What're you going to do? I've kept you waiting... so you'll receive a special service. What're you doing? You'd better be quiet. I just want you to remove your clothing. Damn! Stop! You may keep that on. You want to make a fool of me? I said you had a treat in store. Now... you can tell me what you didn't tell me last night. What's Yoriko Sawanouchi to you? You tell me something first. Why'd you kill Lopez and Okada? They were our enemies. Death was too good for them. You kidnapped Yoriko too?! That's right. Where is she? She's not here. If you tell me why you want her, I'll tell you where she is. You should know... she's my... Your girl friend... but there's more. What do you mean? You tell me... who's your boss? Now just a minute... Don't try to hide anything or it'll be more difficult for you. Listen! She got away from us! We'll get her again very soon. You stay nice and quiet right here. Nice kid... you're my hostage now. Where's the car? Now... you drive. Where do you want to go? You're very co-operative. What good is it to resist now? Red Star Lily... Flower of Okinawa. Tell me... who are you girls? They're following us! Speed up! I'm going to jump out. You keep on going. You're a good kid... I don't want you to get involved. She was a nice girl... Hondo! Why... No! What? Okada lied! He's not my uncle. He was an associate of my father's. And he was suspected of killing my dad... Tell me the whole story. Why did your father... My father used to be chief of staff in Okinawa... After the war Okada showed up quite suddenly with Occupation troops... They questioned my dad about some gold brought back by the military. It seems they got no answers. One night he was taken away for further questioning... and... A month later his body was found at Shibaura Beach... Had he been murdered? The police said he must have been drinking and fell off the cliff... But father never touched liquor after the war. And he never would've been carrying imported whiskey in his pocket. I see... then what about Okada? Soon he and some officers arrived and took all father's belongings. He kept coming back... threatening us to tell him about some hidden gold. Mother and I knew nothing about it. Mother grew frightened so we moved to an apartment. Okada found that place so we kept moving around... When did your mother die? Soon after my graduation... Her illness was very sudden... And you haven't seen Okada since? No... I had forgotten all about him. Until recently when I ran into him at the airport... Since then his men have been on my trail... But why did Okada tell me about your apartment? I guess your search for me was giving him trouble. That's why his men tried to end it. I'd expect that from Okada... This is beginning to make sense. But why did the Black Tights kidnap you? They must be after the gold too. They asked me about hidden gold when I was their prisoner. Did your father really bring back any gold? He never mentioned a word about it to either my mother or me. I was only 5 years old at the time. Wouldn't there be any record like a military document or something... No. Besides Okada took everything from father's room. I have only his diary... Diary? Any clues in it? Nothing. Just his concern for my future... his hatred of war... I'm surprised to learn about Okada. How long have you known him? About a year... he used to bring in copy on the Asian situation. You never suspected him at all? Okada come to ask for my help in locating his niece... Come to think of it... that was a bit too well-timed. He discovered we were looking for her. He had to keep a step ahead of us. But what about those Black Tights? You're sure this is place? I'm sure. Excuse me... do you know when this place went out of business? About a month ago... the police made them close up. I think they were running... Yes? You know what I mean... I see. They've really cleaned out this joint. There's one more place. Where is it? I have a pretty good idea. Last night was their last show. Don't you know where they've gone? They had no agent... used to work at the military clubs in Okinawa. Okinawa? Yes... strange group... called the "Ninjas". I'll check them out... there aren't too many of these go-go dancers. I must get something from her house. But Okada's men might attack you... Don't worry... I have my weapon. Let me know if you need help. I'll come right over. RENDER UNTO CAESAR So that's the diary. You were looking for this too? I was here first. Give it to me. The Ninja trick of flying disks. Is this what that guy wanted? Don't forget... it's ours. We're the ones who deserve it. Idiot! We lost Lopez. Wait... then we have a say in this. Our chief died for this thing. We're entitled to the profits. Shut up. It's too early for that. We've got to find out how this diary is connected to the gold. Make the guy talk. He won't talk. We've tried our best but he says he knows nothing. There are ways to make him talk. Let us handle this. What're you going to do now? If you want to escape, you must co-operate. Is it possible? If we work together. Alright... I'm with you. You're already tied up with me! Don't talk! Look... let me have a cigarette. Shut up! If you give me a cigarette, I'll tell you what you want to know. No! Don't! No! Stop! What're you doing? Don't worry... I'm just giving this woman a little lesson. Hey! Don't be rough with her! Don't! Please! No! Stop! Let me go! Hey, stop teasing the woman! Well, shall we go? You do voice imitations too? This'll be difficult... there are lots of people in the next room. Don't worry... they'll help me. But... how? Interesting things will come flying. Stay close to the wall. Kikue! This way! Hurry! Are you alright? Hold on. I'm glad we're friends... She was very nice... Thank you. See you again. Damn! Where is she? - She's been kidnapped! - What! About six men came in and jumped me. So careless of me! Be quiet! You think you're all so clever. Just come with us. You gave me a rough time... wait and see what you're getting. Where are you taking me? Where gunshots won't be heard! Mr. Hondo! Yoriko! You don't know where the gold is. Just shut up and watch! Damn! Tell me! Where did your father hide the gold? I don't know. I simply don't know. Don't lie! It was worth 3 million yen. Today it's worth 100 million. He must have told you where it was. My father told me nothing about it. Then why did you keep this diary? What's the significance of this? I don't know... I don't know... Alright... I'll make you talk. Stop it! Stop! You'd better start talking... when your body's painted... you die! Now for a little make-up... I'll tell you! The cover of the diary... one side's thicker than the other... There must be something inside. This is it! Watch out! Why did you...? I wanted... to save you... I wish... I had met you... Earlier... Hey... Are you alright? I don't want you to look at me... Let's go! We can get some paint thinner at a gas station and take that stuff off. Don't cry... you're safe now. What you are...? I'm pretty good at impersonations. This was to sidetrack you... we don't want you meddling in our business. What about Yoriko? Those men got away with her. My girls are after them now. Don't worry... she'll be rescued. I can't wait any longer! Why those guys... Are you alright? Please unhook me... - Does it hurt? - Please hurry! What're you doing?! You feel okay? I did it... that's a plastic bomb. Now hold on... Those men... I heard them talking... They're going to... Ushio Island... Hello... Kyokuto News? I'd like to speak with Bill Sommers. He's not there? Do you know where he can be reached? I see... what time will he be back? Well... thanks. Hondo, what're you going to do? I know where she is now. I must go. Wait. Take this with you. What is it? The Momochi Secret Cannon. Use it. Why, it's you... Mr. Hondo... The other two were killed... What's that noise? It's those men... they found us when we got to the island... One of our girls was captured... now they're looking for me... Get back! Bastard! Mr. Hondo, are you alright? Yes... let's go. They're late. They'll catch the other girl soon. Now stop that! What's the matter? You idiot! Please, loosen it a little more... Shut up! Pretty soon you won't feel a thing. When our man returns with the other girl, you'll be thrown into the sea. Please... the rope hurts. Hey, loosen it a little. Akiko! - Where'd they go? - They left with that girl! When? Just a while ago... in a helicopter. Then the gold was... It was in here... hidden in here? Where did they take it? Some villa near a cape. They were saying the boss would be waiting. That's Colonel Sawanouchi's house. Okada took it away from him some time ago. They treated me like dirt! Damn! They were planning to take us with them? That's right. Let's hurry. Get down more. Well... hold this. What's that? Well, it's better than nothing. Akiko, are you alright? I'm okay. It's your turn. Well done! Mr. Hondo! Yoshie, hold on! Yoshie... You shot the helicopter down... Yes, your rifle hit it. You're a good guy... Yoshie... Now I'm the only one left... There's my boat. Okay. Here. My poor sisters... Were you all sisters? Sisters and cousins... But why'd you sacrifice so much for some gold? That gold is ours... it bears the stain of Okinawan blood... During the war the military seized our gold... Colonel Sawanouchi is the one who brought it here when the war ended. That's your girl friend's father. We found out later that the gold was still hidden here somewhere... If it had been used for the war, we'd understand and forget. But as it is... the gold should be returned to its rightful owners. Recently Okada and some questionable foreigners hired gang members... Together they began to look for it. When we found that out... We decided we had to stop them. Okada killed most of my family and if our gold is lost too... It's awfully quiet... Aren't they here yet? They must be. You stay here... I'll go take a look. Stop that or 500 volts will go through this girl! We were prepared for your arrival. Drop your rifle. We used you to find the girl, but you've gone a little too far. What? Who are you? I see... so you're the boss. You found out a little too late. With your help... we got the gold. You were the man behind Okada? He was my right-hand man since my army days. You had Okada murder the Colonel? Colonel Sawanouchi didn't talk fast enough... I got impatient. I didn't get very far that time... But... when I got out of the service, I returned to Japan as a reporter... Shit... You and your big talk... You've had me fooled the whole time! So... I've got what I want. Now! Dance! Dance all you want! It's your last one! Dave! Kill him! Don't move! You want to kill her? Damn! Hondo... Mr. Hondo, take care of the gold... I can't breathe... Thank you... Take care of the gold... No wonder they couldn't open it. Please... Gold worth 100 million yen... Why, what's this? It's old paper money! Not worth anything today! But why was the gold counterfeited? That was it's equivalent... Then the army really used the gold? "Render Unto Caesar". I think your father planned to repay that money someday... Those girls... I feel so sorry... Not knowing the money was worthless. Risking their lives... Tragic... Such a loss... Do me a favor? Drop this over Okinawa... I knew you'd say that... the pilot's ready... It's all I can do for those girls... I have one question to ask you... What is it? You see... well, that is... I don't know how to say it... Tell me. Akiko... did you make love to her? I can't lie to you... Yes... once. I thought so. But I wasn't sure... it's a shock. Will you forgive me? I shouldn't... but I will. I'm sorry. But there's one condition... Tell me... Then close your eyes. What're you doing? Hurry or you'll be late. Women... Who can understand them? Blown high on the wind... All of the memories... Tinted a sorrowful blue... Always follow... The true love a man can find... The love I treasure in my heart... Now blown high on the wind... Leaving only the memory... THE END SubRip-Corrections-Sync by VaVooM
