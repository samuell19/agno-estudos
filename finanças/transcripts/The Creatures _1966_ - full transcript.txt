Darling, I'm frightened. Of what? Going so fast. Don't you trust me? Of course I do. My little flower, try to relax. Humor me and slow down. Humor me and let me drive. I like to speed. When I race, my thoughts race too. I come up with ideas. It's like being by the sea. You'll see. We'll have a good time. We'll find a house to rent. Peace and quiet. Just you and me. We'll go for walks. Yes, darling. We'll be happy. But don't drive so fast. - Want a ride across? - No, thanks. I'll stay here. - What for? - To watch. You'll be waiting eight hours! A typical workday. I have smokes and a warm coat. Thanks anyway. See you. THE CREATURES NO TRESPASSING It was winter, and nothing seemed alive. “It was winter... and nothing seemed... alive. One wondered... “One wondered...” I'll be back for more this evening. Here he comes! Ladies. I'd like some bread, sugar... two camemberts, six bottles of red wine... and some apricot jam, please. I'd like some bread. It's cold. Clumsy fool! Don't cut yourself. - How much is that? - Go get a rag! 21.60 francs. 23.60. I'll put it on your tab. Very well. Good-bye, and thank you. Good-bye, ladies. Put that down. It's his fault. He scared me. Don't be silly. He's quiet, but he's a good customer, and polite. He's an odd one. Three months, and still a stranger! - He's always walking around. - No harm in that. By himself? I may be old, but I agree with Suzon. EDGAR PICCOLI I'd like 400 francs, please. Yes, sir. There you are. - Thanks. Sheets and fabrics, the latest styles! Good prices. Step on up! That's the guy I told you about. Sheets and fabrics, the latest styles! Step up, ladies! The finest quality! Step up, ladies! No obligation to buy! Shut up! We said we'd leave it open! I'll fix your wagon! - When you're ready, I'll attack. - Just don't overdo it. Come on. He's coming to. Thank God. Bring the bottle. He got what he deserved. What happened? Stay out of this. Take your brother home. It's men's business. Let's let bygones be bygones. No grudges. Though this guy tore up one of my best sheets. That's right. Fifty francs should cover it. And that's a steal. He tore it when he was buying it? When you break something, you pay for it. That's right. Fifty francs. With the cognac, 53. A bargain. Go home now, buddy. You made your bed. Now lie in it! But use good-quality sheets. They're stronger. So they last longer. That's right. Smart lady. Not like that jerk. Anyway, he paid up. He always pays us. - Does he ever say anything? - No. See? I'm sure he's hiding something. I'm fine. I'm better now. WHAT HAPPENED? Two guys picked a fight with me. I don't even know them. Probably took me for someone else. I'm hungry- Smells good. Did you bake a treat? Sure, but my head aches a bit. It's your last meal with us. Fish stew, like every day. I'm not complaining. I'd rather you stay and share it with us. What good is a fisherman with no son? - Don't I count? - We'll talk when you're older. Right now, Simon's leaving. He'd rather work in a hotel. He doesn't have the stamina. But he's not going far. And he'll earn good money. You know I want to work in a hotel. One day I'll be a waiter. - I'll be a fisherman like Dad. - And I'll be a princess. - Idiot! See, girls? It pays to obey. Sorry. Too much pepper. Open up! DON'T GO It's the guys from yesterday. Don't worry. Finally! We thought you were angry. We came to apologize. We were drunk. We picked a fight for no reason. You about finished? We hardly sold a thing yesterday. Business is awful! Terrible! I already paid for one sheet. That's enough. Look here! Look at this fine linen! We're specialists! Only the best! Quality at a good price and for a worthy cause! Beat it! You're nuts! A big house like this needs linen. Six or eight bedrooms! Beds everywhere! We need a good look inside! Lots of beds to make in there! You need lots of sheets! - Be a sport. Beat it or I'll punch you. I couldn't see a thing inside. Now we know who we're dealing with. - Get lost. - Let's speak frankly. Beat it! We can work something out. At least meet us halfway. We'll leave two sets. See? We trust you. You can pay us next week. Two sets for 120 francs is a real deal. I found you in five tries. I'm getting better! My darling. You're being unreasonable. You promised. Of course you can! Why won't you trust me, despite the accident? You never let me mention it. That's why you're mute. It's not an illness. It was an accident. A tiny ailment. I'm sure you'll recover. You must rest... and love me. Thank you. Is this your cat? I found it dead. No, it's not ours. Maybe the hotel's. I'm going to see. Simon! - Look! - You sure it's dead? - Yes. It's disgusting. - The missus will be mad. I see you were expecting me. - Did you kill the cat? - No! I thought it might be yours. Miss Michéle will be furious. Why did you kill it? I told you - What the hell is this? Imbeciles! Savages! You think I killed the cat? You serve cat when you're out of rabbit! - Show some respect! - You probably left it at my door! That's a lie! Just who are you? - You follow Suzon in the woods! - You want cat? I'll give you cat! Please have mercy! On your knees like dogs! Forgive me. I went berserk. I don't know what got into me. I hate being wrongly accused. I started beating them. All because of this dead cat I found. In any case, it's not mine. Don't worry. Sometimes they need a thrashing. With a woman in charge, they take liberties. The entire second floor is being redone, and my father fell ill. He left everything on my shoulders. My cat's fine, I assure you. It's kind of you to come all this way with this mysterious cat. I hope you'll come back again. We have television now. If you want to watch the news or other programs, come whenever you like. You plan to bury it? Of course. I don't want to see that. Good-bye, Mr... Piccoli. I'm staying in the fort. Good-bye. Thank you, Simon. No, I'm not sulking. I just get tired of our situation sometimes. You stop by for an hour or two... then go home to dinner with your family. You're so touchy. Instead of enjoying our love - How? Always waiting in the wings for a rushed visit? It's because you're young. I can appreciate our love like a gift. What do you give me? You have your patients all day and your wife at night. My best moments are with you. And mine are with you. But I'm so lonely! My life is scattered moments of bliss that I have to piece together. I dreamed of a life that was all one piece. You understand? A real life. Unbroken. You always say that. It's not my fault. Or yours, darling. My life was set in stone years ago. I'm encircled, entrapped, tied down, worn out. I walk... but never get anywhere. You've been my joy for two years. You say you love me. - I do, but I'm not happy. - Be patient. Why? Will you leave your wife? When Father dies, I'm selling. I'll move to Paris, far from this suffocating island. I want to live in a modern city with you. I have dreams too... of a new life where something happens. Unexpected, explosive things. Speaking of explosive, our neighbor attacked my staff. What do you make of that? - Nothing. And Father told me yesterday... “You neglect me because I can't move. I have no one to talk to. I'll end up talking to myself, or singing, or writing.” I'll end up... talking to myself... or singing... or writing. When I die, you'll all be dead. I'm the oldest... but I'm also the strongest! Are you mute too? No, we can chat if you like. This land is so flat. Sometimes I fear the rising sea will cover everything. How grim! You from Paris? “You hoofed it from Paris? The city the fairest?” Nice poem. Did you write it? No, a friend did. I just write stories. Tell me one in horse. I forget them all once I send them off. And the new one is still too fuzzy to tell. - Then I'll go. - Don't be mad. Fine, I'll stay. What's it about? A guy who controls people from afar with a remote control device. But his power only lasts a minute. How strange. He's a sort of evil spirit. Nothing human or even animal about him anymore. Cat got your tongue? Am I not speaking horse? Sorry, pal. Once I get going, it turns into a monologue. Don't look at me like that. My wife is mute. Sometimes she looks at me the same way, like it was my fault. See you. It's a fascinating French novel. So you understand French? No, it's a translation. My wife and I... are reading a French book too. But it's not a novel. It's a book of philosophy. That's too serious for me. I like entertaining books. I do too. But I'm also interested - AM I INTERRUPTING? Never. I love your visits. When you go, I get back to it. I'm making progress. The batteries are working. But their power only lasts a minute. MY LOVE Could you do me a favor? Give this to the linen salesmen. It's money I owe them. I believe this is theirs too. - Very well. Thanks. I'D RATHER YOU WENT ALONE. PLEASE. Why? It'll be a good program. The astronaut who orbited in space. And there's a musical first. All right. Stay here if you like. I'll be back in a flash. Watch this. You were right. It's comfy here. We're snug as two bugs in a rug. We get a lot of families in summer. - I'll bring mine. - You have children? - No. - Neither of us is married. We're married to sheets and linens. We like what's new and exciting. - And a bit of carousing. Do you need anything? We're just fine. The set menu looks perfect. Check, please. I wanted to see you before going home. Busy? Not terribly. Mostly market people. I feel calmer now. Perhaps you could come back a bit later? - Our Woodsman! - Just returning this to you. A beer, please. You can keep your piece of metal. Good evening. What's this object no one wants? Offer it to me and I'll gladly accept. A woman never refuses gifts from a nice man. You said it! Every woman likes a present. - A woman undertaken... - ...is a woman taken. It's the thought that counts. Get lost... all you old creeps and schnooks! Two is all it takes for a good time. I'm sure it's that object! Wait. Look. Is she your wife? - Leave her alone. - Everyone calm down! Don't cry. Come on, we'll work it out. Get out! Simon? - Yes, ma'am? Close everything up. And see if my father needs anything. What a number! Something's fishy! Look at this object. It's like it's full of evil. Where does it come from? Think! We have to stop it! Everything's rotten. There's decadence everywhere. Why fight it? Good night. Your move. You win. You win. The winner puts it away. The fire's smoking. It's stinging my eyes. I'm going to work a bit before bed. Okay by you? It's coming together. The guy orders the girls around. They work for him. No one has a clue. They're under his control for a minute. They turn nasty. But the protagonist has figured it out. Now he needs to find the guy. He has a lead. Am I boring you with my creatures? Tomorrow we'll take a walk. We'll see people. “To say what?” We don't have to talk. Can... not... make love with everyone.” Shall I invite one of your girlfriends? Or someone from here? I met the hotel proprietress. Fine lady. I met the doctor too. “Have him come.” You don't feel well? What? Are you serious? Really? My sweet love! Tell me! When? July... August... November... He'll be a Sagittarius! Or she will. I'll tell the doctor tomorrow. Very clever of you. Girls! I have some errands for you. If you do them well... next week I'll give you real gold crowns. Oh yes! Suzon! Here. Come here. Listen to me. You and Dani, slip these in their pockets. Be nice and do as I say. I'm nice too. Careful! Are the crowns inside? Run along, girls. Put everything inside. You can go. Here. I work too hard? Yes, but I enjoy it. Piecing it together, mystery and science fiction. I'm right in the thick of it. We're going to have a baby. I have dozens. But congratulations anyway. - Thanks, old pal. - Not old. Just one year. It's a human figure of speech. You speak rabbit well. No accent at all. See you. ASK THE DOCTOR IF THE BABY MIGHT BE MUTE. Are you mute? Where have you been all day? - With Dani. - Where? Riding in the woods. I hate you roaming around like that. Help me clean mussels. I don't want to. We need vinegar. The chef forgot to order more. We have sole today. Want one? Good idea. Suzon, go get a sole. - She's grown. - She's unbearable! And she hates Mr. Piccoli. Says he's a nut. I think he's nice. He helped me with a very rude customer. So I heard. About some piece of metal? Maybe. Put it all on my tab. Speak of the devil. Me? I'm an angel. - What do you need? - Wool. Light-blue knitting yarn. For my wife. You choose the yarn. And needles too. Say, do you know the man in that tower? - Mr. Ducasse? - What does he do? He's a retired engineer of independent means. He received some crates earlier. - Probably books. - They say he's a scientist. A long-time widower. Married to his books. Well, thanks for the yarn and the local report. Will you...? Will do. - I didn't know he was married. - Me neither. He's always alone. What are you doing? What do you know about Mr. Ducasse? Nothing. - I saw you around there. - Don't tell my morn! - Why do you go there? - I go with Dani. - What for? - I promised not to tell. Why? Morn! - What's going on? - He's grilling me. - About what? - Dani and me. Stop this nonsense. Let's go home. Such an awkward age. Let's walk back together. I trust you after the other night. I've trusted nothing since then. I want some explanations. What's the use? - I need help. - For a job? - I don't know. - We need you too. Birds of a feather... - ...flock together. Feel this quality, ma'am! Our job is next Friday, and we need another guy. - If I can help... - Is one-fifth okay? - What's the job? - Don't worry. We'll help you too. And you give us half. Okay? Okay, but I need you right away. We leave with the afternoon tide. Then after lunch at my place. We'll need rope and tools. So we're agreed. You break a window on the veranda. He comes down. We go around the other side. You stall him. Play dumb. Easy for you. - What if he locks the door? - We'll see. What are we swiping? - Swiping? - Aren't we breaking in? No, only breaking through. Like that. Funny guy. So you're settling a score? - What do you want? - Information. What evil are you planning? - We all do evil. At least I admit I enjoy it. I'm proud of it! I can do as I like with you. If you're so curious, watch this. Fight it! So that's what it is! I don't understand, but I've seen enough. See you around. Don't forget: next Friday at 10:00... if you haven't gone mad. That guy scares me! Not me. It's about willpower. You're right. Sit down. Let's get down to business. You're looking for answers and a fight? Fine. I propose an unusual but honest battle. You against me. But if you lose, you'll suffer. I'll destroy your wife. - You know about her? I know everything. I enjoy destruction. Not me. I'll fight you. Then let's start. One die each. Mine moves my trap. Yours moves your characters. Look closely at these cards and these characters. You know them already, or you will soon. They're yours. Bring them to life. Make them meet, talk, seek happiness. I'll attempt to wreck it all. See this chessboard? That's where you'll move your creatures. Michele Quellec, at the hotel. You know her. Viviane Quellec, her sister, arriving on vacation. Lucie de Montyon, young wife of an aristocrat purchasing an estate. Mrs. Velini, terrifying and seductive. - The grocer and her daughter Suzon. - You consider her a grown woman? Of course! She's 14. A charming temptress. Now the men. Dr. Etienne Desteau. Salesman Max Picot and partner Pierre Roland. And Jean Modet, an Italian electrician... working on the island for three months. Rene' de Montyon, the newlywed aristocrat. And old Mr. Quellec. My trap. I position it right in the middle of the board. It moves diagonally, while the creatures move vertically and horizontally. The action appears on this screen. When the luck of the die moves my trap over a character, I'll use my power to control them. Chance will not smile upon these creatures. Does it smile upon those who destroy? Every time my trap lands on a character, I'll plug in and control them for one minute. I'll destroy your work and break up your couples. I'll allow you to control your creatures as well, but just three times. If you have someone or something to save. Save? You get three supernatural chances, plus your innate faith in mankind. I get every chance for evil that fate hands me. The cards determine who you play. The die dictates how many squares they move. Don't forget: I came here to win. How do we keep score? It's a game of chess. If you can keep one couple together for the entire game, you win and go free. If you lose, your marriage will be destroyed. Let's begin! We'll hover outside of time above this sorry sample of mankind. The game of the creatures has begun. One. To move one square, push the corresponding button. The other one. “To Dr. Etienne Desteau, General Delivery. Dear Etienne, I must see you -” Two. One, two. Nothing. Your turn. - Three. - Turn a card over. It's lovely Lucie. Make her move! Morning, ma 'am. Set it in the middle so I can see it from my bed. Five. Is there a doctor on the island? My trap didn't move. Your turn. You'll see the TV installer's face. Six. Well done. - Who is he? Just a happy young man walking in the sun. And that's Viviane, Michéle Quellec's sister. A saleswoman in Paris. Loose, and game for anything. - What's this about? - I'm the electrician. Come in. Do what you need. I thought everything was working fine. Yes, everything works fine. - So why are you here? - You said to come in. You said you were the electrician, so I said come in. That's all. That's what I said. I'm putting in a TV next door. They need a TV? They have each other. Some couples don't know how to have fun. - Do you? - Very well. You're a very likable electrician. You're not so bad yourself. - Then We're on? - We're on! Everything's fine. I still haven't used my trap. I'm bored. Your turn. Five. - Two. Nothing. - Luck's not with you. I don't need luck. I have power. The doctor. I like him. Five. Another encounter. - I was a fool to agree to meet. - I have to talk to you. You said it all the other night with your behavior. What humiliation! - That wasn't me. Well, something within you was aroused or awoken. I'm not a whore. Spare me. I'm leaving. Wait! Can I use my power to fix this? You have that option. I love you truly. How can I believe you? You want proof? I'll wait as long as it takes. I already wait for you every day. I don't grumble about your wife or kids. Look how handsome you are. Our secret affair is worth it. I'm happy. You're beautiful as a pine forest, with the serene face of a conqueror. You smell better than fresh-baked bread. - You're crazy! - Just happy. Hold me tight. I've never been so happy. Really? Really. You're my first love. You exaggerate. My first great love. Seriously? You've fallen for this old man's last amorous gasp? You're young. And handsome. We have our whole life ahead of us. Perfect! Charming! Stupid! You've never said such things to me. I never dared. I have to go. Father's ill. Come by tomorrow? Of course. Good night, darling. We'll spend a day together in Nantes soon. My turn. Two. Still nothing! But my chance will come. One. I saw him laughing in a hotel window. Shall we put you by the TV, sir? No, thanks. By the window, so I can watch people go by. He owns the hotel. Father of Michéle and Viviane. Closer! Simon, bring me a vermouth. Right away, sir. One. Here we go! Now for a little fun. Pick it up! What's wrong, boy? Dizzy spell? My vermouth, quick! Foun My little friend. And his partner in crime. Here we go. Where's that guy who's supposed to help us? - Probably on his way. - Gimme that. Damn him! He promised! I did promise. Not even sure why. It's now or never. Our little aristocrat is paying for his estate today. The notary will have a wad of cash. You finish loading. I'll take the van. We'll meet in the bar. One! I can move left or right. - Going after the Montyons? - They'll get theirs later. I prefer to spoil your friends' reconciliation. Michéle and her country doctor. Strip like you did for that guy. Undo your blouse. Etienne, stop it. Do as I say. Unbutton that slutty blouse. Have you gone mad? Now! Or I'll slap you and dump you! Stop this ridiculous game or I'll go! Strip, baby. Put up a fuss and I'll whip your hide till it's raw. What's going on? No? Then I'll ring. Simon will see his boss turning tricks. He'll tell your father, who might even kill you! - Don't do that. - Then strip! Now! Take off your skirt. Anyone in there? Is that you, madame? Anyone there? I'll get the key. - ls their affair over? - I think so. A minute of scorn is poison to lovers. Your turn. How about a break? Play the rest first. You have three left. Finish this first round. Roll! Three. Three? She doesn't encounter anyone. Morn! I have a good idea, if I can trap her. Four to trap Suzon. Foufl Now she'll have some fun. Three. One... two... three. Viviane Quellec. Perfect. The two sisters. Simon, a Coke and some olives. - The easy life! - I'm on vacation. And rm paying- That was Father's idea. He doesn't want you here in August, the only time we're full. Any other time would be free. - I know. But I like to see people, and I like paying here. It bugs you and Dad. Think again! He's happy if money's coming in. He even put the repairs on hold. He's afraid the contractor will cheat him. But I feel awful about it. - The repairs? No! About you paying! But I'll fix the bill. You take all this so seriously. And you're so frivolous. No, I've behaved this year! Just one little crush. The electrician. I know. But be careful. He's a tease... and a liar. He's more fun than your doctor. I don't care if he's a scoundrel. I like him, he likes me. We have a good time. Maybe. I Anyway, it's all over with Etienne. It all went sour. See? Nothing lasts. Three years is something. Three days or three years. Since nothing lasts... might as well have fun. It's not fun when nothing goes wrong. Your turn. Pierre Roland. He's the only one left. Five. He doesn't encounter anyone. He's following someone. The cashier. THE SAILOR'S GETAWAY A half bottle. How's business? The usual. The stores, the market, the notary. Did you tell my aunt I'm here? There she is. Hello, Auntie. How are you? - Fine, and you? - Fine, thanks. Give me a push. Hurry. We'll meet there. Don't set out too soon. It's going smoothly. My trap doesn't move. But they don't have the money yet. They're not through. My first round's over. I played the 12 cards. How about a little break? Okay, let's go. We need to shuffle the cards to determine the order. - I haven't gone yet. - Sorry. Two. Nothing special. Move the sidekick. He joins Pierre. Your crooks make quite a pair! We look like real campers! A little music and we're all set! We're not out of the woods yet. Here's your music! We'll need an hour to out through. We got the key, not the combination. If only it weren't welded to the van! Get the gloves from the car and help me, stupid! Bye, Auntie. Where's my key? He'll call the police. They'll be caught. I promised to help. Sure, use your second minute. It's fun watching you help those bunglers. I promised. If only we had the combination. - It can't be that hard. - I say it starts with nine. Five, as in high five. Seven, as in seventh heaven. We spin it three times... and... We did it! We got to split it up! Later! We got to get out of here, fast! And hide the equipment. Throw it all in the water! You're crazy! We could use it again! You're right! I'm crazy happy! All this dough's making me crazy! Don't get carried away. What's money anyway? Just paper that can go up in smoke in a moment! My turn now. The trap is above them, and your minute's over. Stop it, you fool! Give me that money! You'll pay for this, you thief! Come back or I'll shoot! I have a weapon too: patience! Max, stop! See how well I play? I didn't force him. Is he dead? He killed him after just one minute in my control. I'm happy now. - So he's dead? - Yes. Should we go on even after a death? Yes. It's your fight. That's the game. Don't forget: Your wife is at stake. Three. The lovers. Bingo] Your champions. The only ones untouched so far. - Are you staying long? - Till the end of August. - And then? - Back to Paris. Maybe I could work in Paris. Work is the same everywhere. - True. - We could see each other. We could. Would you like that? Definitely. But I never make plans. Damn it! If only I could trap them! Three. No luck. Your move. Two. Good! Mr. Quellec, how are you? I'm laid up, but I'm still alive and kicking! Business is good. Yes, not bad. What's new, Henriette? Here we go! My trap's on you, Henriette. Don't hold back. - What are you doing? - Looking at you. I enjoy seeing you crippled. How dare you! I'm older than you! Yes, you're old. You've disgusted me forever. - Why bring up the past now? - Why not? I was just 16. I didn't dare say a word. You were married, already old. I was scared and innocent! - Shut up! I'll speak my mind! You took advantage of me. Now I'm a respected woman. And you're a nasty old man who's dying. Everyone hates you. Michéle loves me! She wants you dead. And Viviane doesn't care. They just want your loot. You'll rot in hell! Help! He fell. Madame, your father fell! Call the doctor. That's dangerous at his age. I had no idea. Not that. Go on. - The same again. - I'll be right back. Three. My move. Here we go. What took so long? I was gonna split. I'm sick of it here. Then let's go somewhere else. Nothing matters to me... but love. - Don't make me laugh! - You're the same. Me? You're loony! You just took my money, but you still love me, don't you? I don't care if you're a thief. I can always find money. But I prefer love... when I have it. You're right. Shall I burn it? - No! Split it. You still win. Nothing doing. Here. Seems I'm winning. They're hanging on. They disgust me! I didn't see that coming. My fault. But they have to make it to the end. You go home so early. There's lots to see here. I'm tired. Certain places your husband likes to go might interest you. He'll show me in time. - I wouldn't be so sure. - Why not? I saw his car on the way here. You should go see. It's a beautiful spot. - Is it a garden? - A little house. He hasn't told you? With a little front yard. Who lives there? You think he's still there? Is it really nearby? The last house in the village. Good-bye. Want my bike? It'll be faster. - Thanks. This can't go on. I won't be coming back. I'm no longer yours. Farewell. What's gotten into you? I don't know. I must go. Where? Why use your power? How does it help? See? He's running. He'll catch her and explain. She'll understand. They're so in love. - If he catches her. You can make him run... but not turn him into a rabbit. And you only have one minute. One couple is holding on. You haven't won yet. I might win, but I'm so tired. How are you feeling? How to Raise Your Child. Sorry I'm not as happy as you. I'm tired. Come with me for a walk. Won't you try, just to please me? What are you doing here? - I'm meeting someone. - Who? Mr. Ducasse? Why ask if you already know? He said he'd open the door at 10:00. He's never late. You'd better go home. You were dreaming. I rolled a six. No good. You drew Michéle's card. Play. Foun She encounters Suzon. Where's Simon? Do me a favor. Take some water up to my father. Hurry. And find Simon for me. - One. The old man. - Again? Your trap's out of control. - It's about time. It hasn't gotten much action. Come in. It's about time. I've been waiting an hour. Simon's not around. Where's that loafer now? I don't know. Push my bed. You're the only one around. Come on. Push, you little idiot! I can't! How will I get out? What's your rush? Sit there and be quiet. Let me out! - Not this. - Let me play. My minute's not up. This game's gone on long enough! I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK. PLEASE GET THE DOCTOR. Yes, I'm back, darling. I'll get the doctor now. Go lie down. Do you feel relaxed? You're okay? May I use the phone? Noirmoutier 17, please. Please hurry! Is this the big day? Doctor, is that you? Can you come quickly to the fort? My wife's going into labor. Let me know if you need anything. I'll come see her, if she likes. I love babies, and I'm lonely here. I plan to leave when Father dies. He's getting worse. But I didn't mean to keep you. Oh, did you hear the news? Mr. Ducasse, the engineer, committed suicide. Why? The police found a letter in his study off the veranda. Simon, go get the newspaper. His study was a little round room full of books. He left the letter on a table. He wrote... “I'm tired of life. I'm too lonely. Good-bye to a select few.” He jumped from his tower at least three days ago. A local man saw the shattered veranda. The body was lying there as if in a coffin of broken glass. I saw some broken glass too, but I'd never met Mr. Ducasse. He rarely spoke to anyone. We know of no family or friends to notify. It's horrible. What was the house like? Suzon had a key, so Simon and I went this morning. He had so many books in that little round room. And the veranda was filled with toys, costumes, and dolls. Suzon took a doll. She was crying. Quite a story. Keep me posted. I will. Thanks. Are you all right? I'M NOT AFRAID. I HOPE I'LL BE BRAVE. Happy? Your work's nearly done. - Yes, I finished my novel. - Not you. I meant your wife. - What are you up to? - I want nylons. Put those things back. Maybe this winter, if you study hard this last year. Hello, ma'am. I just spoke with your son Simon. I've decided to keep him on this winter, despite what I said before. He's a hard worker and very helpful. I'll put him to good use. I'll only be firing the cook. He costs me more. But Simon will have to sleep at the hotel so he can lock up at night. One needs a man in a hotel. Discuss it with your husband, since Simon's a minor. He'd like to do it. And I'll give him a raise at Easter. All right. See you soon. He'll eat well, of course. I'll spoil him. There's time for that in winter. Edgafl It hurts! Doctor, tell me... There. It's a boy.
