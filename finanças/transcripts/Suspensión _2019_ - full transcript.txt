THE PATH THAT CONNECTED THE VAST AMAZONIAN JUNGLE TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WAS THE MOST UNUSUAL AND TERRIBLE THING THAT CAN BE IMAGINED. IT WAS LIKE IF AN EVIL SPIRIT HAD FUN SPREADING PRECIPICES AND CANYONS TO PREVENT ACCESS TO THAT SOLITARY NATURE. FRIAR CANET DEL MAR CAPUCHIN MISSIONARY (1924) SUSPENSION It looks there are three! This is a very sad news. A river of mud near Murallas, on the road that connects Pasto to Mocoa, carried 8 vehicles, 2 buses, several jeeps and an ambulance. So far, 20 bodies have been found. It is assumed that about 70 people were circulating on the road. I was working. - Are you a driver? - Yes, sir. - Do you always work on this road? - Yes, all the time. Why they call it the "Springboard of Death"? Well, because this road is very dangerous. And it is so bad in some places that you are always risking your life. Would you like to ask something to the government? We would like the government to hear us and build the Mocoa-San Francisco road, because this is a disaster. - A graveyard? - Yes, sir. Is it difficult to work with this zip line? Yes, but we are providing a service to the community. Aren't people afraid? Yes, very afraid. But it is the only way to cross the landslide. Are you scared, boy? Yes! And you? Are you afraid? No, sir. Well, there goes the zip line! Keep your head down. Finally, the road was opened on July 30, 1991. Since then, we've constantly monitoring any crack that may appear and that can indicate new landslides. This is the beginning of the rural section of the road that goes to Putumayo. To be more exact, the Pasto-Mocoa section. This stretch constantly lives in construction, made by contractors from the National Roads Institute. A rural taxi in full activity. Subhuman conditions for passengers. Accident on the stretch between kilometers 46 and 47, just before La Palanca. It wasn't serious. The road to Mocoa... The terrain is very steep. It was built more than 30 years ago and has never undergone maintenance. Note that the road is very narrow and there is a rock formation on the left. Stretch Buenos Aires. Face to face with a truck. Is it a two-way road? I ask... The stretch of Los Monos... Road to Mocoa... A slide of stones, which descended from the mountainside. A steep slope with large amounts of biomass in the upper area... Once again, we see the roadbed, and a part of the lower slope... showing signs of a precipice. Unfortunately, clouds prevent a more detailed view. Traffic conditions on this stretch of climb to El Mirador... Jeep reversing. We are about... 30, 40 meters from the top. We are at the top of the mountain. Stop the car, please! The Amazonian plains, that resemble the sea. Zones with high risk of landslides. Observe the abyss below. The contractor's jeep... and the road, seen in the direction of Mocoa, capital of the Department of Putumayo. How are we, Guillermo? It is one o'clock in the afternoon. We are 32 km from... San Francisco. You got what you wanted, didn't you? After all, we must thank the Lord God. In 1985, I wanted to be a road engineer. I started to get involved with politics... hoping the Ministry of Public Works to hire me for a position with jurisdiction and control. Because? So that I could speak directly about southern Colombia, and, in particular, on the Pasto-Mocoa road. Capuchins built the route for horses in two years, employing an average of 1,400 workers per day. In two years! While this road, a completely different route... lasted for approximately 10 years... before a truck could travel over it. If we analyze the characteristics of the road geometry, which includes 18 turns per kilometer, it becomes even more obvious that the only possible conclusion is that this work was crazy. It was an emotional and political madness. What happened to Mocoa? And with Putumayo? This dirt road was the only communication between Pasto and the national road system. It was the umbilical cord. What would have been the best route for the road? Without a doubt, the horse trail left by Capuchins, which is what is being built today. The San Francisco-Mocoa road. CONSTRUCTION OF THE SAN FRANCISCO- MOCOA ROAD IS IN PROGRESS! TOTAL INVESTMENT: US$ 116,000. Are we there? Yesterday, I told him to have coffee, but he ran. Really? Yesterday, he was scared. He made a fool of himself so he could wake up late. He came here and pretended he was scared not to get scolded. That's what you think, asshole. Am I an asshole? Did you hear what he said? It will get wet there. Not in this place. Put next to the shovel. It's good that this stone is not hard. Let's put this a little further here. We will use to fill here. Having coffee again? ...the actual number of deaths is not known, but we managed to find the bodies of 51 people. - The bodies... - Yes, the bodies. All dismembered... The whole situation was horrible. It was raining a lot, and, as we cleared the place, the slide started to descend again and covered us. We are talking about the natural disaster, the massacre caused by the terrible landslide of 1991, 26 years ago! You said that even before that, the San Francisco-Mocoa road was already under discussion. - Then we wasted 26 years, sir? - Much more than that. Many other disasters have occurred as a result of this neglect, this abandonment by the state. The "Springboard of Death" it's the most dangerous road in the world. That's true? That's what they say. This is not a road. Not at all. It is a path. It has a track for both directions. And the tragedies do not stop. Buses fall, jeeps fall... The tragedy will never end until the San Francisco-Mocoa road is built. Well, the FARC no longer exists, paramilitary groups no longer exist, but Putumayo continues to suffer from an even worse aggressor, which is the "Springboard of Death". Who is responsible for these deaths? Exactly. We asked truck drivers... what they would consider fair compensation for the victims of this road. They said: "Finish the San Francisco-Mocoa road!" That would be fair compensation for the people of Putumayo and Nariño! - Have a nice day. - Goodbye. When they started talking about this road, we were very happy. My daughter was happy, because my granddaughter, who was 3 at the time, could study in Mocoa or San Francisco. But time passed and we only saw surveyors and other people coming here to drill, other people looking at tunnel construction... The first route followed that path, down there. Now they say they are going to build a tunnel here, that would end 100 meters ahead. Then they cleaned up another section. Then another surveyor came and designed another route... about 50 meters above the first. And the last route they planned, almost a year ago, passes about 100 meters below our house, where we see that field over there. I'm fighting not to put the road there, because... it will destroy my place. I asked for it to be further down. They say they’re going to build big concrete walls, about 30, 40 meters down the road for horses. At this rate, I estimate it will take another 100 years to complete, because there are so many lies... I've been here for 34 years, and the outlook is not good. Although the governor and the others say it will be completed... My granddaughter and I will be underground and nothing will have changed. I don't believe the lies of these bastards. What homework do you have for tomorrow? Of English. English? My goodness... Thanks. I'll fix your hair... You don't have to take it apart. I want to put it aside. Good... Let's start from here. The Three Wise Men, right? Didn't you forget the Egyptian kings? Esau, and who was the other? That yellow part. - Look how beautiful! - I want to see. That is the road! See how beautiful! I think that is a bridge. It looks like a bridge. What will it be? "San Francisco, kilometer..." It will be beautiful. Look at that! It looks like the roads of Manizales. "Bridge 19"... Where do you think it is? It starts at kilometer 13, plus 720... Our fields are not like that. It doesn't look like our region. Look at these trees! Where will this curve go? Must be the famous viaducts! DANGER ROAD UNDER CONSTRUCTION One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... Is good. This is missing... This is missing... Two of these are missing, and the number 30... Three of number 30. It can't be that much. Let's interleave. Then put it there... When the others arrive, have them assembled and fixed here. What? Should have gone that way. But it's here. Right here. What was the length? Two at the back, two and a half, and then the rebars. There must be five behind. Five behind... and place them closer to the rebars. We will have to get rid of these vibrating scales. It is not your fault. There is no other way to do it. Not much is left. About a concrete bucket, but the other mixer is here. Did you see? How much? Place on Axis number 2... Closer! To the number 2! Number 2! Bring it closer to the rebars. Closer to the rebars! Seven centimeters back. Seven centimeters back! No! Go back to the prism! Go back to 35! Go back to 35 and back to the prism! Put on 35, and go back to the prism. When you read Putumayo's story, it's very sad. But if you dwell on that sadness, everything goes wrong. From a technical point of view, there are no limits. Everything is possible. But something is not working right, and this thing ends up referring to ancestry, because it passes from generation to generation. In the end, they took everything away. Most of us lost our jobs. I mean, everyone. They started by firing 10 people at a time. There were no more guards. They stopped working. As people say, money was thrown away, because they never ended the road. Everything stopped, the works in the ditches, the workers' contract... They say the money is gone. They dismissed the workers, suspended the works. They even took the machines away. They didn't even leave the trash behind. They took everything away. They padlocked the entrance so that no one can access the bridge. Two gates were placed. I managed to open one of the gates. That way, at least the people can come in and admire the bridge, right? They can see the view. Who's going to be dumb enough to jump off the bridge? A lot of people come here on Saturdays and Sundays... Let them access the bridge for a walk! ROAD CLOSED On fourth generation roads, the goal is to avoid turns. But that doesn't make sense, because they didn't even finish... This is suicide. This road goes up there... Go around the mountain. It doesn't matter if your dad is in the picture! You need to photograph the bridge! Like this. You can see? How beautiful all this green... It is a great place to do bungee jump. - It's scary! - I would jump. Sure. The Juanambú Bridge is higher, and people jump from it. - Seriously? - Sure. I hope they finish building the road. I hope for that. Such an imposing bridge to end up on the mountain! Our teacher said that when the bridge is finished, the tunnel will begin. From here on, the terrain is very steep. Come here, dear! It's raining! Let's go. ROAD CLOSED Will they ever finish this road someday? I may be dead before they're done. It's difficult. They say it will be completed in the next 10 years, but until then, I will be underground. It won't do any good. But life is like that. MARCH 31, 2017 This is how things are. Come in, Coqui. Attention, Putumayo! The Los Pinos stream overflowed, and houses are being flooded. Residents are climbing on the roofs. Please help! This is an appeal to the relief agencies, to the mayor! Everything is flooded! Help! We need a helicopter! ON THE NIGHT OF MARCH 31, 2017, MOCOA WAS DESTROYED BY RAIN. ROAD ENGINEER GUILLERMO GUERRERO URRUTIA IT WAS AMONG THE HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS WHO DIED THAT NIGHT. THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SAN FRANCISCO-MOCOA ROAD WAS SUSPENDED MONTHS BEFORE THIS TRAGEDY. THE PEOPLE OF PUTUMAYO CONTINUE USING THE "SPRINGBOARD OF DEATH", IN OPERATION SINCE 1944.
