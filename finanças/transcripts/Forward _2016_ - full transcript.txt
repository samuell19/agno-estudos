FORWARD Related to the future... Your problem is that you’re new to this. New? No. It’s called style. Style is a different thing... Come on! You have your way to kill... ...I have my own. What's the problem? How many? In your life? I don't have a clue... ...20, 30? My count is 68. Seriously? So this guy is gonna be your 69th? Yes. Damn freak. Want one? We have like 15 minutes. Do you have more info? No. He's called “The Wizard” and... ...he messed up with the boss's girlfriend. Let's go... Let's go. Is that gonna last all night? Told you I was hungry. What is it? Just a video. It’s fake. That’s not fake! She’s crying like hell. And what’s with all the blood? It's fake. She's acting. She's shaking but she's not hyperventilating. What are you laughing at, asshole? You don't even know that word. She's hyperventilating. It's when your heart pumps faster than... ...you can handle and in two minutes you faint. I know the word... It's just that... ...sometimes you're a smart ass. This place looks... ...like those haunted houses, right? There are no such places, pussy. I believe there are. Marisela once told me she saw things. You should have changed your tie. Here we go! I picked you up. Remember? So it means I got dressed first. You should change yours. We look like Travolta and the other guy. What's his name? Who? “The Matrix” guy? No, no, no. We are dressed like the guys in “Pulp Fiction.” ...[B]ut in this case... ....you're the black guy and I get to fuck Uma Thurman. He didn't fuck her. - Of course he did... ...after the dance, the hamburgers... It's implied. We aren’t going that way, are we? Afraid? No. I’m not afraid. Well, now we know where to go. What was that? Just something with wings. No guards. No cameras. Weird, isn't it? I don't think this is a "safe house." I don't think he hangs out here very often. But that stench is for real. Indeed. Hey... - What? Have you heard the rumors about this guy? They’re just bullshit. A strategy to keep enemies away. All this because of a piece of ass. She makes me think of... ...Uma Thurman if she had been in "El Rey.” ...like Helena of Troy. Come on! You've been watching too many movies. Call it depression. Just like that, bro’ Read a book. I was reading “Hellboy”... ...when he goes to the underworld... ...and he fights all the demons and... “Hellboy” doesn’t count. It's a comic. Not a book. It's literature. Depression? Marisela. Of course. How long? Eight months, one week and three days. Cheer up. Strange, isn't it? Kind of. I almost shot you! See that? Did you see him? No. I didn’t see anything. I shot him! Yeah. I heard. We gotta hurry up. They know we're here. You’re saying it's my fault? Well, it is. What did you want me to do? I was attacked. I don't know what the fuck you... Are you hurt? Thanks for asking. - Yes or no. No. This place is huge... We’ve gotta go up. What the fuck is this? Whatever it is, asshole, it’s very fucked up. No. One more. It’s on the third floor. But is that the way... Yes. But one floor up. Ok. Wait, wait, wait... Let's go! It's nothing, stupid! You scared the shit out of me! Damn! - I thought it was... ...somebody. Wait. Something's wrong with my gun. Let me see. What the fuck... ...[B]ut in the meantime... ...let's kill that... ...motherfucker... and take Uma Thurman with us. Who is Uma Thurman? The boss's girlfriend. Larissa? How do you know her name? I've heard it a couple of times. Do you understand it? It's like a comic book. It’s ancient. What was that? I don't know. Let's get the hell out of here. Come on. Marco, we gotta go! Now! Did you close the door? No. It wasn't me! Wait a second! Move out of the way! - Ok. My turn! Go! - My gun is dead! Fuck! I'm gonna find another way in. Who’s there? Who’s there? Answer me! Baby? Marisela? Marisela? Do you like...? Why did you go? Where have you been? Do you love me? More than you can imagine. And even more than that. You killed me! You killed me! No... No. I didn't kill you! No. I didn't kill you! I didn't kill you! I didn't kill you! It was an accident. It was an accident! I didn't pull the trigger. Baby...do you love me? You are not her. You are not her. No. You are not her. Don't leave me. I need you. No. You are not her. It can't be you. Please forgive me. I'm sorry. Marisela. My love. I'm sorry! You can kill me again, my love. I didn't kill you. Marco! Marco! Let's go! Marco! Laura? Laura? Tomas... What do you want? I want you. Marco! Come on! Move! Move! Let's go! Marco! We need to get out of here. The front is blocked. We are being hunted. By who? Larissa. Larissa. The boss's girl? Yes. I've seen her a couple of times... ...and I'm sure it’s her. It's not her. These are demons. Here... Every time I try to get away... ...there's one of them. There's one at the entrance... ...and two women. The one we just saw is not the same one I saw earlier. What? For a moment I thought I saw Marisela. I held her... I touched her... I talked to her... No, Tomas... It's just like me seeing my sister... It’s not real. Nothing that happens here is real. How's your mag'? Let's move out. Good afternoon, gentlemen. It's been a long time since we had guests around here. Are you okay? Don't move, dickhead. Don't move. This kind of violence will not be needed... I guess you're the ones that came to kill me? Right? I feel flattered. El Albino went and sent... ...his best. What is this all about? All this... It would take too long to explain what all this is about. Truth is... ...you don't have that much time. I believe you've already met Larissa. How charming she is. Is she? - No, Tomas... ...Tomas, she's not... - El Albino sent us. You have to come with us. Let's go. Let's go now. You don't know who I am. This is a friendly version of me... for you. For a second, I thought your boss would have the guts to show up himself and save his girlfriend... Damn! I guess he fooled me this time. What do you want from us? Who? Me? Nothing that I don’t already have. But, truth is that our boss... ...is a little bit more ambitious. Isn't he? All because of a woman? - No. I'm just the bait to catch a certain kind of man. Try to picture me as an evangelist. But I don't like going door to door. In other words... ...we are all on the same team. But this time you're going to lose. I guess you are familiar with the phrase "Being... ...disposable.” You've got that right. It's gonna take a while for you to understand it. What do you want from us? Nothing. We already have it all. But there are some rules, gentlemen. Were you looking for...it? What's that? Now’s your chance. They are armed. No, baby. It’s not for them. It’s for you. The deal was not... - The deal's changed. You want it all... Now show me. That delicious smell of fear... Larissa... I just can't... Run! Run! Which way? - I don't know...to the left. My leg! - Watch out... ...Let's go! Run! Run! Smile. Evil is watching you. Hello? Hello! Hello? It’s not real! It's not real. Did you have fun with your little sister? We have enjoyed her a lot. You have to kill her... I missed! What do you want? Marco! Hey! Hey! It has to be here... Somewhere... Pulp fiction. Did you get it? There's no exit. It's like a loop. You have to kill her. I missed!
