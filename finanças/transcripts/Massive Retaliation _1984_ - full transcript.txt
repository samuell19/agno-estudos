This gung-ho diplomacy has, many observers feel, gone beyond a point where either side can gain any bargaining chips with the OPAC nations. In a related development, Pope John Paul II issued a statement today from the Vatican, urging both the President and the Soviet Premiere to take any steps necessary to avert escalation of the situation. - [Secretary] There's a kid for you on line two. It's not Harry. - Junior or senior? I think it's Eric Briscoe. He's taking the kids up to the cabin a day early, get them out from underfoot. School vacation. I'll take it. Hello, Eric. - Hello? - Is there something interesting on the wire? - I'm not sure. I was just about to take it into the boss. - I'll take it. May I see? Thank you. - Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Tolliver, but Harry forgot his backpack. - All right. I suppose his head is still attached. - Yes, ma'am, but it rattles. - [Jackie] How are the rest of the kids? - Yeah, we're fine, but I think everybody in the world left early for Fourth of July weekend. - (sighs) Well, all right. I will bring the backpack, and you drive safely, and I'll see you tomorrow. - [Eric] You want to talk to your son? - No. No need. I'll see you tomorrow. (reporter chattering) (ominous music) Hello?

Western newsmen have been quarantined in the American Embassy in Moscow, but it's expected they will be released shortly. - [Kirk] Hi, fill it up unleaded, please. - Got to be cash in advance. - Okay, how much? - $20 a gallon. - The sign says a buck 44. - Oh yeah, that was yesterday, today it's $20 a gallon. - That's illegal. You can't charge more than the posted price. - Okay, so arrest me. Now do you want the gas or don't you? - [Lois] Give him the money, honey. If things keep escalating like this, they'll just be scraps of paper. - I haven't seen the others, Doc. The kids came through a couple hours ago. They stopped just long enough to fill up their radiator. Your son's getting big. - He's a good boy. - Clark's, Wanda, let's move it. Jack's sausage is getting cold. - Oh yeah? That little thing? Jack's sausage has been cold for years. - Shot you down, sucker. - In flames. - It's okay, Wanda. This sausage is gonna rise again. - Oh yeah? Well, you'd better hurry up because the end of the world is coming. - Be coming before Jack does. - We're gonna conquer the world anyway. We're gonna kick some Russian ass. - Nuke Moscow, that'll teach them. - We ain't got the balls. - Says who. - Says 20 bucks. - Hey, shut up. Turn up the tube. - This is Jim Patton in New York. Foreign news services have reported just moments ago that American and Soviet carrier groups in the Gulf of Oman have exchanged fire. While neither belligerent government will confirm these reports, observers on the scene have reported seeing blinding flashes of light and large mushroom clouds beginning to form. - Oo-ey! - [Jim] All radio communications from the immediate area- Sh. - Have ceased. Both carrier groups are known to carry tactical nuclear weapons in the one to 15 kiloton range. This is Jim Patton in New York. - Geeze, Brady, you're a prophet. - 20 bucks, Johnny. - Screw that.

Sign said Lincoln, five miles. - Yeah, I see it. - Well, I can go on my bike and see if I can find a pump. - At 1:30? - [Eric] Maybe there's an all night gas station. - Wait until morning. - No, I'll go now. That way we'll still meet Dad and Marianne and everyone. - [Kimmy] They won't get there until afternoon anyway. - You can't trust them. Maybe they'll leave early. Then I'd really be in for it. - [Kimmy] It's not your fault. It's the dumb water pump. - Yeah? You tell dad. - Okay. Get going. - Hey, where are you going? - Yeah, where are you going? - Kimmy's in charge now until I get back. You guys listen to her, get in the van and lock up tight. I'll be back before you get up. - Is this a somber party? - Slumber party, dumbo. (gentle music) (traffic whooshing) - [Kimmy] So the big chief of the bear clan, puffed long puffs on his pipe. He stood listening for a moment to the small sounds of the night. "So," he said to his son, "You want to know how that trail of dust got in the sky?" - [Lee] We cannot risk it. - We barely got here. - Our kids didn't get here at all. - Lois, we all share your concern but we've been over this ground for hours. Let's not just sit here. Let's finish unpacking. It will take our minds off... It will give us something to do. - Honey, we'll go as soon as it's light, but Lee's right, we should stay on schedule. In fact, right now, we should be stocking the barn. - Stocking your anus. Geeze, Kirk, am I gonna have to shit on schedule? This whole thing started off as a vacation. - [Lee] But it's not. Enough talk. Let's unpack. (crickets chirping) - Jackie. Were you going to sleep in here? - Well, I thought I would. - Oh. - That's okay, I'll go to a different room. - No, no look I can move. It's just, well Lee and I used to use this room when, uh. - Oh, that's okay honey. Lots of men sleep with their secretaries. Ah. This is interesting survival gear. (both laughing) - It was a gift from Lee. I'm not sure who he thinks he married. - This would be a real good time to find out. - You and Connie were friends, weren't you? I mean, the survival thing, it was gonna be the six of you. - [Jackie] Lee can marry anyone he wants to. - And divorce anyone he wants to? - Whatever keeps him young. Look, I'll, uh, I'll find another room. - [Kirk] They could be on Highway 115 and they might have taken a shortcut, there's no way we could find them this time of the night. If the kids are here, they'll have to go all the way around. - Oh, there you are Marianne. Come out to the barn and help me, I've got to unpack the guns. - Oh Lee. No. - What do you mean? - Honey, I don't like killing. - So? Shoot to maim. It's just another survival tool, like the mines. Superior fire power will prevent anybody from even trying to take what we've got in here. Now come on out and help. - [Kirk] I can help, Lee. - Don't worry little lady. It won't come to killing. This ain't a John Wayne movie. (Marianne laughs) (crickets chirping) - [Kirk] Let me try that, Lee. - You learn that in Vietnam? - No, I wasn't in 'Nam. Picked it up in basic training. I spent six months active duty. Coastguard Reserve. Tell you the truth, I wasn't too concerned with the war one way or the other. I just kept my nose clean, did what I was told. - Glad you're in my army, boy. (crickets chirping) - [Kimmy] Freeze, I've got a gun. - Yeah, right, and I've got a laser beam. - How did it go? - I froze my butt off. There's a part store, but it's closed. I'll have to go back in the morning. - [Kimmy] It is morning. - [Eric] Don't be logical. (gentle music) - It's not the kind of thing you talk about every day. I mean, I think I can handle the idea of dying, but the idea that no one would be around afterwards. Ever. - No one? No thing. Nothing. No animals, no trees. Every living thing. (rooster crowing) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) - [Kirk] Averages out to 2500 calories each which should be more than enough for a healthy adult with vitamin supplements and freeze dried foods and hydroponic vegetables, we'll do pretty well. - It's more than pretty. - [Lois] What about the kids? - 1,800 each. - [Lois] It still sounds like rationing to me, Kirk. - [Kirk] It is, but nobody is imposing anything, it's just about consensus guidelines. (Marianne laughing) (all laughing) - [Harry] Can I have some butter? (birds chirping) - [Reporter] With unofficial evacuations reported throughout the country, particularly from areas perceived to be strategic targets, airports, military bases- - I think it's light enough. - [Reporter] Manhattan cab drivers are calling it the worst traffic jam they- - A few of us could go. - [Reporter] Have ever seen as residents pour out of the metropolitan New York area. - Let's just wait until noon and then we'll ask Lee, all right? - I thought we were gonna vote on this? - [Reporter] Refusing to call it an evacuation. - We will, but we put Lee in charge. - Will you turn that thing down? - [Reporter] Wide spread looting in Detroit, Miami and certain areas of Los Angeles. - I just thinking he's putting too much faith in a 17-year-old boy. If it was one of our sons- - Oh, that's unfair. - Well then where is he? - I don't know. (phone ringing) - Hello, Eric? - [Eric] Hello? I was looking for Susie. - Eric, this is Mrs. Fredericks, where are you? - Oh, God, is my dad there too? - Yes, we're all here, where are you? - [Eric] Look, I'm sorry, but the water pump busted. - [Jackie] How the little kids are. How are they? - [Eric] I came back on my bike to this little town. - [Jackie] Where are they? - [Eric] We had to stay overnight on the side of the road. - [Lois] Little town, what town, Eric? - [Eric] Lincoln. - [Lois] Lincoln, a town named Lincoln. - What's that? What's it near? - And there's a parts store but- - Wait, don't all talk at once. What, Eric? No, not you, honey. Eric, how are the other kids? - [Eric] They're okay. You know, they're asleep in the van, it's like a big game to them. (all chattering) - Come here immediately. Don't stop and pick up anybody, promise? - [Eric] Yeah, sure, what's up? - There's, there might be a war going on. - [Kirk] Don't tell him that. - The Americans and the Russians are fighting and it could get really bad. You know it's safe up here. Your father's put a lot of work into this. - [Eric] Yeah, I know. Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. So listen, how long will it take you to get up here? Fix the pump, and get up here? - [Eric] Oh, no time at all. - [Harry] Just tell him to come straight up. - Sh! - Come straight up. - [Eric] All I have to do is buy it. - All right, but listen. Just drive straight here, sweetie, and don't pick up anybody, all right? - Okay, bye. - And Eric? - [Eric] Yeah? - Take care of our babies. Bye-bye. - [Kirk] It's okay. - Hey, they're safe. They're safe. (all laughing) (gentle upbeat music) - Do you got a water pump for a '69 Dodge van, V8? - Morning, son. Awful early to be in such a rush, isn't it? - Yeah, well I need the pump. You got one? - What model again? - '69 Dodge van. - Be a minute or two. - Will you hurry, sir? - I didn't rush through my first 76 years, ain't too eager to rush through my next 76. - [Eric] Need helping finding it? - I didn't need any help stocking it, don't need any help finding it. Buying that too? - [Eric] No. - Looks like it's all there. - Great, that's it. - $167.95. - I'll take it. Here. - Lee Briscoe. Got any other ID? - Well, it's my father's credit card, but I have my driver's license and my school ID, see? The name's the same. I'm Eric Briscoe. My mom named me, she liked Eric. - Sorry son, names don't match. - No, no, see, my dad gave me permission. - How am I supposed to know that? We get too many phony credit cards. - Oh, come on, look. Library card, Explorer Scouts. YMCA pool. - You can pull cards until you turn vermilion, but if you don't have a card with your name on it it ain't legal tender. Besides, if there really is a war going on, what good's credit? You got any cash? - No, Megan wanted cotton candy, and then they all wanted cotton candy. And then hot dogs and then... Look, I got a van full of kids up the road and there's a war. - Son, there's been a war being fought every day somewhere in the world since World War II. Somewhere about as I start to lose interest, and by Afghanistan, I was downright apathetic. I'm not going to take- - Just sell me the pump. - Your card with your name on it. - You can call my dad. - Now how am I supposed to know who's on the other end of the line? Don't! Hold it.

Malibu, California- - Lee. - [Reporter] Lead in panic earlier today, after reports that a Russian submarine was spotted off shore. - [Lee] Okay, let's check it out. - [Reporter] Injured in a series of automobile accidents. - Jackie, back up. - [Reporter] In other news, the joint- (birds chirping) - Hi.

This is private property. - What is this? I can get the sheriff you know. - To do what? - Look, could I just come in? Mrs. Fredericks will vouch for me. - Sorry, I have to ask you to leave.

Now let's get some water and help Megan wash out her sleeping bag. - [Child] Oh, gross. (emergency broadcast alarm blaring) - The radio. Jackie! Jackie! The radio. Maybe it's the kids on the on the CB. - [Jackie] No, no, it doesn't have the range. - [Lois] Let's try, come on. - [Announcer] This is not a test. Repeat, this is not a test. - It's the AM. - [Announcer] This is the emergency broadcast system operated by the authority of the United States government, and with the cooperation of broadcasters in your area. I repeat, this is not a test. You are requested to stay tuned to this station for emergency information. Pursuant to executive order 11490, the President of the United States has authorized the implementation of the emergency broadcast systems. At 11:00 Eastern Daylight Time, the President of the United States signed an executive order declaring a national emergency. The federal emergency crisis relocation program is to be implemented immediately. This means the systematic, orderly and non-panicked relocation of our population, from urban to rural host areas. Host area destination cards are available at your local station or federal building. - Evacuation. They're evacuating the cities. - [Announcer] We now switch to you local EBS authorities, who will provide regional information on evacuation plans. - Got to hand it to you. - [Announcer] Please leave your receivers on and above all- - You've been right about this thing all the way down the line. - I'm not very proud of it. - [Announcer] Reasonably, and without panic. - [Kirk] Hey, what are you doing? - We've got to get the kids. I've looked it up on the map and there's a back road we can take to the cut off. - We can't risk it. - Risk it? What are we involved with all this for. - Lois. - What are we surviving for? Aren't we involved in this for the kids as well? - For God's sake- - I think she's right, what is the point of all of this? - Don't panic, dammit, any of you. The point is we haven't got enough information yet. What is evacuation going to do? Can we travel? What kind of fire power do we need? - We're gonna go, but first we've got to monitor the local broadcast, find out what the hell is going on out there. - [Jackie] All right, maybe I can get something on this radio. - [Reporter] Information to the Los Angeles base. The- (suspenseful music) - [Lee] Can't travel in LA on a good day, it must be hell down there now. (suspenseful music) (engine roaring) - [Marianne] No, no, stop. (dramatic music) - Where is she? - She went right through the field, toward the meadow gate. - Oh, god, the mines. Go without. - She's got all the car keys. - The old pickup truck, it's in the barn. (dramatic music) (keys beeping) (suspenseful music) - Come on, baby. Eight, four, seven, six. Don't panic. (suspenseful music) I can't turn the mine field off. - [Jackie] Do you have it? - No, get the manual. - Why did we ever decide to put mines in here anyway? - What mines? Kirk's got 'em off for sure. - It's the seven. The seven won't come up. I should have cleaned the contacts. (suspenseful music) - [Jackie] Give me this. - Alternate code, in the back section. - Can't you reprogram this? - Hurry. - [Kirk] That's what I'm trying to do. (suspenseful music) - Oh my god, Lois. - [Marianne] Oh my god. - Oh my god. (somber music) - [Harry] Son of a bitch! - Don't move her, Harry. Watch her neck. Any pain there, any pain? - No. - All right. (suspenseful music) You're all right. Can you walk? Just hang on to me now. You're okay here. - She looks okay. - At least she's walking. (Lois moaning) - Fear not, fair damsel, I shall retrieve your map. (suspenseful music) (explosion booming) - Harry! (Marianne sobbing) (pensive music) - How's Harry? - Shattered his foot and his ankle. Lee's a good doctor. He says he'll recover. The ah, what do you call it. The mine was a dud. Otherwise it would have killed him. - Yeah. - Are we doing the right thing, Kirk? (pensive music) - Ask Lee. - I know his answer. He's always certain. (gentle music) Lee was never in the service. He says he was just between wars, just too young for Korea, just too old for Vietnam. What is it, about men and war, Kirk? - I don't know. - Does every generation have to fight one? - I don't know. I don't know. - [Officer] You cooled down, kid? - [Eric] Look, I'm sorry. How long before I go to court or before I can make a phone call? - Phones don't work, priority calls only, government rule. As for a judge, I don't think you'll be needing one. - Huh? Look, I've got rights now. You've got to give me a trial. - If you insist, but I thought I'd just let you go. - What? - Hell, Wilford don't want to press charges and I ain't got time to look after you. The world's going to hell out there, you think I want to look after some kid thieving auto parts? Besides, you've got kinfolk to get to, right? - [Eric] Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - [Dispatcher] 482. - [Dispatcher] 482. - It's all here. - Want to sign this receipt? (radio chattering) - Look, there isn't any way you could make him sell me that pump, is there? - You don't ask a lot do you? Look, let me tell you something, the world may be crazy as a pig on loco weed, but that don't mean I can tell any man how to sell his property. Until the Russians get here and hang out their shingle, and got forbid I see the day, this is still America. And America means a man can sell his goods any way he chooses, all right? Now, get out of here. (phone ringing) Sheriff's office. You just sit tight, Shirley, there ain't no commies on Main Street. I don't care what the parson's wife said. I'm the Sheriff, I'd know.

Expecting trouble in town. A lot of city folk pouring in. I guess you heard there's a war on. Well, Old Swede, he sold all his gas in town, and the sheriff, well, it ain't no secret we helped you stash 1,000 gallons up here last summer. - And? - And the sheriff deputized me to come and, what you call it, appropriate some for the town emergency. - You know, I'd certainly give it to you if you had something official, but, uh, under the circumstances. - [Virgil] What the hell are you gonna do with all that gas anyway? - Son of a bitch, never did anything for this town anyway. - Shut up, Ernie. It's your last word, Doc. - A word from Sheriff Klauson might help. - He's dead. - [Virgil] Ernie, for Christ' sake, will you shut your God damn mouth. - That before or after he deputized you, Virgil? - You wait, you son of a bitch, you just hold it.

We mount a guard tonight and nobody misses weapons practice tomorrow. - Can't we negotiate? Can't we just give them some gas? - Yeah, that seems practical. - Doesn't anybody understand what we are doing here? Doesn't anybody realize why we are here? Why we're safe? - No, Lee, maybe we're stupid. - Precisely because we are not stupid. Because we were smart enough to see this coming. Smart enough to fix up a place that was isolated from major target areas and fall out patterns. Because we have our gas, our food, our guns. Because some of us had the foresight and the balls to want to survive. Can you tell me what in the hell is wrong with that? Look, (sighs) just hang together until the children arrive. - If the kids don't get here by noon tomorrow they probably won't make it. - Oh god. - Kirk. - That is not a possibility, Kirk. My son is a survivor. And unless I get more support from my troops, he'll be the only one. (announcer speaking in foreign language) - [Marianne] At least take a nap. Let me hold you, honey. - I don't need to sleep. I used to go 72, 96 hours during my internship. - [Marianne] Honey, that was almost 30 years ago. - I can still do it. If you want to sleep, go ahead. You wouldn't take a watch anyway. - Come to bed. We need to talk. You need your sleep. - On the contrary, somebody's got to stay awake. (Marianne sighs) (gentle music) - They told me I shouldn't try to have another, but God we wanted a girl. She was a broached birth, poor blue little baby. - I've thought about having babies. (laughs) But I'm afraid. - Afraid? - Of this. Exactly this. Bringing a baby into this kind of world. - Having them die from the bomb? - Having them not die. - [Kirk] Dammit. - [Announcer] Driving in Poland and strikes by soldiers and other war-torn countries. - Boy, this, Jackie, could you bring me some light over here? I can't see a damn thing. - [Reporter] Continue their- - Oh no, this disk is damaged, we should have made a backup. You never think. (gentle music) (match whooshing) - [Harry] Must be it. Must be a God damn bomb. - No, Harry. I think the lights go on, not off. Real bright light. - Very cheerful. - (laughs) Hey, we count on you for jokes. - [Reporter] From the Israeli- - Kerosene for lights. Should use electricity only for the radios and computer. - If it works. - Why shouldn't it work? - The minefield program disk is destroyed. I had to deactivate the entire system. (radio chattering) - Sorry, Kirk, but good. - The alarm system still works, but I don't know how reliable it is. - [Jackie] Shit. - [Reporter] A complete failure. (dramatic suspenseful music) (sausage sizzling) - [Kirk] Is that on the list? It's way past dinner. - No, Harry was hungry. I figure he needed his strength to heal. - Well maybe he's not gonna heal. Maybe we should start thinking about saving his portions. I shouldn't have said that. (gentle music) - I'm hungry. - [Kimmy] You're always hungry. - I'm starving. - [Eric] I told you, we're not stopping. - Why can't we stop? - [Kimmy] 'Cause Eric said so. - Harry, I've got some candy you can have. - Jackie? - Yes? - [Marianne] Could you try the kids on the CB again? - I just tried them a half hour ago. If they're not in range they're not in range. - I just thought that- - Thought what? That I'm not trying hard enough? That I'm a shitty mother. Somehow because I don't cook and because Harry and I don't get along so well. Because I spend more time at my job than at the PTA. That somehow I'm less of a wife and a mother? - I didn't say that. - Let me tell you, Lois Fredericks. I'm tired of your opinions. We were supposed to be able to have it all. Well I went and I got it. I'm tired of your jealousies and your intimations that I can't handle this. - Wait a minute. You made your choice and I made mine. - Jackie, that's what the women's movement is all about. Choices. - (scoffs) The women's movement. I'm on the God damn front lines of the women's movement. Here you are getting ahead lying on your back. (Marianne scoffs) You two want to use the radio? You go right ahead. If you can figure out how. - Cute. Okay. (sighs) (gentle music) - [Jackie] Harry? You asleep? - I am. - [Jackie] How are you feeling? - How's everybody out there holding up? - (sighs) I'm really worried about Kirk. He, uh, he's plugged into those machines. They're only machines. - Did you ever know him to be any different? - No, I guess not. - [Harry] You're worried about the kids? (gentle music) - Harry, I never wanted it to be this way between us. When I met you, you were so big and funny looking and so good. And I loved you very much. - [Harry] I can change, honey. (sighs) - I can change, honey? What, Harry? Brands? (alarm blaring) - [Kirk] Some kind of scaling ladder, I think. - How many people? - [Kirk] I can't know that. - Let's go, Kirk. We'll bring our weapons. - Warning shots. We don't know who it is. - We can guess. Jackie, I want you at the front door, Lois at the back. If you don't get three flashes like this, shoot, and not just to warn, Lois, because it won't be us. All right? Let's go. (suspenseful music) (owl hooting) - [Kirk] What is it? - Sh! Sounds like something about 50 yards that way. (owl hooting) (suspenseful music) - I think I see it. - Shh, listen. Over there. (gun firing) Damn. You hit something. Let him lay, if he can get back, it'll be a lesson to the others. - Lee, I hit somebody, I'm gonna check. - It's too dangerous, head back. - Lee, I hit someone. - [Lee] Come on. (somber music) - [Kirk] Lee, it wasn't my fault. (gun firing) They're shooting back. (crickets chirping) - [Lee] He thought it was gonna be a picnic. Shit. He was with me. He bought the mines, he designed the system. (Marianne screams) - [Jackie] Jesus. - [Lois] Susie. Lee, get your bag. Lee, get your bag. - I can't. - What? You can't what? - My skills for our people. - Oh. This woman is my friend. She's teaching our children how to ride. She's badly hurt. - We have been over this. We agreed that some hard decisions might have to be made. We agreed that a kind of triage might be necessary. We agreed to survive. There is just so much food, Lois, so much medicine, it is not for outsiders. - [Lois] You're crazy. - [Marianne] I didn't agree. - [Lee] You married me. - That's another issue. This woman's hurt. Give her my share of the medicine. - You may need it. - Lee, I may not want to survive. Give her my share of the medicine. - We can't. - We can. Marianne hasn't voted her share yet. - But we need a surgeon. - Hell with him. I was a nurse. I can take out a bullet. - Look, dammit, we agreed. No outsiders. What if our kids need medicine when they get here. I want to vote on this medicine question. We agreed to certain principles of conduct. - Principles? Don't doctors take an oath? - You don't understand, Lois. We can't save the whole world. - He's right. How many other Susies will show up. Think about it, Lois, Lee is right. - Honey? Can you make her move? - Yes. Get his bag. - I vote yes. I'll help. - Christ. - Get a blanket. - [Announcer] Without historical precedent. Even the Just War Doctrine by Thomas Aquinas could not have created the uproar for today's papal signal. With this message which virtually excommunicates any Catholic who takes part in this present conflict, the Pope has sent his 783 million followers on a moral collision course against the two largest governments in the world. It is a bold and desperate political maneuver on (indistinct). (announcer speaking in foreign language) - Things weren't supposed to be like this. Everything was supposed to work. - Honey, life works. We just can't always control it. (birds chirping) (gentle music) (engine puttering) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - Lois. You've been taking such good care of me. - I hope, we can make some sense of all this. (gentle music) I'm so sorry. We never knew. I thought, when I was young, our parents always had a year supply of food in the attic. Preserves, hummus, pickles in jars. Seemed so natural when Lee proposed it. Then, the guns, shelters. It just got out of hand. You never think to ask where it's going. - I know. It's so easy just to let it all pass by. Like when (indistinct), thousands of people that died. I don't feel anything. I'm numb. This is too big to handle. All those people, halfway around the world. (pensive music) But now, I sure as hell feel something for them. ♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪ ♪ Gently down the stream ♪ ♪ Roll your teacher overboard ♪ ♪ And listen to her scream ♪ (kids screaming) (gentle upbeat music) - Country cousin, this is city slicker. Country cousin this is city slicker. Anyone there? Daddy? - Turn off should be soon. Anything yet? - No, are we in range? - We should be. Maybe there's sun spots. - Trillions of brothers in the cosmos and I get Carl Sagan. (Eric laughs) (gentle upbeat music) - You and I need to talk. - In a minute, have some breakfast. - Now. - Wait a minute. - [Lois] What? - Be quiet. I hear something. - Let's go. (plane engine droning) (bright music) - [Lois] Flying too low? - [Lee] Those rednecks were here yesterday. Family owns the airfield. - Oh shit, the reservoir. (engine roaring) (bright music) ♪ Land of the free ♪ ♪ And the home of the brave ♪ - [Kimmy] Country cousin, this is city slicker. Anyone there? Where the heck are you? - [Reporter] Meanwhile, administration policies. Observers are unsure whether the action will have any practical political impact. There is a growing number of reports of acts of civil disobedience in West Germany, Italy and Spain. And indications of peace strikes in the United States and the Soviet. - Kirk, you were supposed to buy an analysis kit. - What's the point, Lee? We can't hide anymore. There's no place to run. - [Marianne] How much bottled water do we have? - We were counting on the reservoir. - [Marianne] How much? - About a weeks worth. - Hey. Look, it's the kids. (Lois screams) - I told you. I told you, Eric's a survivor. - [Kirk] Come on, honey. Hurry. Hurry up, get in. (gentle music) (engine roaring) (all cheering) (birds chirping) - That's about far enough. Don't be stupid, Doc. Partners got a gun on the kids. (suspenseful music) (birds chirping) You got one damn minute to see those kids are okay and then we're gonna talk eviction. - Dad. Am I glad to see you. - Daddy, how are you? - Eric, what happened? - Uh, we were, the water pump broke. - Eric was great, Dad. He got arrested, got a water pump, and he got past the high- - Kimberly, when I want to hear from you, I will address you. I want my son to tell me why he arrived here with these vermin in his van. - They had guns. - He didn't have any choice, Dad. - Eric. I want to hear from Eric. - [Eric] Dad, I did the best I could. (hand slapping) - Daddy. - A man. I thought I sent a man out with those kids. Somebody I could be proud of. What am I gonna tell him out there? That my son couldn't cut it? - Dad, I did- (hand slapping) (Eric sobbing) - Stop that damn crying. - Hey asshole, you're supposed to check on these kids, see if they're all right. We just got them calmed down. Listen, you've got a half hour from right now to pack up and get the hell out of here, or we're gonna start losing one of these kids every 20 minutes that we're kept waiting. (birds chirping) - Well, there's got to be a plan where we can both keep the kids and get back here and stay safe. - What plan? - I don't know. Lee will think of something. - [Marianne] We women quit doing our own thinking? - It's just two of them. We could rush the van. - How many kids do you want to lose, Lee? - There's got to be acceptable loss here. Suppose we lose one child. - Am I going crazy? This is insane. - Lee! Lee, it's your kids. - Every action requires risk. I spend day after day telling people about risk. Should I have this operation, doctor. What about the complications. Suppose he dies. You still don't understand survival, do you? The patients who live are the ones who want to live. They don't give a damn about the odds. They hang on, despite the odds. - Lee, you're talking about babies. You have no right to jeopardize their lives. - Look, Lois, you're a parent. You make decisions for your children like that all the time. What about Carl's operation? - Whose child is it acceptable to lose? Yours? Lois'? Mine? - Yours? - Mine. You don't just marry a man when they come with kids. - You're wasting time. - We need Harry in on this. - You're right, come on, let's get him. - I don't know, Lois. Asking me to inject a little sanity into this group, isn't that kind of like asking the Three Stooges to do your plumbing? - Harry, you're smarter than you look. - Compliments will get you everywhere. - Well I think the war just should never have existed because it's so horrible. (pensive music) - I don't want bombs to kill us. - You won't even feel it. - It won't happen, it can't. - Megan, are those guys going to kill us? - No. No way. You must be warm in that bag. - I'm okay. - Come on, get out of that bag, come over here with us. - No. I mean, I'm okay. - (laughs) He wet his pants. - [Peter] Harry! - [Kimmy] Come on stupid, nobody cares. - Come on. - I sure don't. (birds chirping) (quiet tense music) - I don't know what you're talking about, that's not gonna work. - Oh my god. The half hour is up. If we can't make a decision, let's at least get down there and we'll think of something on the way. - All right, now look. We're gonna take the high ground near the meadow gate where we won't be as vulnerable and we can still watch the van. - [Lee] Let's go. (gun firing) - You didn't have to do that. You nearly scared them half out their wits. - They're gonna be more than scared if their daddies don't get out here in the next 30 seconds. - Right, right on time. - [Virgil] What the hell are they up to? Son of a bitch. (gun firing) - What are we gonna do now? - Shut up and let me think. If they're shooting, I don't want to be sitting next to this tank of gas. Who knows how they shoot. - Well, they're, they're not gonna fire at their own kids. - I wouldn't put it past that Doc. We'll be a lot safer over there. Then we can cover this van and still be far enough away from it. - [Ernie] Good thinking. - We'll grab the girl for cover. (Megan screaming) - All right, your little bastards, stay here. We've got you covered. If you try to get out, we're gonna shoot the gas tank. And, uh, you know what happens then. - [Carl] No. - [Kimmy] That was a rhetorical question, Carl. - [Ernie] Watch. (glass crashing) (gun firing) (steam hissing) So stay put. Except you. - [Kimmy] They've got Megan! (gun firing) - I don't know, Virgil, I'm losing a lot of blood. - It's your own God damn fault. - Serves you right, you know. - Shut up, you little brat. - [Virgil] It's nothing but a little cut. - (groans) I just, I just wish we were, I just wish we were out of here. - Not until we got what we came here for. - Ah, whatever that was. - [Joe] This is Joe Stevenson in New York. An immediate cease fire was declared moments ago in a joint announcement released by the White House and the Kremlin. Both nations have agreed to continue around the clock negotiations to further deescalate the world wide crisis. I repeat, the White House and the Kremlin have announced an immediate cease fire. It is believed- - Thank God. - [Joe] That a world wide outpouring of peace demonstrations- - I've got to tell them. - [Joe] Riots and mass desertions- - They'll stop. For the kids, they'll stop. - [Joe] From combatant forces leaders from both the United States and the Soviet Union. - It's over. - [Lois] Stop, Harry, watch out. - It's over! - Wait, what is he saying? - Harry, stop! - Stop. - It's over. - What are they up to now? - Stop! It's over. - Stop Harry. - [Megan] Daddy. (gun firing) - Harry! - Oh God. - You shot him, you shot him. - [Jackie] Will he live? - [Lee] If I can get the bullet out. - It's over. It said on the radio. The war is over. - Fine, Harry, it will be all right. - Of course it's a trick. The Russians know English, they're broadcasting in English. - No, no, I heard. - All right. - It's propaganda, Harry. Just waiting for us to lower on guard on everything we've got here and then wham. - But maybe? - No, no, no maybes. No maybes. (guns firing) (women gasping) - We can't just sit here. - What are we gonna do without guns? (gun firing) - None of you understand. Goddamn suburban panty waists! Jackie knows them. I can teach Jackie. We've got food. We'll live. Drop that, Kirk. - I was planning to. It's over, Lee. It makes no sense. - Makes no sense. That's what they taught you in the Coast Guard, Coast Guard, eh? God damn big hero. Understands war. - You're right. I understand war, and I know when they're over. This one's over. It was over for us before it began. - [Lee] God damn traitor. There will be no cowards in my army. (gun firing) (blow thudding) (ominous music) - No, wait. Stay back. - [Megan] Daddy, daddy.
