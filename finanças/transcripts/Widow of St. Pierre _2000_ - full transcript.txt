The Widow of Saint-Pierre. That year, Newfoundland saw the thickest fog in 10 years. For three months, one could not see beyond the tip of their boat. Ships bells did not prevent schooners from getting lost, leaving the fate of its fishermen to God, or the devil. Get to work, Goddamn it! Back to your quarters! Which boat do you work for? "Go?lette Fernande." We got lost four days ago. I am Louis Ollivier, he's Neel Auguste. Come aboard. The account of this true story can be found at the city hall of Saint-Pierre. Second French Republic. Hop! Hop! Hop! I said, "fat." Old Coupard is fat. I say, "big." We shall see. I said fat. He is fat. He's not skinny, but he's not fat, either. He's fat! Shhh! You see, he's big. No, he's fat. Who's there? Who's there? Fat. Big. - Fat. - Big. - Fat. - Big. - Fat. - Big. Get ready! Hoist it! - Be careful! - Bring it down! At last he is here. He's really beautiful. Of course he is. He likes your hands. That means less of them for me. Are you jealous? Of course, I am jealous. Well, that's good. Jealousy suits you well. Captain! We caught L'Ileaux Chiens' murderers, those who killed Coupard. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello. Where are they? On the dock, over there. How could they do such a thing? You'll put them in the courtyard cells? Yes. Why did they do it? Neel Auguste, do you hear me? Yes, I do. Call me President, and stand up when you address me. President. Was it your idea to go to Ileaux Chiens? Maybe. No, it was my idea. I live there. Stand up, Louis Ollivier, and speak louder. You were last seen at the Caf? Du Nord at...? So what time was it? "Around 10:00 precisely," President. Neel Auguste, did you open Coupard's door? No, President, we did not. He came outside. He had to be scared. He was carrying a knife. Was he holding it? Remain standing. Was he holding it? Who is supposed to answer? You answer. Was Coupard holding his knife? - Yes, he was. - What did you do, then? - I went behind him. - What for? Why did you go behind him? To restrain him, President. So, Louis Ollivier restrained Coupard. And Neel, were you facing him? Did you feel threatened by the knife? No. I hit his arm. Can you show us how? Like that. I assume he dropped the knife? Did you pick it up? - Of course. - What for? I did not want to leave it there. How about you, Ollivier? Did you let go of him, once he dropped the knife? He let him go afterwards. After what? After the... stabbing. Finally. What stabbing? You know, sir. When I... stabbed Coupard. - Did you stab him once? - I don't know. I don't know. I don't know anymore. Stand up, Neel Auguste. Remain standing! What's his name? I don't know. He won't answer to anything. You have to name him. Why don't you pick a name? "Pickled Herring." Are you serious? Of course I am. You don't like it? Yes, I do. "Pickled Herring" is great! You don't like the horse. That's not true. If you like him, I like him, too. I like whatever you like. It's just the way it is. You can't stop it. What are those murderers facing? The worst thing. - The guillotine? - Probably. Neel Auguste and Louis Ollivier, if you want to get this over with, tell us why you tried to cut him up. Why did you want to cut him up? To see if he was fat. Just to see if he was fat. We wanted to see if he was big or fat. Big or fat! Deliberation! They made the decision! Neel Auguste will be guillotined, and Louis Ollivier will go to jail. They made the decision! Neel Auguste will be guillotined... They decided! Neel will get his head chopped off. And Louis Ollivier will go to jail. This is a Republic. The republic kills the killers. That's how it goes. Will you be the executioner, officer? Certainly not. Not me. Here we go. Open the door. Make way. Please make way. Make way. Louis! Louis! Too bad it's not me. Did you see? What? He can't even look through the window. He's better off in the dark. I wouldn't mind chopping that head off. But how? We have no guillotine, and no executioner. If we can't guillotine that beast, I'll look like a fool. Excuse me, Governor, Couldn't we have a guillotine and an executioner sent in from Paris? In Martinique... They don't care about the islands. If justice is important for the territories, Paris should send us what we need. Dr. Guillotin fucked us over with his "widow." Before him, they executed by hanging, shooting... now we need a guillotine, an executioner, the whole thing. - Let us ask Paris. - It will take forever. Writing back and forth, it will take months. At that speed, that beast will keep his head forever. Don't interrupt my meeting. We're bringing in some lamps, Papa. That's right. It was getting dark. Papa, can we go see that French boat? Sure. But tell the sergeant to use the covered coach. - It's going to rain. - Thanks, Papa, we'll tell him. - Good night, gentlemen. - Good night. So...? No petition for pardon? So be it. But he'll have to be guillotined, one way or another. I don't want my people to laugh at me. Port, anyone? He's looking at my plants. How long will he be waiting to be killed? I don't know. As long as it takes to get a guillotine. - Do you like my new perfume? - Yes. So he might wait for months, years...? Centuries. If they have no guillotine, why not let him go? You are right. Tomorrow I'll open his cell and let him out. I'm not kidding, Jean. I'm not either. Do I look like I'm kidding? She wants to talk to you. My wife wants to talk to you. But you don't have to. You don't. Go upstairs. She's waiting for you. Hello, sir. Come in. Take a seat. Come on. Take a seat. Start chatting. I'll fix some tea. She wants you to take care of the garden. You can help her with the flowers. You don't have to accept, but if you do, you'll have to work, okay? Do you know anything about flowers? No. Nothing. Forget it, you don't have to do it. We won't have tea. I... broke the pot. You know plants don't grow well around here. Only boats grow around here. The climate isn't... Well... will you help me grow a garden in the back yard? A greenhouse. A small greenhouse. You... know what it is? No. But it's okay. I will show you. I do not know what you have decided to do. Yes. You will? Well...? Yes, I will. Thank you! Thank you so much! And thanks to you, too! Would you like something to eat? No. You can go, then. Now you'll have better meals... as compensation for your work. I don't want to take advantage of you. She does not either. And if things work out with the flowers, the greenhouse, you'll get a lamp, and you'll get your belongings. We'll see. Go now. You're it! Look at that! How wonderful! Bravo! A real fire! With logs coming from France! It's nothing, but it's so nice. Long live the Governor! Madame Venot... Excuse me, kids. Will the captain ever do us the honor on joining us on Sundays, Governor? Isn't it Madame La Capitaine you are longing for, officer? Unfortunately, you won't be beheaded. And "Madame La" only deals with extreme cases. Her husband first, then Neel Auguste, the murderer. Or the other way around! You know she likes to help others, and for free. Thank God! He's already getting room and board. Should your murderer be paid for his release? Because that's what it is! What do you mean, "my" murderer? Sit down, Papa. You know the governor talks before he thinks. He is "our" murderer, unfortunately. - Excuse me... - I've said this before, he'll keep his head as long as we don't have a guillotine. I sent my request for a "widow" three months ago. It's already winter. Cut his head off if you'd like! Why is she called "Madame La"? So as to not call her Madame la Capitaine. We can't call her that in a country of fishermen. "Madame La" is a nice name. It's very smart. - Madame La. - Madame La. Why did Madame La abandon an important family for a mere soldier? What do you think? Maybe because she's in love. Her heart is driven by her passions. Let us hope her passions won't drive her too far. I know you were completely drunk the night you... So now, you're going to show them how you really are, now that you don't drink anymore. But you'll have to be patient until they understand. That's right. It's not a small thing to have killed a man, and to have killed him that way. Hop on, I'll pull you. - No, thanks. - Please. You are not my servant, Neel. I really appreciate your trust. Why do you do that? Excuse me? Madame La, why do you do that? Because... people always change, no matter what. People can be evil one day, and good another. They change. And I am sure of that. Yes, I am. Hello! Hello! He's come to take care of La Malvilain's roof. It surely needs repair. And so does she! In the mean time, he can pull my sleigh. You remember where my house is? If you like widows, this is the place. There's plenty of them! Why do they call it "L'Ileaux Chiens"? Because of the walrus, the "sea dogs." - That's right. - But they have disappeared. Are there many widows around here? Are there...? Neel, what are you doing? La Malvilain lives over there. We'd have to walk by Coupard's. Let's go this way. Open the door! Make way! Keep him warm. I've spared you the protocol. This is the warmest room, enjoy it. - Make yourself comfortable. - I am comfortable, thanks. Would you like some port? It's a delicious Portuguese wine. It keeps you warm. How is your beautiful wife? She is not too bored in Saint-Pierre? So... how is Madame La? Have a taste. Tell me what you think. - You can tell me frankly. - It's an acquired taste. Evidently. People are not curious anymore. Getting back to your wife, you know, right? Of course. And... do you think it's appropriate? What? Do you think it's appropriate for her to walk around with a murderer? As far as I'm concerned, he can just run away. But what if we receive "The Widow" and the executioner, and there's nobody to execute? Imagine that? So, please, for once... don't be so nice to your wife, and lock up the murderer. Let's leave my wife alone. You are captain, but also head of the penitentiary. That is right. I will thus take the condemned to "The Widow" in due time. Until then, he is my responsibility. While we're waiting for that god damn "widow"... My duty is to keep the prisoners available and in good health, and that's what I am doing. Does his health depend on him being stuck to Madame La? Madame La is my business, so mind your own. Mind your own business. Captain, your disrespect is pissing me off, and that's not new. They had warned me. They had warned you about what? You know very well. Forget it. I just wanted to warn you about rumors. A murderer is still a man, some say. And your wife is so... modern. My wife knows what she's doing. Anyone who disrespects her will have to kill me before I kill them. In that case... in that case, of course... that reassures me. Let's talk about why you asked me here. Well... that was it. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello, Madame La. He's the condemned. He came to fix your roof. Thanks for taking care of us. Get inside, it's so cold. Come in, Neel. No, thanks. They're for you, and for Emilie. Do you want a cookie, Emilie? You are so lucky to have a daughter like her. You don't have any children? Ever since he quit drinking, that man has been wonderful. I know. He's not a bad person. You know him pretty well. - Are you done? - Yes. Have you lost your appetite? Are you worried about something? I'm not hungry, that's all. But with that cold... Fucking winter! If you don't like winter, Captain, you shouldn't have come here. I didn't have a choice. And your wife... she deals with the cold better than you do. Eat your soup, okay? Gentlemen. That guy is bizarre. He's not a guy. He's a captain. And he's always been bizarre. Even back in Paris. You see? No more hammering. No more hammering! No more hammering! No more hammering! That's right, no more hammering. No more noise. No more hammering, no more Neel, and no more Mama. Wait. Stop. Say goodbye, I'll wait outside. Neel? If you... If... Running away would be terrible. My husband would be executed instead of you. It won't happen. Neel? Why do you do everything I say? - Hello, Neel. - Hello. Hey, convict! Why aren't you locked up? What are you doing outside alone? - I'm clearing up the way. - I'll clear you up for you! Drop the shovel! Drop it, Goddamn it! Hand me your saber. Drop it now! Piss off! Piss off! Get back to work, Neel. Who mandated this? Tell them that next time, there could be an accident of my "involuntary" doing. La Capitaine is waiting for you at the plant shop. Down the road. She's treating you to lunch. I'll go when I'm done. Do you really think they'll grow here? Yes. I don't think I ever could. "The top of the trees." - "The tip..." - "Top." "Top... of the Ir... the trees." - "The sound..." - "The sound... of night... in gales." "The pretty... meadows." "The... pretty... meadows." Now read this to yourself, silently. No, with your eyes only. "The ..." Don't say it. Read it to yourself. "The roofs..." No, read it to yourself. - "of winter..." - "...winter..." "that..." - "...shines." - "...shine." Jean... Jean. Don't take any risks for me. Whom else should I take them for? I don't want you to. I don't want you to. They can't do anything against me. They don't have my strength. What strength? What strength? This... and this... and this. May 2nd, 1850 Fort-de-France, Martinique. See how he's staring at her. They probably don't spend their nights sleeping. I would wager my husband. We're not all lucky enough to have a condemned we can use as a rival, to invigorate our dear husbands. You don't have a condemned, but you can try the captain, dear. No, thank you. He might spoil my spring time by being dedicated to his wife. Sirs, the first boat of the season is bringing some news. We'll be receiving a "widow" very soon. There public never disappoints anyone. How about the executioner? Well... I have not heard of that. They never mentioned the executioner. The "Marie-Galante" will bring in the tools for the execution, but that's all. Nobody to cut the head off. Where is that "widow" coming from? From Martinique. They just got a new one, so they're sending in their old one. And no executioner? They have one on Martinique. You can't borrow an executioner, and no captain would have one on their boat. So we'll have to find one here. If there's a potential executioner here, find him. I'm afraid we won't find anyone. You are right. We won't find anyone, which is good. The people of Saint-Pierre are no executioners. Madame, don't expose your business to all. You're already associating with a soon to be executed... Please be more specific. I'm afraid we did not get that. That's right. I did not get it either. Is this smoking room not a refuge away from the ladies, even our wives? I'm quoting you here. Don't provoke the captain and then blame me for it. You were talking business, is that right? Not at all. I was surprised to see her around the smoking room. That's it. Nothing else. "Nothing else..." Since there's a doubt, I demand an apology right now. Loud and clear, so every one can hear. With pleasure. I sincerely apologize, Madame, for what you think I said, but that I did not mean. Come on, Jean. You just ridiculed yourself, sir. With one word it could go further. Please, Jean. I would love for you to dare. No? Too bad. Maybe some other time. Gentlemen, if I may say so. He does not even have to fuck us to make cuckolds of our husbands. Here it is! Neel Auguste, you are now an honorary member of the Caf? Du Nord, a life time member! And you'll have a long life. Captain? President Venot is here. He wants to talk to you. Captain? I heard you. Our condemned has once again done the impossible. He saved the Caf? Du Nord from sinking. And what would Saint-Pierre be without it? Well... let's take a walk, please. Neel Auguste's popularity is becoming alarming. Please, let's talk about it. I understand your position, you know. You are in charge of the execution of the condemned, so... Between you and me, I'd also prefer the execution to not take place. Neel Auguste has gotten too popular. We condemned a criminal, and we'll execute a good person. Everyone here would like to have him for lunch on Sundays. We'll have to execute him. Paris demands it. Your wife is too compassionate. Seriously, what will people think when the day comes? What will you do with the condemned when "The Widow" gets here? So, Captain? The condemned will be here. Once you have the machine and the executioner, I'll do my job. And in the meantime? Beware. Our Republic is touchy. Thank you. Thanks for warning me. Here. A gift from the soon to be executed. Sir. The Council should take care of these roads, don't you think? Emilie, you can eat on your own. No... I like it. Your meal will be cold. Are you not surprised I asked you to cut the flowers? Yes, but... But what? I suspected they were for Jeanne-Marie. "Jeanne-Marie"? Jeanne-Marie, that says it all. Are you blushing? If it is possible, Neel and I may get married. We need to do it before I start to show. I'm sorry. There's no need to apologize. Oyez! Oyez! "The Governor's Council asks," in accordance with the laws of our Republic's justice system, that every adult male with no criminal record, and who would like to act as public executioner and take advantage of the benefits of the position, "present themselves at the Government's Palace." Tell us... what is a public executioner? Why don't you ask the Government? Is it to cut off Neel's head? Possibly... but I'm not supposed to know. Does anyone need a ride to Saint-Pierre? They won't find anyone to cut your head off. Nobody could do that. It is not hard to kill a man. You know? I know. Did you know? The announcer says they want to hire an executioner here. They want to pay someone from here to kill him. The pricks want to gain Paris' respect. Don't worry, Neel. There are no executioners here. There are a few lost souls, but no executioners. - I'm not so sure. - How much to cut his head off, when he's tied down in front of everyone? Goddamn it! I would never do that! Don't feel superior. There is nobody here for that job. That's right. Nobody wants dirty money. He could not go back to France. He would not be welcome on a boat. They put up fliers everywhere. And so what? We can take them down. Let's go! "The Governor's Council..." In the presence of God, the origin of your love, and Who will always be with you, we will proceed. Ariel Neel Auguste, do you take L?ontine Jeanne-Marie Malvilain as your wife? I do. L?ontine Jeanne-Marie Malvilain... It's okay, I am here. Do you take Ariel Neel Auguste as your husband? I do, Father. You are now joined in marriage, until death do you part. Why endorse such a masquerade in the name of the Church? Don't talk about sacraments in such a way. La Malvilain was living in sin. It's ridiculous! Why not let him have his own business, working for the Navy? Captain, did you have the right... did you have the right to allow that wedding? Yes, I did. Do you have any doubts about it? What rights are you talking about? We are not in Paris. Technically, Neel is under my command. Jeanne-Marie Malvilain is French, she wanted paternity to be established, and Neel Auguste said he was the father. I made the marriage official in the context of our military system, however ironic that may sound. There you go! My council wouldn't take my advice, and refused to pardon Neel Auguste. We'll have one more widow and one more orphan. Gentlemen, the Captain does all he can to piss us off! What's wrong, Louis? I just wanted to tell you... a ship is arriving. It's the "Marie-Galante." It's coming from Martinique, with "The Widow." The ship's having problems. The helm's broken. - Where's the captain? - At the harbor. I'll be back. What are you doing? The captain said he did not want him to be out today. Did he say to lock him up? No. What did he say exactly? He said he did not want Neel outside. Was that a specific order? No, not really... specific. So open the door. He said he wanted... What my husband wants is up to me. Open that door! And leave us alone! Captain, the commander requested our help to bring his ship to shore. I thought we could use your military boats. No. Are you declining to help us with your resources, knowing that ship is bringing in "The Widow"? That's right. Why don't you go tell your superiors? How about helping the sailors? They can't wait to reach the shore. If they can't wait, why don't they swim to the shore? Throw "The Widow" to the sea, and we'll take care of the sailors. Yes, throw it to the sea! Come over here, please. The mother was still pregnant when they left France. They did not like Martinique, so here they are. We had not had any immigrants for a while. Welcome to Saint-Pierre! There you go! The Council is expecting you. Come over here. Take a seat. Mr. Chevassus, welcome! Have you ever been convicted of any crime? I don't think so. Well, have you ever been to jail, in France or in Martinique? Your word will be enough. No. You have my word. Good. You need a good job, Mr. Chevassus. Yes... An easy job that pays well, but that requires dignity and discretion. A job that will serve the republic. Do you want to be an executioner? The Governor has little time. I advice you to think about it well. This is a once in a lifetime offer. We'll base our decision on your answer. Either you can become an honorable citizen here, and that is what we are offering you, or you are only requesting asylum. And unless you have substantial savings... Do you have any? Well, too bad for you. The customs officer may consider your case. Without any savings, there is no way. Do you know much about wood? - A little. - That is good. Gentlemen, let us explain to Mr. Chevassus the many material advantages he'll receive as an executioner, as a public executioner, so he can make an informed decision. So... free housing, here in town, and 2,000 francs. Here's the detail. 500 to repair and put the guillotine together, 1000 for the execution, and 500 to tidy up, which adds up to 2,000 francs, right? That's what it says here on the paper. You can ask for an advance, which will be granted when you sign your contract, right now. So you want it or not? Tell me before I leave. You cannot hesitate. Being an executioner is a vocation. Do you want to chop heads off or not? Yes. Good! And don't even think of changing your mind. From now on, you're an executioner or a victim, make your choice. Good day, gentlemen. Congratulations, Mr. Chevassus. You should be happy, your husband has found a job. You are lucky, your troubles are over. We are hiring sailors! We are hiring sailors, to bring the Marie-Galante to shore. The superintendent will pay you four francs per trip from 4:00 a.m. to afternoon, and six francs from 4:00 a.m. to dusk. That's not well paid. Go get "The Widow" yourself! The announcer and the officers can already fill up a boat. The superintendent will increase the wage for both ways. You'll get six francs during the day, and nine francs after dusk. What are you doing? Are you crazy? It's for Jeanne-Marie and the baby. Neel! Neel Auguste, how many trips? All of them! Pauline, leave him alone now. Can you go with no sleep? Put his name down. Let's go home. There's nothing else you can do. Come on, let's go! - Let's go! - No! God might not want us to get "The Widow." God isn't the only arbiter. Excuse me. Thank you. "The Widow" is being brought in, we have an executioner. That poor man is finally going to get executed. I think we'll all miss him. My husband wanted to pardon him, did you not? - Not at all. - That's what you kept saying. I did not want to make promises we could not keep. There's a difference. I agree with you, we'll miss him. Our lives will go back to the same routine. Life here is going to be such a bore. Eug?nie, please... if you're bored, find an intelligent occupation. - Pick up crocheting. - Crocheting? You obviously don't know a thing about it! I am afraid our wives' opinion reflects that of the general population. Executioner, go to work! Executioner, go to work! Children, never cut off an adult! See, you agree with us. Pardon me. Are you mad at me? Yes. No. What's going to happen? I don't know. - Can you see him? - No. Why is he doing that? It's a shortcut to hell. He's been rowing for so long, with nothing to eat or drink. He's strong enough to row to Newfoundland. He could go so far... so far we'd never find him again. 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39... The ship brought in some newspapers from Paris. 42, 43, 44. You see what kind of man he's become? One man gets accused, another gets punished. I know. It's always the case. Things are not going well in Paris. People are rioting... and being repressed... executed even. How awful. My command has completely changed. They are waiting for you at the harbor. It's urgent. I'll be right there. Make way! Go away! Go home! Don't provoke them. Don't move! You idiot! Whatever happens, don't move! Go home! Move away! A "widow" with no executioner is just a pile of wood. Don't fight for a pile of wood! Come on! Go home! Go! You were quite hungry. Tomorrow we'll bring your 44 francs to your wife. You'd be strong enough to row to Newfoundland. That awful ship does not need towing today. - No. - The hell with it! We're going to L'Ileaux Chiens to give Jeanne-Marie the money, and a few other things. That's good. What does that look mean? It's the look of a man who loves his wife, and who can read her eyes. What can you read? Be cautious, Pauline. Thank you, Jean. I hope a storm wrecks the ship. You can't wish that on the sailors. Quit annoying me with your good heart! Gentlemen, we have to reconsider Neel Auguste's case. His execution could lead to riots. What do you mean, "We have to"? Who gives you the authority to come here and threaten us? Did you get the authority from headquarters? No. Mr. Hugo, whose opinion you probably respect, once said that a riot strengthens the systems it does not overthrow. If one were to arise, your men would contain it, would they not, Captain? No. I refuse to use force against the population or to even threaten it. At last, here we are. Captain, don't you think more sentimental motives led you and your wife to take that execution a little too personally? Does my wife bother you? Keep those remarks to yourself. I came to tell you that I refuse to allow my detachment to oversee Neel Auguste's execution. That's how it will be. There is no room for negotiation. Come on... No. Captain, the fact that the condemned was assigned voluntary public work kept him available to the justice system. That's all very well. But only the law dictates what is legal and what is not. And you've just stepped out of the justice system. Seriously so. And your humanism will be severely looked down upon, especially in Paris. You'll be seen as a rebel, and even worse. I don't expect the Council to feel sorry for me and my future, and I even allow you to rejoice and congratulate each other. Gentlemen. Captain, you know what is going on in Paris these days. - I know that. - You can change your mind. Please. You're losing yourself. Thank you, gentlemen, from the bottom of my heart. He's done with. Do you trust me, Neel? Yes, I do. Do you love me enough to obey me, no matter what? Yes. Flee to New Newfoundland. I will make sure your wife meets you there. You are strong enough to row there. You have enough to eat for more than two weeks. Run! Save your life! I can't do that. No. "Thank you, Madame La, you're so nice." I've had enough of being nice! Run away! Were you looking for me? No. Madame La didn't tell you anything? No. I had escaped. So why did you come back? I did not want to create problems. Too bad. Captain. Madame La came home alone. And...? - The condemned was not there. - He's coming. Forgive me. Forgive me, Jean. Neel did what I said. He ran away. Forgive me. Do you understand? Do you understand? All he did was obey you. Yes. Come over here. Why? I won't take him to the guillotine. So it's true? You accepted? - I cannot talk about it. - Of course, an executioner does not talk. And nobody wants to talk to an executioner. People won't even take his money. What will you do when the locals know who you are? Everything's working well. Everything comes to us. No need to go out. Plus, I'll never make as much money. Come with me. I have to show you something. Sir, here's the head you're going to chop off. Can you hear me? You're going to cut this neck, those veins, this throat. Don't worry, Madame La. It's not done yet. You're just like my husband. You're so fatalistic. Please... Papa, the captain's here. Quiet. Don't look at him. Let's act natural and go on with our picnic. Forget that man. Papa, eat! Don't look at him. That captain's got stature. He's a good rider, too. Papa... I've asked for his repatriation for serious political reasons. Political?! That's enough, Papa! The rebel is bad-mouthing me all the way to Paris. Exactly. Nonsense. Nonsense? That Madame La and her husband are fucking around... Charles-Paul! Piss off, Madame! Piss off! Yes, they are fucking around with that Neel Auguste, and I don't even dare go out anymore, afraid that I might run into the m. Do you know of what I accused him in my letter? Of mutiny. My God, you want him executed? Is that it? It's a good spot for them. You're here. We're getting ready for winter. A military ship is arriving. Was that expected? I'm going to get ready. Present... arms! Captain, your headquarters demand your return. Here is Captain Numontier, who will be replacing you. Here are the orders. I can inform you that we'll take the trip together. - When will that be? - Tomorrow or the following day. Your wife can join us or travel at a later date. What would you prefer? She usually makes her own decisions. Come with me. Captain, I want to talk with you, man to man. We'll meet up with the fleet, and we'll sail the Caribbean for a few weeks. Don't expect to be in France before several months. In the meantime, your wife and you yourself will be free to move about at will... as my personal guests, let's say. What do you mean, "We'll be free"? Give me your word that you'll make yourself available until I hand you over to the disciplinary commission in Saint-Malo. The court-martial will be expecting you. The cowards of Saint-Pierre want your ass, and there public likes to set precedents. In France, two officers are awaiting execution. When leaders feel threatened, they become ferocious. The governor and the superintendent asked me to send a new report. I just read it. It's overwhelming. Thank you for trusting me, Commandant. I am truly sorry, Captain. Who the hell is that Neel Auguste? My wife's prot?g?. I'd like for him to not hear a word of this until we are in France. It's important to me. You can count on me. Your word will be enough. You have it, Commandant. I've been dismissed. They expect me in Paris. But what...? How about Neel? We'll be leaving in two days. Did you suffer serious disciplinary sanctions? Well, I did not get promoted... Tell me, Jean. Tell me. We shall see. It's my... - It's my fault. - No. It's not your fault if I love you. I love you because of who you are. I wouldn't have wanted you to act otherwise. Everything's okay. I'm scared... I'm scared. I'm scared. My love. Show me your face. Observe your father and learn much. Go! He'll be yours by tonight or tomorrow. As soon as he comes back. Present... arms! I forgot to tell you. His name is "Pickled Herring." At last we'll have our honeymoon. "The two boats." The seashore. The sound of nightingales. "The pretty meadows." Neel Auguste did not have the time to learn how to read with ease. Proceed. He never showed any sign of rebellion. He probably thought his crime was unforgivable and his punishment justified. "The Widow" did not work, and Neel Auguste had to be killed with an axe. On my command... eyes front! Present... arms! Load your guns! Ready! They can't touch us. I love you. Fire! My husband was accused of mutiny, and executed. I'll remain Madame La, his widow, his wife, until my last breath. The public executioner mysteriously disappeared not long after those events.
