Cat got your tongue? - Victoria. - Victoria? You must have another. Another? The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have three different names. First of all, there's the name that the family use daily, such as... - Peter. - Augustus. - Alonzo. - Or James. But I tell you a cat needs a name that's particular. A name that's peculiar and more dignified. Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular? Or spread out his whiskers? Or cherish his pride? But above and beyond, there's still one name left over. And that is the name that you never will guess. The name that no human research can discover, but the cat herself knows and will never confess. When you notice a cat in profound meditation, the reason, I tell you, is always the same. Her mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of her name. Her ineffable, effable, effanineffable, deep and inscrutable, singular name, name, name, name, name, name, name, name, name, name, name, name, name, name.

I demand that you grant me another life. You will never go to the Heaviside Layer. Oh? We'll see about that. Growltiger, make her walk the plank. Say it's me... ...or you'll drown in that river. You'll never be my Jellicle choice. This is your last chance. Never! Where is Old Deuteronomy? Where is she? We don't know. Where is she? Look, it was only a bit of fun. We didn't know he was gonna take Old Deut. There must be something we can do. We can't just magic her back. Yes, we can. Yes, we can. You're a magician. What? It's not a bad idea.
