Oh oh. Yeah, yeah heart attack, heart attack. Can't keep up. How you doin' Nicky? All right all right all right all right. Listen up. We got this big city wide tournament comin' up and first prize is $3000. You know what that means? It means you win and you buy yourself one of "em funky fresh white Mercedes with tinted windows and an AMG kit. And with the spare money, we'll scare the shit outta some white folks by teaching their kids the dance. Nobody's listenin'. Well I got some business to get to. Please inform Johnny Law that I waited as long as I could. Why don't you tell him yourself. Soldier. Hey word on the street is you got your badge takin' away. Is that true? Well yeah it's true Speedboat. Very true. So now you not Johnny Law anymore you're just Johnny. Speedboat you're a pretty perceptive guy but there's more to the story. Like what? Like I'm only under suspension. Next week I get my old job back and I become Johnny Law once again. I knew that, I knew that man. I knew that but you didn't let me finish my story. 'Cause I'm sayin' this guy walks up to me and says "Hey you know that cop Soldier? "He's a pig.” I said "Nobody says that, man." I said "You keep talkin' I'ma kick you where the good Lord split ya and I was gon' kick his ass for you man. For me? For you. "Cause you're a very, very dear friend of mine. Ladies and gentlemen, let's give this man a round of applause. Isn't he great? I appreciate the kind words Speedboat. Now remember, I'm still in charge of your community service program. According to my calculations, you still owe us another 11 days to get this event completed. So, unless you wanna spend the rest of the time in jail where you belong. I suggest you get on it. I tell everybody. Just doin' my job. Oh Soldier, I love it when you talk. - C'mon clear out, clear out. - Hey move back you guys. Move back. This guy's pulse is very weak, somebody call an ambulance. Nicky, what is it baby? We didn't mean nothin' by it. We just wanted a little boost. A boost? Soldier. It's all right, it's all right. Can you clear out give us some room? How they doin'? Vince is not gonna make it. And the other kids on it's way out too, man. They were doin' coke? Yeah. Supplier runs out of lactose so what does he do? He cuts the stuff with rat poison man. My sister Nicky is in a coma. Well what are you gonna do about it? You know who's pushin' the shit why don't you nail the fuckers? Or you gettin' paid too? Listen up Speedboat, I can nail the guy on the street, that's not the problem. I need him to lead me to the main suppliers, you got that? Yeah, yeah so you're tellin' me there's nothing you can do? I'm tellin' ya I'm workin' on it. I got an idea. Why don't you have all your friends stop doin® the shit like it's popcorn. - What? - Yeah. The whole problem will clear up over night. - Man asshole- - He's right. No buyers, no pushers. Simple economics. Well let me tell you somethin' about economics, all right? You know who's doin' it but you won't nail him because you gettin' paid by the man. That's economics. No Speedboat, that's a lot of shit and you know it. Soldier, I know that look. Don't do anything stupid. Remember you're under suspension. Sweet, sweet sugar. Lay off man. Hey I see you're only young. Gimme some baby. Ah so you still keeping company then? What's it to you? Girl you know I aint got time to make a show. Well I'll tell you what, get yourself some first class transportation and then maybe I'll give it a thought. You cold baby, cold. So tell me, what you hear about these kids dyin' from bad drugs? You're kidding me, yeah? No. I mean you believe those kids, they do that shit we sell? Kids is damn fools baby. Fools deserve to die. You deserve to die. Walk away mama, I'm gon' catch you one day. Chill. Hey I just came in here to do the same thing you did. But looks like you don't need much help. Hey I'd love to stay and help you clean up but I wouldn't want to take the credit away from you on this one bro. See ya. Okay, we got many presidents to consider. There's Hamish, there's Burman, there's Cinella, Ventura, Bosworth, Debay, the books full of 'em. Like this baby. This baby says it all. "The people versus Crants” It's the same mandamus. Or just about. That's about it for habeas corpus. Now, getting into a legal search and seizure- - I always figured one day Soldier would lose it. I mean you might nod your head every once in a while for Christ's sake just to let me know you're alive. How 'bout it pal? Give me a hand here. I've got news for you Shapiro, I'm guilty. So what? Isn't that Shapiro? It's court appointed. Soldier refused to go with council. Six years on course and all that heroic marine bullshit. Slide right over that suspension thing. Hey every now and then, roll your shoulder. Give us some pain. Believe me it'll be a cinch. Your honor, if it pleases the court, I move at this time for a motion on mistrial. We're current preparing a written mandamus Which will- - Excuse me Mr Shapiro, but it's customary to wait until the trial begins before declaring a mistrial. Now sit down. I want to warn you Mr Shapiro. I will not put up with your foolishness in my court. Now I consider this case of precedence setting importance. That's why I'm holding it in camera. Do I make myself perfectly clear, Mr Shapiro? Mr Kelly, you've been charged with four counts of murder in the second degree. How do you plead? We plead not guilty by reason of insanity. Your honor, my client is not fit to stand trial. He refuses to take part in his own defense. He's not cognizant of the surroundings or aware of the seriousness of the charges leveled against him. And |I insist, no I demand your honor. That he receives proper psychiatric evaluation in accordance with article seven 30 section 10 of the legal definition of fitness to proceed. Very well Mr Shapiro. In accordance with article seven 30 I have no choice but to remand your client to the Stonehurst Psychiatric Facility for evaluation by a court appointed psychiatrist for a period of not less than and not more than 60 days. Your honor. The people deserve the right for a second psychiatric opinion. Oh very well Mr Deveti. This case is remanded until such time. Mr Shapiro, I'd like to see you in my chambers immediately. Yeah this is the ward lounge. You got your basic TV, your card table. Magazines, you know usual institutional stuff. Watch he's gonna set the whole place on fire. God damn Torchy. Fire bug. And these are your new playmates. Hey eat snot and die, ya landed on history. - I want science - Have fun. Well too bad, you landed on history. Since when did you learn how to read? You don't have to know how to read. They got symbols and this is symbol of history. Not science Sidney, history. You got 50 to one a heart to one 30. C'mon, c'mon. What would you do with cigarettes anyway, you don't even smoke. I bet ya $5 I could if I wanted to. 10 bucks says you're stupid idiots. Yeah $10 we're talkin' about. No bets? I quit. Well gee Sid, I guess that makes you the stupid idiot. Gentlemen, gentlemen please. We're all equal in the eyes of the lord. Mr Kelly? Or may I call you Soldier? Sidney Glassberg. It's an honor to make your acquaintance. You have a very impressive file. How do you know about my file? We read it. You read it. Joey over there, he has an amazing ability to procure things that don't belong to him. And you see Billy Ray? As ordained minister of my own church. I thought he looked familiar it's the TV evangelist that got caught in the sex scandal. He sort of gave new meaning to the expression laid on hands. What're you in for Sid? I'm just a simple computer professor and a compulsive gambler who spent my entire departments allotment on a field trip to Las Vegas. I lost it all. They had to let me go. Tough break. But not before I planted a computer virus. Wiped out all their research. $4 million worth of research and software. I don't know what came over me. Mr Kelly, the court has appointed me to assess your mental state. Suppose you tell me why you're here? I don't know, my lawyers a nut. Well, maybe he should be here. But until then how 'bout you? Do you think you belong in a mental institution? Doesn't make any difference to me. Look, let me rephrase the question, are you crazy Mr Kelly? No. Well if you're not crazy and you don't belong here, where do you belong? In jail. I killed four people, ya know? From what I understand, you felt they were responsible for the death of two kids who were under your supervision. Selling drugs is bad enough. But cuttin' it with poison. Let me ask you somethin'. When you doctors find a cancer, don't you wanna cut it out? Yes but we do it within the legal bounds of our profession. And my job is to determine why you overstepped your bounds. I want you good and ready. Just calm down Trevor. I'm gonna Kill you, you bitch. Look I understand your anger but why don't you let me go and we can talk about this? No first I'm gonna cut of your... I'm going to cut them off. I'm going to- - Trevor you're not gonna cut anything. Shut up. Mr Kelly I think you should just stay out of this. No no, I'm serious. You're not gonna cut shit with that knife Trevor. That blade would break on the first slice. You could cut up an apple, slice a few carrots maybe. To do the kinda damage you wanna do you need a real knife man. I'm talkin' Swedish steel and good strong handle. A six inch blade or eight inches that's even better. Yeah this is the only knife I got. That's too bad. I mean you look like the kinda guy who could really appreciate a good knife, ya know? I used to have a real nice one. - Oh. - But the cops took it away. Hey, I got something you might like. Yeah but I don't have any money. Oh that's okay. Trevor you keep this up and I'm not gonna help you get better. And Mr Kelly, that was totally uncalled for. I had the situation well under control. But thanks. Johnny Kelly's room. Oh yeah 412, right down there. Thank you. And now the mellow tones continue WWL, your listening station in- - Here I brought you some stuff the greater metropolitan area. Thanks when I get outta here can we go on a date? Will you give me a break Soldier? How am I supposed to know what to bring a guy in the loonie bin? A straight jacket would've been just fine. Saw you in court with Forrester. You two goin' steady? Yeah she's my new partner? How's that workin' out? A hell of a lot easier on the eyes than you are. How you feelin'? There's nothin' wrong with me man. Oh yes there is. You're a jerk. Is that your professional opinion? What the hell were you thinkin'? Wipin' out those scumbags didn't do shit. Franco had another pusher on the street before the bodies got cold. That didn't take the dirty dope off the streets. And another god damned kid died yesterday. Don't tell me, the departments conducting a full investigation? C'mon Soldier. Walkies. Go, go, go, go. 22 I could eat a horse. I told you he was a pervert. Hey where'd you guys get the Chinese food? Chan's over on Third Street. They let ya order in Chinese? Of course not, now that is a dumb question. Torchy picked it up. Torchy? Yeah. That's because Wong our regular delivery guy got sick. He's got an upset stomach or something. Yeah Wong is always sick. I think he's got somethin' wong with him. Wait a minute, let me get this straight. You guys do this all the time? I could leave here and come back and not be found out? Why would you wanna do that? People out there are crazy. And we wouldn't want that you should hurt yourself. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How does it work? How do I get outta here? You gotta play the game Soldier. What game? The game. Show time Sidney. Lunch, all right Weasel. Yeah you know, all this Chinese foods makin' me hungry. Hey thanks Wease. Is your man ready Sidney? Don't worry we'll be there. Good 'cause so will we. What was that all about? The game. You're gonna like the game. Tonight's the night. For what? The game Soldier boy. It's time to play the game. Herman, what game? Oh you'll see. The guys are waitin' for you upstairs, c'mon. So where we goin'? One flight up the stairs Soldier. Hi fellas, you look nice. Would somebody mind tellin' me what this game is all about now? Put 10 bucks on the other guy for me, okay? It's a race. A race? In a wheelchair. Tadaa. You wanna get out of here, don't you? Ah what the hell. Hey don't worry about it all new guys do it. It's just a little diversion for the boys. You guys are crazy. Yeah, yeah. Just a little diversion, huh? What the hell are you doin'? We don't want this to fall off. Well how come you're not strappin' him in? Oh he's not your opponent, he's a cripple. I know. He's my opponent. Naturally, he's the new guy in their ward. What's he in for? Oh nothin" he just killed a few people. Yeah, his mother, his father, his sisters, his brothers. The next door neighbor. All right all right. Where do we race to? Well you don't exactly race to somewhere. Yeah it's more like you race at each other. What? Sidney what's that man doing over there? Safety precautions. Yeah we don't want you to hurt yourself on that railing. First guy over loses. Okay, you guys. You've had your fun, it's been a slice. Now get me the hell outta here. What the hell is that? We thought you might want that. Why? "Cause he's got one. Look everybody, listen up. Tonight we have a very special treat for you. It's a benediction by the Wartol's famous evangelist. The former star of the TV show Sunshine over Patty. Look everybody. Thank you brother Weasel. Dear Lord, we thank you for giving us your unworthy servants, the opportunity to be in this place of healing. And we thank you for giving us arms and legs and muscles so that we may compete in events such as these. But most of all we thank you for putting strong hearts in our breasts and breasts on our women. Round, voluptuous breasts with nipples that stand erect and velvet skin thighs that wrap around us as we thrust and thrust and thrust and feel those tits. Bouncing boobs, I love tits. Thank you Billy Ray. Now what we've all been waiting for. Let the game begin. I wanted you to know that of all the money a lot of it's on the other guy. Yeah but we're your friends, we put our bucks on you. Yeah so don't let us down, okay? Help, I need help. I need help. Get outta here. Climb up, that's it, that's it. Keep coming. Keep goin' up. C'mon it's only one step. Max you're gonna be sleeping in for Soldier tonight. Hey perfect fit man. Okay Soldiers room is the third door down on the right. Have a good sleep. Yeah and don't be late. Tomorrow morning 6:30 he's off the clock. Oh I almost forgot somethin' you'll need this. Hey cutie. Mind if I squeeze by? Who are you? I'm Billy Ray's birthday gift. You're kiddin'? Billy Ray's somethin', he teaches me the bible. "Tis better to sow thy seeds in the belly of a whore "than to cast it by the way side." Oh yeah. I guess I missed that lesson in Sunday school. It was nice chatting with you. Yeah. Oh. Hey come this way often? Pizza comin' through. They should put a traffic light in here. Tito says one more pizza and you guys get your choice of toppings or a free antipasti. No shit? Now come on, we gotta make this one quick, I got business to take care of. You know who you lookin' at? You lookin' at the new man in town now that Raleigh got his ass blown away. But that kinda shit ain't gonna happen to me. No siree. I am too smart for that kinda shit, you understand? You understand? Lights out in five minutes Soldier. Shit. All I wanted to do was off the sucker. Look hold the bus Soldier, you're not the only one that wants revenge. My little sister Nicky is still in a coma and 'ma drop everyone of these cock suckers. Car's right over here. Your car? Yeah, for tonight. Soldier. We wastin' our time on these low lives man. At this rate we gon' wipe out half the ghetto. What are you talkin' about? I'm talkin' about let's go after the real big boys. I'm down. Speedboat listen to me, listen good. I got this whole thing figured out man, I don't want you gettin® yourself killed. You stay outta my way, okay? Man who you talkin' to with that shit? You supposed to be locked up with people that're wrapped too tight. If any usin's goin' on it's gonna be me usin' you. You're one screwed up individual Speedboat, you know that? Got any ideas? The Falconetti's? They don't have that much of a sense of humor. If 1 find out you're lyin' to me you fucks, I'll tear your heads off and shit in your necks. Okay and give my best to your mama. Those cocksuckers are lyin' to me and I know it. C'mon sir, the Falconetti's knockin' off a street pusher? That's just a start it's a fuckin' conspiracy okay? Talk about paranoid. Hey you'd be paranoid too if everybody was after ya. Four o' clocks here Sal. Okay. I believe that you might've been suffering from some kind of temporary seizure that was induced by the highly stressful situation you were under at the time. That sounds pretty serious. It is it's called psycho motor epilepsy and many successful defenses have been based on it. So now you're my lawyer? Look the DA is gonna send in another doctor to corroborate my findings. And if it's who I think it is he's gonna be pretty tough. We should give some serious thought to how we're gonna handle this. We? Well, yes I am your doctor. Well forget it. "Cause I'm not crazy. Soldier the key word here is temporary. Being crazy isn't like it used to be. Many criminal acts have been committed while the person was under some kind of emotional imbalance at the time. And with proper medical treatment, many of them have been restored to normalcy and they walk out of here free. So what do you think? I think you've got great legs. You know with that kinda talk, everybody's gonna think you're disgustingly normal including the DA. Damn it Julie, you god damn cripple. Gimme back those keys. Stop him, stop him. Mr Kelly? I should've known. Monday Gripp. Nice place you got here. It's a little on the sparse side but I guess they don't want you insane types killin' each other with the furniture. My card. Joel Shapiro, attorney at law. Where'd you get this? I found it. Where'd you find it? Lyin' on the ground. Where? Next to Shapiro's wallet. Speedboat please don't tell me that you ripped Shapiro off, okay? I couldn't tell the guard you were my brother. You better have something good man. Oh this is 24k. Old Salvatore Franco has got himself a coke lab and he's mixin' up a batch of some wack shit. Franco's got a coke lab? What'd I just say? Are you sure? I got a good source. Okay, all right. Can you get me a couple of fire extinguishers and a plumbing truck something small though, inconspicuous? Do shit stink? I give you a simple task man and look what happens. Does the word inconspicuous ring a bell? How about nondescript? Should I have used that word? That's the problem, you're too picky. I can't help it if a brother got creative. Are you sure this is a coke lab? Hey does little red riding hood like to get eaten? Hey, you got those pallets from AG? Yeah? What do you guys want? Mr Stinello called, he wants us to replace the fire extinguishers. You guys got an inspection comin' up. All right, over there on the wall. But don't go wonderin' around, wanna make sure I can see you guys. Get off my junk man. The boss says we replace the fire extinguishers. So I come down here on what's supposed to be my day off "cause this cheap prick won't give me no Sundays off. And you givin' me crap man? You know where I'd rather be? Garrett. I'd rather be home stickin' it to my old lady but no, I'm here replacin' fire extinguishers. Do you think I'm happy about that? First day on the job. Let me do my job. Hey. Can't go in there. Well what're you gonna do if there's a fire, piss on it? Yeah well wait a sec. Victor bring out your fire extinguisher. Shit the cokes burning, move it quick, now. Holy shit. I gotcha big, I gotcha. Come back here. Look Mr council man, they got the whole god damn warehouse. $11 million of inventory. No you jerk it wasn't noodles. Look, I want a full police investigation. Hey why not? I pay taxes. And I pay you Papagolis. I want those cops investigating. I wanna find out who's doin' this to me. And you can start with the Fabrini family. Okay good. My best to Ethel, ass hole. Yeah? Boss it's your four o clock. Okay. A little gift for you. Thank you. What'd you do that for? That's a reminder, you're Franco's girl now. You screw around with anybody else, you're dead meat. Soldier, have you ever heard of the Tannenbaum Personality Evaluation test? Yeah sure. Looks like two polar bears in a snowstorm. No. I meant this. Oh. Well? What do you see? An inkblot. I know it's an inkblot but do you see anything I don't know, sexual? Yeah. You do? I see a beautiful lady holding an ink blot. You're impossible. What happened now? Nothing. Nothing? Don't start okay. Franco thinks it's the Fabrini's. So what'd you have to do to get that? Oh the usual. Look I don't like this. I think we should stop this. Hey no way sugar, I'm not done. Besides, I am in the big mans house now. I'm his number one girl. You're his number one girl, Franco's? Forget it, it's over. Forget it okay? You dot want the information? I'll give it to somebody else. Lucinda. Yeah? For you. I'da baked you a cake but I'da had no file to put it in. You're a comedy store Speedboat what'd you find out? My we're touchy today. Tattoos must be heatin' up. Don't start. Okay, okay. Bruno is Franco's right hand man, right? Yeah. Well every Thursday he meets this bad man at this fancy restaurant. They come from all over the city. Must be zillions in that damn bag, it never leaves his side. What's the name of the restaurant? The Tratoria Transvestite. You sure about that? Do shit stink? It's up on Fifth Avenue. Besides all those fancy shops. Travestini. Trattoria Travestini. That what I said. Anyway, every Thursday at three o' clock they clear the place out so Bruno can do his business. He eats the same thing every time and he just sits there like a king takin' in all the treasure. Transvestite. Travestini. And breathe. Hey, Billy Ray is it true that we all come from clay? Why Torchy my son, good question. Clay is part of the soil, soil is dirt. Dirt is filth. And man must feel filthy to procreate. To form our families, to hear their desperate cries, to feel their milky thighs to make my penis rise. Oh help me spread their legs Lord or I'll die. Oh god I'm a horny guy. Inspirational. Okay so where were we? You got the bleach, ammonia, detergent, shaving cream? Nuts, bolts shit like that? Yeah, yeah. Can you give me some PD3? It's the stuff they use to clean clothes with. They got it, it's yours. Now I need somethin' to wipe the stuff up like paint or a spot of wood. Hey no problem man. Okay. Oh yeah pick me up a couple of Manneti's. What's Manneti? It's like a super laxative. Well I prefer prunes myself. Yeah take the coffee with ya, okay? Thank you bye, keep the coffee. Bye bye. Yeah. Sorry sir we're closed. Health inspectors. You guys were here last week. Snap inspection. Yeah there were dirty dishes in the kitchen. There is always dirty dishes in the kitchen. Yeah but these were really dirty. Follow me. Brilliant. Could you show me the restaurant facilities, please? Okay but don't tell the other guy. Can't you hurry this up, please? What is this shit man? This is the vongole sauce for the linguine. Well it smells like shit. Yeah as soon as my promotion comes through I'm gonna be in charge of foreign and domestic cuisines. And I could use someone with your restaurant experience. Yeah? You think so? Oh sure, I mean currently I'm training this big old dumb white guy but he's not workin' out so good. Bye. Did you put in the laxative? Did you use the whole thing? Do shit stink? We'll find out. Looks good. By all means Mr Marqueza. I sure hope you tell Mr Franco that we're doin' a fine job out here. Especially since add goal. Yeah sure Leroy. No Sir. The names Terrence. Yeah sure whatever. All these niggers are called Leroy. I am honored to serve you as usual Mr Marqueza. Linguine Vongole. Jesus Christ. What is it Bruno? I don't feel so good. Hey c'mon we'll eat later. Woo that garbage smells worse than that dude's sauce. Guess he really had to go. Unbelievable. Just fuckin' unbelievable. It was those god damn Fabrini's Guido and you know it. They've always been jealous pricks. I think we should take out the whole bunch of them. You get Manny, you get that restaurant guy. You find those two inspectors. You tear the city apart if ya have to. Well get the hell outta here. You know it's not bad enough these mobster creeps keep chopping each other up but when they start doing it in this neighborhood we have to know. I mean my mother shops around here for Christs sake. I'm beginning to think that Franco pissed of Superman. Either that or every crook in the city has been struck deaf, dumb and blind. Obviously one of these mafia guys has gone completely over the edge. Well you got that one right. Anyone who crosses Salvador Franco is definitely down a quart. Okay one, a person is not criminally responsible for his conduct if at the time of such conduct he lacks substantial capacity to know or appreciate either A, the nature and consequence of such conduct. Or B, that such conduct was wrong. So what does Soldier say to the DA? He should say "I'm sorry and I promise to never do it again.” C'mon Torchy get serious. The DA's man is comin' tomorrow. Okay, okay. Hey I got it, I got it. He should say that he just went in there to ask some questions when all of a sudden this junkie comes in with needle marks on his arms and his legs and his face and his penis. Although you didn't look there. And this junkie gets all pissed off and blows everybody away just like that. That's a really good story Torchy. I really believe somethin' like that especially when you tell 'em about the needle marks on the guys prick. They really like detailed shit like that. You gotta be a complete moron to believe that. Ah bite my butt Sidney. You know you think you know everything. Nobody's got a mind except you. Well okay Mr Smarty Pants. Mr Wise Guy. What should he say to the DA? You know what? If all your brains exploded at the same time, your hair wouldn't get parted. Soldier it's time for your session. In the people verses Lasgow, the court found that by merely fabricating an alibi. The defendant demonstrated that he was aware he committed a crime. He got life. In other words, if they catch you lying about the facts that proves that you knew right from wrong. Why else would you lie? Makes sense. So, the best defense is the devil made me do it. I could actually feel my spirit being lifted from my body. I could look down on the entire city and then he spoke to me. His voice was soft like a spring breeze. But his words had the strength of all the great army's of the world. "Jonathan” he said. He doesn't call me Soldier. "Purge my city of this great evil. "Yours is a holy mission." I see. You must've been very angry to do that to those people. Angry? No, no, no, no, no. Anger did not enter into this. I'm a Soldier. One of God's Soldiers. Ah then you're sorry now, right? I am not sorry. You're not? No. Look, you don't understand. I was just following orders. Hey what a nice surprise. Or did you finally get committed? Yeah. Soldier, it's over man. Can't use my contact no more. Things are gettin' rough and I'm gettin' worried about her. There's gonna be a big meeting at Franco's place. We gotta get her out. Sure. Just have her get the details of this one and she'll be done. No, it's over I'm serious, no more. What is this? Money? Tell her she'll be taken care of. It's not the money asshole. Hey what is your problem? A hooker can take care of herself. That hooker took a lot of risk for you dumb fuck. Speedboat. That hooker, that hooker is my sister. I didn't know, man. Fuck you man. Shit. C'mon we can fight. C'mon man, I'm not gettin' in the car. Mr Franco, there's been some terrible mistake. I swear I never even heard of this place, Transvistoria, Transatoria? I mean and the next thing I know, one of your goons is stickin' a gun up my ass. Now hey, I'm willin’ to forget the whole thing if you are. Just shut up nigger. Freako c'mere. You gonna have any trouble with this jig? No trouble at all Mr Franco. Look, don't screw up with him okay? I need him broken, not dead. No problem. There better not be. I'll bring him in during the meeting, I'll ask him who his boss is, when he says Fabrini, we'll blow his god damn head off. I'll show those asshole who's in control here. What if it's not the Fabrini's? Well then make him say it. Get him downstairs and get him ready. This marks the third ceasefire in the 20 month uprising. And on the local front, the drug war continues. With another gangland style Killing. Police are calling the explosion that rocked the Tratoria Travestini, killing number one Franco henchmen, bru- - Hey Soldier, Herman says your lawyers secretary's here to see ya. She's waiting in your room. Sure about that huh, Joey? That's what he says. Who are you? Lucinda Petracelli. Mr Shapiro asked me to come down and have you sign these papers. Can we talk? You're Speedboat's sister? Yes. We've gotta move fast. A couple of Franco's goons picked up Speedboat and they're holding him at the mansion. Shit. Franco's having some big drug meeting there tonight and they wanna make an example of Speedboat. We gotta do something quick. Okay. I'm afraid they're gonna Kill him. Don't worry. Mr Simpson please confiscate Mr Kelly's gear. And escort him to isolation. You're makin' a mistake. I don't know what you've been doing and I don't wanna know but it's gonna stop right here. You help Goliath. Now Goliath help you. Come I know a way out. You leavin' now? No can't go, go ahead. Welcome Torrez. Everybody has a drink? Salute. All right let's get down to some business. As you know, I control the five most important sectors in this city. The scraps, I leave for the dogs to fight over. What about volume? My annual sales are equal to or greater than the total gross national product of your country Mr Torrez. My income is bigger than the gross national product of my country. I love this business. C'mon talk. A, B, C, D. Don't be a fool go to school. Man that is one tough chicken bone. Hey are you gonna co operate? Or are we gonna have a little accident tryin' to escape? Hey scumbag, why don't you stick that gun up your ass and blow your brains out. Shit. Sorry phone is no longer in service. Hey Matty, it's Roberto you wanna check camera three? It looks like there's rain on it or something. Got you Roberto. Yeah rain and rain. I think Roberto's been locked up to long in that room. Why don't you go check it out? Somebody got in. Shit c'mon. In there. What the hell was that? You son of a bitch, you guaranteed my safety. What is going on here Franco? If I smell my own blood my people will take this place apart brick by brick. Just try and be calm will ya? Whatever it is, we got it under control. Yeah Guido, this is Franco. What's up? Oh yeah? Ah good work. Okay well finish up there and come back here with some more men. Those god damn Fabrini's. They got no brains, okay? The guy who just rebuilt the vault over at Fort Knox is my interior decorator. Everything is under control. We are perfectly safe. Speedboat. I'll take that. Drop the belt. I'm gonna enjoy this. Yeah. Here's Johnny Law. My hero. Who torches this neighborhood? Take it easy, take it easy. Go nice and slow. Can you walk? Yeah. Don't, you'll fry. If word on the street is reliable, this could be a big one. This'll be bigger than the time Commissioner Hurley got caught at the gay Apollo. I guess they're already inside. That's Franco's office. They're having some sort of meeting goin' on with all the big drug dealers. Watch our backs. Not even a nuclear bomb could open that door. We can't get in but nobody's gettin' out unless there's another way. I'll handle this one. Save yourself deputize. Just call me Johnny Law. You sure these things work? Does shit stink? Mine sure do brother. Get the hell outta here. Holy moly. What the hell's that? Shit those guys are Killin' each other in there. This is the poison they cut the drugs with. Those scumbags aint human. This little altercation is resolved. So we figure out a way to make the deliveries. What about the Fabrini's? The Fabrini's? The Fabrini's are nothin', they can't hurt me. Take off your shirt and cover your mouth. That's my proposal. I think it's fair and equitable for all concerned. Any comments, questions? What the hell is that? Get us outta here now, Franco. Now. It's jammed, the systems jammed. It'll be a lot faster if we turn the thermostat to full blow. We have an eight 10 in progress at Salvador Franco's mansion. There's one man down. We need back up and an ambulance. I repeat, back up and an ambulance. Holy shit. I don't believe it. What are you doin' here? I shoulda known you had something to do with this. By the way, it goes without saying you're both under arrest. Rotter? You don't wanna go in there. You're god damn right I wanna go in there. You're right, I don't wanna go in there. You don't wanna go in there. Here Sidney, here's some hot questions for ya. What do you suppose we play now, Torchy? Hey I got an idea. Let's play pyro Monopoly. If 1 land on your hotel I burn it. Not if I kick your ass first. Oh any hotel except yours Joey. Why can't we just play chess or cheesy or poker, maybe? Hey you guys hear, there's a new guy comin' to the floor. Some black kid. I don't know why I have to keep doin' this Speedboat there's nothing wrong with your hands. But baby, Speedboat's so weak. And 'ma need all my strength if 'ma show you a good time. Oh Speedboat. Nah really. Right after I get outta here, 'ma come by your place. Pick you up in my car. What kinda car you got? What kinda car you like? I like Porsches. I got one of those. How are you baby? Oh I'm feelin' all right. That just my sister, my sister. Where you goin'? My sister. Where you goin'? Oh I'm feelin' all right sis. Yo Shaft. How you doin'? You guys are gonna make me take early retirement. Soldier told me to stop by to see how you were makin' out. But the good news is, your sister Nicky's in the clear, man. No complications. All right, all right I'm feelin' better already. So how you livin’ sister, you bein' careful out there? I am now Mrs Heather Q Remington of Glendale, Arizona. I have a new ID, a bodyguard and a place to live. I'm startin' all over brother. That's cool. Thanks man. Hey don't thank me, Soldier threatened to rejoin the force unless I did somethin' about it. Soldier. I miss that knucklehead. It says here that "The people find the defendant "Johnathan J Kelly, not guilty by reason of insanity.” It calls you unfit to stand trial and remands you for an indefinite period to this medical facility for rehabilitation. Well Soldier, we've got a lot of work ahead of us. You're the doc.
