BLOOD WEDDING Hi. We're here. Hi. Cristina, you're here. Where do I sit? Antonio, here. And you, here. Hi. In the back. - Hi, kid. - Hi. And our dressing room? Over there. Upstairs. - Shall we go upstairs? - Let's go. Anyone have an aspirin? Give it to me later. José. - What? - Where's the photo? Here it is. Can I have the mirror? Stay. Don't fall. Everything is where it should be. I'm going to get a bit of make-up... I left a sponge here the other day... Grab another one. Don't make-up his mouth, he's got fat lips! Let's get rid of his donkey face. You and I are alike, such noses. - What are you doing? - Your face! This won't do... It's a half tone higher. It's the same as always. That's too high! Look! Look! See? That's you! It was higher the other day. It's fine, I tuned it with Toñin's pipe. Not the eyebrows! Once more. And your cap? You want me to get pneumonia? Toñin, José. Look! Let's run through Cristina's part... You know, the voices: "Awaken..." That's it. You too. That's right. That's it. Wake up the bride, wake her up with the green bouquet of flowering love, with the green bouquet of flowering love. Let the singers make their rounds, and put a crown on each balcony. Let the singers make their rounds, and put a crown on each balcony. Wake up the bride, wake her up. Wake up the bride, wake her up. The morning of the wedding. The morning of the wedding... Good. Now, Toñin. Keep it like that. Good. Good. I'm great! When I started to dance... ...it was a necessity, out of hunger. I wanted to study... ...but that was impossible, I had to work. I was eleven years old. First I was a bellboy. At 14, I went to work in the "ABC" newspaper... ...in the print shop. I tried everything, even boxing. But after the first blow, I said: "Never again". Next I tried cycling. Anything! Until a neighbor by chance suggested dancing... ...and I took classes at an academy. I danced like a child. I knew nothing. I studied under "Palitos". A while later, a black man, Harry Fleming, saw me. He had a show... ...a cabaret show. I thought I'd be dancing flamenco... ...he gave me a mambo shirt and a bongo. I accompanied the "Princess" Menet... She danced the mambo... ...and I played the bongo. A friend recommended me to Pilar López. What happened was that I realized... ...I wasn't going anywhere. I had no background. All I did was repeat what I was taught. And I decided to leave Pilar Lopez' ballet. I stayed in Paris. I studied dance, contemporary painting... ...other forms of art, and saw the shows. I'd never seen Vicente Escudero dance... ...only a couple of his pictures. Pilar said I was just like him when he was young. Even physically we were very similar... ...large hands with tapered fingers like birds of prey... ...the same nose, our features... Mariemma, a friend of his, was astounded. She said the resemblance was frightening. I'd never seen him dance, or in person. And one day... ...he came to see me dance. The man who never gave his approval. Never, in his whole life... He came to see me. It was as is he were my grandfather... ...and I the grandson he'd always wanted. He was very fond of me. He was a man of great dignity... ...very serious and no fooling around. He always did what he believed he had to do. He never sold himself... ...and he died with amazing dignity. I really respected him. He never acted like so many other artists do. He was... So, when I went to Paris... ...I sent him a card. "Maestro, etc..." He wrote back telling me I was living... ...in the same place he lived for nearly 20 years. Rue Boulanger, number 36. That's it. But not so fast. We'll stop here. Again. Not so fast, not so fast. Let's see. Is everyone here? Let's start with this... Watch! The first four steps with your arms here. The next four, arms out... ...and then in. First out, then in. And at the end... ...your arm is here... ...outstretched. Let's start! One and two... Understood? Let's go! One and two... Arms higher! Hold your back! So-so... The end is not quite... The head... Your head here and then facing forward. One and two... Up! Your back! What a mess. Sorry. Sorry. What a mess. Ready? One and two... Up! Alright. Everyone got it? The head. Let's take it from the last two. With our arm raised? One and two... Up! Good. That's better... Now, let's do this... 1, 2, 3... ...4, 5, 6... ...7, 8, 9, 10. 1, 2, 3... ...4, 5, 6... ...7, 8, 9, 10. Watch! Hold it, don't let go. Make your back hold it! Let' see. Your head in profile... ...then face forward. - With our arm out? - At all times. - And... - Quiet. - How many times? - Four. One and two... Let your body fall! Better! The back! Bodies down! Stretch! Down! Stretch! Head! As Escudero used to say: "Straighten out". Straighten out. - Shall we go again? - Yes. Let's see. I'll watch. Do we move our wrists? Now, wait a beat. Hold your back... ...stretch the fall. Hold it. Alright. It doesn't matter. Alright, good... Let's see the diagonal. Give me the beat. Please... Don't just fall. Hold on to it. We'll each do a bar. Diagonally. Now, one after another. Please. Everyone else claps. Eyes ahead of you! Don't raise your eyebrows! A little bit more! Stretch, Lario, stretch! Good, good. You're all warmed up? Okay. Let's change and begin the rehearsal. - Full dress rehearsal? - With everything. - We're ready? - Yes. - Where do you come from? - Bollullo. What did you bring me? 25 cents. Scratch here, and here, for this is yours! Oh, God! How's my hair? Awful. My shoes are killing me. I think they're shrinking. You're really sweating! Of course I am! Aren't you? Just wait and see. My feet hurt. These shoes... - Are they new? - No. But... they always hurt. - What's the matter. - I'm very nervous. - Why? - Do you think it will work? Of course! It will all work out. Antonio is nervous as well and look! You're in great form. How's your knee? It hasn't bothered me at all for a long time. I was worried yesterday, during the fight. It always pops at the same point. I've gotten used to it... ...to the noise. Your knives. Let's see. Show me another. Not this one. I'll take this one. Here, Juan. - Which is mine? - Careful, one's no good. Turn it over. That's fine. Want a pin? Can you help me? I'll do yours after. Can you hook me up? - Well, girls. Break a leg. - Same to you. Thanks. Attention please. Please. Please sit down where you are to enter... ...so you won't... ...be passing behind. Except those who have to. Nobody else! I'm not going to stop, no matter what happens. We're not going to stop. Daniel, pass everything out. The knives and all the rest. You have your knife? I'll give it to you later. Give it to José Luis. Pilar, you ready? Yes. Paco, music, please. My child sleeps... ...my child is quiet... ...his crib is of steel... ...his blanket from the Low Countries. Sleep child, sleep. Sleep child, sleep. Oh, mighty horse... ...you refused my water. Do not come, do not enter... ...run to the hills. Through the gray valleys... ...where the mare is. My child sleeps... ...my child rests. Sleep carnation... ...the horse will not drink. Sleep rambling rose... ...the horse is crying. Wake up the bride, wake her up... Wake up the bride, wake her up with the green bouquet of flowering love, with the green bouquet of flowering love... Let the singers make their rounds, and put a crown on each balcony. Let the singers make their rounds, and put a crown on each balcony. Wale up the bride, wake her up... Wake up the bride, wake her up... The morning of the wedding... The morning of the wedding... The morning of the wedding... In a green meadow I hung my handkerchief... I hung my handkerchief... Three roses fell like falling stars... Like falling stars... The carriage was very expensive... To take the bride and groom to the wedding... To take the bride and groom to the wedding... Get up and sleep no more... Get up and sleep no more... It's going to be tomorrow... It's going to be tomorrow... Black ribbon, black hair, like that brunette... Who with her jealousy drained my veins of blood... There is shaking in your wings, of an unlucky young girl... Crying pains of love, crying pains of love... Under the light of the moon. Under the light of the moon. My hat, my hat... you're a treasure of grace... You have a bullfighter's might when I take you to the bullfight. I love you because on your brim, my dearest hat, you line with charm the kiss of a woman. You're steady as a hammer, you're so distinguished, you're king of the chariots and of the Virgin of Rocio. On your sweet brim, your laments fly once again... From promises of love, from promises of love, later taken by the wind... Under the light of the moon... My hat, my hat, you're a treasure of grace... You have a bullfighter's might when I take you to the bullfight. I love you, because in your brim, my dearest hat, you line with charm the kiss of a woman. The newlyweds sang, water passed, and the wedding arrived. Let the house shine and fill the almonds with honey... The newlyweds sang, water passed, and the wedding arrived. Let the house shine and fill the almonds with honey. Set the table, get the wine ready, because the groom's a pigeon with a silver chest, waiting in the field, for the course of spilled blood. The singers made their rounds, they made their rounds, they made their rounds and water passed...
