[♪♪♪♪♪] [WOMAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [LAUGHING] [SCREAMS] No. [MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [LAUGHS] WOMAN: Alba, Alba, my sweet child. This is my daughter, Alba. I adopted her when she was a little baby. My constant nightmare is that she cannot breathe. [WATER RUNNING] She sometimes sleeps with me. She wants to protect me from my nightmares. Dad? Are there not food rations for all of us? This is ridiculous, for God's sake. -We just need to be patient. -But this is a national crisis. All the plants in the world are dying, and nobody knows why. What is like for you to start this highly publicized collaboration with the most powerful man in the world, in the midst of this global crisis? It is extremely challenging. I'm home. WOMAN: California, Christmas Eve, Sorry I'm late! Alba's been waiting, watching the Sonya Antonov interview. Alba? He is the only hope for our planet. They say he's a genius. Yes. Hi, Mom. Hey. Yes, with all my heart. So you were wrong to blame him before? No... Well, he's supporting my, my work right now and this is the most important thing. You fought against engineering life, and now you are working hand and hand with him? When the world population goes from six to ten billion people overnight, engineered food is a god-- Listen, he tried to help all the world, but something went terribly wrong. and now, everything he's been working for can disappear if I don't do something. But what can you do? It's inevitable, it says it in the Book. What book? The Bible. It says right there, the last chapter. Alba's obsession with religion and Sonya Antonov are the two big mysteries of my life. Maybe, but we're all starving, and the food has quickly disappeared from our tables and we're all living on small rations now. Dr. Cera... do you believe in God? I don't. I can't help but ask you, it's about Alba. Christ will forgive us, and he will help us... but if we love one another. It's the only way. You have to believe. You have to have faith. You have to seek salvation... but only if we love one another. Hello, Mister Preacher. How are you today? Hey, Alba. Well, I am just preaching away, as usual. Alba, Alba. What are you doing talking to this man? And, he knows your name? Yeah, we talk every day. When I stop by on my way back from school. Serghey likes him, too. He's a very nice man. Hi. I'm John. And you are the world-famous scientist Dr. Beatrix Cera. Did you have to tell him my name? Look it, I am sorry Doctor. No. Alba and I only speak about the Lord. I've seen your picture on all the magazine covers and in all the news stories. Everybody knows who you are. My mother's going to speak at the submit tomorrow. I heard. So you're the "New Hope"? Well, nobody wanted to listen before, but tomorrow they will and everything will change. I know. True hope has been lost. Faith, only prayer can save us. Or science. You are a fighter, Doctor. However, above it all-- Above it all, man shall succeed. I'm sorry, Mr. John, the Preacher, but I don't have time for a religious debate. We have to go home now. -ALBA: Goodbye. -Goodbye. Thank you. [♪♪♪♪♪] Sweetheart. Bread. Thank you, sir. Have a Merry Christmas. Have a Merry Christmas. -Hi, John. -Hi. This looks wonderful. Hey, John. Thank you. [♪♪♪♪♪] John, we're out of food, and the line outside is getting longer. Well, um, go talk to Larry at the market. He'll give you more. I have to leave soon myself. Are you going to be back for the mass? I'll try. CROWD: No, no, GMO! No, no, GMO! MAN: All right, here she comes! Let's go, let's go. [REPORTERS CLAMORING] CROWD: No, no, GMO! No, no, GMO! No, no, GMO! No, no, GMO! No, no, GMO! No, no, GMO! No, no, GMO! No, no, GMO! World-renown etymologist Dr. Beatrix Cera arrives... Does this mean I'm gonna get my sushi this year? Dude, shut up! It's starting. ...genetically engineered foods. New World Genetics called this emergency summit to combat the international food crisis. Misseur Doctor, Beatrix Cera... [speaking Japanese] New World Genetics Laboratory. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] There's no way we're getting in there. I'm going to find another way. No, no, GMO! No, no... Dr. Cera will explain why all the vegetation on the planet is dying. My dear people, thank you for being here. The leaders of the world, thank you for being here, as well. Today is the biggest day in our history, and we're all here to share it together... as one big family of our beloved Earth. I am going to introduce you to the most dedicated and pertinent scientist of all times. Dr. Beatrix Cera is going to explain the situation to you all. Please let's give a big round of applause for Dr. Beatrix Cera. [APPLAUSE] Thank you, United Nations. New World Genetics has started to engineer the food in order to meet the needs of a fast-growing population worldwide. New World Genetics has created better food. Food for everybody. But during the process, a very unfortunate event has occurred. The change in the DNA sequence of the newer generations of plants, has triggered a self-defense mechanism and, now, the plants are attacking the foreign gene. Meaning, that they actually began to self-destruct. This year's harvest of wheat, corn, rice and soy has died... unexpectedly. The honey bees, which account for 80% of our world pollinators have been spreading the affected pollen from the genetically modified plants... to all of the rest. And because the entire vegetation of our planet functions like one unit, like one single organism... now all the plants around the globe... are killing their seeds. Soon, there will be no more fruit in the world. There will be no more food to feed the animals. [CROWD CHANTING] You made it. No one else is here, right. The mob is insane. All of the reporters. Everybody, all of them. She's going to speak today, okay? I saw her escorted by armed soldiers. It's going to be one hell of a day. Let's go. Stop. You need to back off now. -Can I just talk to you? -It's okay. It's okay. Can you let me in please? Come on, important day. No, no more reporters. Oh, come on, one more reporter. They won't notice. It's extremely late. It has already started. There will be no empty seats. You don't have clearance. I'd most likely lose my job and my food rations. So no. Wait, how about this for clearance, hm? -Let's go. Follow me. -Thank you. We do, however, have federal food reserves that will last us maybe three months. [ARGUING] Everybody, please, silence. Dr. Cera is just giving you some facts. But, she's got the solution, too. Before all the bees perished, Dr. Cera managed to save a few healthy bee eggs. And she's going to clone them into special bees. The honey bees have this anomaly that is a gift, actually. It is called thelytoky. It is a type of parthenogenesis in which females are produced from unfertilized eggs. The social Hymenoptera can naturally clone themselves. The gene that I have isolated. Our scientist will transfer this new gene in all the patented New World Genetics seeds and create new plants. Immortal plants. And once humans and animals are fed our new food, the new gene will make its way through the human and animal DNA. I call it the Immortality Gene. I am working on transferring it to my new population of bees, so their cells will begin to clone automatically. And make us all... immortal. World leaders, we need you to sign my pact and become a part of the New World Genetics Survival Program. We need your help. I would like to introduce you to the Nobel Prize Laureate for Medicine... the man behind the cure for cancer. He agreed to be here today, in an effort to save the world. Please, ladies and gentlemen, let's give a big round of applause for Dr. John Zachary. Thank you, friend of the world. And thank you, Dr. Cera. What you say is true. It has begun... the Apocalypse. But do you people think that it started with companies like New World Genetics altering of life? With the pollution? The pesticides? No. It started a long time ago. It started when we told God that we don't need Him anymore and we welcomed in the Other One. And he became our new resident, our resident evil. And it's true, we conquered the plague that is cancer. But a new disease will arise... deadlier... stronger... I mean do you think if we created immortal life, that we, as human beings, will become kinder? That we will become more generous? No. You will be dead in immortality because your soul will belong to the Other One. Is it too late? No. But we must humble our backs and beg for forgiveness. We must ask our Christ to come down to save us. We must ask Christ, Our Lord, to come an evict our new resident from our minds and from our hearts. We must surrender to prayer and to faith. That is only way we will survive. That is the only way to be immortal. Love is immortal. Christ is love. Love one another. Love one another, now and forever and you will survive the end of times. Merry Christmas, children of God. Hello, Doctor. Hello. You are the crazy billionaire that gave his fortune away and left the world? And now, you're preaching on the corner of my street... about paradise. About penitence. So you really think your Christ will come from the sky and save you because you repent. I know that Christ will come back, and only those that repent will be saved. You obviously understand that Dr. Zachary speaks metaphorically. Yes, we are at the end of times. But we're not here to acknowledge our extinction... but to unveil the elixir... for eternal life. -John, John. -Yes. I want to ask you something. Sure. People listen to you. What do you tell those who don't care about anything you said in there? Jesus, now the joke of trendy people, was, is, and always has been love. I guess that is what I would tell them. What about those that reject Him? If there was anything else to say, I guess it would be "That it's never too late". Have a good evening. We will not perish... but transform. We will become stronger and more resilient than ever. We have already conquered the Earth. Now, we will conquer all death. Hi. Hi. Dr. Cera, that was a powerful speech. Have you known Dr. Zachary for a while? I know him. He's my best friend. -Ah. -It is so strange. He used to be a force of nature and now... Now? Now, he's homeless. He's preaching on the corner of our street about love. It's what Jesus has taught us, to give love. Well, I never met the Doctor. I only met the homeless man. Hmmm. Excuse me. May I have a moment alone with Dr. Cera, please? Oh, yeah. Sure. Thank you. Wow, you were amazing. Why did you let him speak? Yes, the world needs to hear his crazy theories before they doubt him. Why would they doubt him? He has a Nobel Prize for curing cancer! He's been feeding all the homeless people in the country. [LAUGHING] While preaching to them from under a bridge. He's preaching about love to people that forgot what it is like to be loved. And tomorrow, his money won't have much to buy, and love doesn't feed their bellies. But our new food will. We will feed the homeless, and they will love us back. Will they love him then? No. They will hate him for his annoying noise about repentance and hell. [SIGHS] Let's go celebrate. All right? You and I... we will save the world. Your part is waiting for you. Dr. Beatrix Cera will create the immortal bee, from there, she will open a path to create the immortal plants and food crops. Humanity will thrive and soon conquer death. We dare you, Apocalypse. The new human being is not afraid. SONYA: The Nobel Prize Laureate, Dr. John Zachary, has left the building, after casting his Apocalyptic words on humanity. He was not available for an interview, but we're hoping to locate him and learn more about how he's planning on applying love today on the people that soon will start killing for food. This is Sonya Antonov with today's news. MAN SINGING: Glory of Christ You have tasted The Fountain Of Immortality Receive the Body Of Christ. Taste the Fountain Of Immortality You have... I didn't think you'd show up. But I did. You did, thank you. Don't. We will still win this. He will leave you alone in the world. He won't help you save her. His will be done. You will deny his name in front of me. Even if I have to die for Him... I will never deny Him. And we didn't make it to church. No, sweetie, I'm sorry. We didn't. We never make it. Anyways, I want to give these presents to the homeless children. Do you mind? No, honey, of course I don't mind. But I'll keep this. Mom, can I ask you something? Since when do you need my permission. This is serious. Shoot it. Well, you said today that you are going to create the immortal bee. Yeah. But, God created the bee. Well, apparently, He didn't do the best job. But His creation is perfect. Alba. We live in an age, now, where we can create life ourselves. But Mom, what about God? What about Him? Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. Come over here. I'm so sorry. Oh, I'm so, so sorry. Listen. I didn't grow up learning about God. I grew up learning about the man and his accomplishments. And, I became a scientist. And now only scientists can save the world [KNOCK ON DOOR] I'm sorry. I saw the lights were still on. And we were about to turn them off. -Alba. -That's all right. I wanted to tell you before you saw it on TV. All the leaders of the world signed the pact. That's it. I'm ruling the world as of today. Over the President? Over the President. Without me, the world will collapse. With me... The world will become immortal. [SCOFFS] Alba... I'm sorry. She's just a kid. Yes, just a kid. Alba might come back. I am... I, I understand. Maybe you should get some rest. -Yes. -These are for you. Have a good night. [SIGH] [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [CRYING] Mommy? Mommy. It's okay. I'm here. You're having a nightmare. Oh, oh, baby. You know how much I love you, don't you? I know, Mommy. Merry Christmas, Mr. Serghey. Merry Christmas to you, too, Miss Alba. Merry Christmas, Madame Dr. Cera. Hi, Serghey. Sorry we're late. I got a present for you. Good for protection, the mother of Jesus. It will help you in case of illness. -Makes miracles. -What's that? It's an icon. Oh, Serghey, I always thought you were an old communist. Sorry, Madame, but I thought Alba likes it. It's from my mother. It helps you in case of illness. It just heals. -Thank you, years of medicine. -Can I keep it, Mom? You can, as long as you take your antibiotics. when you're sick. -Okay, let's go. -Okay-- Wait, um... Did that man, Mr. John, tell you where his church was? Yes, Mommy. Thank you. I love you, Mommy. It's called the Holy Trinity. Oh, I know where it is. They give lunch and shelter to all of the town's homeless people, so let's go. Well, Alba has some presents for the children. -Oh. -Can you help her? Sure, let's go. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. Here. Thank you. Merry Christmas. God bless you. Everybody is gone. You may go inside. Mass is over, and you may pray in silence. Miss Alba. Come to me, please. Stay with me. Put your fingers together like this. Up, down, right, ... What are you doing? Praying. -Our Father, who art in Heaven -Our Father, who art in Heaven Hallowed be thy name, thy Kingdom come... Hallowed be thy name, thy Kingdom come... You came. [CHUCKLES] Oh, Alba wanted to bring her presents here for the children. Thank you. We should go. Dr. Cera. Call me Beatrix. Beatrix, okay. You have something you want to ask me. It's just that I can't stop thinking... Yes? About you. How, how, how can you donate billions of dollars... and be just... Poor? Yeah. Be left with nothing. How are you going to help people now? Well, it's simple really. I talk to them. I hope to teach them. So what do you think will happen? They will become better. They will love one another. And that they will believe in Christ. Oh, you really believe that your Christ will come and judge all of us. Yes, and soon. "Behold, I come quickly and my reward is with me. I render all men according to their own work. I am the Alpha and Omega, the first and last... -the beginning and the end." -[LAUGHS] I'll make that bee, so I'll make sure your God doesn't have to show up. -Beatrix? -Yes? W-Why are you so angry? Oh, I thought you were a preacher, not a shrink. Well, I sensed it. I didn't mean to upset you. You have Alba. She adores you. The world adores you. You should be happy. You don't know my life. You don't know what I've been through I know you've been through a lot. That's why you reject God. Hi, Mr. John, so happy we're meeting here today. Even if the mass has ended. I am so glad that you came, and I wish you a Merry Christmas. You, too, Mr. John. I have something for you. I know you'll like this. It is my Christmas gift to you. Thank you. Thank you. We should go now. It's really late. I hope to see you soon, Beatrix. Ma'am, we gotta go right now. -What's going on? -We gotta go. -We gotta go now. -Alba, come on. -Come on, come on. -Serghey, come on. -Just go along! -Go. Please get in. We can't just leave. What about the others, my work, my files? It's been shipped. Please get in. Dr. Cera, Colonel Krewiss. It's an honor to have you here. Hello. Hello. Hi. Anything you need. I'm at your service. -Your quarters are this way. -I am not going to my quarters. Where is he? -You need to see him right now? -Yes! I'll have two of my soldiers escort you. -That way. -Take good care of Alba please. -I will. -I'll take it. -I am Serghey. -Serghey, nice meeting you. This way. -This is Alba. -Hello, Alba, nice meeting you. Your quarters are right in here. [GRUNTS] Grab everything, grab everything. Look. Grab everything. There's nothing in here. Keep looking. Let's go. Let's go. Now. -Hey, go back there. Check, now. -You got it. Where are you gonna sell these? That's not even real gold. It ain't worth nothin'. Forget about it. Let's just leave. Here, take this. It will definitely sell. Don't take it. It's bad luck Take it. It will help you in times of need. All right, it's all here. Give this to the Colonel. You're dismissed. Bea, please don't angry with me. Angry? I am ready to kill you! We have to save everybody, not just us. I had to protect us first. Do you know John, well? Why do you want to know? I just do. I know you are thinking about him. I can feel it. Attention on deck. As you were. It's done. We took all the food we could off the shelves. and out of the warehouses in the country. It is all being transported right here. They'll be left with half rations for a little while. And the people? Whoever signed the pact will be here shortly. She'll never find out. So has she started working yet? She will soon. Are we sure we can rely on her? Of course. Okay, sir. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Mom, I have no clothes. No pajamas. Nothing. I'm sorry, sweetie. This is just temporary. This looks clean. I have to go to work now. But, I'll be back soon. I promise. It's okay, Mom. Go. Gotta go. -Doctor. -Colonel. Well, we have the last of the flowers. Oh. And we brought clothes for you and your daughter. You went through my things? I apologize, Doctor. It was an emergency. The riots already started we had to. Thank you. Put them over there, please. -Colonel Krewiss. -Yes. I am really sorry for yelling at you earlier. It is just that the bees are so fragile. This, this whole move could have been fatal. There is no need to apologize. I respect your work. And the world is depending on you. So tell me, why is it so hard to clone these bees. From what I understand, they are cloning all kinds of things. It is not hard to clone them. It is hard to make them immortal. Understood. Good luck. Thank you. Don't worry about it. We'll make it work. Ah. It's all gonna be okay. I hope so. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] NEWSCASTER: The food shortage is becoming more alarming. Food rations are getting less and people are rioting in the streets. There are no trees. There are no blossoms on trees. The cattle are dying, as there has not been food available for months. Juicy steaks are no longer a delight but a memory. Little girl, just one strawberry for you. That's it. Please, sir. We're a larger family. Certainly, we can pay more. Sorry, señor. [SPEAKS SPANISH] One fruit, one jar. Guy, this is all we have. You have a sister, Nina? Yes, I do. She's sick at home. My mother takes care of her. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Ah, look, the legs are moving... but the wings aren't fully developed. [GASPS] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hi. Hello. Dr. Zachary, I'm-- I know who you are. Please come in. What can I help you with? I'm trying to find Dr. Cera. I've been looking everywhere for her. She just vanished. I need to talk to her. I haven't seen her since Christmas. But, where could she be? She was supposed to save us all. What if she's dead? I pray that she's not. Do you think it's happening right now? -The Apocalypse? -Yes. But what can we do? We're all gonna die? Please. "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them. And judgement was given unto them, and I saw the souls of them beheaded, for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God, and which had not worshiped the beast in his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or on their hands, and they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years." A thousand years is a very long time. People interpret it differently. It simply means the time before the second coming of Christ. And Satan? "Satan shall be loose out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the nations, which are in the four quarters of the Earth." We should tell the people. We've been telling them. Right. Do you pray? [BUZZING] Oh, no, no. Don't worry about it. We gotta do it again. [SLOW-MOTION TALKING] [GASPS] [SIGHS] Alba, sweetie... go to sleep. Mommy? Where do you think Mr. John is right now? Oh, I don't know, honey. I was just wondering. Mom, do you know about the dying rooms? I don't remember exactly, something about China. August 15th. Traveling through the region of Guan Chee, China. Hidden from the foreigners' eyes is the orphanage. There were just two social workers around alone with a hundred little girls. They let me in, and that's when I saw her. She was only one day old. Her mother abandoned her here, cause she was a girl. The staff had tied her small body to a bed and left her there, soaked in urine and feces, along with the other baby girls. They were all crying. One hundred baby girls crying. They would only come when the noise stopped, to make room for others. These are the dying rooms. The government has denied the existence of such places. Fragments of an Entomologist's Journal,by Sonya Antonov. Did you choose me? I couldn't save all of them. I couldn't. -I had to-- -Pay for me? They wouldn't let an unmarried woman adopt a child. I stole you. I hid you in my parka, and I ran. You were so sick. You weren't even crying. When I got to the lab... you had died at my breast. My team took you away to hide you. Bury you. And that's when I made a promise. I'd love you and cherish you. And give my soul in exchange for your life. And, that's when I heard the baby cry. He showed up from nowhere... holding you. You were mine. -I love you, Mommy. -I love you. I thought the orphanage was a big secret. One million baby girls are killed in China every year, and America does nothing. That's why your mommy has dedicated her life to create the immortal bees. So we could feed the whole world. And not care about the overgrowing population in China, India... so beautiful girls, like you, can grow happily. But you took all the food from the stores. What? How does that follow your declarations? My mom doesn't know what you did. But I understand things. I look at you and I know. Funny enough, you live up to your real name. [SPEAKS CHINESE] Has your mommy here told you who she gave her soul to? Stop it. Stop it right there. This farm is one of the many vandalized farms across California, the number one food supplier of the United States. Now, it is just a deserted field, with no crops to grow. -What you got? -I got two. All right, pay the man. There you go. What you got? I don't have anything, but come on. Come on please, can I have some food. No money, no food. Man, if you ain't got money. Whoa! Hey, if you ain't got money, we can work something out. Hey, respect man. She has a baby. Don't you see. -Relax. Okay. All right. -Respect, okay. I have the money, look. I don't know how much it is, but I have it. Can have I some food, please? I'll get you some food. And I'll help you out, okay? Just take care of the baby. And don't be afraid, okay? Hurry, hurry. I got 'em right here. -Okay, all right. -Help her. -This one's on me, okay? -Thank you, God bless you. -Thank you so much. -Thank you. -Take care of the baby, okay? -Yeah. The fate of the United States and the entire world is in the hands of Dr. Beatrix Cera. She has been working day and night... to bring back the bees, the plants, and the animals. Without you, Doctor... mankind, as we know it, and all plant life will disappear. How can you stand here and enjoy your view? Millions of people in the world are starving. There is no more food left. Beatrix, the world is dying. But with your bees, when they're ready... it's going to change everything. It can reverse the universe, and we can finally prove that-- What? That there is no God? Can you prove there is one? Alba, Alba is your proof. [CHUCKLES] Bea, if Alba was saved by God... then why did God let those millions of girls in those dying rooms die? What God? You can change the world, and you will. I will make that bee. [LAUGHING] [INAUDIBLE CHATTER] WOMAN: Excuse me, Doctor. I brought you some breakfast. Thank you, Mikilah. Leave it on the table, please. You should eat, you know. There are so many people out there just starving. You're right. Yeah. Thank you. Mr. Serghey, I know where we can find a Christmas tree. Ha, ha. Alba. All the trees are dead. But he has one. I saw one in that horrible temple. Don't play with him, Alba. We cannot go in there. [LAUGHING] Yes, we can. I know how to get in. Alba, don't, stop! We need to ask your mother. Look, you forgot my neck hurts. Alba, Alba. Oh, my God. Alba, Alba. Alba. Alba. Help! Help! Help me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What happened? What happened? Alba, can you hear me? Yes, Mommy. I'm all right. Beatrix, take a look at this. Were you aware of this? No. No, no, this is not right. This is a mistake. It explains the heartbeat. Beatrix. There must be a cure. There's always a cure. This is rarest form of auto-immune disease. And it's so aggressive And with our means today, it's, it's irreversible. There is no such thing as irreversible. We cured cancer, for God's sake! Bea, I just heard. I need John Zachary. I need John! He will know what to do. But Bea... I'm serious, if you don't bring him here, I will destroy all my work. I have nothing more to give. But so much to take. You must have faith. And then eternal life will be given to you. Man, this guy ain't gonna fill my belly. I'm outta here. I know everything, my friend. You see, when you have no more money to give away... We're hungry. This wretched world will turn its back on you. We are at the end of times. We must change. We must join our hearts through love. Is love gonna feed us? Just love? Do you actually want to feed them love? You really think you can save them? The whole country? The whole world? Why are you here? I need you to come with me. Alba is dying. Beatrix asked for you. Mom, is Pastor John coming? Oh, I don't know, sweetie. Go back to sleep. I have to go to the lab. Mom, you still think you can create that bee? I do. I have to! To save the world. I'll pray to God you succeed. [SIGHS] [♪♪♪♪♪] Thank you. Thank you for coming. Have faith, Beatrix. Alba will be okay. You are the only one that can help her. Let's go. Prayed so much that you would come. Of course I came, you're my best friend. Mr. John... did you see that there's no more snow in the world and all the water is gone from acid rain? How'd you know that? Mom, I saw it in my dreams. I travel a lot, you know, Mr. John. I know, Alba. I know. Sweetie, you should rest now. I will take Mr. John outside, all right? Yes, Mom. Now that he's here, we're all saved. Help her, please. I... just help her. I'd give anything for her. Except you already have, haven't you? BEATRIX: When I see this... I forget for a moment that the world out there is ending. Then I start dreaming, for a few seconds only... and then I remember Alba's disease, my work, my un-resurrected bees. I just keep wondering... what will happen with ourselves, our own selves, deep within us? Me, you, Alba? What will happen with our souls? Will we fly? Go to another planet? Scout the universe forever? Or be just that... nothing. What do you believe? I don't believe. I wish I had your faith. Alba's faith. I wish I believed with all my heart in something bigger, greater, kinder. [HELICOPTER FLYING] The international food crisis has depleted every nation's food supply. This could be the end. I need to run some tests, myself. But is she gonna be all right? John? Is she going to be okay? Beatrix, have faith. But, I need an answer. Tell me, is she going to be okay? She's going to be okay. Beatrix, look at this DNA sequence. It's not right. It's a mutation of the heart tissue which is... No, no. This must be an error! The machine is broken. We'll get a new one. I wish all these tests were wrong. Yeah. I wish I could help this little girl. Somehow. Poor Beatrix. She has been through so much. Nobody understands her life. Nobody really understands her. They all think that she that she's this "Bee Lady" that will "Save the World". She's just a little soul... that needs to be loved. Beatrix, you should really get some rest. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm bothering you, I know. It's just that I cannot do anything. I can't even focus on my work. Mom, you never actually explained to me why is that only the bees can save us. Oh, you never really wanted to know. I'd like an entomology lesson. -Really? -Sure. Me, too. Ms. Warren, I am sure. -Really? -Yes, please. Well, the bees can sustain the whole life circuit. We, we couldn't do it with humans or mammals for that matter, because you cannot make a human clone. Cause it's not moral? No, no, because see you can make a clone, but not a million. But with the bees... Beatrix, you should be focusing now. That bee can save Alba's life, if our expert here can't. You should go to the lab. The new queen emerged. They're waiting for you. The last queen bee in the world. She could save us all. Careful. We'll wait now. Our god is a bee. Did you do this? Do what, John? Please, Father heal this child with your power. Please. It's now or never. She must accept them as mating partners. In nature, the drones die in 13 minutes. But not today. Minute 14 means we have succeeded. And, when the eggs are laid... we can say we have created immortality. [MACHINE BEEPING] Okay. Okay, just hold right there. We need to get Beatrix. Oh, God, Oh, God, I hope they make it. They will. Have faith. In God or the bees? Beatrix. Give me one second. Bea, it's Alba. Come now! -Alba, try to breathe. -Alba, Alba, my baby! Alba. Love you, Mommy. I love you my baby. I love you. Mr. John, you'll take care of Mommy? Always. Alba, Alba, Alba, Alba! John, do something! Clear. [CRYING] -Clear! -There's still nothing. Alba, wake up! Wake up! Oh, my God! Beatrix, Beatrix. No. Beatrix, stop it! Beatrix. [CRYING] [FLATLINING BEEP] [CRYING] Child, go be with God, our Father. Jesus in Heaven, Now and forever. Please, Father, take her into your arms. Please, Father, take her into your arms. Go. [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Serghey gave Alba an icon. with Mary, mother of Christ. Good for healing, he said. I never cared to touch it or look at it, but Alba brought it to my lab. "Mommy, to help your bees. I promise." I never thought she would be the one who needed help. I know it's coming. The acid rains have started around the globe. Soon there will be no more oxygen left. The ones who weren't lucky to be dead by now, will suffocate. My death will be painful and non-heroic. I was the "Hope of the World." What a charade! [LAUGHING] You were right. I've been so angry with God... [SIGHS] ...for everything. I killed a man once. He was impatient for Alba to die, so he could throw her away and go home for the day. He wouldn't let me take her. I stabbed him with my pocket knife. I felt nothing. And I took her and I ran away. Your God probably despises me. He forgives us for our sins. But see, I don't think it was a sin. I'd do it again. And again, and again. John... do you still believe in Him? I do, Beatrix. Yes. Then make him wake her up. I want her back. He can do that, right? He can do anything. But sometimes this is His will. What use is your Jesus, if He can't help us when we need Him? Beatrix, she's with Him right now. She's in a much happier place. No, no. She was happy with me, with me. I'm her mother. I want her back. I know. I know. [♪♪♪♪♪] Dr. Cera, they came out. You made it. You made the immortal bees! The bees. Yes, they woke up. Come quickly. Oh, but I can't leave Alba alone. He took them to his temple. You mother loves you very much, Alba. And I love you, too. You are my chosen ones! You signed a pact. I bought you all. You are my strength. You will never change. You lie. You cheat. You steal. You kill your babies, before birth and after birth. And you hate. You hate. You hate with all your hearts! You hate your God. And every other Godly man out there. [LAUGHS EVILLY] You killed your stupid Jesus. And then in His name you cry. Your species deserves to die. But I won't let it. I will transform you. I will make you invincible. And I will make you... immortal! Immortal! Immortal! I gave you my soul. for Alba's life! I gave her one, didn't I? But you took it back. I didn't. Your God did. You promised us immortality! [CRYING] I did everything you asked. I gave Him up. I believed in you. Do you want Alba back? I can get you Alba back. But I want you to ask me for one thing. -John's head. -No. No, no. Ask it, Beatrix. I told you, you couldn't save Alba. He left you all alone. In your pain And in your sorrow. Do you see it now? Christ can do anything, Beatrix. You just have to believe it, with all your heart. Even if I had to die for Him, I won't deny him. No, no. No! John. [ALL COUGHING] [CHUCKLING] You're the Devil! I'll destroy you! [CRYING] [COUGHING] God forgive us. Forgive our sins. Forgive me, Lord. I give my life to you, Christ. I believe in you. [COUGHING] [GASPING] Light of the World. No, no, no, no! I won! Please don't come back. Don't come back. I won! I am the root and the offspring of David and the bright Morning Star. My reward is with Me, to give every man according as his work has been. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end... the first and the last. [WHIMPERING] Go and feed your child. Your faith has brought her back to you. Mommy. Alba, Alba. [LAUGHING] Alba. I love you. I love you. I love you, Mommy. I love you. Thank you. [♪♪♪♪♪] [THUNDER RUMBLING] Mom... He sent me to take care of you.
