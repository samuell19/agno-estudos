Judge! You obey the sultan So you obey me now You know the law, Judge My friend! My friend! Judge! Lead troops to invade Shirabad.

Judge! Take him away! Tell them the Judge You're just a child When your father comes to work here But you become our most trusted soldier As a man, I know you are loyal and fair But now you have to choose Tasks are not always honors, our biggest challenge is Is talking against our enemy But to find agreement with what we are most looking for Jafar doesn't deserve your honor Also your sacrifice I hope only the glory of the kingdom of Agraba You see a party for yourself And you can win behind my person These people, they will follow where you lead, but it's up to you Will you stay silent while Jafar destroys our beloved kingdom Or you will do what is right And stand with the people of Agraba My daughter I'm sorry My friend Judge Guard!
