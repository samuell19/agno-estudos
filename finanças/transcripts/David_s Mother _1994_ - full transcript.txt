[UPBEAT MUSIC] [GRUNTS AND CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLING] [GRUNTING] Why? One of the kids stuck some stuff. [GRUNTING] We are now approaching the cookie section. Would anybody like to select some cookies? [GRUNTING] "...chemically separated chicken. "Modified wheat flour. "Twice as sodium erythorbate. "Sodium nitrate." Tempting. No, thanks. Let's find something to eat. Xanthan gum. Sorbic acid, sodium benzoate, calca... David, this is not for you. This will give you brain damage. Stop staring, you're not so pretty yourself. Hi, David. [CHUCKLES] [DAVID GRUNTING] SALLY: Hold the door. Hold it. Oh, yeah. All right, get the door open and let me in. SALLY: Yes! Home sweet home. Take off the shoes, turn on the TV. And yes, ladies and gentleman, it is another scintillating afternoon at the Goodson home. All right. For our matinee today we are pleased to present The Wizard of Oz. "Yes, isn't that the movie you've only seen like 30,000 times?" Yes, but, it is starring Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr and Jack Haley. Approximate screening time, one hour forty-one minutes. Copyright Loew's Incorporated. Enjoy. What do you want for lunch, sweetie? Huh? All right, here are your choices. I have, I have... Lasagna? And I have cabbage rolls. Lasagna, cabbage? Cabbage, lasagna? Cab... cab... Which one do you want? May I suggest the cabbage roll, because tonight we are having spaghetti and meat balls. Which do you want? Come on. Cabbage rolls! Good choice, honey. This is living. Hmm. [GRUNTING] Mrs. Goodson? Somebody here for you. Mrs. Goodson? SALLY:Yeah. This is Gladys Johnson of The Department of Child Welfare. Who did you say you were looking for? Mrs. Goodson? Mrs. Sally Goodson. Mrs. Goodson isn't in, this is the maid. Mrs. Goodson, it is urgent that we speak. I said this is the maid and I got to go clean or I'm gonna get fired. The wolves are nipping at your heels, honey bunch. Don't worry. I won't let them get their hands on you. Hi, Sid. Is my sister home? I don't know. She just said she was the maid. Oh! Delusions of grandeur, huh? David, use the spoon. [GRUNTS] David, use the spoon. [SIGHS] I'm not playing Miracle Worker here, David. Use the spoon. [LAUGHING] Use the spoon, David. Love of my life, use the spoon. Hello! David! Use the spoon. [KNOCK AT DOOR] BEA: Open up. I know you're in there. Oh, great! David, Aunty Bea has come to call. What a treat! [INCREASES TV VOLUME] Sorry, I didn't hear the bell. Yeah, right. I would think that you would welcome someone to talk to. I have someone to talk to. David and I were just discussing cutlery. So I heard. So did everyone else on the floor. [KISSES] Everyone except David. Okay. Sit down. I wanna talk to you. Who's dead? Abraham Lincoln. Sit down All right, you are drinking wine in the afternoon now. It's leftover from the Academy Awards. I had a party. I bet that's the last time you cleaned this place. Oh, why doesn't that surprise me? Go home. Eat off your floor. What are you doing here anyway? I was at the dentist. And I thought I come by in person, and make you promise me something. What? I shudder to ask. Promise me that you'll have lunch with me on Sunday. [TSKS] You and who else? He's very charming. I'm sure. And he's on his 40's. Don't fix me up anymore. Recently widowed, has no children. [SIGHS] Sounds really hot. Look. Look. Just do me a favor. He's lonely. Oh, so now what are you doing? Setting up the 100 neediest cases? I told him all about you and David. He'd love to meet you. Uh-uh. I can't do it. I'm busy on Sunday. Doing what? Dancing Swan Lake, that's what. Sally, just do it. I mean, you owe me this. Can he come? No, he cannot come. This is for adults only, except for you. God, you turning into a recluse, you know that? Thank you very much. [SIGHS] Okay, honey, your cousin Justine is gonna come over on Sunday and spend the day with you. You like that? Now, why don't you just eat it with a spoon, right there. [SCREAMS] Ah! What did I do? Only the right hand can put food in the mouth. Don't you know anything? Why? I don't know, it's a little secret between David and God. All right, I'll see you on Sunday. And if you please, wear something that doesn't have dried food all over it. Yes, go. Give me time to scrape a dress. Walk me to the elevator. [SCOFFS] Like you're six-years-old and you can't get there yourself. [SCOFFS] You need a babysitter. I got a letter from Susan. Susan who? Susan, your daughter Susan. She's pregnant. [SIGHS] What? [SCOFFS] She's only 18. She's 19. Already? Did she happen to mention whether or not she's married? She's getting married in a few weeks. I like that. First things first. Why don't you call her? Nah. I call her, she'll probably miscarry. [SIGHS] We haven't been so close and she chose to move 3,000 miles away from me. You should go to the wedding. I don't have the wardrobe. Well, buy the wardrobe. Yeah. Freelance editors make that kind of money. I'll give you the money. No, you will not give me the money. It would be my pleasure. It was your pleasure to buy us a VCR. You know, I don't like you that much to make you that happy. [ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS] But don't worry about those hemorrhoids, they'll go away. The itching will stop. [SIGHS] [DOOR CLOSES] [GRUNTING] David. Did you hear that? Your sister's pregnant. And getting married. In 19. [GASPS] I think you and I are a little bit out of touch, buddy. [GROANING] Don't be upset that you weren't invited to the wedding. She didn't invite me either. But maybe that's better. You know that person's gonna show up. [SNORTS] Remember him? He used to be your father. But, you know what? It wouldn't have killed her to invite us. I used to be her mother. SUSAN: I don't wanna talk about it. PHILIP: Come on, Susan, you were fine. Everybody forgets lines. Daddy, will you stop? Will you forget the damn play! Susan, watch your mouth. What happened? PHILIP: She's upset. She forgot a few lines in the play. SALLY: Honey, Shakespeare, who knew? I bet everybody thought it was supposed to be that way. How would you know? You weren't there. Sweetheart, the babysitter canceled at the last minute. What was I supposed to do? [SCOFFS] Get a different babysitter. Sweetheart, David doesn't like strangers. Oh! Oh! Oh! For once he could have adjusted. Wouldn't have killed him. Well, it didn't kill her either. You know, if you weren't in here sulking, you could come out here and have some terrific brownies. Sweetie... this is Junior high school, the critics weren't there. Neither were you. You can be a real beast sometimes, you know that? Yeah? I hate you, too. You don't hate me, I'm your mother. You may resent me, and you may be filled with ambivalence, offended, and indignant as hell, but trust me, daughters don't hate their mothers. Except in my case, that's different. Why not we just... cut the crap and you give me a big old kiss. Huh? [LAUGHING] [SIGHS] So what if we weren't invited to the wedding. [TSKS] To hell with it. I've got an idea. Why don't you come in my room with me and help me pick out a dress for my blind date? Please, God, he'll be blind. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, here's one. This is good. How is this? What? What? Don't give me that look. You think I look like a prison matron in this, don't you? [SCOFFS] You're right. I do. You're always right. Oh, now here's one. This. It's a little acrylic creation. Sally Goodson, equally at home yachting the afternoon away, or in the frozen produce department of her neighborhood A&P. Honey? All right. Tomorrow you and I will go out shopping and buy me a new dress. [HORN TOOTING] Mrs. Goodson? Yes. I am Gladys Johnson from The Department of Child Welfare. Please don't make me file a report on you. Can we go somewhere and talk? If I buy you a cup of coffee, is that considered a bribe? I'll buy you one. Got an expense account up to a dollar. Let's go, David. I sent you two letters. Damn, that post office. Slipped the last one under your door. Yeah, it's probably still there with the rest of the debris. In it I explained the department is taking a new census of handicapped children in the Tri-state area. Now, when computers in Connecticut were put online, a discrepancy was noticed. Yeah? What? New York has David assigned to a facility in Connecticut, but Connecticut never heard of him. Well, that is a discrepancy, isn't it? You jerking me around, lady? I'm trying. It's a state law. Every handicap child who can benefit from a program must be in one. Is he in one or not? It's not a difficult question, Mrs. Goodson. If he's in a program just say, otherwise I'll have to report it. Why? Because if I don't, I could lose my job. And I can't afford to lose my job. Be straight with me, okay? All right, go ahead. What do you wanna know? The last information we have is from the Reynold school. That's his last placement? Yeah. Then where did the authorities get the idea that David was going to a program in Connecticut? From me, I told them we were moving. Why? To protect him. From what? The bastards at the Reynold school. There are other programs. We have been there. Programs, and schools and rehab centers, and all they did was terrify David. My son is damaged. He's not gonna wake up in a couple of days and go, "Oh, now I feel great, send me off to college." This is as good as it gets. But this only get this good at home. Within those four walls, badly needed paint, that's where he's safe, that's where he's happy, and that's where you can leave him. There are so many different kinds of programs. Oh, man. You know, I'm talking to a wall. Come on, David, let's go. Sally, sit down. David, move it. Hey, come on. But, come... [SIGHS] GLADYS: Sally? Sally, I'm trying to help you. Well, put in your report you didn't find me. I can't do that. You can't do that. Of course not. You and the whole medical establishment think they ate the Last Supper. [TIRES SCREECH] [HORN BLOWING] What? Stupid, son of a bitch. You like your work, Gladys? Not always. Mostly I like the paycheck that almost supports my two kids now that their father took off. You, too? Me, too. You think they can smell this planet from the next galaxy? If they got noses. So, what you gonna do? [SIGHS] Come back another day. You weren't home. But David is going into a program. The sooner you get used to that, the sooner you both will be happy. Hey, Gladys. Thanks for the coffee. [MELANCHOLY PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hi, there, champ. It's me, momma. Come here. Come here. What are you doing over here, stuck at the corner? Shh. What are you doing? Let me see you. [GRUNTING] Ooh! Mmm! Mrs. Goodson, you'll have to wait outside. SALLY: In a pig's eye. I beg your pardon? He has peed himself. [MUMBLING] He's sitting over here in the corner in his own urine and nobody even noticed. Mrs. Goodson, I think you're making too much of this. It happens. It doesn't happen in my house. In my house he doesn't pee himself. [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] So, Dave, you think they'll let me in the restaurant wearing this thing? I hope so. Um, I can't believe I'm going on a date at my age. This is so stupid. David. David. You be my date, okay? You sit here like we're in the restaurant, okay? All right, you're my date. [HUMMING] So... whatever your name is. Um, I must admit that I expected a much older man. [CHUCKLES] Do you like that? [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] Get this. So, then I'll say, um... "What is it you said you did for a living?" [GRUNTS] "You manufacture toilet seats? "Oh, my God, that is so interesting." [LAUGHS] [LAUGHING] Come on, David, it's okay. We're having a good time here. Come on, sweetie, kids tell jokes all the time. You know this joke... you know this joke? "Why did the moron tiptoe pass the medical cabinet?" Because he didn't want to wake up the sleeping pills. Oh, come on, sweetie, tell me a joke. Mmm, David. Out of all the kids in the whole world, you ought to know a few moron jokes. Tell me a joke, David. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] Come on, sweetie. Tell me a joke. [LAUGHTER] At ease, soldier. John, this is my sister Sally Goodson. Sally, this is John Nils. Hello. Hi. How are you? Hi. You want a drink? Yes. I'll get the waiter. Is that what you did to you hair? I couldn't decide between dreadlocks and cornrows. Shut up. Oh, you know that wallpaper store across from Bloomingdale's? John owns it. Yeah? Wow. Excuse me, waiter. Come here. Can I have a Bloody Mary? Double. And stick around. Yes, ma'am. Isn't it a beautiful day? Oh, it must be 75 degrees out there. You know, I just love it when there's that little... Christmas, you know, there's that little nip in the air, but... Ah, still... She always wanted to be a weather girl, but our mother wouldn't allow it. Shut up. Those two. [CHUCKLES] Be right back. What's the matter with you? What? Will you stop pretending you're a mute! I talked. A nod and a grunt is not what I consider talking. Now, when he gets back here, I wanna see some charm, some sparkle, some vivacity. Hire a clown. I already got one. Just relax. [BLOWS] Make up your mind. You want a relaxed mute, or frenzied debutant? [SIGHS DEEPLY] Is something going on? No. Yes! Yes. She is mad at me because... I am so uptight that I won't do my Oprah Winfrey imitation. [JOHN LAUGHS] I haven't been in a social situation with a man... other than my dentist, for I don't... What? Since The War of The Roses? I'm out of practice. But you're very funny. [SALLY CHUCKLES] [BLOWS] This guy's a piece of cake. You are the easiest audience I've ever had. [LAUGHING] That's because you're so funny. Justine? The Governor called, your apartment came through. They're not here. [SIGHS] This is it. It's very nice. Mm-hmm. Have you had your tetanus shots? [CHUCKLES] No, this, this place is for living, it's not for showing off. That's right. We're definitely downwardly mobile. Can I get you a drink? I have some cheap gin and some flat tonic. How can I resist? So, you live in the same building as Bea, huh? I live in the penthouse upstairs. Oh, the penthouse. Whoo-whoo-whoo. It's just a little balcony really, but I can see the new store from there. I... Did I mention that I opened another store? Oh, maybe a couple of times. [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] Well... business is good. Oh, are you applying for something? [CHUCKLES] JUSTINE: Aunt Sally? We're back. Ah. Come meet the family. [GLASS CLINKS] We went to the zoo. Hi, John. How was lunch? None of your business. John, I want you to meet my son. This is David. The one you've heard so much about. Come on, David, be polite, shake hands. [GROANS] John is speechless. He didn't think you were so handsome, probably. I'm sorry. Oh, no, no, no. Don't sweat it. You know, most people don't expect David to be so handsome. How about Pinocchio , honey? Haven't seen that a couple of days. Ow. Don't bite. He loves Pinocchio, up to the part where the boys turn into donkeys. And then that is just a little too close to home, you know what I mean? Now where were we? I remember, we were talking about your new store. Say, you know what? David and I should swing by someday and say, "Hi." Oh, don't worry. He can only eat so much wallpaper. Sure, anytime. How about tomorrow? Sure, give me a call. Okay, I will. Listen, can you do me a favor? Could you drop Justine off at her house, because I have a manuscript that I just got to finish tonight. Justine? [DAVID GROANING] I found you a ride. Oh, sure. See you, kiddo. I'll give you a call. Yeah, you do that. [DOOR CLOSES] [SCOFFS] What is it with people? Why can't they see how beautiful you are? SALLY: Phil? PHILIP:What? Come in here and look at our beautiful son. I'm in bed. Who would know to look at him that he is not just like any other five-year-old boy? Always getting into stuff, answering back. He throws the same tantrums in the checkout line when he doesn't get gum. I'm reading. I don't want you to read. I want you to talk to me. David has your mothers nose. The only good quality in your family and David has it. Hmm. You have your father's nose. Thanks. But you have other body parts that make up for it. I'm not in the mood for sex, Sally. So, who's asking? When we talk about my body parts, that's where the conversation's going. Is that such a bad place for it to go? Just not in the mood. [SCOFFS] When do you think you might be in the mood? You wanna make an appointment? Well, I guess so. Maybe, that way I'll have something to look forward to. Phil, where have you been lately? Where have I been? Right here. Try to look in at someone besides your son once in a while. My son? Wow, I guess that says it all, doesn't it? That's not what I meant. I do the best I can. Prove it. What do you mean? How am I supposed to do that? Leave the kids with Bea for a weekend, let's get out of here. You know that I cannot leave David. Well... That says it all, doesn't it? Getting it somewhere else? No, I'm not getting it somewhere else. I'm not getting it. And you know what? I don't miss it. You know what I miss? I miss coming home and arguing about politics, and how much money you spend. I miss new recipes and watching my daughter get giddy over nothing. I miss laughter. That's what I miss, not sex. I'm sorry. Sure, you're always sorry. Well, I'm sorry because I always do something to be sorry for. Ask Bea, I was a rotten kid. Now, I'm a rotten grownup. I love you. I even love your nose. [LAUGHS] Someday... Someday... Someday what? Someday nothing. You love me too much to ever leave me. You are here for the duration. JOHN: You look nice. Yeah? Well, this is it. This is... my wardrobe. 'Cause if you ask me out again, you gonna have to take me to someplace I can go naked. [SIGHS] Surprised you asked me out this time. Why? Because you got a load of David. Look, if my candor approaches rudeness, you're gonna have to forgive me. I don't like it when people freak out over my kid. Yeah. Well, you know, maybe this was not such a hot idea. Oh, please stay. It wasn't David. Yeah, right. All right. I wasn't really prepared for him, I guess. He did stop me in my tracks. But it was... It was something you did. It... What? You made fun of him. Well, at least I thought you did. But, then... I spoke to Bea and she said that sometimes when you sound like you're being cruel, you're really just making jokes to cover up how uptight you feel. It doesn't mean anything. So, you discuss my so called sense of humor with my sister behind my back? Don't get mad. You are one presumptuous wallpaper hanger. I don't hang it, I sell it. Except for you, I'd give it to you. Hand painted. Silk screened. Flocked. Am I tempting you? You're nauseating me. Excuse me. Are you ready to order? What's the most expensive thing you got on the menu? Suffer, you. [SNORING] SALLY: Ah, please. Eh. Garbage, garbage, garbage. [SNICKERS] Hey, babe. You wanna hear some crap? Listen to this. "Montgomery left Greystone as he had entered it. "Penniless. "Save for his silken waistcoats and golden fobs. "Upstairs Melanie lay prostrate on her bed, "weeping scalding tears for her profligate lover." [CLICKS TONGUE] I know how you feel, honey. Take it from somebody who's been there. It gets easier. PHILIP: I left you some money in the top drawer. SALLY: Do you need your hair dryer? This is a separation, you're not supposed to help me pack. Sorry, I don't know the etiquette of divorce. Not a divorce, this is a separation. I want you to tell me the truth, because if you don't, you won't come back. It's easier to stay away than to come back to a lie. What do you want to know? I want to know about the woman you're going to. The one who is waiting for you. [ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS] MAN: Hey. Who is she? [ALARM BUZZING] Just a girl at the office. She's nothing. Then why are you going to her? MAN: Open the door. Because I don't know where else to go. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] What's going on there? You got a problem? Open up. You could stay here. I can't. Why? I can't do it anymore. Do what? I can't face one more father at the playground. I can't watch the look on his face... when he looks at David, and then his own boy. I, I can't bear the relief on his face. The pain in the eyes of the women when David falls down and hurts himself. I just can't bear it. And you think I can? Yeah. Yeah, I think you can. I think you can do anything. Taxi. [SIGHS] Wait a minute, hold up. Before you turn me into some kind of saint here, and I lose you for good, I want you to know something. There's not one day that goes by that I don't blame David for what isn't his fault. Not one day that I don't... I don't wake up and ask myself, "What the hell did I do to deserve this?" But I feed him, and I clean him, and sometimes I hate him. I have this fantasy that one day David is just gonna wake up healed, and he's gonna tell me that he knew all along everything that I did for him. He's gonna tell me that he knows every time that I wiped his ass, and sat with him watching some stupid movie. [CRYING] That's the worst part. Because I need him to thank me. He can't thank me. [SNIFFLES] But I do what I have to do. And I want you to know that if you come back, that you're coming back as somebody who knows how hard it is to do what you have to do. And who understands that some times you, you just have to get away and rest. So, I want you to go away and rest. And when you're rested... [SNIFFLES] I want you to make up your mind. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] I love you. Of course you do. [SNIFFLES] [SIGHS] [TV PLAYING SOFTLY] [DAVID GROANING] [KIDS CHATTING] [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING] SALLY: Look. Look, David. Look. [DAVID GRUNTING] Look at the carousels. See the horses? [DAVID AND SALLY LAUGHING] MAN: [WHISTLES] Come on. Oh, David. Whoa. Whoa. Are there seat belts on this thing? Yeah, for sure. I... Hang on to him very, very tightly, because he doesn't have balance. Don't you worry. I'm not worried. David, listen to me. Listen to mommy. Hold on to the horsie. Hold on tight. I'll be right there with him, I'll hold him. Now, come on. [LAUGHS] Hold his arm. Hold his arm. Hold his hand. Like this horse, David? MAN: There you go. [LAUGHING] Here. Come on let's get up on here. That's it. You have to put him on there. He can't just... He doesn't get, get on. Up! I got him. [GRUNTING] Okay, seat belt. [LAUGHING] David? David. Hold on to the pole, David. Hold onto the pole. Put your hand on there for your mother. [LAUGHING] Okay. Here we go. Hold on tight, David. [LAUGHING] Great. Careful with this pole now. [YELPS EXCITEDLY] There's your mother. [DAVID LAUGHING] Hi, David. Hi, David. [LAUGHING] David. JOHN: You worry too much about him. SALLY: I get scared. He wasn't scared. This once he wasn't scared. Maybe you're the one who gets scared. Oh, boy, you are just determined to get me mad, aren't you? Man. I'm sorry. It was two minutes and already you're an expert. God bless men, they're so smart. Sorry. It wasn't called for. Maybe it was called for. Yeah, it was. But let me apologize anyway. I'm working on becoming a nicer person. You're nice enough. [GRUNTING] Where have you been? A mental home? You are a, what's the word, volatile. [SCOFFS] It's exciting. All right. Listen, I got a pot roast on at home. If the apartment isn't burnt down. You like pot roast? I can't today. Okay. I'm supposed to be at the store now. We're doing inventory. You don't need to make excuses. We got to get home anyway. Thanks for a great afternoon. I'll call you. Sure. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Bye, David. David says bye. No, you're not. Yes, I am. I said no! Well, I said yes. Brenda, do you want to lose your phone privileges? Mom, I am going! Yes, yes, yes. Come in, now! Mom, I am going whether you like it or not. You're gonna be sorry, young lady. Mom! Brenda! SALLY: Susan? SUSAN:What? SALLY: Put the clothes back. No. SALLY: Put the clothes back. You're not going anywhere. Why? "Why"? Look, this is your mother you're talking to. I am not a moron. I know what kind of girl Sandra is, and you are not spending the night over at her house without her parents. Nothing's gonna happen to me. You're right. Because you're not going. Ma, that's so unfair. Uh, and what am I supposed to do here? I don't know. Why don't you do what you always do? Watch you take care of David? It's all you ever do. Do we have to do this again? David cannot take care of himself and you can take care of yourself. Then let me take care of myself. Let me go. Look, do we have to have this fight? I don't want to have one. Come on, I'll owe you one. You can be a pain in the ass tomorrow, but today, would you just please lighten up a little bit? You know where I really wanna go. No, where would you really wanna go? I wanna go live with daddy. Go ahead, who's stopping you? Sam would let me move in. [SCOFFS] Yeah, well, you know what? I don't really give a damn what your father's wife would do. I mean, what kind of a woman has a man's name anyway? Sam? That sounds like somebody on a sitcom. You will make it a sitcom. A new wife, the daughter comes to live with them, they all laugh, and they learn something new every half hour. So you will let me go? [SCOFFS] And get a little peace and quiet around here? I would be a fool if not to. All right then, fine. I'll call right now. No, you will not. Yes, I will. No, you will not. Give me the phone. I will. No. You said I could go. Stop it! You want me... [GRUNTS] Let go of the phone! What's your problem? [PHONE RINGING] All right. All right. Hold your horses. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Hello? GLADYS: Sally? It's Gladys Johnson. You have some good news. Yeah, what? We located a facility in 11th Avenue. It's one of the best in the city. They only take a limited number of kids, but I got you an interview. Oh, hello, excuse me a sec. You told me that you're gonna give me some time. I have. What are you talking about? I just saw you. Sally, just go to the place and check it out. I don't wanna pull rank with you. Just be there, 11 o'clock. [DOOR OPENS] MALE TEACHER: Okay, kids, stay together. Watch yourself on the steps. FEMALE TEACHER: It's good, everybody. Stay together, single line now. MALE TEACHER: Lisa, can you take Billy's hand? Thank you. Good girl. FEMALE TEACHER: Get back in, you know. Come on now. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey, Marky, check it out. [LAUGHING] Hey, what's the matter with you, lady? [MEN LAUGHING] BEA: I heard about the school down the village, it's supposed to be good. SALLY: Ugh! Here we go again. I'm not putting David in a home, Bea. It's not a home, it's a school for special children. But, to be eligible you have to live in the district. So? So, David's father moved into the district. Good. Let him go to the school. You're impossible. How much is this? $100 an ounce. Oh! She'll take a pound. Philip said he would pick up David on Tuesday afternoon to keep him over night. That way, you could have some time off. Just forget it! Excuse me. You're denying yourself to punish Phil. [SCOFFS] He walked out on his kid. David is as much his fault as he is mine. I'm not gonna let him ease his conscience just cause he takes him for pizza once a week. Fault? David is nobody's fault. Yeah, right. David is nobody's fault. Well, he isn't. God, that is so nice. Wouldn't it be wonderful if life was so nice? No fault. No fault accidents, no fault divorce. No fault movers. Can I help you? Where is the ladies' room? God! Why are you attacking me? Because it's bull. God! They don't have a clue what caused David to be born with scrambled eggs for brains, but you know it wasn't my fault. I wish I knew that. I wish I knew that [STAMMERS] it was something, it was the fluoride in the water or the, uh, the asbestos in the ceiling, or the lead in the paint. I wish I knew that it wasn't the joint that I smoked when I was carrying him. Or that wine that I was so sure that it wasn't gonna hurt him. Or that I had some screw up in my genetics and my chromosomes. Stop it! You're gonna drive yourself crazy thinking things like that. I stopped. Give me one of those. No. You quit. You're making me crazy, just give one over. [SCOFFS] "Give one over"! [SNIFFS] This is good. We're back in high school, smoking in the bathroom. Why didn't you show up at the school this morning? They were expecting you. I did show up. I just didn't go in. Why? Because I didn't like what I saw, okay? What? I didn't like the way they herd the kids. My son is a human being, he's not a sheep. Sally... I hated it. GLADYS: Sally, it's the best place in the country for David. You should get down on your hands and knees and pray they take him. He'll have his own room, he'll learn how to dress himself, how to prepare food. What do you mean he'll have his own room? What? You mean, he'd sleep there? Yes. Then when would he come home? On weekends. Oh, God... You gotta give me some more time. Again? Yes, again. [STAMMERS] Just a couple of weeks. What's a couple of weeks? Come on, you could go harass somebody else for a change. Well, thanks for that. Look, will you have a heart here? Don't be mad at me. You know, you're not talking my kid for a walk around the park. You are taking him away from me. Two weeks. That's it. [ELEVATOR APPROACHING] [JOHN LAUGHING] Uh, more wine? Thanks. I don't have any. [LAUGHS] Then why did you ask? To be polite. You want me to go get you some? You know I can, it no problem, really. We got all night liquor store just around the corner. Between a crack house and a welfare hotel. I could just put on some pearls and strut down there and get you some. You talked me out of it. [DAVID GROANING] What? [GRUNTING] [SCOFFS] It's a movie. The movie's over, big deal! The movie's over, it's not the end of the world. Come on, sweetie, let's turn in. [GROANS] Come on. [GRUNTS] David, come on. Come on, let's get you to bed, sweetie, come on. [GRUNTS] Stop it! Would you mind if he stayed up? Of course, not. Right. No intro, no sound, and no more tantrums. Why don't you teach him to do it himself. That way he won't have to bother you. Yeah, I'm gonna do that tomorrow, right after I teach him how to operate the computer. It's not that hard. Look, David. David, look, this is the side... that goes into the machine. See? It just slides right in. Excuse me, Mr. Wizard? It took me a month to learn to run that thing. What do you expect from him? Patience, Rome wasn't built in a day. Here. First we have to... [GRUNTS] David, first we have to push the button with the arrow. See? JOHN: David. [SCOFFS] God, he does not understand what you want him to do! Press the button with the arrow, David. [GROANS] Come on. Press the button, David. [DAVID SCREAMS] Just turn the damn movie for him. [SCREAMING] SALLY: Just turn the movie on! God! Come on, David, sit down. Calm down, get up here. Settle doe... David, settle down. You're fine. You're fine. Why do people think if they just talk loud to him, he's gonna be normal? He's not. You can wake him up in the middle of the night and he's still gonna be like this. He's not kidding around. JOHN: I know. I'm sorry. Still, I think I could teach him, I'd like to try. Will you just take it easy with him, though? Got to... So, what do you want for dessert? I have frozen pound cake, or microwave brownies. Neither, I better get going. So soon? Yeah, I was up at crack of dawn. Oh. Were you, were you doing inventory again? [CHUCKLES] No, you better hit the road. There. Sorry. Oh, don't be. No. No, I'm... Well, I never was one to wait to be asked. [CHUCKLES] I guess you don't find me attractive in that way. Oh... No sweat. I don't find myself attractive in that way either. It's not that. Then what? Ah... [SIGHS] Are you gay? [SCOFFS] You're gay. I... No, that's cool. No, you know, I know a lot of gay guys and sometimes gay guys come out late in life and that's cool. I'm not gay. [SCOFFS] I'm... [SIGHS] I'm married and... What? No, I thought your wife died. She did. About a year ago, but... She's still my wife, I've... Well, that didn't die. I... I feel like I'm cheating on her. Oh. [STAMMERS] Is that why you ran out of here so fast... Yeah. ...after every date? Can you understand that? Can I understand that? Honey, I can top that. You know my husband, he thinks he has a new wife. The government thinks he's married to another woman, but I know the truth, he's still my husband. I think the only difference is that I've had more time to get used to the idea of cheating than you have. Get out of here, or I'll hit on you again and that'll really embarrass you. I'll call you. So, David, did you hear? You mother has not lost her allure after all. [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] SUSAN: I won't lose it, I promise. Just be careful with it, it was grandma's. You didn't like grandma. [SIGHS] Yeah, well, I liked her diamond. SALLY: Oh, is this the Goodson wedding? Yes. Oh, this must be David and Susan. Come in, darlings. I'll be back to pick them up later. David, be good. Susan, watch after him. Oh, won't you come in? One glass of champagne? No. No, thanks. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] We're here. Whoo! [LAUGHS] Go. David, destroy your aunts apartment. [LAUGHING] We're gonna do just fine, who needs you? So, you spending the night at John's tonight? I hope so. Slut. [CHUCKLES] Good luck. I'll need it. Come on, he's a man, you're a woman. I don't think he noticed. [SIGHS] He noticed. What? Nothing. [GIGGLES] You are beautiful, you know that? [CHUCKLES] Yeah, right. I mean it. Mm-hmm. I'm also blonde, 5'2', very slim hipped. When are you gonna let me wallpaper your apartment? [LAUGHS] Oh, my God. I mean it. [LAUGHS] It would make my furniture look shabby. So, I'll buy you some new furniture. [LAUGHS] You don't owe me anything. You got laid, I didn't give you a kidney. I do, I owe you a lot. You're like the sun shining its light at me. [CHUCKLES] Oh, God. John, do yourself a favor, play a little bit hard to get. Wow. We did it in Versailles. My wife's hobby was interior decorating. You hate it? [CHUCKLES] How about Bea's apartment? Ugh. Why? Because you've both been architecturally digested. Give me a place where the pigs can roam free. I take it back, I like it. Oh, look at this place. Wow. [GRUNTS] Man. Man... Uh! You got yourself a regular restaurant here. You cook? No. Oh, God. When you're rich, the birds sing. Look at this. It's nice. Nice fridge. Beer? That's good. That means you remember your roots. You want one? No, thanks. Watch this. Souvenir of my mis-spent youth. Mmm. Mmm. [CHUCKLES] This woman is cute, very cute. JOHN: I had ice cream at home. I didn't want ice cream, I wanted yogurt. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] Nice. [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] JOHN: Okay. Why don't you try it again. [GRUNTING] See? This is the side that goes into the machine, one with the wiggly edge, okay? So, you put it in. [MOTOR BUZZING] Now, see the button with the arrow? Okay. Yeah. Well, he's in there right now teaching David to be a brain surgeon. JOHN: This is the side... Yes. That is so nice, Bea. It is also a waste of time. Okay. You just put it in. Now... [CHUCKLES] See the button with the arrow? That's the play. Press it, David. Sally? Come here. Just a sec. I have to go. My gentleman caller is calling. I'm always nice, Bea. That's my fatal flaw. Uh... Hello? Excuse me. Was somebody asking you for your advice? Goodbye. Yes. What do we have? JOHN: We've got something to show you. [DAVID GRUNTS] JOHN: Patience. First you got to show your mother how smart you are. Okay. Okay, do your stuff. Uh-huh. Yeah. See? He knows how to put the tape in. That's terrific. Now, remember the arrow? Press the button with the arrow. Press it, David. No, no. That's rewind. [GROANING] The one with the arrow. See the button with the arrow. [GROANING] Okay, okay. Okay. That's enough for one evening. So? Do I deserve a kiss? You call that a kiss? I call it the only kind of kiss I'd give in front of my kid. You can't be too... I just... All right. Hold on a second. There. Go. [GIGGLES] Mmm, I created a monster. You didn't create him, you just woke him up. You know, put him back to sleep, will you, because David's just right in there. Please? Later. [SIGHS] Okay. Second suggestion. Bea said that your daughter's getting married in California. Uh-hmm. So, how about I fly out there after the wedding, we grab up the coast? Uh, that's good, but I'm not going to the wedding. Why not? Well, among other things, I wasn't invited. But, you know what? Even if I was invited, I wouldn't go. How come? Because we've beat up on each other enough. I think that it is just let things lie. Better than what? Better than the way it used to be. Look, you're gonna have a hard time believing this, but I don't have a winning phone personality. [LAUGHING] I mean to. I mean I call up and I mean to say, "I, I really miss you," and it comes out, "Why the hell don't you ever call me?" And, you know... That doesn't make you a particularly desirable personality. So, anyway, my daughter ends up with a chip on her shoulder the size of the Rock of Gibraltar and me too, and... and... Anyway, I just decided that... That I would just keep my mouth shut. And that I would keep reminding myself that I wasn't that close with my mother and my daughter is not that close with me and... [SIGHS] In the end when we were all raised and alienated our kids and we turn to dust, that it won't really matter in the least. [DAVID SCREAMING] Okay. Uh... I'll go. [DAVID GRUNTING] [PLANE ENGINE REVVING] ANNOUNCER: Flight 628, non-stop service to Chicago is now ready for boarding in Gate 17. This is as far as I go. Call when you get to your father's house. Okay. Okay. Oh! I got you the sun block and want you to use it, because everybody in California has got skin cancer. I saw it on Oprah. Promise me you'll use it. I promise. Don't let your father buy you a new car. Everybody in California drives like a lunatic. Will you stop worrying? So, who's worried? Everything is fine. You're leaving because you hate my guts. Which you're supposed to hate my guts because you're 16. That way you'll grow up mature and independent. Solid, you see. I don't hate you. I know, I just said it. I feel like the continent's tilted here, they keep sliding to California. Just think we'll be happier if I live with dad for a little while. You have enough to do, you don't need me around to fight with. Which translates into, I don't spend enough time with you because I'm too busy with David. ANNOUNCER: Flight 728 from... Let's not do this again, okay? Okay, fine. ANNOUNCER: All passengers should now be on board. I've got to go. So, go. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] You're breaking my heart, kid. I've got an idea. Yeah, what? The week of the wedding, let's go down to Key West. For what? It's called a vacation. You know, sunburn? And have drinks with umbrellas in them, and sandy beach... It sounds really good, but I can't. Why not? I just can't. Everybody deserves a vacation, even you. I'll call Bea, maybe she can take David. No, look, Mr. Take Charge. I said I can't because I can't. Why? David and I are moving in a few days. Moving? Where? To Fort Lee, New Jersey. Why? I don't know. I have my reasons. Why didn't you tell me? I'm telling you. No, you're not. You're mentioning it in passing, like I'm not worth confiding in. Well, what did you want? A hand engraved change of address? Let me call Tiffany's. Don't do that. What? Now what am I doing? Don't mock me. I'm not mocking you. Come on, John, you know my mouth. There's someone listening to what comes out of your mouth. Don't use it as a weapon. [SCOFFS] You put out a couple of times, they think they own you. I can't tell you. I couldn't tell you because I'm breaking the law. What? If, if I stay here, they're gonna take David away from me. And you kept that to yourself? It's not your problem. Of course it's my problem. John, you know what? You're a really nice guy. You laugh at my jokes, and we have a good time in bed together, but, this is my problem, alone. I've been doing it for 16 years, I'm real good at it. In other words, butt out. Have a heart. I'm fighting for my kid's life here. I don't have time to tip-toe around and wonder if I'm hurting somebody's feeling. Why not? I fought for my wife's life, I had time. That's different. I'm his mother. Why is that different? Do you think you love your son more than I love my wife? No I don't. I think I am the one that takes care of him and you know how he is. I know how you let him be. What? Uh, never mind. I'm going to take a walk around the block. Where is my jacket? Where you left it, on my bed. Great! Go. That'll solve everything, won't it? Just go. Just let me take a walk, huh? I'll regret anything I say now, and so will you, I promise you. SALLY: So what is that, a threat? No, it's an observation, based on a 100 fights and a thousand regrets. Don't go. It's better if I do. I don't want to say anything to hurt you. Do you have something to say? Go ahead and say it. Go ahead. Come on, haven't you heard, I have thick skin. It was very hard for me to put my wife in one part of my heart so I could let you into another. I don't think you'll ever do that with David. Well, there's one big difference here, David is not dead. No matter what some people wish. What, are you crazy? I don't wish him dead, I'm his father. I love him. Yeah. From afar. That is love. What you do, breathing in air as it comes out of his lungs, it's lunacy. It's not good for him. I think I know a little better than you what's good for David. Do you? What the hell is that supposed to mean? It means, I have to beg you to let me help your son. You should thank me. Working a VCR is not gonna change his life. Nothing is gonna change his life. You won't let it! You're so sure you know what he can do and what he can't do, you won't let him do anything. What do you want from me? I want a wife. I don't want to be alone. I don't want David to be alone. How can he be alone? You wear him like a second skin. I am fighting for my kid's life here. I don't have time for all these other feelings. That's the second time you've said that. You're not fighting for his life, you're fighting to control his life. You use him, don't you see that? I have sacrificed everything for him. You have sacrificed everyone for him. You said you wanted to leave. So, leave. [FOOTSTEPS FADING] "As taut as a pulled trigger, the shattering climax will leave you gasping for more." Yeah, right. There we go. "The joyous escape of two Siamese cats, and a bull dog "turn a provincial mining town upside down. A mirthful. G-rated movie. 110 minutes." What do you say, David, you ready for a little mirth? David? [GUN FIRING] [DAVID LAUGHING] [HORN TOOTING] [DAVID LAUGHING] NARRATOR: The old Union Jack still waves triumphantly over the land. [LAUGHING] MAN: Still stands the... [INDISTINCT CHATTER FROM TV] MAN: Cutting across main street on the left to the railroad tracks. Beyond the railroad tracks is Polish town. [INDISTINCT CHATTER FROM TV CONTINUES] [LAUGHING] [CHANGES TAPE] Oh! Hi, Sid. Is my sister in? Uh, she's in there. She's in there? Right. [DAVID LAUGHING] What are you doing in here? SALLY: Just waiting for the rain to stop. I've been trying to reach you for over two days. So has John. The next time you to go into hiding would you please switch on the answering machine? What's the matter with you? You look like hell. I spend my time sleeping a lot lately. What's the matter? You two have a fight? Big deal, couples fight. Oh, honey. Bea. What? What? Will you tell me something? Am I a bad person? What do you mean? You're the best. No, come on, just give me the truth, okay. [SIGHS] All right. What happened? David can work the VCR. What? In a million years, would you ever have believed that David could work a VCR? I guess not. [SCOFFS] I had that damn machine in the house for three years and he never touched it. Two weeks with John and he's an expert. Do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to use it? How are we discussing how smart David is or how dumb you are? [DAVID GRUNTING] John said that I don't let him do anything. I think he's right. I mean, if he can work a VCR... I mean, who knows what else he can do, what he can be. What he can be? Honey, David is what he can be. He's impaired. That's just a word. Am I the one who said what it meant? I mean, did I make him like this? Stop that. You're not that important. God made him this way. Well, Bea, maybe there's two gods. The one that cooked his brains, the one that made sure they stayed that way. What do you think you did that was so terrible? You had an afflicted child. You took care of him. That's all. Nobody could have been a more devoted mother. Yeah, well... [SCOFFS] I mean, Susan would agree with that. Do you think she thinks she had a devoted mother? And how about Phil? You did the best you could. That's all anybody can do. How good was my best? David, come on, honey, you want... You want to go upstairs? Let's go up, come on, stand up. [GRUNTS] I'm gonna zap something for lunch. Weren't you radio active? Please. SALLY: Good. That'll leave more for us. [GRUNTING] Just this once don't be hard on yourself. You know, doesn't make you that important just because your punishment's always the worst. Now, don't worry, John will fix everything. Yeah? And how is he gonna do that? Well, when you two are... When we two what? You know... You... Ugh, Bea, don't dye your shoes yet. Now, what does that mean? It means I don't know if I'm interested. Of course you're interested, you like him. Yeah, but what if I don't love him? Love him? Who expected you to love him? Didn't you? Of course not. I was hoping for companionship. Sally, he's a very rich man. He can take you out of this crummy life. You can get someone to take care of David. You can... Vacations in Europe. You can walk the aisle of Bloomingdales like a normal person. Did you hear what you just said? I don't care what I just said. There's nothing he wouldn't give you. Well, then why marry him? Why don't I just forge his name on a check? Why don't you just stop making jokes and ruining your life? Uh, I don't believe what I'm hearing here. Did you love Stephen when you married him? Oh, love? That's absolutely irrelevant. I was 24-years-old, I was entitled to be in love. And I'm not? Well, when did that happen, Bea? When David was born? When David turned out the way he turned out, did that make me [STAMMERS] unworthy of love? That's not what I'm saying. God! What are you saying, then? No matter what harm I've done anyone else, I've done more to myself. I'm not gonna settle. I wouldn't degrade myself any further than I already have. I won't settle. I'm not asking you to settle. Yes, you are. Of course you are. I'm asking you to save yourself. No you're not! You're demanding it. Why? Because I'm exhausted from worrying about you. I haven't got the energy to do it anymore. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] Well, then don't do it anymore. Don't do it. I never asked you to. I never wanted you to. Tell me something. Why is it that the people who don't screw up their lives always feel guilty about people who do? I don't know. Hug me. [SNIFFLES] I resent you. I know that. I got the gifts to prove it. Sometimes I hate you. And I love you. Ours is not a simple relationship. Well, who says simple is good? [SNIFFS] You know all the parts I meant and the parts I didn't. [DOOR CLOSES] It's back ordered. Four, maybe five weeks. What can I say, I sell it, I don't manufacture it. Uh, excuse me, sir. The wallpaper you sold us has peeled off the walls and is lying in my dining room floor. What are you doing here? She's kidding. I'm not kidding. Please come in the back before you wreck my business. Excuse me. Come on, honey. I am not kidding. Oh, here they are. Put this in you hand. come on. Come on. [GRUNTING] David. I want you to sit down here, okay? Here. Sit. Play solitaire, okay? [GRUNTS] Stay there and don't move. JOHN: I'm surprised to see you. Oh... [SIGHS] We just left Bea running amok in Bloomingdale. [GRUNTING] I'm glad you're here, gives me a chance to apologize. For what? Everything you said was true. I should thank you. You can thank me tonight. I can't. Tomorrow night? You're such a nice man. You really helped my kid. You really helped me and I owe you. JOHN: You can pay for dinner. I owe you too much to keep seeing you. That I don't understand. Sure you do. You don't have to... love me to keep on seeing me, you know? [CHUCKLES] Yeah, I do. You're that kind of guy. Besides, before you know it, the mistake, the relief of being with anybody with real feelings for me. Then I will hurt you. You might learn to feel something for me. Miracles happen. I already feel a lot for you. Enough to know I won't feel more. You don't know that. I do. I have so much to do, just please go. Go find somebody who's normal. Go find, go find some woman who thinks you're as funny as you think I am. She's out there. And you'll find her. Now that you're not cheating on your wife anymore. Okay. You go do what you have to do. But if you need me, call me. No promises necessary. No promises given. [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] David. We got to go, let's let this man sell wallpaper. [GRUNTING] Goodbye, kiddo. Goodbye, David. David says bye. SALLY: Okay. Roll them. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six. North Carolina Avenue, you want to buy it? You want to buy it? It's going out for auction. [MUMBLING] Sold to me for one dollar. That was a good property, David, you should have bought it. All right, now, your turn. No, it's my turn. It's my turn. All right, um... Come on, little lowly, come on co-co-mo. Come on, little... Yeah. Fitner. I own it already. I hate that. Here, David, your turn. Come on, sweetie. Roll the dice. Roll the dice. Come on, baby, Come on. Roll the six. Roll the six, David. Roll the six. Land on Park Place. Come on, I got a hotel in Park Place. Roll the six. David, roll the six. Let me help you. Roll it. Roll it. Yeah! Six! One, two, three, four, five, six. Yeah! I'm hot. I'm hot. Where's the hotel? I had a hotel in six. Give me my hotel, David. Stop eating my hotel. All right. [SIGHS] [GRUNTING] David, you didn't roll a six. [GRUNTING] Honey. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] I cheated. Boy, you got to know when people cheat you, David. I may not always be here to tell you that. Got to be able to stick up for yourself. [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] CHILD: Come on, man, hurry up. WOMAN: Can I help you? Yes, we're looking for Gladys Johnson. I'm sorry, I don't know who that is. Department of Child Welfare. I see. Come have a seat. Your name? Sally Goodson. Your son's name? David. Sit down. [GRUNTS] Nice place, huh, David? Homie. [TAPPING FEET] Fill these out, please. All of them? Yes, please. I'll take this. Miss. I don't have a pen. [GRUNTING] [DOOR OPENS] I'm sorry. We were here at 9:00. Just like you told us. Well, my son woke up with a 102. I called... They didn't say a thing. Come on, David. I am so sorry. I asked if we could have some time here before David joins his group. So what do you think, David? Isn't it nice? [SIGHS] So, David... Oh, don't you look handsome today. Come, let's hang this jacket up. Come here, come on. [GRUNTING] David, don't do that. David, honey, that's not allowed. Please. [CRYING] All right. It's all right. It's all right, David. You can keep it on if you like. It's all right, honey. It's fine, keep it on if you like. I just want to show you around. Come on, let's go this way. [GRUNTING] SALLY: David. Cut it out. [SCREAMING] SALLY: David. David! Knock it off. Come on, sweetie, calm down. Calm down. Come on, sweetie. It's okay, sweetheart. [YELLING AND SCREAMING] GLADYS: What is it? Because he been in places like this. I told you that. Stop it. Stop it, David, stop it! [GRUNTING] Don't you bite me! Leave us just few minutes alone, will you? Please! [DAVID CRYING] Can you give us just a little time to get around... Ow! David! Get out! Look. Look! David, stop it, okay? Stop it, David, listen to me. Look at me. Look at me! Look at me! Look here. Who is this? Who is this, huh? [CRYING] It's me. It's mama. [SIGHS] Honey. We got to talk here, okay? I'm gonna talk and, David honey, you're gonna do the best you can o listen to everything I say. All right? Please, come on, baby. Okay? David, I want you to stay here with Gladys. I know I promised that you wouldn't have to, but I was wrong. Things stink. They have for a long time. I'm just getting a whiff of the stench. Sweetheart, it's not your fault, it's my fault. Listen to me, David. My whole life I never felt special, I never felt it. Pretty enough or talented enough to be anything but ordinary. And then you came along. And you were the way you were, David. You know what? I was the only one who could handle you. Do you have any idea how special that makes a person feel, David? Oh, honey, you're a piece of work, just like me. But I could get you up. And I could get you dressed, I could feed you, and I could make you real happy. And that's the way I kept you. But not for you, honey. I did it for me. I kept us watching movies... and I stayed special. And you stayed calm. [SIGHS] Sweetie, you know what? There's a lot more out there than calm. There's a whole world out there, sweetie. Even for you. Even for you. [SIGHS] And you know what? Hey, you can work a VCR. [SNIFFLES] I want you to stay here with Gladys. I wanna see if you got any other tricks up your sleeve. You can stay, but listen, the truth is this. I may not be special, but, oh boy, [CLICK OF TONGUE] you sure as hell are. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [SNIFFLES] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR SHUTS] [UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
