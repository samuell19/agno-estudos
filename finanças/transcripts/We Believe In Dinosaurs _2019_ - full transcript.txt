People that visit the Ark Park, they have to pay sales tax, and Answers in Genesis, they get back up to, like, $1.8 million per year of the tax money they normally would send to the state coffers, so instead of the state getting the money, Answers in Genesis gets to keep a good portion of their sales tax. I got on the Answers in Genesis website, and I got on there, and I looked at the employment thing, and lo and behold, there was one for a CAD, a computer-assisted design operator, specifically for the Ark Park, and basically what I found was, they required the salvation history, the agreement with Answers in Genesis statement of faith, all these different things that even included what church you went to and things like that. ♪ ♪ I've never seen a job, not even for janitor, that didn't require the belief statement. ♪ ♪ If you're getting any sort of public funding and, all at once, you only hire certain people based on their religious beliefs, that contradicts the idea that you're actually helping the economy.

I readily agreed to do so because they thought it was important to represent the fact that there are religious people, deeply religious people, who are also uncomfortable with those sorts of government benefits going to a religious purpose. I think implicit in the idea of the separation of church and state is humility, that no one religion, no one philosophy has all the answers. And they are very confident in what they believe, and they have strong reservations about me. I'm confident in what I believe too.

It was a big deal. This is-- I was street preaching in Huntington Beach in California, did some street preaching. I've got some money-shaped gospel tracts there, and I'm explaining the effects of sin on the world and the importance of Genesis and the importance of the Ten Commandments and everything that goes along with that. ♪ ♪ I don't know, there might be a degree to which I think back to where I was and think, "What would have changed my mind?" I--some of this stuff is new, so I don't know my way around at this point anymore. Hey, where are the charter member plaques? Are they further on or... - They should be right down here. - Right down here? Okay. I was certain that I knew everything. I was really, really, really prideful in my knowledge of Creationism and how I knew more than the scientific community and I knew more than all of these people who are just accepting evolution without asking questions. I regret that I was a big-- you know, a big know-it-all. ♪ ♪ Oh, it's a different-- this is a different person. This is someone else.

Yeah, he's just having a good time. So it's a very--very fun diorama to work on, lot of dynamism. All these figures, we started with a 3-D scan of actual people, and then from there, we take it into the computer, do a lot of resculpting, but it's really fun stuff. - We're working out, really, the face of Noah. He's the iconic character, so he's probably the most important character that we have. And then, of course, you got Ham, Shem, and Japheth and then all of their wives. Noah has to be a very iconic figure because we're not only gonna use him in pictures like this illustration; we're gonna use him in static figures and animatronic figures, and also we will re-create him in film as well. - These are some of the different face concepts for the wives of the sons, so just kind of pulling some different features from people from all over the world so that they show that it's a compilation of different characteristics, so... Obviously we get to kind of invent that 'cause we don't know what they looked like. We get from the Bible that Ham's descendants went to the Americas through Asia, Africa, and so we kind of have a bit of a challenge to kind of put all those kinds of features into the faces of Ham's wife and Ham. - Here, you know, you have Ham's wife. You know, we do-- do research; we've-- Some physical features here. - And so based upon the characteristics, then we find some gave you Asian.

They have the right to build their park, but we also have the right to protest it, that this story is not scientifically accurate. And not only is it not scientifically accurate. It's immoral. The original idea was to put up a billboard-- a regular billboard for 30 days, and if we raised enough money, we'd put up a couple. This was just the shot to let people know we had-- If you gave us $500, you can actually take a photo of yourself. We want you all wet, whatever pose, take several poses, and we will actually put you in the billboard drowning in the ocean. So it got us a lot of press. We raised almost $10,000 in a couple days. The problem was, the billboard company backed out when it got all this press. We didn't expect radio, TV, papers would pick it up. - Atheist group's anti-Ark Encounter billboard is rejected. Two billboard companies have refused to display an advertisement by an atheist group to protest the Ark Encounter amusement park in Kentucky. Tri-State Freethinker, the president, Jim Helton, welcome to "The Bill Cunningham Show." - Thanks for having me on. - Now, why do you say genocide and incest somehow is part of the ark? - I don't know how else to describe it. In the story of Noah's ark, God drowns everybody. Now, some Christians will say that people are wicked, but he drowns everybody, even the innocent: women, children, bunny rabbits, everybody. That is textbook genocide. I see no other way to describe it. And then he repopulates the Earth through incest for the second time. We find this highly immoral. - What do you mean, incest? - If you only have one family, the only way to repopulate is having sex within that family. - They could've had some other family on top of the mountains somewhere. - Noah's family and his kids, that was it. And keep in mind, Adam and Eve was through incest, too, to populate the Earth for the first time, so this is the second story of incest. And if you go to Ken Ham's Creation Museum, he says, "Incest is okay because God said so." - Well, if God says okay, it's okay. - No! Killing people and incest is not okay. - Well, what are you gonna do about this? You have two companies, Event Advertising and Lamar, that said, "Nah, bubba, nah." What do you do now? - We went-- a mobile billboard company reached out to us and said, "We'll put it up," but then recently, with all the press it's gotten, he backed out for fear of his personal safety. He did not feel safe driving it around. So we have $10,000, and we cannot find a company in the state of Kentucky or Cincinnati willing to take our money. - Have you confronted Ken Ham on this? - Ken Ham has-- we have had a back-and-forth through Twitter. He has personally called me out a half-dozen times on Twitter this morning alone. He has blogged about us several times. So the reason we call this out is, it doesn't stop here. It seeps into our politics. It seeps into our lawmaking, and that's why we make a stand. - Well, you're a heathen that's gonna burn in hell, and if that's the case, I will say a prayer to get you out. If you're lucky, you'll end up in purgatory, in which case, I can help you. If you're in hell, you're beyond my reach. - Then I'll be in good company. - There'll be a lot of-- other hell characters will be down there, and you'll be burning, and there'll be a million serpents biting your legs for eternity. - See, again, you're threatening me with torture, which proves my claim that that's immoral. Just because I require facts and evidence should not be a reason to torture me forever. - Well, you're gonna burn in hell. - I'm okay with that. - All right. What's your website, if any? Well, look, stay in touch. - All right. I will. - God bless you, man. - Thanks for having me on, Bill. [laughs] Bye. [upbeat music] How'd I do? - I'd like to go protest a protest. On July 7th, a group of atheists are planning on protesting the opening of Ken Ham's Ark Encounter attraction. I actually looked... Ken Ham was getting ready to be done with the ark, and he texted me and said, "Hey, I just learned some atheists "are gonna be protesting the opening of the Ark Encounter." I texted him back and said, "Man, I would love "to be there for that. I would have a great time." So here's the deal. I would love for you to help me get a team of people that I've assembled to the Ark Encounter so that we can protest the protest. At the end of the day, what's fun about it is, these are people that right now, if my worldview is true, they're on their way to hell. I get the privilege, I get the joy-- I'd say more than fun; it's joy-- of trying to go into these storms and rescue people and say, "Listen, you need the truth." By the way, don't tell the atheists that we're coming. My name is Eric Hovind. I get the privilege of traveling around and talking about creation versus evolution and really... We're seeing a resurgence of the Creation Movement, people realizing science doesn't fit the evolution worldview. "Let's go back and rethink this." And so we're seeing the Creation Movement as a whole raise back up. The evolution worldview says somewhere between 13 billion and 20 billion years ago, there was a big bang. The idea that the universe came into existence... [snaps fingers] Instantaneously is exactly what we get out of Genesis 1:1. So the Bible tells us that it's our authority, and science is gonna confirm that, so I'd like to try to prove to you... So you have this idea of a lot of people believed evolution. Some people use that as an argument. "Well, evolution must be true." But majority doesn't determine right and wrong, you know? Jean-Luc Picard can tell you a lot about the Starship "Enterprise." That doesn't make it true. I know people that can teach me a lot about evolution, and it doesn't make it true. The longest wavelength we see is red. Well, if God stretched out the heavens as a curtain, we would expect to see the longer of the wavelengths of light, which is the red of the light, and everywhere we look, guess what we're seeing. The red shift in starlight. The fact that our vice president is somebody who believes in creation, I think that leads just even more credibility to the number of people out there that go, "I don't believe this because I'm ignorant. "I've thought this through. "I've looked at the information. I've concluded this is the truth." And so yeah, I'm excited that we've got lots of elected officials that hold to this worldview. - Do you believe in evolution, sir? - Do I believe in evolution? I embrace the view that God created the heavens and the Earth and the seas and all that's in them, and-- - Right, but do you believe in evolution as the way he did it? - The means, Chris, that he used to do that, I can't say. - But you don't believe that-- you don't take a fundamentalist view of the seven days of creation, do you? - [laughs] Chris. - I'm just asking. Do you? - Chris, where are we going with this? Is it-- - The idea that if even one part of the Bible is not true that the whole thing crumbles is a very difficult piece of terrain to defend, and it seems obvious to me that science, at multiple levels, clearly has proven the Earth is more than 6,000 years old, and why some folks, in the name of their religion, I assume, choose to ignore that and to cling to a religious viewpoint that says otherwise is not something I fully understand. - I never heard anyone say that Genesis can be inspired, can be from God and not be history, that God can give us something that's something other than history. That was just not an idea that was ever presented to me. - I believe the Bible is true in what it says in Genesis, principally communicating the idea that God created this world, and I believe this. I believe that God has a purpose and a will for this creation. That having been said, science informs how I understand what that creation is and how this planet functions, and there have been hundreds and thousands of years of project-- of progress in human thought since that time that help us to better understand the world that God has made, and I welcome that aid in understanding God's world. - It's like there's a little voice in your head that closes the door whenever you see evidence that doesn't fit your beliefs and then opens it whenever you see evidence that you can make fit, and that's something that, you know, every creationist had, a little guy in their head saying, "Wait, nope, stop. Don't listen. Don't look at that," and, "Wait, we can accept this." ♪ ♪ I was also debating anyone who would pay attention to me whenever I got the chance.

This is one of our most popular books, "Dinosaurs of Eden" from Ken Ham, and so books like this that walk through with really good artwork, and this has got some up-to-date scientific information in it to help the kids understand all about dinosaurs and things.

Well, this is the creationist version of that. - The growth had to take over a period of time. - The audience is being snowed. I mean, it looks like science, and unfortunately it isn't.
