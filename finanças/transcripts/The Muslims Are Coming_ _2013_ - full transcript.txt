[silence] [rhythmic beeping] [TV changing channel then static] [various new clips, etc.] There is this, well, virus if you will. A virus that is far more toxic than swine flu. And we are failing to recognize it as such. They are not totally dedicated to this country. Many of them are trying to force Shari'ah law on the people of this country. By the way, the last three dozen terrorists to attack, um, Americans on airplanes have looked amazingly identical. They have identical skin color, eye color, hair color. Half of them were named Muhammad. Did you know that the turkey you're going to enjoy on Thanksgiving Day this Thursday is probably halal. Halal means it's been ritually sacrificed according to the Koran. Make no mistake about it. Islam is a violent religion. These are young, angry terrorists who wanna kill you, and they wanna kill me. And you know it. Stop with the P.C. crap! Every...single... Butterball turkey... sold in the United States of America... has been scarified to Allah. There are places here in America where people are saying, "We need to have Shari'ah law." It's the mosque. The mosque down here on 9/11. That's inappropriate. Let me repeat that: Every...single...solitary... Butterball turkey... in the United States of America has been sacrificed to Allah. We are dealing with a culture that is in its Medieval Era. Unless the bomb is inserted under the foreskin... And by the way, I don't see a clear angle on the anus. Why don't we tell 'em to go back to the Middle East where they came from? Is there a Muslim problem? Look what's happening. Muslims killed us on 9/11! Terrorists. Shari'ah. Muslim. - Muslim. - Muslim. - Muslim. - Muslim. - Anus. Butterball turkeys. [Motown-esque soul music plays *] * Oh, Muslims, you know they are a-coming. * * They're gentle and they're friendly. * * So open up your arms and give 'em a hug. * * Muslims, you know they are so chummy. * * They're super-cute and fluffy. * * A lot like your Shar Pei. * Hey, that's a cute dog! * American ladies, you really shouldn't wait. * * A Muslim man can really do wonders on a date. * * American brothers, you really can't go wrong. * * Muslim chicks are super-hot. The loving's oh, so strong. * * Muslims. How about those Muslims? * * Oh, Muslims... [song fades out *] [ acoustic guitar strumming and handclaps *] [announcer]: Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Negin Farsad! [applause] Hey guys! How's everybody doing? I'm an Iranian-American Muslim female. Where my Muzzies at?! Come on, guys! Where are my Muzzies at?! Sweet! I thought for sure Islamophobia would die down since we were so many years out of 9/11. But then with the election of Barack Obama, this thing stared happening where everyone was accusing him of being a Muslim. Is Barack Obama a Muslim? It was alarming to me that being a Muslim became an accusation. The President's problem is that he was born a Muslim. To me, the most shocking thing, honestly, was the opposition to the Ground Zero mosque. I never saw a rally in America against a religion before. Thousands of people with horrific signs saying demonizing comments about Muslims, simply because of their faith. To me, it was a wake-up call that something was wrong. And we just felt like, "We have to do something." We're going on a tour. We're going to Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi... I'm not kidding. And northern Florida next-- In two weeks! It's called "The Muslims are Coming!" It's a one-way trip and-- [laughter and applause] And in the absence of any real skills, we kind of figured stand-up was the only real... activist option. We don't have any security. Uh... There might even be some fasting. It's Ramadan. Who knows? It's gonna be crazy, guys! The goal of the tour is to go out to middle America using comedy, reaching out to people beyond our community. And give America this big, Muslim hug, you know? Like, "Come on, America. Bring it in. Yeah. Ah, yeah that feels good. Ah, yeah." We wanted to go to places like Georgie, Alabama, Mississippi, Arizona, Utah... You know, places where they don't normally see Muslims. We should probably put together a list of comedians that would, like, that would be good for this kind of tour. I mean, we need... comics who are gonna be funny for everyone, not just for Muslim audiences. And sexually attractive. All right, that kinda-- Down to two. - [laughs] [kids together]: The comedians! Kobe Bryant's gonna miss the remainder of the season. Unfortunately, he rolled his ankle on a Muslim prayer rug. [laughter] You wouldn't wanna go to, like, [imitating Arabic language] ...Majeed's Cupcakes. [laughter] My mom looks like Julia Roberts, my dad looks like Saddam Hussein. [laughter] "As-salam alaykum." That basically means in Arabic, you know... "Get out." [laughter] I'm just gonna be racist, because it's fun. [laughter] My girlfriend's Palestinian. She's from the Middle East. I got her on eBay. [laughter] One of the few benefits of being an Iranian-American Muslim female is that I can fly around on a little rug, granting people wishes. [laughter] We raised money from our friends and our families to make these shows free. If you were, like, on the fence about Muslims, but broke, like, we didn't want you to have any excuse not to come. [upbeat pop music *] Laughter can sometimes be a catharsis about things that are very painful. I think that's in some ways, what I've used it for. In some ways, that's its genesis. Comedy has a huge role to play. Not only for social critique, but for also saying things... that the mainstream media will not say. It certainly can change society for the better. I mean, Voltaire's influence, you know, is huge. I mean, you can go throughout history... Lenny Bruce, although he wasn't that funny, was very important. And, you know, of course, Lisa Lampanelli... changing things for the better. I don't know, standup just has that thing where, if you're laughing... then, you know, it does get through to you more. I mean, any dummy can enjoy a nice standup show. [laughing] One of the things about religion is generally, people think you can't joke about it. And by the way, Islam has a big problem with this. A particular problem with being seen as over serious. Not being able to take any amount of critique. And you're comedians. You're spreading knowledge and peace through "laughtors." [rock music playing *] So we arrive in Columbus, Georgia, and most tours have a tour van. Um, but we couldn't afford that. So we rented a car. [tires screeching] But there were too many of us, so we ended up renting two cars. [tires screech and whip cracks] We had to promote the show, so we figured, "Let's go hand out flyers." So we thought, "Where can we find people hanging out on a Saturday in Columbus, Georgia?" [music ends abruptly *] I mean, I've never even touched a gun. Is that weird? I've never touched a gun. Never? Well today, we'll go in... I think we should have a picture of us holding guns. And that's our new picture, "The Muslims are Coming!" And we're all holding an AK-47. My parents immigrated here just in time for the Iran hostage crisis. It, it was sometimes hard for me growing up. I was only one of like, two Persian kids in school. It didn't help that I was... unnaturally hairy as a young lady. You wanna be invited to a free comedy show at 8 o'clock? It's called "The Muslims are Coming!" There's a bunch of Muslims onstage, but they're hilarious. You have any Muslims in there buying guns, do you know? Oh yeah, all the time. I have a lot of Muslim customers. Yeah? Folks think everybody that wants to have guns are a bunch of rednecks and are trying to... whatever, you know. [stammering]: It's not like that. I live in a rural area. You're libel to see... snakes come in your yard, black bear... You're not gonna take your broom and shoo them away. Right. So you shoot snakes? You're gonna take a .45 and you're gonna shoot 'em until he's dead, to keep him from eating you. Please come on out. It's gonna be a lot of fun. We'll have a good time together. We'll definitely take this. Please, yeah! Take it into consideration, the "coming to the show part." I hope you had a good gun show. We're in Columbus, Georgia, at the Hookahmeup lounge. It's a little crickets and tumbleweed. I mean, look at how many people are out. I think this is really gonna fill up. I mean, we'll just pull people off the streets. It's also, I'm just gonna add... hot as balls inside the venue. Hot as balls. I live in New York. It's, it's the 10th anniversary of 9/11. It's also the 10th anniversary of me being Arab. 'Cause I used to be white! I was white before 9/11! But now, it's funny. After 9/11, people would say things to me about being Arab. Not all bad. Sometimes just curious. They say, like, "Oh, you're Arab. Wow, I love hummus." [laughter] "That's a very nice thing. I like that." I used to have people go, "Oh, you're Arab, but you look so normal." That was kind of weird. [laughter] I had someone say to me, I swear to you this is true, I was on Fox News Radio. National show with Brian Kilmeade. And in the middle of the interview, I don't know why, he goes, "So, you're Arab and your family's Muslim. Tell us, how many terrorists are there? That's what he asked me. I said, "83." I just threw a number out there. I'm like, "83?" [laughter] I actually had to go to Iran, ah, not too long ago, because my cousin was getting married. And even though we were the same age, it was so weird for me to go hang out with her because I didn't know if I should, like, censor myself around her. You know what I mean? If I should hide all the freedoms I enjoy like boys, and alcohol, and peaceable assembly, you know? [laughter] I felt like if she knew the truth about me she would consider me some kind of Iranian-American slut-whore-hooker-prostitute. You know? Which in New York, we just call a "Facebook friend," so... [laughter] The Columbus show... sucked. It was like, hot and uncomfortable... We had a teeny crowd in a long bar. Half the people, I'm not even sure if they knew it was a comedy show. I think it was "comedy by ambush" for these people. Personally... whenever it's a night of "fill in the blank" comedy, I stay miles away, I don't-- An evening of women's comedy or Jews or whatever the thing is. Fat people or gay people. That sounds terrible to me. When you look at show business, the roster is layered with, uh... peoples who have utilized their minority status and mined it for good humor. And that is, believe me, we're not gonna give that bill up easily. We just, we just barely just let the gays in recently. The fact that the Muslims are coming in now... Things are getting a little crowded in the green room, if you know what I'm talking about. You gotta show us people hate you. [kids together]: Most hated groups! The four most hated groups in the United States are... uh... Muslims... Obviously Jews, gays, blacks... Muslims, then Jews. Muslims would probably be one of the biggest. Muslims. - Muslims. Boy bands. I don't know what it would be beyond that. Illegal aliens. People of Hispanic background. Indians, Mexicans... Vegans. Could be Mormons. Mormons are pretty hated. - Black people. - And then Asians. Black of course. I might be able to put black people above Asians. Asians aren't that hated. Gays are still in the running. Gays. Homosexuals. Any homo looking for a husband or a wife. Oh yeah, gays, yes, gays. Absolutely, yeah. Gay Muslim, wow. Double-fuck. And Jews. Jews. Jews. - Hipsters. Wall Street. Straight white males and Muslims. One and two. Hippies, which don't even exist anymore. Congress. - Atheists. Fat people who chew tobacco. The most hated group, I guess, uh... I know what you're implying, it should be Canadians, but unfortunately... the rest of the world doesn't agree with me yet. Muslims probably are the top. Number one definitely is Muslims. Definitely. The Muslims are way up there. Muslims, for sure. I'd say boy bands... and then Muslims. [bell ringing] No Snapple, once again. This is such...bull, my friend. Dean needs to find Snapple everywhere. [ding] Like the man can't function-- Like his blood runs Snapple. How can you have all this stuff and not have Snapple? Is it-- kill you just to have a couple-- How much Mountain Dew do you need? I mean, let's be honest. This place had a lot of problems when I walked in. Where are the comments "I'm crazy?" Oh, these comments. This is a mainstream daily paper. This is the first one. "Would be nice if these folks would stand and declare their stand with the USA instead of trying to creep around and make nice." People are more hateful on the internet than they are to your face. "Until I can draw cartoons of Muhammad without fearing for my life, I will never embrace Islam or those who practice it." This guy's, like, really intense about what his, his cartoon drawing practice-- Like, his illustrations are more important to him than like, just basic human tolerance. I think there's more Islamophobia today than there was after 9/11. I think after 9/11, uh, America was kinda like, "Wow! Who are Muslims?" "You mean 'Muslim's' not a cloth? What?" I grew up in north Jersey, where there were two ethnic groups. You were either Italian or you were my father. That was it. But no one had a problem with my father the Arab Muslim. In fact, my school teacher in third grade asked me to bring him to school for show and tell. If I did that today, people would protest, saying, "What are you trying to make our children Muslim?" The reality is, is that in the last year, we've seen quite a dramatic uptick, uh, in anti-Muslim propaganda and bashing in the public square. This is a well-financed, well-organized, well-researched and orchestrated effort to try to push Islam to the margins of American life. It really came out with that... sort of islamic cultural center at Ground Zero thing. [newscaster] In lower Manhattan, protestors vowed to stop the Islamic Cultural Center planned just two blocks north of Ground Zero. It was so insensitive when they announced the mosque in that location. Don't forget that's my territory, Manhattan real estate. You would've thought there was an apocalyptic, you know, invasion going on of, you know.. We're literally sitting in, like, a pool of ebola that was gonna be placed right next to Ground Zero. And the crazy thing to me, I, like, live in that neighborhood. There's been a mosque there ever since I-- I think it's been there, like, 40 years. So everybody was just looking around like, "Yeah, God forbid a mosque coming into the neighborhood. Who knows what's gonna happen." Like, I think there's one there. What's amazing is actually... talking about the Burlington Coat Factory in southern Manhattan being an inappropriate spot for a religious center because that's suddenly the Ground Zero Mosque. This is New York City, are you fucking kidding me? They can build whatever the fuck they want, where they want it. A mosque can go right there in the hole in the ground if they want it. It's a place of worship, for God's sake. First of all, if you are in New York, you know that three quarters of the cabs are Islamic cultural centers. You just get in a cab and there's an Islamic cultural center going on. If you talk to your cab driver, you're gonna learn something. No mosque, not here, not now, not ever! Betty was like, "I wish these folks the best. They may well be setting themselves up to be killed." The people who perpetrate this hate and intolerance towards Islam, are not entirely different from the people in Islam who perpetrate hate and intolerance toward others. I feel like they should all get an island together and be intolerant toward each other. This one's a fun one. "As far as I know, all terrorists are Muslims. Get lost Muslims." That last part was in all caps. [rock music *] [cheering and applause] Hi! So... Thank you very much for coming out. We're, we're doing this really unique thing called, "Having a Jew host the show." Um... [laughter] Please, a big welcome for Scott Blakeman. Everyone, Scott Blakeman. [applause] Thank you so much! Dean and Negin. My mother loves to compare me to all my other friends, and tells me how great everyone else is doing. [laughter] Because she knows, right, she has a list of all their names with their salary next to it. [laughter] You know, I spoke to Marian the other day. Apparently, her son Bobby is doing very, very, very, very well. [laughter] Remember Michael was a nothing in high school? Now he's in the top, top, top, top, top law school doing very, very, very, very well. [laughter] I'll say, "How about my cousin? He's in prison." But he's a model prisoner. [laughter] So I recently started dating somebody. Uh, yeah. And thank you...for the two people who care, okay. [laughter] And the way we met was because I was-- we were-- [stammering] I was wasted, um... and, uh, I was standing in the middle of the dance floor at this bar. And I noticed this dude checking me out. And I could tell that he was a Jew, right? Now how could I tell, right, like he wasn't, you know, wearing a yarmulke or spinning a dreidel the way Jews always do. [laughter] You know, like, he didn't have a bagel-face, he wasn't trying to sell me property, um... But there was just something about him. Just a look in his eyes that just sort of said, "I don't believe that Jesus Christ is the messiah, oy!" Right, just like that, look in his eye-- You guys have seen it. It's like a Jesus with a line through it, okay. And so I did what any good Muslim girl would do, and I let him grind up on me right here. And so we're on the dance floor, we're dancing. And then at a certain point, the lights turn on, signaling the closure of the bar, all right? Now this is always an awkward moment because you have to decide whether or not you're gonna make out with this dude despite knowing exactly what he looks like. So I asked myself, "WWARCOAD" What would Arafat and Rabin do circa the 1993 Oslo accords? [laughter] Common self-inquiry. And so we ended up making out like a couple of peace-loving diplomats, uh... And now, you know, every night in the boudoir, you know, uh, with every, uh, sweaty embrace, I feel like we're getting that much closer to peace in the Middle East. I really do, um... Thank you. It's uh, it's called a two genital solution, um... So that's what I'm doing for peace in the Middle East. The question is, "What the fuck are you guys doing?" Start boning, you guys. My name is Negin Farsad. Thank you! One of the things I think is really cool about the tour is that there's comics on the tour who are all Muslim and we're all totally different. I am not drunk... but the doctor who delivered me was. And as a result, I have cerebral palsy. For those of you who don't know what cerebral palsy is... It, uh, just means I shake all the time. So I'm a little Shakira, Shakira. A little Tickle Me Elmo. I actually decided to get married on my 33rd birthday. 'Cause 33 in America is hip, it's cool, it's young. 33 in Arab years is 67. So I was like, "Where can a 33-year-old Palestinian Muslim virgin with cerebral palsy from New Jersey catch a husband?" And then, it came to me. And I went and caught a husband the one place I knew I could. I went to Gaza. You wanna know why? 'Cause they got no place to run. I don't know, like, if Muslims watch this documentary, if they'll consider these comics proper representations of Islam. I'm, I'm from Egypt. I'm from the Middle East. Our parents moved us to the United States September the 8th of 2001. [laughter] I was fine on the 9th... [laughter] Pretty good on the 10th... That's about it, really. Omar, who seems pretty le-- easygoing about Islam, but then when you have this-- actually have a candid conversation. He's got very strong opinions about who should be called a Muslim and who should not. I've talked to Negin and I'm like, "Well, do you believe in, like, the fundamental values of Islam and stuff?" It seemed like she was... She didn't wanna answer. It doesn't concern me if people question my, you know, my religious faith. To me, to call yourself a Muslim in the United States in this day and age, is really a minority designation. I'm affiliating myself with a larger social and political struggle that's happening in the United States today, that I want to end. Even if you break one or two or three or several sacred rules... Guess what? People still identify with their religion. To me, if you self-identify as a religion, uh, sincerely, then that's the religion you are. I'm of mixed heritage. My mom's Italian Christian, my father's Palestinian Muslim. Anybody Italian today? Any Italians? All right, we got a few Italians. The rest of you maybe can relate to being Italian. Have you at least been to the Olive Garden? Here's the difference between Italians and... more specific ethnically, Arabics. It's when something bad happens... And I don't mean between us here... I mean the difference between the Mafia and Al-Qaeda. It's when something bad happens, Italians, like Sicilian guys they'll be holding... a gun over a dead body. Like, "Officer, I don't know, I think he shot himself in the back four or five times." Al-Qaeda calls up and claims responsibility for things they could've never done. They go, "Okay, do you know the eclipse? We did it for Allah." I don't think there's such a thing as half a Muslim. You're either a Muslim or you're not. If anyone is to say, you know, "Well, I am a Muslim and a Christian." I think that's a, uh... I think that's blasphemy to both religions. No single Muslim should claim to be the best Muslim, simply because certain aspect of religion that her or she follows. We have our heart in exposing people who haven't been exposed to an Americanized face of Islam. And I don't think they've seen that enough. They always see somebody with an accent or somebody who's got a really thick mustache. Or maybe just a uni-brow. Maybe they've only seen Muslims with uni-brows. I'm tired of being judged by the craziest, most intolerant, nutty, murderous, uh, homicidal nuts on the planet. And then trying to figure out where I am on their scale. It's not their scale, it's my scale. Scott Blakeman, your host. Negin Farsad. Omar Elba. Maysoon Zayid. Thank you, you guys were great! God, I mean it was really, seriously. Did you laugh? Oh I laugh-- I cried. I cried. Cool shades, man. Oh man, thanks man. Gainsville was a great show. What a way to make up for Columbus. It was packed. Very diverse audience. Probably 10% at best, Muslim. It was great. There were Jews, there were atheists, there were Christians... I think there was a dude who was calling himself a humanist. It makes me start feeling that maybe we're onto something good here. Thank you, guys! Probably easier to find moonshine than it is to find Snapple. How can there be no Snapple? What is wrong with these people? These little guns don't seem as violent as regular guns. 'Cause they're toys. - 'Cause they're so... Hats, Dean, hats. You look like you're going to Sunday church. Very dainty, very, "Do you want some tea, perhaps? Something lovely?" [British accent] Oh, what can I get for you? Would you like some religious piety? I'm Dean. Dean, I'm Pat. Nice to meet you, Pat. Negin. Pat, nice to meet you. We're out here and we're doing a show. It's a funny show. I hope you-- It's free! - It's free. It's right down the street. We're gonna do our show for about an hour and ten minutes of comedy. And have a Q & A if you wanna ask questions. We're sincerely trying to meet people and talk to people. Well, how do you feel about 9/11? I was not shocked the woman asked what we thought about 9/11. Because that's not the first time I've heard it from people. But for some people, they never heard a Muslim denounce 9/11. No, I think that it's, it's absolutely horrible. And to us, the terrorists are not even Muslims. They're terrorists with a political agenda. No, but I mean, like sincerely, is there any other way you can view 9/11 outside of abject horror? Obviously we think 9/11 sucked, you know? What other answer do you think you're gonna get? Most people's education in the West about Islam today has been through the prism of news and not very good news. I think that a lot of the coverage of Muslims is about terrorism. Which often lacks a moderate voice because you're talking bout terror, um, inherently. And so the conversation right there is very dramatic and over-the-top. The media's done a terrific job of being incredibly detail-oriented and nuanced about varieties of Muslims. That there's one kind and that they're all really mad. It seems to me like an accurate portrayal, no? Is that wrong? Do we strike you as American? I didn't know that until you told me that. Okay. I was thinking you're Muslim Muslims. Muslim Muslims. - Yeah. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. - Nice meeting you. Our idea for Lawrenceville, Georgia was to set up an "Ask a Muslim" booth right in the town center. Look at this clearly anti-Muslim rhetoric going on in this town. "Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon." Hopefully people are gonna have some questions from a Muslim. Questions like, "Are you allowed to wear that outfit?" [over megaphone] Come as a Muslim a question. Today is the day. A live Muslim is here to answer your questions. Negin, anything? Uh... In your shrill voice, wanna add something? If you have a question for a Muslim, uh, let us know. Ask us questions. [siren wails] People of Gwinnett County, we are here to answer your questions. I'm good thank you. No, you have any questions? Do you have any questions about Islam? Not to join, just about us. We're not trying to get you to join. Why do some Muslim women look like you, and some Muslim women, you can't tell who they are. They could rob a bank and you couldn't identify 'em. You wouldn't be able to identify 'em. That's a really good question. The choice of whether or not to cover yourself is completely a personal choice. In some, like, more conservative societies, like in Saudi Arabia, um, the people-- that has been sort of codified and women do it, you know, because they have to. But there's countries like in Lebanon, women don't cover themselves. Iranian women in the United States... I'm an Iranian-American, um... like, I'd say, this is a completely made-up statistic, but I'd say like 98% of us don't cover ourselves. They look like me. Well, you're dressed like an American. [Negin] Yeah. I am an American! - Okay. Yeah, I'm American-Iranian. Yeah know, there's only one kind of American, and that's American. My ancestors are from Holland. Uh-huh. But I don't claim to be a Dutch-American. Right. - I'm an American-American. Right. To me, if you want to be a part of this country, you just gotta be a part of it. Tell me why I haven't seen Muslims who are not extremists criticizing the Muslims who are being extreme. Why are not the people of peace speaking out against the people that are doing... these things? I kinda resent sometimes when people are like, "Muslims need to prove to us that they are not dangerous." Why? Why do I have to prove to you that I'm not dangerous? Historically, you're the dangerous one. I'm actually... should be more afraid of you. If you're constantly trying to prove that you're the model minority, it's exhausting. Why do I have to fight against a stereotype that I am not? You know, to say, "What can Muslims do?" You're like... Living your lives and when you notice when someone's crazy or violent... Yeah, try not to help them. World Trade Center was a traumatic event and... like, there was no big Muslim outcry against...what... that, that particular thing. I was like, oh, so maybe it's like, you know... like a Red Sox fan who lives in New York. You're secretly, you know... There is acts of terrorism done every day by corporations and governments and groups of people... who are not Muslim. And I never hear a word. You know, I don't walk around denouncing, you know, child-fucking, every time somebody brings up Catholicism. How much molestation went on... and the effect of that on the environment, as opposed to the, you know, the effect of 9/11 on us, which was more of the, the trauma of being attacked, 'cause we'd never been attacked. Well, everybody gets attacked, okay? It's called the "tough shit" rule. All Muslims have condemned it... locally or nationwide. I don't know what else to do to convince Americans that we have condemned this. What are you doing today? - I'm in advertising. If you had to come up with an advertising slogan for Muslims to help us reach out to fellow Americans, is there any kind of campaign you could help us with? I think something kinda funny to include something that, um, feeds to someone's paranoia... "Muslims, not just for violence any--" You know, gotta include it. The other brown meat? No, that doesn't work. That doesn't work as well. Have you ever met a Muslim who lives here in Gwinnett County? No. - Ali. Ali lives here. He's Muslim. He's lived here for 10 years. I wanna introduce you to a Muslim. We want people to meet each other. This is Ali... So, if you guys are free at 8 o'clock, we're gonna be performing at the Aurora Theatre. And they're also doing a run of "The Chorus Line." There's probably no Muslims in that. We had four or five good conversations, though, today. You can't ask for more than that, sincerely. Let's go inside. There is a... a sighting. There might be Snapple iced tea lemon, which is a big day. [fanfare with horns] [applause and cheering] Say, "Salam alaykum." Open with "Salam alaykum." Okay? - Calm down. Hi, can I speak to Asem, please? As-salam alaykum. This is Negin. I just wanted to ask you, uh... for breaking Iftar tonight, um, would it be okay if we, if we brought food with us... to, to share? 'Cause there's, like, seven of us. We thought it would be great to reach out to Muslims in a small town in Georgia. So we call up this local mosque and said, "Can we get together?" And would it also be okay if we brought with us a Jew? [laughing over phone] I know, he's like, he's like, "You're treating him like he's a bag." No, I don't-- No. Awesome, thank you so much, I appreciate-- We really look forward to meeting you. Okay, bye. He's super nice, he's like, "Yeah, bring a, bring a Jew. Everyone's welcome." Awesome, awesome. Oh, look. Here's some evidence that Muslim children like, um, slides. Let's just cross that stereotype off the list. Muslim kids love slides. Okay, let's go inside, guys. - Ready, let's go. Oh, we already brought pizza for you guys! We brought pizza for you! Our pizza isn't good enough for you guys?! Maysoon, how excited are you to break your fast right now? I'm so excited to be breaking my fast [indistinct]. And then I have people to break fast with, which makes it so much tastier. Yeah, I think a very typical Muslim fast-breaking food is pizza. Absolutely, in the time of the prophet, it was-- Right, and Muhammad said, "Please add some parmesan cheese." Are you the one who called me earlier? Yes. - "I'm bringing a Jew to the--" [talking over each other] We're gonna make t-shirts-- - And that's him! This whole thing is to meet as many non-Muslims as possible through our shows. That's why we did it for free. And in many places we wanna talk to people who are Muslim in the community, to see what it's like for you-- I think it's really important what you're doing. Because, I live in Phenix City, which is Alabama. And, uh, when I call my friends, they're still like, "Alabama, man!" - Yeah. "You got people coming at you with guns and everything?!" I said, "Don't worry, I got one of my own." Hell yeah! So, but-- - Do you have any? Yeah! I'm not doubting you, I didn't know if you were kidding. Man, you guys don't know about freedom unless you live in the South. It was really interesting to hang out with Muslims who live in the South. Some of them own guns, which I find really fascinating. For us, some of it is, like, trying to show people that people that are in politics or on the far-right, that they don't represent mainstream America. And the big thing they preach against, gays and Muslims, infiltrating America, imposing Shari'ah law... Do they know what Shari'ah law-- Do they think we actually wanna impose Shari'ah law on a non-Muslim? I wish somebody would come out and say that, you know, in front of me. And I'll let them know the facts. Just one question. Where? Show me. Prove it to me and I will be out there in the rally with you, day and night. - Yeah. Shari'ah. Uh, people us that term now. This is the new fear in America. That if you pander to Muslims, Shari'ah, will, will prevail in America. [various newscasters] Unfaithful wives should be put to death. That shocking headline in a local American paper. Another example of creeping Shari'ah. Shari'ah law has been creeping into America. What troubles me is the mainstreaming of the Shari'ah. Radical Islamists want to impose Shari'ah on all of us. Some people would infuse Shari'ah law in our court system. I honestly believe that. Minnesota seems to be on its way to be America's first Somali-Muslim state. I am not aware of a single city, state, county, block, neighborhood, anywhere, that, where Muslims are saying, "What we really need around here is Shari'ah law." This idea somehow, that an outside system of religious justice would become the law of the land and women would all suddenly have to cover their heads and-- You're like, how do you argue with that? I never heard about Shari'ah law, ever, growing up. Don't know what Shari'ah is. Uh, but suddenly, I'm probably trying to impose it. [kids together]: Shari'ah law. Commonly held misconceptions that get ridiculously spread through the ma-- at large! Shari'ah law is totally gonna take over. The postal system is gonna be operated on camelback. I'm one of the few enlightened New Yorkers that believes in Shari'ah law, unfortunately. There's a certain amount of penance, instant penance, to Shari'ah law, to chopping somebody's hand off, that really is good. Female circumcision is going to be the norm here in the United States. Yeah, there's big plans to get into the clit-chopping business. I've always been crazy about halal food. I think it's tasty. Uh, good quality control. And if you can get it from a food cart... I mean, come on, it's, it's tasty and convenient. The pickup lines are gonna be like, "Oh, that's a beautiful black fabric you have on your face. Wanna fuck?" If Shari'ah law's imposed, I'm outta here. 'Cause pork is really... Pork's too important to me. That may actually be the primary relationship in my life is with pork. Not in a sexual fashion, but I, I love pork. Shari'ah simply means "the path." It's the path. And it means the component of Islamic laws that Muslims are supposed to follow in their life. I don't- I'm not allowed to lie. It's a part of my Shari'ah. Part of Shari'ah, is for Shari'ah cannot be implemented in a place where the majority of people, or where the law of the land is not Shari'ah. We already have a constitution. The first clause of the First Amendment says, "Congress shall make no law establishing a religion and abridging the free exercise thereof." Well thanks again. We're gonna go. Thank you! Thank you very much! - Bye! [acoustic guitar and vocalizing] This is like my second time ever. There's no guarantees that the ball is effectively gonna leave my fingers. Hi guys, how are ya? Come on over. This is cool. We have another one on our team. Sure. I can't believe so many people showed up to bowl with us. And they brought their kids and stuff. Like, they want their kids to meet a Muslim or whatever. Bowl with a Muslim. I don't think Muslims do a great job of reaching out to the rest of the community. And look, we're all guilty of it. Uh, my parents lived in East Brunswick for like 25 years and I'm not sure we went and talked to, like, two neighbors. Yeah, those two lanes are saved for Muslims and black only. We're here today at the Peach Bowl Lanes to meet with all the comedians for "Come Bowl with a Muslim." I like to bowl all the time 'cause I feel like it's a good workout. Going for a spare, Negin. As long as I beat Negin, let's be honest, as long as I do better than Negin, I don't care whatever happens. Come on, Negin! Come on, Negin! You can do it! [Dean] In the gutter! Oh, not bad. I'm not bad. I've never found Muslims to be that funny in the first place. Because I never bowled with any, any Muslims before. So this is my first time. In many way, we present ourself as an exclusive community. I think, as an imam right now, it is the most important responsibility, to push, ah, farther, the Muslim, to integrate positively into the mainstream American society. I think it was a unique experience. You know, they have bowling alleys in Kuwait and stuff like that. But I never think about going there, ever. I was deployed there. First time was Kuwait. And I did a tour in Iraq, as well. When I was a troop in Kuwait, I couldn't really experience, you know, their culture and their lifestyle because I wasn't allowed off the base. And same thing in Iraq. So I didn't really get a chance to really experience Islamic culture, um, how they, how Muslims work exactly. 'Cause I mean, I didn't know any Muslims. When I started interacting with them, I found out they're a lot like me. Watching this game today, you know what unites all of us Christians, Jews and Muslims? Mediocrity in bowling. No one was really good. [chanting] One more game! One, two, three. [picture snaps] People always ask me what Iran is like. Here's a little fun fact about Iran. Iran is an Islamic Republic. Uh, really fun, okay. And because it's an Islamic Republic, alcohol is banned. So it actually feels a lot like Prohibition Era United States. Right? 'Cause people are getting wasted. It's like the Roaring 1320's over there. You know, they're just doing it at the Iranian equivalent of American speakeasies. And speakeasies are the same wherever you go, right? There's always, like, that one dude, Hasan, who runs the joint. And he's always like, [imitating Edward G. Robinson] "Oh, you better get your Muslim rear end over here and pay for that bathtub gin, see!" Right? That guy? And then there's always, like, that one kid, Ussef. He's like the hoodlum who's up to no good. And he's always like, [in 1920's slang] "Aw, geez boss, I think you're the bee's knees, but I better go move my jalopy better they start the Friday prayer, see?" Right, that, the kid. And then there's always, like, that one dame with the chador that never stops. And she's always like, "Well, you local boys are lucky I don't tell the local imam how splificated you are." And Hasan's like, "Oh, you better get that dame outta here!" And Ussef is like, "Aw, geez boss! Don't do that, I mean, I think I'm in love, I mean, look at her eyebrow!" So there's-- So there's just a lot of, like, "See?" You know what I mean? And, and that is literally what Iran is like. I live with my girlfriend. She's from the Middle East. She's Arab. She's lovely. She's an actress. She does voice-overs, but there's one place in America she will not get hired. I'm gonna be honest with you. Anybody ever listen to relaxation tapes? It's like calm music. Very soothing. It's like, "Breath in, breath out. You have nothing to worry about. Everything's going fine." That's nice. American's won't relax hearing, [with thick accent] "Breath in, breath out. You have nothing to worry about. Everything's going according to plan. Close your eyes, you're almost in paradise." No, she's a lovely girl. She wants to go on vacation to Mexico. Who's been to Mexico? People been to Mexico? I had to buy this thing called a Rosetta Stone. You guys know this scam, the Rosetta Stone? Rosetta Stone does not teach you how to make a sentence. It teaches you random phrases, in this case, in Spanish, which you memorize, and wait for moments when you can use them. Like, it taught me, "The coffee is hot." I don't need that. I'm going to Mexico. I need phrases like, "How much for a kilo?" "How do I stop diarrhea?" "Hey, where can I buy a gun?" "Please don't shoot me again." Here's an actual phrase in the Rosetta Stone they taught me. I'll share the phrase they taught me. "The boy is under the plane." Where could I use, "The boy is under the plane?" What scenario could we conjure up? I'm at an airport in Mexico City, a mother comes in crying. [in female voice] "I can't find my son. Last I saw him, he was playing on the tarmac." And this is the moment I have trained for. I get up and I exclaim, "El niño está baja el avión." And then in Spanish, she goes, "What plane?" I go, "I have no idea what you're saying. But the coffee's muy caliente." Hey, how are ya?! Welcome! Welcome to the Quality Inn in Birmingham, Alabama. I put a towel on my chair 'cause I didn't wanna actually touch my skin. Oh shit, dude! A fucking roach in the fucking, uh, light! [thick Southern accent] There seems to be a roach in, like, the light in the bathroom. And I'm scared of roaches. [laughing on phone] Yeah. Okay, let me see if I can get the maintenance guy to come over there. - Oh, please do, 'cause, you know, I won't be able to go to sleep or especially go to the bathroom and I gotta go-- I've been holding it in for awhile now. Okay, I'll have him come up. Well bless your heart, I do appreciate you. Just loves you. - Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Put it in here, I'll let it soak for a little while. There's no light switch. [laughing] There's no light switch for this lamp. [laughing hysterically] And so we've been screwing it in and out. There's stuff like, falling from the walls. Like, you can't really see it on the camera. But it looks like people, like... like, masturbated and then flung their jizz onto the walls. And then the jizz, like, slowly dripped down the wall. [in thick Southern accent] Come on down, folks! [over megaphone] Good old people of Alabama! Come on down and let's see if you can name that religion! Exodus means it's in Old? Exodus is Old Testament. - Yeah. You wanna play, "Name That Religion?" A round of playing this game. Name That Religion. We're gonna read a quote. - Mmm-hmm. And you're gonna tell us if it was Old Testament, New Testament, or the Koran. Okay - All right? Now Americans know almost nothing about Islam. Nothing. They have never looked at the Koran. And if they did, they wouldn't know what they found in it. Three questions. If you get two right, you get, you win any of those prizes. Alabama shot glass, right here. We've got this "Christmas Always in Alabama, Birmingham." I know, I see you salivating already. And yes, these are salt and pepper shakers. So they're-- that's one prize? - So this is-- That's one prize. - These are a real possibility for-- in your future. [bell dings] Here we go. Which holy book stipulates that a girl who does not bleed on her wedding night should be stoned to death? Old Testament, New Testament, the Koran. Ah, doesn't bleed on her first night? Ah, the Koran. I'll say Koran. Koran. That was a very quick answer. And why do you, um... Why did you answer that way? Because of women, women are subject, you know, subjective to men. It is the Old Testament! Deuteronomy, dude! Dude... ...eronomy! There's an awful lot of going into the Koran and looking for, uh, lines and scripture that seem violent or ugly in one way or another. And of course, what is never said is that these kinds of statements can be found in virtually all holy scripture. All right, here's another one. I really want those... those salt and pepper shakers. - Oh you're eyeing those-- We can't give that away, you've gotta earn that, buddy. I'm not kidding around. Here we go. Okay, which one says that if you work on the holy day, you shall be put to death? Gonna go with the Koran on that one. No, my young friend! It's actually from Exodus 35:2. [overlapping conversation] This is the worst contest I could've been a part of. I can't expect people to understand the nuances of Islam. We've, we've grown up in a Judeo-Christian world where those traditions are remarkable familiar to us. People know about them without knowing how they learned about them. Mary said, "My Lord, how can I have a son when no man has touched me?" He said, "God thus creates whatever He wills. To have anything done, He simply says to it, be, and it is." See, my last impulse was wrong on that, on the, on the one, so I'm gonna go with, say, Old Testament. Dude, it's the Koran! What is wrong with you, buddy?! Come on! There's no Jesus in the Old Testament. You know, among the many prophets that Muslims believe, Jesus is one of the mighty prophets. I cannot consider myself following Muhammad, unless I consider myself as a follower of Jesus Christ, Moses and other prophets. "Put your sword back into it's place, for those who live by the sword, die by the sword." I'm thinking, Old Testament. The New Testament, New Testament. New Testament. Uh, I'll take Old Testament. I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go Old Testament. [altogether] New Testament! Very close though! Because they both have the word "testament" in the title. So because of that, behold... - You still get a prize. Behold what you have here... - That's so giving. Don't air this because I'm an ordained minister. No! Are you an ordained minister? These are very abstract quotes here. You know, there's not a whole lotta difference between the three in some cases. Then that's maybe the point we're trying to make. Okay, everybody. I'm sure there's just tons of garbage in the Koran, just, it's full of contradictory statements and on one hand, it's all about peace and love and on the other hand it's about death and violence and, uh... I mean, every religious tome has that. If something makes people act like less assholes, then I'm all for it. I mean, the reason religion exists, is that people were acting like such assholes, somebody was like, look, just set up some, so here's the way you act, right and wrong. You know what I mean? We went to Tupelo, Mississippi to try to get on the American Family Association's radio show. The American Family Association has a very powerful media presence for conservative Christians. And this was exactly the group, you know, we wanted to reach. Islam wants to completely silence and neutralize Christians everywhere in the world. That's exactly what the homosexual agenda... wants to do. We list the American Family Associate as a hate group, primarily because of their anti-gay rhetoric. Recently, like a lot of other religious right organizations in the United States, though they've moved into Muslim-bashing in a very big way. We sent an email to the American Family Association hoping to get on their radio show. They said no. We just showed up anyway. We pulled up to their offices there in Tupelo and they look like a normal corporate office, except for the big Ten Commandments right in front of the door, like tablets, not like a picture, the actual tablets of the Ten Commandments. It was a little nerve-racking going there uninvited. But we did manage to meet the general manager and he actually seemed pretty willing to talk to us. You know, like, for, for, for me to say, "If I'm gonna be a good Christian... I wanna follow that book, I need to try to be, be as obedient to that book as I can." A Muslim, to be a good Muslim, wants to follow the Koran, because that's his holy book. Well, what about all those places in the Koran, uh, that say, you know, "kill the infidel and the unbeliever" and things like that? Well, my mom is Christian Catholic and I was raised with both religions. Mmm-hmm. I went to Catholic school and the priests would tell us we don't take the Bible literally. It's more parables and morals for you to lead your life. Like touchstones for you to lead a very good life as a Christian. Well, we do take the Bible literally, so... [Dean] Do you know in the Koran-- There are a couple things in the New Testament that I also think maybe aren't necessarily-- Like, there's one thing that says, "Bring people before me..." Luke 19, we read it to people and they all thought it was from the Koran. I said to him... when you read it literally... and they're Evangelical Christians, they take the Bible literally, it says that... Bring those before me who don't agree with me. And if they don't' accept my reign as king, slay them, execute them, literally execute them in front of me. "Bring here those enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them, and slay them before me." That is, as you've said, a parable. He's not saying, literally, there, you know, bring my enemies and put 'em in front of me and slay them in front of me. So they take the Bible literally, except for if it's weird and violent, then it's a parable. Except for when it's in the Koran, it's always literal. Here's the problem though. Here's the problem. Just like that there are some people out there doing horrible things in the name of Christianity that we would stand against. There, there are, there is a great fear about the growing, um, I don't know, I don't know how you would like for me to refer to it. But we refer to it as a jihadist mindset. He was very nice to us. He was very diplomatic. But he did have some strongly-held beliefs and one of them is that 1% of Muslims are jihadist. Well there are four million Muslims in America. So 1% of four million, that would be 40,000 people in this country who hate America and who have the 9/11, you know, the guys on the 9/11 mindset. When you break down the statistics, that means that 40,000 Muslims in America are jihadist. That's when you realize... Oh, these statistics are totally made up. And this is their way of a subtle demonizing talking point, to make you go, like, that sounds reasonable, sure 1%, I'll accept that. Then they go, "That's 40,000 people in America who wanna kill you." Of course you're alarmed! The American Family Association has been around for a really long time. I wonder sometimes, when we are sort of watchdogging them, when we are letting people know that this is what's being broadcast. Are we just expanding their influence and their audience? But ultimately, just deciding to ignore them isn't that satisfying anyway, because then they just keep upping the extremism what they're doing. To the point where, it really is newsworthy. 'Cause it really is dangerous. You're always-- You're always welcome here. Thank you. Bye-bye. Just need everybody to fill out one of these. Sure. - Everybody that's going in. You're not for Obama or something, right? [Negin] It's not, it's not political. No. [whispering] I am for Obama. As far as I'm concerned, Obama wasn't even born in the U.S. You just gotta push down and back. Have you seen the birth certificate? I haven't. [Negin]: Oh God, I'm so nervous about going in here. We just walk in? [talking over themselves] Excuse me. Just get in there. [gunshot] [whispering] Oh my God, I'm so scared. [gunshots continue] Check that shit out, dude! Texas, baby! Oh yeah, baby, look at this! The Muslims are coming. I'll tell ya that! We are ready! This target was Islamophobia. Look what we did. We killed it. Wish it was that easy, huh? [chanting] I'm so scared. I'm so scared. I'm so scared. I'm so scared. I'm so scared. Wait, can someone stand behind me? Can someone stand behind me? On, two, three, shoot. [screaming] Geez. It fell in my fucking... [whispering] Oh my God. Negin did one shot and is outside in tears, like she killed an animal. The casing flew back into my cleavage. Right into the tits my mom gave me. Grazed my skin and burned my skin. I kind of feel like you guys might be terrible people, if that's a good time. - Why, 'cause we shot guns? You guys might be terrible people. That was a great time. - We weren't shooting people. Oh my God, I don't ever wanna be around guns again in my life. Protesters marched through the streets of Murfreesboro this afternoon, speaking out against a planned Islamic mosque. Do you forget 9/11 so fast? It seems like the American people do. It's not about religion, it's about stopping Tennessee homegrown terrorists. We have been here for over 30, 40 years. Some people have been lived here, living here. Uh, we never had a single incident. This mosque that they're trying to build. All it is, is a training center. So to say now, you know, oh, you know, this is gonna be a training camp, well... I mean, you know... What is it? Where is the evidence? It will be a breeding ground for terrorists. I mean, duh! This is the Bible Belt and Murfreesboro is the buckle on the Bible Belt. We're at the proposed mosque location in Murfreesboro. It seems like a really bad place for a terrorist training camp. 'Cause it's, like, right next to a church, that might, as a neighbor, look out and be like, "Oh, are you guys training terrorists? 'Cause we just saw a bunch of dudes walking in formation." This is the work of a national agenda, during the primary, the scare tactic, to steer people away from real problems. A proposed mosque in Murfreesboro has all of a sudden become political fodder for a congressional race. The Islamist is not a religion like Baptists, Church of Christ, Methodist. I don't trust one Muslim in our military because they're commanded to lie to us. Oh wait, we have unemployment. [yelling] What about those Muslims?! Oh, we having trouble creating jobs? [yelling]: What about those fucking Muslims?! It never surprises me when politicians pick up an issue that's divided a community and jump into the fray. Because I think they can score political points on one side or the other. The Republicans say Muslims are the worst things in the world. The Democrats say nothing. Anytime you have a powerful, uh, emotion that you can utilize, to stir people at their adrenal level. That makes honest and clarifying conversations more difficult. Anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2010 went up by 50%. That was, by far, the most dramatic rise in those kinds of crimes we've seen. Uh, and I think that that rise is driven almost entirely, uh, by politicians, uh, and other propagandists who make these kinds of anti-Muslim statements. There has been deep penetration in the halls of our United States government by the Muslim Brotherhood. "Deep penetration," those were her words. Police in the western suburbs are investigating yet another attack on a Muslim building. At least seven people are dead after a gunman opens fire at a temple in Oak Creek. Worshippers strongly believe this is a hate crime because they are often mistaken as Muslim. The Muslims, as far as I'm concerned, are God's children, just like all of us. I think, uh, the Murfreesboro residents have gotten a bad rap. That, but people that don't support the mosque, I think, just don't fully understand its function. From my completely non-scientific research, my position is that Murfreesboro is, like, pretty progressive and that, and that most people actually want the mosque to be built and they're fine with it. That's true. Test. Test, one two. Muslims. This is certainly not true about all Iranians, but with my parents, they're just, like, a tad bit racist. For example, my mom, she called me to tell me about her new accountant. And she was like, [thick Persian accent] "Negin, he is Indian, but that is okay, because with money he is like a Jew." It's like a double insult compliment. I don't know what that is. And it's funny because black people get it the worst, right? She'll be like, [Persian accent] "Ve vent to the store and behind the counter was a black person, of course, and he was just sitting there flipping hamburger. Disgusting. But it literally doesn't matter, what the black person is doing. She'll be like, [Persian accent] "Ve vent to the United Nation, and the Secretary General was a black person, of course, and he was just sitting there analyzing humanitarian aide. Disgusting! It's funny because whenever I do that joke in front of Iranian audiences, they're always like, [laughing] [Persian accent]: "Yes, ve don't like black people. That is so funny because it is so true! Don't like black people. No, no, no, no, no." When I come to Islam, as an African-American female, I don't wanna hear comedy from Muslims that degrade African-Americans. You need to be, uh, highlighting the fact that the culture of Islam is to bring people of different ethnic groups together. Black, uh, Muslim experience is, is always gonna be different because we have a component of slavery, uh, you have a component of oppression, Jim Crow... Baked into the basic philosophy of Islam is, is anti-racist philosophy. Now does this mean you don't have racist Muslims? No, it means you got 'em. They're there. President Obama talked about race in a very honest way. He said his grandmother, who was white, he used this term. He said she was a typical white person. If she was alone on the street and saw a group of black men walking towards her, she would get nervous. And there were white people going, "What?! We never fee like this!" Come on, white people. Look, if you hate all blacks, all Jews, all Arabs, all Muslims, all Hispanics, you're a racist and a bigot. But if you're afraid of certain people, in certain situations, you're just a white person. You can't help it. You're alone in the street. Four black guys walk up dressed like Barack Obama. You're not worried at all. Four black guys walk up dressed like G-Unit, maybe you're concerned. You see an old Asian woman walking on the street, you don't care. You see an old Asian woman driving the car next to you, you might get nervous. If you see four Arab guys in a deli in Nashville, you don't care. You see four Arab guys about to board your flight speaking Arabic to each other... You then run up to the black guy you used to be afraid of, for protection. Say "shizzle my nizzle that might be a terrorizzle." [traditional ranchera music *] Show business everybody. This is what it's about. This is a dream come true for me. When I was a kid, I thought maybe one day, El Casino Ballroom, Tucson. Could I move chairs before the show? Yes, I can! [ * ] The El Casino Ballroom in Tucson was the most unique place I've ever performed comedy in my entire life. You could feel that the space was sort of really set up for these great Mexican cultural events and so it was kind of hilarious to have a "Muslims are Coming!" show at a place that normally sees quinceañeras. What's up Tucson? Whoo! Yes! Thank you. Thank you for coming out tonight. So I'm Syrian, uh, my father is actually Syrian Muslim and uh, my mother was a South American, uh, Catholic, uh devout. So, when I came to this country, I didn't know shit about sex. Nothing, okay? The most I had seen was eyes and ankles, all right? I would walk to school. And I remember I was walking to school one day and I saw a loose piece of porn on the ground. And I looked down and I was like, [whispering] "Oh my God." [gasps with ecstasy] And there was another piece and another piece. It was like breadcrumbs of porn, leading me to this giant box of pornucopia in the middle of the fucking woods. I don't know how it got there and I don't care. I took a couple of those magazines to school, to show my buddies. And one of my friends was like, "I'll buy it off of you." And that's when, like, that Arab bazaar light went off on my head. I was like, [with thick accent] "Wait a minute." I still had an accent back-- I was like, "Wait a minute. I could make money off of this shit." So I went home, And I categorized my pornographic material. It's true. I went to school the next day like a professional. I was like, "What do you want? Black, white? Breasts, booty? I got it all." And I thought I had a great rep, guys. I had money in my pocket. I was like, "America is awesome!" You know? 'Til I came home one day. And I heard my mom upstairs crying. I had 450 magazines left. [laughter] And true to form, man, my mom's Latina and she just, like, set up the scene. She had, like, all the porn scattered everywhere. She was sitting on the edge of the bed trembling. [in mom's voice] "Ay Dios mio, Kareem. Ay Dios mio!" [sobbing] "Look at this porno! Porno! Y porno, porno, porno! Porno! You the porno boy!" [sobbing] And in the back of my mind, I was like, "porno boy." You gotta end the Islamophobia, people. That is basically, I'd like to say, racism, you know? And I'm saying this 'cause racism effects everybody in this room. Trust me, I've been black a long time. [laughter] Racism effects white people, too. Racism is the reason why white people don't have their own month. [laughter] Work with me here! Black people have Black History Month, Latinos have a heritage month, Muslims have Ramadan. What do my white brothers and sisters have? Nothing. Nothing! You don't have a caucasian awareness month, a cracker appreciation day, or a whitey week, or honky hour, a salty minute, a rich reminder, an ofay-okeydoke, a pale pause. Nothing! [laughing] Some of you all are laughing, some are like, "This negro has gone too far." Look at the Muslims laughing. They're like, "Ha ha. Mmm." It's all right to laugh, Muslims, it's not illegal yet. I saw this guy on TV in the state of Utah outraged, completely true. He goes, "There are 1300 illegal aliens living in our state." He's pissed off. I live in New York City. There are 1300 in my apartment building. And I don't care. If you're not committing a crime, I say, "Welcome to America, my friends." My father was an immigrant, my grandparents were immigrants, my girlfriend's immigrant. Secondly, if you have snuck, from Mexico through Texas, New Mexico, Arizona. You made it to Utah. I think you've won. I think you should get more prizes the further north you make it, in fact. Like, like a reality show. Like "The Amazing Green Card Race." You line 'em up. First ten to Maine, get a green card. Rest go to Canada, get health care. That's how it works. Everybody wins in my game. No losers. If we're gonna talk about genitals. We may as well talk about genitals. I had to, um... take an STD test, uh, not too long ago because I, I was a raging slut for a period of my life that ended, uh, last week and... [laughter] The good news is, that the vagina is disease-free and closed for business until marriage, uh... you know, or until a gentleman caller takes me out to a restaurant, um... I have standards, uh... And STD's are so scary, right? I was so scared that I actually decided to tell my mom that I was taking this test. And it's already hard enough to say to your mom, "Look lady, I fucked a bunch of dudes and I might be diseased." But... to say that in Farsi, right? Where... I don't know what the word is for "sex." Nor do I actually think that there is a word for "sex." Is all the more radically awkward, right? Because my mom was like, [Persian accent] "Eh, Negin, vhy are you scared? Have you had inter-gender flesh relation?" [laughter] Yes lady, I've had inter-gen-- "Have you had inter-gender flesh relation vithout security of a external safety product?" And that's the thing about, like, you know, sex and sexual issues with a, among Iranians and Muslims in general. I feel like they're so closed off about them, that they don't even know the appropriate language to communicate. I mean, like... Can you imagine President Ahmadinejad doing a public service campaign on safe sex? Right? He'd be like, [imitates musical intro] "Practice safe, inter-gender flesh relation, and destroy Israel." [imitates musical outro] [laughter] Hi. So, yeah, we just wanted to ask- We were- we were commenting on how brave it was for you to just... ...come out and talk about your sexuality on stage. - Did you notice the Muslim women left? - They- Yeah, they left. One of them was like, "Let's go!" and like twelve of them got up and left. I've gotten this- I've gotten this response before. I'm not gonna sit here and say that Muslims are awesome on gender. They're not always awesome on gender. There are some barriers that are... ...beyond the normal barriers that a Muslim comic would have to face. You don't only have to break through the-the- The Muslim thing, but there's also a female thing. It's very easy to marshal cultural hostility towards women. They never have said in my- I think- in the history of reviews, "White comedian So-and-So, why is he so angry?" "He was unattractive. I didn't like his pants." "He's fat." Being a female Muslim comic... I can't even imagine what that- what that would entail. The amount of... ah... ...stepping between raindrops that that must entail. [laughter] [Farsad] Tonight's Tucson show is really hard, 'cause I've been sick. I've been touring while sick... um... "T.W.S," if you will. During my set, this group of hijabi women, which are the women that cover them- their hair, just, like, got up and left. And does it hurt my feelings like, so much, to see a group of hijabi ladies like, walk out on my set? Like, absolutely. You don't know how that feels. That feels awful. It's a stricter society, ah, in regards to women. So, my cock jokes are gonna go down smoother than when Negin, for instance, tries to take a cock joke down. It's funny, 'cause I'm just like, it makes me want to curse more. It makes me- I'm just like, "Oh, did I not mention my anus?" "Lemme mention it." I have no material on my anus, but I'm gonna do that right now because I'm so mad. I think you've gotta be edgy to do it. I think you've gotta- You've gotta cut through the nonsense. I would much rather the edgy Muslim who says "vagina," is the one that we're more associated with than the edgy Muslim who kills people. [Farsad] It makes me sad, and I wish I had more support from some subsets of the Muslim community, and I don't. * * All right, so where do we go? Here it is, The Complex. The Complex. It's exciting. * There's a show on, like, Discovery or History channel that's just called [spooky voice] "A Haunting." You ever seen this show? [various audience murmurs] And they- they like, they re-enact the whole situation. It's always: [TV announcer voice] "It was the Peterson's dream home. ...until it became a nightmare!" And then, you know, they have the Petersons there going, "We can feel something in the house." "We knew we weren't alone." "We could feel a presence there." "We just knew. Weird things were happening." "Lights were going on and off, doors were opening and closing." "The refrigerator was out, the oven's pre-heating." "The lettuce is wilting." "We didn't know what to do." ...every episode. [laughter] "And then we had to call a priest." Every episode, they call a Catholic priest. [laughter] Why do only Catholics move into haunted houses? [laughter] You've never seen an episode where a Muslim or a Jew move into a haunted house. You've never seen that, like... There's reasons for that. It's because you're not gonna scare a Muslim out of his house. It's not gonna happen. You can try, you know: "Boo!" "Ah, 'Boo.' You're so scary." "So, ghost... hey, come here everyone." "It's a ghost." [laughter] "It's a ghost." Muslims are in touch with the spirits. "You want to haunt a house, haunt a house." "It's fine. You can haunt the house." "Yeah, we have an attic. Plenty of room, you can sleep. Just don't go in my girls' room. Don't go in daughters' room." "Don't go in there." "They're very young, very young, very young." "Too young." [laughter] "They're only twelve years old." "They'll be married, like, three weeks." "Don't, eehh, don't go in there." But the ghost... Always a Puritan or some pioneer from 1847 or something, you know what I mean? It's always some last-century ghost. Never a Muslim or a Jewish ghost. You'd know if you had a Middle Eastern ghost in your house. Like, "We think it's a Middle Eastern ghost because the whole house smells a little bit like cologne." [laughter] "It's a little bit garlicky, and a little bit cologne." [laughter, applause] "The hair gel is missing." [laughter] "And there's a trail of chest hairs all the way up." "I think he's Armenian." [laughter] I had to go back to California to visit my parents, because my aunt was visiting from Iran. And, it was the first time she had been to the United States, ever. And I had to go down, to like, respect my elder, right? And, um... So I go to California, and, um, and I- I was like, "Oh, my God, she's never been to the U.S." "We absolutely have to take her to eat a taco." Right? And, my mom is like, "Oh, that is good idea. But how is taste, taco?" And I was like, "Lady, what do you mean 'How is taste, taco?'" "You've been living here for fucking thirty years." "You don't know how is taste taco?" [laughter] [small, accented voice] "No, I don't know." And I was so mad. I was so mad. I was like, "You fucking immigrants come to this country..." [laughter] "...and you don't try Mexican food?" [laughter] "You're just un-American." [laughter] You have to understand that... ...that these immigrants come to this country, and they love this country before they've ever even set eyes on it. And that's something I think most people don't fully understand. They- you know, people question the patriotism of immigrants, all the time. It's become a regular part of the American discourse. And, it's always shocking to me... I'm so embarrassed, I'm such a fucking cheeseball. Okay, fucking, turn your vagina down, here we go. So it makes me very upset that people, like my parents, um, would ever be subject to that kind of questioning, because they- they gave up everything so you can live in this place that, in their minds, is the- is the best place in the world. To me, being a naturalized citizen is actually, in some ways, makes you more American, 'cause it wasn't just happenstance, it was an affirmative decision on our part, that this is the country, and the idea, and the principles, that we believe in, hence we came here, and became citizens. I'm afraid, in the future, 'Muslim' will become like the N word. You won't be able to call us Muslim. You'll have to call us, like, a politically correct term, like... "pork-free Americans." [laughter] And only Muslims will be allowed to use the word Muslim, like they walk up to each other, like, "What up, my Muslim?" "Where my Muslim's at?" "Oh, Muslim, please." [laughter] And I- Because I look like a white guy, I don't look like an Arab, you don't have to be Arab to relate to this, if you don't look like what people think you should look like, they don't know your heritage, and might say terrible things to your face about your own background. This happened to me: I'm in New York City, public laundromat, TV's on, the guy goes: "Hey, buddy... You see these freakin' Arabs?" "I have an idea..." he goes, "Let's kill 'em all, and let God sort out the good and bad ones." I'm like, "Sir, that's not nice. I'm Arab." He goes, "You don't freakin' look it." I'm like, "Well, that just makes it easier for me to achieve the goals of my mission." [laughter] You know, we're doing this for the next generation of Muslim Americans, so they grow up in a country where... they're not treated less than American, and less than equal simply because of their faith, which, to me, is the antithesis of this country. My father died in 1998, uh, and growing up, we watched the news together, and there'd be news stories about a terrorist attack committed by Muslims, and my father would always say to me, "These people are not Muslims." "Muslims do not kill innocent people." You know, that's the way my father viewed being a Muslim. Uh, so, I-I think he would... ...hopefully, be proud of what we're doing. What a great moment for Muslims. Because you are- this is your opportunity moment. The eyes are upon you now. When the eyes are upon you, that's when people see you as human. Be proud of who you are. And sometimes that means you're gonna take a little bit of flak for it. But you have to be proud of who you are, because it's kind of all you have. You have to appeal to what is un-American about Islamophobia. You have to make an appeal based on American values. And I think that Americans rise to the occasion. A lot of times, what we perceive as... ...malevolence, is ignorance. And not ignorance borne of hate, ignorance borne of ignorance. In the Koran, God says, over and over, that we must get to know one another. If you know someone who's Muslim who's in your little league, or in your bowling league, or whatever it might be, you think, "Oh, I know Ahmed. He's a good guy." "What are they bustin' people's chops for," right? The more you can interact with people who might hold some of those intolerances, the better you do. Hey, we work with you. We're your neighbors, we're nice. We make pie. We hate gays, but, uh, outside of that, we're just nice normies. And then, if we start intermarrying, and... ...and really start fucking like rabbits, it's gonna take a while. * While we were in Salt Lake City, we went outside the big Mormon temple, and held up signs that said "Hug a Muslim." [man, shouting] Go back to your own country! Oh, wow, that dude just told us to go back to our own country. And he's a dick! Yeah, he waited for the light to turn green, and then he was like, "Go back to your country!" - Like, it's... - How dare you hug people! How dare you want to offer warmth and affection? Meanwhile... was born here, buddy. I woulda chased him, but my ankle's fucked up. You know what I'm sayin'? But I woulda- I probably woulda caught him, 'cause I run, like, a 4.3, NFL was calling me, but... I think you look like you really need a hug. - Let's do this, yeah! - What's your name? Negin. Yeah, let's do it, right here. Bring it in, buddy. Yea-ah! [laughter] [indistinct chatter] [Farad] People were just lining up to hug us, which was like, you know, it was really touching. [laughing] Have a good one. Bye. Yea-ah! Yeah! Yeah! [laughter] - You got another hug. Hello. - Yeah! Yeah. In Salt Lake, I felt the most emotional connection with people. That they just didn't hug us, like this kind of perfunctory, "Ah, hug, thanks for coming." They hugged us, like, they held us. And... like a child. I felt- It was great. It- you really felt it right through you. And we all felt it. They meant something by it. * [cheering, clapping] - We're so happy for you! - Thank you. - Congratulations! - Thank you. Congratulations. [laughter] Damn, we're hugging bride and groom. I feel like we weirdly figure into their marriage. They're always gonna think back, "Remember that day we hugged a Muslim?" - I know. - The happiest day of our lives! Or, they're gonna think back, like, "We're getting a divorce, because remember that day we hugged a Muslim?" * We went to the South, we went to the West. Most people, frankly, do not care about Muslims. They're living their lives, they're busy. It's a tough economy. Very few people care about us. Sadly, it's these people on the fringe in America, the f- not the right, but the fringe right of America, who've created this narrative that Muslims want to take over this country, that they want to destroy Christianity, they want to impose Shari'a law. And they're not the mainstream Americans we met. This notion that there's throngs of people out there that just sit around, hating Muslims, I- that's not the case, and I think if you watch, um, mainstream media, you often get the sense that there are people being whipped up into a frenzy about Muslims, and... Americans just aren't like that. - Let's do it, let's do it. - Group hug. [cheerful chatter] * *
