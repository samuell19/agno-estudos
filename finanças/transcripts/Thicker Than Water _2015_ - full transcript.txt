-My mother used to say that existence was a wave. -It's created out further than we can imagine. -From the depths from of something great. -Something urges it forward-- -Until it breaks the shore. -Then it rolls back, only to begin again. -She told us that life then was the metronome. -Constant rhythm and constant motion. -Life happens in the music played between each swing. [Engine Rumbles] How could you not tell me? Sorry. -I was trying to protect you. -What about Chris? We made a deal. We leave them alone, they leave us alone. Ivan says they're all out. It's just Gemma. -We sure about this? -He's a child! I know. I just want us to be sure. [TV Noises] [Door Crashes Open] -Where?! Hey! Hey you guys can't be in here! -You have to go! [Struggle] -Got all your stuff? Ready to leave? Yes. One more word and this family-- --unseals its lips! -Please? Don't take him. -Come on mate! -No! You can't take him! Chris! Come here sweetie! You do not talk to him! Come. [Gasps] [Fast Footsteps] [Cue: Dance Music] Alright. Let's wrap that up! We're gonna look at you two girls next, alright? [Music Stops] Oh, love of my life! So we've got a 06:00AM class do we? Money, honey. If you keep taking on this many classes, you may die here-- Before you get a chance to own the damn place! I mean look! Look at this! You keep going at this rate, you'll have the complexion-- -Of a crack whore. -Thanks. Don't worry baby. That's why God gave us concealer. I don't think that was God, Tin. Well, some people have Jesus... I have Napoleon Perdis. Millie? Since when do we-- Have classes this early? Since my meeting with the bank is in two weeks. You know how you could save a fortune on concealer? I'm not morgaging the goddamn house, Tin! Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. It's their house too. Family loyalty. Blah, blah, blah. Wank, wank, wank. You're an insane person, you do realise this? -No. I'm proactive. -Proactive? My God, she needs to get laid. You're not my type, bitch. Is this ridiculous work schedule and your... Dazzling wit, a cover? For what? His year is nearly up. Yeah, probably. Shit! I'm late! Can you take the rest of the girls for me through-- -Please? -You know I can. -MWAH! -GO! [Quick Footsteps] [Door Closes] Well that went well. Alright girls! Let's make it hot! [Cue: Pop Music] [Phone Rings] [Trolly Wheels Grind] How's it feel to be a free man? Almost. You ah? You on your way? -Yeah I am. Your sure this is a good idea? Kidding me? Of course it's a good idea. [He Sighs] D? Yeah, righto. I'll see you soon. [Engine Rumbles] [Phone Vibrates] Yeah, what? -Hey, I just saw D. He must be out of rehab. Oh, is he? Hey, um? -Can you, can you spot me? Alright. [Engine Rumbles] [Doors Click Open] [Doors slam] How was practice? Fine. Fine, uh. We ran rings around them while-- -They jerked themselves off. -We're still going to Archie's right? No. Going home. Ah... Your said you wanted a coffee at Archie's. Yeah. That was before my fifth one. Whate about if we get you a... -Decaf? -No. I'm good. [Texting Clicks] Millie! We... can go-- And get you some wine. I've got wine in the cupboard. We uh - we can get you somethingelse? Ivan! Sweetie! Enough. I tried - I tried. I tried. [Scuffling sounds] -Hey D! -You got tall! And you got skinny -- And you got skinny -- Didn't they feed you in there? Didn't they feed you in there? -For God's sake Ivan, it was rehab - not prison! Millie... What are you doing here? Surprise! Happy birthday to us right? Happy birthday little one. Do I get a hug? [Tinkling of glass] You look good. [Pats Arm] Not as good as you birthday girl. Suck up. Where are you staying? Right. You want to stay here? Kind of. Yeah, I was hoping to move back in. Permanently? Jeez, you got some balls! -Part of my charm...? I don't think that's the best idea. Why? What's the problem? Millie... [Glass slides across counter] Come on. Just give it time. -No. -What do you mean no? I mean no! You can't stay here. -THAT IS BULLSHIT! -WATCH YOUR MOUTH! Go get Chris set up please. You know this house belongs to all of us? -Ivan, it's okay. -It's not fucking okay! You know what? When you start paying-- For the rates - you can have a say! Go! [Heavy Footsteps] Are we going to talk about this? Nothing to talk about. [Scoffs] You're so full of shit! Waltzing around like "little miss bleeding heart". Taking in Chris-- -You're turning away you're own flesh and blood! -SURPRISE! Susha, it's okay. I can stay in a hotel. -Here we go. -Well deal with it quick! Guests are arriving in half an hour. -Seriously? -I'll be in the kitchen. I'll be in the boudoir! -I can't Sush... -He's fucking clean, okay? What more do you want? D, I think you should leave now. -Sure. -Don't you fucking dare! It's my birthday too. Fine. [Gulps] Okay... You people could really learn a few things from-- The Patriarch family. Alright then. Apparently I have a pitbull to style. -Back in the closet darling? -Unlikely! Welcome... home. Cheers Sam. [Cue: Party Music] [Fumbling Sounds] [Door Clicks Open] -Hey Henry. -Hey... [Indistinct Chatter] -So Macca comes out of nowhere! -Up the outside and leaves em' all for dust! -And wins the bloody match! -I'm telling ya! -The kid plays better with a hangover! -He does! -Hey D! HEY! [Laughing] -Henry! -Welcome back man! -Oh, God. Clearly that one's for you Susha. -Goes with the decor. Presents? Just over there, on the table mate. So...how you doing man? Yeah. It's nice to be home. Man, its good to have you back. We got our 'flanker' back as well? -I don't know. -Hey, you're not going on soft on me? -Nah. -Come on man. I want to see you at training next week, alright? Oooh. -She don't look too pleased man. -Yeah. -You noticed that, hey? -Mhmm. Hey listen. You just hang in there-- -And she'll come round. [Packet Rustles] I'm sorry about this afternoon. Oh, you don't have to. There's never a dull moment in this house. [Group Laughs] It's better than you think. [Laughs] -You okay? -Yeah. Fine. Hi. Hey. [Mouths "Shit!"] [Running Footsteps] -Shit. Shit. Shit. [Shutters Crack] -Oh! Honey! I know. Don't let him in. Susha already has. Well... -Can't deal with that! -Come on! None of that, Miss! -It's been two years! -I know... -I've had alot of drinks! -I know! Look at it this way. It's never gonna suck more than it does right now. -How's that? He got even prettier. - [She groans] -And now he's a war hero. It's not like he was on the front line! -He was a medic! -No. But he was saving-- -The lives of the boys that were! Oh,can't you just picture him in his uniform? Or without? Come on! Putyour big girl pants on and go say "Hi"! Or I'll get Sam to drag you out... You know my way's-- -Less painful. [Indistinct Chatter] [Footsteps] -Hi... -Hey... -You're back? -I am. Sorry...I didn't say "Hello". You're not really sorry. No, I'm not. You even tried to... climb out the window-- -Didn't you? What are you doing here? Happy Birthday. -Do you mind if I stay? -Yes. Well, tough. Smooth. Seriously? Nah. It-it was fine. Yeah, you're not really selling it man. It's because you're lazy. I could deal with the early mornings-- Just um...not the shit coffee. Women really love the uniform. Yeah, in a desert. I kinda liked it. -Being over there... -You strip it all back. -You find this...um... -Kind of... I don't know. Clarity. That's really deep man. Fuck you guys. [Laughter] -Enjoying the view? She's not going to make it easy-- On me, is she? A snow ball's chance in Hell, mate. -I like those odds. -Mmm, you could do better. [Water Splashes] [Plates Clink] [Washing Sounds] Dry. Yes, Maam. [Footsteps] [Garbage Rustles] -Hey mate, welcome back. What are you doing here? [Spitting Sound] [Snorts] A little birdie told me-- Someone had finished up their 18 month-- Stint in the funny farm. I knew home would be the first stop. Figured I'd be the second. Thought we'd save you some travel time. [He Laughs] What can I do for you, Nic? Uh, you tell me. Mate, you're the best 'Runner' I ever had. -Boys and I would very much-- Like you back, Dimmy-Boy. Thanks for the offer. But you and I are done, mate. Come on. We're family. You and I. Hey? You leave all the members of your family-- To overdose in the gutter? Do you? Yeah... It's what I thought. [Sniggers] Good. [Footsteps] [Exhales Audibly] [Wind Blows] -You can't do this on your own anymore! -Please just... -This is insanity! He should be protecting you! [Indistinct TV Chatter] -I can't... I won't watch this anymore! Fine then! There's the door! GO! [Procelain Shatters] -Do what you want! -I don't need you! [Door Slams] [Cue: Melancholy Music] [Irregular Breaths] [Heavy Footsteps] [Water Splashes] [Fumbling Noises] [She Gasps] [He Groans] [Exaasperated Growl] [SLAP] [Heavy Breaths] [Whimpering] [He Cries] You're okay... It's okay. You're okay. [Music Fades] What are you still doing here? Just cleaning up a bit before I head. [He Sighs] [Cleaning Sounds] Where's Chris? He went home. Susha, I'm going to be late. Jesus. [She Laughs] You're the one who wanted him to do soccer. Ivan, have something to eat please. I'm fine. Just eat. Would you save your maternal crap-- For someone who actually wants it? -I'm not a fucking child! -Hey! Or why don't you feed D? Because he is not welcome in this house! Yeah, okay! Time to go! See you tonight. Still the same around here, I see. D, I think you can go now too. Yeah, sure. -One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. [Cue: Waltz Music] -Why would you plan a surprise party-- When we had work in the morning? 'Cause we're sadists. How much did you drink? -Ugh... So much so, if I have to listen to this song-- One more time, I'm putting one of these geriatrics'-- -Heads through the speaker. -Okay! That is all we have time for. -Oh, thank God! [Clap Hands] So, the kitchen sounded-- Like a bundle of laughs this morning. Yeah...? They were getting on my nerves. Would you like me to get out-- My tiny violin? Such a bitch. Do you think you were a bit harsh? [Phone Buzzes] Yeah, hello? WHAT?! -What's he done this time? Broke the nose of another student-- One Mr Simon Dawson. You've got to be kidding me! What the hell were you thinking? Defending Chris Townsend, it would seem. -Excuse me? -Young Ivan here, took offence-- To a conversation revolving around Chris and... Felt the need to-- How did you put it Ivan? -Thump him. -Thump him. Right. Ludmiller, we have a zero violence-- -Policy here. -Of course. We understand. Take him home-- And keep him there for the week. He's suspended. Thank you. [Footsteps] -What's going on with Chris? You're on a scholarship for that team-- You need to be more careful. Don't. Ivan, you can't just go around-- -Hitting people! -Millie! Seriously, don't! Okay? I don't want to say something-- I'm going to regret! Okay! [Phone Buzzes] But you're smarter than this! What if you were expelled? Huh? What then? I'd become a mechanic. Good work, Ivan. Say the first thing that pops into your head! -Oh, I will! -Get into fights! -Real fucking smart! -YEP! Next time, why don't you use that big brain of yours-- And think before you act! And stop behaving like such afucking child! [Door Slams] [Mumbling] Ivan?! Ivan? [Footsteps] Ivan! [Door Slams] -Nice one. [Knock at Door] [Mumbling] You've got to be kidding me! I'm just going to grab my stuff! -Sorry, he called. Sounded upset. -It's fine. -What's going on? He got in...a punch up. Sticking up for Chris. Chris? Chris Townsend? -Yeah, they're friends. -Ivan's not going-- To the Townsend's place, is he? -Yeah D! I let our little brother go and play-- Sleepovers with your old dealer. Or is it previous employer? So he hasn't stayed there? [Fast Footsteps] What are you...? Sweetie? I'll have him back by 8PM. You coming? Nah, I got plans. [Door Closes] [Rustling of Paper] [Door Slams] -Can I drive now? -No. -Please? -No. Please! -NOT A CHANCE! -D?! Maybe the car park at the beach. YES! I knew I liked you! You're a little turd. [Engine Rumbles] [Cue: Melancholy Music] [Waves Crashing] [Wind Blows] Do they teach you this Zen stuff in rehab? Not really. Kind of. Yeah...it's got something to do with it. Why are you asking? Well, you're all calm and boring. Yeah, well, get used to it. You know boring is boring. Look Ivan, I'm still me. So you're back permanently? I don't know. She has the right to kick me out. You hurt her pretty bad, you know? When? You know when. I didn't know she told you. She didn't. You know when I was little-- I used to beg Santa every year to-- -Bring me a sister. And all Mum did was pop out boys! [She Laughs] Stop stressing. Ivan's a good kid. [Wine Splashes] I'd like to keep him that way. I mean, D shows up and within five minutes-- He's in a punch up! And there's something going on with Chris. That one is not your responsibility. You should have seen D this afternoon. He actually asked me-- If I let Ivan stay over there! You can't blame him for being jumpy-- When it comes to Nic fucking Townsend! [Water Splashes] D? What aren't you telling me? [Engine Rumbles] [TV Noises] Hey! Hey you guys can't be in here! -You have to go! [Mumbling] No you got to go! [Struggling] He'll kill you for this! One more word! One more-- You can't do this! He was going to leave you alone! After he went and saw you-- He said it wasn't worth it! He was at our house? Please don't take him. Come on. No! You can't take him! CHRIS?! Come here sweetie! You do not talk to him. You do not even look at him. Come. [Gasps] [Fast Footsteps] [Video Gameplay Noises] What are we telling Ivan? That Nic kicked him out. -Hey? Can we take Chris to that beach? -What beach? -The one near the... -Uh, pawn shop. It's not what it sounds like. -Get out! -Millie! Your having chit-chats with Nic Townsend-- Out the front of our house! And your taking our little brother to the place-- Where you used to deal drugs. I will not do this again! Nic came to the party. And I sent him away. And I didn't take Ivan to Mullem. Why else would you be in Mullem? [Clunk] I had some money sitting in an account-- While I was away. And I wanted to get it back for you. Am I supposed to be grateful? -You...stole it. And pawned it for drugs. Our dead mother's ring-- Didn't mean anything to you then. Why should it mean something to me now? I called him. I had a spare bed. I'll help you bring it up. -Yep. Thanks for this man. -It's not a problem. -You back for good? -Yeah. Looks like it. Yeah, well just don't hurt her. Like you did? You don't remember! You were too little. Susha slammed my heard-- Into the door on the first night! -Yeah, that 's right. -I remember. You probably deserved it. Shhh. -Right I'm off. Hey, thanks a bunch man. Eh, don't even worry about it. Hey, you won't be thanking me-- When Susha crawls in after a late night, ey? Hey, you should stay man! Millie has enough food in the oven-- To feed the third world. Yeah, least we can do is feed you. Thanks guys, but-- I have to get home. Thank you. You...are welcome. Don't push it. [Cue: Eerie Music] [Bed Sheets Rustle] [Cue: Melancholy Music] Not with me. Never with me. [Whimpering] Okay...? [He Cries] [Plate Clinks] I want him back. I heard you the first time. You might have heard me. But you haven't done-- Anything about it. What do you want me to do? Oh... Don't want you to do anything, mate. 'Cause you're fucking useless! I'm going to make those fuckers regret-- Every fucking step-- They took into my house! [Pats Shoulder] -No. Why not? Take him to a hospital. He doesn't want to go-- I'm not going to force him! Well, then get the doctor to come around. -No Jon. -Ludmiller?! The guy spent 2 years in the army- as a medic! -I'm aware. Then use your brain! The kid needs to get checked out-- And refuses to go to a doctor. Whatever! You don't really care! How you holding up? I'm okay, I guess. Yeah...okay. You need to make a phone call? Just the cops, you know? -Just one cop, actually. Stopped me on the way home from school and-- Started asking me all of these questions. I didn't know what to say, so-- I just nodded. You didn't call him? No. I watch enough TV-- To know how these cases go and-- I don't want it all over the news. It all passes. Wouldn't it be better in the long run? No. It will pass in a few weeks or-- A few days. And they'll move onto something else. But I'll still know the same people. And go to the same school. And, I don't want that. Seems like you've thought about this alot. Yeah I have. Kind of. Whatever. Can I offer you a little bit of... Whatever? One day, you may feel different-- To how you feel now. And perhaps, you'll wish you acted sooner. Look honey, all I'm saying is... On that day-- If you need someone by your side-- I'll be there. We all will. We're your family too, Chris. [Indistinct Shouting] See! Not even the first day-- And it already feels like "home"! Excuse me. -You don't! Go and have another beer! You're impossible! You are so full of shit! You expect me to believe-- That you've got Chris' best interest at heart? You couldn't have cared less-- About him last week! And now you're using-- Him to get one up on me! I don't know what goes on-- In your crazy fucking head! -But... -Whatever Susha! Because, despite everything we've been through-- I can still pull it together. If you're such a fucking saint-- -Then why don't you, put your own relationship-- Bullshit aside? Get Jon over and do-- -What's right for Chris? -Hey, hey, hey! ENOUGH! Clearly, going to hospital with a battered kid-- Going to draw some unwanted attention. So, to avoid the 'Child Services' apocalypse... Jon will come over-- And tell us what to do. -He is not... -Oh! Mmm! Be smart. You can't heal him with-- Hugs and hot beverages. That's why he needs a doctor, not a medic. Yes. But then you'll be-- In the middle of a court case with a drug dealer. While trying to buy your own dance studio! The bank meeting is tomorrow. You need to be prepared. Not worry about Chris. I will see you tonight. And you... Need to remove the dick-- From your forehead-- And start helping your sister. I help out. Keeping the fridge stocked with beer-- Isn't helping. [Nail Biting Sounds] Don't bite your fucking fingers. You need meditation. Smithy, you ever heard of it? No. Why? There was this samurai, right? Not my kind of thing - deprivation. But the one thing they did get right-- Was meditation. Now, old mate was a master of it. When his family was starving in the winter-- -He went to hunt. -I'm about 5 away. And stumbled on a Sica Deer. -This thing was too fast-- For his arrows. Way too smart-- -For his traps. [Mumbling] -So what did Sensei do? Cornered it, in a cave. -Plonked himself down in the lotus position. [Footsteps] Legs crossed. Fingers poised. -Feet up-turned. -Stayed that way for-- Five days and five nights. Without a twitch. -[Loud Slap] -[She Gasps] On the sixth morning... The deer emerged-- And wandered right up to the old fella. [Muffled protests] [Sounds of Struggle] [She Cries] -So what's your point? The point...DICKHEAD! -[Nose Cracks] -Is waiting out your enemy is a discipline! You fidget fuck around-- And you give yourself away! [Screams] -HEY! [Whimpering] This isn't over by a long shot! [Scream] Are you okay? [Cue: Melancholy Music] Now, you're going to feel a little-- -AH! Do I at least get a morphine whistle? Oh fuck, Sam... The thing...tomorrow? -The thing? With the bank? It's okay, I'll get it rescheduled. [Sheets Rustle] Where the hell do you think-- You're going now? Parking's going to expire, I need to move... Oh sit down Millie, you ridiculous woman! -I will, I just... -NO! You are going to stay here-- And get stitched up! -I'm not leaving until the boys get here. And then I'll move your damn car! [Gasping] [Vomits] Oh, don't look at me like that! I don't spew when I'm drunk. She's in 206, let's go. -Susha? -Let's go. -DON'T! -It's okay. -No! It's not fucking okay! I can't be here. I get it. Get what? Not wanting to feel. I turned it into an art form. -Yeah, you did! -Thanks for that! -Okay. I'll take that hit. But you're not as good at it-- As you think you are. And why's that? Because you wouldn't be trying this hard-- To be an asshole. If you weren't so torn up inside. Now come on. You have to go to the cops! No, I have to have a cup of tea. Where are Ivan and Chris? -We sent them to the movies. Tin has gone to get you all some food-- -He will pick them up. -Good. -Ludmiller, you cannot let him get away with this! We bring the police and we lose Chris. Oh, Jesus! Would you all stop looking at me-- Like I'm a time bomb? We knew it wasn't going to be pretty, alright? -Millie? -Susha! It's done! I need to have a shower. -I'm going to kill him! -Yeah, get in line! [Water Runs] [Cue: Melancholy Music] [She Cries] [Footsteps] [Door Knock] Millie..? [Door Creaks] D? Let her go. [Waves Crash] [Wind Blows] [Birds Chirp] [Sheets Rustle] -Wait. -What happened to your face? -I'm fine. Wait...just wait a minute. What happened? Ludmiller? Shit... [Door Slams] Millie? You alright? Where have you been? Went for a walk. Alone. Woah. What the hell happened to you? -Ivan! Shut your mouth. Millie...? I better get ready for work. Let's go have a chat. [Footsteps] [Phone Buzzes] [Keys Jingle] He did that to you, didn't he? Look at me! You're safe. It's done. No police. Chris stop it! This is not your job, okay? I'm fine. [Door Slams] [Rummaging Noises] [He Sighs] Nice place. What are you doing here? She came to you this morning? That'd be right. Let herself in. -Why was she all cut up? She didn't tell you? -No. Why was she all cut up? -What? -NO. -Don't buy it. She was nearly raped this morning. What? [Bag Rustles] -I'm not here for me. I'm here for her. And for whatever reason, you're it for her. She may fight you on it. And try to convince herself otherwise. But you're it. What am I supposed to do with that Dim? I want to know you'll help her. She won't let us close enough. She's trying too hard to protect us-- And I can see it's suffocating her. She's fucking drowning-- And nothing I do, helps. And now this. [Footsteps] This was you, wasn't it? What? The money in my account is gone. I didn't take your money. I would never-- Oh, I would never! I should have never-- Let you back in this house! Ludmiller... This wasn't me. HEY! D?! It's not what you think. -It's Ivan! -Nic has Ivan! -What? -Are you sure? -What the hell is going on? He went to Nic to buy him off. Nic has him now and wants to-- Speak to me. I took the limit off the account yesterday. And then we fought. And this is because... [She Gasps] -Oh, God. Millie? -I have to leave! -No. Stay here. [Cue: Intense Music] [Door Slams] -You sure about this? [Door Slams] In and out. -You've got 10 minutes, before I call the police. [Knock at Door] Oh! Hey! Look who came to see me? It's Little D! Now, I've got D1 and D2. You right mate? He's great! He brought me presents, so I'd-- Stay away from that slut sister of yours. -If this is what I think it is... Mmm, you might just be in with a chance. See for yourself. [Lighter Flickers] -Don't even think about it cupcake. Takes me back. How bout it, shiny boy? How bout this? You keep that. That stuff's all yours. I'm going to take Ivan. I'm going to take this money. And we're gonna go. [Gun cocks] You don't want to do that. I've got a friend outside in the car-- And if he hears a shot-- The police will be here, Before you can-- -Move your stock. -So, we're gonna go, okay? We're gonna go. Nic? -NIC? [She Sighs] [Paper Rustles] [She Mouths "STAY"] [Cue: Dance Music] -That's it! Ooh, yeah! POP! Good pop! Bad girls! Bad girls! OOH! I LIKE IT! YES! YES! You right? Yeah. You look tired. That's a polite way of telling me-- I look like shit. [Laughter] -STOP! STOP! I want to do that last move again-- I didn't feel like you were really committed! Look! This should be really fun! So touch your boobies! Yeah, don't be afraid to-- Touch your boobies! You've got nice boobies! So, we're gonna go down, down, down-- Toward the va-jay-jay. And thrust at the last moment! Good! Good! I like that much better! Ohno - I think that's enough touching-- For today... um... What? He called. -Said he wanted to talk to you. Well that's just great. That's my cue to go. Yeah, grab your things! Ooh! [Door Closes] [Lock Rattles] Do you wanna talk? -About? -The other day? I'm fine. -Ivan's fine. -At my place? [Keys Jingle] What is that? -It's a key. [Indistinct Voices] -I was hit very hard in the head, okay? Call it a relapse and move on. You're not over it. Because you know me, so well? I do. Did you figure that out in your absence? Oh, we out of words Jon? 'Cause there's the door. You do this part-- Really well, remember? -You know you pushed me out! -Whatever. -Well, who's running now? -I don't want to play this game! -I don't want to play! -NO?! You want me, right? -Yes. You're an idiot! You left and now you're back trying to put-- The pieces back together, when you broke-- It in the first place! I don't need some army boy to swoop in and-- Save me! I do that myself! I don't need you! I don't need D! I do it all on my own! So, whatever this is... [Keys Jingle] You can keep it! [Footsteps] Don't touch me! Are you done? I LEFT YOU. I couldn't watch you bleed yourself dry-- For someone who was supposed to protect you... -I DIDN'T NEED YOUR HELP! -YOU DID! I made a mistake! What else have you got? You left. -I CAME BACK! -TWO YEARS LATER! MILLIE! -Leave. -No. LEAVE! No. I won't. I'm so tired. I'm so tired... Do you have any idea-- How much effort it takes... To stand here and feel all of this again? On top of everything else? I don't have enough left for you. -Stop. Stop. [Cue: Romantic Music] [Cue: Eerie Music] [Short Breaths] [Bandage Rips] -Well? I'm afraid there's nothing to be done. You're gonna die. Horribly. Probably of something that makes ou go green! [Laughter] Hey, I'm not kidding! It's going to have to come off! AHHH! [Laughter Continues] -You ready for today? -SHHH. Are you? I'm ready now! [Sheets Rustle] I'm gonna go...like this! I think the bank might have a clothing-- Policy, that's a little bit more formal-- Than bed sheets. FOOLS! Agreed. Come on! Let's go! Come on! [Horn honks] [Footsteps] [Cue: Tense Music] [Light switch flicks on] [Bags Clunk] [Indistinct Chatter] -Where is she? Well? D'you get it? Yes! [Laughter] -WOO! What is going on back there? Your sister is now a business owner! -OH! FUCK YEAH! -IVAN! Sorry. Yeah? This is going to do nothing-- For your bossiness! I'm so proud of you Millie. It's a lot of debt. Yeah, but that's just the first step. Mmm, maybe. Maybe? Be proud of yourself little one. For one day. Be proud. -So... Business owner? You alright? I'm fine. [Bed Squeaks] [Birds Chirp Outside] Should we try this again? -It's too much...? -No! [Sheets Rustle] Tell me something. Tell you what? A story. This one day, we were playing soccer over there. And the... ground was so dry. It was like powder, under your feet. Every time you'd kick the ball-- There was this-- Tail of dust behind it. Like a comet. Anyway, it was scorching hot, so-- I sat down in the shade to watch, but-- As soon as I sat down, I-- Startled a little bird. -What kind of bird? It's a Desert Finch. Tiny thing. Cheeky too. I had a biscuit. She wouldn't take it-- Out of my hand, but-- If I threw the crumbs at a distance-- She'd peck away. It was the most bizarre thing-- I just kept trying to get closer to her. I thought... if I moved slowly enough. Or is she likes the biscuit enough-- Maybe she'd let me touch her. Did she let you? I got about an arm's length-- Before she flew away. Maybe it was a shit biscuit. UH! You are encouragable! [Laughter] -You are such a pain! -Get used to it! -Go and get my pillow! -Yes, maam. [Thumps and Crashes] [Muffled Shouts] You fucking bitch! -Jon? -YOU OPENED YOUR TRAP! -JON! -Millie, don't move! -My fucking stock! -Stay there! -My fucking money! -My boys! EVERYTHING! -Nic? I didn't! -I swear to you! IT WAS ME! What? [Gun Cocks] [Frantic Breaths] Well my boy. That was a mistake! -Nic... -Millie! -GO! [Gunshot Rings Out] [WHACK] [Panicked Cries] -Call an ambulance! Get some towels! -LOOK AT ME! D? LOOK AT ME! OPEN YOUR EYES! D?! [Exhaling] Oh, let me... Why am I the only one crying? They're in protection mode. What do you mean? It's not in them to fall apart. -Not in public. -They'll shed a tear, in the dark. In the middle of the night. -Maybe two on a bad day. -But while there is still things to be done... -Their grief will always get pushed to the side. -And I don't know if that makes them-- -Incredibly strong. -Or cowardly. -They were so young when they lost their parents. Maybe no-one taught them how. -Maybe it's... -Maybe it's sheer stubborness. -Maybe, uh... -Maybe they're afraid to fall apart because-- -After everything. -The pieces would crumble into-- -Fragments, so tiny... -We'd never be able to-- -Put them back together again. -My brother used to say that life was like-- -A metronome. -Constant rhythm. Constant motion. -Life happens in the music played between each swing. -And sometimes, we miss a few notes. -But the melody... -Is always beautiful.
