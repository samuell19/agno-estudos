Darn it. Yo-chan, give me one. Okay. Here. Huh? What? You have to inhale to light it. I didn't know. Even though I've seen you smoke so many times before. It's not something you pay attention to. So that's how it is, even though we've lived together for two years. Where will you live back in Tokyo? I'm going to my parents' place for now. So Yokohama, then. Hey, you forgot this. "Talisman" You can have it. I'm good. I don't really get this stuff. I think you should have it. No, I'll be fine. Here. Do we have everything? Yes. Okay, we'll be on our way. Thank you. Okay, then. Yeah. Thanks for everything. Sure. I'm sorry, kind of. That part about you really annoys me. Huh? Rena? Of course not. Huh? Whoa, whoa. What the...? What? Jeez! What's going on? Seriously, stop. What? What? How? I said stop! You don't belong here. Go away! I'm pissed. I'm so pissed. That part about you really pisses me off. What the hell is that? Seriously, it's scary. Your ex must have been sick of you too, not caring for others' feelings. What the... Hey... You're not wearing a bra. I don't want you to get the wrong idea that ghosts wear bras. I've never seen a ghost before, so I wouldn't... That's not the point. What I'm talking about is your attitude. You act nice but you don't think about anything in the end. A mere ghost has no right to judge me. I've been watching since you guys moved in. You don't admit when people point something out, nor do you try to fix it. You think you can get away by simply apologizing. That's why she walked out on you. You've been watching? Yes, ever since I died here. You died here? You have a problem? That's not what I meant. I wanted to come out sooner, but your ex had quite a strong barrier-like power. So since Rena's left, you came out. Right. Why don't you leave if you dislike me that much? I can't. You never know. I've tried many times, but I can't. I don't know much, but I'm probably like an earthbound spirit. You're no expert, then? You don't get lessons before you become one. Does it just happen? I don't know about others but it did for me. That must be hard, I guess. What are you looking at? Hanzawa, can I ask you something? What? What happened to your face? It's a long story. Did you have a fight with your girlfriend? No, I was sleepwalking and crashed into something. What? That's so adorable! Can I take a picture? Be my guest. Hey, have you ever seen a ghost? A ghost? I'm no psychic, so I don't know. A bit more to the right. That's usually the case. Are you interested in ghosts or something? Not really. Come to think of it, my aunt is a psychic. Seriously? You mean a real one? You seem so interested. Anyone would be. If you insist, I can introduce you. You don't have to introduce me to her. Suit yourself. What's this? Your face. Look. "Incense" I'll take this too. That's steep. Never mind. Okay. Smells good. It's soothing. You're still here. I said I've been here longer than you. Don't come out suddenly and scare me. The connection is still unstable. You're no Wi-Fi. You shouldn't use a mug because the ashes will fall out. A fire can... Put it out before a fire starts. I'm just a ghost. Don't expect too much. You can open the fridge. That was a coincidence. I don't have many handy features. Yeah, whatever. That's nice. It's kind of fancy. "Hanzawa: afternoon off" Hanzawa. Are you off this afternoon? Yeah, I gotta go to the realtor. Are you moving? No, I just have a little problem. A problem... Did you knock your girlfriend up? No. Don't tell me. Pre-wedding jitters? I knew it. I broke up with my girlfriend. She gets upset when she's with me. Come on, say something. Mr. Masaki, you must write a power of attorney yourself, not your son. Yes. You have trembling hands? It doesn't have to be neat. So you should write yourself... A registered seal? Yes, you need it. Don't tell me where it is. They'll suspect me if it's stolen. Yes. What? Tofu? Sounds good. Yes. Uh-huh. Mr. Masaki, I have a customer waiting. If you want to make cold tofu, it should be silken. Yes, that's right. Okay, bye. Sorry to keep you waiting. Are you looking to rent? No, I'm... There's a nice place. It's a little old, though. In other words, it has a retro flair. It doesn't even have a bath. I live in the Ohashi Apartment. I just wanted to ask you something. Ah, the Ohashi Apartment. Which room is it? Room 101. Okay, room 101. I don't know how to put it, but could it be a stigmatized property? Well, I have no idea. Why did you pause a bit? It's nothing. You're hiding something. I'm not. But you... If you have any more specific concerns, then please consult with us. Okay? Hey! What? Don't do that. It's dangerous. But I'm burning them carefully. Why do you do whatever you want? When did I...? I got that you can't leave, so can you at least behave? Jeez. "How to get rid of ghosts easily" See you. See you tomorrow. "Can you do the purification yourself?" "Burn incense" Hanzawa, you're still staying? No, I'm going home now. You should look those things up when you get home. Sorry. What? Nothing. Hey. I told you to behave. Say something. Did I... do something to deserve such blame? Huh? You know, I'm not here because I want to. If I could, I would have left long ago. But still... If it bothers you so much, try kicking me out. Well, that's... Come on, do it. What's the matter? Why not throw salt or something? Forget it. Damn it. Don't cry. I'm not crying. Leave me alone. I'm sorry. I didn't think about how you felt. So you can come out here. Up to this point is the room. It's on the floor plan as the balcony. I chose this room because I like the view. Me, too. It's the only place I can connect with the outside world now. Right. Don't you remember anything from when you were alive? Were you a student? No. For your information, I was working hard. What did you do? Well... Probably something where I had to meet people. That's pretty vague. I told you I don't remember much. What about your name? I think... I had a name with "a" and "i" in it. Isn't it simply "Ai?" Ai? Yeah. I'm just guessing, though. Ai... You'll call me by my name? Ai... Suke. Ai...suke? Yeah. Suke? Yeah. It's cute like a dog's name. Then can I call you Yo-kun? Too intimate all of a sudden. Then Yo-chan! Like what your ex used to call you. Avoid that if you know. How about "Yo-san?" Yeah, whatever you want. You like it. I don't like it. You're blushing. I'm not blushing. I wasn't peeking. Then what? I was just wondering what it's like to be unable to go outside. Want to see? See what? It's been a while, so I'm a little scared. Huh? Wait, Aisuke? I'm here. Is it creepy? It's freaking ghostly. That's it? What about over here? Can you do it? Damn, that's so awesome! What a speciality! It's exhausting, so I don't do it too often. It really was like a ghost. That's so lit. I am a real ghost. You see, Mr. Masaki, a registered seal is not a self-inking stamp. Yes, a self-inking stamp is a stamp with ink in it. If your son is managing it, then... Mr. Masaki, there's a customer. Let me call you back. No, I mean I have a customer here. I see. You cooked? That's nice. No, I don't need anything. Yes, yes. I'll call you later. I'm so sorry. Are you looking to rent? There's a nice place. It's a bit far from the station. Do you have a car, sir? Frankly, it's not very convenient to get around, but it has a great view. I was here the other day... Ah, Mr. Hanzawa, the ghost. Don't call me that. My apologies. How are things since then? Well... It's absurd, no matter how much I think about it. I can actually see it. Please tell me if you know anything. Any specifics about what happens or problems you are having? I'm saying it's there. It's just there? Well, that's right. If that's all... That's all? It's scary. Is it that scary? The ghost itself isn't scary, but I can see it clearly, and we can have a conversation. But it's not a living person. I'm worried that I've gone mad or something. You can even have a conversation? Yes. About what? You're a bit amused. No, not at all. From what you say, it sounds like there's no harm, so why don't you just accept it? It's a young girl. Isn't it great? Your life must be more fulfilling. Why do you know it's a girl? Please tell me, who is that girl? I can't do that. They're so fussy about personal information now. See, I'm keeping it zipped. I don't know anything. What about... Who is she? Even just a name... Any little detail... Hey. You're not a minor, are you? Huh? You can drink. I can. Maybe it's like an offering. That makes sense. It's really good. I drank it in no time. Then do you want another one? Yes! You drank, right? I drank. It's not empty. It's not. What kind of rule is it? Anything goes. Whatever common sense, science, or rules from when I was alive don't apply. You can or can't, or what exists or not. All the standards and common sense are gone. Everything becomes equal. Get it? Sort of. It's pretty hard because I was conventional when I was alive, but I'm trying to get used to it. That tastes weak. Apparently, this depends on the nature of the relationships. In this case, my current relationship with you. What's wrong? Why the serious face? You're drunk, even though it's not empty. I'm not! You're a weak drinker. Who knows? I don't remember that either. Why did I have to die? I had lived each day to the fullest, I think. What are you doing? It's tasteless, right? Let's get wasted! - All right! - I'll grab some more drinks. Sorry, I'm almost done. Don't worry. I'm here to talk to you. What is it? You've clearly lost your energy since you broke up with your girlfriend. Yeah? You look like a monster has sucked out your soul. It's just a hangover. Did something happen with your ex? Did she contact you or something? Not really. You show your kindness without thinking, so it worries me. You're talking nonsense. I'm serious. Kindness is more sinful than you think. You'll catch a cold sleeping here. Hey. I was so close to touching you. What? Hold still. That's cold! I touched you. Oh, my God. I did, right? Yes! I've always wanted to touch an Adam's apple. Wow, no kidding. It's pretty bony. Are you thinking, "She's never had a boyfriend before?" Not at all. That face says you are! I can't help it. I died before I had the chance. Despite that, your comments were pretty harsh. Experience doesn't matter. You'd better get ready. Damn. Sorry. Thanks. Hanzawa. It's today at 6:30. What is? The farewell party. Right. Aren't you the organizer? Don't you have to go early? I've asked someone else to take care of everything. I'm leaving the company for personal reasons... Congrats on your wedding! - Thank you. - Congratulations. Isn't it kind of weird to have Hanzawa here drinking with us? It might be the first time. I thought asking you to go for a drink may be a nuisance. Many young people don't like to drink much. You can ask me anytime. I'd be happy to go. Is that so? If that's the case... I'm going for a smoke. I'll go with you. What about you? You're a smoker, right? I'm good. I see. Shall we go then? After you. Did you quit smoking? It's not that I've quit, but I haven't smoked lately. Since you broke up with your girlfriend? Well, yeah. What? It's just that I thought you were going to get married. I guess I'm at that age. I recently broke up with my boyfriend, and he looked a little like you. It happens. Can't you take a hint? Huh? - That was delicious. - I'm stuffed. Hanzawa, don't you go back to Tokyo! I'm not leaving yet. But you will someday. Mr. Kubota, you've had too much. Everyone, to the station? I'm walking home. I'm taking a bus, so goodbye. Have a good night. - Get home safe. - See you at the office. - Let's go. - I wish you all the best. - Thanks. - We'll miss you. - Good luck. - See you. Good night. It's you... Something wrong? I don't feel like going home yet. Can I come to your place? My place? No? I'm not saying no, but... I'm home. Who are you saying that to? It smells like my grandma's house. Grandma? You have a visitor? It's tidier than I thought. I expected it to be filthy since you said so. This is my favorite. You listen to some pretty rare stuff. Maybe we're alike. I guess she can't see me. You'll leave after a drink, right? Do you want me to? I'm not saying that. So it's okay to stay, right? Well, yeah. At last, we're alone together. I always wanted this. I hope you did, too, Hanzawa. Hanzawa, you're a good kisser. What? A blackout? Sorry. I don't know why it happened. I think I just saw something I shouldn't have. Like what? A woman dressed in white. Something's still there. I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry! What is this? It's...It's like... My ears are ringing. Something's definitely there! Are you okay? It's not what it looks like! Calm down. I'm sorry things got kind of weird. It's not your fault, Hanzawa. Will you be okay on your own? Want me to take you home? Thanks, but I'm calling a cab. Right. Yes. I'll see you at work. Yeah. Hey, Yo-san. What? I'm really sorry about today. Don't worry about it. Hey, Yo-san. Yeah? The person today... Is she your new girlfriend? Huh? You just broke up with your ex-girlfriend, and now you have a new one already. We're not really dating. What? But... You kissed her, right? Kissing is not a big deal. Oh, my God! I didn't know you were like that. No man would turn down a woman who offers herself. I'm kind of disappointed. Why would you be? I thought you were the committed type. Why? You were like that with your ex. It's so embarrassing. I admired how you and your ex were a lot. Huh? I thought, "I wish I could get together with a guy like this." "Like this"... Meaning...? Meaning? That would mean you want to go out with someone like me. Sorry, that was unnecessary. That is what it means. I guess I want to date someone like you. Whoa, what are you talking about, Aisuke? It's more like I want to kiss someone at least once. Does that mean with me? You're a good kisser. That woman said... Stop, stop. Forget that. Why are you embarrassed? Well, you know... My motto after I died is "Be true to your feelings." But hey... No man turns down, right? Stop. I can touch you, too. I'm going to the bathroom. Bathroom? That was intense. - Good morning. - Morning. - Morning. - Hey. What? You're acting too weird. Sorry. Your attitude clearly suggests that something happened. Enough about that. Don't you think your place is messed-up? I'm sure there's something in that room. I saw it clearly, even though I'm not psychic at all. I don't see the harm in it. You never can tell. Anyway, you should do something about it. And the picture I took before, see? No harm has been done to me. You definitely need a ritual purification. Ritual purification? I don't know... My aunt is a psychic. You mentioned it before. At least you should see her once. Let me sleep on it. What? I think I used to like this. Yo-san? If I can touch you like this... you're like a living person. I never thought... hugging someone was such a nice thing to do. It's 100 yen a time. Yo-san. Ghosts don't have money. Don't take it literally. Aisuke. Why do you have to be dead? Really. Yeah, I wonder why. I'm telling you, Mr. Masaki... I'm hanging up. I have a customer. Okay. Talk to you later. I like ground natto. Yes. Okay, bye. What's wrong? You look so serious. Please tell me. If this is about that issue... I'm not complaining or anything. I simply want to know. Even if it's just a small detail. At least tell me who she is. But look, Mr. Hanzawa. What's the point? I know it sounds strange, but she's simply there. To me, she's not so different from the living. Mr. Hanzawa. Do you think I've lost my mind? No, it's not like that. Excuse me. I'm sorry to have bothered you. Wait. Mr. Hanzawa! It's an earthbound spirit. I knew it. What is that? It's often found in haunted places and stays in a specific area. Aunt Misaki. What do you get from this picture? Young man. Yes. You better not get any deeper into this. You could be on the same frequency with them for some reason. If it continues... What happens? In your case, you seem to be quite attracted to it. Before it's too late... No, actually, I just want to know why she's become like that. I'm not trying to get rid of her or anything. Are you out your mind? What if something happens to me? Well... Enough. Stop talking for a second. So, what can we do about it? Let's see. Hey, how was your day? I see. There is a woman, indeed. She's lost her chance to go to heaven. Don't worry. I'm not trying to do anything to you. But if you have any regrets, you have to resolve them. Regrets... I know you're not here to cause trouble. But those who live and those who are dead exist in different worlds. If you try to cross that line, there will be a certain degree of obstruction. I'm not forcing you to go to heaven. Think straight. If you don't hurry, the young man will die. What? You can't stay like this forever, either. I can't make you go to heaven. But you're not bound to this place anymore. Is that really true? There! From there, you can get out. It's the demon's gate. Come on. The key, you can get in if you have it. Damn that old hag. It's over. Okay then, be careful. - Let's go. - Huh? W-Wait. What happened? Aisuke. What? You were here. What are you panicking about? Did she do anything to you? She didn't do anything. Good. Do you want to get rid of me? Of course not. But... I'm really sorry it was so abrupt. But I wanted to get to know you better. Like what you have been dealing with and how you spent your time. I thought maybe I could do something for you. But Yo-san... Did she threaten you by saying I would die? Don't worry. See, I'm perfectly healthy. But... What's with the face? It's so not you. Yo-san. Yeah? Can I ask you a favor? A favor? I want to go on a date. Go on a date? But... I figured out how to get out. What do you mean? I'm saying, I want to go out on a date with you. Okay. But you are okay with me? It's you I want. Right. Will you take me out? Yeah. "Hanzawa: vacation" - See you. - See you tomorrow. You're on fall vacation from tomorrow. Yeah, I didn't get a summer vacation this year. I gotta use up my paid holidays. See you tomorrow. Bye, see you. Hey. Shouldn't you have a purification soon? My aunt sounds like a fraud, but she's right sometimes. You should be careful. No, I'm good. Besides, if ghosts could kill people, it'd be a much bigger deal. "Special offer High-grade incense 780 yen" From here? That's right. Isn't it pretty high? I'm more athletic than you think. Even if you're okay with it... You can use the front door. Right. You go down first. Okay. Aisuke. What is it? It's fine if you don't like it. But I felt sorry for you going outside barefoot. I didn't know your size, so I got it randomly. So if you don't like it, it's fine. We can buy another one on the way... Yo-san. It fits perfectly. Do I look good? Yeah, you look good. Is it pretty? Yeah, it's pretty. Thanks. Where's that confidence you had earlier? When it comes down to it... And with you down there, the height is more apparent. You'll be fine. Nothing is more unreliable than an empty assurance. I have my grounds. I'll catch you. What? Now. Come here. Okay. All right. It worked! I got out! So where do you want to go? Well... I've always wanted to ride double. It's your first? It's against the law. I see. So you used to be upright. I still am! Yeah, okay. You see, Mr. Masaki. We don't handle year-end gifts. Yes, there's a specialty shop at Nishikubo. It's too fast. I can't go up the hill. Wanna run? Good idea. Let's run. Hey, wait. Wait for me. - Yes. - Hello? Yes. I'm starving. Is this your go-to? Not so much a go-to place, but I come here sometimes. Hello. Here you go. What's good here? I guess Japanese savory pancakes. I'll have that too. Two Japanese pancakes, is it? Yes. "Cinema Onomichi" "Closed Day" It's closed. Is today Tuesday? Yeah. I can't believe I forgot. It's unusual that they have a closed day. It's because only the manager and his wife run the place. You know a lot. I used to come here all the time. So you liked movies. Yeah. I always came here alone, so I wanted to bring someone someday. We can come back. Yeah. Don't be so down. Here, I promise. Come on. Thanks. Whoever tells a lie will sink down to a bad place and never rise up. It's been a while since I've seen the ocean. Me, too. Yo-san. Yeah? Thanks so much for today. Where did that come from? I remember a lot now. A lot? Things that were very important to me. But I don't care anymore. Huh? Can I hug you? It's 100 yen. I'll pay when I get big. Let's buy some flan on the way home. Okay. Are you feeling a little down? Am I? What's the matter? I know what it is. You're sad our date is almost over. Yeah, I guess. Right. Why are you blushing? You just said it yourself. Let's come back together some other time. "Some other time." What? Nothing. We better get going, or it'll be dark soon. Yeah. There you go. I'm home! What was that? It's been a while since I said, "I'm home." That's right. So, I had fun today. Yeah. Let's go out again. What's wrong? I don't think... I'll ever forget today. Jeez, you're being dramatic again. "Onomichi Flan" Yo-san, you left the light on. I wanted to tell you when you were awake. But I couldn't. Saying "goodbye" is so much harder than I thought. I... didn't know when I was alive. Yo-san. Thank you. Okay, then. See you some other time. Aisuke? Damn it. What are you doing so early? Where did you send Aisuke? She's gone! Then she must have gone to heaven. Heaven? Congratulations. You would have died otherwise. I was wondering what would happen since she's been dallying. Thank God. That's good to hear. There's nothing good about it. I don't care what happens to me. But that girl, Aisuke... Did you think it was good for her to remain a ghost? I didn't do anything. It was her decision. But... Any more of this, I'll charge you. "Cinema Onomichi" That tastes good. Mr. Hanzawa, you came at the right moment. I'm picking out my year-end gifts. Please, I'm begging you. Tell me about that girl. I don't have any more clues. Your information is the only connection to her. Please help me. If you ask me like that, it's hard to say no. "Grave of the Arai Family" A name with "a" and "i" was a last name? Anyway, why did you suddenly disappear? Why not say something? By the way, you took the sandals without permission. It doesn't matter since it's no use for me to have them anyway. But doing something like that makes me wonder if it was all a dream. It's like I'm imagining all of this. It's weird, isn't it? We spent so much time together, but there's nothing left. Hey. You really were there, right? We did eat flan and drink beer together, right? The time we spent together like that... It wasn't a dream, was it? Going down. Don't worry. I'm fine with it. Do we have everything? - Yes. - Okay, we'll be on our way. "Cinema Onomichi Admission Ticket" Ai, this way! - Excuse me. - Sorry. Here. Thanks. A Girl in My Room Directed by Natsuki Takahashi
