You know when you are sure about something and you just know it? And you can't stop thinking about it? Lilly Swanson... ...would you like to marry me? See the top of that hill, Lily? Yeah. We'll build you a house up there up there one day. Come on Lilly, we got a whole life to explore, just you and I. Hi there! Hi. Can I get a table for one please. Here you go. Thank You. Hey there, what can I get ya? May I have the blueberry pancakes and some orange juice. Got it. Be back in a little. Thank you. Need some pancakes. Pancakes coming up. Here you go. Thank you. Sorry, miss. You look kind of familiar. Are you on TV or something like that? No. All right. Sorry to bug ya. Oh Shit... Oh, my God! No! Shit! Oh fuck! ohhhh fuck! Damnit! Oh my God! They're coming. There coming. How was your weekend? Good. Oh yeah? Shit, I'm hungry. Hey, Cindy. It's me again. I'm trying to reach you. Well, I'm kind of in a bind here, so... I don't know, when you get a chance, can you call me back? Hi! How are you doing, sir? Excellent, excellent. What can I get for you? Well, the baby is a little bit thirsty. So, let's stick 40 in it. Got it. All right. Didn't I see you hitchhiking up the road there? It's probably not a very safe thing to be doing, you know. Yeah. I know that, I guess I didn't expect my car to die on me, did I? So where are you headed? Don't know, I'm looking for a job I guess. A job? What kind of job are you looking for? Anything really, I'm looking to start fresh somewhere new, that's all. You know, I need a young guy who can help me get my business off the ground. Is that something you might be interested in? Maybe. Okay, well listen, I just opened up a new casino in Sparks. Sparks, eh? Where is that? About 50 miles up the road. And it's where everything is happening. And if you're looking for opportunity, Sparks is where you need to be. Okay. And opportunity is what I'm offering you. Really? What's your name? Zane. Morris. I need a young kid, a young guy... who could work hard... ...and who wants to make a lot of money. I guess I don't really have anywhere else to go. Okay, I'm in. Great! Pick that thing up and let's get out of here. Is that car yours? My Baby. Take real good care of her. Yeah, I bet you do, she is a real beauty. I take better care of this car than most of the women in my life. Come on Zane, hop in. I'll take you for a ride. You like that? Sure do, Morris. Off we go. So, here it is, kid. The cream of my empire. Morris, you own this place? The whole goddamn place. It's very, very impressive, Morris. It should be. How is the business here? It's good, but it can always be better. That's why I have the other place, Zane. Hey Morris, if you ever need help one day I'd love to help out. Well, if you play your cards right, ...do good for the other clubs, who knows? Some day you might be running the whole damn place. Shall we go check it out? Ever been in a casino before? No, sir. You've never been in a casino before? Then let me introduce you... ...to the world of casinos, Mr Zane. What can I get for you? Can I get a shot of whiskey? Thank you. Hey. Hi. Care if I bum a cigarette off you? So, where are you from, girl? It's a place called Heavenly Valley. Heavenly Valley, hey? Guess it's your lucky night. Why is that? I kinda have a soft spot for angels like yourself. Well, I kind of have a thing for handsome devils like yourself. So, did I get to see the devil in Miss Lynn last night? What do you think? So, how does a little breakfast sound like, huh? Sounds perfect. I like this painting. Got it from my aunt over in El Reno. Reno? Like horses, hey? Yeah, I guess I could say that. Hey, hey. Everything all right? Yeah. So, why don't you make yourself at home, I'll go get some breakfast. Okay. Where does miss Lynn come from? I'm from Sacramento actually. Cali girl, hey? Yep. It's funny. I always wanted to go to California. You've never been? Never. You know one day if I make enough money. Well, one day I'll take you. Yeah, sounds like a plan. So, where are you from, Zane? Well, I'm an army brat. My dad is actually an army preacher and we moved a lot. So, I guess you can say I don't really have home town. That's kind of funny actually. How so? Well, I just wouldn't have pegged you for a preacher's son. Well, I guess you can say I've lost my way. Or maybe you just haven't found it yet. Hey, I hope you are right there, Miss Lynn. So, how did you end up here? Well, it was kind of a toss up between El Reno and Sparks, I flipped a coin and you can guess the rest of the story. So, you left it up to chance, hey? Yeah. No. I actually had the time on my own. Couldn't afford a bus ticket to Los Angeles, so ended up here. And what may I ask do you do for a living, Mr Zane? I work at this new lounge that just opened up, Horseshoe lounge. Horseshoe, eh? Yeah, I work the bar. Do some security work. - So, you work late nights? - Yeah. And I also own a small side business. And what's that about? Well... ...I have a little candy shop that caters to the citizens here in Sparks. And what kind of candy do you keep in your candy shop? Would you like to try some, little girl? Only if it's sweet. A bit early in the morning. But trust me. This is the sweetest candy you'll ever have. Zane, I don't... I don't think I can. Come on, try it, you'll like it. I've never done this kind of candy before. Hey, come on. What's that? Nothing really, just always wanted to see the Ocean. That makes the two of us actually. Never been? Never. My mom nearly drowned as a kid and she swore she'd never take us back. Hey, one day. So, how is your mom? She's not well actually. She had a nervous breakdown when my dad passed away and... ...she's under a lot of medication. Well, it's a long sad story. Hey, you'll be all right. Well, yeah, I just prefer not to talk about it, you know. Yeah, I hear ya... Hi Alex... how are things here? Finding some rest. Good? Yeah. Def... Yeah, a lot of people winning, screaming, you know All the same, the usual. The usual. The usual. All right, see you around. All right. How ya doing? Pretty good? Just waiting to get paid. What did you do? Hit a jackpot? A small one. Yeah, that is a small one, but it's nice. Thanks Samuel, how are you doing? Hi how are you doing this evening? Hi, how are you? I'm good, how is everything going? Great, thank you. Let me know if you need anything. I sure will, darling, you have a good evening. So, got a plan for you, Chloe. Oh yeah? And what's that? Well, you got a job offer if you are interested. I'm interested. It's with a place I work at, a couple of cocktail waitresses have recently left the club. Moving on to greener pastures, I guess. And Morris, the owner, is looking for some fresh faces to fill in his roster. So, I told him that I stumbled across this fairy that... ...landed on my lap the other night at the bar, and... Well, that's when I dropped your name. What's the pay like? It's okay for the job and... It would be nice if we were a two-income household now... ...since business is, well, a little slow right now. Hey, what do you think? I think that's a great idea. Let's cheers to that. So, how did it go? Took me to the cleaners on this one. That new club better start paying some of its bills. This might have been a gamble I wasn't exactly expecting. I thought business was good. It is. It can always be better. And that dealer kid... Charlie. Charlie, yeah... little fucker. Stealing all that cash last month really put a crimp in my ass. You know, I never had a good feeling about him. He was always so nervous, shifty. Well, he was good at his job. Well... I just didn't see that one coming. That's what you got me for, remember? Yeah. Which reminds me, this new kid of yours... Zane, can't be trusted either. I'd keep an eye on him and his girlfriend. Oh, come on Bruno, he's a good kid, he reminds me of my son. Yeah, but there is something else going on with him, I don't know what it is yet. But my gut tells me he's hiding something. I can see it in his eyes. Well then, you see something I don't. Don't worry about it. I got your back on this, boss. All right, well, let's go over here to Salles and grab a bite. Sounds good to me. So how much money did you win? The question is how much money did I lose? I thought you said the question was how much money did you win, so what did you win? Five bucks. So, how much did you lose? 20. Shit, take it to the bank. I will. So, did you take care of those girls for me? I did, I did. You did? Yes, no more problem with that. I had a little problem at the bar tonight. What? I had to fire Vanessa. Why? Giving away free drinks again. Shit! Bruno? Me, Morris. Yeah, I know. Hey, I wanna know why those receipts are all fucked up at the Horseshoe again. Then I'm gonna have Johnny boy and the crew... ...go over and take a little visit to Steve. Because he hasn't made good on one fucking dime. All right. Hey! Guys, I don't have any money. Yeah, you look broke. Almost. We saw you at a casino, didn't look you were doing too well there either. No, I had a bad night, I bled a little more money than usual. Well, we know that, that's why we are here to help. I don't need help. Hey, listen. My brother said we are here to help. No, really, I don't need help. Just hear us out. Open up, Zane! I know you're in there, man. Lights are on. Come on, Zane! Open the door, man. Come on Zane, let's go, no games. Let's go Zane, I don't want to play this game! See you soon. See you tomorrow, man. Hey, Zane you had visitors the other day. Really? Yeah, a couple of guys with black beanies. They looked kind of scary, are they friends of yours? No. Well, who are they? Something I don't need to deal with right now. Listen Chloe, steer clear from those two until I figure something out, okay? Morning, Bruno. So, how are things today? Morning, Boss. Okay, just surfing the net. Well, can I have my seat please?! Whoa!!! What flew up your ass today? Not a goddamn thing. Couldn't sleep a wink last night. And I got a fucking hangover, you just can't believe. Had a little blonde last night that wouldn't let me sleep a wink. You know what I'm saying? Son of a bitch. So, you want a drink? It's early! What the hell... sure! Ya know I think I may have just found something that will brighten your day. Godamn it Bruno! It better be good. Because the last Godamn time you found something on the Internet, all it was was your fucking porn. Yep... but this time... Its different. What the fuck?! What the fuck Bruno is this?! Just one of those smutty little sites that you love so much. Fuck you. Well... Our sweet little Chloe... ...has a side of her that... ...we haven't seen before. Mr Zane, just the guy we were looking for. Why don't you take a little walk with us? Zane? Zane? Oh, my God, Zane? Zane, what did they do to you? I got whooped, Chloe. The beanie brothers are getting impatient. Oh baby, that looks really deep, we need to get you to hospital. I can't do that right now. What do you mean? I just can't. Okay baby, I'm gonna go and get us some towels, okay? You just stay right there, okay? You just stay right there. What are you going to do now? I'll figure it out. Are you sure you are all right? Hey babe, can you get me my painkillers? They are in the medicine cabinet. Yeah. Where? Behind the mouthwash bottle. What can I do for you, Zane? Morris, I need to borrow some money. For what? I got in deep with the Beanie brothers. So, you are telling me you got in deep with the Beanie brothers... ...and now you are coming to me to clean up your mess? Yeah, Morris, you are the only one I know I can turn to. Come on, you know I'm good for it. You are a funny guy, Zane, and you got some funny habits. Listen, you can take it out off Chloe's tips and I'll work double shifts. Anything, Morris please, it's real urgent! I think I have an idea. Now you listen to me good, Zane. You're gonna work double shifts... ...until the money is paid back, that's without saying. Chloe. Does she do favours? What do you mean favours? You heard me. Does she or doesn't she do favours? Like what? Oh, Zane. Chloe is a pretty little thing. But she's got another side. Hey, what are you talking about, Morris? You don't have to act like you don't know what the hell I'm talking about. You've got to know. You really don't know? Oh, fuck. Well... take a look at this. Little Miss Chloe is as naughty as they get. You are a lucky boy, Zane. I can't believe it. You know, Zane, men like me... we like to dip into the fountain of youth from time to time. You know what I'm saying, don't you? No, Morris, I don't. Look, Zane, you are in deep shit! As far as I know, you are in deeper than you normally get. Now, I'm giving you way out of your mess. And as far as I'm concerned, Miss Chloe's time is interest on the money. You need to set up some quality time between Little miss Chloe and I. Morris, I don't know, I... No. We have a deal? You either you make it happen or you don't. All right, Morris, it's a deal. Great, great! Now, if for some reason, you and Miss Chloe can't work this out together, then I guess I'm gonna have to have Johnny boy and his crew... ...come over and visit you and... ...take back my money and then some. Then I'm sure you remember how that went for Steve, right? Yes, I remember. All right, so how much do you need? 25 Gs. When do you need it by? Brothers need it by tomorrow. So, you need it right now? Yeah. Goddamn you, Zane! You promise me you will never get yourself in this deep again. Do you understand me?! I promise. Now I want you to make me some special coupons... ...for some special nights with Chloe. You can handle that, right? Zane? Zane! You can handle that right? Yes Morris, yes, I can! All right. We have a deal. There it is, 25 grand, count it. Zane? If you try to fucking bail with my money, there is going to be serious consequences. I got you, Morris, okay? Now you go and make good with the Beanie brothers. You honor your deal with me like a man. And none if this ever happened. And Zane? Tell Miss Chloe... ...I'm waiting. Where have you been all day, Zane? Out. I had to take care of some stuff. Yeah well those guys came by looking for you, asking about the money you owe them, what's that all about? Hey, you know what, that's none of your business, okay? Yeah, hell it ain't. Either way, I paid them back today. Oh, yeah? And where did you get the money to do that? Hey, what's up with all the fucking questions, okay? I told you. We got the money from selling coke, okay? I'm just saying, there is no way you could have made that much money... ...in that short amount of time. Why don't you tell me the truth? Yeah, you know what? I think it's about time we both started telling each other the truth here. What are you talking about? I stumbled across something the other day, does Heavenly Hottie ring a bell? No, Zane, it doesn't. I don't know, I don't know where you come from, Miss Mystery Girl. All I know is I saw you on some sort of a porn site. A porn site? Zane, that's fucking crazy. Look, I'll even show you! Look, look, Chloe, I'll be damned if that ain't you. No, it's not me Zane, that's my sister. Your sister? She has a mole, I don't. She died a few months ago. What?! That's why I left Heavenly Valley in the first place, I couldn't deal with her death. Chloe, Chloe, Chloe... you never told me you had a sister. Anything you want to tell me about yourself, Miss Chloe? Zane. I gotta... I gotta go. No, no, Chloe, Chloe, I need you here. Listen, Chloe. I... I'm in deep shit. I didn't get the money from selling coke, I got it from Morris. And how are you ever gonna pay him back? Listen, I'll work extra shifts and I'll... I'll try and hustle some more candy. It's gonna work, I have it, okay? God, Zane! Zane, fuck! And... ...there was another part of the deal I need to tell you about. In exchange for lending me the money... ...I promised him... You promised him what? I promised him you'd be willing to sleep with him. You shit! You pimped me out?! Now, you listen to me, Chloe. I thought that girl was you on the website that will slut up for anything. Now if it wasn't for me, your stupid little ass would still be hustling the streets still. Now don't forget who got you into their place... and don't forget who got you a job at the club to begin with. Then don't tell me that, don't tell me... You shut your mouth Chloe, you shut your mouth! No, Zane! Zane, get off me! Fuck! It's OK. Zane? Yes? I can't be Morris'. I know, I know. I'm such an ass, I can't believe I dragged you into this. But I got a plan to make it all better. And what's that? I know the combination to Morris's safe. How are we going to get to it? He'll want a vermouth and a cigar before, it's his favorite routine. I don't know, why can't we just leave now? With what money, Chloe? Think of it! It's easy. He won't expect anything from you. Slip something into his glass, get to the safe. He must have more than a 100 grand in that safe. That's more than enough for us to start fresh somewhere else. I don't know. What am I going to do? You can sell more coke, anything. No, I need to get that money back tomorrow ASAP or my time will be up. When is our first date? Hi, Zane. So, Morris really wants to go through with it tonight? Zane, are you sure that you want to go through with that? All right, are you ready? I'm late. Hey. I'll be out the back from midnight on. Call or text if things get ugly, okay? Oh, Chloe! Person I was looking to see. Hi, Morris. How are you this evening? I'm well, how about yourself? I'm great. Zane did enlighten you about our little deal, right? He sure did. Because I would like to redeem one of those coupons tonight. That is as long as you are not too busy? No, Morris, I'm not. That's great. Why don't you join me in my office? Sure, why don't I fix you a drink at the bar first? It's a marvelous idea. How about a vermouth straight up? Sure. See you in a few. Hey, Chloe. Hi, Morris. How are you doing? Doing well. We missed you last weekend at the club. I know. Yeah, the regulars, they get a little testy... ...when they don't get their usual pick of the litter. I bet. You know, honey, if you work your cards right, I'm just gonna have to make you a dancer at the new club. And you'll be making three times the money you are making right now. Because I do know talent. Well, thank you, Morris. I'm flattered. Why don't I get you your drink I made for you. Did you spill honey? That's okay, I didn't need that drink anyway. Because, you know, I knew that you had the talent... ...that every man should experience. Why don't we both get ourselves a drink? Because I don't want a drink. I don't need a drink. I am ready to experience... ...all the good things that I'm sure that you are capable of doing. So, I think we should just go on upstairs and get to know each other a little bit. Morris, I insist. Well, Chloe, I really am done with the small talk and fucking around... ...because it's time to go fuck. No, no, no, Chloe. Chloe? Babe? Wake up. Babe, wake up! Wake up! Wake up, Chloe! Come on baby, wake up Chloe! Chloe, wake up! Wake up, Chloe! Hey, babe. Wake up! Wake up, baby. Wake up, Chloe, wake up. Zane! What are you gonna do, Zane? Liliy! Not now! Where are the matches, huh? Where the fuck are my matches? Zane, the doctors said you ain't supposed to smoke in the house, remember? I don't have time for this right now. Well, then answer me, damn it. Don't tell me what to do. Why don't you listen to me? Don't you get feisty with me here, okay? I told you I don't have time for this right now. I gotta get to work. Working a double shift, we'll talk about it later. Zane? What? Do you still love me? So, what's your big problem? Morris, I need to talk to you about Chloe. What about her? She is not doing well, she is in a real bad shape. I want to strike a deal, Morris. What? I need to renegotiate. Zane, you know in my book that a deal is a deal. And when it's done, it's done. I've made a big mistake. It wasn't Chloe on the website. What are you talking about it wasn't Chloe for God's sake. I mean it just wasn't, okay? It was her sister. She died a few months ago. And I need Chloe to be out of this. That's not gonna happen, Zane. Listen, Morris, I already work double shifts for you, you can keep that out of my wages, keep my tips, I'll do anything Morris, but I need Chloe out of our deal. I don't know if we can do that, Zane. Morris, please. I brought the only thing that has value in my life. I was married once. Someone I loved very much. Zane, I don't even think it would cover half of what you owe me though. I know, but like I said I'll work off the rest. Listen, Morris, everyone deserves a second chance. All right, Zane. Oh, hell. I suppose... I suppose so. Zane... Goddamn it. If I let you off the hook on this, you have to understand, this is a one time deal. Do you understand that? Yes, Morris, I understand that. I promise I'll never get in this deep again. All right. You work off what you owe me. And when that is done, Chloe is free and clear. Goddamn it. You remind me so much of him. And I can't believe what I'm about to do. You know, Zane, I had a son once. And he looked so much like you. So much. He was killed in a car accident. I want you to take this. And I want you to take Chloe... ...and I want you guys to go and start a new life, away from here. He loved that car. That car was supposed to be... ...his 21st birthday present. He never got it, Zane. So, trust me on this one. This is my second chance. So, don't fuck it up for me, all right? Now get out of here. You take care, son.
