Pakistan's new prime minister Mr. Ashraf Ali Sultan.. ..has said that he will come to India for peace talks. Mr. Sultan, I would like to ask you a direct question. In current atmosphere, will there be a war between India and Pakistan? It is foolish to think about war. I am going to India, only with the hope for peace. With the peace conference only a few days away.. ..there again was firing at the border. And Pakistan's defence minister Mr. Parvez Mukhtar Khan.. ..has given this statement. I just want to say that Pakistan neither wants to kneel.. ..nor wants to force anyone else to kneel. But if there is any unwarranted aggravation. ..Pakistan knows how to give a fitting reply. Hello, friends. You are watching Uttejit Samachar. In today's exciting news, ..the peace conference between India and Pakistan will be held at Ahmedabad. And also, I have written a song, a rap to welcome the Pak team. Mayur, please give the beats. Start. O Pak PM, welcome sir. In the name of peace we will release doves here.

Farooq, both Murugan have come. Come in. Come in. Come. One name but two men. Oh, this reminds me of the dialogue from Sholay. One bullet and 3 men. It is a great injustice. Quiet! - He is saying to keep quiet. My God. He speaks exactly like Shatrughan Sinha. Quiet! By the way do you have Sonakshi? Please keep quiet Look, I am Murugan. This is my son. I mean he is papa Murugan. I am son Murugan. Masha Allah (Praise the Lord) Masha Allah (Praise the Lord) No, no, not Massa (Uncle) - Papa. Yes, uncle lives in Bhavnagar.

Okay. 3 crores (30 million) 3 crores! - This is just the advance. The remaining 7 crores, after the job gets done. 7 crores!! But (Magar) the job should be done as promised. 'Magar' you mean we have to catch a Magar (crocodile) He means to say that the job should be done as promised. Consider it as done. - Just a minute. Tell me one thing. - What? If you are Murugan, how can you be Gujarati? Brother Farooq, for the first time you have said something intelligent. Nice. This Murugan is really troubling us I mean everybody asks me the same question. The thing is.. Your turn. - Me? We..we are Gujarati Murugan. What do you mean? I mean.. - Your turn. You see, there is a very long love story behind my name. So lets forget it. - Yes. Love story! We are very fond of love stories. Let's hear it Do you want to hear it? Ok if you insist on going down that path, then listen. Now the story behind this is.. Magaldas was my father's name His father's name was... Khushaldas.. Is Khushaldas okay for you? - Yes we have no objection. It so happened that Khushaldas went to Vishkhapatnam.. ..to expand his business. Right? Where did he go? - Vishakhapatnam. Very good. There he met Shashikala Mani ratnam Murugan. Now my Grandfather and Shahikala.. That happened between them. You understood right? My grandfather was of 'that' type. So that happened between them.. So Shashikala said that since that has happened.. Let us do that as well Did you understand? What happened? - That 'that' happened Psst, that never happened You haven't understood what 'that' happened. - Yes What do you mean 'that' happened? How can you say something like that about my grandfather? No, no, I will tell you. Actually, 'that' happened Yes. - Correct. You understood perfectly. He is following properly. This one doesn't pay attention. - What you.. So that is what happened I mean love happened between them. Do you people fall in love? Love happened between the two.. ..so they decided 'lets get married' But then Venkatesh, was against it. You figured it out right? He was Shashikala's stepbrother. You are following me? Who fell in love? Vishakhapatnam. - Oh, God. Just throw him out. Vishakhapatnam is the name of a place. How can place fall in love? I apologize on his behalf. My grandfather's name was Adidas. - Khushaldas. You don't add you're two cents. I think you'll are confused. Let me explain this in another way Pass that here. Now pay close attention. - Okay. I won't keep repeating myself. - Okay. Now assume this pomegranate is my grandfather.. ..and this orange is my grandmother. Okay? These two fell in love. They decided to get married. Now who is the main villain here? Sapota. Tell me who is Sapota? Their daughter. - What daughter, daughter? You want a daughter before marriage? You will spoil my family's name. He is an idiot. Sapota means brother. The stepbrother. What name did we give him? - Venkatesh. See, he is listening carefully. Thanks. So Venkatesh objected to their marriage.. ..but everybody said Now that love has blossomed They must get married. So these are Shashikala's 4 uncles. They came and blessed them. And these grapes they were her aunts. They told Shahikala, you get married and live happily ever after with Khusaldas. Then my grandfather said.. ..'Shashi, if you want to continue using your surname..' '..you can do so.' That is how we became Murugan. They got married. If you want to give a wedding gift, now is the time. No, no. - No, no. You're story is very interesting. I'm glad you believed it. But what do we have to do? For you'll it's a very simple job. You just have to bring Malaika to us. Malaika? From where do we have to bring her? Our boss will tell us the location tonight. Brother Farooq, let us take a selfie on this note. - Of course. Yes, yes, come. - Come. Come. See, we sent it to our boss also Now tell us when do we have to do the job? Tomorrow morning. Tomorrow? Oh shit, you made a blunder.. Tomorrow we have to go to Pindasar Civil Hospital with my wife and mother-in-law. Since Dad is busy tomorrow I'll go by myself to meet Malaika No, that is not necessary. What I'll do is drop those two first.. Then the two of us will go to get Malaika. Wonderful. Both of you are daredevils. Wow you called us daredevils. Well, bros, by the way who is this Malaika? A gift. A wonderful gift. For India. From Lashkar-E-Jihad. Lashkar-E-Ji.. Lashkar-E-Jihad? Terrorist group? Yes. Now no one can stop Mission One Way Mission One Way? Well Ok, mister, now we will pass away. Okay, okay. I mean we will take the bypass - Okay, okay. What? I mean, let's not pass time, we will take you're leave. I am starting to feel sleepy. - Me too, all of a sudden, sleepy. Okay, we are leaving. Ok come. What happened? Advance. The rest of it after the job gets done. Well, since you insist we will keep it. Okay, bye. - Bye. Come. Let's go. We are in big trouble, Khagiya. KD. - Shut up. Shahrukh - Farooq are terrorists. Yes, and Murugan is working for these terrorists. And you're Priya is working for Murugan.. ..and you thought she was honorable. No, No, Pappa. - Shut up Pappa, Listen, listen, please listen to me. The poor girl might be under some compulsion. Nonsense compulsion? Now we are caught up in this mess. I have got an idea. - Tell me quickly. I will take grandmom and mummy to Bhupat uncle. Okay - And you handle these people What do you mean by I should handle these people? There is only one way out now We'll hire a taxi and get the hell out of here Come - Hey, wait , wait, hold on a minute Listen. What about this bag? It belongs to us now. This is what is meant by, There is no limit to God's benevolence. Now let's get out of here. Run "My stole flies away when I drape it." It was fun. - Oh, my God. There they are. "My stole flies away when I drape it." "My stole flies away when I drape it." "My stole flies away when I drape it." "My stole flies away when I drape it." "My stole.." "My stole.."

Do you know what sort of a blunder you have committed? Yes, yes. I am about 95% aware Your turn. And the remaining 5% also is his fault. Shoot him if you wish, but let me go. - No. we'll die.. Listen, Mr. Murugan, we took pity on you and brought you here.. ..is this the way to repay our kindness? I won't spare you. Hands up. Wow. She is amazing. Put that gun down, Priya Rajguru. How do you know my name? Who are you? My name is Murugan. I'm your senior. You're lying. He is Murugan and I have verified his digital ID. How can it be possible? Er.. Dad had used you're fingerprint to verify Keep quiet. Priya, I'm Vikrant Waghmare. You can call up Rizwan Sir and confirm my ID if you want to Sir, you may talk to Rizwan or Bhagwan (God).. ..but please let us go. Let us go. - Stop. Priya. - Sir. I think these guys are double agents Yes, sir, that's true. We are agents. I mean we are estate agents. - Yes. Give them our business card. I don't have the card on me - Idiot, you never carry the card. How will we ever expand our business like this? - But.. Sir, I will tell you. There is a 2 Bedroom scheme at Ghatlodia. 30% advance payment and the rest.. - Shut up! Pappa, stop fooling around and tell him the truth. Okay. Listen, Mr. Sankrant.. - Vikrant. Sorry, Mr. Vikrant. I will tell you everything truthfully. Sir, we didn't know that such huge problem would be created .. ..by just using the name Murugan for one night. You idiots. The entire mission has failed because of you Whose admission, sir? Not admission, mission. Mr. Divetia, we are working for India's topmost secret agency.. ..RAW, Research and Analysis Wing's special branch. Really? - Yes. Priya, I will have to call up headquarters right now.. ..and abort this mission immediately. Ok then we'll take you're leave. Come. - Sit Down! Put the moneybag down. No, sir, we can't do that. Murugan was the only link to get to Lashkar-E-Jihad. I know, sir, but these two met Farooq and Shahrukh as Murugan. Yes. We also took a selfie. - Shut up! Sir, the terrorists trust these two. So let these two do the job which you were supposed to do as Murugan What? Are you out of your mind? You think these jokers can do my job? Sir, once these two find out their plan then we can take over. Look, sister, till date None of our plans have succeeded. If you wish we will go and apologize to the terrorists. We'll ask for forgiveness Sir, instead of letting the entire mission fail.. ..it will be better that we take this chance. We have no other option. If we look at it from a different perspective, We could make this change in plans work to our advantage. Sir, if you want to extract information, then send my mother-in-law I can't even get my wife to confide in me. ..how will I get the terrorists to.. You don't have a choice If you don't agree, I can get you arrested. - What? This is a matter of our country's security ..and we don't have much time. And mind you.. ..do not breath a word about this mission to anyone No. - Neither to your wife nor to your girlfriend.. I don't have a girlfriend.. ..but I might find one if I do this mission. Consider this as an opportunity to serve your country Priya, I am ready to do this mission for you, I mean for our country. Yes, we are ready. All right. So from today, from this very moment you are.. ..Spies for the topmost secret agency of our country. All the best. Khagiya, this time we're really trapped. Don't worry, when the world sees us in action, they will be stunned! - Stunned.. "Gujjubhai is swinging." Hey, guys and dear girls, this is KD. Well, for a few days I won't be able to meet you.. ..because I will be going on a secret mission. Because I have licence to kill. Till then you have licence to chill. So, keep watching and keep missing KD's Kitli. Hey, idiot, close your Kitli and quickly pack you're clothes. We have to leave immediately. Oh, yes, yes, yes. The secret mission must not be delayed.

By the way do you'll have pani puri in Pakistan or not? Let it be.. Then there is no point living in this country. Tell me more. - Yeah I am getting to that. You know what I did, I picked up the Water (gravy) of the pani-puri vendor ..and threw the spicy masala water on the Russians like this. And the Russians became like this. And my wife was even more cunning than me. She turned around And picked up piping hot lumps of vegetable curry.. ..and threw them at the Russians. And the Russian spies cried Oh mommy! Oh mommy! And ran away. That is how the proverb.. ..'Whatever is in you're hand is a weapon' came to be invented. Yes. - That's all for now. How did you like it? I don't know. I couldn't understand much.

We are just idiots. We won't breath a word to anybody I swear on my mother's life. Even if you tell, it won't make a difference. All the information in the file you have uploaded is false! We wanted that file to reach Priya. The preparation for Operation One Way has been going on.. ..since past 6 months. I had called up Rizwan sir from Doha.. ..and given him information about Farooq Shahrukh. My plan was to carry out the mission under the guise of Murugan. But you father-son messed it up. Because of you, I had to change my plan. No, sir, there will be no compromise in the mission. Whatever will happen, will be in our best interest. Welcome, Mr. Divetia. It was I who had informed the BSF, so as to eliminate you in Kutchh But you escaped from there as well. Then I make a new plan. The purpose behind kidnapping and bringing you here.. .. was to fool the Indian intelligence service. By uploading the files, you've done just that. At tomorrow's peace conference.. ..the Prime Ministers of both the countries will meet. But before they sign the peace treaty.. ..there will be an explosion And the Prime Minister will die You mean, you are going to kill our Prime Minister? No, no, no. Pakistan's Prime Minister Ashraf Ali Sultan will die. What? No one will ever imagine that the peace loving Ashraf Ali ..was killed by his own people. And whole world will blame India. But how will you prove that India is responsible.. ..for the death of Pakistan's Prime Minister? Gentlemen, I only have to say is that.. ..We had gone to India hoping for peace But India betrayed us. We will attack India to avenge our Prime Minister's murder Waghmare. - Yes. You will go across the border with Malaika I will go to India with the Prime Minister.. ..and as for you two. You will meet the almighty. What? Wagh uncle! Defense uncle! We won't say anything to anybody! Uncle, please let us go! Yunus bhai, what I am saying is, now that they have gone, please untie our hands I won't do anything. I am like your son. You dimwit. I am much younger than you, understand? Sorry. Please let us go. If you wish we will leave Ahmedabad.. ..and go somewhere far away like New Zealand or Switzerland. What New Zealand and Switzerland. You have a rich father? Keep it something local. We will go to Nagaland. - Yes. What is this? I will cut your fingers with this. Forget my fingers. Cut his fingers. He has been given tetanus injections - Dad! Yunus bhai, Malaika madam has asked for that box Oh, God. Pappa, he has gone out Pappa, let us .. Pappa, let us do something quickly - He will come back Pappa, let's move our chairs closer Why are you laughing? You are tickling me. I think we are destined to die. Pappa, please try at least - That guy will come back any moment No one will come. Just try. It has loosened. Wait. Keep that American spy tied up. I'll be there in a bit He has come. Pappa, release the dart You scoundrels.. Dad release the other dart. Let's get the hell out of here! - But how? This place is crawling with terrorists. I have an Idea What? "They will fight. They will fall." "They will die. The angels." Cover the face. Not his, you idiot, yours. "O my friends, this is the last war." "Show everybody there is a bomb in this hand," "None of your enemies should survive." "Show him your mettle." "Make a loud explosion. The world will watch." "Take it. Take it. Take my life." "Take it. Take it. Take my.." 'Dialed number is switched off.' Take this file to the cyber cell. Sharma, contact the defense secretary. "Soldiers, use your full strength." "Now this was will be till death." "The victory song.." "The victory song is boom, boom." "Take it. Take it. Take my life." "Take it. Take it. Take my life." The ATS commandos have taken their positions. Now, before the terrorist attack takes place.. We will capture them, and I hope The meet with Pakistan Goes through smoothly, without any complications. Sir, this is my responsibility I will personally look into every detail. Okay. - Don't worry, sir. Everything will happen as planned. Sir, excuse me. Hello - It's me How many times have I told you not to call up on this number? I called up because it is important. 'What happened?' The father and son have escaped. What? - 'Yes.' And I think they have gone towards India. Okay, I will think of something. Vikrant. - Yes? Is everything all right? Sir, actually I have received some sensitive information. What? Sir, two terrorists of Lashkar-E-Jihad have slipped into India.. ..through the Kutch border. We have just received information.. ..that two terrorists from Lashkar-E-Jihad.. have infiltrated India. Both the terrorists are linked with the sleeper cell in Ahmedabad. Did you hear? There is a sleeper cell in Ahmedabad. I have completely lost my sleep. The secret service has announced a red alert.. And the Partner of the terrorists, has been taken into custody. Mr. Nagda, you are Divetia's contractor. What had he contracted you for? Tell me. Sir, I had no idea even in my dreams.. ..that he will use my money for terrorist activities. Contact us immediately if you get any information about them. This boy was following me. When is Holi?
