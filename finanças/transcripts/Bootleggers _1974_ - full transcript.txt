He said them Woodalls is pretty head up about that last trip you took over there. - Pa, Memphis is just too big for them Woodalls to have all of themselves. - How many eggs you want this morning, Othar, one or two? - Can I have three, grandma? - I declare, boy, you're high as a beet tree. - [Silas] Well I ain't worried about 'em none. Taking care of myself. - Look, we ain't had no problem with 'em for several years, but just the minute that you go peddlin' whiskey over yonder in Memphis, you're gonna hear from 'em and right now. - Already took a couple of loads over and I ain't heard from 'em yet. You're gettin' old, Pa, you worry too much. - Let me tell you somethin', boy. I been in more bootleg whiskey fights than you got teeth in your head. The only reason I'm a-sittin' right here right now is because I never took none of 'em like it. - Son, you got a hole in there, them old drawers.

Man can't grow nothin' here but, well maybe a little hay. God, I love this country. (dramatic music) But Daddy tried to make a livin' here. His daddy before him. I starved us to death. So son, that's why we're bootleggers. Come on. Let's go. (dramatic music) You know, boy, I guess I was just about your age when my pappy started to teach me how to run a still. It was right back over yonder in them hills. Not too far from here. - [Othar] Grandpa, would you teach me how to run the still? - [Grandpa] Yeah, reckon I will, boy. Come Saturday morning I'll take you up there. (upbeat western music) - [Othar] Ready, Grandpa? - [Grandpa] Just keep your shirt on, boy. (upbeat western music) - [Othar] Come on, Grandpa. - You know, son, that still's been there for right on to 60 years and I reckon it'll be there when we get there. Take off, I'll be behind ya. - Come on, Grandpa. (upbeat western music) Where is it, Grandpa? - Right on down yonder, boy. (upbeat western music) Be careful. Careful of falling. Slip and fall down and you'll bust yourself. (dramatic music) And there she is, the best still on the Buffalo River. - Wow, Grandpa. - Don't go runnin' off down there 'til I get us a light lit. (upbeat western music) This is it. First thing we gotta do is get a fire going. (upbeat western music) Mmm, it smells good. Hand me me that jar of dough. Yeah, she's a-cookin' real good. Here boy, come get your bucket a-water on it. Hurry up. (upbeat western music) (water splashing) Look at that, we're makin' whiskey, boy.

(dramatic music) - [Sheriff] Evening, Dewey. - [Dewey] Evening, Sheriff. - [Sheriff] Still alright, Othar? - Just fine, Sheriff, thank you. - [Sheriff] You boys know it's against the law to run from an officer? Call it resisting arrest. - Never would've run from you Sheriff, if I'd knowed it was you. - Well now just who'd you think it was with a siren goin'? - Some of them Woodall boys. - That's what we figured, Sheriff. 'Cause the other night we got stopped by a car with a big sirene, figured it was y'all. I'd likely got my head blowed off. Just a bunch of sneaky Woodalls. - Mighty interesting story, Dewey. I don't suppose you bothered to report it? - No sir, didn't want to cause no trouble. - [Sheriff] Mighty thoughtful of you, Dewey. - They must've got rid of it Sheriff, this is the only thing I could find except some tools. - What are the jars for, boys? - Grandma's puttin' up some preserves, Sheriff. - Gee, they're for her. - If you don't believe us you can ask her yourself. - I want you to go down there and check the road on both sides, all the way back to the Y. Alright, you boys can just settle yourself down 'cause we're gonna be here awhile. (dramatic music music) (car engine rumbling) (harmonica music) (car engine rumbling) - [Carl] I looked everywhere Sheriff, nothing. - Mind if I go Sheriff? Grandma'll be wonderin' what happened to us. - 'Cause she's pickin' us along pourin' out them fruit jars. - Don't get antsy. I can still take ya in, you know, for resistin' arrest. - Do what you want, Sheriff, you're the law. - Alright, go ahead, get out of my sight. - Thanks, Sheriff. - Let me tell you something, boys. Next time it's gonna go hard on you. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - I believe I'll wait 'til you pull out before I get in. (car engine rumbling) (lively banjo music) - Hold it! Both of you boys are slick, there ain't no doubt about it. We know you picked up a load down the river. I'd just like to know, personal, what'd you do with it? Now this ain't the law talking. - Think we oughta tell him, Dewey? - Sure. - Now you ain't gonna hold it against us if we tell ya. - Well, you got my word on it. - Well if you gotta know, Sheriff, we drank it. (laughing) (upbeat western music) They ain't still following us, are they? (laughing) - Don't see no sign of 'em. - Okay let's stop off at Bobskin Creek. (upbeat western music) (whiskey pouring) - We drunk it. (laughing) (distant laughing) - So you boys say this is good stuff? - You wanna try it? - Sure smells good to me. - Hold on a sec, Bubba. Dewey, get a Coke. - [Dewey] Right. (coughing) - Come on, Bubba. - That is the best. - [Dewey] Hot dog, . (upbeat western music) - [Man] Come on you can do it again.

(upbeat western music) (distant cheering and clapping) (upbeat western music) Well I believe I'll get out there and dance. - Just don't step on anybody with them big feet of yours. - Wait'll you see me boogie. (laughing) Hey, did you see that? - Huh? - [Dewey] That girl over there, she's smilin' right at me. (upbeat western music) - How do you know she's smiling at you? - 'Cause she's smilin' right at me. - Well what are you gonna do about it? - Well I believe I'll ask her to dance. (throat clearing) (upbeat western music) - [Man] What're you doing dancing? (upbeat western music) Damn! - What's the matter? - Aw, reckon it's his wife. (laughing) - [Woman] You acted like a real gentleman. Good ole boy, he's just drunk. - Ma'am, is that Bobby Joe Woodall's wife? - [Woman] Wife, he doesn't have a wife. He just chases every girl in town. - You come to a dance with me, you stay with me. Do you understand? - Well, I believe I'm gonna ask her to dance again. - Dewey. - Excuse me, ma'am. Would you like to try that dance again? - You're one of them Pruitt bunch ain't ya? - No my name is Crenshaw, Dewey Crenshaw. My grandpa's name is Pruitt. - Yeah, well that makes a lotta sense. You see anybody dance with a Pruitt just as soon dance with hill trash. (upbeat western music) (thumping) (frenzied chattering) (screaming) (suspenseful music) - [Woman] Don't do that! (suspenseful music) - Dewey. Excuse me, Dewey don't got no knife. But I'll be glad to accommodate you. - Make no difference to me. I'd just as soon kill on Pruitt as another. (screaming) (suspenseful music) (screaming) - [Woman] Don't do that, don't do that. (thudding) (screaming) - You hurt him, you hurt him bad. - I'm gonna let you take all the credit for that, ma'am. - Hey Othar, where'd you learn that? Some kind of new jiu-jitsu? - We'll talk about this later, now get in. (suspenseful music) (dog barking) - [Grandma] Herman? Who could that be? - You stay in bed, Mama, I'll see who it is. (dog barking) - Mr. Pruitt? - Yeah! I'll be there in a minute. - Mr. Pruitt? Mr. Pruitt. - [Grandpa] Yeah, I'll be with ya in a minute. What can I do for ya? - [Homer] I'd like to talk with you. My name's Homer Dodd. - Blue! Get back under the porch. Shut up, there. - The dogs won't bite, will they? - Ah, he makes a lot of racket but he's harmless. Come on up, boy. - Mr. Pruitt I know your grandson Othar and I haven't seen him in a while but he told me if I was ever out this way and needed a drink I could come by and get one. - Which one of the Dodd boys did you say you was? - I'm Homer, Jesse's youngest. - How much liquor do you want? - What do you get on a pint? - [Grandpa] 45 cents. - [Homer] That'll be okay I'll take it. - Alright you wait here I'll get it for you. (dog growling) Here you are son. - Thank you sir. Pruitt, I've heard some talk up in town about that the Woodalls might try to stop Othar and Dewey the next time they go over in Memphis. I believe it's about that trouble that they had at the dance the other night. - Well now boy, I sure do appreciate you coming by here and telling me this. I know that Othar will sure appreciate it. - Oh let's see how much did you say this was? - Oh that's alright son you don't owe me nothing. Just take that liquor and just enjoy it in good health. - Yes sir, thank you sir, mighty kind. - You come back you hear? - Hold on second, now hold it there. We might, have to check the drain plug on the other side there. - I want to talk to you boys. - Just a minute Grandad. - How much will that tank hold? - It holds 50 gallons. Got her? - That's just about it. Whoa look at this Grandpa she's tighter than a glover. - You boys gotta be careful, too much whiskey in there and these rough roads, you hit something that tank would explode, she'd go up like a bomb. Got something else on my mind. This man McClusky drove over from Memphis yesterday. We had a talk. He wants to buy 50 gallons of Buffalo River Pride a month. Says he'll give us a dollar a gallon more than we're gettin'. (shouting with excitement) - [Dewey] Shoot Othar. - Just hold your horses son. I told him we'd think it over and let him know. - What's to think on Grandad? - Well for one thing I suspect that if we sell him 50 gallons a month why that's gonna mean 50 gallons less that the Woodalls is gonna sell. - That don't bother us. The fact is it makes Othar and I just downright happy. - Well if we take that order it could cause some trouble. - [Dewey] Well that still don't bother us. - Well I'll tell you something that will bother you son. That youngest boy of Mr. Dodd's dropped by the house last night. Said that them Woodalls might not just let you boys go down into Memphis. Said they're kind upset about the way you whooped Bobby Joe at the dance the other night. - Well that don't bother us Grandpa, we can handle it. - Well I was just telling ya. Now you boys take care of yourselves do you understand? - Grandad, I reckon you're probably right. You know something I don't mean this to sound disrespectful, but I've been looking forward to it, I've been looking forward to it for a long time. (laughing) (dramatic music) - Well anyhow I told ya. (groaning) - How come you'd do that? What's wrong? - I don't know. - Nothing seems wrong to me. - Me neither. Something ain't right. - [Dewey] Let's get a little closer. (suspenseful music) (whistling) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) - Get down! (guns firing) (suspenseful music) - Back it up Othar back it up, keep going, keep going. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) - [Othar] How are we doing? - [Dewey] Go right, go right. (glass shattering) - You alright? - Dang, yeah. (suspenseful music) (guns firing) - Keep them off Dewey. - Keep going, move. Come on keep going, back it up! (suspenseful music) (splashing) (suspenseful music) - [Othar] We've gotta get out of here. Dewey when I stop you jump alright? - [Dewey] Alright. - [Othar] Now. - Let's go. (suspenseful music) (explosion booming) (horn honking) - 30 seconds, start talking before I blow your brains out. - Believe me I haven't got a thing to do with this. Man gave me three dollars, told me to cross the bridge. - Don't kill him Othar he don't know nothing. - That's a nice pair of mules Mister. You take them mules and you get. Get out of here. - Yes sir, thank you. Go on get out of here, get. (laughing) - You know that Sheriff's gonna swallow his wad of tobacco when he sees this little jewel fly by. (laughing) - Well if we're gonna be able to keep the jewel Dewey you're gonna have to start shooting better than you did the other day. - Boy she's a beauty ain't she? - Come on Dewey. Come on Dewey. (gun firing) - Did I get it? - You almost got it that time Dewey. Let me try it this time, you watch. Any time Dewey. (gun firing) - Damn! I don't know how you do it, you don't even take aim. - Sometime there ain't no time to aim Dewey. - Boy I wish I had one of those guns like that old boy Al Capone then I wouldn't need to aim. Boy I'd just. (mimicking gun firing) Boy I'd have Woodalls spread all over this field. - Dewey, just keep practicing. And don't shoot yourself. - You know you're gonna be sorry for all them nasty things you said about me when I get to be known as dead eye Dewey, America's most fearsome gunman. (gun firing) - [Othar] Ya get it that time Dewey? - Yeah I believe I did, believe I got it. (goofy music) (cows mooing) - Give me some help. Just as worthless as Bobby Joe. What the hell you reckon happened to Bobby Joe? Ought to have been back from Memphis two hours ago. - Maybe he had some car trouble Pa. - He ain't had no car troubles. I'll tell you where he's at. It's that little old redhead in Memphis. - Here he comes down the road now Pa. - What the hell's wrong with you boy? Look at that radiator boiling over. These damn cars cost money. - He wouldn't take our liquor Pa. - What do you mean he wouldn't take it? He has to take it, we gotta deal. - Old man McClusky, he tasted it and he said his deal was for prime whiskey and that ours was nothing but rotgut and he wouldn't take it and that's what he told me to tell you. - I'll rip him apart. - Maybe we used to much lye to make the batch-- (thumping) (groaning) I wish you wouldn't do that Pa! - You shut your mouth boy and speak when you're spoken to you hear? - Well I ain't done nothing. - Hey Pa what about this load? You want me to run it down to Hot Springs and try to sell it to those gamblers? You know when they get drunk they'll drink anything. - McClusky needed that liquor. If he didn't like the way it tasted all he had to did was put some flavorin' in it. No, there's something else going on. - Well he did say something about him being mad at us about all that trouble killing them Thorton boys and the scrap with the Pruitts. - We should've handled that ourselves. - And also, he said not only won't he take this load but that he don't need none for a couple of months. - He's lying! I'll deal with McClusky on my own. (majestic music) (harmonica music) - What's a matter Dewey you cold? - [Dewey] Yeah I'm cold. Sure don't feel like working today. You know if we're gonna make 50 gallon more a month we're gonna need a lot more corn chops. - Yup. I already ordered another four bushels of chop this week. - You did? - Yep. - Looks like that cornmeal's about ready to be cooked. - No it'll be about another 12 hours. - 12 hours? - Yep. - [Othar] Better mix up some new batches. - Yeah. Dang it. - What'd you forget? - Nothing I just, I just set some rabbit traps across the river and I just plain forgot about them. (laughing) - I know what you're driving at Dewey. Go on check 'em. - Thanks Othar. I'll be back in just a bit. - And I didn't have anybody else coming in. - Don't worry. (laughing) - Yeah I'm sure. - Oh look at that water. (gasping) Doesn't that look great? - Sure does. - Can't wait to get in. - Say are you real busy this afternoon or could we spend some time here? - Oh I got maybe one girl. Oh does that feel good. - Tell me about how good that feels. (gasping) (gun firing) (screaming) (gun firing) - Sally Fannie you can shoot as good as a man. - If you'd grown up among the boys I did you'd have learned to shoot to. You'd of had to. Let's go on in girls. (upbeat western music) (sensuous music) (laughing) Let's go on in. (upbeat western music) Come on you all, hurry. - We're coming. (laughing) (chattering) (laughing) (chattering) (laughing) (upbeat western music) (chattering) - [Woman] Did you see that little fish? - Othar! Othar! Othar come quick come on. - What's wrong Dewey? - You don't need your gun. Whole dang river's full of naked women. Come on. (upbeat western music) (laughing) Boy they're something ain't they? - I can't see nothing from here Dewey. I can't see nothing from here. - Let's get a little closer. (suspenseful music) - Ready? (laughing) Othar, there's a clothes over there. Let's steal them. - Naw I don't think we ought to do that Dewey. - Ah gee, you just don't want to have no fun at all no more. That's naked women out there. (shushing) - Sally I think we got a couple of peeping toms behind them rocks over there. - I know, I've been watching them. (laughing) - Alright but we gotta be quiet. - Okay. (suspenseful music) (laughing) (gun firing) - Hey! - Damn. - [Sally] Alright hold it. - Now turn around and get your hands up. - Better do what she says Dewey, she can shoot. - I said turn around. Just keep turning that head around buster and I'm gonna shoot off the end of your nose. - Well would you look at this one. - He sure is puny. Maybe we ought to let him go. - I don't know what's wrong with you girls we're just walking down here real peaceful like and you start shooting at us. - Listen here, you just shut up. I'll do the talking. You think it's such a big joke to steal girl's clothes? Well we'll just see how you like it. Now turn around and start undressing. - You gotta be joking. - You open that mouth again and you're gonna find out if I am joking. Now get out of them clothes. I mean it. (suspenseful music) (gasping) Bundle up their clothes girls. - Hey now wait a minute where are you all going with our clothes? You can't just go off like that. - Oh, well if you want your clothes back I'll tell you where you can find them. Come to Bea's Beauty Parlor in Calico Rocks, bye now. (whooping) (upbeat western music) (laughing) - [Othar] Oh wait a minute, we got troubles. - [Dewey] What? - [Othar] Well look at that gas gage. We ain't gonna make it home Dewey. - [Dewey] Ain't gonna make it home? Closest place to stop is Slaton's store. (upbeat western music) - Hello there boy. - Hello. - What are we gonna do now? Slaton never comes out of that store now you know that. (car honking) Why don't you just get out and jump up and down on the hood? They're looking over here now anyway. - What's a matter Othar? If you want some gas help yourself I'm busy. - Tell him. - You tell him. Just turn around and tell him. - Tell him. - Tell him. - Mr. Slaton. Mr. Slaton could you come over here for a minute please? (whispering) Mr. Slaton could you help us with the gas? (suspenseful music) - Dewey, you ain't got no clothes on. (laughing) (shushing) I declare Othar what happened to your clothes? (laughing) - [Othar] Can you just get us the gas please? And keep your voice down. And we need two sets of overalls size 32 and-- - 30. - 30. - And we'd really appreciate it if you wouldn't mind getting it for us please. - I never thought I'd see the day anybody'd skin a Pruitt. (laughing) What are you boys trying trying to do here start a nudist camp? (laughing) - I'll swear to you I never thought I'd ever see you out like that. (laughing) - [Othar] Hurry up Mr. Slaton please. (harmonic music) - What's going on out there? - Well there's a Pruitt and a Crenshaw boy out there in the car and they don't have any clothes on. Got no clothes on. (chattering) - Hey Ruby could you do me a little favor, would you mind running these overalls out to the boys in the car? I'd appreciate it. - Sure Mr. Slaton. - [Dewey] Othar let's get out of here. Yahoo! (upbeat western music) (laughing) (chattering) (thudding) (suspenseful music) (chattering) - [Man] Ah that's a big box, it must be heavy. Ain't no telling what's in it though. Not going to stay around long enough to find out are they? (chattering) (suspenseful music) (roaring) (yelling) (laughing) (whooping) (upbeat western music) - (mumbling) Late as usual. - He sure is.

Believe I'll just wait right out here. - Well this ain't gonna take me long I'll be right back. Sir excuse me, excuse me sir. Pardon me ma'am.

Mind if I get by? - Go ahead. - Thank you. (country music) (gasping) What are you gonna do? - Just give me my clothes. - You're not gonna take my pistol? - [Othar] Just gonna borrow it for a little while that's all. - You just can't come in here and take my gun. - You want your gun back? Come on down to the swimming hole and get it. You know where that is, just go down the river about 12 miles and then turn left for about three miles and then you turn right for another four miles. (laughing) If you're lucky you might-- - You give me my gun back right now! - [Othar] Real nice meeting you again. What did you say your name was? - Listen I'm sorry we took y'all's clothes. - Well. - Just give me my gun back. - No. - But you just can't do that. You just come back here. You just, you can't do that I mean it. You just wait one minute, do you hear me? - If you want it back, you just come down the river about a quarter mile 'til you get to-- (thudding) - Whoa. You alright Othar? - Yes sir. - Nice gun. - Mmhmm. - Beautiful chrome. You do have a permit to be carrying in town don't you? - Oh no sir you see that's not my gun. It belongs to that young lady right there. - Is this your gun Miss Sally? - No. Guns just scare me half to death Sheriff. Don't even point that thing this way. (dramatic music) - Well it's real nice to have you down here with us Othar. We've been looking forward to this for a long time. - I'm telling you Sheriff that ain't my gun. - Well it don't matter much does it? You was carrying it.

(shouting) (rumbling) - [Othar] Sheriff get me out of here. Get me out of here. (rumbling) (train whistling) - Othar, Othar come on what are you doing there? You're free, come on. - Dewey, they were gonna let me out in the morning. (suspenseful music) (hammer banging) - Looks like we're gonna finish by tomorrow. Do you reckon the Sheriff's gonna let us go? - Sheriff said we'd have to paint it too. - Paint it? Well whoever heard of a jail sentence of rebuilding a jail? - Beats making little rocks our of big ones Dewey. - Yeah, I reckon. - [Women] Yoohoo. - [Sally] Look what we've got. - Hot dog it's dinner time. - Hi y'all. - How are you Sally Fannie? - Hi. (talking over each other) - Would you give me a hand? - Yeah I sure will. Oh you're a welcome sight girls. How are you Leola? - [Leola] Oh pretty good, how are you doing Dewey? - You've made my day. (laughing) Whoa be careful there. Have a seat here and just spread out the food. - I don't know if I'm gonna feed mister uppity over there. He ain't even got the manners to speak. - Morning. - I guess he spoke 'cause he's hungry. - No I ain't that hungry really. Thanks to you me and Dewey learned a new trade, building jails. - Don't you start in on that again. It was you trying to steal my pistol that landed you in jail. Besides if they hadn't put you in jail for that they should've anyway, for making moonshine whiskey. (laughing) - How do you know we make moonshine? - I just do. - Othar be nice to her. - One thing about you Dewey, you appreciate a girl especially when it's getting close to meal time. (laughing) - Othar see what you've done? Now they're getting on me. - Well Dewey why don't we go down and see if we can find us a nice shade tree? - Yeah I believe we will. - Here why don't you take it with you? - Bring the tool box back with you? - Yeah I will. - Bye Sally. - See you later Leola. - Bye Leola. - Bye Othar. - Dewey's alright ain't he? - Yeah. - Do you think he's funny? - I do, I think he likes Leola. - How come you're being so nice to us? - Well I guess I feel a little guilty. - Guilty? You don't need to feel guilty. I guess you could stay we started it all by trying to steal your clothes. - I'm glad you look at it that way. - What's going on up there? Othar you're supposed to be working. What are you doing up there Sally Fannie? I don't like no consorting of prisoners in my jail. Besides I need you boys. I want you to make the rounds with me. A lot of boys in town getting all hit up on bootleg whiskey. Gotta deputize you and Dewey. - Oh not again. - Come on. - Consorting is against the law. You better build him a bigger jail. - Bye. - Bye. (dramatic music) (chattering) - [Man] I still want three cards. Don't give me the three he has. - Howdy boys. - How about some water Sheriff? - Othar you and Dewey step out. - What's going on? - I'm right proud of you boys. You not only built me a fine jail you helped me fill it with customers. Now if you'll just sign right here for your possessions you're free men. - Oh I've never been so happy to get away from a place in my life. - Sign right here Othar. - [Man] Hey when do we get out of this place? (prisoner mumbling) - Good luck to you boys. Y'all take care. You boys just, we'll see you later now. You boys just settle down you're gonna be here a while. ♫ Feeling good (upbeat western music) ♫ Feeling good - Sure do feel good don't it Othar? (laughing) (upbeat western music) ♫ Feeling good ♫ Feeling good (suspenseful music) (thunder cracking) (wind blowing) (thunder cracking) - That's Bobby Joe's car. - You sure? - Yeah I'm sure. - Well maybe we ought to come back tomorrow night? - Grandad said McClusky needed that whiskey didn't he? - Yeah. Yeah but we don't want to cause no trouble. - Well we're here now, ain't no use is turning back. (talking drown out by rain) - [Man] This here's good stuff, all you need is to put more flavoring in it-- - No. I serve only the top ingredients. You boys taking our whiskey or not? (thunder cracking) - That's why he won't take out liquor Pa. - That right McClusky? - I said I was overstocked. - You ain't overstocked. You're buying all your stuff from one of those Pruitts. - I said I was overstocked, maybe the next one. - You got whiskey with you boy? I'm talking to you Pruitt. You got whiskey with you? - None of your business old man. (suspenseful music) - Bobby Joe, get the car. (suspenseful music) Come on boy. We let it go for now. (suspenseful music) - [Othar] Where do you want us to unload Mr. McClusky? - Take it around the back. (thunder cracking) - How's it going Grandad? - Hi Grandpa. How's the corn Grandpa? - Shoot a man couldn't grow enough corn on this rock pile to nourish a kaddy-do, but the Johnson grasses are doing good. How'd she go Othar? - Just fine Grandad. Old man McClusky upped his order another 50 gallons a month. - That's an awful lot of whiskey and a lot of trouble. What'd you tell him? - I told him we'd deliver. (suspenseful music) Grandad. I don't want Grandma and you worrying about us. - No son, no. (suspenseful music) - That's the straw that broke the camel's back. They can't cut us another 50 gallons a month. Pruitts have been a pain in my butt since I could walk. And I'm cutting I'm cutting it out. - What are they doing here? - [Dewey] Othar it ain't gonna do any harm for Sally and Leola to see us make whiskey. - Well if he's gonna act like that let's just go on Leola. - Look I don't mind seeing you but this ain't the place for it to be or for you neither. - Well just let me figure that out. Does that mean that you just want us to go on home or do you want us to stay here? - Othar quit picking on her. It's my fault, well I brung 'em here. - Well you're here ain't ya? I guess you might as well stay. - [Leola] Dewey-- (talking drown out by walking on rocks) - Yeah it's just about the best one in the county. - That was really hard for you to say wasn't it? - Yeah it was. - Well that's where we stick the mash in. - Othar will you teach me how to make whiskey? - Put the mash in there and the liquor comes out there. - Othar can I taste a little of it? - [Dewey] That's down there below. - Bootleg liquor ain't for ladies. (Leola laughing) But if you want you can grab that bucket and come to the spring with me. - Oh okay. - [Othar] Come on. - Right down below there. - Yeah. - That's the fire. (laughing) That sucker's hot. (bird screeching) (suspenseful music) - [Rufus] Pruitt! - I thought I smelled a pole cat. - We got him now Pa. - This here's judgment day Pruitt. - Well in that case I'll turn around so you can shoot me in the back like that kurt dog at sarchy-wood. - Shoot him Pa. - [Rufus] Don't you turn your back on me. - Go on shoot me. - [Bobby Joe] Shoot him Pa. - Oh you captain carpet bagging scissor foot you. - [Bobby Joe] Shoot him! - Turn around you hear? (thwacking) - [Bobby Joe] Shoot him. (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (knocking on door) - Well I'd like you to meet Arthur Grandshaw. - Pleasure to meet you.

(dramatic music) - Can we take a walk? (dramatic music) Othar I know how much you and Dewey loved your grandpa. But you're gonna have to let the sheriff handle this. Or this terrible killing's just gonna go on and on. - Grandma saw them do it. Not one of them Woodalls is gonna spend 30 days in jail. They'll get one of them new fancy Memphis lawyers to get 'em off. - Othar I want them to pay for what they've done just as much as you do. - No you don't. How could you? But they're gonna pay. As soon as we get Grandad decently put in the ground. - Othar you've gotta stop talking like that. Can't you see there's no end to it, that it's only gonna stop when everybody's dead? - Dead? They're already dead. I gotta do what I gotta do. Ain't no other way. Come on. (dramatic music) Grandma you're gonna have to stop that. They killed their last Pruitt Grandma. - I'm with you Othar. Let's go. - I wish you boys wouldn't do this. - Hold on a minute Dewey. - I know I've got more reason to wish the Woodalls dead than anyone. But you boys are all I got left. Let the Lord handle it. Please? - Grandma I want you to go up to the house. We're just gonna give the Lord a little help. Go on now. Get the dynamite. - Alright now. (suspenseful music) - Well I'm gonna finish cleaning this mess Pa but I don't see how y'all live in it. - Dorothy you just take care of that family of yours and you don't need to worry about us. We get along fine. (dogs barking) - Pa, somebody in the woods got them dogs all stirred up. I'm gonna go check it out. (dogs barking) (suspenseful music) It's just that old chicken stealing coon. Them dogs, them dogs run him down to the creek. Probably they'll never catch him though, he's too smart for 'em. - Sugar don't bother uncle Big-un now. Go on out and play now. (suspenseful music) - Give me your gun Dewey. You see that porch? - [Dewey] Yeah. - Do you think you can get the dynamite underneath there? - Sure. - I'm gonna cover you from across the way, you ready? - Yeah. (suspenseful music) - Oh my god. - Damn. - Pruitts! (gun firing) - [Sugar] Mama. - Baby. (screaming) (gun firing) - Dewey! (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (groaning) (suspenseful music) - You alright boy? (guns firing) (thudding) (gun firing) (guns firing) (suspenseful music) - Go fast! (gun firing) (cow mooing) - Check inside. Oh god. Boy's alive, we gotta get him to a doctor. - Alive, alive? - Get a hold of him. - Are you sure? - Get a hold of him. - Sheriff Bobby Joe and Big-un's dead. - Come on. See if you can find Rufus. Get him now. Othar, I'll have to take you in. You got no right to take the law in your hands, that's my job not yours. Get in. - Sheriff ain't a Woodall left got a breath of air in him. - Can we get going? - You stay here Carl I'll send out some help. - [Othar] Think Dewey's gonna make it Sheriff? - [Sheriff] I ain't no doctor. (cows mooing) - [Dewey] Hey Othar do you reckon they drink good moonshine whiskey in California? (laughing) - [Othar] Hey Dewey does a chicken scratch huh? Does a hog roost, does a hoot owl hoot?
