(playful music) - [Narrator] Why am I pacing? I'm pacing, I'm pacing back and forth. Why? What am I doing? I have things I need to be doing. I can't do this. I need to stop. I should be shaving. I need to shave and shower. I've got class soon. I need to start now. But I need some water first, yeah. I need a bottle of water, there's some in the fridge. There we go. Great. (phone rings) Oh, there's the phone. But, why so excited? It's the generic ring. It's not like it's Xan, why would Xan be calling now? What reason would he have to call? He's busy, he's always busy. He doesn't have time for that. Why should I? Why should I even have time to answer, should he be calling? I've got shit to do, I've got a lot of shit to do. I'm extremely busy, constantly. There's so much going on I can't handle it. Okay, why am I back in the bedroom? Why am I glancing down at the phone? Who gives a shit who called? I don't. Why would I care? I've got so much on my mind. What am I doing? Go shave, you look like a beast. Fuck, go shave. Oh my God, I do look like a beast. I need the phone. I need it here so I can keep track of time. Time passes so quickly. Probably because I'm pacing back and forth for the majority of it as if I had nothing to do. Oh, shit. It's Wednesday isn't it? Yeah, oh yeah, it's Wednesday and it's noon, and emulated Jamaica Kincaid, I have not. I need to write that piece. Fuck shaving, I can rock the tortured artist look. I need to write that piece. My laptop takes forever to load. Why is it so slow? I need to sit down. Why am I still pacing? Sit your ass down, and write that piece. About what though? Yeah, what am I doing? I should be shaving. I'm blocked. I can't write right now. But I guess I could pull something out of my ass, that's one thing I've got, I can always fall back on being funny. But if you had the choice, would you really choose to be funny? I mean, would you? People usually assume that there's not much else... What, what is that a bug? God I miss Amanda. - Okay, wait. - What's wrong? - Time out, alright, just go smoke a cigarette or something. (laughing) - [Man] Why? - You topped last time. - So? (applause) - Thanks so much for coming, it was really good seeing you again. - David. - Courtney! Hey. - Hey. Oh, I want you to meet Amanda. - Hey, how do you do? - Hi. - Amanda writes The Rage. - Oh, Courtney, you make it seem so official-- - Well. (chuckles) - No, I just do a new restaurant review occasionally, that kind of thing. Nothing special, just if they ask me to. - Wow, then I guess I'm outta luck, huh? - [Courtney] Yeah. - [David] So, then what do you do like, on a regular basis? - Oh, my dissertation, at Vanderbilt in English. Yeah, I went to culinary school originally, but it's kinda hard to find a job in that, so. - Yeah. - You were wonderful tonight, by the way. - Oh, you were hilarious tonight, David. (chuckling) - And you wrote it too, right? - Yeah. - [Courntey] Oh, he only does his own stuff. - Courtney, so not, not true. - Oh, hey, so do you think you're going to be able to do my play after all? - Of course, why wouldn't I? - Oh, Amanda knows Chris Bosco, the guy who writes for the theater section. - Yeah, yeah, I know who he is of course, I've never met him. - Yeah, yeah, he wanted to come tonight, but then he couldn't last minute, so, he asked me to take notes in case I wanted to write up an article or something and I think we'd be crazy not to. I mean it's just, it was wonderful. - Like an article about the show? - Yeah, it's witty, charming, you have a voice all your own, really, so, I was wondering if we could maybe sit down and talk about it? - Yeah, like, like right now? What are you guys? - Yeah. - Yeah, why don't we just go get a drink or something? - Yeah, yeah, you want to? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Great, Amanda, right? - Yeah. - Oh, when you enter that nine to five world, then you'll realize just how important those eight hours of sleep really are. You were wonderful. - Thank you daring. - Hysterical. - Thank you darling. - Good night, Amanda. - Good night. - Good night. - [Courtney] Good night. - Don't you have to be up early? Don't you have class tomorrow? - Uh, my days start at one. - Oh, so you can stay up late? - Late nights. (chuckles) - Well how much longer do you have? - Uh, technically I'm a junior. But, if I want to get out at my estimated graduation date, I'll have to start setting these little endeavors of mine off to the side, which I totally can't see myself doing. And, are you about ready to hit the sack yourself? I saw you checking your watch a second ago. - Oh, no, I was just checking. - Well in that case, you wanna get outta here and go get some coffee or something? Go for a walk? - Actually I know a really great place around the corner with desserts and delectables, I think they're open late. - That bakery right around the corner? - Yeah, yeah. Hey, how much was mine? - Exactly what I had in mind. - How much was mine? Thank you. - Are you sure you're not gonna turn into a pumpkin? - I think I'll manage. - Great. (pleasant music) What is this? - Cat? (laughing) - I'm just sure it isn't chicken. Alright, so, when are we gonna do it? - 21st, and 22nd. What? There's a conflict, isn't there? - Well, no, I mean, you know I'm understudying for Hamlet, right? - That's the same weekend? (huffs) - No, I mean, I think we'll be fine, I mean, it's not like they're gonna-- - David! You're outta TP. - Uh, there should be some under the counter. - I checked. - Are you serious? - No. I just thought I'd come out here and announce that my hoo-hah needs to be wiped. (chuckling) - David, come finish this, I just need to go out to my car. - You have toilet paper in your car? - I picked some stuff up earlier when I went and got everything for dinner. - You know, most people keep toilet paper in the bathroom. I guess you're not one of those people, David. (chuckling) - Well, thank you for dinner. And for the toilet paper. You're so resourceful. - Are you okay? You seem glum. - Well, I uh, found out tonight that Courtney's play is the same weekend as Hamlet. - But you're only an understudy. - Yeah, well, with my luck, they'll fucking need me. - Just don't worry about it. I mean, what if they did? What if they did need you? - Well, then... I guess I'd have to do it. - But you've committed to Courtney's project. - But I've also committed to Hamlet. I guess you're right, I don't need to worry about it. What are the odds? - You coulda said no! You could have backed out with them once you started rehearsing with me! - It's not like I can just leave them without a Hamlet. - You are the most selfish person I have ever met. All you care about is you, and what's best for you, and your little acting career, but you know what? You can just fucking go to hell! - Okay, I'll just get the car in gear, and I'll go. (ignition starts) - And you know what? - What? - Your breath fucking stinks! - Well no one said it was going to be easy. - Well she didn't have to act like such a fucking bitch about it, you know? - Given the circumstances I wouldn't say there were a variety of ways she could have responded. I mean can you honestly blame her for being upset? - Which one do I wanna get, do I wanna get a detergent that whitens whites and brightens brights? Or smells like fresh rain and has a stain lifter? - Uh, what does the one that whitens whites and brightens brights smell like? - Doesn't matter, I got the other one anyway. Uh, you know, I just, I don't like the way I feel right now, you know? She made me feel like such a piece of shit. - David, she's upset. I mean, really, can you honestly blame her? - Well she didn't have to call me a faggot. - Did she really say that? - Yeah. - It's something my mom made once, back when I had my wisdom teeth removed, I had nothing but soup for like three days straight. So, when cooking came to me, I demanded a copy of the recipe. And it's sort of a "get well, I hope you feel better" kind of thing. It's so funny too-- (big band music) - Alright we'll meet you there. - Oh, okay. Hey, by the way, you kicked ass. - Thank you. - It really was amazing how you managed to just throw-- - Hey, David. - Hey, Xan. - Listen I can't make it to dinner, but I just wanted to thank you again. You were great. Both nights. - It was a lot of fun, thank you for the opportunity. - Yeah, you're remarkable. - Thank you. - Give me a hug. - Thank you. - Alright, bye. - See you. He's just been in town a little longer than a year, and he's directed a couple things, so, and he was in Shakespeare in the Park, too. - Oh. (phone rings) - Hold on. Hello? Hey. Yeah, no, no, no, we haven't left yet, what's up? Yeah. Yeah, no, no, no, I'd like to, yeah, sometime yeah, that'd be great. Okay. Yeah, well I'll talk to you later, okay. Alright, bye. Xan just asked me out on a date. - What? - Yeah, isn't that funny? - So you think you will? - I mean, why not? He's really cute. - Hey, hey, so who's that guy Amanda came with? Is that David? - Yeah, that's David. The actor. - Okay, I thought so. I think I've seen him in something before. Is he gay? - I'd like to think so. - He does have a long torso. (laughter) - True story. - I'll just lay that there, so, his name's Robby. - Robby. I knew it. (chuckling) - Is it that obvious? Really? - Go on. - Is it that obvious? - Tell me about Robby. - So, okay. No really, is it that obvious? It's just some pathetic autobiographical bullshit? - No, just, tell me more. - Okay, so, anyway it's actually really romantic how we met, like in the play. So-- - Where'd you meet, I'm dying here? - Alright, we had a writing class together, I know that sounds stupid, but whatever. - Uh-uh. - Just wait. He sat across from me, usually, and um, I'd catch him every once and while you know, like, glancing over me, at me. You know that kind of thing where if you turn and look back at them they look away like they don't want you to know they're, - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so, anyway, one class, I noticed he was pulling that routine in the corner of my eye, so I'm looking up every 15 seconds or so, but it was like this systematic thing right? - Uh-huh. - And then I noticed that he was like sketching or scribbling something in his notebook. - Mm-hmm. - So, I sort of figured, well, fuck, he's kinda drawing me. And sure enough, after class, he um... I was sitting there with my professor, and we were um, going over something that I'd workshopped in class, something I didn't like. He always took a really long time to leave, I think he was hoping I would hang out and talk, so anyway, this time, it's obvious that he's gotta go, 'cause it's just me and the professor, one on one, and, as he walks out, he ever so casually slides the um, slides the sketch on top of my shit. - Sketch of you? - Yeah. - Oh my God. - And it was good. - Get out. - Yeah. - Wow. - So, I followed him outside where I knew he'd be, 'cause he always had like a cigarette after class by the front doors, and you know, I thought about before stopping and talking to him, but I really didn't have a reason to, other than the fact that, he's fucking hot, so... So I found him, he was there, where I knew he'd be, and um, we got to talking, and I thanked him for the sketch, and... He was just so gentlemanly, you know? Like he was trying to prevent the smoke from blowing in my face 'cause he knows I'm not a smoker, but little did he know I'm like one of the few people who likes the actual smell of cigarette smoke, you know, were it bottled I'd probably buy it as a cologne. And um-- - Fascinating. - So, then we exchanged numbers but we ended up hanging out like the rest of the day, we got some dinner, and some coffee. Well, hot chocolate, he wasn't really a coffee person, and um... Yeah, became pretty regular after that. We started dating, or, not really dating, we didn't really go out that much, we sort of stayed in, and he cooked a lot, oh my God, Amanda... Could he fucking cook. I don't know whether it's being like, growing up, in the back roads of wherever he's from, or being Italian, or what, but it was, it was some good shit. And yeah, we eventually got to it, the sex. It was unbelievable. - In the play it seemed like the struggle came from the boudoir. - Well, I mean, part of it did. And I would hardly call what we had a boudoir. (laughing) But um... But the play wouldn't have been as funny, believe me, if the two characters hadn't always argued over who would get to insert it. Yeah, you have to extract the entertaining bits, and just do away with the rest, but uh, shake it, shake it. Um... We hardly ever argue about it anyway. I was pretty passive. I was like, ugh, just get it over with. - Damn. - I liked it. So anyway, dot dot dot, thank you. I eventually came to the clonclusion... (giggling) I think I added a couple Cs and Ls in there and Us that weren't really there but um, eventually it surfaced that, you know, he was on all sorts of downers, uppers, whatever, and um. - Zoloft? - Yeah, shit like that. Not Zoloft though, I think it started with a P. - Prescription meds? - Well that's what they certainly were, but... (giggling) Anyway, it just seems like I'm always ending up with the fuckin' crazy prick, kamikaze fuckers, and when I started being more observant, and mouthy about his manic depressiveness he started spending, is that even yours? Um, he started um, spending time away, nights, just he wouldn't show up when we had plans, you know. - My hand's asleep. - Ugh, fuck. And obviously you know, like the demons set in, you know? - Yeah. - I thought he was, I suspected he was cheating, and obviously he knew he was. I knew it wouldn't last, anyway, he's not really doing much with is life, practical anyway, I mean, he's good, but, his art's not that good. (laughing) You know what I mean? - Yeah. - I mean he's not that much different, I mean. What? - You tell, such a good story. - I'm glad that the real version's more entertaining than, if I'd gotten laughs like that I think the play would have made more money. But anyway. Amanda, would you please, listen to me, here? - I'm listening. - 'Cause this is the best part. He was a spitter. - No he wasn't. (laughing) - Not like that! Like I mean, like he spit, (hawking up spit) anywhere he went, like we're talking total classless, like this is when his true colors and accent came into play. Total like, trailer honey. - I actually laughed more in the play. - You did? You should have laughed up, I didn't hear it. - Man. Yeah. Laughed more in the play. - Well, obviously, because things like that never end well in real life. You know, too afraid to... Forgive. What? We're to afraid to, - I know, you're right. - Call and quietly let the other person know that it's over. - It's true. - And, but, you know... Instead we laugh, no we shout and whatever we sever ties and hold grudges. (laughing) That's not funny! - It doesn't have to be like that. I mean-- - Well. - It just doesn't. - Yeah, well, not if you're Courtney. - Hey, who pays? - Who pays for what? - You know, like when you're out on a date? Like, you or the guy you're with, like how do you know how that works? - Shit, I don't know. - Just whoever grabs the check first, or what? - Okay, I can wear this, or I can wear this. - Um-- - There's another option. - I mean, where are you guys going? - [David] Uh, I don't know. - Well you should call and ask him. - Uh, no, I don't want him to know I'm thinking about it, he can't know I'm high maintenance yet, it'll disrupt the euphoria. Alright, this, or this? - The burgundy one. (pleasant music) (phone buzzes) Yes, David? - Well, he said he would call me tomorrow. (opera) So, um, act one was just so beautiful, wasn't it? - Mm-Hmm, Adina, Credini, Tene. (chuckling) - Yeah, I wish I understood Italian. - Whoever played Adina, she had a diction problem. - Yeah? - Her annunciation, it wasn't, it could have been better, but um-- - Yeah? - That's of little consequence. The second act though, what'd you think of it? - Uh, the first piece after intermission, it was um, well it was really really beautiful. (speaking Italian) He's just so great, you know? And charming, and cultured. From abroad. But he's so dark. I think I have a thing for dark guys, actually I do. Thank you. I know I do. My um, my first boyfriend, was half Iranian. Which, later proved ironic when he turned out to be a, well, for lack of a better word, terrorist. And then after that I dated a Creole. Which was pretty interesting, very well hung. But Xan... He's different you know? It's promising. A keeper. But you wanted to tell me something. Sorry. - Yeah, well, I got a job. - Awesome. Where doing what? - Teaching English. Sophomore honors English at a High School. - Awesome, like, now? Like so soon? - Yeah, apparently I'm replacing someone-- - Yeah? - They were having some problems or complaints, so, I'll start next semester. - Well, cool, I mean where, which school? - Um, it's in Murphisborough actually. - That's a far way out. - Yeah, I'll be moving. - When? - Soon. As soon as I find a place. - Sorry. Obviously, I'm thrilled for you, Amanda, that you're being presented such an opportunity, I'm just being, me. So it'll be like soon? Relatively soon. I'm just little sad, that's all. Cake's good. - Secret recipe. - I don't get it, you want a piece of lettuce, they give you a piece of lettuce, you want two pieces of cheese, and some mayonnaise, tomatoes, that's fine, but you know the minute you ask them to cut it differently, they just go berserk. They don't understand, what is so difficult about cutting a sandwich into four pieces? You know, you cut it in half, you have the two halves, then you cut it into four, so I can eat some later, I just, I don't get it. Anyway, I need to uh, go get ready, um, Xan and I have dinner plans. I'll see you later. - Bye. - Well, I mean, we could always order Chinese. - I'm kinda sick of Chinese. Just let me finish this email, I'll make something. (phone rings) Is that Amanda? - Yeah, she um, she wants to know what I'm doing tomorrow night, I'll just text her back in a second, let her know that we have plans. - Plans, David, she's leaving town in a week, you should probably have dinner with her, whatever she's wanting to do, whatever. - Well, I mean, would you wanna come along, obviously she wouldn't mind. - David, I'm sure she'd rather just see you. - So you wouldn't want to do anything tomorrow night? Who are you emailing? - It's a mass email concerning all parents of the children involved in the Christmas musical. To help out or volunteer in any way that they can. - Alright, I can see that now, thank you, I was just wondering, I was just asking. - And I love how you read into me not wanting to have dinner with you and your fag hag, as complete disinterest. - Well should I take it as partial disinterest? And so then yeah, he screamed at me, made me cry, you know? Told me that he likes me despite my blossoming co-dependency. Said that we should probably spend some time apart because he's so busy, and that he's probably keeping me from so much, from my friends, from my writing. Hey, I've got something here from Robby. - From Robby? What is it? - I don't know, it's some little postcard, inviting me to a gallery opening of his. I must have been on the automated list. Okay, so, Robby wants to see me. After the gallery thing he wants to have dinner. - You talked to him? - He called. - What about Xan? - Fuck Xan, you know? He'll either come around, or he won't. So I brought some selections, you can help me choose, since it's not for another couple weeks, and you won't be here. I thought it went really well, and your work has just matured so much. That piece with the sausage links? I mean that was just great, and the turn out was wonderful, I'm just so happy for you that you're doing so well. - You look kinda thin. - It was the worst 35 minutes of my life. And the food? The food was terrible, I couldn't even eat it, which must have seemed fitting after his fucking accusation. I mean, I don't get it, why am I so thin? You know? I eat, I eat all the time, I eat like Mama Cass, why don't I look like her? - [Recording] If you are satisfied with your message, press one. To listen to your message, press two. To rerecord, press three. To enter a callback number, press four. - [David] God I miss Amanda. - [Recording] Hey, this is Amanda, sorry I missed you, but leave a message and I'll call you back. - So when was the last time you talked to Amanda? - I don't know, uh, early last week maybe. We play phone tag, every now and again. - Is she seeing somebody now? I read on MySpace and she's in a relationship. - Yeah, she and this guy have been seeing each other for awhile. I forget what he does though, but uh, I don't know she doesn't really bring him up so I guess it's not enough for me to warrant ever asking about him. - That ice cream is fucking melting. (chuckling) I want another scoop. - Well you need to get something, listen to yourself Marianne Faithful. - Shut up. - I wish they'd hurry up with my Goddamn cheesecake. - I know, why didn't they bring it out when they brought this disaster? (chuckling) - I don't know, but our tip's gonna be minute. - Hey, how was lover boy? - I don't know, you know I thought we'd find more time for each other once, you know he brushed his little children's musical underneath the rug, but it was just the same old story, you know, he gets busier and busier and needs to catch up with work or friends, so, I don't know. Frankly, I'm tired of his bullshit, and I'm tired of trying to figure him out, so. - Well you always pick the same type of guy, anyway. - I'd hardly say that I pick, Liz, they usually have their way of finding me. - Yeah, but once they've found you you continue the relationship, I mean, you do have some say in whether or not you keep going out with them. Take some responsibility. - I have a type. - Yeah, you have a type. Dark and mysterious, creative something or others, who, can't keep their dicks out of other guys' mouths. I mean stop me when I'm going astray here. - No, you're good. (phone rings) And, speaking of Amanda. I'll be right back. Hey. - Hey, you. What are you up to? - Nothin', just lunching with Liz. - Aw, tell Liz I said hey. - I will, so what's up? - Well, I was just calling to invite you to my house this weekend. - Your house? You bought a house? - Kevin and I are renting it. - Wait, who? - Kevin, my boyfriend. - Right, no-no-no-no I just, you must have cut out or something. Wow. Wow, so, you've got a house now. - Yeah, um, I, I mean we're wanting people to come and celebrate with us, and you know, I thought you could come and I know y'all haven't met yet, but you and Kevin haven't met, but you can come and just approve him too. I just know you're gonna love him, so, um, bring Liz too if you want, and um, there's kinda someone else I want you to meet, so. - You're not gonna believe this, the fuckin' waitress ate a piece of your cheesecake. - I don't doubt that she did. - I tried to stop the bitch. We almost got kicked out. - I appreciate that. - You're welcome. (upbeat music) - Sam, hey. - Hey! - It's so great seeing you. - It's so good seeing you! Um, hi, how are you? - Good. - Liz. - Malcolm. - Uh, Amanda's in the kitchen. - Oh, cool, um, do you know where the bathroom is? - Oh, it's down there, down the hall. - Okay. - You want me to take that to her, to the kitchen? - Sure, that'd be great. Thank you, Sam. - How do you even eat this thing? - The trifle? - It's so deep, how do you try all the layers? - That's why the layers are redundant. - Amanda, David's here. - Oh, he is? Great. Where is he, did he not come in behind you? - He had to use the restroom. - Oh. - He'll be fine, he'll find his way back here, God those look amazing. - Sam, no, not yet. - Oh, Abbie it's fine, it'll be as if they never existed in the next five minutes anyway, so... Hey did he bring anyone with him? - No, well, I don't know, just Liz. - It's just there's someone I wanted to introduce him to, so. - How the hell are you supposed to serve that thing? - Uh, Dave, David, right? - Hi. - Recognized you from the few hundred pictures Amanda has. Propped up and hung around this place. - Well I hadn't noticed yet, I, well I haven't had a tour, so. - How was the drive? - It was good, it was long. I listened to the radio for the first time in, who knows how long? Like the real radio, I usually just tune in to a Jazz station, but um, for the life of me I couldn't find one up here, so. - Really? - Yeah. - Even on AM? - Yeah, even on AM. - Strange. - Very. - So what are you doing now? Are you working on something? A play or what do you? - Yeah, actually I'm working on this psychological thriller, it's about a lab technician who tests hallucinogens on single-mothers. No, I'm not writing anything right now. (chuckling) - Hey, Faith, could you help me with this? Thanks. - Oh, what if I drop it? Kidding. - Hey, Amanda, is he here yet? Do you know? - Oh, yeah, yeah, actually I was just on my way to find him. - What's that? - A trifle. - A what? - Who gives a shit, let's just eat it. - But uh, so what do you do? - I am a photographer. - Really? - Yeah, really. - I just thought you looked like you could be a realtor or something. (chuckling) - I uh, I have been told I look like I could effectively sell a house. (chuckling) - So, what kind of stuff do you do? - Nudes, mostly. - Really? - No, no, I'm kidding, but a little birdie told me you once posed for a sculpture class, yeah. (chuckling) - Have you been fishing for that for awhile? - No. Just curious. - I'll bet. - Tell me, David, have you ever modeled though? For a real photographer? - A real photographer? Yeah, um, years ago, I must have been 16. - Hey. - Hey! - How are you, getting on famously I see? - You look great. - I look like I've been in the kitchen for the past three hours, but thank you. - Whatever, alright, so where is he? The beau. The guy I must promptly approve of. - I guess between our biographies I forgot to introduce myself. Kevin. - Right, yeah. It's nice to meet you. - And you too. - I made your favorite, and everyone's been wondering what the hell it is. - Oh, have they? - Amanda do you have another bottle of Merlot, or did we drink it all? - Um, I'm not sure, maybe. And to which question I'm not sure. Should we go check? (playful music) (chattering) (phone ringing) - Hello? - David, hey, it's Kevin. - Hey. - What's up, what are you doing? - Oh, I'm just, I'm just cooking. - Listen um, I'm gonna be in Nashville tomorrow to uh, to take some pictures 'cause you know the weather's supposed to be nice, so um, I was wondering if you want to get together for a cup of coffee, or you know help me knock out a few exposures or a row? - Um, yeah. Sure. What kind of camera is that? - It's a Pentax. - Well what can it do? - What do you mean, what can it do? - Like I don't know, I don't really know anything about cameras, but cameras today they can do just about anything right? Like cellphones? - Well, yeah, I mean, but no this one's actually a manual, it's pretty old, I've had it forever. But I mean, I know what you mean about technology, it's... But trust me all that digital processing is a photographer's worst nightmare. - [David] Yeah, I hate technology, I just recently, like in the past year purchased a laptop for my writing, it just seems like so much of our time and money today is spent on more machines. iPods, video game consoles, DVD players-- - [Kevin] I have to admit to being a video gamer. I think it accounts for my somewhat addictive personality. But they don't make games the way they used to, just for racing cars and blowing stuff up. You know apparently Shamoo, you know the whale? Has his own video game. - [David] Well, what's he gonna do, get beat? (chuckling) (Jazz music) - So what are all the trays for? - Um, this is the developer, it um, to develop the photo agitates in the chemical for three to five minutes or so. And uh, that's just the stop, it washes off the developer. This is the fix, it prevents it from developing further when exposed to light. And then the final tray there is the wash, it's the last wash before the perma-wash. - Sounds time consuming. (chuckling) So how long did you say that part takes? - It depends, three to five minutes or so, just using, with the fiber based paper, see there it goes. Sometimes it takes awhile to star, but once it kicks in, there's no stopping it. - Wow. The contrast is amazing, all the lights and darks. - Well I mean, look what I had to work with. You're a fantastic subject. - Right. - God, look how photogenic you are. - It's just the angle. - Look at that smile. You've got beautiful teeth. What's your secret? - Toothpaste. (phone rings) Hey. - What are you up to? - Oh, nothing. - So, whatever happened with swell Steve? I mean, I really couldn't tell whether you guys hit it off or not. - Oh, well, we exchanged numbers. - Aw, you didn't think he was cute? - That, and, he probably doesn't know his stage left from his stage right. - David. Well I guess, more importantly, what'd you think of Kevin? - What'd I think of him? - Yeah, what'd you think? - Well I think he's great. - Yeah? - Yeah, I mean he's um, he's really well spoken, and I think he has a great appreciation for the arts, and he travels too, he said. - Well, what'd you think, did you think he was cute? - Yeah, yeah of course he's got that um, smoldering look about him, it's really nice. He's um, he's really attractive. - So, what have you got going on this weekend, anything? - Well I'm sure I could whip something up if you give me a second, why? - Well I was kinda wondering if you wanted to come up for a couple of days. - A couple days? - Yeah, I mean, I know it feels like you were just here, and you were practically, but, I miss you, you know? I miss seeing you. Kevin and I were going to be in town for a little while on Saturday and I thought maybe we could pop by and pick you up, drive you back with us. It's not like you would have to worry about driving at all, Kevin could drive you back on Monday in time for your class. Still starts at one, right? (bouncy Jazz music) Tucking you in. - Yeah, snug as a bug. - In a rug. (chuckling) Good night. - Good night, thank you. ♫ Love with me ♫ Somewhere on the sea ♫ Beneath the stars ♫ Darling ♫ Walk with me ♫ Somewhere on the edge ♫ Of life ♫ Run with me ♫ In the dark ♫ When it rides ♫ Darling ♫ Walk with me ♫ Somewhere on the edge ♫ Of night ♫ - Hey, Faith, it's Amanda. Hey, listen, um, Kevin's gonna be late tonight, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to come over for dinner? Oh, okay. Great. - Hey. - Hey, I'm here. - Okay, I'll be right out. ♫ I believe in the air so ♫ Dark black ♫ I believe in the shadow ♫ Of one ♫ And I believe in the daughter ♫ Of two ♫ I believe in the darkness ♫ Of you ♫ My love ♫ My love ♫ My darkest ♫ Love ♫ - Hey, Faith. Yeah, it's Amanda. Listen, Kevin's gonna be late again tonight, and I was wondering if you've had dinner already? Oh. Oh, no, that's fine. ♫ All I need ♫ Is you ♫ To show me ♫ The dark ♫ - Did you not make a, why isn't there a print of that one? - Which one? - That one. - Oh, it's probably too small to see there, but there's a horrible dust problem with that one. (phone buzzes) And the one above it there, you see? - You can't just dust it off? - Negatives are delicate, David, they scratch. - Okay, if you're saying it's fucked because it has dust on it, then what's the harm of dusting it off? I mean, you get a scratch, you get a scratch. If not, problem solved, right? (chuckling) - No, right. - So did you do something wrong? - Did I do something wrong? - Uh-Huh. - Did I do something wrong? Is that what you're asking me? - Mm-Hmm. - Telling you there was dust on it, that's what I did wrong. (doorbell rings) Expecting somebody? - No. Uh, I don't know who it could be. (doorbell rings) It's Liz. - Don't open it. - She probably already heard our voices, our cars are outside. - Hey, I had to drop some stuff off at the post office so I thought I'd just come by and see what was going on. Hey, Kevin. I didn't know you guys were gonna be here. Where's Amanda? What, for how long?! - I don't know, since we met? - David, are you crazy? What about Amanda? Is he planning on leaving her? - I don't know, we haven't really talked about it. - You haven't talked about it? David he lives with her in her house. Do you have any idea what you're doing? - Look, alright, I know we need, I know we need to tell her, and eventually we're gonna tell her, I just, Liz, promise me you're not gonna say anything? - I really wish you hadn't told me this. - Liz, promise me you're not gonna say anything. - I'm not gonna say one fucking word. I don't want to have anything to do with this, and I really don't wanna know you anymore. - Bye Liz. David why the fuck did you open the door? - [David] What was I supposed to do? - Not open it, wait for me to hide in the bathroom, you know, something? - In the bathroom, Kevin what are you talking about? Do you just want to go on hiding this? Is that what we want, to just hide it? - No, I don't think we have to worry about hiding it anymore, I'm sure that your fag hag will take care of that part. - Kevin, she's not gonna say anything. - David, that's bullshit and you know it. - Well we need to start figuring out what to say to her. I just... You can't go on living with her, not while we're doing this. I mean you're gay! - Yeah, well, Amanda knows, okay? She knows I have a history with guys, that won't come as surprise to her. The part about you, that'll, that'll, fuck... David what do you suggest really? "Hey, Amanda, we have something to tell you, we're fucking." Come on, do you know what that'll mean, David? Are you ready for what that'll mean? You know, Christ, she probably already thinks something is up, I mean, you wanted to come spend the weekend with us after we had just met. - She invited me alright, and I assumed you had a say-so, or you that you'd express interest in having me. - Look, whatever, I don't want to do this right now, we shouldn't even be having this conversation. - We shouldn't? Of course we should be having this conversation, Kevin, what are you talking about? - I don't know, I don't know. - You don't know what? You don't know what, Kevin!? - I don't know, David, you shouldn't have opened the door! Alright? You just, you shouldn't have opened the door. - Okay, what, now you're gonna go, you're leaving? - [Kevin] Yes! - Why? - Because David, I need to go home and decide whether to... You know, I don't know, I don't know. - Kev-Kevin. (knocking) - You look so sheepish. I mean I thought I'd seen all the faces, on stage and off, but, I guess this is what you look like when you think you've really done something wrong. Which we all know doesn't happen very often. - Amanda, I'm sorry. - Shut up. I want to know why. - I don't know why. - I do. I knew getting into the relationship that Kevin had been with men before. I knew from knowing you, that's it's not so much a trend as it is instilled. And I knew that you two would probably eventually have to meet, and more than likely you would be attracted to each other. Or at least, that you would see something in him, and say something to him. But I thought that if either one of you cared about me, at all... That you would tell me, or that he would end it first. Or that you would just refrain. None of which you did. Instead, he waited, you waited, until you were absolutely sure I would find out. Well surprise, I've seen it coming. I'm actually kind of glad that it happened now and not a moment later. Because I can't imagine spending another minute with someone who would prefer you to his fag hag. Did he take your picture, David? Is that what it was? That he wanted to capture you? Did that turn you on? Did it?! - Look, Amanda, he called me up one day-- - David, David, I don't want to hear it, I don't want to hear any of it. I don't want to hear what he said, or how he made you feel, how he misled you. You know, I don't wanna fucking hear it. It's the same, redundant, woe is me tale every time, and the fact that you can still say, "He's a keeper," with a straight face after going on one date with the guy, it's beyond me. - Look, I don't, I wanted to, I wanted to tell you, alright? I just, I didn't know how. - You're good, David, you're really good. I don't even know when you're acting anymore. I don't even think you know. - I'm not acting Amanda, what do you think this is? - David that's all you do, that's all you ever do, is act! - What? - You're always acting. - No, I'm not! - Always, always playing the victim, you're always acting! - I'm not always acting! - Oh, what an actor, what a great actor you are! - I'm not an actor, alright, I'm not acting! I'm just a really good liar. - That is one thing I believe.

Just what I had in mind. (laughing) And he was a spitter, not like that, like I mean he spit, (hawking spit) anywhere we were, or went. - The ending was much happier in your book. - Well, obviously, because things like that never end well in real life, you know, we're too afraid to forgive, we're too afraid to calmly and quietly let the other person know it's over, you know instead we shout, we fight, we sever ties. Burn bridges. - Yeah, but it doesn't have to be like that. And hey, who pays? Like, when you go out, who pays? - Huh? - [Actress] When you go out, when you're on a date with a guy, who pays? Do you, or the guy that you're with? I mean, how do you know? - I don't know, whoever grabs the check first. (applause) (mischievous music) - Hey, Dave, David, hey, Chris Bosco, I write for The Rage. - Chris Bosco. - Hey, yeah. - Hi, yes. - I just gotta tell you, you were great tonight, your writing, it just goes full circle doesn't it? - Thank you. - Yeah, if this is up and running all weekend, of course it's too late for me to get anything printed up but I know some guys over at Lightning 100 that could get you some radio spots for sure, people gotta know about this so. - That, that'd be awesome I'd really appreciate that. - Right, you got a uh, a cast party you're going to now? - Oh, no, that's Sunday night, so. - Alright, well if you want to get together some time, get a cup of coffee, I'd love to pick your brains. You know if you want to some time, I don't want to keep you, but uh-- - Oh, no-no-no-no, you're fine. - But, uh, if you want to some time, or if you want to tonight, if, if you're free.
