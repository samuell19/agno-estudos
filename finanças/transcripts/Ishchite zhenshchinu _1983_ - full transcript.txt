LOOK FOR A WOMAN but... Part Two Maitre Rocher's notary. Yes, he's here. Yes, here and in one piece. Yes, in one piece... Sorry, I meant to say I'm connecting you. I'll never forgive you for that... To declare that Maitre Rocher is murdered! You should be in jail for a week for that. To make us so happy, and to lie so badly! I trusted you so much! But thanks to your visions Maitre Rocher doesn't have any illusions about us. And his wife also...Reported in all the details. Maitre Rocher may have a tween. Dissipation again! Here are the conditions. Maitre Rocher doesn't speak to me as it is all my fault. How much filth he got covered with! I was the only one who stood up for him. Thank God this tragedy was only in the head of this neurasthenic. Shut up, scarecrow! My head is cracking already. I haven't read a newspaper yet. This has to be sent today and immediately. - I'll send Virginia. - You'll go yourself. You'll take a walk and breath fresh air. You are green. - What color am I? - Green. Don't be sad, green is the color of hope. In this office I don't hope for anything or anybody. It is wonderful when you don't rely on anything, it's the only way not to be disappointed. How do you feel yourself, Mademoiselle Postic? Better today? You should have a good doctor, I'll take care of it myself. Attention, please! I underline yesterday's strange and sad incident. Everyone, who will say a word about it will be fired. Without comments. Why are you still? Work, work. To your places. Believe me, I don't like to be a gendarme. But after yesterday discipline can get loose. I bet a lot of dirty laundry was puled out after I... died. Why don't you speak? You forbid to speak about it, Maitre. Tomorow we'll visit Somono's house... I thought... why should you shake in the train? You could go with me by car. I wait for you at Rivoli at 7:00 a.m. Work, work. I've changed my opinion regarding your outfit. I have to admit you look good in it. We're aging and the fashion is progressing. Nothing we can do with it. Your eyes are puffed up. You've been crying? I have no reasons for smiling, Maitre. Susanna...How many years have we worked together? Five years and three months. My God, how long. Don't... We could go to a cafe sometime, to celebrate our long friendship. Not now, I am too busy now, but sometime later... Definitely. This is for you. I don't like to be a policeman, mademoiselle Alice, But after yesterday discipline can get loose. I bet a lot of dirty laundry was puled out. Yes, a lot...Forgive me, it is all my fault. What an incredible story, fantastic story! But I can bed my head, that it was... Don't. We'll need it. Our policeman was very kind and gave the table cloth for the expertise. Blood or ink. That's great, now your conscious will be clear. It's undoubtedly ink. Just a second, I'm connecting you. What's with you? I just don't want to talk to anybody. Why do you scream? -It seemed to me.. - Something also seemed to you yesterday. You should know better, mademoiselle Alice. Pull yourself together. Forgive me, I am a bangle of nerves today! - Maybe you should take a vacation? - Maybe. No, I don't need it. I die from boredom on vacations. I eat a lot because of it and later don't fit my dresses. I am impressed by your thoughtfulness. Oh, no, I don't have it at all! All right we won't argue. I am even ready to pay for your vacation. You are our senior worker, I can afford to take care of you. What is it?! Because of your hysteria my hands are shaking. You still think that I am dead? I am alive, I am warm. Touch me, try. This is a watch! This is metal! Now you see that I am not dead? Yes truly, I have to admit. But what about the clue? What clue? - What is it? - The key. Where did you find it? I found it yesterday. Beside the step. There are initials here: G-N. But none of our workers has such initials. I thought about that too. One of the clients probably lost it. Give it to me, I'll ask everybody. Oh, no, mousier! You already have so much to do. I'll give it to my best friend, inspector Grandin. Did you loose your memory? Did you forget how he treats you? I can imagine the conversation...- I found a key. - So take it to lost-and-found and bite your tongue. Yes, you are right. I thought a lot about you, Alice. To rise your spirit I want to satisfy your request and raise your salary. Oh Mossier, you are so kind... Forget, forget this silly story. You are such a clear-minded woman. Clear-minded! Everybody is teasing me! Do you know what a seller from the milk store told me? "Mademoiselle Alice, are you having visions like Joan of Arc?". You see, nobody believes me. - Everybody thinks it seemed to me, and I... - And you? Distract yourself. Forget this story. Yes, why do I need all this? Should I forget the second clue too? What is the second clue? A button. What button? Look Maitre. Beautiful button with shell inside. Where did you find it? In your office, beside the desk. - Strange... - Exactly. I too thought that it was very strange. You know what...Give me all your clues, I'll take it to inspector myself. He wouldn't dare to treat me like you. Oh, no...My internal voice tells me - Don't be a coward, Alice. Go by yourself. I hope your internal voice doesn't betray you. I just wanted to be kind. Oh, mouser, you are so kind today. Jirardi's case papers. You are incredible! There is a mistake in the very first line! - I'll retype now. - Don't. Why? I'll correct myself. It's nothing. It's all nothing. The end of the world. Now that he is dead, he became a human. So, type. "Anonymous letter to inspector Grandin." - "Dear Riri"... - If you start this way he'll understand who the letter is from. - You are right. "Dear inspector." - "Dear, dear." What a tenderness! "Old wreck... cure your cold, but remember... that there are new clues in Rocher's case. Read carefully the article in the newspaper "Body at the Swan's island". "Policemen Boler and Furge have found a body of a man, who was stubbed into his back. - There was nothing on the body. -...nothing that... ... that would help to determine the identity of the murdered. The investigation is in progress." Swan's island in 10 minutes from here. So you really think that yesterday there was a man here with the knife in his back? I don't think, I saw! I saw! So while you were laying here unconscious...He got up and walked along the river, down to Swan's island. And there he fell and died. - We need to phone to inspector immediately! - You're right. Phone. Well... you are a great detective, mademoiselle Alice. Is it inspector Grandin? Hello. What did you say? Bless you. This is Virginia, Maitre Rocher's typist. Oh, no, you won't kick the bucket. You shouldn't say so. We have news. Your closest friend, mademoiselle Postic is beside me. What should I tell her? Where should she go? Bastard! How rude! So listen, I have three most important news. First - I found the key with the initials G-N. Second - I found a button. Third - the body on Swan's island and it wasn't me who found it, but your police. So, considering all this, I would like to know first - Does the dead body have all the buttons or one is missing? Second - are "G" and "N" his initials? And third - did you get kicked on your brains, inspector Grandin? So you think that they found the body of the man you saw here? I am looking for the connection between two facts. Because I couldn't mistake Maitre Rocher for somebody else. Well, after you told everybody about your clues, I think, the murderer is hunting you. Why can't I keep my tongue behind my teeth? And don't leave without a good reason. Don't go out. Don't frighten me. I saw it in movie... Mouser policeman. - I'm glad to see you. - Me too. I brought the tablecloth. - So? Blood or ink? - I don't know. They didn't take it. There is no official order of the office and in the office they think that if Maitre Rocher is alive there is no case. - Well, thank you for your kindness. - It was nothing. The incident is over. - You think so? - I think so. Inspector also is in a great mood. I put him into bed and he sleeps like a baby now. No. Mademoiselle Alica has phoned him and woken him up. - Why? - Mademoiselle Alica found new clues. - What clues? - I myself will let Riri know about it. In this case I'll wait for him - I want to laugh with everybody else. What do you say about this? It is my key! Where did you find it?! At the first step. It isn't my key, it's my neighbor's key from his motorcycle. I was looking for it for all day. He said he wouldn't never give me the bike again if I wouldn't find the key. - What does G-N mean? - It is his initials: Jack Nuare. His is my neighbor. I don't know how to thank you. Don't leave, I beg you. Don't leave me alone with this... mister Inspector. Cheer up - you still have the button. But don't lose it. You are right. The desk isn't a safe place. Swiss bank. What's this noise again?! You are just tireless mademoiselle Alice! You are here again. I am not amused by the visits of police any more. I am waiting for inspector Grandin. - Why here? - Where else? It isn't waiting room, it's notary. I didn't call for police! You didn't, but mademoiselle did. So it is you! I thought so! Leave! That's enough! The comedy with my death got too long! I end this story. What are you curious about? Ah, this is the ink which was mistaken for blood. Good buy mister policemen. - Should I wait at the staircase? - Wait where you want. - What is this? - This is mine, I want to take it. Oh, I forgot my hat too. It can't be that these stains... Don't touch me. Help! This time active madness? No. I was attacked. They wanted to kill me. No, mademoiselle Alice, it was short fuse. Breaker has burnt. No! It was attempt of murder. He probably ran away. Catch him, catch! I was going down the stairs and saw nobody. I heard you screaming. Absolutely right, I was returning from the post office and didn't see anybody. It looks like mademoiselle Alice has visions again. If it will go on this way I recommend you to work in circus. Your number would be the best. Maitre, I swear, somebody threw me on the floor, covered me with the cloth and started to go through me from feet to head. The button... The button is gone. Everybody, stay where you are. Quiet! Last clue... Last clue is gone... I'm dead. Did you recognize the person who attacked you? No! How could I? He threw me down and started... Hand, hand. The hand which was...could you recognize it? Hand....No! Typical hand! How could I recognize the hand?! My God, I'm dead... To throw on the floor...in the dark...and also the hand on... What "on"? Envy, ah? I know only one thing, now that you don't have the button inspector is going to leave wet stain instead of you. I promise you that. Everybody, run. I will return. I want to buy cigarettes! I leave you, mister detective, with our the most precious worker. And I want to tell you, mademoiselle Alice... who plants wind will harvest storm. Well, mademoiselle Postic, where are you clues? You will be very upset, Riri... What are you mumbling there? Facts! - How is your health? - I'm dying. Are you happy? No, Riri. But I'll tell you something that won't improve your health. Would you like some bojole. Once again, as I see, it's a false call. Somebody killed power. And while it was dark... I was thrown on the floor... and the button was gone. Explain it to me. What button? I'll explain it. So I go to work and suddenly see something glimmering beside the first step. I bend down... A key! With the letters "G"-"N". You see? Then I walk into Maitre Rocher's office and see a button beside the desk. Wait. First is the key. But the key turned to be Maximen's naighbour's key. - Second is the button... - The button...but it's gone! Though I hid it in such piquant place. But someone was brave enough to... Desperate fellow, desperate! I have trouble after trouble and you are joking. Yeah, I have reasons to joke...It's all great. Why should I stay in warm bed? Pneumonia will finish me... but this is trivial. I am absolutely fine. So what is the third clue? The third clue! The body on Swan's island! And if there is any connection between this body and mine then I'll be able to prove that I TRULY saw a man with the knife in his back! How did this button look? Button...was round...not too small... reddish color with shell inside. Central? Is it Gadar? Grandin speaking... Listen, was it your shift when the body from Swan's island was delivered? Take a look at the report...Didn't his raincoat or jacket have some special buttons? You should have guarded your trophy better. - But I didn't think that it's all about the button? - Of cause it is! Optimist! So one button is missing on his jacket. What kind? Damn it! It matches. With shell, exactly... I won! I won! Quiet! Not it's not for you, it's for the one who runs around with this button like hen with an egg. Runs around and loses everything. Yesterday she lost the body, today - the button. Yes, you are right. She should be guarded. It's possible they will want to shut her up once and forever. I'll leave a policeman with her. I'll phone to my office, I may find something about "G-N". No... You have such a long tongue...Is there anybody there? Don't move! You are mute like fish. Otherwise the rest of your adventure you will share not with me but with... Matre Rocher's notary is listening. Madame Rocher, you scared me so much. - Is my husband busy? - Yes...Actually no, he left for a second. Sit down. - How do you feel yourself after yesterday? - Accordingly - you see yourself. Well, it's all good that ends well. Isn't that so? Oh yeah? If it ends... Police is here again. But I didn't tell you anything. I am fish. - Did they find something? - "They"...They didn't, I did! And a lot! What do you mean "a lot"? I can't tell you this. You see, it's a secret between me and police. So keep your secret, mademoiselle Alice. Article "Body at Swan's island". So what? What connection between this body and your visions? I don't know...We are searching... I'm afraid there is nothing to search. Nevertheless I did find! Two clues! It is the key and the button. So what? Well, the key turned out to be Maximin's neighbor's key, but the button... It's from the body found at Swan's island. - I thought it was his initials "G-N". - What initials, you were saying? "G.N." - Maximin's neighbor. Thank God... I thought it belonged to the man, killed in our office. But...I wasn't lucky. It depends... But who could steal the button? At first I thought that somebody wanted something else and grabbed the button as cover... but he could do it more carefully. Life isn't that simple. How interesting - this isn't my neighbor's key. I was surprised yesterday, why would he have his initials here... So "G.N." isn't my neighbor. - Madame, I need to ask you some questions. - I am too tired. I'll go home. I just phoned to commissariat, they have news. Have you ever heard the name Julienne Nalestro? Do you know this name, madame? I don't think so...But I meet a lot of people. - Don't look among far acquaintances, look among close ones. - No, I don't know Julienne Nalestro. Poor fellow. He is the murdered man from Swan's island. Imagine that... I know. Fish told you! I didn't say anything! Mademoiselle just told me about the body on the island and I put it together. Next body will be yours. And I'll be the murderer! What else did you tell madame Rocher? Nothing. I was sitting like this... Now if I need to inform entire Paris I won't resort to newspapers or TV, I'll just secretly share it with you. - It's all my fault again? - You are incredibly smart. Was it Julienne Nalestro who you were seeing at mousier De Sharance's place? Yes. - Did you love him? - We were meant to meet today. I don't know what happened. Don't you think that your husband out of jealousy could... No. My husband knew everything. 2 months ago we agreed that each one of us... Even if we imagine that Nalestro was murdered here could mademoiselle Postic take him for Maitre Rocher? No, they are so not like each other. I was informed in commissariat that Nalestro wore Italian hat... I remember! You said Italian hat? I saw him! I saw him in that hat! - Where? - Downstairs, in the hall. - When? - Two or three days ago. He was standing beside mailbox... When he saw me, he asked if it was Maitre Rocher's notary I told him "Yes, but today it's already closed. Come tomorrow morning." And what did he say? He said something...but I forgot what... I remembered! He told me "Thank you." It looks like Nalestro was already in the building and, probably, yesterday at 18:30 between him and your husband happened a tragic scene. Investigation came up with such outcome. At 18:30 your husband was expecting the faulty Dutchman. May be that was your Nalestro? Oh God, I don't know... But the only thing that can save my husband is that truly, there was a Dutchman, called Van Berg. He had an appointment. For my husband that would be an alibi. You may be right. But your husband... Not a sound, please. Inspector! You are here again. I was waiting for you. I didn't know that...I went out to get some cigarettes, met a friend... Any news? Another vanished body? This time real one. It was found this morning at Swan's island. - I don't see any connection. - But I do. Klara, is that you? You came to collect me? What a surprise. How nice of you, thank you. No matter what you say, it was you with the knife in your back! How stubborn you are, mademoiselle Postic. It was quit dark in the room...it was dusk, and she imagined... How? How do you know it was dark in the room? It means it was you. Admit it, Maitre... Show us your back, Maitre. - What? - Show your back. You think I walk with the hole in my back? Not a hole. You can kill me! You can cut my tongue off, but it was... A great idea! About the tongue! We'll go now, my dear...I am ready. What's with you, Klara? Are you that tired? Do you know Julienne Nalestro? - No. - It's useless to deny it. You wife told us. I see...That's better. I thought that my wife's lover was my clerk, mouser De Sharance... I was sure that he was crazy about her. It seems I was wrong. What are you saying! Have you ever met Nalestro? Mouser Grandin, may I swear before you like before the judge? I mean, like under the oath? Why not? I swear that I have never seen mouser Nalestro and never spoke to him. I swear. Are you satisfied? Ask about Van Berg. Yesterday at 18:30 you had a meeting with somebody. Yes. Ah, mademoiselle Postic knew about it. The name of the man I was expecting is Van Berg. He sent me a letter... and offered to reveal the name of my wife's lover for big sum of money. It was typed. No signature. - So was Van Berg here? - No. "I can tell you the name of your wife's lover..." Letters "b" and "r" are barely seen. It is the same. This letter was typed on this typewriter. You mean to say that I was blackmailed by one of my workers? Possibly. Or you typed it yourself and created unexciting Van Berg to create your own alibi. How do you dare?! Innocent should always stay calm. Justice rarely makes mistakes. Isn't it clear? The same man who sent me this letter played my role to frame me. Do you see now? I think so. But who? Who would need to confuse everything? Everything still leads to the murder of Nalestro. Oh, hell, I swore to you that I have never seen this Nalestro! I swore to you that I have never seen Nalestro alive! In other words... If I got you right... You saw him only dead. Did you mean that when you swore? Inspector, I beg you, don't leave me! I have no strength. You have strength for lovers however! What a day it was! We didn't work at all. As if you work any other time. Police turned Paris up side down. They even searched at my place. I was so scared. Two men, at night...How rude. - Why me? - You adore Maitre Rocher. Tell everybody that he is innocent... That is a good reason enough to give him refuge. I think he is hiding to conceal his wife...it's her. I don't think it's her. I think it is... I am from police. They held me for half a day. Luckily I have nothing to do with it. Confess who the murderer is! - Where is mademoiselle Alice? - They took her to identify Nalestro's body. That is a serious reason. - It is horrible. - What? I wouldn't be able to look at the body. - God day. - Good day, madame. - What's new. - Nothing yet, but inspector should come soon. - Nothing about my husband? - Alas, nothing. - He is hiding somewhere. What is he hoping for? - That real murderer will be found soon. - Did they found who is Van Berg? - No. Mystery. But I think the key is in it. Tell me who is Van Berg and I'll tell you who the murderer is. Is that true, mademoiselle Susanne that you spent your vacation in Holland? In Maitre's absence I am responsible for the notary. Work...work! For a few words... Why did you dare to say than that you love me. Because it is true, madame. Incredible...You offer your flat for my dates and yet say that you love me. You do anything when you love. Your generosity is suspicious. I prefer to be suspect instead of you being one. What does it mean? Somebody is coming. Quiet. Body identification is always hard... She recognized Nalestro without doubts. It was that young Italian, who appeared here three days ago. Alas, madam, there is no doubts now. But who killed him? - I am afraid... - You suspect Maitre Rocher, of cause? I see it your eyes - he disappeared, ran away. It means he is the murderer. - But I don't have enough... - What? If there is a suspect, clues can be found. - But my inner voice tells me... - What? You also have the inner voice? I see sometimes like a sweet dream how I could conduct this investigation without you. Ungrateful!!! What would you do without me!? - I was conducting the major investigation! - You don't have a right to conduct an investigation! It's my job! And I vote for armatures. I should put you in jail. You would squawk there. - Rusty forehead! - Damn hen! What's happening? I want to know! I just got the information that Nalestro knew some secret... That's was his death sentence. He phoned to his friend, a lawyer and told him that he got himself into a trouble and that he needs an advise. He didn't mention any details. He also said that he wanted to come to the notary to share something with Maitre Rocher. But somebody is expecting him with the knife at the staircase... Nalestro is dead. There is a question before the murderer... What to do with the body. He opens the small door with the second key and pulls the body into Maitre Rocher's room Coming back, Maitre Rocher discovers his wife's lover's body. So here he is... innocent person, decides that he has to dispose body right away. and also to collect his wife to go with her to theater. He tries to open the door - doesn't work. There is a key form the other side. Maitre panics. He has to act faster. The only exit is to pass through the office. But there to his misfortune, there is mademoiselle Alice. What is there to do? She has to be off the scene. But how? Knowing that she faints easily, he decides to frighten her. He attaches the knife to his back, and acts as a dying man. Mademoiselle Alice didn't have visions. She did see Maitre Rocher,... not dead, but pretending to be dead. Finely! As he expected, mademoiselle Alice faints No he can carry body out without troubles. He takes it to Swan's island, and an hour later appears before us healthy and in one piece, completely disproving the entire story. The receptionist becomes a butt, and the investigation turns into vaudeville. But! He didn't consider that he deals with mademoiselle Alice, With Megre in skirt. She finds the key and the button, and the investigation goes on. Maitre Rocher is scared and he steals the clue from her. But he gives himself out saying that he saw Nalestro dead, he disappears, thinking that he is considered to be murderer. And at this time the real murderer is free. But Maitre Rocher is Innocent. Riri, you are a genius. - Should we let him out? - Where is he hiding? In my apartment, in the wardrobe behind my old dresses. Freedom to the innocent, ah? Door #8, first floor. From left to right. He is innocent. I always knew it! You were hiding Maitre Rocher since yesterday? He told me everything and everything happened exactly as you described! You hid the witness and didn't say a word? You, who chatter all the time! I speak when I want, or when it's needed for business. But when I'm told to shut up instead of saying something that I need to say and I don't speak, I am silent than I don't speak at all! Well, mademoiselle Alice, you excelled all expectations. Mouser inspector, I found Maitre Rocher. Inspector, I ask you to forgive me for my disappearance. - It's all my fault... - Let's forget about it. Everything is in harmony now...Everything is balanced. I am guilty too... I ask for forgiveness also you, mademoiselle Alice...I frightened you so much. It's all right. I have a good story to remember. - Forgive me for stilling you button. - I knew it was a man's hand. I have to say it was quit a brave act. You can't fool me! You hear, damn Riri! You can't fool me! Viva police and me! I took a short course of magic and foretelling, while seating in the wardrobe. When were you born? - In March. - Beginning or end? Middle. Why? You are lucky. Next year is a year of Pig, it is your year. You will be well off you will be promoted and healthy. You should meet New Year in the bright but not new suit, with close but not new friend. After clock strikes twelve it is very important to swallow acorn, scratch your year, grunt three times and step on friend's foot. New Year will bring you new adventures, mademoiselle Susanna, change of your attitudes but you have to restrain your temper, that's what horoscope says. Everything is simple with you - you will have a raise. And I promise you that. That's worth celebrating! You, Robert, will change your apartment, but in whole...this isn't your year. Be careful. - What about me. - Female fashion will change... that will take all your time. Also you will be divorced. - But I am not married yet. - You will have enough time for both. - Klara, my dear, Pig year is also your year. - What do you mean, dear? We'll talk about it home. The subject is to delicate and pleasant for us both. Just one minute, I'll take my things. Maitre...Do you need anything else? - Oh, I do...I need your devotion, your effort. - You can always count on it. You cry again, even when you being treated tenderly. I am such a sensitive person, that always ruins me. Maitre, don't you think that my salary doesn't match my skills? I do, I do...I can't let you starve, that would be cruel. I have only one request for you - don't come to work late next year. It's too much for me, but I'll try. Maitre...I didn't express myself in this story in any way...I was in love with your wife. - Don't worry, it wasn't mutual. I am resigning... I'm not taking your resignation. Workers are divided to two categories, Some can't do anything, others can do everything. I prefer the second. I am satisfied with your work. See you in the new year, I wish you the best. To our holiday. I would prefer not to see him any more That's why I let Robert stay, now he is harmless. Ladies and gentlemen, in a couple of days you will be invited to police to testify... See you in New Year. And I would like to drink to... the new clue. - Dear Klara, we have dreamed about cruise for so long. Isn't it time to travel? - With pleasure. Don't forget to send me a card, proving my raise. I wish you the best, mademoiselle Postic. I was glad to meet you. Maximin, I have a delicate task for you. Should we continue drinking coffee? - In different cabins, my dear? - Better in different oceans. Would you stick mustard plaster on my back? Me?! With pleasure. Are you staying, mademoiselle Alice? Yes, I need to clean up... Wait...So who murdered Nalestro after all? Explain to me finally what's your plan. - Quiet, quiet! Tell me did Maximin leave? - Yes. - In police car? - Yes, yes. Terrific! It means they think that I am here alone. So what else did you come up with? You just chirped something into my ear. Riri...I created the case, I conducted the investigation... I protected the innocent... And I will catch the murderer! Which way? Do you remember my toast? "To new clues." So there...It is the lure...which the murderer should bite. He will come back now to kill me. Do you see? The witnesses have to be finished off! So...Riri, you will be my witness and...a guardian, right? - Of cause! - Hide. Mademoiselle Alice, you are inventive and brave! No, my dear Lili, I can't let you risk yourself! You said "Dear Lili" or I misheard it? There is a moment in life... Seducer...If you didn't have a wife and five children I could consider... Be serious! Do you have ideas? Is it man or woman? If madame Rocher was able to prove that her husband killed her lover... She would become free and wealthy, but... will she have enough courage to come back here? I'll explode on your stove! I beg you don't sneeze, be quiet as a mouse. Are you asleep? I beg you don't sleep, otherwise after you wake up you'll find...my dead body. Are you asleep? He's coming. Oh! You are still here, mademoiselle Alice?! I had to come back for the umbrella. Bad sign, but what can I do? Strange...There is no umbrella... Maybe it's in mademoiselle Susanna's room? No. I don't understand...Did you see my umbrella? - Maybe it's in Maitre's room? - Maybe... No umbrella anywhere! Mademoiselle Alice, could you lend me your umbrella? With pleasure, but it's very small and covered with flowers. No...not with flowers... What a weather we have today, ah! Yes, the weather...What's wrong with the weather? corresponding the circumstances. Which circumstances? Inspector just left. I wanted to tell him such an important thing. So what did you discover for the investigation? - You won't tell anybody? - No. You know, when I met Nalestro downstairs I spoke to him for quit some time. Do you know Nalestro? What an idea! So no? You know he was a very nice young man. Though he had such an ugly scar. Across the whole face. I advise you to be silent about it. You mixed it up again. Nalestro didn't have any scars. How do you know? You murdered Nalestro! Of cause...More than that, it was me who introduced him to madame Rocher. I knew that they would like each other, I even offered them my apartment. And you blackmailed him? - I was going to reveal his name to Maitre... - For money. But Nalestro decided to go around me. I had to finish him off and deliver his body to the dearest patron as a Christmas gift. To finish the lover and the husband with one stroke. Later you make two or three compliments to the lady and you are the owner of the notary. - Not bad, isn't it? - Beautiful... It would happen exactly this way, if it wasn't for you... dear Alice. You have a very long tongue to stay in this world. You will dare to strangle a woman!? Alas, I don't have other choice. You locked the door! - Brake it, Riri, brake it! - Doesn't work! Good old building... Yes, new building would collapse right a way... Open! By the name of law! Shut up, bold pig! You'll be next. - Look, police! - That kind of jokes is for you stupid inspector. Hands up! - Do you talk to me? - I talk to you. I'm opening, Riri. Come out! Did you die? What's that? Robert, is that you? You are so beautiful, when you are silent. After this case you'll be promoted to commissar. -Maybe... - Definitely. I'm taking him, chief? Maximin has steal grip. We shouldn't be in his way now. What a joy it will be for you wife and five girls. You see Lili...You have done such a thing for me... that I simply can't... I have never been married, and I don't have children. Why did you lie to me? You know, it's weired to be bachelor at my age. Do you remember that time in "Blue Ostrich" you promised to marry me? Is that true? My memory betrays me... No, you betray your memory. You disappeared for twenty years. I was waiting for you so badly... I almost got old! Slap in the face! On duty! Listen...This music...It seems... Yes, this music played in "Blue Ostrich". This is my favorite. Twenty years ago we didn't finish our dance. Forgive me. Georgette... It is great that you phone. I'll tell you such a story, you'll die. I am resigning from the notary and becoming a private detective. Yes, I will work with inspector Grandin. He proposed to me and I said "yes". What kind of...can I make? Even a man can become a human with a good woman beside him. Alice - Sofico Chiaureli Grandin- Leonid Kuravlev
