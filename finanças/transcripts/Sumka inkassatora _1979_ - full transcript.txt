Collector's bag. Sergeant Mikhailov. The situation is not broken. Proceed. There was a strong fire. Surely arson. Yes, probably. One holster is missing a weapon. - Which one? - The one in the back seat. Salon and corpses have traces of strong thermal exposure from collection bags. Only metal parts remained in the ashes. Ivan Trofimovich, I'm sorry that I raised you. What happened? Attack on a collection vehicle, who brought the proceeds from the airport. Collectors are killed. The car burned down. I would not bother you so early. So. Did you block the highways? Of course. Highway, train station, airport. And nothing? Nothing. Well. And the collection service has arrived. There is money. Were! Turn on the lights. Sit down. Well, is there any clue? There is something. When the car caught fire, it is already. It was, but a relay signal. In the collection service was not. and one of the collectors did not have a pistol. It’s strange. Very strange. Well, what do you think collectors themselves tried? Hard to believe. But if they have nothing to do with it. How could this all happen? That's it. A unique case. Collectors are reliable people. But this version cannot be ruled out either. After all, what happens. Do not have the right to stay. And they stood. The signal should have been given. Not filed. The car caught fire inside the cabin. And how is anyone there? Could penetrate? If a stranger, they shot. Oh well. Who do I send the case to? I think Tulikov. Sanin. I'm afraid that Sanin is too smart. But Tulikov is not tricky. Well, let's charge both of them. Sanin will be appointed senior. I’m listening, Ivan Trofimovich, but I I hope you know ... I know, I know. Just think, do not like each other Durga. Give them one of the young ones. You are free. So hold on. This, what else? The contents of the cabin. Cash collection machine. Take it, yours. What is here? All here. And most importantly, money. All airport revenue. Chemical expertise, spectral analysis. Yeah, exactly. Took us into circulation? . Yeah. Hello. Yes, come in, please. Who is it? This is comrade Ustinova. Assigned to ours. Investigative Brigade. Initials? I'm sorry, what? Initials. M.I. So Ustinova, immediately apply. To archive management. The version of the pyrotechnic device is not ruled out. Urgently needed. All data on these devices. Explosions. And technicians. Yes, by the way. Write. Sanin AA Yes, Tulikov is listening. Ah ... I bought a ticket, but I didn’t fly out. So. Ponamarev. Give an urgent wanted list. So far in the region. You told me something .. He said yes? There is nothing. Ustinova! Ustinova. M.I. , So? Yeah. Tulikov A.P. Sanin A.A. I'm always lucky. That I would not do this business. Would teach at your institute. I would set off. Although not. I wouldn’t. And you would cry. Do you have tears? I do not know. I know that. They are coming. You have such a face. Wait a moment. Cheekbones emphasize three points. Eyes. And lips. It is necessary to study the face. It can tell about a person .. Before a person speaks. I know that. Theory of Lanbroso. At the institute they said that she was vicious. Vicious? Yes. Well, maybe. In general, you need to extract from everything. Rational grain. For example. Palmistry. Palmistry .. Well, give me your hand, now I .. Do not. OK then. Okay. I AM... Here is the spectrogram. In your case. Look at her. On the screen on the table. So .. But these lines? Why such a scatter of them? Well ... one metal also has a spread. From various impurities. And there may be different metals. Different metals .. Look, it’s better seen here. In the photograph. Inside the car. There are metal parts. From the upholstery itself. Metal. Yes, and devices. Metal device. This .. So it means. An explosive device, right? Well, we can answer this question. Only if there is a sample. Good. There seems to be a sample. I was not going to fly anywhere. I'm afraid of planes. Do you understand? I'm afraid Deputy then you bought a ticket? At the aeroflot agency? Well, how much should I repeat to you? I did not buy. Did not buy. Is the passport information on the ticket spine? I do not know. I did not buy a ticket. And he didn’t give anyone a passport. Can I see your passport? There he is. I was really scared. Ponamarev. How to explain? That you came to our city. Settled in a hotel. "Космос". Then. Took a ticket. On the plane. Direct flight to Tbilisi. But they did not fly out. And then, the next day. Suddenly we left by train. In the Eagle. What does it mean? In my opinion, nothing. And in my opinion. Even a lot. Well.. Do not want to be. With us frank. We will arrange an identification for you. There are traces of glue. Can I? Well? In place of this photograph, another was pasted. And what kind of glue the devil knows. Probably ordinary, office. I'll tell you tomorrow. Cashier of Aeroflot agency, Nevzorov. One of these people. Did you buy a ticket? In Tbilisi. No. Definitely not them. Well, I would remember those. And that one is .. Well like that. Looks like you. Muggy such. Citizen Nevzorova. Take a closer look. No, not them. You excuse us. Comrade Ponamarev. You understand that. Such a job. Look at the image. The oval is not like. No. Pay particular attention to the nose and eyes. Eyes do not seem to be alike. And now? Take a look. The nose is not like. But this? Also no? No. So. And here? Yeah, it seems like. Looks like it. Hello. It is he. This is for sure. Why did I remember him. I say no tickets to Tbilisi. And he says, come on, come on. I urgently, to me for a funeral. But there is no certified telegram. Many thanks. You are free. Bye. I will accompany you. From them to. But this is the collector Elizarov. Need to install. Have you taken pictures? Recently, this collector. For documents? But he didn’t have this weapon in his holster. Yes, with him. I wanted to run. Prepared a fake passport. He died. Maybe he is. In general, take care of this matter. Collectors are reliable people. Their past is impeccable. And such people. Perished. Wonderful people. After the funeral, we’ll go to the airport. But not for long. Still, I need widows too. At the memorial service. I need to travel with collectors. No. It's impossible. In the car there can only be collectors. Only one collector. even you here .. We have no right to take. Unless by order. And never before. Not mom. Not a victim of a road accident. Not even policemen in uniform. And if the traffic police inspector stops? No. Should not stop. So, you can’t stand and still stood. And even the relay signal was not given. Why? And it could happen that the collector forgot to bring a weapon? No, this is impossible. Before each departure. Checked for weapons. What do you think? Could there be a pyrotechnic device in the car? No, it could not. And yet it turned out. If you knew. Those you suspect. You would understand everything. I need personal files. ABOUT! So he got it. Air ticket for passport of Panamarev. Hmm, in a photo studio on a passport I took a picture. He didn’t have a pistol in a holster. One to one it turns out that the criminal ... Zarov! Collector Elizarov. Nothing works out for us. That is, how is it? One to one.. Here are the evidence. No traces of money were found in the ashes. But the aeroflot cashier identified him from this photograph. He was buying a ticket. How it is? But like this. Money did not burn out. They disappeared before the fire started. Not the dead collectors seized them. So someone else was. And if.. There was no money? Ahh .. Let's start small. They took the money, it’s clear. And it is clear that not without the help of one of the collectors. That means. Need to look for it. Traces of collusion. Or dating at least two. Alleged It's not about collusion. And in the fire. The suspected collector could not. To carry. Pyrotechnic device in a car like that. So that others do not notice him. So you have to think. Under what he could. This device is masked. Nothing, nothing, Petrovich. And take it. They can only do one thing. Collector's sealed bag. Only there were. Not money, but a hell of a car. Or... Another device. But the money remained. At the cashier. Collector Elizarov should have. Defuse others. To burn. The car. And cover the tracks. Wherein. He himself had to stay alive. He was preparing to escape. I got a passport. But.. Apparently the cashier did not want to have any extra witnesses. And so he set a different ignition time. Hence! We urgently need to take a cashier! And split it! You are a strange person, Petrovich. So good start. Take, chop. What to take with? With your logical calculations? There is no evidence. Will be. The cashier cannot all day. Keep with you. Pyrotechnic device. Will not dare. And time on the clockwork. It was necessary to deliver. So we are looking for evidence at the airport. Pure logic. Pure logic. Ok, look with your logic, and I’ll try to interrogate the dead collector. Hello. Hello, there are no places. Are you reading? I read. Have to come off. Well well. And what? Is anything missing? I have to check, mm .. All surnames of those who checked in twenty from the fifth to the twenty-sixth of September. Twenty sixth? This is when collectors burned out. You are welcome. So where can I get you? Ah ... here. Yeah. Do you think the car was hidden from us? What kind of car? Well.. I mean writing. What are you doing tonight? AND? Your luggage will be stolen. Yeah. Clear. I know this Chebotarev. He lives on my site. Until recently, everyone was throwing complaints at me. He complained about motorists. They say they are blaming, they do not give him sleep. Until recently? Yes sir. And recently, how to fix it. Near private traders is spinning. He knows the prices for cars. Caught with us in theft. The truth is shallow. Fucked off. One minute. Oil again. Have you been drinking already in the morning? Well done. Well, let's get through. Let’s go, let’s go. Well go, go, do not be shy. They told me at your work that you are on the ballots. Let’s call. Find out what you are sick with. Check it out. So the cashier. Seduced Elizarov. So you, Petrovich think, right? Meanwhile. The connection between them is very doubtful. So I took a medical card. Collector. You just look. How many years a person worked in one place. And not a single disease. Even a cold did not take him. I played tennis. Tennis. At first I was surprised. And then he found out that you need to play sports. Well, he did. And why, he does not care. Here is his autobiography. Just look. No overclocking. No squiggles. So, standard handwriting, except for. Grammatical errors. No, such a person could not. Be a criminal. Because it is devoid of the slightest passions. Well. And all your science. It can not be a criminal, but the facts. They say different. Well now guess. On coffee grounds. Yes, I'm listening. Which model? 03 WHA. Chebotarev. And how long? Three days ago. So. Thank. Well. It’s necessary to do business. And I'm doing business. Here you are saying. He killed his own. And I ask myself. How? How could he do that? How can he kill his comrades with whom? Worked for so many years? Can you answer that? Well it could be. It’s interesting to you personally. And for business. For business. Important evidence. And what? How? This is fiction. So until we find out. What and how seduced Elizarov. We will not know who was his accomplice. Uh .. If only that. Do not suffer. Wait until tomorrow. Here we take it. Cashier. He will tell you everything personally. Hello, can I come in? Girl. Put the doll down. Will you come back soon. Daughter, let's go soon. My little. Let's go to. Please make room. Check out the sofa. Get dressed. Yes Yes. Sorry. I forgot. How many counted when it happened to me. I forgot. Please forgive me. Get dressed. Yes Yes. Get dressed here! Yes of course. Here. I forgot. I forgot. You can not wear a watch. Well, why are you like this? Sorry, please, by accident. Lieutenant, give her some water. Chebotarev. I warn you again. Only sincere recognition ... I I understand, I sincerely repent. And I confess. Where is the rest of the money? Sorry, I repeat to you again. Everyone has it. The cashier has his own collection bag. In which he adds the proceeds. And then the collector arrives and collects all proceeds from all cashiers. This is the total revenue of the entire airport. But that evening when the collector arrived, for some reason he didn’t take the proceeds from me. I did not know what to do, I was confused. He left. I did not want to appropriate this money. But then he decided, let them lie down until tomorrow. And tomorrow I found out. That the car burned out, the collector burned out and all the money burned out. I was scared because. I carry this money, they think that I .. Involved in this. I .. While I put them in the savings bank. Wait. You are welcome. Yes, Tulikov is listening. Well, how is it? Checked, huh? So what? Ah, six thousand. That's for sure? Oh well. Where is the rest of the money? I told you, I had to turn in only six thousand. Well, let's say. Well then why did you need to? Destroy a car? What car? I didn’t destroy any car. Sit, sit. This is a misunderstanding. I have nothing to do with the car. Not true. After all, you will not deny. Chebotarev. What a day. Before the attack. You are handed over to the locker. Pyrotechnic device. I did not hand over any device. it some kind of misunderstanding. Some kind of nonsense. Some nonsense. So six thousand only, right? Six thousand. Have you signed up for a car? Was recorded. And if you have only six thousand. That's why you signed up for a car. Which costs seven five hundred? They didn’t write to another. And you didn’t have money for this, right? There was no money, that’s true. There was no money. Chebotarev, and why exactly? You? Did not cash collectors take revenues? Well, how do I know? Maybe some kind of accident. Are there too many accidents Chebotarev? That did not take the proceeds. It is with you. Pyrotechnics passed. It is in your name. They stole six thousand. They wanted to buy a car. For seven five hundred. Tell the truth. Chebotarev, tell the truth. Give me a drink. Yes. You are sorry. Our interrogation switched to night time. Who cares, I don’t spend the night at home. Petrovich? And when did you manage to interrogate him? Last night. In the evening? Yeah, well ... I started on time. Only then ... Good afternoon, San Sanovich. Good afternoon. I got carried away. Who gave you the right? Do nightly interrogations? Please note, Alexey Petrovich! Once again, this will happen again and I will demand so that you are severely reprimanded! I got carried away. So, everything is clear. The cashier has nothing to do with it. He was not at the crime scene. And the money was taken from the car. All the money. All airport revenue. That would mean someone else. Unknown to us. And a very experienced criminal. Which even bothered. About putting us on the wrong track. Tossed to us. Version of Chebotarev. But we already know something about him. Yes? What do you know about him? Yes. You. Urgently to Peshekhonov. That's what. Take care of the Cosmos Hotel. So. Cosmos Hotel? This is where Ponamarev stayed? Yes. Only the employee of this hotel. Could seize a passport. Living there. Pass passports. By the way, this is also not legal. Well, what are you staring at? Rita. Well, what about the hotel? Your possible criminals are pretty sweet. One is even beautiful. The Cosmos Hotel has three interchangeable administrator and all women. Rita. Ritochka. Okay. We'll keep thinking. We'll keep thinking. This is not what worries me now. What about? Your tone. Still, we work in the same group. We must have a healthy climate. What climate are you talking about? You. Who are you. Who threatened to reprimand Alexei Petrovich. Do you understand? What about? We punish people for breaking laws. And we ourselves will violate. But we break for the cause. Clear? Wait for me here. I am now. Thank. Well, why are you silent? So you agree that formalities should not interfere with the matter? You see whether the criminal is a handicap, and we are limited by law. Yes, limited! And it's good that are limited! Handicap. Night interrogation is a suppression of the will of the accused! We are placed in a tight framework! The law, because we decide the fate of man! And everything is done in order to ..! In order to .. It was difficult to decide this fate. Thank. Do not get dirty. I need to hear your opinion. You have a fresh eye. The thought haunts me. About one person. You know, I ... led one thing. And with a bang he lost it. I’m always haunted by the thought that this ... The work of one and the same person. A thirst for revenge. Bad Advisor. And you are not burdened. Past mistakes. By the way. Tasty ice cream. I have to eat. It gives positive emotions. And what, here. As they say, money goes to money. Good luck to luck. Positive emotions to positive emotions. Anyway, everything is fine with us. Two versions have disappeared. And we are on the right track. Sit down, Ustinova. Ustinova. You are all doing techies. Viewed? Of course. And in what archives did you look? In the archives of the Department of Internal Affairs. ATC? And in the archive. Ours? Watched? No. You will never succeed. Sensible investigator. Well, who is looking like that? From these to these. Did not guess. What could be. Discontinued cases that are stored. In our archive. Now, if you had guessed. And what, in fact, Alexey Petrovich happened. I just got the info. What is free from techies. There is only one person. Someone Borisov. So, so what is this Borisov? What? What .. Go ahead. Even happily. Works. In the landscaping trust. Sells flowers. And seven years ago, this same Borisov. A homemade pyrotechnic device was seized, okay? No, it’s not clear. This business Sanin led. And he stopped. Now it is clear? The angle is eighteen. The third experience. ANGLE twenty-three. The fourth experience. ANGLE twenty-five. The fifth experience. Three meters. Hello to the prosecutor. Has anything happened that you yourself have granted? Yes here. I came to consult. Well, come on, come on. At the expense of the gun. Which one? If only I knew. You see. A pistol disappeared from the collection vehicle. And .. Well, it’s natural to assume. What they used. But there are no traces. This cannot be. Give me a sleeve or a bullet and I will tell you I'll tell you the whole life of this gun. There is no sleeve. No bullets either. So they didn’t shoot. Or maybe used for other purposes? Well .. A grip on the head. No, there are no external traces. Only fire marks. Ah ... And the inner ones? Domestic? Well, what can be internal? If there are no external ones. A bullet will not enter without a hole. Uh ... But we have a mouth. Nose, ears. Natural holes, so to speak. The gun could also be a gas one. Citizen Elizarova. Where is your husband’s weapon? What? Where is the weapon? I began to hear poorly. After Vityusha was killed. I hear nothing. Just a scream. Screaming all the time. Where is the gun? At home. Home gun. Like at home? What? I'm sorry, I can’t hear. Ka Vityusha was killed. I hear nothing. Hmm .. A long time ago the gun at home? AND... No no. You know, this always happens. Vityusha said, but who needs it? And he lied. I took with me. I didn’t take it once. And so. They killed Vityusha. Well. According to the instructions one. But in reality, he was carrying a gun home. Tell me, what about your husband? Did you make anything? Well, what was he fond of? Nothing. He had no hobbies. So. I'm with you. No, you are not with us. You are on your own. Do you have a private investigation? So you have to understand? What is it with him, huh? Let's eat, huh? How are you going? You will work or you will only. To reason? And what? Here, by the way, is the news. Here. Examination established. What are collectors. Poisoned by nerve gas. So you have to reason. From a gas gun. Shot Elizarov. Well, then I arrived. Leader. AND.. Withdrew the money. Put the device. Question. How did Vityusha go about this? Well. Probably stupid. Is he a fool or something? Well, you never know what could seduce Elizarov. Providing him a departure. Good. And where is the guarantee that he .. Tempted? But will not let us know? Think blackmail? Anything from the past? No, their past is carefully checked. From the present. He has a space, vacation. Will you eat? There are five minutes left before the break. What is the matter with her? M? So interesting.. So of the techies at large, Borisov alone? Yes. But this is that person. On which Sanin was blown up. Well. He is still cautious. And time is running out. Maybe interrogate the administrator. Cosmos hotels? Ponamarev’s passport is serious evidence. Frighten off. Yes, not that person Borisov. To leave witnesses behind. What are you offering? Why are you silent? Yes, you can’t rush! It is necessary to establish observation of Borisov. And do not take it. And if you take it in the act. And then, this is the case of operatives. I'm going. To Moscow and Gagra. I need. One hundred percent evidence. Time comrades, time. Why go to Gagra in vain? It is better to immediately interrogate the widow of collector Elizarov. What for? Well, if there was something on vacation. She knows. Well, not every wife knows. What her husband does on vacation. Igor Andreevich. You do not know her. Not seen, but I saw. This one knows. Hello. Good afternoon. Comrade Vanin? Sanin. Yes Yes. Sorry. Have you brought anything new to us? Yes and no. Generally.. Let's .. Well, show, show. Homemade mine? Maybe. Here you have it. At the display window. Homemade in the case of Borisov. I want to know if not one master’s handwriting? Comprehensive examination. Comparative study. Yes. Comrade Vanin. Sanin. Sorry. Sanin. Do you really not. Other evidence? Science is my hobby. Only I believe her. Hm. This is because you are her. Do not do it. I was told that you know everything here. I have a business for you. Yes of course. You are welcome. So. What can you say about these two people? This is Elizarov. So. And this is Yuri Petrovich. Horticulturist, high collector. So. They are playing. Together, huh? Yes, usually together. Yuri Petrovich plays the second category. Elizarov does not know how to play. He plays badly. Still played? Yes, they did. Yuri Petrovich sometimes happens, And Elizarov. Not been already. Month. On the court. Yeah. Clear. Anything else you can say? Just so your husband could not commit such a crime. Something happened. Extraordinary. You must help us. So what happened? He did not speak at first. But I myself noticed. That he came back some wrong. Lost completely, and .. Before the deadline. I told him to declare. And he supposedly put. Well, they decided to keep silent. So what happened? He met a friend there, drove a car with a friend. And what is the name of a friend? He did not speak. Friend. Friend. Once. were in the evening in the restaurant. A friend drank a lot, he says. Get behind the wheel. Let's eat so dear that we will not meet the traffic police. And Vityusha was almost sober. He didn’t drink from me. Almost did not drink at all. Just a little bit. Let's go. Suddenly there is such a sharp turn. And man. Vityusha pressed the brakes. But everything happened in a second. I felt a blow. And a man flew under a cliff. Vityusha says it should be stated. A friend answers. Better go straight to jail and go. Well, they left. What is the name of a friend? Did not say. And I didn’t ask. My! Enough for today! All! All! But why?! Or maybe revenge? AND? No, next time. But why? No time, honey. I can’t do that, Yura. I want to know why? I have things to do. I'm sorry. Till. Citizen Kovaleva. You are detained. Come along. How long have you known Borisov? For ages. Well, more precisely? Or rather about a year. About a year. Kovaleva, I suggest you tell the whole truth. It will be easier for you. What is the truth? What are you saying? Are you suspecting me of anything? Yes. In what? In connection with Borisov. Yes, but what is criminal? I am free to love whom I want. Ksenia Nikolaevna, you perfectly understand what I'm talking about. I do not understand. Oh well. How often did Borisov call you? Rarely called. And you? Never. Why? Because I never call men at all. So. Ksenia Nikolaevna. You are a very nice woman. Your face inspires confidence in me, but the facts ... Facts speak differently. You see, I don’t know what facts you are speak, therefore it is very difficult for me to speak. Oh well. Did he visit your hotel? Ah ... Well, of course I have. Did he replace you? In place of the duty administrator. No, no, never. Never? Never. And if you think about it? Two times. I was away. He asked me to buy. Wine and food. Because everyone knows me and it is much easier for me. So still replaced. Well, the only way. And when was the last time? It was about a week or two. Back. And after that? He tried not to see you? Have you met him? To me then. Somehow it did not occur to me to compare these facts. What do you want to say that he is something stole from us in the reception? Well no. This is just nonsense. Urgently find Sanin in Moscow or in Gagra. And tell him that everything turned out. Collector in Gagrah. He hit a man. And this was blackmailing him. And he was engaged. Blackmail. Borisov. You just need to take it. Borisov and interrogate. Observation Now for him. Already installed. So, Ustinova. Science by science. But you need to work. First, second, third, go up to the fourth floor. Have to hack. Witnesses. There is. Both into the car. Be on the walkie-talkie. I obey. Call witnesses and experts. Good. The window is open. Where is the request? Now they will bring the supply manager. Yes, already brought. Let's get it here! We did not attach any importance to this occasion! Reported killed in the abyss. We looked closely, not a man but a scarecrow. They found out that they had sold to this supply manager. And they didn’t even punish him. Scarecrow is written off. What did they come to? On the Volga. So. Who came? Operational groups. The object at the station. The object at the station. I'm the fifth, I get it. Go. I understand you. Oper group to the station. At automatic left-luggage offices. What is hidden there? I have nothing. Sit down. Take witnesses. Open the cells. Open it all up. Well? Why are you silent? I look forward to hearing from general words to specific questions. Question. One. Do you plead guilty? And everything else does not need questions. We have specific facts. You have handed over your suitcase to a regular left-luggage office. In the name of the cashier Chebotarev. To. Record his last name. And give us the false version. You handed the collector a gas pistol to Elizarov. Knowing that in a confined space. There will be poisoning for everyone. You blew up a car. I think that we will not define. Did the money burn out. Therefore, there is one question. Do you plead guilty? How helpless you are. Well, what kind of detective story was told here? Well, maybe. Maybe the crime was in a very similar way. But what do I have to do with it? That is OK. Now we will find the money. And this is irrefutable evidence. There is something. They removed from the cell which he was going to open. Your suitcase? This is a briefcase and not a suitcase. Yours or not yours? I'm asking. Witnesses, come here. Special keys are needed here. Hack. No need to break. Here are the keys. Witnesses are free! Well. I don’t seem to need to answer to your only question. The facts answered him. Wait! The duty department captain Orlov is listening. Did you play on the courts? With the collector Elizarov. Well, and what follows from this? You never played with anyone. It's funny, the only evidence is that I played. Tennis with some kind of collector. And you forgot, Borisov, that seven years ago. An explosive device was seized from you. Analogy is prohibited by law. Sit down! Sorry, but every year I allow myself to relax in Gagra. Only this did not have time. There were. And they rode there with a collector. Did he say that? We know that. Well then, question yourself as a witness, once to you. Everything is known. Well, what's next? KPZ. But the law gives three days to detention. And then what? And then blame yourself. Not one prosecutor will not authorize arrest. And I will write about your activities to all authorities. Hmm .. Do I know pissing. Nothing yet. Continue to search. Throws! Open the sills! Come on. Ahh .. Nonsense. Kaha, go quietly. And then we, too, will fly into the abyss. Well you are not mannequins. How? Clean Air? Where did you bring me? Do not worry everything will be fine. Give a photo. So. The investigation is ongoing. I beg. You know, the prosecutor refused to authorize the arrest of Borisov. I know. And rightly so. Is it possible to arrest a person on some guesses and suspicions? Tomorrow release Borisov from the bullpen. And consider that Sanin and you are reprimanded. You know, Sanin has nothing to do with it. We are forced to release the obvious criminal. And only because of your haste. So. Alexey Petrovich. Like this. Listen up Why did you bring me here? On this road. Nowhere else. Only here you can sit. And drink Georgian real wine. Yes. Month ago. Together? On the machine. On the Volga. On the Volga, yes? Now they will be. Our witnesses. They saw. Your bandits. The mood is already different. Truth? You see, you arrested Yura. You suspect him. And he has no one except me. He loves me. I only now understood why. He stopped meeting me. He was suspected, he didn’t want to .. They also suspected me. I just Now I understand when I received the letter. Letter? Yes, he sent it a few days ago, but I only received it. Last night. Yeah. He's writing. That he is not to blame. What did he understand. What will the criminal look for. Remember the old. Inaccuracies. He may be arrested, and .. Sew a case. Excuse me for saying this, but I want you to understand. That he wrote a letter only to me. There is nothing, nothing. I understand. You see, he wrote a letter to me alone. He asks me to wait for him so that I do not refuse him. That time will pass, and .. well. Still, they will prove his innocence. And the most. The incredible thing is that he is afraid of losing me. Do you understand? And the letter, do you have it? Yes Yes. Could you give it to me? Of course yes. You are welcome. Maybe I can be something else useful? San Sanych. Hello. Hello. With the arrival. Here is another letter to the case. Hm. Interesting. Handwriting ambitious. And he writes compassionately. The problem turns out. Well, why do you think that in love ambitious people are not miserable? Come on. You never know. Take the car. So. And run to the fourth compartment. Dig all correspondence. From the day of the crime. Take all receipts. For parcels, parcels. I didn’t even pay attention to the stamp. I wonder what he did there on the outskirts of the city? Of course. You know, it’s fortunate that the car is old and repainted. Peeling paint is easier. And when you hit the mannequin. On the cloak. there was a tiny trace of nitro enamel. Here, look at the right wing. It seems to be nothing. At the back. Well, now we are. Paint. So after all, nitro enamel, she. It’s probably the same on all cars, only in color diverges. Well no.
