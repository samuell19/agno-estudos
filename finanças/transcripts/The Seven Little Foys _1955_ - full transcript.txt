George Washington was the father of his country Just like the other parents who can cite -There's the father Nickerbock -Who got us off the hook He should enter the hall of fame Let's talk good about the Whistlers' father And the father Hanson, the father of baseball But when I see my children lined up I see the world is mine because I am the greatest father of all Oh, what a beautiful bunch. We, the children, were a beautiful gang, yes. I don't know how the old man held up. I'm Charlie Foy, It's been a long time since I was the second kid to the right on stage. The one up front with our dad is Eddie Junior. The year is 1913 and that was our opening at the Palace on Broadway. The other dancing hurricanes are my brothers and my sisters, Madlyn prosecuted Mary Richard Brian. We children have finally made it to success. We prove once and for all that we are Show Business, It doesn't take talent, just courage. Fortunately our father had courage for all of us. Look at the shoes he is wearing. Dad was superstitious. In all those years on stage he never changed them. It was hard to believe that they were once young. But one day they were. The old ones got in Chicago circa 1898 when he was not loved, was not married, had no children, he was lonely and determined to stay that way. This is the story of his tragic failure to remain single. Ed, get back on stage. This was our father. A family man of old. Ed, what do you do in between the show? I'm going to play pool on Flatchstreet, women don't come in. When are you going to change your mind and go out with a girl? Talk to the wrong man, I'm Foy, professional bachelor. I don't carry weight. I don't say the same about you. Tonight. Barney Green is behind you to schubert's. Forget the beer and try to get back in time. I was never late. You don't know it, but you missed a big chance. Here, you need a drink more than I do. Did you see the number of the sisters? Direct from Italy. You should show them our ways. I'm not interested in dogs, women or children, in that order of importance. You'll make it, little sister. I trust you a lot. -But I don't trust myself much. -"Escaussie, sir." We couldn't get anyone to help us with our bags. We don't speak your language well. I would be so kind. -Parrer Idotch. -No. But I don't know how to say anything else. You thought I wasn't going out, did you? Badly educated, tyrant, ignorant... Stupid! Next time he will bring my suitcase. for what? He's just being tough. What's this about giving up my dressing room? I've been here for three weeks, they barely arrived. Two girls in that little hole next door and besides, they are dying to get married. �, you have to be a foreigner to be someone. N�o � irland�s? Sure, not everyone? Look, I told them I was going to talk to you. They don't speak our language well. Enough to get a poster. Why don't you get me a mirror without rust? It means that the answer is no. To almost all questions. Who is? I'm sorry, girls, he won't budge. And I did! america. No Italian should come here. Damn Crist�v�o Colombo. Mr. Foy has a Colosseum then we have to stay in that pizza oven. There is no place to hang our clothes. On here. What are you doing? Escaussie, sir. I'm looking for a closet. -Est� nele. -Madeleine! Just a moment. What you want? Let me do your makeup? -Let me do yours. -No, it's nothing. -Anything? -I have the balloon. And I'm like that all the time. No wonder Italy is overpopulated. Leaves! Get out! Hey! Where were you raised, in a public bath? -I wanted to help. -Outside. It won't do any good at all. You won't get that dressing room, whatever you do. I imagine it would. Give it away. -What a horrible man. -And I'm not even trying. -His face. -I know. It's all wrong. I fix. Wait a minute, I like it that way. The clown has to smile. In Italy we don't. El Besotarssi the Clown. He comes from Italy. I wanted you to come back. But what idea is this? Your mouth, like that. Ready. Now her face is happy. Inside you can be sad, unhappy, angry, nervous, whatever you want. But on the outside, he's happy. Thank you very much. You helped me a lot. Goodbye. You are so kind. We didn't bring ours. See you later. Hey! Wait a minute. I paid 80 cents for this pot. Well, on the outside you're happy. That night the sisters Living began to bring culture to Chicago. But Chicago wasn't ready for that. The impatient man in the box to the right was Barney Green, businessman, powerful, experienced... the finger of fate in celluloid clothes. I was there to see if a comic named Eddie Foy was ready to Broadway, but for an hour and a half he only saw a lovely and graceful ballerina. Eddie had waited a long time to go on stage in order to be discovered by Barney. It was going to be a rough night. Third encore and nobody is applauding. I told you to give up the dressing room. They've been on stage for so long that they don't need a dressing room. Hey Mec, what's Barney doing? I'm looking at the clock again. You have to watch the Majest show in ten minutes. Don't go away yet. He went that way. Hi, I'm Eddie Foy, I'm doing the next number on the show. I've been waiting my turn for so long that my material has already gone out of fashion. This pullet has been looking for a rooster for a long time if we help find it, we can go home. There's a rooster in the audience, so what are you waiting for! Nice to meet you, I'm the next number. You won't get a husband with that kind of music. Get off the stage or I'll rip your heart out! What will you perform in the encore, look what a beautiful song, play this one. Do you have a doctor there? She is on the move. Are you her brother or brother? Look, he's taking his morning shower. The rooster joins her. It only has a piece of soap. More water? Back off or you'll get wet. Opa! Play some on me. A little behind the wings. On the back. Face j�. Good thing we're near a lake. I caught him. Here come the hunters! Save yourself if you can! Foy, I'm a man of few words. I need one more comic. Majestic should be watching Ivete Gilbert right now. She's a smart girl. If you want, I'll give you my cabin. After all, I'm the guy who discovered Burt Williams. My life is to discover new talents. I found one more tonight. I could tell you stories. But I'm a man of few words and I won't say anything. I made this contact here for you. Shansiuri Garavita, duo of young producers. Zunick e Jake Schubert's, show novo, and $500 per week four-week warranty. I am a man of few words, I accept. Come to my office tomorrow with the girls' signature. girls? What does it mean: girls? the ballerinas. Those clumsy Italians. I was already worried about his schedule, so I stormed the stage. -That's it. We are not together. -Aren't we together? So why was I laughing? You think the Shugarts want a fool in loose pants. Bal, art, but that even I might like. You know what the secret of my success is. I have the poorest taste in Chicago. If I like it, anyone will like it, am I right? Must be. Who knows better than I what a show is. Who convinced the two Cohans to have children to transform into the four Cohans. -I turned them into a show. -Wait a little. Look, it's up to you. If you want to get to Broadway, this is the only way. Take the signatures, I'll take you to a wonderful restaurant. Let's celebrate with French wine and apple cookie. Like Mom used to do. Not your mother, mine. You laugh a lot, I should give the audience champagne. My sister was so wrong. It was a pity she didn't come. She doesn't trust you. But you just wanted to apologize, didn't you? That's it. You acted like a stupid pig and you're sorry, right? Well, I wouldn't say exactly that. You sent me flowers. Have you ever sent flowers to a woman? Yeah, I sent it to a trapeze artist once that fell off the tightrope. Everyone sent flowers. All the mainland men I've met are so kind. Civilized men lift their stomachs Voc� � acatavelmente vulgar. I knew I would like it. Champagne, flowers and offers your dressing room too. And from you is the supreme gesture. It was time to act like a human being. And I know why you didn't act like this before. I know your secret, Mr. foy. really? The tough, the bad, the cruel, Mr. foy. He was very shy. Have more champagne. I really like you, Eddie Foy. See? I'm not shy. A toast to the lack of shyness. Fill my glass again. That's what I call working fast. I just came here to eat a little. Here you are, here is the girl. I am a man of few words. Where is the signature. MS. Living, the late Barney Green. MS. Living, is seeing in me one of the biggest ballet lovers in all of Chicago, you might ask. But when Eddie gave his number what it needed, some funny tumbles... I knew that was it. You'll love working with the Schubert's. But who are these Schubert's? N�oh� Schubert's na It�lia? There must be a brother out there somewhere. It's going to be a big number, Foy and the Morandos. My sister is waiting for me, excuse me. -Did I say something wrong? -Said everything. With two bottles of champagne it was too early. Pay the bill. They! It seems! It seems! MS. living. I wouldn't catch a cold if I were you. Your sister cannot work alone. Very well, I had a contract prepared in my pocket for you to sign. Good thing Barney showed up. Take it slow, otherwise I'll let you get wet. I found that you are the type of woman I spent my whole life running away from. The kind of house in the country. Why, I don't need you, or your sister, or anyone else. I work alone. I'll make it to Broadway on my own. So far no one has helped me. Beware of these might, please, this outfit is rented. -Maybe one day a woman, yes? -Only for one day. -I feel sorry for you. -Why? The umbrella is mine. You are so empty. I just want my name on a poster. -Nothing else? -What else is there? The rest of the world! What has the world done for me? Have you heard the song I made for Elias Cam? N�o. When the rain clouds save life And for me there's nothing left but pain Who comes to relieve my aching head? Ningu�m. When winter comes with sleet and snow I feel hungry and my feet are cold Who gives me something to eat? Ningu�m? You already understand. I never did anything for ningu�m! I never received anything from Ningu�m. Never. And until I get something from someone One day I don't intend to do anything for anyone Never When I try and plan to stay as good as possible Who says, "Look at that handsome one"? Ningu�m. Ningu�m. The whole day everything goes wrong I go home looking for peace Who gives me a passionate kiss? Ningu�m? As soon as I got your message I came running. Did you sign the contract? Here it is. Do you have any open dates on the west coast? what? I have to get out of here quickly, before they know it. I'll be with puppies and kissing babies. It might just be Schubert's, great musical comedy, Broadway. Are you married? Sure. A wonderful woman. We celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary. 15 years with the same wife, 4 beautiful children. After work I go home all night. Is this worth it? I'll get you a date on the West Coast. Eddie went west without saying goodbye. Madeleine and Clara decided to board the first ship to Italy. So he ran away. It was the first time he was kind to you. Let's go back to Italy where there are dozens of young people who would give their lives to make you happy. "Grazia Dio" that we will never see Mr. Foy again. Let's wait and see... and then perhaps we will give "thanks to God". At the end of the summer Dad believed that a woman is just a woman. But a good cigar is better. Of course he's never smoked a good cigar in his life. Mr. foy. Why don't you throw that old cigar away? I don't play. Been in the family for a long time. But why not buy new cigars? Special price, two dollars a box. How much do you want to leave me alone? It's even a scoundrel, you idiot! -Hey! Can you read in Italian? - Of course I read in Italian. Read this to me. How did I meet a girl in Milano. Soon in Milan from all over the world. What does it say? She says in the letter that she is about to be married. Get married. Two months from now after you audition for a scale. -He's very happy because... -That's enough. he is a great boy. His father has a lot of money. -And she said she's going to have a lot of kids. -Shut up! She will live in Rome. She will be very happy, very happy on you. She is the luckiest girl in the world. She didn't write this, it's on me. -Is that all? -$1.90. That's enough for me, I've heard too much. São 11,229 km from São Francisco to Milan in Italy, between Scala and the Opera House, but my old man went there. Always pretending that I had just gone for a walk. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. -Ol�. -Sr. Foy. But what a surprise. �, I imagined it would be, � that I was passing through Milan looking for talent for Schubert's and decided to look for you. Very kind. You know, I just thought. Wouldn't you be interested in linking up with me? Call me? Yes, the three of us together. Bubblegum, you, me and your sister. Barney's already fixed everything. We can start at Bradway. I'm sorry, I have a better offer. Did Clara make you? No, a young boy. Did you get my letter? Yes, yes, it is very interesting. I kept the seal. And I'm getting married. Do Schubert's make a better offer? No, no. They can't. I understood. Are you staying in Milan? No, I'm thinking of leaving tomorrow. To tell you the truth, I started thinking about leaving tonight. -I am really sorry. -�. Well...continue the rehearsal. I have a better offer. When? Right now, before I remember the judgment. - Then tell me. - Say what? What any giovani coming la signorina when you want to make such a proposal. Frankly, I've spent my entire life avoiding finding out. I want to find out. Okay, will you marry me? Speaks as if ashamed. Say it so everyone can hear. for what? They don't understand my language. These languages ​​all women understand. What do you want? Blood? Yes. I want you to speak up. On stage, by Escala de Milano. Home of green Puccini, Memba. Para que I remember all my life -I must sing straw tch� right away... -If you wish. -Will you marry me? -Higher. -Will you marry me? -Why? why? How far do you want to go? Until you say you love me. I love you. Want me to scream louder? N�o. J� is so. I hope the Schubert's recognize what am I doing for them. They got married and spent their honeymoon on the island of Capri, in Revera. There was nothing my father wouldn't do for Schubert's. Two months later he took the number to New York. My suitcase, you forgot. Anything else? I have a free leg here. -Eddie! -Barney! -Eddie. -Ol�, Barney. My congratulations. Where have you been? Rehearsals started three weeks ago. It's my fault, Mr. Green. All my life I dreamed of a honeymoon in Capri. So we stayed. It was wonderful. -Rain, wind. -She was our guide. What a guide. We will. I have a taxi waiting. Just a minute. I still haven't examined all the luggage. Everything that comes from Italy has to be inspected. it's mine! It's all declared. Everyone says the same thing. What country is this here? America, panty inspectors, donkeys, idiots. Take this woman to any corner before they send us back to Italy. We wouldn't have so much happiness. Hey, wait! Don't push me! We have to hurry. I promised we'd all be at the theater in half an hour singing and dancing. Not my sister. -U! Why not your sister? -You have a child. What child is she with? Whose daughter? I haven't seen children around here. Madonna, as they say... she is pregnant. I don't care how you say it, you can't do this to me. I sent an advance. Why didn't Foy warn me? -Because we didn't warn him. -He must imagine. -No. -Why not? I don't trust him. Don't you trust him? His sister must trust him. Why do these things only happen to me? She is young, silly. I advised you not to marry this tramp. Your opinion. In Capri she told me she was going to have a baby. I asked you not to tell him. He will leave you, he will board a ship to America alone. -And I would be right, wouldn't I? -It would have come swimming. Let's go. Barney, I've spent my whole life waiting for this. -Prove it. -When is the show's premiere? When is the 15th of May the orchestra plays in percussion and you show up about nine months later. Explain this straight to me, I spent a lot of time out of the country. Too much time and with my money. You can say goodbye to Broadway. But I still haven't said hello. What do you know that I don't? I spoke with your European representative, I should talk to her every now and then, she's a mine of information. Mr. Foy, we're having a baby. I wanted to tell you, but Clara told me to wait. If you're interested, it happened on Capri. Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much to all of you kindly let me know about it. Any other news to give? It seems you know everything. And what will it be? Boy or girl? It will be an Italian. It's one thing we don't declare at customs. -Are you angry? -No. It's just not right to do that to a child, to have a father like me. Broadway is left behind. The baby arrived on the scheduled date. Dad named him after William James Bryan and Abraham Lincoln, Bryan Lincoln Foy. If this boy opted for Italian citizenship, he would have a hard time. One city after another as the months passed. My old man could be the last name on the posters. But he was still the first in the billiard halls. Money was providential, now that there was one more mouth to feed, besides Aunt Clara. Eddie, give Bryan the bottle. Sa�de. Come on, take it soon. I have a morning tomorrow. Don't push your luck, you're in that hitchhiking family, you know. Is milk coming out? -Capri. -Is there something wrong? All wrong. I was not born for this kind of service. I came to the conclusion that this boy is the last of the dynasty, there are already enough Foys in the world. - Didn't she tell you? -What? We are pregnant again. Midi-wake. To listen all week. Is it all you have to say? Does that mean nothing to you? Sure. We'll have to open another drawer. I'll tell you what, I'm tired of living in boarding houses. I need to try to fix myself in a show to try to install myself, stay somewhere. One day we will have a big house in the country. Grass, tree. A goat. How it was in Italy. When I talk about installing myself, I'm talking about an apartment at the Sherman Hotel. You will feel at home, having a bunch of old goats in the lobby. But what a life. How can you live with this gypsy? He only knows how to insult. I love it when he gets angry. You are angry all the time. How many women can love their husband all the time? This is the third pants that this boy ruins. So, do you want me to sleep in the drawer? Now it's too late. Aunt Clara insisted on baptizing her next child with the name of Giovane Victorio Emanoel. My father called me Charley. And I'm glad. Now there was one more mouth to feed, and Aunt Clara's appetite didn't stop growing. Dad had to become famous out of sheer necessity. And the strain was starting to bore him. I am tired I'm so tired the conversations always tire me I am tired I'm so tired I'm terribly C-A-N-S-A-D-O ANOTHER CHILD I am tired I'm so tired I'm terribly C-A-N-S-A-D-O Everyone has heard of the theater but for my father it was a private matter between him and Bryan. It means your father is famous. I don't want to see. It's the biggest show in Chicago history. I'm really, really into it. You will love it. I don't, I want more candy. What are you saying? Are you planning to enter the career? Come on, Bryan. I have to do my makeup. Let's go back to the bakery. Would you please come? Look. Bryan, look at me. The idea was not mine. Your mother made me promise that on your birthday I would bring you to see Foy and his Bluebeard. It's a success, all the kids in town come. You will sit in the little shell where you can see everything that happens. What better gift could you get? More bullet. How beautiful, very beautiful. Another inch to the right and there would be no morning today. Come on, Bryan, you're going to see Foy and like it whether you like it or not. I don't want to go, I don't want to go! I don't want to! I don't want to! Don't do that. SERVICE ENTRANCE Why, what an elegant little boy! Is he your son, Eddie? No, he is not my father. Come on, stranger. He didn't laugh like that when I was on the scene, wretch. Look! The theater is on fire. Socorro! Get my son out! Put the rope for him to go down. Stay calm. Up here, I want to come down. Bryan, sai! Pule, pule! N�o, n�o! -Daddy, help! -Come come! - Dad, Dad! -I'm a daddy now, right? Jack! Jack! Help me. Take good care of him, he called me father. -And you? -I'm coming down. Go, go soon! Go ahead, let's go! You know from frente! You know from frente! There is no danger! Calm down! Nobody runs from Foy's concert. Everyone walks away. Slowly, calmly, like this. That funny angel foot helped ease the panic. Saved many lives. Years later the old man spoke modestly about the incident. He didn't mention it more than two or three thousand times. After the fire, theaters were closed all over the country. But when they reopened, Eddie Foy had finally made it to Broadway. He was more a headline than a star. I did eight shows a week at the theater and morning at the Cathedral of S�o Patr�cio. Mary Helen Foy, go with God and may the Lord be with you. Am�m. Thank you, Father. I have yet to reach the second act. EDDIE FOY EM A OQU�DEA Madeleine Atonete Foy, go with God and may the Lord be with you. -Am�m. -Am�m. -Very punctual, Father. -Am I not always? EDDIE FOY IN GOOD MORNING THE GIRL Eddie Felix Foy Junior, go with God and may the Lord be with you. -Am�m. -Am�m. They should give Dad a multiple ticket. EDDIE FOY IN MR HAMLET ON BROADWAY Irving Foy, go with God and may the Lord be with you. -Am�m. -Am�m. Am�m. The holy water is running out, Father. Eight years later Dad took us for a walk in the countryside. We figured he was planning a mass murder. The ladies collect the sidewalks from here. Look, there are no sidewalks. When your father is kind enough to take us for a walk on Sunday... What else can you do? The pool hall is closed today. I thought we had kids and not a group of comedians. Oh, the fresh air. What a bonus. Breathe, breathe. Children shouldn't spend their lives inside a hotel. Here is the place they should be. And not on Sundays. Here in the middle of the woods? I've been asking you for years, but it's like talking to a wall. If I listened to you, I'd end up in a hidden house like that, shelter two corn sellers, away from the nearest beer glass. -More than beautiful. -That's what I thought. Come on down, I bought this house yesterday. What's up, daddy? Are you sick? Clara, a house in the country. What I always dreamed of. -What about? -It's falling apart. It's like someone I know. Breathe, breathe! It's too far away, I won't be able to see my friends. And I can't be happy here. That's great. We don't want that to happen. Italy is over there. Eddie, Clara is our guest. After 14 years it is already a tenant. Well, don't thank me all at once. I bet there are no girls for miles. If the problem is distance, it's years away. You don't come home much, do you? Why did you bring us to this house? Hey! The fence is broken. -Get out of the way. -It's good. Wait, wait! This has probably not been paid yet. I'm so happy. This is almost everything I wanted. I had to buy a birthday present. Today is not my birthday. Whether or not, this is the present. To floor. Thanks. Thank you. Now Clara has someone to talk to. Left tied up with no traces of the Foy family. -I never tied anyone up. -�, I know. I think that's why it worked. I was told that there were no women like you around here. I had to import one. I'm so glad I got through customs. I stole this from a small jewelry store in the Bronx. I know you will hate it. -An engagement ring. -I thought it was about time. Yeah, it'll be good for the kids to know we're engaged. I'm inexperienced, it's a little wide. I will return them. no! � the exact size. Easy, girl, or I'll have to buy a pair of rings. Well, I have to get back to New York. - Aren't you going to enter the house? -I've seen the house. Everything is inside, including shopping. I even ordered tomato paste. But where are you going? The people are going to give George Cohan a dinner. I have to be the master of ceremonies. If you're the master of ceremonies, maybe you'll have dinner with us someday. Thanks. Get down from there. -Adio, papa. -See you later. And a great morning to you all. That's why he bought the house, to hide us here in the bush and run back to town for fun. Wait. It's turning around. You better learn to count. Oh, Mrs. foy. And where is Mr. Foy this beautiful morning? Sleeping, of course. He arrived home at 4 am. Next time daddy comes to church. I promise. It always says so. If there weren't so much evidence to the contrary I wouldn't even believe there is a Mr. foy. The day he climbs these steps all the chimes in the city will ring in triumph. For that he must come. We saw very little of our father when he was playing on Broadway. Then he decided to tour with the latest success. Dad felt a little guilty and made a point of seeing us before he left for Boston. I will never forget that night. Adeus, Madeleine, Richard, Eddie, Bryan, Mary, Charley, Irving. Goodbye. -Who's the one waving? - is a friend of mom's. It wasn't his fault Boston Livet didn't stop in New Rochelle. And how could he know that Mom's cough Wasn't it because of the night chill? As time passed, Mom became very sick. The doctor was always at our house. Dad was still touring and knew nothing. I thought everything was fine at home. Every week a letter came from him. Aunt Clara took her to Mom's room. Mom never got out of bed. Where is he? -Where did the letter come from? -Tubuque. And there is this place Tubuque? Tobique. Why don't you write and say you're very sick? They can replace him. Why worry? How can you spend so many years with this man? A stranger in his own house, a visit for his children. Not a sign of what he feels. I know how he feels. -No need to modify it. -But it changes you. What does he say? 485 dollars. He still loves you. Will you try to call again? Is the number right? So keep trying. The line has been busy since my train arrived. There's something wrong at home. Having someone on the phone already means the world is coming to an end. Disconnect. You go home right after dinner. Surprise. How important is it for me to see George Cohan make another speech about himself? I didn't want to tell you, the speech is about you. You will receive a prize. Will Cohan hand me a prize? So let's run, I want to know who's going to point a gun at him. In all these years, the Pryors have managed to awards to many men of specialized talent. But no one has come this far in their field of expertise. And it's an honor to deliver to Eddie Foy This year's Outstanding Father Pryor Award. Thank you, Mr. Cohan, I know how painful it must be give a prize other than yourself. Never mind, Foy, I wasn't running for this award. Seriously. I wish I had 7 children to perpetuate the name of the Cohans. Since when do you need help? When an Irishman grows old, likes to have a family close to him. Do you know what I would give to adopt your seven children? Do you know what I would give you to adopt them? I know your children, I couldn't pay. At least you would have public, and you'll need it when Foy debuts in front of you com Zig Feld Colin. What new thing does an old man like you have to show the public? Zig Feld needs more than 100 beautiful women on stage. And what do they have to show me again? Oh, they know. But I'm not worried. Broadway Jones will still be running when Foy is just walking. When I got into the business, Cohan was already retiring. You heard the applause, didn't you? Every time you waved the American flag. After seven children you don't even lift it. Well, I'm still in top shape. Watch this. Let's see if the theater's oldest wonder boy does better. Clear the table, and get ready for the main number. Don't be scared. Get up here, Daddy. Help the old man up here. Harry, touch Yankee e don de ni. Don't you dances that weren't composed by Cohan? There is none. -Did you like it, Dad? -This won't replace dancing. Willie, take over the piano. A little song from Foy. Sweet, beautiful and original. How's that for an old man? Very old. Do you know my tap dance numbers? I know all the numbers you've ever seen. I did it first. And I did right. Professor, a Little Mary. -Hello, Father. -Goodnight. It's a little late, isn't it? �, the other people have already left. The other people? Mrs. Foy had many friends. Which is to say, I had a lot of friends. What's going on? She passed away this afternoon. What are you talking about? She's fine, I got a letter from her. - I was sick for many months. -Many months? Wait a minute. She would have told me. Excuse me, I'm trying to locate the husband. I am the husband. Now, I'm sorry, Mr. foy. So we finally met. I apologize to you, Father. -Clara, I wasn't even here. -As always. You should be happy now, you don't have to go home ever again. The father of the year. My congratulations. Who is? Ningu�m. Hi, Dad. Are you just passing through? COMPAHIA ADAMS Toys and sporting goods. Crian�as, eat, almo�o. Crian�as, behavior. Oh, boy, I'll get you. Ol�, Clara. O Eddie est�? This is a problem. He is. Look what he bought them, swing, seesaw. No one can punish, no one can beat, present, present, always present. �, he is trying to please his children, to conquer. Children, they spit on them. If I have the right, I'll take them all to Italy. Mary, Bryan, Madeleine, venham almo�ar. -I got you! -No, he didn't! -I got it! -Took nothing! -Hello, Eddie. -Welcome to cooking. Old Russ Bud got a really big crowd on Saturday, -I need to get back to activities. - It's better to get out a little. Want beer? Open the fridge and help yourself. If the fridge still exists. The autumn season is already closed. You haven't done anything for six months. I mentioned your name to Sam Harris and he said: -Who is Eddie Foy? -Who is Sam Harris? What are you going to do? spend the rest of your life watching your kids saw themselves in half? The moment I leave, Clara goes swimming to Milan with my children between their teeth. It will be better for them than that. What story is this? They have everything they want. They have nothing. If you don't want the beer, go away. I'm a businessman, I make a living listening to people yell at me. -That's living. -Hear what I say. You are playing a character. -I heard what you said. -I've never seen anything more disgusting. -in my life. -I know. -Go to work, Eddie. -I need money. -Go back to the stage. -What about my children? -Take it with you. -Come soon! -Those seven troublemakers? -I am going. It would be great, wouldn't it? Hi, Billy. Can you imagine what they would do in the hotel room while I was on stage? They would play the fifth floor maids. Take them to the stage. Divide a number. -It could? - That way you keep an eye on them. But I do musical comedy. I'm a big star. Not in this house. -Forget it. -I am a man of few words. Eddie Foy and the 7 Little Foy They're scheduled for the Pittsburgh Homecoming Theater in three weeks. I bailed. You sharpened it, do you expect me to believe that? -You don't catch me. -I do. What businessman scales a number without seeing it first? My brother-in-law. That's why I had to finance it. So tell him to forget it, the children will stay here where they have to stay. So I'm a man of few words and a lot of bad ideas. Certainly. What made me think since the Cohans did so well the Foys would do too. They had a father. Hey! I thought we would never be beaten again. Let's change the number. That night Dad tried to make us work. We sent Irving for reinforcements. Silence! It's time to get out of the loitering... to help support your father. -Here, here, this. -What are you doing with them? I'm giving them a once in a lifetime chance, Irving, get in there at the end of the line. -I don't want to work. - Neither do I. Everyone goes to work in the theater with me. At the theater, Dad? Stay here. Eddie Foy and the seven little Foys, what do you think? Hey! Why your name on the front? My manager is smart, that's all. Theater! But it is no place to raise children. - That's right. -And I will not tolerate it. Sit at your piano and earn your bread. -No, never! -Good, we're going to travel without you. Abalei a fera. -We don't want to tour. -I don't like this drug. I had to bring you here in the whip. Anyone from New Rochelle would be happy to get out of New Rochelle. Think of all the big cities we are going to see: Pittsburgh, Filad�lfia, Baltimore. We don't want to travel. -But you... -I see. You should not drive children away from home, school and friends. And I'm going to have dinner at the table. feel there, what do you need friends for? You are seven, They already have friends and enemies they need here as a family. And we also know who they are. Yes, and as for school, I will take a teacher with you. -What? -It will be like this, do you need to study? You only learned to count to seven to know how many there are. Look, keep it up, I'll have to count to six. Come on, back. Attention! First, let's rehearse the opening. And we will have to make a precise step with simultaneous stimulus. All Foys. Bryan, come here. Take a step with me up front. Play a little, Clara. Now, let's go. Look, look. -Who said you can dance? -You were the first. Sit down, sit down. Charley, try this step, please. Come here, follow me. Here we go, Clara. I don't know how to sing either. There must be some grain of talent hidden somewhere, they are my children, aren't they? They finally proved it. Let's go, I'll serve dinner. No, no one eats until we've done everything right. You are dying of hunger. What do we have here? A bunch of comics. -I tell the jokes. -Tell us when we eat. Slow down, someone here must have something more -beyond appetite. -I know how to dance. Keep your opinions to yourself. Mary and I sang. I knew it. I knew we had someone of talent here, you bums can roll while I present these two little girls on stage dressed in beautiful clothes. Gosh, the audience will say: Ah, those girls. Let's set up a number just with them. Come on, little dolls, the light is in you, do what you know and raise the public. There are smiles, yes, there are smiles that make us happy There are smiles, yes, there are smiles that make us sad There are smiles that dry the tears as the heat of the sun dries the dew Ah, I hope the power of the theater is not good. After that Dad started rehearsing us day and night. It wasn't enough. He showed us all the tricks he learned. In desperation he resorted to camouflage of seven children in a row, it would be a clear target. Irving thought he was too young to run, but Dad was determined. He wanted as many children as possible between him and the audience. We left for Pittsburgh, ready or not we should have stayed in the suitcase. We occupy half a sleeping car and an entire bathroom. Hey! I share on the side. Excuse me. Eddie view. Ready. This one is from Charley. Me abotoa, Eddie Foy. How do you do this? Let me do it. You are useless. Wait until there's no one around, then you'll call me. I do not stand in the agora. Everything in order? Well, I didn't find the soap, I don't have a place to shower -And there's a speck in my eye. -Home Sweet Home. What are you complaining about? I have to sleep in the attic. -What's the problem? -Do you mind? I care a lot. Why did you bring us here? Why, I thought my children would like to be with me. -Why? -This can be It's a big shock to you, but I'm your father. I know it was a big shock for me. You brought us. We don't have friends here, no toys or anything. Don't jump to conclusions. I sent Clara to bring everything for you, toys, books, shells. All all. - Everything? - Everything. And our goat? Didn't bring it, he doesn't like fish. So I didn't bring everything. I swear, I brought all the crap. I had to stop bringing three suits. Did you bring "my" doll? Of course, I knew this was going to happen. -Can you give it to me? -In the morning. -Oh, you didn't bring it. -Of course I did. It's in the trunk of the luggage car. I can't sleep without my doll. Yeah, but you don't want me to go out hunting in the baggage car in the middle of the night just to look for a... for... this is... they'd think I'm... I mean please... I... -Okay, I'll try. -Thank you Dad. if you only knew how to sing. Was this what you were looking for? Yes. Close your bags, please. Go. Sleep well. Here, I almost had to buy her a ticket. -Take it back. - Well, you didn't ask me to... I just wanted to see if you would pick it up. Good night. Good night daughter. You were very well educated. Hey, we're married. SUSIE HELENA CANTANDO BUKKER HILL EDDIE FOY AND THE SEVEN LITTLE FOYS Even Dad was scared to step on that stage. Oh no. None of that. Stay together, otherwise they'll come here to get us. More applause! You know, it gave me the most trouble rehearsing this number. Who is this? Oh, I know. wait. Stay out here with all of us. Very well, caprichem, make it look like a big number. Well, here we are. The entire family. That's right. If we move to Philadelphia, it becomes a city. � engra�ado. We have no other option but to start our number the way it is. Professor, let the tragedy begin. You know, if they weren't my kids I'd leave the theater. Why don't you go out? What are you looking at? It is not a place for children. Only children can be unpunished. I'm not at this show, I just came here to defend you. Now Mary and Madeleine will sing, for your elect, for mine it is not. Johnny Jump had a beautiful little boat And I wanted to take all the girls for a ride He had girlfriends on the beach Dozens of beautiful girls Johnny was very smart, you know? I was in a firm relationship with Flo every sunny afternoon he was going to date on the boat He rowed, rowed, rowed Upstream he rowed, rowed I held her arm and kissed her from time to time She would tell him when, start dating to kiss again Then he rowed, rowed, rowed and rowed some more Then he would drop the oars, date more and rowed, rowed, rowed To the boat! In front! Irving? Irving?! Irving? Get out now. Are you wanting to drown? -Don't change anything. -They liked? Just listen. They loved it, it's a hit. It's the worst number I've ever seen on a stage. -We're stealing money. -And I take 10%. He should be ashamed of himself making the bambinos out of clowns. �, j� we are quiet. Go back there, they're asking you to come back. It looks to me like they want blood. No, they loved it. Truth. All right, kids, let's go. -Hey, Dad! -What? - When are you going to give me a raise? -Oh, come back to the stage, please. After Pittsburgh, we went back to touring. Dad gave us a raise but made us pay for hotel rooms. So we made a point of signing the record. No! Even if we traveled very far, in the following months we could not get rid of the school. Dad hired a teacher that didn't even give us time to take off our makeup. So the earth really began, the next wind to blow from the north will bring to our ears the roar of resounding weapons. As we've seen on the battlefields. Why should we stand still? Let's see what we have. Won. ...to be bought at the price of the chains of slavery may the supreme God deliver us. I don't know what others will do, but as for me... I gave myself freedom, I gave my share. -Go! -Thank you. Thank you very much! Class closed. The next performance will be tomorrow afternoon. Can it be better than that? Not even Beth Pinheiro got so many bows. Isn't it better than New Rochelle? Of course, here they learn much more. I show you. Look there, look there, go d�, go d�. You are lucky, very lucky. I will again. -A�! -Charley. What are you doing? Mr. Foy, your turn. Let's go in, Dad. You never missed a cue. Go... If I catch them playing dice with my son again get you out of the loop. After breaking your skulls. Great school, huh? What's wrong with playing dice? It's the best way to learn to add. Ah yes. And when to Christmas? You will spend learning to play billiards. Christmas is right after Syracuse, isn't it? Every year Madeleine and I. The happiest time for children is at Christmas. In �rvore, his name is New Rochelle. Hanging socks on the foot of the bed. Children must spend Christmas at home. Dad, the curtain is opening. Chinatown, my chinatown Where the lights are dim Ah, what a peaceful village. Hearts that don't know another place Going to c� and c� Por ali, Bryne. On�rica, on�rica Chinatown almond brown eyes The hearts well in the light And life is bright Na or�nica Chinatown So here is Chinatown. The mysterious Chinese neighborhood. What will it be? What are the strange horrors that lurk behind the walls? Do you want to see China's mysteries? Want to see the horror cameras? Would you like to see many strange things? More than you? I paid to see. I got into the game for real. Come with me. Eddie, I've never asked you for anything before. It's fine, it's fine. A holiday, for the sake of the children. I said I'm fine. We have a free week anyway. Let's all go to New Rochelle, let's have Santa's party. And I'll tell the kids as soon as they're done. Thank you. Great, I'll wait for you when you're coming down the chimney.

Dad told us we were going to spend Christmas at home after one more lap around the circuit. We can already smell the plum pudding. Now I'm going to prove that I'm the best businessman in the business. What is the last place in the world where would someone put these seven incompetents? -Where? -Where is it? You're kidding! -No Palace Broadway. -Mais work. Eddie Foy and the Seven Little Foys. No Palace. I've waited 20 years and you get there in six months. Without you, we would have reached five. They will debut in the week of Christmas. -Natal! -Melou. -� the best week of the year. -At Christmas! Oh, come on. He didn't speak seriously. Christmas week, Barney? They wouldn't schedule that kind of clowning around Christmas week. -It was hard, but I managed. -Oh no. Well, won't anyone thank me? -Get the fuck out. Give it away. -What did I do? What a terrible thing! What crime did I commit? Skirt. I'll talk to you later. You won't do this, you promised. Christmas is family time, not work time. It's what this family does, it works together. And what's wrong with working together at Christmas? Mama mia, even on holidays and the kids have to dig bread and butter for you. For the two of us. You don't know what the Palace is? -What is it? -We can't refuse. If the kids work in the theater, I want them to be having a high year. That's what we worked for, to get up there. -This specimen is yours, isn't it? -Yes, what did he do? Calm down, this is my good ear. He was behind the chest in the dancers' dressing room looking over the lid. -And he still wears short pants. -Okay, thank you very much. Won't you take action? Of course, I'll give you long pants. If he were my son, I'd hit him in the face. And what were you doing in the dancers' dressing room? I'll talk to your father. That's how you say it, Dad. Hey! Why did it? I don't know, I thought I should do it. But I don't think it's any use. I couldn't hit it hard, so I wouldn't stop you from growing. You almost did it the other day. If your mother were here, she would know what to do. I'll take care of it, see? Christmas, dating, dressing room, ballerinas, It is the last place to raise children. Can't blame the theater, it could have happened in New Rochelle. Of course, there are ballerinas in New Rochelle. -The boy is being normal. -I beg you. Let me take the kids, you stay in the theater, It is your place, not theirs. I give them a home. The number goes to the Palace, you won't stop it. I had forgotten. You need the children to have their name on the poster. Eddie Foy and the Seven Little Foys. You should change your name, right? Eddie Foy and the Seven Little Orphans. Look, I'm doing what I can, I'm trying to be a father to these kids. I will cry for you. Now you're going to be a father, mother and aunt, because I'm leaving! You've been leaving for 15 years, I still haven't seen the back of your dress. -But now you'll see, I'm going! -Very well, I will not beg, I'll meet you there in New Rochelle. New Rochelle, no. I'm going to Italy. It's great for me, but life in Italy is hard. I'll buy a one-way ticket. I'm sorry, Aunt Clara. Bryan, you're the oldest. Now you are responsible. God have mercy. Oh, Aunt Clara... Mary, you're going to be the mama now, take good care of everyone. Yes, Aunt Clara. Try to study hard, and every night say your prayers. -Why should we ask? -For your father. Can't I order a bike? First your father, then the bicycle. Aunt Clara, please don't. I gotta go. Richard, bring the handkerchief that's in my bag. Will you cry? I'll just blow my nose. Then I'll find a way to get you away from him. On Christmas Eve, we left for New York, for the Palace, but Dad got off at the first stop. Look, I got seven kids sleeping on that train, � Christmas Eve. If I don't have seven socks, I lose my bread. -Don't you have a Christmas spirit? -What is this? Furthermore, they belong to the Chamber of Commerce of Bel�m. -I give ten dollars for them. -Fifteen. -Twelve. -Fourteen. -Thirteen and fifty. - Sold. To board! Oh, little tower of Bethlehem, with you it has changed in 2000 years. Merry Christmas to everyone! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. New York, New York City! Mary. -Woke up. -It's coming. All right, what are you up to? We vote for us. But it's Christmas, don't you want a Christmas present? We can buy with our money. - We're all working. -To support you. When you promised we'd go home. All right, don't expect me to beg. I've done everything I know how. We are no longer a family, we are only going to perform together at the Palace. Not Natal. Don't worry, it will be our farewell. I spare you. I've always been very good on my own. -What happened to him? -Shut up. PALACE - EDDIE FOY AND THE SEVEN LITTLE FOYS So we finally got there. We were on the Palace stage. And at least for the audience, we were a very happy family. Dad still wished this wasn't the farewell performance. Aunt Clara came to see our premiere, but there was something we didn't know. His two friends were employees Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Merry Christmas, Dad. George Washington was the father of his country Just like other parents we can name Has the father Nickerbock that took us off the nail He should be in the hall of fame What a beauty. Let's talk good about the Whistlers' father And father Hanson, the father of baseball But when I see my children lined up I see the world is mine 'Cause I'm the greatest father in the world For he is the greatest father of all As soon as he left the stage, Dad got the subpoena. Aunt Clara had found a way. New York City bylaws leave no doubt on this point. The person who employs, or has employed, or trains for exhibition purposes any child under the age of 16 in plays or balloons, or playing some musical instrument, - You are committing a misdemeanor. -The law must be changed! Sit down! Your Excellency, I am a man of few words, look at these children, they look undernourished, exploited, tired... Barney, Barney, please. Your Honor, I'd like to save everyone time. - I'll plead guilty. -Guilty! How guilty?! Do you want to lose your children? They will deliver the children to this lioness here. �. I think it will be better for them. I took a step bigger than my legs when I wanted to be a father. I only tried because I knew their mother wanted me to try. I owed her a lot. I know nothing but theater. I've spent my whole life on the palvus. I thought there was nothing wrong in wanting my children by my side. If I were a carpenter, would they be in the trade, and no one would bring me to court. Maybe your father was a judge. That's all I know. I am a singer and dancer. You don't think it's much, but you would have been happy if some of my kids wanted to stay in the business. That's where I made my big mistake. I wasn't creating actors, I was creating carpenters. They hated everything they did. I think the best thing for them would be for me to travel again and... send a check home every week. I just hope you'll let me pay them a visit once in a while. I'm used to them. I want you to know that this was the effort longest I've done without anyone laughing. What amazes me, Mr. foy. It is that you did not make this decision before. Second this request, It's been almost a year since these poor children have been forced to to a lifestyle in which he does not have a home and does not have a childhood. -How can he be so invincible... -Ah, dismiss him, judge. This is still a courtroom, young man. Against their will these poor children were dragged from town to town... -The stage is my second home. -�. - You should try it. -�, you old goat! If your children continue to disturb, I will have them expelled from here. Oh, that's great. You know how to treat children, don't you? Send us to jail. What college did you graduate from, huh? -Silence! -I will not shut up, that's the problem, we never told anyone, we like the theater. We're horrible, but we really like it. Of course we weren't going to tell Dad. Because he thought we were going to get close to him and say: Dad, we're having a great time and you're the greatest. -He snubbed us. -Of course yes. We want parents we are not just anyone. We want him to stay at the end of the year. What does he want us to do, wash his hands? And why is he always angry? We might like Aunt Clara too. The country is free. We are not exactly angels. I think we've done some pretty horrible things, but with the old one we don't do it twice. He knows how to take care of us. -He's done everything. - Of course I do, many times. We are very well educated, he took care of us. That's right, Judge, even little Irving here. He's not even old enough to go to school yet. No, not yet. Tell Mr. Judge, what is the capital of the United States? Baltimore. �, until he did well, he missed by only 57 km. People were never there. Are you selling? It is not easy to deal with us. And we are many too. I wouldn't want to be the father of this class. - Neither do I. -Considering the material he had, Dad did an excellent job. And you who feel in daddy's tap dance, I won't let it, I don't know what the others will do, but as for me Give me freedom or give me death! Are you ladies and gentlemen finished? I remembered, the capital of the United States is fun. Irving, only speak when I say so. Oh, Mr. Foy, if I interpreted this last interference correctly your children are paying you a debt of gratitude that many carpenters would like to receive. Your Excellency, I am a man of few words... You've said them all, sit down! I am absolutely certain that there is a healthy family relationship antagonistic but healthy. I would like to get along so well with my children. But the law gives me no choice. At least when it comes to performing on stage in New York City. These children are minors, and I'm sorry Mr. foy but your appointment with Palace must be cancelled. Just a minute, Mr. judge, I didn't go to law school, but as far as I know exceptions are one of the most important matters. What are you implying? Now, that thing you were reading about a person which employs younger children to... purpose of singing, dancing or playing a musical instrument commits contravention. �, Mary, Madeleine, come here. Give the referee a taste of your talent up front. See this Mr. judge. All right, you can sing. There are smiles, yes, there are smiles that make us happy There are smiles, yes, there are smiles that make us sad Enough, enough, enough. Do you think this is singing? Richard, Charley. Your turn. Do your row, row, row dance number. One two. Do you think this is dancing? Irving! Show your number to the judge. Let's go. Do any of these children play a musical instrument? Oh, we don't know. - Officer Harrison? -Yes sir. - Officer Driscoll? -Yes, Your Honor. Willing to swear that this is the caliber of the presentation that you witnessed on stage? Yes, Your Honor. A little better. It could only be called entertainment with a great effort of imagination. Case closed. Thank you, judge. Thanks. Sunday was a great day. Aunt Clara decided to stay in America. Good Morning. I was ordered to serve you. What happened? Where is everyone? - Sunday. They all went to church. -And why didn't you go? I go on Saturdays. Where are my pants? There is always a first time. Father, I'm Eddie Foy. Has my family arrived here yet? You know, the seven children? Mr. foy. You are Catholic, aren't you? - of course. -You are welcome... but this is an episcopal church. It is that I am a foreigner in this city. Where is the Catholic Church? We do not have to give this type of information, But I believe it's on that corner. Oh! Thank you. Please tell the sacristan to ring all church bells, -and call the Presidents. -Right now. No! Can I enter this number? If I go, everyone goes. END Translation and synchronization: virtualnet
