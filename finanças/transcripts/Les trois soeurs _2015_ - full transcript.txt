THE THREE SISTERS BASED ON THE ANTON TCHEKHOV PLAY A VALERIA BRUNI TEDESCHI FILM THOSE PROVINCES IN RUSSIA, THEY CALLED THEM "THE DEAF CITIES", AND, GRANTED, NO NAME SUITED THEM BETTER. THEIR QUIET WAS PROFOUND. THEY CLOSED THEIR EARS OFF FROM THE NOISES OF THE WORLD. IRENE NEMIROVSKY MAY 1896, A DEAF CITY 1,557KM AWAY FROM MOSCOW Father died only a year ago. A year ago... today. On your name day, Irina. The clock was ringing that day, too. What is the point in remembering? I always think to myself it's like I'm old already. Yes, each day. In the four years I've been working at the high school, I feel it leaving me, drop by drop almost. My strength and my youth. Only one dream keeps growing, looming imposingly. Going to Moscow. Selling the house, being done with everything here, and... -To Moscow. -Yes! Quick, quick, to Moscow. Our brother, surely, will be a university professor. He won't stay to live here, anyway. The only obstacle is poor Macha. Everything is good. Everything comes from God. But if I got married and could stay home all day, I think it would be better. I'd like my husband to be... Ivan Romanytch. Good old Ivan Romanytch! What is it, my little girl? What is it, my joy? Tell me. Why am I so happy today? It's like I'm being bolstered along by sails, a big all-blue sky, and large flying white birds. -But why...? -My white bird. Why? Today, when I woke up, I felt like everything in this world made sense to me, that I knew how to live. Oh, Doctor! I know everything! Men must work, whoever they are. They must earn their living by the sweat of their brow. Therein only dwells the meaning and purpose of life, their happiness, their enthusiasm. How beautiful it is to be a worker, rising with the sun and smashing stones along the roads, to be a teacher who instructs their children, or a train driver in his locomotive. My God, let's not even talk about man. Better to be an ox, a common horse, and work rather than be a young woman who wakes up at noon, takes her coffee in bed, and takes two hours to get dressed. If I don't start getting up and working, deny me your friendship, Ivan Romanytch. Sure, sure. Yearning for work. I understand that! I was born in Petersburg, a cold, idle city, into a family that had never known work or any kind of worry. It was saving me from work. I don't think they succeeded! Time came. It is a mountain moving towards us all, a powerful and clean storm brewing. It is close and will sweep through our society, idleness, prejudices against work, and the rancid rottenness of boredom. I will work. And in 25 or 30 years, at most, -every man will work. -I won't. Yes, but you don't count. In 25 years, you will no longer be in this world. In two or three years, you'll die from a fit of rage or I'll get angry and put a bullet in your forehead. But it's true, I've never done anything. Since getting my degree, I've never lifted a finger. I haven't read a single book. Only newspapers. For instance, I know, because I read it in the paper, there was a certain Dobrolioubov. But I know nothing of what he wrote. God knows what he wrote. Where are you going? -I'm going home. -Strange. On a holiday? He'd barely said "phew" when the bear sitting on him smothered him. No matter. I'll come back this evening. Farewell, my sweet. I wish you once again, take care. I don't know, back in the day, in Father's time, on our name day, there were always 30 or 40 officers. It was loud. Now, there's not a soul. It's quieter than the desert. Forgive me. I'm not feeling cheerful today, I'm going to walk a bit. Ivan Romanytch, what did you do! What is it? Is it a sewing machine? Doctor, you should be ashamed! That's monstruous! My dear little ones, you're all I have. Everything that is dearest to me in this world. Oh! I'm nearly 60. I'm an old man, an insignificant, solitary old man. I have nothing good in me, apart from the love I have for you. Without you, I would have been gone from this world long ago. It looks like a sewing machine? My dear little child, I held you in my arms. I've known you since you were born. And... And what? And nothing! Farewell. I'll be back tonight. My dears, my dear! A colonel, a stranger! He's coming! He's taking his coat off. Verchinine, certainly. Lieutenant-colonel Verchinine. My respects. Alexandre. Very, very happy to finally find you in your home. Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh my God, the lunch! It should've been served ages ago! Olia, come on. Come now! Come here! Lieutenant-colonel Verchinine is from Moscow. You're from Moscow? Yes, yes. I studied in Moscow. I started my career there. I was there a long time. I've just been put in charge of a battery in this city. I've been transferred, you see. I don't really remember you. I just remember you were three sisters. I still remember your father. Why, if I close my eyes I see him, as if he were here. I'd often go to your place in Moscow. I thought I remembered everyone. Alexandre Ignatievitch, you're from Moscow. What a surprise! What with us moving there, too. We're thinking we'll be there come the fall. It's our native town. It's where we were born. I remember now. Do you remember, Olia? In our house, we'd say, "The enamored major." You were a lieutenant. I don't know who you were in love with or why, but to make fun, we'd call you "the enamored major". Yes, yes, "the enamored major", that's right. But my, how you've aged. Oh, my! How you've aged! Yes, when they called me the enamored major, I was still young, I was in love. Now, that's over. But you have almost no white hairs. You've aged, but you aren't old. Yet 45 years have gone by. Did you leave Moscow long ago? Eleven years. What street did you live on? Old-Bassmannaïa. Us too! We also lived on Old-Bassmannaïa! For a while, I lived on German Street. But such countryside here! Wonderful countryside. Yes. But it's cold here. And we have mosquitoes. What are you saying! Finally, such a nice climate, so invigorating. What's odd is the station is 20 versts away and no one knows why. I know why. It's that if the station were nearby, it wouldn't be far, and if it's far, it's that it isn't near. Very funny, Vassili Vassilitch. That's nice. -I knew your mother. -You... -You knew her? -Yes, Sofia Egorovna. Mother is buried in Moscow. In Novodievitchi. Imagine, I'm already starting to forget her face. It's the same with us. They won't remember us either. We'll be forgotten. Yes, we'll be forgotten. It's our fate, nothing doing. What seems very serious and important to us, when the time comes, will be forgotten, have no gravity. And, mind you, we simply cannot know, know, what, ultimately, will seem elevated, serious, or pathetic and ridiculous. Copernicus's discoveries, say, or Columbus's, initially seemed useless, ridiculous, didn't it, when I don't know what nonsense written by some idiot seemed like the pure truth? It is wholly possible that our life, with which we get along well in, could seem, in time, strange, uncomfortable, unwitty, and impure, maybe even sinful. Who knows? Maybe they'll find our lives elevated. Maybe they'll remember them with respect. You can deprive the baron of bread. As long as he can philosophize. Vassili Vassilitch, please leave me alone. You're starting to annoy me! You just said, Baron, we'll find elevation our lives. And yet the people in it are small. Look how small I am. It's to comfort me you must say my life is elevated. We understand that. That's Andreï, our brother, playing. The family scholar. He'll be a professor, no doubt. Dad was in the military. His son had a science career. -In keeping with Dad's wishes. -He's a bit in love. Of a young lady here. She'll come today, it seems like. Oh, my! How she dresses! It's not that it's ugly or old-fashioned, just pathetic. A sort of little dress, loud, yellowish, with a coarse little fringe and a little cherry cami. And her cheeks washed, washed. Probably to make them look younger. Andreï's not in love. I could never believe such a thing. He's just doing it to make fun of us, to show-off. I heard she was marrying Protopopov, the local council president. Good for her. Andreï, excuse me. This is my brother, Andreï Sergueïtch. A pleasure, Alexandre. Prozorov. You're our battery commander? Alexandre Ignatievitch is from Moscow. Well, congratulations. My sisters won't leave you alone. Come here. Come here! Stop it! One minute! Leave me, please. Stop it, Andreï! Oh, he's funny! Alexandre Ignatievitch, they used to call him "the enamored major". He didn't mind at all. No, not at all! I was to call you "the enamored trombonist". Or "the enamored professor". He's in love! Andrioucha is in love! Oh, my! Andrioucha is in love! Bravo! Alright, enough, enough. I didn't sleep all night. I'm a bit under the weather. I read until 4 a.m., then I went to bed, but there was nothing for it. I was thinking about... And then suddenly, it was day. Sun filling the room. While I'm here, this summer, I plan to translate a book from English. -You can read English, can you? -Yes. With Father, life was an educational tyranny. It's silly, it's stupid. But I do have to admit, after he died, I started putting on weight. Look how much weigh I've put on in a year. It's like my body has freed itself of some yoke. Thanks to my father, my sisters and I know French, German, and English. And Irina knows Italian, too. But at what cost! Knowing three languages here is a useless luxury. Not even a luxury, it's a sort of useless appendix, like a sixth finger. We know a lot of superfluous things. A lot of superfluous things? Well, fancy that! In the next 300 years, life on earth will be incredibly beautiful, dazzling. Man needs that sort of life. And while he may not yet have it, he must sense it, be expecting it, dream, prepare for it. And consequently, he must know, see more than his fathers and grandfathers have seen and known. And you, you... Well... "A lot of superfluous things!" I'll stay for lunch. Mind you, the flowers you have here... All these flowers! I envy you. I don't like this Vassili of yours. I'm afraid of him. -What are you thinking about? -Nothing. Let's say that the life we have lived already is like a draft and... With the life we have... That the life we've lived is a draft, but that this time, we can start over, here, consciously. The one we've perhaps lived already doesn't exist, there is a new one. The one coming is the real one. I imagine that each of us would make an effort not to repeat ourselves. I have a wife, two little girls. And my wife, what's more, is in fragile health. If I could start my life over, I wouldn't get married. No, I wouldn't get married. We are still young. We have our whole life ahead of us. A long, long series of days, all filled with my love for you. Nikolaï Lvovitch, don't talk to me about love. I have a passionate thirst for living, fighting, working. That thirst has melded in my soul with my love for you, Irina. And, miraculously, you're beautiful. And life seems so beautiful to me. What are you thinking? You say, "life is beautiful". Yes, provided you are willing to find it beautiful. Lunch is served! For us three sisters, life hasn't been beautiful yet. It has suffocated us like a weed. What you have to do is work, work. We were born to people who disdained work. My dear sisters! Allow me to wish you a happy name day and to earnestly wish you, from the bottom of my heart, good health and everything you might want for a young woman of your age. Fiodor, I'm a teacher at the high school. And an extra counselor. I'm Macha's husband. Today is Sunday, my friends! So, let us rest and rejoice, each in accordance with their age and situations. The Romans were healthy because they knew how to work and how to rest, too. They had a mens sana in corpore sano. It's the same when it comes to daily life! Macha, at four today, we'll be at the headmaster's. They're having a stroll for teachers and their families. I won't go. Why not? Leave me, please. Following which, we'll spend the evening at the headmaster's. In spite of his failing health, this man is making an effort to be sociable. An extraordinary, remarkable character. I am extremely happy to have met you. -You're leaving? No, no! -No, no, no! Stay and have lunch with us, please. -We're asking you to. -I'm asking you to. Well! I'm sorry, but it seems like I've shown up at a party and, forgive me, I didn't know. I didn't wish you a happy name day. Friends, please, lunch is served! Oh, my dear Olga, my good friend! Hat. Hair. Natalia Ivanovna! My dear sister Irina Sergueïevna, all my best wishes! Hello, Baron. You have a lot of guests. I am terribly embarrassed. They're all my friends. You wore a green belt. Is that unlucky? No. It just doesn't suit you. It seems a bit strange. -Is everyone gone? -Yes, where are they? Are you all in there? Irina, I wish for you a very good fiancé. It is time for you to marry. Natalia Ivanovna! Natalia Ivanovna, we wish a little fiancé for you, too. Natalia Ivanovna already has her little fiancé. I'm having a little drink. Must make the best of things! I'd give you a D for behavior. But anyway, the liqueur is good. What kind is it? Cockroach! Thank God, today, I am staying at home all day. And tonight, too, at home. Friends, come back this evening. Me too, allow me to come back. Please. It's casual here. The pleasure of love Lasts only for a moment The sorrow of love Lasts a lifetime Congratulations. I wish everything, everything for you! You look gorgeous today. Here, I brought you a spinning-top. -How nice of you! -Stunning shape. Ten! When there are ten people in a room, there must be lovers. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! It's not you, is it, Ivan Romanytch? I'm just an old sinner. But Natalia blushed, there, earlier. I really can't think why. Pleasure of love Lasts only a moment Sorrow of love Lasts a lifetime Lasts for a lifetime Pleasure of love Only lasts for a moment Sorrow of love Lasts for a lifetime Pleasure of love Lasts only a moment Sorrow of love Lasts for a lifetime Sweetie! They're all nice. They have good hearts. Sweetheart! I am not used to society. I feel so good. My heart is full of love, full of... Be my wife! I love you. I love you more than anyone has ever had. FEBRUARY 1897 -Are you German? -No. You have a German name. I have a triple name. I am Baron Touzenbach-Krone-Altschauer, but I am Russian Orthodox, like you. Altschauer! There is nothing German left in me. Apart from, maybe, the persistence with which I am bothering you. -I'll walk you home every night, -I'm tired. and every night, I'll come get you at the telegraph. I'll do it for 20 years if you don't chase me away. Just now, there was a woman who wanted to send a telegram to her brother in Saratov. She wanted to tell him she'd just lost her son today and she just couldn't remember the address. I just sent the telegram like that, with no address, just "Saratov". And she cried. And I sent her packing. I told her, "I don't have time." It was so stupid. Well, if you didn't have time... She just lost her son. Yes, I get it. And I don't have the time. She just lost... If you didn't have the time, you just didn't. It was so stupid. What time is it? 7:15. Everyone's lost their heads with this carnival. To think Olga and Irina still haven't come home. They're always working. I'm scared. Bobik is freezing. Yesterday, he had a fever. Now, he's freezing. -I'm so scared. -It's nothing, Natacha. The little guy is fine. And today, between 8 and 9, apparently, the masks are coming. It would be better if they didn't, Andrioucha. But we invited them. Well... Then, let's tell them not to come. But it will be like with my sisters. They decide things here. But I'll tell them, too. If Bobik is ill... For dinner, I'll want fermented milk. The doctor says you need fermented milk or you won't lose weight. Oh, I'm scared. Bobik is freezing. He must be cold in his room. Irina's room will be perfect. Why aren't you saying anything? What do you want me to say? We started fighting at 7 a.m., and at 9, I left, slamming the door behind me. These are things I never talk about. It's strange. I only complain to you. I hope you aren't mad. Aside from you, and only you, I have no one, nobody. It's dark in here. But I see the light in your eyes. You are a wonderful woman, marvelous. A wonderful woman, marvelous. When you talk like that, I laugh, I don't know why, even if I'm scared. Don't say it again, please. Oh, go ahead and talk. What does it matter? It matters not to me. I like... I like... I like your eyes, your gestures, which I see in my dreams. Oh, little chickedy! You're here! The masks are going to come today. Rest. Tired. I don't like the telegraph. I don't like it. I should look for another job. This one doesn't suit me. What I wanted so much, dreamt of, is just what she lacks. A job with no poetry, no ideas. Yesterday, the doctor and Andreï went to the club and they lost again. Apparently, Andreï lost 200 rubles. Well, what can you do! Two weeks ago, he lost. In December, he lost. It would be better... It would be better to lose it all, then, maybe we'd leave this town. My Lord God, every night I dream of Moscow. A real nutcase! The only thing is that Natacha can't know he lost. Why aren't you saying anything, Alexandre Ignatievitch? I don't know. I would like some tea. My kingdom for a glass of tea! I haven't eaten since this morning. The president has sent you a booklet -and a document, here. -Thank you. What? Why did you come late? When I came to see you, it was still day. They wouldn't let me in. "The gentleman is busy," they said. Well, sure, but... Tomorrow is Friday. There is no session. What? But I'll go anyway. It'll keep me busy. I get bored at home. My little grandpa. How life changes! How strange and deceptive it is! I am the secretary for the Zemstvo Council. What? Secretary. I'm a secretary. And the most I can hope for is to become a member. Member... A member of the Council. A member! I, who see myself nightly, as a professor at Moscow University, a famous scholar, the pride of all Russia! I didn't know. I'm hard of hearing. If you weren't, I wouldn't speak to you. I need to talk to someone, but my wife doesn't understand me. My sisters, I don't know why, but they scare me. I think they make fun of me, ridicule me. Have you been to Moscow? No, I haven't been to Moscow. I can't. I don't like bars. But I'd be so happy to spend some time in Moscow! At Testov's or at the Grand Muscovite. In Moscow, earlier, an assistant back at the office was saying there were merchants eating crepes, and one of them, he ate 40! And he died, they say. The same assistant was saying, maybe he was lying, that apparently, all across Moscow, they'd laid out a cable. To do what? I don't know. It was the assistant who was saying it. Nonsense! Irina Sergueïevna! -Yes? -Come join me. I lost my glasses. Where are they? Well, my word, if there is no tea, let us philosophize. Oh! Very well. What about? -What about? -My white bird. Let us dream a little, for instance, about what life will be like after us, in 200 or 300 years. After us? They'll change the cut on jackets. They'll fly around in hot air balloons. Maybe they'll discover a sixth sense. But life will remain similar, full of mysteries and happy. And in 1,000 years, men will go on moaning, "Oh, how hard life is!" And at the same time, just as they are today, they will be scared of death and won't want to die. How do I put this? I feel like everything on Earth is destined to change, little by little, and that everything is already changing before our eyes. -What is it? -Nothing. I'm laughing. I don't know why. I've been laughing since this morning. There is no happiness. There mustn't be. There will not be for us. We must just work, work, and work some more. Happiness will be the lot of our distant great-nephews. And if they aren't mine, it will surely be my great-nephews' great-nephews. So, I can't even dream of happiness, then? What if I'm happy? No. Then we don't understand each other. No. How do I convince you, then? Forget about 200 or 300 years. Even in a million years, life will be the same. It's immutable. It follows its own laws, which don't concern you and you will never know. Migratory birds, for instance, fly. Regardless of the thoughts that cross their minds, they fly, with no clue why or where. They fly and they'll always fly. Regardless of the philosophers who emerge among them, they'll go on flying! But I mean, come on, the meaning? The meaning? Yes, well. It's snowing. Where is the meaning there? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 I love... I love... I love that man. At first, he seemed strange to me. Then, I felt sorry for him. Then, I loved him. I loved him. With his voice, words, sorrows, and two little girls. And he loves me, too. When you read a novel, it all seems old and everything so easy to understand, but when you love, then you see no one knows anything and that everyone must decide for themselves. You know, Maria Sergueïevna, I am resigning. I was told. And I don't approve of it one bit. I don't like civilians. I am not handsome. What value can I have as a soldier? I'll work. At least once in my life, I'll work so hard that when I get home at night, I'll collapse on my bed exhausted and I'll fall asleep like a log. How well workers must sleep! Happy is he who doesn't notice if it is summer or winter. "Balzac's wedding took place in Berditchev." If I was in Moscow, I don't think I'd care about the weather. "Syktyvkar, smallpox is striking." We don't have happiness. We never have it. We can only dream of it. Where did the little candies go? Vassili ate them. All? A letter for Mr. Verchinine. His daughter. For me? Please excuse me, Maria Sergueïevna. I have to go. I won't have any tea. Always this drama. What's going on? What is it? My wife has poisoned herself again. -I have to go. -His wife what? Terrible how unpleasant this all is. My dear, my wonderful, my sweet Maria Sergueïevna. When will the masks arrive? They promised they'd come around nine o'clock. So, now. Did he leave? And I was just serving tea. What a pain he is! Leave me be. You're pissing me off, old bat! Why are you getting angry, my little girl? You're not nice, Maria. If I'm not nice, don't talk to me. Don't touch me! Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me... Sixty years and you're there, like a kid, spouting nonsense. My cognac! Just leave me my cognac! A little girl crying by the water's edge. A little girl crying by the water's edge. Oh, I'm going to get some cognac. You're always alone, thinking. About what, no one knows. Come on. Let's make up. Make up? Why? We're not quarreling. You always suggest something has happened between us. You have a strange personality. -Strange? -You have to admit. Why, who isn't strange, then? When I'm alone with someone, it's fine, I'm like everybody else, but in company, I'm dark, I say silly things. And yet, I am more honest and respectable than some, aren't I? I often lose my temper with you. You're always looking for a fight when we're in company, and yet, I don't know why, you're likeable to me. Not you. I'm getting drunk today. It's the lover. That's good timing. God's house! It's Moscow! The hanged man! It's beyond all hope. So, no more Moscow! Tcheremcha isn't meat, my dear, it's a plant, sort of like our onion. Sieben. No, tchekhartma isn't onion, it's mutton. And tcheremcha? Tcheremcha? I'm talking about tchekhartma. -I'm telling you tcheremcha is onion. -Yes, but... Tcheremcha is onion. I'm telling you. Tcheremcha is onion. What's the point arguing with you? You've never set foot in the Caucasia. You've never eaten Tchekhartma! No, I've never eaten it quite simply because I can't stand it. Tcheremcha smells like garlic. Du bist eine grosse Frosch! Und du... Come on, now, Doctor. How old are you? I'm 32! It's broken. Broken. Sofia Egorovna. Sofia Egorovna. Oh, Andreï! Oh, my Andripoo! Let's dance, Andriouchki! You know, you and I will go to the university in Moscow. Andreï! We're going to go to the university, the two of us, to Moscow! Which one? There are two universities in Moscow. There is only one university in Moscow. Excuse me. There are two! Three, even, maybe! There are two universities in Moscow. -The old one and the new one. -There are 12! If you don't want to listen to me, if my words annoy you, I cannot talk to you, too! Bobik is sick. What's going on? I don't know. We have to go, apparently. But what about the masks? Yes, the masks. The masks aren't coming. You understand, Natacha says that Bobik is a bit unwell, so she doesn't want... Anyway, I don't know. It doesn't matter to me. Bobik is a bit unwell. It's not Bobik who's unwell, it's her. In there! -The little bourgeoise! -Bourgeoise! Come on. Let's go! Let's go outside. -Let's go outside. -Come on! Come on. Let's go outside. Come on. Come on. Let's go outside. Rodé, your shoes! Hey! Rodé, come on! Andreï, I didn't have time to get married because life went by in a flash. And I was crazy in love with your mom. Irina. Irina is my daughter. Getting married is pointless. It's pointless because it's boring. That's true. But solitude... You can do all the philosophizing you want, solitude is a terrible thing, my little man. -Although, after all, no matter! -Let's go, quick. -Why hurry? We have time. -I'm scared my wife will stop me. I won't play today. I'll just watch. Ivan Romanytch, what can I do against shortness of breath? Who is it? The masks. What? The masks. Tell them no one is here for them to forgive us. There is no one here? Where is everyone? They went home? You're alone here? Yes. You're not like the others. You're noble -and pure. -Farewell. You want the truth? I love... I love... I love... Leave! Leave! I can't do without you. I can't live without you. Those gorgeous, astounding eyes. It's my first time talking about my love for you. It's like I'm not on Earth but on another planet. I don't love you. You can't force someone else to love you, of course. But I want no happy rivals. I don't want that. I swear to you on all that is most sacred, -I'll kill my rival... -Is Andreï here? Excuse me, Vassili Vassilitch, I didn't know you were here. I'm not dressed. You should go to bed earlier. Speaking of, I wanted to tell you, about Bobik, the children's room, the current room, I find it cold and humid. Your room is ideal for a child. You could share Olia's room in the meantime. Whose? Olia's. Yours will be for Bobik. My goodness! They said they were having a party. Everyone is gone. What about the masks? My head hurts. Did Macha leave, too? And Andreï lost 200 rubles at cards yesterday. It's the talk of the town. Yes, that Council tired me out, too. Where is Macha? I'm exhausted. She must've gone home. I suppose. Oletchka, my darling, I often think to myself, had there been no Macha, I would have married you, Oletchka. You're very nice. You don't marry out of love but to fulfill your duty. That's what I think, at least. And I would even get married without love. The first person who asked me, I'd marry them. No matter. I would even marry an old guy. If you want some advice, marry the baron. After all, you respect him. Sure, he isn't handsome, but he is honest. My head hurts. I'm going to bed. In Moscow... SEPTEMBER 1901 Farewell, house! Farewell, trees! Farewell, echo! I can just see you getting married over there, in Poland. Your little Polish wife taking you in her arms and saying kochane! I've got to go, otherwise, I'll start crying. We had happy times, here. Write to us and don't forget. -Farewell. -Farewell! -Farewell! Farewell! -Farewell! Gone. He forgot to say goodbye to me. What about you? Me? I don't know. I forgot, too. Anyway, I'll be seeing him soon. The brigade leaves today and I tomorrow. I've still got one day. In a year, I'll be retired. I'll come back here. I'll end my days by your side. Just one more little year until retirement. I'll come back to your house. I'll radically change lives. I'll be peaceful, you know? Proper, polite, and everything. True, you should change lives, my good friend. You'll have to, one way or another. Ta-ma-ra-boom-di-ey Ta-ma-ra-boom-di-ey Incorrigible! I should come do my schooling through you, then I'd mend my ways. Fiodor shaved his mustache. And I can't see that. Our headmaster shaved his mustache. And I did the same when I became an inspector. I shaved it. Nobody likes it, but I don't mind. With or without a mustache, I'm just as happy. Ta-ma-ra-boom-di-ey Ta-ma-ra-boom-di-ey Ivan Romanytch? My good Ivan Romanytch? I'm terribly worried. Yesterday, you were on the boulevard. Tell me, what happened there? Oh, what happened? Nothing. A trifle. They say that Vassili and the baron crossed paths -on the boulevard, by... -No, stop! I mean, it's true... Vassili tried to quarrel with the baron and he lost patience. He said something cutting. Some foolishness. Ta-ma-ra-boom-di-ey They say Vassili is in love with you, Irina. One can understand. You're a very nice young lady. You even look like Macha. Just as pensive. Only you, Irina, have a gentler temperament. Even though Macha also has a very good temperament, of course. I love Macha. I don't know. Everything scares me today. I've already prepared everything. I'm having my bags sent off this afternoon. Tomorrow, I'm marrying the baron. Tomorrow already, we'll go to the brickyard, and after tomorrow, that's it, I'll be at my school, and a new life will begin. When I passed my teacher's exam, I cried for joy. The car is ready. Oh, my pretty, my sweet, my golden one. You've come a long way. No one will catch up with you now. I've hung back like an old migratory bird who can no longer fly. Fly, my beloved ones. Fly! May God bless you. Yes, you were wrong, Fiodor Ilitch, to shave your mustache. There you have it. Today, the soldiers will leave and everything will go back to being as before. In spite of what might get said here and there, Macha is a good woman. I love her very much. I bless my fate. Fate! Fate. To each their own. I am not being granted a life in Moscow. Well, then. Amen! That's fate! You can't go against it. We are all in God's hands, it's true. Nikolaï Elvovitch asked me to marry him. I thought about it. I made my decision. He is a good man, stunningly good, even. And then, suddenly, it's as if my soul had wings. I've become gayer. I've felt light and once again, I've felt a will to work. Only yesterday, something happened. A sort of mystery is hanging over my head. Ta-ma-ra-boom-di-ey Ta-ma-ra-boom-di-ey I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, you poor thing. Bobik! Come over here! Come say hello to Auntie Olia. "Hello, Auntie Olia!" I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Anfissa. Up! Up. I said, up! Come on! Off you go! If I catch you just sitting around in front of me again! Why you keep that old bat around, I don't know. Excuse me? I don't understand, either. She's useless. She's a peasant. Those people belong in the village. What is this waste! I like the house being in order. No useless mouths. Poor thing, you're tired. Is our headmistress tired? When my Bobik has grown up and at the high school, I'll be scared of you. I won't be headmistress. You'll be elected, Oletchka. I can't. You were so rude with the nanny. I often say useless things, true, but admit she'd do just as well in her village. -She's been with us for 30 years. -She's unable to work, now. Either I don't understand you or you just refuse to see. She just sits and sleeps. Then, let her sit! What? Let her sit? From tomorrow, I don't want to see her here, that thief, that filth, that witch! And I forbid people from getting on my nerves! I forbid it! They think I'm a doctor, that I can cure the sick, but I've forgotten everything I knew. I remember nothing. On Wednesday, I was curing a suburban woman. She died and it's my fault she died. Twenty-five years ago, I knew some things, but now, I don't remember a thing. Nothing! It's empty in my head and cold in my heart. Maybe I'm not the same man. I'm just pretending to have arms, legs, and a head. Maybe I don't exist at all. It's just an impression that I'm walking, eating, sleeping. Oh, if I could not exist! And he just sits there, twiddling his thumbs! -So what? -Nothing. Did you love my mother? Very much. Did she? I don't remember. Things are boiling up inside of me! Here, look at Andreï! All hope has vanished. Those thousands of people raising the church bell, so much money, so much work put in, and suddenly, it just fell and broke for no reason. Andreï, it's the same. The first, second, and fifth battery leave at one exactly. And I do tomorrow. Forever? I don't know. I might be back in a year. The town will empty out. As if extinguished by a candle snuffer. Something happened, yesterday, by the theater. It's the talk of the town. I know nothing. It's nothing. Silliness. Vassili taunted the baron. The baron got mad and insulted him so much and so well that Vassili found himself forced to provoke him to a duel. It seems it's already time, 12:30, in the community woods, the ones you see over there. Vassili thinks he's Lermontov. He's even writing couplets. That's all very nice, but this is already his second duel. Whose? -Vassili's. -And the baron? What about the baron? Everything is mixed up in my head. They can't get away with this. He could hurt the baron or kill him. The baron is a fine man, but what does one more or one less baron matter? It doesn't matter! To my mind, participating or witness a duel, even as a doctor, is just immoral. That's just an impression. Nothing is in this world. We aren't here. We don't exist. It's just an impression... It's like this all day long. He talks and talks. I won't go in the house. I can't set foot there anymore. Will you let me know when Alexandre is here? The migratory birds are leaving already. Our house is going to empty out. The officers will leave. Alexandre will leave. You'll leave, too. My sister will get married. Olga will become headmistress. She'll go live in town. I'll be alone in the house. What about your wife? My wife is my wife. She is honest. She is decent. I mean, good. But there is something in her that abases her to the level of a mere animal, blind, sort of rough. She's not a human being, anyway. I'm saying this as I would to a friend, the only one to whom I can open my heart. I love Natacha, I do, but sometimes, she strikes me as astonishingly crass. In those moments, I lose my footing. I cease to understand why I love her so much. Or why I loved her, anyway. Old pal, I leave tomorrow. We won't see each other again. So here is my advice. Doctor! Listen, put on your hat, grab your walking stick, and go. Go off and walk! Walk as much as you can. The further you go, the better it'll be. Doctor, it's time! It's 12:30. Please! Androuchka, if they ask after me, tell them I'll be right back. I'm coming! The old man worries in vain. I won't hurt him much. Just shoot him like a goose. What do my hands smell like? Like corpse, don't they? Do you remember the poem? Rebellious, it seeks out a storm As if in storms it could find peace! These are the papers you must sign. Sir, you have to sign these papers. These... Sir, the... But... But... Papers are made to be signed. But Andreï Sergueïtch, these papers aren't mine, they belong to the municipality. It's not... It's not me who came up with the papers. Where are you going? I have to go to town, to... -Say farewell to my friends. -You're kidding. Why are you so absent-minded today? What happened, yesterday, by the theater? I'll be back in an hour and I'll be with you once again. My beloved. Five years already that I've been in love with you. And I still can't get used to it. What gorgeous hair! What eyes! I'll take you away tomorrow. We'll be rich. My dreams will come back to life. You will be happy. We'll work. There is just one thing. Just one thing. You don't love me! It's not in my power. I'll be your loyal, submissive wife, but the love isn't there. What to do? I've never loved anyone in my life. Oh, how I dreamed of love. I've been dreaming about it for so long, day and night. But my soul is like a precious piano under lock and key. And the key is lost. In my life, nothing scares me, but that key tears my heart up and keeps me from sleep. Go on. Say something to me. No. -You say something to me. -What? Say something. But what? Say what? What can I say? -Something. -Enough! Oh! Such trifles, such stupid details sometimes take on importance in life, suddenly, just like that. They're trifles and yet you go and you know it'll never stop. I feel joyful. To think it's the first time in my life that I'm seeing these bitches, these birches, these trees. And all this is waiting for me. What lovely trees! It must be good to live near them, really. I have to go. It's time already. The papers you gave me are in my office under the calendar. -I'm going with you. -No. I'm going with you. No! You're not coming! -Irina. -What? I didn't take my coffee, today. Will you have some made for me? Where is it? Where has my past gone off to? The time when I was young, joyful, intelligent, when my dreams and thoughts were graceful, when the present and future were lit-up with hope? Our town has existed for 200 years. It has 100,000 residents. And no one here stands out in any way from the others. Not one learned scientist or artist, not one man who is remarkable in the slightest and who might give rise to jealousy or a passionate desire to imitate him. What do they do? They eat, they drink, they sleep, and they die. What do you want? These papers you need to sign. I've had enough of you. Who's talking so loud, here? Is that you, Andrioucha? You're going to wake Bobik. -I wasn't talking loudly. -No. Sign? My debts forced me to. I had to mortgage the house. What? I had to mortgage the house. It's because of my debts. They're worth 35,000. All I can say is that my sisters had pensions. I had no salary. I wish you everything, everything. Where is Maria Sergueïevna? Where is she? Somewhere in the garden. -I'll try to find her. -Please. I'm in a hurry. Maria! Maria! The town gave us something like a farewell banquet. We drank champagne, the mayor made a speech, I was eating, listening, and all my soul was here at your place. I'd gotten used to you. -Will we see each other again? -I don't think so. Maria! Tomorrow, in town, there won't be one soldier left. Maria! Nothing happens the way we want. I didn't want to be headmistress. I'm going to be one anyway. I won't go to Moscow. Alright. Thanks for everything. Forgive me if I did something off. I really spoke a lot, a lot. Forgive me for that, too. Don't keep a bad memory of me. And Macha still isn't here. Maria! What else can I say to say farewell? What subject can I philosophize on? Life is heavy. It seems walled-in, hopeless to many of us, and yet, you must admit, it brightens and lightens as it goes. The time is coming when it will be totally clear. I have to go. I really have to go! Humanity used to be wrapped up in wars. Its whole existence was about military campaigns, invasions, victories. Now, all that has been lived, leaving behind a huge emptiness that, for now, we don't know how to fill, but humanity is looking fervently. Olga will figure it out, I'm sure of it, but she must hurry! You see, if you combined teaching, love of work, and teaching... There she is. I came to bid you farewell. Farewell. Come, now. Write to me. Don't forget me! Leave me. Leave me. It's time. I have to go. Olga Sergueïevna, take her. I have to go already, I'm late. Macha. It doesn't matter. She can cry. Let her cry. My sweet Macha, my good Macha. You're my wife and I'm happy, regardless of what happened. I'm not complaining. I don't hold it against you. See, Olia here is a witness. We'll start living like before again. And not one word from me, not one allusion. "A green oak by the water, "the oak has a gold chain." I'm going crazy. Come now, Macha. "A green oak by the water..." Calm down. Give her some water. I'm not crying anymore. She's not crying anymore. She's being good. "A green oak by the water... "A big green cat... A green oak..." I'm getting muddled up. A failed life! I don't need anything, now. I'll calm down right away. What does "a green oak" mean? An oak. An oak! Why is that word in my head? My thoughts are getting mixed up. Calm down. Let's stay together a bit, at least. The thing is, I'm leaving tomorrow. I have an idea! I have an idea! Yesterday, in fourth period, I confiscated this mustache and beard from a kid. I look like the German teacher. It's true, you do look like the German. -The resemblance is striking. -Yes. Eins, zwei, drei... Come now, Macha. Irina. You're leaving tomorrow. How unfortunate! Go on. Move. Don't you want to stay another little week? Oh, no! My goodness, you scared me! I was thinking I could maybe put Andreï and his trombone in your room. Let him trombone all he wants! And Bobik in his room. He's so cute. Just this morning... A beautiful child, it's true. Why, what's that fork doing here? Who left this fork here? Anfissa! Anfissa! Who left this fork on the ground? Here we go again! Anfissa! I'm at wit's end. And so? And so, what does it matter? Today is a horrible day. What happened? What? What? Quick, say it! The baron died. I knew it! I knew it! Let her cry a little. Yes. I knew it. -I knew it. -What does it matter? No matter. You have to live. You have to live. We'll stay alone. We can start our life over. You have to live. You have to live. If you could know... Oh! If you could know... Tomorrow, I'll head off alone. I'll start teaching at the school. I'll work. A time will come when everyone will understand the point of all this, what all this suffering is for. There will be no more mystery. Now, it is fall. Soon, winter will come, the snow will cover everything, and I will work. I will work. They'll forget our faces, our voices, and how many of us there were. But our suffering will turn to joy for all those who come after us. Happiness and peace will come down to Earth. And remembering those who live on it now, they will spare a good word for us and bless us. FOR PATRICE CHÉREAU FOR PATRICE CHÉREAU
