Arjun accepted them from there. His goal was achieved. Why are you guys sitting there? Like it's raining, you go inside. Get . These are legally made for children adoption documents This is against my profession But these things are for educating those kids If a road is built, it's all worth it After marriage, we must legally accept these children as children ...

Tina, what do you blame yourself for? You fake documents in the name of non-governmental organizations? داد نزن! The reason is that you are a man who knows nothing! He raised three orphans. and help those he plays. It is immoral to support people like him Why does he allow these three children to stay? Why aren't they legally placed in an orphanage? Let go, he keeps these kids taking the house out of town ... I do not even know his background, Syed, Arjun is an orphan. he's a man who just grew up and learn well These are the children of someone Arjun has known for a long time. None of those children were there after his death So is it a crime for Arjun to bring such children back to life? He is a clean gentleman, Syed. Trying to convince Tina was futile. Trying to convince Tina was futile. I wish Arjun could think of a sensitive girl like Tina you can imagine How dangerous Arjun is. سلام Arjun, this, Syed, is my best friend Wait a minute. Hello ...

None of us saw him after that incident »Tina left her job at an NGO and then he, from the hospital in many places found out that he was being treated and then Tina's father died of a heart attack After that I found out about Tina only her relatives Although I tried to contact him several times but my efforts were in vain. Where are the hospitals where Tina was treated? Shanti Marian Hospital, about 40 km from here - One, Mrs. Doctor. Samuel Yes, Doc Samuel, he was the one who cured Tina Thank you very much. Sidart Try to finish it as soon as possible روی... Innocent Tina his only mistake was blindly in love with a psychic like Arjun Roy, please do not leave Tina! هوم رفیق Provide a lifelong experience Tina taught me to have a second باشم The next time we meet, yours is yours My close friend also made it I told you everything I know about Tina Now, from what the doctor says I need to understand Tina's condition Did Tina have a mental disorder? Did he leave after his full recovery? هوم روی If he was fine ... Are you not coming here to see me now? . you came? Tina was hospitalized in critical condition. He had a deep wound on his head But, I think, the effect is that his mind was heavy Wait a minute Nurse Tina ... Bring me the Tina Matthews file. آره ... As Tina recovers from her physical injuries she never recovered emotionally This is Tina's, Dad always walks When given the chance After staring at her father for a while Tina looked at him with suspicion and fear as if she were looking at a strange person I saw a big difference in his behavior I wanted to see him do it If he is suffering, it is to remove that brain he could not even recognize his father. I learned something very serious from the results after scanning and testing Thank you اینجا دیدن Look at this He believed that the patient's name was nine-year-old who replaced his daughter with the same swindler. he could not even recognize his daughter an unchangeable belief in him, continued from his daughter who looked the same Sometimes he says I'm not at home Running away from home too But another house like him دیوانه This type of situation is difficult for ordinary people to understand But medically it is called Capgrass Syndrome or it is called imposter syndrome For someone with this syndrome something happens that they do not believe is a close family member or instead of someone they love and trust takes a similar shape. Now let me explain to you what Tina's condition is When Tina sees Roy he believes that a stranger who looks like you will replace you Maybe this common sense within Tina I'm trying to accept this misunderstanding Therefore. What is he doing? He is trying to test you. You like to walk and talk He even takes food to his examination You do not like to drink tea, Roy. Now why do you like them? Husband did not like it he starts thinking about it The comfort and security of her own home made it difficult to understand all this Tina becomes a strange character Hiding from all this, he tries to escape, means now Tina Will you never know me? Not really By your words this trick Tina =, seems to do it one by one After a good night's sleep, his brain calms down. When he was delusional he has no memory of what happened Don't joke with me I mean Tina has this syndrome she does not even know. නෑ Tina knows of her bodily injuries here only that it was included. Unlike other illnesses, the patient with this mental condition usually does not say anything With the awareness of such people patients may experience stress and their reactions We as physicians do not accept such risks Consider and work first we do ... Unless there is a compelling reason behind it When is there such a syndrome How is Tina these days? If he is normal. How did this suddenly come back to haunt him? Tina, as long as you are here, you have to get rid of psychotherapy There are many ways we entered his subconscious tried to replace painful memories with positive ones ولی... Before we finish his treatment ... His relatives are awake He was released from the hospital and taken away ... You should not be surprised that Tina was a normal person he had no idea about this syndrome his focus was really on healing from his positive thoughts I know about Tina's condition. He can be treated with medicine as well as treatment I remember, you researched seizures he told me. Tina's condition is very similar to the phenomenon that occurs during an eclipse (solar eclipse / lunar eclipse). is something or someone ... Who has reappeared in Tina's life? What you do not know But I have no idea what it is If lost ... The shadow of your life disappears Definitely ... On, you take back the tin Here. Roy, this is his case. This is for his treatment in Singapore Leave it to the doctor Okay, thank you This is called Capgrass syndrome. he believes you are alike a stranger replaces you. Tina is innocent, she was wrong someone who was sincerely in love with a madman like Arjun Roy, please do not leave Tina! Something you do not know has come to life in Tina's life I can not understand what you are saying while holding my hand you feel safe. The memories I have of my father are not very complete The girl next door looks at me strangely. I feel very upset Hello aunt, I'm on I stay at a neighbor's house I think I saw you, please come inside A girl is here, right? Yes, my grandchildren Mahira My wife Tina She has no job and is often alone at home How many times have you said I have seen your granddaughter So if Tina could introduce Mahira, I thought they were two well made people These people? Are these Mahira's parents? آره... Are they there now? They are no more. A few years ago in a car accident ... What about Mahira? even though he was there thanks to God he was able to survive This was a big shock for him. After being there recently I saw that he is constantly searching your house Aunt, can I meet Mahira? Why not, of course? Girl ... fish. Come here girl Aju grew up with me in Bangalore because his mother told him to stay away That's why he's a little disobedient to me Cousin Aju - he has always been a unique character I have seen him for years I guess Uncle and he have a problem روی آرجون... آرجون منون! Someone who considers himself the father of the image While there is a real father, there is a slight difference This time you are even smaller than that small difference. متعجب My father always told me ... He wished that Uncle Menon had a son like him ... That love and compassion from your son and you he wished to receive But, I'm telling you There is no love or respect for your life You do not want to receive I saw you from where my father was Why did you betray me? Ignore me but Tina? What did he do to you? Your son was seriously injured at that time Did you have a reason? Tell me the truth What do you mean? Where is your son now? he can run, I can hide, but I'll find him I have no mercy on either of you. If Tina were alive today I would be a reason for that When I found out that someone was in critical condition because of Arjun. خیلی نگران و غمگین بودم تینا رو پیدا کردم به بیمارستان رفت و در آنجا بستری شد. تینا در شرایط بسیار بدی قرار داشت اگر قرار باشد کاری برای او انجام دهم او باید اعتماد خانواده اش را جلب می کرد پس به پدر آرجون زنگ زدم برای کسی فاش نشد. گفتم او را در حال انجام وظیفه می شناسم که او از روزهای کاری بود Tina, I knew everything that happened from the day I saw Arjun when I was in the hospital When he realizes that Arjun is the main cause of Tina's misery It was my responsibility to bring him back to normal life I felt As a doctor I can have him All support was done. I supervised Duck Samuel's treatment After he recovered, I knew his future was good with you So I proposed marriage The night you talked to me, I saw something incredible Tina was unconscious he was completely confused When I watch his behavior. I realized this was a recurrence of the syndrome. he was in trouble At that time I did not dare to tell you this. I gave him medicine to calm him down for a while After Tina's condition improved I thought about all this with you Let me talk But it was too late I always treated Tina like my daughter روی I have known you since childhood. can give him protection and happiness I realized it was just you I went to see him from time to time, even to avoid disturbing him even to remember his past, < i> to make sure he is happy. Even after all this worry, I do not know how Tina got back into this situation And then Arjun, he will never disturb your life. او رفت ... due to drug overdose he died of a sudden heart attack Lost himself. I know I can never make up for my mistake. Maybe to atone for his son's sins he must have been selfish of the father Please forgive me my son is something you did not know reappeared in Tina's life. But I do not know what it is. ... happy birthday ... Mr. Roy, I do not see a problem with Tina. he's fine, right?

Sidart Nir ویژگی 1 After we first met, I told you about the message you saw on Tina's cell phone. Listen to an unexpected question ; this is what you said in a hurry right as well as another ambiguity In fact, you can not send him such a message at any time ویژگی 2 ... According to Doc Samuel's medical records, Tina I was hospitalized on June 17 due to a car accident But according to your story, Tina was attacked on June 16, her birthday. Very good. The day with you Suppose it is tangled. But being Tina's best friend ... Who clearly knows behind all this that Arjun is there .. . You did not even bother to file a case with the police Instead of he was hospitalized and the cause of the accident was announced We had a lot of unanswered questions like this From a small book in my closet No one expected a big secret To be revealed. نگران؟ Let me start again The day Tina was admitted to the hospital, I realized the situation was getting worse. How did Tina, who used to be normal, get into this situation? The reason behind all this is incomprehensible I was crazy when I remembered Tina's phone D I checked all the details of his phone. Calls, messages, emails. I did not receive any relevant information other than an email. An email from everyone congratulating Tina alive help her by the way I wanted and my research started from there [I came to India the next day - but. You were not the first person I saw This is Sorendran's house, isn't it? سورندران؟ آره I told her about Tina's condition I asked him to tell me everything he knows about this You know that. Sir ... Please tell me Beyond a helping hand As the name implies, it is more than visible. Behind the shadows, there was an NGO engaged in evil activities For seasonal audits for NGOs Posted by National Inspectorate Data from many NGO reports varied Number of children in reports and NGOs There was a difference between the real numbers What do you want to do? "This has happened several times. Mr. Sidart Although 27 children are mentioned in this report. There are only 24 children here. Do you enter previous data? ولی سلام؟ Hello ... Here I am sir Let me show you the report again ... What do you show? The numbers in the records do not match the actual prices Tell your superiors to call me Look, my phone hung up That's it for me Received a call from an international number Do not unnecessarily interfere in the affairs of non-governmental organizations I was warned 1 من When I contacted them I realized that my doubts were true. I tried my way I was amazed at what I found. Between 2017 and 2018, about 15 children were sold by NGOs. Accepted for international countries at NGO Kids were like soup to the big brain Most of these kids have bought from ignorant parents and parents from poor families. Asking someone else questions with the consent of the parents In the international market ... These kids are either sold to brothels or some couple buy them for a lot of money. Summary Behind this kind organization It was a child trafficking movement that was active I had all the necessary documents to save those children ... I ask my supervisors to close the police officer tried to say ولی... I come straight خوب اب ... While driving under the influence of alcohol Auditor Surendran Pillay has a fatal car accident! This was the headline for the next day I lost my job. I My savings for treatment are gone They physically destroyed me. Both spiritually and financially Tina came to this place instead of me / I had only two options - either to forget the past bring the truth to the fore with the help of the right person. Tina had a good track record professionally My last hope was Tina he said he's real and can help me I realized I sent a copy of this testimony to Tina That's when I found out Tina had an accident. The only fate I had to face I felt very guilty I felt I had to take responsibility for Tina's illness. Although I tried several times to contact him I could not contact him After I lost hope that he was alive, I found out about you in the newspaper I emailed Tina like this. they start a business with innocent children I'm physically helpless I still have a strong mind I can not live like a coward who forgets everything Sir, you will never be alone in this fight The pain you suffer as well as the sacrifice will not be in vain, this is my promise went to Tina's house to search for Surrendran sheets he has everything in his room, you can go see my son After meeting you and Sorendo I had a good idea of ​​all these situations Although I was hoping to find information I instead got evidence that changed the game. An audit report that highlights discrepancies in the financial statements of NGOs ... Cut the newspaper of the missing children ... Admission of children in the same age group close to the date of the child's disappearance Tina and you said the photo of those three children ... and .. A photo of your best friend claiming to be your enemy ... Arjun, that's when I realized I knew Arjun Menun I knew there was a big scam going on behind the NGO There is all the evidence against you. But that did not solve my problem After all these months, I still do not know why Tina behaved like this Did Tina, who was somewhat sensitive to children, get hurt because of Mahira? But after meeting Mahira ... I knew Tina was not the reason for her behavior . We had a lot of big questions ahead. Tina's uncle or relatives about Tina's past Why didn't you tell me? Most importantly Tina Why don't you tell me? I can reveal it to my Tina Just remember it, right? The beta blocker in Tina's blood is a great drug To some extent may have helped to erase unpleasant memories. When the dose of this drug is increased a patient can be violent and even commit suicide Tina still suffers from the syndrome. After giving this medicine he started taking me He saw Arjun instead of me Unbeknownst to Tina ... Hypnosis through drugs his memory fades was destroyed inch by inch I knew you could not do all this work alone is so close to Tina that she can do it Only for a skilled doctor I sincerely hoped for someone, but you may not be behind it Sir, one mistake ... looks wrong! A girl and her suspicions When our business is disrupted ... I mean all this just to distract I trusted you. I counted on you! If this child dies, the media the police and everyone are behind this incident ... We must disclose! What are you doing now, Dad? I have a plan Do as I say You must die! What a brilliant map! Tina was miles away from exposing them all but you are his Arjun was used to divert attention from NGOs Create fake adoption documents for those children from NGOs He was caught One day, if he finds out the truth behind the NGO you can use that document against him and extort money from him. He's all to blame You can download and save your group with a clean letter By the way I decided to do it my own way. Talk about Arjun's involvement in Tina's story I started meeting you .. . After Surendran sent me a photo of the NGO's think tank. But, it is not so easy to capture the mind of a criminal like you . So just like what you did to me I decided to perform a play in front of you I talked to Sidart ... I told him about some of the illegal activities behind this NGO that this information I have received. All those announcements, as expected called his boss and told him. and I connected everything from one place to another If you kill Tina and there is a lawsuit behind it she will reveal about you and your business So, you've planned something big Anyway I wanted to ask you You were amazed at your skills After Tina and I went to Sydney. understood you and was under legal supervision You traded again through an NGO End of story! Mr. Vishwanat Menon, you planned a good crime! You tried through psychological methods to erase Tina's memories from Arjun ... Tina's father's death You saw it as an opportunity to stop treating her family you are his disease he hid it from everyone and married her to me Tina called Iron Pill You bought a house near our house because you need medicine and supervision Slowly pushed him to the brink of suicide But one book crashed all your apps However, Tina wants a book about eclipses Another book caught her attention He linked the stories in that book to his past. Gradually He had to go back to past memories Former Tina in ecstasy He misunderstood me as Arjun and tried to kill me If Tina did not behave like this ... Maybe I never knew about any of this I could lose him forever grab Dirty game you played with behind the shadow belief As we got closer, this knot became a growing death trap ... This is the trap you set for Tina But you are a complete failure What? The opponent you chose this time ... Tina on Cyrus!
