Bye, honey. - And don't forget your homework. Gimme your fucking money, man, before I smoke your bitch ass! Hurry up! Oh my God! Just do it! Listen to your lady. I said now, motherfucker! Hold it! Hold it! We'll do whatever you want! You want money? - What the fuck you think I want? Give it up! Aaaaaahhhhh! Try screaming now, bitch! (alarm clock) (fast rock music) (doorbell rings) (dog barking) Hey, Willie. -Morning, Camden. Morning paper. Thank you. -Que pasa? -Not much. I got to change the batteries in the smoke detector. Oh sure, yeah, come on in. Bring your ladder. Oh, here, let me help you. Thanks. I know I just changed these things a few months ago and they're probably good, but the law says I gotta replace them. Not that I'm complaining, cause if this place burns down, I'm out of a job and I don't need that. Yeah, neither do I. Listen, I'm just about to cook up some breakfast. Wanna join me? Hmm... (laughing) Uh, I can't. I've got a million batteries to change. Not everyone's as happy to see me as you are. Some other time then. I'll tell you what. I'll sneak out on the wife later on this week you and I could play some cards. Eh? Eh? Alright, alright, you're on. (rock music) Breakfast in the afternoon. Let the sunshine in the middle of my room. Just another hour (doorbell rings) Yeah? Delivery. Where's Quan? He took the day off. You gonna let me in or not. Here, let me take these. You wait right there, I'll be back. Have it your way. Nice place you got here. You live alone? Here you go. Thanks. Tell Quan to call me when he's back. Yeah, sure thing. Wanna date? Stuck up little yuppie. If you don't want to, just say no. You don't have to make that face. (doorbell rings) Donald, hi. Here's your mail. You must be on every mailing list in this country. Is there anything that you don't read? Yeah, street signs. Heh heh heh. Very good, Camden. I'm glad to see that agoraphobia hasn't deprived you of your wit. Speaking of which, agoraphobia, that is... I spoke to a doctor that specializes in your condition. You mean a shrink. He's willing to make a house call. Forget it. You haven't set foot outside this apartment in ten years. Why should I? I have everything I need here. Friends? A girlfriend? There's more to life than cable television. Aren't you my friend? Of course I am, but I'm also your attorney. Your father's will specified that his own firm should look after you. I know. I know. You pay my bills, my taxes, my expenses. You don't change the channels on the TV, but, hey, I have a remote for that. I spoke to the doctor and he said that... I'm not crazy. At least give him a call. I'll think about it. Thank you. I don't want the firm to think that their favorite associate isn't doing his job. There is something you can do for me. I want a roommate. What? You heard me the first time. I want a roommate. Why? I'm lonely. Ok, Camden. I'll set it up. All I want you to do is take out the ad. "Room for rent." I'll take care of everything else. Mr. Cusak will insist that I screen the applicants. No. I want to do that myself. I can't believe you're gonna let a total stranger in here when you won't even give me a key to your door. It's a first step. I need to do this. Alright, Camden. Just do me one favor. Rent it by the week and not by the month. I want to be in a position to get rid of anyone fast if it turns out that you don't like them. It's a deal. (rock music) Walkin' around inside this house and feelin' that there's no one around lookin' at the pieces of the past who would think he'd bring in from the rain I want you to call me. I want you to call me. I want you to call me. Call us at 1-900-555-EASY. We want to be your special friends. Call me now. Hello? Hi. What's your name? Jim. That's a nice name, Jim. I'm Susan. Glad to meet you, Susan. What do you do for a living? I'm a CPA. What's that? Teamster. Oh, wow! I love union men! I'll bet you drive all over the country. Do you call these numbers often? No, this is my first time. Listen, why don't we get together sometime? You can drive your truck over to my place. No can do, Pam. You see, I'm on the road an awful lot and... I only call this number because I need to hear a sexy voice to keep me going. Oh, cool! You rule! Yeah, well. It's been swell talking to you, babe, but I really gotta hit the road. Take care of yourself, Jim. I always do. (doorbell rings) (Two voices) Hello! We're here! I prefer somebody who doesn't smoke. I can't have any loud music here. I'll keep it low like it is now. I can't allow any parties. The only guest I'll ever have over is my boyfriend. Well, he alone would make a party. Hi, I'm Randy. I called about the apartment. Camden. Come on in. Thanks. Well this is the room in question. These doors slide shut so you get privacy. Wow, check out those legs. I have. You have? Well, through the telescope, I mean. So are these your parents? Yeah. I'm an orphan. Really? My parents died when I was 17. 10. So how much are you asking? $75 a week. One week in advance. Sounds reasonable. Is there anything you want to ask me? When can you move in? How about tonight? Okay. Oh, I do have to warn you about one thing. I never leave this apartment. Ever. That's cool with me. Look, here's $150. I'm going to go get my stuff. You want anything from outside? No thanks, I have everything I need delivered. Not anymore. Oh, you'll probably need these. Jesus, at least I'll be safe. Are you kidding? This is the safest apartment in the city. (hard rock music) I'm in. You're shitting me! I'm moving in tonight. Fuckin' A! Check this out. One's for the front door. The other three are for the apartment bolts. Paranoia will destroy ya. Why don't you go powder your nose, sweet thing. No problem. And save some of that shit for me! So, uh, what's the score? Man, that place is even sweeter than you said. We're gonna need a truck to haul off all that shit. Man, I knew that place was ripe for picking the minute I saw it. What about the freak? The guy's a total shut in. There's no way we're getting him out of there. I'm up for ideas. I'll get him fucked up. As soon as he passes out I'll let you in and we can clean the place out. We can fence that shit before he even wakes up. I guess you won't be delivering groceries for a while. Get this. That Korean bastard fired me. I guess somebody was complaining I was too nosy or something. I cut my hair for nothing. I wouldn't say that. Yeah, we cased a few great apartments. Jimmy, when you coming in? When I'm fucking ready. Let me tell you, it's costing me a fucking fortune to keep that bitch lit. When's she leaving? She's here to stay, bro. She never goes anywhere. She just sits around all day snorting her brains out. I don't get any privacy. Hey, man, let's get this straight. This isn't the joint. This is my crib and women are definitely allowed. You can stay here as long as you want but it isn't just you and me anymore. If you've got a problem with that then you can move out for real, got it? You know, it's gonna be cool staying somewhere else. Even if it is for just a few hours. Ha ha ha. No, no. This one's not like that. Yeah, I like him. He's friendly. Well, why don't you just swing by sometime and meet him. Oh, oh, okay. Alright, Donald. I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye. Hang on. Thanks. Sorry about that. It's cool. At least I don't have to worry about getting locked out if you're always home. Is that all your stuff. Yeah, I like to travel light. Well, I'm cooking some dinner. You like Chinese. I love it. Make yourself at home. Thanks. Are you tired of being alone to die? Then call the party animal line. All it takes is one phone call to make you the life of the party. If you wanna be a party animal, just dial 1-900-555-ROAR. Roar! You ever call one of those things? All the time. Heh. Me too. You ever use your real name? Hell no, that's half the fun. Yeah, I know what you mean. Camden, you ever get laid? Um, I came close once. In, in high school. But then my parents died. And it didn't work out. So how'd they die? Well, they were... going to a party... As soon as they stepped outside of this apartment some junkie shot them for my father's wallet. That's rough, man. At least you were raised by your parents. Mine died in a fire when I was just a kid. That must have been difficult. I spent years in foster homes getting into all kinds of trouble. Then a chick straightened me out. What was she like? She was hot and cool. What happened to her? She started to smother me so I had to fire her. Ha ha ha ha, yeah, I could stand a little bit of that. Chicks are great as long as you keep them in line. Friends are forever. (noises) Randy? Don't make a sound you little faggot or I'll blow your fucking brains out. Got it? Oh, shit. This guy delivered my groceries last week. He's collected his last tip. He didn't hide his face. He didn't care if I recognized him or not. He was gonna... kill me. If you'd moved in one day later I'd be dead now. You saved my life. It's my fault he got in. I left the window open. What are we gonna do with him? Call the cops. When they get here tell them the truth. Tell them he was gonna kill you unless I stopped him. When they get here? Or we could just go to the police station. No, no, no you don't understand. I don't want to let a policeman come in here but I can't go anywhere. I can't! Look! I know you don't me going to prison for saving your life. Of course I don't. Isn't there something else we can do? Alright. I'll deal with this in the morning. I hate pigs anyway. What now? We both need to get a good night's sleep. I can't sleep with a corpse in my living room. Here. Take these. What about you? You're not gonna sleep in here with that. Don't worry about it. (doorbell rings) (doorbell rings) (doorbell rings) Good morning, Camden. Wille! Hey! Saw your roommate. He told me you wanted bars on the windows? He did? He gave me $20 to take care of it right away. Oh, well, you can take care of it a little later. Hey, don't worry about it. I'm here now. Well, what's going on here? I decided to get a new carpet. Well, good for you. After I get done measuring the windows I'll get rid of it for you. No! I mean, Randy has a friend who wants this carpet. Well, I'll take it down to the lobby for you. Oh, well, he has to see it before he decides whether or not he wants it. Okay, Cam. You let me know. I will. (police sirens) Hey, stranger. How's it going? Popcorn? No. Can we just do this. I'm really busy. Too busy to talk to your old friend. You were never my friend, Larry. Even when we lived together. You were just a leech that was trying to suck me dry. Huh. Tell me how you really feel. It's nothing personal. You're just good at what you are. Take a taste. I don't do this shit anymore. It's for a lady friend. Sure it is. Enjoy the show. Enjoy the blow. Get the fuck out of here! Where the hell is Jimmy? He's tying up a few loose ends. Did you guys score last night? In more ways than one. He told me to give this to you. You guys should have called me. I was worried. Your worries are over. So did that super come by? Yeah. Don't you think it would've been a good idea to get rid of the body first? The sooner this place is totally secure the sooner you can sleep at night. That's true. Help me get our friend into the hall. What are we gonna do with him then? There's a big dumpster out front. He'll be landfill by morning. (doorbell rings) See who it is. It's my lawyer! Help me get him in the bathroom. Uh, just a second! Tell him I'm in the shower. Right. Donald! Hey, come on in. I, I ,I wasn't expecting you. You said to stop by and meet your roommate. Yeah, yeah, that's true, I did, didn't I? Is something wrong? You seem edgy. Huh? No, no, no, nothing's wrong. I'm a little tired is all. Randy and I were up late last night, talking. Just like a couple of fraternity brothers, eh? Heh heh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Where is he, anyway? At work? No, uh, he's... he's in the shower. What does he do anyway? He lives off his savings. Oh, is that so? Yeah, birds of a feather. I guess so. May as well make myself comfortable. Well, if you're sure you wouldn't rather come back at some later time? Mr. Cusak expects a full report from me. And I'm not leaving until I've met the subject of that report. Whatever you say. (water shuts off) Didn't take too long. Patience, my friend. Patience. Hey. Randy, this is my friend and lawyer, Donald Wood. Donald, this is Randy Carver. How you doing? Fine, and yourself? Great. I don't know if Camden mentioned it but I work for the law firm his father started. He hasn't said a word about it. I manage Camden's affairs. Camden's lucky to have people around who care about him. We're hitting it off great, aren't we, Cam? Yeah. Glad to hear that. I gotta get moving. It's nice to meet you. Likewise. So, what do you think? Seems friendly enough. Guess I'll be on my way. Well, be sure to tell Mr. Cusak I said hello. You got it, buddy. See you later. Are you tired of being rejected for superficial reasons? Do you want to meet someone who's real? Then call 1-900-555-REAL. You'll speak to a real person who wants to meet the real you. Hi, my name's Mike. Hi, I'm Julie. What do you do for a living, Julie? I work in an art gallery. How about you? I'm a lawyer. Oh. Do you have any hobbies? Actually, I'm an artist. Really? Hey, that's terrific. I really admire creative people. Really? I'm having an exhibit next week. Would you like to come? I'd love to see your work, but I really don't think I can make it. That's okay. I understand. Look, I've got to go. This was a mistake. Julie, wait. Are you there? Yes. My name isn't Mike. It's Camden. And I'm not a lawyer. I really don't know what I am. I make up different identities when I call these numbers to impress the women that I speak to. And I can't come see your exhibit because I never leave my apartment. I have agoraphobia. That's... I know what agoraphobia is. That was quite a confession, Camden. Look, this conversation is probably costing us both a fortune. Why don't you give me your number and I'll call you right back. I don't give my number out. Well then I'll give you mine. I don't know. It's 555-4503. (phone rings) Hello? Camden? Hi, Julie. (knock at door) Come in. What's up, Cam? I am. What do you want? I brought you a surprise. Have fun, buddy. She's all yours. For an hour, anyway. Hi, Camden. Hello. Your friend said you're a virgin. So, how would you like it? Uh, I, uh, I... I don't know. Well, aren't you gonna take your clothes off? Do you need some help? So are you gonna tell me what happened or what? Nothing happened. Bullshit! You had her in your room for two hours and I only paid for one. I couldn't get it up. So what did you do for two hours? We talked. Gloria's a very nice woman, actually. You fantasize about that bitch every night. How come you couldn't get it up? I guess I had other things on my mind. Yeah, like what? Like my date tonight. Your date? What are you talking about? I have a date. With a woman I met on the phone. You slick son of a bitch. So I'd appreciate it if you left early and came back late, huh? Hey, I'm outta here now. Hi. Hi. I'm Camden. I'm Julie. Nice to meet you in person. Same here. Come on in. Can I take your coat? Here. Would you like a drink? A beer would be great. Oh, coming up. That was delicious. Thank you. So what did you do before you started working at the gallery? I was one of those annoying people who sells subscriptions over the phone. I get all my subscriptions over the phone. We probably met. It didn't pay much but it was convenient. I could work out of my own apartment. So what made you decide to make the change. I don't know. I decided it was time to be around people again. I was spending all my time at home. Yeah, I know what that's like. So what do you want to do? I'm not going anywhere. There must be something you want to do outside these walls. I want to do everything outside these walls. You wanna dance? Yes. I'm sorry. I can't. Why, what's wrong. I can't explain it. Is it something I did? No, it's not you. It's me. I'm really sorry, I have to go. (knock at door) Come on in. Hey. So how'd it go, Romeo? Everything was going fine until I kissed her then should took off like I had AIDS. Maybe she's a virgin, too. Not likely. Is she frigid? Scared is more like it. Maybe she's damaged goods. I wouldn't let it get you down. I'm going go out and hang for a while. You wanna come? Yeah, right. Okay, man. You can't blame me for trying. I'll see you later. Yeah, you too. (screaming) Good morning, I'm Melanie White and this is the Manhattan Minute. What's so good about it, Melanie? Police are investigating the murder of a prostitute found earlier this morning in the Clinton area. Gloria Benson was brutally stabbed to death in what police are calling a sex related crime. Benson was 24 years old and there were no witnesses. In other news... (phone rings) Hello? Camden, it's Julie. I want to apologize for last night. That's okay, you don't have to. It... Yes, I do. I think you're a great guy and you deserve an explanation. I left my jacket at your place. If you don't mind I thought I'd stop by to get it and we can talk. Of course I don't mind. I'll stop by after work. See you then. Camden, you gonna let me in or what? Who pushed the panic button? She's dead! She's dead and her pimp was right outside and now he's gone and I thought you were him trying to... What are you babbling about? Gloria is dead. Who? The prostitute you brought me the other night! Her name was Gloria. Someone stabbed her to death. No shit. I was looking through my telescope and her pimp was looking right at me! Why would he do that? I don't know, maybe he thinks I killed her. Maybe I was her last customer and he thinks that I... He doesn't even know who you are. You're just being paranoid. What if I'm not being paranoid. You've got nothing to worry about. Trust me. But Julia's coming over tonight. Alright! Let me catch some Z's and I'm outta here. This isn't easy for me to say. Then don't say anything. It's not necessary. It's enough that you're here. You should know what you're getting into before we go any further. I carry a lot of emotional baggage. And I don't? At least you can talk about it. I can't even talk to my shrink. I was out on a date with this guy... and he raped me. I didn't press charges. Instead, I completely isolated myself. I still cringe when a man gets too close to me. I'm just really scared of getting hurt. I'm not gonna hurt you. I know. I like that painting. My lawyer gave it to me. A reminder of what I'm missing on the outside. He sounds like a good friend. From 9 to 5 he's a great friend. What about your roommate? He's cool. I'd like for you to see my paintings. I'd love to. Bring them over. And maybe we could go to a museum sometime. I'd love to go to a museum. But I can't. Not even with you. Well, let's not forget this. Now I don't have an excuse to come back. Well, we'll just have to come up with another reason. Hey! Relax, this is Randy. How ya doin'? Nice to meet you. Same here. Um, I have to go. Call me? You bet. Bye. See ya! Not bad! So, how far did you get? I owe you a pack of condoms. You're kidding! I don't believe it. Way to go, man. Now don't get all hung up on this chick. I don't want to see you get hurt. Now, what makes you think she'll hurt me. I'm not saying she will. I just want you to fall in love with the first chick you bag. Well, thank you for your concern, but I think I can take care of myself. Sure you can. Just take it slowly. Don't rush into anything. Okay? (upbeat pop music) (hip hop music) Yeah, what the fuck you want? Good morning I'm Melanie White and this is the Manhattan Minute. Police are investigating the slaying of a man found on the West Side. Lawrence "Missing Tooth" Jackson was shot five times with an automatic pistol in the same alley where a prostitute was murdered just three nights ago. Police are exploring the possibility of a link between the two murders. What are you lookin' at? Nothing. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. I'm going out. Maybe I should get myself a girlfriend. Then we can double date. In the kitchen or something. Heh heh. Hey, Randy. What did you do with the burglar's gun? Why do you ask? Just curious. Do you think it's smart carrying it around like that? You know what it's like out there, Cam. I have to protect myself. It's about time! I got here as fast as I could. What's this about? You were right, I shouldn't have gotten a roommate. What's wrong? Doesn't he flush the toilet? I can't explain. But you want him out. Definitely. That's all I need to hear. Well, at least he travels lightly. Yeah, he moves around a lot. God knows how many roommates he's had. (Door opens) Oh shit! Don't worry. I have everything under control. What's going on? You're moving out. Yeah? Why's that? Camden is uncomfortable with the current living situation. Is that the way it is, Cam? Yeah. I paid a hundred and a half upfront. Week isn't even out yet. Here's $200. We're sorry for the inconvenience. YOU... CAN'T... BUY... ME... OFF! That's it, Cam. Run and hide. Leave me with the dirty work as usual. You killed that pimp, didn't you? Of course, I did. You were shitting your pants. I did it for you! Did you kill Gloria for me, too? I paid that bitch to fuck you not talk your ear off. You're psychotic. I'm not psychotic. Look who I killed. A whore, her pimp and a lawyer. They were parasites. Go ahead, lock your door. Crawl under your bed and hide. Your world just got a lot smaller. You wanted a best friend? Well, you've got one for life. And I ain't going anywhere. You don't understand the responsibilities that go along with friendship. You never dump a friend for a chick. Never! Hey, Cam, you awake? I fixed you some dinner. You gotta be hungry. Alright, I'm just gonna leave it here. (phone rings) Hello? (Julie) Hi, is Camden there? Where else would he be? That isn't funny. Camden doesn't want to talk to anyone right now. Would you please tell him I called. Please? Yeah, whatever. Get in that closet, goddammit! You are gonna get such a beating when your father comes home! Come here, you little shit! I can't sleep. How about you? I didn't think so. I guess it wouldn't surprise you to learn that I was a pretty wild kid. My parents used to punish me a lot. My mother used to lock me in a closet for hours at a time. Total darkness. No matter how loud I screamed she wouldn't let me out. I guess that's when my claustrophobia started. My father used to beat me. One night he went too far. He almost beat me to death. So waited for them both to fall asleep. I snuck downstairs. I knew where he kept the kerosene. And I knew where my mom kept her cigarettes. I had my first smoke that night. They were toast by morning. Well, I better let you get some sleep. I'm taking off, Cam. You want anything? I guess not. Well, take it easy, man. And, uh, lock up after me. Goodbye, honey. Don't forget to do your homework. (doorbell rings) Hello? Camden, It's me, Julie. Can I please come up? Uh, I'm not feeling well. I'd really like to see you. It's not a good time. Is anything wrong? I have to take care of something. Will you call me later? If I can. Okay, I guess I'll talk to you later, then. Bye. (urinating) Happy Anniversary. Open this door, Cam! Open this fucking door! Open this goddamn door right now! Hwaaahh!!! That was really stupid, Cam. That was so stupid I'm gonna have to come up with a special punishment for you. Nice try, Cam. But I think it's time for you to come out of the closet. (CLICK!) Aaaaaaahhhhhh!!! Camden, let me out of here, you motherfucker! Camden, I'm begging you, man. Let me out of here. It's like a coffin in here, man! Let me out! Please, let me out! I promise I'll be good, man. Let me out! NO! I'm outta here. I got you your first blow job! Don't let her come between us! I'll give you back the remote control. Aaaaaahhhhh!!!!!! (heavy metal music) Every time I look around I can't understand Try to figure out how things got so out of hand It seems like only yesterday this place was so cool And now it seems that everyone is acting the fool All I need is a sensational What is I need is a sensational Sensational Sensational world! Sensational! Sensational world! Teacher says I see you brought your uzi to school And now I don't think that's an educational tool Leave your little toys at home and fight like a man And let's see how big and bad you are when it's hand to hand All I need is a sensational All I need is a sensational Sensational Sensational world! Sensational Sensational world! Everytime I look around I can't understand, try to figure out how things got so out of hand, all I need is a sensational all I need is a sensational Sensational Sensational world! Sensational Sensational world! Sensational Sensational world! (doorbell rings) Camden! My God, I can't believe you're here! What's going on? I had a fight with my roommate. Well, come on in. Where's your coat? I haven't needed one for years. I need a place to stay. Are you asking if you can stay here? Yes. Alright. But, you have to follow certain rules. No problem. You wash your own dishes and clean up after yourself. No problem. I choose what we watch on TV. Nnnnooo problem. And, you sleep in my bed. No problem. No, no! Leave them open. I've had it with doors! On TV: I'm Melanie White and this is the Manhattan Minute. Arson is expected in a blaze which left one man dead in Hell's Kitchen today. Firefighters responded to the four alarm fire on West 43rd Street at 5PM and were able to evacuate most of the tenants before subduing the fire. No! The only man who was unable to escape reportedly suffered from agoraphobia. God no! The fear of open spaces. This is a terrible tragedy. I don't how it happened. I just changed the batteries in the smoke detector a couple of weeks ago. Poor little buddy. I tried to help him, but there was fire everywhere. Oh God. I just carried what was left of his body out of here. God... (knock at door) (tapping on window) Ha ha ha ha ha! Jesus Christ! Look at you! Not a pretty picture, am I? Oh, Camden. I know, seven years bad luck. It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. I know. It's okay. Oh God. I'm sorry. Everything's okay. I don't want to ruin this but I'm so scared. I know. I know. Lie down. I'm going to go wash up. Julie... I'll be right back. (shower turns on) Hi, I'm Randy, I called about the apartment. The police are investigating the slaying of a man found on the West Side. YOU CAN'T BUY ME OFF! Wake up, Camden! Wake up! Shh! Not just yet, good buddy. I'm calling the shots around here. You get it? She's okay. Had to slap her around a little bit but she'll live. We had a nice talk. You know what 3000 battered women have in common? They don't fucking listen. How did you get out? You should have taken this. But I got to give you credit. That closet was a brilliant idea. I pissed all over myself. She's as screwed up as we are. I got news for you, Cam. This bitch has had one fucked up life. No wonder she found herself a nice harmless dude like you. But you're not harmless are you, Cam? You'd kill me right now if you could, wouldn't you? Thought so. Well, show Julie that you're not harmless. Give her a taste of what she really wants. Shut up, you fucking psycho! You gonna let her talk to me like that? Look, let her go. This is between you and me. Rape this bitch or I'll paint the wall with her blood. You give it to her good I might let you both go. Don't do it, Camden. I'd rather die! Teach her a lesson or I'll put a bullet in her head and fuck her through the hole. I mean it. I'm sorry. You gutless bastard. You don't need any directions from me, Cam. You know what to do. Only do it hard. No! Show time! Camden! Kill him! Go ahead, you pussy whipped bastard. Do it. Pull the trigger like she wants. Uh-uh. I'm not gonna kill you. Even though you deserve to die. I want you to suffer long and hard. I'm gonna call the cops. You'll like it in prison, Randy, I hear there's a lot of male bonding going on in there. How big do you think those cells are? Eight feet by ten feet? You're gonna spend the rest of your life in a closet, buddy. Yaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!! I didn't think you were gonna make it. You kidding? I was dying to get out of the apartment. Randy's voice: Chicks are great. As long as you keep them in line. Friends are forever. What's up motherfucker? You want some of
