AND THEY GO OUT TO PARTIES IN OTHER HOUSES AND IN TURN INVITE THEM BACK HERE TO PLAY? IT'S SO.

I GUESS THEY DIDN'T WANT TO WASTE THEIR TIME PLAYING WITH THE CHILDREN OF THE HOUSE. ANYWAY, WHO TAUGHT YOU TO RIDE A HORSE? IT WAS ME.

IT'S TOO LATE NOW. HE'S GOING TO TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE DEAD, AND NOBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE WANTS US TO KNOW. YOU SEE, YOUR MOM, WELL, SHE NEVER LIKED IT HERE AT BLY, AND YOUR FATHER WAS ALWAYS CHASING AFTER MECHANICAL INSTRUMENTS. YOU KNOW, HE LIKED ENGINES AND NOISE. WELL, ANYWAY, THEY WAS-- THEY WAS TRAVELING AROUND THE WORLD, AND THEY WENT TO INDIA, AND--AND ALL THE WAY TO THE TIP OF AFRICA, AND, UH... WELL, THEY HA--THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT, YOU KNOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN. THEY WERE DRIVING A GAS AUTOMOBILE MADE IN FRANCE.

YOU KNOW, I ASKED MISS JESSEL ABOUT THE DEAD, BUT I DIDN'T BELIEVE HER, NOT AFTER WHAT YOU HAD SAID. THAT'S RIGHT, AND IF SHE TOLD YOU THAT THE GOOD GO TO HEAVEN AND THE BAD TO HELL, SHE'S WRONG. IT'S ALL DAMN NONSENSE. YES. BUT...WHERE ARE MY PARENTS NOW, QUINT? WELL, AFTER, THEY--THEY BROUGHT THEM HOME. THEY PUT THEM IN A COUPLE OF BOXES, AND...

WELL, DADDY KNEW A LOT ABOUT HORSES, YOU SEE, BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW AS MUCH AS THE GYPOS DID, YOU KNOW. SO, HE--HE STEALS THIS DAMN THING AND HE TAKES ME IN THIS OLD COFFIN DRAGGER OVER BELFAST HIGHWAY TO BROUGHILL. THEY WAS HAVING A HORSE SALE OVER THERE. FAIRLY, YOU KNOW. OH, GOD. I--I'LL NEVER FORGET THE DAY HE TRIED TO-- HE TRIED TO SELL IT. HE'S GOT A BIG BAG OF OATS, YOU KNOW. HE'S PINCHED IT. THEN HE PUTS IN SOME SORT OF POWDER AND HE MIXES THE WHOLE DAMN THING UP. HE FEEDS IT TO THE HORSE TO GAS IT UP. [GIGGLING] LIKE THIS SO--SO THE BONES WON'T BE STICKING THROUGH. THE POOR THING HAD BALD PATCHES ON IT LIKE THAT. AND, UH, HE GLUES IT UP, YOU KNOW, AND HE CUTS OUT SOME RABBIT FUR AND HE STICKS IT ON THERE, AND THEN HE TARS IT UP WITH A BRUSH. TO GIVE IT A DAPPLE EFFECT, YOU KNOW. OH!

WELL, ME DAD TAKES THE HORSE, YOU KNOW. AND HE WALKS OVER TO HIM. OH, GOD, HE WAS FULL OF HIMSELF, YOU KNOW. AND HE SAYS, "GOOD EVENING TO YOU, SIR." HE SAYS, "YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK LIKE A MAN WHO KNOWS ABOUT HORSES." HE SAYS, "I CAN LET YOU HAVE THIS MAGNIFICENT BEAST FOR ONLY 5 SHILLINGS SILVER." HE SAYS, "IT'S JUST OFF THE BOAT FROM ARABIA." WELL, THE GYPO LOOKS AT HIM REAL QUICK, YOU KNOW, LIKE THAT. UP AND DOWN. THEN HE TAKES A LOOK AT THE HORSE. HE CAN'T SEE THE DAMN THING FOR THE GLOOM, YOU SEE. AND-- HA HA HA! WELL, GYPO SAYS, "I'LL GIVE YOU TWO FOR IT." WELL, ME DAD TAKES THE TWO REAL QUICK, YOU KNOW. WELL, THE GYPO JUMPS ON THE HORSE, THEN HE RIDES IT DOWN STRAIGHT INTO THE WATER. AND NO SOONER HE'S IN THE WATER, HE STARTS TURNING, YOU KNOW, BUCKING AND KICKING IT. AND FARTING! [LAUGHTER] I THOUGHT THE BRITISH WERE COMING. [LAUGHTER] WELL, THE RABBIT FUR FELL OFF OF IT AND THE PAINT WAS RUNNING DOWN HIS LEGS, AND THE BALD PATCHES WERE SHOWING THROUGH. AND THE PIECE OF GINGER FLEW OUT OF HIS-- FLEW OUT OF THE POOR ANIMAL'S ASS LIKE IT WAS SHOT FROM A CANNON. [LAUGHTER] WELL, MY DAD JUST SAT ME DOWN, YOU KNOW, AND HE'S TREMBLING AND HE'S TURNING WHITE AS A FISH AND PRAYING, OH, GOD. AND THE FIRST TIME HE'S LIKE, "WHERE ARE THEY TAKING ME?" AHH.

AND THEN YOU THINK REAL HARD ABOUT THE TARGET. AND IN YOUR MIND, YOU SEE THE ARROW GOING INTO THE BULL'S-EYE. AND THEN YOU FIRE IT! I DID IT! WELL, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. YOU ARE CLEVER, QUINT! FLORA! MISS JESSEL! SHALL WE WALK NOW? MAY I TALK TO YOU ABOUT PETER QUINT? THERE'S NO POINT, FLORA. WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO? I DON'T KNOW. BUT I DO THINK YOU SHOULD SEE HIM. I WILL NOT! ALL RIGHT, MISS JESSEL. I UNDERSTAND. MILES, WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME? ANYTHING, QUINT. WELL, I WANT TO SEE MISS JESSEL, BUT I'M FORBIDDEN BY OLD WRINKLE-ASS HERSELF. BUT I MUST SEE HER. YOU HATE MISS JESSEL, DON'T YOU, QUINT? OH, I HATE HER. IN THAT CASE, IF I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY, YOU LOVE HER. THAT'S RIGHT. I DO LOVE HER, LAD. THAT'S EASY. I CAN ARRANGE ANYTHING. CAN YOU DO IT? YES! GOOD LAD. COME ON, NOW. PUSH. HAH! HAH! PUSH! PUSH! CAN I KEEP IT TO PRACTICE WITH? WELL, LOOK AFTER YOURSELF. Miles, voice-over: THE CHINESE, QUINT. THEY FIRST SEE THE TARGET, THEN THEY PRETEND THEY HAVE HIT IT, BECAUSE THEY THINK HARD ABOUT IT. Quint, voice-over: THAT'S RIGHT. THEN THEY CLOSE THEIR EYES. AND FIRE! MILES! THAT COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS! Jessel: I WAS NEVER A CHILD AS YOU ARE-- SUCH A GRAND HOUSE, ABLE TO HAVE ANY DRESS OR TOY YOU LIKE. Flora: WHO WAS YOUR FATHER, MISS JESSEL? WHY, MR. JESSEL, OF COURSE. AND WHAT DID HE DO, MISS JESSEL? HE WAS A CHURCH SEXTANT. SUCH A TIMID MAN. SO GENTLE. BUT MY MOTHER LOVED HIM. WHY, MISS JESSEL? THEY WERE MARRIED 5 YEARS AFTER I WAS BORN. HE WAS NOT MY FATHER, YOU SEE. HE WAS JUST A... KIND LITTLE MAN. I UNDERSTAND. DO YOU LIKE KIND AND GENTLE PEOPLE, MISS JESSEL? HA HA HA! NOT ANYMORE, FLORA. WHEN MR. JESSEL DIED, MY MOTHER KILLED HERSELF. SHE LOVED HIM THAT MUCH. HE WAS SO CALM AND NICE. BUT WHEN HE WAS DEAD, MY MOTHER KNEW THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH? THE WORLD IS A VERY VIOLENT PLACE. NOTHING IS TRULY CALM. EVEN WHEN YOU'RE DEAD, YOU BRING PAIN. FLORA, NO, DON'T! FLORA! IT'S ALL RIGHT, MISS JESSEL. OHH. WHY, YOU'VE TURNED WHITE. I CANNOT SWIM, AND I THOUGHT... I WAS AFRAID. IT'S ALL RIGHT, MISS JESSEL. I CAN SWIM, AND I WOULD HAVE SAVED YOU. QUINT SAYS HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN EVER, AND THAT IT'S ALL OVER, HE SAYS. MILES, DON'T! HE SAYS THAT HE DOESN'T CARE ANYMORE, AND THAT YOU OUGHT TO ROT. MILES, DON'T HIT THE BALL AGAIN LIKE THAT. SO AS FAR AS HE'S CONCERNED, HE HAS, OR HE SAYS, WASHED HIS HANDS OF YOU. [HITS CROQUET BALL] WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT, MISS JESSEL? YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO HIT MY BALL INTO THE HEDGE LIKE THAT. BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY? ABOUT QUINT? I DON'T BELIEVE IT. HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOU ANYMORE, MISS JESSEL. IF THAT'S TRUE, HE SHOULD TELL ME SO. TO MY FACE. CATCH! THAT'S EASY. I CAN ARRANGE EVERYTHING. [PIANO PLAYING, PEOPLE LAUGHING] AHH. Flora: QUINT! QUINT! AH, FLORA. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I CAME TO SEE YOU, TO TELL YOU-- TO SEE OLD QUINT? TO TELL YOU THAT I'D SEEN MISS JESSEL. SHE LOVES YOU. GET YOUR RUDE ASS OUT OF HERE. SHE LOVES YOU, QUINT. WHO? MISS JESSEL. SHE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU, AND THAT SHE THINKS OF NOTHING BUT YOU, AND THE DAY WHEN YOU'LL BE TOGETHER. Quint: YOU WOULDN'T LIE TO ME. Flora: OH, NO. AND THAT YOU MUST MEET HER, AND SHE'LL FORGIVE YOU. OH, IS THAT TRUE? AND THAT YOU'RE KIND AND GENTLE. SHE LOVES YOU-- SHE LOVES YOU WITH ALL HER BEING. OH, HOW PRETTY YOU MAKE THE WORDS. WHAT ELSE DID SHE SAY? WHAT OTHER LIES DID SHE TELL YOU? Miles: MRS. GROSE! I'LL HELP YOU UP. OH, DEAR. I'M TERRIFIED OF HEIGHTS. GIVE ME YOUR HAND, MRS. GROSE. IT'S QUITE SAFE. GIVE ME YOUR BASKET. HERE WE ARE. OHH. YOU GO ON UP, MILES. I THINK I'M ALL RIGHT NOW. I'LL FOLLOW YOU UP. OH, YOU CAN BE SUCH A CHARMING YOUNG MAN WHEN YOU WANT, INVITING ME INTO THE TREE HOUSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ON THE CONTRARY, IT'S MY PLEASURE. HERE WE ARE. ISN'T IT NICE IN HERE. QUINT BUILT IT FOR US. IT TOOK HIM 4 MONTHS. IS MISS FLORA TO JOIN US? I'M SURE SHE IS. I REMEMBER AS A CHILD WHEN WE WERE-- [THUMP] WHAT WAS THAT? THERE ARE SQUIRRELS HERE, YOU KNOW. BUT I DID HEAR SOMETHING. IT COULD BE JUST... WHAT? I'LL GO AND LOOK. RIGHT. Grose: CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING? MILES, BE CAREFUL. RIGHT. WHERE ARE YOU, DEAR? JUST A MOMENT. UNH! BE A GOOD BOY, MILES, AND COME BACK AND FINISH YOUR TEA. THAT I SURELY WILL. HA HA HA! NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE AT? MILES? MILES? MILES!! DEAR GOD, HE'S TAKEN THE LADDER AWAY! OH, MILES! OH, HELP ME! [COUGHS] [SNIFFS] GOOD EVENING, QUINT. GOOD EVENING, LAD. YOUR HAIR, IT DOES LOOK TIDY. DO YOU LIKE IT? I TOLD YOU I'D ARRANGE EVERYTHING. GOOD LUCK, QUINT. [WHISPERING] THEY'RE UP THERE. [WHISTLING] [FOOTSTEPS] HOW SMART YOU LOOK. SO CLEAN. YOU SEE, I DIDN'T BELIEVE FOR ONE MINUTE THAT YOU CARE NOTHING FOR ME. IT WAS JUST A LIE, WASN'T IT? LIES? PART OF IT LIES. YOU HAD TO SEE ME. THAT'S RIGHT. AND YOU DIDN'T RISK LOSING THE WORK HERE, ISN'T THAT TRUE? AND YOU KNOW THAT ALL MRS. GROSE HAS TO DO IS TO WRITE ONE NOTE TO THE MASTER, AND YOU'RE FINISHED HERE. YOU KNOW THAT. THAT DOESN'T SUIT YOU. IT LOOKS...UNCOMFORTABLE. [THUNDER] HOW HOT YOU ARE. HAVE YOU BEEN RUNNING? NOT RUNNING, MARGARET. I'M NOT FRIGHTENED, QUINT. I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT, AND IT'S ALL RIGHT. HOW STRONG YOU ARE. IS THAT HOW YOU LIKE TO APPEAR? DARK AND COLD, AS IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE EVIL. YES? AND ALL I WOULD HAVE TO DO-- DID YOU EVER THINK ON THAT?-- WAS TO SCREAM OUT BUT ONCE, OR TO RUN DOWN TO THE VILLAGE, THE POLICEMEN THERE. IT WOULD HAVE MEANT JAIL, QUINT. YEARS. I COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID TO ME IN THE BEGINNING. [THUNDER] NO. WHY NOT? WHAT HAVE I GAINED BY MY SILENCE? MYSELF. BUT YOU'VE JUST TOLD MILES YOU CARE NOTHING, THAT YOU'D END IT NOW. AND THIS IS THE LAST OF IT, ISN'T IT? TONIGHT. AS YOU WISH. OH, I DO. LOOK, I HAVE NO FEAR. I AM FREE. IT IS DONE. [THUNDER] SEE, QUINT? HOW LITTLE IT MATTERS. I NEED YOU WITH ME, MARGARET. I NEED YOU TO STAY WITH ME. TO LIVE WITH YOU IN YOUR PIGSTY? I'LL GIVE YOU PIGSTY. OH! OH! UNH! OH! UNH! I'M NO PIG! Quint: I'M NO PIG! UNH! [CREAKING] WHO'S DOWN THERE? WHO IS IT? PETER QUINT. Grose: QUINT? QUINT! GET ME DOWN FROM HERE AT ONCE. YOU HEAR ME? YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS, MY MAN. QUINT! OH, IT'S YOU, MASTER MILES. HELP ME DOWN, I PRAY YOU. NEVER FEAR, MRS. GROSE. I'LL HAVE YOU DOWN IMMEDIATELY. GOOD BOY. Grose: MISS JESSEL? MISS JESSEL, I HAVE LOOKED EVERYWHERE THIS MORNING FOR MASTER MILES AND MISS FLORA. THEY WERE UP EARLIER. THEY WENT TO THE LAKE FOR SOMETHING. I WANT YOU TO KNOW, MISS JESSEL, THAT I AM SOLID WORRIED ABOUT THEM. THEIR GENERAL BEHAVIOR, AND WHAT THEY DID TO ME YESTERDAY. AND THOUGH I WAS TOLD NOT TO CONTACT THE MASTER, I FEEL THAT I MUST. I THINK MILES' BEHAVIOR OUTRAGEOUS WHAT HE DID TO YOU. BUT YOU MUST SEE IT IN THE LIGHT OF A PRANK, DON'T YOU THINK? ARE YOUR EYES WEAK THIS MORNING, MISS JESSEL? NO, WHY? I WAS JUST WONDERING WHY-- WHY WHAT? WHY YOU SHOULD NEED TO WEAR A VEIL IN THE HOUSE? [GASPS] YOU SLUT. AND IT WAS ALL A TRICK AGAINST ME. [FLORA SCREAMS] [FLORA SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] AAH! [FLORA SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Grose: THE DEVIL! THE DEVIL IS IN BOTH OF YOU! GOD FORGIVE YOU! Miles: LET GO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I SEE WITH MY OWN EYES? YOU NEARLY KILLED FLORA, YOU LITTLE DOG! DAMN YOU, YOU OLD WOMAN! YOU STOPPED ME! Jessel: FLORA! DID YOU STOP? DID YOU STOP? YOU INTERFERED! MILES WAS RIGHT! DAMN YOU! THE POINT WAS, BUT YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND! IT WAS A GAME! I WAS MEANT TO DIE! A GAME? TO DIE? AND YOU RUINED IT! AND YOU WANTED TO DIE? Flora: OH, YES!! [FLORA CRYING] WELL? WHAT TO SAY? THEY SAW YOU LAST NIGHT. WITH HIM. YES. THEY REPEATED EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID. NO! OH, YES, THEY DID. EVERYTHING. THEY CANNOT COPY EVERYTHING BECAUSE THEY CANNOT KNOW THAT... THEY ARE STILL CHILDREN. THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND THAT WHATEVER I HAVE DONE... IF YOU LIKE, WHATEVER WICKEDNESS I HAVE DONE... IT WAS WITH LOVE. AND THINK YOU NOW-- NOW YOU HAVE SEEN WITH YOUR OWN EYES WHAT COMES OF IT-- IT IS STILL LOVE? I BEG YOU NOT TO. HAD MISS FLORA DIED, AND BY MILES' HAND, MARGARET, HAVE YOU THOUGHT? [CLOCK CHIMES] I COULD HAVE PITIED YOU ONCE... BUT NOW... I SHALL WRITE TO LONDON. EITHER YOU MUST GO AND NEVER COME BACK, OR SURELY YOU WILL BE SACKED FROM HERE. OH, THE IGNOMINY. [SOBBING] [CLOCK TICKING] THERE ARE NO LESSONS TODAY, FLORA. I'M AFRAID I'M-- AND WHY NOT? ARE YOU ILL, MISS JESSEL? I'M TIRED. I NOTICE THAT NOTHING IS WRITTEN ON THE BLACKBOARD. FLORA! AND THAT YOUR EYES ARE RED AND PUFFY, AS IF YOU'VE BEEN CRYING. WHAT IF I HAVE? MAY I ASK YOU ARE YOU IN GREAT PAIN? LET ME HELP YOU. TOO LATE, FLORA. BUT WHY? BECAUSE I AM ILL. BUT I AM NOT. YOU LOVE HIM. NO. PLEASE. YOU DO. I HATE. THEN--THEN YOU DO LOVE. BUT YOU CRY, MISS JESSEL. DO YOU HURT SO? DON'T WORRY SO FOR ME. BUT I DO. IF ONLY YOU COULD UNDERSTAND HOW CRUEL I'VE BEEN TO YOU AND THAT I DID NOT KNOW I WAS TO MISLEAD YOU. BUT YOU HAVEN'T AT ALL. ON THE BLACKBOARD, I WRITE THE GRAMMAR AND THE SPELLING AND ALL THE NICE WORDS. [INHALES DEEPLY] I DID NOT MEAN TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING ELSE. YOU MEAN QUINT? I'M SO ASHAMED. YOU SEE, I CAN HELP YOU. NO. IT WILL ALL END. LET ME HELP YOU. WON'T YOU LET ME? I WILL GO. GO, MISS JESSEL? YOU MUST NOT GO. YOU MUST STAY. I CAN ARRANGE ANYTHING. I CAN TELL QUINT AND HE WILL MEET YOU. NO. JUST ONCE BEFORE YOU GO. I LOVE QUINT, BUT YOU CANNOT HELP ME. Miles: COLD! YOU'RE COLD! CAN'T CATCH ME! HA! COME ON NOW! HERE! CAN'T CATCH ME! [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHS] I'LL EAT YOUR LIFE! MISSED! HA! COME ON NOW! GOT IT! AAH, ME HAT! I'LL GET YOU! [LAUGHING] GOT YOU NOW! HA HA. OH, GOD. IT'S MY TURN NOW. OH, NO. OH, NO. GOTTA REST A BIT. [PANTING] WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT DYING, QUINT? HUH? WHAT? WHAT? WELL, WHERE'S THE DEAD GO, QUINT? THE DEAD? THEY DON'T GO NOWHERE. THEY GOT NOWHERE TO GO. AAH. BUT HOW DO YOU MEET THEM? IF YOU WANT TO MEET THEM, YOU'LL HAVE TO DIE YOURSELF. SO, THE DEAD PEOPLE MEET EACH OTHER? THAT'S RIGHT. BUT DO THEY LOVE EACH OTHER? SURE. OF COURSE THEY DO. BUT LIVE PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER, TOO. WELL... I SUPPOSE SO. BUT SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO TELL. WELL, YOU SEE, IF... IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE, YOU WANT TO KILL THEM. PLEASE. SAY IT AGAIN, QUINT. WELL, IF YOU REALLY... IF YOU REALLY LOVE SOMEONE, SOME TIMES YOU... YOU REALLY WANT TO KILL THEM. I ORDERED A DRIVER. I'M SENDING... ALL OF THIS UP TO LONDON IN ADVANCE. BY TOMORROW, I SHALL BE GONE. [BIRDS CAWING] [NICKERING] I PUT THE CASES ON THE COACH, MADAM. THANK YOU. [WHISPERING] You stay here, and I'll give you a signal from the tower. QUINT? OH, PETER, DID YOU THINK I WOULD LEAVE YOU WITHOUT A WORD? [GASPS] PETER! PETER! PLEASE, HELP ME! HELP ME, PETER, HELP! [SCREAMS] [SCREAMING] PETER, HELP! PETER! [PANTING] WE DON'T WANT YOU TO GO! [GASPING] WE WANT YOU TO STAY WITH US. YOU SEE, YOU MUST STAY. WE LOVE YOU. [DOOR OPENS] AH, YOU'VE GOT THE LAKE. IT'S THE WRONG SHAPE. IT WILL DO. ALL OF THESE ARE THE TREES THINGS? THEY GO ALL AROUND THE LAKE. YOU PUT THE ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE... THESE ARE THE REEDS. DOESN'T LOOK MUCH LIKE REEDS TO ME. USE YOUR IMAGINATION. THE BOAT. IT'S GOT A HOLE IN IT. WHAT'S THE USE OF A BOAT WITH A HOLE IN IT? SO IT WILL SINK. WHAT'S THIS? GIVE IT TO ME. THIS IS MISS JESSEL. I MADE IT. OH. SHE'S DROWNING. AND THE DUCKS, PLEASE, FLORA. I WASN'T GOING TO USE THEM. AND WHY NOT? YOU MADE THEM WRONG. I DID NOT. DUCKS ARE WHITE. THERE IS NO WHITE. A GREEN AND RED DUCK IS OUT OF THE QUESTION. LOAD OF ROT. I MADE THEM. I HATE THEM! FLORA! [SOBBING] FLORA! NOW YOU SPOILED IT. OH, NO. QUINT! [SLAMS DOOR] GET UP! QUINT! YOU WILL GO, QUINT, AND TODAY-- BECAUSE I HAVE WRITTEN! AND THAT'S THE END OF IT. [BELL CHIMES] NOW THAT I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL I KNOW, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU GO DOWN TO BLYE HOUSE IMMEDIATELY. YES, SIR. AS THE FORMER YOUNG WOMAN LEFT SO SUDDENLY, I BELIEVE IT WAS IN ANSWER TO AN URGENT CALL FROM HER FAMILY-- A RELATIVE WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN SUDDENLY SICK. THE CHILDREN ARE LEFT ALONE VIRTUALLY-- JUST WITH A HOUSEKEEPER AND THE GARDENER. I UNDERSTAND. HAVE YOU ANY QUESTIONS? UNLESS THE CHILDREN ARE TAKEN VERY SICK INDEED OR THERE HAS BEEN AN ACCIDENT IN THE HOUSE, I MUST ON NO ACCOUNT GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU. ON NO ACCOUNT. AND THE WELFARE AND TUTORING OF THE CHILDREN REMAINS IN MY CARE. IT DOES IN TOTAL. BUT YOU WILL REQUIRE A REPORT OF THE-- FROM TIME TO TIME. IF YOU LIKE, EVERY 6 MONTHS. I AM A BUSY MAN, AND... FORTHWITH THEN. I AM SO GRATEFUL. THE BUTLER WILL SEE YOU OUT. [GOOSE HONKING] [GASPS] Grose: HERE, MILES. HERE ARE YOUR PRUNES. YES, MRS. GROSE. WE DON'T OFTEN SIT HERE, DO WE? NO. NO. A SPECIAL OCCASION. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. WELL, MILES AND FLORA, NOW, FIRSTLY, AS YOU ALREADY HAVE GATHERED, MISS JESSEL HAS SUDDENLY LEFT US. SHE HAS? YES, MILES. ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE HAD TO LEAVE TO SEE A RELATIVE WHO HAS BECOME VERY ILL. SHE HAD? WHY WEREN'T WE TOLD OF THIS, MRS. GROSE? I... SHE DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET YOU. SHE WANTED TO... JUST LEAVE. WELL, YOU KNOW HOW VERY FOND SHE WAS OF YOU BOTH. AND THAT IS WHY SHE DIDN'T SAY GOOD-BYE. VERY WELL. SHE ASKED ME TO CONVEY TO YOU HER MOST SINCERE GOOD WISHES AND FOR THE FUTURE. ARE WE TO UNDERSTAND SHE WILL NEVER COME BACK? TRUE, FLORA, BUT-- HOW PERPLEXING. WHAT IS, MY DEAR? 'CAUSE SHE WILL COME BACK. OH, ON THE CONTRARY. SHE HAS TO. FLORA, I-- SHE HAS NOWHERE TO GO. THEREFORE, SHE CAN ONLY STAY. THEREFORE... A NEW GOVERNESS WILL BE ARRIVING IN HER STEAD. THEREFORE, MISS JESSEL HAS-- WHAT WAS THAT YOU SAID, MRS. GROSE? I SAID, MASTER MILES, YOU ARE TO MEET A NEW TUTOR. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. MISS JESSEL WOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN. MISS JESSEL HAS GONE. [DOG BARKING DISTANTLY] WOULD YOU BE SO KIND, I'D LIKE SOME MORE PRUNES. CHEESE FOR ME, PLEASE. [DISTANT LAUGHTER] [GRUNTS] I'M SORRY, QUINT. [GROANING] PLEASE KEEP STILL. IT WON'T BE LONG. MISS JESSEL'S WAITING. [GRUNTS] COME ALONG, CHILDREN! COME DOWN! WHOA! WHOA, NOW. WELCOME TO BLYE HOUSE, MY DEAR. THANK YOU. YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY HERE. I'M SURE I WILL. THE JOURNEY, WAS IT TIRING? NO, IT WAS VERY PLEASANT. WELL, WELL, WELL, WELL! AND HERE WE HAVE MISS FLORA AND MASTER MILES. YOUR NEW GOVERNESS, MY DEARS. YOU COULD NOT HOPE TO MEET IN ALL YOUR LIFE MORE EXQUISITE YOUNG ANGELS AS ARE MILES AND FLORA. GOOD AFTERNOON. WAS IT A PLEASANT JOURNEY YOU HAD? THANK YOU, FLORA. IT WAS. MILES, DEAR? Miles: HELLO.
