[whooshing] - [Man] No! [gunshot firing] [alarm blasting] [tense music] [eerie whimsical music] [chaotic music] [eerie whimsical music] [chaotic music] - [Man] When I think about how I got here, four years of trials, two appeals. It's kind of ridiculous. I guess I know where my tax dollars went. I've been here so long I could barely remember a time before it. A time when I had a life. I had a great job, beautiful wife, loving family. Yeah. I had it all. - [Boss] You should be back on the job. - One minute I was talking to my boss. I wanted earlier retirement, he disagreed. The next thing I knew I was being taken out of the building by the fucking police. Turns out some psychopath killed 12 kids in the building's daycare center. My boss's kid was one of them so naturally, I became the prime suspect. It's been almost 15 years since that day. Time, it can do a funny thing to a man sitting on death row. They treat us like shit 'cause they think we're monsters. For the most part, they're right. But there's more to it than that. It's like the world forgot about us. No letters from home. No interviews, book deals. Just a bunch of sadistic bastards. - [Man] I've never seen an animal torture another animal just for kicks, have you? - [Man] That's true. - [Man] If it was up to me, this fucker would be dead today. One shot to the head, bam, done. [extremely tense music] - [Inmate] And no screams. No screams that come from beyond that door. It's like nothing I ever heard. [door slamming] We'll get together. [whistling] - [Man] Can I have some? [man cackling] - Oh, we have some fine food today. Oh let me just a little more juice. Ah. Oh yeah, hah. Gonna, gonna be calling the governor, that means you're an innocent man. Well Joe, you come and get your food now. Yeah. Oops. Oh. There's tomorrow. [whistling] [groaning] [screaming] [prisoner whimpering] - Can I have some? Can I have some? - Can you have some what? - I want some food, please. - You want some food? - Yeah. - Oh, how hungry are you? [somber piano music] - Do you know what time it is, gentlemen? Well no, of course you don't. I had all the clocks removed. Time to stretch those legs. Time to get to know one another just a bit better. [buzzing] - Everybody out! Let's go, out, out! Everybody out! - [Guard] Is it a good idea to have all these maniacs out together? - Well the warden's what you might call a, an eccentric genius. The whole place, it's all electrified. The bars. The floors. The toilets. - The fucking toilets? - Nah. [chuckling] - Oh by the way, Sammy. Since you can't run and play like all the other boys, you and I will be spending some quality time. - [Sammy] No, no please. - [Guard] Come on! - [Sammy] Don't make me go back there! Please don't! I beg you, I beg you, I beg you please! Don't make me go back there. Help me! No, please, no! - You'll be all right. Just like yesterday. - No, no. No! I can't go back ,please. Please help! [crying and screaming] [door slamming] [man screaming] - Hey. Bones, hey. You doing all right, man? - Not so good, Sully. I haven't eaten in four days. And I'll get through this, though I've been through worse. - What the hell could be worse than this, huh? - War. Sully, anyways. You know that guard, the one that pisses in the food? - Yeah. - Lately that's not all I've been getting in mine. - Shit that's fucking disgusting, look. Go in my cell, I have some food from last night. It's cold, you can have it, all right? - Thanks, man. I appreciate that. - You need it more than me. Go, eat, eat please. - Slayeth the evil that lives inside you. Where they are walking ,the devil walks too. - [Richie] Fuck off, not today. - Slayeth the evil that lives inside you, where they are walking, the devil walks too. - Tudley, not today! - Duh duh! We know what you did. - Tudley, get out of here! - We know what you did! - Hey! - Go! [Tudley laughing] Goddamit, get the fuck away from me. - Hey. How many times have I told you? Get your ass over there. Get over there! [tense music] Oh, you're an idiot. Close number two. [buzzing] - No! [screaming] [zapping] - Bones! Bones, no! Somebody help him! Jesus Christ, Bones! No! Murphy, you sack of, [grunting] - Close door three. - Bones. [screaming] - No, no, no! No, no! [screaming] [screaming] - You monsters! - Ah. Alvarez. Hey! I said clean up that mess now. Hey! Hey. Come clean this shit up. Put him back in his cage when you're done. I'm going home for dinner. [soft piano music] - Mr. Sullivan, I'm afraid there's been an accident. Someone will be by soon to tidy up your cell. - Sully. - I never should have let you go in the cell to get the food. I'm sorry. - Slayeth the evil that lives inside you. Where they are walking, the devil walks too. Slayeth the evil that lives inside you. Where they are walking, the devil walks too. [laughing] Richie! We know what you did! We know what you did! We know what you did! - Richie, where are you, you little brat? You can't hide from me. Bitch. Probably faggot, find your fat little faces. You can't, I can hear you sniffling in there! I can hear you! [kid crying] Stop crying! Stop crying! [kid shouting] Shh! Shut up! - [Kid] Make it stop, Richie, make it stop. - [Woman] Shut up! - Make it stop. [retching] - Bones. I'm sorry. - It's about time you opened the damn door. I was standing out there all day. Not getting any younger. Ugh. - [Guard] Look, just go clean up, the stench is impossible. [whistling] - [Janitor] Open three. [whistling] Wowee, have we some mess here. [whistling] [chuckling] [ominous music] [screaming] - We know what you're doing. Let me through. [laughing] Yeah! - Let's go! - Come on, put the mop down, back up! - Come on! [bashing] [Richie groaning and screaming] - Get in there. [bashing] [whimpering] - [Tudley] But I appreciate everything you done. Sullivan! I really liked right there. Have a panache! I've said it before, I'll say it again. Slayeth the evil that lives inside you. Where you are walking the devil walks too. [chains clanking] - You've been a naughty boy. I do apologize for the mess. The visit was unexpected. - No. More know [mumbling] You're gonna die. No, no. More know [mumbling] - [Warden] Not now, Sammy. - [Sammy] I gave you that ice cream, didn't I? I gave it to you for free. [sobbing] - Mr. Sullivan. Have you ever heard of the Achilles Heel? Everyone has one. Let's find yours, shall we? Oh. [screaming] - [Richie] Oh, no! [slapping] [groaning] - Well then. This little piggy liked pigtails. This little piggy liked curls. This little piggy liked ice cream. The screams of sad little girls. And this little piggy. [screaming] All the way to the electric chair. That's enough fun for one day. [light piano music] - Oh my god, oh my god. Oh, thank you, thank you. [groaning] - [Guard] Come on buddy, come on. Time to count some sheep. It's sleepy time. - Tommy? - Sleepy time for you today. There you go. Right down there. - Tommy. Don't shut the door. Tommy. Don't leave me in here. My Camry. I don't have any time. It's stretching. - Make him scream. - [Richie] I never hurt anybody! - Never had a chance to, to read your file. I uh, I know what pain is. I have a girl. I have a little girl. And I read that um, that you took a knife and you rip their clothes off. You raped them. You made them bleed. And then you just plunged a knife into them. I was trying to, you know, I don't understand how a man could do that. When the little girl started bleeding for her life, stands and shivers with fear. Did you kill them kids? - No. I couldn't. That's not me. - They say that your mummy died. I think you raped her too first. And I think she squealed like the little kids. - Slayeth the evil that lives inside you. Where they are walking, the devil walks too. - Right over there. Murphy. Hey Murph? Can you see this? That's what I'm talking. That's what I'm talking. Murph! Murphy! You asked me if I'm innocent, just look over there. Murphy! Look! Look at what I'm looking at. Him, walking, Tudley. I don't have it in me. I cannot have that in me! Murphy! Murphy! - Shh, what is it, shh. Sullivan. Sullivan, can you hear me, Sullivan? Sullivan, can you hear me, Sullivan? We know what you did. We know what you did. Sullivan. Slayeth the evil that lives inside you. Where they are walking the devil walks too. Walking, walking, walking. The devil walks too. [screaming] - You're right, Mr. Sullivan. Mr. Tudley has worn out his welcome. But shall it be electrocution? Cutting, chopping? Surely we can be more creative than that. Bring him to me, gentlemen. - [Tudley] Slayeth the evil that lives inside you. They are walking, the devil walks too. [cackling] Slayeth the evil that lives within. They all do. Thunderous applause! - Tudley, times up, let's go. - Open door two. [buzzing] Let him out, he's gotta get. Get up, you pain in the ass. Haha, there's a pun. Get up, Tudley. Get up! Get up, get up, get up, gah! [screaming] - Slayeth the evil that lives inside you, where they are working the devil walks! - Fucking rat. - [screaming] Murphy! Murphy! - Attaboy. [Tudley groaning] [heaving] - Yes. It's your big day. So exciting. Did you say it to all your victims? Hmm? Was it the last thing they ever heard? All 15 of them? [choking] Mr. Tudley. [coughing] No, no, no. You deserve more. You deserve so much more for all you've done. So much more. So much more. So much more. Yes. So much more. So much more. [whimsical music] - Thank you. Oh, oh! Murphy. - Say aw, aw, come on. Oh, say oh. Ha, oh, there you go. - [Tudley] Oh, oh! - I got an opening. Okay. - Murphy, what are you doing? - Get the fuck out of here now. Out! - Oh! - Close your eyes and you're gonna get a big surprise. Oh, suck on that. - Better half. You're up. What do you want? - [Tudley] Hold up! - Hey, hey, hey, hey. You didn't think about this part, did you? [Tudley groaning] Look at me, look at me! Now go this way, this way, this way, this way! - Yeah, get some. [screaming and sobbing] - Oh, no, no, no, no. Jungle time. - Oh yeah, there you go. [Tudley screaming] [grunting] - In it! [Tudley whimpering] [bashing] [choking] - I'm gonna be gentle now. [screaming] [choking] [chuckling] You're better when you're dead. [snorting] [whistling] - Ooh, goddamn! I've never seen him scared shitless. [laughing] Who thought he would have lasted that long? - Seriously I thought I was gonna shit myself when he woke up. Think I'd bite my fucking finger right off. - This kind of shit happen often? - Hey, hey, hey! Die, you fucking asshole. - I heard what you did, you fucking monsters. - [Guard] Says the fucking child killer, right? - How can you go home to your families after what you did, how can you look at your wife and your kids in the face, hmm? With a fucking smile? Murph, you surprise me. - No, I'm innocent, just like you. - Tudley will no longer be a problem, Warden. - [Warden] The room is being cleaned? - I got the new guys on it. Gotta break them out eventually. - [Warden] You were speaking to Mr. Sullivan earlier. - Yeah. He just can't seem to keep his big mouth shut. - [Warden] When the time comes, we'll have to be very careful with Mr. Sullivan. He seems to be more aggressive than the inmates we've dealt with in the past. - He bit my hand. I'm assuming he was trying to eat. - [Warden] How long has it been? - [Richie] Why the hell did he even let go? - The fuck are you gawking at? Still crying like a little bitch. - Where the hell did you get that? - Guards gave it to me. Showed them my tits. [coughing] For fuck's sake. Get that high and mighty expression off your goddamn face. Child killer. - What the fuck did you just say? - There's the little bastard I know. Angry, violent, aggressive. And a coward. - You don't know fuck all about me! - Hmm? Ah, you're right. Takes a real man to kill 12 innocent children. - I didn't do it. I'm innocent. - You never drove the ice cream truck? Ice cream, you scream, children scream for ice cream. You didn't enjoy lurking in the park, raping your way through July? - Shut up. Shut up! Shut up, shut up, shut up! - Shut up! I never hurt anyone. - Children? [woman laughing] That's evil. - I never hurt a soul. - I'm not evil. [laughing] - Shut up. [coughing] Why are you here? - I'm innocent. - I'm innocent. - [Man] I'm going to work. Somebody has to. - Oh fuck you, what's that supposed to mean? I didn't want this. - Let's go hide. - By the way, I didn't want this home in the suburbs bullshit. That was your dream, not mine! - Well what, so I'm some kind of fucking asshole? - Yes. - 'Cause I don't want my kids to grow up in the fucking ghetto? - You've never set foot in the ghetto! - I live in the fucking ghetto. [woman screaming] - How dare you?! How dare you! [sobbing] - I'm going to fucking work! - Go, your whore is waiting! - Leave me in the fucking wash. [sobbing] - Where are you boys? [phone ringing] - Governor? No sir, thank you for calling me back so quickly. Have you considered yet? Oh no sir, I understand. No sir, of course you have to do what you feel is right. Well thank you. You too. All the best to your family as well. Bye. Bastard. Bastard. Oh, Richie. - Water. Thank you. [slurping] - It's all right, okay. - Thank you. Thank you. - Come here. You're a mess. The governor denied the stay. - [Richie] How long? - [Warden] 36 hours. - I'm innocent. You know that. How did we get here? There's no more time? Don't shut the door. Don't shut the door. There's no more time. There's no more time! There's no more time, there's no more time. I don't have time. I don't have time. I don't have time. No more time. - [Murphy] You wanted to see me sir? - Yeah, Sullivan's not eating? - [Murphy] That's true, sir. - Why not? - Every time I give him his tray, he knocks it to the floor. And then he gets down, he starts muttering. Somebody pissed in my food. Somebody spit in my food. Somebody shit in my food. I don't know what he's thinking. And I don't care, Warden. - He's gotta be moved tomorrow. It's too big a job to do with him fully conscious. - I'll give him injections. - I think you of all people know he's not gonna let anybody near him with a needle. Just make sure he eats. Do whatever you have to do. Make sure he eats tonight. - It's not my job to feed psychos. - Yeah, it is, Joe. - Yes sir. Thanks. Thank you Warden, you have a great day. Sullivan. Come get your food. You're gonna eat tonight. Sullivan! Get over here, get your food. Sometimes a man just needs company. Okay I'll just waltz in there. Take the tray. Eat your food. You listen to me now. I'm not gonna get fired over some piece of shit child killer who won't eat his food. You'll eat your food now. Some people just like to fuck around. Some people don't like conforming. And some folks just need attention. There you go. Good boy. Yep. Yep, well. Special attention you're gonna get. [tense chaotic music] [groaning] [screaming] [alarm sounding] - It's Murphy, he's trapped in Sullivan's cell. - Sullivan! Sullivan! Put him back. - Just relax, ease up, ease up on the grip. - Richie! Let him go. - Back away from the gate. [snarling] - Let him go! Richie! - I saw it. I saw what you were doing. [cracking] - Richie! Richie! [gunshot firing] What did you do? - [Richie] Oh no, oh no. - Come on. You murderer! You did this. You did this! You get the fuck out of here! You get the fuck out! Get the bloody out! Lawyer fuck! Motherfucker! You're the fucker, man, you're the fucker! [whimsical music] - What's your name? - [Man] Well my friends call me Sammy. - Am I your friend? - Course you're my friend. I gave you that ice cream, didn't I? And for free? - Yup. - Yeah. Like I was saying. There's a lot more in here. Would you like to see? - I don't know. Mommy says never get in a stranger's car. - That's smart. That's really smart. I kind of have a problem though. I got a lot of ice cream in here and it's melting and I need a smart guy like you to help me eat it. I thought we were friends. - Okay, I'll help you. - [Guard] I should have just killed him. Had the goddamn shotgun, I should have just pulled the trigger. - You never had a clear shot. There wasn't anything you could do. - Murphy is dead. Sullivan fucking killed him. It didn't make a goddamn difference what we did or didn't do. - I knew he was gonna be a problem. I should have been more careful. I should have been more honest. I don't want it to be like this. - Enryk, what is it you're not telling us? - Do you believe in fate? - No sir. - 'Cause I moved to another state, you know. I went as far as I could in the opposite direction, even changed my name. - The fuck are you talking about, Enryk? - Yet here I am. And here we are. - Enryk, what the fuck is going on? - He's my brother. - Your brother? - Yeah. - The fucking psycho killed over 30 people. Half of them were children. - He's still my brother. - Who the fuck are you with? Jesus Christ. [light whimsical music] - Richie. Richard Sullivan! Get your ass out here! Richard? Where the fuck are you? You can't hide from me forever. It's your fault your father left! And your fault your brother stays out all night with those fucking sluts. But not you, Richard. You're with me forever. You're mine! Slayeth the evil that lives inside you. Where they're walking the devil walks too. Slayeth the evil that lives inside you. Where they're walking the devil walks too. [screaming] [gasping] - [Tommy] Richie, what have you done? - I'll never let you boys go. - [Tommy] Richie, help me. - Governor Adams please. [clanking] - [Guard] Pssss, Sullivan. Enryk might be having a hard time sending you off. But I sure as hell won't. [phone ringing] - Warden's office. Hello, Governor. - Hey, you got anything stronger than coffee to drink around here? - Hey, Enryk wants to see us. All of us. - What the hell's going on now? - Not sure but he just got off the phone with the Governor. Come on, let's go. - In light of recent events, the Governor does not wish me present during Richard Sullivan's execution. Mr. Simmons will be in charge. I expect you to obey him as you would me. - Thank you sir, appreciate you giving me the chance to prove myself to you. I won't let you or the Governor down. We all know what to do. No one is safe until he's dead. - Hey Richie. Hey Richie. - What? What do you want? - Well, I just came by to, say goodbye. - Ah, figures. Running away again. You were always the weak one. - I haven't been the perfect brother, right? Richie, look, you brought this on yourself. You see that? - Don't go trying to be the big brother now, Warden. 'Cause you're only good at two things. That's ignoring and running away. You ignored when she hit me. You ignored when she tortured me. You ignored when she pushed me down the fucking stairs. And when she was dead, you convinced your little problem to go join the army. And I know, oh I know you prayed that I died there. - I tried. I tried everything I could to protect you. But here you are. Here we are. - I was the only one, the only one with the balls to give that bitch what she deserved. - You weren't the only one that lived with her but I didn't end up killing people because of it. - Just because the government pays you to kill people, that doesn't mean you ain't a cold-blooded killer. I have been rotting. I have been rotting in this cell while you and all your little cronies torture and kill everyone. - You're so far gone. - Goddamit. They should strap you in a chair right next to me. [sniffling] - See, I pity you. All these years of loving you, for what? - Tommy. Look. Just because you change your name, that doesn't mean you're not my brother. - Oh, Richie. My brother died a long time ago. - Tom. Tommy! Get back here, you son of a bitch! Tommy! - Sullivan. Here's Father Alexander to read you your last rites. Just be careful. - Hello, Richard. I'm here to give you your last rites. Is there anything you'd like to say to me before I begin? Anything you'd like to ask or confess? - Have you ever killed anyone, Father? [sighing] - The Lord is here for you, my son, if you're willing. - Have you ever killed anyone? - No. - Then get the fuck out. - Father, you all right? - Buddy, don't even sit, let's go. ♪ Dead man walking - Come on, come on! Come on, Sullivan. Walk easy. [whimpering] [sobbing] - Come on, it's time to go. - Please. I'm not like the others. I'm not like Sammy. I'm not like Tudley. - It's time to go. - Over my dead body. - Come on Richie. Come on Richie, don't make me have these men-- - Please! - Richie! - Why is it happening to me? No! - Come on, let's go! - No! No! No! No! [guards mumbling] No! No! [screaming] No, no! No! - Come on, come on. The time for struggling is over. [razor humming] Sit down. [somber music] [dramatic music] - Sir! - That's what fact's I gotta-- - It's him, it's him! - Hands up, young man! On the deck, now. - My name is Richard Sullivan. - Get him out of here! - Agh! - Hey! Fuck! Alvarez! Smile. [shotgun blasting] Hey! Don't fucking think of it, put it down. Put it down and get on your fucking knees. - Just relax. - Take these shackles off. Slowly. Not that slow, come on! Get the cuffs off. Get the cuffs off, there you go. There you go. Stop shaking boy, you're making me nervous. Hear me. All right, smile. [shotgun blasting] [alarm sounding] [tense music] [shotgun blasting] [clacking] - Richie, Richie. - [Mother] Get the fuck out here! Take off. Take them off! Come here! Walk! Walk! - Richie. Don't worry Richie, I'm coming. - [Mother] Stop lying! Stop lying! [Richie screaming] Shh! - Stop, Richie, make it stop. - [Richie] Tommy, where are you? Help me. - I'm coming. - [Richie] Ow! Please stop. [slapping] - [Mother] I'll stop, [Richie screaming] Stop? How is that? [Richie screaming] - Don't. [Richie screaming] [whacking] - Stay still! Take it! Take it like a man! - [Richie] Don't do this to me, please. - Shut up! - [Richie] Tommy help me! - Don't, don't, stop! - [Richie] Tommy, where are you? Help me. You promised you won't let her hurt me. - Stop. - You were gonna put me down. Like a dog. - Richie, I'm your brother! Richie! Richie, don't. - You son of a bitch. You failed me. You failed to save me from what I am. You failed to save all those people I killed. And ultimately, you failed to save yourself. [somber music] - I'll tell them. I'll tell them the truth. I'll tell them. Richie, I'll tell them. [tense music] I'll tell them the truth. - It's too late, Tommy. We're going home. [gunshot firing] [electricity buzzing] - [Mother] I'll never let you boys go. [eerie whimsical music] [somber airy music] [tense high pitched music]
