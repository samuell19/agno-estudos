What? Enemy at the gate! Sound the alarm! Kunyi is back. Oh, no. Jiahao! Somehow I doubt you're all alone. Leave us now, Kunyi! There will be no bloodshed. Oh, no. What do you think? Should we leave? It doesn't matter what you think. Of course we're not leaving. I'm here for the Jade Blade. No, Jiahao. I'm not going to take my entire army of soldiers and leave. I'm sure all the heroes will drop out of the sky, just in time and do their... hero poses. But we outnumber you! The Jade Blade will be mine. Sanxingdui is a sacred land. You will not enter. I don't care about your city. I just want the Jade Blade. Get him! Be invincible! We're the Warriors of the Seven Kingdoms. We'll have victory! Oh, no! He only has two hands. Everyone, hold! There it is, the hero poses. Cool entrance, right? Kunyi, you can try again, but we will defeat you again! I'm ready to die in battle. Are you? It's tough waiting for an entrance, right? What you cannot avoid, welcome. So, welcome. All right, team. Together! Aesop, protect the gate. - You got it! - Zhu, Zuma, - hold the bridge. - Yes. Li, sharp shots taking them out, front to back. On it. I'm going up the middle. Let's do this! Kill them all. Attack together. Come on! Come on! No, thank you. Goin' up! One! Two! Three, four, five! - Li! Behind you! - Whoa. Take this! Strike! Beat it. Too easy. - I'm win-- - Back off! Time to see the full power of my mask! We're losing, my lord, like... really badly. I knew you fools would never beat them, which is why I brought this. - Uh-oh. - Oh, no! No. Destroy. Destroy them all. Trample them! All of them, all! I've always said, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. This is a good time for that dragon form of yours! Don't pressure me. Down you go! Whoa. Li, watch out! No! You're not getting past me. Take that. -Ah! -Jiahao! No! No! One down, four to go. No! Father! Oh, no, no, no. - Father! - I'm okay. Keep fighting. I've got him! Here's another shot! I got it! Coming at you! Li! You end here. Disappointing. This isn't over. You're right, this isn't over. - You coward! - Go home! The Jade Blade will be mine! Until next time... heroes. - No! - Did we stop him? Yes. He's gone. I think... ...I'll be going now, too. You have all become my family. Li, you must find the next bearer of the Golden Mask. This duty falls to you. The promise of Sanxingdui is a city of hope, is a beacon of peace. This must survive. Yes, Father. I promise. There must be another to take my place. No! I promise to find the great warrior who will take your place. Good morning. Let's see what joys today brings. I need breakfast, or lunch. What time is it? I wore this outfit yesterday, but I'm going to a different place today, so it doesn't matter. Ugh, terrible. You know, you need to catch a break when you're telling homeless jokes to yourself. Right, Charlie. I've got some sketchy stuff to do, to make it through another day. Let's do it! ♪ One that you want to listen to ♪ Oh! Score. I don't care if her kid has a cold, I don't care if her whole family has mad cowbell disease. You tell her to email me all the revised contracts by 4:59 this afternoon, or she can explain to her kid how it's his fault Mommy needs to start looking for a new-- Oh! Sorry. Excuse me. Watch where you're going, street rat! I'm so sorry. Okay, what was I yelling at you about? Ah, yes... A fake? Of course it is. I can't believe he's gone. I-- I loved him so much. Then don't stop loving him. He loves you. As long as you remember him... as long as you love him... he will not be gone. He will not be forgotten. But I-- I can't-- -You can. -I can't-- The remedy for dirt is soap and water. The remedy for death is living. Honor your father by following in his footsteps. How do I find a hero worthy enough to put on the mask of my father? The mask shows you the way. However, it will not find a replacement for your father, but the hero Sanxingdui needs. Whoa. Wow! Things will change. I mean, they have to. I can't keep having all bad luck. Whoa! Hey, Thurman, what's up... -...side down. -Uh... I don't get it. Bring him to me, Mr. Thurman. Charlie! What the hell's the matter with you? You don't write, You don't call-- I've been introverting. I mean, yeah, I've-- I've been-- been busy. Now, that's what I want to hear! Been a while, you must have quite a haul. Haul? Oh! Yeah, big haul. I mean, uh, I-- I-- a dime? -A worthless flip phone? -Yeah, but what's this junk? You holdin' out on me? I-- remember, Rizzo, being rich is having money. -Being wealthy is having time. -I'm disappointed! You're lettin' your Uncle Rizzo down, kid. You don't like me? -Well, that's a shame. -Eh-- I need a few minutes to recover from that tragedy. Oh, look, Charlie, we're all family here. Sorry, I'm allergic to family. Everybody needs family. When you needed me, I took care of you. I taught you the rules of the streets, so, now, you need to be taking better care of me, huh? My needs are sarcasm, caffeine, and getting-rich-quick schemes. Not sure if my schedule has enough time in it. Have Thurman take care of you. Hey. You're my top earner. Nobody picks a pocket like you do, Charlie! And, uh, besides, uh-- the way I see it, you still owe me about, um, uh... about how much do we calculate, Mr. Thurman? Uh... About, uh, 20,000 bucks for all the times I've bailed you out -over the years. -Hey! Uh, bad decisions make good stories. Besides, you only bailed me out to keep working for you. That's right! You see how smart he is? And he knows Rizzo don't make loans unless he's dead certain he'll get paid back. With interest! Uh-- About, uh, how much was that interest now, Mr. Thurman? Uh... It's another 30k, compounded daily. That puts you in deep to me. A whole 50 grand, kid. You cannot imagine the immensity of the care I do not give. Isn't it a beautiful day to quit? Look, Charlie, even a clever kid like you can't walk far on two broken legs. Now, you ain't goin' nowhere. Not ever. And the next time we talk, you'd better have a big score for your old Uncle Rizzo. I hope you were takin' notes, -Mr. Thurman! -Uh... Cause what you need to know for dead certain is that nobody, and I mean nobody, gets anything free from Rizzo. Ah. I'm gonna kill you for dead certain, Charlie. I'll get him! ♪ Let's go! ♪ ♪ Work from the bo, bo, bo, bo ♪ ♪ Out, out with the ♪ ♪ Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep ♪ Ooh! Uh-oh. That's the little moocher who stole my watch. Hands on your head, kid! Bye-bye! Huh? Hmm. I will chase you to the ends of the planet! Slow down! What-- Get thee back here, you ruffian! Slow down, kid! Come on! Huh? -Hands on your head! -Nuh-uh! Get back here at once! You have my watch, you delinquent! How? Not some petty criminal. It's not possible. Hands on your head, kid! What? Uh-oh. - Huh? - So, little thief. Would you like me to get you out of here? Where'd you come from? I mean-- uh, yes. Yes. Get me out of here. - Come on. - How are we gonna-- They will catch us soon. No, no. No abracadabra! Hey! Get back here. Uh... And the next time, Charlie, you're dead. He will surely save Sanxingdui... - Sanxingdui... - He's not ready. - Always. - Not some petty criminal. I'm sure he's gonna be just great. Ew! Uh, okay? What's happening? You sure don't look like a hero, mister. You don't look like you've ever skipped a meal. Your clothes look really weird. Like a pile of dirty laundry. Sure, shirts get dirty. -Huh? -Underwear gets dirty. Pants? No, pants never get dirty. You can wear them forever. And you smell like feet. Oh. That's my cologne. It's called "I Struggle." Welcome to Sanxingdui, the city of hope. This place reminds me of the Land of Oz. For real, what's happening? This is a key to a mystic portal. -Oh. -When you step through, you travel to the other side of the world, 4,000 years into your past. -Uh, okay. -Follow me. - See you later, Charlie! - Bye-bye. All the way the top of that thing? King Yufu! Li, my dear girl! You're back! You're back! I trust your mission was a success. -Did you find our hero? -Uh... Is he brave and noble? I'm sure he's courageous and strong. He will surely help save Sanxingdui from certain doom. Not exactly. I'm exhausted. I mean, yesterday was leg day. Normally, I would crush all those stairs! Rocky style, right? Hey, go get the others. - On it! - Who's this sketchy beardo? I have pogonophobia. It's the fear of beards. He is our most revered King Yufu. Creator of the Tree of Life and the mystic portals. Here, you will show the proper respect. You think I'm disrespectful? You should hear what I don't say. It's quite all right, my boy. Quite all right. So, the mask chose you. Hmm. Such interesting attire. Huh. Anyways, I'm sure all this is a lot to take in. It is a lot to take in. My mom used to say, "We were only given problems that we could handle." Apparently, she thought I was Superman. Well, you see, uh... -Charlie. -Very good! Yes, Charlie. You see, you above all others have been selected... -Not by me. -...by the magic of the mask, to join a legendary team of heroes, committed to defending the city of Sanxingdui, its good people, and our precious and most powerful Tree of Life. This is that portal key leaf thing? Yes, that leaf thing is from the Tree of Life, that can open portals to any place and any time. The mask chose you to defend the Tree of Life, but of course, you must choose to accept the offer, Charlie. Hmm-- uh, does this job have benefits? - Ugh. - Uh, benefits? Oh, like, uh, paid holidays, 401K... - Paid holi-- - Health and dental. - Seriously? - A 4-0? Bonus structure, company car? -Car? -Uh, maybe it'd be like a company chariot! You know, benefits? Ah, I'm afraid the benefits are more spiritual. Non-profit organization. Got it. Note to self, avoid the Kool-Aid. Let us introduce you to your teammates, the most noble heroes of the golden mask! First up, is the amazing Zhu, whose mask gives him the power to transform into all 12 animals of the Zodiac! Whoa! Easy, Tigerkins. Don't eat me, okay? Eat you? Um, well, sh-- should I? I mean, I am a tiger, but then, uh... I'm also a vegetarian! The incredible Zuma, a warrior from the Mayan Kingdom! His mask gives him the ability to control a pok-a-tok ball with only his mind. Ah, you are no warrior, kid. First time today I would agree with someone. The big, and big-hearted, Aesop! From the Lost City of Atlantis. Big hug now, Charlie. You're kind of a cute little guy, now, aren't you? I think we're gonna be buddies! Oh, easy, big blue. Don't you have a group to join? Come on. Personal space, please. I'm so happy the mask chose you. And last, but not least, the most devoted of the heroes, your leader, and Charlie's coach. - Uh, coach? - Yes. The unstoppable Li! - Aw, man, really? - Whose mask makes her the most dangerous archer in the world! Great! Lesson number one, run! Whoa! No. Wonderful! Wonderful! Now, do you understand? Charlie, you see, the danger to our beloved city has never been greater. The evil warlord Kunyi has pledged to destroy us. By using the Tree of Life, he can travel through space and time. If he reaches the Tree of Life, he would acquire the Jade Blade. Ooh, sounds expensive. The Jade Blade is the most powerful weapon. It is what Kunyi most desires, and only the five heroes... ...well, now there are only four. Oh, he, uh... -he quit? -No. My father died fighting Kunyi. - Ew. - Charlie. Without you to complete the team, we are all of us doomed. Not just every man, woman, and precious child in Sanxingdui, but in all the universe. So, I trust we can count on you? Wait! Perhaps I didn't explain it well enough. Oh, no, you've explained it just fine. King Exposition. But I'm just gonna take a pass. But-- but did I mention the evil warlord part? I told you. That one is no hero. The mask must have made a mistake. Then you'll have to train Charlie to control his mask. Before all of us are lost. - Thanks! - Oh. What? Hey! What? Wha-- If your mind is weak, all easy things will become difficult. You can't just walk away. You can't walk back home. -Yeah, right. -You need a portal key. Right, I need a leaf thingy. -And we need you, Charlie! -Uh, uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Personal space. Not staying here and I have no home to go back to. So, I'm looking for a fortune. Or at least food. But you have to come back with us. - I do not! - And join our team. - No! - You are coming back. No, thanks, I've never cared much about being a team player. I'm more of an every man for himself-- Whoa! You have been given a responsibility. Why don't you want to help? 'Cause I want to live, and it sounds like you guys are planning on dying. Real soon. You weak coward! Let's get him! Gold cannot be pure, and people cannot be perfect. Why would I want to get myself killed wearing some gold-painted Halloween mask? Painted? Oh, our masks aren't painted. They're real gold, all right. Solid gold. The fortune pales compared to their value. Right, 'cause who'd ever care about an untold fortune? Of gold? I do! I mean-- I mean-- - I mean I will. - Hmm. I will join your noble cause to defend the people of Sanxingdui, and be good and all that other important stuff. You will? Wonderful, wonderful! I will. I've had a-- what do you call it, uh... -Epiphany. -Yes! An epiphany. Uh, this is my, uh... - Destiny. - What? -Exactly. -Wonderful! Wonderful! Charlie, you may have the others fooled, but don't think for a second I don't know what kind of person you really are. Maybe I'm a little shifty, but it makes ordinary conversations much more interesting. The kind with no honor. Yeah, I am shifty. And I got your key. I can't wait for Charlie to meet my mom! Yes, I can only imagine what she's gonna say. Oh, he's too skinny! Practically nothin' to him! Nope, definitely way too skinny to be a hero! - Not a hero. - When was the last time you ate? Charlie, right? -Actually, I am really-- -Here, eat some spicy tofu! It'll put meat on your bones and warm up your qi. What do you suppose he's doing? I think maybe he's looking for something. Looks like he's got a bad tummy. I think he's gonna be sick. I know what he wants. - More spicy tofu. - Water. Maybe he's looking for a new-- Water, water, water! Somehow, I don't think that was it. That one's gonna need a lot of work. Charlie? Here, this is your spot. It's right next to me! Great, right? Oh, yeah. Great. I'm so happy the mask chose you. Your mask wouldn't have chosen you if you didn't have the heart for it. - Easy! - You just have to open up. Then your mask will work. He's doin' the best he can! Five more minutes! Hmm. - Masks. - Here you go. If your mind is strong, all difficult things will become easy. - Zuma. - All right. Yours, too, Charlie. We keep them locked away at night for safekeeping. - Hmm. - Come on. And the masks are safe there? -Your concern is noted. -It'll be okay, Charlie. It's a magic chest with a magic lock. -Of course it is. -Get some sleep. Training starts first thing tomorrow. So, Aesop, what do you know about Kunyi? Well, that's a long story. -Many years ago-- -No, no, stop, stop, stop. Can you make this, uh, the quick version? Like, the movie trailer version? You know, that starts like, "In a world..." and then some stuff blows up, and then it goes "But now..." and a lot more stuff blows up, and now it's, like, in the credits, you know. Okay, uh... In a world where our king dreamed of reaching out to other realms, and inviting all their greatest artists, thinkers and philosophers to join us, and make Sanxingdui a crossroads of peace and prosperity. He created the magic portals. But now, those very portals have allowed evil conqueror, Kunyi, into our world, where he plans to plunder and destroy everything he touches, which is why we need you to help us stop him! Kaboom! How'd I do? Shockingly well, actually. I mean, it could have used a little more explosions, but-- Hey, I'm really glad you decided to stay. Yeah? Well, I'm glad you're glad. We're all glad. Now gladly let me sleep. Gold, for me? More gold for me? Oh, I couldn't possibly-- okay. I don't know how can I carry all of it. Oh, you made a helicopter of gold so I can carry it? Ah, that's so nice of you. Hey! Get up. Time to train. Oh, man. Really? It will be dawn soon. We start now. Yes, sir. Drill sergeant, sir. What is a "drill sergeant"? It's an action movie cliché. Cliché? Yeah, like those training montages that begin with... No, that is definitely not what we're doing. Um, what exactly are we doing again? We are meditating on the purpose of our mission, and on the code that requires us to sacrifice ourselves, if necessary, to protect the people of Sanxingdui. Um, I thought I was supposed to be learning golden mask stuff. You know, magic punching, laser eyes, super-powered socks. Like, something like that. Yes. You'll need to discover the power of your mask, but first, you need to understand why you're being given that power. You do understand that, right? What's really at stake here. Let me guess. The fate of the entire world. I'm only joking. Geez, you never laugh, do you? Life is hard. I don't see the humor in that. You're a therapist's dream client. You know that, right? - Come on! - What? What's happening? Your training just became the on-the-job kind. Only together will they be able to beat Kunyi. Aoyin! Show no mercy. Destroy the city! Back it up! Go! This will be fun. Over here! Quick. Did you really think I would stop? Even your masks can't stop Aoyin. She'll rip open your gates. If you stand in her way, you will die. She's unstoppable. Over there. I see Li and Charlie! -Operation start! Attack! -Come on! The first blow is half the battle. Attack! - I've got you! - Don't let go of me! -Stay here. -And do what? Try to make your mask work. How? Zhu! Let's go! Hop on! Come on! Attack. Faster! Faster! Quick, hurry! We have to stop it. Focus. Go, attack. Whoa! Zhu, no! Go back. - Nope, I don't-- - Attack it. Nope, nope, nope. Not gonna do it. So close. So close. Keep ramming. Bring the gate down. Bring the entire wall down. Destroy Sanxingdui. Hmm. Oh, well, uh-- Ow. Huh? Hm. - Oh. - Uh, sorry. Excuse me. Sorry, sorry, so sorry. King Yufu! King Yufu! Kunyi is back! What do we do? What do we do? Disappointing. Let's go! Aoyin. He's trying to break down the gate. Together! Converge! I shall slay the beast! We must trust in our heroes. Aoyin is said to be unstoppable. We attack together. Now! Converge as one on the monster. - Oh, no! - Watch out! The city. Now it's my turn. - No! No! - Watch out! Hey, hey, hey, hey! - What? - Get back! - What? - That's it! - Uh... - Right here. Come and get it. How's this? - What's he doing? - I don't know. Let's do it. No, you don't stand a chance! - Run! - Nuh-uh! Do you have a better plan? Hey! Ferdinand, over here! You like red? - Four! - Insolent fool. -Three! -Use your mask, Charlie! Two! One. Come on, come on. Yes! The end. Watch out! Ah! No. Who's the hero now? I am. Yeah, meaningless. Charlie, get the statue! Before Kunyi. -Oh, no! -Imbecile. - I can't-- - Come on, Charlie. Ow! Whoa. How irritating. I'll end you quickly. Back off. - You again. - You're beaten, Kunyi. Just walk away. The Tree of Life will grant me the Jade Blade, and I will rule all the realms across eternity! Let's go! -That was amazing, Charlie! -Thanks. That was a very difficult fight. I used my power. It was like I could just pull it out his hands with my thoughts. I should have known your power would involve taking things from people. I hope you get better at it. You don't have any idea what you're doing out there. Do you, mister? Hey, how about some constructive criticism? -Yeah! -Yeah. - You're not good at anything. - Don't sugarcoat it. You really stink. Hey, thanks for the emotional support, kids. I hope all of you fall in the well soon. -Goodbye! -Bye! Bye! Now, I want everyone to eat up! You're all lookin' too skinny. - Yes, ma'am! - Oh, boy. - Score! - Charlie? -What the hel-- lo there, Helen! -Call me Mom. Now, why don't you come downstairs now and join the rest of us for dinner? That's okay, I'll just take mine up here. -Kind of used to eating alone. -Alone? Well, now why would anyone want to eat alone, when they can eat with a family? I'm allergic to family. You see, Helen, for me, the word "family" is a mom and dad. Maybe even a sibling. Of which I have none. Where I come from, being a part of a family means someone just wants something from you. I have no family, and I don't really want any. Ah, Charlie. You know, you can tell yourself that story if you want. I mean, if it helps to keep some space between you and something you don't want to feel. But you're pushing people who actually care about you away! Honey, you are gonna have to love again, or you will never know all the wonderful things you're missing out on. -Oh, yeah? Like what? -More spicy tofu! - It'll be okay, Charlie. - There. All right. All right. I'm here, and I'm eating your hot lava. Happy now? So, uh, Zhu, how many animals can you turn into again? Oh! Well, uh, 11. -Ah, 12. -11. 12 signs of the zodiac! Zhu has never tried to achieve his dragon form. -He's afraid of heights. -I am not! - I am just-- - Yes, you really are. Just working my way up to it. That's all. I'll-- I'll try one day. "Do or do not. There is no try." That's funny, Charlie! Zhu, do. It is also said, "Make me." It is also said, "Stupid Zhu better shut up." Hey! You two get those clothes dirty, you are washing them yourselves. - Zhu! Enough. - Yes, ma'am. So, like, that giant ox thing today. That was ridiculous, right? I bet you've never seen anything like that before. -Oh, no. Usually it's worse. -Uh... Fools. That'll keep those heroes busy. -What are these guys? -Mud monsters. They're-- they're stupid, but resilient. Charlie, hit it like this. The best fighter is never angry. Nope, nope, nope, nope. I got this little piggy. - Zhu! - Oh, no! What the... Well, that's not right. Watch out! Huh. We are here to protect Sanxingdui. Get ready for battle! Watch the trees! Soon, the Jade Blade will be mine! Awaken, my monster. Kill them all. Rise. No! Children! Go find the heroes. They were just outside the walls. - We're on it! - Run! King Yufu, you must remain inside. We are here to protect you. I swear to defend Sanxingdui with my last dying-- Enough! Go and protect our citizens! Get them to safety, go! I'm back, baby! Incredible! We saved the city. - Well done! - What the-- The-- the city. It must be Kunyi. - Come on. - Let's do this! - Let's go! - Whoa! While the heroes are distracted, let's fly to the Tree of Life! Kunyi's here, and he's headed for the temple! We need to tell the heroes! Hmm. Stop right there, Kunyi! Watch out! -Stop! -What have we here? Let go of her! We need a plan. Otherwise, Hole Face will swallow up the whole city. No, look out! I'm putting you down. You're not gettin' past me! Time for the thunder. Heroes! Heroes! -Kunyi is here! -Yeah! He was headed for the temple! - We need to hurry! - Charlie. You, Zuma and Aesop will have to take care - of Hole Face. - Okay. Zhu and I will protect the tree from Kunyi. -Just the three of us? -Yes. We have to. The mask, it realized you have the power to wield it. It's time you realized it, too. Okay. Let's do it. Let's do this! Well, well, well. The one blocking my path to the Tree of Life, standing between me and the all-powerful Jade Blade is an old woman? An old, blue woman? That's right! And this old, blue woman won't budge a single inch! Is that so? -Sorry, what's your name? -Helen. -Yungki, get me Helen. -No! Get off! What did you think was going to happen, Helen? Did you think you were going to stop me? - With a spoon? - It's a ladle. And no, I don't think I can stop you! That wasn't part of my plan! -Let go of me! -Do you know what was my plan? Oh, I'll tell you my plan. Yeah. My plan was to slow you down! Back off, Kunyi. Get away from her! Ah, think you're so smart? -Ha! -Yungki, grab her. Let's go. Faster, Zhu. Stop! Get back here! -Kunyi will-- Helen! - No! No! - Helen! Helen, was it? Let's see if the heroes will leave their castle. - No! - This time they'll come to me. Li, unless you want Helen's head on my fireplace as a round, blue trophy, you're coming to me. I'll be waiting for all of you in my obsidian tower. You'd better hurry. - Quick, let's get out of here. - Watch out! Run! Help! Its mouth is grinding everything like a garbage disposal. What is a garbage disposal? It's a machine that grinds anything into little bits. Except spoons. Hey! That's it. Metal. Um, uh, the statue! We can use it against Hole Face. - What? How? - What? You lift up this big metal statue, and you toss it right into Hole Face's mouth. He won't be able to grind it apart, then he won't be able to spit out the junk - he swallowed up. - Ah, leave it to me. Hey! Hole Face! - You suck. - Have an appetizer! I'm slipping! Aesop! Hold on. I'm getting sucked away! - I've got you. - I can do this. No! No! Aesop! No! Come on, I can do this. - No! - Come on, Charlie. Oh, no! Oh, my God, we did it! - Well done. - We did it! - We saved the city. - Hey. You're okay? Yeah, thanks to Charlie! Now that was a team effort. Aesop, Kunyi was here. Helen stood between him and the temple. Aesop, Kunyi has your mother. Oh, no! Mom! I'm coming for you. -All right, then. -Come on! Zhu, no! Aesop, wait! - Come on! - Aesop, we'll get her back. Now, does anybody know where Kunyi lives? He will have taken her to the Obsidian Tower. But to get there, you must travel across Sanxingdui, to the Fearful Mountains, and it is in the Fearful Mountains there are hungry ghosts. Pitiful creatures who haunt the land. Always feeding and yet always hungry. They devour everything in their way. And they cannot be killed. They feed on power, so you cannot use your masks. No way! That has gotta be the dumbest thing I've ever heard. If you use your masks, they will sense the power. Hungry ghosts are unstoppable. They would consume the power of the masks, and finally, you. I am sorry, but your masks cannot beat the hungry ghosts, so you cannot use them. Do you all understand? All of you must follow this path together, - or none of you will survive. - All right. So, I have no choice. Hmm. Are you gonna get yourself killed, mister? Be safe. We want you to come back. So don't stink it up! Children, so adorable. I'll try not to. Bye-bye. Bye-bye! -Bye! -Bye, Charlie. We'll miss you! The more you sweat in peacetime, the less you bleed during war. Ah! Oh, um, sorry. Just can't get comfortable. Whoa! Well, if you can't get comfortable pulling us all the way on the cart, you could get us there a lot quicker, you know. As a dragon! Patience is power. We could fly to Kunyi's tower so easily. -Become the dragon of power! -No, no, nope! Nope! Okay. Let's go. -Mom's favorite. Spicy-- -Tofu? No. Thanks, I'll just eat the rice. That's, uh, pretty-- pretty good, Aesop. Almost as good as your mom's. Sure, laugh at the amateur. I guess you're all just born chopstick experts, just like you're all born heroes. Oh, no. None of us were born heroes. I was just a humble shopkeeper. I was a Little League pok-a-tok coach. With an unbeaten record. My father was a fisherman. Simple, but honorable. He taught me how to fish and how to fight. I was a woodworker. I love carving. It's my passion. Well, then, how did you all get picked to be superheroes? I guess I just assumed. -Just like you do, Charlie. -Is that me? It's who you can become. Thanks, I'll treasure mini-Charlie forever. What's that, Charlie? Soon as the, uh, battery runs out, apparently nothing. -Can't sleep? -Hi, Zhu. Have you tried counting chickens? - Is that what you do? - When I'm a tiger. Do you dream of tigers when you're a rooster? No, but thanks a lot for putting that in my mind. - Oh, uh, hey, where did Li go? - I don't know. Do not be afraid of moving slowly. Be afraid of standing still. Father, I'm so ashamed. I doubted you. Li, are you okay? Yes. I'm making an offering to my ancestors. My father, he's the one who sent me to find you. So, this is all his fault? Sorry. Sometimes, when I joke, I'm-- I've noticed. Sit. Let me introduce you. -Uh, introduce? -His spirit is here. Freaky, but I'll roll with it. All I ever wanted to do was duty to make him proud. But I didn't trust in his wisdom, because I was so sure the mask had made the wrong choice. You're a sneak and a thief. And then you've shown yourself to be a hero, which is just so-- -Crazy? -Yes. Your unexpected heroism makes my brain very crazy. Well, actually, the mask did most of the work. You know I don't really care for you that much, right? Uh-oh. Is that a non-strategic smile I just saw? It might have been a smirk. What is that little box -you seem to care so much about? -This? Oh, this is just a picture of my parents. My ancestors. Oh, you all look so happy. -What happened? -Do you know what a car is? Well, there was an accident. They saved me, but they didn't make it. I've always been so mad about it. I've had lots of families, from foster parents to mobsters. That's why I decided I'd be better off on my own. And do you still think that now? I don't really know. My heart swings back and forth between the need for family and the urge to run. -So, I'm pretty-- -Crazy? Yeah. Yeah, crazy. But I was thinking, maybe I could grow to like this craziness. Then there is hope for you yet, Charlie. Maybe we both still have a chance - to make our ancestors proud. - Yeah. Maybe. Stop. Uh, what's going on? These are the Fearful Mountains. Just as King Yufu said, we can't use our masks. The hungry ghosts would consume our energy. And us. Masks. I don't like this. Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated. I think this is a mistake to hide. -I'd rather fight! -Not this time, Zuma. The hungry ghosts are unstoppable. They are cursed to walk the Fearful Mountains forever. Always consuming. Always hungry. No problem. I got it. No! Kunyi has taken their villages, their farms. He's stealing from them! Please, please, could you not take away all of our food? My family depends on this food to get us through the winter. Please! We will starve. Well, that's not right. Aesop, keep your voice down. Li, we need our masks. No, we cannot use our masks, it would alert the hungry ghosts. We have a mission, we need to get to the Sea of Clouds. -Quickly. -But we're heroes. I hate to admit it, but I agree with Zuma. - We have to do something. - Stay on the mission! We cannot use our masks. Then we'll have to do something without them! -Let's go! -You stay with the cart. But-- Please, you can't leave us with nothing! We'll be victorious! We'll spare no one. Ow! Looks like you don't know when to quit. Come! You could have asked them to share! Die, heroes! Why, you! Take this! Get back here! Ah! Uh. Uh-oh. Oh, no! Hold on Zuma, I got it. Ah! Huh? Ah! You're not that strong! -Feel my blade! -Whoa! Really, please. Stand still so I can hit you. Okay, maybe you are that strong. Ah! No! You have saved my family. Thank you. The heroes truly are the greatest in the land! -Thank you. -Thank you. -Thank you, heroes. -Thank you, hero. That was so cool. So, so, so stupid. Gah! Not again. I had the gold in my hand-- whoa! Charlie, I am so proud of you. He who is sure of his own victory will not start a war. You saved Li's life! -Well done. -Charlie! That was so stupid. You were told you can't use your mask. Why? Why did you use it? And why do you have all five masks? Charlie, why do you have all the masks? Run! Everyone run! I'll get the masks! I got them! Go! Run! They're gaining! Run! Run! They're quick. I don't know if I can make it. I'm not exactly a long-distance runner. Aesop! They are gaining! Let go of the cart! The wheel! You ghosties hungry? Eat this! Need to protect masks. Hurry! Hurry! Run! The Sea of Clouds is ahead. I must protect the masks! -No! Let go of him! -Aesop! No! No! The masks! Yes, let's go. Dawn is coming soon. We must hurry. -Why, what happens at dawn? -The sun burns the clouds away. And we all fall to our deaths. I'll be unstoppable. -Look out for the holes! -In the clouds? Also, thunderheads. You should never, ever row into a storm. That just seems like common sense. - Hole! - Oh, no. Hard to port! Woo! Just a small one. We are really lucky that wasn't-- Bigger hole! Hard to starboard! Row! Row! Uh, we want to avoid the holes. Yeah, yeah. I-- I get it. Holes bad. We need a bigger boat. - Mom? - Helen! Mom! Stop! Aesop, this is a trap. Dude, seriously? -Charlie? -I'm here to save you. Mom. Oh, Mom, I was so worried. Heroes, this is a trap! That seems to be the consensus. Oh, Charlie, my boy, it looks like you're not allergic to family anymore. Heroes! Hello! Here to assault my fortress and save the old lady? Without your masks, that's very brave. And very stupid. Was this your idea, Li? Yes, I'm quite sure it was yours. So predictable. I'm not surprised you tried to honor your dead father's mission. Emphasis on the dead part. But do you know what does surprise me? That none of your merry band seem to know you have a traitor in your midst. What do you mean, "traitor?" Oh, why hear it from me when you can ask him yourself? Isn't that right, Charlie? What? No. Oh, really? Tell us honestly. Which would you rather do? Save the old lady, or get your hands on all that shiny gold again? I bet you don't even know yourself. Okay! Yes. I tripped and fell into some greed. I brushed it off, though. I did want the masks, at first, but-- So, back at the farm, to get your mask, you-- you must have broken into the chest -and-- -That's not fair! Your plan was to steal all the masks? -The plan changed. -No, you'll never change. Why was I so stupid? Excuse me, but entertained as I am by all this maudlin family drama, I think it's time we skipped to the next act, - and start having some... - Hey! ...real fun. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wei the Unbeaten is never outnumbered, boy! Ah, Charlie. Charlie, stop. -Charlie. -Charlie? - Oh, no! - Sorry, Li. Charlie? No! I knew you'd come back -to this old dump. -What? No! Your folks owned, uh, the repair store out front, before they kicked, right? Well, unless you got something worth about, uh, 50K on you, dreams aren't the only things gonna be dyin' in this place. A distinct disappointment, is it not, Mr. Thurman? No, Thurman! No, no, no, no, no! What you got for me? Well, kid, you ain't sneakin' away this time. In a world where a little boy lost everything he loved, and grew up all alone, he found himself forced to become a thief just to survive! Is the circus in town? But now, that same boy has been offered a new purpose, a new family, and a big, new, blue friend, who saw him being followed here by some creeps, and who, as it happens, is uniquely qualified to bring the kaboom! -How'd I do? -Charlie laughs] Everybody loses people they love, Charlie. No one can promise you they'll always be there, but I can promise that I'll always try. You're a hero, Charlie. You just have to decide if you're ready to be part of a family again. A family that needs you right now. Let's go! Wei the Ghost Walker will fan these flames until they're as hot as the sun, melting down the heroes! And their magical masks! Why didn't I see this coming? That selfish little con man was plotting to steal from us the whole time. And then he just-- just abandoned us. What do we do now? I-- I still feel like you want me to search for hope, but I don't know where to look for it. Try opening your eyes. - Charlie! - You? - Charlie? - You're a sneak and a thief! All true. But those skills can come in pretty handy right now. -Right? -Kunyi has already left. To destroy Sanxingdui! Well, give me a few more seconds, and then we'll all kick some villain butt together. Why in the world should we trust you again? Because as much as I hate to admit it, hanging out with you four weirdos has made me see what I can become. And what's that? The fifth weirdo. What are you doing with that, Charlie? Hi, fellas! I've got you! Come on! Come on! Come on! Yeah! Let's do this! Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Come on! Whoa! - Ow! - Take this! Whoa. Whoa. Charlie! Mask! Ah! Kaboom! Ha! - Let's go! - Let's go! Whew. Come on. -We must keep moving. -At least we've got the masks. -Let's go! -Wait. We're still gonna be too late. Kunyi had too big of a head start. We'll never catch up to him before he reaches Sanxingdui and the Jade Blade. We could be there in minutes. This will be the end of Sanxingdui. No. Uh, no. How many times do I have to say this? -No! -Of course you can! It's the only way you'll be able -to catch up in time! -Uh, I'm too scared. I won't be able to stay in dragon form, and then I'll fall. Okay, so-- so basically, you're saying you're afraid of failing, so you're afraid of trying, because if you never try, you can never fail, but if you never try, you always fail? Exactly. Yes. What-- I-- I think so. Wait, what-- what was that last part? Zhu, stop thinking about everything you have to lose by failing. Start thinking about everything you have to gain by trying. If I can do it, anybody can. Do you really believe I can do it? We all believe in you. Even Li. And she hates everyone. Woohoo! I'm flying! I'm finally flying! This is the best feeling in the world! - Oh, no! - Run! Go away, you stinker! Oh, no! Watch out! Back off! I'm warning you! You aren't dead, mister! Well, the day's still young. Why didn't I try this earlier? Woohoo! Large and in charge! Watch out! - The king. - Oh, no! It is mine. The Jade Blade is mine. I won. The crossroads of hope you've created is quite impressive. Misapplied, but impressive. You have only one path. This is destiny. Why must you take this dishonorable path? Honor is for forgetful fools and naive children. No! Kunyi! We were just thinking about you. - It's over, Kunyi. - Step away from the portal! You're too late. It's mine. -No one can stand against me! -You haven't won yet! Are you serious? My arm! My body! I feel... great! -I am... -This'll hurt! ...invincible! Impossible. You are but a grain of rice on my plate. - Li! - No, no, no! No! - No! - Now you're asking for it! Complete domination. Kunyi, how can anyone be so noisy outside, - yet inside so empty? - Oh, be quiet. No! Enough, Kunyi! From all of us, say goodbye, Kunyi! Be struck down, Atlantean! Get back! Stop! Don't you get it? I have the sacred Jade Blade. I control power greater than any force on Earth! -You shall all bow before me. -Never. For as long as I'm a hero, I will fight for-- A hero? Don't make me laugh. Your masks are powerless against me. Gather up the masks, or I cut you all down. Get the masks! Do it! One by one, witness your hopes... -No! -...disappear. With the Jade Blade at my command, no one can stop me. And your masks will be hung as trophies to prove it. -Our masks! -Charlie, no! The heroes are powerless now. - No. What? - Where's the fifth mask? Your friends were a distraction? That's right, now, for my minute-long monologue. I've got him. - We've got this! - Let go of me! Enough, Kunyi! Forget about all the havoc you've wreaked on Sanxingdui. Out of all the things you've done, the biggest mistake you've made was hurting my... family. This power-- this power will banish the chaos once and for all. Stop! Please. Forgive me. Really? No! Stop. I don't wanna. Be gone! Wonder where I'll be. - Charlie. - Buddy! - Charlie. - King Yufu? I'm okay. Don't you kids worry. I'm alive and well. King Yufu. Here, the Jade Blade. All of you, please, accept my greatest apologies, and deepest gratitude. All this just for us? I'm so proud of you, Charlie. - Hey, Charlie! - You did it Charlie! You're a real hero, Charlie. Heroes of the golden masks, if not for your bravery, Sanxingdui would have been destroyed. Zhu, you are finally the great dragon I always knew you were. Opportunities don't just happen. You create them. Wonderful! Wonderful. Zuma, your warrior's spirit led the charge. I didn't break a sweat! So brave and noble. Li, my dear girl, your father looks upon you, very proud. And Charlie, I am so proud of you and your journey. Well, I didn't expect this. Thanks. Aesop, you have once again shown you are an incredible son. Yeah! Yeah, large and in charge. All of you stand before all of us, the most noble heroes. I'm proud of you, Charlie. -Thanks, Aesop. -Seriously. Well done, Charlie. Jiahao is proud of you too, Li. Charlie. You are a warrior. Might not be gold, but, uh, I did get my treasure. For now, the magic and the mission of Sanxingdui will flourish, thanks to the heroes of the golden mask!
