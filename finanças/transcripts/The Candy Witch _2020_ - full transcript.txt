Uh-huh. All right, sweetie. Yeah, have a good night. See ya tomorrow. Willie? Willie. Oh, my god! Who in God's name's messing with me? God, work. Stupid. No. We can hear her. At night, we can hear her upstairs. Far bedroom to the right. She used to spend her time in there, sewing. She used to say it helped keep her mentally alive. I understand that, in these times, sometimes all you wanna do is forget. And with your fiancé not being able to pass, it must really put a weight on you. I just wanna move on with my life. I'll help you. May I go upstairs? Please. Are you sure you don't want me filming? I'll be fine. I can get it. Stay downstairs and look after Ben. Sure. We're about to enter the affected space. Just to recap for you guys, Carla Johnson died in 2013. And ever since her death, her fiancé, Ben, has felt her presence through this room. Carla Johnson. If you are here, please, come and be present. Your fiancé is trying to move on with his life. It's not that you'll be forgotten, 'cause you won't. Is that a sign? I'm here to help you both move on. To let go. Jesus Christ. You ruined my shot. Kat, I told you to wait downstairs. Reece, I think I caught her. I wanted to release her. I've been calling you for half an hour. You didn't hear me? Kat. I said if my hearing went again, I'd say, okay? It's not worth it if you're having side-effects, Reece. What if one day your hearing doesn't come back? I can't do this without you, we're a team. I just wanna help people, before... I get it. I just worry about you is all, okay? Thank you. I appreciate it, I really do. Don't shut me out. I'm sorry, for any... I understand, your gift. I see what it does for people. And so do our followers. 2,000 likes on the Carla Johnson case already. We are a team. There are also a few fans who wanted to do this. Hello. I'm sorry it's late, I just, didn't know what else to do. Who is this? Sorry. Ruth O'Neil. I found you online. You speak to the dead. I can speak to those that have trouble passing, yes. Something is inside my house, but I'm not sure if it's a spirit, or something else. Okay, may I ask what's been happening? I can, I can hear her. I see her, in my house. The Candywitch. And you can physically see her in your house? I need help, I didn't know who else to call. You see, I feel like a prisoner in my own home. Do you understand? I understand too well what you mean. I just want it to stop. I just want peace in my life once more. I can't... I can't live a normal life. Please. Please, say you can help me. The Candywitch? That's her picture. Papers want you to believe she's dead and gone. Don't trust them. You see her, you make sure you hide your kids. She uses candy canes, people! Candy canes! Why does it matter who believes in your gift? What do you mean? Well, the people who knew your father, they knew his gift. What does it matter what they say online? Reece, you gotta stop filling your head with this stuff. Okay? I just hate seeing it online. He had a gift and he... And that gift killed him. And he wouldn't want it to do the same to you. Stop doing this to yourself. Someone called. At this time? An old lady, her name's Ruth. Says she feels like a prisoner in her own home. Struggling to move on with her life. Right? Says the Candywitch haunts her. The Candywitch? Sounds fun? A child murderer. What time do we leave? Tina? Tina? Tina? Tina, honey. It's time to go inside. Sure you wanna do this? Yeah, I'm sure. You? Absolutely. You ready for your close-up? Let's get going. Welcome to the mad house. Come on in, Ruth's been expecting you. You're early. Hi, Ruth? Lovely to meet you and thank you for coming. You have brought a guest? This is my girlfriend, Kat. She's gonna be documenting this experience. Well, if that's what's required, sure. We have a bedroom, but it's a small double. Oh, no worries, we'll make it work. - Hi, I'm Kat, nice to meet you. - You too, darling. Okay, let me show you in the house, and introduce you to the family. Come on in. - You have a beautiful house. - Thank you. I didn't realize you had a family. I thought you lived alone. No. Last week, my family were away on travels, and I was on my own. That's when the incidents heightened, when I was alone. Come meet my husband. Hi. - Hi. - You must be Reece. I heard a lot about you. And thank you for coming on such short notice. I'm Willie, Ruth's long sufferin'. Of course, pleasure to meet you, Willie. Tom? Tom, come in here. Tom's our son, he's just in from college. - This is Reece. - Nice to meet you. I've seen some of you guys' stuff online, it's cool. Thanks. Is there anyone else that lives here? My daughter, Lea, uh, Leanne. She's up in her bedroom. Okay. Coffee? It started late last year. Just before Christmas, I was alone in the house, and I could hear this laughing. I couldn't figure out where it was coming from at first. I thought it might be Lea, but nothing. There was no one there. And I looked everywhere, turning the place upside-down, but nothing, no one. Then the occurrences became, stronger. I could feel her around me. I wouldn't see her at first, that came later. But when I did see her? That's when it all heightened. Everything became worse. I saw her. The Candywitch. A satanist, in my house. When you say "Candywitch," you mean Jennifer Harper, don't you? Yes. What are you doing? Sorry. Kat, nice to meet you. - I came here today with the... - Paranormal investigator? What relevance does she have with this house? Usually, a spirit has some kind of attachment to either a home, or a resident. We found markings on the children one evening. I was bathing Lea, and I found, on her legs, these marks. Of course, first thing I do is check Tom for similar markings, and he has them, across his back. She'd been whipping the children. Hurting them. Scolding them for god-knows what reason. When we confronted the children, they denied she'd done these things. They were young. They didn't want to get her in trouble, you see? When we found out, we expelled her from the house. And the town's children began vanishing? Old wives tales. Nothing was ever confirmed. But, if it walks like a duck. Don't mind him. - Keith, this is Kat. - We met briefly downstairs. We sure did. The Ghostbusters are here. Mom is totally wasting her money on this, right? The gift Reece has, it's real. So, he what, speaks to dead people? Oh, god, do his eyes roll back when he connects to the spirit world? He can see them and we help them move on. Using their energy, he can help them. What's that you got in your hand? An EMF reader. And that is? It's a way of measuring ambient electromagnetic fields. It tells us when something from the other side is close by. Oh, cool! So you bring props into this studio production of yours too. I bet your Insta followers love that. You knew her? She was our nanny. She did that? I don't remember, we were kids when she did it to us. You and your brother? She would lose her temper with us. Scold us when our parents were out. I'm so sorry. Locals call her the Candywitch. She used to hand candy canes out to the little kids. Have you seen her, the Candywitch? I bet you're dying for me to say yeah, right? Your mom asked us to help her. We're here for her, and for you. It's not nice to feel you can't breathe in your own home. It looks like your ghost doesn't wanna be found. Last night, a neighbor. I suppose you saw the police tape. Boiled alive, they say. In melting chocolate. It's her. The Candywitch, she's back. Sometimes, a spirit, it can just be that of a host. Something we remember. And those memories can be manipulated by an energy so evil that sometimes it can trick a victim into believing it's the memories of someone they knew. Do you believe in evil? Well, I do. And that's what that lady was. You have to help me, Reece. You have to help me get rid of her, once and for all. Please. It's gonna be all right, son. You understand? None of us have slept in weeks. If this doesn't work, you have to do something. My mind just keeps replaying what she did, over and over again in my head. Can we just move out? This house has been in my family for generations. I'm not gonna give that up. If she's here, if she wants this house, she's gonna have to go through me. You understand? I'm gonna take a bath. Tiffany's coming over later. Tiffany! You check with your mother. You know she doesn't want that girl in this house. I live here too, Dad. Something's definitely here. Of that, I'm sure. Hey, come on, let's go into town. There's someone I think we should meet. Who? Well, I did some research, and this lady, Miss Carmel, has some really strong opinions on what happened. I think she's worth taking a look, and she's happy to be filmed, too. You go, I need to feel this energy out. You sure? Yeah, just go. Okay. Don't go! Your family have lost their mind, Lea. Ghost hunters running around, come on! Yeah, I get that, but you were meant to be here for me. I am here for you, but, it's college break and I need to unwind. And I need a stress-free time, before I go back next semester, all right? Look, come to the mess party. You're going to that party? Is that what this is all about? You're just using my family as an excuse? I said you can come if you wanted to. I said I was going, days ago. No, you said it would be cool to go. No, I said I was going. Do you wanna go or not? I'm good. All right, see ya. Tom! Tom! Tommy, you're gonna be all right. Tom, oh, poor boy. What happened, Tom? Reece, what's going on here? The hell's going on? Ah, fuck, no connection. Shit. Where the hell am I? Oh, god. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Yes! Hey, Lexi. Show me the way home. Yes! All right, let's get the hell outta here. Hello? Anyone in? What are you doing on my boat? So. What are you doing on my boat? The Candywitch. Her name was Jennifer Harper. I don't refer to her like the locals do. It's insulting to name the dead. The dead? Yes. I haven't seen any proof of her death. What, you think she just picked up, packed up and left? What do you wanna know about her? I saw an article online. You think she's dead, something happened to her. My boyfriend, he's a psychic medium. He was brought here by the people at 106. Cronehill Farm? Ruth and her family? Oh, please. What, they think the past has come back to haunt them now, do they? Sorry? If Jennifer Harper is up there, somewhere, looking down on us, then I hope she is messing with them, 'cause hell knows they deserve it. Come on, come on, come on. Hey. Excuse me? Hello? Um, I'm lost in the woods? My phone's died and... Yo, hello? Hey, excuse me. Hello? Hey, yo! They said she was abusing their children. It's a small town. Reputation is everything. You don't think she hurt the children? I don't know what went on in that house, but all I know is, she loved all children. She always wanted to have a baby. This town is full of rumors. Dirty little secrets. And the more you tell a rumor, the more people believe it. People go missing all the time in a place like this. My own daughter ran when she was 15. Just needed to get out. I should've done more. What happened on the lead up to her disappearance? The rumors were spreading like wildfire. She was supposedly abusing those children. Tom. And Lea. Apparently the kids were claiming she was beating them. Then rumor had it, she was abducting children. But it was all a myth. How are you so sure? She came round here one time. She wanted help. I let her in my home. Evil, malicious rumors spreading. She couldn't take it. She had said things weren't going well at the house with the kids. That rumors were spreading, that Ruth was starting to not trust her anymore. I should've helped her. I failed her, and I regret it every day. I didn't know what to believe. Deep down, I knew she didn't have it in her, to do those things. But I went along with it, and I asked her to leave. Sent her back to them. She came here, asking for help. Claiming I was the only one left who could help her. She begged me not to send her back to them. But I turned my back on it. And I believe I am part of the reason why... Why she vanished. Where do you think she went? I think this town are responsible. They did something to her. I don't know what, but this town are the reason why she is no longer here. And if it is true, what you say, that she is back, that she is here, for them, then they have a price to pay. Your parents are looking into the pipework. Useless. Do you need some help? What's the point? It's never gonna stop, is it? What are you saying? She did things. To me. When I was younger, about 15, 16. You know, at that age, you're growing, and learning and... The worst part is I felt fucking special. Now I... People say that ghosts don't exist, but, everyone's haunted. I just want her to be gone. Where have you been today, sweetie? I went for a walk around. Got some pickup shots of your lovely little village. I think that'll edit together really nicely. I, uh, been informed by a neighbor that you been visiting that crazy lady on the river, Trish? I did. We would really appreciate you just sticking to your job. Instead of listening to the crazy rants of some woman who's half lost her mind. I didn't mean to intrude. Look, ignore her, she's struggling. We haven't slept a decent night in weeks. That'll be Tiff. - Hey. - Hey. Come on. I'm never gonna get tired of this house. Thanks for coming out here. Oh, this is Kat, she's doing some stuff around the house. Everyone into the dining room. Jennifer? If that is y... And if you are here. If it is true that you are here, with us, in death... Then I am sorry for turning my back on you. So, what's the plan behind this? A seance. To connect to Jennifer. Whoever it is I feel within the walls of this house. You have seen it? I believe there is something here. The Candywitch? I need to make sure it is her, and not a spirit within a shell. So, what are we gonna do? We hold hands. We breathe, in the same rhythm. And at no point do we break the circle. Take each other's hands. I'll take over now while Reece connects to the other side. Will this expel the spirit? This is about communication. Finding out what it wants from the house, from the family. Everybody close your eyes and lower your heads. Start to take a deep breath in through your nose, and slowly out through your mouth. Keeping calm, out through your mouths. Giving up your energy for those passed to use. Allowing them to connect to us in this very moment in which we live in. Spirit. I ask for your presence. I offer you our energy. A place to be present. A place to be listened to. To be seen. Is it working? Please be silent. Spirit. When I open my eyes, be present. Stand before me. Someone tell me what's going on? Spirit. I'm trying to communicate with you. I mean you no harm. I'm here to help you. What is going on? Spirit, why do you come here? Something is in this room with us, isn't it? Someone answer me, what is going on? No, I can't! Ruth, no! What'd you see? Does it hurt? She's here. And she's got a grudge so deep, so bitter and twisted. I've never dealt with anything like this before. What happened in there? Nothing. Your hearing, if this is affecting you, with your health, we've gotta give it up. Reece, it's not worth it. No, I can't give up on this now. I, I think we should go home. The fans won't mind, we can spin it as a, I don't know, a beast we couldn't tame. Where are you going? What did you see? We gotta get inside that shed. You're gonna need these. That circle... Seance thing? I don't know how you guys did it. Lea? You've gotta believe us, we didn't do anything. Fine. But I wanna see what you're up to. Tiff, wait. Wait. Relax. Tiffany. Ow, my back hurts. Tiffany, my back. Tiff, it hurts. This is what you wanted, isn't it, Tom? Tom. What? What is it? What is it? Don't know what I'm looking for, but, she wanted me to find something in here. Oh, my god. I remember this. It's all our stuff from when we were kids. Why do your parents keep it locked up? I guess they use it as storage. What's this? Oh I think that's our family photo album. Yeah. Jennifer should be inside here. Yeah, look. There's me. Tom. And Jennifer. So, I'm intrigued. What exactly do you think she wanted you to find in here? I'm not sure. But whatever it is, she wanted us to uncover it. It might end this for your family. The neighbor, Trish, she... She said she thinks the rumors might be lies. She doesn't think Jennifer committed any crimes. I have the scars the prove it. And my brother has the most disturbing memories of her doing horrendous things to him. She's pure evil. Whatever that crazy lady told you was a lie. Please don't go. I wanna support you, but I think you need to get the hell out of here. Well, come on, come with me. I wanna move on, really, I do, but... Well, then leave! Now. I can't leave my family. Well, I'm leaving this house now, and I want you to follow me. May I? What year did she join you as your nanny? Oh, god. '97? Reece? What were you doing outside at this time of night? I don't understand. That matches the marks on my legs. Your mom has a walking stick? And they owned it before Jennifer begun working here? This could be more. Oh, god, no. You were supposed to help get rid of that spirit. But all you have done is cause problems here, in my house. I wanted you to get rid of her. I didn't want you to give her a voice. Mom! Dad! Where's Tom? You abused those children. It wasn't her. When I was a little girl, my mother did far worse. A little discipline didn't hurt anyone. This was all you. Why couldn't you just keep your mouth shut? She's here because of what you did to her. She had it coming. All that she got, she deserved, I assure you. Why did you do it? Why did you allow her to take the blame for your children's abuse? You don't have children. No, I looked. All your pretty little perfect life online. She touched him! That disgusting, filthy bitch, defiled my son. No mother, no parent, would ever let anyone like that not suffer. She tore this family to pieces. It was justice that her partner came to know what kind of person she was. She found him hanging from the ceiling the next day. I didn't feel sorry for her in the slightest. She is a monster. You must see that. Tiffany? Tiffany? Hey, hey, hey, Tiff! Tiff, wake up, hey! Hey, can you hear me? Tiff! Tiff, can you, Jesus Christ, Tiff! Dad? Dad, what are you doing? We need to find Tom. Have you seen him? You knew, and you didn't say anything? No, because if I had, more people would be hurt. He was obsessed with her. How long? Years. All the letters he wrote, she kept. I thought it was mutual, but after she rejected him, he made the accusations. She was the innocent one all along? I need to go find Tom. Lea. No! Get off me! Jesus Christ, Jen. Listen to me, please! Please, she didn't do anything! She didn't do anything, please listen to me! Jennifer! Jennifer, listen! Please. Please listen. Fuck! Fuck! God! You made her out to be a monster, that's why there was no proof of those town's children vanishing. It was just town's gossip out of control. I had to make sure that the town hated her. I wanted the town to hate her, to fear her. So that when she went missing, no one would care. No one would miss her. That's why she's here. That's why she won't leave you alone. 'Cause she has a grudge so deep to the core, that she can't, she won't move on. What's the one thing you would do if someone hurt your child, if they touched your child in that way? You would make sure they could never do it again. You killed her. We buried her out back, behind the house. We buried her, hoping that no one would ever find her. Just kill me! Just kill me. Tom! Kat? I think we need to go, this really isn't safe. - What? - Reece, we need to leave now. There is more to this family than we know about. I know, Ruth told me. She knew too, about Tom? What? He lied! He was obsessed with her and when he couldn't have her, he made it seem like she'd abused him. But, Ruth, she killed her. For Tom? Oh, my god. We need to call the police. Are you okay? It's not leaving. Reece, what's happening? She's sure, I can feel it. We need to find her bones. She can't move on because they've kept them here. And she will kill anyone that's pained her until we find them. Guys? We need to find him. If it's true, he's not safe. He was with Tiffany. What the hell is that? Why is the car door open? Oh. Oh, my god! It's Tiffany. Tom! Tom. No. Tom. Oh, my god. Oh, my god, my baby, what has she done to you? Oh, no, no. Reece, where are you taking us? She said she buried her. This land, the energy here is deafening. She... Jennifer! We used to get along, what're you doing? You! Knew! I never hurt you! Jennifer, I never did anything to you! You did nothing! You need to leave my family alone. You need to leave! What're you doing? You need to go! Leave! Now! Your name is nothing to be ashamed of. You will no longer die with those memories. And your body... Your body has been found. You can move on now. Is that it? Did it work? It worked. Dad! Reece, honey. You're okay. Did you call the police? Are you okay? Are you hurt in any way?
