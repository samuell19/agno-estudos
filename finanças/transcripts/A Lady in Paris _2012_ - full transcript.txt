Here you have the washing machine, the medicine cabinet. Do you have the keys? Here... Guard the keys and keep it locked, in case she tries again. What do you mean? You didn't tell her? Was going to. She attempted suicide. Arrived in time but she'd taken all the pills in the cabinet. Why? Just feeling down. It can happen to anyone. I'm off. Good luck. For your expenses. One month's pay in advance. If you have any problems, call me. My numbers are on here. Or drop by my cafe. It's not far. You'll see, Frida speaks her mind. Don't be pushed around. Good night. - Good night. Good morning, madam. I'm your home carer. My name is Anne. What did Stephan tell you about me? Excuse me, thought that you spoke Estonian. No. Did he tell you I'm a poor, sick and lonely Estonian? No. Right... Go tell him don't need anybody. And pack your bags. And the faster it's done, the better. Don't look like that. Didn't ask you to come here. Take away that tray. Hello. - Hello. Is something wrong? - No-no... Excuse me. We're rushed off our feet. Take a seat at the bar, we'll talk later, okay? Sit down here. Olivier, a coffee for the lady. So, Anne, go ahead. Madam fired me. Thought as much. What happened? Don't know. She didn't touch her breakfast. Made something simple - vegetable soup and ham... Sorry, should've said. She has tea and croissants. And then? She said she didn't need anybody. Stephan, can you come over here? - I'll be right there. Please give it another try, nice and easy, okay? How can go back if she doesn't want me there? Come with me. Rest assured, you're not the first she sent away, far from it. Need someone to look after her, she can't be on her own. Don't know what you expected, but warned the agency that Frida wasn't easy. They said, no problem, you were a professional. Didn't bring you here to give up at the first hurdle. You'll stay, won't you? Thank you. Was there anything else? - No. I've got to go back. Call if there's a problem. She's staying then? Good morning. - Hello. 12.60 euros. Thanks. Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. It slipped out of my hands. You must ask me, Frida, if you want some tea. Don't call me Frida! You came back to pack? Did you see Stephan? Did he buy you a plane ticket? I'm just here to help. You're too weak to live alone. You smothered yourself in perfume. Did anyone ever tell you not to mix scents? And nobody told you not to take your shoes off indoors? Everybody does back home. In Estonia. Yes. rest my case. It's mom. Apparently, you're not home. Just wanted to talk to you. I'm doing fine here. It's going really well. I'm a bit tired as haven't quite settled in yet hope you're both well. I'll call back another time. Lots of love. Here it is! Your breakfast. Here you go. Madam, you must eat. You'll lose your strength. You expect me to eat plastic? You don't understand? A real croissant is something you buy in a bakery, not in a supermarket. Didn't Stephan tell you that? It's impossible to eat that. A good croissant and a good cup of tea are the only and last things have left to get up for in the morning. Split some. I've spill a bit more. You say nothing'? Goon... Go away, go for a walk. Excuse me... Sorry. What are you doing'? Can you tell me why the door to my medicine cabinet is locked? Did you lock it? Where's the key'? If you tell me what you want, I'll get it. I'd like to know why, in my house. I'm not allowed the key to my medicine cabinet. My orders are to keep it locked. Your orders are to keep it locked'? Yes. Am not as yet insane. I'm in my own home and give the orders. Give me the key! I'm sorry, but can't. know what you will do. Nobody has ever told me what to do. Where is she? - In the living room. Hello. Hello. Won't come running every time you call. Next time, won't be here. Have other things to do. Know. You have your cafe to run. How's it going with your bottle blonde? Have you dumped her yet? - Yes. I'm single again. But she was a real blonde. - She was? A real blonde? suppose you should know. She wasn't dyed then? Just insipid. No, she wasn't so... - You weren't very in love. Have you replaced her'? - No. You will, soon. Don't know. - know. If you're so sure... Be careful of immigrants. The; re worse than blondes. What about you? A blonde immigrant. Bring in the immigrant in the hallway, listening in on us. Anne? Could you come here for a moment? Anne... Stephan here is the only person to visit me regularly. If only to check if I'm not dead. But can't blame him. He's a lovely man. Now tell this woman that this apartment really is my apartment. That's right. And that am allowed access to the key to my medicine cabinet in my apartment. There are limits to my affection for you. Really'? Your affection? So you hire an immigrant to watch over me'? There's no pleasing you. - No. There's no pleasing me. Seeing you pleases me. You used to come to the cafe every day. Yes, but don't like going out now. Don't like making my own tea, my own breakfast in the morning. You see? Anne's here to help you. Can be your hands and legs. It's what I'm here for. You can keep your legs and arms Have you looked at yourself? You could be nicer. Who'd blame her if she left? She can go. didn't ask her to come. You know I'll have to get someone else. Yes, suppose so. You want me to replace her'? Do you'? No, you're the one want. And want the key to my medicine cabinet. No. Screw you! - Screw you, too! I'll be going now. See? You're much better now. - Yes. Knew it. You'll see... Things will be much better. You saw her. She doesn't want me here. No, it's settled Kind of... So... You're her son? No, sons don't usually sleep with their mothers. You sleep with Frida? Of course not. A long time ago. Doesn't she have any children? Frida? No. She has nobody. Her husband's long dead. She had lovers, then she had me. But her family in Estonia? Frida's been in France almost her whole life. She has no contact with them. She has nobody except you and me. You... and me. Will you be okay'? Yes. Fine. Right... When will you be back'? - No idea. Anne? What did he tell you? That you're alone. You have nobody any more. How much does he pay you? I'm not here for the money. Why'd you come to Paris'? My mother died and... couldn't stay cooped up in the house. Don't you have a man in your life? I've been divorced 12 years. So you came to look after an old woman like me'? Pick up the pieces of the cup, then go change the sheets on my bed. Paris Sings in Estonian Hello, what can get you? Hello. Two croissants, please. Butter ones. - Two butter croissants. Please. You see? You can do it after all. Was it over Stephan that you tried to kill yourself? You want to know? He does a lot for you. He must love you a lot. It's not as simple as that. Delicious. - Thank you. Hello. - Hello. Excuse me, read that people from Estonia in Paris meet in here. You're an Estonian? Yes. You, too? - Yes. Hello. - Hello! Read that this church is where Estonians in Paris meet up. No, not for at least ten years now. If wanted to meet other Estonians, would that be possible? Actually... Not any more. The old folks died or went to Estonia and the young aren't interested. That's a shame. What do you do in Paris? Work here. I'm a home carer for a lady here, Mrs. Murat. Frida! How is she? She's fine. Yes, she's in fine form. You know her'? She sang in the choir with us. Yes, saw the photos. - don't believe it... She kept them'? - Yes, why wouldn't she? Frida was never very close to the other Estonians. Her lifestyle was rather free and easy, if you see what mean. Well then, I'd better be going. Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Sorry, couldn't help. You want me to make tea? Yes, why not'? At the time, my husband was still alive. He was much older than me. Avery elegant man. Very calm and, above all, very kind. One day, noticed a new young man waiting on the tables. He'd just arrived in Paris. His name was Stephan. He was full of charm. He'd come to my table to serve me always with a smile and a twinkle in his eye. Our affair lasted a few years. Afterward s, we stayed in touch He had other ?ings, of course. So did. But none of any importance. He'd drop by to see me at home, after he finished work and he'd tell me everything. Or I'd go to the cafe. He and my husband are the men Where do you go alone at night? Just walk. Walk? You're not seeing anyone? Went for long walks in Paris when first arrived. What have you seen in Paris? Haven't had time, but I'd love to go to the Louvre. I've never been. Except one time. Couldn't get in. They were on strike It doesn't matter, you know. Real Parisians never visit the Louvre. Have an idea... Let's go to the cafe. Are you sure? It's not too far'? - No, you'll come with me. Wear one of your little outfits. - Yes. I'm ready. - Let's see... Very nice. But you can't wear that. I'll find you something more chic. This. Try this on. Let's see... As a teenager, wanted to be a stage actress. In Estonia, before the Russians arrived, lots of artists dreamed of going to Paris. Got here, but never became an actress. Let's see... The raincoat really suits you. Suits you better than me. It's yours. Thank you. You're pretty, you know. If you wanted to... How long since you slept with a man? Me? Won't sleep with a man if don't love him. You mean that if a smart, good-looking guy wanted to sleep with you, you'd say no? Honey, start by loving yourself. We'll have to change that. Nearly there. They won't believe their eyes! Actually, Anne, wail here a moment. Want to surprise them. Dominique! Good to see you again. How are you? - Fine. Olivier... Good afternoon. Maurice! - Frida. Do you want your table? If may. - Of course. But you can stay. Take a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Stephan... It's a surprise. - It is. What do you want? I'll have a vodka, please. With lots of ice. Fine. One vodka. - Thank you. Frida... It's good to see you. Maurice, you're as green as ever. This cafe must be my elixir of youth. My dear Maurice, it's an illusion. We're both old now. Anne, you're a miracle worker. Thank you. Tell me, Stephan, why, in this cafe, are there always the same men, Women soon fire of what's on offer here, but men are more loyal. Nicely put. Sit down, sweetie. Pleased to see me'? - Sure, I'm pleased to see you. Are you very busy just now? Have a life, you know. And... It can't revolve around just you. Yes, know. You must understand that. Have understood. Goon. Thank you. Frida! You must eat. Made an Estonian meal for you today. You can't gel the right produce here. In any case... don't want it, thank you. It's you she needs, not me. What do do? Chain myself to her feet? You don't care about her? That's not the point. - It is the point! For you, she's already dead. Anne, wait! You come here and think you've got it all worked out, but you're wrong. God knows loved Frida. That's for sure. She bought me the cafe long after we split up. A gift. No strings attached. Not for long... Does this cafe mean that my life's all about Frida? What am to do? Madam'? Frida! Don't worry. It's bad for your health. I'll be going to bed soon. Switch off the light. Frida! Your friends from the Estonian choir called to ask how you're doing. After all these years? Talked with Mrs. Tamm. Lydia? - Yes. What did she say? She said they'd like to see you Anne? Come here. Sit down. Like your shoes. Thanks. What will you do when I'm dead'? You're not going to die now. - might die just like that, any time. Maybe I'll go back to Estonia to be buried with my mother. You know how found out she'd died? One day, my brother sent me a letter, asking me to send jeans, perfumes, marker pens... And he'd slipped into the envelope the memorial card announcing my mothers death. She'd been dead for a month. Never replied. And never heard from them again. Ever again. Do you regret that'? Open the door. Hello. Frida... Good afternoon. Hello. My dear Frida. - Lydia. You seem in fine form. - Thanks. Please, take a seat. Serve the tea Would you like some tea? - Yes, with pleasure. There you go. - Thanks. When Anne called us, we found out that you were ill. How are you feeling now? I'm just fine. Don't speak so loud, can hear you. So, Anne called you? That's right. She thought a visit from us would cheer you up. And we thought that after all this time... Yes, over twenty years. We were in Brussels last week. For a concert. We thought back to that day you took us to the seaside to sing over the sound of the waves. Out of curiosity, if Anne hadn't called you, would you have come to see me? Look, Frida... Maybe you don't know, but Erik never went back to Mathilde. We shouldn't be apologizing for a marriage you wrecked. Truly hoped that you'd show some regret now. Think you got the wrong door and the wrong day. Clearly, you haven't changed a bit. Just as we expected. Madam has no regrets. You haven't changed either. Sorry, have nothing more to say. You can leave. I've had enough. She's even lost her Estonian. Tell me, my dear Endel, if you're such a good Estonian, such a patriot, why do you still live in France 20 years after your country was freed? You're asking me that? You think we've forgotten, how you earned a living before your marriage? Please, Frida, take no notice of him. Remember clearly in what state you arrived in France. You were happy to live under my roof and off my earnings. - Frida, I'm sorry... This is very embarrassing. can't stay any longer. That's fine. - I'm sorry, Frida. Absolutely fine. Goodbye. - No. Farewell! Show them out. Happy now'? You got what you wanted'? Why did you lie to me'? Think... - You think too much! Sit down here with me. Hope you understand why hate them, these venerable Estonians in Paris. 50 years ago, slept with a married man. Big deal! Didn't rape him! All these years later, they drag it back up. And you... With your clear conscience and your goody-goody air... My poor girl, your whole life all you'll ever be is an Estonian peasant! Know your mothers dead. Bull have bad news for you ... don't plan on taking her place. - That's enough! Stop it. Just cut that out. Being unhappy gives you no right to be so cruel. If you're all alone now, you only have yourself to blame. Stephan tries to love you... - Get out! But he's right not to stop by. If you so want to die, jump. Jump out the window! Love my body too much to smash it on a sidewalk. Get out now! Hello. I'm here to see Mr. Bourdet. He's upstairs. - You're leaving? Yes. Can see him? This way, I'll show you up. Leave your suitcase here. Up the stairs, on the left. - Thanks. Hello, Anne. I'm leaving. Just came to say I'm going that's all. Guess it was bound to happen. What you said the other day, you were right. Was waiting for her to die know. Just like waited for my mother to die. What will you do now? I'm going home. Anne! Can you come here? Anne? You came. Am a monster? You act as if you are. And Anne? Has she gone? Come here next to me. What are you doing'? Memories... I'm here. Stephan... You must have slept together, but it's okay. Why did you let her go? Excuse me, madam, you can't stay here. The station's closing. Sorry. Excuse me. You're still here? Are you okay? I'm fine. Hello. - Hello! You didn't leave? My ?ight's this afternoon. Is Mr. Bourdet here? No, he called to say he wouldn't be in today. Here. - Thank you. Hi, Stephan. Dominique! Where is she? Don't know. She didn't say, she just left. It's good you came back. - No. Just thought should say farewell. Anne! Is that you? Do you want to come in? Don't know. Anne... This is your home, here. Don't just stand there. Subtitles: Simon John
