I thought you had to go out? I sent my wife. I'm no good at funerals. That's not right! It's bigger than this. Watch what you're doing! - Are you worried? - About what? Just leave it to him. You don't need to worry. You're too easy. Watch out! Who did this? Who put this here? - Takeshi! - Yes? Tidy up around here, will you? Right. He's only 26. He's doing pretty good. No, he's still immature. It takes 20 years in a shop like this. He's only been here five years. But in those five years, you've drummed everything into him. I've even felt sorry for him just watching. He may be your son, but you don't have to be so strict. Yelling at him and slapping him... Tsune. It was no small feat for you and me to make this factory what it is now. That's no reason to scold him all the time. Hey, he's tired of waiting and he's playing his harmonica now. I haven't heard it in a long time. He used to play it a lot. He's sulking up there. You should get him dinner as soon as he gets home. Your vegetable tempura is too complicated. Just some eel would've done. You can call him down now. But there's nothing here. Hey, Takeshi. Yes? We're having tempura tonight. Oh, that's great. Come on down. Dad, can you hang on? I want to talk to you. Right. That's it, huh? You say that, but - Well, I've been worried about it for quite a while now. But I've got you in charge now. I figured you'd have some ideas. That sure puts me on the spot. What? You can't think of anything? That's not true. I have some ideas. Like what? I think now's the time to get more people. Maybe five or six good tradesmen. Well, that shouldn't be too hard. Yeah, but - Dear? What are you doing? Come on down. It's getting cold. We'll be right there. Now she's rushing us. But who knows what'll happen later after taking on that many workers. Takeshi, Japan's growing by leaps and bounds. The whole economy is expanding, so we've got to catch the wave. Then I can do as I see fit? If you think it's the right thing to do, just go for it. It's decided then. I'm going to get another five guys. Here. What are you chuckling to yourself about? When I went upstairs Takeshi said he had something to talk to me about. I thought I would get yelled at again. You were praised instead. What is this about? I thought he was going to bring up Kyoko. Why? That wasn't it? Just a chat between men. You were playing the harmonica before. That was ?Home on the Range?? That's right. The same as the record Kyoko brought when she visited, right? Well, anyway - Remember when we met her and she asked about hobbies? I was completely stumped. Why would you be stumped? You've played the harmonica since you were a kid. But I couldn't say the harmonica was my hobby. We laughed so hard afterwards. That's great. You should be proud. You really think Kyoko wants to come live with us in this house? She says she can't wait. - That's what the girlfriend said? - Yeah. Come, now. Still calling her ?the girlfriend?? Maybe I'll call Yoshikawa and go out fishing for a change. Thanks. What should I do? Maybe I'll have another. - You want me to get that? - The burdock root tempura is tasty. - Hey, Takeshi - - What? You'd better take an umbrella. It's pretty much stopped. It hasn't stopped. I don't need an umbrella. Oh, come on. It's rainy season. It'll come down again. I'm off, then. - Use the umbrella. - Right. Right. Just be safe. The highway can be dangerous. You're lucky being an only son. They found a nice girl for you. It's not like I didn't do any of the work. Have you decided on the wedding yet? Yeah, they're saying maybe September or October. Farmers have to work it around the seasons. I wonder what Iida is like. It's up the Tenryu River. Way up in the Shinshu Mountains, then? Come on. She's not some country hick. She even knows what records I like. I know. Even though I met her briefly. Anyway, both my parents come from the Shinshu region. They might like her more than I do. Give me a break. You're head over heels for her. I guess. Hey, you got one. Another goldfish. He's pretty good, considering the youth of today, that Takeshi of ours. And Kyoko is a nice girl. She's coming out all the way from Iida. Adorable girl. Don't you think? Are you asleep? Women sure don't have any worries. I'm listening. If you're listening, you could answer. I suppose, but what time is it? The clock struck 10:00 a little while ago. It's past 10:00? So you were asleep. Takeshi's late. Leave him be. It's Sunday tomorrow. Kyoko is a lovely girl. Oh, you were listening. What do you want? Why? Who are you? Hold it! What's the matter? You're badly injured! Let's get you to the hospital! - Please get him! - Is there a hospital nearby? Get that young man! Hey! Someone help me! Hello? Yes? Yukie! Did something happen to Takeshi? Someone stabbed him. Stabbed? Why? I don't know! Let's get to the hospital! Get yourself ready right away! We don't need an umbrella! Just lock up! Hurry up! Are you all right, dear? I'm fine! Let's hurry! FATAL STABBING ON THE WAY HOME TSURUMI WELDING SHOP What a terrible thing. Her husband's lost his strength. He won't get out of bed. I can't blame him. It was his only son, after all. He's in bed upstairs. Auntie? Can you come? There's a police detective at the door. Excuse me, Madam. Have you found the culprit? No. Not yet. I'm returning this. An umbrella left at the scene. I think it's your son's. Yes, it is. And this was at the scene as well. Yes, that's right. He told me at the hospital that the goldfish was for me - Allow me to offer my respects. Thank you. I'll do that for you. Auntie, you have to stay strong. Uncle can't get out of bed. You have to stay strong, Auntie. That's right. I have to stay strong. Go show this to Uncle. Can you go show it to him? I'll just break down again. I suppose. I'll go for you. Auntie, Kyoko's here with her father. Mrs. Kawase - Kyoko - This is simply terrible. I can't begin to express my grief. Anyway, we hurried here at once. Thank you for travelling so far. Please come in. This is Kyoko's mourning attire. Let me take it. It was made along with her other wedding things. Who could have known it would be needed so soon. Please don't say such things, Father. What's happening? He couldn't bear looking at it. He said to show it to Takeshi. I suppose. My husband's upstairs. He's been in bed since last night. I'd like to see him. Sure. Saburo, can you go tell your uncle? I'll go offer some incense first. Please. Uncle, Kyoko's just arrived. She's coming up now. Mr. Kawase - Did Takeshi really die? Kyoko - Dad, please avenge me! I will! I will! I'll definitely avenge you! Takeshi! Takeshi! Dear! SUMMER, 1940 SPRING, 1941 SPRING, 1949 It's difficult to say right now. If only we could stop the bleeding. The wound is deeper than we thought. There's a major injury to his intestinal tract. You slept well. That's the best thing for you. Father. What is it? What we talked about yesterday. About what? You think we can find five or six skilled workers so easily in these times? We'll find them. Don't worry. I have some connections. I guess. Don't worry about that now. Don't think of anything, and just sleep. Just sleep. That's what you need to do. - Dad. - What is it? We need a better way... to haul in the steel. The way we do it now - You don't have to worry about it now. Don't be silly. You should only be thinking about getting better. Don't think about work, all right? Dad! Get the nurse! - Oh! What is it? - Dad! Nurse! Please avenge me! I will! I will! I'll definitely avenge you! Takeshi! Takeshi! Takeshi? Dear! Hey, Takeshi! Dear! Doctor! Takeshi! Oh, Takeshi! He's in the inner room. Go right in. I'm sorry I couldn't be at the funeral. I thought I'd offer some incense. I want to express my deepest sympathy. Thank you. But I'm at a loss for words. Mr. Matsuzaki, it's kind of you to offer your sympathy, but what is this? You wrote this, right? You covered it at the hospital. That's right. ?According to police, their investigation revealed that there was no evidence of robbery, so it might've been a random fight, or an attack motivated by a grudge which resulted in the stabbing?. I wrote it that way because that was in the police report. But we heard about it at the hospital. A complete stranger approached him. He himself told us that! - But they need to have a motive - - There is no motive! They need a motive in order to proceed with an investigation. Are you saying Takeshi was lying? - He wasn't lying - - But that's what you're implying! I was just - Takeshi was not one to get into fights or have anyone hold a grudge against him. Like I said, the police said - Who cares about the police? You're a newspaper! Why can't you write the truth? That's enough, Saburo. There's no sense getting angry at him. Takeshi wouldn't appreciate that. Hello? Thank you for coming the other day. Madam, a suspect was brought into custody. Just a few minutes ago. Dear! His sister's husband practically dragged him in. He's a 19-year-old boy by the name of Noboru Ishimoto. Nineteen years old. It was thanks to your newspaper article. You wrote a detailed description of his age, appearance, and clothes. Yes. That's what did it. He suddenly got frightened and apparently ran to his sister's. They scolded him harshly. It's hard to believe, but he's practically a child. In that rain, on that bridge - You're saying you waited almost an hour? So why did you do it? What was the reason? There's no point in hiding it now. Spit it out. - What'll happen to me? - What? - Will I be executed? - Hey, don't change the subject. We can talk about all that later. Just answer my questions. It could've been anyone. What? It was just chance. He just happened to come along. What do you mean? Hey, I want you to be straight with me. You'll pay if you're making this up. I'm not making it up! I actually wanted to kill more people! Women, old folks, and even children! What're you saying? Just shut up! He was just unlucky enough to come along! After questioning him further, we learned he'd tried to join a gang. But they insulted him terribly. We're looking into it now. Where are you going, dear? I'm going to bed. Can you lay out the bed for me? But he said that's what you told him. He then got angry, and that's what drove him - To commit murder. But that's his responsibility. Don't make me an accessory to it. Look. Let me be clear with you. I was honestly just kidding around with him. I didn't mean anything more than that. That's right. It's exactly as you were told. You see, that guy was good for nothing. He was raised by his stepmother. And his dad would get drunk and beat him up. I'm not surprised he's all messed up. Even with work, or anything, he just never got along with anyone. No wonder he goes out and does something stupid. How about dinner, dear? Dear, we'd better let Kyoko know as well. She's been so unfortunate. I hope she eventually finds a good husband. Kyoko really loved Takeshi. Kyoko mentioned before she left that she was worried about your eyes. How does she know about my eyes? Takeshi's known of it for some time, even before I noticed. Well, I guess it was quite a long time ago. When I was still working at the Oppama car plant. I went to see my dad at our metal shop. I noticed my dad stumbling a lot. I wondered why he was in such a rush. I wondered then if maybe he wasn't able to see his feet properly. - Did you mention this to your father? - Yeah, I told him to see a doctor. But he'd have none of it. And he got angry when I kept at him. As you know, he's a stubborn man. But I could tell from his expression that he was aware. Is that why you quit the car factory? You wanted to help your father? I wasn't feeling pity for my dad. I don't know how to put it. I was just impressed with him. I'd never realized that before. So - maybe I just thought I wanted to be more like him. Takeshi said that? He wanted to be a good successor to you. He was working hard for that. No matter how much you yelled at him. Hey, play that record for me. What record? You know the one. I can't. It'll just lead to tears. But I need to cry. I want to cry to soothe my heart! You've got to eat more, dear. For what purpose? Takeshi was killed. I can't believe you can just sit there and eat so calmly. You say things like that and I bet Takeshi would be mad at you. Stupid boy. What kind of son dies before his parents? Stupid boy! A proper craftsman puts his body into it! You got that? Takeshi, I don't want to live anymore. There's no point. No point to being alive. Tsune. Sorry to put this on you, but can you manage it for a while? Manage what? The metal shop. I'll let you manage it. Come on. What are you saying? I forced myself to go back there, but I just couldn't - It's tough being at the shop. Well, I'm sure the memories must come back. Please. He goes to the grave every day? Yes. Even on rainy days. Uncle's going to ruin his health. Well, he wouldn't even leave the house before. Maybe this is better. Do you want me to stay for a while? Maybe he's lonely. Maybe you can come occasionally. But finding a grave site so close sure was a good thing. It would've been tough if he had to travel far. Listen, Sabu. I think he wants to die. I can tell that very easily. That's why he won't eat. I guess that's what it means. Revenge. I just don't know how to get revenge. Takeshi, how am I to do it? Tomorrow morning at 10:00, at Yokohama District Court. I figured you wouldn't have known. We haven't heard from anyone, neither the police nor the court. Well, that's no surprise. - Please. - Oh, thank you. - Please come in. - Yes. Thank you. - Here. - Thank you. Why wouldn't they tell us? Well, it?s just not their custom. Except for specific summons to appear as witnesses, there's no precedent for notifying victims. Then we're just abandoned? Abandoned? Well, it?s just the way the system works. I see. I didn't know any of this. You might feel you don't want to see the assailant's face. But if you do wish to, you're free to attend the hearing. Anyway, I just thought I'd let you know. Thank you. Hello? They're back. The trial's tomorrow. At 10:00 in the morning. - Where? - The court in Yokohama. Who's here? Mr. Matsuzaki came all this way to - You're back. Mr. Matsuzaki, so it finally starts tomorrow? You've waited five months. Oh, hello. I thought I'd better come before you had a reason to yell at me. Not at all. I'm grateful to you. Well, I came because I've become fond of Mr. Kawase. But it'll still be a long while before there's a verdict, right? Yes, there'll be several sessions. But this one's simple. They know exactly what happened. That's not how trials work. They'll let him off easy. He's still a minor. Well, as far as that goes - Takeshi's dead, and the killer keeps on living. Dad, please avenge me! I will! I will! I'll definitely avenge you! Takeshi! YOKOHAMA DISTRICT COURT What a gloomy building. Well, it is a courthouse. A dismal place. Not a place to come too often. Of course not. Maybe we should go in now. Yes. I suppose. Hey, isn't that the - You're the one that killed Takeshi! Stop it! Uncle, stop it! Dear! Stop! I'm going to kill him! What - What do you think you're doing, Uncle? You'll end up in jail, too! And then what? Where did you get this? This is a courthouse. Please remain quiet, or you'll be found in contempt. I'm sorry. Who is he? The father of Takeshi Kawase, the murder victim. And this is his mother. And I'm his cousin. The hearing is about to begin. Then, it's all right? What is? Considering what just happened - I didn't see anything. What do you want to do, Auntie? Maybe we should just go home. Let's at least attend the hearing. Are you all right? FEBRUARY 27, 1967 SENTENCING Is that the court-appointed attorney? That's right. They say he has a family - But they didn't hire a lawyer for him. So that's how it is. All rise! The court is now in session. In the murder trial of the defendant, Noboru Ishimoto, the sentence shall now be given. The defendant shall step forward. The defendant is sentenced to a term of at least five years but no greater than 10. The defendant is sentenced to a term of at least five years but no greater than 10. The 160 days of remand shall apply towards the sentence. Facts and reasons as they pertain to the sentence. The defendant has had a habit of stealing since childhood. He attended elementary school at a Kanagawa correctional institution from which he escaped before graduating. He delivered newspapers but was sent to a reform school after committing theft. He was released in January of 1966. As the accused is a minor, consideration is given to him as one with future prospects, and an opportunity is granted to redeem himself in the future. Does it make you feel better to repeat that over and over? I want Takeshi to hear it! That kid was given... a lawyer paid for by the state. They sure are considerate of him, to have him redeem himself. He's in for a period of five to 10 years, which means he could be out in as soon as five years! After killing for no reason - What about the victim? No one's thinking of Takeshi! Nothing for being killed! The trial is held according to the law. The law is wrong! They say a guy like that has a future. I guess they mean Takeshi doesn't have one. That's no punishment. They're protecting a killer. That's all. TSURUMI WARD OFFICE LAW COUNSELLING I understand how you feel. But the law is as I've already explained. There's no law in Japan that considers the family of a murder victim? Or a man killed through no fault of his own? That's not so. There are some provisions. What would they be? Please tell me. There's a law concerning compensation for those cooperating with police. In other words, if you were cooperating with police, and you were injured in the course of trying to subdue an assailant, you can get compensation from the state. Maritime safety officials are also covered in the same way. And - there's a law concerning compensation for witnesses at a trial. This is for cases in which there is retribution against you for appearing as a witness in court. There's state compensation for that. Is that all? I think so - So there's nothing that applies to us. Yes. As far as compensation goes. I didn't come because I wanted money. What judgments do the law courts make anyway? They take good care of the criminal, but they do nothing for us victims. I'm home. Hello. I'm exhausted. What is this? - They're books. - Books? They sure are heavy. They didn't seem heavy when I bought them. Was I wrong. Yukie, get me some scissors. Sure. They're all law books? Isn't that great? What're you going to do with these? I'm going to read and study them. Study them? Going back to college or something? Don't be silly. People like us don't know much about the law. We have to educate ourselves, right? The goldfish look weak. Did you feed them? Just a while ago. I want you guys to stay healthy. I've got to stay healthy, too. You never know what'll come up. But you think you can read all these difficult books? I have no choice but to read them. ?Criminal Procedure Law?. Right? I'm counting on you. Madam. Well, it's been a while. It's gotten warmer now. How is your husband? He's gotten better. Still visiting the grave? He is. But only about once a week. He's gotten very busy of late. Signs and recognition of facts corresponding to actus reus. Rejection of illegality. What does this mean? Why don't they write it in plain Japanese? What a surprise. I never would have imagined. It's a bit frightening, actually. For such an upright, law-abiding man to say that the law is wrong. I came today because there's someone he might want to meet. And - A doctor? No, that's not it. Mr. Nakazawa runs a building products business. His daughter was murdered early last year. It was a similar type of incident to your son's. By early last year, that means two or three months before our son. Yes. There have been many similar incidents lately. It was an enormous blow to him, but he's recovering, and from what I've learned, he's hoping to draw public attention to the predicament of crime victims. Draw public attention? He's in Nerima? She was in the third year of university. She was born late in the year, so had just turned 20. She was studying piano and had gone out in the afternoon for her lesson. However - Somebody! Somebody! Hold it! Stop that man! There were six stab wounds. One of them proved fatal. She passed away before they could even call an ambulance. And the assailant? They said he was 26 years old. Hate what? What do you hate? Everything! It's not interesting to me! Couldn't care what happens to the world! That's when you decided to kill? It didn't matter who it was. I would've done in anyone who came along. But you were hiding in - Yeah. I wanted to get a woman. I hate women the most. Makes me sick just seeing them! I figured I'd do a woman if I was going to kill. She came wandering in like that. It's all her fault. It sounds like my son's case. Exactly the same. And the trial? He was sentenced to 15 years. Fifteen years. Not the death sentence? They said that was the ?going rate?. What's a ?going rate?? Who decided that? Well, I'd say that people far away from our situation made that decision. Then I suppose the five to 10 years in my son's case is also the ?going rate?? That may be so. That's absurd. I can't accept that. There's something wrong. I'm not going to back down until this is straightened out! But going after the killer now won't bring back those that were killed. But still, Mr. Nakazawa - To build a world free of such vicious crimes - I wouldn't want my daughter's death to be for naught. So I'm trying to figure out what to do. That's all I think about. I could never feel - It's as though you've reached a state of enlightenment. I'm no match for that. Mr. Nakazawa. Was that daughter your only child? I have two older sons. I see. You're very fortunate, unlike me. Mr. Kawase. I had three children. One is gone, but I have two left. Do you think that?s any consolation? I've said such a terrible thing. You know, Mr. Kawase, I'm being obstinate. I'm putting too much on others and myself, too. How else can I go on living? I find I can't even work. But there's one thing I realized after the incident. And it's that there's a surprising number of people who share our fate. I've been reading the papers, too. I never noticed before Takeshi's case that there are so many. What do you think? Maybe we can join forces and change some things. Join forces? Perhaps we can raise public awareness about this. Oh, there's Uncle. Uncle's here! I'll have your prints ready for you. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Hello, Uncle. I wanted to talk to you. Well, how unusual. It's been a while since I've come to this shop. What did you want to talk about? You once told me about a nearby welding shop. Yeah. A regular customer. And he wants to expand? Yeah. He said business is good, and he wants to expand. What were you thinking? I wonder if he'd buy our place? My shop. What'll you do if you sell the metal shop? There's something I'm thinking about. You decided this after talking with Mr. Nakazawa? He's not in a position to take time off work. He can't do the legwork, so I said I would - It'll cost money. And I can't be dedicated to the metal shop. I'll end up burdening Tsune and the rest of them. That's why I think it's best to get out. Have you made a deal to sell? Well, they're really interested. They're coming to look tomorrow. Of course they'll keep the people who work there now. Are you angry? For doing this before talking it over? Why would I be angry? I feel this is the only way to avenge Takeshi's death. I can never forgive the man who killed him. Obsessing over that rotten man will make me a rotten man. When I think that way, I just can't stop. I don't know what it is, but I feel that time is passing me by. I know it might mean some hardship for you, but I hope you'll support me. Even if I were to say I'm against it, you're not one to back down. Fine. If that?s what you've decided. Do as you please. Right. There's not much more in life that I want to do. I'm sorry. You really are something. I'm so grateful to you. What's the matter, dear? Why are you crying? You've cried all the tears you wanted whenever it suited you! You even stayed in bed throughout the funeral! I've been holding it together for so long! I've wanted to cry, too! Takeshi! You were everything to me! My dear. Takeshi! Oh, dear! You silly - Dear. I'm so sorry. You silly - I'm so sorry. SPRING, 1966 Here it comes. Come on. Don't cut in line. Get to the back of the line. We've all been waiting. - What do you want? - Stop that! Everyone's been waiting their turn! What're you doing? Please. You didn't have to - Thank you very much. Hey, boys. Come on over here. I've got some sweets. Oh, you needn't have. - Come on. Here. - Thank you. My husband loved them. He was a truly great father to them. How could such a thing happen to him? He was a quiet man. I never thought he'd confront such men. I just couldn't believe it. Who were the assailants? Members of a gang? They worked for the fire department. They'd been drinking. It?s just bad luck. I suppose I should give up. No. You've got that wrong. That's why I'm here. If you don't mind, may I ask how you make ends meet? I manage somehow, on welfare. I didn't get any worker's compensation. There was a little retirement benefit. I could go out and work, but I'm not in very good health. I heard you filed a suit for accident compensation. I was researching that, and I came across your case. A lawyer suggested it. Since they were government employees, I was told I could get state compensation. But it didn't work out. What did the court have to say? They said a lot of things I couldn't understand. About how my husband didn't have any authority in that instance. Basically, he wasn't directly affected when they cut into the line. There was no real need for him to stop them. What on earth? They just saw it as an ordinary fight. And if it's a fight, my husband shares the blame, too. That's absurd. No wonder people feel they're better off being apathetic. But it encourages violence. It's too late now. Even I wish that he had kept to himself. I wish he was apathetic, too. STABBED TO DEATH IN FIGHT TENRYU RIVER TENRYU GORGE Takeshi, I've embarked on a major quest. To create a world free of murder victims, we're going to get legislation that will help victims? families. This is my way of getting revenge. You watch me. I won't give up until it's done. What debt are you collecting, Mister? For the outboard motor? Or the chicken coop? Debt? You're here to collect, right? We have no money. If you want anything, go ahead and take it! I didn't come for that. It couldn't be anything good. Just remember one thing. My dad did nothing wrong, but he still got killed! That's right. I know all about it. Who are you talking to, Satoru? Hello. ELDERLY MAN LIVING ALONE SLAIN NOTE LEFT NEXT TO BODY AFTER TRAFFIC ACCIDENT SPRING, 1968 WOMAN SLAIN ON STREET - Hello. - Oh, come in. Nice day today. It feels good. I see you're busy as ever. Oh, is Uncle out again today? Today? He's been doing overnight trips lately. He's in Matsumoto today. Matsumoto? It's been a while since he's been to Shinshu. Spring in Shinshu must be nice. He was up before sunrise, and off he went. - This is the list of victims? - Yes. You put this together? A lot of names, aren't there? Over 100 now. And that's not even half. Is the victims' association going well? Well, he doesn't talk much when he gets home now. He just seems lost in thought. Some families even turn him away... like he was a peddler or something. That must be tough for Uncle. SHINSHU IIDA Mr. Kawase! Welcome! I've been waiting! Since I was in Matsumoto - - I was so happy to get your call. - I really wanted to see you. Thanks for coming. Now, come this way. Thank you. The mountains look the same as when I was a kid. My family all happen to be out today. Your mother and father, too? They've gone off to Suwa. Some business there. Then I'm glad the two of us have a chance to talk. Yes. I prefer it that way. I was a bit naive. We've all shared similar experiences, so I assumed they'd all get on board. After all, these sorts of tragedies can happen to anyone. I just don't understand it. There were some people who thought I was there to take advantage of them. They were very suspicious of me. They wouldn't even invite me in. I can imagine. I think that?s to be expected. You think? No one wants to dwell on dark feelings from a horrible tragedy like having a loved one killed. Rather than face up to it, they would rather erase it from their lives. To think of it as something from another world, and cast it away. I've felt that way, too. You, Kyoko? I was Takeshi's fiancee, after all. People are outwardly sympathetic to me, but behind my back they see me as a bad omen. I didn't realize. That's why I work at home making gift decorations. Isn't it ironic? Take a look at these. So you're not going to marry? I'm just not ready for that. But you need to move on. My wife's worried about you, too. You have to find a good man soon. What's the matter? I said that my father and mother went to Sawa. It wasn't because of business. They said they had no connection to you after the tragedy. It's all right. I can't blame them. That's why I said I was glad to have you to myself. I'm sorry. It's nothing for you to be sorry about. I'm determined to fight as hard as ever. Please sign! Please sign! Let's help the families of victims of violent crime. SHIBUYA STATION, TOKYO Please read this carefully. It's written very clearly. Please sign if you support us! Please read this carefully! Please sign! BEREAVED FAMILIES WILL NO LONGER SUFFER SILENTLY STATE COMPENSATION DEMANDED FOR FAMILIES OF CRIME VICTIMS We're gathering signatures for a petition to present to parliament. We want legislation that will help the families of crime victims. That's what this petition is for. Please sign the petition. Please sign. Here. Please. Please sign the petition. MARCH 1969 ?Opinion of the Ministry of Justice. For the families of murder victims we feel the utmost sympathy. The question of state responsibility to compensate such victims' involves many issues that require further study. The government must carefully study the need for legislation?. Is this all? That's right. That's all. ?They must carefully study the need -? In other words, they'll do nothing. It seems so, by the way they've written it. We've basically been shown the door. They're just saying they'll accept our opinion. That's right. It's a terrible way to treat people. It's been six months since we presented. They make us wait six months, and this is their answer. We were in the papers during the petition drive. Many people came up to me to say that there are all kinds of people facing hardships. That's what welfare is for. Why would only the surviving families of murder victims get - I've heard the same thing from many people. So the government is probably thinking along the same lines. It's not unreasonable. We thought it over for a whole month. There are big differences. This petition makes it clear, too. Take a traffic accident, say - You could be walking down the street and lose your life. But there's compensation for that. They might say it's because the driver is insured. But the point is there's a law for that. You think some crazy murderer can pay any compensation? That's why we're appealing to the state. The state is the only - I understand that. I've thought this through as well. But Mr. Nakazawa, I'm not giving up. I'm not one to back down after getting an answer like this. Of course. I'm not giving up either. I'll even go to Kyushu or Hokkaido. I'll get as many people as I can to join our association. Like you said at the start, there?s just no other way. We have to expand this campaign nationwide and appeal to the public. Mr. Nakazawa, I know you're a busy man, but can you do the rounds in the Tokyo area? Of course I can. But Madam - I've already prepared myself for this. He can go where he pleases, across the country or wherever. HIGH SCHOOL GIRL MURDERED ASSAULTED ON WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL ON THE BANKS OF THE GOHYAKU RIVER IN OMOTEYAZAWA, MOTOMIYA I'm amazed you quit smoking. You used to get all irritated and smoke at times like these. I didn't quit. I just forgot. It was from that day. You must be tired, saying things like that. Never mind me, I'm worried about you. Oh, I'm used to travelling. I worry about you. I'm glad I came with you. But I wonder if it's going to stay this packed all the way. It's been 10 years since we took a trip, and this is it. FUKUSHIMA CITY INN Is the washroom downstairs? Yes. At the bottom of the stairs. Oh, are you not able to see? No. That's not exactly right. Please turn off the lights in the hall when you don't need them. It's a waste of electricity, after all. Yes, indeed. You're right. Would you like dinner right way? Maybe we'll take a bath first. Oh, that might be nice. You must be tired. The bathhouse is very close. Go out onto the front street, and back toward the station, and around the second corner. I'll leave the clogs out in the foyer. The light switch for the hall is a string hanging down at the end. Let's not be wasteful. Yes. We understand. MOTOMIYA, ADACHI Her bicycle was found in this area. My daughter's body was found the following morning in the woods. She finished volleyball practice and left school at the usual time. It's dark at night, but there are houses nearby. I wasn't really worried. The assailant was waiting as though stalking his prey. A complete stranger. The way he tells it, he quickly strangled her - Anyway, you came at a good time. The 7th day services are over. I've finally come to accept that my daughter is dead. I was beginning to feel a great emptiness within me. If you'd come any earlier, I probably wouldn't have wanted to talk. Yes. It's like that with everyone. Yukie, is the doctor coming? No! He said to bring him in! In this rain? That's why he won't come! The doctor said that? He was just so blunt about it. All right. I'll go! But it's pouring out! Wait, dear! I'm coming, too! Hurry up, then! Hurry up! Stupid boy! A proper craftsman puts his body into it! You got that? FEMALE EMPLOYEE MURDERED ON WAY HOME AFTER WORKING OVERTIME NO EVIDENCE OF ROBBERY SETO INLAND SEA ?On the 21st, at about 4:00 p.m., while walking along a road in Marugame City, Nobuyuki Inoue, a 55-year-old fisherman from Rikunohama, Honjima, MAN BEATEN TO DEATH was shoved by a young man approaching him, who then proceeded to assault Inoue until he became unconscious. Inoue was taken to a clinic in Honjima for treatment but he never regained consciousness, and he died some two hours later?. Akeo! Where are you going? I'm going to kill him! Who are you going after? He was a police officer! I'll get someone else! Then they'll know how I feel! You'll be arrested if you do that! Hold it! Hold it! I don't care anymore! You mustn't! That boy was never like that. He quit working and he drinks all day. He keeps saying his father was a fool for getting killed. AUGUST 1974 KITAKYUSHU CITY On the 28th, at about 11:00 p.m., near the entrance to Takatoyama Park in Wakamatsu Ward, a man covered in blood and pleading for help was spotted by a resident of Hatsune, Tobata Ward: Kazuo Tsurumaki, a 28-year-old company executive. The man was taken to a hospital, but died shortly afterwards due to excessive bleeding. The victim was from Koishi, Wakamatsu Ward: Michio Sakuragi, a 46-year-old taxi driver. According to the police investigation, Sakuragi got into a quarrel with a young passenger he picked up in Minamae, and he was stabbed. Police are still looking for the assailant. CONDOLENCE OFFERING - KAWASE So you don't work? You just run around the country? That's right. I think of it as my work. How many families have you seen? Let's see. Maybe around 500. No. Probably around 600. You should run for office. You printed a small article during the petition drive, but nothing since then. Take a look at this. He's visited 586 families and we have 125 members now. It's a growing movement. I thought we'd see more after you got transferred to the Tokyo head office. A newspaper isn't a place where I can write whatever I want and they'll just publish it. I know that. But a newspaper does more than just report what goes on in the world. You also have a duty to make the world a better place. We're doing that. My uncle's over 60 now. And he's been at this for seven years. That's seven years of travelling! He'll go anywhere to meet a suffering family. He's not even thinking of himself. He's pouring everything into this. Is there no one at this paper who's moved by such dedication? And even though there are 125 members, they're scattered about and linked only through Shuzo Kawase. These people have never met and don't know each other's names. But that's to be expected. They don't meet and there's no published newsletter. They can't do it. They don't charge fees, after all. Lots of people can't even pay a 1000-yen annual fee. What can such an organization do? It'll end up being a meaningless group, and just disappear. That would be terrible for my uncle. And my aunt, too. You even once said that you were fond of him. I know. Yukie! This is terrible! Come here! What is it? The goldfish are dead! They were swimming so well until yesterday. Takeshi's disappointed. He's probably given up hope. Given up hope? Takeshi would be disappointed if that?s how you feel. That boy may be laughing at you. You're just exhausted. You've been doing a lot of travelling. You'll feel better if you rest a bit. I'm going to Osaka. What did you say? I'm going to Osaka. There's a new case there. I'll go home and get ready. But you just got back yesterday. It's all right. I don't have much time. Then I'll go with you. You know what can happen. It might be like that trip to Tohoku again. That's all right. I don't mind. By the way, do we have any money? I'll borrow it from my sister. It's the Tenryu River. Iida is upstream from here. I'll never forget those days. Remember when you took me to the graves? That was before Takeshi was born. You got back from work and insisted that we should go. Oh, there it is! These are my parents' graves. You mean these stones? The little one is my dad and the big one is my mom. Why is your dad's smaller? Well, he died earlier. I wasn't even in elementary school. My brother took me down to the Tenryu to pick up the stone. I said it was too heavy and we should drag it with a rope. My brother gave me hell for that. He said we couldn't do that with our dad?s gravestone. Then I suddenly felt like crying. That rock started to feel like Dad. I wondered why he had gotten so small. By the time my mother died I was finishing elementary school. So I was able to carry a bigger stone. But the real sadness was to come later. We three brothers ended up getting adopted separately. I was the middle one and stayed with my uncle in Iida. No one would tell me where my brothers went. I still don't know where they went. It was rough. I had to look after my cousins. The food I ate and even where I ate were different from them. That was because my parents died from illness. I despised my mother then. Why did she die and leave me? You can only be a parent if you're alive. Yukie. If we ever have kids, let's make sure that we live long for their sake. I'm counting on you. Our kids will never have to suffer like that. SHIN-OSAKA STATION It was mistaken identity. A man got into a quarrel in a bar and went home to get a shotgun. Then he hid and waited as my husband, a total stranger to him, came along. Now come this way. Here. Here. They caught the assailant and he's being tried. But that's all I've heard. We're the surviving victims of murder. Can you believe it? Can that be right? On top of that, a psychological assessment was done, and they said he had mental abnormalities. He might even be judged innocent. That's crazy. Why would someone like that have a shotgun? Who would've given him a permit? Don't you think? Come. I'm trying to carry on my husband's business, but it's hard. It sounds rough. Just raising my kids and seeing my husband's face every day was all I wanted. There was nothing more I wanted. I always felt that was enough. But I can't let this situation stand. I'm claiming damages from the national and prefectural governments. I didn't really want to at first. No amount of money would bring my husband back. It would've been like bartering my husband's life for money. What changed your mind? I began to think of it as a duty. A duty? It was like Professor Nakaya said. A victim's family has a natural right to compensation. Those people who can should demand it. There are people everywhere with a similar fate who are just grieving and doing nothing else. We have a duty to those people. Who is this Professor Nakaya? - Don't you know? - No. He teaches at Doshisha University in Kyoto. Last year he set up an association for a compensation system for crime victims. I didn't know there was anyone like that. I suppose a family member of his was a victim of crime? Actually, no. He teaches in the law department, and that's his research. He's even studied in England. And he says the victim's families have a right to compensation? That's right. He says some encouraging things. DOSHISHA UNIVERSITY I certainly am surprised. To think someone had been leading the way. If I'd known, I would've sought you out. So you have 150 people. No, it's 155. I see. Last fall I started a group with just four members. Even now, there are only 20 or 30. I tried to recruit many more, but they were all holed up in their homes. A lot of people told me to just leave them alone. So I can appreciate the trouble you've gone through. It must've been hard work. Yes. Indeed. Having taken it that far is no small task. You have my respect. I see. Now, to continue - As I mentioned, when protecting your rights and freedoms, it's unfortunately more difficult to prevent crimes. And we'll likely see more crimes as the world gets more complicated. These are times when you never know when tragedy will befall you. In fact, taking my group as an example, all of the victims were completely blameless. According to statistics from the year before, this was the case with over 30% of murders. So one-in-three murder victims were killed for no reason at all. As far as that goes, I believe such crimes are inherent in society. In a way, they're like endemic diseases. Endemic diseases? Diseases you cannot eradicate no matter what you do. I think you have to think of it that way. That's why I think we should be protected at all times through some insurance that pays under any circumstances. I think that?s the only way to deal with it. Did you say insurance? Yes. What do you mean? Not something you need to get a policy for. I believe all citizens are part of that contract. The premiums take the form of taxes. Of course, there are many obstacles. But the state ought to pay compensation to the victims. That's how I see it. I wish we had heard this earlier. We only wanted to help people who were suffering. It was about asking for help. Not at all. You've done splendidly. You've worked so hard for so long. You're to be commended. Please be confident. In Europe and the States, and even in Asia, laws have already been enacted to insure the people. There's no reason it can't happen in Japan. Let?s join together and work toward our objective. Thank you. You've given me the courage to continue. SHIN-YOKOHAMA STATION Slow down, dear. We have to hurry and tell everyone. Are you all right? I warned you! Are you all right? It's nothing serious. This way, dear. OPHTHALMOLOGY Glaucoma, huh? I'm glad he was straight with me. A good doctor. If there?s no cure, then that keeps it simple. We won't be bothered with going to the hospital. I'm resigned to this. But I won't give up on the campaign, with or without my eyes. Yukie. We're in a critical period right now. You'll have to take my hand and guide me. That's all right. I'll go with you everywhere. AUGUST 30, 1974 This afternoon in Marunouchi, Tokyo, in the lobby of the headquarters of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, a bomb planted by a young man went off Six people were killed, including pedestrians and office workers on break. Over 100 people suffered serious injuries in this major disaster. The police agency and Marunouchi precinct are considering it a planned assault, on the basis of a bomb warning phoned into the office by a young man, and the fact that bomb fragments found at the scene suggest a timer device. It is thought to be the work of radicals as police start to pursue this case. The explosion occurred just at the end of the lunch break when office workers were returning to their offices. Many took the brunt of the explosion and fell to the ground, and this street in Marunouchi was instantly turned into a scene from hell. Let's visit them all. Take me! Yes. We should go. SHUZO KAWASE ASSOCIATION TO PROMOTE A SYSTEM OF COMPENSATION FOR CRIME VICTIMS DEMANDING COMPENSATION FOR CRIME VICTIMS BORN IN NAGANO, 1912 OWNER OF METALWORKS IN TSURUMI, YOKOHAMA ONLY SON MURDERED IN 1966 You don't like it? It's only because a big company was hit and a lot of people died. That's what it takes to get people to notice. That's exactly right. So what? It makes me angry. You sure took your time. Now that it's a big deal you don't look the other way. - Don't be so petty. - Who's being petty? This is how the world has always been. He certainly knows that. He may have his doubts, but he doesn't show it. He wants to use this opportunity to make an impact. That's all. He's doing all he can in spite of his condition. I know that much. FEBRUARY 1975 CRIME VICTIM COMPENSATION SYSTEM Please file in from the top. Good morning. Please come this way. Thank you for coming. Watch your footing. Be careful. Mr. Suzuki - Good morning. Over this way. Please. Are you all right? Right here, Madam. - Thank you. - Please sit down. These are the Kawases. Please have a seat, Madam. Mr. Kawase, this segment will be about 12 to 13 minutes. Only 12 to 13 minutes? We have other segments as well. - Yes, I understand. - Thank you. I have some arrangements to make. Please make yourself comfortable. We're not the only ones here. I know. I'll just keep it concise. STATE COMPENSATION DEMANDED FOR FAMILIES OF CRIME VICTIMS BEREAVED FAMILIES WILL NO LONGER SUFFER SILENTLY KANTO KOSHINETSU ASSOCIATION POSSIBLE LEGISLATION TO OFFER COMPENSATION FOR CRIME VICTIMS MINISTER OF JUSTICE ANNOUNCES JULY 2, 1976 Are we near the Diet Building? We're just at the back of it. The entrance is right here. Finally... Pardon? Finally, we plunge into the den of lions. It really feels like that. It's been a long road. And we've finally arrived. Careful. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL AFFAIRS With respect to this legislation, the most difficult challenge is how to deal with the victims of past crimes. If this law is only intended to help people that are victims of crime committed in the future, we will not have addressed the many problems faced by those people. To express his views on this point I would like to call upon Mr. Shuzo Kawase, who has continued to lead this campaign. Mr. Shuzo Kawase. Yes. After hearing what the honourable members have said - I don't really understand some of the complicated issues. But as the honourable member has said, I have continued to pursue this campaign for eight years. I don't know how to put this, but it's been a worthwhile effort. For example, when I visited the home of a victim, just as I offered some incense, the young widow held a wooden mortuary tablet tightly to her chest and said, ?Why did you die, dear? Why did you die at the young age of 30? Because you were killed, there's no money coming in at all. If you had died in a car accident or a workplace accident, I would've been able to receive some money. I would've been able to support our child for two or three years. I could've raised him properly until he was old enough. But because you were murdered I get no money from anywhere. What am I supposed to do now?? When I heard her anguished pleas, I became determined to push for a compensation system to be enacted into law as soon as possible. I have been working towards that aim even as my eyesight has deteriorated. I was practically away from home for six years. I visited the families of victims across the country. In some cases, they thought I just wanted money and they would turn me away at the door. I've had many experiences, and have met all kinds of people. I've seen a lot of families suffering. And so it is my desire that a system like this be adopted as soon as possible. And I understand that ordinary legislation is not retroactive as a general rule. But my wish is that this law apply to cases going back 10 or 15 years, so that long-suffering families can get the help they need. You must be exhausted. Yeah. What a nerve-racking experience. You did great. A simple metal shop owner who doesn't have a way with words, finds the words come rambling out. Don't worry about that. They didn't call on you to talk about law like the professor. Is something the matter, dear? I'm fine. Dear? Dear! JANUARY 1977 ?In order to consider retroactive legislation, various budgetary obstacles can be expected. But public opinion in favour of enacting the law is mounting, as it is clearly aimed at people who have suffered from crimes. A campaign started by a small band of citizens has grown in scope, proving significant in the continual development of democracy?. Are you listening? I am listening. Anyway, there you go. They're seriously considering the issue of making it retroactive. Isn't that what it says? There's more. Shall I keep reading? Read me all of it. Let's see. Where was it? It's all over the place now. It's like everyone wants to write about it now. Come on. Just read it. I'm just looking for it. Here. Here it is. ?The Price of Life - On the value of victim compensation? The price of life, huh? He's weakened considerably since appearing before the committee. But he still insists on attending the meetings. Stubborn as he is, he's starting to take my advice. This is the same hospital your son was brought to. That's right. The same hospital. He said this is where he wanted to be. I guess it's been 10 years. Where were you, Auntie? Hurry! Hurry! Yukie - Yes. What is it? Get ready. Get ready for what? We're going out. Where are you going, Uncle? Coca Cola. The one that died because... there was cyanide in it. Who would do such a thing? Killing an innocent person. Is there a doctor? Yes. Right here. I have a request. Two more years. Why? Why? For just two more years - Why two years? Please let me live. You'll be all right. Not to worry. In two years - I think in two years... they'll enact a law. I can't go see my son... until I witness that. I'm begging you. Two more years. Doctor! No! No! What're we going to do, Mr. Matsuzaki? How can fate be so cruel to my aunt and uncle? I'll phone the paper. I will do it. I will carry on the work that you wanted to finish. Mr. Kawase just passed away. Mr. Kawase of the campaign to get compensation for crime victims. Yes. His heart gave out from overwork. ?A Great Citizen Passes On?. That's the story. I'll send it in 10 minutes. The lead for the evening edition. I know it's tight, but I'll make it in time. Thanks. Mr. Matsuzaki, you must know - What? The murderer that killed Takeshi is already out and walking freely amongst us. Probably. Not probably. It's certain. At least five years but no more than 10. Even if he got the maximum, he'd already be out in the world. What's 10 years? Does that allow him to wash away his crime and start over? Uncle - I can't imagine how hard Uncle worked over these past 10 years. Even with his eyesight gone, he'd be walking about. And now he's finally dead. What did he get for that effort? No money left, and no one to turn to. In the end, my aunt just gets left behind. How do their 10 years compare with the murderer's 10 years? I understand how you feel. It's not about how I feel. It's about how my aunt and uncle feel. It's about how victims across the country feel. In June of 1979, the government drafted a bill to pay compensation up to a maximum of 8.6 million yen. However, this draft bill did not have provisions for retroactivity and has yet to be introduced in parliament.
