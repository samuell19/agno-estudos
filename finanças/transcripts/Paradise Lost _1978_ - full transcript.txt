TWENTY YEARS LATER There. There. That one is always the worst. What a lot of dust. It's a waste of time. Don't know why he wants all these animals in the house. You can't do anything with them. They're just a waste of space. But this one's pretty. I do like this one. Right. What a waste of time. Did it used to be like this? - What d'you mean? Adeline says it used to be much nicer here. And bigger. A real paradise. - It may have been. But there were a lot less birds. People used to hunt a lot here. Like in the photo of your father with the king? That wasn't the king, Peter, that was the Prince Regent. Adeline has been pulling your leg again. Sir's father too. But your father was a minister, wasn't he, Your Worship? Yes, he was. Now sir's father is clean again. But he wasn't for long. - Why? It's an old story. And you? Are you going to be a minister? - I don't think so. I'd rather stay here at Olmenhof, with my birds. With our birds. Adeline thinks it's terrible, how you've let it fall into disrepair. Let her. I think it's nicer like that. Dad says you can't afford to maintain it. Your dad only thinks of money. - True. I know why you've let it all fall into disrepair. Do you? Why? - Because of the birds. So that they can carry on living here. - That's not the only reason. Isn't it? So why? Tell me, Your Worship. Why? Look through the lens. If you can tell me what it is, I'll give you 20 francs. Well, what is it? - The top of a red stick. What? Do I get 20 francs? What are you doing here? - Well, we're working here and... Hey, you're not allowed to do that. - Aren't I? Just watch me. Hey, what's going on here? - I should ask you that, Mr... Jozef Roelofs, surveyor with the Ministry of Public Works. Benjamin Rolus, mayor of Hamelen, owner of this estate. Right Mr Jozef Roelofs, tell me. We're marking out a new motorway. Yes, the E32. Transont, Hamelen, Pullendonk. Didn't you know? Yes, but not that it'd go through my estate. See for yourself. But Your Worship, if that road is built here, the birds will have to leave. Don't worry, that road won't be built here. Jozef Roelofs, surveyor with the Ministry... minister. But minister, our engineer personally... Of course, minister, an engineer can make mistakes but... Yes, I understand. Yes, right away. I'll put him back on. Goodbye, minister. That was the minister. Hello? Yes, I thought so. It was only to make things perfectly clear. Have you got a moment? - Put your arm in. Sorry, I hope this mistake is an end to the matter. Of course I don't doubt my late father's best friend. Yes, but you must understand that in the circumstances... The road won't go through here, eh? - Of course not. If it's not built here, where will it be built? Goodbye. Right, Peter, we sorted that out, didn't we? Right, come on. Quickly. Peter, say goodbye to the mayor. I don't mind if he stays a bit longer. But you've still got to go over the papers for the council meeting. Peter will only get in the way. Peter has to do what Adeline says and so do I. But he can come back, can't he? That's because you've been such a good boy. Well, what do you say? - Thank you. Thank you very much, Your Worship. Thank you very much, Your Worship. - Right, come on. Quickly. You won't let that road be built and the birds leave, will you, Your Worship? I've already told you that. Go on. And next time, come in through the kitchen. Or I'll have to clean the hall all over again. God, it is such a shame, that poor motherless child. And a father like that. Come on, Adeline. If Peter's not allowed to play here neither are you. If I were you, I'd be careful what I say in his hearing. Now that his father, Jan Boel, also wants to become mayor. Tuur. Tuur. Here. Cauwberghs' bill. Remember, no payment, no delivery. Bbbbbbbut boss, CCCCauwberghs has got problems. Problems, problems. You're my problem. No payment, no delivery. I'm not going to let my business be destroyed by a load of spongers. Hurry up, it's half past five. I've got to go to the council meeting. It's not because you stutter that you have make my truck do it too. No one has any respect for someone else's property anymore. Come here, you. Come here. Hurry up. Come on. Where have you been all day? Come here. I can see. With that Rolus at Olmenhof. Why don't you go and play with Roos van Tienen or Melchior? At least when it comes to the crunch, they'll be voting for me and not Rolus. Or don't you want your father to be mayor? What d'you get up to there? - It's none of your business. Sir has learnt good manners... - That's my bird. That's my bird. That's all you think about, birds. You should do something useful during your holiday. Something you can earn money from. That's all you think about, money. - What? That's what feeds you, Boel Seeds and Corn. That Rolus of yours is up to his eyes in debt. And the arrogance of the man. The Roluses have always been mayor without having to do a thing. Just because they live on that estate and have connections. But times have changed. The mayor's father was a minister and he knew the king. Mine wasn't and didn't, I know. He was just a poor potato farmer But at least he had clean hands, even if they were covered in earth. But he died a good Christian, in his bed. What your friend hasn't told you is that that minister had to resign because of the scandal at the bank and that he hung himself. Rolus thinks that people have forgotten that after 10 years, but they haven't. People don't forget if you remind them in time. I'll tell you something. When the new road is built, through the estate, the estate won't be worth a quarter of what it is now. And then that peasant Boel will put his hand up. His golden hand. What about that? The son of a potato farmer, master of Olmenhof. They chased me out of paradise in my birthday suit, but I shall walk back in through the front door in my best suit. Of that I'm certain. And once that road is built there... - That road won't be built there. What do you know about it? Go on, tell me, you little sod, or I'll pull your arms out of your body. That road'll never be built there. - I'll get you later, you little sod. Hello. Boel Seeds and Corn. Minister. Yes, of course, minister. That new road is a fantastic initiative. Certainly now it's going through Olmenhof. What d'you mean? Not through Olmenhof. Where then? Through the village? Bloody hell, the little sod was right. No, nothing, minister. We'll soon do something about that. What d'you mean? No trouble? But how do you want? Right, minister. No trouble. Yes, of course, shan't say a word, minister. Not a word. Yes. Thanks. Yes, of course, this evening at the council meeting. I'd like to know where the road is going to be built. At the moment no one knows. Some know where it won't be built. - Who d'you mean? You're late. - I had to go and see Mother. I had to go and see Mother. Ask your connections in Brussels. - I'm sure you'll tell us. I certainly will. Sorry, but I had to go somewhere... - It's OK. Here. Here is where the new motorway is planned. Here and here. Here is your estate, Your Worship. The road should be built along here. And where do you want it to be built? You want it to be built here and here. Through the village, through Kerkhofstraat. But that's where Mother lives. - Not just your mother, Marie-Louise. Thirty less well-off members of the community live there. You are exaggerating, as usual. It's only 21 people. So that makes it alright to mess them around? What about respect for the dead? Because if that road's built there, the graveyard will have to go. If that happens... - It's not allowed to happen. Because then I'll lose my best field. - I hadn't thought of that. If it does happen, Mr Schellekens, the council will compensate you. What good is that to me? - And we'll build a new graveyard. And who'll pay for that? - Those who live in the street will be given new houses that are more modern than the hovels they live in now. But Your Worship, moving house! Mother would never survive that. It won't happen. That new road won't be built there. It'll be built here. And nowhere else. Be more careful with council property. It's not yours yet. You're good with words, but you're sacrificing agricultural land, houses, not to mention the dead, just to protect your own property. Well said, Boel. Does the last little area of natural beauty have to be sacrificed? No, never. - What did you say? As chairman of the green committee, I say we'll never give way to concrete, stinking exhaust fumes, the roaring of lorries. We're not in the classroom. - Let him speak, Mr Boel. Comrades, what does maths, and in particular Euclidean geometry, teach us about the shortest distance between two points? That the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. And what do we see? - A bastard. That the planned motorway makes a very strange bend round Hamelen. This is straight, from here to here. Like that. So the road doesn't have to go past Hamelen. Who knows what is behind it? Nothing, Mr De Cat, except for the gifted few who see the black hand of capitalism everywhere. - You don't have to be gifted for that. As a teacher you know everything about geometry, but as a new councillor very little about our problems. Enough to know that something funny is going on. Or is it coincidence that the real estate company Comextra has bought land along the route of the motorway, exactly along that strange bend? Even Mr Boel admits that this motorway is good for our village. That's right, use me for your election propaganda. But you do admit that. - I admit it, Your Worship. You've done alright, thanks to your connections that are helping you to protect your estate. According to the rumours. - Rumours are always exaggerated. If I'm correctly informed, you want to become mayor. I pity our village if, as mayor, you allow yourself to be guided by rumours. That's got nothing to do with it. - Maybe not. But as would-be mayor you'd do better to listen to the younger generation. Mr De Cat was right. - There you go. Certain decisions are made without us. Like deciding on the route of the new motorway. We haven't any say in that. - But we can do something about that. Go on then, Mr Boel. - Well done. Go on then. Recently your impetuosity has become legendary in the village. Boel. Your Worship! He's been too clever for you again. - Maybe, but he won't succeed this time. Won't he? - I've got connections too. Which one? The blond or the redhead? - You should watch your mouth. So should you. I've had enough of your progressive twaddle. Euclidian geometry... I was elected by people who want me to defend their interests. Think instead of the interests of your four children and the fifth on its way. Yes, get in. Goodnight. - What d'you mean? Tell him, Sus. He means you're still waiting for your permanent appointment and he can do something about that. In Duren or in Daldorcht. That's blackmail. - No, that's politics, you sad git. Yes, politics. - Sus doesn't say anything. Because he's got two pieces of land, one good, one bad. If the road comes through Kerkhofstraat, he'll lose his good piece. But he'll get the same money for both. - Why are you telling him that? Otherwise he won't understand. Now d'you understand why he wants the road to go through Olmenhof? Godfried, we've got to go home, Godfried. You and your piece of land, you and your mayor's chain of office. Parasites! Those who don't make the most of the situation are idiots. You can choose. Go along with us or be even more stupid than you are already. That's that sorted. - That I've gotta see. If my connections say the road won't be built through Kerkhofstraat, it won't be. Bloody hell. Boel. Jan Boel. Hey! You should be ashamed. Throwing poor people out of their house like that. We're only doing our job. If you didn't do your job, we wouldn't have to leave our house. I've lived there all my life. Someone else would only do it. - No one's doing anything here. That road won't be built here. That's government property. Who's going to pay for it? Here, go and have a beer. Take this to Jan Boel and tell him to pay for it. What? 3,500 francs? Are you mad? I'm only doing what they tell me. - This isn't the end of the matter. Bloody hell. I'll be glad when I retire. Imagine if he were to be elected mayor. What d'you mean, the minister is in a meeting? You told him it's Jan Boel? Well, miss, tell him again. Yes, I've got plenty of time. 3,500 francs! Minister... What? Who are you then? Secretary. Well, I wanted to say... You already know. Right, then I wanted to ask the minister what I should do. Certainly not make trouble? But... The broken pole? That was an accident. The minister doesn't like that kind of accident? Yes, of course. Yes, I understand I can't just bother the minister like that. Of course I'll find a solution myself. Yes, that's what I'll do. Find a solution myself... Can't you see I'm thinking? - But bbbboss, I... I've just come to ask if you're going to BBBBBrussels this week? You just think that I... - Bbbbbut boss, I... Yes, fine. Go on. - Bbbbut boss... Don't stand there like an idiot! Go on! Yes, it's me. Your Excellency, I'd like to thank you for your quick intervention in connection with the motorway planned past Hamelen. But certain things make me fear for the future of Olmenhof. On your advice I agreed at the time that that road would come this way. You made me realise it would be good for the prosperity of our village. And also that certain revelations about my father's death could be kept out of the newspaper of which you happen to be a director. I wouldn't dream of connecting the two. That would be in very poor taste. Nor do I want to refer to the recent purchase of land round Hamelen by the Comextra company, with which you are not unfamiliar. There's no point in raking all that up, especially not between us. I only wish to emphasise the fact that I will do everything I can to oppose any desecration of Olmenhof. I'm prepared to go to almost any lengths to protect the name of the Rolus family. But I don't fancy it being buried under a layer of concrete. I hope you will understand my point of view and that I... Good evening, Adeline. You. I forbid it. You can't come in. No. Sir. Sir. Don't bother, Adeline. Hello, Benjamin. Do you recognise me? Or don't you dare recognise me? Pascale. Yes. Pascale. Sorry. If I'd known it was going to be such a shock for you, I'd have arrived in pieces. Which piece should I have sent first? Don't you wonder what your dear cousin is doing here after all this time? That's good. That would be a real shock and God knows how you'd react then. You Roluses have always been so high-spirited. Benjamin, I... OK, OK. Don't say anything. I'm leaving. But you can spare a glass of water, can't you? Just a sip. Then I'll go. Just a sip. It's so nice to have family. Not a drop for that slut. Your father would've shown her the door by now. I don't doubt that for a minute. It's a trick, sir. Leave me alone! No! Flames of passion ignited inside him, burning so fiercely that they could only be extinguished by complete surrender to the wicked game of the sensual she-devil. And thus spun Pascale, that filthy slut, her web for a simple farmer's son, Jan Boel. What's the point, Pascale? It's so long ago. You're throwing me out because of it. - You're here now. Because I twisted my ankle. If you've come to rake up the past... I'll be thrown straight out. That's not the only reason I came. Why else then? - You wouldn't believe me. Is it so unlikely? - To you, probably. You can always try. - Alright. After that affair with young Boel, I was sent to a convent boarding school. Probably to improve my life. It worked really well. I ended up at Leuven university, but academic life didn't interest me in the slightest and I left. Money immediately stopped being sent, so I had to get a job. Air hostess, assistant radiologist, photographic model, script girl, model in Amsterdam. All glamorous jobs, so not beneath the dignity of the sibylline partygoer from a dying line. At the end I even considered suicide. - No. Unhappy in love? No, that only happens once. No, I felt like I'd come to a dead end. And now I'm looking for where the thread broke. You think you'll find that here? - I thought so. Yes, very funny. You're right, it sounds unlikely. - You're the best one to judge. You're living in a crumbling ruin with a worn-out housekeeper and your stuffed birds. Of course you know all about people. Enough to keep them at a distance. Which is why you haven't got a wife or a mistress. Is it that so obvious? I don't even need to avail myself of my female intuition for that. You may be right, but life isn't only about... Fucking. Don't look so shocked. That's what they call it in the big wide world. That's not the only thing in life, but it is the most important. It's the only thing left. I've got other priorities. - Such as? Choosing the right wine, for example. A Margot '69 or a Saint-Estéphe '73? The Saint-Estéphe. That's not a priority, it's a compensation. Call it what you like, but I've found a sort of balance among my dusty books and stuffed birds. Something I won't allow anyone or anything to upset. Don't worry. I'm not staying. - I don't mind if you stay for a while. How sweet of you. - I mean, until your foot is better. Your hospitality know no bounds. - You won't get in anyone's way. Certainly not with this foot. Where does it hurt? Here. No, here. What's the matter? You used to kiss the bit that hurt and it stopped hurting immediately. That was a long time ago. - You could always try it again. If it works, I'll be off tomorrow. Or would you rather I stayed? Adeline, you don't know what you've done. I came to ask if sir needs me anymore. No, it's fine, Adeline. You can get the spare room ready. Miss Pascale is staying for a few days. Because of her foot. - God. How innocent. I'm not wanted here. - You know what she's like. I don't care what your housekeeper thinks. I was talking about you. You still believe the fairy tale about what happened in the summer house. I saw it myself. - And that makes it true? Hasn't it ever occurred to you that young Boel jumped me? You men are all the same, it's always the woman's fault. I wish I could believe you. - Then listen. I was young and in love with you. Yes, you. But you didn't even know I existed. I used an inexperienced girl's trick to make you jealous. The things I tried, to ensure that you heard about those dates with young Boel. But sir either had his head in his books or was spying on birds. Even then. On one of those dates, Boel forced himself on me, just when you did come. I wish I could believe you. See what those connections of yours are worth. I can't trouble the people in Brussels because they're erecting a few poles. No, only when the road's been built. - That road won't be built here. Those surveyors aren't there, either. - That doesn't mean a thing. Just like those connections of yours. Well, we won't carry on doing nothing. Just so that you know. So what d'you want to do, teacher? - Maybe he's got an idea for once. I certainly have got an idea. Village guerrilla. Village guerrilla! You're not in a city. I've got a better remedy. Better remedy! I've got a secret weapon that'll be more effective than your village guerrilla. Seeing is believing! A remedy for corns! That Boel and his remedies... - Corns. Sus. - Boel. Nicer than in the city, even without salt. Yes, it's got more taste. The eggs aren't like they used to be. - Look, one of Adeline's hairs. Yes. No, they aren't like they used to be. Here. No, no more. It makes me edgy. No, not for me. They make me cough. Not a single vice. Never mind, I've got enough for us both. Who is that lady? - Mr Benjamin's cousin. She's very beautiful. - She's very deceitful. I'd forgotten how peaceful it can be here. You'd probably get bored after a week. - Probably. You used to be very good at amusing yourself. The past is past, Benjamin. - Not for me. I remember everything about that last summer. I'm sure you can. - It's not what you think. What then? Your books, your birds or your dried plants? The colour of your dress. A blue muslin dress with a yellow butterfly. The day I picked those wild purple flowers for you, I said... That women used to use them to make a love potion. You still remember. - As if it were yesterday. We were in the summer house. It was very hot. I felt intoxicated by the scent of those flowers. You just sat there. You didn't say anything. I wanted to touch you. But you didn't. No. You were too beautiful. The next day I made that date with Boel. Well? What do you think of me now? You're even more beautiful. - But you still won't touch me. There's nothing for you to see here. It's not that. - So why? Because cousins shouldn't fall for each other? I'm not that old-fashioned. Then you're still trapped in your past. Freudian paternal relations etc. - No. It's nothing to be ashamed of. I, for example, am still trapped in my first love. Who do you mean? That, my dear Benjamin, you can work out for yourself. Incidentally, is there still water in the pond? Yes, why? - I want to go and cool down, before your manly presence totally overwhelms me. Are you coming? - Later maybe. I haven't got a swimming costume. - I'll whistle when I'm approaching. Then you can hide in amongst the reeds. - You rogue. How's your foot? One day! One day and you're in her clutches. A sip of water, then I'll go. She's planning on drinking the whole pond, no doubt. Adeline. Adeline. Benjamin? Come out, Benjamin. I've seen you. I won't bite. Who are you? Peter Boel, miss. - Well, Peter Boel. Give me my clothes back. - I haven't got them. Don't be silly. Give them back. - I haven't got your clothes. If you don't give them back, I'll get out of the water like this. You wouldn't dare. - You don't know me. Give me my clothes back, or... - I haven't got your clothes. I'll get out... This is where I lost you. This is where you find me again. What's the matter? What's the matter? I... I can't. You can't? You don't want to! Bloody hypocrite. Pascale, I... - Don't touch me. Your Worship, Adeline sent me. The constable phoned. There's trouble in Kerkhofstraat. Go on, why are you standing there? Go on. At least do your duty, if you can't... It's best that you leave too. Tomorrow. No road here! No... no... no... no road... no... no... - Leave that pole alone. I say... - Leave that pole alone. Then you should leave those houses alone. No road here! Never, never, never. - No road here! No road here. Never, never. Come on, Marie-Louise. No road... What? The mayor! ...here! Everyone, I know that you don't want that road here. But it's a decision we can't change. You may be able to stop it today, but the police will come tomorrow. Is that what you want? Go on home, before someone gets hurt. Go on home. Go on, go home. Stay where you are. - Come on. Go on. - Stay where you are. Go on. There, you can get back to work. - I don't trust it, Your Worship. Charel, you know our people. Exactly. I'd rather have had the police here tomorrow. It won't come to that. - You never know. If you need me, I'm in the town hall. - Right, Your Worship. Village guerrilla, they're too clever for that. Too stupid, you mean. They haven't heard the last of this. - Have you got another idea? A strategic diversionary tactic. Zulma! - Mother! What have you done? You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs. You did that on purpose. Look what that dickhead has done. Throwing old people to the ground. No road here! No road here! Attack! No... no... no... no road here! No road here! Tuur! Tuur! Tuur! Tuur! Blast you, where are you? Tuur? What are you doing here? - I need to talk to you. Can't we do this in the summer house, as usual? So what's the matter? It's not working. - What d'you mean? It must. He suddenly didn't want to any more. Madam can give the whole of Brussels a hard-on but when it really matters... Please. - Make him want to. That's what you do for a living. What've you been doing for the past 10 years? We weren't going to talk about that. - Well we are. What did you promise me when I took you out of that brothel 5 years ago? When I set you up in that chic apartment in Brussels? That I'd do anything for you. - And why? Because I... - Because you need that. You've always needed that, right from the first time we fucked. And, 15 years later, when the farm-hand had worked his way up and could afford the most exclusive brothel in Brussels, he met that upper-class madam again. She'd become an upper-class whore. She let him know she needed it even more than she used to. Admit it, Pascale. Admit that you still need it. That there's nothing better in the world and that you'll do anything I want. No, Pascale, first you have to do your work. And once you've twisted him round your little finger and have asked him to sell everything so that the road goes through Olmenhof, then you'll get your reward from Jan. Please, Jan. Now. Alright, seeing as it's you. Jan... Jan. Jan. Next time, bring better news. Well, what happened? - The... Village guerrilla. Well? Don't you like it? - Yes. I thought my food wasn't good enough anymore either. Eat your soup, before your meat gets cold. Go on. I've had enough. Adeline. Isn't Miss Pascale going to have anything to eat? How should I know? I don't have anything to do with her. She went for a walk and then shut herself in her room. D'you know what they're saying in the village? That her upstairs doesn't live in Amsterdam but in Brussels. And d'you know what she does there? - Yes. What? - She's a model. Right, a model. - It's just a job like any other. In a window? Not in a window. Next to a telephone. They call them call girls. I'm only saying what I've heard. You mustn't believe everything you hear. - You're a fine one to speak. She's leaving tomorrow. - Really? Have you told her already? - Yes. That's the first sensible thing you've said since she's been here. Go on. I've had enough. - Eat some more meat. I've got something you'll like. One of your favourites. Chocolate soufflé. Good evening, Adeline. Hello, Benjamin. I'll lay the table for madam. To make it nice and cosy. After all, it's your last evening here. We haven't got any candles. We're not used to people of your class. D'you really mean I have to leave? D'you mean I'm a hypocrite? I never mean what I say. - I do. That's the difference. God, I'd almost forgotten. The righteous Roluses. Sorry. I had no right to say that. I'm a bit flustered this evening. The table is set, madam. Enjoy your meal. At a farewell party, there should be a farewell toast. To a failed attempt. It wasn't your fault. No. But I've been wasting my time here. Don't we all do that? I've been wasting my time for twenty years. I've buried myself here for twenty years, for twenty years I've tried to take refuge in my work. For twenty years I've lied to myself. Not a day has passed that I didn't think about you. Which is why I never left here. I thought I could shut myself up here with my thoughts of you. Like I remembered you, unchanged. Pure. Even though I let everything fall into disrepair, you always remained... intact. There's never been any other woman in my life. My whole life I've tried to argue away my feelings for you. I couldn't. Doesn't she want any dessert? - I'll have it. What's the matter? Why did you run away? Please, leave me alone. - First tell me what's the matter. I'm bad. If only you knew how bad... Why do you say that? If only I could tell you. - Why don't you try? Benjamin, if I'd known before that you still loved me... Isn't that a reason to... - No. If you really love me, leave now. Why? There's something I have to put right. What? - It's not important. Why don't you tell me then? - It's my business. Well, if it's your business, then you sort it out. There! What d'you think? - Not bad, but... But what? - Those two balls. Eh, Marie-Louise? The advertising people weren't sure about that either. But I didn't give in. Why two balls? - It's simple. You went to college. You must know. To be symmetrical? Whatever that means, no, not that. Tuur, you must know. Yyyyyes, but I dddddon't dare say. Come on. How many hands did the Lord give us? Two. How many eyes? Two. How many ears? Two. My business, seed and corn. How many sexes? - Two sexes. That's his secret weapon. Hey, Marie-Louise... Idiot. What's it like in politics, wherever you go? Left and right, conservative and progressive, good and bad. But here, everyone stands side by side, left and right, young and old, rich and poor, everything together in one big people's party. Jan Boel, the police are here, damn it. POLICE Naughty man. Go on, Zulma, you tell him. Good day, gentlemen. Do I really have to leave my house? - That's far from certain, Zulma. But they're working there. You can't just transplant people. Leaving will kill me. Do you really think your estate is more important than all the people here? The estate is important for everyone. - No, just for you. Because no one is allowed on it. It's true what Boel says. You just think of us as animals. Your late father would turn in his grave if he knew. At least your father was a mayor who meant well. He didn't only think of himself. Where's Pascale? - The whore is packing. Pascale, don't leave. - It was only a game. Like everything I do. - Not for me and not for you either. Or was it? - I told you, I'm bad. Bad through and through. Even if it were true, I wouldn't care anymore. Even if Adeline were right? Even if I'd done something awful? Or was going to do it? - Why do you torture yourself? Pascale. Pascale. Peter. Let's do it again. I've got 20 years to make up for. - You're getting there. Let's do it slowly this time. - You learn quickly. Now I know what I've been missing all that time. Now I know what I should've done all those years. Give up everything here. I'll give the estate to the village. Then they can build ten roads through it. I'll go out into the big wide world with you, as they say. God, no. Why not? Don't you want to see the big wide world? Not like that. No, now I want to. I also know what is more important than my books, my trees and my birds. Traitor. Traitor. Adeline. Why did you do that? That way the child learns about life. What are you doing? Have you finally come to your senses? The mayor. - What's the matter with him? He's betrayed the birds. - Betrayed them? He's letting that stinking road be built through his estate. Great. That means I'll be able to buy Olmenhof. And become mayor. Bloody hell, lad, just imagine. Your father, the personal friend of an official of state and who knows, maybe a minister himself one day. Anything can happen in this country. Wait till I tell the minister. I don't care! What is my own flesh and blood saying? - I'm not. The whole village says I'm not your child. Look at yourself and look at me. That's what you get for being nice to a child! You understood correctly, Your Excellency. I'll tell the council. I thought this was the most elegant solution. Also for your friends from Comextra. No, I no longer need your support, Your Excellency. What did you say? Yes, I'm selling everything. Yes, the entire estate. No, no need for thanks. I did it for myself. Goodnight, Your Excellency. BRUSSELS One, two, one, two, one, two. Come on, move. Come on. I'm here to see the minister. Jan Boel. I told you on the phone that the minister was in a meeting. All day? - Yes. Did you tell him it was me? Jan Boel, Boel Seeds and Corn. Of course. Well? He said he was in a meeting all day. Well, I'll wait for him all day. You've got nerve. Really? - I've been waiting here for a month. But not for much longer. I've got a recommendation from someone high up with Comextra. You know... Comextra. The firm the minister also works for. Yes, I know. Hello. Well I never, it's you! What? Never! You don't have to do that. Yes, of course. We'll do that then. See you tomorrow. Yes. Miss, is this game going to last much longer? But Mr Boel, that's the minister. Minister. Minister, I need to talk to you urgently. It's OK. I'm Jan Boel. Boel Seeds and Corn. Jean-Marie, see what we can do for this man. It's OK, minister. It's OK. Can you tell the minister that it's OK? It's... Sir, it's OK. It's OK. Sir... But, it... Bloody hell, they conned me. The minister and his friends already know that Rolus is selling his estate. Now they don't need me any more, they've dropped me like a hot potato. Well, I'll show them. I made it possible for that road to go through Olmenhof. Now I'll make it go round it again. What are you doing here? - I've come to help you. Haven't you done enough damage? - Maybe we can do something about that. Yes, Adeline, what do you want? - I want... I'd like to talk to madam. - Haven't you said enough? Exactly. I'd like to ask for forgiveness. Listen, Adeline... I know everything. You whore. Boel is waiting for you in the summer house. Jan? Jan? Let me past. You've got what you wanted. - No, you slut. No, let me go, you bastard. - No Pascale, I won't let you go. Pascale? Adeline? What are you doing here? Where's Pascale? I'll show you. No, Pascale. A bit longer. You used not to be able to get enough and now you don't want to anymore. You make me want to puke. Benjamin, help me. Help me. - Your Worship. Now you can see for yourself. She's mine and always will be. It's not true, Benjamin. Don't believe him. Take a good look. She only slept with you so that the road would go through the estate and she did that for me. Don't believe him. It's not true. You animal. Benjamin, help me. - She's crazy about me. Crazy, crazy, crazy. - Help. You won't let that road be built through Olmenhof now, eh? Bye, Adeline. Benjamin, don't look at me like that. I can explain. Don't let him destroy everything. Come with me, Benjamin. Come on. No! Benjamin, I can explain. Please. Please. Please. Come on, Benjamin. You can't stay outside in weather like this. I've always protected you, eh lad? Because I love you. And you me, eh? I know. We've always had a good life together. We'll always have a good life together. No. It's all your fault. You'll regret that. You'll regret that. Quick, get out of here. Your Worship! I've come to help you. I've come to help you protect the birds. Well, Adeline. Tell me again about all the things he's done to my lad.
