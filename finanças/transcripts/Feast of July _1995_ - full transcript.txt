Has anybody here seen Jesus?" And he looked straight at me And I was angry because I thought, why is he asking such a stupid question? And I stood up and I shouted back as loud as I could, "No! No! Course we ain't! He's dead, ain't he?" And I got out my pew and I ran down the back of the chapel I opened the door and I ran and I ran until I couldn't run no more There's one of Ben Masters' old disciples Mitchy! Mrs Mitchy!
