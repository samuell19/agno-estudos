LIVID Thursday, October 31 Are you Lucie Klavel? - Do you smoke? - No. When I was in school I had a real hard-ass teacher. Each day, he'd smell our breath. If he got a whiff of tobacco, we'd lose a point on our grades. But I'm the teacher today. You've got wall eyes. I've never seen that before. It's very rare. Know what it's called? Heterochromia. Good. - Know what they say? - Discoloration of the iris. No, not the medical term. Each eye's a different soul. The soul can come and go through each portal. It's a simple discoloration of the iris, nothing more. - I'm Mrs. Wilson. - I know. Call me Catherine. I prefer Mrs. Wilson. As you like, Miss Klavel. Most of our clients can't go to the toilet on their own, so obviously they can't let us in. This old guy doesn't need a lot of care. Just a shot. He's batty, just drools all the time. We only stay 15 minutes, or it screws our schedule and we're stuck in traffic. Hold this. I'm exhausted. Andre? Andre, it's time for your shot. Calm down. It's just me. You can't drop dead this early. Is that my granddaughter? Of course not. She hasn't visited you for years. This is Lucie. A young girl who's with me for 10 days. She's a trainee. And my granddaughter? Is she coming? Say hello to Lucie. Hello, ma'am. Hello, Mr. Marchal. Stop your shenanigans! Stop it! Always the same. He hates it. Can I do it? Have you done it on people? Don't snap the needle in his arm. I can do it. Show me what you can do. It'll be OK, Mr. Marchal. Not bad. Tell my granddaughter to visit me. Her name's Mathilda. Tell her to visit, please. We'll tell her. It's not that we're bored or anything, Andre... but we've got to hit the road. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow, Mr. Marchal. Well, Maddy, what present do you have for us today? Wait for me here. Your work's been good, but you're not up to this one. Who's the patient? Wait here I said. I won't be long. Don't use the radio. It'll kill the battery. Nosey and impatient. I like it. You've got the stuff to succeed in the business. Meet Deborah Jessel. She was a famous dance teacher, and very strict. Some came from Paris to attend her classes. That was before her coma. She's been like this for years. Open the window, please. Some fresh air and daylight. That'll do us some good. Plants need to breathe. I heard you talking. I tell her my problems. I'm sure she won't interrupt me or blab to anyone. It's cheaper than therapy. Reading was one of Jessel's rare pleasures. Do you like reading? Yeah. Then choose one. What? Go on, just choose one. Don't think. That's how I choose. I know nothing about literature. Go on, take your pick. Close your eyes. Pick. Just some nasty moth. I don't have much time to read with school. Want to do this? Why a transfusion? What do I know? I'm no doctor. And even less a manicurist. Doesn't take much to cut nails. She couldn't care less about her nails. Won't her family say we're shirking our job? Her family? We only know about a daughter. Mute at birth. Moreover, she's dead. Dead even before your parents met. Why isn't she in an old-age home? Dying at home was her final wish. If you've money coming out of your ears, final wishes are respected. Deborah Jessel is very rich. They say she's got a treasure. What treasure? Surely cash, jewels, gold bullion... Whatever, a treasure's value is often in its secrecy. You can imagine I've tried every lock in this damn place. She's no chance of coming out of her coma? No, well yeah... Same chance as me meeting a guy who's loaded and whisks me away from this misery. It's irreversible, then. Close the shutters. If they're open, and we have an inspection, I'll catch hell. Rotten snitches. I hate those medical inspectors. Good night, Deborah. Don't do anything too wild tonight. Well, I know this darn job isn't always easy, but you did good work for your first day. Thanks a lot, Mrs. Wilson. You're welcome, Miss Klavel. So see you tomorrow? Same time, same punishment. See you tomorrow. Good night. Hey, Lucie! You OK? - I missed you. - Me too. How's things? William! - You're so damn pretty. - Stop. Just because I stink of fish... William! You're not going anywhere till we unload the fish. Come on. I got it. Hello, Mr. Kerrian. She said hello! Hello, Lucie. Don't worry. I'll be quick. We'll grab a beer after. You can tell me about your day. You good, Mom? I'm good, honey. You good? You good, Yohan? How are you, Lucie? You've come to taunt me at work with this loser stinking of sardines? You got it, now go and earn the 50 measly euros Mom pays you, and bring us two Celtikas. I'll see what I can do. Quenching sailors' thirst is your job. Sorry. Tell me about your day. It was OK. The nurse I'm with is a big mouth, but pretty cool. - Tell me about the patients. - Most don't talk. What a nightmare. Remember that big house on the moor, near Carantec? Of course I do. You kidding? My mom forbid us to hang out there. Ben and I'd go by for the thrill. Why? Did you go there? Maybe... - What's up after? - Nothing with you. I'll be done soon, if Mom... - Hey, Ben! - Coming. Damn, no time to breathe. Get going. Cheers. So, did you really go? What's there? Just an old woman. An old woman? Old is the word... she's over a hundred. Still alive, but a total vegetable. Sorry, sweetie, but that's not so exciting. Because I didn't finish. The old lady's in a coma, but she's very rich. According to the nurse, she's got hidden treasure. What kind of treasure? She doesn't know. She's still looking. What if we find it first? We just break a window... What? Have you lost your mind? Suddenly you want to rob little old ladies? What are you talking about? I dunno. Just want to change my life. Don't you? What's wrong with your life? What's up? What are you talking about? I'm 22 years old, same hands as my dad. I love the ocean! I don't want to suffer a slow death, like my dad and his before him. I never had a choice. It's death! I want to live on dry land with you. Far from here. Same with Ben. How long will you be Mom's flunkey? No idea what this is about. What's going on? I'm leaving. Lucie. Hey, Lucie! What's with you? You tell me your dad's got money problems. He works nights since your mom's death. Leave my mom where she is. You're a kid... I can't tell you a thing without you imagining crazy stuff. Remind me, weren't you in jail, for stealing a TV from a cop's house? Don't bring that up! That bastard was a friggin' fence. You know it. I gotta get back to work or my dad will skin me alive. But think it over, please. Think it over. Yes, honey, this weekend. I've got to go. Lucie walked in, and I've work. I'll tell her. Lucie... I'm going to work. She's already your honey? Only 8 months after mom's death. Your mother chose to go, and Janice is a nice woman. What did "nice" Janice ask you to tell me? That's she's moving in. What? I've got to go, sweetie. I, we... We'll talk tomorrow. I'll be late. Hello? We break nothing and take the essentials. Just enough to make a better life. You won't regret it. I hope not. Hey losers, scared to pick granny's pockets without me? It's your driver's license we need. Drive! You shouldn't have lost yours. Shit. My bike's better than this heap! You know what to buy him with your share. Don't badmouth my car. It always starts. Get lost! You're hideous! See? I told you it always starts. Hold on, park there. Gotta play it safe. Let's walk. Take this. You nuts? It's my pillow case. Shut up! Let me get this straight... you want us traipsing for 2 hours looking like Ku Klux Klan? What's the point of these? Scare the old bird to death! Trick or treat, granny? No way! Are you kidding? Are you done? Take it, I said! Let's go. Ready for a little stroll on the moor? I'm ready to get rich. With all that dough, we'll live together and you'll serve me breakfast in bed. You'll have to sleep in the kitchen, honey. We've been going 25 minutes. I'm bushed. My shoes are soaked. Do you know the way, Lucie? Stop whistling, William. Cool it. Nobody can hear us. You know what they say: Whistling on the moor on Halloween is bad luck. That's what the local winos say. What the hell's she doing? Chasing will-o'- the-wisps awakes the Grim Reaper. Screw that! Shit! Here. Disappointing. It's almost too easy. We'll soon see. Don't worry about the door. I'll kick it in if I have to. Without a crowbar, we're stuck out here. No damage or I'm outta here. I told you! I'm not finished yet, sweetie. Don't worry. - Keep looking. - Where ya going? Come on. He really means it. It was a bad idea to do a burglary with guys like you. We can still get a beer at the bar. Will... Will, listen. I've something important to say. Lucie's offering drinks if we leave. Will's offering a new life if we get in. Listen, dude! We won't make it unless we break a window. Who knows what's in there. - Who knows what's in there. - Who knows? We soon will. Now come on! Welcome. Now what's your plan? Shit, he's such an asshole! Come on, sweetie. Are you good? Ben! Come on, Ben. Yeah, I'm coming. I've always followed you around, asshole. You OK? It's gonna be hell getting out... especially if we're hauling the loot. We'll worry about that later. If there's treasure, it's not in this mess. Let's go upstairs. Hey, Klavel, what in hell are you doing? I told you we'd get in. Where's the old lady? On the top floor. Come on! Can't see a thing. Turn on a light. Great idea. Wanna call the cops, too? Instead of talking shit, start searching. Will, I don't have a good feeling. You mean you don't want your share? Look at this. I think it's silver. It's worth bucks. - Do you need a teapot? - I dunno. Get real. Scissors! Wanna go to the flea market with them? What do I know? No, treasure's got to be a pile of money or jewels. Let's hope so. Holy shit! Shit. Son of a bitch! I nearly shit myself. What do you call stuffing animals? Taxidermy. You wimp. Taxidermy. - No damage, right? - Sorry. Looks like your girlfriend. Damn, there's padlocks everywhere. Who cares. Let's go up. What are these drawings? Jessel only had one daughter. Mute from birth and dead for years. She won't hassle us for the inheritance. Hey, get over here! What's this shit? A life-size doll's tea party! What kid would play with... It's nothing. After you. God dammit! Why dammit? If this door's shut, and the others aren't, there's a reason. The reason is there's treasure behind it! OK, William, but we've no key. No shit, Sherlock! Jessel... She's got a key around her neck. That key must open this door! Wanna go up and get it? Are you sure she's out of it? - I'm not going. - No harm borrowing it. Just for a while. Good work, sweetie! Shit! Let me do it. Let's get the hell out! This place is trouble! We put the key back and split. Fuck off! I'm telling you... What the hell did you do? No turning back. Now we go for it. Shit! Damn! There's nothing here! Where the hell does she hide her dough? Shit, there's nothing! Shut up! Holy shit. What the hell's this? It's a corpse. Jessel's daughter? She must be the treasure. Flash the light down there. Shut up! No! What's that? The old woman? Impossible. It's nothing. It's the house creaking. Let's get out of here. Come on! - Climb up! - Help me! What the hell is this? We're locked in! The window in Jessel's room... It's not locked. What are you saying? We can't go that way. Didn't you here that noise? It can't be her. It's our only way out! Will? Let's try. Come on. - Where is she? - Mrs. Jessel? We gotta get out of here. And now! Try the window. - Lucie, you said... - I swear it was open earlier! Gotta find something to break this damn padlock! Ben? Where the fuck are you? This way, Lucie. Come on! Fuck, there's no door! There's no door! Holy crap! Her name was Anna. What do you mean? Jessel's daughter. Who the fuck cares. Let's search her room. There's nothing there... no treasure, no key! Stay here. Keep on with the shutters. Don't be stupid. We don't split up until we find Ben. Will, do what I say. Ophelie, you don't know what you're doing! Out of the class, now! Girls, go home immediately! Curtsy. Now go! Anna! Only people we don't know! Anna. Anna, don't go out! And don't try escaping at night. Lucie? Is... Is that you Lucie? William... Ben? What the hell is that... thing on your head? Where the hell were you? Cut it out, Ben! What's going on? I'm locked in! Stop, Ben! William! Dance. Go on! Go on. The sun and moon don't want you. The humans down below even less. Your world is here... with me. Now dance. Again. Concentrate on dancing. Don't put us in danger by running away. Go on, releve! Go on! Stretch. Go on. Go on. Go on! Lower. Lower! Go on! More! Anna, Anna... you're not dead. Just broken. Mrs. Wilson? What the... what are you doing? Just my job. Wilson? What are you doing here? Why haven't you gone home, like the others? You should've chosen another book, my dear. William... He did what he could. Mommy. Anna... wake up. I'm human. Dance, my child. Dance! Come on! Don't try escaping at night. Adaptation by Pamela Grant Subtitling by L.V.T. - Paris
