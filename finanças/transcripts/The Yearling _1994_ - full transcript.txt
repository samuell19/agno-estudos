[ SLOW WALTZ ] CARE TO FINISH THIS DANCE? PA! JUMP, JODY. PA, HELP! GET A BLOCK FOR THE WHEEL. ORRIE! AAH! EZRA. ARE YOU HURT, PA? YES, I THINK MY ANKLE'S BROKE. LET ME SEE. LET ME LOOK. FLAG, YOU GET OUT OF THERE. DON'T MIND THAT NOW. HELP ME TO THE HOUSE WITH YOUR PA. IS WHAT THE BOY SAY TRUE, LEM? HE'S A LIAR JUST LIKE HIS DADDY. MY DADDY AIN'T NEVER TOLD A LIE IN HIS LIFE, AND I AIN'T LYING, EITHER. I SAW YOU UNDER THAT WAGON. STEALING THEM HOGS WAS BAD ENOUGH, LEM. THIS IS MORE THAN I CAN STOMACH. I'D RATHER HAVE ME AN HONEST AND FRIENDLY NEIGHBOR THAN A SNEAKY, LOW-DOWN COWARD FOR A BROTHER. COME ON, BOY. DID YOU HEAR WHAT BUCK SAY TO ME? HIS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD. YOU GOT TO BED OUT HERE, FLAG. MA WON'T HAVE YOU STOMPING AROUND THE HOUSE, NOT WITH PA AILING. YOU BED YOURSELF DOWN BESIDE OLD CAESAR AND YOU WON'T FEEL LONESOME AT ALL. GOOD NIGHT, FLAG. [ ROOSTER CROWS ] PA, WAKE UP. IT RAINED. WELL, AIN'T THAT GOOD NEWS. CAN I GO SEE IF THE CORN'S GROWED ANY IN THE NIGHT? I'LL HAVE BREAKFAST ON WHEN YOU GET BACK. GIT, GIT, GIT! WELL, SON? HAS IT GROWED UP OVERNIGHT LIKE THE GIANT'S BEANSTALK? SOMETHING'S ET MOST OF IT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT DONE IT? IT WAS FLAG DONE IT, WASN'T IT? HE WERE RESTLESS IN THE PEN, MA. HE'S USED TO SLEEPING WITH ME. I TIED HIM IN THE PEN. HE ET THROUGH HIS LEAD AND JUMPED THE FENCE. GET YOU OUTSIDE AND PLAY, BOY. YOUR PA AND I GOT TO TALK. DON'T EAT OUR CROP, FLAG. DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DONE? GIT! GET AWAY. GET AWAY FROM ME. GET AWAY! SIT DOWN. YOU AIN'T NEVER KNOWN HUNGER, AND I DON'T WANT YOU SHOULD EVER KNOW IT. WE CAN'T HAVE OUR YEAR'S CROP DESTROYED WHEN WE WAS DEPENDING ON IT LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE CAN'T GO HUNGRY, SON. I'M SORRY, AND I CAN'T NEVER TELL YOU HOW SORRY. YOU GOT TO TAKE THE YEARLING OUT IN THE WOODS IN THE MORNING AND TIE HIM UP AND SHOOT HIM. PA, I PLANTED THE FIELD ALL OVER. WE'RE GONNA HAVE US A CROP. AND HE'LL TAKE THIS ONE, TOO. EVEN IF IT MAKES THIS LATE, NOW HE'S HAD A TASTE OF IT, WE COULDN'T KEEP HIM OUT OF THERE WITH A SIX-FOOT FENCE. PA, I'LL MAKE HIM A CHAIN. IT'S NO USE. A BUCK DEER AIN'T MEANT TO LIVE ON A CHAIN. I CAN'T SHOOT HIM, PA. I WON'T. I TOLD YOU IT WEREN'T A SIMPLE THING TO BE A MAN. NOW YOU KNOW WHY. WE'LL JUST STAY IN THE WOODS TONIGHT. IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT TOMORROW. THEY'LL BE SORRY FOR WHAT THEY SAID. COME WITH ME. FLAG? [ GUNSHOT ] FLAG! IT HAD TO BE DONE, JODY. FINISH HIM, JODY. YOU GOT TO PUT HIM OUT'N HIS TORMENT. I'D DO IT MYSELF IF'N I COULD.

I'M SORRY. [ COCKS GUN ] [ GUNSHOT ] WHAT THE GOOD LORD DIDN'T TAKE, I DROVE AWAY MYSELF. YOU SAY YOU SPARE THEM FOR MY SAKE, EZRA. THAT AIN'T SO. YOU TAKE HIM OFF, AND YOU TEACH HIM THE WAYS OF MEN, BUT YOU LEAVE IT TO ME TO DO THE HARD THINGS, TO SAY THE THINGS HE DON'T WANT TO HEAR, MAKE HIM DO THINGS HE DON'T WANT TO DO. IT WAS YOU THAT GIVE HIM THE DEER, AND IT WAS ME THAT TOOK HIM AWAY. I KNOWED THE DAY HE BROUGHT IT HOME THAT'S HOW IT WOULD END... AND SO DID YOU. I WON'T FORGET YOU, FLAG. I'LL NEVER GO BACK. I'VE GOT TO GO FIND HIM. I KNOW. FOLLOW THE STREAM. IF HE'S STILL IN THE SCRUB, HE'S LIKE TO BE NEAR FRESH WATER. JODY! JODY! JODY! JODY! JODY! YOU GO ON. YOU GO ON WITH YOUR MAMMY. ORRIE? IT'S ME. JODY. YOU AIN'T DEAD OR GONE. OH, GLORY BE. I AIN'T MEANT WHAT I SAID, HATING YOU. ARE YOU HUNGRY? THERE'S BISCUITS IN THE CABINET. OPEN THE HONEY. THERE'S DUE TO BE SOME MILK. [ CHUCKLES ] NOW YOU KNOW. OLD STARVATION'S GOT A FACE MEANER THAN OLD SLEW-FOOT, AIN'T HE? YES, SIR. COME HERE, BOY. YOU FIGURE I WENT BACK ON YOU. THAT'S THE THING EVERY MAN HAS GOT TO KNOW. MAYBE YOU KNOW IT NOW. 'TWEREN'T ONLY ME. 'TWEREN'T ONLY YOUR MA. JODY... LIFE GOES BACK ON YOU. A MAN'S HEART ACHES SEEING HIS YOUNG'UNS FACE THE WORLD, KNOWING THEY GOT TO GET THEIR GUTS TORE OUT, THE WAY HIS WAS TORE. I WANTED TO SPARE YOU AS LONG AS I COULD. I WANTED YOU TO FROLIC WITH YOUR YEARLING. I KNOW THE LONESOMENESS HE EASED FOR YOU. BUT EVERY MAN IS LONESOME. WHAT'S A MAN TO DO? ONLY ONE THING TO DO. TAKE IT FOR HIS SHARE AND GO ON. [ DOG BARKS ] IT WERE MINE TO DO, AND WHEN YOU DONE IT FOR ME, I CURSED YOU. YOU KNEW I WOULD, AND YOU DONE IT ANYHOW 'CAUSE IT NEEDED DOING, JUST LIKE YOU SAID. IT AIN'T 'CAUSE I HATE YOU THAT I DIDN'T COME HOME, 'CAUSE I WAS TOO ASHAMED TO. YOU GOT NO CAUSE TO FEEL SHAME. I HOPE I WON'T ANYMORE. YOU'VE LEARNED ME HOW TO BE A MAN. AS HARD AS I AM ON YOU, YOU GOT TO KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU. MA, YOU THINK I COULD HAVE A HUNTING DOG OF MY OWN NOW? [ LAUGHS ] TIME IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR. I'M PROUD YOU CHOOSE TO COME HOME, SON. THE SCRUB IS WHERE I BELONG. I DON'T WANT NO OTHER LIFE. SHAKE HANDS. I THINK I KNOW HOW WE MIGHT GET US A WELL, PA. LEM HAS GONE TO LIVE WITH OUR KINFOLK IN KENTUCKY. THEY'S MOSTLY HORSE THIEVES. THEY'LL BE RIGHT GLAD TO HAVE HIM. WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO LEM'S STILL? WHY, YOU LITTLE BASTARD! YOU INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT THE MOONSHINE BUSINESS? NAH, BUT I'D BE INTERESTED IN THE BRICKS. YEAH, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT. I'M COUNTING ON YOU, BUCK. I REALLY NEED THOSE BRICKS. I CAN TELL.
