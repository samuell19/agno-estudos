Announcer: The following is a presentation of HBO Sports. (birds chirping) (wind blowing) (distant dog barking) Come over now. Narrator: At 78 years of age, he can no longer rely on himself. ♪ ♪ And while that may not sound too unusual, if you know who he is, and all he's done, there's a certain shock to how this final chapter is unfolding. ♪ ♪ Ultimately, there's no simple way to look back on a complex life lived... (indistinct broadcast) Narrator: ...and determine if it's a tale that's happy or sad. I want to thank you fans because you're behind us now! (crowd cheering) Narrator: We usually think of the lucky ones as those able to do things that change their paths in extraordinary ways. But no one ever completely escapes the whims of fate... that can end up defining what their story becomes. (big band playing "In The Mood") (projector whirring) ♪ ♪ Narrator: 1940 in America. The Great Depression was approaching its end, war had already begun to rage an ocean away... - (cheering) - ...and Franklin Roosevelt was reelected for a third term as president. And two weeks before the year's end, in Springfield, Massachusetts, Nicholas Anthony Buoniconti Jr. was born, the first child of Nicholas Sr. and his wife Pasqualina, who ran a bakery in the city's South End. Buoniconti: My childhood was magical because... I lived in an all Italian neighborhood. There was no crime. It was such a great time to grow up. This was a dream childhood. ♪ ♪ The bakery was a central part of our life. Mercolino's was founded by my grandfather, Henry Mercolino, and he sold it to my father, and together, they got up every morning at 4:30 to go out and make the fresh bread. We ate the bread every single night, and it was... it was delightful. (chuckles) That work ethic that my father had was instilled in me. ♪ ♪ Narrator: The Buonicontis lived in a two-family home on Margaret Street, where the youngest of the family's three boys, Peter, watched his big brother's remarkable tale begin to unfold. When I was eight years old, I realized just how good my brother was in sports. He was my idol. I mean, he was the whole family's idol. He had three things going for him: He was the best athlete in the South End, he was one of the smartest kids in the South End, and he was the toughest kid in the South End. So, he was just a special kid. Newsreel Narrator: The Perils of Pauline weren't as tense as the balloting for All-America guard honors. Nick Buoniconti, Notre Dame's bruising 210-pound co-captain, drew heavy support for defensive dandies - that rocked Irish opposition. - (cheering) Narrator: While he was great at all sports, it was football that earned the kid from Springfield a scholarship to Notre Dame, making him the first in his family to go to college. As a co-captain his senior year, he led the team in tackles and was named an all-American. But at just five-foot, eleven, and a little over 200 pounds, it didn't appear a pro career was much of an option. Nick: My coach didn't recommend me for pro ball because he said I was too small. He said, "Nick Buoniconti will run through the wall, but the hole he leaves will be small." And I didn't get drafted by the NFL. I just got drafted by the AFL, the Patriots in the 13th round. On my first day of practice, I got into a fistfight with the tight end. Mike Holovak was the coach, and he chased me out of practice because he said... I don't know what he said. It's, it's, uh... Everything is jumbled for me, you know? It's just not... It's just not possible for me to do... to do it without stumbling. (distant crowd cheering) Narrator: By 1963, Buoniconti's second year with the Patriots, he was an all-star, one of the best linebackers in the upstart American Football League. He also married his high school sweetheart. And by 1966, Nick and Terry Buoniconti had three small children, Gina, Nick III, and Marc. Buoniconti: Juggling football and having a family was difficult. What was more difficult is, I started going to law school, and I would practice until two o'clock every day, and then I would study in the law library and brief cases. Yeah, it was... it was crazy. He just loved his education. He loved to further it, keep his mind busy. And it made sense to him that attending law school would be a big help to him down the road. Nick: Once I got my law degree, I was determined not to let football rule me, you know? Narrator: But that determination was tested in 1969 when the Patriots traded him to the struggling Miami Dolphins. He briefly entertained thoughts of retirement, but ultimately negotiated a long-term deal for himself that put him, at age 28, on a roster full of youngsters, like second-year safety Dick Anderson. (crowd cheering) Anderson: Nick was a very serious player, and, um, he was a leader, and we had a young team. It was an expansion team. Nick was able to come in and immediately become the leader of our defense. They were a very bad team. A matter of fact, the first year, we only won three games. Until Shula got there, and then after that, it was, you know, a different... a different story. I think there's gonna be a tremendous amount of pressure on you, Don, because you've come from a winning team, and they're gonna expect you to produce a winner overnight. The thing is, as I mentioned, I'm gonna work as hard as anybody can work to make the Miami Dolphins a winner as close as... in the near future as I possibly can. ♪ ♪ Narrator: Don Shula had been one of the most successful coaches in football with the Baltimore Colts. But coming to Miami in 1970 was a turnaround job. And he wasn't sure number 85, the starting middle linebacker he inherited, was a piece of the puzzle. Shula: Before I took the job, I really didn't know a lot about Nick. But when I first saw him, I couldn't believe that a guy that was that small had been able to accomplish as much as he accomplished as a player. So, I was looking at him... "This is the guy?" You know, "I've gotta work with him?" When you reported here with the veterans for the spring session, you were told to gain a few pounds before reporting. Is this your normal playing weight? No, right now, I'm about, uh, I figure about 12 pounds under playing weight. I weighed in about 210 this morning, but I don't anticipate any trouble. I figure I'll go in about 215 into camp, and I'll go from there. If I have to gain weight, then I'll just eat some extra meals. ♪ ♪ Narrator: Buoniconti might've had to look for extra meals here and there, but his intensity needed no boost, in the cafeteria or beyond. Anderson: One day, going to lunch, Nick got fed up with the food, and he threw the tray at the chef. The food did improve after that. So, you know, he could be fiery when he wanted to be. Buoniconti: There was one time when Shula was getting angry at Dick Anderson, and, uh, I intervened, and I told Shula to go fuck himself. I thought he was out of line. He didn't like that. He took me aside, and he said, "Don't you ever tell me to go fuck myself again." And I didn't. He was the boss, and I was the player. And he let me know it. If Nick felt that he was right, he would do whatever he had to do to get his point across. He'd be their attorney, the attorney for the defense. The best quality that he had was he was this competitive, ferocious fighter. I mean, the guy wouldn't give up. - (cheering) - He was very intelligent. The more I got to know him, the more I realized that I had something that was very, very special on my hands. Narrator: And from there, the coach would take his captain and the Dolphins on an historic run. - ("I'll Take You There" playing) - ♪ Oh, ho ♪ ♪ I know a place ♪ ♪ Ain't nobody crying ♪ Announcer: It goes to Kiick again!

Kroft: There were really too many names. It was part of the reason why they didn't have any names. Um... I think that Nick and Dick Anderson were the two most famous people on the defensive, Nick by quite a margin. I mean, he was a 215-pound linebacker. Nick was really the center of that defense. You know, he was the alpha dog. He's an alpha dog in every room that he's in. ♪ I'll take you there ♪ Narrator: And by 1972, his team was the unquestioned alpha dog of the National Football League. Newsman: It is so recorded in the folklore of professional football, on any given day, any team could defeat any other. But this year, it may not be so, for no team yet during the regular season has yet defeated the mighty Miami Dolphins. Hut... hut! Kaplow: Do you fellas have any feeling that maybe you're doing something that would be considered historic in football? Yeah, I want it to be historic because I won't be satisfied unless we go 17 and 0. ♪ ♪ Narrator: Miami went to Superbowl VII still unbeaten and faced off against the Washington Redskins. Announcer: Kilmer's quick flip, intercepted! Buoniconti at the 50, 45, 40! Buoniconti out of bounds. Narrator: Led by Buoniconti and the defense, the Dolphins won the game 14 to seven and finished off the only perfect season to date in NFL history. Announcer: Superbowl VII is over. The Miami Dolphins have not only won the Superbowl, but they've done something unprecedented. Buoniconti: It was great to be a Superbowl winner. I felt like I contributed really good. Being the only undefeated team in the history of the game was, was really special to me. (crowd cheering) Shula: Well, it took a while to grasp, you know, what the accomplishment was.

Only one team was perfect. - (cheering) - (honking) ♪ 'Cause we are the Miami Dolphins ♪ ♪ Miami Dolphins ♪ ♪ Miami Dolphins, number one ♪ ♪ Yes, we're the Miami Dolphins ♪ ♪ Miami Dolphins ♪ ♪ Miami Dolphins, number one ♪ Narrator: The accomplishment would be not only momentous in the lives of the team and their fans, but was also a catalyst in reviving the resort city the Dolphins called home. It was a great time to be in Miami when that was going on. The town had been downtrodden for a while, and the Dolphins played a big part in the resurrection and rebirth of Miami. (honking) - And Nick was one of the centerpieces of it. After the Superbowl, we go to Joe's Stone Crabs in Miami, and I would take my Superbowl ring off, give it to the waiter, he would, in turn, give it to the chef, and we got the best stone crabs you ever had in your life. Nick wasn't alone in doing that. I know I enjoyed doing that. I know that, uh, our other players enjoyed doing it. But Nick, he used to like to flash that ring around. I love this ring. I'll always... I'll always treasure this ring. ♪ ♪ Narrator: Buoniconti and the Dolphins would win a second Superbowl ring by repeating the following year. But in 1975, the team missed the playoffs, as their defensive captain sat out the entire season with a hand injury. I was not ready to retire when I got hurt in '75. But, uh, I was willing to retire. But they offered me more money than I had ever seen before. It was, like, $50,000, which was not a lot of money today, but it was then. I bought myself a Mercedes. (chuckles) And, uh, I came back to play one more year for Shula. Buoniconti: Well, I decided, you know, this was gonna be my last year, it's my 15th. As far as my pension is concerned, it's a good place to stop. I just don't wanna hang on. I don't wanna go on again. And this is it, I'm calling it quits. Narrator: The last game of one of the more improbable careers in NFL history came in December of 1976, in front of the home fans at the Orange Bowl. Buoniconti: It was against the Minnesota Vikings, and I'll never forget it. I ended up on my hands and knees, kissed the ground, and thanked the Lord that I didn't get seriously injured. ♪ ♪ I thought it... that I was walking away in one piece. Little did I know, later on, it would come back to haunt me. ♪ ♪ (projector whirring) Narrator: If football was the foundation of the first 35 years of Nick Buoniconti's life, his next chapter would expand his horizons far beyond the field. Still, to his children, he would continue to be the middle linebacker they'd always idolized. Growing up, my dad was my hero. I emulated him growing up, in the yard, playing football. My brother did too. And all the Dolphins, for that matter. We always... We were always Dolphins fans, and we were either Nick Buoniconti or Mercury Morris, depending on whether we were playing on offense or defense. So, that's how it went every day in our backyard. I think what most impressed me, in what you could see in my father, was his work ethic, and that he always believed that you needed to perform to the best of your ability at all times. The education, the manners, the way you carry yourself... I mean, it had to be at the utmost level. I remember when I was in Pop Warner, probably about 12 years old, and I was loafing on the field. They gave this ball to this kid, and he ran around the corner. I probably could've chased him down, but I totally gave up on the play. My dad walked down the stands. The next thing I know, he's got me by the face mask, and he said, "You're playing like a fucking pussy." And he said, "If you continue to play like this, I'm gonna rip you off this fucking field." And I was just, I was shocked. But I was so angry 'cause he was right. When it came to high school football, he was not ashamed of sending notes down to the coaches about what's going on with the defense that they were playing or the offense that they were playing. I mean, how do you say no to what Nick Buoniconti... and Don Shula, by the way, 'cause Mike Shula was our quarterback in high school. Both my mom and Mrs. Shula kicked them to the top of the stands because of all the crap they'd be saying. You know, like, Oh my God, I can't believe they're calling this play. I can't believe they're calling that play. And the coaches would be like, oh, you know... What do you do? I'd probably take their advice if I was them. ♪ ♪ And my clients, two people that I really believe in, my ex-teammates, and if they're given an opportunity to play the National League or the Canadian League this year, an opportunity to redeem themselves to society, and the only way they can redeem themselves is to become useful citizens, then I think it could make the court very, very proud. Narrator: While Buoniconti had worked as a lawyer in the off-seasons during his football career, after retiring, he took it up full-time. And soon, also began representing other athletes as an agent. His client list included Miami native, and future Hall of Fame outfielder Andre Dawson. Dawson: When I first met Nick, I was somewhat in awe of him because of who he was. My impression was that he was pretty much a straight shooter. He spoke what he believed, and, um, I was pretty impressed with him, and at that point, I hired him. Narrator: In 1981, Buoniconti helped make Dawson one of the highest paid players in baseball, negotiating a six-year contract extension with the Montreal Expos worth a million dollars a year. Dawson: I got that call from from him, and he said, "Are you sitting down?" I said, "Yeah, I'm sitting down." He said, "Well, I want you to know you're gonna be the next six million dollar man." It was a pretty ecstatic moment. I was a good negotiator. Matter of fact, George Steinbrenner, in his book, said that I was the toughest guy he ever negotiated with. I was... When Bucky Dent hit the home run that won the pennant for the Yankees, I negotiated his contract. Narrator: Buoniconti might've been tough at the table, but by no accounts, did he extend much of a personal touch with his clients. I don't recall him picking up the phone too, too much. You know, he wasn't a hands-on type. Buoniconti: No, I was not a hand-holder. Everybody kissed their butts, but I wasn't about to kiss anybody's butt. I told them, you hit and I'll get you the money. ♪ ♪ Narrator: Eventually, he left his agent days behind to focus on other pursuits, among them, a job he'd gotten in 1979, cohosting HBO's weekly Inside the NFL series, alongside former Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson. And I'm really happy to be working with you this year, Nick Buoniconti. Thank you, Len. We go back a long way. I guess we played against each other for almost 15 years of my career, and... I remember those beady eyes, number 16, wearing that Kansas City outfit, and it's really great for the first time in my life to be on the same team. Narrator: And while he enjoyed becoming a familiar fixture on TV, his fame helped him land a very different job in 1983, at the company US Tobacco, a top manufacturer of smokeless tobacco products, where he'd been a spokesperson and board member for years. Buoniconti: The CEO of the company, Lou Bantle, offered me a senior vice president's job, and, uh, I took it. I loved the corporate world. I was making at least 10 times what I was making in my best years in the NFL. And, uh, yeah, I was a good executive. I was, I was tough, like I always was. My first impression of Nick was a man of intensity. I thought he was good-looking. Nick could be difficult, certainly demanding, but I liked him immensely. Nick's not a classic corporate executive. Nick didn't go to Wharton. You know, Nick was an instinct guy. That's why he was a fabulous middle linebacker. People at US Tobacco, they were terrified of him! They said the worst day at US Tobacco is when you open the elevator doors and there was Nick, because you were stuck with him. He would know your job as well as you should've, and he would rapid-fire, machine-gun pellet people with questions, until he got the answer he wanted. So, people would come out of the elevator, like, stumbling. Or they'd have to go to the lunchroom and have a cup of coffee. It was... that was Nick. (clock ticking) Ed Bradley: The people who are dipping smokeless may think they're avoiding the dangers of tobacco by not smoking, but there is substantial evidence that they're not. Narrator: In February 1985, Nick Buoniconti, the corporate executive, was thrust into the national spotlight when he was chosen by his company to defend it in an investigative report. The science, as we know it today, tells us that smokeless tobacco has never been scientifically established to cause any harm to humans, that includes oral cancer. I was always amazed at Nick during 60 Minutes. I mean, he wasn't afraid of Ed Bradley. He knew what his job was. There is no one saying that it does cause a problem. The Surgeon General says it does. - The American Health Foundation says it does. - Cause, okay. Okay, cause. Gordon: I mean, it was a very difficult interview. And it was really the first time that Nick had been in a situation that had been that controversial and that confrontational. Nick was used to people saying yes to him. Scientists who are funded through the Smokeless Tobacco Research Council say that that has not been scientifically established to cause any harm to humans. It's... It's hard for me to look, look at that clip. I was not aware of the dangers of smokeless tobacco at that point. No one likes negative publicity. And, uh... it was negative, you know. It was really negative. And so... I have to live with it. And I have lived with it. I think that if anybody knows what causes oral cancer, then they ought to stand up and say what causes oral cancer 'cause they would save a lot of people a lot of agony and suffering. Kroft: My feeling is, he handled himself very well, better than most CEOs that we interview and ask tough questions to. Um... You know, he was playing for, you know, US Tobacco was his team. He was leading the company. I mean, everybody gets punched in the balls by 60 Minutes. I mean, you know... But I think Lou Bantle liked the fact that he took it on the chin, one for the team, and... So, it didn't affect his status. In fact, it... pah-choo! ♪ ♪ Narrator: Sure enough, four months after that report aired, Buoniconti was named his company's president and chief operating officer. The baker's boy was now 44 years old, already a model of success after football in every which way. His three children were flourishing, too, with Gina at the University of Florida, and his boys following in their dad's footsteps as middle linebackers. Nick at Duke, and Marc at The Citadel. 1985 was Marc's sophomore season. On October 26th, his team went on the road to play East Tennessee State. In the first quarter, he made a seemingly routine tackle that would change his life forever. Marc: It's hard to express exactly what the feeling was because there was no feeling. It's just... the realization that you can't move, that you can't breathe. And I looked down, and I didn't even know it was my arm 'cause it was just laying there very odd. Until I kind of followed it with my eyes, and I realized it was connected to my shoulder. And right then, in that split second, I knew I was paralyzed. ♪ ♪ Buoniconti: It was a beautiful fall afternoon, and, uh, I got a phone call. And the doctor said, "Your son, uh... "Your son... dislocated his neck, and he's gonna be a quadriplegic for the rest of his life." I fell to my knees, and, uh, and I... I really... was, you know, just... I couldn't believe it. It was just traumatic. ♪ ♪ After the phone call, I went out and told his mother that Marc was paralyzed, and, of course, she cried. ♪ ♪ The doctor said, "Please get here as soon as you can. He's dying." I cried and I cried and I cried and I cried. And-And then... (sighs) It's very difficult talk about it. ♪ ♪ Narrator: Nick and Terry flew to Tennessee that night, as everyone in the family tried in vain to make sense of what had happened. I just kind of shut down, trying to get to the airport, trying to... process it all, at the same time, crying. Didn't really... bellow out a huge cry until you, till you walk in and see your brother. I mean, that's... (gulps) ...that's pretty tough. (sniffles, sighs) That is a life-changing moment. That's all you can say. ♪ ♪ Buoniconti: He had... tubes in his nose and throat, and he was breathing by... with the help of a respirator. And, uh... You know, that's how you see your son. You know, it just... it's just not... not the way I expected it. You know? It's still vivid. Still vivid. Still vivid, like it happened yesterday. I have nightmares about that. Nick III: I've never seen my father cry, I don't think, or breakdown, or anything like that, until then. Then, of course, no reason, but, you know, I think my dad talked about blaming himself for playing football, and all this crap, and... No one ever thought that but him, but he did feel... a lot of responsibility 'cause his son was following in his footsteps. ♪ ♪ Marc: I don't know who got their first, honestly. By then, I was pretty out of it, and I think they were medicating me pretty much. But the part that I remember was they were all there, and that's when my dad was by my side, um, holding my hand. I don't know how he mustered up the energy to say this or... how he came up with this, but he said all the right words. Looked me in my eyes, and he could see that I was dying there. I couldn't talk because of all the tubes in my nose and throat and everything. But he could see in my eyes, "Dad, help me." So, he looked at me and said, "Marc, "I promise that I'll do everything in my power to help you." I, uh, I made that promise not knowing the challenges ahead of me. Uh... I had called Duke, and I had called Harvard, and they told me that the... the best place for, uh, for me to take Marc was the University of Miami because they had a... a specialist there, Dr. Barth Green. Marc: Little did we know that we had the best neurosurgeon in the world right in our backyard. So, it was decided then that let's go to Miami. ♪ ♪ Green: They wanted to get Marc down here as quickly as possible. Everybody agreed that this was the right place for him 'cause we had established a nationally recognized spinal cord injury program. It's a little early. He's just been here less than 24 hours to make a definite statement. I think where someone's alive, there's always hope. ♪ ♪ The fact is because Marc was in great physical condition and very strong mentally and physically, he had that ability to be one of the few survivors of... of that level injury at the top of his spine. Buoniconti: I wasn't sure Marc was gonna live until Dr. Green assured me that he was gonna live. It was a very difficult time because... I had no idea... what, you know, what was gonna happen to him. Nick III: I think we cried... (sighs) ...off and on, nonstop for three or four days. I don't know. It was like that, and then that was it. Then it was, all right. What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get him out of his wheelchair? This is not... This is not an acceptable scenario, and let's get to work. So, that literally is how that went... Cry, cry, cry, and then... put the hammer down. After Marc's injury, Nick realized he couldn't go into the laboratory and do cellular transplants, or create new surgical procedures. But what he could do was let the world know that anything could be solved, and together, we came up with the concept of the Miami Project. (cheering) Narrator: Less than two months after the accident, on December 16th, 1985, the first fundraiser for that concept took place in Miami during Monday Night Football. Buoniconti: The Patriots were playing the Dolphins at the Orange Bowl. Uh, and, uh, American Express said they would match all the money that we raised at that game. And we raised $250,000, and that was the beginning of the Miami Project. I played on the greatest team in the history of the National Football League, and you were behind us then! I wanna thank you fans because you're behind us now! - Thank you very much. - (cheering) Green: Nick was not tall, but he was eight feet tall out on that football field 'cause he was so well respected. And when he spoke, his voice thundered, and the crowd was silenced, because he said, "I'm gonna change things. We're gonna change things." ♪ ♪ Once Marc got injured, Nick knew that was his life's mission. Within months, we raised millions of dollars, and we went out and recruited the number one neuroscience superstar in the world, Ake Sager from the Karolinska in Sweden. And we just went out, we said, who's the best in the world? And Nick said, I don't care what he costs, you get him here. And they said, there's no way he's gonna leave Sweden, but they hadn't met Nick Buoniconti. So, that's what happened, that's history. ♪ ♪ Narrator: Life for the Buonicontis had forever been altered. And while the goal of the Miami Project was to forge hope for breakthroughs in spinal cord research, there was still a sobering reality to confront. The 20-year-old Marc now had a new life as a quadriplegic to embark upon. It would take him eight months to get off a respirator, and over a year to come home. Marc: Well, getting off the respirator was a life-changer, and it was a motivating factor to just move forward. But in regards to my injury, I did go through a lot of the classical... emotional stages: denial, anger, depression, all those things. But I never accepted this injury. Marc: It's gonna happen. I mean, I will walk again. And everybody else, they will find us some kind of cure. And it's... I mean, it's not if, it's when. ♪ ♪ Narrator: Father was a regular presence at son's side in Miami, though Nick was also still working at US Tobacco's headquarters in Connecticut, albeit as a changed man. It wasn't long after Marc's accident that you began to see a change in Nick, and he became slightly softer around the edges. People were less afraid of him at work, and he elicited sympathy from a lot of people around him. I think part of the compassion that was new in Nick was that Nick had no idea how to cope with a tragedy that was this immense in his life, that had been such a golden life. And I think he was trying to decide, as an intellectual, how to deal with this. It was that profound to him. I think I changed for the better. When you have a focal point of your life, it changes dramatically. Having, uh... having... (sighs) Can't do it. Sorry. No sorrys. Buoniconti: You know, it's been almost a year from the day that I walked into a hospital room in Johnson City, Tennessee. When I looked at Marc... all I could see was a young boy struggling for his life. Narrator: Just how quickly the Miami Project's fundraising effort progressed was most evident when the organization held its first Greatest Sports Legend Dinner in New York City. Howard Cosell: I love Nick. I love the No-Name Defense. What happened to his son was tragic, and I will dedicate all of my remaining years, such as they may be, to helping Nick and Marc in whatever way I can. Narrator: The dinner, honoring iconic athletes and sports figures, became the Miami Project's annual showcase event, attracting luminaries from all across the public spectrum. We have problems, all of us think we got problems. You see these guys, and most people would just give up. But they don't give up, and they inspire us all to keep going, whatever happens. Gordon: When I think about us in those early days, raising money and getting commitments from celebrities, it was like being on Wall Street. At the end of the day, it was ding, ding, ding! And I used to put paper down and just show him what we'd gotten for this one and this one. He'd go, "You could've gotten more from him. That guy? That's all he gave?" You couldn't help be swept up with all this because it was his energy and it was Nick's vortex, and you either were in or you were out. And we were having... Nobody said no to us. It was the most remarkable thing. ♪ ♪ Buoniconti: I was concentrating so much on Marc, and that helped my demise at UST. Gordon: Nothing mattered but the Miami Project. Nothing mattered but Marc. And I think Lou Bantle recognized, and it was painful for a lot of us, that Nick ultimately would have to make a decision. Was his life about Marc, or was his life about the tobacco industry? We had just attained corporate... record corporate earnings and record sales. So, I thought, you know... I thought that my job was secure, but, uh, they voted me out. It was very... It was devastating for me. Narrator: His departure from US Tobacco at the end of 1989 did come with one silver lining. The company's insurance would continue to cover Marc's medical bills for the rest of his life. Meanwhile, Nick was still closely connected to football, thanks to the television job he'd now had for over a decade. Hello, everybody. Welcome to our 14th season of Inside the NFL. It promises... Narrator: And as the '90s began, a new face joined Nick and Len on the set: recently retired Cincinnati Bengals receiver Cris Collinsworth. And Chris, a little advice, you might benefit by listening to the old pros, particularly during the picks segment. My goodness! Are you serious? I've been watching that picks segment for the last couple of years and... do you guys even watch football games anymore? With the dartboard, is that what you're doing now? - It's really not very good. - Rookie, you are gonna make a bunch of mistakes during the year, and we old vets are gonna pick up for you. Collinsworth: You have to know, I was a Florida kid. I grew up watching Nick Buoniconti play for the Miami Dolphins, and the greatest team of all time, and undefeated, and... To work with him was a really big deal because I was a really big fan. I had no idea he didn't want me to work for him, but, you know, that's the way it works. Nick's a tough guy. Nick's a pit bull with everybody. I thought he just didn't like me. We'd sit in these meetings, everybody'd write down what they were supposed to say, and then we would read them. And so, every week, I would write out something, and I would read it, and Nick goes, "Oh, you can't say that. You know, "you're a former player. Come on, it's gotta... "it's gotta be tough. This has gotta be edgy. "That's what our show's about. What are you doing? You gotta write something." So I go, okay, Nick. Thanks for helping me. And I'd change it, you know... So then, I came in the next week, and it was the same thing. And it's like, "Ah, you gotta do something! The thing is, you know..." So, about week five, he comes in there again. He goes, "Ah, you can't say... You gotta say something tough and edgy. Come on, you know..." And I said, okay, I said, "I'll change mine," I said. "But nobody's gonna care about that piece of shit you just wrote over there." And the minute it came out of my mouth, I'm thinking, all right, I'm gonna have to use my jab effectively. Maybe, I'm a little longer than he is, you know. I'm gonna have to... 'Cause he's... We're definitely fighting. I'm thinking, well, if I could just wrestle him to the ground. You know, I'm literally thinking of how I'm gonna fight Nick Buoniconti. And he stops, and he kind of looks at me. And we never really had that issue again. It was almost like a defensive player, you had to stand up to it a little bit. And from that moment on, we were just kind of partners out there. Where is our Italian Stallion? I don't have any... Lenny, you gotta see this to be... (hums "Gonna Fly Now") Here he comes, the Italian Sta... Somebody call the paramedics! Get in here. Get in here. What's the matter with you? Never again. I could never run those steps. I'm not gonna do that again. You couldn't run them again. Catch your breath because I wanna talk about... Narrator: In a pre-Internet age, Inside the NFL was appointment viewing for fans between games every week. And Len and Nick remained at the center of the show's cast for 23 years. Though when they were replaced in 2002, it wasn't on Buoniconti's terms. I didn't understand it 'cause I wanted to make 25 years, you know? And, uh, it was, uh, it was bittersweet, you know? I understood that they were going younger. But, uh... I still believe that I had something to offer. He was crushed and mad. He was furious. I think it took some people some time to get him to realize, you did some incredible stuff for a long period. So, he finally realized. Probably forgave everybody. (chuckles) Collinsworth: When Len and Nick left the show, it was really hard on everybody. There was this great magical chemistry to the show, and... I knew it would never be the same. It was always fun and I loved everybody that I got a chance to work with on that show, but it was never the same as the original. You know, the original pairing... it was something special. ♪ ♪ Narrator: If leaving HBO was a disappointment, it came on the heels of one of the proudest moments of Buoniconti's life in 2001, when, after years of being passed over, pro football's ultimate honor finally came calling. Buoniconti: Oh my God. We were in Tampa for the Superbowl, and, uh, I found out that I made the Hall of Fame, and we cracked open a bottle of champagne and celebrated my induction. I was ecstatic about, about, uh... about being inducted as part of that No-Name Defense. Shula was more excited than I was that I made the Hall of Fame. I just was very, very happy. I couldn't have been more proud, and, uh, I just said, you know, it's finally happening. He's getting the recognition that he deserved. (applause) Collinsworth: There was something almost appropriate about Nick having to wait to get in the Hall of Fame. I can't even explain it. You know, you're sort of that underdog, undersized. Came out of the AFL, had to prove himself. He always believed he belonged in there. I knew he belonged in the Hall of Fame. But you almost had to see him play every single weekend to appreciate what that guy brought to the dance. ♪ ♪ Dad, a few years ago, you said, "Marc, "if I ever get elected to the Hall of Fame, I want you to introduce me." Well, here we are. (cheering) Marc: I would say that I wrote that speech probably over six months. And I wrote it and rewrote it. I probably changed it, probably, days before... my speech. Because I just, I wanted it to be right for him. I wanted it to be perfect for him. I mean, how many opportunities do you have to introduce your father into the Hall of Fame? You only have one. Dad, you never believed the labels and limitations others ascribed to you. Instead, you faced each challenge head-on and made believers out of them. Anderson: You could hear a pin drop when he started talking, and you could see the emotion between the father and the son. You know, it was unbelievable. I'm still emotional. Just because of what, um, they've done with the Miami Project, and what, you know, how it changed their lives so much. - (applause) - Who would've thought that the son of an Italian baker from the South End of Springfield, Massachusetts, would go on to run a Fortune 500 company. Or that a guy with a degree in Economics would be helping to make medical history. Or that a 13th round pick on the fledgling AFL would today be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame? Marc: I think the Hall of Fame award was more than just an award for his football accomplishments. I think it was a way to honor my dad for everything that he's ever done. Dad, you have always been by my side and have been more of a father to me than I could've ever imagined... the best father one could hope for. Whatever it is you got inside you, we see it, we feel it, and it gives each of us a little more reason to believe. Ladies and gentlemen, my hero, my friend, my dad, - Nick Buoniconti. - (cheering) It's very emotional. ♪ ♪ What he said blew me away. I just treasure that day. I'll always remember that day. You know, I wear this Superbowl ring, which is the only ring ever produced that says the Miami Dolphins were undefeated and were perfect. I would trade this ring in, and all my individual accomplishments, if one thing could happen in my lifetime. My son Marc dreams that he walks, and as a father, I would like nothing more than to walk by his side. Thank you so much. (applause) (sighs) ♪ ♪ Well, I'm feeling that, uh, somehow I have not fulfilled my dream of seeing Marc walk again, you know, and, uh, that's pretty sad. ♪ ♪ (projector whirring) Narrator: While Nick Buoniconti would be wildly venerated for his dedication as a father, as a husband, the story was different. And in 1997, he and Terry divorced /after 35 years together. (piano playing) Though a few years afterwards, he got a second chance at marriage. Lynn: I had heard of Nick Buoniconti long before I met him because when I used to come home from college, my father was the biggest Miami Dolphin fan ever. So, I would sit and watch every game with him, and hear every player on the team. ♪ ♪ When I met Nick and he introduced himself, he was very... "I'm Nick." And I said, "Do you have a last name?" And he said, "Yes. Buoniconti." And of course, I went back to 1972 with my dad. But what impressed me the most, even in that instant, is that I remembered reading about his relationship with his son. He made it quite clear right away that Marc was the number one priority in his life, and that his mission was to cure paralysis, and... Nick is very serious, so I took that very seriously. Buoniconti: Meeting Lynn was a new chapter in my life. Lynn was loving right from the beginning. I saw that very, very quickly in her, that she was a no-nonsense person who, uh, whose energy level was off the charts. And she used to play the piano every Sunday for... for me. And I used to sit there and read the New York Times while she played the piano. Lynn: Nick had retired from corporate life, but he was still on corporate boards, and he was still fundraising. In our downtime, we skied together, we played golf together, We traveled, and we just... thought that would go on forever. Buoniconti: I was looking forward to my golden years, which was playing golf every day, and traveling around the world. But I can't... I can't do that anymore because, uh, my brain won't let me. ♪ ♪ Lynn: I think the first signs were about 2013, when I started noticing differences in Nick: his impatience, his attention span, his driving. I became more highly aware of something wasn't right. After I saw those signs, I was more on high alert for things. And he would come home from the golf course and he'd be covered in bandages. And I would ask him what happened. And he would say, "Oh, I fell over a wall. The wall... I don't think the wall was there before." He wouldn't remember a conversation. He wouldn't remember where he was that morning. Wouldn't remember a golf shot. Wouldn't remember who he played golf with that day. Narrator: And so, the Buonicontis traveled across the country, searching for answers over the next four years. Specialists would tell them that Nick was suffering from dementia and shrinkage on the right side of his brain. But seeking more clarity, in the fall of 2017, they met with Dr. Ann McKee. McKee: When Nick and Lynn came to see me in Boston, they had a lot of questions about what was going on with Nick. And they'd been to a lot of different centers and gotten different opinions, and I think they were fairly confused at that point about what the possibilities were. They'd seen me on television. It was during a congressional hearing, where we were talking about what we've accomplished over the last decade in CTE. And, uh, that really piqued their interest, and they wanted to come talk to me, and see if we thought that CTE was something that was going on in Nick. ♪ ♪ Narrator: CTE, the irreversible degenerative disease caused by repetitive brain trauma. McKee: CTE cannot be diagnosed definitively until after death, but during life, you can suspect CTE. Nick had a long-playing career in football. He had many, many years of exposure to those repetitive head hits, and over time, decades of play, they can have a very serious effect on the brain. And for me, the way Nick appeared, his history, his MRI, everything was consistent with CTE. You're hoping that it's something that isn't gonna continue to get worse. But that's not the news we had for them. Narrator: But just as he'd done decades earlier, Buoniconti refused to simply accept the devastating news without a fight. ♪ ♪ He joined forces with Boston University and the Concussion Legacy Foundation, to start the Nick and Lynn Buoniconti CTE Research Fund, and announced that upon his death, he would donate his brain for study. I would like to thank my wife Lynn for being... supportive of me. (crying) This is not easy. It's difficult. I'm not half the man I used to be. It didn't surprise me that Nick wanted to be vocal about trying to help others because that's what he's done his whole life. That's just who Nick is. Buoniconti: It was an easy decision. Whatever they do to my brain, I hope it helps the players in the future. I'm positive that football caused this, but I'm not mad at the game. I'm mad at the owners. I... think what we did, we paved the way for... for the NFL being what it is today. In other words, uh... we paved the way for them, and they're reaping all the benefits. Sorry. I'm not, uh, I'm not, uh, coherent. ♪ ♪ Narrator: If he points his anger at the leagues' owners for not giving more funds to help ailing retired players, it's still another complication in the long relationship between the man, who got so much from football, and the game, that in the years since, has seemed to take so much away. Buoniconti: It would've been a totally different life without football. Without football, I probably would've joined my father in the bakery business. Football opened up every door I could imagine. It helped me go to law school. It helped me go to Notre Dame. And it, it helped me in the corporate life, too. I loved it, you know. I always loved it. Still do. But, you know, um, I'm paying the price. Marc: When we were growing up, football gave everything to us. And then, look what it did to me. And now, look what it's doing to him. I mean, do you love the game? Do you hate the game? Do you love it and hate it? ♪ ♪ - (chattering) - Here comes Nicky. - Man 1: There he goes. - Man 2: Hey, Nick. Hi, let's go! Man: How much money you got on you? (indistinct chattering) So, we're still looking at all the bags. - Hey, kiddo. - How you doing, Gene? - That was the funniest times of all times. - Good. Good seeing you. - Okay, you ready to stand? - Yeah. Man: We're putting for big money today. - Oh. - Pull him up. (chuckles) Give you a hand here. You can't putt unless it's for money. - Yeah. - I can't putt anyway. - We never heard those words. - Watch, it's gonna go right in. A little short. One more try. Let's go. Buoniconti: People can see that I'm not the person I used to be. - Yeah! - There it is! - (laughing) - See? Buoniconti: I take, probably, 20 pills a day, and, uh, that's not an exaggeration. I have a caregiver 24 hours a day. And it's difficult when you have all your freedoms stripped from you. I think Marc is amazing that he's able to put up with being paralyzed so many years. We're both, in a way, paralyzed. I'm paralyzed because I can't do the basic things in life. It's not pleasant to think about where my life is gonna take me, you know? Lynn: We've never spoken about how much time he has. 'Cause I think we're both living the new norm every week, and just I'm still trying to cram as much of our old life as I can into every moment that we have. I can't think about not being without him because even... even the way it is now, he's still here, you know. And, um, he might not be the same, but we've been together for so long. When you're with someone for so long, and you love them so much, it's hard to think about without. ♪ ♪ (sighs) ♪ ♪ Death is final. So, you hang onto, you hang on with your fingernails to every last minute, and make every minute count. ♪ ♪ Narrator: For more than three decades now, the moments that have been among the most significant have come at scenes like these, at the still thriving annual Greatest Sports Legends Dinners. (indistinct chatter) You know Brian Boitano. Hi, Brian Boitano. How are you? Narrator: The dinners have anchored Buoniconti's extraordinary success as a fundraiser, helping to raise more than half a billion dollars, and making the Miami Project the most comprehensive spinal cord research facility in the world. Bob Costas: Ladies and gentlemen, it's now my honor to introduce the inspiration for the Miami Project, and the Buoniconti Fund, Marc Buoniconti. (applause) Marc: Lives are changed in a split second. Families are devastated, and loved ones are crying out for help. The Miami Project brings real hope to countless individuals and families who depend on us to find a cure. Green: This project has changed the way we practice medicine. People come into our hospital every week who would've been paralyzed, and are walking now because of hypothermia, because of some of the pharmaceutical protocols, clinical trials we're doing. Women with spinal cord injury and men with spinal cord injury are having their own babies because of the basic science research done here. Is everybody cured? No. Have we accomplished our final goal? No. But we're really at a point where we are pushing... pushing that line hard, every day. ♪ ♪ The world's changed a lot, and in no small part, due to the Buonicontis, and their relentless pursuit for all the things that are important to people who are still sitting in those wheelchairs. Collinsworth: Nick will be remembered for... the right things. For taking on challenges. For not being afraid. For being so brutally honest with friends and family and people that, sometimes, it hurt. (applause) Nick has slugged his way through a lot of tough stuff, and he did it without bowing. He did it with dignity. He did it with tenaciousness that I don't know anybody else that really falls into that category. And I'm not sure life offers a whole lot more than that. You know? You get your time and you go fistfight your way through it, and at the end of the day, you say, that was me. Put a stake in the ground. "That was me." And that's Nick Buoniconti. Kroft: I view his life as a triumph and not as a tragedy. In spite of it all, and the way that... the way this seems to be coming to an end for him, uh, is sad. He's done so many things. He's had a remarkable life. He's changed things, you know? He's changed things. I think he changed people's perceptions about athletes. I think he, uh, showed that you can... a football player can go to law school, and come out and eventually run a major corporation. And he showed that he can be on a television show for 23 years. And that, when called upon, he was... he rose to the occasion to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to try and help his son and other people that suffer from paralysis. I don't think that anybody in sports has ever raised the kind of money that Nick has raised for the Miami Project. ♪ ♪ Buoniconti: How you doing, buddy? Nick III: There he is. How's everything?

He's a street fighter from Springfield, Massachusetts. And that's what got him where he was. Well, it looks like... the final chapter in my professional life has been written. It was a challenge.

I mean, I think my brother's... that ship has probably sailed, but there's still so much possibility of helping people.
