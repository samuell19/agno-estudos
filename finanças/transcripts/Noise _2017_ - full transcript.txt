We're all the same. Thank you so much for coming! Hello! Hey, you're Yama-chan! Thank you! - I came again. - It's so good to see you! What's wrong? You look tired. Did something bad happen? Let's forget about it all and take a snap! - Okay, then! - Great! Thank you! Let's pose. Here we go, cheese. Thank you. I'll write a message. What's bothering you? Can't you say? I guess we all have problems. Come see me if you want to talk, okay? I'll be waiting. Thank you. Thanks, see you! Bye. Can we talk? - How old are you? - 17. 17? You look so matured. I'm a scout, you see. I'd like to offer you a job. Would you be interested? Whoa, you're so cute. We kind of have this cute-girl only policy. But don't worry it’s a safe job.

But it's not my fault! Masahiro said he'd win us some money. He needed 100,000 yen for the horses. So I just borrowed 100,000 yen. But in 2 months, my debt became 2 million. Can you believe that? They're such thugs. Why did this happen to me? Your dad left us in the lurch. I'm tired of this. But I've thought it over. I want us to be happy again. But to do that we need money. Don’t you want to start over again, Ken? I do. Yeah. I do, too. Really? Thank you. But we need money to do it. Can you call your dad? I can't do that. I'm not exaggerating. This isn't a joke! If we don't show them that we can pay by tomorrow... they’re going to kill us. You met them. They're insane. You're just like your father the way you shut down. Unless we show them we can pay, they're going to kill us. Don't worry. I'll take care of it myself. No. You need it, too. Thank you. Is this it? Yeah. But you got paid more than this. No, I wasn't. Did you spend it on something? No. Thank you. See you, Ken. Ken. Bye. "Perpetrator of Akihabara Massacre senteneed to execution" Misa! Misa! Misa! Where were you? Where were you? Where were you? Why were you late? Stop it! Stop it! Explain to your mom why you were late. Why do I have to? Do it! Shut up! Shut up! Don't speak to your father like that! Huh!? Who do you see in me? Who the hell do you see in me? Beating people up! What does it do for you? Do you want to end up like your mother? Look at your mom and say it. From now on... Louder! From now on...

Sorry, I'm gonna call you back... Hey, Takuya, Wait! I was thinking of introducing Misa to a bigger company. What's wrong? I need some time. I thought you'd agree with me. She'll get more exposure in a bigger company and earn more money, too. I know that. But is that the best thing for her? Misa isn't your property, you know. That's not it. It's just that I don't believe fame is everything. Like those people on TV. They're putting on a show to become popular. I don't think Misa is up to that. Excuse me. I’m Mizoguchi from Kaino Real Estate. Is Mrs. Ohashi here? I'm Mizoguchi from Kaino Real Estate. Hi, I'm Mizoguchi. Is Mrs. Ohashi home? She's not here right now. Are you her son? Yes.

I was sure you'd say yes, so I've already spoken to the production company. You have? I’m sorry. You've let me down. Never mind. It can't be helped. I'll talk to the owner and the company. But you know what that means? You understand, right? Get it sorted for me. Your mother is months late with the rent. No, we've paid! - No. you haven't. - We've been paying. I'm here because you haven’t paid. We have paid. It's a mistake. You haven't paid. That's why we're having this conversation. I've spoken to Mrs. Ohashi about this. You have to comply with her wishes. I haven't heard anything. I'm sorry. It's a done deal and you have to leave. - I'll check with her. - Can you do that? - I'll try. - Can you try now? - I'll do it later. - We can't reach her at all. - I'll contact her later. - You can’t reach her either, right? Her number's been canceled. Look, you have to leave today, but you didn't know, right? You can’t pay today, can you? How much? 240,000 yen for the last 3 months. But as your landlord doesn't trust you now... Could you pay next month's rent upfront? Today. Okay. - Can you do it? - Yes. Forgive me for asking, but what is your occupation? Does that matter? I need to know you're able to pay. You're already behind... I’ll pay! Yes. but what if you don't? - What's your job? - Does it matter? Yes. I said I'll pay! Well, can you prepare it now? I’ll pay later. When is later? It has to be today. You're supposed to leave today. I'm glad you're willing to pay. But I can't trust an empty promise. You can pay today? Later on. When’s later? - Contact me once... - You want to know my job? I'm a delivery man. I see. Are you full-time? No. - Part-time? - Yes. - You don’t have 320,000 yen now, right? - Not now. - Can you get it? - Yes, I can. Well, alright, then. Can you contact me on this number when you’ve made the payment? Alright. I'll speak with the landlord after you call me. Okay. Bye. We haven't finished yet. If you can pay. I'll take it into account that you didn't know. But if you can't pay. I'll give you three days to leave. - It's a deal. then. - Yes. If you can pay today, please contact me. If you can’t, please leave within 3 days. Alright, then. Also, you can leave any furniture you don’t need. But leave within 3 days. Welcome home. Rie. Don't eat that junk. I made dinner for you. Rie! Rie! Alright. Let’s eat. Bon appetit. Put your phone down and eat. You love fried chicken, right? So... how's school? I’ve got something to tell you. My work isn’t as hectic anymore. So why don't we go for a drive sometime? Hey. I told you to put down your phone while you eat. Rie! Rie! Wait. Where are you going? What are you doing? What's this? -Who's this'? So many little hearts. What is it? Who is it? This blonde looks a lot like me. Who is this? Answer me. All these hearts... You’re distrusting! I'm leaving. Hey! Wait. Rie! - Takahashi. - Yeah? - What about our deal? - Erm. I'm sorry.

You can always walk home. I need some change for the train. I said walk home! You better have more next time. I'm sorry. "Takuya" What happened? You can’t go home? I see. Did you have a fight with your parents? I left home. Poor thing. It'll be alright. Okay? We have a dorm, too. Let's go to the office. It’s cold out here. Let's go. You can tell me what happened. Good work at the gig. Thanks for the support. - What's up? - Sorry. The thing is... I've got something important I need to tell you. Tell me. what kind of idol you want to be? It's difficult for someone like you to become popular, you know. We've been through a lot together already. And I want to keep seeing you grow. To put it simply... There’s a guy who wants to give you a chance. And he's taken a liking to you. You know where I'm getting at? Of course it’s your decision. Takahashi. I understand. What's been stolen from me? What have I stolen? Have I forgotten a little at a time? Is it me or this world that's been soiled? Whatever... Open your eyes! Reality's driving me insane. What's been stolen from me? What have I stolen? Have I forgotten a little at a time? Is it me or this world that's been soiled? 8 years ago from today... I'd drunk too much the night before and had slept untill noon. I'd drunk too much the night before and had slept untill noon. I woke up and I thought of going to Akihabara like usual by train... But then I saw news of the Akihabara Massacre on my phone. If you hadn't been drunk, you would have been in Akihabara at that time, right? That's right. How do you feel about that? I could have easily been stabbed. I could have been a victim. - It was pure chance you weren't there. - That's right. That’s cute! Raise the reflector board! That's great! Tilt your body a little to the side. Your face this way. Good, good, that’s lovely! Can I take a look? What do you think? Can you make her look a little more sexy? Turn your body to the rear and show the camera your face. That's beautiful. Good job. Hello? Oh hey, Yamazaki. We just finished. Rie's a great find. Is she there? Do you want a word? Rie. It’s Yamazaki. Hello? Was it fun? Yes. it was. I felt like a celebrity. You are a celebrity! Everyone was impressed. Thank you. I'm counting on you. Yes. This train is bound for Tsudanuma. Next stop is Akihabara. The exit will be on your left. Short hair suits you. Really? Thank you. - Let's use it to create your image. - Nobody’s said that to me before. - You're an adorable Lolita-type. - Thank you. How tall are you? I'm 152 cm. I’ve been looking for a girl like you for years. Really? Okay. Come on in. It's a bit of a mess, though. "Audition Hall" Next up? Entry Number 11. Misa. I applied to this audition because, erm... I lost my mom in the Akihabara Massacre. And I thought maybe if I become an idol... I could see her again. That's why I'm here. Would you mind elaborating on how and why it happened? It was uncalled for. I didn’t deserve what my dad did to me. But my mom didn’t do anything wrong. And she died because of a bunch of things she didn’t deserve. Akihabara is the center of young female idols, right? So if I pass this audition and become am idol... I feel like... maybe I could meet her again, you know? Why don't you want to avoid Akihabara? Well, I feel as if she's still here somehow. Although I haven't been able to visit it yet... the place where she died. You have beautiful legs. Such great style. Thank you. Let me see your behind. Amazing. Your legs will make you famous. Really? You’re so soft. I just need to go to the bathroom. Bathroom? But why? Girls need to prepare, you know? Okay. I'll be back soon. You're back. Yeah. You took so long. I'm sorry. Are you ready? Yes. I'm fine now. You like that? Let's take this off. I need to take your measurements. You're so sexy. A real turn on. Hey... Mmm? Please.. Please stop! -We're just getting started. Stop! Please stop! Stop! Stop! I'm sorry. What the hell are you sorry about? I'm busy fucking her. It felt good, right? Why are you sorry? You said you'd let me fuck her. You asshole. You really can’t do anything, can you? Misa. What are you looking at? Don't get in my way! Kaori! Why were you even born? Where are you going? Get off me! What the hell? Did you set me up? This is Manseibashi Police Station. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? What do you mean, hello? I called a few days ago. You think this is some kind of joke, huh? I’m really doing this. I'm going to bomb all of you and start slashing people. Do you get it? What are you planning to do? I’m going to slash people with a knife. And make an explosion. It’s simple. Where are you right now? None of your business! Please calm down. What do you mean calm down, what do you know? Why do you need to do such a thing? Why does that matter, do I need a reason? I don't know why you're planning to do this. Of course you wouldn’t. Are you taking the piss? What is the purpose of this? Purpose? Do I need one? I just want to do it. You're still young,.. So what? Does that matter? Harness your anger another way. Sure, I'm angry, that’s why I am doing this. No, I don't think that's it. Why does it even matter to you? People aren’t that simple. They are simple, what do you mean? What do you even know about me? Tell me. Can you tell me what happened to you? Why does that matter to you? My parents are gone. I have a debt. I got kicked out of my apartment. And still. I have to live on. But only after I kill a lot of people. Why don't you try and stop me, huh? You sound like a nice young man. What do you know? How could you understand? You fuckers, you don’t understand anything! You know nothing about me! You still have a bright future. I have no future. That’s why I’m calling! I’m calling because there isn’t! Please listen to me, young man. I know there's hope. Misa! Misa! Misa, when’s your next day off from work? Tell me. - Why'? - I want to take you somewhere. - When's your next day off? - What are you talking about? - Let's go... - Can’t you see it’s too late? I... I just wanted us to... It’s your fault mom died! I want to go to Akihabara with you. Let’s go meet your mother. Shut up! Won’t you go with me? Why would I ever go with you? You were beating her since I was small. Why would I go with you? Don't take the piss. You should have died instead of her! You should have died! Forget it. You bastard. Betting on the horses all the time. What's that got to do with it? That's got nothing to do with anything. Thanks to that money, you were able to eat. Did you heat it up? Don’t touch me! Where's your mom's spoon? Eat it, you bastard. Eat! Knock it off. Stop doing that shit! I told you not to smoke. I'll quit. I won't quit betting though. You get back late these days. What's that to you? What kind of job are you doing? You've got no right to tell me what to do. You're busy at the weekend? Why do you want to go to Akihabara? I'm asking you why you want to go? I went a couple of days ago. It's been a while... You heard about the execution? It made me want to go. I went alone. What’s wrong? Misa? Misa! - Subtitle by cire79 -
