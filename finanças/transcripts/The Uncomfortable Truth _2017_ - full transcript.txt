- You'll arrive at the pickup point in approximately five minutes. Our agents in the Caribbean are depending on you, so remember to handle the package with extreme care. Wilson, you and Martin will make your way through the front, Beckett, you will cover the back. - Yes, sir. - All right, let's kick it. Is that some Wonder Woman bullshit I hear, Martin? - No, sir. - You're responsible for your team members. Steady yourself and serve the mission. - Yes, sir. My next contact will be in 30 minutes. - Copy that, out. Now that's a good look for you. - Bite me. - Shit. Shit. This is great. Sam, what the hell are you doing? I thought you, I told you to stay at your post. You know that's a bullshit assignment. I know what I'm doing, Nana, check this out. This is great, look at this shit. Control. Control, the package will not be delivered. I repeat, the package will not be delivered. What do we have here? Connor, it's a trap. - Shit, retreat. - Darryl. Abort, abort, abort. Come on, move, move, move. Let's go, get out of there, Sam, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Sam! Sam, no. Sam! - I can't believe that I'm gonna be a free woman for two whole weeks. This weekend, I am gonna have some serious relaxation. - Well, I know the kids are at camp, right? What about Nate? - Back to back trade shows. Everything that you ever wanted to know about RV rentals. Sounds like fun. Loads. - What are you gonna do with your new found freedom? I'm gonna read a romance novel, all the way through without interruption. I'm gonna watch TV without channel surfing, and if I'm really ambitious, I'm gonna work my tan. What about you? Have you heard anything? - Well, yeah. They sent me my walking papers, no pun intended, of course. But a nice little pension. - I'm sorry. I know that's not what you wanted to hear. But civilian life is not that bad. You are better off without them. - Yeah, but will they be better off without me? Can I get you ladies anything else? - Get out of my way. - Call 911. Can I have a refill? Do you want anything? - Got it. - Gentlemen, as luck would have it, we're going stateside after all. Here's your passports. Pack it up. We leave tonight. - I can assure you, Mr. McDowell, that the 23 years of experience, one moment. - Excuse me, Mr. Vaughn, your 11 o'clock is here. - Fine, tell him I'll be right with him. - It's a she. - Whatever. As I was saying, Fortress leads the nation in corporate security. - I wouldn't be here if you didn't. - And with Chem Co's recent contract with the government, well, disposing of chemical weapons can interest a lot of dangerous people. - Exactly, and that's why I'd like you and your team to come onto our facility and evaluate our current security system. - Certainly. There is one thing, and it's really something I have to ask, as I mentioned before, there are a lot of people who would love to get their hands on the chemicals weapons you'll be disposing of, so my question to you, Mr. McDowell, is how much money would it take for you to look the other way? - Mr. Vaughn, there isn't that much money in the world. - Good. That's exactly the kind of answer I needed to hear. I'll have our secretary set up a time for the inspection. - Good, I'll see you soon. - Yes, sir. - Mr. Vaughn. What? Sam Martin. - Right. Please, come in. You're interested in our headquarters security management position. - That's right. - I think that's great. Let's take a look. You have an expert rating in a wide variety of weapons. That's very impressive. When were you handicapped? - I was injured in the line of duty. It was a while ago, so I'm perfectly capable of... - No doubt. - Doing anything. - As you may know, Fortress has a reputation for providing the very best corporate security available for both the firms and their executives. See, many times, there will be volatile situations. It must be handled quickly and with deadly force. - Well, if you'll notice, my training and expertise are in those types of circumstances. As a matter of fact, I'm... - I can see that yes. The security manager's position is critical for two reasons, first this is a cut throat industry. The security manager must guard against competitor espionage at all times. - If you'll notice... - Second, when clients visit Fortress, our image and skill level must be well represented. - I understand... - Great. I'm glad to hear that. Nice meeting you. I'm sure we'll be in touch. - Great. - Susan, get Howard on the phone. - Yes, sir, right away, sir. - Howard. I thought I told you I only wanted to see the five most qualified candidates. Really? What about Samantha Martin? Are you kidding? Look, I don't have time for this. If you can't... Then get it right. One, two, three. 15. - One, two, three. 16. - One, two, three. 17. - Manard, take over. 18. One, two, three. 19. - Go, pick it up, Felton. - One, two, three. 20. - You're beginning to sound like Madison. That hurts. How you doing? - Good, how are you doing? One, two, three. One, two, three. Four. - Felvin, get off your face. God, these guys are killing me, bunch of wimps. One, two, three. - But you were tough. - Were, still am tough. Went to Fortress today. - To corporate boys? I know 'em. How'd it go? - Like shit. After 10 years in the agency, people still can't get past the chair. - Yeah, I know what you mean, I'm not exactly working in the field, either, at least the agency gave you your pension. - I don't want a pension. I want a job. One, two, three. - If you hear of anything, would you? - I'll give you a call. - Thanks. Maybe you should come over, you know? I'll make dinner. - I've had your cooking, remember? Yeah. Well, we could order pizza. - Okay. - All right, good. That'll be good. - One, two, three. - Two. - One, two, three. - Three. - One, two. - So when did you start painting? In rehab. The they told me it would be good therapy. It looks like you could use a therapist. - Hey. They expel all my demons. I mean, I think they're very Anne Rice esque. - That's one way to put it. So how's your love life? - Not as good as your romance novels. - Are you seeing anyone special? - Vicky, it's Friday night and I'm sitting here eating pizza with you. - Good because I saw Eric last week. - What'd you do, go visit him in prison? - No, he's home early, good behavior. Something like that. - That certainly doesn't sound like Eric. - He asked about you. And he was just wondering how you were doing? And I think that he's still in love with you. - I turned him in. - He knew what you did for a living. I think that he just wanted to get caught. Yeah, embezzling is so tiresome. - Everybody makes mistakes, Sam. He paid for his. Yeah, well so did I. - I gave him your phone number. Are you crazy? - He wants to see you. - Does he know about this? - Yes. - Probably just feels sorry for me. - No, I think you've got that job filled. - Fortress Incorporated, can you hold? Fortress Incorporated, can you hold? Fortress Incorporated, may I help you? Yes, one moment, I'll check that line. - Excuse me, I was talking to Mr. Vaughn last week about the security manager... - Can I help you? Yes, I was inquiring about the security manager. - That's me. - Really? - You caught me on my first day here, but if you don't mind waiting a few minutes, I'll get some forms for you to fill out and we'll determine the level of protection that you require. - How long have you been in the security business? - Fortress has been in the security protection business for years. My background is in law enforcement. - What exactly does your training consist of? - The academy and my own martial arts regimen. Don't worry, you'll be safe as long as Fortress is protecting you. I have no doubt that I'm in capable hands, especially in this building. You must have a massive security system. It's state of the art. If you like, I'll take you on a tour. - Love to. - I'm sorry, Sam. - They are so asinine. I should teach them a lesson. - I'm sure you'll think of something. - I already have. I know that look. - What was the name of that strange little guy that re-wired your security system? - You mean Feud. - Feud. - I think your evaluation of our security system was right on the money. We're gonna need you to fill in the gaps. - Mr. McDowell, you'll not be disappointed. Fortress will work hand and hand with your own people. We'll turn your company into the safest in the nation. - I'm counting on that. - Vicky says you've been busy lately. Busy doing what? Enrolling. - Enrolling in what? - Schools. I can't seem to stay in them. Why is that? - They keep kicking me out. Probably, probably has something to do with the fact that I'm smarter than all the professors. They find that kind of irritating. And I've given up on the whole college route. I'm working on the trade school thing now. - So, what do we want to be when we grow up? - Interested. In anything. - Get bored easily, do we? - Yep. As a matter of fact, I'm starting to get bored right now. - Is that why you rigged your professor's chair to catapult him across the room? - I was trying to make a point? - Okay well then what was the point when you painted the new slogan on the campus water tower every night? - I see you've done your homework into some of my extra-curricular activities. So are you part of some scholastic behavioral committee or am I here for a reason? - I have a little project I need some help with. I'm looking to hire a creative thinker, to help me engineer some tools for my trade. - What sort of project? - Let's just say that I need to make a point. ♪ Makes me feel I can be found ♪ Makes me feel ♪ Makes me feel ♪ So I come without you ♪ I am waiting for the next big thing ♪ ♪ Bringing on quick time to me ♪ I tap my fingers to the same old thing ♪ ♪ Dream of better things to see ♪ ♪ I can't tell you ♪ Apart becomes my name - Or just cameras, here, here, and here. - Okay. This, this. Will freeze up the image on their monitors. It should give you about 10 seconds to pass each area. - Cool. Okay. Infrared here, right here. It's off when the cleaning crew is working, which should give me about 20 minutes. I think that should be a breeze. - Do you want me to get that? - No, the machine will pick it up. This is Sam, you know the drill. Samantha, I guess you're not there. It's Eric. I was kind of hoping I would get the machine. It's a little easier that way, kind of. Anyway, I just wanted to hear your voice. I hope you're doing okay. I'll call you later, bye. - Do you wanna take a break? - No. No, let's keep going. - Okay, so Friday, most people should clear out by say, six. When does the cleaning crew arrive? Well, that's 6:30, seven. - And you just wanna... - Absolutely. - Waltz through the front? - I think if you're going to make a point, it should sting a little. - What was, what did you say in that letter? I told Vaughn that his lack of consideration of my abilities was shortsighted and that those kinds of decisions can be costly. I also said that as we face the millennium, discrimination is gonna take a backseat to justice. What does that mean? - I have no idea. It just sounded good at the time. Fortunes say never bite off more than you can chew. - Never underestimate a woman who's been trained to kill. - I'll remember that. - It's probably a good idea. One, two. Go ahead and start, guys, I'll be right in. - Yes, absolutely, that's right. I'll get a hold of him. Get confirmation today. We're on schedule. Look let me call you back on a secure line. When we know the transportation are out. Is that good enough? It doesn't give us enough time. Look, dammit, chemical weapons are delicate. What? If they even suspect you, we'll all be compromised. Okay, fine. Fine. I'm sending it to you right now. - Night, Mr. Vaughn. Good night. Hey, Grace, we're done out here. Okay, I have to do Mr. Vaughn's office. Go ahead and set the alarm. I'll fix it in here. - Look, I admit that that seems odd, but I don't know where you're going with this. I mean, did you actually see the computer screen? - No. Well, did you get the disc? - No. - Well, did you hear anything substantial? Substantial or suspicious? - Substantial. - No, but, you know me. You know that I wouldn't be here unless I felt in my gut that something was wrong. - Your gut is not always accurate. Remember Prague? - But Prague was different. - Look, you're sure that you're not reading more into this than there actually is? You know, filling a void or something? - I'm telling you that something isn't right. - All right, I'll poke around and see what I can dig up on Fortress. This Vaughn, okay? - Okay. - In the meantime, you stop looking for conspiracies. There's enough of that out there already. I'm sure Mr. Vaughn is harmless. - Now you'll see why I installed the new cameras for your interior office surveillance. Now showing a thief caught in the act. In her final performance. - We could press breaking and entering charges. - I didn't hire you for being in law enforcement. I hired you for being kicked out. You're gonna handle this problem, permanently. - Thanks. Maybe you should see a doctor. - A doctor's not what I need right now. - All right. Let's say that this has something to do with Fortress and Chem Co. Now, dealing in chemical weapons is not something that you just pick up as a sideline. You gotta work up to serious shit like that. - Well, who says Fortress hasn't? - What do you want me to do? I checked them out. They came out clean. This guy, Vaughn, isn't exactly a saint, but he's not a criminal either. - Not yet. Look, just push Madison, will you? - He won't buy it. - Just do it. Please. - All right. The guy hates me. Hate's kind of a strong word. - Yeah, but accurate. Look, you wanna stay here? - No, thanks. I've found someplace they won't find me. Don't let me down, okay? - Never have. - Okay. Thanks. - Dante. You've been briefed? - Yes, my men and I are ready. As you as you deposit our fee. - Don't worry, I'll take good care of it. - So what did he do? I mean, do you think that you're safe here? For tonight. Hey, Feud, thanks for coming. - What are we gonna do, toilet paper Vaughn's house now? - That stunt we played at Fortress has made life a lot more difficult. - I'll say. - Look, I've got some work for you to do. - I'm game. - Okay, good, but first I've got this computer of Vicky's and I'm not a hacker. Do you know one? - No. No, no, no, there's no eating in here. This is a new couch. Sam, tell him. - Well? - I can do that. - By tomorrow? - By breakfast. - Go for it. Eric? What are you doing here? - Vicky says you need a hacker. Okay, I'm into Fortress, but their encryption program is pretty intense. - Meaning? - Meaning it's gonna take some time. - Isn't this violating your parole or something? - What are you gonna do, arrest me again? - Very funny. I just don't think this is a good idea. - No, you see, embezzling 25 million dollars from the Demoney family, that wasn't a very good idea. Besides, I was looking for an excuse to see you again. You know, you look great. Look, I know we've had our problems, but I learned two things when I was in prison. One, you wouldn't have put me there if you didn't want to protect me, and two, patience. Got it. - What? - This definitely violates my parole. - Donuts? Anyone? - Move over, let me see. - Don't. - Why not? - Because in this case, ignorance is bliss. Would you please make a couple copies of this for me? Feud, let's get everything together, we're leaving. - Hey, what's going on? - This has just become a lot more dangerous and I don't want you involved any more than you already are. - But I... - Will you please just trust me? - So where are you gonna stay? - I know a place. - Gonna have it. This is where, good for down and out of sights. Yeah, it's dark in here. Careful. - You okay? - Yes. - At least he's still paying his electric bill. - Yeah. He probably has so much money, he doesn't even think about stuff like that. ♪ It's a dream for me ♪ That is waiting patiently ♪ For when push comes to shove ♪ Which it usually does for me ♪ It's only a two way explain ♪ More than any ways to gain ♪ They sneak up behind you ♪ And start your mind for free - Okay. I'm in. What, now, this is only secondary access. We won't be able to get far from here? - Don't worry about it. All I need for you to do is access the agency pitcher files, and then just find me anybody's who's been pensioned over the last couple years that live nearby. - Okay, you got it. - You don't have to do this, you know? - And you do? - Yeah. - Then so do I. - Okay, so, what's next? - I'm gonna go talk to Conner, and then I think you... - Don't even think of trying to talk me out of working with you on this thing. - Look, this is not a game. This is not a school prank. This is real life, and potentially real death. - You need me. And I'm not leaving. Conner. - Hey, what's going on? - Did you speak to Madison yet? - Tomorrow, why? - It's not enough to convict but it's enough to know that I'm right. - Wait a second, where are you going? - Watch your back. Where are you gonna be? - Yo, are you the lady of the house? Gotta very special offer just for you. Yeah? I got your offer right here. Angel Lawrence. Why do I recognize that name? He was an expert marksman and infiltration specialist. And his partner got killed, right? - Hello, may I inquire, are you the lady of the house? Tremendous. I have a lovely offer for you today. Madame, when is the last time you had your carpet steam cleaned? - No one wanted to be his partner. They said he was erratic and sometimes has multiple personalities. Now he spends all his time flying ultra lights, arrested twice for buzzing pedestrians. - It's a real hot dog, isn't he? But if you think he's something, wait till you see the next guy?

Well, cheers. Relax. They won't kill you. There is a reason why we're here, right? - What do you think you're doing, hitting up on my woman. You son of a bitch. - Fuck off! - There he is. Mo Cooper. Awarded three times for bravery in the field. He's an explosives expert with extensive weapons training. You're gonna love this part. He specialized in chemical weapons. - You okay? - Anyway, he was injured in the line of duty, June '96, an explosion shattered his ear drums. He lost about 40% of his hearing. - Let me take out the trash. - Since then, he's been living on his pension and working odd jobs, mainly as a bouncer. What do you think, like him? - Where did you get this? - Sam Martin. - How'd she? - I never asked. You know her, she's pretty resourceful. I want you to put me on that transport. - Impossible, that's highly classified. - Sir, some of the information on that disc is classified and the only way that Fortress can get their hands on it, is if it were leaked from the inside. - Possibly. - Probably. Look, somebody's already tried to kill Sam once. She came to me because I'm her partner. She trusts me. - I'll have more qualified personnel handle the matter. Besides, you no longer work in the field. - And why is that? - I don't have to justify my decision to you, Sam, or God Almighty. Your job is to do what I tell you to do. - And your job? - My job is to make sure that whoever I send out in the field has a high probability of coming back alive. If I were to put you in that transport, I wouldn't be doing my job. - And if I'm not on that truck, you and I both know that Sam will be, one way or another. - We have company. - Who's this? - That's Feud. He's one of us. - Nice to meet you. - Told you. - You okay? - Loaded. So what's going on? - We're waiting for one more. - Thanks for coming. Nice little fixer upper. Everybody, this is... Angel. - No. - So, you two know each other, that's great. - Yeah. I never forget a traitor. - What was that? I couldn't hear you. - Have you got anymore of your partners killed? - I did not get my partner killed. - No, you just left your son, out completely exposed and without backup. - Stop it, both of you. - Bastard, you weren't there. - That's right, 'cause if I was, you'd be dead. - I don't know what kind of baggage you're carrying, but you take it outside, keep it outside and sit down. - Agent Samuels Madison. Is your team assembled? Good, you have your orders. Keep it simple. Steady yourselves and serve the mission. Good luck. Our next contact will be in 48 hours. - Mo, Angel, we've asked you here today because we need your help. Your expertise. We found that Fortress is not only in corporate security, but into black market arm sales as well. Eric. - Mo, could you get the light for me, please? - This is Lamont Vaughn, CEO of Fortress. The latest client, Chem Co, has been contracted by the government to dispose of chemical weapons confiscated during various black op campaigns in the Middle East. Now this Fortress Chem Co connection in and of itself is unimportant, but we discovered that there is a mole inside the agency, and connections to either a terrorist organization or mercenaries acting as a go between with a foreign buyer. Either way, it's a problem. Now this is Brian McDowell. He's CEO of Chem Co. His involvement at this time is unclear, so we're just gonna keep tabs on both him and his family just in case. - So why isn't the agency handling this? - Apparently the mole is pretty high up in the company. I was informed by my old partner, Conner Wilson, that as of yesterday, all evidence we provided have been erased off that agency computers. Director Madison has secretly assigned Conner to the upcoming transport, but until the mole is discovered, any large scale action on the part of the agency would be futile. - So why should we help? - Because it's what you're trained to do. It's what you do best. Or would you rather sell carpet cleaning for the rest of your life to the little ladies who really just want someone to talk to? Or make sure that drunks keep their hands off of strippers, unless of course they pay for the privilege of doing so? You both are better than that. What's next? - Gathering intelligence. - Some need more intelligence than others. - The fence is electrified. There is guards about 500 feet. The perimeter is pretty solid, except for where Mo and I will go in. Now, they're also susceptible to an aerial assault, so Angel, you'll land your ultra light over by the loading dock, and then you'll go to the front gate, where you'll take out the guards, allowing Eric accessing to the security computers. Now, while I release the gas, Mo, you'll be in the basement. Disabling the communications system. You go join Angel, Eric, and I'll go down to find McDowell. Now, Feud, you'll stay in the van which will be the control central. They'll be arriving in a truck apparently designed to look like a moving van, so you'll have to be alert and let us know when it arrives. Which should be in about 20 hours, so we'll go in tonight. - We using deadly force? - No, not unless things get really ugly. We're gonna be using these dart guns. They will render the victim unconscious for about 12 hours. We'll have standard agency handguns just in case. Okay? Let's get to work. - So this should keep us visual. - Okay, and then I have this for communication. A little transmitter, receiver in here. - Do we have something stronger for Mo? - Yeah, if he needs it. External. - I brought the additional security you requested. - Terrific. Let's take 'em on a tour, show 'em our assignments. - Yes, let's. - It's gonna be a long night. Get some shut eye. - You doing okay? - Yeah, I can take care of myself. - I know. - I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm so tired. - I know. Everyone believes in you. You can stop trying to prove you're Wonder Woman. You can stop avoiding me. - I'm not avoiding you. I just don't know what you want from me. - I just wanna talk to you. Like old times. - It won't be like old times. Not ever. - I know. It can be better. - What did you do, spend all your time in prison trying to figure out ways to annoy me? - No, I spent a lot of time thinking about you. It kept me going. You know, maybe if you didn't spend so much energy trying to push me away, you'd see we have a second chance. You were always hard to seduce. There was a moment though. Feeling it. - Good night. - I could feel it. Okay, radio check complete Sam. We're ready. Okay. Angel should be landing any minute now. Stay sharp. - Dante, status. - All secured. - See, McDowell, everything's fine. Your entire family is being watched over by some of my finest people. I've got men stationed all over your facility to make sure everybody's safe and out of harms way. - What do you plan to do with the weapons once you have them? - Sell them, of course. - To whom? - My, my, my. We're getting inquisitive, aren't we? - My God, man, do you understand the destructive power of those weapons. I wouldn't be here if I didn't. - Hundreds of thousands could die instantly. - Brian, what's your point? - How much money does it take to silence all their screams? - Angel has landed, he's inside the compound. Repeat, Angel has landed. Prepare for entry. Here goes. You're clear. - Okay. - Stage one complete. - Copy that. Move it, you're under 30. We're going alive in five, four, three, two, one. Here goes. - How long? - I don't know, it's gonna take a few minutes. - I'll be right back. - Yeah, Dante, this is security central. - Go ahead. - Yeah, we just had a minor energy flux, kind of scrambled things for a minute, and I'm getting inconsistent readings from sector five. - I'll check it out. - Hey, you know, that Joe? Man, he's a real pisser, you know what I mean? No, I mean literally. Every five minutes, the man has got to take a piss, you know? I ask him if it hurt, you know, when he took a leak and everything, but, you know, he wouldn't answer me. And I kept telling them, you know, it was his prostate or something, you know. - Drop it. - Oops. - I think he's afraid. Afraid that a doctor will play finger puppet with his asshole. Ooh. Hey, hey where's Larry? - You okay? - Yeah. - How's it going? - I can't get through the firewall from here. We gotta get to the main computer. - I'll clear a path. Stay close and stay low. Mr. McDowell, relax. I have no wish to harm you or your family. As long as I get what I want. - But you don't mind killing thousands of innocent people? - Nobody's innocent anymore. - Sector seven, report in. Sector eight, report in. Mr. Vaughn, I think we might have a problem. - Well, do we or don't we? Copy sir. - Dante. - We have intruders. Shipment arrives in less than 20 minutes. I want a full security sweep. - Understood. - Problems? - For your family's sake, I hope not. You see, Brian, one call, and you're ordering coffins. - Dante, security breach. Gas released. - Cozin, Arrie, Manuel, bring your men. Meet me on the west side of the main building now. Where's Manuel? - I'm here. I thought you might need these. - All right, listen carefully. Cozin, your men will come with me. Arie, you and Manuel split up. I want you two to man the entry gate, I want you and you to search the outer perimeter of the property. Our shipment is in route, gentlemen, so make it thorough and quick. Understood? Let's go. - I see something. Come on, we found 'em. No, you stay here with him. - Stage three complete. - We're locked out. - Damn. We're stalled, we can't break in. I repeat, stage four is stalled. - We have intruders locked in the computer room. - Don't worry boys, the calvary has arrived. Step back. - Your problem, you solve it now. - Man, we don't have to worry about him anymore. - Yeah, I'll say. - Had to be a hero. - Well? - I'm working on it. - This is simple but effective. I like it. - I'm heading down to the gate, are you okay? - Sure. - What? - Don't leave him, got it? - Got it. Hurry up. - Dante, you still got two in security central? Now what do we have here? I'm terribly sorry but visiting hours are from eight to five weekdays. I'm afraid you've broken company policy. Stevens, show us your new friend. You! Now, this is a treat. I guess you didn't get our letter of rejection. Well, I've got your little friend here. He's a nervous little guy. I've got a remedy for his condition. - They're coming. - Bring him. - The convoy's on its way. Almost got it. Just one more second and I can shut them down. Yeah, well here they come. Come on. - Mr. McDowell, gotta wake up. Okay, come on, we gotta get out of here. - Okay, all right, in the closet. If anybody opens that door besides me, you shoot them, all right? Okay. - Take them. No running in the halls. - Bitch, I'm gonna kill you. - All sections report in. All sections report in, Arie, Cozin. Dante, Dante, where the hell are you? - You guys okay? - Yeah. - How many are left? - Not many. I could be wrong. - Business transaction, a simple business transaction, well damn you, McDowell. - Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an appointment to keep. - It's okay, I think that's everyone. - No, not quite. - Eric! - The party is over now. - You're fired. - Come on, be all right. - Sam! Wait here. - Help Eric. - What happened? - Help them. - Where are you going? - On scheduled flight. - Looks like I need a ride. Gear it up, Conner. - I can't do that, partner. - Then we have a problem. - Yeah, it looks like way. You know, I should have took care of you in Trinidad. Know what you cost me? The agency boys are here, this should be fun. So what's it gonna be? - What happened to you? - It was just gonna be the one time that you couldn't stay put. Now look at me. I just got a better deal. Benefits and retirement. - You were such a good agent. - Yeah, so were you. - Control, this is Alpha one. The shipment is secure. I say again, the shipment is secure. - I'm sorry about Angel. The agency picked up the cost of the funeral. It's the least we could do. - The least, it's pretty accurate. - Look, with McDowell's testimony and your heads up work, Vaughn and Fortress are out of business. We don't know how much damage Conner caused the agency, but we're doing our best to rectify the situation. You served the mission even though you were unauthorized to act. In appreciation, I'd like to offer you the recently vacated trainer position. - Why didn't you move in earlier? What? - The agency's not gonna put one man in a potential arm sale and just hope for the best. You were watching. The question is, why didn't you move in earlier? - Because the products were not in danger of being sold while they remained on Chem Co property. - The products? Our mission was to find out who the buyer was. - But what about the responsibility for the lives of the team? - You were not on our team. - Right. And I'm not about to change that status either, despite your generous offer. I'm starting my own company where people come first. - Here you go, Mr. McDowell. Thank you. - It was very generous of you to fund the Angel Memorial Foundation. - Heroes should not be forgotten. - Well, we appreciate it, and we want you to know that we're ready to fulfill your needs, and as you know, we can handle any situation. - I have no doubt about that. - Thank you. Well, guys, let's get to work.
