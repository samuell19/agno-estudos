You call these tires? Well, the salesman did... at least a few years back. It needs tires, no question. Needs more than tires. It's very reliable. Usually. Usually? Always. It's... it's usually always very reliable. Why you wanna sell it? Look, if it were a new Mercedes I wouldn't be selling it, but it's not and I am. it starts, it goes, it stops... and I think it's a fair price. What do you think? Well, straight up, I wouldn't let my dog ride in this thing. So that's, what, no? Please tell me he's gonna take it? I think he wants it, he's just playing hardball. Let's face it, it's nobody's dream car. Pour me a glass of that, will you? It's an embarrassment! Dad got that new Porsche and left us with this oil burner. It's not fair. All right, you've made your point. Now drop it, okay? It'll sell when it sells. Don't you have a date with your homework? Vitamin C break. Thank you. You're welcome. Mom, I'm 13, right? I don't like this conversation already. I'm the only one of my friends who still has a sitter. You're also the only one of your friends whose divorced mother has to work late nights. I don't want you home alone at that time of night. So what, now suddenly dad's gone and you don't trust me anymore? Oh, honey, I trust you. It's... it's the world that I don't trust. It's just not like it used to be when I was a kid. It's not even like it was a week ago. What's the deal? I thought you liked Mrs. Lacey. I like a lot of people, that's not the point. - Ah, didn't we have this conversation last month? - Mom... I know how to lock the doors, I know how to work the microwave and I know how to call 911. You want me to worry? Ah, great... If I worry, I can't do my work, and if I can't work, I'm not going to get promoted to daytime until you're old enough to vote. So... if you want to have a babysitter until you're 21, - just keep bringing this up. - This really bites. What was that? Age is only a state of mind. I mean, Gary Miser, he's only 13 and he already got a girl pregnant. Do you really wanna go there? Hmm, bad example. Your warden's here. Hey, Mrs. Lacey. Who died? My inner child. Mom doesn't trust me anymore. I do too. And I love you. Result's the same. He has homework, don't let him tell you he doesn't. - All right. - Dinner's in the fridge and I should be home around 2:30. Oh, the hours you keep! I n't know how you do it. Well, we all do what we have to do, don't we? Eric. Have a good night, okay? I love you too. ♪ ♪ - Enjoy your night! - Thank you. - Excuse me, miss? - I'll get your waitress. Christine, table 18 needs you. Oh, I need you to set table 4. Sure. Oh! You first. Hey, you. Hey. Relax a little. It's okay to take a breath from time to time. You work this room like your life depends on it. It does. My life, Eric's, my bank account. Yeah, I know, but the customers don't want to see you're working that hard. They're here for a good time. - You set the tone. - What's this? A guy slipped me 20 to give it to you. He's a little Tom Hanks, a little Banderas... no wedding ring. Ah, the sensitive assassin type. Thanks... no thanks. Goodnight. All right, anything else I can do for you tonight? You should be careful who you ask a question like that. No, I got it covered, I'll see you tomorrow. Uh, day after. Eileen's tomorrow. Goodnight. Tony... have you heard any rumours about the day manager position? Hmm. I thought maybe you would have heard something from Carmichael. No. No, nothing yet. You know, if you moved to the days, I'd never see you again. Somehow I think you'd survive. Have a good night. Oh, God. Oh, God. Pfff... Oh... God, he must be okay. I didn't see you. Are you okay? I'm sorry, I didn't see you. I... I just want to make sure you're okay, are you... I'm sorry, I didn't see you. I just wanna make... Okay. Sorry. Ah! What are you, crazy? What is he doing? Ah... Ah! Ah! Ah! Hey, it's a stop sign, lady, not a red light! What are you doing up? You're home late. It's 3 in the morning. Yeah, I just woke up and got hungry. Oh, and I figured someone needed to watch Mrs. Lacey, hmm. All right, back to bed. Did Mrs. Lacey tell you she's going away for a month? - You're kidding. - No. You're not. Great. Uh, are you all right? You don't look so good. Bad drive home, that's all. Okay, come on, bed. Goodnight, mom. Goodnight. Love you, baby. Me too. Mary. Hello? Hello? Hello? Is somebody there? Soda is not breakfast. So report me to the nutrition police. Where is this attitude coming from? It was a joke. Where's your sense of humour? And Gary's coming by to ride along to school, - if that's okay. - Yeah, it's fine. But you better get your books, it's time to go. Mom, is dad still coming over for dinner? As far as I know. Got some financial things to work out. Is that okay with you, him coming over? He can do what he wants, I don't care. Why don't I believe that? Whatever. Turning into my mother. Hello? Hello? Hello! - Hey, Gary. - Hey. Hey, Mrs. Sanders. - Hey, Gary. - Did you ask her? No, no, no, not yet. Um, mom, Gary wants to know if I can go over and sleep at his house tomorrow. Is it okay? Dad's taking us for mini-golf and burgers. Mrs. Sanders? I'll think about it. So does that mean yes? It means I'll think about it. Hey, rip that other sign off the window, will you? - But how are we ever going to... - Just take it off, I don't like the way it looks. It's not like he's asking to join a street gang. No, I don't think kids ask their mothers permission to join a gang. You know what I mean. It's only a sleepover. He's my son, maybe I should decide that. - Sweetheart, I was only... - Oh, I know, you were only doing what you always do and today is just a little bit more than I can handle. Could I get the check, please? Thank you. I don't like to see you so wrought up. If this thing last night... This thing last night was like something out of a Stephen King novel, all right? You don't know. No, but I know how you are. You've always been this way. - What way? - Oh, you know. Even as I girl, you never knew how to get mad. You shook, you cried, but you never got angry. I... I've fought back. You never really did. You sniped, you made smart remarks and ran for cover. All right, I knew there was a reason we don't have lunch together more often. See what I mean? Thank you. You need some time to yourself. Why don't you let me take Eric for a night? I haven't spoiled him in weeks. You could go to a movie, get your hair done. At least, think about it. - Hum... - Ha! Ha! Ha! Thanks for lunch. Take care. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Let me give you a hand with those! Hey, what are you doing home? Well, we had some sort of teacher thing, and I got off early. Oh, so I just got a ride home with Gary. - Oh. - Hey, what's for dinner? Pork chops. Pork chops? Pork chops. Yeah, dad's favourite. You know, I don't know why you make such a big deal over him. It's not like he's gonna notice. Don't start. They were on special. Yeah, whatever. So, did you see grandma today? Yeah. Hey, don't ruin your dinner. Oh, some guy called about the car. - He seemed pretty interested. - Good! Maybe we can get enough for a down payment on a car that runs. Um, I gave him the address and he might come by later. You did what? I gave him the address. That's what you told me to do. Did he leave a name? No, but his number's over there, by the phone. We're sorry, the number you have reached is not in service. Please check the number or try your call again. This is a recording. We're sorry, the number you... What? Isn't he there? No. No, he's not home. Oh, that's no problem, he said he might be coming by later. Don't give out the address anymore, okay? What did I do? Just don't. So we're just supposed to sit here and watch that car rust and rot in the driveway? Trust me, okay? I need you to go next door to Gary's for a little bit, okay? I've an errand to run, I'll be back in a little while. All right. Excuse me. Hi. I'd like to speak to someone in charge. Well, at the moment, that'd be me. Something I can do for you, ma'am? Yes. I'd like to file a report. There was a man on the expressway last night who chased me all the way from Philadelphia and tried to run me off the road. Look, this is really highway patrol's territory. I mean, you... Great. Did he damage your car? Well, no. And he just pursued you for no reason? I accidentally cut him off when I was changing lanes... Ah, well. What? So that gives him the right then to try to kill me? You think he wanted to kill you? I've had 3 phone calls since then, hang-ups, and I'm pretty sure it's the same guy. Okay, and how would he get your phone number? I'm trying to sell my car, the phone number's in the window. Did you get a licence number? It... it was dark, I was terrified. But... it was a large, dark SUV. Model? I didn't notice. Then can you give me a description of the man? The windows were tinted, I couldn't see inside. - But you know it was a man. - I feel it was a man! You feel it was a man. Ma'am, do you have any idea how many large, dark SUVs are on the road these days? Okay. So you're saying that there's nothing you can do. Not without more to go on. What do expect us to do? I drive that way home almost every night. What if I run into him again? Look, the odds are 1 in a million. You can't imagine how reassuring that is. Thank you. Well, your mom tells me you're going out for the swim team. Tryouts. Coach thought he might be their champion freestyler. Well, I'm impressed. - Attaboy. - Can I go do my homework? There's a question I never thought I'd hear in my lifetime. Anything I can help with, huh? What's the project? It's an essay for English. Five hundred words about a poem by a dead guy and it's still better than sitting out here. Eric... He gets this way sometimes. He doesn't mean anything by it. What do you tell him when I'm not around, Joanne? You turn him against me? I think you've done a pretty good job at that yourself. He just doesn't know how to act around you anymore. Neither do I. Here, let me help you with that. Don't, all right? Just... don't. You used to complain I didn't help. We used to be married, all right? Let's just talk about what we have to, okay? So this wasn't just dinner, huh? Quality time with my adoring son? I can't give you any more money, if that's the agenda. And I hate to have to ask you for it. You know, I am taking on every new client that I can manage, but my paycheck won't stretch any farther. If I put any more overtime in, I might as well just move into the office! I'm working too, Keith. In case you haven't noticed, I've been paying my own way - for some time, now. - So did I say you weren't? Eric, he's growing so fast, he needs new clothes every time I turn around. And school is asking the parents to make up for all the budget cutbacks. He needs lunch money, gym fees... And I've got to do something about the roof before the next rains. - The car is on its last legs. - So what the hell can I do? Well, maybe if you hadn't spent so much on that woman - you were trying to impress... - Don't go there. My God, Keith, a sportscar! I don't wanna get into that! I was working 5 nights a week to help you keep our heads above water and you're spending your money on another woman. How do you think that made me feel? How many times you want me to say I'm sorry? Once would be enough if I believed it. Is she still getting money from you? Is that the real problem? Look, I didn't come here to argue with you tonight. You know, I didn't want to argue either, Keith, but if you were living up to your responsibilities, we wouldn't be doing this! I'm not going to talk to you when you're like this. Thanks for dinner! Hello? Okay... You listen, and you listen good: you have reached a woman who is in no mood for this. As far as I'm concerned, you are an impotent coward who's hiding behind a phone line. And if you are the jerk who chased me on the expressway last night, may I just say, "I hope you rot in hell!" You'll be sorry you said that, Joanne. Eric, are we okay? What do you mean? We used to be pretty tight, but the last couple of weeks... Do we have to talk about this? Is it me, is it something at school? You know what it is! Dad ignores us for weeks and then has this attitude like we should be blood brothers or something. I mean, who needs that? Well, I think you do. Listen, I know this has been hard. It has been hard on everybody, but we just need to try to get through it. He said he'd try to get you tickets when the Phillies play the Cubs. Would I have to go with him? Look, I know he has hurt you, but at least give him credit for trying to make it up to you, okay? You love the Cubs. When's the game? Schedule's in the paper. Unless you brought it in, it's probably still on the steps. Check to see if the ad for the car is still running while you're at it. All right. Hey, where'd these come from? Oh, they were outside the front door. I guess he's trying to make it up to you. Hmm, how about that? Okay, the Cubs aren't in town for a little while. Unless he meant he was gonna fly me out to Chicago. Mom? Yeah, maybe. Mom, have you thought any more about me staying at Gary's tonight? You... you need to hurry up. Get your bags, we need to get to school, come on. R. I. P. You know anybody with these initials? They stand for "rest in peace," Carol. I know, I know. I yelled at him on the phone last night. He's out there. He spoke to me. Did you call the police? Yeah, I think they think that I'm a hysterical woman who needs driving lessons. Maybe I am. I don't know, I can't even handle a simple argument with my ex-husband. Oh, hi. I'll be with you in a minute. Listen, you want my advice, Joanne? Stop mourning over your ex. If that moron ever calls back, hang up. Say "screw the world" and get on with your life. Yeah. You know, you're right. That is exactly the advice I needed to hear right now. Okay. Screw the world. - Ooh! That's my girl friend! - I'll call you later. ♪ ♪ Drinking on the job, now? I need something to get rid of this cold. I have not been this sick in years. Yeah. I guess the flu fairy noticed! Busy night? Not that bad. You handle it well. - Oh. - 9.0 It's usually not an Olympic event, but I do my best. Rick Hargate. Can I buy you a drink? Oh, uh... no thanks, I'm working. Sorry. I'm sorry too. Nice quartet. You like jazz? Yeah. One of the benefits of working here. I'm gonna... Nice to meet you. You too. Right, so I have you down at 8:30 on next Friday night. Thank you. Bye-bye. Okay, you could not possibly feel as bad as you look. Thanks, I needed that. Wanna do me a favour and close up tonight? You're taking off? Yeah, either I put this cold to bed or I die right here, right now. Either way, you gotta close up. Okay, yeah, no problem. Just... take care of yourself, feel better. You're a saint. Yeah. Santana's. Oh... Sorry, wrong number. Oh, damn it! - Yeah, hello? - Keith. Sorry. You said 20 min. There's no traffic this time of night. Right. You okay? Just... feeling a little foolish. Where's the car? It's in the back. It was flat. It was flat. I wouldn't have made this up to get you out here at 2 in the morning. If I had, I certainly would've made sure it was flat when you got here. You didn't send me roses this morning, did you? Somebody's sending you roses? It's not what it sounds like. I... had a problem the other night on the way home from work. I accidentally cut somebody off and they chased me on the expressway and... since then I've had a couple of prank calls and this morning, a dozen roses with a card saying they're for my grave. Well, I can see how you thought they were from me. Humph! Ah! Just... Guess I hoped they were a joke or something, you know? Burying the hatchet, I don't know. Well, a strange sense of humour, even for me. Joanne, I know things haven't been easy for you lately. I mean, you got a lot on your mind. I'm sure it's nothing. It's probably just some kid with too much time on his hands. Just ignore it. How do you do that? You always manage to put things into perspective for me, you know? It's what I first loved about you. Oh, I thought it was the way I threw a football. Hmm. How could I tell? You were always on the bench. The coach would just save me for the right time. Hmm. You know, um, Eric doesn't want to admit it, but I think he's... hoping that we're gonna get back together. I don't know what to tell him. I'd say his mother had a good reason for kicking me out of the house. It's probably better for all of us this way. Helen, hi, it's Joanne. I'm sorry to call so late. I just wanted to make sure that Eric is there and that everything's okay. Oh, thank God. What time did you say you got home, ma'am? About 3, I think... 3:15, maybe. And this is the way you found the place? Yes. Did you touch anything? A few things... maybe, I don't know. It's probably kids after drug money. - Drug money? - Yup. You have a son, you said. Yeah, he's staying at a friend's tonight. I called, he's fine. My son doesn't use drugs, if that's what you're... He doesn't even know anybody who uses drugs. You might be surprised. No, I know my son. He... I don't think this is kids looking for drug money. - No? No. So you think whoever chased you on the expressway 2 nights ago is responsible? For the break-in, the nuisance calls, the... the flowers? Yes, I'd say there's a pretty good chance it's the same guy. Can't you just do something? I'm afraid to answer my phone! - You don't have caller ID? - No. I realize that puts me in the dark ages, but I'm sort of counting pennies these days. Excuse me for a second. Uh... Mrs. Sanders... Let me guess... there's nothing you can do. With nothing else to go on, no. A dark SUV, a card anyone could've written... Look, most break-ins... Don't tell me about most break-ins, tell me about this one! Okay. I think it's possible you're running through a string of bad luck. - A string of bad luck. - Yes. The only thing I could suggest is change your phone number, maybe get a dog, a security system. Ah... I don't believe this. For better for worse, that's how it works. I can put an extra patrol on your house for the next couple of days, if that'll make you feel better. Yes, it would. Okay. There's not much more I can offer you. We'll check around outside, see if we can get some leads there. Also, when you have a chance to go through the damage, make us a list so we know what's missing, okay? Okay. Oh, and you'll want to take care of that front door right away. Mrs. Sanders, you have another place you can stay tonight? Yes, I do. Good. Go there for tonight, come back here and take care of things tomorrow, okay? Oh... and here's my card. If you need anything, call me. Thank you. All right. Goodnight. Let's go. Well, I'm still doing it. I'm a grown woman and here I am running to mommy. You know my door's always open. Although it's too bad you don't have Keith at home. How can you say that, mom? He was seeing another woman. I'm not apologizing for him. Whatever reason he had for that, it wasn't good enough. But he didn't leave you. You might've stood your ground, worked it out, for Eric's sake, not your own. Why did you end it? Because I needed him too much. And... I was afraid he would leave me for her. Just like your father and I. We're quite the pair, aren't we? Well, I don't know about you, but I'm going to try and get some sleep with what's left of the night. Do you... really wish that you'd worked things out with dad? Oh, sweetheart... you know, life is so short. By the time I was ready to forgive him, it was too late. It is not too late for you. Goodnight. Yeah, hello? Hi, it's me again. Did you get home okay? Yeah. Well, it... it's been an interesting evening, but I can tell you about that another time. I... I... I just wanted to say thanks again for what you did tonight. You call at... 4:30 in the morning to say thanks? Oh... Yeah. I know I can be bossy sometimes, and overprotective! Ha! Ha! But I always meant well. I guess when your father left I dug my claws into you for fear I'd wind up some foolish old woman living alone with her cats. You're too strong for that. So are you, if you give yourself the chance. Stronger every day, now, hmm? You really think so? Am I ever wrong? Ha! Ha! Ha! Go on. Okay. Thanks. Bye. Hi, buddy. - Hey. - Hi. How is she? She's still unconscious, but the doctors say she's gonna pull through. You okay? - Did you get much sleep lately? - No, not really. Couldn't if I tried. You look pretty tired too. - Wanna go out and get a burger? - I'm not hungry. Look, is there anything I can do? What about the guy on the expressway? - He went away, I guess. - Mom? It's nobody, sweetheart. Well, you changed your mind about that burger? Mom needed you, where were you? I was out of town, I couldn't help it, son. Don't call me that. Listen, Eric, I don't want to argue, okay? I got back as soon as I could. You're always gone, just like before! You left and never thought about us again. That's not the way it happened. That's exactly the way it happened. You think I wasn't paying attention? When you get older, things get a little bit complicated, okay? I can't expect you to understand that. Yeah? You don't expect much of me, do you? You don't care about me and you don't care about mom. Sit down here. You know, despite everything that's happened, I love your mom and I love you. Now, maybe I wasn't the perfect father... Finally something we can agree on. Anyway, listen, your mother is going to be fine. You, on the other hand... I'm gonna be fine. Well, then, let's prove it to the both of us. shopping 101. Or have you forgotten the basics? Pamper yourself. How these? Those look perfect. They match! How about this? Look. If you're 12. It's cute. - This, on the other hand, is so you. - Oh, my! What? Yeah! What about this? That's pretty. Oh, beautiful. I love those. Oh, I wanna get these. Okay. You should get this. I still think that teddy has you written all over it. One step at a time. It seems like years since I've shopped for anything more exciting than breakfast cereal. Ha! Ha! Ha! What? What's wrong? I'm gonna get out of here. Wait, wait, waityou've said so yourself, the phone calls have stopped, this guy is out of your life, your mother is on the mend. She's coming home next week, right? I can't explain it, I just wanna go. Ah... Joanne... I have some dry cleaning to pick up and I wanna stop by the hospital. - Will you come? - Okay. I'll get your bag. I got it. Thank you. Carol, I hate this. Someone looks twice in my direction and I'm sure it's him. You've had a month from hell. I'd be paranoid too after all that. Help yourself to whatever's in the fridge. Pour one for me too, okay? Okie-dokie. The blood was red paint. The only fingerprints on it were yours, Mrs. Sanders. We're gonna go back to the store, see what records they may keep. Somebody may've remembered something. Maybe they have a camera or something. Anything's possible. So that's it? No, there's more. We got people report back on the car explosion. Because of all the damage, it took some time, but... What? It's highly probable that the fuel line was tampered with. So it wasn't an accident and now my whole family's in danger. What am I supposed to do? You let us worry about that. So what's going on? I thought I was riding home with Gary and his dad today. - Change of plans, sorry. - All right... Hey, what's with all the suitcases? We're going away for the weekend. Where? You'll see. All right. Mom, a high school dropout could figure out that there's something weird going on. So what's up? It's nothing. It's a lot of things. It's... your grandmother, the mess I made of everything. You and your father are barely speaking. Okay, no, that is not your fault. He's the one who just walked out. You know what, I don't need him. Of course you do, honey, he's your father! Yeah, well what about him? Doesn't he need me? Yes, he does. He just doesn't know how to talk to you anymore. Damn it! Eric, I can't do it all. If you want to hate your father, then hate him. But if you want him, you've got to let him know. Yeah? Well same to you! Mom... we're always straight with each other, right? So I think I deserve to know what's going on. There's someone after me. I don't know who and I don't know why. But the police think it's too dangerous to stay in the house for a while. The guy you were talking about at the hospital? Yeah. Does dad know we've left the house? No. I've told Carol and she's gonna come by if you need anything at all, okay? Just... work with me on this, will you? - Mrs. Sanders? - Ah! - Are you all right? - Yeah. I've checked out the room, everything is fine. Follow me. Okay. Do you mind if I have a few friends over, maybe? We don't want anyone knowing where you are for a while, Eric. Not even Gary? No, honey. No one, okay? Just you and your mom for a few days. - It's important. - Okay. - Go on in. - Ooh, nice. You can rest easy here. Just find this guy, okay? Mrs. Sanders, you can we're covering your home, we're covering your phones. If this guy so much as even blinks, we'll get him. You have my number in case you need to reach me? Yeah. - Detective Bruder. - Yes? Thank you. You're welcome. Bye, Eric. Bye, detective. Hey, hey, hey! We got pay-per-view! All right! So, mom, mind if I maybe, I don't know, order in a movie while you're at work? Sure. Order a couple if you want. Yeah! - And how does a pizza sound for dinner? - No way! You, like, never let me have pizza for dinner at home! Yeah, well, we're not at home. Here, if you want pizza, you get pizza. All right! Yeah! Eric... just promise me you won't answer the phone, or open the door for anybody but me, okay? No problem. Yeah. Or the pizza dude! Right, or the pizza dude. Ha! Ha! Oh, um, could you hold on to this? - No problem. - Thanks. - I'll be right with you. - Sure. - The Flower Pot... - Hi! Do you know where I could find Joanne Sanders? I'm afraid you're going to have to ask detective Bruder that question. I'm his partner, ma'am. You might remember me from the station? Hmm! You wouldn't happen to be that dark-haired one with the George Clooney dimples, would you? Ha! And here I thought you hadn't noticed me. Oh, I noticed. Well, my name's sergeant Kibu, badge number 32808. You can call it in if it makes you feel more comfortable. No, no, no, that's okay. I absolutely remember you. So... what can I do you for? Well, there's been a break in the case, but detective Bruder's in court, I can't get in touch with him. Mrs. Sanders said you would know where to reach her in case of emergency. Hum... I'd really appreciate it. Well, if it'll help trap that bastard, why the hell not. You know, you can find her at Santana's in Philadelphia. She's going back there tonight. Great. 555-7881. - Oh... Oh, thank you so much. - You're welcome. Bye. ♪ ♪ Yeah, it's her 1st night back. Some coincidence, huh? Pardon me. Hey! Has it been like this since I've been gone? We did not know how valuable you were before, but sure do now. I want you to meet somebody. Oh, we've met, but we weren't formally introduced. - Hi. - Joanne, is it? You 2 know each other? Not exactly, but we established the other night that we both like jazz. I see it has brought you back in. It wasn't only the music that brought me back. Well, it's always good to have a regular customer. Nice to see you again. Didn't sound to me like she meant that. Goodnight, thank you. Santana's, may I help you? - Hello? - Hello, Joanne. You should know by now you can't get away from me. Those earrings, they look so good on you. They make your eyes sparkle. Why are you doing this to me? Because I can. Detective Bruder, please. It's an emergency. So, no mushroom, no pepper, no onion. Just sausage and double cheese. Salad? Get real! This is a vacation. Thirty minutes? What do I get if it takes longer? A cold pizza, yeah, right. Mrs. Sanders. Is he here? Yeah. Dark sport coat at the bar, on the left. Got him. Are you sure? I'm sure. All right. You stay here, we'll take care of him. Follow me. Real busy, yeah. I've got to be back home for a change. - How you doing, guys? - Good, how are you? - And that's it. Excuse me? Detective Bruder, Philly P.D. Can I see some identification, please? What's this all about, detective? - Just get me a soda. - I'm old enough to drink, officer, if that's the problem. - First of all, it's not officer, it's detective. Second, I wanna see some ID now. Mind stepping outside with me, Mr. Hargate, for a few moments? It won't take long. - Who is it? - Rapid Pizza. Oh, finally! Oh, man. - You Eric Sanders? - Oh yeah. I'm the hungry Eric Sanders. So how much is it? $12.50. All right. Let's see... 1... 2... 7... 12... It had to be him. He had to be the one. He's a tourist, he wasn't even in town that night. Plus, his car comes nowhere near matching your description for the expressway. Look, we got his information, but he checks out. He's not our guy. I was so sure. Look, Mrs. Sanders, this may take a little more time, but we'll get this guy, I promise you. You okay to get back tonight? Yeah. All right. Who the hell is that? I don't know. I'll be right back. I'm sorry, I know it's late. It's worse than that, it's early. Is this gonna be a regular thing with you now? Can I come in? Look... whatever it is, let's do it in the morning, okay? Later in the morning. It... it can't wait. I need to talk to you. It's really not a good time right now, Joanne. I've made a decision. I don't wanna be my mother. I don't wanna wind up wishing I'd said something or wanting to change something and not being able to. I just don't want that to happen. Maybe it's the hour, but you're not making too much sense right now. Keith? Cindy, this is Joanne. Joanne, this is Cindy. Could we have created a more awkward moment if we had tried? I was wondering what was going on. Just an ex-wife in the process of making a fool of herself. Oh... Would you like something to drink? - No, thank you. Sorry. I'm... gonna go back to bed. Maybe you've got a right to be angry. I don't need you to tell me that. Oh, come on, Joanne! You know what, Keith? I'll tell you why I came here. I came here to tell you I don't need you. I don't need you to be my hero anymore, I'm fine on my own. Maybe not as good as I was with you, not yet, but I'm getting my life back together and I'm doing it myself. No, you are not gonna make me feel guilty for this. We're divorced. Yeah, we are. Best news I've had all week. Look... I'll call you tomorrow. I'd rather you didn't. Eric? Hey. Hey, sweetie. Are you feeling okay, baby? What have you done with my son? You knew it was me? I'm disappointed, I wanted to surprise you. - Where's my son? - Pick up the phone and walk toward the window. Did you ever sell that car of yours? I was beginning to think you were never gonna come home. But you're too good a mom for that, aren't you, Joanne? Guess you take after your own mom in that way. What do you know about my mother? Ha! You could say I was her mechanic. Oh, God... I'll do anything. I will. Just please don't hurt my child. He's perfectly safe, Joanne. He's with me. What do you want? - I will do whatever you ask. - I know that. And it's a very good feeling. Tell me what to do! When I finish talking, I want you to hang up the phone and put it on the ground where I can see it. On the carpet, there. Then I want you to come outside, get in your car, throw your cell phone into the bushes. - Then you follow me. - My son... Your son? Oh. Oh, if you do what I say, he'll be fine. Please don't hurt him. There's only one way to ensure that, Joanne. Follow me. I'll be watching you every step of the way. Put the phone down. Do it. Come on, Joanne, come on. Yeah. Now what? Get out of the car. I said, get out of the car! Where's my son? I wanna see my son. He's fine. - Mom! - Eric! - For now. What do you want? Take the keys out of the ignition. Don't make me repeat myself! Get the keys out of the ignition! Drop 'em! Why are you doing this? - Aaah! - I'm in charge now! I ask the questions! Do you understand me? Okay, okay. Tell me what you want me do to. I want you to apologize to me. I'm sorry. I have to believe it. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't know why it is, but I am just not buying it, Joanne. Beg. I want you to beg. Please... please... please don't hurt my son. I know you're mad. I know... I know, I understand, you're mad at the world. I... Isn't there some part of you that understands what it's like to love somebody? Somebody... - I don't wanna hear it! - Mom! Aaah! Mom! Ah! Ah! I'm in charge now. You won't shoot me. I know you too well, Joanne. Don't! Right, kill me or I'll kill you. Either way, it'll all be over. - Ah! - Aaah! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! - Mom! - Baby. Honey, it's over. - I thought I was gonna die. - No. - It was so scary. - It's over. Honey, you're okay. - I was scared. - Everything's okay. He's not gonna hurt us anymore, okay? It's over. It's over, honey. Mom! It's not over, Joanne! Get in the car. Why are you doing this? You cut me off!
