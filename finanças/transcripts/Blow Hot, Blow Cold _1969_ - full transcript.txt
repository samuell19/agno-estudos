Ladies and gentlemen, may I ask you to go to the parlour. To the parlour, ladies and gentlemen. Please go downstairs to the salon! Please, downstairs to the salon! - Wait, don't forget the suitcase. Please, come along. Where are you going? Come here. - No. Come over Laetitia. Don't you want to dive in? I have no bathing suit. I changed my mind, I'd rather go downstairs. Here, take my jacket. It suits me better anyways. - Yes. There. Not right now. Listen... Right here, in front of everyone? Yes. I'll show you where. We can crawl under there. No. Do you want to spend the holidays in jail? I do not know you, sir, and I'll tell anyone listening. I'm leaving. - Farewell. Are you feeling well? I'm fine. "Hot Blood In The Veins" Good morning. Your name? - Robinson. Right, you were here before. Your name is? Mister and Miss... ? Jansen. Your bungalow is over there. The servant will bring you your luggage. Good morning. - Professor Lindmark. Professor Lindmark from Sweden. Bungalow no. 6. The servant will take you there. Here we are. Should I take the luggage inside? - Just leave it here. Anything else? Thank you. For you. - Thank you. I'm sweaty. I'll take a bath. A shower on the ship and a bath in the bungalow. Soon there will be nothing left of you... Here's a shower. Is there a bathroom too? Here it is. I changed my mind. I won't take a bath. But I need to change. I'm soaked. How about you? - Me too. Good lord, I look like a witch. I'd like some informative literature on the Tremiti Islands. What's that? A history book? Great, thank you. This seems to be a nice hotel. -Yes it does. You rung, madam? Gunnar come here. -Yeah. Have you rung? Yes, my wife's clothes need to be ironed. Gladly. And yours too? If possible. - Of course. Thank you. You know what's fascinating me over and over again? Those two cute spots. Seriously. Look at them, honey. They stand there like two guardsmen. Two strict guards watching a strategically important area. Is that all you like about me? No, there is more. But we have seven more days to talk about that. We have to do something about your hair, honey. We'll find someone who can help you. Is there a hairdresser in the hotel? As soon as possible. Signora Lindmark... No. Lind-mark. Yes. I'm trying to wash up. Listen, I have a complex. I'd like to explain... make a confession. I can trust you with a secret? Sure, I'll only tell all my friends. Seriously, if word got around I'd be ruined. But nothing better could happen to you. I'm only good as long as I'm challenged. Two are needed for this game. You poor little boy. What's the big idea? Come here. - No! Don't come near me! - Come here! You touched it! Disgusting! Laetitia, please. - Don't touch me! Ridiculous! - You touched this disgusting thing! Come on. - No! There's a lizard in the shutters. Would you remove it? Of course. Go inside. I beg you, you are half naked. So what? Nobody knows us anyway. You don't care that I'm scared, you only care that I'm naked. I'm very sorry, but I promise they are harmless. It's alright, thanks. Come on in. Typical hysterical woman. Come, get dressed. You don't get it. Is it my fault I'm scared of that awful creature? Where are we going to sleep? I don't care! In a sleeping bag? Can't you think of a better thing to do with a woman? Laetitia, you're depraved. Can you see the white rocks? They're called "dying elephant". You see the head and it's trunk in the water. Look at the cliff over there, it's called the dying elephant. Yes how funny... the tip of the cliff does look like an elephants head... with it's trunk under the water. Are those the birds of Diomedes? No, just ordinary seagulls. The birds of Diomedes only come out in dark nights. When there's no moonlight. Their cries sound like wailing. This is the only place on earth where you can find this sort of birds. According to legend they were human once. They came as young men with Diomedes as their leader. When Diomedes died all his friends transformed into birds. The Greek hero lived in exile. He left his homeland because his wife was unfaithful. She slept with his best friend. We all know the story and don't find it all that interesting. Why did you stop him? Those Italians... they always smear everything. Look, it's the bridge of wishes. It's said to have magic powers. What powers? The islanders say that a virgin passing through will marry within one year. Fantastic! - How so? Imagine, there really are girls who still are virgins when they marry. What do you think of that? What are you doing? Don't you know? If it's true you marry when passing it one could reverse it just as well. If you pass backwards you may get a divorce. I'm afraid even a magical bridge can't make this miracle happen. Are those the famous Tremiti Island figs? I don't know if they're famous but they are figs alright. Allow me to introduce myself. Gunnar Lindmark, Professor of psychology of the Uppsala University. A pleasure. - The pleasure is all mine. This is my wife. Margit! We are Swedes. Would you like a fig? - Thank you. No. What is it? - You have to peel it. The skin tastes bitter. - I see. Thank you. Very sweet. Tastes good. It's the first time I taste fresh figs. - Really? I'd like to think my wife would like to taste one too. Of course. I bring her some. But she only speaks Swedish. Would you like to try one? What did you say? She only speaks Swedish? She's not speaking at all! Don't be cheeky, Giulio! Well... Laetitia. Take a look. There are pearls in Adriatic oysters. Here is proof. It may be rare but they exist. Giulio, you know I don't care about those things. Oh Laetitia! Forgive me. You must repent. I promise to plant a tree. This very evening. You haven't even sinned yet. You're right. We'll make good right away. I'm not a moralist, but I don't think it's appropriate to do those things in public. Ciao! Gunnar, what do you know about love? Quite a few things my dear. But from another outset. It's for Jan and Greta. Would you like to write something? I wrote to them yesterday. Aha. Why didn't you tell me? Was it necessary? It would have made me... made me glad. Every time I see this boat my shackles come to mind. What boat? I don't see a boat. I feel free, but suddenly the tie-ups seem unbreakable. That can't be. If you're determined to break it... I know, you should remind me more often. The way you count is wrong. You say: It's three days, then two, then one... I think instead, yesterday it was four days... Today five... Always one more. Of course we have to go back. There are other things in life too. I have to put food on the table. And pay for gas. This is what I despise. The idea of the mainland, lying in wait. You would get rheumatism if you had to live on the island. I want rheumatism! Are you crazy? Let's play tourists. But we are. Real tourists only appear in flocks. They are all short-sighted. And stick their noses in the air. What a wonderful simplicity. Our cemeteries in comparison... This seems more natural. Nothing gloomy about it. No feeling of decay, if you know what I mean. Isn't it wonderful here? Do you understand a little bit? Yes... no. I understand a little bit. I don't understand a word you're saying. I like being with young people. They transfer some of their vitality. So we're useful after all. What style is this? - Where are we going now? It's a disgrace this all went to ruin. This structure is a rarity. It's one of the few convents that served as a military fort. This slogan is also written on the entry archway. Look for it when we go back. It means "to smite" or "to destroy". A nice way to greet guests. - Well... The monks were rather martial. Today the slogan seems futile. No. No, no. All faith is intolerant. Even aggressive. Only an opinion is tolerant. - Maybe... But one thing is certain. Without their steadfast faith the monks would never have had the strength to fight off the Turkish fleet like they did in 1657. Smite and destroy... ...the enemy. I think the monks were right. What are we doing? These people are annoying. Let's go. This is the age of mass tourism. It's the law of the flock. You know that laws are made to be broken. Laetitia, you are unsocial. Of course. Are you not interested in the fighting monks? Sure, enormously. Do you think there are bats in here? Yes, better put on a headscarf. So it's true that they get tangled up in your hair? You could create a new style. The bat hair style. Now the truth reveals itself! You're not here because of me but you're looking for stupid antiques for your snobby customers. Kneel down... And beg for forgiveness. Bless me, father, for I have sinned. Speak... And confess your sins. Have you succumbed to the temptations of lust? Yes, often. I admit it. And worst, I feel no regret. Take care. Or you'll bear little sinners. But I want a whole band of sinners. Careful! The flock is coming! The Vikings. The confessional. Do you know the confessional of our age? What's that? A couch. A couch? - Yes. To kneel down in a confessional is like lying on a psychiatrist's couch. The modern form of confession. Of course, you're right. But... But this confessional interests me as a piece of antique furniture. Are you interested in antiques? If I'd say yes it would be a lie. Maybe there's no appreciation in the northern parts for antiques. All islands give the feeling of physical limitation. This one especially, with its history of forced austerity. First the monks, then the convicts serving a life sentence. You're mistaken. Don't let the appearance deceive you. Of course convicts have to be locked up. Away from society. But they didn't live an austere life. Think, on their request King Ferdinand IV sent them a boat with prostitutes coming from the slums of Naples. Their offspring makes up today's population. So they are literally sons of whores. One word about the monks. Let me tell you a story. Look at these three islands closely. People wonder why the islands Capraia and San Nicola are bleak while San Domino is densely forested. It was law in the monastery for every monk to plant a tree as repentance for a committed sin. At least it is something different... More amusing than sitting around at the hotel. Here, the monks planted the trees. I have the feeling we should have planted trees too. Do you really think the birds of Diomedes exist? Nah! - It's said to be true. Are we there? We can't drive any further. You have to walk the rest. Oh, walking again. Nothing's convenient here. One moment please. Let me go first. I'm wearing sandals. Stay close by. - Wonder how far it is... Quite romantic. Watch out. Watch it! Don't go near the slope. Here we wait. You can sit if you like but stay away from the slope. Don't lean forward, it's dangerous! The birds of Diomedes, an albatross, only hunt by night. Right now is mating season. If they hunt by night they must make love by day. Who? - The Diomedes. They don't come out on a full moon. They stay in the nest. In a full moon they even make love at night. Splendid! How right they are. It's the best kind. Absolutely correct, my darling. Over there! They scare me. Frederick, Frederick, dear... my love, my love. Would you like to take a look under water? Here. - Thank you. I have to leave. Too bad. Good bye. I saw a moraine today. If I had my spear gun on me... Bang! I never caught a moraine before. To hell with your fishing! You think it's fun sitting around waiting for hours while you're gone? What's wrong? Can't you think about anything else beside fish? Listen, you told me not to bring along my spear gun. So I did not bring it. Now it's my fault? Thank you very much! We're only seven days here. More time is not possible because of your business affairs. Laetitia, sometimes you're insufferable. Think so? In only twenty-four hours the suffering is over. You could take comfort with the blonde Swede. What's wrong? Are you looking for a fight? Without me! Whistle when you've cooled off. I can't whistle. Yes that's right! Allow me to offer the champagne you did not win tonight. Thank you but it's not the same. I promise that I... how do you say? I had my fingers crossed. We let you down. Let's propose a toast. Let's drink a toast. Swedish style. - Skol! Skol! - Skol! Laetitia is a really pretty name, ask her if it's common in Italy. My wife says that she likes you name. She'd like to know if it's a common name? It is quite rare, I'd even say it's... It's aristocratic. - What? It's an aristocratic name. Don't listen to her. It was so common, people were tired of hearing it. Nowadays you only find it in underdeveloped regions. Cut it out. Laetitia, Laetitia. Why is your name Laetitia? And now the final pair. Congratulations to the winners. Congratulations. Giulio, why don't you ask the lady for a dance? Gladly. Do you allow me to dance with your wife? Of course. Go ahead. You're a good dancer. Delicate and graceful, like your swimming in the water. No. Right! You don't understand. I'd like to know what they are talking about. Me too. It's a mystery. Don't take it amiss when I tell you that you remind me of my wife. She was 17 when we got married. I was 32. Bravo! The most fun I had in a long time. She says that she didn't enjoy herself like that for years. And you didn't want to join us, Professor. At my age, this is not my kind of amusement any more. Don't call me Professor, call me Gunnar. Cheers. Cheers - Skol. Children, let's dance. Now circle around. Come on, all-around! And now we dance all-around. Frederick! Do you want to go for a walk? Can't you go by yourself? I'm bored by you. Where do you want me to go? These islands are so small. What is if... What happens if... If what? It's crazy, but I can't help myself. What is crazy? I have the feeling it's all over. It's over. We leave this afternoon. Back at the mainland... If we go on we will destroy it all. Have you gone crazy? What's going on? I bit you because I wanted to hurt you. Why did you do that? Because... - Why? Why me? We love each other and lovers have to suffer. Yes, a dead man. An accident, presumably. A tourist. He's fallen on the rocks. No, he was alone. At the rescue attempt the body was turned over. Yes, I wait for you. Yes, I will get the paperwork done. I arranged everything. Like you told me. I'm very sorry, Madam. But I have to ask a few questions. I have the drivers license of the deceased, but it's not sufficient. I need more details for the report. What was his occupation? Antiques dealer. He was self employed? - Yes. Occupation: Antiques... ...Dealer. Marital status? Married. He was not married. You understood right. I was not his wife. What about you? Are you married? Yes. In this case I need your husband's data. Can you tell me where you found the body? He was down there. The water was not as high. At the time it was low tide. An officer should lie down in the position the body was found. Yes, sir. Was his head over there? - Yes. A bit forward. Stretch out the right arm. That is it. - That's the position? It's not getting us anywhere. The position of the body can't give details about the circumstances. Maybe he was climbing? Then slip and fell. Or... he had a cramp while swimming. And the surf washed him on the rock. We can't rule out that it was not an accident. Why was he alone? Why weren't you together? It was windy and the surf was too strong for me. I didn't want to go swimming. When you heard the scream you were at the opposing bay, correct? You instantly came over. Yes, instantly. And then? Soon after Prof. Lindmark came. Then his wife, a bit later. How much later? 30 minutes? No, only a few minutes. I couldn't tell. That's it for the moment. Wait... we should take a look around on the cliff. My wife was reading a book. I wasn't able to keep my newspaper open. The wind was too strong. I got up and climbed the cliff. There I saw both of them. Like always they were at their beach place. Ask your wife if she's seen someone on the rock. Or if she saw anything strange. Did you see anyone on the cliffs? Anything unusual? Have they confided in you? Did you know they were not married? No. Did you know they weren't married? No... they were too happy to have been married. My wife says, they were too happy for a married couple. Frederick and I were happy together. I haven't forgotten it. You haven't forgotten it... you haven't forgotten it either. What did she say? My wife is a bit confused. I didn't know she took this death to heart. You barely knew him. It's not about yesterday's accident. It's about a similar accident that happened a long time ago. About ten years. A good friend of ours. A sore point, you know. Of course. I understand. One more question. Gladly. Did you hear a scream? Yes. I heard someone screaming. And then I saw Laetitia running to the grotto. Are you sure? You saw her run over right after the scream? That is correct. It's me. I don't know. From Buenos Aires? Try to understand. I know he's my husband but I don't want to talk to him. I can't stand it. Mother, I can't wrap my mind around it. I don't know yet. Don't worry, mother. Poor thing, she's all alone. We're the only ones she knows. It's our duty to comfort her. Compassion has always been your foremost virtue. A good local wine, please. Apulian wines are too heavy and sweet to serve for dinner. Normally they are mixed with dry wine. May I suggest a bottle of our own vineyard? I'd like to try one. Of course. You've always humiliated me with your compassion and understanding. Frederick made you lose your judgment, I saved you. Frederick made me happy. Happiness is not about giving in to passions... to urges. Urges!? Excellent. Superb. Sweet enough for my wife and dry enough for the roast. Do you know that Frederick and I made love for hours... and I enjoyed it, I enjoyed it. I was happy. He wasn't, he killed himself. Only here one can relish sun and peace. It becomes tougher to find both. How true, Professor. Laetitia. Please help me. Oh, god. Why Giulio? I don't understand why. Why? Why? Sadly my wife does not speak your language. Sometimes... words are not necessary. In some cases, a word can be a terrible weapon. You shouldn't have come here. Did you hear? I'm Professor of psychology. But Margit doesn't trust me much. My wife thinks that we psychoanalysts are contemporary witch doctors. Do you really think one should not deny oneself anything? No. Only by relinquishment we can reach dignity and inner freedom. I wrote a book on it. I saw it. Please. I'd like to be alone. Yes. Go away. Go away! My wife had a lover named Frederick. They spent a whole summer together. On a lonely island. There are 300.000 islands like that in Sweden. When it happened we were married for just two years. Why are you telling me that? Then Frederick took his life. Frederick. Why are you speaking of Frederick? Don't speak of Frederick! So she came back to me. How could I resist to forgive her? I know the psyche. Was it not my duty to help her? To give her strength... I saw it. What did you see? I saw the two of you making love. You were acting shamelessly. You would have loved to do it right there at the beach. Like animals, without restraint. Like dogs. You have worn a red bathing suit. I saw you peeling it off. But... Why did you watch? One should not just think of oneself. What about the others? Don't they have rights too? I'm sorry. My wife asks you for forgiveness. I think happiness is an illusion that vanishes quickly. It's better not to give into this feeling right from the start. What are you doing there? Don't you see? I'm trying to put up a picture. I can't adjust to the thought. What do you mean? Are you hungry? Should we eat? You can't accept it too. No. But I'm hungry. Something is worrying me. But I can't seem to remember what it is. You get old, Laetitia. No. It is something terrible, Giulio. Why did it happen? It happened... ...and I was not there. Don't send me away. Don't send me away. It happened... ...and I was not there. Don't answer it. Don't answer it. Hello? What? From Buenos Aires? No, I cannot accept the call. I understand, but I can't speak at the moment. No. Gunnar... Gunnar says that... that... Gunnar saw... It was Gunnar who did it. It was Gunnar! He did it! He did it! The rock! What rock? This one. I threw it there. Pick it up. This one. Put it over there. It's over. It's over. You... THE END
