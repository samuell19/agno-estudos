This is Ranger Station 58. 18 bombers. Altitude estimated 15,000. Course southwest. Now directly overhead. This is Mojave. Yeah, Mojave. A big bunch of planes are flying over here. They're going like San Hill and headed for Los Angeles. Yeah. Okay. Anti aircraft companies. Battery B. 52nd Monterrey. Duarte at command. 27 heavy bombers passing over here. And estimated altitude 12,000. Changing course from south to east. Warning net command to Battery B. 52nd Monterrey. Message received. Okay. Wanting net command 23rd Pursuit Squadron. Go ahead. Warning net command to Battery A. Morrow Bay. Repeat message, please. Repeat message, please. 38th reconnaissance to warning net command. Large enemy formation just sighted over Palm Springs. Southbound attackers estimated over Santa Barbara in 12 minutes, sir. Headed directly for Los Angeles. That's my ground speed. 2-6-0. Transmit enemy positions in course to all pursuit squadrons and antiaircraft units. Order 38. The reconnaissance squadron maintain contact with enemy formation over Palm Springs. - Blackout immediately. - Yes, sir. Turn your boys loose with their sirens, Chief. Yes, sir. On the roof of the municipal building, we're bringing you an eye-witness account of the first simulated air raid upon Los Angeles. Below us are the glittering lights of a great city. At play and at peace. Men and women are - There go the blackout sirens now. Turn out your lights. Pull down your blinds. Automobiles, please switch off your headlights. Stand by your radios for further instructions. Los Angeles is now rapidly blacking out. You there. In the drugstore. Turn off that neon sign. Turn off your headlights, Mac. 35th Pursuit Squadron reporting. Successful interception effective westbound formation. We estimate all enemy units will converge on Los Angeles in eight minutes. Order all remaining pursuit squadrons up to intercept. Yes, sir. The attacking bombers are approaching the city from many directions. Parachute troops are being dropped on the outskirts. Here come the bombers now. You can probably hear them. There go the pursuit planes. Here comes the attack now. And believe you me, we can be thankful the explosions are up there. And that they're not real bombs. The raid is over. The lights blink on again. Once more of the city takes up the tempo of normal life. No homes have been shattered. No fires sweep the gutted streets of a murdered city. No terror or sorrow fills the upturned lives of helpless civilians. For the United States is at peace. But these realistic maneuvers are a convincing guarantee. That American soldiers and citizens alike intend to be prepared. We return you now to our main studio. One moment please. We have a bulletin here. An Army Flying Fortress bomber en route back from maneuvers is reported to have crashed in the desert. North of Marsh Field. And here is another bulletin. The fate of the crew is not yet known. And officials refuse to comment on the unconfirmed report that a woman was found dead in the wrecked plane. Charge one. Violation of the 84th Article of War. Specification. In that Jefferson Young, second lieutenant, Air Corps. Having received a lawful command from Capt. Everett Mercer, Air Corps, his superior officer, not to attempt to take off from the scene of an emergency landing in a Flying Fortress airplane, did near Spring Canyon, California, willfully disobey the same. With the result that injuries were sustained by the crew. A passenger was killed. And the airplane destroyed. Charge two. Violation of the 96th Article of War. Specification. In that Jefferson Young, second lieutenant, Air Corps, did at Marsh Field, California, admit an unauthorized passenger, one Sally Vaughn, on board a Flying Fortress airplane. In violation of existing regulations. And to the prejudice of good order and military discipline. How does the accused plead to Specification Charge One? Guilty, sir. What is the plea to Specification Charge Two? Guilty, sir. That's not true, sir. Any further interruption will necessitate your removal from the courtroom. Sit down. You have no further statement? No, sir. Court will be closed. Let me see the record of the accused. You must be crazy. Aw, skip it, Al. You're fixing yourself up for good. Let me take care of that. Guess I must be seeing things. I thought I saw Carolyn. Listen, Jeff. I'm not going to let you toss out your job for my sake. I'm gonna go in and tell 'em the whole story. One chirp out of you and I'll break your neck. Well, gentlemen. Here's the record. Jefferson Young the 3rd. Lawrenceville Preparatory School. Yale University. Applied for Air Corps training and was admitted to Randolph Field two years ago this spring. Give me your attention. Down here at Randolph, they don't care who you are or where you come from. The Army is only interested in two things. Can you fly? Will you make an officer? And they'll find out. And we upperclassmen will try to help you learn what we've learned in the last four months. Before you report to the flight surgeon for a physical recheck, take a look at the man on either side of you. Go ahead. Take a good look. In four months, one of you won't be here. Report to your squad leaders. Dismissed. One out of three washed out. You two ought to toss a coin to see which one he's talking about. Oh, he's talking about me. Regulations say you can't be over 6'2". That's just what I was when I enlisted. But I grew a half-inch waiting to be admitted. Good morning. The boys will be out flying pretty soon. You scared of flying? No, sir. Scared of not flying. I know just how you feel. I'm Col. Riley. First man to go up in a free balloon. 1879. Went up on half an hour's notice. All they told me was to drop sandbags. And I dropped them. Floated 800 miles in five days. When I gave my report to President Ulysses S. Grant. I said the air. The air is the thing. It's here to stay. I hope I stay with it. Well, son. If you run into a stall, just call on me. I've been giving the Army expert advice on training young pilots for the last 40 years. - Hello, Sandbag. - Hello. Aren't you a new cadet, mister? Yes, sir. You're supposed to be the hospital taking a physical recheck. Aren't you? Yes, sir. Weill, take off. I'm going to dress down that young upstart for not saluting me. That's all, young man. Yes, sir. Song you got the makings of an officer and a gentleman. Thank you, sir. Hey, you better quit stalling. And get over the flight surgeon's office for that recheck. I'm going. You fellas passed, huh? Why not? Nothing the matter with us. You sure are lucky. I don't smoke. I don't drink. I don't break training for four years. And what happens? I'm overgrown. You know, I had the same trouble. Till I find out if you stand at attention for a while. And jump up and down, you can maybe jog a half inch off. Yeah? Sure. Jockeys do it all the time. Do you mean like this? Yeah, only higher. Oh. Well, fancy that. Say, uh, uh. Ludlow. Al Ludlow. Cassidy. He's a polo player. So what? Named what? Oh, yeah. Jeff Young the 3rd. Eight goals. He's filthy rich, Ludlow. Eight goals and eight mission bucks. Is that the way they rate him? Say, tell me, Young. What is a tough guy like you want down here anyway. Here's a good place to find out fast just how tough you are. Oh, well, I don't have to find out. That this is what they gave me for being the toughest guy in the Big Ten. Too bad they don't have cheerleaders down here. Yeah. Yeah. And here's the shoe that kicked the winning field goal against Notre Dame last year. When you get back from the flight surgeon's, I want to show you my baby pictures. Aw, swell. If you get back. Yeah. Well, come on, baby. Bounce. Bounce. Oh. Oh yeah. I wish I'd known about this before. I could have been doing it in the train coming down. I see where it's going to be awful noisy sleeping in the Hall of Fame. Say, Ludlow. What did you do before you came here? I was a mechanic. Worked in garages. Airplane factories. Sold. I tried just about everything. Well, uh, where'd you get your two years college equivalent? Trade school? Never stayed long enough one place. I got a satchel full of diplomas from correspondence schools. What brought you down here? I want to fly. As it would be. Say, uh. They really wouldn't wash a man out for a half an inch, would they? Sonny, down here, they wash you out for a bad haircut. Turn around. - Straighten up. - Oh, yes, sir. Ohh. What are plans after you graduate, Cassidy? Oh, applying for a commission. Get a job with an airline, maybe. I suppose that - You mean I pass? You mean I'm only 6'2"? You're six-two and a half. But since you added the extra half-inch after you enlisted, I guess it's on the Army. But don't grow anymore. Our airplanes don't stretch. Aw, I won't, sir. I mean I won't, sir. Ha, I passed. I passed! My clothes. I forgot my clothes, sir. What's the matter? Don't you like your mechanic's outfit, Mr. Jeff Young the 3rd? Hey, I'm in! Hey, fellas. I'm in! I made it! Hey, 82, out, 82, 54, hike! That's the play that made me famous. Taking out two guys at the same time. As you were. What? Where do you misters think you are? At a freshman rally? This is the Army. We expect you to act in a military manner. Size? - 13. - 13? That'll have to be special issue. Left face. Right face. About face. Right face. - Right face. - Left face. Forward, march. To the rear, march. Forward, march. Left - - March. - Left... - March. Right, march. Good day. You're turning too fast. Don't forget air speed until you stall into a spin. Now recover from your spin and try it again. Be seated. Take off at will. What's the matter, mister. You sick? No, uh. No, sir. I made a terrible mistake. What's that, mister? I thought they taught you to fly down here, sir. They do. You'll meet your flying instructor tomorrow. Oh, swell. Cadet Young, sir. Cadet Ludlow, sir. Cadet Cassidy, sir. Cadet Masters, sir. Cadet Wilcox, sir. Now we'll drop all that. I want you to relax. This is an airplane. I'm going to teach you to fly one, I hope. This is the ship will start out on. So let's climb aboard and look her over. I'll tell you everything I know about it. All I ask is your strict attention. I expect you to make mistakes. But don't make excuses. That's the stick. That controls things. You move it forward, your nose goes down. You pull it back, your nose comes up. These instruments and controls look complicated. But a week from now, they won't. Your flight instruments are in the center. Bank and turn. Air speed. Rate of climb and altimeter. All right. Any questions? Good. You, Young. I'll take you first. All we do this morning is to shake hands with flying. Begin to feel at home in the plane. Get familiar with the sky. Get into your chute. Buckle your belt. All right, Young. Follow me on the controls. Lightly. Lightly. We're flying. Not hauling a load of cement. You may be good enough to come this close, Cassidy. But I'm not. Get off the roller coaster, will you, Ludlow? Confound it, Ludlow. Hold your speed constant. If you're gonna dive her in, dive her in. If you're gonna stall her in, stall her in. But don't vacillate. You can't learn accuracy without a constant glide. Land shorter this time. Stop using the whole field. Fly the airplane, Ludlow. Don't let the airplane fly you. Here come Al and Mercer. One. Two. Three. Four. It ought to scramble those eggs Mercer had for breakfast. Yeah. Hey, Jimmy. Chalk up a buck against Mr. Ludlow. Four stars coming up. Your Ludlow is way out ahead in the Dumbbell Derby. Oh, what difference does it make how good or bad you are. They don't set us up to for solo. Yeah. Well, maybe they're going to wash out the whole battalion. - Hey! - Hey! As you were, mister. As you were. Oh, hey. Four stars. Pay up a dollar for the kitty. I'll pay you up in the room. Okay. We ought to make you a wholesale price. You use too much rudder on a left turn, you feel the wind on your right cheek. You don't even it up, you feel it on the other cheek. What am I doing here anyway? This is no place for a dumb mechanic. Don't take that attitude, Al. Shucks, I'm dumb too but. What the heck you can't buck nature. Young. Yeah. On the line. Right away. - Solo. - Okay. Got it? Huh? Jeff's gonna solo. Hey, fellas, Jeff's gonna solo! Jeff's gonna solo! Break the ice. Fly the pants off that thing. We're rooting for you. Don't hog me, boys. Give me air, will ya? Don't think too much. Just relax. Go out there and show 'em. Give 'em the old power play right through center. And remember, keep your head. Don't worry about me. All I got to do is this. Climb a little faster. And glide a little further. Don't get nervous. I'm not nervous. No. What do you got that flying suit on backwards for then? Huh? Come on. Let him do it by himself. He's a big boy now. Gimme the other arm. What are you thinking about? - Young. - Yes, sir. Come on, Young. You're going out to solo. Not to get married. Yes, sir. Good luck, Jeff. Thanks. Ya. Boy oh boy. Flier. Mickey. Oh, would you mind? You're casting a shadow in my reflector. What's the matter? Haven't you ever seen a bomber before? Never with landing gear like that. Aren't you making kind of free with that camera around an Army Post? Look. I'm trying to make a series of pictures. For a national magazine. With full permission and cooperation of the United States Army. We'll set up over there for the next few pictures. Okay, Miss Bartlett. Bartlett. Bartlett. Bartlett. Oh. See here. Carolyn Bartlett. I know you. Photography's dynamic symmetry girl, yes. Kansas corn silos. Steam turbines. Private eyes on the blast furnace, sure. Yes. And I must say I find you even more interesting than Junior Bergman. Oh, no no. As you were. Hey, dopey. You're in clover. She likes class poses. You know her? Do I know her? Come here. Miss Bartlett. I'd like you to meet Mr. Cassidy. How do you do? How are you? Can I help? At what? Yes. Would you like to hold my reflector for me? Oh, yes, ma'am. Here. Mickey, give it to Mr. Cassidy. And get my other camera, will you? Okay, Miss Bartlett. Hang it over here. Now there you are. A little more. Come on. Some more. Now that's fine. Now you just hold it there. Cassidy. Cassidy! Here, sir. Hold that, will ya? Now's your chance to get a picture of some real flying. My instructor can't wait to get in the plane with me. It gives him a chance to catch up on his sleep. Oof. You know it surprises me every time that guy gets off the ground. Really? He seems rather capable to me. Yes, sir. You're wasting time. You stand by to meet the ship when you're scheduled next. Yes, sir. In the back. Take me out to a practice area and show me some improvement. Yes, sir. Cassidy. Your progress is a fair average. You're a little bit on the cocky side. Just in case your head is getting a little bit too big for your buttocks. I'm going to show you a couple of things that you'll have to learn very soon. This first is what we call a slow roll. Check your belt. Okay, sir. Stop. All right, Cassidy. Climb back to 3000 feet. We'll do it again and you'll follow me through on the control. I said climb her back to 3000 feet. Lt. Clankton speaking. Hello. Flying Cadet Cassidy wishes to report he just fell out of an airplane, sir. All right. What?! You men who have soloed are starting to feel like pretty hot pilots. During the past week several minor violations of flying regulations have cropped up. One pretty serious one. So go easy on trains. Cattle. Individual combat. And outside loops. That's all. Cassidy. Cassidy! Oh, yes, sir. Stay with us, will ya? Yes, sir. It's a good thing that big dumbbell's a natural born flier. You men that haven't soloed it yet. I'd like to offer you a little tip. The Army has just so much time to devote to finding out whether each of you is a flier or not. So make every minute in the air count. That's all. Ludlow. I want to see you a minute. Would you say that I know my business? I think so around here, sir. And why am I losing out with a man that's got everything it takes to make a flier? What's on your mind, Ludlow? Family? Money? Women? Just tell me I'm through, sir. I can take it. Why don't you forget her? I don't know what you're talking about, sir. I think I do. I can't forget her. I keep seeing her the way she was the night we busted it up. I keep hearing her say you're a flop. You'll never be anything but a $15 a week grease monkey. I was sore too. I told her to beat it and she went. And with another guy. She said she was going places. And she will. The quickest way she can. After that, I threw off my job and pulled out. Things weren't going to be going so well. So I kept telling myself. It's just bad breaks. But after a while I began to wonder. Maybe it was me. I always wanted to fly. That's one of the reasons I joined the Air Corps. But it was more than that, sir. You see I have to know about myself. If I wash out, then she's right. I never told that to anybody, sir. Suppose she is right. I know a lot of swell guys that are $15 a week grease monkeys. Now the trouble with you is that you're trying too hard. Relax. Stop tensing up. It's part of learning to fly. The big part. I know that, sir. Ludlow. Look. Fliers are just like all other men. And they fall into the same two groups. Those that women have made happy. Those that women have made unhappy. But whether they're lucky that way or not. They just keep plugging along at their job like everybody else does. Now if you can't forget this girl, don't. Stop trying. But get this through your head. You can still make a whale of a flier. Ludlow. I'm sending you up for a check ride with a flight commander tomorrow. I've told him I thought you'd make a pilot. I still think so. Now don't make a monkey out of me. Catastrophic instability is a characteristic of an aircraft, which having deviated from level flight tends to increase the deviation. Look, Jeff. I've soloed, haven't I? Now why do I have to learn this junk? You want to know what you're doing, don't you? - Jump. Eject? - Yeah. You're want over at Lt. Roger's office right away. Ha, he must need some expert advice. Cadet Young reporting, sir. Perhaps you know about Miss Bartlett's presence at the post, Young. Yes, sir. She's looking for someone to photograph as the average cadet here. You've been selected. Me, sir? You will cooperate with Miss Bartlett whenever it doesn't interfere with your duties. Miss Bartlett is a very charming girl. It was nice of her to select me. But Miss Bartlett didn't select you. The Army did. I came down here to be a flier, sir. Not a model. Did you ever see any of those screwy pictures she takes? Mr. Young, we didn't call you here to give a class as an art critic. This is official. Yes, sir. I'm so sorry to trouble you, Mr. Young. It's no trouble at all. Now would you mind stepping over by the window? Hmm. Turn your profile into the light. A bit afraid of the mouth. And the line of the jaw there. Oh, dear. What do you think, Mickey? Lean over so he can see. I don't think the chin's gonna do it. What was the name of the cadet with you yesterday? Cassidy. I really feel it that Cadet Cassidy might be more suitable. That's all, Young. Send Cadet Cassidy over. Yes, sir. Now look, dopey. Catastrophic instability is the characteristic of an aircraft which having deviated from... Hey, I think I got it now. Catastrophic - - Yeah. What's the matter? Maybe I'm crazy. What's the matter? They want you over at the public relations office right away. Masters, would you take this Greek god to Ronson's office. But don't chip the profile. Come on. Hurry up. They're waiting for you. The Lady of the Lens is on the loose. Oh. Ohh! Lady of the Lens? Ha ha. Come on, professors. Come on. He's going to be the great lover of the Air Corps. Roll up your flaps, will ya? That's nice talk to a hot pilot. You're in a class all by yourself, aren't you? That's what they tell me. Just watch me up there for a while and maybe you'll solo too. Aw, come on, Al. Put it in the hanger. Gimme those. I told you to lay off. Hey, you can't quit now. I'm on the deck. Ludlow. Break it up. Break it up. You're supposed to be a gentleman down here, Ludlow. You're not in the garage now. You don't have to tell me where I belong. Or what I'm going back to. But before I go, I... Lucky he caught you, mister. They wash you out fast down here for striking an upperclassman. Now what's this all about? Who started it? I did, sir. We had a little argument. I got sore and I popped him. I don't blame him for losing his head. You report to the orderly room with proper uniform to walk a punishment tour. Yes, sir. You stuck your neck out, mister. But you're in enough trouble. We'll miss it this time. That's all. You don't have to take any wraps for me. I'm a real chump. I hate to see anybody get washed out before they had a chance to do what they came down here for. What's the difference? They'll send me up in the washing machine tomorrow. I'm sorry I put the rib on. I know just how you feel. That's a laugh. How can you know? You've never been in a storm in your life. No? I've been in a storm ever since I came here. Every time I walk down that flying line. And see those faces, they nearly drive me nuts. 300 guys all daring Jeff Young the 3rd to be as good as Joe Doakes. I never figured you were afraid of anything. I tell you something else. The louder I talk, the more scared I am. That's strictly between you and me. Here. Try wearing these tomorrow. They were lucky for me. Keep swinging, Al. You still gotta chance. Now watch me talk as I'm out walking the tour. Would you look up please? Thank you. Can you suggest any other points of interest, Mr. Cassidy? Ludlow. You're next. It's gonna seem funny not getting in with these anymore? What are you talking about? The seat of those pants will be worn out before you turn that chute in. Yeah, I'm not kidding myself. I picked Grady. Collins. Anderson. When they send you up in the washing machine, it's a one-way ticket home. The flight commander's ready for you now, Ludlow. Come on. Climb in. I can't do it. I know I'm through. Why do they have to drag it out? You're not through. So why lie down and quit? I'm not a quitter. I know when I'm licked. Give me out of this thing. You report to that flying line if I have to smack you down and carry you there. You came here to fly. You're gonna fly. Now dump that flight commander into the ship and ride the pants off him. Come on. Hey fellas, congratulate me. They just passed me on my... pylon eight. What's the matter with him? Only bad news out there. The worst. Yep. Did you hear him cry on his pillow last night? He's a funny guy. Yeah, you're funny too. Like a wing breaking off. - What did I say? - Oh, shut up. Cadet Ludlow reporting, sir. Ludlow. Before I send you up to the flight commander, I want you to take the ship up alone. Alone? You heard me. He's going up solo. Come on, Al. Allah, be merciful. He's in trouble. Takeoff. There's a BT in trouble beyond the south end of the field. My motor's conked. Get the nose down. Get it down. Gotta keep flying speed. Pick a field and relax. There's one. No good. It's downwind. Find another one quick. Only got 400 feet. Come on. I can get in that one. Turn now. Don't change your mind. Turn. Relax. Loosen up. That field's small. Have to cut those treetops and fish later. Cut in a little soon now and stay high. You can kill altitude. But you can't get it back without your motor. Keep flying speed and relax. Now fishtail her. Still too fast. Once more. That's better. Okay. Level out. Drop her in. Don't dive at the ground. Careful. Careful. Don't hit those trees. You have to switch before you hit. Maybe I can ground loop her. Hit that left brake. Hit it. Ha ha ha ha. Are you all right? Sure. Okay, was it? What happened, Ludlow? Motor conk out on you? Yes, sir. You got plenty of gas and the valve is turned on. It must have been a vapor lock. Well, we can fly her out of here. We'll have to truck her. I don't know how you got her in here without a shoe horn. Well, Ludlow. Now you see the value of knowing how to make a short approach. Yes, sir. Not a scratch. Is this a student you were going to send up for a wash-out ride? What wash-out ride? That's Navy stuff. Dunking the last guy to solo. I never heard of them doing it down here. Course you didn't. I just made it up. Scrap this. Nice going, Al. Nice going. That's setting her down on the dime, Al. Congratulations, boy. You really did it. How is Number One? Thanks. They turned the trick. Go ahead. Keep him. That landing was one for the record, Al. And they used to call him "knucklehead." Yeah! Store's closing. Checking off this reservation to spend our first weekend in San Antonio. We're gonna pop all the beer joints. Oh, gee. I can't go with you. I got a date. Oh, gosh. I'm late now. Go get my suit creased. Ah, ha ha ha. Now do you understand catastrophic instability? Yes. Ha ha ha. Don't forget this war dance is on me. We'll settle that later. Oh, no. I just drew a month's pay. 75 bucks. I'm showing you the bright lights. - How many please? - Two please. Two? Si. Hey, look. The center throws me the ball back. And I get it and I tuck it underneath my arm. Let's break up the whole thing. I'm right on your tail. Well, well. A woman's work is never done. What pose is this? Life-like flying cadet? Occasionally, I come out of my darkroom and see Al. That's fine. Do you mind if we try to liven up the party? Not at all. Now, waiter. Two chairs please. Yes, sir. Coming right up, sir. Oh, excuse me. Miss Bartlett, this is Mr. Ludlow. The hottest pilot in the class. - How do you do? - How do you do? Mr. Cassidy was just telling me the most fascinating story. Do go on, Mr. Cassidy. Oh, yes, about the time he had the ball on the two-yard line. Skull fractured. No. No, it wasn't a fractured skull. It was a broken rib. Oh, that's right. How silly of me. Quiet, please. You see he's tired. Irritable. Overworked. Overexposed. Look. How about my having this next dance? Certainly. If you can find someone to dance with you. Ha ha. Oh. I love is hungry for a chance. Of romance. For I was born to love. They ought to put that on the menu. Yeah. How'd you like to meet her? Oh, no. You just wait here and I'll show you how it's done. - Excuse me. - Certainly. Jeff. To be true. They insist. For I was born to love. If I could find just the one I belong. I would call it a day. Get him to stay. And then get older and it's gone. And gone. My love would be a lovely thing. How'd I sing. For I was born to love. Shall we? Darling, I never dance with a customer. If you dance with me, I'll put you in the Air Corps. Fine. I don't think I'm the type for wings. Oh, I think so. Say, who are you? Jeff Young. Now I know you're crazy. So. It's fourth down. We got 98 yards to go for a touchdown. Now then. Should I play safe and kick or should I take a chance and run? I said, should I kick or run? Well, how many men on base? No. Strictly speaking, behind that guy's back, he's kind of conceited. Yeah, certainly. Tom, would you like to dance? Hmm. Yeah. Are you really Jefferson Young? Just Jeff to you please. You don't look like your pictures. I'm sorry you're disappointed. I'm not. You look just like you should. Got me all figured out, haven't you? Yes, I think so. Smarter than I am. I never know what I'm gonna do next. Oh, Miss Bartlett. I'd like you to meet Miss uh...? - Vaughn. - Miss Vaughn. How do you do? You sang beautifully, Miss Vaughn. Thank you. Who's that cutting in on your girl? Oh, that's uh that's Tom Cassidy. My girl? Who says she's my girl? She does. With her eyes. Aww. You're way off your course. My life would be a lovely thing. How I'd cling. But I was born to love. No. Really? Say, Al. I'd like you to meet Miss Vaughn. She was born to love. Mr. Ludlow. How do you do? You two dance together. I have to make a separate pass. - Hello, Al. - Hello, Sally. Well. That's a warm welcome. Layoff, Sally. It started all over down here. Why'd you follow me for? Don't flatter yourself. I'm down here with the band. Okay, Al, if that's how it is. That's how it is. You messed up my life once. That's enough. Don't worry. I struggled along without you. I just hope you find what you're looking for. Is that really Jeff Young the 3rd? Don't waste your time, Sally. He's way out of your league. Think so? Is that you, Tom? Tom, can't make it today. The average young American is boning for navigation quiz. But if I can be of any help, I'd only be too glad to. Provided you don't shoot around the chin. Thanks. I think I have about everything I need. - You mean you're finished? - Mm-hmm. Then what do you do? Go home. Where is that? San Antonio. No kidding? Really? That's fine. I'll be over Saturday afternoon. You'll find me photographing some bananas. I'm going to Guatemala City tomorrow. Guatemala City? I wish I'd known you were leaving. I'd been a little more... well I uh. Yes? Uh. You got my pictures yet, young woman? Yes. They're over here, colonel. Why don't you take off in a balloon? They're excellent. Creeping up on the enemy. They won't be dry till tomorrow. Well, I can wait. Oh. What's that? I have to take some negatives out. Well, be careful. No light in here. Hey, ever tell you about the time the Comanches were surrounding Fort Conner? No. I spotted them in my balloon. And down I come on them raining sandbags. You know, colonel. I hear there's a full dress review on the parade grounds. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Well, somebody ought to tell about these things. I can't keep a whole army waiting. No. Bye. Look. Do you have to go to Guatemala? Just working girl, you know. I have to go where they send me. What's Cassidy doing in that one? This one isn't Cassidy. I don't remember seeing him around here. You ought to know him. You see him everyday. He's no glamor boy. His ears are too big. But he'll make a magazine cover, just the same. That's a good face. A good home-made tough face. There's a lot of moxie there. You'll never see this baby goose-stepping in a colored shirt with his arm outstretched. Quite a guy. What's his name? Yankee. Joe Yankee. He's a composite of a lot of the cadets down here. They didn't have my chin. Might be. It was a funny thing. I've got a composite picture too. A girl. Miss America. In the green smock. Always got her hand in hypo solution. Knows all the angles. And waits for the benefits. That's rather cute. Can I kiss you? - Mm-hmm. - Mmm. Oh, darn. And every time I try to have a good time in this Army, a bell rings. Grr. Ohh. Well, I - Say, that's fine, Mercer. Congratulations. Thanks. I'm turning my students over to you. You know most of them. Ludlow. Wilcox. Young. Front and center. Lt. Hopkins is going to be your flying instructor from now on. I didn't know you were leaving us, sir. He's just been named Flight Commander. - Congratulations, sir. - Thank you. - We'll miss you, sir. - Thanks. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Cassidy and Masters are still upstairs. They'll probably be in in a minute. Hey, look out! Get down. Get out of there. Clear the ship before it explodes. Get going. Come on, you men in that trash truck. Bring those extinguishers in here. What do you think killed the motor? Cover the gas tank. Here's another gas tank. Easy, fellas. Let him rest. Are you coming around? You're okay, buddy. Take it easy. I'm sorry. It's all right, man. Sorry. Sorry for what? For avoiding a collision? For saving another man's life? How about you? Are you all right? My hand's just a little burned. Young. Take Ludlow over to the hospital. Have them take care of those hands. Thanks. I'm all right. All right. Come on. Oh, nothing very serious. They'll be all right in a couple of days. Go ahead. Say it. You know I let you pull Masters out alone. They all know it. Now what are you talking about? I just got there first. Sure. You just got there first. Couldn't find him. He came back here for about five minutes. Changed into his civilian clothes. And left. Did he say anything? Yeah. It doesn't make sense though. I hand him a couple letters from Guatemala. Addressed to Jeff Young the 3rd just as plain as day. So he says he isn't the guy that they were written to. And he tears them up and throws them in the wastebasket. You didn't save me the stamps. Come on. Get me your laundry. All present. Good night. Where do you think you're going? Into town. Don't be a dolt. Why stick your neck out too? I got to find him. That guy's in a real storm. My love would be a lovely thing. Promising. For I was born to love. Hello. That. Now I know why I came down here. What took you so long? I was trying to be a flier. But you won't be if they catch you down here on a weekday night. Eh, let 'em catch me. I'm through. I'm no Joe Yankee. Who? If I want to fly, I'll buy a blimp. You can buy anything you want. Yeah. Anything but wings. Look. Stick with me tonight, will you? Don't leave me alone. Come on. Let's get out of here. Johnnie, tell the boss I'm leaving early tonight. Yes, ma'am. Well. Isn't it kind of late for you to go around ringing doorbells? They told me at the Colonnade, Jeff is with you. Eh. Well, if it isn't old Al. Take a seat, cadet. Take a seat. Have anything on the house. Nothing's too good for a hero. Joe Yankee. The hero of the day. Or will it be wave my hanky, wave wave wave? Ever hear of Joe Yankee? He's kind of a cross between Sir Galahad and and Daniel Boone. He's full of moxie. We'll talk about that tomorrow. Right now, you're going back with me. Oh, no, I'm not. Sally and I are taking a little trip tomorrow. She isn't looking for Joe again. Jeff Young is good enough for her. Plenty good enough. Yes. New Orleans. Sun Valley. Mexico City. That's it. Mexico City. See the world while it's still here. Sal. Here's to us. Ice. For my drink. Not my head. Lay off him. You're getting what you want down here. Why shouldn't I? You want his dough. I couldn't be on the level, could I? You never were with me. Tell him to go back to the field. You must think I'm crazy. I'm always wanted to go to Mexico. Listen. How long do you think it would last? Jeff's no dope. What happens when he sobers up and find you there? A cheap little gyp with her hooks in him. You tried that once before and got into a lot of trouble. Now tell him to go back to the field or I'll spill. Just try it. Colder than a well digger's ice box. Jeff. Have some flask. Let's dance. Jeff. You better run along before you get any more trouble. Why don't ice cubes come in single packs instead of in litters? Jeff, did you hear me? Yes, I heard you. We're taking off for Mexico. And planes don't leave from Randolph. Let's wait until you can fly me there. I'm no flier. That's Al's department. He's got it. And I haven't. Don't make me laugh. Come on. It's getting pretty late. Oh. So you're running out on me, huh? You're one of these hot and cold propositions. I'm not running out on you, Jeff, honey. I'll be waiting around. I can tell you really don't want to break away now. You wouldn't be happy. Uh. Well. Maybe you're right. You're a good kid, Sal. You're all right. Come on. Let's run along now. You gonna call me in the morning? I promise I will. Early? Early. All right. Good night, Jeff. That was smart, Sally. Not you or your whole Army can take him away from me. And don't you forget it. Nice kid, huh? Yeah. Wipe the paint off your puss. Really? Hmm. Kelly Field, here we come. The finest food in the Army for four miles. Maning. Oh, forget the food, knucklehead. Capt. Mercer never did like your snap rolls. Well, he wouldn't wash us out in a final check. He taught us all we know. Don't let Hopkins hears you say that. Just think, Al. The fastest ships, cross countries, night flying. Yeah. And a pair of wings. Aw, this is going to be a cinch. We're practically at Kelly now. Flying Cadet Young, reporting for final check, sir. What do we do, sit this one out? Climb on to traffic to 2,000 feet into a practice area. Show me gentle, medium and speed banks. Putrid. Putrid. Alright. Alright. Show me some slow rolls. How did I ever get myself a job like this? I can't stand anymore. Take me home. Raunchy. Very raunchy. I hate the pass you men on those rides. But we have to get somebody to Kelly. By the way. The next job you take, young lady, better be close to home. Like photographing the San Antonio Water Works. You miss me? Missed you? The day they turned me loose on cross-country, I almost made it non-stop to Guatemala. Why'd you turn back? It's rather lonely down there. Oh. Mr. Camera must be slipping. I thought he kept you too busy to be lonely. Maybe my mind wasn't on my work. Let's finish this dance from the terrace. Hey, Jeff. You're wanted on the horn. Huh? Telephone call for you. Well, tear it up. I'm not taking any calls tonight. Jeff. You'd better take this one. Oh. I'm sorry, Cally. Will you excuse me? Yes, certainly. You know Mr. Cassidy. You're wasting your time in the Air Corps. There's a distinguished career waiting for you in the diplomatic service. Yeah? Hello. Hello, Jeff. Why haven't you called? Well, I was busy. Well, you can't be so busy. I hear there's a dance out there tonight. It's just a small party. Our last night at Randolph. I can get away early. I think I'll drive up for a while. I wouldn't do that, Sally. Why, Jeff, it's been weeks since I've seen you. Now Sally, I thought we've been all through this. I thought you were going to be intelligent about it. What does that mean? Goodbye. Good luck. We've had our fun. You go your way. I'll go mine. Don't try and sell me that routine, Jeff. I wish I could think of a better ending but I can't. No? Maybe I can. I want to see you tonight. Sorry, I made other plans. Listen, Mister Jeff Young. You drop up to my place after that dance. Or I'll start making a few plans of my own. I'm expecting you. Attention. Orders. Headquarters. Flying Cadet Detachment. The Air Corps Primary Flying School. Office of the Commandant. Randolph Field, Texas. Detachment order. Order Number Ten. All existing appointments of flying cadets as officers and non-commissioned officers in the Flying Cadet Battalion are revoked. And the following appointments are announced. Effective upon departure to Kelly Field at 9 a.m. tomorrow. To be Senior Cadet Captain, Flying Cadet Ludlow, A.H. Congratulations, Ludlow. Al, they picked a good man this time. Yeah, but he was just getting to be a good guy. Now he has to start playing grandma. A very stylish landing, mister. You know it's funny. When I came down, I wasn't even looking at the field. Think I can get a job around here the beacon? I have a better idea. Tell me something, Miss Bartlett. Yes. How is it nobody ever married you before I will? I don't know. I suppose it's because of the funny kind of life I've made for myself. I think really it's because nobody has to make me want to give it up. Could you give it up for me? I know I could if. You were just Lt. Young. Not Jefferson Young the 3rd. Gee, I'd have to live your way. Can you wait for me? I think it frightens me just a bit. Well, don't worry. After I get my wings, I'm not going back to Long Island. Wall Street. And those tired coming-out parties. I'm staying with the Air Corps. For good. Well. I guess I am too. Ho hum. - Good night, darling. - Good night. Hey, wait a minute. You shouldn't be out here this late, Sally. It's against regulations. I can tell them about a few regulations you've broken, Mr. Young. Get in. Never mind that. Sally, you and I are through. Our account is closed. Is it? Oh, come on, Grandma. Button on your bust and let's get going. On the double, old lady. Come on. All right. Bye, boys. Just don't let me lose you in the turns. That's all. Ho ho. A skipper from Randolph. Yeah, Capt. Mercer. Well, hello. Certainly glad to see you, sir. Oh, you've been laying for me, huh? No, sir. You weren't as tough as all that. Well, I see all three of you are still here. Yes, we're still here. We proved that flying is safe. I guess you have at that. Are you transferred over here, sir? No, just over here on business. I've been assigned to a Flying Fortress Squadron next month out at Marsh Field. You know. I'd like to have you men in my outfit. If you're assigned to Bombardment. That's where we really separate the men from the boys. Well, that lets Cassidy out. As you were, chump. You know how glad I am to see you three finishing the course. I'd like to give you one more piece of advice. You're at the peak right now. Hot pilots. Out in the service, you will run into older pilots. Old fuds like me that aren't what they used to be. You can fly rings around them. But have a heart, boys. Break the news to them gently. What's an "old fud"? That's what Grandma's going to grow up to be. One more week and I'm second lieutenant with wings. 45 minutes of safe and sane flying behind Grandma here and we're through. You do you want me to do, dive on the colonel's quarters? Oh, no. We wouldn't think of it. What, hop a hedge? Why, that's against the Scout's code. Grandma, huh? All right. I'll give you guys a workout. Now they'll wash me out for this, won't they, Jeff? What sort of a racket is this anyway? Graduation Day and they throw out the best man on the class. For something he was no more responsible for than I. Just because you were the leader. Everybody hedgehops once in awhile. We egged you into it. Tom happened to be the one who slipped up. I am responsible. If you listened to me, we could have cooked up a story. Don't you think I felt bad enough about lying out of it? And you didn't do me any good when you horned in on the blame. Almost got yourself washed out too. So what's the difference? I'm quitting anyway. Fed up with their kind of discipline. They can have it and take a running full-twist into the lake. Aw, cool off. You'll feel better after they pin those wings on you. Wings? I'll hang 'em in my trophy room. Where do you get off, talking like this? You got no beef. It came down here polo-playing drip. And they made a flier on you. I'm sorry, Jeff. Look, Jeff. You're the best friend I've ever had. I just don't want to see you go off your nut. I'm washed up. Sure. Just wasn't in the cards for me. We both want something when we came down here. We both felt the same way. And if I'm not in the Air Corps, I want to know that you're in. But you got the thing we both wanted. And you earned it. The hard way. That's something your money won't buy. Something bigger than you or me. Stick with it. Jeff. Come on. Get going. You got to fly that review. See you later. Al. Wait. Al. You can't go like this. Ah, the more speed, the better the takeoff. Jeff and I have plans for you. Well, thanks. I'd rather be on my own. Where are you going? It's a big country. Tell Jeff so long and to stay on the beam. He'll know what I mean. It's from both of us. Thanks. How many aviators do you kiss, sister? Sally, stop it. Try and make it. I know. I read about you and Jeff. A big military wedding for a dress affair. Now you don't want to go out there, Sally. Oh, don't I? I'm tired of being pushed around. So they're giving him his wings? They won't dare when I get through. I'll give them a scandal that'll shake the Army. I'll tell 'em a bedtime story they won't forget. Al, let her go. Jeff hasn't seen her in months. That's your story. He's seen me lots of times. How do you think I got his car? Let go of me. Jeff Young can't pick me up and drop me without seeing where I'm gonna land. I'll make him marry me. Sally, be sensible. You can't make anybody marry you. Can't I? Who do you think I am, Snow White? I'm in trouble. Jeff gave you kind of a rotten deal, didn't he? I'll say he did. But I'll make him squirm. I'll take care of that pal of yours. He's no pal of mine. Not after the way he kicked you around. Well, I'm through being kicked around. I don't know what's the matter with me. I don't want to hurt anybody. But they're always hurting me. Look, Sally. Jeff's got another half-hour in the air. No sense starting anything till you had a talk with him. I think you need a drink. I'll say I do. Might be able to fix something up. Why aren't you up there? They washed me out. Wouldn't you know it. The same old Al. You and me both make a couple of - also-rans. Come on, Al. I need that drink. Going up? Not yet but I will be in 10 minutes. - This came for you, sir. - Oh, thanks. Where's Miss Bartlett? Back at home. Well, if you see her first, tell her I'm looking for her. Oh, there you are. I've been looking all over for you. Carolyn. Al's gone. I just got this. Oh, no. What made him do a thing like that? Can't you imagine? No, I can't. I had no idea - Jeff. Have you been seeing Sally? Yes, I have. She threatened to go to the commandant. I wanted my wings so... I saw her. I gave her a check. Do you think that takes care of everything? What did you expect me to do? Jeff, one can't use a checkbook for a conscience. What's that got to do with us? A lot. I've had a swell time on my own, Jeff. I've got to know what I'm giving it up for. Look. Just because Sally - She was here this afternoon. I spoke to her. And so did Al. What did she say? Don't you know? Al drove away with her. You wouldn't be getting your wings today if it weren't for him. A pleasant thought, isn't it? Jeff, I wonder if you're worth what he did for you. No, I'm not. Lawrence, P.T. - Thank you, sir, - Congratulations. Mr. Lawrence. Thank you, sir. Wilcox, D.A. - Congratulations. Mr. Wilcox. - Thank you, sir. Young, J. Congratulations, Mr. Young. Thank you, sir. Arden, M. - Congratulations, Mr. Young. - Thank you, sir. - Congratulations, Mr. Arden. - Thank you, sir. Rutherford, D. Quinn, A.J. Why, Mr. Vanessa. And me, a respectable married woman for six months. Sure, I like it. I'm up to my elbows in diamonds and down to my knees in silver fox. Cut the clowning, Tony. Haven't you got a spot for me at the Paradise? I don't wanna trip to Florida. I want a job. I know. They got big oranges in, Florida. Un-uh. Doctor told me to stay in Kansas City. Smoke's good for what I've got. Vanessa. Okay, Tony. Skip it. I guess you and I don't think alike. I'm sorry I bothered you. The wolf. He was a nice kid when he was a barber. Czar of the numbers racket is something else. - Did you ...? - No, nothing. Don't bite my head off. I just wanted to know how you wanted your eggs. Scrambled. It would've been a commission job anyway. Don't kid me, Al. You didn't want that job. You don't want any job. Except flying. I told you I was through with flying. How about cooking those eggs? No, I'm sick of cooking for you. I'm sick of this cheap dump. I don't have to stay here. I can skip any time I want to. You think the baby's stopping me? Well, there isn't any baby. There never was. I knew that, Sally. Then what did you marry me for? So you didn't want to help me. You didn't care anything about me. I didn't matter. What a sucker I've been. Trying to make a go of a two-cent marriage while all the time you're grandstanding for a guy named Jeff Young. It's on me, isn't it, Al? Where's the ship we borrowed from Hamilton Field? Over in Hangar 2, sir. They just pulled her in. What about that turbo supercharger on 32? Another two hours, sir. That's just dandy. So they sent us a B-17B, huh? How about 32? She going to be ready on time? Not for another two hours at least, sir. And all we've got is 20 minutes. Good thing we sent to Hamilton for a spare. We'll have to use it. Did she come down with a full enlisted crew? I don't know, sir. I was just on my way to check. We better find out. I want to go to the crew that came with it. - You can relieve those men. - All right, sir. All right, sergeant. Tell your men to knock off. We won't use that ship. Crew chief? Up front, sir. What's the rest of your crew? They're getting something to eat, sir. I can have them back in five minutes. Al! How are ya? Gee, you're looking great, fella. See you're still with it. Where you been? I dragged the whole country for you. Did you? Oh, I am I moved around pretty much. How is Sally? Well, last I heard, she was in Florida. Been through worst stuff, you know. How's Carolyn? Oh, I haven't seen her since graduation. She's up north somewhere. I keep myself too busy to think about her. Say, crew chief on a bomber, that's doing all right in a year. Oh, acting crew chief, sir. You know, expansion. Oh, don't give me that "sir" stuff. By rights, I should be taking orders from you. - Young. - Yes, sir. Come meet your commanding officer. What's wrong with the emergency release? The door doesn't drop, sir. Air Corps supply won't have parts until tomorrow. Well, Ludlow. Can't stay away from it, can you? Well, if I can't fly them, sir, I can at least polish their wings. I'm glad you're back with us. Thank you, sir. I'll go get the report, sir. It gets in your blood, doesn't it? There's a man who should be flying. Hmm. Can we do something, sir? And I've got a friend or two in the chief's office. Cases have been reconsidered before. Right now, we've got other things to do. She's all ready to go, sir, except for that emergency release. Well, we can't ground the ship for that. Take care of it first thing tomorrow. Yes, sir. Oh, sir. This test is a new type of experimental flare on the way back tonight. But don't install it in the bomb bay until all the flares have been released. Say, Al. I spoke to Mercer about another crack at Kelly. He said he'd go to bat for you. Do you think there's a chance? You know Mercer. If there's a chance, he'll swing it. - You really think so? - Sure. Look, right now, I'm racing to a pilot's meeting. But when I get back tonight, we have a lot to talk about. Where can I find Lt. Young? - Al. - What are you doing here? They followed me here. The police are out there now. Get out of here! But, Al. I'm your wife. I'm in a jam. A bad one. Tony Vanessa's dead. Somebody killed him. They said I did it. Did you? No. Did you? Yes and I'd do it again. You were born to kill somebody, Sally. Hit me. - Hurt me. - Shut up! You can't stay here. But I - You've always helped me. You've never let me down. You got any money? Here. Take this. When you see your chance, step out of the hangar and get back to Los Angeles. Will you meet me there, Al? You're on your own, Sally. Al, please. I don't know where to turn. I got to talk to somebody. Please. Tomorrow night, Al. Please. All right. All right. I'll meet you at the bus station tomorrow night. They must have turned me out labeled "sucker". Now get out of here. We're taking off right away. I'll see you tomorrow night, Al. Al, they're here. Al! Al! Here we go again, boys. We're on our way. The old man says we're going upstairs. Here we go to play war games. Yep. But it feels real this time. There's supposed to be an air raid tonight. You all right? Navigator to Commander. Drift correction. Two degrees left. We're 45 seconds ahead of our last checkpoint. Put the manifold pressure back to 23 inches. Navigator to Commander. Over Monterrey. Anti-Aircraft Company. Battery B. 52nd Monterrey. Warning this command. 27 heavy bombers passing over here. At estimated altitude 12,000. Changing course from south to east. Navigator to Commander. Over Santa Barbara. Directions to 32nd Squadron. Extinguish your navigation light. Hold your altitude at 12,000. Navigator to Commander. Estimate over Glendale. One and 1/2 minutes. Shows Los Angeles blacked out. Bombardier to Commander. Objective visible. Mercer to 32nd Squadron. Squadron approaching objective. Bombardier, stand by to release magnesium bombs. And trail on assigned target. Bombardier to Commander. Opening bomb bay doors. Directions to 32nd Squadron. Formation 3000 feet above preparing to attack on our left. Squadron change formation. To Javelin down. All combat crew members, maintain battle stations. Here we go. Mercer to 32nd Squadron. Enter overcast. Use regular ascent procedure. Rendezvous on top of overcast. Mercer to 32nd Squadron. Proceed individually to simulated occupation of dispersed airdrome. Head for Muroc Dry Lake. Simulate occupation in about ten minutes. Better get those experimental flares installed. Yes, sir. Tentative results from GHQ, sir. VS-1 to WMZ. VS-1 to WMZ. Commanding General First Wing. GHQ Air Force, Marsh Field. White Pursuit MP... Al. Al, get me out of here. I can't stand it here. I can't breathe. Let me go up front, Al. Are you crazy? Do you want them to see you? Stay right here till I come and get you. And stay put. Al. Look out for those flares. In fifteen seconds, they could blow us all to glory. Understand? Al, I can't stand it in here any longer. I can't! You will. I'll knock you cold. Al, don't leave me. Al! Live flares! Live flares! Live flares! Live flares! Live flares! Open the bomb bay. Open the bomb bay doors. Bombardier. Open the bomb bay doors. Hit the emergency release before it explodes. Close this. What was that? Where's the throw? Straight. We got it. Keep going. He caught it. He caught it. Get out that chute. We're going down. Are you crazy? That's against all regulations. We're going down. Capt. Mercer. Capt. Mercer. He has serious burns, sir. And head injuries. Looks like internal injuries too. I'm afraid he's dying. Adrenaline, quick. Yeah. You're a fool. Water. Who taught you to land a plane in the middle of the night in this spot? Like this. Alcohol. I didn't. You're pretty seriously hurt, sir. We have to get you to a hospital. You're staying right here? Jones. Right here, sir. Contact Marsh on the main transmitter. Tell them we're staying here. Yes, sir. Never mind that message. They'd okay it at Marsh. We'll never get out of here. That ridge. We're taking off. Anybody like to stay? All right. Get that stretcher. Yes, sir. Be careful. Easy now, fella. All right. Set him down here and get him covered up. Check. All right. Give me all the manifold pressure she'll take. Heads are frigid on the one constrictor blade. Drop that flap or it tears the engine out. She won't pull seven. Line's busted. Keep trying. VS-1 to WMZ. VS-1 to WMZ. Ship's vibrating violently. Well, our wings are still on. Prepare for crash landing. Prepare for crash landing. Making crash landing. Making crash landing. All right, men. Get in here! Try pumping it. Pump it quickly. Are you all right? Sally. Hold it. Jeff. Oh. I say. Make it go away, Al. Thanks. Thanks, Al. This isn't hurting. No. A really swell guy. Oh. Sally. She got on the ship. She was in trouble. Yeah, I loved her. I couldn't help it. Lt. Young said the court would never believe that I didn't know my wife was aboard the ship. He said I'd be finished for good. I never get another chance. If he knew he had to go but. There was no sense in both of us taking it. That's why he pleaded guilty. To shield me. That's all. No further witnesses. The room will be cleared. While the court deliberates its verdict. Good luck. Why, Carolyn. I heard about this and thought you might want to see me. Thanks for coming. I'm here to stay this time, Jeff. If you want me. Yes, I want you. But they're about to tie a tin can to my tail. It doesn't matter. Maybe not to you. But it will to a lot of people. Darling. A lot of people will never know what you've done. But I know. I'm proud. No matter what verdict they reach in there. I'm proud of you. On the specification, charge one. Not guilty. The court finds that Lt. Young's decision to disregard Capt. Mercer's command was justified. Under the extraordinary circumstances. Capt. Mercer's life was at stake. And Lt. Young had a reasonable right to doubt the binding nature of a command given by a man so gravely injured. On the specification, charge two. Not guilty. Goodbye, Jeff. Good bye, sir. Ludlow. You made a monkey out of me once at Kelly. Don't do it again. I won't, sir. Can I get a kiss? You wanted wings, mister? Go get them. Blow hard, lieutenant. You're a big boy now. Into the air, Army Air Corps. Give 'er the gun, pilots true. Into the air, Army Air Corps. And the wings will see you through. And the wings will see you through. Subtitles by: Mondo @KG
