Hey Don Bosco, these are utopias... the world is done like this There are poor people and there are rich However my dear, something should be done Still I don't see it clear, but I am sure that with the help of God, something I can do What do you do? What do you want? Have you come to help in the Mass? No, I cannot do Then... what you have come to do here? Now, get away, get away, who told you to enter the Sacristy Tony, Tony Listen, don't send away that boy Come back Come back Come here, come here Hey Tony, is this the way to deal with my friends?

Nothing Bad deal... now I will get you something for Sundays Do you know how to read and write? No Do you know the catechism? Well, you must know to do something? Do you know how to sing? Yeah Yes, finally! The 1st Oratory was born on December 8 that year from that meeting with that boy sent by the Providence... in few months... (Boys singing) Wonderful! Now, let us go out to play Just a moment Stop It is now six months since we opened the Oratory and I don't tell you the situations that your happiness have given to me Especially those football players but let us agree something: I don't want to see sad faces but also broken glasses, eh are we agree now? Now go to play, go See Borel, this is a new thing for you since some years ago I thought about it I understand, Don Bosco Will you help me for now? You will need a lot of patience and good lungs Just look that... Hey I told you not to enter that place that's not our yard How can I tell you? Blessed boys Sorry Reverend, are you Don Bosco? The inspector of Palace Gate would like to talk to you immediately, if it is possible The inspector? Yes In order to understand the fact to justify the gathering of 500 or 600 boys I have here denounces of honorable citizens that feel disturbed by the behavior of your boys or those guys, as you prefer to call them I will read you any here this one I inform you His Excellence that the current day a group of boys led by a priest have invaded and ruined a field of my property for a lost of 245 lire another one I inform Your Excellency that a garden.... a garden has been invaded by the boys as far as 100 meters still another one very dear where is it? Here it is I have demonstrated that the harvesting in my property has been completed it is supported by all these accusations Dear Father I am ready to the highest indulgence, but I guess that all these peoples and complains will create tensions with the municipality This municipality has demonstrated to now how to care with so much commitment the civil order and social discipline It is not hate that promotes me but the defense of immortal principles that are the foundations of a modern nation nothing avoids us to think that this priest loyal to the politics of the temporary powers has all the intentions to transform at the first opportunity these homeless boys into conspirators For this reason I propose formally to proceed to make a search at the house of Theologian John Bosco Just look how they reduced my room and you said nothing? What should I say? When I saw the more compromising letters that are debts, I proposed them to help me pay, but they did not accept Come on What is up now? Come here Oh, the Filippi brothers Rev. Fr. John Bosco It has been a very difficult day for our Oratory (The letter says that the owner of the land gives to Don Bosco 15 days to leave the yard, because the neighbors are complaining.) A moment Yes No, no... I don't want to disturb you Come on A moment Reverend, they told me that you were looking for a new place for your boys Yes, true, why? Because I have my land here nearby with a canopy... maybe could be your house Oh It is right near here we could pay a look Thanks, I go immediately Here Don Bosco, your boys would be protected from sun and raining My land is until there Then to that line then it is this wall it is big, right? yes, the land is okay but this canopy here... it needs to be repair I understand the good will It is an occasion for the boys, carpenters, to do something But the house was not enough... the boys would need a mother. Don Bosco brought Mamma Margaret, who left her native house Come on, mom here we are look, mom, what do you think? Is it big, right? Yes, big, but it lacks everything here lacks everything? it lacks comfort, but... the essential is here and then look at here... here She is look how beautiful she is with Her help and your help you will look how all here will be transformed Get up and let me do look how it is done do you see? From that modest workshop more rich in Faith than in resources comes the origin of that poem of the Professional and Agricultural Schools for the world Salesian School of Agriculture Salesian Printing Press - Turin It was enough the means of the first printing press to spread the thinking of the Founder for the youth expressed in the PREVENTIVE SYSTEM I read your book, Don Bosco and I appreciate your theory but I have my doubts on its practice Your Excellency, I am here to give you a demonstration the proposal to lead 300 inmates from prison has produced fear in the authorities have you thought in the kind of responsibility it takes? If there is any fugitive, for example? Don't worry, His Excellence, there will not be a fugitive I request you not to send also guards I want to assume myself the responsibility trust in me, His Excellency Okay, I will please you Hey boys, today myself and the guards take a rest Don Bosco got from the Ministry the permission for you a full day of freedom Order, order but let us be clear day of freedom that will end exactly at 5 5... is it clear? I want to give you only one recommendation think on the great responsibility the great responsibility that he assumes Is it okay? Now well, bye Don Bosco and may the Heaven help you Warning! No, thanks Come here with me with joy As you see, still 5 missing you are too optimistic, Reverend you see in this fact a simple late Instead I see a real escape I remind you that I know those young men I can't get that they would like to escape for me, it is useless to wait now my inmates, that I know better than you, I am sure will not come back Instead I am sure they will be back That's okay, so wait for them here Good evening and good luck I have a lot experience for many years but the day you will miss what would become your works? Yes, I would like to form a group of persons following my style living now with me at the Oratory but if the government is suppressing many religious orders and it is thinking to suppress even more how could we think to create another one? let me do... I know very well the law of suppression it does not let any opportunity but it is enough that you form a society where every member keeps his civil rights be submissive to the laws of the State pay the taxes and... it's over The Oratory of Saint Francis of Sales In the room of Fr. John Bosco called by him and he is present in meeting with Fr. Lazonati Vittorio Angelo Savio, Deacon Rua Michael, Sub-Deacon Cagliero John French Johan Battist Rovera Francis Livarello Carlo laser Joseph John Bonneti Cerrutti Francis Celestino Durando, Cleric with the goal to keep the real charity required to run the Oratory for the abandoned youth and in danger for this reason, they agreed to live in society On December 18 of the Year of the Lord 1859: 22 Salesians, 1 house 1935: 20,000 Salesians, 200 houses millions of students and past pupils 18 years after the foundation of the Salesian Order, in 1972 Don Bosco completed his educational program founded the Daughters of Mary Help As in Oh, it is you Oh, Don Bosco, another travel? Yes, but this time I will not going to do it do you remember that dream I had long time ago? of those wild people, in far and mysterious lands that at the presence of our priests, they through away the guns they knelt and prayed with them at the foot of a great Cross? Yes, I remember it very well It is many months already I was asking to the Providence for enlighten. about the meaning of that vision now my prayers have been answered look at it... read The consul of Argentina invited me to send our priests in Patagonia In Patagonia? There the Word of Christ still to arrive but it will be our mission to send it there We need courageous young men with enthusiasm and full of Faith I have said that it is neccesary couraoug young men full of enthusiasm and full of Faith for this reason I have chosen you that I have chosen you, Cagliero You, Fagnano, Catini, Tomatti and Aladena and you, lay brothers and masters of song you, even if you are few you will be as a small seed of the Bible that will produce a big tree Go... still I recommend you one thing with special attention the painful situation of many Italian families living dispersed in that land for those that the misfortune or misery have brought them to a foreign land be as brothers On the path of those first missionaries and sisters, came many others, bringing civilization and Faith To the program of the organization, miracles came Many foreign cities disputed the honor to welcome the Italian Salesians, welcoming Don Bosco as a saint See... now even to walk I have to make it with you Dear Street soon you will have to do things alone I am already tired but take a little rest rest? my real vacations are near to start Oh, Don Bosco, what are you saying? To Don Bosco still to make a good conclusion sit down, Street and don't get afraid the fatigue and the sacrifices will be many but think that here we are on the small Pinardi's house where 40 years ago my mom entering the door and looking around very worry said here lacks everything she was right but She was already there ready to welcome us to Her I have spoken morning and evening and everything done it's Her work even what it is to be done and what you will do and the others after you will be Her work the Oratory, the workshops, the school, the missions will be multiplied and you will be thousands and moving cities and land, your good works will come you look at me as 40 years ago when some persons thought I was mad but you know that I was right believe me... the key of the secret it's always this one... work and pray work and pray From all serenity of the "good conclusion" all sons in the world knelt down in humble prayer. On January 31, 1888, at the first hours of the morning... 40 years after, on April 1, 1934, Pope Pious XI, canonized Don Bosco.
