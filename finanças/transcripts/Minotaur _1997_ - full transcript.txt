Perfection itself. Not me, the music. Well, that is the mystery of Mozart. But his life was less than perfect, right? No. He said his peace. He wrote his requiem. He died at 34, was buriedin an unmarked grave. That is not only a mystery. That is a crime. Take it again, please. Good morning, Mr. Barudi. Consider it done. I'll see you on Wednesday. I think I found my coat. MAN : Can you clean it? I don't know yet. MAN : How about tonight? Maybe. MAN : Good luck. Yeah. WOMAN 1: He wanted what? WOMAN 2: Music sent to him. WOMAN 1: That's upstairs. SALES CLERK: Can I help you with something? THEA: Yeah. Hi. I'm looking for Mozart K.488 with Brendel and St. Martin-in-the-Fields. For some reason, it's been on order for weeks and it just doesn't come in. I do have Jean Bernard Pommier with Perlman. It's quite good. Yeah. Well, I think I would really like to try to find the Brendel one. Sorry. We don't have it. - All right. Well, thanks anyway. MAN : Lost and found. I've lost my coot. MAN : Relax. Take a steam bath tonight. OK. You look good, Alex. This steam did wonders for you. So whose toes did I step on this time? No one's toes, simply rules, Alex. Things went smoothly. That's your complaint? You're too much of a maverick. That's my complaint. Oh, Nahmi. Listen, Alex. Some people feel that yourcover has been compromised. Some people are wrong. I don't know about that. It is safe, Nahmi. Maybe. I know where is. I know. I've been given complete discretion on this one. I choose the team. I'm available. Oh, you better be, Alex. Because Barudi is just the beginning. He's Masudi's executor. Once he's out, you'll beable to get to Dr. Kesler. You know he was once shortlistedfor the Nobel Prize in Physics? Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah. He's a very noble guy. He'll sell his soul to the highest bidder. And his soul will lead us directly to Masudi. ALEX : My work brought me to the town where you live. My work is a series of surmises,assumptions, and risks. I chose this work, because Inever loved anyone, except you. Although all my life,I've been trying to love. I can offer no explanation, other than what I'm about to tell you now. For as long as I can remember,I've been searching for you. I knew that you existed, but I didn't know where. You'll never have anopportunity to ask me questions. But my voice will reach you through my letters. And I know that you read them. I've devoted my life totough and disagreeable work, because I needed to love. Therefore, I loved the country I served, her mountains, her valleys,her dust and despair. I acted as I did through lack of choice. I didn't know if I would ever meet you. THEA'S MOM: Thea. ALEX : And now, nowthat we've met, it's too late. What a baby. ALEX : There'sbeen a mistake, in dates and places and everything. I'm quite sure that it was me who was intended to be tormented, not you. Anyways, It's far, far too late. Can you hear me? I love you. I've loved you all my life. Don't be angry. Don't take pity. I never knew happiness, until I found you. Hi. Hi. WOMAN 3: Sorry to be late. He's really, really strange. What do you mean? Like weird strange? Or like interesting strange? No, no, no. More like mysterious strange. What do you mean? Mysterious, as in full of mystery. I don't know. Well, I don't think it's mysterious at all. Check out Jock Boy, 11 o'clock. It's got to be him. That guy? I'm telling you. That guy has been gaga for you forever. There's this girl. She's in my class. She knows him. I think he's an economics major. Huh. For a numbers guy, hewrites pretty good poetry. That guy writes poetry? Excuse me. Hi. Hi. Hi. I'm G.R. Hi. I'm Thea. Yeah. I know. We need to talk. Well, now? I act-- No. We could actually-- Go out some time? Actually, how about tonight? At 9:00. I'll pick you up. OK. It's OK. I know where you live. You do. Right. OK. I'll see you at 9 o'clock. OK. Bye. Bye. It's a great place. Yeah. I know you like Spanishpoetry and that kind of thing. So-- I suspect I'm not alone. My father is from Cordoba. I know. I can't believe I'm finally out with you. I'm glad it-- itwasn't far, far too late. What does G.R. stand for? If I told you, I don't think you'd want to go out with me again. I thought we were never supposed to meet anyway. Granville, Granville Rhodes. My parents thought an unusualname might build character. It certainly did. Why economics if you havesuch a gift with words? Excuse me? Come on. I know it's you. What's me? THEA: The letters, these incredible letters. What about them? Excuse me. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Where's the ladies' room, please? Thank you. G.R.: Would you come to themasquerade ball with me? THEA: Yeah. Sure. So you really like these letters, huh? Yeah. Well, thank you for an amazing night. Thank you. It was great. Yeah. All right. All right. Good night. Bye. ALEX : You're my greatest loss, a loss that was recoveredonly when it was too late. Believe me, if you and I are what I think we are, there's no need for us to force the issue. Today, I give you this bookof etchings of a Picasso. Listen to the stories that are there for you. Listen close and tell me, can you hear the beating things inside? Thea, I dreamed about you last night. Hi, baby. Hi How you doing? Did I get any mail today? No. Just newspaper, regular stuff. Why? - Oh. Nothing. ALEX : I had to do it. Not to learn something aboutyou which I didn't already know. Perhaps it was a childishwish to look into this room and find that I was right. You belong to a world that I've lost long ago. You're not my mistake, Thea. In my work, I must nevermisjudge people's characters, because if I were tomake a mistake even once, I might have to pay for it with my life. If I had been wrong about you, I should have been dead a long time ago. We can't meet. And we can't be united. I do not fear for myself, Thea. I've learned that I'malso dangerous to be near. I am a man with two hearts,and only one will survive when all is said and done. As the said, THEA : Why are you so sad? Please, don't be angry if Itell you that I can't accept your lunatic explanation that all your life you have been waiting for me. If you really have, then you are truly insane. But you're not insane. I know it's not true. In which case, what are you? I've been reading yourletters for almost a year. At times, I wish you'dnever started writing to me. Now, I want you never to stop. ALEX : Are we cutting class today? THEA: You scared me. Sorry. I'm just tired. What's up? Nothing. I-- Ugh. It's your secret mad letterwriter again, isn't it? Are they still coming? Yes. Almost every day now. You know, this guy could be a weirdo. No, he's not like that. How do you know? I just do. MAN : Hello? Mr. Barudi? MAN : One moment, please. MR. BARUDI : Hello? Do we really go toschool with so many people? I only recognize half of these faces. Dude, I don't play requests-- usually. That fan is the perfect touch. You would say that, wouldn't you? No, no. I mean it. ALEX: May I have this dance? Do you mind? No. No. I-- I'll get us a drink. WAITRESS: Hi. Hello. What beer do you have? WAITRESS: Heineken. - Perfect. Great. WAITRESS: All right. , please. That is a truly fine piece of machinery. Thank you. I used to own one. Really? Mhm. What do you drive now? A Lamborghini, Countach. But I still keep my GX for the city. I would give anything todrive a Lamborghini Countach. You like cars, huh? I love cars. Well, your 308 is nothing tosniff it, once you get to know. What do you mean? With a few tricks, your 308 can give you as much performanceas you'd ever want. How long have you had it? G.R.: Actually, I just got it. It was a graduation gift from my dad. Have you opened it up yet? I'm sure could be openedup a little bit more. ALEX: You're right. There's a way to completelyopen her up quickly. And it only works on that Ferrari. Really? Really. What do you do, G.R.? Well, like I said, I'm just about to graduate. ALEX: What's your major? G.R.: Economics. ALEX: Sounds serious. G.R.: Well, yeah. It is. I mean, I am. How about you, George? What do you do? I'm a financial planner. So you like-- like, youplan people's futures, right? Yes. You may say so. G.R.: Cool, cool. So a car like this must get you plenty of attention from the ladies. Am I right? Well, I-- I don't know. You know? I'm-- I'm seeing someone. So I hadn't really noticed. You're a lucky guy. G.R.: Well, it is. You know, she's amazing. I hope to marry her some day. Young man like you, ready to settle down? G.R.: Yeah. She's incredible. I-- you know, I don't want to blow it. Yeah, you might want toslow down here a little bit. I'd, um-- I'd bring it down a little bit. Just-- just bring it down a little. I think I got it. I got the hang of it. You can bring it down a little bit now. Jesus. I'm sorry, but I have toleave you by the next phone. I'll find my way back. Don't worry. G.R.: Are you sure? ALEX: Yeah. I'll be fine. It's all in there. You can get the same out of her. Yeah. I'm going to. All right. G.R., do me a favor, stay on the highway. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Hey, thank you. I hope to see you again, have a drink sometime. Yeehaw. Come on. Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. Let's go. Move. Come on. Keep it moving, buddy. Keep it moving. Let's go. Keep it moving. Let's go. No. We shouldn't be having this meeting. I shouldn't have agreed. We're losing time and I have no time. You have as much time as we give you. Things are right on course. I want to meet Kesler now. It's time to close in on Masudi. Set it up. We may be old friends, butI think you forget yourself. I want to finish with it now. That kind of talk worries me, Alex. We have to wait. I've waited long enough. An now, it's time. This is what we do for a living, we wait. It's what our damn business is about. You don't go after them.You let them come to you. It's different now. Understand? Will you set it up? Please. All right. But we involve nobody else. I'll back you up myself. Thanks. Darling, look what just arrived. Aren't they beautiful? Thea? I'm going to make some lunch now. And don't forget, you promised you'd take a walk with me this afternoon. The fresh air is gonnado us both a lot of good. ALEX : It was alla mistake, Thea, like my life. I've no right to bother you with words now. And I certainly have no rights to send you any unnecessary reading. I know that you have wordsthat you need to say. So that's what I suggest. Put your letters to mein an envelope marked Mr. Franz Kafka, post restante, and send it to your local post office. I'll be there to collect your letters. Post restante, please. Great. Thank you. Is it you? Is it you? I know you're here. Do you like watching me, Mr. Kafka? What for? You're a coward. You're dead. You're nothing. You're dead. You're dead. You're dead. THEA : Where are you now? You can't remain silent forever. You can't hide anymore. I don't know if you had a hand in G.R.'s death, but I must leave, run awayfrom you, from your letters, and from everything that'sso miserable between us. I'm not as wonderful as you make me out to be. Look how you dominate me. So many times I was amusingmyself with the thought that you might be around, very close. Now, I'm doubting if you really do exist. Are you safe there in the shadow? It's OK. Stay in hiding. It's easier. You're afraid because of me, right? Because you don't want me to get hurt? Well, I don't mind getting hurt. I don't mind being touched. Come on. Come on. Step out. I'm here. Mr. Milan. You took care for the money, Mr. Milan. We've opened aconfidential account at Swiss Central Bank in your name. I must have absolute assurance. There is the account number. It could be a false account. Call them now to assure yourself. The bank's number is 473-6409. Please. Phone, please. Thank you. Please. Customer service, please. Private accounts. Yes. My account number is 96610992. I would like to know the status of my account. Yes. Yes, Rudy Kesler. Yes. Thank you. I'm impressed. And now, Dr. Kesler, the goods. The goods. These are the last photographs of him. He has changed. Where is he now? Claridge Hotel, New York. And now, Mr. Milan, let's drink to progress. You continue to lead the good life and I as well. May we all receive what we so richly deserve. Cheers. Dr. Kesler. Mr. Milan. Please. NAHMI: We're almost there, kid. Hold on. Hold on, Alex. Hold on, kid. We're almost there. Who is it? KIM: Thea, it's Kim. Oh my god. Hi. How are you? Wow. Wow. You look great. Oh. I-- I wasn't expecting anybody. Apparently not. Oh, come in. You want anything to drink? We're getting drunk. That's enough. That's enough. So have you even left theapartment since you got here? I go to class. That doesn't count. Yes, it does. You didn't get any moreof those letters, did you? No. Have you met anybody nice here? No. I've been really busy. KIM: No. You've been keeping yourself busy. There's a difference. I'm not against going out with someone. It just hasn't happened yet. Thea, you have to make something happen. You know that. Look, this is what you're gonna do, OK? You're gonna out. You're gonna find a boy. Then, you're gonna ask him ona date for this Friday night. Well, Friday I have aguest lecture in the morning. Then, I have to go to class. Then, I have stacks of work, because I have a paper due on Monday. I'm fine. I-- I'm fine. Good morning. It is a beautiful,clear July day in Grenada. The year, 1936 . The phalangists occupy thecity, but the mood is mild. It is on that day that FredericoGarcia Lorca, poet, playwright, artist is executed and his body is thrown into an unmarked grave. He was 38. There are those who look upon the death of Lorca as a much greater symbol ofthe conflict of that region in general, not the political conflict, but the deeper chasm towards utter brutality that lies in man. The wrote, One body with littleblood, but with two hearts. Is that to say that there isnot enough blood in the body to keep two heart alive or that two hearts can turn thin veins into a nurturing river? We have to keep an eye on thoseopposing hearts, because-- Yes, come in. Dr. Treanda? NICOS: Sit down. I'll be right with you. My heart is in the East, butI am at the edge of the West. Then, how could I taste what I eat? How can I enjoy it? You're familiar with HaLevi? Yes. So you are here in responseto my plea for an assistant? Sure. I'd be delighted. LECTURER: Wonderful. I have the paper for theChicago lecture on Wednesday. I checked all the references. But I wasn't sure about the you wanted-- - For the opening. - Yeah. You marked a few. So-- We're all done. I don't think that I shouldkeep you waiting any longer. No. You shouldn't. Hello? ALEX : Thea, it's me. I've been shot. And the only reason I'm stillalive is because of you. I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hear your voice. This is as close as we'll ever get. Anything else is just impossible. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I love you. I want you to come with me to New York. I want you to meet my mom, my friends. I want you to know everything. You're sure that's what you want? Yes. You're sure? Yeah. Cause you shouldn't stay withme if you think I'm half a man. You deserve better. You deserve better. I want you. I want to get on with my life, our life. Thank you. TAXI DRIVER: Thank you very much. Thank you. Scotch, please. Hi, Mom. Hi. Hello. You look wonderful. This is Nicos. Oh. This is Mom. How do you do, Nicos? Very nice to meet. Oh, it's good to meet you. Well, I'm glad you two found each other. She really needs somebody. Mom, should we show Nicos to his room? Oh, yes. And I put some warm blankets outin the hall if you need them. And there's some clean towels in the bathroom. And your mail's up on your desk. All right. Nicos, you're teachingSpanish literature, correct? Yes. ALEX : Thisis my last letter to you. I know that we should meetand the hour is not far away. You've never sinned against me but once. My terrible and wonderful angel, it is I alone who have broughtabout this abominable state of affairs in which we find ourselves. I was hesitant, tried tohave it my way, a coward, and miserable and despicable coward, someone who was privilegedto know of your existence before he met you, should havebeen with you all the days of his life, with you alone. But I rested on the way. I stopped off. I left signs. I left everything behind, Thea. We're so close now. No fear. No regret. Just freefall. Look at it. Look at me. The letters have come to life. I know. Go. Go. Go. I love you.
