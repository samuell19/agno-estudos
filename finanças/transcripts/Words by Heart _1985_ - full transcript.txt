(adventurous music) (birds chirping) (soft piano music) (wagon rattling) (soft piano music) - Get in there. Go on! Why don't you do as you're told? That's all I can do. (engine rumbling) (soft piano music) (crows squawking) (soft piano music) (Reverend's throat clearing) (wagon rattling) (door slamming) (gentle music) (engine rumbling) (gentle music) (crows squawking) (wagon rattling) - [Lena] I wanna go on. - [Mr. Does] All right, may the best one win. - Lena? Lena, you come on. We're already gonna be late. (dog barking) Hush, Bullet. (dog barking) You don't know them verses yet, you're not gonna learn them now. (Ben laughing) Come on. - Come on, get up, yah. Come on. (wagon rattling) (dog barking) (bright piano music) Whoa. - It's just like Tater and that little brother of his to be actin' that way. They still smartin' about Daddy's job at the gym bein' there. Now, Lena, child, this kind of contest can't everybody win, so you mustn't take it hard if you don't. (people laughing in background) - I'm sure this is going to be a fine and glorious evening, for we'll not only hear the words of our Lord, but we'll be hearing them from the mouths of our young, the future of our great country. All of you young people here in Bethel Springs will be part of that glorious future. - Thank you. (crowd applauding) Thank you, thank you Reverend Bells. And now let me introduce the organizer of tonight's contest, Jay Bird Kelsey. (crowd applauding) (Jay Bird clearing throat) - I, uh, have a prize for the winner. So y'all do your best. All right. I think it's, ah, fittin' and right that we start with the high honor student and best memorizer in Bethel Springs. Winslow Starnes. (crowd applauding) - In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. (crowd applauding) - Next. Continue where Winslow left off, or select a new chapter and verse. - And God saw light that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness. (crowd applauding) - Okay, Alma, now it's your turn. This is Alma Fenzel, everyone. - Ashes to ashes. Ashes to ashes. (crowd applauding) - And the evening and the morning were the first day. - Well, everyone knows that was Todd Brewer. (man laughing) Very good, Todd. (crowd applauding) And next is Elsie Rawley. - The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. (crowd applauding) - And our new student, Lena Sills. - Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. (family clapping) - [Boy] My son, if thou will tithe my- - Put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes. Cease to do evil, learn to do well. - Come now, let us reason together, sayeth the Lord. Though our sins be like... red crimson, they shall be as... - Come now, let us reason together, sayeth the Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. (family applauding) - To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heavens. - A time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted. (dog barking) - Well, Winslow, Lena. You've each said 50 verses and you are beautifully matched. No one could call this anything but a perfect tie if you would like to stop. Now I know this has been a fine- - [Lena] I wanna go on. - What? - I wanna go on. (crowd murmuring) - Oh, well, all right. - May, may the best one win. - Winslow, boy. Are you stuck? - No, wait. Just a minute. - Flowers of the earth. The flowers on the earth. - No, the flowers appear on the earth. The time of the singing of the birds is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land. (crowd murmuring) The fig tree putteth forth their green figs and the vine with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. (Jay Bird sighing) - Well, now, Miss Lena. Ah. (throat clearing) Well, uh, Miss Lena, you did real fine. And, uh, Winslow did fine, too. Even if he didn't win. (chuckling) (throat clearing) (crowd murmuring) Well, uh. We, uh. Have a prize here. You win the prize, Miss Lena. Thank you, Mr. Kelsey. - I wish it was just what you wanted, because, uh, you deserve. - I don't want it. (footsteps clomping) (crowd murmuring) (owl hooting) (wagon rattling) - Whoa. (owl hooting) - Here, I'll put him to bed. Ben, you can tend to the horses. Come on. - Okay. Lena, rewards don't prove you're somebody. When you're somebody inside yourself, you don't have to be told. - Well how do you know when you're somebody? - You just know. I'm somebody and I know. And you didn't have to throw Mr. Kelsey's blunder up in his face. - It was meant for Winslow Starnes. He can have it. - But you had the victory, baby girl. Wasn't that enough? (door slamming) (soft dramatic music) - Claudie! Claudie! - What? Lord, get your daddy. - [Lena] Papa! Papa! (dramatic music) - Is that all? - Is it all? Does it have to be stuck in here before you see what it means? - [Ben] Will you hush now? - Ben, it's happenin' again, just like it always does. - What's happenin' like it always does? - Nothin', Lena. Probably just some kid playing a prank. Or some trap scared off Jessie's fixin' to have himself some supper. - Ben, they tellin' us they don't want us here. - Who? - They sayin' here in Bethel Springs they ain't got no more use for us than they did back south. We never should've come. - [Lena] Who's sayin'? - We the only kind of family in town, Ben. You have already taken a white man's job. And it don't matter if you earned it. And tonight she overstepped herself, just like you always doin'. - Be quiet! - I have been quiet for six years while she was growin' up safe in Scatter Creek, and you not telling her what the rest of the world was like. Or lettin' me! - There's a time for it, Claudie May. - Well, when? (knife clattering) - Papa? Was I not supposed to win? - I'm glad you won. You won fair. - But did somebody do this because I won? (Ben sighing) - Come on. - Papa, I'm too big. - Come on, sit down here. I remember when I used to hold you on my lap. Your little feet 'bout the size of a mouse, all curly toed. (laughing) You remember that? Just after your mama died. We sure missed her, didn't we? Nobody done this tonight 'cause you won, Lena. - But Claudie said that- - I know Claudie said what she thought was true. What is true for her. - Papa? Do people want us to leave? - No. This is a good town we've come to. You know that. They took us in. The church, the school. This is big open country with room for everybody. Do you know what Bethel means? It means the house of God, a hallowed spot. - But somebody came in here tonight. - I know, but maybe somebody young or angry or scared of changes, but one person or two or even 10, they're not a whole town, Lena. - But what can we do? - Ah. Well. You can go to bed. (kiss smacking) (Ben sighing) (door clicking) (owl hooting) (horse neighing) (crickets chirping) (coyote howling) (Ben grunting) (shovel thudding) ♪ Yea, God, from whom all blessings ♪ ♪ Praise God ♪ ♪ I know ♪ ♪ Praise Him all of ♪ Hi, Lena. - Pap, won't we be late for church? - Well, we thought we'd skip today. Let everybody rest awhile. - That's funny, Papa. Bullet should be right there outside on the porch waggin' his tail, waitin' for breakfast. - Tell her, Ben. Sometimes you put off things too long. - Yeah, not wantin' to worry people. That's why I wouldn't have made a strong preacher. I guess the Lord in his wisdom knew it. Even though I really wanted badly to serve in that way. - Tell her or I'll tell her myself my way, whether you like it or not. - Get dressed, baby girl. Your step-mama cried last night. She asked to go back to Scatter Creek. - No, I won't! - Maybe we should go. - No, I won't, Papa. And you can't, either. You said last night we haven't done anything to be afraid of or ashamed of. And if you believe that, then we have to stay. (stick tapping) - Bullet's there. - What happened to him? He was all right yesterday. Did he have a fight? - I can't say. It's more like he been beat or poisoned or somethin'. - Tater. It was Tater, wasn't it? - You can't say that, Lena, 'cause you don't know. - I do know! I just know! - Lena. Somethin' always comes to fill the empty spaces. Somethin' always comes to take the place of what you lose. (chickens clucking) (door slamming) Uh, Miss Chism gave me some peach seeds to plant yesterday, and they were wrapped in this. (Ben laughing) September 12, 19 and 10. Not a week old. Uh, Ms. Chism wants you to come help her tomorrow. Ah, ah, ah. She wants to put up her tomatoes before the frost gets 'em and she's fixin' to clean up for a big dinner she's gonna have next Sunday. - Yes, sir. - Don't forget to go by the school house and tell your teacher you won't be comin'. - Papa? - Hmm? - Is Russia gonna have a war? - I hope not. - If we had a war over here, would you fight in it? - I don't know. - If they took ya it would be so you could haul manure and lift freight, not so you could kill people. - You sound like I'd be missing the best part. All the same, they had colored soldiers in the Civil War and the Revolution, too. - They did? - Hmm. - [Lena] Doesn't say that in my history book. - [Claudie] I'm talking about now. - Well, I'm talkin' about anytime. Killin' is wrong. The Lord commanded thou shalt not kill. - In Exodus does it say an eye for a eye? - Wrong just the same. I got cotton sacks to patch. - Why do I have to miss school? Is he scared of everybody? He does everything that crabby old lady says. Yes ma'am, no ma'am. Lena don't mind missin' school. - Hold on a minute, Lena. - And what about Bullet? Do we have to let people like Tater break into our house, kill our dog and then try to scare us back to Scatter Creek? - Hush! I think I better set you straight about somethin', Miss Lena. We all work for that crabby old lady, and you better not let your daddy hear you call her that, neither. She our boss. Sure, your daddy is scared. You don't know the first thing about what's bothering him, do you? He's thinking about leaving. Do you know why, Miss Magic Mind? No, you don't. You worried about missing a few days out of school, like that meant somethin'. When your daddy got a real life and death worry to struggle with. You know what it is? This is it. Your dad is a good man. He believes the Lord meant it when he said to love your enemy and turn the other cheek to them that hurt ya. What he's struggling with right now in his heart is what he do if somebody really tried to hurt us, his family. (engine rumbling) - Got some things arriving over at the freight depot, Haney. I want you and Tater to get yourself down there and deliver them over to my house this afternoon. Now give it a crank. - Yessum. - Shoo. - I think Ben would realize that you need to be in school, but you could do better than most of your kind. And an education is good for everyone, even you people. But I guess you sharecroppers are all alike. - My daddy don't sharecrop. He pays Ms. Chism rent. - All you people ever do is think about your crops and working for other people. Then you wonder why you end up working your life away and never getting any further than when you first started out. Get back to work. (engine rumbling) (horn honking) (engine rumbling) (soft piano music) (horn honking) (soft piano music) (cow mooing) (soft piano music) (dog barking) (bell ringing) - Well. - My daddy said you wanted me. - I hope you're smarter than you look. Get in here and quit gawkin'. And while you're around here, watch out for my dog Lulu. She's almost as old as I am and damn near deaf. Now I've been up since four. Can't sleep worth a damn anymore. Now when we get these here things canned and the kitchen scrubbed, we're gonna clear out the attic. Haven't been up there since Gooch died. Here. Now get me some water. Well, I'll be. Don't you know nothin'? (pump thudding) You'd think an 80-year-old man would a lot rather pass away politely in his bed instead of gallopin' down the track to catch a 3:30 train at 3:34 with the clothes flyin' out of his satchel. And not Gooch. (chuckling) He would've been 90 next year if he would've caught it, byin' any other crazy doings. (chuckling) I was 27 years younger than he was, you have to remember. And we understood each other very satisfactory. I married him for his land and he married me for my looks. (Mary Tom laughing) Eat. Must be something you can do right. (chuckling) I cooked for a railroad crew. Mmm, baked 12 pies and 10 dozen rolls a day. I still can't help cookin' 20 times more food than I can eat. (chuckling) Mmm. I eat good, don't I? My folks were dirt poor. We lived in a chicken house one winter. I said then I was never gonna be poor again, and now I got 1,920 acres of land that says I won't. (laughing) (knuckles rapping) - Good afternoon, Mary Tom. I hope I'm not interrupting anything, but I would like to talk to you, if I may. - Well, you're interrupted my lunch. Take a seat in the parlor. - Yes. - When you finish eatin' leave the dishes in the sink and go up to the attic and start straightenin' it up. Sit down, Augusta. Now, what is it that's so all fire important to bring you out here in the middle of the day to disturb my lunch. - Well, it's, it's about the church. - What about it? - Well, we'd never had a real church here, as you know, Mary Tom. We used to use the Melody Land dance hall till that burned down. Now we use the school house. - So? - So (clearing throat) I was thinking it would be a true blessing if we had a real church here in Bethel Springs. - And you want me to give you the money so you can build one? - I'm sure God would bless you for it. - I'm sure he would. But I ain't giving any of my money to no church. Gooch gave you the money to build a school house. That's good enough. Besides, I don't go to church. Why should I spend my money on something I never use? (Augustus clearing throat) - Well, I'm not mad, Augustus. You can always ask. - I'm havin' a dinner next Sunday. It's Gooch's and my 30th wedding anniversary. - I would look forward to that, and it would give us a chance to talk some more. - Well, that'll be right after church. Try not to be late. - Yeah. (footsteps clomping) - And just what in darnation do you think you're doin'? - Are all these yours? - Those? Oh, hell. I took 'em out of the bookcases when my kids moved. I needed a place to store my good dishes. - But I mean, do you come up here to read them? - We'll start on the far corner. I'm clearin' out all of Gooch's stuff and the kids' stuff. Sellin' the whole lot. Well, they could've come and got it if they wanted it. A little visit wouldn't kill 'em. I got grandchildren I haven't even seen. - Could I read your books, please, Ms. Chism? - You? Now what good do you think books would do you? - I learn things. - The devil you do. Chera Bell's Love Story. Winsome but wicked. That's what my daughter learned. Romance, romance. Now she's living over a saloon in Milwaukee with a one-eyed butcher. So much for romance. Do you know what my children are doin'? They're sittin' on their hind legs, waitin' for me to die. All four of 'em. Well, they're gonna be surprised right down to their socks. I'm gonna sell that land and spend it doing the things I want to do. (Mary Tom laughing) - Please, Ms. Chism, I'll take real the care of your books. - No. - I'll work extra and you won't even have to pay me. - No. - But why? You don't read them. They're just layin' up here goin' to waste. - I don't have to take sass from no little Miss Swell Head. Now you either do as you're told, or you can start down those steps and keep on right out the front door. (clock chiming) That no good Haney and his stupid son Tater was supposed to be bringin' my things from the depot. I wonder where they're at. (footsteps clomping) Oh. Well, I suppose you want to go home now? - Yes, ma'am, before it gets too late. - I suppose I can do the dishes. If not, you can do 'em first thing in the mornin'. Go on home now. Go on. (cow mooing) - [Henry] What the hell do you mean by that? Ain't no Sambo takin' no job away from me. - [Ben] It seems to me you and I don't have much choice in the matter. - [Henry] What the hell do you mean by that? - [Ben] I mean that the choice is Ms. Chism's. I said to her the job at the gin belongs to Mr. Haney. But she said the job belongs to who she says it does, and either I take the job or she gives it to somebody else. - And I'm tellin' you I've been workin' the gin since before you came, and I intend to keep on. You got that, boy? - Yeah, you hear my pap? - Shut up, Tater. - [Ben] Well, you best be tellin' that to Ms. Chism. And when Ms. Chism tells me, then I'll know, too. - I'm tellin' you that there job is mine, nigger! Come on, come on, boy. Come on, Tater. - [Lena] Papa. - Baby girl. I just comin' to walk you home. - [Lena] Mr. Haney sounded awful angry. - [Ben] Did he? I don't think he meant anything by it. How'd you and Ms. Chism get along? - [Lena] I don't know. She wants me tomorrow. - [Ben] Oh. - [Lena] I brought home one of the books. - [Ben] You mean she let you keep a book or just let you borrow one? - [Lena] I meant I borrowed a book. - [Ben] Did you now? That was nice to her, wasn't it? ♪ Just praise God together now ♪ - If I'd a known how rotten my kids were gonna turn out, I wouldn't of had any of 'em. None of 'em. - Ms. Chism? - Hmm? - This bird looks real sick. - Don't he, though? Gooch knew all about birds, but I don't. I'm scared of the silly things. (Mary Tom whistling) - Mr. Kelsey at the feed store might know about birds. - Well, let's just go see if he does. (engine rumbling) - Come on, get in. Right next to me. Well. (engine rumbling) (horn honking) well, I'll be swissed. You two have some nerve, if you ask me. Two days late in deliverin' my things and still no delivery. Hell, I don't need you now. I already told Ben Sills to bring those boxes. And I'm gonna pay him the same money I would paid the both of you. He's worth it. - But we're here now. - I'm leavin'. I've lost enough sleep over you two. I got me a hand now that can work circles around the two of you, and he does what he says he's gonna do. So I'm warnin' you, and I mean both of you. Mend your ways, or find some place else to live on this earth. (engine rumbling) - She weren't so rich she wouldn't talk to you like that. - Hell! (coyote howling) - Ben, you know I don't like Roy being out at night like this. - [Ben] It couldn't be helped. We had an emergency at the mill. Nothin' I could do about it. - Ms. Chism still needs me, Mr. Doens. But I did my assignment, it's right here. I need my assignments for the rest of the week. - You can copy down the assignment off the board and I'll pick a book report for you. (kids talking and yelling) - Hey, is this what you're lookin' for? - That's mine. Give it to me, Winslow Starnes. - Wait a minute. This is the best paper I've ever seen. Is it a birthday present or somethin'? - Yes. I mean no. It's, uh, Ms. Chism found it in her attic. Now give it to me. I have to go to the feed store and then to Ms. Chism's. - Well, maybe I can read it when you're done. Ask Ms. Chism if I can. - No! - Then I'll ask her myself. (kids talking and yelling) - It was smart of you, Randolph, adding second-hand goods to your dry goods store. Don't do me no harm, either. Gettin' rid of all these things. - All I got left is that a load of books and I'll be on my way. - Mmm. (horse hooves clomping) Starnes? Forget about them books. Think I'll hold onto them books a little while longer. - Much obliged, Mary Tom. - Your bird died, Ms. Chism. But Mr. Kelsey wanted you to have this. (wagon rattling) (stick thumping) - Why don't you tell me how you are, Mary Tom? We don't see each other that often. - You know how I am, JB. Same way I've always been for the past 12 years. Mean, crotchety, old woman no one in this town can stand. - That's not true, Mary Tom. - Well, I'm not talking about you, JB. You're still a fool enough to feel about me the way you used to. - And you still feel the same way about me, too. - I was young and poor. And I did what I wanted to. There's nothing that can be done about it now. It's too late. - It's not too late. Emily's been dead for three years. Your husband's been dead for 12. - And it's too late. Just let it be, JB, let it be. Please. (cows mooing) (foot thudding) I'm havin' a dinner Sunday. Would you like to come? - I'd be happy to, Mary Tom. - 12 noon. Right after church. For those of you who go to church. Now I've got work to do. (stick thumping) (horse hooves clomping) Do you think my little bird's in heaven? - Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God. - It says that? - St. Luke, just like that. - I'm glad. Poor little Goochy bird. (wagon rattling) My things! Your daddy's here with my things. Hoo-wee, look at that! Oh! I ordered from the catalog. Finally! (door slamming) (footsteps clomping) Hey, Ben? In a day or two you go over to the Haney's and get the wire and post and post hole diggers I set there this spring, if that son of a buck hasn't sold 'em already. I'm sending you over to Hawk Hill. - Uh, Ms. Chism? I sure would like to get all that cotton in before we get rain. Could you send somebody else? - Hell, I'd rather lose some cotton than the sale on that place. Since I sued that fellow west of me over that boundary, there's no tellin' what he's done. The fences could be down all over. Well, I can't show a prospective buyer that. (chuckling) - That lady sure don't take no for an answer, does she? - Don't you want to go over to the Hawk Hill place? - Well, I don't mind ridin' fence. I just sure would miss all y'all if I was way over there. You're taking Mr. Haney's job again. (wagon rattling) - You stayed up all night copying those poems? She stayed up all night. - I know, I saw the light last night. (pitcher clinking) - Roy, look what you did! - I didn't mean it! - Lena! - Now you should've moved it off the table before breakfast. (door slamming) I'll get her. (Ben sighing) Now don't want you to go worrying now, Lena. I'll go with you and help explain to Ms. Chism. - No, Papa, it's all right. I'll go by myself. I'll work extra and I'll pay for the book by myself. Please let me go by myself, Papa. - Eat your breakfast, honey, it wasn't your fault. - You omitted to tell Ms. Chism you took that book, didn't you? Oh, Lena. (Ben sighing) (dog barking) (birds chirping) - I just wanted to read them, Papa. Books are to read. They'll just ruin up there. She don't care if rats eat them. She's wasteful. She's ignorant and selfish. - She happens to own them, Lena. They're hers to do with, not yours. - But ownin' things don't make it right. People own slaves. - Still, you did something wrong, Lena. Do you understand that you did? - [Lena] No! - You robbed somebody, baby girl. - I didn't! I brought the first book back! I would have brought them all back! - You robbed me, I trusted you. I would've stood up in court and swore Ms. Chism lent you books 'cause I know you wouldn't take 'em otherwise. That's how I want to trust you, Lena. - I want you to trust me, Papa. I didn't lie to you. - You led me to believe a lie. - I want so many things, Papa, so much. - I know you do, baby girl, but you gotta get 'em the right way. I want things for you, too. For all of us. And I'm tempted sometimes. Lord knows I am. We'll just have to help each other to hold on. All right? - All right. (metal scraping) (horse whinnying) (wagon rattling) - Whoa. Ms. Chism wants me to pick up the wire and post for the Hawk Hill place. - Well, I'll tell ya. I'm planning to be using them posts and wire myself. - Well, Mr. Haney, all I know is she told me to get it, and so that's what I'm gonna have to do. - Well, she must have told you wrong. Or more likely you just heard wrong. 'Cause I've done the Hawk Hill fences the last three years, and I mean to keep on. - Well, since we can't agree on this thing, why don't you go see Ms. Chism? We on our way over there now. You're welcome to ride. - I got my own mount. I don't have to ride with Sambos. (Tater chuckling) - Well, then maybe you'd like to go talk to her about it yourself. I can wait. - You want to? - Sure. I might as well go see her, bein' you got so much time. - Want me to saddle up? - Go ahead. - What if I told her somebody stole her blasted posts and wire? - I don't think she liked to hear that. - What if I told her you stole her stuff? - I wouldn't like to hear that. - [Tater] Come on. - My hat. You might as well make yourself comfortable. I might be awhile. (Tater chuckling) - Well. - What the hell do you think you're doin'? - [Ben] I'm seeing if you got Mrs. Chism's wire and posts. - You can't do that. This ain't your place. - It's Ms. Chism's place, and I need to have some facts to tell her. I need to know I'm not being fooled. - Listen, nigger. You stay out of our barn. 'Cause my pap, he'll kill you quick as he would a bug. - Now Tater, I don't want to get y'all in trouble. If you don't let me see in here, I'm gonna have to tell Ms. Chism that you done sold off all her material. (door thudding) - Oh! (bag thudding) Uh! - Baby girl, what are you doin'? - They tried to- - Baby girl, I'm not hurt. - You lay a hand on me. It's none of your business what we've done with them posts. - [Lena] Come on, Papa. - Okay, get in the wagon. - And you can tell old lady Chism where she can put her barbed wire. (Ben sighing) - I'm sorry. Come on. (wagon rattling) - Just wait till I tell Pap. Ain't none of ya gonna get away with that. (dramatic music) (knuckles rapping) - So. (door slamming) You decided to stroll on over three hours late, huh? - No, we stopped by the Haney's place, Ms. Chism. He done sold off your wire and posts, ma'am, and uh. - And what? - Well, Lena's got somethin' she wants to tell ya. - I took your books. Book. Two, one at a time. I ruined this one, but I'll pay for it. - Great balls of fire. Ben, if you don't give her the thrashing she deserves, I will. This was the most expensive book in my whole house. And now it's not worth a dime. I knew them bug-eyed no account Haneys stole my wire and posts. I already ordered new ones and put 'em in the barn. But I never thought any child of Ben Sills would be stealing from me, especially the way I've been treatin' her. Eatin' at my table, ridin' in my car and all. - We're both sorry about what happened, Ms. Chism. Lena was wrong to take the book, even though it was just stacked away in the attic. And we're both willin' to work off the price you would've got if you would've sold 'em. - I'll think about it. While you're here you can polish the silver. And Ben, I want you to come in and see what you can do. My piano rolls keep jammin' up. (upbeat piano music) - You wanna dance a minute? Do-do-do-do-do-do. (upbeat piano music) Ooh! - [Mary Tom] Well, do we have a deal? - [Ben] Well, I couldn't say no to that, could I? We have ourselves a deal and I thank you kindly. When do you want me to be ready? - Oh, you be ready Sunday. Right after church. Good a time as any to start off. Oh, from now on, Claudie is gonna have to help me. Can't have nobody I can't trust in my house. - Yes, ma'am. - [Lena] Be ready for what Sunday, Papa? - You addin' eavesdropping to your list of crimes? - Well, I'd rather keep it a surprise, but I guess I'll tell you now so you can look forward. Ms. Chism is gonna let you read her books, and special even give 'em all to ya after awhile. - What happened? What did you say to her? - Well, I told her how much books mean to ya, how hard you try in school. I even told her about the contest. Gradually she mellowed up. - Papa, I can't believe it. Mr. Cook's Voyages. - Yup. - Dickens, Mr. Alger and Fanny Fern! Papa, I'm sorry for all the trouble you took and I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused. - I'm glad you're glad. - You really think she'll give them to me? - Mmm-hmm, I really do. Except it's gonna take a little while to get used to the idea, but she said she'd let me know. - When, Papa? - When I get back from Hawk Hill. - You said you weren't goin'. - Well, I changed my mind. - You mean she said you had to. - No, in fact she said I didn't have to. But we both wanted something from each other, so we struck a bargain. Don't worry, you'll be all right. I'll just be gone a few days. Just gonna be over yonder back of Madison Hill near the river. I'm sure gonna miss you, though. All of you. - I wish you hadn't promised just to get the books, Papa. I'm scared. - Well, I think books are worth being scared for. I stay scared watching you grow up with that good mind, all hungry for learnin', nothin' to feed it with. I want you to do things and know things. Use your talent, pull yourself out. I want you to believe that you can do anything. The world is full of wonders and miracles, Lena. And I wanted those books for a beginnin'. I'll go further than Hawk Hill for that. I'd go around the world. (wagon rattling) - Papa, there's Mr. Haney. - [Ben] Yeah, I saw him. - You got a gun, Papa? - I got somethin' better. The shield and buckler of the Lord. And do you, so don't you forget it, ya hear? - Why don't he leave us alone? - [Ben] He's leaving us alone. - But he's not, he's watchin' us. He scares me. (wagon rattling) (Claudie humming) - Check the ham and the turkey. Make sure all the lazy susans are filled. Then go in the dining room and check the table and be sure it's laid out properly. - I already checked the table three times, Ms. Chism. - Well, you just spend your time doin' as I tell ya. I'll worry about any countin' that needs to be done. ♪ And his vine ♪ ♪ His vine to meddle on ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ (congregation murmuring) - Mighty fine words there, Augustus. Wouldn't be the same town without you. - Thank you. (chuckling) Oh, your wife's not sick, is she brother Sills? We missed her singin'. - Oh, she's over to Ms. Chism's today, helpin' out with the dinner she's havin'. - You're a fine, quiet young fella. I noticed I put you to sleep. (chuckling) What's so funny? - Got any more books from Ms. Chism? - No, it's poetry. - I have a poetry book you oughta read. It's Shakespeare and a few other fellas. Want me to bring it? You can keep it till you memorized all the good ones. You sure are a good memorizer. - So are you. - [Augustus] Well, he'd take me to church with him every Sunday. (church bells chiming) - Well, I'm goin' upstairs and get dressed. My guests should be here in a little while. (wagon rattling) - Hey baby. Mmm. Yes. Now no need for you to go worryin' now. I should be back in no more than a couple of days. Maybe sooner. - Some extra food. Ms. Chism asked me to give it to ya. - Now, Ben, I want you to be careful. Nothing to worry about, but just to keep an eye out for that old coot of a neighbor. Still smartin' over that boundary dispute I won when I took him to court. Did you give him that sack? Well, don't be much longer. My guests will be here shortly. (kiss smacking) - All right now, you take care of everything, ya hear? (Ben chuckling) Even though Roy is expectin' to be the head of the family. You take care. - [Claudie] Okay. Bye bye. - [Ms. Chism] Claudie, you best be makin' that truffle again. (solemn music) (wagon rattling) (solemn music) (horse hooves clomping) Claudie? - Yes, Ms. Chism? - I don't know about Jay Bird, but I'm as hungry as a bear. You can start servin' the dinner now. - You always were a good cook, Mary Tom. - Don't start that again, JB. - Well, I'm not. I'm just sayin' you're a good cook, which you are. I've been thinkin' about expandin' my business. - That so? - I've been thinkin' about it. - Not Mr. Gooch Chism's sister, not the banker and his wife, not Mr. Starnes and his wife. Not one of Ms. Chism's children. Just Mr. Jay Bird Kelsey. Just one person and all them tables of food. Reverend Bell and his wife showed up when the dinner was over. Ms. Chism told them to leave. Oh, I felt so sorry for that crazy, stupid old woman. I didn't know what to do. - Can I go borrow a book from Ms. Chism? - You mean go and try to cheer her up? It won't do no good. - I could go over and pump the piano and play her piano rolls. - All right. Don't be surprised if she turn you down. (suspenseful music) (wagon rattling) - Ms. Chism, can I let Lulu in? She's waitin'. (bell ringing) (door clicking) - Well? - I just happened to come by and I thought I might get a book. - Leave. Leave. Leave. - But Ms. Chism- - A book. Can't you even wait until that daddy of yours keeps his promise and mends that fence? You can back out on me like everybody else does. And there where'd I be? Out another book, no fences mended. - My daddy don't back out on his promises. But I can wait for the book. I really just came by to, I'm sorry about your dinner, Ms. Chism. - Well, for your information, and contrary to gossip Claudie's spreadin', I had a very satisfying dinner. Me and Mr. Kelsey feasted in real high style. You don't believe me? - I believe you, Ms. Chism. - You'd better. Big, noisy dinner parties are a pain. 30, 40 people. Hell, who wants to go to that kind of trouble? And they gobble it all up and leave. Even Kelsey, that old goat, hasn't eaten this good in years. (plate clattering) His wife probably couldn't even boil water. Damn if he thinks I invited him because he was a friend, he got another thing comin'. I owed him because of that bird. And then he had to go and get me this thing. And now I still owe him. I can't stand bein' embolden to anybody! - Sure is pretty though. - Hell, Gooch used to grow ferns 10 times this big. Yeah, you can do everything better, couldn't you, Gooch? Practically ran the whole town. People couldn't do enough for you. Your friends couldn't do enough. Your kids. I couldn't do enough. Oh Gooch, if you were still here, they sure as hell wouldn't ignore me like I was dirt. But you're not here! (plant thudding) (Mary Tom crying) Well stop gawkin'! Get home before I throw somethin' at you! - I hate to leave you when you seem so- - Like, hell you do. You hate to leave me without a bunch of them leftovers I got. You think you can fool me? Well, I got a surprise for you, Miss Greedy Gut. I'm not givin' you a single handout, uh-uh. No, I'm eating 'em all. Every bite. If it takes me a month. (plates shattering) Damn it, out of my way! (dog barking) Oh, Lulu, mama didn't mean to step on ya. I couldn't see. You love me. You can tell your mama I can clean everything up myself. - [Lena] I'm gonna be late for school. - Lena. (chickens clucking) Here. Go. Get that door for me, Roy. (chickens clucking) (knuckles rapping) (water gurgling) (crow squawking) (horse whinnying) (birds chirping) (tools clanging) - [Lena] Found any good poetry books at home yet? - Listen, Alma. I can't lend ya any books. - Why? - My father said I couldn't. - [Lena] Oh. - I'm not even supposed to talk to you. - Why? - I don't know. I think Mr. Doens talked to my father about somethin'. My father says if y'all keep up the country out here, you'll have to go to your own schools. - Why? - I don't know. Because you don't need the same things we do, I guess. Father says you first ones, you're like a wedge, and the more that comes, the more trouble they'll be. And it'd be better if it all stopped right now. (dramatic music) (horse whinnying) (knuckles rapping) - [Lena] Come on, open the door, open the door! - Mama's gone lookin' for the cow. She said I left the gate open, but I didn't. She said keep the door locked. When is Papa comin' back? - Tomorrow for sure. We better eat before Claudie comes back. You set the table. (dramatic music) - [Roy] Is that a man? - Just hush, come stand by me. - [Henry] Hey, girl! I know you're in there! - Who's that? - It's probably just somebody who found the cow. (door slamming) - You better get your daddy. - You better stay back, Mr. Haney. - Your daddy's gonna pay for this. She's, she's taken my horse. That old woman. She gets whatever she wants. And that's my horse. Sambo Sills! You come out here and settle with me! (gun firing) - Who's that? - You gonna disgrace your husband like this? - You already done that yourself. (knuckles rapping) - It's me, Claudie! What was that? - It was Mr. Haney. He was drunk. Ms. Haney took him off. - What did he want? - He wanted to see Papa. He was mad about somethin'. I think Ms. Chism has taken his horse for the debt he owes her, and he says Papa's to blame. - That trash. That good for nothin' trash. Now he know your daddy's not home! I got a surprise for y'all. Sit down, sit down. I was savin' it for when your daddy come home, but tonight a good a time as any. - Would you look at that. - I want you to stay away from them Haneys, especially Tater. He the one that gotta prove his self. - Of what? - Whatever he got to prove. How big, how much better, how much of a man. When I was little, these men, white hats we called 'em, they'd come ridin' down through the flats where we lived lookin' for somebody they wanted. They used to do that. They'd come down, call a colored man out on his porch at night, and just take him off. One time nobody came out, so the white men started burnin' houses. My family ran down to the river bottom, and in the mornin' when we came back just before dawn our house was burnt down with everything in it. - But that was the South. It's different here. - Lena, it's like a blight. One day it's not some place, and then it is. And you know it's gonna keep on spreadin' until they kill off what was growin' so good. - [Lena] Papa says that won't happen here in Bethel Springs. - After the contest at school, your daddy said he's afraid you didn't know how much he loved you 'cause he always so busy. He never spend much time with you to tell ya things. He say he gonna try to do better. You sure stretched the day out, didn't ya? We all better get to bed. Papa be home tomorrow for sure. (soft pensive music) (roosters crowing) (wagon rattling) Boy, have you gone crazy trackin' mud in this house? (soft pensive music) (bird squawking) (soft pensive music) (dog barking) (water gurgling) (crow squawking) (soft pensive music) Come on now. Come on in here. Come in here. (soft pensive music) Oh, Lord, wherever my Ben and Lena are, be good to 'em. (soft dramatic music) (horse whinnying) - Papa! Papa, it's me, Lena! (horse whinnying) (dramatic music) Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa, I found you. - I knew help was gonna come somehow. But to be you, Lena, how wonderful. (Tater moaning) - Papa, what happened? - Tater's horse bolted. His foot got caught in the stirrup. Horse dragged him down from the windmill. I think his leg is broken. His head's banged up. He's been out since, what day is it? - Tuesday. Papa, what did he do to you? - He rode up to the fence on his daddy's horse and fired a shot that scared everybody. Him, me. The horse shot out like a hornet. Dragged him all through that brush. - Come on, Papa. I gotta get you into the wagon. - No, you better get Tater in there first. - Papa, he tried to kill you. I can't. I can't touch him. We'll send somebody for him. - The Good Lord already done send somebody. Oh, Lena, I hope I'm not dreamin' you. - No, Papa, I'm really here. (horse whinnying) (Tater moaning) - Oh, baby girl. I can't be fixed up none. - Yes, you can. - No I can't. But Tater can. So I want you to get him back to his folks. - No, I won't. - For my sake, baby girl. No reason for you to grieve. This is wonderful. And we get to say last things to each other. Most folks don't get to or can't. It's what I held on for, baby girl. So I could tell you how much I love you and Claudie and Roy. And to thank you for all you've given me. (Ben and Lena crying) Now. - Why wasn't it Tater instead of you? Where was the shield and buckler of the Lord? - Oh, I don't know, Lena. I've been wrestling with that all night, and you gonna have to wrestle with it, too, till you find the answer. - Papa, I don't wanna live if you can't! - I know, honey. It feels that way at first but, but if you live then I live, too, right there with you. (Ben grunting) Now you bring the wagon close and I'll try to help you get him in. - You in first. I can manage it. I know what to do by myself. Whoa. Stand, Papa. - Oh! His horse is close by. I heard him last night. Find him while I rest a little. - Do I have to leave you, Papa? Yes, it's better to. - [Lena] I can't. - Can't? Remember, after this you can do anything. Now go on. (soft solemn music) - Papa? Papa? Papa. Forgive me. I couldn't say last things. (Lena crying) - God's sake help me. Girl. Help me. Somebody. - I can't. Papa. Why wouldn't you give up on him? Why couldn't you so I could to? (crow squawking) (soft music) (Tater grunting) - No. No. (Tater yelping) - [Lena] Don't you pass out on me. (suspenseful music) - Uh! Uh! (Tater groaning) (soft piano music) (owl hooting) (soft solemn music) (wagon rattling) (dog barking) - Name of God. Here. (Tater moaning) Come on, son. (Tater moaning) Come on, son, that's it. Come on, son, that's it. Now wait a minute, wait a minute. Lord, let's turn your leg around just a little bit. That's it, that's it, son. Okay. Here we go, son. You're gonna be all right. (Tater whimpering) You're gonna be all right. You're gonna be all right. You're gonna be all right. (Tater moaning) (horse whinnying) (Tater moaning) (wagon rattling) - Ben! Ah! Gah! Ah! Ah! God! Ah! (Claudie wailing) Ben! Oh God. (Claudie wailing) Ben! Oh God! No! (coyote howling) (Claudie wailing) Tell me how it happened. - I just found him and all killed. - Well, somebody did this. And if it takes me the rest of my life, they're gonna pay for it. Tell me who it was, Lena. You have to tell me. - I can't remember. - You can't remember? You're the best memorizer in school! You know the Bible through. What do you mean you can't remember? I can guess who it was. - You don't know who it was. You won't ever know. - How, child? How in God's name can you let the person that did this to your daddy go free? - Papa didn't talk about any of that. He just talked about lovin' us and how we shouldn't give up on that person. And I didn't. I won't. - Oh. Oh, little girl. Little girl. You gonna be just like him. Oh, Lord have mercy. (Claudie crying) (engine rumbling) - So, Ben's back. I told you not to worry. Damn! Damn! Starnes and Reverend Bell need to know. Give her a crank. (engine rumbling) (horse nickers) (chickens clucking) - Come on, let's go. - Are you all right? - Yes. Before Mr. Starnes comes, do you wanna say goodbye? - I already did. - Sleep as long as you can. (wagon rattling) (Augustus clearing throat) - Miss Lena. - Lena, what can I say? You know all the words already. (chickens clucking) - [Lena] What's Winslow Starnes doing here? - Mary Tom brought him out. He flagged her down as she was passin' him on his way to school. He'd heard from his father what happened and wanted to come out. - Does his father know he's here? - Not yet, but, uh, he will in just a minute. (wagon rattling) - With Ben gone, I need a new hand. I don't mean that there can be as good a hand as Ben. Dammit. But you people always have a brother or a cousin or an uncle. Don't you have anybody back there that could make me a good hand? - Sister is all. - Well, maybe I can squeeze enough work out of those Haneys to get the crop in and get me a new hand by spring. - I thought the Haneys were movin'. - Movin'? I was throwin' them off, but dammit, I need somebody. They may as well stay now till the last baby's welped and on its way to travel. I hear you don't know anything that happened. Don't you know I can't help you if you won't speak up? You people make me so tired. But then, I probably couldn't help anyway. That shoddy old coot I had the boundary dispute with, if he sent somebody over to scare off my man, he's already plenty sure I can't prove it. So. What are you gonna do, hmm? Well? What are you gonna do? Rent's paid up till the first of the year. - Claudie, we could go back to Scatter Creek if you want. I'll go. - This is where your daddy brought you to have a chance, and this is where we're gonna stay. Right here. I can wash and iron and work any job. So can Lena. We know how to earn our keep. And we know how to knuckle to ya. Only we intend to work and knuckle the way we choose to. And where we choose to. I got a son comin' up. Be a same threat to all of y'all the way Ben was. I hope you ready for him, 'cause I'm gonna have him ready for you. - [Augustus] Amen. - Boy, get yourself over here this minute. Just what in the juice are you doing here? If you don't get yourself right back to school, you'll feel my belt across your backside right here and now. - I'm gonna stay here in case there's anything I can do. - What? - Right now we're gonna go for a walk. We have things to talk about. - Winslow. Winslow, get back here! - I'll stop by the school and tell Mr. Doens. Let the boy be, Randolph. - All I'm gettin' is one broken down plow for all of this. I'll go bankrupt dealin' with these people. - Ben kept a good plow and worth two of your funerals and you know it. Hell, it covers everything, Starnes. Everything. Everything. Everything! Get out of my way, dammit! - Till tomorrow, Miss Lena. Services will be at the cemetery at 11. I'll pray. (engine rumbling) (soft piano music) - [Ben] There's no reason to grieve. This is wonderful, that we have last things to say to each other. - [Augustus] Shall be changed and made like unto his own glorious body according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself. - [Claudie] After the contest at school, your daddy said he's afraid you didn't know how much he loved ya, 'cause he's always so busy. (soft piano music) - [Ben] I want you to do things and know things. Use your talent, pull yourself out. I want you to believe you can do anything. The world is full of wonders and miracles, Lena. (gentle music) - Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Who's that in our cotton? (gentle music) Come on, come on. (wagon rattling) (gentle music)
