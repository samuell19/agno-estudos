Curtis, do you mind giving us a moment? I'll be on the porch. Well, you must be Curtis. It's just a month, Wendy. It's just-- Gran and I already had plans, just the two of us. Look, I know how much you love Gran, okay? We all do. But you need to start spending time with some other kids. It's actually what sparked your mother's great idea about giving the kids at the orphanage some family time. You know, a much-needed Christmas break they might not otherwise get. And she thought that it'd be good for you if we hosted Curtis. - But I-- - The holiday season can be tough. Especially if you have no one to share it with. Not everyone has a family like you. I know, it's just-- I don't wanna babysit over Christmas break. Curtis is only a few years younger than you, Wendy. He doesn't need a babysitter. He might just need a big sister. l mean, what are we supposed to talk about? Baseball? Bugs? And what about Gran? We have a routine. Okay. Well, I spoke with Gran, and she said Curtis is more than welcome to hang out with you guys this weekend. She hasn't thought about how this complicates things. I want you on your best behavior, okay? And treat Curtis like family. You guys just need to find some common ground, that's all. Okay. All right, let's get going before Gran gets mad. Come on. - Hey. Ooh! - Ah! - Hey. - Come on. That way. - Hey, okay! - Ooh! Hey you did make sure everything was tied down good and tight, though? - Yeah, I tied it down. - Sweet. - Okay. - Tight. Shit! Dang, man! Ah, Barney! Stop! Stop! Get out the car. Clyde! I thought you said everything was secure! Uh, it was! It was. It was. It was at first. You do realize that the boss will kill us if we lose any of this stuff, all right? No, man, it wasn't even my fault, Barney! Man, you had to hit every pothole on the road, man! - You could've dodged that! - What did-- I just-- Just help me get it back in the truck, okay? - Okay, man, okay! - Okay? - Sorry, okay. - Okay. Ohh! No! God, get the barrel out the water! Um, I just got these new boots today, Barney. I-I don't think I wanna do that, man. Get the barrel out the water! Okay, you don't gotta yell at me. Relax. Is all that blue stuff supposed to be pouring out that barrel like that? I don't think so. What we gonna do, man? - We? - Yeah. But there's no "I" in "spilt". Ah. - Yes, there is. - I know. - Yes, there is. - I know. - I got it. - Okay. What if we let all that stuff in the barrel spill in the lake, and we take it back up when it's lighter? - Yeah, man, I like that idea. - I know. That's smart, that's smart. Real good idea. - Yep. - Um... - What we gonna tell boss? - I'mma tell 'em you did it. - What? - Mm-hmm. All right, we'll see you in a few days. The three of you have fun, and try to stay out of trouble, all right? We're gonna have a great time. I can't guarantee we won't find trouble though. All right. Don't worry. You're gonna be good friends in no time. I hope so. "A baby velociraptor's skull isn't fully developed until... - they're six--" - Hey, Curtis. Why don't you join us? We're looking over our latest research. I'm sure he's fine. You'd probably just find this boring, anyway. Yeah, I'm good. I'm just glad to be out of the orphanage for a little while. Well, who's hungry? I know I am. I think I'll start dinner. Would you like some help? That'd be really nice, Curtis. Hey, Curtis? Gran and I might not be here tomorrow morning when you wake up. We have to go visit a relative. But I thought we were staying here for the weekend? You are. What am I supposed to do? We'll only be gone for part of the day. Don't worry about things that don't concern you. And don't bother my Gran about any of this. She already has a lot to take in, you know? Inviting a stranger into her home and everything. It's for your own safety. How about tacos? My favorite. We're coming! What are you doing here? I thought you said you were visiting relatives? You can't be here! - Wendy, it's okay. - But, Gran, it-- I think we can trust him. How do you know? Let's just say I have a feeling. Who would believe him, anyway? We can trust you, can't we? Yeah. You're not just saying that, are you? You gotta mean it. No-- I mean, yes! Yes, you can trust me. Lives depend on that trust. Yes, ma'am. You must promise us. Promise them that whatever you see here today must be kept secret. Do you understand? Yes, I promise! Wait, did you say "them"? Whoa! Very funny. No wonder you don't have any friends. I didn't ask for you to come. He's here now, Wendy. And you, as long as you are with us, you are part of this family. No more bickering. Sorry, Gran. - Is that a real... - Dinosaur? He used to roam these woods. He died of old age about 20 years ago. That's impossible! Dinosaurs went extinct millions of years ago. And if they were in these woods, someone would've seen them. This thing is huge. It's not a thing. His name was Caesar. This is crazy. I'm going back to the house and calling the orphanage. What was that? This is Junior. He's amazing! H-how is this even possible? We're not sure why or how, but the morning after every full moon, in this spot, a doorway opens up for one day. We're not sure if it's a parallel world or if it's our past, but we know we have to keep it a secret. And now, Curtis, you are one of the very few who know about this. Hey, Junior, I brought you a soccer ball. Whoa! He's strong for a little guy. I got it! Run! Run! Run! No, no, no. Shh. Stay calm. He is gonna eat me? No. He likes you. He can tell. You're a good person. That's Albert, and this is Mina. Hello? Oh, Albert, Chris isn't coming. Remember, he said his goodbyes the last time he was here? His parents took a job far away and they had to move, but he's doing great. And he checks in with me from time to time and makes sure that you are safe and happy. He loves you. Your friendship is everything to him. He was so happy that he got to see Junior before he had to go. Mm-hmm. Ha! Oh! It's time for us to go. It's a long hike back. Albert, I will see you in a month. You and your family be safe. Sorry, Junior. Next time. So what is your research about? What we showed you today. I'm working on my newest book. It's called The Secret Lives of Dinosaurs . And Wendy's been helping me with it. And if it's okay with her, I'd like you to join us. There's room on the cover for one more name. Yeah, that's fine. All right, tell me what to do. First off, mom and dad don't know anything about this. A book about dinosaurs, yes, but real-life dinosaurs? No. Got it. I won't tell anyone. How did you find them? One evening, I was out for a walk in the woods, and a mysterious man appeared out of the fog. - Were you scared? - Yes! At first, but there was something about him. A peace, a kindness surrounded him. And he told me that it was time to pass the secrets of the forest to someone with virtue. And just as I felt the goodness in him, he sensed in me a gentleness, and trust, and love. And those are the qualities that I try to give to my daughter and to my granddaughter. He showed me the wonders that we shared with you today. And he also gave me something that he said might come in handy. What was that? That's a secret for another time. All right, you two, off to bed. - Good night, Gran. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night, Curtis. Good morning, Gran. Well, good morning, you two. - Curtis, did you sleep all right? - Well, I finally could. I can't wait till the next full moon to see 'em again. Well, you won't have to wait that long. Come on out, little one. Junior? Wait-- But how did he...? Who knows? He must've followed us home. He's trapped here. Oh, his parents must be worried. Well, it's my job to make sure that he's safe until the next full moon. And you two can help me while you're here. And after that we'll lay low, and... Curtis and l can help out after school. Perfect. Ohh. Bye, kids! Bye! - Bye, Tadrina. Thank you. - Bye, Mason. You are welcome. Ow! H-Help... 911, what's your emergency? Junior? Wait-- Where'd you go? Junior... Junior? Junior? Mom? - Mom. - Gran. Mom, hey. Who-- Who is Junior? I don't-- I don't know. What happened to Gran? She took a pretty nasty fall but she's gonna be all right. The doctor said that she's gonna take some time to heal, so she's staying with us for a little while, okay? Um... - It's Christmas break. - Yeah. Curtis and I could take care of Gran at her house. I think it's easiest for everyone if she just stays here with us. - But, Dad-- - Wendy. - Junior! - Gran! Mom. Mom, you keep calling out for-- for Junior. Who-- who's Junior? No-- no one. I, uh-- Oh, I really think I hit my head that hard. And... ooh, and my leg. - Ooh... - See, Mom, this is exactly why we don't think you should be staying out there all alone. Olivia, I'm not that far out of town. I'm gonna be fine. And as soon as I go home, these two kids, they'll help. Okay, Mom. Maybe give me-- give me a minute with them. All right, let's go. You can have one minute. One minute, okay? What happened to Junior? He must've gotten scared when I fell and he ran out the front door. But he's gotta be around my house somewhere, don't you think? You need to go find him 'cause he's just too little to be out there all by himself. Don't worry, Gran, we'll find him. We'll find him. - Come on, Curtis. Come on. - Okay. Junior! Junior! Junior! Come on, buddy! Look, I found something. Ugh, he could be anywhere. I think it's time I show you the other secret Gran was talking about. It's not a flying robot? Or freaky clown, is it? Wendy, answer me! Come on, Curtis. Junior! - Junior! - Junior! Come here, buddy, it's Wendy! Junior! This will take forever. The forest is massive, he could be anywhere. Why don't we use the rockets for extra speed? I bet we could find him in no time. No, we would shoot past so fast, everything would be a blur. We'd never be able to find him that way, trust me. Well, Gran did make one modification we could use to help find Junior. I just don't have that much experience with it. Let's do it! Okay, hold on. It's... Ah. Oh, you might wanna put up your glasses. Uh, Wendy? - Wendy, there's a truck. - Hold on. - Wendy, there's a truck! - Hold on. Wendy, hurry up! We're-- - We're not gonna make it! - We're gonna make it! - No, we're not, Wendy. There's a truck! Hurry up! - Hold on! - There's a truck! - Hope you're not afraid of heights! What!? You can open your eyes now. Bet none of the other kids are getting to do this with their host families. - Um... - Can you keep it steady? I thought you said you could drive? Drive yes, flying... not so much. Gran took me up once before. She said I was a natural. Natural disaster maybe. Hey, you're not dead. Have a little faith. Everything will turn out in the end the way it's meant to be. You're right. I'm sorry, Wendy. This is amazing. - What does this button do? - No! Don't-- - Whoa! Whoa! - Oh, you've killed us! We're gonna die! Oh, you-- Oh, you've killed us, you fool! Oh, it's all your fault, we'll die! Oh, we're gonna die! It's all your fault! Wait, why are you laughing? That one's not connected to anything. - What? - But seriously, don't touch anything. You flip the wrong switch and it could be bad. Like, really bad, like... ...bad. - Um, but, Curtis? - Yeah? I do owe you an apology. For what, scaring me? No, that too, but... I realized when you first arrived, I might've been a little... mean? It's okay. It's just, ever since I was a little girl, I heard all the stories of the amazing adventures with my mom and Gran. Every summer, they would travel the world looking for ancient artifacts and treasures. It was something they shared, just the two of them. I don't know, I just kinda thought that the dinosaurs and the doorway was... It was yours. I get it. But you came along and Gran just kind of... let you in. Without asking me. Well, anyways, I'm sorry. You're lucky to have someone. Especially family. I would do anything to talk to my parents or grandparents, just once. You hear that? No, I don't hear anything. Hey, I think I see Junior. - What? - Hold on. Junior! Junior! Junior! Junior! Junior! It's okay! It's okay! Gran's okay! She's been worried about you. We both have been. Let's get you home safe. Did you find him? Oh! Junior! You're so good. I'm so glad you're back! Down, down, down! I thought I heard you guys come in. - Mmm, what's going on? - Uh... Ah, my leg's acting up a little bit. A little bit? What the-- Ju, Ju, Ju-- - Oh, my gosh, what is that? - Guys, get back! - Get back behind me! - Mason he's not gonna hurt anyone! How do you know that? Because I know his parents. And they're gentle, so is he. What exactly is he, Gran? A dinosaur. Okay, Mom. Oh, my gosh. We're gonna have to call the doctor. Liv, I am fine! This is Junior. But, Mom... Liv, when have I ever not told you the truth about anything? - Never? - All right, then, so here's the truth now. There's a secret doorway that opens after every full moon between here and the land of dinosaurs. I'm the guardian of that doorway. And Junior is trapped here until the next full moon. I've been looking after him for over three weeks. The next full moon is in two days, and then he can go home. Tadrina, this is just crazy. But he is kinda cute. Okay, look. Junior can stay here tonight. But, tomorrow, we're going to decide what to do with him. All right, now, everybody, let's let Gran rest, okay? Come on. Slowly. Get some rest, Gran. Hey. I know this is difficult, seeing your mother like this. And she is always welcome to stay with us. But that creature, it can't stay here. We don't know what it is. And as deputy mayor, it's literally my duty to make sure that the citizens of this community, and my family, are safe. Tomorrow, I'm gonna speak with the mayor, and see if there's any suitable place to house Junior. Maybe the zoo will take him. You-- you can't! If they find out he's a real dinosaur, there's no telling what they'll do to him. Or the others in the forest! It's being taken care of. - Please, we'll help take care of him. - He's Gran's responsibility. And everyone is my responsibility. - But, Dad, it's not fair. - That's my final word. Let's get washed up, okay. It's almost time for dinner. A living dinosaur is impossible. Well, I still believe in the impossible. I remember when you did too. Why am I the bad guy? I'm just trying to make sure everybody is safe! - Good morning! - Morning, guys! Hey, we both have to go to work today, okay? So it's gonna be up to you guys to make sure that Gran has everything she needs, okay? Yeah, we'll take care of Junior too. You'll see he'll be no problem. Wendy, darling, Junior needs to be with his own kind. - Whatever that is. - Yeah. - That's what I'm trying to do. - Okay. Well, I'm sure Mr. Patterson will find a place that you can visit Junior. - Problem solved. - Yeah. Dad, he has a family. Wendy, now's not the time. We gotta get to work, okay? Gotta go, guys. Call us if something comes up, okay? We'll be back later. You stay out of trouble, all right? - We will. - All right, thank you. Well, good morning, my little adventurers. - Good morning, Gran. - Morning, Mrs. Green. Hey, what did I tell you? Call me Gran. Dad says Junior can't stay with us. Oh, your dad. You know he's trying to do what's best for everyone. But he has forgotten what it's like to be a kid. That young man is still in there. You'll see. I hope you're right. Oh! Oh! - Aw! - Corn flakes! I forgot to tell you. I've been teaching Junior a few words while he's been staying at my house. He's making great progress. He'll be speaking in complete sentences in no time. Won't you, my little dino genius? Genius. Mason, Olivia! How's your mother? Ugh, she gave us quite the scare, um, but she's gonna be all right. Good to hear. My heart goes out to you and your family. I really appreciate that, Samuel, thank you. Well, thank goodness you're here today. I don't know if you noticed, but several people are out of the office sick. I've had reports from all over the city that people have come down with some kind of a sleeping sickness. Do we have any idea what could be causing it? Well, a tsetse fly is the first thing that comes to my mind. Well, I learned about them when I traveled to Africa with my mother when I was younger. Their bite causes flu-like symptoms and sleeping issues. But I don't know, that doesn't really makes sense. They're not common here. I know it sounds crazy, but that's exactly what our experts think it might be. For now, let's just hope it's an isolated thing. If there's anything that we can do, you just let us know. Well, let's not get the public stirred up until more research can be done. Tests are being conducted to confirm if it's the tsetse fly. So, for now, all we can do is wait. The first batch is almost complete. It will be more than enough to cover this whole area. - Hey! - Hi! We only have time to grab a quick lunch, then we gotta head back to the office. - Have you eaten? - Yeah. Good. Curtis and I have been taking good care of Gran and Junior. Good. I'm really glad to hear that you guys are getting along. He's not so bad. See? What did the mayor say about Junior? Uh, well, actually, we didn't get a chance to talk to him about that. We're dealing with some other pressing issues right now. Like what? Nothing to worry yourself about. You just enjoy your time with Junior while you can, okay? Okay. Careful with those. See? I told you Wendy and Curtis would hit it off. Hey, Junior, say "Curtis." Cur... Cur-tis. Cur... - Cur... - Cur... ...-tis. It's not working. Wendy! - Curtis. - Oh! Thank you. Sure you don't want one, Gran? No, I'm good. But if you two are good with watching Junior, I think I need a nap. We'll watch him, Gran. Good. You wanna gimme a hand? - Here, Gran. - All right. Here we go. Careful on the step. Hey! Hey, Junior! Now roll it back to me. Hmm. Go deep, Junior! Oh, no! Junior? Junior! Ju-- Curtis, are you all right? The tree. It talks. Really? They communicate through the roots. They said that there's something wrong with the river. Something we, the humans, can't tell by drinking it, but the trees can sense it. There's something toxic in the water. Okay, so the tree that's been in my yard my entire life, suddenly told you the water was unsafe? Now you act like a talking tree is crazy. You've witnessed a door to the land before time, seen real-life dinosaurs, and have flown a homemade rocket of death. Water bad. Wait, wait, so, so-- so Junior's stuck here for a month, Dad wants him gone, Gran's hurt, and-and now the water is toxic? What else could go wrong? We save town. Together. All right. Who's up for another ride on the rocket of death? There! That building! I saw that building in my head. - Come on, Junior. - Yeah. Hey, man, uh, that looks pretty heavy. - Ah! It's not that bad. - You doin' good, though. - Appreciate it. - Why you got it on the side? Uh, well, you know, the way it was lifted and science. - Makes sense. - Makes sense. Let me just... All right. - Right there. - Sweet! - Good job, man. - All right. - That's lunch, everybody! - Peace out. Disperse. Uh, except you, li'l mama. Come here. Here. I want a bacon, egg with cheese with a large fry. - No. - What-- What's wrong with her? Attitude. Hey. Who's this? - Who's that? - It's boss. Hello? Ah. Hey, boss! Yeah, it's Barney. Oh, yeah, we just finished processing all of it, yeah. All the barrels are ready to be shipped off. - Tell him I said hi. - Uh-- Yeah, l just let everyone leave for lunch. Yeah. Uh... I-I'm not really sure what happened, um, some of it just, you know, kinda leaked in the river and, uh, it just kinda got there. I mean we, we, we, we cleaned up what we could. Yeah. Oh, no, no, there'll be more than enough, I promise, yeah. Tell him, tell him, tell him Clyde took care of everything. - Tell him Clyde did everything! - Clyde, Clyde, call-- - Tell him. You almost messed it up! - Clyde-- No, no, yeah, boss, I'm still here. Yeah. I-- Yeah, I promise. No more mess ups. Okay, Warren Chapel? Yeah, we'll be there. We'll be there soon. No worries. - All right. All right, bye, boss. Bye. - Tell him-- Yo, I hate it when you talk to me when I'm on the phone. - It's very rude! - I'm so sorry-- Hey! Come here. Come here. What are you doing? - I was just looking for my dog. - What'd you hear? - Nothing? - What'd you see? - Uh... - Uh, uh... Enough! Gimme those glasses! Get 'em again! Go one more time! Boom! Barney! Barney, Barney! It's okay! Barney! - Hey! It's okay-- - Hey! Hey! H-hey! My dad is the deputy mayor and y'all can get in big trouble for that. You're going to jail. - My dad's deputy mayor... - You gonna go to jail. - Ooh! - Ooh! - We ain't scared of none of that! - None! What is it? Hey, uh, what kinda dog you say you lookin' for again? Whoa, what is that? - Get it! - Come here, come here. Stay back. Stay back. Control your mutt. Control it! If I pour this down his ear, it'll turn his brain to soup. - What? - Yeah, you heard me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Is that how that stuff actually works? I don't know, man. Why? Well, because I chugged three of 'em! - Three? - Yeah, I was thirsty! Thirsty? You see that? You'll be so brain-damaged, you gonna be just like Barney. - No! - Mm-hmm. Control him! No! Junior, No! No, no, no! - Get 'em, Barney! - Back! Back up! Watch this! Git! I got him! - Come on, let's go! Let's go! - Git! Git! I'm gonna swing kick him, I'm coming! - Let's go! Get in here! - I'm going! - Hurry up! - I'm sorry! - Go! - I'm going! - Go! - I'm going! - Are you here? - I'm here! I'm driving! I'm dead. I'm dead. Dad's gonna kill me. Come on, Junior. We're gonna get him. Come on. What did they say it was called? Chapel Hill? Warren Chapel. - Thank you, Junior. - No problem. Save Curtis. It's an airport. Let's go. - Stay here, Junior. - Okay. Yeah, sit tight, kid. Don't move. Yeah, that should do it, Barney. Yeah. Don't worry, kid. It'll all be over soon. Ah! Ow! - You okay? - Why didn't you tie his feet up? I ran out of rope. I have no more rope. - Hey, boss. - Hey, boss. - Show it to me. - Oh! - We did good, huh, boss? - Oh, yeah. It's amazing. Such a small amount can affect such a large area. Think of the money we're gonna make off the black market when our plan proves its effectiveness. - We gonna be rich, boss! - What's up with the kid? Uh, found him snooping around the lab, boss, along with some girl and their ugly dog. - Girl? What girl? - Yeah. - Where is she now? - Oh, she's back at the lab. Oh, but don't worry. Nothin'. - Clean slate. - Nothin'. - Hi, Wendy! - I told you to wait for me. What are you doing? Whoa! Pickles! Settle down. Why Pickles, boss? Well, you know how whenever you bend a pickle, it makes a snap? Yeah? Well, so does my Pickles. She's green, and she snaps! Good one, boss. You had me. You got me. Pickles, settle down! When's the last time you fed her? It's been about a week. Oh. Might be time for fresh meat! Snack time! Boss, what you doin'? Letting Pickles out for her walk. It's snack time! - Wait, right now? - Yeah! - That's you! That's you! - Whoa, whoa, no, you! Hey, you-- Oh, no. - No. - No, no, no. Come on, let's go. Close it. Come on! Come on! Where's Junior? He's in the jeep. Well, we can't just leave him here. I know! When I open this gate, go out the back. - Oh, whoa, whoa! - Oh, no, no, no, no! Why can't we go out the back first? Because Pickles needs bait! Open the gate! Open the gate! Open the gate! Hold it, hold it. Thanks, boss. What now? Get back to the lab and make sure it's secure! Okay! Uh... - Go! - Oh, yeah! Ah-- What about the kids? What if they call the police? I'm the mayor of this town. I control the police. - Big boss. - That's why he's in charge. See you, boss! Quick, come on, come on. You know what's crazy, Barney? What? Boss just tried to use us as bait. All right, look, Clyde, I didn't wanna tell you this, but he was trying to use you as bait. Uh, he used both of us. We were side by side. Yes, he put us both in there, so you wouldn't feel left out and alone. - He like me better. - Hmm. Okay, hmm. We know who's in charge. Yeah. I'm in charge. I'm the one driving. - What was that? - I don't know. - Sounds like some leaves or something. - Hmm. Oh. You right. Yeah, we do got the roof off. - Drop top! - Drop top! Why you silly? - What is that? - It came from the back. - Check and see what that was. - Nah, man, you look. Clyde, I can't look, I'm driving. - Oh, you right. - Yeah. - Uh... Barney? - What? - That-that rat from the lab? - Hmm? He's back, Barney. He's back there sitting in the back seat. Okay. All right. Well, give him some of your karate moves, brother. - Show 'em what you got! - My karate moves? I got 'him! - Give it to him! - I got him! Yeah, give it to him! Yeah! - Did you get him? - I got him! I got him! We got him. We got him! Woo! We got him! You did good, bro. You did your thing. Woo-hoo! Yeah! Oh-- What the... Barney, he's back! He is back, man! Okay, well, do something and take care of it, my brother! - You got it! - I got somethin' for him. Yeah, get him, get him! Yeah! Yeah, get him! - Ow! Ow! Ow! Ah! - Yeah! - What? He bit-- What'd you mean-- - He bit me! He bit me, look. Ooh, that looks like it hurts. You know what, I got something for him. - Okay, what? - I got something for him. Mm-hmm. It's time for Pickles' sleepy-time shot, baby! That's perfect! There's Junior! Uh, Barney, we got a problem. - What? - Those kids is back. Huh? And they're flying a go-kart. Clyde, go-karts don't fly. What are you talking about? Look for yourself, Barney. Whoa! Okay, okay. We can't let them follow us back to the lab. - I got it. I got it. - Okay? Okay! Show 'em what you got. - Oh! - No, no, no! - You get them? - I hit them! I hit them! Yeah! Sorry, Junior. Let me get the rat! - Get the rat! - I shot him again! - You got 'em? - He gone! Oh, I did it! I did it! Oh, yeah, I did it! Woo-hoo! Huh? - We, we did it. - Yeah, that's what I said, brother. We did it, good job! Yeah! Woo! Boss is gonna be so proud of us. Yeah, boss is gonna be proud of me. - Oh, boss is gonna be proud of me. - Us. I said us, did you not hear what I said? I said boss is gonna be proud of us. Calm down. All right, I need you to keep one eye open at all times. - For what? - Why you always got an attitude? Just look for anything out of the ordinary. You okay? No, li'l mama. You wouldn't believe it if I told you. And the last time we saw Junior, he was in the back of their jeep. We didn't know there'd be bad guys there. The tree only said there's something wrong with the water. Well, that is certainly gonna be a new chapter in our book. Absolutely amazing. We found this at the airport hangar. They had barrels of this stuff. Well, tomorrow after your parents go to work, I'm gonna analyze this. And then we will find Junior, and we'll get him home. All of my lab equipment is back at the house. - Oh, we can take you. - Yeah? When did you learn how to drive? Gran... There's one, um... little, tiny thing we forgot to mention, um... we were flying. And how did you manage that? It was hidden in the backyard. Oh, my granddaughter. The risk-taker. Just like her Gran. It was a little cramped, but we made it. At least we didn't almost hit a plane. That would've been bad. Curtis! What? Wendy, test tube? Let's find out what they're up to. Is there anything we can do? This will take a minute. Why don't you have a seat? Can I ask you something? You don't have to answer if you don't want to, it's just... How I became an orphan? - Am I that obvious? - It's okay, I'm used to it. My parents died when I was a baby. They were on their way home, it was late, and it was snowing. The roads got icy and a truck slid into their lane. They couldn't stop. That's horrible, I'm so sorry. It's okay. I was told that my parents were good people. That they were kind to everyone they met. Also, that they loved me very much. That's why I try to be the best person that I can. Any brothers or sisters? No, just me. I learned to look out for myself. But to be perfectly honest, it still gets lonely. I can understand that. My mom actually had a lot of medical problems when I was born. She said I was her miracle baby. Her and my dad talked to a ton of doctors, but they couldn't have children after me. Adoption was the only option. But as they got into work and I got older, I hung out a lot with Gran. Science and adventure is great, but... I never really got along with other kids. We get along fine. I've got it! - What is it? - This. It's from the African tsetse fly. Or a synthetic version. If this gets into the water supply, people will be sleepy for days. - Oh! Oh... Oh! - Oh! - Oh, Gran, oh. Curtis, take this. - Oh, wow, l gotta go lie down. Let's go to your room. Careful. Gran's asleep. You need to tell your parents about all this. Let's find Junior first. Then we can get grounded. Yeah. Like literally. Grounded. Come on, that was good! What's up, man? - Just waiting for the go-ahead. - Good! 'Cause this job has been all sorts of trouble. What kind of trouble, cops? Nah, no police. Just these weird kids snoopin' where they're not supposed to be, but me and Barney, we got 'em good. - Kids, really? - Yes. All right, and they had this little weird-looking monster, pet-looking thing, and it attacked us, man! But, Barney, what did I do? - You know what I did. - I know what you did. I pulled out Pickles' sleepy-time pistol, I lined it up, boom! - Clyde! - Huh? Look, you don't gotta yell! That's how loud it was though, man. Yeah, but you don't gotta scream. My fault. You right. My bad. My bad. So, you shot a little dog with a tranquilizer gun? Yeah, man, all right, look. I shot him in the back of the jeep, he fell off, rolled around. He's probably roadkill by now. Boom. Hey! Let's ride, people! Let's go take care of this business, man. What's wrong with you? Come on. We... we failed him. We failed him. We promised we would keep him safe! We promised we would... Wendy, I... I think we need to call the police. I know, I know. This is bigger than that. Mr. Patterson? Mr. Patterson, this is Wendy Jenkins, my dad works for you, um... Yes, Wendy. I know who you are, slow down. Tell me what's going on. Me and Curtis, we found something big. Some very bad people are doing something. They have this chemical that can put people to sleep. Who's Curtis? The boy who's staying with us for a month. Where are you now? Some type of lab or headquarters? I can send you the location. I got it. Don't go anywhere. Your dad and I will be on our way with the police. Yes, sir, thank you. Thank you. No, thank you, Wendy. Okay. Help is on the way. He told us just to sit tight and wait. You're being watched. Don't do anything until I get there. I'm leaving my office now. I'll call you again when I'm en route. Where's my dad and the police? Those aren't the police. No. Much worse. Y'all kids is in trouble! Are you sick? No, man, it's just my scary voice. My real voice is too high. They won't be intimidated. Well, you sound sick. I've got some cough drops. - I'm not sick, man! - Oh, I know what it is. - It's your stance. - Okay. - You just gotta stand like this. - Like this? - Just gotta drop your knees. - Drop! Like this? - Yeah, lift your shoulders. - Okay. Yeah. And then use right here. - You in trouble. - You in trouble! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, like that! - In trouble! - You in trouble! - You in trouble! - Like this. You in trouble! - You in trouble! - Yeah. You in trouble! - You in trouble! - You in trouble! - Enough! - You did all right, though. - Tie 'em up. Knock 'em out and throw them in the river. Okay. Okay. Drown time. Come here! No! Get off! It's time. Let's go! You won't get away with this! I already have. - Scat, kid! - Go! Yeah. Huh. We gonna drown y'all in the lake. Ah, oh, Barney. They just kids, man. And I'm an orphan. - What? - He's an orphan. - He's an orphan? - You an orphan? We can't drown the orphan, it's almost Christmas! What type of gift is that, man? - It's a horrible one. - Okay, let me think. Let me think. Let me think. Let me think. Okay, okay, okay, okay. What if, what if, what if we drop 'em off in the middle of nowhere a few miles up the road? And just leave them there? It's cold, we can't do that. You right. It's December. You right. It is December. Uh-- I got it. Give them some of that sleeping gas, just let 'em sit here. Oh, okay! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - That way we don't harm 'em. - No harm, no foul. - No harm, no foul. - Cool! Cool! - Yeah, sweet! - This is why boss put you in charge. - I know. Ahem. Excuse me, excuse me. What are you doing? - I'm just calling the police. - Give me that phone. - Hey! Hey, that's mine! - Give me that! I'm so sorry. You strong, girl! Come on, take this. Hey, this would actually be a good gift for boss. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Hey, Merry Christmas. - Hey, show some spirit, man. - Merry Christmas. - I'll see you later. - All right, Barney, I'll see you, man. Woo! All right, kids. I'mma be honest with y'all, okay? You guys is lucky. You lucky Barney has a light heart. 'Cause I wanna see y'all at the bottom of the lake! But I was thinkin', I see myself in you kids. I don't want y'all goin' down the same path I went down. 'Cause look at me now! I got two children tied to a barrel! I steal gum, I used to push over old ladies, and I went to jail! I didn't pay my traffic tickets, but that's a different story. Hey, man, I thought I shot you, man! Come here! Come here, I got-- Come here! Oh, he is fast. Come here! Oh, I'mma get him! I'mma get him! I'm sorry, boss! Funny man, sleepy. Junior, we thought we lost you. Good to see you, little buddy. We gotta get you home. But first, we have to stop the mayor. I go home after next full moon. Junior stay and help! I'll make it up to you, I promise. Come on. Oh, grab a mask. Holiday parade tonight at 8:00. You snooze, you lose! Pay no attention to the elves wearing masks. This is perfectly normal. This is the regular old Santa Claus... - Wait here, Junior. - I will this time. l promise. We have gifts in the bag and we're ready to go! Merry Christmas! Holiday parade! Bring your wife and your kids! Bring your family, bring your friends! Come out and celebrate the holiday parade tonight at 8:00! Just smile and wave, everyone, just smile and wave. Do not worry about the elves wearing masks! Woo! It's just really cold outside. It's okay! Holiday parade tonight at 8:00! You snooze, you lose! Happy holidays, everybody! We brought some gifts for you. Hey. Hey, boss! We'll be in and out before anybody wakes up. Good. No one will ever know I was here. Where's Clyde? I don't know. He doesn't get his cut if he doesn't get here soon. Gotcha. Now, for what we really came for. - Barney! - I-I'm sorry, boss. I-I thought I saw something. I don't see anything. Our money is waiting, come on! Yes, sir. Sorry! Sorry! Merry Christmas, my sleepy little citizens! Aren't they cute? Have you set the explosives yet? Yep, coming right up. Boss, that's going to be really loud. Who cares? It's not like it's gonna wake anyone up. Time to open some presents. My phone. Okay. Victory, my friend. We did it. - We did it. - The caper of a lifetime. I think we deserve to celebrate. - Look at all that money! - Woo! Ahh! - Yes! - We're rich! - Say cheese! - Cheese! Barney, I think I'm going to keep all the money, and let you take the blame for all of this. No, no, no. Y-you're joking, right? - It's okay, Barney. - No! You're joking, right? - No. - No, boss, please. No, you-- - I'll see you in prison! - No! No, boss! All right, boss! Good one! I'll be waiting around the corner, um... Go! Come on! Disperse, disperse! This way, this way, this way! - What is he doing? - I don't know. He's your dinosaur. I'm sorry, Pickles. Daddy can't take you. Not enough room. What is that little thing? I'm a dinosaur. And you're a bad man. It's over! You three have been nothing but a thorn in my side. It's time I remedy that problem. Dinosaurs are extinct! Now to make sure they stay that way! Why me? I wasn't gonna hurt anyone, I promise. We were just playing. I don't think I wanna know what happens next. Oh, thank goodness you two are safe! How are you feeling? I'm feeling great, but the police are coming. You've got to get Albert and his family back to the forest straightaway. You heard her, go! What exactly happened here? The mayor planned it all. The police will find all the evidence they need here, but the location of the lab is on my phone. They'll find Clyde sleeping like a baby. Come on, Curtis! Stay out of trouble, you. I'll try. No promises. I guess you probably have to get back soon too, right? Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. Well, we should probably go. Can we stay for just a little while longer? Yeah. - Wendy? - Yeah? - Thank you. - For what? For a month I'll never forget. I could always count on you. I never felt alone. No matter what happens, no matter where you go, we'll always be here for you. Like family? Like family. No one needs to know. Tighten those handcuffs. Really tight. Yeah, well, you need to be in a straightjacket, lady. Oh! - I'm telling you guys... - Did they get home okay? Yes! And then we made sure Junior didn't sneak away this time. Oh, good! You both did splendidly. I told the police everything. About the bank, and the lab, and not quite everything. - Wendy! Curtis! - Guys! Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh, we were so worried about you two. We thought you were downtown, but Gran called us and told us everything. - Are you okay? - Couldn't be better. Shame about Samuel. Take your hands off of me! I'm still the mayor of this town! Dinosaurs! There were dinosaurs! Argh, those kids! They'll tell you! Tell him! Knock it off. I'm telling you the truth! And one of them even talked. Did he now? Dinosaurs? Impossible. But I'm not crazy! Well, it looks like I owe you two kids an apology. It's okay, Dad. And you, Tadrina, I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I knew you'd come around. And you, Olivia. I've just been so caught up with work I forgot how... How the impossible is still possible? - Right as usual, my love. - Hmm. I'd love to meet the rest of Junior's family. I think I can make that happen. I think our town needs a new mayor. - Yeah! - Yeah. Curtis? I really hope that you enjoyed your time with us. Yes, I will never forget you all. Thank you so much. What's wrong you two? It's Christmas eve. Sorry, I don't really feel like celebrating. Come on, you don't feel like celebrating? You two just both helped stop the mayor from executing his evil plan. - And more importantly, no one was hurt. - That's right. You know, Curtis, we've really enjoyed you being part of our family this past month. Wendy? Wendy? It's just, Curtis only has a few days left with us. I don't want him to go back to the orphanage. It's okay, I... I'm used to the place. Who wants to open a present? Curtis? You go first. I-- I didn't get you anything. You being here is all we need. Glasses! Thank you so much! There's more. - Huh? - Hmm. We saw how well you two got along. - Well, after the first couple of days. - Yeah. Now, you two really take care of each other like a family should. And, to be honest, we've all become pretty attached to you. Yeah. That's right, Curtis. That's why we've decided to adopt you. You don't have to go anywhere, son. You're home. - If you'll have us. - Yes! Yes! - Gah! - Aw! Come here, guys. - Merry Christmas, Curtis. - Merry Christmas, Wendy. Merry Christmas, Junior.
