What about feelings, yeah? -All right. -See you soon. -Mmm. See you. -Okay. No one's saying it's for life. It's just until you find something else. You're the one on about helping me. Have I not helped you? Have I not helped you out -with money before? -Your brother offered you a job. I thought it was a good idea. It's temporary. Do you know what? Forget it. Paul, now's not a good time. I was calling you all day yesterday. I told you I was picking up Travis. All right, all right. Doesn't need more than a minute. Who is the best agent in the world? You're the best agent in the world. Now, what is it? Tina Turner. Where Our Love Went: The Story of Rock and Roll. West End all-star show about our legends. Oh, my God! We missed the first round scene. I got you in the second round. So get your song together and... What? Yes, Paul, yes. - Who do you love? - I love you, Paul. I love you! I'll email you the details. You have a good day and get practicing, all right, darling? Look at her. Thinks she's Mary Queen of Scots, doesn't she? Nisha! Who that man? One of them's Tyson. Look how big he is. Um, Mum, I've got to stay. I'm gonna go around Tyson's to do homework. Sorry, you'll have to reschedule Tyson, babe. I need to do homework. Can't I just go tomorrow? -I'm not even hungry. -We're going there as a family. - You can see Tyson any time-- - Oh, come on-- Hey, you heard what she said! Get in the car. Nish, you coming? See you later, Nisha. Nish, you're a ball of negative energy, -do you know that? -What? I ain't saying you can't act like her, I'm saying you don't sound like her. Your voices are different. Of course it's different. I'm a different person. It doesn't mean anything. Hi. How you doing? I was just looking at that red dress in the window. - Here. - Wow. Look at this. Yeah, it looks nice. Nish. What do you think? Look. Hmm. Yeah. How much is it, hon? Oh, the Lily Marvin? It's 279. Babe. Ask if they can hold it for a bit. Do you think you can hold it 'til the end of the month? Oh, I can only hold it for 24 hours, I'm afraid. Really sorry. - Yo. - Oh, yeah, you all right? -My brother's here? -Yeah, he's just at the front. They don't even know. So, bruv, I'm just repeating what you said, innit? You said you were all good, and I've interviewed a good guy. He was a qualified chef, in fact. - All right. - Yo, where you going? Yo, bruv. Hey, hey, hey. You give up too easy, you know that? -Where's your grip, bruv? -What? You're telling me you gave the job to someone else. What, you want me to fucking beg you? Sit down. Sit down. Do you know what the definition of grit is? When a man does not take "no" for an answer. You don't need to be quoting no Tony Robbins to me, G. I'm trying to impart some wisdom, little bro. And yes, you should be begging me. Here's what I can do. Kitchen porter. Doing the dishes, nothing much, 8.50 an hour. If you're up for that, then maybe I can help you. Hey, that's all I got. Look at you. Man's right now, innit? Do you want a job or not? How did you afford this? I got a job. Not with Clive? Come over here. Excuse me? Who do you think you're talking to? You little bitch. Who's my little bitch? Did you not hear me? Yeah. I did. Let me hear you say it, then. I'm a little bitch. Mmm... I can't hear you. I'm your little bitch. Turn. Let me see you. More. I wanna see more. Oh, my God. You're gonna kill it. Don't be calling 'em dickheads, all right? Get off. Brush your teeth before you kiss me like that! Nisha. You're not gonna wish me luck? Uh, sorry. Good luck. What are you doing later? Wanna have a little girl's trip after school? You're the one always saying we're broke. Yeah, but we can have a look and then buy it when I get paid next week. Come on. Don't you wanna get something nice? Look peng for all the boys? -No. -Look peng for the girls, then? What's your issue? I ain't got no issue, hon. I just wanna spend time together like mum and daughter. Do you know what? Forget it. Go on, Nish. Fucking bitch. Cicely. -Was that your mum? -Yeah. She's so pretty. I was watching her on YouTube again the other day. Oh, my God, why, man? Fill me in, come on. So, like, are your mum and dad banging 24/7 -now that he's back from jail? -Hey, chill out. You're the one that said you heard them -banging for ten hours. -No, I didn't. -Yeah, you did. -Chill out, chill out. Hey, Cicely. Come here a minute. See you later, yeah? Candice May? Yes. - Hey, everyone. - Hi. Hey, Candice. John, hey. Thank you. So, Candice, how are you? - I'm okay, thank you. - Good. Your agent told us we're about to meet Tina Turner herself. Oh, no, I'm just a bit of a stan. Thank you for letting me come in today. -You're very welcome. -That dress is gorgeous! Thank you very much. Thank you. -Yeah, it's really gorgeous. -Thank you. So, what are you singing for us today? "River Deep, Mountain High." "River Deep, Mountain High." Brilliant. Are we good to go? - Yeah. - John? I'm so sorry. Do you mind if we start again? - Sure. John? - Thank you. Fantastic. How'd it go? You turned me into Tina Turner. I weren't spying on you, mate. I-- I just wanted to check on you, you know? I'm fine. All right. - Are you sure? - Dad. What's all this about? I-- I just wanted you to know that-- well, I'm here for you. If there's anything going on inside you wanna tell me about, I-- I'm here to listen. Shit. Fuck. What are you doing home? Huh? What you doing? What's that? - What do you think you're doing? - Sorry. This don't belong to you, does it? - Does it? - No, sorry. What are you doing? They want me back. -Serious? -Yeah. - What? - Yes, babe. Come on! Ah! Oh... oh, yeah. - My girl. - Yes. Mm-hmm. Come on. - Hey, what's this? - You all right, babe? -How you doing, love? -Mmm, good, thanks. How are you? I'm good. You are looking fire. -Thank you, thank you. -Celebrating, are we? Yeah. Did Trav not tell you who I'm auditioning for? No, what's this? I got a recall to play Tina Turner in a new musical. -Is it? -Yeah. Well, that's something to celebrate proper, bruv. She want some Prosecco, not a shot. - No, I'm good. - No, no, no, no, no. We're celebrating, and you deserve it. Tell you what. Trav, give Ter a hand with the stock check and you can get off at half past. I'll sort Candy a drink. What, don't you wanna get home early? Nah, you two enjoy yourselves, yeah? - I'll wait for you, babe. - Cool. All right? - You good? - Oh, yeah. -How's things? -Oh, lovely. Sorry about him. It doesn't hurt to celebrate. Ike and Tina? I was at the Everly Brothers concert. -You seen it? -Of course I have. Still looking for lead vocals, I tell you. Did you just roll your eyes? -No, I was blinking. -Oi. The gig in the pub, babe, yes. You've told me several times. How about we rehearse a couple of Ike and Tina covers? Get you in shape. Come on, it'd be lush. Look, I'll think about it, all right? No promises. -You're joking me. -What? Daughter's fucking teachers again. Hang on. What's she done now? But I didn't touch her, did I? You chased her. She slipped and fell. Why the fuck did you chase the girl? It was her fault! She was too rude. Mr. Frank said this is the last time, the last. Do you know what that means? One more strike and you're done. But I didn't do anything, she started it. Nish, you better pipe down, hon, I swear to God, Nish. If you get expelled, I'm fucking-- That's it. Do you know how much I've had to sacrifice for you? I asked you to sacrifice nothing. Can you just shut your mouth? I'm not even joking. You think I'm working like a dog to keep a roof over your head for you to put the stress on my back? Travis, wh-- what are you doing? Why are you in my dress? What are you doing? Uh... nothing. I was just... messing about. Gonna show you later. You were gonna show me later? Yeah. -Whoa, what are you doing? -Taking a picture. -No, no! -Why? You said you were messing! -Give me the phone. -Travis, give me my phone back. -Give me the phone! -Travis. Travis. -Give me my phone. -Give me the phone Give me my phone! Travis! Travis! -Hey. In a minute! -Give me my phone. - What the fuck? - Oh. Nish! -It's nothing. -Why are you in Mum's dress for? Kenisha, leave us alone a minute. Why are you in Mum's-- Kenisha, leave the room, please. Why are you in Mum's dress for? Kenisha, I said leave us. Get out now! Okay, let me just... let me just... what are you doing? I told you. I was... I wanted to put it on, like, messing about. To surprise you later. Is there something you're not telling me here? No. No! Travis, you're wearing my makeup and my dress -and dancing around like a-- -What? Are you, like, harboring some kind of feelings about something? -Babes, listen, no! -Are you into it? -No! No, no, all right? -Travis, you're-- you're whining like a ladyboy in my dress. What the fuck are you chatting about? What am I chatting about? You're wearing my fucking dress. So what, then? Right. Can you just-- can you just take it off? 'Cause we need to talk seriously, -and you are stretching it. -All right! - Oh, my God. - Fuck! Candy, man! I'm fucking playing! All right? I'm fucking high as fuck, man. I felt like being silly, all right? I'm being silly. Put the dress on 'cause I wanted to see if I could look as good as you. -And my knickers? -Candy, listen-- -Is this why you're always... -Babe, babe-- ...looking at my dresses, buying me clothes, 'cause you wanna wear 'em and try 'em on? All right, look, all right. You know me. Yeah? Hello? I was bored, and I felt like being stupid, all right? One sec. Mum, Donna's on the phone. -Take it off. -All right, cool. - Mum? - Cool. - Hello? - I'm playing. You know me. I'm fucking crazy, innit? You know, I was-- I was gonna jump out at you, yeah? When you came back, and... What do you think? Think I look good, though? -Take it off. -All right! -Take it off. -I'm getting it off! Look! What is wrong with you? You wait there, 'cause we ain't done. We're not done. Why was he wearing your dress? Hey, pass the ball. You're rubbish, bro! Hey, you mans. What you saying? - Nish! - Nathan, Nathan, Nathan. Hey, bro, bro! Yesterday... I was... It isn't what you think, all right? I was smoking a lot of buds. It was a joke. Hey, ain't that deep. You hear what I said? Have you done it before? Nah. Just a likkle prank. How was work? Clive getting on your nerves? Eh. He's all right. What? I wanted to talk to you about yesterday. Shh! Trav! Just wanna ask you something. Do you think you were born in the wrong body? -Do you think you were, like-- -I told you yesterday. I'm asking you to be honest. What did I say? Travis, look... I know you're a bit... different. Like I'm a bit different. You know me, I'm like a free spirit. I like to play, but, like, fantasy, yeah? Fantasy to me is not reality. Do you know what I mean? Fantasy is fantasy, innit? And you know I like to have fun, but... I like it as fantasy. Does that make sense? Told you. It was... I wanted to make you fucking laugh. Yeah, I know you were experimenting. I know you've been stressed, babe. This is a lot. I really appreciate everything you've been doing. Come here. Now, let's head back to stateside 1976... No. You come here. Bend over. "Ladies, our friend here wants to see how you pony." - Mum! - One sec, I'm coming. If I'm late, it's your fault. Mum! Okay, babe, I'm coming. You all right there? Yeah. -Mum? -Mm-hmm? Um... there's this boy at school that I kinda like. Excuse me? - Excuse me? - Like, I just wanna-- Mum! Okay! Go on, go on, go on. I just wanted to know, like, how would you show a boy you liked him, personally... -Uh-huh. -Yeah. Like, as a female. We've been chilling and stuff, but I think he just thinks that we're friends. Well, it's the five senses, babe. Right, you listening? Yeah. Eye contact. Very, very important. Touch. Touch his arm, touch his hand. Sound. Voice. Don't overlook it. Talk. Like, laugh at all of his shit jokes. Smell. Ah! Excuse me, appreciate the smell. That's Chanel. You'll get him going with that one. And last but not least, taste. Well, you can save that one for when you two are... mmm! Chill out! Such a pervert. What the hell? Okay. This boy, what's his name? Uh, Reggie. Reggie. Okay. Well, I'm sure Reggie doesn't wanna go out with... Well, you're looking a little bit like Reggie right now, hon. And Reggie doesn't wanna be with Reggie, does he? Babe, let me just take you shopping. We can go next week. We don't like each other's clothes. There's no point in shopping together. -How many fucking times? -Oi! Excuse me? Oh! Fuck! Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Boss! Hey, can you fix this? No, we don't do that. What does the sign say, bruv? You can do it? Come back later, yeah? - No. Tomorrow. 1:00 p.m. - Tomorrow? No, no, no. - I need it today. - No. -I'll give you double. -No, no, no. No. You know what, give me the thing. Nish! -Yo, Kenisha! -Oh, hi! - Yeah. - What are you doing? Let me grab you a sec. One sec. - That's her dad. - You all right? Yo, I need you to do me a favor. -What? -Uh, so I accidentally put your mum's red dress in the wash, yeah? I put it in the wash, you know, I wanted, um, um... high spins, and I took it out, and look. So I need you to do me a favor and just say you did it. -You're joking me. -Don't need to say you put it in the wash. Just say you was trying it on, and-- and you ripped it. Why can't you just say you put it in the wash? 'Cause she's gonna think I tried it on again and I didn't, yeah? It was an accident. Nish. Her audition's tomorrow. Yeah? You know how bad she wants this. Like she's gonna believe I put on? She ain't gonna believe me, is she? Huh? You know, I-- I was just trying to help her out, and boom, it was a mistake. She's gonna believe you, though. Huh? Trust. Here. Take this, yeah? Fucking shit. -What's this? -Whoa, whoa, you all right? What's wrong? - I don't know what it is. - Am I a prick to you? - What are you talking about? - What's wrong? Kenisha, leave us alone, please. What's-- what's wrong? Your dad thinks I'm a fucking mug. Babe, I didn't do nothing. -This is nothing, is it? -You're fucking mad. -You're a fucking liar. A liar! -Calm down, it was me. I borrowed it earlier. Sorry. I didn't realize I broke it. Kenisha, do you know how much this costs? Apologize to your dad. I'm sorry. I needed this for tomorrow. I know, but I wanted to try it on because you said Reggie wouldn't like my clothes. All right, Nish. Just... leave us alone a minute. I'm so sorry, baby. I'm sorry. Vivian Aforé? Okay, this is gonna sound weird, yeah, but... ...I think your dad is proper sexy. Like, you can't deny it. Your mum and dad are buff, though. How do you think you turned out so peng? Stop perving on my family, bruv. Should only be thinking of Bradley. Fam, I'm so done with that wasteman. But you like mandem, right? I don't like the way he was acting all bad. I like sensitive boys, boys that aren't afraid of expressing themselves. You get me? Mmm. Yeah, my dad's kinda like that. Like, he don't play, but he's, like, sensitive as well. -Hmm, really? -Shut up, bruv. How is he sensitive? What? You can't tell no one. Tell me. Okay. Um... well, sometimes... he likes to dress in my mum's clothes. - Oh, wow. - Shut up, man. Wait, wait. Like RuPaul's Drag Race? Hmm? I don't know, like, he just likes to wear her clothes sometimes. But he says he's pranking, but I don't know. That's. I think that's kind of like this box that society puts us in, and your dad said, "Fuck that box." It's pretty hot. Can't tell no one. I promise. I swear on my life. I saw you watching me. I really like the way you girls dance. Is that so? Ladies, our friend over here wants to know how you pony. Lovely job. Well done, you two. That was great. Thanks, Candice. -How'd that feel? -Yeah. Felt good. Danny, we'll grab you in five. -Cheers. -Thanks, Danny. Shaun, sorry about the song. My voice is a bit strained. You know how many shows you'd do in a week if you got the job? - Six. - Yes. Sometimes two on Saturdays. That's seven. See what I mean? No room for a strained voice. I know how to take care of myself-- Tina Turner was an athlete. These roles are for athletes. Athletes in training. It'd take all your focus. There'd be no time for any... any distractions. Shaun, honestly, I don't know why you're telling me this. I know. Don't you think I know? Well, great. Thanks for coming in. I'd love for you to come in again. Do you think you can come back on Friday? Yes. Definitely. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. He wants you back, though? Yeah, but they'll have me in eight times and then tell me they don't want me. He literally said he wants you back. Yeah, but it doesn't always work that way, does it? You need to chill. Hold on a second. Is that... What? -What? -It's Nish. Wait. Hey! - Kenisha. - Oh, my God. - Come with me. - No. So that's Reggie, yeah? - You're Reggie, are ya? - Who's Reggie? Reggie is a boy my daughter told me she liked. Which is hilarious, 'cause it seems to me he's now a lesbian. So I'm just wondering, what happened to Reggie, hmm? But don't you worry. I'm used to it now. It's fucking colors of the rainbow in my family. -Kenisha, let's go. Now. -Just shut up! Who do you think you're talking to? -Come with me, now. -No! Kenisha, get your arse in the fucking car now! - Hey, calm down! - Kenisha! - I fucking hate you! - Nish! Um, I think I'm just gonna... Can't stop her liking who she likes. Who's trying to stop her? She made up this whole elaborate fucking thing -about a boy called Reggie. -I'm saying she probably don't feel like she can be real with you. What you mean, she can't be real with me? Did I say she couldn't like who she likes? You probably made her feel like she couldn't say. -I don't know! -And who are you right now? Oprah, yeah? And I'm the devil. Have you thought about how you might be influencing her-- Hey, I ain't influencing no one! -You make me laugh. -Seriously, shut up, Candice! Do you know how worried we've been? Like you care. Look, Nish, I'm sorry. I just... I don't like that you lied to me. There's too much lying going on. Is this funny, yeah? Why'd you break my dress? You did it on purpose, didn't you? You did, didn't you? Wow. You ungrateful bitch. Do you know where I'd be if it weren't for you? Shouldn't have had me, then, should you? - Baby. - Mm? Thank you for fixing the dress. Travis, I'm not sure about all of this. I don't know if I'm good enough. What? I was just thinking about... the first time I heard you singing at. I looked at you, and I thought... "She's mine." Thought we were gonna be Jay-Z and Beyoncé, didn't we? I had fuckin' goosebumps. You would've never asked me that. What's goin' on? Hmm? Need to get the old confidence back. I wanna see you in it again. Please. Miss Vaush. I thought you might stay longer. We can't always trust our thoughts, honey. The way I see it... -Thought you was revising? -I'm taking a break. Sometimes I'll say goodbye before the finish. Leave him wanting more. I'm trying to watch this. Well, I must say, you were sensational tonight. I mean, just sensational! Last night was a one-off. We ain't doing that again. Mr. Flynn, it's been a wonderful evening. Remember who wanted it? Well, maybe you should've been more assertive if you feel that strongly. You could've told me no. I don't own you. Anyways, I'm just saying. Don't think we're making that a habit. What I've been telling you about fire and safety? Yeah, sorry about that. I forgot about that. Yeah, yeah. I can't reset the end of the wires, Friday. -Friday? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Friday? - Yeah. But he's got a number he can give you. All right, give me the number. Yeah. Oh, fuck! Fuck. Fuck, man. The fuck's going on? Oh, don't worry, man. It's nothing. What? Nothing. I just thought you stopped all that shit when you was a kid. They Candy's? They Candy's, innit? Hey, don't worry, bro. You know your secret's always been safe with me, and-- Oi! That's coming out of your fuckin' wages! Do I give a fuck? You know what? You've always been an ungrateful little brat. Fuckin' Mum fussing over you all the time and I'm the one, again, cleaning up your mess. Yeah. All right. All right. All right. Easy. I'm just trying to find out... what's going on in that freaky little head. That's it. 'Cause you know you ain't acting normal, right? What? A man-- a man sees his little brother just out of prison and wearing his girl's knickers. What-- -Don't-- -...can't ask what-- All right, bro. All right. Okay. -Move the-- move out my way. -Bro. Bro. All right, my bad. My bad. I just need you to act like a responsible man. Don't you think your lady deserves that? You know she does. And what I do need you to think about is who the fuck you're working for. If you don't wanna do that... you know where the door is. Don't you? Oi, dickhead. Why didn't you text me back? What are you always hitting me for? Because you're wet. What? All right, Ben, tell her what they said to me. -Bennett, tell her, man. -Okay, all right. Basically we heard that Mad T is actually gay -and turned into a female. -Who said that? Cecily and Malcolm. Ay, yo, why are you snitching, man? Why is she spreading shit? That's fuckin' dumb.- -That's why he went in jail. -Did he even go to jail? -Why would I lie about that? -Because my man's a pervert. Man, she's a pervert? You better shut the fuck up about my dad. Ay, yo, calm down, man. What we're trying to say is that, that's why he likes prison, innit? 'cause, like, in prison men like getting their-- you know, their dicks sucked by she-males-- Yeah? Uh, no, but you can speak to me. I'm Travis Clark, her dad. What's happened? Hey! Why are you always moving mad for? Do you wanna tell your mum about this? -I don't care. -What did I tell you? I told you to keep your head down, didn't I? It's your fucking fault. What'd you say? Oi. They were laughing about you. How come they were laughing about me? Hey! They were calling you gay. What do you expect? What are they calling me gay for? Hmm? I told my friend that you were wearing mum's dress. What did you say that for? She promised not to tell no one. It was a fucking joke, Kenisha. I told you I was pranking! You're not joking because you've done it before. Just stop lying! Hey, Nish, Nish, Nish, Nish! Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! You're right. Okay? You're right. And that's my fault. I'm sorry. Listen. We'll keep this one quiet for a minute, yeah? Your mum, she got enough stress right now with her audition. I don't give a shit about her stress. Oi, when you suddenly think it's okay to just swear all the time? You're always swearing. Yeah, 'cause I'm an adult. Hey. You ain't supposed to swear in front of adults. Dad? Hmm? You know, if you're gay, you really should break up with Mum. What is this about me being gay? Huh? Why am I gay? A friend said that some men turn, like, women in prison-- Fucking no. All right? No. Don't know why they were calling me gay for and you're the one who's fucking gay, not me. But why though? I don't know what's going on, you know, and... I just like being pretty sometimes. And that's it. What? Don't you think that's a bit off-key? I'm not saying it's not. Maybe I'm just a bit off-key, innit? I am too. A bit? Right, you're more than a bit, mate. I wanna show you something. Come and show it off at school. No, don't do that. I'll show you what I got. - Never do that. - Where you been? I took her to Nando's, innit? -Oi. -Hmm? -How was school? -It was good. Good. I'm not watching the news. - You're watching the news. - Trav. Deb called about the party for Clive on Saturday. I said we'd go. I know you both don't wanna go, but I think we should. I want us all to do something normal, all-together, like a family. Cool. Be nice to see grandma, innit? -Yeah. -Yeah? Yeah. Good. Um, I'm going to school now. We'll give you a lift. Um, I'm getting a lift from Addy. - Okay. - Good luck. Thanks, babe. Nish. Give me a hug. -Bye. -Bye. Listen to the story. Fantastic. Where's the picture? She took it down. Look who it is. How are you, my little cherub? Hi! I'm so glad you're out. You look good. Please make sure you look after yourself. - Doesn't she shut up? - How you doing? Like that, is it? Cheers. -Come, let's go. -All right. Your brother's gonna be here any minute. And as soon as he comes in, we're all gonna make some noise. Oi, none of that, please. Why are we acting like it's a surprise party when he knows about it? Will you tell your dad to behave? What's going on, brother? -Maji! You all right, man? -What's happening, family? You all right, yeah? Deb, Deb, Deb. He's here! - Oi.? What? What? You're killing me! What are you doin'? Wow. Hey. Hey, hey. How it is, yeah? Hey! Oh, looking sharp, bro. Yeah, a little bit of effort in that. -I like it, I like it. -Happy birthday, man. Yo, what's this, fam, hmm? Oh, bro. You know I could get about five of these for the price of one, right? Yeah. All right, give it back then. No, bro, chill, chill, chill. I'm joking. Come on. - Come on, I appreciate it. - Hmm. Hey, I'm glad you're here, innit. Hey, glad you're here. -Come here, bro. -We cool? Yes, brother. Yes, brother. Look at his bow tie. Don't take him seriously. Okay? -Mmm. -All right. - Huh, huh, hey! - Hey! - Party time! - Hey! I'm just saying, brother. That's what I'm saying. Like, Kenisha, you see your dad, yeah? You know, your dad used to be a bad boy MC, innit? You know, man used to make rhythms for him, innit. Record label was on this thing. What I'm trying to say is, yeah, man needs to start up the thing, yeah? My friend here works for this record label, -and I reckon-- -Nah, none of that. I'm gettin' too old for all of that stupidness. Eh? a lifeline. Uh, I hear you. But what I'm trying to say is... Good night, everybody. Hey, everybody, make some noise for the birthday boy. Gather, my peeps, come gather. Don't wanna keep you too long. Man's 40 years old and still winning, innit? No, just thank you to my beautiful mother. Where is she there? There she is. Miss Deborah Clark, the famous. Uh, Mum? Hey, I want you to keep the second week of September free, yeah, 'cause, um, I'm taking you to... Yeah. Mum, that's for all them years guiding me, yeah? Love you, Mum. Yeah? Oh, yeah. And, uh, you see this-- this banner up here, yeah? "Welcome back, Travis!" Yeah, back out after a year. He's doing well. He's working with me, providing for his family and, um, we've spoken a lot about mistakes and how we learn from our mistakes and we better ourselves, and we can't become ourselves until we find ourselves. And I really believe that my little brother Travis is finding himself right now. So let's all just raise our glasses... to my little brother. Welcome back. Hold on. Put 'em up, put 'em up. We've also got a star in the building. Yeah. She's about to play Tina Turner in here! Oh, my God. Stop. Please, come on. - Are you ready? - Yeah, sir. I want everyone to take in the lyrics to this song, yeah? Let's go. Let's go. All right, come on, here we go. All right, Okay. Come on now. We all know this track, innit? Get your two-step on. Come on, let me see your two-step. Come on! Get crunk, come on! Hey! Hey! Tell them, y'all! Wind down, wind down. Come on then! Yeah! Yo! - Trav, come here, man. - Yo!

Yeah? -Yeah, I think so. -Yeah. So-- so, if you're here with Belinda, yeah, you don't need to be putting hands all over my girl, do you? What are you on about now, bro? Fucking heard me, G. She's with me. -She's my girl. -Wow. Hey, sorry about this. My little bro's had a little bit too much to drink, he's getting a little bit hype right now-- You don't need to be flirting, playing songs, or rubbing anything in my face, yeah? She's with me, you understand? She ain't into fucking plebs. And you can play Mum or you buy Mum all the tickets you want to Jamaica, but who did that first, yeah? Hmm? - Who is the original one? - What's going on? Nothing, babe. Little bro smoked too much weed in his life and he's got his head all fucked up. And you know what? I could say a lot. Hmm? I don't wanna be that person. He just needs to have some fucking gratitude. He needs to keep his fucking knickers on. - Get up! - What's wrong--? What are you gonna do, huh? -Huh? -Fuck is that? I'll fuck you up! Yeah? Come on, then! Get off me, get off me! Travis, get off him, Travis! What are you fucking doing, man? Calm down, man. You have 30 new messages. New message from 02892454575. Uh, hi, this is Mr. Frank from Fairman. I can't reach either of you on your mobiles. Mr. Clark, I had a chat with the governors about Kenisha's expulsion, and I think it'd be good for you and Miss May to pop in. I'll either be able to do 3:00 or 4:00 p.m. on Monday. Um, let me know. It's Friday 14th of May, 2:47. Travis? Uh, Hi, this is Mr. Frank from Fairman. I can't reach either of you on your mobiles. Mr. Clark, I had a chat with the governors about -Kenisha's expulsion... -I didn't wanna say anything 'cause you-- you had your audition and... ...you was excited about the party. What did she do? It's Friday 14th of May 2:47. She's got into another fight. New message from 02... Look, it's my fault. I told her not to say anything. I want you to take this, pack your bags, and get out. What're you doing? What's wrong with you? Don't touch me. Don't fucking touch me. -What is-- -Do you know what you are? You're the biggest mistake of my life. The biggest mistake of your life, eh? -Yeah. -Yeah? Yeah. Well, you weren't saying that when I was paying for everything. You need to have a fucking look at yourself-- Everything you touch, you fuck up -'cause you are such a fuck up! -Hey, hey! Get out of my fucking way. Get off of me! -Calm down! -Get the fuck off of me. Get off of me. I'll get off when you calm down. - What-- - Get out! -What are you screaming for? -Go to bed! All the time I've wasted on you, you've actually ruined my life and for what? - Fucking nothing! Ruined! - Calm down! Ruined! I told you to get out, Kenisha! Not until you fucking stop! - Get out! - Kenisha. Oh, fuck's sake. Hi. Is everything all right? We've heard about -lots of shouting and banging-- -Sorry, it's been a bit loud-- Oh. Fucking great. What's this? We just need to make sure everyone's okay. -Can we come in for a moment? -No, no, you can't. You can tell the little bitch next door we knew it was her. -Let's just calm down. -What you think you're doing? All right, just so you know, we are both wearing body cameras. You are being filmed. Yeah, well, you can film yourself trespassing because you're barging in my house without my permission. Miss, we have a duty of care. There's a child in this house and-- I can shout if I wanna shout in my house. If this is a verbal warning, you need to stop shouting if we're gonna get anywhere. If you don't stop yelling at us, we'll have to arrest you-- - For what? - Babe, just stop-- Arrest me for telling you you can't come in my house? I should have you fucking arrested. -Right, you're making a mi-- -Take your hands off me! -Wait! No! -Okay, okay. Stay back, sir. Now I'm arresting you for assaulting an officer. You don't have to say anything, but it may harm your defense if you don't mention when questioned something you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given... It's Paul. Your agent. Do you not wanna know what's going on? Pass me the phone. I didn't get it. You all right? Yeah. Wasn't meant to be. - I want you to take it. - You do? - I don't need it now, do I? - I got it for you. But you look better in it. I'm a big woman, innit? Time for me to stop being someone I'm not. -Look where you're going, bro. -The fuck! -What? -What? -Come, then! -Fuck off, man. Nisha. Your dad's gone to stay with Victor for a while. When's he coming back? I don't know. We just need some space. I just came to say I'm sorry, babe, for what I said. It was horrible of me and not true. I've been a shit mum and I'm gonna do better. I'll call up to school and I'll explain we've had some shit going on. What? Why are you pulling that face? I don't wanna go back to school. Why not? No one likes me. Oh, come on, they all love you up there. No, they don't. I told Cicely that Dad was wearing your dress and she told everyone that he's gay and a she-male. Is Cecily the one you were-- She said that after you-- Nah. Didn't like her from the off. Them stush pretty girls will eat you up and spit you out. Why did you make Dad leave? Babe, he was not behaving like he should. It's a lot of things. No. I don't get it. He is off-key. You're off-key. So why can't you guys just deal with it? -Like, what's your issue? -Nisha. You just don't worry about us, okay? Yo, yo, yo. Yo. What's winding, bro? Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. What, it looks funny? What, I look funny, huh? Yeah, you do look funny, bro. Hey, get off me, man. Hey, relax. The fuck is wrong with you, Travis, man? Whoa. You all right? -What's wrong? -You need to move, bro. -What's wrong, bro? -You're gay, man. -You think I'm joking? -You know what, bro?

This is free, bruv. - Yo! - Hey, back the fuck off! You fucking dumb or something? Are you playing games? Stop playing games. Trav, I told you stop playing games. We're all playing, bro. -We're all fucking played. -Hey, relax, man. All of you men are fucking played. Are you all right, bro? All right. Bro. I'm calm, man. Calm yourself. Yeah? I'm a star. Bro.

Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. Uh, I just come from probation. Oh, hey, Travis. We were just-- Uh, wait, Mr. Frank, Mr. Frank, um... You know what? This is all my fault. - Look-- - Um, that boy that-- That boy should be punished. He was taking the piss out of me 'cause... I'm just a bit crazy, some-- Not crazy, like... I express myself differently... in women's clothes. But apparently them lot found out and was calling me gay and she was just sticking up for her dad, you know? You know, I just come out of jail a few weeks back, right? You know that, yeah? Yeah. See, this is all my fault. - Travis-- - It's my fault. -Mr-- Mr. Clark, we just-- -Please, sir, I promise you. I'll give my life to make sure she don't get in no more trouble. That's my girl. All my life. Please just give her one more chance. Thank you, Travis. Miss May has explained quite a lot. It's good news. The governors have agreed to give her one more chance under the condition that she sees our counselor twice a week. - Come here. - Yeah. We've got a name for the band now. Candy and the Summits. What? Does it sound stupid? -Candy and the Summits? -Mm-hmm. No, I like it. I like it. You know, I was thinking though. What? What were you thinking? I was thinking... maybe it's time for us to get married. What? You don't wanna marry me? No. Go on. Vic's waiting for you. -You got it, yeah? -Yeah, yeah, now slide it. Yeah, we're good.
