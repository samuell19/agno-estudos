The prod ucers of the show say the clown's identity is a secret no one will ever know. Who's the man behind the mask? ''BINGO - THE KING OF THE MORNINGS'' A rabbit? Hi, Mr. Rabbit. Do you want to be friends? -Friends with a fox? - Yes. -Are you crazy? -Why? Foxes are tricky. - You'll want to eat me. -No, I'm different. I'm vegetarian, I like to eat carrots, just like you. -Carrots? - Yes. Argh, I like hamburgers. And I'm the one with the bad reputation . Listen here, fox. If you don't bring me a hamburger for dinner, I swear I'm going to eat you ! Help! Help! Somebody save a helpless fox! Augusto, we still have three scenes to shoot. The crew's waiting. Be careful. There's a very hungry rabbit in here. This is the last scene, OK? Then we'll go out for dinner. Stay here. Can I trust you? Can I? The love lamp! Can someone bring the love lamp to the set, please! Are you ready, Augusto? One minute. C'mon, Baron . -Ready? -Always. Ready to roll. Camera ! ''The Love Lamp''. Scene 6, take 3. Action ! Life's not a joke, huh . Bye, dad ! Wait, monkey. Did you kiss your grandma goodbye? -Yes, but she was asleep. -Did you wash this apple? Yes. -Did you brush your teeth? -Yes. You could do a movie for kids. Yeah, I have to do that. -Promise? -Yes. You'll see my next movie with all your friends from school. -Can I tell them? -Wait. Let's think about the movie first. -It's got to be cool. -It'll be very cool. -The coolest in town . -In the planet. -In the galaxy. -In the universe! Ang?lica's got a new car? Didn't she tell you? -Love you, monkey. -Love you more. Hi, baby. THE LOVE LAMP It's true then! Wait! I'm married. The lamp genie only helps married ladies. So hurry! My husband could be here any minute. Hurry? You must be crazy. If you were in a carriage, I would you start by the donkey. Life's not a joke, huh. Hi, Marcelo. Whiskey, please. And my wife? Lunch with her friends at the club. Then, she'll go to the salon. We have some time? Time for what? People think I have it all, but there are two things I miss. Time and you. What's he whining about? The show is off the air because of the ratings. It's off the air because it sucked . No, you deal with it, I'm busy. Talk later. Carry on, boy. So I was listening to your conversation ... My movies are all blockbusters, box-office hits. I honestly think I can help with ratings. Do you know how many times I've heard this bullshit? Help with ratings? When national movies do well, they have up to two million spectators. Here at Mundial we reach 90 million spectators a day. We're talking primetime soap operas. Primetime soap opera? Yeah, I promised Ang?lica . You're offering me a role in a primetime soap opera? This girl keeps my ratings up. I'd like to give something back. Hi. Who would've thought? Hi, Augusto. Together again on a set. Now with our clothes on . Thanks for the help. I didn't do it for you, I did it for Gabriel. I'd forgotten how sweet you are. By the way, I'm working late. Can you take him? No problem . Lots of scenes? -About twelve. -Twelve? I have one line in one scene. ''Sir, your car is ready.'' Someone makes money writing that. Good morning, how are you? -Hi, good morning . -Good morning . -How are you? -How's it going? -Morning . -Morning . Hi, director. I need your help. -And you are? -Augusto Mendes. I'm the lead in ''Golden Horn'', ''Megalomaniac Nymphets, ''The Love Lamp''. -You must have watched them . -I need to shoot. So, boss... Give me a chance and I'll make the audience pee their pants. You need to focus. You are on ! -Fine. -Ready? Let's go. A second, please. C'mon, Baron. OK.. Attention... Action. Sir, your car is ready. OK., thank y ou. The brakes were failing, but I fix ed them myself. OK., thank you. You can count on me. Always. OK., thank you. I'd never let you get into an accident over a brake failure. Sure, thank you. After all, you only want to skid on the secretary's curves. Right? Cut! So, was it good? If you want to help, act like a prop. A prop? Better to be a prop here at Mundial than a lead elsewhere. -Tell him, Rog?rio. -There's no life outside Mundial. I'm an actor, an actor needs lines. I don't need a talking vase in my soap opera . -Vase? -Calm down, Augusto. Listen, you can get someone else to be a vase in your soap opera . I'm out. What is talent to you people? A beautiful nose, straight teeth? Is that talent? You'll regret this. You'll be saying : ''Fuck, I had Augusto Mendes and didn't give him a chance.'' One day, this silver lady will kiss the sole of my shoes. -Good morning . -Good morning, pal. Augusto Mendes, actor. Son to the great Marta Mendes. And this is her grandson . I'm here to audition for the soap opera . OK. Open the gates. Hi, where's the audition for the soap opera? -Over there. -Thanks. Hey, what is this other line? -For ''Bingo the Clown''. -Bingo the Clown? Yeah, we're building a studio for his show. -Tons of lighting ... -The clown will have a studio? Bingo's been a top-rated show in the U .S. for 10 years. Can I audition for the clown instead? Are you a clown? Hello, kids! How are you? Are you ready for a fun morning? I'm sure you are! We're going to play a lot... -What happened? -Thank you, you can go. Seriously? Three buses to get here... You can get changed now. -What happened? -We have your contact, you can go. Vasconcelos, this is not a break. Don't leave the studio. Wally! -Valdemar? You know what to do. -Yeah . Come with me. Son ... Don't ever let anyone do that to you . -Do what? -Humiliate you . I bet $1000 you can't do it. Where's Vasconcelos? C'mon . Just a second . Ready? Action! My dear Brazilian friends! Who wants to play with me? Wally? Augusto... Augusto what? Augusto Mendes, actor? How many has he trashed? A hundred . Knock them dead . On this mark? Hey gambler, -what time does it start? -Only God knows. Is God very busy? This fucking gringo is getting bummed today, isn't that right? Who does this motherfucker think he is? Is he better than us? Why's that? I think he wants to get rear-ended . Why are you looking at me, you don't understand a word. So pals, does he get rear-ended or not? He'll go back to his country all chafed and with white ointment up his ass! So guys, does he get rear-ended -or not? -Yes! -Yes or no? -Yes! Yes! The candidate is so sweet and hardworking, and he has a beautiful smile. He's going to the throne, I give him a 1 0. He sounds like a goose out of tune. And with a missing tooth . Yes, you're going to the throne so I can flush you . -Mrs. Marta ! -My son ! Honey. Mom . Mom, I have to tell you something . But you have to sit down . -What? -Please, sit down . You'll love it. I got a part at TVP. It's not just a small role. I'm the lead in a clown show. -A clown, son? -Yes, a clown . Who says the truth in Shakespeare's plays? You've done them all, you know what I mean . The clown is a classic, Marta . It's not for everyone. I'm not talking about a shitty circus. It's the biggest hit in American TV. The big one. I'm going to have lines, pages full of letters just for me. Four hours on air every day. A very successful show in American TV? A big hit. Top-rated for 10 years. No more butt on the screen? No way. Your son is gonna have tons of lighting on him . Don't you always say we have to be on the spotlight? Some people are ants, some people are cicadas. We are moths. We need light in order to survive. It's all there. Is this the Bible or my contract? It's just your contract. Live show, five days a week, exclusivity for a year. And the main part: absolute secrecy. Nobody knows who Bingo is, got it? And this is not a detail. And why all the secrecy? It's the same in the U .S. Read it. You could be fined, fired and whatnot. Take a look at it. Where do I sign? Last page, but you have to initial all of them . Guys, why aren't you excited? This is a clown show. Let's have fun ! Let's dance. C'mon, poodle head . Give me your best moves. Loosen up! Come on, poodle head . What's going on? They're helping me rehearse the script. Peter Olsen is waiting . I'm anxious to meet the big boss. -Remembering ... -No droopy tips, Ana . I wouldn't keep him waiting if I were you . Everybody on the set in 5! TV people are very stressed out. My costume! Lucia . Clear the set. Everyone out. Gambler, you owe me $1000. You clown . -Shouldn't I talk like a clown? -Can you do that? Oh yeah, Mr. Walker.

What? My son won't find this funny. Neither will his friends. -Your son? -Gabriel. This show's been a hit in 50 American states for 10 years. But this is Brazil, there's no swagger. Since you owe me money... He's the boss. Don't be crazy. Mundial is 8 points ahead . Anyone can do the possible. It's the impossible that gives me a boner. Listen here. Pay close attention . Do you see all this structure? This show is TVP's biggest investment this year. We translated the original scripts in detail. Who's the only Brazilian director with original American scripts today? I am . This is my big break, and you won't ruin it. So, do me a favor and study this script. Look at the camera, read the teleprompter and that's it. The rest you leave to me. Let's rehearse.

Relax. Sancho Panza, pour her a drink. -I don't drink. -But you should . This should not be a convent. For the ratings to go up, we have to be sexy. Please lose this vulgar language in the work place. I don't believe you're that tough . I don't buy it. Let's make a deal. If you show me who you really are, I'll stop swearing . What do you say? I don't think so. Can I ask you something? Let your hair down . Let down your hair. Mr. Olsen asked me to tell you you did well today. You got through to the kids. But he's worried about the script. You can improvise, but pretend you're reading the script. It doesn't make any sense, but the kids like it. This babe is skittish, you have no chance. What do you mean? She bit the hook. To catch a fish like that, you need patience and talent. Especially a religious fish . Watch and learn . And start saving for my 18-year-old whiskey. C'mon, ladies first. Let's play. Son, it's on. Mom, tell me the big news. Mundial called me and invited me to play a Countess in a primetime soap opera . -No... -What's a Countess? It's been 15 years, son . My soap opera was top-rated, everybody stopped me on the streets asking for autographs. ''Look at this hair. It looks like a broomstick diva . So poor. Let's give you a make over so you can get a millionaire, a banker not a bakery owner.'' Bravo! Mrs. Marta is back on TV. From now on, from 9 a .m . to 9 p.m ., the Mendes are on air.

Son, be nice to your grandma . -Am I going to be alone? -No, with your grandma . -I have a work thing . -Again, dad? -It's work. -Can I come? -No. -I can sleep in the car. Forget about it. Come here. Tomorrow is a holiday. -Want to come to work with me? -OK. Yay! What work thing is that? It's an avant-garde performance with two classical ballerinas. Can't we come? Impossible, mom .

What about the ratings, who's first? -Mundial. -Mundial, of course. -What about us? -Third place. We're going to beat Mundial. We're actually worried about not losing third place. This is the problem, Lucia . You look at your own ass instead of looking at the horizon . Tell him to read the subtitles. What's missing for better ratings? Help me think, let's brainstorm together. What do children want most? To laugh? Son, what are you reading? Let me see. BINGO, I LOVE YOU . TALKING TO YOU IS WHAT I WANT MOST IN THE WORLD. Monkey, you've just given me a brilliant idea . Brilliant! Hold this. Why are you drinking from the jug? Sancho, take this. Lucia . What children want most is to interact with their idol. If we do that, the ratings will go through the roof. -Interact how? -I was hoping you'd ask. Letters, those old things. We're in the heat of the 80's. What children need is... To give Bingo a call! And Bingo talks to them live on the phone. I'll talk to Peter Olsen, but he'll think it's risky. No pain, no gain . Tell him that. Son, come here. Give me a kiss. My friend will drop you at mommy's. -Sancho. -C'mon, champ. Weren't we going to the movies? Yeah, but daddy's got... A photo shoot. We might go on Saturday, OK? I'm coming . -Bingo, Bingo! -A hug from the clown! I want all the kids calling the coolest clown in the universe! Mamma Conchetta has one more call for me. Let's see. Hello?

It's a boy now. Bye! One more call. Who's talking? Gabriel, don't you want to call Bingo? No. Let's take one more call. Hello? Bingo, kiss my ass! No, no, no, kid. I never kiss donkeys, their breath is horrible. But if mommy and daddy like to kiss asses that's none of this clown's business! Sit tight. I'll be right back. 4, 3, 2, 1. Commercial break. Thank you . Why is the gringo so happy? Team ! We're second place! Team ! We're going to be first! Hold your horses. Second has exceeded our expectations. Lucia ... Didn't you say this show was your big break? -Why dream small? -''Lulu's Show'' is unbeatable. Wally, what's next? Well, no wonder. I'm cute and all, but how can I beat this blonde? -Take three kids to the stage. -Lucia . If you'd let your hair down wear a thong and walk in there with me we would beat Mundial. You laughed, I saw it! Two minutes! We need pepper, chili pepper. We need pepper. And I have an idea . Lucia ! Lulu is cute, but she's got no ass. Thirty seconds. Bring the game on set! Vasconcelos, zoom in on the Conchetta . Mamma Conchetta, Vasconcelos! I'm sorry. Gretchen ! Gretchen ! -Can I send a kiss? -Speak here. Can I send a kiss? I want to send my niece Lara a kiss! Lara, a kiss from Bingo! Apart from being an excellent dancer and singer, Gretchen is also a family girl. She knows life is hard . Give it up to Gretchen ! Gretchen ! Gretchen ! Gretchen ! Gretchen ! Life's not a joke, huh . Commercial break. I have an announcement. For fuck's sake. The phone company called complaining . They're overloaded . And there's one more thing you won't believe. Spit it out. We've reached first place. We've reached first place! Lucia ! Didn't I tell you? Our goal is the impossible. Right? I'm so glad there was no bet! -How many points ahead? -It varies from 1 to 2. Easy, easy. Let's get back! Let's get back. -Wally! Where's Wally? -He's got ants in his pants. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Bingo, y ou're on. Hi, pals. Bingo is very happy today. Very happy indeed . I want to send a message to two friends. Rog?rio and Armando. Hi Rog?rio, hi Armando. How are you doing? I'm here on TV and I just want to tell y ou that the whole country is watching TVP. So Rog?rio, there's no life outside M undial? It just so happens we've reached first place! Read my lips. FIRST PLACE. First place! -First place! First place! -Are you crazy? First place! First place! First place! Call a commercial break! Repeat a cartoon, I don't care. I told you that one day the silver lady would kiss the sole of my shoe. This is the silver lady. And this is her kissing the sole of my shoe! First place! First place! First place! First place! Bingo is very happy, Bingo's ratings rose, just don't ask Bingo where he puts his nose. First place! Long live the king of the mornings. I got you a present. -What's this? -It's a ticket. -Is it what I think it is? -Have a nice trip. Come in . I'm off. The board complained to me about you teasing Mundial. But they sent you flowers. Have a sit. You know what I deserve today? A date with you . Remember our deal? I stop swearing and you show me the real you . I don't think so. You pick the place. He'll find his way in through the smallest cracks: vanity, lust and greed are open doors to let the devil in . Do y ou understand that? Brother Josias? Sister Rute, sister Lucia? Do you understand? And why are you special? Because y ou are here in this house. Are you OK? I've got a headache. -Hallelujah ! -Hallelujah ! -Hallelujah ! -Hallelujah ! Hallelujah, y ou are special. Are you sure you don't want a sip? Wine is Jesus's blood . As far as I know, you're not a Bible expert. Jesus and I have a lot in common . We are right up there and get straight to the point. Straight to the point? When will you have sex with me? That's what marriage is for. You want me to get married to have sex? What if sex with that person isn't good? Isn't it better to know beforehand? -You only think of petty pleasures. -Who says they're petty? -You've had too much to drink. -What's wrong with that? My pastor says alcohol isn't the problem, but the drunk who thinks he's funny. You really take him seriously? He's got a sense of humor and it's just right. There's no rhythm to his show, he's repetitive. That is not a show. And life is not a stage. Who says so? I won't waste my time explaining the obvious. You really think I drink because a devil on my shoulder tells me to? You really think I'm stupid? If I did, I wouldn't be here. I think you should relax a little. Stop thinking about Jesus and think about what could give you some actual pleasure. For me, Jesus is real. And saying his name gives me great pleasure. Jesus! Jesus! Oh Jesus! Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!

I need a bottle of wine and two crystal glasses. I'm sorry. It's fine, we don't need anything . Wasn't the kiss of death enough for you? I almost died, right? I hope it helps you change your ways. It's easier to empty the sea with a bucket. Do you want help with your bucket? -What are y ou doing here? -Did n't y ou get the subpoena? I want to see my son .

I know y ou're all thinking. ''Easier said than done''. But I've drunk more than all of you here. I know what it means to fight a battle a day. So I would like each of you to tell us the hardest moment of your day. Can you start, Augusto? I miss my mother, my son and the stage. That's all. But why the stage? Because without it, I'm nothing. I can be wherever I want, I can be whoever I want. U nder the spotlight... I can do everything. -Hi. Gabriel Mendes? -Yes. -He's coming . It's the only thing I know how to do. It doesn't matter where. C'mon, Baron . Wherever there is a spotlight, is where my stage is. Shoot him, not me. This person here is Augusto Mendes. A worker at the service of art.
