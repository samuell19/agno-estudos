St. Sebastian. January 1988. Goa, India. St Sebastian's Day. First images of a film a long time in the making on the different representations of martyrdom. Return to Europe. Conceive the film as a journey across Europe. For more than 400 paintings found, choose thirty. Write the movie. Put it to paper. Produce. Iconographic Voyage: the martyrdom of St Sebastian In India, I had found a known image, an image known since childhood. In my memory, the image of this man pierced by arrows offered to suffering. Who was St Sebastian? Why for centuries has he been painted? Why the paintings so different? Why such an ambiguity between suffering and enjoyment? The journey Bologna was to leave in search of these answers Florence looking for different representations of Sebastian. Munich... London. London. London. - National Gallery - Refusal to film the paintings during opening hours. Take a video camera, hide it under one's coat and go to the Crivelli room, 15th century. St Sebastian in Heaven, next to the Virgin. Femininity. Fineness of the pierced skin. Sebastian, Captain of the Praetorian Guard, in the 3rd century, in Rome, under Diocletian. One of the favorites of the Emperor, mad, homosexual, taking himself for God. Diocletian, the last great persecutions and Sebastian had to pay for his faith. To be put to death by the archers, he escaped. Only later was he stoned and then died. Six centuries of painting, no stoning. Always the arrows. Always differently. Honthorst, 17th. Like a wounded bird. It's nice to have a little curve there. Return to Brussels. Filming in the studio. Take the time for a different look. Get closer to the skin. Follow with the camera the movements of the painting. Filming painting is is to look at a way of painting, but also a way of staging. It is Crivelli who gives to St Sebastian his arrows to pose next to the Virgin in Paradise. While we know that he has not been tortured to death. It is St Francis who looks at the baby Jesus, who is watching the Virgin, who is looking at Sebastian, who looks at no one. Another painting. Another body. Giovanni di Paolo, 15th century. Because of restoration, impossible to see in London. St Sebastian had resisted the arrows of torture. The great plagues of Europe, killing since the Middle Ages millions, were the punishment, the arrows of God. And Sebastian had become the great saint against plagues. Precision in the veins along the hand. Absence of sex under the draped end of fabric. Brussels, Sablon neighbourhood. Before leaving for France, I find the trace of a St Sebastian for sale at an art dealer. Maes, Belgian artist, 19th. The arrows that pierce the body... the representation as a whole... A kind of enjoyment almost... Camera in hand, I film the body differently. ... look at the painting now... ... the broken arrow in the arm. There is an artery that has been hit, however there's no blood. May 1988. Motorway. Leaving the city. Michel. Friend. Painter. First assistant on the film. A feeling of rediscovering light, clouds, air, wind. Paris. Orsay Museum. Finding the strange atmosphere of Ribot's painting where Sebastian is cared for by two monks after the torture. Monks never represented elsewhere. What exactly are they doing in the darkness? Go to the former house of Gustave Moreau. Search among the 7,000 sketches spread throughout the floors. At the back of the display units, end up finding the sketch of a male Sebastian, then further on, his feminine double. Louvre Museum. Go and look for the feminine image and the male image of the Saint. Raise one's eyes. Raise one's eyes towards the body of Perugino.

St Sebastian attached to a world in ruins. Memling. Darkness. Room of the Flemish Primitives. The day rises on the triptych of Memling. Open book where St Sebastian and Christ become one. The sacrifice. The resurrection. The ascension. Memling, Bruges, 15th. At the saint's feet, a modern jacket from a surrealist painting. Leave Paris. Leave Michel. I find Charlotte, my daughter and Didier. Didier's house. Find the origin of the film. Indian music, where I filmed the first images, the first emotion. Excitement of returning here, to the room that gave birth to the desire for the film. The skin and the look. Say or don't say that. Keep the secret. But let's say starting from there, there was the desire to tell a story, to seek the space between suffering and enjoyment, to understand how this has been shown throughout the centuries. Find the book that started the film and from there set off again towards sensuality, to the paintings' skin. We have the feeling of sinking into the painting. A hand that has turned to the sky and a hand that has turned to the earth. I really like the two gazes. The two heads are facing each other. The two men of Light. Then I really like... Rouen. Nicolas Regnier. The path of the hand. We see the vertical traces of the brush. And I find it always moving to meet this trace. Other skin, other paint. I try to find the trace of the brush on the body of Christ. Caravaggio. Giordano. Regnier. Brittany. End of the European continent. Western end of the trip. The museum is unfortunately here. Perhaps all the saints we have, and God only knows we have enough in the museum, were no help in the least in the face of the hurricane of October 16th. Which still ripped off our roof and caused some damage inside. Brest. Couldn't find the picture sought. Museum destroyed by the storm. Tours. June 10th. Games between the filmed image and the painted image. Little girl filmed facing the image of the son, cared for by his mother. Cairo. Francesco Cairo. The master of mouths half-open. Tours. Train station. An accordionist plays La Paloma. Charlotte returns to Brussels with her mother. Car. Alone. July. Summer light. Théophile Bigot. All day I film his painting. In the middle of the museum room, the video camera films my approach, the comings and goings of visitors. Museum space. Space of a look. Curator's letter in which he asks me what I want to film. The answer is in the colour photocopies that adorn the letter. She, Irene. The wound. And he, Sebastian. Repeat the same frames. Scene of an extraordinary concentration. Try to understand what is happening. Cemetery opposite St Bruno church. Rain. Burial. Above the parish notice boards, appears the body of a St Sebastian. Road to the south. Former pilgrimage route. Crossing the yellow of Van Gogh's sunflowers, leaving the soft tones of the Flemish primitives to go meet the ochres and blues of the Spanish. Something of an initiatory journey in these kilometers traveled. Parking all along the road to North Africa. For a year, not having had time to take his daughter in his arms. I steal these images of tenderness. Madrid. Prado. Breakdown. Breakdown in the film with the Prado that remains closed. Yet, it may be the most human, the most naked of the St Sebastians I wanted to film. The body deformed by El Greco's pain. On the head of the statue of Velasquez, children play. Spain. Nowhere in Europe is the image so sacred. Body of Christ publicly displayed in the cathedral. Devotion of women. Religion of touch, blood, skin. In these kisses, find those of Goa embracing the image of the saint brought by the Portuguese Jesuits 450 years ago. There remains the fascination of the flesh. There as here, the emotion in finding a living image. The great saint against plagues, the holy physician. End of July. Go up the painters' road which in the 16th and 17th centuries went down to Italy. Highway of the sun. Image of a pump attendant out of a Crivelli painting filmed a few months ago in London. Urgency. Sudden opportunity to go to Italy to try to find a painting. You can take photos without flash, without tripod. Voice of Adriana telephoning the museums of Italy. Break in the journey. Plane. The Alps flattened by altitude. I lose the painters' route. I see neither colours nor perspective. Naples. August 1988. Police investigation. Search the city for a painting by Forli. A St Sebastian somewhere in the city. A number? What is it? An extension? I understand. St Sebastian. Alone, far from God. Looking down. The gaping wound that invades the picture. We will search all the museums, all the archives. Without success. Rome. To find the most famous St. Sebastian, perhaps the most sensual. Capitolini Museum. Basilica of San Sebastian. The Bernini recumbent. Enjoyment offered. Adriana, fascinated, remains to watch. Photograph of this moment. Perugia. August 15th. Find Lorenzo's St Sebastian, face attacked by time.

Return to this question: Why the film? Why St Sebastian? Journey around 1,000 different ways to show a man that we haven't known and have imagined 1,000 different ways.

Middle Ages. Mainieri. 15th. August 19th. Arrival in Venice From the vaporetto, redo the first traveling shot in the history of cinema. Promio, Lumière's cameraman, 100 years ago, from a gondola, filmed the same houses on the Grand Canal. Ca' d'Oro, Venetian palace represented in a miniature painted by da Verona in the 16th century. At that time, young women were leaning over the balcony. Today, four centuries later, the same balcony without the little ladies. But inside, smiling beneath the pain, Mantegna's St Sebastian. Image of a religion based on blood, built on the border between suffering and enjoyment. March 25, 1905. Beijing. Fu-zhu-li, guilty of murdering the person of a prince, is condemned to be dissected alive. Santa Maria Salute Church. Titian. Piombo, who looks with disdain at the rope that connects him to the order of the world. We are forbidden because of restoration. We leave without seeing the colours. End of August. Milan Station. Train to northern Europe. Throughout the train journey, portraits of imaginary St Sebastians. Filming men who could have posed for the painters whose paintings I filmed. Because we know nothing about him, everything was possible. For Christ, the age, the face were known to painters from texts, from the shroud. 15 centuries of painting and 100 years of cinema have represented the same Christ. But Sebastian, we know only the beauty of the young captain, as the ambiguous ties with the Emperor. And with no original image, all images have been possible. Paris. School of Saint-Louis de Gonzague. Remembering long masses in Latin. Look back. Believe. Believe as we have been led to believe that when one bites on a host the blood of Christ squirts in your mouth. Do it one day and realize that nothing happens.

Sebastian's preparation for the torment. Provocative pause. Instant rarely staged. Self-portrait of van Dyck. He is 22 years old and still works in Rubens' studio, which he parodies. Munich-Brussels train. Autumn light. Return. Of the people who accompanied me during the trip, Luc is perhaps the farthest from cinema, but he's the one I film the most because I sense the pleasure of being filmed, to be recognized by the camera, to be complicit in the film. Brussels Airport. Above, a covering of clouds. Final trip with Michel to the east. East Germany. Dresden. November 26th. 18:00.

Find the surface of the skin. The skin as first and last trace of the sacred. The film: looking for images produced on Sebastian over time by the imagination of painters. The film, after a long migration, has refound its own story, that of the return to the sacred. In the Middle Ages, painters represented the fear of the plague, the fear and the respect of God that I knew in my childhood. Later, of the sacrificial body, the intoxication of pain, remained only the beauty of the body, the drunkenness of the body offered to the viewer. Parallel course between the evolution of painting and the journey of my past. From the sacred to the profane. From the fear of God to the enjoyment of the human being in what is most human, and most profound... Skin. Subtitles: corvusalbus
