I can't see over the ledge here. Get the whole rainbow, look at it! That's the beginning of the rainbow. - Oh my God, this is so cool! This is the weirdest thing. Oh my God, this is beautiful! - The beginning of two rainbows. Oh my God! I can't believe this! - I don't know what it means. This is so cool! What? What is it? We're in the rainbow! What is it? What does it mean? This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. So weird. It's moving with us. - I know. Here it is! We gonna drive through it. Here it comes! - Here it comes! Come on in. See me from within. In this vast land of a hundred muscles, tissues, bones and cartilage, push and blow and twist and tremble, in an awe-inspiring effort, with firmness and delicacy, with the utmost attention to the tiniest detail, neatly timed and orchestrated, break out into the world for just a split second to say something, to be heard by someone, to reach beyond the tissues, bones, cartilage, to exist outside themselves, outside of flesh and blood and biology, to tell, to formulate, to make sense. Come on in. See me from within. This is where I am born. From here I go out into the world. My friend. My friend. Try it again? My friend. My friend. In the vowel, there's a difference, right? Yes, exactly. For the first one, the tongue was a bit more in the front, and for the second it went a bit more down, and you had a higher, or bigger space in the back of your mouth, reaching towards the pharynx. Maybe you can try an "S". And a "SH". Start with a "S". And then take the tongue slightly back. You see that the tongue moved a bit backwards. In Iraq, and especially in Baghdad, the civil war started in 2005, two years after the fall of Saddam's regime, or, let's say, after the occupation, the American occupation. At that time, all the minorities, the Christians, the Sabi, the Yezidi, and the other even smaller minorities, were already few. Some of them emigrated, some ran away, some to the north, some to Europe. It depends. Only the Shiites and the Sunnis were left. I didn't know what the difference was between the two. Until I was 20 I couldn't tell who the Sunnis and the Shiites were, because most families were mixed. And in Iraq we have a tribal order. That's your group belonging. And some of the tribes are mixed, they are both Sunni and Shiite. And the killing started. Five guys gather, take a car and set up a checkpoint. There were also ethnic militias. They also kidnapped and killed. There were militias on both sides. We had a friend, Muhannad, a student at the art school. Muhannad was Sunni and lived beyond the Al-Karkh neighbourhood. There were always Shiite checkpoints to go in and out Al-Karkh. We tried to teach him a word. This word is like a code, or a lingual sign, that can save you from... save you from death. Because if you don't pronounce it right you'd be dead. You'd be gone. And this word, we told him: "Muhannad, when you get to the checkpoint, "say 'El-Eziz' [my friend]". But Muhannad said "Al-Aziz" [my friend]. We said: "Muhannad, not "'al-Aziz', 'el-Eziz'! "El-Eziz." Muhannad could not pronounce this word. We tried many times and he kept hearing "al-Aziz", while in fact it's "el-Eziz". I can understand, it's difficult. The difference between "al-Aziz" and "el-Eziz" is... So how do you pronounce an H? Well, an H is made in your throat, with your vocal folds approximating. Now, you can't see this sound being made None of the other articulators come together. But you can feel it. If you hold your hand about a centimetre, or maybe an inch away from your mouth as you make this sound, you should feel a silent warm breath hitting the palm of your hand. Good. Once more. The human head is a remarkable resonator which can change tone at will by moving the tongue and the jaw. Can you make an "A" again? The first time I received a larynx massage was a very special experience. I still find it special, because that's the only moment where so much physical attention is paid to this area of my body, and it feels very fragile and also very intimate. I was not aware of the vulnerability and intimacy of that area until now. And through my physical transition, I have discovered that I identify very much with my voice. Of all changes, this one is actually the only one that touches me deeply. When my larynx is between your hands, I feel as if my whole life is in your hands. Really. I think I've always felt like a boy, but... I never felt that my female body and my feminine expression were in contradiction to that. But the rest of humanity does think so. And for many years I've been fruitlessly communicating to my environment that my pronouns were "he", "him" and "his". And yes, that didn't work. People did not understand that, or could not accept it. And I think that only then I got gender dysphoria, because I saw I failed to communicate it. And my voice, people have told me a number of times that it betrays me, that my voice betrays me. And I became extremely aware of my giggling and the high pitch of my voice. You get the feeling that society is full of customs officers, walking around, constantly holding border controls. And that physical features such as high or low voice, are the necessary documents to be allowed into one or another territory. When sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act like a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colours. These take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colours. These take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. I'm recording this for the Visual Accent Dialects Archive. I grew up in the south-west of Lithuania, northern Europe. When I was 19 I moved to Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, and I lived there for three years. This dialect donor is from Chile and has lived in the United States for three years. She's spoken English since she was five years old. I have two paragraphs I'm going to have you read that have all the sounds of the English dialect in them, and you can just read those out loud. Take your time. Shall I do the rainbow passage first? - Yes, that'd be great. When sunlight strikes raindrops in the air... They act as a prism and form a rainbow. This is the female recording, normal vocal effort. When sunlight strikes raindrops in the air. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colours. Into many beautiful colours. These take the shape of a long round arc. Arch. With its path high above its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. People look, but no one ever finds it. My name "Mark Phelan" identifies me as Irish. Well, my surname does for “Mark” is a deliberately neutral name, chosen by my parents because "Phelan" marks me as someone from the Catholic-Nationalist community of Northern Ireland. Phelan isn't a common name so invariably I have to spell it out over the phone. And if the person on the other end of the phone is a Protestant and they repeat my name to me, spelling it out: P, "aitch", E, L, A, N... It sounds to me that they're correcting my pronunciation, not confirming they’ve spelt it correctly. Maybe that is what they are doing, but sometimes it’s obvious it’s more than that. And so sometimes, I’ll also spell it out again, careful to emphasise the "H". P, "haitch", E, L, A, N. Now, this all sounds, literally and figuratively, innocuous. But for me, it’s an invisible, personal and political tussle over identity. I know what’s actually being said. They know what's actually being said. We’re both asserting our identity in the act of spelling out my name. At least, that’s how it feels to me. But these silly things can matter. Sometimes they’re serious, as I know from my own experience of when as a kid, walking my aunty’s dog, Conie, in the Waterworks Park in North Belfast. It's an area of the city that’s a patchwork quilt of Catholic-Nationalist areas alongside Protestant-Unionist areas, and where most of the killings of the conflict took place, partially, perhaps, because of this proximity of both communities. As I walked around the lower lake, I was who I am: Mark Phelan. I lived in Salisbury Avenue. I went to the Our Lady of Lourdes Primary School and the Catholic Church of the Resurrection on Cavehill Road. But in the northern part of the Waterworks when walking near the Westland Protestant estate, I called myself Mark Paisley, I lived in Henderson Avenue, went to mostly Protestant BRA primary school and the Methodist Church on the Cavehill Road. I used to walk round that park rehearsing both identities, just in case I was stopped by older gangs of boys. Though usually, nothing ever happened, and only once was I asked my name. But I was ready for it, because one sunny day in the Waterworks when I was about ten, I was punched in the face by some older boys from the Westland estate, which was protestant. The boy who hit me later became a notorious loyalist thug in the local paramilitaries, who went on to kill a young man, who was a good friend of mine, someone I’d admired for his grace and beauty. And the man who killed him, was once the boy who asked me to say the eighth letter of the alphabet. And who hit me, hard, when I said "haitch". Human speech, seemingly so simple, is a very complicated process no one fully understands. We're interested in finding better ways of describing complicated sounds, like speech. Born from air, invisible. Wind blowing through creeks and tunnels, swirling in caves, gliding over hills, caressing an ever-changing topography, again and again, repeating the same path, becoming sound, becoming words, becoming language. Forgetting other possibilities. Forgotten possibilities become foreign sounds, foreign words, foreign languages. Unpractised topographies become other territories, unexplored, exotic, hostile. Crossing is not guaranteed. Every sound is a potential checkpoint. Crossing is not guaranteed. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. You can use your fingers for help. And the tongue... You can see you always put the tongue against the teeth. It shouldn't touch the teeth. Can you hold your jaw still? It still moves together. It's only the tongue that participates. Do this again... I come from Ghent and you hear it very well in my "R". I notice that people always recognize me as a Ghent-man from the way I pronounce "R". It is something we carry from the past, from a long time ago, when we were dominated by the French Bourgeoisie. There was an occupation. The people of Ghent couldn't speak their own language for a long time. I want to become an actor and it'd be difficult for me to get roles if I'm always identified by my language. They will always say: "This guy is from Ghent and you hear it in his speech." It's also the case if you want to... to be voice actor, or do radio. You must be able to speak pure general Dutch. So, when doing the tongue-tip R, it's important that the tongue-tip touches the alveolar ridge and the airflow makes the tongue-tip vibrate. Then, put the tongue in the position of the D. Then keep the sound continuous. Don't change your posture. While doing that, you put the Q-tip in the middle of your tongue, the opposite side, the bottom of your tongue, and you add vibration there. And feel your tongue flapping. Even look at your mouth in the mirror. When sound wave strikes the membrane, it makes thousands of microscopic movements per second. Only by computer could they be calculated, and for the first time pictorially described. It takes several minutes of this motion to draw the simple sound of "Yes". We're at 62%, 80... 90... That's it. Thanks. She sells sea shells on the sea shore. The sticky taste of salt on her twisted tongue. She closes her eyes and opens her mouth. In a split second she is crossing the distance between "SH" and "S", between sea and shore, between "stop" and "go", between "yes, you are" and "no, you're not". Eight hours per day I was only a voice. This voice was mine, but I was someone else. I didn’t speak my language, my tone was mature and confident, and I had a different name. For 8 hours per day I was called Daniela Feritti. I was working in a call center and the first requirement of the job was to forget who I was and become a different person. A trustful, reliable person, certainly not Albanian. My voice was my only tool. In order to sound as Daniela Feritti, I had to imagine her. I imagined a 24 years old woman with a degree in finance. She was wearing a suit, with fancy hair and make up and had her own office with a computer and two or three screens. She was everything I wasn't in my daily life. I was a high school student in my homeland Albania, struggling to ease the burden of my parents and secure some kind of future for myself, employed as a cheap labor force by some fishy foreign company. Eight hours a day, I hid my origins because of the reputation it carries, but as this meant cheating, I was contributing to this reputation at the same time. Daniela Feritti was speaking German. Because her job consisted of calling people in German-speaking countries, trying to sell them fraudulent financial services. Like myself, she didn't speak in her mother tongue. She was Italian who learnt German from friends and mostly in informal circumstances. This was a clever trick which explained her eventual mistakes, wrong pronunciation and other linguistic pitfalls, that otherwise would have exposed her as an impostor. Talking in German and trying to sound like one required a lot of physical effort... and I was stretching my mouth and jaw muscles all the time. Towards the end of the day I would usually get so tired that I couldn't pronounce harsh German sounds anymore. Please repeat the sentences. It's springtime. Now the trees are in bloom. Losing everything: home, roots, rights. Owning nothing but the body. Becoming nothing but a body. Carrying under the tongue a lost home, lost roots, lost rights. A treasure hidden between teeth, protected behind clipped lips, held in by a hundred muscles, becoming everything. Hello, can I give you a reference number please? Yes. A for alpha, 8, 1, 8, 7 0,3,2. 0,3,2. Yes, that's correct, you can pass the headset to the interviewee. Yes, I switched the speaker phone, so the applicant is ready when you are. Yes. OK, that sounds ready. You can just start. Say hello. Hello. Hello. Please raise your voice, we have a problem. So speak loudly. We'll do what's called a dialect analysis. This means you have to speak in your usual dialect, like you speak at home with your family and friends. Talk about any subject you wish. It's very important not to mention your name, nor names of family members or acquaintances, nor details regarding your asylum request. This is not an interrogation. - Who are you? OK. - It's not an interrogation, the details don't interest us. Nobody gives attention to what you say. We're interested in your dialect, because this recording will be sent to a dialects expert. The expert will examine your dialect, and will determine whether it fits the place you come from. So speak in your dialect. Don't be influenced by my dialect and don't talk in classical Arabic. This is not an interrogation. You have to speak for 15 to 20 minutes. Speak about general things, like your youth, your family, your studies, your tradition, your everyday life, holidays, whatever comes to mind, OK? Yes, fine. When I was 15, I escaped Tibet for Nepal. I stayed in Nepal one year and a half. Then I came to Switzerland and asked for asylum. In two and a half years, I had two interviews and the 3rd one was a language test. I got the invitation letter ten days beforehand. I went there, I entered that place. It was a big hall with many people waiting, and then a policeman came to me, maybe a guard, and called my name. He said that I had to go, that I had to go to another room, so I went with him. And in the room there was a big table. A big table like this. Like this, a big table. In front there was a square window, from which you could see people passing by and buses. By the window stood the table, with a computer on it, a chair underneath and headphones on the side, one chair and on the left side, a table with chairs. A chair like this. And I sat down like this. Then he gave me headphones. Like this. And I put them on. And then, the lady, by phone, started the interview. She introduced herself. Her Tibetan was like the one I speak now. It was a Lassa dialect, but of someone who had been abroad for 2 to 3 years. From her style of talking, I felt it was going to be tough. Before I came to the interview, I felt confident. I knew they were going to ask about my home and my language. So there was no reason to be afraid or worried. I was confident. But once there, the questions were general and some were tricky. When she asked a question and I was thinking of what to reply, she would pass it and move to the next question. And she spoke very fast. And then, she asked in Chinese and I had to answer in Tibetan. And when she spoke Tibetan I had to answer in Chinese. I was not that good at Chinese as she expected. She thought Tibetans from China must know Chinese. This isn't really so. Not everyone in Tibet can speak Chinese. Then she asked me to speak English. So I did, because I learned English in Lassa, and I liked listening to English songs. And in Nepal I learned Nepali and English too. And also on Youtube. Then I arrived in Switzerland, I stayed with foreigners for 7 months, speaking only English, so it had improved. And she didn't expect this level of English, so she had doubts. How can a Tibetan speak English so well? This is what she thought. Three months later I received the decision. Three months later I got an answer. Unfortunately not a good one. They had doubts if I have really come from Tibet. So I feel that my beloved mother tongue or father tongue becomes like a weapon against me. Against my future. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colours. These take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There's according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Each colour in the spectrum has its own individual wavelength, just as each note on the piano has its own sound, or wavelength. However, you can't play all the notes on the piano at the same time and arrive at anything. OK, so... The first time I saw a rainbow, I don't remember how old I was. I was little, that I remember, but I do know that the month was June, and it had rained so heavily. One part of our drying line had come down. I used to be very scared of rain. Now I'm just... moderately displeased, when it's raining. When I was little I was... very scared. You told me that this is a recording from someone from Ghana. That's also how it works in our case work that we get a recording and there is at least a claim where somebody comes from. We don't have to start from nothing. We know what the claim is and then the question to me is: "Is there a support in this recording for that claimed origin?" Maybe she has been lying to you, or you're trying to test me. I have to check if that's supported linguistically. OK, so... The first time I saw a rainbow... There's a nice example already. She says, "So, the first time I saw a rainbow", and the way she pronounces "first" sounds like "fest", which is... also what they do in Ghana. Here. The "fest" time. I don't remember how old I was. I was little. I was little. She says the L at the end. In other parts of Africa, they might say "litu" or "lito". So they wouldn't vocalise the L. You wouldn't hear the L at the end. But people from Ghana do have the L at the end. I was little, that I remember, but... But... Here's a nice occurrence of the vowel in "but" which is a difficult vowel for any non-native speaker of English. So the Dutch get this wrong all the time as well. So the only important question for the first instance of an asylum case is whether the claimed origin is supported or not. And if it's credible, that would be good for the application. If it's not credible, then there are doubts about the whole story. So, in principle, the primary issue is whether the claimed origin is true or not, and it doesn't really matter if we can establish what the true origin is. You can try to imitate another accent, and that happens sometimes, and that's one of the reasons why we want an interview to last for 45 minutes, because it is quite hard to keep it up for that long. And you would probably also find that it is either too exaggerated, inconsistent, but... I don't know, maybe we have been fooled sometimes and we don't know it. It's possible. Could it be the opposite, also? That you took the wrong... not decision, but the wrong... - Conclusion? Well, it could be that the evidence... The evidence that we would expect if the claimed origin was true is just not there, for some reason, and that's what we'll have to report, that there's nothing supporting what's claimed. So, for instance, if we would expect a local dialect and it's just not there, then what does that mean? That depends on whether everyone really speaks that local dialect. So, it wouldn't mean that our conclusion is wrong, but it's what you take from the conclusion. So, we take the rule of thumb to determine what we would expect, in terms of linguistic evidence. If someone is a real exception to the rule, somehow, then, they don't fit the rule of thumb. It's not so hard to hear whether somebody says "RR" or "R". That's not where the language analyst makes the mistake. It is the conclusions that you draw from it. It is not so hard to hear whether somebody uses a certain word that is connected to a certain area. But it is hard to know whether it is right that people use that word only in that area, or in many other areas, because people have a lot of prejudice about each other's language, etc. And so, people make a lot of mistakes in those judgments. So they are instant, they are very unconscious, they are ubiquitous, but they are also very wrong. And people are very, very sure about these judgements even if they are very, very wrong. Like this? - That's better. Can you make an "A"? It's not working. - No? Go on. We are hired to help people who have to take legal decisions, take better decisions. But it is... There is a conflict of standards there. So, linguists know and understand, that there is a whole variety in which people speak, that there's a lot of variation and diversity. And there is basically no room for diversity in those decisions. And of course, this is... the problem of legal systems, where decisions need to be taken and they are "yes" or "no", and the linguist knows that the evidence very often doesn't... more often than not, doesn't really allow "yes" or "no". Listen to me Say the words and watch my mouth Then, say the word with me. Words are broken into sounds. Sound becomes matter. Rolls in the mouth, glides over the tongue. Pushed and squeezed by a hundred muscles. Clenched between teeth. Tasted. Tested. Collected. Measured. Dissected. Sorted. Put into a drawer. Becomes the drawer. Extracted from the body and turned against that body. Made to betray. Betrays. Becomes a weapon. A hundred muscle army. Can you look again, and turn it so that we get the vertical axis. So what you can see here are the sensors on the upper lip, lower lip. And here are the three we glued to the tongue, the tongue-tip, and here on the back of the tongue. With the articulation we can see how the tongue moves while speaking and how the lip opens and closes depending on the angle of the jaw or move forward when the lips are rounded. The BAMF introduced dialect analysis in September 2017, when refugees come to Germany without a valid passport. This was especially true for... Since September 2017, the BAMF uses automatic analysis tools to determine the origin of refugees. When this system was presented, we only knew that the BAMF wants to make the asylum procedure faster and safer. I then wanted to know more about the system and how it works. So, for example, I used the freedom of information law that allows the request of documents from authorities. So I got the user manual, the instructions and training documents for this system, to see what the BAMF officials and decision makers use when they perform dialect analysis on refugees. When a person arrives to Germany and registers, that is, when they give their fingerprints, in this registration process a language analysis is performed, when one doesn't have a passport, for example. The procedure itself is very simple. The official picks up a telephone and dials 72099, then the number of the BAMF office and the number of the applicant. A picture is then shown to the applicant. The picture can contain everyday scenes. A family with children in front of a house or a dinner scene. And the applicant has to describe it for two minutes. After two minutes there's a beep, the recording is finished and the BAMF official will receive a report that can be added to the asylum file. The system analyses phonemes, meaning, it doesn't care which word is used, it only looks at how speech is formed. For this, the system needs many samples to be trained on how one language differs from another language. And the reliability of the system depends on this training data. When the voice recording is completed and analysed, a note comes by mail, and there are mainly percentages on this note. For example, it says that there's 68% probability the person speaks Turkish, and maybe 14% probability Hebrew, and 5% of languages that could not be identified. But the problem is that the BAMF officials, those who will later decide on the asylum case, have no information or instructions from which point on such a result bears any meaning. The computer results with their decimal numbers convey that they are accurate. And a human might trust the computer more than the asylum seeker in front of him. Because it gives a number which can help justify your decision, by saying the computer said it. And the computer is supposedly objective. Even if we are aware that the results can be wrong, it generates suspicion where there shouldn't be one. If all my stories and documents suggest that I'm from Syria, but the computer claims I'm from Egypt, doubt persists. Much of what we know about voice and speech is stored in the computer's memory. From there we can experiment with more advanced ideas in areas that are still unknown. Let's try to synthesize that sentence. I like my coffee black. Let's see if we can change the stress on "my"? How about on "my" and "black"? I like my coffee black. There is more inflection on it but let's see if we can improve this. I got into linguistics, I think, because I was always a language misfit, growing up. I was born in NY City on the Lower East Side, but I have never had a New York City accent because neither of my parents were New Yorkers. When I was five years old I moved to Jamaica, in the West Indies, and Jamaican Creole is my second language. Patois, as they call it. But when I speak to you normally, like this, my speech has nothing in it of Jamaican, or of New York City. So if I would to be tested, on language, to establish my own origins, the first 25 years of my life, it would be very unlikely to confirm the story I've just told you. Many people will assume that languages stop at an international border, or, perhaps, a provincial border. In fact, in the last 500 years, particularly with European languages, languages have evolved to represent the nation-state. So, German and Dutch is a classic example, moving from the Hook of Holland to Berlin, many hundreds of kilometres. It used to be that there's what we call a dialect continuum: one village to the next will be much the same but with a few differences. Differences of grammar, of accent, of word choice. But the same thing would have been true a few hundred years ago at the border. A Dutch village across the border from a German village, they would have spoken very similarly. In the modern era this has changed because of the identification of language as a symbol of nationality, because of the influence of mass media. So, although this homogenization has happened in Europe, and has entered our consciousness through schooling, we believe that the real language is the one we're taught in school, but when we look at the rest of the world, they're very far behind in this naturalised process of language representing the nation-state. And so, very often it's not true that languages stop at international borders. It's very often the case that language variation within a country can be tremendously varied, tremendously great. And so people speaking differently from what is expected... Well, it all depends on what's expected. P B P B SH S SH S It's so close. Like purple and blue. Like cyan and green. Neighbouring countries on a continuous patch of land. See how in the non-existing distance one sound spills into the other. Movements merge and shift, escaping pens and pixels, crossing regions, bending lines, ignoring walls and fences. Counting a million colours, not two, nor seven, in a magnificent gradience, almost imperceptible. Weightless. Thin as air. Nothing but air. And yet, everything. What I'm trying to see is whether the "D" of "dog", when you make a "D" sound, you first make contact at the top and front of the mouth, and you hear nothing during that time. So, you're going... And you hear nothing. Then when you release the contact, that's when you hear "D". That's exactly what you see here. This is you making the "D" sound but you can't hear it, because it's closed. The tongue is closed. And when you release the tongue, that's exactly what you're seeing here, full contact and then release. And what you can see is that more often the electrodes on the left side of the palette were activated than on the right side of the palette. If you compare these numbers: 38, 44, 29, 39. Here... When I'm asked where I'm from, I say: "From God's vast lands". I'm not a big fan of identity cards and passports and all kinds of institutions that want to own my identity, or to own the land, which actually belong to nobody. Or to everybody. Maybe I inherited this from the Bedouin, or maybe this is what attracted me to them, to Sinai when I was 17 years old. There, I felt at home. And since that day I feel at home wherever I go. This home has nothing... This home has nothing to do with a specific place. This home is inside of me. I started learning Arabic from the Bedouin in Sinai. The dialect of the Tarabin tribe. The Bedouin also introduced me to the music of the Gulf. And I fell in love with it, adopted it, and it adopted me. After years in Sinai and the Gulf my Arabic improved. And as I'm staying in Israel and Palestine, I also learnt the Palestinian dialect. If till now, because of the rivalry between the Israeli and Arab entities, I had to completely separate the two languages, so that no Hebrew words sneak into Arabic. Suddenly I started using Hebrew words in my Arabic, in order to speak the local Arabic, the Arabic spoken by Palestinians living in Israel and Palestine. Arabic mixed with a bit of Hebrew. The story is... is actually a series of stories that lead to a day, where I have to get to the airport, and I'm late. So I take a taxi from Jerusalem. I tell the driver that I'm late. and he says that... He... He suggests that I change taxi. That I take another taxi because he would be stopped at the airport's checkpoint, as always, because he's Palestinian. The taxi company was not Arabic but he was. And that meant that at the entrance of the airport we would be delayed, because he would be checked. He was convinced that when we got to the airport his identity would cause my delay. And we are already out of the city. So I tell him that I don't have time to switch taxis and if he listens to me and does what I say, we will get there on time. So we go through the checkpoint ritual. Upon arriving, you open the window and the security guy, or girl says, "Hi" or "What's up?" or ask "How are you?" So I ask him, "What's the answer?" He is experienced. He drives tourists often to the airport. "I say, 'Shalom'". So I tell him, "No. When they say 'Shalom', "you answer, 'Alan'". and then I ask him to repeat after me. So he does, but says, "Ahlan". I correct him, "It's 'Alan', not 'Ahlan'. "'Alan!'" After several attempts, like you'd do with an actor, we have 23, 25 minutes to get it right, We finally manage the "Alan" as a reply to "Hello", or "How are you?" And the next question is: "Where are you coming from?" So I ask, "What do you reply to 'Where are you coming from?'" "Jerusalem". "No", I tell him, "if they ask you, 'Where are you coming from?', "say, 'And you? Where are you from?'" And I train him without reasoning behind it. We arrive at the airport. I also ask him not to slow down. "Don't slow down. Keep a constant speed till the guard." "Shalom." - "Alan." "Where are you coming from?" - "And you?" A sign of a hand and we go through. When the checkpoint is out of sight, he stops at the side of the road, leans his head on the wheel and starts crying. And he says, "17 years. "For 17 years I've passed this checkpoint "and was always stopped! It's the first time I passed." So, today I'll show you how to make a real rainbow. and all we need is a garden hose. See? On mine here, I have a setting that's called mist. We can select: jet... We can select jet, flat, full, cone... I have one here, it's a little used. It's called mist. And that's what l do. I set it on mist. And then, I put it up here, on the little stick here. And I'm going to create the mist. This mist will create a lot of waterdrops. And then I just have to go behind the sun and look for my rainbow. And as you guys can see here there's a real rainbow. It's not a fake one, this thing is real. Look how pretty. Now... You could say, how do I do a double rainbow? Just go down, and you see, there's a second one there. You can also try to go over to the other side and see if you can... You can see there that it's going all the way through. Can you see it there? I don't know if I can see the second one right now from there. It's not there. So you have to look around a little bit. See? It's going there. Look around. Change your position a little bit, and if you're lucky you find it. Look at that. It has to do with the wind. Look how the wind is pushing the mist away. Then you have to walk on a little bit. Do you see that? How pretty it is? A home-made rainbow. It is so great! And so close to home.
