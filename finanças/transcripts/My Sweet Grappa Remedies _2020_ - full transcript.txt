My Sweet Grappa Remedies Wanna go to the zoo? Yes. This is my diary. Nobody's going to read it. And I won't reread it either. It's just a diary. Goodbye, Kawashima. Goodbye. WEDNESDAY, MARCH 20 I said in my head... "I'm your mom." Kota. Shiitake, shiitake. Don't touch them. They're delicate. Don't touch, don't touch. Let's go. Shiitake are delicate. Don't touch them. I'm no mom. SATURDAY, APRIL 20 REMOVED BICYCLE DEPOSIT They took my bicycle away. SATURDAY, APRIL 27 It's in prison. I finally saw it again after a whole week apart. I felt like hugging it. Be careful from now on. I rang the bell. It sounded happier than usual. The dog said "Welcome back" too. Ringing. Barking. They both end in "G". THURSDAY, MAY 9 I wonder if the woman I see in the mirror is the same that other people see. I've always wondered that, since I was little. Huh? SUNDAY, MAY 26 Thank you. Thank you. He's handing out tissues to women only. I wonder why he didn't give it to me. Thank you. TUESDAY, MAY 28 HYDRANGEAS ARE IN BLOOM. Come visit me. Watching this old lady desperately using a phone with huge text moves me to tears more than any movie. THURSDAY, JUNE 13 On this day I started seriously dating a man for the first time. For some reason, I recall it every year. He's probably married and has kids by now. I remembered you. You must remember me too. Or rather... Remember me, please. MONDAY, JUNE 17 We're already half way through the year. Time flies. One year passes so fast. Half a year's already gone. Most people express regret saying "Half a year has already passed." "One year passes so fast." They see the passing of time as regrettable. That's kind of negative. But I'm living too in a negative, backward way. Ouch! You don't realize it until you bump into something. Soon I'll have to be positive and forward-looking. WEDNESDAY, JUNE 19 - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning, Kawashima. - Good morning. Let's go on pay day. Excuse me. Good morning. I'm going to work here from today. My name is Uchimura, I'm 28. Pleased to meet you. Here you are. There's a new employee at the office. A young man. Listen, everybody. He looks neat. Thank you. Do you have a girlfriend? No. I don't. Wakabayashi asked him. What's your type of girl? I don't dislike her cheekiness. Someone who eats up neatly her chicken wings, I guess. What's that? Thank you. Love is in the air. THURSDAY, JUNE 27 Don't push your luck, you bastard! You, really... With that stupid smile on your face. You keep lying and lying, you bastard. I'm not getting fooled. You're full of shit. There's a middle-aged man growling. You're just lying all the time, aren't you? I spoke to him in silence. Yeah. I can't stand it! Damn it. I know. Don't bullshit me, bastard! - Say something, idiot! - Don't be so angry. I'm listening to you. A beautiful spring day at Sumida River Rowers are going up or floating down Drops Drops from an oar fall like petals How can I describe this beautiful view We're not alone, you know. SATURDAY, JUNE 29 Another typhoon's coming. Lunchtime. I'm drinking red wine. I prefer red to white. For both color and wine. A mosquito on my thigh. You want some wine too, huh? I won't kill you today. FRIDAY, JULY 5 Uchimura hasn't showed up in a week. Doesn't even answer the phone. Are you OK? I'm sorry. I heard the sound of love's curtain dropping down. Thank you so much. You're so nice, Igarashi. MONDAY, JULY 8 I want to go to the seaside. The sea at night. It's pitch black. You can't see a thing. You can only hear the waves. It's the place I can feel death the nearest. Once a year, I go there to check whether I'm still attached to life or not. WEDNESDAY, JULY 10 I don't know why, but I felt really sad. I've never broken a mirror in my life, but I wonder if this is a bad omen too. I'm not demanding to know what will happen. But at least I'd like to know how serious it'll be. THURSDAY, JULY 11 I think my toilet paper's running out faster than usual. There must be someone else using it. SATURDAY, JULY 13 They removed my bicycle again. You come here often. You remove my bike often too. I work here at the deposit. Someone else removes them. If it was me, I wouldn't have removed yours. Do you remember the date it was removed? It's easier to find if you do. This one? Only two days have passed, but it felt like a long time. Can you fill this form? When I tried to ring the bell, it wasn't there. If I have to suffer like this, then I won't ride it anymore. Lady! Lady! If I had kids, I probably wouldn't let them out of the house. SUNDAY, JULY 14 I can't help but thinking about my mom lately. I wonder how it feels like to be called "Mom". I liked to watch her laying the newspaper on the floor and pulling out her grey hair. Sometimes I do the same while thinking about her. This is how newspapers smell. I guess Mom used to sniff this smell too. WEDNESDAY, JULY 17 The footbridge close to my house. I realized I've never used it. The view from the footbridge I've never used before was totally new to me. I feel like crying. THURSDAY, JULY 18 I need a change. So, I decided to take the train that goes the opposite way I usually go. Nothing but regret. Give me my time back. Is this a change, too? FRIDAY, JULY 19 You know... I'll call you "Sempai" from now on. Because you're my senior at work. What was that announcement for? "Sempai"... Is this a change, too? SATURDAY, JULY 20 SATURDAY, JULY 20 Today it's one of my very few friends' birthday. Today it's one of my very few friends' birthday. TO: MAYUMI KOMORI HAPPY BIRTHDAY When I sent her my wishes, my e-mail bounced. "Looks like she changed her address." But, I'll write you again next year. Because you're still a dear, irreplaceable friend to me. SUNDAY, JULY 21 It's here! It's here! Hello. Could you wait a moment, please? Sorry. This way, please. I've bought a bed. I don't think I'd feel embarrassed if someone spied me taking a bath. But, I didn't know... Sorry. that having a new bed delivered to my room would be so embarrassing. I'm sorry. MONDAY, JULY 22 When I woke up, I was sleeping on the floor between my bed and the window. This is a change, too. That e-mail thing the other day is really bothering me now. Why didn't she tell me she changed her e-mail address? I'll sleep. THURSDAY, JULY 25 Cheers! THURSDAY, JULY 25 Finally, our long-awaited pay day has come. Yeah. - I've got a question for you! - What is it? What month is my favorite pay day? Is it a riddle? No hints. July? Huh? Why? Because we get a bonus. Boo! Wrong answer. I don't know. The answer is... March! March 25. Why? Because February has only 28 days. So it feels like March's pay day comes really early. Sometimes the 25th falls on a Sunday, right? Then, pay day will be on March 23! Super early! I see. I'll pay attention to that from now on. Next year, March 25 will be... Wednesday. And the next year... Do you come here often? I found it recently. The waiter's a hunk. A hunk? Repeat after me: hunk. Hunk. Hunk. Cheers! Here you go. Caesar salad and spicy cod. So cute. I'm always looking forward to the 25th. Not because it's pay day. Hunk. But because Wakabayashi invites me for a drink. I appreciate it. He's so cute! FRIDAY, AUGUST 30 Let's fall in love. It's such a meaningless decision. I want to stop thinking like that from today. SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 1 ORGAN DONOR CARD SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 1 If they give one of my organs to someone else, I'm worried that it might bring them bad luck. But the idea that a part of me will keep on living outside my body is quite mystical. If you'll ever be inside someone else's body I hope they'll let you drink alcohol. THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 5 It's not there. I can't find it. This isn't it. I lost one of my favorite earrings. I see. I won't look for you anymore. I'll respect your will. SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 7 Hello. This, please. I left the house to get some sake. There was the local festival. That girl in yukata and that boy walking awkwardly in geta clogs were so cute. Become one flesh tonight. You can't truly know your partner if you don't have sex together. SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 8 Mom! What must I do now that I can't have kids anymore? Mom! "Mom", huh? It'd make me laugh every time they called me like that. WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 11 My birthday. I'm one year older now. What is age, I wonder? I always ask myself. At this age, it only makes me embarrassed when they guess how old I am. Would I think differently if I were young? I guess I would. I guess I would. I bet. THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12 I can't believe it. I despise you. Was it really yesterday? Yeah. Why didn't you tell me? I can't even see why you chose not to tell me. At lunchtime, I told Wakabayashi it was my birthday yesterday. I'm sorry. She got really pissed off. I could have organized so many things yesterday. I didn't want you to feel obliged. That's why I didn't tell you. I'm really sorry. I should have told you. Wakabayashi? Please don't ignore me. Waka... ba... yashi. Let me celebrate it properly next year. Yes. Please, do. This is on me. But I'm really pissed off. I think I've never been so happy to get scolded in my life. The day after my birthday, she asked me when my birthday was. She must have amazing intuition. I think she must be an angel reincarnated or something. You're copying me. FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 20 Heavy rain since the early morning. I'm wearing my new shoes to go to work. In all situations, it's better to go through the bad experiences as soon as possible. There. MONDAY, OCTOBER 7 I'm sorry. Kawashima, you're kind of dirty-minded, huh? Here's the illustration of a kidney. Oh? This isn't it. What's this? - The vagina. - Is it really? And this? I'll look at you with dirty-minded eyes from tomorrow. FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 1 For you. For you. I started seeking for something fancy to do while commuting. FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 8 Wakabayashi is home with the flu. It made me suddenly wonder how many people would come visit me if I was hospitalized. I couldn't think of anyone but Wakabayashi. I need a drink tonight. Spending the night with a guy who chatted me up at a bar. Haven't done it in ages. He's 56. People seek me when I don't ask for it. It's always been like this. MONDAY, NOVEMBER 11 If I think he's waiting beyond the crossing, it's not so painful to wait for the train to pass. I kept thinking that for over 20 years. Maybe it is a bit painful. THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 14 Morning. Morning. - Are you OK now? - I'm completely fine. I'm back. 'Morning. I finally saw Wakabayashi after so long. - Good morning! - Are you well now? I'm fully recovered. Good. Did you miss me? Of course I did. Maybe not? I didn't. You're lying. I'll smell your scalp if you don't tell me the truth. No! No! It made me feel like crying even more than any tear-jerker. FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 15 I don't know his name, but I've seen him somewhere. He bowed at me. I bowed back. I used not to bow first to anyone. It makes me feel nostalgic to think about that now. SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 17 SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 17 It's not like I want to move or anything. I was just looking at the ads on a real estate agent's window. 11 minutes from Fujidaira Station. Why is it so expensive? I should have invited him for a drink. THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 21 THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 21 What's the big deal about Beaujolais? What's the big deal about Beaujolais? Hello. I keep saying that, but then I drink it anyway. Let's meet again next year. I'll be waiting for you. Don't tell anyone. I'll be waiting. TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 26 The best way to carry your new wallet. Like this. Right. Shogun style. What? Indian style. What's that? Namaste. Come on, Yoshiko. I'll try too. Wow! How am I doing? Amazing. But we're gonna eat Japanese soba noodles. Maybe I'll get curry soba. Oh? Okamoto? Wakabayashi. - Long time no see. - Indeed. Are you really working? I never see you. Don't worry, I'm working. Really? He was my junior in college. Right. Hello. She's Kawashima, my senior. I saw you the other day. He's the young guy I met the other day. Hello, what would you like? - You? - Zaru soba. One zaru soba and one tengu soba. One zaru, one tengu. Why don't we all go out to eat together next time? I'm good. What does it mean? You're good to go or not? I'm good as in "Good." Be clear! I meant "Good, it's OK." So you're coming? Yes, I'll go. Of course. - You will? - I will. I meant "Let's go." - So you're coming. - Yes, I am. - Really? - Really for real. Really for real. Seriously. What are you eating? Okame soba. Okame soba. - Okame? - Yes. What's it like? Okamoto. He knows Wakabayashi. The three of us going out together. I wonder if it'll really happen. GOOD WEATHER TOMORROW! REALLY? GREAT! LOOKING FORWARD TO IT FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 29 FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 29 It looks almost like she's encrypting her words. She used so many hearts. MONDAY, DECEMBER 2 MONDAY, DECEMBER 2 Say "Cheese." MONDAY, DECEMBER 2 - Okamoto! - Yeah? What's up? It did happen. Earlier than expected. Ready? Go! Smile, Mr. Raccoon Dog. Come this way. I'll take one from here. When I was a senior you were a freshman, right? Yes, I was. He's more than 20 years younger than me. My only relief is that his Chinese zodiac sign must be stronger than mine. Your glass is empty. Excuse me! Thank you. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5 THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5 I wore my brand new shoes to work. I wore my brand new shoes to work. I hate it when I put all my weight on my toes while the traffic light is still red. There's no need to rush. My first message exchange with Okamoto. Does it make you happy to receive a message full of hearts? I asked him. I FEEL REVITALIZED He's an interesting guy. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 7 It's annoying. I fall in love way too easily. I'll sleep. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 12 Hello. Is everything OK? Yes, sorry. I didn't mean to shout, but I did. I can still shout like that. WHEN I'LL BE MIDDLE-AGED Wakabayashi took me to karaoke. MONDAY, DECEMBER 16 Wakabayashi took me to karaoke. MONDAY, DECEMBER 16 "When I'll be middle-aged". A very beautiful song. TUESDAY, DECEMBER 17 There you are. My missing earring is back. When these things happen, I make a point of accepting them Welcome back. without asking too many questions. Welcome back. Cheers. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 20 FRIDAY, DECEMBER 20 I went out on my bike after a long while. I've got the feeling my black and white days have found some color. MONDAY, DECEMBER 23 Bingo at the joint year-end party with the editing dept. - No luck. - Nope! Oh! You've got it! And now the fifth draw. If you punched out a full row, shout "Bingo!". The first winner gets a $500 travel coupon! Ready? Please! Please! Please! G-51! Wot?! Anyone? I had a full row, but I was too embarrassed to say it. Any bingo? Oh? Wait a minute. Have you won? - I haven't. - Let me see! Let me see! Maybe it's a bingo! Maybe it's a bingo! "Maybe" won't do. Just come and check. You'll see. Right? Come on, Sempai. Look. Congratulations! It's the rule. Please say it. Bingo. Congratulations! Yay! Yay! $500 TRAVEL COUPON Congratulations. Amazing! Amazing! MONDAY, JANUARY 6 It was supposed to be the first day back at work, but I woke up at 3pm. It's never happened before. Maybe my body is refusing to go back to the usual routine. I can't see. 68 calls. Wakabayashi called me 68 times. It made me smile. I'm alive. I'm going for a drive with Okamoto and Wakabayashi. SUNDAY, JANUARY 12 Good morning. Morning. - Good morning! - 'Morning. Same color. You have a chemistry. Thank you. How much does it cost? $86 per day. You can rent a car for that money. Thanks for taking the trouble. It was no trouble at all. Wanna put that in the trunk? No, it's OK. Really? What's the cool box for? In case we find some fish. We're not going fishing. Are you planning to swim? Let's put that in the back. It's OK. I'll sit in the front. When she gets into that mood, the best thing to do is to let her be. Let's go, then. Did you spot the sea, down there? Where? - There, between those trees. - I can't see it. No way! Too bad. It was beautiful. What, Okamoto? Do you like classical music? They used to play this tune at my high school, at going-home time. Classy. Oh, isn't it the song that goes... Yes, it is. Maybe next verse. It never starts! Yeah. That's really towards the end. - I think it's coming up. - Really? Is it? Maybe next? - Yes. - You're lying. Here it is! Sorry, I need the toilet. - Again? - You just went. I'm sorry. I need it often. Why did she bring a body board, I wonder? Who knows. These weird performances you do to leave me alone with Okamoto are totally unrequested. I'm fine, don't worry. Sorry for the wait. I pray for your happiness. Let's go! SATURDAY, JANUARY 25 First shrine visit of the year. I know it's a bit late. I've always had this rule to make only short-term wishes. I wish I'll drink tasty alcohol again tonight. The gods are busy too. MONDAY, JANUARY 27 It's not like I'm waiting for your reply. I'm already happy wondering if that's your reply. Phone. Shake. WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 29 Every time I'm interested in someone I get a message from one of my exes. Life is testing me. I'm sure. MONDAY, FEBRUARY 3 MONDAY, FEBRUARY 3 Good morning. Have you got a cold? No, I'm allergic to pollen. I'm sorry for you. I'm not allergic. I'd like to try it once. No, it's definitely better that you don't. - Really? - Yeah. By the way, did you know about this? I've seen it on TV yesterday. If you do this one minute per hour, it's good for your back... What... That was scary. Are you OK? No, it hurts. You're laughing too much. I can't help it. Ouch. I laughed so much my belly hurt. From the early morning. I forgot about my allergy. FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 7 FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 7 If I slept with the guy I loved If I slept with the guy I loved and I found him dead in my bed in the morning, I probably wouldn't be surprised. I'm not drunk today. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 8 The instant our breaths synchronize, I can really feel I'm not alone. WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12 OKAMOTO GOOD EVENING. I was drinking alone when I got a message. From Okamoto. Just accept him. I keep saying that to myself. I'm asking myself in front of the mirror. I don't know why, but I think I got my answer. My other self in the mirror was somewhat nice. MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17 I apologize for the delay. Here's the certificate of lateness. I apologize. Here's the certificate of lateness. Thank you for your cooperation. Here's the certificate of lateness. Here you go. Here. I apologize. I'm happy. Mr. Station Worker. Now, I'm happy. I don't want to record a precise date. Because it'd make it a memory. When something starts, it means that one day it'll surely end. I've started dating Okamoto. TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25 While I was working, I got an e-mail from Wakabayashi, who's sitting diagonally opposite to me. WAKABAYASHI IT'S PAY DAY! BUY HER A PRESENT. WOMEN HAVE A SOFT SPOT FOR GIFTS. Was this really meant for me? She's been doing a lot for me behind the scenes. MAY I TREAT YOU FOR LUNCH? MAY I TREAT YOU FOR LUNCH? It's beyond funny. It moves me to tears. It's beyond funny. It moves me to tears. I'll never forget that expression on her face. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. WE'RE A COUPLE NOW. She was so happy for me that she cried. Sorry I didn't tell you earlier. THURSDAY, MARCH 5 How's "Fresh Blood For The Wolf" doing? It's hard to find a slogan for the bookstore. "Fresh blood" is too strong. Right. Are you hungry? Yes. Shall we go eat? Right. Going home with Okamoto after work. Not bad. But, there are no seats. Let's try somewhere else. I'll ask here. Hello. Sorry, we're full. I see. Thank you. The restaurant he tried to pick was a low-key pub with a unique atmosphere. Shall we try near the station? OK. I love that about him too. What shall we eat? Umm. What do you think? What would you like? SUNDAY, MARCH 8 The clothespin I always use for my laundry looks like a man and a woman kissing while taking each other's hands today. I put it on a thick sweatshirt. Hold it tight. SATURDAY, MARCH 14 I like to queue up behind someone who reminds me of my mother. Mom. I'm right behind you. MONDAY, MARCH 16 MONDAY, MARCH 16 Going back home, I realized I haven't skipped in a while. So I did, in a quiet street. Tell me, was I doing it right? I should have asked him. THURSDAY, MARCH 19 Yesterday it was a month since we started dating. I have to find the courage to write it on the day of our anniversary, one day. SATURDAY, MARCH 21 Kitchen and living room. Okamoto's looking for an apartment. I came along. This window faces West. We went to see a few places. - Nice. - Right? Entering an apartment we don't know whether he's gonna live in or not... It makes my heart ache. This is the balcony. It's got good sunlight. You're lucky. The weather's good today. It's a corner apartment. It's well-ventilated. - And this? - It's a storage room. Air conditioner too. What's wrong? Do you feel unwell? No, I'm fine. Is there something in here? What? Like a spirit, or a ghost? I don't know. Thank god. You look like you can see those things. I've got mixed feelings. It seems that Okamoto prefers old and beautiful buildings over new and beautiful ones. Please contact me as soon as possible. I love that about him too. Sempai! Your Dad's clipping his nails without the newspaper. Here's the newspaper. Thanks. Oh, come on. The water's boiling. I know. Green tea? I had a dream. I was living with Okamoto in the apartment we saw yesterday. I don't know why, but Wakabayashi and Dad were there too. I think it's been a while since the last time I had a dream like this. I wish my mom was there too. It's getting windy. The wind has stopped. FRIDAY, MARCH 27 It's my alarm. It was about 2:35pm. I wonder what that reminder was for. SUNDAY, MARCH 29 I went to the real estate agent with Okamoto. Please sign here. You can move in the 15th of next month. He picked a different apartment from the one in my dream. "I won't let that happen." Someone whispered in my ear. SATURDAY, APRIL 18 SATURDAY, APRIL 18 I'll take that. No, I'm good. I'm helping him move. Shall I hold it from below? I'm fine. I'm fine, really. - Or is it better from above? - Don't trouble yourself. I thought that he looked a bit clueless, but in truth he was pretty dependable. Though, in fact, he is really clueless. This must have been the sweetest look I've ever watched a clueless man with in my life. Wot?! Take a break, Yoshiko. I'm used to this kind of stuff. I'll keep coming, again and again. SUNDAY, APRIL 19 Okamoto gave me a chair. So I put my old one outside my building at night. But I couldn't sleep. I felt sorry for it. So, I went out to check on it. You were looking at Miwa with lewd eyes. She's got big boobs and a hot body, plus that low-necked dress... Jeez, you're such a pervert. Come on, I'm a guy. I thought she was a mannequin. She creeped me out. Some strangers watched me closely. It's always like this. In the end, I can't throw it away. I'll put it out together with something else. So it won't feel lonely. Maybe that won't do either. FRIDAY, APRIL 24 FRIDAY, APRIL 24 I have a feeling he's waiting beyond the crossing. I haven't seen Okamoto this week. I wasn't able to. I tried, but I couldn't. SATURDAY, APRIL 25 56 YEAR-OLD GUY ARE YOU FREE FOR A DRINK TOMORROW NIGHT? When I want to see him, I can't. When I want to see him, I get contacted by some other guy. Life is testing me. SUNDAY, APRIL 26 SUNDAY, APRIL 26 Hello. - Welcome. - Hello. When I see this sign in Roman letters I can read it "Sale" now. But, there was a time it looked like "Sare" to me, "Go away" in Japanese. Go away. Go away. OK, I got it. - Thank you. - Thank you. MONDAY, APRIL 27 MONDAY, APRIL 27 Please check this. How's it going with Okamoto, lately? Getting along fine? It's OK to write it. But I can't say it. I'd really get fed up. THURSDAY, APRIL 30 THURSDAY, APRIL 30 I'm happy, but... THURSDAY, APRIL 30 I have a feeling that my life was better before. That's absolutely not true. I know that. I want to see the sea at night. The pitch black sea. SATURDAY, MAY 2 I went to the area I used to live before. SATURDAY, MAY 2 I think that viewing the past with nostalgia is helping me to keep my serenity. I'm negative and backward-looking. Instead of starting a new challenge... I prefer to protect the irreplaceable. Okamoto. Okamoto. Okamoto. Okamoto. SATURDAY, MAY 9 Excuse me. I'll measure the width. Could you please raise your toes? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Madam. Thank you, Madam. Now the other foot. Darn music. SATURDAY, MAY 16 I have no idea what kind of expression I should have on my face when I meet him after a while. It wasn't a long while, but I feel very nervous. I lose sight of myself. What kind of face am I making now? Hello. This way? I can be more honest with my feelings in front of a glass of wine. May I? Please come in. I'm sorry. It's OK. We kissed. Four times. I don't think it's necessary to record every detail. But, I'm not sure how to best imprint everything in my memory. So I'm writing it down. I wonder if the wine's chilled. You came to visit me with a bottle of wine. Is that the image you have of me? It's not like that. I like to watch you drinking wine. My friend from college is studying to become... What's it called... Um, concierge...? No... A wine... er... - Sommelier? - Yes! That's it. He suggested me some good wine. I'll go get it. Bad smell. Bad smell. Smelled bad. I swear. He's my dear one. MONDAY, MAY 18 Going to work together. How's your work schedule? Very busy? Not bad. I'll try to be true to my feelings today. FRIDAY, MAY 22 When I went back home and opened the door, I saw a pair of kids shoes. I didn't even ask myself whose kid that was. It just seemed natural. Then I looked closer. They were not kids shoes. It was just a stain. Then... It's my kid. FRIDAY, AUGUST 14 FRIDAY, AUGUST 14 Obon Festival vacation. FRIDAY, AUGUST 14 Okamoto went home to see his parents. I like that he didn't invite me. While he's out of Tokyo, I'll write it down. I love him. I'll try not to reread it afterwards. Cross, cross, cross. Circle. The rain doesn't stop. SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 6 If I can go on living like this, I don't need anything else. The moment I prepared myself for that, I felt so afraid I'll get left on my own and lose everything. But that's truly what I think. Now I can stand up straight more than I've ever did. FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11 OKAMOTO HAPPY BIRTHDAY For some reason, I didn't want him to know. But then I received his birthday wishes. I don't think I've told him. I guess he knew. No. I'm sorry. No, no... What shall I do? I'm trying to test him. But, in the end I'm the one who's been tested. I keep fumbling and fumbling, then I think I'm stupid. Dear Okamoto... It's like a refrain that'll be repeated until I die. No. Wakabayashi's going to treat me for my birthday this afternoon. There she is. Sorry for the wait. She's wearing sunglasses. I guess you wanted to spend the day alone with her. But we've decided this a year ago. I don't mind, really. I can't have lunch with her anymore because of you. She's mine today. Oh? What are you wearing? - Do you mean these? - Yeah. I wanted to try something new. Don't tell me if they suit me or not. I'll ignore any comment. Taking the challenge is the important thing. What are you saying? Looking at myself reflected in her sunglasses I realized I was smiling very happily. Okamoto! Let's go!
