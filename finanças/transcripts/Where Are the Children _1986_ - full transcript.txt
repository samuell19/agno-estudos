RADIO ANNOUNCER: Right about 7:00 and looking at the weather for the Cape. The weather bureau says we might get that storm a little sooner than had been expected. Rain should start by mid-morning, with temperatures in the low 40s. And if you haven't looked out your window, you might check it out. Beautiful leaves out there.

Mrs. Eldridge, uh... Mrs. Eldridge? Mrs. Eldridge, could you tell me, do the kids have any, like, secret hiding places? They're... They're gone. The lake. Excuse me? She's real upset, Ed.

(TUNING CHANNELS) LENNY ON RADIO: From what I can make out of these articles... Nancy Eldridge is really Nancy Holder, who was accused of murdering her two young children, nine years ago, on this very day. Thanks, Dorothy. Clay, the minute we have something, we'll let you know. In the meantime, if the kids show up, you smack their little behinds for me. And Mrs. Eldridge, we'll check out the lake, just in case. But really, I wouldn't worry. Can I talk to you for a minute, Chief? Did you find them? Excuse me. No, ma'am. ED: What is it? Hello. DISPATCHER: Dispatch. Yeah, this is Coffin. Patch me through to that guy, Barron, at OMR. Okay, Chief. The radio station? Yeah. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (TELEPHONE BUZZING) This is WOMR. Hit or rap. Go ahead, you're on the air. ON PHONE: This is Chief Coffin, Adamsport Police. Is this Lenny Barron? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. This is Lenny Barron. Go ahead, you're on the air, sir. You got some information on Nancy Eldridge? Yes, right. Yes, sir. It just came a little while ago. It's some old newspaper clippings and, well, three photographs. Well, I don't want you giving it out. You hear me? Uh, listen, man, I'm sorry, Chief... I... I just gave it out to Channel 8 News a little while ago. Listen, you button your lip till I talk to you! And don't let that stuff out of your sight! No, sir. No, sir. It's right here in front of me, sir. Yes, sir. Everything will be taken care of. Oh. ON TV: Good afternoon. I'm Natalie Wright with the Channel 8 Special Report on a late breaking story. Early this morning, Adamsport Police reported the disappearance of two small children, Michael and Missy Eldrigde. Police are now on the scene at the Eldridge property, questioning the mother, who has been revealed as accused murderess, Nancy Holder. Charles Slater reports live. In this rapidly developing story, there is still no news on the missing Eldridge children. As the U.S. Coast Guard and the state and local police battle the storm, in order to intensify their search for the missing children, a radio station, the Adamsport Public Radio Station, has revealed what may be another tragedy. The woman known here as Mrs. Clay Eldridge thought America had forgotten Nancy Holder. But today, no one can forget. It was nine years ago on this exact date that Peter and Lisa Holder disappeared. Two weeks later, their bodies washed ashore on a beach near San Francisco Bay, still covered by the plastic bags that suffocated them. In a controversial, often turbulent trial, their mother, Nancy Holder, was convicted of murdering both children. One week after the trail ended, her husband, Professor Carl Holder, inconsolable at the loss of his children, took his own life. Key prosecution witness, Robin Lakeler, an instructor in Professor Holder's biology department, fled to Canada. Nancy Holder's conviction was overturned on a technicality. The prosecution, without either Holder, who had killed himself, or Lakeler who had fled, had no case. (CROWD YELLING) Nancy Holder left California for Cape Cod, as we now know. She was never retried. This is Charles Slater, Adamsport, Massachusetts. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Good afternoon, kiddos. Did everyone have a good snooze? I've saved you some cookies and a glass... Uh-oh. Who didn't drink their milk? (ALARM BEEPING) Hmm? Michael, do you know what time it is? It's 12:30. You know how to tell time? Hmm? Uh-uh. Who are you? I'm a friend of your mommy. We're just playing a little game on Mommy for her birthday. Did you know that today's Mommy's birthday? Hey, Mikey, look at this. You ever see one of these? (LAUGHS) Neat, huh? Want an apple? Real juicy. Juicy-Lucy. (EXCLAIMING) I don't want any apple. Huh? I don't want any milk. I want to go home. All right. Not just yet, though. Mikey, you ever see a real telescope? Come on. I'll show you my telescope. Come on. Mommy, Mommy... Who is he, Michael? It's all right, Missy. We won't be gone long. Will we? Come on. Mister... Huh? Mister, please take us home. All right. But first, right now, let's go look at the telescope, huh? Come on. Missy'll be all right. Won't you, honey? Well, come on, leave your sister alone. MISSY: Michael. Don't go. She'll be all right. Missy'll be okay. Won't you, darling? We'll be right back, honey. Come on. Let's you and me go check out the telescope. What do you say? Mommy! Mommy! Michael! Mommy! Mommy! Michael! Come on. It's all right. Come on! There you go! There you go, little man. Wait a minute. That's it, look through there. Let me get the lens cap off. What do you see, pal? No, don't be a dork. Squeeze the other eye shut. That's it. Now what do you see? I see my house. That's right. You see, Michael, I've watched you for a long time. I know where you play and when you play. What are you looking at now? Huh? MICHAEL: All the cars. Cars? That's right. Something's wrong. Well, Michael, you know what it means to be dead? Huh? It means... It means to go to God. That's very good. You know, you're a very astute fellow. Well, you see, the reason all those cars and policemen are there, is because this morning your mother went to visit God. If... If Mommy went to God, I wanna go, too. Well, maybe you will. Well, will she come back? Maybe. Your daddy told me to mind you for a while. He told me to ask you to be a good boy, and for you to help me look after Missy. That's what he said. That's what he said. Mommy went to God. So, if she doesn't come back, I wanna go, too. You will. Tonight. I promise. I got the tickets. (HELICOPTER HOVERING) Those kids would not have gone near the water. Something's wrong. No. I know that. But it's not Nancy. Ed, I've known about her past since before we got married. OFFICER: Come on, get off there now. Move it. (JOURNALISTS CLAMORING) No pictures taken. Get going, get going. (SIGHS) I wanna take your wife down to the station, for her own protection. Is that all? We've got a lynch mentality here. Yeah. God, you take her down to the station, it's gonna destroy her. I'm not gonna book her. (THUD) OFFICER: Beat it! Beat it! Ed, come on now, I don't know what's going on around here any more than you do. But I can't stand around and let Nancy take the blame for it. Now, you got to treat her like any other woman whose kids are missing. Clay, your wife is not like any other woman. Mrs. Eldridge, I'm curious about something. You told me earlier, the last time you saw the children they were playing in the yard. Why did you go to the lake? For God sakes, Ed, she had two children drown. Please stay out of this, Dorothy. I understand you were upset this morning. Yes. It's my birthday today. It's the day my first... My first two children died. You had a nervous breakdown in prison, didn't you? After my husband committed suicide. Yes, I did. Come on, honey, let's go. She did say that they were in the lake. Yeah. She was the last one to see them. Mrs. Eldridge, I think it's going to be better for everybody if we continue this down at the station. I didn't hurt the children. (CROWD CLAMORING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) WOMAN: You monster! (REPORTERS CLAMORING) Watch... Watch 'em! REPORTER 1: Hey, do you have a confession from her yet? REPORTER 2: Is it true Nancy Holder was found on the lake this morning? No! No! (REPORTERS CLAMORING) Mrs. Eldridge is not under arrest. No, sir, you can't go in there. Please, I'm a friend of the Eldridges. No. Go. Sorry. You were in the house with Nancy Holder just now, right? Is it true she admitted she finally... No. No, mind your own business. REPORTER: Have you located the children yet? DOROTHY: Go on. Do you have any leads? DOROTHY: Go, move away.

Dorothy, Jonathan, this is Mr. Quill from the Governor's office. Yes, she's fine. She's in the conference room. We're questioning her. Ed, no matter what it looks like now, Nancy had nothing to do with this. How do you know? Well, Clay asked me to see Nancy professionally when she was pregnant with Missy. No question in my mind, Ed. She did not harm those first two children. You knew she was Nancy Holder? Yes, I did, Ed. Ed, those children in California disappeared nine years ago today. Nancy's birthday. The exact same age that Missy and Michael are right now. Coincidence? I don't think so. You've been watching too much television, Doc. Ed, please... Whoever killed those children in California is still out there. He's the kidnapper. I think Nancy can tell us who did it. Why didn't she tell us? Because it's... It's locked in her mind somewhere. Please, let me work with her. CLAY: Jon. Clay, Clay! Nancy. (INDISTINCT) NANCY: Jonathan. We're here to help you this time, Nancy. It's not gonna be like it was before. Thank you. Thank you.

You want me to tell them I let Nancy Holder go because she didn't like the bars on the windows? Just don't tell 'em. Your kids, too, Clay. What's that supposed to mean? I wouldn't want the same thing happen to you as happened to her first husband. But, Ed, look at how you're thinking. She told her boyfriend and I quote, "The children are going to be smothered." What do you think she meant by that? I was going to ask her the same thing, Clay. Then ask me. Don't talk about me like I'm... I'm not here. I told Rob Legler that, because I felt my marriage was smothering me. It was smothering my children. I was unhappy with my marriage. It wasn't good and it wasn't right. I stayed in it for the children. Why didn't you say this at the trial? Because I just wanted it over. Like I want it over if anything's happened to Michael or Missy. I just keep going because... Maybe they're... They're still alive. And maybe there's something that we can do. I've got to get out of here! Nancy, please! Come on. Hey, hey, come on. Hey, Nancy, stop. Leave her alone. Just leave her alone. CHIEF: All right. Calm down, everyone. (SOBBING) It's okay, honey. We just gotta be strong. Ed? We just picked up the guy at the radio station. I'll be right there.

No. So this could've been there from 10:00, 9:00, before the kidnapping. Why the hell would anybody put it in the box before the kidnapping? Because someone wants Nancy back on death row, where he had her nine years ago. Doc here wants to be a detective when he grows up. Listen, is this gonna take long? I'm being interviewed by Channel 8 in 15 minutes. What do you say? You can go now. What about my envelope? We'll hold on to it, if you don't mind. It was sent to me. It's my envelope. Right. Hmm, interesting. Ed, look at that. Is that you, Nancy? Yes. When was it taken? It looks like just after I got out of prison, when I was moving east. I'm at a bus station. Ah... Stockton, Merced, Fresno, Bakersfield. Then it is Sacramento, where I got on the bus. Miss Eldridge, do you have any idea who could've been taking pictures of you? No. CLAY: Sure like to know how that picture got in the envelope. I'm gonna take these down to the lab. I'll go with you. I'm sorry to make you come out on a day like this. Oh, it's my job. Well, there it is. Oh... The Lookout. Shall we make a run for it? (WIND HOWLING) Oh, it's... There's a tenant on the third floor apartment, but he's only got a two month rental, so there's no problem with the lease. I wonder how this place looks like at night. I'm sure I got the right keys. Oh, I hate to ring. Mr. Parrish asked me not to disturb him. Said he's writing a book about plant life on the Cape... Or something like that. Oh! He must've unlocked it. Well, you can see for yourself, this place is absolutely unique. I mean, I think that this place is really for you. I'm not just saying it. Can I see the upper floors? I would like to see the view. Oh, well, I hate to disturb Mr. Parrish. (SIGHING) If I'm going to buy this place, Mrs. Prentiss... Well, all right. The golf pro used to stay here summers. Turned the entire floor into a self-contained apartment, with a kitchenette. (DOOR SLAMS) Oh, my! Good heavens, you startled me. (STUTTERING) This is Mr. Kragopopoulos? Kragopoulos. Kragopoulos, from New York, I told you about. Oh, yes, yes. Mr. Parrish. Pleased to meet you. I'm Courtney Parrish. Would you mind terribly if I showed him the apartment? Well, I must confess, at the moment, it is a bit of an inconvenience. I wonder if you might possibly come back tomorrow? I have driven six hours to see this place and I have to be back tonight. Oh, I see. Well... It was part of our understanding, Mr. Parrish. Yes. Yes, of course. Well, show the man around. What a dreadful day to have to observe this wonderful house. You heard the terrible business about the Eldridges? Yes. Those poor children. Have they been found yet? A policeman came around and talked to me about it. Oh, it's so disturbing. That's quite a shock about that Nancy Holder, too, isn't it? You mean Nancy Eldridge. Yes. Well, whatever she calls herself now. Oh. PARRISH: That's the bedroom. Wasn't this piano downstairs? Yes. Yes, it was. It gets a better tone up here. Well, how in the world did you get it up here? Hmm. By the laws of simple physics. Oh, do you play, Mr. Parrish? Well, I try to. Not very well, I'm afraid. Do I hear water running? Oh, sugar! I forgot. Well... (GROANING) Oh, my! We interrupted your bath. I'm so sorry. It's all right. I don't exactly follow a rigid schedule, you know. (RUBBER DUCK SQUEAKING) Shall we go on? Oh. PARRISH: Watch your step. This is the bedroom. May I see the closet? What? That closet? You know I've been intending to ask Ms. Prentiss about this closet. I wanted to grow my night blooming aspidistra in there this season. But I thought you or that golf fellow must've changed the lock. I don't have a key for it. Well, there are keys for all these closets. I wouldn't twist that knob, if I were you. It might come off and we'll never get it open. The closet in the other bedroom is exactly the same, if you'd like to see it. Oh, no, no, no. That's all right. Does this door open? No. Absolutely not. Don't go out there. It's not safe. Please... The wood's all rotted. Nice telescope. I enjoy studying the stars. Is there any place else where the wood is rotted? The widow's walk, up here on the roof. It's all rotted through up there. If you'd like to have a look and maybe get yourself killed, please, be my guest. Oh, no, no, no, no. It's all right. ...buying it. (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) Strange man. If Mr. Parrish is right about the rot, I will definitely bring it up with the owner when we talk price. You know, I'm really sorry that you have to go back. You really should see this place on a nice day. Well, to be honest, Mrs. Prentiss, I'm not too sure this place is really for me. Oh, well. Go ahead. Go ahead. Oh, those damn leaves. I'll be right back. Let me have the umbrella. There. That's better. Oh! Something wrong, Mrs. Prentiss? Oh, my God. It's Missy's mitten. She was wearing it yesterday when I took she and Michael shopping. She must've dropped it in the front seat and I kicked it out just now. Oh, my God. Missy was always losing her mittens. (MUFFLED) How are my babies? Are you all right? Told you I'd be back. Why you... (GASPS) Poor little thing. Oh, oh. Wake up, honey. MICHAEL: Shut up! I'll deal with you in a minute, young man. Ah, Missy, hold still. Let me get your sister ready now. She's taking a bit of a snooze, isn't she? I said shut up! A little on the nod. Just a minute. Oh, come on now. It's bedtime, doll. I'll be back for you, young man. Poor little darling! Oh, my sweetie. Just a minute, Mikey, we'll be back. Why you... You be a good boy, Michael. Shut up! I'll be right back. That's not the kind of language to talk to me, is it? Nancy, we've got some news. We've got two separate reports from people who have seen Rob Legler on the Cape. A gas station attendant in Yarmouth, and another from a druggist in Hyannis. Where is he? I don't know. But we've got every cop in the county looking for him. Miles will drive you folks home whenever you're ready. Oh. Anything wrong, Mrs. Eldridge? Oh. That face. No... In the reeds. That face. Oh. CLAY: What face, honey? No. That was... That was him. I saw Rob. I saw Rob at the lake. (PHONE RINGING) I'll call you later, Clay. Why is he here? NEWSCASTER: We interrupt this early evening movie for a Channel 8 news brief. (RINGING) Police are searching for Robin Legler, key suspect in the disappearance of the Eldridge children. Legler was spotted in the Adamsport area this morning, driving a red Volkswagen bug with Canadian license plates. Anyone seeing this man should contact local police immediately. Now back to our movie. (ENGINE STARTING) Well... What shall we play now, pal? I won't wanna play games. Missy's sick. I told you, your sister is not sick. She's only taking a snooze. No, she's not! I wanna go home. All right. You both will be leaving here very soon, I assure you. I don't wanna go later. I wanna go now! Put this coat on, you're getting cold. You don't wanna get a cold, do you? Come on, put this coat on. Now, what do you say, you and Uncle Courtney play a little game? You wanna play Snoop? Snoop's a good game. Or we can play Keep Up. Or we could play Space Wizard. How about a game of Chinese checkers? Huh? Bet I can beat you, Mikey. Huh? You shouldn't have done that, mister. That can get you into big trouble. I think you need a glass of milk. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (LOUD CRACKLING) Check! Matches. (LAUGHING) Something happened. Oh, something blew. All right, don't you play with matches. Take care of your sister. Uncle Courtney'll be back in a minute. We'll be right back, Missy. Have a good sleep, darling. (EXCLAIMING) Oh! Been a very bad boy, Mikey. Bad boy. Here. What do you say, mister? (EXCLAIMING) Michael! Michael! Michael! Missy drank her milk. She's asleep. You didn't drink yours. Now you must be punished. Shit. (ENGINE RATTLING) God damn son of a bitch! God damn it! (GREEK MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) (SPEAKING IN GREEK) (REPLYING IN GREEK) Mineral water, from Sparta. Strong like bull. Phew! So, where you from, my friend? Kalamata. No. I mean here. Oh. New York. You have friends here? I come to look at a property I wanted for a nice restaurant. Which property? The Lookout. You know it? It's a cemetery. That crazy guy still up there? Do you know him? He comes in here the last couple of weeks. He never leaves the girl a tip. Right? He's a cheapskate, a stiff. He says he comes here to fish. I ask him how the blues are running. He looks at me like I'm talking Chinese. He fishes and he doesn't know blues? Doesn't know blues! Want some more coffee? Hey. Where you going? What's wrong? I have fantastic baklava for dessert. (WHISTLES) Kragopoulos. Where you going? Wait. You can come out now, Michael. I'm not angry anymore. Sorry I got angry, pal. Come on out. I know where you are. I'll take you home to your mommy. (WHIMPER) Mama. Welcome home. Power out? Fifteen minutes ago. Phone's been on and off all day. Stay in touch on the radio? Don't worry, Clay. It's no problem. All right. Get a fire started. Nancy. Come on out, Mikey. Uncle Courtney hurt his knee. Missy needs your help. (GROANS) Uncle Courtney needs your help. Might as well come out, Mikey. You know I'll find you. (WHIMPERS) JONATHAN: Nancy? What did you and Rob talk about? Marriage. Children. What about your children, Nancy? See, Rob told me I could leave Carl. I just... I didn't think I could. Why did you marry Carl? Did you love him? In the beginning, yes. Did he make you happy? NANCY: I didn't make him happy. JONATHAN: Is that why you wanted to leave him? He... He said that I... I didn't know what marriage is. Now what did he mean by that? What do you think Carl meant by that, Nancy? He wanted me to... Dress a certain way, do certain things... Dress how? JONATHAN: Nancy? Nancy? Nancy, how did Carl want you to dress? (SOBBING) Like a child! Like a little girl. And what was he doing that was so awful... Please. That you couldn't talk about it in court? I mean to defend yourself, to save your life? I just don't wanna talk about it. I'm afraid we have to talk about it, Nancy. Let's get to the point, Jonathan. Someone out there has got our kids. Now why are you taking her through this for? Please, Nancy, tell me. Jonathan? Tell me, Nancy, why did you leave Carl? Get to the point, Jonathan. Answer me, Nancy. Why did you leave Carl? Leave me alone. You left him because he was molesting the children, wasn't he? No. No! First, he dressed you like a little girl, and he treated you like a little girl. And then he did things to you that you didn't like. Then you had your children. And then he had his own little boy and his own little girl, and he didn't need you any longer. Because you'd given him the real thing. That's right, isn't it, Nancy? Isn't that right? Lisa... So... My little girl... As a little girl... (SIGHING) (SIRENS WAILING) What you doin'? Anybody with him? OFFICER: No. Take him down to the station and send his prints out on the wire. Yes, sir. Jonathan, coffee? No. No, thank you. Oh, the hell with it. Let me have a cup. Thank you. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yeah? Listen, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just thought you'd wanna know. They traced Legler to a motel up near Brewster. He stole a car. They just found it out of gas near Barnstable. We caught him. Good. Was he alone? Yeah. (HUMMING) ♪ I fell in love long ago ♪ With a sweet little girl ♪ That little girl was you Make sure the back doors are locked before you go back out to the car, all right? And put another log on the fire. MILES: Right. (SIGHING) Yeah. Honey, I'll call you just as soon as I talk to Legler. All right. Good. Be careful. Keys. Oh, here I have them. Be careful. ON TV: I lost my children and now I've lost my wife! NEWSCASTER: Though he never doubted her guilt, Professor Carl Holder appeared crushed by the jury's verdict. He looks real different. Who does? That guy on TV. What are you talking about? That guy on TV. That's the guy who gave me two bucks to deliver a package this morning. NEWSCASTER: ...Holder's boat was found a week later, abandoned off Point Ridge. The suicide note said "Nancy, I still love you." Hey, stup, the guy's dead! Do you wanna go home to your mother? She didn't go to God. She's all better. She wants to see you. Come on out and we can play a new game. We don't have to play Chinese checkers. Whatever you want. Boo! (THUD) I know where you are, Mikey. (WHIMPERING) I'm running out of patience. (RATTLING DOORKNOB) I know where you are, Mikey. I know where you are. This time you won't get away. I know. Uncle Courtney knows. Gotcha! (EXCLAIMING) You get off me! Get off of me! (EXCLAIMING) MICHAEL: Hey, hey, you! Who? Ooh. Get off me! KRAGOPOULOS: Run! Kid, run! Get off me! Leave us alone! You shouldn't be here! What you do with that boy, huh? What you do with that boy? Ah! Get back! Come on! I finish you! Hey! (GRUNTING) Put down that shovel, you! (GROANING) Take that! (PANTING) (GROANING) Foreigners. It's all right, Michael. Now we can be alone. Teach you to meddle. (PHONE RINGS) I'll get it. Hello? Mommy? Hello? Mommy! Michael! Mommy, you're alive. Michael... Michael, where are you? I don't know. Mommy, help us. Missy's sick. I will. I will, Michael. I'll come right away. Mommy, there's a man. A man? He tied me up. Oh, God. Put me in a closet. Are you all right? Where are you? PARRISH: Michael? Mommy! What does it look like? Is it far away? PARRISH: You can come out now, Michael. Michael? Michael? PARRISH: Don't you wanna go home? (DOOR SHUTS OVER PHONE) Michael? Can't take you home... Michael? Michael! Michael! (LINE DISCONNECTS) Oh, Jesus! Operator, operator! Mrs. Eldridge, let me take it. It was Michael! Hello? Hello? He said Missy was sick! Oh, God! Operator? I'll radio it in. Michael. It's dead. (THUDDING) (LOCKING DOOR) I know you're down here, Michael. I know. Where are you? Come on out, Michael. I won't hurt you. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. (RUSTLING) (LAUGHING) (YELLS) (LAUGHING) Where are you? (BANGING) As my daddy used to say, "What are you gonna do now, buddy boy?" (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (SQUEAKING) Please, don't hurt me. (ALL CHATTERING) (REPORTERS CLAMORING) REPORTER: Doctor! Doctor! Excuse me, Doctor, can I ask you just one question. I'm sorry to bother you... I want a lawyer. I got a right to a lawyer. You'll get a lawyer. Sit down, kid. Where are my kids? I got no idea. Son of a bitch, where are my kids? Clay! Clay! Now, I told you I don't want this. Please. Listen, look, I've had it. You guys are in for one sweet lawsuit. This is false arrest, harassment and I wanna see a lawyer. I told you you'd get a lawyer. Yeah. For God sakes, man, where are my kids? Why don't you go ask your wife? You son of a bitch! Clay, Clay, come on! Be calm. All right, all right. Clay! Look, damn it! Oh, God. What'd she do to you? What'd she do to make you hate her like this? Hate her? Man, I don't hate your wife. What do you think I'm doing here? I got this letter from her a month ago. "I want your help. I need your help." "Come to Adamsport. Call me at this number when you get here." "Come November 5th. I'm leaving my husband." Signed, Nan. Nancy never typed a letter in her life. Well, I sure didn't type it. I didn't write it! Oh... Look, I got this a month ago. I got another one a month before that. Well, look at the postmark, for Christ's sakes. It says Adamsport on it. Somebody could've mailed it for you. Oh, look at this guy. I'm not setting your wife up, man. Somebody set me up. I swear to you. Why do you think I've been in a motel room all day, dialing a phone number that nobody ever answers? Because the God damn letter says so, that's why! You guys wouldn't... You were the guy at the lake. You ran into the water. But who was that other guy in the car? What car? This white station wagon pulled away from the house. CHIEF: What time was this? I don't know. It was, uh, 10:00. Yeah. It pulled out and I thought it was Nan's husband. There were two sets of tire tracks. Sit down, kid. You're not... Let me have one of those. NANCY: It's the waiting. What if I kept Michael and Missy in this morning? (SIGHING) Oh, no. I was knitting this pair smaller. It just finally dawned on me I wasn't saving any money making them bigger because Missy always lost them, before she grew into them. Do you know, when I put on her mittens this morning, you know those sweet little red mittens with those kittens on them, I thought, "Please, Missy..." (SHUDDERING) What? I know where they are. Oh, my God, I know where the children are. What do you mean? Oh, my God! Where did you get this? At the Lookout, in the driveway. When I found it, I thought Missy must've dropped it in my car when I took her shopping yesterday. Why didn't... You should have told me! Because I thought it might upset you. Oh, my God! Nancy, its Parrish! Who's Parrish? He's renting the apartment at the Lookout. Oh, my God, the piano up there, and the little bath and the toy duck. And that telescope pointing right at your house. Nancy? I'm going to find them. Wait here for Miles and tell him where I am. How do I get in? There's a back door. Please, be careful. I'll try to get help. (ALARM BEEPING) Seven bells, kids. (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (GRUNTING) Hurry. What the hell is that? Power line's down. That's Nancy's car. Come on. CHIEF: We have the car. Nancy! OFFICER: Let's spread out. Nancy! Nancy! She's not in the car. She must've gone to the house. OFFICER: Let's get on the horn and call the power company. Hey! OFFICER 2: I got it. Turn 'em around! We'll go in by Post Road. Ed, what in the hell are you doing? We're going around back. Well, I'm not. Now come on, Clay! Go, go! You guys go in by boat. The rest of you come with me, we'll surround the place. Hold still. Put this on your head. Oh, man. (EXCLAIMING) Hold still! Mom! Michael! Oh, my God! Michael! Michael! Michael! Missy! Oh, God! My babies! Carl! (MICHAEL SQUEALING) You! You! (SHOUTING) Get outside, I'll drown you! MICHAEL: Mommy! Mommy! Get off me! (GRUNTING) Baby, are you... MICHAEL: Stop it! Michael! Get off my mommy! (SHOUTING) You killed them! You made me do this! You killed my babies! (MUMBLING) I didn't wanna do it! You bastard! You bastard! (KIDS SCREAMING) NANCY: No! Mommy. Help. Help. (SCREAMING) Mommy! Go, go, go. Get help. Go. (SCREAMING) Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Missy! Missy! Leave us alone! Leave us alone! Missy! Missy! Daddy! Michael! Michael! Oh, God, I've got you. Daddy. Daddy. Michael, are you all right? Yes, yes. (SCREAMING) Carl! Carl! Stop! She's mine! She's mine now! Stop! Carl, give her to me. Please, give me my daughter. Give me back Peter and Lisa. Give her to me. Carl. You thought you could take my children away from me. I couldn't let you do that ever! (SOBBING) Poor Peter and Lisa. You don't have to kill anybody, Carl. You killed them. You gave me no choice. You gave me no choice. Please, please. Stop. Don't come any closer. Please, Carl. Stop! Stay away! I'm warning you. No! Help! Stop! Police! Get down! Make them stay away. Back. Don't meddle with me. Don't meddle with me. I'll throw her! I'll throw her! (MISSY COUGHING) Hush, Missy. Give her to me. Give me my baby. It was you, Nancy. It was you! Get back now. Stay back. He's on the roof. Henry, take this, go round back. Come on, Doc. You give me no choice. Get back. No more deceit, Nancy. No more lies. Only the truth of Mother Nature! (MISSY WAILING) (PANTING) Let's show Mommy how well you swim, honey. NANCY: Oh, my God! CLAY: Nan! NANCY: Missy! Give her to me! (BOTH SHOUTING) Nan! (MISSY SCREAMING) NANCY: Give her to me! (ALL SCREAMING) NANCY: Help us! Help us please. Nancy! Oh! I got her! I got her! Come on. I got her! I got her. I got her. You! (CRYING) Mommy! (BRANCH SNAPPING) (SCREAMING) Mommy! (SOBBING) CLAY: It's over. It's over. Mommy! Michael. Mommy! My baby. Watch your step, it's slippery. There they are! There they are. Right there. OFFICER: All right, let's get 'em down. It's okay, Son. It's all right. Stay right close to me. Come on, honey. Watch the ice. All right. All right. Stay right close to me. Stay close. NANCY: You're okay. You're okay. Go on. CLAY: Watch it. Go a little bit more. That's a boy. NANCY: You're okay!
