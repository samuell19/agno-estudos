Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. I wasn't expecting that. Oh, I'm sorry, sir. They must have put me in the wrong compartment. Not if you're Colonel Savage. I'm General Aggaby. When I heard you were on your way back to England, I arranged to have you travel with me. That's very kind of you, sir. I, uh, didn't realize I'd be breaking up a leave-taking. I'm afraid you're stuck with her. Hope it isn't too hot in Calcutta. Why don't you get a cabin to yourself on the ship? I'd have raised Cain if I'd known. They're starting. I've got your address. I'll write to you. Good-bye, sir. Think of us sometime. We'll all Miss you. Oh, to heck with it! Good-bye, Victoria. Everything turned out the way it had to. I tried to keep you safe. Thank you. Oh, confound it! Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. What a very attractive girl. Englishwoman? No, sir. Indian... With English blood. Or English with Indian blood. Half-caste, if you like. Chee-chee. The race that never belonged to either side... And won't belong anywhere after we've pulled out. I'm one of the new boys they've flown out from H.Q. To speed up the British withdrawal. At the moment, I feel I'll never understand India, But I'm willing to learn. I gather your particular thorn in the flesh was... What was the name of that communist Who was behind all the anti-British riots? The Indian who was blowing up our troop trains? Davay. You manhunt a local martyr, And instead of cutting your throat, Your men decorate you with garlands when you pull out. Doesn't make sense. But Davay was as much their enemy as ours, sir. I see you're not anti-wog. I never call the Indians wogs. I never hate in the plural. When were you detailed to Bhowani Junction? Just after the Indian navy had mutinied, Excited the whole country to a fever pitch of patriotic sympathy. As a result of the Indian congress party supporting the mutiny, The government had anticipated nationwide trouble. I was detailed to Bhowani Junction with a battalion of batons As emergency reserves for the civil authorities. Things weren't made any easier for us by the congress party. They were afraid the British might change their minds about leaving. You remember, we hadn't specified any exact date, So they were determined to speed us on our way by every peaceful means at their disposal. The day I arrived a local train had been derailed, And the congress party quite naturally took advantage of this. Wherever the crowd was thickest, You could always see the party men in their little, white gandhi hats, Telling the people the best way to create harmless but well-organized confusion. The immediate idea of course was to bring the normal operation of Bhowani Junction As a railway center to a dead halt by choking it solid with crowds. Big crowds. Passive resistance means strict observance of law and order, mind you. But in other parts of town under the guise of genuine party members, The communist underground were all ready to turn genuine passive resistance Into a blood bath. What I didn't know until later was that Davay himself was already in the town, Popping up in 9 places at once to add fuel to the flames, But always keeping two jumps ahead of the police. Didn't help to arrest the party men. They loved going to jail. Helped to choke the jails and courts. Nor did it help that the congress party's local leader Was the darnedest mixture of a really noble patriot and donald duck. Mr. Surabhai. He had a genius for doing all the right things all the wrong way. Ah, excuse, good sir. I would like to ask you. When will this most inefficient railway Perform its duties faithfully? Not now, surabhai. Not now! I am asking you, sir. You see this ticket? But the poor devil who was getting it in the neck from all 4 corners Was the local traffic superintendent patrick Taylor. He was an anglo-Indian, and he felt the passive resistance had been deliberately rigged To persecute the anglo-Indians. Now, that may sound childish to you, but their bitter sense of belonging nowhere Makes anglo-Indians a touchy, high-strung lot. Doesn't take much to send them flying off the handle. Subaltern Victoria Jones was arriving back home after 4 years on active duty, And in those days, she was no exception to the rule. She had so many chips on her shoulder, You only had to cough politely to send them all flying. We are only poor natives, good sir. We are nothing. Forgive us for it. I know you congress fellas! Derail a train and go on a passive resistance spree! Oh, no, good sir, look at this ticket. We're waiting for the train. That's all. I have been watching you for some time now! I know you're their ruddy ringleader! You get them out of here! You do as I say! Get them out of here! Get them out of here! Patrick! Patrick! Vicki, I've been- Vicki, I've been- Oh, Miss Jones, on behalf of my brothers and myself, Accept our greeting. Oh, thank you, but I didn't expect quite such an ovation. Pleasure, pleasure. Oh, I'm so sorry. You are sorry? He pushed me, the haughty fellow. Let's get out of this mess and go somewhere where we can be alone. Mr. Taylor, Mr. Taylor, it's urgent! A British officer wants to see you immediately. I'm not a stooge at the beck and call of every British officer. Perhaps you ought to. I'll teach them wasting my time. You watch me! Aren't you supposed to be the traffic warden around here? I'm district traffic superintendent, yes. Well, there don't seem to be any particular arrangements, do there? What do you expect? A brass band and the whole of Bhowani district staff on parade? Listen, I don't want any of that chee-chee back chat out of you! That will do! There don't seem to be any arrangements, sir. My name's Savage. I command the first battalion, 13th frontier force rifles. Haven't you got a telegram from headquarters delhi Warning you that my battalion's on its way? Telegram? No, sir. I'd know because I'm in charge here. If you're in charge, this mess is yours. I'll take that. The advance party of my battalion are packed like sardines on a train Down the line in this heat. I don't propose they shall suffer for your mistakes. If anyone suffers I'll see that it's you. But, sir, I don't understand- Excuse me, sir, I worked in transportation directorate delhi. The man who sends out the telegram is awfully nice, But sometimes he forgets to send copies to everyone concerned. We've had that trouble before, colonel. Get this off as quick as you can. Let's go to your office. You'd better come, too. What are you doing? Careful now. You nearly fell. What's your name? Jones. You better walk ahead of us, subaltern Jones. I should have got angry with McDaniel. Instead I got angry with her. Kasel, there's a military special on its way here. Find out where it is. I know, Mr. Taylor, I just had a message. What the devil do you mean "you know"? Why didn't you tell me? I was going to- I am responsible here! You had no business not to tell me at once! At once, do you hear? Finish your squabble later. I'm expecting the collector in a few minutes for a briefing. Now, listen, my battalion is coming here for internal security duties, Particularly railway protection. I'll need an office - uh, kasel, would you please take notes? I want the use of your motor trolleys- Colonel, there are railway regulations for the use of motor trolleys. I want a covered wagon to be used as a mobile canteen. I'm going to provide platoon guards on the main line. But they'll be trouble- I'll put field telephones in here for you. One of you will have to be in close touch with me at all times So that my trolley patrols do not run into unscheduled trains. Colonel, look here, I can't- I'll show them you can't argue with printed regulations. You see, colonel, I'm not authorized to lend you rolling stock of the railway. Your job is to get things done, Mr. Taylor, Not to find reasons why they can't be done. He didn't even give me a chance. Swine! Did you see what he did to me? Acted as though I'd led that filthy man on. We anglo-Indians may as well cut our throats. Between the military and the wogs... Even the new collector's a wog called Govindaswami. Think of it! The lord and master of this whole district! A real black- Oh, Mr. Collector, the colonel's here. I'll tell him. Colonel, I thought you might like to know- Mr. Govindaswami. And this is George Lanson, colonel. He's head of civil police and my right-hand man. Good. You and I can work together then, Lanson. You know Taylor, don't you, sir? Subaltern Jones, the wack-eyes. Miss Jones, I know your father, welcome home. Thank you, sir. Well, colonel, I feel a little happier now your battalion's on its way here. What you've seen today is typical of what is happening all over India With this difference: We've a man hiding here in Bhowani who will do everything he can To turn passive resistance into bloody revolution. Does the name Davay mean anything to you? Davay? Is that the chap who went over to the japs in '42? Then found his way to soviet central asia. Two weeks ago suddenly reappears in Calcutta. Now here. Apparently has friends. A brilliant organizer as well as clever with his hands. Taylor, may we use your office? Certainly, colonel, I'll get some chairs. Now, this concerns all of you. Miss Jones, would you mind? What about Davay? What's he up to now? Getting ready for the big emergency. That's when he'll strike. There's already mutiny in the Indian navy. There's danger of a big railway strike in sympathy. There was a derailment here this morning. That was almost certainly Davay, a rehearsal for worse to come. I knew it! Surabhai and the congress party. They knew all about this derailment, Swarming over the station and taking advantage. I told him! I told surabhai! Didn't I, Victoria? No, Mr. Taylor, I'm afraid it isn't as simple as that. Mr. Surabhai, for all his love of conspiracy, is a man of peace, a patriot. Call that patriotic, choking up a railway? Mr. Surabhai hates everything Davay and the communists stand for. He genuinely believes, as gandhi does, That passive resistance will put the congress party in power peacefully. But Davay's crowd want to make it impossible for congress to govern After the British leave. But who can rule after, except congress? Who do they want? Their masters and their minds are in moscow. They want to reduce India to chaos and anarchy so that they can take over. But all congress wants, with all due respect, old chap, Is to hurry the British as peacefully as possible out of India. Nothing personal, of course. Far from it. Once you've gone, we'll Miss you all terribly. Yes. I have been called a lackey of British imperialism. I'm not. I work for the day when India will be for the Indians Because I, too, shall we say, am a native... A wog... But I do not conspire with those who would end British rule in a bloodbath. Could we have a private word, sir? Oh, yes, sir. In my office here on the left. Looks as if they're breaking up. Yes, they've let off steam. Thank goodness. What will happen tomorrow or next week, no one knows. Right through here. Thank you. What's your full name? Victoria Jones. Army number? 746. Status? On leave, pending release. Miss Jones, you obviously know the workings of the railways here, And you know the army. I'd very much like you back on active service as liaison between us. I'm afraid I have other things to do. Isn't it about time you condescended to accept India as your own country? You might find it worth protecting. I spent the last 4 years- Forget the last 4 years! You've got ears, haven't you? You heard what Mr. Govindaswami's just been saying. That will be all for now. Let's go. Well, good-bye. No need for that. Blast all the ruddy military to blazes! Get on. Eyes front. Where's your hat? I never wear it unless I have to. But the sun! You'll get all brown. It's the hottest time of day. It's not the sun that makes us brown, is it? It was obvious that Taylor was head over heels in love with her. I'd be a liar if I said I hadn't found her very attractive myself. But I'd seen enough of situations between officers and anglo-Indian girls. I decided to keep my feelings to myself and my mind on the job. Pater! Pater, darling! Pater! Pater, dear! My girl. My very own girl. Where's mother? Inside, probably. Waiting for you. Mater! She called her father pater and her mother mater. Everything in their own little world was just secondhand illusion. It was begged, borrowed, or stolen from the British society that had made them And then rejected them in the same breath. My baby! My lovely child! Here are the soldiers, mother, look. Isn't that a lovely sight? Victoria, there's that colonel again. Victoria! Victoria, is that the colonel you didn't like? Why, he seems ever such a fine gentleman to me. I say, why don't you ask the colonel If he'd like to come in after for a nice glass of beer, eh? Splendid. You know, Victoria, he'd be nicer to us then. He'd know who we were. He's got a pretty good idea now. Oh, dear me. Whatever would happen to India If men like the colonel ever decided to pack up and go home. I know, pater, but they're going to leave. Most people in delhi say very soon. They can't leave! If the British left India, what would happen to us anglo-Indians? We'd be finished! But, patrick, most of the British I talked to in delhi- They hardly know there are such things as anglo-Indians. We're just a drop in the bucket to them and to the Indians. I suppose we must look jolly small to you After all that la-di-da stuff in delhi. But you're still one of us, Victoria, And the sooner you get that back in your head the better. Mater, let me help you with that. No, you sit down, child and let me spoil you a bit. I haven't had a chance as yet. You've been away so long. Too long! That's the trouble with her if you ask me. Patrick, I only mean... Sometimes we talk as if the lord fixed everything in India So that it can't ever change, but it is changing, And the sooner we face it, the better. Do you think a ruddy congress government Would go on holding jobs open specially for us on the railway like the British do? I don't like Colonel Savage any more than you do, But if the Indians have their go, we'll left with nothing. Our schools, our positions-they'd take the ruddy lot! Then let them! At least we'd stand on our own feet like other people. Yes, and we may as well throw away our topis and turn our skins black. We'll be nobodies! It isn't just jobs! It's our social position! It's who you are! And who are we? I'll tell you! Chee-chees! Blackie-whites! Victoria! What are you trying to do, child? Hurt us? I'm only trying to make patrick see the truth, That when the British go we must take our fate into our own hands. If the British go, I go home with them! Home? Where is your home, man? England? Then you fell in the black sea on your way here! Victoria, stop this! I used to think the way you do, But I've spent 4 years with Englishmen and Indians. They know who they are! We don't! We can't become English because we're half-Indian. We can't become Indian because we're half-English. I've discovered it's a wonderful thing to know who you are, and that's what we don't know. The past is gone, the present going! I'm asking you to think, man! Use your head and think! Victoria. Victoria, let me come in. Come in, then. Do you think I'm trying to run away from you all? My dear, I'd be running away from myself, wouldn't I? I know you think what I said was wrong, Victoria, But we have to use our hearts, not our heads. It is my heart that makes me disagree with you, patrick, As well as my head. You have no idea how fresh and free it is To be English or to be Indian. Why must we torture ourselves with ideas that we're better or worse than other people? Why don't we put on dhotis and saris and marry Indians if we want to? Could you? I don't know. But I could never marry anyone but you, Victoria, And I thought you could never marry anyone but me. It used to be like that. You and me, and no one else for either of us. I want to marry you, Victoria. I want you to want me. What's wrong, Victoria? The waac directorate in delhi. What does it say? "leave canceled owing to emergency. Report to officer commanding first battalion He did it. Colonel Savage. Straight to the head of the waci. I hate him. What are you going to do? I could go sick. He'd send a doctor. Yes, he would. I am in the service. There is an emergency. He's got me. You see, after all, our fate isn't in our own hands. I have to do it. Victoria, what about us? You and I? We? Do what we're meant to do. Run the ruddy railway. Isn't that what we were born for, man? So Victoria Jones reported for duty in the traffic office. Mcdaniel operated from there as well, And he operated as if his duties were at the bottom of a sewer. Miss Jones! Miss Jones! Here are the timetables for the colonel. Oh, thank you, Ranjit. I see the 10 mail up is leaving later. How they love to watch the soldiers. But I suppose we all do. I prefer to watch the children. They are the future, Miss Jones, the new India. For them life will be very different, And it will not be politics, But education that will have shaped them. That is where I would like to do my work-education. Our country will open like a flower once the British are gone And India is free. The 68 up is on time. You're not too fond of the British, are you, ranjit? But you can cope with them, can't you? Well, like most Indians, I have learned to bend a little with the wind. You know, it quite bowled me over Finding someone like you in a place like this. Well, you're not being very friendly, are you? The same unrest was breaking out all over India. At Bhowani the congress party's efforts were rewarded by a railway strike In support of the naval mutineers. The anglo-Indians tried to stick to their jobs But got dragged out and shaken up for their pains. Hundreds of miles of vital communications were paralyzed in as many minutes. Up north, an ammunition train was abandoned. Just far enough out of reach of our protection to be nicely in reach of Davay's looters. Well, that didn't seem to worry the congress party. To them the strike was an occasion for full-scale celebration. As long as they kept the strike going, the British were hamstrung. So they were going to keep the strike going or bust. Good day, sir. Carry on. That's why they give wack-eyes khaki safety-first knickers. We've had enough of these jokes, colonel. Victoria's under your orders Because you went behind her back and pulled strings, But she doesn't have to be insulted. I think the controller will be glad to see you, colonel. Looks like trouble, huh? Appears so, colonel. Mr. Surabhai and his flock seem to be determined to stop your train. He better not try. There's enough loose dynamite lying at mauro to blow up half the town. I don't want to cramp your style, colonel, But I'm afraid it's very much touch and go here, So keep a tight rein on your chaps. Passive resistance, so-called, is notoriously difficult to deal with. Ugly customers those, sir. Would you like me to close the gate? No, let them in. There's no law against it. We're likely to have some bricks fired at us. Still want to stay? It's my father who will be driving that engine through, sir. Ah, Mr. Collector. You and your lieutenant colonel And all his war dogs cannot stop us. So nice to meet you here, Miss Jones. We are perfectly legal in our peaceful protest Against the slaughtering of our naval brothers. Nobody's been slaughtered yet, Mr. Surabhai. Those sailors are your naval brothers as well as mine, Even though you glory in your post as lackey of the British imperialists. We will make protest, peaceable, nonviolent protest. A nonviolent Missile, Mr. Surabhai? No, no, no, my friends. Please, no violence. I beseech you. Let not your natural feelings get on top of you. Enough of this confabulation. 'tis to no purpose. I'm going out to join my comrades. Lay down! Lay down! Mr. Surabhai, this train is on a Mission of mercy. There's dynamite lying unguarded at mauro. If the wrong people get their hands on it, They can turn this thing into a blood bath. British lies to deceive the people! Lies! Lies! Lies! No, my friends. No violence, please. I am warning you all to disperse. In one minute the military will open fire and clear the platform. Murderers. Murderers. What do you want to do about these people? I don't honestly know. I don't want them hurt. Mr. Jones, get your engine all ready to start. Yes, colonel, I'm ready now. Colonel Savage! Please don't let him do it, sir! Mr. Surabhai won't get up! Why do you think he won't get up? Because he believes he's right, because he's brave. I think she's right, sir. Mr. Surabhai's always wanted to be a martyr. Miss Jones, I expect I'm as good a judge Of Mr. Surabhai's character as you are. Mind your own business! Will you get your people off the track? Because I'm going to move my train. Then you will move it over the bodies of dead Indians. Mr. Surabhai, are you a high-caste hindu? Yes, but all castes are like one in the fight for freedom. Good. You're all of you going to be used as a sewer by these untouchables. What did you say? What are you going to do? Oh, you beastly, horrible... I give you 5 seconds, or prepare yourself for 5 months' purification. One... Two... 3... 4... 5! I suppose the heart of Victoria Jones that was Indian Was revolted at the degradation of surabhai at British hands. I hate the lot of you sometimes. I'll take my white face out of here. We'll be gone for good soon enough. Yes, run away. Surabhai makes me very bad-tempered. He's the stuff heroes are made of. Look here, don't go wandering around the city tonight. Have you heard something already? No, but I'm an Indian. There will be repercussions. Take my word-it won't be safe for white faces. By heaven I wish we could catch Davay. You don't look well, Miss Jones. You're a cruel bully. The path of duty is the way to glory. I'll drive you home now. Mr. Taylor will take me home. Yes, certainly, I will. Ha ha ha! Oh, that's good! That's Colonel Savage's idea, eh? Oh, oh, I'll never think badly of him again. That's priceless! Ha ha! Don't you think it's funny? That will make them look foolish, I'll bet! Can't you understand anything? Can't you understand how they feel or me? I came back from delhi ready to love you, And I found you were all the things I don't want to be. When I'm happy, you spoil it. When I'm in trouble, you don't notice. When I want you to do something, you won't do it. When I ask you not to do something- but! Don't but me, you fool! You're a snob, and you're self-satisfied! And you're-you're a ruddy chee-chee! And you make me behave like a chee-chee, too! Now, go away! I don't ever want to see you again except on duty. It was awful. Ranjit... Please forgive... I hated it. We've learned to turn away from such things. But you in the kindness of your heart were hurt. That is why I'm sorry. Hello, Baker. Send your message. Over. Hello, Baker. Sun Ray speaking. Fetch liaise officer. Over. Colonel Savage. Hello, baker. Liaise officer on set, over. Hello, Baker. The wires are down, and I can't reach Govindaswami. Tell him that the dynamite was stolen before the rescue train got to mauro. Ask him to meet me at the hindu temple. Fire and looting. Over. Hello, baker. Wilco. Out. Mr. Govindaswami, please. So Colonel Savage lost after all. We were expecting riots, and we got them... With a vengeance. Davay's henchmen did a thorough job Of rousing up the lawless element that exists in every town And setting them loose among the demonstrators until the whole place ran amok. They persecuted whoever they felt like persecuting, Played up old religious differences, looted, Plundered the shops, Ruined the merchants by setting fire to their freshly dyed silks Where they were hanging up to dry. Hello, baker. Wilco, over. Hello, Baker. Close down now. Out. Please let me see you to your house, Miss Jones. There's no need for that. I would not like you to go alone. If you wait until the troop train comes through, I'll go with you. I'll walk down there. At night it's patrolled. You don't think of me as an Indian, do you, ranjit? No, Miss Jones. As a european. I feel as if I've come to the point where I don't belong anywhere. Good night. Oh, there we are. Well, stop trembling. Your uncle graham isn't going to hurt you. You know, it's a good job I saw you. Now, for heaven sake, Victoria, if anyone says halt, Stop and say chaka- it's tonight's password. Oh, chaka. Fine, well, I'll go on from here. Wait. Colonel Savage would chew me to pieces if anything happened to you. I say, he's not turning sweet on you himself, is he? There's no need for you to come any further. Good night. Halt! Who go there? Chaka. proceed. Almost out of the woods. There you are. You're nearly home. Yes, I know. Thank you. Well, aren't you going to thank me properly? Thank you very much, captain McDaniel. Come on. Thank me like this. Come on! Stop struggling! Put that down, Miss Jones. Come quickly. Come! Who did she kill, my son? I didn't kill anybody. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. Look, girl. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Now, who has she killed, son? A British officer. Captain McDaniel. In the yards. He deserved it. Is he still there? Do you think he's been discovered yet? I don't think so. He tried to rape me. Ah. Son, call our friend. But, mother, do you think that's wise? I mean, to tell anybody else? Yes, I must tell the collector. I must tell Mr. Lanson right away. And what will they think when they know you came straight here? And who do you think they will put the guilt on? My son. He has tried to help you. Now he is in this with you. Now, hurry and fetch our friend. Now take all these clothes off. Be quick. Here. Mari! Soap, water, basin, and that stain remover. You know what has happened? Yes. I'll go at once. I'll be back in half an hour at the most. What are you going to do? I must tell someone. They'll say you led the Englishman on. They will say anything to protect his reputation, the army's reputation, not yours. Our friend will arrange it so they will never find out who did it. Sit down, girls. Sit down. Son, bring a chair for her here. You don't seem to realize I killed somebody. You killed an Englishman, an army officer. That's not a person. That's an animal. Give her a drink, son. Why should you support the British law? You're half Indian, aren't you? He tried before. It was awful. Quiet, girl. My charge, you've done a great thing. Today you are heroine of the new India. I seldom drink, but I drink to you now. Go and see if anybody's watching this house. I must- You must! Have you ever met an Englishman that didn't insult you? Haven't your own people worked for them for 100 years? And how are they going to reward you? They're going to leave you here with us. What do you think we are going to do with anglo-Indians? We're going to make you realize that you are Indians. Inferior Indians. Possibly disloyal Indians because you spent the last 100 years Licking England's boots and kicking us with your own boots. I saw what the soldiers did to our people at the station. I saw you. You didn't look happy. Why don't you see that you are an Indian and act like one? Here. Put this on until your clothes are dry. Our friend will be back very soon. Ah, no wonder my son is in love with you... And you are just the woman for him. But I never thought of him in that way. Any man will do for you. Well, do not be angry. I mean, you need a man. You are quite old, you know. Ha ha ha! My son is a good boy, but he needs a woman of purpose. He talks of returning to the sikh religion. Foolish! You are stronger than he is. You can make of him whatever you wish. But I think he's very nice the way he is. Here. Look. India is your home, my child. The dawn is breaking now. Our dawn, our sun, our freedom. We will stand by whatever you do always. Trust us. Well? They're gone. Keep the sari, my child. Wear it proudly. Tomorrow my son will invite you for a visit. You must come. Some interesting people may call, And I want to see you again. And remember, nobody but us should know that our friend ghanshyam is staying here. Why mustn't I mention ghanshyam? Who is he? A gentleman from western India. My mother's devoted to him. She doesn't want him implicated in this. I brought the body into the city and buried it where it won't be found for several days. But the sentry that challenged them? And me? Don't worry. He's a friend. I saw him on the way back. He won't say anything. Now, we must get our stories straight. You left captain McDaniel by a signal box outside your home. You said good night... The next thing we all knew, Victoria and Ranjit were appearing together publicly. In case one or two of us were a bit slow on the uptake, The wardrobe was thrown in as an unmistakable gesture of defiance. Victoria, I shall never get over seeing you Just take out a cigarette and smoke it. In a sari, you mean. Yes. All the ordinary Indian ladies will have a fit. What about your mother? Oh, she won't mind. She's not ordinary. There is Mr. Taylor. Do you think it wise? Come on. If I have to hide now, I might as well give up altogether. Lemonade, please. Same for you, ranjit? What are you doing here? Seeing a picture with ranjit. You came here with kasel? Oh, patrick, you clumsy- Oh, colonel, jolly good idea that of yours- You know, what your men did to those wogs lying on the railway line. Would you mind not trying to drag me into your mating squabbles? It's like that, eh? All open and above board. The lady left-oww! Ranjit, would you find a table for us and hold it, please? Why don't you go to the wog cinema? That's where you belong, isn't it? Holding hands and throwing betel nuts with your black boyfriend? Don't you say that about ranjit! To me or anybody else! Then keep him out of here! This is for europeans! I'll see this picture with ranjit and anything else I ruddy well please! Do you see? Now, you go home and sober up! And learn to behave yourself! Vic-Victoria, I wasn't going to hit you. Vicki, this is an awful way for us to be. Why don't you marry me? I only get drunk because I'm so miserable. Marry you and sit in the house all day with a topi on my head Because somebody might think I'm an Indian? Not me! Are you having love troubles, Miss Jones? It's none of your business, sir. If you started wearing these winding sheets in order to shake off Taylor, You're much cleverer than you have a right to be with your other armament. If you're doing it because you're interested in ranjit kasel, Well, that's a horse of a different color... Miss starkey. Why did he call you Miss starkey? To hurt. I don't always understand Colonel Savage. I wish I didn't always understand him. But I want to be able to share these things with you, Victoria. Then listen. There was a young lady named starkey, Who got herself hitched to a darky. The result of her sins was an eightsome of twins, Two black, two white, and 4 khaki. Ohh! Ha ha! Good evening, Miss Jones. I'm sorry to butt in, but may I? You're changing worlds, I see. Meeting new friends. I wonder if you can help me. Perhaps you've seen this man here in Bhowani... Or anyone like him. Now, take a good look. No, I've never seen this man. Ranjit, you get around town a good deal. Have you ever seen this man? No, I haven't. Who is he? Davay. Taken 8 years ago. We've reason to believe that it was he who stole the dynamite at mauro. Good night. Miss Jones, may I have a word with you, please? Alone. It's about McDaniel. How can I help? He's still Missing, you know. When he left you at the signal post, did he tell you where he was going? He just said good night, and I left. But I've told you that before. Well, after all, you are the last person who saw him, As far as we know. Now, when he said good night to you, Did he try to kiss you? Did you kiss him? Anything? I'm really sorry about this, but I've a good reason for asking. It seems that McDaniel had been telling his friends around here That he was very fond of you. He even indicated that you returned this feeling. Well, what I'm getting at is that if you did in fact like him- I did not like him, Mr. Lanson! He made advances to me once- He did? I didn't encourage him then or any other time. But you let him accompany you home. It was the night of the riot, and I- Lanson! You should know better than to question an officer serving with my regiment Without first asking my perMission. Well, if you'd been here- I heard the last part of what you were saying- Miss Jones so obviously disliked McDaniel That I ordered him never to be alone with her anywhere. Very well, Miss Jones. May I remind you that I've got my duties just the same as you have yours? I'm still looking for that sentry of yours who disappeared the same time as McDaniel, And there's no trace! That sari suits you. I cannot tell you how much. Why do you think I wear it? All the criticism only made her more stubborn. She put up a carefree front, But behind it she was desperately anxious to persuade herself That her liking and respect for ranjit would turn to love... Once she had entered his world and learned to become an Indian. That music! What is it, ranjit? It is a love song. It is quite well known. Everything's new to me. I have an awful lot to learn. About music? Yes, that... And everything. Miss Jones- For heaven's sake, ranjit. Call me Victoria. I admire you... Victoria. And I am honorably in love with you. I wanted you to have time to know me better, But my mother told me to hurry or you would marry somebody else- She said that if I did not make up your mind for you, she would. I won't hurry, not even for your mother, And anyway, I'd rather you asked me. But I would not know how to ask you. Very well, then, I'll ask you. When the time comes. I'm sorry, Victoria... I too have much to learn about your ways. The day after tomorrow, I am going to the sikh temple To be received back in my religion. You mean you would want me to become a sikh If we get married. I would, Victoria. You would have to have another name then, Victoria is not a proper name for an Indian. No, it isn't... But Victoria is my name. Would I have to live here with your mother? Of course. Otherwise, they would say I threw her out. You know, ranjit, I think it's time you broke away from your mother. Yes, I suppose it is. You will come with me? I will, if that's the way it must be. This is our holy book. You will need it for the service. Read it. Well, the strike ended, and the railway was back to normal. To an uninitiated eye, order was successfully restored, And the situation was in hand at last. To us, it was simply a question of when and where Davay would strike again. Will you get those stretchers over here? Hurry up. Someone's dying over here. It's no good. He's dead. Don't dally! Can't be here all day! I've got other things to do! Sergeant, get your boys who aren't injured to work as stretcher bearers. Colonel! Colonel, we found this. Aha! Just what I thought... F.I.D. Wire, mark 4 detonator caps- All army ordinance, the same as the stuff that was taken at mari. Once Davay got his hands on it, This was a foregone conclusion. It wouldn't have been, if we'd caught him first. Swing it round more! Watch your heads on the roof! Please, sir, this way, please! Heroic white sari suits you. Doesn't go what I brought you here for. The duty officer didn't give me time to get into uniform. Why did you force me to come here? Find the O.C. Troops. Ask him if he's got any medical personnel on the train. If he's got them, take them down to the R.A.P. You go with them or report to the M.O. Where the devil do you think you're going? Why did you force me to come here? So that you could see what dynamite does to the human body- The dynamite that was stolen at mari. I didn't do this! Well, they didn't do it, either! Now go help the poor beggars who are dying! Here, you! Wash down this woman! What are you waiting for? Take her over there, can't you? Swab her down, I said! Take it away! Get the hose this way! Here, take these across to that first-aid wagon over there. Do whatever he tells you. Metha... Did you have a hand in this? I'm only helping... And watching the death agony of the British empire. It isn't just British soldiers, It's our own people, too! You cannot make omelet without breaking eggs. Your mother will tell you that. Patrick, let me wash that cut. I don't want your hands on me. Ranjit... Do you think Ghanshyam is Davay? I'm not sure. I hate to believe it, But I'm beginning to think he might be. What if he is? Ghanshyam buried the body at great risk. If we give him away, he'll tell the truth about you and McDaniel. But if he is Davay and did this... What are we going to do? If there's any doubt, I cannot do anything. They'll arrest my mother. She's fought the British for 26 years. She's been in jail many times. I can't send her to prison again. Get going! Don't tell me you're still on your own two feet. There's hope for you yet. Afternoon. Hello, Mr. Lanson. If you wanted to see Colonel Savage, I'm afraid- No, thank you. It's you I want to talk to. Captain McDaniel's body was found early this morning, In a dung heap in the city. Had a notice hung round the neck: "Quit India." The head was battered in and other mutilations carried out. You're surprised, why? I was just thinking, how horrible. When was he killed? Oh, we know when he was killed, Miss Jones. To the hour, nearly to the minute. But I'm afraid that's not quite all. You will remember that the sentry who was on duty in the yards The night of McDaniel's murder has been Missing as well? We found his body at the same time. The throat was cut. He'd been murdered at the same time as McDaniel, An hour later at the most... And since both bodies were found at the same place, We're assuming that whoever disposed of McDaniel Killed the sentry as well. You're still certain that you've never met The stranger in this town who is Davay But calls himself ghanshyam? All right, Miss Jones... That's all I want to find out. I'm afraid in a day or so I may have to ask you To come down to my headquarters. I do hope for your own good That you're not trying to shield anyone. I beg to be received back into the true faith, And I want her to become a sikh. Do you agree? Yes. May you be blessed in the name of the lord. What are you trying to do, child, hurt us? Why don't you see that you are an Indian and act like one? Why don't you go to the wog cinema? That's where you belong, isn't it? Holding hands and chewing betel nut with your black boyfriend? We can't become English because we're half Indian, We can't become Indian because we're half English. What are you trying to do, child? Hurt us? I don't belong anywhere. I don't belong anywhere! I don't belong anywhere. I admire you, Victoria, And I am honorably in love with you. I wanted you to have time to know me, but my mother told me to hurry Or you would marry somebody else. She told me that if I did not make up your mind for you, she would... I too, shall we say, am related. A wog! But I do not conspire with those who would end British rule in a bloodbath. I brought the body into the city and buried it Where it won't be found for several days... several days. Captain McDaniel's body was found earlier this morning, in a dung heap in the city... The head was battered in and other mutilations carried out. You don't seem to realize I killed somebody. You killed an Englishman, an army officer. That's not a person- that's an animal. The sentry who was on duty in the yards? We found his body at the same time. The throat was cut. I didn't do this! They didn't do it, either! Go and help the poor beggars who are dying. By heaven, I wish we could catch Davay! Ghanshyam is Davay... Ghanshyam is Davay... You're not trying to shield anyone. You killed an Englishman, an army officer. That's not a person- that's an animal. Ghanshyam is Davay... Whoever disposed of McDaniel killed the sentry as well. His throat was cut. That's a horse of a different color... You don't seem to realize I killed somebody... You killed an Englishman, an army officer. That's not a person- that's an animal. I must tell someone. I must tell someone! I must tell someone! It was clear to Victoria that in trying to run away from her conscience... She had only run into disaster. She couldn't run away from her conscience. The only one she could turn to was her father. She had enough sense left to remember that he was taking the afternoon local to gandwara. Pater... Pater... Still glad to see me. That's good, anyhow. What is your name now? Victoria Jones. I was frightened. Oh... I must get away from here. I could visit the macintires in gandwara For a few days. I want to be with you. Let me come with you in your cab. I wish you could, but I should lose my job. Good afternoon, Mr. Jones... Hello, sir. Miss Jones. How have they been treating you Since you ran that train through for me? It's been rather difficult, sir. But then, all the anglo-Indians been having a bad time. Yes, I know. See if I can't lay my hands on another rifle company. Oh, that's good, sir. Sir? My girl here's been asking to go to gandwara with me in the cab. If you were to order her to go on military duty, No one to say no, eh? You want to go to gandwara? Well, consider yourself so ordered. You didn't have time to change in uniform. But as soon as Bhowani Junction lay behind her, She was up against the same problem: Her guilt was still with her. The heat in the cab was 130 on the flats And 167 inside mene tunnel. It knocked the last of the fight out of her. I must hurry, I've got to take the local back to Bhowani, And you better go get yourself a seat, the train's packed. Can't tell you how pleased I am about... That other thing. It would have been all wrong. You found it out for yourself, didn't you? Can't you find a place? Come in here. I couldn't do that, sir. You can hardly stand. There's a compartment I can use, Come on, get in. Hey. Go in there and take a wash, Make you feel better. Towel's a bit wet. Well, you still look as if you've been under a steamroller, But you're clean at any rate. Say when. When, sir. When are you going to stop playing fast and loose With your wack-eye comMission? I don't know what you mean, sir. Stop calling me sir. You're not a chambermaid, are you? Answer a question honestly. I suppose I can't call you a traitor to your king and country Because you'll flourish that beautiful new sari And tell me that king george is not your king And this is not his country. I haven't been a traitor. I... What's the use? I didn't know what to do. I was sick of being a half-breed, I wanted to belong somewhere... So I... Tried to become an Indian. I found I couldn't change myself. Everything went wrong. Murder is wrong. It wasn't murder. They died. Somebody killed them. Who died? What do you mean? Those people at the train wreck at bothoda. You saw some of them die, didn't you? That's why I made you come up there. I knew you'd been lying about Davay. I've always known. You know something about him. But I killed captain McDaniel. Tell me. I killed McDaniel in the yards... There was a train passing, and it puffed steam over us. He was trying to rape me. He was a maniac, choking me to death, so I killed him. But you led him on. I didn't! Yes, you did, I saw you. The day we arrived on the station stairway, You backed yourself into him. I didn't! He put his hands on me, that's what happened! He was always doing that, But I never complained, because I knew you'd think I should do what he wanted, Because I'm a chee-chee! I killed him with a piece of steel Because he was trying to kill me! Govindaswami was sure you'd done it. Why didn't Govindaswami arrest me? Because he knew you'd find out for yourself That the sadani and Davay weren't the best friends You or even ranjit could have. When that happened, you could help him - a lot. I didn't know the man at the sadani's house was Davay. He called himself Ghanshyam. It was he who buried McDaniel. I couldn't help thinking McDaniel got what was coming to him. But when that innocent sentry was murdered by Davay, I... I felt I'd done it. I tried to bury my guilt by becoming a sikh, But Davay made it worse. May I have a drink, sir? You're half-drunk already. You sure you want another? Yes, please. And a cigarette. Even a cigarette tastes better... Now that it's all out. Well, tomorrow is another day. Morning. You managed to get a few hours' rest. Why I had to tell you of all people... I need to have my head examined. I presume you remember everything you said? Yes. Do you want to retract any of it? What use would that be now? Who is that for? You. Why, because it works as a lie detector? No, because it's the hair of the dog that bit you. What will the charge be, murder? Last night you told me it was self-defense. Last night I expected you to believe me. I did. Would you sooner I didn't? It's just... I didn't expect it, that's all. You'll have to make a clean breast of everything, you realize that? You won't be able to shield the sadani or ranjit. I didn't mention ranjit last night, or his mother. Well, they didn't kill McDaniel. You didn't kill the sentry. If you tell the truth, I'll stand by you all the way. You're not McDaniel's first victim, you know. He used to make a specialty of anglo-Indian girls who couldn't fight back. Why should you stand by me? You're not an Anglo-Indian. You're an officer under my command. Sir? Mmm? I... All these weeks I've known you, This is the first time I've realized There's a human being inside you somewhere. Oh, he's still there, is he? Good. Then there's hope for us all. The complication in the case against Victoria Was the tie-up with Davay and his communist fifth column. If the finding of the court of inquiry went against Victoria, She would go before a general court-martial. I threw an emergency cordon around the town To keep Davay from escaping before we could hunt him down... And then Govindaswami arrested the sadani. You see, even those misguided fools out there are on my side- And what does my enlightened son do? He sits at home and broods about his girl and his religion While his mother goes to jail. As long as you shield Davay, I can never take your side. I'm sorry, mother. Ah! Weakling! It is this girl who has informed against us. She is a jackal, like the rest of her breed, A lackey of the British... But she shall pay for it. Mother, if you harm her, you will never see me again. For Victoria, it was an exhausting and nerve-racking business, But the court of inquiry concluded its work, and a finding was reached. You're a free woman again, subaltern Jones. Open-and-shut case of self-defense. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. Now, now, don't spoil it all. After standing up to it this far in the best stiff-upper-lip tradition? I'm just... Unwinding. Well, come and unwind over a whisky and soda. I'll unwind with you. May I have perMission to thank you, sir? PerMission granted. Well, perMission granted indefinitely. Let's go and get the drink. Oh, sahib, you have come to the wrong place, This is restaurant hindu, nonvegetarian. That's right, now we are hindu and nonvegetarian, And we're hungry, and we want wine to drink to The early departure of the British. Ha ha ha! Yes, sahib. I don't understand his dialect. He says that mrs. Sahib Jones Should marry the colonel. Oh, well, I... He says you must: You make his heart big And you give him many heroic sons. You going to give me many heroic sons? Look. "to the memory of joanna, "beloved wife of captain rodney Savage, "13th rifle wing of native infantry... Died on the 10th of may, 1857." Rodney, I didn't know. My great-grandmother. Killed in the mutiny. So you see, in a way, I'm as much a part of India as you are... Up till now, anyway. What do you mean? I have to report to camberley when this shindig's over. It's like going back to school again, except with any luck I should come out the other side a full-blown general. Camberley... In England? Yes. You had any... Particular hankering to see England? Yes, once. Oh, who's the young lady in the oversized chapeau? That's Dunphy's little girl. And that's her father's train. When I was her age, I used to wait just there for pater to come by, And I'd pretend that I was on that train on my way to Calcutta... And then on a great ocean liner to England. As I drew near, the entire population of the British isles Would line up on the white cliffs of dover to welcome me back home, And the king and queen would come on board in person to escort me ashore. That's more than they do for me. And then one grows up. What I'm trying to tell you is that... It would be very easy for me to try to escape again, Into your world this time. And only children can escape from reality. I'm trying to learn to face up to it. To reality? Do you want to know something? The only people who face reality Are the ones who are too dumb to duck when they see it coming. I mean, let's enjoy ourselves and be happy for a while. If that's the way you want it. Is that the silence of criticism or content? I'm trying to remember the exact section Of the army act we've just broken. Oh, why bother. Between us, we've broken the lot. Oh, no, not all of them. Well, if you can think of any others, you just let me know. We might as well be hanged for sheep as a lamb. Miss Jones? Wake up, please, Miss Jones. Do not make any noise, please, Miss Jones. Now, listen carefully. I'm indifferent to whether you live or die, Miss Jones, personally. There are causes which cannot be counted in terms of life or death. My cause, for example. If you please, do as I tell you. Get dressed... As quickly as possible. You'll wear this one, Miss Jones. Your Colonel Savage is a most efficient officer. There are military patrols surrounding the city. Since it was you who told him who I was, I've chosen you to help me escape. You'll do as I tell you. Come here. Do as I say, Miss Jones. He knows you. He'll stop in spite of regulations. I'll be concealed but right behind you. Victoria, I thought it was you. What's the matter? I thought pater was driving this train. I- Dungood's train? You should know better. Oh, I'm sorry, ted. Bhowani? Yeah. That train, is number 6 down? What was it stopping for? It was stopped at the back of the Jones house. I saw a woman in a red dress. She talked to Dunphy. I couldn't see it. There was a man with her. Well, she must have got on the train. Lie down. No, here. If the train is searched, Do not move or make any kind of sound. I- I can't breathe. You can as long as you keep quiet. Savage? Savage! Savage! Is she here? I've got to know! If she was, do you think I'd tell you? You'll have to take my word for it, Taylor. Now clear off. I see. Then I- I'm in love with her, too, you know. I know you are. I'm glad she's safe. Wait a minute. What did you come here for? A wild-goose chase. A girl in a red dress was seen with a man getting on a train... Train? What train, blast you? It happened behind her house. Victoria has a red dress. We can head them off at the dover checkpoint. It's too late. Further on... We'll Miss them there. I'll phone and have a platoon ready to move. Won't be a minute. Now, be very still. They will slow up for the mene tunnel. If we're quick, we can head them off. We should be seeing it soon now, colonel. Be thankful that I'm only gagging you Instead of killing you, Miss Jones. By the time they find you, Indian history will have been changed. You'll remember this day forever. Quick! Before it goes in the mene tunnel. We'll get it the other end. Dunphy! Dunphy! Stop, I tell you! What is wrong? This one's open, colonel. Quick! Victoria! Victoria? Vicki! Victoria! Victoria? Patrick, she's here. It's all right, darling. It's all right. Davay. Davay! Yes, where'd he go? Where- It must have been the mene tunnel. It slowed. He had explosives! Quick, colonel! The afternoon special... Due here in 20 minutes. Can you manage? Dunphy, full speed ahead! Hold the troop special until further notice. There may be dynamite under the track in the mene tunnel. Go ahead. Get going. Back to the truck. Mushim, drop 4 men off at the near end to the tunnel. They're to shoot anyone coming out on sight. The rest of you follow me to the far entrance. Cover us. Hey. I'm not lucky, colonel. If I go with you, you'll not catch him. Well, I am lucky. Come on. Put that light out! But the train- Don't be a fool. The troop train's safe. But there's a passenger special due in 4 minutes. Let go of me. I'm the railway man here. Put that torch out! Dynamite. Dynamite! Are you badly hurt? Where'd he get you? Dynamite! The special- I heard a whistle. Come on. Come quick. Let's get you off the rail. That's right. That's right. Come on. Oh! I'll flag the train down. They're sure to have a doctor aboard. I hope he's an undertaker, too. Oh, don't be a fool. You're not gonna die. Yes, I am. A rather silly place to die. Oh, Savage... Tell Victoria... One thing I didn't bungle was- Yes, I will. Gandhi. Now I knew why Davay had risked everything to wreck that train. For a few minutes, the destruction of the whole of India Had been in his own two hands. "You will report senior officers course Staff College Camberley immediately on arrival in England." Aren't you glad we never let ourselves Forget that this would arrive one day? And now it's here. Will you miss me? More than I'll ever miss anyone. Then that's the only reality. And you were never going to run away from reality again, remember? That's not fair. Victoria... Come to England with me as my wife. I... I can't. Because you're afraid? The English aren't going to eat you alive, you know. It's not because I'm afraid. It's because I don't belong there, Not even as your wife. I belong here, not as a phony Indian, not as a phony white, But as myself. You know it. It's about time the lord started making all human beings The same on the outside as well as the same on the inside. We'd only change it back again the moment his back was turned. Wish I could quarrel with that. Oh, darling... Victoria, marry me. Don't be a fool. Marry me. No, no... It wouldn't work. It wouldn't work. Supposing I were to get out of the army and come back here. Would you still refuse to marry me? Just for my sake? I wouldn't let you. Where else do I belong? The only roots I have are wherever you are. Supposing I was to get out of the army and come back here for good. Would you marry me then? Oh, darling... I'd even buy the ring. Are you still of the same mind? Retirement? I'm just counting the days, sir. It'll mean a long wait, unless... I might be able to pull a string or two And get you moved up on the list. Is that possible? I'd say it was the least I could do. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
