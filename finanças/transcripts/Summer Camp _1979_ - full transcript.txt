As you know this is a summer camp, a run-down summer camp. Now the function of summer camps is to give young people the opportunity to experience outdoor living. The main function of this summer camp is to make money. Now if you took a good look around you will observe that there are no young people here. The Camp Malibu is in trouble. You mean they're gonna close down the camp? No no no no, not unless I have to. But I have a plan, and I need everybody's help. I have here a list of influential past alumni, I'm gonna invite these kids up here for a weekend reunion, at our expense. That's your plan? I don't get it. I do and I think it sucks. It's very simple Dr. Fox. While they're here, we give 'em a big sob story about the condition of the camp, you know, really lay it on. Tell 'em without their help the camp will fold. We really need their family's financial sup-- I don't think the kids are gonna fall for it. Sure they will because that's part of the plan, we make it fun, competitive, women's lib, boys against the girls, whoever does the best job will win a prize. What kind of prizes? Ah, a certificate of achievement. Be careful, that's liable to break you. Let me congratulate you on your brilliant, but larcenous plan, Herman. Thank you doctor. Now everybody, let's get to work and save Camp Malibu!

All right, hello there, I'm Herman Samuels, can I help you with anything? Uh no, no thank you. All right then just what the hell are you doing? Oh me, looking, just looking. Looking, looking for what? Oh, you know, gold, silver, molybdenum, possibly even oil. You mean here? Uh-huh, maybe, maybe not. One never knows. Just who or what are you? Oh me, I am a geologist.

I'll keep him away don't worry about it. - Hello Mr. Samuels! - Fucking Horse. Tidal wave. Call me Herman, Matt! Glad you decided to come up. We hope that joining our team here's in your future plans. Uh, speaking of my future plans, I... Aren't you in school? Yeah, I'm registered and enrolled and everything, I'm just not really sure what I'm gonna do about... About what? Well I've never really been able to talk about this. I don't know why, I know it sounds silly, but for some reason Herman, I feel I can talk to you. Well I'm glad you feel that way Matt. Well the fact is, I just really don't know what to do with my life, I mean, the path seems so well laid out. College, law school, job waiting, family, marriage, senility. What do you really want? Well that's just it, I don't know. I mean I could get a job, I could travel, I could bum around Europe, the United States. Hell I could even join the Navy or the Army. I just don't know. Well, you seem like a bright young man, I'm sure that whatever you decide will be the right thing. Thanks a lot. I just can't get over how much she's changed. Kim, yeah, she's changed all right. And I have a feeling it means trouble. I'd give anything to look like that. All right girls! I just want to explain a few things to you. First, as some of you are still underage, and I am still responsible for you, there will be no boys, or men, in this cabin, understood? Oh wow. Second, you will be in your beds, alone, by lights-out. Does that mean we can't even fool around with each other? And last, you will keep this cabin neat. There is no maid here, and this especially means the bathroom, okay? Be very careful how you dispose of things. What does she mean, Cindi? - Kotex. - Any other questions? Yeah, do we get milk and cookies before you tuck us in? Real cute Kim. As you were. Boy she hasn't changed much in 10 years. But we have, that's the problem. Yeah will I came up here to have fun, and no biddy's gonna stand in my way. We're all up here to have fun. Well she's only trying to do her job. Yeah, well I don't know about you people, but I'm not about to stay cooped up in this hen house. Ciao. I assume this is my bed. Yours and a bed bag. Very funny. That's exactly what they said about you. Fuck all you guys! - I'm first. - I'll be second! Come on on that's enough, Jesus! I don't understand, the guy doesn't want to be here, what is he doing here? Maybe he's into self abuse. Isn't that when you get hair on your palms? That could be it, we're gonna check his palms for stubble, it could be contagious! Leave me alone! I never wanted to come here ever! They made me! Now I understand, they made him. They made him! Ah well they didn't do a very good job! Why don't you shut up, you fruit! - What did you call me? - You heard me. I ought to put this where the sun don't shine! Nome, Alaska! Civilians out of the way, ya, ya, ya, - ya, ya! - All right all right what is going on, what is this? Why it's a giant dildo. Who does this belong to? A giant, she lives right... - over there! - It's mine! All right guys will you cool it, okay? Will you just cool it! Hey! - Well... - Guys, is this... the right place? AJ Parnelli asshole, how are 'ya? How's the van, sweet-o? Oh it is fine and I am ready for acti-one! For acti-one you've come to the wrong spot. Your bed Master Mike, the very last one, you'll be sleeping on top of Sir Gerald, the jack off. They made him come here! Fuck all of you! Ha, horny son of a bitches. You guys wouldn't believe what happened to me on the way up here. Yeah, try us. Well I picked up this real looker of a hitchhiker, I mean real looker! She had a pair on her that would kill! Anyway she gets in, and I'm riding along minding my own business, and all of a sudden I look over and bingo! She's completely naked! - Oh! - Oh she was a real nympho! - What are you doing? - Watching you. What for? I think you're very sexy, that's what for. Oh shit! I was hoping this wouldn't be one of those weekends. I don't understand. Well every so often we get a group of girls up here and all they want to do is ball the lifeguard. It's getting to be a joke. I can assure you it's no joke. I hope whoever is responsible for this is satisfied! Did someone think to go get George? No of course not. I'd appreciate you two volunteering, hurry up before it gets worse, go on! - Go on, go on! - All right, all right! I hope we don't get caught! - Chicken? - No. Hey guys, have you seen George? No. Gee what a coincidence. Matt here was just talking about you two. - I bet. - Hey, you don't have to believe me, ask him. Yeah that's right, I was just telling him about the two foxy chicks I saw. I'm Cindi this is Jenny. Hi there I'm Ricky. Would you two lovely ladies like to join us for a walk and maybe... Gee we'd like to but we really do have to find George. See you around. Wow! It looks like we're in luck! Wow, what a swell looking girl. Oh shit, here comes Joe! Aw shit, just when I was about to fall in love. Oh, hey Joe, what's happening? Oh nothing, what, what's happening with you? Oh not much, well there is something. Uh, it's sort of hard to talk about but uh, I think I can feel real comfortable talking to you. Really, w-well I'm glad you feel that way. Well it's just that I don't know what to do with the rest of my life. You're crazy I could lose my job for one thing. It ain't much but I enjoy it. Don't worry, I'm not going to tell. Well that's because there isn't gonna be anything to tell. Aw now do I turn you off that much? Aw, now don't go getting your... - hopes up. - Excuse me, uh, have you seen George? - He's not here! - I know where he is, I'll take you to him. Bye! Whoo George, can I be next? Please be gentle George! May I please have your attention. Now please be reminded that our lavatory system here is only suited for normal use. Any abnormal use of the facilities will result in problems. Uh, one more thing, dinner will be in one hour, and there's a misprint on your schedule. Please change that line that reads clothing optional to read, wear whatever you like. And seated right next to him is Dick the lifeguard. Whoo, whoo! Uh, right there is Joe, the boys' counselor. Hey Joe. And Alice, the girls' counselor. If you have any problems you'll find Dr. Fox here in the infirmary. And this is my wife, Sharon. Ah, down, down, down! And Roger! As you know, we've planned a number of the activities you used to enjoy so much as campers, so tonight, we're gonna have a campfire with hot cocoa and marshmallows! Whoopee. Ah, right now, I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank each and every one of you for your presence here this weekend. As I'm sure you're aware, this camp, Camp Malibu, has a long and hallowed tradition. Now the responsibility for keeping that tradition alive has now fallen into our hands. I think he's gonna do that football again. We're now at a crossroads. This could be the final quarter of our last game. What'd I tell 'ya? All that you see here today, all that you've remembered with fondness these past years is in danger of being lost. Now the opponent is formidable, it's apathy! Decay! Lack of support both in terms of numbers and money! Do you want money from us? Now we want you on our team! There are plenty of spots left open on our roster, for you, for your parents, for your brothers and your sisters! You could have my sister for two bucks! For if we don't join together we will lose. We must commit ourselves to the fight. Not only for our own benefit, I think I'm gonna throw up. - Yeah me too. - But for those of... - our children! - You know... - The future generations... - someone, should turn... - when the going gets tough... - him off. - the tough get going. - Ooh, skunk. The future is in your hands. We can't allow our opponent to keep us from our goal, we must drive hard, harder, harder still until we can see the light. Cross that goal line, raise our arms in triumph, and smell the sweet smell of success! Skunk! Look I think he's trying to use us and we shouldn't stand for it. He invited us up here as guests, to have fun, not to work. Well come on, let's look at it from Herman's point of view, I mean, we could be his last hope. We should be selfish and just think of ourselves. Yeah, could be the end of Camp Malibu. How would you live with that on you conscience, Ricky? Horse is right you guys! It won't kill us to help out a little bit. We owe it to him, it's a free weekend. Besides, you guys could use the exercise, and work off some of that baby fat! Oh shit! Well Matt what do you think? Well I think Ricky's got some good points. Oh come on. Although I see where the girls are coming from. Well I don't know, what the hell! What I don't understand is what exactly does Herman want from us? Slave labor. Oh come on Ricky. Do you want this camp to go under, is that really what you want? - Well? - Well I just don't believe him, that's all. I think we ought to have an orgy, dive into some fine... Oh come on be serious! I am serious, orgy, orgy, now, I am already... - taking these off... - Yeah, yeah, oh yeah... oh yeah, oh yeah! Hey would you guys speed it up, I ain't got all night! That's right! There's a full moon out tonight. And you got a date with the Wolfman! I didn't now you liked hairy men. Don't worry I won't cut in on your territory. Well you got me there. If I had my choice, I'd rather bang the Wolfman than you. You couldn't bang a cap gun. Listen I'm gonna be back in about 15 minutes and if this place isn't cleaned up, it's your ass. The only ass you can get is in Tijuana. And then the poor dumb animal has to be strapped down. Let's get this over with, come on. Oh! Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I'm just that kind of sort of thing! Now that's okay, now don't... Is there anything I can do to make up for it? Oh, oh oh oh oh what do you mean? Would you like to kiss me? Now? Oh is there anywhere we can go? - R-R-R-R-Right now? - Yes, yes, before I explode, oh think of some place! - Some place... - Some place! - Some place, some place... - Some place! Some place, some place... I got it, I got it, I got it! - It's very cold. - Don't worry I'm very hot! Yeah right! Oh! Oh help me with my clothes, take my clothes off please! Yes take my clothes off! Harder, harder harder! Right there right there! Yes I love it, love it love it! Oh, take me, take me, take me! Take you where this is all there is! Roger! Rog-- Oh come on, give the guy a break, out! I said out! I hope he gets, whatever. Oh I love it, oh harder, harder! Oh, more, more! - Whoops. - Shit. ♫ Time to relax, where the stars shine in the sky ♫ Time to relax ♫ Alone baby you and I, I-I-I ♫ Time to relax ♫ I'm a city boy and you're a pretty girl ♫ Here in the moonlight ♫ We're together on a country night ♫ Time to relax, there's a message in the breeze ♫ Time to relax, and it's calling me, you and me ♫ Time to relax ♫ I'm-a hoping boy and you're a wishing girl ♫ Here in the moonlight ♫ We're all alone on a country night ♫ Out here no words need to be spoken, oh no-o-o ♫ I can see it all in your eyes ♫ Tonight, yeah while the trees are sleeping ♫ You and I will be promise keeping Hey, let's say you and me have our own private little party.

Look, I know you're only trying to do you're camp mother bit but uh, leave me, I've been taking care of myself a long time. Um, I'm sure you have. How about another shot? You had your shot? College, law school, job waiting, family, marriage, senility. Herman, Herman! Not now dear, I've got too much on my mind. You really think so? I guess you're right. Now I feel a lot better about things after talking to you. I'm sure you'll make the right decision. I really think you're right. Having any luck? Sure, sure. That's bullshit. Well? Not really. See those three girls over there? Hey do you know them? It depends on what you mean by knowing. I mean you mean intellectually or carnally or-- Well do you! Nah, but I'd like to. Come on I'll show you the master at work. Hello ladies. This is Mike, my name is Horse. They call me Horse. Would you like to know why they call me Horse? Because they can't call me anything else once they see the size of my here. Right in here, everybody look, everybody looking? So what makes you think I'm interested? A little bird told me. And my, how that little bird is growing! Well let's say you turn me, there's lots of girls that turn me on. - I'll bet. - Listen if you don't stop that I'm gonna come all over my pants here. All right, but that's just a sample. All right, all right, just tell me where you want me and I'll be there. Ah, no, you tell me! ♫ We're together on a country night ♫ Here in the moonlight ♫ We're all alone ♫ On a country night It seems like the things that change, the more things remain the same. - Yeah. - I mean like this weekend it seems like time has stood still. Like we were 10 years, we were 10 years back. - Matt! - What? Will you top talking and kiss me? It's time now to breath! Time back in! - Mm, that's enough! - What do you mean that's enough? Haven't we just started? Uh-uh, bye bye! Bye bye? I don't know. All right. Uh, you guys clean up, I got to dump a load. Holy shit my bed's full of crap! Yeow! What is going on? Sounds like someone's getting... - murdered in here! - Somebody Vaselined the god damned toilet seat! All right, I want everybody in bed right now, and you'll clean up in the morning. Well my bed's full of fucking shaving cream! Well, look at it this way, you'll be able to shave in bed in the morning. All the bed frames are Vaselined! So a little Vaseline never hurt anybody! This is so true you silly savage you! Oh, goodnight! Did you do this? What makes you think I did it? What makes you think I did it! I've been short-sheeted! Ugh! God dammit! I've been short-sheeted too! Goodnight guys. Oh! The girls did this! - What? - The girls did this, I'm positive they did! - What should we do about it? - I'm glad you brought that up! We gotta get back at 'em. - Yeah how? - Panty raid! Yeah! When when when? After that's when! You sound ready, let's do it, let's do it now... - right now! - Hey come on guys guys guys, did I ever tell you about the time that I picked up the stewardess? - Nah. - Great! Well I was flying from San Fran to LA when this creature of incredible beauty comes up to me and she says "Hey, TWA coffee, TWA milk, "or TWA T and that means me!" Shut up. Does this article of bad taste belong to anyone? - Oh sorry! - Well try to keep your dirty laundry off my bed, okay? It was clean until you touched it. Don't you girls have anything better to do than to talk abut me? Oh we weren't saying anything bad! Even if you were, coming from you it wouldn't mean anything. Now wait a minute Kim, if you're gonna pick on anybody pick on me. I wouldn't waste my time. Looking at you broads it's no wonder all the guys are chasing me. That's a laugh! You throw yourself at every guy in this camp! By tomorrow you'll have to go to the butcher for fresh meat! Fuck off! So these two broads and me right, they beg me to drive to this secluded spot where nobody would bother us. And we all get into the back, and uh, well you guys can imagine all the possibilities. You guys want me to describe everything in detail? Are you sure? Hey, where is everybody? Those bastards left without me! Everything under control? Well for the time being, yes. Good, good. - Keep up the good work. - Okay. - Joe. - Yeah, Herman? Yeah, boys' cabin in shape? I guess so. We could all use a nice peaceful evening. Jesus, the whole fucking staff is out there. Look, we gotta create a diversionary tactic or it'll ruin the whole surprise. - We can start a fire! - Yeah we burn the camp down, I like it! Wait! There's this trash can over there, if we throw this little ruby in there, whoof, the explosion should distract them long enough! - Any... - Yeah! - volunteers? - Hey, you bastards left me! Yeah it was a defensive tactic, you were boring us to death, go away, go away! - You sure? - Kidding! Does Dolly Parton sleep on her back or what? He's a brave kid isn't he? Charge! Come on girls, let's get 'em! Damn you, you beast, you beast! Hold it, hold it! Hey what's going on in here? Ah, ah ha, I like it, it's me! Hey George! George! Hey George! George! Ha! I don't think that was very funny! What's all the noise up in the camp? Oh some of the boys are getting their rocks off with a panty raid. Oh yeah? Aren't you a little afraid of losing your panties? No, because I never wear them! Oh yeah? Oh! Oh... Oh yeah! Okay is everybody ready? - Yep. - Uh-huh. - Come on! - Cindi are you sure we ought to be doing this? Muffy, if we only did the things we ought to do life would be awfully boring. Let's go! - All right! - Yeah! Yeah! Oh come on! Yeah! George! Hey let's get out of here! Oh no let's have round two! Not now! Well why if we get caught I'll just tell him it was me who raped you! Very funny, put this on and get your ass out the window! Boy you sure know how to ruin a good time. Hey we're gonna have to do this again some time. Yeah well don't count on it. Oh Georgie, you forgot something! Ha! - What are you doing in here? - Why I'm working. Yeah I bet you were working, and I know who you were working on! - You do? - Yeah! Look at that, boy I want what's inside here, hey I want it I want it! Oh, and look at this, look, who could fit into this! Can you believe it? Hold it, hold it! These are my shorts, I lost it... - You are a pervert! - Sorry, I'm sorry! Let's get 'em! Cut it out! This is so cold! May I please have your attention! The schedule for this morning is as follows. Calisthenics at the main athletic field in 10 minutes. Everyone is expected to participate. Breakfast comes next, followed by group leadership training projects. Uh, one more thing. Will anyone who has in his possession the under, the panty, the uh, uh, please return all items of clothing not your own to a table that's been set up under the totem pole so the rightful owners may claim their property. And so in keeping with the themes of this weekend, commitment, leadership, responsibility... - Here it comes again. - we've created a leadership training activity designed to reinforce your pride in your surroundings. Not only that, but also pride in accomplishment. Now each staff member will call out the names on his or her list, and the group that does the best job will win a prize! Probably another glorious weekend in Camp Malibu. Yeah and second prize is probably a whole month. I'm not real sure I understand what we're supposed to do. I'm afraid they're gonna put us to work. - Well guys? - No way! Hey listen to me, I got some real hot news! We the men of cabin two are having a little contest of our own, I already have here let's see 10 people signed up, that's $1 per person, winner take all! What do we gotta do? We'll refer to it as the fantastic feces contest. Uh, I don't get it. You will my dear, the rules are very simple, the longest one wins and it's gotta be in one piece. And with Bertha's food already our stomach we can expect some real whoppers! Who wants to sign up? I still don't get it. Stupid. And so since all work and no play make us all very dull, fun is the order of the day for the rest of the afternoon! Oh boy, can't wait to here this one. Now the staff and I have organized a series of contests... - in which... - Speaking of contests... - who's winning? - So far Horace is. But just by a fraction of an inch. And to add to the spice of the proceedings, the two teams will be, the boys against the girls! Yeah, I wouldn't mind being up against her! The contests consist of various athletic and non-athletic events! How can we be expected to compete against the boys? I don't know, but it could be fun. Okay everybody, let the competition begin! Good evening ladies and gentlemen, this is your announcer, Herman Samuels, inviting you to join us for the first annual Camp Malibu Competition Games! This event not only attracts multitudes of great athletes who have at one time or another rose. But also throngs of rabid spectators, each of whom has asked me for my autograph! And to break the tie the judges have decided the final contest will be a flag football game. The rules are simple. The boys must pull off both the girl's flags while the girls merely have to touch the boys with one hand! Give me a G, give me an I! Come on at me baby doll I'm ready! Give me an R! Give me an L! I don't care which one gets it, come on I'm ready for more! Give me an L! Girls! Three, six, nine, hike! - Side run. - Yeah you got me! Come on man, yeah! Ah, what's the strategy?

Okay you guys we gotta win this thing! You gotta be kidding, they're not gonna let us win! Trust me, the first thing we gotta do is work on our on-side kick! What's an on-side kick?

You hear me? Ready? - Ready, break! - Yeah! Kind of go easy stuff now, right now! Now that we got the ball, what do we do with it? This will probably be the last play of the game girls. Okay now listen, we're gonna run a triple reverse! Are you out of your mind? Probably. Ready? - Break! - Go! Let's go guys, beat the shit out of 'em! Hey old duck, hey old ducks, come on, shoo! - Oh doctor? - Yes? Oh doctor, I'd really appreciate if you can check out my ankle, I think I sprained it! - Here? - No! The infirmary! Oh, oh, oh. Now tell me, how long have you been having these pains? Over a half an hour! Don't be a bad sport, cheer up! - Or what? - Maybe for me. The competition isn't over, yet. - What do you mean? - Hey Ricky, get in here! Terry's about to make history! I'll bet the Guinness World Book of Records has nothing like this on its hands! Well. Oh I just love the way this feels against my naked body! Well, tell me now, where's that problem? Oh you see doctor I uh, I've got this itch, and nobody I know has been able to scratch it, yet. Well uh, have you tried calamine lotion? No, have you tried this?

And the theme for the disco will be, Nights of Arabia! And what does that mean? Everyone will have to improvise some sort of costume, within the bounds of good taste. And the winners will receive a, uh, receive a prize so fabulous I can't tell you what it is! Yeah probably the same prize he forgot to award at lunch. Muffy you take the spaghetti, you take the punch, Jenny the pie, ready? All right. Hey what's going on... Hey guys, how's it, how's it going? We're getting there. I like 'em bareback!
