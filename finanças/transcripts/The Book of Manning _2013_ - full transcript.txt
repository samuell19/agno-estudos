Archie Manning, former NFL quarterback, patriarch. Peyton and Eli, also NFL quarterbacks, both boys number one draft picks, back to back Super Bowl champions and MVPs. The Manning story seems so surreal that it reads like a fairy tale. For them to be number one picks in the draft, win Super Bowls and MVP, yeah we pinch ourselves. We just tried to raise kids, we tried to raise good kids and have a good family. I don't like the perception that it was a plan, that I was an NFL quarterback for awhile. And now, I've got these boys and I'ma mold them into being NFL quarterbacks, not so. Even if I can do that and they might be an NFL quarterback, I'm not sure you're gonna have a great father, son relationship. That's what I wanted. [John] Fatherhood took precedence over football. A strong sense of family was ingrained in his upbringing. Elisha Archibald Manning, Archie was born May 19th, 1949 in Drew, Mississippi, the only son to parents Cis and Buddy. As a boy, Archie yearned for closeness to his father. Common ground was found in football. And my dad was a football fan. We'd watch some football. Anybody from Mississippi who played professionally, he liked that team. And he loved Mississippi, loved Mississippians. And remember watching games every Sunday. My dad was a New York Giants fan, and we didn't get them on TV a lot. So, that was a big thrill if we ever get to see the New York Giants. And the reason he was a Giants fan, there was a quarterback, back in the '50s, number 42 from Ole Miss named Charlie Conerly, and my dad loved Charlie Conerly. Therefore, we followed the Giants. I think Archie wanted to be closer to his dad than he was. But his dad was a little bit distant in that regard, and he did have trouble telling his kids he loved them. You didn't hug in those days like we do now. I don't think a lotta dads told their kids they loved them. I'm sure his father loved him as much as any father does. It's just men at that time did not show demonstrative affection. He was a tough guy. And I think he was a good influence on my work ethic, In 13 years, I had never missed a day of Sunday school. I tried to make good grades so I could be Valedictorian. [birds chirping] [John] In the 1950s, Drew, Mississippi was a farming community of only a few thousand. A slow paced, one stop light town in the delta. Yet at the time, Drew had more cotton gins than anywhere in America. [Archie] My dad was in the farm machinery business, farming community, cotton was big back in those days. First job I remember we could go, what we call chop cotton. We made $3 a day, that's what you made for chopping cotton, was $3 a day. In the summer, he worked for a friend of ours father, and they laid bricks. Oh, labor, labor for a brick layer, which meant we hauled bricks. It was really hot, long hours, five hours in the morning, go to lunch, couple of hours in the afternoon, then go to baseball. [birds chirping] He was starting short stop for Drew High School in the eighth grade and he wasn't out there because they needed somebody to put in the spot. He was the best on in the area to play the position. [John] Archie excelled at baseball, but his first love was football. A love shared by his father. [Archie] My dad loved Ole Miss, he loved Mississippi. That really became my dream to be an Ole Miss quarterback. But I was real thin. Archie was skinny, he was skin and bones and freckles. When we say skinny, we mean skinny. When you're six three and 160 pounds, you're skinny. Not much of a football body, but it will surprise you to see -what a great athlete he was. -[dramatic music] He could not only throw the ball, but he could run that football too. I wasn't that fast but I was the fastest one there in Drew for a while. I didn't have but three offers but one of 'em was Ole Miss. We didn't let him know we wanted him that badly. In fact, we sent a student assistant down to sign him after his last ball game. So, he wasn't hard to sign. [Archie] Some people probably said, maybe you shouldn't do that because Coach Vaught signed a lot of quarterbacks, and he would change them to other positions. So there were eight my year, eight quarterbacks signed to go play freshman football at Ole Miss. [John] Baseball came calling. Archie was drafted out of high school by the Atlanta Braves. Doubting the Ole Miss decision, he looked for guidance. [Archie] Thinking I might change my mind, my dad really helped me there. He kinda just said, "You know, you gotta do "what your heart tells you to do." And I wanted to go to Ole Miss. -[dramatic music] -[birds chirping] In those days, the things were so different, you played freshman football. And so, you could also sign 40 people, but you didn't play but four games. So, that's like three weeks of practice in between games, you were really doing fundamentals of -a lot of tackling. -[whistle blowing] Kinda the job of the freshman coaches, get those numbers down a little bit. And we had a great freshman coach, legendary guy named Warburg Davidson. He kinda had a way of communicating with 18 year olds. Guy is holding his knee, big, sharp piece of his leg bone sticking through the skin, blood going everywhere. "Son, what's the matter with you?" "Oh, coach my leg's broke, my leg's broke." "How you know it's broken, are you a doctor?" "Matcher, come and get this man out of the way. "All right, let's go, line 'em up, keep running. "Don't worry, you're not gonna die, "you pass out before you die." If you could make it through Warburg Davidson, you could run barefooted and naked through hell and you wouldn't even be sunburned when you came out on the other side. [Archie] It was tough, every day was a gut-check. First time we got to go home, a lotta guys didn't come back. And I can't say I didn't think about it. [John] Manning persevered. At quarterback, he was the last man standing. -[crowd cheering] -[dramatic music] Archie engineered an 80 to eight victory over Vanderbilt. Head Coach Johnny Vaught took notice. And in an historic move, Archie was named the starting quarterback his sophomore season in 1968. [Archie] In all the quarterbacks he'd had, he'd never started a sophomore, never started a sophomore, and I was gonna be the first sophomore quarterback. I was thrilled, probably a little scared. -This is big boy football. -[dramatic music] [John] Behind center, Archie showed off a skill set seldom seen in quarterbacks at the time. One thing that caught the imagination of everybody back then was that he could run and he could pass so well. Not many quarterbacks in that era could do both as well as Archie could. Pass protection would break down, and Archie would reverse field on a rollout, head the other direction. He might even give ground, then wind up completing a pass. It was amazing the way that he could escape pressure. Archie just, he put on a show, man, he just did. He ran everywhere and through everywhere. When a fellow starts out to the right, and gets boxed and turns back to the left, and then throws it back to the right, that gets you attention. He worked, and worked and worked all the time to build up his body, learn flip balls, study tapes. He would leave the dorm after lunch and study film for hours before practice. We knew that as long as he was in our huddle, we had a chance to win every ball game. Archie Super Manning is what they called him. [John] Archie's heroics won games and won over fans. Playing with reckless abandon, he led the Rebels to seven wins his sophomore season. [Commentator] And Archie Manning, about the coolest article we've seen this year at quarterback. [John] Archie was a multi sport athlete, playing baseball for Ole Miss in the College World Series that year. On campus, he attracted attention easily. [Olivia] I knew who he was, and I knew he was quarterback at Ole Miss. It was a fraternity, sorority mixer. We called them swaps back then but it was a mixer. And so, I met him there, danced, talked and I could talk football. We just had a lot in common, both of us from small Mississippi towns. Well, I thought she was beautiful, started dating and eventually fell in love. [John] He had glory and he had the girl. Archie seemingly had it all. The summer before his junior year, he headed back home to Drew a hero. Kinda rolling along, playing college football, and enjoying life and all of a sudden, bam. I was just home from summer school. I was gonna be there may be just a couple of weeks 'fore we had to go back and start practicing. My mother and my sister and I, we'd gone to a wedding. My dad, he'd stayed home and was, "I'ma go home." And Archie got home first and found my father. And he had taken his life. [John] Archibald Buddy Manning died on August 16th, 1969 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The burden weighed heavy on his only son. I was the one who found him, and was able to kinda get things together where my mother and sister didn't walk in on that. My dad, he had some stress because business wasn't as good for him, and you have bad years and people don't pay their bills. It was really brutal for Archie and it was stunning, and it was one of those things that given the circumstances where his son was possibly gonna be the All American quarterback, it was a little, well I don't guess you can ever figure things like that out, but that certainly made that all the more difficult. [Archie] I never got angry 'cause I really contributed to health, bad health and just a weak time in his faith. And I think just at a low point, low point in his life, at that point he took his life. Archie lost his dad and he was gonna quit school, come back and get a job and try to help his momma. What are we gonna do? I don't have to go back to school, I can get a job. We weren't a wealthy family by any means. He felt like I'm sure, to offer that was what he needed to do to be the man of the family. In her wisdom, she thought it would be best for him to get back to school and get back to this football season that was so eagerly anticipated. We had an opportunity to have a very good football team. But without him, that wasn't gonna happen. I had to go right back to school after that, and that was pretty tough. Having Olivia during that time in my life was really, really important. We got really pretty serious after that. Oh, it was just such a difficult time. That was just the worst situation. Here he was getting ready to start his junior year, and life shouldn't always be about football, but it was a big year coming up. And he went right back to school. I think it was really hard on him to leave his mother and sister behind. Came home as a sophomore fixing to go into his junior year, focused on getting ready for next football season, and then you go through something like that, and that was really kind of a turning point. [Archie] Going back to school, I had some tough nights up at Ole Miss, kinda missing my mother and my sister, and thinking about them. Trying to concentrate on football, I needed to handle all that. And I was playing a team sport, and I'm not sure I was yet a man. And I felt like I had to be a man. [chattering] [John] Just a few days after his father's suicide, Archie Manning was back at school. The expectations going into that season were that he was gonna be a really good player, and the team was gonna be really good. Then comes the tragedy with his father, and then you have to wonder, gee, -[dramatic music] -how does a kid his age handle something that traumatic? That was the great unknown. One of the great strengths of leaders is the ability to compartmentalize. Archie was able to compartmentalize. He had a personal life, he had a football life, and he dealt with that very well. [John] In football, he found solace. Ahead was a game at Alabama with historic significance. We were pretty excited about it, even all summer when we saw it on the schedule, because it was gonna be on national TV at night. [Ray] It was one of the first prime time, nationally televised college football games. And that was when Archie Manning was really introduced to the national audience. [crowd cheering] [Commentator] Oh, he's like a thoroughbred racehorse. [John] Archie threw for 436 yards and ran for 104 more. A college record for total yards that stood for more than four decades. That night, the Rebels fell short. But the legend was born. Very entertaining game. I guess the game kinda put me on the map. -[dramatic music] -I got 5,000 pieces of mail the next week. It kinda jump started what was gonna be a pretty eventful football season. The next week, we beat undefeated national A few weeks later, we beat undefeated national ranked LSU. About two weeks after that, we were getting ready to play undefeated, national ranked Tennessee. They beat us 31, nothing the year before. They're headed to the Orange Bowl if they beat us, maybe even National Championship. A lot of bulletin board talk. There was some media people that were asking a linebacker at Tennessee, Steve Kiner, about Ole Miss. And the sports writers said, "Well, they got a lot of horses down there," and Kiner was alleged to have said, "Well, you guys don't know the difference "between a horse and mule." And then, there was a mention of Archie Manning, and Kiner allegedly said, "Archie who?" What do you mean, "What do I think of him?" We beat 'em my sophomore year, we beat 'em my junior year. Archie who, who's Archie, what's the big deal about him? I don't know who he is, he's not anybody to speak of. I'm the one that stuck my foot in my mouth, and God knows, -I regret having said that. -[dramatic music] [Commentator] It's first down for the Rebels, Manning to the left, cocks his arm, he throws the home run, he's open at 15, to the 10, to the five, out of bounds on the three yard line. -Roy Frank catching the ball. -[crowd cheering] An unbelievable football game for an inspired bunch of Ole Miss Rebels. Touchdown for Archie Manning. And it was our day, we beat 'em 38, nothing. They just beat the snot out of us. You couldn't rattle him, couldn't get under his skin. It's very humbling when you get beat like we got beat. Archie, he came along, kind of more in popular culture. At a time when not much was going right for Mississippi, because of the problems with Meredith in 1962. [dramatic music] [Robert] Mississippi, for as long as anybody can remember, has been dealing with poverty, illiteracy, of course race. Mississippi last in literacy. Mississippi first in obesity. You beat on somebody with that long enough, they begin to think that's who I am, I can't read and I'm too fat. You could celebrate excellence in the life of Archie Manning, who personified the qualities that all of us would like to have. His photograph was so American. Here's this kid with red hair and freckles. He's got a straw coming out of his mouth, and you turn the page, Archie. [dramatic music] That's who he became, Archie. There was no more Archie Manning. The only experience that we had that resembled what happened to Archie was Elvis Presley, and he wasn't quite at the same level as Elvis. But in our world, he was. I was a little embarrassed about it and I had been taught, beginning with my dad, that football is a team game. But I got a lot of individual attention. At first, I didn't like it, I was afraid of the way that maybe the other teammates would accept it, what they would think about it, but they kinda took it on as a joke and made a joke with me, and playing around with me, I didn't mind it too much. I felt like he always had tremendous composure. -He didn't strut around, -[dramatic music] he wasn't cocky, he just had a good sense of who he was and how he fit in where he was. [John] Archie led the Rebels in passing and rushing that season. And with a seven and three record, Ole Miss earned a berth in the Sugar Bowl on New Year's Day. [Commentator] Start of the second quarter. -[crowd cheering] -[commentator laughing] Oh, the amazing Archie Manning. Oh, that's a load, Manning throws... Archie Manning, another 80 yard drive. This one seven play, Manning who has broken all of Charlie Conerly's Mississippi records. Man has had a ballad written about him and for him, "Archie who?" Well, here at the Sugar Bowl, they already know about number 18. [John] Archie once again amazed in front of a national viewing audience. With the win, he was named Sugar Bowl MVP. Yet Archie longed for more. He really didn't say a lot about it... [sighs] He would just say, "I wish my dad was here to see this." I thought about him a lot, how much he would have enjoyed that we had some huge wins, some exciting games, and probably the best year I ever had in football, the fall of 1969. I wish he could have seen that and missing my dad, that was pretty tough. [John] As the SEC player of the year in 1969, Archie Manning was the Heisman favorite his senior season. Ole Miss had a perfect four and oh conference record headed into the homecoming game, where Archie's fiance Olivia was the queen. But the celebration turned somber. [Commentator] Sets the scene down, Manning rolls to the right, Manning's under heavy pressure, side steps to the right, throws the ball way down field, scrambles for it, incomplete at the 40 yard line with two flags on the play between the 40 and the 25. And Manning is hit and hit down hard after the play, and he's not getting up, he's hurt. I was the first one to him, and it was clear that his arm was broken, there was, you could tell his arm was broken, there was no doubt about it. When he went to the sidelines with that broken arm, it just really took the wind out of our sails. [Robert] That stadium went dead silent. And you felt this collective depression setting in over the stadium. The Mississippi team without him couldn't keep winning. They sort of fell off the pace. Any chance he had of winning the Heisman that year was over, the day he went down against Houston. Everybody pretty much at that point figured his season and his college career was over. It was my left arm and my forearm, just figured if we can rig up a cast where I could kinda keep my elbow, then I could maybe play. [John] Archie Manning returned. [Man] What grit does this guy have? What type of tough guy is this? You sit around, you lay around, but this guy was playing a football game with a broken arm. [Commentator] Cast and all, Archie races into Auburn's end of the field. And Archie Manning keeps it alive, fighting the Tiger two yard line. [crowd cheering] It's Manning taking the ball over to get Mississippi on the scoreboard. You could tell that he was gonna give every, every bit of energy that he had to help his team win this game. [Commentator] Manning has decided to carry the football himself. And you know what that means, excitement. -[dramatic music] -[crowd cheering] Here's famous number 18, rolling to the more difficult side to throw from but Manning is on target for a touchdown. How about that Archie Who? [John] Archie totaled 275 yards and two touchdowns. It wasn't enough. Yet, even in defeat, he was far from defeated. I was glad my career didn't end, college career didn't end right there with a broken arm against Houston. The fact that had he played is pretty remarkable, because he had a pro career waiting. [John] Archie was chosen by the Saints as the second overall pick in the 1971 NFL draft. He and his new bride headed to New Orleans to begin a new chapter. At the time the Saints were a pretty bad team and organization. So, when Archie came in, he was used to scrambling around, and thank God he was, because he didn't have much protection. He was running for his life half the time. -[upbeat music] -[crowd cheering] "Those boys are chasing me all over the place out here." He says, "I'm running for my life." I worried about his wellbeing. He was taking such beatings, when you're looking and someone comes, and just ear holes you, he would come back to the huddle, beat up, never said a word, never complained. You talk about the physical beating that he took week after week, I think the emotional beating, the internal beating that he took was probably even greater. To be there for 11 years and never have a winning season. And then the next week, he'd be back out there ready to go again. I actually have positive memories. Now, most people look back on it, I think as kinda negative 'cause it kind of lump it all together and say, "You were running for your life "and y'all weren't very good, " true. I kinda always thought I'd go back to Mississippi, so we didn't know how long we'd be here, probably as long as I'm playing football. But then, decided to start a family. -We bought our first house, -[upbeat music] and had Cooper came along about the same time. Really blessed to have a big, healthy child. Two years, later Peyton came along, and so now we had two, and we were so grateful and blessed to have these kids and giving us a lot of joy. When we bought our first house, we had no furniture in the living room. We played knee football. these guys were little. I hated it when we got furniture 'cause it kinda messed up our football game inside. And then, sometimes they'd dress out and put on their equipment. During the season, taking shirt on Saturday mornings, they loved that. I can remember certainly going to Saints practices and Saints games. I spent a lot of Saturdays at football practice with the Saints. I wasn't necessarily trying to expose 'em to it. I was trying to spend time with my kids. I think probably the loss of his father at the early age made Archie so much more appreciative of having time with his own family. And he was gonna do whatever he could to spend time with his sons. He made sure that they know that he loves his boys, and he tells 'em even though his father may have really never said that to him, as least as much as Archie would have cared for him. [Peyton] I think it's a big reason why he has shown so much affection to us I felt like I lost my dad at a young age, but it just, we were so grateful and blessed to have these kids, and I wanted to hug 'em, and I wanted to tell them I loved 'em. He may have taken a real beating that day in a ball game, but he was never too tired to get out in the yard and play with them. [Olivia] He never really brought that home. He would come home and be Dad. And I knew inside he was really hurting 'cause that's difficult week after week to lose those games. I never had a full appreciation for how tough losing is. Dad never brought that home, and I never knew if we won or lost. He made the focus about his kids and not himself. I think a lot of athletes focus on what they do. He did not make his celebrity status as a pro athlete the main focus of family life. He put it on his kids. Hey, Cooper, who is you favorite football player? -Roger Staubach. -Roger Staubach? [woman and Archie laughing] What about Archie Manning? [upbeat music] [Cooper] We wanted to be football players when we grew up. That was the first thing, I guess you kinda wanna be what your dad was. Saturdays, big games, and Dad filmed most of those games, -which was kind of fun. -[child grunting] [Archie] Peyton, you drop back and throw Coop one. You always had to introduce yourself, how old you were and who your favorite team. My name is Cooper and I'm five years old. My favorite team is San Diego Chargers. My name is Peyton, I'm three years old. And my favorite team is Wes Chandler. [Boy laughs] Your favorite team? -Wes Chandler! -[boys laughing] I was three years old, and Cooper was five, and his good friend Richard was six, and somehow the teams ended up those two versus me. No, get, Cooper, you can't grab my shirt! [Peyton crying] -[Archie] No. -[Cooper] Cry baby. -Do it again. -[Cooper] Oh, I'm sorry. You talk about when you're growing up, are you a sore loser? He takes it hard. He could very easily get under my skin, I think and it kinda irritated me. And I'd go complaining to my dad. [Archie] What's the matter, Pey? Pushing from behind, Dad, look. -[Archie] What is it? -Dad, the arm all way down. [Archie] Oh, you'll be all right, Peyton. I think we drove my dad a little crazy how much we argued. -He always used to say, -[upbeat music] "You don't know how lucky you are to have each other. "Brothers are, y'all are supposed to be best friends, "y'all just supposed to be tight. "What are y'all doing fighting all the time?" But we couldn't help ourselves. -We would fight. -[Peyton screaming] Look Peyton, get up, he's killed. I felt like I was just a full time referee. They'd always start playing something in the backyard, basketball, and it would always end up in a fight. -[ring clinking] -Yeah, you had four. They fought a lot, it bothered me for awhile. I just didn't know how much brothers were supposed to fight. [Cooper] We went at it pretty good. Throughout our entire childhood, we weren't very much alike. Peyton was a little more serious, maybe a little more serious about the sports. -[Cooper] Three! -Don't tell me! Peyton was just very intense. When he was very, very small, two, two and a half, three years old, he would wanna show you his drop back, to how he could set up. Cooper always challenged us a little bit. Hi Mom, hi Mom, hi Momma Mom, hi Mom, hi Mom, hi Momma Mom. Yeah, I always like to have a lot more fun and probably didn't take things as seriously as Peyton and my dad do. January 6th, 1981, January-- [Archie] What happened today? We had a baby and I'm excited. [chattering] Eli comes along 5 years later, -[upbeat music] -and so, he's just a lot younger. You gonna talk to me? -What's that? -I remember we found great pleasure in trying to make him cry, -because he wouldn't cry. -[ball bouncing] [Archie] What you got, Coop? Eli, come here. Eli was pretty quiet, had a lot of friends, everybody liked being around Eli, but it almost like Eli didn't even know their names. He did not really concerned with how you were. Very, very, very comfortable in his own skin. and he didn't really act like he cared that much. Five years, it can be a big difference. And as they kinda got into high school and stuff, they were 15 and I'm 10. There was only so much you could have in common. We love sports, that's what we love to do. We love being outside, we love running around. So, whatever sport was in season, I wanted to play it. -[chattering] -[ball bouncing] -[children cheering] -[chattering] [Archie] That's it, buddy. [Eli] All my flag football games growing up, -he always had a video camera. -[whistle blowing] Whatever we chose, he wanted us to go all out. I signed up for musical theater, really to get out of a computer class. They said, "If you're in this class, you will be in the school play." And I was like, "All right, I gotta get out." Kinda my dad's rule was that if you signed up for something, that you had to stay with it, no matter what it was. I guess, once I knew I was gonna be in it, I just said, "If I'm gonna do it, "I might as well go for it." -[audience laughing] -It was the tango, was what it was, and yeah. -[Peyton thumping] -[audience applauding] I think he liked filming special moments. -[dramatic music] -[John] For Archie, his identity was more rooted as father than football player. In 1985, his NFL career was over. A two time pro bowler, he retired without regret. But in 14 years, he never had a winning season. If only he had gone to a team that was better set up to win. In 11 years with the Saints, he had 7 different head coaches. He was a far better player than his record would ever indicate. Didn't see the brightest side of it, but I did it. I played pro football in a great city who supported me. It was a positive experience. [John] In 1986, he came home. [drum thumping] Ole Miss was having Archie Manning day. And his number 18 was to be retired. For the first time, Archie's children could share in their father's college football legacy. I think my dad had just finished playing in the NFL, so it was really his first times going back to Ole Miss games. Seeing how people reacted around him, say, "We love your dad so much." -[chattering] -[drum thumping] I remember before the game, I remember that well. That was a big day and big reception from the crowd. [crowd cheering] I love Ole Miss. I'm very, very grateful for this honor. God bless you and thank you very much. There's a great picture of me and Eli and Cooper, all wearing a different color 18 jersey. The other day I remember, it was a few years after that, they had an alumni game. He was five years retired, some guys much, much older than my dad, in their 60s, out there playing tackle football, which probably wasn't the best idea. -[dramatic music] -I'd never seen my dad in an Ole Miss uniform and I remember being down there on the field watching him kinda scrambling around. [Commentator] Whoop, a fumble on the shotgun, Manning is gonna have to scramble. Let's see if he can still do it, he's back to the 35, he's back to the 30, the 20, back pedaling in trouble. He's back to the 11, gets a block, looks down field, now back to the 25, he's gonna run. He sets up and fires, he's got a man at the 46. [crowd cheering] To midfield, the red team may score. And that brings back some great memories about number 18. That's not the first time he's ever done that. [Peyton] That was kind of an exciting thrill for me, to kinda watching him do his thing like he did years and years ago. Cooper always said, "I wanna be like Archie." And Peyton said, "I want to be Archie." Peyton, I would say his dad was his idol. He was really curious about my college days and interested. Somebody had given him a bunch of the old radio broadcasts on cassette tapes. -I got to listen to the radio -[chattering] and sort of envision what it was like. And yeah, just sit on my bed, and I could kinda picture which way they were going and how he was throwing it. [Commentator] Columbus and Hattiesburg. It's first down for the Rebels, Manning to the left, cocks his arm, he throws the home run, he throws to the 15, to the 10, to the five. Out of bounds on the three yard line, Boy Frank catching the ball. Peyton used to listen to those tapes. And so, he knew who my teammates were and kinda where they were from. [Commentator] Mitchell from Columbus, Coker from Clarksdale, Winter from Biloxi, Jernigan from Jackson and McClure from Hattiesburg. Mitchell from Columbus, Coker from Clarksdale, Winter from Biloxi, Jernigan from Jackson and McClure from Hattiesburg. And those were his offensive linemen. [crowd cheering] [Commentator] And he calls the signals with third and 10, drops back to the left, sets himself, reverses field, and decides to run it. He's here to face the tackle, goes to 10, five, four, three, two, one, touchdown! Beautiful run, beautiful run by Archie Manning. Here's a kid that really was starving to be a quarterback, that admired his dad, that wanted to be just like him, but Archie wouldn't let Peyton play until he was in the seventh grade. He didn't think he should play football until that age and be involved with contact. My football as a child was in the backyard. -[Peyton yelling] -I think that had a big impact on me, just having this real passion for football, -because he kinda held me out. -[chattering] Growing up, that's all we ever wanted to do, was play college football, the pros were just kinda, you kinda sound silly when you're young, and I'm gonna be a pro football player. But trying to get to play college seemed like an attainable goal. In the end, will you through me one normal? I wanted to be playing and be a good player. So, had this great athlete in my house, I said, "Dad, will you come help us?" And of course, he was glad when we asked, but we had to go to him. Well, Archie didn't send his children to a school well known for athletics, it was more well known for studies. [birds chirping] Peyton was my quarterback, and we're in the championship game. And we're up 35 to seven, and it's towards the end of the game. And he's been begging me the whole time, "Coach, let me call a play, let me call a play." I'm like, "All right, Peyton, you can call a play here, but you know we got this game, don't overdo it, okay?" He runs a double reverse pass, it goes for a touchdown. [crowd cheering] And I'm like "Peyton, don't you think that was a little much for the end of the game?" -[Man] Touch down. -Didn't take coaching all that well and I remember one particular game. We lost to a team, Coach said we lost because we didn't execute the game plan. I basically said "No, we lost because you don't what you're doing." And my dad could see me kinda doing that. And he drove me to the coach's house, and had to go up there and apologize. And so, he wanted me to act right and behave. [upbeat music] My sophomore year, Cooper was a senior. That was really the only year we got to play together in football. And Cooper was an established all state receiver, and I was the new starter on the varsity. And yeah, I think it was a great year for my parents, seeing their first two sons out there playing together. [John] The tandem of Manning to Manning proved prolific. Cooper had 73 catches, for 1,243 yards and 13 touchdowns. -[crowd cheering] -[Cooper yelling] That's the most enjoyable fall we've ever had in football. That high school football, you just can't beat that. You wish it could stay like that forever. It's still one of the most fun years that I've had playing football. There was a great connection there. We got to be kinda peers for the first time, as oppose to him just being a little brother. And got to be friends. It made us a lot closer than we probably would have been otherwise. I'm gonna miss it, I always said, wherever I go to college, I want Peyton following me, right behind. I'm gonna miss it too, it's been a lot of fun, and the press is fun too, but the main thing I'm gonna be missing next year is Cooper. He was a good receiver. [John] Cooper accepted a scholarship to his father's alma mater. Archie's eldest son was ready to write his own chapter in the book of Manning. I went off to Ole Miss to play football for the mighty Rebels and I wanted to catch a ball in the last two minutes to beat Alabama one Saturday. -That's all I wanted to do. -Everybody had it planned. He's gonna be the wide receiver, and then Peyton's gonna show up, and then everything's gonna be great [laughs]. Football always takes some funny turns though. -[chattering] -[Man] Number 81, -Cooper Manning. -[Man] You guys finished. [John] In the summer of 1992 Cooper Manning arrived at Ole Miss to continue the family football tradition. But something just didn't seem right. And I really wasn't 100% at Ole Miss. My right hand was kind of, had lost some strengths. I'd had some atrophy in my right bicep. So, my dad and I flew to the Mayo Clinic, had some serious testing, and that's when the message started to kinda come heavy that my football days were not an option. I had what's called congenital narrowing of the spinal canal or spinal stenosis. Literally, I played my whole entire career one hit away from being in a wheelchair the rest of my life. [players thumping] It was a tough time because he, Cooper was the one said, "Dad, I wanna play college football. "I really want to play," it was just hard to sit down and tell your son that that dream was over and he wasn't gonna play anymore football. I remember going back to Ole Miss and being out there on a Friday before a game, and walking into practice with my dad, and I guess the coaches had told the team that I wasn't gonna be, my football career was over. And I remember some old guys, some seniors, guys that should not have cared about a freshman, being really nice, being good to me. I think that even impressed my dad. I think he was a little surprised that these seniors and red... older guys gave a hoot about me. [hands clapping] I think what I miss most about football is the guys. And not winning or losing or catching touchdowns, it was like the locker room, and the bus rides home, that was the good stuff. Cooper handled it so well. We talked about that, kinda that spirit Cooper has. and that attitude and it was, he really made it easier on everyone. [Cooper] Had surgery, somewhere between my freshman and sophomore year and it didn't go great. I had a little blood clot on my spinal cord, and I think the doctors thought for awhile there I wasn't gonna make it. They're going back in and with a blood clot, and we sent for Eli and Peyton to get over to the hospital. And I made it, but I came out and I was not good. I remember going to see him in the hospital, and afterwards, he had his head shaved, and had a six inch scar going down his neck. I had to learn how to walk all over again. I went from a wheelchair to walker to cane, rehab. And all I wanted to do was just get back to school. Tough times to see your little boy going through that. Really had a big effect on Peyton. Peyton was just, didn't think life was fair. By now, they both had this dream to play college football, and maybe play together. And so, that was over. I didn't really know how to handle that. I was a junior in high school, and I knew how much Cooper loved football, and just what football kinda was to our family when you grew up in it. And there was nothing he could do about it. He was sad for me. I think it kinda opened his eyes that golly, this guy was just like me and this can happen, and it can end so quickly. I had trouble kinda talking to Cooper about it. So, I kinda wrote him a letter. What it said was that even though he can no longer play football, that he would live his dream of playing football through me. Going forward he was gonna play football for me. I've always remembered that. My brother is playing through me. [John] Peyton wore Cooper's number. And he honored his brother by becoming the best high school quarterback in the country. In two years, he threw for more than 5,000 yards and had 69 touchdowns. Peyton was a prodigy. It wasn't just the Manning name that you became enamored with. Here's a guy with good size, athleticism. He was just a winner. I guess at an early age, my dad always taught me if you wanna be successful in whatever you wanna do, you gotta have a great work ethic. Peyton, all the time, would refer to what his dad said, the tips he would give him, the advice he would give him. And that was because unlike some sons of famous father's who feel the pressure and it becomes daunting, that they can't deal with it, Peyton embraced it. He embraced his dad, he called his dad his hero, he wanted to be like his dad. Can't do it. I don't think I'll ever be as good as he was. In college, he was one of the greatest college quarterbacks to ever play the game, that's just kinda my opinion, but if I can be the person he is, to kinda handle everything the way he did, then I think I'll be a good person. This thing with Peyton was building up to, he was hearing from 100 schools. And he didn't know where he wanted to go. Up to that point, everybody had always been kind of a legacy guy. If you were so and so's son, and he was an All American at Alabama, he's going to Alabama. Everyone had felt that okay, Manning, Ole Miss. Any Manning's gonna come to Ole Miss. Growing up, that's the only college game I ever went to, and I loved the campus, and once I started getting recruited, I kinda said, "Well, there are some other schools "actually out there," and you visit them, and you say, "Wow, this is a pretty good place as well." [Interviewer] Are you gonna go to Ole Miss? I don't know. [Interviewer] There is a lot of pressure though, -isn't there, to go there? -There is, obviously there is, my dad went there, and a lot of other family members went there. And of course, my brother's there now. And probably this might sound, I don't know bragging or not, but probably a good portion of the state of Mississippi probably wants for me to go to Ole Miss. At that time, we were about to go on probation and everybody knew it. So, who could blame Peyton for not coming to Ole Miss? [Ryan] There was more going on to Peyton Manning's decision than people knew at the time. Had Cooper played football at Ole Miss, would his brother have followed him there? Probably would have gone to Ole Miss just to have the opportunity to play with him again, especially at my parent's alma mater. He is mature, and he's smart, and he'll decide where he wants to spend his four years. I just never felt like it was my responsibility to force my son to go to Ole Miss. He was gonna decide where he wanted to go to college with just our support. Not our influence where to go but our support. Had my dad told me to go to Ole Miss, I would have gone to Ole Miss. I'm thankful that my dad let me make my own decision. First thing, from the start, he said, "Peyton, this is your decision, "you do what you want." But he said, "The minute you tell me "and the minute you put the word out, "don't you dare look back for one second." And that's what I'm doing. And I'm going to Tennessee and as I told him last night, right now I'm just kinda seeing orange right now. The reaction of Peyton Manning going to Tennessee and Knoxville was dancing in the streets. Then in Oxford, Mississippi it was almost a funeral. It was viewed by a lot of people as treason. It was viewed by a lot of people as the Benedict Arnold of college football. They blamed Archie. "Archie, how could you not get your boy to come to school here?" There was a little backlash [laughs]. It was a little tough on me. Archie got some ugly, ugly phone calls, letters. There were some pretty nasty letters. And I think finally, he finally called one guy and said, "Listen, if you wanna meet me, we'll talk about it, but don't say anything else about my son like that." He was willing to kinda take the hits on behalf of his kid because at the end of the day, what Archie wanted was for his boy to be happy. And he made a great decision. He made a great decision. It was the right place for him. [John] Peyton planned to red shirt his freshman year. Fate intervened. In the first game that season, Tennessee's starting quarterback was injured. -[upbeat music] -[crowd cheering] [Commentator] Here comes Peyton Manning, making his entry as a quarterback for the University of Tennessee, get used to it. He looks awfully young out there to me. Archie, this is a tough situation for your son to be in. What can we expect out of him at this point? Well, he's been out there three weeks. But he's worked hard. I think he's as prepared as you can be. All of a sudden, Peyton's the guy. He had to be the guy, and he progressed as only Peyton could do, really, really fast. I never ever, doubted Peyton in any way. He was so prepared to be a quarterback. Peyton was so scared of not being prepared that he would over prepare. There was a game against Mississippi State that I remember. It was gonna be the first time that Peyton Manning would play and Mississippi saw him. And he made a pass, 40 yard across the field pass, and I'm like, "That's an NFL throw." [Commentator] Manning to the left side, -beautifully thrown ball! -[crowd cheering] We had some fabulous games. Probably the first time we beat Alabama, Peyton's sophomore year. They hadn't beaten 'em, I don't know in how many years. I knew the games that my dad had had against certain schools, and I knew what Alabama football meant. [Commentator] Alabama 33, Mississippi 32. -That's the final score. -[dramatic music] The first pass of his first game that he played at Alabama was a touchdown. [Commentator] To the 40, to the 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, five, what did he do? -Touchdown on play number one. -[crowd cheering] [Peyton] Playing in that game was fun as the games I've played in. They played Ole Miss twice, that was hard. That was a hard game. It was, it was kinda one that we saw on the schedule, and we're like, "Okay we're gonna, "we're gonna get through this one." [crowd cheering] [Commentator] Tennessee and Peyton Manning take on Ole Miss in a game the entire state of Mississippi has long awaited. There is Archie Manning, who played from '68 to '70, a legend in the state of Mississippi. There was so much intensity surrounding that match up, I knew the family was struggling. Peyton played not good, but great. [crowd cheering] [Commentator] Under pressure, throws inside, touchdown. So, a triumphant first match against his dad's old school. Peyton Manning leads Tennessee. Archie did not wanna be seen at the game. That was his kid's moment, not his. At Tennessee, Archie Manning did not wanna be one these parents where the cameras panned over to him and showed him at the game. So, there were times when he would sit in the stands, trying to have a disguise on. He'd have a hat pulled way down, or he would try to dress in a way that you couldn't find him or recognize him. His goal was to have the focus on his son playing ball, and not on him. He was never interfering in any way. The fact is I'd have to kinda pull things out of him occasionally. What do you think, and what are you seeing at practice? I invited Archie, "Hey, sit in." Here's a guy, pro football player, it's gonna be great. And I'm putting in our system and I'm going through formations and numbering system. Coach Cutcliffe wanted my dad to sit in on the offensive meeting. 30 minutes into the time, I look over, my dad's asleep. Archie is out on the couch, dead asleep. [Peyton] It was in his kinda way saying, "Hey, y'all coach him on the Xs and Os, I'm Peyton's dad." He was gonna be a parent first, and then kind of an ex football player after that. [dramatic music] [John] At Tennessee, Peyton established a Manning legacy all his own. In four seasons, he had an SEC record, 11,102 passing yards, more than double his dad at Ole Miss. He threw for 89 touchdowns and had 28 school records. Peyton also had what Archie never did, -[dramatic music] -a father there to see it all. He came to all our games, I think that was important to him. I knew my dad was coming to my game. Maybe something to do that I felt like I lost my dad at a young age but it just, we were just parents. He was an amazing parent as a sports parent. He always took it away from football and to being the person you need to be in this situation. [John] Peyton graduated in just three years. Yet he returned for his senior season in 1997. He led his team to a 11 and one regular season record, including an SEC Championship. Peyton Manning was considered a near lock to win the Heisman trophy. People have been talking about him winning this Heisman for months. How do you feel as a parent? I think he's kinda tired of it. He's ready for it to happen one way or the other. We're gonna be proud of him one way or the other. -[paper ratting] -And the winner, from Michigan, Charles Woodson. [crowd cheering] I watched Archie and Olivia handle that with such grace. Not upset about Peyton, celebrating somebody else's good fortune. How great a lesson. [John] Peyton's college career was over. A prolific era in the pros would follow. Archie had one more son to carry on the family name in college. And this son would pen his own chapter, where the Book of Manning was first written. [Archie] None of us had any clue what Eli's dreams were 'cause he didn't say a whole lot, he didn't express 'em. But I guess he kinda liked what he saw of Cooper and Peyton's program. When I had my opportunity, I said, "Hey, you know I wanna be great. I want an opportunity to win a State Championship." [John] Like his brothers before him, Eli Manning carried on his family football tradition and wore number 18. And like Peyton, he was heavily recruited. But there was no controversy in Eli's college decision. [Eli] I've made my decision early and I decided to go to Ole Miss. My dad was obviously a great player, I guess around 30 years ago and... [audience laughing] A lot of people think I had a lot of pressure going there. But I really don't feel it. Yeah, I don't know if my dad would have been invited back to the state of Mississippi if I had gone somewhere else. [laughs] A lot of people feel like it got me off the hook. Got people not mad at me anymore. And then a little bit, it scared me a little bit, because Peyton had had a really good run at Tennessee. I'm afraid Ole Miss people are gonna say, "Okay, that's what Eli's gonna do for Ole Miss." I think it was a little tough for me. I never kinda wanted to admit it, but trying to follow really more in Peyton's footsteps, and he'd just left college, a first pick in the NFL draft, can I play at that level? [John] Peyton's offensive coordinator at Tennessee, David Cutcliffe, was Eli's head coach at Ole Miss. For the youngest Manning, the family name felt more like a burden than a benefit. During his freshman year, Eli was arrested for public intoxication. He called me to tell me about it. And so, I feel like I handled it good, I didn't holler and scream. He was remorseful, he was sorry. He didn't use good judgment. And Eli had to make a decision. I talked with him in a manner that I don't want an answer right now. But what are you really wanting out of this? You wanna be South Eastern Conference, you want to be All American? I can't figure out your goals. Do you wanna be the best player that's ever played in the history of this school? And he comes back to me and he says, "I wanna be the best that's ever played here." And it was kinda during that moment that I said, "Hey, I gotta get serious about this." It's hard to say that something like that is good for someone or is, they say best thing that ever happened to him, but sometimes you gotta mess up a little bit to wake up. [John] A new page was turned. Rather than run from his family legacy, Eli embraced it. Reading some of the clippings of when my dad was in college and how they loved him and praised him. From that day forward, football was my priority. I red shirted my first year. The next year as a red shirt freshman. I played in a few games early on. Didn't really do much and the Music City Bowl, we were getting beat pretty good. -[dramatic music] -They put me in in the fourth quarter, went right down the field. [Commentator] At Ole Miss, he doesn't have to be another Peyton, he can be the first Eli Manning. -[crowd cheering] -Make his own mark in college football. Wide open in the end zone, touchdown, Armstrong. They scored 22 unanswered points and he just lit it up. It was like he was playing a video game. [crowd cheering] [Commentator] Manning, touchdown! Looking for some of that Manning magic. Touchdown, what a call. And they get the two point. And I'm like, "Wow, "we almost came back and won that football game. "This guy is incredible." If we could have played another quarter, we might have won the game because he was hot. That was the game where we all said, "Hey, these next three years are gonna be special." [John] He was no longer Archie's son or Peyton's brother. He was simply Eli Manning. At Ole Miss, he broke 47 school records, more than half of which belonged to his dad. Eli threw for over 10,000 yards and engineered comeback wins over SEC rivals Alabama, LSU and Auburn. As a senior, he led the Rebels to their first 10 win season in 32 years and a January berth in the Cotton Bowl. [upbeat music] [Commentator] The Ole Miss Rebels have not been to the Cotton Bowl since 1962, and a big reason they're here this season, Eli Manning. And when they got to the Cotton Bowl, -it was kind of the arrival. -[crowd cheering] We're back on New Year's Day again. We're back playing one of the great classic games. We're playing against a great classic team. This feels like it did with Archie Manning. -[dramatic music] -[upbeat music] And it was the day that everyone had kinda built toward. They thought it might come with Cooper. They thought it might come with Peyton. But in the end, it was Eli that got Ole Miss back to where his father had had 'em decades earlier. [John] The Rebels fell behind 14 to seven. -Eli brought them back. -[dramatic music] He converted twice on third and long as Ole Miss scored 24 unanswered points. It was the first January win for Ole Miss since the Sugar Bowl in 1970 with Archie Manning. No offense to Archie at all but Eli Manning, in my opinion is the best football player that's ever played at University of Mississippi. [Commentator] 31, 28 Ole Miss a winner, and Eli Manning's final collegiate game. Nothing else mattered at that moment. Peyton not going there, Cooper's injury, it brought it all to a culmination. It entrenched the Manning legacy. [crowd cheering] [John] Archie Manning Mississippi legend, his boys, SEC and NFL icons. Life has been good. But not easy. One constant has remained in the Manning narrative. A son longing for his father, who became a father, forever there for his sons. Realizing what my dad experienced in he had committed suicide, I think that certainly had an impact on how my dad raised us. I've never regretted spending time with my family and spending time with my children. And we've really been blessed there. He's one of the most tender hearted people I know. Couldn't ask for a better father to my children. I feel real lucky to have my dad. I think my dad loved all of us so much. A lot of good memories. I think my dad was very, very loving. Big on getting a hug every morning, every night. Just the relationship that you my dad had with all three boys that I wanna have that with my daughter. I guess one of the neater things is not only my dad, he's really been my best friend. My dad, one time, he was taking me to college. And he was driving me over to Oxford, my first day of football practice. And I asked him, "What do you think I'll study?" He said, "You find something you think you'll be good at." He said, "I just want you to be a good guy." That was I wanted to be with my children. I hope they think I'm a good guy. [upbeat music] Now we got wonderful grandchildren. That's underrated, that's better than they tell you it is. Everybody agree, let's see who everybody's favorite college team is. Who we pulling for in college? Ole Miss. Ole Miss. -LSU. -No, you don't, you're messing with me there. But I wanna go to Vanderbilt. He's an Ole Miss guy, right? How many years did you play for Saints? For the who, Saints? I was in my 12th year with the Saints when I got traded. -Where? -And I played a couple, -I went to Houston. -Oilers. And then the Vikings. I'm bad luck at Giants games. You're bad luck, so Eli won't let you come anymore. I've been to about five and we've lost every time. So, you don't get to go anymore. I'm good luck at Giants games. -You're good luck. -By myself. You're good luck. I'm good luck at Saints games. Good luck at Saints games, okay. Yeah, you are. [Archie] We all need luck. ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh, oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ [film reel rattling]
