Hey, old man! You feeling mighty cheerful this morning, huh? Yes, honey, everything is looking good. Bertha's bound to win. I can feel it in my bones. That was adequate. Adequate? What are you talking about? It was damn good and you know it. That was adequate and you know it. What do you say, Steer? Steer says, Moo, did a good job. Adequate, huh? Adequate. Rack, you wouldn't dare. Come here, IittIe girIy. Come here. Come here. No, Rack! No! No! Stop it! Stop, can you, John. I may be a lot of things to a lot of people. But I'm not my brother. Doctor Hansen, you have an emergency phone call... from Walter Colby. Rack... John isn't around anymore. Maybe it's time to get used to it. Give him a good rub down. Wal. Hello, Doc. The server said you called. Yeah, I thought maybe be best I come out here. Remember that calf I've been spouting off about? She's real sick. I'm sorry to hear that. But you've got sick calves before. Nothing like this. Looks like she's walked into a hornets' nest. Never seen nothing like it. What do you think, Doc? I've a lot of money invested in that calf. I've entered it in the County Fair. She's a cinch to win. It ain't the black leg, is it? I'll let you know in a few hours. Mildred... give me the lab in Flagstaff. Tell them I'm on my way. Thank you. The calf‘s dead, Wal. Ain't that a crock. Two years of breeding shot to hell. I did what I could. She was too far gone. There's just so much I can do. You got the bull, you can do her again. Was it the black leg? I'm not sure. I don't think so. I'm going to take the blood samples to Flagstaff. Why don't you check your stock? When I get back, maybe I'll have some answers for you. You ain't going to quarantine me, are you? I hope not. What are you looking at? Outside. It's going to be alright, honey. Rack don't want to quarantine you. Damn it. It ain't fair. A thousand bucks of prize money shot to hell. Man been busting his butt, the way I've been doing it. I'll tell you what it is, woman. I'll tell you what it is. You think I don't know? Yep. I'd say this tyre is definitely flat, alright. The way I see it, you're going to need yourself a new tyre. I'll tell you what I can do... I can let you have a recap for 22 dollars, mounted. I've got five dollars. All I've got. It ain't worth no more. Hey, old Clyde. I can't sell you no damn tyre... for five dollars. 18 dollars and that's the best I can do, Clyde. Hold up! Hold it! Gosh darnit! Maybe I've got an old tyre out in the shed you can use... until you get yourself something better. I know, you've got five dollars that's all you've got. Just pull it out of the way, and I'll see what I can do. Baron can really fly that machine, can't he? Listen, can I help you with something? No, you carry on with that. I'm fine. I appreciate that. Sell another tyre. This is your Uncle Bill, on radio KLBJ... from beautiful downtown Prescott. We 're bringing you you're very morning country music show. Damn spider. Having himself a field day in here. That one... Shit. I ought to be getting ten dollars for a tyre like that. Damn old fool. God almighty! Oh, God. Take that, you ugly shit. Would you fill it up, please? When you check under the hood don't get any grease on the paint. Oh, no ma'am. I wouldn't want to do that. Oh, I bet this car goes real fast, huh? A-ha. Is there a nice quiet hotel in town? Yes, ma'am. You just go down the road a couple of miles... and you'll see a sign saying, Washburn's Lodge. Emma will fix you up. Thank you. Where's your Iadies' room? You go round the building, turn left at the end... and it's on your left hand side. It's out of order. You'll have to use the men's room. I can show you the way, stand guard for you. No, thank you. I'll manage just fine. Doc, I understand Colby is having a few problems out there. Nothing serious. The owner of this car wants it filled up. And don't get no grease on the paint. Where's she at? She's in the men's room. The men's room, huh? Hey, wait a minute. What the hell is she doing in there? Why don't you ask her? Looking for someone? Oh, yes. I was told in town that I could rent a cabin here. That's right. The name's Emma Washburn. Pardon my manners. That's alright. I'm Diane Ashley. Is that right? Rooms are nine bucks a night and the cabins, eleven. Prices are going up soon. 0h, why is that? The County Fair. Of course. We're not trying to gyp you. But Camp Verde is so far off the beaten path... we've got to make a buck anyway we can. Now, meals are served at designated hours... no later, no sooner. Yes, ma'am. But the bar is open until midnight. I think I'd like... I think I'd like the cabin. You got it. Fred, can you clean up over there? I'll give the lady a hand. Would you know where can I find Dr Robert Hansen? Rack? It's ten minutes south of here. Are you a friend of Rack's? No. Well, if you ain't, you soon will be. Here we are. It's ain't exactly home but it'll do for a couple of days. Alright. Walter, will you settle down? I called the university 3 times. They're sending someone to examine the carcass. They didn't say why. Damn it. Nobody's mentioned quarantine except you. I'll get back to you. We'll have to shut down Colby. He'll be mad as hell. Here. Looks like the Mayor's car. Could be nothing but trouble. Rack... What's this about you planning to quarantine the Colby place? With the County Fair only three weeks away, this is serious. You know in a small town like this word gets around very fast. I don't have to tell you how the people are. They get upset at anything. There's a lot of money at stake here. Sounds like you need a beer. -Hi, Gene. -Hi. Here's what I've got in mind. If you find any problems at the Colby place... keep it to yourself. You've got to have a low profile. Friend of yours? No. Good afternoon. I'm Diane Ashley. I was told I could find a Dr Hansen here. Afternoon. I'm Gene Smith. This is Mayor Connors. A pleasure. As for the doctor, he's standing right over there. Thank you very much. Excuse me. Hello. You? Who? Me? I'm from the department of entomology at Arizona State University in Tempe. Well, have a seat. Want a beer? No, thank you. You submitted some blood samples; a urine test and a smear. That's right. I suggest you look these over. You've a very serious problem. Why don't you tell me how serious a problem? Does that mean we'll have a quarantine? No, at least not from our preliminary findings. That's great. Best news I've heard all day. Excuse me, I have to get back to town. I've got County Fair business to take care of. Goodbye. -Bye, Rack. Bye, Gene. -Bye. Pardon me for intruding, ma'am, but... what exactly did that calf die of? Venom. A massive dose of venom. Red corpuscles were almost non-existent. Venom? Are you telling me that calf was brought down by a snake bite? No, I'm telling you it was brought down by spider venom. You're serious. You want me to believe a 200 pound calf was killed by a spider? Frankly, Dr Hansen, I don't care what you believe... however I'd like to count on your full co-operation. I'd like to examine the carcass and visit the ranch as soon as possible. The carcass is in the freezer. And we'll visit the Colby ranch in the morning. That'll be fine. By the way I'm staying at... You know where I'm staying, you directed me there. Would you like to have dinner? I probably will. I'll see you in the morning. Slick as an knat's ass, isn't she? How did you make out in town today? Did you meet Rack? Yes, and I met the Mayor and the sheriff. They both seem like very nice men. As for the Mayor, yeah. But that Gene Smith... He and I used to be well, pretty close. And now? Now? We're different kind of friends. A long time ago, that Gene Smith... used to be one hell of a man with the ladies. But now all he needs at night is a case of beer. I guess I wore him out. It's sad though when... a man's main interest moves up to his stomach. You didn't meet yet. Diane Ashley... this is Vern and Betty Johnson. Theyjust drove up in that fancy motor home outside. All the way from Nebraska, for the County Fair. We're from Colorado. Nice to meet you, Miss Ashley. Hi. Colorado, Nebraska. If it ain't Arizona, it's all the same. You saw my motor home out there? Forty thousand dollars worth. I understand you're a scientist. You and Vern have a lot in common. Oh, really? That's how I make my money. Kind of scientific, through chemicals. You're a chemist? No, you don't understand. He invented a new chemical toilet. The kind they use at construction sites. Sold the business though. Sold out to my partner. I just couldn't take the pressure any more. Say... Can I buy you a drink? A pretty girl like you shouldn't be drinking alone. No, thank you. Mr and Mrs Johnson. Good night. Chemical toilets. Well, hello there. My goodness, what are you doing here? You're supposed to live in the ground, not in houses. You're pretty though. Come on, I'll take you outside. There we go. Go on now. Go burrow yourself a home some place. Off you go. Go on. Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Still no sign of old Jake, huh? Fool dog. I always said he was too stupid to find his way home. Hey, here comes company. Hey, Wal. Heard anything? This is Miss Ashley... from the venomous animal section at Tempe. I'm sorry to hear about your calf. From what I could tell he was a fine-looking animal. Colby! Colby! Colby! Old Jake is dead! What are you talking about? Out behind the barn. It would appear this one died the same way the calf did. I guess the next step is to destroy my stock. You might as well put a gun to my head while you're at it. Now, Mr Colby... your stock is not dying from any plague or bacterial infection. Both animals died from massive injections of spider venom. There you go again. There's no way a spider can kill a dog, or even a cat. Maybe one can't, what about a few hundred? That explains the spider hill. Spider hill? The damnedest thing I ever saw. This morning when I was hunting for the dog, I watched it for an hour. Hundreds of them. Let's take a look. I'm seeing this, but I don't believe it. I've never seen anything like this before. How about you, Hansen? Beats the hell out of me, Ashley. It sure gives you the creeps. How many do you figure are in here? The size of this hill, there could be thousands, I guess. You want to know how many are in this hill? I'll show you how many are in this damn hill. Take it easy. You'll get your chance. Mrs Colby, could you get me an empty can with a lid? I don't think DDT is going to kill them. No. Most spiders, especially the big ones, become immune to it. Can you get him to leave it alone until I do more checking? I think so. For a while, but not long. Almost everything he's got is tied up in that livestock. This is amazing. This guy here is 600 miles from where he should be. Here you go. Thank you. I hope they don't get into the house. They give me the willies. I'd like to examine the area where the first animal died. Okay, this way, ma'am. Wal, could you drive Miss Ashley, Ms Ashley... over to Emma's? I'm a half an hour late from seeing my girl. Now, I know you're going to have dinner tonight... why don't we do it together? It seems we both have very busy schedules. Uncle Rack, uncle Rack! Hi, honey. How are you? I'm great. But my cat ran away. Your cat ran away? Don't worry about him, he's a tom cat. He likes to prowl around. Not unlike some other people I know. Who's that lady? Are we still going on the ride tomorrow? We sure are. You think I'd miss a chance to be with the prettiest girl in Arizona? Not on a bet. You want to hear my Uncle Remus record? I sure do. You go set it up and I'll be with you in a second. I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what you mean. Rack, you're a funny man. You're not with your brother's wife, but take care of her like you were. It's like buying a cow and giving the milk away. If you don't quit pestering me... one of these mornings I'll show up... and start milking that cow. Well, make sure your hands are warm. You have a convenient way of showing up, don't you? Yeah, I'm kind of handy that way. What? No girlfriend? What's the phrase they use out here in the wide open spaces? "A little wham, bam, thank you ma'am?" She was into Uncle Remus, I wasn't. Pardon me? You're kind of pretty for a girl. Well, thank you Dr Hansen. Where are you going? Oh, dinner. I don't mind if! do. What are you doing? Dr Hansen, will you please put me down? Alright. Wait a minute. Nobody drives my car. Excuse me, but you don't seem to understand. Buckle-up, honey. Would you like some drinks? What would you like? Anything you order is just fine with me, honey pie. Two beers. Would a glass offend you? Or shall we drink from the can? How did it go at Colby's? I'm still sceptical about your spider theory. Would you be less so if a man told you? You're the only one who's uptight about you being a woman. I called Tempe today. I checked you out. They say in your field there's none better. What is this, cowboy psychology? Here we go. Thank you. To women's lib. To Gary Cooper. By the way, how did you ever get a name like Rack? Oh, I had a kid brother two years younger than me. A real pool-playing son of a bitch. He never liked to work, and I did. I used to kid him about it and say... "You're not going to have enough money to spend on girls." Every Friday night, he'd get me into a game of pool... and beat me for everything I'd earned that week. And he'd laugh and laugh, and he'd say, "Rack 'em." And the name kind of stuck and he started calling me Rack. Does he live around here? No. He got killed in 'Nam. Second day he was there. That girl I told you I had to go see it's his little daughter. I kind of look after her and her mother. I see. You know, those reports of yours... both those animals dying of spider venom. Why would spiders... suddenly turn aggressive towards livestock? I mean, venomous spiders are Ioners, they're cannibals. If they don't any food, they'll kill and eat each other. Food? You want to order? No, not right now. Food could be the principle reason for the attacks on the cattle. I mean that through the excessive use of insecticides like DDT... we're inadvertently killing off the spiders' natural source of food. So, in order to survive, spiders... as well as other insects, are having to readjust their eating habits... and becoming more aggressive. How do we get rid of them? It's the most incredible thing I've ever seen. This is a scientific phenomenon. What do you mean? As you know, all species of mygalomorphs are cannibalistic. If you put them together they kill each other. They don't colonise like ants or bees. Yet look at this picture, and this picture here. These tarantulas are not fighting. Maybe they found love. Very funny. On a hunch this morning I called the local paper. For ads on missing pets. In the last three months there has been over 30 ads... for missing animals, anything... from cats to goats. First thing in the morning... we send this off to my lab for analysis. How about the spider hill? That was the only one out there, maybe we should just burn it. Yeah, let's just burn it, baby. Where are you going, you little mother? Maybe we should burn it tonight before they do any more damage. Yep. I'll get myjacket. Wal... I'm gonna burn that hill, like it or not. We're here for the same reason. Let's burn her down. What's wrong? Nothing. Only I've never heard it so quiet. Oh, yes. Sometimes it gets so quiet out here, you can hear a pin drop. Oh, no. He's dying... and there's nothing I can do. Seven years I've saved for that bull. Are you alright? Yes, I'll be alright. Let's just burn down that damn spider hill. Birch, if I was you... I'd get him into town and have a doctor look at his arm. Maybe you should both stay in town until we know what's happening here. Are you crazy, lady? This is our home. And no damn spiders are going to run us out. That bull is going to break him for sure. I'm getting scared. If those spiders will go after a bull... what's to stop them from turning on us next? Burn, you sons of bitches! Burn in hell! Burn! Good riddance, you bastards! You'll never kill any of my stock again. Hi, Terry. Hi. Hi, Linda. Hi, I'm Linda Hansen. Are you Rack's new girl? My, aren't you the expert! No, I'm Diane Ashley. How do you do? Hello, I'm Terry Hansen. It's good to know you. Come on out back there and I'll show you my swing. Will you be here long? It's hard to tell. I could be here a while though. Ifeel like I'm playing hooky it's so beautiful out here. What if the reports come back early and I have to go back? Plus I don't want to intrude. Don't be silly. Every Wednesday I take Linda out for a ride... while Terry helps out in the general store. Sure, welcome aboard. I'll get the food. Terry... is it alright? It's great. Super. Don't you want me to drive you into Cottonwood, honey? I'll be okay, Birch. I just need a little time to think. You're one hell of a woman. You get yourself back home. I'm going to be just fine. Stay away from that field today, okay? Okay. Uncle Rack, I want to see what there is to eat. We've got all kind of good things. Sure, honey. You take this blanket. You spread it on that flat lot over there. Can you do that? Of course. I know how. Come here, I want to show you something. It's so beautiful here. So peaceful. There's Colby's truck. Great thing about this part of the country... everybody knows everybody. No! Isn't this pretty, Serena? No, I don't like it. I like blue ones. Now you behave yourself, or I'm going to give you a spanking. I could do with a beer right now. I'm just too comfortable to get up and get it. Well, don't move. Okay. Thank you. Anything else? No, I'm fine for the moment. Alright. Where's my apple? You like been taken care of, don't you? Anybody taking care of you? Not at the moment. I told you no. Mama said you can't leave... or else the bad wolf is going to eat you up. Linda, come on, we better get moving. Okay. I'm coming. -What happened? -It doesn't look good, Gene. Mr Benson there, was driving behind him when it happened. Suddenly, he started driving erratic. Next thing, he was over the cliff. We're ready to bring him up now. -Hold it. Let me take a look first. -Go ahead. Have you got a problem? Truck went off the road. I have to get down there without breaking my neck. I can give you a hand. Sit in the truck a while. Sure. Damn. That looks like Colby's truck. It is Colby. Ijust saw him. Hold on, I'll be right there. Hi, Gene. What brings you out here? I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you, Birch. You're going to quarantine us? It'll kill Colby if you do that. You can't do that to us. This ranch is all we've got. Rack. Hello, Rack. I've been trying like a hoot to locate Miss Ashley. I don't suppose you've seen her? Yes, Mildred. She is. Hold on. Yes? Yes, this is Diane Ashley. You're sure? Well, who ran the tests? Okay, I'll keep you advised. Certainly. Good bye. The venom we sent to the lab is five times more toxic than normal. Rack. Yes, Gene. Where? We'll be right out. It was the sheriff. He's over at Colby's. He's found another 20 or 30 hills just like the one we burned. -What do you think? -Well, there's only one thing to do. Let's just spray the whole damn area. Gene, you get a hold of Baron... tell him to get out in the morning. No, you can't do that. I'm sorry, but you don't seem to understand. You see... pesticides make it worse and you'll be getting into a heap of trouble. Listen, honey. You don't understand. The County Fair is in two weeks... and I don't want a bunch of spiders roaming all over. It's notjust a bunch of spiders... it's a migration caused by some kind of imbalance. Because a lot of ignorant people like you... have killed off their food with your stupid DDT. Now, I'll tell you something else, sir. It's not just a few spiders, but millions... and your town is right in their path. Alright, honey. If spraying won't kill them, what will? Natural predators like birds, rats... Rats! I want you to get the strongest pesticide available. I want to spray everything in sight, the spider hills, the fields... everything, do you understand? You can't use Parathion without permission from the State. Listen, Gene, poppycock. It's a crazy idea. The stuff is lethal, you could endanger the whole town... Listen, Rack. Will you let me handle this? Can you get some volunteers in and help move people into town? Yeah, I suppose so. Are you willing to take responsibility for this action? The Sheriff is in charge here and I'll do everything I can to help him. Come on, let's go. Itell you, by the time I get through... there won't be a spider left around here. Stay well clear of town. Parathion is deadly. Yeah, I know. See you later. Okay, Rack. He knows better than to fly over town. That's poison he's carrying. Get some help! Quick, quick! Call the fire department, now! Rack, the gas tank could blow, get out of there! Oh, God. Everybody outside. Quick. Somebody quick, get some water. Somebody call the fire department. It's no use. It's no use, he's dead. It's all over. Yes, that will help but, sir, I need to know exactly when. Good. Thank you. I've called everyone I can. They'll send an investigative team in couple of days. What the hell do we do now? How many spiders are out there? I wish I knew. There are many theories on man's fate if insects were to turn on him. All I can tell you is that in none do we come out on top. Thanks a lot. I was really worried about that. Baron's spray didn't even touch those spider hills. I think someone should take a run out to Colby's place. -Jake, get Birch Colby on the phone. -Sure. Mildred, could you get Birch Colby please? There's no answer out there, Gene. I better take a run out there. Gene, I think I better go get Terry and Linda and bring them into town. Linda, honey! Time to come in and eat! I'm not hungry. It's time to come in anyway. Come on. Linda! Linda, I said no more stalling. It's time to come in and eat. Oh, my God! Linda! My baby, my baby! Linda! Oh, god! Oh, god! Oh, no! Oh, my baby.! Oh, no Linda! Oh, my baby. Run. Run to the house as fast as you can. Don't stop. Run, Linda. Run. Stay there. Get her in the truck, quick. Oh, god. Rack. Get in, get in. Terry... She's dead. Goddamn. If I'd been ten minutes earlier. Five minutes. They were biting her after she was dead. Hey... Hey... Damn. How's Linda? She's not very well. I think she's in shock. Did you reach anybody? No. The phone is graveyard dead. What the hell is going on here? You're giving me the jitters. Emma... how many people do you have in this place? Just the Johnsons, Diane, here, myself, old Fred out back. I want you to do something, without asking any questions. Go and bring Fred here. Then lock up. I'll get the Johnsons. What the hell do you mean lock up? I'm not moving an inch until you tell me what's going on. Starting with, where's Terry? Terry is dead. We don't have a lot of time to explain. But the spiders in this area, so far only the tarantulas... have organised themselves into an aggressive army. They've already killed off Colby and Linda's mother. God only knows how many others. Rack's right. We should get out of here as quickly as possible. Is that what happened to the Baron? Could be. You better get out of here. Emma, do you have any fire extinguishers here? Yeah, I think there's a couple in the kitchen. Good, go get Fred and have him bring them here. -I've never seen anything like it. -They came out of nowhere, out front. I turned around and there they were, in groups, watching me. It gave me the creeps. What are they doing there? They're only spiders. They can't hurt us, can they? I want to get out of here. I don't like this place. Honey, don't worry. It's probably a tradition. Like migrating birds, returning home. How does it feel to be under a microscope? Not funny. It's not meant to be. Get in the lodge and keep the Johnsons in there. What is it? What the hell is wrong? Get in the lodge. I can't move. I can't move. Get in the lodge. You should've seen Birch Colby. I've never seen anything like it. She was wrapped up in a cocoon, like a package. Same thing happened to old Fred. The whole country is swarming with those damn things. I'll call the State, and get some help. If you can get through. Fred... Colby. What are these cocoons? That's how they store food. Come on, Mildred. Come on. I demand to know what's going on. We'll let you know when we have a clue. Why don't you sit down? Okay? I don't blame him. I'd like to know what the hell is going on too. Have you been into town? I'm going in now. I'm trying to call. I can't get hold of my deputy. Hey, big ugly... you take care of yourself now, you hear? Yeah. I'd better get going. Rack... Keep an eye on Emma, okay? We'll load up that house on wheels and be on your tail. Chemical fire extinguishers kill them, so round up plenty. You got it. Somebody, quick! Rack. Emma, get me a hammer, nails, anything. Oh, God! Lumber, anything. IfI can seal the cracks, they can't get through. It's in the cellar. I'll get it. Vern, forget it. We're getting out of here. Come on. Jump to me. Jump, jump! Attagirl! Come on. We're getting out of here. There's thousands of them. We'll never make it. What? Of course we will. It's alright. I'm telling you, I don't think we should chance it. The fire extinguisher! It's okay. Over there. They're coming down the fireplace! Vernon... Get some kerosene, anything. Get some wood. Chairs, tables. Help! I'll get some more stuff to burn. Why is it so hot in here? The air conditioning is on. Emma, turn the air conditioning up. It is up. Betty, give me a hand up. Steady that chair. Get them off me! Get them off me! Get them off me! Get them off me! Too big, give me that one. Hammer and nails. Vernon, take me away from this place. They're awful and I hate them. Watch it. Hold on, hold on. Oh, shit. What time is it? Nearly 11 o'clock. Why haven't we heard from the Sheriff? I mean, he must know we're trapped in here. He might have gone to Cottonwood. Or even Flagstaff to get some help, especially if this thing is local. Yeah. Patience, honey. You got to have a little patience. I've spent a lot of years waiting for that man. The phone is still dead. Hey, come on you two. Come here. Why don't you both get some rest and I'll check things out. Best idea I've heard yet. Come on, honey. What was that? Sounds like it came from one of the bedrooms. Oh, my god. Vern, do we have any more lumber? Yes, but I don't know how much. Go get it. Get me hammer and nails, Diane. Hell, use the furniture. This will do. Emma, where's the fuse box? In the basement, under the window. Get everyone into the kitchen. Diane, you get Linda. It's just me, little one. Here we go. Come on. I'll get the flashlight in the toolbox. No, I'll get it. You go into the kitchen with everyone else. Get off! Help, help. My God. Emma get some ammonia to neutralise the venom. God. What a mess. What an awful night. What time is it? 6 o'clock. 6 o'clock? It's coffee time, to hell with everything else. Vern got all the windows boarded up in the main room. I'm going to go check on Linda. How are you doing, Rack? Ah, terrific. When a woman gets to be my age, she needs a good night sleep. Gene couldn't stand the sight of me in the morning, did you know that? He used to say to me... "Emma, for Christ's sake, go get some coffee inside of you... before I take a look at you." We can't be sure. Yes, we can, Rack. We'd have heard from him by now. Coffee is going to be ready in a minute. Oh, this damn thing. Nothing, huh? Trying to get the 6 o'clock news. We should be on the wire services. Keep trying. I'm going to take a look outside it's daylight. Rack... even for a split second you could let hundreds in. I'll be careful. Rack. Why don't try one of the windows? If they'd broken the glass we'd have heard. Alright. If it makes you feel any easier. Hello, precious. Good morning, you happy folks out there in the land of paradise. This is a glorious morning. The sun is shinning, and there 's no clouds. The temperature in your favourite station is 61 degrees... and it's warming up real good during the day. I hope you're going to stay tuned for some good old country music... with your friendly host here, Uncle Bill. Who the hell cares about Uncle Bill? What about us? We 've got a pile of albums, must be a mile high. And all your real favourites. Nothing like country music to wake us up on a ﬁne, bright morning. Local news will follow, but right now let's get into a song... with Dorsey Burnett and his country kickers... with a salute to peaceful Verde Valley, a great place to live in. Jesus Christ. Dear God. Sweet Jesus.
