Wait! Dad, where is the temple? Over there. Are we gonna make it? - No. - Oh, damn... If anyone makes it up there, they'll be reborn as angels in heaven. And will be 100 times more beautiful. -Really? -Really. Keep chanting then. Wait! Who is this broken-faced woman? Never seen her before. Hope she's not one of the Holy Father's wives. She's mine. Oh, Mother! Mother, hello. Your dance is so elegant. Is it? Follow my lead. Continue chanting, Dad. Wait up! -What? Are we gonna finish the ceremony? -Mother is right. You guys are always late. What are you wearing? So matching with the ceremony theme! Bucktooth. Don't mock her. You are no different. Look like a horse eating a watermelon. And having the whole thing. You can continue, Dad. - Can I now? - Yes, you can. Such a great voice. Stop! Here is the way up the mountain! "Only two more kilometers." Are you up for this? Yes... Well, then... Let's go! Okay, stay strong! I can't. Get up! Don't let me fall! If my feet touch the ground, I can't be ordained. What's up, buddy? Call me Holy Father. I forgot. Eaten yet? - No, it's too late now. - Oh, yeah? Mother will say goodbye to you now. And I, your lover, will leave too. Oh, I mean wife. Don't rush him, child, he is in a monastery now. How about Dad? Oh, he's been passed out since the foot hill. I'll come to visit again. Please take care of my dad. Yes. It's all done, everyone should leave. Then I'll say goodbye. Be well. Please leave soon. If the new monk and his followers would follow me to the hall, I'll find you a place. Yes. Come, follow me. You will stay here with your followers tonight. All right. Relax now and get some rest. Yes, Father. Why don't you go get the bedding? Yes, Holy Father. It's breezy up here. Nice and cool. -I better get going. -Okay. I'm taking this one. - Wait, Father. - Huh? Who is sleeping over there? The undertaker. He just died three days ago. Why are you so frightened? It's just a three-day-old dead body. Why don't you give him a funeral? How could I? There was only me in this temple. Then who prepared the body? -Me. -Who chanted the first night? -Me. -Second night? -Me. -And last night? That's right, it was me. Why don't you put him in the coffin? Oh, Holy Father, this temple is on a mountain top. Where am I going to find a coffin? Holy Father! Don't be frightened. The body's tendons have shrunk. It's natural. How do you know? Have you been dead before? Yes, I, uh... Are you crazy? Come on, help me get him down. All of you. Uh, Father? Holy Father! It's a bit shrunk, this is natural. You earn good karma for helping the dead. -Mano. -Hmm? -Go get your good karma. -Mmm-mmm. Go. Holy Father! Holy Father! Help him down on the other end. This is all good karma, you know. He is delivering good karma. Oh, Holy Father! Saisin! Hurry up! Easy, easy. You push the legs, and you, the head. One, two, three. Don't be frightened. He has just died. The acid is still in his stomach. It's natural. Father, it's not about acid. It's just a fart from me. Farting is also natural. Very well. Get some rest then. Uh, Father. How about the body? It'll be in the hall. No, I mean, uh... What are we going to do with the body? I'll leave that up to you. - So heavy. - Holy Father. Why are you complaining? Stop being scared. There are three of us here. It's so stinky. Ghosts don't exist. Don't be scared. Holy Father. Where are you going? To keep this mortician's dead body n its place. Holy Father, I think he looks familiar. What are you talking about? Take this. Where? Can you see now? -Yes. -Holy Father! Holy Father! Holy Father, let's swap. What is it with you? -Mano. -Mmm? I'm cold. Let's swap. Ooh. What are you guys doing? Shit... Why do you follow me? Holy Father. Why did you dump me? If you stayed, I wouldn't get to sleep. - You should be mindful. - Hurry. You know, we are in the temple. Why would you be scared of ghosts? Brothers. Hmm? Brothers. Why are you standing there frightened? Follow me. Come on, hurry. What's wrong? Brothers. Come closer. Go, go. Too close, that's too close. Too close. You're with a monk, why are you scared of ghosts? Holy Father, he got us last night. Mmm. You were there too, weren't you? Scary shit. It was the first night, he had to perform well. On the following night, he'll drop. He'll drop, trust me. Don't be scared. Follow me. Brothers, please be calm. How could he do that to us? Holy Father. Please. Holy Father! Holy Father! Holy Father! Holy Father! You're a monk! Why are you scared of ghosts? I'm not scared, I'm just surprised. Hormone, why are you giving the alms so early? Not so early, it's only 5:00 a.m. Please. Let me help. Wait up. Won't you give me a blessing? Good luck then. Sadhu! Hey! It's so fulfilling to be blessed by someone I love. Please. Folks! What frightened you? Hey, Saisin, why are you holding onto me? I'm scared. Holy Father, please. Oh, Baifern. Why didn't you come to the ceremony? Yeah, Holy Father waited for you all day. I had a feeling that he didn't want to see me. -Hmm, is it true? -Is it? -You didn't? -Brothers! Let me give alms. You keep giving me food, when will the temple be rich? Next time, make it a thousand, or ten thousand in cash. I'm not talking to you. 'Cause I'm not pregnant. Huh? The rice... Holy Father, you haven't blessed me. May you live long and prosper. It's true, isn't it? Yes. There, I knew it! Ma'am. Will I have food for today? - Hey, Saisin. - What's up? Have you memorized five Buddhist precepts? Of course I have. "First, we shall not kill. But if it feels right, it's fine." Second? "We shall not steal, but if the police are chill, it's fine." And the third? "We shall not lie, but if you can hide, it's fine." And the fourth? "We shall not drink alcohol, but if we can afford all, it's fine." And the fifth? "We shall not commit adultery, but if their hubbies are busy... It's fine." -Fine, my ass! You'll end up in hell. -Leave me be. Brothers! You both should not joke around in the temple. It's not nice. -Hello. -It's me. -Light bulb. -What's up, bros? -First gear. -Give me beer. -Second gear. -Get fear. -Get a custard. -I'm a... Monk. -Table one. -Get it done. - Table two. - Got no shoes. Table eight. Customers are full, Father. - Chiang Mai. - Fun night. I meant to ask if it's far. Ah, if you finish cleaning up the hall, then go clean the temple court. Okay. Brothers, you are in the temple. -Behave. -Yes. -Where is Buddha? -In my mind. Where is Dharma? In my mind. -Where are Sung and Kung? -Sarcoid is itchy. But I'm not. I better get going. Holy Father, let me ask you this. Why do you want to be ordained up here in this temple? Jazzy! Why do you do this? I love you. You understand? Jazzy! - I do, but-- - Jazzy! Oh! Who is this woman? - Go ahead. - How could she hold your arm? There are two of them. Didn't you tell her we are together? I'll take a photo for Fadebook. -"Facebook." -I'll call it Fadebook. Are you taking a photo? Take one for me. Jazzy! Jazzy, why are you messing around with my girl? You told me you don't have a boyfriend? Who? Who is your girlfriend? -There, Hormone. -Huh? -This shorty? -Yeah. Leave me alone! I like Jazzy because he is handsome. You don't have the look. You wish you did. -You want to plus my friend? -Let's multiply them. Calm down. Don't you worry. Up you go. Jazzy, you should stay out of this. Thanks for asking. My body needs the exercise. You'll know I'm not easy. Jazzy! Jazzy, help him! Let me go! What now? Do you know that what you did is bad? I do now. What I did was the rage of a teenager. Hmm. So you became a monk to run away? It's not like that. Why do you tell me this? It's a ballad. I became a monk because I impregnated my girlfriends. You ran away from a woman. -Only because of a pregnant woman-- -Two. -You have two girlfriends? -Three. Oi. - Hey. - Hey. It's 5:00 a.m. again. Please. Holy Father, uh... I have a question for you. What is it? Well... If you weren't a monk, and we were both in love... If one day I should die, what would you do? I would become a monk. So dedicated to love. Why would you? Because I pray for that to happen. You are funny. May you live long and prosper. For love to be happy, it needs power. Just a little more, my child. Daddy! You summoned me here. - What can I do for you? - Mmm. I just want to ask you how has it been since you arrived? It's quite high up here. It's quite cold. I don't mean that. I mean, what have you learned here? Oh. I get to feed the dogs. And ring the bell in the evenings. There, I think your mind is not peaceful enough. I will send you to study in Bangkok. Bangkok! - Really, Bangkok? - Yes. What do you think? -I agree. -Hmm? How can you answer without giving it a thought? Oh, Holy Father will-- When do you want me to go? -Now. -Right now? Now. You go pack up, and travel in two days. Yes, Father. When you are in Bangkok, - you should be careful. You can't cross here. You should consider everything you do. There are a lot of people in Bangkok. You should blend in with locals. You won't be tricked or embarrassed. Yes, Holy Father. -Uh, ma'am. -Yes? Where is Victory Monument? This is Victory Monument. Uh, Father Thep said when we arrive, we have to take bus number eight. Hmm. Can you see if bus number eight has arrived? Here, 28. Holy Father, hurry. Brothers, you can't get on 28 or 38. - How about 18? - Not even 18. Father said only number eight. Don't forget, eight. - Eight? - Eight. -Eight? -Eight. -Eight? -Eight. -Eight? -Eight. Brothers, wait. It sounds weird now. Holy Father, there it is. Get on. Why such a hurry? Mano, don't push me. Mano, move away. Ouch! Give me another shot before I get off? What's with bus number eight? Swinging from left to right! Our guts flying at one point. We were close to death. Where are we? I don't know. We just got off. Hey, boy! - Holy Father! - Let's go! Holy Father! Holy Father! - Holy Father! - He runs faster than me. Holy Father! Holy Father! Stop! Holy Father! You are a monk, you're supposed to be solemn. Let us deal with this. - Hurry up. - Stop! Mano, hurry up. Catch him! Is this Yoshi, the Internet idol? Mano! Net idol! You're adorable. - Can I shake your hand? - Me, too. Brothers, where? Here. No, brother. The guy who took my bag, where is he? Where has he gone? He's gone. Why'd you stop? Why didn't you go after him? I couldn't catch up. Goodbye, Holy Father. Bye-bye. - She smiled at me. - Me too. Holy Father, that is a Net idol! Dol! Dol, dol, dol, dol! There's no way this will slip. Dol, dol, dol, dol! - There's no way this will slip! - Dol, dol, dol, dol! They'll all wake up. Dol, dol, dol, dol! Dol, dol, dol, dol! -Are you going? -There. Holy Father! There's no way this will slip! Dol, dol, dol! There's no way this will slip! Dol, dol, dol! Father Thep sent you here, right? Yes. And what's your name, Brother Jazz? It's Jazz, Father. Oh, I hear that you've come to study. -Yes. -Good. Keep studying, and you'll understand the Buddhist teachings and gain reason. We help each other here. But don't work too hard. We have the followers for that. Father, he has just arrived and must be tired. Don't let him do anything yet. Very well. This is Brother Jongruay. This is Brother TeeTee. They will be your mentors. Uh, well, then... Tom and Somboy, you go arrange the room for Brother Jazz and his followers, so Brother Jazz can relax. I remembered, Father. We took bus number eight to get here. There are many paths to this temple. -Then I should leave. -Be well. Ah, go, go, go. Holy Father, please. Greetings, Holy Father. New monk from the suburbs? Yes. In this temple, there are only city monks. Get that, y'all? Be focused. Don't be disobedient. We don't despise you. Well, some of us. This way, Holy Father. Let's go. Not you, I meant Brother Jazz. Hey, you should have told me. Your accent humiliated us. In front of the new monk... Father. So that millionaire who wants to market official Chaiyo temple amulets, -will you sign the agreement for it? -Well... Will you sign it or not? Uh... -Well, Father-- -You don't have to worry. I haven't said anything yet. The abbot is worried that they'll not do it correctly. Don't worry, Holy Father. Once Mr. Oot sells the amulets, he'll donate all the money. We can use it to support our religion. Build a beautiful temple hall. If you forbid everything, when will we have a jet? You're thinking that far ahead? Will you forbid this? Will you sign the agreement? I think you should do what you think is appropriate. Just don't ruin the temple's reputation. If that's all, we should be going. - Oh! - Father, watch out. I wasn't looking. Jazzy, I'm pregnant! Two months. Jazzy, when did you sleep with her? Uh, yeah. Jazzy! So you'll pick Baifern and LoveSick? You can't. I'm pregnant! Three months, four days, five hours, 20 minutes, 15 seconds pregnant. Yes, I can confirm. Are you all right? Should I just kill it? It has no father. -Kill it? -Yeah! Don't worry. I'm four months pregnant! Jazz! So early. Holy Father, please. Buddha is in your chest, hell is in your heart. Holy Father, Buddha is not in the chest. Heaven is. Let's pretend that I didn't say it. - It's good to dress like this in temple... - Holy Father! Not! You should dress more appropriately. If you dress like this, the monks will get-- Holy Father! Upset the whole temple. May you live long and prosper. Holy Father, please. Yeah, dress appropriately like this. Like beach balls! The lid! Sorry. Holy Father, please. You don't have to hurry. Yes, I do. How can I not? Are you sure? -Sure, Holy Father. -Sure? -I'm afraid I'll be late for breakfast. -You'll make it. I don't know what time it is. Wait, Holy Father. I think we're lost. Lost what? I told you, I've been here before. -Who are you talking to? -To you, shithead. Sorry. Forgot. I know we're friends, but you have to respect the yellow robe. - Okay, okay. - Follow me, stupid. I think you shouldn't follow me. Can you try the GPRS? Oh, we are so lost. Why are you in the mood to listen to RS records? It's called GPRS, asshole. -You are an asshole. -You are! -You are an asshole. -You are! Brothers. Can you see if I look like an asshole? Enough with this, you assholes. Turn it on, hurry up. - Start navigating. - We go here? -Straight ahead. -Okay, straight and left. At the intersection, turn left. At the intersection, turn left. Go. -And turn right. -And turn right. - Go straight. - How's it going? - Go straight. - Come on, Holy Father. It's 1:00 p.m. now. To the main road. To the main road. -Take one step back. -Take one step back. -Lift right leg. -Lift right leg. -And turn right. -And turn right. -And go straight. -And go straight. Go straight. -Go straight. -It said to go straight. -Go straight. -Don't be dumb. Go a bit left. Are you gonna walk into the post? We aren't spirits. Hurry up! -I told you to go straight. -Go straight. You dumbass. -You've reached your destination. -You are here. Goodbye. It's the same place. Oh, put your phone away. -You are stupid. -You're stupid. You are! You are! -Enough, both of you. -You are! Both of you are stupid. GPRS is bad. Give it to me. Take it to the rehabilitation center. Why? Your phone has "Edge" the whole way. Hurry up. - Go! - Hey, Holy Father. We left the temple at 5:00 a.m. Returned at 2:00 p.m. We're doomed. I missed both breakfast and lunch. Don't worry, Holy Father. You can have anything starting with "Ma." Maprao, coconut? -Yes, but not if it's the filling. -Mango? Sure, but also not the filling. So what will be filling? Ma Prao Moo Krob, stir-fry pork with basil. Ma Nha Nam Marn Hoy, stir-fry veggie with oyster sauce. It's not funny, I'm getting stressed. Ma-Nhom-Jeen-Kaeng-Keaw-Wan, noodle curry. Hmm. What's wrong, Holy Father? It's your Ma-Prao-Moo-Krob. Ma-Nha-Nam-Marn-Hoy. Ma-Nhom-Jeen-Kaeng-Keaw-Wan. Ma-Moo-Trok-Soong. Ma-Yen-Ta-Fo. He's very hungry. May you live... long... and prosper. What is it with him? He's a monk. Holy Father is receiving alms. Why did you fart? No, it was you. Yeah, I did. Again? - What? - The first one was just right. The second one, go to shit! Shit. Whatever you are giving, put it all in. My followers can't hold it anymore. Faster. May you live long and prosper. -Hmm! -That last gas bomb... - Motorbike! - Holy Father. To the temple... That, that, that temple! That temple? Which one? That one on the left. -Left at this traffic light? -Yes. There are three temples. The first one is kind of small. And there is the middle one. The last one is large. Are you going S-M-L? Well, the one with the toilet. Toilet? What are you going to do? What are monks going to do in the toilet? To take a shit, I need a toilet! -Is that okay? -Shit? -Yeah. -Why didn't you tell me? You're slow. Why didn't you just say you wanted to take a shit? Whatever temple, up to you. As you wish. -Let's go! -Wait up! Why such a hurry? -Hey! What are we going to do? -Hey! I'm so lucky, Holy Father. This is my first day. My first customer is a monk. They say it's a blessing. You sitting on my motorbike, it's like I am blessed by holy water. -I'm so happy. -How could you think this way Back then, you know... I... I never killed an ant, never slapped a mosquito. But I made a mistake. That guy was teasing my wife. So I stabbed him eight times. Who knows? He could be dead. Have you never talked to anyone? Have you been slapped by a monk? What did you just say? Uh... nothing. Are you in a hurry? You better ride it yourself. Hmm? Holy Father, I have killed a man. What should I do? Take me to take a shit. Oh! Oh, yeah, you want to take a shit! One moment! Didn't you know this a long time ago? You are very spontaneous. Coming, it's coming! Holy Father, my head. -Let me look ahead. -Brother! Holy Father, wait a second! Oh! Ah, Brother Jazz. You've come back early today. -You don't get lost anymore. -Ah. That's right. Do you smell something? Smells like a sour bamboo shoot curry. What is that? -Fermented bamboo shoot. -Mmm. There must be Cha-om in it. -Cha-om, what's that? -Acacia. Oh, city monk. Let's have breakfast. Can you smell it? Do you have a bad nose? Let's do it at the same time. One, two... It's all in my alms? So, what is it? It couldn't be fermented bamboo shoot. I think it's rotten pumpkin. I smell nothing. Holy Father! Holy Father! Holy Father, wake up. Are you all right? -I'm okay. -Okay, Holy Father. Holy Father. Holy Father! Holy Father. -Stay calm. -Help him. Holy Father! Holy Father! You didn't wait for us. Are you done taking a shit? Brother, quiet. You shit your robe? Quiet, Mano! They'll all know he shit his robe! Which one? Brothers, do you think it's beautiful up here? Very much. - You don't think it's too much? - Too much? To see a beautiful place, it's worth it. No, I mean how you dress up. It's too much. It's not. Back home, this is nothing. Bangkok people dress like this. It's in style. Style! Holy Father, whose residence is that? So many people going in and out. Please come in, hello. We are not like that. Please come in. I'm sorry, Holy Father. Master Sung and Kung don't allow temple residents. That's right. -Brothers? -Yes. Did you hear that? If they don't allow us, we should go back. -Let's go. -Where are you going? Hey! Well, I am going back to my residence. Yours is over there. I'm going to take a detour there. Please, Holy Father. Be well. - Hello, please come inside. - Hello. At night, at Holy Father Sung and Kung's residence, why are there so many people? Not only at nighttime. There are always people in there. Both day and night. You want to know why? Tomorrow, I'll take you there. You made the right decision to come to me. Your husband will come back within five to seven days. Just wait. That is some holy shit! Will you keep it together? Chin down. People are so blind. -Brother. -Brother. You can't say that. People are different. Each has individual thoughts. -Brother-- -Brother. -Listen to him. -Okay. I'm not talking. Stick out your tongue. More. More. A lot more. -And no wagging. -Okay. Has anyone used tongue on you? Yes. -Who did? -Kik. -Clearer. -Kik. Kik. -Master Kik? Oh! -Yeah. -This time is the real deal. -Holy Father. That is LoveSick. Stick your tongue out. That can't be her. LoveSick! Huh? Oh, Holy Father! Holy Father! Stop. Get out of this body. I'm not a ghost. Who is this? My ex-wife. Did you run away from your wife? I didn't run. I came here voluntarily. I'm sorry I didn't go to your ceremony. I had to come to study here. How is the baby? Huh? Whose baby? You told me that you were pregnant, didn't you? He's kicking! Now that his daddy is here, he's kicking hard. -Ma'am. -Yes? What are you doing here? I'm here for gold charming face. For who? - For you. - Hmm? Ah, no. For my friend. Her husband doesn't sleep with her much. She asked me to do this. How is the baby? He's kicking hard! I think you should go back over there before you get kicked harder. By you? No, the baby will kick you harder. Father, I think we should leave. It feels like we are talking to Iron Man. Holy Father. Holy Father! Holy Father, don't go! Holy Father! - Ma'am. - Huh? Come for tongue ritual. Yes. Let's check out the chicks next to the temple. Yoshi. Yoshi. Brothers. Good morning, Holy Father. -Where are you going? -We're going to check... Going for a walk. -Anything I can help you with? -It's okay. Oh. Do you sweep the ground here every day? Yes. The weather is nice here. Monks and novices should be all united. There are four principles. First is kindness. Kindness is love. - Loving-kindness. - Uh... -Holy Father. -Yes, Holy Father? What is love? There are many meanings in the mundane world. Love is like a fart. You can't see it, but you know it's there. -Mano. -What? Internet idol! Yoshi. She is so cute. -Hey! -Why are you pulling me? We can't let girls see us like this. Look at us. Two is compassion. To feel empathy, so people are free from suffering, ignorance, greed, anger, and infatuation. Greedy people, they kill. Brothers, sisters, they kill. Right? Record him. What? There's only 1,600. Put it away. Damn it! You thought of leaving the monkhood? I'm waiting for soldiers to come by. Why are you waiting for soldiers? So I can come with them. Suzuki Gixxer 2007, 1,000 CC. Four cylinders, Bambo pump. Titanium exhaust pipe, thunder print Pirelli tires. Price, 300,000 and up. Yamaha Filano. Automatic, 125 CC, fuel injection system. There must be six of them. Why so? -Ya-Ma-Ha, not five. -Gotcha! - Honda CBR. - This is a harvesting truck. Not a harvesting truck, it's a police bike. They use it for harvesting bribes. Holy Father, please bless us. May you live long and... prosper. Does anyone know the word krob krua in English? Holy Father Jazz. Battery. -It's "family." -Yes. Sit down. If you didn't stand up, nobody would know you're not smart. "Family" is krob krua. Do you know the abbreviation? There is an acronym for "family." It is, "Father And Mother I Love You." Children who are grateful towards parents, they are real angels. Holy Father. -Holy Father, please. -Baifern. Holy Father, please. Are you giving alms, Baifern? I'm here, right? Who is that? Who? - My cousin. - Just make it clear. Just make it clear. He is my cousin. From upcountry. So we stay together. - How could you do this? - Determined. You bring him to give the alms? - Gutsy. - Do you know what Holy Father will think? Strong. If you'd do this, why don't you just get naked and kiss him here? - Can I? - Let's get done with this! - Hello. - Don't look suspicious. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hey! Who are you? -We are friends. -We're friends. -Get out. Leave now. -Goodbye. Wait! That way. Go now. Saisin, I won't give up so easily. -I have to go inside this school! -Mmm. You should go on a diet. -Hello. -Wait. What class are you in? -I'm in Grade 12 Room 5. -Yes. You don't look familiar. You don't look familiar either. All right, get in line. - Yes! - Huh? -What's wrong? -I don't feel very well. May you live long and... prosper. Are you doing well? I am. And you? I'm fine. And... -What's your name? -No, sir. -Tono? -No, it's Nino. Holy Father! Here. Hello, Holy Father. I thought you were alone. Unbelievable. There are holy threads in the temple, and there is a big Buddha. You shouldn't be able to get in. Hey! I'm not an angel. I mean a ghost. Foul mouth. Yours is a nice shade of red. Want to get more red? Isn't this beautiful enough? I can give you a couple blows, I'm feeling like hitting someone. -Why do you mess with Saisin and Mano? -Yeah. It's nothing to do with you being seniors. Want a fight? -Are you challenging me? -Yeah. You're juniors, don't you talk shit. A bit overconfident? You should know who comes first. Come on, bring it on. What are you gonna do? - Get away. - Kill them! -Go get Holy Father. Go! -Yeah. Stop fighting! Holy Father. Holy Father, there's a problem! -What problem? -Hurry up, Holy Father! -Brother... -Hurry up, we'll be too late. Calm down! -Holy Father. -Girls! -Girls! -Holy Father, stop them! -I can't! -Let's go! - I'm a monk. - They'll all get hurt! -Girls, stop! -Holy Father, stop them! Are you crazy? I'm a monk. I can't touch women. What are you gonna do? Huh? You want it? Tell them, brother. I said don't get into a fight! I said stop! This is getting out of control. I'm a monk. Who? -I'm sorry. -What should we do? What now, brother? Seriously, what are they fighting about? They are fighting for men. -Who? -Both of us. Handsome, huh? And why are those two fighting? - For a man. - Who, Holy Father? For me. Holy Father, your dad texted you. Are you sure? Yeah, look. The ID is "Deung Dao Dao Deuk Deuk." Deung Dao Dao Deuk Deuk. That's him, what did he say? He said... He's coming to Bangkok for the upcoming Songkran festival. - Oh, that's soon. - Yeah. -Send him a reply. -I'm sending it. "Come on over." Oh. Holy Father. Bad connection, it didn't go through. Oh. Saisin, why don't you ask the abbot what the Wi-Fi password is? Go yourself. I'm playing games. I'm chatting for Holy Father here. -You go yourself. -Come on, hurry up. - I'm playing games. - Brothers. What are you doing, Holy Father? Our temple's Wi-Fi. "Holy Father 4G Temple." Great. And tell Dad that I would like him to come. Okay, I'll tell him now. Battery is dead. Mano, the battery is dead. Do you have a spare one? Let me borrow it. -Yeah, I'll get it for you. -Thank you so much. Mano. -I told you to get the spare battery. -Hmm. Why did you bring a car battery? Here is the battery. I can't charge, there's no cable! I have one. Here. - But how do I... - Easy. Here, here, here, and... -Here. -Hey, it works! Holy Father, thank you. Hey, now, not too much. Well... Come get your blessing. -Pay off your parents' debts. -Ooh. Tak, there are so many people. Feed them well for good luck. Feed them poorly, you'll get bad luck. - Turn it off. - Listen up. Don't be blind about angel dolls. You better be blind about me. Oi. -Master, hello. -Hello! Takky, Pecky. Why don't you leave your shoes down there? What? Don't be ridiculous! How could we? You can't trust people these days. Two pairs last time. - Lost? - No, I took them. Father, I'm here for another blessing. Baby, give me good luck. Let me go back with triple luck. And I'll take you around the world in first class. Well, what can I do for you? You named her last time, but it sounds weird. People call her "Pussy, Pussy." Someone calls her "Little Pussy." Not nice. Can you rename her? Ah. Let me have a look. Give it to me. Little Pussy, go to Father. Be careful. Oh... Little Pussy, huh? Hmm. Change it to... Big Pussy. Big Pussy? Oh! Mr. Oot. Hello, Father. Everybody, that is all for today. We're closing. Go, hurry up. Mr. Oot is here. Don't get lost. Go ahead. Go, go. Mr. Oot, please. Please, take a seat. Please, sit down. Welcome. Father, I didn't know you had a pet pug. Or is it a toad to catch flies? You should go back. We've waited too long. It takes a lot of effort to meet with you! He made an effort to meet me too. Father, -we are your VIP customers. -Kung? We should be privileged. But Mr. Oot is a platinum member. Platinum, my ass! Look at him. Looks like he fell from a ten-story building. Come on, you should go back. Or do you want me to beg you? What, Father? Do you know how much we donate? It's uncountable. - What you sit on is-- - Father. What, is your face stiff? Too much Botox? You only keep saying "Father." You're like a Furby. Stop now! He gave such a large donation! The ordination hall, the roof, everything is his donation. Without him, how could I stay? Without a donor like Mr. Oot, I couldn't stay! You want a fight? We donate every time we come! This box is our donation, the money! I had your seat ordered, the Buddha's stand! And the ivory, the lanterns. What do you think, Tak? All the dogs here, -I donated them! -Hey! Stop, you stop! When you have celebrations, the drunken dancing guys, it's me who put them there! Without drunken guys, it wouldn't be a celebration! - Yeah! - Shut up! -Girlfriend, you kick ass! -Really? Attagirl. Don't leave your angel doll. I forgot. You, shut up. I'm telling you, I'm a very rich guy. I want to tell you all that I'm very rich. Rich from Chiang Mai to Bangkok. I tell you, my dad is rich, my mom is rich. I earn in one month as much as you do in your whole life. I can tell you that! Everything, I donate the seats-- Shut up! Didn't you see the rag when you came in? All the rags, I donated! You should know that! Aren't we great, huh? Aren't we? -So great-- -That's enough. If these two hags won't leave, will you talk to me outside? Uh... Take it off. Calm down. I have to apologize. What about the favor I asked you? Don't worry about that. I'm on it. I don't see Holy Father Sung. Where is he? He is trying to persuade the abbot to approve your project. Mmm. Don't just goof off all day. So they can't blame us. - Over there. - Where? Holy Father. -Oh. -Oh, gold damn it! Not really. It's, "God damn it." I never thought I'd see you here. Hormone. How did you get here? What are you doing? Why did you come here? How are you? What do you need? If nothing, see you later. -Let's go. -Hey. I haven't said anything. Uh... Hey, Saisin, Mano. I need to talk to Holy Father, my husband-to-be. Oh. -Both of you, move over there. -Go, go. Okay. Holy Father... I have something important to tell you. I went to see the doctor. -He told me that our baby-- -Will be born as a toad? No. Well, our baby... is not doing well. The baby will be physically challenged. You can't blame the baby. They probably get it from their mother's genes. That's not a big deal. There is a bigger problem. Uh... I just want to tell you that... I am not waiting anymore. If you are not going to leave the monkhood, I'll find a new boyfriend. There are many men waiting for me. Since you said that... I will make a decision... to be a monk for the rest of my life. Great! You're not leaving? Fine. I'll have an abortion! Let it die! We don't get to be parents! I won't come to this temple! Come on, Johnny. It's Paul. -You have too many names. -Okay, let's go. Wait a minute. Saisin, Mano, Holy Father. Help me clean up here. Go, Mano, farther. -Holy Father, is it clean? -No, a little more here. Sweep. Right there. So much here. Farther! Farther! Holy Father! Father, you can't let this continue any longer. If the Department of Religious Affairs finds out, - it will only be escalated. - Mmm. These two monks will get us all into trouble. Mmm. I've tried to resolve this many times, but nothing changes. You know who have their back. Or... Can you suggest any solutions? It's like the saying, "You can't hide a dead fish under a lotus leaf." Oh... Isn't it, "dead elephant"? Oh. It should be, "Dead fish rides a grasshopper." -Got it? -That can't be right. Thank you, everyone, for coming. Before you go home, Father Sung has something for you. I have amulets that I have charmed, to give to all of you. Model "Superbly Happy and Extremely Wealthy." I'll give one to everyone. All of them. Wait, wait, wait. And don't forget the one that Mr. Oot is creating. Model "Sawasdee Happy Thailand Reconciliation Season One." Holy Father, can I not take the amulet? Can I ask for some of the last two or three numbers of this April 16th lottery? Calm down, calm down. Everyone! All of you should stop being blind. You know... What you believe is not real. If these two monks can perform miracles, they should be able to show us. Holy Father, if you can perform miracles, can you fly now? Are you challenging me? Fine, 5:00 a.m. in front of the temple. -And you'll fly, huh? -I'll show you how to get alms. Should I laugh? Stop, Brother Jazz! Don't mess with our business. Even the abbot leaves us be. You are new, how could you? You better get this... Calm down. Be at peace, everybody. You saw it, right? Yeah. Have you seen it? - We've seen it. - Well... Interpret these lottery numbers as you wish, all right? Good luck, everyone. Huh? Thank you. Stop, everyone. Holy Father! - Have you all seen it? - Yes. It'll be 1-8, I bet. - Or 3-1-8. - How do you know? All right, all right. Let's see on April 16th what the result will be. See you then, Father Jazz! Let's go. Why did you pull me there? Holy Father. What? Why are you freaking out? The lottery number is out. Lottery? Don't tell me that-- - 18! - 18? Calm down, Holy Father Jazz is coming. Holy Father Jazz. Holy Father Jazz. Brother, why are they here? They went to your residence, so I brought them here. Not like that. I mean, why are they here? Why wouldn't they? You gave them the numbers. That's right. Yes. The two digits, 18. We've come to thank you. Oh. Uh, uh... Holy Father Sung, Holy Father Kung. What are you all doing here? To see Holy Father Jazz. Why don't you see me at my residence? Not anymore. Wait, wait, folks. I guarantee that I'll give you better numbers next time. But Holy Father Jazz does it better. Folks, all of you listen to me. The fact that you've won the lottery has nothing to do with me. Huh? Or with either of them. You won the lottery... ...because you were lucky. Now, I want you to be careful because you might encounter bad people who use religion to commit fraud. This will weaken the religion. Good luck, everyone. Sadhu! Don't forget to come to my residence. I'll be waiting. I won't miss this time. Holy Father Jazz. Since you gave them numbers, you have many devotees. What you said made us lose credentials. Yes. Holy Father, I'd never try to discredit anyone. And I'd never mock anyone. I'll give you three digits this time. Ha! Ha! Ha! Write it down, it's a code! No, he is being sarcastic. Huh? -Sarcastic? -Yeah! That's outrageous. Sis, calm down. Sis. My baby! My baby! My baby, you shouldn't have! What happened to your baby? My baby had... The Zika virus. Zika virus? Calm down, ma'am. Don't be sad. He is in a good place. How do you know he is in a good place? If it was a bad place, they'd all come back. How thoughtless you are. Holy Father, won't you say something? Don't forget to take your medicine. Yes. Holy Father! - Mano, wait up! - Holy Father! Hey. What's the matter? Where have you been? I helped them at the funeral. Can you... Can you believe this? Some people are unbelievable. They had a funeral for an angel doll. Yeah, a funeral like a real person. Mmm. Let them be. And where have you been? I went to a funeral. Whose? A man, a woman? - Angel doll. - What? Another one? That's why I'm not bewildered. Listen to me. Telling people not to believe is impossible. Anything that makes them feel better, let them hold onto it. It does no harm to others. That's good enough. Who's calling? Holy Father Sung. What's up? Where are you? Here at the residence. Great. Who are you with? By myself. Great. The abbot is asleep. The medicine works. I'll take him there. Let's get down to it. Come now. This is a good time. Hey, Mr. Oot, what brings you here? I just want to ask about the contract. What good timing. Holy Father Sung is coming here with the abbot. Father, easy. Straight, to the stairs. What's wrong with Holy Father? I don't know. That doesn't look good. Go hide inside. Holy Father. Holy Father Kung. Father. Please come in, Father. Close the door. Holy Father, how did you bring him here? We made it, just make him sign. Father. Father, this way. Please. How did you get him here? This is how we can bind him. Bind him? One moment. Wait! Where are you going? -To get a rope. -For what? Binding his hand to sign. Not like that! "Legally binding." After he signs the contract. Because he's going to sign. So, what's wrong with him? Say the prayers? Father! -Have him sign it. -Bring the contract. -Have him sign it. -Oh, oh, oh! Here, here, here. Let him go. Will he go down? Let's see what he'll do. There, there. Take a seat. Sit down. - A pen. - Here. Sign here, sign. Huh? Right here. Father, don't sign! What are you doing? Oh, nothing. We aren't doing anything. Tom, Somboy. Take him back to the residence. - What's behind you? - What? What? Nothing. - And that? - What? -Here! -All out. At the same time. Here, Holy Father. Is this the abbot's signature? Any lies you want to tell? Musā means "shall not lie." -But if we pull it off... -Then it's just fine. The abbot's symptoms are like those of a drunk person. Surā means alcohol... If we can afford it... Then it's just fine. This is not funny. This is annulled. And don't do this again. You're breaking a morality vow. Holy Father. What are you doing? You think people don't know? "Dhukka Dhee Dhukka Dhua Nua." What goes around comes around. Holy Father Jazz. You are troublesome. ♪ You said you wouldn't leave ♪ Here, Holy Father. My surprise. Where are you going? Where are you going? This guy here is the one who snatched your bag. Snatched what? Nothing. Here is the proof. -What proof? -Holy Father. We'll see. - Hey! - Ta-da! How's that? Whose is this? -Whose is this? -What? It's mine. - A lady bag? - I'm a ladyboy. Let go, don't you lie. Holy Father, -I'll call the police. -Don't! Holy Father. I have no choice, Holy Father. My family is poor. My sister is sick. -Please, I need it. -You can't be serious. Now that you admit it, I forgive you. -Oh! -Holy Father, why do you forgive him so easily? When he commits the wrong when in need, we should give him a chance. We live in the same world, we coexist. But you listen to me. Although you are poor, there are many other jobs. You should not commit crimes. You can be poor without losing your dignity. But Holy Father, promise me that you won't tell anyone. I promise. But you have to promise me, too, that you won't do this again. Yes, I promise. Be well. Thank you. Holy Father. Is it right to just let him go? Brothers, listen to me. We are men. An officer's life is full of suffering. Dignity isn't something to be bragged about. Hey, Jazz! Somebody's here. Go! You! Over there! Go get the abbot! Hurry! -Holy Father Jazz. -Holy Father! Nae! Holy Father Jazz! Holy Father! I got him, Mano! Hurry! -Nae! -Mano, hurry up! Holy Father Jazz. Holy Father Jazz. May all beings subject to birth, aging, illness, and death-- Who's dead, Father? Holy Father Jazz. Are you all right? Very much so, call the police. What a relief. Why call the police? He's alive. We have to call anyway. -I already did. -Call now. Officer, please come now. There were shots fired at the temple. There is a monk down, he is dead. You have to come, a monk is dead. Not so dead. That's all, thank you. It's done. What, is this, a shadow puppet show? Oh! I'm alive, Father. I had just come back from evening prayer and was walking back to my residence. There was a guy on a motorbike who called to me. Hey, Jazz! I turned around, then I heard a gunshot, so I tripped over. I thought you had an amulet. How fortunate. -What a pity. -Pity what? Uh, that we can't catch the bad guy. Yes. There, Sergeant. Officer, hurry up. And are you injured anywhere? I'm okay. How are you? How about Holy Father? Holy Father? Hurry! Sergeant, take him. Police and soldiers are really good these days. Holy Father Jazz, you better be careful when you go out. Yeah, you don't really know people. You can't trust anyone. It is hard to trust someone. Especially someone close to you. The best for you, Holy Father Jazz, is to go with Holy Father Sung and Kung. When you are shot at, they can take bullets for you. -Oh... -They have good amulets. I have to thank everybody so much for helping to catch the gunman. Please contact me when the case is resolved. Be well, officers. Yes, sir. Father. People are so generous. Old people, teenagers, children, they all come to give alms. I am so glad that Thai people come to the temple. Why don't they look at monks when they give the alms? I have many toothpastes. If I had teeth, I wouldn't complain. Looks like I have to eat toothpaste for breakfast. Won't you have a foamy mouth when you pray? Holy Father Jazz, meet your father under the Rama VIII bridge after breakfast. Somboy, don't forget our promise, lending the car. Sure. Mano. Just go slow, don't let anyone run into you. Why? Because I'll be in the car too. - Okay. - It'll be against the precepts. Don't fight! This is a good day! All four of us will meet again in the next life! Calm down! Don't fight. Love each other. Calm down. Saisin, what did you wish for? Me? I want a gang bang. Mano, Saisin! We should go, my father is waiting! Holy Father is calling us. We're making progress here. Come on. We have to leave. See you later. Don't fight. Bye-bye. Daddy. Uh... Father. Why don't you go with us? No, they will splash me. Oh! Come on. They won't splash monks. Holy Father. I thought you said they wouldn't splash monks. Your glasses fell off. Yeah, fell off. Upside down! You are so funny. When in Rome... Dad. Dad! Dad, is that you? Who are you? You don't remember me? Oh! Hello, Father. No, you're my father. Holy Father Jazz! -Yeah. -My son! -Let's go celebrate Songkran. -Are you sure, Dad? Make way, please! Please help me take care of him. You go ahead and play. Go. Holy Father. That's Baifern. She's with that cousin. That's not just a cousin. It's a very close cousin. They are so very close. Are you sad? He is just a cousin, Holy Father. Be well, ma'am. The band's called Jazz Sputnik Papillon Kuk Kuk. The lead singer is also called Jazz. Like you. Jazz! Hey, Jazz! Let's go. I thought he only looked like shit on TV. The real him is worse. Right? - Come on. - Holy Father Jazzy! Who called me? Over there. Hormone. Isn't she pregnant? How could she come out and play? Like a reunion day for me. I stumble upon people everywhere. Let's go. Meeting lots of people here. Come along. - Women are all the same. - Yes. When they get a new boyfriend, they forget. It's normal, Holy Father. - They are all the same. - Are you all right? Yes. If you can forget me, please do. Why, Holy Father? Because you made women pregnant? You don't know if it's your baby. That bitch Hormone is a slut, -a short runt. -Please. I will come to see you often. I won't leave you, no matter what. Very well. If you leave the one you love, it must be like Kong Huai Rai's song... "You Said You Won't Leave." "T-A-D." T-A-D what? - Think. Analyze. Distinguish. - I see. Please give us some space. Don't you have any kindness? Drive carefully. Easy. I'm afraid you can't get back in time. - Go slowly. - Yes, Holy Father. I'm sorry, Holy Father. Look, he doesn't have any kindness. People these days... Saisin, did I run into someone? I am in my lane. And this car tried to squeeze in. I didn't let him. I thought that most people were in line. And he bumped into my truck. He ran and knocked on my window. I was so scared. Here, he bumped into me. Look. And he tried to hurt me. A motorbike taxi driver over there came to help. That's how I survived. Meeting people like this, in this society, is so terrible. Thank you. What happened is unfortunate. But what I told you is the truth. I understand. A thing like this... You are right, but it can turn wrong. Social media these days is dangerous. There is a good side and a bad side. Hello, Holy Father. You are all here. So quiet. You are a star now, Holy Father Jazz. You have become an Internet idol. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, they all share your story. I heard that the TV program contacted you. You are so famous now. Listen... Sung, Kung. Holy Father Sung and Holy Father Kung, please come to see me tomorrow. Whoever does good deeds, heaven can see. Whoever does bad things, heaven can also see. They said "Karma on the rocket" in the old days. Now... "Karma is faster than 4G." SNOOP TALK Hello, everyone. Welcome to Snoop Talk. Today, we will talk about a clip on social media, it's been heavily criticized, about a red Yaris and a black Vigo. Now we have both of them here. Here's Holy Father Jazz from the red Yaris. -Greetings, Holy Father Jazz. -I wish you well. And another person, DJ Beng from the black Vigo. Hello. Hello. Hello. Let's hear from DJ Beng about how it happened. Well, I was in my lane, and then the red Yaris tried to squeeze in. I didn't let him, so he cut me off. I thought that there were many people in line. He tried to cut me off again. And he ran into me. So the red Yaris ran into you? -Yes. -Your black truck? Exactly. And he came to break my window. Hey! I was so terrified. Where has he gone? Holy Father. Get out. What? What? Why? Why? Holy Father. - You're a monk, calm down. - I was so scared. This is your point of view. Can I ask Holy Father? Of course. Holy Father Jazz, he said on that day, you took the wrench and broke his window. How did it happen? It was actually an accident. I saw the accident, and he had a puncture. Want me to go with you? I took the wrench just in case I'd need to change the tire. Brother? -Where are you? -Why, Holy Father? Why? Give me a moment. What do you want? No... -Brother, listen to me. -Listen to what? That's not true. Not true. He was going to hurt me like this. -Like that? -He lifted his hand like this. So, Holy Father? He said, yeah, like that. Yes, just like that. That's not all. Do you have anything to say to the audience? As I am a monk, and I'm sitting here telling the truth to everyone. If you don't believe, I am willing to take all the blame. I always think... good men... never die. Be well. All right, everybody, let's take a short break. Snoop Talk will return. Stop crying. Where are you two going? Who are you looking for? -Hello. -Hello. Is Holy Father Jazz here? Holy Father Jazz has left. Just now. -I was the driver of the red Yaris. -Aof? The red Yaris driver is here. Bring him in? Take Holy Father's place. Come here. - Go out there. - Come here, take a seat. Are we ready? Let's continue here, okay? Everyone is ready? Aof, ready! Five, four, three, two... Welcome back to Snoop Talk. We have the red Yaris driver here. These are two young men. Hello, brothers. - Hello. - Hello. Can you tell us the story? Because DJ Beng already told his side about what happened, and also the video clip. So what happened that day? It was like, after the crash... It was an accident. Holy Father had good intentions. He took the wrench because he saw the flat tire. What tire? Wait, listen to me. Good intentions? Good intentions. This is the story from the red Yaris driver. But there is the full video clip on the net right now. A well-wishing viewer sent it over. Let's have a look at the whole situation. Calm down, brother. Calm down. Believe me, calm down. That's a monk... Holy Father, run. What's going on? That clip was edited. - Are you sure? - It was edited. I'm being framed, I'm innocent. What do you think about this? Is it what happened that day? Yes. Anything you want to say to the viewers? Yes, there is. Which camera? Oh. Hello. Mommy, I'm on television! I'm here to help Holy Father Jazz. These are the stories from both sides, DJ Beng and the red Yaris driver. That's the updates and the full footage for you. Take these into consideration. That's all from Snoop Talk. See you again at the same time on Channel 8. Goodbye for now. See you next time. Please give me sympathy. Meeting people like this, in this society, it's terrible. I'm innocent, I'm not like that. They edited it. You have to believe me. Take it easy. -Matt! -I've been framed. Your reverence. What is this all about? Police? Soldiers? Have you been arrested? Or you must have been called in for an attitude adjustment? Actually, you have to ask these officers, Holy Father Sung, Holy Father Kung. I have to invite both of you to testify about your involvement in the case of attempted murder and fraud by Mr. Oot. Please, come with us. You have come to the wrong place. Wrong place. Who would do that? We only have good monks. This is a misunderstanding. -Please, go back. -Go, go, go. Sergeant, bring both of them in to testify. Please, Holy Father. Please what? I'm busy. No, no, no. We can talk here. Don't touch us. You are going to force us? - You can't take us. - Calm down. -What are you doing? -Record it. -Calm down, Holy Father. -Don't flock in. Bring the camera, record it. We have evidence. Don't come in. Don't. Holy Father, calm down. Think carefully. With this clip, people will know you bullied us. -Look. Soldier, lock up the monk. -No, you are locking him up. We have come to this point. You should confess. Admit your mistake, society will forgive you. Officers, if you will proceed, I want to ask them to leave the monkhood first. -Leave? -All right, Father. Father. Father. I've done wrong, Father. I didn't mean it. Everything was Mr. Oot's plan. I wanted money to buy a jet for the temple. Uh... I mean... Sergeant, take them. Where is Holy Father? I think we should call him. It's ringing. -Hello? -Hello, is that Holy Father? Holy Father is not here. Holy Father's phone is with you. Damn, you let me keep talking. Saisin, check this out. "Holy Father Jazz, the renown deceiving monk has become a street ghost. His body is now at the hospital." Let's go. Hurry! Holy Father, please be safe. Where are you rushing off to? -To Holy Father Jazz. -What happened to him? He was hit by a car. -How do you know? -Here. You've been fooled by net trolls. This is a fake page. -Are you sure? -Of course I am. We've just met him a while ago. And he left you a message that he is going back to the province. This fake page admin is an asshole. Hurting people with his unthinkable act... Luckily, you and I are smart, -or we would have become victims. -True. - Go. - Go where? Pack up the hill, back to clothes. Pack to clothes, back up the hill. Come on. "Pack up the clothes, back to the hill"? Mmm. Wherever you stay and feel calm, that's the place you belong. Don't try to be stubborn. How could you stay here? It's so high. Tom, wait up. I haven't been up here in a while. So tired! -Are you all right? -Just take care of yourself. Father. Father. Greetings, Father. Greetings, Father. Mano, Saisin, you have come back from Bangkok. We've been back for a while. What's the matter? Is Holy Father Jazz here? He is not here. Didn't he come here? Yes, he did. But he is not here. This monk is a pain in the ass. What did you just say? Um, this minute I have a pain in my ass. Oh! That's normal because we're on the mountain. Walking up here hurts. What hurts, Father? Feet. Father, where is Holy Father? Up there. Up there? Holy Father! Holy Father Jazz! Don't make noise in the temple. Holy Father, will you really leave the monkhood? Why? I have been thinking about it. I can't be a good monk. And I can't lead the religion in the right way. If a good monk like you left, who would take care of religion? You guys can. Little punks like us? That's right. You have never been a monk. You don't know what it's like. Isn't that right, Holy Father Tee? That's right, Holy Father. Do you know... that being a monk... helps shape our mind to be a good person? I, alone, can't do much. But if we're all together, we might be able to do a lot for religion. Isn't that right, Holy Father Tee? That's right, Holy Father. Thank you so much. With Holy Father Tee here, I feel relieved. Everything feels right. We never disagree about anything, right? That's right, Holy Father. There. Noh, hurry up. Come. Stay away! Don't come near me! You would've hit me! Wait. What film are you shooting? -Honey, you... -I'm tired. Holy Father. No, it looks like natural laughing. Another knock and my head will be broken. I always thought that... I always thought that... I always believed that... Come on! Wait! Go sit down. I'll forget the lines. Holy Father, this way is correct. You mean this way? Or this way? It's virtuous to be hit by a Buddhist scripture. Hopefully, it will enlighten you both. Dol! Dol, dol, dol, dol! There's no way this will slip. Dol, dol, dol, dol! Dol, dol, dol, dol! That's enough. Wait, the wig slipped. She really got hit. -My stomach hurts. -The baby is coming! Won't you help? Cut! Your tummy moves, doesn't look like you are giving birth. Holy Father. Too close, brother. In the monk... Holy Father, let's change our clothes and go play with the water. Brother, can you check if my alms bowl is empty? Let me see. It's empty all right. Another take. I'm stunned. Monday, Tuesday... Thieves now steal from the Prime Minister's wallet? This is not the Prime Minister's! Oops, forgot. Is Holy Father here? Yes, but he's up there. -Poom. -Yes? I think your chin has been short lately. You should refill it. Or you won't remember your line. That's good, Holy Father, to be ordained... Who's laughing? I'm sorry. Who laughed? Slate, cut! The faith of people, brother, brother. "Holy Father"? How can you let this happen... How can you let this... Holy Father, wait up. We'll have to run first. Punk kid. Falling down. What are they doing? Is it? Is this... Does he know? What? What is it? Can we cut? My angel! See? Angel dolls are real! My angel! Ma'am, the temple forgot to pay the electricity bill. Shit! Crazy bitch! Cut!
