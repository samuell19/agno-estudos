Alexis? Are you okay? Are the kids okay? Yeah. They're fine. They're fine. That was so real. They ran away. And I could hear the kids yelling, like, far away and I could see their footprints on the sand. I followed them. But I couldn't go in the water. It was like it was glass. And I'm hitting the water, but it's like a window at an aquarium. And I could see the kids looking at me and I'm just... It's just a dream. It's not real. No, David. It was so real. I have to clean the kitchen. What? Now? Yes. Favvy's coming. She judges. Dude, fuck Favvy. - Don't curse my sister. - Sorry. Daddy, my tooth is wiggly! Is it ready to come out? Yeah, here, let me see it. - Let me see, let me see. - You're going to pull it out. No I won't. I just want to see it, okay? Open your mouth. Go "ah." Open. - This one, right? - Mm-hmm. Oh, wow. It is loose. - Does it hurt you? - Mm-hmm. Okay, honey. Daddy! Hey, look, if you swallow it you can't get all the money from the Tooth Fairy. Can I have $10? What? For a tooth? Christ, I thank you for this bounty and your blessings. I will serve as an instrument of your will this day. Please send your guardian angels to watch over my wife and children, her mom, Janet, and sister, Faviola, and Jazmin. Almighty God who lives and rules the world without end, amen. - Amen. - Amen. Okay, the big date... what happened? So, he takes me to this really nice steak place. Is the dude on Tinder? Did he super like you? I am on Tinder, David, because not everyone won the marriage lottery. I can't believe you're on Tinder. - Alexis. - David, stop. Hey, what's up, sis? All this food for Jazmin's quince? What? I'm hungry, and it smells good. Mija, you are so pretty. Hey, can I do her makeup? - No. - We have someone. You want to help us? We have to start shredding the pork. Mommy, my eyes burn. Baby, fix the alarm. Fix it? It's doing what it does. It's all smoky in here. Open up a window. - Oh, mami. - Take the battery out. Chill with the chilis for one second. - I got to go, okay? - Take Dylan to his game. I can't. I'm late. Listen, I'll take him. I'll take Dylan, okay? I have to go to the store anyway. Thank you, Favvy. Hey, we have to get your dress. Hey, when do you get the dress? What color is it? Favvy, I'm going to pay for the dress. No, no, no, no. No, seriously. It's done. I'm going to cover the dress. Jazmin, can you help me cut the tomatoes, please? - Take of your brother, okay? - Okay. - Bye, Dad. - Alright, I love you. ♪ Yeah ♪ Last night he caught a body ♪ Last night he caught a body ♪ Last night he caught a body ♪ Last night he caught a body ♪ Last night he caught a body ♪ Tru-Tru in the blue coupe ♪ Doggystyle like woof woof ♪ Came to take my shit back ♪ Trap, trap, trap, I peel...

That's not an invitation. That's you saying come through 'cause I asked you. A real invitation is like a nice card with lace edges and shit. Well, don't fucking come through then. I want to come through. I'd like to support your family. I know Alexis gets uncomfortable around me so I stay away. If you got beef with Alexis, go have coffee with her. You got her number, homey. Coffee, yeah, yeah. I'll call her up. You really wanted a printed invitation? Yes. They're like 20 bucks each. I thought it would be a nice souvenir. Jazmin's a nice girl. Yo, how is it you don't have no kids, huh? Condoms, IUDs, birth control pills, morning after pills, plan A, plan B, plan C. - There's a lot of options, boy. - You're going to hell, man. Yeah, but I'm at peace with that. I'm not going to argue about Jesus with you. You ever meditate? No. No? No, I don't fuck with that. That shit's satanic. Okay, so some people say yoga's satanic. Some people. They do. I'm doing that mindfulness shit. The fuck is that? So first thing in the morning... - Yeah? - Clear my head of noise. Boom. Focus on my breathing. Observe my thoughts. Then I lean into my day. Are we killing anybody today? I've got fucking nice shoes on. Guppi. That's good work. That's clean lines. You mind if I do that? It's always been a dream of mine, huh? One thing. You got what we came for? - Hmm? - Bag. Looks good. Creeper, stop. Mm. How was the funeral? You know, kind of sad. There's family, so laying kids and shit out there. Sorry about your boy, homey. I am. Dude had a family but he also knew the reglas. He made his decision. We made ours. I'mma take that green light off of you, okay? You show your face, you walk the block, you conduct your business in safety. Thank you. Motherfucker got himself killed and had four fucking kids. Why would you fuck with that? You got the money, pay the fucking money. It's greed. These guys are fucking criminals. It's in their nature to cheat the system. It's nothing new. It could happen to us. - No. - A short count, or we end up on the wrong side of the politics, - I mean, we'll get smoked. - Hey. You're connected as fuck. No one is touching you never. Hey, homey, that shit smells like ass. This? This is fish. It's going to have an odor. Like summertime dead body nasty. Well, I'm not going to apologize for it. Maybe you're too sensitive. I've got way more energy on this diet. That's not a good thing. You want this last piece? No, I don't want it. Throw that shit out the fucking window. Hey, what's up big dog? It's been a minute. You good? Okay, let me get into it, homey. Don't trip. I got you. Side mission, dawg. What's up, holmes? Wake up. He fucked the homey's lady. The vato dropped all his cash on an engagement ring and then finds this puto's number on her fucking phone sexting the fuck out of her. Come on. So let's squash this before shit pops off. What do you want me to do? Cut him loose and clean him up. You guys can't do this shit. These ain't Vietnam, homey. We got business with the Bloods. The homeboy needs to check his lady, not the motherfuckers piping her, okay? Alright, David. My bad. Get the motherfucker in here. Hey, Pete. Four-five this motherfucker. Motherfucker. Look, they got the homey. What the fuck, hey? Hold up, hold up. What's up with it? Hold the fuck up, Blood. What the fuck, man? No disrespect. It wasn't business, and it wasn't racial. Just some young guns tripping personal. Checked those responsible. Got your boy before it got crazy, man. I'mma keep it G with you, David. And I know you've got your chess pieces and for sure I've got mine. But I want all this shit to die today. I want to walk away clean and focus on the business, you know what I'm saying? You're a candle in the darkness. Keep that shit real with you. You didn't have to do that. Yeah, I did. Bone helped me solve some problems back in the day, so... 60, right? There you go. It's all there. Show it to me. Okay. It's been kind of slow right now, you know? A lot of college kids out of town. Got that hook up though on that good molly if you need it. Got two homeys out of San Francisco. They slinging their shit left and right to all them Silicon Valley motherfuckers. Everybody wants, like, acid and LSD. It's crazy up there. They microdose now. They take these small doses every day. It's supposed to make them more creative or some shit. Took acid every day for a month straight but big fucking doses. Big. Made me feel like I was metal wire and fucking alien shit flying all over the place. - Damn, homey. - Fucking weird, fool. Hey, I don't want to break it up or nothing but if you guys know of a good chemist, let me know. Adderall too, you know what I mean? Yeah, it's like popcorn to these college kids. Trust me when I tell you. I'll ask around. The Paisas, man, they're giving us great competition, you know? They don't pay no taxes so their... their prices are better. You can't make no money 'cause a border brother's got better prices? Whoa, hey, whoa, whoa. I understand. Yellow is one of my favorite colors. 45 minutes. Where on earth is David? Hey, you good? The dress isn't happening today. The Mexican Kardashians got here before us. - And they're closed tomorrow. - Are we going to get my dress? Yes, we are going to get your dress, mami, don't worry. Babe, I really need your help. Okay. We can't let this ruin her quince. Let me get into it. Alright, give me 15 minutes. Thank you, baby. Fuck. - Vamonos. - We got here first. It's my wedding dress. - Bye. - Vamonos. I've been waiting the whole week for this. Bye. - Okay, let's get this done. - Where is the dress? - Definitely not that one. - Let's see. You've got a connect out of San Diego Chicano Park who's given you 30 pounds of meth a week since April. So you owe back taxes on 120 pounds. You got 50 grand? Alright, let's call it a day. I've got to get back to the ranch, homey. Daddy! Tía Favvy took us to In-N-Out. Where's Alexis? In the room napping. How'd the dress work out? Thank you. No, for real. It's so cute. Jazmin is so happy. - Babe? - Hmm? What's up? The count's 20 grand short. Are you sure? Shit, I mean, I don't count it. It's Big Loma's gang. Motherfucker. It's a new guy, and he didn't know how much they owed and I forgot to check the kite from the little girl and I was running late to hit all the neighborhoods. It's okay, it's okay. Calm down, baby. Look, I have a little float that I keep week to week for this kind of thing. But we can't afford to cover other people's mistakes. Is that Wizard? - Yes? - Listen up. Collection needs to go smooth this month. I've got something big happening. No fuck ups. I understand. Put the fool on. I know he's in there. Yeah, just a second. He wants to talk to you. Yes, sir. Hello. Just heard him laughing and then he hung up. What did he say? He said that there's a lot going on this week and he needs this week's taxes to go smoothly. No mistakes. Is he fucking listening to us? Is this fucking place bugged? Calm down, calm down. Calm down, baby. Calm down, okay? Go relax. Go have a beer. Go play with the kids. Then you're going to go back out, okay? Finish your paper route so I can package all of this up and get it out of our house, okay? Okay. Okay. You owe me 20 fucking grand, homey. I gave you basic fucking instructions. He'll splatter your brains all over your old lady. You don't want that. I don't want that. And she sure as shit don't want that. I do. I want that. Hey, this guy, he wants that. I want that, Victor. I'm asking you, homey, why would you do that? - Open your mouth. - Okay! I'll take your bitch as collateral and put her in my fucking truck until you make it right, homey. - I'll make it right. - Huh? - I'll make it right. - I can't hear you. What the fuck are you saying, homey? I'll make it right. - What? - I'll make it right. In the freezer, there's a TV dinner. What kind of fucking TV dinner? I'm on a special diet. The money's in the freezer. You were hiding the money, Victor. - I'm sorry. - Why? Why did you think to fucking do that, Victor? My little girl's got leukemia and we ain't got no insurance. Victor, you think I'm stupid, homey? This motherfucker. Try again. Why did you hide the fucking money, Victor? My little girl's got leukemia, man. I'm sorry. Prove it. This morning in the children's hospital. He's lying, David. What's her name? Isabella. - How old is she? - Five. - Where was she born? - Montebello. What am I doing? David, what am I doing? - Hm? - Hold up. Fuck. Don't, David. Let's go, Creeper. That's your fucking problem, right there. You can't compartmentalize. You're taxing 43 different street gangs. That's thousands of dudes in the most violent, fucked-up subculture in Los Angeles, and you want to play the fucking pope out here. You need to know when to shut the fuck up Creeper. Alexis is going to fuck your shit up. Yeah, I already fucking know, homey, I already know. I already know, alright? Don't got to fucking remind me. What the fuck? What? Hey, we got to go see Venom from Hillside. 200 fucking grand. Hillside Trece 200 grand? - Yeah. - Wow. They must have had a serious fucking come-up over there, huh? Let's take their money. I already fucked every bitch in their hood. David? Yeah. Alright. Have a seat. Drink some pista, holmes. You know I ain't here to socialize. Your uncle used to do your job. Him and that fat fuck Spanky. Went to all the different gangs in the neighborhood making collects. You're only here because of your fucking daddy. I earned my way to the top. I'm here to collect your fucking taxes. So put your fucking money on the table, stop opening your fucking mouth, and do as you're fucking told. I got the money. That ain't the problem. Put the fucking fetty on the table right now or it's your last supper, I promise you, my boy. Right now. This isn't yours. Who the fuck are you? I'm the future and you the past. So Venom, he work for me now. And all this right here, it's my money. Who the fuck are you? Okay, Conejo. Because it's not a mistake. It's a motherfucking earthquake, and everything get knocked down. Let's go, Creeper. I got a .380 on each ankle, .38 on my right, .25 on my left, chopper in the trunk, Glock in my belt, fuck. Don't get too fucking excited, homey. It's just a lot of fucking cash, you feel me? You know my uncle whacked Venom's dad. And he wants to cut your heart out for sure. You say the word, I'll push that bitch's wig back. - I don't want that, Creeper. - I'm on it. Who is he? Who's Conejo? It's a confident move, taking Wizard's money. He's got to be connected as fuck. I know who he is. Some fucking West Side heavy hitter. Remember he kidnapped people? Fucking cut them up, burned that dude one time, sent a video tape to his mom. Fucking straight-up street terrorist. But Wizard was going to have him taken out. So he bounced down to Mexico. He's been MIA for like 10 years. Conejo, fuck that puto, hey? Fuck him. I'll skin that motherfucker. You should have let me have him. I need to put it to a vote. I need 24 hours. It's got to go down the right way. You're scared of him. The fuck did you say? If you weren't my nephew, I'd stick your fucking face in that fire until you stopped moving. Alright, holmes? I ain't scared of any bitch-made motherfucker, alright? Hey, and you don't leave till I fucking tell you to leave. Sit your fucking ass down. You're going to mind somebody, huh? You're my nephew and I love you and you're bad, David, but you ain't fucking that bad, alright? Now bounce. Marisol, give me a plate. Alexis. Alexis. What did you see in me when we met? I told you this a thousand times. No. There's the story you tell everyone again and again because you like telling it. And people like hearing it. And then there's the truth. I want that. The truth. Okay. You remember when we met? The King Taco in South Central? I'll never forget. You were acting all stupid gang banging with your cousins back then. Yeah, whatever. We were kids. That wasn't the first time I saw you. What do you mean? See, a couple of weeks before you met me my dad got really, really drunk. I hear all this noise, and I come out of my room, and my dad is beating my mom with a chair. He beat my mom until the chair broke. And my mom is bleeding and crying and he looks at me, and he starts walking towards me and I'm thinking, "I'm dead." He just walked right past me. Didn't say anything. Just walked into his room and slept for like two days. So I heard about you, and you were this big bad gangster who killed people. So here I am, some Mexican-American princess, I go down to the hood, figured out where you hung out. I was going to get you to fall in love with me and get you to kill my dad. Half the plan worked. Thank God. He stopped drinking. David, what's wrong? People always want something from me. You didn't want nothing from me. That's what I thought. I love you. There you are. Take it from him. Now reverse it. Ooba, ooba towards me. That's established properly. Armbar, take it, take it. Merry Christmas. Outstanding. - Alright. - Good job, man. Okay, go. Attack, attack, attack. Tuck your chin. Give him the ribs, punch his ribs. Slow down, technique first. Take your time. Don't rush it. Come on, David. Handle it, handle it. Good. Good, good, good. That's it. Good. Wake up and smell the roses, not your own blood. - Make sense? - Yeah. You got a drink for us? Thank you. That's it there. That's it. That'll work there. Thank you. - Gentlemen, how are you? - Hi, Tío. Jazmin, happy birthday. Honey. David, you know it's a party, right? Take your shot, come on. Come on. You've been babysitting all night. Come on, David. - Fuck him. - Alright, fuck it, whatever. Hey, what's up, Johnny Cash? What? You're trying to be all cool over there to impress your little lady friend and shit? Come take a shot with us. Come on. This is some bomb-ass tequila. Hey don't get him fucking drunk, dude. Just one shot. One. Hey, Creeper, I've seen your ass drunk, fool. You cry like a little bitch and shit. I've been nothing but a gentleman to you. How many fucking favors have I done for you? - How many? A lot, a lot. - Oh, yeah, tons of favors. Yeah, hold on, let me count them. How about that time you gave me like three different STDs and shit. Are you fucking kidding? Dude, did you fuck him without a condom? - You're fucking nasty. - She's kidding. She's fucking... I have a bunch of condoms. You're going to need them. I tell you what, you go out to the parking lot and your car's on fire, now you know why. Oh, now I know why my car's on fire. Hey, Creeper, I Ubered here. Hold that shit, though. Pass that shit out. Hey, hey, no, no. You're not fucking smoking weed in my backyard with Alexis right here. - No. - Dude, come on. She used to be cool as fuck. I know what it is. You talked to Dad? No. No? Since when no? Just no. Okay? He don't want to talk to me. Think he cares what I have to say? Hey, Dad's version of being a dad is opposite day. Hey. Sorry. Dance with me. David, I'm going to take care of that thing that we talked about, okay? It's all good. When I'm done with Conejo, he's going to wish he stayed in Mexico selling fucking tacos. Hey, Conejo's getting his ass aired out. I want what you got with Alexis. You got your wife, you've got your kids, you've got your castle. You go out there, you come back here, you're fucking safe behind these walls. Fuck. I'm always living my life on point. You know, I'm always watching for the fucking bullet. I love my family. I love God. Oh, fuck me. God allows me to walk through darkness and come back into the light. I have two worlds. You can too. You think God's going to have me, fool? - He will. - Mm-hmm. God doesn't exist. I'm a product of evolution, David. I'm supposed to terrorize the herd. That's my function. That's the knowledge I was born with. Don't say that. You know, I've seen so many motherfuckers die. So many. And when the lights go out, it's just a fucking pile of meat left. That's it. So I know when I die, I die. That's the end of the book. I see so many motherfuckers begging, pissing, shitting themselves for one more fucking second of life, and when I'm there pulling their card, I'm their God when I'm there. When I'm there, I'm God. Nice house. What the fuck is she doing here? The fuck are you doing here? Be too bad if somebody firebombed it and killed all these fucking people. Bitch, I'll cut your fucking legs off. Don't you check your fucking phone? Your uncle wants you to sit down with Conejo. Says we have to make it right. Fuck you. You come into my fucking house. Why the fuck should I trust you? Baby. Better fucking hurry. Wow. Hey, fool, that's like the female you. You guys should get married and have evil babies and shit. I ain't going to lie, my boy, I'm intrigued as fuck. Where's my uncle at? The real decisions are made far from here. I'm not going to sit here and listen to a fucking TED Talk. I was told that my uncle was here. So where the fuck is he? See, when you kill a man and you don't kill his sons, this is what happens. Sometimes it take a minute for that bullet to hit its target. Just following orders. I want you to understand that I'm not a threat to you. As a matter of fact, I'm the only hope you got. ¿Palabra? You actually thought that your uncle could help you. Nah, little homey, only you could do that. For how many years have they promised to open up the books, have you made into a boss in the organization? All you got to do is kiss the ring and join the family and I'll give you something that your uncle and Wizard have kept from you all this time. If Wizard wanted to, he could give you more power than you could handle with just a nod. ♪ Nothing to see, babe ♪ When the lights are on You said we were protected. You knew who I was and what my family was. Should we run? There's nowhere to run, and they'd find us. I'm sorry I'm scared. The kids... Alexis, these are international players worth billions, and Wizard and Conejo are fighting it out right now. I got my small slice of the game. They're way up there. And I'm down here. And I ain't shit. We can't join them, we can't run, what's left? I want to fight him. Okay. I trust you. I can't surrender to Conejo. He's demonic, and I feel it. Tell me what to do. Don't change a thing. Conejo's watching you. They won't see it coming. He worked on the number-two guy in Jalisco. He's got someone in T.J. Get him anything he wants at anyway to San Diego. He's probably got a fucking tunnel. It seems like it, so he can just clip killers for his mission. Is no one concerned his uncle's head was in a fucking beer cooler? Where's Wizard in all of this? I mean, we could use the high-powered help right now. I need you to find me this lame motherfucker so I can kill him. I'm working on his location. Well, work harder. The guy's streetcraft is bulletproof, alright? He sleeps in hotels, different apartments. Doesn't trust anyone, always on the move so no one knows where he's going to be hour to hour. Look, he rolls with a couple of rock star shooters. One guy's up from the Marine Corps Special Forces. The other one's a former lieutenant in the federal Mexican SWAT team. Wow. They're players, and they got heavy weapons. Are we not going to talk about the elephant in the room, David? Is Wizard next? Shut the fuck up. David, get your family and get the fuck out of LA until we handle this for you. No. Nobody's untouchable. If it's about money, we have money for you. - Yeah sure, it'll help. - Okay. But we can do this. We just need some time. Maybe a few weeks. Hey. You got some of the best fucking soldados in the game right here. Look around, my boy. Every single one of these motherfuckers will ride with you till the wheels fall off. Now I'm going to hit Conejo, and I'm going to keep hitting until one of us is dead, and so will he, and so will he, and this sick fuck right here, you don't think he wants to spill blood, David? These are fucking riders, David. We got you. Let us do this now. Okay. Let's go. Bang bang. Conejo's definitely connected to the cartel. Plus they give zero fucks. I mean, this guy has the power to turn out the entire game up here. I need you tell me how to get to this lame motherfucker, that's what I need from you. I just need some time. You've got a millionaire and a stone pillar. - Fuck! - Fuck! Run, run! Hey. But I ain't going to give you nothing but pain. Hey, puto. I'm going to need some copies of that ASAP. Okay. I'm sorry.
