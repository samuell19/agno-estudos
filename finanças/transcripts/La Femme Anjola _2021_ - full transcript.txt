My mom struggled to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table. I managed to finish secondary school. Performed very well. Got admission into university, but... there was no money. So, I got a job instead. And Odera? That was the job. I was a receptionist at his car sale showroom in Surulere. He walked in one day... took one look at me, and married me three weeks later. Somewhere in there, I missed the part where you fell in love with him. What's love got to do with it? He had me in his bed every night and I went from eating one packet of noodles a day to three square meals. From buying used clothing at "bend down selects", to having Lanre Da Silva design for me. It was an arrangement that worked for both parties. He was really good to me at first. Paid for my mom's hospital bills before she passed. Paid for me to go to university. [EMOTIONAL MALE VOCALIST IN BACKGROUND] But that was just foreplay. A kick here... a punch there... a slap when I go, or act out of line. He often reminds me that I'm his property. His possession. That he owns me. DEJARE: How do you manage to sneak away from him? Salon... Spa appointments, gym... fitting of clothes. A girl will always find excuses to leave the house.

He walked into my hotel room and told me that... if I didn't return home before nightfall, he would have me killed. He left the plane ticket on the dresser, and walked out. I thought of heading north to Kaduna, but I know Odera. He would have left someone behind to track me. So I caught the flight. The beating he gave me! It took me a whole month to recover.

Whilst working there, did you notice anything out of the ordinary? Superintendent, I only play the sax. Have you any idea who might have wanted Mr. Kalu dead? To be honest, I hardly knew the man. ANNIE NWOSU: When last did you see him? About a week ago...at the club. ANNIE NWOSU: Were you outside the club on Saturday night when a drive-by shooting occurred? No. You worked with his wife, Anjola, right? Amongst other members of the band. How were things between Mr. and Mrs. Kalu? From what I saw, they seemed okay. but for the most part, I was an outsider. The club manager...Oscar Nnamani we'd like to talk with him, but his whereabouts are unknown. Any idea why or where he might be missing? I never saw him outside the club.

My relationship with Mrs. Kalu.. is strictly professional. Did you ever think of hitting it? No. She is my boss's wife! Yeah. We questioned her a few days ago And I won't lie to you... All the while we were with her.. all I was thinking of, is what it will be like... to get in between her soft, yellow, moist thighs. Oh well, but as you said, ah, she's your boss's wife.

La Femme Anjola! I gave her that stage name, you know? Me! I felt the French in it would make it more...exotic, edgy We used to hang out after rehearsal. Nothing happened at first... but gradually, it got physical. Until she started dropping hints about knocking off her hubby, saying it was the only way she could leave him... the only way she could escape his beatings. Odera is a bastard. An asshole even! But, walahi, I swear, I never for once saw him lay a finger on her. So I got to thinking that she was making it all up just to get my sympathy. The babe is really pretty. But I beg...I wasn't going to kill anybody! Seriously now, for what? I can hustle here and there, even sleep with another man's wife But...murder? Murder shall not be my case! So what happened next? Next thing I know, I'm being summoned to Odera's car sales office in Surulere. As I entered the place, Odera rushed me, and beat the hell out me. Apparently she had reported me to him that I was toasting her! How now...how? Odera ordered Okilo... to smash my knees, bro! Now I'm in this damn wheelchair for the rest of my life! When I heard about Odera's murder in "City People", I knew...that Anjola had finally pulled it off. But how? How? She needed an accomplice. But I guess... that was you, huh? Mhm...right? Mr. GQ...

I caused a scene, just in time for you. I bet you didn't know I could act. So why fake Odera's murder in the first place? Odera was broke. The houses, car shop, the club, all na wash.
