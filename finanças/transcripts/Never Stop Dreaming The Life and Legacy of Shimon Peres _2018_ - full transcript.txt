An extraordinary gathering took place at Israel's Mount Herzl Cemetery in Jerusalem on September 30th, 2016. An event unlike any other since the Jewish state's founding in 1948. It included presidents and prime ministers, kings and queens, religious leaders and international dignitaries. They had all come to attend the funeral of Shimon Peres, Israel's ninth president, a three-time prime minister, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and one of the most respected and beloved elder statesmen in the world. The day before, thousands upon thousands of Israelis young and old, from all walks of life and backgrounds, also paid their respects. They had gathered to honor a man born in a place that few, if any, had ever heard of in Central Europe, assembled together in a country that did not formally exist when Shimon Peres arrived on its shores in 1934. He was a young firebrand whose visions of the future startled his mentor, Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion. A sometimes controversial figure on the political scene, he was a hawk who built Israel's military and then he negotiated a peace treaty and became a dove. Active well into his 90s, Shimon Peres worked not for personal gain, but to benefit the country he helped to found and loved until the day he passed away. Shimon Peres was called a dreamer. There were times when that description was more of a criticism than a compliment, but his detractors never stopped him from continuing to dream. People said that I'm a dreamer. It's true. But ask me this: What's wrong? Who said people who don't dream are right? The way he lived his life and the choices that he made based on a notion that dreams are where it starts, you know, dreams and not fantasies. I think a lot of people sometimes found the scale of the vision too utopian, but he never meant it to be something that existed only in theory. For him, it was always about uniting the theory with a very practical implementation. Shimon was a man of action. He did not waste time. In his vision and as a statesman, he did tremendous things. His original approach to things, his different approach to things, he was not like all the others. He had his own way of thinking. People were always amazed that no matter how old he got, first, he looked good, and he stayed young in mind. Made him young at heart. That's how he kept going. He was able to just let go of the most unimaginable disappointments and the deepest frustrations... and he never gave up on anybody. I think this is the kind of man that teaches that leadership must be optimistic and think about how to forge a better tomorrow together. He was constantly working on ways to improve the life of a lot of people. There were discouraging moments, but never to allow the discouraging moments to... cause him to retreat from doing what he loved to do. I think that fundamental optimism in him was something that was why, unlike many people who seem to fade as they get older, he seemed to constantly draw more energy and... become more of a magnet. Including among young people, as he got older, because he never lost that quality. He was gifted with the ability to listen to others who did not share his views, and still remain determined to find a path forward. President Peres was all about love and compassion. He was a giver, not a taker. My father's life was a journey from an old land to a new land. From an old era to a new era. Inspired by our prophets, he was a harmony of contradictions. On one hand, very realistic. On the other hand, a dreamer. Being an optimist, being positive, using your imagination, never giving up, always look at the future, is part of the DNA of his vision. I don't have patience to sit and watch. I want to be a participant, and clearly, in the march to the future. I don't like to sit on my chair and wait ten years until something new will arrive. I prefer to run, to move, to think, to be surprised. Always be optimistic, but never be satisfied. Go ahead. Dream. Shimon Peres was born Shimon Perski on August 2nd, 1923, in the town of Vishneva, then in Poland, now a part of Belarus, close to Lithuania. I was an exceptionally large baby. I was a sensation, if you want. I almost killed my mother. And to this very day, I feel apologetic about it. But once I was born, the doctor checked me and he said: "This boy doesn't need anything, no vaccination." I didn't get a vaccination in my life, you know? Where I was born... It was a small shtetl, they called it. Small Jewish village. Something like a thousand souls, probably. All of them, without exception, Zionist. And for us, Israel was a dream. When a package of oranges came from Israel to Vishneva... it was the greatest event for all of us. They were beautifully packed in a sort of a silky Jaffa packing. And their smell was fantastic. Throughout his childhood in Vishneva, one of Shimon Peres' biggest influences was his maternal grandfather, Zvi Meltzer. A disciple of the legendary rabbinical figure, the Vilna Gaon, he studied and taught at the famed Volozhin Yeshiva. He was a rabbi. He was a rabbi. He knew by heart the Bible, the Talmud, all the others, but he was also playing the violin. He took me under his wings. I think I was the preferred grandchild he has had. He started to teach me, at the age, probably, of three or four, every day a page of the Talmud. He suggested to me to read even Russian literature. He told me to read The Brothers Karamazov of Dostoyevsky. There were weeks I couldn't fall asleep, you know? Imagine a child reading this terrible book. The second person who very much influenced his early life was his mother Sara. She was a librarian and she actually instilled into him the love for books, for literature. She read in three languages: She read in three languages: Russian, Yiddish and Hebrew. And she taught us the classics of Yiddish and the classics of Hebrew. And it was our bread and butter. Following in his grandfather's footsteps, young Shimon was devoutly religious, far more than his own father. You know, in the shtetl, there wasn't electricity. My father was well-to-do, so he brought a radio working on batteries. One Saturday, Shimon returned from the Sabbath prayers to find his father listening to the radio. I became outraged and I broke the radio. "How dare do you play on a Saturday?" If you want to understand Shimon's character, you have to go back to when he was four, five. He came once to his grandmother's home with another child. The boy was stocky, strong, much stronger than he was. And they played a game, one was going to throw the other on the ground. And the other was stronger, so he threw Shimon on the ground. Shimon got up and said in Yiddish: "An andere mal," "another time." So they do the second time. "An andere mal." Third time, fourth time. Finally, the grandmother said, "Shimon, that's enough. He's stronger than you." And Shimon said, "No, perhaps next time I'll win." And that's Shimon Peres from then until this very day. "Perhaps next time I'll win." Shimon Perski had a carefree childhood, swimming in the Olshansky River that ran behind his house with his friends and his younger brother Gershon or Gigi, as he became known... The forests surrounding Vishneva provided their father, Yitzhak, with a good living as a lumber merchant. But in the early 1930s, Polish authorities began to levy special taxes against Yitzhak Perski's lumber business because he was Jewish. It became almost impossible for him to make a living. In 1932, he decided he had no choice but to leave Vishneva for Palestine, Eretz Israel, where his brother and other family members had already moved. He would set up a new lumber business there and send for his wife Sara and his sons once he was making enough money. Not long after Yitzhak's departure, a member of the Jewish community was brutally murdered by an anti-Semitic gang in one of the nearby forests. And there was a picture of him in the papers. All of us were alarmed. So alarmed that they decided to leave for Palestine as soon as they could. A few months later, Shimon, Gigi, and Sara gathered at the train station outside of Vishneva. Among those who came to the station to say goodbye was his grandfather, Zvi Meltzer. He stood aside quietly. He stood aside quietly. When the locomotive arrived, he came close to me, embraced me, and told me: "My son, I have just one request from you. Remain Jewish." He embraced me, and that was the last time I saw him. Sara, Shimon, and Gigi arrived in Jaffa Harbor via Istanbul in British Mandatory Palestine in the summer of 1934. It was like arriving in a different planet, you know? It was like arriving in a different planet, you know? Nothing was alike in Jaffa and Vishneva. My father came with a boat, because there wasn't a port, with Arab sailors. But the first sensation was the sky. I never saw in my life a blue sky, blue, totally blue, and the sun, so warming, and the smell of the oranges, which is like perfume. People were not dressed as heavily as we were. They were lightly dressed. They were sunburned. They were strong. And for the first time, I came to a place where everything was written in Hebrew. Imagine coming from a place that you didn't see any Hebrew language to a place there is only Hebrew languages. It's like, you know, I was jumping from one world to another world. I couldn't believe it. I was reborn. And I was happy. That I don't have the words to describe it. My dream came true, and the dream was by far more beautiful, more fascinating, more optimistic, more than I ever had dreamed. Shimon enrolls in sixth grade at the Balfour School in Tel Aviv. He immediately stands out among other students, but for the wrong reasons. I knew Hebrew perfectly, but with the Ashkenazi accent. So a little bit at the beginning, the students were laughing at me. He wanted to be a sabra. He had an accent from which he didn't get rid until today, actually. And that was the one thing which he didn't like about my biography. He called me once and he said, "Who told you I have a Polish accent?" I said, "Shimon, nobody has to tell me that. I hear it." "You hear it! Who told you?" Then he met a friend whose father convinced him to go to the agricultural school in Ben Shemen. And then he saw his life, his future, in agriculture. He says once he wanted to be a farmer or a poet to the stars. "The most important service to the people of Israel is building the country by working the land," writes then 15-year-old Shimon Perski in an essay, "Why I Aspire to Study and Live in Ben Shemen." "My place is not in the city," he insists, "but in the village behind the plow, in the field." He also becomes a leader in one of the most popular Zionist youth movements in the country, HaNoar HaOved, "The Working Youth." Shimon's activism soon brings him to the attention of the chairman of the Jewish Agency, the leader of the Haganah, and perhaps  the most important figure in labor Zionism, David Ben-Gurion. So, one day I got a message from Ben-Gurion So, one day I got a message from Ben-Gurion that he would like to meet me. He was my hero, but I didn't dream to meet him. And he suggested that I should join him in his car from Tel Aviv to Haifa. I was very excited. It was a winterly day. I came to his place, and I came in the car. He fell asleep. There was no end to my disappointment, because there was no end to my expectations. Well, when we came near Haifa, all of a sudden he opened his eyes, looked at me. I'm not sure he knew who I am. He tried to think, "Who is that young boy here?" And all of a sudden he says: "You know, Trotsky was not a great leader." How did Trotsky enter the car at the last part of our voyage? I don't know. Ben-Gurion then proceeded to lecture Shimon on why Trotsky was not as effective a leader as Lenin because he was unable to make decisions. At the end of the sentence, he fell asleep, and that was the end of our trip. During the evening and night, the Arabs used to shoot at our village. We were surrounded all around by Arab villages. So during the night, I was on the watch. And that happened to be very near the home of Sonya. Sonya is the daughter of Ben Shemen's carpentry teacher, Yakov Gelman. He saw this girl coming out of the house with one of the teachers, and she had this gorgeous Greek profile, and she was with short pants, and he looked at her and he fell in love. And that was total. He was very much in love. October 1939. The Nazis invade Poland, and World War II begins. The British government issues a decree known as the White Paper, strictly limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine, making it impossible for Jews to flee Nazi-occupied Europe. David Ben-Gurion proclaims, "We will help the British as if there were no White Paper, and fight the White Paper as if there were no war." For this reason, thousands of Jews in Palestine soon enlist in the British Army to fight the Nazis. Among them, Shimon's father Yitzhak, who is soon captured by the Germans. For most of the war, the family has no idea if he's dead or alive. While some join the Haganah and its elite fighting division, the Palmach, to continue resisting the British mandatory authority, Shimon and many others choose a different path. He didn't want to enlist in the British Army. There was a slogan in Palestine at that time among the Jews. "Some to the arms and some to the land." And he preferred to build the kibbutz they were creating at the time. Kibbutz Alumot in Galilee. And that's the time when Sonya, his girlfriend, left him. She went to British Army. And he stayed and they separated. January 20th, 1942. A top secret meeting of high-ranking Nazis is taking place in a villa a few thousand miles away on picturesque Lake Wannsee, outside of Berlin. The topic of their discussion: the implementation of what will soon be called The Final Solution of the Jewish Question. In just a little over an hour and a half, these Nazi officials formalize the procedures that set up death camps such as Auschwitz, Treblinka, Sobibor, and Majdanek in the systematic murder of millions of European Jews. Four days later on January 24th, Shimon leads an expedition of the working youth, which he's organized, to the ancient fortress of Masada, the site of the famous First Century Jewish rebellion against the Romans. The British Mandatory Authority does not want Jews making pilgrimages to Masada and has banned Jews from traveling to this area. So the group is risking arrest. Their mission is to rebuild the paths going to the top of Masada, 1,500 feet above sea level, that had been destroyed in an earthquake. We saw some parts of the roads, We saw some parts of the roads, and I said: "Look, I think this is the way to the top." I started going. I made one curve. I found a connection to the other curve. When I came to the fourth curve, the curve disappeared. So I was hanging in the middle. And stones began to fall, and there was a danger to my life. His friends go into action. They climb to the top of Masada and make a human ladder, each person holding the legs of the other until the last is able to offer his legs to Shimon. And they started to carry me up to the top. Needless to say that for a day or two I couldn't walk. But there we were sitting and learning what happened in Masada. At the very end of their expedition, the group leaves a parchment scroll for future visitors to see. It proclaims, "Masada will never fall again." Eight months later, Shimon's beloved grandfather, Reb Zvi Meltzer, along with his grandmother, his uncle, and the remaining Jews of Vishneva, are rounded up and locked inside the shtetl synagogue, which is then set on fire. They're all burned alive. The Perski family will not learn of their fate until after the war's end. Shimon quickly becomes a leader at Alumot, the kibbutz he and his friends are building on a mountain overlooking the Galilee. He is elected general secretary and then treasurer. Shimon Perski also becomes a rising star in the youth movement of Mapai, the labor party faction under Ben-Gurion's leadership. He's given an old Triumph motorcycle so he can travel in the Jezreel Valley, recruiting new members, and spend two days a week in Tel Aviv conferring with party leaders. At the beginning of 1945, David Ben-Gurion gives him a special assignment: mapping and exploring the Negev Desert all the way down to Eilat, looking ahead to it becoming part of a future Jewish state. And when we were going, we saw in a very high tree an eagle. I saw it and immediately climbed the tree. Its Hebrew name is "Peres." It was there where I changed my name. Not long after the now Shimon Peres returns to Alumot, a special guest arrives at the kibbutz. Sonya, who has finished her British Army service. He remained in touch with her over the years, writing letters about Alumot and the life they were building in the Galilee. He never gave up hope that they might reunite and invited her to visit. The two fall deeply in love once again and resume their relationship. May the 1st... supposed  to be the last day of war, 1945. May the 1st... supposed  to be the last day of war, 1945. And Sonya and myself decided to get married. In the kibbutz, it was in the open air. There were hundreds of people coming over from the vicinity. Kibbutzim and moshavim. And we were happy. Their honeymoon consists of a few nights down the hill from Alumot, on the banks of the Jordan River in a tent set up as a gift by their fellow kibbutzniks. Missing from the wedding party is Shimon's father Yitzhak, who's been found alive in Europe at the war's end after escaping several German POW camps. He is stuck in England and would return as Sonya and Shimon's honeymoon was ending. In the summer of 1946, Shimon becomes a new father as Sonya gives birth to their daughter Zvia, who they nickname Zviki. A few months later, David Ben-Gurion summons Shimon to Haganah headquarters in Tel Aviv. The Jewish agency head wants a young man with his leadership skills on staff. And they promised it will be for a year's time. And they promised it will be for a year's time. And I had my... still, my Triumph. And I was Triumphing on Fridays back home. But this year lasted 20 years. May 14th, 1948. Great Britain ends its mandate in Palestine, six months after the United Nations passes a resolution declaring two states in the territory, one Jewish and one Arab. It also withdraws its troops. The Jews accept the resolution, the Arabs do not. Later that day, the Jewish People's Council assembles and declares the establishment of a Jewish state to be called Israel, with its capital in Jerusalem. In the days leading up to these events, David Ben-Gurion summons Shimon Peres to his office. Ben-Gurion said: Ben-Gurion said: "We are going to have a  war." And then he took out a piece of paper from his jacket, from his pocket, and he gave me a list, how many rifles we have, how many... He says: "With that, we shall lose the war. Go and do everything you can. Smuggle, steal, produce, buy. Everything is permitted." May 15th the following day, as Ben-Gurion has predicted, the Arab League declares war and attacks the new Jewish state. To our great surprise, To our great surprise, the United States, Great Britain and France decided to put an embargo on arms against the Middle East, but the Russians weren't part of it, so the Arabs continued to get arms, and we were alone. As the war rages, Shimon Peres becomes one of the key people responsible for ensuring that the Israel Defense Forces have the weaponry it needs. They went all over the world to buy weapons, to buy planes, even junk, but everything which could shoot or could be used as a weapon. They bought in South America, they bought in Africa, they bought all over in Europe. And they concentrated all these weapons in secret bases in France, in Corsica, Italy, and Greece. Despite the arms embargo, and Israel's numerical disadvantage fighting its Arab neighbors, the Jewish state emerges victorious by the time a truce is negotiated to end the war in 1949. Shimon has been promoted to the position of assistant secretary of defense for naval affairs. He's only 26 years old. Yet despite everything he has done to obtain arms to ensure Israel's existence, he finds himself being criticized by many of his peers. Unlike them, he has never become a soldier, although he did decline a commission as a colonel directly from the Army's chief of staff. I told him: "Look. Today, I'm a private. You'll make me a colonel, I have to salute this... And he will salute me, and I shall spend time on ceremonies, and I don't need it." Shimon was actually much more important than a soldier and even than a colonel. He worked with Ben-Gurion, Eshkol, and bought weapons, and planned the conquest of the Negev, and was the deputy chief of the Navy. Because he was doing such an important job, he didn't think it was important to wear a uniform. The fact is that if he had just worn a uniform during the war, his political career would have been ten-fold easier. In the months following the war's end, as Shimon Peres continues the search for weapons in the face of the international arms embargo, he finds himself very frustrated. He feels constrained by his lack of education. He has a high rank in the Defense Ministry, yet he doesn't even have a high school diploma. I came to Ben-Gurion and I said: "Look. I came to Ben-Gurion and I said: "Look. I am ashamed to tell you, but you should know. I don't know a single word in English." And Ben-Gurion said, "Very well. I'll send you to New York where we have our special mission of producing weapons for Israel. Most of them illegal, by the way. And you're going to be deputy director of this mission and later you'll take over." Sonya, Shimon, and Zviki move into an apartment on the corner of 95th Street and Riverside Drive on the Upper West side of New York City. While he takes classes at The New School for social research and a special course at Harvard University in advanced management, his main focus at the Israeli mission offices in Midtown Manhattan is trying to obtain arms for the Jewish state. One of Peres' biggest challenges is trying to bring in desperately needed aircraft in defiance of the embargo. Working with an aeronautics engineer named Al Schwimmer, he organizes a group of volunteer mechanics and pilots to bring these planes to Israel. They set up shop in Burbank, California, where they buy fighter planes completely unassembled as surplus parts to avoid raising suspicion with embargo authorities. Then the team reassembles the planes and flies them secretly to Israel. And Shimon said to Al Schwimmer, "I hope that one day we should not have to smuggle old planes from any country, but to build them alone, to build jets." And Ben-Gurion was visiting America at that time. And Ben-Gurion was visiting America at that time. We went to Burbank, where the place was, and he saw small buildings, totally unimpressive, preparing the planes. He says: "Impossible." So, I told him: "Look, if it's possible in Burbank, it's possible in Israel." And he brought Al Schwimmer to Israel and they build jets. The Israeli Aircraft Industry is what Shimon built together with this guy. 1952. Prime Minister Ben-Gurion calls Shimon Peres back to Israel. The director of the Defense Ministry has just resigned and he wants Shimon to take his place. Prime Minister Ben-Gurion also chooses Moshe Dayan as the IDF's new chief of staff. Peres is delighted. He has looked up to Dayan since he was a teenager. During this same period, the Peres family grows by one more as Yonatan, or Yoni, is born. But very quickly, Sonya and Shimon are facing a tremendous challenge when Yoni contracts polio. It is an especially difficult time for Sonya, who's not only coping with her son's illness but very much missing the life she gave up on kibbutz Alumot. She was not very happy about his career. Not at all. But as long as he was in security, in the Defense establishment, or working for Ben-Gurion, that was the holy sacrosanct, that was important for the country. November 1952. World War II hero Dwight Eisenhower is elected president of the United States in a landslide. He appoints John Foster Dulles as his secretary of state. They strengthen the embargo policy against Israel and focus on closer ties with the Jewish state's oil-rich Arab neighbors. Shimon Peres' job to find arms becomes that much more difficult. At the same time, the Soviet Union has become openly anti-Jewish and anti-Israel, increasing the quantities of sophisticated arms that's been sent into the Arab world. Its favorite client state is Egypt, led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had recently taken power during a military coup overthrowing King Farouk. His main passion is to destroy the Jewish state. He creates units of Palestinian terrorists called Fedayeen, which infiltrate Israel, attacking both civilian and military targets. Nasser is also fueling the flames of Arab nationalists in the French colony of Algeria. By 1954, with his help, France and Algeria are headed for an all-out war. At this moment, Shimon Peres recognizes an opportunity for Israel's Defense needs that no one else is seeing. The fact that France and the Jewish state are fighting a common foe. I went to Ben-Gurion. I went to Ben-Gurion. I said: "I don't know a word in French. I don't know anybody in France. Let me try my hand." Labor Minister Golda Meir, Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett, and Israel's UN Ambassador Abba Eban are convinced that Peres was wasting his time. Shimon went to France in spite of all his colleagues, all the cabinet ministers just laughed at him. In France, the governments were very weak. Governments were falling every couple of weeks. He found out that no matter what the government was, personal relationships were very, very important. So he started working very, very... I would say methodically, meeting members of parliament, journalists, political figures, generals, Jewish leaders. Early on, Peres befriends France's Interior Minister, a conservative named Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury, who's one of the leaders of the movement to fight Nasser as a means of defeating the Algerian nationalists. Bourgès then negotiates with Shimon Peres, the first of several agreements for the purchase of advanced French fighter jets, cargo planes, light tanks, radar equipment, and cannons. But Shimon Peres does not restrict his contacts to the conservatives. Another political leader he cultivates is on the other end of the political spectrum, Guy Mollet, the secretary general of France's Socialist Party. The two become fast friends. As their relationship is developing, Mollet calls Peres, explaining he has a dilemma. Guy Mollet says: Guy Mollet says: "Did you hear that I'm an anti-Semite? There was a fight in the party. The other candidate was Jewish, so they say I'm anti-Semitic. Look, the French press is totally against me. You know, many of them are Jewish people. Please help me." I said: "Guy, I don't know anybody among the papers. I'm a stranger in town." He says: "Try." Next week at the greatest magazine of France, Guy Mollet appeared on the front with a very complimentary portrait. And he decided that I did it. He called me up. He says: "Thank you." I said: "Guy, I don't know anything about it." Then what happened? Elections arrived. And who became the prime minister? Guy Mollet. Joining Mollet's new government as defense minister is Shimon's other good friend Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury. This coalition was marked very strongly by the will to end the Algerian war, to beat the Algerians, and Guy Mollet started sending his views on this work. That was the breakthrough. July 1956. Nasser seizes the Suez Canal, jointly built and owned by France and Great Britain. He also closes the Straits of Tiran, one of Israel's most important maritime passageways to the world. French Defense Minister Bourgès-Maunoury approaches Shimon Peres to discuss how they can take back the canal and the Straits of Tiran. Soon, Great Britain becomes involved in the talks, as does Israeli Army Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan, who comes up with a plan that France, England, and Prime Minister Ben-Gurion all support. Israeli troops will invade the Sinai peninsula, provoking the Egyptians into battle. This will give the French and the British a pretext to intervene, stop the fighting, and in the process, take back the canal and the Straits of Tiran. October 29th, 1956. The campaign that becomes known as the Sinai War begins. It lasted a hundred hours. It lasted a hundred hours. That's all. The Egyptians started to surrender in masses, thousands and thousands of them. The victory was brilliant, brilliant. We achieved all the things. And from 1956 up to 1967... no single act of terror. The Straits of Tiran were open. It gave us a prestige we never enjoyed before. The dangers to Israel's security have not yet passed. We must continue the effort of preparing the country to new possibilities. The Arabs are still holding sophisticated technology of modern weaponry. And we need to furnish the Israeli military with the tools of tomorrow. Shimon Peres knows that Israel has much to gain by joining with France and England in the Sinai campaign, but, at the same time, he's also very cognizant of the great risk the Jewish state is taking. He said, "We're going to be hated, ostracized, and attacked by the entire Arab world. We need deterrent power." And they immediately understood what he's talking about. He had already made some hints before that he wants to build a nuclear reactor. The French are pioneers in nuclear weapons development. They are, along with the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union, one of the world's four nuclear powers at the time. But they are also spearheading efforts to harness nuclear energy for peaceful uses, already supplying France with a significant amount of its electricity through nuclear power plants they're building throughout the country. Both Ben-Gurion and myself, Both Ben-Gurion and myself, we were fascinated by it. We knew that we are condemned to have a small piece of land, that we are condemned to have many enemies. We have nothing of value, neither land, nor water, nor oil, and here, in our eyes of imagination, we thought maybe we found a solution to it. We can be small in land, but great in knowledge. While French Defense Minister Bourgès-Maunoury and Foreign Minister Christian Pineau know very well what Shimon is asking for, there's a huge obstacle in the way of granting him his request. European atomic energy regulations will not allow France to sell a non-European country uranium. So I went to them and I said: "You know what? Don't sell us uranium. Rent us uranium for a while, and whenever you want, we shall send it back." Pineau said, "Yeah,that's a good idea. I can live with that." And that was the very moment when the nuclear reactor, nuclear power of Israel was born. The idea may have been born, but Shimon Peres now had to find a way to finance it. He needs the equivalent today of a half a billion dollars. A sum that's almost unimaginable in Israel at the time. Prime Minister Ben-Gurion tells him to see Defense Minister Levi Eshkol. I went to Eshkol. He called me "yunger" man,  young man. "Tell me what you want to do." I spread before him the map, the plan, the budget. Then he says: "Yunger man, so nice of you. Take my word: You will never see a penny from me. Forget it." He had nobody supporting him. Nobody. The army said that's crazy. The head of the Mossad was against him 'cause he was afraid of the Russians. Yitzhak Rabin said, "With the money I can create two new armored divisions." Golda Meir was virulently opposed. Well, I went to tell Ben-Gurion. And he says: "What are we going to do?" So, I suggested to him, "You know what? Let's try to collect the money outside of the government." Peres and Ben-Gurion met secretly with quite a few Jewish millionaires throughout the world. In Israel, in the States, and other places, and they were warned: "If you help us and contribute, there will be no plaques with your name on the walls of the nuclear reactor. That's something we should do for the future of the Jewish people and Israel, but nobody will say thank you. It's going to be a secret." And these people agreed and did it. It is decided to build the reactor in Dimona near Beersheba, an undeveloped area of the Negev Desert. Far away from population centers and water sources in case of an emergency. But towards the end of 1957, Israel's nuclear program is in danger of being completely shut down. Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury has been elected France's prime minister and final approval from his government is needed to allow the transfer of French uranium to Israel. Foreign Minister Pineau is now objecting to the deal, concerned that Israel will use the reactor for defense purposes. Peres rushes to France and not only demonstrates that Israel is not developing a nuclear bomb, he goes a step further, promising to get France's approval before any weaponizing can take place at Dimona. And Pineau says to him: "You convinced me. I agree." And he writes a letter to the prime minister. Pineau gives the letter to Shimon, outlining that he no longer objects to Israel's reactor and has been assured of its peaceful purposes. But now time is of the essence in getting the letter to Prime Minister Bourgès. At that very moment, he's in Parliament, debating about the future of his government, which is danger of being brought down by a vote of no confidence. Peres runs to the Parliament building. Shimon is waiting outside. It's 4:00 p.m. And the one of the assistants of Bourgès-Manoury comes to Shimon, brings him a glass of whiskey. "The Prime Minister will be here in half an hour now." So Shimon takes it. Five p.m., another glass of whiskey. Six p.m., 8:00 p.m., 9:00 p.m. Shimon realizes there is no chance for him to see Bourgès-Maunoury that night, and a couple of hours later, a vote in the Parliament, the government falls. Bourgès-Maunoury is not a prime minister anymore. Ben-Gurion hears that on the BBC and he writes in his diary: "Such a pity that Shimon went for nothing to Paris." The following day, Peres meets with Bourgès-Maunoury and says: "Why don't we backdate the agreement? As if it was signed between you and me yesterday when you were still prime minister." And Bourgès said: "Why not?" And they faked the document. I said: "Shimon, how could you do that?" Oh, he said: "Come on, Michael." He said: "Between friends, 24 hours. What's the big deal?" We never take a formal decision to make a bomb. But I thought for sure that even if we shall not have a bomb, the image of deterrent was born... and will serve the purpose. And it started to have an effect upon the Arabs. In 1958, a new member joins the Peres household. A brother to Zviki and Yoni, who Sonya and Shimon name Nehemia, or Chemi, as he is soon to be called by the family. During this same period of time, Peres quietly accomplishes another victory for Israel's defense establishment. He negotiates a top secret deal with West Germany to supply sophisticated weapon systems at no cost, as part of its ongoing war reparations program for the Jewish state. That is the kind of side result, not that pleasant. Golda Meir, she was the minister of foreign affairs, she cried: "Why does he do that to me?" Because she felt that he was taking her job. But that was Shimon. He was creative. He was thinking all the time. "Who can help?" Golda did not very much understand Europe, and Shimon did. Shimon did. In the summer of 1963, 77-year-old David Ben-Gurion resigns as prime minister and retires to his kibbutz, Sde-Boker. Levi Eshkol takes his place. Shimon is asked to stay on in his role as deputy defense minister. May 1967. Nasser shocks the world by sending a massive number of armored divisions into the Sinai, and orders UN peacekeeping forces to leave. He also closes the Straits of Tiran. For some eleven years, Israel's southern border has been quiet. But it is becoming increasingly apparent that war is on the horizon. Tensions increase after a national radio address by Prime Minister Eshkol, in which he comes off as weak and indecisive. A group in the Knesset led by opposition leader Menachem Begin demands that Eshkol resign so that a stronger war leader can step in as prime minister. But Eshkol refuses to heed their call. So Shimon Peres and others push him to relinquish his other position as defense minister in favor of former Army Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan. Realizing he's fighting a losing battle, Eshkol reluctantly gives in. Peres is asked to deliver the news to Ben-Gurion, who's still insisting that Eshkol resign as prime minister. I came in. I came in. I told Ben-Gurion the whole story. Ben-Gurion became angry and he says: "I thought you are my friend. You are not. I thought you are a great statesman. You are not. I thought I can rely upon you. I can't." But what can I tell you? The nature of the crisis I went through and the nerves. And it looks like I lost everything. At this point, Shimon feels he has no choice but to stand up to Ben-Gurion. He tells his mentor that continuing to criticize Eshkol is not in Israel's best interest at such a crucial time. The old man is taken aback by Shimon's challenge, but then he thinks for a few moments. "You know what?" he replies. "You're right." That evening, Ben-Gurion calls a meeting of his supporters and addresses them. And he says: "I knew many people that never think of themselves." And he came, embraced me, and then he says: "But there is nobody like Shimon." June 5th,1967. The Six-Day War breaks out. When the fighting is over, the West Bank of the Jordan River, the Golan Heights, the Sinai, the Gaza Strip, as well as the old city of Jerusalem, are all in Israel's hands. After the sudden death in 1969 of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, who forged a new relationship with the United States as Israel's strategic partner and arms supplier, Golda Meir is chosen as Israel's fourth prime minister. She leads the newly formed Labor Party to victory in national elections later that year. Despite a long, rancorous relationship with Shimon Peres, Prime Minister Meir selects him to be a minister without portfolio in her new cabinet. It is not out of a newfound sense of appreciation for him. Rather, Moshe Dayan, Israel's most popular political figure, makes it clear that if he's going to remain as minister of defense, he wants Peres in the cabinet as well. But "minister without portfolio" is a misnomer for Shimon Peres. Moshe Dayan put him in charge of developing the West Bank in Gaza. And then Golda, impressed with what he accomplishes, gives him the ministries of absorption, transportation, and the post office. Soon, Peres is at work building an international university, new housing, and settling immigrants in Israel's growing capital city of Jerusalem. He pioneers the country's freeway system and modernizes its aging train service. And while he oversees the construction of new Jewish settlements in the territories, he also initiates projects in the West Bank, in Gaza, to improve living conditions in the refugee camps, and builds industrial parks to provide work for the Palestinians. Summer 1973. Moshe Dayan and the IDF's high command begin receiving intelligence reports about Egyptian and Syrian troop movements on its borders, but the defense minister and the generals do not believe an attack is imminent. It's a fatal miscalculation. On Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year, a coalition of Arab armies led by Egypt and Syria take Israel by surprise, assaulting it from all sides. Despite heavy early losses by the Yom Kippur War's end some three weeks later, Israel has completely turned the situation around. The Egyptian Third Army is surrounded. The IDF has moved deep into Egypt and Syria, approaching both Cairo and Damascus. President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger insist that Israel halt its advance and a ceasefire is called. But unlike 1967, when people were celebrating Israel's victories in the streets, this time the mood of the country is glum. Almost everyone knows a family whose son has been killed or injured. The national psyche is damaged, and Israelis are angry at their leaders. I think Dayan was a great soldier. I think Dayan was a great soldier. He made a terrible mistake. We went together to visit the tombs of the soldiers. It was one of my worst days in life. The families of the fallen soldiers spit at him. They called him "Traitor! Shame on you." A few weeks later, on December 1, 1973, David Ben-Gurion dies at the age of 87. Shimon Peres is summoned to the hospital when he's dying. I saw this lion... lying like a dead person. Look, for me you can imagine what it meant. All my life I admired him. I thought the man is innocent. He's not cynical. He can shout. He can fight. Never bluff, never lie. My relations with him were lonely. I never participated in big parties, in big occasions. Just when I have had something, I came to him. He would listen to me carefully, say yes or say no, usually yes. And I would go and do it. He trusted me. On April 10, 1974, after months of protest  by thousands of Israelis over who was to blame for the surprise attack on Yom Kippur, Prime Minister Meir makes the following statement: "I am resigning. I cannot carry the burden anymore. I've reached the end of the road." An unexpected candidate emerges to replace Mrs. Meir. Former IDF Chief of Staff and Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Yitzhak Rabin. Having not served in Golda's cabinet, he's considered free of the taint of the Yom Kippur War debacle. She and others in the Labor Party establishment decide to support his candidacy. But then Shimon Peres shocks everyone when he makes the surprise announcement that he too is going to run for the premiership. Yitzhak Rabin, who's never forgiven Shimon for not wearing an Army uniform in 1948, is furious and questions his right to run. The Labor Party election takes place less than two weeks after Golda's resignation. Shimon is expected to get no more than 30 percent of the vote, but then he astonishes everyone and wins almost 47 percent, losing to Rabin by only 44 ballots. As the number two in the party, Peres insists upon being given the Defense Ministry, something which Rabin resists. But when it's made clear to him that his chances of forming a ruling coalition and becoming prime minister depend on Shimon being given his cabinet position, he reluctantly gives in. Shimon Peres, who's been one of the key people responsible for building Israel's security establishment, is finally at its helm. It was a Sunday, It was a Sunday, and I got a note that a French plane was hijacked and among the passengers are over a hundred Jewish people. The hijackers, two Palestinians and two Germans, force the pilots to fly to Entebbe Airport in Uganda. The plane is greeted by the country's leader, Idi Amin, who is more than happy to allow it to land at Entebbe and do the terrorists' bidding. He stood before us with his Army uniform. He had the Israeli paratrooper wings and he said to us in English: "Maybe you know me. I am Field Marshal Doctor Idi Amin Dada, the president of the Republic of Uganda." Amin is wearing those wings because he had done military training in Israel in the 1960s, but he's turned against the Jewish state and is now allied with the Palestinian cause. The hijackers, the terrorists-- The hijackers, the terrorists-- Two of them were Germans-- went through all the passengers, asked them if they are Jewish or not. Non-Jewish? Go out. Jewish? Stay. You know, for me, it was a terrible shock. It was a small holocaust. They are going to decide whom to kill and whom not. And I thought: "We have to do whatever we can." First the hijackers release a list of terrorists being held in Kenya, Germany, France and Israel, demanding that they be released. Then they order that the prisoners be freed within 36 hours, otherwise they'll start executing the hostages. In Jerusalem, the Rabin government begins weighing its options. The prime minister thought since we don't have any other option and the families of the persons that were hijacked started to call upon him to save their lives, so he tended to accept the conditions. I came to him and said: "Yitzhak, it's a mistake." The prime minister angrily challenges Peres, asking if he has a better plan. Shimon and the IDF Chief of Staff Motta Gur, have been looking at Israel's military options almost since the crisis began, but their initial ideas have been quickly rejected by Rabin as not feasible. In the meantime, a group of young officers organized themselves, said they had an idea of their own. I saw the boys. Unbelievable. Courageous. Wise. Experienced. And they say it's possible. I went to the prime minister. I said: "I would like to try to work with this group of people and see if we can find a solution." But Rabin is still skeptical. Shimon Peres, Motta Gur, and their special team go into high gear to finalize a military plan that will meet with Prime Minister Rabin's approval. Twenty-four hours later, a viable course of action is coming together. That Sunday, July 4, the IDF will fly in an elite force of commandos to Uganda, as Idi Amin will be out of the country at a conference of African states. Hercules troop carriers will fly from Israel and land in Entebbe as if Idi Amin is returning home from the conference he's been attending. A black Mercedes limousine exactly like Amin's will then drive out of one of the Hercules with an Israeli soldier inside disguised to look like the dictator, surrounded by elite Israeli commandos, also made up to look like Ugandan soldiers. The commandos will then take the hijackers by surprise, overpower them, and rescue the hostages, getting them on the Hercules and spiriting them back to Israel. On Saturday morning, July 3, Chief of Staff Gur phones Peres to report that an airborne run-through with the Hercules planes has succeeded. That impressed Rabin. That impressed Rabin. And we decided we do it. Peres and Gur make their way to the airfield in Tel Aviv, where the planes and soldiers are getting ready for the mission. The lead commando, 30-year-old Yonatan Netanyahu, approaches Peres and shakes his hand, stating that the plan is 100 percent. Shimon embraces him. And then he, along with the rest of the commandos, board the planes and leave on their mission. It was one week almost to the minute after they'd taken off on their ill-fated flight to Paris, that the crew and remaining passengers landed back on Israeli soil. It was, coincidentally, at the exact hour at which the hijackers' ultimatum to the Israeli government was due to run out, and the hostages had been warned by their captors that they would die. What made you think that Israel could pull off an operation like this? The alternative. People attribute much to luck. People attribute much to luck. Luck is important. But what we call luck is actually courage. You have to take risks, and you cannot say, "The risk I'm taking is to have luck." You have to prepare very carefully that you will not depend  upon the luck. While the Hercules are in the air and the commandos are on the ground in Entebbie, the entire operation unfolds in complete radio silence. And on Saturday night, And on Saturday night, the silence was broken. The Chief of Staff Motta, called me up and said: "We lost one of our fighters." And that was Yoni Netanyahu. I almost cried. But what can I do? The father of Yoni came to me and he said: "I have one request. I want that you will eulogize him." Thanks to the few, many have been saved. Thanks to the few, many have been saved. And thanks to the one fallen, new stature has been revived. And about him, and them, it can be said in the words of King David: "Swifter than eagles, stronger than lions, Yonatan on the altar has fallen." I am sorry for you, my brother Yonatan. You were to me very pleasant. Your love was wonderful. I first met Shimon at my brother's funeral, at my brother's grave, when he delivered this inspiring eulogy. He spoke about him in such... moving terms and also in historical terms that... it just mesmerized me and my family. And that created a bond that lasted throughout the rest of Shimon's life and which I never forgot. Never. All the credit for the Entebbe operation goes to Shimon, not anybody else. And that were the words of the Chief of Staff of the Army Motta Gur. The night of the raid, said: "All the credit must go to somebody, to one man who pushed up and pushed down, and did not rest, and did not stop until he achieved this operation, and this is the Minister of Defense, and we owe him all the credit for that." April 1977. Prime Minister Rabin shocks the nation, resigning after the news of a financial scandal involving an illegal foreign bank account belonging to his wife Leah. Shimon Peres becomes acting prime minister and is selected as the Labor Party's candidate for the election scheduled five weeks later. Running against him is the perennial leader of the opposition, Likud Party head, Menachem Begin, who many initially give little chance of defeating Peres. However, a series of other corruption scandals within the Labor Party also begin dominating the news. Shimon soon finds himself fighting an uphill battle. Well... it seems... No less than an upheaval. Well... it seems... No less than an upheaval. Begin outpolls Peres by almost nine percent of the electorate, ending three decades of Labor Party rule in the Knesset, and the Prime Minister's Office. It is a humiliating defeat for Shimon. Shimon Peres buries his disappointment over losing the Prime Minister's Office to Menachem Begin by becoming a vociferous leader of the opposition in the Knesset. This is especially the case during the 1982 Lebanon War, which becomes one of the most controversial in Israel's history. We were attacked from Lebanon We were attacked from Lebanon by the PLO and Hezbollah. Most of the attacks were done by mortars at the range of 40 kilometers. Begin told me that we will not go further than 40 kilometers, the range of the mortars. It won't take more than four days. I told him: "Look, if it's four days, 40 kilometers, and if the purpose is to bring an end to the attacks upon us, I'm for it." Peres travels to the battle zone as a show of support for the troops and the aims of the mission. He visits his son Chemi, a helicopter pilot flying in some  of the heaviest battles of the war in Damour, one of the main terrorist bases in Lebanon. But as Operation Peace for Galilee expands to bombing Beirut, Peres' views begin to change. He becomes one of its most vocal opponents, even clashing with Yitzhak Rabin, who supported the siege against the PLO in Beirut. Public opinion also begins turning against the war after Israel is blamed for a Christian militias' massacre at two Palestinian refugee camps outside of Beirut. This leads to an Israeli government inquiry and the resignation of Ariel Sharon as defense minister. Emotionally and physically drained by what has become a disaster in Lebanon, and then the death of his wife Aliza, Menachem Begin resigns as prime minister in September of 1983. His successor is the new head of the Likud, Yitzhak Shamir. The former leader of the Stern Gang, one of the most extreme pre-Israel underground movements, he also opposed the Camp David Accords from the time of Anwar Sadat's historic visit to Jerusalem in 1977. Known for being a man of few words, Shamir is not a skilled politician like his predecessor, and he soon finds himself overwhelmed by the myriad of problems Israel is facing: the continuing war in Lebanon, the deepening tensions with the Palestinians, and an out-of-control inflation rate that's threatening to destroy the economy. July 1984. New elections are called, Labor emerges the victor. I got 44 mandates. I got 44 mandates. The Likud, headed by Shamir, had 41. I had a majority. But I didn't have a majority to build a government without him. So we suggested: "Let's have a government based on rotation." For the first 25 months of this national unity government, Shimon Peres will serve as prime minister, and Yitzhak Shamir will be deputy prime minister and foreign minister. The subsequent 25 months, the positions will be reversed. All the best. Go get some rest. It's time, after all. All the best. Go get some rest. It's time, after all. Well, I have two years for that. Shimon Peres is formally sworn in as prime minister on September 13, 1984. After fulfilling his first campaign promise, to withdraw Israel's troops from Lebanon, Prime Minister Peres takes on Israel's disastrous economy. The country's inflation rate is one of the highest in the world with some economists warning Peres that it could surpass 1,000 percent. Investors are fleeing the country's industries. Prices in Israeli stores are being raised every day. I'd like to see how you're able to provide for a family of four or six people! Peres brings together a task force of scholars and economists which devises a plan that involves severe cutbacks from every sector of society. I called in a Cabinet session I called in a Cabinet session that lasted for 36 hours. And I cut from everybody. And I cut 500 million dollars from Defense. That was the largest cut in the history of Israel. Then I cut from Education. The minister of Education was my best friend. It was the end of the friendship. All ministers agreed to the cuts of other ministries. None of them agreed to cut his own ministry. But I said: "Gentlemen, either you take it or I leave you." In 36 hours, whoever closed his eyes for a moment, I cut his budget. I was criticized from one end to the other end. But to my great surprise, the tougher I was, the more insistent I became, I noticed there is a change in the public opinion. Day to day, my polls went up, contrary to all of the predictions. In a matter of six weeks, the inflation started to go down. Israel's inflation rate drops from almost 500% a year to 16%. Prime Minister Peres' approval rating surpasses 70%, the highest ever recorded. He's due to swap roles in October 1986 with Deputy Prime Minister Shamir. And there were some people, including yours truly, would try to influence him to break the rotation, to go for new elections. He was so popular. It was 80% popularity. Stop it! Go to elections! I told them: "Gentlemen, I gave my word. I'm not going to change." I knew, from experience and otherwise, if you don't keep your promises, you will never be a leader. On October 20, 1986, Yitzhak Shamir is sworn in as prime minister. Shimon Peres becomes deputy prime minister and foreign minister, and he quickly focuses on a new goal, a peace treaty with Jordan, and with King Hussein's assistance, a solution to the ongoing conflict with the Palestinians. What was the idea? What was the idea? That we shall have three entities: The Jordanian Kingdom, the State of Israel, and the West Bank that was under the Jordanian rule. The West Bank will be not really completely independent, The Jordanian king and our government will manage together the West Bank. Whoever lives in all those places, if he's Israeli, he will vote for the Israeli Parliament. If he's a Jordanian, he'll vote for the Jordanian Kingdom. Everybody can move to wherever he wants. There wouldn't be any problem of settlements, there wouldn't be any problem about holy places, because it's open. In a historic speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Shimon Peres offers to enter into direct negotiations with the Hashemite Kingdom. The speech is received positively and initiates a secret dialogue between King Hussein and Peres, supported by the United States. April 1987. The king and Shimon Peres are on their way to a clandestine meeting in London. Prime Minister Shamir refuses to take the meeting seriously. "Why is Shimon doing this?" he remarks. "Nothing will come of it." The meeting is facilitated by a prominent member of London's Jewish community, Victor Mishcon, who is friendly with King Hussein because their children are going to school together. We met on a Saturday morning We met on a Saturday morning at the home of Mishcon. Lady Mishcon sent all the staff out. She prepared herself the lunch, the dinner, the breakfast, without any servants. The talks go on throughout the day. After Mrs. Mishcon prepares dinner for the group, the king and Peres take an unusual break from the talks. The king said: "Mrs. Mishcon is working so hard. Let's the two of us go and wash the dishes," to which I agreed quickly. After another two hours of discussion, the king and Shimon are in full agreement on the major points of what will soon be called The London Agreement. Peres immediately returns to Israel so he can meet with Prime Minister Shamir and apprise him of the historic agreement. When we met on Sunday, When we met on Sunday, I read the agreement in the ears of Shamir. Quiet. He didn't answer. But the next day, without my knowledge, he sent one of his ministers to George Shultz, the secretary of state of the United States, and said that he's against the agreement. Shultz was under the impression that this was an agreement so comfortable for Israel, the best we could have. All of a sudden he says: "Well, I can't split the Israeli government." And I lost. King Hussein is so angry about the collapse of the London Agreement that he tells the Israelis: "If you want to make peace, go to the Palestinians. I'm washing my hands of this." It was the best agreement Israel has had. Even the Likud party members said that the London Agreement was the best we ever had, we ever could have. If this London Agreement had been carried out, no Hamas, no Fatah, no Palestinian Authority. We could have a different world. The final 18 months of the National Unity government are painful for Shimon. He and Shamir are constantly at odds. Eventually the two men stop speaking. And he, by definition, And he, by definition, was a very intransigent gentleman. He looked upon us-- We were younger than him-- as people in a hurry. "You, the people with impatience, always in a hurry." November 1988. Yitzhak Shamir becomes prime minister in a new National Unity government. Peres is given a minor Cabinet position. By 1990, he is out of the government after a failed attempt to bring a no-confidence motion against Shamir. As the Palestinian uprising, which became known as the Intifada, rages throughout the West Bank, Peres is sitting as an opposition back-bencher in the Knesset. He places the blame for the violence on Yitzhak Shamir's rejection of the London Agreement in 1987. February 1992. The bitter rivalry between Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres once again erupts. Rabin challenges Peres for the leadership of the Labor Party. He ends up garnering almost 41% of the vote to Shimon's 35%. That June, Yitzhak Rabin, who'd resigned in disgrace as prime minister in 1977, wins overwhelmingly in his return to the office. I will be leading. I will be leading. I will determine who will be ministers. Rabin and his supporters have very little interest in giving Shimon any sort of prominent role in the government. However, since Peres has won more than a third of the Labor vote, Party leaders pressure Rabin into giving him his former post as foreign minister, but the prime minister curtails or diminishes many of his responsibilities. At the beginning, Shimon Peres was nothing in the Cabinet. They tried to stop him. To besiege him from all sides. Another one of the entourage of Rabin said: "He's going to be minister for cocktails." But Peres, once the little boy who kept getting back up after being knocked down, saying: "Perhaps next time I shall win," remains determined. Quietly, he starts down a path that will alter Israel's relationship with the Palestinians and shake up Middle East politics forever. Since the failure of the London Agreement, Shimon has never given up on the dream of peaceful co-existence with the Palestinians. US-sponsored talks between Israel and Palestinian groups, which excluded the PLO, had fallen apart. Seeing that no one in the Palestinian world is willing to make a move without first getting permission from Yasser Arafat, Peres concludes that Israel has no choice but to negotiate directly with the PLO if it's going to make peace. All of my friends in the government said: "Not Arafat. He is a terrorist." And I said: "You have somebody better? You have somebody else?" Members of Peres' inner circle reach out to Abu Ala, the PLO's finance minister, a close associate of Yasser Arafat and a moderate. With the help of a Norwegian diplomat friendly to both sides, they begin a series of secret peace talks in Oslo, Norway. So, I went to Rabin and I told him, "Look, here is a man So, I went to Rabin and I told him, "Look, here is a man who can make decisions. I want to continue." While he is skeptical about the chances of the talks succeeding, Rabin allows them to continue. He also permits Peres to send Uri Savir, the director general of the Foreign Ministry, to join the talks. Abu Ala and Uri Savir begin to make progress on a declaration of principles that calls for Israel and the PLO to mutually recognize one another. Give the PLO control of Gaza and Jericho and set benchmarks for the final status of East Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees, but there's a big obstacle complicating their work. Arafat is not a simple personality, so to speak. Arafat is not a simple personality, so to speak. Without him, we couldn't start, but with him, it was almost impossible to conclude. Whenever Abu Ala informed him that they achieved everything, Arafat said: "No, no, no." He wanted to show that he is the man that decides. In mid-August, at a celebration marking his 70th birthday, Shimon reveals to a small circle of friends what has been taking place in Oslo. He explains to the surprised group, "I've devoted most of my life to Defense. What is left for me now, after we've built a strong Israel, is to bring peace to our young generation." The moment the nuclear reactor was built and Israel became strong, and actually invincible because of that, we felt that we can today become much more generous toward our neighbors, find a way to make peace with them. Shimon is about to start a long-planned diplomatic tour of Scandinavia. He decides to use this opportunity to personally try concluding the negotiations, which he worries are becoming hopelessly delayed by petty arguments and trivial details. We reached Oslo, and we called the Norwegian foreign minister to spend the night with us, and we used that night actually negotiating through the telephone with the mediation of the Norwegians, on the other side was Tunis, in order to overcome the very last disagreements. Some of them were overwhelmed. Some of them were overwhelmed. Some of them were angry. I could hear it on the phone. I could hear the voice of Yasser Arafat. I mean, they were so excited. Peres immediately phones Prime Minister Rabin and informs him that an agreement has been reached on the declaration of principles. At 2:30 that morning, the two delegations arrive at the royal guesthouse in Oslo, greeted by the Norwegian foreign minister and Shimon Peres. It is the first time that Shimon and Abu Ala are meeting in person. He asked to see me privately, He asked to see me privately, and he burst in tears. He said: "You must understand we are the only people that don't have anything. For us, this is the first time to be recognized. And not by Arabs but by Jews." Peres then flies to the United States to meet with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher to outline what has been accomplished in Oslo. After President Bill Clinton is briefed, it is decided that a signing ceremony will take place in Washington, DC. But first, Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres have to sell the Cabinet on approving  the agreement. Despite being stunned by what they are hearing about Oslo for the first time, all the ministers, except for one, vote to approve the accords. Rabin went all the way to stand behind and support Shimon in this move. What these two men finally found out was that even though they would fight between them, the moment there was a question of national importance, these two guys will sit together and all of a sudden, a kind of metamorphosis. They would work together, understand each other, help each other. There was a, I would say, a cooperation, a harmony between them, which was unbelievable. The focus is now on the September 13th signing ceremony on the White House lawn. However, behind the scenes, leading up to the event, drama is once again unfolding. Rabin refused to shake the hand of Arafat, Rabin refused to shake the hand of Arafat, "I don't want to shake his hand. He's a terrorist." Then Clinton intervened. He said: "How can you come and not shake the hand of your partner?" And then he took the two of them, almost forced them, and Rabin shook the hand of Arafat. Then he called me and he said: "Now it's your turn." The thing that struck me was, when we got to the end, it was clear to me that Rabin trusted Peres and what he was trying to do at Oslo. Peres was just so comfortable and confident... that he tended to calm things down, tended to make people believe that, yes, there are all these unanswered questions and yes, we used to fight, and yes, we used to argue, but we have decided for peace. Now we have to decide the details. It seems so simple now. It wasn't. I mean, they both knew that the extreme opponents of this agreement would try to, at a minimum, hurt them politically and maybe more. Almost immediately after returning home from Washington, Peres suggested to Prime Minister Rabin that the time is now ripe to forge a treaty with King Hussein. He told Rabin: "We have to storm into Jordan... in a peaceful way." And we spent a day and a half in Amman secretly. We crossed the river disguised. Peres with a wig and a mustache. After a day and a half of discussions with the king, his brother Crown Prince Hassan, and the Prime Minister Majali, we've reached four or five pages of detailed agreement, which is the basis of the later on peace agreement with Israel and Jordan, and the King and Peres initialed this document. The king asks that the agreement be kept completely secret for the time being. Elections are upcoming in Jordan, and the popularity of the Muslim Brotherhood is on the rise. Hussein has concerns that news of the treaty might sway the outcome. But when Shimon is seen crossing back into Israel, no longer wearing his disguise, the speculation starts about why he was in Jordan. Then he makes a careless remark in front of journalists before a radio interview. They put two and two together and report that he and the king have met. Hussein is furious and refuses to meet with Peres any longer. Yitzhak Rabin is more than happy to exclude his foreign minister from the final talks. Taking center stage and finishing the work Shimon Peres initiated as the treaty is formally signed in July 1994. There was a time when war was fought for lack of choice. Today, it is peace, is the "no-choice" option for all of us. Whatever tensions there might have been between the two men over the Jordanian peace talks, they were all smiles in December 1994, as they, along with Yasser Arafat, traveled to Oslo to accept the Nobel Prize for Peace. The dream of peace represented by the Oslo Accords is soon facing serious challenges. Many were hoping that Arafat would grow into a similar kind of peace partner as Anwar Sadat or King Hussein, but less than a year after Oslo was signed, growing numbers of Israelis are becoming convinced that he is unable or unwilling to give up terrorism. After signing the May 1994 Gaza/Jericho Agreement, that is part of the Oslo Accords, Yasser Arafat arrives in Gaza to start the process of governing, but hidden in the vehicles of his motorcade are weapons and terrorists he's allowed to be smuggled into the newly proclaimed Palestinian Authority. Throughout the fall of 1994 and well into 1995, terrorist attacks erupt against Israelis by Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist Palestinian group founded in the late 1980s, and another group, the Islamic Jihad. Israelis now take to the streets to protest against the Oslo Accords, aiming much of their fury at Prime Minister Rabin. They painted him in the uniform of Hitler. They painted him in the uniform of Hitler. I got my portion too. I was also attacked and threatened. A peace rally at Kings of Israel Square, the largest in Tel Aviv, is held to mobilize support for the government. Rabin is not optimistic about what it will achieve. When the rally opened, it was the greatest surprise. When the rally opened, it was the greatest surprise. They say it was the largest gathering... and young people, and enthusiastic. And they shouted: "Rabin! Rabin! Rabin!" We knew each other a very long time. He never embraced me. I never heard him sing. And there he was embracing, happy, singing. That was his happiest day in his life. When the rally ends, Rabin and Peres leave for their cars. The prime minister returning to his Tel Aviv home, and Peres for business in Jerusalem. And I arrived at the door of my car And I arrived at the door of my car and I heard the shots. And all of a sudden, the security people pushed me in the car. I said: "What happened to Yitzhak?" They wouldn't tell me. I said, "What do you mean, you don't tell me?" So, one of them says: "He was taken to the hospital." I said: "Go to the hospital." He says: "No. We have orders not to let you move." So, I said: "I'm my own boss, so I'm going to walk." It wasn't far away. They saw that I am serious, so they decided to take the car and they brought me to the hospital. The head of the hospital asked to see me aside... and then he whispered, he says: "He's no longer alive." We found Leah. I told her, "Unfortunately, Yitzhak is no longer alive." He was lying on a bed, half the body covered. She embraced him and kissed him. And then I embraced him and kissed him. The government of Israel announces in shock, The government of Israel announces in shock, with great sorrow and deep grief, the death of Prime Minister and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin who was murdered by an assassin tonight in Tel Aviv. Everybody was so shocked. Everybody was so shocked. It didn't take a few moments. The whole place was full with young girls and boys, crying like babies, and the whole nation was crying. Shimon is unanimously named by the Cabinet to replace Yitzhak Rabin as Israel's prime minister. Many around him insist he call for early elections, predicting he would win by a landslide against his likely opponent, the Likud Party's Benjamin Netanyahu, but Peres refuses. I told myself: "No. I told myself: "No. I'm not going to take advantage of such a tragedy." Peres took it much more to the heart than people realized. Peres was very deeply wounded and hurt by the death of Rabin, and when he spoke about him as "my elder brother," he meant it. I felt like I was cut in half, you know. I felt like I was cut in half, you know. Our relations at the last days were really brilliant. It was such a heavy load. And, you know, in those moments you really don't know whom to ask for advice. Those are the most lonely moments in your life. A new series of terrorist attacks starting in February 1996 soon overshadows everything Shimon Peres has been trying to accomplish to heal the nation. In less than ten days, in five separate incidents in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, over 60 people are killed and almost 300 wounded in bombing attacks on buses. The worst is a suicide bombing on crowded Dizengoff Street in central Tel Aviv, killing 14 and wounding 157. I called in Arafat. I called in Arafat. I said: "What are you doing?" He said: "I shall stop it." He arrested hundreds of the heads of Hamas. A little bit too late and too slow. I knew in my heart that I lost the elections. Benjamin Netanyahu defeats Shimon Peres by just one percentage point. At 47 years of age, he becomes the youngest prime minister in Israel's history. Shimon Peres is now back in the Knesset as leader of the opposition. Speaking forcefully against the policies of the new prime minister. It is necessary to keep up with the momentum of peacemaking. It is necessary to keep up with the momentum of peacemaking. But in the evening, a curious development is taking place. Shimon was the head of the opposition. He was fighting Bibi everyday in Parliament, and at night, Bibi would send him a car and take him to his home in Jerusalem. And they spent night after night together, Shimon instructing Bibi how to deal with the Palestinians, how to speak with Arafat. With all his experience, with the peace talks with the Palestinians. For Shimon, it was only normal to help Bibi because that was for the state of Israel, and for Bibi it was only normal to turn to this older statesman who knew what he was talking about. A year after his defeat, Shimon Peres steps down as the chairman of the Labor Party. In 1999, Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition collapses and the Labor Party's new leader, Ehud Barak, wins the Prime Minister's Office in a landslide. A few months later, a financial scandal forces President Ezer Weizman to resign before the end of his term. Shimon Peres emerges as the leading candidate to take his place. Plans are being made for an inauguration celebration. They're premature. When the vote takes place in the Knesset, several lawmakers who pledged their support for Peres switch their allegiance to his opponent, a little known political figure outside of Israel named Moshe Katsav. Shimon loses by six votes. He's humiliated, not only before the Knesset, but in front of his family and the nation. March 2001, Ariel Sharon defeats Ehud Barak almost two to one, becoming Israel's eleventh prime minister. Despite his hardliner reputation, two years later, he announces a proposal to evacuate all Jewish settlements and unilaterally withdraw the IDF from the Gaza Strip, handing it over completely to the Palestinian Authority by 2005. The Likud and its right wing coalition partners go into open revolt. Shimon Peres expresses his support for the disengagement. We didn't agree on many things, We didn't agree on many things, but we kept our friendly relations. He trusted me. I liked him. He said: "Shimon, I want a favor. Ask Sonya to prepare a dinner that I like." Usually her dish was chicken in honey. "But I am not coming just to enjoy the dinner. I'm going to tell you that I'm contemplating to make a revolution." The revolution is a new political party called Kadima or "Forward" in English. He would run in the upcoming elections and he wanted Shimon to join him. The greatest builder of settlements, all of a sudden took a different direction. On one hand, he was a great warrior. On the other hand, he understood that we need peace. But Ariel Sharon would never see Kadima come to fruition in the March 2006 elections. He suffers a massive stroke in early January, entering into a coma from which he will never recover. Kadima wins handily with Ehud Olmert at its head, and Shimon agrees to serve as deputy prime minister in the new coalition. At almost 83 years of age, he's back at the highest ranks of government. Although he's praised for joining Kadima, others, including some old friends, criticize him for abandoning Labor. June 2007. President Katsav resigns after being accused of rape and sexual harassment. Almost immediately, Shimon Peres is being discussed as the most logical and best replacement. While he's willing to run, there are strong reservations within the Peres family. We were having a family Shabbat dinner at my parents' house, and he said: "Let's have a vote." And I must confess that I voted against. And my vote was a vote of love because I still had a very strong memory of what happened the first time around. Sonya is the most strongly opposed. She wants him to turn down the position and retire. Sonya told me: "My dear, enough is enough. Sonya told me: "My dear, enough is enough. You are working day and night, years after years. The time has come. You'll take a rest." Despite Sonya's feelings, Peres consents to be put up once again as a candidate for the presidency. In June 2007, he wins overwhelmingly, becoming Israel's ninth president. It is just two months before his 84th birthday. And I went to Shimon, said: "Shimon, Sonya says she's not coming with you to Jerusalem." He said, "She will." I told her: "Sonya, I don't do it for pleasure. As long as the country calls me, as long as I can serve, you must understand." She didn't want to come with me to the Presidency. She herself remained in Tel Aviv, and I came to Jerusalem. She asked him to take his affairs out of the house, his books, and he wanted to very much to get her back. He sent her all kind of messages in interviews he gave to the papers. That was very, very sad. They were two people who really loved each other very deeply, even when they were separated. The Presidency, since Israel's founding, has largely been a ceremonial position. Shimon Peres decides to revitalize and redefine the office. He went all over the world and he was the symbol of Israel and the symbol of maturity, of moderation, of vision, of fighting for peace. He became the president of everybody. The most dramatic thing was when he went to Germany, when he went to Berlin and he spoke at the Reichstag. Hitler's place. And Shimon walks in and puts his skullcap, and speaks about his grandfather who was burned alive by the Nazis and then he says Kaddish. That was a very dramatic and very symbolic moment. I am proud of the revival of Israel, the moral and historic answer to the attempt to erase the Jewish people from the face of the earth. Jewish history continues to move forward on two parallel tracks: The moral track, encapsulated in the Ten Commandments. The document which was written some three thousand years ago. And the scientific track, which unravels hidden secrets concealed in the past from the eyes of men, and which, unraveled, change our lives. I started with the memorial prayer and will end with Israel's national anthem. Our hope is not lost. The hope of 2,000 years... to be free people in our land, land of Zion and Jerusalem. Thank you all. Only Shimon could do it. Nobody else. President Shimon Peres also becomes one of the most trusted statesmen on the international arena. Leaders from all around the world make it their business to seek him out for advice and counsel. My view of leadership is you got to lead for a better tomorrow, but leaders should also look beyond the horizon and think strategically on behalf of people. Shimon Peres certainly did. And I spent a lot of time talking to him about his view of how to help the region grow peacefully, and I believe ultimately that'll happen. Shimon was a model for me in many ways, but most particularly, because of the spirit that he brought to politics, which was always and enduringly the spirit of the optimist. When I left office and became involved in the politics of the Middle East and the peace process, Shimon was someone I consulted a lot, and someone who also gave me hope that something can be achieved because he himself never lost hope, never gave up believing that in the end there would be a peace between Israel and its neighbors. I was still a senator. At that point, I wasn't a sure thing, to be president. When I was visiting Israel after I had won the nomination, Shimon asked if we could have a little bit of time together. The genuine interest he had taken in my campaign, the degree to which he expressed hope that the kind of optimistic politics that I was trying to represent was something that could be duplicated and captured in the Middle East. It was, I think, a great... and flattering moment for me. One of our strongest allies and one of our closest friends is the State of Israel. And no individual has done so much over so many years to build our alliance and to bring our two nations closer as our friend, Shimon Peres. On January 20, 2011, Shimon Peres received word that Sonya died peacefully in her sleep in the Tel Aviv apartment they once shared. Deeply in grief, he rushes to Tel Aviv to be with his children and grandchildren. Sonya's funeral is held the following day. Her wish is to be buried at Ben Shemen, a place she always loved and where she met Shimon in 1940. When her gravestone is unveiled 30 days later, a second monument is also uncovered. On it is a message from her husband, "I loved you from the first moment I saw you. I will love you until the last. Shimon." Sonya was an unusual person. Sonya was an unusual person. No ceremony. She never appeared in the press. She never appeared publicly. Many organizations asked her to chair them. She agreed to sweep the floors. After her death, I discovered she took half of our salaries and sent it, without writing who is the sender, to people who asked for help. Our home was very modest. But she also educated the children to be honest, to serve the people, not to try and make an impression. And to this very day, I have tears in my eyes... thank her for what she did for the children. Happy birthday! As Shimon Peres enters the final year of his presidency, a gala celebration is held at Jerusalem's International Convention Center on the occasion of his 90th birthday. Among the 3,000 invited guests are family and friends, movie stars and entertainers, dignitaries and world leaders. The highlight of the evening is a special performance by Barbra Streisand. The Oscar and Grammy award-winning actress, director, and singer, is a favorite of the president, who is known to play her albums to relax after a long day serving as the then oldest leader in the world. Ms. Streisand performs her signature song, "People," as well as the classic high holiday prayer, "Avinu Malkeinu." It was a request from President Peres. He loved those two songs. I've always loved Avinu Malkeinu. It's a crying out, and I said at that event: "Avinu Malkeinu asks God to help bring an end to war and famine and cause all hate and oppression to vanish from the Earth." So the song appeals to our best selves and reminds us to strive for the kind of world that Shimon fought so hard, so hard to create. As President Peres approaches the final days of his term in office, many Israelis openly lament that he cannot stay in office indefinitely. But in July 2014, Shimon Peres ends his term as required by law. The question that was really very much on people's minds back then was what will he do next? That's how we came up with this concept of a video. Mr. President, are you done packing? I'm working on it. Have you decided what to do next? Working on that too. WANTED ADS So what kind of experience do you have? I was an excellent cow milker. It's all automated these days. I was also a shepherd, never lost a sheep! So you have no experience. Well, let's try and hope for the best. Full tank please. -Water and oil? -No, thanks. Would you like a six-pack of bottled water? Not interested. -Dora floaties? -No! Can I please pay? Go in peace! It's the only solution! They said 45 minutes. It's been almost an hour. It's not a long journey, but getting to this point was so hard. I'm sorry. Thanks. How about a tip? Coach, I can't do it! The future belongs to those who dare! Let's go. We have lots of work to do. There's nothing here. When there's nothing, you can do anything! Shimon Peres marches into the next phase of his life and redefines his so-called retirement, much as he had other jobs he'd taken for more than 70 years. He's a keynote speaker at international forums, like Davos and Geneva. And the TED Talks. He is also, with the help of his son Chemi, expanding the mission of the Peres Center for Peace, founded in the late 1990s, located in a mixed Jewish and Arab neighborhood in Jaffa, adjacent to Tel Aviv. They're transforming it into The Peres Center for Peace and Innovation, promoting Israel's high technology sector, which Peres helped to give birth to when he developed Dimona. He was one of the founders of the start-up nation and basically turned Israel into a state of science and technology, and he always looked about the next technologies that Israel need to embrace in order to continue its journey to the future. The Innovation Center, by bringing together Arabs and Jews, especially Israeli Arabs, but also Palestinians, these links between Israelis and Palestinians, that can be a kind of corridor to peace, and it's very symbolic that he started that. That became his testament, actually. For more than 92 years, Shimon Peres has never given much thought to his health, which has always been robust. He continues to maintain a schedule that would exhaust people half his age. But in January 2016, he suffers what is later described as a minor heart attack. Peres recovers quickly and is back in action making speeches, traveling and starting work on a new, very personal memoir. In August 2016, he celebrates his 93rd birthday. A month later, on September 13, Peres addresses a group of high tech entrepreneurs, speaking for more than an hour about Israel and his world view. And after lunch, he did not feel well. And then the team decided to send him to the hospital to do routine checks, and in the afternoon, while he was there, he experienced a stroke. While the stroke is a major one, there is some hope that President Peres might recover. But as the days pass, his condition deteriorates. He passed away on the 28th of September, just before the holiday, Rosh Hashanah. On the day of the funeral, I published a piece in the paper that I write for Yedioth Ahronoth. And then I wrote about the incredible outpouring of concern and love that we experienced. Everyone, to a certain degree, lost a father and a grandfather. He was controversial in some ways, and not everybody liked him throughout his life, but there was no doubt, especially in his later years, that his heart was in the right place and that what he did, he did for us, for our future, and for our children. And I think he personified a sense of hope about what Israel can and should aspire to be. My father never gave up. Even in the worst situations, he managed to rise up again and face tomorrow. Always with optimism, always with a belief that there's no limit to what we can do, and what we can achieve, if we only dream and if we only imagine. The solace that we found is with the fact that he left a tremendous legacy and the notion that he lived a full life, a meaningful life, and he left the world gracefully. And he managed to complete everything that he had in mind, besides one thing, which is realizing the dream of peace to its entirety. But I believe that he knew that that day will come, even though he will not live to see it. By the time that I came to work with Shimon, he was in the twilight of his years, although he might not admit it. I took great pleasure in my friendship with this older, wiser man. Shimon Peres reminds us that the State of Israel, like the United States of America, was not built by cynics, and Shimon Peres was never cynical. It is that faith, that optimism, that belief, even when all the evidence is to the contrary, that tomorrow can be better. That makes us not just honor Shimon Peres, but love him. His critics often claimed he was a naive, overly optimistic dreamer. They were only wrong about the naive part. He knew exactly what he was doing in being overly optimistic. He knew exactly what he was doing with his dreams. If those of us who loved him from near and far accept our duty to keep his gifts alive, in his honor, I ask that we remember Shimon Peres' luminous smile. And imagine. In 1998, Shimon Peres wrote a short book entitled The Imaginary Voyage, in which he envisioned Theodor Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, returning to a land he had only visited once, now the modern state of Israel. In this imagining, Shimon takes Herzl from one end of the country to the other, proudly showing the founding father what his dreams had given birth to. At the end of the journey, as Peres brings Herzl to the Galilee, not far from the kibbutz he found at Alumot, he writes: "And so, Herzl and I end our imaginary voyage. Joining us are the millions of all the generations who, over the course of the centuries, made up the Jewish people. Those who lived here before the Roman rule and those who lived after. The poets from Spain, China, and Vishneva. The disciples of the Baal Shem Tov and the Vilna Gaon. The survivors of the massacres during the Middle Ages and of the Shoah. They were all gathered to listen to Herzl recite the words that came spontaneously to his lips at the first Zionist congress in Basel. 'If you will it, it is no dream.'" I think my real talent was to dream. I think my real talent was to dream. I never accepted things as they are. You have to dream. You have to imagine. You have really to take risks, and don't be afraid. I'm telling the young people, that each of you, every girl and every boy, are richer, and deeper, and better than you think. Look in yourself. Keep your curiosity. Keep your trust. And don't be disappointed if you won't achieve it in a fortnight. No, it's a long march. But it doesn't mean when you are a dreamer, you have to dream the same thing all the time. Now Zionism was a dream. We were 2,000 years without land, in exile, and Herzl dreamed that the day will come, and we shall have a new old land, as he called it. We achieved. Now we have new dreams. Maybe finally we shall come to a land that has more perfection than the land today. The search of perfection is our great voyage. What I am doing is not dreaming. What I am doing is opening my eyes.
