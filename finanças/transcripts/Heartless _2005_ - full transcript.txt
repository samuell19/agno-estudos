[music playing] [doorbell] DAVID (VOICEOVER): This story had everything going for it. A beautiful woman, widely admired in the community as a lawyer to the less fortunate. And for her other charms, a whole string of boyfriends. MIRANDA: Hi, can I help you? Delivery for Mr. Roberts Vieira? DAVID (VOICEOVER): I'd heard she was dating Vieira. He was a step up for her. From suburban respectability to the inner circle of the very wealthy. I'll take it. DAVID (VOICEOVER): It was a world she desperately wanted into. Here you go. Thank you. DAVID (VOICEOVER): Oh, she was irresistible, all right, to all kinds of men. As I was about to find out. I needed to find out who she really was. Ms. Miranda Wells. Who was that? Robert, I didn't know you had property in the Bahamas. You signed for my mail? Miranda Vieira? Well, you don't have to make it sound that impossible. I got to be at the office in an hour. So maybe you'd better get dressed. Why, don't you test me alone in your house? I didn't say that. No, but it's written all over your face. You're afraid that I'm going to wave some magic wand and take away all of your bachelor freedom. I gotta get going. DAVID (VOICEOVER): She was smart. She was a pro at twisting people and twisting the truth. I needed someone on the inside, someone she trusted. I was thinking I'd start by talking to Miranda's assistant, Carla Arujo. [speaks spanish] Do you remember that time when you made the elephant? [speaks spanish] Miranda. - Don't worry. - I am worried. Don't be. She's going to be in court all morning. The whole thing won't take more than 10 minutes. And you're sure you know where they are? Right there in front of me the whole time. Practically staring me in the face. Once you get them you're going straight to Harding's office, right? You stop. I'm telling you, nothing's going to go wrong. [gasp] Get out of the car. Both of you. [gunshot] [screaming] Somebody, help me! We've got something. POLICE: This perp dumps a ski mask in porta-potty, he must be an amateur. When was the first time you met her. She came to my office about six months ago. She felt she had evidence that her boss was defrauding illegal immigrants. She wanted to know if I could do something about it. So you have been trying to get Wells disbarred? Me and several other legitimate lawyers in this town. Except there's never been sufficient evidence to press charges. Until she got the goods on Wells. She found files describing immigrants paying thousands for green cards they never received. And couldn't sue for, because they were illegal to begin with. Well, where are they now? The files, I mean? Beats me. Why don't you ask your boy Russ? Russ, who? One of Wells's boyfriends. Russ Carter. You mean, Russ Carter the cop from Elridge? MIRANDA: Hey, Hector. Give me a shot. Hey, hot stuff. How you doing, babe? Hello, Dean. I thought you were in Texas. DEAN: Well, you know how it is. MIRANDA: Is there something I can do for you? I got this friend down in central lockup. Told him I'd hook him up with the best. The best doesn't come cheap, does she? No, she don't. But I tell you what, babe. This dude is desperate, you know what I'm saying? You don't say. Look, his name's Perry Henden. Just talk with him, all right? That's all he's asking. I'll see what I can do. What do you have to flirt with this trash for? [laughter] Because they're my clients. What was so important that I had to drop everything and come and see you? Internal Affairs called me, to talk about the Arujo shooting. They want me to give a DNA sample. And you refused, right? Well, yeah. Well then you have nothing to worry about. You're a cop. Well, yeah, but they suspect me. They know we've been dating. Darling, you're being ridiculous. I loved Carla like a sister, everybody knows that. And no one would suspect you of such a hideous crime. You're not a little concerned? Of course not. Now relax. I have to go. I'm a very busy woman, you know. Oh, I know. [buzzer] Your friend Dean said you were desperate. Simple assault, attempted rape, aggravated rape, check fraud, burglary, second degree assault. You've got quite a curriculum dete. That mean you like me? Oh, what's not to like. The two time loser who nearly sliced his last victims arm off while relieving her of her purse? Well, woman ought to hold a purse so she don't get hurt. It's a novel defense. It'll face an uphill battle in court. Which is why I need the best. Thing is, you think you can handle me? I've handled many men such as yourself. Oh, yeah? You get off on handling dangerous men? You asking me to get you off, Perry? Yeah. You understand that you would have to do whatever I tell you, whenever I tell you? Uh-huh. I'll be in touch. Hey, wait a minute. ELEONOR (ON PHONE): Miranda Wells' office. Hi, any calls? ELEONOR (ON PHONE): Miss Wells, Mr. Vieira called to cancel dinner. Did he say why? ELEONOR (ON PHONE): Well, just that he was feeling kind of tired. OK, anything else? ELEONOR (ON PHONE): No. All right. Thank you. Surprise, surprise. I left a message with your secretary. I hope she gave it to you. She did. It's just that I was in the neighborhood, and I wanted to bring this by for you. Can I get you something to drink? Sure. You know, I never get tired of looking at this art collection. Me neither. Except when I have to pay the insurance premiums. Hm. You still angry with me about the other day? I'm not angry. It's just that I've always been upfront about not wanting a committed relationship, and it just seems that lately... And I've been pushing for more. I know. But that's really not true. I just want to have fun. Like we always have. Yeah, well. As long as we're clear. Don't you want to unwrap your gift? It's right there, silly. Heh, I don't think it's my size. Well, I just thought that if a really naughty girl is going to get spanked that she ought to wear her really sorry clothes. DAVID (VOICEOVER): My name is David Lopez, and after a week of looking for someone who would talk to me about Miranda Wells, I was batting zero. I came up with a new plan, and a new name, and decided to meet Miss Wells for myself. MIRANDA: Just exactly what part of incompetent do you not understand? MAN (ON PHONE): What do you want? What do I want? How about someone who can spell the word lawyer. I'm Rick Mendez to see Miranda Wells. OK, you can just have a seat. MAN (ON PHONE): The person we sent was very qualified. MIRANDA: No, what you sent me was a lobotomized moron who had no business being in a law office except maybe to take out the trash. [click] [buzzer] Yes, Miss Wells? Will you send in the handsome gentleman that just walked in? Miss Wells will see you now. [speaks spanish] Hi. Rick Mendez. And you speak English. Well, that can be very helpful. I can spell the word lawyer, if that's what you're talking about. And you have a sense of humor. The question is, will that help me get a green card. I understand you're the best. I have had a lot of experience in these matters, but why don't you tell me a little bit about your situation? After eight years in this country I've managed apartment buildings, but never been asked to join the management company. Even program computers for an HMO, but never qualified to receive medical benefits. And now you're tired of pressing your face up against the glass, and you want to be let into the party, is that it? Does that mean you can help me? Oh, yes, there's a great deal I can do to help you. But I should ask, first if... $10,000. $5,000 up front, $5,000 once I've secured the documents. That's... that's a lot of money. Does that mean that you're not up to the challenge? I don't understand. Computers, for example. You say that you have a far ranging experience with them. Do you think that you could handle a system like mine? I don't think I'd be a very good secretary. I already have a secretary. What I need is an assistant. Someone who can accomplish whatever I need, whenever I need it, 24/7. How would that be for starters? What about my green card? Within a year. The cost of which will be deducted from your salary. Well then it's settled, no? You start tomorrow, 8:00 AM. Hell of a story, Dave, but... DAVID: One bombshell lawyer rips off Latino immigrants, who never get the green cards they pay for, and never get the justice they deserve, because they're illegal to begin with. Yeah. But right now you have no proof. And Wells is on record vowing to vigorously defend against charges like these, which translates into suing our pants off. Even if we get a writer working on the inside? Did you go undercover? Meet Rick Mendez, illegal. In search of a green card, maybe. She just hired me as her office assistant. Don't you see? I'm in. Have you seen the files on the others. No, not yet, but I will. And when I do, I'm telling you, there's Pulitzers in this for me and this paper. Maybe. But until I see those files, we never had this conversation. Well, thanks for the support. Speaking of support, you ought to talk to a lawyer named Mitch Harding. He's been trying to get Wells disbarred for years. He can fill you in on all the requirements. Requirements for what? For vetting this paper, Dave, because we're not touching this story until it's airtight. OK? So if you want that Pulitzer, talk to Harding. And Dave? Be careful. DAVID (VOICEOVER): He was being a hard ass, but then Harding told me what had happened to Miranda's last assistant. A reality I didn't want to hear. I don't care if you hand her to me on a silver platter. I'm just not interested. I thought you were anxious to shut this lady down. Maybe I finally realized there's some things in life that just can't be done. Even if I'm on the inside? Do you have any idea what happened to the last person who was on the inside? You mean her assistant? Her name is Carla Arujo, and for your information she also tried to get the goods on Wells. So she was fired. So? More like fired at. This after seeing her husband gunned down in the driveway of their house. How do you know it was Miranda? This isn't the first time someone close to Miranda has ended up missing or dead Yeah, well, stories like this don't come along every day. So I'm going after this with you or without you. What do you want from me? Just watch my back. No one else is going to know what I'm up to except you MacIntyre. I trust MacIntyre about as far as I can throw him. And you trust me? Yeah. I do. [beeping] How is she, Doctor? Are you a relative, or... No, I'm just a friend who loves her very much. I see. She will recover, won't she? Well, we're still hopeful. But every day that she doesn't regain consciousness makes it just that much more likely that she won't. I see. Could I have moment with her? - Sure. OK. Dear, dear Carla. Can you hear me? Do you know who this is? Do you know that I'm watching you all the time? Watching and waiting, all the time, dear, dear Carla. ELEONOR: She keeps the files all on the computer, that was Carla's job so I'm afraid I'm not going to be very much help. What's IN? Immigration and naturalization. I'm saying that you can't use Alshold's statement against Henden if Alshold is unavailable for me to cross-examine. RON (ON PHONE): Wrong. Alshold's statement was made after his arrest, and after he was mirandized. I don't think that that's right. RON (ON PHONE): So the way I see it, Barry Henden's going down for felony assault, robbery, and attempted murder. DAVID (VOICEOVER): I didn't know who Barry Henden was. Can you hang on, please? DAVID (VOICEOVER): But I could see he was important to Miranda. Eleanor, give me the Henden file. Miss Wells? I think this... Not now. I think this is what you're looking for. Listen to this, Ron. Evidence is considered testimonial when it is made in the expectation of use in a criminal proceeding, and when out of court testimonial statements are at issue the only indicative of reliability is the one the Constitution prescribes, which is confrontation. You're kidding. I have never been more serious in my life. [click] This is Rick Mendez calling from Miranda Wells office to reschedule Monday's deposition. All right, we have Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon. Wednesday at 2:30. Thank you. MIRANDA: Can you come here? DAVID (VOICEOVER): I was on track for employee of the month. In fact things were moving faster than I realized. Don't just stand there. DAVID (VOICEOVER): In a way I hadn't planned on. You know if you're trying to impress me, you're succeeding. You know it is Friday night. I'm just trying to finish the last couple of files. No wife? No girlfriend waiting? Not currently. Why don't you turn out the lights? DAVID (VOICEOVER): But if it was a game she was playing, I didn't know the rules. So I decided to stick with the game I knew, and where I did know the rules. It's being a good reporter. Rule number one, maintain objectivity. Somehow I'd have to get close, and still keep my distance. I knew if I stayed focused on the story, I could stay one step ahead of Miranda. MIRANDA: I have to go. RUSS: As usual. You know I don't want to. RUSS: Self-doubt. Let's run away. Run away where? Argentina. I think a ranch down in Argentina. We could get a huge parcel for practically nothing. What would we do in Argentina? Live. Like normal people for a change. Maybe raise a family. Why don't we just do that here? I don't know. I guess I'd have to ask Vieira. I already told you, we are just friends. Yeah. Yeah. Real good friends from what I can see. He's very wealthy, and he can open doors for me, so that someday we can buy that ranch. 10,000 acres, and kids and dogs and horses. One of those triangle things that you ring to call for supper. You mean that? I mean it with all my heart. [knocking] RUSS: Russ? Who is it? STEVE: Russ, it's me, Steve [inaudible],, open up. What are you doing here? Come on in. Maybe it would be better if we did this outside. Did what? Anything you have to say to him, you can say in front of me. Where's the arrest warrant? You're under arrest for the murder of Danny Arujo, and the attempted murder of Carla Arujo. I had nothing to do with that. Don't say anything. You don't have any evidence. We have a ski mask from outside the Arujo's house, and we matched the saliva on the fibers to yours. Without a sample from him? I don't think so. We had the toothpick he tossed away in the police locker room. We have three witnesses who saw you throw it away, and the lab says DNA matches. You had the right to remain silent. Don't say a word. You have a right to an attorney. I am his attorney. If you cannot afford one... MIRANDA: I am his attorney. One will be appointed for you. MIRANDA: Do not say a word, Russ. He is not saying anything. Why are you doing this to yourself, Russ? I don't know what you're talking about. Before she went into a coma, the victim says she was attacked by a man and a woman. So what? You think Mrs. Arujo might recognize your voice if we put you two in a room together? Huh? You think her testimony, along with your DNA, might place you at the scene of the crime wearing the black ski mask? Look, the DA's prepared to cut a deal, right now, if you'll testify that Wells put you up to it. Come on, Russ. We know it was Miranda's plan from the start. You guys got no evidence. We got you, and you'll take the fall for the whole chalupa unless you testify against her. RECEPTIONIST: Ms. Wells is waiting for you in your office. What are you doing here? I think we need a break. What? I made reservations to fly to Vegas, dinner at Morton's. Wait a minute. I don't believe this. What? Don't you see? I've taken care of everything. Yeah, well, I'm kind of busy right now, so maybe you... But that's just it. I cleared everything with your secretary, and we have three whole days together. You cleared my schedule? Yeah. Robert, we just need some time, that's all. And I'm going to make you so happy, like I always do. You want to make me happy? Get out of my life. I don't understand. That's because you're sick, Miranda. You're so screwed up by your own fantasies you can't even see that it's over between us. You don't mean that. Yes, I do. I don't want to see you anymore, I don't want to talk to you anymore. I just want you out of my life. Is that clear? Do you have any idea who you're talking to? All right, this has gone far enough. Do you have any idea how many men would kill to be with me? Call security. Yes, sir. This isn't over yet. [television speaking spanish] DAVID (VOICEOVER): Being Rick Mendez wasn't leaving much time for David Lopez to do his job. Rule number two, know your subject. [phone ringing] Yeah. Hello? MIRANDA (ON PHONE): How soon can you get over here? Miss... Miss Wells. Are you all right? MIRANDA (ON PHONE): 302 Senate Drive. I'll be waiting. [click] [doorbell] DAVID (VOICEOVER): Right then I should have walked away. [buzzer] The reporter in me knew better. But David Lopez, the man, was tempted. MIRANDA (ON SPEAKER): Come on in. [buzzer] Hello, Rick. How are you? Good. You OK? Come here. Do you like a drink? No, thanks. Then get me one. It's over there on the bar. And bring me that envelope while you're at it. A man who can anticipate a woman's needs is a rare quality. I really appreciated your help with the Henden file the other day. Go ahead, open it. Consider it a bonus. And I thought since you were here that we could maybe put in a couple of hours of work. Is that all right with you? You mean now? Yeah. OK. MIRANDA: Dear Senor Maldonado, regarding your application... RUSS: Shut up, Vieira. Did you want to take this down, or are you going to memorize it? Dear Senor Maldonado, regarding your application to the immigration service I am at this time pursuing every avenue of opportunity. [typing] And I feel confident that we will be successful in the very near future. However, please be aware that the retainer for my services has been exhausted. DAVID (VOICEOVER): I smelled a setup. I left the money on the table, and went home with my integrity intact. But Miranda was not the kind of woman who takes no for an answer. STEVE: If we could go over it again. You're saying you were at home last night from 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM. You make that sound surprising. Were you surprised that Robert Vieira's brains were splattered across his garage last night? I loved him. You would never understand the way I felt. I understand conspiracy to murder. Are you charging me with a crime? I'm asking you for the last time where were you last night? As I stated, I was at home. And if you don't believe me, you can ask my assistant. Your assistant. Do you have a problem with that, detective? [music playing] Do you mind if I turn off the muzak? Yeah. Miss Wells likes it on. Miss Wells isn't here right now. Brilliant. I'm going home now. Do what you want. DAVID (VOICEOVER): What I wanted was the files. I knew I was very close. Oh, I was focused all right. So focused I couldn't see the web Miranda was spinning around me. DAVID: OK, here we go. Immigration. Rick Mendez? Yes? Detective Cantrell. Detective Siler. Can I help you? You can start by telling us where you were last night. I was working late, why? Were you working by yourself? No, I was with my boss, Miss Wells. Why? One of your bosses boyfriends was bludgeoned to death in his garage last night. What does this have to do with me? You're her alibi. LAWYER: Your honor, this is a police detective presently being represented on a murder charge by counsel who is arguably a co-defendant in these proceedings. DA: Objection, your honor. The DA cannot produce one shred of evidence that involves me in this case. And if the DA continues with this slanderous attack, I will file suit against the state. That's highly unusual, Miss Wells. Even for you. The charges against my client are baseless, your honor. The DA has some personal vendetta against me. Your honor, there's nothing baseless about the defendant's DNA matching samples found at the site... Not found. Planted. This is an officer whose familiarity with police techniques and weapons makes him not just a flight risk, but a danger to this community. MIRANDA: Mr. Carter is a decorated veteran and police officer. He poses no danger. All right. You've made your point. But given the background and circumstances surrounding this case, I'm remanding the defendant back to Parish jail pending trial. Your honor, this is an outrage. Bail denied. Court's adjourned. I'll get you out, don't worry. Let's go. Well, looks like we got you this time, Miranda. Really. Got a dead solid case against Russ. And even if he doesn't roll over on you, there's still Carla Arujo. Carla Arujo is in a coma. Yeah, but what if she wakes up, and IDs you as her second assailant? What if she wakes up and declares that Miss Miranda Wells is the kindest, most loving person in the world? Did you ever think about that? You're really something. Oh, you ain't seen nothing yet. Hello, Rick. You don't seem very happy to see me. I don't like being used as an alibi. What makes you think that's the case? It's what the police think that matters. The police serve the rule of law. They are not the arbiters of truth or justice. Robert Vieira was a client, and we dated a few times. But his death is as much a mystery to me as it is to them. And the fact that I could swear that you were somewhere else while he was being murdered is just coincidence? If my attraction to you just put you in an awkward position, then I apologize. I offer you my affection, and you reject me. I offer you money, and you leave it in my house. I don't want your money. What do you want, Rick? Hm? I want my green card. That's all you want from life? Green card? Nothing more? I do my job, I try not to expect too much, yeah? That is so sad, it just makes me want to cry. Oh, please. I'm sorry, I think that you deserve more out of life. I'll keep that in mind. Why do you hate me? I don't hate you. Do you want me? Hm? Do you want me, Rick? Just tell me, and I'll stop. [music playing] Hey. Thank you. Any regrets? Not yet. Not yet. This all started because I needed a green card. And now your horizons have expanded. You're even starting to lose your accent. Don't worry, I like you anyway. Why do you listen to this junk? Don't you like it? Do you? You get used to it. Here. This is for you. Go ahead, open it. I can't accept this. Why? Are you afraid? DAVID: Of what? Of getting in too deep. I think I can handle it. MIRANDA: I got your message. MAN: What are you trying to pull, Miranda? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, yeah? I never told you to do anything, and I never sent you anywhere. And if you claim that I did, I will swear in open court that you are a liar. Robert Vieira was my friend. Yeah, well, I'd sure hate to be your enemy. You should remember that. I am the best lawyer that you ever had, and the only chance that you got to not die in prison. So that money that you think that I owe you? You just apply that to my fee. You're playing a dangerous game, lady. And I always win. [beeping] Carla? Carla, can you hear me? Carla? Look at me, Carla. Carla. Good. Hi. Here's that file. Great, thank you. Will you tell Rick to get in here right now, please? Rick? Miss Wells wants to see you right away. I'll be there in a second. So... Just drop whatever you're doing and go in. I'll be right back. I need you to file these with the court right away, and pick up my dry cleaning. Yeah. You know, I didn't sign up to be your errand boy. Oh yes, you did. You signed on to do whatever I need, whenever I need it. Isn't that right? Fine. MIRANDA: Rick? What's this? Well, I didn't want you to have to pay for my dry cleaning out of your salary. This is a lot of money. I know. You can thank me later. NURSE: Meet me in the cafeteria. Carla. Wake up, darling. Carla. Oh my God. Oh my God. You won't be needing this. What do you want? I want you to be careful, Carla. You killed my husband. No. You killed Danny. No, I am your friend, and I want what's best for you. And you really need to take some time right now. Time to rest, time and think, time to get away from all the pressures here, and all the danger. Oh my God. Oh my God. That's right, it's good to pray. And when you're done, you really should think about taking a long vacation. Maybe back to Mexico. Maybe even to stay. I'm sure that you'll find the best place for you. I know you'll do the right thing, Carla. You always were so smart. Keys. Hey. Hey. What's up? I'm kind of on my way out. I lost my keys, though. The Pulitzer Prize committee sent me, said you were missing in action. Although it looks like things have been going pretty good for you. So what? She likes me. Big deal. Thanks. Are you aware that she's under suspicion for another murder besides the Danny Arujo? If you mean Vieira, they'll never make it stick. How did you know? I was with her the night he was murdered. Look, its none of my business... That's right, it's not, so lay off. I mean, I know what doing. I'll call you the minute I get the files. You know, that's what Carla Arujo said. And she's come out of her coma. She's not talking to anyone. Not to me, not to the cops. Looks to me she's more scared than ever. Hey, I'll keep my eyes open. It's a good idea. ED BRUNET: This is the most outrageous stunt I have ever seen. For Miss Wells to claim a right to inherit as Mr. Vieira's wife is criminally fraudulent at worst, and at best nothing more than wishful thinking. What about Robert's wishes? He wanted us to live in the bonds of holy matrimony. ED BRUNET: Your honor, there's no proof of that at all. In fact to the contrary, we have filed 17 affidavits with the court all swearing that Mr. Vieira not only never married Miss Wells, but clearly had no intentions of ever, ever doing so. That is not true. He loved me. JUDGE: Address your comments to the bench, Miss Wells. Your honor, he must've gotten down on his knees 1,000 times and begged me to marry him before I gave in. And now he's gone. ED BRUNET: Your honor, in addition to being gone Mr. Vieira left an estate worth a great deal of money, including a collection of art appraised at millions of dollars, all of which Miss Wells seeks to inherit under the interstate statute of Louisiana. How dare you? This isn't about the money. Yes, but Mr. Brunet makes a point. Why claim to be the wife of the deceased if not to inherit his estate? For Robert's sake. All right. I've heard enough. Miss Wells, I'm denying your claim to spousal inheritance. Robert Vieira's last will shall stand as written, and will be divided equally, in equal parts, to his surviving heirs. But Your Honor. JUDGE: Case dismissed. DAVID (VOICEOVER): I could see it clearly now. Miranda actually believed her own lies. Harding's visit had gotten to me, so I decided to go back to the beginning. Hey, what are you doing here? Hey. I came to see Carla. Well it's too late. She's gone. What? Nurse came in a couple hours ago to check on her, found the room empty. Did you see her? Do you know where she went? She left a note. CARLA (VOICEOVER): If you want to find the files, listen to the music. Does that mean anything to you? Yeah, it does. Miss Wells needs you to run some errands. ELEONOR: I just talked to her on the phone, she didn't say anything. DAVID: Change of plans. Pick up her dry cleaning and take it to her house. What are you going to do? I got a lot of catch up to do. OK. [music clips playing] [buzz] Shameless. Unbelievable. MIRANDA: Eleonor? Rick? [dialing] [phone ringing] DAVID (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Hi, this is Rick, please leave a message and I'll get back to you. Listen to me. I don't know where you are, I don't know what you are doing, but you are going to have to beg for my mercy. Do you hear me? You're going to have to beg for my mercy. You are my whore, and you will beg for my mercy. [click] Beg for my mercy. I know what I'll do. [phone ringing] MAN (ON PHONE): Si? Ola, Senor. [speaks spanish] Great. Listen, I'm writing an article on Miranda Wells, the lawyer, and it's really important that we speak. Where can we meet? MAN (ON PHONE): Please, I don't want no trouble. Are you still at 149, 37th Avenue? MAN (ON PHONE): Yes, but Senor, por favor... All right, I'll be right over. DAVID (VOICEOVER): It took a long time to get Guerrero to open up. I got home late to find I'd had a visitor. When I saw my laptop was gone, I knew who was behind it. [dialing] [phone ringing] MAN (ON PHONE): Hello? I'm in trouble. Guerrero won't talk if we don't have the disk. And without it, I can't even contact the rest to see if they'd all say the same thing. And you're sure it was her? Who else? She had to have known I took her files. Why? Why? Why what? You said you left her office exactly the way you found it. You returned the original disk back where you found it. So? What if she's just trying to scare you? She breaks into your apartment, steals a bunch of your stuff, including your laptop. And without having any idea there's a disk in the drive. Maybe, but how do we know for sure what she does know? We don't. You're going to disappear for a couple of days. Disappear? Where? I got a little cabin outside of town. It's not much, but it'll do. And what am I supposed to do? Just sit around and wait? I can't do that. Arujo and Vieira didn't have a cabin. Not very much, is it? I took whatever looked valuable, dumped the rest. Like what? Look, you can ask your questions later. Right now, I want my money. What money? I want, I want. Don't you think about anybody but yourself? You're playing games with me? Do not touch me. What are you going to do, huh? I want what I got coming. You wouldn't happen to know the difference between Matisse and a Velvet Elvis, would you? What are you talking about? An art collection worth millions. What the hell's a Matisse look like? BARTENDER: Beats me. Don't even know what that is. It's art work. Million dollar artwork. BARTENDER: What's that got to do with you? Could be I might want to sell some artwork to someone who knows what it's worth. Can I help you, ma'am? You look like you could use some company. Why not? When. I've been looking for you. I... I had a personal problem. I had to get away. How did you find me? You know when you defend criminals for a living, it's pretty easy to find someone. Oh, as a matter of fact, I found the scumbag that burglarized your apartment. Let me guess, one of your clients? Doesn't matter. I have your stuff. All of it? I have your brand new plasma TV, I have your sound system... My laptop? My jacket? All of it. I have it at my house waiting for you. That is if you will apologize. I don't like being walked out on, Rick, especially by someone that I've grown so fond of. I'm sorry. You know, you're going to have to do much better than that. WAITRESS: I'll take that for you. [register bell] You have a good day. DAVID: Hey. You were going to wait for my call. She found me. How? Doesn't matter, I have to go apologize. You have to be crazy. It's the only chance I have of getting the disk back. She has my stuff in her house. It's not worth risking your life. I don't think she wants to kill me, I think she wants my cajones. I'm really close. OK, here's the deal. I'll be parked right outside her house so I can hear if anything starts to go south in there. And what are you going to do? You come in and save me? Come on. There's a couple of cops that I trust, and they're going to just happen to be in the neighborhood. [doorbell] DAVID (ON RADIO): Testing, testing. Can you hear me? DAVID (VOICEOVER): This time I was ready for her. But then I remembered something from an old science class. Well, well, well. DAVID (VOICEOVER): A black widow mates, and then it kills. I've been looking forward to this. What's wrong? I just came to get my stuff. Oh. Excuse me. I didn't know this was the lost and found. Now, repeat after me. I have been a bad boy, Miss Wells. I went away without your permission, I didn't answer my phone or return your calls. I told you. I just came here for my stuff. Now stop playing. MIRANDA (ON RADIO): No, you don't tell me. I tell you. And you are going to listen, or else your Mexican ass is going to wind up a lot further south than the border. You're out of your mind, can't you see? It's over. Get it through your head. What about your green card? There was never going to be a green card. You were going to defraud me, like you defrauded all the others. Just give me my stuff, and I'll go. I just came to get... [static] It's in that cabinet. [dialing] [phone ringing] Don't do this. No! [gunshots] Freeze, drop your weapon! Drop the gun! Get onto there. You see? It isn't over at all. POLICE: You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. - I know that. POLICE: You have the right to speak with an attorney. MIRANDA: I am an attorney. POLICE: You may have an attorney present during questioning. Yeah, dispatch, this is Henry Lon, we need an ambulance for a gunshot victim shot in the leg. I got it. MIRANDA: Oh my God. They pulled him out of retirement? Now come on, please. When this is over you're going to be bigger and better than ever. After all, all you need is a really good attorney. Am I right? I've already talked to the judge. He's likely to set the bail, he said, at $50,000. Which judge? Sandoval. Sandoval. You tell him that that is a bunch of crap. And he better release me on PR, or I will make his life miserable. You tell him that. Miss Miranda, look. You're far too intelligent to think that you can represent yourself in this case. If you're going to hire me as your attorney, you're going to have to do things my way. What makes you think your way is going to work? Well, considering that they found a wounded ex-lover of yours in your house, and you with a smoking gun in your hand, I mean, you can't consider this case a slam dunk. However, if anyone can get you off here, it's me. [buzzer] Here you go. Hey, how's it going? OK, I guess. RON: I understand they're discharging you in a couple of days. I'll glad to be getting out of here. RON: You lived to testify, which is a pretty major accomplishment given Wells' history of men. I wish you would have fought to get the disk that night. Well, a couple of days the police will release the crime scene. Even then they'll probably keep it as evidence. I think we did the right thing by just keeping you alive. Now we've got her on attempted murder charges. NURSE: Excuse me. It's time for your X-Ray. Listen, I kind of lost my perspective back there for a while, and I just wanted to thank you for sticking with me. The important thing is, we got her. She's going to be behind bars a long, long time. Thank you. Hey, wait a minute. You know you're not supposed to be going in there. I'm just going to get my car. Listen, maybe we can get together and have dinner tonight, eh? Lawyers are such pigs. What? You're fired. I'm representing myself. You know you don't stand a chance. Actually, I never lose. Whoo-ee. Seem to me this is pretty illegal. Crossing a police line, tampering with evidence. Of course, I'm not a lawyer like yourself. - Get out. - Ooh, that's pretty scary. Of course now you don't got a big gun to backup them scary words, do you? I said get out. What do you want? A bunch of money for some paintings and such. I told you, I told you. Yeah, you don't know what I'm talking about. That's right. Well, I got millions of dollars worth of artwork, and I'm willing to sell it to you for half. How am I supposed to come up with that kind of money? You're a smart gal. You'll figure it out. DAVID (VOICEOVER): Perry was right. She did figure it out. [sirens] But as for Perry Henden's career as an art dealer, it was over before it began. What you got? It's weird. White male, early 40s, throat slashed. What's weird about it? He's still got the razor in his hand. Also got his pants around his ankles. Yeah. Any ID on him? The men that found him, one the guys thinks he saw him a couple of weeks ago being booked for a 14-6-5.1. That's a purse snatch. One the guys thinks his name is Perry Henden. POLICE: Run it. TAXI DRIVER: That's it. Watch your step, now. There's no place like home. What do you want? To see you. To burn the image of your face into my mind. Not Rick's face, but David's. David Lopez. Talented but struggling journalist. No. No. - MIRANDA: You were going to expose me, weren't you, Rick? For taking advantage of all those poor, poor wetbacks? Get out of here, Miranda. You never counted on how good it felt in my bed, in my arms. Remember, Rick? David, Rick, David, Rick. I'm warning you. You just never counted on all the pleasure. Did you want it? Did you, Rick? - Stop. MIRANDA: David. You could be Rick, David, you could still have it if you wanted it. Do you? Get out now! I'm calling he police. As you wish. Just remember, I always win. [thump] Ah! MAN: Cover the man. Take a shot. There you go. Heard your lawyer's going to be in court today. Looks like she's in a piece of trouble. And there's nobody there to take the fall for her this time. Maybe you'll get life, that way you can wave at each other across the exercise yard. MR. LANSING: And when you went to her house that night, what did you expect would happen? I expected to have my belongings returned to me. Now, did you believe that Ms. Wells had at least engineered, if not participated in, the burglary of your apartment? Objection, your honor. Mr. Lansing is too good of an attorney to be allowed to lead a witness this way. Overruled. Witness can say what he believes. She had my apartment burglarized to steal the files I had taken from her office. And why did you steal these files from her office? I was investigating a story I was writing for my paper. I was actually undercover. Excuse me, but I must object again. Based on what? Lack of foundation. That's enough. You'll both direct your objections to the bench. That's fine with me, Your Honor. Mr. Lansing, you may continue. What was the nature of the story you were writing? Miss Wells had been suspected for years of defrauding money from illegal immigrants. The files I took contained scores of cases where she took their money, charging thousands of dollars, but never produced even a single green card. [murmuring] I have no further questions. Ms. Wells? Thank you, Your Honor. Would you state your name for the record, please? I already stated my name for the record. David Lopez. David Lopez. And did you fill out this employment application to work in my office? Yes. And what name did you fill in? Rick Mendez. Rick Mendez. So then you lied. If you want to call it that. Oh, yes, I think I do. Now while you were working in my office, did we have a sexual relationship? Yes. And while you were working in my office, how much money did you make? I don't know. Three, 4,000. Several grand. And that was because you were such a good secretary? Whatever I got, I had to work for. But didn't you just tell Mr. Lansing that you were really working for you? That you were researching a story for the newspaper? Objection. Argumentative. Ronald, I thought we had an understanding. Order. I'm not going to tolerate this again. Continue. But you took the money. I didn't feel good about it. But you did take it. I guess so. On the night of the shooting, the truth is, is that you came to my house to make love to me, isn't it? No. Well, which is it that you wanted Rick, David. Money or sex? Neither. So on the night of the shooting why did you come to my house? I came for the disk. But if I knew that I had the disk, do you think that I would have given it back to you? Probably not. So then why did you come? Because you didn't know you had the disk, and I thought I had a chance to get it back. But if that was the case, why didn't you just send your good friend Mitch Harding instead? You wanted me to apologize. Oh, so you came to apologize. No. OK so then you came to make love to me. I didn't say that. Oh, that's right, you came for the disk. That's right. The disk that I didn't know I had. No... no, wait it was... you didn't know it was in my laptop. Well then why didn't I just give you the laptop, if I didn't know that the disk was in it? That was... you're turning all this around. How? You wanted me to grovel. You wanted me to beg. You wanted to have sex with me, didn't you? No. MIRANDA: And when I refused you came after me in a murderous rage. That's a lie. The only way that I could stop you was by defending myself, so I shot you. That's a lie. That's a lie. Why should we believe you? You just admitted to pretending to be an illegal immigrant, didn't you? You might as well answer. That's all right, Your Honor. I think it's clear that the witness is a liar and a whore. And I have no further questions. DAVID (VOICEOVER): Rule number three. The job of the journalist is to serve the truth. I went for the truth about Miranda Wells, but in the end truth is what tripped me up. Hey. What do we do now? We might be able to salvage a civil suit. If we can't? Having gotten away with murder, and now attempted murder, does anyone think this isn't going to continue? I don't know. I can't tell what people think anymore. Here she comes. Miss Wells, can we get a statement? MIRANDA: Well, I think it's obvious that I was only acting in self-defense. I presume that the DA, who is a wonderful prosecutor, by the way, will have all charges against me dropped. Well, what will you do now? I'll just have to try and go on from here. Well, you're pretty incredible in there. Thank you. What are you doing now? I'm not sure. How about an exclusive interview. All right. DAVID (VOICEOVER): It was a hell of a story, and a hell of an ending. There are people so good at twisting truth that they manage to slip through the cracks of justice, and go on. So, how does this story end? Miranda said it best. I always win. [music playing]
