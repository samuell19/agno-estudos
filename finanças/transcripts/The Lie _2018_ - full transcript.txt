And they got an emergency call, so they have to take off! [laughs] It's a huge rainstorm. Look, and I'm wearing a dress.

Kayla, your inhaler, it's in the front pocket of your bag. Don't lose it, like you did the last one. I won't. [Greg] Drop me off right here, babe.

Put your seat belt on. -[sighs] -[engine starts] Do I have to go to this stupid retreat, Mom? Why can't I just stay home? Because you want to make principal. And that takes hard work, commitment, sacrifice. I thought you loved ballet. [doorbell buzzing] Can we get breakfast, please? I'm starving. He knows you can't be late this morning. Okay, but I can't dance if I don't eat. I think you should have thought of that before we left the house. Hey! Pikapup. -Can we get something to eat, please? -Ooh! I haven't eaten a thing today. Pancakes. Crazy Custard pancakes? Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Just don't let her be late. Please, Jay. I won't. Pinky swear. You want to join? [Kayla] Oh, yeah, Mom. What are you, a 15-year-old girl? -Come on, Beccs. -[both laugh] You know you love pancakes. -And you know I hate that name. -[door closes] Hey, Kayla. Uh, this is Kayla's mom, Rebecca. Trini plays cello in the band. [Trini] I've heard so much about you, Beccs. -Nice to finally meet you. -Yes. Likewise. Enjoy the pancakes. Mom. What? Forget it. -See you Monday night. -Yeah. -Your mom's got to go to work. -Yeah.

[Kayla] Why didn't you just get a ride with me? 'Cause Sam, my asshole dad, said he would drive and totally lied. Who's that? It's my dad, weirdo.

[water rushing] Kayla, get down from there! Kayla, get down! [Kayla cries out] Kayla, what are you doing? What are you doing? We were, we were-- we were just joking around. -Where's your friend? -I... Where is she? Where's your friend? -Oh, my God. -Wait. Dad. Britney! [Kayla] Daddy! Britney! [Kayla] Daddy! Daddy.

[both breathing heavily] [engine starts] [tires skidding] [speaking indistinctly] I want the depo served as soon as I get those, uh, responses. Can I call you back? Okay. Where's Kayla? [whispering] Um, she's in the car. -Damn it, Jay. Don't tell me... -Listen to me for a second. -...she talked you out of going again. -We need to... -Excuse me. Excuse me. -Listen to me. We need to talk. [Jay] Rebecca. -Goddamn it, hold on. -Should've dropped her off myself. Just hold on a minute. -She needs to be there. -Hey. I'm serious. We have to talk. Talk about what, Jay? She's nothing but a spoiled little brat because you let her get away with everything. Hey, you're right. I'll take her on the retreat. Kayla? [wheezing softly] -I told you to stay in the car. -Jay. I can't-can't breathe. Please. -Where's your inhaler? -I don't know. I put a new one in your bag. I looked in my, in my bag, I can't find it. It's gotta be there. Gotta be there. Come on. Come on. -Let's look. -[coughing] -[Jay] Okay. Okay. I got this. I got this. -Please, no. She just needs to lie down and get some rest. Let's go back to my loft. -Okay? Yes. -No, no. No, Dad. I don't want to, I don't want to go there. Trini's there. I just want to go home. -Come on. No, no, no, no, no. -Come on. Step over. -I'm bringing her to the house. -No. -For God's sakes, Jay. -[Kayla groaning] [Kayla] Dad? Do you think she's pretty? [phone vibrating and ringing] It's the ballet school. Tell them she's sick. Hi. Yes, I know. Lindsey, I'm sorry... I really appreciate your understanding. Okay, bye. -What did you tell them? -What do you think I told them? If you need to get back, I can stay with her. No, it's fine. I can work from home. What happened to your hand? Uh, was cutting drywall. Maybe I should take her back to my place. -It's closer to Gresham. -No, I'm gonna drop her off tomorrow. And you need to make sure that you always have an inhaler with you at all times, in your car. She could get in serious trouble without it. What? [chuckles] [sighs] Kayla? -[Jay] Kayla? -[knocking on door] -What are you doing? -Taking a bath. -Do you mind? -Hey, hey, hey, hey. -Excuse us. -Hey-- I just need to talk... -I'll be right outside. -Jay. [faucet squeaking] What's going on? I do not know what is going on with you two, but you're going to that retreat tomorrow. [exhales] What is this? Kayla, I just bought this. You've got to learn to take better care of your things. You're not a child anymore. Stop it. How did this happen? [breath trembles] [wind whooshing] [wind chimes tinkling] We need a lawyer, a good one. That defense attorney that you argued the Walker case against. He's the best. What's his name? Edelman, Edelstein? I don't, I don't understand how this could happen. I mean, you shouldn't have left. You shouldn't have just driven away. What was I supposed to do? Call the cops? You know better than that. Come on. [slaps table] Think. We need a lawyer, someone to help her. But then, what? I mean, they're not gonna plea this out. Helmes is a law-and-order type. He's the city prosecutor. He'll make an example of her. He-- I mean, he'll try her as an adult. As an adult? That's ridiculous. She's 15 years old. But they were arguing before it happened. So he'll say that it was intentional, with malice. That's second-degree murder. But it wasn't intentional. It was an accident. Jay, she pushed her. -Where are you going? -Going to the river. -I'm going to find her. -No. No, that's not gonna happen. -Sit down. -I have to find her, and then this all goes away. And she could be alive, Jay. She could be alive. -She could be alive in that... -No, no, no, no. She's dead. She's dead. -[whimpering] -[drops keys] Hey, hey, hey. The fall would've broken her neck. Okay? And even if somehow she survived...she drowned. Hypothermia would kill her. Get out. Whatever you want to believe, I know my daughter. She didn't, she didn't mean it. She can't have her life ruined. All right? Look at me. Look at me. There's nothing that we can do for that girl. We have to help Kayla. Okay? No one saw us. No one knows that she was there. So we don't tell anyone. [quietly] God. I need to know that you're on board with this, please. Please go. [door opens and closes] [wind chimes tinkling] -[clicking] -[gas whooshes] [wind chimes continue tinkling] [wind whistling] [dramatic theme playing] [screams] [breathing raggedly] [Kayla] Hey, Mom? What is there to eat? Do you want me to make eggs? Sure. [grunts softly] Thanks. [eggs cracking] [Kayla sniffles] [doorbell rings] Must be your dad. -[door opens] -[Kayla] Hey, Dad. [Kayla] We're making breakfast. Have you eaten yet? Hey, Mom, Dad hasn't eaten breakfast yet. [Rebecca] He's welcome to eat with us. [Kayla] I'm gonna make eggs with jalapeños...and Gouda. My favorite. Okay. [whisk scraping] She seems okay. That's good. -How can she act so normal? -She's in shock. How do you expect her to act? Hmm? [whispers] I don't know. You're sure, you are positive, that nobody saw you? We were in the middle of nowhere. There was... There was no one around. What? It isn't an issue, it's just... there was a truck on the road, -but he didn't see us. -Oh, my God. No-no. He was speeding, okay? He wasn't paying attention. He didn't see her, because we were hiding behind the car. -Jay, he saw the fucking car? -Listen to me. Kayla was never there. Okay? She got sick at my house, and I went to the office to get the inhaler, and then we brought her back here. End of story. Right, we just go on with our lives? Yeah, that's exactly what we do. Because we're not turning her in. That's your daughter. -I know that. -Act like it. It was her she was talking about yesterday, when she said you thought she was pretty? -That was Britney, wasn't it? -Oh, my God. Is that why they were fighting? -'Cause of you? -[mutters] Don't you walk away from me, Jay. Why were they fighting? You answer me. She didn't do it on purpose. Is that what you think? -That she meant to hurt her? -[Rebecca] I don't know. I don't know what I think anymore. [Jay] Just always the absolute fucking worst about your own daughter. [glass shatters] Kayla? Kayla? Kayla. [Rebecca] Jay, where is she going? -Kayla! -Kayla? What-- What are you doing? -This way. Come on. -No! No! No! I hate you! [screaming] Jay, get her inside! Stop her, Jay! [screaming continues] -Please get her inside! -[screaming] Let go! -[Rebecca] Stop it! -It wasn't an accident! I did it on purpose! I pushed her because of you! I fucking did it because of you! Shut up! You shut up! Shut up! [yells] Jay! Jay! [panting] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -I'm sorry. -She didn't mean it. Don't leave. Jay! Jay, don't go! [Kayla wailing] -Are you okay? -Yeah.

Bet they thought they were gonna get away with this, huh? Excuse me? I thought you knew. Britney and Kayla, they didn't make it to the dance camp. Didn't the school call you? Uh, no. Kayla's sick. I kept her home this weekend. Huh. I was sure they were... doing this thing together. You know how they are -with their plans and secrets and stuff. -Yes. [exhales] I did something stupid, you know? I... I told her to take the bus up there. We were fighting, and... she tried to run out of the house, I grabbed her. -She fell. -Oh. Oh, it was just awful. I guess she was punishing old Dad, right? Yeah. Don't worry, Sam. I'm sure she's just playing hooky -or something. -Yeah? -[quietly] Yeah. -Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, you're right. I mean, it's not like she hasn't done this before, right? -Yeah. -A lot? Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to have bothered you about it. -No, no problem. -I-I hope Kayla feels better. Bye. Oh. Actually, um... do you think I could talk to Kayla for a second? You said she was home, right? Um, she went out. Her dad took her to the doctor. Okay. Uh, can she call me when she's back? -I don't want to impose. -No. Of course. Uh, she'll call you. I have your number. Okay. Let me give you my-my work cell. Just in case. Sure. -Um, what is it? -Um... Jesus. [chuckles] It's really cold out here, right? -Yeah, sorry. -Here, let me do that. So three more years and, uh, they're off to college, right? I can't wait. There you go. Okay. Thanks, and, uh, I hope she feels better. [sobbing] Oh, my God. [sobbing continues] [dramatic theme playing] [clock ticking] [Rebecca] Jay? Where are you? I've been calling you all morning. Her dad came by the house, and he wants to talk to Kayla. Call me when you get this, please. Fuck. [phone vibrating and ringing] [sighs] [ringing stops] [water running] [phone vibrating and ringing] [water turns off] [vibrating and ringing continue] [whimpering softly] [gasps] [ringing stops] [TV: man] No, we're not doing a song about a centipede!

Tell him that you don't know where she is. That you've been sick, and that's why you missed the retreat. Here. Call him. [man] I found her in the ocean. The only thing in my veins is my blood! Some other guy's blood, and the gal... Kayla, you need to do this. You cannot prove it was gasoline. [volume increases] Tell me you're not -doing the centipede song... -Stop it. -Georgia! -[TV turns off] You call him right now. No. [doorbell rings] Shh.

Daddy, we're right here. Whoa-- Oh. What's going on? He's an engineer. He's divorced. His wife left him. They moved here, like, three months ago, or two, maybe. You know, at first it was really nice. She had a friend finally, and they were going out, -and she was happy... -He-he-he said that he fought with Britney? What about? I don't know. He didn't say. Kayla started missing curfews and talking back to me -from the minute... -We have to focus on him. What did they fight about? I don't know. Why didn't you call me back all morning? My phone got shot in the river. I had to get a new one. You cannot just walk out of here and leave me to deal with this... by myself. She wants to get caught. [Jay] She's upset. And she's scared shitless to talk to him. And to lie. She's not that kind of kid. We're asking her to lie for the rest of her life, Jay. Okay, this is what we're gonna do: We're putting her -in a hotel for a couple of days. -What? Just to get distance from this. And then we're gonna walk her through the whole story, and when she's calmer, then she can talk to him. Right? You saw her this morning. She can't be trusted to talk to him. Or anyone right now. So I'll pack up her things. You throw whatever you need into my car. We got to go. Now. [car door opens] [car door closes] Rebecca? What's going on? Didn't you get my messages? I've been calling you all morning. No, I'm so sorry. I didn't. Is Kayla back now? I really need to talk to her. No. She's still out at the doctor. Oh, uh, are you okay? -You look really on edge. -[door opens] -Uh... -Hey, can I help you? -This is Britney's dad. -Uh... And this is Kayla's father, Jay. -[Sam] Oh. Hey. Uh... -How you doing? Sam Ismali. Oh, you-you took Kayla to the doctor. So then-- So she's there now, by herself? Running tests. So we'll call you when she gets back. Okay. What the hell's going on? [Jay] Get in the house. -[Sam] What is this? -She's not feeling well. Why are you guys covering up for these girls? What'd they do? -Look, uh-- You need to leave. -[Sam] What'd they do? -I'm sorry, but you need to leave. Yes. -[Sam] I need to... -I got to-- Hey, Kayla. -Yes. -You gotta go. Hey. -Kayla, where's Britney? -Kayla, where-where is... -You gotta go. -Get off me! Shit. -[Kayla] Dad! -Jay. -The hell are you doing? -You're bleeding. -Why are you grabbing me like that, man? -Get out of here! Go! -I didn't mean to hit him. He's acting crazy! Get in the house. [Sam] I just need to know where my kid is, okay? I'm going to the police. Get in the house. [grunts softly] Hang on. -Ah! Ah... -Don't move. Ow! Fuck. [both laugh] Britney had a bruise on her face. I saw it. It was right here. It's like she had been hit. They were fighting that morning. He said so himself. No. No way. -We are not doing that. -Well, he's at the station right now giving his own version of events, so... -I will not be a party to that. -Listen to me, they're gonna arrest her, they're gonna put her away, so we need to do something. I know Sam. He's not like that. You used to work there. Talk to your friend. -That cop. -No. [Jay] Life for one family's over. -It doesn't have to be for ours. -So we frame an innocent man? Sh-- Look, she had a bruise on her face. How many times did he hit her? -No. That's not... -You worked homicide. People do all kinds of crazy things. They hurt their chil-- They kill their children. No. They're coming for her unless we do something. -[door opens] -[indistinct radio chatter] [keys jangle] [Kenji] Becca? [laughs] Damn. They said it was you, and I said “bullshit.” Back from the dead. Or c-corporate law. Same thing. -[chuckles] -How's civilian life treating you? Really good. Yeah. Better than here. I get free coffee where I work now. -Living the dream. -Mm-hmm. You want to talk in my office? No, that's okay. You know, it's-it's probably nothing. But you're here. So, what's up? It's Kayla's friend. She, um, didn't show up to this big retreat that the ballet school hosts every winter over the long weekend. So I'm just worried. So we're talking a teenager who's been AWOL for what? Twenty-four hours, give or take. Her folks file a missing persons? I don't know. But her father came by the house earlier today, acting strange, off. He scared me. I think... ...I think that he abuses his daughter. [dramatic theme playing] [door closes] Mind if I join? I don't care. Want to go for a swim? That was a stupid thing to say. I'm scared. [wind chimes tinkling] You know? It isn't a game, it's your life. It's your future. And it won't always be like this, but for now, you have to do everything we say. It's the only way we can protect you. Yeah. You must be freezing. Here. Here. [sniffles] It helps... It helps take away the pain. [sniffles] No one likes me. None of the boys at school even look at me. No, that's not true. You're beautiful. Not like her. Is that why you pushed her? If you do something really bad... how do you undo that? -[door opens] -[Rebecca] Jay? Kayla, get in the house. I need to talk to your dad. Here you go. Come here. Kenji's gonna be here soon. She wants to talk to Kayla. Tell me about the bruise. Um, i-it was, it was on her jaw. It was right-right here. Did Britney tell you who hit her? No. I realize you may not want to get anyone in trouble, but if she did tell you, I need to know. She didn't. I already said that. Okay. Got it. Understood. When did you and Britney last talk? Uh, um, like, like two-two or three days ago. I-I... I don't really remember. Britney lives just a few streets down, so the girls see each other, like, almost every day. So maybe the day before yesterday? Yeah. Maybe. And you didn't go to this ballet retreat yesterday? Yeah, um, I, um... I got sick at my dad's place, and then I needed my inhaler, so we went to my mom's office, and then we just came back here. Did Britney ever talk about her relationship with her father? Anything helps. He got mad at her... a lot, like, all the time. He's got a really, really bad temper. Um... She told me that he hits her. A lot. Can I go? [Rebecca] She's been sick. Yeah. I-I got enough for now. I'll call if there's anything else. Thank you for coming by. [laughs softly] She's so grown up. Last time I saw Kayla, she was this tall. Yeah. If you need anything else, give me a call. Anytime. -Sorry for putting her through that. -Oh, it's okay. Dad didn't file a missing persons. I checked. What are you gonna do? Well, I'm gonna reach out to that piece of shit, and see what he has to say for himself. Speaking of pieces of shit, how's Jay? -[chuckles] Oh... -I thought he would disappear into his midlife crisis after the divorce. Yeah. He's a-actually, he's changed a lot. He's really good with Kayla. No, he's better than me. He's a good dad. Still downtown, kicking it with the vermin? [chuckles] Well, some things don't change. Thank you for coming by. We should have lunch sometime or-or even dinner. Yeah, if you pay. You're the only one who can afford it. [chuckles] -Bye. -Bye. [water running] [spits] -Hey. -[water turns off] What you said about Britney's dad... Does he really hit her? [Jay scoffs] Wow. Guess I learned from the best. Will you please stay? What if he comes back? I'll talk to your mom. Okay. It's really nice to have you home. Yeah, it is. You know where the extra blankets are, in case you get cold. I'll do it. I got it. [sighs] You didn't change the locks on the door. No, I didn't. How long has she been cutting herself? Um, she started a few months after you left. I had her talk to somebody, but she didn't stop, so... I don't know what to do. I wasn't paying attention. Hey, hey. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry that I wasn't there all those years. Jay, there's something wrong with her. She was such a happy little girl. Yeah, she was. -Good night. -Night. [birds squawking] [car alarm chirps] [Kenji] Mr. Ismali? Detectives Tagata, Barnes. We're with the prosecutor's office. [Barnes] You've been out all night. We've been, uh, waiting for you. Yeah, I-I was, I was looking for my daughter. Did you find her? -Might've helped if you filed a report. -I tried. They didn't take it seriously. They said 'cause she's done this kind of thing before, -I had to wait 48 hours. -Your daughter ran away before? She's not a runaway, she's a teenager: They do this kind of thing. What're you, uh-- You Indian? Arab? What? -Pakistani. -[Barnes] Oh. You ever lose your temper with your kid? What are you asking exactly? [Kenji] Have you ever hit your daughter? -What? -It's a simple yes or no answer. No. No. I never hit my child. Who told you this? -Let's go inside and have a talk. -No! This is bullshit. -Who have you been talking to? -Hey, hey. I heard you. I don't think you fucking did. -What did you say? -[Kenji] Let's go inside, Mr. Ismali. -[gasping] -[laughing] Dad, it's me. Come on, wake up. [sighs] [grunts] Wake up. [exhales] What're we gonna do today? -Hey, hey, stop. -What're we gonna do? [squealing] No, Dad! -No! [shrieks] -[grunts] -What're we gonna do? -I don't know! I asked you. -You're gonna hug me. -Ah! No! [both laughing] -[Jay] Stop. -[Kayla] No. No, you stop. [Jay] Get her off of me! -Ah! Get her off of me. -[laughing] -[laughing] Get her off of me! -Um, I... I have to go into the office for a few hours. Um, feel free to stay, but, um, might be nice to get some fresh air. No, we'll go to my place. I have to change anyway. Say goodbye to your mom. Go on. -Bye. -Bye. Knock 'em out, knockout. Don't break anything. [door opens and closes] No, no, you already got me. Ow! -[both laughing] -[chattering] -I thought I hurt you. -Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. [laughing] What're you doing here? Hi to you too. Uh, band practice? You told us to be here by noon or you'd -fucking fire all of us. -[guitar strumming] Seriously? You forgot? I just got caught up -in stuff and... -Can we talk for a minute? In private? This gig is only, like, the most important thing to us. I don't know how you could've forgot about it. -I've just been dealing with a lot of shit, okay? -What shit? Can we just go back out there? The band's waiting. I found this in your car. Whose is it? It's Kayla's. -Can I have it, please? -Bullshit. -You know what? I'll just go ask Kayla myself. -Hey! Give me the fucking purse right now. I'm not gonna say it again. Give it to me. Asshole. [door opens and closes] [chattering] Hey. Where's Kayla? -She took off too. -What? -What's with your ladies, bro? -[both chuckle] Oh... [Kenji] Becca. -Hey. -[Rebecca] Kenji. Hi. -My partner, Rodney Barnes. -Hey. -Everything okay? -[Kenji] We had a talk with Dad. He was pretty upset, -said you wouldn't let Kayla speak with him. -Yeah. He was acting really crazy, I told you. I didn't want him near her. We know that he has a temper. According to your kid, right? I mean, none of the other neighbors really held the same opinion, but... Maybe they don't know him as well as they think. Did your daughter ever mention Britney Ismali losing her cell phone? No. Did you bring him in at least? Kayla gave you plenty to hold him for 24 hours, keep the pressure on. [Barnes] We think the missing girl must've lost her cell 'cause the last ding that we got was the day after she disappeared, and we traced it to a cell tower downtown. Your husband lives downtown, right? My ex-husband. Right. And how does he, uh, get along with your daughter's friends? Like any father would. What are you implying? [Barnes] I'm not implying anything. I'm just, uh, I'm just wondering. Girl... Girl was pretty hot. [Rebecca] Did this guy just get off prison detail? I'd send him back there if I was you, Kenji. Teach him some manners. Just doing the job. You know how it goes. Yes, I do. And I need to do mine, so if there isn't anything else... Nothing else. Thanks, Rebecca. Happy to help anytime. -[tires screech] -[car door opens] Kayla! Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. This has gone far enough, all right? The police are involved now, do you know that? So whatever this game is that you and Britney are playing, it's over, it's done. You gotta tell me where she is. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I never... I never meant for-for it to go this far. I never meant for anyone to g-get hurt. -What does that mean? -N-nothing. -What does that mean, Kayla? -[gasps] -Let me go! Let me go! -Where is my daughter? -[screams] -My daughter! Jesus! [panting] [tires screeching] [gasps] [suspenseful theme playing] [engine revving] [panting] -[lock clicks] -[doorbell rings] [doorbell rings] [Kayla panting] [Kayla breathing raggedly] [exhales sharply] [wheezing] [suspenseful theme playing] [pounding] Kayla! Kayla! Kayla! [tires screeching] Jay? Kayla? Kayla? Honey? -What? -[door opens] -What are you doing? -[door closes] [Jay] Kayla? Kayla, what were you thinking? Why did you just leave? Kenji came by my office. They tracked down Britney's phone: It was downtown. -Oh, my God. Do you have it? -No, I left it in my car. It was turned off. They won't be able to trace it again. [Rebecca] That doesn't matter. They know where it was. They know you live there. [Jay] But so does half the fucking city. When'd you talk to them? You should've called. -I'm supposed to call you... -Yeah! ...right after the cops talked to me? How's that gonna look? You have to fucking think, Jay! I can't be the only one thinking! What do you want from me? I made one mistake! But we can't make any mistakes, Jay! [crying] Shut up! Shut up. It's my fault, all of it! It just won't stop. Kayla, stop it. -Just stop it. -I'm a terrible person. [sobbing] I'm a terrible person. What I did... I'm a-- I'm a-- I'm a terrible person. -I'm a terrible person. -No. -No, no, you're not. -Yes, I am. Listen. You are a good person. I know that. -[crying continues] -So that thing that happened, it was an accident. You didn't mean it. And we are never gonna talk about that thing again. Ever. Okay? -Okay? -Okay. [Rebecca] Shh... -This is it. -[engine turns off] [wind whistling] [window rolls down] Okay, now you've seen it. You happy? Give me a minute. She's a three-time runner. A year and a half ago, six months ago. Kids don't run without a reason. Maybe your buddy was right, huh? Come on, Kenji, I thought you liked Dad for it. I do. Okay, then what are we doing here? [train horn blows in distance] Let's bring him in and have another talk. [water rushing nearby] [train horn blows in distance] [soft tapping] [tapping continues] [dramatic theme playing] [doorbell rings] [Barnes] You familiar with the Hopewell Bridge? It's, uh, on Route 275, just on the way to Gresham. You can't miss it from the road. No, I'm not familiar with it. So you didn't stop there that morning with Kayla? [scoffs] We went straight from my house to Rebecca's office, just like I told you, no stops. You should be talking to the father again, arresting him already. You're keeping eyes on him, at least? Let's get back to this. This is a waste of time. I mean, he could flee. He could be off to Chicago, or wherever he's from. Did Kayla and Britney fight recently? No. Never? Wow, really? They never fought? -I didn't say that they never fought. -Okay, so when was the last time that they did fight? You want to give her a chance to speak, or are you just gonna keep interrupting? They're best friends. Of course they fought. Nothing recent. We found some e-mails on Britney's computer about a boy, Jeremy Richards. Do you know him? No. He's a kid at school. So what? He was your daughter's boyfriend. -What? -[Barnes] A few weeks ago, she accused Britney of stealing him. She wrote kind of a nasty e-mail too. I got it right here. Yeah. [clicks tongue] She threatened to kill Britney. -Look, we know teenagers can be melodramatic. -[laughs] -She obviously didn't mean it. -Are you serious? [laughs] That's ridiculous. I'm gonna ask you one more time, and I need you to be straight with me. Was Kayla at, or in the vicinity of, the Hopewell Bridge that morning? No. [sighs] We found this there. Kayla's inhaler. [Barnes] The canine unit is searching the river right now. It's only a matter of time until they find her. Get out. Get out of my house. -Come on, Becca. -I need you to leave right now. [door opens] They're gonna come back. They're gonna arrest her. They're gonna arrest all of us. [dramatic theme playing] [engine turns off] [wind whistling] [twig snaps] [exhales sharply] [dog barking in distance] [suspenseful theme playing] [phone vibrates] Jay, he's in the house. The lights went out. [quietly] He must be going upstairs. Can you see the top floor from there? No, I-I mean, I can't see the back from here. Hold on. Jay, he's not turning any lights on. I don't know where he is. I think we just need to get out of here. Okay. Almost done. Oh, God, I think we need to go. Are you there? [dog barking in distance] [beeping] [twig snaps] [panting] No, no. You're not going anywhere. You tell me where Britney is. Where's my daughter? [Rebecca] Jay! [screaming, grunting in distance] -Let go of me! -Just tell me... -Hey! What are you doing? -[screams] What... Jay! -Jay! -[Sam] Hey, what the hell? Don't you fucking touch her. -[water splashing] -[Sam struggling] Jay! [panting] -Stop. Stop it! -[Sam] Please. Jay. Jay, stop it. You're killing him. -[shouting] -[panting] Okay. Stop it! [Sam gasping, coughing] [gasping continues] I know... [coughs] I know you've been protecting her. I know Kayla's the one... I know she did it! -Jay. -I know. Hey, let's go. Let's go. Let's go, now. Go! [engine starts] [tires screeching] [pedal thuds] Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! -Hey! -[body splats] [both panting] [high-pitched ringing] [muffled] Rebecca! Go grab help, Go, go! Oh, God. [exhales] Rebecca. Help. -[high-pitched ringing stops] -What are you doing? [Sam, crying] Please... Please! Help me. Please... Please. [sniffles] [dramatic theme playing] [exhales] Please don't leave me. [whimpers] [Jay] I won't. [Rebecca sighs] [silverware clattering in distance] [toaster clicks] [whisk scraping] [sizzling] [blinds rattling] [Kayla] Here you go. Aren't you guys hungry? [silverware clinking] [Rebecca crying] [Kayla] Um, I'm gonna be late. I love you guys. [dramatic theme playing] [water sloshes] [knocking on door] [door opens and closes] [Britney] Is Kayla home? Mrs. Marston, is everything okay? [exhales] I guess Kayla told you. Okay, we totally didn't mean for it to go on this long, but... I just, I just wanted to see my boyfriend. And Kayla... [Britney chuckles softly] ...she just, just kind of went along with it. [chuckles] [exhales] Does my dad know? Am I in trouble? I'm... I'm gonna go say hi to her. Wait. [Britney shudders] Go home. [door opens and closes] [footsteps receding] [wind whooshing] [wind whooshing continues] What? Don't look at me like that. It was, uh-- B-Britney planned-planned all of it. N-not me. She-she said it would be funny if-if I pretended to push her. Kayla, my God. I was-- I was gonna tell you. I was. I swear, I was. I was, I was gonna tell you, I... I-I swear. I swear I was. I-I... But then... But then, I... I heard both of you in the bathroom... and you were laughing. It was just like, you know, before. It was like that, when I was, when I was little. It was like that. And we were so happy. [crying, stammering] I just, I-I needed some more time. That's all, I just needed some more time. You know? I just needed time for you, for you to choose each other. Really, just... for you to choose me. I'm... I'm sorry. Please, no... I'm sorry. Please, please, no. I'm sorry. Please don't leave me. I just wanted it to be like it was before. I'm sorry. Please don't leave. I'm sorry. Please don't leave me, Mom. Please... I can't... I love you. Please don't leave me.
