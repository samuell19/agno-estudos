One day, little girl The sadness will leave your face As soon as you've won Your fight to get justice done Some days, little girl You'll wonder what life's about But others have known Few battles are won alone So you look around to find Someone who's kind Someone who is fearless like you The pain of it will ease a bit When you find a man with true grit One day you will rise And you won't believe your eyes You'll wake up and see A world that is fine and free Though summer seems far Away You'll find the sun One day Little Frank... you take care of your mama. l will. You're not traveling very heavy, Tom. I got all I need. [Baby Cries] You should be taking the train, Frank. Fort Smith is too long a ride. On Judy 70 miles will be just a pleasant outing. Yarnell, I know you'll take good care of the place for me, you and my Mattie. Where is Mattie? I'm in here, Papa. Well, little bookkeeper, you got my wherewithal ready? Of course. How much are you allowing me? There's right around... $150 cash money. Uh-huh. You better hand me my good luck gold pieces, too. Buying Texas mustang ponies, You'll need more luck than they put in at the mint. You'll come around to my plan. I intend to buy as many ponies as I can swing. we'll breed them for deer hunting. I don't think much of Texas ponies. They're small and chicken-brained. I'd say small and tough, just right for keeping up with dogs through the brush. You want my advice, Papa? I always do. Buy the ponies cheap. I expect to. This Colonel Stonehill, he's got to get rid of them before winter sets in. Papa, that gun's old-fashioned. Buy a new one at Fort Smith. It served me Well at Chickamauga. It's got a long way to go yet. [Mattie] Goodbye, Papa. Tom Chaney-- there's trash for you. should have stayed and looked after the place. It's his job. Papa took him in when he was starving, gave him a house. Come, Mattie. It's only an old toolshed. You can still throw a cat through the south wall. It's got a good roof. This game's crooked. What do you mean? You've been dealing me seconds! God damn crooks! You've been stacking the decks! Oh, come on, Tom. We got our business done. We want to make an early start for home. Them card sharps was cheating me. I'm getting my money back. Not full of whiskey and with a gun. A gun says a whole lot. You work for me. I won't allow it. Give me your gun. I'll give you one end! Give me that gun. Give me your gun. all aboard! Can you tell me where the undertaker is? Around the corner from the courthouse. Thank you. [Train Whistle Blows] Can't understand all these people being here. Man on the train told me everybody coming here. I'd like to know why. They're hanging three men today at the courthouse. We'd better go and see about Papa. Man out rustling up business for hisself, looks like. Well, seem like we have us a lot of time to waste before we see anybody much. I can tell you want to go to that hanging. Afraid I can't. Your mama said keep an eye on you. Well, I'll go along. Don't worry, I won't tell Mama. [Crowd Singing] A wretch like me I once was lost But now am found Was blind, but now I see 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear Warm peanuts! Fresh! And grace my fears relieved How sweet the sound That man up there on the porch... How precious did That grace appear That's Judge Parker. He watches all the hangings. He says it's his sense of duty. Who knows what's in a man's heart? The hour I first believed Amen The hangman's a Yankee. They say he won't spring the trap on a boy that wore the blue. No. I'm here. I'll--I'll see it all. [Crowd Screams] My goodness. [Horse Whinnies] That's not a fainthearted judge. Chaney would get his due before such a judge. ls that the man? That is my father. If you would like to kiss him, it will be all right. No. Put the lid on it. I'm Mattie Ross of near Dardanelle in Yell County, and this is my friend Yarnell Poindexter. He works on our place. Yes, ma'am. State your business. My father was killed in Fort Smith by a coward named Tom Chaney. I'm here to find out what you're doing about the murderer. Well, we do know this much-- his name's Chambers, he's now in Indian territory. We think he was with Lucky Ned Pepper robbing a mail hack Tuesday down on the Poteau River. He's medium height with a black mark on his cheek. That's a description of Tom Chaney. There's no "Chambers" to it. He got that black mark when a man fired a pistol in his face and the powder got under the skin. Why aren't you out looking for him? I have no authority in the Indian nation. He's now the business of the U.S. Marshal. Who's the best Marshal they have? Bill Waters is the best tracker. The meanest one is Rooster Cogburn-- a pitiless man, double tough. Fear don't enter into his thinking. L.T. Quinn is the straightest. He brings prisoners in alive. Where would I find this Rooster? The federal court this afternoon. He's bringing in a load of prisoners from the territory. ls Chaney one of them? I don't know. That's federal business. Uh, your father's gun. You'll want to take it home, I expect. His saddle is at Colonel Stonehill's stock barn, and the rest of his things are at the Mornock boardinghouse. I won't rest until Tom Chaney's barking in hell. Yarnell... You stay with Papa. When you get him home, put him in a better coffin and bury him in Mason's apron. Your Mama won't like you not coming with me. I can take care of myself. Tell her not to sign anything till I get back. People will take it wrong that I lleave this to you, Yarnell, but l got Papa's business to attend to. Tell Mama I'm staying at the Mornock boardinghouse and I'm going to see if Tom Chaney's one of the prisoners brought in, and then I'll see this Rooster Cogburn. all right, get out of the way. Back up. Back up. Stand up. Come on out. Move along! Are those the prisoners from the Indian territory? Yes, ma'am. ls one of them Tom Chaney? Cogburn ain't turned in his list yet. Which one is Rooster Cogburn? The big fella with the eye patch. Go on! all right, take it away. Mr. Cogburn! Wait. You come back here! Mr. Cogburn! Mr. Cogburn? I said you come back here! all right... come on up. If Mr. Cogburn thinks I'm put off by a locked door, he does not know me. l will be here when it opens. The best time for you to nail Rooster is tomorrow. He's due to testify before Judge Parker in the Wharton case. Thank you very much. I appreciate your kindness. Have some more dumplings, dear? At the rate of 25 cents per meal, I might just as Well. I was hoping you were enjoying the dumplings. They're all right. Can't see 25 cents in a little flour and grease. You're late, Mr. La Boof. The French is La Boeuf. I call it La Beef. Oh. Mr. La Boeuf came in this evening. Uh, your spurs, please. My poor chairs are scratched enough already. A right fancy rig, sir. Watch out for the chicken and dumplings. They'll hurt your eyes. How's that? They'll hurt your eyes looking for the chicken. You squirrel-headed bastard. Howdy. What's your name? I'd like to go to bed now, but first I'd like to see my father's traps. I'll take a guess and say your name is Mattie Ross. This Mr. La Boeuf is a handsome man. He needs a bath and a shave. Well, he hails from Texas. I judge he's right proud of his cowlick. How do you suppose he guessed my name? He's a good guesser, I guess. We're short of rooms on account of the hanging, but You'll sleep in here with Grandma Turner. Don't you worry about Grandma Turner. She's used to doubling up. I take it my rent will be half, then. This is your father's traps. The watch and the knife are inside. Chaney stole his money and his horse. What is your opinion of a Federal Marshal called Rooster Cogburn? Rooster Cogburn? Lord, I've heard some terrible things about him. He loves to pull a cork, I know that. His Honor Judge Parker. all rise. I'll have a peppermint to settle my stomach. Y-Yes, sir. Right, sir. The United States Court of the Western District having criminal jurisdiction in the Indian territory, is now in session. ls that Judge Parker, the hanging judge? Yeah. He's a tough customer. There's no appeal from his court except to the President of the United States. Call Deputy Marshal Cogburn. Mr. Reuben J. Cogburn will take the stand. You're still sworn in. Take the stand. Defense will cross-examine. Mr. Cogburn, you testified for the prosecution this morning. In order to refresh our memories, allow me to summarize what you said. According to your story, C.C. Wharton grabbed up a shotgun and killed Marshal Potter, then he turned the gun on you, you say, and you shot him. Then, you say, the father swung his ax and you shot him, too. The defendant here tried to run, you say, and you also shot him. Just winged him, or he wouldn't be here to pay up. The old man and C.C. hit the ground dead. How long have you been a deputy marshal, Mr. Cogburn? Four years, come March. How many men have you shot in that time? The prosecution objects! Overruled. How many men have you shot since you became a marshal, Mr. Cogburn? I never shot nobody I didn't have to. That was not the question. How many? Uh... Shot or killed? Oh, let's restrict it to kill so we may have a manageable figure. Well, 12 to 15, stopping men in flight and defending myself. 12 to 15. So many that you cannot keep a specific count. I have examined the records, Mr. Cogburn. A much more accurate figure is available. Come now, how many? Well, counting them two Whartons, 23. I felt you would come to it with a little effort. 23 dead men in 4 years. That makes about six men a year. It's a dangerous business. Oh, how much more dangerous for those arrested by you? ls it not true you sprang upon old man Wharton and his two sons with a deadly six-shot revolver in your hand? I always try to be ready. Was this revolver loaded and cocked? Well, a gun that's unloaded and cocked ain't good for nothing. Just answer my questions, if you please. Well, the question don't make sense. Don't bandy words with counsel, Mr. Cogburn. Yes, sir. You've testified that you backed away from old man Wharton. Yes, sir. Which direction were you going? Backward. I always go backward when I'm backing away. I appreciate the humor of that remark. Aaron Wharton was standing by a pot when you arrived? More like squatting. He was stirring the fire under the scalding pot. How far did you back away? Six, eight steps. Meaning Wharton advanced on you the same distance-- six or eight steps, say about 16 feet? Something like that. Then will you explain why the body was found by the wash pot, one arm in the flames, the sleeve and hand smoldering? Them hogs. They was rooting around. They may have moved the body. Hogs, indeed. Mr. Garley, do you have any more questions for Mr. Cogburn? None that I'll get a straight answer to. I'm finished with him. You are dismissed, Mr. Cogburn. Call the next witness. Cecil Falling Leaf, take the stand. Raise your right hand. Mr. Rooster Cogburn? What is it? I'd like to talk with you a minute. They tell me you're a man with true grit. What do you want? Speak up. You've already wrinkled the paper. It's pretty loose because your makings are too dry. I'm looking for Tom Chaney. Well, who's he? He's the man that shot and killed my father, Frank Ross. He's in the Indian territory. I need somebody to go after him. Well, who are you? Mattie Ross. My family has 480 acres of good bottom land near Dardanelle in Yell County. My mother's home looking after my baby sister and my brother little Frank. Why don't you go home and leave me alone? They'll need help with the churning. Mr. Cogburn! You can get a fugitive warrant for Tom Chaney, and the government will give you $2.00 for bringing him in, plus 10 cents a mile for each of you, and I'll give you $50 reward. You've looked into this. Yes, I have. I mean business. What do you got there in your poke? Why, by God, girl, that's a colt dragoon! You're no bigger than a corn nubbin. What are you doing with all this pistol? It belonged to my father. He carried it bravely in the war. I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it. Well, this'll sure get the job done if you can find a fence post to rest it on while you take aim. I'm afraid nothing will be done about Chaney unless I do it myself. I don't think you got $50. I've got horse trading to do. I'll have it by tomorrow. You know a robber named Lucky Ned Pepper? I know him... Well. I shot him in the lip last August over at Winding Stair Mountains. He was lucky that day, all right. My shooting was off. l think Tom Chaney's tied up with him. Yeah? Yeah. Huh. Ned Pepper, huh? Yeah. Well, baby sister, I don't think you can get $50. But if you're hungry, I'll give you supper. we'll talk it over. Make medicine. How does that suit you? Right down to the ground. I'd like to meet your family. [Bell Rings] This is my father, Chen Lee, and my nephew, General Sterling Price. You want more, Missy? I've had enough, and enough is good as a feast. I've never seen chopsticks work before. Chopsticks save your fingers. Give me your cup. I don't drink coffee, thank you. Well, now, what do you drink? I'm partial to cool buttermilk. We ain't got none of that. We ain't got no lemonade, neither. Let's get to the game. Ahh. My deal? Yes, sir. What about my proposition? I'm thinking on it. Sounds like a mighty easy way to make $50 to me. Don't crowd me. I'm figuring expenses. Don't see how you can play cards, drink whiskey, and think of this detective business all at the same time. If I have to go up against Ned Pepper, it'll cost $100. I figured that much out. And 50 in advance. You're taking advantage of me. I'm giving you my children's rates. It isn't going to be easy smoking old Ned out. He'll be holed up down in that Indian nation. Don't think I'm going to keep you in whiskey. I don't buy that. I confiscate it. A touch of it wouldn't do you any harm against the night air. No, thank you. Well, it's the real article. Genuine double-rectified busthead. Aged in the keg. I would not put a thief in my mouth to steal my brains. Well, Sis, my price is $100. There it is. Want to make medicine? l will think about your proposition. I'm going to the Mornock boardinghouse. Walk me over there. You are a lot of trouble. Wait'll I finish this hand. You can never tell what's in a Chinaman's mind. That's the way he bests you at cards. [Bell Rings] I go. [Squeak Squeak] Scat! Shh. Shh. Mr. Rat. I have a writ here says you're to stop eating Chen Lee's cornmeal forthwith. Now, it's a rat writ writ for a rat, and this is lawful service of same. [Squeak Squeak] Doesn't pay any attention to me. Outside is place for shooting! I'm serving some papers. That was your job in the first place. You can't serve papers on a rat, baby sister. You got to kill him or let him be. What's your thoughts on it? You going to drink all of that? Judge Parker-- old carpetbagger, but he knows his rats. We had a good court going around here till them pettifogging lawyers moved in. A rat catcher's too tough on the rats. Give them rats a fair show, they say. What kind of fair show Did they give old man Potter? Tell me that. Finer man never lived. You're useless in this condition. I'll walk over there by myself. You scared of the dark? I've never been scared of the dark. If I had a horse pistol like that, I wouldn't be scared of no boogerman. I'm not scared of no boogerman. Sugar? No, thanks. Cream? Please. Whoa. Just a dab. Oh, Miss Ross. I've been waiting to have some private words with you. And you, dear lady, I find a sweet distraction, as I suppose most men do. will you excuse us? Why, of course, Mr. La Boeuf. What do you want of me? Who are you? Nobody yet, but I expect to go high. How? Well, to begin with, I expect to marry Well. Well, you have the hair combed for it. How'd you know my name? I saw your mother yesterday. What business did you have with her? This. Can you identify the man in this picture? It's a likeness of Tom Chaney. There's no black mark on his face, but that's him. I'm looking for him. I hear you are, too. I know about your father. Why didn't you show me this last night? I only take one step at a time. That's why I was given two feet. His real name is Therin Chilnsford. He shot and killed a state senator named Bibbs. I've been on his trail four months. You some kind of law? I'm a sergeant in the Texas Rangers. I'm working for Senator Bibbs' family. Chilnsford or Chaney, he shot and killed the senator's bird dog. Bibbs threatened to whip him, and Chaney shot him sitting in a porch swing. Well, you need not worry about Chaney anymore. I aim to have him hanged. The sheriff informed me you were looking for somebody to go after Chaney. I've already found one. His name is Rooster Cogburn. He's a deputy marshal for the federal court, toughest one they have. Maybe I'll throw in with you and your marshal. Talk that over with Rooster Cogburn. It's to our mutual advantage-- He knows the land, and I know Chaney. It's a two-man job to take him alive, and I must have him alive down to Texas. We're not taking Chaney to Texas. we'll take him to Fort Smith and hang him. ls it important where he hangs? It is to me. More so to me. There's a Well-placed young lady in Texas who'd look with favor on me for bringing in Chaney. Wouldn't a Texas hanging serve you just as Well? I want Chaney to pay for killing my father, not for some Texas bird dog. It's not for the dog. It's for the senator, and your father, too. Chaney will be just as dead. If in four months I could not find Chaney with a facial mark like banished Cain, I would not advise others. Earlier, I gave some thought to stealing a kiss from you, although you are very young and unattractive to boot. But now I'm thinking of giving you five good licks with my belt. One would be as unpleasant as the other. Touch me, You'll answer for it. Texans don't understand our ways. People here don't go easy on abusers of women and children. The children of Texans are brought up to show respect for their elders. They also gouge their horses with great brutal spurs and cultivate their hair like lettuce. You'll push that saucy line too far. Mr. La Boeuf, I have no regard for you, but you have enough for yourself to go around. They are all for sale... except those four scrubby ones. And, uh... who do they belong to? The heirs of the late Frank Ross. I'm Mattie Ross. I'd like to sell you those ponies my father bought. That's out of the question. My father bought those ponies for breeding. I've looked at them, and they're all geldings. You cannot breed geldings. That hardly concerns me. Your father bought four ponies, paid $100 for them, and that's it. I want $300 for Papa's saddle horse that was stolen from your barn. Take that up with whoever stole it. It was in your care. You are responsible. Ahem. I admire your sand, but lam not liable. l will take it to the law. Do as you think best. We will see if a widow and three children get fair treatment here. You have no case. Lawyer J. Noble Daggett of Dardanelle in Yell County may think otherwise. You are impudent. I do not wish to be, but l will not be pushed about when I'm right. I'll speak to my attorney. I'll speak with mine-- lawyer Daggett. He will make money, l will make money, your lawyer will make money, and you, Mr. Licensed Auctioneer, you will foot the bill. You are a damn nuisance. Lawyer Daggett? Who is this famous pleader whose name I was happily ignorant of? Ever heard of the great Arkansas River, Vicksburg, and Gulf and Steamship Company? I've done business with the G.A.V. & G., yes. He was the one that forced them into receivership. They tried to mess with him. all right. Come inside. Sit down. l will pay a total of $200 to your father's estate when I have in my hand a letter absolving me of all liability from the beginning of the world to date. I want $200 for Papa's horse Judy, plus another $100 for the ponies. That's $300 total. The ponies aren't part of this. I won't buy them back. Then I'll keep the ponies. The price for Judy alone will be $300. I wouldn't pay that for winged Pegasus. Now, listen very carefully, as l will not bargain further. l will take the ponies back, keep your father's saddle, and settle for $200. My lawyer would not wish me to consider anything under $300. For that, you get everything except the saddle. I would like to have that in writing, for what it is worth. When I have it in my hand, I'll remit the extortion money. Now, this is your release. You'll find it in order. You had that already written out. I'll give you a check. I prefer cash. 100. 200. 300. I'm sure You'll find a buyer for those ponies. I have a tentative offer of $10 a head from the soap works at little Rock. It's a shame to render such spirited horseflesh into soap. I'm confident the deal will fall through. You can expect me back for my saddle. I'm sure I can. Do you know a Marshal Rooster Cogburn? Most people around here have heard of Rooster Cogburn, and some people live to regret it. I would not be surprised to learn that he's a relative of yours. Good morning. Good morning. Where's Rooster Cogburn? Sleep late. Very drunk last night. I've never seen anybody in bed at 10:00 in the morning who wasn't sick. Coffee. You ain't such an early bird yourself, baby sister. I just about give up on you. Figured you'd gone home. You need some more slats in that bed. Trouble is, there's no slats in it at all, except a damn Chinese rope bed torture contraption. I'd like to burn it-- God dang, you got it. How much is there there? You still game? Baby sister, I was born game, and I intend to go out that way. all right. One understanding-- We leave this afternoon to get Tom Chaney. Well, you're not going. You've misjudged me. I can't go up against Ned Pepper's gang and take care of a baby all at the same time. I'm not a baby. You'll slow me down. There's no hot grub or warm beds. Papa took me coon hunting before. This ain't no coon hunt. It's no place for a shirt-tailed kid. They said that about coon hunting. First night out, you'd be calling, "Mama! Mama!" I've left off crying. Make up your mind. If you're not game, I'll find somebody who is. I know you can drink whiskey. I saw you kill a rat. But the rest has been talk. I'm not paying for talk. I ought to paddle your rump. How can you do that from the hog wallow you're sunk into? If I smelled as bad as you, I wouldn't live near people. I've made up a short agreement between us. Sign it. And here's $25. Oh. I'll give you another $25 when we leave, and 50 when the job is done. Well, I guess we can get started at first light. we'll cross the ferry. I want to talk to an informer in the Indian nation. Might know something. I'll be more than ready. Well, General... look what we got. There's an old saw that says, "One white foot buy them, "two white feet try them, "three white feet be on the sly, four white feet pass them by." But I do not hold with that. [Neigh] I just received word that a young girl fell head first into a 50-foot Well on the Towsend Road. I thought perhaps it was you. No, it was not l. What do you hear from the little Rock soap man? Nothing. I'll take one of those ponies off your hands-- the black one with the white stockings. l will call him little Blackie. What is your offer? l will pay the market price. The soap man offered you $10 a head. That is a lot price. You recall I paid you $25 a head only this morning. That was the market price at that time. Tell me this, do you entertain plans of ever leaving this city? Yes. I'm off early tomorrow morning for the Indian nation. Marshal Rooster Cogburn and l are going after the murderer Tom Chaney. Cogburn. How did you light on that greasy vagabond? They say he has grit. I wanted a man with grit. Well, I suppose he has that. He's a notorious thumper. He's not a man I would share a bed with. Nor would l. I wouldn't trust him too much. I have only paid him a token payment. The balance will be paid when the job is done. It may prove to be a hard journey. A good Christian does not flinch from these difficulties. Neither does he rashly court them. The good Christian is not willful or presumptuous. You think I'm wrong? l think you are wrong-headed. l will pay you $12 for that pony... if you shoe him for me. l will not ride a barefoot pony. Good morning. Good morning. Howdy. What are you doing here? I'm having a little conversation with the marshal. Sit down, sis. Have some taffy. This jaybird says he's on the track of the same man we're after, like to throw in with us. I have already told him we're not interested. He's gone behind my back. Well, a fella that carries a big boar sharps carbine might come in handy if we get jumped by elephants or buffalo or something. We don't need him. Got everything ready? all but the grub. I reckon I must have the wrong man. Do you let little girls hurrah you, Cogburn? Would you mind repeating that, jaybird? There's no hurrahing in it. The marshal's working for me. How much she paying you? Enough. ls she paying you $500? No. That's what the Governor of Texas has put up for this man she calls Chaney. $500? Very little for a man who's killed a senator. Bibbs was a little senator. Hmm... Well, I guess I'll just stick with sis. The Bibbs family's put up another $1,500 for Chaney. Have they now. What are the terms? Deliver Chaney. They don't care if he's alive or dead. Ah, that's more to my liking. How you figuring on splitting up the money? If we take him alive, I'll split the $1,500 with you and keep the state reward of $500. If we kill him, I'll give you $500. He wants to take Chaney back to Texas. That's not what I want. You both want him caught and punished. I want Chaney hanged for my father's murder. It's little to me how many dogs he killed. Well, you can tell him to his face, you can spit in his eye, you can make him eat sand, you can shoot him in the foot, but we got to catch him. You got to learn you can't have everything your own way. When I bought something, I'll have it my way. I don't understand this. She ain't going, anyhow. You run along home, your mama wants you. I told her she could go. No. She'll make nothing but trouble. Maybe I'll catch this Chaney by myself and take all the money. You might deliver him, but I'd see to it you didn't collect a thing. How'd you go about that? I'd dispute your claim, muddy up the water. Do that and I'll kill you. I wouldn't count too much on shading somebody I didn't know. I ain't never seen nobody from Texas I couldn't shade. You get crossways of me, and You'll think a thousand of brick have fell on you. You wished you was back at the Alamo with Travis. Knock him down, Rooster. Stay out of this. That reward money's a pig in the poke. I've given you good cash money. Look at him grin, he'll cheat you. Fella's got to think about himself once in a while. we'll get your man, that's the main thing. Give me my $25 back. Hand it over. I spent it. You sorry piece of trash. I'll get it. I'll send it to you. That's a big story. You can't cheat me. You may Well hear from my lawyer Daggett. [Door Opens] [Door Closes] Lawyer Daggett? who's lawyer Daggett? I wouldn't worry about him. I'd worry about our business at hand. Red. Good morning. The river looks kind of high. Yeah. It's been raining upcountry. Who you looking for this time, Marshal? Red, if I was to tell you that, you might tell him. Well, you're Well enough armed. I would say Tom Chaney look out. Can't you get anything through your head? You're not going. Forget about the freight, Paddy, and take us on across. You're not getting on this ferry. This is open to the public. I have paid my 10 cents. Take this girl to the sheriff. She's a runaway, and there's a $50 reward. That's a big story. Ask the marshal. Oh, she's a runaway, all right. Bound to be paper on her. They're in this story together. I've got business across the river. If you interfere, You'll land up in court, which you don't want to be. I've got a good lawyer in J. Noble Daggett. Lawyer Daggett again. She draws him like a gun. l will not walk up that hill. I'm not about to let $50 slide. Get on that horse, then. Wait a minute. l got to fix my hat. Oh! Hey! Come back here! By God! She reminds me of me. Then we might just not get along. Well, you were a little slow getting across. I said you wasn't going. Go back. l will do no such thing. La Boeuf... Right. Those horses can't get away from little Blackie. They're loaded down with fat men and iron. Aah! Now we'll see what tune you sing. Ow! I'm going to raise welts on you. See what good it does you! You're not hurting me! I'm just mad! Are you going to let him do this? I don't believe l will. Drop that switch, La Boeuf. Put it down. You're enjoying it too much. I go ahead with what I start. You do, and it'll be the biggest mistake you ever made, you Texas brush popper. You've taken her part all along, but you ain't doing her no kindness here. Just leave her alone. This has given me a plan. When we locate Chaney, we can jump him, knock him insensible, tie his feet, and take him back alive. What do you think? You wouldn't like to know what l think. Get on your horse. It's not dinnertime by now? Dinnertime will come and go without notice. Get on your horse. [Rooster Crows] Presbyterian, huh? Southern or Cumberland? Southern. My folks are Cumberland. Proud of it. I was raised in an Episcopal church. Figured you for some kind of kneeler. Well, what did you learn? Well, Ned was sighted at Mcallister's store about three days ago. He goes there from time to time to pay attention to a lewd woman. There's an old thief named Hayes with him and a Mexican on a round-bellied pony. Our man Chaney wasn't seen, but it's certain he was in on that mail hijacking job. Stew? This is worse than a pig trail. Shortest way to Mcallister's. How far is it? Around 60 miles. we'll make 15 today, get an early start tomorrow. How do you like this coon hunt, sister? Don't be looking around for me. I'll be right here. You look like a hog on ice. Bucket is heavy. I'm stronger than I look. What did you bring for us to eat? Oh, salt, red pepper, taffy. Carry those in your pockets? Yeah. Along with cartridges and skinning knife. What are those things? Corn dodgers. Goodness. How many you got in there? Oh, must be 17 5. Can't scarcely credit that. Yeah. Chen Lee must've thought it was for a wagonload of marshals. That tastes like iron. You're lucky to be where water's handy. I've drunken out of a filthy hoof print, and I was glad to get it. If ever I meet one of you Texas waddies who ain't drunk water from a hoof print, l think I'll shake their hand or buy them a Daniel Webster cigar. How long you boys down there been mounted on sheep? Go ahead and have your little joke, but I'll tell you one thing. That little fella will still be running when your big American stud is collapsed. Sheep. Don't you think that fire's a little big if we're going to pass unnoticed? Small fire's ranger policy. Aww. Of all the dumb things-- Listen. I have an idea. Would you like to hear the story of the midnight caller? One of you play the caller, and I'll play all the other parts. Fine. Go ahead and tell it. I'll tell the story if you stop drinking. Let it go. That, baby sister, is no trade. [Turkey Gobbles] [Gunshot] Least little Blackie likes the corn dodgers. It's the salt in them. We won't get to Mcallister's by dark, so we better head for a dugout I know. It's empty, and it's shelter. We can eat your turkey there. I don't see how. It's all ripped up. Yeah. Pretty chewed. Too much gun. I thought you said it'd be empty. Who are ya? What do ya want? We're looking for a place to sleep. Well, there's no room for you here.
