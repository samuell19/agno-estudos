BASED ON THE NOVEL DOUBLE FACE BY JEF GEERAERTS - Mr. Verstuyft. - Sorry. - Here. - I've got one. Here you go. HELP US FIND HER - Eva, hello. - Freddy. You look amazing. And it smells delicious. It was tonight, right? - It's next Friday. - Really? Yes, and the day before that and the day before that. - Come on. - I've got plenty, I'll get another plate. - I'll get another plate. - Right. Vincke should've been police chief by now. But there are people who keep it from happening. That person is at this table. - Who, me? - No, don't be silly. No, I mean me. I couldn't handle the responsibility for all those people. - And I would be a terrible boss. - True. You're a difficult person. And a real perfectionist. - This is really good wine. - No, thank you. I'll write it down. I'll translate it to Bulgarian, so the off-licence can order it. Never mind. Freddy. - Didn't you hear your phone? - Yes. - We got called in. - Yes, got called in. Ready. We found no ID, tags were cut out off the clothing the tip of the fingers are scorched by acid. The body bled out. - And no footprints or tire impressions? - In that loose sand? You let him leave? - Bertje? He's an old bricklayer, he lives here. A bricklayer? What was he doing here at five a.m.? We caught him a few times, poaching rabbits. You'll get a copy of his statement. Nothing special, but he did hear a car leave. Personally, I think he disturbed whoever did this. I think the killer left everything and fled the scene. He left everything? What about the head? Let's go, search. - Found something. - Be careful. Don't let him disturb anything. We found something here as well. And here as well. And here. - Did you find her? I want to see her. - We don't know yet, Mrs Tissot. But I can tell, I'm her mother. Yes, but it's not a good idea to personally... I mean, if your daughter is one of them, the lab will identify her. - She has three moles, right here. - Yes, it's in her file. We've also got her DNA. - I think by tomorrow... - Not tomorrow. Please, right now. I know where those moles are, I can show them to you. I know that, madam. But we have to follow a certain protocol. Hold on a minute. Just take a seat. This is the most recent victim. - How far have you got? - We're not prepared for six at once. I've done a preliminary autopsy on the three most recent ones. And I haven't found anything on the bodies that shows signs of violence. - No violence? - No. - Not even on the latest? - And I don't know when it happened - because I think the body was frozen. - In a freezer? - All of them, the others as well? - So how can you tell when they died? That was going to be tricky, anyway. - I asked Gent for assistance. - Good morning. I'm sorry. Is there someone we can call? Madam? I'll contact someone from Victim Support. Hello. Morning. - Freddy? - I'm coming. Good morning. Did you identify anyone? One of the older victims was once operated on the tibia. Vera van Dijk. - More than three years ago. - They found her bike in Breda - halfway between a club and her house. - Breda? That's more than 24 miles away. We're checking all missing persons within 30 miles. That's not a lot. - Did you go back five years? - We're waiting for files from Holland. Elise Tissot, 25. Julia Steegmans, 44. Tissot, librarian. Vera van Dijk, biochemist. Iris Sluys was a prostitute. She was small and voluptuous while Tissot was more like a model. Blond hair, brown, black. They look nothing alike. - That's what I mean. - Why should they? - A serial killer has a type. - Why? - I've had many different girlfriends. - Yes, and in all price categories. - It's not funny, Benji. - We need to know why them? I want you to look at their laptops, Facebook, social media videos, everything. Why them? What's the connection? They were the easiest target at the right moment. - I'll contact an old friend, Anton Mulder. - Mulder, the Dutchman? - A profiler, wow. - Not a profiler, Vincke. - That's like using a fortune teller. - Well, I'm asking him. This case is too big to go at it alone. Okay guys, a Dutchman. So fun. They've found a woman in Doel. - Hello. - Good morning. Where is she? She's gone. Where he said she was, she's no longer there. "He"? Who's he? A bike tourist thought he'd seen a dead woman lying there. - He thought so, but didn't take a look? - No, he came to us right away. - Let's take a look. - Come on, we'll go this way. Madam? We're the police. Freddy Verstuyft, chief inspector. Goddammit. Come on, it's fine, it's fine. Come. That's better. Haven't I seen you before? I'll put the heating on. My hair's red. There we go. Can you remember where you were yesterday and last night? I had to... I had to get away from that party and it was too cold and too dark and it was dirty and dusty and I... I... I couldn't breathe. I... That wound on your arm, can I take a look? How did you get that? From that car. Your car. Do you know how you got here? Wild party. Don't you know her? Rina van Lierde? Psychologist, was always used to criticize the police force. They'll have a look at her case and if there's a connection they'll let us know. - Mullie. - Hey, Ricky. - Man, it's so good to see you. - It sure is. - Right. - Sorry, Freddy. - Anton Mulder. - Hey, Freddy. - Mullie. - Nice to have you. Nice, nice, nice, nice. Mulder started a joint investigation at Europol. Nice, nice. Could you take those bags? To which hotel? - To my home. - He wanted me to stay with him. Oh, that's nice. Mulder uses fuzzy logic lists to make up his profile and ViCLAS, the Canadian upgrade of ViCAP, which the FBI uses. Cassiers, I know about ViCLAS. Eighty percent is about the crime scene, too bad we don't have one. Sorry, we have to go to the prosecutor's briefing now. No, Freddy, we don't all have to go. So you can put all the data from the autopsy and search reports in ViCLAS. Thank you. - I'll see you later. Bye. - Bye. Come on, Cassiers, you heard him. Get to work. Let's go. - I don't get it, am I in danger? - I'm just here for my own piece of mind. I want to be sure you weren't taken by the man we're looking for. And what if I was? If that is what happened, you are an important witness. A witness who doesn't remember anything. Everything you know can help us. Only bits and pieces. A party, some people. A club. Gin tonic. Gin without tonic. Okay. What kind of question is that? Doesn't she know if she was here or not? Dude, I'm asking you. - Do you have security cameras? - Security cameras? We've got eyes, we have. And? - What, and? - Was she here or not? Maybe, I have no idea. - Okay, thank you. - You're welcome. - Yes, honey? - Abi, it's me. Can you check where there are security cameras near the Roxy? I'll do everything for you. Oh, someone called from Doel. - Doel? - Yes, Doel. It was the night before and nothing was stolen except for a dog's blanket and a yellow vest, so I thought of you. Sorry, I must have been cold. We found her there, so if she came from here, she had to come from the town. Okay, thank you. I remember hands on my face. - Cold water and fiddling with my hair. - Yes, yes. - Something was blocking my eyes. - Tape? A blindfold? Did he say something? I can't remember a voice. But I do think I was lying there a long time. - Anything else? - Yes. A smell. Grain. The smell of grain. Were you here? I think so. And? What do you think? Were you here? - Does something seem familiar? - Only the smell. And the dust made it difficult to breathe. There's no plastic. - I feel like I was lying on plastic. - He could have removed it. Dammit. Come over here. Come here. Keep your head still. Relax. Ouch. I just started to like you, even though you're a cop. I will analyse the dye in your hair. A souvenir. - Abi, can you take... - Hold on. Could you take this to the lab for me? Yes, go ahead. In a minute, yes. Okay guys, listen up. There are some new developments. Europol found a connection to three older cases in Cologne. The bodies were found at Wahner Moor between March 2011 and April 2013. So, our new priority. We're looking for men who moved from Cologne to here around April 2013. Permanently located or temporarily. Get to work. - Or heads will roll. - Dude. I can't be sure if there was sexual violence but I did find adhesive residue on the most recent one. - On the skin. Arms, legs. - Taped together. Cause of death? They just stopped living. I don't know what happened, neither do my colleagues from Gent. There are no wounds on the body, no traceable toxins the organs just shut down. - Shot in the head? - Or blunt force or the carotid was cut or stabbed from behind. Without the head, I don't know. - How was the head... - Removed? The head was mechanically removed with a grinding disc. - Something that is precise. - An electric saw? Is also possible. It was done very neatly. - Why is Harm Schliindorfer on the B-list? - Intensive chemo and he relapsed. Fine, people who moved here from the Cologne region. Steve Serluppens, musician. Ronald Hoybergs, game developer. Conrad Breitner, a NATO soldier. Bas Van der Gracht, a stockbroker. And Ezra Cody, he works at the American embassy. I don't have everything yet, but except for some parking tickets - no one has a record. - That's not unusual. - Here you go. - Thank you. Excuse me? I want to show the photos to Rina, maybe she recognizes someone. - Rina, is she... - The drugged writer we found in Doel. - Vice is dealing with her. - I know, I just wanna show her the photos. - So I can put my mind at ease. - Is it a good idea to show her those - while we're still investigating them? - Come on. We're following Mulder's rules now, let's see what shows up first. Fine. Follow me, please. Mr Hoybergs? These people are from the police. We'll continue our meeting later. Gentlemen, Hoybergs. - CEO of Fly Swat Games. - Nice to meet you. - How can I help? - Just some questions. - You lived in Cologne. - Not just there. My father was a major and we've lived on all the Belgian bases. Right, but between 2011 and 2013 you did live in Cologne. My memory's not that good. Except for a few months when I was in LA, but yes. - Which months were those? - I can ask my secretary - but is that important for some reason? - Well, you're on a list. Oh, I feel honoured. From Friday to Saturday my husband looked after Zachary. I went to an office party. Zachary, not on people's legs. I'm really sorry. Oh, someone seems to have a full diaper. - Ezra Cody. - Mulder. Hand him over, honey. Come on. Here we go, here we go. How can I help you guys? I'm a true multi tasker. I can wipe and talk. We have a few questions on the years you were stationed in Cologne. How exactly can I assist you here? We're investigating a multiple homicide. Djeez, a serial killer? Must be an American then, right? Well, this is not an interrogation. Just a few questions to rule you out. Normally I'd ask you to go through proper channels. And request this at the embassy. We're just ticking off a long list of people who moved from Cologne. I see, I see. Oh, allright. I'm not a big fan of red tape, either. Shoot. Shit. - A normal guy. - Yeah, a real normal guy, right? So let's keep an eye on him. - At the roundabout, turn right. - Go straight. - When by? By yesterday, Kris. - She said go right. Straight ahead. Kris, get me the analysis of the hair dye first. - Highest priority, understood? - Try to make a U-turn. Go that way. - What's this place? - What do you think? It's a car park. I don't feel good doing this behind Vincke's back. If you don't feel good, ask for a pill. I'm sure they can help you. Gentlemen, come to my desk. Well, Rina, this is my colleague Cassiers. Sorry to disturb you at work, but I wanted to show you this right away. There you go. That's them. Take your time. Do you recognise him? No, just a vague feeling of familiarity. But that happens to me a lot. I felt it really strongly with you as well. But I'm sure we've never met before. I would have remembered that. So you had a vague feeling about this one? It's gone now and I don't want to falsely accuse someone. Maybe I'll remember something later. Can I keep these? No, the case is still open. These are copies I made especially for you. Go ahead. Keep them. - I have to report this. - You still owe me one, Cassiers. - Come on now. - I only have one thing to say. - Fatty Victor. - I paid you back like a hundred times. Then this makes it a hundred and one. My silence is priceless. Freddy, come over here. Yes? - I got a lab rapport for a rush order. - That's fast. - I made an impression. - Lab requests go through me, Freddy. You know that. You can't order your own tests. - The lab's busy enough already. - Fine. No, it's not. Our colleagues from Vice are dealing with Rina, period. Well, what does the test say? Rina van Lierde's hair was dyed with Party Hair. A temporary, easy removable spray or mousse. - Anyone can use that. - The analysis of the hairs shows regular use of pills and coke. So I think our Miss Party Hair just blacked out. Vice thinks so too. It's not the first time she disappeared. And not the first time she was found wasted. - But what about her memories? - Could be autosuggestion. You see it with binge drinking and black outs. The brain fills up the holes with the first information available. - Media, Facebook, Twitter. - Or recovered memories. Or is that too simple for profilers? PROZAC It's nice you asked him. He's really good at what he does. - Isn't it too early? - No. Don't worry, he has it under control. - As long as Freddy leaves him alone. - Can't you just tell Freddy? Tell him he's recovering from serious depression. Freddy doesn't have his head on straight. He's wasting time on a lead. - Let me guess. It has to do with a woman? - Yes. And his gut tells him this woman has something to do with our case. But I fear it's more a feeling from below his gut. Here and in Cologne all six women were going somewhere at night alone. By foot or by bike. From a bar, a club, a bar, a night shift and after a fight with her boyfriend. Because the killer is organised we assume he observes his victims and waits for the right moment. The kill itself doesn't satisfy him. He gets rid of the bodies, but keeps the heads. So it's about the heads for him. He has a sexual motive. He wants to reconstruct something, probably a traumatic event from the past. - That's why he needs the heads. - Pardon me. The heads don't look a like. According to your theory, they should look like someone. Yes, you've got a point there, but a killer can be creative - and alter the appearance. Make-up, wigs. - Hair dye. Dye the hair. We can only use victims we're sure about. Right. That's why we are going to dig deep into these men's past. Okay? School, work, hobbies, social media. Mulder will give you the full checklist. Make sure to fill in the questions in a uniform way - so the computer can process it. - Right, men. We're done, the computer will solve it. Stop giving Mulder such a hard time. Just showing the weak points of this profiling thing. - It's not just hocus-pocus. - It tries to predict behaviour. - Behaviour can't be predicted. - But it can, especially your behaviour. But Rina is for Vice. We're investigating the men from Cologne. It's never a good idea to stick to one profile. - You can end up with nothing. - Bitch about profiling at the pub but in my department we're following Mulder's method. Your department? So why are you letting him take charge? Other countries are involved. It's logical to have Europol coordinate it. - Why do you let him take the lead? - I still have the lead. And I'm telling you to stop it. Stop moaning and don't go behind my back. You work with this team or you don't. Do you understand? - Understood? - Yes, thank you. Here you go. - Did you see any movement? - No. Only from the meat in your wrap. - Heads up. - Goddammit. They can smell it when we're eating. Oscar 26 to dispatch. Cody is leaving, we're following. Beta team stand by. Go, go, go. - Benji? - What the fuck? Magistrate? The Americans don't want you to follow Mr Cody. Follow him? We just happened to be around. Whatever, you were noticed. We never obstructed Mr Cody's freedom of movement. I should hope not. You have to understand that when diplomates are involved American diplomates, the political pressure rises. The ambassador himself protested against the harassment of an American citizen. So I want to know if he's really a suspect. We just started the investigation, but he's one of the 11 men - who moved from Cologne to here. - That's not a crime. Especially not when you're leaving Germany. Look, let me talk to him. Mr Cody seemed like a reasonable man. - He understood that it is our job. - It was at Mr Cody's request that the ambassador took action. I'm sorry, Vincke. Here you go. These are from a car park on the square and a side road. - You'll go straight to heaven. - Or straight to jail. - This one is acting suspiciously. - You are as well. It's one a.m. - Look, here you are. - I see. I'm in great shape. There, that's him. He looks around and goes in the same direction. There he is. Did you notice him in the club? - I'll circulate this photo. - No, it's no one. What do you mean? So you know who he is? A boyfriend? Nothing? Is he one of your patients? What are you treating him for? Depression, addiction, you tell me. Anxiety. He... He looks good and is very intelligent. He comes from a rich family. He has everything going for him, but sometimes he gets really anxious and takes all different kinds of drugs. And... That's why he's staying in the clinic. Fine. And he's allowed to go out at night? We aim to have people lead normal lives again. Not to lock them up forever and have them solve puzzles. - What's his name? - No. - What's his name? - No. Involving him in such a gruesome case won't... won't do him any good at all. His anxiety and medication are under control. - He was there. - Yes. He followed you. He may have been the one who spiked your drink. - Don't be stupid. - Being concerned isn't stupid. Patrick is staying in one of the patient rooms on the ground floor. It's about one of your staff, ambassador. Fact is, our investigation was hindered - by your security team. - Your investigation was simply illegal. As you very well know you have to file a request to lift Mr Cody's diplomatic immunity before he can even be investigated. And I should advise you it takes quite an inquiry on our part before we do that. That's why we wanted to meet in person, sir, and discreetly. To find out if there's a way around all that protocol and red tape. We should do this the right way. I wouldn't want to be the cause of procedure mistakes. As I understand it, your system is quite vulnerable to those. Mr Cody is one of the 11 people we are monitoring. About their move from Cologne to Belgium. As you probably already know from your telephone tabs. And computer hacks. It's Belgian humour. I've given up trying to understand it. I've known Mr Cody for quite some time. And I can personally guarantee you that he's not involved. What does that mean, "personally guarantee?" You're willing to serve his jail sentence if you're wrong? You're skating on very thin ice, Mr Vincke. Please, sir. Let us do our job. Mr Cody does not need to know. You have a daughter that age, ambassador. - Where's Verstuyft? - Something about entering reports. Commissioner, that Hoybergs? You know, from those games. - He gave us his diary. - Yes. It doesn't tally with his alibi and the locations of his mobile. Bring him in. He can come and explain that here. He's at a gaming congress in Stuttgart until tomorrow. He asked if he could go. The investigating judge saw no reason to refuse. Do you do talking therapy on the couch? We don't talk all day, have no petting farm and don't do group crafts. We investigate substances that unbalance our patients and we sort out their medication. Patrick is in the swimming pool. Amazing. Are you okay? Patrick? This is Freddy. Freddy wants some information. Hello, detective Verstuyft, pleased to meet you. It's information about me. It's nothing special. It's about me. I'll just take off my wet clothes. I've had to talk to you before about the rules on how to behave with patients. You are too familiar. The rules are there for your own protection. Sven has barricaded himself and I think he stole medication. - I can't come now. - You're the only one he listens to. I'll be right back. So you make the guys sweat. What? No, I look after the swimming pool. - How long has Patrick been here? - Is he in trouble? Thanks. Right. He specializes in game design. He has developed some violent games. Zombie, horror. Then he moved here. And for someone in IT, he's not very active on social media. He doesn't have Facebook or Twitter. There's very little to be found about him. His number of hospital admissions is striking. - Were you at the Roxy Saturday evening? - Yes, I was there. I try to go there now and then. On Rina's advice, in fact. I have to challenge myself, mix with other people. Did she say she was going to be there? No. I only spotted Rina when she left. She didn't reply and was walking unsteadily. I was worried and I went after her. ZOERSEL LIBRARY Right. And what was the problem? She'd already gone by the time I came out. No, I can't reach it. This one. Here, this doesn't float anymore. - Here, that's the right one. - Is Vincke here? Yes. Yes, good evening. - Hi, Freddy. - Eric... Rina needs protection. We can't justify that. We have... Hold on, hold on, hold on. One of her patients who was at the same club the night she disappeared also goes to the library of one of the victims. We'll check that out. But Hoybergs is our priority. Hoybergs will be arrested when he comes back. - Hoybergs? - Yes. If you hadn't been distracted by some attention seeker, you would have known. Attention seeker? Why would she? I don't know, maybe because her novel isn't selling. Is this brilliant conclusion his? Come on, Freddy, sit down. There's some dessert left. Colleagues checked her out. Between studying pharmacology and psychiatric assistant, she was in a convalescent home. Excuse me, I have to... But Freddy, I've also fallen for an attention seeker before. But sooner or later we all get caught up into... Just go and take a shit, with your feeble theories. What? Rina, where are you? Did you get my messages? - No. - Hello? - Freddy? - I can't hear you. - Can you go outside? - What did you do to Patrick? - What did you do to Patrick? - Nothing, just asked some questions. He was really calm. I thought you were different. Silly me. Rina, I... Goddammit. I have to tell you something. I'm dancing. Cassiers, what was so urgent? I think I know why Hoybergs spent so much time in hospitals. That's from the local news section of a national newspaper. May 1977. He's not on social media, but his past is. Hoybergs was disabled. - Rina, everything okay? - Yes, where were you? Fuck, there was someone downstairs. - Let me see. - I have to report it, my phone is broken. - Can I borrow yours? - Come. Sit down. That's gonna leave a scar. Shame you won't see it with that hair of yours. A scar... On a man, that's... That's pretty sexy. I could get suspended for this. Only if I tell someone. Look at me. Don't you dare come. Eleven spinal surgeries. Four in Germany, five in Switzerland and two here, for wear-and-tear. - Eleven surgeries. - A spine is corrected gradually. Literally disc by disc. And rehabilitation is painful. Has it had any effect psychologically? He... The pain can become too much. There are moments he still sees himself as a sort of hunchback. He feels watched and can react defensively. Defensively or aggressively? But with the right medication it's been under control for years now. Bot those painkillers are another matter entirely. I know he's been admitted to a clinic a few times already. Is that the site of the rehabilitation centre? They've really helped him. He made a donation for a gym. We should talk to those people. Hold on, go back to the previous one. May I? Hey, he knows Rina. - He knows his victims. - Freddy was right. Hello. Patrick fixed my espresso machine. Not with a hammer, right? Found it in the bathroom. Patrick looses control if he doesn't have a hammer somewhere. Just like a stuffed animal for a toddler. An illusion of safety. - When was he here? - Yesterday. You don't think he was the one lurking around? Why would he do that? If he rings the doorbell, I'll answer it. Always. I do that for all my patients. How well do you know Patrick? - Are you expecting someone? - No. Yeah, I... I stayed the night because I saw someone lurking around. So it seemed like a good idea to stay here. They attacked me, look. Hit me on the head. I didn't report it because my phone is broken. But I'll write a report later. I was just going to take a shower. Boys. Good morning. There are some new developments, you'll get protection. Thank you. Do you recognise this man? Here you go. Maybe this jogs your memory. That photo was taken at the rehab centre where I was an intern. The opening of the new gym. I saw him there, as a patient. Rina said at the beginning that one of the photos seemed vaguely familiar. - Hold on. - Keep walking. - You slept with her. - In her apartment, yes. I'm not stupid, you know. How stupid can you be? Having sex with a victim? - So now she is a victim? - Indecent assault abuse of position, breech of trust. She can get them to throw the book at you. - Rina won't do that. - No, she so stable. - There are no witnesses. - What about me? And those two also saw you, I have to report this. - Excuse me? - I have to report it. - Or she can sue us all. - I just said... Fuck, I'm done with this. Just follow your rules. - Do what you love. - You stay away from her. You do exactly what Mulder and I tell you to do. You'll write everything down that happened. And everything you know about her. And from now on you focus on Hoybergs. And you stay at the station, you hear me? Yes. That's Veronique's. If we have more news, we'll let you know. - Maybe we shouldn't think the worst. - Of course. Let's stay positive. Maybe she just spent the night with a cop. Federal police, where is she? - Who? - Hands in front. - Who are you talking about? - Where is she? - Who? - Hands in front. - Be more specific. - Where is she? Take him away. Tell us if she's still alive. I don't know what you want, I don't know them. Don't let her die. If you help us save her, that will be to your advantage during your trial. You can stay here, but all you may do is breathe. Why was your phone off? - So we couldn't trace you? - It was a gaming event. During demos, my phone is off. It's called being polite. Right. We checked your hotel. You didn't eat breakfast. Not hungry? - I seldomly eat breakfast. - Of course. The diary you gave us, isn't in line with reality. My diary is never correct, there are always last minute changes. You don't seem to get what of a mess you're in. Similar murders happened in the Cologne area when you lived there. You're in the same picture as one of the victims. - There are a lot of photos of me. - Bullshit. There are very little photos of you. Maybe that's how you stayed under the radar for so long. Where is she? Come on, unburden yourself. Tell us she's still alive. Think of what her parents are going through. - You also have children. - Stop that. I didn't do anything, here or in Cologne. In Cologne I worked with a colleague, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. - He can testify. - What's his name? Menken, Andreas Menken. Okay, be careful what you say now. Because I will send people to talk to Menken. That's not necessary, Menken lives in Brussels. We travelled for weeks at a time and he slept at the office. He went back and forth? But he was with you 24/7. Menken was in Germany then and now here, so he's not on our list. What are you doing here? Weren't you watching Rina? Yes, it was cancelled as soon as Hoybergs was arrested. And what if it's not Hoybergs? DOORMAN Mr Menken, police. It's no use, sir. I haven't seen him for days. - I think he's got a girl somewhere. - Do you see him with women? Never, why? - Is he wanted for something with women? - We just need to talk to him. It's not about the women without a head, right? I don't believe this. Really? I have a master key. No, no, no, thank you. It's not legal, is it? I never do it, of course. I swear on my grandmother's grave. Search warrant? - Who's that? - It's Freddy, look. Watch out. - Rina, watch out. - It's Freddy. Patrick, it's me. - Do you remember me? - He's a friend. - He's not, look at his eyes. - Don't you remember me? - His eyes. - Freddy is a friend. He's not a friend. He stopped taking the pills and it's your fault. - You have to take your pills. - They're not mine. It's poison. - I'll call emergency services. - No, no, no. - Freddy likes us. - No, he likes you. - He'll take you away. - No. You're coming to take her. No one is leaving. Give me your hand. Stroke his head. It's okay. It's okay. When he wakes up, he won't remember this. You can't stay here. We're not sure it's Hoybergs. I can stay at the clinic, I won't be alone there. - Help me put him in the car. - You need to stop this. - Take his feet. - He's too dependent. It's not healthy that he comes over here. Get his feet. I've never been inside. Never. - Damn. - That was to be expected. Danny? Police. Come with me. What's this? - What's this? - It's deleting all files. Fuck, stop it, stop it. Fuck. Goddammit. I pulled the plug, but it's still going. There must be a battery. They couldn't save more. This is from a game he was developing. His description has been circulated but we haven't released his name yet. - We don't want him to panic. - No. Then Veronique won't stand a chance. No, we're taking the side entrance, there's a lot of press. - You don't like the press? - Our people will take you home. No need, my lawyer will take me. - And our apologies. - My lawyer will demand compensation. Commissioner? This is the latest news. THE KILLER OF KALMTHOUT? Damn. - Now he'll disappear. - Who told the press? Right. You're kidding. No, no signs that Veronique or anyone else was in that apartment. - Or Menken is an obsessive cleaner. - He has a place somewhere else. That doorman wouldn't overlook a woman coming by. Commissioner, an urgent call from one of the teams. Suspicious movement at Cody's. He stopped by a young woman. We are just observing. Mulder is from Europol, they can't take part in interventions. - Yes... - Sorry, Mul. - You stay here. - Desk duty. Liquorice? - He's taking her with him. - The hen is with the rooster. He's going north, towards Esmoreit. Just wait and don't go at it alone, unless she's in danger. And be careful, he has a gun permit. We're heading for the river. The river. Not too close, Benji. Benji, turn off your lights. You're kidding me. - Where did he go? - No way. Dammit. There. What's wrong? - I don't hear him. - You lost him? - He went this way. - He has to be close. Split up and warn us when you see him. His car is 200 metres past the fork in the road, by an oak tree. - Just stop. - Fuck you, no, I'm not having it. Get back. Come back here. Don't touch me. - Police, stop. - Get off me. - Get off. - Get off of her, get off. - Stay on your knees, hands on your head. - What the fuck is this? On your head, sir. On the head, sir. - What... - On your head. Get off of him. Don't touch him. - Calm down. - What is this shit? - Calm down, what happened? - Nothing. He did nothing. That's the point. He was supposed to tell his wife. And you were gonna leave her, you fucker. But all you want is a quick fumble in the woods. - That's all I'm good for. - You? Were you fucking watching me? Is that what this is? Am I under fucking surveillance, still? Shit is so gonna hit the fan, big time. Absolutely. When your wife hears about this shit will be everywhere. But you're a multi tasker, you can wipe and talk. No, no, no, no. I'm not pressing any charges here. So you can't tell my wife. THERAPEUTIC INSTITUTIONS, GERMANY CHECK FOR PATRICK MANTEAU DURING WAHNER MOOR MURDERS I heard you were looking for me. Did he tell you where Veronique is? It's not him. It's not him, Vincke. And you found out in half an hour? His profile. His past, his running away. Everything we found at his place. - All out the window? - Yes. - And why is he not the killer? - Because I believe him. - You believe him. - He's been in a monastery in France. To work without being disturbed. Without a cell phone, internet, nothing. He came back because one of the new visitors told him. That's not possible. There must be another explanation. Someone is on their way to the monastery. But I'm almost sure that his alibi will be confirmed. - He thinks his boss framed him. - Hoybergs? - He knew where he was all this time. - So why didn't he tell us? The only thing we can do is check Hoybergs out again. But you'll have to do it without me because I have to go change for my meeting with the magistrate at half past eight. I have to tell him where and who I slept with. Thanks for that. Good morning. I've come to see the examining magistrate, at his invitation. - May I have your ID card? - Of course. You can wait here, I'll come and get you. Suzanne? Why are you calling with Rina's... Are you okay? Fuck. Rina, say something. I think it happened last night, because we had aqua gym... - Where's Patrick? Where? - He's in sleep therapy. Luckily he wasn't here, he would've freaked. Get out of my way. - Are there any witnesses? - You'll have to find out. We're leaving. - Freddy, you have to stay away. - But that animal doesn't. Freddy, she stays here. - She's not safe. - We'll look after her. She needs to give a statement. My uncle hasn't been here for years. Come in. So you don't think it's Menken? I think his boss framed him. Hoybergs is our number one suspect now. I have to go back to the magistrate. I have no choice, but it won't take long. You're safe here, okay? The magistrate has just left and not in a great mood. Okay, you have to come in again tomorrow at 8.30. - Okay? - Yes. I caught something too. From the night store. I also found something else. What? Are you going to arrest me? Maybe. It's pure, straight from my pharmacy. I can't do that. It's no fun if only one of us takes it. We're in it together. Goddammit, the examining magistrate. What? HOYBERGS FOUND WITH DEAD GIRL IT'S OVER, SEE YOU LATER? MAYBE I'm not sure, Freddy. Is walking out on the magistrate twice the stupidest thing you ever did or is it your affair with Rina? Mulder thinks the latter. But he doesn't know our public prosecutors. Personally I'd say the examining magistrate. Yeah, that's why I'm here. The case is solved now, so I thought you could maybe put in a good word for me. Beyers, can you go with him? Make sure detective Verstuyft goes directly to the examining magistrate. You did it yourself, so deal with it yourself. I'm done, Eric. I'm done. We ask a lot of you, but there's no other way. You have a gift. It's gone, it has been gone for years. Maybe it was never there. Of course it was. I'm going to do something else with my life. It's over. - Patrick, I need to let you go. - No. - Yes. - No. No. Do you understand me? Oh boy, everything okay? What's wrong? What's wrong? I'm here for you. Suzy, not right now. This is Rina, you know what to do after the beep. I'm sorry, the examining magistrate thinks you should wait another 24 hours. - So he fired his gun like this? - Then we should've seen more blood here. Look at this. You see blood spatter everywhere, but not here. - You see? - So? - May I? - Sure. That's the only explanation for the lack of blood. So someone forced him? The hair dye is identical to the dye we tested earlier. From Rina? And cause of death? I examined three of them and they had blunt force trauma. It was a different weapon every time, but I'm sure that it was a hammer every time. HAMMER - Reminds me of Freddy. - Which Freddy? - Which Freddy? Freddy Verstuyft. - He no longer works here. Fine, I get it. Freddy, who no longer works here, sent me an email about a certain Patrick and he called him the man with the hammer. I asked him who Patrick Manteau was. And that's when he said it. Was that Patrick there? At the rehabilitation centre? Well, you told us to ignore orders from Verstuyft. So you didn't check it? He wasn't there, but I looked further and Patrick was at a semi-open clinic in Limburg. Near the border, at 15 miles from Wahner Moor. - And when those women disappeared? - I'm still checking. But he was stopped by traffic cops for reckless driving one night. He tested positive for cocaine and his passenger took over. - A woman? - It doesn't say. But it was three miles from a place where one of the women disappeared that night. When I say ignore orders from Verstuyft, I do mean ignore his orders. But good job. Open the door. The big Verstuyft. When it comes to his mouth anyway. I would've paid to put you in handcuffs. And now look at you. Maybe I should buy a lottery ticket as well. That would be great, then you can retire. A disaster for your local bar but a blessing for police and society. Sorry commissioner, we can't keep the magistrate waiting. - The suicide was staged. - What? We have reason to believe it was Patrick Manteau. - Fuck, I knew it. You should've listened. - We think he took her. - No, it can't be. - Dammit, Freddy. We don't know where she is. She not at home or at work, nowhere. Where could she be, Freddy? We found her colleague, Suzanne, dead in his room. Where can Rina be, Freddy? Where? Four texts to Verstuyft and two calls to Patrick. - Did we send out an APB? - We have to redo the profile. I'm done with profiling, I just want my killer. The killer. Patrick, I have to let you go. It's over. I wanted to reassure you, but we haven't got him yet. I'll call you later. I have to go see the magistrate now. Vincke was petty enough to report me because of us. Think of me. - Check out those older voicemails. - Yes. - Here, 17 seconds. That's Patrick. - Yes. Rina, I need to see you. Where are you? Rina? Rina, I'm already here. That's the carillon. He's near the cathedral. - Moriaan street. - Car? On foot is faster, call for back up. No sirens, we don't want to spook him. Team Bravo, all channels. SWAT intervention, Moriaan street 26. Suspect Manteau, may have a weapon. Is possibly holding a woman hostage. Come on, Verstuyft. - Back up, we don't want him to panic. - Where's Rina? Set up a perimeter. No one goes in. We'll wait here for intervention. - Verstuyft is here. - How? He went inside through a trapdoor. Wait here. - Fuck, Cassiers. - Sorry. - Does no one listen? - I didn't want you to go alone. Goddammit. Are you okay? Listen to me. Are you okay? It's me, it's okay. - Freddy? - Clear. Goddammit. Stay here. People are on their way, okay? Fucking hell. Stay there, stay. Where did Freddy go? Cassiers, call an ambulance and lay on top of her to heat her up. Freddy, don't. The intervention team is on its way. Goddammit. Hey, calm down. Sir, are you okay? Are you hurt? Sir? Stay there. Stay there. Don't move. Stay there. Stay there. - Are you okay? - Yes. Don't let me go. - Are you hurt? Should I take a look? - I'm fine, it's okay. I need to explain something, commissioner. The reason I let Verstuyft do as he likes is because - he knows something about me. - Not Fatty Victor, right? Everybody knows. Where is the key? Did forensics take it already? No, we've left everything as it was. - Where are they? - They were fine. They didn't want to come. That policeman took care of her. Find his car. Use the traffic cameras. Now, Cassiers. Why hasn't he been located? There are thousands of cameras in the city. She manipulated us. She knows how profilers work and we fell for it. - We found her naked and wasted in Doel. - Maybe she was caught with a body. The smartest thing is to pretend to be the victim. You're caught and let yourself be found naked. - Exactly. - I wouldn't think of that. - Did Patrick say anything? - A lot of things. - He kept talking. - Did he say why? I didn't really listen, I was freezing to death. Yes? Through the old tunnel to Linkeroever. Freddy, I'm going away for a while. Why don't you come with me? And those heads? She knew the injuries would lead us to Patrick. When did those heads show up? When we had no other suspects. So she sacrificed Patrick. - Patrick wasn't... - Patrick is in the past. Patrick bashed those heads in and that's final. Anxiety psychosis. You saw how he gets when he doesn't take his pills. But who controls the pills? Yes, there. - Goddammit, Rina. What did you do? - Patrick hit them. You can't prove who held his hand. The freezer. The freezer wasn't locked. It's over, Rina. It's over. No. It's starting now. Fuck, Freddy. Freddy, it's me. - Back up. - I'm sorry. You have to tell the examining magistrate... that I... have to reschedule my appointment again.
