- Down! - Hut! Hut! Down! Hut! I remember my first game of football. Something happened that afternoon that's hard to explain. I felt like I could do anything. I felt... free. I didn't know much about what that word meant then. "Free." Not like I do now. Freedom doesn't just start on the football field. It starts in the mind. Banks, Brandon, cover two. Ready? Go right. Go right. Come on, bruh! Wingback. Wing. Come on! Good job. Good hustle today, Banks. Thanks, Coach. Though it took a minute for that muscle memory to kick in. I know we're not SC, but we are glad to have you here. - This is Brian. - Need you in my office 9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning, Banks. Well, I thought our next meeting wasn't until next month. Special meeting. Be there. All right, listen up, children. Those of you who have seen the news, I'm sure you know, Sacramento has implemented a new law last week, that all 290 registrants who are currently on parole must wear one of these. It's a GPS tracking monitor that you wear on your ankle. Put your hand down, son. I already know your question. Can you take it off? The answer is never, ever. You must wear this thing 24/7. You charge it in the morning. You charge it in the evening. Now, remember, you must be within LA County, but cannot be within 2,000 feet of a school or a park. Are we clear? You know I've been playing football at Long Beach City College. Not anymore you're not. You can't bust this thing up. Can I just remove it while I play? - No. No. No way. - But I gotta play, sir. You see, I'm trying to work my way back to a shot at the NFL. You know how many kids tell me that every day? They want to be in the NFL, NBA, rap stars. Forget about football. Boyhood dreams got no place in a man's life. You need to concentrate on getting employed. Or you can dick around, end up right back in the system. It's on you. Next. No, no, no, no, no, no! No! No! Maybe they'll cut your time short. They ain't gonna cut it short. Well, maybe you can play football when it's up. Mom, nobody starts playing football at 27. I think we'll get along well. Today marks the culmination of a five-year battle by the California Innocence Project to right a terrible wrong. Twenty-one years ago, this man was convicted and locked away for a crime he didn't commit. Write them again. They already turned me down, Mom. This time don't tell them about your case. Tell them about you. Tell them who you are. Dear Mr. Brooks, I am writing you again in the hope that the California Innocence Project will reconsider my case. I know you hear from a lot of people, but maybe if you got to know me, you might reconsider. Let me state, clearly and unequivocally, I am innocent. I spent six years in prison and the past three on parole for a sex offense that I did not commit. I wrote you two years ago from CMC and you turned me down. But I don't stay down. Not for long. I learned that in prison and I learned it growing up, too. You see, I played a lot of football when I was young. And it wasn't all ice cream and pizza parties. No, sir. I had a different walk home. Life in Long Beach was for real and it was hard to see a way out. But football gave me an option. It taught me discipline and dedication, and strangely, it gave me faith. Because Mom said my talent was God-given. So, each night, I promised to give something back in return. By the time I was 16, I wasn't just your average high school football player. I was what they called a sure thing. All-American Brian Banks with the tackle! Brutal hit by Brian Banks, all the way up here in the press box. I played middle linebacker on one of the best teams in the country. We had 2,000 fans at every game. But to be honest, I only heard one. Yay! That's my baby! The sky's the limit for this kid. Even though I was just a sophomore, I had the attention of the media... Big game coming up, Brian. Remember, we're doing that feature on you. You'll call me, right? - Oh, yes, sir. - Great game. ...and the best coach in college football... - Who's up? - Hey, Coach Carroll. - Brian! - ...Coach Pete Carroll of USC. Good to see you, man. Just reviewed the tape on you from last season. - Amazing! - Aw, thanks, Coach. Can't wait to see what you bring today. We do this right, we're not just talking about the Rose Bowl. We're talking NFL and a lifetime of opportunities. Coach Carroll was someone I looked up to, and his belief in me made a world of difference. What does it say? - USC. - Huh? - It says USC. - Yeah! But all that changed on July 8, 2002. You know that feeling you get that tells you something is off? Some say it's the voice of God. Had I listened to that voice, we might not be here today. But I didn't. And here we are. Wait, wait, hold up, hold up. - Yeah? - Pack it up. Get out of there. - I'm not done with the job yet. - No, you are done. The monitor says that you're at Pomona fairgrounds. "Fair" and "sex offender" do not go together, Banks. Sir, we're only here for a couple more hours. You know how long it took me to get this job? - If I leave now, I'll get fired. - Yeah, if you don't leave now, might as well drive yourself straight to County. Pack it up. Get your ass out of there. All right, so I'm innocent. What are my options? Anybody? Come on, what are my options? - Yes. - Take it to the Supreme Court? No. You have no Constitutional right to take it to the Supreme Court, even if you're innocent. The best you can do is take it to the state level. And good luck with that in California. Because? I'm gonna keep telling you guys this. It is almost impossible to overturn a conviction here in California. We make those people out in Alabama look like a bunch of liberals. I quote: "New evidence must completely undermine the prosecution's case and point unerringly to innocence." All right? That's it for today. Thanks. - Mr. Brooks, I'm Brian Banks. - Oh, hey, Brian. Yeah, you're the football player, right? You got my letter. I got your letters. Plural, right? Look, Brian, I know Alissa explained to you, we only work with wrongly imprisoned people. - I was wrongly imprisoned. - I know. I know. But you're out now. Okay? It's a good thing. And you took a plea. - I only took a plea because I was... - You don't have to explain. It's okay. It's okay. 97% of all cases plead out. But you didn't go to trial, so you can't appeal. There's nothing you can do. There's always something you can do. - You can file a habeas petition. - A what? It's a writ of habeas corpus. You challenge the conviction based on new evidence. But if you were paying attention in there, you heard me. It's gotta be damn good evidence. All right? I gotta go. Let me tell you about my DNA evidence. Which you had at the time, right? You didn't use it. That's what I'm trying to tell you, Brian. You need something new. New piece of evidence. A new witness who can place you somewhere else at the time of the incident, or a recantation by the complainant. - What's that? - Well, basically, the girl would have to say you didn't do it. Come on, man. I go anywhere near that girl, they're gonna put me right back in prison. There ain't no way that girl gonna flip. She got paid a million and a half bucks. She what? Her and her mom sued the school district for lack of security. They got 1.5. All right. Well, look, Brian, I've got clients, innocent people. They've been locked up 20, 30 years. They'd love to be able to take a nice drive to San Diego. The criminal justice system is messed up. It's supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. A lot of cases, it's the exact opposite. It sounds like yours included. I'm sorry. What's that thing called again? A writ of what? Habeas corpus. Hey, Corey, look, man, I really appreciate what you're trying to do, but I ain't gonna be surprised if the owner's got a problem with this. Brian, I've known you since we were kids. I'm gonna talk to the owner, let him know you're a straight-up dude, and that he has nothing to worry about. Because he doesn't. - All right. Thanks, man. - I got you. It means the world, all right? Hey, Karina, come here for a sec. I want to introduce you to my man Brian. He's gonna be working here soon. Great. Nice to meet you. Let me tell you something about this dude. Back in the day, baddest football player ever. Yeah. I'm telling you. You don't play anymore? Uh, I'm not in playing shape right now. Karina could help you with that. This girl right here is fierce. Get you back in tip-top shape in no time. So, listen, I'm gonna call you in a few days. All right. Thanks again. - Really. - No problem, man. I got you. Corey's great. Treats people really well. Oh, he's stepping out for me, that's for sure. So, are you gonna work out? Uh, I'm thinking about it. Corey said it was cool, so, you know. Well, I can train you if you want. Oh, wow, look, uh, that's really generous. Thank you. But things have been kind of tight for me lately, so... No problem. First session is complimentary. Really. Come on. Let's see what you got. Push it. Nice. Arch the back. Four, three, five... six. Both arms. Both arms. And rest. Nice. Yeah. - Hey, let's go. - Yeah, in a minute. Nice. Nice. Nice. Okay. Pump those knees. Stick the landing. Give me ten. Okay. So, I... I wanted to get my masters, but, uh... I have so many student loans that I just thought, you know, why not take a break, work, chip away at some of that debt. And before I knew it, two years turned into five and still not in grad school, but... So, what you studying? I majored in art. What? That's cool. Anyway, Columbia is the dream for grad school. So, fingers crossed. Hey. Got them crossed. Anyway, what about you? You used to be a football player. Yeah. But you don't play anymore? I'm hoping to. What happened? Why don't you play? Okay, Karina, look, if we're gonna hang out, be friends, there's something I gotta tell you. Okay. When I was 16, I was accused of something I didn't do. Now, this is back in high school. You know, I was on my way to USC, full ride, football, everything, right? This young lady falsely accused me... I've just been working to get my life back. Clear my name. - Uh... - Yeah. I, uh... I have to go back to work. - I'm sorry. Let me... - Yeah. No, I mean, it's your job. I'll give... I'll give you something. No, don't worry about it. I got it. - I got... Yeah. - I'll see you at the gym. Okay? It's okay. It's okay. Yeah. Mom. Mom! Your assignment this week is to copy this, and tape it to your cell wall where you can see it morning, noon and night. This circle is your life. And the goal is to travel this circle until you get back to who you are. Now, most people never make it because of this. In here are distractions. You gotta have more. You gotta make more. You gotta keep up with the Joneses. But you gentlemen have been given a gift. You've been removed from these distractions. You can't get more. You can't make more. Given the right perspective, prison can set you free, and your despair can become a doorway. Use that despair and never give up on what lives within you. California Innocence Project. Hi. This is Brian Banks. May I please speak to Alissa Bjerkhoel? It's Brian Banks again. You want to take it or you want me to? No, no, no. I got it. I got it. Okay. Brian. Hey, I saw your habeas petition. You can't just put us down as your attorneys, Brian. I had to put somebody down just in case they gave me a hearing. - Which they're not gonna do because... - Yeah, I know. They sent me a copy of this. I tried to tell you. - You need some new evidence. - So help me find some. It's out there. It's gotta be, 'cause I'm innocent. I've had prisoners put together their own habeas petitions before. Never very good. But this is... Guys, I see you hiding out there. Why don't you just come on in? You sure you didn't have any help with this? You didn't get me any, remember? Right. Well, you got a real fan club up here, Brian. I'm gonna have a mutiny on my hands unless we do something. So, Marilyn and Alissa are gonna head up to Los Angeles, ask you a few questions, all right? Meanwhile, I don't want you to go outside county lines. Does that mean you're taking on my case? No. It doesn't mean that. In fact, I'm hesitant to even have this conversation with you for fear that I'm gonna get your hopes up. But if we have an inkling that we can help somebody out, we try and at least grant them an interview. So you have an inkling. No, I didn't say that. - You just did. - You definitely did. - No, I said "if" I have an inkling. - Inkling. A slight knowledge, hint or suspicion. Middle English origin. I read the dictionary twice when I was in prison, Mr. Brooks. We gotta go, Brian. - Happy? - Come on. Let's go. So, is it okay if we record you? - Absolutely. - Okay. Now we need you to walk us through the incident. Can you tell us what happened that day? I just left history class. I was gonna call this reporter. This is Mike. Leave a message. Hey, Mr. Paley, it's Brian Banks. Um... Guess I'll just try you after school. Her name was Kennisha Rice. I knew her from middle school. Her and her sister Ava. Hey, Kennisha, what up? What you doing? Bathroom. Bathroom that way. I was gonna go to the 700 building. I mean, you want me to walk with you? Okay. Okay. The 700 building was across campus. It had this place where everybody went to make out. The whole school knew about it. That if you liked a girl and a girl liked you, you always ended up there. But it was tricky to get to. There was this long hallway, and you had to be really quiet. But if you made it through... ...you were on your own. Usually. What you trying to do? What's up? Mmm. And then I was thinking, "What are you doing? If we get caught, then I get kicked out of summer school, and that could mess up the whole football season." So when I heard the teacher, I stopped. I stopped. Hey, look, I ain't really feeling this no more, so... Um... You go out that way. I'm gonna go out that door. All right? There's just so many things I could have said. "I don't want you to get in trouble," or... "I just don't think this is special enough of a place." But I was 16. I wasn't grown-up enough. And to be honest, I just went back to class and I forgot about it. But she didn't forget. She went back to math class. Was with her friend Shayla. And that's where it all went wrong. While she and her mom were with the police, I was at home. I still remember my dream. It was that same feeling I had when I was a kid. The feeling of being free. Don't move! Let's go. - Put your hands behind your back. - Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - Shut up! - But I ain't do nothing! - I didn't do nothing! - Shut up! - Mom! Mom! Mom! - Get him up! Get him up! - Get him out of here! - Mom, I didn't do nothing! Where are you taking my son? Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian's problem is that he told the truth. Without legal counsel present, he admitted to being in the stairwell with Kennisha, and the DA determined there was probable cause. Two months later, Brian was removed from juvenile court and tried as an adult. Two counts of felony rape and one count of sodomy with an enhanced circumstance of kidnapping. His mother had to sell their house and their car to afford a new attorney. According to the record, every time Kennisha told her story, it changed. And how did he drag her down a hallway by a bunch of open classrooms - without being noticed? - Exactly. Unfortunately, no one ever visited the hallway. Not the attorneys, not the investigators. - And the DNA evidence? - It came back negative. Which supports Brian's assertion they never had sex. So, why did he plea? Did you ask him? I'm sorry, folks. We need a 30-minute recess while I meet with counsel in chambers. I got some good news. I worked out a deal with the DA. They gonna drop the charges? Kidnapping and sodomy charges if you agree to plead no contest to one count of rape. - What's no contest? - It means you don't contest the charges. You don't plead guilty, you don't plead not guilty. But I am not guilty. Brian, I have seen this too many times. You admitted to some intimate contact, so it comes down to consent. Who's the jury gonna believe? And did you see all those white folks out there? All they see is a big black teenager accused of rape. And if any of them end up on the jury, they're gonna find you guilty. But if you take this deal, you are almost guaranteed probation, and in three months' time, you can be back to your family. Back to your life. Back to playing football. You'd be free. Okay. Can I talk to my mom about this? No, Brian. You've been charged as an adult and you need to make this decision yourself. And they've only given us ten minutes to decide. - Ten minutes? - Then the deal is off the table. You need to decide now. You wanna go home, put this behind you, or do you want to risk your whole life for something you didn't do? Ten minutes, Brian. So, Mr. Banks, it's my understanding that you wish to enter a plea. Is that correct? Uh... Yes. Yes, sir. Now, you understand that a plea of no contest has the same legal effect as a plea of guilty. That you will be required to register as a sex offender for the rest of your life. Do you understand that? Mr. Banks? Do you understand? Yes, sir. Brian Keith Banks, on count one, that you committed the crime of forcible rape, a felony, how do you plead? No... No contest. Probation is denied. Defendant is to be imprisoned for a total of six years, followed by five years of supervised parole. No! No! - No, no, wait, wait. - It's not right! - That's what you get. - This isn't right! - Six years? - My son is innocent... - No, hold... Wait. Mom! - Brian! Mrs. Ford, you were supposed to keep my son out of prison. You didn't say six... You ain't say nothing about six years! - Mom! Mom! - Brian! Now you about to pay for raping my daughter. Hold on, wait a minute! Wait a minute! My son is innocent! My son is innocent! My son is innocent! Really good job, you guys. You laid out the facts of the case really clearly. How does any of this help Brian? What about the DNA? I know. I know. A lot of really bad stuff happened. Not to mention he got questionable advice from his attorney. But they had the DNA evidence, all right? And they didn't use it. We can't either. Right? There's nothing new here, guys. Alissa, Marilyn, I sent you guys up to LA to dig around. - Did you find any new evidence that hasn't been submitted? - There was never a trial. So there have to be witnesses that weren't questioned. - We can find them and talk to them. - And when are we gonna do that? Are we gonna take away time from cases we have a legitimate chance of winning? The Johnson case is definitely gonna push. I'll find the time. I got spring break coming up. I can use my time to question a few people. - I've got time. I'm happy to help. - Me too. - I'll help. - I can. I definitely can help. He's innocent. We got this. This is your fault. This is Brian. Hey, Brian, it's Alissa. - Do you have your 2002 yearbook, by chance? - Yeah. Okay, great. Do you think you can identify some of the students you went to summer school with? Oh, yes, ma'am. Right away. What's up? Hey, yo, Eli, what's up, man? It's B. Yeah, it's been a while, man. And then out of the blue, Kennisha says, "Well, just so you know, I wasn't even really raped. I only said that so my mom wouldn't find out I was getting with boys." Shayla, would you be willing to put all of this in writing? - Yeah. - That's great. I'm sorry, man. Hey. You tried, man. You tried. Brian? How'd it go with Corey? Did you get the job? Actually, the owner said no. But, uh... Corey, nah, he was great. Really went to bat for me. - Listen, I'm... sorry about the other day. I... - It's fine. Look, there's no good way to tell a bad story. All right? And no matter how I tell it, people always gonna wonder if I'm telling the truth, so... I'm not wondering anymore. Corey and I spoke, and I know now that you didn't deserve what happened to you. The other day, I hesitated when I told you I was an art major. It's because whenever I say it, people judge me. Brian, I judged you. And I am so sorry. In football, we used to say, "Spend too much time thinking about the last play, you won't be ready for the next one." So, you want to work out with me? First session's complimentary. Brian? Well, I'm not gonna work out in this. I'll be back in five minutes. Five minutes. Don't lock me out. ♪ Yo, oh, whoa ♪ ♪ While my heart's Still beating ♪ ♪ Take me alive ♪ One more time, everybody now! ♪ Yo, oh, whoa ♪ ♪ Yo, oh, whoa ♪ ♪ While my heart's Still beating ♪ ♪ Take me alive ♪ ♪ And while my heart's Still beating ♪ ♪ Take me alive ♪ Give it up for Justin! Thank you all, and don't let my playing affect your donations. You're a man of many talents. Hey. Well, when I was younger, I wanted to be a rock star. If I could have sung worth a lick, never would have gone to law school. Lucky for me, you can't sing. Was it that bad? It was pretty bad. So, I'm guessing Alissa told you how to find me tonight? If I say yes, is she in trouble? Well, Alissa's always in trouble. I happen to like that about her. You got a little time before your curfew? Yeah. Okay. Come on. Show me. I'm sorry, what happened? I think the table's slanted. Come ready! - I respect it. I respect it. - Whoo! Pow. That's it? You giving up? I'm out of money. Hope you're happy. I'll be happy when you represent me. Mmm. Brian, I want to help you. I do. And in a perfect world, you and I would just waltz into the court, you tell them what Shayla said and they'd reopen your case. But that is not the world we live in. The system is broken. It's what I'm trying to tell you. It just doesn't care. I'm just supposed to accept that, that the system is broken? Well, you know what I say to that? Fuck the system. No, for real, man. I mean, why can't we at least try? What is the system? It's people. Yeah? It's cops, lawyers, judges. If one of them had just cared enough to even go down to that hallway Kennisha said I dragged her, listened to how the tiniest little noise echoes, I wouldn't have this damn thing on my leg. - Mr. Brooks... - Justin. Justin. I know the system doesn't care about me. I've known that my whole life. The question is, do you? I carry three pictures in my wallet. My, uh... My wife, my kids and, uh, that one right there. That's her on the left. My longest-standing client, Marilyn Mulero. One day I'm looking through the newspaper and I see that Marilyn gets the death penalty on a plea bargain. I'm wondering, how's that even possible, to get death on a plea? Where's the bargain? So, I look into it. Sure enough, this woman here, she's the one that pulled the trigger. I find a couple of witnesses, I find a mountain of evidence, and I lose. Eighteen years. With new evidence. Marilyn's still behind bars. She's the reason I started the CIP and I'm not giving up until she's free. So, yeah, I can be a little jaded. But every once in a while, we win. And it's amazing... seeing an innocent person go free. And we do it because we bust our asses and we know what the system wants. Something extraordinary. You want me to be your lawyer, Brian? We've already looked at your case, talked to potential witnesses. I even called the parole board about shortening your time. The well is dry. So let me tell you what I need to argue your case. Not some piece of hearsay evidence from ten years ago. I need something big. Earth-shattering. Extraordinary. Sorry. Just a reminder. You do have a family. Going soon. What is that? This is the hallway Brian supposedly dragged that girl down. All the doors were open. I checked the school records. Classrooms were full of kids. Ten separate classrooms. No way nobody didn't hear something. Which gets rid of the kidnapping charge right there. But that's still not enough to reopen the case, is it? No, it's not. I don't understand, Justin. No, it's just... It's something Brian said. It was, uh... I mean, we all know the system's broken. Which is why you started this place. I know, but I just don't wanna ever stop trying because the system has conditioned us to stop trying. Go home. Come on. You visited this hallway. Go visit your family. Yeah. Since when did you become interested in art museums? You remember that trainer I told you about, Karina. So, she's an artist? Yeah. Yeah, she just sent me this. Check it out. Baby, she painted this? Yup. So, you want to take her to the museum? Just to thank her for all the free training sessions. But there's some special exhibit going on right now and the ticket prices are crazy. I don't... Get the tickets, baby. Oh, Ma, come on. Look, I know things are tight right now. I mean, barely made the car payment last month. The car payment can wait. Your happiness can't. Brian, you deserve happiness. Not shame, not guilt. Happiness. Thanks, Mom. Oh... Thanks. What is it? Reminds me of something someone taught me once. - Um, I gotta take this. - Yeah. - I'll be right back. - Okay. - This is Brian. - What the hell are you doing, Banks? 2,000 feet, remember? - What? - Look out the window. Look out the goddamn window. Does that look like 2,000 feet? Get out of there now! What the... Is everything okay? I can't be here. - Okay. - I'm sorry, I should have checked. I just got so excited with the art and, you know... But hey, I got a chance to see your kind of art. Right? Would you mind if I showed you mine? Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, let's go. - Okay. - Yeah. Wow! Brian, this is some canvas. I remember going to my first USC game when I was 15. I went with my mom and my brother Brandon. I was sitting right up there. Section 6, seat 14. The best part wasn't even the game. The best part was just watching my mom be so happy because I was so happy. Hey, uh... I'm... I'm sorry about today, Karina. I didn't even know what it meant when I took that plea. All I knew was that I just didn't want to spend the rest of my life in jail. My cousin went to prison. And when he came out, he just wasn't the same. And you were what, 16? How did you survive it? Almost didn't. Especially in the beginning. Then I met a man who showed me a different way, and everything changed. Two men look out from prison bars. One saw mud, the other, the stars. Perspective, gentlemen. Perspective is the key to how one fares in life. Mr. Banks, what do you think? I don't think none of this shit apply to me. Then you need this class more than most. Thank you, gentlemen. Mr. Banks. Brian. I know you think football is the pathway to happiness. But on my life, son, I promise you that it is not. The path to happiness begins and ends in the mind. Free your mind, Brian, and your ass will follow. Before him, all I could think was, "Why me?" All right, look. I don't know exactly what it is you're going through, but you've got to let it go or it's gonna pull you down. How you got here may be wrong, but the fact is, you are here. And before you leave this place physically, you must leave it mentally, or you'll be back. This is for you. I might give you more books from time to time. Books I hope you'll read. I wish I could say I got it from the start, but... I was scared. Scared my life was over. Then this dude, doesn't know nothing about me, he's talking about helping me? Was this the kind of help that my lawyer gave me? So, yeah, I was skeptical. And right when I'm trying to understand everything he's teaching me, I get transferred. Didn't see him again. That's when prison had its own ideas. What's up, homie? You got a problem, bitch? No, I ain't got no problem. B87. Gate's open. In prison, it's the not knowing that gets to you. Not knowing what's on the other side of a door. Not knowing if you'll make it out alive. What's up, homie? Sometimes you gotta walk deeper into the darkness to find the light. Hey, Banks, get up! Let's go! Up! Now! You broke his jaw, Banks. Don't you ever want to get out of here? Sixty days. Think about it. That was solitary for me. I don't even feel you no more, God. I can't feel you. Brian, we need you back in the game. Hey, you think they give a shit about you? About how twisted up and pissed off you are? They don't even remember your name. Shit. Brian. You've got to let it go. You've got to let it all go, or it's going to pull you down. All you can control in life... This is for you. Is how you respond to life. It's strange. I didn't see Mr. Johnson after that first year in juvie. But he's been with me every day since. Listen, I... I want to be honest with you. I, um... I told you I put off grad school, but I didn't say why. Why I reacted when I heard your story. I... I didn't have the best experience in college and... Um... Who was he? A friend... I thought. Uh... He said he couldn't remember me saying no. Said I could have gotten those bruises from anywhere. The cops were like, "Sure you're not overreacting?" And when the school... did nothing... I left. I'm sorry. I... I don't even know how you can hang with me after hearing my story. Well, I couldn't at first. But then I got to know you. No. Can't do that. Can't do that. Here he comes, and that'll be a first down. Whoo! That's the way to freaking pass, baby! Yeah, baby! And Coach Pete Carroll calls another time-out. I gotta tell you, when it comes to Coach Carroll, there's no quit in him. The players believe in him, they believe in the system. He brings a lot of energy to the team. And I think Carroll coming on to the Seahawks is the best decision they could have made. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. "Bygones be..." Hello? Hello? Kennisha? Hey. Hey. So, um... I... I guess I'm still wondering why you'd send me a friend request like that. Yeah. I wasn't even sure you would answer. So, I was just looking through people I know from high school. I saw your page. And I was like, you look good. But I was thinking maybe we could, I don't know, hang out or something? Hang... Hang out? Can you understand why that might seem a little weird to me that you'd want to do that? I was in prison. I can't work. I can't play football. Things have been pretty tough for me, Kennisha. So, I guess that mean you ain't trying to hang out, then? Uh, well... Well, maybe we could. Yeah, maybe we could. Truth is, I'm just stuck. And you're the only one who can help me get unstuck. I mean, you're the only other one who knows what really happened. And if you did help me, then... we would never have to talk about this stuff again. All right, well... what is it you need me to do? Brian, if they find out you went anywhere near that girl, they'll send you right back to prison. That's why nobody's gonna find out. Please, let's think about this some more. You only have ten months left on your parole. But I'm still gonna be on that damn list. Nobody's gonna ever hire me if I don't clear my name. - Well, then let the attorneys handle this. - My attorneys... What... What attorneys, Ma? Who? The CIP? I ain't heard from them in weeks. Besides, Kennisha already said she ain't going nowhere near a lawyer. The only person she agreed to talk to is Corey's friend. You remember Corey from the gym. So, look, he's got a friend. Been selling insurance for a little bit, but he's starting up his own PI firm. So we all got together, we got a plan. Trust me. We got a plan. An insurance agent, Brian? Mom, Mom. Sometimes things come your way and you have to act on them right then and there or else you won't have another chance. This is my chance. Okay? Brian. Hey. I wasn't sure if this was the right place. You found it. I was nervous about coming. Yeah, shit, I've been kind of nervous myself. Did I tell you I got three little ones now? Oh, you got three kids? Yeah. But it's some drama going on with all that. So that's why I told you I don't want to talk to no lawyers. Oh, no, this guy's not... He's not a lawyer. He's more like an adviser. So... - So, Ms. Reed... - Rice. Oh, I'm sorry. Ms. Rice, I understand from Brian there are some things that you guys wanted to discuss? Yeah. Uh... Well, we wanted to talk to you about what happened in 2002. Okay. Uh, Ms. Rice, is that what you want to do? I guess so. I mean, Brian ain't playing in the NFL right now, I guess that's 'cause of me. So, you want to help him. Well, I can't do nothing where I gotta, like, pay back none of the money or anything. I mean, that would take a long time. Okay, and I understand. Look, this is just for my own education so that I can... offer advice. Now, take me back to the incident in 2002 and just tell me how you see it. Um... Well, I guess the way I look at it is, we was just being young. Curious about things. Okay, so you're saying that he never raped you? I don't like using that word. Well, then tell me what happened. Well, after we was down there and he went out the door and I went my way, there was this security guard. Hey! You know I saw you with that boy. Y'all went in the 700 building, didn't you? I know what you kids do in there. Yeah, well, it wasn't my idea. - Whose was it? - His. Oh! So, you're saying he made you go in there? Made you do stuff? So, if that's true, you're saying he raped you. Is that what you're saying? So, I wasn't the first person to use that word. Uh, so the security guard said it first? And then you wrote it down on a piece of paper and gave it to your friend? Mm-hmm. Okay. Did you tell any of these people that you and Brian were just kissing and heavy petting and that you didn't actually have sex? Nobody was listening to anything I had to say. I mean, my attorney was like, "Just don't say nothing. Like, don't talk at all. Just let them do what they're gonna do." Okay, so, to be clear... Brian never raped you? No, he did not rape me. Did he kidnap you? Never. Alissa. To be clear, Brian never raped you? No, he did not rape me. Did he kidnap you? Never. Amazing. A full recantation on tape. So, and she knew, right? This guy told her she was being taped? Uh, no. No. No, but... he did have a sign on the wall that said the room was being monitored. A sign on the wall, that's it? Justin. This is what you said I needed. Something extraordinary. This is what I brought you. Kennisha telling the truth. She's telling the truth. It's amazing, Brian. It really is. I've... I've never seen anything like it. But it's also... It's inadmissible. You can't use it. You can't record somebody in the State of California without their explicit consent. Come on. We got her sitting there right on tape, telling the truth. You're telling me I can't show anybody? What do you think the chances are of getting her to say it again on the record? No chance! PI already scared her off by trying to get her to sign something at the end. Once she knows she perjured herself and could lose the money, she's gonna recant her recantation. Yeah. Brian, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I... I wish you'd have called us before you reached out. You wish I would have called you? You wish I would have called you? You know why I didn't call you, Justin? Because every time I throw you a pass, you bat it down, - just like you're doing now. - That's not what we're doing. Coming at me with all these... these legal excuses about the system. About how the truth doesn't matter. The truth matters! I know it matters. I know that. Okay? And that tape is... extraordinary. I agree. But... - I can't do anything legally... - Okay, okay. Stop. Okay? You know what, man? You know, forget the tape. Okay? You want extraordinary? I'll tell you what's extraordinary about this case. I am. It's extraordinary that I'm still here. That I'm still standing. You ever been in prison? I'm not talking about to visit one of your clients. You ever been locked up? I spent my 17th birthday and the 60 days after that in solitary confinement. It nearly killed me. And the only reason it didn't is because something happened to me. Something extraordinary. Someone extraordinary. I've done... everything I can on my own... to get myself free. There's only one other person who can get me the rest of the way, and that's you. So, I'm begging you. Forget all the rules. Forget all the reasons. Forget all the roadblocks they put in our way. I know the system doesn't care about me, Justin. I know. But I know you do. Help set me free. Okay. Okay. Right. Okay. Brian Banks lost ten years of his life. We have ten months to clear his name. Why? Because the habeas petition will only be considered while you're still under state supervision. That's right. If we can't get this thing overturned within ten months before his parole runs out, he's guilty the rest of his life. 99% of all habeas petitions get rejected, so just getting the DA to pay attention to this is gonna be tough. Hey, Barbara. Justin Brooks again. Hey, is Rafael in? He'll have to get back to you, Mr. Brooks. All right. As soon as he can, please. Thank you. So while I'm trying to force him to pay attention, Alissa will put together a new petition, while, Marilyn, you try to track down Kennisha Rice and get her on the record this time. Now, just remember, and this is critical, if the court doesn't schedule us ASAP, Brian's gonna run out of time. Brian's the same age as some of you. He should have gone to college by now. He should be playing in the NFL. Hey, we found Mateo. He's on the Loller case, LA Superior. And the reason he isn't is not just because a girl lied, it's because the system didn't care about the truth in the first place. Well, in the words of somebody I greatly admire, "Fuck the system." - It was a good day. - Yeah. Well, if it isn't our elusive district attorney. - Mr. Brooks. - How you doing, Rafael? I've been looking for you. Aren't we seeing each other for Leftowich in three weeks? This can't wait three weeks. I'm representing Brian Banks. Falsely accused of rape. The girl's recanted her story. We got it all on tape. Let me guess. You want me to take a look at it. I want you to meet Brian Banks. He's an amazing kid. Could have played pro ball. I'm telling you, Rafael, this is gonna blow up. Media's gonna be all over it. Chance for you to jump in and control the spin. You are the master spinner, aren't you, Mr. Brooks? Well, I'm a lawyer, so... it's redundant. Come on, Rafael. Kid's different. Have your client here in 90 minutes. Otherwise, he waits in line like everyone else. Hey, Justin. You got a jacket and a tie? I look okay? Ain't nothing okay about the way you look. Now, go. Please do not tell me this is another bad decision. I'm gonna start calling you Bad Decision Banks. - But... I-I have a job interview, sir. - Oh, yeah? Like the one in San Diego when you were meeting with that lawyer? I got my sources. Give me the keys, Banks. - Sir, I-I really have... - Give me the goddamn keys, Banks. Yeah, I got him. Where's your guy? Hey! Hey, he's coming. He's just... Let me get you a cup of coffee. Nice try, Mr. Brooks. Time's up. Nobody from the DA's office ever visited the crime scene. I did. I saw where this girl claimed she was dragged down a hallway lined with open classrooms full of students, and forcibly raped. Nobody saw it. Nobody heard it. Hey, you think the brass is gonna wonder why you and your investigators never checked this place out? Sir, this is my mom's car. My mom. There aren't any drugs in there, I swear. Good. So, you have nothing to worry about. Now, why you going to LA? You know you can't take a job outside the district. The job's local. Corporate headquarters are in LA. Car's clean. You better not be lying to me, Banks. Straight there, straight back. 'Cause if you so much as pull over to piss, you'll be back behind bars. Where are you? Yeah, no... I'm on my way. My PO was busting my ass. I'm... I'll be there. Hey! Sorry, man. Save it for the DA. Mateo's in a mood. All right. Mr. Brooks says you filed the habeas petition yourself. Yes, sir. Read the California Appeals Code while I was in prison. Why do you think she lied, Mr. Banks? She was a 15-year-old girl with her whole life ahead of her. Why would she lie? I've asked myself that a thousand times. Maybe it was the money. Maybe I hurt her feelings. But with all due respect, sir, I don't know why it's my responsibility to explain why she lied. The fact is, she did. Her testimony changed every time. Mine never did. Mr. Mateo, I don't wish any ill will towards Kennisha. I just want a chance to turn all this negativity into something positive. - Has she gone on the record? - No. We're kind of having a hard time tracking her down. I need to speak with her. I won't recommend reversing any conviction until I interview the victim myself. Tell me we're getting close. Absolutely. You did great in there. You just got to get her to show up. - What does that mean? - It's not gonna be easy. If the state finds out she lied, she could lose the whole settlement. - The 1.5. - But Kennisha doesn't know that. There ain't no way she told her mom she flipped. I know, but I've seen this sort of thing before. Witnesses, - they stay hidden unless... - Unless? No. No, no, no, Brian, you can't. I can't... I can't what? I've gone to reporters before to help me find a witness or get them to talk. Sometimes, when you go public, people want to defend themselves. - Then that's what we do. - Listen to me, Brian. Your PO finds out that you contacted Kennisha, you could go right back to jail. I told you. I'm already in jail. This is Mike. Hey, Mr. Paley, uh, this is Brian Banks. 26-year-old Brian Banks, who once had dreams of the NFL, is now fighting to clear his name. His football dreams ended at the age of 16 when he was accused of a crime he claims he didn't commit. To be clear, Brian never raped you? No, he did not rape me. Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Is the district attorney reopening the case? Brian, any more word from Kennisha? Do you think you'll get another shot at the NFL? Hey, first I gotta get my day in court. All right? - Yeah. - It worked, Brian. The mother surfaced. She called the district attorney's office. - Had a whole shit-fit. - Okay. So, Mateo issued a subpoena. He threatened to call the school district, turn over all the evidence unless they show. So, now we're close, Brian. We're really close. Okay, thanks, Justin. Yeah. Contacting the victim. Recording her without her consent. Lying to your PO about job interviews. That's three strikes, right there. Now, look, I know you saw it. And you heard her say I didn't do it because I didn't do it. Now, if someone put that on you, you would have done the same thing. No, wrong. Don't tell me what I'd do, Banks. You and I ain't the same. Do you even know what the word "credibility" means? You have no credibility when you lie to me to prove that someone lied about you. That is in direct violation of your parole under the law. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Yes, sir, I hear you. It is my duty to report your violations. And I plan to obey that duty. In time. Law says I have to report it. It just doesn't say when. I'm gonna give you eight weeks, till your parole is up. If, in that time, they do not overturn your conviction, you won't just be a registered sex offender. You'll be a prisoner again. Mr. Brooks, where is this witness? Your Honor, uh, we respectfully ask the court to just indulge us with a little more time. She's half an hour late. You think this is the only hearing on the docket? Issue another subpoena and reschedule the hearing. Adjourned. Come on, Rafael. Can't you work with me a little bit? I mean, there's no time for another hearing. Brian's parole is gonna run out. Then it's over. He's done. You know that. I need a statement from the complainant on the record. A statement that casts doubt on her original testimony. Now, you know that. Justin, that's her mom. That's her. Ms. Rice. Ms. Rice. Now, who the hell are y'all? I'm District Attorney Rafael Mateo, ma'am. You're in the right place. - Are you Kennisha? - Yeah, that's her. Look, the only reason why we came down here is to clear up all this bullshit. We want to clear this up too, ma'am. So, maybe we can all sit down and have a talk. So, Kennisha, this won't take long. - We have some questions. - This all you need to know. That boy out there, he raped my daughter. End of story. All that other shit on TV he forced her to say. He offered her $10,000. Kennisha, you told our investigator that Brian offered you $20,000. Mama, can you take him out of here, please? Just say what you said the first time in court. Come on. I'm not gonna answer none of y'all's stupid questions. - Ms. Rice, I just need... - I said I'm not answering them! What if I make my best effort to not ask any stupid questions? They're all stupid, if you ask me. Well, my name is Justin Brooks and I run the California Innocence Project. We get thousands of requests every year for people to represent them. And Kennisha, if Brian Banks raped you, I don't want to represent him. - He did rape me. - Okay. Okay. Well, if you can just get me to accept that and clear up a few of these inconsistencies, we can all move on here. Okay? I just want to talk to you briefly about the incident in July of 2002. When you went into that stairwell with Brian, what did you think was gonna happen? I don't know. I was young at the time. Right. At the top of the stairwell, there are classrooms. - School was in session. - Mm-hmm. So, why didn't you just shout out to anybody? 'Cause I didn't know he was gonna do it. When we first went down there, I thought he was just gonna touch. You know, touchy-feely. So, Ms. Rice, are you saying that you initially went down there willingly? No. You putting words in my mouth. You just said, "When we first went down there, I thought it was gonna be touchy-feely." You didn't say that he forced or dragged you. There you go again with them stupid questions. Brian know he did it. If he was so innocent, he would have took it to trial and won. Kennisha, don't you think anybody's ever been coerced into taking a plea before? I mean, maybe Brian just felt trapped. But listen, we all make mistakes, especially when we're young. We... We say things we regret. Isn't it possible that maybe you said some things back then that you didn't mean? Kennisha, did Brian ever coerce you or pay you to talk to him? He ain't got no money. Right. So you reached out to him on your Facebook page yourself to help him, right? That was nice. Because you know you didn't have sex with him in that stairwell. You know that. You guys went down there to make out. And then Brian... you know, he may have embarrassed you a little bit that day, right? Maybe because he didn't want to go through with it. I understand, and you liked him. You liked him a lot. It's okay. Yeah, y'all started it, but we gonna finish it. You... Kennisha, what you said on the tape the other day, if it's true, Brian can get his life back. You can help him get a job. - He can move on with his life. - What the hell is taking so long in here? Oh, did you tell them the truth this time? Or they got you in here making up some other story? What about my life? I go on with my life? Can I get my virginity back? Ms. Rice, I just need... I ain't talking to you no more. You a smartass. Just... Let's take a break, and we'll just - come back here in a moment. - I'm not coming back! I'm never coming back. I'm done talking to y'all. I'm done. I'm not talking no more! - Ms. Rice, we have to... - No. You heard her. Talking's over. Let's go. She admitted it was consensual. She said it started consensually... Which eliminates the kidnapping charge. You said you needed something on the record that would cast doubt on her original testimony. Didn't you just get that? All I can do is recommend that the same judge who put Brian away overturn this. And you know the chances of that. Don't let that stop you. Do you have a child, Mr. Mateo? Can you imagine what it's like seeing that child, that innocent child, taken from you and locked away with men who have done real crimes and can do real harm to him? All a mother ever wants is to protect her children. And I was never ever able to do that for my boy. I'll go to my grave feeling the pain of that past. But you can do something today, Mr. Mateo, to stop the pain of his future. Now, that judge, he will listen to you. You know he will, if you believe in your heart that what was done to my son was wrong. All rise. Be seated. Okay, People vs. Banks. I have before me a petition for writ of habeas corpus, petition of error coram nobis to overturn the original judgment. So... do the petitioners wish to say anything? Yes, thank you, Your Honor. Brian Banks was 16 years old when he was accused of a crime he did not commit. He lost 11 years of his young life. A scholarship. He was prevented from playing football, a game that he loves. And I think we have to ask why. Was it the system that failed him? Nobody has been more critical of this system than I have. But I've come to realize, maybe it's not the system. Maybe it's us. All of us. Maybe it's me. Yes, we have laws. But those laws can be interpreted. There is just enough flexibility to allow for some amount of choice. And with that choice comes the power to do right. To choose justice over expediency, and the truth over a technicality. And the truth is, Brian Banks is innocent. Eleven years, Your Honor. Eleven years my client will never get back. Eleven years his family has had to suffer. Eleven years of dreams deferred. And we can fix it. We can rectify it all here today. You know, most of the time, I'm just trying to get my client their lives back. In Brian Banks' case, we have a chance to give him his dreams back. Please don't deny him that chance. Thank you. And the People? The People will concede the matter, Your Honor, and ask the court to grant the petition for exoneration. All right, then. The petition is granted. Brian. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for not giving up, for making sure I didn't either. - Well done, Brooks. - Thank you. Brian! - Brian! - Brian! Brian, tell us how you're feeling. - Do you plan to sue? - Are you angry at the situation? No. At some point, you gotta let all that go. All I ever wanted was my freedom, and we got that here today. Two! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hello? Hey, I'm looking for a linebacker. Know where I might find any? Coach Carroll. It was good to see you on TV the other day. How are you, old friend? Oh, I'm on top of the world, Coach. How you doing? I'm doing pretty well up here in Seattle. I'm so sorry you had to go to hell and back, Brian, but wanted to ask you. Think you may want to come up here and try out for the Seahawks? Oh, most definitely, Coach. Most definitely. All right. I need you on the plane first thing Monday morning. Yeah. Thanks.
