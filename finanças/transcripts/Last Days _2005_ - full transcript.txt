We could probably go over to, uh... Vanessa and Page's house. He might be sleeping on their couch. - Who are they? - Just some kind of girlfriends that we all have. Like, hang out kind of... just mutual friends. So Vanessa and Page are both women? - Yeah. - Yeah. For every... for every thought of good... for every thought of good that my death... will benefit. I... Iost... something... on my way. I lost something on my way... to... wherever... I am today. I remember... when... I remember... when... I remember... when... Are you okay? - Who's that? - Yeah, right. - That isn't... - Hey, girlie. Oh, man. - Who is it? - That isn't Donovan. Yeah, it is. Fucking motherfucker. - I'd like to kick his ass. - Oh, yeah. - Fucking asshole. - Scumbag. Fucking dickhead Don. I cannot believe that wuss. Who the fuck is that with him? - I have no idea. - Oh, God. Hey, Blake! Blake! It's me, Donovan. Blake? Hey, Blake! Blake? Blake? Yeah! Yeah! Hey, you. Hey. Are you free? Sort of. Free enough to play that guitar? Yeah. I haven't been playing very much. Have you talked to your daughter, hm? I have been talking to her on the phone. What do you say to her? I do the voices she likes, you know. I tell her I miss her. Do you say "I'm sorry that I'm a... rock and roll clich?"? Hmm. Are you writing all that down? Do you want something to drink? Something... No no. I have a car waiting, and I want you to come with me. I really can't. I got, uh... I don't know. There's stuff that I gotta get done. You have to come now. You can go. You can get out of here. No one's here. You can go. It'd be easy. If you stay here, you're just gonna... Oh. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. I'm sorry. You're not wearing a bra? Come on. Come on, come on. Mama Mama Mama. Oh, shit. I love it, I love it. Ouch! You okay? There was this lyric in the bridge that I was trying to figure out, and I've been having trouble figuring it out 'cause it's... like, I want it to be more personal, and it's just sort of... I'm not getting there. And I was wondering if you could maybe, like, help me... help me figure it out a little... Leave him the fuck alone and come upstairs with me, all right? Oh. - Hmm. - I'm sorry, I'm talking your ear off. I didn't ask. You know? Luke... Lukas, I've gotta get out of here, man. Why? Why? That ranger, the cop. He's not a real cop. He's not a ranger. He's not "Walker, Texas Ranger." He's a private eye. Well, what do you mean? He's not real, but she's probably coming back. - Herself? - Yeah. You fucking bug him - every time you talk to him about... - Really? ...the demo tape. - I'm not bugging. He doesn't wanna help you, he just saying that to... to get you to leave him alone, man. Is that what you think? - You really think that? - I know that, man. - Well, thanks. Thanks a lot, then. - Sorry. You gotta leave him alone. C'mere. Forget about the demo. Forget about the demo. Asshole. #Flies through the last... # I need some contact with her. You know, it's not... everyone... I'm being treated like I'm a... like I'm a... fucking criminal, you know? I don't... I don't like... I don't wanna put it in the... Hey, Blake! Blake! It's me, Donovan. Blake? Blake? Blake? Blake? You know, I used to work for the forest service in the summer. Hey, bro? Blake? Hey, Blake? Blake? Blake? Wanna shoot some craps? Look at this. Look how it's starting to crystallize. This is cellulous nitrate, same stuff as film stock. This is eventually gonna implode. Completely crystallize and implode. What do you suppose is over there? Oh, yeah. That over there... that, that's... that's the greenhouse, where they keep the garden tools and stuff. I'm your boyfriend. No. Oh, Christ. Oh, whatever you want it to be, sir. A package of artificial cheese with your... macaroni and cheese. Hey, Blake. Can I have your attention, man? There's something I really gotta talk to you about. You know, I've been... I've been stuck here for a week with... with no apples and... and you know how I got fucked up on that airplane going to Portland? And I threatened to pee on the... on the stewardess? - Mm-hm. - And they diverted the flight? - Hmm. - I have... I have to go to Utah, man, and I don't have any money. - Hmm. - And... it's colder than shit in this house. I was watching football last night, they have these... they have these... these jet heaters. They're like jet engines. They can probably... they could heat this whole place. - Mm-hm. - I mean, it sounds like a good idea to me. - Hmm. - So I need... I need to go to Utah and I need, uh... we need a jet heater. Hmm. Ouch! You okay? Blake. Here's that... that demo tape I was... - I was gonna give you. - Mmm. It's... I recorded it on the four track... upstairs. But... there's this one... one of the songs is a song about... this girl... when I was touring in Japan, and uh... I was... we were... it was the last night of the tour in Tokyo. She was... she gave me this card at the end of... at the end of the tour. I mean, at the... like, at the after party. And she drew little tits on it and gave me her number, and I called her that night at 12:00 or something. And she came right over, and we, like... we had sex. And... and she was like... her body was unbelievable. She was just so beautiful. I think she was like a star, like a music and like TV star or something. And like... and so l... she kept calling me. Well, so... so we had sex and it was probably the best sex I ever had in my whole life. And then, uh... then I left the next day back to America and... and, uh, she kept calling me and she wanted to come visit me and, uh, I didn't... I never called her back, and I felt really bad about it. So I wrote this song... that's one... that's the song... one of the songs on that tape. And there's... there's... I wanna make it as personal as I can like, I wa... I wanna apologize to her, you know? - Hmm. - I was sort of... I actually was wondering if you could help me with some of the lyrics on it 'cause there's... there's this one part in the song on the bridge where... where I don't know exactly how to put what I'm trying to say. It's like I wanna do it more... Leave him the fuck alone and come upstairs with me, all right? Oh. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm talking your ear off. I just wasn't thinking, man, you know? - Hmm? - I'll see you. I'll listen to it. Listen to it, yeah. Tell me what you think. Hmm. Hey. What's going on, man? How are you doing? How are you? L... I missed you Thursday. We tried to get in touch 'cause l... I went to this... because... this, uh... I fucking hate talking here. We went to the Dead... uh, to a Dead show and it was like at least about 2-300,000 people, but that's not even the... the point is that afterwards we played "Dungeons and Dragons." We played that "D&D" game with Jerry, and Jerry was like the best dungeon master. We captured the winged Pegasus. And his girlfriend... Suzette or Jacquette, some French name... she was like... she did these voodoo rituals. She gave us, uh... Now it's only half a jaw, but before it was a whole jaw. And... it's something about virility, but I know you weren't feeling... you're not feeling that great, so if you want the bottom jaw, I could give you the bottom jaw, like... I could give you the jaw... at least. It works. We're coming, we're coming. Where did Asia go? - Hey, Nicole. - What? Give me your hand. We were just three... guys. - No, we're not three guys. - No, we're not - three guys. - We were just two guys and a girl. Going, leaving for no particular reason. Why... why are we leaving, Scott? Oh, yeah. Why are we leaving, Scott? - Where are we going? - Nobody knows - where we're going. - To my place? Yep. That's right. Sorry. ...of Blake were so excruciatingly painful that he sometimes wanted to die or kill himself. Do you think this is a contributing thing here? I mean, do you think he was exaggerating in saying that? - No, I don't think... - No, I know. I actually spoke to his mother about this. - She had an identical... - I understand. ...situation uh, at about his age... - I understand. Okay. We're fucked. We're gonna be implicated and tied up in this whole thing. They're gonna accuse us of copping for Blake. And they're gonna say we were there. Do we need to get out of here? I don't have anything. I don't have any of my stuff ready. This is giving me the creeps. Do we need anything? Can we just go? - Let's just get the fuck out of here. - Let's just go. Where are we gonna go? We'll go to Los Angeles. Fuck. Are you all right?
