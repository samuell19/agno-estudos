Joanna. Yeah? It's almost 7:00. Oh, you're kidding me. I will be right out. Morning. Hey. Mmm. So, tonight's going to be a big night, huh? Yeah. As far as I know, everybody's coming. Oh... So what do you think? For the next one, should we, uh... Should we rent out a restaurant? Oh, sure. And leave me with nothing to do? I don't think so. Hmm. Oh, honey, I forgot to tell you last night there was a message on the machine from that teen care center. Someone named Dana. Kelly? Yeah, she called and said she's sorry that you had to cancel the interview, but she wanted you to call her and set up an appointment. I think she wants to meet you at 3:00 tomorrow. Okay. Thanks. Mindy. Good morning. Hi, Mom. Hi, beauty. Come on. Time to get up. Oh, I know. Good morning, sweetie. Morning, Holly. Oh... Come here, sweetie. Did you have sweet dreams, huh? Oh, sweet thing. Huh, did you have good dreams? Uh-huh. I dreamed there was a little white puppy with black ears in bed with me, Mommy. She saw that stupid dog in a dog food commercial. I did not. I saw him right across the street at Mrs. Palmer's. She even let me pet him. So, just shut up. No, you shut up. Okay, let's stop shutting up. Come on, let's go. Come here, come here, come here. Only half a day today. Yes! Morning, Joanna. Hi. You all set for tonight? Oh, well, I'm getting there. Thanks again for picking up the girls for me today. Bye, Mommy. I love you, sweetheart. Are you sure you don't want me to come by and give you a hand? I mean, even Martha Stewart needs a little help. Well, I've got Mina for half a day. And then my mother's coming early, so I should be okay. Thanks. Bye. See you later. Now, wait. Don't forget. You wait for Patty to pick you up, okay? Okay. You stay inside until you do see her. She'll drop you off a little bit later. That way Mommy gets a chance to get some things done. Have a great day. Bye, doll. Sweetie... Sweetie. You dropped something. I'll sign for that. Thank you. Can I get a copy of that? Oh! Oh, yeah. Could you put them in the back seat? Mmm-hmm. Thanks. Thank you. Hello. Hi. I heard it was going to rain today. I thought we might have to go inside. But look at it! I would have hated that. I know. Why break tradition? Would you like something to drink, Mrs. Kendall? How about some wine? Come on, once in a while won't kill you. Today? Mmm-hmm. Are you kidding me? I still have to drive out to Burt's. Pick up the fresh fruit, drive back, dress my kids, make the fruit boat, set up the tables. And she'd like to see me do it all sloshed. Club soda and lime, please. Oh, please. Your parties are always great. You got the hostess gene. Face it, some of us are blessed. The rest of us know good caterers. I shouldn't be drinking today, either. I figured I'd try to finish A Doll's House. Why are we in a book club and reading a play? Maybe we should start calling ourselves a play club. So, have you read it yet? No, no. I've been too busy getting ready with the job... Oh, that's right, the job interview! How did it go? Well, it didn't yet. Nancy, I really want to get back to work. I liked it. I want to see if I can still do it. Especially now, with the girls being older, but... I don't know, I'm... I guess I'm scared. I haven't been on a job interview in 11 years. Last time I worked in an office, Internet was some kind of hair spray. Well, don't look at me. I am perfectly happy with my life. Joanna, you have nothing to prove. You have terrific kids. You got a great house, a fabulous husband. Your life is perfect. Come on, nothing's perfect. scattered showers throughout most of Hayden county, clearing by mid-after... Damn it. Got 'em. No! God! Oh, no! Honey, are you all right? Oh, God. Honey. Honey. Oh! Oh, sweetheart. Oh, my God! Oh, you're going to be okay. I'll get you... I'll get you to the hospital. Come on... Come on. Oh... Oh, no. Maybe I shouldn't move you. Help! I can't move you. I'm going to go get help. I'm going to call and get help, honey. I'm gonna get you to the hospital. You'll be all right. Oh, God. Sweetie, I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'm going to go get some help. Come on, work. Just work. Hello? 9-1-1, do you have an emergency? Hello? Yes, yes. Please give me your name. There's been an accident. Where is it? There's been an accident on... On Kensington Road, near Hampton. What? Please repeat that for me. There's a little girl and she's hurt. She's really hurt. Where on Kensington, ma'am? On Hampton road. Um, uh, between... Between Green Leaf and Hampton on Kensington. What is the nature of the accident? Just send an ambulance please. She's hurt. I have to... I have to get back! I have to get back. Oh, God. Hey, what happened? What's going on? Someone just hit a little girl! Son of a bitch just left her. Oh, my God, is she going to be okay? She's alive but she's unconscious. What the hell is wrong with people, leaving a child like that? What the hell is wrong with people? Clear the area. Let's make it roll. Hey, whose car is this? Come on, get in, let's go, roll it. It's mine, sir. No! Don't even think about it. Get back in your car. Keep going. But, I... Clear the area. Do us all a favor. Come on, please. Come on, come on, go, go, go! Move it. That's it. - Keep goin'. - Okay. Come on, lady. Oh, my God. - Let's go! - Come on, move! Come on! Let's move that SUV out of there! Let's go! Come on, lady. Let's go, let's go! Move! Move! - But I... - Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Hayden Memorial Hospital. Hi, I want to find out some information about a little girl. She was probably brought into emergency. Do you have the patient's name? No. No, I don't know her name. It wasn't that long ago. Hey, Mom, be right down! I'll call you back. Hi, sweetie. Hi, Mom. Hi. Mom, I had an idea. I figured that you could get me a puppy like Mrs. Palmer's for my birthday. A white puppy with black ears. Oh... Mommy, you're wet. Holly, I told you not to eat when you use my computer. You got crumbs all between the letters, you idiot. I did not. You're an idiot. Hello. Hi, it's me. Hold on a second. No, Doug, that's okay. Listen, I need to talk to you. Well, can't Bob handle it? Okay. No, no, I really... I need to talk to you. I need you to come home. It has to be in person, I have... Honey, I'm comin' home early anyway. I'll be there at 4:00. Okay, 4:00. Please. Now, you promise? Just hurry. Promise. Hurry. I love you, honey. Okay. Hayden county sheriff's. Yes. Hey, babe. Don't tell me, 99.2? Better. Point five. Maybe you're sick. Oh, I am feeling mighty healthy. Uh-uh, no. Mmm-mmm. What? Where? Okay, give me 20. So much for a mid-day rendezvous. Oh, John, sweetie-pie. I got about five minutes to spare. Come on, we can do this... No, no, no way. Please? 99.5, when am I ever going to hit that again? This really sucks. You know if you'd just go and get your sperm counted, we wouldn't... Look, look. This is the last time I'm going to say it. Now, I'm not going into some little room and look at dirty pictures and then do it into a jar so that some beady-eyed little lab guy can count my boys. It will happen the normal way. It will just take a little bit longer, that's all. How long? Till hell freezes over? Till the cows come home? So, what is it? Hit and run, a kid. Where? Eaton. Eaton? Yeah, Eaton. Really? Welcome to the lifestyles of the rich and reckless. Maybe I should wear my Gucci uniform. And I imagine you'll be setting up a separate table for the children's food? No. Thank you. Really? I don't usually do that, Mother. Oh, well... Thank you. Well, I know, Joanna, but it seems like there are going to be many more children this evening than usual. Don't tell me you didn't take that into consideration. Mother, have you seen the cumin? I just bought a whole big container of it, and I... Darling, if you would just put things in their proper places the moment you come home. I got it, never mind. Thank you. I got... Oh, that looks good. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Oh... Damn it. Joanna. My goodness, relax. Honey, I told you before I came to help you. Well, I just don't think you can help me with what I need help with right now, Mother. What do you need help with? Hello. Hello. Hey. Hey, honey. Hi. - Hi, Betty. - Hi. I am so sorry I'm late. Right as I'm walking out of the office, Bob stops me, corners me, and wants to talk to me about some numbers on the Jerry Ross account. Doug, please. I really need to talk to you. One second, honey, all I want to do, I just want to take the vodka and put it in the freezer, okay? Hey, you guys hear about that accident? What accident? Right over here on Kensington, hit and run. Somebody hit a little girl and drove off. Jim down at the liquor store was telling me. Good Lord. Do you think she's going to be all right? I don't know. Actually, I think he said she's in a coma. Can I please talk to you? I'm coming, I'm coming. It wasn't one of the neighborhood children? You know what, I think he said her name was Corey. Kitty Corey, uh, Kelly Corey. I know Kelly Corey. She's in Mrs. Oaken's class. What happened to her? Hey. Hey, sweetie, how you doing? Okay. Hey, honey. Did you guys have a good day? Yeah. Well, she was, um... She was riding her bike and someone accidentally hit her with a car. And now she's in the hospital. Who did it? I don't know. The, uh... The person drove away. Why'd they drive away? Do you remember when I told you guys how most people were good, but there was some bad people in the world, too, and sometimes these bad people do really terrible things? Yeah. Well, that's what happened, okay? Maybe the person got scared and ran away. From this point down, about 30 feet there. - All right. Hey, Rico. Hey, Mike. What do we got? Vic's name is Kelly Corey, eight years old. Here you go. Cute little thing. She was riding her bike to her friend's house. Got caught in the rain. How is she? Coma. Could go either way. Hey, where was that? Under her head when we got here. Under her head? Who put it there? I don't know, exactly. Just make sure it's checked for prints, okay? Thanks. We'll get the lab reports on that. Hmm... I want casts of all these prints. Of all of them? Yeah. There are at least 15 prints there. No, I'd say more like 20. You heard her. Hey, Briggs, come here. Look at this. Looks like somebody took a little walk up this way, huh? Then turned around and went back to the kid. Hey, you got names of everybody that was here, right? Cops, EMT's, witnesses? Yeah. I think so. Okay, contact all of them. I want to know what kind of shoes they were wearing, what sizes, and while you're at it, see if any of them put that backpack under her head. Thanks. Yes, ma'am. What do you think, the perp got out of the car? Why? See if she was alive? Briggs, if you hit a kid, wouldn't you want to know? Okay, let's just cordon this off. Hey. Jo, you okay? So now you have my full attention. What's... What's up, honey? Is it the party? Huh? I have to tell you something. Darling, where do you keep the silver polish? The utensils are a little dull. It's under the sink, Mother. No, I just looked there. I couldn't find it. I'll be in in a minute. Don't tell me, your mother's making you crazy again? Well, honey, well, come on then. Tell me, what is it? It... It is the party, isn't it? Listen, listen, honey. Honey, I know I haven't been around to help much. I mean, ever since we got the Jerry Ross account, and I've been up for partner, I know... I'll be the first to admit it. I know I've been a little bit distracted. No, it's... Honey, listen, It's going to be fine. Your party is going to be great. They're always great, okay? I just want you to relax and have a good time tonight. Okay? Okay. Okay. Daddy, are you coming? I'm going to be right there, sweetie. One second. Okay? Mmm-hmm. I love you. I love you. Okay. Let's take a look at that homework. There you are! - Did you have one? - Yeah. It's great. Yes, I would like information about a patient, and it could be emergency or pediatrics. Good to see you. Jennifer, you want some turkey? Hey. Hi, Doug. You kids haven't, uh, seen Joanna, have you? Uh, no. Sure haven't. Sorry. Save some for dessert, there. The patient's name is Corey, Kelly Corey. Hi. Hey, Doug. In the kitchen. Don't let him tell you that joke again. Don't let him. There you are. Who you calling? Nancy. It's late, and I was surprised that she wasn't here yet. Honey, she just walked in. She just walked in. Really? Come on, you're missing our party. Did she bring the boys? Good. Yes. Hey, Jo, what's Kurt's wife's name again? Carol? Caroline. Caroline? They've got twins, right? Boys? Uh-huh, that's right. Right? Kurt, Caroline, how are you? How are the twins? - Mother. - Hey, Doug, how are ya? You think so? Hi. Joanna, these are delicious. Hey. You have to promise me that if you do go back to work you won't stop throwing parties. But if you do stop throwing parties, you will make up a few trays of these just for the book club. I promise. Okay. Oh, my gosh. Did you hear about that little girl in Mrs. Oaken's class? Oh, you mean the hit and run? Yes. Wasn't that awful? I mean, to just abandon her like that. I just keep thinking that it... I mean, it could've been my Jennifer. Well, it could have been any of our children. Is there any word on how she is? Is she any better? I don't know. Coma. That's all I've heard. My God. Great party. Not that I'm surprised. Oh, thanks. Hi. Hi, Nancy. Ooh, I love your earrings. Thank you, I picked them up yesterday at the mall on one of those carts. We were just talking about that little girl who got hit. You know, Kelly Corey. Don't you know their family? Yeah, Kelly goes to Sunday school with Jake. Bev, her mom, is just a doll. Last fall when I sprained my ankle and couldn't drive, she picked up Jake and dropped him off at home every Sunday for a month. This whole thing is so crazy. I bet the driver was drunk. You know, I have been thinking shouldn't the PTA be good for something besides car washes and bake sales? I mean, isn't there something we could do to help this child's family? That's a good idea. I'll set up an emergency PTA meeting first thing tomorrow morning, and I'll ask somebody from the police department to come. Oh. Then they can tell us exactly what we could do to help. Everyone, everybody, could I get your attention for a second? I just, uh, want to take a second and thank you all for coming. I think we're proof that even a little rain can't hurt a great party. And, uh, I would like to take a second to, uh, toast the person that makes this possible every year, because, uh, well, Lord knows, I don't do anything. To my wife, the most wonderful woman I know. - Aw. And who also happens to throw the best first-day-of-summer party in the entire western world. - To Joanna. - Here, here. Oh, oh, great. It's not a party till someone spills their drink. Thank you. Hey, did you reschedule the interview with that woman? At the teen center? Yeah. Yeah, it's tomorrow at 3:00. It will be good to get back on the fast track, huh? Meetings, deadlines, voice mail, email. Gee, they didn't even have email the last time you worked, did they? I guess you'll pick up fast. Yeah, that's what everybody tells me. Yeah. I don't know. God, isn't it terrible about that little girl that got hit? She's eight. Yeah. Holly's almost eight. Makes me just want to hug our kids and never let them go. What kind of a person do you think did that? I don't know. I think most people are decent. I think a decent person would have stopped. Decent person. Mmm-hmm. Do you think I'm a decent person? You? What kind of question is that? Well, I'm just thinking about this idea of a decent person, and I try to do the right thing, but sometimes I don't. Do you think I am a good person? I love you, Joanna. I know what kind of person you are. Honey? Mmm. Let's go. Hayden county sheriff's. You're aware that you can't do that, aren't you? Hey, Rico. Hey. Listen to this. I have to get... I have to get back. I have to get back! What do you think? A bad recording. Not a very distinct voice. Kind of sounds like my sister. Oh, yeah? Find out if she was tooling around town yesterday afternoon. You think the caller's our suspect? Could be. Nobody's taking credit for it yet. It would make sense if the driver was a woman. After all, nobody's claimed to have put that backpack under her head either, right? Sure reeks of maternal gesture to me. Maternal? Hey, speaking for the touchy-feely fathers of America, I am deeply offended. Sorry. We got the preliminary lab reports back. Nothing. No paint chips, no glass fragments. Doubt that car will be rolling into a body shop any time soon. No clean prints on the backpack, but, as far as the shoe prints are concerned out of 23, only three clean sets. Two of them we matched up. But the clean set you were so interested in? Well, behold. What we got here is this year's top-of-the-line ladies walking shoe size seven and a half. And the source of our mysterious footprint should look exactly like it. Well, I'll be darned, Replays. Very nice. Hey, careful with that. I got to take it back to the store. I don't know. Quiet road in a hoity-toity neighborhood seems likely our gal is a local. One of the Eaton elite? Maybe. Pretty ironic. What? Just that no amount of money can buy you a conscience. Dr. Lee to radiology. Dr. Lee to radiology. Mrs. Corey? My name is Joanna Kendall. My daughters go to Eaton elementary with her. Oh, of course. You look familiar. I must have seen you there... At... At the school. Yeah. How is she? Is she still... She hasn't woken up at all. I was wondering if there was anything that I could do. No. Thank you. Uh... I know where I know you from. You organize the Christmas toy drive. At the school? Yeah. Oh, that was good. All those toys for children who didn't have any. You know, we say we do those things because we care... And we do, but... But I... I think, deep in our hearts, we also do them because we hope that someday something good will come back to us. Maybe we just hope that if something bad is ever about to happen, God will look down and protect us. I'm sorry. I am so truly, truly sorry. What are you doing? What are you doing? Hi, ladies. Hey, sweetie. Hi. How are you? Oh, good. How are you? Oh, that's Tom Corey, Kelly's father. I can't imagine what they're going through. No. Mrs. Sanders? Yes, hi. Hi, I'm Detective Rico. This is Detective Briggs. Good to meet you. Ladies and gentlemen, could we all please sit down? All right. Hi, my name is Detective Rico. This is Detective Michael Briggs. Uh, Mrs. Sanders asked us to come and speak to you today. As you all know, a little girl named Kelly Corey was struck by a hit-and-run driver yesterday. Now, I'm here to tell you that we're going to do everything we can to help find the culprit. I know you want to help the police, but sometimes... It was a woman. How do you know? She left a footprint. Mr. Corey, how do you have this information? I have friends in the police department. They said she wore Replays. Replay walking shoes. Mr. Corey, do you mind if we speak in private for a moment, please? Why, Detective? They want to help. I mean, look, I know the police like to keep everything hush-hush, but I don't think you realize you're dealing with a concerned, caring community. It's true... My source wasn't sure, but he thinks it was either size seven or seven and a half. Geez, Replay walking shoes? Everyone has a pair of those shoes. I have a pair of those shoes. Seven and a half, I mean, that's such an average size. I have those shoes in size seven and a half. Me, too. Me, too. A pair of sneakers, is that all you've got? It's more than you think. People wear shoes down differently. Often one shoe is enough to catch a perpetrator. Do you think it was just somebody traveling through town? Maybe. Detective, you don't think it's someone from Eaton? No... I think it could be anyone. What is that supposed to mean? I mean, it's not somebody from around here, they would have said... Mrs. Kendall? Hi, Dana Keller. Hi. Glad you could finally make it. Thank you. Come on, we'll go through here. This is our rec room. What we're looking for is someone to cover all aspects of our public relations. Everything from fund-raising for our clinics, press releases for our substance-abuse treatment programs to establishing media contacts, to scheduling press conferences about our job placement services for runaways. In addition, I'd like to find someone who could organize special events. That's what attracted me to your resume. It says you've got a lot of experience in that area. Yes. Yeah. I, um... I throw a lot of parties. Oh. For my husband's business associates and for friends. Yes, well, um... Your resume also says that in your last position at, uh, Fox Frasier, you designed, developed and produced materials for a statewide public relations campaign? When I got out of college, I worked for a P.R. firm, and I would... I would put together, um... You know, organize things, yeah. I could call... I... Ugh. I'm sorry, I don't remember. It was a long time ago. It was before my husband... And the children, it's just... Do you know how that is, sometimes, you just... You don't remember? Max, get off. So, we may be getting a new client. You remember, uh, John Dealing? We met them at the Calkstein's last year? Anyway, he called me up this morning, and, uh, he owns this chain of furniture stores, and he's looking for a new firm. So I thought maybe, if all goes well, we could have them over for... For dinner. What do you think? Hmm? Maybe you could make your stroganoff and those apple torte things, huh? Those are so good. Huh? Sure. Hey, you didn't tell me. How'd the interview go? I bet you knocked them dead. No, I don't think so. You know, I... I don't think I'm really qualified for the job. Not qualified? You? Come on, honey. You were running the entire P.R. division at Fox Frasier when you were what, 25? I mean, come on, before we had the kids... Before we had kids was a really long time ago. I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't go back to work. I mean, the girls are really still little. They probably still need me, don't you think? Well, sure. Whatever you say. Hey, you want to work, fine. You don't want to work, it's also fine. Honey, just... You just do whatever you want, okay? All right, I'll just let you finish up. All right. I always preferred Lassie myself. Detective. Rico. Mrs... Kendall. Um, Joanna Kendall. Ooh, I got it. Nice to meet you. Thanks. Thinking of getting one of these for the Corey girl? Oh, uh, no, no. The flowers are for Kelly, but, um... I was thinking about the dog for my daughter. Oh. She's, um... She wants a puppy for her birthday and we already have a dog, and I don't really want another dog, so... When I saw this store, I thought I'd come in and look at the stuffed animals and see if there was one that looked like the kind of dog that she wants, but they don't have it here. What kind of dog does she want? White with black ears. Oh. That's what she said. Do you have children? No, not yet. Listen I... I know some of the moms are going canvassing today, and I just wanted to... Yeah, I wanted to get out this morning, too. Speaking of which, I really have to... I have to get back. Excuse me. Yeah, sure. Mrs. Kendall, you didn't happen to be in the area the day of the accident? As a matter of fact, I was. $6.50, please. I was, um, driving down Kensington just as the ambulance came. I'd been at Burt's produce. Near Hampton? Picking up fresh fruit. Mmm, I see. Did you see anything suspicious along the way? Um... Well, not that I can remember. No... No, nothing at all. Sorry I can't be more helpful. Mmm. You have a nice day. Your change, ma'am. Please send an ambulance. She's hurt. I... I have to get... I have to get back. I have... I have to get back. She's hurt. I... I have to get... I have to get back. I have... I have to get back. Hi, Nance, you look great. Hi, thanks. How are you? Well, I've been canvassing all morning. I am tired. You must be, too. I am. I went to 10 different houses. Came up with nothing. How about you? Everybody's heard of it, nobody saw it. You know, in all the commotion I forgot to tell you what a great time I had at your party. Thank you. I mean it, honestly. My boys, well... My three overly-big-for-their-age sons, mentioned how good everything was. Thank you. The flowers were beautiful. The food was delicious. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It was just a party, okay? Goodness sake. I'm sorry. Oh... I haven't been sleeping very well lately. No? I've been trying to figure something... Some things out. You know, I wanted to tell you, you looked great at the party the other night. Yeah? Yeah. Thanks. Well, I'm really mad at myself, though. Remember the earrings I had on? I lost one. Oh, no, Nancy, I'm sorry. I know they were new, right? Yeah, what can you do? Easy come... Here you are. Thanks. Club soda and lime with some water. Sure. Oh, by the way, you are going to the vigil, right? The vigil? Tom Corey wanted us to have a candlelight vigil at the hospital tomorrow night. He wants everybody in town to be there. Parents, kids, everyone. You know what, I thought of something else, too. Um, if Kelly's not better by this weekend, I think a bunch of us should stop by the hospital and pay a visit to Bev. Maybe take her to lunch or just try to get her out of that room for a few hours. That's a really good idea. You know, I... I keep thinking about that meeting at the school. It is so strange to me that the person who hit her had the exact same sneakers as me. I know. Oh, God, that's right. We both have them in a seven and a half, don't we? Maybe I've been watching too many Columbos, but... You don't think the police are going to want to talk to us, do you? Because we have the same shoes? I know, we went to lunch that day, and then I ran errands, but... I... I couldn't tell you exactly what I was doing every minute. Do you know where you were when she got hit? Joanna? I drove by right after it happened. You drove by the accident? Well, why didn't you tell me? It just never seemed to be the right time. Hello? Hi, Nancy. Oh. Hi. You okay? Uh, of course. Why? I don't know, you just... You just sound a little strange, that's all. Well, I have company coming over. All right, then, I won't keep you. Um, I'll see you tonight, then? I really should go... Uh... Nancy, I... I found your earring... ♪ Holy, holy, holy ♪ Lord God, almighty ♪ Early in the morning ♪ Our song shall rise to thee ♪ Holy, holy, holy ♪ Merciful and mighty ♪ God in three persons ♪ Blessed trinity We're praying for you, Tom. Our thoughts are with you. Hang in there, Tom. Thank you all for coming tonight. I have some wonderful news. Um, this morning I said Kelly's name, and she squeezed my hand. Uh, the doctors said it's definitely a sign of improvement, but, um... Now that we're all here, Tom and I needed to ask you for your help. If anyone knows anything about what happened, about the person who hit Kelly, I beg you, please, come forward now. That's all I have to say. Uh, except, thank you again for coming. We go live to Maureen Chang at Eaton Memorial Hospital. Maureen? Jim, I'm here with Kelly's father, Tom Corey, and Detective Meredith Rico. Thank you very much, both of you, for being here. Mr. Corey, we understand that Kelly's been in a coma since Thursday. Can you tell us more about her condition this morning? Um, she's better. Uh, the doctors say with kids you never know what's going to happen, but, um, this morning she moved her head a little. That's wonderful, Mr. Corey. Wonderful. Can you also tell us a little bit about the investigation? We understand that you're asking local residents to get involved. Uh, yes, uh, Detective Rico has told us that the print left by the driver's Replay shows a very distinctive mark, so, um, we're asking everyone, um, please, if you know something or suspect someone, call the police. Detective, anything to add to that? Well, yes, we've set up a confidential number, and anyone who has any information pertaining to the investigation, please feel free to use it. Shh. Hey, guys! Could you keep it down for a while, please? Sorry about that. So, detectives, I'm not exactly sure what I can do for you. Well, we've, uh, starting talking to all the PTA Moms, find out what they've learned canvassing, and, uh, find out what they were doing the day of the accident. Well, you don't think it's one of us. I mean, why? Like I said, it could be anyone. What was your day like last Thursday? Well, I... I was here at the house all morning, and then I had lunch at Val's. With Joanna Kendall? Yes, that's... That's right. How did Mrs. Kendall seem to you? How did she seem? I don't know. Fine. Busy. She threw a party that night. She had tons of things to do. Like? Like make fruit boats and set up tables. I thought you wanted to know what I was doing. I'm sorry, I don't know why you're asking me questions about Joanna. Is she a suspect? Should she be? No. - Of course not. - I... Detective, look, I've known Jo since... Since we were in grade school. She's very well respected in this town. I'm sure she is. And I can't imagine in a million years, she would ever... Mrs. Grayson, thank you. You really have been very helpful. Here's my card in case you remember anything. Okay. Um, you're not going to talk to all of her friends, are you? I mean, this is a small community and asking those kinds of questions could really hurt a person's reputation. Seems like reputation is pretty important around here. Yeah, it is. Well, it's nice to see you so concerned about Mrs. Kendall's. Some people might be more worried about their own. Look, I hear what you're saying, Mrs. Grayson. As a matter of fact, I think we should keep this little visit just between us. Thank you. Mommy! Mommy, I'm scared! Holly? Holly? Mrs. Kendall! Mrs. Kendall, hi. Detective. Uh, you know, I was just going to go grab some coffee, but now that I've run into you, I've got a theory on the case that I'd like to run by you. Can I walk you to your car? Well, I... I really have to get back home. It's Saturday, and... And my children... You know what, it'll only take a minute and I'll help you with these. Thank you. You're welcome. So what's your theory? Well, you know, everyone seems to think that our suspect is a real bitch of a woman. And you don't? Mmm-hmm. No, as a matter of fact, I don't. I think this person is a good, respectable member of our community who was probably on her way to drop off a video or pick up some dry cleaning, and that she accidentally hit this kid and just panicked. And then I think she said to herself, "My God, what are people going to say?" I mean, if she's an Eaton resident, what would be worse than being known as some hit-and-run driver of a child, for God's sake? This is a small town, people talk. They'd whisper about her, her husband. Even her kids would get the shaft. Her life would be history. Just because in one split little second in a state of confusion she made one really bad decision. She ran. Do you mind if we sit in your car for a second? No. Here, I'll get that for you. I'll go around back. So let me ask you this. If it were you who hit this kid, by accident, would you have fessed up? 'Cause I'd like to think that I would, but unless you're in that situation, you never really know, do you? Detective, are you... Do you think I did it? No. No, of course not. I... I just wanted to know what you would think of my theory. Well... I'm not really very good at that kind of thinking. But, yeah, maybe. It could happen that way. So, you tell me. Are you any closer to catching the person that did it? Oh, we'll nail her soon enough. Uh-huh. Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if we find something else by the accident site. We're still combing the area. People are always leaving little clues without even knowing it. Or we might get a phone call with a tip, maybe a friend who notices something's a little off. Ah, I almost forgot. There's also this. Where on Kensington, ma'am? Please, send an ambulance. She's hurt. I... I have to get... I have to get back. I have... I have to get back. That voice doesn't sound familiar to you, does it? Well, anyway, something's about to give. One way or another. Which is why I think that it would be in her best interest to come forward now. I bet it would be a big relief to her. I'm sure she never thought she'd be in this situation. After all, we believe no evil... Till the evil's done. Yeah. Thanks for your time, Mrs. Kendall. Hmm. Hey... Drive carefully. Hey, sweetie. I'm glad you're home. Hey. Yeah, I think I'm going to take the jeep in have them change the oil, maybe check the brakes. Check the brakes? Yeah, when I was driving it last week, it seemed like they needed to be tightened up a little bit. Oh. Well, I think they're fine. Anyway, honey, get this one. I'm out here this morning cleaning out the garage, trying to get rid of all that old stuff. Yeah? You're never going to believe what Holly did. What? She decided she wanted to get all her old toys together and give them to charity. So she goes in here and gets all her stuff together, and... And what? We took it and dropped it off. Where? At the all-parish thrift shop. Joanna? Joanna, where are you going? Joanna? Excuse me, that's mine. I'm sorry? No, no, it's mine. It's mine. My... My daughter brought it in by mistake. Elizabeth can have three cookies if she's very, very good. And so can you, Lauren. Holly. Hi, Mommy. One more day before my birthday. Oh, I know, sweetie. I hear you did something wonderful today. Uh-huh. I gave away my old toys. Listen, I have to ask you a question. Was there anything in the shapes box? Yes, your sneakers. I put them in your closet. Okay. Thank you. Why did you put them in the shapes box? Well, I was cleaning the garage, and I, um, didn't want to get them dirty. So, I put them in the box. You cleaned the garage with no shoes on? Not exactly. That wasn't what... Come here, I want to tell you something. I'm very proud of what you did today. Holly. Yeah? I love you. I love you very, very, very much, and I always will. So you remember that, okay? Okay. Mommy, do you love me more 'cause I gave away my toys? I love you when you do good things. And I love you when you do something wrong. There's nothing that you could do to make me love you more or less. Nothing. Sweet child. Okay, get back to Lauren, okay? Okay. I'll be right back. Joanna. What? What... What are you doing? There... There were some things I wanted back. They had sentimental value... Wait. Wait a minute. Those old toys had sentimental value to you? Give me a break, Joanna. What the hell is going on? Nothing! I don't know. I'm just not thinking straight. Just keep screwing things up. What... What things? The interview... At... At the teen center. I just blew it. Well, is... Is that such a terrible thing? I mean, one interview? I mean, you said you don't even think you want to go back to work anyway. No, I said that I wasn't sure. What exactly are we talking about, Joanna? What, are you asking me to figure it out for you? No! I don't know. I am trying to tell you that I am just confused about some things. Are you sure that that's all it is? What's that supposed to mean? Just what I said. Are you sure that's all that's going on here? Yeah, I'm sure. Very healthy breakfast. At least I can eat like I'm pregnant. Yeah, that's real nice. Care to join me? Is that the hit and run? How's it going? What happened to this little girl just seemed so senseless, you know? We're trying so hard to bring a child into this world, and I keep thinking that... After all this trying and hope and love, that somebody could just take your child away, just like that. Maybe you want off this case, baby. No. No, I know who did it. Joanna Kendall. PTA Mom extraordinaire. You know the people in this town really like her? Almost as much as they hate the person that hit Kelly Corey. If only they knew she was one and the same. Proof? Not enough. Why not just call her on it? I tried as much as I could. She would not cop to it. You know, it's crazy. I mean, I... In one way, I feel sorry for her. I see her getting deeper and deeper into this thing, and I want so badly to help her, but... After all, it was an accident, you know? Then I think about this little girl, and I just get so mad. Just for a split second, I actually enjoy watching her squirm. Is that terrible, John? I don't know. Is it? Where have you been? For a drive. For a drive? It's 4:00 in the morning, Jo. Look at you. You're all wet. I... I had car trouble. You had car trouble? Uh-huh. Yeah, well, I looked through your closet. I found something. I found these. Uh, I'm sorry. You know, I just had one little smoke every once in a while, and... And I was just too embarrassed to... It's not about the cigarettes! Don't you understand? I am sitting here, wracking my brain trying to figure out what is going on with you! Doug, I have... Jo, no. I have to know. Are you having an affair? What? Are you? No! What makes you think that I could be having an affair? Why are you walking away from me? I think it's a pretty logical assumption given what's been going on, Jo. Logical? It's logic... How many years have we been living together? And it's logical to you that I would be having an affair. Don't you know me at all? I know you enough to know that this is about more than one little interview. I know that. One little interview. Yes. One... That's so easy for you to say. It's just so easy, isn't it? Everything is easy for you. You have no idea what it was like going into that office and... And seeing everybody on their faxes and their phones, and everybody's so sure of what they're doing. And... And, I know that I used to be able to do that, but now I'm not sure that I can hack it or if I even want to hack it anymore. You have no idea! God! Why didn't you tell me this before? I did. I tried to. But you weren't listening. Jo... Jo, I told you this before. You don't have to go back to work. You know, it's not like we need the money. You're not even listening to me now. Jo... Look, I don't know what you want me to say. I tell you to go back to work, and it's like I'm not a good provider. I tell you not to go back to work, it's like I'm not supporting your needs. I tell you to do whatever you want, and I'm not helping you make a decision. I don't know! I want something! What? I don't know! I want things to be back to normal. I want you to be back to normal. Is that too much to ask? drive each other crazy. Hey, Nancy. Hi. Bev. Any change? No, not yet. Hi, Nancy. Hi. I... I found this when I was cleaning. It's your earring. I thought you'd want it back. Oh, thank you. Yeah. Joanna. Hey, I'm surprised you made it. I thought you'd be getting ready for Holly's party. Well... There's not that much left to do. I ordered the cake and, um, put most of the decorations up last night. Bev, why don't you come out with us? Just for a little while. Get some fresh air, maybe some food? Yeah. Come on. I appreciate all of you being here today, but I... I can't leave. I just... I can't. - It's okay. - Bev? Bev! Kelly! Oh, my God, what happened? Kelly? Kelly. Oh, baby. She woke up. Just like that, she woke up. How do you feel, honey? I'm thirsty. There's water on the... I'll get it. Thank you. We're going to get you something to drink, honey, okay? Okay? Thank you. There you go. Good girl. Mommy, what happened? Why am I here? Don't you remember anything? Don't you remember what happened? I know you. You're that lady in the car. When I was going to school, you told me I dropped my pencil case. Kelly, honey, do you remember anything else? Do you remember riding your bike in the rain? - That's all right, sweetie. - That's okay. Suspect left her home on Cedar Road at 0354 hours, drove to the accident site at Kensington and Hampton, and then drove home at 0448 hours. Thanks, Mike. Let me have that, please. Well, she went out there. That says something. I say we have enough reasonable suspicion to bring her in for questioning. Let's put her in the box. I give her 20 minutes, tops, before she breaks. No, let's wait a while. I want to follow up on some other leads. Other leads? There aren't any other leads. She's going to turn herself in. I can feel it. She hasn't copped to it by now, why would she? 'Cause I don't think she can take it anymore. If it were me, I'd be losing my mind by now. I'd have to come clean. So what? You're saying it's better if she comes in by herself? Not for us, maybe for her. All right, throw it to me. Come on, Daddy, catch. Not so hard. Not so fast. Hey. Hi, Mommy. Hi. We didn't know when you were coming back, and I couldn't wait any longer, so Daddy said I could open some of my presents. Why don't you go ahead, honey? Open your big present. Mommy, how's Kelly? She's going to be fine. She woke up. Really? Oh, that's great! I'll be right back. Go and get some rest now, okay? Oh, yeah. I will. Bev, I am so happy for you. Thank you. Thanks for being here. My pleasure. I'll see you. Bye, guys. Bye. See you. Oh... You all should go, too. Are you sure? I'm sure. I'm fine now. Tom's in there with her and... I'm going to go get a cup of coffee. Good. I'll call you tonight and tell you how she's doing. Great. Hey. Bev, I need to talk to you. It's an electric keyboard, and it plays songs, and you can sing along with it. But I wanted a puppy. I thought if I gave away all my toys, you'd get me a puppy. Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry, but we don't need another dog right now. Girls... Could you gather up some of your new toys and go outside and play for a little while? But I still have more presents to open. I know. You can open them later. I really need to talk to your father right now. Thank you. Um... These are the ones that I was wearing... On the day that I hit Kelly Corey. What? I don't know how it happened, but it did. And then I... I went to get help. And when I came back, all these people were there talking about what terrible person hit this child and then drove away. And I wanted to say, "I didn't hit her and drive away. "I mean, I came back. I came back. I'm here!" But I didn't. I think part of me couldn't believe that I actually did it. And the other part of me... Well, I just had one thought. I thought about Mindy. And I thought none of the little girls would play with her anymore because she would be the child whose mother hit that... Little girl. But after... Why didn't you tell me after? I tried to! I wanted to. I tried to tell you that day. I tried to tell you that night, but you were already talking about what kind of a person would do this. How could I tell you I was that person? I have been so confused lately, I... About what I'm supposed to do with this part of my life, and... Who I am, and then the accident happened. You know when... When people say that the decisions that you make in an instant are the ones that define your true character? Well, I have been thinking, is this my true character? Is this who I really am? Am I a coward? I think I'm going to wonder about that for the rest of my life. You were right... When you said that I don't know you. I'm sorry. Aw, honey, I'm so sorry I lied to you. When we first got married, you liked that I was very strong and sure of myself. But lately I haven't been feeling so strong. And I just can't do this. I cannot... I was afraid to tell you. I cannot pretend anymore! I can't do it for you, and I can't do it for me. I can't do it anymore. I love you. I love you. I still love you, and I'm not confused about that. I don't know if I could ever look at you again and not wonder what other secrets you were hiding. Well, it's not the lies that are going to end us. It's the truth. Are you sure? Every time I looked at you I thought "If I were Bev, I'd want to know." But I kept hoping I was wrong. Then this morning when Kelly woke up, it hit me, and I knew in my heart. I knew. The questions from the police, the reaction that day, I... This is crazy. Not Joanna. Why would she come to the vigil? Why would she come to the hospital? Why would she come and visit Bev and pretend? Bev, where are you going? Wait, we'll call the police. No, this is between her and me. Mindy, look, he came to see me for my birthday. Hi, Mrs. Corey. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't see her. I swear to God, it was an accident, and I went back. Stop it! Stop it. What kind of person are you? You have children. What kind of mother are you? How could you have done this? I wish I could take it back. It was an accident, I'm sorry. I... I wish... Never! There's nothing you can do to take this back. My mommy says that Kelly's getting better. When is she coming back to school? Come on, Holly. Mindy, come here. You'll never understand what a hell this has been. I almost lost my child. No one should ever have to face that. Not even you. Mommy, what was Mrs. Corey talking about? Come on, girls, let's take Mrs. Palmer's dog back. Sit down, Mrs. Kendall. I've been waiting for you. That goes back right now! Look, we can't afford those! Hi. Um, if you're busy, I can come back. Oh, no. Come on in. I don't have to be at work until 5:00. Working part-time at a bookstore. It's not what I thought I'd end up doing, but, you know, it's a start. You want one? No, thank you. You sure? Yeah. I make them for the neighbors. We're friends for life. No, really, thanks. You know, I wanted to speak to you at your hearing, but, uh, it just never seemed to be the right time. You want to sit down? Yeah, thanks. Maybe I just didn't know what the right thing to say would be, but... Um, but as far as those things go, I thought it went okay, you know. What was it? Six months probation for leaving the scene? Mmm-hmm, and my driver's license suspended for a year. I'll get it back in a few months. I'm not sure that I care. I thought I was going to go to jail. I was pretty lucky. I should say congratulations, Detective. Thank you. It's a boy. I miss mine. Is your husband making it hard to see them? Oh, no. No, it's nothing like that. It's me. I think about going to talk to them, and even after all this time, I don't know what to say. The last thing that I wanted to do was hurt them, and that is exactly what I did. You know, Detective, I was a good mother. Sometimes if I think I just hold onto that I can live with myself. I can live with all of this. I don't care what anybody says. I taught my daughters about right and wrong and about love. Did you teach them about forgiveness, Mrs. Kendall? Ah, here they come. Sweetheart, hi! Let's hurry and go pick up Daddy. Timothy. She should stay away. She's got a lot of nerve. Hi. Hi. Mommy! Oh, sweetie. Look at my girls. I missed you so much. Ah, gorgeous. Let's get out of here. Okay, come on. Come on, sweetie, we have to go. Bring that with you!
