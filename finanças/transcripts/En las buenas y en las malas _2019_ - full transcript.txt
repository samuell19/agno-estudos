[man] All of us have wondered... what is love? [music starts] [man] Love is... commitment. Sharing your life. All of it. Your fears and dreams. But... the more you share the more you love? Or the longer the relationship the more you love? How do you rate a good relationship? By moments? Which ones? The happy ones? Or perhaps by enduring the sad ones? [music continues] I HOPE YOU NEVER STOP LOVING ME Hi. [music continues] Hello. Where did you get wine? Over there. Would you have a glass with me... or seven? OK... I'm Sebastián. Valeria. [Sebastián] Why is it different to fall in love than to love somebody? [music continues] To fall in love is simple. It's about emotions... first times... The first date. The first touch. And the first kiss. [cell phone rings] [Sebastián] What if we put it all together? The real and the virtual? THREE YEARS AGO YOU STARTED DATING SEBASTIAÁN [Sebastián] If we put together the laughter... the kisses... All the pictures we took. The ones we shared and those that are private. And what about the late-night conversations? The messages, the comments, the posts... If we put together all we shared... The movies, the songs... I LOVE YOU, PANDA More moments... equals a better relationship? The more information we create... the more we love each other? Perhaps. But in the real or the virtual world... An action, a word... one click... can delete everything. [music continues] I got it when I met Valeria. I had to go back to my mom's after going all in and losing everything. And yes, there were hard times, but we faced them together. And we would move forward just the same. [cell phone rings] NEW MESSAGE IT'LL BE OK, PANDA. WE'LL GO THROUGH IT TOGETHER NOW AND ALWAYS... I LOVE YOU NEW MESSAGE THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I'D BE LOST WITHOUT YOU. I LOVE YOU, PANDA. I love you, Panda. [music continues] [music ends] VALERIA INCOMING CALL [woman] The call will be charged... [honking] Sebastián! [honking] Damn it! Damn it! [Valeria] Sebastián! I'm coming! I'm ready, honey! -Just a minute! -Hurry up! [honking] -What is it? -Just hurry up! [music] [cell phone rings] -Hello? -Will you keep ignoring me? Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Wrong number. -Thanks. -Panda! You knew I had to work. I was up all night! Will you forgive me or we're going in like this? You promised we'd be on time. We didn't even make it to the service. I'm a maid of honor. Well, that may be not so bad. Standing up and sitting back down 50 times is absurd. I mean... Really? Hello. Your name, please? Valeria Laisequilla... plus one. God! Will you forgive me already? We missed the service, so what? What do you mean? You know Ale is one of my best friends and I missed her walking down the aisle. Yeah, Ale, Dani, Majo and Sofi all are your best friends and all want to get married. What's with that? But that's not the point. The point is: you should forgive me so we can enjoy the wedding. It's not my fault that you don't have friends. You'll pay for this. Wasn't the release in a month? Yes, but we had to work on... Valeria Laisequilla plus one. -Table seven. -Thank you. Plus one. [exhales] It's not convenient to invest in cryptocurrency, it's obsolete. Now multi-sided platform companies are in. So, what are you doing now, Sebas? [Sebastián] I am... going after my dreams now. I finally became... the caretaker of a whole building. Is that part time while you go after your dreams or...? Full time. In fact, I started as a janitor and now... I'm in charge. He's obviously joking, Erick. He works at a record label. He's in charge of the digital transition. Oh, I see! Another of your projects like... that of the online music app... TuRocolApp, with double "p." It was very similar to Spotify, right? The wedding is awesome, right? Ale and I would always dream of a wedding like this. -Besides, Roy is a great guy. -[woman] I know, right? Ale must be really nervous. Why nervous? I mean, if they always dreamed of this wedding and Troy is a great guy... -Roy. -Roy is a great guy. Yes, but this will be her first time. The first time she gets married? No, honey. Ale is a virgin. [Sebastián laughs] [Sebastián] In a school play? No, I mean it. God... I get it. Nothing at all? She saved herself for this special time. She "saved herself." So, not even... Hey, Sebas is a bit out of line, isn't he? Your husband is charming! -We're not married. -We're just dating. [Sebastián] So, hold on... Back on that... What if they don't like it? Right? It's like... buying a very expensive car without test-driving it. -That's for idiots. -I was a virgin, too... and I'm no idiot. No, that's not it, girl. Sebastián didn't mean that. -Right? -No, not at all. You are... totally different. -You are doing really well. -Yes. I need to go to the toilet. [man coughs] Are you OK, man? -Do you need water? -No, I'm fine. -Who are you? -I'm... Valeria's plus one. Huh? Valeria, the bride's friend. Twenty-seven. Since Ale has so many friends, I resolved to number them. Nice. And who are you? I am the groom. Whose? At the wedding. Damn, you're right! Congratulations. -Do you want some? -No, I'm fine. -Just a hit. -No, really... -Come on, just a hit. -OK. [exhales] I don't know what I'm doing. I know, dude. You're getting married. When I saw her walking down the aisle, I wanted to run away. Why did you get married then? Ale is two months pregnant. What! Isn't she a...? Rodrigo! What are you doing here? I've been looking for you. I can't stand these heels! -Nothing. -Hi, how are you? -Congratulations! -Thanks! Come with me, the Garcías are here. What did I tell you? -We must always be together. -Yes. How are you enjoying the party, handsome? I'm good. Guys, I mean, this is my moment! Attending weddings is weird. It's like... going to the past. Not everybody is afraid of commitment. I know, but it's unnecessary. What? Are you never getting married? Like this? A wedding party, a service, 200 guests and a drunk bride, no. Not even with the love of your life? Look at that, honey. It's embarrassing. You fell for it, you really did... It's unnecessary, old-fashioned. I'm feeling sick, shall we go? [Ale] One... two... three! Honey... wake up, sleeping beauty. -We're here. -Where are you going? Well, I'm going up... to your place. No? I thought we could... Why would I go to my place with a guy who doesn't want to commit? I'm not fifteen. No. Get an Uber, Sebastián. -Bye. -Panda, wait. Panda, hold on! Hold on! You know I wasn't talking about us. I mean... Ale and her fancy wedding, well... I felt overwhelmed, but... I love you. You're my soulmate. [music] -Hold on! Hold on! -What? What about your roomie? He went on vacation with his boyfriend. -OK. -Uhu. How drunk are you? -I won't forgive you so easily. -OK. What's with your dress? -Hold on. -What? Now what? I love you, idiot. And I love you. -Sebastián! -I can't unzip your dress! Let me see. How many fucking layers are there? -Tear it off! Ow! -Are you OK? [music] [alarm] Working on Sunday is a drag. -Hey! -[groan] What's going on? I don't want to go to work. I'm mad at you. But I can't quite remember why. -You're not mad. -I am. Everything is OK. I love you, little Panda. [music] [little boy screams] -So they can continue. -Precisely. Thank you. I'll see you in a minute. Cheers. NEW MESSAGE PANDA, I DON'T FEEL VERY WELL. I'M SORRY, I CAN'T SEE YOU LATER, BUT YOU'LL DO AMAZING. I LOVE YOU. -Sebas! -Alonso. How are you? I'm fine, bro. Hey, don't... -Alonso... -Your skin is so soft. -Come on... -You remind me of Valeria. Don't start man, I mean it. -By the way, where is she? -She couldn't make it. That is a real woman. I mean it. Don't start, man. Do you know what I miss the most about her? -No and I don't care. -To make love to her. Son of a bitch! You know? I've been with over a thousand women and I've never felt the connection I had... Sebastián? -Hi, Mike. -Mike. I was talking with Alonso. There's something wrong with the platform. Give me your mobile. What do you need it for? Take it. What is it? Let's see. -Show me. -That's it. Is that all? Huh? The problem was your phone. When you downloaded the app, did you allow data sharing? No way, that makes me very nervous. What if someone accesses my phone and hacks it! Nobody wants to, Mike. That is necessary so the app can use your mobile Internet connection. So, in that case, I owe you an apology, don't I? I'm sorry, OK? Can you imagine what could have happened if you hadn't invested all your money in your application and Spotify hadn't gotten ahead of you? TuRocolApp, with double "p." Exactly, huh? You would be one of those young billionaires now. [laughs] Come on, truth is, at first I doubted hiring you. Mostly, because of your massive failure. But now I see... it was the best decision. By the way, do you remember you said something about hiring a "training"? A trainee. That's it, a "trainer." Hey, Pam! She is my daughter. And I want her to be useful. Sure, she must be the youngest and she might call you... daddy, right? Yes, why? Hey, daddy. Pamela, this is Sebastián. The guy I told you about. Hi, I'm Sebastián. How are you? I'm Pamela. Pamela is taking a gap year and I want her to learn a bit of the business. I'll be all yours these months. Excuse me? -No, I didn't mean... -I get it. I get it. I'll leave you to two to break the ice. Bye, princess. See you, my visionary man. Number one! Take care of her. -I will, Mike. -OK. -Stop it. -I love you, I can't help it! I don't know why he thinks that looks good. Well, your father belongs to a generation of rockers that... is dying. It's OK. -The music is great. -Yes, in fact... -we brought the band to... -Oh, I love this song. -Do you want to dance? -In a minute, yes. [music] NEW MESSAGE Who is texting you this late? Huh? Sorry, no. Weren't you on pills? Yes, but I forgot to take it on the wedding day and the next day, I was hungover and I did, too. And the day after, I took three. But... it was useless. Useless. What if it's a phantom pregnancy? They are real. They are. It's a fact. We'll sort it out. Don't worry. Everything will be OK. You... want to have it, right? Yes. [sighs] Well, it's not like I planned it, I'm scared to death... but I think it's different to get pregnant at 15 than at 28. Look, I also know... this isn't the best timing for us... but I do want to have it. What about your career? Which one? Being a restaurant hostess? Being a photographer! It's not a terminal illness, it's a baby! [music] [clears throat] We're having a kid. Like mature adults. Are we? Sometimes. Two green juices. No prickly pear for me. -Sure, and for you? -The same, but without sugar. -All right. -Hi, Mom. -How far along is she? -How do you know? [laughs] Don't be silly, I'm your mother. How far along? One month and a few days. Oh! Oh, how exciting! I'm finally going to be a grandmother. I don't know what to do. I'm really scared. Well, you'll do what is right. I didn't raise a jerk. Hi, how are you? Hi, Juan. The usual, please. Right away, ma'am. I... I'm happy! Smile! [baby crying] [sighs] Honestly, I'm scared to death. But I do want to have it. Well, it's not a big deal. It's like having a Tamagotchi. I mean, you say your boyfriend is doing well, right? Yeah. Valeria, the truth is, we're nearly adultescents. Besides, remember they say a child is born under a lucky star. -Yes, you're right in that. -Yes. Look, just relax and let it flow. Everything will be alright. Thanks. Panda! -It's really late! -It is! -Give me a minute! -Hurry up! -I'll be right back! -I'll wait here. Hi, the bar is about to close. Can I offer you a drink? No, thanks. I'm just waiting for Valeria. -Sebastián. -Yes. Damn it, man! Do you remember me? Long time no see, man! Alberto! From high school! The Sevilla, man! -Alberto... -Can I sit down? You already did. Damn! You still have that black humor. So, what have you been up to? Are you still in that posh rock band? I'm not posh and I quit the band. Denial. Honestly, the songs were too corny for me. But you always defended your style, that was cool. Yes, actually, we did. And what about you? Do you still jump anything that moves? Hey, not so loud, people will think I'm a stalker and I'll get hash-tagged and everything. Look, I know... I know I was a mess in high school, but I've changed. I'm really glad for you, Alberto. It was nice to see you. Since I met Jesús and I let him into my life... the truth is, it changed. I became a more enlightened being. OK... You want to meet Jesús, don't you? No, I'm fine. He always wants to meet people. Certainly. -I really don't... -Jesús! I'm more of an atheist... [Sebastián laughs] Jesús, this is Sebastián, my high school best friend. Sebastián, this is Jesús. -No way, is this Jesús? -Yes. -Sebas! -What's up, Chuy? -Hi. -We were never best friends. -He's just joking. -You know my Betito. Are you... a couple? -Yes, since... -Last month? The inventory night when you got here. -Of course. -Stop it, Beto! I'm glad you assumed it. Assumed what? That you're gay. -Who is? -You. I'm not gay, man. -What? -[Jesús] I'll explain it, OK? I'm gay. He isn't. And it's OK, I don't need a label. No, hold on. You don't have to explain yourself. -Beto, honey... -It's very clear. Yes, we have, because there are many close-minded people like him and we have to explain them. -That's impossible, man. -I mean... So, you're saying that because I'm gay, I can't have a heterosexual boyfriend? I mean, apples to apples and oranges to oranges. None should mix, right? You know what? I didn't know you were like this. You're... a super Nazi. You're a couple, right? -Yes. -Yes, that's what we said. And you fuck. Hold on, I won't answer that. It's a very tacky question. Of course we fuck, man! OK? I'm a man, I need to fuck. Exactly, you're a man, but it turns out you're gay. I'm not gay, man! I don't like they put inside... Beto, hold on! You may not like anything inside you, but... you like touching another man. Beto, it's OK. I'll explain to him. I'll ask you something, OK? Do you jack off? Yes, what does that have to do with...? [Jesús] You're gay. Period. You like to touch another man. -He's gay, don't get mad. -Yes, he is. -But it's me... -It's the same, you are. -Honey... -I'm glad you two met. He's Jesús' boyfriend. I've told you about him. Van, they went to high school together. Can you believe it? It's like destiny. -Really? How crazy! -Yes. Destiny. -See you. -Bye, Chuy. -Bye, Sebas. -Bye, Alberto. -Nice to see you. -Bye! -Take care. -Bye! I'm really glad Jesús is finally with someone well-balanced who takes care of him and loves him. Yes, very well-balanced. -We're really late, hurry up. -Let's go. "I promised him," she told me. But she doesn't want to have children. Or to choose any sperm or that nobody gets inside her for 9 months. Can you hear me, darling? I don't want love to be marriage, children and Instagram pictures. I just want it to be... the unpredictable silence in the sofa. Forever. [applause] Thank you. [Valeria] You snored all the play, Sebastián! "Play"? That is a joke to theatre! -I loved it. -Yeah, right, because she's your super conceptual and artsy friend. I won't move in three hours. Hey! I invited her to your birthday party. -Behave! -Alright, but she'll have to blink. It freaks me out she doesn't. [guitar music] What is it? Do I have a booger? No, you don't. So? Vale... -Why are you acting so weird? -No, I'm not. I was thinking... on this subject... I mean, in this situation that... I think the best for both would be... I mean, what we should... Well, yes... Well... We should get married. -What? -We should get married. Are you proposing to me? Yes. Sort of. -"Sort of"? How romantic! -No, no. I am. I'm asking you to marry me. Valeria Laisequilla, would you... be my wife? I swear I'll get you a real one when I have money. You know I don't care about that. Is that a yes? Are you asking me... because of the baby or... because you love me? -Because of our kid, obviously. -Sebastián! Because I love you. What do you say? Hmm... Then... -Yes. -[Sebastián] Yes? [guitar music continues] I love you. What? Are you happy? You are? I love you. I love you, too. [guitar music ends] I think we can make the graphic straight and the letters closer. That's it. I sent you a Facebook friend request. You did? -Let's see. -Yes. You accepted it. Well, I sometimes don't pay attention... to Facebook. -All these numbers... -Do you have like... many fans? Fans? Just my mom. That's cute. There's something that doesn't... What? Has anyone told you you look like Christian Grey? Who? The sexy millionaire from Fifty shades. -Me? -Yes. -No, I don't think so. -I mean it. Look, come here. Okay, your hair is a bit short, but if you do it this way... That's it, you look like him. [message ping] You're... you're getting emails. You've got... emails. I'll talk to my friend, Father Paulino, to get you married as soon as possible. We don't want a church wedding. Sebastián is... Well, he doesn't believe in those things. Then... What are you going to do? We're having a civil wedding, for the time being. You're not getting married, then. -It's the same for us, Dad. -For you... but in God's eyes, that child will be floating in Purgatory forever... No, he won't be floating anywhere! I came to give you the news, but I don't expect you there. Save yourself the embarrassment. Let's go. [clears his throat] Mr. Andrés. ABOUT PAMELA DOB: 08/25/98 RELATIONSHIP STATUS: SINGLE FAVORITE MUSIC: ANYTHING I CAN DANCE TO Ninety-eight? What was I...? Damn, she's younger than Super Nintendo. That's embarrassing, Sebastián. -Sebastián. -Mike! How are you doing with the app changes? It's going well, I was just working on them. That's great. And how has Pamelita been doing? Well, very well. She had a very hard time after the divorce. Yes, well... She was unstable. You know how that is, right? But if you notice she's sad, please, let me know. I see she's very well, Mike. Do you have the changes there? No, well, yes. But they aren't ready yet. I'll get them to your office as soon as finish. -No, let's see them now. -Let me finish, Mike. I want to do... Let me... Nothing worth doing can be done overnight. Let's see. Mike, I can explain. -For fuck's sake! -Mike... -No... -Mike... I'm more fucked up by the minute. -No, don't say that. -I can't see a thing without my glasses! Where are they? I'll come back in a minute, they're at my desk. You're an asshole, you're an asshole. [bell rings] Coming! Hi. How can I help you? You're Valeria, right? I'm Carolina. It's your pleasure to meet me, because I'm here to help you plan your dream wedding! [high pitch scream] I know, I hope you don't mind I've lots of ideas, but I know we must hurry up if you don't want your... how embarrassing, belly to show. I'm sorry, who are you? What are you doing here? You know what I think? We would get over with it faster if you weren't making this type of stupid questions. Why don't you tell me your... ideas? You may not have many or they may be bad, so I can tell you mine, which are amazing. Then, together, that is me and not so much you, we'll find a style, OK? A style that is... exactly what you don't have. -What is that? -Who is this? Is that thing the groom? No, that's Jesús, my roomie. You took a load off me. For a sec, I thought, this poor girl doesn't have style or good taste and she's pregnant. Excuse me? No, I mean, I'm perfect for this desperate and sad cases. -Like yours, so... -[Jesús] Fucking crazy. You must know what are these. -They're catalogues. -Carolina, right? Yes. What are you doing here? OK. I'm Carolina, right? I'm a wedding planner. That is, I plan weddings, in case you didn't know. I'm here to plan your dream wedding. -Would you like that? -Yes, I get that. Who hired you? [Jesús laughs] Your dad didn't tell you, did he? [Valeria] How dare you hire her, Dad? It's my wedding! It's not the money, don't you get it? I won't have a church wedding! And I won't go to hell, because it doesn't exist! Moreover, you hired a bipolar Art Attack girl. I don't care! Stay out of my life! -I was leaving, don't worry. -I'm so sorry. My dad drives me crazy. It's OK. I know very well how it works. Don't worry. I do. It's just that... since I broke up with my boyfriend... I try to move forward one way or another... and nothing works. But it's OK. Congratulations, I hope your wedding is amazing. Real pretty, real cute and real nice... and that your relationship works better than mine. Carolina, hold on. [music] I felt sorry for her. She's really depressed, she just broke up with her boyfriend. She's not bad, she's... kind of bipolar. Great, now we have a depressive and psycho planner. We wanted a small wedding, didn't we? You want a small wedding. I always wanted something bigger, but I made up my mind for us. Let it go. Bigger. The shrimp one is delicious. Yes, shrimp is really good. Full of cholesterol, bad for babies... OK, fine. [moans of enjoyment] This is my favorite. -No, I don't think so. -Why not? I'm just saying, it's full of salt and it causes swelling. You're very swollen, maybe you want a blowfish look. Enough. Write this down. And the Serrano ham one, too. If I get swollen, it's my problem. And if you don't fit in the dress, too. I'll write that down. What... What I don't get is... how can you submit a newborn to that savageness. That is called circumcision. And what is cut is the prepuce. Nobody likes a man with the skin hanging... -Who wants dessert? -I'll go with you. -Sir? -No. -Thank you. -And you, Mom? Yes. [Sebastián] A big success, right? Their eyes will get their eyes out. [Valeria] I don't know where to start. All of them look delicious. Let's see... chocolate. It's Nutella's, it's really good. Don't you dare. I swear I wasn't going to say anything. Hey, do you know what we have skipped? Your bachelorette party! I need you to make a list with all your guests, but more importantly, that you start to choose the toys. -No, Carolina. -Why not? Not here, there's people around. Besides, I've never liked those parties. Honestly, I think I'll pass. No, no, no. What are you talking about? Moreover, my friends are prudes. I don't think... Val, this is your last day of fun. It's madness, it's the day you surrender, let all your desires out and give up to marriage. Maybe. Maybe they'll have a lot of fun. Obviously! Just leave it all to me. I'll arrange it, and remember one thing Valeria. My wedding service is integral. Hey. Who is Pamela Asencio and why does she like all your posts? She's Mike's daughter. She's working at the office. I see. Do you like her? No way! No! Besides, she's almost a minor. She's a little girl. -Well, she likes you. -I don't think so. -It's your imagination. -Sebastián. Why would she like everything you post, then? I don't know, that's the way kids connect nowadays. What can I say? I don't get it either. Things are like that. By the way, Carolina is planning a bachelorette party with all my friends. Have you thought about yours? No, those are old-fashioned... boring, unnecessary, expensive... Stop it. It's up to you. Hey... Mike's birthday is on Friday. Shall we go? -Sorry. -Will I go alone again? -Come on. -No, I can't. My bachelorette party is on Friday and you can't be there. There will be only girls and Jesús. Obviously. You can't get... -Mike! -You made it, Sebas! It's nice to see you! -I wouldn't miss your birthday. -Thanks, son. Don't. This is Sebastián, darling. Hi, nice to meet you. Hi. Have a drink with me, would you? Sure. Cheers. Cheers. -Put that cigar down, darling. -Oh, come on! He will be OK. -Who? -The baby. I'm two months. -Pregnant? -Yes. Well, we have to greet The Trujillos that just arrived. -Go, go. -Not The Trujillos. -Enjoy the party. -Congratulations. -No, I don't want to. -Yes, of course you do. -Help me, Santiago, please! -Come on. Enjoy the party, Sebastián! Santiago? What's wrong? It's Sebastián. Carolina, don't! It's ross! Look how cute! It has eyes! Really? Nobody uses this. This is just like Eric's, girl. Hey, the toys are great and all, but when is stripper time? [music] No, no. Stay away, asshole. -I said stay away! -Look who's here. I'm sorry, I thought... -Hello. -Hi. How are you? This is like a funeral. It is. Would you go with me to smoke? This is a garden, I think you can do it here. I know, but my Dad doesn't like that I smoke. Come with me. I think I'll wait here. Dude! You've got to see my father's guitar collection. Now? Relax the sacrum. I feel how my iliac crests expand lightly. I let it reach my anus. -No, Pamela. -Hey, hold on. No way! Wow! I told you. I see a spear through me from the perineum to the crown. -And for a moment... -Valeria, are you OK? I forget about my history. Yes, I feel a little low. Why don't you go and grab a bite, then you throw up. -I always do it. -Hey! If she doesn't, she won't fit in the dress. I feel better now. -Why are they on the floor? -I don't know, he likes it. -He's crazy. -A little bit. [music] [Sebastián] No, no, no. Don't. -No. -Where are you going? -Somebody could come in. -Nobody will. -Your father will. -It's locked, OK? -Hey, relax. -Don't. No, I'm not relaxed at all. I'm not, I mean... -You don't like me? -No, that's not it. I'm getting married. This could be your bachelor party, then. Yes, but it isn't. Have you ever had it underwater? What? This isn't OK. Your dad... Valeria... [Carolina] Val... Val are you OK? I feel terrible. What do you mean? Do you want to throw up? [music] -What's wrong? -She's not well. We'd better take her to a hospital. Sebas... is everything OK? Hi. What's wrong? I called you a thousand times, Sebastián. My battery died. What happened, honey? You should have been with me. Please, tell me what happened. [sad music starts] [sad music continues] [sad music ends] PAMELA ASENCIO POSTED ON YOUR WALL. SEBAS, I HAD A BLAST ON FRIDAY. THANKS, HANDSOME. Fucking bitch. Fucking mother fucker! COMMENT, SHARE, DELETE POST Delete, delete. POST DELETED Fucking bitch. "A little girl," said that asshole. No fucking way. [Pamela] Sebas! Are you leaving? [Sebastián] Yes. Pam. Why did you post that on my wall? Oh... Well, I... I didn't know it was wrong. You... get that what happened between us... No, what happened between us? I don't remember anything. Exactly. Thanks. Bye, Pam. Bye! Shit! Hey! You're still up. What is it? You were with her, weren't you? What? With who? Don't act stupid. With Pamela, that night at the party. Of course not! Well, I mean, she was there, but... all the office was there. Besides, she's Mike's daughter. She had to be there. Wasn't she a little girl? She is. Well, I saw her pictures on Facebook and she looks quite grown. Well, yes, but... She's a little girl to me. Did you fuck her? -Come on, Val. -Sebastián! I didn't. I didn't have sex with her. Of course not. I didn't. I'm sorry. I don't know what's going on, I feel I'm going crazy. No. You aren't going crazy. It was a shitty week. Just that. Panda? Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Panda Happy birthday to you My voice is awful. -Hi. -Congratulations. Are you OK? I had to get it off my chest. I wasn't expecting this. Hey, Carolina found a garden for the wedding. It's amazing and really cheap. We can pay in installments, but the first must be done today. I... Well, I was thinking that since there's no rush anymore... I don't know, we could... -Postpone it. -Call it off. What? No, no. I meant postpone it. You don't want to marry me. No, not at all. I meant to postpone it. Because now, we have more time. Wow! You would only marry me because I was pregnant. Honey, I'm just saying that we could take things more slowly. It was the only thing I asked you, Sebastián. Panda, would you listen to me? I do want to marry you, now, we have time to plan a better wedding. -Go. -That's all. -Honey... -Could you leave me alone? -Are you serious, Panda? -Get out, Sebastián! Well... Breathe. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday Dear Sebastián Happy birthday to you -Hurray! -Bravo! NEW MESSAGE I'LL GIVE YOU YOUR GIFT LATER, SEBI Blow the candles! Come on! Come on, son! CHAT-FRIENDS FOREVER THE WEDDING AND THE BIRTHDAY PARTY ARE CANCELED IS EVERYTHING ALRIGHT? NO, IT'S ALL WRONG. SEBASTIAÁN'S AN ASSHOLE I ASKED HIM TO DO IT FOR US, NOT THE BABY, AND HE LIED TO ME I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN THAT'S TERRIBLE. YOU DESERVE BETTER. IT'LL BE ALRIGHT HE'S AN ASSHOLE, I TOLD YOU SO I'LL CALL YOU LATER VAL, TO HELL WITH HIM COME TO PALAZUELA'S PARTY AND HAVE SOME FUN THANK YOU ALL, BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE DOING ANYTHING [music] Come on, stop it. THIS USER HAS BLOCKED YOU [music] Sebastián. I don't know if you've noticed, but Valeria hasn't come in two weeks. So, no matter how much you wait, she won't show up. Where's everyone else? We are short on staff. And Jesús? Don't even mention him. We're not together anymore and he doesn't work here. What happened? He's very gay and, honestly, I'm more heterosexual, more of an alpha male, dude. Right. What went wrong? He made the biggest mistake of his life. Picture this, he told me... that he accepted me for who I was. I mean, I could deal with... Well, that he was a bum bandit, a Peter Puffer, -a pole smoker, a queer... -I get it, man. But that he wants to convince me that I'm gay... No fucking way! Don't you care what you feel for him? Yes, that fucker is dead to me. And you know what? I can accept anything, Sebastián, except liars. They sing in your ear in this beautiful place. I'm not sure this is a good idea. No, no, no. Don't give me that. -When did you last go out? -Let's come back another day. No! Please, don't do this to me. Why are you doing all this for me, Caro? Didn't I tell you? My integral service also includes psychological and moral assistance to unfortunate friends like you. As long as the unfortunate soul is you and only you. Well then. -Shall we go? -Yes. OK, go. Shot! Shot! Shot! Come on. One, two... [music] Cheers! It's a kind of cute, admit it. Isn't it? Thanks for bringing me here. Sorry? Did you say "thanks"? Can you say it louder? Say it loud... What? Why did you kick me? Val? Alonso, what's up? What are you doing here? I'm giving a gig in this hotel. And you? She's celebrating she's single. -We both are. -No, no. -Really? -We're just partying. Well, if you're single, come meet my band. Are they single? -Yes. -Really? Very single. I think I'm going to say hi. It's rude not to greet people. -Bye. -No. -Martín. -You go, girl. I was just thinking of you yesterday. And what were you thinking of? Of all the times you cheated on me? Hi. Hey. Why are you still here? It's midnight. Yes... but we haven't talked in about a month. We talk every day, Pam. Yes, but about boring stuff. I don't know, about work. Can't we talk about... me, perhaps? OK. The same happened to me. She stood me up two weeks before the wedding. All was set. That's terrible. But it worked for me. Because I turned all that pain... and I turned it into creative energy. -God, Alonso! -I turned into the alchemist. -OK. -It's my second album's name. Wow! How would you like to go to talk to a more private place? No. I won't leave my friend on her own. Well... she isn't exactly on her own. We have a problem, Sebastián. No... Which? I think I'm... You're what, Pam? You're...? I think I'm... in love with you, OK? -Is that all? -What? Isn't that enough? -I need you... -No! What are you doing? No, no, stop it. -Listen to me. -Please, stop. -I need you to make love to me. -No. -I can't! -Sebas, just a little! Don't tear off my shirt! -Pam, please! -Hush. What? What is it? -What? -Stop it, Pam. -What? -I love Valeria. And I love you. -I'm being serious. -I'm, too, OK? -Pam, get off me. -What? Come on. -Please, get off. -What are you doing? -Please, get off me. -Come on. -No, get off me. -Come on! Pam. You're really a jerk! I am, get dressed. You know you want it. -Please, get dressed. -You don't like me? Is that it? No, that... That isn't... I can't. I don't want to. They gave me a very cool suite because of the gig. Don't you want to see it? No, Alonso. We'd better go back. No, stop. I can't do this. I swear I can't. Are you rejecting me? Yes. I am rejecting you. What do I do now? That's big. I'd never been rejected. How awkward. Pam... I'm sorry. But... there's always a first time. -No, I mean it. -It's OK. You don't know who you're messing with. Yes, I know. No, you don't. Alonso, stop. Stop, I... -I'm going to Hell. -No... NEW MESSAGE I'M SORRY, SEBI. LET'S BE FRIENDS Fuck! What the fuck! What's wrong with you? You're a murderer! [Sebastián] Fucking psycho! Pamela! NEW MESSAGE I'D RATHER NOT Fucking psycho bitch! I'm going to tell your dad! You're not going to tell anything to anybody, fucker. Otherwise, I'll say you raped me at my dad's party. Who would they believe? What? I told you not to mess with me. Fucking psycho! Valeria, Valeria. Honey, pick up, pick up. SEBASTIAÁN INCOMING CALL Help! -Smile, dude! -Wait, we're going to stumble. Holy crap! You do look handsome! Don't worry, man, with all that morphine, you won't feel a thing. You're a good friend, Alberto. -Thank you. -You should thank the nurses. You owe me a big one. Yes, I owe you a big one. But you're indeed a very good friend, man. We were best friends in high school until you tried to rape me. Come on, don't be a pussy! You can't cut it. So? Shall I take you home? No, take me to Valeria's. I don't think it's wise. Take me to Valeria's, goddamn it! Fine. Friend's number one rule. You don't yell at your best friend. I'm sorry. Write something cool. Best friends, rescue, Alberto. And tag yourself. [Sebastián] No, not the puppy face. Bye, gorgeous. I'll call you. [Valeria] Sebastián? What are you doing here? What happened? I'm OK. I wanted to talk with you. -Look, I... -Val. Please, listen to me. I screw up. We're going through this because of me. But I need you to know you're the love of my life. It's not that I didn't want to marry you... I'm terrified... I might not to be the man you deserve. I'll probably lose you over this... but I need to tell you something. I made many mistakes. Many that I can't make right. But lying to you was the worst. What are you talking about? [sad music] At Mike's party... I was with Pamela. Did you...? -You're an asshole. -Yes. I am. You just got down from Alonso's car. Will you tell me nothing happened? It's not your fucking business. We're not together anymore. [music starts] [music continues] Fucking idiot! [music ends] I was thinking that since we won't work together and you're single now, we could try to... Pamela, I really hope you've enjoyed it, because I don't want to see you again in my fucking life. SEBASTIAÁN INCOMING CALL [sad music] EMPTY TRASH? [sad music] NEW MESSAGE MOMENTS VALERIA, PLEASE FORGIVE ME I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU [sad music] Really, Sebastián? Will you go on? What else can I do? I lost the love of my life. Yes, sure. It's perfectly OK not to have a job, right? Man, listen. Why don't you download one of those Apps to shake the sheets? Did you say, "shake the sheets"? It was too much, right? I'm sorry, I visited my mom yesterday. I'm not interested. Well, you should be, because after the stupid act you pulled, I doubt you have another chance. I know, trust me. But I only love her. I love Valeria, my Valeria. -So, stop whining and find her! -Where? She won't answer my calls or answer my messages. I may know where she'll be tomorrow. What? Jesús posted on Facebook they'd go to a concert. Didn't he block you on Facebook? Yes, but I created a fake profile with one of his fairy friends' picture. What? I miss him a lot, man. -Damn, you're a genius! -What? Where are you going? No way, miss. We're going to this concert together. I'm not in the mood, Chucho. There are two options, and we didn't want to tell you, but... Either you let him go or... -You call him. -What? No way! God, Valeria! Why are you so hard on him? He wasn't the only one who... -Right? -I'm sorry for that. I hate you. [music] Well, before we go on, I've a surprise for you. A very dear friend asked me a favor. He has a very important message for the girl he loves. Thanks a lot, Rodrigo. Valeria, I know you're here and we can't undo our mistakes. But I think we can... begin again... always. Hold me I don't want to see you Disappear Forgive me I didn't mean to hurt you That time We crashed And burned unknowingly Against the break of day And in a thousand pieces On your skin I stayed We uncovered ourselves Until we vanished Lost in the moment I gave in And when we forgot it... -Hold on, they'll see you. -I don't care, faggot. We were born again Panda... Would you marry me? ["Caderas blancas" playing] ["Caderas blancas" continues] Yes, I do. She said yes! [Valeria] So, what is love? I don't know the precise words to answer that. [Sebastián] Love is incredible, but it's not perfect, right? It's wonderful, but oftentimes it's not easy. [Valeria] Love is everything. It's indeed sharing and commitment. [Sebastián] But it's also to recognize we aren't perfect and we make mistakes. [Valeria] To give yourself completely and unconditionally. To take a leap of faith despite the fear. [Sebastián] Love is to face the world, together. To forgive and begin again. [Valeria] For better... or for worse.
