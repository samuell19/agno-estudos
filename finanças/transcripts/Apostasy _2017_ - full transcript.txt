[Alex praying] I'm sorry, Jehovah. I'm ashamed really. The doctor went on about my condition. She didn't care before. It's a big deal to her now I'm turning 18, 'cause it's my decision now, you see. She even said-- [indistinct] [Alex] She was convinced that the hospital saved my life when I was born and that my congregation tried to stop it. But you do realize that the reason you're alive is because the hospital gave you blood when you were first born, when the priests tried to stop it from happening. Elders, not priests. [Alex praying] She don't understand. I mean, can you believe she tried to do a deal with me? She was willing to give me another transfusion if I ever needed one again, but without telling anyone. She said it'd be private like, between me and her. No one needed to know. [Doctor] And I wouldn't tell your mum or anyone in the community. She did it well. You could tell she cared, in a way. [Ivanna] So, you didn't give it to her? [door opens] [Ivanna] That should do it. Can you put it on Alex's records? It's up to date, and we've had two witnesses sign it. [Doctor] Do you really know what this means? She understands. Some of these alternatives might not work if you get really anemic, which would put your life at risk. [Ivanna scoffs] That's just your opinion. Come on. You can't be too careful now. I'm sorry, Mum. You're all right. How do you know, Mum... if you'll make it into the New System? You do your best. Some elders wonder if they'll make it. What I mean is... no one knows how God will judge them. So, you can't ever be sure, then? [clock ticking] Look at this, Alex. [Alex] It was the first time I'd seen all these boys and girls who had died for Jehovah. I was such a coward compared to these lot. This one girl, Emma, she was amazing. She told the judge that they were abusing her body, and that she'd rip the needle out if they tried to give her blood. So, the hospital let her go home. She died in peace, in her mum's arms. I wish I'd talked to my doctor like that, so brave like. [Ivanna] It just goes to show, blood is the life force. It was so clear now. [Ivanna] There's no such thing as "the soul." Mum made it clearer than ever. That's for false religions, like airy-fairy Catholics. There's the body, and blood, and it's Jehovah's design. And to mess with it is the worst sin. Not to mention worldly diseases, like AIDS and... HIV. Before we knew what these diseases even were, God had warned us about them in the scriptures. [clock ticking] I ask for your forgiveness, Jehovah, for my doubts. I pray you give me strength and guidance. In Jesus' name. - Morning. - Morning. - How you feeling? - I feel okay. Let me look at you. What's that? - The bank sent it you? - Mm. You should send it them back. I'm gonna squeeze an hour in on the trollies at lunch. Can you...? Thank you. I've made you some eggs, they're in the microwave. - You two take care today, okay? - Yes. God's name is Jehovah. God's name is Jehovah. [Luisa scoffs] You're gonna get car sick. So, how you feeling, anyway? I'm okay. [Luisa] I can't believe you're 18 today. The time's flying. [chuckles] What? I remember when Mum and Aunty Linda went to one of those. [laughs] Yeah. They didn't know at the time, and then when they got there, they were told it was a Buddhist practice. [both laugh] [Alex] Imagine Mum's face. I know. She was fuming at Aunty Linda. She swore the Devil had tricked her into it. If you could end one problem in the world, what would it be? [Brother Jatin] Good pronunciation. So, what might be the usual response to that, in our territory? Unemployment. [Brother Jatin] Yeah. So, you could follow up with... The Bible says that God will soon bring an end to all suffering. Isaiah 65:22 would be the best example here. [pages rustling] Alex, would you like to give that a go? [clears throat] "They will not build, for someone else to inhabit nor will they plant for others to eat." [Brother Jatin] Good. Look, it's not easy learning to teach the Bible in another language, but what you're doing is worth it. So, let's try enjoy it today, and keep in mind the words of Matthew 24:14, "It's only once everyone has heard the name Jehovah, that's when the New System will arrive." [knocking on door] [door creaks open] - Salaam. - Salaam. [Man] Salaam. [clears throat] If you could end one problem in the world... - Who is it? - I don't know. ...uh, what would it be? How come you speak Urdu? To talk about God's promise, look in God's word. What book is that? God's word. What book? God wants you to live in paradise on Earth. He made that clear in your book as well as ours. It don't really matter which book. But, uh... This magazine explains how God will soon bring an end to all suffering. And according to the Bible, you can choose where you will spend eternity. And it tells you everything in this leaflet. So, you can have a look. II' [silverware clatters] [rhythmic chopping] [cabinet creaks] My art class has been changed this term. It's on a Thursday night now. Is there not another module you could take on a different day? Well, you can't miss meetings just because of college. I know, I just need to do this one class, so I can finish the course. The problem with this world is that people let things like art or music take over their lives, and it becomes a religion to them. Imagine when Jesus comes back at Armageddon to destroy this world. How is he gonna feel when you're at college instead of with his organization at the meetings? [Michelle] And then, we went through the main factory where all the magazines get printed. And from there, they go out all around the world. Never been to Bethel, never been to London. [Michelle] Oh, you must go. It's so inspiring like... to see all those brothers and sisters living and working there. How amazing would it be to dedicate your life like that, and not have to do secular work? Have, um... Have you guys ever heard of demons tormenting people? [scoffs] Why? Because I... I think there's one in the attic. - Are you being daft? - No. No, I'm being serious. I can hear it up there making noises all night. It's just house noise. No. No. Look, demons do it. I mean, look, they mess... They mess with brothers and sisters, right, that... - That happens. - [Alex] Right. And there's not much time left, and you might think this is a joke, but I can... it's like I can physically feel them trying to pull me away from the truth. - It's probably just house noise. - No! No. 'Cause like, it's... It's there. It's just... [growling] [laughs] - And then I pray, and it just stops! - [snaps fingers] And then the next night, it's there again. [Michelle] Are you sure you're not up to no good? Yeah. Why would a demon be in your house? Don't you have to summon one first? I don't know. I don't-- A previous owner, maybe? You think I should call an elder? They'll think you've gone mental if you do that. [chuckles nervously] Could you pass me the bag? [leaves rustling] [shovel scraping dirt] [indistinct chattering] [muffled music thumping over stereo] [Luisa] Guys, this is my sister. Alex, this is Chloe, and this is Umar. - [Alex] Hey. - You all right? I'm just dropping these off, okay. [Chloe] So, what do you do? - Uh, I've got... I've got a gardening job. - Ah. But we also pioneer. Oh, what's that? It's what some Jehovah's Witnesses do. You guys are Jehovah's Witnesses? No way! You never said. That's cool. One of my neighbors is a Jehovah. [Alex] You know, the Greek word "stauros" is what they used when writing the Bible. But the word "stauros" doesn't actually mean "cross," it means "upright stake" or "pole." It was only in the fourth century, when Christianity came, that the word changed meaning. So, you see, Jesus wasn't actually nailed to a cross, he was nailed to an upright stake. The cross is a pagan symbol used by false religions. She don't wanna know all that. - I just thought you should know. - Well, it's a bit disrespectful. [Chloe] It's okay. [Umar] So, what do you guys believe in then? Going to heaven or what? Come on, I'm serious. I wanna know. God is gonna restore Earth back to paradise, how he intended it to be. Like in Genesis, that's where we'll live. [scoffs] Right. So, what about everyone who ain't a Jehovah's? God'll decide what's in their hearts, but if they refuse to listen, then they'll be removed. Well, so what's so wrong with this world? It says in the Bible, that this whole world is in the power of the wicked one, Satan. - I don't know about all that. It's mad. -[Chloe] Yeah. [Luisa] Yeah, well, you have to admit, things happen that aren't right. You know, all these wars all the time. And cruelty to animals and that. Do you know, in Africa, they kill thousands of rhinos a year, and they'll become extinct soon just because of how greedy mankind is at the moment. Aw. Sad, isn't it? I love rhinos. - [bell rings] - Uh-oh. Get yourself wrapped up. [birds chirping] [paper rustling] Look. I haven't told anyone else. - Mum-- - Shush. Who's the father? Is he a brother? It's... It's a guy from college. Were you even going to tell us if this didn't happen that you were messing with a worldly boy? You should have told us. Look what's happened. You've let college go to your head. I need you to start bringing him to meetings. You have to start bringing him to meetings. It's not gonna happen. Do you love him? Then you need to marry him and start bringing him to meetings. I can't, Mum. [Ivanna] It's the only way. Have you even talked to him about the truth? He don't care. Inn: So, you've just decided to forget everything? II' [Alex praying] I know she still has you in her heart, Jehovah. Maybe just not as strong. I did pray the elders would see that. [Elder Brian] I'm sorry, Ivanna. How could they disfellowship her? [Ivanna] But she still wants to be in God's organization. She's shown little sign of repentance. I don't understand. [Elder Alan] Maybe you haven't noticed, but we can see, at this point, she's really lost her relationship with Jehovah. [Elder Brian] We hope she works on that, really builds it back. If you'd told us she was falling away, maybe we could have helped. - What should I do? - Jehovah's direction is clear about avoiding any contact with wrongdoers. [Ivanna] But she needs help and support now. [Elder Brian] We realize it's tough. You must keep any necessary contact to a bare minimum. [Brother Jatin] It's true, Ivanna. The less contact, the more it'll help Luisa realize her error quicker. - [footsteps shuffle] - [zipper rasps] [water running] Alex. [sighing deeply] [engine starts] [car leaving] She'll be back. [Elder Alan] Sixty pounds for gas and electricity. Water was twenty pounds. And the hall cleaning will be handled by the Drakefield street group this month. One more announcement this week. Luisa Whitling is no longer one of Jehovah's Witnesses. Thank you. [indistinct murmuring] [MEX] Sorry. - What's that about? - It was probably fornication. Who'd have thought? [clock ticking] [car approaching] [rain pattering] Alex. I've just come to get some bits, okay. [rain pattering] [Umar and Luisa speaking indistinctly] [footsteps descending] [footsteps ascending] [footsteps descending] [Luisa] Alex... [rain pattering] You're not gonna say anything? Do you think this is easy for me? [Alex praying] Maybe I... Maybe I did think it was easy for her. She always just did as she pleased. If it's hard for her, then maybe... maybe she'll come back. Maybe she does need your guidance. [car door slams] Let's go. Come on. You got everything? [Luisa sighs] [door slams] Mum asked me what I said, but I told her don't worry. I knew I hadn't broke any rules. [clock ticking] [engine starts] [car leaving] [clock ticking] [indistinct chattering] [pop music playing quietly] What do you think? Mum? Is it too revealing? I can see your knicker line. With an underskirt, it will be all right. Okay. [meditative music playing softly] II' [indistinct chattering] - Hello there. - Hello. - I'm Steven. - Oh. I'm a new elder here. I transferred here this week. Nice to meet you. - What's your names? - I'm Ivanna. This is Alex. Alex is a member of our Urdu congregation. I can speak myself, Mum. Urdu? That's fantastic. Serving where the need is great. Thank you. Well, I just wanted to say hi, so... hi. [all chuckle] I'll see you around, Sisters. Hi. Steve. [clock ticking] - [Ivanna] Alex. - [Steven] I don't want to disturb. I thought Steven was doing a shepherding call, but he's just here to... Well... - Do you want a brew? - No, thanks. I'll wait in the sitting room. I didn't mean to just drop in uninvited. No, that's okay. I live close by. Are you sure you don't want a drink or something? - Maybe just a water. - Yeah, sure. - I'll just, um... - Yeah, of course. [Alex] Where abouts do you live? Just up the road. Near the precinct. The flats there, they're not as bad as they look. [both chuckle] Do you live on your own? Yeah, my parents are down south. I just go wherever I need to go, really. [Alex] Your parents are in the truth? Mm. Yeah, they... They both grew up in it. I like your accent. [clears throat] Um... I wanted to speak with you... 'cause I'd like to get to know you. - Sorry. Was that too on the nose? - No, it's all right. I just, I don't... I don't know if you'd like me if you really got to know me. - What... What do you mean? - Nothing, sorry. You've got a nice house. So just you and your mum live here? Uh, yeah. Well, I've got my sister as well, but she was disfellowshipped. Yeah, I heard actually. Will she come back, do you think? Hopefully. [Steven] I'll pray for her. Mum's keeping guard. [chuckles] [paper rustles] [Ivanna] Thank you for calling, Steven. - Yeah, see you. - Bye-bye. - [telephone ringing] - Oh. - Bye. - Don't work too hard. [both chuckle] [Ivanna] You know how I feel. You can either continue to play house with this boy or you repent. [clock ticking] Your sister's having a girl. [indistinct chattering] Hey. - Hi. - Sorry, I know you gotta go in. Um... [clears throat] Husk, uh... I just wondered if you and your mum wanted to come to mine for dinner? Uh... Yeah, I'd need to check with her, but yeah. Great. - All right, see you in a bit. - See you. [indistinct conversation] - [Man] Alex. - Hi. [indistinct conversation continues] It's serious, you know, if you're gonna court Steven. Marriage is still one of the few things that are sacred. It's not like in this world, where vows are thrown about like rubbish and all brides are loose women. I know, Mum. I think Steven's really nice. He is. He's very suitable. [traffic whooshing distantly] [dishes clattering] [taps window] - You don't need to do that, Ivanna. - I don't mind. No. No, it's fine. Honestly. I can do it. - Okay. - All right. Cheers. [Alex] I had a nice time. We could do all right, us. You know, I've got my window cleaning job, and you've got your gardening. I think, between the two of us, I think we'd do all right, I reckon. Anyway, I'm working towards becoming a circuit overseer, as soon as possible. Then we won't have to worry about money. The Society'll take care of us until the New System. I need to tell you, I have a... I have a condition. Like, I get anemic. When I was born, I had to have a transfusion. Mum and the elders couldn't do anything about it, the hospital forced it into me. We don't talk about it, really. Are you... Are you okay now? Yeah, I'm fine. I mean, they say it might, you know, get worse, but, you know, I'm fine. I'm okay. Have I freaked you out? [Steven chuckles] I was reading the literature, just before, about the differences between infatuation and love. It said one of the first signs of love is that it can overcome obstacles where infatuation would just run a mile. I know the brothers on the Hospital Liaison Committee if you... if you need assistance with medical stuff. Yeah. II' [Alex praying] I'm sorry, Jehovah, if I doubted the kindness of my brothers and sisters. [Elder Brian] Morning, Alex. How are you? - Steven. - Hiya. Good to see you. [Alex praying] It is special to be part of your organization. Alex. Take one, love. [Alex] They look delicious. [Steven] Wow. Steven has a kind heart. I just pray now that my sister will remember what it's like to be part of your love. II' What's going on? I've just come to sort things out. I've... I've left Umar. You know we miss you. We could help you with the baby. You should come back here. And, you know, come to meetings with us, then it'll all be okay. You still believe, don't you? I read things online. [Ivanna] Like what? People say things about us. People out there are bitter, and they want to put evil ideas into your head. You know, we believed Armageddon was supposed to come in 1975? Some Brothers even sold their houses that year, and they took their kids out of school. - What are you talking about? - They're old truths, Luisa. Anyway, some brothers misunderstood the message back then and got carried away. It's okay to have doubts, but we have to be humble. If you don't understand something, talk to the elders, pray to Jehovah. Deep down, you know we're God's people. There's no other religion out there that is as true to His word. Mum... I just came here to see if we could... be normal. Without this. It don't work like that. So, this goes on forever then? - [Ivanna] Where you gonna go now? - [Luisa] Piss off! [door slams] [chopping continues] The pain and suffering the world over is going to be immense. Those who choose not to believe will be destroyed at Armageddon. Let's not forget the words in Jeremiah. "They will not be mourned "nor will they be gathered up or buried. They will become like manure on the surface of the ground." [rain pattering] [hail pattering] [pattering grows louder] [loud knocking] [muffled music playing] 'Hiya! - Hiya! Hi, Alex. - You must be Steven. - Yeah. - I'm Linda. - Hiya. Come in. What you doing? No, put that down, love. - I want a drink. - Go wait in the other room. Go on. Go on. Go on. Now, we've got spag bol or chili. What do you fancy? [Steven] Chili, please. [Linda] Oh, for drinks, we've got cider. Put your coats over there. There you go. All right? Gonna introduce us? This is Steven. - Hi, Steven. Barry. - Oh, yeah. - You all right? - Nice to meet you. I hear you're a Bethelite? What's that like, working there? [Steven] Yeah, it's good. [Michelle] Come on, Alex. We've been waiting for you. Oh, I'm Michelle, by the way. - Yeah, hi. - Do you want to come dance with us? Um... [coughs] - Wash it down with some Scrumpy's. - Yeah. [giggles] Cheers. Oof. - Hot? - Yeah. It was the week of the school, and it was my turn to say the dinnertime prayer, and the Elder Steve says, "Would you say the prayer for us?" And immediately, as I finished, he says, "That was a bit short." Quick as a flash, I said to him, "Jehovah listens to our prayers, it doesn't matter," and everyone laughed. [Linda] Okay now, shh. You'll love this. - [Man] Yes. - [Woman] Hi. Okay, and... This baby is mine! I warned her not to roll over in the night. I said be careful. Her baby died, but now she's took mine! Lies! I told her the same. What proof do you have? I know my child. Jehovah, help me! I will cut the baby in two pieces! But, Solomon, you can't cut the baby in half. Let her have him. But don't kill her! Please! Yeah, go ahead. Chop it in half. Am I bothered? [laughter] [Solomon] A true mother doesn't want to see her baby die.

II' [muffled voices chattering] [Ivanna] Steven, can you get some water for her? [vehicles passing] [water running] If you can just sign there, love, it takes about a week for it to be assessed. Thank you. Bye. You Okay? Yeah. [clock ticking] [Elder Brian] It's been a while since I've had to do one of these. Will her father be coming? Ivanna, I'm happy to help. Is it okay if Luisa comes? [clock ticking] [Elder Brian] It's okay... Of course. If she wants. [line ringing] Luisa? [quiet chattering] [Luisa] I should sit there. My glasses aren't steaming up because I'm crying. It's because it's warm in here. And that's how you felt whenever you were with Alex. She was shy... but she radiated Jehovah's love. Ivanna told me recently that Alex would sometimes worry about how Jehovah would judge her. When I heard that, I was knocked back. Here's this sister who has dedicated her whole youth to Jehovah... and yet even she worried about how Jehovah felt about her. How humble she was. Well... let's see how Jehovah feels about Alex. Job 14, verse 15. "They will call... and I myself shall answer." I think about that, and how Jehovah is really looking forward to bringing this amazing sister back to life again. Now we all know the New System is near. We all share a hope that we will survive this system, and go right through the Great Tribulation into paradise. But for Alex, she knew the difficult decision that she had to make, but she accepted that. She mustered up incredible courage, because she knew that God was looking after her. Brian's speech was very good, wasn't it? [Luisa sniffling] You don't need to do that. [sighs] Mum... [sniffles] The last thing I said to her was "piss off." She was just trying to help. You'll see her again. [Luisa crying] [sobbing] [sobbing loudly] You know what you need to do? Yeah. II' [Male Narrator] It hurts so much when we lose a loved one. The thought of living without them makes our hearts ache. But let's not forget the promise that Jehovah God has made. "I am the resurrection and the life. "He that exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life." However, when a loved one passes away, it still creates immense sorrow and anguish deep inside us. That's because it isn't supposed to be this way. [through TV] Death is the result of sin. Our first parents rebelled against Jehovah, passing down years of suffering and grief that was never designed for mankind. Jehovah wanted us to live forever in an earthly paradise. And he still does! Soon enough, we will see our loved ones again. [water sloshing gently] [ducks quacking] [indistinct conversation] [Steven] You know, you plan to continue your life, but it could all just be pointless... if Armageddon comes early. Do you think it's possible that Alex will be able to marry in the New System? We can't be sure, can we? Jesus said, the resurrected ones won't be able to marry. I know, but... we don't know if he was talking about those in Heaven, or the resurrected ones on Earth. We just don't know... Who's to say? Marriage might not even be in the New System. You can move on with your life. I say that because I care about you. [ROW] It was in the paper today... about your kid. Alex. Did you see it, in the paper? I thought it was quite tragic. [meditative music playing] [Ivanna praying] Alex was part of me, Jehovah. I'll never forget what she did. How foolish Satan must look now in face of such a faith. I used to feel like Luisa was sending me mad. I was so crazy with worry all the time. I even thought about getting some sort of counseling. I'm so pleased now, O Jehovah... And so, we ask this through your son and our redeemer, Jesus Christ. Amen. [All] Amen. We now welcome Brother Alan to the platform. - [whispering] Dad! - Shh. Dad, why didn't she pray with us? [Father] Shh. She's not allowed. [Steven] Had a good chat with her, and she said that she's been praying. Hmm. Alex's influence has brought her back. [Elder Brian] She's finally on the right path. But there's a way to go. We'll start her guidance meetings. Is it okay if I start to help her now, just with a few practical things? The rules still apply until she's ready for reinstatement. How long... How long will that take? [Elder Brian] That's up to Luisa. There's no set time. Reinstatement can take from a couple of months to a few years. [Steven] We'll do our best. She's all alone now, and in her condition... she could do with a bit of support. Ivanna, we can't stop you. And we understand there maybe a need for some contact with her to care for her. But... be careful. Of course. I wouldn't risk Luisa's faith now. Contact must be kept to a minimum. First Corinthians five explains to us how we must avoid socializing or eating with the wrongdoer. Only necessary business is okay. Luisa's in a delicate position now. [Luisa] Hey. I know I can't offer you anything. [Luisa sighs] I was a bit sick this morning. Do you wanna sit down? I'll get to work. [spraying] Thanks, Mum. Ring me if you need owt, and I'll see you at the hall. - Mum... - Just listen to the elders. It... It'll be fine. I just... I just can't... I just can't believe it. I just never imagined that... you know, she would do it. She did because Jehovah is real. She was so certain, wasn't she? We'll all be together again soon, in the New System. In a few hundred years, we probably won't even remember any of this. I best go. [door opens] [door closes] In Russia, it's hard for the brothers. They still persecute us there. Well, it's a good thing really. - Who wants another? - I'm good, thanks. What Jews did to Jesus. They banned us in Moscow, made bible studies illegal. Well, if they do liquidate us, then that means we're no longer considered a faith. How's it going with Luisa? Her guidance meetings? Um... Okay. She, uh... She understands the truth, but... um, we're just trying to make sure that it's in her heart. She's responding well, but... she's just not quite there yet. What's the problem? Her... Her answers just aren't right sometimes. She likes to voice her own opinions too much, but then she gets it eventually. It's very important to me that she gets reinstated. She's on the right path. You should be more careful. You shouldn't look for an excuse to associate. - I wasn't. - It doesn't help. It just... It just undermines what we're trying to do. You know, by supporting us, that would be the best help. Look, I know this is not what you're trying to do, but... if there's no real reason for the contact, then it could be classed as a disfellowshipping offense. [Man] We leave this meeting in your care and ask that your blessing be upon it. Through the name of your son Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. So, we look forward to special week of activity this week whilst we have our circuit overseer Brother Stevenson and his wife with us. And we'd like to welcome him to the platform to present the first in a series of talks that he's prepared for us. "God's Word, A Light to your Roadway." Brother Stevenson. We've got the meeting with the circuit overseer on Friday. Oh, and one of the other congregations is using the hall-- [Ivanna] Steven. Can I have a word? Do you know why Luisa's not here? Um... we tried to call in on her... but she said she wasn't feeling too well. Okay. Okay. [knocking] I tried to call you. Are you okay? Steven said you weren't well. The midwife said she wasn't growing. I had a scan. Is everything okay? I've gotta have another one in two weeks. You need to take care of yourself. Have you been eating properly and staying hydrated? I brought you some food and bits. I'll make you something healthy. [Ivanna] I'll eat in there. [sniffles] So, tell us what you've done to show repentance? [Luisa] I've been going to all the meetings that I could possibly. [Elder Brian] Right. I've respected not associating with family and others. [Elder Brian] Right. Um... I've been able to pray about it. [Elder Brian] That's good. We'd hoped you'd have asked for Jehovah's guidance. Now, we've still got an issue with the relationship with your family. - Yeah, well-- - It's just that we know that your mother continues to go around to your house. Yeah, but after all that's happened... You're not policemen of my life. [Elder Brian] That's not what we're doing. [Luisa, muffled] Please be human. Please! I have been on my own for seven months, and my mum helps me with house work sometimes. I haven't been to eat with her, we haven't been out together. So, please show me where it says that my mum can't help me. I have done the best that I can, but my mum cleans my fridge! [Elder Alan] Personally, I don't think that's "necessary family business." [Luisa] You know what? I... I cannot do this. I can't! - I can't do it! - [footsteps approach] [sobbing, sniffling] I'm sorry, Mum. I'm sorry. But the elders, honest, it's no good. They just want to see how you feel. They think they have a right over my whole life. [Ivanna] Just calm down a bit. Steven, Luisa's just... She's feeling a bit tired and emotional at the moment. Look, Luisa, it's no one's fault. We just feel that you need time. It's nothing to worry about. We can still continue our guidance meetings. Do you wanna... Do you wanna go back in and sort it out? [keys jangling] No. Luisa, it's okay. We can... We can sort out another meeting. Do you know how it feels... to think Jehovah the Almighty is punishing you directly, all the time? Why, when I'm sorry? I've tried, Mum. But the elders, they've got it in for me. - No, don't be daft. - Yes, they do. Do you think it's right how they make you treat me? It's not God's way. You need to earn His love. It's conditional. It takes strength to live up to His standards. Strength, I pray, you will find soon. I'm not doing it, Mum. You can visit us if you want. In secret. None of this anymore, okay? Excuse me. [engine starts] [clock ticking] [whimpering] [sobbing] [clock ticking] - [voices murmuring] - [throat clears] [clears throat] Let's turn to Luke 12:49. "I came to start a fire on the Earth. "Do you think I came to bring peace? "No, but rather division." Now, unfortunately, there might come a time when this division of Jehovah's can happen to us, and it can cause pain and distress for a long time. And that is when someone close to our hearts... is disfellowshipped. In a moment of doubt, you might beg Jehovah, why do this to me and my family? Jesus clearly stated in Luke 12 that his work could cause conflict in the household. But we must put Jehovah first, even before our family members if they are disfellowshipped. And be prepared, we might end up facing criticism from outsiders who question our loyalty to God. Even your unrepentant child might say... "My own mum shuns me." But remember, it was a choice. They chose to cut themselves off from God. In a situation like this, it's important to stay hopeful. Even if... Even if your loved one seems unrepentant. It might take them many years before they truly want to return. We just don't know. So please don't try and bend the rules. How bad would it be if we disobeyed and associated, and then one day your daughter comes back and says, "Why did you break Jehovah's command?" Imagine that. [scoffs] But what if instead, she said, "Thank you." Your actions brought me back to the truth. Even if we could get involved in the life of the disfellowshipped one, which we can't, our help would never match up to that of Jehovah's. He understands what they need more than anyone, even the most caring mother. [continuing, muffled] Trust in Him. The right path isn't an easy one. [Steven through speaker] But we have resources of God's wisdom that excels our feeble, human logic. If God was to say that this book is green when it's actually red, then maybe it is green. What do I really know? Such is His guidance. [applause] [knocking on door] [whispers] Hello. Hello. This is Leanne. Hey. Hey. [Ivanna] She's a good weight. Yeah, she's feeding well. [Leanne cooing] Why now, Mum? I wanted to see my granddaughter. I love you both very much. Why don't you come back? [Leanne fussing] [Leanne crying] [softly] It's okay- Shh. There you go. Why don't you sit down, Mum? I don't get it. What about the New System? Do you not want to see your sister again? [Luisa] You know, all that stuff about blood... in the Bible, the governing body, they just make it up, and then change it whenever they want. But people die because of it. It... It wasn't her fault. I know every single day of Alex's life, she felt shame because she had somebody else's blood inside her. She... She tried very hard to prove herself, but in the end, she made a stand. She stayed loyal to Jehovah, right to the end. I don't feel guilty about you anymore. You let the Devil tempt you, and you'll let yourself die because of it. I could've been there for Alex. But they stopped me with their stupid rules. You know, I just... I just don't get how you could... sit there and watch her die. I still want to see my granddaughter. How do you see that working? [Ivanna] I could pick her up. Me and you won't socialize. I could take her to meetings. - There's no way, Mum. - She needs to know about God. Leanne's not gonna have anything to do with that! [sighs] Mum... I don't blame you, really. And I get it. I get you won't want to talk to us again. But I will be here if you ever need me. Could I have some water? [Leanne fusses] [crying] [softly] It's okay. - [Leanne fussing] - It's okay. [Luisa] Mum! Mum, what are you doing? [Leanne crying] Oh, um... I'll pick her up from nursery and I'll take her to meetings. I'll save her. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [voices chattering, laughing] [chatter, laughter continuing] - [bird squawking] - [children shouting playfully] [chatter, laughter continuing] ♪ ♪
