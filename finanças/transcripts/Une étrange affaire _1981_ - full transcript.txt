A STRANGE AFFAIR Two jacks & an ace. It's his turn. - How much am I up to? - 1008. - You're rich, huh? - Shut up. - What time is it? - 7:50. - Damn. I gotta run. - What? Quitting? Yeah, we said three rounds, let's cash in. - Hello! - Hi! ... Bye, freaks! - It's been long since it started? - It's almost done. I bet hundred to one he's not really dead. - You know, I had worse bosses. - Sure. - When is the new one coming? - Seems he's here. - Here? - Donnow. - Apparently the new one's here. - Yep... Over there. - Where? - Tall, third row. Interesting. - Now you've outdone yourself. - Went to the funeral. - Whose funeral? - Fausse's of course. - He's dead? - I told you. Day before yesterday. Cancer. I thought he was doing better. My razor. - There. - Where? - On the right. That's its place. It goes on the left. - What's wrong? - We'll be working round the clock. I told you. - Why? - Saw the new boss: 3-piece suit, legion of honor... velvet hand in an iron glove. - It's the other way around. - What do you mean? Supposed to be an iron hand. Anyway, all services will take a hit, for sure. Good morning! You know who came up with the word of the day? - The word of the day? - Yeah. - Wait... Is it funny or dumb? - Dumb. - Doutre! - Spot on. We are--brace yourself--"a ship without a captain caught in a storm." - You don't say. - Good morning, Mr. Doutre! - Ah, Coline. Feels weird without him, it's like, can't describe it... A ship without a captain, Coline! - That's it exactly. - Ah, yes. A ship without a captain. So, you've seen the new boss in the church? But that's not him. Really? - So who is he? - That we don't know, but it's not him. He's not in Paris. He arrives Thursday. From Basil. - His name, you know that much? - I'm not authorized to say at the moment. Well, then, don't say it. Etienne, this is Louis. Hey, Lens vs. Bastia, I bet on Lens 2 to 1, ok? Plus, remember, Leclerc doesn't play, it's a gift. Everything white. He ordered some designer furniture for a 100 grand. Hello, ladies and gentlemen! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Here's my expense list. - Are your balance sheets done? - My balance sheets for what? - Listen, he wants a rundown everything: expenditure curves, sales impact, estimates, and all the rest. - Well, but me, after all... - Make it up. Just do something. In any case, there's no rush. He's still in Basil. He's in Madrid and arrives tomorrow. What I'd like to know is why the hell he's in Split. - Split? - Where's that? - That's Yugoslavia, isn't it? - In Yugoslavia. - Is he a communist, or what? - Mercenary. - What do you mean mercenary? - Mercenary... He inspected their food distribution from A to Z posing as a Thomson representative negotiating a contract... All those turnkey factories in Africa... ... that's him! And it's he who revived mail order. He failed only in oil. There's more! Malair... Bertrand Malair, that's his name. What's he like? Young, old? He must not be fond of photographers. I've never seen his picture. It's going to hurt. I don't care. Thirty years of seniority, that will cost them. I'll redeem my points whenever they like. Whenever they like. - Can't find a parking space? - I'm not coming. I'm going to see a film by Ozu with Sophie. Would you like to come? - Oh, no... - See you later, then! - So what do I tell them? - Tell them the truth. Ok, then. - Ah, it's you! Yes, I'll hold. Dr. Robert, hurry please. What? What time will he be back? How can I reach him? Could you take a message for him? Tell him to come tonight, as soon as he can. It's my mother. Calm down, buddy, stay! Are you almost done? - She's on the phone? - And what do you think? The doctor won't get here before 9. Look at her! It's not because I'm dead that she's crying! - It's because I'm not dead! - Stop it! - Get up! Your dress will get wrinkled. - Where's your wife? - She's not here yet? - No. Well, she'll be here. It's not too terrible, what is it? - It's Bartisol, you want more? - No, it's ok. - Should we wait for her? - No, she must have been delayed. - Let's eat before it gets cold. - Rather burned! In any case, she hardly eats. She's an intellectual. Well, Veronica, sit next to Louis. I'll keep Ren? to myself. Nina will sit over there. And then... Well, that's it. 1950. It was 52-53, in a Ren? Clair film. - You had a nice little scene at the cleaner's. It was 52. I'm sure of it. Louis was 14 months old. 1950, try and remember! He was 14 months. Ren? Clair even thought I was too young to be a mother. You were how old then? 18? I was 16, and I had just given birth to Louis! Without makeup, she was even prettier, you know. But what are you trying to tell me, Ren?? That I'm a slut? If she had listened to me, she'd be Mich?le Morgan today. But what can you do? With her character... Still no news of your father, naturally. Would you like me to walk Filo? Come on, boy, come on. Going back now. Run along, my friend. - It's all right. He's relieved himself! - Filo! - Come, Filo, come here! - Bye now! - How was it? - Fine, as usual. Another one! Yep, but this one is superb! Look. Baby mother. And you? You were right not come. You wouldn't have liked it. - Did you like it? - Yes. That's good. In the end, they realize they love each other. For real. You would have liked that? With another woman? No. Sometimes I'd like to be a man. What's bothering you? Something at the office? I'm not sure if they won't let me go. Who "they"? The new boss? Malair, that's his name. Wait till you've met him. He might be cool. When is he coming? Don't know. No one knows. Not even where he is, so... I'm there. You didn't wake me up! I'm not working this morning. Hello! Doutre? I'm sorry I'm at a car mechanic's. They say there's water in the carburetor, so... Listen, Coline, in any case, we've nothing urgent to work on. So, take it easy, ok? Myself, I'm in and out. Mrs. Doutre isn't feeling well. Anyway, not till Thursday. His office isn't ready, yet. Ah, Miss Pr?, can I buy you a coffee? You know very well I don't like coffee True, true. Serge, make me a coffee, would you? So, the estimates, curves, rundowns, etc., all cool? He can come, everything's done. I'm ready for him. Good, good. Hello, Mrs. Liliane! If Mr. Willy gets on your nerves, come to me. What's all this? I've asked you a question, Mr. Coline. What's all this stuff? It's mine. All this is mine. I suspected as much. I don't like to go through people's things but I was getting bored, and you weren't coming. My name is Malair. Excuse me. Bertrand Malair. Your door was open. What is it that you do exactly? I'm Gerard Doutre's assistant. I'm in ads... In the advertising division. You live in the 15th arrondissement? Nice neighborhood! - You smoke? - Yes. What is this? Gitanes. Mr. Doutre smokes lights. I'll go get them. Is he a nice guy, this Doutre? - No more than that, huh? - He's a good guy. Anyway, he's smokes the right stuff. You see, Mr. Coline, every time I come to a new establishment, it's the same thing: I get jitters. Everyone knows each other, it's a closed hostile world. Do you realize my discomfort? - No? - Yes, I can imagine. This afternoon, we'll be officially introduced. If you wish, - we'll act as if we'd never met. - Ok. We should turn up the heat... Mr. Tannier, head stock controller. Mr. Gruault, legal department. Mr. Laliers, purchasing. Our accounting trio: Ms. Pr?, chief clerk, Ms. Couturier & Ms. Chouster. There're three of you in accounting? Mr. Bonnet, receiving. I think you already know Mr. Dubin & Mrs. Malthus. Indeed. Mr. Doutre, head of advertising. - Louis Coline, his assistant. - We've met. We can go out on the floor through here, if you wish. Certainly not, Mr. Blain. I don't have to tell you that one sells better a product one doesn't know. Just ask in the army... It's nice of you, what's going on? - Nothing. I'm fired. - Not true. Well, no, but might as well. In short, a handshake stuck in your throat. Yeah. For me, it's a nightmare. Your hand. Your hand! What's more, its seems he put these two guys in charge. - In charge of what? - That's not clear. I'll take charge here. Go, straight. Slightly to the left. Attention, yellow light. Slow down red light Now, stop. Need to fix that. I won't always be there. Green That bad? Yep. I've been with the firm for two years, doing squat for two years. I'm paid to screw around, go to the caf?, talk to my buddies on the phone, pick lottery numbers, hassle Miss Pr?, just go figure.. Me who wanted to devour the whole world... ...with your little bird's appetite! Have you seen any billboards for the store? In the street, in stores, papers, in the metro: nothing! We've been goofing off over there. So, why would they keep the assistant to the head of a department that exists only by mistake? - Where's sugar? - Here. It's not complicated, if I had an ego... I would have quit long ago. Quit... We'll manage on my salary. No, it's too late. And when for once there's a guy who seems to want to get things done, I'd like to be there, you see? Go tell him that... Yeah, I'll go talk to him tomorrow. I'll go straight to his office tomorrow and lay out my cards. I've got suggestions to make, ideas for advertising campaigns, and everything... I won't be shy! Fran?ois Lingre. It's Bertrand who put us here. You are across the hall, with accounting. We're consolidating. Come see. I brought everything. Your papers, your radio, your wife, all your stuff... You can check. - You like it here, Mr. Doutre, don't you? It's not really me, it was Paul. With his drafts, his calculators, his files. He takes up an entire office! What does Paul do exactly? Now there, time will tell. Let's go get some coffee. Sure, go ahead. I've shoplifted all this in 20 minutes 37 seconds. No effort. No one around. It's not leakage. It's distribution. Who's responsible for the perfume department? Mrs. Dubuisson. Well, she gets the cake, Mrs. Dubuisson. Does she work for charity or what? - Yes? - Let me introduce myself. Paul Belais. Have we met? - There! - "Jabiru" is not a word. You'll see! Jabiru! "Substantive. Wading bird, inhabiting warm climates, related to the stork. - Up to 5ft tall." - Pass the dictionary. It makes... 8... 9... 16 48... 250 total. - 113. - I win! Whose turn is it? Serge, how much do I owe you? Let's have lunch one of these days. As you wish. Thought we were on first name basis. As you like, whenever. You know the neighborhood. What's a good place to eat? A good place... There's La Chope... The problem is it's expensive. That's not good. Otherwise, there's Le Relais. How about here? - It's ok. - Half past noon? - Today? - Should we make an appointment? No, just kidding. Have you talked to him about me? - About what? - Well, us, in advertising, we're not sure what we're doing. So, would be good to see him, talk it over... We've been sitting on our hands for two weeks now... Don't worry. He can see that. - Ah, I see... - See you later. Do we really have to eat here? - Drop it, ok? - You like this stuff? - No, I didn't say I do. - Well then! But he comes here all the time. - Could I take this chair? - No! Bertrand will stop by for a coffee. You're not in a hurry, are you? Leave him alone, he's got work to do. - Gotta jump on the opportunity! - Yep. You tell me! So, Mr. Coline, it seems I dislike you? I've never said that. Just that we don't see much of each other. That's true. Any good? Not particularly. You're right. This might hurt your feelings, Mr. Coline, but the advertising dept. needs a makeover. Doesn't it? You agree with me? I need your help! Lots of work ahead of us! Try finding a parking place in this neighborhood! - You've got company parking. - So that every knows when I come and go? No, thanks, Mr. Coline. I need thirty minutes of your time. Can't do. I'll be with Mr. Coline the whole afternoon, now that we have him here. Tomorrow morning, then? Has anyone ordered coffee? Not sure what you think about it, but it's better like this, the furniture... It used to be uninhabitable. I call you Louis because it's less dreadful than Coline. In your opinion, what is advertising for? To make sales. Well, I'll explain it to you differently. For me, the Magasins have taken a wrong turn. Sales figures aren't bad, I know... Nobody goes of their way around here. I've given myself a year to raise the standards. We must be first. The first. Else, what's the use. You think of superstores? You must know, Louis, I won't be fucked over by dinosaurs. But we also have the advantages: great location... diversified product... and our sales reps, they're top-notch, you know? They're at the battle front. If they lose it, we all go under. Fran?ois Lingre has brought to my attention a bit of merchandise leakage they were having. Paul will take care of it. As for us, our work is very simple, Louis. Three stages: spring sales, white sales, Christmas. This, and nothing else, makes our bottom line. And this, Louis, is where you come in. I'm all ears. You don't think that Mr. Doutre should present at our conversation? I must tell you a bit about myself, Coline. One of my first jobs, let's say a bank... I didn't beat around the bush. I sorted, picked, fired... It was the time of American efficiency. The good ones on one side, the others out. And one day, one of the others, 15 years of seniority, sick wife, too many kids, rebelled. He committed suicide. As for Doutre, you keep him in the loop, it's up to you, not my problem. His higher rank, as far as we're concerned, will consist solely in the wage difference. Which means, Louis, total availability, and reassessment of everything and everyone. And above all of ideas. Ideas, ideas, ideas. Ah, Louis, you didn't call this morning... - No. - I was afraid to miss your call. I had Yoyotte do groceries, she almost fell. As it happens, today, - I wanted to tell you the news. - What news? A call from Georges, a tour, I'm leaving for 3 months. It's as good as done. Right! It'll be like four years ago. At best, you'll get as far Forges-les-Eaux! And for whom did I come back? Forgive me! I haven't called you! But, for a change, you were dying! Don't listen to what she's saying. One doesn't need anyone to die. What's the occasion? Don't tell me your wife is pregnant. No. Don't worry. Your grandson is VERY careful. - You talked to him? - Yes. - And? - Well! Bertrand didn't even want to see Doutre. - Bertrand? - Yes, Malair, whatever. More shampoo. It's disgusting. He's a great guy. He's the sort of person you need to know how to manage. And I figured out how: work and efficiency! Someone with whom you definitely need pay up front. Did you tell him about your idea for a stamp? No. He's got bigger plans than that. Close your eyes. I'm rinsing. Wait a sec. Anyway, it's a hell of a trio: Paul the manager, Fran?ois: security and time buying, shrewd as a fox... and Malair: the brain, the one to asses, decide, see the big picture... The pillar. Wait. Let's dry it off. And what would I do without you? You'd have dirty hair. All bus stops in the 15th, 17th, 18th and 19th! Not to mention metro lines no. 9, 12 & 15... Plus the RER train... all the way across. And in the neighborhood, nothing? No, we've got all the buses for eight days, plus the press, that is, all dailies, - and Saturday mags. - Well, I see. And how much all this is going to cost? Mr. Doutre, the important thing is not how much it will cost but how much revenue it will bring. Louis! - Yes? - Could you come for a minute? Yes, sir. - I'm gonna go. - Go ahead... You still smoke Gitanes? Can I have one? These two imbeciles have decided to quit. Together. It's strong, huh? - Everything's ok? - Yes. You still agree with what we said the other time? Yes. To all appearance, you and me, we speak the same language. Have the same goals? So, what's wrong? Is Doutre in the way? No, he's not in the way. I think he'd just like to be more involved, that's all. But he is involved. He's the head of advertising. Yes, but for us, it is Louis who is responsible. That is why I'm asking: what's wrong? I see that bus stop negotiations are scheduled for the 15th. Why the 15th? That's because I want to handle this personally, and I won't be around from 7 to 14. - So I scheduled it for the 15th. - What do you mean not around? Well, I'm taking my winter break. I've got one week in winter, three in summer... And what do you do on Ramadan? Let's be serious. We'll move the meeting to the 8th, this way you'll have full 6 days for the metro, the press, and the highways. Believe me, it's not going to be too much. This way we'll have four weeks in the summer. And we can always go to London. It's not far. Anyway, I'm the one who suffers the most here: I was hoping to get a cashmere sweater. Then again, you could go without me, with Sophie... - OK. You're so keen on going to London? No. But this way, I can get you your cashmere sweater. I'm a pain in the neck, am I not? Of course not. Let's make love. To have a head start. How much did we say? Five grand... Each. That makes 10 grand. Here goes our work. I told you guys. Every route, everywhere, that's that, 10 grand, done! Good move! "I'm off, off to the Magasins." That's totally dumb! It's dumb, you're right. He's taking the bus now? He called me this morning not to pick him up. Conclusion: he wasn't home. That's funny. Never thought he'd do something like this. Does he have kids? - Half past noon? - At Le Relais? OK, it's my treat. There are those who laugh, but there are also those who cry. - Why are you saying that? - For no reason. Only I don't think Miss Dubuisson and Miss Pr? feel much like laughing this morning. That's all. - And why wouldn't they? - Fired. Miss Dubuisson with much fuss & at a loss: without severance pay. And Miss Pr?, got all the honors, I admit, but still... ... fired. Don't let it stop you from laughing with your friends. "...having failed to meet the deadline, - our establishment is entitled to..." - Where's Fran?ois? Where he usually is. "Having failed to meet the deadline, our establishment..." It's women's hour. Anything can happen. Tell me, is it true that Malair fired Pr? and Dubuisson? He did, and so what? Dubuisson, I can understand, up to a point, but why Pr?? She drank, didn't she? You think it's fair that Paul gets stuck with all the work while she's in a bar? Do you think that all this runs on white wine? For one Pr?, one Dubuisson, who leave, there are 315 others, ready to stay and work in safety. So, would you prefer we keep Pr? and Dubuisson, at the risk of kicking them all out into the street? Plus, have you thought about the girl who'll take Dubuisson's place? She's very happy... Say, will come to yell at me if I suggest you replace Doutre? 6, 7, 14. You're right, my friend, we live only once. What did you pick? No. 10, Sleeping beauty. You speak English now? Is it because Nina is over there? But he's going to win. You might be right, I better cover myself. You're right, it's chilly out. May I? Sure, what brings you here? I've been looking for you. It's done, placed a bet on your sleeping beauty. You're the guy who works with him? One could say that. Unless it's him working with me. - Unless... - Give you a call, about lunch? - Yeah. - OK, bye. Bye, Etienne. A good buddy of yours? A bit dumb, isn't he? - No, not really. - To bet on horses, one must be dumb. But we, we don't gamble, it's just for fun. Ready to go? - Where? - Bertrand is waiting for us. Beautiful, isn't it? Empty streets on a Sunday morning. What I'd like to know is where they are. During the week, when they should be working, they're in the street, and Sunday... when they should be taking a walk, there's no one. That doesn't surprise you? This kind of a problem? Paul, we're here. Fran?ois, fetch the Villeret files. And tell the legal adviser to get Lacroix's conclusions. I won't be telling you, Louis, what to do. See you later. Can you come over? Bertrand wants your opinion. - What do you think, Louis? - To go out? No, why? - I think it's a bit shiny. - What did I say? Here, this is your style. One thinks to be free of restrictions, to be a prisoner of one's own style. What's your style, Louis? I've never really made up my mind. That's what I call freedom. Give me the suit. He's on the 3rd floor. 600 sq meters. - What's his place like? - Huge. Well, I'm gonna get going. How's that? I'm playing poker with some buddies. Well, you'll just have to cancel. We're going to Max's. - What's Max? - You'll see. Salom? will be there. - It's late! - Good evening! Hang it for me, would you? But on a hanger, otherwise it... What's up? Louis Coline, the head of advertising. Ms. Viellarguance... Dr. Martin Lassale, aka Jean-Loup. Our friend, the president - Nice to meet you. - And Mrs. Paul Belais. - Everyone's here. - Good evening. - Have you been introduced to Salom?? - No. How's the menu? Rosette de Lyon sausage with vegetables. Rabbit in mustard, or a brill filet with sorrel. What do you say, Louis? - Sounds good. - Rabbit. I'll take the filet, and let you try a bite. Rabbit. Brill. - Fish? - No, rabbit. Rabbit or brill? - And you, brill? - Yes. So, 4 times brill, 4 times rabbit, four times sausage, and 4 salads. If I'm not mistaken, the waters Finally swallowed up fisher and boat; And with her singing The Lorelei did this. And with her singing The Lorelei did this. In any case, our Salom? won't be one to disagree. Andr? Gide's translation doesn't sound bad, either. But, in Gide, Lorelei is a boy! Salom? is a boy. Oh, not quite. Thank God, she doesn't have tits or a big butt She has angelic breasts. There's nothing more touching. Would you show him? You're right, it's still early. We'll all androgynous, it's just a question of degree. Speak for yourself. It's half past midnight, and we haven't said a word about the Magasins. It's wonderful! - Right? What? - Nothing. Only Louis is getting bored. - No, not at all. - Louis, come on, Louis. We've had a great meal, we're together, that's friendship! What is friendship? Being able to say openly what one thinks. - Right? - Yes. - We agree? Well done. Your inseparable four-colored pen? As always. Black for official correspondence. Blue for personal letters, and red for corrections. And green? Would you like to have it? I'm giving it to you. You'll lend it to me when you like, and you'll write what you want in green. What are you up to now? - Are you heading home? - Yes. Hop in. - Goodbye, president! - Goodbye, dear friends. And thank you! It's Salom?. How are you? Fine. I'll put Jean-Loup. Bertrand would like to know if you got home OK. Yes... Thanks. Goodbye then. Goodbye. - Well? - Right! - Rhinocluxine, ever heard of it? - It's nothing... - It's a cold. Rather, nasal inflammation. Rhinocluxine, indispensable. Pull over here. I'll be fine. It says 4 inhalations up to 4 times a day, but you can take up to 8. More, 8 times. - Clears you up, doesn't it? - Yes, it's working. May, June, July are taken care of, all that's left is the tax payment for September. That's a great idea, Louis! You can sell anything by showing a woman's ass... "You see the ill in others which you know in yourself." - Exactly! - And one p?t?. Oh, shit, you asked for ham? - They must take the ball from him. - From whom? Sulzer, watch closely. - Stopirin isn't playing? - No, he's got tendonitis. 3 weeks off. Take good notes. I got the floors mixed up. How's it going? Not a good time? I didn't see you. Hello. - Hi. I get it you're also into soccer? I think there's Horowitz on channel 3, huh? Ah, it must be over. What are you drinking? - Beer? - I'd like scotch. How many rooms do you have? This one, the other, 60 sq meters in all. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - That must include the balcony? - You want some ice? - Oh, no, ice! Say, where's your phone? Don't move. - Hey, your friend's a bit of a drag. - Fran?ois? Ah, no, he's alright, he's funny. Bertrand, it's me. At Louis's. No, 15 min. I met Marcel, it's all set. No, not too much, really. OK, see you in a bit. Good thing I had the cord, I would have got lost. It's crazy. Since he came, nothing's in its place, nothing filed... I'm having hard time finding myself. Wait, I'll put everything in order in 10 minutes There you go! - Can you come over for 10 min? - But only 10, I must go to the airport. - Going somewhere? - No, but Nina's coming back from London. - So soon? - Well, yeah! - Coming? If you start adding tax again, I'll deduct it from your pay. Louis! We can't find your estimates for the fall quarter. Well, I put them here myself. - How's your cold, better? - It's over. - Here it is. - Well, what are you talking about, here it is. Well, kids, we'll be only four of us tonight. - Three. I'll be gone in 2 min. - What do you mean gone? Gone. My wife must be already waiting downstairs. We're dining at my in-laws, in Versailles. After all, it's not rocket science. Just add the totals - & offset if that doesn't work! - Don't worry, Louis will type it up and I'll dictate. Run along! I can't stay, either. My wife is flying in tonight. Bye now! I'll look it over early tomorrow. I can't stay tonight, Bertrand. Right. The more we talk the longer we work. Wait, I'm coming. It's too small. Not it's not too small. Exactly what I wanted. I like it when they're short like this. It's great. I'm really sorry. Really? You were working? - Like a dog. - In any case, it agrees with you. You look well. You know there's someone who can't wait to meet you. - Who's that? - Malair. - Really? Can we kiss now? We can, we can. We will. I must warn you, I put on some weight. - I'm going to be late. - Wait 2 more minutes! He's always on time. There he comes! 8:15, as usual. So, let me explain: Paul gets out first... And then Bertrand. Bertrand is the one in a loden coat. Are you sure he's not there? Sinister. Well, he doesn't like it, either. It's for the customers... So what does he like? Open the door some more! I can barely hear you. Why didn't you come to eat with us? That's over, my dear Louis, I'm too weak at night. Look who's complaining, huh? - In short, you're his right hand. - One of his right hands. He's got several, like Buddha. Well, if I'm not the head of a dept by the end of the year, they'll cut one off. You better believe it. The store is running on a different track now. - What is he like? Cheerful, nice? - Abstract. Omnipresent. Like God. Look! Scheduler, calendar, alarm, time zones. Quartz. - Does it tell time? - That too. - It must have cost a fortune. - Not a cent. It's a gift. We were passing by a watch shop with Bertrand, he asked me which one I liked best... I said, 'this one', just like that. He went in and bought it for me. That's nice. I hope you said Thank you. How about this one? It's more like lunch. A bit countryside, don't you think? Oh, well. He'll see me the way I am. In jeans and a T-shirt. If he doesn't like it, too bad. I'm really very happy to have met you. Because Louis talks about you all the time. "I must tell Nina," "Nina likes this," "Nina does that"... "I must head back, so as not to upset Nina...." You're lucky. - Right, Louis? - Yep... However, he never told me what you do. But perhaps you don't do anything? I'm a head consultant at the Manufacture de Sevres. That can't be! That's fascinating! - Why have you never told me? - What do they do there? - Jigsaw puzzles with broken porcelain? - You imbecile! Porcelain is a whole other world! And it's dying because it lacks ostentation, right? It's a possible definition, but rather superficial, right? - What's your period? - A wide range, but mostly... - 17th century? - Yes. One day, we can find some time to talk about it. - Ah, Louis, have you heard the news? - No. - Doutre is leaving. 45 min in my office, he wasn't interested... Doutre was... discretion itself. Reliability. Like those walls one takes for granted. When one falls, the house falls. One didn't realize it was the supporting wall. What about children? You don't want any? We do. Some day, perhaps. - How old are you? - 29. You should have children. Afterwards, anything is possible... What does he want? What is he looking for? Bertrand? He's doing his job. Why? I don't like him. - What did the doctor say? - That she's old. - When did it happen? - In the morning. I tried to call you, but they said you were in a meeting. You should go to sleep. You're both working tomorrow. I'll be there. If there's anything, just call me. You hear, call us, mom, we're there. Louis, I've signed the tour contract. Listen, it's not the first time, she'll get better. It is the first time. - Can you brush my teeth? I'm beat. - You're kidding... Go ahead. It's late. What's going on? My apartment is being redone... I need to ask you a small favor. I'd like to... stay with you for a while, because my place is unlivable, and hotels, you never feel at home... He'll be back. - Where can I... - Hold on... You'll say I could have gone to Fran?ois's, but it's worse than a studio. Sort of a hole in the wall that used to belong to his mother. One could have some deep thoughts in there. Good evening. How are you? Louis was kind enough to extend his hospitality for a night or two. Here? - But where? - It's just to help me out. Louis will tell you. We'll figure it out. He'll get the bedroom, and we'll sleep on the couch. Good idea. It's great to be young. - If there's any problem, I'll go. - It'll be fine. Go to her. Are you crazy or what? I couldn't say no. It's just one night, not a big deal. - He gets on my nerves. - You don't realize... It's a sign of his confidence in me. One night. OK. Over here! I took the liberty. A bit hungry. Fran?ois isn't back yet? No. I borrowed your keys. Where do I put Bertrand?s things? In the bedroom. I'll get fresh sheets. Oh, don't bother. It's nice like this. - Is the other one staying over, too? - Yes, they've got to work. - You think they're in their pajamas? - Stop it... - What are you doing? - You don't mind they're there, do you? - Are you crazy? - I'll make you scream. No, stop... Thanks for everything, Louis. It might be best if you don't mention this to your co-workers. It wouldn't be good. 8 o'clock at the cafe, as usually. Your friend, Bertrand. - Did you see what they gave me? - No. What you gave me? Come see. - Wow, a fishing pole! - It's great. It's a funny idea, I never caught a fish in my life. They're being really subtle. This comes from Galleries Lafayette stores, not here. Isn't it great to find at new job at 50. I hope you still get your seniority. I wouldn't have accepted otherwise, you can be sure. So, there you go, Louis. This chair is yours now. Not for too long. Since... you know what they say about advertising... - What do they say? - Well, I'm not worried about you. You'll climb higher. Look, your glass is empty. Oh, tell me... Is it true that Malair is staying at your place? Temporarily. One must help one's employer. How else would we cope? Ah, the party is almost finished. Imbecile, couldn't you have told me? Mr. Doutre! I won't let you leave like that! You'll dine with us. Everyone, we're going to Robin's. - It's shocking. - Sordid. - You think? People are sleeping. Good evening. I'm very thirsty! - Everything OK? - No. What's that? I'd like to speak with Louis. Of course. What's wrong? I wanted to talk to you before kicking him out. - What do you mean? - Get them out. Both of them. - Now? - Now. - You know what time it is? I know what time it is. I've been waiting for 3 hours to be able to go to bed. Go. Be nice. Tell them yourself. I want to sleep in my own bed. Well, I'm going. Don't worry, you won't be to blame. You're not going like this? You want to screw everything up, or what? What "everything"? Your position? Is that what you mean? And they, aren't they screwing us up? - That's not the problem. - What is the problem? Stop it, stop it. Stop it! I won't say anything. May I get dressed? I'm going to Sophie's. Did she leave? This, this, and this. And make it quick. - Am I interrupting? - No. How is your wife? Fine. How long has it been since you saw her? Five days. If it were me, I'd go get her right away. Are they still at your place? - No. - Well, then? Well, then... I don't know. I've got work. I don't know. It's Louis. No, I took 10 days off. I'm sun bathing. How are you? Good job. Did you get the keys back? Good. I don't know yet. We'll see. Bye. Take care of yourself. So, who's going to take care of my plants? You're right. I'm going back. - Damn. And we're selling this? - Yes, and even very well. - No returns? - Plenty. You surprise me. I got his cold. I'm sick of this place. OK, kids, get the files together for me. We must get it done tonight. We'll go my place. Come on, let's go. - You've never been to Bertrand's? - No. - You'll see, it's something else. Set it down over here. Aren't you afraid of the dark? You can put the table where you want. - Where are the cookies? - In the kitchen. I'll go see. Make yourself comfortable. What do we do now? We'll find a place to sleep. It's not a big deal. You'll take my bed, I'll sleep in the deck chair. It's not the first time. Sometimes... he brings so many people, I don't know where to put them up. What about Bertrand? I thought we came here to work. Not to worry. If he needs us, he'll wake us up. Good night. You lost or won? I didn't play. I worked all night. At the Magasins? No, at Bertrand's. So now it's at his place? Just this one time, because we had a problem to solve. - Did you solve it? - Yes. I'm glad. We could just move in with your friends. Soon it's back to school, then Christmas... January sales, 4-day sale in March. We won't get bored. You're joking? You frighten me. I love you. I don't think so. Is this enough, or do you need more detail? - That will do. - We're going to Max's. Not me! I'm going home. - And what do I tell Bertrand? - Tell him I can't. If he can't, he can't. - He'll be disappointed. - Oh, well. Is that your doing? You frighten me, Louis. You've changed. The way you make love and are with me, have changed, too. I've no idea what these people are to you, but I tip my hat to them, because they've won. Don't start loving me again, because I'm gone. I'm done loving you, I wish you no harm. I'm going to stay with my father in Saint-Cloud. Don't come to see me, don't call, If you write me, I won't open your letters. I'm not leaving you for anyone, but because you're no one. My hugs. Nina. Come in. We're in the kitchen. We found a box of ravioli. You didn't go to dinner at Max's? We didn't. Ah, Louis. How nice. Have a seat. - Have you eaten? - I'm not hungry. One must eat. Reheat some ravioli for him. First you'll have something to eat. Barton & Questier, 1968. To Louis's health! Nine has left me. Slept well? So, Salom? was here last night, wasn't she? You know, Salom?, she comes and goes. Over here! Sit down. - Would you like to take a bath? - No, I'll stop by at my place. You think it's a good idea? Fran?ois will go with you. He's quite fond of you, you know? - You do or not? - I know. You see, what's happening to you, Louis, is totally banal. A man who climbs... and a woman who struggles behind... They don't like heights. I'm not judgmental. That's how it is. I don't know. You didn't tell me about your father. I thought he was dead. But it turns out he's alive, in Canada. - Who told you that? - Who cares? What matters is that you didn't tell me. It's very important, Louis, the image of one's father. It explains everything. Or nothing. And even if it explains nothing, it explains everything. You see him often? - No. - Louis! I won't lie to you. It was Nina who told me. Nina? You saw her? 5 minutes. By chance. We had a coffee. I find this in my mailbox. I open, I look at it, and here's what I do. Next time it has to be legible! Double the title font size, and leave some room for photos. - Are you coming? We'll be late. - Coming. The photos are ready, might as well use them. It's a profession. They wanted to skin me, I made them double their stakes. We'll put the Christmas bonus together. The administration is on my side. Isn't it normal, our performance has been good? Louis, sales aren't enough, you must also have revenues. Take your time! - Good thing I've waited! - Robert! Have you been waiting long? I just came to get some things. - Going anywhere? - No. Eight days. Duration of holidays at the Magasins. All's well at work? We'll double our sales by Christmas. You must think Nina has sent me. - I do. - She doesn't know about my visit. I should be happy to have my daughter home... But I'm not happy. I don't think she's happy. She hasn't said anything, but since she stopped telling me anything... It was she who left. I know. However, she did talk about your friends. They've been great for me. I was lucky to have them. Of course, of course. I remember, I once had friends We argued with Mathilde, but then we figured it out. It's not a good reason. Why have you come, Robert? To understand. Or... to try. - You're not alone? - Robert, Nina's father. Fran?ois Lingre. Pleasure. Hey, Bertrand's waiting. I'm coming. It's good. This is good, but you could aim higher. We've got the means. Don't be shy. Tell Paul we won't be there today. We'll settle this straight away, and save two weeks. Get the door, it's Fran?ois. I met with the staff representative, these people get up too early! - We'll have to give in a bit, huh? - We will. Paul? It's Louis. We won't be coming in today. OK? Take care. - I stopped by your place and brought your mail. - Great. Anything's wrong, Louis? My grandmother. - Is she in her room? - No, we took her to the hospital yesterday. She was asking for you. I tried to reach you in your office. And at night at home, no one was able to tell me... So I wrote you a note. The funeral is tomorrow. Filo stayed by her side, and wouldn't move. Ren? is here. - Luckily, she has her tour. - Didn't she cancel? - No, another one. September, October, November, better paid, three scenes. - That's good. - I understand. - Where's Louis? - He's there. - Do you need a ride? - I'm going to the cemetery. Right, of course. They came, look, that's nice of them. Did you stop by to pick up my mail? No, I don't have the keys any more, gave them to Jean-Loup. It's for one of his girlfriends, 3-4 days, I didn't want to get into it. He found himself a Polish girl. What I'd like to know is how does he jump that fat cow's bones. Louis, let's go. Not too heavy? Louis could have come. Here, a window seat. You'll be nice and cozy. - Need a hand? - No, I'll manage. Tell Louis not to work too hard. - And to come pick me up. - Don't worry, if he's not there, I will be. Kids, you're real angels, but I'm going to be late. It's still a bit damp. Spotless. The president is getting on my nerves with his gala dinners. - Who's driving me? - Me. Roll the dice. 7. No way! That was a jammy shot! It's been three nights that I've been sleeping there. Thank you, my dice! Good night. I was 8 or 9 years old. We were in the country, I had managed to convince myself that my father wasn't my father. All of a sudden, he became more interesting. I followed him everywhere, I was spellbound. My mother bored me. She was either too happy, too sad, or too fat. Too... something, anyway. Then, some time had passed. My father grew older, and so did I. Every year I resembled him a little more. It really was my father. He's asleep. The innocent sleep. He never wanted to know anything. Fran?ois can be comfortable only with his pockets empty. Do you want me to tell you? I envy you not having had a father. Just like baby Jesus. I didn't take a deep breath until after he'd died. He wanted to be buried in the village. I had him cremated. I wonder which one among the three of you: Paul, Fran?ois, or you will be the first to burn me at the stake. Good night, Louis. He put his father in a retirement home in Nice, and he's doing very well, thank you. You're in good spirits! You've never been good at psychology. Why? - You want the bad news before or after coffee? - Before. - He's gone. - What? He's gone. Bertrand is gone. - What do you mean gone? - Gone, vanished. He left a note. Should I read it? "Louis, Fran?ois, "you were asleep so hard I didn't want to wake you. "And in fact, I had little to tell you. "I'm going. Elsewhere. A new project, "A new adventure which you cannot share. "You were my two arms, my two hands... "I won't be able to replace you. Yours. Bertrand." - Is that it? - It's nice that he wrote at all. Isn't it him, second row? No, here. He's not even in the photo. He's not even in the photo! Fuck, shit! No, I didn't know. I found out this morning, like everyone else, - when I got your memo. - The board meeting's on Friday, aren't you representing us, Paul? - Is it true he's in New York, Malair? - Canberra. - Where's Canberra? - Australia. Why, planning on going? You'll laugh, but I was seriously considering going to Canberra. Paul made me change my mind. After all, Malair could be just as well in Stockholm, Borneo, or, why not?, Paris. God knows where. Shortly afterwards, Fran?ois disappeared in turn. Paul found it funny. You must think: he imagined him chasing Malair around the world. At night, sometimes, I'd hang around Eylau Avenue. For nothing. I would look into the windows that never lit up. I was never sure whether I was sad, angry, or just lonely. But I never dared to enter. Deep in my heart, I was afraid of running into him. Time had passed. Be reassured: Paul was right. My contract was renewed, so, financially, I'm OK. I don't know why, but something tells me Bertrand will be back. I must be there, you understand? In the end, we got along well, him and me.
