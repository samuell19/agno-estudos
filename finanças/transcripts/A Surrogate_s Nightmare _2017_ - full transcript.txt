Hi Shelly. This better be important. I’m at 136, I gotta maintain it for 20 more minutes. I found your little present. I saw it at the mall, I couldn’t resist. Only the best is good enough for my grandchild. I love you, mom. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I’m not even pregnant yet. You will be. And it’s a grandma’s prerogative to think ahead. Now, what are you having for breakfast? No coffee. Don’t worry, I’ve got your list. That’s my girl. Ok, I must be off. I’ll see you at home in an hour. No! No! Please! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! Please, I’m sorry! I’m so glad you’re here. Come here. Hi. I know it’s unfinished but I wanted to hang it anyway. She was such a good painter. I’m surprised she didn’t do more with it, you know? She always said going pro would take the fun out of it. You should take some paintings back with you. Oh... When you go to New York. Yeah. I can’t imagine how hard this is for you. I... you didn’t get to spend as much time with mom as I did. I know. But you know what? I can grieve and be here for my baby sister at the same time. How long can you stay? I will stay here as long as you need me. Hey. Hey. Did you see her? Yes, I did. For what it’s worth she finally looked at peace. You know, um... a detective asked me a bunch of questions about mom’s routine, her day-to-day stuff. The police are investigating? I don’t know... I- I mean, they say it was just routine. They’re ruling it an accident. I can’t think of anyone who would want to hurt mom. Can you? Hey guys. Hey. Hey, sweetheart, I hate to do this but Larry’s calling an emergency brainstorming session so I gotta run to the office. Just for a bit, ok? I love you. I love you, too. Shelly, did mom and David get along? No. They kept fighting about the baby. Baby? Are you pregnant? No. This was mom’s wishful thinking. She’s been buying this stuff for months. Angela, I let mom die thinking that she was gonna be a grandma. But the truth is, I can’t have a baby. Oh, honey. I’m sorry. It’s all I ever wanted. I know it’s so old fashioned- It’s not old fashioned. It’s not at all. It’s beautiful. Yeah. It’s not possible for me. I believe anything’s possible. If you want it badly enough. There are so many options- Expensive options. David and I already looked into surrogacy and adoption and... those things are beyond us right now. But David’s up for a promotion, so maybe someday. Someday soon. As Romans 12:18 teaches us: "If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, "live at peace with everyone." Joan is at peace now. It’s the mission of those surviving her to find their own peace. Joan was a doting mother to Shelly and to Angela. Joan lived for her loved ones and I believe it would be her wish for those loved ones to find peace and contentment in her memory. It’s ok. Reverend? Angela. We spoke on the phone. Hi. Thank you. You did her proud. Thank you. I was so surprised to get your call. I’ve known your mother for over a decade and didn’t know she had an older daughter. That does not surprise me. I was the black sheep of the family. Well, I’m so glad you could make it. I’m sorry, what? I was saying I was so glad you could be here. For Shelly. Me too. Excuse me. Shelly? Hey. Hey. I keep thinking she’s gonna walk through that door. I miss her. It just doesn’t feel real. I’ve been thinking. You’re my sister and I love you and I think it would be a tragedy if someone with as much love to give as you have didn’t get to be a mother. So I would be honored if you and David would let me carry your baby for you. Angela, we could never ask you to do that- You didn’t ask me. I’m offering. Let me be your surrogate. Really? Really. Hey. Hey. Thanks for meeting me on your lunch. Yeah, of course. I forgot how beautiful it is here. I’ve been avoiding places like this ever since we found out I can’t have a baby. But today it’s different. Today I love seeing these kids. David, we could have a baby now instead of waiting. How? A surrogate. Sweetheart, we’ve talked about that. We can’t afford it. It’s not gonna cost us anything. Angela offered to carry our baby. Uh... is that what you want? It’s all I’ve ever wanted. Until we found out about my infertility, I never imagined myself not being a mother. Now I can be. David, it’s a miracle. The implantation worked on the first try. We’re gonna have a baby. Wow, ok, but Shel, it’s still really, really early alright? So let’s be... cautiously optimistic. I’m optimistically cautious. I just wish mom was here. This would have made her so happy. You don’t think we rushed into this, do you? What? Of course not, do you? Uh... no. No, honey. I’m sorry. I don’t. I just... ugh. Larry is on my back about this Asian expansion thing and I think I’m just a little distracted, that’s all. But I’m super excited. I promise, I am. Um, I’m just gonna finish up this last email and then we can go? Ok. Alright. I spent hours looking through this jewelry box as a kid. Oh, that was strictly off limits for me. Oh, remember when you sent me this? Oh my god! You still have this? I sent you this when you were, like, 12 years old. Oh, this makes me think of that blue dress mom would wear with the fringe that made her look like a showgirl? Mom never told me why you and her didn’t get along. I’d ask but she never wanted to talk about it. It was complicated. Our relationship. It was um... well, I was a rebellious teenager, for one. And she was really strict so that didn’t blend well. I... I wanted to get out of this town. I wanted more. You know what matters to me? That you had a happy childhood worth remembering. You did, right? Yeah. I did. I’m just sorry it wasn’t that way for you. I really loved mom. I’m glad. Shelly, when I was 17, before I left to go to New York, I- Hello? I’m coming down. Hey. Hey. So I have some good news. Oh. A colleague at work recommended this realtor and apparently he is amazing. Are you guys selling the house? David, I don’t think I’m ready to sell yet. We grew up in this house. Yeah. And I still feel mom here. And with the baby coming... Yeah, I get that Shel, but also a house is... is just a thing. I feel like we could really use a fresh start. I think it would be really good for us. We can get away from all this gloom. You’re moving way too fast, ok? Our mother just died and now you want to put our house on the market? Shelly, I don’t think this is the time to be making major decisions like selling our childhood home. You didn’t stick around here once you had the chance to leave, did you? I was 17, It’s hardly the same thing. Excuse me, I need some fresh air. Cute little guy. Yeah, I uh... I got him for Shelly. I thought it might cheer her up. Yeah. Hey David, I think it would be a mistake for Shelly to sell our house. I think she would regret that. I know I would. That’s surprising considering that you haven’t been back here. Well, I’m back now. And I’m gonna be here for the next nine months at least. I’m actually gonna write my next book about this little town where I grew up. Lotta of legends, lotta of secrets. Hmm. Well, I’m sure it’ll be a real page-turner. I hope so. I’m going for a run. Enjoy. Hi, I called earlier. Hi! Hi. I know who you are. Oh! Uh, when I uh, spoke to you this morning you said that your next book might be about our little town, well, I took the liberty of compiling some sources. Oh, thank you. I’m Nicole, by the way. You’re very sweet. Thank you for this. No problem. Alright, I’m just gonna go... Please. Ok. Ok. Let me know if you need anything else. Ok. Ok. Curt. Angela, hi. I thought I saw you and then you were gone and now you’re... hey. "The Strange Case of Cordelia Webb." Have you read it? Uh, no. No, not yet, but to be honest I was thinking we might run into each other so I thought I’d read it in case you asked. I thought I saw you at my mom’s funeral. Yeah, I was there. Why didn’t you say anything? I’m sorry, it- just didn’t feel like the right time. Your mom’s funeral and all. Right. I really just wanted to make sure, you know, you were doing ok. I lost my own mother a few years back so I know how hard it is. I’m so sorry. And then I saw you outside your mom’s place but I was working so, you know, never enough hours in a day. You know, I... I meant to call you so many times over the years to... talk and try to explain why things happened the way they did and I just... I’m sorry. I don’t even know what I’m trying to tell you. I just- Don’t. Please, don’t. It’s in the past. It’s not necessary. Hey, you know what? Uh, why don’t we use some of the time we don’t have and grab a coffee? Sure. That sounds like time I don’t have well spent. This place is amazing to me. This area has just changed so much. It’s very chic. I’m glad you like it. You look good, Curt. You do. You look really good. And it makes me happy. You doing ok? Yeah, yeah. It wasn’t easy at first. For a long time no one would hire me. But um... I started my own business and now things are good. But what about you? Tell me what’s going on. I haven’t seen you in forever. Oh, well before I was rushed back here after mom died... After your mom died? I thought I saw you a couple days before that. On the street. Before? Me? Yeah. No. Maybe it was just someone who looked like me. Probably just wishful thinking on my part then. You know what’s crazy? I- I thought coming back here I would hate it and uh... I’m actually kind of inspired in a weird way and I think I may have the idea for my next book so I talked to Shelly, my sister, and um... I’m gonna stay a while. Not forever, I’m not done traveling the world, meeting interesting people, but I’m gonna stay put for a while. Fantastic. And I’m jealous about the traveling the world thing. Any... any favorite spots? Come on, tell me, please. I have a lot. I guess uh, Piazza del Duomo in Florence. You know it? Have you been? No, no, but I’ve read everything there is to know about it. It’s amazing. I’ve had a lot of time to read so I, uh... oh, I would love to go there but I unfortunately don’t think international travel is ever gonna be in my cards now. You know what, um... it’s not Florence, but there is a new Italian restaurant in town and uh, I’d really like to take you. I’d really like to go. Shelly! It’s me, I’m at the restaurant. The hostess says she’s got a great table for us so uh, I hope you’re just running late. Ok, first thing’s first. Mom, I’ve gone over the charts, everything is looking great. I was born premature. I really don’t want that for this baby. Ok, I- I get that, but we’re not there yet. And we have much better methods for controlling pre-term labor now than when you were born. Yeah, I gotta say for both you guys one of the highest risk factors to a healthy, full-term pregnancy is stress. You have one job; keep those stress levels down, ok? You know I will do whatever it takes! I don’t know. I’ll figure it out. Yeah, I’ll see you later. Who was that? Morning. Uh, just work stuff. I have to get going. We have a doctor’s appointment at 3:00 today. I thought you were gonna try and come and see the baby. I promise I’ll try my best. What time will you be home? Sweetheart, I don’t know. But hey, if I’m home in time maybe we order from that Thai place, yeah? Sure. Curt? Hi. Hey. Hi. You need an electrician? Oh, you’re mad. Just a little bit. I am sorry I wasn’t there last night. I’m not that kind of person. There was a family emergency, I got all caught up in it, I’ve been trying to call you all morning, you didn’t answer so I- I came all the way down here to say I’m sorry. It’s ok. I appreciate it. I- my phone’s been in the office all day. I forgot it this morning. I wasn’t ignoring your calls, I promise. You know, I- I meant what I said about knowing what it’s like to lose a parent. There’s no pressure here. Look, my mom and I weren’t that close anymore. It’s not about that. I just... there’s something I would like to talk to you about and I was hoping we could have a do-over at the Italian restaurant. Um, I promise I will be there. Alright, alright, alright, yes. Yes? Yes, I would love that. Thank you. Thank you. Hey David. Angela and the baby are both fine. I wish you were here. I hope everything’s ok. I thought you said you were gonna try and make it. Hey. Hey. What’s wrong? Am I that obvious? Yeah. Angela, David’s been acting weird. The last few weeks he’s been acting really different. Like he’s hiding something. He’s putting in so many hours at the office and... even when he’s home it’s like he’s not really there. I think I just really wanted him here today. To see the baby. I know you did. I wish you were here. I hope everything’s ok. I thought you said you were gonna try and make it. So, you haven’t told your wife yet? I will, Nora. Soon. Well, the longer you wait to tell her the angrier she’ll be when you finally do. Yeah. Don’t think I don’t know that. Hey, I’m just heading out for a quick dinner. Who’s the lucky guy? What do you mean? Hmm? What do you mean? You look hot. I don’t think you dress like that for a solo dinner. Oh... I don’t feel hot. I feel very pregnant and everything feels tight here and here. I’m just- I... it’s an old friend. Nothing. Ok. Um, I gotta go. I gotta go. Ok. Have fun. Thank you. Hey. Hey. Wow, you look amazing. Aw, thank you. I wanted to ring the doorbell like old times, but- Nah, I thought I’d save you the trip down memory lane. You know. Your last few visits here didn’t end well. Well, nothing like the nine years that followed it, believe me. Right. Do you know, I’m starving. I’ve been dreaming about pasta all day. Please let me feed you. Ok. Who are you spying on? Angela leaving for dinner with a guy she says is an old friend. Hmm. You know, David. She’ll be gone for at least an hour. And since we don’t have to schedule each other on a fertility calendar anymore we can just enjoy each other. Uh... as much as I would love that it’s almost 11:00 am in Beijing. I have a conference call that starts in ten minutes. Then I have to run back to the office just for a bit. But can I take a rain check? Sure. Why didn’t you just go down 3rd? Uh, there’s a high school on 3rd. So? I’m not allowed to go within a quarter mile of any schools. Oh, right. I’m sorry, I didn’t even... It’s alright. It’s uh... I’m sorry for all the trouble my family has caused you. Hey, you know what? That was the old story. I’m starting a new one tonight. Yes, absolutely. I will get you those new numbers by this time tomorrow. Ok, no. Everything else is on track. Well, thank you very much. Ok. Goodbye. David, are you happy? Of course I’m happy. But at the moment I am also super stressed out about work so whatever it is that you think I’m thinking please stop thinking it. I thought we were set, you know? Here, in this house. I thought we were gonna have a baby the old fashioned way. I thought my mother would be here to see that. I know you did. Look, come on. Let me tuck you into bed, alright? You never liked my mother. Yeah, you know what Shelly? She never really liked me, either. But can we please not do this right now? No. Hi. Hi. I’ve arranged with the chef for dessert on the house. Thank you. I felt so bad for you the last time you were here. Are you sure you don’t want any? No, I’m sticking with water tonight, thank you very much. I’m good. You two make such a cute couple. No, we’re not- no, we’re not a couple. We’re friends. Yes. You know what? Maybe this would be a good time for some music. Definitely. Really? Yeah. This place is nice. Isn’t it? Everything’s changed here so much. I told you. It’s really... Everything has changed. Something special. Oh. Cheers. Cheers. To new beginnings. Cooper, party of two? Hey, hey. I’ve been here for over an hour. I told you it would be 90 minutes, sir. Please sit down. This place isn’t so nice that you can just treat people like this. Hey, buddy. Watch it, buddy. Hey, relax. I’m trying to save you from yourself here, ok? Relax. Ok, how about we just step outside- Hey, whoa! Curt! Let him go! Let him go! Think of your record, Curt! I know about my damn record, alright?! It’s not something I can forget. Let him go, Curt. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. We should just- let’s just go. Let’s go. Please, can we go? I’m sorry. Hey. What’re you doing down here? Wait, where is David? I’ve been asking myself the same question. Oh boy. What’s going on? He keeps coming home later and later. Angela, I don’t know what’s going on with him. Then you have to ask him. It’s better to know than to wonder. You guys have a baby coming and I’m telling you, you can’t keep secrets from each other. That will destroy you. I know. David, we need to talk. Listen, I know that I’ve not been that easy to live with for the past few months but now I can finally tell you why. Ok. It’s about the promotion. It’s down to two people. It’s me and Nora Johnson but here’s the thing. You know how the firm’s expanding in Asia? Yeah. Shel, the job’s in Shanghai. What? You want to move to Shanghai? When? What about the baby? I can’t believe David would interview for a job in Shanghai without talking to me about it. And with the baby on the way. I thought we told each other everything. Shelly, here’s the thing. So much has changed in your life so quickly. You have a baby coming and it’s ok for you to live your life. If you and David are together with your baby as a family it doesn’t matter where you are. Oh, I’m sorry, my phone has been blowing up. Excuse me. I’ll be right back. Hey. Where are you? I thought you’d be doing research at the library today. How do you know I’m not at the library? Are you there, looking for me? I’m not there today. Oh, ok, well um... when can I see you again? Look, Curt, things are very um... complicated in my life right now and I... I- I can’t. You know what? I’ll um... I’ll call you in a day or two. I... I have to go. I’m really looking for- Hello? Wow, those are beautiful. Thank you. Angela, look at these. Wow. I can’t stay mad at David. They’re beautiful. You know, maybe Shanghai will be good for us. A fresh start. Maybe. Who’s Curt? Is that the guy that took you out for dinner? "I hope I didn’t scare you off"? Wow, drama. Do tell. There’s no drama, it’s just a joke a bunch of us had in high school. We’re friends. That’s it. Come on, Angela. The guy obviously wants to be more than just friends. Ok, I’m working here. I’ll go grab a vase. Ok. Angie, hey. Curt, I got the flowers. They’re beautiful. Listen, I am- You know what, I’m uh, I’m at work, I’m really busy today. Can I call you later? No, no, I’ll be brief. I just- I think it’s probably- No, no, no. I want to hear what’s on your mind, just- I can’t right now. How about I swing by your place after work? To- tonight’s not a good night. Ok, well then uh, you come to mine. Say 8:00? I really have to go. I’ll text you the address, alright? Bye. Hey. Here. Hmm. What’s this? "Chinese Made Easy" on DVD. Larry just told me I’m not getting the job. Seems you wowed Mr. Xang on your last proposal. Uh... geez, I’m sorry, Nora. Oh, be sorry all the way to Shanghai. I just... hate you so much right now. Good luck, David. Yeah, thanks. Yes! Hey. Come on in. Thanks for coming. I can only stay a little bit, ok? Yeah, of course. Well, welcome to my humble abode. Can I take your coat? No, I’m not staying. I just uh... Oh, sorry, one second. Angie, can you help me for a second? Sure. Oh... um... I’m not staying for dinner, Curt. I didn’t invite you for dinner. It just happens to be ready. So why don’t we... No. Oh, come on. I didn’t poison the food. You know me better than that. I don’t know if I know you at all anymore. Look, you keep saying that you want to forget the past and move on but you keep bringing it up. It’s like you want me to feel guilty all the time. Angie, I want to talk to you, I do. I wanna talk to you but I’m starving. Can you sit? Can you eat? Can we talk like that? No. I uh... Hey, you will never guess where I worked today. You remember Schwartztein’s Arcade? Yeah, I remember. That’s where I’m working. I’m out there all the time. I’m really sorry. I’m so sorry for what happened to you. But we were so young and I can’t keep apologizing and apologizing, it doesn’t change anything. It doesn’t undo the past. You need to move on and so do I. I came here tonight to ask you to please stop coming to the house, stop threatening to come to the house, stop calling me over- You sound just like your mother, do you know that? I gotta go. You know, I read somewhere that sometimes people who have had bad experiences don’t recognize normal social cues. Maybe I should warn people that they need to be patient with me. Yeah, maybe. Some people would say that you owe me something, you know. For what you did. Not me. I’m a nice guy. I don’t think like that. What is folklore? It’s the bedtime stories your grandmother told you. It’s the warnings your mother gave you every time you left the house. From the Icelandic sagas to the Brothers Grimm... uh... I lost my place for- no, no, I’m good, thank you. Ok. Sorry everybody. I just... anyway, I have been inspired by folklore and it occurred to me I’ve never written a word about the myths and legends of the very town that I grew up in. So my next book is going to... ooh... It’s ok, I’m a nurse. Oh, whew. Do you need me to call a doctor? Oh my gosh. No, I’m sorry, this is very embarrassing. I’m pregnant. I just think I got overheated. I’ll be fine in just a moment. I’m sorry, guys. Hey, Shel? Hey. I got the gig. You got it? Yeah. You got the job?! David, that’s amazing! Really? Really! We’ll have a whole new start as a family. It’s such a relief. I’m so proud of you. Angie, hey. Uh, hi. Hi Curt. Um, look. I really blew it last night and I’m sorry. I know you’re busy and I know you’ve got a lot on your plate. I don’t mean to monopolize your time. It’s... Curt, I don’t- I don’t want to cause you any more pain. I don’t. But uh... thank you. I- I think we have to just let the past be the past and move on with our lives, you know? I don’t- I don’t think we should keep doing this. It’s not healthy. I don’t think we should see each other at all anymore. Is this because you’re pregnant? No. Why didn’t you tell me? I tell you everything. I’ve let you into my life and you’re still lying to me. Why? I’m not lying to you, Curt. Really? Ok. Who’s the lucky guy? There is no lucky guy. It’s compli- look- Ok, hey, look. I’m sorry. You know, if there’s no father in the picture this is great because I love kids and anything I can do to help, I’d... anything. Sure. I- I gotta go. I’m not feeling great. Yeah. Thank you. Shelly? We gotta be there in 20 minutes, let’s go... Are you ok? What’s wrong? I’m just feeling a bit queasy. Maybe it’s sympathy nausea. I can go on my own, I’m a big girl. No. I’m gonna text David. I don’t need him to come. I want him to hear the heartbeat. Well, I will bring you back ultrasound pictures. You better. Yeah. Hey. You’re here. Is it ok? Yeah, come in. Ok. You’re nervous, aren’t you? Don’t be so nervous. It’s gonna be ok. Yeah, no, I know. I know that. It’s just that uh... I don’t know, honestly? This whole thing kinda makes me nervous. Hey. Hi. Alright, here we go. Ok. So you're 15 weeks now? 16. Hello, hello. Hi. And this must be dad. Yes. First time hearing the heartbeat? It certainly is. Alright, well let’s have a listen. That’s it? That’s... that’s the heartbeat? That’s your baby, David. Pretty cool, right? Good news, guys. It is a healthy and strong heartbeat. So any other concerns or questions? When am I gonna stop craving pie? Oh, bad news, that may never go away. Oh. Can I get a picture? Sure. Uh, yeah. Can you print one? It just prints in the other room. Everything looks great here, I will see you soon. Thanks. Check it out. I bootlegged it. That is so sweet. You think? Yeah, I love seeing this side of you. Right, as opposed to my usual selfishness. No, that’s not what I said. Although it’s good to see that you’re showing an interest in the baby. You know, suddenly you sound an awful lot like your mom. Which kinda sucks because I thought I was finally done with all the nagging. I just wanted Shelly and I to finally have some time together. Wow. I’m sorry. I guess I should just let you... I’ll see you outside... Angela. Angela, hey, wait up. What? Uh, look. You should know that the version of me that you see, it’s not the real me. For whatever reason nothing seems to come out right around you, but what you’re doing for Shelly, for us, I can’t thank you enough. I’m really sorry for what I said back there. Ok. Alright. Thank you. Hello, hello. Hey. How are you feeling? Much better. You look better. How was the appointment? It actually went really well. Good. Do you remember this? Oh my gosh. That’s dad’s old camera. I used to play "Shelly, Intrepid Girl Reporter" with that. I wasn’t allowed to touch this after dad died. Mom said I’d probably break it. Hey, look at this. Do you think mom kept a diary? That’s my diary. I bought it with babysitting money. I can’t believe she kept that. It’s blank. Yeah. You never wrote in it? Uh-uh. Well, mom took the key. She didn’t like me to keep secrets. We had a big argument about that diary. David and mom had an argument the night before she died. I took his side. Shelly, you’ve got to stop beating yourself up. Ok? You- you haven’t done anything wrong. Mom knows you loved her. You were her special girl. You didn’t disappoint, ever. Me, I was much more the daddy’s girl. Um, I’m gonna get changed and make us some tea. Alright? Ok. I’m so curious about the gender of the baby. Oh, hey. Hey. I seem to remember something about pie cravings? So, to Pippo’s. Fresh baked apple pie delivered to your door. You are my superhero. Give me a hug. Hey. You’re up early. Good morning. Morning. Yes, and I have decaf for you. I will grab an espresso on the way to work. That’s very thoughtful of you. Wow, thank you. Hey, um, before I forget, uh... Shelly seemed upset. She said that you and mom had a- a fight the night before she died? Uh, yeah. But what- what was the fight about? Do me a favor and kiss Shelly for me when she wakes up, would you? I won’t be late tonight. Ok. Huh. Oh. Hey, David? David. Hey, you forgot your phone. Whew. Have a good day at work, ok? Thank you. Yeah, get back inside. What the? Shelly! What happened? Come here, sit down. Sit down. Tell me exactly what happened. Highway patrol thinks David was on his phone. They had to bring him here by helicopter. They say that he has a fractured skull and a shattered pelvis. He’s still in surgery. Shelly, what can I do? What can I do to help you? Just be here. I’m not going anywhere. I’m not going anywhere. Coffee. Thank you. Hey. Yeah, sure. What’s the update? They got the brain bleed under control. Good. But there’s a lot of swelling. Now it’s just up to David to decide to wake up. That could take days or weeks or... the thought of being a single parent has never entered my mind until now. Hey, look at him. David is stubborn and a fighter. I bet as we speak he’s fighting his way back to you Shelly. Hey. We’re falling asleep. We should go home and get some rest, ok? No. I want to be here with David. You haven’t left this place. You need to go home, take a shower, get some fresh air. You’re no good to him if you fall apart. We’ll come back first thing in the morning. Ok. Ok. I’m going crazy. Curt, why are you calling me? Well, I was just in the neighborhood and I thought maybe I’d stop by. What do you mean, you’re in the neighborhood? Where are you? You sound upset. I am upset. I asked you to stay away from me. This has been a difficult few weeks, I’m pregnant. I need you to leave me alone, Curt. You know I’d do anything for you, right? Shelly? Shelly! Shelly! Shelly! Shelly, Shelly, look at me. Something happened to David! Look at me! Look at me! You’re just dreaming. If anything had happened the hospital would have called us and they haven’t. Hey, look at me. You’re just having a bad dream. Ok? I’m so scared. I know. I know, but everything’s fine. But I’m here now. Go to sleep. I’ll sit here. Ok. Ok. Alright, listen. I’ll meet you at the hospital after my doctor’s appointment. Maybe I should come with you. You don’t need to come with me. You need to go inside, have something to eat and then go to the hospital and be with David. You never know, today might be the day he wakes up. I’ll see you at the hospital, ok? Ok. The fire department said it was an electrical short. We should get the wiring checked. Yeah, we should. I’ll call an electrician. Isn’t your friend Curt an electrician? I thought I saw Meyers Electrical or something like that on the side of his truck that night he picked you up. Wow, you have a really good memory, you know that? Yeah, he is an electrician but um... no, he’s doing some big job downtown. I don’t want to bother him with something little like this. Angela, he brought you flowers. I’m sure he’d make the time to do it. This is my editor and I’ve gotta take it. I’ll meet you out at the car. Hey. C.J. Meyers Electrical. There. Hello. Hey Curt, this is Shelly. Angela’s sister. Oh, hey. Hey. Angela mentioned that you were really busy but we had a fire here and we need to get our wiring checked. I’m just wondering if, as a personal favor to Angela, you’d be willing? Of course, anything for Angie. Thanks. You know the address, just let me know when you can stop by. I will. We’ll see you soon. We won’t know if David has any brain damage until he regains consciousness. But Dr. Hooper says we might want to start looking at long-term care facilities. It’s really just another term for a nursing home with patients they can’t do anything for. Hey. I want you to think positively, ok? Now I read somewhere that people in comas can hear stuff going on around them. They can hear you talking to them. Talk to him. Read to him. Tell him you’re here and he’s going to get better and I believe... I believe that he will. You know, Angela, none of the things that mom used to say about you are true. My god, it’s mom’s birthday today. How could I have forgotten? You’ve had a lot on your mind, Shelly. So have I. I gotta take her some flowers or something. I’ll take her flowers, ok? You stay here. I’ll go do it. Ok. Get her her favorite. Um... You don’t know what mom’s favorite flowers were, do you? No, I do not. She liked hydrangeas, purple ones. I’ll get them for her, I promise. Talk to him. So many times I wondered what it would feel like if you were dead. And now that you’re finally gone... I keep waiting to feel something and I feel nothing. The flowers are from Shelly, by the way. I’m here for her not for you. Hi. Hey. Sorry, I just got your message. Thanks for fitting me in on such short notice. No problem. Happy to help. Uh, I will check your outlets, then I’ll check your fuse box. Perfect. Come on in. Wow, you guys have done a great job in here. Um, you know what? I will start upstairs and work my way down. Ok, great. Thanks. Ok. Just about done? Yeah, all finished actually. I uh... replaced the breaker on the house but the rest looks good. Thank you so much. I’ll go grab my wallet. No, no, no. No, this is on me. That’s very kind of you. You know, we might be turning this place into a rental soon. Do you know what other routine maintenance we should do to get it ready for tenants? Um... maybe-maybe have the roof checked, check for termites. Rental, you moving away? If all goes well we might be moving to China. Wow, China. Both of you? Of course. Well, let me know if there’s anything I can do to help. Thank you so much, Curt. You’re welcome. It feels so nice to be out in the fresh air. It does. What’s the latest update on David? The swelling is going down. Ok, that’s good news. Yeah. Yeah. Angela, I feel like I’m going crazy. Mom and David were the two constants in my life and right now, without either of them, I... Shelly? You have me. And pretty soon you’re gonna have a new constant in your life. That’s what keeps me going. I have an idea. There’s an old uh, box I found in the guest room closet and it’s marked "baby things". I don’t know if they’re yours or mine, mom must have kept them. Why don’t we get a big tub of ice cream and put on our pj’s and dig through it tonight? Don’t cry. It’s ok. Yeah. It’s gonna be ok. That sounds perfect. I should probably go and see David now. Yeah, go. But I will see you at home later. Ok. He’s gonna be fine. He will. Bye. Oh, I spoke to an electrician, they’re gonna come uh... tomorrow. I took care of it. Curt did it. Curt was here? Yeah, that’s what I said. Oh. Well, what did he do? Where did he go? Uh, he checked all the outlets in the rooms and the fuse box outside. Is that a problem? No. No, I just would have rather been here when he was here, that’s all. Curt, this is Angela. Don’t talk. You listen. I don’t know what souvenirs you took from my bedroom but I found your creepy stalker cam. I don’t know what you’re talking about. You know what I’m talking about. You are crazy. You leave me alone! Leave you alone? Leave you alone like you and your mother left me alone to rot for nine years? Is that what you mean? You owe me, Angela, for everything that you did to me. You listen to me, Curt. If you don’t leave me alone I’m gonna call the police. With your record they’ll put you away for the rest of your life. You stay away from me, you stay away from my family. David, please come back to me. We have so many good things coming our way. We have each other and we have a baby coming. But I can’t do it without you. You have so much left to live for. We’re gonna be a family. Please, David. I love you. David? David, you’re back! I need to get a nurse. I’ll be right back, ok? I love you. Angela. Shelly. David’s waking up. The doctors are optimistic. Ok, Shelly, that’s great news. And- and I don’t want to put a damper on that but I need to talk to you about something serious, ok? I need you to stay away from Curt. Do you understand me? Don’t take his calls, don’t let him in the house, don’t talk to him. If you see him you run in the other direction. Why? What’s going on? Curt...Curt is an ex-con, ok? He went to prison, and- and it’s changed him. I’m afraid of him and I want you to be afraid of him, too. Angela, you’re scaring me. That’s the point. Now you promise me that you understand. Yeah, I understand. Ok, I’m gonna head to the doctor. I’ll meet you back at the house later. Alright, well you and the baby are doing great. Excellent. Listen, I told you I’m in a big rush, I gotta- Yes, yes, I know. And- and thank you for coming in, but look. There’s one more thing that I wanted to talk to you about. I didn’t want to say anything in front of everybody else but you said that this was your first pregnancy? Yeah. But your medical records show that you’ve been pregnant before. Where’s Angela? How did you get in here? I asked you a question, Shelly. Where’s Angela? I can’t talk right now. Leave a message and I’ll call you back. I’m not gonna hurt anybody. I just need to know where she is, that’s all. She’s not here. You’re lying. That’s what I hate, is the lying. You know, your sister lied once and- and I went to prison for a long time because of it. But I forgave her. I did because we have a bond and that’s what your mother never understood is the bond that Angie and I have. She- she looked up at me and she tried to apologize. Like- like anything she could say would make it right! Where is your sister? Hi, I have an intruder in my house. Please, just tell me where she is. Please. I don’t know. Please just tell me. I don’t know. You’re lying! Shelly? Shelly. Curt, listen to me. Let her go. Don’t do this. Let her go. Angie, I’m so glad you’re here. I’m so glad... all those years in prison... the only way I made it through was because I knew that when I was out we could be together again like we were supposed to be. We will be together, ok? We’ll be together, but- but not like this. This... this isn’t you. This isn’t the good, decent man I know. Angie, do you know what they do to someone accused of rape in prison? It’s ok. It’s ok, it’s over now, you’re here. You’re here and I’m taking care of everyone who’s gotten in our way of being together. What? Your mother and the father of the baby... I can do this. No! No, no! Curt! Listen to me. The baby’s father is Shelly’s husband. I’m pregnant as a surrogate for them because she can’t have a baby. They’re not a threat to us. No, you’re lying. No I’m not lying. I’m not. You’re lying again. Please believe me. No. No, you’re a liar! You’re a liar just like your mother! Curt, she’s your daughter, ok? She’s our daughter. Shelly is our daughter. When we were in high school I was so in love with you. I was. And I got pregnant and my mother made me lie and say that you raped me. And I went along with it because I was 15 years old and I was terrified. I was terrified. And it was so easy because you were 18 and they tried you as an adult and it just all happened so fast. Why didn’t you ever tell me if you were pregnant? Because my mother told me the only way she’d let me keep you is if I went along with the lie and let her raise you as her daughter. I’m so sorry. She’s our daughter. I’m not lying anymore. I promise you. Look at her. Do you know what it would have meant to know that I was a father all those years? I could have watched her grow. I know. I know. I lost her, too, Curt. I would have been there for you. I’m sorry. It’s ok. It’s ok, that’s our old story. Right? Right. It’s our old story and we can all be together. Like a family like we were supposed to be. Police! Drop the knife! Hands up! It’s ok, it’s ok- it’s ok, it’s just- it’s just me in here with my family. Me and my beautiful daughter. He needs psychiatric care. He doesn’t need a jail cell. How could you? Shelly. Shelly. Is all of that true? Yes. It is. I wanted to tell you before mom died but I uh... I was scared. I’m sorry. I never wanted to hurt you. I never wanted to cause you pain. I hope when this baby is born that you’ll understand that I was trying to do the right thing and that you’ll forgive me. Please forgive me. Next stop, Seattle Marathon. Ok, easy there. Why don’t we start with fatherhood, huh? I’m sorry Shanghai didn’t work out, you guys. That’s ok. You know what? All this stuff happening made me realize that now I’m exactly where I need to be. Well, the good news is I’ll get to come visit more often from New York. Oh, baby’s kicking! Baby’s kicking. She kicked you! Woah. She? Oh yeah. We’re having a girl? You’re having a girl. Yay! I guess you can’t keep secrets after all. No.
