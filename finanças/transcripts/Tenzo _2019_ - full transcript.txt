Keep away from kings and officials; live deep in the mountains and pass down Buddha's teachings to a chosen few. Monk Rujing, Zen master Japan Soto School of Zen Dojo As a Buddhist monk's son, I'm expected to succeed him. 10 years ago I entered a dojo to become a monk. "Zen" is open to interpretation. In finite terms, Zen means to attain enlightenment. Master Dogen disliked this definition and called himself "the vessel of Buddha's teachings" as he pursued truth in the teachings. He believed Zen should be practiced around the clock. What is the best way to live this short life? Every second of this journey is precious preferencing no time or place. The teachings can be practiced by preparing and serving meals. Eating meals is another way to practice Buddha's teachings. As are the acts of washing your face and going to the toilet. Every moment of your life is precious and unrepeatable. Dogen taught us that everything we do in life can teach us. So he devised tenzo regimens outlining the monks' meal duties. May all sentient beings in the universe be equally nourished I finished my training and returned home. Sorry to call you so late. This is Chiken. I've been thinking... You know our cooking and yoga meditation classes... How about you include them in the Community Workshop? Yes. The theme could be "Food and Zen". SWEET One of Zen's six tastes Kounin Temple Do I smell calabash? Hi. Is Hiro up? I'll wake him. It's from a parishioner. A sign of summer! Now you know when the local vegetables grow. Maybe Hiro shouldn't go to daycare today, just in case. Right... I thought he'd be OK with milk by now. You'd think so. Mistakes happen. Calabash is good in miso soup or a glutinous soup. With kelp, right? You're our tenzo. I learned a lot from Hiro's food allergies. - I'm hungry! - You want more? It's delicious. Be right back. Hello? Yes... I had an idea. What do you think about the Youth Group making a movie? My cousin happens to be a filmmaker. So... My first movie, Above the Clouds was about you as Kounin temple's successor. I also interwove my own story into it. 15 years have passed since I made that movie and now I'm returning to the temple to make a movie. You really hated the idea of becoming a monk back then. So why did you turn around and become an earnest monk? I feel that it's my calling. Back when we hung out did you imagine that Japan would deteriorate like this? Never. Me neither. And that's why I think... we need faith now. "Slow food" and eating sustainably are two health trends that resonate with our monastery diet. In my opinion, its greatest merit is its synchronicity with nature which affects our well-being. I spent 4 years at a monastery and the foods I ate there cured my allergies and severe asthma. I have a 3-year-old son who suffers from bad allergies. What you learn here today will hopefully help someone at home. Let's get started. I work on a hotline for people who are in trouble. Every year 30,000 Japanese commit suicide. It's a big problem. In an effort to prevent suicide I offer support. What do you say to them? I just take their call and hear them out. That's all I do. Right... That's horrible! I'm not saying that you are horrible. You're too hard on yourself. Crisis Hotline To Kondo in Fukushima SOUR Soto Zen: Fukushima Tsunami & Earthquake Disaster Relief Mr. Kondo, it's from Yamanashi. Crisis Hotline - Hello. - Hi. Have you been busy? How about a drink tonight? It's on me. Everyone's welcome. That's kind of you but I'm on duty tonight. Oh, that... It's from Chiken. - How has he been doing? - Good. We just had this printed. BEATING SUICIDE Take it. I wish I could help but I'm a construction worker now that I lost my temple... You could still help us... Will you rebuild it? None of my parishioners live in the area so... Do you visit? The temporary housing? Yes, after work. Well, thank you, Kondo. I know you're busy. I better go. Say hi to everyone. Are you listening? Calm down please. I'm sorry. I took a whole of pills. I bet you don't know what I'm saying. I called the ambulance. 3rd one this year. Are you OK? I'm not OK. Hello? I want this I want that I want more, more, more I want this, I want that I want more, more, more I want them too but first I want to be able to love by myself Hiro, what do you want to be when you grow up? I'll be a monk. Is that what you want? Open the door. Step aside. What brought on that reaction? Aki said he ate a cookie before bed and it might have had nuts. It's anaphylaxis. The ambulance is making a right turn. EMERGENCY - Good evening. - You made it. - How is he? - He's asleep bout he's stable now. Call me if you need me. - Thank you. - Good night. Merci. - I'm itchy. - Hang in there. The speed limit is 30 km/h here. One question Where can I find happiness? TEMPORARY HOUSING IN NAMIE, FUKUSHIMA Hello! It's me, Ryugyo! Come in! Thank you. - How have you been? - Thanks for coming. It's raining. We'll perform the Hungry Ghosts ceremony. Thank you for joining us. - Who is it? - It's Mrs. Fujie about the funeral. Can't she wait? The funeral director needs to know. Can't you deal with it? Can't you see I'm busy? It's beginning. I apologize for the wait. I'll go now. - Thank you for coming. - You're welcome. Hello, Aki. Sorry but I don't think I can visit Hiro at the hospital. But he wants to see his daddy. But I have 20 more services to perform. I won't make it in time for visiting hours. Forget it. Don't go then! Kondo in Fukushima I'm far from reaching enlightenment but I always think about how to convey Buddha's teachings to people. One way is through "monastery cooking" classes. I wasn't sure what the participants would take from the classes. I figured that their focus was on the health aspect. But the reactions we're getting to the classes show an interest in Zen and Buddhism. As one teaching goes, "food is medicine". Food sustains life and it demonstrates the circulation of life. Would you share your thoughts on this matter. Hearing about monastery cuisine alerts me to one thought. It deserves consideration. Vegetables in Mongolia are imported because they can't grow any. In November the outdoor temperature is 40° below zero. It's like a freezer. They slaughter livestock that's too weak to survive the winter. And animals that are too old to procreate. They eat them during the winter. From spring to winter they live off dairy products provided by them. For Mongolians, abstinence from taking life has a different meaning. But Buddha's teachings are supposed to be universal. They should apply to anyone. The Mongolians' credo is "Do not kill unnecessarily". And it's fine. It's life even if it doesn't bleed. A grain of rice and a leaf are alive too. It's not just about not eating meat. It'd be arrogant to claim so. It has a wider and deeper meaning in its very definition. It would benefit you to be mindful of that. It's not a casual thing. I've never offered my life to anyone. Yet I consume many lives in the course of a day to maintain my life. I'm always reminded of this fact. We say "Thank you for the meal" for the lives we take. I was born into a family of monks. I was naturally guided towards Buddha's teachings. As a young child I accepted that I was to enter monastery life but later on I couldn't accept that I had no choice in life. So at one time I let go of everything. The temple, my family... I left home. It's good. It's meaningful to rebel. You need to rebel at least once. The life of a monastic isn't something to be handed down. It's something to seek and find from many choices. If it's handed down it seems of little value. You seek for it and choose it. That's important. In my case, my grandfather who was a monk, prophesied that I'd be a nun. It was assumed that I'd take over. I spent 11 aimless years at college, where I had a second chance to choose. We're greedy when we're young. I thought I'd find something more truthful than Buddhism. I studied Christianity and Marxism in times of communist activism. A man wanted to marry me... There were temptations. But those years gave me an opportunity to make another choice. I was determined not to return to the nunnery until I was free of doubt. So I stayed away for 15 years. Those 15 years made me who I am today. I'm so grateful for that opportunity. You won't stop until you find it. SALTY Welcome to Fukushima About rebuilding our temple, parish leader... I alone can't help you. Those who fled may never return. What do you think? I may die in another town where a monk will deal with my ashes. Kurashima, you work in construction. A monk removing debris... Where is Buddha's mercy? Come on, have some sake. Bring us Kokken sake! OK! Cheers! Kokken Saké (National Power) ZEN Is the monastery cooking class today? No. Then why are you cooking? Recently I only cook for the class so... I see, all right. Go ahead then! I give monastery cooking classes. My focus is on food and related things. It's in reaction to the food allergies my son has. He suffers and I thought there must be something I can do. But afterwards I wondered if allergies do in fact come from food. Maybe it's the damage we've done to the world that causes them. I began to think so. What should our mission be in the present? What's needed at this time? I think of the countless people who passed Buddha's teaching on to me over the last 2,500 years. I mustn't let the light of those teaching dim nor bend. The vow that Buddha took had to pass on just as he made it. That's my mission. SPICY HOT SHANGHAI New World Here we are in Ningbo. How long ago did Master Dogen visit Ningbo? He arrived here by ship over 750 years ago. What made you want to come? 750 years ago the only way of coming to China was by ship. It took months to come from Japan and it was a risky voyage. The ship could wreck. But Dogen felt so compelled to come that he risked his life. Why did he think it was worth that risk? What did he seek to learn? I thought I might get an idea by being here. Tiantong Temple Monks in the past had integrity, we need to restore that. Buddha's teachings guide people to the last, most peaceful place. Monks lead by practicing those teachings. Everyone in the world is searching for inner peace. We have expectations to meet. Monks corrupted Japan's Buddhism. There was hereditary succession and the "danka parish system" which the shogunate used for social control and to eliminate Christians. It wasn't about faith. When the Meiji Government decided to abolish Buddhism they made the monks secular. Monks should have a master and devote themselves to a search for truth. But apprenticeship was replaced by hereditary succession. Fathers aren't strict enough. If a father was strict, his son would be serious. The son of a monk should make a great monk but he won't. Only nuns managed to escape Buddhism's corrupt influences. Monks should rebel and fully devote themselves in his search for truth. Buddhism in Japan may be corrupt but the teachings are inspiring. They should be. Buddha's words will never cease to inspire. Stay focused on Buddha and Dogen. And think about what can be done now. To put Buddha's teachings in a word it's interdependence. Buddhism has no creator. Everything exists in relation to others. Not just person to person. Earth is 15 million km away from the Sun, in a gravitational balance. It can't be any closer or farther. Our solar system relates to the balance of all the stars in the galaxy. You see? As we speak, we're related to all things beyond the galaxy, whether or not you're aware of it. That describes the Buddha-nature, the essence of Buddhism. BITTER I think of all the work done for my meal to come before me. I reflect on what I did to deserve a precious meal. I pursue virtue and avoid the three poisons. I know that meals are medicine to nourish my existence. I consume lives, gratefully, in order to complete my journey. Thank you. - Are you home, Ryugyo? - Yes! Chiken! Welcome to Fukushima! - It's been a long time. - Come in. Thank you. Did you have a good trip? Thank you. - Sorry about the mess. - No problem. You had a wonderful time at Tiantong temple? I want to go one day. You sound really impressed! I noticed that it was similar to Eihei temple. Both are surrounded by nature. I think it shows how much Master Dogen loved Tiantong temple. I strolled around the temple's natural surroundings. I walked around barefoot. Barefoot? What's new? You live in a rural area. Exotic encounters are valuable. An escape from the mundane. Because it's ephemeral... Attaining enlightenment might be similar to that sensation... I'm sorry. Are you saying we're a part of the circle of life? You understood...? Yes, very well. But can you say the same thing here in Fukushima? "Others are not there to do your deeds." "Also don't wait to do what you must do." Crisis Hotline Thank you. It's me who's supposed to listen to your problems... Thank you. Make time in the day where you clear your mind. It's difficult in the beginning but it's worthwhile. Trust me. Make the room dark and quiet. Sit with your legs crossed, and relax. You shouldn't lie down. Sit with your back straight. It's crucial to breathe evenly. You can't force thoughts from coming. Let the thoughts float and don't try to force them away. Just let them stream. Soon you'll understand what it's like not to think. And you'll know the richness of that experience. I want you to give something a try. Immerse yourself in nature. It can be just a grassy patch. Take your shoes off and walk barefoot with your feet firmly on the earth and grass. It works for me. Don't think too much about it. The sensation is important. A long time ago, a man named Monk Takuan... You know of him from Musashi's legend? I read the series, too! Don't you love Vagabond? SUBTLE Rolling. I'm so old that I say, "My words are my testament." I ask them to listen. I want one or many monks to act like real monks. It all began with Buddha, with one man. To fail or succeed doesn't matter, you just do it. My mind, clear as water On its still surface the moon's reflected A wave breaks it into pieces which become a bright light which become a bright light English subtitles by Dean Shimauchi
