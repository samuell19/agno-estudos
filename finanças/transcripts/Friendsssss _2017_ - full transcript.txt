FRIENDSSSSS Stop playing game, son! Go your head down, son! Share your merit! Share your merit! Open the door! Share your merit! BANGKOK-CHONBURI You need to put it here. Believe me! Yes! Oh! That one should be here. So daring! Oh, Sense! Yo, Bright! Wow! I've not seen you for two years, you haven't grown bigger. What's so funny? I will grasp all your toys. What will you do? Huh? Are you a gangster? Go have fun with your friends. Still looking at me? Go! Oh, God! - Continue playing. Come on! - It's your turn. - Offal too. - Okay, please wait inside. Hi, Mom. I thought you forgot that I'm still alive. Oh, Mom. I've been studying so hard. - Let me help you. - No, you don't! You're tired from journey. Go take a shower. - And then come to eat. - Okay. Well, how long will you stay? It's quite long this time. How about one month? So you will get bored of me. Here you go. TONHAD RESTUARANT When will you stop doing this? I believe you. When we talked about the old times, do you remember Berm and Jeab? When we were at 12th grade and they made out behind our school. Do you remember? Now, she has two children. - Oh, really? - Yes. Actually, they certainly got sex after getting married. - It's so fast. - They are really sensual. They worked so hard and didn't continue studying. Why don't you do like them? Studying got me a headache. Better have a husband instead. Well... You think he doesn't want to? He wants to have a husband so badly. But no one proposed him. You too, Sense. How come you disappeared for such a long time? Since finishing 12th grade, you never came back. I have no time. I've been studying so hard. If we talked about lovers in school, I think of Dear, your closed friend's lover. Who is it? - It's Bomb. - Yes. He has gone for two, three years now. Dear is still waiting for him. I don't know why she has to wait for that bad guy. Don't you think? You guys don't be so curious. Let's cheers! Sense is back home now. You drank up! Why don't you wait for me? Cheers! Yeah! Sense, how did you go back home? Bomb! Bomb! Have one tablet daily, the same time every day. If blood pressure is better, you should go to see your doctor. And the important thing, don't be so stressful. Yes. - Thank you. - Thank you. Oh, Sense! When were you back? I was back yesterday evening, auntie. Take it as you want. Okay. Has Bomb been back home? No, he hasn't. Someone saw him here and there. But he hasn't come to visit me. I don't know how he has been. Last night I saw him. Really? Where? Is he all right? He seems fine. Just knowing he's fine, I'm glad. If he's not dead, he will come back home. If I find him again, I will bring him to see you. Please don't worry. Auntie, I bought you some medicine. There's nothing change around here. Something wants to be changed, but it's hard to do. You two really broke up? I'm not sure that we broke up. We had a quarrel. After that, I haven't met Bomb again. I called but couldn't reach him. I tried to make up with him but... Do you remember? In the old days, we came here often. On your mark! Get set! Go. Run faster, Bomb. Come on, Bomb! Bomb, fighting! - Bomb, fighting. - Come on, Bomb. Yeah! No. If you want, come and get it. - Come on! - Please give it to me. Sense is good at everything. Racing with him, I always lose. Oh, one thing he's never won. What? My good looking, I always win. Yuck! - Don't get over yourself. - Really. Do you think it's not true? It's true, I guess. I think you look very handsome. Please bring your girlfriend to meet me. I'm still single. Oh, really? Then do you have someone you like? Let's go back home. Sense, please park here. - Huh? - Park here. Drop me here. I will buy something. You go back first. Okay. So I go back now. Do you want to take a leak? Bright, you scared me! Who are you looking for? No. Go home. Let's go home. Mom! Mom! What's going on? Come here! Let's get inside. Shoo! - Oh, Mom! - What are you doing here? Let's get inside. I'm coming in, Mom. Come on! Oh! Why are you screaming? It's me, Grandpa. Why screamed so loud? Your mom will know it soon. Oh God, Grandpa! I'm gonna have a heart attack. Don't play like this. I'm scared. How come to scare? It's your house. You're still young. How do you get a heart attack? And what are you doing in the dark? I'm worried about you. I waited you for a long time. Let's go to sleep. Here you go. Mom. What took you so long? I think you will sleep at the temple. I talked with Luang Ta just a moment. Take this. What is it, Mom? It's your auspicious ordain day. To become a priest for 15 days. After leaving the monkhood, then the new semester starts. Why are you in a rush? Oh, no. There is an auspicious date. If I accidentally die, I can't catch your yellow robe to heaven. Sense will have an ordain in 10 days. Please come, you guys. I will send the invitation card to your home soon. This is a good day. On the house today. - What is she glad for? - Eat! Eat! Oh, Dear. Sense will be ordained. Please come to carry the pillow. Mom. Dear is Bomb's girlfriend. How come she carries the pillow for me? Oh, I forgot. I haven't seen Bomb for long time. I thought they broke up. Don't talk too much. Sense's ordain date, don't forget. We gotta go now. - I'm leaving now, Mom. - Yes! Oh! Hey, Sense, Dear, let's go swimming. No, I have an errand. I did not prepare the swimming suit. No need to wear any suit. So your dress will not get wet. I don't care. You impudent! I will kick you off the bike. Go away. - Go! - Go! How impudent you are! Sense! Let's go. This is where I saw Bomb. Bomb. Dear! What are you doing? It's dangerous. We don't know what's inside. What about Bomb? You will leave him like that? You're his close friend. Don't you worry about him? - Bomb! - Dear. Wait for me, Dear. What are you looking at? Retreat! Thank you. Ukasa wantami pante Sappang aparathang Khamata me pante Ma ya katang Punyang Samina Anumotitappang Samina katang punyang maihang Tha ta pang sathu sathu anumotami Have some vegetable, Bomb. Oh! Got you. Fighting! Shit! Take it back. Bomb. Oh, God! I'm scared. Bomb, can't you find the other way to get in? I'm so shocked. Are you crazy? This way is more convenient. I'm lazy to call you to open the door. Shit! Oh, how is it? - You deserve it, silly. - Right. Do you have a bandage? I do, in that room. - That room. - Yes! Sense! I think you don't have to study hard like this. You always pass the exam. Hey, Bomb. Three pork loins, please. Okay. You seem not so well. Yes. They used the weapon. Bomb. I think you should quit. If you're still on this path, you might be dead, or be in jail. Hey. It's about the male's dignity. What is your dignity? Your dignity always causes your mom trouble. Dear is also worried about you. Your dignity can take care of them? Think carefully. Where is the male's dignity? Hey, Bomb. Let's go! Bomb. Let's go. Bomb. Are you back home? Oh, good. Your mom is worried about you. I go to bed now. Bomb! Bomb! I know that you are here. Come talk to me, Bomb. Are you going to ordain? Yes! How did you know? Why don't you go back home? Your mom is so worried about you. And Dear too. I can't go back. And are you going to hide like this? What's your problem? You can talk to me. I'm your friend, right? May I ask you something, Sense? What do you think about Dear? Why do you ask like that? Well, I... Please go back. Okay. Hey, Sense. May I sleep over at your house? Yes, you may. How's Bomb? He seems fine. He's still the same. What did you guys talk about? I told him to go home. But he says he can't. And... And then some junkies came, so he chased me back home. - Dear! - What? If Bomb doesn't go back, please carry the pillow on my ordain date. Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Are you here, Bomb? Are you here, Bomb? Bomb is not here. Why did you come in here? Will you murder me? I won't let you do that. I'll murder you first. No! No! The dead one may be overdosed. So he's gone mad and hurt himself and died. Luckily that you took this video. It's a good evidence. Please come to have an interrogation. Yes. Captain, it's done. - Please check it. Okay. - They could now move the dead body. Let's do it. What was he scared of? What's the matter? Take a look. I think I'm acquainted with him. Hey! Why the ice transformed into this? Shit. Just put it in the glass. - Drink. - Oh! This might the thing that I scratched my butt. I will slap you. - Slap him. - Slap you. Hello, Sense. Come here, pal. He's my friend. Hey. - I don't drink. - Hey, he's my friend. His name is Sense. I'm off balance now. Sit down. What's happened to your face? - Here? - Yes. We beat our enemy. So let's celebrate our victory. - Then what? - It's so cool. Really cool. I think you should go see the doctor. Hey, make me a drink. - All right. - My friend has come. You don't listen to me. - More. - Okay. More and more. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. Just bruise, I'm fine. Right? Eat! Gosh! Have you gone to school recently? Right. If I'm in the mood, I will go to school. - Eat, pal! - Hey! You nerd, what's with your face? Do you have any problems? You nerd! Hey! - Hey! - Take it easy. Hey! You need to take that thing to your mom? Go back home now, nerd! Go! Go away! Go! Give me next glass. Okay, the ice... - Hey, Kai, Beaw. - What? I'll go buy some ice for you. Okay. Soda, too. He never listens. Cheers! Hey, Sense. It's from Note. But he already died. Before Bomb went missing, my dad and I went to my dad's friend funeral. He said that, "Note was beaten and is in a coma." He was in the ICU. And he was a vegetable over a month. Then he died. It was told that... the one who beat him was Bomb's gang. - Where are you going? - Hey. - What are you doing? - Go away! Come. Hey. Oh, I give up. Don't tell me that, Bomb hasn't gone back home because he murdered someone. And Kai... That ghost came to get revenge. And why Bomb murdered him? When Bomb was in that gangster, I did to spite him... by getting close with Note. Let's get dinner, okay? I told you many times to quit it. If you don't break with them, then break up with me. Dear, wait! What now? I promise you, Dear, from now on... I will turn a new leaf. Why? Why? What do you think about me? You always come and go as you please. Do you think I'm silly? I'm sorry. Okay. Would you like to break up with me? Before that, let's do this. Get off me! What? You take her! I'm bored with her. How many times? I asked how many. What did you say? I asked how many times have you slept with him? What did you say? I really don't think... I will hear those words from the one I loved. Bomb! Bomb! I know that you are around here. Come out and talk to me. Bomb! Let's go, Kai! May I sleep over here tonight? Oh, Bomb. Bomb, I think you should go home. Stop avoiding the problem. I want to go home, Sense. But I can't! Why? You know everyone is worried about you. You asked me that, how I think of Dear? I... I want to go back home, Sense. I want to go back home. I want to go back home. I want to go back home. Sense, I want to go back home. Sense! Sense! - Sense! - Yes! What the hell? What? Sense! Beaw. He came back. Last night, somebody saw him. Let's talk to him. You may get something. This way. Beaw! Come on! Beaw, it's me! Come on! What are you doing? Who's that? Beaw! Beaw, shit! So Kai and Beaw are dead, we need to believe that, right? It's because Note's soul returns to get revenge. If it's like that, next will be Bomb. Or Dear. Bright, you have such a bad mouth. Dear. Don't worry. You aren't the one who murdered him, right? But she's the root cause of it. Bright! Don't worry, Dear. I'm here by your side. I won't let you get hurt. - Bomb! - Bomb, where are you? Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb, are you here? Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Dear! Dear! Bomb, talk to me! Come out and talk to me, Bomb. I'm sorry. Bomb! Bomb! I'm so sorry That I made you disappointed when... How many times I slept with him isn't your business. Don't mess with me. But I have to commit I have to bear to see you go from me Better to be miserable with someone like me I'm just a sinner Bomb! Dear. Get up. Dear, you are such a liar! Bomb gave this ring to me. But I gave it back to him. I found it in the abandoned warehouse. I think he is in that warehouse. But he didn't come out to talk with us. But maybe... if you go, he might come out. Bomb wanted to give it to you, please keep it, Dear. Don't forget to review the lesson today. - Yes, Ma'am. - Don't be like the last time. I have to review for you once more. Bye, Ma'am. What are you doing here? Come inside! Go upstairs! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Where are you, Bomb? Where are you, dear? Bomb! Hello, Mom. Dear, I will go home late tonight. I have an errand. I couldn't finish it yet. I got to go now, Mom. May I go inside? Where have you been? I didn't go anywhere. I'm around here. I'm sorry. Sorry for making this trouble. Don't go away again. We won't separate anymore. Mom! Don't worry, Mom. We're going to find him again tomorrow. Oh, Grandpa. How about finding Bomb? Any progress? I'm at a loss on what to do. There is no hope. When someone said that he had seen Bomb, I hope to see him again. I can't find him anywhere. Now, I just want him to go home. No matter how he is, I'm okay. Listen to me carefully. Bomb is already dead. It was a long time ago. How can you said such nonsense! It's not funny. Grandpa. What did you say? I just talked to him. It's okay if you don't believe me. It's up to you. You should follow him. You know what to do once you arrive there. Please help him. He has suffered for such a long time. I'm sorry. Dear. I'm sorry. Bomb! Bomb, help me. Let's go! No! No! Dear! No, Dear! No, Dear. Shit. Dear! Oh, shit. Do you love each other so much? Go live with him. PLEASE STAY TUNED AFTER THE END CREDIT When do you finish, Best? Don't jinx it. I try to concentrate. It's over. Best, come to take care of Bright. I need to go out for a while. Come on! If my grandpa hadn't called me, I couldn't have lost. Hello, Ma'am. Why did you just arrive home? I went to play football. Don't play around this semester. Your grade was quite so bad. Have you finished your latest homework? Get inside. Your parents will be worried. Thank you. Bye, Ma'am. 18, 19, 20.
