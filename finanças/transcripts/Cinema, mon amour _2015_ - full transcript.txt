I've seen so many films that I can't name them all. The first guy walks off. The other guy doesn't follow him. Now, he does ! They argue. It's torn ! That's it ! The End ! Orwo. - How does it feel ? - Yes, it's good. My name is... Victor Purice. I take care of this cinema. I'd like to tell you the story of a child who discovered his thirst for the movies. A child who approached cinema slowly, step by step. A cinema that opened in Piatra Neamt in 1970. He was one of the first people to witness wonders ! He saw the opening of "Swan Lake" in 1970. He fell in love with the big screen, with stereo sound, and he took a huge decision: to dedicate his life to cinema. Before the fall of Communism, there were over 400 cinemas in Romania, all owned by the state company ROMANIA FILM. Today there are less than 30 cinemas left in the entire country. CINEMA DACIA in Piatra Neamt is one of them. This is the entrance hall to the Dacia Panoramic cinema. Once upon a time... people would queue right back here. - One behind the other. - Queuing. How do things look now ? Like this. Like the place is waiting. This is where I spent 40-odd years. We call it the projection booth. - How many spectators are there? - Right now ? Three. But they're here ! That's what matters ! Even if there's only one viewer, he is still the boss ! We're only here because of him. If it weren't for him, we'd have to take up farming instead. It's beautiful in Piatra Neamt, a fairy-tale city, if you come once, you'll come back. It's beautiful in Piatra Neamt, everything gleams, this is where I was born, and where I'll stay. This is crazy ! It's wonderful ! - I can't carry on, boss ! - What are you doing ? I've always wondered how they make movies. Cucumber, something pickled ! Come on ! Coming boss ! Just cutting up the pickles. - If we're fasting, can we eat this ? - Yes. What about some butter on the potatoes ? - We don't have any. - No butter while we're fasting. Look at all these delights ! It's clean. See ? It works like clockwork. Purrs like a kitten. - Now let's fix this one. - Which ? This one. It's dirtier. It goes in the back. Now for a quick breath of fresh air√Ω This is when people are supposed to come to the cinema. It should be full ! "Good evening !" "Hello !" But people don't come anymore. Only me, some crazy idiot. I get a bit down when evening comes, see ? - Don't take it to heart ! - It's impossible not to ! We could close up and go home. But why ! It's nice here ! When I fall asleep in the morning... Another sleepless night ? That's the way I've always been. - Dacia Panoramic, right ? - Yes. - Dacia ? - Dacia. Hey, Nicu, "Dacia Panoramic", right ? Don't get it wrong ! Good morning. We're back, with the guest of our live show, Mr. Victor Purice. The director of the Dacia Panoramic cinema. - Good to see you, it's been a while. - It's a pleasure to be back. How are you doing ? Surviving ? - Keeping the institution alive ? - Yes, we're still alive. I'm excited about the next generation. - The younger generation ? - Yes. I want to keep them happy, no matter what. By offering half-price tickets, for example. That way, they'll stick with me. Why has cinema fallen behind ? What are the challenges ? The internet ? Television ? The challenges come from bad management. When "Romania Film" took over, they sold what they could. - Only a few of them survived. - So they sold the cinemas ? They could sell them as they had good locations. They carried on until they all vanished. It's not dying and it's not surrendering without a fight. As long as I'm around, we won't give up without a fight. My congratulations on the work that you do. I have a great team to work with. - We're like one big family. - The "Dacia Panoramic" family. Mum, Dad, Grandad, and the kid ! Let's try the managing director. Where is he ? Let's call my boss. If he won't call me, I'll call him ! - Was he meant to call ? - No. He was meant to come here ! He'll see that I called. I'm disappointed he didn't reply, but he'll call back. Maybe it's too early for him. 10 a.m. isn't a good time for politicians. He'll be enjoying a coffee, he won't be thinking about me. But one day he will ! God has his ways. - Can you see me ? Hello ? - No, I can't see you. - I can't hear you. - Can you hear me now ? When you get back, there might be a surprise: a 3D cinema ! Will they put up a statue in your honor ? There'll be all kinds of things ! 3D ? Before you get 3D you'll need to clean the place up and get rid of the rats ! 3D is the last thing you need ! Look at my little grandson ! It's breaking up. The signal is breaking up. Clean the house. I bet it's a disaster ! We'll see ! I'm all alone ! Sorry ! Ciao Cristi ! Bye ! The image is terrible ! - It's not the green icon. - It's the yellow one ? Yes, let's move this here... Now it's supposed to turn white. See ? Yes, you said something about that, but I didn't understand. That's it. - The image is crooked. - I'll fix it later. Isn't it too low ? When we first screened "Titanic", we had 907 people here. - So many ? - 907. I'd never seen so much money in my life. - Are you loading the film reel ? - They don't use film any more. They do, but film is expensive, so they released it on Blu-ray. - It's much better this way. - It uses less electricity. But when we finish renovating, we'll only have professional equipment. Time, don't be cruel ! Let us be high school kids a little longer... Now comes the scene in the water. With the history teacher. I know this film by heart. I've seen "Star Wars" countless times. We played under the living room table. Our father made us light-sabers. With Christmas tree lights. My brother and I used to fight. We both wanted to be Luke Skywalker. We also liked the film "Mother". We'd roll around under the table. My sister never wanted to play with us. She was younger and had her dolls. Just as we're finishing, my back starts hurting ! - What ? - My back hurts. I'll do the projection booth before the film ends. I'm repairing front of the cinema. That's life ! What else can I do ! Otherwise it'll fall off on people's heads. I'm not the owner. But it's mine for now. Come on, let me finish here, then I'll clean the house. You won't come home to find a mess. Bye. My wife ! "Purice, you've gone crazy again !" - How does it look from down there ? - Great ! Superb ! Belissima ! Jolie ! If you don't say that, who else will ? When I get down I'll tell you whether it's great or not. - Come on, Lori ! - Calm down ! - It's no good when it's cold ! - Hot food gives you wrinkles ! Mamma mia, what a feast ! We're eating out ! We work here, eat here... - Like a picnic ! - Right. - You sold the tickets, right ? - Yes. Go and tear off the tickets. Let's eat first. - Want to make a bet ? - No. What time is it ? Want to make a bet ? What about ? I'm in. What do you want to bet on ? I bet I'll finish painting the sign tonight. - What time is it ? - 6:40 p.m. - Italy, right ? - Yes. Good evening, my love. I'm at the cinema, as always. I've repaired part of it, I've set up scaffolding. It's tough. I'll be busy for the next two weeks. Who else would do it ? It'd fall on people ! It's raining, I get wet, then it's sunny. I get wet, cold... I've not finished the job. How are the kids ? Aren't they coming home ? No ? Aren't they coming home ? Why not ? During the summer holidays, CINEMA DACIA will run films for kids at 12 p.m. You are in charge of this. - Can they move closer ? - Of course. The theatre is all theirs. One-two, one-two. This is such a treat for me ! And on a fasting day, of all days ! I've heard that you can choose your own film. - How many requests are there ? - Five. - Seven. - Seven ? You want a horror film ? Perhaps later. We're going to put these requests into the roosters bag. He's the mascot of the International Children's Film Festival. One of you can pick out the film we'll watch this evening. - Is that OK ? - Yes ! - I can't hear you ! Is that OK ? - YES ! Much better ! Let's ask your teacher to put the requests in the bag. Once again, it's a real pleasure to have you here. My goal was to bring you all here today, and to fight for you to be able to use it. It's your civic right ! It's not my cinema, it's yours. It belongs to everyone in Piatra Neamt. Read it out loud, young lady. "Frozen." "Frozen" ? Is that right ? You tell me I'm still young, Alex. But when you can't sleep, when you can't relax, it really affects you. In your bed... Because I know that tomorrow I'll have to meet the same bastards who make promises and still ignore you. Do you know how much that hurts ? Slowly, your life passes you by. I hope you won't end up thinking like this. But that's the way it goes. This cinema took up 20 or 30 years of my life. When people ignore you, it hurts. It's horrible. That's life. You drink a glass of wine, and feel better, you go home and drink another glass and pretend to sleep. You wake up. It's hard. It's hard, my friends. You cry, you pull yourself together. That's how your life passes through the cinema. Lord ! I'd love to see it full... ... of people again. Perhaps they'll remember me. I'm sorry to cause such a scene. Why didn't I stay at home ? That's life. That's how I spent mine. - Bogdan, your girlfriend left. - Fuck off ! - Run after her ! - Don't be stupid ! - Want me to talk to her ? - Yeah, go after her ! - Hey ! - We'll be back ! Magda, Bogdan likes you ! He said he misses you, that you're beautiful. He said he can't live without you ! He wants to go out with you but can't ask. - Really ! - Do you want to go out with him ? Look at that stupid idiot ! She said you're cute, she likes you. - Where's the maestro ? - Go on, Margi. I'll sing you a masterpiece. You should all sing. Let us sing friends, for all our hopes and dreams... - Enjoy the film ! - Thank you. - Where are the horror movies ? - Over there. It's on DVD. I gave a blanket to the girl in the skirt. - Why ? - She's cold. She asked if we had any more blankets. I said we have and I gave her one. It's horrible when winter comes. I hate it ! - How was it ? - Really good. Thanks ! - Hope to see you again. - Sure, we'd love to. I changed it ! And it's blown. Now take the fire back, on the other side of the wall. Victor ! Look at the smoke in here ! Look where it's coming from ! - Shall I leave it here ? - No, put it out and take it outside ! Look where the smoke came through ! Where there's smoke, there's heat ! We should set the chairs on fire. Two chairs every screening. It's like carrying a treasure-chest ! Look out ! Don't swallow the torchlight ! I'm not going to look. 25 minutes ? Perhaps I should look. It was 11 degrees, right ? So in half an hour... The room, not just downstairs. It rose by 5 degrees. That's great. It's superb ! I can feel the heat on my leg ! I can really feel it ! - Do you want to see a film tonight ? - We don't have any money. What about two-for-one ? - Tomorrow at 14:00, we'll be here. - You can choose the film. I've a surprise for you. Your old man Victor fixed the heating for the winter. There's a section where 50-100 of you can sit. So we won't be using blankets so much. Will you dance, ma'am ? - Me ? - Yes, you. I'm a married man, you know. Gently ! Want to keep warm ? Come over here. Look how much I poured here ! It's too dark ! - This mug is mine ! - All over your shoes ! - Stop poking me with your tits. - That's my elbow, boss, not my tits ! I want a massage, too ! Are we going to that romantic town tomorrow ? No. I've changed my mind. We're going to the seaside. No time to waste in Bucharest and Iasi can wait. The summer is already here ! I don't like it ! The snow makes me short of breath ! One blanket for two or three people. So there's enough for everyone. Take the back seats, too. Sit in the middle. That's where the heat comes through. - Give me the blanket. - No way ! Here, take this one. Are your warming yourself at work ? The audience is shivering while you're nice and warm ? It's worse for me. They're here for two hours. I'm here for eight. - You ? Or all of us ? - You only asked about me ! So, tell me what do you think ? I think we should put the heater back in the theatre. It's not doing its job. It gives out too little heat and needs more power. - Exactly. - Stops before it has chance to work. Before, it could warm about six seats. - I remember. - It makes noise, but it's warm. What we have isn't working. - You forgot the napkins ! - Yes. Go and get them, I forgot. The tea will get cold ! Thank you ! It's so cold ! - Can you see your breath ? - Yes. An old friend of mine... No. He was a cinema apprentice who worked at a place in Germany, got me in touch with.... His boss, a friend of his, wants to meet me. They invited me there to see the cinema. It's a wonderful idea ! I need to pay for the plane tickets. He'll take care of the rest. It's fantastic ! Yes. Fine. Let's speak later. I just had to tell someone. See you at work. Bye ! I still don't understand what you'll be doing in Germany. - It'll be an exchange. - Meaning ? I'm going there to see how the civilized world does it. And try to apply it here. It's different when you're actually there. I can take pictures... I can get ideas about the colors, the design... Don't worry about us, boss. We'll manage here. Come back with really good news ! I have a feeling that this cinema is next to or inside a castle. He's showing us his best theatre. - He has more of them ? - He has three. This is another hotel in the center. - Where are the other cinemas ? - There are no others. The other one... This one here... It was sold off. - What about a multiplex ? - No. - How old are you ? - 58. - I'm alright, no ? - Yes ! - You ? How old ? 56 ? 55 ? - 54. Just one layer of fabric. Carpet ! - Now there are two of us ! - But there are more of us. Listen, kids, I had some unbelievable dreams last night. What did you dream ? The Bicaz dam burst, there was water everywhere. How was the water ? Muddy or clear ? - It was water. - If it's muddy, it's bad. Clear water is a good omen. Anyway, your horoscope is good. The water flooded half the town, the part with the cinema. I held on to an antenna and when the water receded I came back down. But the theatre was gone. If you were there, you'd have started to cry. The state of our cinemas is a tragedy. They only have classic cinemas over there. "The Theatre Cinema". It was "Panoramic". They'd preserved everything. The cinema's name, written in wrought iron. Just as it had always been. They don't change it. - And was there an audience ? - There was... They must have, because they offer good facilities. The theatre was three-quarters full for "The Hobbit". Which "Hobbit" ? The last one. They were already screening it. And did I mention the seats ? When I left the hall, he asked if I enjoyed the film. "You can take 100 of the seats in January." "Come and take them, they're yours." "Yes, they're yours." "Give me some time and I'll get you 200-300 more." Now I'll have to beg people to help me bring them over. Nobody will help me. Someone offers them... For free ! I think it's time to put a stop to all these sacrifices and stop playing the hero. Stop wasting our time and money. Nobody cares. It's not worth it. Who benefits from all our work ? I don't want to become a poor, useless pensioner, who cries every time he passes this place. I should call it a day and move on. But I could never leave you here to suffer. I would not do it. Either we all leave, or no one does. Perhaps with prayer and with God's help... It'd hurt me deeply to know that you're still here, suffering. Daydreaming like I used to, hoping that things will improve. Thank you very much. Enjoy the film and enjoy your tea ! We left the tea-bags in. They even stopped using 35mm film... The boss told me... Two, no, three years ago... He changed a drum of the projector. And he said we had enough spare parts to last until I retire. And in the meantime, film disappeared. It didn't disappear... If the boss hadn't bought this video projector... - What we'd have done ? - I don't want to think about it ! It was a stroke of genius. This is real music ! I'm young again ! - Victor, don't move ! - I won't. Stay there... Right now, we're investigating the situation. I was honestly not aware of this situation. Our goal right now is to save cinema theatres. It's hard to say how we'll do this. We only started a month ago. We're still waiting for documents regarding the status of the cinemas. Anyone can turn up holding a piece of paper, as you know yourself. I'm sorry you couldn't bring those seats to Romania. If I had known, I would have helped you. And my colleagues, because it's been very chaotic they went everywhere, looking for answers, hearing they'd be sold or closed. I've lost faith in the unions, in other people, in everything. I decided to come here to find out for myself. I appreciate the time and effort involved in coming to Bucharest. I think we see things the same way. I can't make any promises, but we'll try. We have the same objectives. God willing, something good will come out of this. - What have you found ? - "Rio Bravo" ! Western... John Wayne. And it's CinemaScope, black and white. Fantastic ! You know how old this is ? Look, it's glued just like they used to. Film rolls brought so much joy and happiness. This is the stuff ! Not digital. Follow the line. How many are there ? One, two, three, four. - So ? It's perfect, right ? - Yes. - Can I do it ? - Try it. Not like that. That's right. Don't touch the picture side. - Can you see the perforations ? - Yes ! Look at the bottom ones. - They're not aligned. - They're not. That's right ! Now look at the continuity of the perforations. Can you see any mismatch between the two sides ? - No. - Ok. Now we use this. Let's see... Then we blow on it a little. Done ! - Won't it come unstuck ? - No. 700 people would be waiting in the cinema. I'd come from the train station with the film. There were no taxis back then. I carried it in my backpack. We still have that backpack ! They were so excited to see me. "Victor is here with the film !" That was the beauty of it. They greeted you like a king. Let me sing you the story of my life. I feel it's passing me by. People call me a drifter. They sneer and say: "I know him, he's a bad man, who doesn't know what love is." All he ever loved in his life is... Cinema. I never heard you sing before. But you know, it's not true. Nobody knows what my life's been like. I'm a tough old dog, and I don't care a thing for myself. But it's not true. Nobody knows what my life's been like. I'm a tough old dog, and I don't care a thing for myself. What about you, what about me, what about you. If you get to know me, you'll see I'm a kind person. I love life too, and want to cut my own path. I hate people who've only done wrong in life. I hate myself, for I too have done wrong... But you know, it's not true. Nobody knows what my life's been like. I'm a tough old dog, and I don't care a thing for myself. I'm a tough old dog, and I don't care a thing for myself. What about you, what about me, what about you. And I can't do it no more, look at my fingers !
