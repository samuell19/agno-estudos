It's a United Nations charter. We're flying emergency relief supplies to Da Nang. These are your people, for God's sakes! I am the people. (GRUNTS) (GROANING) (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (SCREAMING) There are no weapons, sir. Only food and medicine. Destroy what we can't take. But, sir, it's not an arms shipment. What are you saying, Lieutenant? We are making too many mistakes. You're the mistake. (GUN FIRES) Bury him. (DOOR BUZZING) I'll take some of those grits. MAN: You got it, Counselor. If you eat enough of that crap, you might just turn into a prisoner. But you'd probably like that, huh, Toliver? Take a nap, Brophy. Yeah. (MEN CHATTERING) Them wetbag motherfuckers' looking to plan something, man. It's like this. If they throw down, they gotta know they gonna get paid. That's what I'm talking about. MAN ON PA: Counselor Toliver, please come to the front office. That's right. Take your sorry ass to the warden's office. Your bitch ass in trouble. (ALL CACKLING) Yeah. (LAUGHING) I'm out, kid. All right, man. Major. Wow, you're out of uniform, General. Howard, I'd like you to meet Jameson Prescott, CEO and owner of Prescott International, founder of the Biotech Industries. Look, Toliver, let me cut to the chase. For the past two years, my daughter's been doing relief work for the United Nations. Oh, how nice for her. What's that got to do with me? Yesterday, the plane she was on went down, just shy of the border in Vietnam. Military intelligence has located the plane and the rest of the bodies, except for Gabrielle's. The plane was shot down by National Liberation Front, a guerilla group. Leader's name is... TOLIVER: Vinh Moc. Right. I read the papers. So what do you want from me? I want my daughter back, Toliver. And I'm prepared to pay whatever it takes to get her back, that is if you think you can do it. No. I don't think I can. Uh... (MEN CHATTERING) Hey. (GUNS FIRING) (GRUNTING) Bitch, look what you did to my motherfucking car! First you steal from me, then you go crash my shit! Look at you! This nigger gotta go. Raul! This is for Raul, bitch. (GRUNTS) Look at me, motherfucker. I did this to you. I do my fighting here now. Seen more kids killed on the streets than I saw in Vietnam. Gangs, drugs, riots. You just call up the National Guard and forget about it. You took one of the raza, the raza took one of yours. Eh, Querena, you can join this Pina . You're gonna die. (MEN CLAMORING) Now some little rich girl's in trouble and look who's here. A five-star general and her billionaire father. (GRUNTING) (MEN CLAMORING) Shit! Get up against the wall! Get up against the wall! You're dead, motherfucker! Yeah? Is that what you want? That's what you got, you pinche mayate. We'll see who's a dead man! I'll kill you, you wetbag mother... You're dead, Pina. You're dead! Hey, are you all right? I'll find your bitch! Just get me out of this shit hole! Butts, your bad ass ain't going nowhere. Shut up. I ain't got nothing to lose but 50 years off a life sentence. Do me a favor. Send me to Vietnam! MAN 1: Vietnam? What are you talking about? (ALL MUTTERING) Oh, you all don't know? There's a girl captured in 'Nam. Look, man, I'll find your bitch. That shit ain't nothing compared to what I go through out here. I could be into that. Beats the hell out of this pit. Shut up. Don't you think you've done enough? Maybe you're the one who hasn't done enough, sir. Say that again. What the brother's trying to say is you just riding the system. Recycling us until we end up dead. MAN 2: What you got to say about that? So, what's up? MAN 3: Come with me. Come on, let's go. You better walk these four guys down to solitary. Let's go. Guys, go. If I do this, I wanna take some of the kids with me. Oh, wait a minute, Toliver. I don't know about putting kids in danger. You want your daughter back? Yeah, I want my daughter back. Okay. I want a full, unconditional presidential pardon for anyone who survives the mission. We'll think of something. One more thing, and it's not negotiable, so don't even try. Name it. I want a $10 million donation to California Youth Services. Scholarships, libraries, gyms. You name it. Okay. Smile, Prescott. It's tax-deductible. Mr. Brophy. Two counts of first-degree murder. One Korean, one Chicano. What, no blacks, Brophy? I'm working on it. That's not a very Christian attitude. Screw them, too. (CHUCKLING) What's so damn funny? You. Guard. What, that's it? Am I going with you? Am I going with you? Mr. Lopez. You wouldn't happen to know anything about Jenkins being brutally murdered this morning, now, would you? Yeah, I know something about that. Don't nothing happen down here that I don't know about. But I didn't come down here to talk about no goddamn Jenkins. You look at me when I'm talking to you! I do what I gotta do to protect what's mine, ese! I don't have much in this world, but the one thing I do have ain't no man ever gonna take from me. Oh, yeah? What's that? Pride. Respect. That I'd die for. Pride? Yeah, that I'd kill for. (EXHALES) It's like this. If you got a problem, I'll help you solve it. I don't want shit and I ain't asking for shit. You think you're such hot shit, don't you, boy? Selling drugs? Gang banging? Well, let me tell you something. You're nothing but a disgrace. A parasite. So don't tell me what you're gonna do for me. 'Cause all you know how to do is take. What else is there, huh? What else do I got to give? What else do I got to give except my life? Whatever I take is what I get, you understand? What's your problem? You don't think I'm as tough as those putas, just try me. We're talking about a combat situation. Yeah, well, I'm not a moron, homes. Both my parents were killed, dead when I was five. And since then, I just got handed around from pervert to pervert, till one day, I decided I wasn't gonna take it no more. The next one who touched me, I took an axe and I just started swinging and when I finished, there wasn't much left of him. Michael Greer, a.k.a. Monster. Says here you killed two men with your bare hands, raped and killed a girl all before you turned 15. Sounds like I ought to do the world a favor and just kill you myself. Why should I give you a second chance? (SCREAMING) Wait a minute. Hold it. Keep him down. Keep him down. (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) Damn. (CONTINUES LAUGHING) MAN 1: You got a letter from your old lady. Mr. Toliver, hey! Mr. Toliver, sir! MAN 2: Hey, get back to work. Wait! I've just got to talk to him. Mr. Toliver! You're not going anywhere. Get back there. (GRUNTS) (MEN SHOUTING) That's it. All right. Mr. Toliver. Mr. Toliver! They won't let me talk to you, man! Let him go. I said let him go! MAN 3: You're dead, Lamb! TOLIVER: Where did you learn how to fight like that, Lamb? Um, Red Dragons. Is that a gang? No, it's a Chinese restaurant I worked at. One of the old cooks taught me. Don't let the boy-scout act fool you, sir. Seems Mommy and Daddy weren't giving this jerk enough allowance, so he killed them, in their sleep. That is a lie, sir. He slit their throats. That's bullshit! All I want is a chance, man. Get this guy to solitary. Hold it. Have his release papers ready with the rest of them. And don't screw up. Hey, thanks, man. Mr. Toliver, I'm not gonna let you down, man. I'm not gonna let you down. LOPEZ: Watch who you're pushing, ese. LAMB: You better watch who you're talking to there, tiny. TOLIVER: All right, listen up. From now on, my name is Major Howard Toliver. Now, before we go, I wanna make one thing perfectly clear. There's every possibility that some of you will not return from this mission. If any of you have any doubts about participating in this operation, you can back out right now and return to prison, no questions asked. All right, gentlemen, lady, move out. Let's get it on. (LAUGHING) (GIRL SCREAMING) (MEN CHATTERING ON RADIO) Hey, I just want you to know, this shit ain't over between us just because we're here. Are you threatening me, mayate? Nah, nigger. It's a promise. I can't believe I'm putting my ass on the line with you Boyz-n-the-Hood assholes. I'm hoping the niggers and the wetbacks just kill each other. (CHUCKLING) Best damn thing that could happen. You guys are all a bunch of losers, if you ask me. Nigger, didn't nobody ask you shit. (PANTING) Halt. Bring her to the camp. Oh, man. Vietnam. Just like in the movies. Yeah? Where's the '60s music, dude? Hey, homes, when are you taking these damn chains off? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Say, baby, why don't you do me a favor while you're down there? Hey, why don't you wait until I get my knife and do the world a favor? All right, everybody head to the Huey. Let's move it. Chopper? Didn't nobody tell us about no damn chopper. ♪ Take a number TOLIVER: Okay, you have exactly one minute to unload this Huey. Let's move it. Let's go! Move it, Butts! Move!

This is our destination. Plane went down near the Red River. Vinh Moc's camp is up in these hills just over the border. Now, as you can see, we got a lot of jungle to cross to get to Vinh Moc's. And we'll be hiking it inch by inch, foot by foot. Whoa. We ain't got a tank? TOLIVER: No, we ain't got a tank. Then I'll steal one. How do we even know the bitch is there? VASQUEZ: She ain't a bitch, you asshole. She got a pussy, don't she? That makes her a bitch, bitch. Fuck you. TOLIVER: Settle down, the both of you. In answer to your question, Vinh Moc controls this whole region. If she's alive, he's got her. So we go in, get the girl and get the hell out. No problem. Right, no problem, except we'll be outnumbered 100 to 1 by people fighting for their lives. What do you think we been doing? We start training tomorrow at 0500 hours. Training? Mr. Lamb! Sir. If you intend to kill us in our sleep, now's your chance. You got first watch. The rest of you, sleep well. I can tell you right now, I'm not getting no sleep tonight. BUTTS: Training? (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (GROANING) (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (THUNDER RUMBLING) VINH MOC: Good news, Gabrielle. Yes, we know who you are and who your father is. Thanks to satellite news. ...that an American woman was on the United Nations charter shot down last Thursday in northern Vietnam. UN spokespeople have confirmed today that that woman was Gabrielle Prescott, daughter of billionaire biotech magnate, Jameson Prescott. She is believed to have been captured by the guerilla forces of the National Liberation Front, a revolutionary movement committed to destroying political and trade agreements between the United States and its old enemy, North Vietnam. In three months, with you as my hostage, our forces will become 10 times stronger. Strong enough to defeat Hanoi. Do you think my father's just gonna sit around while I rot in your pit? Well, with Americans, you never know. But in your case, percentages are good. In fact, I'm counting on it. (THUNDER RUMBLING) I can't eat this for three days. Man, this is leftover from 'Nam. I know it. Why don't you ask Toliver to airlift you a cheeseburger or something? Why don't you airlift your ass out of my business? Guess they forgot the chitlins and the watermelon, huh? Why don't you just shut your dumb redneck ass, huh? Man, you better chill out. Toliver's coming. Screw that! TOLIVER: Morning, ladies. On your feet. Now! Get in attention, eyes front, hands at your sides. Eyes front, short stuff. Shoulders back. Butts, how was your breakfast? Terrible. From now on, if you're directing a question or comment to me, the first thing and the last thing out of your mouth better be "sir." That understood? (MOUTHING) Yeah. I don't think you heard me, son. (SHOUTING) I said, if you're addressing me, the first word and the last word out of your stinking hole better be "sir"! Now, is that clear? Sir! My balls hurt, sir! Now let me ask you again. How were those delicious K-rations, Mr. Butts? Sir, they suck my big, black veined dick, sir! Well, get used to it! From this point on, you will eat, live, piss and breathe as soldiers! You are on a mission to save someone else's ass for a change, not just your own! I work better with a motherfucking Uzi. What the fuck do you know about work? I know I worked your homeboy in the alley. TOLIVER: Monster, Vasquez! Ain't exactly what I had in mind for her, sir. That Monster sure is an ugly motherfucker. (BOTH GRUNTING) Come on!

Those towers are pretty heavily armed. Two 60-caliber machine guns, one GL7. Sounds like some serious shit. Can you see where they're holding Gabrielle? No. Probably have her tucked away under guard somewhere. If she's still alive. Sir, how we gonna get past those towers? Right now, our main concern is locating Gabrielle. We might be putting our lives on the line for nothing. All I know is she better be alive. I didn't come all the way out here for Vinh Moc's ass, that's for damn sure. Sit tight, huh? Till I get back. I'm going down for a closer look. Man, that nigger crazy. I think he was dropped as a child. (SOLDIER SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Hold on. We'll be back for you. She's alive. Listen up. The entire camp is surrounded by incendiary charges. Gabrielle's in a pit in the center of the camp. But first, we have to take out those towers. Sir, how we gonna take 'em out? With these. They're wired and ready. BUTTS: Shit. Hey, Butts, you take the tower on the east end. Sir, where's that at? Vasquez, you take the one over there. LAMB: What about the jeep and the choppers? Don't worry about that. That's for later. Lamb, take the tower in the north. After the dynamite's set, nobody makes a move till you get a signal from me, you got that? Sir, what about Gabrielle, sir?
