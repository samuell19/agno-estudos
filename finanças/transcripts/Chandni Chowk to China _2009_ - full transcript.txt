The only wonder of the world seen from outer space... ...is the Great Wall of China. The sole purpose of building the wall was to protect the land. The enemy kept coming. He fought on bravely. The greatest warrior of China: Liu Sheng. Today the wall is for tourists. The spirit of warriors lies frozen in statues. But the enemy returns. Hojo. The evil Hojo has the village Zhange in his grip. He knows riches worth millions are hidden here. He sells their treasures to foreigners. Sure. I'll talk to Dad about the shipment. You lazy dog. Go. Or your son dies! Hojo's treacherous games brought ruin to the villagers... ...and death too. They were helpless. In times of trouble, even the blind look to God. But help only comes to the drowning man... ...if he reaches out for it. The villagers sought a guiding light to brighten their dark days. The key to their survival lay in their past. Their centuries-old protector had returned. He was born again: Liu Sheng. Born in another form and country... ...their protector awaits them. You smile? You're done for. Where to? You're lunch. I spent 100 rupees on five lottery tickets. Only one. Let me win. Can't you help me? You do nothing all day! Oh, God. My winning lottery ticket is burning. Keep it then! You insult me. You tell people they were royalty in a previous lifetime. And me? A mosquito? Shut up. You burping toad. Do you know who I am? Chopstick. The only Fung Shastra master in the world. Get it? A Master of Feng Shui and Vastu Shastra. I get it. Indian noodles. Chinese curry. Put it down. I'm the only mosquito I know who works like a dog. Shut up. Here. See this lucky amulet? It'll change your fate. It has the mighty power of Fung Shastra. It's yours. How much have you got? How much? I'll check. Two rupees. - Damn. Give it to me. - Will my luck turn? Fool. Wear it and see. You'll be flying like a king. Dada, if I were a big shot, you'd have no food on your menu. Thanks to you, my restaurant survives. Right? Or I'd be begging at Jama Mosque. I know. You know nothing. If I had worn the amulet, who knows what I'd be today. Sidhu, you're naive. Don't get conned by those work-shy fools. Destiny isn't in your palm. It's in hard work. Hard work makes sweat. Not money. I need to get lucky to have money. Hard work will bring luck. Don't take it out on him. Stand on your own feet. Stop cooking dreams. No miracles will strike. How can a miracle strike? I never wore the amulet. Dada. Lord Ganesh has appeared in a potato. A miracle. Long live Lord Ganesh Son of Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva The charity box is there. It's not Sidhu's. It's Chopstick's cash box. Long live bank notes. Why did Lord Ganesh choose to appear in a potato? Mysterious are the ways of God. Pay your respects and move on. Four hundred and ten, 420 rupees. Pay protection money. Out with it. Don't pull his hand away or he'll rip my cheek. Easy. Cool air, please. Dada. I knew Lord Ganesh would send you in good time. Long live Lord Ganesh. No, Dada. Easy. You can't make an omelet without eggs. Bring the bride here. He shows up here too. The moron. Dada. Remember, Dada. You won't find another vegetable cutter like me in Chandni Chowk. I make the best curry. Mughalai... Where is he? Chinese? He's Chinese too? He needs to know he's Liu Sheng. Reborn. Tell him he's the warrior Liu Sheng. He must destroy Hojo. Destroy Hojo. Only Liu Sheng can kill him. Hojo has taken control of our village. Hojo decapitates our men. We have found you at last. You must destroy Hojo. How do I explain to them? They mistake a toothpick for an arrow. Chopstick. Good fortune comes from China and you show it a "Do Not Disturb" sign? If you tell Sidhu they want him to kill an evil enemy, he'll never go to China. Don't lie, Chopstick. He may amount to nothing, but spare his life. Give him a break. He'll love you for it. What if Hojo drinks his blood? Your Chinese ancestors are calling you. Go to China with him. And get rich. No. Don't listen. Walk the path of truth. Truth? It will mislead you. Why look from left to right? Are they speaking Sindhi? What's "Dado Hojo"? Your plans will go kaput if you tell him it means "Kill Hojo." Wing it. Dado Hojo means "the cool one." You're cool too. But they said a lot more. What did they say? They said Lord Ganesh has blessed you. His blessings have changed your future. And your past. You were no fish, fly or flea in a previous birth. You were a great and fearless Chinese king. - Liu Sheng. - Liu Sheng. Dado Hojo. I'm going from Chandni Chowk to China! Hello, boys.

Tell your sob story to someone else. I can't help you. Try asking around. Go on. Go through, sir. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. Excuse me. Madam, do you have a token? Go through. Long live Lord Ganesh Son of Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva O dear lord, master of all. You have answered my prayers. All I need now is Miss TSM. My forehead has become dented from bowing at Shiva's temple. I'll cook the finest delicacies for you. Your father, Lord Shiva, never heeded me. Please, Lord Ganesh. My God! I didn't order a dish but here it is. A woman as lovely as cake can only be a gift from Lord Ganesh. You are no ordinary dish! Lord Ganesh seasoned you himself. My number's been called. I'll be back. Rascal. What's happening to me? A fellow is dancing like a loony, I'll just check, sir. The token will be mine. Thanks to Dance Master G9. Give me back my token! Wicked girl. You bad girl! A bomb! Miss TSM! Sidhu! I'll give you a tight slap. Off to China! If you please. Okay. I won't go. I'm furious. Take your bags inside! No one can stop a hurricane. Not by cursing or kicking. Let him go to China. You crook! My shoe will land on your head and knock sense into you. Move it. You always trust the wrong people. You will never change. Let me go to China and fulfill my dream. Stop dreaming! You'll wake up and find you have nothing. What do I have now? No car, no house, no servant. Not even a mother on my side. I started life in a dustbin. I might end up on a rubbish heap. Well done, brother. Well spoken. You were so high when I took you in. I became your family. I raised you. And you talk of ending up on a rubbish heap. You trust that crook. You think a potato is a god. You don't have a grain of self-belief. I yell at you. I hit you. I'm nobody to you, right? So you talk of ending up on a rubbish heap. Very well. Be on your way. I don't want anything from you. Dada. For my sake, wait. I know... ...you taught me everything. You brought me up. My destiny won't be made here. It will be made in China. I know you will save me if I get into trouble. Dada, don't be angry with me. Let me go. Dada, if everything goes well, promise you'll come to China. Me? To China? No. Of course. If you don't come, who will kick me in the backside? How will I fly through the air? Tell me the truth. You won't let me go because you'll miss me, right? Don't lie. Be careful, brother. Danger lurks in the strangest places. And so with Dada's blessings, Sidhu set off to China. Let me close the bin. Our things will fall out. Are you stupid? The little touches that count. Jet Airways. Master! She's a wicked girl. Don't trust her! She's bad. Lower your voice. No woman can be trusted. From Chandni Chowk to China I haven't figured out who I am Look at my face Plain and simple Everyone tells me I'm a king Not a pauper Who threw a banana peel here? Chinese comrades! Ready? Have you seen your face in the mirror?

Stupid, stupid. Go to sleep. Are you both stupid? - Dado Hojo! - Kill Hojo! Lord Ganesh! I am in China. See that, Chopstick? Now he has the disciples, and you're left holding the bags. Flies love caviar as much as garbage. Look at him! He isn't even a flea. That's her! Get out of the way. Move. Stop her. She's a cheat. Where are you heading? Are you nice as sugar and spice? Or bitter as lemon? How did you turn Chinese? Or is it "do in Rome as the Romans do?" Indian arts are now martial arts, eh? What's this? How did this bun appear? - Who baked it? - Stop it. You said "tit." Sidhu, have you gone nuts? Why are you harassing the lady? That's no lady. Miss TSM is a cheat. I won't spare her. Wait for me! Who baked your bun? Get your paws off the women! Diamonds seized. Liu Sheng? An Indian. Go to India and find out who this man is. Hojo sends his henchman, Joey, to uncover the truth about Sidhu.

Like these ignorant folk... ...you also believe Sidhu is Liu Sheng. You mistake the monkey for the master. He's a loser. A vegetable cutter from Chandni Chowk. He dances to my tune. He's no Liu Sheng. Sidhu isn't Liu Sheng. Sidhu isn't Liu Sheng? Sidhu isn't Liu Sheng? That's what I said. He's a loser. He's nothing. He's a fool. I am everything. I am everything. This time Meow Meow has the perfect gift for Hojo: A way to kill Sidhu. Chopstick. Suzy. Suzy? Wanted? Sidhu? Wait. Don't tell her anything. Tell them what you told me... ...about Liu Sheng.
