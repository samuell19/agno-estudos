[ALERT SOUNDING] Hero Hotline. Please state the nature of your crisis. STORMER: This is the Hero Factory... ...where the bravest, most advanced Heroes in the galaxy are built... ...customized with unique weapons and technology... ...for any mission... ...no matter where it takes them. When vile, wretched villains strike... ...the most powerful force against evil is ready. Hero Factory, we build Heroes. STRINGER: Whoo-hoo. That went down as smooth as a bass riff. That's good. Because there's enough C-4000 on that transport... - ...to blow this whole asteroid to dust. - And us with it. That's why the Hero Factory was called in to guard it. [GRUNTING] - Ha. - Whoo. Make sure the miners know to stay below until we give the all clear. FURNO: Already done, alpha leader. I'm ready to come and join the team. You'd better stay in the Hero craft. We don't need a rookie underfoot. With all due respect, sir, this is my mission trial. Right. So lesson number one, listen to the team leader. But don't worry, kid, I'll let you know when I want you to join the fight. Wait, what fight? Ho-ho-ho. Here we go. Ha-ha-ha. It's Rotor. Ha-ha-ha. Missed me. No, not there. Here. Ha. Take cover. Away from the explosives. Oh, yeah. Good thinking. Rotor's here, so you can bet Xplode won't be far away. [EXPLOSION] Looking for me? Well, here I am. Hello again, Stormer. So nice to see you. [QUADAL CHIRPING] Alpha leader, this is HQ. Please come in. Stormer, report. Are you damaged? Would you relax, Zib, just a few dents. [QUADAL CHIRPS] Yes, Quadal I heard. The new armor you helped the science team develop... ...held up very nicely as usual. Yeah. But these guys are definitely using some serious new firepower. Oh, no, you don't. Hi there. [LAUGHS] [GRUNTS] [PANTING] [GRUNTING] [LAUGHS] [GROWLS] Alpha leader, requesting permission... - ...to come down-- - Not now, kid. [LAUGHS] [GASPING] Now, that's more like it. Ha-ha-ha. Let them have it. Yeah, take that. Hey, we just heard Alpha Team is under attack. Is Furno okay? He's fine, Breez. - Now, you rookies be silent or be gone. - Huh? We'll be quiet as Mercurian mice. Come on, Surge. I don't get it. Why won't Stormer let Furno join the fight? Oh, will you two--? Alpha leader must wanna make sure Furno is safe. FURNO: I doubt it, Breez... ...because I'm sitting on enough explosives... ...to blast me back to the Hero Factory. Zib, you're senior mission chief, can't you do something? I assure you, Alpha Leader Stormer knows exactly what he's doing. Doesn't he, Quadal? [CHIRPING] [GROWLING] Had enough? Of you. Sorry, Rotor, but it's every bot for himself. Hey. Hey. Come back here. Looks like your boss bailed. Hey, he's not the boss of me. BULK: Leaving you for us. Okay, kid, now. Hero-cuff this guy for transport. You mean, uh, alone? [CHUCKLES] This is your mission trial. Yeah, come on. Cuff me, Hero. Uh-uh. Don't even think about trying to fly off. Fly off? No, we're just starting to get to know each other. Can you believe the size of that guy? How is Furno supposed to get past those blades? [QUADAL CHIRPING] Ugh. [SIGHS] I'm never gonna get any work done. [ROTOR CHUCKLING] ROTOR: Oops. Ha-ha-ha. Try again. Ha-ha-ha. [LAUGHING] Oops. Ha-ha-ha. Right here. Ha-ha-ha. You think maybe it's time for a little Hero backup? No, no, no, I've got him. Yeah, right. [GRUNTS] Don't move. Okay, okay, you win. Now you lose. STORMER: Look out. FURNO: Hey, what are you--? [LAUGHING] See you later, fellas. What was that? Alright, I saw the weapon... ...I was handling it. I couldn't risk it. But don't sweat it, kid. It was my fault. I should have left you in the Hero craft. [GROANS] I heard that alpha leader was tough on rookies... ...but he's been on Furno's case from day one. He's right. It does seem Stormer has been riding Furno... ...harder than any of the rest. It's not my place to second-guess a team leader... ...and it certainly is not yours. I'm sure you two have better things to do than to pester a senior mission chief. You're sight. Sorry, chief. Quadal, get down to Weapons Analysis... ...and make sure they're working on new Hero armor... ...based on today's mission data. Huh? Mr. Makuro? Your evaluation, Zib? It does seem alpha leader is being unusually hard on Furno. Hmm. Perhaps it's because Stormer recognizes his potential. Or Stormer still blames himself for that ill-fated mission. Indeed a dark day in Hero Factory history. But what happened was by no means Stormer's fault. True. But since then, Stormer seems determined... ...that no rookie can ever put a mission or themselves in serious danger again. Ah. But Furno is not just another rookie. He could be another alpha leader. You really think so? I know so. Ever since Hero Factory's humble beginnings... ...I have witnessed the creation of every single Hero. They all possess greatness. But once in a century... ...one will stand out like Stormer did. And now, as I believe, Furno does. From the moment he began to take form... ...I sensed there'd be something exceptional about this fresh new Hero. Even the molten metal seemed to burn hotter than usual. But all the technology in all the known galaxies... ...cannot complete a Hero. That can only come... ...from his very core... ...which is made from one of the rarest minerals in the universe. Quaza stone. No other being possesses this unique heart stone. The Hero core. Let us hope he can overcome the many trials he has yet to face. If I were you, kid, I'd hit the training sphere. Start by replaying today's mission, see how many critical errors you made. I counted 18. Won't hurt you two to log in some training either. But we just came from doing a couple of hours-- So we're warmed up and ready to go, sir. What? Rotor didn't knock you around enough today? I just needed to-- To prove something to myself. Too bad you can't prove it to Stormer. Forget it. There's no winning with that guy. That's the thing, you guys. You don't understand Stormer. I've studied all of his missions. Right? And he demands perfection from every Hero. And that includes himself. And one of these days, I am gonna earn his respect. Or burn out trying. STORMER: Hold it, rookies. Please tell me there are other rookies in the plaza. Where's the kid? He was supposed to report to the launch deck at 6 sharp. Well, the last time we saw Furno, he was in the VR training sphere. On your feet, rookie. I was just trying to perfect this one move. For the next time I meet up with Rotor. - What's wrong with Furno? STORMER: He's fine. We need to get him into the Quaza chamber... ...for core recharging. You believe that rookie pushed himself so hard training... ...he could hardly stand up? Shocking. Now, the last time I saw one do that was-- Let me think for a moment. [QUADAL CHIRPING] That is correct, Quadal. It was a fresh new rookie named Preston Stormer. [SIGHS] BREEZ: Hey, Surge... ...remember the first time your core was supercharged. Furno said it was like something had been missing inside of him. But now... - ...I know who I am. - I know who I am. Excellent. All systems are once again functioning at full capacity. Alpha leader, I reviewed the mission record. You said I made 18 mistakes. You're wrong. [BOTH GASP] I made 19. [CHUCKLES] Get over to Hero launch. And bring your bike. It's time for some real obstacles, kid. Alpha leader, Surge and I could use the practice too. What are you--? We waiting for? Mind if I ask what kind of obstacles, sir? You can ask. OPERATOR: Hero Hotline. Please state the nature of your crisis. Hero Hotline. Hero Hotline. Please state the nature of your crisis. MALE VOICE 1: My transport pod broke down. This is the Hero Factory, sir, not the AutoPod Club. I know. I was forced to land on Tyral 9... ...so I'm surrounded by a pack of hungry looking Canabots. I've honed in on your communicator signal. Dispatching a team now. ETA, three minutes. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. [ALERT SOUNDING] MALE VOICE 2: Hero Factory, do you read? This is Lemus 2 to Hero Factory. We are under attack. Repeat, we are under attack. Affirmative, we received an alarm from your Hero alert system. Mission Control is already evaluating. ZIB: Only one Hero craft in the sector that can reach them in time. [MONITOR BEEPS] Lemus 2 Explosives Plant is under attack. - Yours is the only team in the sector. - What team? I've just got three rookies with me. I understand. But nearly all their security is already down. And, Stormer, there's enough explosives in that plant-- On our way. I think I have a pretty good idea who's behind this attack. Hey, kid. Looks like you might get that shot at Rotor sooner than you thought. XPLODE: I told you we should have skipped... ...that stinking little shipment of C-4000... ...and hit this explosives plant from the start. Oh, yeah? Is that why you left me there with the--? Heroes. Heroes? Are you kidding me? How did they get here so fast? Time to break out the heavy artillery. - Bulls-eye. - Ha-ha-ha. Nice shot. One less Hero to worry about. Whoa. They totally torched Furno's Hero pod. Nice. It worked just like Stormer said it would. Drew their attention while we all got down safely. Don't start celebrating yet. That plant blows, it could knock this whole planetoid out of orbit. Great, no pressure. Okay, this is it. You may still be rookies... ...but never forget who you really are. ALL: Heroes to the core. Stormer. Not again. Forget the others. Let's focus all our power on knocking out Stormer. Picking off the rookies should be easy after that. [GRUNTING] - Huh? - Stormer is down. The impact must have dislocated a vital power unit. You guys drag Stormer clear and cover him. What are you gonna do? To settle a score. - I hope. BREEZ: Good luck. Aim, you idiot. [GASPS] Sorry, pal. You can't do this again Xplode, you filthy coward. [SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] The explosives are all mine. Not gonna happen. Time for plan B. [GROANS] [GRUNTING] Easy, sir. I just reconnected the power unit. I'm okay. But is the kid? You think you're pretty tough, huh? Well-- What? Oh, no. Got you. How do you like our power-draining Hero cuffs? [GROANS] Ha-ha-ha. Okay. [GROANING] [LAUGHING] Ow. Quit it. [LAUGHING] STORMER: You did okay, kid. That's it? "You did okay"? Are you kidding me? Coming from him, that's almost as good as a Quaza charge. But, guys, don't forget, Xplode got away. Which means he could hit the explosive plant at any time. Are all the new security measures in place? STORMER: Okay, Zib. The kid and I delivered Rotor to lockup, so I'm ready to get back to my team. Yeah, nice to see you too, Stormer. Hey, Furno, congratulations again on capturing Rotor. Thanks, chief. You too, Quadal. [QUADAL CHIRPING] The battle definitely drained your Hero core. Report to the Quaza chamber for recharging. Yes, sir. On my way. [GRUNTS] Don't even think about it. What's wrong, Bulk? - Not a thing. - Uhn. Uhn. We just finished cleaning up the mess you left behind. As usual. - Hmm. - What about the new security measures? The Hero Factory's tech crews just left. No bot's busting into this explosives plant ever again. We're ready to head to base with the rookies and kick back. [ALERT SOUNDING] Negative. I need you to respond to a Hero alert that just came in through the Hero Hotline. - What's up? - I'll mission brief you in the air. Hang on, Zib, they've just got rookies with them. Can't you send another team? It's a Code 4 emergency, meaning innocent civilians are under attack. They are the only team I have in the sector. Okay, then I'll launch a Hero pod and-- You know the rules, Stormer. Hero Factory protocol. I cannot permit you to leave without recharging. Fine. So let's do it. Sorry, I already sent Furno to the Quaza chamber. Great. Stringer and Bulk are two of Hero Factory's finest. I'm sure that they can handle this crisis with Breez and Surge. I know. I just have a bad feeling in my core about this one. The last time I felt like this was right before the Von Ness mission. Von Ness. And we both know how that ended. STORMER: What's that? Your team has just arrived at Penitentiary 1331. A prison planetoid? But you said innocent citizens were in danger. You're talking a maximum-security compound with heavily armed forces. Penitentiary 1331 is still under early stages of construction. There are no prisoners there to guard. Then it sounds like someone wants to make sure... ...that it never opens for business. But who? SURGE: All the construction workers are in the Hero craft. Breez is flying them out now. ZIB: Affirmative. Tracking your Hero craft now. Chief, workers sustained minor damages... ...during the attack on their construction site. I'm heading to the nearest MediBot station. I better get back and help Stringer and Bulk. Whoa. What the--? Whoa. - The acid-tongued bad bot's back. - Huh? What? Hello, boys. Miss me? STRINGER: Corroder. Packing some heavy duty fireworks. [GRUNTS] Look out below. [CACKLING] [GRUNTS] Surge. The forecast calls for showers. Hope you brought your umbrellas. Look out. Never bring a boy to do a man's work. Surge. Uhn. [GRUNTING] Bulk. Bulk, talk to me. [GRUNTS] Ah. I see you've been practicing. STORMER: Stringer, can you tell how bad? Not yet. Gotta draw Corroder's fire. Surge. On it. STORMER: What's the damage? Hard to say. Bulk's pinned under a pile of girders. Is he...? [COUGHING] Down... ...but not out. Do you think the two of you will be able to lift the girders? Come on, Surge. Let's give it a try. [GRUNTING] No good. STORMER: They need backup ASAP. We can rocket launch a Hero pod. Oh, if I'd only had my Hero core recharged first. I'm recharged and ready to launch, sir. Nothing personal, kid, but Corroder is too much for a rookie. [SIGHS] Who else is launch-ready? How about Omega Team? No, they're on their way back... ...from a successful mission in the Centurian Sector. Both Jackson and Ryker's team just completed a mission too... ...but they're even further away. [CHIRPING] Ah. There you are. Maximus is charged and ready. STORMER: No. Max is built for mega force, not agility. Gotta be fast to stay clear of Corroder's acid. FURNO: Like me. Chief, I was built with the latest advances in Hero speed and maneuverability. That is true. And his synchronicity stabilizers are a modern marvel. I can do this. My best friend's in trouble too. He'll need to be refitted. Quadal has already notified the refitting tower. ZIB: Furno will need modifications specific to this mission. [SIGHS] Stringer can't keep this up much longer. [CORRODER CACKLING OVER MONITOR] [PANTING] I'm sorry, Bulk. Listen, Surge, you've got to help Stringer. STRINGER: No, Surge, stay with Bulk. Don't worry, I'm sticking with Bulk... ...no matter what. Surprise. [CACKLING] [GRUNTS] I'm onto your game. Time to finish off the other two. Ta-ta. Not while I still have an ounce of energy left. Whoa! Why you-- Uh-oh. Fine. I'll finish you first. [CACKLING] How long before backup reaches them? Counting down to Hero pod launch. Five, four... ...three, two, one. Launch. [QUADAL CHIRPING] Programming in destination coordinates. What about Breez? I just delivered the evacuees. I calculate I can be there shortly after you, Furno. I'm afraid both will arrive too late to help them. Perhaps they should activate a Hero cell. No way. Bulk's core is already too drained. Zib's right, Stormer, and you know it. We should activate a Hero cell. All right. The rookie will have to cover Stringer. [GRUNTING] [CORRODER CACKLING] Ready, Surge? [CACKLING] Go. No fair. No ganging up on me. Never had to do this before. Me neither. What is a Hero cell? Our only shot. CORRODER: Wanna play rough, eh? I was just starting to enjoy myself. Here he comes. - Don't move. - But-- Whoa, what's happening? There you are. Say goodbye, Heroes. [CACKLING] Cool. So we're safe. For now. As long as our core energy doesn't run out. Wait. You mean, we're draining our Hero cores? Which is why a Hero cell is only used as a last resort. No fair. That can't be. No. How you holding up, Bulk? [COUGHS] Better than you, I'll bet. You know Stormer. He's probably blaming himself for all this. Save your strength. We can argue about it when you get back here. Heh. For the record, Von Ness wasn't your fault either. I should have seen it coming. Forget it. You just be quiet and conserve power. That's an order. What's the deal? Who's Von Ness? Happened back when Stormer was just a rookie himself. His Hero team was called to New Stellac City. They arrived at dawn... ...answering a routine burglary call. Thresher brought two rookies with him: Stormer and Von Ness. They quickly realized there was nothing routine about this mission. And that's when things went really bad. FURNO: Stormer. Stormer. Stormer. Alpha leader, do you copy? Yeah. Where are you? Approaching the mission site. STORMER: Slow it down, kid. You're going in too fast. [QUADAL CHIRPING] Furno, keep it on autopilot. You have limited training in Hero pod landing procedures. Can't argue that, sir. But it does give me an idea. I don't care if it takes all day. I am going to get through to you. Few more seconds we're gonna be toast. Almost there. [SCREAMING] [GROANS] Thought you were pretty clever. But you're all mine the second you step out. FURNO: That's why I decided to flip out instead. How the--? Aah! Ha. The kid used his ejector seat. Well, I figured I had more practice bailing than landing. Practice bailing from this. [GASPS] We could lose Bulk if we keep the Hero cell up any longer. So let's give Furno a hand taking down that-- Whoa. Not feeling too steady. The Hero cell drained us all, but we need to be ready, just in case. That wasn't nice. Take that. Here's acid in your eye. Furno. [GASPING] [CACKLING] Now to see if my Hero is the way I like it. Deep fried. [GRUNTING] [LAUGHS] Acid-resistant armor. [LAUGHS] You had enough? [CORRODER CACKLING] [GASPS] Hey, Corroder, think you can handle another six fresh Heroes? Good one, Furno. Nice bluff, kid. Time for my exit. [BEEPS] This joint won't be opening any time soon. Just in case. So long, suckers. [CORRODER CACKLING] Too bad. Okay, he's gone. We're clear. See if you can lift the girders, otherwise you'll-- I grabbed the levitation unit from the Hero craft. Good thinking, Breez. Glad he appreciates one of us. Well, I think you were brilliant, Furno. Thanks, Breez. How's Bulk? Ready to bust out of this prison. BREEZ: Get ready. I'll keep the girder steady while you ease him out. Yeah. [BEEPING] Will he be okay? Please stand by. Just a few minutes later and Bulk would have needed a core transplant. Meaning the Bulk we all know and love to tease... ...would never have been the same again. Our core makes us who we are. You got it. Hey. Ha, ha. How you feeling, big guy? Good as new. But I gotta admit, for a while there.... I hear that. You know, when you were talking about that Von Ness mission... ...I was seriously thinking we might not make it back from this one. Least not all in one piece. And thank goodness you did. Now, the rest of you need to report to Hero Core Recharge. - Then after that, to the refitting tower for-- - Jeez, the guy's worse than my mother. Well, if I'd had a mother, that is. [ALL LAUGHING] Sure, you laugh now, but don't you dare blame me... ...if you're not mission ready the next time we call. - I'm up. - I'll go. You're alpha leader. You should go first. Tell you what, kid, you can beat me there... - ...it's all yours. - Ha-ha-ha. You're on. STORMER: Ha. Is that all you got? FURNO: I got you. - Ha-ha-ha. You know, Quad, something tells me... ...this is just the beginning between those two. [ALL LAUGHING] [CHIRPING] [ALERT BLARING] [ALL CHEERING] Is that all you got, kid? And you call yourself a Hero? I'm working on it. Oh, guys, I forgot to tell you. I've been asked to do a commercial for a new drink called RoboJolt. - Oh, how mag is that? - Totally. - What do you think, alpha leader? - I think we're Heroes, not rock stars. Wait. Didn't I hear there's a new monster size electro-billboard of you... ...right in the center of Makuhero City... ...sir? It was just supposed to be a little poster, the ad guys duped us... ...and put up a monster billboard. If I had my way, I'd rip the stinking thing down. ZIB: All right, Heroes, listen up. The Hero Hotline had just received an alert from the Mekronite Planetoid Belt. Mekron City law enforcement is requesting immediate HF backup. - I know the chief there. - My thoughts exactly. Kick throttle, kid. - Mission brief. - There is very little to report. We're unable to raise anyone... ...since the distress call came in from Chief Drax. - Drax is the real deal. - Yes, he is. In most of the outer cities... ...the police force is made up of FEDs, Floater Enforcer Drones. So be careful. We're coming up on Mekron City. It looks abandoned. What happened? The city goes on lockdown in an emergency. Okay, rookies, playtime's over. Let's find Chief Drax. You three, secure the perimeter. I'll go in first. The lobby appears empty, but my sensors are picking up-- Freeze it right there. Easy there, Stormer. Good to see you again. I'm just sorry we had to drag you out here on a false alarm. Where's the rest of the Alpha Team? They're just waiting for the all clear. Come ahead, it's a Code 13. Hey, do you guys remember what a Code 13 is? Yeah, trouble. So why'd you sound the Hero Factory alert? Eh. It's nothing to worry about. One of the FEDs malfunctioned. Then you won't mind us having a look around. Routine Hero procedure after an alert. You understand. No, I don't understand... ...and I won't tolerate my authority being challenged in my own precinct. Come on, chief, you know I have to be sure... ...that no one is hidden nearby with a weapon... ...forcing you to do what they want. [CACKLING] I don't need anyone to tell me what to do with lousy Heroes. I don't wanna hurt you, Drax. Funny, I wanna destroy you. I'll Hero cuff the chief. You use the drones for target practice. Good work. Looks like we're all clear. [CACKLING] The real danger hasn't even started yet. Geronimo. STORMER: Meltdown. Spread out and take cover. I just thought I'd drop in for a visit. No, wait, Meltdown? Isn't he the twisted bot that uses--? Degraded nuclear radiation. But I've added a little something extra to my arsenal. Think of it as a special bonus. Works fast. Who has time to wait? [GRUNTING] No. Well, I've done what I came to do. All in a good day's work, eh? [SPEAKS IN FRENCH] Why did you knock me down? I had a clean shot. So did he. - Are you okay, sir? - Yeah. Fine. I just knew a rookie couldn't handle one of Meltdown's-- - Radiation burned through his armor. - We need to get Stormer to Hero Factory. No. Must complete mission. We better take Chief Drax with us too. I just hope whatever Meltdown did to them isn't.... Well, you know. If Zib doesn't tell us something soon, I might just forget I'm a Hero. Supercharging Stormer's core clearly helped... ...but as Quadal is showing us with the X-Bot scanner... ...when his armor was compromised by Meltdown's radioactive blast... ...it left Stormer open to attack by nano-bots... ...which have infected his entire operating system. How's Chief Drax doing? The chief is in HF ICU, which is where you should be. Yeah, but we know you'd never listen to the MediBots. So Quadal and Zib are gonna personally monitor your condition. We'll be feeding data to the HF science team... ...who are working on an antidote already. Quit stalling, Zib, and answer the real question. How's Drax? So far, they haven't been able to bring him out of standby mode. But remember, he doesn't have a Hero core. Stormer, it's good to see you back to normal, sir. Far from it, kid. We saw what the chief turned into. Zib, as senior mission chief, you need to call security... ...and have me locked in a cell before it's too late. I assure you. Precautions have been taken. Zib thinks keeping me here... ...with you guys standing guard in case I wig out is enough security. But he's dead wrong. I could do serious damage... ...before you guys even knew what hit you. Like you'd ever harm one of your own team. Just trust me, you need to get me into lockup... ...before whatever Meltdown did to me takes over. [GRUNTING] Order Hero backup right now before it's too late. [SCREAMS] [CHIRPING] You're okay, Quadal. But Stormer isn't. [SIRENS WAILING] Activate emergency lock-down of all Hero craft and pods. No matter what, Stormer will not be able to launch and escape from Makuhero City. I'm warning you, back off or I will hurt you. Not buying it, Stormer. Don't you get it? Stormer's gone. - Bulk. - Aah! [GRUNTING] I got you. Stringer. Stringer, help. [GRUNTS] Thanks. I just didn't believe he'd do it to me. I don't see him. Stormer knows every inch of Hero Factory, he could be anywhere by now. Better report in, let Zib know we searched the entire perimeter. No luck, Zib. We can't find Stormer anywhere. ZIB: Available Hero teams... ...have been dispatched to comb Makuhero City for Stormer. What about the antidote? By the time we find Stormer, the science team will have isolated the nano-strain. I don't get it, doesn't every Hero have a built in tracking chip? Right. But even in his current condition... ...it seems Stormer remembers how to scramble his signal. Oh, yeah. He learned that trick back... ...when he was tracking that rookie that went rogue, you know, Von Ness. Hmm. I wonder. [CHIRPING] Science team reports they've deciphered the code needed to destroy the nano-bots. There's only one little problem. Right. We gotta find Stormer. All right, now we've got two little problems. Find Stormer and the key ingredient is only found on Lunar Tratix. So, Breez, you'll have to go with Stringer on this mission. Yes, sir. STRINGER: Zib, you'll have to suspend lockdown long enough for launch. - Understood. - Good. Wait for us. Come on, Furno. No, no, I got an idea. I think I know where Stormer is. - Well, I'll go with you. - No, no, no. It's a long shot. Plus, I think that one guy has a better chance to sneak up on him undetected. BULK: Okay, good luck. FURNO: You too. So I can go? Yes, you can. But I will have two full Hero teams on standby. So you call me for backup the minute you see Stormer. Understood. ZIB: Now remember, Furno... ...the nano-bots may have already wiped out the last remains of Hero Stormer. Leaving only a deadly enemy within. So, Breez, why did Zib single you out for this mission? In case we run into a Tratix reptoid. - What is it exactly? - That. Huh? Look out. We have to find the mineral. Start your scan. We'll distract the reptoid. SURGE: Over here. STRINGER: Hey there, lizard head. SURGE: Right here. STRINGER: I got a present. - Come over and get some. SURGE: Hey, over here. - Right here. STRINGER: Oh, lizard head. - Come over here. SURGE: Get me, snake breath. - I got something to show you. BULK: Come and get it. STRINGER: I got something for you. Got it. Just need to dig. SURGE: Breez, look out. [GRUNTING] It's got Surge. Come on. - Let's draw its attention. STRINGER: Here. Put him down. - Don't eat me. BULK: Come on, over here. [GRUNTING] Hey, Stormer. I don't know why you hate this thing. I mean, I think it's kind of cool. No? All right, maybe it's a little over the top. [GRUNTS] You shouldn't have come. Look, I've already called your location in to Hero Factory. The good news is, they've figured out the antidote. Our friends are getting the final ingredient right now. [GRUNTING] Too late for both of us. [GRUNTING] I warned you. Yeah, you did, so I know you're still in there somewhere. You gotta fight it, Stormer. You gotta fight it. Otherwise you aren't any different than Von Ness. Von Ness, no. [SCREAMING] Prove it. Come on, Stormer. Remember. Remember who you are, what we are. Heroes to the core. Zib... ...I'm bringing Stormer in. - How's the antidote coming? - Quadal, give him the antidote now. This stuff worked on Chief Drax. Yes, but of course, the chief does not have a Quaza core. [GROANING] The Science Team warned me about this. The nano-bots may have caused permanent damage. No, look. Look. [LAUGHS] It worked. Sure did. Hey, welcome back, buddy. Thanks, kid. Absolutely, sir, but saving you was really a team effort. Forget that. I'm thanking you for destroying that gigantic eyesore. I really hated that billboard. What I wanna know is how Breez got that Tratix reptoid to back down. Just part of my Hero programming. I can communicate with about 1800 species. ZIB: Quite remarkable, actually. Observe. SURGE: Don't eat me. I thought I was a goner for sure. For a second there, so did I. [BREEZ HISSING] FURNO: So, what did you say? I told her we were looking for a mineral. - Her? - Yes, her. And I showed her where to dig and voilà. Oh. Wonder which was more dangerous, the giant reptoid or the Stormer beast? [CHUCKLES] Neither. It was the monster that sent Meltdown to try and destroy me. Huh. So the Mekron police chief survived... ...which means Stormer has eluded me once again. But Von Ness will have his revenge. Stormer will be crushed, but this time by Von Nebula. Looks like it isn't your first trip to New Stellac City. "In honor of the Hero Factory. With special thanks to Hero Preston Stormer for saving our city." Wait. New Stellac? That was the Von Ness mission. Yeah. And this wasn't any natural disaster either. Right, Zib? That is correct, alpha leader. Anyone else starting to smell it? Hey, don't look at me. He's referring to the trap we just walked into. Take cover. [ALL YELL] [GROWLS] Thunder. In person. Hold on to your Hero helmets. Hello, boys. And Corroder. [CACKLING] Thunder and Corroder. This is alarming news. [GRUNTS] [CHIRPING] FURNO: Look out. Whoa. Look out below. - Whoa, heads up. - Furno. How many times do I have to tell you not to train in mission control? - Sorry, chief. - Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Whew. - That was a close one. SURGE: Whoa! [CRASHING] - We got knocked off course, sir. - Whoa. We're supposed to be learning how to-- Whoa, sorry. Try to use these new antigravity thruster rings... ...built into every Hero's boots. [QUADAL CHIRPING] FURNO: Ha, ha. Thank you, Quadal. Well, go learn somewhere else. We're in the middle of an emergency. Let's get down to see what's up. [CHIRPING] Affirmative, Quadal. Alpha Team, be advised. We are picking up unidentified readings from Thunder's weapon. I've brought something very special to share with you guys. [GRUNTING] What was in that weird blast? [QUADAL CHIRPING] Nebula gases. Are you sure, Quadal? VON NEBULA: This is only the beginning... ...of my revenge on the great Preston Stormer. [CACKLING] Okay, who are we sending? You're not gonna believe this, but you are going after Alpha Team. - No way. - Cool, Zib. Report to Hero Refitting at once. But before you go, I want to give each of you this. A particle separator. How's it work? I'll show you, but whatever you do, do not press-- [SIGHS] The button. Cool. That's amazing, chief. The particle separator disassembles the molecular body... ...long enough to avoid a deadly blast, and then.... Reforms it a moment later. Whoa. I feel like I got turned inside out. Okay, chief, we're mission-ready. Well, not quite. You have to have a team leader. Now, normally you'd be assigned one. But given the circumstances, you have to elect your own. - Furno. - Furno. Thanks. I'll do my best not to let you down. ZIB: Entering coordinates for New Stellac City. Launch. Launch. Launch. Stormer talked about when he was there before. Like there might be a connection to the old mission. ZIB: Downloading archive footage now. FURNO: Watch this, guys. It was supposed to be a routine Hero response to a burglary in progress. So Team Leader Thresher took two rookies along with him. And it all seemed routine until they found themselves against this hulking drone. Packing enough plutonium-cryptide canisters to level half the city. So they fired to draw its attention... ...while Thresher, protecting the rookies, made a run at the drone. Thresher took a bad hit... ...so Stormer and the other rookie, they're on their own. Von Ness, it's up to us to stop that drone before it hurts any civilians. No, we can't. We have to wait for backup. By then it could be too late. I don't care. I'm staying here. Okay, you cover Thresher and I'll draw the drone away from you. FURNO: Stormer decided to take on the drone himself... ...while Von Ness covered Thresher. [GRUNTS] [HERO CRAFT WHIRRING] But Von Ness had other plans. Von Ness. Uhn! Can you believe he was just gonna leave his injured team leader and Stormer? [GRUNTS] Bring it down now. No, you'll get us both killed. STORMER: Oh! It didn't look good for Stormer or New Stellac City. Check out what Stormer does next. Maybe the coolest move in Hero Factory history. First, Stormer knocked out the drone's visual scanning. Then, landing on its back, he cross-circuited the power supply... ...totally crippling the drone. Stormer saved the city and his team leader. But he never came to terms with the idea of Von Ness going rogue. Breez, talk to me. You picking up any Hero core readings? No, but the nebula gas reading just spiked. This happens right before I use this to blow Heroes away. Peekabo. All right, everybody, spread out. There's three of us and two of them. We can handle them. Ha. Need to work on your math skills, genius. [BOTH GASP] Because Xplode and Meltdown make four. [BOTH SCREAMING] Surprise. Fire in the hole. Ha. [GRUNTING] I'm surprised Zib sent you. Me too. How did you survive Thunder's blast? Quadal insisted I try out his new armor. Glad I did. So did you find Von Ness yet? Smart guess, kid. But, no, the coward's still hiding. Well, I think he's finally decided to show. [GRUNTING] Hero-link. Together we can keep from being dragged in. Stormer, grab on. There's someone inside that thing. It has to be Von Ness. Von Ness no longer exists. I am Von Nebula. Somehow he's figured out how to create a black hole. Listen up, team. I'm pulling rank. You stay here and take out his thugs. I've got an old score to settle. Same order goes for my team. Figured you could use a hand. I can't believe you disobeyed a direct order, kid. The name is Furno. Team Leader Furno at the moment so I'll give my own orders, sir. Hang on, ki-- Just hold it a minute. You realize we're doing exactly what Von whatever he calls himself wants? Walking right into his trap, yeah, I know. How else are we gonna get close enough to take him down? Okay, but from now on, I'm giving the orders. Glad to hear it, alpha leader. [GRUNTING] Getting real bored playing moving target. Without weapons, there's not much else we can do until they run out of ammo. Hey, I just remembered I still have something we might be able to use. The new particle separator. Zib gave us one too. Yeah, I think I'd rather be a hard target. Wow, I mean, it's like a living black hole. VON NEBULA: Very astute observation. Well, if it isn't Von Nutcase. You won't be so smug when I begin draining your Hero cores. So that's your game. Mr. Makuro's precious Quaza... ...will enhance my black hole 10,000 times. What can we do? Keep moving, don't give in to it. We've got to fight it right down to our cores. It's hopeless. You can't resist indefinitely... ...but I'll enjoy seeing which of you surrenders first. [GROWLS] Aah! [GRUNTS] BULK: Aww. Too bad, no more ammo left. [BOTH YELLING] SURGE: Hey, you. [GRUNTING] [LAUGHING] - Yeah. BOTH: Whoo-hoo! You forgot about one weapon that's not empty. Me. [XPLODE CACKLING] [CACKLING] Activate particle separator now. Oh, not again. [CACKLING] - Where did you--? - In your face. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] Aha. Ha. Let's wrap them up. Hey, where's Surge? Behind you. Behind me too. Oh, great. What do I do now? I'm sure all you need to do is reactivate the particle separator. Meanwhile, watch your back. [LAUGHS] Let's hope Furno and Stormer are watching theirs too. There's gotta be some way to counteract the force. I've got it. - Our antigravity-- - Thruster rings. For the record, I thought of it first. Well, that's if it works. [RUMBLING] The vortex is pulling us in like a gravitational force... ...so the rings should act as a centrifugal force going the other way, right? Or it could just set off an antimatter blast. Either way, we stop Von Nebula. Trick's getting close enough to the black hole without getting sucked in. So which one of us is gonna do it? I assumed all your fancy devices had been stripped away with your weapons. Lucky I've been monitoring you. I will take those devices now. You can try. If you can figure out which one of us has them. You forget that Stormer and I go way back. He always has to claim the glory. Then take your shot. While I take mine. No. Stormer is always the one, always first. Well, I guess you didn't hear, there's a new kid in town. [GRUNTING] No, stop. It will destroy us all. Yeah, I thought that might happen. Stormer, it's working, we're not being pulled in anymore. Uh-oh. It's superheating. Come on, we better blow before it does. Then run. You gotta be kidding, you actually think you can beat me? [BOTH SCREAM] [BOTH GASP] [GRUNTS] Call it a tie? - Ha-ha-ha. - For now. [ALL GASP] And what about Von Ness? Whatever it is, we need to get it into an isolation cell back at Hero Factory ASAP. Along with the rest of this toxic waste. [VILLAINS GRUNTING] CORRODER: Quit shoving. MELTDOWN: I hate Heroes. This is field reporter Daniela Capricorn from Channel HFX... ...coming to you live from the Hero Factory. I'm over here. Why, you-- Focus. We're here where Alpha Team is returning from an extremely successful mission... ...that has made intergalactic headlines. While we wait for them to-- [GRUNTS] While we wait for them to disembark, we'll take a short break. Cut. Listen, you little piece of scrap metal. I'll have you recycled into a little-- [BEEPING] We're still on the air? Oh. Well, we're back. Preston Stormer, reports have been coming in from New Stellac... ...saying that you saved their city again. Hey, he had a little help this time. And I'm not talking about Stringer and me. Meet Hero Factory's newest and brightest. Surge, Breez and-- Team Leader Furno. Furno, did you hear that? That's amazing. He just called me by my name. Newest and brightest. Well, you heard it here first. There's a new Hero team at the Hero Factory. Cut. You glorified hat rack. Just wait until we get back to the studio. Uhn! I'm gonna pull out your batteries. You mechanical menace. FURNO: Listen, Stormer, I know Hero Factory has the best protected... ...highest security vault in the galaxy. STORMER: But can that powerful an evil really be contained?
