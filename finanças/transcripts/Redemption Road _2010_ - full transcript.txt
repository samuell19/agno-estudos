But my wife, she says, "Hey, he just needs a little more time." So what did I do? I give you some more time. Figured I'd deal with you when I got back from my trip. Now, you ever been to Saint Louis? No, sir. It's like... Akron with a archway. So I figured when I get back, first thing I do is call Jackie and say, "Honey, why didn't you answer that phone last night?" And then Elmo at the bar tells me how you've been hangin' all... We haven't been doin' that at all. My wife don't say nothin'. (KNOCK AT DOOR) Bailey, it's Augy. I need to talk to you.

He has to walk 10 miles in the pourin' rain. Goes home, puts the light on, guess what? His old lady done up and left him, too. And killed his dog. Took his truck. Now, see, that's tragic. And that's the blues. Well, I guess that's one way you can look at it. You want another way of lookin' at it? Hmm. Blues and country music take pain and make music. What are you doin' with yours?

After a while it just seemed like she didn't wanna be found. So me and my old man. One day he came home from rehab, I think I was just 14. And somethin' was different. Not what he said, that was, you know, the same shit. But what he did. Taught me how to play guitar. He had this old guitar that he use to pawn when he'd go on a run. Somehow he managed to get it out of hock. We'd go down to this little barn, he'd teach me chords, how to play slide. He stuck around, stayed clean. (CHUCKLES) Man, he even started takin' me to school. Lasted for about two years. One night he didn't come home. I remember I went outside and waited. Waited till it got dark, waited till we got the call. He was on his way home from a gig and his car broke down. They found him in a corn field, about 100 feet from the road. He had been hit by a drunk driver. Guy by the name of Eugene Harris. Son of a bitch must been doin' about 80 to knock him that far. (LAUGHS) Doesn't that take the cake?

You need help with your stuff? I would love some help. Just down to the car, it would be great. Sure. Oh, don't tell me you got rid of the Mustang now. Oh, please! I got so tired of these old boys pullin' up next to me at every stoplight wantin' to drag race. So you here to sort out your granddad's business? Yeah, yeah, I am gonna go to the bank, Monday, and see what he left me. And then back to Austin? I don't know. There' not really much left for me there. Hey, guys, whoa. Why don't you say hi to Bailey? Hey, guys. Hi. This is my son, Scooter, and this is my nephew, Weston. Is Bailey going to play T-ball with us? No, he is not gonna play T-ball with you guys. He is really busy. Um, you guys ready for T-ball? Yeah? Well, I don't see any gloves here. Yeah, why don't you go back and get 'em? Go on. My God, you're a mom. I know. My mom had five of us kids and I have no idea how she did it. Who is the, um... Who is the dad? Harold. Harold Goggins? Mmm-hmm. Or Charlie. Charlie? Johnson. You're talkin' about the barbecue place guy? Yeah, Johnson's Barbeque. Yeah, I mean, they make a great pulled-pork sandwich. Yeah, not anymore, not since old man Johnson died, they changed the rub. It hasn't been the same. Although, I thought for a while it might be Preston. Preston Willis? Ew! No. Foster. But it turns out he's sterile, so it couldn't have been him. Yeah. I'm just messing with you! His daddy's a lawyer down in Tuscaloosa. We broke up a couple of years ago and moved back home. He's not a bad guy. Just wasn't the right guy. Do you know Santa's off of 565? Yeah. Well, they are doin' a benefit show tonight. And there's gonna be some great bands there. It's gonna be for really good cause. I think you... Got 'em. Great. Let's go. I think you should come. Yeah, I don't think so. It's to support education. Supports T-ball. Lots of T-ball stuff goin' on. I am out of T-ball support. It's gonna be great. Get on in there. Yeah, I don't think I would be able to find a sitter. I just... I don't think it'd be a good idea. It was nice seein' you, Bailey. You, too. (TAPS CAR) Hey, you guys play good, all right? SANTA: Did you talk to him? I'm tryin'. Don't tell me you're tryin'. I am holdin' this. That's doin' somethin'. Don't try to do it, do it. Oh, Mr. Bailey, how you doin'? How'd it go? Not so good. I'm gonna go get the room ready for tonight. Yeah, you ain't off the hook. But she didn't kick you out, did she? Nope. 'Cause she never even let me in. Takes a little time, you know. A little while to open up. Yeah, I don't really think she's interested. Oh, I ain't talkin' about her. I'm talkin' about you. Me? (STAMMERING) What did I do now? You've been closed a long time, mister. Ain't gonna change overnight. You know, what you ought to do is cry. (LAUGHS) You want me to cry? Tears is... Letting it all just flow on out. And blues is like that. Blues is like letting your tears flow. Now, how you gonna face an audience if you can't face what's inside you? You hear? Sure. Do you mind puttin' that back, please?

So the girl down the street said that she'd watch Scooter for time and a half. Really? What is that? I don't know but you must think I'm really worth that. Oh, um, I came because it's a benefit show. Oh, sure. I'm so sorry. Yeah. But, um, nice try. Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. It's a good one. It really is. Yeah. It sounds great. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Whoo! Oh, oh, oh, me-oh-my! Yeah, we're gonna have fun here tonight. Brother, preach. Go ahead. (CHUCKLING) We'll talk a little love here for a moment. You know, apart from the love of a woman, there are three loves a man needs. Love what you do, love the people you do it with and love what you leave behind. ALL: Amen. (SANTA LAUGHS) By the way, now when we get down to that, I want to point out that my son, Augy, is back in town. Yeah. Most of you know who he is. And he's brought a friend with him, who, I understand, really is an undercover blues man. And I happen to know that his daddy was one of the best blues men I ever heard. So, look out, 'cause Jefferson Bailey is coming up here. Come on, Jefferson. No. Go on. Get up here now! Bring him up here. Encourage him, come on. Go. You do not want me to do that. SANTA: Yes, sir. No, no, no, no, you do not want me to do this. SANTA: Come on, Jefferson, get up here. You can do this. SANTA: Yes, sir. All right, all right. It's about time everybody heard you anyway.

Of course, that was really nice. No, I mean, it really... It really meant a lot to me, you know. Whoa! Easy there... What? ...cowboy! I mean, I may be friendly, but I'm not stupid. You know what, I'm stupid. Oh, yeah. I'm stupid for letting you go and walking away from you... You have got some nerve! You think you can just waltz in and we just pick up where we left off? Well, I've got news for you. Where we left off isn't anyplace I want to be. Good night. Just... Just hold on. Just hold on a second, okay? There's something I want to say. Yeah? Yeah. Well, I'm not gonna say it for you. I'm sorry. You're sorry? Yes. For what? For... For that time that you wrecked my car? Or for those times that you'd just kind of like disappear and me not knowing if you're alive or dead? Is that what you're sorry for? Come on, help me out here! Oh! I know! You're sorry for that time that you left me stranded, in Memphis, at a truck stop. No! No? Yes, yes. Okay, yes. I am sorry for that. I am sorry for every shitty thing I did to you. Okay? Look, I'm... I think I was... I was really heavy. Heavy? Yeah. Like there was nothin' light about me. I feel like I dragged you down. I'm sorry. Good night, Bailey. 'Night. (EXHALES) Oh, man. Well, Mr. Undercover Blues Man hisself. What are you doing? Oh, stuff I hate. Ooh! I thought you were the guy who loves everything you do. Not this bookkeeping crap. I just... I'm gettin' too old for it, I guess, I don't know. Well, don't shoot anybody over it. That's Santa's Homeland Security. You seen Augy around? Oh, he's probably out with one of them honeys. Maybe both of 'em, huh? (CHUCKLES) Ought to be ashamed of himself. Augy, Augy. Was that hard-hearted Hannah you was dancin' with out there? That pretty little girl with all that wonderful energy? Don't walk away again, you hear me? Yeah. Hey, Santa, can I ask you a question? Yup. What made you quit drinking? I killed somebody. We were doing some concert north of here, I was drunk as a skunk as usual. Sally's probably sittin' out there in that audience wonderin' what she's doin' this man. Tells me not to drive, 'cause I'm too drunk. But I knew better, you know. I wasn't very easy to get along with in those days. And I must have fallen asleep behind that wheel, 'cause the next thing I remember was Sally screamin' at me, and I look out there, and I see we're headin' right for some man walking alongside the road. Sally pulls the wheel around, turns it, and we miss the fella. But the car goes off the road and hits this big oak tree. Sally didn't have a mark on her, but her insides was all messed up real good. She looks at me real serious and she says, "Well, I guess you're gonna have to borrow Marlon's car tomorrow "to get up to Mooresville." And passed. (EXHALES) Well, I did some time for that, and I noticed a lot of other fellows like me, lack self esteem. So I thought maybe I could help them. Teach 'em to read. Teach 'em music. They liked that. Music makes you feel good, don't it? You want some chamomile tea? Sure. All right. (SOFTLY) Who are those boys? (CHUCKLING) I didn't know you played with Big Mama Thornton. Yup. Long time ago. (LAUGHS SOFTLY) I like the groovy mustache. (CHUCKLING) It's a good look. (SOFTLY) Eugene Harris. I use agave for sweetener. (BREATHES HEAVILY) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) WOMAN: Good night, Augy. (WOMEN LAUGHING) (ENGINE STARTING) (EXHALES) BAILEY: What's your name? What is it? Hmm? Eugene Harris. Eugene Augustus Harris. Yeah. When were you plannin' on tellin' me that? (SHOUTS) When? When we first met. Tonight. Bunch of places in between, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, I bet you were. But you know what? You didn't have the balls, did you? You know why? You're a coward! I wanted to tell you. But I figured the best way to make amends was to help you. Help me? What, by showin' me you can do whatever the hell you want and not pay any consequences? Is that how you're gonna help me? I spent nine years in prison, Bailey. Yeah, I've spent my whole life there, partner, all right. So, why don't you shut up? I'm not sayin' what I did was right, in fact, (STUTTERS) it's far from it. You know what, Augy? You're the one who's heavy. To kill an innocent man like that. Run him over. Knock him into a field, while I waited there. Waited for him by the damn roadside! Waited for him all night long to come home. What, were you passed out while I sat there on the curb? Is that... Is that what you're sorry for? I'm sorry. From the bottom of my heart, I'm sorry. You took everything from me, you know that? Everything. (COCKING GUN) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (SPITS) (THUNDER CRACKING) Hey there. Can I help you? Yeah, I got this ticket. Do you know what it's for? No. No idea. Could it be a big, flat box? I don't know. (GRUNTS) You need help? If you want it today. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Just don't kill yourself. Excuse me. WOMAN: Hello? So, what ya got? Ah, something my granddad left me. Oh, I remember that one. Big fella left it a while ago. Said the rightful owner would claim it. Wait, like a big, black guy? Mmm-hmm. You got any scissors or anything? Uh... Thanks. What's that? It's my dad's guitar. (EXHALES DEEPLY) That's him teachin' me how to play. Must be my mom. (WOMAN GASPS) Oh, my God! What? What? (GASPING) That's me. What? That's me and Jeff. And... This is his guitar. What? You're my mom? You don't know how many times I tried to find you. Please don't hate me. How could you... How could you leave me like that? I was young and selfish and scared. But that's no reason to do what I did. But I'm a different person now. Do you believe that a person can change? Please. Don't do this to me. (SOBBING) Please... So I'll call you later. You take care now. Hey! Santa around? No, just us. You know, after... After last night, I just wanted to get the hell out of here. Collect whatever was mine and get the first bus back to Austin. Now I... Now I don't know what to do. You, um, you led me to someone that I... I need... I need to thank you for that. (SOFTLY) Do you know I've been... I've been hatin' you as long as... As long as I can remember, man. You're not the guy I've been hating. And I can't hate you anymore, man, because you're not... You're not who I thought you were. Howdy! Boyd, please, man. Save it for the judge, asshole! Ooh! You are a big fella. Jesus Christ in a car seat! Look, this has nothing to do with him, all right? This is you and me. I heard you come into some money. No, you heard wrong, man. I didn't come into any money. I was sittin' outside the bank. I saw you come out. Cut the shit. No, it's just... All I got was a guitar, man. That's it. He ain't lyin'. Shut up! How much? I swear, man, I got nothin'. Oh, you swear? Yes. Like you swore you was gonna pay me back? Like you swore you wasn't screwin' my wife? Just calm down, all right? Will you just calm down? I am calm! You see how calm I am? Now I am gonna calmly ask you one more time. Where's my money? Look, I don't have any money. I'm sorry, man. Too bad. (GUN COCKS) (YELLS) No! Augy! Augy! (GROANING) You hear that bass? Yeah. That's how you throw a punch. MAN: You guys okay? Call an ambulance! Thank you, man. For what? Hell, I ruined your life. No, man. What I wanted... What I wanted to tell you is, I forgive you. Okay? I forgive you. All right? You did it, didn't you? Did what? Cried. Like a baby. Look at you, gettin' all sentimental on me and shit. You know what I was thinkin'? I was thinking maybe, you know, when you're patched up and you're feelin' better that we could help Santa out a bit. You know, we kind of do some of the business stuff. You know, give him a break or somethin'. Yeah. Old fool, he needs one. Yeah. (COUGHING) We could have some Country-Western nights, you know? Yeah, as long as you get me big chicks. (CHUCKLES) I like some big chicks. I know you do. I know you do. I know you do. Come on, big guy, look at me, look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Augy, stay with me. Augy! Augy! No! Augy? Augy, look at me. Come on, man! (SIREN WAILING) (SLOW BLUES MUSIC PLAYING) (CROWD CHEERING) Don't know if you've ever had a friend who's taught you a lesson, but this friend taught me how to appreciate a sunset.
