WOMAN: Police say the body was found early this morning... ...by a wildlife photographer in a mangrove swamp off Key Biscayne. The victim's clothes were in disarray... ...and police believe she may have been the victim of an assault. This is possibly the third rape/murder in as many weeks. However, police are not willing to say the murders are connected. - Jane. - Thank you, Mona. Roger, in a situation like this... ...with the possibility of a mad killer roaming our city... ...even the slightest suspicion should be reported to the police. I couldn 't agree with you more, Jane. - Coming up next-- - Once again, Roger... ...I think it's important for the people... ...to demonstrate their concern over this situation. We 've got a psychopath running around out there. Every woman should report anything unusual... ...any odd encounter or situation. Yes, I couldn 't agree with you more, Jane. And coming up next on Newspoint is Dr. Bob and the weather. Bob, what've you got for us today? Well, all you ski fans, you're in luck today, it's snowing. [LAUGHS] Only 2000 miles away in Aspen, Colorado-- Quasimodo, that's enough. --Where they had three inches of.... You ' d better watch yourself going home tonight, Deb. Don't worry, Al.

I know you're not wearing a bra, Debbie. What? [MAN LAUGHlNG] Fucking creep. MAN [lN NORMAL VOlCE]: I'm gonna fuck you, Debbie. - Fuck you, bitch. Bitch. - God. [DlAL TONE HUMS] [PHONE RlNGlNG] MAN [lN SlNGSONG VOlCE]: I'm gonna kill you... ...Debbie. [MAN LAUGHlNG] McGUlRE: District four, Sergeant McGuire. Yes, uh.... I live alone, I keep getting these calls. [McGUlRE SlGHS] - Obscene calls? - Yeah. They were awful. Sick. - You've been watching the TV news, huh? - Huh? Well, you're the sixth complaint this evening. Since those murders started, every weirdo in town 's been jumping on the bandwagon. Everyone from boyfriends playing jokes to certified psychopaths. - Oh? - That's right. Those TV people don 't do us any favors. But this was for real. I didn ' t know his voice... ...yet he knew me. It was almost as if he could see me. Did he threaten you? Yes. Yes, he did. He kept saying things. Like I said, this sort of thing's been happening all night. If it'll make you feel better... ...I'll have someone come out tomorrow to take an official report. If it keeps happening, we 'll have a tap put on your phone, okay? Yeah. Yeah, sure. - Now, what's your name? - Ormsley, Debbie Ormsley. 1111 Marine Circle, off the beach. Apartment 104. Got it. You'll hear from us in the morning. - Have a good night. - Yeah. Yeah, thanks. [FLOORBOARD CREAKS] [KNOCKlNG ON DOOR] - Who is it? JEFF: It's me, Jeff. Jeff, thank God. [DEBBlE GASPS] What the hell are you doing? Have you gone totally nuts? Hey, this thing's only a joke. It was left in my cab. What the hell's going on around here? Some creep's been calling me all night. - Can I stay at your place? - Sure, baby. Oh, thanks, love. - I'll just be a sec, okay? - Yeah. Yeah. [GLASS SHATTERS] Can't leave you alone for a minute. What have you knocked over now? Jeff? Enough's enough. The joke's over. Now, listen. Jeff? [GASPS] [SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] [WHlMPERlNG] [DEBBlE YELLlNG] [GRUNTlNG] [GASPS] [GRUNTlNG] [LAUGHlNG] JANE: Oh, my God. - What's the matter? - The time. I didn't realize it was this late. You know, you could help me solve a big problem. What's that? I don't know what to do with the left side of my closets. There's plenty of space. And you can have it with an open-ended option... ...and no binding clauses. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take a postponement on that one, counselor. I think you're trying to influence the decision of the court. I can always serve you with a restraining order. Hey, I was just about to go into my final argument. Well, we're gonna have to discuss this later... ...because night court is adjourned. You know, I'm at the end of my probationary period. I thought we agreed there wasn't gonna be a time schedule. And we did. But I seem to recall we also agreed... ...that we'd talk about your sister. Not right now. All right. We can't keep putting it off forever. Do you have any idea... ...how long it's taken me just to establish a home for Tracy? I can't just change that on her. It wouldn't be fair for her or for us. Look, I'm not asking you to do that. You know how I feel about you. But that's not the point. She would be a burden to you. You would grow to resent her... ...and then you'd resent me. And then it would just be over for all of us. - How do you know? - I know. Believe me. I know. Good night. Damn. [TlRES SCREECH] MAN [ON RADlO]: And more disheartening news... ...the Labor Department reports that the National Unemployment Rate... ...has remained unchanged for the last four months. More world and national news coming up. Preliminary projections for next year's budget... ...show a probable 16-percent tax hike for homeowners in Broward County. Commissioner John Frankel says the increase has been brought on... ...by two main factors: One is the impact of inflation. The other is the lack of a cash surplus for the first time in three years. - WXXI All News Time is 8:42. - No, just go and eat. And turning to local news... ...police report the Miami Strangler has struck again. The bodies of Debbie Ormsley, a South Beach waitress... ...and an unidentified male companion... ...were found early this morning in her South Beach apartment. Dade County investigators are awaiting the coroner's report... - ...to fix the exact time of death. - Nothing. [DOORBELL RlNGS] - There' s somebody at the door. - Nice around south part of this morning. Eighty-six degrees in Miami, 82 at the beach. In West Dade at the Tamiami Airport, rather warm-- - I think someone wants you over there. - Right. - Let me tell her you ' re here. - No, wait. Can l? Well, sure. - Does David want some coffee? - Sure. You know, I'd really like to be able to talk with her. It's not something you can just learn overnight. You have to live with it. - No more excuses, remember? - Okay. Now, that wasn't so hard, was it? I really blew it at work yesterday. This rapist thing is really getting to me. Well, I think you're being way too hard on yourself. You've got to put the whole thing out of your mind. Why waste time on something you can't do anything about? - Where is she going with those bags? - To the laundry. - Tracy does the laundry? - Among other things. One, go to a CU on Jane. Police say the two had been dead for at least 12 hours. Ironically, the bodies were discovered by detectives following up a complaint... ...of obscene phone calls received last night. Although an autopsy is being performed at this time... ...by the Dade County medical examiner... ...a preliminary report indicates that the woman was sexually molested... ...then strangled to death with a belt found at the scene. Well, apparently metro police have assigned at least 15 detectives full-time to this case. They are expecting a break very shortly. We'll be-- Unfortunately, Roger, it's too late for one more victim. Uh-oh. There she goes again. I'm sure the police are doing everything they can. We'll be back after this. You okay? Oh, yeah. I'm fine. Come on, Tracy. Come on. Tracy, you stay here. Tracy, you stay here. [CAR HORN HONKlNG] JlMMY: Hello, management office. Jimmy here. Hi, Jimmy. I bumped into a car last night in the garage... ...and I don't think there was any damage but I wanted to leave a note just to be sure. It's space 23. Can you tell me whose that is? Anything you say, Ms. Harris. Let's have a look. Twenty-one, 22, 23.... That's Mr. Stanley Herbert, apartment 1204 over in the north tower. Hello? Ms. Harris? - 1204? - Yeah, 1204. You're almost neighbors. You should be able to see each other. [PHONE RlNGlNG] Hello. Rogers, Richardson and McGowan. I'm sorry, but everyone's gone home for the evening. Is there anyone there? Hello? [PHONE RlNGlNG] Hello? MAN [lN HlGH-PlTCHED VOlCE]: Is that you, Annette? [MAN LAUGHlNG] Look, why don't you stick it in your ear and then go jump in the bay? [LN NORMAL VOlCE] I'm gonna stick it in you, Annette. [PHONE RlNGlNG] [MUSlC BOX PLAYS OVER PHONE] MAN: This is our song, Annette. Why don't you leave me alone, will you? I'm not interested. I don't wanna hear it. [PHONE RlNGlNG] WOMAN: Hello? - Susan, I'm scared to death. - Somebody keeps calling me. - Annette? He knows my name, he knows where I work. Hey, hey, calm down. You okay? Look, I can't take much more of this creep. He's really getting to me. He plays music. Music? What kind of music? I don't know. It sounds like something out of a music box. - You call the cops? - No. I don't want any hassles. I just want to get out of here. He's driving me crazy. What are you up to? Are you alone tonight? - Yeah, like a good girl. - Well, do you mind if I come over? - Sure. Come on. - I'm on my way. [PHONE RlNGlNG] [SOBBlNG] [SCREAMlNG] [HORN HONKlNG] Herbert. Stanley Herbert. And he wasn't wearing a belt. Can you imagine a guy in a three-piece suit... ...and he wasn't wearing a belt? David, are you listening to me? - How does she do that? - What? Make that turn like that? Oh, it's like putting your shoes on without looking. That makes sense. Yeah. Well, a guy changing his clothes in the garage... ...before he goes up to his apartment doesn't. - Huh? Come on. Maybe this guy, Hubert-- - Herbert. All right. Maybe this guy, Herbert-- Well, maybe he's a married man... ...and maybe he's having an affair with another woman. Has that ever occurred to you? This is only hours after the police found that couple killed. And the girl was strangled with a belt. That is known as circumstantial evidence. Look, if the police went around arresting everybody who wasn't wearing a belt... ...they'd run out of space in no time. So, what else? His shirt. It had stains on it. - So maybe he's a slob. - David.... Look, if I were defending this guy, I could have him out of jail... ...before the judge ever banged his gavel. Look, don't worry about it. They'll catch this psycho, whoever he is. Guys like that always make a mistake, and when they do-- Now you're a psychologist. Look, I don't have to be one to see that you're torturing yourself. I made a promise to myself that I'd never let anything happen to Tracy again. No matter what I had to do. Well, before you start to take the law into your own hands... ...think for a minute. I mean, Tracy gets along just fine... ...your building is secure-- Come on. You can't be serious. Nobody's really safe. You know that. [MUSlC PLAYlNG ON CAR RADlO] What's the matter? That car over there. It's really getting to me. Forget about it. Damn. I can't take this guy all night. I'm going to go out and give him a push. Oh, all right, but make it fast. Yeah, okay. I'll be right back. Hey, man, I think you could use a push. You can come in now. DOCTOR: The test shows that the ocular nerves are normal... ...and there's no damage to the head. MOTHER: I don 't understand. What's wrong with her? DOCTOR: We have conclusive evidence that the brain has not been damaged. MOTHER: Oh, thank God. FATHER: Then why can 't she see or hear? DOCTOR: We're really not sure. MOTHER: It's my baby, doctor. You've got to do something. Tracy! [PHONE RlNGlNG] - Hello? ROGER: Jane, Roger here. I just came in and checked the news desk. There's been another one. - Oh. - I thought you 'd wanna know. - Oh, when? - Last night. A secretary on her way home from work. Grabbed right out of her car. They found her five miles away in a gravel pit, face down in the mud. There were two other murders nearby. JANE: Did you say that she was found in the mud? ROGER: Yeah. Why? JANE: Nothing, I'll see you later. WOMAN: Directory. Nancy, may I help you? - Yes. May I have the number for a Mr. Stanley Herbert, please? WOMAN: One moment. Stanley Herbert, H-E-R-B-E-R-T... ...822- 1076. [DlALlNG PHONE] - Good morning, Jimmy. - Oh, hello, Miss Harris. - Sit down, please. - Thank you. - Would you like a cafecito? - No, thank you. But the juice machine is jammed again. Can you help me out? No problem. [SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] - I'll open it up for you. - Oh, thank you. It's those damn kids again, they're always messing up that machine. [JlMMY SPEAKlNG lN SPANlSH] I'll be back with the juice just like that. Don't go away. Okay. It will only be a minute. [CUCKOO CLOCK CHlMES] [PHONE RlNGlNG] Ugh. Uh, excuse me. When you spoke with her, did she seem upset? She was upset, but I don 't think that she ever believed... ...that she was in any immediate danger. I mean, we all get calls like that at one time or another. Did she say anything else about the calls in particular? I don 't think so. Wait a moment... ...she did mention something. - She said it was kind of eerie. - What? There was some kind of music in the background, like... ...a music box or something like that. Stop it there. This is a crazy question, but can a cuckoo clock make music... ...or does it just go "cuckoo"? I don't know. I can't see why not. Why? Mm, no special reason. Let's take five, okay? NARRATOR [ON FlLM]: Tales of marital bliss. [SCREAMlNG ON-SCREEN] - Jane, you are 20 minutes late. - David, you won't believe it. David. NARRATOR: Tales of true love... ...and of intrigue. MAN [ON FlLM]: You take your part... ...while I will take everything that mankind wants to give me. - [WHlSPERlNG] David? - What? There's something I wanna show you. What is this? - It's his shoe. WOMAN: Shh! Sorry. Whose shoe? Stanley Herbert's. How did you get this? I took it from his apartment. You mean, you took this from his apartment? - Right. MAN: Shh. And, David, look how muddy it is. Oh, my God, Jane, are you nuts? PEOPLE: Shh! David. David, you needed more proof so I searched his apartment... ...Iooking for something and this is what I came up with. You must know somebody downtown who can compare... ...mud samples for you, to prove to you I'm right. - You expect me to take this to the police? - Yes. And just how do I explain your having it? Well, you'll think of something. Breaking and entering, burglary, and I'm supposed to explain it. Me, a criminal lawyer, explain this to the police. David. David, I need your help with this. Tracy's home alone most nights and she's not the only defenseless woman in this city. Well, has it ever occurred to you that your Mr. Herbert just may be innocent? No. You know, I can't believe you're doing this. Why can't you stop being an attorney long enough to let yourself trust me? Why don't you stop being a reporter long enough to see you're getting in too deep? You're gonna get yourself hurt. I got that shoe to convince you! The only thing I'm convinced of is that you've gone off the deep end. Hey, wait. Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that. David, you're usually very clear. Come on, what are you doing? Wait a minute. Jane. [PHONE RlNGlNG] Yes? Is anyone there? I know what you're doing... ...and I know it's you, Mr. Herbert. - Who is this? - Never mind. Let's talk about you, Mr. Phone-Freak. How does it feel to have the tables turned? I think you've got the wrong person. Oh? If that's so... ...how come you haven't hung up yet? [PHONE RlNGlNG] What's the matter, cat got your tongue? - What do you want? - I want you to turn yourself in. Look, I don't know what the hell you're talking about. Leave me alone. [PHONE RlNGlNG] Goddamn it, I've had enough of this crap! Stop calling me! Stop calling me! You don't understand, Mr. Herbert... ...it's not up to you to decide. [DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG OVER SPEAKERS] [SCREAMlNG] [GLASS SHATTERlNG] I was touched most by the victims' parents I talked to. I don 't think there's any way for me to convey the pain and sense of loss... ...they must bear. And not just until tomorrow's news overshadows... ...these tragedies, it's for the rest of their lives. This segment is at an end, but the story isn 't, and it won 't be... ...until this killer is apprehended. You, me, the authorities... ...all of us must work together. The effort has to be made... ...before this phone freak strikes again. Before another innocent woman falls prey. This is Jane Harris reporting. Back to you, Roger. That was a terrific report, Jane. Is there--? The effort has to be made before this phone freak strikes again. Before this phone freak strikes again. Before this phone freak-- This is Jane Harris reporting. This is Jane Harris reporting. It's beautiful outside! You don 't believe me? You just open up your window... ...and say, "It's beautiful!" We 're going to start this morning with the high tide. It starts at 6:04 in the morning, and 11 :30 p.m. at night. Now let's go to the weather, okay-- [PHONE RlNGlNG] JANE [ON RECORDlNG]: Hi, this is Jane Harris speaking.
