I remember those cheers. They still ring in my ears, and for years they remain in my thoughts, 'cause one night I took off my robe, and what did I do? I forgot to wear shorts. I recall every fall, every hook, every jab. The worst way a guy can get rid of his flab. As you know, my life wasn't fab. Though I'd much... Though I'd rather hear you cheer when you delve... No, no. Though I'd rather hear you cheer when I delve into Shakespeare. "A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse!" I haven't had a winner in six months. And though I'm no Olivier, I would much rather... And though I'm no Olivier, if he fought Sugar Ray, he would say that the thing ain't the ring, it's the play. So give me a stage where this bull here can rage, and though I can fight, I'd much rather recite. That's entertainment. That's entertainment. Jake La Motta and Jimmy Reeves in the Cleveland Arena. La Motta is undefeated, but he is well behind on points. The Bronx Bull has taken a lot of punishment in this round. Jake is cut around the left eye. Jack, tell me why? Why the fuck do we have to come to Cleveland for you to get beaten by a mulignane? Come on, Jack, do the fucking right thing here, will you? He's got you by the balls, Jake. You're out-pointed. You're coming up to your 10th. You're gonna have to knock him out. I want you to bite him, kick him, do anything you got to do. Nobody's looking. - You know what to do. - Listen to Joey. Listen to Joey. Just like home, all over the fucking mooli. Knock the motherfucker out. You understand? Knock him out. Hey, you want to go in there? You want to go in there and... Help! You need a knockout. Let's go get a knockout, - and that's where it's at. - Tenth and final round. Good luck to you both. La Motta fighting out of a half-crouch. Reeves is up against a tough fighter, a man who doesn't know how to back up. La Motta continues to bore in. La Motta out with a bob and a weave, hooks a left to the jaw and Reeves is down. The crowd is urging Jake on. The referee is toiling over Reeves. He tries to get up. La Motta comes at him once again. Reeves misses a right, takes a left and another left, a hard left to the jaw, and Reeves is down for the second time, and a determined Jake La Motta is making a great comeback here in the 10th round. Reeves is up again. La Motta comes at him with a left hook to the jaw, another left and a right to the body, three more lefts to the mid-section, a hook on the jaw, two more lefts to the head, a right and a left to the jaw by La Motta, and Reeves goes down for the third time, and the referee is pulling La Motta away. Two, three, - four, five, six, seven. - The referee is hunched over Reeves, - but time is running out. La Motta waits. - Eight, nine. And there is the bell. Reeves has been saved by the bell, but did La Motta do it soon enough? - Jack, Jack, come here. - It's no good. This is Ohio, not New York. You waited too long. Joey, put my robe on right. Put my robe on right. Ladies and gentlemen, under the rules of the Ohio Boxing Commission, after 10 rounds, the winner by a unanimous decision, Jimmy Reeves. The colorful Jake La Motta, the Bronx Bull, has lost his first fight. That's Jake's fight. Come on, that's Jake's fight! Jake won that fight! Don't leave. Don't get out of the fucking ring. Stay here. You won. Let him go first. Stay here, I'm telling you. La Motta floored Reeves seven times in the fight, but La Motta still lost. - Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! - Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! They pick up his arm, he's dead. They tell him he won the fight. People went crazy. That shit would've never happened if Tommy was over there taking care of him. I mean, you know he's gotta be with Tommy to fight in New York, to get a title shot. I mean, he's gonna wind up fucking punch-drunk, your brother. - I know. - You know. You gotta make him understand that it's the best thing for everybody involved. I said I know. You know, but you got to make him know. You got to tell him, make him understand it. Jesus Christ! You want to stop. When the fuck are you gonna stop with all that stuff? I told you, I understand everything. He just wants to do things for himself. That's all. Hard to understand? That's because he's got a head like concrete. You make me laugh. You think it's easy? Why don't you talk to him. - You know what to say. Tell him. - You know I can't talk to him. - And why can't you talk to him? - 'Cause he don't like me. Yeah, nobody likes you. You ought to be used to that. They know. They know who's the boss. The judges didn't know, who knows what happened with them? The people knew. You don't believe me, you thought I was over there fooling around, huh? You thought I was fooling around, didn't you? Tell me the truth. I ain't gonna fool around. That's in your mind. Yeah. So what? That championship belt on me, that's when I fool around. - Is it done? - No, it's not done. Don't overcook it. You overcook it, it's no good. It defeats its own purpose. What are you doing? I just said, don't overcook it. You're overcooking it. Bring it over. - You want your steak? - Bring it over. Bring it over! It's like a piece of charcoal! Bring it over here! You want your steak? - Yeah, right now! - Good! Good. Here's your stupid steak. - You can't wait for it to be done? Here. - No, I can't wait. Good. Okay. Happy? Happy? - That's all I want. That's all I want. - Here. No. More. There. - You bother me about a steak, huh? - That's great. - You bother me about a steak? - Yeah! I agree with you. He should be with Tommy. If he's in a good mood, I'll talk to him. What the fuck do you want me to do? But, Joey, Tommy tells me every day to talk to you to speak to Jake to straighten this thing out. I mean, I'm going to wind up in the middle of this thing. You're in the middle? I'm his brother. He's got me fucking nuts. You're his brother, if you can't talk to him, who's gonna talk to him? - I'll talk to him. - Do what you can, that's all. That's all I'm asking you. All right, I'll see you tomorrow. Let me go up. Where you gonna be? We'll be at the gym or the other joint. One of the two. - I'll catch you by the gym. - All right. - Sal. - Yeah? Go fuck yourself. Complain some more. I want to hear. I want to hear. I want to hear it. - You call those carrots? - That's right, they were carrots. - You call that food? - You ate them. - Did you eat them? - You call that food? I got no choice. I'm sick of you already. - I can't believe you. - I got no choice. - I got no choice. - You got no choice? Get away from me! - Please! No! - Get in there. Get in there. Get your hands off me! Get away from me! Fuck you. I'm sick of you. What's the matter with you up there, you animals? What? - Come on. - You animals. This son of a bitch just called me an animal. - Hey, you. - Come on, Jack. I'm gonna get a hold of that dog and I'm gonna eat him for lunch. You hear what I'm saying? You hear me, Larry? - Larry? - Crazy animal! Who's an animal? Your mother's an animal, you son of a bitch. You're gonna find your dog dead in the hallway tomorrow, you bum. Jake, I can't take it! The whole block, people could hear you. I'll kill the whole family. Sit down, relax. Be calm. You break anything in there, I'm gonna kill you. I swear to God, I'm gonna come in there and I'm gonna kill you. Yeah, sure. You want to calm down? What? What'd I do? Come on, honey. Let's be friends. - Truce, all right? - It's not all right! You can't. I'm telling you, you can't fucking eat and drink like an animal, put up with this fucking braciola. You can't do this. I'm telling you. Forget about the Reeves thing. You got a million other fights coming up. You just can't keep doing this. What's wrong? Something's the matter, I know. What's wrong? What's bothering me? My hands. Your hands? What about them? I got these small hands. I got a little girl's hands. I got them, too. What's the difference? You know what that means? No matter how big I get, no matter who I fight, no matter what I do, I ain't never gonna fight Joe Louis. Yeah, that's right. He's a heavyweight, you're a middleweight. We know that. I ain't ever gonna get a chance to fight the best there is. And you know something? I'm better than him. I ain't never gonna get a chance. You're asking me what's wrong. But you're crazy to even think about something like that. I mean, he's a fucking heavyweight, you're a middleweight. It's impossible, it'll never happen. So why go crazy thinking about it? It's not normal. Do me a favor. - Yeah, what? - I want you to hit me in the face. - What? - I want you to hit me in the face. Forget about it. Joey, I want you to hit me in the face. Go ahead. - Go ahead, take your best shot. - I said forget about it. I ain't doing it. Come on, we have fights all the time. What, are you worried now you're gonna hit me in the face? Hit me in the face. Go ahead. - No. - What, are you afraid? Afraid of what? Come on, don't be a little faggot. Come on, hit me. I ain't a faggot. Take your best shot, then. Come on, Jack, you gotta be a real jerk. - You want me to punch you in the face. - Hey, Joey, did I not tell you just to do it? Now, I'm telling you, you gotta do it. I ain't hitting you. Hey, I'm your older brother, Joey. I'm telling you something. I know what you said. I ain't doing it. I don't care if you get mad. I ain't doing it. Fucking nut. I'm not doing it. I don't have any gloves, anyway. What am I gonna hit you with, the table? - Use that over there. - What? That's right, use that. Wrap it around your hand. How many times I gotta tell you? - Not too many more. - Go ahead. - All right, go ahead. - You want me to hit you? I want you to hit me with everything you got. I want you to fucking lay me out. Go ahead. - You sure? All right. - Yeah, go ahead. - Harder. - Yeah? You throw a punch like you take it up the ass. Come on, harder. Harder. Harder. That's hard, you fuck. - What do you want? - Take it off. Take it off. Oh, come on, you want to stop now. - That's enough with that. - Take it off. - Come on. Come on. - Don't fuck around. A girl, huh? I'm gonna smack you again. Throw it again. - That's enough. - Go ahead. - I said that's enough. - Harder. Harder. No. Your fucking cuts are opening and everything. What are you trying to prove? What does it prove? Hey, Vito. Joey, what's what? Jake, you're looking good. How you doing? Joey, come here. He looks mad, huh? I spoke to him yesterday. I don't know. You told them to come up here? Answer me when I talk to you. Yeah, why? I can't have my friends up here? - I heard this fucker didn't win the fight. - Take it easy. Don't ever bring them up here again. You hear me? Come on. They look like two fags up there. Joey, we're gonna go. I'll call you tomorrow. Hey, Jake, watch you don't hurt yourself. How's your wife? ls everything okay? Listen, anybody bothers you, you let me know. Okay? Yeah. Wave. - They're your friends. - What the fuck is wrong with you? You gotta make a fucking jerk out of me. They only came up here 'cause Tommy told them to come up and try to help us. What's the matter with you? Help who? What's the matter with you? How are they gonna help me? What, by taking my money? Is that what you're talking about? Taking my money? I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again, you hear me? Come on, what are you, a jerk? I'm a jerk? You're a fucking asshole. What the fuck, you hit me? Yeah, yeah, you fucker, try this. Maybe you can't? Motherfuck. Hey, Mike, give me a Coke. Shove off. You're gonna go to the dance? Who's that girl? - Which one? The one I was talking to? - Yeah. - The blonde? - Yeah. Vickie. Where's she from? She's from the neighborhood. She's a neighborhood girl. - What's her last name? - Vickie, that's all I know. They call her Vickie. She knows them? She knows them. They know her. She comes to the pool every day, and everybody knows each other, you know how that shit works. She go with them? She don't go with nobody. She's 15 years old. Where the fuck's she gonna go? Where you gonna take her? Copacabana? I heard there was a girl that he went with, that was a very beautiful, young girl, blonde. That's not her? I doubt it very much. What are you thinking about anyway? She ain't the kind of girl you just fuck and forget about. Joey, how many times I gotta tell you, why you always cursing when I'm talking to you? Don't do it around me. Do it around your friends. It's a thing. Just don't do it to me, that's all. She's not the kind of girl you bang and forget about. She's not like that. You got to spend time with her, get involved, you know. - Did you bang her? - No. - Tell me the truth. - I just told you the truth. I tell you the truth the first time. You don't have to ask me again. I never do that. I always tell you the truth. If I didn't, you would know. I took her out a couple times. You went with her and you didn't try to fuck her? I try to fuck anything, you know that. - But she didn't go with it? - She didn't go for it. Naturally. She knew better. What do you mean, "She knew better"? She knew you were an animal. She knew it was no good to go with. Her whole reputation would be ruined. I thought he was talking to you, Vickie. - That's the same guy? - Yeah, it's the same guy. - I gotta break his legs. - He was over here yesterday. - He was here yesterday? - You missed him. I was up at the house yesterday, and he was over here. You stay in the neighborhood, you'll find him. No, I'll catch him. Friends, they're in a huddle. Big business meeting. They come by the pool, they sit around and talk. Big deals. They make sure she can hear. Like the big man. Get the fuck out of here. Don't get your hair wet. Big shot. I'll get him alone in a back room, smack him around, no more big shot without his gun. Real tough guys. They're all tough guys. What are you thinking about? Keep looking. Where the fuck you going? You're dead. You're married. You're a married man. It's all over. Leave the young girls for me. Big shot. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on, you gonna stay here all night? We'll never get... Where the hell do you think you're going at this hour? What are you? A cop? I'm going out. Business. You fucking worm. You go out, I'm going out. Hey, do what you're gonna do. What do I care? Run out! See if I care! I'm not gonna be here when you get back. You fucking bunch of guineas. You're always hanging out together. Why don't you just stop already? Why don't you fucking stop. You're not going on business. - You're going to suck each other off. - Why don't you have some respect? - The whole building hears you. - Suck him! Suck him, baby! Larry! Hey, Larry. Now you got something to talk about with that fucking dog and this one up here. Fucking juke. Why don't you hit her in the head with a bat, huh? Don't call her names. She's still my wife.

I don't know, but you can see from there at least. - Come on, let's go. - I don't want to look. - Hello, Joe. - How you doing? Thanks for the seats. Hey, what's up? Nothing. I got trouble with these two motherfucking greaseballs downstairs. They got me crazy. - Hello, Father, how you doing? - Hey, Father, what is it? Father, you want to get laid? You sure?

Yeah, must have gone shopping. Sit down. - Want something to eat? - No. You sure? Why don't you sit over here? Sit a little closer. You're so far away, like on the other side of the room. Tell you something. Come here. Come here. Sit over here. Come on. That's better. No. Thank you anyway. Here's your water. Want to see the rest of the place? All right. I bought it for my father. I bought the building. Yeah? - From fighting? - Yeah. What else? This is the dining room. And some bird. It was a bird. He's dead now, I think. Sit down. That's me and my brother. We're fooling around. I know. You look good, though. What are you smiling about? I don't know. You know how beautiful you are? Anybody ever tell you that before? Yeah, they tell you all the time.

They only gave him that fucking decision 'cause he's going in the Army next week. That's the only reason. I knocked him down. I don't know what else I gotta do? I don't know what I gotta do. I don't know what I gotta do. You won and they robbed you. They're miserable because their mothers take it up the fucking ass. That's why. I've done a lot of bad things, Joey. Maybe it's coming back to me. Who knows? I'm a jinx maybe. Who the hell knows? Okay. Forget about all that shit. This was your shot. They robbed us. They out and out robbed us! - Jake, it's Vickie. You want to talk to her? - No, I don't want to talk to nobody. - Joey, take her home. - All right. - Jack, you're going to be all right? - Yeah, I'll be all right. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Make sure she's all right. - All right. Don't ever do that Janiro bullshit again. No more deals like that. - You hear what I'm saying? - What are you talking about? - What am I talking about? - Look at that. 168 pounds. - Stop eating. - What's this with the smart-ass? I told you I didn't want to do it in the first place. Didn't I tell you that? No, you didn't say that. You're the one who told me you could get down to 155 pounds. Where'd I get it? What, did I pull it out of the fucking air? I don't know if I'm gonna make it down to 155. If I'm lucky, I make it to 160. And on top of that, you sign me for a fight at 155, and if I don't make the 155, I lose $15,000? - That's right. - You're supposed to be a manager. You're supposed to know what you're doing. - I did just what I wanted to do. - That's what I'm worried about. - You did exactly... - You want a title shot? - What are you talking about? - Do you want a title shot? What am I, at a circus over here? I ask him, he's got more sense about this. What are you doing? You've been killing yourself for three years now, right? There's nobody's left for you to fight. Everybody's afraid to fight you. Okay. Along comes this kid Janiro, he don't know any better. He's a young kid, up-and-coming. He'll fight anybody. Good. You fight him. Bust his hole. Tear him apart. Right? What are you worried about? What's the biggest thing you got to worry about? - The weight? - I'm worried about the weight. - You worried about the weight? - What are we arguing about for? I just said the weight. Okay, let's say you lose because of your weight, are they gonna think you're not as tough as you were? You're not the same fighter? Good. They'll match you with all those guys they were afraid of matching you with before. What happens? You'll kill them, and they gotta give you a title shot. Bring me coffee, please. Why? There's nobody else. Nobody's left. - Who they gonna give it to? - Coffee. - In a minute. - You listening to me? - Please, honey, bring me the coffee. - All right. How long I gotta wait? Are you listening? Now, let's say you win, you beat Janiro, which you definitely should beat him. - Right? Right? - Yeah. Yeah. They still got to give you a shot at the title. - You know why? - Why? 'Cause the same thing as before. There's nobody left. There ain't nobody around. They gotta give you the shot. You understand? If you win, you win. If you lose, you still win. There's no way you can lose, and you do it on your own, just the way you wanted to do, without any help from anybody. You understand? Just get down to 155 pounds, you fat bastard. You stop eating. What's the problem? Stop eating, that's all. You can do it. You don't understand anything. You understand that? You know, Joey's right. This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter. He's good-looking, he's popular, - you beat him now... - Excuse me, excuse me, what do you mean good-looking? I'm not saying good-looking, I'm saying popular. if you win... Who are you to say about good-looking and popular? I'm not saying anything. I'm just telling you Joey's right. - What are you? An authority or what? - Nothing. Get out of here. Take the baby and get out of here. Everybody, all of a sudden, is an authority about this. Where did she find out he's good-looking, first of all? She didn't mean nothing. Who asked you? You gonna start with me now? When people are talking, you don't interrupt. It's none of your business, especially if it's my brother and his wife. They got nothing to do with you. Now get out of here. Go inside. Get in and take the baby inside. Come on, let's leave the grouches here, okay? - Come on. - Change her diapers. Can't you see? She's gonna... Look, she's gonna cry. She stinks. - You make her cry. - I'm gonna make you cry. Yeah. They're a couple of babies. 155 pounds. Let's go to the training camp. No distractions, no wives, no phone calls, nobody around to bother you. All right? Your usual schedule, your usual diet... Joey, Joey, listen, I want to ask you something. When I'm away, you ever notice anything funny going on with her? - With who? Vickie? - Yeah. - Like what? - What do you think I mean? No, I don't notice anything. I want you to keep an eye on her. All right? For what, Jack? She don't do anything wrong. I want you to keep an eye on her while I'm away. All right? You'll just start trouble for nothing. I'm telling you, you're cracking up. Hey, Joey, I got a reason, all right? You and I both know any woman, given the right time, the right place, the right circumstances, they'll do anything, right? - I mean, anything's possible. All right? - Yeah. - Well, you're right. - Yeah, you know? You're not wrong, but you're picking on this girl. 'Cause I saw you before, you're worried about your weight, you're getting aggravated, you tell her... What do you... "Go inside, go inside. "Who asked you, who asked you?" Bothering her for that, you're gonna give her an excuse to go out. - She was talking about a guy. - So? So what? She was talking on your behalf. On my behalf? She was talking about a pretty kid. She's saying he's good-looking. What are you talking about? So you make him ugly. What's the difference? - Never mind, never mind, just do it. - All right. You know what you should do? Go inside and be nice to her. Make up with her. Tell her you're gonna take her out. We'll go out. You want to go out before you go away, don't you? This way you go away with a clear head. You know you took her out, you wined and dined and had a good time. - All right? - All right. - Where do you want to go? - Out out, you know. - All right. - All right. Listen, though, don't... If you tell her now, pull her on the side. Don't say nothing in front of Lenore. 'Cause I'm not taking her. - It's on your head. - All right. What, you think I'm gonna go tell her? - Do what you gotta do. - I am. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It's great to be back at the Copa lounge. What a great audience. Come on, lady, laugh it up. I laughed when you came in. But seriously speaking, folks, we have a special guest with us tonight. I'd like to introduce the world's leading middleweight contender, the Bronx Bull, the Raging Bull, let's hear it for the great Jake La Motta, ladies and gentlemen. - What's your name again? - Janet. Janet, sorry. I've just been... It's toast time. He hits me with a left hook. No hand, just a hook he had. - Where are you going? - Going to the bathroom. - Hey, Vickie. - Hi. - You're looking great. Joey here? - Thanks. Yeah, they're over there. Jake's here, too. That's great. Listen, I'm over here with Tommy and some of the old gang. You get a chance, come over and have a drink. It's a nice night. - Hello, Jake, how are you? - Hello. You're not drinking, are you? - Joey, how are you? - How you doing, Sal? - Look like you're having a ball over there. - Yeah. Listen, I'm over there with Tommy Como. Why don't you come over and have a drink? Tommy's here. I didn't even see him come in. I'll see you later, Joey. Man, that's some suit. He looks good, huh, Jack? I thought that was my best joke. Vito, look who's here. - Hi, Vickie. - Hi, Vickie. Hey, Vickie. How are you, honey? Good to see you. Say hello to John. Come on, sit down. Have a drink. I can't, I have to get back to Jake. I just came by to say hello. All right, honey, thanks for coming by. Not a bad kid that Vickie, you know. She's with that fucking gorilla. Must've caught a hundred beatings off that guy. What took you so long? - I went by Tommy's table to say hello. - I saw you say hello to him. What took you so long? Nothing. I said hello. I came back. - What else did he say? - He asked me if I wanted a drink, I said, "No, Jake and Joey are over there," and I left. What were you talking to Sal before? He asked me if Joey was here. I said, "He's over there." He said, "Tommy's over there. Why don't you go say hello?" And I did. Are you interested in him? No. Why would I be interested in him? - You sure you're not interested in him? - Yeah. In other words, you're not interested in him but you could be interested in somebody? Jake, don't start, huh? You're still mad about some stupid incident? Shut up, or I'm gonna smack you in the face. These are from Mr. Como. Shall I take this? - What? - Shall I take this? - I'm not through with it. - Okay. These are the jokes, folks. I'll tell you the truth. Hi. How are you? Bald-headed fag. Hey, Joey. Tommy, thanks for the drinks. - How are you, Joey? - How are you? - Where's Jake? - He's over there. He don't wanna come. - Call him. if you call him, he'll come. - All right. - All right, I'll be right back. - Here he comes. What is it? You don't call anybody anymore. We never see you anymore, for crying out loud. Yeah, you never come around anymore. You can't even make a call? What is it? I'm busy. I'm going away fighting. I'm busy. - I'm out of town a lot. - Busy. Busy. Busy. Look at him, taking me seriously. I'm only kidding you. What a fucking kid. That's the best fucking fighter around. - Jake. - How you doing? The mulignanes, forget about it, - they're all afraid to fight you. - Okay. - How you feeling? All right? - I'm all right. Good? Strong? Strong. Yeah, I'm doing okay. That Janiro's got to watch his ass, right? I think he should. Last three, four times, I won nothing but money with the guy. Well, he's no piece of cake. That's a good fighter. Very attractive guy, all the girls like him. No marks. Clean. Jake, am I wrong or did you gain a few pounds? Yeah, a few pounds. I'll knock it off right away. No problem. Right off, right off. Well, look, let me ask you something. I'm just talking, now, just talking. I come to you and I'm telling you that I'm gonna bet a lot of money on you - in this fight with Janiro, right? - Yeah. What would you tell me? What could you say to me? I would say bet everything you got. - Everything? - Everything. 'Cause I'm going to open his hole like this. Excuse my French, girls. I'm gonna make him suffer. I'm gonna make his mother wish she never had him. - There something personal? - Make him look like dog meat. - What? - Did he say something in the papers? No, he's a nice kid. He's a pretty kid, too. I mean, I don't know, I got a problem with if I should I fuck him or fight him? Crazy. Fuck him or fight him. You're really liable to get fucked with this kid. Watch out. - By who? - Janiro. You mean, you want me to get him to fuck you? - Me? No, I don't want him to fuck me. - Yeah. - I could do that easily. - How you gonna do that? 'Cause I get you both in the ring, and I'll give you both a fucking beating, and you both can fuck each other. - I'll get all full of blood. - You're used to that. Come on, drink up. That's ginger ale, Jake. Come on. - Jake, good luck. - Good luck, Jake. Hey, Vick. Vickie. - What? - You awake? No. Can you hear me? What? You ever think of anybody else when we're in bed? - What do you mean? - You know, like, when we make love. Nobody. I love you. How come you said that thing about Janiro? What did I say? You said he had a pretty face. I never noticed his face. Well, how come you said that, then? I don't even know what I said. I don't even know what he looks like. Go to sleep. He ain't pretty no more. And the winner by unanimous decision, in 10 rounds, Jake La Motta. Give me a little piece of ice, just a sliver, just for my tongue. No water. Come on, I'm dying. Fucking hard-on. Four pounds. Keep working. Cut the bullshit. Joey, I saw him fight with Janiro, I couldn't believe it. He destroyed this guy. It was absolutely incredible. He
