Zohar Laskov, Mark Rosenbaum and Itai Tamir present: Dorit Bar Or, Yael Poliakov Evelyn Kaplun Yuval Segal, Eyal Rosales Meir Suisa Moshe Folkenflick, Uri Klausner Amir Bosheri, Raumonde Abukasis SHE'S GOT IT Irena. - Why the rush? - We're late for work! This is the last time I go walking with you. This is not for me. Wait, I feel sick. I'm out of air. Dizzy. Wait a second. What about the guy? Got a date? He asked me out tomorrow. Good for you! Don't smoke now. - Leave me alone. Well, tell me. I don't know if he's right for me. One's short, another dumb or ugly. You'll end up alone. He's too perfect, he's... - Not one of ours? So he's Russian, eh? - Russian? - No. You're making up bullshit. Malka? Malka. They probably want to talk to us about the... overtime for the new line. I told you it would be fine. Malka, come here. Sit down. As workers' union chief you must know the factory's been in trouble lately. We're doing our best to make it through this rough patch. What are you saying? Unfortunately, all our measures and economizing have failed, we must take some drastic steps. What about the loan you got? - Barely covered expenses. You're closing the factory? - We have no other choice. Are you closing it? Did I say that? No way! Last week the Defense Ministry cancelled its trousers order. We are left just with the shirts. Malka, you're staying with us, but... What's this? - We must fire some of the workers. You want me to give them notice? Do it yourselves, bastards! We're being had, don't let them lay you off, this is just the beginning! Friends, please calm down. The owners and myself are making every effort to get the factory back to normal working order. Rivka, Sarah, Olga, don't go back to work! Sit down! What have you done with your loan? You go away. You've got work. Sure... Let go of her! What are you doing? Get off me! I'm doing everything to get things back to normal. I'm going to Jerusalem today... - I'm warning you! I'm warning you for the last time! Let go! What did you do with that loan? Malka... - Thieves! - Malka! Leave her alone! Let him go! Let him go. Now he's a criminal, too? Not until you apologize to my wife. You've really lost it. - Right! Okay. I apologize to your wife. - To her, not to me. Malka, I apologize. - Now I'm calm. Shlomo? The fax is here from Eilat with the casino data. - Shhh... Yafit! What's so special about this money? Everybody has to know we get 4 million shekels from the casino? I haven't smoked for 2 weeks now. Awesome! - It's good for you. Pull over at the gas station. I'm hungry. You know we are not allowed. On me. One day we'll be caught. Stop whining. I'm hungry. Pull into the station. Rosales, anything for you? - Tuna sandwich, no onion. Drink? - I've got coffee. I'm off to the men's room, order the tuna with lots of onion. Stop it, Kobi! - Onion's healthy. Watch the car, I'll be right back. Weitzman? - Yes? - The 200 note looks like shit. I know, I'm working on it, relax. Hurry, Brazil's waiting for us. Shlomo. You smell so good today! New perfume. That's a very nice blouse, too. It... flatters your neck. Rosales! - Listen, inside the bank don't forget to ask the cute teller for her phone number. Yafit? I promised and I'll do it. How do you know her name? Top-stop secret. Rosales! How do you know her name? Think I'd miss the cutest teller? How many times do I have to tell you? No onion! I told you. - Why? Onion's good for you. Get the bags out, go on. I'm in the car. This is a robbery, hand over all the pens you have. Red, is that okay? My favorite color. Thanks for your cooperation. You call this security seals? That's the way to deposit? Now you're checking seals and bag material? What's with you? - You'll wait until I'm done. So what do you say? When do I pick you up? I'll get to Beer Sheva on my own. My place? No, by the restaurant. As you wish. We're going "Dutch". - No way. Next time mind the seals! - Alright. Mom! - Yes, sweetie? Guess what I got on my math exam? - 80. More. - Uh... 90. - More. What, 95? - 98. - Wow! Give me a kiss, sweetheart. What gift will you give me? Shall I get you some warm milk and honey? I owe you a gift. - 3 gifts. - Why 3? Because I also got 100 in science and 90 in history. Come here! Haim? There's meatballs with rice and beans, want some? Haim. Sweetheart, we'll be fine, you'll see. Fine? Where am I going to find work now? A man with brains and hands and never-mind-what-else like yours will surely find something. I'm not in the mood for this. Appetite comes with the eating. What appetite? I was fired. Forget your troubles for a minute or two. A minute or two? An hour or two. I can't. I want to ask you something. - For you, anything. I want us to go get the rabbi's blessing. Some advice. Do it for me, honey. No harm, no help. No help, no harm. Anything you say. Haim... Haim... - Malka... Haim! - Malka! Haim... - I can't, Malka. You can. - I can't. Haim... - I can't, Malka. Esther, please get me lottery tickets for 200. You promised Irena you'd stop, didn't you? - One last time. One ticket. - Yes. One pack for 200. Two hundred! What's up, Pinhas? Everything okay? - Thank God. This note looks fake. You've been had. - No! - Yes. Motherfuckers! Beer Sheva. What shits, eh? The manager stays on the payroll. How's Haim? Everything will be alright, honey. I don't know what's ahead. Haim's depressed. - Oh no! Go to the rabbi. Say some prayers, it'll work out. You know I don't believe in that stuff. What have you got to lose? Everything will be fine. Weitzman. - Yes? Have you seen my watch? - No. No? - No, I haven't. - I can't find it. Tuck her in. - Yes. What's this? Bought it with watch money? - What are you talking about? Where's watch? What did you do with watch? With the watch! The watch! I want to understand, you wasted all our money, and now you're back to card games? Shut the fuck up! I didn't take your bloody watch! I'm sick of their shouting. Poor Irena. Don't you ever raise your hand on me! I'm your husband, how can you do this to me? Irena, let me go! Only if you calm down. - I'm calm! Swear it! I swear. No, Weitzman! - Let's see you now. - No, no. This was my grandma's gift. Is everything okay, Irena? - Sure, everything's fine. Nothing's fine. Good night, Malka. Watch out! Sorry. Thanks. What shall we drink to? - To the good life. The very good life! Great wine! What vintage is it? 2008. - A very good year. Next year will be much better. Here is your Beef Stroganoff. - Nothing like Beef Stroganoff. Everything alright? - Oh! Sorry. - It's alright. Enjoy your meal. - Thanks. Gave you the eye, this waitress. I like you. Very much. What? Mom, you can't call here every 10 minutes! She'll get here. Wait, Mom, I think she's here. Just a moment. Yes, it's her. I can't open this. Mom, wait. I think they're going to kiss, wait. I had a lovely evening. Me too. Good night. Good night. No, he didn't kiss her. There, she's coming upstairs. I'll send her home right away. Enough, leave her alone. Hello? Hello, Weitzman. - Hi, Kobi. Hello, Weitzman. - Hi, Kobi. Fuck off! - What's that? - Not you. Come down, I brought you something. Wait, I'm coming. What are you doing? - Just teasing, can't you take a joke? Come on. I brought you a sample bag. We need 8 of these. I'll tell her to make 10. - But without knowing why. Why worry? She's my wife. Cool off. Even the KGB could force nothing out of her. Did you get me the certificate? Even the police chief won't notice it's a fake. - Hold. Looks like the real thing. Good work. What about Yafit? - Cooking. It was amazing. I didn't think I'd have such fun. Did you do it? - I don't like it when you ask such questions. So you didn't. - First date! It's serious, eh? Have a seat. Haim son of Moshe Ohayon and Malka daughter of Mordechai? - Yes. Any children? - 2 daughters. Never mind. The sons will follow, God willing. What school do they attend? - Public school. Why are you answering for me? - Who's answering for you? The little one's in pre-school. - Why not send them to us, Rabbi, please, we came for a different reason. We came for a totally different reason. - Malka. Shh, let's hear your wife. Since my husband Haim was fired, he's depressed... He won't get out of bed, doesn't wash. - Alright. Go back home, open the prayer book and read: "Who can find a woman of valor, her price far beyond pearls, "her husband's heart in her does trust, and needs no spoils." No spoils? - So it is written: "God-fearing is the wife." You go along with your husband Jacko... Haim. - Yes. Haim. You go along with him, support him and everything will work out. - "And needs no spoils." Yes. Now here's a date, for a blessing... We're out of dates. Never mind. Tonight, before you go to bed, eat this apple together and read this blessing. Everything will work out. God willing. Again? - What? - What are you doing? - What? Are you screwed up? - Who is? - Enough! You'll read the blessing and, God willing, everything will work out. Amen! - How will it work out? You and your husband Jacko will go back to work. What work? They're closing down the plant. - Malka! Watch your mouth! Excuse me, Rabbi. God willing, the plant will thrive again and be saved. Amen! "Her husband's heart in her does trust, and needs no spoils." "And needs no spoils." He's got time for jokes, eh? Did you bring the samples? Come on. Malka, you're not going in. Please, don't go in there! Is this how you look out for us, joking around with the guys? You can't just barge in here like that. Irena! Show him the samples. Look. Look how lovely. What is this? - Look at this work. - What is it? - Children's fashion. Children's fashion? - Yes, why not? We are not the shareholders. Give them 5 million and they'll be glad to sell the plant. Why didn't you invest the loan properly? Right, why didn't you? - I'll see what I can do. Believe me. Maybe in the meantime we'll find a solution for Haim. Forget about the meantime. - Part time job, in the storehouse. Are you threatening me? Let's go, Irena. You can still keep the car. Look what you did to me. Look what you did to me. At least I apologize. Sure! - I really do, honey. You know I love you. I can't move an inch without you. I'm a dickhead. I know I am, we mustn't fight any more. You've said that 100 times. - This is the last time. You'll see, I'll get you out of this hole. I'll do anything for you. Anything. Weitzman, it's best we part ways. - Baby... Without you I'm half a man, you know that. But you won't change. I've got the queen of deals. A safe plan. No risk. - You'll get in trouble. I'll make you a princess. You'll live like a queen. Anastasia or Katrina? Who? Who? Weitzman, you're dreaming. Haim, are you asleep? No. I talked to the manager. Why didn't you tell me? - He wanted to take you back to work. Great, the Rabbi's blessing works. - What? Part time in the storehouse. I have no choice. I'll take it. I told him no way! You told him what? He wants to butter me up so I won't get in their way. How do you decide such a thing on your own? He wants us to sit tight like chickens, and then the knife will fall on us all. - What do I care? Have you become a union leader on my back? Honey... - What? I want you to do something for me. I need you to sew me 10 bags, just like this. But don't let anyone see you. What for? You ask too many questions. Weitzman! - Trust me for once. As long as I don't know what it's for, I'm not sewing a thing! Good morning. No seeds. Why didn't you tell me you're a cop? You must keep secret what I'm about to tell you. Even if four thugs from the casino show up and threaten to chop off my legs, I won't talk. I'm a police undercover agent. I'm posted to this Secure Delivery to check your bank. You know? I had a weird feeling. I wondered how a guy like you... - Money from the casino to the bank is illegal cash. Shlomo, the manager, is he involved? We don't know to what extent. I knew it! I told my sister, "Something stinks here!" I'll tell her. I've got to... - You promised me something. Just kidding. I can help. - I won't involve you in this. I'll risk it. - No way. These are very dangerous people. What do I do? - I told you, no way. Are you sure? I'm sure. Yes? - Good morning, Kobi. Everything's fine. We've got all sorts: 50, 100, and 200 notes. Look. Look. What's this? - Weitzman asked me to sew 10 of these. What is it? Looks like... - Like what? Like... a bag for cash deliveries. One night a guy came over on a motorcycle, Weitzman went down and they were thick as thieves. What kind of motorcycle? Big? - Yes. Black? - Yes. What day was that? Monday night. Oh my God. What people my sister's been hanging out with! My husband is getting us into trouble and you go on about your sister? Something's fishy about this guy, got to check this. Got to ask Weitzman. Is he at the press? - Yes. Okay. Irena, let's go. Sunday's the day. What's with you? Cute, that teller, isn't she? - Yafit? Sure, she's cute. I don't feel like getting her into trouble. - Have you lost it? That's Kobi's motorcycle! In Brazil such a sum will do fine. Bundles. - What? Weitzman is printing banknotes by the millions. Millions! God forbid! I'll open a printing press, Irena will have her own fashion line... Did you tell Irena about our plan? - Are you kidding? I'll tell her at the right time. If their plan works, you'll be going with Yafit and Kobi to Brazil. Brazil? - Yes. Stand here. - Why now? - I want to see. What for? - I want to have a look! Why take your wife and girls to Brazil? Brazil is full of ass like you won't believe! Dark-skinned, walking around topless. Dancing the Samba all day. I love Samba! - Nothing like Samba! Dancing Samba topless? So what do you say, Kobi? - What are they doing? Dancing the Samba. - What? - Samba. We'll go to Brazil solo? Just you and me? - Weitzman. What? - Too close. What is it? - Nothing. Cats probably. Relax, I tell you it's just cats. Better start learning the Samba. - No, they're going alone. Alone? - Weitzman and Yafit's boyfriend. What, he'll leave you and the girls? What a bastard! Leaving me to the casino sharks. Why did you marry him in the first place? He was such a... He looked like Antonio Banderas. A bit. And I was alone with my daughter. What? - Sure, Antonio Banderas! Center, you copy? - I copy. Got her home number? - Yes. There's a little problem, she's gay. Just kidding. Here you are. This is her number at the bank, and the fax. I prefer her home number. Better not call her at work. You're right. Better not call at all. Know what? Put on the whole act, warm her up. Send her flowers, poems, play with her. I should write her poems? - Not you. All the great poets. Send them anonymously. - Anonymously? - Yes. Warm her up. I love poetry. Great. 2-3 weeks of anonymous poetry mails, you call and introduce yourself. "Hello, Yafit? It's Ofer Ventura. "You don't know me but I know you" Right? - Nice! "Black gold adorns your brow, I don't recall it ever being sung..." No signature. Who sent you this fax? I didn't know we had secrets. I get 2 faxes every day. Morning and afternoon. Yes? - Yafit, what's up? The day hardly goes by. If Kobi didn't send me faxes with poems, I'd go out of my mind. - I need to talk to you urgently. About what? - Not on the phone. Come over tonight. I'll tell you what he's planning: To take casino money and escape abroad. Leave you and Irena to the sharks. What sharks are you talking about? Those who send money to the bank every week. What is this bullshit? Malka! You can't stand the idea I got someone like Kobi! I can't? What did he ask you to do for him? It's a secret. I can't tell you. - You're getting in trouble. You don't know anything. Nothing! What don't we know? He's a police undercover agent and I'm helping him. What undercover?! Maybe KGB? - Yafit, make up your mind. Is he your boyfriend or police operator? Sometimes it goes together. - Not in this case. He and Weitzman plan to rob casino money. And run off to Brazil. The two of them. Alone. I'm going to Beer Sheva. I want to hear this from Kobi myself! - Beer Sheva, now?! Wait! She doesn't have a license. Irena, come! Yafit! You can't start it... Let me take you. It's a factory car, you have no insurance. I'll drive you. Get out! Irena, come along. What are you doing? I'm going to the police with the whole story! What will you say? "Kobi cheated on me with the waitress?" You don't deserve this love, go away, leave me alone. I would have done anything for him. Anything! My days pain away, my heart aches so, go away, leave me alone. Leave me to my fate. Oh God, answer my prayer, when will this pain end? Like a frozen bird I am, helpless, wounded my pride, help me, God. I loved him so much! Some more coffee? Cookies? Go ahead. Yes? - The CEO says he's sorry, he can't make it. How can you do this to me? - Who is it? Yes. I understand. - What do you understand? Next week. - No! Hello! This is the workers' union chief. Tell your superiors we want... Hello? She hung up on me, that bitch! Malka. What happened? - Sonia called, trucks are removing the sewing machines. - Haim, call... Where's Haim? Get dressed, I'm coming. Haim, get up. They're closing down the plant. Come on. Mustn't give in. They're removing the sewing machines. Forget it, honey. Those shits always get their way, no matter what. - Enough! You're letting me go there on my own? Bread and work! Bread and work! Bread and work! Bread and work! Bread and work! Irena, come on! Dvorah, what happened? They've loaded all the machines on the truck. - Where? Move over! Let me in for a second. - No. I need a moment to talk... Halfon, you bastard! Today it's me, tomorrow it's you. Bread and work! Bread and work! Halfon, resign! Resign! This time you're finished! Haim! Haim! What? - Come quick, they're beating up Malka. Halfon, resign! Let go of me! Halfon, resign! Malka! Haim! Let go! Bread and work! Bread and work! Officer! Officer, I need a cigarette! Officer! - Who is that, Dadon? Dadon, get me a cigarette! That's it. Our story's over. Mustn't give in, Malka. When I get out of here I'll go to the police and tell them everything. Everything! Then they'll slam Weitzman in jail, too. I have an idea. I have a better idea: We'll take the Rabbi's advice. - What was that? "Who can find a woman of valor, "her husband's heart in her does trust, and needs no spoils." We'll get up in the morning, as they say, and get the "spoils". The prayer book says "in the night", not "in the morning". Morning, night, who cares? If we don't help ourselves, no one will. Yafit, you've got to play along with Kobi, so he doesn't suspect you. Got it? Irena. You'll sew the bags just like Weitzman asked. - What? Sew the bags just like Weitzman asked you. - Okay. So we'll have the "spoils" to ourselves? Tomorrow morning you'll be released. What's this shit? I smoke Kent. - That's all there is. It's against the law. - Irena! If you'd shave, at least, dress up. Had I known we'd meet, I'd shave for you. You've got to pull yourself together. Show some consideration, I'm unemployed. My God, Haim, what have they done to you? - Broke my leg. Honey, what did they do? - See that? Got you cigarettes, honey. - Thanks. Where'd you get money for bail? - Weitzman. - Weitzman?! Dirty pigs, what have they done!? Come, honey. It's happening next week. As soon as the fax comes in from the casino, you send it to us. What do you need the list for? To follow its route. If they pass the money on to some fictive company and use it illegally, it needs evidence in court. Yes. You're acting weird. Did you think I do such things every day? No, it's not that. Is everything OK? - Yes. Nothing like Pina Colada. We need to get the bank manager away from the bank. Take him out somewhere. Are you crazy? I won't have him touch me! If he so much as touches you! What will I say? "No, I'm just teasing?" No. Stall him. Make him a drink. Mix these in. Two of these will do, he'll fall fast asleep. - No, I don't like it. You can change your mind. - No, I'm not. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. Looks like real money. Malka? Malka? - Just a minute. I'm coming. Malka? - Wait a minute. Here you are. - Thanks. Malka. - What? I can feel you're not telling me something. Haim, remember what the Rabbi said about "a woman of valor"? "Her husband in her does trust, and needs no spoils." Remember? I understand the first part. What was that second part, "Needs no spoils"? I'll tell you everything in due time. Not now. Malka! - What? I don't know what you're scheming but I don't agree. What do you think will happen? Should I get in my PJ's, lie in bed all day, watch TV all night? Tell me, what? We're through here. Don't you see? No work, no living! If we don't get up and do something... We'll be pushed around all our lives, moved from one place to another. Malka, what's your plan? First say you agree. I can't agree before I know. - Say you agree. Promise you'll agree. - Tell me first. - Agree! Enough, tell me! Haim doesn't agree. - What? So what do we do now? Malka, talk to me. Malka. Okay. I agree. On one condition: That I'm in on it. If anything goes wrong, I take full blame. Sweetheart. At 2 o'clock you come with the armoured car and I'll get in the dumpster at 1:30. Where did you park your pickup? - At the other end of the gas station. The other end of the gas station is here. - Hallelujah! We park the car with its back to the dumpster. - Okay. I'm talking to you. Look at me. Me and Ventura get out and walk to the diner. Switch bags, back to the dumpster. See us go and then you go. - Okay. This is the key to the back of the car. Don't mind if Rosales is there, he'll be in dreamland. What's funny? This is the key to my apartment. You wait for me there with the money till I get back. - Yes, sir. Weitzman, I'm not kidding. - Yes, sir. They're gone. Let's go. How can they switch the money? Kobi told me to fax the list of banknotes to Weitzman I see. - They'll get the fax, put the banknotes in the bags you made and deposit them in the bank. By the time the bank figures out the scam, they'll be in Brazil. Which gas station did they mean? - The one with Zmira's diner. We have to find a way to put our hands on the money. Kobi gave me pills for Shlomo. - What pills? - Sleeping pills. Show me. We'll give them to Weitzman. And take the money? - Right. Malka. - What a nut! You smell nice today. It's my new aftershave. It's right for you. Makes you... so... Yafit, I can't stop thinking about you. I... I don't want to hurt anyone. My feelings... - Monday noon. Why not a weekend in Eilat? - Let's take it step by step. Monday, lunch break. - Monday's tight here, you know... Well, some other time. - No way. Monday is fine. Where? At my sister's, Malka. Why at your sister's? - They'll be gone, the house is empty. Monday. - But, honey-cone... What's so urgent, Shlomo? Yes. - Remember you told me about that pill? - Go on. The blue one. - Go on. - What, "go on"? I'm not a horse. If you were a horse, you wouldn't ask about that pill. Have you got it on you? Here are two. Believe me, it works. She'll be following your dick. Shlomo, watch it with those guys from Eilat! Everything's legal, Mordechai. Yes, I heard about them. - Thanks. Rosales, What time is it? 8:10. - Open the gate. 5.5 million! God does exist. Hello? - I faxed them. - What? I faxed them. - Oh. Irena, let's do it. Where's the stuff? Where did you put everything? Who is that? Me! Irena? - Yes. What are you doing here? - Brought you something to eat. What is it? - Kebbab. Here you are. Where's a clean glass? - In the kitchen. Thanks. Welcome. I've got to go, honey. - Eat, then go. They're waiting for me in Beer Sheva. Where's Ana? - With Malka. Great Kebbab. Avi's? - Yes. What? - What, what? Middle of the day? One drink. Want one? - Are you kidding? I have to go. Cheers? Cheers, my sweetest dear. Pineapple? I'll finish my Kebbab and run. - So run. What happened? Are you okay? Weitzman. Got to go. - Where? - I'm late. - Where? Kobi will kill me. - Who? What? - Who? Got to go. - Where? Where are you off to? - Got to go. Are you alright? - You lock up. Lock up after me, okay? - Okay. Didn't you give him those pills? - I gave him 3. He's ruining our whole plan. That guy's a horse. Look at him! You're smoking again! - Not really. You've got to let me make the deposit today. You're not making any deposit. I've got to talk to her. - No way. I'll take the risk of being fired. Didn't you hear me? You're not going in there. End of story. Why the nerves? - Who's nervous? Know what? You go ahead, make the deposit. - Really!? Thanks. Oops. Ran right into each other! Shlomo, no... Have a drink? - I had one at the bank. - So... I'll get us a drink. - Oops! Your ass jumped into my hand. Yes. - Half a minute! - We're ready. Cheers! Listen, Shlomo, I... I'm sorry, I can't do this in such a hurry. Now you tell me? You can't leave me like this. Yafit, I... I know it's love. We've got something so strong between us, such a bond, it's psychic. - But I... - What an ass you've got! Shlomo. Please... Just a minute. Here we are! Girls. Homework. - But it's time for Light Corner! First homework, then TV. - But it's on! So hurry up! - Into the closet. The closet! Get in! Quick! Haim. Didn't you go? Where's Malka? Malka is stuck. Don't ask what a mess, I had to get back with the girls, but she's coming. Call your mother to come sit for the girls. Are you crazy? That's not the plan! I can't leave Malka there. Got to help her if anything goes wrong. I'm calling Malka. See if it's alright. Call your mother now, or I'm leaving you with him. Look at him. Look at him, look at him wobbling. God! - I told you he's a horse. Crashed. - What? - He's asleep. Let's go. Watch it. Now I'm going in. Give me the bag. Girls, I'm going to sleep. Don't bother grandma. Tal, honey, I'm resting and reading a magazine. If I fall asleep, don't forget to wake me up at 4 o'clock. Irenuchka... What is this, what's going on? - Haim? I found the key! Did he touch you? - Do me a favor, not now. Did he touch you? - Sweetheart, cut it out. Enough. It's heavy, come on. Take this. Everything will be okay... Everything will be okay... Did he touch you? - What? - Did Weitzman touch you? Haim. Do me a favor. Just go away. - You're not alone in this! Sweetheart, you're getting in my way. Go away! You can hardly move! Haim. Irena, come here. Take two. Let's go. Irena, come on. Malka? I'm leaving Weitzman one bag. He doesn't deserve it. 10 years together. There were some good times, too. Malka, honey... Whatever. I know exactly what we'll do with the money. - Patience! We'll start small, so no one will suspect anything. We'll do a children's line with your models, Irena. With this money we can open 10 factories! One, Haim. I'll be fine with just one. God willing, in 6 months all the girls will be working. I feel bad about Weitzman. Forget about him. There's nothing you can do, Irena. In a year we'll be swamped with orders. Men will be buzzing around you and you won't have a moment. You'll really have your pick. What was that? Haim? A flat tire, I think. - No! It's a flat tire! Shit! Me and my luck! Okay, wait. I'll get the jack. Yes. - Mom? - Yes. - Keep him there until 4:15. Have fun. For some reason Shlomo isn't here. So who accepts the deposit? - Meital, Shlomo isn't here. Get this deposit. No, I can't do that. Put it in the safe till he gets here. - Why so nervous? - Who's nervous? Let's go, Ventura. Hello, I'm Ventura. - How do you do, I'm Yafit. Do you like Halfi's poems? - What? Who is it? "Black gold adorns your brow." - Oh. I thought it was... Come on, Ventura. I mailed it, anonymously. - "Adorns your brow", eh? So it was you. I've been wanting to talk to you for ages, to introduce myself. I hope you don't think I was crude. I just had to try, or else I could never forgive myself. Leave me your number. Who knows. I'll be really glad if you call if there's any change. You can never know. See you. See you. Hard, honey. - Haim. The handle, see? It's ruined. - Okay, try. No, it's crooked, it's fucked up. I can't turn it. That policewoman again! Irena, come on. Sudri, what's up? - Are you alright? Yes. No, we're stuck here with a flat tire. Not serious. What's that? - What? Nothing. The jack. - You want to change a tire with that? What's wrong? - I'll help you. It's alright. It's... Sarit, get our jack. Never mind, it's okay. - Get the jack. We don't need it. - Enough! What's up, Haim? - God be praised. Weitzman? Weitzman! Enough with your games! Weitzman! Answer me, shithead! Weitzman! - Mr. Kobi? Who's that? - We wanted to talk to you. What about? - The casino money. There's a bit of problema. We thank you to wait at home, yes? We come to talk to you. What the f... Where's the money? This is the real... What's going on here? Shlomo? - It's not what you think... The jack's not stable on the rock. Thanks for teaching me how to change a tire! If it weren't for you, I really wouldn't know what to do. You are unbelievable! She's coming. What's that? What have you got back here? Clothes that I make. Can I take a look? Show her. Let me try this on. - Take it, try it on at home. Got anything else? - What do you think this is, a boutique? What is that? What's in all those bags back there? Secret models. Open the door, I want to take a look. - No way! Is this a search? Step aside, please. I want to see. - I won't! Step aside! - I'm not moving. I'm not... moving! You're finished. I'm arresting you! What's going on here? Put that gun down, Sarit! Sudri, something stinks here! - Why are you rummaging? And without a warrant? How can you search without a warrant? What is this? - There's something suspicious here, can't you see? Put that gun away, right now! Get in the car with me. Now! - Okay. Sorry, girls. What is this? The car's moving, Sudri! Sudri, stop the car! The car's moving, look! Get the car, Sudri! Oh, my God... Never mind, shitty car. - What'll we do, Malka? I can't believe it! Please. - Thanks. Are you waiting for anyone? - For a girl. Does she know you're waiting? - No, it's a surprise. She's a teller at the bank. They close in a few minutes. What's her name? Yafit. It's after midnight, The moon has not yet... Malka. - What? - Weitzman! Where? - Here he is. Really! Shit, why doesn't he stop? He's a horse, I told you. Anybody needs a ride home? Anybody know you? Come on, Irena. Wait for me, Malka. - Come on, Irena. Don't touch that! It's my bag. Haim, come on. Irena, help him. Weitzman, I forgive you. Get up, Haim. It's okay. Dancing the Samba with topless girls, eh? Honey, what we've got back here is enough for us all. My "woman of valor"! You know why you're lucky? Because I love you. Irena, stop it. Weitzman. Bye. Bye, thanks. - Goodbye. Dadon, did you get the fire fighters? - Yes. Well, what takes them so long? Why search without a warrant? Why do you...
