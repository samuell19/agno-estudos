Welcome to sunny California. - Might as well pack your bags, you're going back to college. - Dad, just, just hear me out. Dad, I'm not, I'm not going back to Texas. I'm staying here. I've got a job. - Doing what, picking fruit? Washing dishes? - I'm the opening act for The Back Porch Majority. - A what? - Well, they're like a farm team for The New Christy Minstrels. Dad, just come, come hear me. - You want me to go to some beatnik club with ya? - Unless you're afraid of beatnik's, dad. - I want to introduce a young man, a great new talent, his name is John Denver. - Denver? - Hello, hello. Thank you all for showing up tonight. The first song I would like to do is a song I've written called, This Old Guitar. ♪ This old guitar taught me to sing a love song ♪ ♪ It showed me how to laugh and how to cry ♪ ♪ It introduced me to some friends of mine ♪ ♪ And brightened up some days ♪ It helped me make it through some lonely nights ♪ ♪ Oh, what a friend to have on a cold and lonely night ♪ ♪ This old guitar gave me my lovely lady ♪ ♪ It opened up her eyes and ears to me ♪ ♪ It brought us close together ♪ And I guess it broke her heart ♪ Dad? Dad? Dad, listen, huh? I'm real sorry about the name thing. - You want to throw away a college education, that's fine, that's your business. But when you throw away the name that you came into the world with-- - I'm not throwing it away. It's just that Deutschendorf won't even fit on a record label. Look, Dad. Lots of famous people start out with different names. - Famous? Let me give you some advice, son. Famous is not such a big deal. Howdy Doody is famous. - This is my dream, dad. It has been ever since I was a little kid. - Well, you're not a little kid anymore. Little kids dream about being famous, but a man... A man wants to be respected. A man wants to stand for something. Now when you think things through, you get on a bus and come on back home. We'll be glad to see ya.

(sighs) - So you wanna be the next Chad Mitchell, huh? - I've flown all the way in from Los Angeles for this. - Is this your first audition? - No, try about a hundred and first. - All right guys, let's try that one more time, all right? - I'm sorry about that part, Mr. Okun, I was a little bit flat there and I guess I'm just not use to singing in a studio. - It's all right, John. Don't be nervous. Just sing out, get with the blend. - Okay, Mr. Okun. - It's Milt. - Milt. - [Man] Thanks, David. You guys are great. - [John] I blew the audition, Frank. - Why don't you jam with Cosby and me? - No, nah, not in the mood. - You didn't really want to join the Mitchell train, did ya? They're way too wholesome. (scoffs) - Too wholesome? - Well yeah, if you want people to take you seriously, you've got to be dark and brooding, man. Like Dylan. - Well thanks, Frank. I'll keep that in mind.

That's all right. - John, hey John, listen, man. Listen, bud, it's time to go. - No, it's okay. I'll catch up with you all later, okay? Take care. Hi. - Hi. - So-- - Hey. Hey John, here ya go. This is for you. - Okay, thank you, thank you. _ So hey, how about one more song? - Well, no, I-- - Come on. - It's late and I have got to get up-- - One more song. If you don't sing a song, I'm gonna have to start singing a song and nobody wants that, you know what I mean? Yeah. Hey, turn the stereo off. John is gonna sing us another song. (applause) Yeah.

Expenses keep piling up, fellas. The debts only gonna get bigger. - [Mike] So what happens now? - Well, we have 10 more bookings. One or two open dates after that, then... Well, that's it. Fold our tent. - Just like that? - Look, we've had a good run with the trio. Now it's time to look for other opportunities. (scoffs) - Yeah, well, when this tour is over, I think I'll look for my opportunity someplace other than the music business. - Yeah. - [Joe] Let's go pack. - [Mike] Well, at least we've got a few gigs left. - [Hal] Chin up, guys. - Hal, if I told you that I wanted to go out on my own, would you help me? Would you still be my business manager? - Well, you know, I think the world of you, John, but well... I'm not gonna lie to ya. It's hard to sustain a solo career without a record deal. - But what about Milt? Could he help me get a contract? - Milt's a great producer. But you can't count on anything right now. I mean, by this time next year, the whole folk thing may be dead. Even Dylan's gone electric, John. - I'm just asking for somebody to believe in me. - I believe in you, John. Count me in. - And Hal, that $44,000. I'm gonna pay it back. - Excuse me? - Well, I want people to know that, well that they can trust me. What? - Well, John, I think I'm just witnessing one of these once in a lifetime moments. A musician demanding to pay his debts back. (raps on glass) - And Hal, those open dates, do you think we can get back to Minnesota? - [Female Student] Hey, Annie. - Hi. Hi, I'm John... Denver. We had a talk after, well after that concert a few months back. - A talk? - Uh, yes, yes, I said hi and... You said hi back. That's kinda like a talk, right? (chuckles) I got your address from one of the guys at the frat house. And listen, we're playing again tonight, over in St. Cloud and I was just wondering if you'd like to come hear us? - St. Cloud, that's a hundred miles away. - Well, I know, I've just come from there. It didn't take all that long. 82 minutes to be exact. (laughs) - You drove a hundred miles to ask me out? You could've called. Um, I have a psych test tomorrow. (gentle piano music) And, I have a curfew. - Oh. - And I don't even know you. - Well, that's three good reasons not to come. Are there any others? - I have to change. (gentle piano music) The last time I heard you sing that song, I didn't realize that you wrote it. - Yeah, the last time I sang that song, I seem to remember you walked out. - I had to get back to the dorm for curfew. (laughs) - You follow the rules, huh? - I suppose. - Yeah, so do I. - I thought musicians weren't supposed to follow the rules. - Oh well we're not, we're supposed to be dark and brooding but, (chuckles), I guess it's just not in me. My dad's in the Air Force. He's one of the best pilots in the country. - You must be proud of him. - Sure I am. - I bet he's proud of you. - Hey, come here. (Annie laughs) Come on. - [Annie] What are you doing? - [John] Come on. Come on. (grunts) Look at this. Wow. When I was growing up, we had a place like this where I used to go and just get away from it all. I'd just look up at the sky and I'd dream. When I was there, I felt like I could do anything. I even convinced myself to run away from home once, there. Did you ever run away from home? - It never occurred to me. - Never? - No, why would it? Home was everything, I loved my home. - Mitchell Trio's breaking up. - No. - Yeah, the guys, they're getting out of the business. But Annie, I'm going to try and get a solo career. - Well, you better. I mean, you have a gift. People tonight, they couldn't take their eyes off of you. - I couldn't take my eyes off of you. (gentle piano music) When I met you, I wanted to ask you to dance. - I would've said yes. (laughs) (slow romantic music) - I'm going to be traveling a lot. Maybe you can come and see me again. - Where? - I don't know, we'll see. Somewhere, would ya? - Yeah, maybe. (slow romantic music) Probably. (applause) - [MC] Once again, ladies and gentleman, let's hear it for Bill and Cathy Dannon and the Back City Band. (applause) - [John] Annie. - Do your hands always tremble like that? - You're here. - Mm hmm. - [MC] Now let's give a nice warm welcome for a young new talent, John Denver. (applause) - Thank you very much. Thanks. Thanks folks. It's lot better than where I usually stay. Most of the time when I play in colleges, they just put me up in somebody's dorm room. How was the, how was the bus ride? - Long. - Well, I'll make it up to ya. - You don't have to make it up to me. The way your voice filled that room tonight, it was amazing. (sighs) - I still need to get a record contract. - But you will, you will. I know you will. - The first time I saw you... I just wanted to sing for you. You were so beautiful and familiar. - Familiar? - Yes, like I had known you all my life. Like I was gonna know you all my life. I can't explain it, I just... I looked at you and the feeling that I had was... There she is. (slow romantic music) - Isn't it almost Spring break for you? - [Annie] Yeah. - [John] Well then you could come and see me again. You could come on tour with me. - I already have plans for Spring break. I'm going to Aspen with the ski club. - Well, what if you meet somebody there? (Annie laughs) - I don't wanna meet somebody. - Hey, what do you say we get married? (Annie laughs) - What do you say we have breakfast first? (thunder rolls) I don't wanna leave you. - I'm gonna marry you, Annie. - Stop saying that, just don't say crazy things to me right now. - No, it's not crazy. It's not. It's like, when I'm writing a song, I hear a phrase, I hear a piece of music in my head, you can't just let that drift away. That's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about writing a song, Annie. I'm talking about writing a song with you. - No. - Why not? (Annie sighs) - Because I hardly know you and... It's just, it's a dumb idea. It's a beautiful, dumb idea. (gentle romantic music) (thunder rolls) - Not raw enough? Well what does that mean? - It means you're not the Rolling Stones. It means you're not Jimi Hendrix. It means you're you, John. - Well, Hal, I'm not going to change who I am because some record executive-- - John, I'm not saying that you should, I'm just saying not to put all your hopes on a record contract now. (sighs) - But without a record deal, I'm nothing. - It's been a month now, this Annie thing eating you up. Why don't you do something about it? - I asked her to marry me, Hal. She said no. - So what? No is nothing, John. No is just a word that people use when they're not quite sure they wanna say yes. If you're gonna be a success, you gotta learn how to make 'em sure. (gentle guitar music) ♪ Lady, my sweet lady ♪ I just can't believe it's true ♪ ♪ And it's like I've never ♪ Ever loved before ♪ Close your eyes and rest your weary mind ♪ ♪ I wish that you could know ♪ How much I love you ♪ Lady, are you happy ♪ Do you feel the way I do - You know that beautiful, dumb idea? - [Annie] John? - It's not so dumb. People get married all the time. Look, I know that I don't have much now, just a guitar and a beat up old car and a bunch of songs that I haven't even written yet but, Annie, I love you. - I love you too, but... We're so different. - No, no, we're not. - But we are. You're used to moving around, I'm not. I need a home. How can we be sure we want the same things? - Because we want each other. At least, I know that I want you. - I want you, too. (laughs) ♪ Lady, my sweet lady ♪ I'm as close as I can be ♪ And I swear to you ♪ Our time has just begun (glass clinking) - I um, I would just like to propose a toast to the bride and groom and to wish them happiness. John, you found yourself a wonderful girl who seems to have hr head on straight. And I'm sure that she will be a big part of your success in whatever field you finally choose. (background chatter) - [John] I wish that just once, my dad could say that he was proud of me. You know, and if he doesn't say it on my wedding day-- - [Annie] I'm proud of you. (laughs) - Columbia said no. I didn't want to tell ya before the wedding. - Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I know that's a disappointment. But there are other record labels. - Yeah, 16 of them have already turned me down, Annie. RCA's about the only one that Milt hasn't tried. And I mean, why would they take me when everybody else has already passed? - Well, you can still go out and play music for people. - Yeah, but being on the road is expensive and I don't know how much longer we can afford to do it. - I'll get a job. - No, what about school? - I'll finish school eventually. - No, no, Annie. - Yes, it'll be fine. We'll make it work.

I'm really glad the store can live without ya for a few days. - Me too. - You know, someday, we're gonna be buying baby clothes. - And would you like that? Cause I would. I really would. Cause it's hard not to think about it, you know? All day I'm just staring at those cute little onesies and rompers and pajamas with teddy bears on them. - You would look so cute in teddy bear pajamas. (laughs) I'm going to definitely want a soundcheck. Is that on a dimmer? - I'll take care of it. - Ya, see I need a chance to go over my song list. - Honey, this is so exciting. - It's a start. - [Stagehand] It's for you, Mr. Denver. - Oh. Thank you. Hello. Hey, Milt. Well, what did they say? You're kidding? Yes, I'm still breathing. I think. - John, what is it? - Yeah, Milt. Thanks a lot, bye. - [Annie] What? What? - RCA just gave me a four album contract. $20,000. (Annie yells) Woodstock. Wow, look at that. That would've been so far out to play before a crowd like that. Wow, Crosby's there, of course. I guess, I don't know. Maybe if my albums had sold then, I don't know. - Hmm, it'll happen. You still have another album to go on your contract, so let's just relax and have a popsicle. - How can you be so sure? - Because I'm always right. So let's just forget about Woodstock. - Ah. - Is that something new? - Oh yeah, I was just jammin' with Bill and Taffy last week after the show. It's a little something I've been working on. - Sing it for me. - Oh no, no, no, it's still too rough and, there are a couple of changes I can't get and the lyrics, I haven't figured them out yet, so-- - Sing it. - Well, okay. ♪ Almost heaven ♪ West Virginia ♪ Blur Ridge Mountains ♪ Shenandoah River ♪ Life is old there ♪ Older than the trees ♪ Younger than the mountains ♪ Growing like a breeze ♪ Country roads ♪ Take me home ♪ To the place ♪ I belong ♪ West Virginia ♪ Mountain mama ♪ Take me home ♪ Country roads ♪ All my memories gather round her ♪ ♪ Miner's lady ♪ Stranger to blue water ♪ Dark and dusty ♪ Painted on the sky ♪ Misty taste of moonshine ♪ Teardrops in my eyes ♪ Country roads ♪ Take me home ♪ To the place ♪ Where I belong ♪ West Virginia Great show everybody.

Give yourself a break. (crowd chatters) - Thank you. Thank you. Hey. There ya go. (crowd chatter) Hey, - Hey. - There ya are. I was looking for you. Mm, so sorry things gout out of hand out there. - Don't be sorry. It's the goal isn't it, to make all those people love you? Isn't that what we've both been working for? It's just, kinda weird. Suddenly to be sharing you with thousands of people. - You're not sharing me with anybody. You got me all to yourself. Hey, let's go somewhere. Just the two of us. - Where? - I don't know.

You know, our fertility doctor. He's already done all the tests he can do on me. - Sure, I'll call him tomorrow. - Mm. (phone rings) (sighs) - Hello. Hey, Hal. How's it goin'? Oh yeah, we're, it's a, we're settlin' in here, it's comin' along. Yeah so, what's goin' on? Far out. Well, yeah, yeah. Listen, hey, count me in. Okay, I'll talk to ya soon then. Bye. (chuckles) - Is Hal going to come over and see the house? - Uh, no, um actually, Hal just spoke with the network. It seems they want me to put together another TV special. So we've gotta scoot off to LA. - But who's gonna unpack all the boxes? - Well, there'll be time for that when we get back, Annie. This is gonna be fun. (sighs) - Maybe we should put Doris Day in the scene. - That's a good idea, Mr. Crumb. Oh, well we wanna end the chicken skit with him laying an egg. - Come on, Daniel. Watch the cords. Come on, guys. - [John] All right, Susan. Thank you very much. - We got the (mumbles) notes on the rehearsal. Yeah, they're a little worried that you're saying far out too much. - Mm hmm, all right. - You said it during the opening sketch and once again to Kermit the Frog and after Doris Day sang, so that's three times in one show, okay? - Okay. (chuckles) Okay. Hal, do I say far out too much? - No comment. - Hey, Annie? - Yeah? - Listen, do I say far out too much? - Hmm, yes. (John growls playfully) (Annie squeals) John. (laughs) What? - God comes down to earth, okay? And everywhere he looks, he sees war and pollution and people being unkind to each other. And he's got to find somebody he trusts. Somebody to speak for him. So he... So he picks me. It's a movie, Annie. They want me to be in a movie. - Really? - Yeah, and guess who plays God. George Burns. Is not that not far out? - That's great. - I start working with the director the week after next. - But... You have an appointment with Dr. Danzer the week after next. - I don't think I can make it. - John, we're talking about an hour. Don't tell me you can't make it. We're supposed to be starting a family. I thought that's what you wanted. - Well, yeas, but I have obligations. Annie, it's not like the old days. - No, it's worse than the old days. You're moving at a thousand different directions, it's just... Not how I thought it would be. - Well, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to stop playing my music? - No, no, I'm not saying that. It just seems like lately, all that matters to you is listening to all those people applaud. - Well, well that's not fair. - Fair? You're off on tour. You're making TV specials. You're making movies. What about us? - Okay, I will make an appointment with a doctor, all right? But Annie, first I'm gonna fulfill my obligations, okay? I'm gonna do the movie. And I'm gonna take my band to Europe. Now, it would make me very happy if you would come with me. - I'm not gonna do that. Not this time. - Fine, then you stay in Aspen.

You're right, I, I really want to. (sighs) You know, I've got all this money and success. But I want to give something back, Hal. You know, I don't know, maybe we can create an environmental think tank. - A think tank? - Yeah, you know, we could fly people here to Aspen, you know, real experts like... Like Bucky Fuller or David Brower or... Maybe even Jacque Cousteau. Oh, you know, it's like my father always said, you gotta stand for somethin'. I mean, look at this, Hal. This is my inspiration. I want to stand for this. I want to stand for that eagle. - [Hal] Well, John, you know I'll support you in any way that I can. - [John] Wow. It's so far out to soar above it all like that. (sighs) Hal. You wanna take flying lessons with me? (laughs) - I thought we were talking about taking it easy, John. (applause) - [Male Attendee] There he is. A movie star. - Hi. There you are. - Oh, I'm so proud of you. - Oh, thanks, ma. - Oh, I'm having such a wonderful time. I met George Burns. - Yeah. (laughs) Hey, where's dad? - He's at the bar. - Go ahead, go on. - Excuse me. - Hey, there he is, man of the hour. Give me another one of these. That was a good movie, son. And you were just fine in it. There you go, congratulations. - Thank you. What's going on, dad? - Nothing. - Come on, dad, something, something's bothering you. - Oh. Some of my superiors thought that we ought to cut back on training for the new pilots and want me to go along with it. I told them that if they cut back, they'd have a bunch of dead pilots on their hands. Anyhow, the talk got a little hot, and I told them they can go to hell, and walked away. - You what? - I quit. - Dad, the Air Force, I mean, that's your life. - Forget about it, son. Come on, let's go back to the party. - No, listen, I don't have to go back to my party. I want to talk about this. - Some other time, okay? - Dad, there is not gonna be another time, and you know it. You have never talked to me, you never have. You act like you're embarrassed by me or something. - What are you talking about, overreacting. - Dad, listen, there is this guy in Aspen, now, he does these workshops, he could really help you get in touch with your inner self. - Oh, come on, son. You buy that mystical hippie garbage? - Yes, dad, I do. The world is changing right under your feet. - Ah, let it. (sighs) - Dad. No, he's never treated me the way a father should treat his son. You know, he doesn't respect me. - He does, he just doesn't know how to show it. - No, if he did, he would just level with me. You know, he'd take me aside, and we would go out and we'd have a few beers or something, I don't know, and we'd talk about things. We've never done that. So, everything between us is a lie. - You really believe that? - I do. I mean, look, Annie, if you care about someone, if you love someone, you don't hold yourself apart from them. - You hold yourself apart from me all the time. - What? Wait a minute, what is that supposed to mean? - Can you get this. (sighs) John, I've been hearing things about you. About when you were gone. - What things? (melancholy piano music) (sighs) I'm sorry, Annie, I'm so sorry. You know, I suppose I was upset with you. You know, you weren't there for me, and there I was night after night in front of thousands and thousands of people, and all of them are cheering for me, and... I was lonely, and I guess I didn't know it, until after the show one night, this woman-- - I'm going home. - [John] Annie, you can't go home, it's after midnight. Let's talk about this. - No. I'm with your father on this one, let's not talk. ♪ You fill up my senses ♪ Like a night in a forest ♪ Like the mountains in springtime ♪ ♪ Like a walk in the rain ♪ Like a storm in the desert ♪ Like a sleepy blue ocean ♪ You fill up my senses ♪ Come fill me again ♪ Come let me love you ♪ Let me give my life to you ♪ Let me drown in your laughter ♪ ♪ Let me die in your arms ♪ Let me lay down beside you ♪ Let me always be with you ♪ Come let me love you ♪ Come love me again (soft piano music) - That's our baby. - Oh, hi, little Zach. - He's beautiful. We didn't care what sex or race, we just wanted our baby to be strongest enough to live with us up in the mountains. Still can't believe it. You know, sometimes I wake up at night, and I go down into his room and I look at him, just convince myself I haven't dreamed all this. It's an incredible thing, isn't it? - What? - being a father. What do you think? - About what? - Our new jet. - What do you mean, your new jet? - Ah, well, I've been thinking about it for quite a while now, and I ran the numbers, and we decided it makes economic sense for me to have my own jet. (unconvinced laughing) - Well, she's a beauty. A lot of power in these things. A lot of maneuverability. - You want to teach me to fly it, dad? (laughing) - John, you don't just start off flying a lear, you have to have a pilot's license. - I do. - You do? (jet engine roaring) You're flying it now. You want me to take it? - No, sir, I got it. (chuckles) - [Dutch] Relax, you did just fine. - I did. - Yeah, you did. You got a natural feel for the lear. That kind of thing's hard to teach. - Well, you know what, dad? You are pretty good at this. - Hell yes, I'm good at it. Who else you think could have taught you this fast? This is my stage we're on now, this is where I play my music. Watch pitch. - You want to come work for me, dad? - Work for you? - Well, yeah. Listen, I can fly this plane sometimes, but I'm gonna need a good pilot, someone I can trust. And you gotta admit, she sure is fun to fly. Come on, what do you say? - Well, all right, but if you think I'm calling you boss, you're out of your mind. - No, I think Mr. Denver will do just fine. (laughs) (soft guitar music) And when Zoe woke up the next morning, she saw that her pancake was on her plate just like always. And then she knew she was really back home. The end. - Okay, time for bed. - No, read it again, daddy. - Okay. Where did it go? - It's behind you. - All right, it's bedtime. - No, no, oh, hey, that's not fair. It's two against one. - It's bedtime. - Okay, come on, let's go. All aboard the bedtime express. Here we go, hold on here. (imitates horn) Here we go. (imitatrd horn) (laughs) Choo choo. (phone rings) Hello. Hey, Jacques. It's Jacques Cousteau. - [Annie] All right, come on. - Hey. Well, yeah. (speaking foreign language) yourself, Jacques. Listen, I've almost finished a song. I'm thinking about calling it Calypso. Isn't that far out? Well, far out? How do you say far out in French, Annie? Did you read this? - Yeah, I read it. - Denver's modeling wonderment. The risk free reverence for nature, he repeats ad nauseum in song after song. His naive adoption of every trendy cause are all on abundant display in his vapid new album. I don't get it, I don't. You know how many people I played for in that arena in Tokyo? 18,000. I mean, you wouldn't believe how big I am over there. And then I come home to my own country and they're starting to make me feel like a has been. - Oh, you'll never be a has been, you know that. Hey, come here. I want to show you something. - You got a new bed? - Yeah, isn't it beautiful? I always wanted a headboard like this. It reminded me of my grandmother's. There's this furniture maker down in Aspen. You don't like it. - No, it's just, I mean, I thought we were gonna pick out a bed together. - And when were we supposed to do that? You were in Asia for three months. - Right, I'm sorry. - And then you just had to make a quick trip to the Soviet Union. - Okay, I'm sorry. (sighs) Mattress feels comfortable. I'm sorry. Come here. I have to go to Africa. Oh a fact-finding mission for the hunger project. - When? - Next week. - I would have said no, but, but Annie, it's the president himself who suggested we start getting involved. There are so many starving children over there, I feel like I have to go. - Well, how can I object when you put it like that? I mean, it would be pretty selfish of me to want my husband at home if children are gonna die. So, you just go ahead. - Hey, I'll make it up to you. - Don't worry about me. I'm used to it, but Zach and Anna Kate, you're never gonna get this time back with them. I mean, they're not gonna be young enough to ride around on your back forever. - I'll be back in three weeks. - And then in three days, you're gonna be off again to China or someplace, singing about life in the rocky mountains, but you don't really want to live this life, do you? It's just something for you to sing about. (melancholy music) - [Anna] Please, daddy, don't go. - Oh, sweetheart, I have to go. Come here. I love you. - I love you too. (engine turns and revs) (gentle instrumental music) - The problem is, these tree roots are busting up your main line. Might be able to reroute the pipes, but there's no guarantee. I mean, it's pretty solid ground around here, right? Might be a few weeks without plumbing. - So, what are you saying, we have to cut down the trees? - Well, it's up to you, but that's what I'd recommend if you want to solve the problem. - I'll have to think about it. - Sure, sure thing. Just let me know. - Thanks. - You know, my wife and I are both big fans of your husband. You know what song we had them play when we got married? Annie's Song. - Really? - Yeah, it's a very special song to us. - It seems to be a very special song to a lot of people. Tell you what, go ahead, cut down the trees. - Yes, ma'am. (sighs) - All right, Dutch, good job. Hey. - How was the trip? - Well, it was very rewarding. It's tough though, to see all those kids. hey, look, you think we could maybe push that recording session a week or two, give me a chance to unwind here? What, something wrong? - RCA dropped you, John. - What? - It's true. - I've made millions and millions of dollars for that company. Greatest Hits is the best selling album in the history of RCA. - It's not about that, John. Look, these new guys in charge, they think anybody they didn't sign up themselves is a dinosaur. What can I tell you, they're idiots. - I got all these new songs, Hal. Hal, I have been writing better than I have ever written before. I gotta get them out there. - Milt's looking at some smaller labels. - Smaller labels? - John, let's get in the car, okay? We'll worry about this tomorrow. - The roots were destroying the pipes. Something had to be done, I had to make a decision. I'm sorry I didn't consult you, but you were in Africa, or was it Australia or Asia. - Annie, I love these trees, that's the whole reason we built right here. And you knew that I loved these trees, and that is the reason you chopped them down. - Oh, that is such classic projection. - Classic projection, well, I'm glad to see you're keeping up with your studies. - Don't belittle the one thing I've done for myself. (sighs) - RCA dropped me. - What? They dropped you, why? - Because I don't have big fancy production numbers. That's just not who I am. Because I'm not Michael Jackson. Because I'm John Denver. - Honey, I'm sorry. Just... Come in the house. - [Dutch] You're a good pilot, John. You make the airplane do what you want it to. I heard about that RCA thing. (sighs) You ask me, they're a bunch of sons of bitches. Wouldn't know real talent if it crawled up their leg and bit them on the butt. Hell, they don't deserve somebody like you anyway. - Somebody like me? - Yeah, you know, a heavyweight. Do you remember that time when you were back in high school, you took the car and ran off to Los Angeles? (laughs) Me and a buddy hopped in an F102, we must haver flown over every square inch of West Texas looking for your car. (laughs) - You're kidding. - No. - What would you have done if you found me? - Hell, I don't know. I'd have probably landed the plane on the highway and kicked your ass. It's a hell of a thing for a father to have his own son run away from him like that. If I had believed in you a little bit more, maybe you wouldn't have. But you did fine. You did fine. ♪ Well I guess that you probably know by now ♪ ♪ I was one who wanted to fly ♪ I wanted to ride on that arrow of fire ♪ ♪ Right up into heaven ♪ And I wanted to go for every man ♪ ♪ Every child, every mother of children ♪ ♪ I wanted to carry the dreams - Ah, Milt, it's not here yet. - It sounds fine to me. - No, it's thin, you know, it needs to be fuller. What if, listen, what if we were to bring in an orchestra here. - Sure, John, but you gotta remember, we're paying for this ourselves. Not only are you hiring a big orchestra, but you gotta have a big studio. - Hey, Hal. - Your father's had a heart attack, John. (soft melancholic music) - [Irma] He's gone, John. (soft melancholic music) - John, I'm gonna go into town to work in the clinic. the kids should be home in about an hour. - Okay. - You know, everybody knows how hard it's been for you these last two months. - Everybody, huh, well, everybody knows how hard it's been for me? Well, I wish they'd tell me, because I am still having a very hard time figuring it all out. - Grief is a process, and what you're going through right now is just part... Maybe you should talk to Hal. You need to talk to somebody, and you're not talking to me. - Well, maybe it's because you keep talking to me like you're reading out of one of your college textbooks. - I don't know what to do. You don't seem to need me. You haven't needed me in a long time. I know how you're feeling. - No! You do not know how I am feeling, Annie. Would you stop saying that? All right, your father did not die at the exact moment that you were just beginning to know him! Your record company did not just suddenly decide that nobody wanted to listen to you anymore! You cut down our trees. You want to know how I am feeling? I will show you. - [Annie] John. (chainsaw buzzes) Stop, John. John, stop it. John, stop, John. (soft piano music) (panting) (sighs) - I've been trying to figure out a way, Annie... To tell you how sorry I am. I wrote you a song. (sighs) Please, just listen, Annie. - No. It doesn't work anymore. I want a divorce. (melancholic music) - I'm not gonna need to do that, you know, that's what I'm saying. (laughs) You know. You can't come to Australia and not see the great barrier reef. - [Male Voice] Not me. - You don't have to worry about sharks, sharks only eat drummers. (laughs) - Excuse me, I just wanted to let you know how much, very much, I enjoyed your concert tonight. - Thank you. - Catch you later, John. - My name's Cassandra Delaney. - Hello, Cassandra, I'm John. - I know. (laughs) - hey, have a seat. - You know, you have an exceptional voice. Wonderful range. - Thank you. You must be a singer. - Yeah, aspiring anyway. - You have exceptional eyes. (laughs) ♪ Sometimes I think that I'm dreaming ♪ ♪ Or maybe I'm going insane ♪ Or maybe it's just that I'm falling in love again ♪ ♪ Here I am standing beside you ♪ ♪ Oh life's such a wonderful game ♪ ♪ Look at me now, I'm falling in love again ♪ - Well, it looks like John Denver's fairy tale marriage to Australian Cassandra Delaney has come crashing back to reality. The rocky mountain singer is back in Aspen after he and Cassandra decided to call it quits. (background chatters) - [Female Attendee] I'm so proud of you. - That's so sweet. (laughs) - Congratulations. - Congratulations, Dr. Denver. - It's just a masters, John. - Hey guys. - Hi. - [John] You look great. You look, well, you look beautiful. - Thank you. - So, anybody have a desire to go to the movies with dear old man this weekend? - I do. - Zach, what about you? - Yeah, sure. - All right. I'll pick you guys up, say, Saturday afternoon? Okay. Listen, why don't you give me a moment here with your mama? I want to talk to her. All these years, Annie, you never gave up. I'm real proud of you. - Thank you. It's nice of you to come. - Hal tells me you're gonna start your own practice. - Well, it's not for sure, but maybe. How are you doing with everything? - Ah, busy, busy, with Windstar, and I've been writing a lot of new songs. I still can't seem to get any major labels to touch them, but... You want to go to the movies with us this weekend? - I don't think so, John. - I'm very proud of you. I don't know, Jake. Maybe I should reinvent myself, become a rap singer. - Now you're talking. - [Waiter] There you are. - Thank you, more of an edge. Dangerous. A little thing like divorce wouldn't affect me at all. I wouldn't lose a wink of sleep over it. - Goodnight. Hey, hey. Stay dangerous, man. ♪ You fill up my senses ♪ Like a night in a forest ♪ Like the mountains in springtime, ♪ ♪ Like a walk in the rain ♪ Like a storm in the (truck honks) (tires screech) - Thank again, fellas. We appreciate your discretion. They're gonna charge him with DUI. This divorce from Cassandra is really shaken him, Annie. I'm really worried about him. - Okay. Hi. - Oh, hi. So, do I get out of here now? - Not until the doctor comes back in. (laughs) - A little fender bender and they make all this fuss. - John. - Annie, can you hand me my jacket? - Oh, hey, you want to see a new picture of Jesse Belle? - Sure. - [John] Look at her. Isn't she grown? - She's a very beautiful little girl. - Yeah. She's a miracle. It's all been hell, except for her. Annie, i don't know why I married Cassie. I guess I was just... Annie, do you know what it's like to have all of these songs, all of this stuff you want to say, but no one wants to listen? I feel like I'm drowning. - John. - I'm suffocating here, Annie. (chuckles) Hell, when this DUI gets out, wow, how is that gonna look to everybody? - I don't care how it looks to everybody. What about the people in your life? Jesse Belle needs you, our kids need you. You don't even seem to know what you have. - Yes I do, Annie, okay? - Do you? Do you know what could have happened last night? Just, try to get yourself together. ♪ This old guitar taught me to sing a love song ♪ ♪ It showed me how to laugh and how to cry ♪ ♪ It introduced me to some friends of mine ♪ - Hey. ♪ And brightened up some days - [John] What are you doing here? - I thought you could use some company. Hal said you'd be here. So, working on a new version? - No, I'm just listening. - You mind me being here? I mean, you can be alone if you need to. - That's okay. - You know, I always liked this song. You all right? - Oh, I'm fine. - You want to talk about what's going? - What do you mean? - Come on, dad. - What's going on is, you know, I'm just, I'm listening. - The only thing, it just seems like lately-- - Zach, I'm fine. - Why won't you just talk to me, dad? - Zach, I got nothing to say. ♪ This old guitar gave me my life, my living ♪ ♪ All the things you know I love to do ♪ ♪ To serenade the stars that shine ♪ ♪ From a sunny mountainside ♪ And most of all to sing my songs for you ♪ ♪ I love to sing my songs for you ♪ - So, we're here, you got the fire going.

He'd shut me out. I never meant to do that to you guys. (sighs) First time your mom and I camped here, I wrote Rocky Mountain High. It just came to me all in a rush. I couldn't stop it even if I wanted to. I thought that's what really mattered. I could just sit back and let the music come, and everything else would just follow. But I blew it. - Dad. - No, I did. And I just wanted to apologize to you. - For what? - For doing exactly the same thing to you that my dad did to me, just flying away every chance I got. - Stop it, dad, okay. No one's saying that you weren't a good dad. - Yeah, but I could have given you guys so much more. - Maybe you weren't at home 24/7, but touring and music, it's what you did. - I thought a song could change the world. - Dad, we love your music. - Do you think we didn't get what you were saying? I mean, you stood for something. Grandpa used to say the same thing. - I love you guys. - [Anna] I love you too, daddy. - [Young Female] This is so weird. - What do you mean? - Didn't you used to be married to John Denver? - Yes, but I don't want to talk about me, I want to talk about you. - No, I am talking about me. I was 17 when I tried to kill myself. I stole a bottle of my mother's sleeping pills, then I went into my room and I locked the door. And I don't know why, maybe I was just too lonely, maybe it was just too quiet. I turned on the radio. And this song came on. Poems, Prayers, and Promises. This beautiful, simple song.

Don't forget about next weekend now, okay? - Oh yeah, sure, dad. - Thanks, pops. See ya. - We didn't do so bad, did we? With the kids? - We did pretty well with the kids. (sighs) How are you? - I'm better. I'm thinking about buying a new plane. - Really? - Yeah, it's called Long Easy. It's amazing. It's not like being in a plane at all. Flying like an eagle. Well. I better go. - John. - Yeah? - Have you written any songs lately? - A couple. Why? - I just want you to know that I think you're really good at it.
