--== McEphie ==-- For latest releases visit moviesnipipay website - ''TRIANGLE'' - I am... I am... I am... Luzviminda. I am Luzviminda. I am Luzviminda... I... am... I am Luzviminda Rivera-Palomarez Forty-five years old. Married. This is all I can say. What happened is not what I wanted. I did nothing wrong. I just defended myself. I defended my daughter. I didn't want... This would not have happened had I not returned to the world that I fled from. I was not born in this city but it's here that I became a woman. This is where I got my first period and where I lost my virginity. It was here that I learned to eat shit and where I became a bad girl. It was here that I fell; and I thought, if I got lucky... I don't know. I thought I would change here, too. I was fortunate to get married despite my past. The first thing we did as a couple was leave. We left the past behind. But now... the naval base left by the Americans is changing face. There are plenty of opportunities now for the ambitious and those who want prosper. My husband got convinced to return to take the risk hoping to get a bit of fortune. Chito's job is good. Executive, multinational company import-export. But he frequently needs to travel around the Asia-Pacific Region Just like now. He's headed for Bangkok. Surely he'll get a taste of Thai massage. Right in this city, one could have various experiences back then. If you have deep pockets, if you can dump out some cash you can get a taste of a lot of entrees. A lot of variety and a variety of shit. That was back then. Where did our quorum member go? We can't start this game without her. - Hello. - Minda, what took you? Sit down so our quorum can be completed. Gosh, we wasted our time for not being able to start playing. You just had to go somewhere else. My, it has taken a long while before we got to start. Come on, please wait for me. Oh, all right. - You were so late. - Mommy! So, are you okay? What? I'll join you there. Do I know you? That's Dave, Minda. He's a regular here. So, do you want to play? [SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING] Unlike Chito I barely got to study. I didn't even finish high school. We're nearly ten years married but until now his world is not my world. My world is my old world. It's not here anymore. It vanished along with the military base. It should have been over but I still can't escape from it. Please, come in. What are these? Why do you have a lot of these? That... that is my sideline. I'm a tattoo artist. What about this? Now that's my group-- "Jason and the Astronauts". You know if you want to watch us I'll take care of your entrance. That's me. Come here. Come here... Here are my tools, see. Plus, various colors. What about that? Why is your signage not outside? I'm illegal. Illegal. I just inherited this from my uncle. Earnings went down on tattooing then left during the '70s - and he went back to Davao. - Oh. How about you? Want a tattoo? I'd rather be bitten by a snake. [SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING] [BOTH MOANING] Dave... Please, stop it. I'm going home now. When can we do this again? I don't want things to get complicated. In order to resist temptations, I avoided games of mahjong first. But just like they say you can't easily get off the wagon. Is Aunt Minda there? Who are you, sir? Tell her I'm her nephew. Hold it right there, sir. - Marlyn, who's there? - Ma'am, he claims to be your nephew. Hi, Aunt Minda. Marlyn, how many times do I have to tell you not to let someone in if you don't know them? - But... - What if he's a thief or a murderer? Aunt Minda, it wasn't Marlyn's... Fine. You, come with me. - How did you get here? - I rode a motorbike. - What I mean is how did you know my address? - Sir, coffee's here. I'm a bit of a detective. Don't ever come back here. I don't want to see your face again. I don't want you stepping into my house again. Do you understand? What's your problem? Dave, I'm over forty years old now. Is that a problem? Why? How old are you now? Is that a problem, too? Please understand me, Dave. I have a husband. Where is he? Can he do what I can do? My life is already peaceful so don't you screw it. What happened between us was just a one-night stand, okay? It's over. The end. Let's get over it. Did you have a good time? You know, you shouldn't resist your urges, Minda. You'll upset your gut. Come here. Damn you! [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] We're almost there! Okay, this is the place. Feast your eyes, boys and girls. - Now, is everybody here? - Yeah. Okay, good. Straight ahead. Everybody, straight ahead now! Good. - Okay, is everybody alright back there? - Yeah! All right, a little more. We're going up! Okay, make sure if you're gonna hold on the branches make sure that there are no thorns, all right? Careful there. Careful. Listen up, guys. Our guide is saying that if you're gonna hold on to the branches you wanna make sure, check it first if there are thorns. - All right? Okay. - Yes. - Clear your way as you pass. - Okay. Come on. Finally. - Everybody all right? - Yeah! Hold on, hold on. No need to drink from the plastic bottle. Sir, could you show us where we can get water from the forest? Yes, ma'am. Always cut from the upper part... Okay, everybody, watch. That's the water dripping right out of the branch. - Woah. - Astonishing. Everybody, check this out! See the water? Cool, huh? All right, Stephanie. From now on, no more bottled water in the jungle, all right? Okay, let's go, let's go! - Let's go, let's go. - Come on, guys. Hurry up, hurry up. - [GUESTS APPLAUDING] - Ringo of the Philippines, friends! - On the rhythm guitar... - [GUITAR PLAYING] Bong, that was good! On the lead guitar, Mr. Jun Lopito! On the bass guitar... Rey de los Reyes! On the keyboard, Mr. Kix. Yes, Kix! And the Ringo of the Philippines... Mr. Dave O'Hara! And yours truly Jason the Thirteenth. Welcome to my nightmare! [GUESTS CHEERING] Everybody, we just have a request: just order more beer so we can have some fare to go home later. For the progress of our country, beer is what we need! Thank you very much! What happened to the one-night stand? Extended by popular demand. Hey! Hey, you there! You there! What, what? What are you looking at? Hey, hey, are you from here? How does an addict become an addict? How did I become a chain smoker? At first, just a try. You'll say you're just up to a try just so you can say that you tried for once. Then, one more stick. You think that you're under control, that you won't do it again, but you will do it again. You'll do it again and again. [MOANING] Next thing you know, your body craves more of it. The smell of the smoke, the warmth on the lips. The sexual urge is the same. It's very addictive. One night becomes two. Then that two is followed by more. Even the daytime becomes night. Any place becomes a room and a bed. You can't stop yourself. You want to stop, but... you just can't. Don’t worry about the risks. Sometimes you forget the shame and the fear. Marlyn, cut those too after that. - So many branches are sticking out. - Yes, ma'am. - They're not even anymore. - Got that right. And those shears are already dull. After you finish gardening have that sharpened. You're right. Our garden is small yet you still can't tend it. I was going to have it sharpened. I'm going out later. Once your sir calls, tell him to page me. Yes, ma'am. Excuse me. Is this the house of Ms.Luzviminda Rivera? Missus. Mrs. Luzviminda Rivera-Palomarez. Are you that Luzviminda? Why do you want to know? Are you the one in the photo? Where did you get this? Is that you? Who are you? My name is Stephanie. I'm your daughter. I'm sorry if I surprised you. Maybe I should've called first. I cannot deny that I am the woman who is holding the baby. But what proof do I have that you are this baby? Stephanie is the name you gave to your baby, right? There are many Stephanies in the world. Here. Birth certificate, baptismal certificate adoption papers, and a letter for you from those who adopted me. - Is he my father? - No. Then tell me, who's my father? Don't ask me about that. Why? Is he a bad person? Stop asking too many questions. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Stephanie, what do you need from me? Nothing. I just... I just want to meet you. I just want to meet my real mother. Look. If I'm not welcome, I'll just go and leave. Let me carry your stuff. The only person who lives here is me, Chito, and Marlyn. We only have three bedrooms now but I'll let you use this. She sleeps here and not in the servant's quarters. - Clean this up, okay. - Yes, ma'am. - Then get some new linens. - I will. - What's this? - That's my business. I bought them from Hong Kong before their turnover. Someone in Manila was going to buy them in bulk but he didn't arrive. I'm sorry about the room. I have nowhere else to put these. Put those in there. That's your size. Do you want that? - Take it. - Nah, it's embarrassing. It's your business. Plus, I'm just checking them out. It's wrong to turn down blessings. Take it. It's my birthday gift to you. Thanks. How many birthdays do I owe you? Twenty? Yeah, that's right. Marlyn, get this washed. If you want something washed, just give it to Marlyn. No, it's okay. I can do it myself. Where is the washing machine? You're not in America anymore. If you need something to be washed, just give it to Marlyn. You have your own bathroom but it'll be cleaned first. So if you need to take a bath do it in my bathroom for now. Okay. Thank you. Actually, I know what I will order for you. "The Burt Reynolds Special". Later, miss. It's like you're back in America because the steak is thick. Take this. I got this for you. "Ugat Pinoy"? What's this? That's the study tour I joined. It's an educational tourism program for Filipino-Americans. - Tour? - Uh-huh. So you had companions? We were many, plus a professor in Philippine Studies. But they all went back to the States. I'm the only one left here. So what did you do? You see, all of us from the States don't know anything about our roots. The idea is to give us first-hand experience of life here. What do you call it? ''An Encounter with Philippine Life.'' So we can discover our cultural heritage and our cultural identity. Wow. Heavy. We went to many places already. Palawan, Sagada, Banawe, even Smoky Mountain. But our last stop was the Jungle Survival Course here in Subic. You got it better. Unlike me, I haven't been to any of the places that you have mentioned. Maybe you should take the Ugat Pinoy program. You know, it's a good experience. In fact, this feels like a turning point in my life. I realized that even if my skin is whiter than most Filipinos, I'm not white. I'm Filipino by heart. Heavy. That's deep. It did get deep into me. It's good you can speak Tagalog. Others who were born in the States know only spokening dollars. My English is still spokening dollars. But... we speak Tagalog at home; and my parents talk to me in Tagalog. Excuse me. What do I call you, by the way? Mommy? Nanay? I don't know. Your choice. Minda. Minda will do. Shit! Shit. [PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING] So, what are your plans when you go back to America? Maybe I'll just study first. Maybe medicine since my daddy is a doctor and mommy's a nurse. I mean, those who adopted me. Good morning. Seems like you got home earlier. One of our meetings got canceled. So I decided to be a chance passenger. Why didn't you call me? I could've picked you up from the airport. I did call last night--midnight. I talked to Stephanie. You were asleep already. So I told her not to wake you up anymore. So you and Stephanie know each other already. Your baby? I don't know. Maybe just a ghost. Maybe I'm just dreaming. If she's a ghost, she's one pretty ghost. Just like her mother. When you got married, did you know she has a child? I know the ghosts of her past. I'm not afraid of ghosts. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [WHIRRING] - Stephanie. - What is it? - Thank you. - For what? - For covering up for me. - It's nothing. I just took a pit stop in Olongapo. Worked on a few things. A new business. I don't want Chito to know yet. He might not agree with it. You don't need to explain. But if you're in the mood to explain now, - I want to ask you something. - Sure. Why did you set me for adoption? How did you know... that you were adopted? Two years ago, after my debut. My parents confessed to me and gave me a photo of us two. But I've been hearing rumors for a long time. Stephanie. - Don't get mad at me. - I won't get angry. I just want to know. I was young then. Younger than you. I was just a teenager. I felt that... I won't be able to raise a child. Chito! Telling lies is an addiction. When you start with it... it's hard to stop. You don't want to hurt your loved ones so you keep your secrets and tell lies. When they start to suspect you will give them a bit of truth. You can't tell the whole truth. [DRUMSTICKS CLACKING] Hi, Aunt Minda. Oh, you must be Uncle Chito? - Oh, yes. - My mom mentions you. I'm Dave O'Hara. I'm Aunt Minda's nephew. She and my mom are cousins. - Oh, O'Hara? - Dave. Dave O'Hara. My father's a serviceman, an American. But he and my mom separated. Hi, I'm Stephanie. - Stephanie? - I'm Minda's daughter. Oh, why didn't you say that you have a daughter? So, how are we related? Cousins. Hey, give me five! What are you doing here? Our group has a gig here in Olongapo. I want to invite you. You will all be my guests if you want to go. Don't worry, this group's great. We just came from Japan. Dave, come in first. Have some beer. Oh, no need. I just came to say hi. Aunt Minda, mom sends her regards. You know, my ex-boyfriend's bike looks exactly like this. - Oh, really? - Yes. My friend is selling this to me. I am thinking if I can afford it. - You wanna ride? - Sure, why not? Come on. Thank you. - Stephanie. - [ENGINE REVVING UP] - Get off that bike. - Just for a bit, okay? I'll be back home for dinner. Bye. Those that look like black bags. - There, hanging on the trees. - Uh-huh. - Do you know what those are? - What? Dark Knight. You're really crazy. What's that? Those are bats. Lots of bats. Sleeping. No shit. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. They're coming our way. [YELPS] [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] Do you want to have a tattoo? Actually, I've long been wanting to have a tattoo. I'd like a unicorn. Can you do it? Where do you want it? You want it... here? Here? Or you might want... Here. Are you serious? Come here. Sit there first. Why a unicorn? Nothing. I just feel like it. I don't think there is a unicorn here but take a look. No problem there. That is just a horse with one horn on its head, right? Okay. Nothing to it. - Is that painful? - For virgins... yes. But if not... Won't your mother get mad? [GROANING] Just relax. Your daughter's not a minor anymore. It's hard to be a mother, right? Wait, aren't we cousins? Very, very distant. Dave. You're hurting me. Dave. Please don't. Dave. [BANGING ON DOOR] Wait. I said wait. - Oh, Aunt Minda. - Out of my way. You get out. - Let me pass through. - What's going on? Just a moment. - What the hell do you think you're doing? - You're a flirt. - Let go! - Come here. - Dave. - Dave, just relax. Relax. What have you been doing? Look what you're doing to your body. You look like a criminal. I don't want you to return to that house. Do you understand? I don't want you to see Dave. Do you understand me or do I need to repeat it? Look, Minda, I'm twenty years old. I can do whatever I want with my life. Don't give me that ''Look Minda... I can do whatever I want in my life'' tone. Hey, you're no longer in America. You are in my house, you are under my wing. While you're here, you follow what I want. If that's the problem, I'll just leave. It's you who came to me, Stephanie. I've already forgotten that I have a daughter, but you made me remember. Whether you like it or not I'm your mother. Respect me as your mother. And what kind of mother are you? - Don't treat me that way. - You don't want me anyway. You had me adopted. If you didn't want me then you sure as hell don't want me now. Stop it. I wish I didn't search for you. I wish you just had me aborted. - I said stop it. - Fuck you. [SOBBING] Stephanie, sorry. She's already asleep. I gave her some tranquilizer. I don't want to leave this way but... This is just a period of adjustment. We can do this. I hope so. Just be patient. You know, your mom is not used to being a mother. Okay, I'll leave now. Take good care of her. You may be the only one who understands her. - He's there. - Hi, miss. Dave, you will drive the bike yet you won't stop drinking. - Buddy, don't you trust me? - Dave. Jason. Come, to my place. Welcome to Olongapo Hilton. This is my place. Honey! Honey! Honeybun! - Honeybun? - Yes, coming. - [BELL RINGING] - Hey, children, go down now. They will be crashing here. - Here in our pad. Is it okay? - Agnes. Sorry, just for the meantime. By the way, Agnes, this is Stephanie. - My commander. - Hi. Dave's cousin. Cousin-tahan (PUN: GIRLFRIEND) - Sorry. - I'm used to it. Our place is like a people's hotel. Oh, these are my children-- Amihan, Buhawi, Kulintang. - Say hello. - Say hello to Aunt Stephanie. - Hello. - Hello. Hey, you're already late. You're already late for school, quick! Go now. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Cousin, huh? Cousin. Cousin. Dave, really, huh? Cousin? - Welcome to my nightmare. - Hey. - So, where do we stay? - Come in. And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson... [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Stay here first. Anyway, you won't know if someone sleeps there. Okay, let me check this out first. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] Why don't we just convert this to a motel? On your band members alone we will already profit. [MUTTERING] - Where? In front of this? - There. Rockers of this city, listen. Because the rock turned human is here. Child of Olongapo, an American, went extreme. The headache of the straights, an enemy of the conservatives. Revolutionary musician. We were hit by his voices. He made our stream of music explode. Brothers, the father of Filipino rock. Let's kiss the hand of our father-- Joey ''Pepe'' Smith! [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm waiting for a ride at Gapo I'm waiting for a ride at Gapo Hey, I've been waiting for four hours But I still got no ride All right, buddy, rock and roll. - Hey, Dave. - Dave. - Rock and roll. - Okay. - Bye, buddy. - What now? Are you interested in buying my bike? Buddy, I still have money problems. Wow, buddy. But you have a sugar mommy. Not anymore, bro. Crashed. She's Stephanie's mom. Wow, buddy! You banged Stephanie's mom. That's sick, bro. Wow! Wow, buddy. Hey, bro, that's just between us. Stephanie doesn't know that I banged her mom. Wow, man. - Let's go. - And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson Jesus loves you more than you will know Even the mom... you're heavy, bro. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] Wow, Dave, no matter what you do, I don't like CD files. The sound is too clean. Very clinical. Very studio-like. No soul. No angst. The problem with phonograph records is that it sounds like tin cans. And it has that hissing sound in the background. Dave, buddy, that's the right sound. The hissing you are referring to is the soul of the musician. Our soul, buddy. The whispers, even the fart, you will hear even the fart. [CHUCKLING] Even the fart. Jason, what's that? - That? - Yes. Crucifix. Isn't it obvious? Yes, I know. But why do you have a big cross inside your house when you are not even religious? The devotion of Jason Armstrong. My father I have placed into your hands My head What do you want, my life to go through suffering? You're not here Where are you? You are needed here Fetch your son now I still don't get it. Every year, during Good Friday, he carries a cross going up the mountain. Take a look, here. Like Jesus Christ, he is nailed. The blood of your son... Flows into... My God Why are you killing me? What? Your hands are really nailed? Yes, but don't worry. The nails are sterilized before I'm nailed. - Why? - Because I want to see my father. Just to see your father? Because what I only know is his name, his rank, where he's from. Ensign Earl Armstrong, US Navy from Louisiana. You see, his American father during the Vietnam War did an RNR here in the Philippines. - What is RNR? - Rock and Roll. Wait, it's like this: When the Americans lost in Vietnam his father went back. But the problem is there's no forwarding address. You know what happened? This Jason went on TV - and was interviewed. - Yes, buddy. - TV, TV, TV. Okay, okay. - The camera, quick, quick. - It's interview time. The camera. - Wait. May I make an appeal? - Hold on. - Faster, faster. What else? Okay, action! Would you like to send a message to your dad? Yes, I want to send a message to my father. Ensign Earl Armstrong. I am your son. I am sacrificing myself to wash away your sins. I am your son. I am sacrificing myself to wash away your fucking sins. - I can't believe you said that. - I said that. I was drunk then. Drunk. And I also need to be drunk so I don't feel the pain much when my hands are nailed. And you know, when I'm drunk, wow, I speak great English. But all the bad words are bleeped. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] My father got to watch it. Now, I'm going to America. You know, he already has a ticket to the States because his father bought him. Isn't that right? Yes. I'll go first, then I will petition my love--Agnes. Of course, with my children, too. - Stop, wait, stop. - Buddy, you know I don't have the money yet. Do something, please. Stephanie, you know now what you'll do. - What? - Jason's cross is yours. Don’t you want to see your father? - What will I do? - Your father. - We'll nail you there. - No, thanks. You, Dave, why don't you be like Jason? Me? Am I out of my mind? My mom said that when David O'Hara left us he didn't care at all. So I don't care about him, either. Fuck him! If I bump into him, I'll kill him. I just want to meet my father. I mean, just out of curiosity. There seems to be something missing in my life if I don't get to know who my father is. What do you plan to do now? I don't know. I'm confused. Maybe I'll talk to Minda again. You know, If I were you, I won't go back to her. You might just discover something you will regret. Wait, what do you mean? Nothing. It's like cleaning your garage. You get to see many different kinds of trash. That's all. [MOANING] Sorry. Why? Went limp again? Sorry. Just can't get it on. Chito is kind, but he is no longer the same person I first met. I don't know if it's just his age; or because of excessive drinking or because of the stress of his current job. But this is happening often lately. Even if he is really turned on his manhood won't cooperate. We haven't even finished yet but his cucumber withers like a leaf. - Dave, we still need to buy stuff. - That was a good jamming. Let's go to Jason's. - Well then? - You might forget, man. Hey, what do you have there? - Okay, man. We'll just catch up. - Just go to my apartment. Let's just meet later, man. - Let's all meet up there. - Well then, see you. - Yes, man. - Okay, chaps. - Hey, I want the big one. - Hey, man. Give Dave some beer. Hey, man. Cheers. - That's your last. You need to sleep. - Jason, your beer. - Kids, get some sleep. - Let us stay up. How can we sleep if you're so noisy? - Hey, you want a beer? - We're so noisy my kids can't sleep. But, Stephanie, you should've seen Olongapo when we still had those bases. Wow, it was really different. Really different. Wow, very different. You seem unhappy with the loss of the base. We're still a bit happy. But now, at least, we get to make more original music. - Right, man? - Hey, what was their favorite request back then? - It was... - Born in the U.S.A... - Wow, man. Classic. - Born in the U.S.A. Yeah, man. What I do miss is our American audience. If we have an American audience and if they get to like us the stage comes crashing! - Yeah! - Dancing, stamping, clapping. - [WHOOPING] - The cheering! [CHUCKLES] The Pinoy audience, though... I'm not saying all of them, okay. But they're shy. And teasers, too. Right, man? - More practice! - Wow, not cool, man. Turn-off, man. And the best back then after we're finished the acts that we got to watch. - They're all for free. - What acts? Don't ask. You might get shocked. For adults only! - Okay, kids. - That's a worn-out story. - Worn out. - Hey, how did you know about it? - Good night. Brush your teeth first. - Okay, sleep now. - Good night. Wait, a flying kiss first. So I'm the only one who's clueless. Wait, you? Clueless? - Oh, my. - Oh my, man. If you only saw the... strip acts back then. Wow, man. Very intense, right? The strip tease? Very intense. Especially, the best strip talents, man. - This is how they do it. - Show it. They'll go up the stage like this. Good. Grind more, man! Swing it more! Wait, hold it. Who has one hundred? Let me borrow. There. Look here, man. One hundred. It'll be folded, twisted then placed in the bottle's mouth. Followed by the downward grinding going down, going down... Then going up, and up. The hundred's gone! Where is it? Where is it? It's inside. That's gross. That's so sick. Hey, hey, hey, man. You know, the banana cutters are more intense. That's really more intense because it's much harder to do. - Show it, Dave. - Yeah, I'll show it. Like this. Get some music. Now... One, two, three, go! Burning the witch Burning the witch Burning the witch Wait, wait. There. Okay. Nice one, man! Okay! Good! That is absolutely gross. You guys are so sick. [MEN LAUGHING] - Sick, sick. - [PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] - [DOORBELL BUZZING] - It's the neighbors. They are already getting irritated. We have complains. Go and check the door, please. Tess, can you check? Wait, getting there. Hey! [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Dave, what did I tell you? I told you to stop seeing Stephanie, right? I told you to stop seeing Stephanie. Honey. Hey! But Stephanie doesn't want to live with you, Aunt Minda. So leave. Stop calling me aunt. Damn you. We're not relatives! Why, Dave? Don't you want to be with me anymore? If you don't want to, so be it. I'll just end it all. Damn you. I don't care about you! Just what is going on here? - Well then... - Get out... Maybe you like her more. If it's her, maybe you'll cry. Just what the fuck is going on? What the fuck, huh? What the fuck? You want to know why? Why it's what the fuck? Because this man... this man comes to me first. He gives me pleasure first before you. He fucks me first before you! Do you understand? - Do you? - Oh, my God! Just leave her alone. Just leave her alone! Stephanie! Stop it! I told you, Dave. Didn't I tell you to just leave her alone? Stop ruining her life. Stop it, Dave! - I'm not joking around! - Please, let go of me! Dave! Leave them alone, honey. Honey, that's enough! - You're crazy! - That's enough! - Damn you! - That's enough! - Damn you, too! - Dave, let her go! You're crazy! A secret was exposed that night. I felt better. It felt like I confessed to a priest. But the secret that escaped from me was actually a monster that will hurt others. He still has many other secrets to expose. We saw her loitering around the corner. Thank you very much, sarge. Stephanie? I don't want to go back home, Chito. Good evening, ma'am. Any baggage, sir? I already told sarge to bring all your stuff here. Don't worry. Nobody knows that you're here. - Why is she like that, Chito? - You know, Stephanie, your mom went through a lot of difficulties. I just want everything to be fixed before going back to the States. But now... you know, I really don't know anymore. She's so weird. It's like she has this multiple personality disorder. I don't know how many personalities she has but all of them are pretty scary. She's only stressed out. Right, whatever. Your mom is not a bad person. I'm going to tell you something but don't be surprised. When your mom was pregnant with you, she wanted to have you aborted. She went to an... abortionist. Why didn't she continue? She became nervous and prayed. And, while praying, she changed her mind. - Chito, can I ask you something? - Yeah. - Did you meet my father? - No. I'm sorry, Stephanie. I really don't know your father. What I know is that he's American and a customer of Minda. Customer? I'm sorry. I didn't know that... you didn't know. But it's probably better... that you find it out here than from someone else. When Subic was still a naval base you mom became a dancer in a club in Olongapo City; and part of a dancer's job is to entertain customers. You mean... They can be taken out of the club as long as the bar fine is paid. You mean she was a prostitute? Look, I don't wanna use that term. And even if you knew, you still married her? I became her customer, too. - Regular customer. - Regular customer? Stephanie, that happens. And I'm not the first man in the Philippines who... fell in love and married a bargirl. If Stephanie didn't return to me, if she just went back to the States, I wouldn't be surprised. I'll be upset, but... I'll understand that decision. But she returned. Even if she said nothing, I knew that she understood me or was trying hard to understand me. She still wants to give a chance to the bastard she calls mother. Maybe it was better... if she didn't return. We could've been both at peace. Stephanie, I can't do this anymore. Marlyn, buy me some cigarettes. You can do it, Minda. You can do it. Here, I brought you some substitute. Minda, how long did you work in the club? Quite long... around ten years. I was only sixteen years old when I started. Do you know the meaning of... banana cutter? You need to let that out, Minda. Whatever is inside you, you have to let that out. - Stay away from me! - Let it out, Minda. - Come on. - Leave now! Let it out, let it go! - Why are you asking about banana cutters? - Minda... - Are you insulting me? - No, no... - You already know, right? - I dunno. - You already know what used to be my job. - I don't know. Come on, Minda. - You're ashamed of me, right? You're ashamed of me. - I'm not... - You're ashamed that your mother was a banana cutter. - Stop it. - You want it too, right? - No. You're a flirt. - You're a flirt. - Minda, please. - You like it, right? - I know nothing, really. You want to be a banana cutter, too? No, please. Well then. I'll teach you how. It's like this. Damn you! Minda, don't. That's enough. Please, enough. Enough. - Enough! - [MINDA GRUNTING] Enough. It's okay. It's okay. - Enough. It's okay. - Stephanie... I don't know who your father is. That's okay, Minda. That's okay. - I don't know. There were many. - What? There were many. Someone paid a bar fine. He brought me to his rented place. Other people were there, playing poker. Four. All of them white. Two of us were in the room. I and the one who paid the bar fine. But that bastard had other plans. - [MEN LAUGHING] - I wasn't able to do anything. They did it to me one after the other. - [SOLEMN MUSIC PLAYING] - [SOBBING] - One last question, if it’s all right. - Okay. Because I won’t be able to sleep if I don't ask this. All right, it did me well anyway. I finally got it all out of my chest. Sure? Why didn't you file charges? Or reported to the media? It was hard to confront the bases during that time. They will just ship out their men. Besides, who am I to complain? It will just add to my embarrassment. Okay, you've answered my question. Here. Rest now. Wait, do I really need this? Can't I just have a cigarette? I just prayed to all the saints that I wish they will all die in Vietnam, those sons of bitches! [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Come in. After taking the meds, she slept. Poor Luzviminda. Her sufferings are endless. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [WATER RUSHING] [SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING] What are you doing here? [SHUSHING] Be quiet. Chito. Chito. We're over, Dave. You're history. History, huh? History, huh? Chito. You don't mean what you say. No. Not here, Dave. - [MOTORCYCLE REVVING] - [ANXIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] Hi, Aunt Minda. You bastard! Beast! You're a beast! You don't want to, huh? What? You, too! You're just like your mother! You both think you can handle me? I'll kill you both! We're not done here! Minda. Minda, no. Minda, enough. Enough. Enough, Minda. [SOBBING] Enough. You disgraced my daughter. You hurt her. You raped my daughter. You hurt her. I just defended myself. I just defended my daughter. I just defended my daughter... [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
