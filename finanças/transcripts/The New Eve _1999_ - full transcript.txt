THE NEW EVE - Nathalie, Nathalie! We're closing. We're closing now, please. Bring back the floats. You, out of the water! Let me go... No, no! Get out of the water, I said! - I don't want to leave. - What are you doing in the water? - My towel... - Do you want me to lock you in? Is that your son, madam? - Nathalie! - Out, or I'll empty the pool! - My towel. - No one in the water, I said. And you, crocodile, who told you to run? - Marc! - Get your skates on! Come on, everyone outside now. We're closing. Babysitters are expensive. We need to find somewhere to sleep. When you go out unplanned, it's complicated... or you have to warn us in advance. There's always Camille in an emergency. Or we can look after them here. - He looks calm. - Like his mother. - They get it from me. - He really is calm. - Perhaps he's dead. - Is he dead? - What did she day? - Nothing. That he's sleeping. - So, Camille, you're not tempted? - No thanks. Me and children... When you're pregnant... - everything's different. - I know. - You lost it? - No. - Well yes, sort of. - Can you manage without forks? It's fine. Are you just here to eat because it's free? I was making conversation. We're not talking kids all night. You've kept on about your sex life. My sex life would be more exciting. Listen, Camille, I'm not judging you, but there are certain rules. That's all! What? Because I wasn't interested in your wife? You aren't very adult. You're not judging me? What is it, darling? I was thinking. You know, all this time... I don't even know what a condom is. - You've got your whole life for that. - Carry on, thanks. It's true that I'm a baby. Now you'll have two babies. - But when I see you - - Don't worry, my love. Tell yourself somebody loves you. You're not alone. You still have so many things to do. You haven't failed. Yes, you left your number. And you're tall with curly hair? Yes, okay. What's the address? Okay. Yes, straight away. Bye. They're waiting. - I'm going out. - Who with? I don't know. Something will happen to you one dy. That would be nice. I looked for you everywhere. I just arrived. I'm going down. Are you coming? Yes, I don't know anyone here. Was there something in the punch? Here, here. No, with your mouth! Sorry to spoil the fun. Have you got another? I'll do it. - Oh yes! - Can I squeeze your breasts? Later. Can I? Can I? No, that hurts. Stop. I don't feel like it. - Later, then? - Yes, alright. I'll get the drugs. I'll see you up there. There really was something in the punch! Don't worry. So she was sitting opposite me... and she suddenly pointed to the window behind me. "There's a man!" "Am I a man?" "No, behind you.." "Miss, there's no man." "Yes there is. Outside." "There's nothing outside. We're on the fifth floor." The next morning, I discover that my colleague, who lives next door, was burgled during my appointment. I'm seeing this patient tomorrow. What should I tell her? I think that you should always tell the truth. Yes. The truth. Yes. Are you analyzing or being analyzed? Excuse me, I've got the wrong party. One! Two! Three! Bravo! What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? I've got some pills. And I've met a little black girl. In ten minutes a couple of friends will join us. They're really nice. I've reserved the back room. If you want to put something on, ask Laurence. She threw up everywhere, even on my bed. She ruined my evening! Camille, can you hear me? Girls. Hey, wake up! Camille, wake up. Why are you here? This is not the place for you. Okay? Get her out right now! What does he want? Let me go! Solveig! Let's go. What's happening? He's been hurt. I hate couples. They just produce kids... and talk about work, the nursery, baby food, nappies, holidays, where to rent or buy a house, skiing, beaches, family. Well, those folks weren't... making so much conversation. No, I'm talking about my brother. You need to concentrate. They would prefer it if I were like them. But they blame everything on me. So you haven't given up. Yeah, but that means I'm single. When I see them with their whips, handcuffs... - Your brother? - No! The others! Her brother is into dummies and baby bottles. Actually, you're a true romantic. Exactly. I'm a true romantic. Poor thing, you've got a long way to go. Are you asleep, Camille? I'll need your help today. - What? - It's the twins. I'll get them if they do it again. And don't run! It's so noisy today! The twins! Out of the water immediately. Twins, out of the water now! Get your things and your brother and go home! We paid. We'll stay as long as we like! What's going on here? - It's her. She hit us. - No, I only hit one. - That one. - Yes, alright. - Go, get out of the pool! - We're going to tell our dad! I'm not mad. You're talking to me as if I am. You go to sleep too late, you wake up too early, you're irritable. You asked me about my life. That's not why I'm here. What about my rash? - Yes, well, a rash-- - I smell of chlorine. Even after two or three showers. I'm not prescribing you a deodorant. Your life will get back to normal with those. A lotof people follow this treatment. Hang on. I'm not like that. I'm not mad. You know, we're all a bit mad. Speak for yourself. - You're not well? - Yes, yes. - Is something wrong? - No, it's nothing. - Are you sad? - No, I'm crying because it does me good. Crying, it's important. It eliminates the toxins. That's destructive. It's not surprising that you're in this state. You're right. I'll throw them out. There. Good. Maybe not. Perhaps they will do me good. On the other hand- There. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Wait. Take it. I'll wash it for you. Tell me where to return it. Don't worry. You can keep it. You must be a great person... to stop like that in the street. No, I think it's normal. It's not at all normal. You're not an egoist. You think of others. You give up your time. You're incredible. Actually, I'm vindictive, a moaner, and I'm terribly prone to vanity. And I'm often cowardly, so you see- - Thanks all the same. - Please. Really. You disappeared the other evening. Everything about you haunts me. Camille, the curve of your eye goes around my heart. I'll wait for you on Saturday at Laurence's. Camille, it's the Big Fox here. Call me back at 45-54-67-90. Hi, guys! It's good you came. How are you? - Your brother is up there. - Oh, lovely! I've got loads of people to see. Start downstairs, the bar is there. Has he been painting long? Twenty-five years. What do you think? Not bad. Well, not brilliant. We should have started upstairs. - Oh, I don't know. - Yes, with the bar. Excuse me. Really... Every time! - How are you? - I'm okay. It's great to see you. Not cross with me anymore? - No, not at all! - Are you sure? - Don't worry! - That would be terrible! - You got my letter? - Yeah. - Hi, Emile! - Hey. How are you? I've brought a friend along. Louise... Solveig... and my sister Camille. This is Alexis. Excuse me. I'll introduce you to the artist. That's a friend of mine arriving. Why are you cross with me? Who is Alexis? He's on the council. He gave me a job. Now he's a friend. - He's in politics? - Mm-hmm. He's in the Socialist Party, the 19th branch. - He's one of the party leaders. - What? The Socialist Party. It's not my idea of fun. You're just a kid, Camille! - Still arguing? - Yes, we're off again: the petit bourgeois... Not your team leader trip again. Why are you digging at me? It's quite beautiful. You think so? Don't you? It's been the same for ten years. It varies a little, depending on the trend. But, if you like it-- You don't like paintings unless they're pretty. You have very common taste. That must be it. And you're the eternal skeptic. Not at all. I'm nothing like that. You put everyone down but make nothing of your own life. What do you know? Then you crack up, take medication, and break down, And if you get attention, you're happy, but only for five minutes, and then you're off again. That really is low. That is really, really low. Camille, one for the road? Bye. Maybe some other time. -"Maybe some other time." - What's his problem? Leave it. He's an idiot. Could you pay now, please? Yes, but I'd like another coffee. Tell me... do you know a man around 40, medium height, brown hair, balding? His name is Alexis. He works for the Socialist Party. No, I'm being stupid. Sorry. Don't worry. It's been such a long time! How are you? I don't come to Paris often. What luck! Do you want a drink? It's such a long time. So much has happened. I am divorced-- well, not really. Excuse me! You should pay more attention! You're crazy! Sorry. Now I understand why we lost touch. You are so indifferent towards others. You don't care, you're so selfish... with your wants, you whims. I don't know how... you keep your friends, if you still have any. Well, I don't give a damn! I'll have a martini. Some are demanding an unconditional and massive settlement. If we refuse, it could be a disaster. Voters will hear the mermaids singing, if you know what I mean. You're preaching to the converted. Illegal immigrants... are exploited. They have to live an underground life. It's intolerable. Excuse me. Hello, I'm Camille. If we throw out 100,000 illegal immigrants, does it make extra space? To get rid of illegal workers, you think you must get rid of the immigrants. Do you think that's how it works? Do you know a lot of people- I have coffee with them. - Perhaps it's not enough, but- - I treat them. What about you? I sleep with them. Could we raise the tone, please? No, no, it's very good to go out into the field. Bye, Alexis. See you on Thursday. See you Thursday. Funny, we keep bumping into each other! My brother said you were in politics, but not where. Is this your first political meeting? No, I did this often when I was a student. I felt the need to commit myself again, to be where the action is. - Not disappointed? - Not at all. Excuse me. Goodbye. Don't forget I can't come on Thursday. - Goodbye. - I won't forget. I wanted to say... I liked what you said. Thanks. I got carried away. We don't know people better by sleeping with them. If all the militants were like you, the debates would be more lively. You should come back. - Really? - Yes. It's every Thursday. Should I pay for my card? - Sorry? - I don't know... I don't know how much the membership card is. We can sort that out next week. - There's no rush. - Alright. See you Thursday. Bye. See you on Thursday. Who is that girl? We were saying she is a bit-- A bit rough! Louise, I was thinking... We don't talk about politics anymore. People around us talk more about their investments. Meeting people, exchanging viewpoints-- I liked all that. You were a dictator. You upset so many people! I was young then. It would be different now. - When are we going? - Ten minutes. I'm cold. Ada, go and get your scarf, I'm coming. This might be the moment to get involved again. How? I was thinking with the Socialist Party. Camille, are you putting me on? They've done loads for homosexuals! - You can't argue with that! - Camille! You're in favor of zero growth. Why not, though? We shouldn't force people to produce washing machines just to pay for their own washing machines! You should join the Greens or the League, if you're not too old. Because you don't think the same way, I have to keep quiet? We'll continue with that next time. I need a hand tomorrow to put the posters up. You two take the Rue du Gymnase, alright? I'll pick up the kids and we'll do the town hall. Alexis, where are you going? Along the avenue, to do the electoral boards. And then wherever. Okay, that's fine by me. I'll take some too, then. Follow me. How are you doing? Careful, it will fall. I've done this before with the League and for friends' rock bands. You have more talent for diatribes against consumer society. It will come back with practice, don't worry. Have you always worked with the socialists? No. What did you do before? I studied. Studied what? Medicine. As I have always been in politics, it was natural to continue. Always with the socialists? Yes. I know, it's not very glorious. Wait, I wasn't being sarcastic! It's clear the party isn't the ideal place for you. - You don't want me back? - It's not that. It's just that I think you find us too soft - Not radical enough. - No, not at all, really. I'm all for socialist ideals. I think that local politics is really important, and honestly, the socialist party is the only place to rethink Marxism, - now that it's dead. - You're not wrong. Now we need to cover the neighborhood. Shall we go to my place? Good idea! Where is it? This way. Sorry about the mess. No, I like the mess. Thanks. That's kind. That's very kind. Good evening. lsabelle, Camille. Camille, lsabelle. Alexis has told me about you. She helped with the posters. I didn't want her catching pneumonia. - Would you like a hot drink? - No thanks. I'm fine. Yes. - Are you married? - Yes. Bourgeois, isn't it? No. Yes. - Would you like to stay for dinner? - No thanks. It's okay. - Sure? - Yes, I've got loads to do. - You'll come back? - Alright. And his wife, what is she like? Economics professor, brilliant, sure of herself. A nightmare. Didn't you think he might be married? No. Look at my grandpa. He always loved the postwoman. After the war, she was married. So he married my grandma, who drove him mad. When she died, he moved next to the postwoman. They ended up living together. That's a lovely story. It can't have been The Empire of the Senses. Especially since she died six months later. That's right, cheer me up! - Wait, you're not really in love? - No. I won't carry on begging intimacy here and there. I'm not going to pick up the crumbs! With a married man too! - I'd have liked to have seen a western. - Which one? I'm completely depressed. Double six! I've got the tail! It's about time. Aunt Camille, you're not doing it properly. It's Camille. Hey, look. It's really good. He's talented, your brother. He told me you had all the ideas. I worked with him at art college. - I could help. - That's nice of you, but the work is finished and the move is organized. You shouldn't have. We've got enough help. Only natural. Put it down! Put it in there. The cellar is full. Careful with the crystal. Watch out. Wait! Thank you. It's great here, especially for a young family. The kids on the first floor, and the parents at the top. You don't lose the intimacy. And they each have their own bathroom. What shall we do? Wait, put it here. You really are strong. It suits you, though. In the living room. Okay? Would you like a drink? How about a beer? - Will you stay for dinner? - I don't know. Stay for dinner. Well, if it's an order. Oh, no, Camille! The chest doesn't go in this room. I'll kill him. She hates me even more now that she knows you. She's found a new family, so her brother- It's not about family, stupid! Aunt Camille! Don't call me Aunt Camille! That's enough, girls. Aunt Camille has been working hard. Leave Aunt Camille in peace! Get some rest. You said you were tired. Dad! Let's play on the seesaw! You think we should? I don't know if it's strong enough. We haven't introduced ourselves yet. My name is Benjamin, but people call me Ben. Camille. - Am I heavy? - Yes. I work with Alexis sometimes. I give him a hand at the town hall. Get the guys singing, the old folks voting. Stuff like that. No, I'm joking. I'm going back to Paris, if you want a ride. No, it's alright, thanks. I'll manage. You can't go back on the train. It's a real pain. Well, if you want. I have to let it warm up a bit. I knew it! I liked you as soon as I saw you. I knew there was something. We'll really get along. I know it. Shut up, shut up. What's this? There. I went to Rungis. Do you think I'm stupid? Not at all. It's adorable. There's a rose thorn in my bottom. I have to suck out the venom. What venom? How are you? - Not too tired? - I'm okay. - 6 and a half pounds. - That's not much. It's a real success! Do you want to hold it? I'm completely stressed. I'll drop it. How was the delivery? It was really painful, I wonder how they managed before. Even with the epidural, they gave it to me too late. The contractions started, and then I couldn't feel anything... so they made me stand up. You were standing up? When I saw the head, I felt something. - A vision. It was amazing. - It's hell... but you should experience it. What are you doing, Camille? Don't! - Are you doing it on purpose? - Sorry. The doctor said I can breastfeed him! Oh my god! That was my first time. The guy gave me this thing, a cock ring. But it wouldn't go on. My balls are too big. He said I was doing it wrong. Then he asked me to turn around and he licked my asshole... Well, I'll spare you the details. Then I took a good sniff of poppers... and when he put it in, it really did something. I thought my head would explode. Not much effect on my ass. I was really surprised. Do you want some? Poppers? No way, it will do my head in. Do you mind me telling you all that? No. Does it excite you? No. It's normal to talk about everything. It takes some people ten years... to realize their husband or wife is into orgies or S&M. What I want is to create a family. But being honest, totally open. So I talk about everything. When I was young, my father was never around. That's why I only do short distances with the truck. Pass the poppers. I can't! I can't do it! Are you okay? What's up? Are you pregnant? No, listen. It doesn't matter. It's nothing, and it's not expensive. No, Ben. Really, I don't want it. I thought it was for you. Listen Ben, it's good when we're together, but... it's not what I want from a relationship. I don't expect anything. I don't care. It's great when we're together, but-- I'm sorry. I think that... I don't think I love you. In the way you want. Wait. That will come. No, I don't think so. You can't forget about someone else? Yes, perhaps. Why do you love him? He'll never leave his wife. Alexis is an intellectual. He wouldn't like this stuff. You can't deny it. I don't understand. Why are you talking about Alexis? Please, I'm not that stupid! I never slept with him. I promise. He's just a friend. I hardly know him. The truth is, but keep it quiet... I've been seeing someone for several years now. A man -- a married man. Stop it! Emile, champagne? Look, I've got orange juice. - They're amazing. - What are? The orange trees. And you girls, when are you going to have a kid? - We'll see. - Very funny. No, this is my second glass. - I'm not drunk. - I didn't say anything. You think I would... have been happier with Gilles... Denis or Robert? - How are you, Emile? - Fine. Will you be okay? I'll be off, then. I'm no good. I couldn't make the meetings. If you think I'm not serious, I won't come back. What's wrong? Why does everyone ask? Do I look ill? A little, yes. Sorry I disturbed you. I talked to the guy from the Socialist Party, it was like listening to a sermon. At least he believes in something. It's better than being an artist... waiting for your inheritance. What's up? You've found your political conscience? If you carry on, you'll join up. It'll be depressing. Now I'm the court jester. I didn't say that. - Have you been brainwashed? - You pissed me off! - Sorry! - No, stay. Go on. Everything okay? Sorry, I didn't say anything. I was a bit hard on you before. - Upset by the split? - I don't care about Ben. I only went out with him to pass the time. I was all alone. You just wait. One day you'll meet someone who loves your stubbornness. It's just not the right time. You're likeable. There's no reason. You can't stay here alone. No, stay. - I've got to go. - Are you going home? God, how stupid! - I'm sorry. - It's alright. - It's okay. - Here. Thanks, that's kind. Careful. I'm sorry. Sorry. I did it on purpose. What? Alexis, you're the one I love. I've been madly in love with you for two months. You haven't noticed, but it's eating me up, and getting worse. I thought one day I would see you... as if nothing had happened... but each time it's worse, like an illness. I couldn't cope if we stopped seeing each other. I didn't realize. Should I not have told you? I can't, I don't want, I can't have a mistress! I don't want to leave Isabelle. It would be... hopeless, frustrating, mediocre. I want to. No. Okay. Go, then. Shall we go? What's happened? I'm too hot. - And your hand? - I just trapped-- - I trapped his fingers. I'm clumsy. - Did you take a shower? It's getting late. Come on, let's go. Camille, dinner on Wednesday still? Goodbye. Will you be okay? I'll have a martini. 400 francs? - Pardon? - 500 francs? Sorry, I'm not used to doing it for the money. But I need to talk, so if you're not off duty... I thought so. We've already met. Are you analyzing or being analyzed? I'm not sure if I'm analyzable. Is it my round? Nathalie? He's the one I love. It makes me cry. I know I love him. And I know that I'm right. When we are sincere, we can only be loved. I know there's something there. I'm sure of it. So many things have proved it. You don't think so? Well... falling in love with a married man... is like fighting for your own unhappiness. It's the best way of going nowhere. It's a way of ensuring that it won't work... without taking responsibility. Then there's the wife, the children, etc. It's masochism. When I fell in love with him, I didn't know he was married! Of course. But when we are in a state of neurosis... we quickly develop a kind of sixth sense. Why does it work sometimes? I mean many people divorce... and go to live with their lover who's been waiting for a long time. I don't know if it's determinism. I'm not convinced you are right. If you like. Thank you. Are you married? Yes. So you're an unavailable man. Yet I don't need to see you again. - You never get bored? - Not at all. We have other things to do. There's a theater close by. Yesterday we saw L'Illusion Comique. I thought it was overdone. Yes, it was rather pompous. - But it wasn't bad. - It was soporific! I get it. Really boring. But while we were out, you found it interesting. That's true. No, I was first! Good night. We brushed our teeth for three and a half minutes. - Can we read before bed? - Yes, but no more than ten minutes. I'll come and choose a book with you. Good night, Aunt Camille. What did I say? - Where are your slippers? - Upstairs. Of course. And the stairs are full of splinters. What story? "Little Red Riding Hood." Alexis, I should never have come. Why? It's as if you haven't understood. As if it had already passed. You're flaunting your relationship. - Is it on purpose? - So why did you come? It makes me happy to see you. You shouldn't have let me come. I'm sorry, but this is getting too complicated for me. Why didn't you stop Isabelle from inviting me? I didn't think. But now I'm here, and... You're whispering with your wife next door. Camille, you're impossible. It's unbelievable! - I've seen a shrink. - Oh, yeah? Either I'm a masochist... who wants you because you're unavailable... or I'm right to love you... and we'll end up together. - Stop it! That's stupid. - So? I don't know. I don't believe in Freud. I chose Marx. Get back there. I've never met anyone like you. You're a real terrorisst. You spend your time protecting yourself. Damn! That's not on! They want you to tuck them in. They've been making a fuss. There are so many children's books to choose from. And the critics don't help! Yes, it's awful. Don't worry. I really need to pee. You don't need to go upstairs. It's right there. What am I doing here? It will be okay. It will be okay. Shall I go up and get Alexis? No, he'll be down. He has to tuck them in. Camille? Alexis is mine. Alright? But there's nothing-- I know, but-- I don't know if we should get them a dog. They seem to be going through a sado-analysis phase. You would know. You're a whiz at psychoanalysis. She's a whiz at psychoanalysis? - No, nothing. - Are you in analysis? Sorry, you're right. It's personal. - Alexis, what are you doing? - I had to wait. There was a problem with the flyers. I've had enough. Come on, the market packs up in an hour. Sorry, but I can't hand this out. It's verbiage. You really take people for idiots. You think I'm being difficult? Yes! Politics isn't therapy. If you're not mature, nobody is forcing you! Write them yourself, then you'll be happy. And you're mature? Security for homes, democracy, public transport for kids. What do you want? Your life, your so-called commitment-- that's crap! Stop mixing everything up! You think you're a good person because you think about others? You're speaking on behalf of them. So you're not speaking for anyone! Stop that! You're out of order! If it's like that every time, let it go! I shouldn't have let Isabelle invite you. I promise it won't happen again. What does that mean, punishment? I'm being punished? I don't care. Here's my card! Take it and your stupid flyers and you'll never see me again! I don't want to see you again! You tell your wife everything. I don't know why I fell in love with you! I must be looking for failure. Well, I didn't fail with you. Idiot! I haven't been thrown out. It's me who's quitting! Okay, we'll start with the market. You take that end of the boulevard. We'll do this end. We wanted to celebrate Solveig's job. - Where were you last night? - My place. That's not true. I called. What's the job? Layout for a Catholic newspaper. It's not brilliant. - I phoned several times. - I was asleep. I was tired. - Were you with Alexis? - No, I wasn't with Alexis. - Someone else? - You don't know him. - What about Alexis? - Listen, it's over. It was a complete failure. You shouldn't say that. It was an experience. A virtual one, but an experience! It was hopeless in every way. I thought it looked more like love. "It looked like love"-- Are you mad? Don't you get tired of talking rubbish? Right, if you start again, I'll get angry... and you know what I mean. - Yes, you hit hard. - Exactly. - That's why you were sent away. - No. I wasn't sent away, - I wasn't well. - That's for sure. Camille, there's a man here to see you. He's dressed. I told him to undress, but he didn't want to. - He wasn't that shy last night. - His name's Alexis. No! I hesitated to come. Your quitting doesn't mean... we can't see each other. It's true. I've got two tickets for Lou Reed. Interested? I don't know. I'll think about it. I'm coming. Wait for me. Octave... I'm not staying long. In fact, I'm going now. If Jean-Luc comes, tell him I'm sick, and it's contagious. - Here we go again. - See you tomorrow. What are we doing? We'll be late. I thought we had time! Can't we have a coffee and talk a bit? Do you have something to tell me? What about this? I don't like it. What do you think? Very nice. What are you doing? Get out or I'll call for help. Go on, then. Help. I love you, I love you. I love you. I'm so happy. Well? We'll go in the toilets. - What time is your meeting? - I can be late. Hi, girls. - And Denis, did it work? - Yes, it worked. He'll be here this afternoon. Hello, young mother. - You don't look well. - You really do talk rubbish. What has happened? No, nothing's happened. Emile! Telephone! I'm sure he's got someone else. He's always tired, and he doesn't want me anymore. But I don't even have the courage to find out. If he had a mistress, she wouldn't call here. Emile is smarter than that. He's just tired. He's not like a man in love with someone else. Listen to Camille! My brother would never do that. You've had his child. He loves you. And he's already talking of another one. When you have children... you are indestructible. Maybe a little adventure now and again... but after years have gone by, it never lasts. Solveig and Louise have no kids... and they are indestructible. - You coming to the Entr'act? - Any good-looking men there? Hello, crocodiles. I've got a great spot in the cellar. - That's what I need. - You look distracted. - Five minutes, okay? - No, five seconds. I'll be there. - I've got a date in the cellar! - The cellar? Very exotic. Well, see you later! How are you? - Are you coming tonight? - Where? - The Entr'act! - Do you want a drink? - Esther, Françoise. She's coming too. What's that noise? It's my mouth. When we kiss, listen. Louder, then. I can't hear it. Got any tranquilizers? Something strong? It's for Emile. He's going through something. Not even Valium? Don't be ashamed! - Here you are. - You've got some? But take it with vodka, because with whiskey... It's Emile! Shit! Barrois and his wife! Tell me when they've gone. Alexis, this is ridiculous. I know. There's something wrong here. First I was happy, always cheerful. We had sex... you said you loved me. I must have missed something. Alexis, you can't hide under the table. Get out! Get out! Anyway, he's gone. It's ridiculous. You've split my lip. If he hadn't gone, would you have eaten under there? Of course not. I don't feel well. Camille, you're a pain! A real pain! You did warn me that it would be no good! What should I say? That we'll live together? Should I say something I don't believe? No! Or, yes, if only for the pleasure of sending you packing. You had an effect on me the first time I saw you--after that. If you hadn't always been there... And now this is how it is! I know what I feel. Leave it. It's me. I'm looking for trouble! Do you have sex with her? This should spice it up. Yes, that's right. Now go on! What are you doing now? Being the difficult mistress! Is the car in the parking lot? Let's go to the parking lot, then. Things are improving, then? You seem better for seeing a shrink. - Are you progressing? - Yes. - Today I made three Freudian slips. - Good. I was wrong about you. I saw you as a degenerate. I was a real jerk. - You're just saying that. - No, I promise. I told everyone that. I've realized that you're fulfilled, different and happy. Can we work together again? You had talent. - Why did you stop? - Because you gave me grief. What's his name again? I came to see how you were doing. Why did you come? - Don't worry. It's the pills. - Hang on. What have I done? I've told him. He thinks you're a bastard to your family. - Oh, great! Thanks! - No, that's not true! In his state, I could tell him anything. Wait. Wednesday I have a conference in Normandy. I'll be there until Tuesday. You could join me Friday evening. We'll get four days together! My hand's stuck in the chocolate jar! Let yourself go! Stop. Hi! Hi. How are you? Very well. - And Alexis and the kids? - Great. Alexis is at a conference. I'm taking the girls to my parents' place until Sunday. And Alexis is back on Sunday evening. He was going to return on Tuesday, and now he's coming back on Sunday. Well, he should be. Maybe Sunday, maybe Tuesday. I don't know. Hello, Aunt Camille! Come on, girls. We're going home. Can't we stay a bit longer? No, I said we're going. Now you know that I know. Good luck. I have a reservation for Mrs. Engels. Engels. Yes. Mr. Engels will arrive later. Room 19. On the first floor. Come in. We've got the weekend! Until Tuesday? Until Tuesday. - Hello! - Hello! What did you do while you were waiting? I read about politics and the Socialist Party. It was really interesting! Take off your jacket and relax. Take off your tie, your shirt-- You take everything off too! You were right. They were ducks. I'm off. Join me if you like. There's a good restaurant nearby. We could go on Monday evening. Yes, but think about what you want to do before that. Anyway, we've got enough time, until Tuesday. Yes. I've got a meeting in Franche-Comté soon, to tie up those nominations. There must be a nice hotel in the area. It's next month. Excuse me. We can't stay until Tuesday. I was going to spin you a story, but I'd rather tell the truth. Thanks. Don't hold it against me. I'm not. You're a really great guy. I didn't want to spoil everything. That's why I didn't say earlier. Right. I'll go and tell reception... and we've still got this evening. Are you cross with me? No, no. I'm glad I came. I'm slow. I'm in a hurry. Happy birthday, Solveig! Great! I thought you couldn't make it. I got away sooner than expected. Did you see Solveig blow out the candles? She looks beautiful! - Who's the blonde? - I don't know. Why? - She looks great. - What's wrong with you? - Don't I know you? - Of course not. - Got a car? - No. But I know how to flag down a cab. Hey, I didn't mean what I said. - Stop. I'm leaving. - Going home? - I'm going, but not home. - What's up? She's using you to make me jealous. And so you want to come with us? Hey, girls, we're having fun here! She's with me, and she's coming home with me. Okay, don't behave like you're straight. Come on, Camille. Leave it. You're not my nanny! Leave me. Stay with your wife! How do I put up with you? You're right! Go away! Sorry, I was coming on a bit strong, but... You're all over me to make her jealous, then you drop me. You're a real bitch! Want some more? You're crazy. - Aren't you capable of leaving me? - What are you talking about? You want to have your cake and eat it too! Well you can't have the cake! It's over! Leave me alone! - I don't see things like you do! - I'm not strong enough, understand? Isabelle is. That's why you'll stay with her. All this truth and honesty-- I can't handle it! You don't give a damn about me. You don't care if I am sad and alone. Stop it. You're being hysterical! You don't love me, Camille. That's what it is. Yes, I do. What do you want to drink? What will you have? It's my round. It's cool. It's really cool. Thanks. Camille. Pleasure, Camille. Have you got your drink? Yes, and the rest. Cheers! What are you celebrating? The end of being single. Here's to that! You're in good hands. What a mess! She's thrown up all over herself. It's disgusting! Okay, help me get her into bed. Shit, she's heavy. Really, your friend... Wait! Not so fast. Give me a hand to undress her. Hey, shall we have her? No, with Camille you must never go back! Hold on. You didn't... It was a long time ago. So how was it? - I don't really remember. - No, really. Good. I knew it. She is lucky to have you. She's unhappy. "She's unhappy, she's unhappy." She drives us mad. - When was that, then? - That's enough! I'll clean up. And you think that's funny! Where are you going? Hi. I came as soon as I could. You heard about me and worried? You left me at least 15 messages last night. I know you sounded out of it, but-- Go on, go on. Me too, I sometimes cry in the truck, naked and all alone. We're really similar, us two. That's why we keep bumping into each other. I was sure we would see each other again. It was weird when you called, but I wasn't surprised. I thought: "This is it. Now's the time!" I believe in destiny. Go on, cry. It's less water than if you pissed. I don't even know how I did the washing up! The washing up? We'll put them here. You know, a gay marriage... it's not the solution. We've got rights like everyone else. And anyway, I'd like it! And it might happen with the socialists! - What are you talking about? - Don't mention it. Nothing. That one is fantastic! It's great. Go for it. Look. Aren't you hungry? Not really. Shit! It must be the alternator. The fan belt must have had it. Have you got a stocking or something? I've just got my trousers. We could stop while you repair it. We'll leave tomorrow. Actual, I know a nice B&B. In Auxerre. They're friends. What do you think? Come on! Where's this B&B? - Where is it? - Auxerre! Don't you know Auxerre? The football team? It's the fan belt. It's shot. - Is Auxerre far? - No, we'll get going. - I'm going to buy some smokes. - We've got loads. - No, lights. - In the glove compartment. No, menthols. This is Alexis. Please leave a message. Alexis, it's Camille. I don't know why I'm calling. This is Alexis. Please leave a message. I know why I called. I'm in Auxerre, or I will be. At the station. Please, come. Please. Alexis, if you love me, come. How are you? I'm with my wife. Have you got a room with a big bed? - Yes, of course. - Great! - Shall I take the bags? - It's okay, thanks. What are you doing? I'm looking at the map. Where are we? We're right there. You'll take the bags. I'll be right there. - Are you free? - Of course. - Could you take me to the station? - Of course. I'm in a real hurry. Did the holiday with the family go well? - Not bad. - Coming back wasn't too bad? Yes, it was. We're getting divorced. No! I've fallen in love with another girl. Isabelle found out. And when we got back... she took the kids to her parents. Will you go back to the other girl? She's married. Well, she got married. Were you sleeping with my sister? Yes, I was sleeping with your sister. You can't smoke here! - Can't you see the sign? - Sorry, I had a craving. I've heard it all now. Do you know what you're doing? I should fine you, and call security! You're back in Paris? - Yes, I left my man. - Ben? Yes. Well, no. Well, yes. Anyway, it's a pleasure to see you. What? I told myself that if I saw you again? I'd slap you. - Why's that? - You know very well. Auxerre station, the last train. You were there? Stupid, isn't it? - Is it a girl or a boy? - It's a girl. - Who's the father? Ben? - I don't know. We'll see. Do you still love me? You're sure of yourself. We can't see each other again. I love you. - I love you. - I'm so happy. - I love you. - I'm so happy. Subtitles: ACKTARUS Translation: baaab
