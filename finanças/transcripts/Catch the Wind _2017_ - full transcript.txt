CATCH THE WIND A FILM BY GAËL MOREL WORKERS ON STRIKE NO TO OUTSOURCING ...a name that should be lost by now, but that some have trouble abandoning. I think it's great. No need to change it. Nadia? SHAME ON YOU Here you go, Nadia. Tonight, huh? Do you really plan to do this all day? I'll keep at it until you guys stop working. You'll tire before us. Every woman for herself, huh? Is that it? -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Édith Clerval? Yes? After you. Your factory will be shut next, so we need to end your contract with us. I'm terminated? Indeed. Ending a contract usually leads to getting laid off. That's the typical outcome. But we have other options. Our company is moving overseas, you can ask for a redeployment to our new location in Morocco. I'm obligated to mention this chance, but it isn't the best solution for you. Morocco? Yes. Production costs are way lower. I can move to Morocco? Like that? What do you mean? I mean... I can move there, just like that? And... there's nothing I need to do? You need a valid passport, of course, and the work contract. After that, it's out of my hands. I'd love that. You'd be interested? Yes. OK. In that case, you'll receive this form via certified mail. Complete it in 6 days and bring it back to me. In the meantime, you keep your job. You may be assigned a different job but you remain an employee. Accepting our offer means you won't get the severance package. They mention "areas of expertise". I passed a qualification in another field. Can I add that? Yes, you can. But we're asking you for your skills in textiles. conditioning, stitching, hefting. It's better to stick to your relevant skills. That's OK. That's fine. What's your name again? Clerval. Édith Clerval. That's a nice severance package, huh? You won't gain anything from moving there. It beats being alone and unemployed. Over there, I'll have a job. Yes, but you'll be paid like a local, with a slight adjustment. And all the other expenses: housing, food, you'll have to pay for that. You need a bit of money. I have some. OK, not much, but I have enough to settle down in Morocco. I don't understand. You have no capital. Take the severance pay, it's the wise thing to do. I have capital. My house! Look. You should follow the process I described to you, because you haven't properly judged this solution. I made my decision. That would be a grave mistake. Really. What is your motivation? I want to work. I wonder what I'l do when the factory shuts down. Any ideas? No. I'm not that skilled. I can read, write, count, nothing special: sums, multiplications, subtractions, the basics. Cooking. Same here. Driving and swimming. That's six things. Those six things are my entire skillset. Not even one for every finger. No. You know how to sew, too. You know how to cut hair. You know how to make babies. you know how to follow orders. Yeah. It's weird, you'd don't seem stressed. About what? About what's going on. Us shutting down. I have my own plans. Honestly, I don't get you. If you want to travel, get the severance pay. It's true, life's different over there, but... it's certainly not better than here. Are you hiding something? What? I don't know, maybe your medical didn't go well? You got some bad news, is that it? No, just making sure everything was fine for my redeployment. Everything's fine. Don't worry. But did you really think it through? With Islam? You're a woman. And life and work are really tough over there. It won't be a paradise. I know. I did my research online. With Islam, if you're French, it's different. As for the rest, I'll see. ...number 1678 for Paris-Gare de Lyon. In a few minutes... Sorry, I must be on the wrong floor. I took the stairs, I counted wrong. No, this is the third floor. Are you Jérémy's mom? Yes. I recognize you, I saw your picture. I'm Thierry, Jérémy's friend. -Nice to meet you. -Hello. Come in! He didn't tell me you were coming. I wanted to surprise him. He's not back yet. He's closing his office tonight. I was tasked with fixing dinner. We have guests. I'm sorry if I'm disturbing you. Are you kidding me? I'm glad you're here, he told me so much about you. Make yourself at home. I brought him his favorite dish: cardoon and marrow gratin and jam. Jérémy loves his desserts. They say boys that love sugar love their mom. You score another point. We finally meet. He was so upset you weren't at our civil union. Go ahead, Édith. That's him. What are you doing here? What is going on? I'm not involved. Get over it. I've some important news for you. What's going on? Is it bad? Your health? No. Don't worry. You're surprised, but not as much as I was. Believe me. I understand, I should've told you. I'm sorry, I... No, it was my fault. That's what I get for trying to surprise you. Dinner is served! Let's talk about this later, OK? Please do. Leave it, Édith. Our maid will take care of it tomorrow. But I don't mind. Mom, I'll set you up at the hotel next door. But I can sleep on the couch. It's not comfortable. It smells of stale food and cigarettes. But It's only one night. I can sleep on the couch. The look on your face tells me you hate me. Why? For the hotel or for everything else? Why did you lie to me? Are you ashamed of me? Is that why you hide me? What are you saying? Your civil union? Why did you lie to me? I didn't lie. I just never told you. Same thing. How could I have known you were going to surprise me? I never had any problem with your lifestyle once I found out you were... that you were into boys. I was never ashamed of you. I even sent you a letter that it wouldn't change a thing, that I wanted you to be happy and that's it. I replied that I didn't want to talk about my love life, or my sex life. It's got nothing to do with you, but... You'd rather I reject you like other parents do? Stop! Just tell me what you came to tell me. It must be important to make the trip. No. It's pointless now! Really. If you say so. Whatever! -Hello, miss. -Hello. I need you to sign here. Édith Clerval. Hello? Are you there? You must still hate me. For Easter, we're flying to Brazil. So I'll just come over for the holidays, but if you plan to come to Paris, let me know. Hello? Yes, I heard your message. I won't be there for the holidays. I'm going to Morocco. No, for work. I accepted to be redeployed rather than laid off. That's what I meant to tell you in Paris. No, it's too late to talk about it. Yeah, right. I'm out of my mind. No need to contact me. I canceled my cell phone plan. I'd love some. Thanks. I heard you accepted redeployment. How do you know? Everybody knows. You're the only one who did. We talked about it at the council. And? Nodoby gets it. You're doing them a huge favor. All that severance money. Talk to your comrades at the next meeting. I don't want to. Have you gone crazy? Did you think about Pierre? When he died, you said the factory caused his cancer, all those chemicals he breathed in. Now you hand them your severance on a silver platter? He must be spinning in his grave! Stop! Stop this right now. You don't know anything about my life. I'm just stopping you from making a mistake. What mistake? Can you tell me? Huh? OK. All right, Édith. I'm sorry. No, that's too easy. I'm not making a mistake! You're just mad I stopped believing your bullshit. "We're stronger together", and all that union crap. You bitch! Hey! What's going on? Nothing. It's just that bitch Gisèle! It's OK, calm down. We can't let her ruin our last evening. To us. To you. To your new life. Are you French, ma'am? Spanish? English? French. Come with me, ma'am. -No, thanks. -Come with me! No. Please. Sir, please. Sir! Please. Sir. Taxi, ma'am? You need a cab? Follow me! Please, ma'am, hop in. Hop in, ma'am. You're lucky, ma'am. Yesterday, we had the chergui, it's a cursed wind from the East. It makes us sad, ma'am. You crazy woman! Go away! Go away! What a crazy city. You'll see, there are as many crazies as cats roaming around. Will you be sleeping in this guest house? Yes. No stars, ma'am. Thanks. Are you the French lady? Édith? Nadia's friend? Yes. You must be Mina. Yes, that's me. Follow me. RECEPTION Thanks. The cab driver didn't scam you, I hope? No, I don't think so. He was very nice. He spoke very good French. You think you need a diploma to drive a cab? Ali will never get to drive cabs if he keeps this up. This is my son. Stop it, Mom! Hello, ma'am. Hello. Put some clothes back on. But, why? Practice starts soon. All right. This isn't the rugby pitch! Yes, but it's so hot in here. It's always too hot here. You need to buy an A/C. A/C or not, you need to respect my place of business! Bring up the foreigner's luggage. At your command. It is hot in here. Yes, this is the hottest day of the week. My mom always needs to be right. But, you'll see, it's cooler in this room. -Here you go. -Thanks Why would she come here for work? Weird. French people usually come here for a tan. What has the world come to? Global warming and now... -How's your day? -Awful. Can't bathe anywhere with all the construction going on. We're going to leave earlier and head south. I get it. I'm going to practice! So? How do you like your room? It's OK. "It's OK?" Is that all? Our most beautiful and spacious room! How does it work for rent? I told you by email. It was pretty clear. Yes. We agreed on the amount, but when do I pay you? Now? We have a saying here. "Those who go too fast are already dead." Are we far from the old station? The shuttle bus for the factory stops nearby. I'll check it out so I won't be late tomorrow. It's easy. I'll explain it to you when you leave. It's a 10-minute walk. I'd rather go now, to make sure. Nadia told me you could show me, that I could ask those things. Nadia should've tagged along, then, if you need a guide. It's not my job. Édith, can you come here? Kids, come here. Who can show her the way to the old station? -Me! -Me! Look, she has no money. But I'll give you 20 dirhams if you help me. -Are you interested? -Yes. He'll show you the way. -Go. -What about the money? 20 dirhams when you get back. No, 100 dirhams! Too much, I'll give you 30. 40. Deal. -Go. -Thanks. It's over there. It's over there, ma'am. -Come with me. -No, it's over there! Hey! Are you coming? Yes, ma'am. -Hello. -As-salamu Alaykum. Do you speak French? A little. How do I get to the textile factory? The textile factory, in the free zone. France is over there, this is Morocco. You work here, you work the olive fields... Wanna work? Wait. Ramzy! The foreigner's looking for work. Work here, ma'am? No. I want to take the bus. Bus? Yes. To go there. Got it. Can you show her? Listen up. See the harbor? The new one where they sell fish? There are bus stops there. Got it? Ma'am, he understood. He'll take you there. Thanks, goodbye. Ma'am, are you OK? Yes. Excuse me. Do you speak French? No, I only speak Spanish. Thanks. Ma'am, can I help you? I speak French. Yes, thanks. I'm looking for the buses headed to the industrial park. Do they stop here? No, it's over there. All right, thanks. You're welcome. Hey, kid! Come here. What are you doing? I'm showing her the way. -Are you a guide? -No. -Are you a thief? -No. You're a thief, you son of a whore! Why did you hit me? You bastard! Son of a bitch! Faggot! Son of a bitch! You're crazy! Be careful ma'am. It's dangerous around here. Is this the bus for the factory? No French. OK. Here? Get in. Thanks. Spanish? No. French. Don't keep your hair loose on the bus, it's not good. This is your workstation. I don't have the same job? Sorry? Speak up! I thought I'd have the same job I had in France. You wrote down "stitching" as one of your skills on the redeployment contract. Yes, but I don't know those machines. Najat will show you. It's easy. Half of the women here can't read or write, but they manage to do it. -Najat? -Hello, Mrs. Saraï. This is the new recruit, Edith. Hello. -The foreigner. -No! No, her name is Edith. Show her her station. Édith, please follow Najat. You, here! Can you show me? I don't know how it works. Can you help me, please? It's done, Mrs. Saraï. You didn't explain anything to her? I'm sorry. What do I need to explain? Everything. Follow me. Najat is the supervisor of this workshop. You're under her responsibility. She'll show you how the machines work. Édith, don't hesitate to contact me if you have any problem or question. OK. Najat, make an effort, will you? You, do same. Yes. Good! Fast! Faster! Eat? Not hungry? I am. But isn't there a cafeteria or a vending machine? I didn't pack my lunch. She's looking for the canteen. Why not a restaurant? What a princess! Wait. I have some leftovers. Come here! That's nice. I even have a fork for you. Thanks. You share your lunch with an infidel? With the money she's earning, she could feed you for life. If that were true, she wouldn't ride the bus. Tell her to cover up, Hadj Balaoud was not happy. What's she saying? You need to know. The shuttle bus belongs to an Islamic Association. How can I put it? What? It's forbidden for me too? No, not forbidden! But it's better to wear something on your head, like that lady. This one. Follow me. Hello, Ali. Good evening. Thanks. Tired? Yeah, but it's OK. My classes start late tomorrow, I can sleep in. What do you study? I'm at the Lycée français. I'd like to be a businessman after I graduate. That's good. I'm tired, too. Do you know where I could go eat? Not so expensive and not far? You can eat anywhere, but you need a strong stomach. The better restaurants are more expensive. Too bad. Good night. Édith? Are you OK? Yes. I'm OK. It's fine, I'm just tired. Hold on. Dada! Dada? Yes, Ali? Bring her to the kitchen. Heat up our leftovers from lunch. The poor lady's hungry. Your mother doesn't like having patrons in the kitchen. She isn't around. It's up to me. You'll take responsibility? I will. Come. Sit down. Thanks. TANGIER'S ART HOUSE MOVIE THEATER What's up, honey? No guests tonight, besides Édith. We had canceled bookings, though. What about you? How was the movie? Good. Why are you smiling? You went to the movies on your own? Dressed like this? Stop, you talk like an extremist. Just like your dad! If you're seeing someone, you can tell me. I didn't leave your father to get with another man. I hope so. There's nothing to hope for. It's my life, honey. I see you made yourself comfortable! Your son told me I could eat here. I told you I didn't want anybody eating here! Ali made me do it. That's not an excuse. I'm the boss around here. It's not her fault, it's mine. You understand Arabic now? No, but I guess that... Let's move on. No customer is allowed in here. Now, you know. By the way, I need your rent. Yes, fine. When do you need it? As soon as possible. Yes. How's your day? How are you? -Good? -Yes. -Yes. -Are you looking for someone? -Do you smoke hash? -No. Come with me. We can drink some alcohol. -No, I'm good, thanks. -Why, ma'am? Give me the money. I don't have any, I'm sorry. Please, sir! Don't do this! Please! Please! Hello Édith. Do you have the rent money? Édith? The rent money? No. I can't pay you. It's almost the end of the month. I need the money. Sorry. I'm going to bed. What? Before you go to bed, answer my question. I can't pay you right now. I don't want to be patient. You don't know my situation. I have bills to pay. Ask someone to wire the money. Don't you have friends or family in France? No, I have no one. If a guest wants the room, you'll have to leave, quickly. One month's rent is quite a sum! All right. I'll figure it out. Thank you for your hospitality. Yes, right, Moroccan hospitality. Did you read that in a book? I was mugged, he took everything. What's wrong with you? Shame on you! Why didn't she tell me she got mugged? I'm already giving her a discount! Did you see how you talk to her? She's sweet and you treat her wrong. Here, you do it. I'm going to town. It can be done. But the request needs to go through headquarters in Casablanca and then be greenlit by Paris. The joys of globalization. How long would it take? Three weeks at least. When do we get paid? At the end of the month, in a few days. There's no use asking for an advance, then? Yes, there is, for next month. But, not for this one, no. You're right. I'm sorry about the rent. I asked for an advance, but it's very complicated. I need to wait for my paycheck. Can you wait another couple of days? Yes, that'll do. Thanks, ma'am, that's sweet. Call me by my first name. It'll be easier. Yes, all right. You too. Sorry about last time, I got a bit angry. Canceled bookings due to the construction work. I have a short temper. By the way, is it true, what I heard about the veil? Ali told me you wear one. Does the factory make you? No, it's not the factory. I wear it on the bus. A religious association offers us transportation and... They're everywhere. Is it just on the bus? Not at the factory? No, I take it off at the factory and put it back on to get home. I think I have an idea! Those are the brakes, the throttle. You're good to go. I haven't ridden in ages. -Will that do? -Yes. There's a problem. My machine isn't insulated. Ouch! It stings. -Here. -No, no, no. Electrical problem. Here. -You. You speak French. -A little. Come and translate for me. I don't understand. The machine has a problem. I'm getting hit by jolts of electricity. That's a good one. She's a real pain! Yes, I can feel it. But, it's nothing. How fragile is she? I can't feel anything with my fingers. Get back to your station. Thank you, Karima. No. Go to the foreigner's station. But that doesn't fix the problem! No problem! You, problem! -Go! -What? Go back to work! Is there no maintenance? Is there nobody to fix those machines? Go! Back to work! Go! Our machines are old, but we're happy to have a job. Look. This must hurt like hell. I got burnt this morning. I didn't like it. All the machines have a problem? No, not all of them, but most of them. One day, I'll stop working here because my fingers will stop working. What if nobody will check the machines? Someone is. Najat. But she won't report the problems. She's afraid the bosses will replace her. Nonsense. If everybody's afraid of everybody else, nothing will change. It'll only get worse. Why don't you speak up? Because I'm scared, too. Does she want to try? She's asking if you want to try. What is it? Khol, it makes your eyes look less tired. Sure. I'd like to. It looks nice. -It's me, Ali. -Come in. We're having couscous tonight, Do you want to join us? Is Mina OK with that? Of course she is. She suggested it. I don't know if it's a good idea. Come join us! Get out of your room a bit. You'll see my mom is actually cool. It was her divorce that made her harsh. It was a struggle for her. When the Mudawana kicked in, it was tough. When what kicked in? The Mudawana, the family code our king reformed. It made divorce easier for women. My mother, jumped on the opportunity. She'd been dying to divorce my father. I didn't know that. This isn't France. Divorcing, even with the Mudawana, is still frowned upon. But I swear my mom's a good person. That's for sure. You're lucky to have such a great grandma. She's not my grandma. -She isn't? -No. She's not my mother. Actually, Chama grew up in our house. She married young and her husband banished her because she couldn't bear children. He just kicked her out. She had nothing. My parents took her in. And then she raised me and she helped me raise Ali. She's never left us. What about you? Sing me something. I don't know any songs. Come on! Come on! OK. I... There's a song I used to sing to my baby, to my son, when he was little. J'ai descendu dans mon jardin J'ai descendu dans mon jardin Pour y cueillir du romarin Gentil coquelicot, mesdames Gentil coquelicot, nouveau. Gentil coquelicot, mesdames Gentil coquelicot, nouveau J'en n'avais pas cueilli trois brins J'en n'avais pas cueilli trois brins Qu'un rossignol vint sur ma main Gentil coquelicot, mesdames Gentil coquelicot, nouveau Gentil coquelicot, mesdames Gentil coquelicot, nouveau I can't remember the rest. Bravo! Everybody get to your stations! I'm really sorry. Édith! Get back to work! Get off my back. It's not that much. Not even a meter. I need it for pockets on the dresses I make. And this fabric is very expensive. I have a sewing machine at my place. When I get home from work, I alter garments and I make stuff to sell it. I'm very talented. I didn't say anything. I'm just worried you'll get caught. Don't they search your stuff? Don't worry. Najat decides who gets searched. And Najat likes me. She does? She's capable of liking another person? She knows I take fabric, but she never said anything. With you, it's different. She's a bit harsh. She had a fiancé who left for France. He was supposed to fly her over once he'd found a job. But he never came back. He got married in France. It's not my fault. You're French. And you've been here for two months. Najat doesn't get how you can live on your pathetic wages. That wasn't the reason you came to Tangier. She thinks it's a weird thing to do. Let's say I just felt like catching the wind. The wind? Édith, if I can't double my pay with the sewing work I do from home to feed my seven brothers and my mother, I'll have to whore myself out. You've never been to a hammam? Really? Never. You're gonna love it. This one is very nice. It's clean, they give you towels... The only thing I don't like is their black soap. But we'll buy our own. Come on. OK. Let's go. Listen, stay close to me. We're entering the Medina, let's not get separated. Your friend is tense. Her vacation isn't relaxing her. She's not a tourist, she works here. Poor thing! Her back is all knotted up. Where does she work? In a textile factory, in the free zone. Congrats to her! First French woman to do so that I've ever seen. -Life is tough. -Yes, that's true. What are you guys saying? She thought you were tense for a tourist. I said you were here working. She was right about my tense muscles. It's true that work here isn't easy. I feel drained, completely tense. Don't you want to go home? What do you mean? Back to France. Are you out of your mind? After everything I did. Anyway, wherever I am, I got nothing to lose. Here, I'm not as lonely as I used to be. Having a job is important to me. I can't not be working. I dream of a life without work. I got that from my father. He never missed a day of work, even when he was sick. He'd load up on aspirin. Fever and sore muscles never stopped him. What was your life like in France? What did you do in the evenings? Not much. I cooked. I loved that. But, as I was alone, I lacked motivation. Nobody's waiting for you in France? Nobody at all? There are people I care about, and who care about me, but are they waiting for me? No, I'm not so sure about that. What about your son? We're not so in touch anymore. He doesn't even know where I am. Really? -He has no way to contact you? -No. What if he needs to talk to you? How does he do it? Lots of stuff happened since I went silent, which I regret now. I imagine how worried you must be. I'm well, don't worry. And I'm starting to love my new life, here in Tangier. I still need a bit of time to settle down so I can host you properly in the future. I miss you and I can't wait to see you again. Kisses. Get out of the way! Back to your stations! Go! Where's the foreigner? I don't know. I saw her with Mrs. Saraï. Is that true, Karima? She didn't tell me. She's your friend! Didn't you tell her not to disturb Mrs. Saraï without going to me first? I'm getting tired of her act. It's not my job to monitor her. Hello! Hello! You're already up? Yes. Can you let me fix lunch for you guys? But it's the weekend, isn't it? Don't you want to rest or go for a walk? No, I love cooking. I find it relaxing. How are you gonna manage? Nothing works around here. Don't worry. OK. OK, I'll get some groceries. All right. -See you later. -See you later. 12 dirhams. You almost lost your eye! Oh, my God! Mina, is everything OK? Look at him after a rugby match! Édith, you ought to be asking me. I'm the one who got hurt. What about me? My heart bleeds when I see you like this. OK, calm down. I'm with my friends. You gotta stop playing this barbaric sport! We're not barbarians! Get up! Take care of them, Dada! Look at the state he's in because of you! Get me the arnica tincture, it'll work better. Eat slowly! You need to savor your dish. See how he's stuffing himself? He's not savoring it. I eat quickly because it's so good. It's your fault, Édith, You cook too well. I'm happy to hear you like it. My son is the man of my life. I mean, not one of the first ones, but the latest one, for sure. Luckily, he doesn't look like his father. Do you still see him? No, are you crazy? He got remarried. He went to live in Spain about six years ago. I've had no news since. At first, I was worried that he'd try to get custody of Ali, that he was gonna steal him from me. But now, I hate that he doesn't give a shit. He doesn't seem to miss him. Quite the opposite. You're son's a nice boy. Yeah, that's what worries me. You see over there? That's Spain. So close? One day, he'll feel he has to go see his father. Who knows what will happen? Mrs. Saraï. I heard there were problems with those machines. -Who said so? -That's not the issue at hand! When was the last overhaul? They happen regularly. Can you be more precise? Often. When the maintenance crew comes. You oughta know since they come when you call them! Show me the faulty machine. It's this one. Bitch. Let me see this machine. And check all the other ones, as well. Everybody take a break! All of you! Now! You shouldn't have done that. You disappointed me. Last warning. There won't be a next time. Oh, no, what's going on? Spring cleaning? Yes, if my mother could see her kitchen all tidied up, she might find the motivation to do something with it. She's lucky to have you. You help her a lot. That's normal, she's my mother. Was your son like that, too? When we were close, yeah. But not lately. Why? Did you have an argument? No, not really. He went his way and I wasn't really part of his life anymore. Sometimes I think about the day I'll leave this place. Especially my mother. Seeing your son leave is... You can't imagine how much I miss him. Especially when I see Mina and you. It brings back memories. I'm really impressed, especially with you. You're so generous and mature. And yet you're so young. I don't feel young at all. In fact, I'd love to spend my nights partying, drinking, meeting girls. That's how I imagine France's youth. Free. Here, it's too complicated. I'd love you to take me there someday. We need to check with Mina, because she's gonna hate me for it. Yes, but one day, I'll leave and I'll lead my own life. And it'll happen without her, so... When my son moved to Paris, I was in such pain that a friend cheered me up, telling me I raised him well, that I'd given him all the tools to succeed. That's it. That's what you should tell my mom. I know how tough it's going to be for her. But it didn't cheer me up at all. It's the way he left that really hurt. He wanted to get away from our home, from me. The day you leave, you need to explain to your mom you're not doing it to hurt her, you're doing it for you. For you own life. You, wait. Najat! The foreigner stays with you. Traitor! She was stealing and you never told me anything. I didn't know. Please don't fire me! Shut up! After my report, you'll be fired. Don't come back here. Bring the foreigner in. That's not mine! You, French woman. Go to Mrs. Saraï! I said go to Mrs. Saraï! I don't have a job now, and it's your fault. Why did you do this? Go away! There's no union? Nobody to defend us? You're not in France. Plus, Najat is supposed to play that role. What? I have to apply the punishment, you were caught red-handed. I swear it wasn't mine. Someone must've opened my locker and placed the fabric in my bag. I don't know. As for Karima, Najat used to let her get away with stealing fabric. I'm sure you're right, but how to prove it? Nobody will take your side against Najat. This is how it is. And even if I wanted to change the way things work, I couldn't. You'll receive your letter of dismissal next week. However, the hours you've worked this month will not be paid due to the theft. No way, I need this money. The best I could do was call it "gross professional misconduct." But you can't do this. I need this job. -It would be like... -I'm really sorry. You no longer work for us. Back off! You, hop in. You too. How are the kids? You. The rest of you can leave. You came. Hop in. You, get off. Please. Get off the truck! Come on! I have kids. We all do! Get in. Come on! You're still here? Get lost! You can go now. Catch! Too bad. Sleep here. Ma'am. Ma'am? I'll be OK. Go back to work! Ali. Madam! Madam! Édith! Édith! That's him. I think that's him. Jérémy? -Yes? -Hello. We're the ones who called Nadia to get your number. -Hello. -Hello. This is my mother, Mina. I'm Ali. We found her lying in the courtyard after she fainted. We were scared, so we brought her here. They kept her, that's why we called you. Good call. OK, we're off. Second door on the right. -Thanks a lot. -Goodbye. Mom? Why did you leave? You can't imagine how much I blamed myself. It got me thinking about stuff. When I moved to Paris, and you went to the station with me. Remember? You never made me feel how tough it would be for you to be alone. On the contrary, you were smiling. Did you want me to leave with a light heart? How could I have forgotten how much I cared about you? OK, I know I've been very stupid at times. I'm not the perfect son, that's for sure. You can't go on like this. It's over. I saw the doctors. You're leaving tomorrow. We're going back to France. We'll never lose each other again. This is all her stuff? Yeah. Where are you staying tonight? A hotel, near the fortifications. You're right, the view's nicer over there. No, it's nice here, too. It's just that we'll be closer to the hospital. You know, I'll miss your mother. I enjoyed having her around. I hope she gets better. She should. The doctors are confidant. They say she could've left today. We'll keep in touch with you. Will you be coming back tomorrow before you leave? No, why? I'll already have her luggage. What time is your plane? 12. I'll pick her up from the hospital at nine. We won't have much time. Yeah. See you later. Pull over. Mom? You can't sleep? No. Are you feeling restless, too? You don't need to come over so often, you know? I'm feeling better now. It's not a chore. I'm happy to come over. Even if you get better, I'll keep coming. You don't have to. You're obviously bored around here. Well, it isn't like Paris. It's too silent, especially at night. Every little noise wakes me up. You were always a light sleeper. When you were little, on weekends, I wouldn't dare get up. I was so worried the noise I'd make would wake you up. Sometimes, I'd stay in bed till noon. Looks like it's all over now. This house will always be empty from now on. Why are you saying this? Look, we're here. It won't change anything, I'm sure. I went through your file. For cooking or factory positions, the jobs have left the region. Unless you're prepared to travel. All I can offer nearby is a nursery assistant job, but it doesn't start right away. The video is so clear today that I feel you're right here. That would be nice. I miss you guys. Hold on, I need to show you something, Édith. What is it? Check this out! Wow. This is great! Did you see the walls? Yes, congrats! I wish my mom were as happy as you are, but she was right. No banker is willing to give her credit. That's what I was calling about. Call Mina. Mom! 2.52 and 1.5 m. We'll go with double glazing. -Is everything OK? -No problem. -And here? -19 mm. Go ahead. So, Édith, no regrets? We could also stop now. No, I've been thinking about this for so long. That much? It's a nice house, though. Yes, but not when you're alone. OK, you win. Let's keep looking. What are you thinking about? What's next. I can't wait. You couldn't imagine. Working in a kitchen. Setting up a restaurant with them in Tangier. Don't get too excited. They look great, but... They are great. Probably, but business is business. You need to let me handle the contracts. All right? CATCH THE WIND CATCH THE WIND
