Baisho Mitsuko Ikebe Ryo Screenplay by Kuramoto Sô Production by Shundo Koji & Hashimoto Keiichi Cinematography by Nakazawa Hanjiro Art Direction by Igawa Norimichi Music by Ciari Claude Editing by Horiike Kozo Directed by Furuhata Yasuo why didn't you tell us? I didn't want to bother anybody. That's sounds like you. Anyway welcome back. It's been such a long time. But you still look the same. In fact, you look more handsome. Oh, don't tease me. How old are you now? I'm 46. 46... really. I guess so. You've been away for 15 years. - Tachibana, bring that. - Yes. I have a welcome home gift for you. - Where is Yasa? - Minami is taking care of him. Oh he is? He is a very smart man. His business is doing well... Oh, where is the boss? We are not the old school gangs. How was the auction? There was? How much? Oh really? 15,000,000 for munch! Wasn't there anything of Chagall? - It's this way. - It'll be expensive. Don't worry about it today. Thanks, dad. - Shall we eat dinner? - OK. Right there. How you've been, uncle? I received the money for school and the birthday gift. I love the beautiful pen. All my friends envy me. I'll treasure this pen. I am writing this letter at a café listening to Tchaikovsky. It's been breezy today. It snowed three centimeters a day before yesterday. The city is beautiful when it is covered by snow. I don't think you can even imagine. Isn't it the middle of summer in Brazil now? May I take your order? Coffee. Is there a café that plays Tchaikovsky in Brazil? Would you like to request any music? Tchaikovsky please. It's playing now. Welcome home. Did you hear anything? They're waiting at Kainantei. Mr. Minami. I'm so happy. I didn't believe this would happen. Long time no see. I'm so happy. Mr. Kanno is still the same, too. Yokohama will go back how it was in the old days! I'm glad. Anyway let's eat first. You're the man, Mr. Kanno. Toryukai is in good hands. Can't find people like you these days. The boss Sakata must be very happy. Got it, got it! Just feed us please! You don't understand. You really don't understand. There is nobody like him. Come on. Hurry up! You don't understand. Thank you for everything. Welcome back! I'm sorry there is nothing in the apartment. The place is luxurious for me. No way. Did you go to see the boss? I just did a while ago. He's aged, hasn't he? He gave me a present. A painting? He is crazy about paintings nowadays. Everybody doesn't know what to do with him... She is looking forward to seeing you. The Matsuoka's. Did you tell her about my return? I shouldn't have? She grew up to be a nice girl. You should meet her. I'll arrange it. She is really looking forward to it. I killed her father. How can I see her? What do you mean? You helped her all these years. It's not me. It's because of you. Don't say that. I was just a messenger. Don't be silly. You should just go see her once. I'll tell Takeda to take you. Do you remember him? The one who was in our karate club. He's in our group now and works for me. He takes her to school, too. Hey. Yes? Is the gambling house still in business? Hey, Mr. Kanno. - When did you come back? - Yesterday. Welcome back. Please enjoy yourself now. Who's that? The one Mr. Otani greeted? You don't know? He is Kanno Hideji... What! The famous slayer hide. He killed Matsuoka 15 years ago who betrayed our boss and... Was locked up 15 years for it. So Mr. Minaken is... He worked under Mr. Kanno. So did Mr. Minami and Mr. Yamamoto. Mr. Kanno. Welcome back! I didn't know. You look good! - Yes... ah... - Your ride is here. See you soon. Welcome back! Forget about European cars. American cars are the best, right? - Still, the French model isn't bad. - They're only for punks. But the boss has a Mercedes. That's a German car! You're so ignorant! I recommended it to him. But... What? You said there is only one Lincoln in Japan... Tamaoka Osamu owns the same model. - Tamaoka Osamu? - The actor. What? You were deceived by the dealer again. You idiot! It only looks like mine! Really? Mr. Tamaoka told me it's the same model. - 1978! - Yes, his car is 1978. So you do have the same car as Tamaoka. You're so quiet. Bring him another drink! Do you only drink? Aren't you interested in a woman? You told me there is only one! What? You shouldn't lie! You need to destroy his or take mine back! Stupid! Of course I need all my money back! Bring it! Bring it now! I'll beat you up if you don't bring it! Don't give the microphone to him anymore! Who are you? You look familiar. You're from Ishii? Mr. Kanno. You can come out how. Mr. Minami has been taking care of me well. My name is Takeda. This guy is from Ishii, who used to work for Matsuoka. The man you killed. He just tried to show off. Mr. Minami told me to come and greet you. I'll come pick you up at two in the afternoon tomorrow. I'll take him back with me. Sorry for the trouble. Hey. Yes? Go easy on him. Yes. That's her. The one on the very left. Shall I call her? No, don't. That punk Takahata Tetsuji is one of Ishii's pawns. Ishii used to work for Matsuoka, the one you killed. He's obsessively trying to get revenge. He's stupid not knowing the truth of why his ex-boss was killed. Hey, Ishii. Yes? You shouldn't have anything against to Mr. Kanno. I don't! Believe me! Matsuoka betrayed our group. So he was killed. Yes. Do you understand that? I understand. Mr. Kanno, please believe me... It's OK. I'm really sorry. And that stupid man sends his finger for his apology. I told him he's an idiot. We don't do this anymore. We can't even make a pickle out of it. He watched too many Toei movies. He told me that he asked his doctor friend... To cut it off under anesthesia! I don't believe those young punks nowadays! Japan doesn't have a bright future. Excuse me! My dentist told me I have to have full dentures top and bottom! Did everything settle? Yes, it did. I'm very sorry. - Hey, Hideji. - Yes. How did you like the painting? Do you like it? Very expensive, you know! I gave him the Takatsu Saburo's painting for his return gift. That must be very expensive. I saw the paint on the canvas was an inch thick! Hideji. Michio. When did you get out? A day before yesterday. Is that right? You look good! What do you mean! I want to quit already. Do you work on this side how? I teach kendo in Tokyo. What is your rank? I'm fifth rank. Fifth! - Is my mother here? - Yes. She's waiting for your arrival. There's many things I want to tell you, Hideji. Mr. Kanno, do you have a minute? Thanks for yesterday. I wanted to talk to you. Mr. Take is waiting with Hanai for you. I thought Hanai retired from the group already. Yes he did. Now he owns a small restaurant. Welcome home! Welcome back! It seems like no trouble on the surface. But the truth is full of trouble. The Kansai group has their office opened up right in our territory. They made a dummy company, but... We know it's them. Saegusa Nobuyoshi is the boss... He used to be a secretary of Nagano. He's quite intelligent. There are five to six men and they are all thugs. They already started to bother us. They made some trouble with our guys yesterday. They are trying to provoke us. They're waiting for us to get mad. Our men are getting impatient. But the boss is stopping us. He said not to retaliate against their actions. Our men are getting so irritated. Why aren't we doing anything about it? Our boss has an idea. He knows their real intention. You know Komuro Takeo, right? The righteous tycoon. The man tried to approach our boss many times. It's the same old deals. A merger of gangs. To make it short, they want us to join with them. They actually want us to work under them. Our boss has been refusing all this time. But there are some members who are willing to merge. They don't believe in fighting for territory anymore. They think it's time for mutual cooperation. It's just like fifteen years ago. Matsuoka believed in a merger... But he went too far and was killed. It's the same thing again. Some of our men think it's better to join with the Kansai group. They don't agree with boss. For an easy life... What matters the most is peace, not pride. He has a good voice. But this is too much. He's been singing for half an hour already. Hey, shall we stay? I'm done. I have to see the results of my son's exam tomorrow. - What exam? - For an entrance exam of Keio university. Oh wow! You must've bribed them. You want me to slap you? See ya! Don't drink too much energy drinks! Hey. I'll go talk to him. Don't make a fuss. - Hey. - Yes? - Make a Brandy and water for him. - May 1? I can't just drink these energy drinks. Hey, bartender! One order of Brandy and water here! What? What's going on? He dared me to take the Mike away from him if I wanted to. Hey, let's go. Your Brandy... Where are you going? Hey, come again! I can sing, can't I? Taxi! We have to go home. Taxi! Over here! It's coming. I'll take the Mike! Hey. Welcome back. You're in the wrong room. Ishii from Kakinuma group sent me here. He wants to make up for the punk trying to get you. I'm the apology gift for you from Ishii! Let me have some beer. I already had one, though. Are you a gangster? Did you mutate your penis like most of them? I don't like it. It only hurts. But I'll do my best to make you happy. OK, cheers! Um! Taste good! Let's get started! Are you ready? Here. I already got paid. You can go. Don't worry. I'll tell Ishii you did your job well. Did I do something wrong? No, you didn't. I just want to be alone. Please don't feel bad. I'm actually a little tired, so it's better for me! Maybe some other time. See ya. Good night. Tell Ishii I was good! Bye-bye. Yes, the police are here. Mr. Ishii is taking care of the situation. Yes, Mukai turned himself in this morning. Three cars from Kansai have just arrived at their office. Hello, hello? Hiro. There're 15 to 16 men arriving at shin-Yokohama. So the whole thing started from a fight for a microphone? I never wanted the Mike. Don't lie! You looked so mad. That's why Mukai killed him. You can't just kill somebody over a Mike! It's ridiculous! It's your problem that you have to sing a lot! How can you sing without any drinks? Mr. Yamabe, there is a call for you. I knew this would happen! They're always looking for an excuse to provoke us. Now they'll come after us. Don't say that so easily. Mr. Nakai, there is a call for you. - Who is it? - Komura. He sounds arrogant. Komura? I have no idea who that is. I asked him Komura from where, but he said you should know. It must be Komura Takeo. Here he comes. The story is going just like the scenario. I'm flipped. What's up? My son... he was accepted to Keio university. Where's your car? Where to? I'll go check on the town. I'll come with you. Don't worry. Uncle, thank you very much for the violin. Mr. Minami brought it to me yesterday... I was so happy that I slept with it. It's raining here in Japan now. I'm writing this letter trying to imagine your face... I'm alone in this world, so your existence is so important. It's so hard to put it in words how important it is to me. Mr. Takeda told me that... You might come back to Japan. Is it true? If it's true, I'll be too excited that I won't be able to sleep. When would that be? Are you really coming back? Hey, I heard you're supposed to be an uncle in Brazil. What's she like? How old is she? Be quiet! Damn him! If she is 15 or 16, she's old enough for you. I envy you... you can have her soon. I'll be waiting. I'll be waiting for the day I can meet you. I'll be wishing from the bottom of my heart... I'll be waiting... The boss wants you to go with him. He's leaving for Tokyo, soon. Komura's arbitration will be at a restaurant in Akasaka. It cost me too much! Hey. Yes. How did Komura know I had a Chagall? The story was exactly how I predicted. He proposed a union with the Kansai group. If we disagree, they'll attack us. They're threatening us. How's our boss? He tactfully declined. He sure has guts. He ended up giving the Chagall, though. I suspect one thing. It seems like Mr. Nakai's been secretly meeting with Saegusa. It came to me when I was introduced to Saegusa. Maybe Komura's been doing the same thing, too. Didn't I tell you? There're some members who want to unite. I think Mr. Nakai is one of them... Tachibana. Yes? That's enough. Mr. Nakai is our senior. Yes... Besides... Yes? He is the man of men. He told me once... "I don't care about the law... "But... "I can't go against god". He'll never betray his boss. I'm sorry. Please forget what I said. Thank you for your letter. So you can't come to Japan... I'm so disappointed that your return has been postponed. I'm writing this letter at the same café called "concerto". I stop by here every Thursday after my violin lesson... And write a letter for you. They play classical music here. They're playing a violin concerto by Tchaikovsky right now. I love this piece. Have you noticed? This letter is a little different from the others. I stopped calling myself "Yoko". I'll be 17 soon. I'll be 17. I have so many things I wanted to do when I turned 17. First... "Piano concerto by Tchaikovsky" Did you meet my son, Michio? Yes... He scolded me. He said I should have opened up an office for you. He said you and Minami are the only ones I can trust. So... are you willing to manage one? Actually... I'm thinking of... You want to have a normal life? Yes... I had a hunch. Now might be a good chance for you. Yokohama doesn't seem like it's at peace and... Things don't work the way it used to be... Let me think about it little more... I have a favor to ask you. What is it? If I die... Don't talk that way... My group will fall apart. I don't care if it does... Some may side with the Kansai group. Others might fight each other. They can do whatever they want or wish, but... I don't want my son to get involved in any of that! Can you please watch over him? He is so short tempered... But he'll listen to you. Please keep an eye on him for me. I understand. That's my wish. Yes. I'm so tired of the fighting and bloodshed. I'm happy just looking at paintings. Yes? I love Chagall, especially his oil paintings. I'm seriously in love with it. You saw it at my house. That Chagall painting is the best. It's not the price. Chagall is good... Hello? Oh, it's you. What? Where? Where is he going? Maybe to an art dealer. He said something about Chagall. Where is it? It's at Oiso. Oiso? In the villa of a politician. I'm not supposed to say his name. You'll know soon enough if you go there. They want to sell? I guess so. It's a rush but his widow wants to sell it. Is it possible for me to look at it? Are you going there? Yes, I'll leave now. I've been waiting for you. Thank you. To the garage please. It's absolutely superb! Hello, thank you for waiting. This is Yoko. Hello? Hello? Hello? Who's this? Uncle? Uncle? It's you isn't it? Are you back in Japan? Hello? It's you, uncle... Is this Hideji? This is Minami. The boss has been murdered. He was stabbed all over. So was Saniji, his driver. The victim was Sakata Yoshio. The boss of the Toryukai group. The weapon was a sharp object... Can you repeat? A sharp object. There were more than ten wounds in his body. Come out, Saegusa!! I'll kill you! Come out! Calm down, boss. Don't! Hold it! This is not a show! This is not a show! Our boss was killed! Leave me alone! Our boss was killed! Toryukai boss murdered! Body found at harbor! Driver found slain, too War between Kanto and Kansai? Police watch for Toryukai vengeance Killer turns self in the killer was a truck driver and killed because of road rage. Killer was a truck driver murder has nothing to do with Kansai group? Japan's future is hopeless. Saegusa is here. Komura and other leaders are with him. We can't make a scene now! Please hold back the young men! Don't! Please calm yourself! When did you get out? About a month ago. Do you live in Yokohama? Yes. You returned to your nest. I found out where your mother was. Is she alive? No. She's dead. She died two years ago. Where was she? In Niigata. Niigata? She was working as a maid at a shabby motel in the suburbs. I went there. Niigata? Yes. They said to take her belongings. It was a small bundle of daily necessities. That's all. And a saving account book. Look how she deposited her money. Only 500 yen, 700 yen or tiny amounts at a time. It makes me feel sad. She wasn't with that guy? She was dumped a long time ago. She was still a waitress until 1965. Don't you think it's time for you to have a normal life? They decided to call a truce with the Kansai group. Influential bosses came to sort things out. Nakai and Kakimura were for the merger anyway. Michio and Yamabe were opposed to it until the end... But they gave in to avoid trouble. Times have changed, after all. Yesterday, I was surprised to see... The nakai guys already drinking with the Kansai guys... They were singing and having fun together. I'm planning to leave... I was telling this to the boss before he died. Think it's good timing? I think so. You can have this place back anytime. I'm planning to go away somewhere. To where? An instructor at the prison in Asahikawa will find a job for me. What kind? Wood working. I learned how in the prison. I'll find a job in Asahikawa. Hey... It's been a long time. Have a seat. Is Mr. Takeda in? Takeda is out now, but... Isn't my uncle back in Japan? Why? I got a call. A call? The person hung up without saying anything... But I know it was him. You were mistaken. Really? Any message for Takeda? I just wanted to ask him about that. Excuse me. Did you call her? Nice girl, isn't she? I almost told her who you were. - Do you want some? - Don't do that. It's OK. - Give me some. - Cut it out, Satomi! I wonder why? What did you say? I was only thinking about that before... I always wished to eat with her... I was planning to meet her when I got out... I don't know why I was thinking that I'd be able to see her... Hey, older brother. Will you help me? Let me hold on to you. My heel broke off. I'm glad you remembered me. OK. Thanks. See you. Older brother... Are you Mr. Kanno? Then you should know Mizue. You know her, too? I knew her when I was in the Kansai area. Kansai? We worked at the same place for a while. Is she well? Want to meet her? I know her story! Where did you work with her? At a whore house. At a whore house? She taught me all the tricks. She was working hard but she was 33 when she started. She used to complain that she was too old... But she was very popular with her cute look. We're both from Hokkaido. You were in prison at Asahikawa, right? She always wanted to go to Asahikawa. She said she wanted to go up north but ended up down south. Will you find out where she is now? Do you want me to? Yes... OK. I will. I heard you guys decided on a truce with the Kansai group. Don't believe that. It's only a show. I'll get the one who killed my father. Hideji, will you help me? Have you mentioned it to anybody? I don't trust any men in our group. You're the first one. Don't do it. Your father told me to tell you you're not a gangster... I'm not asking you for an opinion. I'm asking you if you're in. I'm afraid it's too much of a responsibility for me. I see. I understand. That's all I wanted to know. - Michio... - I'm not upset. Don't worry. I'll get going. Yoko, it's been a long time... I'm not sure how to start this letter... Actually, I've been lying to you all this time. My real name is Kanno Hideji. Ever heard this name before? As a matter of fact, I'm neither your uncle nor in Brazil. I was in Asahikawa prison for 15 years and I'm a murderer. You probably know who I am now. I was the one who killed your father. You were only three years old then... Did you wait long? What's wrong? Are you OK? Hey, I saw a man talking with Mr. Minami at his office. Who was he? What was he like? He was a tall, quiet type person. Isn't he my uncle? Why? Why did you think it's him? I just had a feeling. Somebody called me at my dorm. Called you? The person soon hung up. Are you sure he isn't back in Japan? I told you he isn't. Hey, that hurt! You can't hit and run! You're putting up a big front, huh? Come with us this way. You got some guts. Are you a member of a gang? Ken from the Kansai group was beaten badly. They're all furious. Who did it? Kanno Hideji. Welcome. Go tell them. - He's in the back. - Got it. Well done. Will you come with me? It won't take long. Just come. What if he goes? Do you know where you are? Mr. Sakata. He used to be my boss. Please leave. Really? I didn't know. I understand. Let's go. I'm sorry to put you in that situation. Since when are you a big shot like that? I thought your boss, Mr. Yamabe hates them. When did you make friends with them? When can we work for you? How long must I stay under Mr. Yamabe? I want to work for you! But because I'm placed under Mr. Yamabe, I... Take... What's going on? Let's have a few drinks. Dear instructor Sato of Asahikawa penitentiary. Thank you for everything you've done for me. Well, you once mentioned that you can offer me a job... Is it still possible if you can help me on that? Got a Chagall? What? I said Chagall! Chagall. Chagall! Chagall? The one you tried to sell to our boss. Can we see it? The same one. Mr. Yamabe betrayed us to the Kansai group. The art dealer talked. Does anyone else know about it? No. Only the four of us and take. - Did take tell you this? - Yes. Don't tell anybody else. Especially to Michio. Mr. Yamabe was involved in the killing of our boss. He used the Chagall as the bait. Is that true? Isn't that right, Takeda? I thought nakai would be the one who would betray us. What the hell are you doing? Shut up! Don't just talk but get going! What about Michio? What do you mean? Didn't he approach you? You know? He plans to kill Saegusa... And Komura, too. He asked me to help him. What did you say to him? Should I refuse? Prevent him from doing it. We must stop him. He's the son of our boss, but he's not a part of the gang. He shouldn't get involved with any of this, right? I understand. And... About Takeda... What about Takeda? Is he formally a member of our group? Yes. He's been placed under me. Make him quit. Why? Tell him quit, unless he stops being with Yoko. I understand. A call for you, Mr. Minami. Excuse me. Are you drinking? You've gotten old and had a rough time. I'm having a rough time, too. My daughter is planning to get married this fall. My hair will turn white. Do you want some more beer? Well, it'll make you piss more. Michio is going to see Saegusa tomorrow. They invited him to a restaurant for a talk. He asked me to go with him. He plans to kill Saegusa right there. Did Saegusa call him personally? There was a go-between. As we suspected, it was Yamabe. They plan to kill Michio, too. Is this the Seishin dormitory? May I speak to miss Matsuoka Yoko? Thank you for holding, this is Matsuoka. Hello? Know who this is? Uncle! Yes. When! Where are you? Hello? I have to leave tomorrow. I'm in a rush. We'll meet the next time I come. Wait! I'll come see you now. Where are you? I'll write you a letter. Please wait. Hello? Where are you now? Good bye. What's wrong? Nothing. I was wondering these past three days if I should call you. Have you found out about Mizue? Yes. But it isn't very good news. She died in a fire. She was in Kyushu at that time. She was saying she wanted to go up north but ended up south. I'm feeling good today! Let's have fun together. I'm so sorry. While I was delivering the letters, I fell in love with her. I've been thinking of telling you... is it serious? Yes, it is. What about her? She loves me, too. Then there's no problem. Make her happy. - Boss... - Stop calling me that. Quit the gang if you want to make her happy. Promise me you will. Yes. Are you serious about this? Yes. If I ever hear that you're still a part of this... I'll never forgive you. Got it? Yes. Boss... Mr. Kanno, please meet her. She wants to see you. And... I have nothing to do with her. I've just been spending my life... To make up for what I did. Hello. It's me. OK. Dear Yoko. I'm sorry about last night. I'm not able to meet with you... I heard about you and Takeda. I think it's a wonderful thing. I saw Takeda for the first time. He seems like a nice guy. I wish the two of you happiness. Next time I come to Japan... Maybe one day... The first thing I'll do is to meet you. I'd like to see you then... Keep the way you're now, young and beautiful. Be a good wife. A lovely wife who's obedient to Takeda. If you still remember about your uncle... Uncle? You are, aren't you? I have no idea what you're talking about. You're mistaken. Mr. Yamabe sent me. Boss! Yamabe did? What for? Please don't go out today. We know Yamabe betrayed us. They're waiting. It's a trap. What did you say? I'm sorry, go back inside! What happened to Tagami and Kinoshita? Hey, Hideji. I'm in a rush. I heard Michio can't meet you. I had no choice. Can you please let me go? You've known me a long time... For my child... Please help me out. The end
