(lighthearted acoustic music) - [Ernie Harwell Recording] Well, here's a very important last half a ninth inning coming up. Nolan Ryan, on the verge of setting baseball history. Ryan has struck out every one of the Tigers batters at least once. The Tigers have had four walks, they've not had a runner since there were two out of the sixth inning when Gates Brown walked and here's Gates up again. He's walked twice, struck out once. Swing and a line drive to Maoli for the out. They are two down in the ninth. Seventeen strikeouts, is still the strikeout total for Ryan. He can tie the American League record if he can fan Norman Cash. He is one out away from a no hitter. Cash has struck out twice, one more out and Ryan has a no hitter. It'll be the second no hitter pitched against the Tigers this year. Norman, getting a new bat and I believe that's gonna be tossed out. Luciano does not want him to use that bat. Been ruled illegal by the plate umpire. So Norman gets a new bat, they are two down in the ninth inning. One out away from a no hitter, Nolan Ryan. (lighthearted music) - Perfect timing. - How was work? - [Jane] Great, you? - Usual. (lighthearted music) (clicks) (cutlery clinks) Thanks. - Oh yeah. I ran into Clark when I got home. He said to pop next door after dinner. Said maybe you can shoot some pool or something. I'll let you off of dish duty so you can go hang out a bit. - Oh, I don't know. Probably not tonight. I'll call him though, thanks. (crickets chirping) (paper rustling) - [Rachael] Hey babe, dinner? - Hey, you didn't have to stop, I coulda made something. - It's okay, I got Chinese. It's so dark in here. Come eat. How was your day? Sell anything good? - No, not really. - Oh, that's a bummer, I'm sorry. - Yeah, well, your brother did buy a whole lot of baseball cards that we can't sell so, business as usual. (computer mouse clicking) (door creaks) - Going to bed, handsome. - All right. - What are you doing? - Nothing, just looking at stuff. - Okay, well, I'll be inside. Don't stay up too late? - Okay, I won't. (footsteps tapping) (clicking) (crickets chirping) - All right, well I'm going to bed. Don't stay up too late. Maybe even join me before I fall asleep-- - Knock it off. Yeah, I'll be there, just give me 10 minutes. - 10 minutes? - Yeah. (lighthearted music) 10 minutes! - 20 minutes. (somber music) (clicks) (gentle music) (gentle music) - [Teague Answering Machine] Teague's phone, not answering. Call me back. (phone beeps) - Text Teague. Hey man, comma, autographed Norm Cash bat question mark. Worth it, question mark. Text me ASAP so I can call them, exclamation point, exclamation point. (phone beeps) - [Phone] Ready to send? (phone beeps) Consider it done. (footsteps approaching) - Do you have any idea what your brother is doing tonight? - No idea. - Guy sends me 40 text messages a day, except when I need him, I can't get in touch with him. - You and me both. - Really? - [Rachael] What? - Very subtle. - Just dreaming, that's all. - Such a stereotypical woman. - Hey, I can be a stereotypical woman. Just because I'm the breadwinner, doesn't mean I can't pick-- - Jeez! - Just kidding! I'll bread your winner. - Okay, I don't, doesn't even make sense. - I'm fine with the way things are. Working hard to make it work and that's all that matters. Doesn't matter how we're getting by. - Thanks. Sorry I can't contribute more. You can do way better you know? - Hey! Hate it when you say that. I'm here, you dumbass 'cause I love you, dumbass. Plus, when I was a little girl, all I ever dreamed of was being someone's sugar momma. - What is it with you and this sugar momma? - [Rachael] I'll sugar your momma! - [Grant] That's gross! (laughs) (birds chirping) (coffee dripping) - Hi, I'm calling about the Norman Cash bat I saw posted online. Do you still have it? Oh okay, great. (coffee trickling) Uh huh. Okay. Well, maybe I can come by around lunch time to see it? Yeah, I can hold. - Now what did ya find? - Oh nothing, it's a autographed Norman Cash memorabilia. - Sounds expensive. (Jane sighs) You know I love you right? - I know. - Anybody home? - Yeah, I'm in here. - Hey man, you gotta check out this chick last night. I totally took her-- - Shh, shh, shh! Hi, hi, is this Lois? Hi, I'm calling about the bat that you posted an ad for. Oh okay, did they already? Oh no, okay great, well I can come by today at noon if you're. Oh okay. Yeah that works, what's the address? Okay great, yeah, yeah, I totally understand. All right, thank you so much Lois. Okay, bye, bye. Oh, come on, man. (laughs) - Yeah, she was sweet. Hey, did you get any bites on that Marvel Golden Age lunchbox? - Nah, I told you, we gotta come down on the price, it's all beat to shit and there are tons of them out there. - Yeah, but it was signed by the man himself. - Doesn't matter, if there are tons of them out there. - Anything else? - Um. I got an email about the Barkley jersey but we're not gonna make any real money on it because of the tear and I just called about this bat. I texted you last night but as per usual, I didn't hear back from you. Right. - Yeah, you should totally buy it. - Yeah? You think it's worth something? - [Teague] Mm hmm. - You think you could make an actual profit off of it? - Mm. - Kinda desperate for something big here man. I'm not really upholding my end of the bargain. I want to show Rachael that this is actually doable. - Oh, I'll show you doable. - Oh man! Who does that? (door clicks) - Roy! Glad I caught you. - Oh, Mr. Webb. Hello, I was just stepping out for my lunch break. - Oh, well, I won't keep you. I just want you to know that tomorrow's two o'clock with Palmer-- - I completely understand, sir. - Just as long as you're prepared, that's all. - Oh I am, sir. - Counting on you. Are you going to that new Thai place everybody's talking about? - Oh, no, no, actually I was just gonna run a quick errand and maybe go see my father. - Oh, well in that case, I'll see ya back at the office. - Okay. (lighthearted music) (car door slams) (car engine revving) (phone rings) - [Roy Answering Machine] You've reached the voicemail of Roy Dalton, leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. (beep) - [Jane] Hey it's me, figured you be on your lunch break by now, if you're not working through it. Anyway, I'm out running some errands before my afternoon classes, just wanted to call and see how your day is going. I guess I will talk to you when I talk to you, okay? I love you. (beep) - [Rachael] Hey, it's me, we're on recess so I thought I'd give you a call. Cannot wait to tell you about this case. Anyway, I hope your day is going good and I love you and I will see you later tonight. Okay, bye! (beep) (car door slams) (lighthearted music) - Hey, are you? - I'm heading right here. - Me too. - Oh, right on. Are you here to see the um-- - The bat? - Yeah, the bat, okay, me too. I guess, let's check this thing out, shall we? (lighthearted music) (doorbell rings) (dogs barking) (door clicks) - Hello there, can I help you? - Uh yeah, hi. I'm here to see the autographed bat, we spoke earlier on the phone? - And me too. - Yeah, both of us. - Oh yes, please, come in. - [Grant] Thanks. - Came at the same time. Just a minute and I'll go fetch it. - Thank you. So do you sell a lot of stuff online? - Oh no dear, I had my nephew put this on the line for me. Here it is. My husband had a lot of this stuff, always with the baseball, you know? - So there's more of this then? - Oh no, this is the last of it. Hung onto it for a little while but you know, time to let go. - Looks legit. - Yeah, that's definitely his signature. It looks used. - Like game used? Like professionally? - How much are you asking? - How much are you offering? - I'll give you $200 for it, ma'am. - I can do 225. - Well, isn't this nice? - Okay, I guess 250. - 300. (sighs) - All right ma'am, I'll give you $400 for it. - All right, I can do 410. - 420. - All right, this is silly, man. Let's cut to the chase, what's the most you're willing to spend on this thing? (lighthearted music) - $500. - 525. - 550. - Okay, neither of us wants to let it go. We're both gonna have the same bank roll it seems so let's figure out a way to work this out. Let's figure out something fair. - How? - Rock, paper, scissors? - Excuse me? - Rock, paper, scissors, you know what it is. Loser walks away. - [Roy] That's ridiculous. - You got a better idea? - Okay, on shoot. - What? - Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. We throw on shoot. - Perfect, all right, let's go. (lighthearted music) All right, you ready? - Yeah. - [Both] Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. (phone ringing) - Come on. - [Both] Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. - Seems kind of weird that you're playing a kid's game for a baseball bat. Maybe you should be playing baseball for it. Hello? - Yeah, great idea, why don't we get a bunch of grown men together and play a game of pick up baseball. Winner will get the bat, how's that? - I have another gentleman on the phone. He says he'll come over right now with $650! - Damn it. Uh, all right, can you just have him hold on just one second? One of us is gonna get the bat, agreed? - Yeah, sure. - All right, we can figure out who later. Let's just make sure the price doesn't go up anymore. I have an idea. Hi, can I talk to him real quick, do you mind? Really quickly. Hey, yeah, sorry pal, bat got sold, thanks for calling. Okay, my friend and I have decided that we're gonna buy the bat collectively, okay? So it was 600? - No, the gentleman on the phone said $650. - Great, okay. You have 325 in cash on you? - Yeah. - All right, great, let's split it. Just so she doesn't sell this thing before we can figure this situation out. - Okay, well, who's gonna take the bat now? - Gonna take a guess that you don't think I'm trustworthy enough to do it. - Not exactly, and I sort of wanted to take it and show my father. - Well, I'm sorry about that but just 'cause you're all business doesn't mean you're more trustworthy than I am. All right, ma'am can we pay you now and then pick it up in like a day or two? - Yes, I guess I see no problem with it. I'm gonna get my money either way. - Awesome, great, can I, thanks. I just, I can't let this get away. That should be it all. All right, thanks again. We'll be in touch to pick it up. - I gotta get back to work. - Ah okay, so take my card and I guess, give me a buzz the second you get a chance and we'll figure a way to sort this whole thing out so that we're both happy. - Okay. - I'm Grant by the way. - Roy. - Nice to meet you, Roy. Well, it's a pleasure co-owning a bat with you. I guess I'll talk to you in a bit? - [Roy] Sure. - Sounds good man. You enjoy the rest of your day. - I have no idea what happened. - [Jane] You just gave money away for nothing is what it sounds like. - Yeah, it does. But his card seems somewhat legitimate. I'll call him after work and we'll sort it all out. - [Jane] I'm sure you will, what did the woman say about it? - She was sort of funny about it. She even implied that we should play an actual game of baseball for it. - Play baseball? Oh my goodness, you should, that's a great idea. - [Roy] What? - You guys should play a game of baseball. - Hey Roy, can you, oh. - Jane, that's ridiculous. - Why? Why is that ridiculous? When was the last time you did anything fun? You go to work, you come home, you lounge, rinse, repeat. I think it would be a really good idea for you to get outside and get some exercise. - And Webb needs the rest by three. - Oh okay. Sorry. I don't know hun. - Well, you'll sort it out however you like, but, I think a game of baseball sounds fun and I wish you would. For me? You hear what I'm saying? You still there? Hello? - And he was serious? - Yeah, we couldn't come to any sort of agreement so he threw out this idea to play an actual game. - Damn straight he did. - I figured why not? I mean, I want this stupid bat and we couldn't agree on anything else. - Oh shit, I'm calling the boys so hard. - Do you even play baseball? - I played little league, and high school for like a year. - Oh, this is gonna be rich. - Oh come on! - [Teague] Big D, we got ourselves a baseball game! - I can play sporting events, you don't know. Sport your event. - It's not how you do it. - I dunno. - This is gonna be great. I haven't played a game of organized baseball in a long time. I really appreciate you inviting me. You should stop by, I'm right next door. Hey, I never see ya man. - Hey. - Hey, thanks for meeting me. - Yeah, sure man. So you really wanna do this? You wanna play a game? - Yeah, I guess so. - Hey, I'm Clark. - Nice to meet you. - Teague. Terribly looking forward to beating you, terribly. - All right, relax there, killer. - So how are we gonna work this? We still have to go get the bat. - Right, I guess I could pick it up tomorrow during my lunch break. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, and we're just supposed to trust you? How do we know you're just gonna run off with it? - And you're so trustworthy? - Okay. - Why don't we just hire a third-party to hang onto it? They don't need to know it's worth anything. - Yeah, yeah, and they can be the umpire too. We kill two birds with one stone. - Oh an umpire? Getting fancy huh? - Do we need batting helmets or anything? Great. - I'm sure we're fine. It's not like we're throwing fast balls right? - What's the least amount of players we can get away with? - Maybe six each with a designated pitcher. - What? No, no, no, no. We have to pitch, it's part of the game and I can totally get us nine for our team. - See, I don't think I can. - How about seven players each, no short stop, only two in the out field and then we can have some real pitching. - Does that work for you? Okay, I'll post an ad online for an umpire and I'll give you a buzz tomorrow I guess. See ya on the field. - Yeah, sure buddy. No worries. Okay, okay, you too. All right, thanks Bob. Well, guess I didn't realize how few folks I actually know. - What about Clark, does he have friends who'll play? - Well, his cousin Brian but that's it. - What about people from work? (groans) - Maybe this is a dumb mistake. - Oh come on, it's gonna be fun. Just you wait. When you get there on the ball field, it's gonna be a blast. I'm so happy you're doing this. You've no idea. - I just didn't think this through. I have a feeling he's gonna show up with all these young, tough guys. - Sure, it'll be fine. - Oh, you're not dreaming. - Hashtag where's the beer. - Somebody order a baseball team? - Oh, we're real. - Well, all right, come on in guys, how are you doing? - Nice to meet ya, I'm Dustin, you can call me D, Hollywood, Dapper, doesn't matter, I'm not picky. - I'm Scott, where's Teague's hot sister and what is she doing with you? - Um, she's in the living room. - My boys! ...and guess who's looking right back at me when I turn around? - Who? - My mom, so she starts screaming at me and how was I supposed to know there were girl scouts outside, I just opened the door. - Did you get any thin mints? - Oh man, I knew I made a mistake. - I got a question for you. Do you think that your and Grant's kids are gonna get along with our kids? - Idiot. - Where's Jesse at? - Oh, he'll be there for the game. He had to take care of the wife tonight. - And that's why I'm not getting married. Grant knows what I'm talking about. - Oh, is that the game? - Dude, no, there's no game. Told you, it's timing. - Mm, I'll bet. - I'm actually impressed you managed to stall her off this long, considering her serpent's tongue. When we were kids, she could talk us into doing anything. - Yeah and she did. Remember that time we found that dog biscuit in the grass? She got Scott to eat it in like 30 seconds. - Yeah! - What can I say? It's skill. - I'd do it all again, for you, I'll do it again. - Anyway, I'm stoked about playing man, it's gonna be fun. Any chance to reanimate the doom room. - Doom! - To the glory days! - Some of us are still in 'em. (bottles clink) - Maybe we think we are. (cars roaring) - Where is this guy? I don't have much time to wait. - Your guess is as good as mine. I spoke to him less than an hour ago. - You sure he's? - He seems on the up and up. I mean, he told me he used to umpire for the minors. - Why'd he stop? - No idea. - Great. - Oh, that's gotta be him. Hey Joe? Hey Joe? Joe? - Great. - Hey you should've told me parking was so terrible in this neighborhood. I had to park three blocks up. - I'm sorry about that. I should've warned you. Thanks for coming though, I appreciate you meeting us. Here's the trophy. - Oh okay. - Take really good care of it okay? - Yeah. - Yeah, it's really sentimental. - Wait a minute, you guys don't have me holding something illegal-like do you? - [Both] Oh no. - No, no, it's just a plain old plain old baseball bat. - So it's like some sort of a-- - It's just this inside joke that we do. - So when's the ball game? - Tomorrow. - Okay. I'm looking forward to being there. - Okay, thanks so much, we really appreciate it. - Um. About the money? - Oh, right, right, right. You have what I asked you to bring? - Yeah. - Half up front and then half after the game, right? - Yeah, that's fair. - All right, thanks a lot, Joe, we really, really appreciate it. - Okay, looking forward to it. - [Grant] Okay. - Okay. - Thanks. - [Joe] See ya. - There goes that, guess it's official. Now how do we know he's not just gonna take off on us? - We don't. Let's just hope he needs the rest of that money. You know, I could've hung onto the bat. - I could've hung onto the bat. I don't like any of this. - We'll be all right. How's your team coming? - I'll be all right, it's coming. - [Mr. Webb] Hey, what's this baseball game I'm hearing about? - Oh, it's nothing, sir. - Both the Daves told me about a game they're playing tomorrow morning? (phone ringing) Sounds like fun, you've got room for another? - Unfortunately, I don't think-- - You know, I've spent my fair share of time on a baseball diamond. Actually, I was a pretty great pitcher. Hey, I can even teach you a few things. Classic curve ball. You've got your four seam slider. You've got your fast ball. I mean you should've seen this-- - Would you like to join us, sir? - Really? You'd like to have me? - Absolutely, sir. We'd love to have you. - Great! Gotta call my wife, see if she can find where my glove is. It'll be like Team Webb and Company. You know what I like about you, Roy? You're full of great ideas. (phone ringing) (sighs) (chair squeaks) - Jeffrey Webb is playing baseball? Holy crap, I gotta see this. - Yeah. - Well, at least you have a team! - Yeah. - Who knows, he might be really great! Maybe he'll surprise you. (coffee pot slams) - Talked to dad today about everything. The bat and this game. - It's nice of you to visit him everyday. You don't have to. - I like to, he deserves it. - And I deserve a nice relaxing evening so I'm gonna go upstairs and take a bubble bath. It'll be nice if when I got out, my husband was waiting for me. So finish up, meet me upstairs and get that dusty box off my table. (lighthearted music) (gentle music) (smacks) (lighthearted music) (bass thumping music) - See ya in the morning, sugar plum. - Yeah, thanks again for playing with me. I can't thank you guys enough. - No problemo man. We're gonna kick some ass. It was good hanging with you, all right? - Yeah, absolutely. - See ya tomorrow. - [Scott] Tell Rachael I love her and I'm gonna call her tonight and I'm gonna take her to the movies! (brushing) - Hey hun. - Hey can you do me a favor? Think you can ask your brother to stop showing me photos of all of his sexual escapades? - Mm. - Yeah. (water gushing) - Are you ready for your widdle baseball game? - Thanks. Yeah, the guys are all excited. - Well, are you excited? - Well yeah, there's money on the line so. - Doesn't matter, just have fun. God knows you deserve it, Mr. Serious Pants. Fun! Fun? - Fun. Fun. Fun. (lighthearted music) - Well. - Well, all right. - All right boys. Babe's rules, seven innings, four for a walk, three strikes you're out, no blocking home plate. You must tag up and no stealing. - Hi, are you here for the-- - Hi! The game. - The game, yeah. Hi, Jane. - Hi, Rachael. - Roy's wife. - Good to meet you. - He's the one with the-- - Oh great. - Yeah. So are you um. - Grant's fiance. - Grant's fiance, oh okay, great, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - It's a pleasure. - Who's at bat first? Who's home, away? Who's at bat first? - I am, do you wanna rock, paper, scissors for it? - Let's just flip a coin. - Okay. - Hey, why didn't we do that-- - Here, here. Why don't you use this? - [Dustin] Did he just bust out a Susan B. Anthony? - White people. (scoffs) - Your call. - Heads. That's us. - Well all right, let's play ball. - That's what I say. - Oh I was just-- - I say play ball. - Oh. - Well, okay if you-- - [Grant] Okay. - So do you think they're gonna be any good? - I think we'll be a good team. - Wow, okay. - Yeah. - Play ball! (rock and roll music) (bats cracking) (cheering) (music intensifies) (bat knocks) (cheering) - Leg it out, Grant, leg it out, Grant. Come on, leg it out, leg it out, leg it out. - Out at first! - [Rachael] All right guys, good job, good job. (clapping) - [Jane] Good job. - Oh! (clapping) (bat crack and cheering) - [Dustin] Champs! All right Teague, you're the league. - [Scott] Go T-train! - [Jesse] You got it man, put it out there. - [Scott] Go brah! - [Jesse] Come on now, Teague. (cheering) - I got it, I got it. - You got it? - I got it? - You got it? I got it! (cheering) - [Rachael] All right guys, good job, good job. (clapping) - [Jane] You got this. - What do we bring? - [Team] Doom! - To whom?! - [Team] The whole damn room! (clapping) (birds chirping) - Come on, Roy! (clapping) - [Grant] Come on Big D. Come on Dustin! - [Rachael] Come on Big D! You got this! - Strike one! - [Teague] That's all right! - Okay, I see you. (clapping) - [Clark] Let's go Roy, come on. Strike this guy out. - [Teague] Oh! Cash homie, that's it D-Money. - Oh, my poor husband. I just wish he would just enjoy himself. - He is sort of getting beaten badly. Sorry. (chattering) - Strike three! That's three out! - Good try, babe! - How many did you guys score? - Nine. - Oh man. (clapping) - Hey, it's no big deal. God gave you a pretty woman, you can't expect to be good at sports too. - Come on, I'm not that bad. - Let's take the field gentlemen. I'll cover second and short. Jesse, you take the out field, use your legs. - Man, this is a slaughter. I almost feel bad. - Almost. - Okay batter, step in. - Who's that? (laughs) - That's my husband's boss. (playful music) - Strike one! Strike two! Strike three! (team groans) - [Dustin] Do like you do, Teague! - Okay, come on Roy! (clapping) Let's go, babe! - [Clark] Come on Roy, you're the man. - [Dave A.] Let's go Roy! Oh yeah. - [Webb] Come on Roy! (cheering) - Yes! - Atta boy! - We should all do that! (clapping) - Throw it in, throw it in. - [Dustin] Bring it in Jesse. Come on, Brandon bring it in. - [Dave] Other Dave, other Dave, other Dave! - [Clark] You got this man. (playful music) - Strike! - [Jane] Don't let it get to ya! It's all right! - [Clark] Come on Dave. - Two! Strike three, you're out! - [Jane] All right guys, good job, good job. - You got this. (clapping) - Come on, Clark! Give us something here! - [Jane] All right, Clark's show now. Come on, Clark! - [Dustin] Okay guys, back it up, back it up guys. (suspenseful music) (cheering) - Guys, guys, guys! Sorry, but you're gonna have to give up the field, we've got little league here in like 10 minutes. - Wait, what's going on? - Little league, game's over. - Well that sucks. - Well, we at least got an inning in the bag and I think we can all agree it was a total a domination. - Hold on a second man, just relax. - Well, I hate to admit it but he's kind of got a point. It was a slaughter, and we did got a full inning in. It's not like the score was close and we're like mid-inning or-- - No, that's bullshit. The agreement was a game, not an inning, a game and we're gonna finish it. I mean we barely got started. - Sorry guys, you're gonna have to clear the field like now. - Is there practice next week? - Yeah, it's early though, it should be done by noon. - All right, can everybody make it back next week? - Yeah. - I can do that. - I can be there. - That's fine with me. - They dig their own grave. - Well, I guess we'll see each other next weekend then. - I guess so. - Okay! - It was so good meeting you. So great to meet someone new. - I know! Now you have my number. - I have your number. - Yes, let's go to yoga. - Yeah, yoga, or lunch or whatever else. - I'm really sorry, Roy. - Yeah, me too, Roy. - Oh, don't worry about it, Dave, Dave. It's just a game. We'll try again next week? - Totally, I'll be better I promise. - Me too. - Hey, you wanna practice together? - Yes! - Cool! The dog park right by my place. If we go there with like, a ball. - Roy, my boy. (chuckles) Thanks again for having me... I'm afraid... I might've activated a little college injury I had, you know? Back is kicking in on me too. Look, so, eh. I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it next week. My wife has got some things, commitments I gotta help her with and everything. So I'm sorry, but I'll see you back in the office on Monday. - Anybody ever tell you, you look like Gilligan? - See you next week, Barney Rubble. - Well, that was fun. - Was it? - Well, yeah I certainly enjoyed seeing you out there on the field. I'm sorry it got cut short. But it was kind of really nice seeing you looking all athletic. (lighthearted music) (machine swooshes) (smacking) - Hey, all things considered, I had a pretty good time out there. Going to the gym's one thing but being out there with you guys on the field, that felt like being a man, like being with my dad and my brothers, you know what I mean? - Yeah, I understand. - That's what I'm talking about, you're getting the hang of it. - Maybe. - Oh, well. (coins clinking) (pitching machine fires) (bat cracking) - Holy crap. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Jane] Hey handsome, you visiting dad? - No, actually I'm at the batting cages. - Really? Wow! That's great! All right, well I won't keep you, I just wanted to quickly call you before my next class to tell you to come home straight after work. - Okay, why? - Well, I invited Grant and his fiance Rachael over for dinner. - What? (groans) - I've been chatting with Rachael and I just think she's great and I just think it would be really nice to have them over. I mean, you're playing a friendly game, it's not like they're the enemy. - But they're the enemy! - They're not the enemy. We're just playing a game of baseball against them. - Yeah, against them, by definition, the enemy, and what's this crap, getting all fancy? - It's called being an adult. I know. A concept that you are oh so unfamiliar with but sometimes when adults meet new people, they like to look nice. Put your best foot where baby? Forward. - Forward. - Do you know where my black jacket is? - Uh, hallway closet? Listen man, I'm not necessarily thrilled either but she's excited and so I'm obliging. - [Rachael] And that's called compromise. Can you say compromise? - I don't like it. I don't like it one bit. I'm calling the boys and telling them you're a sell out. - You ready? - Yeah. (lighthearted music) (laughs) - [Jane] Well, what else was I supposed to do? There was nowhere to change. (laughs) - [Rachael] Oh my god. - Oh, I have to be honest, it's so nice to have another couple over. It's just been a while since we've socialized. - Well, we're so glad you invited us. Your home is perfect. I can't wait til we have a house of our own, we can get out of our rental. - Let's worry about having a wedding first, then we'll worry about buying a house. - Oh, can we worry about having a wedding? - You know what I mean. - Oh, a hold out, eh? - I wouldn't say I'm a hold out, I just, I want things to be right. - Well, if you wait for things to be just right, you will be waiting forever. More wine? - Yeah, I could have another, thanks. - So, how long have you two been married? - Oh, about 16 years now. - Okay, so you must've be married then when you were about our age. - [Jane] I came here to college and Roy was the local that all the girls loved. Just super funny and outgoing, and charming. - Yeah? - Oh yeah, I had to beat the Barbies off with a stick, then after a while of like will they, won't they, we did, and we've been together ever since. - That's awesome. - Hey, why don't you take Grant down to the bar because we wanna chat about you guys behind your backs. - [Rachael] Mm hmm. (lighthearted music) - Yeah sure. - Play nice. When we first started dating, he looked like a young Tom Selleck. - Who is Tom Selleck? (lighthearted music) - Scotch, rum, vodka, what's your drink? - Um, Jack and coke? Wow, you got quite a collection here man. - Yeah. - Are all of these signatures real on these 68's? - Yup. - Wow. (ice shaking) Your father? - Yup. - So you want the bat for him? - Excuse me? - That day we bought it, you said you wanted to bring it to him. - Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, as a kid, all I ever heard about was Norman Cash. - Who is that? - The player whose signature is on the bat. - Oh, right, right, right, yeah, obviously. Thanks. - My dad's favorite player. He'd finished up with work, come home and all he wanted to do is watch Norman Cash. Stormin' Norman. The big time hitter. The Louisville slugger loaded with pine tar. He was quite a character, all sorts of antics. I'd always hear this one story. You know who Nolan Ryan is, right? - Yeah. - 1973, he's in a record setting year. He's about to pitch his second career no hitter. Well, it's the bottom of the ninth, there's one batter left and it's Norman Cash. Well, Norman steps up to the plate with a wooden table leg instead of an actual bat. (laughs) - He had an actual table leg in the middle of a Major League game? - Yeah. Apparently he'd gotten the leg off a table in the clubhouse. (laughs) Brought it out with him and he's up at the plate with a wooden table leg. Well, nobody really knew exactly what was going on but apparently the umpire was pissed. - I can imagine. - Then he scolded Norm saying, "you can't swing that table leg" and Norm says, "why not? I'm not gonna hit him anyway." (laughs) - That's fantastic. (laughs) - Dad's favorite thing. Baseball in general. - So he's nearby then, your dad? - He's just up the road. - Oh. Well, I tell you what, when I win the game, and I buy out your half of the bet, I'll sell it back to you for a really great deal and then you can bring it to him. - Yeah, I saw on your card that this is your business. Buying and selling collectibles? - Yeah, it was supposed to be a business when I started it, yeah, that was the idea. - It doesn't sound like business is going that well. - No, actually it's going the exact opposite of well, it's going quite terrible but par for the course, I suppose. I tell you what, if you ever decide to get rid of any of this stuff, you let me know 'cause I can definitely make us both a pretty penny at the next trade show. - So you're not even really into baseball then? - Oh, I like baseball. At one point I loved baseball. It was super important to me and my mother when I was young. - Oh yeah, your mom not your dad? - Oh no, my father wasn't around. - Oh I'm sorry. - It's nothing. My mom was the greatest little league mother in the history of little league mothers. I assure you and for all the wrong reasons. I remember one time when she thought an umpire made a bad call and I don't even think the call was on me, if I remember correctly, I think it was just one of my teammates. She storms the plate and is screaming at this guy, inches from his face, like kicking sand, just the vulgarities, I mean, the whole nine. He ejects her from the game. She literally is kicked off of the field, she has to watch the rest of the game from her car, like parked on the street, way beyond the right field fence. Yeah, I'm pretty sure she was the very first parent, let alone mother to ever be ejected from a game in the history of the entire league. Yeah, she was a character in her own right. (laughs) Yeah, at one point, baseball was definitely was super important. I think most men in America though, you know? At some point in their childhood, everything revolved around playing baseball, right? May I? - Yeah. - I will say this, I had a lot more fun than I thought I would on Saturday. I thought it was actually a really good time playing again. - Yeah, maybe for you. (laughs) - Four years? - Yep. - Jeez, that is a long engagement. - Oh, you don't have to tell me. - [Jane] Why? - He just, he has these unrealistic expectations for himself and it has nothing to do with me which is the worst part. - How so? - Well, for one thing, he constantly tells me that he thinks he's failing as a man. - What is it with the Y chromosome? - I don't know! I mean, I tell him all the time that I'm here to support him and that I love him no matter what but he is so stubborn. He feels if he can't provide, or prove himself as a better man than his deadbeat father, that he's not worthy of marriage, or something stupid like that. Like success has to come before happiness. - Trust me when I tell you I completely understand. Roy is very similar in ways. He's always looking for happiness in the wrong places, and I too feel like I tell him all day long how much I love him, only for it to pass right through. The biggest thing holding these men back is their irritating desire to be men. - So true. (glasses clink) The question is, what's it gonna take? I mean, what do they need to snap themselves out of it? - I was wondering where you found that guy. - Yeah, well, when the guy who signs your checks wants to play, you let him. You should've seen him, in the office, moaning and limping. Feels like he ran a marathon. - Well, you can't play with just six players, man. We're scraping by enough with seven. - Yeah, I know. - Hate to say it but your team is bad enough as it is. Down a man, you definitely don't stand a chance. - Yeah, I know. - Well look at it this way, your team really sucked, and now, you have an opportunity to get a different player, somebody better. - Right, someone better. (lighthearted music) (bat cracking) Hey would you be interested in playing a pick-up style game of baseball tomorrow? (gentle music) (lighthearted music) - Well, if we wait around any longer, it'll be dark out. - He'll be here, any second now. - Usually when someone says they'll be here at any second, that's the exact moment where-- - Well, hey, there he is. (upbeat rock and roll music) - What the hell? (upbeat rock and roll music) - How is that fair? He's wearing cleats! - Dude, he is a cleat. I guess you took my advice. - Sorry I'm late. - Don't mention it. Everybody, this is, Heinrich, was it? He's on our team. - Dude's name is Heinrich, he said Heinrich. - Just call me Hank. (thunder & lightning crack) - Hi Hank. - Hi. - You're a big dude. - Well, I drink a lot of milk. - Okay. Joe, do you wanna do the honors? - Play ball! - Hard fall from the beanstalk this morning? (bat cracking) (cheering) - [Clark] Nice Hank, yeah! (clapping) (upbeat music) (cheering) - Go, go, go, go, go! (upbeat music) - Let's go. - [Jane] All right, come on babe. - Come on Hank! (cheering) (upbeat music) (clapping) (cheering) (upbeat music) - [Jane] That's how we do it, nice job Hank! (cheering) (upbeat music) - Two out! - Oh! - You're out of there! (groans) (cheering) (upbeat music) - [Clark] Come on dude. (cheering) - [Dugout] Oh! - [Clark] Hustle, hustle. - [Rube] Woo! (bat cracks) (cheering) - [Rachael] Yea Jesse, Nice catch! (groans) - Strike one. - Did you guys know that baseball is the oldest game? Like we're playing the oldest game right now. - [All] No. - Absolutely not, no. - Not a fact. - [Scott] Pretty sure it is. - No, I can think of 100 games older than this. - Strike two! - You know, old mustache ain't too bad of a pitcher. (clapping) - How do you classify that thing? - I'd say it's a Burt Reynolds. Or what's that singer from Queen? - Freddie Mercury? - Yes. - Nah, it's more of a Teddy Roosevelt. - Maybe a Sam Elliot starter kit. - It's clearly a Steve Harvey. - [Team] Oh! - It's always Steve Harvey with this guy. - He's America's sweetheart. - And the survey says! (bat cracks) Whoa. Foul ball! - You're out of there! - Yeah, come on! That's it, keep it up, guys! - Okay, well now it's serious. I don't think we can be friends. (clapping) - Let's go Roy, you got this man. He's got nothing on you, show 'em. - Strike one! - [Jane] That's okay Roy, shake it off, it's cool. - There you go, Teague. Throw him a basketball, maybe then he'll actually hit it. - Yeah, I'll show you a basketball. (cheering) - Oh, all right, okay. - [Jane] Go, go, go, go, go! - [Rachael] Oh, nicely done! (cheering) - You got this man, hustle. - [Clark] We're selling out boy, good job. One legged man! - Woo! Let's go Roy! Nice job! - What the hell, you're supposed to be rooting for me! Can you believe this one? - Yeah she's a funny one. You know, you're a lucky guy. - I am. - Why don't you stop being an idiot and marry her already? - What? - Come on, man up, stop dicking around. She deserves it. (cheering) - [Jane] Woo! Yeah, nice job honey! - [Rachael] Nice job! (upbeat rock and roll music) - [Teague] All day baby. - Give you credit man, not easy to start playing baseball when you're middle aged. - [Joe] Strike! - Think that your talking is distracting me. - You look familiar. I must've bought a used car off you last week. - I work in insurance! (cheering) - That wasn't as stupid in my head. (clapping) - Strike. Wait, wait. (music stops abruptly) There was that one, he swung at that. Ball, ball, foul went that way, strike three. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. (upbeat rock and roll music) (cheering) - What's wrong? - Nothing. I just want to say thanks for including me. - Yeah, of course. - There's the ball. - Doing a good job. (bat cracks and cheering) - I could've made it home but I just wanted to say hello. - Hi. Shoes untied. - Muscles and jokes? Think I'm in love. - Nice hit man. High five! Come on, don't leave me hanging. Come on. I will tickle the shit out of you, come on, lighten up. - Stop, knock it off! - Lighten up! You owe me five, little man. ♪ Of me ♪ (clapping) (cheering) (upbeat music) (cheering) - [Joe] Three outs, that's the inning. - [Jane] No, that is silly. - [Rachael] You have to. - But why does it have to be those three? - [Rachael] Because that's who I picked. It's the game. - Okay, okay. I guess marry Bill Gates, kill the Pope and the other thing with the President. - Really? You're gonna to kill the poor old Pope just to get your kicks in the White House? - Well it's a really nice house. (laughs) (laughs) (cheering) - [Dave A] Way to go, Hank! - [Dustin] All right, good play, come on. - How's it going? - [Clark] Come on Roy. - [Dustin] Plays at any base guys. Plays at any base. - You know, I, I kind of feel like I'm the you of my team. You know? - [Clark] Come on Roy, you're the man. - [Dave D] Let's go Roy! - [Joe] Foul Ball! - So where'd they find you anyways? - Just at the cages. - Oh, I see, a true ringer. - All right, level with me, how much are they paying you? Be honest. - Excuse me? - I figured, considering what's on the line, he might be greasing you a little. Throw ya a little something for your troubles. - What's on the line? - Yeah, Roy and Grant threw this whole game together to see who wins this valuable bat or something. I mean he hired the umpire to hang onto the bat so I figured he just hired you too. - Really? - No, I didn't know anything about that but thanks for the info. Gotta go. (cheering) - Well I find your job fascinating. - It's okay. - It's so exciting. Plus I'm obsessed with those daytime court shows. Oh my god, I love Joe Brown. - Well, let me tell you, a real courtroom is just like that. - Really? - No, you dummy, of course not. - Don't do that to me. I'm gullible. - [Roy] Come on buddy. - [Brian] Let's go Bump! - [Roy] Move the runners Bump, move the runners. (cheering) - [Joe] Three outs, that's the inning. - What's the score, ump? - All tied up, 16, uhhh 16? - Yeah, you got it. - Hey, last inning, what do you say to a little 7th inning stretch? My guys could use five or 10. - Uh, yeah yeah, it's fine with me. All right guys, 7th inning stretch. Final inning starts in 10. - Looks like they're taking a break. - Think we've got time for an iced coffee? - Yeah, I think we have time for a bloody Mary. - I think we always have time for a bloody Mary. - Let's go. (door clicks) - I wouldn't go in there just yet. Look, we've got one inning to go and Drago out there can't hold them for much longer so that bat is as good as ours. - Jeez, I forgot we're actually playing for a reason. - Yeah, look at you, you're all loosey goosey. It's like you finally pulled the stick out of your butt and tried to hit a baseball with it. (laughs) - Thank you? - [Joe] Sonofa bitch! What the hell was that? - I don't know. (suspenseful music) - [Grant] Joe, what's wrong? Is everything okay? - I came up to get my smokes and they-- - Somebody broke into your car? - Yeah and they took that... the bat. - Wait, the bat is gone? - I'm sorry, I know it was sentimental to you guys. - No, it's not your fault, I mean you don't have any-- - What's going on? - The bat's gone. - What do you mean the bat's gone? - He means somebody jacked the fucking bat. - Damn it, how the fuck? - I'll tell you how the fuck. Notice who's missing here. (suspenseful music) - Where's the big guy? - That's right, your fucking ringer. Big shot stole the bat. - God dammit. - I knew this was bullshit. - Wait, how would Hank even know about it? Oh, this guy can't keep his mouth shut. - Guys, he's right here. - What's going on? - Where the fuck is the bat? - What are you talking about? What, you call a friend or something to come grab it? Or maybe you're working with this piece of shit, he's just playing pretend. - [Grant] Dude, relax! - You relax! The bat's fucking gone and he took it. - I'm telling you I didn't do shit. - I swear, if I find out that you took my dad's bat-- - What, you'll do what? - Dude, Roy, enough man, come on. I'm sorry, I have no idea what the hell's going on here. - Yeah, I don't need this shit. - Roy. - The bat is gone. - Well, I guess that's a game, we're gonna call it a night. - Good game guys. It was fun playing with you. - I never seen him like this. I didn't realize it meant that much to him. - Yeah. (birds chirping) (dog barking) Roy! Roy, dude are you all right? Hey man, I'm sorry about the bat, but I lost money too you know. - Who gives a shit about the money? - I give a shit about the money. - Well I don't. I wanted it for him, all right? I wanted it for him. - Your dad? I'm sure he'll understand it was stolen. - We need to finish the game. That's what my dad would do, he'd at least finish the game. - How the hell do we expect to finish the game? Everybody's gone. - Just take the bat. - What am I gonna do with this? - [Roy] It'll be me against you. - What are you talking about? Roy! - 10 pitches each. Most hits wins. - That's ridiculous. What are we trying to prove? What the hell is wrong with you? - That's one. Nine more to go. - I'm not doing this, this is absolutely pointless. - Raise the bat to your shoulder and swing the fucking thing. - Dude, you throw one more fucking pitch at me, I swear. - That's two, eight left! - Fine, goddammit, you want to finish it? Let's go. (groans) Roy! (somber music) (chattering) Hey. - Hey, hun. He's gonna be fine. - Oh, thank god. - It's a minor orbital bone fracture. It'll... couple of weeks. - I am so sorry, I really-- - Oh no. You don't need to be sorry. He was the one being an asshole. I'm sorry. Hell, I should thank you. Here, sit. This week, he went to the batting cages on his lunch break. The batting cages. You don't know what a big that is for him. I mean, he invited our neighbor over to watch a game and talk strategy. He was social, active, like alive, and even today during the game, I saw a smile on him that I haven't seen in ages, you know? It was a smile of a proud man, a man fulfilled, and even if it was just for a few fleeting moments today, he was just living life. Just enjoying it. I miss that man. - So then, what was that all about tonight? What was that-- - Roy's father left a very large void in his life. One that he refuses to live peacefully with. Instead he obsesses over it, tries again and again to fill it with anything. As if a bat, or an autograph baseball, or a trading card, or some dumb object will make it all go back the way it was. I suppose to him, the bat is just another representation of his father and it getting taken away, I dunno, probably just reminded him of having his father taken away all over again.

It's too hot for coffee. I should've got a frappucino. - You always do that. - Yeah. I'll frap your chino. You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine, why? - You're just, unusually quiet today. You didn't say anything when we walked past the store. - What store? - You know exactly what store. The bridal shop. Every time we've ever walked past there you always I don't know, say something to me, make a comment. - Do I? Oh, I'm sorry, I don't wanna be a nag. - It's not a nag, just, nothing to say today? Giving up on me? - I'm not giving up. I'm just, there's just no point anymore. I've realized that you need to do what it is that you think you need to do and it's completely out of my control. If I haven't gotten through to you yet, it's probably not gonna happen anytime soon. What is it people always say? The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results? I don't want to be an insane person. Oh no, I'm pretty sure that's not the definition of insanity. - So you don't care anymore? You don't care about the big wedding? You don't care about getting married? - No, of course I do. It's all I ever wanted. To marry my fiance. Unfortunately my fiance is a mule. - God, that's. That's so sad. - It's fine. No, it's not fine, I mean. I broke you. - You didn't break me. It's fine, everything's fine. I love you, we're great. Did I ever tell you what Roy told me that day we were on the field? He told me that I should "stop dicking around" and marry you already. He said that you deserved it. - I think Roy is a very smart man. Have you spoken to him lately? - No. - I think you should call him. I'm gonna run to the ladies' room. I'm done with that if you wanna throw it away. (lighthearted music) - Excuse me, have you got a pen I can borrow? - Yeah. (gentle music) - Grant. What are you doing? - I'm asking you to marry me. - You already did that, remember? - I know, I'm doing it again. Roy is absolutely right, you do deserve it. You deserve everything that you want out of me, life in general. You're hands down the greatest thing that's ever happened to me and I've been too dense to see it, despite you telling me time and time again. I am so sorry. I'm sorry that you've been the one who's had to sacrifice and that it's been you who suffered day in, day out through all of my idiotic issues. Would you take it already? It's just a napkin. - Would you get up? (lighthearted music) - I'm sorry. (birds chirping) (doorbell rings) (door clicks) Hey man. - Hello. - I'm sorry having to drop by unannounced, I've tried calling ya a couple of times but you haven't gotten back to me. - Yeah, sorry. - How's your eye? - It's fine, another week of the patch and I'll, it's fine. - Good, good I'm glad to hear. I got something for you. From Hank actually. - So he did take it? - No, not at all. - Uh, we probably should've done some research, you and I. It turns out some motor company in the 1970's gave these out as a promotional item. The signature's not real, it's just an imprint. There are literally thousands of them. Two of which, Hank had. I caught up with him and he felt bad about everything so he wanted you to have it. (laughs) - How did we even-- - I don't know, dude. (laughs) But hey, that's not it, we're actually gonna go play some ball. - Hey Nick Fury, we found Thor. - Sit down, little man. - Yes, sir. We're gonna try and make a regular thing of it like every other week or so. Just for fun. We're hoping that maybe when your eye's all healed up, you'll come back and join us? Maybe tell Clark and Brian, we could switch the teams up every week so that it's-- - You know what, I dunno, I appreciate it but well, thanks for this. - Sure man. And hey, I. I'm really sorry that you lost your father. I know that he meant a lot to you. I mean, I never even had a dad to begin with. I just hope that somehow you can find some peace it that and I hope to see you on the field again. (somber music) - I don't want to ride with Hank, he makes fun of me. (dog barking) - Was that Grant I heard out front? They're playing another game? You don't wanna play? - This is the bat we wanted. Signature isn't real. It was totally worthless. - So? This stuff is all worthless really if you think about it. - It makes me feel like he's still here. - Does it? Dad always made you smile. You've never come home with a smile on your face after buying any of this stuff. Hell, I think you smiled more during the baseball game than you have in two years. What happens when there's nothing left to collect? - He'll still be gone. (somber music) - It's time to let this go.
