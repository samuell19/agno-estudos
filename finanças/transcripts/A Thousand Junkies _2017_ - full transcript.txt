[TJ] Well, he can lie about where he is. [Tommy] Yeah. And he can lie about how long he's gonna be. [TJ] Well, he's coming man. [Blake] You know, we've been here for an hour now. [TJ] It hasn't been an hour. [Tommy] Pretty close to an hour. [TJ] It has not been an hour. [Tommy] It's definitely been 45 minutes, man, without a doubt. [TJ] Without a fucking doubt. You guys wanna know how long we've been here? We've been here 37 minutes... and I called him four minutes ago. See, man, this is exactly why we need to-- We need to make a move and get our hands on legitimate funds. I mean, we do, you know. We gotta make a fuckin' play, and actually, like, sit down and fuckin' organize and plan this shit. Why don't you let me get a little something in my system before you start with your criminal delusions, okay? They're not delusions, Tommy. They're facts. You're a fucking strange motherfucker, man. [scoffs] [sighs] Dude, your chick is flipping out right now, man. She's flipping the fuck out, man. Why don't you call her? I know. -Text her at least. -I know. Man, she's gonna have the National Guard searching for your ass. It is the fucking coke, man. No, it is, man. Turns 'em to fucking monsters. All right, come on. Stop it. Nobody forced you to shoot it. It's sitting there in front of me. What am I gonna do? Not shoot it? All right, fuck this, man. I'm gettin' some coffee. Don't get a coffee, man. No, we need the money for gas. And besides, that's not coffee. It's sad brown water. Coffee is coffee. Coffee is absolutely not coffee. -Then what is it? -If anything, coffee is not coffee. Then what is it? Just let him get a coffee. Jesus. Go. Do what you want, man. Oh, thanks, Dad. You're gonna hit right away and I'm gonna be poking around for hours. It's 'cause I'm so skinny. And you're so fat. -[scoffs] -[TJ] Just kidding. [Tommy] Nah. It's true. I hate the first shot in the morning. Sometimes I hit, man, it's like, boom! Fuck, another time, I'm just digging around for hours, man. I had this spot right here on my shoulder that seemed like it was good, but I couldn't get a pen when I found it to mark it. -Yeah. -So the next time I was in there, I just couldn't find it. It was just gone. Well, just don't shoot in your leg. Start looking for veins now. You'll find one. Where? I thought this would come back. This little thing-- Look at those hands!

[Blake] What does it mean, dude? [TJ] It's like, prone to sudden mood swings without explanation. Why? [Blake] Nothing. It's just this dude called me "capricious" the other day. Pissed me off. [TJ] Well, he was wrong. You're just angry. [Tommy] Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I forgot the fucking gear. Really? Oh, fuck! Jesus fucking Christ, dude. So what? We'll go back to Hollywood, man.

God damn it. I always fall for that. It's not funny. I'm not waiting, man. I'm heading at the Arko. No. I hate that fuckin' bathroom. Why? 'Cause of the finger? I'm the one who found it. I'm not positive that was a finger. That was absolutely a finger. It had a fuckin' wedding ring. Could use the bathroom at the Mexican restaurant by the pool hall in Normandie. -The 24th? -Yeah. The cops eat there. Popeyes on Figueroa in Washington ain't bad. It's got a little window, you can smoke crack in there. What about the 76 and Adams by SC? That place is great. They moved inside the mini-mart. -Bastards. -I know. Well, we do always have the Mobil station at La Brea in Washington. They moved that inside, too. Yeah, but those Indian guys are pretty cool if worst comes to worst. You know where's an amazing bathroom? Remember that coffee house on Beverly, when it was that other place, and had that big, purple, velvet armchair? It was like shooting up at a Turkish whorehouse. I know. I felt like a king. Yeah, but the best bathroom of all time-- -[phone ringing] -It's him. Hey, man. You close? What do you mean where are we? We're at the El Super on Slauson. Laundrymat? What laundrymat? Laundromat on Exposition? Jimmy, you never said anything about a laundrymat. No, I know it's not good to meet in the same spot every time. Tell him we're coming to the laundromat. Jimmy, I realize you're doing us a favor, and we appreciate it. Will you tell him we're coming to the fucking laundromat? We're coming to the fucking laundrymat. Why not? Well, where are you? Okay, we'll go there. How long? -[Blake groans] -No, he cannot do that. He cannot do that. Just tell him we're coming to the fucking laundromat. Will you shut the fuck up? Jimmy, where are you right now, right this second? Okay, then we'll come to Kaiser. How long does her ultrasound take? What? Jimmy, I can't hear you. Is she having an ultrasound or a baby? Oh, fuck! She's going into labor? The parking garage at Kaiser. Thank you, Jimmy. Okay, thank you. Parking garage at Kai-- Oh, shit! I didn't ask him what Kaiser. It's the one on Los Sienta. [engine starting] [upbeat music playing] [TJ] Hey, how did you know which Kaiser? [Tommy] That's the one he had the last kid at. [TJ] The twins? [Tommy] No, after the twins. The one who had to wear the thing on her head. [TJ] Oh, yeah. What was that thing? [Tommy] I don't know, it's some kind of straightening helmet. -[TJ] To straighten her head? -[Tommy] Yeah. [TJ] You know, I think Jimmy's a good father. [Blake] What? [TJ] I do, man. I think he's a good father. [Blake] He's a heroin dealer. [upbeat music playing] What if his wife does into, like, a 12-hour labor? So what? What do you think, he's gonna hold her hand the whole time like you would? He'll make her have the baby and carry her own bags to the car. Call him. If he's in the delivery room, he's probably got his phone turned off. -Yeah. -I know. [phone ringing] Oh, fuck! I'm sorry. I know I should have called you back. Mom. Of course I'm not dead, I've just been busy, all right? It's a good thing. Hey, let me ask you a personal question. Sure. All right. Really think about it, okay? Don't just answer. -You think you could rob a bank? -No. Come on, man! I told you to really think about it. I don't have to think about it. But you steal all the time. From my girlfriend. I don't burst through the front door of a bank with a shotgun, yelling, "This is a hold-up." Why was that a personal question? I could do it, man. I'm telling you, I could definitely rob a bank. That kind of shit just comes down to one thing, you know? Are you willing to kill someone? You don't have to do it, but you have to be willing. Yeah, well, I'm not willing. Killing someone is something everyone should do. I'm being serious. Everyone should know what it feels like to kill someone at least once before they die. Everyone. What about the person you're killing? Well, what if you kill them before they have the chance to know what it feels like to kill someone? I'm not back on drugs. I've been clean for months. No, don't do that. Mom, it's just gonna sit there. Can't you just send me the money instead? Fine. Fine. No, fine.

I wish my grandparents were still alive. I'm gonna call the Japanese guy. Hello? Hello? Hey. Hey, are you Japanese? Hello? [instrumental music playing] [Tommy] I was adding it up yesterday, and I have spent 950 days waiting for dealers. Almost 1,000 days of my life, waiting for dope. I cop anywhere from two to four times a day, so I'd say on the average, I spend three hours a day waiting, if you include the drive. Three hours a day is 21 hours a week. So let's round that off and say I spend one day a week waiting. 52 weeks in a year. So let's round that down to 50. I've been doing it every day since I'm 22, and I'm 42. That's 20 years. I'd lose a year for the odd rehab stint, failed 21-day methadone detox, so, let's say, 19 years. That's 50 days a year for 19 years. 950 days. Almost three years of my life waiting to get well. ♪ [music winds down] Cold. Where the fuck are we? [snorts] Adam's in Van Buren. [snorts] [spits] Fucking no money, man. No gas. That's where we are.

It's fucking pathetic. Besides, if I needed to get bailed out, you'd be the last person I'd call. Well, who would you call? Call them now. We're in trouble. I would call my mom. Yeah, she was real helpful with the watch. She bailed me out three different times last year. One of them was for an armed robbery beef. She put up the house to get me out. Oh, she must be so proud of you, you fucking criminal. Fuck you. No. A piece of candy. No. [laughs] You're not gonna share your candy bar? Listen, man, if you want a candy bar, go fucking steal it yourself, like I just did. Just give him a piece of chocolate. He's sick. [Blake sighs] There. -You want some, too? -No, I'm too sick.

You know, the guy who thinks he can beat LeBron James one-on-one. He doesn't think he can beat him one-on-one. He thinks he can score one point off him. Call Lonestar. Call LeBron James.
