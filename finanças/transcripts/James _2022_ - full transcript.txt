There are three markets in the world, Open market, deep market, dark market. Open market Everyone knows about it. Deep market If you try, you can know something about it. Dark market Most difficult market. It is very difficult to even get a small information about it. This market decides the economy and politics of a country. Power brokers, kingmakers and big businessmen are always active in this market. Weapon industry, human trafficking and drugs are its major sources of income. This is golden horse drug cartel, backbone for all the Asian countries, controlled by Joseph Anthony. Cheers, cheers! There are two syndicates in India. Northern territory is handled by Scorpion Syndicate, Ratan Lal controls it. This is Southern territory, controlled by Jaidev Gaikwad. Cheers ! Pratap Aras, a major power broker, is the backbone for this syndicate. This is Sangi Bar Island, major drug lab for South. Bali Aras, first son of Pratap Aras is taking care of this. The strange thing is, there are graves of many IAS and IPS officers here. All these information was gathered by NCB officer, Jagan. If one person as gathered all these information, he is really great sir ! I think this is enough to move forward sir. Get ready ! All our volunteers have been doing excellent work till date... Greetings sir ! I think you have been waiting since long ! Its all right, sir. People feel that politicians are ruling the country... But in real sense, corporate businessmen are ruling it. Greetings, Mr. Pratap Aras. I am against drugs since my college days. Its a devils thing ! Yes sir. We have been protesting against this since the time we started the party. But in vain. We are doubtful to complete the remaining four months. On top of that, you are asking for this permission. Yet, I have asked them to approve it from my side. Got it sir. You carry on... Thank you sir. Sir, Mr. Achar ... Its a world mafia, leave. Sure sir. The conversation sounded more like a warning, sir. I will retire in three months. You will complete two years of service in three months. Does that mean, we cannot do anything sir? Praveen, people who come without expectations have achieved much more than the ones who think they can achieve great heights. Who gave you the deal to kill my brothers? I dont know sir. I hate lies. I hate crimes. I am a bad criminal. Antony ... Joseph Antony. Please, dont kill us sir ! Please Dont shoot. Please dont shoot... Please ! Sir, We have been preserving these bodies for the last 10 months. It will be difficult for us to them for more days. If I cremate these bodies, my emotions will die too. Pain will subside. The pain should remain inside. Sir, informer has come. Preserve it. Yes sir. Vijay Gaikwad, son of your old friend Jaidev Gaikwad, gave the deal to kill your brothers. Situation is very critical... Dont send your brothers to India. You did not take our words seriously. We are facing huge losses. We are cancelling the deal. Emotion on son has become more than the affection on your friend, right ? Shall we kill him sir? No. He should not die at once... he should die each day. His heart should beat 140 times per minute instead of 72 times. Business collapsed in the international market because of this incidence. Even he should face it Dont beat him, beat his father. Your drinks, sir. Who beat my father? It does not seem like localites are involved. This is not simple killing, its a warning. Yours and your family security is very important at this time. Instead of hundreds of waste bodies holding guns, Find one man who himself is a Gun ! He should be ready to offer his chest as a shield to protect, And should also be able to shoot the opponents chest ! Sir, our bosss daughter went to Bengaluru this morning to attend a wedding, Reached Bengaluru at 12 o clock, Attended the wedding at 1 o clock, Their phone is not reachable since 2 o clock.

You came to Ashram to propose her? Listen... Even if you propose, they should not get to know that it is a proposal. That is how you should propose. How is that sir? You need special talent for that. Follow me. Thank you. Hello madam. Just a couple of minutes. Just two minutes. Please. What? You play it well. Thank you. You come here daily? Sometimes. How much do you earn? Social service..

He will surely get locked. You are Santosh, right? New security manager. You? Are you Vinutha, daughter of Shankar Gowda? No. Face reading? Mobile reading... Nisha. Nisha Gaikwad. That is you madam? You were not reachable. I never expected to reach you like this. Shall we leave? Two minutes. Santosh, one small story. There is a garden full of flowers... There is a board in front of that... Enjoy looking at the flowers... But please dont pluck them. Why is that? Why? You should have a certain range to even touch it. So, it is important to know someones range before liking them. Oh, range ! Madam, one small story from my side too. One village, one rich man... He was aged and died.. He was cremated... Same village, one old man... He was aged and died, He was cremated too... I am searching for the range between these two... Not able to find it.. Did you get it? According to me range does not mean travelling in Range Rover... Real range means your character should not change when situation changes. We are the ones who feel happy by seeing the moon... We dont dream to keep it in our pocket ! Hi aunt ! Hi Khushi... He got her ! Thanks. How did you recognise her? You did not give me details about her, ok... But you have sent all my details to her? I forgot that I had sent your details on WhatsApp...

Mr. Vijay Yes Vijay... Your children should not have done like this to us. I know its a mistake... big mistake. They should not have done like this. Dont get panic, Vijay... I am there for you. Next week my daughter is getting married in Pune.. I will send the invitation... You come over, we solve the problems. OK. See you, bye. Cheers ! Why there are so many people in front of the house? They have come to eat in the name of a dead person... What do you mean? Means, annual ritual. Whose? It is 14th death anniversary of Mrs. Pushpalatha Gaikwad. How did she die? She had a troubled marriage and so... So? Committed suicide. Since then, this program happens every year. What program? Firstly, the family members and friends perform pooja. After that? Food... After that? Then, food donation in the orphanage. After that? Old age home. After that? Home for blinds. After that? Bar. Bar? Milk bar? Goondas will drink alcohol in bar. I would have been very happy if I was born in the house of a poor instead of this rich family. Why madam? Why are you saying this? Real happiness lies in poverty, Shankar. Why are you laughing? Nothing. Tell me, no problem. One minute, I will come there. Please hold it. Donating food, clothes, fruit once a year and showing that off as a big charity activity with lot of selfies and scope, is not life ! It is important to know how a poor person lives his life. Are you all happy in poverty? None of you have any problems? I have financial problem for my daughters marriage. What about you? Parents and grandmother are in hospital brother... OK, sit. What about you? Auto finance, house rent, school fees, full problem. Bro, I dont have money, bro. My girlfriend has left me... I have cut my hand and drinking alcohol full day. Madam will solve all your problems. Please sit. Common problem for all poor people is money. Rich people will have varieties of problem. None of the rich people on this earth can be happy. I will prove you wrong. Will you leave the work? You are absolutely correct, madam. OK, if you lose? I will give whatever you ask for. Remember this dialogue correctly... you are the umpire for this. This old man is a multi-millionaire. Yes. But he is not happy. Naughty girl. His wife passed away 20 years ago. He is living in that pain every day. This man? You should be innocent but not foolish. He is flirting with 12 ladies. One dozen? None is of use. Apart from these 12, there is a 13th one also... Umadevi. Dont talk rubbish. Find out. Hi Nisha. Sorry, kept you waiting. Hi uncle. Dont call me uncle... I am still young. Call me Chaudhary. Chaudhary, do you know Umadevi? She is my 13th queen. Women, gold and land come only by luck. Such luck ! Everyone lose their peace for money You are right. We both have money. We should be peaceful. Get married as soon as possible. Spoke a good thing. Julie... one minute I might have missed that one... but I wont miss this. The person over there is John. He is on dialysis every day since three years. Doctor has given him five months of time. Pity him ! He has donated all his wealth and has settled here. This is outside story.. inside story is something else. He was fearing CBI raid and has donated his property to himself. You did not understand? He is one of the core members of this trust. A poor man in his place would have faced hell in a hospital. A middle class person would have been in jail. He is not sad as you think... he is enjoying and is happy. No chance. Go and verify. Hi uncle ! Hi Nisha ! Come and sit. I got to know that you have a lot of health problems. Actually, I have come here for relaxation. My business has also raised because of sympathy towards my bad health. You got to know of all these things before coming here? Or did you already know it? In between. In between? Yes, in between. Great sir. I will also check. Go. Oh darling, one more shot please. Uncle, drinks? Drinks is also medicine. This also is fake... I will call you later. Meeting is cancelled. Sir, Suresh... No, Suresh you are fired ! You are fired ! Meet Mr. Ramesh Patil. Hi, hi ! 75 companies owner, five techno park, 750 crore investment... Yours? Yes, ask. Sir is very rich. None of the rich person on this earth lives in peace.. full of frustration ! Sir is very rich. I dont have time to eat, sleep, bath, anything. Madam, can I eat the burjer? That is not burjer, that is sandwich. Frustration ! I dont know what to say and what to eat. Sir is very rich. Now at least you accept your defeat? Tell me. Our boy and your girl, How is the online thing going on? Nothing is there...no one sees it. No money, full loss. With whom do I share my problems? X-channel online? It is very good... I watch it daily. Only one viewer... how can I earn? Opened the mouth ! Its the question of survival... that is why I came here. Madam, all this does not suit me. I already told you. Yes, rich. Why is she troubling me? Sir is very rich ! What rich? Let us go... She did not understand that we are caught red handed. Sir is very rich. Sir is very rich. We wont get money, come along. Wanting to win is not wrong, Winning in wrong route is wrong. Come on lets start the party. Do you accept the defeat? No chance at all ! These are all kids of rich people. They are not happy. They have come to forget their pains. These people? Hello, I will prove it. Yes. Go, prove it. Hello brother ! Greetings, greetings ! How are you? Fine! I want to ask you something. Go ahead. Are you in pain? Pain? No pain. All ok, good vibes only. He should be very rich. What work do you do? No work.. Just enjoying party with girls. Come on baby... uncle is just irritating. Hi uncle. Madam, at that age I did not have money to buy even a candy. Money rules. Do you accept your defeat now? How do I accept? Am I happy? Dont know who will attack when ! Am I not living with a security guard like you. Ok, I loose. What next? What do you want? Watch, ATM card, what do you want? Are you crying? No. There is just water in eyes. I dont want any of those... just give me a kiss, thats it. Kiss? What? We should maintain the standard of this pub. I asked just for one kiss, thats it. Come on, give. You had promised to give whatever I ask for. Give it now. Madam, listen to me madam. Give it. You should not break a promise... go ahead and give. It wont suit you. Will take it next time. He did not take the free kiss too. Happiness to hurt someones ego is out of the world. He is performing the marriage in our territory leaving his own, something is fishy. Family name is very big. I will go with entire family. Hello brother ! Please come. Hello, only guests. It is not enough to have a gun in your pocket, You should also have guts. Enemies are there 360 degrees around. Hey, stop ! Security. Lets play a game! Sure. Vijay treats me as his elder brother. How many times have I mentioned that we are all one family. He just does not listen to me. Your turn. You will be shocked to know one more matter. He was ready to capture entire Bangalore. Cunning fellow. I scolded and stopped him. I asked him to go an warn one of our customers, He came back with his head ! Dangerous boys ! They dont value emotions, Vijay. Check mate. There is no value in a game after the demise of the king. You have made good money and name, Vijay. I think that is enough. Get retired. Thats it? Dont take this as a warning, Take it as a suggestion. You got my father killed, brother? No. Not at all. Why are you not eating the breakfast? Waiting for the good news. What good news? Gaikwad will not reach Bangalore. He has sold Bengal... They will kill everyone. This is really good news. Enjoy the moment man. Have breakfast. Bad boys ! Enough of lions blood... Now play with human blood. Kill everyone. Celebrate it ! Mother ! Khushi... Khushi... Khushi... Mother... Khushi... Khushi Mother... No sir... dont waste the bullet. Nisha... Nisha... Brother ! Nisha. Nisha Brother Nisha Brother... I felt that day that something is not right. Enemy who knows everything about is more dangerous than the one who knows nothing about us. He is very strong as of now. We must be silent. Correct sir... be silent. He will attack again... And then complete silent mode. What are you saying? There were 12 people for breakfast this morning. There is no one for dinner now. Completely injured. This is not the time to discuss. It is the time to decide. Start a new company or invite them for party meeting or invite them for your sisters engagement, sir. They have served you food in a wedding, You give them return gifts along with food. You should not keep credits for too long. Dont talk without knowing everything about him. Please. Sorry sir. We need thousands of good decisions to establish an empire. But just one wrong decision can collapse it. I have the faith that you will follow this. Yes Vijay, tell me. As my father is no more, I dont need this business. I give up. You will leave everything? You children are like my brothers. Let them continue. Very good decision, Vijay. Very good. It is good to stay away from bad people. See you soon. Sure. Hey guys ! Yes dad. He got scared ! Lets start our new game. Santosh. My sister is getting engaged in 12 days. Plan the schedule correctly. Yes sir. \{Chattering\} I cant see someone putting the ring to girls finger who was supposed to be yours. I am hurt... What about you, boss? This is not wedding, it is just ring ceremony. You have a future plan? Welcome ! Congratulations! Thank you. Those three people are giving weird looks. I have some program with them... they will be fine after I finish it. Bye. Hey babe... Hello. What is your name? Preethi. Nice name... Thank you. Yes brother... I am in the pub. OK, coming. Babe, I will be back soon. OK. Yes gentlemen, enjoy ! Cheers. Cheers.. Cheers ! Lets play the game. Sure. How is the business doing, brother? Doing fine. My father really liked you a lot. Very nice man. Sorry. I was shocked to hear the news. This should not have happened. Thats destiny ! God calls all the good people very soon. Two minutes, I will come. Hey babe ! Preethi... You did not find the girl? Who is that? Guest... What are you doing here? I have come here to rest you in peace forever. You will kill me? I expected you to come when my father passed away. I tried a lot to come but business commitments, overseas trips. I couldnt make it. Its OK. But, I miss him a lot. Yes Pranav. But at this time... I will be back. You should be very strong, Vijay. Hello... Hello Pranav... Hello... Shit ! Cheers ! Hey security, where is Pranav? He is waiting up for you. Kill him... My father always used to tell not to compete in relationship. He used to respect emotions, a lot. Even I respect emotions, a lot, Vijay. Nowadays, it is very important to safeguard relationships. Hey, stop! How long will you search for the dead one. Waste... Shoot him. It is not enough to have gun, you should also have guts. Courage is always around me, 360 degrees. I can forgive my enemy for once... But I can never forget an enemy who cheats being a friend ! What are you saying, Vijay? Check mate. King is with me. I dont want this company. What will you do with the business without your sons, Ratan? Take a permanent retirement. Ashok, Pranav, Vikram... Rest in peace ! Sir, Vijay killed Ratan and he has occupied the whole business. Everything is fine. We are back to form. All sub-ordinates are in our control. Trust and fear on us has increased. Leave for India immediately... Attack Vijay Gaikwad... Destroy his entire kingdom... I want to see him dead. Yes sir. As expected, the share value of our company is increasing. Cargo consignment details from the port will get confirmed tomorrow morning. Cheers ! Cheers... cheers ! You have come to kill Vijay Gaikwad from such a long distance... What is the reason? He sent a man... a single man Who came from a far land He destroyed the kingdom, devils kingdom. I am in a lot of confusion since my father passed away... I dont have the clarity about who are my friends and who are the enemies... Along with me, you have saved the lives of my family members too. Unknowingly, you have helped a lot for my business. I trust you ! My father has left me with two responsibilities. Firstly, this business... second, my sister. This week is most crucial for our business. Take care of her this week. Its a request. OK sir. Santosh ! How did you bring here without asking me? I can file a case on you. I am talking... Hello Sorry Nisha... its for your good. Please adjust for this one week. I will tell you in detail once I am back. OK brother. He is organising the business secretly. He has kept his sister safely in Madikeri. Team is ready... We will kill his sister first. Stop here, brother! -Hello, brother! -Hello! My name is Biddappa. She is my wife, Dechamma. Santosh, the situation is not right. Please be alert. Yes sir. Santosh... Brother, she's into labor pains. Call the Doctor urgently. Please get the car fasy, brother. I beg for your help, please brother. Coming. Be careful. Mother ! My baby! I never knew what is happiness... I lost my mother at a very early age, And then Singapore boarding school... I never had friends... I used to wait for my birthday every year... Not to celebrate... My dad might come to see me on that day... I spent my life among the house helpers and security guards... I finished my medicine study a year ago but had forgotten that I am a doctor... Yesterday, for the first time, I helped in the delivery of a baby... Please bare it for some more time... First time when I saw you in the Ashram, I dont know whether you liked me or not... But I liked you a lot. After you saved our family, I feel every breath of ours is a gift from you. I love you Santosh ! Go... He is not receiving the call... I think he is gone Shit. Standing on the waterfalls of my eyes, My heart is singing a melody, Defeated by the attraction of your beauty and silence I started following you with bare hands ! Your company is enthralling You are the owner of my dreams, It is my fortune to have you in my life I am your fan, undoubtedly ! I am your bodyguard, Will safeguard you, throughout life. I am your bodyguard, Will safeguard you, throughout life. I am fortunate to have you in my life I am your fan, undoubtedly! OK, I will update tomorrow. Take coffee... Thank you. I feel it will be nice to have Santosh as a family member rather than a security... He is a good match for Nisha. Just a suggestion. Decision is yours. This is where the meeting happens. This is first security check... this is second one... this is third one. From here to here, distance 0.75kms. Be on full alert and attack with care. He has organised a business meeting for tomorrow, sir. This time we wont miss the target, sir. Burn them all. Hi everyone ! Lets welcome our chairman, Mr. Vijay Gaikwad, on stage please. Gaikwad groups welcomes you all ! Who is that? Get down. Get down. I would like to welcome my dear sister, Nisha Gaikwad, on stage !

All five of us celebrate our birthday on this friendship day. This place has not only given us food and education but a new life altogether. This is a home for thousands like us. The responsibility of these kids is yours henceforth. I have the belief that these children will become good human beings after being groomed in this Ashram. Sure. Greetings.

May you keep learning forever If our soul is pure, God will be within us. If the childhood is good, life will surely be good ! By Gods grace, this friendship is strong since childhood and will remain the same lifelong. Happy to know. How much more does the heart wants, oh Lord !

I am a reporter sir. I did not like... ask me why... Why sir? Dont ask.. I am a retired captain. I have served for 30 years in Vishakapatnam Navy. Sir, you fought on water... we fight on land. Absolutely ! Infact, Ekanth mentioned it... Glad to know, sir. I am not glad. I did not like. Ask me why... Why sir? What if my daughter wants to marry the friend of my son in law? I did not like. I did not like initially... when a friend of mine mentioned that you are from army, I liked it. I agreed immediately. Ask me why. Because you like Military ! Correct... I will tell you a story.

The real game starts after marriage... Rest is all fine... May the praise be with almighty. Jai Hind, colonel ! Hi sir. I am very happy to know your thoughts, culture and ideas. What? Happiness. Did you like it? You spoke well... but I did not understand. Even I did not understand... Tell me if there is any work, sir. I will report... I will support. I liked this. Did you like it, sir? It was a little difficult... Sir, flowers... Coming, coming. Am I lesser than anyone... he had to like me ! I will not leave till he likes me. My brothers did not listen to me and came to India. Now they are in NCB custody. I need your help, Vijay. I will be on your terms in business. This is a very sensitive issue. Our entire business might collapse even with a small negligence. But still, I will try my best. You can contact me anytime for any problem. Hello... business is now turning towards us. This is the time to take risk... Lets take the risk. He is our boss, show a good photo... Dont play... he is a big man. But he is only this much. Introduce yourself. Hello sir, good morning. Sir has given all the information about you. Sir, have a look. I have all the types of girls from ABCD to XYZ. If you select a photo, I will get her and her familys biodata sir. Sir, have a look. This girl is very rich... She never travels on land... she is always in flight. If you say yes, I will get her. Look at this girl.. she is a fairy... But it is difficult to convince her... She does not like any boy... Do you like her? Look at this girl sir... such a homely girl. But she does not know any household work, sir. She is always busy with Swiggy and Zomato... Adjustment gives satisfaction in life, sir. I get satisfaction in getting people married. Do you have any demands, sir? One request... I dont want a match which gives priority only to income. I have decided to live for my country. OK sir. I have come here to attend his wedding... So let us not talk about my marriage.. Ok sir. He took a U-turn... If I like some girl, I will tell it to everyone. I will tell you too.. Did you get it? Good luck.. -You are also rejected.. get lost. -Sir! -Will you have some juice? -No sir! Ok then leave... What is this sir? I have seen people who sacrifice their wealth for a girl... I have seen people abandoning their parents for a girl... But for the first time I am seeing someone sacrificing dreams for the country ! Thats why we say that soldiers are real heroes. Sir, hats off to you sir. Thank you sir. Will take your leave, sir. Everything is in control sir... nothing to worry. I will keep updating, sir. Ok. Hi Jagan, did you finish your work? All ok? Actually, I wanted to share something with you. Tell me. Three months ago, my colleagues brother Shravanth... he is an engineering student... He committed suicide. While investigating the case, I got to know that he was into drugs peddling. We arrested a few peddlers... We got a major information from them... International drug peddlers have come to Bangalore for a collaboration... We formed a special team and planned a secret operation... We arrested four people. What we found out in our investigation was... That they are not peddlers, they are drug lords. And they belong to the most notorious cartel, the Golden Horse. Our further investigation revealed that two major drug syndicates are active in India too.. Investigation is on... It will be a big sensation if this news breaks out, Major. Actually, the credit goes to them.. They have given a lot of information. Cheers... Good job... Thank you Major. I will share a few things that I know. Our recent terrorist operation was also drug related... I see. Drugs, illegal arms, human trafficking, all these are a huge business. There is a lot of money involved. You cant even imagine. People are ready to take any amount of risk , when the money involved is so huge. Big people will be involved. We should not touch such people. If you touch, you should kill them. Otherwise, we will remain as only news on television My suggestion... It is good to produce them to court as soon as possible. Secondly, security... It is very important for you and your family to have security whether you are at work or on a holiday.. Thirdly, please stay alert. It will be good to be as alert as possible. Yes Major. Be safe. Yeah. Sir, I knew you are a terror... even your friends are same.. You heard everything? Yes sir. That is why we say, you can know about a person based on his company. You are an expert in that. Come sir. Sorry for rejecting your suggestion. Thank you for helping us. They have the guts to arrest you. They are not scared of what could happen to them if they arrest. Show them what is fear. Sure... They should face the same insult, pain and embarrassment which you faced when you were arrested. Show them hell. Yes. Where are you? Parangi, did you see my wife anywhere? What did you say? Parangi. It is not Parangi.. it is Pirangi. Sorry sir. My father Hulinayaka Pirangi... My grandfather Aanenayaka Pirangi My great grandfather Jamatandi Pirangi. Ours is a royal family ! You should not call wrong names. You will be cursed. Who sir? People who have invited you also will be cursed. And people who are called will also be cursed. Sir, where have you kept it? -What? -Cannon... Its the symbol of family to be used only during war.. It wont rust? We keep oiling it time to time... with oil and sweet. Madan, you are here ! Naina is looking for you everywhere... come. You can clean cannon with sweet? What? Nothing... lets go. We should be careful while talking to this man. Otherwise he will turn the cannon towards us. Greetings sir ! Sir, you did not narrate the story... Story... 1971, Ghazi attack... severe war between India and Pakistan... It was huge... Very troublesome... In Pakistan? I am emotional as my daughter will go to her wedded house tomorrow morning... I know... I know. I am soldier.. I should not become weak. I know.. give me a minute. I was telling the story... will tell it later. Sir. It is such an auspicious moment sir... friends who love you more than anything, a family which is so proud of you... It is so nice to see them. Nowadays, even own siblings dont stay like this.. We dont share same blood... but we have grown up sharing same problems. Love is eternal... May your love remain like this forever... May there be no evil sight on this friendship... I pray to God that you should always remain happy like this. Thank you for getting me along, sir. Santosh, you are here... I was looking for you.. I will tell the story... Sure. Sir... tell the story, sir. Story... shall we sit and talk. Sure sir. Actually, 1971... Ghazi attack... India Pakistan war... terrible sight... Go ahead sir. Sir...

Santosh ! Mother... mother... Ammu... Father... father... Major... Mother.. mother... mother.. Madan ! Father, please come... Father, let us go... Father, please talk... Jagan... Major... Are you scared? Is it hurting? Are you shy? You arrested us, got a gold medal and dreamt of being permanent in history.. Now you will have a bad chapter in history ! They took drugs in the marriage party and shot each other after a clash over a petty matter. IAS, IPS officers on high... This is the breaking news ! Happy journey. Good luck ! Rest in peace. Sir... sir.. Santosh sir ! Sir, wake up.. Sir... I will tell the story... get up. I will tell the story.. get up. Ghazi attack... 1971... India Pakistan war...

Only two people survived of them all... Saanvi and Santosh sir. After 20 days of fight between life and death, Santosh sir gained his conscious. Sir... sir... Sir... In our country, money can close many matters. Similarly, this incidence did not become serious at all. Next day, Saanvi passed away ! Oh God ! Soil, soil... you have put the life in soil You have given such a pain Oh God ! Where are you hiding after burning all dreams You have done such a blunder Oh God ! You are a cheater, who makes us laugh and then makes us cry You are a player, who gives everything but snatches them away too Oh God, we condemn you till our last breath Give me back the lives that you have taken away Oh God, we condemn you for your deeds I will not forgive you till my last breath Oh my God ! Soil, soil... you have put the life in soil You have given such a pain Where are you hiding after burning all dreams You have done such a blunder Who targeted like this and why? We had to find answers for these questions. We tried to collect the information about the enemies. We start the analysation about their place, behaviour, everything. Robin, John and Peter... You carry on... I will talk to you later. Hello... who is this? James. James, are you my friend? Enemy ! Enemy... You have killed my friends... You have killed a beautiful family... You have hurt me a lot... Mark my words, I will take revenge... I will separate your brothers from you.. I will show you, what is pain ! And finally, I will kill you ! You are welcome ! James is his code name in Military. He kept that name in memory of his friends... His words were not mere words that day... They were a roar... Cheers ! cheers ! Enjoy everyone ! Hello Peter, where are you? Wish you a very Happy Birthday Robin ! I am waiting for you man, come soon... I have some work... will finish and join the party as soon as possible. Come on everybody... Happy Birthday to you ! Happy Birthday to you ! Happy Birthday to dear Robin ! Happy birthday to you ! Cheers ! Happy Birth.... Guards... what happened? Hey, look what happened? Lights on... Where is Robin? Robin... Robin.. Search for Robin... Look there... John... John... Robin... Robin... what happened? Robin.. Robin... Who are you? Hey Robin ! Go search.... Search... Good luck ! Hello... Hello, dear brother ! Peter, are you ok? Yeah, I am OK. What happened? Why are you so tensed? Robin is dead ! What are you saying? Peter... Peter.. Peter... Peter.... Peter... John... Peter... Happy Journey ! Search there... Where are you? Come on... Come... Come No... dont kill him... No... Rest in peace ! You did not take us seriously.. We are facing huge losses. Even my son does not like to do business with you. We are cancelling the deal. Sir, Gaikwad groups has quit from our Syndicate. Our sea enters are trying to track information about the killers. OK. Sea enters of Joseph Anthony were looking for Santosh sir in the sea for a week... But I and Santosh were in Brigadiers office. Your intention was right... But the path you selected was absolutely wrong ! Being a soldier, without informing the authority, crossing the border was your first big mistake. Killing so many people for your personal revenge is your second big mistake.. Actually, under the military code of conduct, I should court martial you.. But, considering your service to the nation, you are excused. Get well soon and report to me as soon as possible. Tell me now, who is bad? Your brother who is spoiling the entire country? Or Santosh who is cleaning the entire country? He is not bad.. he is good ! Very good... stupid girl ! Close this... Sir, Santosh sir.. What? Office is ruined, sir. Sir... Hi, Mr. James... Anthony... Joseph Anthony. Are you shocked? Are you great as you are fighting for your friends? Or am I great as I am fighting for my brothers? Let us decide. I accepted your challenge and came to India... Now, you listen carefully to me. Without using my power and money, within three days, I will call you in front of me... I will call you to my place... I am waiting... waiting for my revenge ! What do we do now sir? There are only two rules in a war. Either the enemy kills us or we kill them ! Be prepared ! Yes sir. It is important to understand people in life... but avoiding misunderstandings is also equally important. Just one misunderstanding... and I lost the affection of my best friend because of the emotions on my brothers.. I decided to kill.. I am sorry for that. He ruined our empire, killed my brother, fooled us and is now challenging us... He is dangerous ! Our people have gone to his place, beaten up his men and saved these guys... so I feel killing him is not a very difficult task. Dont underestimate him ! You have only seen him talking... I have seen him fighting.. Single handed he beats up an entire army of men... Its not a joke. He is demon.. He is right... planning is more important than power here.. Instead of tackling him in a straight way, let us do it in another way. It must be a lesson for our enemies... Cheers ! Santosh... please dont cut the call.. I want to talk something urgent. Please meet me Please. Otherwise I will commit suicide ! Santosh... My respect for you has increased after knowing your story... My brother, family, they are all bad.. I agree. But, there is nothing wrong in the love that I have for you, Santosh... I not only like you but also your principles. You have so much emotions on your friends... Did you not connect with my love and emotions even for a day, Santosh? I know that you like me too... Please, dont go away ! Please, accept me Santosh... Wont you accept, Santosh? My brother will hand over the business to me and I will be the chairman of the company... this had been my dream since many years! You spoilt everything... You thought I will spare you so easily ? No way... You know who is the gangster? Do you know the power of gangster? One who builds an empire wherever he is, conquers business, challenges and destroys all his enemies... Real gangster ! We have come to this position after killing many like you... If you know to cheat by acting as a close aide, dont I know to cheat with the help of my sister? Cheater ! I will spare even if you touch my sons but I wont spare you if you hamper my business.. I never expected you to be such a weak competitor... Here, at this very instance, hundred bullets will be shot inside your body. I will give you a chance... Before dying, if you have any last words to say, go ahead. I like friends... I like my country a lot... Fire! I will destroy the entire drug syndicate, sir... I will not let any drug syndicate to remain active in India, sir... I will fulfil the intention of my friends, sir ! I was so desperate to hear this energy ! A special opportunity is waiting for you... We are assigning you to lead the special covet operation, mission NORC ! Choose your team. Yes sir ! Are you ready soldiers? Yes sir. Are you ready for the operation? Yes sir.. Jai Hind ! Jai Hind ! If you are a gangster, I am a soldier ! Do you know who is a soldier? One who leaves all desires and think about the country every moment... Soldier ! I will give you a chance.. None of them will use the guns, beat up ! Nisha ! Sorry brother... My emotion on country is more than my emotion on brother... Do you really like me? Will you do whatever I say? Yes... You planned everything... but I executed it. Money, fame earned in a wrong way will not last forever.. But whatever is earned in the right way, is everlasting... Soil, soil... you have put the life in soil You have given such a pain Oh God ! Where are you hiding after burning all dreams You have done such a blunder Oh God ! You are a cheater, who makes us laugh and then makes us cry You are a player, who gives everything but snatches them away too Oh God, we condemn you till our last breath Give me back the lives that you have taken away Oh God, we condemn you for your deeds I will not forgive you till my last breath Oh my God ! We all slept deeply this night There are no stars this night Get up, get up, we are waiting for you We will have to sleep crying, if you arent there. Oh God, we condemn you till our last breath Give me back the lives that you have taken away Oh God, we condemn you for your deeds I will not forgive you till my last breath
