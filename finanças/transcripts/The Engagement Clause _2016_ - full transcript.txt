You have a 4 a.m. conference call with New York in the morning. I need you to review and sign these. - These are done. - Oh, great. Excellent. - Here you go. Pen. All right. - No. And I need you to decide between this generic holiday goose with a bow around its neck, or this winter wonderland cabin for this year's P.C. corporate holiday card. Shouldn't there be a picture of fruit or a chocolate manger or something? We're a food distribution company. I don't make the cards, I just sign your name to em. Okay, um... goose. You can eat that, right? Yeah, if you live in a Dickens novel. Oh, can you put out a memo that we're gonna close up shop early tomorrow for Thanksgiving Eve, please? Really? Does that privilege extend to your humble assistant? - It does. - Are you going soft on me? No. I have plenty to do, but Mom's forcing me to come over and stuff a Turducken. Why in the world would your mother let you cook? Because the professional chef in the family is bringing home her new boyfriend. - Ooh! Have you met him yet? - No, no one has. But, um, Katie says there's some big surprise, so while you're at it, can you make me a list of wedding venues, a spreadsheet, because the girl is as transparent as tissue paper. - Oh! That's so exciting! - Is it? You're such a grump before you have any caffeine. Here. Oh, speaking of which, don't forget you have coffee with your dad at 5:00. Oh! He wants to go over the Rowling Vineyards proposal. Well, as the person that personally piloted your exhaustive research, I can assure you, you're prepared. I'm gonna ask him to let me run the deal. - Go team! - Oh, by the way, did you finalize the rentals for the holiday office party? - Yep. - Fantastic. I want everything to be perfect. You guys deserve it. Basically, my whole goal is for everyone to have so much fun that their head explodes. That's festive. Oh, also, can you Google Turducken? Oh, yes. It's a chicken stuffed inside of a duck stuffed inside of a turkey. Okay, I'm gonna need some rubber gloves. Katie's engaged. Mm! Love is in the air. So is the swine flu, Zelda. Don't offend Cupid, Carrie Tate. He could have an arrow with your name on it. Oh! Mm-mm. How do you misspell "Mark"? Oh! With a hint of irony and extra foam, apparently. - That is-- I mean, cheers. - Cheers. Mm. So, Dad, a golf game, coffee. Plan on making it into the office anytime soon? I don't have to be a workaholic anymore, because you've taken over that job. Oh, okay! So I can have your big corner office too? - Wonderful. - Patience, grasshopper. When have you ever known me to have patience? - Ah... - I can, however, rock a spreadsheet. - The cover art's impressive. - I try. Okay. So, Rowling Vineyards. They're a winery in Napa. And just this last year, their entire Pinot crop was destroyed by black rot and now they're on the verge of bankruptcy. - Mm-hm. - So I believe that we could recoup our entire initial investment in, listen to this, six months, if we just streamline operations. - You're talking about layoffs? - That's a sticking point. So the company currently has about 25 full-time employees. And the family's very concerned for their welfare so they want everyone kept on. - So how do you get around that? - We don't necessarily have to. They aren't utilizing their resources to the fullest potential, and we would bring them into national distribution. Dad? I want to run this deal by myself. Carrie, if you hadn't asked, I would have offered it to you anyway. - You're ready. - I know. And humble, too. Yeah. Well, Emerson Foods is everything to me, Dad. I know, Care-Bear. But please don't forget to take a day off now and then. You know, just to give the cleaning lady a chance to vacuum your office. - Thank you. - Shows what you know, sir. I gave my entire team off tomorrow afternoon. Hm! Hm! You can't fool me. Hm! 'Cause I know that you were called home for kitchen duty by Sergeant Bitsy. Yes. Uh... Yeah, I think she just wants someone to gush to over Katie's new boy. Ah, yes. The big surprise. Katie's in love. Your mother is all atwitter about it. Munchkin, try to keep her from driving your sister crazy - when she gets in. - Promise. Good. That's my girl. Oh, please, don't. Okay. You know what? The next time you go golfing, you should get one of those Scottish hats with the big pom-pom, and do this and... it demands respect. Truly. - Yes. - Now you know what to get me for Christmas. Mm! Oh, my goodness. Look at how cute we are. Oh, my God. You are gorgeous. I can't wait till Carrie gets here. You're gonna love her. - Hello! - She's here! Hi! Ethan, I am exceptionally pleased to introduce you to my sister, Carrie. Her beauty is only surpassed by her business acumen. - Oh, stop. - I am so glad to finally meet you. - Me too. - Oh, no, no, no! I don't shake hands. - I'm a hugger. - Okay! - Okay! Ah! - Ah! Hi! Wow! So this is the famous Ethan. Tell me, how did you manage to drag this one away from her restaurant? Oh, I didn't. I am one of her vendors. Mm! Ethan has a prospering organic farm. We serve his vegetables at the restaurant, - and they are simply stunning. - Thanks, babe. Well played, Ethan. If anything can turn this one's head, - it's an heirloom tomato. - He also forages. - Oh. - Mm-hm. Truffles... - Uh-huh. Wow. - ...mushrooms, and pine nuts. - Hm... - He's a trailblazer in the wild food movement. - I teach a class on it. - So you just find food? Like a mountain man or...? Basically, but with a little less beard. Mm-hm. It's an impactful skill to possess. - I'm sure. - We will never starve so long as I have these. - Let's eat. - Carrie, you really have to come up to Napa. You haven't been to the restaurant since the opening and I know that you would love Ethan's farm. - I know. I'm sure. - We're harvesting Brussels sprouts. It's a blast! Thanks, but, you know, I'm just-- I've been so swamped with work, Katie. And it's... it's my baby. And my boyfriend. And my weekends and my vacations, and, uh... - But I love it, so and... - That is exactly how I feel about the restaurant. Hey, what about me? Well, you, darling, are my sun, my moon, and my sky. - Oh! There she is! - Hi, Mom. Hi, honey. Dinner is served. Hope they don't sit us in the kids' table. He's such a jokester. Ethan, I totally love that you're growing some of the vegetables or whatever. But, Katie, when am I going to get you to accept an Emerson Food contract? Uh, well, you know, I really am trying to be more farm-to-table. What are-- It's not like we sell vegetables grown in outer space. I just like to have a relationship with the farmers that I buy from. - Mm. Clearly, you do. - Okay. Is this a really appropriate Thanksgiving dinner conversation? Fine. Fine, no business talk at the table. That's right. You promised. So what is this surprise you have for us, Miss Katie? - Hm... - You're pregnant, aren't you? - Oh, Katie! Are you? - What? - No! You are terrible! - Come on, Katie, we can tell 'em. We will tell them at the right moment and not a second sooner. Ooh. Practically perfect Katie has a plan. Perpetually pesky Carrie will annoy her older sister. And in the meantime, my Turducken is getting cold. That's right. Shall we call a truce, girls? Fine. Only in the name of warm Turducken. - Mm-hm! To warm Turducken! - Hear! Hear! To my warm Turducken. - Mom! - I've always loved your warm Turducken, darling. - Oh, stop! - Jesus! Dad! I would like to say something. I am full of gratitude this year. My restaurant is doing magnificently. I have a loyal and gracious staff. They are just so talented. And I am so very inspired. I'm thankful for my family. You all have offered nothing but love and support. And I am very, very thankful for this divine man sitting right here. I know I told you all that I have a surprise, so clear your calendars for Christmas Eve because you are invited to a holiday wedding! We're engaged! Oh, my Katie! Oh, congratulations! Wonderful! I never would have guessed! - Oh! - You'll be the most beautiful bride! - Mom, thank you! - Welcome to the family. Okay! All right! - Yeah. I already knew. - You know everything. Okay, so this one right here? I think it looks darn close to perfect, don't you? - I think so. - Oh! Is the game over, boys? - Don't ask. - I'm sorry, honey. But you know what? I'm really glad you're here, 'cause I could use your help. Hi. Girls, Ethan. Your mother and I have something we'd like to discuss with you. Maybe we should have some more eggnog first. Uh-oh! Mom's plying us with alcohol and hospitality, Katie. - It must be serious. - Dad, please don't let this be some ridiculous family initiation for Ethan. I've only just secured his undying love. Don't make him regret the decision. We just need to discuss some family business. Um, it's about your grandmother. - What's wrong with Nana? - Nana's fine. No, your grandmother Lucille, about her... about her will, actually. Her will? Mark? Okay. God, I don't know how to say this. Okay. My mother had some very strong feelings about certain things, like gender roles. She was just... - Old-fashioned? - Yes. Stiff as a board is more like it. One time she took us slip shopping because a proper young lady - never leaves the house... - Without appropriate undergarments! Do you remember when she made us learn how to fold the napkins into little swans - and we'd chuck them off the balcony? - Swan dive! - Swan dive! - Okay, girls. Please, please. Okay, just let me get through this. So when Daddy died, he left the company entirely to my mother, who didn't believe that women should be involved in business, so when she passed, she didn't leave the company to me. She left it to... one of you. Which one of us? She had a provision in her will that whichever one of you marries first, the company would immediately go to that daughter's husband. - Mom, that's not funny. - I know. - It's really not. - Dad, come on. - Honey, please. Please. - What?! Why didn't you tell us about this? Because I did not want to spark some sort of competition between the two of you. What does... what does this mean? Well, it means that after you and Ethan get married, legally... Ethan will own Emerson Foods. Okay, this is ridiculous! There has to be something we can do about this! Believe me, I under-- We have tried. We have been to so many attorneys over the years. This is so unfair! Dad, come on! Okay, Carrie has worked so hard. - Emerson Food is her dream. - Thank you. I don't want the company. This isn't right. - Carrie, I will give it to you. - Okay. Katie, let's just think about this for a minute. What is that supposed to mean? I just don't think Katie should be so hasty. This is a big deal, and maybe everybody should sleep on it before we make any big decisions. You don't have to make any decisions! None of this has anything to do with you! Well, apparently, I do. - Okay, um... - This is exactly what I didn't want to have happen. I am so sorry, honeys. We have tried on this, but our hands are tied. Carrie, we can figure this out. That's really easy for you to say. Honey, I know why you're angry. You have every right-- We're gonna get through this. Okay? We're gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be fine. Nothing's set in stone. The whole point of this conversation is that it's set in stone! Be quiet, please! Carrie, stop yelling at Ethan! - Katie, just let her get it out. - You know what? No! You know what? Never mind. Why don't we all just decorate for Christmas! Oh, everyone! Be careful, don't put Mrs. Santa above Santa. We wouldn't want her to get any ideas about taking over. Really, Dad? Honey... Dad! Mr. Courtney. - Mark Tate. - Dylan Courtney. Pleasure. - Hi, Carrie Tate. - Hi, Carrie. Pleasure. This is-- you already met-- my assistant. - We didn't shake. Soft. - Oh! - Can we offer you some coffee? - No, I'm fine. Thank you. - Okay. - All right, that's... - Oh, okay, all right. Bye! - Oh. Bye. I'm-- I'm sorry. I thought that I was speaking with Tom or Marilyn today. No, the Rowlings retained me as independent counsel. - I see. - Shall we begin? Oh, of course. First off, just let it be known that the only reason why the Rowlings are doing this is because they want to secure their employees' jobs. I mean, they never wanted to be swallowed by a bigger fish. Well, Emerson Foods is a family company. It is. A very big family company with a very different vision. What exactly do you mean by that? Well, it means the Rowlings are a little gun-shy about being co-opted by a company who could turn their 100-year-old family vineyard into something that slings wine coolers. I understand, and I agree, actually. But they'd rather die on their artisanal swords than go corporate? They'd like to preserve the character of the company. Right. I'm just not sure they're in any position to be picky, Mr. Courtney. Listen, we're both aware that this is the perfect opportunity for Emerson Foods to move into the alcoholic beverages market. Yes. Be that as it may, I don't think there are many companies out there willing to take on a failing vineyard. That may be true, but what they really need is some guidance. What they really need is some help. I'm-- I'm sorry, maybe we misunderstood. We're not here to offer consultation services. That's understood, but I'm also not here to offer up my clients' company to the first bidder out of fear. Mr. Courtney, I think you misunderstand the nature-- - I think I understand perfectly. - Let's just cut to the chase. We're prepared to make an offer today. That's a ridiculous offer. - I disagree. - I'm sure you do. Okay. This was a waste of time. Mr. Courtney, I think it's a very generous offer. Well, here's what I'll do. I will take your generous offer to the Rowlings and I'll see what they have to say. - Until then, nice meeting you. - Mr. Courtney. - Ms. Tate. - No, please. Don't let us keep you. You clearly have urgent plans to get somewhere, so... I'll be in touch later this week with a counter offer. Thank you. Okay, okay, okay. Hi, Carrie. It's Michelle Sullivan. Listen, I've gone over the will and, unfortunately, your only recourse is going to be convincing your future brother-in-law to sign the company over to you after the wedding. When and if Katie marries first, Emerson Foods will pass to her husband. I'm sorry I can't give you better news. Was that The Hunger Games over here? - Huh? - Mr. Courtney. No, I really-- I don't have time to think about that. My entire life is crumbling before my very eyes. - That was the lawyer on the phone? - Yes. When and if Katie gets married, Ethan gets the company. - Well, what's the "if"? - There is... nothing. Technically, I could still get married first. What did-- Technically, I could still get married first. Zelda, I have a plan! I... I just-- what-- I just have to get married first! - Oh, here we go. No. - Stop, listen! No, stop! Thank about this. I can just approach it like hiring a new associate. I can make a suitable list of candidates and conduct some interviews, and... and then I hire someone, if it doesn't work out, I terminate employment. Are you saying you're gonna hire someone to marry you? - No! What is wrong-- - Oh, okay. Why can't I find someone just to actually marry me, and sign the company over, and after the appropriate amount of time, we get a divorce. What's the appropriate amount of time for a corporate takeover marriage? Can you just make me a list of the-- the websites, the dating things that kids are using these days? Why don't you just talk to Katie and Ethan? - No, it's just too much drama. - This isn't dramatic? Listen, I'm not mad at Katie, okay, and I don't want things to get ugly with Ethan. This just makes the decision for everyone. I get married first, I get Emerson Foods. Hm... okay. Go, Zelda, go! It's amazing! Go! It's a plan! - Are you sure? - Yes. This isn't working. How can the pool of eligible men be so-- - Completely and totally lame? - Yes. - It's hard to get back in the game. - This isn't a game. Oh, right. I forgot this was a well thought out and perfectly logical plan. Please don't make fun of me. I just need ideas. Okay. Uh... Uh, personal ad? No. I'm picturing skeevy stalker types. Speed dating? Hm? I did it. What? Is there something faster than what I'm doing now? Oh. Social media. Catching up with old pals, cute guys from the past, the one that got away. You have one of those? - No. - Huh? Come on. Everyone's got the one. Oh! Well, there was, um... there was Paul. Ooh! Who's Paul? We were, uh, pretty close in high school. And actually, I always thought that we would eventually end up together. - Okay. This sounds good. Paul. - But I haven't talked to him in years. - Where's Paul now? - Uh, I think he lives here. - My mom keeps up with his mom. - Ding, ding, ding! We have a winner! - Call her. Call her on the phone. - Who? What? Call your mom! Call and see if she still talks to his mom and, like, "Can I get his number?" - Really? - Yeah! - Like, randomly? - Yeah. - What do I say? - Say something about the party. - Okay, hold on. Okay. - Be casual, be like... - Hello? - Hey, Mom. Um, random question. Have you talked to Connie Taylor lately? Taylor, ooh! Yeah, I like it. Yeah! You do? Really? - Yeah? - Let's have it. Can you give me her number? How has it possibly been this long since we've gotten together? Well, your mother stopped paying me to hang out with you after high school. Really? What's in it for you now? Well, free lattes. Thank you, by the way. Ah. Uh-huh. It's lattes or loneliness for me. Well... I guess you're worth it. Okay. So we have both been ridiculously busy. - Ah! Not an excuse. - And we never talk anymore. - Sadly true. - And now in the season of giving and peppermint lattes... Ew! No, no, no. Egg nog lattes. Peppermint is disgusting. In the season of egg nog lattes, you lure me to a semi-private location for what purposes, - I can only imagine. - Hm? I just missed you. I miss you too. But I am not completely without wiles. Um, Katie's getting married. Katie is getting married? That is great. Yes, I know. It's wonderful. - Oh, I sense a little intensity. - More on that later. Good, 'cause I love it when the plot thickens. Okay. First things first. My mom and I are throwing Katie an engagement party and I was wondering if you would go with me, as my date. - A real date? - Yep! Please say yes. I am utterly without alternatives. - How flattering. - No... Will you go with me or not? I would be honored to escort you to the celebration of your sister's betrothal. - Too much? - No, it was-- it was amazing. - For the cheap seats in the back. - You're welcome. - You're right, you're welcome. - I said yes. I said yes. There's two on the thing. - Hi! Oh, this is nice! - Hey, Carrie. Carrie. - Hey. - Hi! Thank you for doing this for us. Stop! You know Mom's the party planner. I know, but still. Carrie, you aren't still angry with Ethan and me, are you? Uh... Katie, you didn't do anything wrong. Good! Because I was so worried. I mean, it just puts such a cloud over everything. Stop it. I really want you to enjoy, okay? None of this is your fault, and I'm... I'm sorry if I've been a little crazy, I just... I think I don't really know Ethan that well. Well, you better get to know him. He is going to be your brother. True. Oh, speaking of... Carrie, I would like to introduce you to my best friend and my best man. Dylan. Dylan, this is the official maid of honor and the much-adored sister of the bride, Carrie. Carrie. Hi. Yeah. - We've... we've met. - You're kidding? - No. - Oh! Well, this is wonderful! How do you guys know each other? We're... we're working on a deal together. - Not quite together. - Okay. We are working on a deal near one another. You should watch out for his guy because he's a tiger in the boardroom. Hm... - He's also a great guy. - Really? - Yeah. Saved my life. - Oh, Ethan! - Yeah. Uh-huh. - You never told me this story. We were taking a road trip, we stopped at a gas station, and I saved him from eating a pimento cheese sandwich. This guy smacked it right out of my hands. - Right out of his hands! - Saved my life. - I am, I'm a lifesaver. - A great guy. Okay, yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't know any of this awesome bro code stuff because he was too busy rejecting my offer and walking out of the room. - It was a bad offer. - It was? - Oh, yeah. - Hey. Okay. Oh, hi! Hi. I'm Paul. I'm Carrie's date. - Remember Paul? - Hey, Paul. Clearly I missed something. Katie, do you wanna catch me up to speed so I can choose a side? I honestly have no idea. Well, nothing a good, stiff drink won't fix. I'm taking orders. It's an open bar, folks, don't be shy. - Carrie? - Hm? Mm! Mm-hm. Uh, vodka soda. Lime. Lime. - Katie? - Oh, I will take more of the Pinot Noir, please. Vodka soda with lime, Pinot. I'm gonna go organic triple IPA. Yeah. Oh, no, I'm good. I'm fine. Thanks. Great. Well, you will get nothing and you'll like it. Cute. Katie, honey, come here. I want Aunt Joanne to meet Ethan. Oh, no, don't go! What... Small world, huh? - Oh, it just keeps getting smaller. - Mm-hm. Yeah. - Nice house. - Yeah. Excuse me. I'm gonna... Only move he's got, walking out of the room. It is going to cost a fortune to ship all of this to Napa. Oh, honey, don't worry. I am going to take care of it. You just need to handle the "thank you" notes. Carrie, sweetie, go write down a serving dish from the Bledsoe family. - Another one? - Yes. So many things! We should have just asked for donations to a charity. - You have to set up house. - Mom, seriously. I do not want this to get out of hand. I just want a simple, elegant, intimate wedding. I don't need all this hullaballoo. Oh, yes. You just hate getting all this attention and all these presents. Mm! We are two adults and I own a restaurant. Honestly, Carrie, what am I gonna do with another serving dish? You are going to write lovely thank you notes, and that is that. Ooh. Now you sound like Grandmother Lucille. I thought we weren't going to talk about that. Okay, fine. No. Never mind. That Dylan fellow today, he was very handsome. Yeah. What was going on between you two? Um, nothing. Nothing! We're kind of working on a deal together. - Let's just say it's intense. - Mm... This isn't going to cause any problems, is it? No, darling sister. You'll still get your - perfect wedding, don't worry. - Okay, let's not start. I will not start if Carrie admits that Dylan is cute. I hate you. - Okay, yes. - Yes, what? - Yes, he's cute. - Ha! I knew it! Yes, but unfortunately, when he talks I want to punch him, so... - Carrie! - Well, then there won't be any hanky-panky - amongst the wedding party. - Mom! Please, don't engage her. It'll only get more graphic. Okay, okay. Oh! What in the world is this? Oh! Aunt Joanne is taking pottery classes. You don't need to send a thank you note for that. I like all that glitter. - Carrie? - Hey. - Hi. - Oh. Um... Hello, Mr. Courtney. Uh, Dylan, please. I think considering the current attire, we can skip the formalities. - Um... - That's a great outfit. Right, yeah, well, we've shut down for the office Christmas party. So... I see. It's, uh... it's very festive. - You... you are very festive. - Yeah. You're kind of coming on the back end. We're about to wrap things up. - They seem to be having a ball. - Yeah. We are a family company. You're fond of saying that. So why are you here? Did you not get my paperwork? I had Zelda send it over this morning. Do the Rowlings have some questions or...? Oh, no, it's not a business visit. I'm actually here on personal business. Uh, sorry, Ethan and I were... we were discussing the bachelor party. Oh, crap. Does-- Oh, I'm supposed to throw Katie a bachelorette party! I'm, like, the worst maid of honor ever. Well, maybe, but I can help you with that, I think. What do you mean? Well, we've got a cabin about an hour north of Ethan's farm, where I grew up, and Ethan and I used to go there when we were kids. He really likes the place. So we were talking, and he said he'd love to have the bachelor and bachelorette party there. - So it would save you planning. - Well, that's... um, nice. Thank you. Sure. And, of course, Paul is more than welcome. - Also very nice. Thank you. - Sure. - Miss Carrie! Miss Carrie! - Oh! - Can we have some candy, please? - Yeah. The most beautiful dresses ever! One for you, one for you. Merry Christmas. So, you know, I'm-- elves don't have pockets, I don't have my phone. Oh, no. I've got your email, and we can take care of it. Yeah, and we'll talk about dates. - Just get in touch. - Great. - I love your... your antlers. - Okay, bye. Okay, I'll... I'm sorry. Oh, you know what? It's, uh... - Here you go. - Oh. Make sure you don't eat it all at once. You'll get a stomachache. Okay, bye. - I am mortified. - What? What was Mr. Courtney doing here? - Uh... - Being handsome? Mom! He wants to talk about wedding stuff. - Hm. - He was oddly nice. I don't know what to do with that information. Well, people can be surprising sometimes. - Hm... Yes, they can. - Say cheese. So, this weekend is the big bachelorette cabin extravaganza? Yes. It's very exciting. You know how much I love the outdoors. Well, but Paul's going, right? Yeah. He's driving up to meet me. This one sounds promising. I really-- I think he might be perfect. I trust him and I feel like I can make him understand all this. There's a whole lot of all this to understand. Yeah. I, uh... invited him to the house tonight. Oh! Well, that sounds cozy. Mm-hm! And between this weekend, and, you know, tonight, if things go the way that I think they will, I'll be able to, you know, give him my proposal, and my "proposal." You are aware of how incredibly, insanely Scooby Doo this all sounds, right? Sorry, did the Scooby crew ever fail to solve a case? That comment was not meant to encourage you. I'm trying to be positive here. Have you even talked to your sister about what you're doing? No. I don't want to stress her out any more. The wedding is totally overwhelming. I think, "Surprise! I'm married! Might stress her out a little more. You know, it's... Katie just wants to have her one, perfect day, and I really want her to have it. But the company means everything to me, so I'm gonna do whatever I have to do to keep it. I just think Katie might be really hurt when she... Don't you have some sort of assistant-y thing to be doing, like getting me coffee or alphabetizing something? Okay. Line drawn in the sand. I'm hereby out of your personal life. No, no, no. I-- I didn't mean it like that. You're right. So, uh, anyway, I made your flight reservations for this weekend. There should be a confirmation email in your inbox. - Zelda. - Yes, Ms. Tate? Oh, come on. Really? Just observing the protocol. Okay. Have a good weekend. Okay, love you too. Are you sad I didn't wanna go out tonight? No, this is great. Are you-- are you cold? - Are you? - Mm. Oh. Here. I love this movie. It isn't Christmas until I watch it. Yeah, it's... it's so romantic, isn't it? I'm so happy you're coming with me this weekend. I can't miss an opportunity to see you in hiking boots. Hm... You know, Christmas movies make me want to snuggle. - Oh... okay. - Oh! That's good. Mm... hm... Hey, are your eyes blue or green? My eyes are brown. Clearly, they don't pay you to be observant over at that national conglomerate. Really? Let me see. - Are you mesmerized? - Totally. Oh. Check this out. I read online the other day that they trucked in 5000 pounds of actual snow for this scene. Hm... neat. Hm... Every time. I come bearing a sister! Oh! Hello, sister! Oh, my goodness! Have you two been in the schnapps already? Gingerbread liqueur! Hi! I'm Abby. Oh. Uh, yeah, we met at Katie's restaurant opening, right? - You're the pastry chef. - Yes. Guilty! - I'm Ashley. - Ashley is an artist. I have several of her mixed media pieces in the restaurant. Oh. I'm surrounded by creative types. None of Ethan's guys are here yet. - Are we expecting any hotties? - Um, I hate that word, but yes, Ethan has invited some very handsome friends. - Yes! - With personalities like sandpaper. Well, I think it's brilliant how you're having the bachelor and bachelorette parties together. Well, Ethan and I aren't into all that last hurrah nonsense. She wouldn't even let me hire a stripper. Oh! There are moments when your being uptight makes me love you a lot. - Hm. Carrie, I'm going to have to ask you - Hm? To try really hard to get along with Dylan this weekend. - That's the best man, right? - Mm-hm. Is it, really? Yeah, I find that laced with so much irony. - Carrie! - Yes! He is the bestest best man ever. - He's amazing! - I'm bored. Let's do a shot. - Okay! - Go. What in the... How are you even friends with these people? You... you'll love them. Morning mimosas! Oh, Abby, I have some thoughts about the cake design. - Oh, what about a Buche de Noel? - Ooh! Wait. Isn't that, like, a giant cake roll log thing? Yes! And I could put little woodland creatures on top. That sounds earthy like Ethan. Maybe for the groom's cake? As long as it has chocolate, I'm set, babe. Oh. It's chocolate. Chocolate-flavored love. Ooh! What if we have a menagerie of woodland creatures representing our families? A buck and doe for my parents? - That does sound very dear. - Oh... Oh, my God, you're marrying Dad. A buck and a doe. Yeah, I think I could manage that. Well, I definitely want it festooned with Christmas foliage like poinsettias, or holly, or mistletoe. - Heads up! - Mistletoe! - Oh! - Ooh! Come on, get in the holiday spirit, dude. - I'm gonna get some coffee. - Aw! You! Well, I am definitely not gonna let this go to waste. Bow-chicka-bow-bow! Oh... okay. Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't know anybody was out here. Oh, no, it's okay. I just can't get a signal anywhere. Well, you probably won't. That's one of the reasons why I love this place. Right. Yeah. I was, um... I'm just trying to check on Paul. Oh, I'm sorry. Do your thing. Oh, um... listen. Thanks for putting all this together. Yeah. Yeah, sure. It's no problem. I mean, I know you're going through a lot with your grandmother's will and everything. Ethan kind of filled me in. - He did? - Mm-hm. He must have had a lot of questions. Naturally, he had a few. It must be nice to have a corporate lawyer as a best bud, right? - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. - Oh, I'm not upset. I'm just really frustrated that I can't get any reception. You'd think a global communications company would find a place to nail a satellite to a pine tree out here or something. - It's ridiculous. - I keep feeling like we're just getting off on the wrong foot. Do you have a landline? Uh... no. No, I don't, but, uh... I can drive you into town. Oh. Um... okay. Thanks. - Okay. Sorry. - It's fine. After you, really. Just pull. Right here. You need to... There you go. I have arrived! Just in time for lunch and debauchery. - Looks like he made it. Hey! - Hey. - Great. - Oh! I was worried! Mm. - Oh, hey. - Hey. - Is everyone back from the hike? - Yeah, I'm just, uh, - I'm just grabbing beers for everybody. - Nice. - Yeah. - Oh, I'm sorry. I've made such a mess in here. - I'll clean it up. - No, I didn't, uh... I didn't know you cooked. Oh, I don't cook. I bake. There's a big difference. - Where's Paul? - Um, I sent him into town to get more sprinkles. Oh. He's a, uh, he's a nice guy. I like him. Yeah. He's an old friend. Oh. Can you-- Do you mind just grabbing that batch? Yeah. Sure. Gotcha. - Oh, man. - Hm? - Oh! - Mm-hm! - These smell incredible. - It's an old family recipe. Mm-hm. Look, I'm, uh... I'm sorry about earlier. - About what? - Well, you know, about Ethan. - I didn't really-- - Oh, no, no! We don't-- please. Let's not talk about it. Here. - Oh! - Mm-hm. - Oh, man. - Mm-hm? - You're giving me flashbacks. - Mm! - The good kind or the bad kind? - These are amazing. We, um, we spent Christmas up here every year - when I was a kid. - Oh, yeah? Why'd you stop? After my grandpa passed away, we just didn't do it as much anymore. - Oh. - You know how it is. - Ow! - Oh! Hold on. - Water, water. - Stupid! It's still hot. Need somebody to help. - I was not... - There you go. - Thanks. - Yeah. - That's better, thank you. - Yeah. Well, they had red and green and yellow, and I got seriously Christmas and I got some of those little silver ball things too. - I sustained an injury. - Yeah. Well, you're back. So you can... you can take over. I'm gonna grab these guys, and I'm gonna grab this. - Oh, yeah! - See you later. What'd you do? I was so stupid. I... Don't touch a hot pan. - Ooh! You weren't kidding. - Yeah. - I can take care of that. - Yeah? Yeah. - Mom, there's so many gifts! - No, I don't care whether she likes it or not. This one is for Aunt Joanne. So tell me, do you think that your father is going to like the fedora I bought him? Um, that depends. Is it 1940 and is he planning to investigate crime? - He's just so hard to buy for. - No, it's cute. So Connie Taylor tells me that you and Paul have been seeing each other. Uh, wow. I had no idea that the, um, country club set had such an extensive intelligence network. Yeah. Well, it does. So how long has this been going on? Uh, you remember, I asked you for Paul's mother's number. - Oh. - No. For Dad? Mom. Aren't they cute? Look, I got two of them for Ethan too. - So is it serious? - I... hope so. Have you and Katie figured out what's gonna happen after the wedding? Mom, what is this, an interrogation? It's... I just don't want you to be surprised if Katie and Ethan decide to assert their ownership. - Um, why, did she say something to you? - No, not at all. But you and your sister have a habit of... not communicating and making assumptions. Remember the prom dress fiasco? - She bought the same dress as me. - See? You didn't communicate. It doesn't-- Look, this is a little bit different. Okay? No. The stakes are just higher. Please talk to your sister. Fine! I will! Isn't this hilarious? - I'm sorry, did you say hideous? - Oh, hush. Ethan's gonna love it. - Terrifying. - Oh, stop. - Terrifying. - Cute! It's very cute. It's cute? It looks like Chucky! You say that like it's a bad thing. You're a crazy woman. I'm done. - You look breathtaking. - Oh, thank you. It's just perfect. I can't imagine a more beautiful dress. - A December bride! - Oh! You know, we don't sell a lot of dresses by this designer. - She is very unique. - Mm... I guarantee you will not see another bride in this dress. - Isn't she beautiful? - Mm-hm. All brides are beautiful! This is going to be challenging in terms of a veil. Do you have feelings about a veil? Maybe flowers. Maid of honor? What do you think about a garland of flowers? - Oh, gardenias! - What about a white silk poinsettia, just right here? Mm... Oh, I'm... I'm sorry. I really, I have no opinion on this. Darlene, didn't we just get in one of those beaded silk turbans? - Turban? - Oh, that would be intriguing. Help me get it from the stockroom and we'll see what else is back there. - Wow! - Do you like it? Mm! Oh, hon! - Come here. You're so cute. - No. Hold on. Let's see... Hm. Come here, you. - Hm? - Don't look. Come here. - Mm-hm. - It's okay. I'll be gentle. Look! - Oh! It's pretty. Hm... - See? I can play. You know, Ethan said that Dylan has been asking about you. Really? What was he asking about? I don't know. But Dylan is very handsome - and successful and tall. - With occasional bouts of obnoxiousness. - Carrie, he's nice. - Yeah, he was... he was nice at the cabin. Wow. You are so stubborn about people. You know what? Let's look at some veils. Huh? - Carrie... - Hm? I want to talk about the company. Is Mom bugging you too about communicating? - Let's just... - No, but since Ethan and I are going to own the company after the wedding... Did Ethan ask you to talk to me? Well, there isn't any reason he shouldn't show an interest. Right. Yeah, sweet Dylan said he was asking some questions. Ethan thinks that we could start an organic food distribution division. You're already making plans? Well, we just started to realize that if we are going to put our names on something... Ethan's name won't be on it, Katie. It's Emerson Foods. I understand that, but whether you like it or not, we are going to be owners. Katie, you have never in your entire life expressed any interest in the company. Carrie, don't be mad. Okay? We were just talking to Dylan about the transfer and then all these ideas-- Wait. You're talking to Dylan about the company that I've been building, the company that I have every right to, Katie, and you expect me not to be mad right now? Carrie, you're acting like a spoiled child about this whole thing. Oh, my-- You are so self-righteous, Katie. - Seriously. - Oh... And you know what? You're not married yet. Okay? When and if you and Ethan make it to the altar in your Stevie Nicks lace-explosion, when that happens, please, you two can waltz into the lobby of Emerson Foods and declare yourself the king and queen of organic canned bunnies. Okay? But until that happens, I'm gonna continue on the path that I've been on for the last seven years, Katie, while you've been off cooking fiddle ferns for snotty food jerks. You said you liked my dress. God, it's not about the dress, Katie! No! It is about you being selfish and stubborn and single-minded! You know what? I wouldn't make any plans if I were you. It's amazing how quickly things can change. What are you talking about? Carrie, what are you talking about?! Hello, this is Zelda. Beep! Just kidding, here it is. Yeah, Zelda, hey, it's me. Can you do me a favor and make me a reservation for two at 8 p.m. tonight at Wilde? And I also need you to have the company jet ready at 10:30 to take me to Vegas. Um, also I need you to book a room at the Bellagio, the penthouse if they have it, and just make sure that you pack me a suitcase of a few things, have it ready and waiting on the plane. And pack the white suit. And Zelda, do not call me and ask me a million questions about why. ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a happy New Year ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ This is so fun. - Yeah. - Yeah. - It's a great restaurant. - Yeah. Oh, my parents know the owners. And we're actually having Katie's rehearsal dinner here. - Oh. Okay. - But no, I... I meant this, us, it's... it's fun. - It is. - Yeah. I'm not good at subtle, am I? No, you aren't, but sometimes it's very entertaining to watch you try. I'm not the most romantic person in the world, Paul. Practical has its place. You make me sound like Katie. - That's not a bad thing, is it? - No! - Are you okay? - Mm-hm... Um... okay. - Paulie... - Hm? So... I have a jet waiting to take us to Vegas, and I booked a suite at the Bellagio. - Carrie... - And I... Will you marry me? Tonight? I know it sounds crazy. But I... we would shock everyone! - I can't. - Paul, I know that you're not madly in love with me - or anything, but it's okay. - Carrie. Carrie. I'm gay. - Come on! - Ta-da! What are you talking about? That's not funny. - Hm? - Mm. - You're serious? - I am. Oh, my gosh! Hm... wow. This was the worst plan ever. I'm sorry. Mm! You know what? I don't even care. - Well, I kind of do. - Listen. You know that I need this to get around the will, or else Katie and Ethan are gonna take everything from me. No, that-- that doesn't sound like Katie. Look, it's simple. We just, we'd get married, you sign over the company to me, and we can go our separate ways. Carrie... Please, please, Paul, please, can you just think about it? Carrie, listen. I love you. Great. Then do this for me. This one thing. Please? I do want to get married someday, but... but for real and... to a guy. Right. Okay. Then she wins. Cheers. You make it sound like it's a football game. Was that a sports reference from the gay guy? It's kind of ironic, don't you think? You know, uh, I don't think I want dessert after all. - Oh, Paul. - Can I call you a cab? Hm... No, I'm fine. Good night, Carrie. Okay, we have one German chocolate cake-- Oh, lovely! Thanks. Um... You know what? Can you just take those to the bar? I'm gonna have them both. You know what? - Hello? Hello? - Oh, yeah, hi. It's... it's me. - Carrie, is that you? - Um, who do you think you are cahooting with my sister and the financy... her fee... sinini? - Okay. - Mm-hm, it's me. Um... - Try that one more time. - Her feenan... her fyance. The boy, that boy. Hm? - Carrie, are you okay? - Mm... I thought you were being nice, and you were just being a spy. - Do you know that? You're a spy. - Wait. It's... - Uh-huh. So rude. - Okay, Carrie, just calm down. Calm down. Where-- Tell me where you are. - Don't change the subject. - It's okay, just tell me where-- Where are you? I'm, um... I'm at the-- I'm at the, um... I'm at the place with the guy, with the... - Just can you-- I can't. - Carrie? Hello? - Just hang up. - I'm Todd. - I think I have Carrie's phone? - Oh. Hi, Todd. - Do not be nice to him. - Where are you? We're at the bar at Wilde. Right. Bar at Wilde. Okay, great. Thanks. Can you give the phone back to Carrie, please? - Sure. - I don't wanna... please. - Hm? - You there? Carrie? - What? - Look, I'm gonna leave right now. Okay? I'll be there in about 30 minutes. - Don't go anywhere. - Okay, Mr. Bossy. - So lovely. - I... Can I have another one of those, please? You're very nice. I promise I'll leave soon. Hi. - Carrie? - Hm! - Hm? Mm... - Carrie? Hi. - Hi! - Hi. - You found me! - I did. - Hi! - Hi. Okay. Come here. - Hm? Shush! - Hm? Okay. Don't make it weird by being all question-y. I'm here. - Okay. Let's go home. - God! Right. - Let's do that. Oh! - Are you okay? - I'm good. Sorry. - All right. Here you go. - Let's do this. One on top. - Yeah. - Whoa! - You know, I used to hate you. Well, I'm glad your opinion has changed. Mm-hm. You were like, "I'm Dylan Courtney. And then Rowling Vineyards is all about people who care and you're just a big, corporate, mean fish." I don't quite think I said it like that. - Yeah. Where's my phone? - I... - Sir? I have to call my Zelda. - Let's go. - Okay. - Time to go. Whoa! - Okay. Sh! Come here. - Hey! What? - Come here. Come here. - Uh... okay. I wanna tell you something. Come here, come close. - Okay. - I actually expect you-- respect you professionally, - despite the disagreements. - Okay. Mm-hm. And you look really pretty in plaid. - Thank you. - It's nice on you. - I think you're a little drunk. - No! - No, a little bit. Let's go. - Okay. All right. - Okay. - We should... We should get married. Would you marry me? We could thwart her evil plan. I do, I have the jet and the suit and it's white and it's beautiful and it's bride-y... - Okay. - Where's my phone? I need to call Zelda. - A jet and-- - Sir, did you take my phone? Come on, let's... we'll go get on the bride-y, white plane. - Yes. I'm good. Good night, sir. - Good night. - Put you in your white suit... - Wait, gotta go. - There you go. We can go. - Did you say goodbye? - There we go. Good night. - The bouncer lady. Thank you. - Whoa! - I'm fine. - You're good. - I'm good. - We're in my house! - Yes, we are. How did we get here? Did we get here by magic? - Did we get here by Santa? - No. We got here by my car. Oh! Vroom, vroom! You're a lot more animated with four martinis in you. I'm like some kind of party animal! Oh, boy. Pajamas. Where are your pajamas? - Over there. Right-- mm-hm. - This-- - Alrighty. - Ow! Yes. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - You have to unzip me. - Okay. Back there. It's right there. Oh, it's over there. - It's on the side. - It's on the side. I told you where it was. There you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'm just gonna... - Hm? - Okay. Oh, my gosh! It's like they're alive! - You okay? - Mm-hm. - I got it. I'm good. - You need help? I don't need any help. I'm good. Does this mean you need help? Do you like my slip? Slippy-slippy... My grandma always said to wear proper undergarments. She was a smart lady. Arms. One at a time. There you go. Okay. You're very nice when you're not being a butthead. Thanks... I think. - Can I do something to you? - What do you wanna do? Mm... I was thinking that... Okay. Come here. Come on. Uh! Good night, Carrie. I need you to return this. And I need to die. Cheese and crackers! What happened to you? Please, inside voices. Okay? I can't return the suit, you had it altered. Thank you. Zelda, please tell me you have some miracle cure in your desk that'll help me forget that I have a head. - I have a breath mint. - No. Have you seen my phone? - I take it you're not a missus? - No. If I didn't feel so miserable, I might have time to be super embarrassed. - Oh... he said no? - No, he said gay. - And you didn't know this? - No, I didn't know this. What are you gonna do? There's not enough time to find anyone else unless I'm willing to make truly desperate choices, so... And you don't consider your last plan a little desperate? - Well... - Sorry. Katie and Ethan are gonna take over, and it's all for nothing. Everything I did. Carrie, have you considered even for a second, you don't own the company now? It doesn't have to change anything. You're right. It doesn't have to change anything. That's the point. Nothing ever changes, Zelda. I just-- I-- I thought that one day, I would own all this, and I won't have to answer to anyone else. - Your sister's not gonna-- - I'm just gonna go to work. Hey, hi. I have Dylan Courtney here to see you. - Says he has your phone. - What? Has to give it to you in person. He's here. - Oh. Hi. Hm... - Hi. - Thank you. - Welcome. I do indeed have your phone. Thank you for bringing it back. Yeah, sure. I figured, you know, you'd be lost without it, so... there you go. Where did you find it? You don't remember? - You don't remember. - I'm confused. Do you remember anything about last night? - I'm confused. - I brought you home. - I took a cab. - No, I brought you home. - I woke up in my pajamas. - You did. That was, uh... That was entertaining. - Excuse me? - No, I mean, I-- Look, I was just trying to help you. - By getting me undressed? - No, you got yourself undre-- Okay, hold on. Look, you got yourself undressed. Okay? Look, you called me, you were drunk, you were at the bar, I came, I picked you up before you made a total idiot out of yourself. You don't remember this? Oh, don't act so superior. Okay? I don't even know you. I'm not-- Okay, look, I just wanted to help you out by bringing your phone back. I figured you need it, and that was all. - Okay. Thanks. - Wow. Okay. Uh... You know, you're a lot nicer when you're drunk. You're a lot nicer when your lips aren't moving. You're welcome. All right, here I come. Okay. It's all right. Okay. I got two kinds of tissues: the box and the rectangle. You choose. Why didn't you try to stop me? I'm pretty sure I tried to stop you real hard, several times. My sister hates me, Dylan hates me, I'm not gonna get the company, - Paul probably hates me. - Your sister doesn't hate you. I've been so awful to her, Zelda. How am... How am I supposed to go to that rehearsal dinner? Maybe with a little less snot? Zelda, please, please don't tell my dad about the whole Vegas wedding thing. He would be so disappointed, please. My lips are sealed. Do you know that I drunk-dialed Dylan last night and asked him to take me home? He put me in my pajamas. I may or may not have overheard that part of your conversation. They weren't even cute pajamas! Carrie, breathe. This isn't fair. I've been working so hard-- In through your nose. Okay. Get it together. Get it together. I need to get it together. - Okay. Get it together. - You got it. I... Oh, my God! - I can't get it together. - Okay. I can't get it together! I can't breathe! - Here I come. - My heart hurts! It's okay, it's okay. Carrie, Carrie. Carrie, look at me. Look at me. Look at me, right here. Okay? - Yeah? - Carrie Tate does not - back down from a challenge. Okay? - Okay. Carrie Tate is in control and always on top. - Okay. - Okay? She's a problem solver. Right? You're gonna get yourself up, you're gonna get to that rehearsal dinner. Okay? ♪ I go wandering after dark ♪ ♪ Missing my old counterpart ♪ ♪ The carols that I'm singing Miss the thrill that you were bringing ♪ ♪ When the two of us walk through the snow ♪ ♪ I miss those days like a mistletoe ♪ ♪ It's hard to be merry when you feel so low ♪ Oh, my God! That was so awkward! What was going on with you and Katie at the wedding rehearsal? - Are you guys in a fight? - Sh! I don't really feel like talking about this right now. Um, well, I feel like you owe us an explanation. Um, why exactly would I owe you that? - Because we're Team Wedding! - Team Wedding! I... I'm not following your logic. I am also sensing some sexual tension between you and the best man. Which is obviously scandalous, considering you have a boyfriend, but I'm gonna fully encourage it anyway. - Had a boyfriend. - Aw! Yeah, I'm not surprised. I think he might be gay. - Oh, totally gay. - Yeah. - Really? I... - Mm-hm. Why-- Okay. I'm not quite sure why I'm talking to you two about this. - I'm just gonna... - Did you really tell Katie her dress makes her look - like Stevie Nicks? - Okay. Um, Stevie Nicks is a very well respected recording artist and style icon. - That was really mean. - That's meaner than when Katie told me my croissants tasted like mushrooms and confusion. Yeah, you're right. I'll apologize. - Oh, my God! - What? Okay, so Dylan is right behind you. - I-- okay-- - Unbridle your sexual tension and go! - You, go! - Oh! - I'm so... - I'm sorry. - I tripped. No, no, it's... - No, it's... no worries. You look lovely. Oh. Thank you. So do you. Thank you. Uh... Look, I want to apologize if you feel like I crossed some sort of line last night. - I didn't-- - No, it's, um... You were trying to help. Yeah, I was. I was trying to help. I know. Uh, would you like to go sit down? Uh, I'll be there in a minute. Okay. I'll see you in a minute. - Carrie, darling. - Yes? They're serving the salads. Come sit down. Okay. I actually have a couple of things to say. Um, no it's not the Tijuana trip. I'll save that for tomorrow for that speech. Um, Ethan, Katie, I just wanted to tell you how much I admire your bravery. And I know that it takes a lot of bravery to open yourself up, and to let your guard down, and to promise forever. And the fact you two love each other so completely that you are willing to walk down that road together... That's amazing. And I gotta tell you, I'm actually a little envious of, uh, of that kind of love. But... most of all, it makes me happy. It makes me happy to think that it exists, and it makes me happy that I'm going to experience it in your orbit. And it makes me happy to think that maybe one day, if I'm lucky enough, a little bit of that will rub off on me. Anyway, cheers to both of you. - I love you. - Cheers. - Cheers, buddy. - Cheers. Cheers. Sorry. Just... can I talk to you for one second? I am so, so sorry. I have been an idiot this whole time. I do not want to fight. Okay, what is going on? You-- you have no idea what a mess of everything I made. No, Carrie, it is a beautiful night and tomorrow will only be more perfect. No, no, Katie, you don't understand. - I am trying. - Katie... I asked Paul to marry me. But Paul is gay. Am I the only person in the world that didn't know that? Well, I don't understand. I thought you two were just friends. Yeah. I was... I thought that if I got married first, I wouldn't lose Emerson Foods. - What are you talking about? - I literally thought that if I could get Paul to marry me... I could keep you and Ethan from getting the company. Oh, that's so pathetic. - Thanks so much. - Oh... Even you have to admit that is high on the pathetic scale. And I have been so awful to Dylan. Yeah, Ethan told me about that. Did he tell you everything? He said you told Dylan he looked sexy in plaid. - I said what?! See? I... - Okay. I don't think we can allow you talk to anyone you are not related to. And I think I actually like him. I think... I think I sexy-plaid-like him. Carrie, you're one of those people that is so smart... - and you're stupid. - Thanks a lot. Okay. Look, Carrie, this isn't worth it. Okay? - Ethan and I will step away completely. - No, no, no! That's... see, that's... not what I want. Then why are you doing this? Okay, what is it that you want? - I don't know. - Oh, Carrie, look. I love you. And I know that this is a lot for you, but I cannot spend my rehearsal dinner in a hallway next to the restroom. Are you coming? - Yes, yes, in a minute. - Okay. - Hello? - Hi, it's Carrie. No, everything's fine. Um, do you have a minute? Wow, Katie. - You look amazing. - Just call me Stevie. No, no... That was-- that was Scrooge Carrie, okay? I'm... Now I'm Tiny Tim. God bless us, everyone! I feel like I am gonna throw up. Why am I so nervous? - Why? Because this is huge, honey. - Mm-hm. Carrie, if I faint, will you create a diversion? You... you're not gonna faint. But yes, you can count on me. Here. Look, I'll distract you. I have something for you. What is this? This is a letter of resignation. Yep. Um, it has nothing to do with you and Ethan. Here. It has a little to do with you and Ethan. Oh, Carrie, Ethan feels awful that for even a second, you would think he would want to hurt you. No. He shouldn't. I haven't even given the guy a chance. He just got so excited about the possibilities. He has some really great ideas, Katie. Carrie, truly we both think that the company should go to you. And that means so much to me, but it doesn't change my decision. - Okay? - I don't understand. I thought Emerson Foods was everything to you. I'm ready for my own adventures. I don't know what to say. Well, um, say that you accept my resignation, and you're prepared to offer me a very lucrative exit package. Of course. - I love you. - I love you! This is a big day! What are-- Stop! Let's get you perfect, Stevie. - Oh... Mm-mm! - Don't! Don't! - Don't touch your face! - Okay. Is this too much? - No. It's beautiful. - Thanks. Oh, Mark! Look at our girls. Are you guys ready? To be honest, I've been dreading this since the day you were born. - Dad! - Dad! It's not easy giving away your baby. - You're gonna make me cry! - I love you, Daddy. - I love you too. - This is so precious! Okay. Okay, we all need to come together, take a cleansing breath. - Oh, my! - Seriously? Come on, it's her day. I love you all so much. I couldn't ask for a more glorious day, - or a more perfect family. - Oh, Katie. Dad, seriously, I love them both, but you have to make them stop. Ladies, we have a wedding to get to, right? Okay, all right, so just, I got the hair, got the makeup. - I just... - Yes, go. - Come on. - Get it together, woman. Oh, my goodness! All right, lady. Here we go. Time to start the rest of my life. Ah! Yeah. I know what you mean. - Okay. I'll see you out there. - Okay. Bridesmaids are supposed to be hideous. You are not playing by the rules, my dear. I have a reputation for being difficult. But all the same, I couldn't leave you without a date to the ball. Paul, I'm so sorry. I wasn't good to you-- Nope. Not another word. I don't accept apologies at weddings. - I dance. - No. - Oh, yes. - Oh, no! - Oh, yes. - Okay. - Oh, right now? Come on! - Come. Yeah, look at that. Oh... - May I cut in? - Yeah.
