[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [ENGINE SHUTS OFF] FRANK: People never think about the cruelty of the Bible, the violence. We teach children with hand puppets and coloring books some of the bloodiest stories and then tell them that it all means we should love each other. That's what some would call a paradox. What does anyone who's known that kind of violence understand about love? When Samson tied 300 foxes together and lit them on fire. Killed a thousand men with a donkey jawbone. A thousand. Pushed a temple over after his eyes were put out. 'Course Samson was the lucky one. In the end, he didn't have to see the monster he became. [TRUCK BEEPING] A man can only see so much darkness before he goes blind. [TRUCK DOOR OPENS] [TRUCK DOOR CLOSES] [BUZZER] [DOOR WHIRRING] [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [RADIO CHATTER] [DOOR CLOSES] SLOAN: [LAUGHS] Charlie boy! Who's this? - Oh, that's Bruce. - Bruce? You know, they say food tastes different on the outside, Bruce. What you say? Shit, I don't know. I try not to eat prison food on the outside. Let's get the fuck out of here. BRAD: Hey, Tara. TARA: Brad. What are you... a produce manager now? I'm a whatever-needs-to-get- done-around-here manager. Fruit ain't gonna stock itself. Oh, I hear that. So, did you hear about Morgan's baby? We got a call she wanted to deliver at home. Kid started coming out, but it was breeched. We tried to turn it around. Yeah, she pushed it through, though, but the head got caught up, squished like an avocado. Baby's fine now, but it's got a... [CLICKING TONGUE] big ol' dent. Kinda looks like the baby's got a little ashtray on its forehead. - Brad, just... - Well, what? You know Morgan. I thought you'd want to... Oh! TARA: [LAUGHS] You sure you don't want a bigger one of those? It's for Engels here. Keeps parking the patrol car behind Sammy's to catnap. I told you... I'm not napping. I'm meditating. Anyway, I was telling your daughter about Morgan's kid and how it looks like she's got a little baby ashtray - on her face. - That's great. - BRAD: Baby ashtray face. - Perfect, Brad. Right? What? Listen. Um... ...your mother's cooking dinner this Thursday. Be... Be nice to see you there. Yeah. Well, he's always welcome at the house. You know that. Yeah, I know. FRANK: Honey, I just want you to be happy. We're fine. Okay. Hey. [SMOOCHES] Bye, Dad. So, uh... how about one for the deputy? No? Okay. Bye, Officers. [ENGINE SHUTS OFF] - You're home late. - [DOOR CLOSES] NICK: Yeah. Got caught up at Flynn's. Sal needed a lift again. Marlene read him the riot act when you dropped him off? I did not stick around to hear that. TARA: [CHUCKLES] [CAP CLINKS] Pork chops were half price, so I bought extra. Don't fill up on beer. What did you say? - Nick. - [GRUNTS] Mm. Come on. I got dinner to make. NICK: Mm. [SMOOCHES] The pork chops are gonna be cold. Oh, yeah? [PAN CLATTERS] I love cold pork chops. Mm. TARA: [MOANS SOFTLY] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] [KEYS JINGLING] [VEHICLE DOOR CLOSES] You guys are pretty close with this Nick fella, huh? Were. - Ah. - [LIGHTER CLICKS] Three of us... ...we were gonna go down to Mexico. Buy us an orange grove. Sit around, drinking tequila. Fucking se√±oritas while the greasers picked them for us. - You know, Bruce... - BRUCE: Huh? ...if things work out... ...you might be able to come with. Yeah. That'd be, uh... That'd be real special. CHARLIE: [CHUCKLES] BRUCE: You know, not that it matters... I mean, the job's a job... ...but, um... ...what happened? CHARLIE: Well, you know what they say about plans. BRUCE: Yeah. Shit happens. [KNOCKING] Forchet? [CHUCKLES] Good to put a face to the voice. You get it? About that. Yeah, the man you're looking for, he isn't the easiest fella to find. You get my address? More or less. I got an address. But, uh... thing is, with travel expenses, 2 grand's just not gonna cut it. We had a deal. FORCHET: That was the deal. I'm gonna need another 2 grand. SLOAN: Another 2 grand? Hmm. FORCHET: See, a man in prison pays you to find another man... ...4 grand just feels right. I think I'm well within my bounds to renegotiate. I don't got it. Well... you look like a resourceful man. I'll wait. That's $2,000. You take it. You give me that address. Well, I'll tell you what. I'm-a cut you a deal, alright? Aaaahhh! [GROANS] Motherfucker! We made a deal. FORCHET: Fuck! [GROANS] SLOAN: Give me the address. Give me it. [DRAWER OPENS] Here. Let go. Ow. Aah, aah! [GROANING] Shit. [BREATHES SHARPLY, GROANS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GROANING] BRUCE: Where to? Head toward 61. [ENGINE STARTS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] SAL: Fucking Marlene, man. What's that? Tuna. That's what that is. - NICK: [CHUCKLES] Yeah? - Yeah, every damn day, man. I ask for something different, what does she give me? Tuna. It's like she's fucking with me, man. Like, Mexican tuna, Japanese tuna... American tuna. I don't know, man. - JUNIOR: Hey, Sal! - Yeah? I got a shift open this weekend. Are you interested? No, man. Can't do it. Working on Jordan's cabin again. - We got rained out. - Right, right, yeah. Building Noah's ark, right? Mm-hmm. Enjoy that hunting trip. Oh, no. No, that's just work. I swear. Alright. Don't be coming next week begging for a shift 'cause you got rained out. You understand me? Yeah, boss. You can take that shift if you want, man. I can work on the cabin myself. Make it 50/50. No, man. Five days a week in this place is enough for me. - Besides, I want to go hunting. - [BOTH CHUCKLE] SAL: Hey, man, that reminds me. - John asked if he could come. - What'd you tell him? SAL: No, I told him to fuck off, man. There's not enough room in the truck. - Seriously? - Yeah. If we go hunting, I don't want to deal with him. Did you tell him about your gun? - No. - Why not? I owe him money, man. [DOWN-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS] BRAD: Frank, do you copy? FRANK: Go ahead, Brad. BRAD: Hey, I'm taking off. Garrett's on, so I'll see you tomorrow. Copy that. See you tomorrow. [VEHICLE DOOR OPENS] [ENGINE STARTS, VEHICLE DOOR CLOSES] [WATER RUNNING] [RUNNING STOPS] [SIGHS] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] You make sure Sal pays you back some when you get paid for this job. I will. What? You. Sometimes I think your mind's a million miles away. NICK: You sure you're gonna be alright, me being gone all weekend? Yeah, I'll be fine. I promise. Marlene might come over later, maybe watch a movie... if she gets someone to watch the kids. You got, um... Jordan's number, right? - If you need to get in touch? - I've got it taken care of. I will be fine. Go. Have fun. Something for the way up. Thanks, baby. You got enough food? NICK: Just what's in the cooler. Well, if you get some time, bring them back full. NICK: Alright. I better go get Sal before Marlene locks him in the house. Alright, love you. NICK: You too. [SMOOCHES] [ENGINE STARTS] [VEHICLE APPROACHING] [ENGINE SHUTS OFF, HORN HONKS] MARLENE: You be back here by Sunday, - or I won't be. - SAL: Yep. Yeah, yeah. MARLENE: Make sure you pay attention when you're working. You can't fix chairs if you're missing a finger. I know. I'm gonna try not to poke an eye out either. Hey, you look at me. You're gonna be super-cool to your mom, right? That's right. You help her out, whatever she needs. And you. You're just... You're perfect. - Yeah, you're alright. - Mm. - Feed her this time. - [CHUCKLES] Yeah, I'll make sure to do that. Okay. Alright, bye! Love you! See you Sunday! MARLENE: Make sure he stays out of trouble, Nick. - Will do. - MARLENE: Bye. Oh, let's get the fuck out of here. [CHUCKLES] I don't know how you guys do it, man. SAL: Hard liquor. - [CHUCKLES] - [ENGINE STARTS] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYS] JORDAN: Unh-unh. - We don't serve your kind here. - NICK: Oh, yeah? What's that? - Smart, handsome men? - JORDAN: [LAUGHS] You got the "men" part right. - NICK: How's it going, buddy? - How's my cabin coming? I don't know. I guess we'll see it when we get up there. How's it hanging, Sal? South. As always, man. Just don't get up like it used to. Yeah, I hear you. What are you ladies drinking? Oh, anything cold. JORDAN: On the house. Hear, hear. Appreciate it. How Tara doing? Yeah, she's... she's doing alright. Keeping busy. - How you doing? - I'm alright. You still got a phone back there? JORDAN: Yeah, come on back. Tell Tara I said "hello." NICK: Will do. [DIALING] [RINGING] [ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS] Uh, hey, babe. It's me. We just, uh... just got to Jordan's. We're about to head out to the cabin in a little bit. Not sure where you are. I... - Nick. - NICK: Tara? Hey, sorry. I was in the shower. I heard the machine cut on. NICK: It's alright. Yeah, we just made it out here a little bit ago. Just sitting at Jordan's having a couple. TARA: Oh. Having a couple. [SIGHS] You be careful in the dark. Especially on those roads. I will. You eat dinner yet? Yeah. Finished the quiche. NICK: Oh, um... Jordan says "hi." That's sweet. You tell him I said "hi" back. - NICK: Yeah, I will. - [TIMER BUZZES] What was that? Oh, I'm making a pie. Okay. In case Marlene comes by. - [KNOCK ON DOOR] - Speak of the devil. I gotta go. Alright. - I love you. - Yeah, I love you, too. - [KNOCK ON DOOR] - I'm coming! Hold on a goddamn moment, Marlene. Hey, man, she left you yet? NICK: [CHUCKLES] You tell her I said "hello"? NICK: Yep. She said "hi" back. You tell her I said "hi"? Hell no. JORDAN: [LAUGHS] [GUNSHOT] [GUN RELOADS] [LAUGHS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] [EXHALES SLOWLY] [GUNSHOT] - What? - [SCOFFS LIGHTLY] Hey, man, you'd think I wouldn't have to ask. You'd just tell me. This shit, man? That's a big motherfucker, man. Looks like it hurt. - [SIGHS] - Big-ass scar. Fell down. [LAUGHING] Fuck you, man. Yeah. Hey, I'm serious, though, man. I was just hanging out with the wrong guys for a while. We were sort of like a... I don't know what you call it. Didn't add up to anything good, that's for sure. The fuck kind of answer is that, man? My dad and Jordan went back quite a ways, and he's the one that introduced me to Junior. I figured it was better to, you know... start new somewhere where I knew a couple people. Then I met Tara. That was it. That sealed the deal. You married right with that one, man. I mean, at least your father-in-law can get you out of tickets. Mine just kicks me in the teeth. Yeah, well, we got something in common on that one. - Want one? - Yeah. I got one, too, you know? NICK: What's that? Check that out. See that right there? Oh, shit. Where'd you pick that up? - Marlene. - Marlene? Actually, that was her ex-husband. I mean, technically, it was her husband at the time. Wait. So you broke up a marriage? SAL: No, no, no. Wait a minute. Wasn't like that, man. She had one foot out of the door already. When she came in the upholstery store, asked to have her recliner done, she was just radiating that energy she has, man. I was done, man. Took one look at her. That was it. Of course, now that I think about it, getting her pregnant before she was divorced probably sped some things up a little bit, but... He didn't take too kindly to that, and he came in and hit me in the head with a tire iron one day. Yeah, yeah. I was out for 20 minutes. Woke up. About 15 stitches and... - NICK: No shit. - I don't really remember much, but it's kinda fucked up, if you ask me. [CHUCKLES] Marlene and I got married a few weeks later. [SIGHS] And she's been around ever since. What happened to the husband? SAL: He went inside for about four months. Got married in prison, actually. So I don't feel too bad. Hey, man. Here's to finding the one that'll fuck you rotten and then cook you breakfast afterwards. She fucks you rotten, huh? No, not really, man, but one out of two ain't bad. [LAUGHS] Yeah. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] [LOCK ENGAGES] [VEHICLE DOOR CLOSES] [ENGINE SHUTS OFF] [VEHICLE DOOR OPENS] Afternoon. How's it coming? We're gonna need another weekend at it, but it's coming along. - What you got there? - Popped a couple doves. I thought you might want to smoke some. [LAUGHING] Oh, man. Speaking to my soul now. Hey, can I use your phone again? JORDAN: Yeah, of course. Come on. [DIALING] [LINE RINGING] [RINGING] [RINGING CONTINUES] [DIALING] [LINE RINGING] - [RINGING] - GIRL: I want marshmallows! MARLENE: No more marshmallows for you. - It's too much sugar. - GIRL: Just one? No, ma'am. You are not... [ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS] MARLENE: Hi. You've reached the Porters. We're not home right now. So if you could please leave a message, we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Okay? SAL: Hey, Nick. Come on, man. Damn. Marlene's gonna whup my ass if I'm late. Come on, man. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah, let's hit the road. SAL: Yeah. I just called your place. Nobody answered. No? Nobody? Well, she usually gives them a bath right about now. Who knows? Maybe she's drowning them. Might have finally cracked. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] [VEHICLE APPROACHING] Alright, man. Tomorrow morning. NICK: Yup. [DOOR OPENS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] [ENGINE SHUTS OFF] [CREAKING] - Aah! - Whoa, whoa! - BRUCE: [GROANS] Damn it! - Put it down, Nick. - BRUCE: Fuck! - Put it down. He shot me! - Fuck. - He did. [GROANING] Put it down. Put it down. Nick. BRUCE: Fuck! Aah! She drew on us first, Nick. It's the truth. Just take a load off, son. [BRUCE GROANING] [BREATHING SHAKILY] That's for breaking my heart. And Charlie's. Ah, but that's in the past now. It's... It is so good to see you, Nick. I got a question for you, though. You got any ice cream? Hmm? I mean, initially, when we came in, the little lady, the missus was making a pie, and we got it back in the fridge. I mean, doesn't that sound normal? [LAUGHS] Pie and ice cream? - Yep. - SLOAN: [CHUCKLES] You wouldn't happen to have any butter pecan, would you? Nick? Go see if he's got any ice cream. Seriously? I'm fucking bleeding out here. I gotta get this looked at. [SIGHS] What'd you think you were gonna do? You were gonna put on a mask and make believe you were normal? Hmm? It wasn't gonna catch up to you? - NICK: [GASPS LIGHTLY] - You killed her the minute you put that ring on her little finger. [SIGHS] It's kind of ironic, isn't it, Charlie? That's what I'd call it, yeah. Nicholas... ...we're the only family you got. We're the only ones who will ever understand you for what you are. We were a fucking family. And you tried to kill us. BRUCE: It's actually pretty funny. They actually have butter pecan. Hey, hey, Bruce... shut up. [CHUCKLES] When we first showed up, man, we were here for, what, two days? We were here, talking. Talking about... about the weather and all kinds of shit with the little lady, with Tara. Tara is her name, right? Was her name. Man, you should've seen her. She wouldn't shut the fuck up, man. She was asking us all kinds of questions. Real inquisitive. And then she told us about the money. Imagine that. She told us that you said that you, uh... you inherited the money. Who the fuck is leaving you any money? Who does that to their wife? Who lies to their wife like that? What kind of man does that, Nick? Did you use our money to buy this place, Nick? Because that's what she told us. Shit. SLOAN: Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter anymore. You should've just fucking come to us. [SCREAMS] [GUNSHOT] Hey! God damn it, Bruce! Fucking lunged at him! He lunged at you. SLOAN: Nick. Oh, fuck. [SIGHS] Nick. - Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick. - [GROANS] Now, boy... ...I guess this is what you'd call closure. NICK: [SOBBING] [COUGHING] Nick, I'm sorry. - [COCKS GUN] - [SIGHS] [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [SNIFFLES, SIGHS] [GRUNTS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] - [GROANS] - [ENGINE STARTS] [CLATTERING] [GRUNTING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] Bastard.

[METAL CLANGING] [GROANING] FRANK: Don't struggle. NICK: [SIGHS] Hm. How long have I been here? I always knew you were trouble, Nick. I shouldn't have left. FRANK: I told you to stay away from my daughter. But you didn't. Told her not to marry you, but she did. Said I didn't know you like she did. But I knew exactly what you were, didn't I? [BREATHES DEEPLY] FRANK: Now I'm sitting here... ...wondering... ...why I shouldn't take my gun and just... Who do you think did this? Don't push me, Nick. - [METAL CLANGING] - [GRUNTS] You gotta let me go. You think I would do something like this? I know you were hunting with Sal. The coroner told me that... ...that she'd been dead for two days. I know you didn't pull the trigger. But you know who did. Don't you? Yeah. And I'll handle it if you let me go. FRANK: Well, that's not the way we do things around here, son. [STRAINING] [SIGHS] Where you going? I can't be here right now. But you let me know the second he wakes up. - Sure. Why would... - Brad. I'll be back in a few. But for now, you just watch him like a fucking hawk. [SIGHS] [DOWN-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS] [SIGHS] [ENGINE SHUTS OFF] [LOCK DISENGAGES] NICK: [COUGHING] Well, look at that. - He's awake. - [GROANS] How's your chest? Hurts, don't it? [SOFTLY] Would you mind? What? Drink. Thirsty. [SCOFFS] [SIGHS] - [COUGHING] - BRAD: Oh, okay. Oh, alright. [COUGHING CONTINUES] Ugh! - Hey, you okay? - [COUGHING] - BRAD: Hey, you alright? - [GAGGING] BRAD: Nick?

In the hospital? No, man. I went there, and... cop says you weren't there, man. You alright? Yeah. SAL: Oh, shit, man. I'm so sorry. I heard about Tara. What'd you hear? People be trying to say that you killed her, man, but I know that's bullshit, man. Hey, look at me. I know that's bullshit. You know who did it? Yeah, I know. I need your help. Alright. I need you to help me hide this car, - and I need to borrow your van. - Yeah, yeah. Anything you need, man. - But I'm gonna go with you. - No. I can't let you do that, Sal. I can't let you get involved with this. I'm already involved here. You're asking me to hide a police car in my yard. - No, no. - SAL: Hey. Look at you, man. I'm not letting you do this alone. You wanna stop talking about it and go do this thing? I don't like this, Sal. I don't like this one bit. Just remember what to say if they come asking. I don't think you should do this. He'd do the same thing for us, okay? I'm really sorry, Nick. - Leave the light on for us. - MARLENE: Okay. Don't get yourself in trouble, Sal. - SAL: [SMOOCHES] - [VEHICLE DOOR OPENS] [VEHICLE DOORS CLOSE] [ENGINE STARTS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON P.A.] - FRANK: God damn it. - I'm sorry, Frank. God damn it! You get back over to his house. You arrest anybody that comes within 50 yards of that place. And you radio me right away if you do. - You got that? - Yes, sir. NICK: Keep it running. [BREATHES DEEPLY] What's up, man? - Nothing? - Nothing. You wanna try that place off 90? NICK: Yeah. Yeah? [ENGINE IDLING] CLERK: Hold on a minute. May I help you?

Nick! Oh. Nick! Hey, man. Just talk to me for a second, son. Don't disappoint me, boy. [CHUCKLES] You got me. Talk to me. You owe me that. Just talk to me. NICK: I told her when we got married that she would not have to worry. Told her I'd be there for her. Promised. She was the only real thing I had in this life. [GUN SLIDING] Still gonna have to take you in, Nick. No. I ain't going to prison. FRANK: I don't blame you for what you done. I don't. But justice isn't yours to serve. This ain't the wild, Nick. You should've let the law handle it. The law wouldn't do what I did. Law's the only thing keeps us from being savages. Like I said, I can't go to prison, so you do whatever you gotta do. FRANK: I tell people I served this town for 30 years. That my blood is in this dirt. And in all that time, I only ever did one bad thing. If you wanna call it that. Maybe that's entitlement. Maybe not. Whatever it is, though... ...it's a choice I can live with. Imagine if they let Samson go instead of shackling him to the temple. May have been a different outcome altogether. Imagine that. [DOWN-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS]
