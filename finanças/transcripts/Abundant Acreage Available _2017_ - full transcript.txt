Out here in the middle of the field? Seems appropriate. Well, it's not. Can I just go on? I don't care for you to be here. I think... I don't care what you think. You don't seem to care what anybody thinks but yourself. Go away. So, what are we doing in the spring, we just plow around him? You can kiss my ass for all I care, Jesse. I don't think this is funny, it's disrespectful. He deserves a proper burial in a proper place. I'm putting him here Jesse, in the earth, right here, right now, you don't like it, you can take a flying leap. What do you want? You want to put him up in that columbarium at Prospect United Methodist? Maybe we go visit him once a week or month, bring him some flowers that will just die and wilt in front of him? It's the way it's done, with a ceremony. From Pastor Goodwin, not that new girl. This is his place, here with us, with his two kids on his farm where he spent his life. This is where he should be for eternity. Tracy. Come on. Go. Whoa, whoa, no, no, no. Come on now. It may get spilled. You're all riled up. - Stop it. - Come on, I'm serious. I'm serious! Stop, stop it. - Come on. - Give it. Doing this. Got no grip left at all. I'm going to Costco later, you need some glucosamine? You wanna say something? What are you gonna do with yourself now? Say a prayer or something? Without him to take care of all the time? Why would you ask me that now? I just thought maybe you'd consider a vacation or something. You know what? You go if you want, you rent that house or condo you've been talking about. Me, I don't want to, I've got things to do. You wouldn't have to go to the lake, you could travel anywhere now. Good golly you're so mean. I'm not mean. Asking me that right now. I'm concerned, you know I'm not mean. I think you'd be tired and want to get away. Dad, God. Man. I mean? I am sick and tired. I hate this farm. No you don't, it's the grief talking. Heavenly Father, please accept your son in Christ, Edward James Ledbetter, to your bosom. He's passed from us, but his veil of suffering and his long battle with the cancer is finally over and we're grateful that he's no longer in pain. We pray that he knows, Tracy and I, that he knows his family will be taken care of and fine. Jesus' name, amen. _ Qkay. - Okay- - Why didn't you call him Bud? I called him by his Christian name. What, you don't think Jesus knows him as Bud? You going to mark it? I know where he is. An unmarked grave. What? - Tracy. - What? Listen. We'll leave him for the winter and then in the spring we put him in that old graveyard. What, out in the woods? It's not our people. It's sanctified. You don't think the field is healthy? I'll tell you what, I'll think about it. Moving Daddy. You hungry? It's getting colder. What, what are you doing? Well I dunno. Are they deer hunters? Well they can't just waltz onto our land and camp out like this. Well I don't see any guns. Wake them up. They're old. Think they're friends of Daddy's? Hey! Hey! You need to get up now. Help him. Here you go. ' Okay, I got it. Yeah. Whoa, whoa, hold on there. No, no, no. No, I don't, no, I wasn't going to. We excuse me, we're so sorry. You see our car, ! bet this looks kinda odd. He came up at me with a fucking gun. Sorry, he's been. What? Where's our house? Tom, be still. So you were saying something about your car? Yeah, it stopped running over where the cut off through the woods, you know, late last night. Really? So you hiked here? Hi, Hans Triggerston. How's that? Hans, and these are my two brothers. Charles. And Tom. Hi sir. Bastard. It's the stroke. Tom, be nice. Well I'm Jesse Ledbetter and this is my sister Tracy. This is our farm. I know where we are now. So where you all headed? Here. This is private property. No, we know that. Are you here to pay respects? Did you hear about our Daddy? Bud Led better? Yes sir, yes sir, he passed away one week ago today. My God, no, we can go. Yeah, we didn't have a formal service, we had just a family remembrance. Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't know you, that you were, that you knew, I didn't mean to be, you wanna come in? How did you know our daddy, if I may ask? Do you remember our late Papa at all? Are you all from around here? What'd you say your name was? Triggerston. Wow, you're the family in the graveyard. Yes, sure, we bought the place from Charlie Triggerston. I sure do remember him, I must have only been about five or six years old but I remember first time my daddy brought me out here because that was the first time I ever saw, well I remember your father. Crying- - And you say he's passed now too? I'm sorry to hear that. You must be the three boys from that day. - Yeah. - Good grief, what was that, 50 years ago? 49, 49 years, man, yeah. Tracy, you weren't even with us yet, you came right after. You all wanna come inside and warm up? - No. - Yeah, we're fine. We can help you get your stuff. No, we can leave it right here, it'll be just fine right here. Sure, you want to see your old home? When was the last time you were around here? It's 16 or so, we haven't been back since, none of us. 'Till now, so we wouldn't mind walking around a bit. Well be our guest. Sure, used to be yours. Yeah, okay, appreciate it. - You need help? - No, we're good. We're self-contained. - Change anything. - Well. Have you added on at all? Nope, no. Still the same 50 acres Daddy bought from y'all. Still small, still got tobacco. And we rotate corn and soy. Wouldn't consider selling it back, would you? What about your things? They're fine out there. It's a little untidy, there's only so much to do, got our hands full. I know, growing tobacco is a big job. Well, small farms don't make much sense anymore, but we're still here. Boy, it seemed bigger before? Alright. You got it? Whoa, slow down. I got him, watch your head up here. You used to jump over that. Geronimo! Thank you. Offer them breakfast. Yeah, okay. But get them out of here. They're crazy.

Really nice. You wouldn't believe those two fussing in the bathroom. It is nice. Where's the eldest kook? Well, they wanna see everything. Yeah, I know, it's like they're measuring. Tracy. I think we should sell. What? I've been praying over it and I may ask them if they want the place. That's nuts. Maybe just some acreage, maybe the woods, over where the graveyard stands and we could retire. Shit, this is our place and will be as long as I'm alive. I think God's looking after us by sending these brothers here. Hello? Boy, that's a long rise from down in that lower land, isn't it? Yeah, it sure is. Whoa, would you like to sit down?

Yeah, tomorrow we wanna tour downtown East Bend, see what's changed. How long you gonna hang around? Trace. You can't stay out there. We don't need to put you out. No, no, this isn't a campground. Well, we got our tent, a little Coleman stove, we'll be fine. No, I'm saying you can't stay on our land. You don't have to worry about us. We've always been campers. Maybe we should go start making our lunch. Now that's just stupid, I'm making lunch. That was really nice. Gentlemen, I have a little idea. So what's wrong with your car anyway? Did you call someone? _ _ - I did, they said they might come out early evening. We should head on over there. We got this little Latino who works on the car for us in Orlando and now I speak some Spanish, but he talks so fast that it's like a speeded up record. What do y'all do there? We run a little plumbing company. Plumbing, wow, did you hear that? Big operation or just y'all? Well let's just say we do okay. Well.

Did you come here to get your home back? Because I've been giving it a lot of thought and consideration, sir. I asked the Lord for guidance. Are you a religious man? I can't say that I am, no. Well I am. Have been since I turned my life around from Hell when I was 26 years old. And I have to say, if you and your brothers are still interested, I'm interested in talking. Well, well that's interesting. You could make it the way you remember it is the way I figure it. And of course with the foreign markets and such, tobacco farming is changing but, it's still good, it's still good, it is. I love it. Just like your mama and daddy did, I bet. And before that. Generations of Triggerstons buried here. Papa, he appreciated all that family history, of course. He was the sweetest man there was, my Papa. But he was a drunk man. Mama had him thrown in jail for 60 days, she did. And he came out, all of this was gone. She sold it to your family, cheap. He didn't believe it until it, until you fellows came out that day, and your father was, he was eager, yeah. I remember his face, he knew what kind of deal he got. Boy. That's not our life story I'm giving you. Just is the way things were. Got his ashes in a little urn and almost brought them up here with us thinking, can you imagine?

Charles is off, that's Tracy helping you. Would you like a donut, Tom? For the road? Where's Charles now? What do you need, Tom? You know where, don't you? Tracy. I asked Hans if he wanted our farm. We're not selling. Their farm. Did you tell them we're not selling? Their family farm. I'm not selling our farm, Mr. Triggerston. Charles told me he hoped you were heading home today. - Hans. - I'm not considering selling it anymore either. Good. It's theirs, it belongs to them. It's their land, we've got to give it back. Well I don't know what's going on. I'm saying give it back to them. It's the only thing to do. Daddy had no business to profit off another man's misfortune and neither do we. You're talking out of your hat. No, you and me, we've got the means to rectify this. He's as crazy as a loon. Crazy? What pact with the Devil will you make to hold on to what you have? You will not start talking to me like that again! - I will. - They're leaving! - It's time to let go! - What do you think you are? I will not have you spouting off one more word about it in front of these people, you hear me? Good God, give it away? - Give it back. - And you can't even decide. - Return it! - Something about something that's not yours alone to decide about anyway. I told you that last night, this is our farm. You hear me? Ours! Our family's! Ours! It's not your blood. What? Sorry, it's not. You're saying 'cause I'm adopted? My Lord. This is good. Excuse me, Jesse, but who are these people anyway? They could say they're Triggerston, but we don't know. Tracy, this is for our greater good. They could be scam artists telling us anything. If you'd stop... Jesse, you are not living in the real world. You don't just give away property like that. You and your higher power could maybe be wrong, - you know that! - May I... Will you please get him to stop? You hush! I wanna do this, I wanna put it to right. If there's one thing I've learned in this life, one thing, don't try to talk a man out of his convictions. Are you okay? What are those called, do you know? Starlings. Donut? Yes. Do you know what they're doing, my brother is? Jesse wants to give your family this farm, to give it back to you. Thought you said you were leaving this morning. Old men have fantastic ideas. Sick old men, like my brother Hans, it's crazy. Do they listen to me? What's wrong with him? Pancreatic cancer. That's fast. Why does he want our farm? Well, I think he's just like an old dog that's looking for a place to lay his bones down. Does your brother wanna sell? Yeah. My brother. Did you scrape your hand? Let me. Is it? There you go. Keep going. My brother, when he was younger, there was drinking, you know, and drugs, and screaming fights and we had a strict father, especially after Mama died. Jesse hated farming. So he took off. And he became a father at 19 and one time camping, Jesse was passed out drunk and his three year old unzipped the tent and wandered into the Yadkin River. Good Lord, look at that. It's like a single thing flying there together. After a really hard time, Jesse found the Lord. He came back, never took another drop, never mentioned it and just every day, get through the tasks, just us three. And then Daddy got sick so we took care of that. That's all any of us really got, I suppose. What, day to day? Family. Taking care of family, mopping up, do it again tomorrow. He always wants to finish things neat, you know? Yells at me when I can't keep up, keep a clean house, throw things away, he says throw it away, Tracy. That's him and Daddy. Yeah, I'm a pack rat. God, me too. God, you know, no. You should see our place, it's it's always something. It gets overwhelming. I think he's afraid to hold on to things, he's lost too much. Maybe that's the right way to be. When you've got nothing really to hold onto. LQtlS SQQ h F QWI S V0 "I": Fine, fine. My stuff, include it when you burn off the old crop to replant. This is not right! Come on, let's go. Where? To the car. Hans? Well. I don't burn. You turn onto her, you know? She's being dramatic. Should we get you a burger too? Tracy. I'll get it all out, 'cause it's nothing, it's all nothing, I thought it was mine but it's nothing, so burn it! I'll pray for Ya- You're still in mourning. It's just. - Are your teeth chattering? - Nope. Look, why don't we go in? He asked us again. We're gonna do good here, okay? We'll just snuggle up okay? We're gonna be fine. Yeah, yeah, this is good. Look, when are we going home? No, we gotta just see how things play out first. You can't be serious. Get in your sleeping bag. Come on baby. So you think we should offer them money, don't you? You're asking me what I think? I think you should grab that piece of ass, man, while she's shaking it in your face. But this is an opportunity. I think we should all be at home. 'Cause you're a homebody. We can never pry him out of his shell. You like her? Shut up. Would you move over? You know, she's not bad looking, really. You talking to me? Tune you guys out. You could both have the land. She'd know how to run things. I think Jesse'd go for it. He could retire like he wants and you know what about when Tom goes too? You don't have anybody that needs you. Would you shut the hell up, both of you? God dammit! Charlie! You like the dirt. I can tell. You feel like an orphan now? What? I'm 68 years old, I still feel that way. I have a son who died. Not a day goes by I don't think of him. Even more than my late wife. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Yeah, I'm sorry your father's gone. I know what that's like. You just want to hold his hand again, I bet. Hear his voice. Chat about nothing much. Feel sick to your tummy? Does it wash over you in waves? It'll pass. Charles told me. I wanna be buried here on his farm, and I want you to help me. Our Charles that never had a girlfriend, not once. Spent his whole life as a nurse maid. Now what? Well I'm not gonna be here. It's a fantastic thing to be no me. Okay listen, he'll get along. He'll be okay. No, no I don't believe he will. No, my daddy worried about the exact same thing. We're fine. Are ya? Will you be? Will you consider it? Consider what? My brother Charles, he likes you. You two could both together, things need looking after. Tracy, hold on. Tracy, hold on here just a minute. You seen my blow up float? You didn't throw it on your pile, did you? I bought it, I wanna sleep on it. They all tucked in? Getting there. Hans is in your room, the others are down here. Thought I could put a pallet on the floor in the front room, maybe it's gone. Come here. - 0h, shit! - You okay? Thank you. They were singing. _ They brushed their teeth, gathered around, started singing earlier. How'd they sound? Not bad. Why didn't they ever come before? _ It could all have been different. How much do you think it's worth? Just ballpark. I'm just curious, Charles was asking. Yeah? Yeah. He asked you? Jesse. Do you think Daddy... What? Forget it. What, Tracy? I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. You can move all your stuff back in tomorrow if you want. You ever remember Daddy kissing you or hugging you? Do you think that's why I never, do you think that's why I'm cold? I don't think you're cold. I think I'm cold. Or maybe just not warm. You're a good person. Thank God they're leaving tomorrow? Will you and Charles be in touch? Tom was the nicest one, then he had a stroke, it changed his personality completely. Yeah, I know, Hans told me. Isn't that something? Maybe it killed some part of his brain, the nice part. Mean was all that was left. Well the Devil will take any opportunity to get in, if he sees weakness. We're tested, if we're not up for the challenge, if we're weak, then the Devil takes advantage and evil is born. Come on, it isn't the Devil, it was a burst blood vessel. It would be a lot to deal with. It's not his fault. I can stab a scarecrow. Yeah. When the crops come up, I can't remember. All covered tobacco. Yeah, it was real pretty in the spring. Too little when we left. Yeah. 12. 12? That's not so, you can't remember? I lost a lot. Why don't you sit? They won't be long. Gassing the car. Yeah. - Home. - Yeah. You want us to stay? Well. Just some of us. You're thinking about it. I could get you some coffee, you want me to go get you some coffee? I want you to stay right here. Okay- - With me. Come over here. Sit on my lap. Sit on my face. That's a long drive you got, y'all stop? You ever drive to Florida? Me? No, I haven't been to Florida at all. Come! Stay with us, you'd like it, we have a nice place. Big rooms, sleep with us. Okay, Tom... I mean it! I don't wanna hear that. Yes you do. So you be still, okay? Big cocks. Okay Tom, you be quiet, that's not nice. And I know you can be nice. Nice. Here. - You sit. - No, Tom, you stay. I want to be nice to you. I'm fine standing. Please. Accept. Clear, okay. Alright, I'll sit, sit for a bit. Thank you. 'Cause you are a sweet girl, you are. I'm gonna see what's taking them so long. Please, stay. Okay- - Don't pay me no mind. Okay- - I think you are a nice girl. Just bothered by strangers. People saying they're going to take your home maybe. Maybe not. Scary old men. I know I'm scary. You okay? You okay? Let me lick your pussy. Let me fuck your ass. Stop it, stop it! Hey! Hey! Hey, something's happened. Tom fell! Hey, Tom? Hey, can you hear me? Let me turn you on your side. Do you have a cell? Mine's in the car. Come use the phone in the house. - Stay with him. - Go. He just fell? He blinked and he looked funny. I'm sorry, he won't be long, they'll be okay. It's not your fault. He was saying off things to me. I'm right here, buddy. Help's coming. Gosh, I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My God. Are you okay? Will you put me out here too? Not in the cemetery, out here in the open, like your daddy. We've been talking about coming back in a few weeks to finalize things, maybe bury my papa too, but now. Wait, are you taking it? Are You? Are You? Will you agree to my request, Miss Tracy? Are you taking my home? I just wanna be put back where I came from. What are you gonna do, Hans? Hey, you're a mess. I'm right here, buddy, I'm right here. Help's coming. It's all temporary. How many bones have been put in this ground, do you think, that we don't know about? Civil War, you know, slaves. Before that, the Indians, all mixed in. I wonder, I wonder sometimes if it's cursed 'cause we didn't keep it sacred. Harming it. Tobacco, what that's meant. You know, Hans? If you're dying, I guess you can't take my farm, can you? I'll put you out here, what do you think of that? It's so hard to let go. So hard to let go for everybody. Jesse? Lord. Dear Charles, again, I wanna say I'm sorry for the reason, but we look forward to seeing you when you come next week. Please consider staying the night with us. Especially because the motel on the main highway is not that nice. Although it is not a fleabag. The owners are Dot and Billy Wadlin and they're getting on, but as you and I both know, it's hard to stay on top of things. I'm rambling, but it is nice to sort of talk to you again in this fashion. I know it's been a difficult time for your family, and I am sorry. Please be our guest. We could maybe go for a stroll if you had the time. I think I write stupid emails, sorry. Yours very sincerely, Miss Tracy Ledbetter. PS, dress warm, it's clear and cold but very pretty with the sky so blue here usually. See you soon. I know you don't want any fuss. Hans told me what he want... Yeah, I know. Amen. No, please, let me. Um, I can do it. I don't know if they have to be all lined up like that, all exact, you know, could be sort of freeform. What do you want? Doesn't matter. You two could sit if you want. This isn't bad. Okay, alright. There. Can I hold that for you? Who's that? That's Hans. That's Tom. And this is Papa. Well, I guess it doesn't matter which one goes where. Just remember who's who. Who's that? Hans? Hans, this is Tom. Okay well. I know this is Papa. Are they marked? My God, this is awful. I know, but. BOY- - May I say a few words? No, this is sufficient. Bless these souls, Lord. Welcome them to your heavenly kingdom with open arms. Grant Charles solace in his grief, and bless your humble servants Tracy and myself as we continue to mourn the loss of our father, and of our new friends. In Jesus Christ's name, we praise you, Lord. Amen. Now I wanna tell you something. I'm leaving this land. We have the sacrosanct remains of four men buried here, and I cannot ignore that or look around it or plow or plant where they lie, this now is yours. What? There's something here that we have no right to. God's leading us to a new life, whatever that may be. Charles, you may do with it as you see fit. Maybe you could sell it if you don't want to stay here. I can't believe you've been hatching this this whole past month and never breathing a word. If you do sell it, maybe you'd consider sharing some of it with some of my sister. Whatever you two think is right. What? Maybe Charles will show you their house in Orlando now. Maybe that'd be something you'd enjoy. Um. God, Jesse. I don't think I'm ready for visitors just now. No, of course not, I apologize for my brother, I... I don't want this. I don't want anything. I didn't want you to pray. I wanna go home. - Of course you do. - By myself. Of course. I just wanna be left alone for once. Not called on, not badgered, not no one's beck and call, no one to clean up after but myself. Of course, I know exactly what you... All by myself. You do that, Charles, for now, but take it from me, one day you gotta pull yourself up and step back into life. Don't bury yourself with the dead. No. No. I don't have to do anything anyone says, I don't. I'm free of everyone, I'm 58 years old and I'm a free man, finally. In Florida, there's a couch that's mine now, and my room and a bottle and that's all I want. I've given enough. I'm tired. Of course you are. No more singing. Okay. I'm going now. God bless you, Charles. God help him. Sorry, Tracy. For what? Well I'm sorry for you. He's boxed himself in. Some people, they can't help it. Maybe time, takes time. Forgiveness. That's why this is so important for us to do, Trace. To sell. To take action now. I hope you can see that. Left him a mark. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, so to speak. No that's not what that means, it doesn't mean forget. No, you hold onto them? You gotta work, by God. Every single day I work to forgive myself. I don't forget. I try to forgive myself. We're only human. I know my Lord forgives me, that's all one can do. I never could get Daddy... It gets dark so quickly. You know, all those years taking care of him. He never once, lately I've been picturing us dead and gone. Who would give a damn? The name would run out. Let's go inside. It's not my name anyway, I wonder what my name was. Should have left it all out here and had a bonfire. I'll do this tomorrow, I wanna take the suit off. When do you plan to go? Fishing. I'll put the farm on the market as soon as I get things in order. Things in order? Yeah, you and I can decide where we want to go. I have to move poor old Tom and Hans, all of 'em, I'll do it first thing tomorrow. To where? You know, consecrated land. It's the only thing to do. Daddy too? Of course. I'm sorry but, you agreed to consider the move, now we have to, do you see that? Now, come on, please, I don't want you getting sick. It's so easy to catch a cold. Come on inside and I'll make us something warm. Maybe some hot chocolate, how's that sound? Come on honey, don't linger.
