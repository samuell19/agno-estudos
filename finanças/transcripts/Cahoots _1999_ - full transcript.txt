Who's worked under me. They've been great. And all our proposals as well. I'm always challenging them and working closely with all the department heads. - [Omari] Okay, cue the host and tell her to stretch the interview out. I need eight more minutes. - [Jessica] How did you make a difference so quickly? Was it because of your past acting show? Renee Gonzales starred in three Devonaire production movies in the '80s that all did well at the box office. - [Renee] Well I'd just like to thank Mauro Albano for taking me underneath his wings and teaching me how to be assertive and to believe in myself. Working with him has made me become a better person. Initially I graduated into political science and minored in English literature. And when Mario approached me and I debated it and then gave it a chance and enjoyed it. - I like to thank superintendent Renee for joining us on KDEB. (Indistinct talking) (Loud whistling) (jazz music) - See I told you we have the best producer and director in the business. We'll take care of you. - Well gentlemen, it was nice to meet you both.

(light music) - Girl's here man, start shooting in 10 minutes. Yeah, I guess. Since Marissa and I have been get serious I feel little bit weird about this, but she knows what we're doing. - You did tell her that this was your idea, right? That you needed a partner.

You'll be all right. - Well I don't have a booty call tonight. So what the hell? - Cool. - What about your girl Marissa? - Ah she's out of town on a teacher's resource program, she goes to all those things. I really like that. A woman who's doing things and on the move. - Yeah you got a cool one dawg, don't let her go. - Never. - Check it out, I'll stop by the crib so I can get a sweater or something. - Sounds great. - Alright? - Let's go. - [Narrator] Well, this isn't a rave party.

They loved our style. They said anything we do they'll buy. - Great. - So when you write me off? - Let's do it at lunchtime. - Cool. Shit was too easy, dude. - I know. So we got to do some more. Definitely. I mean, this is just the beginning. I can see my dreams coming true. - It's all good. Let's get one thing straight. I don't plan on making this no career. I just want some quick chips. I can invest in some property. - I know. I know. That's exactly what I'm thinking in and out. Cause my girl was definitely not my a biggest fan. - Hey, my two favorite employees, listen, I got some great news. We have just been nominated for the Peabody award.

It's almost lunchtime. Let's go get paid. - I see this shit, but I don't believe it. - Come on. Let's go to the bank. - [Narrator] The mobsters. These guys run the porn industry. They need to speak with Omari and Chris about fees. - Man what the fuck is this? - [Chris] The fuck are you guys? - Shut the fuck up and listen. You guys are cutting into our porn business. No, we want our cut or we'll put you punks out of the business forever. - Man fuck you. Don't tell him. (men fighting and cussing) - That's enough That's enough. Hey kid, pick him up. I'm going to tell me one more time. We want 20% of every single movie you guys make. And by the way we know you work at KDEB. Don't have us get them involved. It's just one like that. And that's your guys' ultimatum. - You know? (laughing) You guys do really good work. Nice pussy I see. Keep up the good work. - Well, I guess gentlemen, we're in cahoots. (struggling, fighting) - I ain't take that shit man. Fuck that man. - How the fuck did they find us?

I'm going to slow your roll. - Let's do this. (overlapping chatter) - Philippe, Omari's real cousin in the black shirt and big time baller and shot-caller in the town. Omar is the only one that calls him Philippe. Everyone else calls him, bro. - [P] So, this is Omari, this is Lay-Low, Raheem and Stack. Alright let's get back in his game, man. (overlapping chatter) - Come on dawg, it's on you. - Phillipe. - Yo, slow your roll. Gentlemen, we need to put this game on hold. - What? What you mean? Come on, man. (overlapping arguing) - I gotta talk to my cousin. You know what I'm saying? Come on man, let me have my business, man. - Hold on man. We can take a break, man. Let's just go and let you handle your business. (overlapping chatting and arguing) All right. Have a seat. So what's on your mind. - Man, I just got jumped by some mother fuckers who said they run the porn business. They know what the KDEB and they know about my boss. You're the only person that knew about the porns and where I worked at. It's like you set me up for something. - You know I wouldn't do that. And we'd family don't ever think that, but let me tell you something. It's my bad. Maybe I'll gave up a little too much info. Like you fuck me up before I could even get started. You know? I ain't got time for fucking with the mob. The fuck am I supposed to do? - Man don't worry about that. I told y'all I'll handle it. I got you into this and I'll get you out. - What'd you saying? You got wires on these phones or something? - Maybe, maybe not, but check it man. You know when I went out for the baseball team in jr high? Man, the only reason I went out there, cause I wanted to hang with, you know, you made the family proud, good grades in school. You did good on the team. And you finished college. You know, I started bragging, bragging to everybody about what you did. You know? The porn you guys was doing, you know things you guys was doing.

It's not that bad. - Well, I may have fucked that up too. - What? - I told my cousin. And he told the goons. - What were you thinking? - I don't know. I wasn't thinking. Look, I told him, but I didn't know what was gonna lead to all this man. I just want to squash everything and get out plain and simple. - No, I'm not going to let you walk away from this man.
