Syncro: F.B Cavalcante Come on. I can't stay here. I've got to go. I'm going. What have we here? Now, my friends, something that could mean a great deal to you for your future. Hey presto! Who will find one of these for me? You? It could be yours. Who will come with me this time? No takers? You'll come with me, won't you? You want what I offer. Yes. She's made her choice, of her own free will. Leave her. I've got to go.... Well, are you all enjoying yourself? - Enough champagne? - Yes. Admiring your flowers. You couldn't have picked a better time of year to see them. I mean, look. What the? Hello. I say. Now, we'll have to get you some proper clothes. And prepare a room. Yes, thank you. Let's see now. What can we find for you in here? Your move. We know, Dane. We can do nothing for her. She's made her own choice. He's prepared for your reply. He wishes for a guide into the wilderness. Why? He wants to challenge the illusionist. He says he will try to enlist the help of the man who appeared. The man who appeared is not one of us. He lives in the wilderness because he wishes to be alone. Although he has certain skills, he wishes no contact with us. We can give you no help in this enterprise. This stranger has been an unknown factor too long. But we cannot stop you. This is it, Tanya. This is where you must search. Find the little things I want, the mechanisms I've lost. They are as I've described them to you. T The work is hard. You will either earn merit or you will not. Tanya, find me just one part, and you will have your freedom, and all that you desire. Take it. When you have something for me, you'll find me. Can you help me? I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Food and drink. Go home. One has escaped. Ladies and gentlemen, a chase! Well done. But we have to work for our privileges. Listen, I don't know who you are, but you are disturbing my contemplation. I no longer have any interest in human affairs, do you understand? I'm a pilgrim. I ask nothing of the people of this planet and I give nothing back. You don't understand, do you. You can't hear and you can't speak. And yet you're here... So far from anywhere. You're going somewhere. You're on a journey. And the people of your village don't approve, otherwise they'd have sent someone with you? You're looking for something. You have a mission. No, it's me. You're looking for me. You need my help. No! Whatever you've heard about me, it's not true, not any more. I... I misunderstood the nature of the universe. Very nice. Who is she? A friend of yours. A very good friend. And yet she's not with you. Now why not. You seem upset. Upset? Of course I'm upset. You just killed that girl. She was a criminal. You have to earn privilege. You do get upset by the smallest things. Still, I'm sure you'll come to understand us... In time. No. I have to go. I don't think there can be any question of that. Why not? It'll soon be dark. We can't possibly let you go wandering off alone, not while we've room for you here. Besides, I very rarely have the company of one so... Now I'm alone. I had to send her away. This was no life for her. I have to endure me, she has a choice. You see, I'm not a hero. I make mistakes... And people die. You don't want my help. You're not still angry with me, are you? You really have no idea, do you. I'm sure our little customs will seem strange to you at first. These people have been through a lot, you see. You make me wish I'd stayed with... With who? A friend. And why did you leave your friend? Our lifestyles didn't agree. What about our lifestyle? How do you like that? It can be difficult, you know, seeing the same faces all of the time. Even with all these people about me... I still feel somehow... Alone. Do you ever feel alone? This approach is insufficient.. If you'll excuse me, I'll retire now. You know where I am if you should need me. Come on, then. Show me where she is. How long? Useless. Useless. Useless! Your friend, in there? Right. The question is, how do we get in? The gate is always open for those going in. - I've been looking for you. - And I you. I surprise you? Not really. That clown with the gun. Robot? He is a part of me. An aspect of my mind. And I suppose there are others. Other puppets. Yes. Do not be deceived by his appearance. Must weaken you, splitting yourself apart. And do not be deceived by mine. You are an alien to this world. Yes. And you are stranded here. Never search for answers in a place where you will not find them. You're using these people to try and find a means of escape. You come from an advanced culture. And you think I might have the technical skills to help you. I may have the answers which you seek. My ship is in orbit. It can wait forever. I cannot. My shuttle was destroyed on impact. Where is she? Here. Good. You are so lucky. What's wrong with her? The work is soul-destroying. Literally. They come to realise you can trust and care for nothing but yourself. You control their minds. I allow them to realise their desires. And for that privilege they pay. These two can no longer interact. She believes she has earned superior status because I allow that belief. What do you offer these people? I give them clothes, trinkets, nothing of value. It's all an illusion. I create within their minds the belief that they're entitled to certain things, so these things become real. So long as you are here to sustain them. There are things you want. I want nothing from you. You will free these people. And your cheap tricks have no effect on me. Where is she? Safe. I could have her killed instantly. But you won't. No. Because you will help me. Show me. Transporter. A little crude, but most of it's there. It won't work. I know it won't work. Make it work. And you will free these people? All of them. When I leave, I will have no need of them. Start now. It's no use coveting a Louis Quinze. You've nowhere to put it. I mean, ridiculous. Hello... Welcome. Well now, we'll have to prepare you a room. I'm not sure I really want to be here. You and me both. Careful. You have taken a big step. You'll learn to adjust, or you won't. How long? Well, it's hard to say. This is burnt out... - I'll have to bypass that... - How long! It's hard to say. You have the ability to complete it now. You are stalling me. How can I be sure you'll keep your side? The only thing you can be sure of is that I will kill your friend unless you finish the work now. Very nice. Look, were you serious about wanting to get away from here? I don't know. It's not like I expected. I thought I'd be happier, somehow. There's something going on here. I don't know what it is, but they kill people. Why? I don't know why. But I'm getting out of here, and if you've got any sense... I wonder where he's going? The tip. Is that where you came from? That's where Dane is. And the man who appeared. Look, I'm going. Are you coming? - I don't know. - Come on. - You have finished? - Yes. You must dissolve your illusions first. I cannot do that until I am whole. - We had a deal. - Which I choose not to honour. But if you leave without removing your influence, you'll burn out their minds. You'll kill them all! When I activate, the area around me will become highly charged. Stand back if you value your own life, because I do not. I don't understand. That machine was perfect. I think I'm ready to go back now, if you'll come with me. - No more contemplation? - No. No more shutting yourself away from the universe? It's not really me. I could have told you that. Yes.
