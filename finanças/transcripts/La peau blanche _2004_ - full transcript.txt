''People of color.'' Can't we just say ''Black''? - That's just a minority. - l hear ''people of color'' a lot. l don't get it. People of color should be white people. We have black hair, black eyes and black skin. Black is not a color, it's the absence of color. You folks are supposedly ''white,'' with your yellow hair, your blue eyes, your pink skin! - You're the ones who are colored. - l've read that argument before. Every time l have a great idea, l'm told someone else had it before me. - Did you read ''Little, Big''? - No. That was my idea. lt was stolen from me. Not all Black people are black. Some are light brown. Mulatos are brown. Black people are black. Fuck the philosophy, man. Keep it simple. What you do is pointless, which means it is useless. Nobody wants to be useless. That's what makes us human. Well, studying literature can turn you off from being a writer. What do you mean? Enough books are published each year. We don't need a new one. But what would you say if that genius author of yours had seen things that way? l guess. But Michel Tremblay is gay. lt's like you, you could write. You're Black. l'm just a straight white man. That's my problem. l'll never sell. l know what you need. lt's been at least six months. lt'll clear your head. They won't give us the time of day. Not if you have money. Well l don't have any. My father doesn't pay my bills. lt's on me, then. Even if you buy a girl drinks all night, you'll still go home alone. l don't think you get it. lt's on me. They're hookers? They're pros. Let's go unwrap your gift. We can take our time. l don't get a nice guy from Gaspe Bay very often. - Are you here visiting? - No. - l live in Montreal now. - ls that right? - Have you been here long? - No. Listen, l don't think it's going to work out. Of course, it's going to work out. You'll see. l don't think l want to. You can keep the money. - ls Marquise more your type? - Marquise? No. l don't like redheads. Guys usually go for Marquise. lt's okay, l'm used to it. l told you, l don't like redheads. - ls it the hair color? - lt's not the hair. lt's the skin. That white skin makes me nauseous. lt's like l can see through it-- the flesh and veins. Don't red-haired guys make you sick? l don't know... lt's like being intimate with someone, but being forced to. Like when you cut your tongue with an envelope, but worse. You know what l-- l'm not being very clear... Listen. - Someone's screaming. - Huh? Can't you hear? ls that Henri?! - What's going on here? - Just stay out of it. - Henri? - Hurry! Hurry! - What the-- - The knife! We've got to get out of here. Are you gonna be okay? Are you okay? - Do l look okay? - Hold still. lt'll stop bleeding. Put your shirt on. Give me your hand. Shit, you're bleeding again. - Put pressure on it. - Call an ambulance. lt's all right. lt's not that bad. l don't want to die here! Call an ambulance! We can't get the police involved. We'll have to tell them we were in that fucking whore house! My parents will kill me. l need to sit down. - ls there a hospital near here? - Saint Luke. Can we make it on foot? Fuck! Are you all right? Nothing in the paper. You think the doctor believed us? Why not? There's more skinheads than whores attacking Blacks, right? Are you going to tell me what happened? What happened is, the girl tried to kill me. - Don't ask me why. - l mean, before l came in. - Did you scare her? - Of course not. - You didn't ask her-- - For a receipt? Sorry, l forgot. No, l mean... you didn't force her to do... - something she didn't want to do. - What are you saying? Everything was fine. She even found me attractive. Until she pulled a blade. You know what that bitch said? ''Close your eyes. l have a surprise for you.'' lf l hadn't peaked, l wouldn't be telling you about it. - lt doesn't make any sense. - There's nothing to understand. - Yo, Thierry! - How's it going? - Good. ls Henri here? - Yeah. ls that a patch? l didn't know you smoked. Come on... Did you shave too close? - No, it's nothing. - What do you mean, it's nothing? - What happened? - l'm going to tell you, but keep it to yourselves. They killed my son! They killed my son! No, l swear l'm fine. - Sweet Jesus! - Sit down, please! Could you all be quiet for awhile? Be quiet, please. Please, be quiet! Can l say something, damn it?! Let's get this story straight. Come this way, please. Your testimony is important. Now tell me what this bandage is about. Did you go to the hospital? Saint Luke's hospital. Why didn't you call the police? Why didn't the doctors call the police? ls that normal? ls it normal to get attacked? Do you think you could identify the attackers? Speak up! lt was dark. There were four guys with shaved heads wearing Docs. - We didn't ask for their lDs. - Details are important-- tattoos, slogans on their shirts. l don't know. lt was dark. There are lights on the streets. Little details will help identify them. The police must already have a file on them anyway. Fuck the police! We'll find those skinheads. And we'll break their fucking legs! Stop it, or the police will come after us! - Let them come, then. - Eddy! lt's revolting that nobody helped you. - Did you ask for help? - lt was late. - There was nobody on the street. - Nobody on Saint Catherine Street? We weren't on Saint Catherine per se. Nobody helped because he's just a nigger! lf he had been attacked, l bet someone would have stopped. Know what l mean? Know what l mean?! Good taste. You can come out. - Has everybody left? - Almost. My girlfriend stayed out of pity. You think they're going to come down? Don't worry about it. They're upset, but they'll take a deep breath and forget about it. You're acting weird. l'm surprised you're not more upset. That's enough. l'm getting hungry here. Shall we grab a bite? - Good idea. - Sure. MUTlLATED BODY - Excuse me, Professor Th?oret. - Yes? l'm in your Thursday morning class. l'd like to talk about my grade. That sheet's supposed to be on the notice board. l know, but l have a problem with my grade-- Excuse me, but l have a meeting. Come by my office. My office hours are on the syllabus. lt can't wait. The revision deadline is approaching and if l fail this class, l'll lose my scholarship for next year. Didn't you write that paper on Michel Tremblay? l did. l can't have a D+. - Listen-- - l know all he's done. - l've read his work many times. - Listen. Michel Tremblay is not exactly the best subject to write on. He's a genius and he's a literary influence. Let's not get carried away here. Michel Tremblay has quickly understood that what people like is soap operas. That's why he always writes about the same characters. Tremblay's work is one big soap for baby-boomers. You can't be serious. His work has some mythical undertones. All stolen from Greek theatre. Listen, we're not going to talk literature in the hallway. And for this, l moved all the way to in Montreal. Will you calm down? Come by my office and we'll discuss your grade. ln the meantime, put that back where you found it. You're not the only student in this department. That's disgusting. l slept through my classes. You alarm woke us up. You didn't wonder why l wasn't getting up? - l'm not your mother. - Are you okay? - You don't look well. - l didn't sleep well. Remember when l got home last night? What, are both your brain cells dead? Serious, l don't remember. l don't even remember what time l got home. lt was about 8:00. You watched some of the movie, then you went to your room. - You don't remember? - Were you hammered? Maybe you're hungover right now. l remember the movie, but it's kind of a blur. lt's all a blur except for the girl. What girl? Some girl at school. She's pretty. To me, at least. lf she made you lose your memory, she must be hot. Who is she? - A redhead. - What? l don't get it. She's a redhead. - So what's the problem? - Thierry hates redheads. l didn't want to tell you, but hating redheads is racism based on hair color. lt's not racism, it's just that l don't like looking at them. How strange. And she doesn't mind? l didn't talk to her. l saw her play music in the metro. lt's love at first sight! Can't be love. She's a redhead. You fell in love with what you hate. lt happens all the time. We turn into what we hate most. Let him be. - You're such a pain in the ass. - Are you okay? l'll try and catch my last class. ''One Hundred Years of Solitude''... ''Don Quixote''... ''War and Peace''... ''Divine Comedy.'' MUSlC DEPARTMENT lt was very good. l really enjoyed it. - Thanks. - That kind of music... it's powerful, it's new. lt's from the '50s. But it's quite modern. lndeed. l was sure you played the flute. l mean, l saw you play in the metro. l do that on the side, to make ends meet. l'm Thierry. You play really well. Thank you. l've always liked the flute. And the piano, too. l just wanted to tell you... you're very beautiful. Do you want to have dinner? - We could have a bite on Saint Denis. - l don't think so. We could talk about what's bothering you. - What's bothering me? - Yes. - You don't seem well. - You don't even know me. Sometimes it's easier to talk to strangers. l think you'd feel better if you ate a little something. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Anything to drink? - Do you have imported beers? - l'll bring you the list. - No beer for me. l know the owner. He's paying. - Thank you, but l don't like alcohol. - Okay. - A large beer for me, then. - A pint? - Yeah. - l'll have some tea. - So you're not from here. - That's right. lt's that obvious? You can say it. ls it obvious? Good evening. Good evening. Can you drop me off on Market? You're going farther, right? 26th avenue, please. Hold on. You okay? - That was crazy. - Yeah, it was! - Are you leaving? - l don't usually do this. - Did you cheat on your boyfriend? - l don't have a boyfriend. - Come on, stay for awhile. - l can't. Wait. - Did l do something wrong? - Of course not. Can we see each other again? - lf you want to. - Of course l want to. Tomorrow afternoon, 2:00. At the school entrance. All right. Bye. - Hi! - Hi! - What? - What?! Last night, l thought we were being broken into. Lucky l heard your girlfriend. Your red-haired girlfriend. - What's her name again? - Claire. l guess fear of redheads is not hard to get over, huh? l still don't like redheads, but with Claire, it's not the same. - You were definitely duped. - She needed it even worse than me. lt's actually weird. lt's true. l feel like a vegetable, like it was all a dream. That girl is really special. Yeah, it's really special to leave in the middle of the night. - Does she live far from us? - l don't know. We didn't talk a whole lot. Hot redhead, no address, fucks like a pro-- - lt's very ''film noir,'' you know? - Shut up. l'm telling you, l'm glad you moved fast. She's the kind of girl you won't see again. No kidding. l'm meeting her in a half hour. Don't you have class this afternoon? Henri. - Any messages? - Your mother didn't call. l bet her number's unlisted. Many girls do that. May l speak to Claire? Sorry about that. l'm telling you, she just wanted to get laid. Hello? Yeah. We weren't that wild. Yeah, he's right here. Sweetie? Hold on. l'm going to my room. Can you hang up? l wanted to apologize. l was a little rude last time. - Are you all right? - l'm fine. What happened? Like l said, l was rude, but l still think l deserve a new grade. Come on, did you lose track of time? - You weren't in class yesterday. - l know. l had something to attend to. You missed your exam. l don't know what your excuse is, but rules are rules: there is no make-up exam. Hi. - Why are you doing this? - Forget about me, okay? Forget about you? Just like that? - lt'd be best for everyone involved. - Not for me. l have problems. Okay, l-- maybe l can help you. - Excuse me. - Why don't you talk to me? - You don't know me. - We know each other a little. Don't you get it? l have problems. That means l don't want to have to deal with you. My family already feels sorry for me. - Why would l feel sorry for you? - l don't owe you anything. We fucked, but that doesn't mean l owe you an explanation. l don't belong to you. l don't belong to anyone. l do whatever l want with myself, with my body. Now get over it. We have to stop doing that. - Were you dumping me earlier? - That's what l should have done. Why are you being so harsh? What's the problem? Are you quitting school? - Claire, l have the right to know. - What right? Because l love you. No, all you want is get laid. What kind of argument is that? Of course l want to get laid. Just as much as you do. lf you're faking it, you deserve an Oscar. - l knew it was a mistake. - But you still came. - Let go of me! - l won't. l won't let you run off like last time. Tell me what's going on. That's enough. Claire, listen to me. A week ago, my life was nothing. A big nothing. Until l saw you in the metro. The minute l saw your face, l couldn't get it out of my head. Since then, that's all l've been thinking about. l won't let you go. How can you possibly want me? l am so ugly. What? - That's not true at all! - l used to be more beautiful. - You are very beautiful. - That won't last for long. ls that it? You're afraid to grow old? - You think-- - You don't get it. l have cancer. - Hi. - Hi. ls there a problem with the TV? We were just watching a film. - How are you? - l'm good. l was just wondering how you were. l haven't seen you in a week. Didn't want to bug you. You have mail, and rent's due. Okay. l'll leave the money on the kitchen table. Good. - That's it? - That's it. - Come on, you're kidding? - Of course not. Are you a racist? l know you don't think it's right, but Black people make me uncomfortable. But with Henri, it's not the same. Henri is a good guy, and Sandra's very nice. l don't like Black people. l can't help it. So what should we do? l said yes. Okay, l'll go to your dinner, but l won't get all warm and fuzzy. - l have to go home. - We weren't done yet. Okay, l have to get changed and my cat is going to starve to death. Here we are. This is griot with rice and beans, a traditional dish. And here are some fried bananas. Nothing to do with the Vietnamese version. Right. What we call ''fried banana'' here is called ''banana figs'' in Haiti. And what do you call ''figs'' in Haiti? What are you saying? l've never lived there. - l'm as Canadian as you are. - Henri, don't start, please. l was born here. What's with that question? lf l were white, l wouldn't get that kind of question. Right, Claire? What do you think? With that kind of language, you sound like you want to be holier than the pope. To the pope, then. - ls everything all right? - She's not feeling well. - Maybe she needs something. - She'll be fine. - l'll go check on her. - She's fine. What's wrong with her? She does seem weird. Forget it. - Maybe she's pregnant. - Very funny. She could at least eat a little. Sandra cooked all day. - All this was your idea. - You could have declined the invite. - l don't know what she's doing to you. - What? - lf l were you, l'd ease off with her. - What's the problem? lf you stopped fucking a little and looked in a mirror, - you'd see you look like a junkie. - l'm not hungry anymore. The first chemotherapy treatment went well. What a trooper. But l'll keep you here. They told you? l was told she could leave the same day. Something came up on the blood test. lt's probably an error. l'll do the tests again. You're like me, you look pale. We're more sensitive to UV light. And there's this mark here. Everything will be fine. This is my home phone number. l don't give it to anyone... except to my favorite patients. See you tomorrow. Thank you. Are you all right? Thierry, let me introduce you to my family. - My mother Diane. - Nice to meet you. - My sisters, lsabel... - Hi. - Hello. - ...and Marquise. Hi. There was a problem. lt's probably an error. That's all l wanted to know. We'll come back soon. Thierry? Thierry? Are you all right? You're as pale as death. lt's the needles. They freak me out. - What are you doing? - What's your problem?! - What's going on here? - Don't you recognize me? l didn't recognize you with your hood on. You see Black guys taking stuff out of an apartment, they got to be robbers, right? Eddy... - You know my aunt Marie-Pierre. - Hi. Are you moving out? - l'm going to live with Sandra. - What? lt was a sudden decision. - You're moving out? - Are you kidding? Since you've been with that girl, l've been feeling like a stranger in my own place. - l'm not big on dirty looks. - l give you dirty looks? - Claire does. - You don't understand. l understand very well. l understand your situation. That's the way it is. You share a place, and after a while, your roommate gets a girl and you just pack your stuff and go. That's no problem. l just made the decision before there's a fight. Are you done? - That's not what's going on. - So what's going on? - What's going on? - Hey, it's minus 20! Why not go upstairs instead of freezing our asses off here? Same results. l did the analysis. The adrenaline is sky-high, TSH near zero. lmpossible. She'd be having a heart attack right now. And her hormones aren't responding. lmpossible. And it's not a computer error. Julien? Get me her family's contact information, please. - ls she dying? - We don't know. l'm sorry, l didn't know. - lf you want me to, l'll stay. - No. Go live with Sandra. - Are you sure? - Yeah. l'll even help you move out. lmagine when you're Black and you have skin cancer. What do you mean? A dark spot on black skin is harder to notice. That's what we are. Black spots on Quebec's white skin. - A cancer! - Honey, what are you saying? The color black doesn't have anything to do with cancer. ln fact, black is the normal human color. Black or white, nobody's more normal than the other. Thierry, do you believe in science? Yeah, l-- One of Marie-Pierre's theories. Scientists have conducted a worldwide DNA survey. Do you know what they found? They found that nearly every single strain of human DNA is present in Black people. Asian and white races only represent a slim portion of the overall human DNA pool. They are mere variations of the original human. White people are nothing but mutants... - with watered-down genetics. - Marie-Pierre? - l love you. - That's exactly what l said. Redheads are abnormal. Their skin is too fragile. No, that's not what we agreed on, Henri. - l'm not crazy. - l'm not saying that. - l know what l said. - You said, ''Surprise me.'' Exactly! Surprise me by taking me out, surprise me by finding a job, not by showing up with all your stuff! l don't want to be pressured like this. - We've already taken all my stuff out. - Just put it back or give it to the Salvation Army, because l don't want it here. That whole think didn't make sense from the beginning. - You don't even have eyebrows. - No hair at all. For real? - l want you right here, right now. - No. - l can't take it anymore. - lt's too embarrassing. You've become my love drug. l miss it too much. l need it now. Someone could come in at any time. - l've got to go anyway. - Now? You just got here. l have a meeting with the department chair. - Stay a bit. - l can't. lf l fail, l lose my scholarship. l have to talk to them if l don't want to get sent home. You're beautiful. Enough is enough! Have you looked at yourself? l can't stand looking at you waste away. That's enough! Mom, we've talked about that already. lt's my decision. lf you can't give up these damn treatments, l'll make you. This is the way l choose to heal. Those doctors can't understand. All they can do is pump you full of chemicals! - You know you don't need that. - Stop it! l told you l don't want to hear it. Why are you doing this? Are you ashamed of us? ls your boyfriend putting ideas in your head? Leave him alone, okay? lt's got nothing to do with him! After all, yes, it's got everything to do with him! l want to live a normal life, with a normal guy. Do you want to suffer? Okay. But l won't let you die. We'll save you against your will if need be. Hi, there. How are you? - Do you recognize me? - Yes. l was scared l missed you. - How did you know l was here? - l saw you eaves dropping. - l wasn't eaves dropping. - Don't worry, l won't tell my mom. - l just wanted to talk. - What is it you want? - Excuse me. - lt's all right. l do get bitchy now and then. But l'm not stupid. Did you really think l wouldn't recognize you? Does your sister know what you do for a living? What's your problem? We both know you got nothing against whores. - l don't want to talk to you. - Do you think your friend, that hot Black dude, do you think he remembers me too? l remember him. Just thinking of him gets me hot. - Can you feel how hot l am? - Cut it out! What's going on? You don't like me anymore? You liked me better with red hair? - Do redheads make you horny? - Marquise, stop it! What Claire does, l do even better. What she won't do, l'll do. You don't love Claire, Thierry. You're only lusting for her, the same way you're lusting for me. There are lots of things you'd like to do with me. You like that, huh? Yeah, you do like it. Do you want me? l don't want you. And Claire doesn't need you. We don't want to see any more of you, get it? You or that colored guy. l'm warning you. lf l see Henri again, l'll fuck him so hard he'll never recover. ln the meantime, l'd love to eat you up, but visiting hours are ending. l've got to go see my sister. You're nuts! You're just sick! Say hi to Henri for me. - Why didn't you tell me earlier? - l couldn't tell if it was her. - l couldn't believe it. - Even so, you could have told me. - Do you know she tried to kill me? - l know, she's dangerous. She's on speed or some shit. l don't know what she's on, but she threw me around like nothing. l know, but next time we won't be as lucky. There won't be a next time. We have to stay away from that nut. - l don't like this at all. - l had to tell you, that's all. l have a bad feeling about this, and that usually means trouble. You know where Claire's family lives? - ln Longueuil. - Have you been there? - No. - Never dropped her off once? You don't know her mother. - How about Claire's apartment? - Yes. You've been there? You have a key? Never been there and l don't have a key. Stay here. - What are you doing? - Someone's picking us up. - Who is? - You'll see. lf you're planning to go to Claire's, forget it. What's wrong? Scared you'll learn something? We agreed we wouldn't tell anyone. lt's a different story now. lt's the same story. Nothing's changed. Everything's changed! That whore wasn't supposed to reappear! - Now l need to know why. - There's nothing to know. She's a psychopath. lt has nothing to do with Claire. Her sister tried to slit my throat! Come back to earth, won't you? - What's the address? - l don't know exactly. - But you know where it's at? - lt's here, but l don't have a key. - l have a key. - Are you nuts? - The neighbors will call the cops. - With that storm, no one's out. - l'll pay for a new lock, okay? - No. We'll get in deeper shit. All right, stay in the car. We're going. - We can't make a mess. - That's okay. - Are we done? - Where's the piano? - What piano? - Henri said she's a pianist. - So, where's the piano? - No piano, no musical scores, no CDs. - lsn't she a musician? - She's just moved in. - Are you sure it's the right apartment? - lt's the right apartment. What are you doing? Nobody sleeps in this bed. Claire's been in the hospital for three weeks. l mean, no one's ever slept in this bed. No tampons, no makeup, no deodorant. She took everything with her. Come on, this apartment's empty. No one lives here. What are you getting at? Maybe you don't know anything about your girlfriend. - There has to be an explanation. - Of course there is one. Your girlfriend's never lived here. - lt's a front. - She may drop by occasionally, but it's certainly not her primary residence. - Let's get out of here. - What? Let's go! Let's get out of here. Come on, let's go. Fuck! - What's wrong? - Fuck! - Let's go! Get in the car! - We won't go very far. - We should go. - Was that your girlfriend? No. That was her sister. We've killed her. She deserved it. Did you see her eyes? - l don't see her. - Come back in, Thierry! l don't see her. Come on! Your girlfriend left earlier. Her mother picked her up. l don't get it. ls her treatment finished? Not according to her file. Why release her if her treatment's not completed? She's declined any further treatment. We can't keep people here against their will. - Did Dr. Gagnon give his approval? - He probably doesn't even know. l can't believe this. Give me your number, he may call you tomorrow. l want her mother's number. - Whose mother? - Claire's. - No, no. - You don't understand. Her mother's nuts. She doesn't believe in cancer. She'd rather let her die at home than keep her in the hospital. - l didn't give it to you. - Thanks. The number you've dialed has been disconnected-- SUCCUBl l went to the hospital. Claire's gone. We're in deep shit. - We have to face the facts. - What do you think the facts are? The police will find Marquise's body and your aunt's car with the busted tires. - They'll make the-- - Wait a minute. Marie-Pierre's friends came to pick up the car. And did you read anything about a dead girl in the paper? She's not dead anyway. Those creatures are tough as hell. - ''Creatures.'' - lf you'd listened to me. l did, and look where we're at now. l saw her, man. Claire. l saw her eat what was in your condom. What? Admit it makes you wonder. No... l don't believe you. You know what zombification is? Those girls are succubi. They drink sperm and blood. You don't know anything about anything. You think just because you've never seen zombies, they don't exist. Magic, spirits and succubi are just like poverty and racism : ignore them and they'll disappear! What about her cancer? Claire's got cancer. l heard Dr. Gagnon tell her. And so what? - Succubi get cancer? - Why not? What a load of crap. You're full of crap. They performed a zillion tests on her. - Why wouldn't anyone see anything? - You said she was in the hospital - because her results were abnormal. - l'm through with this. Hold on. Can we stop arguing? l don't care if you believe me or not. Marquise isn't dead, and you need to help me find her before she finds me first. lf you're looking for a partner for your witch hunt, ask your aunt. You two make a great team. Joke all you want. You're her sister's boyfriend, and that nutcase is after me. At every corner, l wonder if l'm going to get stabbed. She's your girl's sister. You could help me here! Where is Claire, huh? With her mother? Just tell me where. You don't have to come with me. l told you l don't know. And even if l knew, l wouldn't tell you. - Hi, Frank. - Hi. How are you? l've come to pick up my aunt's car. - You got the keys? - Right behind you. Hi. - How are you? - Good. And you? - l was just about to roll a fatty. - Sorry, l'm in a hurry. - You got my stuff? - What do you think? You leave that sitting there? You couldn't hide it under your mattress, like everybody else? Have you come here to give me a lecture or to buy something? You got a bag or something? You have reached Henri and Thierry. We're not here and we don't care what you have to say. Thanks! Thierry, this is Claire. Claire? Claire, it's me. Where are you? Why aren't you in the hospital? Claire, listen. Promise me you'll listen. Are you at your mother's? ls it because of what happened to Marquise? How is she? Will she be all right? Claire? Claire, don't hang up. l know you're still there. lt can't end like this. Why are you saying that? l thought we were getting along. l know that. But why? You can tell me anything. Claire? l've made coffee and we have croissants. l spoke to Claire. She doesn't want to see me anymore. That's all she said. She didn't say where she was. She was right. lt was crazy. Until she came along, we had it pretty good. lt was just us. Yeah, we're buddies. She didn't have the right to turn my life upside down. She did warn me, mind you, but l didn't listen. Last night, l almost wished her dead-- Claire, and Marquise too. l wanted them dead so we could move on. The voicemail you've reached is full-- Do you recognize me? - You're Claire's sister. - Come with me, will you? - ls she all right? - No, she's not well. She really isn't. Hello? ls anybody home? Dr. Gagnon? Henri, is everything okay? Mom? Marquise? That makes things more complicated. - l didn't touch anything. - l told you not to do anything. You were supposed to go home like nothing happened. - What part of that don't you understand? - l couldn't wait and see. l know Marquise. She did that to me. Why all the lies? She's... a prostitute. A prostitute you paid to sleep with? Thierry and l went to a hotel with two escorts, just to see. There you go! Once again, you didn't think. Now we're all in deep shit. How was l to know she wanted to drink my blood? What do l know about succubi? Look at her. What are you doing here? Why did you bring him here? - She's letting herself die. - She should have stayed in the hospital. - She's got cancer. - l know that! What am l supposed to do? l'm no doctor. You're the only one who can convince her to get help. Leave me alone. l don't need you here. - l'm taking you to the hospital. - Don't you see it's not pills she needs? - You don't get it, huh? - lsabel! l'll make you understand. lsabel, stop it! ls there a manual for these things? lnstructions for killing succubi? Henri, you're not killing anyone. You and your great ideas. Why is she after me? What did l do? - You are black, Henri. - They're bigots, too? No, think about it. They feed on humans and a black person... ls more human than a white person. You know what this is? lsabel, stop it! What are you doing? l'm sorry, but he needs to understand what's going on. l think he gets it. Really? lsabel, please. - lf you get it, you know what this is? - Stop harassing him! l want him to say it. l want to hear you say it! lt's human flesh. lt's man meat. lt's Dr. Gagnon. Recognize him? Claire will have to eat him if she wants to get better. Come on, hurry. That's enough. You have to go. See, doctors are of greater help here than at the hospital. - You'd have eaten me. - Don't say such horrific things. - l'm saying horrific things? - l couldn't eat a human being! Does the lion hesitate before eating a gazelle? lt's not the same. A lion wouldn't eat another lion. Yes, but you're not human. What are you exactly? l don't know what's true anymore. Thierry? Sandra? - What are you doing here? - Who's Sandra? Nobody's ever told you guns were dangerous? This is my preferred weapon. When you use it right, it gets pretty bloody. l just want it to bleed. Oh really? We don't know what we are. We're a mutation of the race. Sort of a new version of humanity. All we know is we only have daughters. We need a human male to reproduce... and if we eat their meat, our system gains limitless strength. l want you so much. You hadn't forgotten about me either, huh? You want me too. Hurry up, Marquise. We got to go. Did you hear that? l've got to go. Mommy's calling me. You're parasites on humanity. We're no parasites. We're a new species. What's humanity anyway? Some kind of monkey with an overgrown brain who eats everything in sight and who reproduces more than the earth can sustain. Okay, lsabel. You scorn us, but you depend on us. Until a male is born. Then you won't need humanity anymore. Then we will be humanity. Look! That's Mom's car. What is she doing here? - What are you doing here? - No, what are you doing here? - Where are they? - Who? Mrs. Janvier? - ls Marie-Pierre here? - ln the kitchen. Henri? Marquise is almost done. l'll be waiting in the car. - Get out of here. - Mind your own business. Let go of him and get out! l've had it with you! When l talk to you, you listen. Get off of me! Do you want me to kill you? l swear l could! Claire had said not to touch him. Couldn't you help yourself for once? lt's none of your business. - Mommy! - Shut up or you'll get another one! lt's easy for you to talk, you didn't even taste him. - Don't act like you don't understand. - We can't go on like this. lt's not smart. We can't just go kill people in their own homes. We've got to be more careful. We can't draw attention to us, or we'll have to leave again. We need to stand by certain rules, and l'm sincerely sorry to say we can't revise your grade. l know. Nobody understands. The memories were haunting me. l had to leave the apartment. No, l'll leave right away. l don't know. All summer, for sure. l'll be traveling in the US. l'll be hard to reach so l'll call, okay? Don't worry, l'll be back in school in September. lt's not that. l just can't go back. Yes, me too. l'm hanging up now. Yes. Say hi to Dad. l'm hanging up. Okay? Bye. Mr. Lefrancois? This will be cold. ln spite of how tempting it is... all the sugar and caffeine in this drink aren't too good for the baby. lt's important to feed it correctly. We're getting a picture. Do you want to know the sex? Thierry, you decide. No, let's keep it a surprise.
