Let them try. I'd say: "Leave my Alyosha be. " I'd cover you like this and the bullets'd hit me. Can't you see what kind of people they are? You smoke too much. The right time to think about health. Money, money... I got to get it. I'll talk to them, they'll understand. No! Aren't you scared at all? I'm not. I bet we'll split our sides recalling how we feared going out. Written by Yuri KOROTKOV Valery TODOROVSKY Based on Renata LITVINOVA's story "To Have and Belong" Director of Photography Yuri SHAIGARDANOV, A.R.K.O. Production Designer Sergei IVANOV Music by Alexei AIGUI Directed by Valery TODOROVSKY Produced by Sergei LIVNEV You got friends while you're okay. Whenever you're in the lurch they leave you in a void. Still you've got the money. I mean I borrowed it. I tried to reach you on the phone. Your line was either engaged or dead. So I went out. Very stupid of me. I'd have left it at home. I was mugged at the entrance hall. Two hoods punched me and took all. Money, passport... Take it easy. Don't I deserve human treatment you think? No human treatment for you. Let me explain. I've found a buyer for my apartment. Let's go see him. I promised to come alone. He'll smell a rat and cop out. I've waited two months, I can wait two hours. Thanks. The girl stays with us. That is if you don't mind. She's not involved. Maybe not. But you'll be back soon, won't you. Sure. I'll be right back. Look, Alyosha has no money at the moment but he'll pay you back. I know he will. Wait here. This is not a brothel, honey. I've been told not to ever deal with you. But no. I tried to help the poor gal and here you are. Now grab your toys and get lost. And never set foot here anymore. Excuse me, where's the exit here? What's that stare for? I was wondering where the exit is. You're in danger? The danger's from men. I hate men! Thank you. You've helped me out. Too bad. Lots of paint. Left it all down there. Hold it. You're pretty, you look like an actress. Oh! That's something! Men must be crazy about you. Crying, begging favors on their knees. And you stand like a rock, proud and forbidding. No, not really. One guy came... looked at me. Handsome and rich. Expensive coat, car... Said: "I love you. I'll give you all I have. " I said no. I was, like, forbidding and proud. He cried and entreated. He killed himself. Oh no! - You saw anybody? - Nope. Stabbed himself. Are you deaf and mute? I'm mute. Look, I'm Rita. And you? Why ask? I'm mute. I can't answer. I'm sorry. I was scared stiff. Can you hear me speak? Sure. I'm not mute, I'm deaf. 85% deaf. I can hear at times but not like you. Sounds like the sea. Must be nice to always hear the sea. I'd rather listen to the door banging for a change. I'm bored with the sea. An unusual name, Yaya. Isn't it? My own idea. Said easily. The dorm. Turned me out. My shoes. Shoes. You pinched them. Of course not. You did. There's no one but you here. Give'em back. Not bad. You're a whore. Let's go. You're gonna sweat at a factory all your life. And I'll be happy and rich. Who's prettier me or she? You of course. Let's go to the sculpteur's. Good pad. She'll be wearing my shoes now. Let her. They'll hurt her. She has the man's feet. I lied to you. I'm totally deaf and she's half-deaf. Not a soul knows this place. Swear you won't tell anybody. What do you say? It's okay. I stood like this 5 days on end. Stripped to the skin. The sculpteur never got near me. He's nuts really. All he thinks of is work. Dressed like a bum. He's off at the monastery. Gave me the key. Said: "Come whenever you like. " Prays. Why? There's enough of everything. "Just you. No visitors. " You promised, remember? Mireille. I'll laugh different ways. You tell me what's the best. Why don't you just smile? I'd look sad like you. What's your problem? I need money. Lots of it. Money. Poor Alyosha. I'm sitting here drinking champagne and he must be looking for me everywhere. Forget him. He ducked you. You don't know him. He's trusting like a child. Bad people always take advantage of him. Okay, I'll spill the beans. I danced there three months. One guy came every single day. Saw me home, wooed me. Then told my boss about it. I hate all men, they are so mean. Think about Number One. Look after Number One. I thought he'd killed himself. Who? That guy. I lied. Why? I wanted a beautiful story. I know where to get money. You get it from men. Trust me. I've done that. Twice. I put it to good use. I bought those shoes with the men's money. We're both cute. You're pale, I'm swarthy. Lots of money, lots of happiness. Let's have some sleep. You know me. I'm looking for Alyosha. He's your friend, isn't he. Where is he? Oh, you're afraid. I'll be following you until you answer me. Tell me where he is. Please, have mercy. I've got to see him. Is he okay? I'm trying to get the money. If you see him by any chance will you please give him my phone number. I beg you. - I'm hungry. - No money. I haven't had a morsel. We'll have our fill, now. It's not right. - Why is that? - It just isn't. It's not right to starve. Not right to have no money. Maybe your boy'll bring us something to eat. Absolutely not. Leave it all to me. Just keep smiling. Your smile is dearer than their lousy food. I can't walk. I'm going to lie right here and sleep. I'm overstuffed. Love... Love... We gotta show ourselves to advantage. No liquor of course. We don't want to look silly. We should pretend we have doubts. But why? You don't understand. It's my status among the deaf. Your world will never find out. Deaf people are different. They are so blabbing. Pimps used to seek my company but I said I'm no whore. I thought you'd tried it twice. Yeah, twice. Heaps of dough. Very beautiful. What? Thinking about him again? Look at me. Come here. I've heard a story about a whore whose ears were cut off. It was money if I remember right. God forbid my ears be cut off. Deaf and earless-horrors! I'm done for! What? You cheated? No way. Nothing'll happen. Wave, wave. Strictly business. First, we supply clients. Second we provide security. Third, our wheels. Right. What are the rates? We take 60%, you take 40%. Okay? Look here. We get 70%. We're gonna provide for you. That's hard work. Indeed! It's the money that does the trick. It's we who work. We get 70%. Nice girls. Let'em have it. Stay out of this, you asshole. I'm nobody's fool, I got brains. They're mean. All of them. Let's quit. No deal. Come on, fume! We respect ourselves. We're off. Oh, we want money so much! Why the hell did you leave? I hoped they'd stop us. Rita, this is Hog. He's an authority. He owns a restaurant and a discotheque to boot. She can hear alright but she's as good as deaf. She's so starry-eyed, reads books plus washes herself! I... can't read. Only the bills of fare. Poor schooling. The teachers were afraid of us. I want to see you naked. Lay off. I picked her up. I saw her first. I'm the boss here. - Sure. - She's mine. She's a whore. I love whores. They're straight. I pay my money and I don't have to be brainy or handsome. She comes and does at my bidding. And she's not hurt. She takes the money and that's that. Other girls talk about feelings but mean money. What's so funny? So you can't do it for the fun of it. You have to pay to unwind. Sure. You got to be somebody with other women. You pay them whores and they'll love you be you a crass fool. What's she talking about? What will you be like with me? Witty or dull? How are you going to do it? Yell or what? Hey, why bother? It's business. Pay and go ahead. So you fear I may not like you? Okay. Money upfront! What are you talking about? Where's the book? I wanna signreceipt of the money. Pure soul. You're not a whore. Why are you here? Money. How much? A lot. How much? A great lot. Put it down. No man'd pay that much for this. I should lie 130 times like a log... No way. I'm a poor lay. I'm sorry. You want to be my girl? You'll have everything. Lots of dough. Lots of happiness. I'm sorry, no. I had a wife. Good and cute. Car accident. I'm really sorry. Leave! Leave! Get up. Stop it, Yaya. I lied to you. It was my first time too. I couldn't bring myself to do it alone. I'll tell you about my dream. Nobody knows about it. When I have lots of money I'll go to the country of the deaf. And where is that? It's a big island. Sea. Palm-trees, white mountains, sun. Warm the year round. People are happy. Kind and smiling. No need to think about money. Money is always around. Wherefrom? Deaf folks just get it. No problem. Where is that country? Very far. Expensive tickets. You get the address. I can't. I'm deaf. You'll help me. I could take you there if you like. But I can hear. I'll teach you to speak with hands. No one will know you can hear. I need you. You're lucky. We're going to the country of the deaf. Deal? Hi. Here. To fortify you. No, thanks. You'll become weak and ugly. Did Hog give you any money? I don't know. How come? May I? There! Some day we'll have plenty of money. We're gonna save heaps of money. You should stash it away, No. I'll keep it in the hand bag. He can call any minute. Who? Alyosha. So it's for him? Of course. Come on! You earned it! And he left you. It's yours. Give it back. This money... We'll live in paradise. Paradise? Bullshit! He may be killed anytime. Give it back! I love him. You're not coming to the country of the deaf! Hello! I'm speaking for Yaya. She has a message for you. What do I say? That's her? Yes. I hate you. Walk out of my life! Yes. Speaking. Yaya won't come today. Never! Never! I'm speaking for your friend Yaya. She see never! She never wants to see you again. Where am I? In Moscow. Where the earth is revolving. Round. The earth? Oh, the globe! The globe on the roof? Please forgive me. Take me to the country of the deaf. You're not going to leave me here? Let's not delay it. We'll start packing tomorrow. We don't have enough money. Yeah, it won't buy us the tickets. We'll see other problems. It's always summer there. The sea, palm-trees. And we don't have swimming suits. We'll get us the cutest suits and be the cutest girls at the seaside. You're swarthy, I'm pale. Is it scary to fly by plane? Not at all. I love it. I always feel sorry when we land. Where were you? Out taking a walk. It's dangerous. Promise you'll never go out alone in this city. - Enemies everywhere. - What enemies? You know it's a dangerous city. Can't trust anyone. I can't live within four walls. You're thinking about him again. And he's having fun without you. Eat this. What for? To look pretty. What for? To be loved. What for? To be alive! How they looked at us! Yeah. We are the cutest girls here. They are too shy to approach us. They think we're lesbians. I had a friend. We shared the bed with her. We cried when we were parting. - Why did you part? - The summer was over. - When was that? - Years ago. I was ten. I didn't have a good friend like your. Girls shared beds at our boarding school 'cos we were cold. So we are lesbians, huh? Horrors! One day I took my wife to some, eh, bad place. Lots of enemies. Talking behind her back. Reckoned she was deaf. But she heard it all. She gave me a signal and saved my life. Deaf folks liked her. She was my... ears. A toast? To honest women! Oh, what a toast! I don't have a wife now. No one can save my life. I wonder I'm alive at all. Life is dangerous. I need the ears. You'll be my ears. You don't have to hear all. Just important things. You'd be 100% deaf. But I am not deaf. I can hear. You hear millions of useless sounds. If I could hear everything I'd go crazy. But there are times when I need to hear just one word, and I can't. I need your ears. They should think you're deaf. You'll hear the right word and let me know. She knows the sign language. No, I don't. I need ears. You need money. Take your time. Think about it. I don't like freaks. I like things beautiful. What do you hear? All sorts of sounds. Cars riding, people talking and laughing. The woman that has just passed. She has metal heels. Music is playing in that car. That's of no use to you. The sound is void. There's nothing. Just the sea. Alyosha's on the boat. Who's speaking? - He's in the engine-room. - Is he okay? I can't speak. Alyosha, can you hear me? Are you okay? He's ugly. We should love handsome men. He's a bad boy. He'll always be in trouble. He must go. Where? He doesn't have a place to go. I want to live. I don't want to die. They won't come for him. Okay. We'll leave when he's better. No. Just him. No. You don't belong here. I don't like you. I'm Yaya. You are Alyosha? You are going to stay long with us? You look smashing. I do? We have some work tonight. Got to earn money you see. Some day we're gonna have a lot of money so we can have fun and do nothing. We are bosom friends. We share everything. We're very much alike. When she goes out for a minute I feel bad. The same with her. We are like sisters. - You work. - It's a strange story. She'll work with her earies. - How's that? - She'll be deaf. Not for long. When there's danger touch your earing. And I'll know. Okay? Sure. Rita, tell him. Lay off. - You promised. - Say no more. See ya. It's not that easy for a girl to live on her own. She needs food, she needs good shoes... Get yourself whatever you need. You should look great. There'll be more. Is this jazz? You work tomorrow? Can you tell me what you do. I will, later. Can't they hear anything at all? Hey, what does it mean to work as the deaf. You hear what you need and don't hear what you needn't. Talk to me. Say something. Like what? You have a nice voice. Er... Have you always been, I mean... Ten years old. I lost hearing after my step-father had beaten me. I remember all sounds but I can't hear them. Teach me in your language. Why? I feel a perfect ass when you "talk" to Rita. Just simple words. Tea. Tea. Thanks. - Sleep. - Sleep. It's like a game. Hey, let's play some game. Play some game? What game? Well, chess. I can't play chess. - Can you word guessing? - No. What game do you know? I know twenty-first on a-fingers. - Black jack? - Yeah, twenty-first. I don't have no money. We didn't use money at the boarding-school. The loser takes off one thing. - You played for undressing? - Taking off. And no backing off. The stake? You. Hog, that you? You bet it's Hog. Mao. Nuna. Pardon me, what's the girl's name? She's my woman. Cool it. Them freaks can be real jealous. You got the dough? You got the stuff? Show him. It's for you. He says it's not enough. He wants more. They don't trust us. Gimme more. Here's the whole lot. I want to see the bread. One, two, three. Repeat. Enough. To me. Cut. To me. - How much? - It's okay. Let him see the whole lot. It's on thwe plane. It's a shame we haven't screwed the gal. You don't trust me. But I trust you. A draw? Of course not. Then what? I'll make a wish. One, two, three. Move it, move it. You're right. We shouldn't have done it. I'm sorry. You need money? Here's some. You leave. Now. You don't want to stay here. Don't dally. Do it. No. I got to see Rita. No Rita. She comes and you are gone. Far. Nobody knows where. Rita's not happy with you. Rita doesn't need you. Your lives don't cross. Leave. I'm not going. I'll wait for Rita here. Then I'll decide what to do. Is that clear? Fine. I'll tell Rita what happened. She'll know what kind of man you are. Nothing actually happened. Somebody tried to drag me into bed. I felt awkward. I didn't want to hurt her feelings. But I did hold out. You don't like me? Well, Rita loves me. You'll never understand how she could love a man like me. You think she's not happy with me. Don't you think there are matters your deaf wits will never fathom? Hey, girl in love! He no good. He worthless. It beats me. What'd you find in him? Why, Yaya? Remember what I said about men? You didn't believe me. I proved it. Now you know. Any woman will do. He's not worthy of you. Leave him. Why lie to me? Lie? Never was a lie. You said we go to the country of the deaf. You lie. What did you tell her? Everything! The truth! You're mean. He deceived you. He let you down. I'm bad, he's good. It's unfair. You are wicked and cruel. You love nobody. You're selfish. I want to hear no more. But I love you! You not drop me. We're gonna be happy in the country of the deaf. No. This will never be. I don't want your country of the deaf. Because there is no such country! I go, you stay. Rita, you've come to like this deaf mute. But you can't nurse her all your life! Besides, she's very sick. You are going to cry. But it'll be too late. If you've nothing to say I'll go. What's wrong? You used to jabber without letup. No. Money. Now. You want me to punish him. Yes, he's mean. It's all unfair. Address! Yes, of course. No! Rita's there. No! Rita's good. Don't do... to Rita. Bad. Rita's good. Accidentally... no... don't. I won't. Keep the money. They come, you give it to them. Why don't they come? You hear me? Yes. Give me 50 bucks. Give me 50 bucks. You said I shouldn't give you money. Don't take it literally. They'll come any minute. We'll give them all the money. That's why we are here. Can't we take a glass of juice? This is my day. I've missed you. Sit by my side. I'll just change it and be right back. Give me 100 bucks. Let's go. We'll say we missed them. And see them some other day. You like to humiliate me. Come on, say it's your money. Wipe your feet on me. I can take it. Give it to me. I won't ask where the money comes from. I love you. We'll be fine. I said not to give me money. Leave me. I'm done for. Just leave me. That's my fault. Forgive me. I love you. Stop clowning. I'm not deaf. My God! I made you... And you've apologized for this. You are crazy. No, you are a saint. But I am an ordinary man. Beside you I feel bloody worthless every second. And you'll always look at me lovingly and not say a word of reproach. I'll be burdened with a sense of enormous guilt and you'll get pleasure from it. For you like it, don't you. But I am not going to give you this pleasure, okay? I belong to the people like myself. Please don't love me and don't try to save me. I live the way I like. And I have fun. So leave me alone! He is not in. He is gone. I don't know where. I want the money. I don't have it. After one hour I'll cut off her ear. And the other one after another hour. I need to see one man. He'll give me the money. You've come. Come over here. What brings you here? You want something? I want money. Pity you've come for money. I have no one to turn to. If I don't get it they'll kill Yaya, then me. He understand the human tongue? Shut up. Stay out of this. She's my woman!
