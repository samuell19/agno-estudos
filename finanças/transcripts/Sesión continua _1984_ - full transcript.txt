Double Feature Written by: JL Garci & Horacio Valcarcel. Produced and directed by: Jose Luis Garci. Dedicated to them. My love... I love you. And I need you I spend all day thinking about you. Hundreds of times I pick up the phone, dial your direct number and... and I hang up before it sounds. When I watch a program on TV, I tell myself: "Is he watching it? Did he felt the same thing as me when they say such things? " I love you so much, my love, that when I do something silly, I say to myself: "My God, if he knew." Go on, honey. I know that you are not one of those who can lead a double life for a long time. I know you, you are too honest, it would end up destroying you. And because of that, and because I don't want to break up your marriage... - I'm not breaking anything. You can't break something that has been broken for a long time. Marriages never break when they break, everything always comes from behind. Only routine...custom, or, in my case, a certain social convenience is what keeps them going. But now it's different. Now you're here. Sweetie... My love, my love, my love, I love you. I have to end it now, immediately. Not one more day. No, no, no, my love, you have to wait until a government crisis arises. My love, my love, don't be overwhelmed... Hey, enough with the "My love, my love, my love". - Why? - 'Cause no one talks like that, fuck. Why you talk like a 40-year-old woman, and not like a 20-year-old girl? You're wrong, girls in their 20's are like that. And say "my life", "my love", the one that doesn't is my wife. - OK, OK. Well... let's see, Federico, Sequence 24, Room: San Marcos' Hostel, Interior: night And less lyrical. You are a 22 year old girl, you're a Philosophy freshman. Men-ta-li-ze. The minister, the minister is in bed, eh? She has been crying in the bathroom so he wouldn't see her, and when he returns... he says: "What's wrong, are you okay?” Come on, go. Go. Come on. Let's leave it for today. To do something right, I need to be relaxed, comfortable and not dressed like some distinguished character. I'm also nervous, because I don't know at what time I'll get to the fucking wedding of the daughter of whoever. Look, it’s almost 6 and I still have to go get the car at the workshop. You don't know how lucky you are not to own a car. And I should go to La Confianza too. And Pili must be pissed already. She's havind a spell like that... Well tell Pili to be cool, after all she's not the one who marries. - Tomorrow at 11. - At 10. - At half past ten. Okay, at 10:30 but already showered eh? And understand already, Spielberg, Every time a married woman attends a wedding, It's as if she were getting remarried a little. Yeah right? But let me remind you, nuptials aside, that Balboa Films is biting his nails, because for the first time in his life he has paid half in advance, as it should be. Well, fuck him. - OK, OK, OK. And I warn you, Mr. Vencex, that we've been at it for four months and have only 30 sheets. And we don't have the title. Come on, have some guts and don't go to that wedding, we can finish the 24. And why don't you do that, and come with me to the cocktail ah? We can face together the poisoned canapé and while we talk: Euro building, amber room. No, no, no, I pass on weddings, christenings, funerals, communions, all of that gives you cancer. One of the reasons for my separation with Maruja was because I always refused to go to any kind of social celebration. - Hey, you can't ever win here. - Never. And don't think I did it on a whim, it's that I got pimples on my groin and in the armpits every time I went to such events. A psychiatrist friend told me: "ceremonial allergy". The root of everything, according to him, was here, in my German ass. He wanted to cure me, but I told him to take a hike, that my brain is untouchable, since it's what feeds me. Okay, right? Eh? How about this? Passable. What sort of things does my boyfriend has. - It's going to be our best movie. - Yes my love. Beware of those with mayonnaise. Have you already told the story to your father? Yes, darling. Well, get going, you get to the cocktail, and say: "Hello, Pili" and you chat with everyone except me. As if I were a widow. The same as if I were a widow. I'm a widow. Don't fight with them anymore, I love your wrinkles. They belong to me, I've seen them born, they are part of my achievements. You don't even need to say it. Most carry your signature. If I could, I'd return them all to you. And I'd accept them without hesitation, my love. Wow, what's wrong? Have you met some girl who calls you my love and has grown in you? Move. Never say "my love" to your wife, she'll think that you are teasing her. Simply say: "You", "Hey", "eh!” The movie is a "love story", a love story between a man in his forties in perpetual recycling, and also minister, and a 20 year old girl who is a Philosophy student. With less Shakespeare did "Romeo and Juliet". But it's very clear man, it's the fight between the postwar model carriage full of pending tasks, and the super young girl overflowing with withouts. Of what? Withouts. The generational abyss. OK, generational abyss. Anyways, I'm going to shit on my father. Listen to this, Varelita, and you too, Ionesco, What I want is a movie, do you understand? - OK, yeah. - A movie. - Yes, Yes. What is a movie, Matias? Tell that to them. - It's a love story, Don Dionisio. - Aha. Where many things happen but at the end all ends up OK. Exactly. - Don't go, we have to talk. - Alright. Something entertaining where many things happen. Love, jealousy, hate, wrong weddings... Something that makes people have fun. And, at the end: "I love you so, Purita, I love you so much, Pepe". And that's cinema, and that's the way movies are. If they are so simple, why don't you write them? Because I don't have the time, smart ass, if I had the time... Cesareo told me that, many times. I'm already seeing it: "Balboíta, you with your imagination would make wonderful stories. " Excuse me, I have to use the bathroom. Happens every time, whenever we talk to him, the guy gets up and takes a piss. It's because we're a diuretic, they'll sell only in pharmacies. - And without prescription. - Yeah. So don't bring me one of those author's films full of people who just look around and nothing ever happens and if something happens, it happens very slowly. The public wants stories, not personal ironies. Fede, leave that trophee alone, I can see you through the mirror. Hey, how do you do it? - What? - Pissing without noise. I couldn't piss, not a drop. - Then it has to be prostate. - Of course. Well, the only important thing in a movie is to succeed on the main thing. What a funny guy, and what is the main thing? Hey, smart ass, if I only knew... If that was something known, Cinema would be done by banks. The Banesto, eh...eh... The Hispano, the... - The Zaragozano. - That one. But there's one thing that is very clear, and that Alfred Hitchcock and I say a lot: The spectator has to be seated in his chair as if he were on top of a time bomb. That's it, action, love, adventure, mystery... Cinema. So let's forget about the generational abysses. I have a son of 20. And my son does what I say and thinks what I think. Well, alright, it'll be the exception that confirms the abyss. Boat horn Hey, don't you have that thing too far away? Maybe it won't record. No, it doesn't have batteries, considering what they pay me. Besides, they edit everything I write. Then you leave the theater and start writing movies and television, and also novel. You win the Nadal with "Death of a telephone". Aha, yes. So what? You're also very shy, huh? Sorry, sorry. - Hey, Gorochenco, Gorochenco. - What's going on now? Well, I understand that you as the author are nervous, but try to understand me, With so many interruptions, we'll never finish this. Sorry man, it's not a small thing. It's okay, it's okay, chill, kid, chill. Che, stop, stop, you cunt, stop that, fuck it. Can't you hear? Everyone stop. Ah, speak, Epi, speak, speak. You see, it seems to me that the third ant should speak with her true voice and not force it. But, listen to me, kid, you, you have to bear in mind that it's an ant, Understand? Fuck, no one knows how ants talk, she's an actress dressed as a third ant, to me that they speak with ant voice seems like, I do not know, man... Also, let's see Gorochenco, where are the 30 ants, that should make sense of this scene? Here I only see eight. Oh, that to me...? Go ask production. Do you know what an ant charges for two daily functions? Hey? Voices on television We have to kill the minister. - How? - An attack. An attack? No, let's kidnap the minister. Let's see, go on, go on. It's a false kidnap. The minister has told his wife, that he is writing a bill in a place X. Then they call from the President’s office, it's urgent. She tells them where he is, but he's not there, 'cause he's where he is, I mean he's not there, he's with Pili. in another place, without listening to the radio or watching TV. In short, the minister vanishes. And the mess comes when the truth comes out, because then they have to deny the news of the kidnapping. A kidnap never ends a political career, but a love story, does. Very nice, very nice. It's evident that Mala has returned. Hey, I'm cold, this habit of yours of writing in the outdoors, It's fine in summer, but now... I'm starting to get chilblains. She's my daughter, isn't she? Solitude, Solitude. And what does that mean? The empty stalls? What, that the movie is going to be a failure? I don't watch your movie, that's less important. You're wrong, Mala, that's the most important thing to me. My life is cinema. You hold on to the movies because everything else scares you. ¿Wh... Where is she putting that one? On which card does she put it? You have to talk to Sonia. Why? Is something wrong? Talk to your daughter, if only once. Fu... ha! Thank God I don't want to believe in these things, else, it's really something to terrify you. It's all very clear. OK, it's very clear that the message is obscure. Everything is magic. On Thursday, next week they premiere "The return of the Jedi", I can get tickets for Sunday, So, are you in? -No. - Not for me, I'm leaving for the weekend. - Where? - Camping. - Where? - To the mountain. To Bustarviejo with some friends. Fine, so it's me and you going. I can't either Dad, it's Celia's birthday. OK. And who is Celia? A friend from school, she's my best friend. Well, whatever, we'll have to give the Jedi a shot in two months. - Aha. Please, sir, could you bring some cold milk? - What about your mother? - Mom? She's fine. What do you mean fine? She breathes? She watches TV? She's still jogging? Can't you be a little more explicit, my child? Dad, don't start. In other words, Mom OK and Dad OK and the girls, OK too. That's, fine because everyone's OK, then let's get bored for a while. Not a good time. Hello. Yes. Stanley Kubrick. Tell me. I'm slowly getting depressed. What? That I'm slowly getting depressed. So what? Are you drunk? A bit. Well, how about it? Do you like the title? Title? What title? The film's title: "I'm slowly getting depressed." The phrase that the minister tells to the girl in the 19th. "A terrible thing happens to me, it's that I'm slowly getting depressed." You no longer remember? Well, you like it or not? Well, on the one hand, not much. But on the other, neither. The one that's going to be excited by this is going to be Balboa Films. See you tomorrow. "I'm slowly getting depressed." It's very clear, dad, the thing is that I don't know how to tell stories. I haven't lived a story since, well... since I was ten years old and I kissed Marisa under water in Torrelodones. And that I've always lived in a movie state. I tell that to Fede every day: "Fede, we’ve dedicated our lives to John Ford, to Spencer Tracy, to the RKO and we fucked up. " Always paying attention to myths, to the movies, and we've forgotten to live our own lives. Yes, I know you always told me dad, don't be a jerk. That also happens to politicians, to doctors, to musicians, to priests... And that's why, we don't know how to tell stories. Because in our lives, there are no stories. In contrast, the John Fords and company loved life before the movies, that has been our mistake, to love cinema and not life. Fuck. It's indeed scary, come on. For us, life is in the 100 minutes that you spend in the living room. Because then, on the street, it's like if you were in a movie, who am I? Me, I'm Captain Blood, sailing alone and feeling the wind in the sails. Or, or you´re going to deny that I wasn't the fastest along with Johnny Guitar in northern Arizona? The problem now is that I wear glasses, I feel tired, I'm about to be shot by a blurry kid. I would have liked to live fast, as well. die young and to have a beautiful corpse. Like Nick Romano. But as you can see, "I'm slowly getting depressed." A scary movie. Written by José Manuel Varela and Federico Alcántara that isn't going to make a cent, Dad. How are you doing? Bad. Do you know what's a flashback, Pili? No. And what about Ávila? - I'm on it. - OK. Well, a flashback, Pili, is that you and I love each other a little. In other words, going back to the past. Typewriter It took me longer than expected, you must be bored, right? It's very nice in here. Look, I've told the superior that I've come with a friend and she gave me these sweets, they're for you. They make them. Those are delicious. Thank you! They're the ones who sing psalms. I like it. Everything is magic. And it's not playback, they do it live. ♫Chorus♫ Perdigero. Do you know that when his daughter got married he hired 100 extras from the union, half and half, he took them to Cornejos, put them in tuxedos, the gals in a long dress and made them sing Mozart's "Hallelujah"? - OK, OK. Haëndel's. - What? - That the "Hallelujah" is Haëndel's. - Well, what I said. Perdigero. Sumer told me recently, that he took a blood test and the results were J&B positive. Let's go to another country. With Perdiguero, you'll end up doing everything. He won't let the directors say action or cut, because the metre is lost. And what do they say? "Jip." They say "jip". They say, "jip" and it's a cut. But let's get back to our issue, What is that, when you talk about a girl with-out? Pili, the girl who hooked up with the minister, is an authentic "FM girl in". A woman on FM. Drinks canned soda, wears Calvin Klein jeans, reads poetry, is honest, she doesn't spend time with the video or the TV, and above all, pay attention, always live with-out: without bubbles, without alcohol, without caffeine... Our minister is tacky, but has become modern, his traumas have been left behind, phimosis, premature ejaculation, all aesthetic as you can see. He's one more of those 3 million Spanish men / Spanish women that have become modern. Jogging, golf, tennis, Valium, blunts on their days off, - Barely any rhythm... - Half a dozen credit cards. Watches that go: "Pi pi pi", "Pi pi pi pi", at the movies. The "Time" magazine, "Heavy Metal" type comics, and, above all, our tamed male has discovered the personal computer. On weekends, he goes out with the children and the dog to his old mill, that's been made decent with stereo sound, diverse videos and rugs from Isfahan in search of the lost trauma in his first computer. But that... it's modern, but it's not authentic. Sure! That's why the meeting of our gimp with the with-out girl is...eh Like Faust's with Marguerite, a commotion. That, that, of course! Understand that he hasn't lived, Balboa in spite of his almost 45 years. Because his whole life, he's been preparing to live. - Do you understand Balboa? - Where is my life? Where is my life? And that's the movie. The great movie. I have to tell him, and I don't know how. 25 years of a life together that are coming to an end. If you ask me, I feel even worse to tell Luisito. Because, how do you say that? Although I hope he understands that I'm still young to start a new life. Hey, Mom... I just can't get used to call you Mala. You have no idea how good it's been for me, to talk to you. I just had to tell someone. Can I ask you a question? Is it true that you can cure a nephritic colic, just by putting your hands on the kidney? Fede told me. Among other things. That's not the question you want to ask me. What you want to know is, if there's something between Jose and me. Hi. Um, it smells very good. How are you? - Sister Inés. - Hello. - My sister. - And... - Hi. - A friend. I just stumbled upon the word "universe", and I've discovered that it's false. But what's false, the word or the universe? No, no, all of it, all of it, all of it. The concept and the term. The universe doesn't exist, the multiverse does. Of course, of course, of course. Hey, let's rest for a little while, eh? Relax, Fede, relax, that this is just a movie. Each and every one of us... is a sensations' center. OK. Only... we only perceive what's in our wave, - in our frequency. - Ah. And why does that matter to you and me? In the scene in bed with the girl, the minister has just discovered... that. That there's a universe for each brain, that is, the multiverse. But I can't find a way for him to explain it simply. Let's see, Fede, In the bed scene, why don't they just stick to the: "Do you like it? Yes, a lot, a lot?" I'd even allow them to say a couple of times "my love, my love", and in the end, the usual: "Did you like it? Yes, a lot, a lot." But what are you thinking? A bed scene like the one everyone else films, - based on gasps? - No, fuck, but it isn't normal either having the dude reciting a Hamlet's monologue, fuck that. Fede, this isn't "The ants." The bed isn't the most suitable place to discover that the universe doesn't exist, I think, I don't know. - We have to insert the bus scene. - Which one? Have you seen people's faces when a bus passes in front of you? That 12 o'clock bus at night, half empty, they all go home, but wrapped in an almost magical sadness. That feeling, can only be given by cinema. And we also have to include the the savings bank coin's scene. Which one? When our minister came to study in Madrid and ran out of tobacco, he sat on a bench in Cibeles, and there he killed time watching how the little coin fell, tac, tac, tac. It's one of the first things he's going to tell the girl. Hey Fede, stop going to "The Ants" rehearsals. That Gorochenco is eating your brain. I'm talking seriously, we have to put some things like that, at least once. The main advantage of American Cinema, which we like so much, is that it doesn't tell stories, but fragments of stories. - But those... Where are you going? - To find you a bus. Damn, but those fragments give you the impression of following a complete story. Well, that's all. As... As we did with "The travelers", don't you remember? What's the best football you've ever seen? - Brazil's at Mexico's World Cup. - No. - Better was Madrid's in Glasgow. - You think? - Sure man. Fifth European Cup's finals, 7-3. A painter? - Eh... Picasso. - Goya. - A playwright? - Mmm... Arthur Miller. - A musician? - Mozart. - No, no, from cinema. - Ah, from cinema... - Eh... Mancini. - Aha. - Your best year? - 62. I premiered "The fence" in Bucharest, and my son was born, I had a hemorrhoids procedure, Oh, what a relief! - I can only imagine. - And my Atleti won the Recopa. - Your best year? - None. No, do not laugh, I mean it. You know something? When me and my wife split, we reached an agreement: "She stayed with everything." Ha, ha, that's Woody Allen's. Yeah, but what about this? about this? Let's see... Let's see, what's the difference between an orchestra and a quartet? " I don't know, what is it? Well, the orchestra is what comes out of Moscow and the quartet what comes back. - Hey, hey, that's a good one. - Well, it's mine, it's mine. - We have to put it in the script. - Sure. Thank you. Sonia, please. From a friend. She's my mother in law. Sonia. Hey, it's me dad. Yes. Can we see each other tomorrow to talk for a while? About camping. That guy, that you can see there, the diplodocus carnegii, was herbivorous. And how do you know that? Well, I've known about its family for a long time. That individual is a reptile dinosaur of the suborder of the auritians... Hey, tell me one thing, are you happy? Tell me a color, black or white aren't allowed eh. - Uh... blue. - Grey. - A novel? - Red harvest. No, can't you remember when you were a kid? Treasure Island. - No, and red harvest too. - Sure. A filmmaker, not from the usual ones? - Always Chaplin. - Always Lubitsch. - A woman? - A woman? How about three. - What are you saying? - Man, of course. - A country? - Spain. - A bandit? - Eh... John Dillinger. Why John Dillinger? - Because he was killed while leaving a cinema. - Oh, sure, of course. - A song? - Yesterday. A movie? and no, not from the usual lot. Almost all from when I was a kid, some as teen and almost none as of now. - What about you, a movie? - "As we were". It was a movie where two guys said each other: "Tell me a book, a year, a failure..." Booth laugh. You want to do it how? In black and white? And what's that? A coffee with a ball of ice cream? I need to do something about you two, huh? First the title: "I'm strongly getting depressed". "Slowly", "I'm slowly getting depressed". And when I have to sell it to the television, what should I do? Do I color it by hand? Come on, man, let's be serious. Balboa Films only makes films in color. The other type leave it to your friend Woody Allen. Well, I'm in a hurry, do you like the script or not? But which of them? Because there are three. No, it's just one script with three different endings. Fuck! Pay attention, Samuel Goldwyn's imitation, the movie is called "I'm slowly getting depressed", We're going to do it in black and white and I'm going to shoot three endings. But who do you think you are? - The neighborhood tough guys. - We are bakers. Just a moment, I need the bathroom. Hey, Vin Wenders, who's the one who understands about cinema around here? Me, naturally. You, and very little, understand about how to sell it. But with every passing day you're becoming more messed up, and critics are even starting to like you. - And that's the end. - Well, almost. Didn't you enjoyed going to Cannes to receive the prize of "The travelers". Dman, I should have been the one to get that. I'm in a rush, need to be at the theater in half an hour, in 5 minutes I'm out. Hey Ponti, how many movies have you done with me? - Too many. - Not, too many, six. Six, and have you lost money with any of them? No, right? So then? Because none was in black and white, none had three endings and above all, none was called "I'm strongly getting depressed". - "Slowly" "slowly..." - Play it again, Sam, fuck! Man! look: "the refreshment." I'm sure the planes of the bus and the coin are yours too. Because when you get the vein of the absurd, everyone needs to tremble. - So what? - Play it again, Sam, what? - "Casablanca". Did you piss? - Not a drop. Sure "Casablanca", I'm not that ignorant. Prostate. Had many endings and it seems that it was liked. It only had two. And yes, it's the prostate, what's wrong with that? Listen, Balboa Films, the best years of our life, that were the worst years of our life, or the other way around, as you wish, it's the same to me, we have them pinned to black and white movies. That's what happens to our minister. His childhood and youth are linked to black and white. The school in Vitoria, his first girlfriend, the pension on Silva Street, the five Real Madrid's cups, the NO-DO, everything was in black and white, that's why we'll tell his story like that, in grays and... leave me alone! We are in the 80s if I remember correctly, right? Well, for every movie we watch from the 80s, we watch five from the 40s on TV, We're watching more 40's cinema than in the 40's itself... - Don Dionisio... Get out! And what were movies like, at the time? Well, in black and white. Meaning that people, via TV, is heavily used to black and white. Balboa Films, really, it's not a pose, it's not a snobbish stance, I implore you, by your noble compassion, to let me film it like that. And about the ending, we'll see if the minister resigns and keeps the girl, or if he doesn't resign and leaves the girl, or if he resigns or doesn't, and the girl shows him the door. Alright. About going to film in Portugal, not a chance. No bungalow on Nazareth's beach. That means going back to San Marcos' Hostel. - Neither. - Oh no? But can I know what has the Guadarrama done to you? It is right here, he comes and goes in the day, half diet. That is, about exteriors, beach and sunset, nothing. Decoration: interior, night cabin and a good fireplace's fire. - And it's great like that. - Oh yeah? Oh, and the bed scene is also gone, I want kisses, kisses and not fucking, kisses like in yesterday's movies. It's because you're not up to date, people are now kissing more than ever, go to a park and see it yourself, we've returned to the "roundabout kiss". We are in a new era, a new neo-romanticism. Young girls in America barely fuck anymore, They want kisses, love, tenderness. In Spanish films you no longer kiss, you just fuck. Well, at Balboa Films, cinema productions, from now on we're back to the kiss. I want kisses in the foreground, face against face, lip against lip. - I guess you'll know how to do that. - I don't. I want high-precision kisses, as Melvin Le Roy and I say. What? Who's the modern one now, huh? Who's not up to date? Where have you read all that? - Nowhere, my son told me... - Who thinks what you think and who does what you do. Well yes, that, that. Well, I'm leaving. You accept the script, don't you? He-he-he. Yeah, man, yes, I accept it. Good, then you can go tell Mr. Ranseros to start making copies. - Tomorrow I'm coming for the check. - Hey... Can you tell me what's wrong with you that you're so turned off? Sadness "pos folium". As others feel the sadness "pos coitum", This guy gets it after he finishes a script, he feels like an... emptiness. - Ah, so he's slowly getting depressed. - Oh, he knows. Balboa Films, you're like a dry leaf that the wind drags from sewer to sewer. But I love you. - "Return to the past". - Jacques Tourneur. - 1947. - Black and white. No, no, thing is, that you're her grandfather and you try to excuse her. Well, I'm her father, you know? Her father, and I can't allow... Ah well that, that, that a shitty girl talks to me in that way, as if I were a stranger. You should have heard it. I've already called her four times and nothing. There's just no way. Good and what do you want me to do? Huh? To keep my arms crossed? Sonia is almost a girl. No, hey, hey, no. Not 20 years old, 19. She's my daughter and I love her, yes, I love her, even if it doesn't show. - Doorbell - ... I love her and I don't want to see her suffer But who the fuck can it be now? - I know she's nervous and scared, but that doesn't mean that... - Doorbell But she's scared not of her story, but that I'm aware of the mess, and we'll have to do something, right? - Hello. - Hello. Have you lost the key? I'm going to get some herbs and sleep, tomorrow I need to wake up early. - To Ávila again? - Aha. - Hey, why don't you use your broom? - I have it in the workshop. Look, I don't know what's happening in Avila, nor I care, but Fede is sad. - Do you want an infusion? - Sure, yes, but with a shot of anise. Well, dad, let's forget about the girl's matter eh? ... Let’s leave it, I have a lot to do and I'm tired. Besides... As much as we talk, you and me, it won't fix anything. In how many weeks are you going to make the movie? - Well, look, the work plan says eight. - Seven. This is in 7. The "Dir" lowers it to six and a half with reduced equipment, and the boss says nope, and he's right because this isn't Hollywood, that it can be done in five. - You know something? - Go ahead - It can be done in four. - Yes. - 3 while we're at it. We haven't even started to roll and you two are already driving me crazy. - Hey, Matias. - What is it now? Marisa's representative, he says no lower than 60, - and for 2 sessions it will be a 100. - Have you heard? - With a wig I can do better than her. - Ha-ha-ha. - Very good. - I already told you to go away man. Yes Boss. Tell him to forget it, and tomorrow, when he calls again, you close the two sessions for 75. Okay. Call Valero and hire the big crane for a week. - OK. - OK, OK, OK, no, Now! Then she's always busy doing advertising. And wise up Matias, cut the bullshit, that these are not "The metabolics", if any of these things fails, I won't film, I won't film! We're all going to take it in the ass. - Hello Dad. - Hello. What's up? What do you mean, what's up? Didn't you wanted to talk to me? But now I can't. Can't you see that I can't? Good, good. Whatever, see you later. - Hey... hey Sonia... - Whatever, man, whatever. I can tell that when you're working you don't exist for anyone. - Go ahead - How long for us to do it? - On whose behalf? - Huh? - Five weeks, - One moment - and a half with reduced equipment. - Matias, to the phone. - Who is it? Hey Jose, two things, and nothing else then I'm leaving. First: I want a script. Haven't they already given you a script? Hey, Manolo, a script for Federico. What is it Manolo? What is it? Has a scriptwriter no right to anything? - Fuck, you know Balboa has them all. - Well, ask him for one. He just left and he have them locked. You already know that. I'll be damned..., don't worry, you'll have your script. Word. It happened, it happened. Took a lot of work, what do you think? - The registration certificate... - Listen. Yes, yes, I mean we already have the circulation permit. - What? It's not? - Well, thank you very much, regards. Tell him to stick it up his ass. Will you? Stick it up your ass. That no one here performs, they go to a concert, asshole. Return it immediately, man. Can it be possible? - Are you coming to the premiere? - What premiere? Fuck. Hey, what are those kids doing there? What are those kids doing there? What are those kids doing there? - What are those kids doing there? - Oh, I don't know, the councilor brought them. Those aren't fucking kids? They are dwarfs. Let's see. Excuse me, please, if you're so kind, can you please leave? There's been a mistake, excuse me, huh? - Didn't looked right to me, there are no dwarves in the script, - No. - Well, are you coming to the premiere? - But what premiere? Ah, yes, "The Ants", I forgot. - So it's tonight, huh? - Aha. - Boy, do we have a mess now... I want to start rolling the 24th and we haven't located the exteriors yet. - Tomorrow you pick me up at 7, right? - Yes, I'll pick you up at home. - Well, don't worry... - Earlier, of course, earlier. -...earlier. - You'll see her another day. - What do you think? - I don't like it. You see, Jose... I don't like it... Huh? Listen to me, Jose, I would like you to take a look at the third ant, It's a girl that... - But why don't you like it? - Because I don't like it. The third ant is called Amelia - and is a girl who could do very well as Pili's sister. - Yes. Go ahead You're boning her, huh? Me? Buah, you know I'm a man that barely fucks. On whose behalf? Then for me, send her to me. Tell her to introduce herself as the third ant and I'd know what's up. - Jose, to the phone. - Who is it? A guy about a conference that you have to give I don't know where. What I needed. And now what do I tell this guy? Hey Fede, why don't you give this talk for me, and get yourself some cash? - No, no, don't mess with me. - It's about the usual. - Yes, yes, you do it very well. I can't help you, leave me alone. Fede, it's going to be impossible for me to go to the theater, at 9 we have a meeting with the whole team. - It's at 9, right? - Yes at 9. Yeah, it won't end until after 12 at least. How about... you come home later and we have a drink together? - Well we'll see. Bye. - Alright. - Pass me the call. - Of course. What are you doing there? Always stirring my papers. - Damn it. - Always bugging me, bothering me. - You're all crazy. Jose, there might be problems with the minister's BMW. - A SEAT won't do, right? - No, I rather use a motorcycle. A bike, a bike, so the minister can take the girl to the mountains. A bike! A bike! A bike! Let's see, go ahead. No, I'm not Don Matias, I'm Don Matias’s mother! Whistles and protests And it will be a new, different day, as the first day of creation. And we'll recognize it, because on that day the light of freedom, will illuminate all the anthills. Poor guy, he's fallen asleep. And this isn't a good time, I already warned Fede. But you've seen it already, when he get something in his head... And the dwarves? What are those dwarves doing there? - And Fede? Where is Fede? - He's parking. Your parking space is occupied by a car... a small one, emerald green, very beautiful. Ah yes, that asshole on the ninth-left letter D. Hey, that asshole that from the ninth-left letter D has left his shit fig of a car again In your garage, you have to tell him something, right? I know, it won't happen again. Go make yourself comfortable, that the piper is getting warm. The piper? Why? Is there something to celebrate? What happened? Did they suspended the premiere? Unfortunately not. Starting the second act, half the theater was gone. Well look, if the audience got bored tomorrow you'll have good reviews. I knew it, I knew it was going to be a disaster. But what can you expect from a guy who confuses irony with violence. He got the ants with biker helmets, the whole second part, with biker helmets. "Che, be calm, Federico. You have to get the catharsis to purify the mise en scene by means of a rebellious distancing performance. Son of a fucking bitch! - Fede! - Yes, son of a fucking bitch. "The debut of pure anguish theater, a dramaturgy of purification like that hairy ape..." Son of a fucking bitch! All of it... he took out the entire opening. When the curtain came up, you know, we should have the impression to be at the entrance of an anthill. Well, none of that. "And if... we'll divide the stage into two halves, the horror and... the horror, the earth below, the stone is the sky, above". Also the bastard wiped the entire end of the first part when the red ants fight with the blue ants to the delight of the colorless ants. Colorless ants? I haven't seen those. Did Gorochenco also wiped them? "But what you sayin'", Gorochenco wiped everything that came out of his ass. The colorless constitute the dominant race, those that whatever happens, always live well, because their bodies are transparent, and they adopt the same color of the ones that rule. - Right? Kind of... - Sure, sure, but he understood nothing, Well, with this montage no one understands. "Look, we'll get a greater impact than what the theater of cruelty got, we're going to Broadway, man" If we go to Broadway, they put us down with a bazooka. Look, it's not that I want to defend Gorochenco, you know that I hate him, but I've always told you that your play had a very difficult montage that it was practically unpresentable. Hey, difficult maybe, but not unpresentable at all. 20 years ago the crew of education and rest stealthily represented it in the mobile park and they did it very well. Remember what Marqueríe said. - No, I don't remember. - Well, that. "Well, che, come, come with me". "Help me to directly bring the cups, eh?” Leave it, Jose, don't bother, it's too late. I don't drink alcohol, it wakes me up. Ah good. Just a moment, a moment, a moment... Let's clarify this once and for all. Here we've come to have a drink with Jose, to celebrate the failure of "The Ants". That you don't want to have a drink with Jose? Well, you don't have it. If here, Sondra the mysterious, Queen of Shangri-La or whoever the fuck she is doesn't want to drink with Jose, well she just doesn't, but I'll have it, is that clear? I'll have a drink with Jose, because that's why we came. Or didn't we came for that? Hey? No, no, answer me! Why did we come here? Did or didn't we came just for that? - Hey, the failure has gone to your head. – No, no. Let her say it, let her, we've come to have a drink with Jose. Well, I'll have it. "Che be cool, Federico, it's going to be an exceptional premiere." Son of a bitch. That asshole Gorochenco says that he's been at the Moscow's theater... ... it might have been in Stalingrad... Although he'll never recognize it, "The Ants" is his favorite work. A work of his youth. He wrote it shortly after we met, it's dedicated to me. Problem is, that I had planned to present the issue today. But with all this, I don't know how to do it. Let a few days pass, if you tell him now, it will hurt him more. There's no way, Mala, there's no way. I've tried, I've talked to Sonia and nothing. It turned out to be fatal: "Dad, don't be a hypocrite". She told me that and it's over. I didn't knew what to answer. A father like me, has nothing to do. - Why? - Because she's right. I'm a father who sees her from time to time, that takes her to the movies, who asks her if she studies a lot. Just that much, what gives me the right to get into her life now? But it bothers me, because I love her. I love her very much, even if don't know how to tell her. There are people who do well, being friend to their friends, but not as a father, and that's me. And that's the thing. That she's going out with a guy around my age, and that in the best case, will complicate her life for a while. No. Why not? 'Cause that guy isn't like you imagine. Oh no? So what's that guy like? Mmmm... Sequence 34. "I know that I'm at a loss with you and that I'll always be, but not by age, it doesn't matter that I'm 42 and you're 20. I'm at a loss because I'll always need your good sense, Your sincerity, your emotional balance. You know, emotionally, I'm still a child. A child who's afraid of life." - Very nice, nice but... - But what? That it isn't true? That everything you write is a lie? Yes. No. Well... One thing is cinema and another, much more dangerous, is life. - Besides, my daughter isn't that girl in the script. - You sure? Sure. "I think I need you because in you I've found something that I've never felt around my family. My parents, my people, have always seen me in a different way to how I really am. I believe that as children we're never as we really are with our parents. A strange modesty prevents that, to them and to us. With you, on the other hand, I have the feeling that life is fine, That it's great to get ready to go and meet you, It's great to wait for a phone call from you, that is great, to go anywhere and think about you, listen to music and smile or get sad. Did you notice that our songs, Barbra Streisand, Serrat, Don't sound the same if we're not together?" What? It's long, that paragraph is long, I've already told Fede. If the world according to Varela-Alcántara doesn't work, It would be better if you don't start filming tomorrow. Why don't you talk to him? Because I don't know... I would know how to write my scene with him, but talk... I don't know. No... OK. Cafeteria, general plane. Camera frames Sonia's father, and it goes traveling with him to the table where the guy waits for him. Short plane of the guy, back plane of the father. Why don't you talk to him? I already have. And? He's a good person, divorced. Like me. - They have two children. - Like me. One of nine and the other is seven years old. And he loves Sonia, he really loves her, eh? No nonsense. But who's that guy? Where did she met him? In the faculty, he's Sonia's teacher. Economic Theory's Professor. Fuck, fuck. Hey, Jose, and a man as romantic as your father, What does he think about this? You already told him, right? Getting depressed, 49-3, second. Action! Traveling. Yes. Yes, who's calling? One moment, please. Girl, come here! - What? - Phone call. Who is it, grandma? He says it's a friend, but I think it's your father. Yes. Hi, dad. And what do we have to talk about? - Dad, the camping thing is my business. - Cut. Listen for once, that I won't repeat it again, I've known Mala for a long time, but I don't know who she is. I know she comes and goes, that she appears and disappears from Jose's life, that she has a very good influence on him, that she's a little weird, well, a little... But she's a very good person, you've seen it, I told him to go with you to Ávila and you saw. Come, let's get the chorizo, I don't know anything else. To me, all those things that keep you up at night, if he sleeps with her or doesn't, I couldn't care less. - No, no... that one. - Sure, it makes me sick. Jose has his life and I have mine. By the way, both are equally tasty. Anyways... Mala's father was a merchant sailor, a captain, - from Gijon. - Oh. And he was married here, but in Rio, in Rio de Janeiro, he broke his leg while drinking in the middle of the carnival and there he met a mestiza and begot in her a daughter during his convalescence. What do you think? Well, that lately you read too much of the Bible, because that of "and begot in her..." Well, the merchant sailor, Lived ever since with his heart divided in two, because he loved the Brazilian and her little girl with passion... - Hey, do we have lemon jam? - We do. - And pickles? - Yes. - Should I go on? - Yes, Yes. Well, the sailor also loved his Spanish wife, and his son, because they had a 15-year-old son. And that child was... your friend José Manuel Varela. That is, Jose and Mala are brothers of the same father. And Mala's name is Graciela dos Santos Varela Leiriña. - What? - And who told you that? She did, Mala. And Mala is called Mala, because it's the name that Jose's mother gave her. Because she died convinced that her husband in Rio was bewitched by a love potion. Or that the Brazilian was able to seduce him by conjuring a macumba. Well, in Rio de Janeiro, you can't even walk around all those macumbas. Alright... This is not the bus in the script, you'll have to repeat it. Alright. The bus in the script is one of those around midnight, half-empty, in motion... wider planes. Like this. This shot is fine. It's better than the first one. Very nice. It has good focus. Mala... I want to ask you something. The same thing of every year? Yes. No. Why not? Because. But if you love me and I love you... we would be happy. - Be good, Mala. - No. No what? You don't love me, I don't love you? Or you don't want to live with me? Yes, I love you, yes, you love me... and no, I don't want to live with you. I like... to depend on someone, someone to take care of me, I like to play with the magic lantern, make films, but outside of it, I already know that my life doesn't make sense. Have you ever thought, that your job of making movies Is in itself a movie that you make? I don't know what you mean. Sure? Everything is magic. I don't understand you, but it's the same. It's wonderful to be here on a Sunday morning, listening to Bach, and smearing a bit of metaphysics on a piece of toast. "Dear mom, I understand you very well. These things happen. Something similar, but more vulgar is my relationship with the mountain. It calls me and I have to go to it. I hope dad understand you and show his generous side. You deserve to be very happy. Kisses. I love you. Luisito." You don't know what it means to a Mom to have a son who writes like this. Your son writing is awful, he has no style or strength or simplicity. He's a corny and cheeky. "The mountain calls me". He writes just like when he was in school. Please, don't drink any more. My duties in this house... I have fulfilled. I gave you a son and I raised him. Lives his life and doesn't need me. You have your little books, your little theater, your little movies... You could say your books, your theater, your movies... Forgive me. But I don't even have that. You live surrounded by things you like, and that fill your time. No, it's over. I don't intend to continue with my arms crossed. And before it's too late. Very well, but listen to me carefully. And I speak to you coldly, calmly, without nerves. If you leave this house, little one, get used to the idea that this time... No, not this time, Fede. Don't start to act like John Wayne, this is very serious. Forget cinema for a moment, will you? It's terrible... to live with a person that with every new situation starts taking mental notes as if he were going to use it for his next script. OK, OK, so my sweet Pili, Pili the lively, My dear Pili has also a vial of poison hidden. Well, whatever, woman, goodbye and good for you. At least from now on I'll be what I've always been for the two of you: a ghost, a simple ghost. And if I want to speak like John Wayne, I speak like John Wayne and like the whore who gave birth to John Wayne. Fuck! But didn't you say that we still have Forzacao, my love. She's becoming a nun. - Who? - Pili. No. Why not? No, in that case I'd rather have her leave the minister. She's becoming a nun. - But who? - Pili. - And who's Pili? - My wife. Fuck... Pili Martínez de Lorenzo, my wife, is becoming a nun. - How come? - Like that. - I don't get it. - Me neither. Sorry, it's 2:30. - No, 2 and 28. - We're done. For me #12, but instead of two sausages, can I get two croquettes? That is #9. No... because #9 has Russian potato salad and this one has lettuce. - All right. - And you sir? - Vermouth with gin. - One more? Yes, one more, because I'm going to drink this one right away. - See? - I see. Well, then, take it away. What's wrong? Why are you so angry? It's not that he's angry, it's that he's unfriendly. Well, look, Ingrid Bergman was gorgeous as a nun in "The Bells of Santa Maria", Don't you remember? Alright. - Carmelite? - What, you're going to joke with this? The hell do I know? But where do I stand, with an alpinist son and a nun wife? To misbehave. Did you say nun? Nun? sure? Everyone is going to think that to live with me is more boring than living in a convent. - And it's not that bad, is it, Jose? - Boy, I don't know, no... Thank you! Get yourself something to eat, I'm fasting since yesterday. And...then there's the other issue. What am I, now? Divorced? No. Widowed? Neither. Single, well, neither. Hey, hey, the croquettes are great, it was a great idea to change them for the sausages. All right, OK. Stay there, stay there. That's it. Wet your lips. Wet your lips! - That's it. Everything OK? - Aha Silence! SILENCE! But who the hell is coming in? - It was closed, eh, Paquito? - It's because Don Matias has entered, with Mr. Alcántara. Sorry, sorry. Well let's see if it's true that we all get to shut up. - Motor. - Rolling. "Getting depressed", 44-1, first. Take the action, Victor. "I know you don't believe it, but I'm a child." "Emotionally I'm still a child, a child who's afraid of life." "You'll never get to understand it, but post-wars impact you in a tremendous way." "It's known, that when there's no bread, they give you taboos." "My love, I spend all my time thinking about you. I see a movie on TV and I say to myself: "Is he watching it? Did he felt the same as I did when they say such a thing?" "You'll say that since I don't have much experience on other stories, and it's true, to tell you all this doesn't mean much, but I love you so much, my love, that when I do something foolish, I say to myself: My God, if he knew." Cut! No, no, no, I don't like it, come on... let's do another one. Hey, more passion, you're in love with him, you're in love. - When did he left? - This morning, at 8. I took him to Barajas and thank goodness, today there was a flight. - Hey, what are taboos? - I think they're pussies or something. Pussies? But...but how ignorant you are. Taboos are a tribe of Indians, like the Cherokees, the Cheyenne, the Arapahoe... - What's wrong? - No, nothing. What's up, Fede? Balboa, his son died. Give me a cigarette. - What happened? - An overdose. They found him last night at a hotel in Tangier. Balboa have left by plane. Well, let's film. Fede, don't go, I want to talk about the opening. I'm thinking of putting the minister's voice in off. Hey, Manolo, don't say anything until the end. Sure. Silence, let's film. Patricia, come on. - Silence! - Silence! - Motor. - Rolling. "Getting depressed", 44-1, second. "I know you don't believe it, but I'm a child." "Emotionally, I'm still a child." Generational abyss. Here is the abyss. Read it... if you want to find out. Although it's not for cinema... no one pays to know the truth. This is all that I have left... of a 19 year old son. A notebook, where he says that his life is hell, and his father is a poor devil. A piece of wood without sensitivity, with whom he has never been able to speak. Do you know one thing? That father he talks about, I give you my word, it's not me. It can't be me His father loved him, loved him very much. Loved him with madness. As a child, he didn't pronounce the "r" well, so I went to his room every night, and we went with: "On Carretas Street there were runty curs..." As a grown up, I would've liked to continue to kiss him. Why is it so hard to say "I love you"? You who are a writer, What will become of my life, without those 19 years? 19 years. Do you realize? 19 years. My son... was only 19 years old. Balboa, I'm a very bad dialogist, I've never been able to write well let alone say that very simple line of "I love you". Maybe that's why my son is now on a mountain until one day... one of those pegs that goes into a rock fails, and good bye. We came for you, to take you to dinner. This morning, I watched the whole week's film. It's very good. Don't make it long. Try not to exceed an hour forty. Oh, and thanks. We go out on another night. Lots, and lots of happiness to all, on behalf of Spanish Television. We're already in the New Year. We have just arrived to 1984. These are its first moments and, as you see, they can't be happier. Our cameras cover the event, wanting to transmit and bring you, this same joy that is felt and heard in La Puerta del Sol. Joy that translates in: hugs, songs, congratulations, music, sound of rockets, rattles, whistles, everything that sounds is represented in La Puerta del Sol. Gone is already, 1983, a year that has already gone down in history... Now we are in the first moments of the year of 1984... Happy New Year. Should we have a drink... to celebrate? Thanks, I don't feel like it. Happy New Year. ... Stay in our company in front of the television, have a nice night and enjoy the program we have prepared. We return the transmission to our studio. We just started a new year, and I want to request yet again, that during the year, you remember every day, that only if each and every one of us, puts his part ... respecting traffic regulations, and to the people who share the streets with us, We'll get these streets, to be as safe as we all want. This is a General Direction of Traffic's advice. Ah! Happy and safe 1984. - Cheers. - Cheers. I walk you out. Have fun. Remember me, be good. And remember to come to me, eh? Kiss Me. Sure. Goodnight. Happy New Year, dad, let's go with your double step. Oh, do you know where's your granddaughter? Well at home, having fun like crazy, with her little sister, mother and grandmother. Can't she see that the guy is with his kids? Well, she's at home, at home, waiting for him to call. Well, great. Next year will be different, my love. We'll spend it together in Venice or New York. OK, OK. You remember? They always played "Suspiros de España" on Radio Madrid at 12 o'clock. And tears will always came to you. Of course, dad. Yes... yes, double steps are great. They give you goose bumps. As Fede says, They have confused us a lot, with the "españolada". We've been ashamed of many of our things, that are wonderful. What I liked the most in school... was to clear the blackboard. I always volunteered. And that's because, since I was a kid, I have had the need to forget. When I grow up I want to write a book of amnesia. Sounds good to me. And that book, will be a detailed account of everything that I managed to forget And why is that? It'll be an unforgettable book. No, fuck, it'll be a forgettable book. My father always says: "Behind every book There's a boring afternoon. " By the way, hey, when are you going to bury your father? Excuse me, man, but that thing with your father... Fuck, dude, you’re... you're loony bin material. And it's about time, you let the poor man rest in peace. Hey, you think I'm an asshole, and that I don't know that my father is dead. The thing is... that if I definitely get rid of my father, Who will I talk to? But, hey, does your father really talk to you? Can you see him? No, it's always a voice over. Hey, what do you want? There are people who die and, nevertheless, are still alive. I talk to my father about what I want, and he answers me, and that's it. I was able to talk about everything with my wife. Except of many things. That's why I tell you that we should be like mussels. Mussels have a huge advantage over us humans. - In what? - In the matter of understanding. Don't you know what happens to the mussels? No. Enlighten me. The mussels... change sex. They're females a season, then they're males. And so several times throughout their life. They're females one season, then they're males. It's one hell of a solution, that way there are no problems when it comes to understanding, and they can live their whole life together. Hey, come here. Do you... do you know how mussels live? Well, like that, all together, side by side, those guys. - The word mussel... - Fuck them in the ass, the mussels are male or female, do you understand? Our true drama, do you know what it is? So I am going to tell you. That we have grown older without realizing it. And I ask you, do you know why? Listen, listen, the word mussel, that comes from the Galician "mexillón", with an "x", it's a vulgar name, because the real name, the scientific name... Damn it, Federico, I've asked you a question. To me? Do you know why we have grown old without realizing it? Well for a very simple fact, because we haven't lived. - Oh no? - No. No, "they" have lived for us. We have always lived lives that were not our lives, because in our lives there are only stories... of other lives. You... Are you sure? Are you sure of that? Completely, completely Federico. We're unreal, we live in a movie state. In a state of literature. Of course... so... Wait! Wait a moment that I'll help you. Invented parts of our life contain certain truths. Scott Fitzgerald in "Tender is the Night". But what the fuck does that have to do with the mussels? What are we talking about? The true scientific name, as I was saying, is mytilus edulis. You're drunk, eh? - You're totally wasted. – He-he-he - You're totally wasted. If we were like mussels... He-he-he! If we enjoyed of something like their sexual condition, ...I would allow to look it over, he-he-he! Well, every once in a while, I would be my wife - and my wife would be my husband. - Where am I? Where are you? And no more problems, hey, that would give marriage, an ambiguous morphing face and even, and even, multipurpose. No, I didn't like at all that you removed my bed scene where the girl talks about the multipurpose generation. You always cut my scripts, why did you CUT IT? Because we have dedicated our lives to cinema, and cinema has ran over us and crushed us. Of course, Hollywood really did a good thing for us. What? - It helped to crack our glorious empire. - Oh really, how? It informed us that being Spanish wasn't being the most important thing in the world. - Yeah... They went... the jokes went like this: "A Frenchman, a German, and an American, and a Spaniard." - And a Russian. - And a Russian, a Russian. - And they were all assholes, they were all assholes. – Ha-ha-ha. Except us. But fuck it, it was Saturday, you went to the neighborhood movie theater, Four afternoons of continuous sessions and you left without a penny. Broke, after seeing Robert Mitchum, Charlton Heston, - Clark Gable... - And even Fred McMurray... All so tall, so blond, with those pecs... And those bulks in their arms. You went to bed with the "fondarino", the next day when you talked about it with the Political Education, channels and ports' professor... - I was saying... - Queers, queers, all those artists are queers. Now that was an empire, fuck. Of course, they immediately came back saying: "What a Spaniard doesn't reach with the tip of his hand, reaches with the tip of his sword." Eduardo Malquina.... to say: enough, then go on a sword fight with those lyrics, With a scratchy voice, it doesn't bother you? it doesn't? bo... An... anyway, that after some time, we managed to retire. And the sons of Nestlé's young lions They shot up, up, up, and everything turned to shit. We didn't got that right either. Now, the dwarfs are in fashion. Dudley Moore, Woody Allen, Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman. Hey, I just realized. What? That I didn't bring the car today. Hey, hey, if you want, I'll carry you in my arms? "Since I was a child, I've always been fascinated, by the big cities." "They are hot and tender as a last hug." It's very dark, isn't it? They always say that it's fixed in the laboratory, but you see. I told him many times. - Oh. Well whatever. ... With the truth and with the lie.
