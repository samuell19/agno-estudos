Your hands touch me with feeling. Darkness eats away at the ceiling. Our fingers a familiar duet, Shoes tossed aside, tossed away. On this chair, on these dresses, I give in to your caresses. The walls are harsh and white, That's where our shadows start their flight. Our mouths as curious as can be, The world's shifted ‘round you and me. And our whispers are a blessing, I give in to your caressing. The smell of skin has filled the air, We forgot that words are there. Eyelids hide the light they caught, Honey-heavy head bothered by no thought. I'm exalted, saint-like, waiting, Your caressing has me panting. Faces hidden in the night, But we're filled with all but fright. So much yet there is to happen, But for now your soothing presence Keeps me calm and keeps me guessing, I give in to your caressing... - Would you like some tea? - No, thank you. I should get going, I have a lot of work. - She looks a lot like you. - You like it? - Sure. Can I take it? - Why not. Maybe it will bring me luck. Maybe so. You know what? I came to that exhibit by pure accident. - Do you regret it? - No. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. And you? I was there accidentally, too. I was invited by my husband's colleague. - When will he be back? - Who? Your husband. My husband is dead. Really? Yes. I'm sorry. What's your phone number? What, you want to call? 341-08. I'll call you. Bye. - Adam! - What? Don't forget when you call, I'm not at home after 10. Alright. Bye. He scored with yet another girl. I shouldn't be judging him like this, really. I cried. He didn't ask why. Why didn't he stay over? He doesn't want to be a bother... Tomorrow or the day after that he'll call. I wonder why she didn't mention her husband earlier. That was awkward. But I think it's for the best I didn't stick around. She cried. I wonder what she thinks of me. I'll call her tomorrow or the day after that. Mister Pietrzak! Come ‘ere. - Good morning, sir. - What is this? - They brought it here in the morning. - Aren't you in charge? If it rains again all this cement will become a pile of wet shit. That's right. You're always right, sir! Your critique is valid. However, I have no men. - Bring the crew here. - How could I... - What's going on? - This. Please, take care of this, for God's sake. I have no men! Well then get some to come, it's all up to you... - Hey. - Hey. We have to talk. I've looked for you all over yesterday. - What do we do about that contest? - What contest? The theatre one. You said something about that. Right. We'll get to it in a few days. I have to think about it. What about the floor elements? We're supposed to receive them tomorrow. We're playing cards at 6 p.m. - I'm not sure I'll be able to come. - What's up with you today? What? Why? - What do you mean? - You got a smoke? I've been thinking about her for the last couple of days. I'm not sure why I haven't called yet. I really would like to see her more than anyone else. I wonder if she'll be surprised... Miss Ewa! You must be freezing. I brought you some tea. I may have added some rum to it, too. - It'll warm you up. - Thank you, Father. I'm about to wrap this up. Drink up, child. You're not looking very well. You look sad. I know, you're still grieving... But you're young. You can't live like this. The grieving has to end sometime. God doesn't like sadness. Why do you assume that I grieve because of my loss? Do I really look that desperate? I'm old, you do not have to hide anything from me. If it brings you any solace, open up your heart before me. I understand everything. It might seem scandalous to you, but I'm not grieving my husband's death at all. I do feel sorry for him, but I lost 7 years of my life to that marriage. I've only realised it recently. By accident. I realised that I could go through my life and never really know just how happy I could be. Maybe it's only an illusion, this image we have of what happiness looks like? I'm scared to meet Adam again. I don't want this to be an illusion. Don't let your heart be filled with fear. - Do we have anything for dinner? - For sure. Sorry, Basia... Wait, I'll empty the tray. - Would you like some tea or coffee? - Doesn't matter. - How much sugar do you take? - One spoon. Come here. Listen... I'm feeling a little... Tired. Do you want to go somewhere? Turn around. - Yes, hello? - Ewa? Teresa speaking. - I'm happy to hear you. Are you busy? - It's fine. What's wrong? We wanted to go to the movies with Staszek. But he has some assembly, so he can't come. Want to come with? - What time? - Right now, 6 p.m. Club Cinema. - Alright, I'm leaving right now. - I'll be waiting. See you! Thank you. Don't bother. You're so tired, after all. And don't even try to call me. - Hey, it's been so long! - Too long. I've been looking for you for 2 weeks. I called you yesterday evening. That's right... I was just leaving. I even went to the movies. - Hence... - Wait, let me help you. Do you have time? I do. Your hands touch me with feeling. Darkness eats away at the ceiling. Our fingers a familiar duet, Shoes tossed aside, tossed away. On this chair, on these dresses, I give in to your caresses. The walls are harsh and white, That's where our shadows start their flight. Our mouths as curious as can be, The world's shifted ‘round you and me. And our whispers are a blessing, I give in to your caressing. - Ewa... - Wakey, wakey! Listen! Leave that alone! Leave it, Ewa! I'm Pluto the dog! I'm so embarrassed! I'm embarrassed in the morning! He lost his mind! Cha-cha-cha! Look what you've done... Drink this. Wait... like the Turkish! Adam! Ewa! Eat up, before it gets cold. - Some bread? - No, thank you. - Is it not salty enough? - Just a bit. Is this what happiness looks like? How long can this last? What does he think when he looks at me? Why doesn't he say anything. Do we have nothing left to say to each other? Maybe he's thinking of someone else? I want to know. This soup really isn't very good. But is it important? She's so good, so caring... In a few hours it will be night again and just us two. The way she looks at me... Pretty good! What's the next step? I already told you: I paint walls and I'll keep painting them. I heard you. You paint walls. I don't appreciate your shouting. Then why do you annoy me? I'm only here for one day. I deserve to know what my child lives off of. Let me tell you: it's ridiculous. Painting walls is hardly a job. It's not a sure way to make money. I don't need money from you. I can manage on my own. So you say. I was only asking, anyway. And I answered you. You should find an older man. A guy that thinks of a home, and not of... Well, anyway, my dear... Today a woman without a man is worth just as much as in the past: literally nothing. You understand? I'm telling you - nothing. Excuse me, mum, I need to check on my laundry. This isn't Stefan's. - He used an electric razor. - Yeah? I remember well. You're right. - Is he married? - Your coffee is getting cold. How much does he make? Maybe it's for my armpits? When did you meet him? Not long ago. Come on. - Can I have some vodka? - Of course. This is simply too much for me. Why did you sell that beautiful apartment of yours? You're squatting in this attic like a hippie. Here. Is he going to marry you? - I don't care about that one bit. - You don't care?! Yes, and more than that, I really don't need marriage to be happy. Your definition of „happiness” is very peculiar. - Who is that? - A person. Don't joke around. I'm only here for one day. Do you know what I read a couple of days ago? What an intelligent person you've become. So very intelligent. Soon you'll be ashamed of your own mother. Where does he work? You shouldn't care about that, you hear me?! It's enough that you wasted 7 years of my life! 7 years! - You're not going to tell me anything? - Precisely. You'll come begging for help. Oh, that you will. Would you like one more cup of coffee? I want nothing from you anymore. I'll try on the dress and I'm leaving. I bought it at Telimena. Well? - Christ. - And another king of hearts. Marek, your turn. Here, a seven. Ten. Your turn, Ewa. Ace. - We win. - Deal cards. Small casino! Good job, Isa. If you didn't play the hearts, we could've... You're right, I accidentally helped. Your turn to deal, Ewa. I've got a headache. Do you want a pill for that? - This seems fine, right? - I think so. Now for the transit. Look. You need to mark the two streets here... Draw the bus route here. - Right here, okay? - Sure. - Make sure to mark the parking lines. - Yeah, sure. - Good morning. - Hello. I was coming back from Teresa's and decided to drop by. Make yourself at home. - Hello. - Hi. What about that string of houses? Well, you can just go underground from N3 and it will be fine. - You want something to drink? - No, thanks. Maybe I should make you guys something? - I don't know... - Do you have a lot of work left? Yeah, we still have to do some things. When will the typist bring that description? Tomorrow morning at earliest. Will the boards be marked on it? That guy is supposed to bring them by soon. „Soon, soon”... What time are you coming over for dinner? What? I was asking when are you coming for dinner. How many boards do we have left? 7. See, I can't really predict when we'll be done with this. I'm going to go then. - See you. - Bye. I'll come over as soon as I'm done here. - Hello. - Hello! Why are you here today of all days? I thought you'd visit on Saturday. I was extremely busy. And the weather was bad. What would you like? - Are there any of those... - No, they're Czech. - What would you like? - Two coffees, please. ...no one cared about anything. Here we are, eating our breakfast, and on the radio we hear that thousands of people were just killed somewhere, and it makes us feel nothing at all. As if they said the weather is going to worsen. We just stopped caring about people dying and human misfortune. We're only interested in ourselves anymore. Just ourselves. That can't be. It simply can't stay like this! I want ice cream. What's that? I want ice cream. - You know what you are? - I do. I want ice cream. You...! Again. Calm down, you hooligan! No, he has to. Because he loves humanity. Beat me. Kick me, what are you waiting for? I deserve it, I'm just like everyone else! Let him go. He won't beat me anymore. If you don't get any rest, those eager chimeras will eat your brain. And everything will drown in chaos. They don't even know what hunger is. They lost all reason. Right! - Shall we go outside? - Yes, of course. Look, it's sunny here, and there it's starting to rain. I hope it doesn't rain here. Doesn't matter. Hey! - Hey, Adam. - Good morning, Basia. Who's that? I met her some time ago. Before. - Did you finish your coffee? - Yes. Let's go. I've got a headache. - Good evening. - Good evening. Why are you late? We were working up until now. But we're almost done with that project. We have to send it tomorrow at latest. We wanted to go get a drink to celebrate... But we were so tired... - Here, drink up. - we just split and went home. Ewa... I'm getting up at 4. tomorrow. We're going fishing. Marek found a great spot where there's bass like this. Maybe like this. You have different loves, I have different voids. Your coldness pushes me Deeper and deeper into them. But still you're my light, You light my way down. When I stop loving you, What will become of me? I know now, it's as clear As the morning sun. And my heart must rot Burdened by that grief. Because I can take you never For myself forever. You cannot be me, I cannot be you. Girls, love us! Girls, love us! Girls, try one more time. Don't look for any reason. Wait a moment... I'd like to propose a toast to our wonderful winners! We don't know if the project will be built, but they won the contest, and that's all that matters! Love us, as much as you can! Love us, girls... Girls, love us... At least once in a while... Believe in your heart's beating, Girls, love us! Girls, love us! Try to understand, It's all that matters in life! Girls, love us! Are you having fun, Ewa? Not really. Let's get a drink at the bar. Go ahead, I'm going to stay. - I'll join you in a second. - We'll be waiting. - Are you feeling unwell? - No. What is it, then? I've got a headache. You've been having those a lot lately. Want to leave? I'll stay if you're having fun. Stay. Maybe I should just go. I'll drop by the bar and then we can leave. Alright? If you want. Well? Can we go? Only one step to fall in love, One single step, no less, no more... Only one step to fall in love, You've got to take that chance and go! You could have stayed if you wanted to. I can get back home on my own. Look... It really was too loud and stuffy in there. Maybe we should grab a drink in here? If you want to. What about you? I don't really care. Go ahead. And I want you to know that we're done here. I don't want to see you ever again. What's wrong, Adam? I'm sad to say goodbye, but I don't want to see you anymore. What is that supposed to mean? - At all? - At all. You've wasted and spoiled the most important day of my life. This... - This is the end? - Yes. It's over. Why, Adam? Just go. I'm not leaving until you explain. - Just go, please. - You have to tell me. If you don't get it on your own, then I really have nothing to say to you. Why though? You have to have a reason. Go. I didn't do anything wrong! - Don't make a scene. - Adam! - You said something about honour once. - What honour? That's not true! It's impossible! Tell me it's not true. Tell me you're joking! - Ewa, go away. - Just today, we... Calm down. Okay, but tell me... - What is there left to say? - Tell me it's not true. That I'm only dreaming. I can't help it. It's true. That's impossible! Don't you remember what you told me? Nothing was ever fixed by reminiscing. - You just never loved me. - I did. - Then tell me why! - What am I supposed to say? Whatever it is, you have to tell me! That won't change anything. At least then I'll know. Tell me. I'm begging you! Don't you understand that you're absolutely unbearable?! I can't stand being around someone so greedy, so jealous of everything, every word, every move, every look, someone so completely spineless! Now, go home! Go! Yes, hello? Ewa speaking. Adam, I need to see you and talk to you. There's nothing to talk about. Leave me alone. I'm tired. Listen to me. Are you listening? Yes. I'm really not that stupidly jealous. If it's a woman... - Do you know what time it is? - I don't. Adam... It's 5 a.m. I just went to bed. Please, listen to me, I'm not jealous at all. There was no one to be jealous of. Leave me alone. Stop bothering me. Bye. Is that you? - It's you? - Yes, it's me. Good morning, darling. What happened? Nothing happened, I'm just visiting. You always tell me before you come to visit. I forgot. I must be getting old. No, you look great. You really think so? Of course. Say hello to your mother. - You must be hungry? - Yes, yes. - I'll prepare something. - Do, do. I need to tell you something. Your mother's gone insane. What happened? I'm getting a divorce. You? I know you hate my father, but... You always spoke of rules... Rules, shmules... There's a man that wants to marry me. - It's love. - Don't tell me about love. He's an older gentlemen, sickly, surely you understand... I don't. He has a huge house, a beautiful garden... He'll leave it all to me. And in a year or two... I can manage... Is that you? What happened? I came to talk to you. We have nothing to talk about. What do you mean? We can't throw everything away just like that. You have things to explain to me. What is there to explain? It's all pretty clear. I think I deserve 5 minutes of your time. Adam, please... A minute or two... - How are you? - Hi. Come. I can't help you take your paintings to the fair, darling. I promised to meet Tomek at the Artist Association. But I brought Andrzej with me, he'll help you get your stuff over there. He's my cousin. Introduce yourself. I really can't. I'll drop by in the evening. I have to go. - Aren't you in a hurry? - I've a lot of time. What are we doing? Over here. I need help transporting these packages. We have to hurry up, I was supposed to be there at 12. Excuse me, I have to get dressed. Nice place you got here. I remember when you visited Teresa for the first time. I don't think you remember me, though, I was just a kid back then. Of course I remember. You were very loud. You wanted to have everyone's attention no matter what! I guess you've grown up a little since then. I guess. You can't really talk to them anyway. They only care about cars, clothes, stores... - What are you laughing at? - At you. There's nothing funny about that. I'm sorry. I just remember something. I'd like to see how you work. And talk a little... - Can I call you and visit? - If you'd like. What happened to that Ewa of yours? I haven't seen her in a while. I haven't seen her either. It's been 2 months. You looked so happy when you came to us for dinner. Those stuffed tomatoes were really tasty. You liked them? They're our specialty. She looked so fascinated by you. Like an 18 year old. Yeah... She had a bad marriage experience, a loveless relationship, and that's where the young girl-like reactions came from. You think? I think it happens without a marriage like that, too. You know... In the olden times, they used to call it „love”. There! Did you see? Bass. Have you heard this poem? Pleiades, the October constellation. I don't recall. I once told it to a girl, and she asked if I wrote it. Don't you write poetry? I did before I finished high-school, but not anymore. Do you know Boy-Żeleński's poem from "A Word or Two"? Sweet lover of mine, Teach me your little song, So that every line Shows me that we belong, So that every word Becomes a whisper sweet as night, And when it's repeated, Becomes just what we might Say under the cover of dark. - Do you know it? - No. I think it continues like this: I'll think of a theme So very sentimental, And then I'll surely dream Of a poem of us together. Andrzej... Yes? Kiss me. On the lips, silly. Don't be frightened. I'm not, not at all. Let's go then. - Sure. - Great. Wait, my car's still being fixed. We'll take mine, no problem. There's this great spot for catching pikes... Where? You'll love it, man. 30 km from here. - Are you kidding? - I swear! Then you drive off road for 2 km and you're there! Damn! Hello? Hello? Hello? Adam? What's wrong? - Can I come in? - Come in. What happened, Adam? You know... We were going fishing, and... We had an accident. - Marek is dead. - No...! When? 5 days ago. Ewa... Can I stay over? Do you want some coffee? I was about to leave. No, thank you. Where are you going? I'm meeting my a friend from my old school, Ania. It was a very boring school. Silly. Bye. Come back soon! Come on, woman! Wait... Can you play your hand? You're taking your sweet time! Just a moment... Let her play it out on her own. They've been scheming for so long now... Well? - And there we go. - We got it. Let's grab a bite to eat. Okay, darling. Wait, let me help you. - Why are you so angry? - Me? - Why? You're wrong. - Aren't you? This bigos is very tasty. When they leave, we can spend some time alone... Watch it! I burned myself. What's wrong? Nothing. Why are you crying? What happened? Was something wrong? - You... - What did I do? You never go on walks with me. What about it? I really love taking walks. We used to do it. You're hysterical. You'll see. I know someone who will walk with me. He's young, just 20 years old. His name is Andrzej. - Okay then. - You'll see... Just sleep now. "I'll be back at 8 p.m. Tea is better than vodka! Love, Ewa" - Good evening. - Good evening. - You were supposed to be back at 8. - Don't be mad. Teresa took me to the movies by surprise. Look, Ewa... Please, stop acting like this. Stop pretending you're a total idiot. Please, stop acting like this. Sometimes I think you've gone insane. You know that this house is equipped with a telephone. Don't interrupt me. Just this once. If a situation arises that you're going to be late, you must call me! I need to know what's going on! - Nothing happened! - Nothing happened? Didn't you leave a note saying you'll be back at 8 p.m.? It's 10.15, and you're still not back! I'm sitting here like an idiot, wondering what's happened! Remember that you have a telephone. Call every time. Then maybe I can stop imagining these terrible things, you getting hit by a bus or a tram... Who knows what else! Especially since that kid called asking about you. Don't act like an irresponsible idiot. You're not alone in this world. Stop getting so hung up on everything. You used to be back late all the time, and I said nothing. I was working, you're just running around. And you always knew where I was and why I was there. Don't use such dumb reasoning with me, - it makes me very angry. - I'm very angry myself! - You idiot! You moron! - Idiot! You're disrupting my work, sir. Let me remind you that our sole purpose is completing this project as fast as possible. I'm glad to hear we're on the same page. Please pay the designers for their overtime work. Unless you don't want us to make this deadline. I'm done, too. You think that I'm just a kid looking for a quick flirt. A lot, and fast. Where did that come from? I don't think that. Why, then? I can't explain everything to you. It will be better this way, both for you and for me. We can't meet like this anymore. But why? For me, you were... Don't be hysterical. We kissed a few times, and that's it. You'll find someone more suited to you. A younger girl... I already told you I'm not interested in young girls. You'll get over it. I have to go now. So we won't be meeting anymore? We can't. - Goodbye. - Let me kiss you one last time. Andrzej, that won't help anything. You really didn't need to bite me. Don't call me again. Open-pit mining these days is based mostly on highly effective quarrying machines, that also help transport... What are you doing? Watching TV. Where were you? At Teresa's. Then I went for a walk with the kid. What do you want for dinner? Whatever. - Ewa. - Yeah? Come here. What? Who bit you on the neck? You, I think. Earlier. Are you sure? Who else, silly? Exactly. Who else could have done it? I'm surprised you're having doubts. I don't have them anymore. That's how it should be, doubting Thomas. Leave it. I don't have doubts, because I know I didn't do it. Stop it. Wait. I didn't do it because of 2 reasons. Firstly because I don't really make a habit of biting people's necks. Secondly, I noticed you trying to hide it from me. Wait a minute. Who did this to you? - The kid. - The kid! Yes, him. When we went on that walk, I told him we're not going to meet anymore. Then he tried to kiss me. I tried to step away, and then he bit me. It was stupid, Adam. I know I shouldn't have let it happen. I didn't want you to see it, so I covered it with powder. It's all so stupid, you know it yourself... You're lying. If it was the kid, you'd have told me instantly. It was him! It really was. No, that's not true. You're lying to me. - You're lying to me, and... - I love you. I did everything so that we... I planned everything for you, but you...! - Adam... - Ewa! - What do you want? - Tell me the truth. I told you the truth. Wait a moment. I'll forget everything. I really will. Just... Tell me the truth. I want us to trust each other again. I want us to be happy. Please, please, tell me! Well? It's Teresa's husband. She wasn't home. - I didn't know she's out. - Yes, what happened then? - He kissed me... - And then? I struggled, but he overpowered me. - And then he kept on kissing me... - And? And then I heard Teresa walking in. Just like a comedy! You think I'm going to believe that? Please, tell me the truth! Tell me all of it! She didn't really come home. What are you doing? You have to give birth to that child. No doctor will go through with that procedure. It's too big of a risk in this specific case. I hope, that you won't try anything stupid and try to get rid of the child on your own, because that would definitely pose a threat to your life. You should give birth anyway. You're getting too old. Maybe it's a good thing this happened? Someone for you, Adam. Thank you. Hello? You have to come home at once. - What happened? - Don't ask. Just come. If I mean anything to you at all, you must come. You hear me? What happened? Please, come, I'm scared I'll do something bad. I'm begging you, please, come. Calm down. I'll be right there. Ewa? Ewa! What happened? - Don't touch me. - What happened? I hate you! You egomaniac! You think you're the only one that matters! Your imaginary jealousy, your stupid manly honour... Me? I don't matter to you at all! I'm nothing to you! I'm garbage! You don't care at all about what happens to me! - Oh, God! - Ewa... Why did we ever meet?! - Ewa, please... - Why did I have to meet you?! - Please, calm down... - Don't touch me! I'll tell you, so that you don't imagine things. Listen now! You were never good enough! In bed. You hear me?! In bed! Hit me now! Hit me, I'm insulting your goddamn manliness! Ewa... Ewa. We need to stop. We will stop speaking and acting against each other. - I will stop, at least. - I don't believe that. Please, trust me. - We can't keep living like this. - I don't believe you. Ewa... What do you say we get married? What? Tell me. Would you like that? - You're lying. I don't believe you. - I swear I'm being completely serious. - Would you like that? Tell me. - You'd really want that? - Really. - Why? Because if you don't want me, then no girl ever will. - You yourself said I'm terrible in bed. - It's not true! I said it to annoy you. - Okay. - I'm sorry. It's okay, calm down. We'll get married, and then you have to rest. If you don't get any rest, those eager chimeras will eat your brain, and everything will drown in chaos. Remember? Adam... We'll be happy together. We'll be alright.
