"Phone rings" [Lightening] [Thunder] [Phone rings] Operator At the tone, please record your message. [Beep] MOM Hey, I tried to get a hold of you. I don|t know if Kadin talked to you about wanting to go camping at your Dad|s property. I|m feeling very uneasy about it. I can|t stop thinking about Avery. I feel like I have to keep Kadin near me all the time. I just don|t want him to go out there by himself. He|s insisting on doing it alone. I don|t know what to say to him. You know, with everything that has gone last year. I|m not feeling well about this. Especially after that suicide murder that happened near the property. Children were killed in that house. It|s horrible. Anyway, maybe you can call him and talk him into doing something else next weekend. Maybe plan something with him. Just give me a call back, okay. Bye. [Kids screaming] [Kids laughing] [Kids laughing] [Kids laughing] Avery! AVERY Kadin. [Car honking] Hey sleepy head. How long was I asleep? Ed. I don't know, maybe twenty minutes. I had another dream about Avery.longer than that. She's always in my dreams too. I miss her too buddy. Do you think she's still alive? Do you have everything? El it. Uhh, I think so, yeah. Now you sure you want to do this? Okay, well if you decide if you don't want camp out anymore you Listen Kadin... I know I have been over protective lately. The last two years have been very hard on all of us, you know.imes. Six more miles. How many graves do you think are out here? I don't know, quite a few, Some of those graves probably don't have markers on them, there so old. Why would they burry people in the woods? They would burry their loved t ones near their homes. That's what people did back then, I guess. You're not going to be afraid to ghost hunt out there by yourself? I spoke to Papa this morning and he knows your going to be setting up camp.t. Do you remember how to get out there? Yeah, I know. Well, Papa is going to be hunting, so if you decide to go back early, he said he'll leave the back door open for you. Hey, are you listening? Yeah. Is he going to be hunting all night? Here we are. Okay, what are the rules? Don't go too far from the campsite. Keep the fire under control. Keep my phone with me at all times. And I mean at all times. Call me. Huh? Call me now so I know your phone is working. Okay. [Phone rings] Okay good, I want you to call me as soon as you find a spot and set up camp. Okay. Do you need my help? I got it. Okay. Love you. I love you. You be careful out there, okay. I love you and I want you to be safe. I will. I love you. Mom! [PAPA VOICEOVER] Kadin, Sorry I didn't get the chance to see you this morning. You know me, I'm an old early bird. I'll be out most of the day and night. But, if I get a chance, I'll stop by your campsite. If you decide you don't want to stay outside I left the back door unlocked and there's food and rootbeer in the fridge. Love Papa.
