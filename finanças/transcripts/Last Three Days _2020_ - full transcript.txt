Hey, Dave, is Leo, tried your cell, didn't see you guys today, but good news, Judge Ramsey's getting us that warrant. Looks like a bust for Monday. Call me back. Later. Jack, what are you doing here? The neighbor called, said he heard gunshots. We headed straight over. Make sure Dave is okay. Roger. John, this is not what it looks like. What exactly does this look like, Jack? Here. - Isn't this your wife? - Yes, yes, this is my wife. I'm going to need you to step aside, Jack. Um... Hi. Look, I'm sorry, but, um, that's my tree. Um, funny... I don't see your name on it. It's just that's my study spot. It took me a long time to find the right tree with, you know, - enough shade and a great view. - It's a great view. Okay, I tell you what, I will give you this spot... if I can take you to dinner. Okay, sure. Yeah? Alright. - Thank you. - Hm-mm. Okay, creating false memories... D. - Wait, what? - The answer is D. Wait, how do you know the answer is D? And you said you were going to give me this tree. Technically I said I was going to give you that spot. - It's Grace's psych class, yeah? - Yeah. There are so many reasons for false memory. Hypnosis, age regression, chemical imbalance. It's always D. All the above. - So you want to be a sidekick? - Hey! My dad is actually a nurse too and just because we don't have PhDs, it doesn't make us any less important. Whoa! I did not mean to strike a nerve. Uh-huh, yeah. - Besides, every hero needs some help. - Not Superman. Well, my mom is pretty super. What about your family? The only thing my dad ever taught me was to never be like him. It was my mom who showed me there are things in life worth fighting for. So is that why you're studying criminal law? Let me guess. Matlock or McCoy? - I didn't realize that you, uh... - What? Nothing. It's just you, uh... you look really good for your age. Come on, haven't you ever heard of reruns? - Uh. - My dad and I love those old lawyer shows. Okay, well, I'm sorry to disappoint. I will not be in the court room. I will be on the streets putting the baddies behind bars. Okay, so, like The Dark Knight. No, Batman is a vigilante! The end does not justify the means. Well, you did just give a girl the test answers so that she would walk to the cafe with you, so... Okay, well, I can't help it if I have a good memory. Okay, so you are a mash-up of Batman, Matlock and Mr. Monk. Yeah, you're not good at this whole comparison thing, are you? Well, I mean you did start by calling me a sidekick, so... I will try to keep my foot out of my mouth for the rest of the night. Well, I'd say your odds are pretty good, because I'm meeting some girls inside. Wha... wha... what about, uh... Dinner. - Technically I said you could take me to dinner. - Mm. And here we are. Okay. Well, can I at least have your number? I thought you were the world's greatest detective. Yeah, but I don't even have your name. Figure it out, Batlock. Okay. - Jack. - What? That's my name. Jack. Jack Cluff, not Batlock. I want to know your name. I want to know your number. And I want to take you to dinner, and not dinner here like, a real dinner. Batlock, are you asking me on a date? It's Jack! It's Jack. And, yeah, I am. Will you go on a date with? Or coffee. Coffee's fine too. Your phone. Bye, Jack. Hello, you've reached Beth. Sorry, I can't answer. But your call is so, so important to me. Please, leave a message and I will call you back. Thanks. Bye. - Hey. - Here is your coffee. Okay, mister. Quiz time. So, tell me, what are the four loves? First love is what the Greeks called storge. The family bond. And the second love is called philia. The friendship bond. Thanks. And what's the third love? Eros, the erotic love. It's that tingle in your fingertips, that weakness in your knees. - Hi! - Hi! - How are you? Good to see you. - Good to see you too. Merry Christmas. - Amen. - Amen. What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say the word and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down. Hey, that's a pretty good idea. - I'll give you the moon, Mary. - I'll take it. Then what? From the moment I saw you, I knew I wanted to know everything about you. Watching you with your family, with your friends, you have shown me what love looks like. So I commit my life, and my heart, and my love... ...to you. And to you alone. I join my life to yours in this moment. Until time stops. As we strive ever toward that fourth love, I take you to be my wife. It gives me great pleasure to pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride. Okay, here we go. This is it. Jack Thomas Cluff... it's amazing how quickly you've become my best friend. I take you as my husband and my partner in crime. I love how you cheer me up when my world is falling apart. You bring me coffee just to say I love you. Though life may change, know that I will always be by your side. I give to you my heart, my soul, my all... to be yours alone. Now and forevermore. - Yeah, wondering if Jesse's home. - Jesse who? - He doesn't live here. - Yeah, well, uh, you know, that's his car out there. Look, lady, I've got a warrant. You can't just barge in here. Oh! Damn! - Drop the gun, Jesse. - Stay back! Whoa, Jesse, we just want to talk! Ah! Hey! I got the right to carry, man. It was self-defense. - Yeah, got a right to carry this? - It's not mine. Assault with a deadly weapon, possession of illegal substances. How about we take a little ride downtown? Hey! This isn't a warrant! Nah, man, I'm not going back. - Ah! - With a record like yours, I don't know, it doesn't look very pretty. But there's a way out of this, Jesse, you know that, right? Hey, look at me. Sometimes in life we're giving second chances. What we do with them is up to us. Small blind, people. Yeah, I like to mix the cards. Hi, everyone, you need to go home? He is good, check him out. You guys are late. Hey, yeah, not too late. You can still deal us in. Next time, you're out. Blame this guy. The lucky bastard had to go and score. It's not luck, it's skill. Shotguns only hold five rounds. Now, let's guy beer. We, uh, got our third witness today. Now all we need is a warrant. We got ourselves a bust. Sure, but no matter how fast we bring them in, there's always more. They say the Yaku are in on the game now. Next thing you know, it'll be gang wars. Bastards. Dealers are nothing. We cut off the heads before the war begins. Come on guys, give the rookie a break. He's earned a name for himself. Looks like you're earning more than that, rookie. Small blind. Big blinds. Watch out for Dave. He does what he has to do to win. Well, I fold. It's just a game right. Come on, Roger, you telling on me? You know, I got your back, right, Jack? Hey, guys, give me just a second. - Hey, baby, what's up? - Hey, sorry, I know you're off grid. I just I wanted to make sure that you were okay. - What was that? - Nothing, the guys just get kind of rowdy when they are playing poker. Poker, huh? - Beth, look... - Is Dave dominating again? He seems to be doing that a lot lately. You know how the guys are, this is just their way - of bonding and I... - And you're the rookie, right. Look, we knew it was going to be like this. I'm new to the team. People would kill for a shot like this. This is how the guys build trust. It's not just a game. It's work. Well, then have fun at work, Jack. I have to go. Beth! Jack, come on, man! You're up? Alright, let's do this. Come on! Here, let me. - Thanks. - Anytime. Dr. Manny to surgery two, please. Dr. Manny, surgery two. Great work tonight, Beth. You are your mother's daughter. ...which corresponded to a report of shots fired on the west side around 10:30 p.m. On arriving at the scene, the officers came under heavy fire. No officers were harmed, but the suspect managed to escape. Upon further investigation... - You all right? - Yeah, Mom. Be careful, it's really hot. No further information at this time. No, I mean... Dr. Manny said you seemed a little... Emotional? At least someone's paying attention. Is it Jack? He's trying to make detective and I get it, - but it's... - Tomorrow's your anniversary. You know, believe it or not, our marriage wasn't always perfect. - Med school was tough. - What did you do? We had to make the decision each day to trust each other... to love... even when we didn't feel like it. Jack loves you, even if he doesn't always take the time to show it. How can you be sure? That's why they call it trust. Three more have been found dead in the gang related shooting over what authorities believe to be a new drug from Japan. They're calling it "reaver," and as of now, it's full effects are unknown. Some say the Japanese gang, the Yaku, may be responsible for the emergence of this new drug. This, when coupled with a rise in violent crime, has many worried for the safety of our streets. ...have been identified as members of the Manos Coltellos again dealing primarily with narcotics. Authorities speculate this to be yet another violent message from an unknown rival gang, possibly a battle over territory rights. The police are doing everything they can to find those responsible and bring them to justice. According to the BGA, the dreaded gang war is now at an unprecedented level in the city. The Manos Coltellos will retaliate... ...it's only a question of... I am saying a little bit of fun, a little bit of action is not that bad. She's hot. She is eating out of the palm of your hand. It's not going to happen. Okay? What... what... well, what's wrong? She is not your type? My father was the biggest disappointment of my life. I do not plan on being that for someone else. Yeah, and how many times I tell you not to wear that thing in the street? Someone sees that, they're going to know you got a heart and then they going to tear your heart out. You know, I was married once. I didn't take you for the marrying type. Yeah, neither did she. So what happened? I thought we were in it together. Partners. She was going for prosecutor, I was going for the badge. Law and order. Well, turns out she didn't really like law school. Uh, what she really liked was traveling. You know, she wanted experiences, travel the world. I couldn't really afford that on a beat cop's salary. Tell me about it. Beth keeps wanting to go to Hawaii. I'm just putting off talking about it. All my old lady ever wanted to do was talk. What she didn't do was listen. Anyway. One day I... came home, empty house. Divorce papers. - I'm sorry, Dave. - Oh, no, don't be sorry. Letting her go was the best decision I've ever made. I mean, if your old lady doesn't listen to you, then she doesn't respect you. And then you're in trouble. You got to find a partner you can trust. Somebody who's got your back. - What's up? - One of my contacts. Where are we going? We got our witnesses. We got a new lead. Hi, how are you doing? Just two. So what are we doing here? Well, I'm about you, but I'm fixing to have a nice hot cup of tea. - This isn't your usual crowd. - You are right, Jack. But you know what they say about desperate times. The Yaku, Jack. That's out of our jurisdiction. They deal in arms trafficking, prostitution, not narc... Narcotics? Didn't you hear what Leo said? Or were you too distracted? Focus, Jack. Why have you come? Do you speak English? You came to me. This is my house. Hell with this. - Manos Coltellos. Does that mean anything? - Dave, she doesn't - speak English. - They're tired of your nips - moving around the market. - She doesn't understand... Shut up, Jack. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Coltellos want me to send a message. But... they're old news. And the Yaku use a little bit of help expanding their markets. Amane? Is there a problem? No Problem. Just business. Amane? That is your name? The Yaku have a very bright future here. You just got to know how to play the cards right. We know the city. We could be the ace up your sleeve. Dave, come on. Let's go. Well, Dave. Looks like Jack does want to play this game. He'll come around. What the hell was that? - It's called a bluff. - This isn't poker, Dave. Come on, Jack. This isn't training day. This job is risk. And if you can't handle that, you should have been off the team a long time. No, you left me in the dark. We were supposed to have each other's backs, right? I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, rookie. We're partners, what we do we do it together or we don't do it at all. This isn't busting dealers, Jack. This is the big leagues and you need to keep up. The Yaku messed up. They're making enemies, and there's a gang war on the streets, and we have a chance to stop that. We play this right, we could topple a crime empire. All their other trafficking, they've had deniability. Generations of covering their tracks, but they're new to narcotics and that's our game. So what do we do? We tell the team? We get back-up? No. - The team is built on trust. - Well, now our team is built on trust, Jack, you and me. It's what you asked for. I did not sign up for this. You signed up for this when you joined the dope team, Jack. We broke protocol. We went in there without a warrant. We went in there without a motive. - We didn't have anything. - And we tell the rest of the team and they'll all be liable. - We're going to get our facts. - Your contact. Maintains anonymity and deniability. That's the deal. You want to be a hero, Jack? This is how you do it. You take the dirt so nobody else has to. You can walk home right now and leave this all behind. Or you can make a difference to city. Have you got my back or not? Yeah. I've got your back. Good. Good. Alright, now, let's loosen up. It's been a tense day. You doing alright. You doing alright. I'm just trying to keep up, alright? - We'll see you there at the strip club. - What? - Wait, where are you going? - Don't be late. We're all going to the Boom Boom Club. No, I have to go. I told Beth I'd be home an hour ago. Mrs. C, she's not going to miss you. Come on. First lap dance is on me. - Come on. I got dollars. - No, stop, stop. Alright. Oh, here. Just pick me up in the morning. Think fast! Thank you. - Alright, you guys have fun now. - Goodnight, Jackey! Hello, Jack. Hi. Where were you? I was out. I thought that you said you'd be home at 10:00. Look. I know that your work is unpredictable, but... - today was... - Today was a very long day. Today was our anniversary. For months now, I've been patient, I've been supportive. I haven't known when you're coming home, if you're ever coming home and I spent the entire night preparing us this meal. And all I asked was when you would be home and then you show up late, and are you drunk off - of your ass? - Maybe if you had just told me all of that instead of being all coy about it... Okay, no, no, today is our anniversary. Do you have any idea... - what my day has been like? - No! Because we don't ever talk. I can't tell you what I do, Beth, because every time I go out that door, my life is in danger, so I have to keep everything a secret and I do that to keep you safe. I do that for you. No, you do it for you. You do it so you can be like some kind of hero! Maybe I do it because I want to get a little bit of respect. Because I certainly do not get that from you. Go to hell, Jack Cluff. - Well, where are you going? - I'm going to work. Well, you said you wanted to talk, right, Beth? So let's talk! Listen to me when I'm talking to you. Well, I guess you were wrong. It looks like you've turned out exactly like your father, Mr. Cluff. Beth. Beth! Please. Please, just give me Jack back. Please. "Go to hell, Jack." "Just like your dad, huh, Jack?" Hey, Dave. Where are you guys at? It certainly like sleeping under my truck... Two for those guys. It starts raining. - Hold on. - What? I have to see a friend. What? You were just telling a story. You can't... Come on, man. Have fun! For you and your friend. Thank you. Dave. Oh, look, look who is here. - Hello? - Hey, Jack, it's Roger. - You doing okay? - Uh. Yeah, sorry, man, I guess I just... I, uh... - I overslept. - Well, that warrant for the McPherson house came in over the weekend. Careful of Leo. He's pretty pissed at you and Dave. - Why? - We haven't heard from you guys since Thursday. Jeez, - talk about separation anxiety. - Jack, - you've been off the grid all weekend. - Uh-huh, very funny. What? Hey, you reached Dave. Leave a message and if I feel like it, I'll call you back. Later. What the hell, Dave? - Hey you, this is Dave. - Where are you, Dave? - Where are you? - Looks like you missed me. Leave a message or... You have two unheard messages. Hey, Dave, it's Leo, tried your cell. Didn't see you guys today, but good news, Judge Ramsey's getting us that warrant. Looks like a bust for Monday. Call me back. Later. Dave. I did it. I finally did it. I left Jack. We had a fight and I'm scared. I'm scared of Jack. No, I can't! I love you, Dave. Dave! Police! Is anyone here? - Jack, what are you doing here? - The neighbor called, said he heard gunshots. We headed straight over. Make sure your Dave is okay. Roger. John, this is not what it looks like. What exactly does this look like, Jack? - Isn't this your wife? - Yes, yes, this is my wife. I'm going to need you to step aside, Jack. - Hello, you've reached Beth... - Come on, Beth! ...sorry... Hello? - Shawn! - Jack! - Hey! Look. - Where are you? - Something's happened, okay? - Jack. - I need to find Beth. - Jack, Beth's gone. I need to find Beth... Sunday? That's why she hires the best. Not a word. Drive. Or what? You are going to shoot me? So who are you? Where am I? That reaver really did a number on you. Didn't really affect your partner. Says something, doesn't it? What do you know about my partner? I know that lying bastard got what he deserved. You kill him? Watched him bleed out in front of me. And you're setting me up? Well, aren't you perceptive? Pull in here. Keys. And what about the message? That Beth left. Was that a plant, too? Oh, you mean her. You know, she's a real looker. It's a shame what we had to do... What did you do to her? Where is she? Oh, shit. Damn it. Beth! Beth! Beth. Dear Jack, happy anniversary to the world's greatest detective. It feels like just yesterday, we promised to commit our lives to each other until time stops. I wish I could turn back time to be with you more, kiss you more, tell you I love you a thousand times more. But the hands on the clock only move forward, so I'll just have to say it now, today and every day. I love you, Jack. Striving ever towards that fourth love. Love, Beth. Okay, mister. Quiz time. - That's why I'm studying. - Yeah, but if you want to pass philosophy you got to know your stuff. So, tell me. What are the four loves? The first love is what the Greeks called storge. Uh, it means affection. It's, um, it's like, it's like, uh, what you feel for your mom. A fondness from familiarity. A family bond. - Dave! - Jack. - You are alive! - I hope so. - I've been trying to reach you, man. - Oh, you've been trying? I've called you three times, amigo. Jack. What the hell, Jack! - Saturday. - Yes, it's Saturday. Come on, let's go! I'm in your driveway. Get your ass out here. We're going to be late. We've got one shot at this. Come on, come on, come on. Hello, you've reached Beth. Sorry, I can't answer. Please, leave a message and I will call you back. Thanks, bye! Took you long enough. When is the last time you saw Beth? - Mrs. C? I don't know. - Think, Dave! When is the last time that you saw her? I don't see your wife! Damn, man. What the hell? Have you been using? I mean you look worse than you did yesterday. Look, man, I know you're all spooked, but there's nothing to worry about. You heard Ronin. He is going to take us to the top. All we got to do is get some evidence, we get a warrant and boom! We nail them. What if it's a trap? Come on Jack. If they believed us there is nothing to worry about, we're fine. Look, they're not going to kill insiders from Coltellos. And if they don't believe us, hey, we're cops. They're not going to have the whole department coming down on them. Either way, we're safe. Yes, I just... I think... Wait, wait, what? What? You got a bad feeling? That is why we take precautions. This is when you cross the line, rookie. When little boys become men. Yeah. Oops, forgot that one, didn't I? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Guys! I'm just going to have a little puff. Anybody got lighter? I find it takes the edge off. Anybody? No? Your loss. If they smoked on duty, it certainly will be their loss. Amane. Ronin. Dave. May I? Jack, you don't look so good. Ane-san? If you are from the Manos Coltellos, what can you do for me? What we bring to the table is experience. We know this city. Right now, you're at the edge of a war for the streets. We could be the difference for you in that war. The Ane-san would like to know why she should trust you. A man who has obviously not worked in drug trafficking, and a man who is a traitor. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, wait just a second. Here, we honor loyalty and trust, but why should I trust men whose loyalty comes at a price? I told you it's a trap. Hey, hey! Ronin, you said we had a deal! You will tell us the truth. - What it costs your partner is up to you. - Dave... I told the truth! Listen, we work for Manos Coltellos. We thought we could help the Yaku and make a little extra cash. - That's it. - Dave! - No, no, no, wait, wait, wait! - Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop! Please, look... we're cops! We've been investigating the Yaku's recent involvement in narcotics. We got back-up waiting right outside. I said we wanted the truth, Dave. Amane! It was a trap! We should have had a plan. It's okay, Jack. We've got what we need. What the hell! Come on! Dave, come on, man! I got you. Come on. Come on, man. The evidence! - Dave, no, we have to get out. - Jack, go! As long as you have that they are not going to kill me. Go! You're a real piece of shit. - Your partner know that? - Don't get... don't get righteous on me. You and me, Ronin? We are the same. We both do what we have to do to survive. No, Dave, we are not. I am not a traitor. You know, I almost feel sorry for your partner. He has no idea what you've gotten him into. No, hold on! And the second love is called philia. And it's the friendship bond. It's being there for each other. Having each other's backs. No matter what. Hello, you've reached Beth. Hello? - Jack. - Patty. Thank God. Look, I got... I got nowhere else to go. - I got nobody else to call. - Beth said the same thing last night. You've seen Beth? Look, she's in danger. I lost her. I don't know how, I don't know when, I've tried - for days and now, and now Dave... - Dave? Jack, what was that? Jack? Jack? Dr. Robinson. Dr. Robinson! Sir. Beth. I'm going to need some help! Relax, just relax. Here we go, okay. - Where is Beth? - Beth's fine. I spoke to her just a few minutes ago. What is wrong with me? Besides being a jackass? No, the headaches and everything. I don't know. Maybe it's the lingering effects of a high-potency narcotic. Beth said you were too committed to the job. What? What is this? LSD? Meth? No, this is something entirely new. Reaver. - What? - The... the club... I... Have you ever heard of a drug that alters your experience of time? Not experience. - Perception possibly. - Perception. It could make you feel disoriented, like your memories are out of order, maybe even create false memories, but that's it. They're memories. You can't change what's happened. What is going on with you, Jack? I don't know, Patty. The last three days - drug... - Not just the last three days. I feel like I've tried so hard. Now I think I've really lost her. Not yet. Beth, honey. Um, I'm going to run some errands. You going to be okay? Yeah, dad, I'll be fine. Sweetie. And, uh, what's the third love? Eros, the erotic love. It's that, um... That tingle in your fingertips. That weakness in your knees. That passion in your heart. That kind of love that chains two people together in ways that move them to do great... or terrible things. Oh! No! Hello, you've reached Beth. Sorry, I can't answer, but your call is so, so important to me. Please, leave a message and I will call you back. Thanks. Bye. I left Jack. We had a fight and I'm scared. I'm scared of Jack. No, I can't, I can't, I can't. I... I love you, Dave. Jack, it's a setup! Jack, it was a trap! - I have what you want. - So you took my phone, too. - I want my wife back. - You don't get to make demands here, Jack. Jack! October 22nd, 1112 Crestview Lane. Where did you get that information? I have a lot more than that. And all I have to do is text over a picture of this manifest to my friends, add that to you letting me escape and I'm guessing that things are not looking too good for you, Ronin. What if your wife's already dead? Have you thought about that, Jack? Then your life is over, and I won't be the one to pull the trigger. Your husband is a risk-taker. But he's gambling with the wrong man. Call me back. Call me back. Come on! No! No! Come on, man! Why? Why! Hello, you've reached Beth. Oh, come on! - Everything alright? - Yeah, it's fine. It's just this stupid coffee maker. Yeah, they can sometimes be a little finicky. - Thank you. - No worries. Take it easy, Mrs. C. Think fast. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going? - I'm out, Dave. - Out, what do you mean out? - Out. I tried to change tomorrow. I couldn't. So I'm changing today. But Jack, get a grip. Everything's going according to plan. Yeah, it is. But it's not your plan anymore, okay, Dave? It's my plan. I got a wife, man. And it's time I start thinking about her. Mrs. C? Your wife? You've seen her lately? What... what are you doing, Dave? You're in too deep to just walk away, Jack. Things are going my way. Mm. No. Dave. Why are you doing this? That's what I love about you, Jack. Always looking for the best in other people. You know, the police aren't the only ones that want the Yaku out of business. That whole, enemy of my enemies is my friends thing? We're going to be heroes and we're going to make my friends very happy along the way. And nobody's going to get hurt. Ah! Amane has a little friend. Nice. Here you go. Right. Looks like we have a little leverage. Best you look the part. I just don't want you getting too carried away out there. You know, my guy at the hospital better get a text every 15 minutes. And if not... Come on, Jack. Let's go. Call him off! You won't shoot me. Don't bluff when I got the winning hand. It's time for you to fold, Jack. Oh, man. It looks like you only got 15 minutes. Hello, you've reached Beth. Sorry I can't answer. But your call is so, so important to me. - Please, leave a message and I will call you back. - Shit! Thanks, bye! And after the past few days, I know that now. I'm sorry. Please. I can't. And the fourth love. It's the greatest love of all. All the natural loves are conditional. They can be broken. But the fourth love is supernatural. It can't be overcome by anything... in this world. And it's not based off of anything you do to earn it. It's giving everything you have and not getting anything back. It's giving somebody a second chance, even when they don't deserve it. Yeah.
