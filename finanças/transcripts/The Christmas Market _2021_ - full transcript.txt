Mayor foster speaking. Yes, Mrs. Markowitz, I completely understand, but the snow plow driver cannot do individual driveways. Well, I know there are private companies that do this kind of thing. I'll tell you what, I will personally make sure that our office gets back to you with some numbers, okay? Great. We'll be in touch soon. Okay. Have a good day now. Not again. Ooh! Ah... um... Just a minute! Mayor foster speaking. Hello there, Mr. Taylor. What can I help you with? Uh, I know the detour is such a pain, but it's only temporary. It will be done soon. You know what? I can't give an exact timeline at the moment, but I will check with the contractor and get back to you. Merry Christmas to you, too. I can't force the grocery store to change their flooring. I will make sure they put out their mats, though. You're welcome. Okay. Okay. Bye now. Man: Come on! Hi. Hi, there. Good morning, everyone. Uh, please follow the detour sign back that way. Yeah. Oh, I got it! - Woman: What's happening? - Man: Come on. Here we go. Alright, there we go. Yes. Turn around and back that way, please. Yeah, you'll have to turn around. Thank you. Right back that way. Hi. Morning. Morning, mayor. You directing traffic now, too? When duty calls, I guess. Any idea when these repairs will be finished? Not sure if you've noticed, but this detour is leading people right out of downtown. I know it's an inconvenience, but the contractor says it'll be done soon. What's his definition of soon? Two weeks? Two months? Two years? Some of us might not be in business by then. Is it really that bad? I don't want to speak for everyone, but it's definitely not good. Let me follow up with them again. Well, that'd be appreciated. Thank you. I... Sorry, I'm late already. I'll see you around. Bye, frank. ♪ Mayor foster: Morning. Hey, honey! You forget your coffee today? I sure did, Jo. Honey, you are working too hard. No such thing. Large black coffee coming up. Thanks. Oh, and a coconut milk latté for Gina, please. I thought assistants were supposed to get their bosses coffee, not the other way around. Ah, but then I wouldn't get to see you every day. You know, I actually just ran into frank. He said business has been pretty slow with all the construction on the bridge. - He said that? - Yeah. He also said he's not the only one. Is everything okay? We'll survive. Jo, please. You can be honest with me. I just want to help. Is it bad? Oh, no. It's alright, honey. No, it's not. Leave this with me, okay? Okay. I'll be in touch! ♪ Oh, hi. Oh, you're sweet, aren't you, huh? What are we gonna do, huh? Yeah. Ruby. Looks like you've been summoned. Gina: Mm-hm. Yep, uh-huh. They come every single time it snows. I know, it's great. Thank you. Okay, yes. I will let her know. Okay. Buh-bye now. - Mrs. Markowitz? - Yep. She's good to go. Oh, and the snow plow guy sounded super cute, so don't be mad. Gina, you gotta stop doing that. Besides, I don't have time. We need to focus on the town. What do you mean? Main street is a ghost town thanks to those bridge repairs. It's really bad. Worse than we thought. How's that possible? I made those revenue loss projections myself... I know, but we didn't account for this many delays, especially this time of year. Hm. Well, what can we do? Call the contractor and lay the hammer down. Can you get me his number? Yeah. There's just one thing. What? He's on vacation... In Jamaica until the new year. You've gotta be kidding me. Well, then we find another contractor to finish the job. Yeah, but that's breach of contract. Plus, it's the middle of winter. Most construction's already shut down. I... Well, we can't just do nothing. I have to fix this. Okay, but... Nope! No buts. It's happening. How? I don't know yet. But I'm going to figure it out. Okay. ♪ It's open. Hi there, sweetie. Hey, dad. Mm. Something smells good. I made your favorite spaghetti sauce. I just gotta throw on some noodles. You didn't have to go to all this trouble, hm? We could have just ordered take out. Dad, when is the last time you had a home cooked meal? When was the last time I was here? My point exactly. Plus I know that you have that burger joint on speed dial. What? They're good. Anyway, enough about me. What's... what's with the tree? Oh. Yeah, I know. I'll get to it eventually. Everything okay? Ah, nothing for you to worry about. You sure? Hm? Need my help? Nope. I invited my dad over, not the ex-mayor. Why can't I be both tonight? Why don't you sit down and put your feet up? Why don't I just set the table, hm? Meanwhile, I need you to look through that box. I'm finally finishing the basement. I need to get rid of some stuff. You have no idea how many boxes of Christmas decor your mother had down there. You know, I have plenty of stuff already. Yeah, I know, but those pieces were special to her, and I thought you might wanna keep them. Hollybush Christmas market. You used to love building that village. You'd come home from school and stare at it for hours. ♪ You know, I used to think it was you dragging your mother around to that market, but I'm not so sure. She spent a fortune down there. Oh, wow. Of course. What? Spend a fortune. That's it! A Christmas market! A what? You are a genius, dad. Thank you. ♪ Both: Hi! Thanks for coming in so early. Of course. What's happening? I figured it out. Okay. Awesome. Figured out what? How to fix this construction mess. Hm? The first annual Hawkins bay Christmas market. It's perfect! We'll find an accessible spot, give a booth to every shop on main street. We'll bring in a Santa, and a Christmas tree. We'll have mulled cider and hot cocoa and every kind of Christmas cookie you can think of. Hm. If we can't bring people to main street, then we will bring main street to the people. Wow. I love it. I know, right? But Christmas is in a week. Do you think we really have time to pull this off? We find the time, Gina. Okay, so first thing's first. We find a location. Somewhere off the downtown strip but still close. And parking. Endless parking. Seems easy enough. No... What about here? That's the arena, remember? That is a no go. Minor hockey would revolt. Not to mention the figure skaters. Never mess with the figure skaters. Wait a minute. What about the old textile mill? Big spot, parking lot, overlooking the river, very christmassy. Kinda perfect. Yeah, but that's the old Hawkins mill. - So? - They'll never let you do that. You don't know about that. When was the last time someone from your family spoke to a Hawkins? 1989? That's probably accurate. But it's been vacant for 30 years, and I heard they live in Florida now. It's probably fine. The parents live in Florida, but the son still lives in that big old house on the hill. - Really? - Yep. Darcy Hawkins. Notorious recluse? Oh, come on, he can't be that bad. I'm just saying I think it would be a good idea to have some other options. What other options? Exactly. This is the spot. Just leave it to me. Okay. Hello! Oh! Oh, I am so sorry. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Oh, god. Oh! It's you. I saw you on the street yesterday. I didn't mean to surprise you. It's fine. We just don't get many visitors up here. What can I do for you? Oh... um... I'm Alex foster. Mayor Alex foster. Right. Sorry. Not really keeping up on local politics these days. So, you might have noticed some of the construction issues - on the bridge. - Hard to miss. Right. Well, had to be done. Upgrading infrastructure in this town was long overdue. I agree. I've been saying that for years. Great. Yeah. Well, so, unfortunately, it has led to some unforeseen consequences for some of the local businesses, which brings me to the reason I came. I was wondering if you would be interested in leasing the old mill? Just for this week before Christmas. We're throwing an old fashioned Christmas market and we think the mill would be the ideal spot to host it. Kinda late notice for a Christmas market, isn't it? Look. The truth is, tourism has completely bottomed out, and I have to find a way to boost sales for the folks on main street or they might not make it through the holiday season, and the Christmas market is the perfect solution. And not just that, you know, it would also be a great way to bring the entire town together. You know, Christmas spirit and all that? I don't know. I'd prefer not to get involved. You wouldn't have to be involved. We've got lots of help so you wouldn't have to lift a finger if you don't want to. I'm sure there's a better place for it. Well, that's the thing... There just really aren't that many options. You know what? I'd really love to help, but I just got so much going on, and, uh, good luck. Well, don't give me that look. Mayor foster: Hey! I heard what you said, and I would just really appreciate it if you take a look at this. It breaks everything down and I think that once you've had a chance to read it, you'll see the benefits to the town may outweigh your reservations. So, my number's on the front if you have any questions, and I really look forward to picking up this conversation once you've had time to review it. So, thanks so much for your time. What's all this? Finally spreading some Christmas cheer around here. How'd it go? He said no. Please don't say I told you so. I would never. Although, I think I bought us some time. I gave him the pitch document, so now I have an excuse to go back tomorrow and follow up. Hm, and what makes you think he's going to change his mind? I don't know. Everybody wants something. We just have to figure out what it is. Hey! Oh, good, you're here. I ordered us a gallon of coffee. Thank you. Any luck digging around? No. So far all I've heard from people is that he is quiet and has a cute dog. I mean, there is no social media on this guy. Nothing! Zero. What about you? - There's not much. - Hm. But I did find out that he went to boarding school in Europe. Is boarding school still a thing? Apparently with his family, yes. - Hm. - After that, Ivy league college for civil engineering, graduated top of his class. Okay, that's something. Where's he working now? I don't know. I mean, the only other stuff that I could find with his name are articles about his dad. Uh, and apparently yours, too. Mm-hm. "Henry Hawkins accuses mayor art foster of defamation." Defamation? What's that about? Well, I was pretty young, but from what I remember, dad told some reporters that he thought Hawkins closing down the mill was the worst thing to happen to the town and let's just say that Hawkins did not take kindly to the bad press. Do you think that Hawkins junior is still upset about all this? Well, hello ladies. Hi, Brent. And how are we this morning? Good. Busy. Right, of course. Always busy. Can we help you with something? No, just picking up some donuts for the committee meeting. Gotta support local, especially right now. It's been pretty quiet around here lately. Anyway, I should get going. Have a good day. You too. Gina: Bye. Hm. It's a shame the two of you didn't work out. We only went on a few times. Sure, but the mayor and the city planner? Hm? Could've made headlines. Anyways. So, we've got a decades-long family feud and absolutely no leverage. What are we gonna do about this guy? We go back to the basics. Okay. What... what does that mean? Jo, I'm going to need a dozen of your best treats. - You got it. - Baked goods? Really? It's a start. Oh, and do you have any more flyers for the choir event tomorrow night? Over there, honey. Okay, I'm loving the confidence, I am, but, just in case, I'm going to get started on plan b. We are not gonna need one. No one can resist Jo's baking. Hi. What are you doing here? Just admiring your... Super nice chairs. Wow. Did you make these yourself? Yeah, and they're a gift, so. Oh. Sorry. Wrap those back up. Anyway, uh... I brought you these. I didn't make them, so I you promise they're good. I wanted to apologize for yesterday. I took you by surprise and I put a lot of pressure on you and I'm sorry. Thanks. I appreciate that. And I'd like to make it up to you somehow. You know what? I'm good. But, uh, thanks for these. I really have a lot to do today, so. Is this about our dads? What? Because I know that your family is not exactly a fan of mine, and maybe there's some residual stuff to work through. Yeah, I don't think so. 'Cause I just think that this market could be the perfect way to put the past behind us. Just think about it. The fosters and the Hawkins working together to help the town? You know, we could right the ship, weave a new narrative. Yeah, I'm not really interested in weaving any kind of narrative. Oh... just tell me what I can do... Woman: Darcy?! Gran? You okay? Oh, everything's fine. I just can't find my playing cards. I was going to cue up a game of solitaire, but I... Oh. Hi. Hello. I didn't know we had company coming. We're not actually. I'm Mary Hawkins. It's a pleasure to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm Alex foster. Foster? As in art foster's daughter? That's me. She's the mayor now, too. Well, I must be a lot older than I thought. Mayor foster. Please, come in, and sit in front of the fire, and play cards with us? Darcy'll make us some tea. You know, mayor foster's a very busy woman. I'm sure she has better places to be. Actually, I'd love to stay. Thank you, and call me Alex. Oh, wonderful, Alex. We so rarely have company. This is thrilling. Go and get out the best China, Darcy, and put on some Christmas music. I love Christmas music. Do you like Christmas music? - Alex: Oh, who doesn't? - Yes, well, come with me. So, do you play gin? Uh, yeah. ♪ Oh, Christmas tree oh, Christmas tree ♪ ♪ Thy leaves are so unchanging ♪ oh, Christmas tree oh, Christmas tree ♪ ♪ Thy leaves are so unchanging ♪ not only green when summer's here ♪ Gin. Again? Wow. You're good. When was the last time you played? Not since I was a kid and clearly it shows. Don't let him make you feel bad. I beat him most days. I let her beat me. He's lying. You can always tell with this one. He puts on his gruff exterior, but really he's just an old softy. And did I tell you he built me these beautiful new chairs for my porch? What? How'd you know about that? Well, I saw you wrapping them up out there in a big tarp. Not exactly subtle. Oh, and next on the docket is my new apartment on the river. No, that's not happening anymore. No, it's not happening yet. There's a difference. What apartment? It's nothing. Anyway, can I get us some more tea? No, I'm good, thank you. No. I have plenty, thanks. Okay, well... - Mrs. Hawkins. - Mm-hm? I'm not sure what you're up to tomorrow night, but the local choir is performing at the chapel. There will be snacks and drinks and we're donating all the proceeds to the mission. Oh, how wonderful. It's usually a lot of fun. I thought you might like to join us this year. What do you say, Darcy? Well, um... We don't have anything planned as far as I know. ♪ Thy candles shine so brightly ♪ Whatever you want. We'd be delighted to attend. Thank you for the invitation. You're welcome. Well, I should probably get going, but thank you for the tea and the cards, even though my ego may never fully recover. Any time, my dear. Bye now. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Well, I guess I will see you tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it. ♪ Good morning. Hi, I got your message and pulled all the building permits made in the last ten years. Thanks so much. Great work. So, tell me, what are we looking for exactly? Well, it turns out Darcy is not the only one who lives at the Hawkins estate. He's been looking after his grandmother, too. Okay. That's kind of cute. She kept mentioning some apartment that he tried to build for her, but it fell through. Okay. So, it got me thinking. Maybe at some point he applied for a building permit. Hm. So, are we thinking vacant land or a tear down? I'm not sure yet. Well, let's find out, shall we? I swear I've got paper cuts on all ten of my fingers. How is that even possible? I think I even chipped a nail. Ah-ha! Both: The mill. Of course. Looks like he wanted to turn the top floor into apartments. And some commercial real estate. Some shops and restaurants. Honestly, not a bad idea. And some accessibility ramps and elevators. - For gran. - Aww. Alex, look. Dad. Hey, dad. Hey, there she is! Thanks for coming on such short notice. My pleasure. So, how's the Christmas market thing coming along? Well, we've actually hit a little bump in the road. Oh? I found the ideal spot to host it. Good. Though I just have to convince the owner to lease it to me. Well, you talked to them about it, didn't you? I mean, you explained the situation? Oh, yeah, but he's been resisting. So, I figured why not try an old fashioned trade. Uh-huh. That's my girl. And as luck would have it, I found the perfect thing to offer him in return, but... It might disappoint some people. Are you asking my advice? I am. Well, in my experience, you can't please everyone, but you have to think about the long term well-being of the town and make decisions that are going to benefit as many people as possible, but no matter what you do, someone's always going to be disappointed. And what if that someone was you? What do you mean? I want to host the Christmas market at the Hawkins mill. What?! And to do it, I'm going to get this permit approved. Refurbishing the mill looks like a really sound investment to me. More real estate close to main street, more shops and restaurants, too. It looks like the kind of long term economic boost we need. But I know you disagree. For good reason. You don't know that family. His father nearly sunk this town when he closed the mill, and he didn't give any of his employees notice. He just left, leaving hundreds of families without income, and then he got mad at me for being honest about it. I know, dad. But that was almost 30 years ago, and Darcy is not his father. Oh. Darcy, is it? Huh? First name basis already? We've had some preliminary discussions, yes. Look, Alex, I would never... I'll never tell you what to do, but it feels like you're letting the fox back into the henhouse. I disagree. Well, hey, you're the mayor, and you got to make, you know, whatever decision you feel is right, so... Look, uh, I got some things I gotta do. So, we'll talk later, alright? Dad. ♪ Hi, Brent. Hey. You look nice. Oh. Thanks. Actually, I'm glad you're here. You are? Yes. I would love to set up a meeting with the planning committee about this. Oh. All the assessments have been done on the property and everything looks in order. This is for the Hawkins' mill. Yes, it is. But it's actually a really great plan. You know, we've been talking forever about expanding the downtown core, and this could be our chance. I'll need some time to look this over. Absolutely, but at first glance, nothing jumps out at you, right? Well, I've seen a lot of mills like this be refurbished before. So, it should be doable. Okay. Great. Thanks. So, I guess I'll see you in there. Yeah. Sure. ♪ Jo: Hey, honey. Hey, Jo. It looks amazing in here. Thank you. You waiting on someone? I am, actually. Oh. Is that... Yep. Mary and Darcy Hawkins. Wow. How'd you manage that? Hi! I'm so glad you came. Wouldn't miss it. Look at this place. I'd forgotten how beautiful it is here. I'll grab us some seats. Don't worry. I actually saved us some up front. Front row, to the right. Oh, well, thank you, dear. Thanks for coming. I wasn't sure you'd actually show up. Gran's pretty persuasive. I can believe it. So, do you recognize anyone here? Not many by name. Okay. Well, that is Jo. Owner of the one and only Hawkins bay café. Ah, yes. The maker of the treats you brought us. Exactly. She's about as pure and kind as a person gets. Heart and soul of main street. Hi. Thank you so much for coming! So, those were the reids. They own the gift shop right next to frank's antique store. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for coming. I hope you're all having a good time. We have such a special treat for you tonight. It's my pleasure to introduce you to the Hawkins bay choir! She loves it. Thanks again for coming tonight. I hope you had a good time. I did. And I haven't seen gran that happy in a long time. So... thank you. See? We're not so bad if you give us a chance. Yeah, I just wasn't sure how it would go. It was a long time ago. Listen, um... After your gran mentioned the apartments the other day, I did some research, and I discovered your plans to refurbish the mill. Oh. Now, I know my dad turned them down, but I actually think it's a really great idea and I would love to help you make it happen. - Really? - Mm-hm! Yeah. I think it's in the town's best interest, and your gran's, too. And I would tell you that regardless of the market, but then I would be completely undercutting my bargaining power. Fair enough. I like a good trade. So, what do you say, Mr. Hawkins? Should we make a deal? We'll approve your permit and you host the Christmas market? You got yourself a deal. Good. Great. Thank you. Oh, gosh, I should call Gina, because there's so much to do! Um... Should I meet you at the mill tomorrow and we'll go over our plans? - Sure. - Okay, I'll see you soon. Okay. Hi, Gina. Good news. The Christmas market is a go! ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ I'm sorry, frank. It's the end of an era. Oh, don't say that. Are you sure there aren't any other options? Hey, guys. Frank, you okay? He had to shut down his shop this morning. What? No. I just can't afford to keep digging this hole through the holidays. Figured it's best to close up now before things get worse. Give myself a chance to figure out the next steps. Did you give up your lease already? Not yet. Why? Because I may have a way to help you. I wasn't able to speed up construction, but when I told you I had your backs, I meant it. So... Welcome to the first annual Hawkins bay Christmas market! This Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night at the old Hawkins mill. We've got booths for each of you, we've got mulled cider and hot cocoa and treats galore. We've got Santa and a tree and presents for the kids. It sounds perfect, Alex. Really. What do you think, frank? Are you sure you can get enough people to attend? It's kinda late notice. I personally guarantee that you will have more business in one night at the market than you would have at your shop from now until Christmas. Guarantee? You haven't seen Gina work the phones. Mm-mm. She will have everyone and their grandmother there. Jo: It could help to get you to the new year, and then you could reassess. Yeah. It could. So, does that mean you'll do it? Count me in. Me, too. Okay, we've got work to do! - Yes. - We gotta go. We do. Okay. We'll be in touch. Jo: Thanks, girls. ♪ Darcy: Hey. Good morning. I haven't been here in so long. I'd forgotten how nice it is. It needs a little tlc, but it should get the job done. - You want a tour? - Sure do. This way. I thought this might be the best spot. It's got the high ceilings, and room for a lot of people. It's beautiful. You think it'll work? Definitely. Mm-hm. We could spread the booths out around the perimeter and have a big tree right here in the middle. And we could put Santa right over there. Sure. Yeah. Sounds good. Oh, and then we'll need to round up some booths somehow. I could help out with that. Really? Yeah. I got a bunch of lumber at the house. I could put some together. That would amazing. Thank you. You're welcome. They teach you how to build stuff like that at boarding school? No, I... taught myself. How do you know I went to boarding school? Mm. I may have looked you up. You're kind of an enigma, so I had to resort to the Internet. Yeah. Find anything interesting? Just boarding school and college, neither of which quite seem to match up with you. Yeah, I, um... Let's just say I didn't really fit in with the crowd. Kind of kept to myself. Now, that last part sounds about right. Both: Yeah. You wanna see where gran's apartment's going to be? Absolutely. Alright, it's this way. So, all the apartments are gonna have their own balconies, but I really want this one to be gran's. It's got the best view of the river. Oh. It's perfect. Yeah, the house is just so big and it has so many stairs. I worry about her being on her own when I'm not there, you know? That's understandable. She's really lucky to have you. Were you two always this close? Yeah. Well, she practically raised me. My mom and my dad were always busy working or traveling, but most of the time it was just the two of us. She's done so much for me. I just really want her to have something she loves, you know? Anyway, what about you? What was it like growing up the daughter of the mayor? It was... all I knew. When I was young, I spent a lot of time with my mom. My dad was always working. But then after she passed, my dad just kinda dragged me along everywhere. Is that why you ran for office? You want to follow in his footsteps? Not really. I just had some strong opinions about how to do things my own way. Huh. Yeah. I noticed. Well, I think this is gonna be great. In fact, I might just have to move in right next door when it's all said and done. Well, gran would love that. I might have to get better at gin, though. That's true. I mean, that's if the permit gets approved. Oh, don't worry. It will. ♪ That's correct. Opens this Friday night. 6:00pm sharp. Okay, great. See you there. Hi. Morning! How far down the list did you get? Um, I got to the letter g in my phone, but before we get into that, wow, look at you, you like it? I love it. What's the occasion? Nothing. I just needed a little boost to keep the engines going, you know? Okay. Oh, and Darcy Hawkins is coming by to sign the paperwork. You like him! Don't be ridiculous. Are you going out with him? Gina, please. We are business partners. Mm-hm. - Sort of. - Mm-hm. - Temporarily. - Okay. Where's the permit paperwork? Oh. It is right here. Good, because he is going to be here any minute. Mm-hm. With chocolates and flowers. Gina, for the love of... Hello. Hi. Oh, yeah. The paperwork. - Right. Yes. - Mm-hm. Thanks. You can, uh, just sign where the stickies are and that should do it. Sounds good. Do you have a pen? Oh, yes. Mm-hm. - Here you go. - Thanks. You can... you can just leave it on my desk when you're done. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey, uh, what are you doing right now? Now? Oh. Um, I think I have a meeting. It's been cancelled. - What? - Yeah, they just called. They pushed it to next week, yeah. Well in that case, there's something I could use your help with. It's for the market. Oh, um... I don't know. The rest of my day is pretty busy. I've gotta talk to some of the vendors, then line up a Santa. All taken care of. In fact, you are free for the day. Well then. I guess I'm free. Perfect. What are you doing in there? Darcy: You'll see. We're going to get a Christmas tree. Oh. You said you wanted one for the market. I was just thinking about getting a fake one. Ah, you can't do that. It's not the same. You know, we really don't have to go through all this trouble. Where's the fun in that? Come on. It's a Hawkins tradition. Better than a board meeting, though, right? Absolutely so, you and gran go out like this every year? Oh yeah. You should see gran with a saw. So, what's the toboggan for? Well we have to drag the tree back somehow. Oh, and the best trees are at the bottom of the hill. Are you serious? Well, if gran can do it, you can. Sure, there's a few shrubs to avoid, couple icy patches, but it'll be fine. Right. Oh, uh, ladies first. Okay. You know what? Actually, let me just... Woo! Yes! You liar! Come on. It's my turn. Wasn't so bad, right? Alright, alright. Let me show you how it's done. Oh, okay. Yeah. Alright. Yeah! Woo! Show off! That's how it's done! ♪ ♪ - All right, ready? - Yeah. Uh, back that way a little bit more? - This way? Okay. - Mm-hm. Nope. Too far. Back that way. Uh, back the other way. Yeah, yeah. - How's that? - Yeah. Almost there. Maybe back that way a little bit. Towards you. That's good. Ah, wow. That is a tree. Yeah. You know what would make it look even better? - What? - Decorations. Mm. Where did all this come from anyway? I told Gina to put in an order for some Christmas decorations, but this is next level. It's great. We can start with these. ♪ So, what do you and your family do at christmastime? You guys have any traditions? Oh, yeah. All the classics. Hot chocolate, movies. Cookies for Santa. Of course. My mom was very into Christmas. That's actually how I came up with this whole market idea. Really? Yeah, yeah. We used to go to one every year outside of town. We'd buy all sorts of things from all the shops. I would make her take me on the sleigh ride over and over. - Sleigh ride, huh? - Oh, yeah. Yeah. Some kids love rollercoasters, not me. I was all about that horse and buggy. Mm-hm. The cold night air. The bright Christmas lights. Even the sound of the horses breathing. I just... I loved it all. Should we plug these in? Yeah.

These were installed so long ago I wasn't even sure if they would work. You know, I was kinda joking about moving in next to gran, but now? With this out my window every day? Count me in.

Yeah, it's been a long time since I let myself enjoy all of this. It's understandable. It must be hard without your mom. I always thought that I would find new traditions to do with my own family one day. But since that hasn't happened yet, I kind of feel like I'm in this limbo. Anyway. I think it's great that you do all this with gran. I'm sure she appreciates it so much. Yeah, she does. But it is nice having a new face around here. ♪ What? I kinda think we should dance.

Okay. Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for coming. I know it's been a bit of a bumpy road to get here, so thank you for keeping the faith. The place looks incredible. I'm so happy to be here supporting all of you. You all work so hard, and you're such a big part of what makes Hawkins bay so special. I know there's a lot at stake tonight, but don't forget to take a moment to enjoy the evening, because you all deserve it. And lastly, I would like to thank the Hawkins family for their generosity in hosting us. We are so grateful. Now, without further ado, let's kick off the first annual Hawkins bay Christmas market! Gina: Hi, come on in! Hi, merry Christmas. Welcome. ♪ ♪ So, I thought I'd add a little extra oomph for tonight. What do you think? Wow. You like it? I love it. Good. That was the goal. I think it's going well in there. Yeah. I'm so relieved. You did a great job. I couldn't have done it without you, though. I find it very hard to say no to you. Lucky me. ♪ Gina: Alex. Oh sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, but I need to talk to you. What is it? I just got off the phone with Brent's office. The planning committee held a vote tonight. What? Yeah. What happened? They denied Darcy's building permit. What? But we had a meeting scheduled for the new year. I know, but I guess they just decided to go ahead anyway. I'm sorry. Thanks for letting me know. Good luck. Everything okay? Actually... There's an issue with your permit. The planning committee decided to hold a vote and, um... they opted not to approve it. What? I'm so sorry. I had no idea they were planning to do it tonight. They... they rushed the decision for some reason. Yeah. Because they never planned to approve it in the first place. No. No. No, that's not true. They're reasonable people. Let me talk to them. I'll file an appeal, we'll get this sorted out... You said the vote was only a formality. I thought it was. But you weren't sure? I told gran about the apartments... She's picking out paint colors. I am so sorry. Yeah. At least you and the town got what you wanted. No. Darcy, wait. We will figure this out, I promise. You have my word. People's word doesn't seem to mean a lot in this town. Darcy, please. Gina: Great, I'm so happy to hear that. I will definitely let her know. Okay. Thanks. Bye. So, we got some preliminary numbers in from last night. Sales were off the charts. Really? Mm-hm, and we have two more nights to go. - That's great. - Yep. Frank even gave me a hug on the way out. - I take it he sold a few big ticket items? - All the big ticket items. - What about Jo? She didn't have time to sit down all night. - I'm really happy to hear that. - I know. You did a good thing last night. I don't know about that. Main street's gonna live to see another day because of you. Hey. I got your message. Yeah, we need to talk. I heard the Christmas market was a huge success. That's good news. Yeah, thanks in large part to Darcy. What happened, Brent? The committee voted against it. Why? You and I both know there was nothing wrong with that proposal. I wouldn't say that. His environmental assessments were six years old. You can't just expect us to sign off on that. So order them to be re-done, you don't just throw it away. It's not just that. The committee was hesitant to go back into business with a Hawkins. The committee or you? Both. And if I'm being perfectly honest, I think your judgement is a little clouded on this issue. What does that mean? Come on, Alex. I'm not blind. I am thinking about the good of this town. Well, the committee disagrees. You are welcome to appeal the decision though. You know if you stand out here too long, you're gonna catch a cold. Are you okay? Doesn't seem fair. Feels like they used us. No, they didn't. They welcomed us. But your apartment... Oh, Darcy, don't worry about the apartment. There are plenty of other places to live. I'll be fine. Now, don't let the past stand in the way of your future. Okay? Not a bad place to live, huh? Not bad at all. I hear the Christmas market was a big hit. Congratulations. Not to everybody. Yeah, I heard about the committee's decision. I'm sorry it didn't go your way. You know, I just thought, after all this... people would be able to move on. Well, these things take time. Darcy was right. I got what I wanted, but what did he get? I let him down. Again. For what it's worth, you were right about him. He's not his father. If anyone made a mistake, it was me. You have faith in people, no matter what. And that's what makes you so good at this job. You're a better mayor than I ever was. Dad. No, no, no, no, no, no. I mean it. Yeah, I know I taught you a lot, but you bring your mother's heart into it. I know she'd be proud so of you. I certainly am. So, then why does it still feel like I failed? Because you care about him. And maybe it's not too late. What do you mean? Well, just because the vote's been taken doesn't mean the paperwork's been filed yet. What? Building permits don't get put into the system until the end of the week. So, until it gets filed... It's not set in stone. Still a chance to change their minds. You really are a genius, dad. 25 years on the job you learn a few things. Thank you. Go get 'em, honey. I will. Love you. Love you! Brent: Alright, that sounds like a great idea. We'll take a look at that in the new year. Alright, everyone, I guess that pretty much wraps us up. Wait! Mayor foster? What are you doing here? I need to talk to you all. Hi, everyone. We're just finishing up. It's our last day before the holidays. I know, but this is important. It's about the Hawkins mill. We've already voted on that. I know, but I'm not sure it was given the appropriate consideration. As you may have heard, the Christmas market opened up last night and so far it has exceeded our expectations. Yes, but it's only temporary. Exactly, but it doesn't have to be. Think about what opening the mill year round could do for economic growth. Not only would it be the permanent home for the Christmas market, but it could also host other events, like conferences and weddings. Not to mention new businesses, new residents, and new infrastructure. This is exactly what Hawkins bay needs. The only hesitation I'm sensing here is about the name on the paper. Look, I understand. This town has been through a lot over the years and it's only natural for some of us to be wary. But think about the opportunity we have here. What it would symbolize for our town. A fresh start, a new chapter, a chance to move forward together. Good speech. It's what I believe. So, what do you say? Will you reconsider? Hi, Ruby. Alex? Hi, Mrs. Hawkins. Is Darcy here? Oh. No, I'm sorry, dear. He's not. He left a little while ago. Do you know where he went? I'm afraid not. Well, listen, about the apartments... Oh, don't worry about that. Anywhere I can get a hot cup of tea, a fresh deck of cards, and my knitting, I'm good. Well, it won't have to be just anywhere. What? What's this? The renovations for the mill got approved. How wonderful. Thank you. You're welcome. And, please, tell Darcy... Thank you for everything. I will. And Alex? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. ♪ Alex, there you are. Look at this place! It's busier than last night. I'm so glad, Jo. Do you think it's enough? Are you gonna be okay? More than okay. Any luck with Darcy? Um, no. I'm sorry, Alex. I just wish he was here to see all the good he's done. Who's done? Darcy. What do you mean? I just saw him. What? Yeah, he's outside. Really? Yeah. Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! ♪ Hi. You came back. Well, I do own the building. Yes, you do. About that... No, no. I overreacted. I shouldn't have left like that. I'm so sorry. Don't apologize. I would have felt the same way. But you should know... The permit's been approved. - Really? - Yeah. How did you... I talked to the board. Better late than never. You really don't give up do you? Darcy. No matter what happens after this... I just wanted to say thank you. Not just for the Christmas market, but for our time together. This past week with you. I've had more fun and felt more joy than I have since I was a kid. And I didn't know how badly I needed to feel like that again. So... Thank you. You know... I'd convinced myself that if I kept my world small, just me and gran and Ruby, that would be enough. And then you came stomping up to my front door. I did not stomp. Oh, you were stomping. Then everything changed. Thing is, I don't know what I'm gonna do because I don't think I can go back. I don't want to go back. So, if it's alright with you... I'd like to stick around. I think that can be arranged. Come on. There's something I wanna show you. What?! How? I had to drive two counties over to get them. That's where you went? Turns out it's a tough time of year to find a last minute sleigh ride. Come on. Hey, boy. How you doing? Hi. I can't believe you did this. People are going to love it. I hope so... but the first ride's for you. Thank you. Merry Christmas.
