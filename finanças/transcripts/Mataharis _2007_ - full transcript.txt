I see. But how many people were at that meeting? Someone must have talked. The spectrum analysis showed there weren't any mikes in the room. - That's not an expense. - I know. I know, but our technicians are sure there's nothing there. All right, I'll send them back and they can do another sweep. All right. Bye. The guy in Getafe. He insists his office phone's tapped. Who would ever want to tap his phone? In his dreams. - Did you get anything? - Everything. At a luxury restaurant too. The works. Who's in there? Ferran's brought in a new case. Something big... theft. Maybe an undercover job. - Did he say who'll be covering it? - No, but they'll want a guy. Carmen, tell him I'll do it. Try and persuade him, please. For you it's Getafe for now. - Right now? - Yes. But I haven't been home for 3 days! My cat could be dead. And anyway, I'm meeting someone. Tell Eva to go. Eva. Hi! Hi. Hello, Mummy. Come here. Come here, Fatty. Mummy has to go. - Why? - Daddy will give you supper. - I'll read you a story later. - Okay. Nico's asleep. Sara's supper's almost ready. Don't give Nico his bottle any later than 9 o'clock. And don't fill the bath tub too full. Okay. I'll try and be back by ten, okay? Weren't we going out for a meal? It's Friday, Eva. I do what I can. - Yeah... - Okay? Look at this. One of them's fantastic. I've marked it. Okay? - See you later. - Bye. Anyway... There's a little work I need to finish off. Okay. Mercury's in the seventh house, which means you're currently taking some important decisions but you have reservations. Is that right? Sure. People wouldn't do astral charts otherwise. Yes, you're taking decisions regarding the home. With changes inside the house, maybe even changing the house itself... Half the country's selling homes and the other half's buying so... Talking to me? No. To that guy. Mercury is the planet of the home, so it adds up. May things go well in this new phase in your life. The kids? Asleep. Want some supper? Okay. All there was was pasta. Yes, I know. Eva? Eva... Where have you been? - They're waiting. - Have they been here long? I want everything cleaned up... Right then. Now Ines has been with us for 3 years, right? - Hello, Ines. - Hello. - Long time no see. - Yes. Sit down. Pretty and one of our best agents. Experience in internal services, she has a degree, of course, and what they didn't teach her at university she's learning from me. Anyway, these gentlemen have a problem with two workers. There have been thefts at one of their plants. Could be on a large scale. You'll go in under cover and get what you can on those two guys. Okay? Right. So the ball's rolling. We'll email you a contract and have a report on those two ready in a month's time. - I hope so. - I'll see you out. - Right, keep us informed. - I'll call you. - Let us know. - Fine. We'll be in touch. Carmen, draw up a contract and don't be shy with the expense account. And you'd better do a good job. I want a report on those two every day. Stick close to them. Screw them if you have to. I want to know everything they do, they say, they eat... Yes, but once I'm in, I'll need... Once you're in, you'll do whatever you need to do. And careful, Ines. This isn't about adultery or that kind of shit. It's a multinational. It's serious stuff, well-paid, a great new contact. Don't screw up or I'll kill you. Now get to work. Come here. Look. This is the part-time agency they work with. Go along today. Their personnel officer will offer you the job right away. Understand? Good luck. We alternate between the workshops and the offices. Today it's the offices. That's the toilets, changing rooms... Watch out. - Go on. - There's a lot of traffic. Right. Don't go beyond that yellow line without your special boots. Are you listening, new girl? I always go over it... You have to clean the desks, empty the wastepaper bins, wipe the computers. Don't even touch those bits of yellow paper. Empty the bins... We don't do the windows at the moment but the way things are going, we'll probably end up doing their food for the same price too. - Understand? - Yes. Good. Good afternoon. Here. You stay here, girls, and I'll go on with Ines. Okay. See you later. Don't worry, I'll bring the water. Look, you're one of the team. You can't... No, you can't not turn up. We need someone on the left wing. No, Gordo's useless and always lets us down. No, Pera won't be there and neither will Sapo. I don't want any excuses, Salva. Come on Sunday or you'll be reprimanded and fined. I'm not in at the moment. Please leave a message. Hey, sweetie. It's me. Are you there? Ines. Are you there? Okay then... Call me when you can, okay? Kiss kiss. Come on, Sara, let's go. Eva... If you're in a hurry, go on. No, it's on my way to the office. He feels really hot. Is he okay? He's fine. You'll make me nervous. Let me see. Have a look. He's really hot. They won't take him at nursery school like this. - Take him to the doctor's. - Great. Sara, come on! I only just started back at work! They won't mind just this once. Call them, it'll be okay. You call your boss and tell him you're with the baby. It's not the same thing. No, of course not! How could I think such a thing? Come home at midday and I'll go in to work for a while. Midday? I can't... I've got a business lunch. Come on, let's go. - I'll call you later. - Bye, sweetie. Let's go. Here it is... I'd like an appointment, please. Yes, Dr. Llanos. "Lunch, Marta, 2.30." Pardon? Thank you. Marta... 44, Conception Avenue. Who the hell is Marta? With all the restaurants in Madrid, he had to take her there, where we always celebrate our anniversary. That was Saturday the 12th, in West Park. With us it was always "work, work, work". But look how nice he is to her kids. I'll talk to you later. Turn that off, please. - Right. - I've seen enough. Just a moment and I'll give you all the papers. No, that's all right. I'll come back some other time and... This is the bill. What are you doing there? Off you go. - Hello. - Hi, gorgeous. - How you doing? - Fine. You? - Fine. - Good. - Like a drink? - I'll have a beer. Okay. Long time no see. Why haven't you called me? I've been really busy. Busy? Okay, so... Fancy some supper? I already had a snack but... - It's no big deal. - We said we'd have supper together! - Let's move on to dessert. - No. And you always do this to me. - I can still eat anything. - Shit... - An appetizer now, and then... - Asshole. Now don't get like that. - Finished your toast, darling? - Yes. Good. Come here. That's it, Fatty. Eva, there aren't any towels! Look in the wardrobe. You can see the red. Here, Mummy. I did this. I just finished. It's for you. It's lovely, darling. - Somebody called you. - Did they? It was... the people from the gym. They're going biking on Saturday. And you want to go? If you don't mind. Come on up, come on! I can stay in with the kids on Sunday and you can go out. So who's going? Same gang as always. Jose, Alberto, Antonio. You know. Kiss kiss. Bye, darling. Off you go. Come on, darling, we're going now. - Shall I take them? - No. Okay. Give me a kiss, Fatty. Bye. Bye. Get your bag. How long was he there? About four hours. Four hours? He told me he took three photos and then went home. Then... Yes, he went to the other wedding. Isn't that another day? It was the same evening. What a bastard! He said, "I took three photos and went home." Shit, it's Sofia! - His girlfriend? - No. My wife. She works with us. She knew I was there? No. You didn't tell your wife you hired me? No. When I said I thought my partner was working on his own, she said I was paranoid. Sure, but if you want to prove he's been lying to you, we need to catch him at least once more. Otherwise he could say he was doing a friend a favour or something. Okay. But what was Sofia doing there? I'll find out if you like. Look... It won't affect us all in the same way and it'll be gradual, but what the company's saying is tighten your belts or a lot of jobs will be lost. Nothing new there. This happens all the time. They outsource services, save on expenses, and it's all within the law. Just a minute, just a minute. It's within the law if the need to do it is justified, if we didn't offer those services but that's not the case. They want to outsource services we already give. They want to subcontract you to do the work you do now but in worse conditions. No, what the company wants is to be competitive and not to lose our jobs. No, Miriam. They want to cut costs on pay rises and seniority increments. To replace indefinite contracts with temporary ones. You'll lose your health care. They'll lose their collective agreement for a much worse one. They'll outsource whether we like it or not. We need to get the best conditions we can for you. - So that's your proposal? - You got a better one? Yes. We get organized and block all outsourcing. Don't be stupid, Manuel. The only thing that'll do is lose these people their jobs. Some already have lost their jobs. But you sold out. What the hell are you doing on the works council? I don't have to take this. Listen to these clowns if you like, but things could get much worse. Why? Because they stand up for themselves and seek advice? They can't be fired for that. I'm going to see what those say. Mummy, there aren't any squids in the bath tub, are there? No, my love. Or meteorites either? No, my love. Or snails? No. Or... waves? No. The waves are in the sea. Or sharks? No, there aren't any sharks either. Hi! Hi, Sara. Come here. What are you doing? - Kiss? - Drawing. - Can I see? - Yes. Let's go then. - Hi. - Hi. Let's see. Look. That's great. What's this? - And who's that? - Me. And this one with the beard? You. Me? With a beard? Have I got a beard? Oh dear. What's the matter? What is it, beautiful? Aren't you happy? Know what we're going to do? I'm going to put you in the kitchen in the sun. That'll cheer you up. Alberto, - I'm going to bed. - I'll be right in. When I went away, I was sure I'd go back but I didn't. She came from a republican family and when I managed to go back years later, I couldn't pluck up the courage to go and see her because I thought she'd probably got married to someone else by then. I see. Or that she wouldn't love me any more. Do you understand? I think so. So what exactly do you want to find out? What became of her? You see... My wife died two years ago. And I'm very lonely. And... I've been doing a lot of thinking, thinking about her... And I thought that if by any chance... - she were lonely too... - I see. So... Have you asked in the village? Yes, but there aren't any relatives of hers there any more. That's why I've come to see you. In case you can find her. And this photo's all you've got? And her name. Amparo Redondo Solis. We'll see what we can do. But with only a photo and a name - I can't promise anything. - I understand. When I have something I'll let you know. - All right. - Okay? - You're very kind. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Bye. Hello? I need the number of someone who lives at 44, Conception Avenue, called Marta, no surname. There's no Marta? Okay, thank you. Has Gramps gone? He's been to the village but it's still the best place to start. Shall I go or will you? Eva? Shall I go or will you? I'll go. The only trouble is Iñaki's going away this weekend and he'll need the car. Take mine if you like. What about the kids? Want me to look after them? Thanks. - Hi! - Hi. All right? Fine. Are you? Some coffee? All right. Any luck? Not with the thefts. But they're having a lot of meetings. There's a farewell party for someone who's being retired off tonight. I've come for the hidden camera. This rumba, dedicated to a gypsy... There was Adela and Fernando, Manuel... And that Miriam, and she was as stubborn as a mule about it. Manuel said with enough workers they could stop the outsourcing. Did you hear that? Well, I think that Manuel - is all talk. - I fancy him. Do you? Look, sweetie... It's easy to make a fuss when you're single with no kids and no responsibilities but let me tell you, if you keep going to those meetings, - you'll get fired. - We have every right to be informed. They'll get you into a real mess. Didn't they say they'd take you on again? - Yes. - Then what do you care - whether it's a subcontract or not? - I don't know... You're depressing me. Want another drink? I still have some left. So tell me all about it. I don't feel like it. I just want to have a quiet drink. Hello. Hello. Get me a beer? Yeah, sure. Excuse me. Another beer. Here. Thanks. I can't manage. Give me a hand? Sure. That's it. We have to do it now. Hi. Move over, guys. I say we should each make an individual complaint. That'd stop them, damn it! - Three complaints won't stop anybody. - No, but fifty will. - Here we go again! - We can't negotiate individually, each with his contract and his problems... Do you come from Madrid? No. From a village. Monforte de Lemos. See what the works council says about the complaints. We'll do it without them. They're useless. Did you come here to study? Yes. Journalism. For all the good it did me. I've been getting 2 and 3-month contracts for 3 years. At the last place, it was the same... Outsourcing and out of a job. So show me the way to the barricades. Fernando, here's a volunteer - for the revolution. - Good. Now let's all sing. It's about time you changed the subject. - I can't sing... - Sing with me. Come on. No. Let me cross the wind without papers. I'll do it for the times we had together. There's no way out, you look asleep, I could spend my whole life looking for that smile of yours. I want to be the only one to kiss your mouth, I want to know that life with you will never end. Yes, I do, I do, I do. In this life I couldn't bear to spend a whole day without you. Come on! Careful, darling. Will you...? Careful. Go in front, go in front. Go on. - Hi. - Kiss. Let me tell you... - The milk, the cereals... - Right. - Napkins, their tea, everything. - Perfect. - Will you manage with both of them? - Of course I will. Some things you don't forget. Like riding a bike. - Have a good trip. - Thanks a lot. - That's okay. Off you go. - Bye. Where is he going? - Who is it? - It's me. - Yes? - Who is it? Yes? Sorry to bother you. I'm from the café in the park. They know you. Apparently your husband left this behind when he was with the little boy. Just a minute. Sweetie! Did you go - to the bar? - Yes. Come here. Are these your dad's glasses? I don't know. They said they belonged to the man who was with him. Will you give them to your dad? Okay. When he comes back, okay? That's right. When he comes back. - Thanks a lot. - That's all right. Goodbye. Hi. I thought you'd be asleep. How did it go? Fine. Very good. How was the new bike? Fine. We went all the way to La Pedriza. Wow, all the way to La Pedriza. This... having two families... How long's it been going on? What? - The two... - I haven't got two families. So what do you do with the kid in Zaragoza? Sponsor him? You followed me? - You've got a nerve. - You did? And you've been... You spied on me? And you've been lying to me, damn it! Who is that kid? Who is that woman? Why have you never told me about her? I want an explanation, please. Eva... Marta and I were together for a time some years ago. She got pregnant, I didn't want the baby but she said she'd have it anyway. We broke up and I hadn't seen her since then. - And you never once told me? - There was nothing to tell, Eva. - I first saw him 2 months ago. - Two months? - You've been going there for 2 months? - 4 or 5 times in all. That's all. Marta told me he wanted to meet me. What could I do? And her? What does she want? Nothing. She just wants me to see the boy. The boy must have a name, right? He must have a name! Javi. Javi. Have you got a son called Javi? - I'm sorry. Really sorry. - Shit. I should have told you but I couldn't find the right time. I couldn't find the right time. Really. When did you think you'd find it? When the kid was 18 and turned up here for a visit? What else haven't you told me? - Mummy, I want some water. - I'll go. Ines! Ines! I put this together. Take a look at it if you like, give the girls one. Explain it to them. People don't like reading. Okay. Okay? Good. Hey, Manuel. I found this. It might interest you. What is it? Isn't that the firm they're going to subcontract? Where did you get this? From the shredder. People are so careless. They taught you that at college? It's about the kind of contract they want people to sign. Temporary ones. Would you have to sign one too? No. This doesn't affect department managers. So why all the interest in this? Have a beer with me after work and I'll tell you. And I thought union people were all bad-tempered loudmouths! And I thought cleaners all painted their nails and chewed gum. - I'm not a cleaner. - And I'm not a union man. I don't even belong to a union. So why are you on the works council? It was a bit by chance. They needed sixteen reps and had all the places covered except two, which they put my name and another poor devil's down for, thinking we'd just go along and keep quiet. - Here? - Yes. Do you understand? No. Look, the more reps a union has on councils, the more cash they get from the state. So they make a pact with the company and choose docile union members and everybody's happy. Well, almost everybody, because people like you and Adela pay the price. But what annoyed me was the number of people they're fucking up just because they're stronger or what they do is within the law. And so it's "take it or leave it". If you leave it, then you get nothing and that's scary. But the real question is: How much are we prepared to put up with to keep our jobs? How much would we sacrifice to get our pay slip at the end of the month? We give them our time, our sweat, our soul... but in exchange for what? Nothing on the thefts? Write a negative report on the thefts but include all the outsourcing stuff. But they didn't ask for that. Didn't they? Are you sure? Telling us to go around following union reps would look terrible for them. So they tell you some story about thefts and... Let them pay for this report and if they want to get rid of the union reps they can ask for another and you go back, okay? Okay. And when I mentioned the outsourcing to them... - What? - Well... - What? - It's what they really want. Of course! I knew it. So what do they want? The manager wants enough proof to fire Manuel and his friend but want to know who else is involved. Great. So you stay in and we'll tap that Andres's office line... Manuel's. Sure, Manuel. We'll set up some outside support... Right, that's it. So what's your impression? They'd do anything to save their outsourcing plan. Fine. So we'll squeeze them dry. We'll draw up a new contract and Carmen can give the outside support. Good job. Carmen, we're going to milk that multinational. Draw up a new contract and include Ines, the tap on Manuel's phone and the outside support to follow this... Manuel. He seems to be the ringleader. Okay? - What amount shall I put? - 30,000. - I can't see a thing. - I know. Sorry, technology isn't my thing. They might just be talking. Well... no. No? Why not? Well, because... I've been in this for years. It's something you just know. It's... it's the way they look at each other, the way they talk... I mean, it's obvious. That's my partner's place. Sergio, are things okay with your wife and you? Yes, damn it! We haven't seen each other much lately, but yes. - What about them? - They're just friends. They've worked together for a long time but that doesn't mean... - Sergio. - It just can't be, Carmen! It just can't be. It can't be. Look, let's get this straight. Do you really want the truth? I can go on with this for as long as you like but if you won't open your eyes, there is nothing I could show you. They're probably covering a wedding in Peñiscola on Saturday. This Saturday? That'll cost you more. Want me to go? Okay. Carmen? What? - I want to go too. - No. No way. Nobody need know. - No, I can't do that. - Carmen, please. I promise I'll just watch. - No. - Look, - I talked to Sofia. - And? She denied it all. I can see this but at the same time... I need to see it with my own eyes. Sergio, don't complicate things for me. Please, Carmen. I'll only watch. I may have to go away this weekend. I hope not, especially since our daughter's coming. She's not. She said she had work to do and was staying in London. When did she ring? I don't know... I suppose it was... two days ago. I forgot to tell you. Right. What a pity. How long have you been in this? Ten years, more or less. Do you like it? Sometimes it can be nice. Is this nice? Not very much, no. I always say when in doubt it's always easier and cheaper to talk to your partner. More important than whether there's somebody else is the reason why. There they are. I'm sorry. It's unbelievable. Your whole life with somebody and you've no idea what they think, what they do, what they want. And you sit down every day at the same table together to... have lunch or supper or watch TV... But you're in different places. You know why? Yes. Because... you stop caring or they stop caring about you. Then one day you stop touching each other. With your hands or even with words. Shall we dance? You won't admit that you're taking advantage of me, controlling me with that radar of yours... Did I step on your feet? No, no. It's just... I haven't danced for a long time. Neither have I. I'm not that story with no end any more. And you know all too well that this can't be. I won't play any more if I'm only going to lose. I won't cry any more over what I lost... that love that burns me up, that light that blinds me. And there's nothing to ease my suffering. A last drink? No. You have one if you like. I'm going back to my room. See you tomorrow. Bye. That love that burns me up, that light that blinds me. And there's nothing to ease my suffering. It's just too much. It's too much. He's not going in or coming out or anything. When his folks were here at Christmas, he'd already met the boy. And when we were house-hunting as well. It's just too much. Stop torturing yourself. Stop torturing yourself. And don't be so hard on him. I mean, meeting your 10-year-old son... He shouldn't have had him. Eva, you're the one he's had children with. - He has one with her too. - It's not the same. The one with her is his biological child. But his decision was to have a family with you. That's what I thought but I'm not so sure any more. Look, Eva... Is this about him having a son or not telling you about it? It's about him lying to me once so why not again? He didn't lie to you. He just didn't tell you something. Everyone's entitled to their secrets, aren't they? Not talking about your past... that's not lying. And if he's having an affair with her? He told you he wasn't. So why didn't he tell me before? I guess he was waiting for the right time. The right time? Time... Since Nico was born I haven't had any time for myself. The right time! No, don't laugh. I just feel that... I don't really know him. MARTA: CAN YOU COME? MARTA: REALLY IMPORTANT Mummy, I've finished. Do you want a yoghurt? No. All right. - Hi. - Hi, Daddy. What are you doing, darling? Have you had your supper? It's from "The Jungle Book". Great! Are you doing it again? Eva, I'm going to see Javi on Saturday. Again? Yes. His team's playing and he wants me to go. What's his team? Zaragoza. All right... fine. So will you see him every weekend? What does she say? I don't know... what I'm going to do. And it's not that serious either. He lives in Zaragoza, we live here. This shouldn't need to affect you so badly, damn it! And Nico and Sara? Do they have a brother or don't they? Why does she email you all the time? - Tell me. - All she does is tell me about Javi. You shouldn't read my mail. I have to find out about things some way. But what do you want to know? What? Ask me anything you like, damn it! Ask! Are you having an affair with her? No. But you wanted to? Maybe, but I didn't, Eva. I didn't. Damn it! Look, Eva, please... What is the matter with you? Look, I'm here. With you. What's wrong? I just don't know if I can trust you any more, honey. I just don't know. Let's see... This... Isn't that noisy in the morning? Really noisy. Pass me the tape? Sit there and look. Is it okay there? Yes. That's it. Which one's Manuel? The one in white. He's cute. Right... that's that. I'll position the mike. So what's this Manuel like? Manuel? Normal. How else would he be? Just a moment, please! Just a moment, please! This is important. Let me explain. You're all going to sue the company. Each one individually. How do you do that? I'll tell you. I'll give you all the statement to sign and we'll submit the complaints - all together. - Is that clear? Imagine the front pages: "100 workers sue their firm". We'll meet outside the court and tip off the press. - I have a question. - Quiet, please. Why does it have to be a hundred? There are over 60 of us here. Isn't that enough? Well... 100 is a symbolic number and technically speaking such a number will overwhelm them with red tape and the company may prefer to settle with you all out of court rather than being snowed under with paperwork. So we have to try and persuade more people. I'm sure that between us all we'll manage. Now fill in your details and sign the complaint. See you outside the court house. Dress up for the photo. Good luck! The Arena rooms tomorrow night at 9.30. For another meeting? No. A "Rosendo" concert. Absolutely indispensable. - I can't... - No. No arguing, Ines. I'm sorry, Manuel, I... - Manuel. - Tomorrow. We need to find another 40 people. You paid for the tickets too. That doesn't count. It's money well spent. Is there such a thing as "money badly spent"? - Sure. - Really? - Do you spend well or badly? - Me. I don't know. Can I tell you a secret? I have between 2 and 4 business lunches every month. Business lunches always last two hours but you only talk business for 10 minutes. You talk to each other and discover that one likes golf, another video games, another has a lover... So we decided to sort out the business stuff quickly then go home. So what do you do with that time? I go to the cinema. The first performance, at 4.30, on my own. With the money from the meals I buy shirts for my team. But they're useless and we never win, with or without shirts. But that's my life. You've got a cheek. Best to spend money on the things you like. - Another drink? - Yes. Okay, I'll get one. Good evening, Madrid! Quick, it's starting! Don't think I'm sad if you never see me smile. I'm just miles away, that's the way I am. Manuel, I'm leaving. Now? Why? Don't you feel well? No, well... not too good. You stay if you like. Okay? No, I'll come with you. That's the way I am. I'll come with you. You don't need to, really. Till you get a taxi. I'm crossing the calender at the same speed... Did I say something? No, really. I just have to go. Manuel, I'm going. But why? I really have to go. I wouldn't worry too much. People don't like going to court. And your partner would lose this one anyway. Okay. Have you talked to your wife? No. I don't know how to. The business is one thing, and we're another. I see. - Anyway, I must be going. Okay? - Okay. I hope it works out. Thanks for everything, Carmen. Everything. If you decide to go to court, you'll have to call me to confirm my report. You really like it, don't you? Let Daddy put the towel around you. Come on. And up! Hold him tight. Good. Want to go house-hunting this weekend? What about Zaragoza? I decided not to go. I don't know if I feel like looking at houses if I don't know if it's for 4 or 5 or 6. How long are you going to keep this up? I don't know. I can't help it. - What's the trouble? - The trouble is that I feel like I've been cheated. All on my own looking after the kids all day, and then on top of it... Only because you want it like that. Thanks. No. I just can't do anything with you, Eva. You haven't let me do a thing since Nico was born. You should have said so before. I need some help. Why didn't you say something? And you didn't need to go back to work so soon. You seem to think you're Superwoman. What else otherwise? Not work for 2 years like when Sara was born? It was difficult going back and I don't want that to happen again. And without my salary we'll never - buy a house. - A house. You take all the decisions... If I didn't, nobody else would. See to the baby. You never let me try. Maybe I'd do things differently or whatever, but I can do them. When? Instead of your meetings or your lunches with your boss, or when you come home from the gym? How many times have you taken Nico or Sara to the doctor? Or to the park or to find a nursery? Where do we keep the kid's clothes? You don't even know where the towels are. Okay, so I hate the park, I'm useless and you're Miss Perfect, but it's important to me to do things. You have your way, I have mine. Like going to Zaragoza once a month to see your 10-year-old son? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Iñaki. Iñaki. Why don't you go away for a time? Just till we've worked things out. If we go on like this, all we'll do is hurt each other. You want us to separate? Is that what you want? You want me to go? To rent a room and only see the kids at weekends? Or you go and we say Mummy and Daddy don't love each other any more and you take them Friday and bring them back Sunday? Is that what you want? Why the hell is this shit so big, damn it! Because it's Sara's. - Hi. - Hi. You mentioned the cinema too? Carmen, I'm dropping this case. Dropping the case? - Why? - Because. I don't like it. That company lied to us. That guy has every right to do what he's doing. The company also has every right to look out for its interests. All Manuel's trying to do is get decent contracts for those people, to save their jobs. Look, Ines, companies do that all the time nowadays. Fine. Well, I won't help them. Look, Ines... Do you want this job? Yes, but we aren't... No buts. We provide services to people who pay for them and we don't take sides. Drop the case if you like. Someone else will always do it. But you should decide if you want to stay in this profession. Remember what you said when you came here? No. Well, I do. You said it was your vocation, it was like a dream come true working here in Madrid. So now what? Are you going to throw all that away? Have you had supper? Yes. What about you? I had a snack. Shall we go to bed? You go. I'll be right in. YOUR WIFE AND FAMILY WILL NEVER FORGET YOU - You found her! - Let me tell you about it. Right... Yes...? Well, her husband died some years ago. She lives in Guadalajara with her daughter. Sit down. I've got the address and phone number. You can ring her. But I... I don't know if I dare. Then write her a letter. That's less embarrassing than just turning up or calling her. But I left the village when I was young and never went back - for her. - I see... I did write her a letter once but I couldn't pluck up the courage to send it. You never told her why you didn't go back? Why not? How could I tell her that my parents had forbidden me to go back and I'd never dared to disobey them? I was really ashamed of that. Understand? Yes. So I was thinking that you might go and find her and ask her if she'll see me. Is that alright with you? It's alright with me. Mummy, come here. Look. What is it? Pictures. This one's for you, this one's for Daddy, this one's for Nico and this one's for Javi. Javi? Who's Javi, darling? My brother in Zaragoza. And who are they? This is Daddy, this is you, this is Javi, this is me, this is Nico. Yes. Right. If we hear they're going to sue you, we'll let you know right away. The girl's smart, believe me. She won't miss a trick. First thing tomorrow there'll be a report on your desk with... No, of course not. That's in the contract. No problem. Where's Ines? Why wasn't I told about the lawsuit? No idea, Emilio. Ask Carmen. Tell her I want to talk to her right away. And I want Ines's report on that lawsuit right away. The old man? Has he paid, not paid? Yes. I found who he was looking for. Tell him so and give him his bill. I wanted to... And I don't want to see any kids around here again. This isn't a nursery school. Be a mother at home. Here you're a detective. These things should be obvious! Is everybody stupid around here? Ines, it's me. Where are you? Valbuena wants the report from the factory. Carmen says that part of it's here but you have the rest. Bring it in or you'll be in trouble. Okay? Bye. REPORT - Shall we go in? - Yes. Well... - Come on! - Ladies and gentlemen, let's go in. Yes... Believe me I'm sorry and I do understand. I'll do something about this right away. Please accept my apologies. I'm really sorry. I'll kill that bitch! Where is she? - I don't know. - What does she think this is? A charity? I'll make sure she never gets another job in this profession again! Not even following dogs! And she owes me 30,000 euros! I'll take her to court if need be, I'll have her evicted. I'll get her! She doesn't know what she's done. And such a good contact! Such a good contact, damn it! Why didn't you come? I couldn't. How did it go? Did you make the complaint? No. It wasn't necessary. Really? They got in touch with the lawyer. They decided to settle out of court rather have 100 lawsuits on their hands. I'm really glad. Really, Manuel. What's wrong? What is it, Ines? What's the matter? - Ines? - This is for you. Here. Read it and you'll understand. What is it? What's the matter? Just read it, okay? Ines. Ines! Alberto. I'm leaving. For good. You're leaving for good? Just like that, without telling me why? Well... I mean... I don't think there's really much to say. Do you? Hi. Where are you going? To Guadalajara. To find a woman. An old flame. The kids? With my mother. I thought maybe we could talk. This is a present from Sara for Javi. This one's Javi. And this is from me. I'm sorry, Eva. I should have told you long ago. I thought you'd think it was awful and wouldn't understand. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. I should have listened more. I should have asked you. I won't demand any more explanations. I promise. Can I go with you? Where to? Wherever you're going... To work... Now? Yes. Sure.
