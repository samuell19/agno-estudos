Hi everyone. I'm Jinx Monsoon. And welcome to my gracious drawing room. And I'm here to introduce Waxie Moon in "Fallen Jewel". One of the best movies you'll ever see, ever. [laughter] This movie has everything: original music, burlesque, boy-lesque...um dancing, fun, frivolity, romance, the devil! It's got just about everything in it as well as some of Seattle's favorite queer performers. Waxie Moon himself, BenDeLaCreme, um, yours truly, Sarah Rudinoff and Keira McDonald who aren't queer but we like 'em anyway. Inga Ingenue, Lou Henry Hoover, Nick Garrison, Jackie Hell the list goes on and on ladies and gentlemen. Seattle has quite a bit of talent to work with. The best thing about this movie is it is unlike anything you've ever seen before. It's got that right balance of cult appeal and just enough charm, sass and wit to keep you in your seat begging for more. [laughter] Which is how most of my audiences are except um, they are actually begging for less. Um, but it's the opposite with this movie, you know you can't get enough. Another wonderful charming aspect of this cult hit is that is has monthly screenings here in the Northwest and throughout the country I'm sure, eventually if not yet. [laughing] You know I actually hosted the first one you know being a you know little character in the movie myself. Waxie Moon and I performed a touching and charming tribute to Bette Midler in "The Rose". So look for a cult screening near you or come to Seattle for one of our monthly screenings of this quaint and very unique little film. [laughter] Of course any flick by Wes Hurley is a flick worth being flung. So flick it, stick it, lick it. I don't care. Just pop your popcorn, pour your gin and settle down ready to watch Waxie Moon in "Fallen Jewel". Good night my babies and have a wonderful evening. * * Only if I could freeze that moment in time * * Before I had to make this choice * * In a blink of an eye, everything I knew * * Slipped away... WAXIE (VO): Seattle, Washington. The emerald city, the Oz of the Pacific Northwest. A place, not only of courage, brains and heart, but also coffee, salmon and Savage love. WAXIE: And, while yes, as a gender-blending queer lady boylesque performance-art solo stripping sensation, I do occasionally wear ruby slippers, for me, there's no place like home. WAXIE (VO): It is also home to my three best friends. Meet Marya, a high-powered lawyer and surgeon. MARYA: I object! WAXIE (VO): She's always working on a case. WAXIE (VO): Next there is Polly. As the owner of a darling bakeshop she knows that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.. And then of course there's Sahara. A woman in charge SAHARA: Well, of course I can. Mr. Businessman. I'll have three girls in cheerleading outfits with three cases of lubricant in your hotel room within the hour. Credit card number, please. * WAXIE (VO): And then there is me, Waxie Moon. * One sunny Seattle morning the girls and I met at our favorite brunch spot - Café Flora - to discuss our favorite subject... POLLY: Men! WAXIE: I love the rugged outdoorsy look of Seattle men. MARYA: Me, too, but that strong independent type can be difficult to penetrate. SAHARA: Penetrate? I love penetrating a man. It's called pegging. I prefer doggy style... WAXIE: No Sahara, by penetrate, we mean get to know. SAHARA: Oh. Well there are other ways to penetrate a man. POLLY: Sahara, you always take it the extra inch. SAHARA: Don't you mean extra inches? MARYA: OK, back to topic. Yes, I mean get to know. Seattle men are difficult to get to know. POLLY: You know why that is? Men who are attracted to Seattle want an urban environment but they also want their space. SAHARA: It's true. I mean, this is such a great city. We're a major metropolitan and we have tons of gorgeous space, green space, with trees and everything. Cock. WAXIE: Yes but that's the kind of men you meet. Someone who's kind of like hi-it's-really-nice-to - meet-you-but-don't-get-too- close-I-want-my-space. MARYA: Exactly. It's especially hard for a working professional career-minded woman to find available men. Sure, there are lots of attractive men out there, but who has the time? Just the other day.... JUDGE: Overruled. MARYA: I object. JUDGE: Sustained. MARYA: Thank you, your honor! HANDSOME LAWYER: Good work. Now that the case is closed would you care to have a drink with me sometime? MARYA: I don't drink coffee with the opposing team. HANDSOME LAWYER: Who said anything about coffee? Can I have your number? MARYA: All right... Ooh. Another time. I'm needed at the hospital for an emergency surgery. I'll see you around. HANDSOME LAWYER: Wait! Your helmet! WAXIE: You think it's hard? Imagine having no time and being a celebrity. Finding love seems impossible for me. Just the other day..... WAXIE: Oh, thank you. RUNNER GUY: Beautiful keys for a beautiful lady. WAXIE: Why thank you kind sir, Mr. handsome-key-handing-me-guy. RUNNER GUY: So when's your next show? PARK SEX MAN #1: Oh my god! Look! It's Waxie Moon! PARK SEX MAN #2: I love your work. PARK SEX MAN #3: Do you cum glitter? SAHARA: Men, men, men. Maybe, men are the problem. The last 45 men I had this morning couldn't even get me off. So I went to a lesbian mixer. MARYA: Sahara! You - a lesbian? SAHARA: Don't act so shocked. I'll do the occasional muff dance. So I'm at this mixer with tons of available gorgeous women. I brought the most gorgeous one home with me. * * THE MAN: Hey girls, may I join you? SAHARA: Sure, go right ahead. JACKIE HELL: Who is this, Sahara? SAHARA: Just something leftover from last night. JACKIE HELL: But you told me you were a lesbian like me? SAHARA: Sorry. But no matter how gorgeous she was I realized I just love cock too much. POLLY: Stop! Stop! Sahara, you're always talking about dirty dirty sex. You shouldn't have sex on the first date anyway! What about romance and love? Just the other day, I had my forth date with Brian. I think things are going beautifully. He's sweet, attentive, appreciative and so very romantic SAHARA: Have you had sex yet? POLLY: No! No! No! But we did have a lovely dinner. He knows how to treat a woman. Do you like that honey? Don't forget to use your napkin. Here, let me, honey. Would you like some dessert? How was that? Would you like to go see a movie tonight? Great, me, too! WAXIE (VO): Hearing about the girls' dating ordeals and thinking about my own love life got me wondering, when you're a stripper is it possible to shed all the layers and actually find true love? Can a gender-blending queer lady boylesque performance art solo stripping sensation find the man of her dreams? Or are celebrities destined to remain Sleepless in Seattle? SAHARA: ....so I was using three fingers like he asked and then I realized - he has four testicles! MARYA: So Polly, you never told us how you met Brian. POLLY: Oh, we met on Buttface. WAXIE: Buttface? What's that? MARYA: Don't tell me you don't have a Buttface profile. NICK: Ladies! No talking in class! WAXIE, POLLLY, MARYA: Sorry! POLLY: I wondered why you never Buttfaced me. WAXIE Buttface? I don't even know what you're talking about. MARYA: It's an online social networking dating service. You know I'm really surprised, but I like this Buttface. WAXIE: I don't know about the whole online dating thing... POLLY: Buttface isn't like other sites. It's simple. You just Buttload your profile, get responses and meet tons of available men. NICK: Ladies! What did I tell you? * * What power are you * Who from below * Has made me rise, * Unwillingly and slow * From beds of everlasting snow! * * * Can't you see how stiff, how stiff * * And wondrous old * Far unfit to bear the bitter cold * * I can scarcely move, * Or draw my breath, * Can scarcely move, * Or draw my breath. * Let me, let me, Let me, let me, * * Freeze again.... * Let me, let me * Freeze again to death! * Let me, let me, Let me, let me, * * Freeze again.... * to death! * * WAXIE (VO): Later on Marya was performing an emergency surgery. Surgery. MARYA: All right, we need fourteen liters of dimomalpapin. He's losing blood quickly. Connect the external aorta to the trachiatic valve of the complex carbohydrate nerve endings. MOTHER: Connection complete. MARYA: We're losing him. MOTHER: Try distancing the gallbladder from the latent lip suture. MARYA: Good idea. MOTHER: Hurry; there is very little time. MARYA: OK, I'm going ahead and making a severing incision across the oblongata palpitator. MOTHER: That's too risky. MARYA: We have no choice! The periodontal abdominal canal is blocked. MOTHER: OK, we're going in on my count - in three, two, one. MARYA: And we are clear. Good job everyone, good job. MOTHER: Nurse, go ahead and stitch him up. Good job to you, daughter. That was a tough one. Another life saved. You handled yourself so well. MARYA: Well, I learned from the best. MOTHER: Oh enough flattery. Let's clean up and go to the courthouse. MARYA: I thought you had another surgery? MOTHER: No, but speaking of heart. When is my daughter going to give me a granddaughter? MARYA: Oh mother you know I'm too busy for that. I can't even find time to meet a man. MOTHER: Well, you better make time. Your clock is running out. Tick tock tick tock. And there is more to life than just your career. MARYA: Mother I cannot believe I'm hearing this from you. You're Seattle's chief surgeon and chief justice. You've always instilled in me the value of an education and career path. MOTHER: Yeah, and I'd give it all up in a heartbeat for a fat little grandchild. MARYA: Oh, mother. WAXIE (VO): Meanwhile across town Polly was mending a heart of her own. POLLY: Did you enjoy my cooking my sweet? How you gobbled it up. Yum, yum, yum. Was it tasty? You look so cute today. No one looks sexier than you. I was thinking maybe I should take time off from the bakery and maybe we should start thinking about getting married. I really really want a large wedding with all our friends. Maybe, in June. We could go up to the resort in Whistler or the country club in Bothel. What do you think my angel? BRIAN: Where do you keep your cash, bitch? POLLY: I love you honey. WAXIE: Meanwhile across town Marya and Sahara were having a serious discussion of their own. SAHARA: Oh my god, I didn't realize running a brothel was illegal. MARYA: Well, you're lucky this time you got off with just a warning but that's because you know the best lawyer in town. SAHARA: That's why I called you. MARYA: Well it was a good thing you did but next time you might not be so lucky. You may want to reconsider this whole prostitution thing. SAHARA: Reconsider? But sex is not only my lively hood it's my life. I can't just go without it. MARYA That's for you to figure out. I would just hate to see you in the big house. SAHARA: You're right - prison and prostitution is no laughing matter. MARYA: All right call me if you need anything. I'll talk to you later. SAHARA: Thanks Marya. SAHARA: Ladies we need to make some changes around here. Today's close call with the law was a little too close to home. I've decided to suspend operations immediately. No more sex for sale. From this point forward the Happy Endings Brothel will be closed for business. I have put too much emphasis on sex in my life. Today I realized that sex is not the answer. Our society is obsessed with sex - vaginal sex, oral sex, anal sex, same sex, missionary, 69, doggy style, fisting, stumping, scat, flurries, plushies, the Sarah Palin, the Dirty Sanchez, Pao Ga Ma!, Belgian chocolate, Two Girls in a Tea Cup, Crème de Minth, watersports, pegging, indoor sex, outdoor sex, salad sex, you name it's all out there. I guess, my friend Polly was right. Maybe, we should all just give up sex and commit to personal growth. From this point forward I will not only be closed for business but I'm going to swear off sex completely. Ladies clean out your lockers! * * WAXIE (VO): Meanwhile across town that afternoon I had three blind dates. And I was feeling hopeful. SALESMAN DATE: All right, I don't have a whole heck a lot of time for this so let's get right down to brass tacks, shall we. What do you do for a living? You mind if I go first? I'm a doctor. I know, right. Congratulations. Call your mom. She's gonna be thrilled. Doctor Dave, that's what they call me. ERNIE VON SCHAMLTZ: Here you go. So what do you think? Wanna look inside? Wanna see? I would love to show you. PERV DATE: Well, so far I like what I see. You know what else I'd like to see? Your privates. PERV DATE: Your Vera Wang. Frotterate your gooey duck. Your bulging b-worm. Your Ladybird Johnson. Your nuts and bolts. WAXIE (VO): Three horrifying dates and three cups of coffee later, I felt hopeless and decided to cheer myself up by taking a walk in Volunteer Park. * LYNN SHELTON: Looks like the moon is waning... * MARYA: Oh Waxie. That's the price of fame. WAXIE: I know but I just started to cheer up and she made me feel muahhhh blah blah blah MARYA: You know what you need? WAXIE: A hot fuck in a cold winter cabin? MARYA: No! A night on the town with the girls! I'll call Sahara. SAHARA: Hello? MARYA: How about a night out tonight? Waxie needs some cheering up. SAHARA: Perfect, why don't we meet at Pony at nine. I'll call Polly. POLLY: Hello? SAHARA: Waxie needs cheering up. We're meeting at Pony at nine. POLLY: Great, see you then! WAXIE: Toodles! * * * Come take wine and roses * Come take heaven and hell * Come distill this pain you're imposing * * Come on to me I'm someone else * * Be here in my hour of need * It stretched out to a week but who's counting * * Mama told there could be * One man without this doubt and * * You got me speaking in Chinese * * Xie Xie and yes please * How did you reinvent kisses? * * I got this spot and you missed it * * You don't look like much * That jacket ain't working * But you're feeling like someone * * I could get close to in person * WAXIE (VO): After a fun evening of drinking, dancing, flirting and walking and laughing, we went to see my very favorite performer of all time... myself. * * WAXIE (VO): That night made me realize; Love is one thing but friendship is everything. And at the end of the day we're all just little girls longing for love. WAXIE (VO): The next morning, feeling invigorated by my night out with the girls, I thought maybe Polly was right - maybe love can be found online. And I decided to create my own Buttface profile. * * RECEPTIONIST: Caine Blackwell Design Associates - We're committed to your glamorous home, the environment and world peace. How may I direct your call? WAXIE: Caine Blackwell, please. RECEPTIONIST: Who may I say is calling? WAXIE: Waxie Moon. RECEPTIONIST: One moment Mis-ster Moon. CAINE: ...And once that permit comes through, we can get started on the second Space Needle. Yes, ah, yes, yes. Waxie Moon. I hoped I'd hear from you. WAXIE: Well hope springs eternal Mr. Blackwell! CAINE: He who has hope has everything, Miss Moon. WAXIE: Hope for the best. CAINE: Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. WAXIE: Hope, sky and light. Sailor's Delight. A stitch in time saves hope... CAINE: I'm grateful you called. How about a walk, maybe, to the Space Needle? WAXIE: The Space Needle? That sounds like something from the future. What is it? CAINE: It's a Seattle landmark. WAXIE: I've never heard of it. Let's go! * * dear miss you're my * You're my favorite one * I can keep spying one * No one here will ever know * * What I saw * Don't ever want to give this feeling up * * Not once or ever * 6; 5 is coming up and I... * * Little things I find * You leave behind * I've been watching you * While you primp and prune * * And I like everything that I see * * We'll stand together as the ocean burns * * The airplanes flailing, making love to sinking ships, O * * The storms will pull our limbs off * * We'll replace them all with sticks * * And intertwined, my love, we'll make a tree * * One day that tree will learn to be a forest * * That bears the fruit that makes the world remember taste, * And on a hill your voice will echo * * Circling 'round and 'round * Chased by a voice that sounds a lot like mine * * Our voices swirling 'round will make a vortex * * With atoms smashing passionately divine, O * * And spitting bits of matter 'round * * The building blocks of life * And from those goops of ooze new life will spring * * I will watch the species rise, in spite of their decline * As they grow to outer space one day * * You can be the mother earth and raise your many kids * * Even as they claw and bite your skin off * * Then we'll have apocalypse for breakfast * * The landscape boiling deep-fried to a crusty black, O * And after all is silent * We'll give each other smiles * * And close our cosmic eyes and go to sleep * * But don't cry, love * Because we still have time * There's still a sky outside tonight * * And I have eyes for you * * MARYA: Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! POLLY: So did you take my advice and make a Buttface profile? WAXIE: Not only did I post one but I have some exciting news! I am getting married! MARYA: That's soooo romantic! SAHARA: When are we going to get to meet him? WAXIE: Soon enough. He can't wait to meet you. POLLY: Well until then, let's celebrate and go shopping! * * WAXIE: I just, I can't believe this is finally happening to me. POLLY: Oh Waxie, we're so happy for you. It just gives me some hope for my own future. MARYA: Polly, you know you're next. POLLY: All right guys, I can't lie to you anymore. Brian isn't eligible for parole this time. SAHARA: Why didn't you tell us? WAXIE: Oh honey, I'm so sorry. MARYA: He could break out. Have you seen Prison Break? POLLY: It's OK. It'll be fine. Oh Waxie, this day is supposed to be all about you. You shouldn't be crying. You should be laughing. MARYA: She's right. WAXIE: I feel like I'm going to have a whole new life. In few minutes I'll be a new Waxie. SAHARA: Well, I hope this new Waxie can still find time for her old best friends. WAXIE: Oh come here, you. * * A missile cabled through the night * * Wonder if it made its destination * * The big prize all for you and me * * Raise your arms catch and release * * Seek the window tatters in the air * * Fall forward deep into the sea * * The window capers off in pairs * * Fast forward sleeping next to me * * A mess I've grown used to living in * * Wonder if I'll make my destination * * Don't fight more for you and me * * Raised above the caste that faces east * * Seek the window tatters in the air * * Fall forward deep into the sea * * The window capers off in pairs * * Fast forward sleeping next to me * * DAUGHTER: Mommy! Mommy! WAXIE: Over here my darling. DAUGHTER: Caaaiine Blackwell? Who's Caine Blackwell, mommy? WAXIE: Why, that's your father. DAUGHTER: Is Daddy in the ground? WAXIE: Yes my darling, your daddy's in the ground with the angels. LOU HENRY: Mommy, mommy, look! WAXIE: That's wonderful Lou Henry. Now come along darling. It's time to go home. * * Why, hello Margaret. How lovely to see you. Won't you come in? MARGARET: Oh, I can't stay. I just dropped by and bring you these eggs and let you know that Harold and I will not be able to attend your anniversary party. Harold's mother has taken ill How are you Waxie? WAXIE: Oh you know me. I'm just fine. MARGARET: Frankly, I was a bit surprised to receive your invitation. What with the circumstances being what they are, I thought maybe you would forgo having a gathering this year. WAXIE: Perhaps that would be wise, it's certainly not practical... but Caine always loved this party so. It was important for him to commemorate the day we met. MARGARET: Well, suit yourself. I know Harold and I will be sad to miss the party. All right then, I'll see you later. WAXIE: Margaret, may I tell you a secret? My modeling agent called and it looks Iike I'll be filming a commercial. I'm actually headed there right now. So perhaps it's OK to splurge a little after all. MARGARET: Well, Waxie, I'm so happy for you. You'll have to tell me all about it when I see you next. * WAXIE: I just couldn't get this horrible waxy film out of my head! Line? DIRECTOR: Cut! Cut! Cut! Can't you remember your lines? You only got three of them. What is with you? We do not have all day. If you insist on wasting my time.... I told them she wasn't right for this part. WAXIE: I'm sorry. I haven't done this in years. I put my career on hold to be a homemaker. And today is my anniversary.... DIRECTOR: Action! WAXIE: I just couldn't get this horrible waxy film out of my cat. But then, I discovered Pussy's Choice. Pussy's Choice works so well, you'll be tempted to use it on your own hair. I am. DIRECTOR: Great! Now you can go home to your husband and homemake away. DIRECTOR: At least, her pussy did well. CAMERA MAN: I thought she was a widow. DIRECTOR: Oh poor miserable soul. * WAXIE: Oh Caine, you were so able. Happy anniversary. I miss you so much. GUEST 1: For a widow she certainly looks happy. GUEST 2: Do you think that color is appropriate? GUEST 3: I heard she doesn't have a dime to her name. GUEST 4: For a woman her age she's positively radiant. GUEST 5: I feel sorry for the children.... not having a father. GUEST 6: Ladies, hold on to your husbands. GUEST 7: It's nice to see someone could afford such extravagance. GUEST 8: She spared no expense. GUEST 9: Did you see the flowers? GUEST 10: Oh, deviled eggs. My favorite. WAXIE: Ladies and Gentlemen, your attention please. My lovely daughter has prepared a special act for our gay bash and she would like to share with you now. WAXIE: All right, my darling. DAUGHTER: Now, mommy, now? WAXIE: Yes. * * Charles? CHARLES: The door was open. WAXIE: May I help you? If you're looking for a washroom, it is right down the hall. CHARLES: May I have this dance? WAXIE: Why Charles of course. Are you and Lily having a good time? CHARLES: I'm having a good time now, dancing with the most beautiful person in the room. You look positively resplendent tonight. WAXIE: Resplendent? Oh Charles I don't even know what that means. CHARLES: Well, it means available. WAXIE: Charles! Please! CHARLES: Well, you are a widow after all. WAXIE: And you're a married man. CHARLES: With desires. WAXIE: Let's just forget you ever said this. CHARLES: I can't hold back. You know you want me. WAXIE: Charles, stop it! CLIFF: Is everything okay out here? WAXIE: Charles, I said stop it! CLIFF: Leave the lady alone! CHARLES: I don't take orders from domestics. CLIFF: Well, perhaps maybe you should. CLIFF: Beg your pardon, Miss Moon, I have to take out the trash. WAXIE: Leaving so soon? I hope you had a good time, Cliff. Thank you again. CLIFF: Thank you, maam. WAXIE: Please, won't you stay a bit longer? Have a cocktail with me. CLIFF: I would, it's a very nice party. But I think I'm making some of your guests uncomfortable. WAXIE: Nonsense! You are always welcome here CLIFF: Well, I appreciate the invitation. And I wonder if you'll consider an invitation from me. My friends and I are having a little gathering tonight in the village. Nothing big, nothing fancy. Just some music and poetry. WAXIE: Poetry? You can read? CLIFF: Yes, maam. Would you care to join me? WAXIE: I'd be honored. CLIFF: Great I'll pick you up in an hour. WAXIE: That sounds lovely. * CLIFF: Miss Moon, these are my friends - Davey, Florence, Pearl and Jerry. They're real cool cats. WAXIE: It's lovely to meet you. CLIFF: Davey's a preacher. WAXIE: Preacher? JERRY: Don't worry mama. It's a Special kind of church. DAVEY: You should come sometime. WAXIE: Oh, I don't know. I'm Episcopalian. CLIFF: Don't mind them. FLORENCE: Where did you find this dame? CLIFF: Wouldn't you like to know? FLORENCE: Have you shown her your paintings yet? WAXIE: Paintings? Oh, you're an artist? What kind of landscapes? FLORENCE: Honey, landscapes? His work is like jazz - smooth, streaked with rhythm and intellectual. WAXIE: Intellectual? Oh look, it's my maid!

WAXIE: What was that music? CLIFF: It's called rock n roll. WAXIE: Rock'n'roll? It's so.... Different. I've never heard anything like it. Oh, Betsy, you were wonderful! I had no idea you could do such things. BETSY: Who are you to judge me? WAXIE: I don't understand. Betsy I didn't mean to... CLIFF: Are you all right? WAXIE: Yes, I'm all right. But I think I offended Betsy. I feel just terrible about it. Oh Cliff, you know I don't understand these things. CLIFF: Should I take you home? WAXIE: Perhaps that would be best. * * BETSY: The milk boy is here. WAXIE: Thank you Betsy. Good day, Davey. Always nice to see you. Won't you come in? I just made your favorite, chocolate chip cookies. MILK BOY: No, maam. Not today. WAXIE: Don't be silly Billy. They're hot from the oven. I'm sure you have time for one cookie. MILK BOY: I really shouldn't maam. I've been advised against it. WAXIE: Advised against it? What nonsense? That's terrible advice - everyone enjoys a cookie. MILK BOY: No maam, I've been advised not to socialize with you. WAXIE: Not to.... I don't understand. We've always been friends, Kenny. What on earth are you talking about? MILK BOY: My mom says what goes on here is inappropriate. WAXIE: Inappropriate how? MILK BOY: I don't know maam but my mom says you're a woman living in sin with loose morals and a penchant for servants half your age. WAXIE: Oh, Timmy that's just not true. You mustn't believe such things. Where on earth would she get that idea? MILK BOY: From your neighbor, Miss Margaret. WAXIE: Margaret? MILK BOY: Yes maam. WAXIE: Oh Timmy, you mustn't believe everything you hear. MILK BOY: Here is your milk! * * WAXIE: What have I done! BETSY: Let me clean up your mess. LOU HENRY: Mommy! Mommy! Look! WAXIE: Oh my darling Lou Henry what happened? DAUGHTER: He got beat up by boys at school who said you were a bad person. Are you a bad person Mommy? WAXIE: No my darling, I'm your mother. LOU HENRY: Mommy, mommy, look! WAXIE: Oh don't cry my darling. Everything will be all right. I promise. BETSY: Miss Moon, there is a man on the phone for you. His name is Cliff. WAXIE: Not now Betsy. Tell him I'm not in. Mommy did a very bad thing. But I know how to make it all better. * * CLIFF: Hello Waxie. * WAXIE: Cliff you're a nice man but you're slightly younger than me. And yes we have something special between us but that was one night. A night of magic, but I come from a world that's so old-fashioned and unforgiving. And you, your world.... Your world is so... So free... unlike mine. Maybe if things were different we could find happiness. But I can't change my life for you. I have children to think about - Lou Henry and my daughter, they need me right now. They need me more than I need you or you need me. Oh life is so cruel.... Being a widow I never thought I'd find love again. But here you are - knocking at my door, welcoming me into a world of poetry and loud rock'n'roll music. And yes it's irresistible but I'm a grown woman and yes I have needs but there are also responsibilities. Perhaps I've said too much. Have you ever experienced a passion like this before? One that unites souls? Of course you have, but me I'm a woman who knows nothing of these things, a family woman. My life consists of luncheons, bridge games and country clubs and I'm feeling faint... I... But you're right. Maybe it's selfish to give up on this love that's so rare. Like a bird, a fine bird. In a cage, swimming, in a lake, a singing bird like chirping song about a dream of a woman me, but what do I know about music? The music we made that night was different. So different like modern art, expressive rhythms with red paint and streaks of blue and orange like a sunset. Oh how we don't want the sun to set on the twilight of our lives. Living together is impossible. Living, struggle, we must work work, I must work. Otherwise, how can I support you, your art, my children. But you're right, look at me, I came here to end this and here I am in your arms and all I can think is Yes Yes Yes. I must be with you Cliff, I can't imagine a life without you. Why should we be slaves to our passion? Oh how I long to be responsible, reasonable and strong, but the booming voice in my head screams, Yes, yes,yes, I love you, I Love you Cliff, I love you my Darling. I choose you you you, my one and only. My one. Thank you. Oh, Cliff, I'm so happy. * LOU HENRY: Mommy, mommy! Look! DAUGHTER: Mommy, are you ready for your surprise? WAXIE: Of course, my darling. DAUGHTER: You have to close your eyes first. WAXIE: All right my darling. * * CLIFF: It's finished! Do you want to see? WAXIE AND CHILDREN: Yes! WAXIE: It's so wonderful. You're soooo talented. But it looks like there is an empty space here? CLIFF: There doesn't have to be. WAXIE: You're right. There doesn't have to be. * * DAUGHTER: Mommy, what are you doing? WAXIE: I'm going to make a sandwich for Cliff. I want you to watch and learn. DAUGHTER: We're going to make a sandwich? WAXIE: Yes, my darling. There's a time in every woman's life when she needs to take care of her man. This is one of those times. WAXIE: Betsy! Make a sandwich! * * What are you? I don't understand... CLIFF: I, I'm sorry... WAXIE: No! Don't say it! I don't want to hear it! Can't we work this out? We can get you professional help. I'll pay. CLIFF: But I'm happy being a homosexual. WAXIE: No, don't say that word, that word. It's wrong. It's wrong - you disgust me! Don't you understand? We're meant to be together. We fit. Men should be men. Women should be women. * * DAUGHTER: Do you still love me Mommy? WAXIE: Of course, my darling I've always loved you. And I'll never stop. DAUGHTER: Why doesn't Mister Cliff come around anymore? WAXIE: Oh dear daughter, mommy wants to be alone. Go outside and play with your brother. * MARGARET: Your maid let me in. WAXIE: Have you run out of rumors about me that you can spread around the neighborhood? Is that why you're here? MARGARET: Oh Waxie, forgive me! It was never my intention to hurt you. WAXIE: What you did... what all of you did made me feel so alone, so judged. I will never feel like a part of this neighborhood again. I will never feel welcome. MARGARET: Waxie, that's not true. That could never be true. We love you. You'll always be one of us. Why everyone in the neighborhood thinks of you as if you're their own family. It's just that sometimes family has to teach you a lesson, a hard lesson but in a loving way. WAXIE: Well, I learned my lesson. You will never see me with him again. MARGARET: Waxie, that is wonderful news. It's for the best, you'll see. Why now our children can play together again. I will let you use my pool like before. Dry your tears. Now, I know how to turn that horrid grin into a beautiful smile. I'll go home and get some eggs. I will return shortly. Don't go anywhere. LOU HENRY: Mommy, mommy look! BETSY: Miss Moon, your daughter has stepped into a bear trap and fallen down the well. WAXIE: Noooooo!!!! WAXIE: Noooooo!!!! * * DOCTOR: Are you the poor child's mother? WAXIE: Yes, doctor. How is she? DOCTOR: I can see where she gets her great looks. WAXIE: Oh, thank you! Do you mean to tell me that she will live? DOCTOR: Live? She will do a lot more than live. She will run and dance and prance and do all the silly childish things which are so commonplace at her age WAXIE: Oh Doctor, I'm such a bad mother. DOCTOR: A lucky mother, I would say. Bear traps are dangerous. In the thirty years I've been a doctor, I've never seen a child fall into a well and not come out a cripple. WAXIE: It is all my fault. I don't deserve.... DOCTOR: Nonsense. No mother can protect her children from every bear trap that life throws at us. All we can do is endure and hope that God loves us. WAXIE: Oh doctor you're such a philosopher. You understand so much about life. I wish I could understand more. Ever since my husband died I felt like a diamond earring that someone just tossed into the gutter. I keep on shining as bright as I can, hoping that someone will see me, reach their hand through the bars of the gutter grate, pick me up, wash me and treasure me. But all I can see is waste matter, waste matter everywhere. And then I shudder and think - how long can I shine? How long until I'm so covered in waste matter that no one will ever find me? DOCTOR: What was your husband's name? WAXIE: Caine Blackwell. DOCTOR: It can't be. WAXIE: You don't understand doctor. That was his name - Caine Blackwell. DOCTOR: It can't be. All these years. WAXIE: What is happening? DOCTOR: Can't be...I looked so hard. How could I miss it? NURSE: The good doctor served with your husband in the war. The cruel war made them the closest of friends. More than friends. WAXIE: Oh no, not him too, not homosex.... NURSE: They were brothers. Thicker, thicker than blood. WAXIE: Not homo? NURSE: Of course not. They were soldiers. Your husband told him all about you and the children. WAXIE: How nice. NURSE: As they lay there in the trenches, drenched in blood and their own urine, covered in mud and other things, so close to losing their grip on sanity, so close to losing their faith and hope, your husband would tell stories about his life with you and the children. And those stories kept them alive, those stories kept them wanting to survive. WAXIE: Oh Caine.... NURSE: One day your husband was so enraptured with his memories of you, so focused on the stories he was telling that he didn't notice a grenade fall into the trench next to him. DOCTOR: The next thing I knew, I was cradling his head in my arms. Just his head. The doctor in me knew that no man could survive such a blow. But then for the briefest moment, he opened his eyes. And he opened his mouth. And he whispered to me, ever so quietly - "Find Waxie and take care of her forever for me." "Find Waxie and take care of her forever for me." And I looked him in the eyes and I made him a promise. DOCTOR: I am here now. You don't have to cry. * DAUGHTER: Mommy, I'm hurt. WAXIE: Yes my darling, there is a time in everybody's life when we get hurt. And sometimes hurts hurt. But you're going to be better soon. Very soon. I promise. Mommy loves you so much. You are the light of my life. You're my little jewel. And sometimes jewels fall. Fall into a bear trap. And when they fall they get tarnished like fine silver in a museum. But you take out the cloth and tarnish remover and you shine and shine it till it's bright again, and even better than it was before. A bright brilliant shiny, shiny jewel. Remember my daughter, every person is a jewel. And you are no exception. You're such a precious stone. Like an emerald. Or sapphire. Or an opal DAUGHTER: I'm a diamond. LOU HENRY: Mommy, mommy, look. WAXIE: Or a peridot. Whatever kind of precious stone you are, you'll find a way to shine again better than new, like gold. DAUGHTER: Mommy, the doctor said he's going to be our new daddy. Is that true? WAXIE: We'll see, my darling. I've been thinking - maybe I don't need a man to make me happy. Maybe, a woman can take care of herself. Oh I shouldn't say such radical things to my daughter. My darling, I need some fresh air. I will take a walk outside but I will be right back. Don't let your brother break anything. * * WOMAN: The dark lord has arrived, bow down! * DEVIL: [RUSSIAN] Vaksi, karaleva maya. Ya tak dolgo tebya iskal. WAXIE: You must be mistaken. I'm a good Christian woman. DEVIL: [RUSSIAN] Yesli ty menya ne polyubish ya tebya ubyu. DEVIL: [RUSSIAN] Yesli ty menya ne polyubish ya tebya ubyu. WAXIE: I don't understand. I don't speak Russian. * * COP: Seattle Police Department. Put your weapons down. * * COP: Look at this place. What a fucking mess. COP 2: Hey - check out that one. COP 1: I've seen her face before. COP 2: What a shame!
