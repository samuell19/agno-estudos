Listen up! I have a question: do you know what is the largest known living organism on Earth? A zebra? A whale. Or an elephant. Whales are the largest, but they're not fish, they're mammals. Yes, but it's the largest living animal. And what do you think is the largest living organism? The largest examined living organism on Earth is Pando. Have you heard of Pando? You haven't? But not a panda bear, it's Pando with a capital P. This is Pando. - A forest? - Yes. It's a colony of aspen trees in the USA. It's a singular living organism. It encompasses a gigantic area, there are over 40000 stems, it weights almost 600 million kilograms, and perhaps is almost a million years old. Can you imagine? Try to imagine. All those stems come from one gigantic root, like five fingers stem from my hand, or thousands of hairs from my head, and I am still a single living organism. It's the same, just one living organism. And it means that if someone walks through that forest... they believe they are surrounded by thousands of trees. In reality, though, he's surrounded by one and the same tree. Excuse me for a moment, I'll be right back. Over a year, exactly! You're a fucking fraud. PORT HEALTHCARE CENTRE What happened? I saw you arguing with the detective yesterday. Yes, a bit. Why? Why didn't you tell me anything? What for? But he's collecting evidence, he's making progress... He isn't anymore. He's out of ideas. He's already eaten half of our mortgage on expenses. Please, tell me everything. Sure. Maybe we'll go to a real estate agency? We could sell what's left of the house, move somewhere, change the address. One of my patients happens to work in a real estate agency. Pull over, please, I need to get out. Piotr! The phone! Hello? Good morning, Piotr, it's Janina here... Good morning... I'm calling off the record... I have a question. Would you like to come to the crime scene inspection? Maybe this time we'll wait till we know more... Of course, I'm doing this for you. Janina, and you're not sure it's about our daughter? - No, but... - You're not. We will be there. He's already in prison for murder. There, he confessed to another. For now, he didn't give any details, so... we have no hard evidence. Yeah? Is it here? It's freezing. It's freezing. As I promised... Thank you so much. So, Chief, what are we doing? Go after him. Let's go. Hello? Good evening, I'm sorry for calling at this hour. I found your number in the ad. Your daughter hasn't been found yet, has she? No, unfortunately... She came to me in a dream. She said she's far away and that she's all right. She's alive, she just can't come back. She didn't say why. She only asked me to tell her family. She was smiling at me the whole time. But did she give you any details? A phone number or where she is? But she came in a dream... Of course. Thank you very much. Goodnight. - Yes? - Hello? Hanna Wróblewska, I'd like to see Adam. He's not home. You shouldn't have accused him of killing her. But I didn't accuse him, I was saying he loved her and he couldn't have done anything to her. Can you tell him I'd like to contact him? But you know where he currently is? I don't know. Can you at least tell him that I'm still looking? And I could use his help. Put it away, ok? - I'm talking to you. - We're done. Give it to me, please. Maybe that's your daughter? Look. My daughter disappeared. I'd rather no one joked about that. Do you understand? I'm sorry. I am sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Karolina? No, sorry, you're her mother. I know you from a photo. And how is she? I just came back from volunteering in Peru. Karolina claimed I wouldn't last there for so long, but I managed. I just need to get examined for any crap I could've caught. But you know, you never know what's hiding inside. Magda! I'm sorry, I have to go. Where do you live now? In a student house on Litewska Street. Say hello to Karolina and tell her it'd be nice to meet up. From Magda. Goodbye. Please, come in. I wanted to tell you that Karolina... Yes... I already know. I am really sorry. Do you have any idea where she could be? No, unfortunately. Did you know each other well? Just from that club. We chatted sometimes, said our hellos and that's it. She also had a fish tank. Thank you. Piotr? You're back? Good. I'm back. That's good. You already said so. Have you thought about that move? I haven't. You'll feed her when she comes back. Maybe we should stop pretending about the reality? And how is it? You know, you're our fifth clairvoyant. Your colleagues pointed to odd places, we were running around through various bushes and railways, and it was rather cruel, you know? Yes, but Mr. Marcin works with the police. Unofficially. Besides, usually the families come to me themselves. Have you ever helped anyone? How did you do it? So, it's somewhere here. Yes, she went to college in the morning, but never got there. Several people saw her here that day. We don't know why exactly here. And then we know nothing more. So, this is the place of her last mental trace. Sure, a mental trace. I can't explain it to you. If a piece of information appears in the world, it stays there. It cannot stop existing. Even in the middle of a black hole. We've been here several times. There's been dogs, the news, the TV... No one's found anything of interest. Just a minute, please. What if it was your husband? If he knows where the body is? I 'd like to guide you in this direction. Such things happen within families. And that's all you can think of at the moment? This is absolute nonsense. What's up? Mister says you killed Karolina, so you know where the body is, right? Piotr, but you can't be upset about this. Please! We know it's absurd! Wait, Piotr! Stop, please! Hold up, Piotr! I'm sorry, Hania, but I can't do it anymore. What? I can't anymore. I'm exhausted. It's not because I don't love you... Good day? Excuse me? Good evening? Excuse me, ma'am... Mother can't hear. When did you live here? When my daughter was little. I don't know you, then. Or I can't remember. I don't think we bought the flat from you? You didn't. This is a photo of my daughter. Taken here, in the yard behind the flats. When she was little. And I found the photo now, outside, in the trash. It was hung on the wall of the bin shed. Was it you, maybe? But what is this about? Has something bad happened to her? I don't know. She's pretty here. My husband was just cleaning the basement and he threw away some things. Maybe there was something of yours left. But he wouldn't hang the photo in the trash. What for? That's all I know. Excuse me, have you seen this photo? It was found around here. And this girl? I can pay you. And show me your panties. Your panties, show me. If you do, I'll tell you where she is. She's in the port. She's wearing a violet jacket. - Are you sure? - I am. Thank you very much. Thank you, too. Thank you so much. Piotr, get back to me, answer me. Wait! Wait, don't be scared. Don't. I am just looking for my daughter. I am looking for my daughter. I'll show you her photo, okay? Take a look. I was told she walks around here in a violet jacket. Haven't you seen her? Piotr Wróblewski, I can't talk right now, please, leave a message. Hello? Fine. Hanna... Piotr probably told you that the clairvoyant... that it was a provocation by the police, for the paperwork. It was my idea so that we wouldn't have to close the investigation. Piotr hasn't been home since yesterday. Today he came to us. He asked me again whether, if he admitted to killing his daughter, the investigation would live longer. I told him it would. Because... we'd have a suspect... and would have to find evidence to prove what he says. We talked, he left... After... a long time, one of my colleagues found him on the stairs. He was sitting on the steps in front of the station. They took him in. Turns out he had a letter in which he confessed, although I know it couldn't have been him. But without any other evidence... So, we need to check everything anyway. It has a positive impact on the investigation since it can continue. I see. You took him here from the steps. Where is he now? We couldn't help him. I was with him till the end. Although the ambulance came, but... Did he... Did he take any medication? We found a jar of pills on him. Everything indicates... it was a stroke. He must've been taking antidepressants. He probably took a bigger amount today, it could be the reason. He tried to write something when he was no longer able to speak. If only someone had found him earlier or he'd come for help himself... I am really sorry. I'm telling you. You don't believe me? Adam? Adam! Adam! Wait! Hold up! What are you doing here? Don't touch that! - Don't... - Where's our folder? - Please, wait outside. - Where is our case folder? Where is our case folder? Leave it alone. Where is all that evidence Piotr brought? - Where's our case folder? - Hanna... - Where is... - Calm down! And the phone call? The one in a dream, I don't know, do you have those phone logs? Do you know who it was or... - Or the photo I found... - Which one? The photo I brought, has... Has anyone... - Mrs. Wróblewska... - Has anyone been there? Those are clues. Generally, I'm not allowed to show it. From now on, I'll be coming to you. Give it back! Pass it to me! Pass it to me! You're going, kiddo! You dropped your keys when you ran after the ball. Further on. A bit more. I got them! How did you know? I don't know. - Pass it! - Catch! Pass it to me. Karolina made this set for me. I would come to her sometimes. At night. I know. It was supposed to be our secret. I just... I'm sorry I ran away back then. I was drunk. And got scared. Are you still looking for her? There is no me anymore... Who else would look? - Hi. - What's up? What are we doing? No idea. What's going on over there? Boys, come, over here. Chief! You must be kidding me. What am I supposed to do with such a testimony? That, while brushing your teeth, you saw with an inner eye the scene of the crime? And in another vision, you saw the culprit? It's absurd. I won't be able to show it to anyone. Is it that important? It is. Do you want to become a suspect? Such tales are told by culprits when they want to fool us. But you found her. The thing was that... were running from that side... ...that path, it goes down... - Wait. When was that? - I don't know when. Let's take a walk. That is not Karolina. The man you pointed to, he confessed. And it really is a miracle. But we'll be analyzing everything. I don't understand that. The body... it is not Karolina's. Maybe... Did someone sell you information about this case? No one did. We have the killer, so you're free to go. You're certain it's not her? I am. But you found the body exactly where I showed you. Indeed, exactly there. So maybe somewhere around there? No. There's no one there. Are you sure the vision came to you without any reason? Good morning. I just wanted to thank you for finding my son. They finally told me about you, so I came. And about your daughter... do you know anything? I don't. - Good day. - Good day.
