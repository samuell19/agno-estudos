Yes. There you are. Marcus? Well, it's your game. Only two games you've won in three weeks, Marcus. I've met my superior. You might have met something else. I've been given no details, concerning Christian hostage Your curiosity breaks it bounds. It shatters me. Your valiant Greek led me to Lygia And a swag hive of idiots. Their black honey choked my mouth and I said strange words. But for their stupidity, strange words. I should have been broken in half. - Fascinated? - In a way. Yes? The empress requests your presence in her pavilion. At once. I leave you to your fascination. I have been summoned to mine. None of this bodes well. Wouldn't the emperor be angry, if Poppaea's indulgences merely stimulate him to his own. I sense a fresh preoccupation in Nero. He has avoided me. My lord is troubled. A double guard, and yesterday Tigellinus and a squadron of his butchers left for Rome. I feel a strange and heavy breeze. My dear lord. Even your song is sad with its note of death. It is just words. And I sing it joyfully Because love such as I fee I cannot ever die. As always, your entrance is proud. I come as fast as my hands and knees will carry me. As always, sardonic and unassailable. Unassailable? I've never been so readily, so happily, So expertly vanquished in my life. I believe everything except the word "vanquished". I should like to vanquish you, Marcus, like the spider who eats her mate. When he?s no longer necessary? Something like that. I heard you' re planning to leave for Sicily. I must. Three years away, there is too much to look after. Will you go via Rome? Rome? That's rather an indirect route. I know about your little Christian hostage vanishing. I have eyes and ears in the praetorian guard. And an arm or two to fit your waist? Possibly. Did you find her, Marcus? Naturally. only to find myself a fool And sever her chains. You severed them thoroughly? Thoroughly. Marcus. You know how I consoled myself When you vanished from the feast? I consoled myself, with the thought of your death. I fondled your bodiless head, making you smile and frown. What stopped you? It's foolish to kill those you hate. Once dead, they' re beyond pain. I hated you. I welcome your change of heart. If ever she bewitches you again, I shall know. Since I have no hatred for her, I do not care whether she feels pain. You'd never turn the other cheek to me, would you? I don?t know what you mean. But my mouth is here. Have you called Petronius? - Yes, Caesar. - Summon him again. Tell him... As ever, I'm impatient for you. I have missed you, divinity. Forgive me if I've slighted you. I've been steeped in my genius. I sense a fresh inspiration. Your senses shall leap to it. Attend me. Attend me, all. My lack of consideration for you During the past few days in keeping you from my presence Forces me to impress upon you The tribulations of the true artist. When I play and sing, I have visions of things I never dreamed existed. The world is mine and mine to end. Music opens up new worlds for me. I can see Olympus, and a breeze blows on me from beyond the earth. And in those moments, I, a god, feel as diminutive as dust. This is a day for sincerity. Let me open my soul to you. Do you think I do not know That there are people in Rome Who call me a matricide, a wife killer? Call me a monster, a tyrant. There is something they do not realize. A man's acts may be cruel, while he himself is not cruel. And there are moments, my dear Petronius, when... when music caresses my soul, I feel as gentle as a child in a cradle. Believe me? All men should know you as we do, divinity. Only then would they appreciate you. Some say I am mad. I'm only seeking. The flatness and misery of common life depress me. I must exceed the stature of man in both good and evil. Greater than man. Only then will I be the supreme artist. Do you know why I condemned both my wife and my mother to death? I did it in order to lay at the gates of an unknown world The greatest sacrifice a man can put there. "Now, "I thought, doors will open, beyond which I shall catch a glimpse of the unknown". Let it be wonderful! Or let it be awful, so long as it is uncommon! So now... Behold, dear Petronius! My new Rome. It shall rise in gleaming white beauty, Master gem of the world's crown. It shall have a new name, Neropolis, city of Nero. Hail divinity! Something the world has never seen, but what of the Rome That has stood for 1,000 years? The old Rome, our Rome, Dirty and magnificent, But still our be loved Rome It still stands. Does it? It still stands? We never thought of that, did we? Or does it, Tigellinus? Rome is a sea of flames! You hear that? That is my epic! To demolish and create anew! Now, to your chariots! You shall come with me to the funeral pyre. You shall hear my dirge over burning Rome! Its flames shall carry me higher than the gods! All of Rome is burning? All but the palatine area, naturally. - What of the section across the river? - A creeping inferno. Marcus! Stop Vinicius! You! You halt! Now, indeed, Nero has his place in history. There?s one of Nero's soldiers He burned Rome! The people in this house here, have you seen them? They left. Don't kill me! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Here! Go on! Take care of her! The sewers lead to the river! Into the sewers! - Lygia! - Marcus! Lygia! Oh, Marcus! I prayed to see you! Marcus, Miriam is dead, in the fire. She... A wall fell on my mother. We?ll get you out of this. The praetorians are holding the bridge! Open up! - Who is in command here? - I am. - Open this barricade! - Imperial orders. We' re to keep them from entering the palatine area. Break ranks! Let them through! Hold your line there! I'm in charge, commander! Break ranks, I say! Petronius! Look what I?ve created! Tigellinus, my robe of grief. Terpnos! Lyre. History will judge my song. I'm seized with the fear it won?t be great enough. You will be worthy of the spectacle, As it is worthy of you. You encourage me, but I must compete. With those who sang at the burning of Troy. My song must be greater, as Rome is greater than Troy! Silence, ye spheres, be still, ye hurt ling stars, open wide vaulted skies above me. Now at last, I, I see Olympus and a light from its summit dote illumine me I am one with the gods immortal I am Nero, the artist who creates with fire. That the dreams of my life may come true. To the flames now, I give the past, to the flames and soil take thou this Rome. Oh, receive her now, you flames, consume her as would a furnace. Burn on, o ancient Rome! Burn on! Burn on! The mob from burned areas. They want to survive. Who asked them to survive? Tigellinus! The palace is fully guarded. They will never pass my praetorian The night is chilly. Let us withdraw. Is it possible that human beings can produce such a sound? Yes, when they?ve been driven too far. Death to the incendiary! They'll break through! Summon all the detachments. Death to the incendiary! What are they shouting? They have given you a new title, divinity. Incendiary. I've sent for reinforcements. Speak to the mob. Make them some promises. I don't ask. I confirm. Speak to them. Speak to them in my name. Not until other detachments arrive. They had stone me to death now. In what better cause could you die? This was your architect's dream. Go tell them, Phaon. This is all for them. How can we admit that? How could I expect that mob To share my vision? The mob is a wild animal. With an animal you cannot reason. I'm surrounded by eunuchs! Why do you stand aloof? Counsel me! Let them enter. We shall all die, all except you. You, being a god, are immortal. They'll destroy you, also. I do not share your passion For self-preservation. I love Rome. I am not eager to survive it. Petronius, they think you?re their friend. Speak to them! Make promises! Grain! oil! Wine! They will take them, Nero, Without your permission. Insatiable and thank less mob! What do they want? Justice. No mob ever wants justice. They want vengeance, A victim. Tigellinus, it was you who burnt Rome. At your command, Nero. Tigellinus, do you love me? You know it, lord. Then prove it. Go to the mob. Bare your guilt. I would do so gladly, But I am head of the praetorian guard. If I die, they may turn against you. I cannot subject you to that danger. Are you threatening me? Do you hear him threaten me with the praetorian guard? You're all willing to desert me! I know it! I feel it! Nero, my be loved, you were right. Give the people what they want. Give them blood and vengeance, Not one victim, but a thousand. What victims? They worship one they say is higher than you. They're the enemies of the human race and of you. Who are they? They despise our temples And prophesy that the end of the world shall be caused by fire. Well, let it end for them. -Who are they? -They call themselves Christians. Christians. Yes, I've heard of them. The empress speaks rightly. Christians are the enemies of Rome and of the state. Let the people have vengeance. The people suspect you. Let their suspicion turn in this more beneficial direction. They must pay. Do you hear? The Christians are plotting to destroy me. You often remind us of the judgment of history. What will its verdict be, if you punish the innocent and betray your greatness? "Nero, a god, burned Rome, "because he was as powerful as patter. "He loved poetry so much, He sacrificed Rome for a song. " History need not say the burning of Rome was good, but it must say that it was colossal, uncommon. I cannot listen to any suggestion that my emperor is a coward. You were too cowardly to risk your life for him. Petronius is right. He wants to preserve your enemies. Why do you defend them? Because his nephew Vinicius loves a Christian girl. Maybe Petronius is a Christian. Petronius, are you a Christian? I am not. The Christians teach you to love your neighbour, and as I see what men are, I cannot love my fellow man. He does not love you, gentlemen. A tablet, Phaon. The people shall have their vengeance. I hereby proclaim that the guilt of the burning of our be loved city. Rests with the foul sect, which calls itself Christian. They have spread the lie, that it was Nero who burnt Rome. I will exterminate these criminals in a manner matching the enormity of their crime. *, Their punishment will be a warning... a spectacle of terror To all evil men... everywhere and forever. Who would harm you... or harm Rome... or harm your emperor. Who loves you. Pause before you sign this. Rome has given the world justice and order. Sign that, and roman justice Will receive a blow from which it may never recover. Condemn these Christians, and you'll make martyrs of them and insure their immortality. Condemn them, and in the eyes of history, you'll condemn yourself. When I have finished with these Christians, Petronius, history will not be sure that they ever existed. When I grow up, I'm going to be a sailor. Nothing burns at sea. Nero can burn the whole ocean. Marcus! Did you rest well? I was impatient to see the sun rise, And here you are. You should have slept longer. Your journey from Antium and last night must have... I've been asleep too long in many ways, Lygia. I must return to the city and meet with Nerva and the others. Something must be done about this maniac. There must be an answer, quickly, decisive. You do know the answer. You do understand. There can be no turning the other cheek. If I've not returned by nightfall, I'll send word. Marcus Vinicius? I've heard of you. You must realize how grateful we are, for what you have done, for your concern for Lygia. My only concern is for Lygia. Hold yourself straight, youngster. A man must be a soldier. I don't want to be a soldier. Let's talk about our journey. We'll be meeting Paul in Greece. That's good. You'll like Greece, Lazarus. You'll help me fish for men. We'll fish for fish, too. - Are we leaving soon? - As soon as we eat. We shall be starting within the hour. I'm glad... Because I don?t like it here anymore. Yes, indeed. We shall be fishermen together. Please, my lord. Do not trouble yourself so. It's a moment for thoughts. Yesterday I could have gone to the mob Aad told them that Nero burned Rome. I could have offered them a new emperor in general Galba. and so set my seal upon the times. Do you know why I did not? I know nothing of these things. Because I love Nero, perhaps? He fills me with loathing. No. Because out of force of long habit, I've become content to be an amused cynic, a selfish on lookers, lLeaving others to shape the world. Marcus! I was worried about you. You know Nerva here. My third in command, Justin Scipio. We meet in a ghastly hour. The time has come for Galba to replace Nero. Justin is taking this message to him, asking him to come with his legions. Your signature added to these will make Galba confident of his reception. I sign it with humility, on your way. You?re a marked man. You scorned Poppaea. She has death in her eye for you and your Lygia. I'll chance that. Take Lygia and leave Rome quickly. Nero is about to extinguish his conflagration, in a sea of blood. Whose blood? Didn't you hear his orators? The people are being given the story, along with grain and win that the Christians set fire to Rome. - They won't believe that. - People will believe any lie If it's fantastic enough. We'll meet at your house by midday. We'll keep you informed. Farewell, Marcus. Farewell. Farewell? What do you mean, my lord? Nero sent to inquire after my health. A praetorian officer brought his solicitude. He means to amuse himself, By making a sport of my extermination. But then you must... No, no. I have the means to disappoint him. Send Anaxander to me. I'll give him the names of those few I love. He?ll ask them to dine with us tonight. Where is general Plautius' family? They?re all ready in prison. The praetorians collected the whole scurvy lot! Me, raising my children by the house of dirty Christians! Burn the city, will they? Put them in number four. Is the family of general Plautius here? See if we have them. I have an order for their release. A signed order? By whom? I do not accept questions, praetorian. A seasoned campaigner, trapped by love. We've been expecting you. Soldiers hope to die A quick and noble death, but Nero plans for you something more leisurely and certainly ignoble. Put him with his Christian friends. Marcus! Why did they take you? This is none of your doing. I carry my share of the blame. We knew they were after you, but we had no way to send warning I once accused you. I'm proved wrong. It's no triumph for me to find you here. The lions! It is the lions! No! No! Please, god, no! No, dear, no. We must be strong in him, In each other. If he is all-powerful, Why do we find ourselves here? Stand firm. Our children to be sold into slavery, is that what the redeemer promised us? Only by faith, will we endure the ordeal. I thank god Peter and Paul were spared, but I miss their spirit and their courage. I think it's going to rain. We'd better look for shelter. Peter, don't you think so? What troubles you? You've hardly spoken all morning. Oh, I'm sorry, Nazarius. Are you very tired? My mind is as heavy as my body. There is something wrong... with our people, perhaps. I need our lord's counsel. If only he would speak to me... Look! Those treetops there. They do not bend with the wind. Yes, that is so. That sudden brightness coming... Do you see it, Nazarius? It is the light of the lord. I have seen it. Christ Jesus, you are here. What is wrong, o Lord? What should I do? I am weary. How should I follow thee now? Quo Vadis, Domine? Whither Goest Though, lord? My people in Rome... have need of thee. What did you say, Nazarius? My people in Rome have need of thee. If thou desert my people, I shall go to Rome, to be crucified a second time. Nazarius, blessed child, speak on! Speak! oh Peter, you?ve stumbled. Say the words again. I didn't say anything. You said, "if thou desert my people, "I shall go to Rome to be crucified a second time." But I said nothing. Yes. He has again spoken to me. Come, Nazarius. - Where are you going? - To Rome. I have invited you tonight, my friends, You who have been steadfast, through the years. That you have come proves not only your recklessness, but your devotion. You have the wit to bring yourself into his favour again. No. Tigellinus has won. Nero, our master, is at the moment anticipating how he will make me suffer. I shall deprive him of that pleasure. This is an evening of farewell. Where will you go, my lord? You've called me your lord long enough. My name is Gaius. And you've worn this emblem of slavery for far too long. Henceforth, you are free. This villa, its treasures, its gardens will be yours. Why do you say this? Because this evening, with its warmth and feeling... This evening is my signature, the last flourish. Tell the physician to come in. It is not enough to live well, one must die well. No, my lord! No! Please don't let him! I understand the Christians say death is but a transition to a better life. It will be interesting to discover. - Oh, my lord! - My dear, no tears before our guests. Petronius. If the Christians are right, Ttis will be but a brief parting. We can't. We can't part. Eunice! Did you think I could live without you? No! Bind her wrist! For the first time, Gaius, I disobey you. What have I done that forever I should hear the sweet thunder of your heart? You have given me your love. And now, my friends, I wish to write a letter to our emperor. Scribe. Will you permit me? Let us hear it, Petronius. To Nero, emperor of Rome, master of the world, divine pontiff. I know that my death will be a disappointment to you, since you wished to render me this service yourself. To be born in your reign is a miscalculation, but to die in it is a joy. I can forgive you for murdering your wife and your mother, for burning our beloved Rome, for befouling our fair country, with the stench of your crimes. But one thing I cannot forgive, the boredom of having to listen to your verses, your second-rate songs, your mediocre performances. Adhere to your special gifts, Nero, murder and arson, betrayal and terror. Mutilate your subjects if you must, but with my last breath, I beg you, do not mutilate the arts. Farewell, but compose no more music. Brutalize the people, but do not bore them, as you have bored to death your friend, the late Gaius Petronius. Seneca, I entrust to you the delivery of this letter. I'll deliver it. Farewell, Petronius. With you perishes the best of our roman world. Petronius? Dead? By his own hand? - I don't believe it. - I witnessed it, divinity. I shall never forgive him for this! Never! Without my permission? It's rebellion. It's blasphemy! He left you a message of farewell. Then he did think of me. His last thoughts were of me. How I loved you, Petronius! You were my one friend. You alone understood my soul. Tigellinus, the weeping vase. Who will listen to my songs now? Who will appreciate the true value of my verses? I weep for you, Petronius. One tear for you. One for me. Seal up these fruits of my sorrow, so that posterity may know how Nero grieved for his dearest friend and truest critic. And now for his tender words. Destroy! Destroy his house! Every stone to dust! Burn his books, slaughter his animals! Kill his servants, male, female... Every one! Beat his memory into the ground! Where is the emperor? Let Nero start the games! The lions are hungry! Bring on those house burners! I doubt if we can chance anything today. Have you heard news of the commander? Only that he's been taken. O holy gods of Rome, in the name of Nero, emperor and supreme pontiff, we beseech you to receive in sacrifice the lives of those who sought to destroy this sacred and eternal city. Have strength as he did. It will not be long. Oh, dear lord Jesus, help them! Help them. Don't. Don't torture yourself. I'll be as close to her as I can. You may give the signal, divinity. Peace to the martyrs! - Peter! - Peace! Peace to them! Take thy children, lord. Numb their wounds. Soften their pain. Give them strength, o saviour! - Seize that man! - Blessed are you, my children, Who die in the name of Jesus, this day you shall be with him in paradise. Here where Nero rules today, Christ shall rule forever! - Who is that man? - I think he is their leader, a man called Peter. But he said Christ would replace me, What sort of... By the light of the dawn of a glorious... They' re singing. In his triumph, the son of god arose and the trumpets of angels made greeting, Christ is King, Christ is King. Alleluia! Lift your eyes and your hearts To the glory on high... These dogs have effrontery. The lions will sing louder. Who arose on that paschal day He shall reign He shall reign eternal... Peter! Peter! Could our lord at least not have saved you? Oh, peter, why did you come back? It was the lord's will. Nazarius is safe. Some good people sheltered him outside the city. By the light of the dawn, in his triumph, the son of God arose. Sing to him as he now opens his arms to you. Sing to the welcome of Christ, our Lord. Christ is King. Christ is King. Alleluia! More singing! Why aren't they afraid? They should have been tortured first, their insolence destroyed. What of Vinicius and Lygia? Shall we bring them after these? Yes. Alone, with the hungriest lion. Not yet. I want Vinicius and his flower held in reserve. I am planning something... - A surprise for you. - What is it, Poppaea? It will not be a surprise, then. Please. Have I ever disappointed you in conceiving new delights? New thrills? True. You haven't. Singing. How can they? Beyond understanding. Don't clear the arena at the end of the day. I'm most curious. No face on this one at all. Oh, look! There's another one smiling. It's monstrous of them to die smiling. It's inhuman. Yet they look like ordinary people. Peter put an evil spell on them. Yes, Peter. Something singular must be done with him. Marcus? Yes? "Nothing do I see that is not perfection". That night you said it, Even though you were most predatory about it, even then my heart must have told me, that is the man you will love. Only then you wouldn't let me. Hear my heart talking, Marcus. I said a great deal, I remember, All of it loud and empty. I would so loved to have given you a son. Lygia! Oh, Marcus, no matter what, I want to be your wife. Now. Peter will say the words over us. I want it to be that way before they take us, so it will be that way, when we are together again. You would never wish me to pretend, would you? Pretend? That I feel myself Christian. It's still strange, new. There's something I can't quite... I mean... Yes, It's proven good, full of courage, right here. But there are many things I cannot believe, understand. Christ is within you, Marcus. You feel him more strongly than you know. Come. Peter. Before I die, I want to marry Marcus. This is a holy thing, my son. It concerns Lygia. I look upon it as holy. Marcus, Lygia, may he who blessed the marriage at Cana, bless you also. Love one another from this moment forward, as man and wife in his holy name. In the name of the Father. And of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, in this life and the next, now and forevermore. Marcus... My husband. Here he is, your majesty. Do you approve? Very much so. It will be like a fresco from Crete... The maiden sacrificed to the Minotaur. It will be a spectacle worthy of the emperor. Superb conception. You seem sad, my black friend. Do not grieve. I promise you a playmate. For your lonely horns to fondle and caress. You are the man Peter? I am Simon, called Peter. "Peter has been heard to preach rebellion, against the rule of the emperor. It is decreed that he be taken to Vatican hill, where he made his first preachment, to be crucified and left there as a warning, to all who wish to call themselves Christians". To die as our lord died, is more than I deserve. We can change that. You'll notice, divinity, They've stopped singing. They have, haven't they? - Do I know that man? - General Plautius. He conquered Parthia when you were a boy. Rome made him famous. He repaid her with treason. What a dramatic reversal! I shall write a poem. People of Rome! I am Aulus Plautius, once general of your armies. Rome is ruled by a monster, who tells you the Christians burned Rome, but he lies! You lie, Nero! You are the incendiary! Nero kill s Christians to deceive you. He alone is guilty! I swear it by my death and by my... I begin to envy Petronius. I have envied him long since. This is a blot on Roman justice. The mob isn't as happy as it was. Heaven's son, eternal Lord, who reigns above, we pray to thee, As night goes on. O shield us! They are singing! With thy fatherly love, securely sheltered, From all fear, Thy grace abounding, let us rest. He said something to Nero. I could not hear the words. Nero's looking at a man That knows how to die. Take him! Commander? They?re not parting us. Prepare her. Here is our honoured guest. - Why is he not in the arena? - He will be... in spirit. It's a giant! It's Hercules himself. Let us see him guard the girl from death. But what is the contest? Look! They brought Marcus here to face this! Do not fret, Vinicius. Remember I said I did not hate her. I wish her no pain... Lasting pain, that is. I am devastated, dear Petronius is not here to witness our pleasure, Vinicius. "Sing no more", he said. Upon these lilies I heap now, red roses upon red, a blood-red tide shall surge, upon her milk-white flesh. You do have some taste, but she's too narrow in the hips. They know how to die. In death you will squeal. - Give him the sword! - No! Stay! My lord, would you deprive him of his final pleasure? Superb, Poppaea! Magnificent! A fair contest. Nero's justice is proverbial. If the bull wins, the girl dies. If our Hercules destroys the poor animal, I shall spare her life, for Vinicius to breed more Christians. Christ! Christ, give him strength! Seize him! Burner of Rome! Thumbs up! Burner of Rome! Ready up there? First line, follow me. Citizens of Rome! I am Marcus Vinicius, Commander of your 14th legion. This man burned Rome, killed innocents for his crime. The rule of this madman has ended. Rome is yours again! Tonight general Galba marches from the north, your army has risen. Hail Galba! Galba, new emperor of Rome! A sword from Plautius! Where are the praetorian guard? Dead or in revolt. Dead! All dead! My dear mama, Octavia, the wife I loved, My friend, Petronius... All dead. Dead. You alone are left. "Kill the Christians", you said. It was you. It was you who turned my people, my faithful subjects Against me. You are my evil genius! What are you doing here? I banished you! I told you that when you needed me, I would come. You defied me! Be gone! Acte, what will they do to me? They will kill you. They won't get in! You've lived like a monster, now die like an emperor, by your own hand. I didn't wish to be a monster. The gods willed it! Now, or they will find you here. Is this, then, the end of Nero? Yes, my lord. To be lord of the earth and my own executioner. Quickly! How taste less life will be without... How can they face such a world? How can they endure it? Now, my lord. Help me, Acte. Hail Galba! Hail Galba! Hail! Hail Galba! Hail! Hail Galba! Galba has a task ahead of him, rebuild Rome and bring back justice. The glory that was Rome will never be reached again. Babylon, Egypt, Greece, Rome... What follows? A more permanent world, I hope, or a more permanent faith. One is not possible without the other. What is it, commander? In this very spot, Peter and I turned back to Rome. It was here the lord spoke to him. It's a blessed spot. Quo Vadis Domine! Quo Vadis Domine. Quo Vadis Domine Lord, whither goest Thou, how can we know the way? "I am the way, the truth, and the light". Lift your eyes and your hearts to the glory on high, of the Lord who arose, on that paschal day. He shall reign. He shall reign eternal. Christ is King. Christ is King Alleluia! Alleluia! Vtg
