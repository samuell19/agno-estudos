CHECKOUT GIRL: A LIFE BEHIND THE REGISTER BASED ON THE BOOK BY ANNA SAM A PIERRE RAMBALDI FILM ÉMILE ZOLA THE LADIES' PARADISE 4,523 readers have joined us today. is celebrating its millionth visitor. All this is beyond me. As a child, I wanted to be an air hostess. Or a nurse. Or a dancer. Or a schoolteacher. I had a weakness for schoolteacher. When do we lose our childhood dreams, our irrepressible, turbulent fantasies? When everything seemed possible and allowed. When do we lose that taste of eternity? I didn't need to be an adult so soon. From one day to the next, with no warning. You leave your dreams behind, and suddenly they fly away. That's how it starts. You get up every day at the same time and come home exhausted. Here, it's 8 hours a day. You say it's the same elsewhere. But here, it's... unique. -You're late. -Hey. Yeah, that's it. Unique, because we see all of humanity walk past without seeing us. That strange feeling of being able to disappear, of being transparent, with this lack. No place to move; no respect. So much is lacking... You're late. -By one minute. -One minute is one minute. It's my break. Here we go again. 8 hours of getting in someone's way. 8 hours of noise. 8 hours of beeps. 8 hours of "thank you," 8 of "hello." 60 deactivations of antitheft devices and 8,200 finger movements a day. Deal with the clients. Swallow their comments: the mean ones, the cynical ones, the original ones, and even the most... So it goes. If you don't work hard, you'll end up a cashier. How can anyone say that? How do you respond? You don't. 75.40 euros, please. Credit check, check, or cash? The French presidential campaign is kicking off as an unprecedented workers movement takes hold: cashiers at large retailers are coming out in protest. -How's it going, Charlie? -Good, sir. Thank you. You gain some weight? No. You're at reception. You're important for the paper's image. ... for several months by the blog humorous account of the difficulties encountered by this class of employee. The discontent... -Where are we with this blog? -Sorry. ... or stir up tensions. Good morning, Mr. Ferry. Coffee, please, Eddy. Me too: in a mug, with steamed milk. Just a bit. I want to find this supermarket madonna, Augustin. We can't confirm who the author is, even with an IP. Is it a fixed IP, or does it change? The IP can change. It varies with the internet service provider, I think. When her blog disconnects, her IP changes. That makes it impossible to ID her. I'm truly sorry, Mr. Ferry. Have a seat, Augustin. You're truly sorry? And I'm disappointed. When I'm disappointed, there's consequences. Get your head out of your ass. If we get beat by the competition on this, you'll be fired. For good. I'd feel bad about that, because I like you. In the second post, the author says that the only luxury they have is a swimming pool near work. Of course, sir. There are 4,827 supermarkets in France. Three are within 200 yards of a pool. What does our mole say? She's still undercover. Tell her she's being extracted. We need her results. Fast. You haven't been here long, but, There's no room for discussion about the colors. -Hello. -Hello. We don't take cards at this register. No, I said we don't take cards at this register. No problem. There. Unbelievable. That's 47.50. Actually, I just said we don't take cards. What are you telling me? We're telling you we can't take cards here. So? I'm sorry, ma'am. I can't take cards. Are you blind, young lady? -No, ma'am. -This is a platinum card. Do you see that? That doesn't matter, ma'am. I said we don't take cards! You don't get it. Drat! Drat, yourself! That's crazy. What are you doing? 6.45, please. Those chips are from here. Yeah. I'm sorry, but... ... they're on sale. On sale does't mean free, sir. Sorry. How much do I owe you? Scan, Solweig. Sure, Mr. Mercier. Relax and snack with a bag of chips, only 1.30 euros. Type in 1.30 euros. 7.75, please. -Here. -Thanks. -Bye. -Bye. You're a cashier. That means you scan everything! Hello. Solweig, hey. -You're by yourself? -Yeah. I just can't. I feel like I got hit by a truck. I can't feel my arms. My back's a mess. It's because you're new. They give you the hard stuff. Isn't that nice. You'll get used to it. Like everything else. -Do you have kids? -No. Thank God. Can you imagine? I'm already taking Proxen all day. Proxen? What's Proxen? Nothing. It's from the US. Take one and you feel great all day, even if you're exhausted. -That's crazy. -No, I'm joking. I don't know how you could afford to have a kid on a cashier's salary. I have one. -Really? -Anatole, my little brother. After my dad's accident, it was just us. That can't be easy. -You look after him alone? -Yeah. That's life. I don't have a choice but to make a living. As they say, I left my dreams behind, and then I watched them fly away. When you say "they," are you talking about the cashier blogger? From Miss Cashier Speaks? I like what she writes. It's nice. I don't know. And you? Yeah. Sometimes I think it could be better. Where do you live? Near the station. I'd better go. If I miss my bus, then I miss the train. -Bye, Marie. -Bye. End of the day. I'm exhausted. -What are you doing here? -They changed my hours. On Fridays I do 8AM-12PM, and then 6PM-9PM. No way. Are you serious? I don't have a choice. -Doesn't it make things complicated? -Ah, well. Yes, it complicates things. Not to mention my morning job. Where are my sweeteners? Where are my sweeteners? -Here. -Thank you, Solweig. -Without my sweeteners... -I know. Bye, Solweig. -Goodnight, Sandy. -Goodnight. I start hearing them again: the beeps and register sounds. You think you're losing it, that you've completely lost your bearings. You start doubting everything, about yourself and others. -Are you coming? -Not tonight. Come on. What's wrong? He can't hear anything. Nothing. Stay here, OK? At first, it's of necessity. An urgent need. No choice. So you take it, but you're sure it won't last, that it's temporary. And then... It goes on and on. The temporary moves in for good. They say that cooking makes the cook. Well absorbing all this, registering it, is how one becomes a cashier. It's the only job that becomes an inescapable calling. How can this be anyone's calling? Hey. -Hi. -Hi. What's wrong? -Is something wrong? -No, nothing. Today's honey day. Honey and Christmas? I don't get it. They'll do whatever they can to sell off their back stock. What a shit show. -Aren't we late? -Yeah. -Come on. -Help me. You're not helping, Sandy! You gotta help me. Come on. -I can't get it on. -She'll never fit! She has to suck it in. Oh, Christ. All right. There. It's a little tight, but come on, I look great. I feel just right. You're stunning. You even have wings to help you fly. And antennae, too. It's like Maya the bee. Yeah. No way. This is ridiculous. No, you look cute. Stop pouting. It's funny. I don't know about the scarf. Wow, your necklace! It's so nice. Is it gold? Yeah. With real diamonds. It's so sparkly. Yes, it's... my grandmother's. I can't seem to take it off. A good luck charm. You're sure sentimental. I'm sentimental, too. Really. I can't breathe in this, but I love it. I love it, too. I think I'm super hot as a bee. Miss Cashier Speaks is right: This is a calling. That's not exactly what she said. She said it's the only job that becomes an inescapable calling. You learned it by heart? Leïla, why is it only registers 11-14? Because those bastards put the displays by ours. You're quite a display yourself! I'll display myself right down this aisle! Check me out, check me out. Are you stupid? Do you want to be a manager or not? The truth is, Maurice, that you need to be a bit less dumb. -It's not easy, Mr. Mimoun. -Ah, it's not easy. -It's not easy to be less dumb? -Not that. The thing I don't get is the facing. Facing. Here, look. Here. That's facing. Is that not a beautiful pyramid? Are you with me or not? -Isn't my pyramid beautiful? -Yes. All right. Now come see this aisle. There. You see? See what a mess you made? The lower shelves are for budget products, for the loss leaders. So why did you put the Irish coffee chocolate that costs 4.95 all the way down here? Because you're an idiot. And then way up here, you put the sale product. How stupid can you be? How are the little old ladies, and the kids, and anyone whose arms are too short, going to grab the three jars of honey for 4.90? They're not -- What... My pyramid! MANAGEMENT -I'm counting on you, Mr. Mimoun. -Thank you sir. The truth is girls, you screwed up big this time! Are we fired? He can't stand you. So watch yourself from now on. They're pissed. They're very upset. Thanks for the translation. Mr. Mimoun, "pissed" is English. -Standard English. -Standard? What are you talking about? You want to give me, Simon Baoudj Mimoun, English lessons? Where are you from? Huh? Come on, get to work. He's right. We have to be careful. No, they're too scared of the blog to fire anyone. -You think so? -Yeah. It all ends up on the blog. People are starting to get upset. It's crazy that a little blog like that is mobilizing more people than a big union. Must be some chick writing it! I don't think she anticipated all this. 5.25, please, sir. What? I'm sorry. You can buy two, but not three. You can shove the third one up your ass. Excuse me? What did you just say? I think you heard me. I heard. This man insulted you. I witnessed it. We all did, didn't we? Stay outta this! What's going on here? Sit down right now. SHATY, SHATY, SHATY. This cashier here is starting to piss me off. Do you know how to count? Good God. This money is perfectly valid. Just because it's ripped in half doesn't mean anything. You're the one who's not valid. Do you know how to count? Look, it has three digits. 1, 2, 3 digits. -See? -What's the problem? Your little cashier won't take my hundred bucks. Calm down or I'll call security. Call security if you want, little man. No problem. Vulgarity is a crime, miss. Oscar Wilde. You know Oscar Wilde? I know a few of his plays, and... The Picture of Dorian Gray, of course. 34.60, please. -Here. -Thank you. One more thing. What's shaty, shaty, shaty? SHATY. It means "smile, hello, amiable, thank you." It's the cashier's code. Management is letting this last episode slide. But trust me: Next time will be your last. Imposed by that kind of idiot. Stop worrying about that guy. He's always on my back. He's like a vulture. Leïla's right. Forget about him. I can tell it'll end badly. After Mimoun, it's all falling on us. You were the one falling on us this morning. I didn't fall on you, I said it was stupid. Whatever, Sandy. I'm fed up with your stupid morals. What? There aren't many whales like you, but ones who moralize? I've never seen anything like it! -What'd you say? -What are you doing? Stop it! You're crazy! You cashiers are crazy. Who do you think you are? Aren't you one? That's enough. -We're all exhausted. -So am I! It's been ten years! Before I came here, I got up at 5 AM to go clean at McDonald's! And then this ho calls me fat! What do you want? You want to make us cry? I go clean rich people's houses every night, too! So what? You want to trade? Is that it? I have no life! I gained 37 pounds! I can't get out. How do you get by on 1,100 euros when you have three kids without jobs? You... You called me a whale. Apologize, or I'll knock your teeth out. Well? The ho apologizes if the whale apologizes for calling me a ho. I'm sorry. Usually you shake hands. Or you hug. She's not hugging, she's crushing me. 37 pounds. Christ, I was scared. Good thing you didn't fight. Anyway, thanks. I'd be dead without you. Seriously though, if she hit me she'd bust my head right off. We've been waiting for another English lesson! Ah, I see. Yeah, come on. Ma'am, I kindly request that you moderate your language or I will be left with no choice but to... get upset. You trippin' girl! And you, cut it out or I'll mess you up. You trippin' girl! I'll mess you up! That's trash. Super lame. I don't think so. How do you say "great"? -Dope. -Dope, right. You're dope. This thing sucks. I have to go. This place is nothing, no sun, no future. Her English isn't so great. What did she say? She said, "nothing, no sun, no future." "Nothing, no sun, no future." Sounds about right. -Hello. -Good evening. I'm Solweig Antoniazi. I'm here for Veronique Sillik. Ah, right. She told me. Thanks for filling in. Yeah, she broke her foot. I hope I'll do OK. With a Masters in Education, I'm sure you'll do just fine. Please, come in. Benoit isn't an easy child. But Veronique told me you were used to that. He's very nice with Veronique. Véronique's crazy hard though. Benoit! Benoit, stand up this instant. This is Miss... -Solweig. -Right, exactly. Solweig. She's filling in for Veronique. Damn! Check her out! Forgive him. He's impossible. I'll compensate you, of course. It's OK. Listen up, kiddo. You want to fight? Then I'm outta here. But my English lessons are fucking dope, all right? What do you think bro? I'm writing a thesis on inner-city slang. Should I bounce or what? She's cool! Here. This is for today, and I always pay one lesson in advance. Oh, thank you, but one is enough. Veronique will be back soon. SOLWEIG ANTONIAZI The snow is beautiful. It really is. Goodbye, ma'am. Goodnight. Thank you. Goodnight. You told her I had a masters? And that I taught at a private school? What's that all about? Stop it. I'm a cashier at a supermarket, just a cashier, OK? I don't like lying. Next time forget about it, even if you break two legs! It's over! Sir, your mother is waiting for you! It'd be a shame to make her wait! You're... being expected. And it's snowing. I've got time. Under a tree, even if it's snowing, lightning can strike anyone, at any time. I'll take you home. May I ask whether you'll be coming today or tomorrow? Don't listen to him. He's a joker. Can I take you? No, I... That's OK. Thanks. I know this might seem crude, but... It's not. Here's my number. Ah, shit. Fucking piece of shit car. -Why are you upset? -You're pissing me off! Did you see how pretty she is? I have to be there at 8:30 sharp to pick up a Russian prince and his two whores. Fred? -What? -I think I'll marry her. Are you kidding me? Your shitty car isn't starting. Hey! Mom? I'm sure the first two numbers are 0 and 6. Of course. It's a cell phone. Parmesan? -No. -Why? I didn't have time to buy any. I don't understand. There's parmesan at your work. -It's easy to bring home. -True. But I just can't. Once I get off, I can't bring myself to go back in. So no parmesan. Who cares about parmesan Anatole? Just put the tomato sauce on. It's not the same. I had a hard day at work, -so don't start. -What? Don't be difficult. I don't want your tomato sauce! I can't read it now. Who's number is it? None of your business. I'm really sorry. I didn't know it was... It's OK. It's OK. I'll never forget that you hit me outside school! I'll never forget it! Starting now, you're no one to me. You're not my brother! Benoit, please. When you're a brother, or a mother, or a... father, it's for life. Maybe. But he's not my brother. How was the French teacher? She's great. She's very nice. She has a Masters and she teaches at a private school. She seems very competent. She's doing a thesis on inner-city language. Isn't that interesting? Inner-city language, great. She comes every Monday? What's your problem? Don't you get it? Veronique is away. Solweig replaced her, that's it. Excuse me, sir. Do we know each other? I've never met you. Who are you? Christ. Great. He needs to calm down. What's that mean? Employers are upset over the blog "Miss Cashier Speaks" as more striking workers gather outside most large retailers and supermarkets. There have been numerous walkouts, particularly in the Paris region. There are shades to your indifference. Some say goodbye, but not hello. Others say neither. Some don't say a word, not even thank you. Note, that for us, we rarely omit the hello. Hello. Do you know that we scan 5 tons of items a day on average? That's an elephants worth. And when large retailers bring in half their revenue during the holidays, we cashiers scan twice as many elephants. So to start with, I propose we get a bonus for every elephant we lift. That way, if we put each bonus end to end, we'd be able to make ends meet. What do you think? And you, Miss Large Retailer, looking down from way on high, I'll tell you outright: Stop treating us like machines. Maybe it's a utopia. A cashier's utopia. Losing our lives to win is one thing. But working more to make less, is another. I propose to all of you that you move past your indifference and discover that there might just be intelligence behind each register. Who are we? Who am I? "I'm one of 640,000 cashiers. "I hold the belief that with this blog, "and in the name of cashiers throughout France, "it is possible to help the media, "which, thanks to our colleagues in Rennes, "are finally aware that we exist." Thank you. She's awesome. Did you see the news last night? No. My boyfriend broke the TV trying to fix it. Well all the cashiers are starting to strike. "Hey, hey, big box stores, we're gonna kick your ass." "Hey, hey, big box stores, we're gonna kick your ass." "Hey, hey, big box stores, we're gonna kick your ass." "Hey, hey, big box stores, we're gonna kick your ass." Hey, hey, big box stores, we're gonna... What's wrong? Shit. Excuse me, Mr. Mercier, but you shouldn't be in here. Understand? I could complain to management. -To management? -Yes. How amusing. You're brand new here, and yet so confident. This is the women's dressing room. It's for women. You came in without knocking. Speaking of management, they'd like to see you in five minutes. You personally. -Me? -Don't be late. Why me? What a pig. What's going to happen? What will they do? Don't worry. It will be OK. He's just trying to scare you. No! He didn't say just anything. He said, "You personally," to me, personally. Don't worry. We'll be ready. Yeah. Really? Whatever that clown says, we'll say the opposite. We're here. Don't worry. All right, I'm gonna get to work. -"O Christmas tree, O..." -No way. Don't worry. -I'm going. -Yeah. You seem hesitant. Don't you want to marry her? Yes, of course. -Well then. I'm going. -Yeah, go. And then come back. Yeah. Hey. -You don't look so good. -I'm not. -You OK? -I'm dying of cold. They put me out here. I'm pissed. I'm OK. But Sandy can't be doing well. Three managers have been questioning her for a half hour. About what? No idea. It's almost 10. Are you coming to work? Yes, in half an hour. I lost my pass. You can come with me. OK. I'll stop by maintenance. -I'll see you later. -OK. OK. Well, thank you. -Bye. -Bye. Yes? Yes, we got disconnected. I was saying he's handsome. Some guys are not bad, but that's it. But he's handsome. I fell head over heels. That's just how it is. It's chemical. That's true. Hang on, Josie. One second. Yes? Oh, that's you in the photo. Yes, that's me. -Someone just dropped it off. -Thanks. I couldn't help but overhear, but you're right. It's chemical. Excuse me? It's totally that. It's... It's chemical. He got out of his Rolls Royce and came to my rescue... The snow was falling around us. I felt like I was floating. Right, right. And mine's always riding his stallion. You'll see him in the store with his big red cape. You'd think he was flying with his horse. Shouldn't you be at work? So? So nothing. -Nothing? -I turned in the pass and that's it. What'd she say? Did you get a date? Are you taking her out? You know what? She's a cashier. -What's wrong with that? -It's fine. Why'd she say she's a teacher with a masters? I need to do some thinking. Will that take long? I don't know. A girl who doesn't want you to know what she does must be a girl who doesn't want you to know who she is. Right? There you go. 12.90. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Thank you. And twenty. Thanks. Bye. Goodbye, ma'am. Hello. I'd like two red bulbs and two silver ones. six plastic garlands, an electric one, a little Jesus, two donkeys, and a mini Christmas tree, like the one on your head. Sorry. It's for our Christmas Eve. Yes, I'm nimble fox. "Nimble fox" is my scout name. OK. We're celebrating the birth of Jesus with my scouts. Thank you. Have you seen my cart? I left my cart... That's not my cart. My cart! I can't even... Why did I sign up for this? To survive, maybe? I think I'd rather starve. So? -Say something. -They're looking for her. Who? The blogger girl. They've been checking her posts, and they think she's from here. You find time to write between this and your cleaning gig? Are you nuts? They asked who it could be. First of all, I have no idea. And second, I'm not a rat. I think they're right. The blogger's from here, I'm sure of it. I can feel it. Are you a cashier or a cop? I don't know. Neither. I'm not a cashier for much longer, let me tell you. I can't anymore. It's too much. One section comprises eight horizontal rows and is 20 feet of shelf display. So... -Can I go pee, Mr. Mimoun? -As I was saying: When I increase the display, that means... The product is underrepresented. When I decrease the amount on display, that means? What's the point of knowing this? What? What's the point? Are you trying to get philosophical with me? -Is she wrong? -To go pee? No. To get philosophical about big retail stores. Oh, you think? You see them? They walk faster than them. That's true. How is that possible? How is it possible? Because at Parody, they have this thing. Their floor is on a very slight incline. So when you come in, it's going down. But when you're leaving, it goes up. And so customers take longer. They take longer, and they buy and buy and buy. I'll tell you the truth. Philosophy doesn't exist, Solweig. All that exists is the 200 billion in revenue. Understand? 200 billion changing hands here. You know, I did the math once. We lift 1700 pounds of product an hour. That's 33 tons a week. Tell me, Solweig. Are you Miss Cashier Speaks? Oh, my girl. Your face gives you away. And I understand exactly what you mean. OK? I'll let you be. Solweig. You're wreaking havoc in retail. They'd better not find out. No. Is it me? Yes, it's you. "Ah, have no fear. Young I may be; "but in the noble heart valor's no need of years, a thing apart." Fred, if Rodrigue talks like that, it will be very hard for me. It's OK; it's OK. All right? Let's continue. "Against me, you'd measure your mettle, "You who have never even seen a battle? "Do you know who I am?" Are we working or not? -Sure, let's work. -OK then. Sorry. "Yes; "another at the mere sound of your name might quiver. "The laurels with which your head is wreathed might seem... "The laurels with which your head is wreathed might seem..." Seem what? I don't know. Come on. Where is his head at? Tell me when he's got it. Look, stay... Come on. We're OK. We have to... -Please stay? -Sorry, Fred. Ah, OK. Great. Thanks. Thanks a lot. -Have a nice day. -Yeah, great, thanks. If tutoring is a side job then why not say she's a cashier? What are you doing to me? What's important? Her or the play? Well? I think she's bluffing. I think she's lying. She's ashamed. You know what? Next time, go to your brother's session. Then you can ask her whether she's really a cashier. Then you sleep with her. Then you'll come back, calm and relaxed, -ready to work. -What? I'm talking about love here. Le Cid. Corneille. Look. "The laurels with which your head is wreathed "might seem to give warning of my defeat." How much do I owe you, René? 47.50. -Here. Keep the change. -Thanks. What's wrong? This is the third time. I got here too late. -See ya. -Bye. Goodnight. Well? I don't understand. There's 5 missing. Did you take out the 12 from this morning? Yes, I said. I'm really in a hurry. -I have to go the hospital. -You have all weekend. That's what Sunday's for. Is there a problem? -And the discount vouchers? -I checked. Apparently not. There's 5 missing. Start over. Let her go. She has to go see her father. This is not your business. Dear customers, after honey week, this is douchebag week. Easy to spot him: He's got a shit-colored brown suit. The douchebag is in the store. He's ugly. His name is Mercier and he's an asshole. -Let me go! -Let her go! You're hurting me! She didn't do anything. Take your stuff and get out. Get the hell out, Kassagi! -What got into you? -Forget about it. I'll go see management tomorrow. I'll explain that it was all my fault. No, you're not. What are you gonna say? How was it your fault? That bastard tortures you and it's your fault? Just drop it. They're going to prosecute. Prosecute what? Fuck him. What does he want? I'm paying off 4 loans. I owe money to the whole planet! I'm in the deepest shit you could possibly imagine. Mercier can't get blood from a stone. I'm pregnant. Do you have a tissue? My little girl Soura's gonna have a baby brother. Life is beautiful. When God closes a door... He opens a window. Yeah. You know that one? Can you do me a favor? Come on. Tell me about the guy with the Rolls Royce. I already told you. I don't know. It was... It was like a dream. Tell me again. I love the way you tell stories. Sorry, here I go again. Give me a Kleenex. Thanks. Solweig? -What is it, Anatole? -I can't stop thinking. I can't fall asleep. It's all mixed up. My math teacher, Dad. -How's it going with your teacher? -She's as dumb as a doornail. I think I piss her off. -Then stop. -I can't. Just seeing her makes me want to annoy her. Why is Dad's coma lasting so long? It just depends. He could wake up... in a day, or in an hour. You don't know anything. You don't. Don't worry, Anatole. It's gonna be OK. I see you're ready to sleep in my bed. OK. Kiss. Coma's are weird. Because I know I won't sleep, I sleep better. Me too. Today, I'll say "hello" about 250 times and "thank you" about 500. 200 times, "Do you have a rewards card?" And 70 times, "You can enter your PIN." A public safety measure would be to authorize cashiers to say "shit" once a day. To say it kindly, softly. But to really say it: "Shit." "Shit" to the customer who asks how long it'll be. To the customer who asks if you're open. Or the exasperated customer who dumped his basket like a dump truck. "Shit" to the assistant manager who makes you recount your register. Yes. Just to say "shit." Just once. Recently, a friend told me that large retail is "nothing, no sun, no future." She's right. Hey. Keep your money! We're not gonna take it! Are you for the strike? I want cashiers to be treated better. Yeah. You want no more "nothing," "lots of "sun", and a real future. Basically. The Miss Cashier Speaks blog really got a lot of buzz. I bet she didn't expect it. It's funny. What's funny? The first time we heard "Nothing, no sun, no future," we were together. And then it shows up on the blog. What do you think? Nothing. It's a coincidence. There's no coincidence. What coincidence? Leila doesn't have a computer, and even if she had one, I don't see her writing blog posts. She wouldn't write like the blogger. That's not very nice. Maybe, but it's the truth. So if it's not Leila, and it's not me, then who? My lips are sealed. Do you like pasta? Yeah, why? -Come over for dinner tomorrow. -OK. Are you coming? I'm gonna have a cigarette. Yeah, Thomas. Yeah. Come by this afternoon, around 3. Register 14. She's blond. Get some photos. OK. Yeah. OK. Thanks. Bye. Shit, shit, shit. -Solweig? -No, no, it's not Solweig. The theater was robbed. They took all the costumes. Ah, damn. -But it's OK, Fred. -It's OK? Those costumes cost a fortune. How is it OK? Calm down. Listen... I don't want to calm down, OK? I'm gonna finish up with the cops. I have to chauffer an American tourist and his wife all day. Meet me at the garage tonight. Got it? OK. Oh, shit. Hello. Hello. SHATY -- ever heard of it? What are you doing here? Shopping. Aren't you due in 6 months? That's what Solweig said. What are you gonna do with all these diapers? I'm buying in advance. I wanted to see you. You all miss me. I'm mad about it. I miss you, too. -Hey, Leila. -Hey, Solweig. You were expecting me? -Yes. -Yes. Oh, man. -I was starting to worry. -You shouldn't have. I sure make you work, huh? It's a shame. I like doing nothing. It won't scan. It's not scanning. It's not scanning. I'm sorry, kids. Marie! How much are the extra-large magnum lubricated condoms? No, ma'am, it's OK. We're not going to get them. What do you mean? Are you kidding me? I just asked my colleague the price of your extra-large condoms, and now you don't want them. Are you nuts? But, ma'am, we don't have to. You don't have to? Of course you have to. And you, too. If you play with your pecker, protect yourself. -11.90 for a box of 20. -Thank you very much. -Oh, man! -Have a good night! But... How are you paying today? What's that supposed to mean? You think I can't pay? Just kidding! Cash. It's OK to laugh, you know. Sure, it's allowed. -Thanks. -This will be a great souvenir. I love souvenirs, too. Excuse me! -What's wrong with you? -Great. -Call a security guard! -No, are you crazy? What? I don't want to deal with Mercier again. She's right. It's not worth it. -So how are you, Leile? -Amazing. I'm dying. No job. Akim is driving me up the wall. You have no idea. -We're doing Christmas on Saturday. -Christmas? -You're Muslim. -Yeah, so what? If there's a chance to have a party, we work it out with God. -Oh? -Yeah. Are you coming? Yeah. You too? -Yeah. -Cool. I'm happy to see you're alive. It's been five days. I'm sorry, Fred. They stole the costumes, but we still have the wigs. -That's something. -Great. Great? Sounds like you don't care. What's up with you? It's her. Don't you get it? She's always on my mind. Shit. I can't get her out of my head. I can't sleep, I... I can't eat. I can't even breathe. That's normal, young man. It's beautiful. Yes, ma'am. It's beautiful, but inaccessible. Do you understand? She's inaccessible. She might be inaccessible, but she's come between us. So if you want to quit the play, then go ahead. Quit. But I'll never give up on it. You have to help me. Don't you get it? I can't otherwise. It's stronger than me. I swear if I could just talk to her, that'd be it. You're his friend, aren't you? Yeah. I've had lovers in my life. Oh la la, let me tell you. Especially one. A true gentleman. He courted me; he wrote me poems. I perfumed my letters. And I waited for him to write me back. My heart was beating out of my chest. When it hits you like that, nothing else matters. That's love. Do you understand? And it's worth all the gold in the world. There. -Have a good day. -You too. See you tonight. Solweig, I need to talk to you. OK. But not right now. I'm on break. It'll take five minutes. That's a third of my break. Isn't that a lot? This is important. Later. -Solweig. -What are you doing here? I said later. Eventually all liars trip up. And for you, I think the die is cast. But... They found the five euros. There were discounts that weren't deducted. -That's unfair. -Listen. I saw in your file that before coming here, you studied literature. So? Is that not allowed? -Is that a crime? -Neither. An educated cashier can be trouble. They think. They think a bit too much. I'm sure that management would be happy to learn you're behind this. Miss Cashier Speaks. I can make all this go away. I can turn a blind eye. -What do you mean? -Come on. Don't you get it? Just be a little nice to me. Stop! No one else is here. We have just enough time. -What are you doing? -Come on. Be nice. Just a little fun. -No. -Come on. -Stop. -Just a little screw. I'm gonna get you fired, you little slut! -Drive. -What? Drive, Fred! I knocked the guy out! Shit. If you don't work hard, you'll end up a cashier. Cashiers have to take everything. Mercier already has it out for you. How do you get by on 1,100 euros when you have three kids without jobs? I'll get you fired! Because I know I won't sleep, I sleep better. It's not starting. That piece of shit tortures you and it's your fault? Forget about it. Start the fucking car! -Got it. -Go, go. What are you playing at? What's this costume? I'm going to turn myself in. Do you enjoy blowing up people's lives? Your prince charming thing: At first I believed it. The Rolls Royce, in the snow, with the driver. Seemed so nice, right? Except that cashiers don't believe in fairy tales! You're nothing like a prince charming! You're just a loser playing a hero! I didn't ask for this! And now I lost my job. I lost everything because of you. I never want to see you again. Understand? Never! Solweig. Unbelievable! My door! Christ. -My door! -It's just a door. Don't get so upset. Look, young man. Don't believe everything a woman says when she's panicking. She's crazy about him. She told me so. Who are you? She's going to the station. -Go after her. -Yeah. -The station? -At Chapelle. -OK. -Go. La Chapelle. Where we going? Nowhere. With you, we never go anywhere. -I'm sorry, Fred. -Sorry for what? For ruining everything? For jumping ship right before the premiere? For being selfish? -No. -How are you going to act tomorrow? You don't even know your lines. -This was your idea. -What? What idea? The Santa Claus outfit. The disguise ruined everything. No. It's because you ooze defeat. -Open your window. -Why? I said open it. Unbelievable! Leave me alone. Wait! Listen. I know that... I wanted to do something good and I ruined everything. I know, but... I had to see you again. A second time. I needed to be sure. I don't know what's gotten into me. Since the other night, I... I can't think of anything but you. Right when I wake up. Every second of the day. And I dream of you, and of us. I know I sound ridiculous, and this all seems ridiculous, but... I'm sure I'm just imaging things. But since the other night, it's... It's like I had a revelation. Wait. You can't just show up in people's lives, and change everything and then disappear. Disappear. I'm sorry, man. Sorry. Look. I'm crazy about you, Solweig. How do you know my name? Charmed. I'm Charles. -Like the prince? -Exactly. Nothing more old-fashioned than Prince Charles. Can I drop you off somewhere? Good evening. Is this Solweig Antoniazi's place? I can't sign anything. -I'm not 18. -It's not that. If it's for any late payments, now's really not the time. Wait, wait. You're Anatole, right? Anatole Antoniazi. Forget about any foreclosures. I'm too young. Is that really what I look like? Not really. -You're prettier. -Oh, thank you. I'm Marie. I'm a friend of your sister. I work with her. -Can I come in? -Do you have parmesan? -Yes, I have parmesan. -Come in. Hey, Fred. You may be dismissed, chauffeur. It's nice that your sister is in love. It's... a bit of tenderness in this harsh world. Solweig could have been a teacher. -Teaching what? -English. Dad's accident changed everything. Ah, right. The accident. But... He'll come back. Right? How old are you? Almost 18. Aren't you funny! -No, I'm 10. -Oh, OK. Is the computer in there yours? Yes and no. I share it with my sister. It's our secret. My brother and I had secrets too, but really serious stuff. Really? -Like what? -Like... Top secret stuff. Information. Like secret agent stuff. Awesome. With Solweig... It's just like that. Solweig writes at night. There's other stuff but I can't say, -or it's not secret anymore. -Right. Just don't get caught. There's no way. That's where I come in. Oh really? Solweig writes, and then I cover our tracks. I change the IP addresses so it can't be traced. Of course. You look tired. -Do you start early tomorrow? -At 8. For math class. -The teacher sucks. -Really? Where's Solweig? Don't worry, she'll be here. I'll stay anyway. If anything's wrong, we'll call the neighbor. See ya, Marie. It was cool. It was cool. -Already? -Good morning. Why? There's another man in my life. I won't stand to have a rival. Anatole may only be 10, but he's quite a rival. "Young he may be, "but in the noble heart, valor's no need of years, a thing apart." So, he knows his classics. Well I'd better, since I'm playing at the theater tonight. I have to meet Fred for the last rehearsal. Tonight? -Yeah. -That's great. I don't know. "Yes, another "At the mere sound of your name might quiver. "The laurels "with which your head is wreathed "might seem..." Seem what? I never know what's on his head. Hang on. No. "Yes; another at the mere sound of your name might quiver. "The laurels with which your head is wreathed "Might seem to give warning of my defeat." "Might seem to give..." "Warning of my defeat." I'm likely to lose my job, Charles. I'll need to find something else. Don't worry. They're going to fire that asshole. Yeah. Don't worry. I have to go. Raise it up, slowly. Be careful, please. There, that's good. Stop. Too much. A little on the left. Stop. Higher on the right. There, perfect. Don't move. I love it. It's wonderful. Fred! I don't know how to thank you. I'll never forget what you did for me. I know, I know. But now, our priority is costumes. -This is great! -Listen, you're naked right now! You're all naked: Chimène, Rodrigue, the count! It's OK. We'll figure it out. I have a friend at the Comédie Française. He's not picking up, though, and they rarely lend out costumes. We need a miracle. Sir, does this belong to you? A miracle. That's our miracle. Isn't life beautiful? Isn't it? Strip naked, gentlemen! An unprecedented day for large retailers. This is Jacqueline Coquet. She's been a cashier for many years. Right now, Jacqueline, 130 supermarkets are on strike. Would you say that Miss Cashier Speaks is behind this movement? I don't know... Hey. -I'm going. See ya. -Where are you going? And you? The point of a question is to get an answer, not another question. -Where are you going? -Guess. It's a game with 22 players and the ball isn't square. Got your key? -Bye, boys. -Bye. How do you do it, Anatole? Do what? How can you be so ugly and have such a pretty sister? Over the year, all the large retailers have agreed to make a considerable effort. On that point: The time allotted for breaks is described humorously on the blog. In fact, most of these cashiers in large retail stores agree that Miss Cashier Speaks defends their cause more than the unions. What are you doing? Balthazar kicked the ball on the roof. Such a loser. Where are you going? To the theater. I'm already a little late. Can I come with you? Come on, please. Hurry up. The ardor in my gaze you see, Is of his blood, that too? What's that to me? Take four paces from here, and you will know. Presumptuous youth! Ah, have no fear, though. Young I may be, but in the noble heart valor's no need of years, a thing apart. The laurels with which your head is wreathed might seem... might seem... to give warning of my defeat. To vengeance, nothing proves impossible. Your arm's unconquered, not invincible. Bravo! Bravo! The end needs to be rewritten. And for the cover, we're deciding between horizontal and vertical. The vertical is more dynamic. That's what counts. The photo's great, Thomas. Thank you. Did you get her consent? -What consent? -To publish her photo. No. She never would have agreed. And who cares if she sues us? We've got the story of the year. Great job Virginie. Congratulations. So your undercover op went well? Like vacation, right? A dream. 250 hellos a day, three minutes of break an hour, 30 hours a week, for 850 euros a month. It was just divine. Is she raining on our parade? Excuse me? Betraying amazing women, you call that a vacation? Spending your time pretending and lying for a line in a paper? It was never vacation. It wasn't even work. It's part of being a journalist. You'll forget about it. You're a great colleague. I think you're mixing up "colleague" and "collaborator." I'm not a part of this. I don't care if you feel bad about it. You chose this profession. No one made you. Getting attached to the object of your piece isn't an error. It's a mistake. The mistake is saying "object" when these are brave, wonderful people. Well, let's do it. That was crazy. It was so good. No, the piece. You, on stage. Yeah. Fred was happy. You should have seen him. I love him. Benoit, too. He was proud of you. Really? That makes me happy. It hasn't been that easy with him recently. -He needs a father- -No. He needs a brother. It's true. You're right. We should go get Anatole from your mom's place huh? Are you coming tonight? Tonight. If it's tonight, then we've got time. All the time in the world. Solweig really fooled us, huh! She won't believe it. Akim! Stop the music. Listen, everyone! "That's how the words of Miss Cashier Speaks reached the hearts of 640,000 French cashiers." -That's us. -Yeah. Yeah! "Those resigned to indifference, to the pace, "to the conveyor belts. A weekly sale is good, "but a smile, an interaction, "is much, much better." Isn't that nice? Yeah! -Hello. -Hello. -Hey! -Hi. Solweig. -Hi, nice to meet you. -Hi. -Welcome. -Good evening. Nice to meet you. -Hello. -Hello. He's the guy with the Rolls Royce? That's him. I could just eat him up. -And this is the butler? -That's me. -Good evening. -Good evening. You'll have to get used to being famous. What? Didn't you see the magazine? Here. The piece on you is awesome. The chick who wrote it must work with us. Right? You're on the front cover. You're a star, darling. What's wrong? I knew it. What do you like better, cashier or journalist? Virginie Kesler. Even your name was a lie. I didn't want to hurt anyone. At first, I was just doing my job, and then I had to... I had to cheat to find you. Yes, I lied to you. There. No one made you. But if it wasn't me, it would have been someone else. Your writing affected people. Hundreds of thousands of people read you. Do you realize? It made us realize that we could see each other differently and live with each other. That's huge. That's why I wanted to publish your story, because... It concerns all of us. For once we were talked about. For once, we existed. And it was thanks to you, Solweig. Will you forgive her? So are we gonna bounce, or chill? Usually you shake hands. Or you hug. Yeah. I think that's better. Aziz! Music! My love. It's a long journey. I love you. 6 MONTHS LATER Mom, look! It's a fly! That's not a fly, honey. It's a mosquito. Why are you dressed up? Insecticide is on sale. Do you dress up for the fertilizer sale, too? As a cowpat? Go ahead. There. Turn it a little. Not like that... Are you stupid? We have three pyramids to do. Hurry up. Don't move. That's perfect. There. Come down, my boy. Watch it! Don't knock it down! Come here. There. Look. Isn't that wonderful? Ah, Solweig. You should be proud of yourself. -Who's that? -Who's Solweig? You just set up a pyramid of 120 books. You saw her name on the cover, and you're asking me who she is? I'm gonna be honest, Antoine. You need to be less dumb. -It's hard. -Ah, it's hard. It's hard for you, too. All you interns are tough. But it's... Come on. In a supermarket... ... and that's how you make money. That's how you meet your sales goals. -Do you follow? -Yes, a little. You got it. You understand. Solweig! He understood! May God bless you. There's still some there. Jackass.
