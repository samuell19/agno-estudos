IT IS NOW 10:07. YOU HAVE UNTIL 1:07. AND YOU MAY OPEN YOUR TEST BOOKS... NOW! HEY, MR. PATTISON, LISTEN. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE TEST WERE WRONG ON THEIR FACE, SO I WENT AHEAD AND CORRECTED THEM. THEY'RE IN THE TEXTBOOK, SO TAKE A LOOK, OKAY? THANKS. HEY, I ADMIT I DREAMED ABOUT THE OLD COUPLE LAST NIGHT. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT IT? I MEAN, THIS DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU KNOW. AND HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE DREAM? A STRONG POWER OF SUGGESTION PLANTED IN A TENDER YOUNG MIND BY A CLEVER YOUNG MAN WITH A NOVEL APPROACH TO STEALING HIS FRIEND'S GIRL. YEAH, WELL, THAT'S NOT AT ALL WHAT I'M DOING, BUT IS IT WORKING? IN A WAY. THIS IS A BIZARRE COURTSHIP. YES, IT'S VERY STRANGE. BUT LET'S PUT ALL THAT ASIDE. LET'S GET BACK TO THE ARGUING. WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH YOU? I WOULD SAY WE SHOULD GET MARRIED, BUT WE CAN'T, 'CAUSE WE ALREADY ARE. OKAY, I'M NOT SAYING I BELIEVE YOU, BUT COME HERE AND KISS ME. BOO. SCARED YOU, HUH? LOOK, MINE IS NOT THE QUESTION; MINE IS ONLY A WARNING FOR YOU TWO. JOEL IS VERY CLOSE BEHIND. LOOK, IN THAT DREAM, SHE WAS REALLY REAL. SHE SAID I COULDN'T FALL ASLEEP OR WE'D LOSE THEM FOREVER... LIKE OZ OR SOMETHING. - WHAT ELSE DID SHE SAY? - SHE SAID THAT SHE REALLY LOVES YOU. LAINIE, THAT WAS A SECRET. GOD. EXCUSE ME. SHELLEY. - WOMEN ARE NUTS. - YOU'RE TELLING ME. HEY, ASSHOLE. - HEY, HEY. - JOEL, JOEL. THE POOR GUY IS MY BUDDY. NOW IT'S BETWEEN ME AND YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, JOEL? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? STOP IT, JOEL. THAT'S ENOUGH. HEY, I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU, ALL RIGHT? I DON'T NEED IT, ALL RIGHT? I DIDN'T NEED IT LAST NIGHT. DINGER DIDN'T NEED IT THE OTHER DAY ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD. AND NONE OF US NEED IT NOW. THAT'S ENOUGH OF THIS SHIT. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. HEY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. - HEY, YOU. - THAT'S FOR ME. - YOU, OUT OF HERE. YOU, INSIDE. - I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. - YOU, COME WITH ME. - I CAN'T. COME ON. - LET'S GO. - I CAN'T GO. Dinger: WHY ME? WHY ALWAYS ME? WOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT "S.A.T." MEANT "SATURDAY AFTERNOON TEST." WHAT IS UP? OH, IT'S YOU. YEAH, IS LAINIE HOME? NOPE. DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE'S AT? I THOUGHT MAYBE SHE WAS WITH YOU, SO I GUESS THINGS COULD BE WORSE. YOU DON'T CARE MUCH FOR ME, DO YOU? WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE? I'LL BE SURE TO TELL HER YOU CAME BY. LATELY WHERE YOU FIND THAT KELLER BOY, YOU FIND MY DAUGHTER. NOW WE LIKE YOU A LOT, JOEL. WE'D LIKE TO SEE YOU IN THE FAMILY. ♪ WHERE IS SHE?

I'M NOT SURE I BELIEVE I AM WHO YOU SAY I AM OR IF I JUST WANT YOU TO WANT ME MORE. I THINK WHAT SHE WAS TRYING TO TELL US IS THAT WE CAN'T FALL ASLEEP TONIGHT OR WE COULD LOSE THEM FOREVER. BOBBY, I'M AS ANXIOUS TO MATURE AS THE NEXT GIRL, BUT I'M NOT LOOKING TO RUSH IT QUITE THAT MUCH. I DON'T THINK YOU GET IT. THERE'S REALLY NO RISK. BOBBY AND LAINIE WILL ALWAYS EXIST. WILL I STILL LIKE YOU... I MEAN, AFTER, YOU KNOW...? I HOPE SO. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU, BOBBY. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE ME EITHER. COME ON, YOU ALWAYS SAID YOU LIKED ADVENTURE. YEAH, I KNOW, BUT I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THIS. PLEASE. I NEED YOU TO DO THIS WITH ME. OKAY. I'LL DO THIS WITH YOU IF YOU PROMISE ME THAT AFTER THIS YOU'LL NEVER BRING IT UP AGAIN. OKAY, I PROMISE. SWEETHEART, - JOEL WAS HERE LOOKING FOR YOU. - GREAT. BOBBY, PLEASE, LET'S NOT CAUSE A SCENE TONIGHT, OKAY? I'LL GO WITH JOEL AND YOU GO WITH SHELLEY. WE CAN DEAL WITH ALL THAT LATER. BUT I NEED TO BE ALONE WITH YOU TONIGHT. I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU WERE. I GOTTA GO. LOOK, WE'LL BE ALONE AFTER THE DANCE, OKAY? OKAY. BOBBY. YO. TELL HIM HOW NICE HE LOOKS. NO, YOU TELL HIM HOW NICE HE LOOKS. NO, TELL HIM WHAT YOU TOLD ME. OH. UM, SON, BOBBY, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT WHAT YOU SAID LAST NIGHT MADE US DO A LOT OF THINKING. YOU WERE RIGHT. WE DON'T LISTEN TO YOUR PROBLEMS. THANK YOU. TELL HIM WE'LL TRY TO DO A BETTER JOB. UM, YOU HEARD WHAT YOUR FATHER SAID. YEAH, I HEARD HIM. LISTEN, MOM, COULD YOU TELL DAD THAT I LOVE HIM AND I LOVE YOU TOO AND I'M GONNA MISS YOU BOTH IN A WEIRD SORT OF WAY? I MEAN THAT. I GOT A DANCE TO GO TO. I GOTTA GO. WHEN HE COMES BACK, WILL YOU ASK HIM WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT? THIS IS TERRIFIC. I KNOW YOU LIKE IT CRUNCHY. HEY, WHAT, ARE YOU NUTS, MAN? - SHUT UP. - JOEL. HEY, BOBBY. HEY, KELLER, MAN, WHERE'S LAINIE? LOOKING FOR YOU. I THINK YOU SHOULD TALK TO ME. COME HERE, PLEASE. WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE'S GETTING REALLY TRASHED. THEY'LL WORK IT OUT.
