Male narrator: Well, it may not be as straightforward as that. Look at Hunter and Ashlynn. (chopping) (vocalizing) - (birds tweeting) - Boys: Hey! Hi. Nyeeah! All: Ah! Run everyone! Off with their buds. Female narrator: It seems that hearts and destinies don't always move in the same direction. "Cupid and Dexter Charming." (sighs) Cupie and Dexy! Ugh! (sighs) Hey, Cupid. (vocalizing) - (music playing) - (camera flashes) Anyone sitting here? Yes. I mean no! No one is sitting there, and yes, you should sit there. - Thanks. - Shh! Quiet in the library! The evil step-librarians are so wicked. Yeah, last week they made me re-catalogue the entire forbidden-book section. - (giggling) - Shhh! Well, look what I found. (gasps) "The History of True Hearts Day"! Thanks, Dex! You are such a sweet... Both: Shhh! And so each time a fairy tale is told... Cupid: Headmaster! My dear, I am writing my speech for... Love never waits! What are you going on about? True Hearts Day! Where... ahem... did you find that? It tells all about this totally "hexcellent" holiday that encourages everyone to follow their true heart's desire. But it hasn't been "spellabrated" in years. And never will be again! That holiday is dangerous. But... but... Some students might see it as a sign to break from their destinies. Maybe True Hearts Day is... Ahem. You are not to talk about this to anyone. Do you understand me? Yes, sir. I won't say a thing. True Hearts Day? - (music playing) - (camera flashes) I don't get it. (sighs) (gasps) Charades! 48 words. A holiday that used to be "spellabrated" in the fairy-tale world that encourages us to follow our true heart's desire but Headmaster Grimm doesn't want anyone to know about it, but you think we should "spellabrate" it anyway and throw a secret underground True Hearts Day dance? Why didn't you just say that? 'Cause Headmaster Grimm told me not to say anything. Secret dance? What if Grimm catches us? He won't. Come on! It'll be happily ever awesome! I do throw the most "hexcellent" parties. - Yay! We're having a secret True Hearts Day dance! - Shh! (echoing) Secret True Hearts Day dance! Secret True Hearts Day dance! Both: Shh! Um, you might not want to shout that. You know, being a secret and all. (rock music playing) ♪ Sparrow! He's the hottest guy, oh! (rock music playing) ♪ In the fairy tale... ♪ - Whoa! - Stop that! - (music playing) - (camera flashes) Come on, they went this way. I'm finally going to get some proof. Why do you even care? I care 'cause it's not fair. Ashlynn is breaking the royal rules with her secret romance, but she still gets a happily ever after and I don't! So you got a plan? I mean, it's not like we're just going to find them in some romantic mo... ment. - (music playing) - (camera flashes) (gasps) - (music playing) - (camera flashes) (laughs) (tinkling) - Say cheese. - Huh? Ah, curses. Oh, hey, Duchess! Sparrow. We didn't see you. - (Hunter laughs) - What's going on? ♪ You two are totally busted! ♪ Ashlynn, Hunter. I think the real question is what are you two doing here? Having a secret romantic rendezvous? We gotta find a better place to picnic. Please. You two can't tell anyone Hunter and I are secretly dating. Um, yeah, wow. Well, I'm gonna! Ash, this is going to knock you down the royal rankings. But don't worry. I'll take your place and your happily ever after. (rock chord plays) Bummer. ♪ Princess-to-be! Oh! ♪ All: Stop that! (plays one note) Cupid (filtered): Now, my Love Tale friends, this is the part of the MirrorCast where I try to solve your romantic problems. So, Fragile in Fairyland, what's in your heart? Um, well, I... Dex? I kind of... no, I do... I do have a crush on this girl named Raven. Raven Queen? You have a crush on Raven Queen? - (all gasping) - I mean Rachel! Rachel, yeah. I like a girl named Rachel. Okay, Rachel. So you like her. What's the problem? Well, whenever I'm around her, I get really tongue-tied. Oh, okay. Look, how about putting down your feelings on parchment? That is a great idea! - I'll write her a love... poem. - (all gasping) Uh, ahem, thanks, Cupid. You're the best. Bye. No problem. - (sighs) - (door opens, bells jingle) - Oh, hey! - It's Apple White! - (music playing) - (camera flashes) True Hearts Day! Aren't you just totally "hexcited"? It used to be such an important holiday on the royal calendar. Ah, love! Finding our predetermined princes. I'm sure, yeah. Oh, sweetie, what's wrong? You can tell me. I mean, we are friends forever after. I'm not sure you'd understand. What? Is it boy trouble? Oh, wow, hey! I am thirsty. Um, I'm gonna go get us a couple Hocus lattes. Double foam, extra apple caramel, right? - Troll: Uh, you work here?! - Oh! I want these in a size 74! Oh. Male narrator: And so Dexter finished his True Hearts poem for Raven. Now he just had to wait for a response. What's this? - (music playing) - (camera flashes) It's a love poem. Oh, a secret note! - (music playing) - (camera flashes) Is there anything more hat-tastic? But who's it from? "D. Charming"? (laughing) Ladies. - (music playing) - (camera flashes) Daring? I had no idea he felt this way. 'Sup, brother? Oh, gort. Male narrator: Love is very... - Female: Complicated. - Male: Yes, complicated. Male narrator: The path of love is never straight. Female narrator: Well, it was until people started choosing their own stories. Male narrator: You must admit, this is much more interesting. Female narrator: Mmm, well, let's see what happens. (door bells jingle) Hey, Ashlynn. - (music playing) - (camera flashes) What's up with the urgent text message? - Is every... - Shh! Sorry, Cedar, but I need help. - We need help. - Uh, Hunter? Shh! I'm not Hunter. I'm, uh, Gunter. Gunter Guntsman. (crickets chirping) Is this about your guys' secret relationsh... Shh! Yes, it is about... that. Duchess knows, and she's going to spell it out for the whole school. We don't know what to do. Well, I always find it's best to tell the truth. You're right, Cedar. Gunter Guntsman! I got a triple mint Hocus latte for Gunter Guntsman! Over here! (motor revving) (honking) I got party supplies! (honking) C.A. Cupid! I'm Cupid! That's me. (honking) Just sign here. Party supplies? Why, yes, party supplies um, for... Our play. And what exactly is the name of this play? - It's, uh... - All: Um... uh... - (music playing) - (camera flashes) It's called "The Play That Almost Was And Then Wasn't But Then Was." Mmm. Very well. (sighs) I don't know, Duchess. It is a bombspell, but Ash and Hunter are my friends. If you don't report on it, someone else will. (all gasping) No, they can't own it! Now I'll never get my happily ever after! Oh, hey, Duchess. (giggling) - Apple White: Ashlynn? - (gasping) You and Hunter are... are dating? But you're a Royal. And he's a Rebel. ♪ Totally awkward, oh! ♪ Female narrator: A Royal dating a Rebel? That's just not how the tale is told. Male narrator: She followed her true heart, which is kind of what True Heart's Day is all about. So, fellow fairy tales, Blondie Lockes here to give you reaction to the royally rebellious romance. I think it's "hexcellent." (sobbing) Ashlynn and Hunter decided to rewrite their destinies. What's wrong with that? Oh! I feel for them. I mean, keeping secrets is hard. - (growling) - Ahh! A Royal and a Rebel? Ha! They're from two different worlds. (roaring) - I am trying to do an interview here. - (whimpering) I'm worried about Ashlynn and Hunter. If they don't follow their destinies, their books could close... forever. (cooing) (bell ringing) Remember our quiz tomorrow on tiara size and future neck problems. Apple, we have to talk. Ash, this is hard for me, which is a first because I usually handle everything so very well. - I know. - I'm just so surprised you didn't trust me enough to tell me. I didn't think you'd understand. I guess I don't. It just doesn't make sense to me. I don't want to see anything bad happen to someone I care so much about. (honking) And so you're telling me all these heart-shaped cakes are for your play? - Yeah, the play! - Yep! You know it! They're for the really funny scene where Briar throws them at Hopper! - Excuse me? - Oh, yeah. It's such a funny scene. I just wind up and ugh! (chuckling) Very well. (both sigh) (all chattering) Hi, Ashlynn. Duchess! - What do you want? - What do I want? My own happily ever after, of course. And now that everyone knows that you're dating a Rebel, it looks like there's one available. No glass slipper for you! Hmm! So you're happy about Hunter and I dating while my best friends aren't? Maybe I did make a mistake. What? No! You're totally doing the right thing. Follow your heart and all that sappy stuff. (birds chirping) Sorry, I'm saving this for Ashlynn. (whistling) Hey, Ashlynn! Ahem. (birds chirping) Hunter, we need to talk. Uh, Ashlynn? I just... I thought this would be a good thing, showing everyone we were dating. I thought it would take the pressure off. But now everything is worse. What are you saying? My friends are upset. I don't know what's going to happen to our stories. - Yeah, but... - Hunter, I don't want anything bad to happen to us... to you. I think... I think we should break up. I'm sorry. Male narrator: And so as the sun set on Ever After High... (snoring) (sighs) Female narrator: The students were getting fairest - for the big dance. - (sneezes) Meow! (gasps) Ooh! (playing rock beat) Sparrow? I need you to help me ruin the True Hearts dance tonight. What? Why? Briar is planning it. And if I can get her in trouble with Headmaster Grimm, then there'll be a new opening in the royal ranks. You know what? I am done with you. What's ruffled your feathers? I, Sparrow Hood, the rockingest, handsomest guy in this school, can't find out where the dance is. No one will tell me 'cause I'm friends with you. Well, someone around here must know something. You really think anyone's going to tell you the truth? (pages rustling) There's one person at this school who's cursed to. (rock beat playing) (gasps) - Raven, over here. - Wow, Briar, you really know how to throw the most "hexcellent" parties. - I had some help. - Ha ha! I, uh... ...appreciate your kind kudos, fair maiden. (giggling) Hey, guys, who's D.J.ing tonight? We got the daughter of the Pied Piper. Melody Piper?! (all cheering) What up, Ever After? Ready for me to drop some True Hearts tunes? All: Yay! Then follow me. (techno beat playing) This Next Chapter Day saw a 30% rise in our semi-magical creature attendance... - Duchess: Psst! - ...rates, which, when you compare that to... Psst! Excuse me. Duchess Swan, I'm addressing the entire magical community on the MirrorNet at this very moment. I know. And I'm so sorry to disturb you. But there's something I just thought you had to know about. Which is? I hate to tell on my friends, but some students are having a secret True Hearts Day dance. Show me where. Ahh! (rock music playing) So 300 autographs later, my quill finally gives out. - But there are 100 more girls in line... - Daring? Daring? Uh, can we talk for a minute? - Of course, yes. - I wanted to thank you for that poem you left on my locker. Um, I never wrote you a poem. You didn't? But it says right here... "D. Charming." (gasps) Dexter! - Hi, Dex! - (Daring laughing) So... not exactly a happy True Hearts Day, huh? Why does my brother always get the girl? It's not fair. Maybe you should stop thinking so much about your brother and, um, concentrate on someone else. - Uh, who? - You. You spend so much time comparing yourself to Daring, you forget you're great just the way you are. - Really. - Cross my heart. Thanks, Cupid. It was Dexter! Can you believe it? Dex, he's so sweet and cute. And I'm gonna tell him that I... (gasps) (music slows to an end) I'm too late. Where is this party? Not much further. (rock music playing) Give it up for Melody Piper! (all cheering) Now since True Hearts Day hasn't been "spellabrated" in such a long time, I wanted to tell everyone what it's all about. Once upon a time, there grew a very special tree... the Heart Tree. And even if the winter was harsh and the other trees failed to bloom, the Heart Tree blossomed no matter what. And so our fairy-tale ancestors gave the blossoms to each other on True Hearts Day to show that even though it's not always easy, true love will always find a way. And so to encourage all of us to follow our true heart... (whistling) (all gasping) Make sure to give yours to someone special to you. Can I... Hunter? When I listen to my true heart, it tells me that you're my Prince Charming. Aw! But how can you be a Royal and date Hunter? I don't know. But if writing our own happily ever after means I can't be a Royal, then call me Ashlynn Ella, the Rebel! - (all cheering) - (gasps) I'd like to give this to you, Hunter, if you'll have it. Of course. (all cheering) Apple! I'm so sorry. I just had to do what... Why are you giving this to me? I might be worried about you, and I might think you're doing the wrong thing, but I want you to know that we'll always be friends, no matter what. That's what's in my true heart. Thanks, Apple. You're the best. (giggling) I know. This is literally the best day ever. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. Don't be a worry flurry. Let's party! (laughing) Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. Hmm. Hey, Cupid, have you seen Cedar? I can't find her anywhere. Oh, Cedar had something royally important to do tonight. (rock music playing) There it is. Humph! (sighs) (music continues) - Hyah! - (chord plays) Dudes, trying to practice here. Miss Swan! Detention! What? Where are they? ♪ You totally got what you deserved! ♪ Yeah. Cerise: You told Cedar the wrong spot 'cause you knew Duchess would try to get it out of her. (giggling) Yep. Then she left me a note back in the dorm telling me the real party was here. Male narrator: Now that is a happy ending. Female narrator: I have to say, my true heart agrees. (vocalizing)
