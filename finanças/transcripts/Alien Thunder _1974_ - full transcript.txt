(slow dramatic music) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (cows mooing) (man grunting) (cows mooing) (birds squawking) (cows mooing) (door bangs) - Shh, shh! You ain't keeping me, we'll have to hear all about eternia. - Inspector wants to see you. - What about? I'll be right there. - Ain't gonna be no berries for putting up this fall. Spring frost, you know? Killed all the flowers. My wife, six kids. All hungry. - How much, Napoleon? - Five. - Five? One. - God bless you. - Nope, bless you. You don't get that back to me next payday, you best of froze your own personal pin cherries, so's you don't feel the toe of my boot when you get it. - That's all we need, Indians slaughtering department cows at will. We've got to make an example of him. Stop it now. Your patrol, Sgt. Grant. - Yes, sir. - Sounding Sky encourages the boy to ignore the law and spreads gossip about me all the time. - Yes, yes, I know. And he will have to learn to herd according to rules. - I understand, sir. - The offense is serious, remember that. Dismissed. - It was the inspector's orders to bring him back, and that's what we're gonna do. - Orders don't make no sense. - Well, you're welcome to your opinion, but this is my patrol. We're gonna bring him back. - Jesus, you're stubborn. If you was to drown, they'd find your body upstream. Bringing in one Cree boy is about as dangerous as picking up a crocus. (speaking in foreign language) (dog barking) - Here's your evidence. Suppose they'll be needing that within their trials. - [Almighty Voice] It was our cow I killed. - That was a department herd cow. Slaughtering one of them is a felony. You've got to get proper permission from Mr. Valentine. You know that. - Being hungry tells us better. It's time to kill our cow. - All that herd is the queen's cattle. - The queen forgot to burn her brand, crown and scepter, on that one. - This is no time for mockery. You will have to stand trial. - Yeah huh, a proper trial, and then rot in a hole like a dead gopher. - [Malcolm] You know the law, Mighty Voice. - We don't want no trouble, you know that. - [Malcolm] You're under arrest. - So make it easier on us and them if you just take your medicine like a man. (horse snorts) - [Dan] Go on now. (wagon rumbling) (dog barking) - He coulda shot you, dad. - Nope, cause your dad had the drop on him right from the start. Many Birds was here. Almighty Voice was here. Dawning Sky was up here. And just around the teepee come Rolling Grass. And your dad put his hand on the-- - Easy, easy, easy now. Not so dramatic. Can we have some of this? - No, I'm saving this. - [Emily] So he killed a cow, his own cow. Because he didn't have food. - Indian agency cow, love. Department herd. - [Emily] Maybe they are hungry. There is so little to hunt now. - Well, they'll have to learn to herd, or they will starve. - Such a cruel country. - Once you get to know it, it's very gentle. You ever looked in the throat of a tiger lily? Prettiest speckles I ever saw in my life. Ah, the soft yellow throat of a tiger lily. (Emily chuckles) The sky, prairie sky. Once I dumped six bags of blue in my ma's tub just to see if I could get that blue. Blue of prairie sky. - Didn't you get in a lot of trouble? - Yeah, I got that too, I did. - (laughs) I think before you have ideas like this, it's time for bed, Eddie. - [Eddie] Why? - [Emily] Oh yes. - You promised me that you would tell me about-- - Edouard. - Aw. - Edouard, do what your mother tells you, please. - I'll tuck you in. - [Emily] Do you mind? - No. Up the wooden hill to bed for sure. I'll give you till I count 10. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. What comes after seven? - Dan, I'm in bed. - I'm halfways up. So I says to him, Chief Weasel Tail, you don't believe Dan Candy, and you round up every Buffalo for 100 miles around. Round 'em up, and head 'em straight for that cliff. - Were there a lot of them? - 1,000s. 1,000s and 1,000s and 1,000s. More than you ever seen in your whole life. Thicker than grasshoppers. Tit swinging cows were there. Calves bellowing after 'em. Knacker knocking old bulls roaring so's you could hardly hear yourself think. And dust, dust lifted up out of the air. It made it like night for 50 miles around. - How could you see? - With their eyes. Red lights shining through the dust. Bloodshot eyes lit up. And the smell. Smell smelt like the inside of a blacksmith shop with a million blacksmiths shoeing a million horses, 'cause on account of them running so fast their hooves was smoking. And they hit the edge of that cliff where the fence squeezed them together like that. And they went tumbling over the edge. And there came a hissing, and a blowing, and a hollering come out of there. And a big cloud of steam come up. - Steam? - Red hot hooves hitting the creek steam scalded 15 Indian braves and the ponies to death. Rest got caught in the blizzard. - Blizzard? - Mud blizzard. Yeah, steam rises. Gonna hit all of that dust up there. Dust gonna turn to mud. And mud's generally heavier than your air, so she's gonna come down. That's how come Chief Weasel Tail give me this magic vest. (chanting in foreign language) - Will you get him up? - He's doing the jail house dance. - [Malcolm] Guess his chain's too short. - He probably can't lie down to sleep. - Hey, nobody loosed his chain, loose it. Where's my coat? - I'll get it. - Careful, he's kinda jumpy out there. - That your beer? - Yeah. - Hold the door, Hershel. All righty, boys. We need fast new regulations. Cleared all cows and horses to their rightful subjects. Any renegade Indian who goes on shooting one of them don't get no proper trial, just gets hung. And we're gonna hang you in the morning, so you're gonna get a good night's rest. That's why we loosed your chain. - I gotta hand it you, pop. Very good batch. Not too powerful. Maybe even smooth. How come you ain't drinking? You know something about this I oughta know? - Said you'd appreciate it. Come on now. - Him me is gonna haul outta here. You go get your shut eye. We are going to Sadie's and surprise the girls. (Dan humming) (rooster crows) (horse whinnying) - Come on, Morris. Move out of that stall now! Come on, move! - Hey, what's all the commotion? - [Mountie] That Indian escaped, Sergeant. - Oh for the love of H, what'd he go and do that for? Stupid, where's Malcolm? - [Mountie] Couldn't find you. He went after him with a scout. - Well, where'd he go? - The reserve, I guess. - (groans) Stupid Indian. Well, mount up. (horse whinnying) Could've waited. Now I gotta go bloody chasing after you. - Sgt. Grant found out about Candy taking off them jeans. He was madder than hell. - Yeah, that Candy. She's always getting away with this. - So been so drunk, son of a bitch probably unlocked the door himself. (bird squawking) (horse hooves thudding) (bird squawks) - I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you! (gentle music) (Dan yells) I'm gonna get you! (bell dings) - [Priest] He came out to this wild prairie from a Christian home in the East. And he gave his life here. - [Malcolm] Almighty Voice, come on now, lad. You must come with me. The law is clear. It's better for you if you come without trouble. - [Priest] He gave it bravely and unselfishly in the execution of his duties for the high purpose of justice, the very foundation stones of civilization. - Don't make it more difficult for yourself. Put down that gun. - [Priest] And then Martha said unto Jesus, "Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died." In so much as it pleases our Lord in his great mercy to take unto to himself the soul of our dear brother Malcolm here departed, we commit his body to the ground in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ. (dramatic music) (gun banging) (horse whinnying) (guns clicking) (guns banging) (ominous music) (bell tolling) - You tell Almighty Voice I'm gonna bring him in. I'm gonna see him dance at the end of a rope. - You'll have to catch him. - [Dan] I'll catch him. I'll be at his funeral. - Maybe not. - Coming like some coyote after guts. We don't need your pity. If there's anything I can do around the house, with Eddie, all you have to do is holler. - Madame. (dog barking) - I guess you'll be leaving soon. - What? - [Dan] Away from here, you and Eddie. - No. Excuse me. Send Eddie over to play with Little Rupert Fisher. - How come he killed my father? - I don't know, Eddie. Maybe he was scared, I don't, I don't know. - Was my dad hurting him? - Your dad never hurt no one. Your dad was a, your dad was a laughing man. How old are you now, Eddie? You're nine, are you? - 10 in November. - We came out to prairies when I was 10, in '68, middle of the summer. Gosh it was hot, steaming hot. Tar paper roof on the outhouse all bubbled up with this sort of smoke coming off her. So sticky, dumb fool old crow got itself stuck up in it hawing and a cawing. Inside of 10 minutes, whole flock of crows circling around the way, the way they do when one's in trouble. Before you knew it, the whole roof was stuck up with crows, you know. Poor wings flapping something fearful. The outhouse sort of lifted up, settling. And my ma come out and yelled, get the axe. I got it, and cut the other logs loose from the uprights and away she went, up over the barn, heading south. And I looked back, and I looked back to where she'd been, and there was, there was my dad. He was sitting there. (laughs) He was laughing to beat the band, his trousers down around his ankles. And that's how I remember him. I, I remember him laughing, you know. And your dad. (sobs) Your. (sobbing) Oh boy. You have to let me go after him, sir. - I don't have to do anything. A good man is dead. I would gladly see you in front of a firing squad. But I want that Indian in my jail even more. Constable dismissed. I should be recommending dishonorable discharge, that's the solution. (door thuds) (chanting in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - [Dan] Bellringer, you comb through this reserve like you was looking for lice. - [Bellringer] Yes, sir. - [Dan] You've had lice, haven't you? - [Bellringer] Yes, sir. - That's how I want you to look. They warned me you wouldn't be able to track a bleeding elephant through a fresh ball of snow. Well, I'm warning you. Counting on you. - [Bellringer] Sorry, sir. (chanting in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (children laughing) (dog squealing) (women laughing) (speaking in foreign language) - He's here, isn't he? I know he is. He wouldn't leave without her. Did you tell him he's gonna get hung? I hope you did. (townspeople chattering) (gavel banging) - Trudy has the floor. - [Trudy] I'd still like to know about the town sprinkler and when we can depend on the honey wagon. - Here here. - Why don't we get rid of that bear? (townspeople laughing) - This is not a protest meeting. - This is a meeting of concerned citizens, Ezra, and nobody's mad at anything. - Ralph, you call it whatever you want to call it. - I want to hear what the man has to say. - You'll be heard. - Well, I see the inspector's come to our meeting. Would you like to come up front, inspector? Make no mistake about it. A situation like this can get out of control. - Here here. (townspeople chattering) - Well I want to say that I personally don't like the idea of sending a man like Dan Candy to arrest that Almighty Voice. - All right, Mr. Crumby. With all due respect to you and Mr. Mayor, I think I better speak to this meeting before you go any further. - [Townsperson] Well, answer some questions. - And how come Candy ain't in jail? - This is a mounted police matter. - Damn right, it is. - But we are the law in the northwest territories, and it is for us to apprehend Almighty Voice. - What the hell are you? God damn pyromaniac? - The fire? - Why don't you shoot your gun off a few times? Wave your arms and holler? - Sorry, sir. - Oh, it don't make no never mind. They probably know anyhow. (crickets chirring) - Sir, the family are refusing to cooperate at all. Why don't we go and arrest them all? - Bellringer, you could hang them upside down over an open fire, and they'd roast alive before they'd tell you when. - Yes, sir. - [Dan] We'll all wait. (dog barking) I'll see you in an hour. (chattering in foreign language) (dog barking) - Nothing. - Well, keep looking. He's around. (singing in foreign language) - You may use that chair. May be a long wait. (singing in foreign language) (crickets chirring) (owl hooting) (birds chirping) (speaking in foreign language) (geese honking) (owl hooting) (birds chirping) (woodpecker knocking) (owl hooting) (coyote howling) (crickets chirring) (birds squawking) (coyote howling) (birds whistling) (owl hooting) (birds chirping) (birds squawking) - Where's the girl? - She's right here. (man laughing) (man laughing) - [Dan] Get out. Where you come from, Bellringer? - [Bellringer] I'm was born in Goderich, Ontario, sir. - [Dan] Being from down east you wouldn't know about horse beetles? - [Bellringer] What, sir? - [Dan] They come out on the prairie at night when she goes off. Nocturnal horse beetles. Even if you keep your eyes peeled for 'em, they get right by you. Eat under the frog of a horses foot. Could eat right through an entire horse overnight while you're sitting there. The man we're after is a Cree. Cree's have got that horse beetle talent. Don't take it personal. Harold, isn't it? - [Bellringer] Yes, sir. - So if you order our patrols to hit at La Corne, that lake, one arrow. Well, I could move them down into Potash. They'd be waiting for him there. (rooster crows) Sir? - Sit down, the both of you. - [Dan] Sir, there's no food out there. I can't see him running around shooting his gun off every time he gets hungry if there's patrols out. - We can't waste special patrols. Keep everything away from one reserve to the other just because you think it might flush him out into the open. - [Dan] Well, regular patrols then. - Every outpost has been notified with full description. - I think he's probably gone from here anyway now, sir. - [Dan] He's not. - Enormous harm has been suffered. No rational man would take such foolish risk. - He was right there, 15 feet away. I almost had him. - Report to the barracks. - Sir, permission to go back out. - Get some rest first. - Why? - I don't have the men to spare for this. They're all out. And I need Bellringer here. - I'll go alone. Eddie! Hey, let me see that beauty. Can I look at your knife? Nice. Good weight to it. - [Eddie] It was my dad's. Can I have it back now? (sheep baaing) - Yeah. Keep oil on it now. - [Eddie] I know. - Will you look at this snow, eh? Coming this early like this, it's gonna be a cold winter, like the winter of '88. You know when snow gets so deep in the pockets you get a kind of blue shadow? Well, that weren't why the snow was blue in '88. '88, snow was blue with cold. I seen a, I seen a coyote froze stiff in midair in the running position. And 15 feet up ahead of him, jackrabbit he was chasing after. In midair too, hind legs drawn up underneath him, all ready for the next jump. Come spring thaw, saved that jackrabbits life. - [Eddie] Why? - [Dan] Well, your jackrabbit's smaller than your coyote. Thawed out first, give him a head start. Coyote didn't thaw out till next day. - [Eddie] Did he catch him? - [Dan] Not yet. - [Eddie] He's going to get away, isn't he? - [Dan] No, he's not. He wants to think that, but he ain't. I swear, Eddie. I swear. All right, she got everything she needs. Try and drop by and, uh, see her. All right if I drop by and see her? - Eddie] I don't care what you do. (dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) (dramatic music) (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) (wind howling) (wood cracking) - [Dan] A yokebo. Squaw's pregnant. (slow dramatic music) - Another week and she'll be froze solid. Then we get snowed in till July, right constable? River can't take much more of this. (speaking in foreign language) (bells ringing) (children giggling) (speaking in foreign language) - Dan? Mrs. Grant, she, uh, she asked me to give you this. She, uh, she was kind of hoping you'd drop by. You know, I think she's got a lot of pluck, you know? Maybe you could go over for just a little while? Well anyway, she uh, she said I should say Merry Christmas. - [Dan] Talcum shaving box. - Merry Christmas, Dan. I mean, from me. Merry Christmas. - Yeah, Merry Christmas. (wind howling) (chanting in foreign language) (upbeat drumming music) (dramatic music) - Where's he at? Where? He's gone? Tell me. He's gone? I'm gonna make you talk. - You've become hunter with nothing to hunt. - Is he still here? Tell me, damn it! You've gotta tell me! (train chugging) (train whistle blaring) - [Mr. Hendrickson] We saw him back there about 15 miles, an Indian. - [Dan] Open the throttle, head back. - [Mr. Hendrickson] I can't, this is CPR Railroad. - [Dan] Mr. Hendrickson, I said head back. - [Mr. Hendrickson] We have a schedule. - [Dan] Back! - You can't take over this train. The only thing that stops this railroad is a hotbox wreck or an act of God. - Mr. Hendrickson, you just took on board a one man act of God, now you open that throttle! - [Dan] All right. (train chugging) (train rumbling) (train whistle blaring) - [Dan] For Christ's sake, shut it up! (train chugging) (man speaking in foreign language) (woman speaking in foreign language) (train whistle blaring) (train chugging) (hammer banging) (horse hooves thudding) Well, Napoleon Royal. How's your wife? Right pleased to see ya. (horse whinnying) - No red coat anymore? - [Dan] Nope. Don't go with the way I'm living. - I heard they hunt those deserters pretty hard. - Well, rest your worries, Napoleon. I ain't no deserter. Not yet. - That's good. - [Dan] How much you want? - It would really make me sad if they started to hunt you too now. - (laughs) Make your pockets sad. How much? - Maybe two? - Maybe we better figure out how you are ever gonna pay me back. - Uh, I'll work for you. Just have to ask. - Since I come to Duck Lake Post, I've loaned you, and you have not paid back to me, $22. At constable's pay, assuming you ain't been promoted, constable pay, that will be, not counting Sundays and holidays, roughly speaking 15 days work. Well, that's my count. You're gonna have to settle it, well? - You have explained it very well. - One, $1, take it. - [Napoleon] What is it? - It's my map. Duck Lake, Potash, One Arrow. It's where I've been, where we're going. - Looks like we've been all in the same place all the time. - Yeah. (woman speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) (young woman panting) (young woman moaning) (speaking in foreign language) (bird squawking) (dramatic music) (young woman moaning) (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) (speaking in foreign language) (baby cooing) (speaking in foreign language) (bird squawking) (dramatic music) - [Napoleon] Tired. - [Dan] Uh-huh. - [Napoleon] I'm tired too. - [Dan] Oh yeah. You still owe me six days, you know. - [Napoleon] Today we didn't start anywhere, we didn't get anywhere. - [Dan] Well that means we ain't losing any ground. - [Napoleon] My horse is confused. It thought it set out for Duck Lake this morning. It thinks it's been riding too long without resting. - [Dan] Get a smarter horse. - [Napoleon] We ain't gonna get anywhere like this. We've got nothing to show for all this hard riding. - [Dan] Over the lower east, Napoleon. You know they've been coming after us past two days. (horse whinnying) Bastards. I got 'em now. Those bastards, I got 'em now. Sharp, ain't they, sharp. Mulberry thorns. Thorns through their hands, in their feet. Through their throats, trapping 'em. Trapping 'em just like they trapped Malcolm. (coyote howling) - [Napoleon] It's him. (coyote howling) (speaking in foreign language) - Mulberry thorns all around, grab 'em. - [Napoleon] You're crazy, let's get out of here. - We got 'em, I know it. (birds squawking) They are coming here. They're gonna come in here to kill us. They won't do it from out there, I know 'em. They won't do it, they want to do right up close. Nice surprise. Well, they're gonna get Dan Candy's surprise, that's what they're gonna get. (crickets chirring) (Dan panting) Look, look! - [Napoleon] Just two whitetail deers looking for a place to sleep. - [Dan] Shut up, come on! (owl hooting) - [Napoleon] What are you doing? - [Dan] Firewood, firewood. - More fire? - Show them how near we are. Let's get 'em down for the night. - You're crazy. - [Dan] Haul some wood. Good, keep it going good. (wood banging) Napoleon, give me a hand here. Napoleon? Napoleon? Napoleon? (footsteps crunching) (fire crackling) (horse whinnying) (horse hooves thudding) (Dan screaming) (guns banging) - Go, for Christ sakes, Go! Get! Get on, get going! No! No! I've got him trapped down there! Get back, you bastards, go! - [Mountie] Get back! - Get back! - Spread out carefully. - [Dan] Get them outta here! What are you doing here? - Bellringer! I want you spaced around that block, come on! - [Dan] Get 'em out of here. I'm bringing him in, I'm bringing him in. I'm finishing it, I'm bringing him in. You bastard, what did you bring them for? - I said it's over! You have done a good job. We're all relieved it's over. It's in our hands now. - I'm bringing him in. I'm bringing him in. Get 'em out of here. - Constable! Control yourself, or I will have you return to the barracks. Go with Tommy and Hershel. - [Mountie] Do you swear to uphold the laws of our land? - [Inspector Brisebois] Move in quick! They must not escape! - [Mountie] Do you swear to uphold the laws of our land? Attention, fire! (gun bangs) (guns banging) (gun bangs) (Mountie yells) (guns banging) - [Dan] He ain't said nothing about taking him alive. You need to arrest him! (guns banging) (Mountie groans) - Get out of there, get out! (gun bangs) - [Mountie] Hey you, hurry up. - Get them some help. - Two have been killed. They've all gone crazy. Get 'em out of here, let me do it myself. - Please control yourself. - Jesus Christ! Cover me! (guns banging) Bellringer? (gun bangs) You all right? You look like an elephant stepped on you, come on. (children yelling) (train whistle blaring) (children chattering) (train whistle blaring) (train chugging) (bell ringing) - On with it Sergeant Major. Gather the horses, ready for march. - [Mountie] Sir. (children chattering) - Bob. - The German detachment's on it's way, sir. - Fine, excellent. All you civilians out of this area. (people chattering) Forward march. (triumphant music) - [Dan] There's 100s of them. They got you surrounded. Come out the far end, you'll be safe. Almighty Voice, I'll get you a fair trial! I promise you! Northeast end. I'll be waiting for ya. (triumphant music) (men speaking in foreign language) (triumphant music) - Whole thing sloppy, beginning to end, two dead! - Please, sir. - Sit, gentlemen. Got the men, horses, and sheer numbers. - Grounded sir? - Of course! Bring in two troops either end of the grove. Catch them in the cross charge. Confuse and overwhelm! Gentlemen, thank you. (dramatic percussive music) (triumphant music) - Attention, at once fire! (triumphant music) (Mounties yelling) (guns banging) (Mountie groans) (guns banging) (Mountie yells) - [Malcolm] Reform, charge again! Don't worry about me, charge! Keep attacking. (triumphant music) (Mounties yelling) (guns banging) (guns banging) (Mountie groans) - [Mountie] Get the stretchers! Four men cover! (gun bangs) (triumphant music) (gentle music) - Take the strain around here, here. Easy, easy. All right, steady now. (singing in foreign language) (man speaking in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (man speaking in foreign language) - What are the plans now, sir? - What are the plans? Use the 79-pounders, of course. No choice. (Malcolm mumbles) (Malcolm laughs) See they're set into position. - [Inspector Brisebois] There is no choice. Count the dead and the wounded. Just count them. The decision is made. - What about Sounding Sky? - [Inspector Brisebois] What about him, Constable? - Let me talk to him. - God. - Well it's a chance! Look, there's 47 mounted policemen down there, and special constables all sworn in proper. And half the people in Duck Lake district. Turned it into a circus. Your boys don't have a hope in there. Sounding Sky, do it. He's gonna use them cannon. They're going to be killed, Sounding Sky. They're gonna die! - [Sounding Sky] Something must be no good still. - [Dan] Get him out of there. - [Sounding Sky] So that you can hang him? - [Dan] Bastard. (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) - Attention, commence fire! (cannon bangs) (explosion booms) (explosions booming) Fire! (cannon bangs) (explosions booming) Fire! (explosions booming) Fire! (explosions booming) (explosions booming) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (gun bangs) (gentle music)
