Huh? No TV this morning, huh? Hey, Eric! You're missing Robots versus Aliens. Let's go. Time to get up. Come on, big guy. Second grade awaits. Eric? Eric? I need help here. Something's wrong with my son. I'm sorry. You'll have to wait. Take him down there. We've interrupted your scheduled program to bring you breaking news across the nation. Headline News is your number one source of news coverage. Nurse! Somebody, please! ...there have been numerous reports, this morning coming from both Japan and China regarding the same state of events. Jean! David? What's happening here? Um... We, we don't know. They started pouring in two hours ago. The doctors are doing tests. Stay here. I'm going to see if I can find a bed for Eric, okay? I'll be... I'll be right back. ...it appears to be across the globe. For those tuning in, at approximately 5:00 Eastern Standard Time, all children around the world under the age of nine have, for some unknown reason, been cut off from their surroundings. Though they appear to be stable for the moment, they exhibit signs of deep catatonia and are unable to communicate. We still have no explanation as to what might be causing this. We go live now to our reporter Katarina Moore who's standing by with the Surgeon General. Katarina? The President, in Florida today, is en route back to the White House to address the nation. Air Force One will be landing... Whatever is happening has just escalated... Doctor! Doctor! What is going on in this hospital? Eric! Looking back at a decade of fear. A fear that the children of this world will never open their eyes again. Ten years later there are still no answers. What caused this and why? Fundamentalist groups believe we are facing extinction. And who's to say they're wrong, when every child born in the last 10 years has been born comatose. People keep trying, but now with the new birth control laws on the horizon, extinction may be a reality. Medical institutions around the globe race to find a cure. Last year's upset, Korea, claiming to have awoken a study group of 10, sent out a surge of hope. The story, of course, later debunked as a hoax. Korea's newborn genome project was shut down, and hopes came crashing. But hopes for care center lobbyists skyrocketed. Business is booming with over 80 percent of the nation's children in care center facilities. Might want to invest now. As the stock market's held steady at 3,000 since the depression ended, you most likely will need the extra cash. Our 19-year-olds are heading off to college this year, and they'll say farewell to their high schools forever. Those doors will close behind them, but new ones will open. These kids, who were spared by the crisis 10 years ago, have nothing but opportunity ahead of them. Youth is a hard thing to come by these days. Just one moment, please. What do you want? I want to do whatever it takes to make things right. That all? And I need a place to stay. You can stay on the couch. It's the best I can do. I appreciate that. How's Eric? So how do you like your nephew? He's a lot bigger than the last time I saw him. Yeah, he's bigger, stronger. This stuff must have cost you a fortune. No more than a college education. Ten years' worth of Christmas and birthday presents. People keep saying they're shut off from the world. It doesn't mean he's not taking things in. They're maintaining themselves. They're staying strong. For 10 years. That can't be for nothing. I know he's in there somewhere. Fighting to get out. And when he decides to wake up, I want my face to be the first thing he sees. I've gotta get something to eat. I'm gonna go home. I'll be back after seizures. Have fun. Oh, yeah. What are you doing here? Well, I came to see you. Hoping maybe we could talk. There's nothing to talk about. I know I was wrong. I shouldn't shut everybody out like... No, you shouldn't have. Come on, you're my wife. Ex-wife. Jean, I think I would've died if you'd seen me in there. I know how hard it is to look at someone in prison and not see past what they've done. You have no idea what I would've seen. I need this from you, Jean... You know... I need someone to look at me. I'm not that someone. Hey, can you cover my shift Saturday? He do this every day? Twice. It's getting harder and harder to hold him down. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. I'm here. It's okay. I'm here. How long is this gonna go on? Huh? You can't break into people's homes. They think you're robbing them. We don't rob. Cal. Finish this, would you, man? I was wondering when you were gonna check in. I thought maybe I'd have to go out and find you. How'd you luck into being my parole officer? Oh, luck had nothing to do with it. Hmm. 19-year-olds. Most kids their age are gone by now. Went off to the big city. There's lots of opportunity when you're the last of your kind. But these two? They broke into a house tonight. Into a kid's room. It's not the first time, either. What do they do with them? Talk to them, hang out. I don't get it. So much for the last generation. But, hey, at least the vandalism rate's down, right? So what's your plans? Uh, well, I'm not quite sure. Really, I figured I would get readjusted first. Find a job. Let me see your papers. I'm gonna expect to see you in here twice a month. Hmm? And, Tom, not in cuffs. Tom Russell. What, you break out? No. Parole. So, how you been, Sam? Good. Good. I must admit, though, I miss that Spartan high school football. I just saw your sister. Yup. How'd that go? As well as can be expected. Why? It was a bar fight. Tommy, you went after that guy like you had nothing to lose, but you had everything to lose. You were married. You were going to college. You had your whole life. Why would you do it? It doesn't much matter, does it? A man's still dead. It's good to see you again, Sam. In our next segment, we will be serving the often destructive wing left by the UN Security Council's unanimous decision to enforce a worldwide ban on childbirth and the UN's embrace of state-sponsored, involuntary abortion programs. Questions are still lingering whether the UN and its willing members have the manpower, the firepower and resolve to follow through on their pledge to crack down on... Meanwhile, in Eastern Europe, protests turned violent... ...they're standing against the new laws being passed which will ban sanctioned births at hospitals across the United States. People attempting pregnancy could now face jail time in 36 states across the US. Peaceful demonstrations quickly turned to violence. Medical insurance in New York and Boston is now covering full cost of any birth prevention... The Great Depression. Sorry? It's about the Great Depression, isn't it? Oh. Yeah. Um, and about family, hardship, faith. Oh. I thought it was about the Great Depression. I wanted to... Thanks for... Up there with Eric. No problem. I noticed the porch is a little bit beat up. The railing's falling apart, you know. I was... was thinking I--I could fix that for you, if you wanted. It's all right. I'll see you in the morning, Tom. Hey. It's also about hope. Hey, Davy? Hey, Davy, something's going on. Wake up. Davy, Eric's not in his... David! No! No, no! Hey, let go of me! Calm down. It's me. Calm down. Oh. I was driving when I heard on the radio. I was right around the corner, and I thought you and David... What did you hear? I thought that maybe you could help. What did you hear? What's going on? What's going on? They're awake, man. All of them. Just like that. But that doesn't explain this. Well, okay. They're awake, and they're in a really bad fuckin' mood. I'm not joking here. Well, I'm not joking! What, you think I got all the answers? I'm not like a freaking newscaster. We gotta get out of here. Jean's working the late shift tonight. What you doing? I'm getting my tire iron. No, don't do it! No! Hold--Hold on. He's dead. Shit. The radio's dead. What are you guys doing here? They think we're one of them. All right, let's go. Come on. Get out of here, now. What about you? We'll be fine. Go! Uh-oh. Give me the keys! Well, I'm not built for this shit. I tell you that. Who's there? It's all right. You can lower your club now. How many people are in here? There's eight of us altogether. What's going on outside? Are the police getting things under control? Oh, we haven't seen any police. What do you mean, you didn't see any police? We called them. Don't let them take my soul. He's bleeding internally. Don't let them take my soul. It's all right, Dr. Jenkins. Nurse Raynor will be back soon. Nurse Raynor? Where is she? She went to get some supplies. Where? Whoa. Whoa, Tom. Tom. Tom! I want to go. Let me go. Stay and look after these people. I'll be right back. Take care of these people? There's too... Fuck. I think they saw me. He's dead. Okay, that ought to do it. That ought to do it. Okay, we gotta go. We may not be ready, but we gotta go now. I can't do this. Yes, you can. Go. He went away. Thank God. Should we stay here? I don't know. I don't feel safe. We should just get going. We should stay together. I'm just gonna look for an exit. What did you do to him? What did you fuckin' do? What was in that? Morphine. I need to thank you for that. Don't bother. He'll be up again in a few hours. If he must. Oh, God. Sam. It wasn't my fault. I did everything I could. No. God, Sam, all of them? Hey! What are you guys doing here? We want to come with you. No. They caused all this. It's the right thing to do. Where are they? I don't know. We slipped away. The kids don't know we're not like them, but it's only a matter of time before they figure it out. We don't know that. It's too dangerous. Well, come on. Anyone else here? I don't know. There may be. Nathan and my wife are outside. We should get you out there, and then I'll come back and look for others. - I'll go with you. - Okay. Whoa! Whoa! She's not one of them. She's not one of them. Tell him your name, honey. Tell him your name. Claire. That's Claire. See? See, that's Claire. All right? All right? So you can let go. Everything is fine. Let's get out of here! Let's go! Let's, let's go! Jesus Christ. Cal? Nora! Stay! Stay behind the truck! Claire? Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Go, go, go! They're coming! Oh, God! Oh, Jean! Oh! Oh, God Almighty! Oh, Jean! Oh, God! Oh! I need a knife. Jean! Jean! Here. Is there something I can do? I, I could use a damp cloth. Okay? - Sam. - Jean, is it bad? Oh, Jean, don't take it. Don't take it. It'll be all right. It'll be all right! One, two, three! Oh, God! Oh! Oh, God. I-Is it real bad? It's just a scratch. Is it bad? Oh, God! Let me borrow your flashlight. I'm gonna check the rest of this place out. Just don't knock me out. How bad is it? Bad enough. How soon before we can move him? An hour, maybe two. There's an Air Force base about 40 miles from here. The last report I heard said it was secure and taking people in. As soon as you're ready, we'll, we'll head there. Shit. Stay here. Tom? Oh, my God. That's my daughter. Alexis? Oh, you're bleeding. You're bleeding. It's Tom's blood. Oh, no, I have to help her. That's not your daughter anymore. No, let me go. I have to help her. Stop! I have to help her! No, no, no. Nora, listen to me. Listen to me. She's awake. Cal, she's awake. I know, honey. I know. But right now, Alexis is dangerous. Honey, she'd hurt you. Maybe even kill you if she has the chance. I know this is hard. It's hard for me, too. Baby. Hey, guys, I think we might have company. What the hell are they doing? Oh, my God. They've got someone. God. It's Jim. They got the preacher. We gotta do something. We can't let them know we're here. Back door. Come on. Let's go. Oh, God. No. I'm not ready. No. I'm not ready. Why didn't she come with us? Because she trusts them. Back at the care center she said something about us having caused all this. What did she mean by that? We always just thought the world was a pretty shitty place. We figured the kids just didn't want to be a part of it anymore. And now that they're awake? Maybe they decided they wanted to come back. Just not to the same world they left. I wanted you to see this. It was Jim's diary. He stepped down about two years ago and never said why. Hmm. Um, read the last thing he wrote. "Last night I dreamt I was lowered "to slumber in the hands of children." Go on. "They whispered in my ear, and the words were familiar. "The kingdom of heaven is near, "and should anyone offer their soul to one of these children, "he will deliver those who, through fear, "are subject to slavery all their lives." Tell me something. What happened with Jim, the boy putting his hands on his face. You've seen that before. How many times? Every time. What have you got? I found canned food. It's expired, but... All right, we'll load up, find Claire, get to the Air Force base. How close are we? Almost there. Good. Alexis. Alexis. Alexis. Oh, it is you, isn't it? Oh, I knew it. My baby. Is he all right? Nora. Why? Cal? Mom? Mom? Mom. Get back inside. Get back inside, now. How the hell did they even figure out how to do that? They're learning. Look, they couldn't have gotten to all the cars in town. Maybe. Unless, what one kid learns, they all learn. Well, if that's true, then then where are we gonna find a car that runs? I think I know where to start looking. Davy's truck is in his garage. It's worth a try. I'm gonna get the truck. I'm gonna come back. That's the plan. Hey. When you come back, you bring me some beer? Okay, Sam. You take care of him. Come on, go. Go. Let's go. God. You son of a... What have you got there? Body of Christ. Do you want some? Sorry. So, you got any ideas about what's causing all this? All this? This. Kids. The past 10 years. Everything. I don't know. I always did kind of like the alien theory, though. Yeah. Do you think it's aliens? No. I just like the idea that it could be. Yeah, I always liked that one, too. Nathan? Maybe it means Jean and Tom... Not unless they brought some friends with them. Oh, shit. I gotta get something. Give me your gun! Shit, they're coming down. Our father in heaven Hallowed be thy name You know what? It looks all right. The front door. The left-hand side, there's a hook. The keys should be on it. You want to give me a hand with this? Yep. Just jump on the other side. No, we've push it. We gotta lift. The thing's here. It's not gonna if you slide it. This. Watch. What was... So, did you find them? Claire, Claire, Claire. How long have they had guns? A couple of hours. How many kids? All of them. Sam. Come on. Sammy. Let's go. Jean. You want to say something? Once we get across the bridge, it should be a clear shot from there to the Air Force base. No other towns between here and there. Stay down! Get me the morphine. Jean? I'll get it myself. We need more weapons. No. Come on, we need to keep moving. Help me with the barricade. I'm going back. There's gotta be weapons at the sheriff's station. Maybe the kids haven't found them yet. We don't need weapons. We need to get out. We have to kill them before they kill us! We can't escape unarmed, especially without a friggin' truck. Listen. All we need to do is get across the bridge. There're no houses between here and the base. If we leave now, we can make it. There's no reason to go back to town. They killed Sam! What do you want? You want revenge? If they all deserve to die, then shoot me. I killed someone's brother, Jean. Shoot me first. I'm out of bullets. Jean, don't do this. I can't go with you! Come with me. I can't lose her again. "...and should anyone offer their soul to one of these children, "he will deliver those who, through fear, "are subject to slavery all their lives." Don't let them take my soul. ...putting his hands on his face. I'm not ready! I'm not ready! How many times? Every time. What the hell are we gonna do now? We need something to fight with and take them by surprise. They're probably armed, we don't know how many. What else are we supposed to do? I go. No. No. No way. I still blend in. I'll pretend like I'm helping them. No. No. Too dangerous. I wasn't asking for permission. We need these weapons. She'll be fine, Kip. Jean? It's me. It's me. Claire thought she could blend in. He came up behind me. It's Okay. He came up behind me! It's Okay. We gotta get out of here. No! No! I wanna stay here. No. I wanna stay here. I wanna stay here. I'm tired. I'm tired. I know. I know. I know. I am, too, but we need to keep moving, all right? We can rest when we get to the Air Force base. We gotta keep moving. Come on. We will get out of this alive, I promise you. But you gotta trust me, all right? Look at me. I want you to sit down. Okay? Can you do that? Jean, can you do that? They're my kids. All right, now, close your eyes. Jean, close your eyes. It's all right. Close your eyes. There you go. Think of a time when you felt safe. When you felt hope and peace. Are you there? Yes. The day after our wedding. That's good. That's real good. We talked about having kids, remember? Yes. Yeah. We wanted to offer them the best parts of ourselves. Yes, I remember. That's what we need to do right now. All right? Okay. It's not just what we say and do, Jean. It's everything we are. Everything we think and feel. That's what they take from us. That's what spreads. Yes. All right? It is. We'll always be together, Jean. You and me. All right? I'm ready. Last night I dreamt I was laid to slumber by the hands of children. They whispered in my ear, and the words were familiar. The kingdom of heaven is near, and if anyone should offer their soul to one of these children, he will deliver those who, through fear, were subject to slavery all their lives.
