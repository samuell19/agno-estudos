[MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHS] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] [LAUGHS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Do not worry, mister. You shall be all right. I know your beautiful huts, and I'll take you there. Boss. [GROANS] I killed his whole family. I had him. He fled. We have to get him. I want them out of my land. I'm the ruler of my land! Easy, woman. I'm sorry, sir. [PANTS] My name is Lara. What should I call you? Talako, mistress. Talako. [JOYFUL MUSIC] Woman! What's the matter? I'm all right, sir. You've been acting strange. Again with your scribbling. No more! [GRUNTS] [SOBS] Take him! [GRUNTING] Please, sir! Please! Harlot! Whore! Take her to the convent. She's to remain there until she repents. Please, let him go, please! I'll deal with this creature. Talako! I'm so sorry. Sir, please me go. Please, sir, let me go, please. [INAUDIBLE] Please, reverend mother, help me, please. Please. Please. [SOMBER MUSIC] My dear diary, I am so afraid of what Redbeard might do to my new friend Talako. He's is so gentle, so naive, strong and handsome too. I pray for him. And I shall not lie to you. When I touch his face and feel his smooth and bronze skin, I felt this passionate longing, one I never felt before, and felt my blood boiling, burning inside of me. And his kiss... I am a sinner. Perhaps I deserve to be damned. But not Talako. Ave Maria, Gratia Plena, Dominus Tecum, Benedicta Tu, [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER] [GROANS] [BELL CHIMING] [GASPS] [SOBS] [PRAYING] [GRUNTS] 1, 2, 3, push. [SCREAMING] I see the baby. Keep pushing, come on. Push, push. Come on, you can do this. Come on. Welcome to the world, Lara. [GASPS] Lara, no! Lara, what's wrong with you? Where did you get this? You know daddy loves you. I know, daddy. And I know who you are too. OK. I understand. But it's happened again. She keeps drawing these awful creepy images. I don't know what to do. I don't know. I need to understand the situation, learn to deal with it. What am I to do, Dr. Robbins? She spends hours drawing Indians, faceless monsters, and it's always the same terrifying images. No, they're not. They're my friends. They're your friends, huh? How'd you meet them, Lara? In my dreams. They hate him. Who? My daddy. Lara continues to baffle me. I'm convinced it's a psychotic disorder. We ran several tests, but with her abnormal thinking and her nightmares. I'm scared. I am. I don't know what else to do. She's smart, good grades, and these episodes come and go. Does Mr. Smith spend a lot of time alone with her? No, he's so busy with work. We try to spend as much time as possible. You're doing the best you can. I'll continue with the cognitive behavioral therapy. It helps. Mrs. Smith, are you or Mr. Smith a part of a generational line of Native Americans? No. Why do you ask? Oh, great spirit whose voice I hear in the wind and whose breath gives life to this whole world, hear me. I am weak. Protect this child. [NON-ENGLISH PRAYING] Ouch! For Christ's sakes, Lara! What is this? Lara. What is it, princess? What's wrong? He's not my father. [SIGHS] [LAUGHS] [PANTS] The pills are not helping and the nightmares are becoming more and more vivid, real. They are only bad dreams, Lara. No, they're nightmares. And they're so damn real. And I still want to kill him. I really do. I'm supposed to love him. He's my father. What about your breathing? I'll show you. I'm going to recommend CBD. I think we should try it. What? Yes, I've been studying CBD for a while now, and I've been treating some of my patients with psychosis and anxiety. It's been very effective, Lara. OK. Let's do it. I don't see why not. So basically, your doctor's recommending CBD oil. And we have a whole bunch of flavors with that. So we have our natural, mint, French vanilla, and pumpkin spice. I guess I'll take the pumpkin spice. Awesome, it's a great choice. You can actually use it in coffee or tea. It actually helps a lot with stress, anxiety, and depression as well. It's a really great product [INTENTIONAL ECHOING] CBD oil? Yes. Can I try it? Sure. Hey, not so much. You only need a drop. What if... [COUGHS] Fuck! What's wrong with you? [PANTS] Fuck. Let me know that next time, you're going for the kill. [PHONE RINGS] Hi. What is up with your face, girl? Are you OK? Did you try the CBD yet? Yes. OK, and how do you feel? I feel great. The anger is still around. I almost killed David. What? Really? I thought you'd be excited. Like we're finally driving to St. Augustine to work on your spooky project, you know. Can I call you later? My parents want me to have dinner. Bye. OK, bye. You want to eat? Yeah, sure. I'm nervous about this trip. I wish you would change your mind. No wonder why she can't breathe. Let her have a little fun, make mistakes. David and Luke will watch out for her. Driving's too long. Worrying is not going to help and neither is saying no. She's already made up her mind. She's not going to change it. She's decided. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Hey. Come on in. Hi. You know, I was thinking that since we're going on this trip together, maybe you and I could talk, the two of us alone together in St. Augustine. Oh, Luke. You're too young for me, sweetie. I mean, you're always on my mind. I dream about you all the time. Oh, really? You do? That's so sweet. OK, OK. I'll go ahead and pack my bags take a seat. Lara, Nita's here. Hi, Nita. Oh. Hi, Mr. Smith. Nice scarf. I don't think it would suit you very well. [MUSIC PLAYING] Yo, what's going on? Oh this thing we. This is so beautiful. Hey, are you staying at the haunted house? Yep. Built on land where the Pirate Redbeard once lived. Are you afraid of the spirits? Get ready, my friends. I recently read that this whole town is haunted. People have seen things, spirits. Can we change the subject? We all know that. Well, well, Nita. If I didn't know any better, you're scared of ghosts. If there's any in your room, I'll come deal with them. Shut up, Luke. He's so annoying. I know. [MUMBLES] [LAUGHTER] (SINGING)... we can grab a glass. I'mma let you hold the yatch, play what you like. If you're looking for a ride, I can be... Lara, why are we stopping here? Lara? Did you say something? No. I guess you want to sleep with one eye open in this place. Come on, Luke. This is beautiful. Like you? Hello, Mrs. Smith. Welcome to Santiago's team. Hi. They mentioned no one when I rented this place. I am Jessica, the caretaker. I have three large rooms waiting for you and your lovely friends. No wandering the house, please. We have lots of old stuff in here. Caretaker? Well, as long as she doesn't bother us. Come on. [EERIE MUSIC] So kinky. Are you cold? I'm freezing. As a witch's nips. Jesus! Oh, no offence. Hi. Nice... nice place you have. Where did she come from? Where did she come from? Freaky. So you're like the caretaker? Well, I like to think of myself as curator of bad things. What? Oh, don't forget, this place is full of museum pieces. You break one of them, you become one of them. I guess this is the boys room. You have two beds. Is there anything else you need? Thanks. This is nice. I hope you guys are not scared of ghosts. People have seen them here. I've heard. But we're not scared. We're not. What kind of things have you heard? Luke, don't be weird. A native tribe was massacred close by. Their spirits... they come and visit us on nights like this. Dude, she's hot. Hot and weird. Oh, come on. [CHANTING] What's up with Lara lately? She's acting weirder than her usual, you know. We committed to come along and support her. And that's exactly what we're going to do. I mean, I know how she normally is. But her obsession with this Talako shit is just way too much. I mean... [INAUDIBLE] Hey. Hi. You OK? I just had a really weird feeling that someone was following me on my run. I mean, you're probably just overworked about all this ghost talk in this town, it's all. It's all so weird. And this Jessica caretaker or undertaker or whatever she is, it's also bizarre. Speaking of the devil. Good morning. Hi. Hi. I she OK? Yeah, she's just working on her writing. Oh, she's a writer. Yeah, she is. She's writing about the Timbuktu natives who lived here like 300 years ago or something like that. Oh, they're still here. In spirit, it lives. Oh, [LAUGHS] Right. Guarding their sacred land. From what? From the man that killed them. Great. That's awesome. Yes. Interesting. Yeah. Hello, everybody. Welcome. I'm Sophia, your guide for today's tour. I'm going to tell you all about the spooky things and places that make St. Augustine so scary. How is everyone doing? Huh? Great. Excited? Are you ready for our fright scene tour? Any questions? No. Yeah. Are we going to see any real ghosts today, Sophia? Good questions. Yes, yes, absolutely. Our tour today includes the haunted history of every spot. And best of all, you're going to hear some audio recordings of real ghosts. Are you ready? Yes? Let's go then. Welcome to the most haunted graveyard in all of Florida. Buried here are many of the pirates who took this land from the natives. Yes, some say the spirits of those natives remain seeking restitution. Look around, but be respectful. And don't stray too far. The best may catch up with you. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [LAUGHS] OK. OK. I'll talk to you later then. All right. Wow. You're a busy woman, huh? I'm a very busy woman. Why aren't you hanging out with the others? I'm not interested in ghosts though. More so interested in real people. Oh. Like you. I bet you have a lot of stories to tell of. You bet I have. No, man. Stop. I'm working right now. I saw you looking at me. OK, I'll play the game. You want to come with us for drinks later? [CHANTING] Lara? Lara? Lara, are you OK? Lara? Lara. I'm fine. What happened? I'm OK, guys. Oh, thank God she's OK. Of all the places. People have experienced some crazy stuff at this grave. They say a woman hanged herself many years ago and was laid to rest right here. But the church didn't approve what she had done. An unmarked grave. What? What? Knows has been so. Oh, my God. [CHANTING] [SCREAMS] Who is it? Yo, Luke. What's with her today, man? She's giving you the looks, bro. Must be the weather in St. Augustine. [LAUGHS] Man, she's just doing her own thing. Hey, Jessica came to our room early to drop some towels. She asked for you. Wait, she asked about me? She does. Dude, she can drop her towel anytime. [LAUGHS] No, this is no joke. Seriously. Well, I really like Nita. But dude, she's always playing these games. Hey, man. You are not a PlayStation. Got that right. (SINGING)... the heart [INAUDIBLE] can't get through cause you don't understand. [LAUGHTER] God, Nita. No. Why did you let me keep drinking? You kept on dancing and ordering that. Whoo! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. OK, OK, Luke. Wow, look at that fountain. You guys want to go for a swim? No, no, no, no, no, no! [LAUGHS] Nina, Nina. Nina, you got to stop this. Oh, my God. Hey, you're OK, all right? Bed time. I'm going to use the bathroom. [EERIE MUSIC] No, no. What are you doing, Luke? Come on, Nina. I thought that maybe you and I... You know... No, get out of my room. Your teddy bear will miss you. Wait, how did you know? Get out. Ugh. I'm sorry. I'm such an idiot. That favor you asked me to do... Give it to Lara. Why don't you give it to her? There's nothing more compelling than a brother's gift. Oh, my God. You are gorgeous. What the hell? Where's Jessica? [MUSIC PLAYING] If you touch me again, Luke, I'll fucking kill you. I really will. I mean it. My bad. I mean, I was drunk and you were drunk and you're giving me the stare. So I took my shot. You know, your sister put so much work into this project. And we're all here to support her. Come on. Drink up, girl. Luke, what are you doing? You're like 12 years old. Come on. No one's going to notice. OK. Hey, guys. Thanks for coming with me all this way. Cheers. Cheers. Hello. How is everybody doing tonight? Are you guys enjoying the hospitality of my town? I don't know about you guys, but I'm going to have a real good time tonight. Yes. Hey, you know, Luke had his first encounter with a ghost last night. Ghost? Oh, my God. Really? Oh, that's good. He's the lucky one. I got lucky all right. I mean, that house is like really haunted. So I mean, you can put that down on your list and everything. Oh, [LAUGHS] Redbeard's house of horrors? I already do. What about you, Harvey? I guess I saw people making out with ghosts. What? Just messing with you. Drink up. Come on, Harvey. He's only 20. Nothing wrong with a drink. Leave my boy alone. Nita, I'm really sorry. OK, let's just forget about it. Did you really see a ghost? Yeah. Yeah, really saw one. And it was so real. Thanks for your support, David. I really appreciate it. This is my first big story. You should go bit with this... The Virgin of the Talako and shit. It was horrible, what the Pirates and settlers did here. There's something more. Talako was deeply loved by his people and by... Should I be jealous? No. You get extra points for listening to me go on and on about him. It's from Jessica. What is it? I don't know. Thank her when you see her. Oh, I will. What the hell is that? What happened, Luke? You saw your reflection? [LAUGHTER] Oh, my God. Did you... did you hear that? What was that? I heard many, many people died here, probably. Including the merciless Redbeard. And Talako was burned alive in these woods. Isn't that why we're staying here, Lara? Yes. Many natives and slave were tortured in this town. He didn't even bury their loved ones. Without the proper ceremony, the feast of the dead, [INAUDIBLE] can never rest and neither could their animals. Is anyone there? Anyone? Talako? Babe? I was looking for you. What's out there? No one. Will you stop, Luke? What the hell? What's wrong with you? Are you like crazy or something? Fuck. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [LAUGHS] I don't know. I just... I'm happy that we could all be together and hang out and be off our phones. Whatever. Leave me alone. Cheers. Lucy! Lucy are you OK? What's wrong? What's wrong? [PANTS] What happened? I just felt like this cold hand over my mouth. It was suffocating me. I am nothing more than a position to Redbeard, a privateers bathing. He will never let me go just as he will never relinquish his grip on the land he has stolen. He is striving to own all he sees, control all he touches. I was a fool not really that easy bargains are never to be trusted. Even in death, I fear he will never release my soul, and I shall return for more torment. [GASPS] What do you want? I'm not afraid of you. I want to help. Lara? Lara. Baby, hey. Wake up. Lara, wake up. Come on. What's wrong? I just saw a woman right there. I swear I did. Look what you're doing to yourself. Is your precious Talako worth all of this? What if Talako and other restless souls are actually trying to communicate with us? Communicate what? Get the hell out? Maybe... maybe they are warning us. I don't know. Luke... Luke needs to grow up. The shoulders like the motion... No, no, no, [INAUDIBLE] no, get some spin on it, you know what I'm saying? Hey man, you just got to drop the shoulder, show 'em a little something. Oh, [INAUDIBLE] I'm sorry. Reflex, reflex. Sorry. Come and get it. You see it? [INAUDIBLE] Nita! Nita, Nita! Let him go! The hell is wrong with you? I'm so sorry. It's not your fault. Let's get inside. Wait, who are you? I'm here to check on Lara. Come on, let's go. Lara. Thank you for being here. You can thank David for calling me. He makes me feel safe. It's good to see you with your friends. You insist that I should bring them. They're necessary. [LAUGHS] Being here feels like a dream. Even the smell of this place is so familiar. Maybe you have been here, just don't remember it. No, I've only known this place from the books I read about Talako. The ones you turned me on to. You've been so helpful with the meds and this place and... All part of the service. Seems like you're settled in. And now I know so much more. Where did you get this? From the caretaker. This house doesn't have a caretaker. What? If she's not the caretaker, who is she? Holy shit. I knew there was something off about her. Hot and weird. Woman! Drink this! [LAUGHS] He killed them, Dr. Roberts. He killed everyone. Redbeard killed even his wife. I don't know about you guys, but this Black guy is not dying first. Who wrote that diary? Lara. Her name was Lara. To me. No! [PANTS] No, no! The fuck is going on? OK. OK, guys, we need to figure out what's going on in this house. There was some stuff happening and I myself experienced it. So... Dude, Sofia warned us. There's some crazy ghosts all over this town. I invited her over for drinks, but... Wait, what? No more visitors. You remember the drawings, Lara. The natives. Yes, were my friends back then. Why are they trying to hurt us now? Sometimes we're destined to repeat our past or at least see it through the eyes of others. So he said that when I saw my dad as Redbeard, it was projecting? How did I even know how he looked like? This house has the answers. We just have to find the key. But there's no mention... Wait. What if there's not an actual key? [GASPS] I got it. I get my secrets locked away where the ashes writes. [INTERPOSING VOICES] There's a fireplace in my room. Hello? Hey, Luke? It's me, Sophia. Hey, Luke. Is that you? Luke? Hello? Is there anyone there? Luke? Harvey, is that you? Hello? [SCREAMS] [SOBS] Oh, no. Oh, no. Help me! Help me! Help me! [COUGHS] You're supposed to be guardians of this land. Who are you guarding against? Holy shit. Nita, what are you doing? Stop her! Nita! Nita, not like this. What the fuck! No! Nita! Nita! Nita. Harvey. Harvey, what are you doing? Harvey, stop! Guys, we got to go. Lara, are you OK? David, what's going on? Guys, is this some sort of joke? What's going on? Holy shit! Lara, what's wrong with you? [SCREAMS] Bring him back, Lara. You have the key. Release him now or her friends will suffer in every lifetime for all eternity. [SCREAMS] Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! No, stop, stop, stop. [SCREAMS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [CALMING MUSIC] Lara? [PHONE RINGS] He was in an accident. Mom? That's what the police said. He was drinking and driving. Come home as soon as you can. [SOBS] David, call the police, please. Let them know what happened. Do it! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Is he in pain? He's in an induced coma now. Darling, but that spares him from any pain. Oh, dad. I'm so sorry for being so angry at you all this time. Sorry for hurting you and for hurting mom too. But now all is right. I know that everything happens for a reason. Now you're free. [GASPS] I have read many books and articles about the Legend of the Talako and many studies about reincarnation. And I've found that we are not alone. There's plenty of evidence out there. Spirits don't die, they leave. And reincarnating is a learning experience to all of us. I'd like to thank you all for coming in today. And I really hope you enjoy reading the book. [APPLAUSE] Um, I have a question. What kind of objective evidence do you have? The answer is in the book. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING]
