GUYS! Screenplay: Iskra Babiè and Valentin Mihajlov Director: ISKRA BABIÈ In the lead roles Father - Petar Glebov Mother - Vera Alhovska Pavel - Alexander Mikhailov Polina - Irina Ivanova Stjopa - Mihail Buziljev-Kreco Pavlik - Petar Krilov Belka, hello! What's the matter with you, Belka? Doesn't he recognize me ??? Belka died a long time ago, son. -Dad! You're alive! Hello. Hi, Dad. Here are your dry socks. Come to the living room. Late ??. I was expecting you for lunch. It's a long way, Dad. I was late for the train in Murmansk. So what ?? from the station to here ... And where is the mother? - I sent it to your sister Valentina. Because? - Not to interfere with our male conversations. I see, diplomacy in full light. - What did you think? It has accumulated over the years. Here is my village, here is my birthplace! - That's right. Come, sit at the table. - Wait, Dad. So. Please be nice. And this is for the cut. It ?? didn't she gain weight? And this is for the mother. Fur. And this is for you, Dad. Specialists say - a cure for everything. Thanks. Will it ?? To the women of that pill, they rely on it. And I'm healthy for now. You scared me with a telegram, Dad. - If I hadn't scared you, I wouldn't have come. Worth ?? me, father. What was, was. It has fallen into oblivion. It was, but it didn't work out. Sit down to make a toast to your coming. Come on. Still this is a big day, I see my son again. But tell me how you live. Why didn't you bring your Tamara? Did you get married? It's not a paper thing. We wanted to come together, they wouldn't let her. Yes, I brought a photo. And why didn't they let her go? Is it irreplaceable? No, he is responsible for a lot of money and valuables. He heads the jewelry department. Nice work. Listen, you probably forgot what day it was. And look ??, I remember. Exactly 12 years ago ... mother and I were waiting for you at home to come back ?? from the Navy. And instead they brought us that letter. Evo. Shall I read to you in what words you renounced us? Stop it, Dad. He knows ?? which is why I didn't come back. You guessed it. Natoèi jo ?? po èa ?? icu. Let's remember Nastion, good soul. It's been half a year since we buried her. She was a good woman, full of respect. She picked up the girl, completely like herself. She gave her the name Polinka, as they call our mother. And you will ??, freaks, jo ?? let go of a tear as he remembers it ?? with a glass. Listen, Dad. This is a futile conversation. I did not forgive her and I will never forgive her. And I, my dear, don't care about your forgiveness. Nastjona was ours, she spent her whole miserable life in dreams. We buried her there , her earth is light. And I wouldn't go into those, as you say, futile conversations. I have a duty and I will do it. Shortly before she died, she called me, and confided her last wish to me. She told me to tell you not to be mad at you and that she remembered and loved you, a fool, all her life . Thanks, Dad, thanks. Ba ?? you cheered me up. You say she loved me, remembered? But me, Dad, the tears don't touch me. She turned my whole life upside down, so to speak . After her, I don't trust any woman. She took away my hometown. I 've been wandering the tundra for so many years. It is not okay to run away from your own child on the tundra. ?? to? -Eto to! Because Polina is our only granddaughter, and to you, Pavle Matvejic, a daughter has been born! Listen, Dad ... So, huh? So, Dad? He doesn't know about you ?? who cares. Take it easy, kid! Those were her words on her deathbed, if you can comprehend it. And if necessary ?? evidence as if you were a prosecutor, tell me now ... Did you get a letter in the army that your fiancé's belly was growing? Are you?! Yes I am. Are! So, the mother does not suffer in vain, she prays for the forgiveness of sins. But it's not that her mother recklessly slandered her, but in what you, because of your foolishness , believed. You are responsible! That's why , Pa ?? a, that's why I invited you here. That knot needs to be untied. Whether Polina is your daughter or not, let your conscience tell you. The question is whether he will be an orphan next to his living father when I die. We need to address this issue as human beings. Listen, Dad. I understand you. Now you understand me too. I am in that situation either a bastard or a fool. Bastard if I ran away from my own child, and a fool if I accept someone else's little one as my own. What choice, huh? No, Dad. I am a man of experience. I spit on women's fairy tales. Like this! And that's what Nastjona did to you ... Well, it's not just Polinka, it's rumored that they were still there ?? two kids! Maybe they are mine too! Maybe I should admit them too! But that would be ridiculous! Daddy would ba ?? naslaðivale! It's just, Dad, I'm not used to being a fool. And let's change that board once and for all! Okay, I said mine, you answered! Almost! -That's it! - When you lie down, turn off the light. - I'll turn it off. Rex, get away! Here are your guests, Polina. -Good afternoon. The city commission wants to see how you live. - We're fine. Better than everyone? - Not worse than the others. Potatoes gave birth, vegetables too. It will be enough for the winter. She has a dairy cow, she's good. Roman Gavrilovic promised hay. - Yes, we'll separate the part. There is a solution. - Comrades, comrades, what is it about? Cow, hay, potatoes. Let's talk seriously. And not outside. Yes, Polina. Enter the house. So if it is urgent and there is such a law, grant custody to us. Who is it for you? - To me, Matvey Jegorovic Zubov and my wife. We have submitted our application to you. - My God. I just read you an article of the law. What's it like? A respectable and respected person can be appointed as a guardian ... So here it is. You will find no better than my own brother . -Toèno. Wait. Materially secured ... - It won't be missed. And not older than 60 years. God forbid that happens to you. Will the children be orphaned again? Oprostite, Matveju Jegorovièu. If we can't stay home, then don't separate us. That is my condition. The condition? No conditions, girl. There are strict rules. ?? will live ?? in our boarding school and attend our school . We will send Pavlik to the orphanage , and ... And your Stjopko needs to be examined by a doctor so we'll send him to a special home. For children with special needs. No need for an examination. Mom took Stjopka to the doctor. He said everything was fine with him. This is how it can be with small children: You hear, you hear, and then suddenly they speak. -Najednom? Nothing happens all at once. To speak, he needs to be dealt with. I deal. Pavlik already reads and Stjopa knows all the letters, just them ?? he can't pronounce. Po-sa-di-o grandfather re-pi-cu. Na-ra-sla re-pi-ca ve-li-ka, pre-ve-li-ka. Grandfather stopped the rape from pulling the earth. He pulls, pulls, he can't get her out. Grandpa called grandpa, then grandpa grandpa, a djed re-pu vu-èe ... Eizmice, eizmice stay nepotumplane. Eizmice, eizmice stay nepotumplane. Oh you, Kolya, Kolya, Nikolai, sit at home, don't fool around. At the end of the village do not go, the leaking ring does not offer. Eizmice, eizmice stay nepotumplane. Izmice, èizmice ... Judge the people, judge God, how I loved, I visited my dear barefoot in the frost . Izmice, èizmice ... Eismatic state nepotumplane. Eizmice, eizmice stay nepo ... If we don't stay together, we're not going anywhere . This is our last. Let's end this, comrades. September is coming to an end, girl still ?? doesn't go to school. Because you're procrastinating with the decision, the children lost their pensions after the death of the foster mother. After all, I 'm embarrassed about you, too. No, no and no. Prepare the children. They must be ready in a week. All the best. Stop, stop! Drop me to town. Someone is like ?? uri. Should we miss it? - It'll work out somehow. Mom! -Pavlik! Son! - What's the matter with you, mother? How did you leave without saying goodbye? - I didn't want to leave. What's the matter with you, Mom? I just went to get a ticket. Well, I don't have things. Zaharovna, I told you. Where would you go? Hello, fugitive. -Hello, bro. My dear son. I'm sorry, Sergei Ivanovich, I didn't recognize you. - Anything I could tell you. Wait, maybe I'll tell you. You're in a hurry, drive! -Pas? Anjka. You know, I sent you a telegram. Call. -Is it? I didn't get it. Of course, you missed it. I have two events. To my son, that's the first. I'm sending him to the army, that's another thing. -Don't you come? to? -Because? Marry him or see him off? -Eh, brother, nobody asks us anything. We are expecting you tonight, be punctual! -Deal! When you went to the army, still? has blossomed more. She went to dance at the club. That painter from the city rushed to paint her portrait. ?? to ima ?? to paint someone else's fiancée? I was angry. And babe, she knows ?? and alone, just sniffing. Is that OK? She came to me once to ask me for a letter, what, and I see, Lord, that she is already pregnant. Believes ?? Li, Pa ?? enjka, my heart tightened. I embarrassed her. But did I want evil? I had no idea what happened between you and Nastja. I kept you from embarrassment. So I wrote that damn letter. I bear a great sin in my soul, son, I know, but so is the punishment. My conscience bothers me. The poor girl is always before my eyes, and your father has become like a stone. He hasn't looked me in the eye since winter. He gritted his teeth at every word. He sharply told me, "You slandered her, there is no mercy for you." Now it can be seen that Polju? Ka is our blood. In the face is the same Nastja, and when she gets up, when she sits down, she's the same , she picked everything up from you. Enough, mother. Cut it out. to sad? Oh, Pa? Enjka, punish me, but not to death. Calm down. Lie down. Lie down. -Oh, if I could get everything back to square one! Today is our day. Today is our day. White day, white day, white day, white day. And who is our cavalier? And who is our cavalier? Kavalir, kavalir. Kavalir, kavalir. Yes, Yuri is our cavalier, Sergeyevich is our cavalier. Kavalir, kavalir... Dear relatives and guests! We've heard a lot of nice words and wishes here, as well as a toast to the bride and groom, for fathers and mothers. Thank you. But a wedding like a wedding, and tomorrow-the day after tomorrow the groom will go to the military department. His head is ready for his hat. Here is what I want to say, dear relatives and guests ... I would like to wish my son Jurka, tomorrow's sailor or soldier, wherever he served, in the south or north, in the infantry or in the navy, I would like to have a friend like the one I had in all my years of service on the rocky shores of the Barents Sea. And even though I'm four years older than him, he was like a leader to me, a brave sailor. Here he is, Pavel Matvejevic Zubov, dear guest! Cheers, Paul. Friend, say a word to the young soldier. What can I say? I will say the most important thing. You, Jurka, serve cheerfully. And you, Njura ... Wait for her husband and be honest. Anyway , good luck! -Good luck! Good luck! Good luck! -Good luck! My God, it looks like two drops. What's the matter with you? You had to see each other once . Smile, Pavlik! Hear ?? you? What was, was, and what will be, will be. Come on. For your happiness. Serjo ?? a, pour it for him. Well? Come on. -Cheers! Snack. Golden bees, why are you buzzing ??? Golden bees, why are you buzzing ??? ?? ao, ?? ao, ?? ao mi ?? to zuji ??. ?? ao, ?? ao, ?? ao mi ?? to zuji ??. It flies around, but it doesn't fly away ... It flies around ... Fields! Why did you leave the wedding? - The boys are home alone. And I take the cow to the herd. Is it hard for you alone? It's not. The brothers have no relatives? Pavlik has a father, but he is completely drunk. Mom felt sorry for him, and then we left. If the father is a drunkard, it is better without him. And Stjopa was abandoned, they left him at home. Mom breastfed him and Pavlik, so he stayed with us. He is good, he understands everything, just keep quiet. How did you live? -Good. Mom first worked in the city as a painter. We lived in a home. Everyone there caressed me. And later in the club with Petar Leonidovic. He had a room. And when there were four of us, we returned to the village. Grandpa Matthew fixed the roof and that's how we lived. And he knows ?? do you know anything about me? - I know everything . We also have your photo. What? - In a sailor uniform. - Grandpa Matthew talked about you. And Grandma Fields and Mom. - Mom cursed at me? - What's the matter with you? She said you were a good man, but conceited. I'm going. Fields. Well ?? ENCS. I'm making pie for tomorrow. Is the wedding over? - It's not, it's at its peak. - What about you? I'm gone. - Let it be, good. But Dad, what did they decide about the kids? That's none of your business. - How come it's not? Listen, Paul, I told you yesterday and you answered me. Be a man! What has been said, has been said, what has been done, has been done! He is not angry with his father, Pa ?? a, they do not give him children, that is why he is angry. How come they don't give it to him? - They say he's old. What if he dies? They say the law is like that. Wait, mother. Do you take all three of them? And how will ?? separate them, Pa ?? enjka? Well, they are ours, closer than relatives. So, Dad? He doesn't care about the law either! No, and we have settled everything with the law. He went to Valentina's hospital. She agrees. She will be given custody, and we will live as before. That's what it means. It was decided and signed. And did you ask me? And who are you to ask? - How am I? Va ?? son, among other things! And Polina's own father! Son you are, that's right, we don't deny it! And you're supposed to be a family member! But you are no father! -Matju ?? a! -Pst, Polina! The man is over 30 years old, and you are still defending him ??! You defended him. Here he is, sitting down, a real egoist! -Listen, Dad, choose your words! I choose them! I have been choosing them for 13 years! And while I'm alive, my granddaughter won't be home! He has relatives, grandparents, aunts, he will embrace her! Listen, you've scolded me a lot, Dad. Think for yourself. How will ?? Valentini load such an obligation? He has a sick heart! He is disabled, so to speak! -Invalid? You are disabled yourself! Your soul froze in the north! Come on, your sister is disabled. That! And I will die soon! What about that? What do you suggest ??? ?? to? ?? to? ?? to? Maybe I would take Polina with me! - Maybe you would, and maybe you wouldn't! And maybe no one will believe you? Maybe no one will trust you? How can he not trust? - Well, because "maybe" there's no hope! You're weak! Dad! -Pa ?? a, Pa ?? enjka dear! - If you weren't my father ... Mathieu ?? a! -Pst, Polina! Don't interfere! Fields! Fields! Fields! Fields! Polinjka! Open up! It's important. Fields, he knows? that I am your father? I know. How does he know ??? From mom, from grandpa. What are we going to do with you? Ha? I do not know. - Then I know! Get ready, let's go! Where? -How to where? We're going north. We will live together. That's enough, you're exhausted. ?? to stoji ?? like dead? Shall we? -Not. -How not? I can't be with you. - How can you not ??? So that's how it is. Not? So no? And I thought he would ?? to rejoice. But what now, if he says ?? no. So that's it? All right, go home. Go. Go to sleep.

If there are any problems, I am in the workshop all day. Ministry of Education of the Leninsky district of Stavropol. Look, look ... The girl is lucky. Nobody needed her before, and now we have the request of Matvey Jegorovich Zubov. He refuses because of his age. There is also a request from Valentina Matvejevna Zubova. And he will be rejected because it is known how sick she is. And now you, stranger, newcomer. And by what right? - I'm a father. Father? -That. You called late, Dad.

Who is the fur coat for, Pavle Matvejevic, if it is not a secret? It's a secret. - Are you mincing? - That's how we poets are. And why don't you ask about Tamara Semyonovna? And what would I ask? The whole town knows she deserted. Yes, don't you want to read her letter? - He even has a letter? For those who do something. - We're just singing, let the others dance.

Better me than uninvited guests! Hello! Meet. Polina Pavlovna Zubova. ?? amraj Lav. Meet. -Thank you. Asanov Arslan. Call me Uncle Gri ?? a. There's a fish, where am I going with it? Let's meet.

The sea stretched wide and raged in the distance, buddy , we're traveling far, we're still in a foreign land. Dude , we're traveling far, we're still in a foreign land. "Comrade, I have no strength to endure the shift," said the badger to the badger, the fires in the furnaces do not burn at all, there is no more steam in the boilers. You are, Pa ?? a, an adventurer, looking for ?? adventures. Why is he talking like that ??? It's all right, all the best. You're done and done. Done work? And what job did he do? Dear brother, work yet ?? he didn't even start. And what awaits you, Pasha, only I can tell you. Don't do that, Grisha. This month has not been easy for me either. And the devil will know, maybe I need this more than they do. I'm selfish, understand ??? Let's make a toast to the egoist. I'm sorry, Pasha, but as far as life experience is concerned, you're just a nuisance to me. Ask me what it means to raise children. Your own children, watch out, not someone else's.

Yes, together. - As much as possible. For a start, I didn't understand what happened to Stepan. Is he deaf and dumb? No, guys, what's the matter with him , he's fine. He hears, understands normally. If only I did. Look what the doctors wrote. Gle, Pa ?? a. To se na ?? i tuku? Damn! Guys! Guys! Did they bite you? Where? Where does it hurt? Pa ?? a, izaði! Are you OK? Stop! What did you say!

Bravo! -Bravo. Did you see? Only Polinka believed she would speak for sure. Say, Fields! to? What's the matter with you? Did they bite you? Fields, what is it? Did they bite you? North accepted you! Well done, Stjopka! Look who's going! Pa ?? ka Zubov! -Hello, guys! -Worthy of Paul! Family striker. - Hi, guys. Listen, manager, it's rumored that you gave birth to three in a month. Not three, but four. One is all in fur. Well, is everything okay with kindergarten? -Thank you. How do some people get everything? Guys, it's time. Let's go. -To go.
