Eight, eight, three, one. Eight, eight, three, one. Okay. Eight, eight, three, one. Come on. Eight, eight, three, one. Motherfuck. Okay. Go away. Eight, three, three, one. Okay. Eight, three, three, one. Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. Oh. Come on. Hi, you've reached Bonnie Zane with Greater Wayne Property Management. I can't come to the phone right now. Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me. ...but please leave a message, and I'll call you right back. Hi. This is Tess Marshall. I'm in town. I'm at the house on Barbary. And I'm on the porch, and it's pouring rain, and there is no key in the lockbox. So, please, could you just call me back on this number? Thank you. God damn it. Yeah? I'm sorry, who are you? What? Who are you? This is 476 Barbary, right? Yeah, no. Yeah, yeah. I think so. You don't know? No. I don't live here. I'm renting this place. It's the middle of the night. I don't have it in the top of my head, the address. No, I'm renting this place. What? I... I'm renting this place. I... I booked it on Airbnb like a month ago. I booked it on HomeAway. You're fucking kidding. Wait, wait. Wait, are you sure you have the right place? Yeah, I... Yeah, my email says 476 Barbary. That's here, right? And my code works for the lockbox. I'm supposed to be in here. Did you try and call someone? Yeah. No one answered. And you're sure you have the right date? Look. Yeah. I mean, it looks right. Fuck. This is unbelievable. What am I supposed to do? I don't know. I don't know. Why don't you... Why don't you come inside? And we'll call these idiots. Uh, would you mind if I... Yeah? I need to use the bathroom. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. It's just down the hall, to your left. Okay. I'll be right back. Would you mind pulling up your reservation confirmation, just so I can see it? In case I'm some kinda weirdo, who's broken in here to sleep? Yeah, yeah. No, it's fine. Let me just find my phone. Here. Jesus. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were back. I was just getting my phone. Sorry. Here's... Here's the thing. Right. Yep. That looks right to me. Great. Maybe I have a different number through HomeAway than the one that you called? This is what I got. 303-5... 5... 303-509... Yeah, that... That's the same one. Yeah. Listen, I don't know what the protocol is for this. Me neither. Um... I guess I'll just find somewhere else. I mean... Yep. Guess I'm gonna do that. Uh, I'll let you get back to sleep. I feel bad. It's clearly not your fault. What are you gonna do? Just go drive around, looking for a hotel? I have my phone. Make some calls. In your car? Yeah, I don't think that's such a good idea. I mean, I don't know if you got a great look at this neighborhood, but it's not... I don't think you should be sitting out there by yourself this late. I mean, I wouldn't do that. Look, obviously, do whatever you want, but if you wanna hang out in here, where it's dry, and there's a lock on the door, I'm totally fine with that. Uh, here's the Wi-Fi info... Thanks. ...if you need it. Oh, by the way, I'm Keith. Tess. Tess. That's a pretty name. Thanks. Do you want anything? I think there's some tea in the kitchen. Um... Want some tea? I'm okay. Thank you. Okay. Um... Oh, shit, yeah. There's... Somebody left out a bottle of wine here. With a ribbon on it, like a housewarming thing. And there's some nuts here, too. I'm just saying. I'm okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. Um, I'm gonna have some tea. I'll just make you a cup. Hi. Hi, I was just wondering, do you have any rooms available? Yeah. For tonight, that's right. Really? Okay, thanks. Uh... Shit. You know what I just realized? The water is heating up, by the way. You know what I just realized? What's that? There's a convention in town. What? Yeah, there's, like, some huge medical thing. I don't think you're gonna be able to get a room tonight. I can't believe this. All right. Here's what I propose. Why don't you just crash here? Oh, no. I don't... I don't think that's... No, no, no. You take the bedroom, and I'll sleep out here on the couch. And then tomorrow, we'll call these idiots. Get our money back. Free stay for both of us. Really can't believe this. I mean, I don't know what else there is to do. I can take the couch. No, no, no. Call me what you want, but there's no way I'm sleeping in the bedroom while a young lady is sleeping on the couch. Blame it on my upbringing, but it's not up for discussion. Well, no offense, but I kinda have a thing about clean sheets. You really didn't have to do that. Not even up for discussion. Besides, I have a raincoat and you don't. No, no, I got it. Oh. No, no, no. You sure? You sure? I can... Yeah. Okay. You left this in the bedroom. Oh, shit. Thanks. Good eyes. I'm gonna go wash up. Yeah. Knock yourself out. Uh, hey. Uh, the laundry's still in the wash. Um... But I thought, well, I'm wide awake, so... So I, um... It's gonna be a bit now. I thought I'm gonna have some of this here wine. But I didn't wanna open it before you got out of the shower because I noticed you didn't drink your tea. And, well, I totally get that, by the way. I mean, you don't know me, and this is a fucking really weird situation. It makes total sense. Um, but I thought that you might want some of this. But if I opened it while you weren't here, that... that... Fuck, I'm sorry. I'm rambling. Jesus Christ. Um... I thought you wouldn't want any if you didn't see me open it. So, I waited. I'm good, but you go ahead. You sure? Yeah. Okay. Um... Um, it's... I'd say you have about an hour and change till the bedding's done. You gonna make it? I looked around for some clean ones, but I couldn't find any. What are you gonna do on the couch? Oh, I'll be fine. Yeah. I've slept on worse. I'm really sorry about all this. What, are you kidding? It's not your fault. You're just as put out as me. Do you want me to make you another cup of tea? No. You can watch this time. I'm okay. So, um... What brings you to town? Job interview. Oh, yeah? Is it tomorrow? Yeah. What's the job about, if you don't mind me asking? Yeah. It's okay. Um, it's a research position for a documentary filmmaker. Really? Who's the filmmaker? Her name is Catherine James. Catherine James? I don't know her. Has she done anything I'd seen? Uh, she made a movie about jazz last year, called Blue Easy. Oh, I saw that. You saw Blue Easy? I thought it was great. Are you kidding? No one's seen that movie. About the makeshift brass band? And there's that scene with the kids on the rooftop, playing the Coltrane stuff? Yeah, it's great. I can't believe you saw that. I thought it was awesome. What's her new film gonna be about? Oh, it's gonna be about this place. Detroit. Like Detroit music? Oh, well, it's gonna be about the artists that have come here in the last ten years and set up collectives and creative communities on the... Well, the edge of... Where the houses are basically free. That's pretty cool. Do you know who you should interview for that? Who? Me. Why is that? Because I'm actually one of the founders of the Lion Tamers. You're kidding. No. I mean, I'm not, like, the guy, but I'm one of the guys, yeah. That's insane. It is insane. What are you doing in an Airbnb? Don't you guys, like, have a whole block or something? No, yeah. No, we do. But we're looking for a new space. So, I'm here for a week, basically just scouring this side of town. Looking for our next little nest. Oh, my God. It's not a cliche I've heard before. Oh, come on. It's such a cliche. The guy who thinks love and control are the same thing. And the girl who lets herself become, I don't know, some kind of pet or something? Oh, my God. It's so cliche and it's so boring, and I can't believe it's happening to me. Is it still happening? I mean, look at you. You already got your new job lined up. Mmm. Job interview. I don't have the job yet. I'm not home free. Look. There's always gonna be people that project some kind of dynamic onto us that serves them. It's up to us if we wanna play ball or not. Is that my lesson? I don't know. I don't know. I just need to stop going back. I keep going back. Maybe that's it. Or maybe my lesson is that guys will walk all over you as long as you let them. Yeah. That's my lesson. I take issue with that statement. Oh, yeah. That's 'cause you're a guy. I mean, the world's different for you. Guys get to blast their way through life making messes. Girls have to be careful. Elaborate. Okay. Take tonight. If I had been the one that checked in first and you showed up late at night... What, you wouldn't have let me in? Hell no. I wouldn't have let you in. Do you think I'm crazy? But if I was dumb enough to let you in, you wouldn't even think twice. You would just march on in. Hey, you just marched on in. Yeah, because I had to. And it was scary. What, do I look like some kind of monster? Not my point. I get it. I get it. I mean... There's a lot of bad dudes out there. And it sucks. Look, are you gonna stay locked into some fucked-up toxic dynamic that somebody else picked for you? Or are you gonna move on? Maybe find someone else. Even if that means that you may get your heart ripped outta your chest all over again. Hmm. Why is it always the girls who get their hearts ripped out in these things? Girls can rip. Trust me. Okay, so now that it's inside out... Right. Right? That's the first step. Yeah? Then, now you kind of go deep. No. You dive in. Now, this... Trust me. This is the best way to do it. No, you're fucking with me. This is not how you do it. - This is how you do it. - This is the best way. It never bunches up. It gets completely smooth. You'll thank me later when you're lying under a perfectly even duvet, here. So, if, but... Looks so dumb. So, here... Right? Here is where I kinda need your help a little bit. Now that you're here... Oh, my God. ...you have to be my assistant. Right. If you wouldn't mind, grabbing the duvet... Okay. ...and you kinda give me the two edges where my edges are... Yeah, sure. ...where the two meet. All right, thank you. Okay. You got it? Thank you very much. So, back up 'cause now it gets a little bit... A little... My God. A little aggressive with the thing. Oh, my God. But that is how you get the duvet in. So graceful. That's how you do it. Are you usually this outta breath afterwards? The final... Grab that edge there, please. Mmm-hmm. Okay, and... Yeah, yeah. Wow. Okay. Well, you are officially situated. Yeah. I think that about does it. Yeah. Okay, thank you for tonight. Sorry for keeping you up before the big day. Oh, no. It was fun. I... I liked it. Yeah. Me, too. Okay, there's a couch that needs to be... Yeah. Yeah. Put in gear here, so... I'm so sorry. Oh, don't be. Don't be. I can sleep on anything. Good night, Tess. Good night, Keith. Keith? Keith? Help me. No. No. Keith? The fuck! Oh, I'm so sorry. What are you doing? Uh, I... Um... My door was open. And I didn't open it, and I... You... And I didn't know if you were up, and you were, like, making noises and... I was making noise? I'm so... I'm so sorry. I'm just gonna... I'm gonna let you go to sleep. You scared the shit out of me. Did you open my door? No! Yeah. Oh, God. Shit. Keith? Tess? Oh. Hi, Catherine! Hi! So nice to meet you! Nice to meet you, too. Thanks for making the trip all the way out here. Yeah. So, where are you staying while you're in town? Oh, an Airbnb. Oh, that's nice. Whereabouts? Uh, it's in Brightmoor. You know where that is? What? Yeah. You know it? Are you kidding? Well, I mean... It seems a little rough, but... No, you shouldn't be there. What do you mean? That's not... An Airbnb in Brightmoor? Yeah, I mean, like... It's a cute little house, but... Yeah, I suppose the neighborhood is a little... Tess. Well, I did try and find somewhere else, but there's, like, a convention in town or something? And I have a roommate, so... It's a little complicated. I guess. Okay, well, just be careful, okay? Seriously. I will. I'm... I'm tough. Good. Well... It was really nice to meet you. Yeah! No, I'm excited. I'm gonna call you tomorrow, okay? This is gonna be great. Hey! Hey, little girl! Hey! Come here! Hey, little girl! Come out that house! Go away! Come out that house! Yes! I don't know what... I can't see him anymore. He left? I don't know! Can you just send someone, please? We don't have any available units at the moment. What? So nobody's coming? Ma'am, calm down. As I said, we don't have any available units at this... Shit. Fuck. Nope. Keith! Keith! Keith! What the fuck! I'm... I'm stuck down here. Uh, do you have the key? It's here, but I can't open this! All right. Right here. Okay, you pull and I push. Okay. One, two, three. Okay. Are you okay? We need to go now! What are you talking about? Why were you in the basement? I got locked in the basement, and then there was this hidden area! There was this room! There's a hidden room? There is something bad going on here! Tess! Tess! Relax! Relax. You're okay, you're safe. You're safe, all right? You're safe. Okay. I don't... I don't think I am. What's down there? What did you see? Okay... I was in the basement. And then I found this hidden passageway. And there was this room, and it was like a... Like a dungeon. Like a dungeon? What was in there? There was a bed... Okay. ...and a camera, and a bucket. All right. Uh, so, there's a bed and a... What, a bucket and a camera? Yeah. I'm just gonna go look. No, no, no, please don't! There was, like, a handprint on the wall. Tess, calm down, calm down. You're not making any sense, okay? So, there's a room downstairs with a bed and a bucket in it? It's a basement. It's filled with junk, okay? It doesn't sound that weird. If you wanna go and look, suit yourself but I'm going! Right now? Yes. All right, Tess, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop! Just stop, stop! Move! Just stop! Can you give me a moment, please? Can you just give me a moment? Twenty seconds? Okay, I'm sorry if I don't seem like I'm taking whatever it is that you saw seriously. I just... I didn't see it. Okay? And I can't just be running off in a panic because there's a room downstairs with a bed and a bucket! Tess? No, Tess! Tess, wait, I'm sorry! I just... I just want to see it. You don't even have to come with me if you don't want to. I'm not going back down there. That's fine. That's fine. Can you just... Can you just wait up here in case I get locked inside, too? Can you? I'll wait. Just 30 seconds, okay? Just wait here. Do you see it? Yeah. Okay, well, come back up now. Keith? Keith? Keith! Keith? Keith? Keith? Tess! Keith! Help! Come up here, Keith! Help me! Please! Please! Keith! Hey! Keith! Answer me, Keith! Tess... Keith! Keith! Keith! Why did you come down here? Someone else is down here. No, why? Why did you come down here? There's someone... Someone else is down here. What? Someone bit me. Okay. Okay. We need to go. We need to get out of here! No, don't go near there. That's where they were! No, that's the way out! Come back this way. No, please, stop it! Come this way! Stop it! We have to come this way! Let go off me! We have to come this way! That's the way out! Someone's down... Please stop! I'm not going back there!

Hey, AJ. I have David Stern and Melissa Herberts for you. Love it. Guys, you're on with AJ. - Yo, what's up? - Hi, AJ. Hey, AJ. Uh, we need to discuss something that's just come through. Cool. What's up? So this is a bit of an awkward conversation, but there's been a troubling development. Okay, what? Apparently, Megan Maddox has contacted the network through her lawyer and she's made a very serious accusation against you. Really? What'd she say? She's claimed that you were sexually aggressive during the filming of the pilot, and she no longer wants to move forward if you're involved. She... What? The network is taking this very seriously. What does that mean? That means that at this time, they're gonna start an investigation. Wait, wait, wait. What about the pilot? Hold on. Wait a minute. This is crazy. So, are we not picked up anymore? Well, like I said, they're going to conduct an investigation, and then decide how to proceed. An investigation? AJ, I think, honestly, the most likely outcome of all of this is that even if the show does go forward... Yeah? ...it's very unlikely that you will be involved. No. I'm fired? I think, essentially, that's the most likely outcome. That fuckin' bitch. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Wait a minute, you guys. Wait, wait, wait. This is totally blown out of proportion. Okay, I think it's important to say that it's not in your best interest to go into details on this call. The fuck does that mean, Melissa? Okay, AJ, I think you just need to calm down, honestly, buddy. You can just relax. This can't be real. Just like that, I'm out? Are you fucking kidding? I was the first to be attached to that! She came on after me! Okay, I... I recommended her. AJ, I think, honestly, you just need to calm down. David, I think we should tell him the other thing. No, I think right now he just needs to cool down... What other? What other? It's not important, AJ. You just have to relax. No, no, no, fuck that. What other? What else? There is gonna be a story tomorrow in the Hollywood Reporter about this. About what? About me? Are you kidding? The allegations are very serious. Yo... What's she saying I did? Is she saying I raped her or something? AJ, why don't you just calm down, okay? No. What the fuck is she saying? Yes. She's saying that you raped her. AJ, are you there? I gotta call you back. So, let's assume that the income we have for the year is what we're gonna have at year's end. No new money coming in. I think that's pretty safe to say. What do you anticipate your legal expenses to be? So, I talked it over with my lawyer, and, um, we're looking at two separate cases here. There's the defense against the charge, which is 100% not true, by the way. So, there's that, and then there's the countersuit for defamation, which I'm 100% gonna win. I'm gonna ruin this fuckin' bitch. How much? They said it's probably gonna be, like, around 70,000 each. So, 140,000. What does that do to me? Well, with your current rate of spending, that's gonna put you at zero in... Three months. Oh, fuck me. Oh, my God. You've got some small income from your Michigan properties... But it's your mortgage here that's killing you. Are you saying I have to sell my house? I'm saying you're gonna have to make some tough choices. I could sell the Michigan properties. Some of those make money, right? Yeah, but some don't. You could sell those. Buy yourself some time. But no more than a couple of months. Those aren't exactly hot properties. I can't fuckin' believe this. This is nuts. Listen, AJ, I gotta tell ya. What? At the end of this week, I'm gonna give you your files back. Cool. What's that mean? I'm going to suggest that you find alternate wealth management. Oh, my God. You're dropping me, too? Oh, fuck me. Fuck. It's AJ Gilbride for Robert. Gilbride. Thank you. Robert, hey. You see the article? Oh, it's out. Yeah, insane. Feel like I'm sittin' on the sideline, just watching this thing spiral out of control. Robert, hang on. Wait, wait, wait. I'm just gonna put you on speaker. Getting in a rental. Hold on. You hear me? I hear you. Uh, I was just saying, if I could just have, like, a conversation with her, I could probably nip this whole thing in the bud. Absolutely not. Under no circumstances are you to contact her. If I just call her and just be like... Listen to me. There's zero chance, at this point, that you calling her is gonna bring about anything but more problems for you. Do you hear me? Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Any communication goes through us from now on... Wait, I'm sorry. What do you mean you're getting into the rental? What rental? Uh, I'm in Detroit. I rented a car. You're in Detroit, Michigan? Yeah. What? AJ, you aren't supposed to leave the state. Why not? I'm not under arrest. I'm allowed to travel. This is not advisable. You really need to be here in case there are developments. "Developments?" You think they're gonna arrest me? I think that is a very distinct possibility. I think that flying off to another state is not a good look right now. Well, Robert, I don't know how to say this, but, um, unless you plan on taking me on pro bono, uh, I'm gonna have to scrape up some money. You know, I'm not here on the lam. I'm not here on vacation. I'm here to do some fucking liquidating. May I help you? Yeah, I'm an owner. I'm here to pick up a set of keys. Name? AJ Gilbride. Oh, yeah. Bonnie said you'd be coming. Um... 476 Barbary. Fuck. The fuck? Fucking shit is this? The fuck, dude? Hello? Greater Wayne Property Management. Hey. Yeah, yeah. Bonnie, it's AJ. AJ? Gilbride from... Oh, AJ. Hi. Right. Um... Is someone staying here at the moment? I don't think so. Well, someone's here. There's a suitcase, and clothes, and shit. Yeah, no. People are staying here. I don't... I mean... We haven't rented it out in a couple of weeks. Well, do we know when the last tenants checked out? Do I have squatters? This... I mean, are you saying that no one's come by to look at this place since the last tenants? Like, no maid or anything? The maids come to prep the houses before the arrival of the next tenants. No new renters, no maid service. That's nuts. What if somebody trashed the place? How... How would I know? Is the place trashed? No, Bonnie. The place isn't trashed. That's not the point. The point is it's... What kind of system is that? It's fucking idiotic. I also don't know why you're so calm. Have a nice day. So, who the fuck is staying in my house? Hello? Dude. AJ, I can't hear you. It sounds like you're in a racecar. I'm washing my face. What? I'm washing my face. Well, could you stop, please? Happy? Of course I'm not happy. I don't know what to tell people. What do you want us to say? I don't know, Mom. Just say she's a lying fuckin' bitch. Oh, don't talk... Don't talk like that. What? She is. That's not nice. "Nice," really? Ruining my career and reputation isn't "nice," either. I think I'm well within my rights to call her a "fuckin' bitch." I know, sweetie. I know you wouldn't do those things. When are you coming back home? It's only a four-hour flight to Detroit. You father and I want to see you. Really? Dad wants to see me? Did he say that? Oh, you know how he is. He's just... He's upset. Mom, I gotta go. I'm getting an important work call. Okay, baby. I love... What up, faggot? Guess who's back in town. Could we just, like, real-talk for a moment, though? Could we real-talk? Fuck, yeah, dude. Okay, like, just, what the fuck actually did happen with you guys? No, dude. I'm saying, like, you're my boy, obviously. I'm gonna believe whatever you tell me. Right, right. I gotta hear you say it. No, I know, I know. I feel you. 'Cause I read the website. I know what the fuckin' Internet says, but, like, man-to-man, real-talk, what the fuck actually happened? Dude, I'll be real with you, okay? That's all I'm asking for. Yo, yo, let me be... That's the only thing I'm asking. Let me be real with you. We fucked. We did fuck. Okay? Right. She just took some convincing, is all. That's it. Okay, but what the fuck does that mean, though? Like, I mean, was she like... Did she say no? Was she like, "No, stop?" I mean, at first. But, like, I wasn't like... "Come here, bitch. I'm gonna rape you." Right. It was like, in the beginning, she was like, "No..." Whatever. But, like... Then we started foolin' around more, and then she was down. Like fuckin' really down. Right. I'm a persistent dude, right? I'm like fuckin' Eye of the Tiger. Yeah. Right. You know? And she came around, and that's it. That's what happened, straight up. Hi, this is Megan. Please leave a message. Hi, Megan. This is AJ. Uh... I'm guessing you probably don't wanna talk to me but I, um... I just wanna say I'm really, really sorry if I did anything that night that might've like... Offended you or... 'Cause you know, people can have different versions of the same thing. And... I'm actually not even mad at you about it. And I hope you're not mad at me, 'cause I really... I really am sorry. And if you call me back, I'll apologize to you again. So... Please call me back, and I'll apologize to you again. Okay. Oh, shit. Who the fuck are you? Oh, yes. Okay. "Tess." All right. Fuck. Hello? Fuck. Somebody here? Hello? Okay, here's the deal. I have a gun. And I'm gonna come down there and just open up on whoever I see in about 30 seconds. All right? Or you can just come up here now, and I'll let you go. I'm not fuckin' around! Who's down there? Squat in my fuckin' house? Huh? Hide in my basement? I'm a fuckin' man. I'll fuck you up. Yes. Last chance! All right, bitch. Get ready to get fucked. What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. "Can underground rooms be listed as square footage "when selling home?" Uh, "as for rooms in the house that aren't finished, "like basements or attics they should not be included "in the total square footage." Fuck. "Below-grade spaces, basements, dens, etc., "do not usually count." Okay, "usually." "Even a finished basement can't be counted "toward the home's gross living area, GLA, "but it can be noted separately "in the listing's total area." Oh, hell, yeah. Yeah, bitch. Okay. Okay. All right. This comes in at 9 by 12. Oh, gross. Ten by 12, that's 120. Three by 9, that's... Shit. Oh, shit. Yeah. Nice and easy. Okay. Okay. Oh, baby. Oh, my God. Nine feet. Oh, my God. Jesus. Yo, yo! Anyone here? Okay. Okay. What the fuck is this? Okay. Yeah. Here we go. Oh, boy. Well... Ten... 10 feet. Oh, my God. What the fuck? Uh... Hello? Hello? Hello? ...by looking for indicators. I like to let my baby determine how long he likes to nurse. Oh, God. It's important that this process is relaxing. Not just for the baby, but for me as well. What the fuck? This is a... Hey! Shit! Shit! Who's there? Oh, shit! Oh, shit. Okay. Please. Oh, please. Fuck! Come on. Not again. Oh, shit! Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Shh! Shh!

She has killed a man already, and there could be someone down there getting murdered right now. Ma'am, there's no one in this building. No one's being murdered. And the only crime that I've seen so far is you breaking this window. What am I supposed to say to get you to listen to me? - Seriously, what the fuck? - Hey, Matt? We got shots fired on Midland. Wait, wait. Wait. Are you motherfuckers leaving? Hey! I've had enough of you. You're lucky we don't bring you downtown to sleep this off in jail. Sleep this off? Are you fucking kidding me?

Do you have any clean cloth or bandages or anything? Ain't much clean in here. I can't believe she let you get this far. What the fuck is she? She's just a crazy lady livin' in that house. Since when? She's been living there some 40 years now. She was born there. What are you talking about? I own that house. Nobody lives there. Boy, you might own that paper, but that's her daddy's house. And he ain't never left there, and she never left there neither. He used to bring women down there. And then he started making babies with 'em. And babies with the babies. And you make a copy of a copy of a copy, and you end up with something like that. She got you real good. I did that. It was an accident. Doesn't matter. We gotta get you help. Which way to get her help, huh? Y'all need to just sit right here and wait. I... I can't do that. This is my fault. It don't matter whose fault it is. It does! I hurt somebody! That matters. I don't know if I'm a bad person. But I might be. I might be a bad person. Or maybe I'm... I'm a good person who just did a bad thing. I can't... I can't change what I've done. I can just try and fix it. And that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna fix it. You ain't gonna do nobody no help if you go out there and get yourself killed. Now, right here, we're safe. And she's gonna make it through the night. Come morning time, then we can worry about takin' her to town. How do you know she can't get in here? Shit. I've been livin' in this place more than 15 years, and she ain't never came in this motherfucker. Shit! Oh, shit! Shit, shit, shit! Can't get over the fuckin' barbed wire. Wait for me! Fucking come on! Your gun! Oh. Fuck! There's nowhere to go. There's nowhere to fucking go! She wants us, she's gonna get us. She's never gonna stop. I can get away. But you're gonna have to slow her down. Hey! Don't. Come get your baby! Oh, fuck. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Are you okay? I'm so sorry. I had no choice, you know? She was gonna kill us both, and... I had no time to think. I fuckin' panicked. I didn't... I didn't even let go. You started to slip. There was nothin' I could do. You get it, right? Okay. You're... You're gonna be okay. I gotcha. I'm saving you. Yeah, you're okay. Ba-ba. I can't. I can't go back. Ba! I can't go back. Baby. Baby.
