(fast tempo upbeat music) (ominous music) (fast tempo upbeat music) (group chattering) (woman laughs) (sighs) Just go in and tell him. Don't be stupid. ♪ Telling me to go there ♪ Just do it. ♪ I can see ♪ Otherwise, he's gonna get married and that's it. (sighs) Why is this so hard? (Jennifer sighs) Sluts. ♪ I only have to see you ♪ (Jennifer sighs) Girl, you got this. (fast tempo upbeat music) Phones? Excuse me, this is a private event. Is your name on the list? I don't know. - First name. - Jennifer. Last name. [Jennifer] Robinson. Arms up, please. Go ahead. Phone. What for? This is a private event, no cell phones, ma'am. Oh, how do I get it back? Take this ticket, when you're ready to check out, come see us. You don't drop it, all right? Okay, you have a good night. [Jennifer] Thanks. (fast tempo upbeat music) (group chattering) Yeah. And everyone else- Can you imagine? I hope everyone does. - Oh, I do. - Really? Good. Jenny. No way. I didn't think you'd come. Well, you're getting married and with as craziest things have been who knows when I'll get to see you again. Yeah, I know. I mean, you know, it's been busy since the merger and- And you have another one coming up tomorrow night. Uh, yes, that is true. (laughs) Can I get two shots of whiskey? Coming right up. So with as busy as you have been and as busy as I'm sure you're gonna be, what I might see once every five years. Who's counting right? Um, that, right now, sure. It seems that way. But, um, listen, I'll make sure that we get our bestie time, okay? Don't even worry. Yeah. Bestie time. Yeah. You know, you, you got my number so you can always text me and we'll just set something up. [Jennifer] Well, I did, but you know, I, it was- Wait, well, no, no, you haven't. I mean, I, I've sent you plenty of messages and you basically just ignored me. I mean, I'm genuinely surprised you even showed up tonight. It's, it's crazy. I mean, I, I figured you were upset or, well, by the way, I hoped that you would come, and I'm really glad that you did. Yeah, Aus, you, you might wanna hold onto that. Well, listen, let me start out by saying I am upset. About what? It's not about you, but it's about myself. And I have been for a long while. And, and it's only because I haven't spoken about it sooner. It's pretty much the entire reason I came here tonight. Well, for how long? As long as you've been with Chelsi. But I, I'd really love to talk about it if you care to listen. Uh, of course, I'd like to. I mean, wait, does this have anything to do with- There's that fucking twat. Do you know how many gorgeous tits I passed up just to come find you? [Austin] Uh, three. Is that Jennifer? Hi, Angel. Oh, hi, darling. You always were hot, but I don't remember you being this hot. Aussie, has she always been this hot? Hey, can we have this conversations so I can go? Do you still work at the club? You know, the one over on south side, I forget the name of it. Nope, I don't. No. Well, where do you work at now? I'd love to come see you. Tell you my secrets. All my secrets. Yeah, no I retired five years ago, sweetie. Oh, what a shame. Well, good for you though moving on up to bigger and better things I see. But tell me, what are you doing these days? Escorting, camming? - Can we please? - Yikes. Yeah, sure. Hey, Angel, could you just hold down the bar for us real quick? Appreciate it. Thank you. (Angel grunts) Another please. [Austin] Yeah, I'm so sorry about Angel, I- [Jennifer] I'm surprised you've put up with her for this long. I, I, I know how she can get sometimes, but, you know- Dude, she's not even your cup of tea. - Wait! - Well, I mean, you know, she has her moments. - Austin. - Moments? - Where do you think- That's what you call them. Where do you think you're going? It's your bachelor party, mate. I brought you all these exotic dancers and you're running off with the retired one. I get it, you two have your history, but the festivities have just begun. Right, well, um, we're gonna step out and just talk for a bit. - No, no, no, no. - I'll be right back. No, no, no. There's no time for that, love. The party bus is scheduled to arrive at midnight so perhaps you two can take your conversation on board. I, I'm sorry, did you say party bus? I'm sorry, I, have we not spent enough money already? It's the last night that you get to live before becoming a eunuch. There's no such thing as enough. I think renting out an entire club was definitely enough. My dear friend, I went all out for you, so instead of bashing, how about a thank you? You know these kinds of shindigs aren't exactly easy to orchestrate. No, no, it's not that I'm not thankful, it's, it's, you know, I'm just saying, you know, financially speaking we're- Love, love, love, that's the problem. You're thinking the way you did before the merger, but now you're a multimillionaire, Aussie. Not yet. But you will be. And that's a beautiful thing because you earned it just like you earned tonight. You allowed this to happen. - Yeah. - I'm beginning to feel disrespected. Oh, feelings, I'm surprised you're capable. Can we please go somewhere right now? I'm not getting on that damn trashy bus. Oh, no, no, you're gonna love it. See, it has all the amenities that you're familiar with so I trust you'll feel right at home. I want to hit her right now, and it's going to happen. Oh my God, is that a party bus? (club patron cheers) (ominous music) Holy shit. Well, now it's not some damn trashy bus now is it? You're fucking welcome. Come on, you eunuch, and bring your pet. You two can have your chinwag on the bus. I really hate her. Um, I mean, I did technically pay for it. That's the sad part. Do you want to go? It would really mean a lot to me if you're able to share this night with me. Promise me one thing, if I get on that damn bus, you allow me to have this conversation with you. I can do that. (ominous music) (nose sniffing) Oh, bloody hell, I'm chopped to bits. Go on show us your white bits. (voice echoing) (fast tempo electronic music) (graphic thuds) (woman moaning) (screen whooshes) (graphic thuds) (woman panting) (ball thuds) (graphic chimes) (woman moans) (screen whooshes) (door jiggles) (slow tempo electronic music) (hat thuds) (body thuds) (hand slaps) (screen whooshes) (fast tempo electronic music) (knife thuds) (ominous music) (fast tempo electronic music) (knife clangs) (blood dripping) (fast tempo electronic music) (dramatic electronic music) (graphic thuds) (gentle electronic music) If I may, if I may, with the best of my abilities, I have a few words that I would love to share with you all about our dear boy who is about to take the plunge. I've known this good cunt for a million years or like would you say 12? Something like that. More than one, but less than two many. Do you remember how I met you? Yeah, uh, I've been trying to forget. (chuckles) Well, if you did, I'm absolutely sure Jennifer did not. Fuck off. You two were studying and I was just an innocent girl, new to the freedom of the American way, but what I learned in that moment was that Austin really isn't the kind of guy to say no. He is a generous giver though. In fact, some of his worst hangovers and most questionable decisions I proudly take credit for. But in all seriousness, Aussie has always been there for others. And I'm sure we all have a story to share. We are celebrating the death and rebirth of our incredible friend, boss, and brother. Now, I am aware that we all have our memorable stories, and though they do differ from one another, they all have him as the common thread. So let's go around and show our appreciation. Tony, kick us off. Oh, shit it's like that, huh? (group laughing) All right, all right. Where to start? Uh, I mean, there's many things I could speak on, but the one that probably means the most is the opportunity Austin gave me. For about a year I was his boss until he left the company. And like three years later, I was laid off. Spent about nine years there, three after Austin left. And we never really knew each other that well. But when I interviewed at his company without hesitation he offered me the CPA position and it, it saved me in more ways that I could even speak of. So tonight I toast to you. You deserve the best. Oh, he absolutely does. And how lucky are we all with that merger? Oh, the future was very brilliant for us all. Very promising. - Yeah. - Well, I think we all deserve a raise. (group laughing) Yeah, I'll check the budget. (group laughing) [Angel] Shandon. As some of you know, Jackie and I have been trying for some time to get pregnant, and it's been impossible. We've been going broke, trying everything under the sun, including IVF. We've tried so many second chances and we almost lost hope. But then we learned of the state-of-the-art process that was very promising, but completely out of our budget. I know Austin pays us well, but not well enough to afford a half a million dollar procedure. (sighs) I remember I was so nervous walking into his office asking him for help. But you know what? I'm glad I did. Thank you, Austin. Sweetie, you could have just fucked him. Aus, I'm really surprised you've stayed friends with this one for so long. I, how you doing? Uh, I, uh, actually, believe it or not, she's one of the better ones. I'm the best bitch. I'm sorry you didn't get the gig, sweetheart, but consistency is key. Well, things change. Perhaps, but with what I've pulled off tonight, I've earned it. Oh, spending somebody else's money to throw them a bachelor party. You sure did, sweetie. Oh, thank you. And on top of that, I have a very special surprise for our man Aussie here. Remember when you asked me to be your best woman? Uh, yes, I do. I wasn't the first choice. Who did you tell me was the first choice? Um, my brother. And when was the last time you heard from him? Uh, it's been about 15, 16 years ago. Right before he went to prison. Right. 16 years. Well, safe to say, it's been a long time coming, but I'm honored to say I found him. Are you high? Wait, wait, what? I mean, I'm sorry, what do you mean? I know I sound ridiculous, but that is who I am. Aussie, you are my best friend and I consider you a brother. But knowing what I know, I will happily stand down so that your brother can be your best man. You've gotta be kidding right now, right? You're way too fucked up. This is, can't be joked about. [Austin] I'm sorry, are are you being serious? I promised you this would be a night to remember. I love you, mate. Hey, Aus. (brooding music) It's been a long time, brother. What? You're really here. I am. I'm sorry, I, I just, this is blowing my mind. I, I, I can't believe it. Believe it. Angel told me all about you. I'm so proud of your success. I, I, I tried to contact you so many times. I know you did. I got every letter you sent. I couldn't, I couldn't write you back, I was too embarrassed. I just want you to know that I never met to leave you and Mom in the dark. I just had to forgive myself before I could ask anybody else to. You know, I promised her, I promised her that I would look out for you and I fucked that up. But I know I had a lot of people in my life I didn't deserve. I, I, I get that now. You know, when Mom passed, I, I was so lost. And I'm just lucky that John and Monica took me in. I wasn't in the most healthy place. I went through a lot of, a lot of dark shit and I had to be by myself for a while. I'm just glad that you found good people to have in your corner. There's just so much that, that I wanna talk to you about. I know, I know, but we have all the time in the world, and we're gonna need it to catch up. Tonight, tonight is about celebrating with you. So let's put this conversation on park, get back to the party. - Yeah. - Yes, mates, let's resume. He's not the bus driver then who is? My buddy Felix is. See, it's autonomous. Autonomous? [Sean] Self-driving. That's a thing. Well, not yet, but it will be eventually. This is the first of three prototypes. You can control it with a phone or. (watch beeps) (bus engine humming) (watch beeping) Pretty cool stuff, huh? Impressive. It will be once we work out all the bugs. Bugs? It has a mind of its own sometimes. Is it safe now? [Sean] I would say safe is a relative term. Holy fuck, man, you had me going there for a second. I had you going for more than a second. Look at this guy over here, he looks like he's shitting bricks. You all right, buddy? You're kind of sweating there. So I take it you're the one with the booger sugar. That would be him. [Sean] Can I taste? [John] Yeah, man. You? No, I don't, but you can. It's totally fine with me. I can appreciate that. Is it good? [John] Yeah. It's fire. I only sell the best. How is it? - Pretty good. - Damn right it's good. But I can get better. This is the best you're gonna get. Your brother's a bit of a cock isn't he? I like him. Of course you would. Ooh. What do you got there? This will blow your mind. Next time you need a bump get it off of that. I got plenty. Babe, are you good? I think Angel had the right idea. Let's get back into that conversation, only this time let's be a little more honest. Honest? Yeah, you know, not bullshitting, not telling lies. Honesty, just honesty. I mean, I, I think everyone was being honest. [Sean] Sure. Why do you say that? [Sean] I don't know, maybe it's the way you're talking. Maybe it's your tone. Maybe you're high and your interpretation is shit. Maybe. What do you think, Angel? You think Tony's right? [Tony] I know I'm right. It's difficult to say. I'm having trouble understanding where you're going with all this. It's difficult. It's all difficult. All of you are difficult, but the truth is simple. Lies are complex. Try, try not to hurt yourselves thinking about that too hard. Geez, get to the point. [Monica] He just fucking with us, Tony. [Jennifer] I'll second that. The games we play, especially this one. I'm very amused by all this. Good. And I hope you can keep that energy up because I have a proposal to make. You will have two options. You can either speak the truth or I'll kill you. (Angel gasps) [Jennifer] Oh, what the fuck dude, that's messed up. If your brother doesn't stop fucking with us, I'm gonna go into labor. Yeah, Sean, come on, let's just, uh, keep it light. Yeah, this is starting to get really weird. You seem to always have a lot to say. No, but apparently you do. No, it's not about me. It's about all of you. It's about my brother. Why don't you just sit down and let the snow settle, mate? Sure, after we all speak the truth. [Tony] Dude, you are fucking high. (nose sniffing) Oh, this is gonna be a long night. Hey, Sean, um, tell me what the joke is. I mean, what's this all about? Yeah. Prison gave me a very specific sense of humor. Just know that this is all intentional and in the end it'll all make sense. What will? [Sean] Everything. I just need you to trust me. I, I'm starting to think I don't even know you anymore. [Sean] Now see, that's the thing you need to ask yourself. You need to ask yourself, do you know you? [Shandon] I'm not feeling this anymore. I just wanna go home. Yeah, that sounds like a solid idea. Felix, take us home. All right, we're heading back now. Your brother is seriously lost the plot. He's gone and spun out of works, Aussie. Fuck. Shandon. That's my name. [Sean] Do you know what section you're sitting in? No. The C section. (knife thuds) (suspenseful music) Oh, what the what? (blood splattering) (Shandon screaming) Fuck! Oh, my God! (screaming) (Shandon screaming) (ominous music) (flesh squishing) (Shandon screaming) (ominous electronic music) (Shandon screaming) (vomit spraying) (Shandon screaming) Fucking seriously! (fist thuds) No! Oh God why? Why? (body thuds) No! (screaming) (brakes squeak) [Monica] Oh, my god! Uh, you, uh, you guys thought I was, uh, you guys thought I was playing. (knife thuds) (Monica crying) What the fuck, man? (Shandon gurgling) Is everyone taking me seriously now? [Monica] She's fucking choking. Yeah, that's the idea. Sean, what are you doing? She's dying. [Sean] What am I doing? (gun bangs) Fuck. (Jennifer crying) (ominous music) (Tony panting) (Shandon gurgling) Jesus, that bitch won't die. (gun bangs) (Angel screams) (Monica screams) Oh, my god, get the fuck off me. Shut the fuck up. Now look, Austin, I'm sorry I did this on such an important night, but I made you and Ma a promise. As for the rest of you, each and every one of you earned your seat on this bus. Now, the rules are simple. You either speak the truth or I burn you with it. Now, we don't have a lot of time. I have a schedule to keep. So if any of you try anything brave, just remember you're gonna lose your opportunity to speak. This, this is not a safe place. (gun clicks) I hope you can comprehend that. (gun clicks) (urine splashing) That's my least favorite part. Sean! What the hell happened to you? Nothing. I'm just keeping a promise. A promise? What fucking promise? You're not well, man. Yeah, we know that. I never have been. But you know you know, it's all about love. Hey, Felix. (watch beeps) Let's go home. (bus engine humming) Aus, Aus. We need to get outta here. Aus. - If you can't tell, he's clearly not okay and this whole thing is fucked. We need to rush him. Bullshit. And the gun? And? [Angel] And fuck that. We have to try something. It's obvious this guy us fucking nuts. If we just sit here we guarantee his promise. I'm with Jennifer on this. So am I. Okay, I see you're all fucking mad. And me? No, I'll take my chances. You are such a fucking coward. What's that? What are you guys doing in that little huddle back there? Trading secrets? Aus, Aus, you know, your friends are really good at keeping secrets. Don't worry, we'll be on the highway soon. What about your husband? What about 'em? [Jennifer] Can we use him? Not in that condition. I don't think he knows where he is. Can you wake him up? A big guy like that could really do some damage. Yeah, if we could wake him up with the four of us, I think we can do it. Did you all wake up this morning and think you, yay, this is a great day to fucking commit suicide? Well, it was great knowing all of you. (fist thuds) (Angel gasps) I love that we're all getting along. [Angel] What the fuck? You wanna act like a bitch, I'll treat you like one. You know what? Fuck all of you. You're telling me our only hope is just to casually rush him, hope for the best. Shut up. Is there any other option? There's always another option. Oh, shit, from what we've witnessed tonight, I'm convinced we only get one. She's right. You know she is. We need to stick together. Yo, we need your fucking help. All right, we just need to try to wake him up. [Jennifer] Yeah, can you do it? I can try. It just depends on what he's on. Do you know what he's on? Everything. Don't worry, I got this. I wouldn't do anything stupid. (ominous music) Neither would I. I just wanna sit next to my husband. Or is that not okay? I don't care what the fuck you do. Just don't be stupid. (Monica sighs) [Monica] John. John, baby. John, baby, I need you to wake up for me. John. Oh my God. Johnny. Come on, Johnny. Come on, Johnny. Wake up, baby. Come on. Come on. Please, baby, wake up for me, please. Please, baby, come on. I don't know what I think about this. Aus, what sort of company are you running here? What is this some sort of voyeurism group? [Monica] Please, baby. Come on, yeah. Aus. You can't answer me. You can't fucking answer me. [Monica] Come on. No. [Sean] No? After all this time, building up this big successful business, and you still can't speak up. Speak the fuck up, bro. Say it from your chest. [John] More. No. [Sean] No, what? No, we're not some voyeurism group. [Sean] Ah, that's terrible. We need to work on your vocal presence. [Monica] Come on, baby, please wake up for me. (John grunts) (metal thuds) She would be disappointed with who you've become. [Sean] I haven't changed. What do you think I went to prison for? She would always tell me about how she wished you'd come home and that you changed your ways. [Monica] Okay. All right, here you go. I'm glad she's not here to learn the truth. [Sean] Aus, there is so much you don't know. Depends on how far we get tonight. I'll, I'll talk to you about it. There's nothing to talk about. [Sean] I would have to disagree, but for the sake of argument, just know that you don't know what I know. And if you knew what I knew, then you'd know. [Monica] Okay, all right, here you go. All right, when you take this hit, baby, I need you to go fuck up the driver for me, okay? I need you to fuck with the driver for me. - Why? - Can you do that? Because he told us we don't deserve our children. Can you do that for me? Come on, come on, baby. That motherfucker said that shit? [Monica] Yeah, baby, he did, he did. You bitch ass motherfucker! [Monica] Come on, come on. [Sean] Can't help but thank you guys. (gun bangs) (suspenseful music) (Jennifer screams) (Monica panting) What the fuck is so funny? Oh, I told him it'd blow his mind. Dude, you are seriously fucked in the head. You know, it's all right though. We are now back on the highway, which means we can get back to the intent of tonight. Uh, we have what? We have 40, 45 minutes to go. Now excluding my brother and whoever that is on the floor back there, we all need to have a very important conversation. So let's everybody gather around in a little circle and you know, we're all friends here. Let's, let's talk. No. No? You're not gonna hurt my friend. Well, I'd say it's a little late for that now, wouldn't you? No, it's not. Yes, it is. You know, Austin, you could have pulled this hero act about 16 years ago, but it's okay, tonight you're gonna grow a backbone. You're gonna learn how to defend yourself. Your friends, I don't care what happens to them. It's all up to them. Enough is enough. You piece of shit. I knew you knew. John knew you knew. Why else? You set us up. You set us all up. No, Monica, I, I would never hurt you, any of you. I, you, you and John were there for me when, when my mom passed and, and he, and he wasn't. I don't believe this. And, and I'm right here with you. I trying to figure out how, how we got into the situation. And I'm not scared of my brother anymore. You were scared of me? I don't believe this. Was this the only option, Austin? Now he had nothing to do with this. This is about you guys. I know I do, but I can play too. I can get really violent. Oh, I know you can. I've read all about you. That's why you and him have special seats on this bus. Just remember, you can always speak the truth. He already knows. And I don't give a fuck anymore! He doesn't, that's the whole point of this. You guys have to tell him. Save me the embarrassment. Wait, what am I missing? Cut the shit. Fuck both of you! (flesh tearing) (dramatic music) (gun clanging) [Sean] (grunts) Get off me you crazy bitch. You want violence? I'll give you violence, baby. (gun clanging) Oh, fuck. What did I say? No stupid. Are you doing something stupid? No. [Sean] Are you telling me the truth? Yes. We're on the honor system here. There's been some very serious questions raised tonight. Just keep in mind, you're gonna have one opportunity. Are you on some dumb shit? No, I'm telling the truth. No dumb shit. What are you doing at the front of the bus? Answer the fucking question! I'm sorry. I'm scared to answer. I moved because I didn't wanna get hurt in the fight. And I am where I'm at because the bus stopped suddenly. Please, that's the honest truth. No, you're lying to me. No, I'm not Sean, please. Sean. She's telling the truth. [Sean] Now you're lying to me. Look, I might not know whatever it is that you know, but, but I know her and, and she isn't lying. You know, that's, that's incredible. Here I was watching her eyes dilate, seeing her posture change, listening to her breath grow shallow, what would I know? I don't care what you know. I, I want nothing to do with you. You know, Monica said, we're all on the same team. I like what I'm seeing. I think we're all heading in the right direction. Thank you. Now everyone, let's come forward so that we can finally end this. Each and every one of you are here tonight because in some which way or another, you either took advantage of or betrayed my brother. Now that is the truth we are going to speak on. Angel, let's start with you. (watch beeps) Felix, lights. (lights click) Right. Me. Go on. Show us your white bits. My white bits. Well, first I'd like to begin with a sincere apology. If it wasn't for my ambition to always go above and beyond, I feel tonight would've gone much differently. (sighs) Sean is asking for truth, so I highly recommend that each and every one of you follow my lead. Aussie, I've always loved you. And I called you a brother because you are the closest that I've ever had to one. I know you feel the same about me, and I would never take advantage of you. But I can't say the same about everyone else on this bus. And those at the club, they were the lucky ones. Well, technically no, but go on. Why you say such a trivial thing? Everyone had the same opportunity. What are you saying? Monica, you seem like a very smart woman. Are they others like this? Not like this, no. But it was a similar situation at the club. The club? All of them? Yes. Those were innocence. My sisters were at that party. Well, in all fairness, you should have seen this coming. I'm not proud of what I've done, but, uh, it had to be done. Those are my fucking baby sisters. (Sean grunts) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Monica. Monica, stop please. Monica, please stop. Please. Defend yourself. [Austin] No. No, Monica! Get off me, please! - Hit that fucking bitch. - Please! - Hit her. [Austin] Monica. (grunting) Oh, fuck me. (Austin grunting) (glass shattering) (Austin grunting) (Austin and Monica grunting) (knife thuds) (Monica groans) Chill, bitch! You at this coming. Fuck you! Fuck all of you! What a good little girl. You dick! I've never seen this side of you before. Don't play stupid. Sean, what's going on? I, I, I need some context here. Well, that's what this night is all about, bringing out the truth! Fuck you, fuck you! Fuck you guys. Fuck all of you! Aus! [Monica] Fuck you. You're up. Take the goddamn knife. What are you giving me this for? Because I want you to use it while I hold her down. Use it for what? What have I been doing all night? I want you to use it to cut the bitch's fucking head off! No. No! Oh, good. (Jennifer crying) [Tony] Fuck, fuck. (Angel screaming) (Jennifer crying) (Angel whimpering) All right. Now this is not going to go the way you're imagining it in your minds, so don't be stupid. In case you haven't noticed, this bus is constructed to keep people inside. Soundproof, bulletproofed, and wired with enough explosives to blow all you sky high. Now, I don't want to hurt anybody on the outside. What you guys need to know right now is a simple term, collateral fucking damage. Now, don't fuck with your lives. We're fucked either way. Help! (gun bangs) (Tony groans) I did say soundproofed, right? All right, everybody head this way. Hello. My name is Officer Audrey Lambmask with the State Highway Police. If you can hear me, I need you to come to the front of the bus. All right no dumb shit. [Angel] (whimpering) Oh my God. (head thuds) Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Sir, I need you to step off the bus. Are you deaf or hard of hearing? I know a little bit of sign language. I need you to step outside so we can talk. Yes. Talk about the bus. (door hissing) (Stephanie groans) (Stephanie grunts) (door hissing) My name is Officer Lambmask. I'm not deaf. Uh, I have a condition with my ears. Is something I can help you with? (Stephanie screaming) Yes, first I need your papers. Then we need to go back to the cruiser. Why? It's too dangerous to be this close to the highway, sir. Okay. Thank you. No, no, hey, hey, hey, wait. We need your fucking help. Angel, get your girl. Oh, fuck me. Help, we need some fucking help! No wait, come back! We need your fucking help! Come back. What the fuck? We need your help. Come back. Hey, hey, hey! Stephanie! [Stephanie] You stay the fuck back you piece of shit. Love, I need you to calm down. That man out there, Sean, he is not well. He did all of this. I don't know a fucking Sean. Let me off this fucking bus. I can't. I don't know how. [Stephanie] You're lying. I don't fucking trust you. [Angel] I am not lying. [Stephanie] You know what? I'll fucking stab you. - Fine, fine. Fuck you, fuck this, fuck all of you. She is not listening. Chill out, okay? You need to calm the hell down. You need to join us in the back so we can figure out how to get the fuck outta here. 'Cause that crazy fucker out there is gonna come back here and find a reason to kill you. And I'm not planning to stick around for that. So the decision's up to you. Let's go. (knife clicking) (sighs) Dude, how's a leg? It went clean through, but I can't stop the bleeding. Angel, give him your jacket. Fuck off. Use one off the dead or use one of your own. I'm not gonna help somebody who got themself in a shit situation. Sweetie, we're all in this situation. Well, some of us aren't breathing or bleeding. Oh my gosh, you're fucking disgusting. [Angel] We all have our days, sweetheart. [Stephanie] I don't understand what's going on. [Angel] Welcome back to the party. None of us do. What happened to all these people? What happened to him? Well, he got shot and the rest of them some other stuff. Who did all of this? Aussie's dear brother Sean. This is so fucked. You've got that right. I'm sorry guys. You're sorry. Is is that gonna do anything sorrys? No, no, it's not. Sorry isn't gonna undo any of this shit. Instead of sitting there feeling sorry, you should do something. Like what? What would you want me to do? Well, it's pretty fucking obvious. I mean, your brother's not gonna hurt you, so you should be the one to stop him. He comes back in, you two get into it, and then we'll get out and, and then get help. And in the case that we're wrong, your death wouldn't be in vain. He's he's quite a point. No, that is a terrible idea. [Angel] How? When have you known him to fight? Talk shit? He's not like you. Angel. Then what do you suggest? Not that. What about that? It's probably locked like everything else in this fucking bus. Look, our best bet is for all of us to rush him. He can't stop us all, all right? We, we, we, we put Austin in front so he can't target any of us. That's our only option. Did you check to see if it was locked? Jesus Christ, everything is. It would be. But did you check? No. Fucking shit. I don't know how to fucking unlock this. Goddamn shit. Oh. Grab that curtain. [Jennifer] I'll do my best. (bus engine humming) (watch beeping) (watch beeps) Come on, hurry up. - I'm trying, fucking trying. - Fuck. Get up. Get up, get up. Ooh, fuck, how much do you fucking weigh? You need to go higher. I can't pull myself. Let me take off my jacket. Oh, God, get off, get down, get off. How's it looking out there? Uh, he's still there. It, it looks like the cop went back to her car. Let us know if anything changes we're trying to get her outta here. All right, get fucking over here. (bus engine humming) Okay, everything looks good. The reason I pulled you over is because you are just too close to the highway. I need you to scoot over. It's, it's just too dangerous. Um, if you need to, there's a rest stop about 15 miles that way. - That way? - Yes. - 15 miles. - Correct. That's great, I'm gonna put that into my GPS. Me and my wife have been traveling for a while now. We're just getting used to the ways of the road. Is there anything else I can do for you? No, that should be it. Oh, here one second. Put your foot in. Put, come on, put some effort into it. (Tony grunting) Ah, hold on. Don't want you leaving without your documents. Thank you. Uh, I hope you have a great night. Stay safe out there. Thank you. You as well. And thank you for your service. Guys, guys, he's coming. Shit. All right, real quick, I'm gonna go help Austin. Can you manage to get her up and out with your leg? Easy. Okay. (Tony grunts) (door hissing) (ominous music) What the fuck are you doing? I just wanted a seat that wasn't covered in my friend's blood. Get out of that seat, get back there. Where's the girl? She's in the back. And the curtain. I wanted to give her a bit of privacy while she cleans herself up. Okay, okay, stop, stop. Get down, get down. She doesn't seem like the kind of person who would care. Yeah, well, she's feeling a bit vulnerable. What about the one with a bullet hole? He's also in the back. Helping her clean up? No, he's unconscious. That's the problem with you guys' lies, it sounds good at first, but there's no subtext. You know what? Believe whatever you may. It's a great buffer. Gives you plenty of time to come up with supporting facts, eliminate self-doubt, but at the end, the problem is always the same, no subtext. Whatever, love. Jennifer, what was it about the night that brought you and Angel together? It didn't. No. (dramatic music) Ah, yes, subtext. (metal creaking) (Tony grunts) (metal slices) (blood dripping) Fuck. Shit. Looks like our boys up. (blood splashing) Fuck. Stephanie. What the fuck? Shit. (blood splashing) (body thuds) (Tony panting) Stephanie. (chain thuds) (head thudding) Fuck. What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? Shit. (gun bangs) (Tony groaning) (gun banging) Shit! Fuck this, fuck this. (gun bangs) (Tony grunts) (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (Tony grunting) (hand thudding) (door hissing) (knife thuds) (Tony groans) [Tony] Fuck. (body thudding) [Sean] Back the fuck up. Get out of the way. (door thuds) What do you think he's doing? I don't know. (air hissing) Shit. (drone whirring) Are you hearing that? (drone whirring) (heavy metal music) Of course it's a fucking drone. (drone whirring) (bus engine humming) (heavy metal music) (drone whirring) (bus engine humming) (heavy metal music) (drone whirring) (bus engine humming) (heavy metal music) (drone whirring) I don't think our boy's going to make it. Aren't you the optimist? Shit. (drone whirring) (drone whooshes) (drone whooshing) (bus engine humming) (drone whirring) (bus engine humming) (drone whirring) (drone clicking) (Tony screams) (knife slashes) God. (door bangs) (Sean sighs) We're running behind so there's been a change in plans. I seriously consider you take this time to think about your truths. Truths, truths. Austin, I think it's about time that we had that conversation. No, no. It, it's okay, we could, it can wait. Uh-uh, no, it's waited long enough. Let me start by saying you are an absolutely beautiful human being. And no matter the outcome tonight, you deserve so much better than all of us. I, I can't say that I agree. Please let me talk, okay? My truths, my truths are disgusting. (Jennifer crying) While we were dating, I cheated on you. (gentle music) (Jennifer crying) And as time went on it kept happening. And it wasn't fair to you that I didn't know how to quit. (Jennifer crying) I, I found myself torn between these two worlds that I craved, so I broke off with you. I just wanted to be left alone. You kept asking me why and I knew that the truth would hurt you more than a lie. And you deserve so much better so I said nothing. (crying) For the longest time it was hell. Once time went on, it got a little easier. That's when I allowed myself to start talking to you again. Hey. You remember who this is? (Jennifer crying) You kept getting busier and busier and my wait time got longer and longer. And once that's when I found myself entertained by the gossip, and I started putting the faces to the names. And that's when I realized that the conversations were about your employees here. Tony got really creative with stealing a lot of money from you. And Shandon, she told you that she and her girlfriend were trying to have a baby. She was already pregnant when she approached you for the money. And I heard she had abortions prior to that. There's a lot more. And I'm sure Angel could tell you about it. Sad thing is we know she won't 'cause she only serves her own agenda. Hats to you. I know you came here just to convince him to call off the wedding. But before we get into that, why don't you tell him who the other was. Who would send you to the gods and teach you languages that you didn't even know existed. Tell them the name that you would scream every night until you fucked it while you cried. I'm sure they would love to know who could please you. It was Angel. I cheated on you with Angel. (Jennifer crying) I did come here tonight to ask him to call it off with Chelsi, not for my benefit, but for his. Chelsi plans on leaving you one year after the merger and giving half of everything to Angel. They know that your kindness is your weakness. And that's where the manipulation was gonna begin. At first, you'd feel guilty and then you just give into whatever Chelsi wanted. And as wild as that sounds, that is how Chandon got half a million from you. Is this true? No. Let's not be ridiculous in the name of saving face. I do have a curiosity though. That was quite an elaborate story, don't you think, Austin? Care to share how you concocted it? (brooding electronic music) I, uh, I, I don't mean to offend you, but how did you discover all this? Well shit, somebody actually did it. Sean, don't please! Get up. Dude, I fucking told the truth, what more do you want? No, you didn't. Fuck you, you piece of shit. Get up. (Jennifer whimpering) (bus engine humming) Dude, were you just fucking with us? I need you to take 15 steps back. And what did you want me to say? Back the fuck up. Austin. I love you. I'm so sorry for everything. Stop. Now turn around and get on your knees. (crying) It's okay. Everything will be all right. Everything will be all right. (Jennifer crying) (brooding music) It was always that simple. I don't know how this all got out of hand. Maybe it was the drugs or the alcohol. Maybe it was pride. And I think you guys are right, it wasn't pride, it was arrogance. Can you just shut up? I like that. She isn't lying, is she? Remember the truth will set you free. Sean. [Sean] Just saying. You know, I used to always get this feeling that I just couldn't shake off, but I feel like I need to embrace it now. I want you to look me in the eye and tell me that what she said isn't true. What's unfair is regardless of what I say, I can already tell you've made up your mind about what the truth is. Just know that Chelsi loves you. She's a good girl. (ominous music) I've always felt terrible for sleeping with Jennifer. It was never my intention to do so, but with thee long, long nights and alcohol it was bound to happen. When she left you to pursue me, I could not bear the consequences of my actions so I immediately cut it off. I hated myself. (Angel chattering) (Angel chattering) My loyalty has always been to you. Please. (Angel chattering) What is this? My truth. (Chelsi moaning) Say my name. (Chelsi moaning) Angel. - Say my name. - Angel. [Angel] Good girl. [Chelsi] Oh, my Angel. She loved me before she loved you. What is this, Sean? (Chelsi chattering) (Chelsi moaning) [Angel] Come my darling. Oh, my God. (moaning) [Angel] Tell me, love, are you looking forward to getting married? Can't wait for the divorce. Hold on. And we are gonna be rich together. All he's good for is his fucking money. And we're gonna take it all. [Angel] Oh, my love, you are so right. Before me, huh? [Chelsi] Time for me to play with you. Bravo, mate. The humility is mine. (Chelsi moaning) You can turn it off now. [Chelsi] Oh, pull my hair. After the good part. Turn it off. I don't wanna see this shit anymore. (Chelsi moaning) All right. You lied. Oh, Aussie, you're absolutely brilliant at coding, but in everything else, you're a fucking idiot. We're here. Now get the fuck out both of yous. You first, mate. Ladies first. Bitch. I feel so much anger towards you, towards everyone. I feel betrayed. Feel whatever you like. But do me a favor, take responsibility for the events that occurred tonight. Face your truth! You allowed this to happen, you spineless fucking coward. Oh, look at you quivering in fear. Anxiety. It's just anxiety. Now, Austin, tell me, what do you feel when you look at her. Anger. Frustration. Now tell me, what would you like to do to her? I want to see her hurt. Hurt. What sort of hurt? Are we talking about feelings hurt? Are we talking about like a bum fucking knee? What sort of hurt? Like not breathing hurt. See, it's in our blood. When you pull that trigger, you're finally gonna be winning back ownership of your life. I want to. Sean, despite the truth being told, do I not get the opportunity to live? Honestly, you were the only one guaranteed to die tonight. Lucky me. Oh, go on then. I just, I don't know if killing you is going to take away any of the pain. Coward. [Sean] There, it's a little more personal. That's not what I meant. Well, this is just about as personal as it gets. Beat her fucking ass. What are we doing here? I, I, I, I, I can't fight. Oh, for Christ's sake. I'm not always gonna be here to protect you. You have to learn to stand up for yourself. Now I'm gonna leave you to this. I gotta take care of the bus. (knife thuds) I've always wanted to see your face break. I wanna see you suffer. (fist thudding) (Austin groans) (knee thuds) (Austin groans) You fucking piece of shit. (Austin groans) Fucking coward, fight back. Fight the fuck back, Austin! (Austin groaning) (gas splashing) Stand up and fight for once in your fucking life. [Austin] Fuck you, Angel! Oh, shit! (bodies thudding) I want you to start to fight back! (fist thudding) (gas splashing) (Angel yelling) Come on you piece of shit! (Austin grunting) (fist thuds) (ominous music) Aussie! Aussie. Goddammit! (Austin grunting) (foot thuds) (Austin groans) Oh, fucking piss. (knife thuds) Goddammit! (groans) Fucking piece of shit. Fuck you. (Austin grunting) (Angel yells) (Austin screams) Motherfucker! Fuck, he really can't fight. (gas splashing) How does that feel, huh? How does that feel, Aussie, huh? (Austin groaning) Fucking, oh, take it like a man. Oh, you fucking coward. (Austin groaning) All right, I'm coming. Fuck. [Angel] Fucking hell. (Angel groaning) (can thuds) Time's up. Oh, hell no. Oh my God. (ominous music) (fire roaring) (Angel panting) [Sean] How you feeling, brother? [Austin] Physically like shit. Emotionally, really good. My hand hurts. [Sean] Yeah, I can tell you got a knife in it. [Austin] Yeah, that, that makes sense. (Austin groans) [Sean] You wanna learn something cool? Sure. Follow me. Where are you going now? Now I'm gonna teach you a technique. It's one of my favorites. Totally consistent across the board. The ankle is a very complex structure. It opens so many creative possibilities. This, (Angel screaming) this is the achilles tendon. Stop, please stop! Please. When you absolutely, positively gonna make sure a motherfucker ain't going anywhere except no substitutes. Now you. [Angel] Aussie. Right here. That's it. (flesh tearing) [Angel] No, please stop! Oh, the begging you're so terrible at. So, uh, so what do you up to tomorrow? I was, uh supposed to get married. Huh, you're still going through with that? (Austin chuckles) Uh, I don't think so. You know, I, I got a couple more days left on my vacation. You wanna hang out? Yeah. And I, I have to ask, I, I, how'd you find me? (Angel screaming) I never lost you. I never lost you. See when I was locked up, (flesh tearing) Ma kept coming to see me. Every day I would deny her visits, but eventually I gave in, allowed her to. Then she told me some of the things about you that concerned her. People hurting you. And I learned about John and, uh, Monica. Yeah, how Ma owed them money and they wanted you to come work for them. Mom wasn't gonna have you throw away your life. She kept quiet and did it herself. Working for those people eventually got her killed. When I was released, I joined the military. I discovered I had a gift. Spent years refining it. I, uh, I always had someone checking up on you. It was when I heard about the marriage and that whole, that whole thing, that I needed to take a vacation. I put in the request and it was approved. I had one of the girls plant the seed in her head and as I predicted, she took the bait. I bought the bus, had my team make certain modifications. And clearly, you know, I'm not in this for the business. So I offered a price that was too tempting for someone like her to pass up. We finished setting up the bus about, I don't know, maybe about six hours before we had to be there. Me and the guys we spray painted it, still wet when we pulled up at the club. I think it turned out all right. Do you think that the bus should have exploded by now? No. See explosions, they, they spread evidence far and wide. You gotta let it burn for a little while before it goes boom. Are we a, are, are we safe here? Probably not. We need to drag her back closer. Use your good hand. (knife thuds) (Angel grunting) So are you like a secret agent or something? Definitely secret, but no, I'm just a guy who knows how to ask all the right questions to get an honest answer. There's so much I wanna know about you. I got so many questions. I'm not really that interesting. Not that interesting? Not compared to you. (Austin laughs) I find that hard to believe. [Sean] Believe it. I'm telling you the truth. What is that? This is a wedding gift. Or at least it was when I got it for you. What is it? We'll open the goddamn box. It's kind of heavy. (paper rustling) Is that? (explosion booming) Well, it was either, it was either that or a toaster. (Austin laughs) (ominous electronic music) I'm glad it wasn't the toaster. You know, I'm really glad that you came along. Yeah, me too. You got some great friends. (Austin chuckles) Let's head on outta here. (explosion booming) (fire roaring) (explosion booming) (ominous music) (nose sniffing) Oh, bloody hell, I'm chopped to bits. Go on, show us your white bits. What these? ♪ My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard ♪ ♪ And damn right, they're better than yours ♪ ♪ Damn right, they're better than yours ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh. ♪ (group laughing) (fast tempo electronic music) (ominous music)
