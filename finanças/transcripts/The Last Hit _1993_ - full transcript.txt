(silence) (piano playing) (no audible dialogue) (dramatic drums) (no audible dialogue) (muffled gunfire) (gunshots) (somber music) (sobbing) (doorbell rings) (tense music) (tense music continues) (muffled gunshot) (sad violin music) - Yeah, it's Simon. - How'd the job go? - The job's done. - Clean? - No mess. - Alright, meet me tomorrow 10am, usual place. - Okay. - It's birthday girl! - Stop! - Time to put on the annual hat! - Mom! - I'm not wearing... No, god. - No, you have to wear the hat. - You have to wear the hat. - I hate that thing, no. - Those are the rules, birthday hat. - I'm not wearing the hat! - You have to wear the hat, please? - No one wears this hat! - One thing a year - Wear the hat - That's all I want you to do - Put on the hat. - For me, for your dad... - Put on the hat. - For your dad, for your dad. - That's the... Aww, look how cute she looks! - Oh, look it's so cute! - Fine, fine. - Happy birthday - Okay, okay, okay, now enough, enough hat, enough of the hat. - Happy birthday, sweetie. - Okay, okay. (all laugh) - Looks great, okay! Yay, she's wearing the hat. - It's birthday girl! - Stop! - Time to put on the annual hat! - Mom! - I'm not wearing... No, god. - No, you have to wear the hat. - You have to wear the hat. - I hate that thing, no. - Those are the rules, birthday hat. - I'm not wearing the hat! - You have to wear the hat, please? - No one wears this hat! - One thing a year - Wear the hat - that's all I want you to do - Put on the hat. - For me, for your dad... - Put on the hat. - For your dad, for your dad. - That's the... Aww, look how cute she looks! - Oh, look it's so cute! - Fine, fine. (doorbell rings) - What the hell's this? - Sal told me I can't leave until I get an answer. - Well tell him I said the answer's no. - He says you have to do it. - Okay. Alright, tell him yeah. (gloomy music) (door knock) - Who are you? Where's Sal? - Sal's not here yet. - Do you work for him or something? - Yeah, I work for him. Who are you and why does Sal want you dead? - Sal wouldn't hurt me. He loves me. - Then why'd he send me? - He didn't, you're lying. - I'm being paid to be here, you can believe me or not. - Are you gonna shoot me? - Stop crying. - No! - Look, I'm not gonna shoot you, okay? Does he know where you live? What the hell's that? Answer me, does he know where you live? - Yes. He knows where I live. - Then you can't go home. - Why not? - It's pretty simple. You can't ever go home, ever. If you do, he's gonna kill you, and then he's gonna kill me for not killing you. Do you understand? - I don't care! There's nothing there anyways. - Is there somewhere you can go? Some place where he wouldn't be able to find you? - I don't think so. - I can give you some money. You can go anywhere you want. Do you have a friend, a relative, somebody who lives out of state somewhere? - No. My mom, she died. I don't know anybody else. - Then you're gonna have to come with me, then. - Where? - Someplace safe. - I'm not going 'til you tell me where! - I'm trying to help you, okay? - Believe me, I can tell. When people wave guns in my face, they're usually trying to help. - We're going to my place if that's, you know, okay with you. - Alright. - Then come on, and don't make a fuss. (piano keys plink) - Who plays? (shutters close) - My wife. - Is this her? - Yeah, and my daughter. - Where are they? - I don't really want to talk about it, okay? (shutters close) - Okay. - Down that hallway there, second room on the right. Not the first room, that's my room. You should be able to find some of my daughter's old clothes in there, in case you need to change. - I'm not really tired at the moment. - Don't make me regret this. Yeah. Job's done. No mess. Okay. (foreboding music) - Hey boss, somebody wants to talk to you. - Do I know you? - This is the guy. - He's the guy? You lost your kid, I'm sorry to hear about that. So tell me, what can I do for you? - You know who's responsible for my daughter's death. I want to know who they are. - Do you, now? Take a seat, we'll have a chat. You a cop? Answer me! - No. - Carmine, why don't you get us some espressos, please? - Sure thing. - So what is it you're looking for? - I wanna kill 'em all. - Ever kill a man before? And what makes you think you can? - I know I can. (rock music) (fire alarm beeps) Kid? (rock music) (fire alarm beeps) Kid, where are you? (rock music) (fire alarm beeps) - I made eggs and bacon! I was gonna make pancakes, but I don't really know how. You sure like that gun, don't you? - I've gotta go out for a while. Don't answer the phone. Don't go near the doors or windows. I'll be back. - But I made breakfast. - Look kid... - Gabby. - Gabby, whatever. Just because I didn't shoot you doesn't mean I want to be your friend. I've already got lots of friends, I don't need any more. - I can tell. With a personality like yours, you probably have tons. - No doors, no windows. - Nice talking to you. (dramatic music) - That's the last one, I'm done. - Holy shit, I thought you were a mute. - Did you hear what I said? - Yeah, I heard you. What is it, your conscience bothering you? - That girl didn't do shit and you know it. - How do you know? Hell, I don't even know what she did. Difference is, I don't care. - I've done a lot of killing for you, that's the first time you've sent me to do someone that didn't have it coming. - Look at this. All this money. You know what regular people got to do to make this much money? All you have to do is this. You just gonna walk away from that? What are you gonna do, wait tables? - I've got some money saved. I'll be fine, don't worry about me. - I gotta tell you, Sal ain't gonna like this. - Don't threaten me. - I'm not threatening you. I'm not the one you need to be afraid of. You should know that people that leave the life, they tend to make him nervous. And people that make him nervous, well, they have a way of ending up dead. - Do me a favor, just pass it on. - Aren't you forgetting something? Good luck. - Excuse me, excuse me. Do you have a light? 1% prick. Fuck! (phone rings) - No way. Philly! I thought you said the girl was dead? - That's what they told me. - Baby, is that you? - Yeah. - Where were you last night? - I was there. Where were you? - I was running a little bit late, baby. - There was some guy there. - Who? - This guy, he had a gun. He said that you sent him to hurt me. - Who said this? - Oh, I don't know his name. - You know me, I would never hurt you. I love you, babe. - I know, but... - But nothing. Just tell me where you are and I'll come and get you myself. - I can't. - Why not? - I'm afraid. - It's okay, I understand. Tell you what. Why don't you call me when you're ready for me to come and get you, okay? Son of a bitch! That's all I need, is for my wife to find out about this girl. - What do you wanna do? - Get over to Simon's house. I bet you my balls to a bag of donuts, she's there right now. And Philly. - Yeah? - If I never see neither one of them again, this would be a good thing. - Got it. (melancholy violin music) (dramatic music) (Simon sighs) - I've been thinking about it. If we stay here, sooner or later somebody's gonna figure it out. - You really are trying to help me, aren't you? - Yeah, what do you think I've been doing? Why are you upset? - I think I might've made a mistake. - What did you do? - You're gonna be mad. - What did you do? - I called Sal. - I'm sorry, it just sounded like you said that you called Sal, but I know you couldn't have done that because that'd be the dumbest thing ever. - I think it's okay, though. He asked me where we were, but I wouldn't tell him. - No, it's not okay. It's a million miles away from okay. You know what you just did? You do what you want, you're on your own. I'm done with you. - Then why did you even save me? - 'Cause you reminded me of someone. - Please don't turn your back on me. (shutters slam) - If I were you, I'd go out the back door. - Fine, then I'm leaving! And if they get me, it's your fault. - I wouldn't go out there if I were you. - Screw you! (door opens) There are men out there, they have guns. - Told you not to go out there, didn't I? - What do we do now? - Are you gonna listen to me? Go upstairs. Go! (loud, dramatic music) (ceiling squeaks) (glass breaks) (glass breaks) - Hey Simon, it's your old buddy Phil! (gunfire) Come on out, just wanna talk. Come here, I need you to do something for me. - What? - This. (gunshots) You're next. - No, no, no, no, no. - You're next. - Okay, okay, okay. - Go. (suspenseful music) (men grunting and scuffling) (men fighting and screaming) (gunshots) (Simon screams) (neck snaps) (panting) - Alright. - Is he... is he... - An asshole, yeah. Come on. (gunshots) (Simon panting) Just go out the way you came in. I won't shoot. - I'm gonna bring Sal your head. He told me he was gonna let his dog hump it. - That ain't happening. - Why not? That dog will fuck anything. - Because I'm not coming down those stairs, and I'm guessing you're not coming up. So this fight's over. - Bullshit, I'm gonna kill you both and then I'm gonna go get a milkshake. Probably strawberry. - Maybe he's right, man. Maybe we should just get out of here. - You fucking pussy. (gunfire) (gunshots) (thudding) - Ew. - Is there anyone else you wanna call? (police sirens wail) (intense chase music) (knocks) - Bad news, boss. They got away. - What about Philly? - Dead. They're all dead. - He was my cousin, you know that? Always knew he was a little goofy in the head, but still. He was family. - What now? - Call Sergeant Harrison, have him put a trace on their phones, he'll find them. And we're gonna raise the bounty. - Who do you want me to send? - Brain Damage. - You serious? - I'm through fucking around, now get to it. (guitar tuning) - Why don't we ever practice? I don't even know any of your songs. - Man, you don't know shit about music. Practice makes you suck. I bet you practice all the time, don't you? - I practice every day. - Fluffy, what do you think about practice? - It makes you suck. - That doesn't make any sense. - Sure it does. You lose the spontaneity necessary for a good live performance. - Shit, I don't even know what the fuck that meant. But it sure sounds like something I don't wanna lose. (phone rings) Hello? (dramatic music) (woman whimpering) Hey, phone call. - Tell them to fuck off. - It's Carmine. - I don't care if it's Akasha, queen of the fucking damned, you tell them to fuck off. - Why don't you fucking tell them? - Fuck off! (woman crying) (phone rings) I said fuck off! (phone rings) (footsteps thudding) What's wrong with her? - She's in love. - You have a phone call. - I don't fucking care! - He said he had a million dollar job offer. (record scratches) - Carmine! Yes, I'm so sorry, I thought it was somebody else. Tell me some more about this job. - Hello? - Eating. - I don't really care, you got a customer here. - Yeah, what do you want? - What do you think I want? I want a room for a night or two. - Yeah? So what is it, a night or two? - Why don't we try one for now? - Alright, that'll be 40 bucks. - Sign outside said 30. - Yeah, well you want clean sheets, don't you? You look like the clean sheet type. - Fine, whatever. - 115. - Anybody ever call you an asshole? - Never, it's the first time. - Yeah, I bet. - And don't give us any problems. - Well, I guess we can take turns sleeping. We'll hide out here for a little while. - For how long? - Until the cops are done with my place, then I've gotta try and go back and get my money. - What do you got? - Five bodies. - Okay, why was I called instead of homicide? - Five of them are mob goons and you're the expert on organized crime. - Who's house is this? The owner is Simon Carson. There's a connection too... A couple years ago his kid was killed in a mob hit gone bad. A month after that, his wife committed suicide. It's a pretty sad story, really. - Any of them him? - No, I guess he was the target. - What else you got on this guy? - Not much, used to work at a bank, quit when his wife and daughter died, and that's pretty much all we know. - Now why would the mob want a banker dead? (tapping) (tapping) - Would you cut it out, please? - I'm bored. We've been here all damn day and you won't even speak to me and the TV's not working. - You know, we were at a nice place with a beautiful TV, and then you called someone. - Sorry. What do you want me to do about it? - Good place to start would be to stop complaining about how bored you are. (sighs) (suspenseful music) - You guys need a room? - Not a room, just a room number. A man and a young girl came in earlier? - Oh yeah, him. They're in 115. You guys going to some kind of a costume party or something? - No, no, we're here to murder them. (Motel Clerk laughs) - You serious? - Oh yes, yes. Most of our weapons are in the car. When we're done here, we're going to go back out to the car, retrieve those weapons, and use them to execute two of your guests. Fluffy? - Wait, wait, wait, wait, I told you what you wanted to know! - True, but you gave up that information without making a deal, you could have used it as a bargaining chip and then maybe we would've let you go. - (stuttering) I've got some other information for you. - Tell me. - If I do, you're gonna let me go, right? - Now you're getting the hang of it. Tell you what, you tell us your glorious new tidbit of information, and if we like it, we'll let you go. - You promise? - I may be a murdering scumbag with a startling array of social diseases, but I am a man of my word. - There are secret cameras hidden all over this parking lot, and I can turn them off for you, I can. - I already knew that. - No, no, no! - What an asshole. (techno music) (chains rattling) - What is all this? What's going on? - These are props, we're making a music video. - Oh, cool. Is there a part in it for me? - Of course there is. Why don't you take this prop dynamite and set it in front of the door to room 115? - Okay. Then what do I do? - Then you light it. - Okay. (water running) - I'm gonna go get a soda or something, you want anything? - No, I'm good. - No, no, no! - Alright, listen to me, get down. - What's going on? - What's going on? Well, let's just say you're not gonna be bored anymore. - I didn't call anybody. - I know you didn't, they probably followed us. Get your head down! - Oh, I am so enjoying this. Where did you find this idiot? - Craigslist. - Now what do I do? - Should we tell him? - Is he any good? - Fuck 'em. - Yeah, fuck 'em. (scream and explosion) - They know we're here. Time to grunk up. - What's that? - Oh, this? This is the hardest of all hard drugs. Around here we call this rusty grunk. - Can I have some? - Fuck no, this shit ain't for you. - Why not, what is it? - Man, this shit is hard as fuck to come by. You see, the military developed this shit so that their soldiers wouldn't mind stomping on babies and puppies and shit. - What does it do? - Man, you see those goldfish over there? We give them just a little bit of this shit, and in no time they'll be chewing through that fucking glass. (screaming, glass breaking) (gunfire) (screaming) (sad piano music) (sad heroic music) - You're bleeding! - Yeah, that blood's coming from the bullet wound you gave me. - I'm sorry! I was trying to help. - You've been saying that a lot lately. Here, we need something to clean and dress the wound and something to get the bullet out. Can you handle that? - Yeah, I think so, but shouldn't you be in the hospital? - No, we can't go to a hospital. Go ahead. (phone rings) - Is this the dead man? - I'm not dead yet. - Oh, give it time, we'll get ya. - Just let it go. - And why should I? - Think about it. You scared the shit out of this kid, you'll never see her again. - What are you, fucking her? - She's 17 years old. - Is that a yes or a no? - Call it off. We'll disappear. - Listen Simon, there's only one way to guarantee I'll never see the both of you again. - You know, it'd be a lot easier for you if you just let this go. - Easier? All I do is hire people to kill you. So tell me, what could be easier than that? - You're not gonna drop this, are you? - Face it Simon, you didn't just fuck up, you betrayed me, and a man in my position cannot afford to let that go. - Okay. Alright, why don't we just see who gets to who first? - Yeah, let's see. - What you doing out here in the middle of the night, old man? - I'm minding my own business. - You here all alone? - Yes, I am. - You got any money? - Yeah, I got lots of cash. - You serious? - Yeah. I got couple of grand right here in this pocket, right here. - Ain't you afraid someone might take it? - Nope. - Why not? - Because I'm so fast. - Fast? Look at you, you a old man. - I may be old, but I'm very fast. - Gimme all your sh... (gunshot) The fuck? - Why don't you just lay down? - Why? - So you don't fall. - Right here? - Yeah. (phone plays Hail to the Chief) Hello? - I'm feeling... I'm feeling dizzy. - Hold on, Carmine. That's good, it means it'll all be over very soon. - Can you please call my mom? I need to tell her something. - I can't do that. I hope you understand. Sorry about that, Carmine. You were saying something about a job? Sure, I'll take that. Yeah. (gunshot) - Let's see what you bought. Okay. This should work. Here, take that. - What? - I need you to take the bullet out. - Who, me? No way, you do it. - I can't do it, it has to be you. - I'll screw it up. You know I'm a screw up. I'll screw everything up. - Take it easy, you can do this. - No, I can't. - You know, if you don't do this, I could die. It's not gonna be that hard, okay? Come on. (Simon groans) Alright, now first thing we need to do is sterilize the... (screams loudly) Fuck! - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I just wasn't ready. Go ahead. Can you feel it? - I think so. - Alright, try and pull it out. (Simon gasps in pain) Oh! - Got it. (panting) - That's good, kid. Alright. You know, I really thought it was gonna be a lot harder than... (Gabby vomits) ...than that. (Gabby vomiting) - It's okay, get it out. Get it all out, it's good. (sirens wail) - Gangbangers? - I thought so, but take a look at the head wound. - What about it? - There's not much in the way of blood. - So? - So, help me turn him. Look where the bullet hit the sidewalk, if you follow it, right there on the pylon. We need to make sure crime scene collects that. - Okay. - I bet you anything that bullet's a perfect match with the slugs we found from a series of killings about two months back inWichita, and again about a year ago in Vegas. - How could you possibly know that? - I've seen this guy's work. Always leaves a distinctive entry wound on the right side of the head, coming out right back here. - Why? - It's his trademark. This guy's name is Harold Knowles, a.k.a. Grassy. - Grassy? Dope dealer? - No, you don't get it, do you? - Get what? - Grassy knolls? He claims he was the second shooter during the Kennedy assassination. You're shitting me, right? - Nope. He's actually quite proud of it. Always leaves his victim with a distinctive wound on the right side of the head, like this one. You know, to remind people. - He would have to be pretty old, wouldn't he? - He is. Just nobody knows how old or even if that's his real name. Okay, so why this kid? - I just don't know. But if I'm right, and he's in town, piles of bodies usually follow. (Simon grunts) - Here, take this and toss it in the canal over there, alright? - Won't we need it? - We're out of bullets, it's just evidence now. Go ahead. (splash) - Simon? - Yeah. - Where are your wife and daughter? - Why do you care? - I don't know. I'm just curious. - I already told you, I don't want to talk about it. - Why not? - Why not, because I don't want to talk about it, isn't that enough? - It's just weird. - Weird, I'll tell you what's weird. They died, okay? They're dead, are you happy now? What are you doing? Where are you going? Gabby, goddamnit! Get back here. We don't have time for this. Come on, get back in the car. - Let go of me! - Why are you so upset? Look, it's not your fault, okay? You didn't know. Can we get back to the car, please? - It's not that. - Then what is it? - I think I have feelings for you! - Feelings? (Simon scoffs) Look at me, I'm a pudgy middle-aged man. How could you possibly have feelings for me? - I don't care about any of that stuff. - Well, you should. At your age, you probably fall in love twice a day. - I can tell the difference! - No you can't! - Yes I can. - And what makes you think that you can? - Because every time someone tries to kill us, I'm more scared for you than I am for me. - Can we just concentrate on staying alive for now? - Don't you think I'm pretty? - Of course I do, you know you're pretty. - Then what makes us so crazy? - Because I'm too old and you're too young, okay? - Age is just a number. That's what some old guy said on the TV. - Look, when you turn 18, if you still feel this way, we'll talk, deal? - Deal. - Okay, can we get back in the... ...car now? (phone rings Hail to the Chief) - Hello? - Our cop just called, looks like Simon's heading home. - Okay. I got it, I'm already here. - My house is right through there. I'm gonna go check it out. - Please don't go. - No choice, we need money. - What if there's somebody waiting there? - There may be, I'm just gonna go check it out. If there's somebody there, I'll just come right back, okay? - Here, take this. It's my lucky medallion. - No thanks, you keep it. (dramatic music) - Hello, Simon. - Shit. - Don't turn around. Where's the girl? - Somewhere safe. - Are we gonna play this game? - No, we don't have to play that game. We can play another game I know, it's called hide and go fuck yourself. - You shouldn't antagonize me. - Or what, you'll shoot me? You're gonna shoot me anyway. - You should be proud. You're my last job. The last job in a long and distinguished career. - Distinguished. - Hey, you're standing in the presence of history, pal. I assassinated a President. What have you done? - We all know how this ends up, so just go ahead. - Well, you know where the girl is, and I need that information to complete the job. - I'm not telling you anything. (Knowles grunts and rattles) I didn't come all this way to just give that kid to someone like you. (Knowles grunting) You've gotta be kidding me. - Pills... pocket... pocket... - That what you're looking for? This? That's for JFK. (gurgles) (leaves rustling) - Was there anybody there? - Nah, nobody was there. - What's in the bag? - Have a look for yourself. - Is this all real? - Yes, it is. - How much is it? - I don't know, never really counted it. I've also got this. - Where's my gun? - I only have one. - One gun? What kind of hit man are you? - I'm the kind of hit man that only has one gun. Let's go. - Well, maybe I should hold onto it. - Yeah, that's a good idea. We'll give you the gun, you can shoot me again, put me out of my misery. (phone rings) - Yo. - Grassy's dead. - Of course he is. What happened? - Natural causes, I think. - Natural causes? - Yeah. - You're saying he just fucking up and died? - That's what it looked like. - This guy's becoming a royal fucking pain in my ass. What do I gotta do to kill him? - I know a guy. - Yeah, tell me about him. - He's kind of a simpleton. I mean, really dumb. A jackass. This guy's so stupid, bullets don't seem to phase him. - You saying he's bulletproof? - Yeah, I guess that's what I'm saying. At least he doesn't mind getting shot so much as a normal person would. (laughs) - Alright, fuck it, call him. - TV! Please work, please work, please work. Yes! (TV channels changing) Oh TV, I've missed you. - You hungry? - Very, can you order a pizza or something? (light, childish music) - What are you doing playing on your phone? You were so excited about the TV. - Eh, there's nothing on. (door knocking) - Room service! - We didn't order anything. - It's your complimentary free champagne. - That's okay, we don't want it. - I want it. - But it's free. - You already said that, and I said no. - 'Kay, I'll just leave it here by the door, in case you want it later, okay? - The hell's going on? (busy signal) - What's wrong? - How do they keep finding us? - Huh? (crash) (punch thuds) - Simon! (giggles) (Gabby screams) (punch thuds) (giggles) (sniffles) (grunting and eating noises) (gunshot) (gunshots) - Hey kid, are you alright? Kid, wake up. (Gabby groans) - What happened? - Well, near as I can tell, somebody broke into our room to steal our pizza. - You made a joke. - Yeah, I guess I did. - Does that mean you're my friend now? - Let's just say I'm getting used to you. - You're bleeding. - Yeah, I guess I'm getting used to that, too. We gotta get out of here. Don't forget your... ...your phone! Son of a bitch. - What? - The phones! - I didn't call anybody. - No, I know you didn't. You didn't have to. All this time they've been tracking us with the phones. That's how they've shown up everywhere we've ever gone. - Should I chuck it? - No, I don't think you have to. I think if you just turn it off we'll be okay. Good news is we're about to become invisible to them. - Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! You said this guy was good! You said he was fucking bulletproof! Those were your fucking words, yes? - I'm sorry, boss. - Sorry, I am fucking sick to death of sorry. Everything with you is a fucking sorry. You find him. You do it now, you handle it yourself or you are a dead man, you got me? - They turned the phones off. - Say that again. - They must've figured us out. (smack) - Fuck you and your excuses. I don't give a shit, handle it. Now get the fuck out of here and don't come back until you've got something for me. (sniffles) - It's okay, we're safe here. - I'm tired of being scared. - Yeah, me too, but Sal doesn't know about this place, so we should be okay here. - What are you, rich or something? - I guess you could say that. My wife was pretty well off, she came from money. (tense music) (piano keys thud) - How adorable do I look? - Where'd you get that? - I found it in there. Isn't it cute? - Just do me a favor, take it off, okay? - No, I look like Sunny Miss Daisy. (Simon sighs) - Just take it off, please. - Why? - Give me the goddamn hat. - Calm down. - Fuck. - It's just a hat. (solemn music) (waves crashing) - I'm really sorry about that. Sometimes it's really hard for me to think about them, you know what I mean? - It's okay, I understand. - Some mornings when I wake up I believe she's still there next to me. It feels so real. I can almost hear her breathing. I imagine my little girl comes running in, she jumps on the bed. I try and hold that moment, you know? I squeeze my eyes real tight. But it never lasts. - Do you think you'll see them again someday? - Sometimes. - So what do we do next? - We've gotta bring this fight to Sal, take him out. - Kill him? - Yeah, we're never gonna be safe as long as that man's alive. - You can't do that. - Sure I can. I mean, it's not gonna be easy, but... - No, I mean I don't want you to. - Why the hell not? Don't tell me you still have a crush on him? - Crush? You have the wrong idea. - Come on kid, I know what you two were doing. - Ew, you think we were lovers? - Yeah, I mean, it's not something to be embarrassed about, everybody does it. - It is when it's your father. - Sal's your father? - Sal's my father. - Wait a second, I met his wife and his kids. I didn't see you there. - You met his real family. - Your mother was his mistress. - She died a couple of months ago. Before she died, she told me who my dad was. That I should get in contact with him. That he would take care of me. - Instead he sent me. Come here, come on. (Gabby sobbing) - What kind of man would do that to his daughter? - It's okay, I'm gonna take care of you now. But the first thing we have to do is get rid of Sal, okay? - Okay. - Alright, come here, come here. (Gabby sobbing) This isn't right. - It feels right to me! - You're scared, you're confused, you have no idea what you want right now. - I want you! - I'm more than twice your age. - I don't care, I love you! You told me I'm pretty. - You are pretty. You are very pretty, that's not what this is about. You know how easy it would be for me to just let this happen? - I'm gonna die a virgin. - You're not gonna die a virgin. - Well, there's only one way to make sure of that. - Gabby, I'm not gonna sleep with you, okay? - I meant get rid of Sal. You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you? So what's the plan? - First thing in the morning I'm gonna plant the phones. They'll tell him where the phones are. He'll send his men. Soon as I see he's unguarded, I'll move in, and I'll take him out. (climactic music) - Hey, put it down. I said put it down! (stomping) (muffled scream) (phone rings) - Yo, talk to me. - Hey boss, I found the phones, but there's nobody here. - Simon is here. Get the fuck out there and find him. (gunshots) Okay, you got me, Simon. Tell me, what's it gonna take? - You wouldn't let it go. - That was then, this is now. Just name your fucking price and we'll meet it. What do you want, Simon? You want a fuck-load of cash? I'll give you more than you can carry. - You're not talking your way out of this, pal. - Simon, we can come to an agreement, here. We're not so different. - Not so different? Are you kidding me? You're trying to kill your own daughter, I'd do anything to bring mine back. - So fucking take her. Have her, enjoy her. You have my blessing. - You remember a phone conversation we had where you said there was only one way to make sure you never saw us again? - I do. - Yeah, we'll so do I. (gunshots) (Sal screams) You know, I used to think that what I was doing was right, that I was avenging my daughter's death, but now I know that nobody that's on your side can be right. - Move away, Simon. - No fucking way. - If I wanted to shoot you, you'd be dead already. Now back off of him. - The fuck are you waiting for, shoot this cocksucker. Fucking kill him! - I didn't come here to save you. I came here to kill you. I'm the boss now. (gunshots) It's a nice trick you pulled there. Created an opportunity for me, and I'm grateful. - So what now? - You can go. I don't have a problem with you or the skirt. - Then it's over. - Let's say it's over as far as I'm concerned. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - Sal called someone. - Who? - A sane man would've never called this guy, but Sal was out of his mind pissed. He called The Spook. - And who the hell is that? - Ex-CIA assassin, used to offing world leaders and shit. For this guy, killing someone like you is like a stop at the ice cream shop. - Okay, call it off. - If I could, I would, but this guy goes off the grid until the job is done. - There's gotta be some way to reach him. - He'll call me when you two are... Well, when he's finished. He's gonna be looking for his money. No offense, but I'm gonna pay him. - Can you at least tell me what he looks like? (Carmine scoffs) - Like I know. Nobody knows what he looks like. (horror music) - Good morning, sleepyhead. Before I remove the tape, I'm gonna tell you what's in this needle. There's a scientific name for it, but truthfully, I'm not even gonna try and pronounce it. You can call it go to sleep forever juice. If I stick you with this, you'll be dead before you even feel the prick. No pun intended. Now I'm gonna remove the tape from your mouth, but if you so much as whimper, I will stick you. You understand? - Why are you doing this? - Because government pay is for shit. Nothing personal, I need the money. - If you hurt me, Simon's gonna get you. - Oh, Simon. Where is he? - I don't know, I haven't seen him in a while. - You don't have to tell me. I know where he's gonna be. (frantic music) (quiet, tense music) (stairs creak) - Simon, watch out! - Hey asshole, why did you come here? This was the first place I looked. Seems sadly ironic, doesn't it? All the women in your life are dying. You are bad luck. - Kid, are you okay? - I guess so. - I'm gonna get you out of this, don't you worry. - I'm really, really scared! - I know, baby, I know. I'm gonna figure it out, okay? - That's enough! - If you hurt her, I'm gonna kill you. - Don't threaten me, dipshit. - Just let her go, we'll leave. You'll never see us again. - Blow me. God, I always wanted to say that. If I was a man, I would say that all the time. - Sal's dead. - Really? Congratulations, I don't care. - If there's no Sal, there's no contract. You can just let us go. - And miss out on all this fun? Besides, they'll pay it. - They might. Why take the chance? - I'm listening. - How much they paying you? - That's a bit of a personal question, isn't it? - Stop fucking around. How much are they paying you? - My, aren't we testy? They're paying me a mil. - I can cover that. - Impressive, I'll have to think about it. - What's there to think about? You can have your money and everybody walks. - Okay, where is the money? - When the girl is safe. - I give you the girl, I have nothing. You have to do better than that. - And if I give you the money, I've got nothing. - Wake up, shithead. You have nothing now. I have all the cards, the whole fucking deck, now tell me where the money is or I will put her to sleep. - Okay, I'll tell you. - Where is the money? - It's on the dresser, the red bag. - You're kidding. Holy shit. You've been a busy little murderer, haven't you? You little bitch! - Simon! (gunshots) No! (Gabby sobbing) Simon! Please don't be dead, please don't be dead. (coughs and gurgles) Are you okay? - What happened? - I took care of it. We're gonna be okay. - Gabriela, I'm Detective Shaw, do you mind if I ask you some questions? - What kind of questions? - The easy kind. What's in the bag? - Lady stuff. - Lady stuff? - I can be more descriptive if you want. - Nah, that's okay. Why don't you tell me about what happened instead? - Sal tried to kill me, Simon saved me. He sacrificed everything for someone he didn't even know. - How did you come to meet him? - I don't wanna talk anymore. - I'd like to learn more about what happened. - What's the day today? - The 22nd, why? - It's my birthday tomorrow, I turn 18. - That's great, honey. Now can you tell me about the first time you saw Simon? - No, I think I'd like to talk to a lawyer first. - You haven't even been charged with a crime. - I haven't been charged with anything? - No, of course not. - What about Simon? - When he comes out of surgery, if he survives, I've got questions for him, too. All I have right now is self-defense. - Then I don't wanna talk anymore. - Okay. Call me if you need anything from me. (solemn music) It looks like your boyfriend's gonna make it. - He's not my boyfriend.
