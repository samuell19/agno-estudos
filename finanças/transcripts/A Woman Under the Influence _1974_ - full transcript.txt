I- I always understood you, and you always understood me... and that was always just... how it was, and that's it. "Till death do us part," Nick. You said it. Remember? He said, "Do you, Mabel Mortensen, take this man?" "I do." "I do", Nick. "I do." Remember, I said... "It's gonna work because I'm already pregnant. " Don't let that mind run away on you now. Remember how you laughed? - Don't, Mabel. - Nick. You laughed. - Don't. - Don't you remember? And he was mad as a big toad. Don't do that. Hey, don't be sad. I know you love me. - Hey. - We had plenty of time to find that out, didn't we? You and I know. You see that, Nick? That's how close we are. And they can't pull us apart. They can't force us apart. 'Cause... we're together. I don't know who you are. Don't say that, honey. I'm not sore at you. I'm not mad or anything. Mabel... don't. You sit there and pretend you- All of that doesn't mean- And you know. You know. It's us. - You're going with them out there on the outside. - Be still. - And we're supposed to be on the inside.

Well, you said you were upset. Did you and Nick have a fight? Nick, I get - I get the idea there's... some kind of a conspiracy going on here. I mean, you've been looking at me so quiet-like and, uh - - He's got something in that bag. - Don't be concerned about this bag.
