[Haunting vocal music] (Edgar) I don't leave my house much these days. I prefer to stay in my study. I work my mind, doing my best to unravel the mysteries. Actually, it's not really my house. I draw from my subconscious without shame. [Chimes and rumbling tones] Ah. Most human contact seems trivial to me, unconvincing, overly sentimental, especially male contact with women. I'm searching for the purest kind of love in the opposite sex and the purest kind of sex in love. Where are you going, Chloe? Where have you been, Edgar, making love with your fantasies? You don't think I love you? You only love ideas. You're a mental masturbator, a diamond with a great big flaw. And I know. I'm a jeweler. I didn't mean that. (Edgar) What part of love belongs to sexuality? Sex is the last great unexplored human mystery. [Woman moaning] Lose yourself trees, rocks... Faster. What are you talking about? Cherry pie. Faster. Oh! Is there another guy? Oh, faster! Oh. Is there another guy? [Knock at door] (Woman) Zoe. Is that him? Just ignore it. Is that the guy? Faster! Telephone for you. It's a man. Oh. What's his name? What's his name? I don't know. Hello? Yes. Today? You mean this afternoon? Yes, I know where that is, near the university. What? No, I'm not married. Who was that, Zoe? Him? I have to work later. I need to sleep well, you just lost the best thing that you ever had. And I'm never coming back. Bye-bye. [Mournful string music] Working the faldo house? I'm sorry? Are you working at the faldo house? Yes. Listed with the agency? Yes. That's funny. The client didn't say there'd be somebody else. Did he say what the subject 1s? A discussion between several men is all I heard. I hope they're doctors or professors. Is that what you're used to, doctors and professors? Used to? How fast are you? How fast? Oh, 130 shorthand, you win. Yes. Go ahead. Oh, excuse me. What is this? We're the stenographers. Oh, no, no, no. This is horrific. You're very rude. I'm Oscar, and I'm leaving. This is very disconcerting. I'm convinced, somehow, that you would've stimulated me into saying something entirely unforgettable. I'm sure you'll remember it. I think you're right. Oh, excuse me, I... Thank you... For being punctual. Come in. Everyone's assembled. Alice? Zoe? I'm Zoe. Alice. Alice. Wait to be invited. Alice. Zoe. (Sevy) If narcissus stays in the garden, there will be chaos. There'll be no more peace, no escape... (Edgar) Alice, Zoe, come here. Hysteria. Hysteria. Monty and Peter. Monty's a German novelist; Peter, a former student of mine. And if the thermometer breaks, there'll be Mercury. And sevy is a painter from London. Memorize their names, please. What are they doing? Ah, automatic writing, direct messages from the subconscious. It's one of our favorite experiments. We're not transcribing that kind of stuff, are we? It's hard enough when people are awake. I agree, exactly. So you are a professor. (Sevy) No escape. No solution. And that day down by the riverbank, below the surface, there was so many horses went by. What happened? Was I any good? Decadent. Let me guess. Alice. Zoe. She knows what she wants. And it isn't you. I'm not looking, or I'd prove you wrong. A man is always looking. Careful. So, sevy, do you paint that one upside down? My hand has wings. It works by itself. [Moaning] The muse of automatic writing. What's a muse? Very good question. I like her hair and her little skirt. I'm glad you approve. Our investigation will begin momentarily. What is this? Your uniform. I'm sorry. We're wearing uniforms? The search for objective truth requires certain sacrifices. But there was no mention of a uniform. Feel free to leave. No, that's fine. I wonder if we get to keep them. What do you suppose he meant by "certain sacrifices"? Don't worry. I think you're right. They're doctors or professors or something. He said "investigation." I hope they don't use too many technical terms. Alice? Mm-hmm? Can you really do 1307? Yes. I'm only able to do 64, so mathematically, I think you should take three of the men, and I'll take one, Peter. All right, that's fine. Take your seats. Alice. I want this on the record, please. You're helping me write a groundbreaking study. This group project marks the first time that our subject's been researched by men other than individual doctors or psychoanalysts. The university, as well as society, would frown upon these undertakings, so we should keep our sessions secret until published. Would you switch seats, please? Sit here. I've chosen each of you because we're closely acquainted and presumably can be open with one another. But we'll need rules, guidelines, if you like. Uh, Peter, you're here to probe your most intimate relations, discarding all romantic notions. Excuse me. No jokes or slang. Take a clinical approach and stick to the concrete. Oh, and never include the stenographers in our discussions. They're here merely to record our words and stimulate certain intangibles. [Coughs] Excuse me. For the record, I'd like to thank our host and loyal patron, faldo, who might join us later. So shall we begin? A man and a woman make love. To what extent is the man aware of the woman's orgasm? [Pencil snaps] Sevy. Hardly at all. Any objective ways of telling? Mystery to me. Why? How can a man be objective about a woman's climax? You can't, Edgar. No, not really. I only have subjective ways of telling. Subjective ways? Which I trust to the extent that I trust the woman involved. And how much does Edgar trust a woman? To the extent that I love her, monty. That much? [Moaning] (Edgar) Peter... Peter? What? How is a woman aware of a man's orgasm? I guess when she notices a change in his posture. A subjective and useless answer. (Peter) Oh, right, so it's okay for you to be subjective but not me? The woman can find out for herself by examining the man. Okay, I've thought about it, and now I have an answer. And? A man is the best judge of a man's orgasm. And a woman? A woman is the best jury. [Laughter] No jokes, I said. Sevy, what do you think of onanism? Is it something sad? Does it imply the lack... (Whispering) Zoe, what did he say? (Sevy) Exactly the opposite. An abundance. And always accompanied by images of women. (Sevy) Or giraffes, possibly, sheep... Puppies. Animals? I'm not discussing that. Ditto. What? Afraid of what you might find? Onanism has to be accompanied by images of women. There's nothing sad about it. It's a legitimate compensation for some of life's sadnesses. (Monty) As legitimate as homosexuality? They've nothing in common, and we're not discussing homosexuality. Why not? If two guys love each other, let them do it. No, no, no. (Sevy) I can accept it, but I have no interest in it. Although I can imagine the idea of going to bed with a young man I found particularly attractive. The heterosexual male point of view means exactly that. I insist that this remain as consistent as possible. (Peter) Edgar, do you often experience nightly sexual episodes caused by female fiends? Fiends, Peter? You mean the succubus... [Gasps] The female creature that haunts life's other side... Excuse me, I... The side that we experience with our eyes shut. She's generally described as physically repulsive yet strangely beautiful. No man can resist her advances. (Peter) This kind of sex can't possibly be as good as with a real woman. Oh, much better. I was asking Edgar. Much better, sevy? Lack of control, surrender... Very enticing. Very, very enticing. [Horn honking] A monster of the mind is better than a real woman? Only a pervert would think that. Or a dreamer. Or a dreamer. (Edgar) This must be faldo. One moment, please. Ladies. [Chuckles] Erotic art from Europe... Sasha and I bought it. Shipping it all here. We can't have the servants drooling over it up at our estate in Montreal, can we? No, no, you can't. No. Dark rumors on wall street. Got to leave for Manhattan immediately. Dire predictions, Edgar. Plunging stocks, falling brokers... Dark rumblings. It's thrilling times for us speculators, huh? Christ, who redecorated, hieronymus bosch? Who? Did you do this, zezzy? Sevy, and no. Edgar, you didn't tell me you had company. We've begun the investigation for my manifesto, thanks to your generosity. [Faldo chuckles] My generosity? Is that what you thinkiit is, is generosity? It's guilt, Edgar, guilt. Guilt. Say, uh, fellas, would you remove some of this junk off the mantle so we can get this painting up there? Thank you. Yes, my family made its money in real estate, made a killing. And real estate is a broad foundation of most guilt. So that's why I make my killing in the arts. Oh, you kill artists? No. No, no. Not exactly. I just give them loaded weapons to, uh, play with. Then if they happen to expire in the process, well, it just raises their value. Artists are like... Wanted criminals, wild animals, trophies. They're worth more dead than they are alive. Sometimes I feel like a criminal animal, Billy the kid gloves. (Edgar) Gentlemen, this is faldo, a genuine patron of the arts. You know sevy. This is Peter. Oh. Sir, I think your painting is marvelous. I'm a novelist from Germany. I work in sports. I'm Zoe. She's Alice. [Chuckles] Hello, ladies. Oh. (Faldo) Hello, Zoe. Hello, Alice. So... What subject you investing in? Investigating, faldo. Sex. Beg your pardon? For my book, the one I wrote you about, researches into male sexuality. What are the ladies doing here if it's male sexuality? They're missing the vital organ, Edgar. [Chuckles] We're muses. Muses. Oh, muses. You know, Edgar, I always suspected you got canned from the university for fooling around with young coeds. Now I'm sure of it. I've never fooled around. Each time, I was quite serious. (Faldo) You've always been quite serious. Nothing much has changed. Well, please, please, please, continue your inspection or your interrogation or whatever you're calling it. I'm just gonna admire my painting before I go. It's just... It's beautiful, isn't it? She's beautiful. Yes. Can I give you my card? No, no, no. Thank you, sir. Zezzx... sevy. Are you still painting these little wormlike figures? Don't you think you ought to change your style, grow? Sevy! Gentlemen, should we continue? Monty, please be seated. Monty, please. [Grunting] Edgar. What? Is a woman's orgasm more intense than a man's? More evanescent. Evanescent? Jesus, Edgar, you use words like that in the book, and nobody's gonna understand you. How do you know something like that? I don't know that, and I've got more experience than all of you put together. Join us, faldo. You might find it therapeutic. (Faldo) Oh, no, no, no. I get my kicks in the market with the bulls and the bears. Unfortunately, we've excluded bestiality as a topic. Oh, well, don't mind me. A man is more violent... Than a woman... And so is his orgasm. (Peter) I've heard that a woman's can be deeper and longer. Sounds like you boys really know your stufe listen to this, Mr. faldo. Sevy, when you're with a woman, what is your favorite place to caress? (Sevy) Well, I like to do everything possible with the anus. Oh, Jesus! What's wrong with you? Zezzx... sevy. All right, sevy. You do love women, don't you? Yes, of course. Well, how do you figure your taste for buggery? Taste for buggery? Sodomy with a woman is a delicacy... [Hiccups] Oh, so appealing. Well, I... [Chuckles] Well, if you ask me, you buy into buggery, the bottom drops out. [Laughter] Ha-ha. Well, I'm sorry to leave this naughty little sewing circle, but I... So you won't participate? Mr. faldo? Do you think you could learn anything from this? Oh, no, no, no. I doubt it, no. How can you be so sure? Because my women are satisfied already. [Alice hiccups] Every one, every time, guaranteed. [Sighs] How do you know that? I know what females like. What do females like? Well, they... They like, uh, a man who knows what he's doing. And they like him to go slow, not to rush things. But most important, gentlemen, they like him to know about the little man in the boat. You mean the c-c-c... Clitoris? You always know where it is? [Chuckling] What are you really doing in there, Edgar? I explained it all in my letter. You sent word that you approved. I never read mail unless I can cash it. We're doing research. Research? On who, those two dollies? I don't want to leave the subject of sex only to Freud and his cohorts. My goal is an absolute reality in the interpretation of one's own thoughts. You're right, Edgar, right. This penis envy and wanting to have sex with your mother, it's ridiculous. But the important thing is, who's your audience for the book? Every intelligent man interested in the mystery of sex. Oh, you think intelligence has something to do with sex, huh? Well, pictures... Are you gonna have pictures, photos? Well, maybe Oscar will do some. Oh, that's good. That's good, because sex sells. And if it's any good, we'll publish it at faldo press. Oh. And I'll give you 1/2 of 1%... Net. I'm overwhelmed. Keep an eye out for those paintings. They'll look good in the book. Let's go. Yes, sir. (Alice) I will never subject myself to such perversion again. Who are you kidding? You liked it. No, they're lewd and disgusting. See, you were interested. No, I wasn't. I'm a professional; I do my job. But not here. This whole place makes me uncomfortable. And that man who owns the house, faldo, he's a bully. Very naughty. Ah. Chloe told me what happened, Edgar, that she's moved out. Makes her available to come back to me. Wasn't she always? Did you tell him you want Chloe back? He knows. He's worried, insanely jealous. I wonder if our girls undress for him or give him kisses. I'd hate that. Excellent. Very good material. Next session is Thursday at 4:00. Yes. I'll make sure there are no interruptions. (Zoe) Alice, you're blushing. No, I'm not. It's just hot in here. Why did we get into this in the first place? Faldo. Exactly. Plus, look at the girls. It's worth it. They're so delicious. So Alice? I told you, I'm not interested in anyone but Chloe, okay? I'm meeting her right now. Fine, I'd take Zoe too. Monty, do you know where the clitoris is? The clitoris? Who cares? Oh. Academics. Like to have a cup of tea with me, Zoe? Can't. Roger gets angry when I'm late. He'll never leave me, though, no matter what I put him through. He's predictable, really. But like they were saying today, you just have to keep trying new ways, right? Oh, I suppose... yes, yes. If you can't do it, you might as well hear about doing it until you can do it. What do you mean? I'm just glad you're coming back. Yes, well, e-each young man appears to be very frank and... and, well... Sexy? No, desperate, actually. I'll see you next week. It's been swell. (Chloe) Obsession about sex, because you don't know anything about sex. I know just as much as Edgar about sex, don't 1? (Chloe) No, you know, but it's fine. You know, it's just that... It's a misunderstanding. You think he's better than me? Aren't I as good as him? Do you prefer being in bed with him? It was your first time, and I was barely conscious. What do you expect? You weren't that drunk. [Gasps] So you like peeping as much as transcribing. You are a strange bird. What are you doing? Your lips, they really quiver. Maybe your lips need to be kissed. Yours ought to be sealed. I won't tell anyone you were watching. What? (Peter) I'm not a virgin! (Chloe) Shut up! You're mad! I'm not a virgin! You're embarrassing me. I'm not a virgin! [Whimpering] You're not going there. No, no, no, please. Please, please, I'm so sorry. Kiss me, kiss me. Why not come out of your cage, little bird? Just promise me you won't... Marry me; Marry me. Are you crazy? Okay, we're going to get arrested. Okay, now... [Water dripping] (Edgar) This session will take place in this room today. Gentlemen, lend a hand, please. I hope the rain doesn't cause too much of a distraction. Pity that Oscar and I missed the first session. The subject is far from exhausted, lorenz. What? There you go. "A man and a woman make love. "How often can they arrive at orgasm simultaneously?" Your shorthand is quite lovely, Alice. "And is such simultaneity desirable?" Or even necessary, I could add. What do you think, Oscar? Desirable, indispensable, commendable, if not necessary. Well, how frequently for you? 75%. You and a woman climax in unison 75% of the time? Couldn't be. It'd have to be 80%. Well, I have neither the mental nor the physical capacity to delay my own orgasm, which makes it impossible to discuss percentages. Perhaps 1%. Making love with a woman: Is a game whose object is to arrive at orgasm together. [Laughs] Gentlemen. Yeah, we're finished in that room. We're gonna patch in here now. We're conducting a very serious discussion in this room. (Man ♪1) We don't patch that ceiling, y'all going to be swimming. We ain't going to bother nobody. (Man ♪2) Nobody. Well, if you insist. [Hammer pounding] Ah. To what extent is the man's erection necessary in the accomplishment of the sexual act? [Hammering stops] Oh, thank you. Lorenz? (Lorenz) I've never experienced anything but a semi-erection. Do you regret that? (Lorenz) I don't regret it any more than being unable to lift pianos or walk on water. [Hammering resumes] When making love, a third person, is this a hindrance? I think another woman might be welcome. (Sevy) A voyeur might be nice. I'd even like to be one myself. You'd like to watch, sevy? Yes. If they were both very beautiful, yes. What if it was your wife you were watching? Oh, I only find her beautiful in the dark. Is she that ugly? No. Edgar, what's your position on themenage a trois? I do not like the presence of a third person. (Lorenz) I believe that love is made by two people in different kinds of solitude. Mm, zombies. (Man ♪1) Can't you people go to another room? (Man ♪2) We got some work to do. Yeah, we got work to do. (Sevy) Edgar, what do you think about having sex with one woman whilst you're in love with another? When I love a woman, I don't look at others. Bollocks. Do you even know what it means to love a woman, Peter? (Peter) You can't define a mystery like that at the drop of a hat. Monty? I've never fallen in love. I've had to settle for making it. (Sevy) I know when I'm in love, when my hand would rather caress crevices than canvases. Curious. No one here can say what it means to love a woman. It's to see her as the unique preoccupation of one's life... I'm sorry. A preoccupation above all others. (Oscar) Or an invitation to mutual exploration seized during moments of visual emotional contact accompanied by the removal of any artificiality... [sevy whistles] That sounds to me like you're describing photography. And sometimes accompanied by a flash of light. What if she's faking? Who's faking? The woman you're with. I don't trust women, but it's like poker. I don't care if they cheat as long as I win. (Peter) If a woman is pretending in order to give a man satisfaction, well, that's not cheating in my book. And you, Edgar? The day I stop trusting a woman, I stop loving her. (Lorenz) There's nothing that can be said about physical love until we can start from the fact that men and women have equal rights in it. Has anyone here claimed otherwise, lorenz? Everything I've heard so far seems to be dominated by this male point of view. Left to themselves, men tend to suffer from gross myopia. Bollocks. You must continue to grace these sessions. (Zoe) Oscar's the one. When he looks at me, I get so nervous. I can't even flirt properly. Have you noticed monty's legs? He'd be the bee's knees standing up. Don't be vulgar, Zoe. I've seen the way he looks at you. Tell me you haven't thought about his legs wrapped around you like... If I think of monty at all, it's only in a professional manner. Oh, come here, my littlefraulein. Zoe. Monty, monty! Zoe, please. [Gasps] I like the way Edgar fights off his challengers. His dedication is heroic. He's just freeloading off faldo. He hasn't even got a job. I heard it's true, you know. He was kicked out of the university for having several affairs. Apparently, he brought up sex right there in literature class. Well, he's an idealist. I'm sure he's not completely comfortable with people. He's got secrets he'd never share with any woman. Excuse me. There's a small bonus for the added participants. Hope it wasn't too painful on your fingers. Her fingers can take a lot more than that. Until tomorrow at noon. Thank you. By the way, you two are invited to a screening of Oscar's new films at the library tonight on the back stairway. I'll just, uh, make a note. [Camera clicks] You're beautiful. That was better than sex. [Paper tears] The fantastic in reality is the whole reality. Oh, yes, it is. [Projector clicking] [Meandering clarinet music] What is it? Oh. [Cheers and applause] Play it again. (Peter) Play it again. Show it again! Show it again! I will not play it again. Boo. Why not? Because I have another one to show you first. Hooray! Oscar, my wife thought your film better than fudge sundae, didn't you, Janet? Yes, it was like Chestnut cream. Chestnut cream? Yes, images like this you have to force people to swallow. Yes, she really got it, didn't she? My dear, you've gotten more than I could've ever hoped. Excuse me. Oscar, another triumph. And where is faldo? I need him to like it, Edgar, especially the next one and the one I haven't made yet. They'll be here soon. And don't worry. I'll tell him how much he enjoyed it. Yes, how much he enjoyed it and how little... How little he spent on it. It cost him. Smashing, Edgar. (Sevy) Very, very good. This is Janet. Yes, hello. You were exquisite. How about me? Who are you? Oh, butcher. Funny. Very funny. Oh, sevy. You can't face your true feelings, Chloe. Edgar... what? I mean, Peter... You see, you're confusing me again. I face my feelings all the time, all right? I just... Can we just forget about this and remember when things were good? I don't know how you can be so nostalgic when you're so willing to forget everything. Did you call me Edgar? No. Edgar, I wanted to ask about your stenographers, Alice in particular. No, they're not our subjects. No, not directly, but... Come. I'll have you know that I spent the rest of my day with the lovely scent of Alice upon my hand. And I tell you, it allowed me to masturbate in a way I haven't masturbated for years. I mean, I should've been arrested for how I abused myself then you're disqualified from any further participation. Oh, nonsense. You tell me you haven't had similar thoughts concerning this girl. (Edgar) You can't distort this work with your personal obsessions, lorenz. (Lorenz) Isn't that exactly what you're doing? And besides, I tend to see sexuality as personal. It's what part of love belongs to sexuality. I see. So you're saying you won't venture into Alice's little wonderland until you're madly in love with her? [Chuckles] Excellent, Oscar. Thank you, my friend. My dear, are you attracted to negros”? Oh, thank you. She's delightful. Enjoying yourselves? Yes, thank you. I find modesty in a woman to be very attractive. Was that a compliment? You two, you have all the drama of a coitus interruptus. Go away, monty. Look, if you're having troubles, just blame it all on Edgar. I'll even do it for you. Edgar, come here for a second. I've got to talk to you. Monty. Monty. Edgar! [Groans] It's going to be fun, I promise. (Sevy) Hello, monty. This is Janet. We're married. Nice to meet you, Janet. Hello. Oh, no. (Janet) Did you enjoy the film? I haven't seen it. I was on the loo. Oh. Listen, Edgar, we've been talking about what lorenz said today, that we need a female perspective in our discussions. No, bad idea. It's a good idea. I volunteer Janet. She said she'd like to join. No, I never said that, sevy. Didn't you? I'd be too intimidated. Don't be shy. We keep it small, no strangers. No, I'm not shy. No, she's not shy. Timid, perhaps, but definitely not shy. I'm not timid either. But as a woman, I might confuse sex with love. Edgar's doing that already. So what do you think, Edgar? Should we invite this lovely creature to join us? I think you should drop the matter. He's right. I'd feel so inferior. Janet? Intellectually speaking. Don't worry about that. (Monty) Some people may have better sex than others, but they aren't any experts. Right, Edgar? I think anyone could be an expert on the subject of sex, sharp as a diamond. Yet is a single flaw enough to discount the value completely? That make you feel like a big man? I'm not good with people, Peter. That was a totally inappropriate thing to say. Then he shouldn't have asked. Maybe I should ask you to step outside. You want to go look at the stars? [Grunts] You have the most beautiful eyes in the world. [Laughing] It was stupid. Good evening, faldo. Sasha, how are you? Edgar. Oh, yeah, it was tedious, darling. You should have been there. Blood in the gutters out there, Edgar. (Edgar) Blood in the gutters. Dark rumblings. May I take that for you? There we go. Whew! [Laughs] There's just been a slight delay on those... (Faldo) These boys... Are investigating the dark continent of sex. Oh, that's my favorite subject. The heterosexual male point of view. It was my first lesson in school. (Edgar) But we're conducting the investigation, bit of a clinical setting. Clinical? Edgar, you taken up gynecology? I'm going to go see about Oscar's sprockets. I'll be... Take your coat off. (Joey) Everybody be quiet, please. I think the maestro wants to say a couple of words. Oh, Joey. Um, yes, um... Give me your hand. (Oscar) My next film... Oscar. Lights. Oh. [Faldo and Sasha groaning] [Mysterious vocal music] Zoe? Hm? How many men have you known all together? I've lost count. Really? (Man) Excuse us. I wonder if that's the speakeasy. The laundry? Would you like to go in? They know me. No! I mean, I don't even drink. Of course not, silly. It's illegal. Alice? I'm sorry? What's the first thing you look at when you look at a man? The eyes? Oh, yes, his eyes, yes. Mm-hmm, their eyes. Do you ever look at their behind, just when they're walking? Why did you become a stenographer? Why do you think? To be a writer? Not exactly. Oh, well, that's what happened to me. But the more I started transcribing other people's stories, the more I realized I didn't have any of my own, so... I did it to meet boys. Oh. Mm-hmm. Boys are the reason why I've done most things. I haven't lost count. I'm sorry? Of men. There's only been three. And enough sex for 33. Really? I love it, and I'm not embarrassed just because I'm a girl. Zoe? Hm? You've had three more men than I've had. I thought so. You're very lucky. Lucky? I feel like a fool most of the time. I'm a freak, an outcast. I'm a virgin, Zoe. They're giving you an education, and they're paying you for it. Yes, well, I certainly hope I graduate one day. Where you been? Where have you been? Roger. Where you been? Contemplating the mysteries of raw meat. I knew it. What? You're picturing someone else. Mm, commendable, recommendable, if not necessary. Making love to you is just a game. A game whose object it is to reach orgasm together. Love means a man and woman wanting to settle down, have children, and grow old together. When they do sex, they do it as Adam and Eve did it, straight, simple, safe. Someone made you sick, Zoe, filled your head with twisted ideas. You had a good thing, and you lost it. (Edgar) Peter. Thank you. We're ready to begin. Peter. Zoe, I like your hair and your blouse. Thank you. Sevy. Pants. Sevy, be seated. Who said you could wear pants? You look so lovely. Danke. Bitte. You look lovely too. But, then, you always do. You're wearing lipstick. It's nice. Thank you. (Edgar) Ready to begin. First question: Gentlemen, describe your first time. How old were you, and where was your mother at the time? Oh, shit. Sasha, good afternoon. Good? What's good about it? Edgar, sit down. Gossip or whateveriit is you're doing. I need my medicine. Bad news makes me sick. Bad news, Sasha? What happened? Have to ask faldo, if he hasn't already jumped out a window. Sasha, it's me. Edgar, it's me, Sasha. Are we in the dark here? I mean, really bad new... [Groaning] What the hell are you looking at? Never seen a thirsty woman before? [Squeaks] Uh... Boo! [Laughs] Do you think she's drunk? I think that's the least of her problems. Zoe, I really like what you did with your blouse today. It's just the three buttons. You could do it. Oh, no, I couldn't possibly. Do you think I could? I think Edgar would like it. Would he? Men are simple, Alice. (Faldo) Now, come on. (Sasha) All right. Sasha, we're going right back in there. Well, come on. Oh. Now, tell them. My confusion is exceeded only by my hangover. Sasha. Babe, what? Sweetheart, you know what to say. I apologize. Cheer up, girls. Steg saas sae =a Zoe = =f eae a = se = fellas, help me with this, will you? Let's take it in this room. Sir. [Groaning] (Faldo) It'll look best in here. Our session's taking... (Faldo) Let's find a place where we can hang it. Yeah, right there on the mantle. Get zezzy off of there. Sevy, and no, I'm not coming down. Zezzy, get down. No, I won't. Come down. Grab your equipment. Is she from Brooklyn? I thought she was Russian. Get off me! Get off! Get off! Stop it! Get off! Fine. (Faldo) All right, let's get these paintings down. (Sevy) Philistine! Bourgeois! It doesn't matter, because my art will live on, and you're just a bunch of imperialist, philistine, bourgeois shits. Excuse me. Sorry. Gentlemen. Gentlemen, if those boys on wall street are telling me the truth, the only thing I haven't lost is my manhood. Serves you right. So whose deal? Does this mean you've finally decided to join our discussion, faldo? (Faldo) Sure. Why not? I might learn something. So how you play this game? Just tell secrets? All right, fine. My introduction to sex came about through a relation, a very close relation, when I was 14. It lasted almost a year. She was young, very young. I watched her since the day she was born. How young was she? Mere child. She had brown hair, sturdy legs for her age, all four of them. [Spits] An animal? (Edgar) Faldo, we discussed bestiality briefly in an earlier session, and since everyone said they had no tendency toward it... I made no such declaration. Most everyone. We decided there was no point pursuing it. Well, there is now. Let me tell you fellows something. I have a vast collection of art which is dismissed as pornographic. But all through history, there are images of human beings copulating with every known species. Books had illustrations in them, hand-drawn illustrations, of people having sex, masturbation, and everything else. So don't forget, gentlemen... Psst. Yes? (Faldo) First and foremost, the human being is an animal. (Monty) Mr. faldo, sir, what kind of species was this one, your partner? A female donkey. [Gasps] Oh. Faldo, describe the situation as precisely as possible. Well, I would put a harness on her and lead her into the woods. And when I would take off her harness, it was like stripping the clothes off of someone. And then I'd indulge my passion through a handkerchief. What was the donkey's attitude? Well, she liked it, I mean, the first few times, and then she wouldn't... She wouldn't allow it. [Chuckling] I guess I wasn't her type. (Sevy) Um, excuse me. Mm-hmm? What position did you use? You stood on top of something, I expect. No, no, no. I was tall for my age, so we were a perfect match, height-wise. Oh, that's good. Yeah. What emotions did you feel after the act? What did I feel afterward? I was perplexed, at first, anyway. And then I was frightened to death that my old man would find out. But I just couldn't stop. I mean, I couldn't stop. Can anyone stop when it comes to sexual gratification? And why this particular animal? Well, because she was the one I saw most often, Tuesdays and Thursdays on my way home from school. Though there was a goat on Wednesday, and I climbed the fence, and I ran after him, but he was too fast. [Coughing] Zoe. (Faldo) Are you sick, young lady? Sore throat. I'm sorry. (Faldo) If 1 told you what I've done with women, you would probably get pneumonia. Sevy, I'm sorry about giving you hell for buggery the other day. That's all right, I suppose. You've inspired me to relate that I had pleasure several times with a puppy when I was a youth. [Zoe coughing] A dog, sevy? I let him nip my private parts. I became very, very aroused. Good Christ, sevy. Well, I'm glad you said that. Now it makes me feel that I'm not alone in this. Yes. Very... it was very pleasant, very pleasant indeed. No man of character would have sexual intercourse with an animal. You might be right, son. Because for me, to be perfectly frank, a donkey is just a dumb fucking ass. [Laughing] Oh, you fell for it, didn't you? [Laughter] What? You went right along with it. You should've seen your faces. You should've seen your faces. No cause for alarm, ladies. This was just a test. A test. [Laughing] Are you saying that you've been putting us on? Oh, there's no harm in a joke, Edgar. (Edgar) These sessions require you tell the truth, faldo. Oh, the truth. I've seen the truth, Edgar, and it doesn't make any sense. That may be your viewpoint, but you can't influence the others with it, not in my research. Your research, maybe. But my house. Now, relax. We got zezzy there... Sevy. To tell about his shaggy dog story. That'll help your research. Oh, woof, woof, woof. Look, Edgar, ask me one of your questions, and I promise you a straight answer. Ask one that's really important to you, the most important. What's the matter? Afraid the question might reveal too much? There's one question that's above all others. Which 1s? What does faldo think about the sssuuccuubus? The what? An imaginary female demon. Edgar's obsessed with it. The succubus isn't an imaginary creature. I've experienced her visits many times at night. In fact, I look forward to them. He's in love with her. (Faldo) I know what you're talking about. You mean a creature that sneaks in on you and steals your seed. Well, I've known plenty of those. For Christ's sake, I'm married to one. We don't know her. And we don't solicit her. Convinced she intends no harm to her victims... Unless he resists. And that's your most important question, Edgar? Some sexual compulsion for a female myth? (Edgar) This concerns deep psychic energy. It's sexual voltage. But it's not real. She's not imaginary. Do you understand? I understand, Edgar. It's rewarding to love the whore of your mind, isn't it? (Peter) But only if she drives you back to real women. (Sevy) Some women are more real than others, wherever they appear. Perhaps she's trying to rescue you, Edgar. Or perhaps Edgar's afraid of real women. Well, Edgar, just how far will you go? Just how dark will it get? That's a good question, Edgar, really good question. Maybe this bizarre sexual creature of yours will turn you into something really ugly, unfit for society. Edgar the criminal. (Faldo) But what if she exists only to warn him, to drive him back into the real world of flesh and blood? (Sevy) No, no, no, no, no, no. It's quite simple. All men are in love with this creature. And she, quite naturally, is in love with all men. Well... Love is a bolt from the blue, isn't it? [Indistinct speech] [Knock at door] I'm sorry for bothering you. Did you forget something? Well, no. Actually, I was wondering if I might be able to look at that book of engravings. Why? Well, I was curious about them and thought perhaps you wouldn't mind if I... Come in. Yes, okay. You know where it is, Alice. Yes, I found them very compelling. They are very compelling. Yes, I've never seen anything quite like them before. Are you interested in the nocturnal side of eroticism? Faldo brought up animal eroticism today. What did you think of that? I thought it was rather distasteful. I've thought about it. I've come to several conclusions. May I hear them? I'll just... Excuse me. I must congratulate myself on encountering the perfect muse. Oh, well, it was a chance encounter. All that's marvelous in life happens by chance, don't you think? Well, I suppose... Man's libido differs from animal sexuality in that it calls his whole being into question. I'm not much of an expert on the subject. Yes... But you have desires, aspirations. Everyone does. I liked what you said about destiny. [Sighs] As I look at you now, Alice, I'm reminded of the amorous radiance in every young woman. I'm afraid I'm not very good at receiving compliments. [Whispering] I haven't tried to know you, Alice. Yet in some surreal way, I sense you, as in a dream, a visitation. I've always cherished my dreams. I hope so. As a little girl, I couldn't wait to fall asleep so I could enter the dreamland. Things in dreams are so much more natural and appealing to me than what happens in real life. I... [quavers] I haven't asked you to expose yourself, Alice. No, you haven't. [Knock at door] Edgar, my friend. Lorenz. I have something of some importance to ask you. Do I have a choice? No, you don't. And I'm not staying. Oh, by the way, while I'm here, I wanted to suggest something to you... No, I think demand... That for your next session you invite a candid, uninhibited, desirable... Excuse me. Thank you. Good-bye. Woman. [Chuckles] Tell me I'm interrupting something. Oscar, do I look the way you wanted me to? Well, you're in my portfolio, aren't you? Zoe. Oscar. What a surprise. Hello. Oscar? I'm sorry. Linda, this is Zoe. Zoe is Edgar's associate. She's helping him survey sexual attitudes. I bet she is. Actually, I just write down what they say. I model for Oscar... I think you underestimate yourself. I think at the very least, you keep everyone's attention properly focused. Nude. Nothing but pictures of me and my body. All for sale? Was that an insult? No, no, no, Linda. Zoe was just pointing out that in photography, as you, yourself are a gorgeous example, the successful marketing... Can I tell you that I loved your films? Yes, please. I found them very, very enticing. Thank you very, very much. What are you doing right now? Nothing. I'm going home. Can I tell you, your hair, by the way... I love what you've done... Was I rude? I think so. Mm. Tell me something. Yes? Edgar's sessions... What about Edgar's sessions? We should film them. Edgar's sessions... You mean an all-talking picture? All-singing, all-dancing. It really doesn't matter. I like this idea. You like it? Would this be endorsing Edgar's rules, Edgar's methods? What do you mean? I mean, don't you think if you have to explain... If you try to explain how to make love like Edgar, I don't think you know how to make love. And if you do know how to make love... You probably don't want to explain it. Don't want to explain it. Or maybe you shouldn't be able to explain it, how to make love. And sound might be a problem. It doesn't matter what they say. It's what they don't say. It's what they hide. Words are just masks anyway. And I could be your assistant. And you could be my assistant. Yes. Do you have... And would you please be my assistant beginning right now? Hold still. What about love itself? And what about love itself? If you could make a picture of that, you'd be very successful. I think I already have. [Giggling] What? I think you've stimulated me beyond images. We should play at something else. Oscar? What? Is this another game? This is the most serious game of all. When you define something, create something for us, only... Oscar? Yes? Promise me something. Yes. Whether this lasts or not, you'll never try and explain it to anybody. [Rain falling] Doesn't Alice look beautiful? Ready. Do certain images come to mind during desire? Faldo? [Faldo snoring] Faldo. Care to answer the question? Oh, images during desire. Well, give me a piece of paper and I'll doodle for you. (Peter) Sevy? What? Save us. Well, it's never one single image. The last time, it was underwater imagery, very nautical. (Edgar) Nautical? I imagined mermaids with their scaly behinds. I imagined hovering over giant oysters, many, many oysters, waiting to swallow me, and flippers. (Peter) Chloe, what about you? What about... Do you want to be included? Well, I don't think you can ask the same question of women. Their minds are not like glass-bottom boats. In any case, my images aren't physical ones. I have an image. Describe it. Describe it. Someone blonde, slim, distinguished, different from her husband too. Ow. I can't help it. Oh, no. It's not my fault. I always imagine a woman I want to sleep with. I imagine the gasp that she makes. A woman fully clothed who says nothing at all. She wears perfumed gloves, though, sometimes. Chloe's face. [Film whirring] (Sasha) The most direct... (Faldo) What the hell's that mean, Sasha? (Sasha) It means that you like to see what you're getting into, and I like to see what's getting into me. Move over. Now, what if I were to say... And sometimes, only sometimes, when we're together, I'm imagining another woman? [Both laugh] Well, I might be imagining the same woman. What are you trying to say, sash? What trying? What trying? (Faldo) What are you trying to say? (Sasha) Listen, Edgar instructed us to follow the rules. And I'm following the rules. And you got to play by the rules too. I never follow the damn rules any time. And we suddenly find ourselves in complete financial ruin. Oh, bullshit! We're not in financial ruin! We've got that estate up in Montreal, faldo studios in Hollywood, tax write-offs. [Yelling at the same time] Get the hell out of here! We've got those sexual paintings. They're the greatest paintings in the world. (Sasha) Oh, I hate those. W-w-what... We have nothing. We have paintings! What part of the body most excites you, faldo? If you don't mind. What part of the body? Yeah, see, we're going to talk about something else now. We're not going to talk about anything. Now, sit down, Sasha. Oh, goddamn it, you. Now, sit down. I'm not going... Sit down! Uh! All right. Edgar, what gets you started? (Sasha) Get out of here. I can't stand you. I cannot stand you. [Both groaning] A woman's desire. Dreams, of course. Cleavage in a very low-cut dress. Buttocks. The eyes. (Peter) The eyes, Chloe's eyes. (Sasha) Beautiful, sensuous, loving eyes. The eyes are the most sexual. No, the sex is the most sexual. For god's sake, a woman's sex. That is so true. A man is an animal looking to drop his seed in some warm female belly. That's right. (Sasha) Dear, did you tell them about the time you seduced the mule? Shh, Sasha. He said it was a joke. Well, of course he did. [Chuckles] Y-you mean, it wasn't a joke? Well, how can you do that? It's disgusting. I thought the whole episode was rather sweet. It's sickening. What mule? He had sexual intercourse with a donkey. You mean he put his cock in a donkey's pussy? [Giggling] [Thunder cracks] (Sasha) What? Sex is in the groin of the beholder. I like a woman's breasts when her nipples are hard, especially a beautiful woman whose nipples I'm about to lick or suck. In other words, you love to arouse a woman. What about you? Oscar? Yes. What about me? I believe the question was, what arouses you, Oscar? For me, it's something completely indefinable. It's her expression, suggestion, sensuality, eyes. But the thought of a woman's orgasm, this is the most important thing. Well put. Sex. Who likes to see the sex? I like to look at mine when I'm alone... With an erection. Yes. Well, aren't we all great masturbators? [Faldo and Sasha kissing] This is turning into something else here. Sensuality has a light all its own. It glows, and it radiates. It's always pure. (Sasha) Oh, excuse me. Sex is only pure with someone I love, who I'm with, someone I love. An investigation of sex, not love. That's what I was afraid of, confusing the two. Monty, let's go to the bar. We've been married 20 years. Well, you know, I am not confused. When I think of having sex, most men are the same. Love, however, is my delusion that one man is different from another. Yes, I meant my own confusion. You're confused about love too, Janet? Oh, it's confusing. Are you kidding? Me too. (Janet) I know that it should be fun, at least as fun as sex when sex is fun. (Sasha) Sex can be fun. Love mostly... Hurts. Yes. (Sasha) I don't know what to do about it. It's vicious. It's scarier. (Sasha) It's a nightmare. So sex is only pure with someone you love, huh? You've never had sex with someone you didn't love? I've never slept with a woman I didn't believe I could love. Naturally, I've been mistaken a time or two. (Faldo) Is it always mental with you, Edgar, even sex? I've told you, I'm not looking for lovemaking. I'm looking for a woman to love. (Faldo) If you had a choice between sexual pleasure... Accompanied with love that you could satisfy right now, immediately... Or mental satisfaction, which would you choose? There's no choice. Desire accompanied by love would give me complete satisfaction. I'd be willing to surrender my freedom for it. Even to something inhuman? I'm looking for something that hasn't happened before and never will again. Well, I just want the ultimate sexual thrill, because there's something between a man and a woman. And it's this tremendous physical attraction. And when I'm with a woman, I get more excitement and satisfaction than money or art or anything in the world could possible give me. If you love her. I love faldo so much sometimes I could kill him. I mean, I would gladly see him dismembered. Sasha, that's awful. [Chuckles] (Sasha) I know it's awful, but he does awful things to me. Perhaps you can only love a man if you hate him. [Sniffs] I wish that wasn't true. But why is it? Because love is warfare. I got to get back. Sasha's going to cut off my ultimate sexual thrill. So did you ladies learn anything? Did you learn anything, ladies? Does sevy ever tell you what an attractive woman you are? He paints me as a ghoul. But to sevy, everything is monstrous. Here you go. Oh, yeah. [Moaning] This is ridiculous. I don't think you can investigate sex or love like it was some kind of experiment. At last, a human voice is heard. You still afraid of experimentation, Chloe? No, Edgar, not if it's romantic. (Edgar) Romance is false. It's delusional. [Breathing heavily] [Whispers] Let's get out of here. Okay. Edgar, you're just upset because Chloe doesn't love you anymore, if she ever did. Peter, it's not for you to talk about. (Peter) No, I want to talk about it. Edgar, you don't know how to romance a woman, but I do. When I love a woman, I need something more substantial than romance. How do you know? You never loved. You don't respect anyone, Edgar, especially women. Respect has to be earned in women as in men. If you mean me, just say it to my face. I've nothing to say to a man who's had sex once. I didn't say anything. Uh! Uh! Oh! Ah! [Lightning crackling] [Gasps] Get in. Go where? Get in. Now. I want it now! What are you doing? I want to make love with you. Like this? Yes, yes. I want to make love to you. No, no, no. Yes. It doesn't work like this. Turn around. What are you doing? I want to make love to you. Like this? Yes. But I've... I've never, never... [Screams] [Moaning] [Intense moaning and screaming] Are you faking? [Wheezing] Can I trust you? It's important. Don't fake. Shut up! [Intense moaning] Somebody's in a hurry. Oh, babe. You can keep the painting. Peter. You all right? Edgar, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Edgar. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I hurt you, didn't I? Probably. Well, you'll get used to it. You all right? Chloe? What? Marry me. What? Marry me, Chloe. (Edgar) I'm sorry to have wasted your time with this. I don't feel as though I'm wasting it. Marry me; Marry me; Marry me; Marry me. Oh, shh. Was that a yes? I don't... know. "I don't know" or "no"? Oh, babe. Maybe this is an appropriate time to terminate this. [Heavy breathing and panting] Why don't you have Oscar take a picture? It'll last longer. Believe me, sev, your marriage is a mess. It didn't mix with my research. Oh, yes, it did. Probing our most intimate behavior, exploring each of our darkest secrets. I hold you personally responsible for its current debasement. And I thank you very much for that. Alice. Yes? I owe you a Sincere apology for a gross perversion I committed against the innocence of your nature. You've been nothing but kind, and please don't change. Thank you. [Moaning and heavy breathing] Still on for squash? Tuesday, 4:00. [Intense moaning] [Panting] Let's do it for the first time once again, yes? Let's do it. Oh, baby. Bollocks. Oh, hello, sevy. [Panting] Your wife and I are going to a place that you wouldn't understand. Yes. I'm going on an expedition now, searching for my share of happiness. You don't need me anyway, do you, sevy? No, I don't need you. But I love you. (Monty) Poor guy. I feel terrible. [Frantic kissing] Time to go. I think your being so fond of yourself is wonderful, Edgar, because then you can give so much pleasure to other people. One of your goals should be someday to have your own billboard. Everyone could see it and feel a little happier knowing you're looking down on them. Sorry. Ooh. Oh, god. It isn't easy, Alice, trying to reshape this corrupt world of ours. I don't know that you can reshape something that has no shape. Humans are more or less helpless. I'd like to visit you, Edgar. A visitation? I feel that we have a lot in common. I'd like to visit you. Only if I summon you. If you don't summon me soon, perhaps I'll summon you. [Thunder booming] Look, Edgar, I'm willing to admit that sometimes thinking about your desire is better than satisfying it. Love's a bolt from the blue. Bolt from the blue, huh? Well, there must be a lot of bolts from the blue out there, because around us right now, there are thousands of couples having sex and making love, and they don't think anything about it. Yeah. But I'm willing to bet they're a damn sight happier than you are. Everyone's happier than I am, faldo. But I believe that's better than living a lie. Well, truth is elusive, Edgar. You scared away that pretty little Alice, didn't you? Chose your mythical creature over a real woman. You didn't have to go out in the world, take a risk, get hurt, break your heart. She didn't even fall in love with the whole of your mind, just a small little part of it, Edgar, a little compulsion obsession. When you love that thin, it's very difficult to know what is real. But you got your phantom. Well, you have your phantom. Well... God bless you. Bless you. (Edgar) I believe in the future resolution of the two states, dream and reality, which are seemingly contradictory. [Mutters indistinctly] Nevertheless, I reserve the right to change my mind. [Breathing heavily] No, wait. Don't go, please. Come back. [Whispers] I love you. I'll have to finish this one of these days.
