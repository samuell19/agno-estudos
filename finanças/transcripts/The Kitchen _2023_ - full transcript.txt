This was good, love. But I gotta get ready to work, y'all. Have fun with the Wicked Witch of the basement. Yo, that shit banging, boy. Appreciate it, bro.

But how I she expect this to get anywhere with this shit if we can't even be here during prime creativity hours? Man, kick that nigga Paul out and let your boy move in. No, facts. Paul ass won't be doing shit no way, you feel me? That's my nigga, though, bro. Hey, speaking of kicking niggas out, whatever happened with that Boy Josh? Fuck Josh, bro. Damn, what I miss? Nigga was trying to fight me on some tough guy shit, bro. Like, long story, bro. Well shit, I got a time. We ain't got no clients, man. What the fuck happened? Well look, apparently he ain't like the way I came at him and, like, the whole time bro ain't paid rent in like three months, like, this shit ain't cheap, bro. Like, I'm already on the verge of losing all this shit, bro. Damn. So where y'all scrap at, down here? No. In the kitchen. Nigga, I would have took a frying pan and mopped his head. Hell no. But dog, bro, like, you really fixing to lose this spot. Like, on some g-shit. Like, you really fixing to lose it. Yeah, man. Lo said I got two weeks to come up with the bread. Damn, how much you owe him? About 10 bands. Yeah. Shit. Bro, you ain't paid your rent in six months? Bro, with what, bro? Like, bro, my birthday was in February. You know what I'm saying, like, I had the PPP shit here. You know what I'm saying, I broke my man's off about eight bands. And then Tracy wanted to take her ass to DC on some splurge shit dinners, going out. Bro, I'm still trying to recoup from all that, bro. Look, look, look, fuck, all right, look. We're going to get the bread up, bro. I can call cut, shit we can go slide on some niggas. Hell no, bro. You know I'm trying to make this music shit work, bro.

Like, if me, you and could, like, just put together five bands each. Oh, no, I'm sorry. Forgive me. That's like 15, we won't need that much. But we could just put five racks up between all three of us, right, then put it down on this fight. You know what I'm saying, I think-- you know what I'm saying, that could be a good move for us to save the house. For sure, bro. I mean, it sound good, bro. But you know I got to run it past Tracy, bro. So like, you know what I'm saying. In the meantime, bro, let's get back to cooking bro. I'm going to holler at the old lady later, bro. I'll let you know how everything shake out. All right, all right, all right. Yeah, for sure. Oh, what's up, Mo? Hey, y'all. You can't speak? I already spoke to the owner of the house, freeloader. Bitch. Oh! Girl, you scared the shit out of me. Auntie, we got to talk. What's up, baby? I seen you called me. I talked to Tasha last night and I think mama might know. No. What? Shit, how? I went out to the club last night and we was in our home-girl section, so I made out with this girl that I've seeing for a couple of weeks. OK, Sandy, what does my sister have to do with any of this? Auntie, somebody showed mama my friend's Instagram story. Oh. Baby, I'm so sorry. She says she still want to want to see me for Thanksgiving. I can't deal with that, man. You know how my mama is. I don't want to deal with her attitude. You know how the time Uncle Trip brought a man over for Thanksgiving? I got to get this money together, fast. This poor girl don't stand a chance with my sister. Auntie Mona? I just got to find a window later on tonight. Auntie Mona? Oh, baby. I'm so sorry-- You just ignoring me? Uh, uh, Sandy. Now you not the only one going through shit in this house. Yeah, but you the only one I can talk to you about my shit. I thought you'd be understanding of that. You're just like everybody else. OK. Now what you're not fixing to do is belittle me in my own space. That I'm not going to have. And one more thing, I've defended you for years when it came to and your mother. For years. And one more thing, Sandy-- What? She already knew. Excuse me? Yeah. You remember that little friend that you had when you were 12? The one you was always with, lollygagging with all the time? Well, yeah. One day the little girl spent the night over. Your mother seen y'all kiss. You lying. Sandy, why would I have to lie about anything like that? Explain to me that. Yeah, she saw y'all. OK? Was she mad? Of course. But she never said nothing to your father. And she definitely caught me that same night, though. I don't-- I don't believe this. I mean, look, Sandy. Look, that's your mother. After all these years, you know, she kind of thought it was a phase that you was going through. But you know, she could tell. No, I can't believe that y'all wouldn't tell me something like that. That could have completely changed my relationship with my mother. Why would you deprive me of that? You were just thinking about not going. Keyword was thinking, Auntie. You know what? I don't got time for this. I'm out of here. Oh, yeah? Where you going, Einstein? Since you know it all. I'm fixing to go live my life. Something you would know about if you weren't so stuck up in your crackhead bitch of an ex-boyfriend. Daddy left the day I-- Who is it? Chef Ramsay. Go away, Tracy. I'm not in the mood. Fuck everything-- Well I'm coming in anyway. Bitch, did you not hear me? Look, I just came in for two reasons. One, to tell you that I'm ordering pizza from the place by the mall. You know they got to a vegan menu. And I know how you was feeling. What's wrong? Girl, I'm feeling fucked up. What happened? Um. First of all, don't get too damn comfortable. Girl, what's wrong with you? I know your nosy ass heard me and Sandy argument. And she just stormed out of here. Just got up, left. I don't even know if she's going to be back. But do you care? Of course I care. It's my damn niece. But I'm 32 Trace. Obviously, I'm not having no kids right now. That's my baby, like, Sandy is the closest thing I ever have to a daughter. I don't want to lose her or that relationship. I feel you because my sister and I had the same type of relationship. And the best way to handle something like this is just to take it head on because if I was you, I would not wait a couple of hours before I reach out. That's just my advice. Yeah, that don't sound too bad. Who would have thought your ass would be giving some good advice? And who would have known that your room is not as messy as you. Oh. Bitch, fuck you. I got so much shit on my mind. It's just, like, when I first came here, I was in a fucked up place. Like, I ain't have no job. Me and my nigga had just broke up. Toxic as fuck. Sandy was begging to live with me, but I couldn't have her around all that shit. That nigga just did too fucking much. I feel you. But it's crazy because it's like, I was feeling good, like, when I moved here. I got me a little job. Moved my way up. I got way more money. It's like, that shit just still can't take me away from my problems. Like, it doesn't change anything. I just really feel like I'm just deeper than when I first came here. It's just, fuck. I think we all feel that way in some point. Where you five steps forward, then getting knocked 10 steps backward the whole world.. What the fuck, you a conspiracy theorist now? And no, I'm just a person looking for they own pot of gold. Well, news flash, home girl. That rainbow you looking for it's long fucking gone. You know what, Mona. Sometimes the rainbow is right above you and maybe that's why you never saw it. Change my mind. Close my door. Fuck everything I-- yesterday-- Keep dropping the ball, bro. I just don't understand this shit, bro. Good style, let's go, let's go. They just paid this man all this money, he can't catch the ball on third down? Bro, like-- Hey, bro. Trade his ass. What you got? All that shit you talking about. You got it, bro. What you mean? I'm just saying, bro. Damn we got-- Babe, you couldn't have went around for all that shit? You see the game on. Boy, fuck you and the Cowboys. All right, keep talking, girl. You going to get body slammed talking about these Cowboys. You heard what she said. C'mon, racist bullshit. Let's go. I just don't understand, like-- Get him out of here, bro. What are you going to-- Who would leave all of this for nothing? Oh, no. Eli got to see this. Girl, what the hell was so damn-- oh, shit.

I'm fixing to grab me a drink before I dip though. OK. You know, I didn't want to say nothing, but I heard what happened with you and Sandy last night. It's fine. She'll be all right. I guess I just wanted to see her to see if she accepts my apology, if she all right. Yeah, she good. Don't even stress about it. I guess you're right. I don't hear no commotion. When Josh gonna see you dead. Yeah, you're funny. I don't know. I seen him earlier when I pulled up not too long ago. Did they say where they was going? I mean, I ain't ask him.

Maybe it is when you're being controlled, controlled by a feeling that can't be seen. Before we sprout it, the plant, the seed, the seed of envy, the seed of jealousy, the seed of evil and the seed of greed. Those seeds grew bigger and later provided the social air we breathe. But the seed of greed has done its deed and grew to the heights that one could believe it. No one has the courage to chop it down. So Tracy, what the fuck? Where the money at? I don't know. Look, I came back to the house because I knew somebody here had to take it. Bitch, I thought you said you didn't know where no money was at? Are you fucking deaf? I said I took the money, but I don't got it now. So now what? Bitch, I should have shot so sheisty fucking ass. Maybe you should of then, I should have. You know what?

Did not fuck him. And I can't believe you going to believe Mona over me. Tracy, I don't know what the fuck to believe. You grimy enough to steal from somebody. How the fuck I know you ain't fuck Paul? How the fuck am I stealing from somebody and it wasn't even hers? You know what, believe this. Nigga, if I walk out this door, I ain't coming back. Well do it with some pace in your step. And get the fuck out. Boy, fuck you. Oh, yeah? Bitch, I'm thugging, but I gotta get some feelings off. I might skirt and hit the dash on the city cop. Sit a girl and get the drop up on the city.. Keep talking silly about her, bitch, well now I fuck with y'all. Young and ,, but I just got to get some feelings off. Skirt and I hit the dash on the city cop. Sit the girl on the drop to the city hop. Keep talking crazy about it bitch-- Yo, Mo, you mind if I come in for a minute? Yeah, you're good. I just wanted to bring you your mail and on the real, Mo, I wish things could have worked out a little bit better between us, you know? Yeah, me too all right. Right because I can't really afford this place by myself, so you know I'm going to have to make a few moves. Well, honestly I hope everything works out for you, Eli. Take care of yourself, Mo. You too, Eli. I can't call that love, no, no, no, no. This. You meant everything you say is fucking drama. You always out here whining. Always got a problem. Ain't that the reason you wiling?? Ain't that the reason your niggas?? Hey auntie Mo-Mo, you already know who this is by now. I'm so sorry it took so long for me to let you know that I'm OK. I know you've been worried out of your mind, but-- but there's no need to worry. I'm good. I just wanted to let you know how much I love you and appreciate you. You're like my second mother and I'll always be grateful for that. Because of you, I'm becoming a better, stronger woman just like you. I received your message and I was on my way to let you know that I'm so sorry for what I said to you and how I just walked out on you, but God had better plans for me. As I was approaching the house, I saw Tracy walk out the side door and put a bag in the back of Eli's car. She looked worried and scared and made me curious to think there was something in it. Something important. I didn't know what it could have been, but I just heard a voice in my head say go. Yeah. Yeah. Damn. I watch this shit breaking down my circle, all different shapes. Got me learning from my L's everybody make mistakes. Every homie ain't your homie. Every bitch ain't your bae. Relying on a fire, chopper singing kumbaya. I knew you wasn't. So if you look at your package, I just wanted to show you a small token of appreciation for being in my life, just something little to keep you warm in this cold world. I decided to get in my car and travel wherever my heart tells me to go. I hope I find myself like I found that bag and I hope you find it in your heart to forgive me. Take care, Auntie Momo. Love, Sandy. Oh! My God! Oh, my God. Oh! It seems she know my style now. Oh, my God. Time to get up and out of here. What's up, E? Oh, what's up, Mo?
