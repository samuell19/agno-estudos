[Ominous music] [Pen scratching] [Music continues] Female: Please, let this get to April. [Door closes] [Mailbox creaks] Female #2: [Voices whispering] Rachel. We just want to talk. I must have the echo. I will find you. * [Voices whispering] [Ominous music] [Voices whispering] She's here. Upstairs. [Music continues] Rachel? Come on out. We just want to talk. It's a trick! Get her! [Intense music] Oh! Ugh. Ah. Ah. No. * Rachel: Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh, uh! Ahh! Going somewhere, dear? Rachel: Uh! Ahhh! Unh! Uh! Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh! * female #2: It's mine now. Give it to me. Rachel: [Gasping] No! It can't be. Agh! She doesn't have it! [Sighs] [Mellow flute music] Female #2: Who is this child? [Music continues] I wonder. Clean up this mess. Get her outta here. * [car starts] [Alarm beeping] Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep! Mmm. Hmm. [Beeping continues] Whose turn is it to take Sarah to school today? Yours. [Beeping continues] I took her yesterday. I took her three days last week when you were under deadline. Ohh. [Pouts] [Sighs] I liked it better when she went to public school. At least they had a bus. I'll pick her up after play rehearsal. How's that? Mmm, deal. [Sighing] [Door opens] Morning sweetie. Sarah: Mmm. Come on. Time to wake up. Mommy, it's too early. I don't want to. Well, you have to. It's a school day. Come on. Female #3: What's this? Sarah: Umm. Sarah? Have you been feeding Helga people food again? Honey. Hey there, sweetie. Come here. Come on. Good morning. It's okay. It's okay. I told you. It's really bad for her. Sarah: Sorry. I just thought she was tired of eating the same thing every day. She's a hedgehog. I don't think she cares. Okay. Did you hear something? Okay, come on. Let's go. Mmm. Hmmm. Don't forget to brush your teeth. Sarah: Okay. [Door bumps] Bump! [Scoffs] Must be losing my mind. * [knocking] Knock, knock, knock * [knocking] Knock, knock, knock [door creaks] Creak! Female #4: Can I help you? Morning. Does April Reilly live here? Who wants to know? L.a.p.d. We'd like to speak with Ms. Reilly for a moment if that's alright. Is she in some kind of trouble? Ma'am. This is very important. May we please come in and speak with her? [Door creaks] Creak have a seat. I'll get her. [Door creaks and closes] Can I help you? April Reilly? Yes. Hi, I'm detective Mike Simmons. This is my partner, Dan Crawford. L.a.p.d. Mm, what's this about? You've got a lot of interesting stuff laying around here. It's not mine, it's Casey's. She runs a special makeup effects shop. Oh, she's, uh, your-- April: My wife. You have a little girl. Mmm hmm. Mike: Must be weird for her to see all these dead body parts lying around. April: She's smart enough to know it's all make believe. Hmm. Are you involved in movies as well? April: I'm a news producer for a tabloid show. Do you mind telling me what this is about? Are you acquainted with a young woman by the name of Rachel Coleman? Uh. I used to be. Mike: What was your relationship to miss Coleman? April: We were involved. But that was ten years ago. Are you still in contact with her? No. She's dead. She drowned. But they never found the body. April: It was in the middle of the ocean. That would be a little difficult. What's going on? Two days ago, the San Francisco pd got a call from a resident in an upscale neighborhood outside the city. Placing a call about a disturbance coming from a home bordering her property which was up for sale. The police checked it out. It seems that Rachel Coleman had been squatting in this house for at least a month. April: No. That's impossible. She's dead. I saw it. She drowned. Did you see her drown or did you see her just fall into some water. I know what I saw. Now, Ms. Reilly. Well, it seems that the person or persons in question had left a short while before. Now, I'd like to show you something. These were taken from the security surveillance cameras on the street after a neighbor reported hearing screaming coming from the house. The woman is Anne cassavettes. She's been on the FBI wanted list for a lot of years. What would somebody like Anne cassavettes want with miss Coleman? No. I have no idea what this is. Ms. Reilly. I understand that this is all a huge shock to you. But if there's any information that you know that could help us catch this person, Ms. Reilly. Rachel Coleman is dead. I don't know where any of this is leading. But I'd like you to leave my house. * Mike: If you change your mind. Please, don't hesitate to call. [Dark music] [Door closes] We can take Sarah to school if you want. No, no, no, no. It's okay. Okay? Just, I didn't think I'd have to deal with any of this again. What if Sarah finds out? Sarah: I can't find my butterfly clip. April: Well, I guess you'll have to do without it for today. Come on. Let's get going. I'll talk to you tonight. Casey: Okay. April: Yeah. Bye. [Door creaks open and closed] Were those guys policemen? Yes they were. Were they busting you for something? No, we're not busted. Then what did they want? They wanted to know about an old friend of mine. Who? My friend Rachel. She died when you were very young. Did she do something bad? I don't know. [Car starts] [Melancholy music] [Knocking] Knock, knock, knock, knock good morning. April: Hey Sheila. I know, I'm behind. I promise I'll have something for you to look at by mid-morning. Actually, I just came here to let you know that there's some woman here to see you. I don't have any appointments this morning. I definitely don't think she's a client. April: Can I help you? April Reilly? Yes? I was a friend of Rachel Coleman's. The police were at your house this morning. They were looking for Rachel. That means she's still alive, isn't she? How do you know the police were at my house? Have you heard from Rachel? No. Rachel's dead. [Crying] Have they found her body? No. She, she died ten years go. This whole thing with the police is just some sort of mistake. I thought she might still be alive. I always thought she faked her death to trick them. She was protecting you. She wouldn't have done it otherwise. Protecting me from what? Did Rachel ever tell you about the echo project? Echo project? Dr. Cassavettes' school. The experiment. She never told you about that? You mean, Anne cassavettes? No, that was his wife. How do you know about her? The detective. He mentioned her name. What did he say about her? Have they found her? No. They think they've seen her. The police, they're looking for information. He knows something. He could probably help. Here. The detective. He gave me his card. You should call him. I don't wanna deal with cops. You know something. I have to go. April: Wait. I don't even know your name. Is there any way I can reach you? No, there is not. [Ominous music] [Phone beeps] Beep it's me. You're never gonna believe who I just saw walking out of April Reilly's office. * [phone ringing] Ring! Ring! Hold on while I get that. Try not to move, otherwise we'll have to do this over again. Okay? [Ringing continues] Gore girls. Casey? Casey: Hey hon. You doing okay? Can I talk to you about something? What is it? April: A woman came into my office this morning. She was asking about Rachel. Rachel, again? Who was it this time? I have no idea. She creeped me out. She did not seem well at all, mentally. Believe me. Well, maybe it was one of Rachel's ex-girlfriends. You did say she had a few, and not all of them normal from what I heard. April: Casey? I'm worried about Sarah. I mean, what if there is something to all of this? Do you think we should tell her? I can't make that decision for you. Whatever you decide, I'm behind it. Okay? Okay. You probably have your hands full. I should let you go. You're still picking up Sarah, right? Yeah, of course. April: Okay. I'll talk to you later. Love you. Casey: Love you too. Bye. [Ominous music] Terry. Can you do me a favor? What's up? Can you do some research for me on a woman named Anne cassavettes? Which piece is this for? Actually it, it isn't for a piece. It's personal. Whoa. I-If Richard finds out that I do something like that, you know I get in major trouble, right? Richard won't find out. Please, Terry? I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't for something important. Anne cassavettes? Right. I'm gonna have to make up some kind of long-term story or tell him you're working on an extended piece, I mean. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know as soon as you find out something. And I promise I'll make it up to you. Yeah, you better. Oh, and Terry? Can you see if there's any connection between this cassavettes person and something called the echo project? What in the world are you into? That's what I'm trying to find out. [Melancholy music] [Door locks] Click [music continues] [Phone beeps] Beep, beep, beep * [phone ringing] Ring male: Los Angeles police department. Hi. Detective Michael Simmons, please. Male: He's not in the office at the moment. May I take a message? Yes. My name is Yelena markova and I have some information about one of his cases. Male: Okay. Is this the best number to reach you? 3070? Yes. That's my home number. Male: Okay. We'll let the detective know. Thanks. * [knob creaks] Creak [shower water falling] [Knocking] Knock, knock, knock, knock [music continues] [Knocking] Knock, knock, knock, knock [Door unlocks and creaks open] Ahhh! [Knife slices] Shing! [Intense music] [Knocking] Knock, knock, knock, knock they left your mail on my desk again. Okay. Great, thanks. Female #4: Richard wants to see you again, also. He wants to go over that weekend piece again. Whenever you have a chance. Okay, tell him I'll be right in. [Paper rustling] * [rustling continues] Rachel: Dear April, I don't know where to begin. I know that for the past ten years you believed me to be dead. So I can't imagine what you'd be feeling right now. I just hope you'll understand that what I did was for your protection and for my daughter's. There's something I have to tell you. Before we met, I was involved in something called the echo project. I could try to explain it but right now, all you need to know is that since the project ended, all the other subjects have been killed. If they find me, they'll kill me. And if they find out I have a daughter, they'll kill her too. That's why I had to contact you. I miss you so much. I'll see you again soon. And I can explain everything. But until then, you must keep this a secret for her sake. If anyone were to find out, everything we care about could be lost. Love, Rachel. * Sarah: Can you help me practice my lines tonight? There's this one line I keep forgetting. Casey: Which part? You know where I call the sea monster a liar? Still? Alright. I'll help you run through it again tonight. Yeah, upside down. What? Tracy summerfield says she remembers her lines upside down 'cause she says it gets all the blood to her brain and she remembers better. Well, we'll see how much she remembers when she passes out. No, really. She showed me how to make my face turn red. Wanna see? Who did? Tracy summerfield. Watch. Alright, Sarah. That's enough. You're killing your brain cells. Come on. How is it killing brain cells? Casey: I don't know. No, no, no, no. How? Mom? Mom? Hey, sweetheart. How are you? What's wrong? Um. I'm fine. Just a really long day at work. Sarah, can I talk to April alone for a minute? Is it about the policemen this morning? I wanna stay and listen. Honey, could you go wash your hands for me? I'm gonna put dinner on soon. Okay. Thank you. What's going on? Has it got something to do with that woman that showed up at your office? April, why should you be worried about that? You said so yourself. Rachel's dead. Why won't you say something? It's, it's nothing. Just, it's just been a really weird day, you know. So let's talk about it. We will. But, you know, later tonight. Okay? I just, I, I just wanna get dinner started and clear my head. [Dogs barking] Woof-woof, woof-woof I'll see you in the morning, okay. We'll go through those lines again. That's okay. I think I got it now. You sure? Yeah. I read it upside down. Oh. Right. So, Friday night's the big night. I already got our tickets. We're in the third row. You'll be able to see us from the stage. You're not supposed to look at the audience. Oh, right. I forgot. Sleep tight, honey. See you in the morning. Good night, mom. Good night. [Door closes] You can come out now. [Door creaks] [Voices whispering] * hey. You was right about the kid. I say we move in tonight. * what if she's not dead? What if that woman was telling the truth? You think she'll come looking for you? No, it's... It's not that. It's just... What if someone found out about Sarah? What if someone did? What the fuck is it, tuna? Look, I don't know why you're so concerned about Sarah all of a sudden. I'd like a little communication here. She's my kid too. I have a right. [Door opens] [April and Casey whispering] Casey: What is it? I just thought maybe it's time we told Sarah. About Rachel? I mean, she's old enough to know and... What if something were to happen? I, I wouldn't feel right if Sarah didn't know the truth. Then tell her. Right now? [Dreary music] If it's bothering you that much, maybe you should. For your sake, not just hers. Will you come with me? Is that enough? What's wrong? [Voices whispering] [Gasps] Honey. What are you doing up? Who's this for? It's for nobody. What do you mean nobody? Sarah. Was someone here? I can't tell. What do you mean? Sarah, was someone in here? She's my friend. Who? Honey, you're not in trouble. I need you to tell me, okay. Please. I can't. She told me if I told anybody, they'd find her. She just wants my help. She's just hungry, is all. Where is she? In the closet. [Ominous music] [Door creaks] Creak honey, there's no one in here. I saw her. She told me you were coming. What? She told me someone's coming! [Glass breaks] Crash! * Sarah, I need you to stay right here, okay? Do not leave your room. [Ominous music] [Door rattling] Oh my god. Call the police. Go! [Music continues] Sarah? Sarah! Sarah! Oh! Oh god, Sarah's gone! April, calm down. She couldn't have gone far. Oh my god! Just call the police. Okay. I'll find her. [Music continues] Female #5: 911. Stay your emergency. Hello. We need your help. Someone's breaking into our house. Female #5: Okay ma'am. What's your address? 1425 alta Sierra. Hurry. [Door rattling] Sarah! Sarah! Sarah? [Rattling continues] [Door breaks] Boom! It's just the-- * [footsteps] [Ominous music] She's here somewhere. [Music continues] [Voices whispering] She's still in the house. Keep looking. [Music continues] [Footsteps] [Voices whispering] * [sirens wailing] Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo! Anne: Out the back door, now! * thank god! Thank god! Calm down. There's three people in the house. Where are they? They're still in the house. Okay, alright. You okay? Yeah, yeah. Stay here. Casey! April? Hold on, they're coming. Sarah. Sarah. Where did you go to? You scared us to death. Honey, what's wrong? Sarah. * Mike: Hi. I'm detective Michael Simmons. L.a.p.d. I'm here to see April Reilly, Sarah Reilly's mother. Sure. [Phone dialing] Beep, beep, beep hi, I have a detective Michael Simmons here to see April Reilly. Great. Just one minute. Thank you. Detective. Did you catch them? Mike: No. We searched the whole area. No trace. How is she? Oh, thank you. She's in shock. They're gonna keep her overnight. Well, that sounds hopeful. Listen, we do have one lead. Did a woman name Yelena markova come to your office today? A woman came to my office. She didn't tell me her name but that must've been her. I gave her your card. Did she contact you? She left a message for me while I was out of the office. Have you talked to her yet? I sent a unit over to her house when I got the message. They found her body inside. She was murdered. Oh my god. Casey: Murdered. You mean by the same people who were at our house. We don't know that but it's possible. Listen, when she came to the office, do you recall any part of her conversation? Um, she was a friend of Rachel's. She knew you had been asking me about her. I gave her your card, but she said she didn't want to involve the police. Did she say why? April: No. She was scared. She mentioned something about an experiment that Anne cassavettes was involved in. Something called the echo project. [Sarah screaming] Ahhh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Male #2: Sarah, Sarah. It's okay. Settle down. Sarah: Ahh! Ahh! April: What's wrong? Sarah: Ahh! Ahh! April: Sarah? Sarah honey. Baby, look at me. Honey. Mom. I'm here. Don't play the echo game. April: What, what is the echo game? She told me never to play it. Who told you that? The girl in my room. Honey. There was no one in your room. Yes there was! He has a picture of her in his pocket. [Ominous music] Sarah: [Whispering] That's her! April: Rachel. When did you see Rachel? All the time. Where? Was she in our house? Sarah, this is really important. Where is Rachel now? I don't want her to get caught. Nothing's going to happen to her, I promise, okay. We're safe here. Now where is she? It doesn't matter. Just tell me where she is, Sarah. Knock it off. Why don't they believe me? [Voices whispering] Sarah: Why can't they? Why? Doctor, what's wrong with her? She's hallucinating badly. It could be the medication. But at least she's talking. Mike: Sarah, you said your friend was worried about being caught. Who is she hiding from? The teacher. Why? What does she want? Her echo. What do you mean her echo? Sarah. Sarah. Doctor: I think she should just rest. Okay. Doctor: You're okay. We'll watch her. This, uh, this woman that was murdered. How did she die? Her throat was cut. * you think it has something to do with this cassavettes person? The one Sarah's talking about. You heard the doctor say she was heavily hallucinating. But if she did see Rachel, I don't know what we could do. I'm sick of hearing about Rachel. Besides, you've no hard proof that she's alive. I do. Can I talk to you outside? I have something to show you. * I received a letter from Rachel. It arrived at my work this afternoon. She said Sarah might be in danger. Why didn't you tell me about this? She said to keep it quiet. I believed her. You put our daughter's life in danger just to keep it quiet. Miss lin. Please. Please. Can I see the letter? Yeah. * [paper rustling] * Sarah is Rachel's daughter. She's our daughter. Rachel is her birth mother. April: Yes. But we raised her as our own. I wish you would've told me this earlier. I didn't think it mattered. Sarah never even knew about Rachel. No one knew. This woman, Anne cassavettes. You think she knows? That would explain why they broke into your house. They know Rachel will try to contact her daughter. But why would they want Rachel? I guess the whole answer is in this echo business. But until we find that out, I'm gonna put extra surveillance on you and your entire family. I'm gonna put an extra guard in the lobby downstairs. If you need to go anywhere, we'll have an escort for you. This is just until we solve this. Okay? * you should've told me about the letter. I was going to. I just... I just needed time to process all of this. I could've helped you. You know you can always come to me when you need to. Why didn't you? Casey. Please. Please don't do this. You, you have to understand. I loved Rachel. It took me so long to get over her and then when all this came up, I just... I, I didn't know what to think. Do you still love her? Doesn't matter anymore. [April cries] [Voices whispering] [Ominous music] [Whispering continues] Rachel: Rest now, Sarah. You'll need your strength later. [Music continues] [Woman announcing] April: Uh. What time is it? Casey: Noon. Where are you going? Home. Get some clothes. Take a shower. I have to stop by work, too. Take care of some things. Cops are taking me. I'll go with you. One of us should stay. I'll be back later tonight. Then you can take a trip. Okay? April: Casey. Be careful. [Knocking] Knock knock nurse: Excuse me, Ms. Reilly. Yes. I got a call from the lobby. The guard says there's a man named Terry Morgan here to see you. Great. I-I'll be right there. [Elevator dings] Ding April: Terry. April, downstairs they got cops everywhere. Yeah, I know. Are you okay? Richard said you were here. Is your daughter alright? For now. Well, look. Where can we talk? You found something? Yeah. I found something. April, this is some spooky shit. Anne cassavettes. She's wanted by the FBI for murdering her husband. David cassavettes. Right. He was a doctor. About 20 years ago, he went looking for kids with telepathic potential. He brought about ten of them back to his colony in upstate New York. It was kinda like a, like school for the gifted. April: Hmm. Terry: He thought he could help them focus their abilities. Anyway, he worked up there for a while in secrecy. Then two years later, out of nowhere, his body washed up in the east river. He had been dead for months. She killed him. Right. Why? Well, the official story is that he was banging his assistant, a Russian girl. She worked with him at the school. They said Anne caught them in the act and she went nuts. After the murder, the girlfriend just disappeared. You said that's the official story. What's the unofficial story? Well, it's a lot of speculation, that stuff. Conspiracy theory, stuff like that. Tell me. Well, after Anne killed her husband and dumped the body, she took over the school. She started to accelerate the experiments. You know, giving them injections to stimulate their esp. She even thought that she could teach them to manifest their esp physically and then project it. April: Project it? Terry: Right. She even thought that she could absorb the projections for herself. If the kids ever questioned her, she just played it off like it was no big deal, you know. Tried to make it fun for them. You mean, like a game. Terry: Right. But no one really knows for sure what was going on up there. She was in control of the whole thing for like four months until her husband's body was found. When police went to arrest her, she was long gone. Someone must've tipped her off. April: What about the students? Terry: Dead or missing. Some murdered. They think cassavettes in involved, but there's no proof. The police couldn't find anything and no one has been able to find her. Did you ever find any mention of something called the echo game? Echo game? Mmm hmm. Well, echo is a term they use to, uh, refer to their abilities. It's like, uh, an aura inside of them that gives them their powers. Terry, I need to borrow this, okay? What? Look, you can borrow this. But if anyone asks, you did not get this from me. Deal. Thanks, Terry. Detective Mike Simmons, please. Could you tell him April Reilly called? I have some new information about my case. Yeah, thanks. Female #6: What are you doing here? I took off work. What are you doing? What does it look like? I'm leaving you, Terry. Leaving? What-what, what did I do? Your ex came by looking for you? My ex? [Bag zips] Zip! I remember you telling me about her. Skinny, white, twice your age. Hold on a minute. What are you talking about? I know your type. Anyway, this isn't the first time this happened. What do you mean? Two months ago. The phone messages. I'm not putting up with this anymore. Terry: Stacy, wait. Stacy: I made my decision. [Door slams] Slam! Shit! [Thump] Terry: What'd you forget? Your fucking toothbrush? * what do you think? A lot of this is conspiracy theories. The Internet is full of this stuff. It's not a very reliable source. It says here that cassavettes was trying to figure out a way to absorb their powers, their echoes. This one's a little outlandish. But think. What if maybe she did figure out a way? But before she could do it, she had to go on the run. Maybe that's why she's after the students. To steal their echoes. Or to cover up the experiments. Yeah. But either way, I think we have a pretty good idea why they're after Rachel. Which is why we have to find her before they do. April. We got a call from the San Francisco p.D. They found Rachel's body. She's been dead for at least a week. No. I'm so sorry. Sarah said she saw her yesterday. Mike: There's a lot happening that we can't explain. Well if Rachel's dead, then what the hell do they want? Look, you haven't gotten a lot of sleep. Why don't I take you home for a while? We can watch the house while you rest. That might be a good idea. [Phone rings] Ring! Yeah, it looks good. I'll get that. Just give them an email and tell them to come pick it up tomorrow. You gentlemen alright? Can I get you a soda or anything? Gore girls. Hey, it's me. Casey: Hey. I'm just finishing up here so I can come over and relieve you in a while. Okay. Um, i'm, I'm just gonna head out now then. The cops are taking me. Sure. How's Sarah? April: She's sleeping. Casey, Rachel's dead. She died a week ago. They just told me. I'm sorry, hon. Are you doing alright? I'm just so confused. I can't make sense of any of this. You don't have to make sense of it now. Just get some rest. Casey? I'm sorry. I feel like I betrayed your trust. I didn't mean to. I just know I never want to have this feeling again. I love you. I love you too. We'll talk later then? Casey: You got it. * [sighs] * Casey's coming, hon. See you soon. * [voices whispering] Casey. Well, I'm gonna get going. Sure you don't need help with inventory? Casey: No, I got it. You go ahead. Okay, take care of yourself. Casey: Thanks. [Door creaks] Creak [thunder rumbles] Hey. She'll be out in a minute. Male #3: I'll walk her to her car. Be right back. [Dreary music] [Thunder rumbles] Mmph! [Music continues] Casey: Ugh! Where is she? Find her! [Music continues] Oh. Oh! Oh! Ahhh! Ah! Ahh! [Door slams] Slam! Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahh! Nurse. She's hysterical. No, Casey! Get off of me! No, Sarah. Sarah. Ahhh! Ahhh! You're gonna hurt yourself. It's alright. Ahh! No, there you go. There you go. It's alright. It's alright. Shh. * [thunder rumbles] Aaargh! Gus! What are you doing? You looked tense. Stop it. You're gonna wake up the patients. If we get loud enough, we might. But. I have to watch the desk. Nobody's coming. The place is on lockdown. What makes you think you can have your way with me whenever you want? I don't. But, you can have your way with me whenever you want. You know that, right? Who says I want to? Okay, you win. [Heavy breathing] Wait! Gus: What? Nurse: It's the girl's other mom. She's allowed up here. Just, just go. This'll just take a second. Wait, come here. Hold that thought. Rachel: Sarah. Sarah, hide. They're coming for you. What if they find me? Rachel: They won't. I'll help you. I'm not leaving you. Hurry. Nurse: Hi, miss lin. Welcome back. Is everything okay? * your daughter had another fit again earlier. But I think she's sleeping again now so. * you remember which room it is, right? Um, well here. I'll show you. * nurse: Sarah? [Ominous music] Anne: No! [Music continues] Hey kid. What's goin' on? Watch out! Ahhh! Anne: Don't be afraid, child. I just want the echo. You can't hide from us. [Ominous music] I will find you. [Thunder rumbles] Sounds like there's a storm coming. I think it's a little ways off yet. [Sighs] Trouble sleeping? Mmm. [Thunder rumbles] That's understandable. How do you do it? I mean, deal with this sort of stuff every day. How do you sleep at night? Not well. But it comes with the job. You ever feel like you've had enough? Some days. But quitting isn't gonna help you. Doing your job is the only thing that makes you feel better. Thing is, the more you do it, the more death you see. It's a never-ending cycle. Well, I appreciate everything. Shh! [Thunder rumbles] Isn't one of your men out there? Frank? Sarah? Sarah, what on earth are you doing here? Mom, Casey's dead. What? They killed Casey. Then they came to the hospital to get me. Who? The teacher. She wants the echo. Frank! * oh my god! Upstairs. Sarah: Ahh! Now! * April: Come on Sarah! Get out of sight. I'll take care of this myself. [Door bangs] Bang! Mike: Freeze! Don't move. I said don't move! Or I will drop you where you stand! Then get on with it. * [voices whispering] [Gasping] Sarah. I want you to go hide for me, okay? Don't let them find you, okay? You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be alright. Mom! Okay? Please don't. Go, go, go. Ugh! Ugh! [Gasps] [Voices whispering] Now, where are you? [Voices whispering] Upstairs! [Ominous music] [Bat striking] Whomp! Whomp! Whomp! Whomp! [Music continues] [Footsteps] Got you. You're coming with me. [Voices whispering] [Panting] [Bat strikes] Whomp! * [whispering continues] [Gasps] [Bat strikes] Whomp! Unh! Unh! Unh! [Gun fires] Bang! [Panting] April: Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Sarah honey, come here. Come on. We have to go. Baby, we have to go. Come on. Oh god. Come here, honey. Come here. Please get up. Please, please. Come here. Hold on to me, okay? Okay, good girl. Good girl. Oh god. Sarah: [Whimpering] Okay honey. I need you to keep your eyes closed for me, okay? Sarah: Okay. Okay. Sarah: [Whimpering] Keep 'em closed tight. [Panting] Shh! Keep your eyes closed, baby. Okay, you can look. Shh. Unh! Mom? [Gasping] [Voices whispering] See how easy it is, child? With only the slightest effort, you could turn a person this way... Or that. Stop it! * I might've been able to teach you a thing or two with this gift your mother gave you. But I'm afraid I can't let you keep it. I've been searching for it for so long. Stop! You're hurting her! Hush now. You'll get your turn. [Gasping] * [voices whispering] What? [Whispering continues] Oh-ho-ho-ho. Don't even try it. [Whispering continues] Have it your way! [Intense music] [Screaming] [Music continues] You can't. [Music continues] Ahh! Ahh! * Sarah. Sarah. Oh god. Did you see her? Yeah. Sweetheart, I did. * Casey: You should've told me about the letter. Why didn't you? April: I loved Rachel. It took me so long to get over her. And then when all this came up, I just, I didn't know what to think. Casey: Do you still love her? April: Doesn't matter anymore.
