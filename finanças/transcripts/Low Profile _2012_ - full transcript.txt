LOW PROFILE WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY CÃ‰CILIA ROUAUD Excuse me, sir. Can I take those cartons? I'm moving. I could use them. Want to see each other again? I'm married. Did I tell you? She left me. About five years ago. Her name's Eve. Awful name... I should have been suspicious. She broke my heart. Broken. See what I mean? We had two daughters. Well, she had two daughters with me. Not exactly the same. She walked out on all of us to go live in Thailand. She took off with this great guy who could cook with lemon grass. To live her life "as a real woman." With that sucker who could cook with lemon grass. But she sends us DVDs. Nice... I'm going. All alone... I have no desires. My daughters hate me. That's only natural. They hate me now. They think I abandoned them but... That's not it. I can't get out of bed in the morning. But don't go! Don't go. I'm the one who's leaving. I'm moving to Brittany. I love Brittany. Good morning! You really should lock your bike. I know. -Aren't you afraid it'll be stolen? -Yeah. I'll take responsibility. Let me know if you need any help packing. I love packing. It's true! I love packing. Won't you get bored in Brittany? In Paris, you've got movies, museums, bars, a whole social life. I don't have many friends here yet but I love it! -When do you plan on moving? -During All Saint's Day vacation. Are you taking your daughters? No. They don't live with me. They're with their mom... No again. So you're not taking them? Please, stop with the questions. I'm a chatterbox, I know. When I was little, the kids at school called me "Shut Up." Not all of them. But quite a few. I'd say, "That's not my name." But they'd say, "Shut up, Shut Up!" Good morning! Well... I hope you had a nice weekend. Because we're doing subject complements. And they're not too glamorous. Don't worry, we'll get through it. -Yes, Martial. -What does glamorous mean? Yellow. It means yellow. So complements... Are you okay? I'm sorry. Let me sit. Okay, I'm better. -Thank you. -Sure. Oh, hi! Ariane, it's Dad! You could ask him in! You okay, Yvan? You're in costume! Great! Come in. I'm swamped. Wipe your feet. Great. You know me! Come in, come in. Wait! Wait. Can you do it again? -What? -Your feet. -How many? -Seven. Seven? Hi, Lucien! Good. You came, Zorro! Stop. It's a thing from when I was little. I thought Ariane would laugh but she doesn't remember. Or doesn't care. -You know how she is. -I know. You scared me! Do you always have to pop up like that? Be nice and don't throw up on my bed. You okay? Think people are having a good time? -Everything's fine. -Say it, please! Everything's fine. People are having a good time. -And Leo? -He's asleep in the back room. You have to talk to Yvan. No, not tonight. Say, "Not tonight." Not tonight. It's cold out! I came to pick you up by bus. I got you some boxes. I'll help myself... I guess you know there's a dead fish in your sink. If you'd rather not talk, we won't talk. I don't mind. Now I'll tell you what I had to say. You know, when Eve left you... When she got pregnant with... with that man. Yeah, thanks. I remember. That explains the Thai restaurant! Clever. -Sorry. That wasn't on purpose. -It's fine. -You believe me? -I do. -Say, "I believe you." -I believe you. Okay. She had a little boy. His name's Leo. He's almost five. I really don't give a damn. Listen to the rest! I'm trying to say that Eve came back from Thailand. It didn't go too well with Leo's dad. He wasn't much of a boss... Cut it short, please. In short, she came back with the boy. Then she left again without him and... She left him in Paris. Where? -What? -Where in Paris? With Claire. With her sister, Claire. So what's the problem? What does that have to do with me? You want to take him, is that it? You want the boy? You know Claire. She works a lot, she's so busy... You want to take him into your home? Yeah, for example. That'd be good. Why not? I'll try to be clear. Over my dead body. You hear me? How could you have even imagined for one second... In a nutshell, my answer is no. Let's move on. It's unthinkable. He is their brother, after all. Their half-brother. You're out of your mind! Damn it, Ariane! After what that woman... I can barely... And you want to take in her kid? Okay. -Okay? -Yes. -You say yes, but don't mean yes. -I do. You don't mean yes. Yes, I do. I don't believe it! You've got no right! This isn't your home! Please, Daddy! He's got a family. I'll never do my homework again! I'll ruin my future! And I'll cut off a lock of my hair every day! Shut up! Who cares about your hair? I'm not a nice guy. I know. You do what you know how to do. You react. But just one thing... You can't turn back after this. I won't let you. I protect them. That's what I know how to do. Understand? Claire! Open up! It's Yvan. I haven't seen you in five years, so you must have a good reason for waking me with a little boy and looking so angry. I'm bringing him back. I refuse to let Ariane raise him. -What are you talking about? -Don't lie to me! You either! What are you talking about? You don't know, is that it? That's it. Nothing? Yvan, I'd love to chat but I have an early meeting. I have to be up in five hours. -So either explain or disappear. -He's Eve's son. She doesn't want him. She left him with Ariane. I thought you knew. Now he's yours. They say he's nice. Eve left him with Ariane, not me. Why are you butting in? She acts crazy and leaves us her crap, one more time! Damn it! Take him or I'll leave him on your doorstep. I can't take care of him. Are you dying? Otherwise, you're taking him. I'm in the process of adopting a child. I've been waiting six years. Here's your miracle. No more waiting. What are you doing? I've got no choice! -Open the damn door! -Take him back to your sister. You can't do this to me! I'm going back to bed. I'll call you! So you knew I'd come back? Were you waiting for me? What are you? Some magician? I just have trouble sleeping sometimes. I sort of blew a fuse. I'm sorry. I know you said not to come back but I've got no other solution. For the moment. I'll find one. But not right away. You'll have to keep him for another week or two. Then things will go back to normal. Even a week will be fine. Say something, please. The girls are sleeping in Ariane's bed. They're all sleeping together. They cried a lot. And finally they fell asleep. I said I'm sorry. -Leo's sleeping, too, right? -Yeah. We should let them sleep. Let them sleep. What do you mean, "Let them sleep"? You sending me home? With him? Either he stays for good or he leaves for good. No way. Never. Screw her! That's the address of his school. And that's his stuff. Thanks. Great. You know how to go in alone. Sorry! You're the guy from junior high! My name's Emmanuelle. Remember me? The girl who falls. -And what's your name? -Yvan. You have kids here? No, I'm just dropping off a friend's son. Well, I've got to go. Okay, see you soon maybe. -Sorry. -Watch it dumb ass! You're the dumb ass! She's crazy! You scared me! You're so nervous! I just didn't see you. What are you doing here? I'm going to 302. Why? Why do you think? I'm a teacher. Fine arts. I give classes here. With students. I'm replacing a fat lady who died. -Know where it is? -What? Room 302. -It's, uh... You take... -You're upset. It's strange. We never see each other and now twice. It's a sign, you're right. Third floor, next to the library. Great. Would you not mention me here? Excuse me? The school this morning, the little boy... Can that stay between us? Sure, if you like. Don't say anything. Okay? -Yeah, okay. -Okay? I said okay. -Composition! -No! Yes! Put your things away and write two pages on... Josephine! What are you doing there? I didn't do my homework, so I can't sit in on class. We'll deal with that later. That's it, yeah. What did you say? Nothing. You're very late. Are you the daddy? No, I'm the babysitter. But not for long. You never say anything. You're right. If you've got nothing to say. It doesn't really suit me. But you're right. I don't believe this! Is it too cold? How's this? Hold on. -You can't tell. -Because of the layers. Change your mind. I'm not changing my mind. It's over. Forget that story. I'm sorry. About your hair. Got 40 euros? To buy something. Find something for twenty. Can you drop me off? -You're not alone. -No. She's big, she won't drown! I've got to go. Get home safely. But... These were mine. When I was little. They're toys for boys. Arlette, do you want a sword? I'll put it there, in case Arlette changes her mind. -You like them? -They're great. Thank you, Ariane. Yeah. Thank you, Ariane. We may not be rich but you can still look cute. I went to see Dad. I gave him my hair. -What did he say? -That you can't tell. About Leo, idiot! Manon, be nice, please. He didn't say anything. He said he won't change his mind. What a jerk! Try to understand. Try to understand? Because he's in pain? You don't know what she meant to him. It's not my fault he fell for that loon. You don't believe that. Your mom's not a loon. Your dad's not a bastard. He was crazy about her. Crazy! We all loved her. A lot. We love her a lot. A lot, lot, lot. But him... I know he's had a hard time but he's getting there. Have faith in him. Have faith in him? It's been five years. It's pathetic. The guy's pathetic. Look, it's unraveling all by itself. Eat! Arlette's really pissing me off. Eat or I'll get mad. Then get mad. -Going to school? -Yeah. -Give me a ride? -Okay. Wait for me? That's Sona, my nanny's daughter. She's sick, so I'm watching her today. Sure, that's logical. And him? He's mine. I have him because my nanny's... Sick. Exactly. His name's Basile. And I have a daughter, Plume. Plume? That's pretty, Plume. And she's not too heavy? No, she's fine. Do you have kids? No. No, not me. Well, I have two daughters but... They're big. It's not the same. Why isn't it the same? Because it's not the same. -Want us to get out? -No. No, stay. Doesn't it smell like pastis? Yeah, that's my anti-lice shampoo. Do you want to smell? -Anyway, it works. -What? The shampoo. I don't want to be too blunt but I feel a sort of sexual tension between us. That's not being blunt? Do you want to have a drink together tonight, to see? -Why are you here? -I came to see Leo. He's not here. Let's talk later, please. I want to see him. He's not here, I said. You're gonna get me in trouble. That's the guy from the adoption agency. And you show up, asking for your brother! Sorry. But where's Leo? He left. With your mother. When? Last night? This morning. I put him on a plane. I'm sure he's here. Don't do this now, Manon. I'll call you. I'll call you as soon as I hear anything. But don't come back without calling first, okay? Yeah, sorry. Josephine, may I see you, please? Do you feel better now? I read the note you left in my locker. You can't write me things like that... about love. I'm your teacher and you're twelve. Damn it. Do you mind if he doesn't talk much? No, it's funny. He doesn't talk at all. Is he mute? -You've got nothing against dolls? -No. Of course not. I'm single and not in great shape. Hello. Do you dance Saturday night, tonight Is your schedule flexible? Any more stupid questions? It's a story about a daddy who comes home late at night and his little girl is sad. Then one night he surprises her and comes home early. I know how to use electric burners, gas stoves, microwaves, ovens. I can make Alsatian pizza. Education? Well, that's what schools are for. Thank you, goodbye. Good luck. It's tough with that doll. Leo! -Why aren't you in school? -It's tough with that doll! -What? -How perverted are you? You disgust me. -It's disgusting. -Let me explain. Don't try to justify yourself. You make me sick. I don't believe this! Don't you have better things to do? With guys your own age? Can you start tonight? The men's room, please? Hello? Yes? Why under the bed? No big deal, he'll come out eventually. I don't know! Tempt him with candy. -I'm sorry. -That's okay. A draft, please. I'm in a hurry, thanks. -How are you? -I'm fine. The waiter just spilled coffee all over me then you scream that you're in a hurry to go. That's all kind of humiliating but... I'm sorry. It's okay. Why are you in a hurry? -I just have a thing to do. -What? It's nothing, just... It's weird to be so insistent. What's weird is having so many secrets. You're kind of stubborn. Wouldn't you rather tell me your life story? No. Not really. You keep looking at your watch. You're rushed but won't say why. I'm kind of disappointed. I thought it would be more magical. But it is magical. Very, very magical. Tell me about yourself. What does the father of your kids do? He's dead. Damn it. I'm sorry, I didn't know. No, don't be sorry. Nobody's dead. It was a joke. There are two. Two fathers. One for each kid. They're both kind of odd. Each in his own way. And it's much better without them. Ever since, I've sworn of crazy guys. It was a good decision, I think. I'm sticking to it. Well, I'm trying to stick to it. You can answer. You're gonna go anyway. No, no. I mean I'd prefer if you go. It's no good for me to be here with you. If I'm trying to swear off... strange people. Because I know myself. I fall in love, I have a baby and then things get really complicated. Not magical at all. But it's not your fault. You're you. It's me. I can't take guys like you anymore. I'm not usually strange. It's just a temporary thing. It's got nothing to do with you. You're very beautiful. You're very beautiful. And I'm not crazy. Can you go now? I'm really sorry. I couldn't do anything. He's so... weird. No, he's not weird. You all think everything's "weird". -You okay? -Fine. I'm not counting anymore, see? I'm just looking at you. You've got beauty marks. -How many? -I don't know. Seventeen! Luc. Luc? I love you. You're a pain with that! I love you, love you, love you, love you... This is the first reason I wanted to see you, Yvan. We found it on the table in the teacher's lounge. You should have told me. Yeah, I know. Martine showed up just when... I didn't call you in to discuss it but to give you a sermon. So, listen up, keep quiet, leave this room, do what I say and we'll still be friends. -OK? -OK. I said you should have told me. That's the procedure. I'm not done. The second thing is... you gave back homework that was soaked in alcohol. Parents weren't happy. No, but that... The third thing, your daughter, Manon, is kicking up a lot of crap in junior high. I saw her pasting anti-drug fliers in the gym. I don't know what's going on at home. I don't give a damn! But if you want to keep that job in Brittany, get your thumb out of your ass. Excuse my vulgarity, but it relaxes me. Things are different in private school. I'm done. You can go. Sorry about the noise, they're out of control. -Want me to calm them down? -I'd love it, thanks. -And do me a favor, in exchange. -Sure, I love doing... I need you to watch a four or five-year-old kid. Yeah, sure. Whose kid? -I'll calm them, no questions. -Okay, no questions. Is it your son? At least two steps away. I'm sorry about yesterday. What's that? Children's theater. I'm a clown. On Wednesdays. You're a clown on Wednesdays? Stop flirting with me. I know you're crazy now. I'm not crazy. My life's just unsettled at the moment and... Okay? Stay there. I'm going to walk by. I'm leaving. And you let me go. That's it. Great. Thanks. I'm not crazy. Okay, you're not crazy. You fight yourself, that's all. I fight myself... Nonsense. What's wrong? I want to live with the Little Brown Bear. That's impossible. Why? He doesn't exist. It's a cartoon. -He doesn't exist. -Yes, he does. -No. -Yes. No, I said. Papa Bear is nicer than you. That's easy. He lives in Bearland where everybody's nice. Nobody gives him a hard time at home. His cub makes him pies. -Is that the life you want? -Yeah. -You're little. You don't know. -Yes, I do. -I rang but... -Seriously, what time is it? 8:15 a.m. You said... My ninth graders are much better since you intervened. I never had natural authority. When I was little, my mom said I was too nice. "Too sweet, too dumb." How can anybody be too nice? Nice is good! It's never too much. Is it? I don't know. No. Is there stuff I should know? What does he eat? Does he take a nap or... Call me, okay? It'll be fine! Boycott the cafeteria. -What are you doing? -A strike. -I'm organizing a cafeteria boycott. -Why? Junk food. -You don't care, you're right-wing. -What? Nothing. Be careful what you say. I didn't say anything. OK. I'm your father and I order you to stop all revolutionary activity on the premises. I'd rather die. -You're still on strike? -Yeah. -What do you want exactly? -Bring Leo back. -I don't have him. -I know. Get him and bring him back to us. He's with his aunt. He's fine. It's over. No, it's not over. She lied. She won't let us see him. Get him back, save my future and Elise's hair. That's not gonna happen. I know. You're incapable. You can't do anything. -So you're doing this for nothing? -Yeah. -Despite what I said? -Exactly. Even though we both know it's useless? -Completely. -Just to give me a hard time? Yeah. -Fine. -Fine. -Bye. -Bye. This is the last time... -More! -Stop now... Yes, more! More! More! Okay, but then we're done. Simon! Oh, hi. It's bad to get him all excited before eating. I didn't really have a choice. He's weird, isn't he? You can't handle a five-year-old kid and he's weird? Hello. Glad to see you as an egg. You do like me. It's got nothing to do with you. Women dressed as eggs turn me on. I have the kid today, I thought he'd like it. Good! Can I see you afterward? Yes. YOUR CAR'S ON THE STREET. WHERE ARE YOU? Why are you in this neighborhood? I'm taking a stroll. Really? You hate strolls. In the country. In Paris, I like them. It depends. It depends on with whom. Where's your new girl? And him? Who's he? Arnaud, my sweetheart. We met during Handicap Week. And don't try to con him, he's deaf. "Deaf" deaf? Totally. We have to talk, Elise. I have students, some of them are girls. It happens. Just don't go off the deep end. And what about Leo? We'll hate you forever. Especially Manon. I know. Why especially Manon? What do you think? I don't think. I'm like my mother. This means "love." -Or "to love." -Great. I've really got to go. Bye. See ya. Dad, I have something to tell you. I went off the pill because Arnaud and I want to have a baby. What? I went off the pill to have a baby. -No. -Yes. -No. -Yes. Damn it, Elise. -What are you doing now? -We're going... I'll give you a ride. It's cold out. No... -It's not cold. -Yes, it is cold. Dad, I know what you're gonna say. Elise, you're eighteen. You've known Arnaud for what? A week? -Six days. -Six days isn't enough. We're in love, that's all that matters. No, it's not. How are you gonna raise this baby? And Arnaud's deaf. That's fine, but it's not a career. Understand? I don't see the connection. This piece of crap! Simon, it's Yvan. Yeah, fine. Are you at school? Can you find me the name of a teacher? An art teacher? She's new. Her name's Emmanuelle. Thank you, ma'am! -Are you Emmanuelle's grandmother? -She said... not to talk to you. To wait for you and then leave. Tell her I'm sorry. Is she scared? I'm no good. No one's spoken or looked at one another for 27 minutes now. What? Take out the earplugs, too. I really respect you both. I understand your combat, Manon. I'm 100% with you, Elise, in your deafness immersion project so you can empathize with your friend. But I need some consideration too! So now we talk! Your dad called earlier. He can't come for coffee. He's not taking you this weekend. He has to go to his house in Brittany to prepare... to prepare his burial. Don't say that. You have to respect his choice, okay? What kind of nonsense is that? You're too nice! He doesn't care about anybody! "Respect his choice," my ass! Be polite. Luc's right. Let's respect each other! Elise, Dad also mentioned what you plan to do with Arnaud... The baby. And I totally agree with him. It's much too soon. Listen, Ariane, I love you but I can't conceive of a life without a child. It's too horrible. To me, it's like being dead. -What did I say? -Nothing, honey. It's you, Bernardo. Yeah, more hair, I imagine. I'd love to chat, Bernardo, but I can't. I'm packing. Tell Elise she can shave her head. It won't change a thing. Understood? And while you're here... Just try getting my daughter pregnant and I'll unplug both yours ears. With a sword. Take off. Take off! Aren't you scared of getting caught? Smoking's against the rules. I know. It seems you always refuse a helping hand. -Like yours? -Yes. Great. Got 1,000 euros? Do you have problems? -Because of the boy? -Drop it! Who is that kid? You can tell me. I know him now. He's my wife's son. You mean she had a son with another man and you're taking care of him? Technically, you're taking care of him. What's the matter now? -Why take care of him? -I have no choice! Are you trying to get her back by using her son? That's dumb! It'll never work! No, I'm trying to get rid of the kid so I can forget her. You see? It's the opposite. And you're taking him to Brittany? Nobody knows but you. Don't say a word. Why not talk to your daughters? Because they'll want the impossible. And they're demonic! What? Arlette's cold. Where's your mommy? She's dead. You like this house? Yeah. I'm gonna live here. I'll like it here. But it stinks. It doesn't stink. Why'd you say that? -It doesn't stink. -It does stink. If you want to say it stinks, go ahead. But it doesn't. What are you doing? Let's go. I called you in today because Josephine... I'm not sure if she should be here. Yes, she should be here. I won't let you talk nonsense about my daughter. Well... Josephine left a love letter in my locker. And whenever I speak she faints. Josephine! What did you do to her? Class. I taught a class. -Don't try me. -You're a little tense. It's not my fault she's a mess. Crap! No, it's not you. Thank God. -Does it hurt? -Yeah. It's just not my day. Why'd you hit me? I don't know. I rarely hit people but now I felt like I had to defend myself. If you had to. Listen to me very carefully. It's not normal that people hit you. If people do that to you, it's very serious. Hello. -Are you Leo's dad? -No. The teacher said it was his birthday. Are you having a little party? No again. It's from Claire. Your mom sent you a message on DVD. You want to watch it? You want to watch it? HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MY LOVE Happy birthday, my little boy! Look at the sea. Look at the world, my little boy. Look at the sea. Happy birthday. Ready? Now, go! Wait! Turn, turn, turn, turn! That is! Again. Did I wake you? That's okay. I love surprises in the middle of the night. I just came to tell you that... my life's kind of confused at the moment. But... You interest me. A lot. You interest me a lot. I'm interested in you, your voice, your smile - that all interests me. Even at night. I didn't really expect all this and... It's sort of... But I have no choice. You're gonna let me just keep talking? No, but I really like compliments. So I'm relishing them. Do you want to come in? Oh, crap! -Don't you have the keys? -No. But your kids are in there. Plume! Shall we call a locksmith? We may have a long wait but... 06 62 75 39 03. I have a good memory for numbers. You're swimming. You're wriggling. You're a salmon with hair. A trout. A goby. You're crazy. You're crazy. A mental hospital! No, we said an event. The opening of a mental hospital. You're backing up, stretching out. A horse. A horse. Beep-beep! The 100-meter dash. The 200-meter dash. 100, 300, 600-meter dash... One thousand... You're... a wheel. Track and field! A track and field competition. You have something on your back. Robin Hood! You're sculpting sand. Sand pies! Are you crying? Crying with melted ice cream. You're saying goodbye. You lost the competition. You're France. You're hypnotizing people. Five times. The Olympics! You're hot. You're very hot. -The Summer Olympics! -Yes! It was the Summer Olympics. You had a hard time! A movie. Yeah, I know it's hard. Can you do anything for this? A subject, a quality, a state... Ariane. Bad timing. Granny Belote's dead. We're having the wake. Hi, Leo! Remember me? I don't know what to do. What should I do? Stay this time. I didn't know. It's okay. I sort of feel like I'm on trial. I don't understand. Did he have Leo all along? You have to be here more, Yvan. Yeah, I know. You want to see her? -Who? -Granny Belote. No, thanks, that's okay. I'm fine as I am. She's very beautiful. She's mostly very dead. Yeah, of course, she's dead. Where's Leo? You're attached to him. You didn't want him and now... I was wrong. I was scared at first, when I found out he was with you. You knew? I called Claire to see how he was... And the girls? No, I obviously didn't say a word. Why not? Because I love you. I respect you. Don't say stuff like that, okay? Where is he? Leo. Leo! Hello! Everything's fine. I'll be going now. He's exhausted. He's resting in his room. I'm going home to correct some papers. Thanks, bye. Thank you. -You okay? -Yeah. Is that your son? Yes. I just got back from Madagascar. His name's Fano. It means "gift." He's letting off steam. I'm letting him. Anyway, he doesn't speak French yet, so... Did you come for Leo? -Do you have a room for him? -What? Does he have his own room? No, they're sharing. I bought a little mattress. -You bought what? -A mattress. Anyway, I think you should think about channeling his energy into... Fano? Are you giving me advice? No, I'm just afraid it won't go well. -What? -I'm afraid it won't go well. Don't worry, it'll be fine. Okay, I'll be going. No, Fano, be careful! I found you! As you may know, Mr. Le Doze is leaving us to move to Brittany. If you're not interested, Victor, just don't listen. So we wish him a good trip. And we welcome Miss Luc, who was brave enough to leave her home in Picardy to come here and teach you. -That could have waited. -No, this is better. I'm leaving tomorrow. Early. -Everything okay? -With whom? You. Yeah. Great. I'll be going. Feel like going for a beer? I have to get to bed. I have water aerobics tomorrow. -Simon? -Yes? -Are you gay? -No, why? I don't know. It seems like it sometimes. Apparently. But no. I'd have told you, after all this time. In fact, we haven't talked much since we met. But it was me, I... I didn't think you liked me much. Liked you... No. But being friends... I should have. You're a nice guy. I know. No, that's not what I mean. Guys like you are important. Thanks. We can call each other. Okay. Bye. Anyway, I feel like... this is the time to cut myself off. Really. To live without pressure. I'm moving to Brittany. For good. Brittany's beautiful. So I can't ask people to get attached to me. Understand? So that complicates things for us. Yes. You don't want anymore? I feel queasy. -May I? -Go ahead. Are we having dessert? This is the first time I'm seeing you. You're handsome in real life. You may be disappointed but I have to go now. I have to pick up the kids at the nanny's. I'm six hours late. Hello, I'm Emmanuelle. I came to drop off the car. Come in, miss. Can I call you Emmanuelle? I'd prefer it. Can you stay a while? Yeah, I have time now. Plume's at school and Basile's with Plume's father. I kept his cat for a year, so... Really? That's nice! I'll make some tea. Have a seat. Sorry. I'm clumsy. No big deal! I'll straighten them up later. Everything's fine. Have a seat. Do you want to see Yvan when he was little? Yeah, I love kids! Thank you. I'd love a little tea with my water. But I can do it, if you like. I'm sorry, I'm kind of tired. Is it because of all the additional things you do? It's certainly because of that. When I was little, on my way to school, I thought I had to kneel down every seven steps. Then it was every five steps. Then every three steps. When it went down to every step, it took me 35 minutes to get from my house to the school. I was incredibly late. The next day, my mom took me in a shopping cart. -A shopping cart? -Yeah, a shopping cart. Every day I went to school in a cart. Don't you want to sit with me? In the end, I'll have my hot water plain. I like your house. It's too late but I'm happy he met you. If we're talking about him, I'd like a cigarette. I don't smoke but I always carry some, just in case. Good thing. You want one? No, I don't smoke either. What better occasion? Here! At first, I thought he was crazy. But still, I liked him a lot. I like him a lot. But it's really hard to tell with him. He's been sad for so long, he cuts himself off. You've never been mad at him? I don't think so. That's hard, too! Being mad at him. Hello? It's too bad you're not there. Because I had some things to say. Do you see where I'm at now? See where I'm at? I can't be any further from you. I'm as far from you as I can be. Yet you're all here with me. It stinks here. Did it stink when we were little? Do you remember that? Let him talk for once. I don't exist, in fact. Without you all, I don't exist. I'm Topo Gigio. Remember that puppet? Does anyone remember Topo Gigio? But a mean, creepy Topo Gigio. A pathetic Topo Gigio. An ugly Topo Gigio. I'm bored stiff here. I want to throw up. I'm gonna hang up. I'm gonna hang up to throw up. You're the one who has to talk. It'll be hard, cold like that. And sober. That's taken care of. I had a drink. Shall I try anyway? I wanted to say that I'm launching myself into a sort of fresh start, family-wise. I want to get my daughters back. And take in their little brother. I want to stop... Complaining. That's not necessarily what I was gonna say, but that too. Sorry? You want to stop what? I want to stop pretending like nothing touches me. That's not true. Lots of things do. I'd like you to be a part of that fresh start. Because... you get me to say all that on Monday morning at nursery school. And also because, ever since we first met, you don't know how you can live without me. That, too. We don't have to talk anymore. Close your eyes. It's good, what you're doing. Two is too much. I'm not twenty anymore. Plus they're sort of... Both of them! Not one more than the other... No! Don't do that! No, no! Come on. You have to put stuff away, too! Hi. Arlette's sleeping. Okay. You want to see her? No, I don't want to wake her. I'll go get her. You know, I was sort of sad all alone. And I had an idea. I thought to myself that it'd be good if you and Arlette could come back to live with me for real. I was a jerk and I apologize. I'd really like you to come back. Can Mimi come with us? Yeah, I think so. Hi, Leo! I want to stay here. Great! With you, we never know whether to be happy. I'm gonna go get the... Their reaction's only natural. You pop up with your flower-power. You have to follow through. It is sort of a sudden reversal. But it's good! I'm happy, it's good. Sorry. Look! There's water everywhere and I didn't say a thing. That's wild. And if I did... that! -Couldn't care less. -Yeah? And if I did this? Stop! You're disgusting! See, you're not cured. Shampoo on the floor is officially disgusting. It's not just me! It's disgusting to everybody. Everybody! Everybody, everybody, everybody... You're a pain! Arnaud dumped me. Did you know? No. I asked if he could give me a ride one night. He made a sign that means "impossible." But I thought it meant "trumpet," so I burst out laughing. I think he was offended. I didn't understand but... Then he said we were all crazy. And I haven't seen him since. That's dumb. There are other deaf guys. I'm happy to see you. Well, you live here, Dad. You know, when you were little, you'd look up at me every morning... Stop right now or I'll scream. What do I have to do? Dad, one day you decided not to be our father anymore. We're gonna need like ten years of analysis to get over that. I didn't think I'd know how to do it. Without her. I was wrong. And I'll pay... for the analysis. But from now on, we have to talk about her. -About Mom. -We'll see. No, we won't see. She's our mother. We won't see. I'm going. If you're paying, we can go to the movies one day. For the rest, frankly, you'd better hang in there. Come here. Subtitling: Hiventy
