Hello. - Sir, it's time. What? - For Dinner. Shall I serve it? - No. I am not hungry. Sir, are you.. - I am okay. You go sleep. - Yes. Sleep peacefully if you want! Because I am awake! No matter how hard sensations try to spear through the silence, We won't let you scream... We have a sharp eye on every news every hour. Right now, a killer is roaming this city.. ..who looks sober, but is ruthless by nature. He might be advancing towards your house in a red car. He enters the house.. ..when the owner of the house exits. Chakradhar, sir! Feels like you simply jumped out of the television. Do you really not sleep? - That's the point. I stay awake even when I am sleeping. Where's Samrat? - I don't know. After 11 ½ cups of coffee and 1 ½ cigarette.. ..and he suddenly left. He's been murmuring 'Fed up Fed up' since morning. Fed up! Oh...that's the point. Now I know where he is ... and why? Fight. Come on, come on, hit me. Move aside. Move aside. Move, move. 100 for 10. Stop all this. - 100 for 10. Stop this fight between a rhino and a rabbit. This game will stop only after one of the two is dead. The rate's 100 for 10. You bet too! Move aside. Move. Christopher! Come on. Fight. Its pay back time. Name: Christopher Barrett. Three times Heavy Weight champion. Unbeatable since 10 matches. 7 knockouts. Ego solid, but breakable. Strong point: Right leg, right punch and eyesight. Weak point: Abdomen. Recently been operated. And now... the four steps of success. First: Tell his ego to go to he**. And his anger will drag him along. Second: Attack his strong point. Everything's fair in love and war.. ..because there's no second prize in both. Now for the third degree. Even zero degree ice.. ..can't soothe the pain of my third degree. And losers always face this brunt. One. - Come on, come on, come on. Two. Three. Four. Out. And that's a knock out! Knock out! And the winner is Samrat Tilakdhari!! Friends, the next match is between famous kick boxer Rajesh Marathe.. ..and five time body-building champion Martin D'souza. The match starts in 15 minutes. The betting has started. Excuse me. Your prize money. You know where to deliver it. You always donate your prize money in charity. Any special reason? Madam, even reason doesn't reason with STD. STD? - Samrat Tilakdhari. What question was bothering you today.. ..that you had to enter the ring? The answer to some questions.. ..are more questions. You and your Samrat-ism. You're offered so many cases why don't you pick one? They may be cases for you.. ..but to me they are an insult. What do you want me to? Find Rocky's doggy? Or..prove Mrs. Sharma's affair with Mr.Verma.. ..for suspicious Mr. Sharma. I wonder what case you're waiting for which is going to sweep u off your feet... This gorgeous lady who wears a red nail paint and red lipstick.. ..loves the color of red blood. Beware. Keep your eyes wide open. Is this lady stalking you? For now, Chakradhar bids you adieu. We'll meet again next week.. ..in 'Chakradhar's Chakravuyh' with a new story. The gorgeous lethal beauty?! - What? Red nail paint. Pink lipstick. This is confusing... What rubbish? Is this Samrat Tilakdhari's house? She's asking for the right person that means she isn't that girl. Yes, this is his house. Come in please. What did you say your name was? I didn't say that yet. I am saying it now. Dimpy Singh. Will you please call him? - Yes, yes, yes. Please take a seat. Don't be scared, it's dead. Skulls are more dangerous when they are alive. First the beautiful valleys of Shimla.. ..then the skies of Delhi.. ..and now Mumbai's traffic. The journey must have been tiring. Here. How did you guess? I think we're meeting for the first time? Do you need to meet someone to know them? And anyway, I don't know much about you. Except that you're the daughter of an aristocrat.. ..who lives in a town close to Shimla. Your morning starts with a cup of black coffee. You read the Hindustan Times. You used to wear glasses.. ..but recently you underwent a Laser Surgery. You've been in a relationship.. ..for more than six months.. ..and you're also confused. Not because the boy is poor, But because your family doesn't like him. But your reason for coming here.. ..is a family matter for which.. ..you can't approach the police. You don't want anyone to know anything.. ..not even that you're here. Your return flight's for today evening. And by the way, you play the guitar quite well. Right? How the he** How the he** did you guess that? Any 6th sense? - 7th. Samrat Tilakdhari. Dimpy Singh. So, Dimpy... how can I help you? It's an unusual mystery. - Mystery! That's the point. Then you rang the right doorbell. Because mysteries are his only friends. Only condition is that they should be confusing. But...before any mystery.. ..here's a sugar-free good news. 111 people now watch your show. No one can give you anything. No surprise, shock, happiness or any emotion. By the way, he is.. - I've seen him on television. 'Chakradhar's Chakravuy'. Right? - See. See. She's seen my show. I am the producer, director, writer, editor.. ..anchor.. - Satellite, and now except for 112 audiences, everything else. But my real introduction is that I am Watson. What son? Not what son, Watson. Sherlock Holmes, Watson. Actually, in his free time he lends me a hand. So you were mentioning some mystery. Yes. Oh yes. Actually, there's a huge garden in our bungalow. And for the past month.. ..all the trees and plants are slowly withering. That's the point. Madam, if Samrat grows you another garden.. ..what will the gardener do? It's like you're trying to learn maths from Shakespeare. Please hear me out. We approached the best gardeners and horticulturists. But no one could understand anything. We also conducted a forensic analysis of the mud. But there's no problem. And then...last week papa's horse suddenly died. And we couldn't find a reason for that either. Now tell me... How can I approach the police with such a strange case? First garden, then the horse. You mean first gardener and then a veterinarian. Actually, few months ago.. ..papa fired his oldest gardener. He was accused of stealing. And before leaving, that gardener bedamned us. I've raised this garden with my blood and sweat. And after I die...the plants and trees.. ..will slowly wither away. That will be the evidence of my innocence. And last week your gardener passed away. - Yes! Yes. And since then this string of misfortunes started. Everyone believes that his ghost... - Sorry, Miss. Dimpy. You've brought the wrong case to the right place. Not interested. CD...hail a cab for her. Listen. I'll give you the number of a witch-doctor. Father has not been keeping well. And the doctors say.. ..he has no physical illness. Does he believe in ghosts and spirits? Earlier he did not... But I guess now he does.. Because strange things are happening around him. He doesn't talk to anyone. He's scared all the time. The lights in his room stay on all night. Actually... papa's in the same condition as the garden. They both are withering away... Did that light a fuse?! Yes, brother. I am sorry I didn't inform you earlier. Yes. Actually he's with me. Okay, brother, I'll see you soon. You can ask me what you want to. Yes. I was wondering.. I mean...how does your 7th sense work? That 7th sense is called Samrat-ism. Samrat-ism? Einstein used only 11% of his brain. It's nothing but observation. Posh branded purse, glares, watch.. ..a sign of richness. But using it carelessly, a sign of aristocracy. Few days ago, my interview was published.. ..in Hindustan Times Delhi edition.. ..regarding the case I solved in Noida.. ..the article didn't have my phone number, but my address. So you didn't call, you came directly. Recently you underwent laser surgery. Your eyes are perfectly fine now. But still back in my house while reading the magazine.. ..habitually your fingers reached up to your forehead.. ..looking for your glasses. The fingers on your right hand are very beautiful. But the tips on your left hand fingers.. ..are a bit coarse, which is often what guitarists have. Excuse me, sir. Juice. - No, thanks. But I am from Himachal.. - The tag on your handbag. It showed that you took a flight from Shimla. When you were taking your mobile phone.. ..out of your purse, I noticed your car keys. Driving all the way to Shimla, without a driver.. ..meant you didn't want anyone to know.. ..about your trip and it's reason. And no luggage means, return flight in the evening. But the luggage could be in the hotel as well. - No ways. You were so eager to meet me.. ..that you didn't even wait at the airport. In fact, you touched up your lipstick in the taxi. And due to the road conditions of Mumbai.. ..it smudged a bit, and though you tried to clean it.. ..you couldn't. Okay. And... about my about relationship? Your phone. This mobile phone is like a blemish.. ..on your beautiful personality and it's 6 months old. And it's not a gift from any family member.. ..but a memorabilia of a struggler boyfriend.. ..because you still have it. And the scratches on it.. ..reveal your confusion about your relationship. I thought you were just guessing. I hate guessing. I love to be sure. Madam, his name...STD, has another meaning. 'Sharp Teekhi Drishti'. Meaning a piercing eyesight. Good evening, this is your captain Vikrant Parmar. We should be landing in the next 20 minutes. Shimla isn't too far now. There's something in the air... Definitely. Samrat. He's my eldest brother Sanjay Singh. Samrat. - Welcome, Samrat. Thank you. And that's.. - Your second brother Vijay Singh, and.. ..he'll make an unsuccessful effort to drive me away. Hari. - Yes, sir. Put his luggage back into the car. - Yes, sir. Brother. We don't need any detective here. Vijay, he's here to help us. Help... Do you also think we need a detective.. Fire! Fire! Come quickly. Get water. Fast! Hurry up! Quickly. Get more water quickly. Come on. Get water. Throw water quickly. Brother, careful. Hurry up! Throw the water. Throw the water, Shiv. There's an old truth that love, cough and crime are difficult to hide. But I can hide your secrets. What secrets? There's no smoke without fire, Mr. Vijay. The name of the gorgeous who's perfume you're smelling of.. ..or the jockey you secretly bet on... They can remain a secret. More water. Throw more water. What's going on here? I don't get it. I guess someone's jinxed this house. Half the servants have already fled fearing a ghost. And the rest.. Anyway, Vijay, you were saying that we.. No, brother...I.. I have no problem with him. Actually...I'm concerned about papa's reaction. No, no need to tell papa that he's a detective. He's Dimpy friend, and he's from Mumbai. William Shakespeare, Hamlet, Act 1 Scene 5. Oh... Dimpy told me about you. But she didn't say that... you're an encyclopedia. I apologize sir, I haven't read Hamlet. I just read the quotes along with the writers names.. ..on your bookshelf. Oh... Good speed. Sit. Do you know the story behind this pen? Plucked from a bird's wing and turned into a pen. Wrong. As a pen it made it's era immortal. It's a special antique. Invaluable. William Shakespeare used to write with this pen. Around 500 years ago. Can you imagine...Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello... Those famous sonnets.. ..they were all written with this. Those immortal... Anyway...to come back to the quote. The eyes see only what our mind knows. But with a request. You're here as a friend, so behave like one. Intelligent consulting private investigator.. ..Mr. Samrat Tilakdhari. Dimpy's version and the Mahendra Pratap we met.. ..are as different as chalk and cheese. And how did he know you're STD? From the same Hindustan Times article.. ..from where Dimpy got my address. It was on the top of the rack. Come, Samrat. Let me introduce you. Mr. Agnihotri. - Hello. Mr. Agnihotri, this is Samrat. Mr. Agnihotri is our horticulturist. Mr. Agnihotri, do you believe in ghosts? I didn't earlier. But now I feel that... ..where nature ends, the supernatural begins. She's my younger sister, Divya. "Life's filled with questions." She's been like this since her childhood. "It's hazy all around." Filled with a void. Lost in herself. She's also undergoing treatment. Psychiatric. "There's a fog all around." "There's a whisper." "Why does loneliness kindle a flame within?" This is a 2 week old recording. Some claim that they've seen this ghost with their own eyes. What? They have? - Yes. Samrat, let's leave this haunted house right now. Please. Let's go. And listen, I'll really give you the number.. ..of a witch-doctor. He's a big tantric. Call him. One is coming. He's returning tomorrow.. ..from his hermitage in Belgium. Satyadev Baba. He's not a tantric, but.. ..he's a powerful spiritual personality. Sir, the one sitting close to the Baba.. Your boss Mahendra Pratap Singh. On the left are Vijay and his wife Revati. On the right are Sanjay Singh and his wife Sunita. In the middle, their sister Divya. The one at the back is Puran kaka. That's Shanti, Puran kaka's daughter. And Rani, her assistant. Sir, Dimpy ma'am told me to tell you about everyone. But already you know everything. Your Dimpy ma'am told me. But...she didn't tell me about him. Who is he? - Sir, he's Deepak. He's a manager in the boss' company. And...these two? Sir, that's Mrs. Narayani and Mr. Kishore. The neighbors. They shifted here two months back. Sir, Mr. Kishore loves antiques like our boss. That's why they got along really well. Who told you that's the reason for their friendship? Sir... Relax. That IS the reason. I've liberated this place from the evil spirit. Now it will never trouble anyone. Just remember one thing. Don't let anyone untie this knot. Tomorrow at dawn, if any bud blossoms here.. ..then you can consider that the curse has been lifted. Hail God! Bless you! There's smoke but no fire. There's a shadow but no ray of light. There're words but nothing to say. Sometimes one needs to be puzzled to unravel mysteries.. ..and I am totally ready for it. Whether you get it or not, from Mumbai to Bareilly.. ..all want Shanti. By the way, I self Shanti. How do you? What would you take? Tea or coffee? Or you see.. - Black..coffee. Coffee. - Yes. Black. By the way, your incoming here is useless. Because your job is to catch the living beings.. ..not the dead. Buttermilk without curd. Tou see all home burden on my small head...hnn... You felt like kin so I opened up my heart. Otherwise I talk very less. Work load, no time you see. Shall we? Hey, you my assistant. You order, I fire. If I not here, wonder what will happen to this house. Shanti. (Peace) Brrrr...It's a sin to wash your hands.. ..in this cold weather of Shimla. It's cold. It's very cold. Where's my watch? It was right here. Oh...her. And you let that thief take it. She isn't a thief. If she was, then she would've.. ..taken the 1000 rupee notes sticking out of your wallet. She's a kleptomaniac. - Oh. You mean she has a habit of stealing. - Yes... Some diseases are so strange. My grandma used to make bitter gourds in her sleep. What are you doing here? Uh... umm... Nothing.. Sir..... I was looking for you, sir. I was looking for you. I am a big fanof yours. I stayed up all night.. ..and increased the TRP of your program. Just like you get in the skin of your character.. ..similarly, there are many characters in me. Vijay. Vijay Dinanath Chauhan. Full name. Mother's name Saraswati Chauhan. Age, 36 years 9 months 8 days and.. ..this is the 16th hour. If you're pushing your car.. ..because you've a flat tire, then you're alive. After being caught for drinking and driving.. ..you don't get beaten up by the police, then you're alive. Whether the government runs or not.. ..if you're driving your car, then you're alive. I'm giving you the opportunity.. ..to be the Godfather of Bollywood's biggest superstar. Please don't miss it. Please. Sir, just like a big superstar.. ..I want a car, bungalow, fame and fortune. Everything. But I am in a hurry, sir. You do have talent. Call me if you ever come to Mumbai. Keep in touch. Sir, thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. - It's okay. Was he a fool or trying to make us one? A man isn't what he shows. He's what he hides. Hey super express! Can't you see where you're going? You fool, a bud has blossomed in the garden. Bad spirit gone out. Great! Ghost is gone, flower in garden. Ghost is gone, flower in garden. Thank God! Isn't that wonderful news? There are more things in Heaven and Earth.. ..than your knowledge. STD, Believe it or not, there was a ghost in this house. And see...as soon as the ghost fled.. ..the garden has started to blossom again. The smallest case in STD's life. The End right after the opening titles. I am so happy, Samrat. I came here to say thanks. But I didn't do anything. Sometimes someone's presence.. ..makes a lot of difference. - Thanks. But do you think this flower.. ..is a reasonable reason to smile? No matter what the reason is.. ..but happiness has finally returned. And on this particular day. Tomorrow is papa's birthday. And there is small get-together this evening. Please do come - Sure. Every man has the same nature. It's only their habits that make them different. Keep your eyes and ears open. There are too many questions.. ..and just one night to find the answers... ...That's tonight. You mean...ghost.. The ghost hasn't fled?! The ghost that scared everyone.. ..gets scared by a red cloth?! Flowers blooming due to the grace of Belgium Baba!? Mahendra Pratap Singh still is sad.. ..even after the ghost fled... Hari hiding behind the door... Vijay detesting our presence... All these events point towards something untoward. That's the point. Why can't I think of all this? Anyway, nights are the mother of all mysteries. Vijay. Come, I'll introduce you to a special guest. Come. Let me introduce you. This is our lawyer Dinesh Das. You can also call him DD. I am used to CD. I'll get used to DD as well. Famous detective... Mr. Samrat Tilakdhari. DD sir, being famous is a.. ..disgusting by product of my job. Sanjay. Sorry, excuse me. Sanjay, come with me. Divya's unwell again. I'll just be back. - Excuse me. Please carry on. Poor Sanjay. I guess Divya's getting the fits again. So... Mahendra Pratap has changed his will. Yes, he did in a big haste. He got all the papers ready within 2 days. And signed it too. It seemed like he was going to forsake everything.. ..and retire to the Himalayas. But how did you know? My job is to arrive at conclusions.. ..from observations, DD sir. The blue ink on your thumb is still wet. And the thumb print is required.. ..when you need to get some.. ..important documents signed. Like invaluable property papers or...will. I think papa must be ready. I should go fetch him. I'll go get him. She dances really well. - Oh yes. Vijay sir has killed his father!! Papa! Send the body for post mortem after taking photos. Yes, sir. Don't miss any evidence. - Yes, sir. And no one enters this area.. ..until the investigation is over. I said no one enters this area. Cooperate with us, please. And everyone go wait in the hall. We'll call you one by one. You come with us. Come on. I never imagined that.. ..their frequent quarrels would lead to this. The reason for these quarrels, Puran kaka? Vijay's behavior. Vijay had no interest in business. He would squander money on bad habits. In a fit of rage the master.. ..put a stop to his squandering.. ..and the quarrels started since then. Relax. Now tell me everything that happened tonight in detail. I was in the kitchen. Just then...I received a call from the master. Hello. - Bring a jug of water to my room, Puran. Yes, sir. Vijay, my money isn't for you to squander. I won't give you a penny. I will take it, papa.. ..even if I have to do anything for it. Master would often forget.. ..to switch off the cordless phone. But Vijay's quarrels with the master.. ..had become a common thing. So I hung up the phone.. ..and went into master's room with the water. Master!!! Vijay sir has killed his father!! Did you see Vijay.. ..pressing on or taking off the pillow? Taking it off. But what does it all mean? I don't deduce conclusions so soon, Puran kaka. All I know is that one should believe.. ..someone who's doubted the most. He would often be brash with papa.. ..but that doesn't mean that Vijay.. No. No way. Brother couldn't have killed papa. Find the real killer at any cost. Sir. - Sit. Where are the CCTV cameras installed in the house? Ground floor, first floor.. ..and everywhere outside. And second floor? Everyone's bedrooms are on the second floor, so.. Oh, I see. Sir, this is the party's footage. Who is he? The one who's secretly getting into the party? That's Anuj. Dimpy's...friend. In fact papa and everyone else.. ..were strictly against Dimpy's choice. Because he's such a loser. In fact, two days ago papa warned him.. ..not to come anywhere close to Dimpy. But he was here. I didn't know it. Love no doubt gives you courage. Do you suspect anyone? - No. I cannot doubt anyone. Interesting...kids. Do you come here every day? - Yes, Samrat. Since childhood, I've been a believer.. ..in Vivekanand's saying "A healthy mind lives in a healthy body". And I teach them martial arts to keep them healthy. So that they don't lose hope in life without fighting. Good. You live up to your name: Deepak (lamp). A lamp burns to enlighten others. By the way, what's your view about Vijay? I've no position to have a view about my masters. By the way, think about it yourself.. ..if Sanjay sir doubted his brother.. ..would he spend all night arranging for Vijay's bail? Sir, we'll know the real matter.. ..only after the reports come in. This is a high-profile and sensitive case. Do it under the wrap. - Yes, sir. Sir, we arrested Vijay yesterday. The evidence.. - Good morning, sir. Samrat! How are you doing? Very fine Sir. Khalid. - Yes, sir. This is Samrat. My best student. Batch...2008, right? - Bang on, sir. He had to leave IPS because of weak eyesight. But he has a strong vision. That's why he's still doing the same job. The search of truth. Right? - Right, sir. What brings you here? The Mahendra Pratap Singh murder case, sir. Khalid was telling me about the same case. Oh really? Khalid, do help Samrat. And if required, take his help as well. All the best. Nice seeing you, sir. Insp. Khalid, with your permission.. ..can I see Vijay? You do have Sir's permission. And let me know if you find out anything else. Because now I have to help you.. ..and take your help too. If you want my help then tell me the truth. I was in the party when papa called me. Yes, papa. - Come to my room right now. No, I can't come now. - How dare you say no to me? Come now or you won't get a penny. Yes, papa, why did you call me? Papa! Master!! Vijay sir has killed his father!! Mr. Vijay, truth isn't a coin that has two sides. Either you're lying or Puran Kaka is. Sir. - Come, Samrat. I've something to show you. There are strange mails.. ..in Mahendra Pratap's email account. The first mail came one month ago. And then similar mails came every 4-5 days. The IP address for each mail is different.. ..so it's difficult to trace the sender. And even the code language.. ..can't be decoded. Sir, I had a word with the language expert. He thinks this is some old African language. He's trying. We'll soon reach a conclusion. Sir, can these emails be forwarded to me? Of course. Khalid. - Sir. CC to me. On the night of the murder.. ..Mahendra Pratap was sitting on this chair.. ..and talking to Puran kaka. Standing in front was a furious Vijay. Vijay lost his cool...and he started.. ..strangling Mahendra Pratap Singh. Mahendra Pratap struggled.. ..and in this battle between life and death.. ..death won. When he died...the phone must have slipped from his hand. My memory can't deceive me. The phone wasn't here that night. It wasn't anywhere. So where was the phone that night? You can't bind time.. ..at least wear your watch. Puran kaka returned it. It's right there. Oh, that's the point. Thank God you told me. Otherwise I would've thought.. ..this is the ghost's doing. CD, I went out to look for the ghost.. ..but I returned with evidence instead. Last night, I saw Enid Blyton and.. ..Hardy Boy's books on Mahendra Pratap's book shelf. So? How's it connected with this jumbled up ABCD of some kid? That's the point. Life is an unsolved puzzle, and I love it. HSR SHLD SNOZX ENQ XNTQ NKC RHM.. ..I know what it means. Guess. I am CD not STD. - It's simple CD. Replace every letter with its latter.. ..in the same setup and the message is clear. Like... Replace H with I. S with T. And R with S. That's ITS. And likewise. And the message is... 'It's Time To Pay For Your Old Sin'. Oh! That means an old secret is out. I'll try the second one. Death...Is...The... Rice. Not Rice, CD, Price. Oh yes, Price. Death...Is...The...Price. Yes. And this...mail just one day before the party. Life's ultimate goal is death. Happy Birthday. Get it? It wasn't the gardener's spirit.. ..it was these dreadful mails.. ..that were scaring Late Mahendra Pratap Singh. Thank you Samrat, for sharing this information. You really are smart. Arjun sir was right. I misjudged you. It's absolutely fine. Khalid. What does the post-mortem report say? Nothing unusual. As expected. The reason of death is asphyxiation. Vijay Singh has been granted bail. He's got bail, let's see what he gets in the will. According to Late Mahendra Pratap Singh's will.. ..50% share of his property.. ..will go to a charitable organization.. ..which runs an orphanage. And the remaining 50% will be equally divided.. ..between his children : Sanjay, Vijay, Divya and Dimpy. I don't accept this will. Since when did he start doing charity? He never gave a penny to a beggar. Control yourself, Vijay. The law will accept this will only. By the way, when did papa sign this will? On the 11th of this month at 11:15 pm. But why did he change the will? What was the reason? Will anyone tell me? The reason behind the will and kill is the same. This case is taking a new turn each day, CD. Some NGO benefitted from the will. But no connection. Or maybe indirect. The person sending the threat mails.. ..is an old friend or foe. But why would he leave behind evidence? The garden was withering.. ..but it turned lush green again when Belgium Baba arrived. The gardener's ghost mystery... Everything's clear but everything's fake. There are many paths in this maze.. ..but only one heads towards the destination. That's the point. But aren't all these evidences pointing towards something? CD a smart criminal isn't someone who doesn't leave behind evidence. It's someone who does leave behind an evidence.. ..but only to mislead us. Papa was getting threat mails? I don't know anything about it. Who? Who was sending papa these threat mails? We're still mum on whom. Did your papa have any enemies? There's no dearth of people.. ..who are jealous of someone's success. But...someone who would take his life? I don't think so. Mahendra Pratap was a very nice man. He reminded me of my father. He would share many things with me.. ..other than business. - Really? Did he ever mention the threats mails? And...I can never imagine.. ..that someone can threaten him. But he did received threats. Truth is like a ray of light. It won't go away if you close your eyes. According to you, who was his most trusted soldier.. ..who's known him for years. This happened 26 years ago. It was our first madam's 2nd death anniversary. First madam? Yes, my step mother... Papa's first wife. Brother Sanjay and sister Divya are her children. Oh, I see. I am listening, Puran kaka. There was a man called Nagendra. He would often get in master's ways. His car was rammed by a truck. The entire family died instantly. There was one body missing. Nagender's 7 year old son. People say he's still alive. But his whereabouts is a big mystery. There are whispers that.. ..our master had orchestrated that accident. Oh... Maybe it's a story of sweet strange revenge. I can see the sky. It was late Mahendra Pratap Singh's guilt.. ..not his fear that made him change his will... ...and donate 50% to the orphanage. What's the point of all this now? The master's already dead. Yes, Khalid. We're unable to trace Anuj. He's missing. I'll find him. Just text me his address. First this cat keeps crying all night.. ..and doesn't let me sleep, and now.. Hello. Sir, I am Samrat. I am investigating Mahendra Pratap's murder. Where's your tenant Anuj? Sir, he lives up here. But I've no clue where he has been since few days. What do I say? Anuj has no relatives or kin. He was raised in an orphanage. What to do? I've to check Anuj's room. I can't give you his room keys.. ..without his permission. That's fine. - Goodbye. What you were saying...the cat cries a lot at night? Cat? Don't ask, sir, sometimes she cries a lot. But...why, sir? That's the point, STD. Now I get everything. Anuj is the kid that survived in the accident. And he avenged his family's death. Simple. Possible. CD, go home. I just remembered something I've to do. What are you going to do without me? It's a small, simple task. Not of your caliber. Then it's okay. Anuj's phone is unreachable. His phone's switched off since the night of the murder. I can't ask you that how did you know. But I would like to tell you that.. ..there was nothing left between us. But I am a bit concerned about him. I wish even he was. But where did you find all this? Heart is fragile, handle it with care. Anuj's missing. I got my hands on these pictures. I deleted the files from his computer. You can burn these. Parents often sound wrong.. ..but mostly they are right. What did Anuj say to you in the party? Party? Anuj didn't meet me that night. But yes, he called me and said.. 'Dimpy, I want to tell you a secret about your family.' Any guesses what he wanted to say. - No. Did you ever try to find out the past.. ..of the person you were planning your future with? The heart doesn't ask questions, Samrat. It just trusts. He was raised in Little Dreams Orphanage. His character...is untainted. Was. That's the point, STD. Excuse me. STD, like I said this just like a Bollywood revenge drama. A boy returns to avenge his parents' death.. ..who died in an accident. Then he convinces a girl from the same family of his love.. ..and gains entrance into the house. Sends threat mails. Gets the will transferred in the name of the orphanage. And just like the threat mails.. ..he turns Happy Birth Day.. ..into a Saddy Death Day. No film can ever equal the twists of life, CD. Even if I agree to what you say.. Why did Anuj need to send threat mails.. ..and make the garden wither pretending to be the gardener's ghost. One more thing. If Anuj had left the city, then.. ..he wouldn't have left his personal belongings in his room. That means your small job.. ..was to convince Maganlal and get the key to Anuj's room. Right? I don't need a key to open locks, CD. You know that. I saw the entire CCTV footage of the party. We can see Anuj secretly entering the party. But not leaving. Where could he be? We saw him sneaking into the house but not leaving. Where is he then? Come on Samrat. Anuj didn't leave, means he was here only. So you mean to say.. Information is not knowledge, CD. We often find the first thing.. ..but we need to earn the second. Why didn't Anuj come out of the house? At 11:30 he was seen in this camera. At 11:40 he called Dimpy. But if he had entered the house.. ..he would've been seen in this camera. But he wasn't. If he went out of the house.. ..he would've gone in this direction. And he would be seen in this camera. But he wasn't seen here either. If he had gone in this direction.. ..then this camera would've captured him. 100%...he master's killer catching. What a pair. Like James Bonding. He wasn't in this camera, or this camera or this one. So where did Anuj.. Anuj! Samrat! Samrat! Tell me what's up! Samrat! Samrat! CD! Looking at the condition of the body.. ..I guess he died 3-4 days back. That's the point, STD. There's a dead body here and you're smiling. CD, do you know the address to success? Tell me quickly. On the path of difficulty, through the lane of questions.. ..in the alley of challenges. Come and get ready for the interesting mystery-ride! 'Revati's is in a hurry to go somewhere.' 'Oh, from a memorial service to a party.' 'That's called insentience.' 'No feelings or emotions.' 'Absolutely detached.' 'Two phones, two messages, two expressions.' 'One from a girlfriend, and the other for betting.' 'Somewhere he's losing his heart.' 'And somewhere his mind's losing.' 'Narayani couldn't keep a watch on her watch.' 'She wore it upside down.' 'So shocked over a neighbor's death!' 'Either she has a deep relationship or story.' Our calculations are all messed up. The one we suspected is dead. Who is doing all this? We'll know soon. My dear my friends, I know this isn't the right time. But I have good news for you, that.. ..I am just one step away from the murderer. Anuj knew the murderer, that's why he was killed. The person who has donned the mask of decency.. ..will be unmasked soon. You're no longer what you used to be, STD. You didn't tell me. I would, if I knew. Arrow in darkness, CD. I played a blind. We'll share the loot if we hit jackpot. Oh, I see. So there's no bride and you've announced marriage! How will you find the truth so soon? The truth will come to us, CD. How will it come to us? You and your Samrat-ism. My prayers work like a charm, sir. Please spare me some change. May God bless you. The beggars here are really generous. He gave us something in return. S...S...Samrat... It's a bomb! Throw it..! This is not meant to kill. It's carrying a message. Next time the bomb will be real. If you value your life then head back home. The watch is from a pen-stand from an office table. That means the one who sent the bomb.. ..isn't a professional bomb-maker. The tightness of this tape on the pens.. ..suggest that the person is strong. And the writing suggests.. ..that his Hindi isn't as good as yours, CD. We've hit jackpot, CD. Get ready to share the loot. What? Are you talking about sharing the real bomb? If you had shot this arrow in the Olympics.. ..you would've definitely won the Gold. Thanks, Khalid. Keep the cheese and the mouse trap ready. He's close. - Close? Then take this threat more seriously, STD. Don't worry, CD. This threat is going to lead us.. ..to the other end of the thread. Khalid, any help from Anuj's post-mortem report? There's been a shocking revelation. Mahendra Pratap and Anuj's.. ..time of death is almost same. Oh...maybe the gardener's ghost killed them both. But I feel Anuj killed Mahendra Pratap first.. ..and then someone killed Anuj. And it's also possible that.. ..someone killed Mahendra Pratap upstairs.. ..and somebody else killed Anuj. We missed one point. Maybe that person who was sending the threats killed both. Not possible. Why? Two different places at the same time.. ..two different victims, two killers. Two necks, two attacks. Different methods. Anuj's killer is heartless. Mahendra Pratap Singh's killer isn't that brutal. The person sending the threats.. ..wasn't spreading rumors about the ghost.. ..because he knew that Mahendra Pratap Singh.. ..will be scared of threats, not ghosts. One goal many strikers. More than one person are working on different things.. ..for different motives. And someone's taking advantage of it. Now we will have to find out.. ..who is doing exactly what. Hi. Hi. - I am sorry, Dimpy. First your papa, then Anuj. I can understand what you're going through. But I am a little short of sentiments. I just do not know how to express. It's okay, Samrat. Thanks for your concern. But honestly, I don't know why am I not sad about Anuj.. ..like I should be.. But yes, I miss papa. Your papa must have been proud.. ..to have a daughter like you. I am sorry for changing the subject matter. But I don't see the driver Hari around these days. Earlier he would always keep giving.. ..live performances of his mimicry. - Yes. I noted that too. He's been upset since papa passed away. And he was saying that.. ..he'll leave his job as soon as the police investigation is over. What? - Yes. I want to meet him now. Right now. I'll call him. Hello. - Hari, where are you? Sorry, madam. Since I had no work, I came to see a friend. I'll be back in an hour or two. Okay. Come back soon. - Okay, madam. Tail means the person sending the threats will attack again. Heads means the threats are a fake. That's the point. I wish I had the same coin Jai had in 'Sholay'. Anyways, God bless me. Stop. Stop. Tail. That means attack. Everything looks blurred. There are clouds all around. That means I am dead! That means I am dead! You're alive, CD. Get up. I am so sorry, Mr. Chakradhar. I apologize on behalf of Divya. You see...as a child, Divya saw her mother commit suicide. Since then she's a bit mentally disturbed. She gets violent whenever she gets the fits. Otherwise...she's quite calm. Chakradhar ji is absolutely fine. Please take care of Divya. If you need anything, please don't hesitate to ask. I am sure...that mental Divya killed Mahendra Pratap and Anuj. I swear on my show. I can never forget those blood filled eyes. CD, nightmares are meant to be forgotten. Get some rest. I'll be right back. From where? I want to see Hari's mimicry before he flees. His desire of becoming rich in a short time.. ..has got me thinking. Hari isn't planning to stay here too long. The empty hangers suggest.. ..that he's packed his bags to leave soon. Here's his train ticket for tomorrow. Hari's leaving for Mumbai tomorrow. But why did he suddenly plan on leaving? Tension, CD. Tension. Dust on the remote. That means film buff Hari.. ..didn't touch the remote after Mahendra Pratap's death. But Hari did come to his room. Because there's no dust on the light board switch. Mr. Chakradhar Pandey, would you like some cold water.. ..from an earthen pot in this cold weather of Shimla. No. I am not crazy. - Hari isn't too. So much money? Where did Hari get it from? Don't kill me. - CD! I am from Mumbai. CD! - Please don't kill me. CD! - I am dead. I am dead! You have 2 minutes. Not to make instant noodles, but to come with me. Get up. - Where? To see Hari. Case of hit and run. The accident took place yesterday.. ..and the villagers noticed the body today. Death is a beautiful conclusion of life.. ..but my conclusion is that, this isn't an accident. This is a murder. - What? Are you sure? I love to be sure. It's natural that last evening.. ..Hari didn't come to this secluded spot for an evening walk. Someone must have called him here for some work. And yesterday evening at around 7 pm.. ..Hari was standing under this bus stop.. ..waiting for that person. When he saw that person's car approaching.. ..Hari came on the road and waved at the car to stop. But when the car didn't stop Hari ran. We're dealing with a very cunning criminal, CD. Damn it. He's always one step ahead of me. Samrat... Samrat! Hi, good morning. Where are you coming from, this early in the morning? Hari's been murdered. - What? Who...who killed him? - You.. You started jogging recently? I have been jogiing for years. But who do you think committed the murder? The same person who killed Mahendra Pratap Singh. But you said you're going to expose the murderer soon. That's why he killed Hari. Lucknow City College. Which batch, Mrs. Narayani? Actually...I can't remember. I think it was the early 70's. Why? Mahendra Pratap was in the same college during the same period. Were you two batch mates? - No, no. Actually...I can't remember. Honestly, I really can't remember. Oh, I am sorry. I completely forgot. You told me that you two met just recently. What were you trying to find out, STD? CD, give me your mobile phone. - Here. Why? Does your mobile have network problem? CD, you're forgetting the rules of Samratism. Before finding someone.. ..you need to hide yourself. - Yes. Wait and watch. When the time comes... we'll reap the rewards.. ..and then I will answer the stupidest of your questions. Let me know when you get a reply. Someone came into this room precisely 2 minutes ago. And searched this place foolishly. Here? Who could it be? We'll find that out. But right now I am thinking about the one we just met. Mrs. Narayani. - Yes. Why did she lie? What is she hiding? An old friendship...or enmity. That means at this age Mr. Kishore.. ..will be single, ready to mingle. What do you mean? - That's the point. Every person you suspect, lands up dead. First Anuj, then Hari.. ..and now, poor Mrs. Narayani. This is the same kid's jumbled up ABCD. I sent a message in code. The game of hide and seek is over. When and where do we meet? And this is the reply. Tomorrow morning at 6, Jogger's park, last bench. And he's the one.. ..who used to send threats to Mahendra Pratap? And you sent him my number? - Yes. Are you my friend or foe? As soon as I return to Mumbai, I'll change this number. CD...if you change nothing, nothing will change. And anyway...he won't call you from Tihar Jail. For now let's call Khalid and call him also tomorrow morning.. ..completely prepared. Khalid, hope you have a good aim...? If I shoot someone's eye, his ear will not come to know. Okay, then it's fine. What do you know? You're good at jogging, but you can't run very far. You? - Yes, me. Who is it? I hope he doesn't attack STD. Take a seat. World's most lovable crime. Steal someone's peace and slumber. First threats, then rumors about ghosts. With a hope that the man dies of a cardiac arrest. But when that didn't happen.. ..you personally transported Mr. Mahendra Pratap.. ..to the Eden Gardens. - What? I recognised you in Mr. Mahendra Pratap's.. ..college group photo. And then your lie solidified my suspicion. Why did you kill him? I didn't kill him. Honestly.. - Whether the truth is beautiful or not.. ..i's consequences are. I never imagined that the return gift.. ..of a prank played years ago would be so dreadful. Thanks, mama. But there's still two minutes to 12. Hello. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! That was Mahendra's idea. But I broke my leg. Mahendra apologized to me many times for that prank. I wanted to scare Mahendra.. ..just like he scared me. After college...we met just two months ago. Luckily, I recognized him.. ..but he didn't recognize me. And taking advantage of this.. ..I started sending him those emails. Mahendra used code letters in college. I thought he'll understand. But that didn't happen. Then those ghostly events started. And I was enjoying the fear on his face. My small revenge was about to get completed.. ..on his 60th birthday. When I was going to gift him.. ..that college group photo and tell him the truth. But...before that... You know what...happened then... The next night I did go to his room.. ..to delete those mails. But my bad luck, the police had already taken his laptop into custody. Samrat, I haven't shared all this with anyone.. ..except for you. Not even with my husband. If you believe me, then please don't tell anyone. Please let it all be a secret. My job is to unravel secrets. But in your case, until and unless.. ..there's a really big reason, I will keep it under wraps. By the way who came to see you? You can say that he has no connection with this case. CD there was a point in your point. The jumbled ABCD was actually the prank of a kid. That's the point. If you had recognized my talent earlier.. ..you wouldn't have wasted 4 days. I am sorry, CD. I made a mistake. But now rack your brains.. ..and find out who's behind the three bigger pranks. Let's catch and send him to hell. - Okay. But, brother.. - This time I'll get you a big story. I've to go. I don't have time. No, no, telecast this episode with an old story. And listen...clear everyone's cheque. Mistress in distress. Any problem? Actually, I've to attend an important art exhibition. And there's not a single car at home. So...I am stuck. So take my car. - Oh, no, no, no. I've called up brother and asked him to send a car. Formalities are good between strangers. But we know each other a bit now. "This is a game of ABC..." "Don't take your foot off A.." "..and don't touch B and C." "If the arrow reduces to 50, you'll be responsible for a 'boom' .." A puzzle? What does it mean? What does it mean? What's he trying to say? What does A B C mean? Don't take your foot off A? What we do with the foot? Don't touch B and C. B and C means? Come on, Samrat. What does it mean? Come on, Samrat. Focus. A B C Come on, Samrat. Driving. First lesson of driving. ABC means Accelerator, Brake and Clutch. Don't take your foot off the accelerator. Don't touch the brake and clutch. Arrow points to the speedometer. If the speed reduces to 50...boom! The bomb will explode. Catch it. Hello. Dimpy, Samrat. Where are you? I am about to reach Mall Road. Okay. Hold your nerves and listen to me carefully. Don't reduce the car speed to 50 or less. But why? There's a bomb in the car. - What? Dimpy, don't worry. Do you trust me? - Yes, but.. Dimpy, do as I say. Just don't reduce the speed. Okay. Come on, Samrat focus. Dimpy's car will cross Mall Road.. ..and head towards Sanjoli Cross road. If the car's travelling at 60.. ..then it will take 3 minutes to get there. If I take the Civil Court road.. ..then it will take me the same time. But if I take the Old Market route.. ..then I might get there sooner.. Mister, what are you doing? Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Hey.. Mister.. Who's that? Stop. Samrat. Samrat. Thank you so much. I am really obliged. Are you okay? Look, Mr. Sanjay.. - Doctor. Nothing to worry about. She was unconscious due to the shock. There are few minor injuries. I've given her first aid. Thank you, doctor. When can we take Dimpy home? You can take her home now. STD... STD... How did this happen? Are you okay? He's more restless than us, CD. Yes, Khalid, I am fine. I've texted you a number. Just find out whom does it belong to. Fine, you'll have all the details by tomorrow morning. We just need to wait for tomorrow morning. Tomorrow's dawn will.. .. clear out all the darkness off this case. What a story! Murderer plants bomb in the car. Beautiful girl in the car. Samrat risks his life to save.. Coming. There's no one. Look down. B...B...Bomb.. Chakradharji... Don't touch it. Don't go so close. B...B...Bomb.. No...don't open it. Look, I am elder to you. Listen to me. Stop, Samrat. What you during, sir? Yoga. Bomb-phat asan. But I was only saving my life. Actually, the bomb was in my car.. ..so I was the target. You were going to unintentionally die my death. I would've done it intentionally as well. What? - Forget it. Another strange thing. The phone's registered in the name of the dead gardener.. ..who was fired from the job for stealing. The phone's switched off. But it was switched on a while ago in Mahendra Mansion. That means someone has untied the knot Belgium Baba tied. The gardener's ghost is back. Another shocking news. From the phone's call history we've learnt that.. ..that it's been frequently calling Satyadev Baba. That means the ghost has made.. ..an arrangement with the Baba. Baba has just returned from Belgium. He has a small hermitage close-by. He's an adopted child? Sure? Glory to thee! Glory to thee! Baba's waiting for you. Baba! Satyadev Baba. Oh, God! Baba's closed for business. It's the same dead gardener's number. CD, talk to him in Baba's voice. Talk to a ghost!? Say Glory to thee... talk to him. Okay. Glory to thee... Glory to thee... Failure to thee. Failure to thee. Greetings, Baba. I am really sad to know that you're dead. CD, give the phone to Samrat. Samrat. I am coming. Who was it? - What was he saying? Where are you going? - Listen. Samrat. Questions! Questions! More questions! Wait. - Don't go alone. Where are you going? We're coming along. Samrat. Samrat. Stop. Where are you going without me? Please listen to me. Samrat. Samrat. Samrat. Where did he go? - Maybe to get beaten up. What? Deepak (Lamp) can clear the darkness.. ..or burn down the house. I tried to explain to you... to stay away from this fire. I've a different way to understand and explain. Why didn't you kill me before I got to the Baba? That would've ended the story, STD. The real fun is in agony. Won't you show me whether.. ..you're just as strong as you are intelligent. And if you're scared.. ..then that's the way out. Samrat knows his way. Not bad. But you will lose...this time. Winning is my nature, Deepak. My challenge at Mahendra Pratap's memorial scared you. And due to that fear you started losing. By planting a fake bomb in my car. What? - Yes. The watch on the bomb.. ..was from the pen stand in your office. I also saw the offer letter from Dhanraj Group of Companies. Refusing an offer from such a big company.. ..to continue working for Mahendra Pratap.. ..wasn't for loyalty, but for revenge. Friends and foe never leave you alone. And you're no friend. Today morning I also received news from Bengaluru. 'He's an adopted child.' And then it wasn't difficult to find.. ..that you're the kid whose family.. ..Mahendra Pratap Singh had killed years ago.. ..and you came here for revenge. 'There was one body missing.' 'His 7 year old son.' I would've come to you even if you hadn't called. I came here to kill Mahendra Pratap. Kill him by ruining him. I was looking for the right opportunity. And as soon as I learnt about the gardener.. ..I took advantage. Then I hired a horticulturist. Made him wither the garden. And manipulated the forensic analysis. And then tampered the CCTV footages.. ..and spread the rumor about a ghost. Then you introduced that fake baba to Mahendra Pratap. So that he pretends to drive away the ghost.. ..and Mahendra Pratap develops faith in him. So that you can ruin his business.. ..in the name of stars and constellations. Two days before the baba arrived.. ..I asked the horticulturist to stop putting the chemicals. So that the garden turns green again after the havan (chanting). But your garden and ghost idea flopped. Because Mahendra Pratap Singh was scared of something else. Mahendra had commited many sins in his life.. ..and his guilt was the reason of his fear. If that rascal Anuj hadn't interfered.. ..then my plan would've been successful. Baba, everything's going according to plan. And after you drove away the imaginary ghost.. ..Mahendra Pratap trusts you completely. Here...the reward for your efforts. Greetings, Baba. Greetings. I came to seek your blessings. Glory to thee. Glory to thee. Dimpy, I want to tell you a secret related to your family. No, no, not now. I'll tell you when we meet. Deepak, make me a shareholder in your company. How much do you want? - For now, 2.5 million will do. But keep your mouth shut! Sure. That loser. He was black mailing me! Me?! I thought I'll dump his body after the party. But Mahendra Pratap got murdered. What? Didn't you kill Mahendra Pratap? I'll regret this till I live. I didn't want to kill him so easily.. ..in fact, I wanted to ruin him and torture him to death. But that sinner washed his sins.. ..by changing the will. Good kick. Why did you have to kill your crime partner that fake Baba? He was on your side. I thought I'll do one good deed before I go. There will be one less burden off this planet. I see. So finally, tell me why did you kill Hari? I didn't kill him either. What would I gain.. .. by killing that stupid mimicry artist? I feel sad for him. And I feel sad for you. After Mahendra Pratap's death.. ..I've no motive to live. And you better than you would know how boring life is without a motive. See...I won. Those who live...win. Samrat. Samrat. Are you fine? - Are you okay. Oh, God. Everyone get down, quick. - Yes, sir. 'Mahendra Pratap got murdered.' 'What would I gain by killing that stupid mimicry artist?' 'Vijay Dinanath Chauhan.' 'If you're pushing your car, then you're alive.' 'I love you Anjali.' 'Car, bungalow, fame, fortune.' 'I want everything, sir. Everything.' 'But I am in a hurry, sir.' 'I'll be back in an hour or two.' 'Hari's leaving for Mumbai tomorrow.' 'Case of hit and run.' Samrat, you fool! Everything was right before your eyes.. ..and you couldn't understand anything. How could you miss Hari? You're such a big fool. - Who? Who's a big fool, Samrat? - Me, CD. I am a big fool! Puran kaka and Vijay, both were telling the truth. How can two opposite versions be true at the same time? When there's a third lie. Third lie? This story's going to end where it started, CD. Let's prove it. - How? Mahendra Pratap Singh will come himself.. ..to name his murderer. But he's.. Spirits come and go, CD. Come on. I am Vikramjeet. I am not some baba or tantric. I am an astrophysicist. I've done extensive research on planchette. Planchette is one of the oldest and scientific ways.. ..to call a spirit. To find the real killer.. ..we're going to call Mahendra Pratap's spirit. In planchette, we need a medium. And through that we talk to spirits. And today our medium will be Mr. Chakradhar. Now all of you close your eyes.. ..and think about Mahendra Pratap. Mr. Mahendra Pratap...are you amongst us? Yes. If this is what you call being present, then I am. A man can die but once. Did your younger son Vijay kill you? He's my blood... ..but someone else has my blood on his hands. Who? Who is it? Divya?! Even this world doesn't believe it. But yes... What nonsense is this? Divya didn't kill papa. And that wasn't papa. Come, sir. I guess there's some ritual going on here. Sorry, but we had to come. We have an arrest warrant for Divya. And we just found out.. ..that the pillow used to suffocate Mr. Mahendra.. ..had Divya's fingerprints. And we also have statements.. ..from few guests at that party.. ..who say that they saw Divya.. ..go into Mahedra Pratap's room.. ..right before the murder. Insp. Khalid, if it's about fingerprints on the pillow.. ..then it also has Vijay's fingerprints. But that doesn't mean he's the killer. Sorry, we have enough proofs. And as far as you're concerned. You can prove it in the court. You don't get it, Divya can never do such a thing. She has tried to do something similar before. She attacked CD. That was a coincidence. Coincidences don't occur every day, Mr. Sanjay. She has attacked the servants of this house too. Trust me, this is a lie. Then what's the truth? The doctors suggested to send her to a mental asylum.. ..but your love kept her here. This is a conspiracy. Divya can never do such a thing? - Why can't she? Divya's mental condition got worse.. ..after she saw her mother commit suicide. She started hating her father. On his 60th birthday, when she had the fits again.. ..she was out of control. She then went to his room.. ..and strangled him with a pillow. That's a lie. Divya didn't hate papa. And the fingerprints on the pillow aren't Divya's. They can't be Divya's fingerprints! Absolutely right, Mr. Sanjay. But how do you know.. ..those weren't Divya's fingerprints on the pillow?? I'll tell you... Because while killing Mahendra Pratap.. ..you were wearing gloves! You killed Mahendra Pratap! You're the killer, Mr. Sanjay..!! - Yes, yes!! I killed him! I hated him. Truth is that light.. ..which can be seen even before dawn. Thank you, Khalid, for helping me. - Pleasure. And bravo, sub-inspector Vikramjeet Singh.. ..for your outstanding performance. - Thank you. CD, you're brilliant. I had my doubts when I saw the phone in it's place. But my doubts were confirmed.. ..when I kept a sample of mud.. ..from Hari's murder spot. And I found the same mud on your car's tires. I was convinced, but confused too. But when Deepak said he has nothing to gain.. ..by killing a mimicry artist like Hari.. ..that's when I understood.. ..that you have everything to gain from it. I had no other way to prove.. ..that you are the murderer. That's why I had to pick this option. My mother committed suicide because of my father. He's responsible for my sister's condition. After coercing my mother to committing suicide.. ..papa got married again. I could never accept Vijay. And that's why.. ..you showered false love on your step-brother.. ..and spoiled him. So that he turned out good for nothing... And even lost respect in his dad's eyes. You could see the entire property in your name.. ..but you got a shock when.. ..in the first will, your dad divided the property equally. You were furious, but you lost control.. ..when you found out that.. ..your papa is going to change his will.. ..and donate half his property to charity, you decided that before he changes his will.. ..you will change his world. And put the blame on Vijay. Thus, complete control over the entire property. But so sad. You had no clue that.. ..Mahendra Pratap had already signed his new will. An important part of your plan was Hari, the mimicry artist. It was his voice that Puran Kaka.. ..and Vijay heard that night. Right? That night, after calming Divya.. ..I spoke to Hari. Hello. You always look for ways to make money the easy way. I will give you 1 million. And your first break too. You just need to show your talent. He agreed. My job became easier. Then I took papa's phone to Hari. Hello. - Bring a jug of water to my room, Puran. I want money, and that's it. Yes, papa. - Vijay, come to my room. And the next day I kept the phone back in papa's room. Hari was unaware that when he was doing all this.. .. he's going to be a part of a murder. But when he realized this, he was very scared. And was preparing to flee. Sanjay thought that I am after Hari. That's when he called Hari to a secluded spot.. ..on the pretext of paying the rest of the money. But he killed him instead. Come with us. You knew about your husband's intentions.. ..and his crime. You were scared that I might uncover him. So you often followed me. You even searched my room that day. 'Someone came into this room two minutes ago.' But...fear doesn't change or hide the truth. Shall we, CD. By the way, you're making more fans by the day. Count me in. Samrat. We couldn't find Deepak's body. Did you really expect...to find his body? Samrat. Thank you. I don't know whether I should be happy or sad. That's life. Yes, this is for you. Thank you. Money is the 8th sense.. ..that lets us enjoy the other senses. Samrat. Someone's sent this bouquet for you. But I can't figure out what's written on it. Some riddles are best left unsolved. Thanks. Samrat. If I ever need you again.. ..will I have to suffer the journey again... Or can I give you a call? What are you thinking? Answer that call and you'll find me on the other side. Save it. - Thank you. Do you have to go today? - Yes. But before I leave I want to say something.. ..which I have never said to anyone before. What? We'll meet again. I am fed up of this cold. I am going to enjoy the heat in Mumbai. No work for an entire month. Samrat. What? Fine, we'll be there. Guess what? That was Her Highness Priyanka Raghuvanshi of Dharamgatpur. The 200 year old gold statue.. ..of a King of Raghuvanshi dynasty, Sangramaditya Raghuvanshi.. .. is shedding tears of blood. We've to start working on the case from tomorrow. Tears from a golden statue? And that too of blood. We just got rid of one ghost, and now there's another! Why don't you take some normal case? CD, easy challenges are like broken pencils... There's no point!
