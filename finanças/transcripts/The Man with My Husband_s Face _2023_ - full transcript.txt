I always knew. I always knew my parents were keeping something from me. Bastards! I can tell this is very upsetting for you. That should have been my life. My house. My wife. This is something very big to learn about yourself. It's understandable that you would feel... I can see you're feeling very betrayed right now. You don't see a damned thing. Where are you going? I'm gonna get what should be mine. Kat. Is the coffee ready? Babe? Is the coffee ready? Huh? Coffee? Uh, sweetie, I don't drink coffee. I know. I asked you to put some on for me. When? Like twenty minutes ago. I called from downstairs... Can you at least look at me? I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. I'm trying to focus in just getting some writing done before work. Try to take another stab at this book. Right. Don't worry about it. I can get some on my way to work. Right. I really am sorry. It's fine. - Love you. - Yes. I thought you were a writer. Katrina? Sorry? I said, I thought you were working on a book. Yeah. Yeah, I am. It's, um... it's set in the early days of women's pro baseball. It's like if Virginia Woolf wrote A League of Their Own? But my day job is at Zoink. Like the video chat thing? Yes. Yeah. You know the Zoinkbot pops up with all those annoying tips when you first download the app? I write what the Zoinkbot says. - I see. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It was just supposed to be until I finished the book, but now it's been... uh... 11 years. That's why I have those stock options from the early start up days. Understood. Page five should cover those. Yeah. So... so we have to... revise anything? No. Are you sure? Having second thoughts? No. I just... I just wish there was something I could point to, you know, that was... big and clear and obviously broken. So it'd feel a little bit more... sure. Divorce is like jumping out of a plane. Yes or no. If you need to be sure, give things one last try. Give me a call when you're ready to jump. Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Ligotti. I'll walk you out. Hi. Yeah, I would like to make a reservation. Katrina. Tomorrow, for two. Great. Thank you so much. Nuh-huh-huh! Not another step. What? I have a surprise for you. - Seriously? - Seriously. Close your eyes. Don't peek! Come with me. - What are you doing? - Okay. Stop... Okay. Open! You have been working so much so hard recently, so I thought I'd make you your favorite: steak with mashed potatoes and salsa verde. - With no cilantro? - No! Of course not. I know you think it tastes like soap. Oh, my God! This is... Kat, thank you. You're welcome. You're welcome, baby. Okay. Let's eat before it gets cold. - Yeah. After you. - Thank you. Wow! It's amazing. Yeah, not so bad. Cheers. - Good surprise? - Yeah. A great surprise. Well, it's not over yet. - No? - Mm-hmm! Not by a long shot. I got us a reservation to go kayaking tomorrow morning, first thing. Tomorrow? Yeah, they had two spots open. I can't. I can't tomorrow. - What? - I've gotta work. It's Saturday. Yeah, no, I've got that call on that project with the Tillmans. You've been working every weekend for two months. You said you were finally gonna take one day off. Yeah, I just... I can't. I mean, we are so close to a deal and they're counting on me. Heath, please. Okay... I'll see what I can do. Thank you. Just listen! I thought it all through. Okay? I, I... Trust me. It's gonna work, alright? Look, all we're doing is changing the time. Okay, look. I can go tomorrow, and it'll all be fine. Trust me. Good. Okay. I'll see you then. So? - I got the meeting pushed back. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - So we're on for tomorrow? First thing, bright and early. Thank you so much! Let's go to bed. Grab your water bottle, Heath! Heath? Hon? Heath? Heath? Yeah? - You ready to go? - Uh... Yeah. Definitely. Just let me... - You good? - Yeah. Let's go. Okay, let's go. Geez. Heath? Heath! Yeah? Let's go! - What are you doing? - Come on. Heath, do you remember which size paddle I use? Why aren't you ready yet? I don't know if I did a two-twenty or a two-thirty. Does it really matter? - Maybe I should ask someone. - Just pick one. - What's gotten into you? - Nothing. We gotta go. Okay. I'm just gonna ask someone. It'll take me two seconds. What's going on? I have to be back by 2:30. For...? For the call with the Tillmans. I thought you pushed it. I did. To 2:30. Okay. So you lied to me. No, I told you that... Heath, I ask you to do one tiny thing so we can... Look, Katrina! We don't all get to sit home in our pajamas and write cute little tech tips all day. Some of us actually have to go to work. Some of us actually have to still make money. You know, because if we don't... What? If we don't, then what? I'll meet you on the dock. Heath... Excuse me? What's up? Did you see a guy come on in a red t-shirt and black glasses? Yeah, he came and grabbed a boat and took off. Dude seemed... motivated. Wow. Really? Yeah. Thanks. Help me get her in this red one. Heath! Heath! Oh! Sorry! Thank you. There you go. Thank you. Heath, it's me. Um... I'm really sorry I got mad. Okay? Please call me back. I'm getting worried. Yeah, got him. Heath Grierson, kayak 865. All of his gear's still out. what? Are you sure that no one saw him out on the water? I'm sure. Could I just take a kayak out and go look for him? I'm sorry. We're closing. Okay... what am I supposed to do? I mean, I'm always loath to involve the boys in blue but... Okay. Thank you. Hi, I need to report a missing person. So after you two argued, he left. He just went down to the boat launch. Did anyone see him launch? Uh, yeah. Over there. Z saw him. Okay. Well, is there anyone you haven't called? Could he be with his family? No. He's an only child. Adopted. And both his parents died a couple years ago. What about friends? I've called everyone. Any co-workers? Nope. Heath is self-employed. Uh, commercial real estate. Though he has been working with, um... some local contractor on a big project. Got a name for them? Uh... something Tillman? - Alright. - I could see if I have an email. This is Brand. Alright, I'll be right there. Looks like they've found something. You need to come with me. Okay. 865. It's his alright. - So where is he? - Let's check it out. I need you to call canine, get a perimetre set up out front. Ms. Grierson, I need you to stay outside with the officer. I'm gonna go inside and search the house. Why don't we all search? We'll find him faster. It's not safe. - He's my husband! - Look... You can either stay outside with the officer, or sit in the back of a squad car. Fine. Do you have any water? Wait here. Thank you. What the hell? Oh, my God. I know I told you to stay outside. - Well, I didn't agree to that, did I? - Come on, let's go! I just wanna help find him. Are you a trained scuba diver? Or a wilderness search and rescue officer? Well? No. Then you can't help! We've got a lot of woods and a lot of water to search out here, and the last thing I'm trying to add is another missing person to this mess. That was harsh. I apologize. I just wanna find my husband. I know. Me too. So, please, trust me when I say the best thing you can do is get some rest and keep your phone on. Okay. I'm gonna have an officer drive you back to your car. - Fine. - Come on. How can there be no sign of him? It's been five days! I know... I know that. Yeah, okay, I'll let you do your job. Do you know what kinda car it was? No. It was black. You said that. Did you get a plate number? It just happened so fast. How many hours of sleep are you running on? Please don't start with that. How many? Three. But I saw him. - I know you think you did. - No, I did. Okay. I'm gonna relay this to my guys but... But? I don't want you to get your hopes up. We have to be realistic here. The longer a search and rescue goes on, the more likely it is to turn into a body recovery. I saw him. Alive. As clear as I see you right now. Katrina, I don't mean to be blunt, but what's more likely? That Heath's been running around town for a week, and the only person who's seen him is his wife? Or that under a tremendous amount of stress, trauma, and sleep deprivation, you made a mistake? I know what I saw. Damn! Hello? It's Crampton Ligotti. Uh, yeah, hi. How are you holdin' up? Uh, hard to say. 'Course, no news, then? No. I'm sorry, Mr. Ligotti, but what is this about? I've realized that there's a loophole in your will, specifically in the case that you're incapacitated. I've drawn up an addendum that handles that. Are you free to come in later this morning to sign it? It can't wait? I'm afraid not. Yeah, okay. Heath? Heath! Heath! Heath? It's like he just vanished into thin air. And did anyone else see him? - I don't know. - Did you ask anyone? No, I just came straight here because you weren't answering your phone. Katrina... No, this is not a daydream, or stress, or whatever you're thinking. Okay. What alley was it? Uh, off Boll Street. Right by Solomon's. All right. Anything else? Why aren't you taking this seriously? This is a lead! A lead? This isn't a lead. Well, it's the best we've got! There is no we. There's just me trying to do my job and you getting in my way. It's been a long week. For us both. I'm sorry I didn't take you seriously. I'm gonna send some guys down to this alley but at this point... No, he is alive, okay? I know it! Brand. Are you sure? What is it? You were right. He's alive. Come on! I'll explain on the way. I spoke to the admitting nurse. Apparently, he just wandered into the ER. They said he didn't even know his name. Did the doc have anything else to say? Do you have anything to say? Katrina, it wasn't him. How could a delirious and severely dehydrated man, with no car or phone, travel this far, that quickly? I know what I saw. Fine. Let's just drop it. What did the doc say? The initial diagnosis is a temporary dissociative state. It's a mental break brought on by a combination of stress and repressed trauma. Yeah. You lose your memory and all sense of who you are. Sometimes you can just wander off. It could be permanent. But not always. And in this case? They're not sure yet. Hey, hey, sweetie. What's he doing? It's the needle. He has a phobia. - Katrina. - Hi. You're okay, just relax. Hmm. I'm right here, okay? I'm right here. - Hi. - Katrina. Hi. What? Am I, am I in a hospital? Yes. You're okay. You just got lost and disoriented, but you're okay. Hi. Just breathe. You're all right. At the kayak shop... what I said to you. I was wrong. It's okay. I'm sorry. Me too. Glad you're here. I'm so happy you're okay. - Ow. - Hey. - I know. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I have, I have a needle in my arm. Yeah. - Oh. - I know. - Oh boy. - It's okay. Okay, it's okay. Just-just remind me not to look down. Don't look down. Okay. Oh boy. I love you. I love you, too. Be careful. You're still recovering. I know. I'm okay. Do you want a hand? - Nope. - Okay. Actually, you know, I think I might need a hand. - Yeah? - Yeah. It's all right just... you'll feel completely normal, in no time. Oh, I'm sure with you helping me, I will. I will do what I can. You know, without you, the doc said I wouldn't have been back on my feet for another month. So, take the compliment. Fine. If you promise to take it easy today, for real. Deal. Deal. Here you are. - Hey. - I made you some coffee. - Oh, thank you. - Mm-hmm. What are you doin' out here? Sunbathing? No, I'm just um... just remembering things. Really? Well, no, not-not like that. I mean, I still don't remember seeing you downtown or anything. That whole... that whole time's just a blank. Hmm. So, what were you remembering? Just lots of things. Things about us. Like what? The early days. - Hmm. - When we first got married. Hmm. Those were good times. Yeah, they were. I'm also... been remembering you know, the bad times. Heath... Don't... let me just... let me finish. I know recently we've had a lot more bad times than we've had good times, right? Yeah. And a lot of that is because of me. No, it's not only you. No, but a lot of it is. I ruined our kayak trip. You were lost in the woods. I ruined it before I got lost in the woods. Yeah. I'm done acting like that. I'm gonna change and I'm gonna start by planning another trip, to make up for the one that I ruined. That sounds great. I promise I'm gonna try to be better. Thank you. I love you. I love you, too. Thank you for the coffee. You're welcome. Katrina, I'm sorry to bother you. I have left several messages. Oh, sorry. Uh, things have just been a little hectic. You thought anymore about the divorce? Katrina? Yeah, I think I wanna put a hold on that. Come by and close up the power of attorney loophole I mentioned. Yeah, I think we can wait on that, too. I really would not advise that. I'm really sorry, I gotta go. Is now not a good time? Uh, no, it's fine. It was just Wally from work. - Ah. - What's all this? Well, this is me thinking it was a good time for our surprise outing. Already? You just got home. I feel like, with you nursing me back to health, I can run a marathon. Okay, well then, let's go! Let me just get changed. Okay. Look at you! - After you. - Thank you. Hmm. - How beautiful is this? - Mm-hmm. I love it. Okay, we got the... What did you bring us for lunch? Um... I forgot. Think you're so funny! I am certain I am, actually. This woman is like, staring right at us. - Who? - Over... She's gone. Sorry. Come on. Let's go find a spot. Hey. Hmm? What's on your mind? Hmm... nothing. I'm just thoroughly enjoying myself. Well, good. We should do this more often. Like, picnic? No, just like, go on dates. That sounds good. Do you remember our first date? How can I forget? You were so beautiful. Beautiful? Yeah. - Well... - Okay. Heath, I had emergency dental surgery the day of our first date. I wouldn't say beautiful. I... I know, but you were beautiful to me. Okay, that's very sweet. - Well, I mean. - You tried. You were like, in a cute, sexy, chipmunk kinda way. Uh-huh. All right. That's enough, thank you. - Big old cheeks. - Okay, that's good. That was nice. Mm-hmm. - Where're you goin'? - Bathroom. Hey... I love you. I love you, too. You. Hey! Hey! What are you doing here? Katrina. To what do I owe the pleasure? I just needed to drop this off. For me? It's my way of saying thank you for all of your help and for putting up with all of my crazy. Ah. I was just doing my job. Even so, it's signed by Nomar Garciaparra. I wasn't sure if you were for Georgia or Georgia Tech but I guess I was hoping you were on the side of the Angels? What's the good word? To hell with Georgia! Ah! I love it. I'll put him on the shelf, right next to Coach Hall. Perfect. So, how are things? Ah, a little weird, I guess. You guess? I mean, so there was this woman outside of my house today staring at me, and I think I saw her at the park, too. Ah, it's probably just a neighbor who saw you on the news. Happens all the time. So, how's Heath? He's... good. Why the pause? I don't know. I... ever since he's been back, things have just been a little... um... A little... Weird. Off. I-I don't know. Hey, you both have been through a traumatic ordeal. I'd be surprised if things weren't a little weird. He hasn't hurt you, has he? Uh, no. No, nothing like that. He's just... he's just not quite himself. That's all. Trust me. Just give it some time. Things will be back to normal. Yeah. Hey, I really appreciate this. This is a great gift. I'm glad you like it. I'll let you get back to work. - All right. - Thanks. Damn it! Heath? Hey, hon. What's goin' on? What are you doin'? Oh, uh... sorry, I... I changed my password the day before we went kayaking and I just... I cannot remember it. So, I just, I got frustrated. Yeah, I mean, understandable. Sorry. Thanks. Any progress? Nope. You goin' somewhere? Yeah, Wally wants me to come to the office to go over the new Zoink bot dialogue in person. Good luck. Thank you. You too. Tell Willy I said hello. You mean, Wally? - Yeah, I... - I don't know. I just... this thing's just got me going crazy, um... Yeah. Okay. Babe... I love you. I love you, too. Katrina, I really need to speak to you. You-you're the one that's been following me. I'm not gonna hurt you. Your life is in danger. I really have to talk to you about Heath. - Who are you? - He's not the same, is he? He's different since he's been back? And maybe not in a way you can name but in a way you can feel. He forgets things, he gets things wrong, little things, but things he should know. And he's angrier, right? But-but most of all, it's a feeling, right? This feeling that beyond all rationale, your husband is now somehow a stranger? Does your husband have any tattoos? No, he-he hates needles. Then you need to check his ankle, his right ankle, and then call me. Why? Wh-what's on his ankle? Proof of what you already know. Just call me when you see it. Hey. - Hey. - How was Wally? Uh, fine. Good. Good. Look uh... about earlier, I wanted to apologize. I uh, I got frustrated. You know, since this whole dissociation thing I keep... just keep forgetting things. It's okay. It's not your fault. I know. I can't control it but I can control how I react to it. And that's what I wanted to apologize for. Okay. Well, apology accepted. To make it up to you, I made dinner. - Really? - Yeah. And the special on tonight's menu... grilled chicken with a marmalade glaze and a side of vegetables. Wow. My compliments to the chef. - I'll be sure to let him know. - Please do. Before we start, a toast. To us. 'Til death do us part. Mm-hmm, hear, hear. All right, let's dig in. Wow, this looks amazing. Hey. I'm gonna turn in. Okay. I'll just be a sec. I'm trying to figure out this 1-6, 1-5 double play. Okay. Well, good night and good luck. Thank you. Good night. Katrina? Hey, I'm just coming to bed. Go back to sleep. Good night. - You're up early. - Yeah. Couldn't go back to sleep so I thought I would make us a little breakfast. Southwestern omelet sound good? - That sounds perfect. - Good. Coffee? Thanks. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Hey. Here you go. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Wow, look at this. Yeah, I can cook. This is great. - Yeah? - Yeah! Not too much cilantro? It's perfect. Good. Mm. You've reached Detective Felix Brand. Leave a message. Hi, Brand, it's Katrina. I think... could you just call me back when you get this, please? Yes, I-I... Don't say anything more than you have to. Did you see the proof? Yeah. My address is 824 Hansmore Place. Come here, now. - Right now? - Yes. I'll be waiting. Okay. Who was that? What? On the phone. Uh, Wally, of course. He wants me to come back in for more Zoink bot talk. - Oh, what a freaking headache. - I know. You gotta go right now? Or do we got time to... Hey. Come on, we'll be quick. We'll be super quick. Wally can wait. I got my period this morning. That's why I couldn't sleep. I have really bad cramps. I gotcha. Sorry. It's all right, it's all right. Okay, well, have a good day at work. You too. His name is Jacob Vance. I've been his court-appointed psychiatrist for the last seven years. Until he vanished. Just before Heath disappeared. - I... - Let me finish. To do this job, you have to see the humanity struggling beneath a person's disorders. And despite seven years of trying, I never saw that in Vance. I've come to believe it's because there's nothing there. There's no disorder to diagnose and no humanity underneath. I'm breaching every ethical guideline of my profession by speaking to you but I can't let him do this to you. There's something I have to show you. I always knew. I always knew my parents were keeping something from me. Huh, bastards. I can tell this is very upsetting for you. That should've been my life. My house. My wife. This is something very big to learn about yourself. It's-it's understandable that you would feel... I can see you're feeling very betrayed right now. You don't see a damn thing. Where are you going? I'm going to get what should be mine. I'm sorry, but that is my hus... that-that's Heath. Check the last page in that file. It's an adoption record. Jacob and Heath were twins adopted to different families. Jacob learned the truth a few months ago and he was furious. Why? Jacob struggled throughout his entire life for... for reasons in and out of his control. But when he saw Heath's life, he was consumed with rage and envy. I tried my best, but what you saw, that was our last session. So, you're saying that... Jacob saw the life that he wanted and he took it. By replacing Heath. Thank God. I was worried you wouldn't believe me. I... didn't... at first, but now I've... Now you've accepted what you already know. Yeah. As much as I don't want to. We need to go to the police. We can't, not yet. - Why not? - Because we can't prove anything. What, we have the file and the tapes. But what does that prove? That-that Heath had a twin, that I treated him? Maybe. But it doesn't prove a thing about the man living in your house. - But it's the truth. - It is. You know it and I know it. But we can't prove it. We can't even prove a crime has taken place. Uh, Detective Brand will believe me. I-I've seen Jacob, and he knows. He might believe you but he can't charge him or put him behind bars, and the only thing that'll do is let Jacob know that we know. Okay. So, what do we do? There's only one thing we can do. We find Heath. He is the only thing that can help us prove what we know. Okay. So, we find Heath and we get that son of a bitch. Heath? I'm back here. - Going somewhere? - Yeah, duty calls. Travis has got the drywall up so I'm gonna go take a look. Ah. How was uh... how's Wally? Wa... , oh uh... good. Fine. He was good on the new copy. Glad to hear it. - Mm-hmm. - All right. See ya in a bit. - Bye. - See ya later. Prisca, he just left. Got it. Hey, where are you? He just went down an alley off Broom Street. You come around the far side, I'll watch from this end. Okay, be right there. Jacob! Do you really think... I mean what is... - Jacob, let go! - Get over here. Get over! Shut up! Don't touch me. Shut up. If I ever catch you... If I ever catch you... If I ever catch you following me again, I will gut you like a fish. Don't forget, I know where you live. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. - No, no, it's okay. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. - I didn't know what to do. We can't let him see you, okay? What are you thinking about? I was... thinking about divorce before he disappeared. I mean... I thought that I felt so alone for the past few years. But now I... now I know what alone really feels like. Hey... you are not alone. Thank you. Let me know if he goes out again. I'll be parked nearby. And make sure you have an excuse when you get home. Right. - Where have you been? - Oh, my God, you scared me. I'm sorry. I'm just wondering where you were. I was about to be worried. I was just out running some errands. I was thinking salmon for dinner. Sounds good. Oh, shoot, I left a uh, fizzy water out in the car. - You want me to get it? - No, it's fine. I'll be right back. You ready for bed? You go on ahead. I'm just trying to get a little work done. What are you workin' on? You know what? Nothing. You're right, let's go to bed. Thanks. You know I have trouble sleeping without you. I'll be right in. Help! - Hey, you okay? - Yeah. It's Wally. Hello? You okay? Yeah, I'm just going to bed. Okay, take it away. Uh... it can't wait? Yeah, okay. I'm on it. - Good luck. - What's going on? Apparently, one of the servers crashed and I have to redo everything I did today. Right now? Yeah. Don't wait up. I just spent the whole night clutching my blanket. Thank God you put that chair against the knob. Hold on, I think he's coming. Do... uh, stay on the line. Hey. Who're you talking to? Uh, no one. I was just trying to talk out a scene. Yeah. Big day? Yeah, actually. I'm heading to another work site that Tillman's got goin'. - Oh. - I might be late for dinner. Okay. You never came back to bed last night. No, I, uh, fell asleep halfway through the upload. Well, how'd you sleep? Uh, fine, considering. Yeah. I was out like a light until this morning. Well, I'm glad you were able to get some rest despite Wally's best efforts. Yeah. Okay. I should get going. - Have a good day. - You too. Prisca. I heard everything. Do you think he bought it? I don't know I... oh, he's coming out of the driveway now. Uh, should I help you tell him? No, uh, search the house. Katrina? Uh, I'm in here, hon. Hi, your contacts look great. What're you doin'? Uh, just cleaning up a little bit. How was uh... work? Long. Any uh, headway on the book? Uh, not really. Little bit. I'm just gonna take a quick shower. Okay, enjoy. I don't even know what I'm looking for. I'm just searching types of keys and hoping I get lucky. Is that like, a car key? No, it's smaller. And it's got numbers on it, 407. It's like a unit. I don't know, has he gone to like, a motel or an apartment? No. Wait, there is one place. - Hey. - Hey! Where are you going? Uh, batting cages. I just gotta clear my head a little bit. Oh, what about dinner? Oh, I'll be back before dinner. Definitely. Katrina. You forgot your purse. Oh, geez. Thank you. When I was tailing Heath, I lost him at a light. Maybe he went in here. Let's try that key. Hi. Hey. Here we go. Thanks. What the hell? Are you ready? Yeah. Oh, God! Heath! Oh, my God! He's dead. - You don't know that! - Yes, I do! - Let me... let me go! - He's dead and you know it. - This is a crime scene. - We need the police. Katrina, you did it. This is the proof. Come on. Come on. I'll go get the documents. The police will handle this. Katrina, what you're telling me sounds... - What? - Unlikely. Right, I know that. Okay, I barely believe it myself but Prisca can corroborate everything. No, no, no, no, no. He was just here! Brand, he was just here. I swear to you, he was just here. I saw him! - Katrina, come on. - Prisca will tell you. She was here. She saw it too! - Katrina, let's go. - He was just in here! - Let's go. - Jacob Vance did this! Jacob Vance did this. I don't know how, but he did it, I swear to you. She's not answering. - So, do you wanna... - Oh, my God. We have to go there. What? We-we have to go to her. Jacob could be there. He probably went to her house after he took the body. - Look, let's just... - Brand, Brand, please. Please. Okay, let's go. Stay right here. Let me do the talking. Jesus, do you know what time it is? Dr. Prisca Geddings? What? I'm Detective Felix Brand. I'm here because Katrina... Prisca, just tell him about the body. The what? Heath's body that we just found. Detective, I've never seen this woman before in my life. It's okay. What did she say? Well, for one, she says she's not Prisca. - What? - She says she's Ivy Kurzik, a massage therapist. And her ID checks out. She also says she doesn't know Prisca Geddings, Jacob Vance, or you. No, that's not true. She knows me. I've been in her house. I have her card with... with her address, and all of it. - Katrina. - Just give me two seconds. I know that I have it. She-she gave it to me. - Katrina. - Okay. Okay, just forget it. There-there is a file inside of her house with all of the evidence in it. If we just go... Look, let's just go back to the station, let's... we can talk there. - It... - Heath can meet us there. No, you-you can't call him. I already did. Are-are you not listening to me? - Heath can meet us there. - He's dangerous! And she's helping him and I can prove it! Katrina! It-it wasn't like this before, I swear. There's... it was her office. There's two chairs and... - Why don't we go back to the station? - I'm not lying. - Let's go back to the station. - You need to believe me. Let me just... Okay. It's okay. Okay. File in there with everything in it. I swear to God, you have to believe me. - Okay. Katrina, okay! - You have to believe me. - Come on, let's go back to the station. - She knows me. She's... no. - Okay. - She knows everything that's going on! - It's okay. - Please, Detective, I'm begging you. I am not lying. He was there. She knows me. Prisca! Prisca, tell him you know me! Let me see it. Let me see your ankle. Let me see the left. Satisfied? Yeah. Have a seat. I'll be back. - Did you see it? - There's nothing to see. Did you look, though? I just saw it. I check both ankles just like you said. Well, then, it has to be makeup or something. I don't know. Look, Katrina, you've spent hours telling me about missing bodies, and secret tattoos, and evil twins, but all I'm asking for is one thing you can actually prove! I can't prove it, okay? But that does not mean it isn't true. Okay. I'm gonna go talk to Heath. Again. Detective, please. You have to believe me. Have a seat and I'll be back. Just have a seat. Please. I'm afraid we're looking at temporary psychiatric hold. Is that really necessary? We're out of options. - Can I just talk to her? - No. She's... she's really scaring me. Okay. I'll do the psychiatric hold. But just temporarily. Of course. There's some paperwork you need to fill out. I'll get it. All right. Is Katrina taking any medications? Uh, yeah, she-she takes something for her stomach, I think. I'm gonna need you to run home and grab them. The docs will wanna review them before they start the treatment. All right. I'll stay here with her until you get back. Okay. Uh... All right, I'll-I'll go now. Okay. This is enough to get me started but I'm gonna need you to fill out these at some point. Okay, are these to establish the conservatorship? Conservatorship? That's a little premature. Well, I wasn't sure how it worked. I just... I guess I got ahead of myself. Yeah. Hopefully, we won't get to that point. Right. I mean, God forbid. Uh, I'll be right back with her meds. All right, I'll be right here. Let go of me! Let go of me! Get off of me! Get off me! Get off of me! Let me go! Somebody help me! No! Get off of me! No! Thought you might like some tea. Oh. Son of a... What's she doing here? Just let me think for a second. But Heath, she saw everything! All right, shut up! Let me... look... look. They already think she's crazy, right? Okay, so... so nothing changes. Okay. We just need to get you out of here and I need to get the cops here so... go grab my phone. - Okay. - It's in the kitchen. Give me the knife. So, you're Heath again? You're not Jacob Vance? Shut up! Ivy, hurry up! I'm looking! She seems like a real catch. Is this, is this for her? Is this all for... Sit down, Katrina. Sit down. What is this f-for money? No. I have student loans, you-you own this house, the cars. I do. So, it's something... what-what does that leave? My... my stock options? You're having me committed over a glorified IOU? Th-those are worthless, unless... Unless? Unless Zoink goes public. You really had no idea, did you? Yeah, you should talk to Wally a little more often. After he's had a few drinks. He let it slip. Zoink is going public. In a few months, you are gonna be a multi-millionaire. Well, actually, I am, and you're gonna be in a padded cell with... without friggin' shoelaces, all right? So, Ivy, would you friggin'... I got it. I got it. - Oh! - Ah! Katrina! Money's nice, but all I really want is to be rid of you! Ugh! Ah! Come here! Ah! Bitch! Katrina!! Katrina! Where are you?! - Ah! - What did you make me do? What have you done? - What? - Where is she? - Heath! - Where is she? - Behind you! Heath, help me. Ah, thank you, officer. I just heard from the hospital. Ivy's willing to testify. Hmm, I guess getting stabbed will really sour a relationship. Hmm. Yeah, well, you cracked his head pretty damn good with that baseball bat. Whenever he wakes up, he's going away for a very long time. Good. I still can't believe everything you were saying was true. I mean, it was and it wasn't. Well, why don't we start from the top? And this time, I promise to hear you out. Thank you. Come on, let's go. So, it was Heath and not a twin? Ha! Katrina. Hi, Brand. What brings you here? Big day. I officially sold all of my Zoink shares and quit an hour later. Congrats! Thank you! But that's not even the good news. Ha! You finished your book. Yes. You even signed it. "To the second-biggest baseball fan in town." - I mean. - Hmm, nice. Please let me know what you think. Oh, I will. Good, because I definitely need your help on the next one. Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. It's called "My Husband's Two Faces" and it has a plot twist that you will not believe.
