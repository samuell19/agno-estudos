You need to be a little careful. The law will be enforced any day now... I am not selling my property, Majumdar Then form a Trust. Even that takes time. All the other landlords are doing it. Pakhi... Pakhi... Pakhi... Where were you lost? How long have you been up? I have been up for ten minutes, but you were staring into space, moving the fan like a statue. How are you feeling now? I am feeling fine, thank you. Did it hurt? Did I ever tell you the Bheel Raja story? No A long time ago, there lived the... mighty Raja of the Bheel tribe. Very powerful. No one could ever harm him. Everyone was afraid of him. The English made many attempts on his life. They cut him with swords, they slit him with a thousand arrows, but he just wouldn't die. Then they heard that the Raja... confined his 'life' in a parrot. But there were a thousand parrots in the forest. Which one would it be? Then they sent a spy. A beautiful one. The Raja fell in love with her. Married her. One fine day she found 'the' parrot. She got hold of it and... Then? Then he died. Pakhi, you are my that parrot. If anything happens to you... You know, finally Manikpur has electricity. I see. And how long is it going to stay? What? Stick to the left side. Slowly. We don't want to have an accident. If we get into an accident then you were driving. If not then I was driving. Watch out! Watch out. Pakhi. You will get me fired. Watch out Watch out That motor... What are you doing? Shh... Doctor Uncle Pakhi, you can go home. He's alright. He'll be okay. Ok Move. Why? You almost killed the poor motorcyclist. You don't know how to drive. Me? Then who? Me? Come. "The springs came and went." "But I didn't experience a single one." "My heart was drenched this time." "I wonder what you did?" What's wrong? The filament got damaged. Filament? The thing that lights up. Isn't that electricity? The electricity lights the filament, the filament lights up the bulb. Oh, yes. I knew that. So whatever it is, install it everywhere. And give the bills to Majumdar. You aren't being serious. If the Zamindari Abolishment Act is passed... ...you will be left with nothing. The Act won't be passed, Majumdar. It will. There aren't any landlords in government who will support you. Why do our fathers keep arguing? My father feels that Zamindar uncle doesn't understand him and Zamindar uncle feels that my father keeps yakking. I see. Yakking? Yes? My name is Varun Srivastava Where have you come from? You stay here. Babu, someone has come from Delhi. From where? Some 'English' place. He is an archeologist. Wants to excavate our temple site He thinks there is an ancient civilization buried underneath. So? He's coming home for dinner tonight Ask him yourself. Varun Shrivastava. Yes? Don't look back The driver who drove into you, his name is Babu Singh. Ok. And what is your name? Don't try to be smart, because you are not. Ok. Which one are you? Mr. Srivastava Yes? You are very punctual This is my daughter, Pakhi And Pakhi, he is that gentleman I told you about. Hello. Hello. She wants to be a writer She's not bad. She has written her name on all my books. Baba, I am good. I am sure So, Archaeologists. I always thought they were old men. Busy amidst the cobwebs of archaic buildings. I guess that's why the name starts with 'Archaic' Of course. Where are you staying? At the Circuit House. Nearby the temple. What happened to your head? My motorcycle had an accident with a car. In Manekpur? Yes. Who was driving? I was driving. If you drive both of them at the same time... I was driving the motorcycle. Of course. Coffee? Yes And some bad amateur was driving the car. Couldn't spot a motorcycle on such a wide road I don't think these amateurs should be allowed... Sorry. I'll get some cold water. Sorry about that Even the villagers here are quite used to her driving lessons. But... For days together, the kitchen remained silent For days together, the blind dog slept hungry For days together the lizards crawled on the walls. For days together, even the rats were brought to the brink Food came home, after days together Smoke filled the courtyard after days together Rooms sparkled again, after days together The crow spread his wings, after days together Baba Nagarjuna. Real name Vaidyanath Mishra Lives in Darbhanga, my native village. Where did you say, you are staying? I'm impressed, Varun Babu. This mansion instead of that guest house. Are you understanding anything, Debdas Mukherjee? I can understand everything. My parents talk exactly like this. Learn Bengali You'll have to learn one day Have you seen Baazi? No You should watch it. Now that's what you call a movie. Dev Anand plays a gambler. And a moment comes when he has to choose. A hell lot of money or his sister's life. Or he has to quit everything, for his love. He's an amazing actor. And an even better fighter. You want to see how he fights? Like this, while swaying... No matter how many goons attack him they will not spoil his hairstyle. "Why are you scared of the world?" This temple's 500 years old. Nobody is allowed to build or demolish anything here. This famous Radha-Krishna... ...idol is the legacy of my Roy Chouhdry ancestry. It's at least three hundred years old. This... This is where we start excavating. And we can put up the camp here. We would need some labourers. Definitely So this is where we dig Do what? Digging Good Now, do you guys know how to dig? Sir. What have we got all this for? Very good But why are we going to dig? Well... because this is land and... "Try your luck." Pull more. Go further back "So what if the oars of your boat are broken." "Use your arms as the oars." "Use your arms as the oars." "If you trust yourself, try your luck." "Try your luck." "Take a chance and mend your fate." "If you trust yourself, try your luck." "Try your luck." News from the capital. In a historic decision today the government of India... ...announced the Zamindari Abolition Act. One of the prominent lawyers from the High Court... ...Mr. Rao added that according to this Act... the Landlords will be allowed no more than fifteen acres for themselves. Many landlords from Uttar Pradesh and Bengal... Will they seize the orchard? Yes. What will they do with it? Divide it amongst the villagers... Free fruits for all. My stomach is growling. No one eats before the first fish is caught. Tradition, you see. Of course. - Of course. Varun Babu. You are looking in the wrong direction, Varun babu. Are you mad? I was just looking. I saw how you were 'looking' How was I looking? It's that 'look' Things happen. Nothing happens your hunger has gone to the brain. Why are you getting upset? I am just adding to the stuff you are already cooking up... I am not cooking up anything. You are not cut out for this painting stuff? Neither are you Raja, nor Ravi Varma. You carry that blank canvas everywhere. But you never put any paint on it. My dear friend, Debdas One day I will paint my masterpiece. And the world will watch. I want to learn painting. Why the sudden interest? Its not sudden. I've always been interested. You keep talking about. I've always told you, I wanted to learn You never told me. I did You never listen to me. Fine. Ask Majumdar Babu, he'll get someone Ask Devyani also Devyani only wants to cook. And there's no need to look for anyone. Varun Babu is a great painter Finish your tea. How do I look? Very beautiful. Now go. Now what? Just go Have you tried to paint before? I mean, when you used to study in Shantiniketan. You know that I used to study in Shantiniketan? No. As in since you are the Zamindar's daughter. I learnt a little. So what do you want to learn from me? You tell me. Lets begin with landscapes. They are easy to grasp. Then once you get a hang of it... No. After mangoes and apples, the first thing they taught us was Landscapes. Can't we learn portraits? You don't think I know how to paint a landscape? Shall I show you? You know how to paint. I don't know how to paint leaves. Leaves! They are really easy Show me. Sure Take some green Take some black What is this? Leaves This? Its Modern Art. You don't know how to paint, do you? So you are a teacher to him? For the class to run, someone has to be a teacher Someone is too smart for his own good. I always wanted to learn painting. And this is a good opportunity. No? Of course. "The breeze is against the ambiance." "Because the bees stole the nectar from the buds." "Life feels different today." "So, why don't I take this chance and..." "Mend the condition of my heart." "Mend the condition of my heart." "The breeze is against the ambiance." "Because the bees stole the nectar from the buds." "Life feels different today." "So, why don't I take this chance and..." "Mend the condition of my heart." "Mend the condition of my heart." "The courtyard's filled with a new ray of light."

"Because the bees stole the nectar from the buds." "Life feels different today." "So, why don't I take this chance and..." My father calls me Pakhi Express Because I'm always in a hurry What do you want to do? I want to write. Lots and lots of books. Sometimes, I feel like running away to our house in Dalhousie. And just keep writing there. While the snow keeps falling outside, Inside I keep writing... - Writing and more writing... The Raja there has a big palace. Jandhrighat palace. That Raja is very rich. Much more than my father. And he also has an ancient unique Ganesha idol Is it? Made of pure gold. At least five hundred years old. Do you like what you do? This is all I know. I've never known anything other than this. If you get a chance to do something else, What would you do? Tell me... I want to see Chandratal before I die. Where is that? Beyond Manali. Deep in the Himalayas Clear blue waters, And not a sound. None at all? No And? I want to paint a masterpiece that the world will remember. Really? Yes. Don't tell anyone. And if I tell? It's a flat tyre. Will take sometime. What happened? Pakhi? Why didn't you tell me? "Flying away on paper wings" "It's heading where it shouldn't." "It can't understand the delicate heart." "Because it's under an illusion." "Doesn't see, think, or know... restrictions." "Lost its way, what a fool the heart is." "Flying away on paper wings" "It's heading where it shouldn't." Pakhi is a good girl. "Because it's under an illusion." And you will have to break her heart "Doesn't see, think, or know... restrictions." "Lost its way, what a fool the heart is." She will be shattered when you leave. "Lost its way, what a fool the heart is." And if I say that I love her? You aren't allowed to love, Mr. Srivastava If you want to love, you need permission. And that stone-hearted uncle won't give it to you. "It can conquer all forts, break through walls." "Love's a beautiful thing." "It tosses the heart around now and then." "The heart feels more like a ball." "It accepts every grief with a smile." "Because it's under an illusion." "Doesn't see, think, or know... restrictions." "Lost its way, what a fool the heart is." Start digging in the opposite direction first. Start here first Madam Let's go. Varun Babu No class today? Yes. Our work is about to finish. There isn't enough time. We can learn here also.

You still own a lot of assets that are very valuable. There are a lot of buyers out there I can help you? The government wants to destroy us.
