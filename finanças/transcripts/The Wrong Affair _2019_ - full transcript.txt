(dramatic music) (crying) - Mom, help me, help me! - Let her go! I came alone nobody knows that I'm here. - Mom. - She's innocent! (cocking gun) Please don't! (screams) (dramatic music) You almost ready he'll be here any minute. (dramatic music) - [Daughter] Dad's not even here yet. - [Dad] Hey, hey. - [Son] Dad! - You guys ready for the time of your lives? Bring your swim trunks? - [Son] Mom made me pack everything. - [Dad] Speaking of packing everything? You really need all of this? - I need options dad. - It's like lifting a baby hippo. What's wrong with her? - She's just adjusting to the divorce. - Well, it's not final. - You're filing papers. - That's what people do when they separate. - Well, you're the one who wants this divorce Kevin. It's not what I want. - I can't do this right now okay? - There's never a good time you're always busy with something. - Actually, it's my career that's constantly taking a back seat for you. - Come on, you can't have time to just talk to me? - I did, you never listen. - Okay, let's not do this in front of the kids. - [Kevin] Exactly. - [Son] Bye mom. - Bye. I'll miss you! Anna watch your brother! - [Dad] Mexico here we come! (speaking foreign language) - Have fun! (dramatic music) (phone vibrating) Hi. - Stephanie you're gonna break a nail using that old typewriter. - I wrote my first novel on this, it's lucky. - I sure hope so 'cause you need a best-seller. You free of the kids? - They just left. - Alright, then let's do this. ♪ Say yeah ♪ (laughing) The men in this place are smoking! - You never pay attention. - Oh, cheer up with the kids gone you have time to focus on your book. And I as your agent suggest you hurry up 'cause you got a deadline with the publisher. - This is the first time the kids have been on vacation without me. (laughs) - Is this the Stephanie I signed straight out of college? Wild, free, naughty, she was fun. - She grew up, got married, had kids. - [Shelley] And now she gets her life back. - I have my career. - And how supportive has Kevin been of your career? He was always in the office, never around when you were dealing with the kids. - He's very busy. - [Shelley] He's never even read your books. - He thinks reading the jacket cover counts. - My point exactly. - I think you have an admirer. ♪ Say yeah ♪ - [Shelley] Oh no, he's looking your way. Go say hello. - He's way too young. - He's perfect. In his sexual prime. Unlike men our age, willing to do anything to please you all night long. (laughing) - [Stephanie] Come on. - Hey, what was the name of that woman in your first book? The one who dated younger guys? - Vanessa. - Yes, Vanessa. Vanessa was a modern woman who took what she wanted. She embraced life to the fullest, saving every moment. You wrote that. - And then I killed her in the end because she was the embodiment of unrealistic desires. - Her body was never found. she could have survived. - Maybe. But I don't want a boy toy. (scoffs) - Okay, time to get real. You're getting divorced and that may not be your choice, but why should you suffer alone while Kevin has all the fun? The truth is right now, in this moment, you are a single woman. Embrace it. (laughs) To embracing it! (laughing) - So tomorrow night dinner and a movie? - I would, but you need to write. Publisher wants the first draft before Christmas. - But I need inspiration. - Cheap bottle of wine, get you some candles, bye. - I forgot my phone I have to go back in. Goodnight. (chatter) - Well hello. I was hoping you'd come back. I found this on the table. I'm Brady. - Thanks Brady. - And you are? - Vanessa. - So do you have to go right away or? - I should. - School night? - Summer break. - Then let me buy you a drink. - I'm at my limit. - Dessert then, finish off the evening with something sweet. - You are way too young. - 26. And I hear the chocolate cake is enticing. - Only if we share. So what is it you do? Sterling College? - No, a little bit of everything, mainly investments. - Into? - Anything I find interesting, what about you? - I write. Blogs. About food, drinks, anything really if a moment strikes me as interesting I write about it. - Life is about finding those special moments. If I hadn't seen your phone on the table. If you hadn't come back to get it. If you hadn't stayed for dessert. This has become a moment. - So it seems. - So Vanessa what are you really looking for? - I like surprises. - You want to go somewhere? - Thank you for dessert Brady, it was nice meeting you. - At least give me your number. - Good night Brady. - Vanessa, forgetting something? - I swear I put that in my purse. (soft music) (laughing) (soft music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Don't go. (soft music) - I'm sorry, but I gotta go. - I'll be waiting for your call. (soft music) - Book Steven for next Thursday and tell Dan I'll have a copy of the new hardback artwork on Tuesday. - He hates the artwork. - He's a writer. Tell him to leave the marketing to us. (phone vibrating) (typewriter keys clicking) Whoa, it sounds like you're writing. That's great. - I am on a roll Shel, you remember how they didn't find Vanessa's body in the river? It's because she's still alive. - I like that, I like that a lot. - I feel like I should resurrect Vanessa. She's just got so much life to live. - [Shelleyl] Hey, you sound different. What's going on with you? - I took the advice from an old friend. - Which advice I've given you so much? (chuckles) - Hey, I want to finish this chapter, I'll call you back. (upbeat music) It's beautiful, thank you. (upbeat music) (soft music) - This bridge is a really special place to me. - Really, why is that? - It's one of the places my parents used to bring me when I was a kid. (cell phone alert) - Sorry. - It's okay. So tomorrow, I was thinking we would go to these shops and we would just hang out all day just go from shop to - I'm sorry but I've got a friend coming over tomorrow. - Who? - Just a friend. (soft music) - Okay. - Hi, come here. How was your trip? - So great, we went swimming, hiking, on a speedboat, I saw a huge shark! - Hey mom. Yeah, and it was fun, we missed you. And it was a nurse shark maybe two feet, that barely counts. - Does too, it has teeth. - All shark have teeth. - Well all sharks don't. - It's still teeth buddy. - It's called, look it up. Whatever. Mom, I have so many pictures to show you. - Yeah, I got him a camera, he's got a good eye. - And me a new phone. Hey, I'm gonna go call Jenny. - Can I use the computer to download all my new pictures? - Sure. I thought we were gonna talk about the phone thing? - I know, she just. Can we talk? Civilly? Just being gone has made me think about us, the kids, everything. - So you signed the papers? - No, and I don't want to. Look the whole time we were at that resort I just kept thinking, you should be there with us, you know? Didn't feel right, didn't feel complete. And babe I miss everything about you. You've been right about it all. I'm not there for you enough, I do work too much, I'm not here for the kids. I mean you and me we're good together. We really make a good team. And our kids they need two parents that love each other, are there for each other. Now all of this this is gonna make us stronger. I mean I want to be able to put this ring back on, forever. Can we can we give this, can we give it a second chance? Please? (soft music) - Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes. - Yes? Oh babe, babe. (soft music) (dramatic music) Because I love you so much. - I love you too. - Is dad moving back in? - Yes I am buddy. (laughing) Come here! (dramatic music) Oh it feels so good to be home. - I am so sorry but I have plans with Shelley tonight. - You're actually gonna go out right now? - It'll be quicker if I just get it out of the way, an hour tops. - Well yeah, but we can just, gotta do what you got to do. (dramatic music) (soft music) (chatter) - Brady we need to talk. I'm sorry but I haven't been completely honest with you. I was, I am, I was separated. And my husband is, he's back and he wants to make it work. You are an awesome guy. You made me feel alive. But I have a responsibility to my family and a history with my husband that I just, I can't give up. I'm sorry. We have to end this. - No, if you were serious about your marriage you wouldn't have been with me in the first place. - Sorry. Think of it as a summer romance. Something that was really fun but it just could never last. - I don't care if you are married. What we have is real. I care about you. I love you. - I'm sorry Brady I just, I don't feel the same way about you. - No, I can't accept that. You're just looking for an easy way out. - You are gonna find somebody your own age and you're gonna forget all about me. (techno music) I have to go. (techno music) (dramatic music) - Hey Dad! It's the first day of school I can't be late! - [Kevin] Yep, I'm coming! - [Son] Thanks. - You ready? - I was born ready. - Alright kiddo, meet you in the car. - First day of school. - [Kevin] I know they grow up so fast. What's that? Mm. Peanut buttery. - I love you. - Love you too. Have a great day writing. (slow blues music) Hello ladies. - Hi dad. - Hi. - Where's Robby? - It's Friday remember? Tyler's birthday party sleepover. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, I knew that. Nice kicks. - Thanks. I'm putting myself in Vanessa's shoes. Role playing has really helped with writer's block. Do you have a problem with it? - Not at all. Kinda sexy actually. - Kinda? (chuckles) What are you doing home early? - Well you are looking at the newest member of the EFWP. That is the Environmentally Friendly Work Program at the office, which gives me the ability to work from home four or five days a month, so I opted in. - That's great. You can help me split time with the kids, driving them. - I did mention that I was working from home right? Working. Vanessa back from the dead? - She faked her death and is making up for lost time by using her take-no-prisoners attitude with men to a whole new level. - She was a real bitch in the first book I'll tell you that. - As if you read it. She wanted to be fulfilled. - Yeah, sexually. - She was trapped in an identity that she didn't choose for herself. She had to take a stand and being strong does not make her a bitch. - Touche. - You know what? My drink is out why don't you top it up for me? - At your service. - Dad, could you also get us a refill too? - [Kevin] No, you are young enough to get your own. (scoffs) - Mom? - Shelley it's the first week of school and my nights are jammed can I just get a little extension please? - [Shelley] Fine I'll ask, but this had better be your best work. - New York Times bestseller. - [Shelley] Promises, promises, bye. - Mom. - Anna you're home early? - Yeah, it was a half-day which you clearly forgot. But Jenny just got her permit, she drove us. - I'm sorry. - Hey, I wanted to introduce you to someone. (dramatic music) - It's a pleasure to meet you Mrs. Peterson. (dramatic music) - Mom! Are you okay? (dramatic music) - I've read all your books, I'm a big fan. - Mom! - I'm just shocked. I didn't think it would be your demographic. - I'm gonna get changed. We're going to the mall. - Okay, bye. - Let me help you. - I don't need your help. - I don't mind. - What are you doing here, how did you find me? - You said you like surprises. - No, not like this. - [Brady] Why not? - What are you doing with my daughter? - You said to find someone my own age. - She is in high school. - So am I, senior. - How old are you? - Old enough to know we would be good together. - I told you this is done, I have family! - Lots of women are marrying younger men. - [Stephanie] I told - I'm ready. - You look great, doesn't she look great Mrs. Peterson? - [Anna] Bye mom. - [Jenny] See you Ms. Peterson. - Be seeing you. - [Stephanie] So how was the mall? - [Anna] It was fun. Brady bought me this charm bracelet. - You barely know him. - Mom, he is the hottest boy in school. He just moved here and everyone's talking about him. And he likes me. - Brady seems too mature for you. - What, what, who's Brady? - Anna's new boyfriend. - Knock it off, and no, he's not my boyfriend yet. Although he did ask me tonight. - When did this happen? - This afternoon. But don't worry, I told him we should probably have a few more dates before we make anything official. - So Brady asked you out? - Yeah, I was surprised too. - Who's Brady? - Brady is the new boy in school. - He's a man. - What, how old is he? - He's only one year older than me. - So he's 18. - Yeah, I think so. - You should probably just stay focused on school for now. - Your father's right. I want you to stay focused on school, not Brady. - Why are you guys so against him liking me? - Other boys can like you, just don't date Brady! - How can you say that mom? - I know his type and I want you to stay away from him, you need to listen to me! - You know what just forget it, I'm not hungry! - Steph, we should probably give her the benefit of the doubt here. We don't even know the kid he's probably perfectly nice. - No, he is not nice. Anna! Anna I'm concerned, I want you to think about this boy, you barely know him. - He's a nice guy mom. - How do you know? - Because I do! Gosh, a guy likes me and you act like it's the end of the world. Besides Brady is just a friend, not my boyfriend. - Maybe it's best you stay away from him all together okay? - Yeah, and who's next? Jenny? - No. Just Brady. - Hey you alright? - Yeah, I'm worried about Anna. - She's smart. Besides you know kids these days, it'll probably over in a week. - I'm glad you're back. - It feels so good to be back. (phone alert) Who's that? - It's Shelley. - What's she calling this late for? - I'm near the deadline. - Oh. (phone ringing) - Hi. - [Brady] Hey, what's going on? - Yeah no, I'm working on that. - [Brady] What's the matter? You can't talk. Kevin is there isn't he? You've really let him back in? - Listen, can will you talk about this tomorrow? Great. I'm sorry, I told her not to call so late. - Yeah, no problem. - I'm just gonna take a shower. (dramatic music) - What's that? - I don't know. - Probably just dad. (cell phone ringing) - Leave it. - Well what if it's important? - It's not, just leave it. - [Anna] I can put it on silent for you. - Anna I want you to break up with Brady. - What? - I know his type and he's just gonna break your heart. - You hardly even know him mom. - I know enough to know that he's not right for you. - Whatever. - Honey I'm serious, I don't want you to get hurt. - Yeah sure you don't. (cell phone ringing) (doorbell ringing) (dramatic music) - What are you doing here? - You told Anna to break up with me so we could be together. - Not so we could be together. I want you out of my life. - Stephanie listen, make love to me one more time and after if you can honestly say that you still don't feel anything for me, then I'll leave you alone. - Get in here. Listen to me, you have to let me go. You're young, you think that you love me but it's just a chemical thing. It's not real. As you get older you will realize that so please just leave me and my daughter alone. - How do you know it won't work? We haven't even tried. I've never felt this way about anyone. Surely that means something. - Brady I don't love you. - But how can you love your husband even though he can't satisfy you the way that I can? - Look Brady, I can't, I can't! (dramatic music) Brady you have to go! Go now. - I know you have feelings for me. Kevin isn't right for you! You have to realize this. (dramatic music) Please, think about us. (dramatic music) - Hey! You okay? - [Stephanie] Yeah, you just startled me. - I'm so sorry, I'm just very, very excited right now. - [Stephanie] What's going on? - [Kevin] I have got huge news. (dramatic music) I just landed a new client. - What? - An investment bank. And I'm gotta tell you something, my commission check today alone was $ 50,000. - What? - Yes! Oh my God. (dramatic music) - [Stephanie] Oh my God. - I love you so much. - [Stephanie] I love you. - Fork on the right or left? - Left. - Right. - No, she means left. (cellphone alert) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - I was just about to go to bed. - So did you break up with Brady? - Yeah, mom I did. - Well it's probably for the best. You should just focus on school, it's a big year. And then college next year. - I know mom, it's fine he's just another boy. It's not like I loved him or anything. - Yeah, well okay, sleep well. Good night. - Night. (text message sending on phone) (soft music) - Anna in bed? - Yep. - She doing okay? She was little quiet at dinner tonight, even with the good news. - She broke up with Brady. - Oh, well kind of don't like her having a boyfriend anyway to be honest. So, hmm. - What? - The bills are paid, got a little extra money in the bank. Shall we celebrate, huh? - What is this? - You know, a little champagne, some jazz, romance. (soft music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (cellphone ringing) - Kevin. - [Kevin] Anna called and asked if she could study with Brady this afternoon. - You told her no right? - [Kevin] No, I said it was okay. - Why would you do that? We agreed Brady's a bad influence on her. - [Kevin] I met him this morning at drop off, he seems like a nice kid to me. - No, Kevin he's not. - [Kevin] How do you know? I mean we just met the kid. - Mother's intuition. I don't want him around Anna. - [Kevin] Okay, sorry I should've checked - It's fine. I'll call Anna and tell her to come home. - [Anna On Voicemail] Hi it's Anna, leave a message. - Anna it's mom. I need you to come home after school. I just need your help with some things, call me. (dramatic music) - Beat it. - Whatever jerk. - Hey, be nice to my friends. - It's fine. I was done anyway. - Anna. - I can't get back with you Brady. - What did I do wrong? I really like you. - It's not you it's just, I can't be in a relationship right now. - Is that you talking or your mother? - She doesn't want me to be with you. - Anna we'll go slow. If you're worried about having sex then we won't. Just give it some time, I'm sure your mom will like me. - No, I just, I've got a lot to do. I have got SAT prep, I've got to keep my grades up for college. - Anna I won't get in the way of any of that. I really like you, let's just spend some time together. Don't let your mother's hesitations She forgets what it's like to be alive. - You know that's my favorite? - So that's a yes. - Maybe. - Go! (laughing) (dramatic music) - Anna off the phone. (dramatic music) - It's just Jenny. (dramatic music) - Now. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (door opening) (dramatic music) Hello? (dramatic music) Kevin? Hello? (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - You brought her back. - Put those down! - [Brady] Oh, is this the only copy? - How did you get in? - The front door blew open. I rang the bell. - No, you didn't. - Must be broken. - What do you want? - Truce. - I didn't start this. - Talking with Anna, she said that you married young. And now your writing is just a way to live out your fantasies, because you are not happy. - That's not true. - Come on, after everything we've been through. Each character you write has some truthful aspect of you in it. Carla, the architect. She's the cautious part of you. And Madison is the intellectual filled with theories and ideas. And well, we both know who Vanessa is. But who am I? Marc, a strong man with little to say. No, I don't think so. Maybe John, the mysterious rich man who only wants one thing. - You are nothing. Nothing! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Our love is real. Kevin doesn't love you. Oh, no, no, none of that. He left you. You'll come to realize this. I promise. (dramatic music) I love you. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Anna, I'm gonna need you on the green beans here in a minute. - [Anna] Just a sec. - Hi honey. I checked on you earlier, you were passed out cold. You feeling all right? (soft music) - Hey. Hey Brady yeah. No, it's already over. (dramatic music) (laughing) (dramatic music) (chatter) (dramatic music) - [Brady] That's a nice car Mr. Peterson. - Oh yeah. Yeah, you work hard enough, you're gonna have one just like her. - I intend to, already applied to college. - Oh yeah, what are you studying? - Finance. - Get out of here. That's what I had a degree in. It's boring as hell but, pays off. - I know. - Hey. I'm ready. - Have a good day Mr. Peterson. Where are you guys going? - The lake. - [Kevin] Alright, be safe. - Of course. - Bye. (dramatic music) - Where is she going? - On a date. - We agreed, no Brady. - That's not exactly what I said. - Yes it is. - Honey, she's 17 years old. I mean I don't like it any more than you do but we have to let her have some fun. - She needs to focus on school right now. This is a very critical time for her. - I couldn't agree more. But she already gets straight A's. What I'm more concerned about right now is how we're going to pay her tuition when she goes off to college next year. Speaking of which. How's your book coming? - It's not. - [Anna] Thank you for dinner, I had a lot of fun tonight. - Anna, if you want to take it slowly. (laughs) - [Anna] Bye. - [Brady] Well hello. (dramatic music) - You raped me, don't ever touch me again. You raped me! You raped me! - Don't! I didn't touch you, you fell asleep. And I might've peeked. - Don't ever touch me again. - Or what? What are you gonna do? - I'll call the police. - And tell them what? That you slept with a high school student. Stephanie just spend some time with me and if you don't feel anything, then I'll leave you alone. - Never. (dramatic music) - [Shelley] So you didn't sound good on the phone. What's going on with you? - Well, when Kevin and the kids were away this summer I kind of had a fling. - Kind of or not? - Vanessa did. - I don't follow. - I was pretending to be Vanessa. It was like wearing a mask. I convinced myself that everything Vanessa did I wouldn't be responsible for. - So how was it? Tell me everything, leave nothing out. - No, it's not okay. When Kevin came back I broke up with the guy and now he won't go away. I care about my family and if Kevin finds out that I slept with this guy, or Anna. - Okay, first you have nothing to feel guilty about. At the time you were with this guy Kevin had left and divorce papers were filed. Right? - Yeah. - And when Kevin came back you did the right thing, you dumped this guy, so what's the problem? - He won't leave me alone. Shelley, when Kevin and the kids were out he broke into the house and drugged me. - Stephanie, what are you doing? He broke in and drugged you? That's a crime. - I know. - [Shelley] Call the police. - I can't. - And why not? - He's in high school. - High school? Steph, I said young but is he under 18? - No, please, I need a little more time for the book. I just need to get this whole mess sorted out, please. - They're not gonna be happy but I'll buy you a couple of weeks, but Stephanie you've got to tell Kevin. It's better he hears it from you first. (dramatic music) - Guys settle down. Be ready okay? - Where's Robby? - He's already been picked up. - By whom? - I don't know, he was really excited and he said his ride was here, so I dismissed him. - And you didn't see which car he got into? - I'm so sorry, no. - You are supposed to be watching these kids. (dramatic music) Kevin if you have Robby please call me back, he wasn't at the school. (dramatic music) - [Anna On Voicemail] Hi, it's Anna. - Don't send me to voicemail Anna, come on. (dramatic music) Robby! (dramatic music) Robby! (dramatic music) Robby? (dramatic music) - Brought him home safe and sound. - [Robby] Brady took me for ice cream. Thanks Brady. - I saved you a trip to school, didn't Kevin tell you? - No. (dramatic music) Only authorized people are supposed to pick up my kids from school. - Kevin said it's fine. Well, Anna's waiting for me at the mall, we've got a date. - I will call the police if you don't leave us alone. - I'd love to talk to them. Bye. (dramatic music) - Hey babe, so sorry I'm late. We got this merger going on between a company here and one in Beijing and the time difference is in this. (laughs) - Why did you have Brady pick up Robby from school? - Why would I tell him to do that? He's not our family, I wouldn't have him pick our son up from school. Robby got home okay right? - Yeah. - Thank God for that. - I need to talk to you about something. - Sure. (soft music) - This is really hard to say. (soft music) (phone vibrating) I'll turn it off, give me a second. (dramatic music) Give me a couple minutes, I'll make it fast. - Hey Doug, what's up buddy? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no I got the numbers right here. (dramatic music) It's executive. (dramatic music) They did! (dramatic music) - [Anna] Coming I got to grab my backpack. - Thank you. - [Kevin] Honey. - Have a good day. - [Kevin] Always. - Bye mom. - Bye. - Come on buddy, hustle. where's your sister at? - [Robby] I don't know. - She said we were in a hurry. I forgot my phone, I'll be right back, hang tight. I'm losing my mind. - Hey, aren't you gonna be late? - Yes I am but I can't find my phone. Anna? - What? - Is my phone on the table up there? (dramatic music) - Is that the garage door closing? - Yeah, but shouldn't be I left the car running. - [Stephanie] Robby's in there the car can't be left running. Open the door, get him out. - I'm trying but it's stuck. - What do you mean? Here. Robby! Robby, Robby! (dramatic music) - I'm gonna go check the back door. (dramatic music) (coughing) (dramatic music) - Steph, where's your clicker? (dramatic music) - Get out of the car, oh my God. Are you okay? - [Kevin] I'm gonna turn this off. - Robby, you okay? (coughing) Can you breathe, are you okay? - Mom, I'm fine, I'm fine, really. (dramatic music) - Is he okay? - I think so. - I'm perfectly fine. I'm not a baby, why are y'all freaking out? - It's just extremely dangerous to be in a closed garage with the car running, those fumes can kill you. Why did you close the garage? - I didn't. - How could you leave the garage door shut? - I didn't leave the garage door shut, it was wide open when - Is Robby okay? - He'll be okay. - Yeah. - Alright, dad we should have left five minutes ago. Come on. - Well you're gonna be late today. How did the garage door get closed? - I don't know, it just did. - That's not possible. - Let's go pal. Oh hey, your key. By the way your garage door opener, it's missing. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - It's time to finish this. - I was surprised to get your call. - [Stephanie] Let's walk. Lied to you, I led you on, I was wrong. - [Robby] So you're gonna take my proposal? - [Stephanie] How much? - What do you mean? - I brought you a check to disappear from my family. How much how? How much? - You can't buy me. - [Stephanie] Everybody has a price. - I want you. - [Stephanie] You are stalking my family. - [Brady] Let me be a part of it, I know we can make this work. - You're sick. - I like this new you, it gets me off. You know the deal, be with me one more time. - I will never be with you! - You control our destiny Stephanie. Leave Kevin he doesn't love you like I do! - This is my first million dollar deal. And everybody knows that all the big deals go down on the golf course, not in the boardroom right? - Sure, sure. - Well by the time we get to the ninth hole all three of these Alaskan businessmen have heatstroke. So the moral of this story is you never go golfing in Arizona in the dead of summer. (laughing) - Hey, what's going on? - Oh honey I had the craziest blowout on the freeway. I almost drove my car right off the road. Thank God Brady passed by man, I'll tell you that. - It's a small world isn't it? - That it is. If you want to you're welcome to stay for dinner. It's my night to cook, so I always order in. I'm gonna do Chinese, maybe Thai, what do you like better? - No. We have other plans tonight. - Yeah, I should probably go Mr. Peterson. - Brady, you know we would love to meet your parents sometime. (dramatic music) Why don't you give me their number and that way I can call and formally introduce myself. What do you think? Maybe this weekend we could do a big, happy, family gathering. I would love to meet your mom, I bet we'd get along great. - Steph I. - Don't you think? At this point mothers should meet and talk. - My father is on an extended work trip. But, maybe when he gets back. Bye Mr. Peterson. - Thanks again kid. If you're free this weekend I'd be happy to take you down to the club, hit the driving range, on me of course. - Yeah, sounds fun. - Honey. - What? - He told me that his mom is dead, I just. - I don't think that's true. - Why would he lie? - It makes a better story. - This isn't a novel. - Some people gain sympathy any way they can. - What? (sighs) (soft music) - Hey Jenny. - Hi Ms. Peterson. - Anna told me you got a job here so I thought I'd come in, say hi, grab a coffee. Hey do you know anything about Brady, Anna's new boyfriend? - I stay away from him. He's not nice to me or anyone but Anna. He's barely at school anyway. - How so? - Shows up late, leaves around lunch. I'm not sure what classes he takes. - Does he have any classes with Anna? - I'm not sure. Once they started going out he was rude to me, told me to get lost. Anna and I don't talk anymore. - Do you know his last name? - No, sorry. - Thanks, I'll take that coffee to go. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (soft music) (dramatic music) - [Older Man] Don't you lie to me boy, you're stealing from me! - I'm not, I didn't take anything from you. - [Older Man] There's two grand missing from the safe at the garage. - I didn't take anything! And if you touch me again, I will kill you. (dramatic music) It's the last time I'm gonna see you. (dramatic music) - I'm done with you boy! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - What do you want? - I need to talk to you about Brady. - You the police? - No. - Then get out of here. Me and that boy are done. - Please. - Then I don't want to hear it. That boy done something wrong you take it up with the cops but you leave me out of it. - I'm sorry. - [Man] Get out of here! (dramatic music) - Oh hi mom. - Hey hon. - Robby go to your room so I can have a word with your sister and your father. - Ooh, can I play video games? - Go ahead. - Yes, on a school night. - What's up? - What's going on? - Sweetie you're my daughter and I love you, but you need to see this. - Is that Brady? - He's a drug dealer. - It doesn't look like he's selling drugs. - Anna open your eyes, come on. - That's a lie mom! - I saw him. - So you followed my boyfriend around? - Because we knew that something wasn't right with him and now we know. - Okay, so instead of coming and talking to me you go and follow him around and take photos. Who does that mom? - I did talk to you, you wouldn't listen. - Mom, Brady likes me and he cares about me. - [Stephanie] No he doesn't. - Yes he does mom. - I've seen this before. - Where do you come up with this stuff mom? - [Stephanie] Listen to me. - We need to calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down I know what I'm talking about. Anna until you stop seeing him you're grounded. - Grounded! You know Brady was right, you don't care about me. - Anna. - You don't. Don't mom! - Anna I'm telling the truth. - Honey. - What? - You followed him? - Well, I had to do something. You weren't doing anything. - What? - And I know he is not a good person Kevin, I know. - How? We've barely spoken two words to the kid. (dramatic music) Is there something you're not telling me? (dramatic music) - No. Go find Anna. (dramatic music) (crying) (dramatic music) (crying) (dramatic music) - Okay I just off the phone with Joyce, she's over at Jenny's, everything is fine. Honey if this kid is really selling drugs and manipulating our daughter against us, he loses my sympathy I think we are totally justified in calling the cops. - No police. - Why? - Hey guys I'm hungry. - Alright, well guess I'm gonna order some pizza and then we'll watch a movie alright? - Alright. - Don't worry everything's gonna work out. - We got to talk. - Okay. - So what did your mother say about me this time? - How do you know it's about her? - Because she's had it out to get me since day one. And she's taking her marriage out on us. Am I right? - She said you deal drugs. - Why would I do that? - I have a picture. - A picture of what? Who took that? - My mom. Is that what you're doing when you skip school in the afternoon? - I skip school because it's boring. Those are my friends, I'm not a dealer. Look, I was buying a phone off of Craigslist with the receipt and everything. - [Anna] I gotta get home. - Anna wait. Anna! Anna wait! The problem with your mother is she's put all of these ideas into her head, she's got you wound up tight. Hey, please. Look I don't deal drugs. I really care about you. You're confused and emotional because she's made you that way. (dramatic music) So don't let that come between us, okay? (dramatic music) Come on I've got a surprise for you. - Jenny's waiting for me. - Come on Anna, live in the moment. You know you want to. - Alright. (dramatic music) What does it hurt, right? (dramatic music) - The jacket cover is not approved. Fix it or my client pulls the book. Please tell me you have at least the first chapter. - No. I need some advice. Brady's dating Anna. - Say that again? - He goes to her school and they're dating. - Oh Steph, sit down. He's of legal age Stephanie, call the police. - I can't. For the first time my marriage to Kevin is working. He is really trying to be a good husband and succeeding. This could ruin everything. I can't have that. - This will ruin everything. - Brady asked for one thing and then he promised to leave us alone. - A million dollars? - To sleep with me one last time. (soft music) - Wow! - It's pretty great isn't it? - That is so nice. - [Robby] Care for a drink? - I don't drink. - Well today you do. Cheers. - Cheers. (soft music) Mm, it's good. - Great. - [Anna] Gosh. How incredible is that view? - [Robby] It's just amazing isn't it? - Yeah, that's gonna have like a knot right there. - Yeah? - Yeah. Alright, whoa there cowboy. - Hey you can do what you want it's okay. - Yeah, I know and I don't want that, stop. - Don't be like your whore mother. - Wait stop, what are you doing? - Don't be like that. - What are you doing, Brady? - Anna wait! (dramatic music) Anna! (dramatic music) - Where's Anna? - She's up there. (dramatic music) - Anna? (crying) Anna? (crying) (dramatic music) Oh sweetie. (dramatic music) Did he hurt you? - No, I don't want to talk about it. I'm so sorry. - It's okay, it's okay. (soft music) I'm so sorry. (crying) Don't tell me that you're gonna protect some criminal's rights! There should be a formal investigation or whatever you call it! - Mrs. Peterson. - Let me finish. And I do not want my daughter's names thrown around. I know how these things work, she is the victim! - Mrs. Peterson what I'm trying to tell you is Brady had already been expelled from our district. - Over this? - Actually, another situation at another school. I had no idea he was even on our campus. - What situation? - Legally I can't tell you. However I highly recommend that if there's issues going on outside of school please contact the police. Actually, let me provide you with the number to make things easier for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. (dramatic music) - By Ikea. - [Jenny] Ready ready. (dramatic music) (talking) Yeah probably. - Kevin? - I found this in my inbox! (dramatic music) Vanessa is back from the dead and has an affair with a high school student named Brady! All the illicit details. Dates, times. It's way too accurate not to be true. It even says that Vanessa is jealous of her daughter Anna dating Brady. Stephanie what is this? - He could have made that up. - Role playing, isn't that what you called it? - He made that up. - Oh yeah, did he make this up huh? Did he make that up? (dramatic music) - When you and I were separated I met Brady at a bar. - How old is this kid? - 18 okay, I wasn't breaking any laws and I thought you and I were done. - So you slept with him? - Kevin. - Answer me! - Yes. (dramatic music) - So you lose faith in us and just decide, what the hell? - Yes. But it was a mistake. I was weak, it was a moment and then you came back. And I want to make this marriage work. I chose us, and I told him it was over. - This is why you didn't want us to go to the police isn't it? So I didn't find out! - I begged him to stay away from us. I fought for Anna to stay away from him. - You are responsible for all of this! (dramatic music) (crying) - What a creep. - I should've listened to you, I'm sorry. Brady what you doing here? - [Brady] Get in the car. - Why do you have a gun, what are you doing? - Shut up and get in the car. - [Anna] Wait! What the hell? - Drive. Put the key in the car, yes there you go, drive. (dramatic music) (cell phone ringing) - You are going to jail. - [Anna] Mom! - Anna. - [Brady] Yeah, me and Anna are having an adventure aren't we? - Don't you hurt her. - [Brady] You know what I want and if you call the cops or anyone else you can say goodbye to Anna forever. - Where are you? (dramatic music) Kevin, Brady has Anna. - [Kevin] What? - Brady has Anna's she's in trouble and I think he's going after Robby too, you have to go get him. - [Kevin] No, I'm calling the police. - No don't. - [Kevin] I should have done this a long time ago! - Kevin don't! (dramatic music) - [Anna On Voicemail] Hi it's Anna, leave a message. (soft music) (crying) (soft music) - We've issued an Amber Alert. Surrounding states and local counties have been notified. Brady won't get far. - Thank you officer. - You have any idea why he would want to abduct her? - He tried to hurt her. He tried to force himself on her in a hotel room but she ran. - I'm gonna need you to stay put, if we get any news I'll give you a call. - Is Anna gonna be okay? - Yes baby she's gonna be fine, I promise. - Hey Robby buddy why don't you go on upstairs and watch some TV for a little while. I'll be up there in a minute okay? Come on. Let's go, love you. (cell phone ringing) Stephanie! (dramatic music) - [Brady] I said no police. - Kevin called the police. I didn't know about that, I'm sorry. Where's Anna? Is she okay? - [Brady] We need to meet. - Where? - [Brady] The last place you kissed me and meant it. And if I see anyone else, cops, Kevin, anyone. - [Anna] Mom! - Anna? (phone hanging up) - That son of a bitch! I'm getting the cop. - Hey, he said no cops you heard him. - What am I gonna do stand around here and do nothing? That's my daughter. - Our daughter Kevin. I am so sorry. I never meant to hurt you, or the kids, or anyone. But I have to finish this alone. - Then he's gonna hurt you. - Maybe, but if I can buy Anna just a moment to get away in exchange from my life then that's what I have to do. That's what I'm gonna do. - I'm coming with you. - He'll kill her. You heard him, I have to go alone. It'll be okay though, I promise I'm gonna be fine. - Don't go. (soft music) - Honey mommy's gonna be fine. You take care of him, he's ours too. - Where's Brady? - [Stephanie] I'm sorry. - Where is Brady? - I'll see you later. - Steph just wait, wait. We have been through so much together and through all of this I have never ever once stopped loving you. So please you have to come home with our daughter. - I love you. (dramatic music) Jenny where is she? - She's on the bridgeway. He said that if I told you where her left he'd kill her. - Stay here. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (crying) Brady, please don't okay? - Shut up. - [Stephanie] Anna! - Mom, mom please help me. - You remembered. You know that means something. And I always thought you were in denial about it. - Let her go and I'm all yours. - Now you make it sound so easy. - I came alone nobody knows that I'm here. She's innocent Brady! - I'm the victim here. My only crime was that I loved you and you lied to me. - Yes and I am sorry, I'm so sorry. - You hurt me and now it's my turn to hurt you. - Brady! No! I'm not over you. - You're a snake. - You know that it takes me a long time to make a decision. And I choose you Brady. (dramatic music) - Go on and leave. Leave! Stephanie stays. - Go! - So what do we do now? - We go home. - I don't have a home! - Together we can change that. I've met your father I know he's not good, you don't have to be like him. Be with me. I want more moments like the ones we've had together. Just us. Because I truly understand now that you love me. And I love you. - You're the only one who ever really cared about me. - Give me the gun. - There's no way out for us Stephanie, this is our end! (dramatic music) - Stay back. - You liar! (dramatic music) - [Anna] Mom! - Anna! (dramatic music) Jenny! You okay? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Come on, come on. (dramatic music) - [Kevin] Alright. - Dad. - Good got your camera huh? You have this again. - Oh dad, it is not even that heavy. - [Kevin] Hey honey. - How are the tires? - Well there was a nail in one but I got it fixed. We're all good. - Guess what came today? My new book. - Awe babe. - Shelley swears it's gonna be a best-seller. - Well I know it will be because you wrote it. (soft music) Who's ready for a Christmas vacation? - [Anna] Me! - Stephanie] Me. - [Robby] Right here. I think they'll want to go snowboarding this year. - [Stephanie] Let's go. This is gonna be so much fun. (laughter) (soft music) - [Kevin] Hang on to your hats.
