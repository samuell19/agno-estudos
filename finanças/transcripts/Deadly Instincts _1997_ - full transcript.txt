(MultiCom Jingle) (mysterious music) (meteor whooshing) (tense music) (explosions booming) (goo oozing) (creature roaring) (mysterious music) (creature growling) (ominous music) (chattering on police radio) - You know, it's not every day a meteor hits your lawn. - No, our beloved principal finally gets her 15 minutes of fame. (chuckling) - Find something? - It's just a piece of the meteor, but it's warm. - Oh, this is Lieutenant Moore, he's a friend of mine. - Ashley Rowe. (tongue clicking) - What a goddamn mess. - Lord knows how we're gonna pay for it. - Aren't we insured? - I have to go, look, there's not a lot I can do. I'll call you later. - All right, Alan, thanks for coming. - Mr. Rowe. - Lieutenant. - Tom. Let's go. - Good friends, huh? - Might be. (chattering on police radio) Lectures start tomorrow. Just make sure they board up the windows. We can't afford to have any more acts of God. (Ashley chuckles) - No rest for the wicked, huh Jake? - Yeah, tell me about it. Hey, you know she likes you, don't you? - Come on, she's not my type. Well, have a good time. I'll see you later. (students chattering) - If I flunk this, I'm dead. My parents will really kill me. - Come on already, you can't flunk art. - I can. - Don't be such a mope. You know, we didn't come all this way to have such a hard time. It'll be fun, you'll see. (Louise sighs) - Yuck. - Cute. - Such is the power of art. To shock and amaze. To delight and to terrify. And hopefully to inspire you and me to create on a higher plane. - I think we're all inspired. (students laughing) - [Ashley] Now, these African sculptures demonstrate the primal... (rocks rustling) (tense music) Survival, which over centuries, played a large role... (debris clattering) (mysterious music) - Well, well, well. Mana from heaven. (creature growling) Shit. (mysterious music) (Jack mumbles) - Jack? Jack? - Oh, shit. - What the hell are you doing down there? - Just looking. - Just looking? They don't pay you to just look. You're here to work. Now. - Yes. (mysterious music) (creature snarls) - Here. 300 bucks. But I want it back. - No problem. - Can I have one of those? - You can earn it. - Oh, what the hell. (solemn music) (bird trilling) (objects clattering) - Jesus, you made me jump. Are you okay? You're hurt. No, it's okay, I'm not gonna hurt you. You look like one of the new students. - Stay away from me. (creature growling) Leave me alone. (creature growling) No! (horn honking) (mysterious music) (bird trilling) (book thuds) - (sighs) This is hopeless, fucking hopeless. - Excuse me, Mr. Rowe? - I'm sorry, I forgot you were there. - That's okay. Can I help? - I don't know, I was looking... I saw this girl at the key side last night and I thought she might be a student. - You saw a girl last night and you don't know if she was a student? - When I say saw, I mean saw. Not that I saw. If you see what I mean. (chuckles) Forget it. What can I do to help you? - I take it those are the ones that wanna go down to the cellar, right? - Yeah, yeah. That's nice. - Okay, so I volunteered. - Okay. Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. - You all right? - Never better. (chuckles) - Boo! (Louise gasps) - Jesus, Jack! - Sorry, just a joke. - Why don't you grow up? (mysterious music) - Oh, you got a piece too. - Hasn't everyone? - Most of the girls. Add a bit of silver chain, you got yourself 20 bucks. - And maybe a whole lot more. - God knows why, but I can't seem to get enough. Of the stuff. (Ashley chuckles) (Louise screams) (mysterious music) - The hell was that? (ominous music) (Louise crying) (rat squeaking) - Don't just stand there! Get it away from me! (Louise crying) - Get out of here, come on! (Louise crying) You better clean this up, I'm gonna go make sure she's okay. - You get to have all the fun. - [Ashley] Hey! - Here, ratty, ratty, ratty. What do I got for you? - Louise? Louise! Wait! Wait! Hey, come on, wait a minute. Oh. I'm sorry. You okay? - I just hate rats, always have. - Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee. - If you make it an Irish one. - There's no alcohol allowed on the premises. - Yeah, don't remind me. (students laughing) (eerie music) - Where'd you come from? That's a great outfit. - Stay away from me. - Hey, it's cool, I won't hurt you. What's your name? - Please. (creature growls) - [Jack] How did you get in here? (mysterious music) - Please, stay away from me. - Hey it's okay, I work here. (rocks crashing) (creature howling) (woman gasps) (creature growling) - Feeling better? - Mm-hmm. Girlfriend? - (chuckles) No. It's from the meteor. - Oh, I thought it was a face. Feels like skin, like it's alive. - It's spooky. - I'm sorry about before, it's just, I was kinda scared. - Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't. - It's okay. I enjoyed it. - Well maybe, but- - But, nothing. Some things are just meant to be. - Are you always this persuasive? - I can do better. - [Ashley] You're doing just fine. (both laughing) (solemn music) (rain pattering) (creature growling) (woman crying) - I'll see you in class. - All right. (lips smacking) - Bye. - Bye. Hey. What about these? - I'll pick 'em up next time. (mysterious music) - No. It can't be her. (Ashley chuckles) (students shouting) - Hey! (students cheering and clapping) - They cheat. (women cheering) - You lucky son of a bitch. - Come on. Cheater. - Did not. - Can I have a word with you? - Sure. See ya later, Dan. - Yeah, see ya. - You're treading on thin ice. - What? - Come on, Ashley, I know what's going on. - I care for her a lot, I really do. - Stop it. Now. (students chattering) (water running) - Hey. - Louise! - What? - Is that a hickey? - It might be. - So art class is going all right? - It might be better. How's Dan? - He's okay, rough but ever-ready. (Louise laughs) - He just keeps- - [Both] Going and going and going. Going and going and going. (women laughing) - [Louise] You know, I got a crystal, same as everybody else. (women laughing) (water dripping) (creature growling) (mysterious music) (students chattering) - I knew it, I just knew it, $300. $300 and he just disappears, just gone. - Hey, he'll be back. He really cares about you. Hey listen, where's he gonna go? You know he lives on campus. - Son of a bitch, I'll kill him when I get my hands on him. - I take it you mean Jack? - How did you know? - Oh, I know, Miss Kendall, because Jack has worked here for a long time. In fact, too long. Far too long. - Hey hang on, I don't want him to lose his job. - Well, that I am happy to say, is not your decision. Good night, ladies. - Oh shit. This isn't fair, you know, he's gonna blame me. - Hey, at least he'll be back. (solemn music) (Louise breathing heavily) (thunder rumbling) (mysterious music) (creature howling) (Louise screams) - Jesus. You okay? (thunder rumbling) Stay here. (switch clicks) (mysterious music) (thunder rumbling) (creature growling) (door thuds) (woman grunts) It's okay, I'll be right back. (creature breathing heavily) (woman panting) - Shit. Ashley? - Hey! Hey, wait up, wait, hey! Hey, wait! Come on, wait! (tense music) Wait! Wait! (Ashley groans) Damn it. Wait! Wait! (tense music) (woman panting) (woman shouts) Come on! - Let me go! - Hold still! Hold still. That's better. Come on! - Let me go, please, let me go! - Come on, come on! Come on! Who are you, what are you doing here? - He'll kill you. - What the hell are you talking about? - I've tried to stop him, but he's too strong, let me go! - I don't understand. (woman shouting) (Ashley shouts) - Help me! Please! (woman shouting) Please! Help me! Please! - Ashley. Ashley, you all right? (solemn music) Oh my god, what happened? - I don't know. I don't know. - Come here, come here. (Ashley groans) (door banging) Okay, sit down. Better take your shirt off. (objects clattering) Shit. Okay, lift up your arm. (Ashley groans) I'm sorry. - Oh, shit. - You know, you're lucky. The wounds aren't deep, they're just ragged. God, whoever did this to you must be sick. - I told you what did this to me, and it's not human. - Okay, all right, well, at least we both saw the girl. - Okay, so where is she? - How the hell should I know? All I'm saying is what you're telling me, it just doesn't make any sense. - Easy. - I'm sorry. Here, hold still. (solemn music) (Ashley groans) (door banging) (Louise gasps) Jesus. Ms. Roper? Here, hold this. Let me help. Hey, let me help you. - What happened? The boogie man get you too? - Is that supposed to be a joke? Well? - My god, you saw it too, didn't you? Didn't you? - What are you talking about? - God, your head- - No. - No, wait, wait, wait! - That's it, I'm calling the police. - What are they gonna do? - Look, I don't know. You know, but if there's some alien monster down there, then who the hell else are we gonna call? (tense music) (people chattering) - You finish here. Then clear back to the station, Tom. I'll take a look around. - Right. Okay guys, let's finish up. Let's go. - I've got two people missing. Maybe three. All of them linked to you. Drink, drugs, seen it all before. But alien monsters. That's a new one. I don't like wasting my time. And I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. Believe me. - What the hell you doing? You saw it, why didn't you say something? - You're being a fool. - Are you all right? What's going on, Ash? I'm scared. Where's Myra? - I don't know. I just don't know. Come on. (chattering on police radio) (water falling) (solemn music) - [Woman] Help me. (woman shushing) What's happening to me? Please. (door opening) (creature growling) (mysterious music) (door creaking) (Louise sighs) - You know, I can't help worrying, Ash. It's not like Myra just to go off. - Maybe she and Jack eloped. - I thought you cared. You know what, forget it, I'll find her myself. - Wait a minute. I'm sorry, I do care. It's just everything's gotten so weird. Admit it, ever since that meteor landed, things have gone crazy. - You don't think something's happened to Myra, do you? - Yeah. I do, Jack's probably got her working as a stripper somewhere. (chuckling) (Louise laughs) I'm sorry, look, Jack's office is over here, why don't we go down there and take a look? Maybe we'll find something that can put your mind at rest. (switch clicks) Jack? God, half the wall's come down. - Yuck. What is it? - It's blood, I think. Come on, it leads off this way. Whew! Jeez, it stinks down here. - Ashley? God, what is this place? (Ashley gasps) (Ashley sighs) - God. Don't do that. - Sorry. - We're gonna need a flashlight and some ropes and... - Guns? Well, you said there's a fucking alien down here. - I never said there was an alien, I said there was a monster. - Well, excuse me, Mr. Picky. - All right, well, I got a flashlight and some stuff upstairs, we'll get it and we'll come back. - Okay. - Okay. It's weird down here. - Well, well. A Ghostbuster. How come I'm not surprised? Blood. But I guess you know that already. - We don't know what's going on here any more than you do. - Really? So why don't I believe you? - I don't care what you believe. Come on- - Oh no. Don't go. I'll get my forensic boys over here. To check out that tunnel. While we three go downtown and have a little chat. - Fine. - Okay, Tom. Have the forensic boys check out that cellar. You check out the tunnel. - Right. - Tom. Be careful. I don't know what we got into here. - You don't really believe he saw something, do you? - No. I don't. Be careful. - Okay guys, let's move. Let's go! (guns clicking) Hey Poole, move your ass! - Sorry, Sarge. - Yeah, well you will be. (ominous music) Okay, listen up. We'll work in pairs. Dividing off as we come to a fork in the tunnel. Poole, get back to the car. We check in every half hour, and Poole, stay awake. I'm damn sure these radios won't work the deeper we go in the tunnel, so I'm relying on you to relay messages back to the station, okay? - Sure Sarge, no problem. - Okay, people. Let's move out. (mysterious music) - [Poole] Hey, that's your ride? No? - [Woman] Cops. (mysterious music) - [Poole] Car 455, over. - [Mousy] Read you, 455, over. - [Poole] Yeah, Mousy, what's happening? - [Mousy] That you, Tim? - Yeah, just reporting in. Horace is in at the dragon's lair and has left me to guard his back. - [Mousy] You sound disappointed. - Not me, it's like some Lon Chaney movie down there. - [Mousy] Feast your eyes, close your soul on my cursed ugliness. - Fan of 1925, you a fan too? - Yeah. (Poole chuckles) - Taylor, Riley. (mysterious music) (footsteps echoing) - Oh, shit. (Riley chuckles) - [Riley] You should be more careful. (Riley chuckling) (Riley shouts) (Riley screaming) - Riley? (tense music) Riley? Riley? Sarge? (Taylor breathing heavily) Sarge? Anyone there? Can you hear me? - Taylor, that you? Taylor? Taylor? - Sarge? Sarge? (Taylor shouts) - What are you looking at? Keep your eyes peeled. Taylor, don't fuck with me. (static buzzing on radio) Damn you, Taylor, answer me! Riley, you there? Taylor, don't screw with me. Riley, you there? Taylor? (radio crunches) (creature growling) Fuckin' things are useless. Poole, Poole, do you read, over? Jeez. Poole! - Shit. - Sarge, that you, Sarge? - [Sarge] Of course it's me, you fool. - You're breaking up, Sarge. - Yeah, no shit. Now listen up. I've lost contact with Taylor and Riley. Their radios must be down. Let headquarters know, we'll keep looking for about an hour and then pull out, over. - [Poole] Roger, Sarge, consider it done. - There's a lot of iron ore embedded in these rocks. Deeper you go, more it fucks up the radios. - Tell me about it. Taylor's smart, he'll turn back first sign of trouble. - Maybe the aliens got him. - Can it, Tolben. You okay? Okay, let's move out. - You think I'm stupid, professor, is that it?! (phone ringing) If we find a body down there, you're in deep shit, you know that? - I haven't done anything. I looked out the window, I saw the girl, I followed her, and some thing attacked us, okay? - You're fucking the blonde, professor. - Screw you. I want a lawyer. - My guess is you're gonna need one. Asshole. (phone ringing) - Just heard from Horace. Lost radio contact with Taylor. Those tunnels are bigger than we thought. - Hell of a place to hide a body. - Yeah, but why? If he killed him, why'd he do it? - How the fuck should I know? The guy's a wacko! Get out of here. - [Woman] Watch it. - Right. Staines, Talbot, Grey, take the left fork. Styles, you come with me. - Where do you suppose that water's coming from, Sarge? - Sea, sewers, hard to tell. Figure we what, walked maybe about a mile? Cliff edge can't be much further. - All this oil. The refinery's leaking. - So write The Globe. Okay, let's move out. And stay in touch on your radios while they last. Let's go. (ominous music) - Think the Sarge is gonna get us outta here? - If he doesn't, I do. - Hey, there's a light up ahead. Hey, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. (tense music) (water falling) (mysterious music) - Sarge. I think we found something. - So I can see. Stay close. (footsteps thudding) Okay, easy. Okay, Miss. Wanna come out and let's have a look at you? (woman laughing) I said... (mysterious music) Jesus Christ. (tense music) (creature snarls) - Shit, Sarge. (creature roaring) (gunshots banging) - Shit! - What the fuck was that? - How the fuck should I know? Styles? Styles? - Ah, shit. I shot her. Christ, I shot her! - Shut up. - I didn't mean to! She just got in the way. - She's hurt bad. We gotta get her out. Quick, help me get her onto her feet. (tense music) (creature snarling) - You know, you should be out there looking for Myra and not wasting your time with me and Ashley. - Okay, you can go. - What? - You're wasting my time. - And what about Ashley? - Just get out. And mind the boogie man don't get you. - Ah, shit. Shit, we're lost. Fucking lost. Let's leave her. She's slowing us down. - She's coming with us. - She's fucking dead! - No she ain't! Bastards have enough of my men. If we get out, so does she. (gun clicks) Now help me carry her. Okay, let's try this way. (Talbot shouting) (creature roaring) Fucking hell. (gun clicks) Freeze. I'll blow your fucking head off. - I can help you. - No way. (Talbot screaming) - Hurry. Hurry, please, I can get you out. - Fucking hell. (suspenseful music) (creature growling) (gunshots banging) (creature roaring) (gun clicks) (banging on wall) (creature roaring) (Sarge coughing) - Styles. Styles! No! - Look at me! She's dead, just leave her. (creature roaring) (Sarge grunting) (suspenseful music) (gun clicking) - Shit. - Come on, we can't stop. - Come here. Get my breath back. Why? Why are you helping me? - Why shouldn't I? I'm just as human as you are. - What the hell happened to you? How'd you get these scars? What are you doing here, where'd you come from? - I was abducted. (Sarge chuckles) - Strange blue lights and alien experiments. - They're not experimenting anymore. I gotta go. I gotta go. (creature snarling) (gunshots banging) (Sarge shouts) (creature growling) (gas hissing) - Happy trails, motherfucker. (explosion booming) (glass shattering) (fire alarm ringing) (Poole groaning) (ominous music) (fire crackling) (creature roaring) (fire alarm ringing) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (Ms. Roper gasps) - What the hell is happening? - I don't know, some kind of explosion. Who are you? - I'm the principal. Okay, that's far enough. Okay, let's go back to your rooms, the fun is- - Are these girls on drugs or what? - Are you deaf? I said... What the hell is going on? - These girls can't hear you. They're sleepwalking. - We better follow them. (tense music) (liquid splatters) (woman crying) (woman screaming) - I can't go down there. - We can't just leave them. - I can. - Oh, you coward, what is it... (Ms. Roper screams) (Poole grunts) (creature snarling) (Ms. Roper grunts and falls) (phone ringing) - Anything you forget, you can pick up next time. - Why don't you give me a break, Moore? I told you the truth. Where's Louise? - She left. Hours ago. - What do you mean, left? She back at the college? - Nice try, I almost believed you. - If anything happens to her, Moore. - Go home. - Asshole. (siren wailing) (ominous music) (switch clicks) (door crashes) (Ashley shouts) Whoa! (eerie music) Louise? Louise? Louise? Louise? My god. (Louise growling) Louise? Louise?! (Ashley shouting) (both grunting) (Louise snarling) (Ashley grunting) (Louise growling) (Ashley grunts) (board thuds) (woman grunts) (Louise snarling) - The crystal! Get the crystal. (woman grunts) (woman panting) (Louise gasping) (suspenseful music) - It's okay. - Shit. Oh! (eerie music) Oh god. Oh god. (Ms. Roper gasping) (woman roars) - I think you should have a drink. - You're crazy. - What am I supposed to do? - Let's just leave, please. It's her, isn't it? It's the girl. - We owe her. You owe her. - For what? - She saved our lives. If it wasn't for her, we'd both be dead. I'm not leaving her to the mercy of that thing. What are you doing? - I'm coming with you. - No, I don't think so. - I don't care what you think. I'm going. - Women. (phone ringing) - Moore. What? - I said all the students are gone and I just killed another fucking alien. Now either I'm telling the truth or I'm some raving lunatic on a blood spree, but either way, Moore, you better get your ass over here. That oughta get his attention. - Asshole. (phone bangs) (solemn music) (Ashley coughs) - [Louise] Hey, wait a second. - What the hell you doing? Hey. What are you... (glass shattering) - [Louise] Here, take this. - Whoa. What do we do with all this stuff? (gun clicks) - I'll be fucked if I'm going down there unarmed. - [Ashley] Wait. (Ashley mumbling) - Jesus. What the hell happened? - I don't know. Watch your step. - Do you think the tunnel will still be open? - Let's take a look. - Yuck. I think it's more blood. - Oh god. I think you're right. Come on. - God, this really isn't safe. (creature growling) (cocoon breaking) (mysterious music) (women growling) (web breaking) (liquid splashing) (tense music) (women growling) (objects clattering) (solemn music) (gun clicking) (creature screaming) - I guess we're getting close. (tense music) - What is it? - I don't know, I thought I saw... Nevermind. I should have never have let you come down here. - It's too late now. Come on, let's go. (women growling) - Shit. - Ashley? (women growling) Ashley?! (woman screeching) (gunshots banging) (guns clicking) (women snarling) It's more of that slime. - I think he's using these things to control his victims. - You know, most of the girls in the college are wearing those. - I know. - Oh my god. Who did we just kill? - They were dead already. Let's get the hell outta here before their friends come back. Come on. (clicking tongue) (gun clicking) (mysterious music) (both gasping) Shit, it's one of the cops. - I don't think we're gonna find anyone alive down here. - There's still the girl. - How could I forget? (tense music) (creature growling) (mysterious music) (Ms. Roper muttering) (creature growling) (footsteps thudding) (creature growling) (suspenseful music) (Ms. Roper shouts) (guns clicking) (Ms. Roper gasps) - Jesus, Roper. - [Ms. Roper] Oh my god. My god. - [Louise] Come sit down. - What are you doing down here? - It's like being in hell. The girls, I don't know, they're mesmerized. - Yeah, we think he's using the crystals to call them and control them. - So then how come I wasn't called? - Well, you weren't here, thank God. You know, I think I could kiss that detective. - You save your kisses. Ashley! (woman growling) (Ms. Roper screaming) (board thuds) (woman screaming) (woman snarling) (board thuds) Are you all right? Ashley, I'm so scared! - God. (both panting) (fingernails scraping) (eerie music) - Where are you, Tom? (women growling) (Ms. Roper screaming) (fabric ripping) (water falling) - How deep do you think it is? - It's deep. (creature growling) - We're trapped. - Maybe. Maybe not. (Ashley grunts) - Ashley? No way. - We don't have a choice. We're completely lost with the army of mutants on our tail. - But just look at it, it's not safe. - Think you're any safer up here? Don't tell me you'd rather be eaten by aliens. (women growling) - You got a point. (Louise shouts) (water splashing) (suspenseful music) (Louise gasping and coughing) - Hold onto me! - Ashley! - The current's too strong. - Ashley! (Louise shouts) (Louise coughing) Ashley! (both shout) (water bubbling) (water falling) (both shouting) (water splashing) (Ashley panting) - Louise. (creature growling) (Ashley gasping) - Shh, shh. He won't kill her. You know what he does. (creature growling) Please, your bullets can't hurt him. What are you doing? I warned you! - We came to get you. - You can't help me! - Yes we can, we're gonna get out of here, all of us. - You don't understand, I breathe when he says breathe and I stop when I'm told. He uses me, he controls me. - For what? - To carry his eggs. - You're pregnant? Look at me. Look at me! Are you pregnant? - [Woman] No. - Are you? - [Woman] No. - You're sure? - I'm not pregnant, I'm just carrying his eggs. When these things give birth, they kill and feed off each other. Especially the parents, that's why the whole species is dying. - Well, that's good. What's he gonna do with the college girls? - Incubate the eggs, he needs new hosts for the birth, one for each egg. And then tear each other apart. - And what's he gonna do with Louise? - What he did with me. - Okay. (creature growling) (water falling) (mysterious music) (Louise coughing) - Ashley? (creature growling) Ashley? Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! - Oh, great. Oh thank God, they're all dry. If these bullets won't hurt him, I'm damn sure these crystals will. Just keep watch. Come here, help me, fill one of these with this. To the top. (creature growling) (suspenseful music) (Louise whimpering) (Louise shouting) (creature roaring) Move it! (gunshot bangs) (creature howling) (bullet shell clattering) (gunshot bangs) (creature howling) (Louise panting) - Ashley. Ashley. - It's okay, I'm here. Cut her loose. - Get it off me. (creature roars) (gunshot bangs) Ashley? Get it off me. Hurry! (creature roars) (suspenseful music) No! (Ashley groaning) (gunshot bangs) (creature roars) (gun clicks) (gunshot blasts) (gun clicks) - Shit. - Hurry! Please hurry! He's getting up! Ashley, wake up! Hurry. (Louise screams) He'll hypnotize you! Don't look at his eyes! (Louise whimpering) (creature snarling) Don't look at him. Please, don't look at him! - No, you won't control me anymore! - Ashley! (gunshots banging) (creature howling) (water splashing) - Now do you believe me? (tense music) (creature howling) We gotta get outta here. Come on! - Follow me. - Come on, run! Come on! (explosions booming) (Louise screams) (rubble crashing) (woman growling) (gunshot bangs) (Louise screams) (explosions booming) (Louise panting) - It's over. - Is it? What happens to me? Where will I go? What do I do? - I don't know. But we'll be there for ya. Won't we? - You can bet on it. (gulls cawing) (explosion booming) - Make a wish. (suspenseful music) (MultiCom Jingle)
