[♪♪♪] [BOY SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] BOY: Ha! Ha! [SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [YELLING INDISTINCTLY] Come, come! Please! Please! Please! [WHISPERING] Aziz. Aziz. Aziz, light! Aziz, light. Good. We start again. "When the three planets are in eclipse, the black hole, like a door, is opened. Evil comes... ...spreading terror and chaos." See the snake, Billy? The ultimate evil. - Make sure you get the snake. - Yes, I've got your snakes. I got all the snakes. So when is this snake act supposed to occur? Huh? Well, if this is the five... ...and this is the one... [WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] Every 5000 years. So I've got some time, then. [SNORING] [GASPS] Ah, you bring them water. Good boy. I will take it to them. Go with God. Be safe from evil. PACOLI: You see here these different peoples, or symbols of people... ...gathering together the four elements of life: water, fire, earth, air... ...around a fifth one. A fifth... ...element. Forgive me, lord. They already know too much. [GLASS CLINKS] Ah, Father. - Yes, how are you today? - Well, Billy. You have some glasses? - Of course. - Father, I'm so glad to see you. It's the most extraordinary thing. I mean, look, it's the greatest find in history. Yes. You must be parched. Oh, yes, yes. I'm sorry. It's like a battle plan. Here, the good. Here, the evil. And here, a weapon against evil. I'm going to be famous. Then... Then let us... Let us toast to your fame. Oh, yes. To fame. Salute. You can't drink a toast with water. Billy, in my sack, the grappa. Yes. [MEN YELLING NEARBY] [♪♪♪] [GROANS] This I don't understand. But this... This could be something... ...prehistoric. Maybe. I don't know. But wait. Here. [CHILDREN LAUGHING NEARBY] BOY: Look, look. They're here. PACOLI: This man... ...this perfect being. I know this is the key. I know it. This divine light they talk about. What is divine light? Aziz, light! Much better. Thank you, Aziz. My lord. [MOUTHING] [GROWLING] Father, this is the most unbelievable thing I have ever seen. Don't you think...? Ah... Ah... Ah... Are you German? Lord, I know he was about to discover everything. But there is no worry. I was there in time. MONDOSHAWAN: Priest, you and those before you... ...have served us well. But war is coming. Stones not safe on Earth anymore. This... ...is really amazing. [GROWLING AND SNORTING] The fifth element. Take the stones. My lord... ...if you take the weapon, we will be defenseless when evil returns. In 300 years, when evil returns... ...so shall we. Oh, professor. Professor. [STAMMERING] Don't move! - I have a gun! PRIEST: Billy. Please, understand. They are our friends. Friends? Father, they've killed the professor! They're monsters! I'll explain everything. Billy. - You're with them? PRIEST: Billy, look at me. Look at me. I am your friend. - No, Father. - Billy, look at me! Please, put the gun down. No. Billy, no! [MONDOSHAWAN GROANS] [RUMBLING] Hurry! The wall is closing! MONDOSHAWAN: Here is your mission now: Pass your knowledge to the next priest as it was passed on to you. I will do as you command, but please, hurry, you still have time. MONDOSHAWAN: Time not important. Only life important. I will fulfill my mission! You can count on me! I will pass the knowledge until your return. [CHATTERING] - Anything yet? - No, sir. - Not even a temperature? - The thermo-analyzers have jammed. One of them shows a million degrees, the others minus 5000. Let's see it. It's taking shape. Send out a probe. MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the Federated Territories. On air with General Staedert in 30 seconds. Oh, I saved this seat for you, Father. - President on the line, sir. - We're in position, Mr. President. I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, general. There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as yet. All the calibers are overshot. We're initiating a thermonucleatic imaging. So, what you're saying is, you don't know what this is. Not yet, sir. All we know is, it just keeps getting bigger. Recommendation? My philosophy, Mr. President, is shoot first and ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests. - All right, then, Staedert... CORNELIUS: Mr. President? Yes? COMPUTER: Priest Vito Cornelius, expert of astrophenomenon. I have a different theory to offer you, sir. You have 20 seconds. [♪♪♪] Imagine for a moment that this... ...thing is not anything that can be identified... ...because it prefers not to be. Wherever there is life, it brings death... - ...because it is evil. Absolute evil. - One more reason to shoot first. Evil begets evil, Mr. President. Shooting will only make it stronger. [PROBE BEEPING] Probe will obtain its objective in five seconds. Growth rate is at 27 percent. Your theory is interesting, but we don't have time to go into that now. Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important. You're right. That's exactly what we're gonna do. We're gonna protect the life of some 200 billion of my fellow citizens. General, you may fire when ready. Up-front loading of a 120-ZR missile. Marker lights on the objective. Its structure has just solidified on the surface. I think it's anticipating the attack. Anticipation denotes intelligence. The most terrible intelligence imaginable, Mr. President. 120's loaded. The ship is in combat formation. Missiles are loaded, Mr. President. - Staedert. STAEDERT: Yes, sir. - I have a doubt. - I don't, Mr. President. Staedert? What happened? Staedert, can you hear me? Staedert? What happened, Staedert? - Did you destroy it? -I'm about to, sir. The planet has increased in diameter by 200 percent. It's moving towards the ship. What...? What do we have that's bigger than 240? Nothing, sir. Staedert, do you hear me? Get out of there. I don't want an incident. Do you hear me, Staedert? Get out of there. Can you hear me, Staedert? Do you understand? Listen. This is the president. That's an order. Do you understand me? Do you hear me? [BREAKING UP ON RADIO] Get out of there! Answer me! Good God! [GROANING] [♪♪♪] COMPUTER: Four a day. [MEOWING] I'm trying. COMPUTER: To quit is my goal. [PHONE RINGING] Hey, hey, hey. I'm up. All right, I'm up. God. Yeah. Yeah. Yes? MAN [ON PHONE]: Hey, dog brain, Finger here. - Hi, sweetie. - I love you too, major... ...but you haven't called me that since basic training. - I was talking to the cat. - Oh, yeah, I forgot... ...you still prefer your cat to the real thing. KORBEN: At least the cat comes back. You still pining for that two-timing slut? There are a million women out there. I don't want a million women. I just want one. The perfect one. - It don't exist, major. - Yeah, I know. Ugh. - What? -I just found a picture of you. - Oh, how do I look? -Like shit. Must be an old picture. Listen, you gotta bring me your hack for a six-month overhaul. - Negative. - ASAP. I don't need one. Hey, you forgetting who sat next to you for 1000 missions? I know how you drive. Finger, I drive a cab now, not a space fighter. Okay, so tell me. How many points you got left on your license? Major, how many points? At least 50. Know what? You gotta learn how to lie better. See you tonight. FEMALE VOICE: Welcome to paradise. MAN [ON TV]: Welcome to Fhloston Paradise. It's Ruby Rhod, your main man, and I will tell you live at 5... ...the name of the winner of the super-green Gemini Croquette Contest! The winner will go with me for two days to Fhloston Paradise. So tune in to Radio Cosmos. Don't watch it all day, sweetie. It'll rot your brain. For a perfect world. - Give me the cash. - Been here long? Yeah, long enough. Come on, give me the cash. Is that a Z-140? Alleviated titanium. - Neurocharged assault model. - Yeah. Yeah. Good thing for me it's not loaded. [LAUGHING] - What do you mean, it's not loaded? - Well, you have to... You have to push that little yellow button to load it. [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] Take your time. Oh, God. You want me to...? Okay. [GUN COCKS] There you go. Give me the cash! [GUN WHIRS] [♪♪♪] That's a very dangerous gun. You know, maybe you better let me hang on to this one for you, huh? - You don't mind, do you? MAN: No. - You sure? - No. Take it. I don't need it. [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] That's a very nice hat. You like it? God! COMPUTER: Please enter your license. Yes, yes, just a minute. COMPUTER: Welcome on board, Mr. Dallas. Good morning. Sleep well? Yeah, me too. - I had a horrible nightmare. - Propulsion 2X4. You have five points left on your license. Yeah, thank you for reminding me. Have a nice day. Why not? [CAR HORNS HONKING] You have 48 hours. That's the length of time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions. - And then? - And then it will be too late. The goal of this thing is not to fight over money or power... ...but to exterminate life. All forms of life. So what you're telling me, Father, there's nothing that can stop this. There is only one thing. CORNELIUS: The Mondoshawan have the only weapon to defeat evil. Four elements... ...gathered around a fifth... ...supreme being, the ultimate warrior, created to protect life. Together they produce what the ancients called the Light of Creation. Able to bring life to the farthest reaches of the universe. But if evil stands there... Then what? Then light turns to dark. Life to death... ...forever. Sir, there's a Mondoshawan spaceship at the frontier... ...requesting permission to enter our territory. PRESIDENT: Give it permission to enter our territory with our warmest regards. Thank you. MAN: Permission to enter granted. [♪♪♪] Showtime. [COMPUTER BEEPING] We are lost. MANGALORE: Aknot, we are connected to Earth. [GROWLS] Mr. Zorg's office. AKNOT [ON INTERCOM]: It's Aknot. ZORG: I'm so glad to hear you, Aknot. AKNOT [ON INTERCOM]: The mission is accomplished. You'll have what you asked for in a few hours. ZORG: Good. I'll meet you at my factory. The attack was launched by two unregistered warships. Close all borders and declare a state of general alert. Yes, sir. Try to make contact with the Mondoshawans. - We owe them an explanation. - Sir. Three hundred years of waiting, for nothing. Father, you should go home now and rest. No. The Mondoshawan... I am their contact on Earth. They will come for me. Father, this is government business now. I will keep you informed. [♪♪♪] The rescue team has reported from the Mondoshawan crash site. Any survivors? Only one. MUNRO: That what you call a survivor? A few cells are still alive. It's more than I need. - Have you identified it? MACTILBURGH: We tried... ...but the computer went off the charts. You see, normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groups... ...which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself. This has 200,000 memo groups. - Sounds like a freak of nature to me. - Yeah, can't wait to meet him. You okay, general? Over here. Excuse me. Okay, general, I want to show you something here. This is a normal human DNA chain, okay? You, me, anybody, right? Watch this. The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours. There's more of them, tightly packed, with infinite genetic knowledge. Almost like this being was engineered. - Is there any danger? - No, no, no. We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is, for lack of a better word... ...perfect. Okay, go ahead. But Mr. Perfect better be polite. Otherwise, I turn him into cat food. Activate it. [♪♪♪] Tissue processing. Ten seconds to ultraviolet protection. MACTILBURGH: This is the last phase. The cells are bombarded by greasy solar atoms... ...which forces the body to react to protect itself. That means growing skin. Wonderful. Reconstruction complete. Remove the shield. I told you. Perfect. Thermal bandages. I'd, um, like to take a few pictures... ...for the archives. [GASPS] [GRUNTING] [GROWLS] [PANTING] [SPEAKING IN DIVINE LANGUAGE] - What's she saying? - I don't know. Activate the phonic detector. Is, uh...? Is that thing solid? - Unbreakable. - Good. If you want out... ...you're going to have to learn to develop those communication skills. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GROWLING] General alert. Perfect. [ALARM BUZZING] [♪♪♪] Ladder on 18. Two men with me. The rest in the main ventilation. Okay, sir. This way. OFFICER 1: Okay, lady, stay calm. This is the police. There's nowhere else to go. So you're gonna slowly turn around and put your hands on the floor. Do you understand me? She doesn't. I think we need a flying unit here. OFFICER 2 [ON LOUDSPEAKER]: This is the police. This is the police. We are processing your identification. Please put your arms up and follow our instructions. She has no file. She dove off. [KORBEN YELLS] COMPUTER: You just had an accident. Yes, I know I just had an accident, you daffy bastard! - You have one point left on your license. COMPUTER: You have one point... Look out! No, no! Left! I can't believe it. Shit. Any survivors? [♪♪♪] Hi. Are you okay? [SPEAKING IN DIVINE LANGUAGE] Boom. Boom. Yeah, I understand "boom." Bada boom. Big. Big bada boom. Big... Bada big boom. - Big boom. - Yeah. - Yeah, big bada boom. - Bada boom. Big boom. Big bada boom. You're lucky you're not dead. [SIREN BLARES] OFFICER [ON LOUDSPEAKER]: This is a police control. Please keep your hands on the wheel. You have an unauthorized passenger in your vehicle. We are going to arrest her. Thank you for your cooperation. Sorry, honey. Looks like this is your ride. Open the door. - Akta. - Better do what they say. [SPEAKS IN DIVINE LANGUAGE] Sorry. [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] "Please... ...help." I've only got one point left on my license... ...and I need that to get back to the garage and get the cab a six-month overhaul. You understand? Can you please open the passenger door? Ple... Please... ...help. I can't. OFFICER [ON LOUDSPEAKER]: I repeat... ...can you please open your passenger door? Yeah, yeah, sure. Why not? Thank you for your cooperation. Help. Finger's gonna kill me. Emergency! Emergency! COMPUTER: One point has been removed from your license. Yes, I know! ...on your license. This is so stupid. WOMAN [ON RADIO]: All units assist in pursuit of yellow cab, Level 10. Unit 47, we're on the way... ...as soon as we finish lunch. Two golden menus. OFFICER 1: Thank you. OFFICER 2: I'm too old, too tired... ...and too hungry to go chasing some hot rod. Thank you so much. And I'm definitely too thirsty. KORBEN: Look out! Whoa. We got lucky. If they don't chase you after a mile, they don't chase you. [♪♪♪] [SIRENS BLARING] Maybe it's two miles. Hang on. [YELLING IN DIVINE LANGUAGE] Look, lady, I only speak two languages: English and bad English! Run an ID. Don't get me wrong, I'm for conversation, but maybe you could shut up for a minute! I get nothing. He's got a scan blocker. Means he's a car thief. Blast him. I don't know what you did to piss these guys off... ...but they are really pissed off! Hold on! I think we're safe for a while. You want to play it soft? We'll play it soft. You want to play it hard? Let's play it hard. [SPEAKING IN DIVINE LANGUAGE] We make it to the fog, we'll be all right. If we make the fog. How do they expect us to find anything in this shit? We're just gonna wait here for a little while until things quiet down, if you don't mind. Hey. Shit. You okay? Priest. You don't need a priest, you just need a doctor. You'll be all right. Vito Cornelius. What? Priest. Yes? I'm, uh, looking for a priest. Weddings are one floor down, my son. Congratulations. She's not my bride. She's my fare. She's looking for a priest named Vito Cornelius. The phone book said he lived here. Yes, that's me, but I don't know who she is. Nobody knows who she is. No file, no ID, nothing. She's got a tattoo on this arm here. Tattoo? [♪♪♪] [STAMMERS] Fifth... ...element. Finger's gonna kill me. - Hey! Wake up! - Who are you? I brought the girl, remember? The redhead. She just dropped in on me. Started speaking this bizarre language. It's not bizarre. It's the divine language. - The ancient language... - Okay. ...spoken throughout the universe before time was time. He... He's a she. You noticed that, huh? Yes. - It's a miracle. - Miracle she's not dead. We've not a moment to lose. Wake her up. But gently, because this woman is mankind's most precious possession. She is perfect. [♪♪♪] Perfect. More dignified. Hey, lady... ...wake up. [GUN COCKS] You're right, I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have done that. It was wrong to kiss you. He said to wake you gently. You're right. You're right. [SPEAKING IN DIVINE LANGUAGE] Just thought you might remember me from the cab. Remember? "Bada boom"? - "Big bada boom"? - Boom? Boom. Big bada boom. In the cab. Here, look. I drive a cab. This is me. Korben Dallas. Korben. You understand? Here. Take it, go ahead. You can call me when you learn how to speak English. Oop. Ah. Just kidding. Kidding. And you... What is your name? You. Korben. Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat. Good. That's... That whole thing's your name, huh? Do you have... ...a shorter name? Not "yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh." Short. [WHISPERS] Korben Dallas. Leeloo. [♪♪♪] Leeloo. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Korben, Leeloo. Leeloo, Korben. [PANTING] [LAUGHING] Father, are you sure she's a supreme being? Absolutely sure. Old friends. Okay. Yeah, you're right. Listen, do you think you could ask her if I could have the gun back, please? - What's your name? - Korben Dallas. Thank you, Mr. Dallas, for all your help. Thank you so much. You've been so kind, but now the girl needs rest... ...because she's been on a long trip. Yes, I know. I was there when she landed. Wait, wait, hey. Wait, wait, Father. She said something I didn't understand. Well, I didn't understand any of it... - ...but what does "ekto gamat" mean? - "Never without my permission." That's what I thought. I shouldn't have kissed her. [CAT MEOWING] Oh, no. I'm so sorry. I forgot your food. [PHONE RINGING] How about some nice Thai food to apologize, huh? Yeah, yeah, hold on. What? FINGER [ON PHONE]: Hey, buddy, I'm waiting all day here. - Finger. - Where is the cab? Car's running fine. Purring like a kitten. "Fine. "What "fine"? I know you, Dallas. "Fine" ain't in your vocabulary. Come on, you can tell your old buddy Finger what happened. - What? You save the planet? -Listen. You dinged the fender again. Right? You dinged the goddamn fender. Finger, I was on my way over to see you and a big fare fell in my lap. You know, one of these really big fares that you just can't resist. Oh. How big? [♪♪♪] [MOANS] Five-nine... ...blue eyes... ...long legs, great skin. You know. Perfect. Uh-huh. I see. And this perfect fare, she got a name? Yeah. Leeloo. What's she doing? Learning our history, the last 5000 years that she's missed. Been asleep for quite a while, you know. [IMITATING MARTIAL ARTS YELL] Father, I know she's been through a lot, but we don't have much time. Yes, you're right. Chicken. Good. Chicken. I'm really sorry to interrupt you... ...but the case... ...with the stones... ...where is it? [SPEAKING IN DIVINE LANGUAGE] Stolen? Who in God's name would do such a thing? [♪♪♪] Excuse me, sir. The council is worried about the economy heating up. They wondered if it'd be possible to fire 500,000. Maybe from one of the smaller companies where no one would notice... ...like one of the cab companies. ZORG: Fire one million. But 500,000... One million. Fine, sir. Sorry to have disturbed you. [FOOTSTEPS WALKING] [FOOTSTEPS RUNNING] Oh, it's, uh... - It's for the Supreme... - Yes, yes, yes. Oh, sorry. I didn't know your size, and I found you this makeup box, okay? - You just put it like that. - Thank you. Yes, there was a man with a limp... ...came here about a month ago asking questions about the stones. He said he was an art dealer. [SPEAKING IN DIVINE LANGUAGE] What was his name? I'm so bad with names. - They really make her... - Perfect, I know. [SPEAKING IN DIVINE LANGUAGE] What did she say? CORNELIUS: She says she knows exactly where they are. My dear Aknot, how about those two little planes that you borrowed? Aknot, is that you? What an ugly face. It doesn't suit you. Take it off. That's better. Never be ashamed of who you are. You're warriors. Be proud. So what if the federal government scattered your people to the wind. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Your time for revenge is at hand. Voilà. The ZF-1. [MANGALORES GRUNTING] It's light. Handle's adjustable for easy carrying. Good for righties and lefties. Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by x-ray. Ideal for quick, discreet interventions. A word on firepower: Titanium recharger, 3000-round clip with bursts of 3 to 300. With the replay button, another Zorg invention, it's even easier. One shot... ...and replay sends every following shot to the same location. [MANGALORES YELLING] And to finish the job, all the Zorg oldies but goldies. Rocket launcher. Arrow launcher with exploding or poisonous gas heads. Very practical. Our famous net launcher. The always-efficient flamethrower. My favorite. And for the grand finale, the all-new ice-cube system. [MANGALORES APPLAUDING AND GRUNTING] Four full crates delivered right on time. And what about you, my dear Aknot? Did you bring me what I asked you for? Yes. Magnificent. This... This case is empty. [LAUGHING] - What do you mean, empty? - Empty... ...the opposite of full. This case is supposed to be full! Anyone care to explain? [SPEAKING IN DIVINE LANGUAGE] The Guardians gave the stones to someone they could trust. Who took another route. She's supposed to contact this person... ...in a hotel. And she's looking for the address. Easy. Dot. It's Planet Fhloston, in the Angel Constellation. - We're saved. - I'm screwed. You asked for a case. We brought you a case. A case with four stones in it! Not one or two or three, but four! Four stones! What the hell am I supposed to do with an empty case? We are warriors, not merchants. But you can still count! Look, it's easy. Look at my fingers. Four stones, four crates. Zero stones, zero crates! Pack everything up! We're out of here! [ROARS] [GUNS COCKING] AKNOT: We risked our lives. I believe a little compensation is in order. Oh. So you are merchants after all. Leave him one crate for the cause. I don't like warriors. Too narrow-minded, no subtlety... ...and worse, they fight for hopeless causes, honor. Honor's killed millions of people. Hasn't saved a single one. I'll tell you what I do like, though: a killer. A dyed-in-the-wool killer, cold-blooded, clean, methodical and thorough. Now, a real killer, when he picked up the ZF-1... ...would've immediately asked about the red button on the bottom of the gun. [♪♪♪] Bring me the priest. I got everything here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise... ...and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel. Good work, my son. Now all we've got to do is find a way of getting there. It's not gonna be easy. There's a charity ball on Fhloston tomorrow. Flights are full, and with the celebrities, the hotel will be guarded like a fortress. But there must be a way of getting there. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] No. I'll get it. Weddings? Not really. - Mr. Zorg would like to talk to you. - Mister who? Mr. Zorg. ZORG: Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg. It's nice to see you again, Father. Ah, I remember you now. The so-called art dealer. I'm glad you got your memory back, because you're gonna need it. Where are the stones? I don't know. And even if I did know, I wouldn't tell somebody like you. Why? - What's wrong with me? - I try to serve life. But you only... ...seem to want to destroy it. Ah, Father... ...you're so wrong. Let me explain. Life, which you so nobly serve... ...comes from destruction, disorder and chaos. Now, take this empty glass. Here it is, peaceful, serene, boring. But if it is... ...destroyed... Look at all these little things. So busy now. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet ensues, so full of form and color. Now, think about all those people that created them. Technicians, engineers. Hundreds of people who will be able to feed their children tonight... ...so those children can grow big and strong and have children of their own... ...and so on and so forth. Thus adding to the great chain... ...of life. FEMALE VOICE: Water. Fruit. You see, Father, by creating a little destruction... FEMALE VOICE: A cherry. ...I'm, in fact, encouraging life. In reality, you and I are in the same business. Cheers. [♪♪♪] [CHOKING] Where's the robot to pat you on the back? Or the engineer? [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING] Or their children, maybe? You see now how all your so-called power counts for absolutely nothing? How your entire empire of destruction comes crashing down... ...all because of one, little cherry. You saved my life... ...and in return, I'll spare yours... ...for now. You're a monster, Zorg. I know. Torture who you have to, the president, I don't care. Just bring me those stones. You have one hour. [♪♪♪] [SATELLITES BEEPING] It's gobbling up all the communications satellites in the galaxy. Why in the hell is it eating up all the satellites? We're working on it, Mr. President. I've contacted the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident... ...but they accept our apologies. And the stones? Did you find them in the wreckage? - The stones weren't aboard the ship. - What do you mean? The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the human race. They gave the stones to someone they do trust. Her name is Plavalaguna. She's a diva. And she's going to sing at a charity ball in Fhloston Paradise in a few hours. She has the stones with her. The Mondoshawans have accepted an offer to help. All we have to do is send someone to get the stones and bring them back to her. Excellent. [SCREAMS] I want this operation to be discreet as possible. No troops. No big operation. I want your best man to go undercover. I have the perfect one. - You got a message. - Yeah. Not gonna open it? Could be important. Yeah. Like the last two I got were important. First one was from my wife telling me she's leaving. The second one was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving with my wife. That is bad luck. But grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news, guaranteed. I bet your lunch. Okay. Come on. You are fired. Oh, I'm sorry. KORBEN: Well... [PHONE RINGING] At least I won lunch. Good philosophy. See good in bad. I like. - Hello. WOMAN: Korben, sweetheart. You got broken fingers? You can't punch my number? - Hi, Mom. - Seventeen messages. Don't tell me your machine is broken. Those things are good for 1000 years. Mr. Kim, you should go. This is gonna take a minute. You wouldn't even feed your pussycat, who you obviously love more than me. - But she didn't breast-feed you. I did. - Goodbye, Mr. Dallas. Ah, fortune for you. ...Up on me. Oh, Christ, I'll never be a grandmother. MR. KIM: It bring you good luck! - Yeah, sure. [MR. KIM SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] You know my poor body's failing me. You have to take me on this trip. Ma, what are you talking about? I get it. You want to make your only mother beg. Is that it? No, I don't want to make you beg. All I want is an explanation. I just got in. I just smashed my cab. I lost my job. I got mugged. Besides that, everything's peachy. Thanks for asking. Now, will you just settle down and explain this to me calmly. Oh, so you don't know you won a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two for 10 days. I suppose you're just gonna leave me on the lunar surface to freeze my ass off. If I'd have won a trip, I'd know about it. Somebody would've notified me. Korben, they've been blaring your name out on the radio for the last hour. [DOOR BUZZES] Ma, I'll call you back. General Munro, how nice to see you in the 5000 block. Nice apartment, major. Looks like you settled into a wonderful life. Heard you lost your job. You heard that, huh? Well, don't worry. I'll get another job. Don't bother. We have one for you. "Major Dallas, you've been selected for a mission of the utmost importance." - What mission? - To save the world. "You leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four stones from the diva Plavalaguna and bring them back." - Any questions? - Yeah, just one. Why me? I retired six months ago, you remember? Three reasons. One, as a member of the Elite Special Forces Unit of the federated army... ...you are an expert in the use of weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission. Two, of all the members of your unit, you're the most highly decorated. - And the third one? - Of all the members of your unit... ...you're the only one left alive. You check your messages? No, I've had enough good news for one day. Might be important. RECORDED VOICE: You're a winner! You've won the annual Gemini Contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two. Here are your tickets. - You rigged the contest? - Uh-huh. Congratulations. You couldn't think of anything a little more discreet, huh? Old tricks are the best tricks, eh? Major Iceborg will accompany you as your wife. I am not going. Why not? [♪♪♪] [DOOR BUZZES] Excuse me, general. Who is it? Who is it? - My wife. - You remarried? Yes.

The fifth element should be in the middle... ...and then the weapon against evil should work. You've never seen this work before, have you? No. Every weapon has a manual. I'm sure this has one too. That's it. That's it. Match up the symbols. Go! Go! Wind. My man, what you doing? - What? - What you doing? Trying to keep you in the DJ business. Fire.

Listen, I know you're very tired. I know you're very tired. I'll take you on a vacation when we're done. I swear, just you and me. But if you don't do something right now, we're all gonna die. You understand? What's the use of saving life when you see what you do with it? It'll be entering the atmosphere in 40 seconds. KORBEN: Leeloo, you're right. But there are some things... ...very nice things worth saving, some beautiful things. Beautiful things. Like love? Yes, love. That's good. That's good. That's a good example. Like love. Love is worth saving. I don't know love. I don't know love. I was built to protect, not to love. So there's no use for me other than this. No, no, no, you're wrong. You're wrong. You're wrong. I need you. I need you, very much. Why? Because... Because... Tell her, Korben. Tell me. Please. Why do you need me? - Because... - Tell me. - Tell me. - Because I... Because I love you. I love you.
