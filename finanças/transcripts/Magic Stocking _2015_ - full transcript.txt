Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho! Oh! Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! Hey! I swear, I'm just losing money coming to work. Oh, you mean "Guilt Santa"? I know exactly how much money's in that jar... it's mostly mine. I'm so sorry that I'm late. I had to drop Hannah off at a friend's. Oh, is she getting excited for Christmas? Yeah. And certain she's getting a puppy. -Ouch. -I hate being the Grinch. I thought this was the year your heart grew three sizes. I'm ready to decorate, but a puppy? No. Don't worry. She won't blame you forever. Oh, by the way... the Mayor hired someone. To restore the gazebo? By Christmas Eve. Why this wasn't planned six months ago, I have no idea. Fred Barnes plan ahead? Remember last summer, when he went out for lunch on a Tuesday, then he spontaneously drove to the airport... Spontaneity is the spice of life. Besides, we've only just discovered it's the 75th anniversary of the tree-lighting ceremony, -Right? -Good morning, Fred. Good morning. How are promotions going? Great! I've already spoken to "The Tribune" and Channel 11. Both are going to do stories, but Judy Keen, the General Manager over at Channel 11, she says she isn't sure she can get a camera crew here on Christmas Eve, considering the late notice. Oh, it'll be a terrific show. Who wouldn't want to be here? -Well, Fred... Fred! -Come on and meet Scott. I know this is a challenge, but it's been over 30 years since Gilford has had its tree-lighting ceremony. Let's restore the gazebo to exactly what it was when it was first built, when that first big tree was lighting up the whole square. Okay, well, the thing is, Fred, I think it's irresponsible for anyone to promise that it can be restored on such short notice. I mean, maybe we should just be focusing on the tree? Nonsense! Where there's a will, there's a way. It's gonna be perfect. Scott! I'd like you to come and meet Lindsey Monroe from our city planning department. Lindsey, Scott Terrell. Hey. Hey. How you doing? Nice to meet you. Well, a lot of work between now and Christmas Eve, huh? Uh, yeah. You see, we're planning a big celebration. Very big. There's gonna be a lot of publicity, and I just... I would hate for you to make a promise that you couldn't deliver on. I always deliver on a promise. Okay, uh... Great, uh... You see, we're kind of putting all of our eggs in one basket here, so, if it isn't finished, all of those eggs are gonna end up on my face... not to mention the Mayor's reputation. -So... -Yeah. Um... you see, we're promoting this as a very big... Celebration. Yeah. You said that. I think your basket's safe. Providing we can get past one slight hiccup. I... I don't like hiccups. Well, currently, there's no reference to the actual finished structure of the gazebo, so... So? Well, the intent was for it to be exactly as it was, right? So I've looked for some photos, some sort of reference, but I keep coming up empty. I can't actually start on the gazebo until I know what it looked like. While I appreciate your attention to detail, I really... I don't think anyone is gonna know the difference. I will. What the people of Gilford will notice is if it's half-finished. -It won't be. -It can't be. Provided we find a reference to the original. "We"? Yeah. I mean, "we" are in this together, right? See? You both have the will to get this done. I'm counting on it. Gilford's counting on it. This is the season of miracles. Which is what it might take. Hey. It's nice to meet you. Yeah. You too. Lindsey, please tell me when your mother arrives. She's coming up from Florida again this year for Christmas, right? Everyone will know when my mother arrives. Excellent. Come on! Come on! All the good stuff is probably gone already! The answer is still "no". Do you want to hold her? Yes, please! Hello, Sweetpea. Ah-hah. Please? Oh, please, oh, please? We are not getting anything that requires food. Or a sponge. But I'll take care of him. I'll do everything myself. You won't even know that he's in the house. I promise, I cross my heart. You may cross your heart, sweetie, but it'll be my cross to bear. He's my favorite, too. His name's "Magic." "Magic." Bye, Magic. Bye! Are you looking for anything in particular? Oh, well, um... My daughter and I, we've decided to get some new decorations. Just something simple. Well, how about some tree ornaments? Oh, well, I'm... I'm not sure that we'll get a tree just yet. Mom! Mom. Mrs. O'Neal says that the puppies are free and that all the shots have been paid for. She just wants to find them a good home. Maybe Mrs. O'Neal should pick on someone her own size. Tell you what. Here's 10 bucks. Knock yourself out. Why don't you get a stocking? Fine. My mom always gets sad this time of year. It was usually my dad who did the decorations. You know what? I have one I think would be perfect for both of you. It's a little old, a little used... but it has lots of charm. How much? Well, if you buy something else, I probably could give it to you for nothing. Sweet! I've got 10 bucks. Well, that's a start. Let's go and see what we have here. Lindsey Monroe! How are you, dear? Finally gonna crack open that purse this year? Oh! Well, um, Hannah is in need of something a little more her age. I love this. Real antique. All they need is a little shine and a good polish. How much? Buy them all... and I'll give you a price. Look, my nephew just moved back to Gilford. Magician at fixing things. No extra charge! And... he's single. Hah! Well, um... They're linin' up for him. I'll settle for free delivery. - Deal. - Great. Hi, Mom. Hey! How'd you do? Good. I hope you didn't pay 10 bucks for this. Oh, no. That was free. I paid 10 bucks for this. It looks perfect. Thanks, Ruth. -Bye, Hannah. -Bye! Are you excited? Yes. Hold this. Okay. You really wanted this old thing, huh? Hey! Look what I found. Score! Do you want it? Nah, you found it. It's yours. Mm. I think the clasp is broken. See? Looks perfect. Sorry, um, I thought they were decorations. No, um, it's okay, sweetie. I'll just go put them back. -Hello, Bug! -Grandma! She's here. -Sweetheart. -Hey, Grandma! Oh! Oh... How was your drive? Terrific. Hey, sugar! A Christmas tree. Well, you did say you were all-in this year. More than usual, yes, but... And who doesn't want a Christmas tree? Huh? And it starts... Uh, Fred Barnes told me to say hello. Honestly, that man. He saw me drive through town. I'm afraid I will never hear the end of it. He's a nice man. He's an old coot! You went to school together! You're the same age! I'm an independent woman. Free as the birds. He's been chasing me for years, so please do not encourage him. Ooh... Okay. A big push, honey. I really think it goes better over there. Nonsense. It's perfect. Got a surprise for you, Bug. Huh? What do you think? Um... What do you say, Hannah? I love it? I gotcha both. I know. It's awful. I bet... this is more your style. I love it! Thanks, Grandma! You're welcome, darling. Just a little something extra. Tell me, Bug. What do you really want for Christmas? I'm not allowed to say. A boyfriend? Ew! Gross. A puppy. I'm not sure if I'll be able to help you out there, Honey. Mom! What? I'm gonna go try this on. And I am going to make dinner. Oh, I've already got dinner planned. That's okay, honey. So do I. It's Fred. I'm sure it's Ruth's nephew with the furniture I bought at the sale. You? Hi. Apparently, you bought some things from my aunt. You're Ruth's nephew? That's me. Where do you want it? I'll show you, handsome. Excuse me. Uh, it should go over in that corner. Why don't we let Hannah decide? -I like it there. It's great. -I'll meet you outside. Uh, yeah, sorry about that. I can't find the key anywhere. I'll keep looking, otherwise I'll just replace the lock. Oh, it's fine. Thank you. All right. Uh, Scott... Um... we were just about to start dinner. Would you like to join us? Oh. Well... You know, actually, I can't. I appreciate it. Uh, I'm behind on our work, and there's lots to do, so... Yes. I'll walk you out. Good idea. All right. Thank you. Thank you again. You did a terrific job, it looks brand-new. Ah, that wasn't any trouble. It was all there, just below surface. And I'm happy that it's going to a good home. That used to belong to my grandparents. Ohh. Well, I can only that hope the gazebo and the rest of the town square looks half as good. If I get it finished on time, right? When it gets finished on time. Ah-hah. "Ah-hah," what? I saw it. You blushed when you opened the door. What are you talking about? He's restoring the town square... far too meticulously, if you ask me. It's never gonna get done on time, and I'm the one that's gonna have to answer for it. Mm. I know that look. He really liked you. That was obvious. A woman knows. Okay, well, I know this might shock you, but you're wrong. Besides, I'm not ready for that. So please, don't do your thing. What thing? The thing where you try and control my life. I just don't like seeing you alone, that's all. Miss "Independent." Miss "Free as a Bird." It's different for me. You're young. You've got your whole life in front of you. Yeah, well... it still hurts, Mom. I know it does, darling. I thought I was ready for all this... but every decoration is just another reminder. I'm just doing all this for Hannah. As you should. But you should also do it for yourself. For what it's worth, I think getting Hannah a puppy is a great idea. Mm. Mm-hmm. Dinner was absolutely lovely, Mom. Thank you. -You liked it, huh? -I loved it. Yes. Thank you. I'm going to make some tea. You know, I would love a cup of tea. This is so awesome! What? Whoa! Oh, my gosh! What? I didn't mean to look! I am so sorry that I looked, but I was just decorating the tree, and then it was on the floor, and I didn't think that there would be anything in it until Christmas. What are you talking about? This! It even has the name "Magic" on it. How did you know? At the rummage sale! "Magic" was the puppy I wanted. Thank you, thank you! Huh... Yay! Did you... I didn't do it! It was empty! I-I found that silver pendant, but that was it, there was nothing else. Sweetie, I know you want a puppy, but this isn't the way to go about it. I didn't put it in there either, I swear. I was just decorating the Christmas tree when I turned around, and there it was, on the floor. On the floor? It just fell down by itself? I don't know! Hannah, this isn't funny. I didn't put it in there. Then somebody else is playing a very bad joke. I'm innocent! Debbie O'Neal. Who? Debbie. She was giving away puppies at the rummage sale. She must have slipped it in the stocking as we were leaving. Clever, I'll give her that. Debbie would never do that. How else do you explain it? You said it yourself. It was empty. Well... obviously, it just must have gotten stuck in the fabric and I didn't see it. Does this mean I'm not getting a puppy? No, sweetie. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Bug. Oh, no. Oh, Donna? It's Fred! Yeah. Can I come in? He is my boss. You should at least talk to him. Shush, shush, shush. I can hear you shushing! I think the temperature has dropped another two degrees. Maybe three? Oh, my. Hi, Fred. Hello, Lindsey. For you, my dear. I saw you drive through town, and I wanted to say hello and wish you a merry Christmas. They're... very pretty. Thank you. Well, uh... Goodnight, Fred. You are a total hypocrite! Do as I say, not as I do. Grandma, do people your age really go on dates? Flowers... Again. Yes. There are more, where these came from. I hope you don't feel I'm being obnoxious. I let you drift away all those years ago and I-I can't let that happen again without a good fight. I won't be dissuaded. Nor will I. Mom! Don't encourage him! The man is a menace. The man knows what he wants. I think it's sweet. So do I. Hmm! You've got to be kidding! Honestly, Fred... I bought out the entire shop! You haven't seen the half of 'em. I may be here all night. Fred... What's is the matter with you? People will never vote for you ever again if they see you acting like this. I could care less about politics, as long as you'll say "yes" to a date. Okay. Anything! All right. We will all go out with you. Lindsey, Hannah, and me. Accepted. Goodnight! How's it going? Well, it's not proving as easy to refurbish as that old furniture. Well... I managed to find these for you at the historical society. They're not exactly what you're looking for, but it's all that I could track down, I'm sorry. I'm sure you could make it up. There's plenty of references to old gazebos there. You just want to get it done, huh? Yeah, I-I do. Rebuilt, refurbished, restored... it's gonna look great, as long as it's finished. Well, it will, but it won't be authentic, which is kind of the point. So where are we at with the lights? Well, they're gonna be vintage, too. We'll string 'em all across the whole square, all leading to the Christmas tree. -Great! When do they get here? -Any day. You haven't ordered them yet, have you? Nope. I was kind of hoping to get a reference on those as well. Okay, I don't need to remind you that my reputation... ...Reputation is on the line, yes. Yours too. Do you want to go to dinner? I'm sorry, what? Dinner. You, me. Restaurant. Are you asking me on a date? Oh, call it what you like. I just thought we'd, you know, discuss this in a more formal setting. I can't do that. Why not? Because... I can't do that. If you want to, um, my daughter and I, we're going to dinner tonight with the Mayor and my mother. My mom would not go out with him unless we went too, and I'm sure no one would mind if you came along. "Nobody would mind." Wow! That is, uh, quite the invite. Would you like to come along? Nope. Okay, sure. All right. Um... I'll have Fred call you. Sounds like a plan. You do that. Agreed. No, no! No. No, you can't say a thing. It has to be a surprise for both of them. Gotta go. Is the Mayor gonna do it? I told him I'd accept a real date if he does. Shh! What are you two talking about? Nothing. Just letting Fred know that we're on our way. You know, I still don't understand how we got roped into chaperoning your date. So it wouldn't be a date. Ah! Here they are. Hey, Fred. Hello. Lovely to see you. Scott. Have a lovely dinner. - Get in! Quick! - Okay! -Mom! -Mayor? Wait! Mom! I cannot believe that woman. I can't believe he was ever elected. Oh. All right. Uh... So, should I just take you home? Oh, gosh, no, of course not. Oh? Dinner? Sure. Yes. Yes. -Yeah? -Yes. High-five! -We did it! -We did. Thanks so much for including me. I just love a good prank. That was great! So, tomorrow, right? That was the deal. Yes. All right, you two. Goodnight. Goodnight, Fred. Goodnight, Mayor. To my crazy mother... Yeah, and the impeachment of the mayor. I'll drink to that. Wasn't that fun tonight? Oh, yeah! Oh! I'm going to plug in all the lights. I want it to be all lit up when Mom gets home. Things are likely to get lit up, all right. Come here. I'm not going to hurt you. Oh! Come here. Oh... It's okay. Shh... Goodnight, Grandma! Going to bed already? Yep! Goodnight. Goodnight, Bug. So after all the places you traveled in the world, you decided to come back here? Yeah, well, home is where the heart is. That's what they say anyway. Or where you hang your hat. That's not nearly as romantic. Well, we moved away when I was a kid, but I always came back for the summers. I love it here, you know? I spent a lot of time with my grandfather. You know, the truth is, I was the one that suggested we restore the old gazebo and the square, not the Mayor. So I have you to thank? Mm-hmm! Yeah, I want this to be a gathering place, you know? Where people come together, and we have parties, and celebrate. and events, and... That's the kind of thing that binds a community. That's great, but why does it need to be restored exactly as it was? I mean, I'm sure the person who built this in 1940 would not mind. That person... was my grandfather. It was his dream to restore it. My grandfather built it after the war. We were supposed to do it together... but he passed away unexpectedly while I was traveling... Well, I thought we'd have more time. I didn't mean to compare my grandfather's passing to what you went through. I'm sorry. Oh, so you know about... Yes. It's terrible what you went through. This must be a really hard time for you and Hannah. It's getting better. So... what else do you know about me? Oh, ho. Where do we start? Uh... I mean, this is Gilford, so... Uh, let me see. I know your favorite color is blue, your favorite food is Italian, and you own every Bruce Springsteen album. My favorite color is green. Oh! Right. Sorry. So this isn't just a job... this is personal. I could restore it any other way, and you're right, nobody would know the difference, but my grandfather's work would be forgotten, and I made a promise to him. And you're a guy who keeps his promises? Yeah. I had a nice time tonight. It's still early. We could... you know? No. I-I think I'm gonna go home. I'll give you a ride. No. I'll walk. It's not far. It's-It's a nice walk. I-I like the walk. Ohh... Thanks... for dinner. Absolutely. So? I'm not speaking to you. Oh, don't be a sourpuss. Sarah Jean called from the restaurant, said that you two were having a delightful time. Gilford. What are you doing? Just thought I'd fill out the tree. Don't worry, there's plenty here for you and Hannah. Why are you putting those ones up? Well, you always had these on your tree. They're... sweet. Those were special to me and Doug. I wasn't ready to have them out. You said that you were ready to decorate again this year, so I just thought... No, Mom, I said that I was going ease into it. You... you bring in a Christmas tree, you trick me into going on a date, you go through my things without any idea of what those ornaments mean. I know it's with the best intentions. I put one toe in the water, and you push me all the way in. You're right. You're right. Uh... I'll take them down. No. No, no, no, no. Leave them up. It's fine. I couldn't find the "Four Calling Birds." Yeah. They were lost. When we found this set... they were just so vintage and... unusual. He loved them. He said that the "Four Calling Birds" reminded him of our family dream. He always thought that we'd have two kids, or at least one kid and a dog, and there'd be four of us. Four calling birds. It's silly. It isn't silly. It goes against my very nature not to interfere. Oh, really? Mm. So... I am going to apologize now for the next time I do. Goodnight, Mom. Mm. Mwah! Goodnight, Sugar. Shh... shh. Why are you so dressed up? I promised Fred we'd go out on a real date if he went along with that little scheme of ours. Anyway, he's picking me up this morning. Said he wanted to do something unusual. Oh? Not sure exactly what that means, but I'm willing to go along. Oh, hey! You're not off the hook either, young lady. What's the matter? Nothing is the matter. Why would you think something is the matter? Uh, 'cause you're not gloating from your little prank last night. What was that? It's not my fault! Mom? Innocent. Oh... I found him when I was plugging in the lights. He was cold and wet and I couldn't just leave him out there. Ooh. I didn't have anything to do with this, I swear! He is so cute! They're always cute. Aww. Can I keep him? Mom? Please? He doesn't have a collar, so he must not belong to anybody. I've already named him "Magic." All right, he stays for now, sweetie, but you're putting up posters. I'm sure somebody's looking for him. Okay. Oh, boy. Hi! What are you wearing? We're going fishing, of course. I brought an extra rod, just assuming that you didn't have one. Fred, you're a nice man. Even a handsome man. And I know you're not a stupid man. Do you see how I'm dressed? You look beautiful. Does this scream "fishing" to you? Ice-fishing... technically. It's very safe and it's a lot of fun. And I'm willing to bet that you've never done it. Safe bet. I should've given you fair warning, I grant you that, but I was concerned that you might say no. You're two for two. Well, I've got extra winter gear you can change into, so... Come on. I promise, it'll knock your socks off. Karma is a beautiful thing. Mom... what kind of dog was Dad going to get me? How did you know Dad was getting you a dog? Did Grandma tell you that? No. He did. He told me not to tell you I knew. Was it gonna be the same kind of dog? Well, I'm not sure. Why? I just thought... maybe he's the one who made sure I found him. Sweetie, I know your Dad is looking out for you all the time. I believe that with all my heart, but there are some things that are really just a coincidence. What if it's not? What if I was really supposed to find him, and nobody claims him? If nobody claims him, I'll be open to keeping him. Pinky swear? Pinky swear. We're still putting up posters. I know. I've already got our next adventure in mind. Don't push your luck. I believe in pushing my luck every day. Keeps me young. Well, I will consider that when I can feel my feet again All right. Donna, I know I come on too strong. I know that's not attractive. Women like a mystery, they like the chase. Well, there's no mystery here. There's just a guy who wants to treat you like the lady you are. Well, who says that's not attractive? I read it in Cosmo. Cosmo? Yeah. Goodnight, Fred. Goodnight. Ahh! Huh. Okay... you're joking. I'm telling you the truth. No, you... you found it in the garage. Or you did, Hannah. I didn't! No. I found it, in the stocking. I couldn't believe it myself. I mean... the date even matches your set...1947. So wait. You're saying it just appeared inside the stocking? Just like Magic's nametag? I didn't... I didn't see it actually appear. Look, I came inside, I saw the stocking on the floor. When I picked it up, the ornament was inside. So it was Fred. Fred didn't even come inside the house! He must have somehow slipped it into the stocking. Lindsey! How could he possibly know that that was the missing ornament, or that you even had this collection at all? In this town? Everybody knows everything. So, then he, what? He broke into the house when we were all out? You're both wrong! It wasn't anybody at all. It was the stocking. Think about it. I wanted a puppy more than anything, and what did I find? Magic's nametag. Mom. Your silver heart... Yes? It's broken, remember? No. I fixed it. See? That doesn't count. It's not fixed, is it? So, then how does finding your Mom's missing ornament help me, kiddo? We just have to wait and see. Okay, things do not appear out of nowhere. Exactly! Which means it really is magic. -Hannah! -I mean... the nametag says it all. "Magic." Hello! -Hannah... -Mom! -You just have to believe. -Hannah! There is no magic. Okay, I need to get to work. The "Guess the Coins" competition is at 3:00. Please be there. Wouldn't miss it. It is magic, Grandma. I know it. I'm beginning to think so, too, Bug. Hello, Lindsey. How's your mother? Ah. I think she can finally feel her toes again. Good. Don't forget... Wilson promised a deal on the tree. Have Scott go with you. -Hi. -Hey. I'm sorry for running off on you like that. I just... I haven't been out on... I know. I had fun. Yeah, it was fun. I guess we got your mom to thank for that? Ah, yeah, well... Her heart's in the right place. Is yours? I'm working on it. How about this one? Well, that's not gonna fit in your car. Oh, gosh. How are we gonna get it to town? Uh... I'll just carry it. Naturally. Okay. I think... Oh! Sorry! That didn't go as planned. Uh, we'll take it. A little help? Oh! Wow, you've been working out. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm good. A little sappy, but... Oh, is that yours? Oh, gosh... Yeah. The, um... The clasp, it keeps breaking. I can't seem to fix it. Oh, I can try and fix it for you. If you want. Yeah. I'd like that. All right. All right, folks. Just five more minutes remaining to make your guess in our "Guess The Amount of Coins" competition. The winner will be Grand Marshal next to yours truly, for our 75th annual tree-lighting ceremony on Christmas Eve. We don't even know how much is in here, do we? - No! - No. Hey, come on, you've gotta get your guesses in now. What do you think? Grandma, how big is that coin jar? I don't know. Oh, I would say 20 gallons, maybe? Looks mostly like... pennies and nickels. Come up with something quick, Bug, Time's ticking. Say $1,050? All right, let's get it in there. Yeah. -Don't forget your name. -Yup. Good job. Hannah! Good. Excellent. Last chance, folks. Get those entry forms in now. Don't miss out on your chance to be Grand Marshal next to me on Christmas Eve. To light the tree. Donna? With me. The man is relentless. -Oh, thank you, Scott. -Thanks, Scott. What do you got there? Grandma found it in our magic stocking. "Magic stocking"? "12-25-1947." How 'bout that? What? Well, that was the year my grandfather built the original gazebo. Oh! See? Oh. What? What are you doing? 1,225... 47. "Donna." Donna? Looks like you're gonna get an entry anyhow now, Mom. -No, no, no. -Come on, Grandma. Good job, Hannah! Oh, Hannah. Good! Another one. Thank you. All right, that's it, folks. Okay. While we're sorting through your entries, let's find out how much is in here. Let 'er rip! That's a sight for sore eyes, folks! So far, looks like our lowest guess is $515. Past $800 now! Wow! That's all my money. As of now, our highest guess is $1,225.47 from... Donna Chastain! Whoo! Good luck, Donna. And right down to the penny, I like that. $1,000! Wow! -Oh, ho! -Oh, great. It continues to climb! $1,100! It's slowing down now. 1,150. That's a great contribution to Gilford's Helping Hands Foundation. Thanks, everybody. Oh! The coins have finished. And the machine is computing... And it's looking like Donna's guess is gonna be pretty darn close. Final count is... $1,225 and... ...47 cents. Uh... Well, an exact match! That's amazing! Come on up and accept your prize, Donna. We have a soothsayer amongst us, folks. The great thing is that all of that $1,225.47 goes directly to Gilford's Helping Hand Foundation. Awkward. Well, congratulations. You rigged it, didn't you? I did no such thing. Can't say I wouldn't have tried, though. Wonderful, folks! Well, thank you all for coming, and we'll see you at the tree lighting. Get me out of here, before I am burned at the stake. Excuse us. Now I really need to see what's in that stocking. It's magic! Oh, we'll see. See? Just a normal stocking. Nobody's saying it spins in circles and shoots off lightning bolts. Exactly, and it had nothing to do with... With what? See? You can't explain it either. There's nothing to explain! It's just... one of those things. What things? Mom, would you please not feed into this? The numbers were exact. People win the lottery all the time... far worse odds than that. Listen to yourself. Listen to yourself! What are you saying, exactly? That it's actually a magical stocking? Yes! See? I don't know what it is, but I do know it's not something that we can just brush off as "one of those things." Okay. Remember when I was a kid, and Dad used to do all those magic tricks, and take us to all those magic shows, and I always thought it was real? But it wasn't. There was always a trick. The real trick... was believing, Lindsey. Where are you going? You know what? I think Hannah's right. I think it's a sign. What? Are you going to see Fred? Remember everything I said about being an independent woman, free as a bird? -Yes! -Well, I still am, but it doesn't mean that I can't go out and have some fun. You might just take note. Who's trying to stop her? Grown-ups are always trying to stop themselves from everything, mostly the fun stuff. Yeah, it's called being responsible. Who said you have to be responsible all the time? You got me there, kiddo. Mm-mwah! Lindsey! What a nice surprise. How are you, dear? I'm fine, thank you. Service doesn't start for a couple hours. Are you here to get a front-row seat? Uh, no. Actually, I was hoping you might help me with something. Of course. Okay, this might sound a little strange, but I was wondering if you... okay, do you remember a lady... she was selling stockings and other decorations at the rummage sale? She was a little older, silver hair, very nice, not from around here. Yeah. Yeah, I do. I never quite got her name, though. Well, do you have a phone number, an email address? I'm afraid not. Why? It's a long story. Ahh. Always is. You know, I thought you might've known her. Why? She said something when you left the rummage sale, just in passing... Think she was pleased you came to her booth. What did she say? It was more of how she said it. It came across as familiar. It's like she knew what happened... and that she had done something to help, and felt glad she was able to. You don't know anything about her? Not even her name? No. I'm sorry. It's a real mystery. Yeah, it is. Well... thank you, Reverend. You're welcome. Hey! Door's always open. Oh, don't be ridiculous. Hannah! Yes? Where's the box I had over here? I think Grandma put it in the garage... Yeah, she said she was giving stuff away. Did you have a nice time? Oh! Lindsey. You scared me. Oh, Lindsey. I don't know where to begin. We hit the town, I kicked the dust off my shoes, one thing after another. And you're not gonna believe this! We went sledding. I haven't been sledding in over 30 years! Oh, it was exhilarating. What's wrong? Is there anything else you were going to give away? Other than his clothes? This is going to be bad, isn't it? It's one thing for you to decorate and reorganize... but to give away his clothes? I'm sorry. I thought they were boxed up for the donation. Not that one. Lindsey, I have said I'm sorry more often than I can count, and I'm not gonna apologize anymore, but I am gonna give you my advice. It's been three years. You need to move on. Not to forget, not to pretend that it didn't happen, but to allow yourself to feel happy again! It's taken this long for Hannah to have a real Christmas. The holidays have been hard for Hannah, too. She wasn't ready either. She's ready now. I talk big about being an independent woman, free as a bird, but guess what? I just had the time of my life with a man I've been avoiding for years... No, no. Let me finish. I'm not saying that you're supposed to get married, or that... or that you're not supposed to feel a little twinge of guilt when you look at another man, but, Honey, you're going to have pain for the rest of your life. But it doesn't mean that you can't have a life. I am trying. No! You're not. Mom, this has been a big step for me, but you... But you keep trying to find reasons to take two steps back. I know, because I've done this my whole life! You're the happiest person I know. I thought I was. You really like him. Yeah. Yeah, I do. I'm very happy for you, Mom. Lindsey. I do have some pearls of wisdom to pass on, so would you stop being so darn stubborn? I am not. I want to be open to someone, I really do. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's what this is all about. You don't like Scott. No... I never even considered that. I mean, I just assumed. He's charming and handsome... I just thought it was mutual. I never even considered the possibility that you might not even like him. I like him! Okay? I do. And it's just making all of this... What? Real? Come here, Sugar. A great philosopher once said, "You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because, finally, reality is better than your dreams." I'm gonna be up all night. I just... want my little girl's eyes to be open to whatever possibilities there are out there for her. Life is too good to pass up. I know. Who was that great philosopher? Dr. Seuss. All right, sweetie, why don't you put up another puppy poster? Do I have to? Nobody's called. It's the right thing to do. Aren't you supposed to be putting that together, and not the other way around? It isn't right. Well, I think your grandfather would be happy that it's even being restored at all. I mean, the point is to honor him by doing it the way he did it. Yes, but we're running out of time. Yeah, I know. It's just... Maybe you should take your mind off it for a little bit... you've been working non-stop. Come to the dance with us. Yeah! What dance? The Christmas Dance. We're all going. Yeah. She's right. It's a Gilford tradition around here. I don't dance. Oh, it doesn't matter. It's just fun. -Yeah? -Yeah! All right. Great! ♪ ...Jingle all the way ♪ ♪ In a one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ Gliding through the snowy meadow ♪ ♪ Laughing all the way... ♪ Trying to hide? Me? No! No... I'm just... You know, waiting, for Santa. Oh, okay. Come on! Really? Excuse me. I'm gonna go embarrass myself. The trick... is to dance like no one is watching. Ha! This is Gilford. Everybody's watching. Yeah? ♪ ...Merry Christmas Day ♪ Shall we? Sure. So serious. ♪ ...Your lips... ♪ ♪ Taste like candy... ♪ Hi-i-i-i! Hi. Hi. That scared me. Me too. They're like little ninjas. ♪ ...Forever in love You'll see... ♪ You're right. It's not that hard once you get used to it. ♪ ...When you smile at me... ♪ He-e-ey. Hey! Hi there. Wanna dance? Yeah! Get on in here. Come on. Let's see a twirl. Beautiful. You're quite the dancer. Runs in the family. Ahh! Thank you. I heard you tell Grandma you like him. Yeah. I kind of do. Is that okay? I like him, too. Good. I think he's gonna need all the help he can get to get the gazebo finished in time. I want to help. Me too. All right. Goodnight, sweetie. Get some sleep, all right? Goodnight, Mom. I love you. Magic, what is it? Magic, what is it? A key? Magic, come on. Come here. Hannah! Breakfast! Okay! Hey, so, Grandma's in the shower, but I've gotta run. Oh... And Scott, he wanted me to tell you that he hasn't forgotten about the lock on your desk, but he's gonna fix it after he's done with the festival. Mwah! Love you. Love you, too, Mom. Bye! The drawer! Magic, come on! Thanks, guys. Tree looks great, Lindsey. Thank you. But now, what about our friend, Scott? The gazebo doesn't look anything like done, and I still don't see any lights. He is a little behind schedule, but he promises it's going to be finished. We're all gonna pitch in. Do what you can, please, because we now have double the number of people who're gonna be there, including the press. Right. Got it. Come on. We gotta go tell Grandma. Grandma! How's it coming? Well, we got the structure done, but we can't actually finish it. Well... can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. Hey, guys, give us five, huh? Thanks. What's up? Look... I know what all this means to you, but I think you've got to let it go. Yeah? What about the promise to my grandfather? I understand what you're feeling, I really do, but unfortunately, they don't. They don't think that you can finish this on time. And I... I think you have to move on. That's not so easy, is it? No. It's not. They think I let them down. But you haven't. We can still finish this. I know we can. Yeah, well, we'll see. Mom! Mom! Hannah? Hannah, what are you doing here? Look at this. What? What is it? Last night, I found a key in the stocking. You found it in the stocking? You have to believe me, okay? I found the key in the stocking, okay? And it unlocked the drawer in my desk! And there was a hidden compartment, and... This is exactly what he's looking for! -I know! -Honey! That desk is his grandfather's desk! It's so amazing! Scott! Look! It's the gazebo! Yes! Where'd you get these from? Hannah found them. You gotta be kidding me! Where? In your grandfather's desk. Look. -This is exactly what we need. -I know! All right, guys, bring that wood over here, and put that box on this side. Hey, so I've been scouring the Internet and I think I found the only place that sells a match for these lights... exact replicas... a little antique shop in Ohio. That's great. When do they get here? Waiting to hear back. We need this. It would be the finishing touch. Ohh! Good luck. Thanks. Everything good? -Yeah. Great. -Okay. Two days, you're sure? That's... That's great. Yeah, no, just e-mail me the tracking number. All right. Thanks. Well? They said they'd get the lights here in two days. You're absolutely certain? Yeah, they guaranteed it. Exact replicas of the ones originally used. The town square is gonna look just like it did when your grandfather built it. Well, that was my promise to him. Congratulations. Honestly, I couldn't have pulled this off without all of your help. I really appreciate it. And you! Little one... finding those photographs... Looks like we found our miracle. 'Tis the season. In the back. What's going on, kiddo? Nothing. Something is the matter. I don't want to talk about it, okay? Okay. I don't like seeing you like this, honey. You know you can tell me anything, right? I know. All right. Well, we're gonna help out again tomorrow, get an early start, so try to get some sleep, okay? Okay. Okay. I love you. Goodnight. Goodnight, Mom. I love you. Goodnight, sweetie. I won't let anybody take you away. Never. -Hi. -Morning. -Are you ready? -Yes, yes. My mom and Fred, they're gonna meet us there. Sounds good to me. All hands on deck. I don't want to have anything left to do on Christmas Eve but enjoy the festival. Yeah, me too. Hey, Hannah! Come on, sweetie! It's time to go! Good morning, Hannah. Hi. You know, mothers have simple hopes for their children. One of them is that they'll wake up in a better mood in the morning than they were when they went to bed. Okay... Mom? Would you please tell me what in the world is going on? Oh, honey... When did you find this? At the coffee shop. I didn't want to tell anybody. Oh... I don't blame you. Maybe it's a different puppy. Look at the photo, honey. And it says he went missing on the same night that you found him. I'm sorry, Hannah. That really stinks. Do we have to call them? It's not fair that they can just take him away now. What if I hadn't seen this? We wouldn't even know! It isn't fair, honey, but you did see it. And you did the right thing by telling me, and you gave him a great home, but it's not his home. We have to call them, don't we? Yeah. Come on, honey. What if they're mean people? Come on, sweetie. I'll wait right here. Thanks. Hi. We called. Oh, there he is! We were so worried! Thank you! You must be Hannah. Thank you for rescuing our little guy. Jake! Amber! Look who's here! What do you say to this young lady? Thank you! There was a reward, you know? No. It's okay. I don't want the reward. Well, I'd like you to have it. Tell you what... I'll donate it to the Happy Hound shelter under your name. Oh, that would be very nice. We were worried sick about him. You did a great thing, Hannah. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. You okay? No. Me neither. But I'm proud of you. Hannah? What are you doing, sweetie? It's almost midnight. I couldn't sleep. If it is magical... do you think it could give more than just what fits inside it? Like what? A person. I don't think that's how it works, sweetie. I know. You still don't believe it's magic, do you? If anything, I think it's proof that there are some things in this world that can't be explained easily. Maybe we're not meant to. Why would it let me find a puppy, just so I could give him away? You found that puppy on your own, Honey. But there has to be another reason. There's got to. It isn't finished. Well, maybe that nametag you found will still prove to be of some use. I'm not saying anything. I'm just saying "maybe". All right, come on, we got to go to bed or tomorrow will be an even tougher day than it was today. Can I sleep with you tonight? I was just gonna ask you the same thing. Come on. They're all so cute! You know, I think I'll just get a gift certificate, and let my daughter decide. -Good idea. -Thanks. Hannah? Mom! Look! A puppy! I... I see that. Hi. Hi. A new dog? Yeah. Look, I had no intentions of doing this, okay? I ran into Mrs. O'Neal, this little guy caught my eye. Look at his name. It's Magic, Mom! The one from the rummage sale. The one I wanted! It's amazing, Honey, isn't it? I mean, if that's isn't a sign, I don't know what is. Certainly is. It was very sweet of you, Scott. I'm sorry. No. It's fine. Can I keep him, Mom? Please? I'll walk him. I'll clean up after him. I'll do everything for him. Yes. Yes, of course. I'm not gonna send another one away, am I? Thank you! I should've called. I-I just got so excited. I thought you'd be here, and when Hannah opened the door, her face lit up. I bet it did. All right, uh, all right, I've gotta get to work. Some last-minute things on the gazebo. Those lights still haven't shown up. Oh. I'll call you later? Sure. Hannah, honey, what do you say to Scott? I love you! Uh... yeah. You're welcome. All right, kid. Call you later. Lindsey? It's fine. I haven't seen Hannah this happy in a long, long time. Lindsey... Don't punish Scott. I was getting her a dog. Yeah, well, he didn't know that. Poor guy had to watch her cry all the whole way home when you took the other one back. And then when he found the first one that she... He's not her father. He's not trying to be. What has made you so upset? It seems that everything to do with getting a dog sends you over the edge. It was the car accident. Doug was on his way to get Hannah a puppy. Oh, my goodness. She can never know that. Of course not. Lindsey... I had no idea. It was going to be the four of us. "Four Calling Birds." Lindsey, I need V.I.P. for two more Channel 11 people. And now Channel 4 wants placement, they're going to do a tag on tomorrow's broadcast. Can you call them, please? -On it. -Okay. I still don't see any lights up in that park. On it. It's gonna be mighty awkward when your mother and I pull the lever and whole town square's still in the dark. One to remember, anyway. Hi, Lindsey, it's Scott. I just wanted to call again and say that I was sorry. I completely understand why you're upset, but I still hope you come down for the festivities tomorrow. And keep your fingers crossed that we'll actually get those lights. Anyway... Merry Christmas. Excuse me! Would one of those be for Scott Terrell? Yeah? Hello! Door's open! Hey, Merry Christmas, everybody. Hello, darling. You ready? Yes, I am. Well, then we can all ride together, if you like. Why don't the three of you go on ahead without me? What are you talking about? I'm just not feeling up for it, Mom. You're not going? This is just as much your event as anybody's. I know. I'm sorry. I just... Hannah, why don't you ride along with Grandma and Fred? Lindsey... You have to be there. We're not leaving without you. Please, you'll make me feel worse if you stay. Just go. Have fun. Maybe I'll meet up with you in a little bit. -You're sure? -Mm-hmm. I'll go get Magic. Hey, Mayor! Looks like we might actually make it. Terrific, Scott. Never a doubt. Wish I could say the same. Oh, she's still at home. Sorry, kiddo. Ah. Hey, Magic! How's he doing? He's awesome. Do me a favor? I need somebody to help me string the lights. What do you say? Sure! Grandma? You want me to take him? Thank you. Aww. There we go. That's great. Here. Take these. What am I supposed to do? I want to believe, okay? So help me out. Hi! Mom! You made it! I wasn't gonna miss out on all the fun, was I? No! Hey. Hey there. How can I help? Uh, hand me that pine cone. We've only got a few minutes left. -Here you go. -Thank you. Wow, it looks great. Grandma... We did it. Lindsey, I'm so glad you're here. Me too. Hey, there's only a few minutes left. You two better get up to the podium. Yeah, we better. -Do you want to take him back? -Oh, yeah. Well done, both of you. -Aw, thank you. -It looks great. -Oh, good job, Scott. -Thank you! Your grandfather would be so proud. It looks incredible. I appreciate that. You're the only one who really knows what this means to me. And as you can see, the lights came in. Exact replicas. Oh, no. Scott... What? Look. Oh, no, no, no, no. It's just one bulb. No, no, it's not. With these old lights, if one of 'em doesn't work, none of them work. -You mean...? -That's the entire square! -Don't we have another bulb? -No, we don't! Welcome to our 75th Christmas Tree lighting ceremony! I want to thank all the good folks at Gilford who made tonight possible. It's shot. It's not gonna work. When they flip that switch, it's just gonna be dark. -It won't. -It is. Unless you pray for another miracle. I already have. Do you believe in magic? What? Do you believe in magic? I do! I know you do. And you didn't put any of those things in the stocking, did you? -No. -I believe you. Wait here! -Where... -Mom! -Where's she going? -I don't know. I also want to thank all the volunteers who came out to help with the construction and the clean-up in the park. Now, without further ado... I want to give the honor of lighting up our lives to the beautiful Donna Chastain. Anything? No, I don't see her. I got to stop them. I see her! Mom! Here she is! What are we going to do? You're going to light up the square. I don't understand. I do. Go on! Hurry! -Okay, okay, okay, okay. -Come on, Scott! Come on! Quick, quick, quick! Grandma! Nice work, Scott Terrell. I couldn't have done it without you, Lindsey Monroe. I almost forgot... Got you a little present. Oh! Thank you for fixing this. Absolutely. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. -Hey! -Come here! -It looks so beautiful. -It does. Wow. Do you see him? Hey-hey, Lindsey. You're a little early. We're just setting up. Congratulations. Thank you. Ruth just can't stop talking about it. She thinks it's all because of her. Well, we may have had some other help. Hey, Reverend, is that same woman here this year? The one that I asked you about? She's setting up right now, in the corner, right over there. Thank you. There she is. Hi. Hi! We wanted to return this. Oh... We thought perhaps it could be passed on, To somebody else that can use it this year. That's how it works, isn't it? I'm sure someone else will find it just as lovely and meaningful. Let's go, kiddo. Thank you. Dear? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas!
