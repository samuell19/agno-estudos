Developing story out of Rabbit Hash, Ohio today as authorities are seeking information regarding several missing persons, including a large number of children that has left locals panicking. We have all the coverage here at WKLB in the morning. [Dispatcher] Detective McKinney to forensics, please. Detective McKinney to forensics, please. Deputy Harper, you're needed on level one. Deputy Harper to level one, please. I just got off the phone with their parents. They're on the way. Have you got anything out of 'em yet? Nothing in a while. The youngest seems out of it. Probably still in shock. We still can't find those missing kids. I think we're up to about 13 now. What happened to them two? Well, we picked them up wandering aimlessly down the road. The only thing we could get out of 'em was some evil lady in a hat and some Halloween ghouls took their friends. What's with the board? That I don't know about. But, mmm, probably a favorite toy or something. Well, let's get going. These missing kids aren't gonna find themselves. This time of year is the worst. I hate Halloween. Right. Trick or treat. No one believes us. We have to make sure what happened to us never happens again. How? By keeping this board out of someone else's hands. We closed the portal. The gateway is sealed. What if she comes back? She can't come back. They can't come back. Let's keep it that way. (dark eerie music) [Benny] When you're a kid, Halloween is about dressing up in costumes, getting candy, pulling pranks, and celebrating the spooky. You think the scary stuff around you is all for fun and that nothing can harm you. The reality is that's not true. ♪ She's a know better ♪ ♪ I don't wanna show better ♪ ♪ Not a go-getter ♪ ♪ Just another gold getter ♪ ♪ She's a know better ♪ ♪ I don't wanna show better ♪ ♪ She's a go-getter ♪ ♪ Just another gold getter ♪ Where you goin'? Nowhere, Benny. Absolutely nowhere. (Benny sighing) (soft solemn music) You goin' somewhere? Yes, unfortunately. I've been called in to work. One of the flight attendants I guess quit, so I'm gonna need for you to watch your brothers. Hard pass. Miah. Mom. (Mom sighing) Mom, I have no life outside of babysitting them. Stokely is 15, for Christ's sake. Did you have plans or something for tonight? No, I never have plans. That's not the point. Then what is the point? Look, help me out a little here. Hmm? I can't skip work. I need you to understand. You are now the man of the house. I don't want to be the man of the house. I just wanna be Miah. I know it has been hard since we lost your dad. We didn't lose. He ran off to Cancun with his secretary. Same thing. And for all I care, I hope he gets eaten by a shark. Well, this blows, so. Miah, please, please. Fine. Fine. Thank you. Hey. - Are you, uh, leaving? I am. I've been called in. I need you to listen to your brother. I need you to behave. - Okay. - Please. Thank you. Guys, I'm runnin' late. I love you all. Love you, too. Take care of them. I will. - Bye. - [Mom] Bye. Well, what do you wanna do? Come on, anus. (knuckles rapping) [Stokely] Yeah? Who is it? It's Miah. Open up. [Stokely] What's the password? Eat shit and die. Lucky guess. Cool. Whoa! What's this, Stokely? There's boobs? Yeah, it's a double version of "Die, Die Babe Masker 4." Do you have parts one, two and three? What do you mean? Of course I do. I own the whole series. And you're not watching any of them. What? Why not? I mean, Mom's gone, and it may do the little guy some good. You know? Because. No, no. - What? Why not? Come on. We're going into town. We're gonna rent us some movies or something. [Benny] What? Hopefully with less crappy acting. This is good acting. [Miah] Nope. Hey, oh, can we stop by Mabry's? There's something I wanna show you guys. [Miah] Whatever. Just hurry up. Hey. (snapping fingers) I'll show you later. Just don't tell Miah. (soft suspenseful music) Ooh. Hey! Guess who I saw the other day. I don't know, Stoke. Who? It was one Cammy Belanger. Did you talk to her? Oh yeah. I talked to her for hours. Talked about, let's see, school. Uh, her bra size. - There it is. Whether she prefers to wear underwear or go commando. And, wait for this one, your super creepy infatuation of her. You're not funny, ass. Is that the girl whose picture you're always staring at? - Shut up, Benny! - Dude, it totally is. I don't see why you haven't asked her out already. I don't know. Stoke. Maybe it's that she's way outta my league. Ah. Maybe it's her dick of a boyfriend. Man, screw Billy Masterson. He's an idiot meat head. Idiot meat head with a car and a license. Star running back that could pummel us into oblivion. Man, who cares what he does to hide his fragile, little ego. And plus, you and Cam have history, bro. Stokley, the class in the fourth grade is not history. End of conversation. Have it your way. He's your brother, not mine. (tense dramatic music) (bicycle chain clicking) (tense dramatic music) (bicycle tires crunching) (tense dramatic music) (upbeat rap music) Lookie, lookie. What have we got here? Check out the nerd herd. (intriguing rock music) [Billy] You might wanna be careful on these little bikes. It could be dangerous. [Cammy] Stop. Let's go. What? I'm just giving these diaper stains some friendly advice. No, you're not. You're being a douche bag. Are you guys okay? I mean, I'm not. That piece of trash almost hit me, man. What did you just call my car? You heard me. I called it a piece of trash. No, I didn't quite catch that, shit smear. I think you know what I said. That's what I thought. [Miah] Enough. Oh, shit! Are you about to do something, Mia? Muzzle your little bitch brother before I do. Okay, Billy. Stop. Come on. Fine. Have it your way. Next time, dick wad. Come on, sweet tits. Boop. See, the best way to handle Billy, just kick- Just shut the hell up, Stokely. I was just gonna say kick him in the dick, I mean. (upbeat rap music) (engine revving) (creepy piano music) [Announcer] Welcome back to our creature feature film. Hey, man. I was just, hey. Is that weed? - It's medicinal. - [Stokely] Right. Got a PTSD thing. I was just gonna show my two lame brothers all the cool stuff he got here. Yeah, man, go ahead. Just, you know, you break it, you buy it. All right. Now I see why you like this place so much. Will you shut up? God. There it is. What is it? It's right there. [Miah] Okay, but what is it? Somethin' catch your eye, guys? Oh, no. I was just showing them your collection here. Stokely. I caught you staring at that board several times this week. What did I tell you last time? - It's not for sale. - Right. Now if you guys are into the weird macabre shit, I've got plenty of other stuff you can check out. What is this supposed to be? Those symbols look Halloween-related or somethin'. Yeah. It's, uh, it's called the board of Zawan. In ancient times, you know, Halloween, Zawan was a time that the boundaries between dimensions was the thinnest and creatures could cross over from one dimension to the next, and that, that's what they used that for. You ever hear of the Narnia Chronicles? In those it's a wardrobe that opens. Narnia, seriously? What is wrong with you? Guys, this thing's cursed. All right, in fact there's not much in here that isn't cursed or haunted or tainted or somethin'. You ever thought about seeing what the bad boy can do? (soft eerie music) I'm sure you guys have heard of the 13 kids that went missing here 30 years ago. Well, yeah. All of them had contact with that board. All right? Screw with that thing, it never ends well. Leave it alone. Okay. (soft eerie music) We gotta get that thing. - Nope. - Come on. Guys, I'm all for having a good time, but do we really wanna do this? Dude, where is your sense of adventure? I don't know, Stoke. Maybe my common sense is obscuring it. Aren't you just a bit curious? Curious of what? If we can get away with burglary? No, what the hell it does. If it works. I mean, Mabry said that thing was tied to all those disappearances, and that's like the only thing this place is known for. All the more reason not to mess with it. Hello. "Hell raiser," "Evil Dead," "Jumanji," "The Ring." All good movies. There's obviously a good reason it's not for sale. Come on, Miah. We don't get to do anything fun anymore. (Miah sighing) You guys are gonna get us into so much shit over this. So, uh, you in? I'm not stealin' anything. I'll keep watch or whatever, but I refuse- [Cammy] What are you guys doing? Hey, Cammy. You guys look like you're plotting something or scheming or whatever. What are you doing? (chuckling) No, we, no, we, um. We're trying to get something from the store. So go buy it. (Stokely laughing) Wow, Paris, you're like a genius. If it were only that simple. See, the thing we're after, he's not selling. We're going for a one, two, five-finger discount. So what is it? It's this stupid spirit port thing. It's dumb. [Cammy] Spirit port? Cool. [Paris] Gross. - Cool? - Yeah, totally. I love stuff like that. [Boys] You do? (engine starting) - We'll help. - No, we won't. You, mmm-hmm. Okay. Um, you don't have to do this. I was just going through with it for my brothers. If we get caught, we're gonna be in deep shit. Yeah, it's exactly why I wanna do it. And besides, we all have to live a little, right? Touche. Mabry. Why do you always have your nose in that witchy book? It doesn't hurt to be prepared. Prepared for what? What are we fighting now? Werewolves? Vampires? Wee little leprechauns? Have you forgotten what tonight is? No, I haven't forgotten. This is how I deal with things, Mabry, with my unbridled charm and wit. - [Mabry] And wit. - And wit. Wit, Maybry, wit. I'm gonna go back in the back and repackage some shrunken heads. - You do that, please. - Get drunk. You're just upset that I got the looks in the family. That's all. Yeah, crushed over it. (door closing) You seriously didn't have to do this. It's probably one of these stupidest- No. I wanted to. Plus it gives me a chance to apologize for earlier. So why are you? What? You know. I'm just curious what you see in a guy like Billy. I mean, it's not like we're engaged or anything. I'm technically not even dating officially. I mean, Billy's a jerk, but he can be sweet. Billy Masterson's sweet? Yeah. It sounds crazy. But I mean, it's true. I mean, no one else has really shown any interest. Right. [Benny] I, I don't think we should be doing this, Stokes. Dude, put your big boy pants on and take off your diaper. (Benny sighing) (sign clattering) What is wrong with you? Stop it! - [Benny] Sorry. - [Stokely] Mmm! (bust thudding) Oh my god, Miah! Are you okay? All right over there, Sanders? Ah, gee, Mr. King, we are so sorry. I guess Miah here wasn't paying attention to the signs. Signs? There were signs? (soft dramatic music) Come on. Let's go. It's all right. I'll go get you a band aid or something. No! No. It's just a scratch! Right, Miah? Right, Miah? Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Mmm-hmm. So sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. King. (soft suspenseful music) [Stokely] Hell and yes, we pulled it off! (Miah exhaling) Are you sure you're okay? I mean, they were about to get caught. It's the only thing I could think of. No harm, no foul, right? All right, we helped your little dweeb friends. Can we go now? - Yeah, just a second. I'm gonna call Jared. Have him come get us, okay? Okay. Do that. Cammy, are you kidding me? [Cammy] I'm right behind you. Damn! Call me later. [Paris] Piss off, Stokely. So now that you have the board, what do you plan to do with it? Figure out what it does, obviously. Do you wanna come? It would be wrong not to include you since you kind of made this all possible. Yeah. Hell yeah, I wanna come. I just gotta catch up to Paris and calm her down, but what time and where? The fork, 9:00pm. It's right up the street from our house. Cool. Yeah, I'll see you guys there. Maybe we could hang at your place afterwards? Okay. Sure. Okay. Don't start to party without me. Dude, I sense an ulterior motive here. (hand thumping) There. I restocked the holy water. I did not pee in it this time. I actually got it from the church. They tried to make me pay for it. So I ran, broke the glass. Sorry. [Mabry] Have you seen my book? Yeah, like every day for the past 30 years. Here's a better question. Did you eat? Did you sleep? I'm serious, Parker. It was just here. You're like this every year. And you know what? Now you're upsetting Pickles. So, you're fine. I'm fine. Pickles is fine. We're all fine! (soft eerie music) [Stokely] Hey, we should get started, bro. It's getting pretty late. It's not nine yet. She still has time. Okay. (soft eerie music) Hey. Sorry that took me so long. This is really out here. Yeah, it is way out. Yeah, I didn't want you to think I was like standing you up or something. No, no, no. It's totally fine. Yeah. Glad you're here. Let's get started, eh? Chop, chop. Bah! (laughing) Sorry, I was to lighten the mood. (soft eerie music) What's the hold up, numb nuts? Will you shut up? I'm trying to make sure I do this right. Doesn't really come with an instruction manual. I'm kind of making it up as I go. What if we all put our hands on it? Like, like a ouija board, you know? Worth a shot. Oh, shit. It glows? (board humming) Do you guys feel that? Wha, what's it doin', Stokes? How am I supposed know, man? (creepy suspenseful music) Oh, here are the words. (Miah speaking in ancient language) [Benny] Wait! Someone do something! Miah! Miah! Snap out of it! (Miah speaking in ancient language) [Cammy] Miah! Miah! Miah! [Cammy] What's happening? Miah! Miah! (Miah speaking in ancient language) Miah! (Miah speaking in ancient language) (intense dramatic music) Oh, no, no. Is he dead? Is he dead? I mean, it looks like it. Miah? Are you okay? Think so. What just happened? You good, B? I'm good. You? Yeah, I think I'm fine. You gotta be kiddin' me. Cool. The board sends assholes. Paris told me that you've been super friendly to this little sack of shit! I mean, it's almost like you're fond of him. Had to find out for myself and I come here see you all cut up in the woods playin' some fuckin' board game? - Billy, seriously. - No, no, no. Stop! Shh! No! Don't say anything more to me, you little slut. (punch smacking) Oh ho! Shit! Nice hit, little spitfire. (punch smacking) Miah! (Miah coughing) I want you to know somethin'. I really want you to use your imagination when I tell you this. Your hand? It's most definitely not the first thing that she's put her lips on. (kick thudding) - Oh! (Miah coughing) Come on. Billy, you asshole! Whatever, bitch. Oh, shit. Do you even know how to use that thing? Only one way to find out. (gun cocking) Of course he doesn't. Now, piss off. Come on. Let's just go, babe. You're dead, little boy. (gun firing) You got brass balls, kid. Bigger than your brother's. Benny. Benny, give me the gun. - Ben. - Benny! It's all right. Let's go. (crickets chirping) What the hell are those pussies doing, huh? Fuckin' some ghost or something? I just can't believe Cammy. I mean, do you think she's at his house right now? Nobody screws me like that and lives to talk about it. Just forget 'em, all right? She chose them and not us. I wonder what Steve's doing right now. He's probably in the fucking car masturbating his little dick. Hey, we're about to go up there. We're gonna teach these little pansies a lesson. (creepy suspenseful music) What's this twinker doin'? I don't know. What is she doin'? She's standin' there. (creepy suspenseful music) Hey, asshole! I don't have time for this shit! Billy, over here. (creepy suspenseful music) [Billy] What the fuck is this? (creepy suspenseful music) Oh, no. (Paris screaming) (flesh squelching) (creepy dramatic music) (soft suspenseful piano music) (door creaking) (board thudding) [Miah] Slow, slow. (Miah breathing jaggedly) Should we call Mom? No, Benny, we shouldn't call Mom. Use your fucking head. I'm sorry. Another stupid idea on a day full of stupid ideas. I- I mean, what were you thinking? A gun? Seriously? Where did you find it? Mom keeps her guns in the barn so I won't find them. Yeah, stupid. Well, I'm sorry for saving your ass! You could've killed someone! (door slamming) Oh, hey, at least we still got the board. Enough with the board, Stokely! - Just calm down. - Miah. No, stop. Just let me. (door slamming) Miah. (soft synth music) (water splashing) (soft synth music) (water splashing) (soft synth music) Miah. I'm so sick of that asshole. Why won't he just leave us alone? It's my fault. None of this would've happened- No. No, it's not. He shouldn't have said any of that shit about you. (soft synth music) How bad is it? I'm fine. Let me see. (Miah sighing) Oh, he really did a number on you. I feel awful. I guess I just wanted to see you again. (soft synth music) (footsteps approaching) (curtain rattling) Here's Stokely! Seriously? Fine. I had to. How you doin'? [Benny] I'm fine. Miah may have thought you made a mistake, but, uh, I think you're just a regular bad ass. Yeah, right. No, seriously. Balls of steel, little bro. And here I thought they hadn't even dropped yet. Shut up. Hey, want some Nancy Summer shit? You gonna make me cover my eyes? Nah, I think you deserve somethin'. Come on. So, uh, board thing was kinda cool, right? (Benny scoffing) Yeah. (soft synth music) All right, got the chains. I'm gonna pick up some grub. What do ya want? Why don't you swing by Brady's and get us some Jungle Juice? I like where your head is at. Nothin' I like more on this holiday than I hate other than to be drunk. (Mabry chuckling) (door closing) (unsettling eerie music) (boxes clattering) (intense dramatic music) (Mabry grunting) Oh! (Mabry thudding) (intense dramatic music) You picked the wrong fight, Pinocchio! (intense dramatic music) (vase shattering) (tense suspenseful music) (demon gurgling) You all right there, buddy? (demon gurgling) (blood splattering) (demon thudding) (partner giggling) I'm drunk. Yeah, you are. (kisses smacking) No better place than here. On this dirty side of the road? You love it when I play dirty. I don't know. It's creepy. And it's Halloween. Come on, babe. I wanna stab you with my pitchfork. (partner giggling) Come on. (unsettling eerie music) (intense dramatic music) (ax thudding) (blood splattering) (intense dramatic music) What did you break? Oh, shit. The board. (containers clattering) Dammit! (mid-tempo rock music) You are so beautiful. (mid-tempo rock music) (knuckles rapping) (mid-tempo rock music) (knuckles rapping) Sorry, sorry. It's really late. Yeah, I really hope it's not my mom. (tense suspenseful music) (flames crackling) Shit! (kick thudding) [Cammy] Oh my god. Whoa. What the hell? No fucking clue. (tense suspenseful music) (door creaking) Look, look. Yeah! (Stokely clapping) (demon breathing heavily) Thanks. So, what do you wanna do? Haven't shown you my room yet. No, you haven't. I got a pretty big bed. (Cammy chuckling) Well, that's good, I suppose. (knuckles rapping) (tense suspenseful music) What the hell is that? Miah. (door creaking) Hello? Hello? All right, whoever's out here, could you please not be? That'd be great. (footsteps crunching) I'm callin' the cops! (door slamming) Guys, what's goin' on? Jesus. Billy and his goons are back. Great. Is anyone else's phone connected to the WiFi? Mine says disconnected. Mine, too. There's no service this far out without WiFi. (loud thudding) Jesus, I'm so fucking sick of that. (soft suspenseful music) (loud thudding) (Cammy gasping) Shit, shit, shit, shit. (tense suspenseful music) Billy? I'll handle this. I don't think that's a good idea. I'm not afraid of them. All right, fine. I'll go with you. No, you're in absolutely no shape to. Just stay here with your brothers. No, I'm fine! [Cammy] Miah, I'm serious. What if they hurt you? He's not gonna hurt me. Wait. It's dangerous to go alone. Take this. Don't worry. I got this. Seriously, guys? (tense suspenseful music) All right, Billy. You've had your fun. Now grow the hell up and go home. Hey, hey. Did you seal the deal? What do you mean, Stokely? Did you seal the deal? No, we just made out. Do you feel like you would've sealed the deal- All right, will you shut up, please? I'm just saying. I mean, seriously! I don't know what your issue is. You beat up Miah. You go get these costumes and come back here? For what? And Paris. I guess I expected more of you having been my friend forever, but I guess you're just as bad as these two lowlifes. I wonder what she's saying to them. Who knows? That was super hot though how she stormed outside with the bat. I'm getting serious Sarah Connor vibes from her. Who's Sarah Connor? Dude! I mean, come on, you guys. You can cut the shit and take the stupid masks off. (Samael laughing maniacally) (Samael humming) No, dear. It's anything but pointless. You have something of mine. I'm here to collect. You're not... Paris? Oh. Oh, I see you two know each other. (laughing maniacally) (knife slicing) Cammy. [Stokely] Shit! (blood gurgling) (Cammy coughing) (Samael laughing maniacally) Help! Help me! Please! Please! God, I'm bleeding! What did I do to him! Please! No! Please! I can't! What the fuck? Hey, Cammy, Cammy, Cammy. (Cammy coughing) (dark piano music) So tragic. Miah! Miah! Come on, we gotta go. Let's go! (tense suspenseful music) Gentlemen! You summoned us. Here we are. Holy shit, holy shit, holy fucking shit! We're so fucking dead! [Benny] I don't see them! [Stokely] Shit. Where'd they go? C-Cammy? Miah. Miah, what are we gonna do? He's cracked, Stokes. Miah, did you lock the back door when you came back in? (Miah crying) Shit! Fuck. (loud thudding) Not cool! No! Stop it! This isn't happening. This isn't fucking happening. [Miah] They killed her. Was it Billy? Dammit, Miah, was it Billy? No, no, no. Billy, Billy was dead. What? (soft eerie music) (flame whooshing) (fire crackling) (water splashing) So this isn't Billy and his goons? No. It's the board. Enough with the board. No, he's right. I can't explain it, but something happened tonight, Miah, and you know it. Can we please focus on getting out of here? How are we supposed to do that, Einstein? What about our bikes? We'll never make it on our bikes. But Cammy drove here. Her car's parked out back. If we can make it to her car, we can get the hell out of here. What about her keys? (keys jangling) Do we just leave her body? You're gonna pack the car, Benny? 'Cause I'm not. We can't. Our only problem is gonna be making sure we get out of here without running into them. I only saw three. Could there be more? You're forgetting about the one not in the mask. So, four. But how do we know there's not more out there? And who's the creepy Elvira chick? No idea, but we can't stay and find out. Come on. We're so screwed. (covert synth music) (Stokely whispering) Shut up. (covert synth music) (demon screeching) (shrubbery rustling) (tense suspenseful music) (footsteps crunching) (unsettling eerie music) (demon screeching) (unsettling eerie music) (door rattling) Come on, come on. (door rattling) Pull the trigger, Miah. Now would be a good time to kill that. Like now. Should've done it like 10 seconds ago, but you've still got redemption time. Stop it for one second in your life. Shut up. - Shoot it. (door rattling) Okay, we're out of the barn. (tense suspenseful music) (Miah thudding) (ax thudding) (Miah screaming) No! (bat thudding) (Miah coughing) You do it. (gun firing) Back off, slip knot. (intense dramatic music) Should've stayed down, clown. (gun firing) (Miah coughing) You, you have no idea what you've done! Get your asses up and back in that house now before another one of those things shows up. Come on! Nice shot. I am to please. Can we quit clownin' around now? Clownin', right, 'cause it's a clown. (demon screeching) We got a ghoulie at 12 o'clock. Like my 12 or your 12? 'Cause this is my 12. That's your 12. Who cares? He's right there. Yeah, okay. You know what? You get that one. I'll get the next one. I'm gonna get the next one. It's like last time, right? Yeah, I was, I was seven. Yeah, unfortunately, like the last time. - Okay, move, move. - [Parker] Get set. Move, move! (tense suspenseful music) (door creaking) Look, Mabry, I can explain. I don't want any of this- (punch thudding) What the hell? Sit down, good hair. You three have royally screwed up. You don't know what you're dealing with out there. Okay, what are we dealing with? There's a reason that this board wasn't for sale! The board? Yes, the board. It works like a key. A gateway to the other dimensions. Those things out there, you summoned. Wait. Things? I mean, not like humans. More like demons or tortured souls connected to the board. He calls 'em ghoulies. Like the movie? Yes? Well, what about the creepy, semi-attractive lady killer with the rack? Samael. A dark necromancer. She feeds on innocence. Oh. How exactly do the off-brand Winchesters know all this? Because when we were young and stupid, we used the board. And those things came for us, and they took our friends and they almost got us, too, but I managed to close the gate. But it screwed us up for life. Especially Parker. (chuckling) That much is obvious. Oh, you're a little twat, aren't ya? Eh. I'm gonna shoot 'em. I'm gonna, right in the foot. What I was able to learn, and it's not much, is they can only be summoned on Halloween. And they use that to hide what they really are. For what? Do you listen to nothing that I say? Halloween. It's the one time of year that the veil between the dimensions is the thinnest. You screw with the darkness and it tends to screw back, without a happy ending. Now. One of those things attacked me at my shop earlier, so we don't know how many of those are out there. But as long as the gate is open, they're gonna keep coming through. It's gonna keep getting worse. So how do we close it? It's more like how do you three close it, or whichever one of you recited the incantation. (Stokely sighing) (Miah sighing) (unsettling eerie music) (creepy dramatic organ music) (demons screeching) I don't like the sound of that. Here's the thing about fear. It seasons the meat. From all the way out here I can smell it pulsing through your veins, and I can't wait to feast on your putrid, innocent flesh. Especially you! ♪ Benny boy, Benny boy ♪ How does she know my name? Jeremiah! What say you and I make a deal, a bargain. Quid pro quo, tit for tat. You give me your brother and I'll let you live. (soft eerie music) Humans. They always do everything the hard way. My friends, the stage is yours. (unsettling eerie music) Oh, no, no, no. This is not good. What are we gonna do? We gotta go. Basement. Get your asses downstairs now! [Stokely] Goodbye! I'm out of here! (gun cocking) (loud thudding) [Parker] Gotta get out of here. Is there a way out? Hey, snap out of it. Is there a way out of here? Yeah, go this way. Come on. [Parker] Go. (tense dramatic music) Get the next one. (gun firing) (tense dramatic music) Oh now! What and call me a biscuit. If it isn't the little King boys. You're grown up, I see. Hi, boys. Samael. You haven't changed at all. Still a soul-suckin', Hot Topic, Stevie Nicks out of hell's trailer park. Would love to stay and catch up, but we've got shit to do, so. (kiss smacking) Get in. And you watch my seats! [Parker] Go, go, go, go, go! [Samael] Old friends, all those years ago. (engine cranking) Hey, why does this always happen in this situation? Always? She's been through a lot, smart mouth. Give her a break. Dude, those things are gonna give us a break, okay? Hey, let's go. We need to leave, dude, now. Okay, baby, just now start. Now is a great time. [Mabry] Start the car, start the car. [Stokely] Yeah, hey, we need to go. Whoa! Oh! - [Parker] Mabry. - I'm trying! Shit! Come on! [Parker] He's right there. Come on, come on! Dammit! Hit the gas and run her over! Now! We'll stall 'em. [Parker] Tell me you're not thinkin' what I'm thinkin'. (Mabry exhaling) Go, go, go! Run. Run! All right, one of you maggots do something to my car. (Samael laughing) This is gonna be so much fun. (Mabry imitating Samael laughing) Not as much fun as sending you back into your little hellhole. Mabry, Mabry, Mabry. You have always had a such a limited imagination. How? It's a kiddie pool. It's a baby step to where we're from. Now, I congratulate you. I do. All those years ago, you won. You shut the door. Yeah, I did. That's not happening tonight. I will have those kids. I'm so sorry you won't be alive to see it. Maybe not. But. (canister popping) (smoke hissing) (engine rumbling) (eerie organ music) Follow the idiots. (demon screeching) Julian Jitters. (eerie organ music) The kids have opened the book, but they got away. Every moment they live we are at risk. Don't let history repeat itself. (eerie organ music) Okay, so now that the dude came to save us, he's probably worm food. We need to find some help. What about Mom? Hey, this is Ellie Sanders. I'm sorry I'm over the Atlantic right now. I can't take your call- The sheriff's station. It's about 15-20 minutes that way, if we're lucky. [Benny] Guys. (tense suspenseful music) (intense creepy music) All right. I don't want to be a negative Nancy or anything, but we kind of suck at rescue missions. We kick ass at rescue missions. We suck at babysitting. Fine. Game plan? We find the Three Stooges and close the gate. Right now I need something sweet. My sugar's crashin'. Excellent. I am parched. Please go inside. Exactly, exactly what happened. Trick or treat, boys. Can we help you? I need 20 in gas and, um. [Reporter] Hello, everyone. This is Channel 7 news, where the news matters. You feel all right, fellas? You're lookin' a little green around the gills. You guys seen three teenagers come in here? Lanky, long-haired chick-lookin' dudes. Real mouthy. Besides, the teenagers hang here all night. Amateur night. It's good to see the kids enjoying this time of year. You know, things were a little sketchy there for awhile with that trunk or treating. Kids walking around the gym pickin' out candy instead of trick or treating. Stupid shit. Stupid shit. Breaks my heart driving down the street. No children out. Bunch of fuckin' uptight assholes sayin' it's not safe for the kids to be out anymore. She's definitely got a point. - Hey. - Sorry. What? What, no, I'm just saying every Halloween, trick or treat, monster mash, all that stuff. Can we go now, please? Hey, thought you looked familiar. You own that oddity shop in town, don't ya? Yeah, that's me. Got any of them back scratchers made from alligator claws? Always wanted one of those. No. You two come with someone? You have a gun back there, old man? Gun? What on earth for? 'Cause you're gonna need it. Need it for what? You'll see. Come on. Stay here, Janie. Let me go out an see what's. What are we doin'? (tense suspenseful music) Oh, probably nothin', huh? [Mabry] Stay sharp, all right? What in the hell is goin' on here? (tense suspenseful music) (metal clanging loudly) Oh! You wanna? I'll go. Yup. (tense suspenseful music) Whah-ha! Okay. We're good? We're good. That's good. You're fine? You okay? - Y'all find everything? - [Group] Ah! (guns firing) (blood splattering) You shot Greg! Shit. (Janie screaming) - Janie! Sorry, Greg. What are you? What are you, fuckle head? Huh? What are you? I've killed bigger rats in Brooklyn than you. I buried three husbands, you think I'm afr... Fuck you and your mother! Ah! (flesh squelching) Janie. (intense dramatic music) Ah! Ah! (kicks thudding) (head squelching) (gun firing) I had him. (Miah and Stokely gasping) Dude, I gotta take a break for a second. Call our mother or somethin'. My lungs feel like I got Covid again. We are so dead, so dead. All right, let's take a break. Try to get on the platform. If you see anyone, yell. Miah, you heard Mabry. You're the only one who can close that gate. Can't close the gate, Stokely, without the board. Mabry had it in his bag and he- Yeah, why didn't you grab it, man? Seriously? None of this shit would've happened had you not stolen the board in the first place. Yeah, well, I'm sorry. I'm not the one who went all Hogwarts spell casting and opened the gate to hell world. You're such a fucking skeez! Really, Miah? Oh, you're gonna get all... (Benny screaming) (intense dramatic music) (bat thudding) (Benny screaming) - [Stokely] Miah, hit it! (Benny screaming) (demon screeching) (unsettling eerie music) Shit. It's locked. What are we gonna do? (Miah talking indistinctly) Let's go around the back, come on. (officers talking indistinctly) Hey, officers, officers. We need your help. These, uh, these things are after us. All right, all right, is this some sort of prank or something, 'cause we've had enough of that tonight. No, no, this is definitely not a prank. People have been killed, mutilated. We really need your help. All right, all right, all right. Let's just calm down, okay? What do these guys look like? [Benny] They're not people. They're wearing masks. Costumes. And so is everybody else tonight. Like, we just can't go around arresting and talking to everybody wearing a mask. You know it's Halloween, right? Okay, look. Why don't you guys just go on in. We'll get a statement and we'll get this written down. [Stokely] A fucking statement? Yes. Oh, shit. It's too late. Come on, come on, come on. Calm down now. (intense dramatic music) - [Cop] Hey. - [Cop] Whoa-ho-ho. [Cop] We said stop right there. All right? I wouldn't, I swear to God I wouldn't do that. (guns firing) (cops screaming) [Miah] Come on, let's get some help. Ah, why didn't I get an invite? (upbeat hard rock music) - Hey, hey. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This just will not do. Everyone is supposed to be in costume. Wait, don't tell me. Oh my god, Stefan just walked in. Is he looking? Is he looking? Don't look! Don't look! Is he looking? Is he looking? 'Cause he so wants to get with this. Oh my god, Stefan! It's Stefan. I gotta go. TTFN. Ta ta for now. What the hell was that? No idea. You look like a good time. You smell like booze and bad decisions. Maybe a tad. So what do you say? You wanna unwrap that Clark Bar and put it in my candy bowl? Oh. Nope. Can't say I do. (Benny coughing) I just threw up a little in my mouth. (coughing) (upbeat hard rock music) (demons screeching) (balloon popping) (upbeat hard rock music) (knife slashing) (partygoers screaming) (ax thudding) (blood splattering) (partygoer screaming) (spear thudding) (blood splattering) (partygoer screaming) (blood splattering) (partygoer screaming) (upbeat hard rock music) (ax thudding) (partygoer screaming) Best party ever. Shit! We're trapped. Dammit! Can't catch a break! Oh, before we die, can I just say I don't wanna die a virgin? Chill out, Stokely. No one's dying. Benny, stick behind us. - Okay. (demon screeching) For Narnia! (bat thudding) Oh, shit! (bat thudding) Miah! (intense dramatic music) Batter up. (bat thudding) (demon screeching) [Benny] Holy shit! I give it a two out of four. [Miah] What the hell are you talkin' about? I cut his head clean off! I mean, the one-liner needed a little bit of work. Like, welcome to my world, bitch. Like "Freddy Vs. Jason." You know? (intense dramatic music) [Benny] Miah! (bat thudding) (Miah grunting) (bat thudding) (punch smacking) Stokely! (Benny grunting) (intense dramatic music) (nails slicing) (Benny screaming) (intense dramatic music) Oh. Shh. Shh. This one, uh, this one looks tasty. (Benny panic breathing) Benny. Take me. Benny. Happy Halloween. No, no, no! Miah! Please! (soft eerie music) (Stokely coughing) (Stokely spitting) (Stokely grunting) Miah. Miah! Miah! Miah. Hey, hey! Where's Benny? They took him. They took him. Let's go get him. (Miah grunting) (sirens wailing) (engine revving) You two look like shit. Get in the car. (engine rumbling) (soft eerie music) We thought you were already dead. So did we. I have to get to Benny. [Mabry] And close the gate. Okay, sure. But first Ben. I hate to level it with you, Sanders, but you need to accept the fact that your brother is probably already gone. Don't say that. Like there was already a good chance you were already dead, too. - That's different. - [Stokely] How? Because I'm kind of a badass, all right? This whole monster hunting thing? It's sort of my jam, okay? Now I hate to piss in your Cheerios, but the truth is, there's a very real chance that your brother is gone, just like our friends. [Miah] What are you saying? I'm saying that there is a chance that your- Okay, well don't say it. Stop fucking say that! You wanna get pushy with me, kid? I am not in the mood to take your- Screw you, Mabry! You listen to me, kid! Whose fault is this, huh? Who opened the gate? You! You did! All right, I am out here trying to save your skinny ass. You've got spunk, I'll give you that, but you're gonna need it 'cause those things out there, they're gonna chew you up and spit you out if you're not prepared! Okay. (Miah crying) I'm sorry, kid. I really am. This is the price we pay for messin' with that board. You opened Pandora's box. You thought you were just gonna walk away free. There's still time. Wait. You and your brother managed to escape, so. Yeah. Barely. We barely got out of the pit before lady death pulled me down into the abyss, but he closed the portal. Yeah, but she didn't. He saved you. He did. [Stokely] So that means we can still save Ben. Maybe, maybe not. Either way, that portal has to be closed. Mabry, we can still save him. I made a promise to protect my brothers, and I didn't. I fucking failed. I will help you end this, but Benny is my top priority. Please help me save him! (soft synth music) We don't have much time. All right, we've killed a lot of those things, but as long as the gate's open. (Miah crying) That's too much, princess. Too much. Thought it was cute. Well, can't go into battle empty-handed. Great. All right. So where did you happy mills mess with the board? Indian Fork Park. Let's end this. Hell, yeah! I'm gonna shoot that one. (tense dramatic music) (Benny grunting) You look terrified. You should be. [Benny] What do you plan to do with me? Oh, just drain you of your essence, indulge ourselves on your innocence. [Benny] Lady, in English. We're going to eat you. It's gonna hurt. This night never would've happened if you hadn't come. Yo, Elvira! Fancy meeting you here, eh? Did you really think you can save your little brother? You know, today has probably been the worst Halloween of my life. First, I make the grave mistake of messing with that board, which causes all this. And now I had to kill them. And now I smell like roadkill. And now I gotta kick you in your lady parts, get a Xanax, and definitely a therapist. - Little boy. - Little? (Stokely laughing) Please. Nothing on me is little. My pirate name is Long Dong Silver, bitch. Kill the noisy one. Please. Do you do everything Hagzilla tells you to? She probably keeps your balls in a jar on her nightstand. (soft dramatic music) Guys. Guys. What's the safe word? (shovel thudding) (intense dramatic music) (bat thudding) (Stokely grunting) (intense dramatic music) (kick thudding) Demons cannot own us. (bat thudding) (knife slicing) (Stokely grunting) (intense dramatic music) All who oppose me die by my hand. (Mabry grunting) Keep sweet talkin' me, lady. (Miah grunting) (punch smacking) (gun cocking) (gun firing) Only I get to kill that one. (gun firing) (demon thudding) (punch smacking) (shovel thwacking) (soft eerie music) Welcome to my world, witch. (spear thudding) (blood splattering) I get to go kill your brother. (Mabry grunting) Oh, shit. Holy shit! Oh, shit! (Mabry gasping) No! (gasping) Mabry. (bones crunching) - No! No! (solemn piano music) (Mabry gasping) (soft solemn music) Oh, no. (Benny grunting) [Miah] Benny? No! Ah, no! You little! Ah! Mabry, Mabry, she's in! How do I close it? The passage. Recite the passage three times. (Miah speaking in ancient language) (Samael grunting) - [Stokely] Miah! (tense dramatic music) (Miah speaking in ancient language) (tense dramatic music) Mabry! We gotta open it. Open the gate! We gotta get him back! Please. I'm sorry, kid. Mabry, open the fucking gate! We can't. (Stokely crying) If we open the gate back up, they come back through, and it all starts over again. I'm sorry, kid. (dark solemn music) I am so sorry. Please. (sobbing) (dark solemn music) (soft piano music) (soft piano music continues) (Stokely sniffling) I'll fix this, Miah. (Stokely sniffling) (soft piano music) [Benny] When you're a kid, Halloween is about dressing up in costumes, getting candy, pulling pranks, celebrating the spooky. You think that the scary stuff around you is all for fun and nothing can harm you. A year ago we learned the reality is that's not true. Happy Halloween. [Speaker] Oh, Mother Ferris, not again. (upbeat techno rock music)
