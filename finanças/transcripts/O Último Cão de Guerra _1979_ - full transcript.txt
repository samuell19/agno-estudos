And so, we expect for the success to be absolute. Very well, very well. Dr., were the tests satisfactory? Yes, my General. Right color of blood, perfect muscles and skeletal system strong as wood. What about the parents? These children are the product of a very carefully studied crossing. I think we're reaching our desired goal. The parents have an IQ between 100 and 120. According to our research, will result in a perfect mental development. Do you need any other explanations, my General? No. Excellent! We're about to witness the breeding of a perfect race. A race that will dominate the world of tomorrow. This will be a victory for The Cause, my General. Soldiers... Attention! Present... arms! The troop is ready, my General. Have you changed your mind? Hit him! Enough! These are among the best, my General. I hope so. After these women go through the disinfection process Submit them to thorough examination. -Yes, sir! How's the security division? No espionage threats? Absolutely, my General. Could the parents of these women represent any trouble for us? What would you do if your daughter was here, my General? -Nothing. -That's true. I wouldn't try anything. They won't either. Watch... Everything within a 10 KM. radius is under my control, my General. All the area is mined, there's no way in or out. In any case, it's always a good thing to perform a display of power and force. I will do that today, my General. You will patrol Sector 6. Who will be in this area? Sergeant? At your command, Lieutenant! You! Take your patrol and come with me. And bring that girl. Yes, sir. You! Quick, to the truck! Come on, hurry up! -So, how is it? -Reasonable. The General wants the results right away. -I'll finish here and take them to the lab. -Very well. Don't worry, he will come. When I call, he comes running. He knows I pay well. He's already been under my command in several tough missions. But this time, it will be the most dangerous one. Are you questioning my abilities? Did you call me just to offend me? No, it's not that. It's just that we're in such a hopeless situation that we can't expect much from anybody. Don't be such a coward! You pay us, and we take care of everything else. They'll come from heaven in chariots of fire. What? What did she say? She's been this since she returned from there. The important thing is that we must do something to rescue our daughters from the hands of those demons. Wait a minute, wait a minute. There's one thing I don't understand. What to they do to them to leave them like this? They use them for reproduction. They have this crazy idea about creating a pure race and who knows what else. Some guy had that idea, and because of it, he almost sets the world on fire. Hitler. Adolph Hitler. Yeah, that motherfucker! I will talk to Jo this very day. Hurry up! The soldiers are moving! Let's go! -Watch out! -Are you nuts? Look! I recognize that degenerate! Jo will be glad to know he's involved in this. That's the Lieutenant. He's the right hand of that crazy General. He's one huge son of a bitch Good morning, Osiris. I thought you would be missing your daughter. So I brought her. She's a wonderful girl. She's was very collaborative with The Cause. She gave us a beautiful child. Congratulations, Osiris. Wasn't the other one enough? You had to take her too? But she was sterile, Osiris. A defective woman. That's why we won't return her. She wasn't worth being your daughter. Isn't enough what you've already done? Leave my daughter here and go away. I can't. She will remain with us until I see your heart is with The Cause. You could take a position that would be detrimental for us. I won't do any of that! I don't really trust you, Osiris. Do you know why? You're not one to walk away with the tail between your legs. You must be planning some sort of revenge. I would advice not to do that, because you would force me to execute your daughter. And that would be unfortunate, because you gave two daughters to The Cause. I think we better leave. It's been over an hour. Didn't I tell you? It's very dangerous to be out here. What do you think about this? I don't care either way. Hey, do you see anybody? Are you gonna start doubting me? If I say he's coming is because he's coming. I know Jo very well. He'll show up over there. How will he show up? Don't ask stupid questions. He'll show up in a bike, in a plane, in a boat, on foot... If I say he'll come, he'll come. Stop busting my balls. Alright, we won't argue anymore. We're wait another half hour. If he doesn't show up, our business is over. Hold this. What's that? Soldiers? It's Jo! Didn't I tell you, fools? Didn't I'll tell you he'd come? Who's the boss around here? Move, I'm gonna jump. It's been a long time... You're not an easy man to find. Where did you get that steel mosquito from? You talked to me about a revolution. Where is it? Calm down, Jo. Manners come first. I want to introduce you to some friends. That's Osiris, that one is Ramirez and this is Beto. And that one is... well, it's a client of ours. Alright, alright... but what do they have to do with me? That's what I was trying to explain. They are the party's patrons. Party, huh? I don't know what kind of deal that guy made with you but I want to let you know he's one of the biggest liars on the face of the Earth.. What are you trying to do here? How long have you been working with me? 10 years I've been putting up with you. And have I ever lied to you? Yes, you've been lying to me for 12 years. Didn't I tell you? One of these days I'm gonna loose my cool and I'll kill him! Calm down. This argument won't take us anywhere. Let's get to the point. And what is the point? This is what's happening: We're in a very difficult situation, and that's why we called you. You... Don't you hear me calling you? Please, my cigarrette fell. Dirty and damaged nails. That doesn't look good. My room is at your disposal. What do you say? Put her in the cage! Leave her there to rot! That was really stupid of her. Why stupid? That lieutenant is a bastard. Mon amour, that kind of torture won't get us anywhere. Are you holding in contempt an order from our General? Pardon, cherie. I didn't make myself clear. What I meant is that the General won't get anything from it. This kind of torture won't give us anything. That's none of your business. We are The Cause. And you know that. But mon amour, our General must know that the human body can't bear that kind of punishment. It's certain death. That's exactly what the General wants to know. How many minutes the human body can resist the pain. Isn't that important? Come. What are you gonna do with me? Blood tests for emergencies. Your blood is very special. Rare. And we need it, urgently. I am afraid! There's nothing to fear. It won't hurt. You will be released after this. Will I be able to go home? Of course! Excuse me, my General. Yes? This is the girl for the test. Very well, you can take her in. With your permission. Those men are crazy. Don't say that, mom. You're a part of The Cause. Didn't you know what it was all about? Even you are contaminated by their madness! Killing another human being? Why? To build a better world! There's no victory without sacrifice. If he says that's how it is, that's the way it's gotta be. We can't call the police or use any legal means. That crazy General would know we're the ones behind it. They would kill our daughters. And you, as unknown civilians, won't raise any suspicions. I need a stronger motive, or I won't go. And if that idiot Gato promised you anything, he can do it himself. I'm sorry, but I'm out. That's not what we agreed upon. You told me you were his boss! What do you want me to do? He went crazy! Gato, he's leaving! Do something! Hey, Jo! Wait a minute! Do you know whos involved in this? Asparagus! Did you say Asparagus? Yeah, that motherfucker! Alright, I'm in! How are we gonna do it? Where is this place? I'll take you there. Please, bring back my daughter! What are you gonna do? I will talk to the Lieutenant. -Talk about what? -I'm gonna make him a proposition. -What? -Just leave it to me. We're witnesses to the experience dreamed by the great dictator, Adolph Hitler! How many minutes can the human body resist pain? General, if the results are succesful we will have reached our goal. The subjects generated according to our plans will endure any kind of physical punishment in case they're ever taken as prisoners. They'll be useful in cases of espionage and counter espionage. Among other things, young girl. Begin! Three minutes and a half. That's too little time. I'm not pleased! Get another one ready! Very well, we're alone. What is this all about? I want to do an exchange. As far as I know, the conditions around here are dictated by the General, or me. But never by a prisoner. But there are things that are of interest for both parts. Maybe. And what's your proposal? I've got a woman to offer you. Oh, that! Now stop bluffing. Show your cards! I'll stay with you and will do anything you want. You better think about it. Maybe I'd want something you won't. I don't know what you'll want, but I'll want it too. And what do you want in return? I'd like you to free the girl that you caged out there. The gypsy. Sgt. Medina! Yes, sir! -Release the gypsy girl from the cage! -Yes, sir! Stop walking around, you fool! Don't talk to her like that! Can't you see she's not well? There's one thing I don't understand. If that general thinks we're not good for procreation why won't he let us go? Do you really wonder about that? Shut your mouths! We already called lights out! Didn't you hear? One more word and I'll send everybodyto the cage. Kid, you're just getting started. You don't know anything yet. You know what this reminds me of? Our Vietnam mission. Hey Jo, do you remember our mission in Vietnam? I don't remember anything. You're a fucking liar. Didn't I save you from those yellow bastards? That's just bullshit. And keep it down! See, kid? How can I work with a neurotic motherfucker like this one, huh? Just forget about it. As I was saying... There was more than 50 japanese... But there aren't any japanese in Vietnam, Gato. They're all the same anyway. with those slant eyes. And with this very same machine gun... Shut up! There, on the ground! I can't see anything. Get down. Hey, Jo! Do you know what this reminds me of? Shut up! This is too dangerous. We will rest here. Let's wait until sunrise. Gato, first watch is yours. Are you gonna start it with me? Just go! What? You took an oath! You can't change your mind like this. The Cause needs you! Then you can't keep killing people like this. So you killed that woman on purpose, mom? I did what any human would've done. She didn't die because of the surgery she died from an overdose of painkillers I gave her. You mean you sabotaged my General's experiment? Exactly. Now I understand. Zogue was right. The human body can last for more than three and a half minutes . And you have the nerve to ruin everything! And I will do it as many times as necessary. She died anyway, but at least I saved her from the pain of the test. I'm sorry, mom, but you've lost your mind. You're forcing me to take measures I didn't want to take. You are under arrest, in the name of The Cause. You have the courage to do such a thing, my child? It's for your own good. You know you could get executed for this? But I'll talk with General Zogue. He'll prevent the execution. Goodbye, mother. Child, child! Come back here! Our next goal will be infiltration in all of Latin America. -I want well trained men. -It will be done, sir. The third stage will be the conquering of Australia, and all of Africa. Europe is of no interest to us. It's in a state of physical and mental decay. The Cause is being succesful so far. The level of dedication from the subjects is absolute. Excuse me, my General but I have doubts about the resistance tests. I thought my colleague, Dr. Nicole was indecisive while performing the surgery. Dr., opinions without proof to support them can entail discipline problems. I'm sorry, I just meant... We need new breeders. Look for new subjects. We're having difficulties getting new subjects within our territory. Then look for them outside our domains! Maria, thank you for what you've done for me. You would've done the same for me. I don't know if I would have the courage. So? Is it happening? Tomorrow night. How? In the garbage truck. So have you thought about it? Do you agree now? Go fuck yourself! Calm down, boy. You're gonna stay in that cage a bit longer, to clear up your mind. This proves that the human body can take more than three and a half minutes. So, my General, we can't allow that doctor to keep working for The Cause. She's a menace. Very well, young girl. You've proved your loyalty. Members like you give us strenght to keep fighting for a better world. That's why you will have the privilege of commanding the execution of that traitor! But my General, I didn't think she was going to be executed. And what did you expect? Did you think The Cause would forgive such betrayal?? No, not that. I was just expecting solitary confinement. Because she's still a scientist after all. And she's also my mother. Whoever isn't with me, is against me. Our regime can't count on people that don't adapt to The Cause. But my General, I... There is no other way. The Cause is counting on you. Dr. Franz, if I'm not mistaking you're looking for a chance to occupy a certain position. Is that right? I believe The Cause needs more dedication. More love. Which my colleague, Dr. Nicole... Get to the point, Dr. You'll continue with all the medical services for The Cause. And you'll be in charge of the tests. Yes, my Commander. I will honour The Cause. I'm sorry, mother. I did what I thought was right. I understand. After all, it was me who brought you to this hellhole, and it's fair that I pay for it. When you change your mind, boy, let me know. Goodbye, mother. Goodbye, child. Ready! Aim! Fire! This is kinda weird. Kinda? There's something in the air. We'll do this: You'll go through the bushes and get in through the back. We'll go through the front. Be careful, there might be some booby traps. Come on, Jo. Do you wanna teach the father how kids are made? I know what I'm doing. Let's go. Jo! Get me out of here! I'm hanging upside down! I've got bad intestines. I hurt my leg! You're a moron! Water... water... Is there any water around here? What do you want water for? I just shitted all over myself. You're such a coward. Coward? Me? I shitted myself because I was hanging upside down I've got bad intestines. Move! No, please don't do this! Fire! Let's go! Get out of the way, you son of a bitch! Gato, let's get all these bodies out of the way. I don't want anything left on the road. And why don't we use the truck? Are you stupid? They would spot us from miles away. Alright, but first I'm gonna wash my pants in the water over there. I stink so bad I can't even stand myself. So, gypsy? I think we're gonna have to wait a little longer. Why? What happened? The Dr.'s daughter. The chiefs aren't satisfied with her, and it looks like they want to get rid of her. -Impossible- -How do you know that? I heard two guards talking. If anybody asks for me, I went to inspect the water. It seems that they altered it somehow. But that's not possible. She was the one who found out about the betrayal. She denounced her own mother. But she failed in the execution. Send for her. Attention all patrols. Zeida is to be detained, and brought back to headquarters. Message received by Patrol 26. What could've happened? I don't know, they want her head. Headquarters... this is Patrol 26. We found her in Sector 4 but she shot at us. Hey, friend. Having some fun? That's very good. Our country needs people willing to work hard. Shut your mouth, Gato. Don't be afraid, we just need some information. Have you seen any patrol or soldiers in the area? You can talk with us, partner. We're friends. I know, they probably also have your daughters in their hands. They do. Was it you that killed that patrol over there? You better get out of here. If they catch you, your hides won't be worth a dime. We know that. Listen, I've worked the land. I know you always have a little bottle hiding somewhere. That's what killed my foreman. His liver got this big from so much... Do you have any? Go get it. Wait, wait! You can fill this up. Didn't I tell you they had some? We found Zeida. Shoot to kill. It's an order! Quiet! What are you up to? They want my head. I was one of them. I changed my mind, and this is the only way out. She's lying! I don't trust her. It's a trap! Calm down, boy. It can't be a trap. She killed plenty of them. She deserves a chance. What do you think, Gato? I don't care, as long as she aims the other way. You also killed a patrol. I heard it on the radio. What are you up to? We're doing a professional job. We're trying to free those women. Just the three of you? That's impossible. It will be hard, but our saint is protecting us! She's coming with us. Alright girl, but I'm gonna be right behind you. I'll be watching you. Let's go. They ambushed me! Bastard! Don't play tough, boy. People braver than you have spread their legs. Why don't you go to hell, you son of a bitch! -Sargent Medina! -Yes, sir! Something strange is going on. Patrols are disappearing, the girl is on the loose and you're just standing there like an idiot! But Lieutenant, this kid... I know very well about your personal issues, Medina. First things first. Organise a search party for the whole territory. And I want results! Yes, Lieutenant! This is starting to smell really bad. Would this be the right time? I don't know yet, but we'll take advantage of this. There's something going on. Everybody line up here! We need to get this girl, dead or alive. Everybody to the truck. Let's go! Gypsy, wait! I've got a surprise for you. -What is it? -Look! Where did you get this? -I stole it from the kitchen. -Now we're talking. Watch out! The guard! Hide this! You step exactly where I step. Gato, you and the kid cover our backs. Let's go. Hey, kid, didn't you listen to him? I'm in command back here. And since you're new at this, you should step only where I step. Because if you step on a landmine... Watch out. See, kid? He found one over there. There's one here. Jo! I stepped on one! Come here, goddammit! Stay still, I'm coming. It's just a stick, asshole. My General, despite my men's shortcomings we have all the territory under control. Control? Do you have the nerve to say that? Three men are killing entire patrols! Not three, four. Zeida joined them. Who are those rats and what hole did they come from? My General, you said it yourself: whoever isn't with us, is against us. I can imagine who's behind this. There's only one man in the world capable of such a suicide mission. I say suicide, because they're not coming out of this alive. His name is Jo He's been in Angola, Argelia, Vietnam... Always as a soldier of fortune. What the hell are you doing that you didn't catch him yet? I was getting to that, General. I don't know how they got through Sector 2. But I know they're gonna try to enter over here. We're gonna let them enter And then... I see. I hope this time there aren't any mistakes. Son of a bitch! Why do you hate Asparagus? Where do you know him from? We were together in several battles. Until he pulled a trick on me. He went away with my half of the pay. I swore I won't die until I get what's mine. But I don't know that General. He's a former Nazi. A Hitler follower. He's got the crazy idea of creating a pure race. My mom was deceived by him. And you? Why are you involved in this? I was blind... I bought the story about a better world. A new mankind, full of peace and love. Until my fanatism made me betray my own mother. Very nice! I'm over there with the mosquitos, and you're here having all the fun. I want some too. That's something you'll have to work out with her. Hey, what is that? I'm only joking! I don't care about a skinny, ugly ass like yours. It's time. Maria and I will go in to the front, when we do the signal, you come. We're not going. What's wrong with you? Are you afraid? She's right, gypsy. We won't get out of here. And what other option we have? We were 20 when we got here. And how many are left now? But I don't have the courage. Me neither. I'll ask the Lieutenant to send me to the mine. It's better than here. And you really believe that? It's all bullshit! We're like oranges to them. They suck our juice and throw the rest away. All the others are dead. There isn't any mine! You're wrong. There's no reason for them to do that. Alright. Maria and I will try it. If we make it through, you'll be saved. See, boy? You didn't need any of that. Now we agree. Where are the women? In the third cell block Beto, you guard the entrance. Those women are trying to escape. They're gonna ruin everything! Do you know them? One is Ramirez's daughter, the other one's a gypsy. Then they are the ones we're looking for. She's good with the knife Let's go! My boy, you'll be the happiest man around here. Soldier! Go to the quarters and bring Maria. Quiet, don't make a racket! We're friends. They sent us to rescue you. I can't trust you. She's part of this! But she's with us now. You can trust her. -Where are the others? -In the quarters. Let's look for them. But they don't want to come. We'll force them to come. Zeida, take them to the hole in the fence and wait for us there. Let's go. Where are the two missing? I'm talking to you! Don't you see she can't talk? Then you answer me. Where are your friends? Get out of here. Everything's gonna blow! Do you wanna burn to death? Hurry up! Where are the others? They went to get them. Gato, get these girls to the other side of the fence and come back. We're gonna set this place on fire. Wait for me. I don't wanna miss the party. Go. Quick! RISE AND FALL OF THE III REICH Take them to the fence, I have to go back! Do you see what I'm seeing? Shoot him in the head! Shut up! You're gonna ruin everything. Let the girls get through the fence first. Then we'll take care of him. Come here! Quick! Let's get out of here! Stop that, goddammit! They killed the kid and that woman! I'll get them! Are you crazy? They're already dead. But Beto was a nice kid! I won't let these motherfuckers burn his body! He knew what the risks were when he got into this. Now we've got to save these women. -Bastards! -Stop it. Let's go! Let's get out of here or they'll catch us! No, we'll stay here. -Are you crazy? -Why crazy? From here on, the field is mined. It's too dangerous. We're gonna sleep here. -Gato. -Yes, partner. First watch is mine. Finally! It was always me! What's the matter with you? Is anybody hurt? Why do you put that face? Nobody's a child here. From here on, anyone can get shot. So let's keep our heads up! I'm not sleepy. I'll stay with him. You better keep a real watch or the enemy will catch you with your panties in your hand! I don't think these girls will get through the mined field. That's exactly what I was thinking. We'll have to work that out. We better go around in the other direction. That's all fenced. We'll get through here. Gato, get that old piece of wood. Are you sure they won't get through the mined field? Is not humanly possible, General. They're cornered. General, if they ran away with the girls they will return them to their families. That's why we should pay a visit to all of them. Finally a good idea! We need to be there before them. Let's go! Go, go! Come on, woman! Gato, I'll go first. Then you cross them over. Come on! Hurry, hurry! Zeida: you and the women, hide in that hole. Gato, you watch the back. We'll get them by surprise. Hey, give me that gun. Do you know how to use it? Of course, otherwise I wouldn't ask. Everybody on their feet. Come on! She's dead. We should do something for her. Do what? We can't stop now. He's right. She's dead. Let's go. There's nothing we can do about it. Gato, put her in that ditch. The Sergeant fell in an ambush. Let's help him! No, Lieutenant. Please! I know it was you who called them. Where are they? I didn't call anybody. Don't kill me! Talk, or I'll kill your wife. I don't know anything. Nobody came here. Don't do this! So, what shall we do now? Are you gonna talk? Or should I kill you as well? You filthy dog! Bastard! Take him away from me! Son of a bitch! They're an inferior race, Lieutenant. They would never talk. Let's go. So? Nothing. Nobody knows anything, nobody saw anything. I've lost all hope. God have mercy on us. We can only pray. Let's get a closer look. You stay here. What kind of people are they? Did they really need to do this? What did you expect? Every fanatic is a potential psycho. And their daugher is one of the girls that are with us. Don't say anything to her. We're gonna have to bring her along. Did you find anything? Is my father there? There's nobody there. They must've moved elsewhere. You'll have to come with us. No. I know my father very well. There's something wrong here. He wouldn't leave without seeing me first. Do you think we're lying? No... You're not a liar. But I see what you're trying to do. Let's go. And what do we do with her? Hide the body, we have to move fast. Without a burial? That's not right! There's no time. They're catching up with us. We have to move. Listen, girl. I don't know how to pray. But may God keep you in his soul. Come on, move! Hey Jo, they're getting too close! Let's stop here. Come. Ok, let's get them. Gypsy, take the other girls over there. And you Zeida, get over here. Understood? Gato, you cover our backs. You'll be the first one to shoot. Jo! That one's getting away! I saw him. I'm gonna get him. Sector 6 calling Headquarters. Over. Sector 10 patrol This is Sgt. Asparagus. Over. Sector 5 Patrol. Headquarters calling. Over. Sector 4 Patrol. Headquarters calling. Answer me. What's going on? We're inncomunicated, my General. I don't like this at all. Is it much farther now? No, my General. We're about to get there. We have to move fast. That explosion must've exposed our position. The area is clear, my General. We should be careful. They could've gotten here first. We'll leave the jeep here. And we'll continue on foot... and quiet. Yes, my General. We know it was you who hired those dirty mercenaries. That's why we came to congratulate you. Maria, do you know who lives there? Mr. Osiris. The father of the girl that went mad. He had two imprisoned daughters. Who else lives there? Him, his wife and a daughter. This looks very strange. Yes, very strange. How's the situation over there? Bad. Something doesn't look good. And what do we do? We'll do the same as always. Zeide and the girls go to the left. You attack from the right. I'll go in the center. Stop it, Lieutenant. Hands up! Hi, Jo. It's been a long time, isn't it? It could only have been you, Jo. You haven't changed at all. You still kill for money. And you're the same dirty bastard you've always been. Where's the money you stole from me? I know, you spent it on women. They charge extra to sleep with you. You're a disgusting pig. I knew you were going to get out of that situation. It's a shame you weren't here, with me. We could've raised an empire. Asparagus, we've been together in several difficult situations. I obeyed your orders. I thought you were a great warrior. But that betrayal... I still can't swallow it. And doing business with traitors is really bad. So, Lieutenant... this is it. Don't forget I saved your skin several times! This is for my mother, Lieutenant! -What now, Jo? -I don't know. My roots aren't here anymore. I'd like to know other places. Can my weapon be useful? Who knows? Somewhere in the world, there's somebody that needs someone like us. Come on, don't be sad. Get your head up! You're good with knives, I'm good with the machine gun. We could make a great pair. Well, I don't have anywhere to go. See? Come with me and I'll take care of you.
