At ease. Well, let's get to it. Never known you any other way. Intelligence binder. It's fallen into enemy hands. It has the names and locations of hundreds of Vietnamese operatives working with our military. As you can imagine, it's imperative that their identities not fall into the Viet Cong. [slurps] That binder must be retrieved and destroyed. At any cost. Understood. We sent two Special Forces teams north to recapture it. They're on the route back to us. Where? North of the DMZ. Small outpost in the Quang Tri province. Area's hot. If the Viet Cong discover the binder is missing... They'll send a division after it. Expect a firefight. When do I leave? Chopper's ready. I'm sending Crawford with you. Crawford? What aren't you telling me? It's chess. Let's stay ten moves ahead. [helicopter whirring] I'm Corporal Ackerman, engineer, sir. You in charge? O-Of the camp, yes, sir. The-- The ARVN soldiers fall under the Special Forces who are training them, sir. Leaving you the tents. Sir? Do you understand the nature of my presence here? No, sir. Your mission has not been disclosed to me, sir. Take me to HQ. This way, sir. What are your orders? Sir, to assess the viability of this site as a forward base location. Study the topography, sight lines, threat levels, evaluate what construction equipment is needed for a base, and to establish a 100% secure camp perimeter concurrently, sir. Concurrently? Yes, sir. 100% secure? That is the attitude I must maintain, sir. A highly classified package is due to be delivered here. This has yet to occur, correct? Yes, sir. Uh, uh, no. No, sir. It has not occurred, sir. To be painfully clear: If any package, no matter how small, were brought to this location, you would know about it! I'm in charge of the camp, sir. Except for the ARVN soldiers and the Special Forces commandos. Except for them, sir. Leaving you the tents. Sir? Dismissed. [soldier] Easy. Belt-fed, gas-operated, 1,800 meters effective range. [Ackerman grunts] [grunts] Hey. Uh, do you need help with anything? Aren't you eager? Sir... What? Did you find out what we are really doing out here? They're not building a base out here, right? We're too exposed. Guys-- Doesn't that captain-- Wait, wait, wait. That guy is a captain, right? Is that what he's doing here? I'm assuming you told him we've been done here for weeks. Yeah. Guys. Guys, guys, guys. Please, please. I, um-- I just need to know if, uh, if you've seen a package get delivered here. Package? Do we get mail service out here? No. No, no, no. Never mind-- Well, no-- Never mind. Just... As you were. Forget about it. Thank you. [groaning] Hey! Hey! I need to be painfully clear about something. Have either of you witnessed the Special Forces boys receive a package to this location? Mail? We don't get mail service out here. No. No, not like mail. And not officially delivered. Covertly brought here. No. You seen anything looked like that? No, nothing like that. Well, you know how they are. They might not disclose something like that to the engineers, but I need to know everything that goes on inside this camp, all right? You feel like you don't? Yes. No, I... I do not have eyes on 50 men. All right? So I ask my team for a little bit of assistance. You are a part of this team? Yes, sir. Yeah, I am part of your team, sir. Who's the new captain? He's just a new captain. Were you supposed to have a package for him? Never mind. As you were. [Ackerman] Have you seen a package? My friend... What? I need you to get down and grab yourself a rifle. Why? What do you see? Movement. Where? Somewhere. American? [soldier] American. Your engineers set mines around the camp, right? [Ackerman] Uh-huh. Please safely escort our guests. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Shit. [panting] Ah. Hi. How you doing? I'm Corporal Ackerman. Water. Water? Yeah. Yeah, we have water. Sure. You want some? Um, okay. Just follow me. Uh, we got some at the base. Just, you have to be careful because we've got mines around the perimeter. So just... Captain Mora, Special Forces Commander. My family summers in Lake Tahoe. Are you familiar with Lake Tahoe? Tahoe is a term we are familiar with. Just the two of you? There were six of us, sir. Does the enemy know about this? There were six, sir. The safety's off tonight, sir. Okay. Let's get you guys some R and R. [gunshot] [Ackerman] Shit. Friendly fire! Friendly fire! Dude, don't! Are you crazy? You don't want to do that. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What the fuck were you doing? [gasping] I did not order you to breathe! I ordered you to answer my question! [Ackerman] Sir, he was cleaning his weapon, sir. That is correct! He is under your command, so you will answer for him! What the fuck was he doing? Sir, he was cleaning his weapon, sir. I ordered him to do it, sir. Sir, it is my fault, sir. What the actual fuck does that child need with a gun? That was not rhetorical, dipshit! Sir, protection of this camp, sir. He does not protect. You and your engineers do not protect. You build. You dig a ditch. You plant some goddamn mines. But you sure as shit don't fire your weapons in my perimeter! Sir, yes, sir! But what you can do is help that fucking child build a world-class shit-eating latrine! I have it in my possession. [airplane passing overhead] Excellent. Describe the contents. I have a translator on that right now. ETA for confirmation is five hours. Confirmed. What type of documents are these, based on the structure? Maps and lists. Does it read like a ledger? Yes. Listen to me. Cross-reference the words from the ledger. And scan the map. Yes. There is a relationship between the markings on the maps and the words in the columns. See if the same words appear on the maps in the binder. Yeah, I recognize them. This is Trieu Phong, right in our own backyard. Well, it seems we have a map of potential locations to operatives, doesn't it? The sooner we get this to a secure base, the better. How long until extraction? ASAP, first thing tomorrow, barring a marine layer or any other bullshit. Confirmed. [laughing] Oh, you missed the move. Hey, buddy. What the fuck you want? Do we help them? What? Dig a shit hole? [scoffs] Okay, yeah, yeah. You could go if you want. But hey, make sure you're sleeping outside tonight, okay? 'Cause I don't want to have nobody stinkin' up the place. You already stink enough. [soldier] But it's not our call, is it? We have to follow our-- our leader. Come on, man. What's in the binder? Wait, you looked in the package? Tell me you're kidding. Is everyone in this squad a fucking moron? [smacks lips] [exhales] Let me tell you something, guys. I don't have a good hand. I haven't had a good hand all night. Uh, so if you could, like, trade, that'd be good-- [stammering] What was in it? Words, letters, and the like. So... Asshole. Look, honestly, half of it was in Viet Cong with some English code words next to it, so... Like a ledger? What do you mean, a ledger? A list. Yeah, like a list. Like why are so many of us engineers and ARVN sitting out here for a month if we're not actually building a base? Maybe Captain Mora is-- knows what our mission is once he decodes whatever the binder is. Hey, what's his deal anyway? Is he in charge now? Is anyone in charge? Why do you rag on him so hard? [laughs] Gates wants a promotion. What do you guys think, huh? Gates for corporal, 1966? [laughter] You know, I'm afraid there's gonna come a time when he gets all of our asses killed. You stick close to Captain Mora. I'd rather have a hard-ass giving me orders than a little "buddy." Take all three. [chattering] [metal squeaks] Ah. Hey. This bullshit tastes like horseshit this morning. [soldier 1] Yeah, I know, that's right. [chuckles] [soldier 2] Hey. I like it. [soldier 1] Come on, man. You eat that rancid baby shit and just do your job. [Gates] Oh, right on. I'm crushed under the weight of your rancid words, sir. So crushed. Ain't that right, boy? Can I go home now? What kind of horseshit are we not gonna be able to shit later? You-- You know the thing with, um, with that is that MREs only contain one gram of fiber? So... Did you sift through your own shit to discover that? No. That information was achieved through something called reading. I'm reading that your face was so far up Captain Mora's asshole that you just sampled it off your nose. [soldiers hooting] [soldier 3] Damn, man. The ultra-smart engineer has no reply? In front of your men? Y'all want him to roast me? [soldiers jeering] Come on, Ackerman. Ackerman. A true leader can out-shit-talk a dumb grunt like me. Not before my coffee. That's no fun. [machine gun fire] [shouting] Get down! Get down! Stay covered! [whistle blowing] [explosion] [shouting] [shouting continues] [Ackerman exclaims] [screams] [screams] [soldier] Take cover! Go, go, go, go, go! [Mora] Get your head in the battle, son! And get to the 60! Now! Y-Y-Yes, sir. [shouting] Everyone, full assault! Now! [shouting] Kill them all! No! No! God-- Goddamn it! [grunts] Shit! [Mora on radio] Clear the line. Captain. [airplane passing overhead] Give me a status report. Fourteen casualties. Forty enemy dead. And the binder? Gone. Then why are you still alive? [scoffs] You fought off an ambush, outnumbered and surrounded. They knew the value of what you had. Well... to be fair, we didn't know if the information was legit. I need to be in the field, James. I don't know what's really happening sittin' behind this desk. You can do a lot of good at that desk. The army needs combat vets calling the shots, not bureaucrats. Well, this office is full of those. Damn it, James. I can't know the enemy if I can't see 'em fight. Tell me the truth. They're relentless and fast. Give me more. They'll face down the barrel of your gun and charge in. Totally fearless. What it must feel like to command a platoon of men like that. We are fighting them with engineers, sir. Special Forces might be the tip of the spear, but the rest... they're construction workers. We're up against the clock, James. Whatever your orders are, I will not fail you again. We have any idea which direction the attack came from? We were suddenly surrounded. And we have no trace on which direction they left with? Minimal. The battle tore up the remaining terrain. I'm gonna send someone in. Someone who can take care of this. Someone who thinks outside the box. Confirmed. This is a new kind of warfare. Sir. You, uh, you asked for the map, sir? You studied the surrounding topography. If you had to guess, which direction? Um, well, sir... Cambodia is that way. And Hanoi is that way. [helicopter whirring] That is very fucking helpful. [barks] Morning, sir. Good morning. [sighs] Where's your boss? Captain Mora is CO. You can find him at HQ with Ackerman. All right. [helicopter whirring] Captain Mora, sir? Lieutenant Colonel Miller. Drummond gave me a report that you guys were attacked by an invisible enemy that seemed to come out of nowhere. Not familiar with that description. Now you are. Ackerman, right? Yes, sir. Let's hear it. We had sight lines going out 50 meters, sir. We surveyed the surrounding topography and had claymores and flares set to trip wire deep in the jungle. But they seemed to bypass all that, right? Yeah. Like they came out of nowhere? More practically speaking, we were dug in, and they moved about undetected because they're familiar with the land. We need to find out where they're going. Where they're going? Don't you mean where they came from? No. Can you track them? That's the idea. We need to find them immediately. Well, that is usually the desire, sir. I'm not experiencing a sense of urgency from you, sir. Well, Captain Mora, huntin' is huntin'. There is a highly classified document which is missing and must be retrieved. Time is of the essence. I appreciate that, sir. Ackerman. Sir? Get me a dead body. Nice fresh one. [Miller] Thank you, sir. [clears throat] What's with the kid? Engineer. Very green. Engineer, huh? Good. We're gonna need him with what we find. And what is that? Well, I expect to find their subway system, so to speak. Your cooperation on this is much appreciated, sir. [Miller] Come on. Go on. [dog panting] [Miller] Go on, boy. Come on. Come here. Hey. Look at me. Hey, you good? [barks] All right. Time to hunt. I'll need three teams. Okay, boys, let's move out. Come on. [dog panting] Not bad back there. That was you on the 60? Yeah. Hey, thanks. That's where a boot like you will earn the rank. More importantly, the respect of your men. You, uh, mind saying that a little bit louder, how good a job I done, just so the guys could hear? Doesn't work that way out here. Nothing can be faked. If I see it, they'll see it. You short-time, Rusty? Double digits. I'm so short I can't see over the dogs up there. Sixty-four days and I wake up and my ass is di-di out of the bush. You? Um, 325 days. How about you count the months at this point? [machine gun fire] [Ackerman] Rusty! Rusty. Rusty! Medic! [Ackerman] Rusty! [shouting] [continues shouting] [soldier] C-Team! Be my six! Be my six! Wills! [dog barking] Move your men to the right. Stay low. Go! Yes, sir. C-Team! [shouting] Go! Make way! Make way! Make way now! Stay low. Cole, I'm on your six! [shouting] [soldier] I got two! I got two! [shouts] [shouts] Clear! What is that? [Miller panting] We're fighting a new enemy. They don't come from the sky. They don't come across water. And they don't come on land. They come from the earth. Flashlight. I need you to send a message to Captain Mora. Pay close attention. Yes, sir. [static, voices on radio] Captain. [Mora on radio] It's to a tunnel. Miller said they can surface an entire regiment through them. They go on for miles. Miles? Did he say how long it would take to cover miles of tunnel? He didn't. Miller's plan is to cover above and send a team below, see what's down there and map it out for us. He said subterranean warfare is new. Lot of unknowns. Crawford there? As requested. So we can expect the binder is in the tunnels. And they have limited comms. Which gives us a window of time. Do we have protocol for tunnel warfare? No. Improvise. You got two hours. What's at the end of two hours? The end. Where do we put the pawns and where do we put the queen? Bishops, rooks, knights... up on top. Pawns down below. And one queen with them. I'll go below. Negative. I need you above ground. Sir, my experience is an asset. You're my link in this fight. I can source a radio man. Are my orders received, Captain? Crystal clear, sir. Speak. They're kids. I'm afraid they don't have the stones for close combat. Tell them to grow a pair. Confirmed. Over and out. Captain, step aside. I want to speak to Crawford in private. Stepping out. Sir? Crawford. Are you seeing anything Mora hasn't? I believe you're asking for a contingency plan when the two hours are up. Does a fail-safe exist? It does. Is it an ironclad solution? It clears the board of all the pieces, but that's only a call you can make. Two hours. Then clear it. Ten-four. [rain falling] [thunder rumbling] Okay. Understand me? Gotta get to L-4. We got two hours. [sniffles] Copy that. Let's brief them. Gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please. A binder was stolen during the battle that contains information about South Vietnamese operatives north. We need to retrieve or destroy that binder at all costs. Now, we will have teams covering the jungle for enemy resurfacing, but we will have to send a team below. Ackerman, your team's below. Cole, you're with them. Cole takes the rear. The rest of you concentrate on mapping that network. Sir, what does my team offer, sir? Jesus, Ackerman. Are you seriously asking me why you're being sent below, sir? Yes, I am, sir. Okay. It's obvious. You're an engineer and you're smart. I need your eyes to analyze what's down there. I will provide a detailed map, sir. Well, I'd appreciate that, Ackerman. However, the priority of this mission is the retrieval or the destruction of that binder. While that is being pursued, I need you boys to focus on mapping that network. And boys, it's likely gonna be a labyrinth down there. So, watch your topknot. At minimum, you're recon. At best, you get in the shit and you save the day and we all live above ground as normal mammals. Yes, sir. You gonna save the day, young man. [Miller] Ackerman. Cole is your ace. If it gets hot, you lean on him. The rest of you boys concentrate on mapping that network and get back here alive. You have two hours to complete your mission. What happens at the end of two hours, sir? You have two hours. Lock and load, gentlemen. Godspeed. Damn, man. That's fucking narrow. I'll take point. I don't mind, sir. No, that's my job. Why don't you lead from the middle? Help Boyd and Gledhill down there? Sure thing. You ain't gotta ask. Just make the order. Okay. Wait until the person ahead of you gives the all-clear before descending. [Ackerman grunts] [water dripping] [breathing heavily] Clear! [grunting] [grunts] [Cole] I'll see you on the other side, man. [Ackerman breathing shakily] [Gledhill] These are cool, man. They made all these? [Ackerman] Hey. Count pace with me. [soldier] Yeah, you got it. [breathing heavily] [Gledhill] What the fuck? Oh, shit! Fuck. [dog panting] Shh, it's okay. [birds calling] [grunts] Fuck. [Ackerman breathing heavily] [gasps] [Cole] Make space. Pass it along. [soldier] Cole says make space. What's your count to this juncture? I got 35 meters. You? Okay, I had 40. That's close enough. Keep charting. [breathing heavily] It's clear. [Cole] What's the status? Mapping the tunnels. But, um, I think we-- we gotta split up or-- We split up. Who else can create a map of the progress? Nevins. Okay. He'll go with me and another. Give me anyone difficult off your hands, I'll see to it they stay in line. Gledhill, Nevins. You're going with Cole. So, Mera, Boyd, Gates, you're with me. Any direction gets too hot or confusing, we rendezvous back here. Okay? [soldier] Copy. Okay. Let's move out. [soldier] Shit. [breathing heavily] [Gledhill] Hey, I-- I can take point. [Cole] I need you to cover my six. Don't you know that's most important? [Gledhill] Yeah, that's-- that's right. That's right. [Nevins] Hey, thanks for your bravery, Gledhill. [Gledhill] Yeah, no problem. [Nevins whispers] God, you're a tool, man. [Ackerman breathing heavily] [Ackerman] Okay. All right, Mera, I need you to take point. Go slow and don't go far. [Mera] Okay, sir. [Ackerman] Gates, stay on our six. [Gates] Yeah. [Mera exclaims] Fuck! Fuck! Shit! [Gates] Hey, come on! [Ackerman] Mera! [Mera gasping] [Ackerman] Mera! [Mera panting] [Gates] What's wrong? Shh, shh. Calm down. It's okay. It's okay. What's wrong? Oh, shit. It's okay. It's all right. [gasping] It's all right. Can these things kill me? No. They're just like really bad bee stings. How you know that? I read about it. Okay, listen, Mera. If we come across an exit shaft, I'm gonna send you and Gates up and back to camp. Okay? Yes, sir. I need you to get up. You gotta get up. All right? Come on, come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go. [Ackerman] I'm comin' across here. All right. Okay. Come on, boys. Easy, easy. Shh. [whispering] Gledhill? Gledhill? Gledhill? Fuck. Gledhill? [exclaims] [Nevins breathing heavily] [Nevins breathing heavily] Oh, fuck. Hey. He's fucking dead. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Hey. Huh? Look, we have to go. Look. Listen to me. We have to go. Stay here. [gunshots] [shouting] [gasping, groaning] Nevins, come here! Check-- Check them. Check all of them. [groaning] [Cole] Find the goddamn binder. I-- I can't-- I don't see shit. Just look. Hey, I have to-- I just gotta find this thing and I'll get you out. We'll get you topside. It'll all be good. Okay? It ain't here, brother. Fucking-- Fucking useless shit! Hey. Hey, prop me up. I command you. Now! Hey. Hey, I got you. I got you, bro. Come here. Come here. [Nevins groaning] [gasping] Fuck. Oh, fuck. Give me the AK. [groaning] [panting] Listen. Listen. They're closing on in. Your friend is dead. Go on, get out of here. Hey. We don't leave men behind. That's a command. It's just war. It's just war. I'll buy you time. It's gonna be okay. [groans] [exclaims, panting] Clear. Okay. Mera, Boyd, I need you to cover our exits. Oh, here we go. Here we go. [Ackerman] It's a-- It's not gonna be papers. It's-- It's like a ledger. It's bound. Like a book. Mera, exits. Yes, sir. Here we go. Hold that. That's a map. [Ackerman] You see this? [Gates] You found something? [Ackerman] It's a map. [Gates] Okay. Okay. [Ackerman] I'm trying to find our camp. [Gates] Write something down. [Boyd gasps] [Ackerman] Boyd! Boyd, that door. [Ackerman] See these? [Gates] Oh, shit. [Gates] I got you some tape. [screams] Watch the back. Okay. Okay. Let's go. Let's get what we're looking for, right? It's not here, man. How do you know that? Because... you saw how many guys came after it at camp. They wouldn't leave it unguarded. All right? And those shots we just heard, that's our team. We gotta find them. Let's go. Get up. Come on. Okay. [humming] [footsteps approaching] [body thuds] These fuckers need to come out and start fighting like men. New objective. We take the fight to them, put an end to this bullshit. We're in and out in under an hour. When hour's up, anything in that tunnel is dead. Come on. [dog panting] It's better for the dog if your boys are downwind. Copy. [dog whimpers] What is it? Bunker. Where? I don't know. I gotta flank wide. How do you know? It's that nasty fermented fish sauce they fucking eat. Dog's not the only one who can smell. You slacking on me, boy? Huh? No. [dog whimpers] [Wills] All right, let's go. Slowly. Lights. All right, we're clear. Shit. Oh, fuck. Look at the size of these things. You could feed a whole regiment. [Boyd] How many soldiers you think are down here? [Ackerman] That doesn't matter. We're at a dead end. We gotta keep moving. You know where we are? Yeah. Then why are we at a dead end? Because it's a maze. You find your way through by eliminating dead ends. Stop. [panting] Nevins? [Nevins] Ack? Come here. Nevins. Oh, shit. You're hurt? Fuck. [Gates] Where's Gledhill? They're all fucking dead. Gledhill's dead? Yeah. Cole? It's his blood. [Gates] No. [Mera] Cole is gone? We're fucked. He was our best chance of getting out of here. Tighten up. What happened? I-- I don't-- I don't fucking know, man. We-- We found a room. I mean, everything fucking just went to shit, man. We-- We fucking found this room and there was nothing in it. We searched the whole fucking thing and I-- I just couldn't find shit, man. It's all right. And I, uh-- I crawled back here, I got bit by spiders and shit. Fuck, man. Fuck. Fuck. This place is fucked, man. We're all gonna fucking die! [Ackerman] We're not gonna die. [Nevins] Yeah? Do you know the exits? Yeah? Then which fucking way? [Ackerman] Yes. [Gates] He doesn't know what he's doing. Yes, I do. I know where we are and I know how to get out of here. Bullshit. That map tells you the same exit that we already came, the same exit we all already know. You are lost. We are about a klick away from camp. So, we're due for another exit. Now, I told Mera I would get him out of here. That's what I'm gonna do. But I need your help. Please, man. We've been, uh... yelling and-- and they can probably hear us. So ca-- can we move? Please? Let's go. He's fucking lost, man. Hey, Gates for corporal, 1966. [Ackerman] Double the space between you. This is tighter. [inhales sharply] [panting] Mera? I got daylight. Okay. You think you can cover me? Yeah. One second. You got me? Yeah, I got you. Okay. [breathing heavily] [soldier speaking Vietnamese] [gunshots] [Miller] Friendly? Yeah. [Miller] Who is it? It's Ackerman! I've got a wounded man! Am I clear to come out? Hold your fire! [Ackerman] They shot Mera! Ackerman! Yeah? All clear. Come out. Guys, send Mera up! Send him up. We're good. [Mera groaning] Oh, fuck! Come on, Mera. Hey. Come on, man. Come on, man. I got you, buddy. No, no. I got you. Okay, I won't touch it. Here. I got you. Come on. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Lay down. Lay down right here. [screams] [Miller] Where's he hit? [Ackerman] Mera? Where'd they get you, buddy? Huh? Where'd they get you? My shoulder. Shoulder. His shoulder. I can feel it in all my body. Okay. All right. Please! It's okay. You're gonna be all right. [Mera panting] [Miller] Ackerman, come here. [Ackerman] Yeah? Okay. [Gates] It's all right. It's all right, it's all right. Your boy's been shot in his extremities. No organs or arteries damaged. He ain't gonna die. But his body is trying to panic and go into shock. If that happens, his life's in danger. What he needs right now is people around him who aren't panicking, who are firm and calm. You're his leader. What do you think you should do? Yes, sir. [Gates] You're all right. You're all right. Hey, uh, hey, Mera. [Mera groaning] Hey, can you do me a big favor? Can you hold this for me? Hey, so I just spoke to the colonel. You know what he said? Huh? Look at me. He said you're gonna be fine. Huh? So, you're gonna be fine, right? Yeah? Okay. Okay, do me a favor. Breathe like you're fine. All right? I'm going to be fine. Yeah, breathe. [Miller] Okay, you three take him back to the camp and report his status to Captain Mora. Just you and me, cowboy. [Wills] Copy that. [Miller] You got the documents? Yeah. Yeah. [Miller] Wills, take a look. [Wills] Can I see them? [Ackerman] You want one, sir? Here you go. What we got? [Wills] These ain't them. Fucking shit. We missing someone? I'm sorry. [Miller] Cowboy, why don't you take a minute. Take ten steps away, turn around. You are ordered to breathe. You are ordered to be alone. Go on now. [Mera continues groaning] I'm sorry about your boys. Pretty hot down there, huh? Heavy contact with the enemy, sir. We're two KIA and now one wounded. It twisted and turned. It's a very extensive system down there, sir. You're just a klick away from forward camp. Yeah, that's roughly my estimate. Let me take a look. Yes, sir. You was just about counting steps? Been trying to. Is it accurate? I hope so. Gates, Boyd. I need you two to make me a copy of this map. And, Gates, I want it detailed as this one is. You got it. No problem. I know you will. All right. So, you want the good news or the bad news? How about the bad news? The Mets lost. And you gotta go back inside. You did good, Ackerman. You did real good. Yes, sir. Get some chow. Clear. Clear. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Hey, hey. [Crawford] Fuck. Hold your fire. [Crawford] Friendlies? Yeah. Yeah, there's four of us in here. Hey, you're, uh-- you're Crawford, right? Yeah. You're "Hack," right? Ackerman. "Ack." How many of you are there? There's three of us. You find the binder? No. Did you? Would I ask if I had? No. What's with the arsenal? Oh, we found their weapons storage. About 50 meters down there, turn right. Go grab yourself something. I think we're good. Suit yourself. There's some good shit in there. Check this baby out. Need a light? Hey, stop. It's not a fucking joke, man. Where are the rest of you? You lost? There were three casualties. One wounded. Is what it is. Hmm? Come on. Let's check this out, see what we can find. Aren't you supposed to be topside, covering the exits? Let's go, big man. Recon down left, see what you find. [Ackerman] Yeah. Ditch diggers, you're going right. You and me are gonna hold this junction, chief. This ain't up for discussion, kiddos. [fingers snap] It's okay. Just be careful. How you feeling, chief? I'm great. Too bad about those casualties. Yes, it is. Hell of a thing sending all you engineers into this shit. Yeah. Why you think they put this whole mission on your shoulders? I don't know. You would have to ask Captain Mora. Well, they want you to find this thing. But what else is your objective? To map the tunnels. [Crawford chuckles] That's a mission, huh? Draw maps? [laughing] "What did you do in the war, Daddy?" "Well, son, I drew maps." [laughing] Wow, you got us figured out. Eh. Wanna know my guess? Sure. Bait. Send you down, hoping they'll go topside. How's that sit with you? Hmm? Hmm? Bait. Mmm. Less than an hour of mapmaking left. Nothing that way. Just a water well and a dead end. But no enemy contact. My team on my six. Ackerman, you and your boys hold this junction. [yells] Turn your lights off. [gasping] [groaning] [metal clanks] Contact. Hold your fire. Hold your fire. Hey, what are you guys waiting for? No, no! Leave them be! Hey, what the fuck do you care? He's barely alive. Yeah, well, then it's a mercy kill. Hey, you leave them. There's no honor in killing sick and wounded. Honor? These guys sharpened stakes, hid them in the ground, and Gledhill died on them, man! I'm sorry that you weren't there to watch him bleed out! Were you guys there for that? [Gates] Relax. Relax? Relax? Is that the honorable thing to do? I'm not trying to take away from what you saw. But this is war, right? It's what you signed up for! [both shouting] Hey! Hey! Hey! I didn't grab you! Don't grab me! None of us were there! That's my fault! It's my fault, okay? And if you think it's right to kill these people, then you should do it. But I am ordering you not to! It's your choice. Captain Mora ordered us down here, right? Yes. Well, then it's his call! And he doesn't give a damn about us or anybody's life! Well, Mora ain't here, is he? Ack's giving orders. Hey, weren't you the one that said stick close to Mora? Don't listen to Ack, because Ack was gonna get us killed. Yeah, you know what? Topside, that's the right call-- you follow the vets. But it's just us down here. And like I said, you choose to follow my orders or you won't. Do you want to do this, Daniel? Do you want to kill these people? We're moving out. We're moving out. Go ahead. [groaning] Fat fuck. [grunts] [gun clicks, gunshot] What the fuck was that? That was Crawford. Hey, what's the point of the map, man? I mean, this is fucking chaos. Do you know the way? I'm just saying. That map's only good for the next person you give it to. So we don't keep going down the same tunnels we done been down. Can you quit your bitching? [rustling] What the fuck is that? [coughing] [high-pitched ringing] [screaming] [groaning] What was that? [screaming continues] [screaming stops] [Gates] Nevins? Nevins? Nevins, let's go. [groaning] Come on, baby. Come on, Nevins. Come on. [coughing] I'm not leaving him. We're not leaving him. We have to. No. You're hurt. We don't leave men behind. We don't leave men behind. Ack, we either take Gates or we drag Nevins's corpse. We can't do both. Come on. Come on. I'm gonna get you out of here. [Ackerman] We're leaving him. No. We gotta leave him. Come on, baby. Get you out of here. We gotta leave him. No, we're not leaving him! Gates. We gotta leave him. Gates, please! No! Please! No! Please, man, please. [Gates shouts, groans] Okay. Move. Grab my fucking arm. Go right. Right. Sit. Sit. [groans] [gasps] I can't hear anything! [panting] Hey, that, uh-- that grenade came from up top, right? The ceiling had a hole in it. Okay. So, they're ventilation shafts. That means multiple layers. 'Cause the smoke from here has to be fed up and out somehow. How big is this fucking place? Hey, Gates. We'll find a ventilation shaft big enough to put you in, get you topside. What about the binder? Do you give a shit? Hell, no. I'm not losing you guys. Come on. [groans] [Ackerman] Good? Let's go. Oh, shit. Shit, I think this is a dead end. [Gates] We can't go no further down. We gotta make a stand. He's right. We fight our way out. [gunshot] Fuck! [shouting] No! [grunting] [gunshot] Gates. Hey! Hey, hey, hey. You all right, Gates? Boyd? You doing good. Don't listen to Nevins. He's an idiot. Ack's a good leader. Okay? Just tell Gle-- Tell Gledhill to do-- do what he says. [shouts] Boyd! Yeah? He's gone. It's... It's just us. I'm sorry. It's okay. We got... [panting] We got 30 minutes. What happens after that? I think Mora only cares about the mission succeeding. Nothing else matters. We... We don't matter. Is the mission over? I don't know. What do you wanna do? They died for that binder. If we finish, it's for them. Twenty minutes. Okay? [sniffles] We don't find it, we get out of here. Okay. But for them. Not for Mora. Okay. Okay, for them. Where do we go now? Up. Okay. Ready? [grunts] Boyd. Come on. [grunts] [Ackerman] Hold on. [Ackerman grunts] Okay. We need to go that way. You take point. You sure? Yeah, you're faster anyway. I'll follow you. [grunts] Okay. [both panting] You know where we are? Yeah, hold on. I think so. Right or straight? Um, go straight. Okay. Storage. Rockets. And grenades. [Ackerman] Good job. Okay. [whirring] [metal clanking] [whirring] [clanking stops] [whirring stops] [metal clanking] [whirring] [chuckles softly] Jackpot! What? The binder? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Um, let me think. Okay. You turn around. We're gonna go back through this way. All right? Okay. Come on. [Ackerman] Hey, Boyd. I'm, uh-- I think-- [Boyd] Yeah? I'm out. You got any other clips? [Boyd] No. I'm out too. [Ackerman] Okay. We gotta search the boxes when we get in there. [grunts] Okay. Quiet. If you, uh-- If we can't find something, we gotta grab an AK. Okay. [soldiers speaking in Vietnamese] [speaking Vietnamese] [grunting] Boyd! Boyd, get the binder! Get the binder! The binder! [yells] Fuck. Hey. Hey, hey. [groans] Get up, get up, get up. Hey, sit down. Hey, hey, hey, hey. The binder? The binder? Have you seen the binder? The bin-- The binder! Have you seen it? Yes? Where? Here? Fuck! Here? Here? Here? Here? Here? Here? Here? Here? Here. Fuck. Okay. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Open. Please, please. [gasps, chuckles] Ah, fuck! [grunting, groaning] Come on! [speaking Vietnamese] This way. Come on. [panting] Boyd! Boyd, go that way! Go! That way! Back! Back! Back! Come on! [explosion] [coughing] Hey, hey, come on. Please, please, I need a minute. My fucking leg. We don't have a minute. Okay, you just go and I'll catch up with you. What? Hey! We don't leave men behind. I left fucking everyone behind, Boyd! They're all fucking dead because of me! No. Those deaths aren't on you. These are Captain Mora's orders, from someone above him, from someone above him, from someone above him! You always gave a shit. Ack! It's nearby. I was here last. I lost my-- my torch. There we go. Okay. [speaking Vietnamese] [knife slashes] [grunting, groaning] [screaming] Ack. Get up! Go! [explosions in distance] [explosion] Time's up. They're still down there. Is that a problem? We needed a fail-safe. Crawford took care of it. I've never known you to turn a blind eye. Or fail. No. But not like this. Victory is measured in body count. How do you count them when they're buried? One by one. Hell of a war. Link up with Miller at the LZ. Confirm mission success. Yeah. It's just a war. [both coughing] [loud rumbling] [Ackerman groans] Come on, man. It's just right there. [coughing, groaning] [gasping] [Wills] Identify yourself! We're friendlies! Hold fire! Who is it? It's Boyd and Ackerman. He's wounded. We need help. Come on. You gotta stop. Get your man up. Can you see my hand? [gasping, coughing] Do you have the package? [Boyd] There. There. How'd you find us? His dogs. Cowboy, we good? Yes, sir. [gasps, coughs] You won the hunt, son. Let's try this again. We've got it. Destroy it. Direct orders. Put the engineer on. General Drummond. This is Ackerman. You did good, kid. It seemed like it was... do or die after two hours, sir. We can't let that information get into enemy hands. If you're overrun before that Huey arrives, we're gonna have to start this whole shit show over. Failure didn't seem like an option, sir. It's your first time in combat, son? [Ackerman] Yes. Well... this is your one time to speak to a general freely. What are you doing? That is a general on the line. You will talk, and you will accept. I'm gonna let you go now. Understand? I have to confirm that they're burning the binder. My friends died bringing that binder back. Is there no... Is there no record of what they did here? Listen to me, son. I didn't write this, and I'm not the first to say it, but a warrior's record is not written in books or decorated with medals. You and your men... you're part of something deeper now. Your blood is in the earth. They live forever. Out. Let it go. That's not what you take from here.
