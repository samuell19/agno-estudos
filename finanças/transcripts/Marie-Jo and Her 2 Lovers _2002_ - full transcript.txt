In the middle of our life?s journey I came within a dark wood where the straight path was lost. Ah, how hard a thing it is to tell what a wild and stubborn wood this was, which terrifies me when I remember. The horrors it awakens are no less bitter than the fear we feel approaching death. Dante Alighieri - The Divine Comedy Mum! Mum! Mum! Why don?t you answer? We?ve been looking for you for hours. Why don?t you just leave me alone? We were worried. What could have happened to me? ?Pinch you? and ?Pinch me? are in a boat... ?Pinch you? falls in the water... Who stays in the boat? What is this? I quit my role as staff representative. What?s worrying you? Nothing, but their problems are suffocating me. I?m sick of it. Their little, petty problems. Now... Now you?ll feel bored. You cut your wrist? What? It?s nothing. I wanted to know if it hurts, so... I did it, but I didn?t feel anything. - You wanted to die? - What? Are you crazy? I never wanted to die. Good night. Good night. I never wanted to die. Don?t ever think things like that. An Israeli was killed this morning in West Jordan by Palestinians... Yes, I?m all right. But it?s Thursday, isn?t it? Don?t hang up. There?s another call. Okay. I?ll call you later. Right? So they changed the day? Of course I?ll be there. See you soon. Where was I? A peripheral layer with hollow concrete bricks including structure and concrete weighing 350 kilos. Hello! Marie-Jo, about my duty schedule. I wanted to know... What do you do at night when you get back from work? What do you think about? You see! I wished that too. Your little problems, your worries... Carmelle?s kids, Ren?s cancer, the overtime, the meals, I?m sick of all this. Huge indemnifications, bonuses. I want to get rid of all this. I just want to think about myself. I voted for you. Only about my problems! Come in! It?s Marie-Jo. - Just a moment. - I never get used to this bad smell. Do you think it?s nice to drink like that? And don?t look at me like that. - Is it Thursday today? - No. On Wednesday I fast, I drink nothing so I?m prepared for Thursday. - It?s difficult, you know. - I?m sure it is. Is it my fault they improved the dialysis? - Is it? - That?s no reason for drinking. Your stinky old man didn?t die yet? Do you think that?s funny? How long has he being doing dialysis? You can live your whole life on dialysis. He?s already lived his life. When do you think life is over? We?re visiting, let?s eat outside. I bought sardines. Come on! Are you going to just stand there? Don?t you want grilled sardines? You could have told me. All right. We?ll use the plastic plates. I?ll take care of the wine. - And I?ll take care of the sardines! - They?re ready. I handled everything. You just have to come down. Come eat with us. Come on, Julie. Come on, guys. We have to take care of the barbecue. Who wants some sardines? Another little sardine. Here! Thank you. Do you have a tattoo? It?s nothing, just a scratch. You could have thought about me and drawn a heart as a vow of love... ?ad vitam aeternam?. - Are you afraid they?ll recognise you? - That?s not funny. They could see you from a helicopter. Or one of those guys who sets up antennas. Or someone walking on the roof, or an angel. - You have to... - Leave. Marco? I enjoyed the time we spent together. No. I just called to say that. And I?m a little unhappier than the last time. A big kiss to you. A very, very big kiss. I prepared quail for you. My little dove. With cabbage, my love. Tomorrow I?ll prepare heart, my heart. You didn?t think that was funny? No? Good morning, gentlemen! Good morning, commander. Good morning, Marco. Is everything okay? Yes. - A cup of coffee? - No, thank you. Now 5 degrees to the right, to 57. Five degrees to the right, to 57. Didn?t you earn more money with the transatlantic? No. But I wanted to pick up my kids from school every day. - So? - So, I?ve got no kids. 13 metres. 12 metres. 10 metres. Hold very tight, because at first the concrete will pour strongly. Stay on the beam. Then you spread it all over the surface. Wait a minute. Stay on the beam. It?s strong. You could fall. Hold it very tight. Spread the concrete like this. Come on. Don?t be afraid. Come on. That?s it. Then you turn. Wait! Move forward. Like that. You see? Move forward! No! Go over there. Over there. Further! You?re doing fine. Hold tight. Pour the concrete to the end. To the end. More! To the end, then you come back. You pour it and then you come back and level it. You did fine. You?re not that bad. We?re finished! Stop the machines. ... has 4,200 employees and uses only six of its planes. Air France estimates 2000 employees are superfluous. The Concorde constructors will ask for an overhaul of the supersonic plane after the accident in Gonesse... You?re back early. Enough for today. It?s too hot. Let?s go to the marina. I haven?t finished. Drop it. I don?t want to go by myself. You never do anything by yourself. Never! We?re not going to close anything? Not even the gate? No. Let them take everything! We?ll start all over again. What?s the matter with you? Things aren?t good? Let?s go to the marina. I don?t want to talk about work. What are you doing? You?ll be expelled. Get out of there. I know the owner. She won?t complain. Look! What is... ? You haven?t... ? Are you okay? - Let?s work... - Now? No, no... tomorrow. It must have been expensive. Why did you do this? Why? Because you?re my wife. Because it?s your dream since you were a child. Because I wanted you to have it so I could use it. And last... because I love you. I love you. Happy birthday! - Sorry! Somebody?s coming! - You?ll be out for a month? - Julie, did you see your dad? - No. Good afternoon. Serve some drinks to those who have just arrived. - What are you doing, dad? - I?m not doing make-up. - Yes, you are! - No. It?s a joke. You put too much. - I know. - Let me do it. - Don?t move. - Is it good? Close your eyes. You put too much. Forget it. I?ll wash my face. - Are you kidding? - The mouth. - Are you having fun? - Who started it? Check! Check! - Sorry? - How?s the business going? - Fine, fine. - The bricklayers have work. Daniel only thinks about saving the world. Eat... and don?t talk with your mouth full. Since leaving his wife, he thinks he?s got younger. He never danced before. - Love makes people younger. - It?s not love, it?s sex. - What?s the difference? - The heart. We have a mind, a heart, but between them is sex. The blend makes people younger. You should try it to see if it works. Let?s go... Careful not to slip. Be careful... with the rain. Damn umbrella! Be careful! Taking a nap? No. I?m resting. I?m thinking. - Are you worried? - As always. Come on, my wet teddy bear. - Are you going to make it? - My exam? Yes, why? - Did you choose a faculty yet? - Yes. Law. - Like Sylvain? - Yes. - What if he doesn?t pass? - He knows more than me. Law is not that bad. Or Economics. We haven?t decided yet. Or Medical School. I think I understand. It?s essential you stay together. What if you stop loving him? Hail the loving couple! - What are we going to eat? - Stones with crushed rock sauce. Did you work the whole night? Go get changed. You?ll get cold. I?ll go. I finished the budget for Mrs Fauge?s pool. - You had time to finish it? - Yes. This morning. Do you want drink? A ?pastis?, dad? - What about you, Mum? - A strawberry juice, please. It can make you sick! Isn?t it boring to live with a woman like that? You?ll get fat. Not at my age. Go get changed. You?ll get sick. If I don?t pass and Sylvain doesn?t go, I?ll kill myself. Don?t say that. You?ll pass. I?m scared. - Hurry up. - Wait! Go! Don?t be late. I?m sorry. You?re making a phone call while driving? I?m okay. I?m working. It?s like an eternity! I want to see you. Some eternities last more than a week. I?m alone. You don?t understand. I don?t want to discuss that on the phone. Then come over here. I can?t today. - If you don?t come, I... - You what? I?ll jump from my balcony... naked. Don?t forget the towel to break the fall. I?m not joking. It?s too hard. I love you. I don?t know if I can... I don?t know if I can handle it. I?ve got to go. See you soon. I?m sorry. Once I was run over by a car because the guy was on the phone. - I can?t stay longer. I have to... - I know. You have to go. - I?d like to stay longer. - Yes, but you?re leaving. It?s easy for you. Easy! Do you think... I love you... and I love Daniel. - Do you think this is easy? - I didn?t mean that. I?m only happy when I make love. The rest of the time, I suffer. I keep thinking and suffering. Even if we were together, I?d suffer. If you think this is easy we should stop because... I?m sorry. I?ll wait... For what? I don?t expect anything. Let?s keep things the way they are. We?ll be engaged for eternity. I really like you, Marco. And I love you so much! For eternity. Yes. For eternity! I passed! I passed! And Sylvain? I don?t know. I didn?t see his name. I?ll go back. Hurry! Give me the bag. Have a nice vacation! Have fun! Be careful. Bye! Behave yourselves! Julie is leaving us, isn?t she? I?ve been thinking about this for a long time. I thought about... travelling to another place. Another work, other friends, different landscapes... I mean, another life. Another woman. Not that. I want to be with you forever. - Is something wrong? - No, it?s nothing. This tunnel. We always blow the horn when we drive through. Everybody used to do that, but now... After us, no one will blow the horn. I don?t know... It?s silly, but this makes me sad. If we stop, it can bring us bad luck. But if you want, I?ll stop. Do you want me to stop? No. You probably don?t like... to see the same things all the time. All the time, every day. You certainly would like to change, wouldn?t you? Wouldn?t you? Start all over. Start all over again. Do other work, new friends, new landscapes... - Another man. - Daniel! What? Nothing. Don?t change anything. You have no idea how hard it is for me to hide from you... that I am in love. Like a school girl. Like our daughter. I can?t tell you anything. Share anything with you. I have to keep everything to myself, I have to hide my feelings. I think that?s treachery. Betraying isn?t just going to bed with another man. It?s to live in silence, to keep things to yourself, not as a sin but as a joy that I?d like to share with you. I want to share everything with you. I love you. I love you both. Marseille-Building Company. Good morning. The company is on holiday until August 28th. See you soon. Belle-de-Mai Transport. Good morning. I forgot my mobile. What have you got? - I don?t know. - Let me see. I don?t see anything. Come in. It?s Marie-Jo. - Aren?t you taking a vacation? - No. I?ll just put a jacket on. I?m coming. Open the window if you want. Marc Naffret?s mobile. You can leave your message after the beep. I?m at Christophe?s house. I can see the island of Frioul from here. And I know you?re there. It was very nice seeing you. Did you say something? It?s a wonderful view. Do you still have that old shirt? So what? I?ll buy another one when this one?s old. Old! You mean that one isn?t old? This is in-between. You know the wine from M?m?? Don?t you? It?s from the vineyard of Granmenon. Cheers. Look, Marie-Jo, I know I?m an old boozer. But I chose to drink the best. I spent all my money on the best wines. And you?re killing yourself. To much wine is bad. It makes you sick. - Did you like it? - A lot. Sometimes in life you have to choose. I want you to tell me all you do when you?re not with me. I want to know your everyday gestures. So I?m with you when you go away. I can imagine you... All right. When I got here today, the gate was open. I drove in. I closed the gate. It creaks. It?s old. It was there when we bought the house. Daniel wanted a new one, but I didn?t. We?re used to its creak. I got the bags, that?s it. - More details! - How stupid! I carried them in. There was a trolley, but I didn?t use it. All those bags were hurting my hands. I made funny faces. I must have looked ugly. I dropped everything in front of the fridge from where I bent over and took 2 eggs and some other food. Continue. Then I felt Daniel?s hands on my arse, my belly, unbuttoning my pants. - What? - What? I didn?t say anything. How about going to Frioul? - Did you hear me? - When? Next weekend. The weather will be nice. We can invite Julie and Sylvain. It?s been a long time since I?ve been to Frioul. I?ll book a table at the restaurant. It might be a good idea today. I?ll call. Otherwise there may be no tables left. It?s not working. I?ll try from over there. You go to the beach. We?ll pretend we met each other by chance. Come on. Do that for me. Don?t you want to see me? So! Sometimes I meet clients on the streets of Marseilles. I want you to meet my husband and my daughter. What?s he doing? Why did you make me do that? I didn?t want to come. I won?t feel comfortable. Good morning. An old client. Marco works there. I have malaria crises quite often. I get very depressed and have to stay in hospital for 2 or 3 days. That?s where we met. She drives very well. Like to have lunch with us? I booked a table for four. We can be five. - Are you a pilot? - Yes. ...as people originate, live, marry, work, die... How they love each other, split, what they do every day... I wrote down dozens of those habits in a big notebook. In Bali, for instance, when the couple make love, after the orgasm, they congratulate each other. In Peru, some Indians wake up in the morning and if the weather is nice they bow before the landscape. Can I see this notebook? - Julie. - What? It probably has private things. I just asked. He doesn?t have to. - If you?re interested... - Yes. We learn things by travelling. Didn?t we go to Greece this year? And Quebec last year? Big deal! What about you? Let?s not just talk about me. Us! I live for my work and Marie-Jo for her patients. And just as Julie said... we don?t travel a lot and we don?t have much to tell. All over the world the questions are always almost the same. I know, but learning by travelling is more interesting. It takes the sea a thousand years to go around the world. Marco, the Monte D?0ro in 8 minutes. - I?ll send the longboat. - Ships never wait. No mornings, nights or Sundays. Excuse me. Don?t forget the coordinates. - You?re welcome anytime. - Thank you. Bye! See you in the next crisis. Keep it for me. We?re going in the water. - Are you going to swim? - That?s why we came here. See you on the beach. So? What do you think of him? Nice. I knew you?d like him. Otherwise, I wouldn?t introduce you. I could swim to Marseilles. - What? - I did it once. When you were 15. Today I?m 45. So I must swim three times faster... or not? Maybe I can even go further. - Or I could drown and die. - You?ll drown. We?ll see. You shouldn?t have run. Come on! What are you afraid of? I think we?re being used. It took us an hour to get here. We agreed I?d pay one day and you the next. But it?s not fair to make us pay. - Are you serious? - The boss must pay. Last year I earned 3,300 francs more than you. What do you think? That I?ve been stealing from you? You think I?m stealing from you? Go away! Get out of here! A two-hour strike. That?s not possible! The contracts, the patients? We can maintain the minimum. The schedule must change. - Another offense, no! - Enough. Didn?t you hear? In Nimes... What are you doing? Where are you going? We need you here. It?s open. I can stay for nearly two hours. Isn?t it good? - Are you mad at me? - No. Are you mad at me? What did you think of my daughter? And Sylvain? He?s nice, isn?t he? I thought I wouldn?t feel comfortable having lunch with you, but, no... I don?t know why. When you?re not with me, I?d rather think you don?t exist. I?m jealous of the time I don?t spend with you. In the tropics, after making love the lover pours coconut milk over the woman?s body. I want coconut milk. No! It?s too cold. Damn it! It?s Daniel. Daniel? Where are you? The connection is bad. How are you, Marco? I thought you were with the rest of the pilots. They already left? Long ago. The other group is arriving. Anything wrong? Sorry to bother you. - You?ll forget as time passes. - No, I wont. Do I deserve all this, Mrs Fauvelet? In another life, I?d have met Marie-Jo before him. She should be living with me. I?m in love for the first time. Even if I scream that I love her, who will listen to me? Dad, we need a shower. Your mum will see to that. Never mix business with family. Let?s do it together. Where? In the kitchen, where the cabinet is. We?ll have to change the water pipes. We can manage. I?ll think about it. My parents had our house renovated. My grandma didn?t want a shower. She washed herself in the sink. You said I could come by. I was in the neighbourhood. Am I disturbing you? - You came to pick up the notebook? - Yes, I did. Do you want a drink? - What have you got? - Alcoholic or non alcoholic? - Have you got whisky? - Sure. He manages apprenticeships. I don?t know if he graduated, so he became a manager. He earned a good money working at a apprenticeship centre. I think he was head of a branch. I don?t really know. He doesn?t really talk about his life. One day, he quit to start his business teaching young people who he thought were exploited. Many people give up. I don?t really know. But he trains them at his company. Some of them settle on their own. But not many. My mother drives an ambulance and takes care of the bookkeeping. When they offered her a job as driver, she accepted it. She studied hard to get her driver?s license. She started to work without it. But because she graduated in paramedics she didn?t have to cheat. My dad had just started his business. He had no money. He bought everything in instalments. He had a lot of debts. They bought a house too. - They weren?t young anymore. - When was that? About 10 years ago. Now things are better. But changing life like that... so suddenly. I admire them. They?re incredible. At parties they?re always the nicest couple. And when they dance together, it?s amazing. There?s harmony between them. Take good care of it. - I?ll bring it back to you in a week. - No problem. I?ll take good care of it. Thank you. Close the gate. Are you going out again? Are you going to work? I?m going out, but not to work. - Aren?t you going to ask? - Ask what? I?m not going to work. Julie called. They?re coming to take the cabinet. Marco... Marco and me are lovers. I love him. I can?t get him out of my mind. We?ve been having an affair for months. I love two men. I didn?t mean to, but it happened. I did everything so it was just an adventure. I never wanted this. Normally it?s not difficult to resist. I tried, but I failed. I love him... deeply. It all started a year ago. I thought I?d give it up, just like quitting cigarettes. That one day I?d get tired of him, but it didn?t happen. I didn?t get tired of him. I want more. I want to live under the same roof. I can?t carry on like this. I want to kiss him in public. I know it hurts. Forgive me! Forgive me! Aren?t you going to blow the horn? - Blow the horn! - Wait! Stop! This is so stupid! - Are you happy? - Yes... Mum isn?t here. We can?t surprise her. At least ring the bell. - This is my house. - Not anymore. - It?s our cabinet. - It?s a little bit dirty, but go on. Dad! Clean the cabinet. I?ll help you. The lock is stuck. Did anything happen to Mum? It?s Mum! What happened to her? Call her on the mobile. - What?s the number? - Dial 3. - Tell me what happened. - It?s ringing. Mum! What happened? Where are you? You can?t do that. You can?t! Stop calling me ?honey?. Come back! I don?t forgive you. You have no right to do that to Daddy. And stop crying! Aren?t you ashamed of crying? Come back home! That?s all! If you don?t, I never want to see you again. - Did she leave? - Yes. The bitch left. Who with? Who did she go with, Dad? Come on! Come on, let?s get her. - Don?t let her do this to you. - Take it easy! Take it easy, Julie. You can?t let her go to bed with another guy. We?re here talking while she?s in bed with someone. - Shut up! - Is that it, Dad? - Stop, Julie! - Where do you think she is? A guy took her from you, Dad. - Stop, damn it! - What do you think? She?s fucking another man, she?s in bed with him. Stop! He knows all that. Leave him alone! Mum! The pilot?s longboat! This is to tell you about the wind direction. This... you?ll see. Almost... I dreamt of this moment. - Which moment? - This. - What?s so special? - Nothing. We?ve seen each other more than a year... 4 times a week. 52 times 4 is 200. Two hundred times. - Wrong. - 208, to be exact. And the weeks you spend in Frioul? I thought about that. So every other week. That?s why I told you four and not eight. Did you go to bed many times with other men... except Daniel? - No. - Come on. Let?s try to stay like this another year. What are you doing? You?re crazy! You?re overreacting, Julie. This is between your father and Marie-Jo. You don?t know what happened, why she left. Why did she do that to me? I?d like to stay! - I know, I know... Let?s go. - A week goes by very fast. Where are you? Where are you? Down here. I knew you were watching me. I love you. I love you too. You don?t open the window today. You seem happy. - What did you say? - Happy! You seem happy. It?s ridiculous this word, ?seem?. ?Seem?... If you are, you are. You seem sad... You?re sad, or you?re not sad. I want exactness. Like the air. The air is nitrogen... a blend of hydrogen and oxygen... with a little bit of argon... a little neon... some helium and a tiny bit of krypton. There?s also a very, very small amount of xenon. And radon... Oh, radon! It?s so rare that it took centuries to discover it. Marie-Jo, a friend of yours came to pick me up twice for my dialysis. It seems that picking me up is some kind of trick, a special punishment for the new ones, like freshmen. You fall into the trap of the stinky old man. Do you really think I look happy? Yes. What is this? A present? It?s very beautiful. Do you want a beer? - Sorry? - Want a beer? Yes. - Here. - Thank you. Sorry, we only have this one. Is this right? Damn it! - It?s nothing. - I?m sorry. - It?s all right. - No, it?s not all right. This whole thing drives me nuts. I?m pissed off. Well, let?s do it all over again. There?s Jean-Pierre. How?s it going? All right. Eug?nio, our pension man. Congratulations. - Good morning, commander. - My respects, madam. - Are you okay? - Yes, very well. And you? Don?t you remember me? We met only twice. Mrs Fauvelet. Your husband built our house two years ago. I work with Marco in Frioul. I?m the governess. I didn?t see your husband. He?s not here. We?re divorced. We had to sell the house. It was a beautiful house. That?s life. Marco talks a lot about you. But I didn?t know it was you. I didn?t connect... I?m very happy for Marco. He?s a new man. He never made jokes before. It?s so nice to make a man happy. Don?t you think so? I don?t know. Marco is so... enthusiastic! Too much, I think. I?m not like that. I?m happy, but when I wake up, I feel like crying. But I can?t... I think about my husband. I can?t forget him. And Marco is so... happy. He wants to take me on a trip around the world. I?d love to... but I don?t want to stay away. Do you understand? You should go dancing, have a little fun. And try to forget... a little. Give me your glass. One... two... three... four... Seven? What are you going to do during these seven days? Nothing. I?ll stay in bed, I?ll sleep, dream about you... read, finish the romance I started to read 3 days ago. If they don?t call me to work, I?ll spend the day in bed. So, maybe I?ll stay in bed the whole week. What do you want me to do without you? I?m nothing without you. Without you, I get ill. I don?t dream anymore, I don?t smoke anymore, I don?t live anymore. Without you I?m alone, Without you I?m ugly, I?m like an orphan alone in a dormitory. I don?t feel like living my life anymore. My life has no meaning when you leave. I don?t live anymore. My bed becomes a park bench When you leave me I get ill! Really ill! Just like when my mother went out at night And left me alone with my despair, I?m sick. Truly sick. I don?t know when you?re coming back. You come and go and I never know where. It?s been like that the last 2 years and you just don?t care... Marie-Jo... Did you know you had 3 meetings today? Mrs Burle called. The lady with the vest. You didn?t call her. She?s furious. And you forgot Jean-Christophe. Go away. I?m expecting no one. Jean-Christoph, it?s Marie-Jo. Come in, Marie-Jo. Is today Thursday? I forgot about you. Make yourself at home... Sit down. - Don?t you want to? - No, thank you. I was walking... on the street... I didn?t know where to go. I didn?t know what to do. Then I thought... I should talk to you, Jean-Christophe. Someone who understands my story... It?s a beautiful story. Marie-Jo, you?re lovely. This colour really suits you. It looks good with your hair. I met a woman who had hair like yours. I remember... Yes, I remember. I like remembering a lot. And to help that, I drink. I don?t know why, but... wine helps us remember the past. You know... a sick old man?s day is boring. So I created a rule for myself, wait until night comes. I sit down, open a bottle and start to remember. Marie-Jo... You can?t suffocate me with your story. Keep it for later when it?s become just a memory. You?ll see, it will help you to live. It will help you as it helps me... to wait... to wait for the night to come. See you, Marie-Jo. The stars were coming out. The day was ending. I thought I should ring the bell. What are you doing? Come in. It?s cold. Should I close the gate? I love you. Who was it? Hello, Julie. - How are you, Sylvain? - Fine, thank you. Leave your briefcase there. I don?t feel like looking at your face. What did you come here for? Couldn?t you come when Daddy wasn?t here? Think he can see you and not suffer? - I came back. - He threw you out and you came back! Was it fun? Did you fuck a lot? Yes... it was nice with Marco. You make me sick. If it was so nice, why come back? - There was nothing I could do. - Yes, you could do something. What you did. You showed everybody you could do things differently. Now everybody knows someone fell in love with you. This makes you feel young again. But it doesn?t change the fact that you?re old and ugly. She came back to stay... until the next time. Right? Sylvain is waiting for you. He can wait! Aren?t you going to say anything? She abandons you, makes you suffer, comes back and you accept her with open arms. You?re old too... old and ugly. You?re disgusting too. You both make me sick. Yes, sick. This will pass. It needs patience... She doesn?t understand. Why? Do you understand? In an hour, okay? Not before. There?s a lot of traffic in that neighbourhood. Thank you, Carmelle. It?s all right. - You didn?t bring anything? - No. Follow me, please. You should have waited in your room. In the back, please. It?s against the rules to go in the front. - I wanted to kiss you. - Get in, please. Kiss me! You look pale. I?ve got to go. - Are you coming back? - Yes. I didn?t give you enough love. Don?t say that. We spent such a short time together! I love you, Marco. It?s very good. It tastes better with more pepper. If you put too much pepper, you can?t taste the real flavour. - Aren?t you eating, Marie-Jo? - Yes. It?s delicious. How is college? I?m so stupid. - Is it too hard, Sylvain? - Not really. What about you, Julie? How is college? If I don?t pass the final exams, we?ll be together next year. - That would be a pity. - We want to be together. Forgive me, Julie. I love your dad, I love Marco. What can I do? It?s not my fault. Your father suffers. Marco too. And you suffer as well. Sylvain must be tired of his mother-in-law?s nonsense. I?m tired of it too. I?d like to be happy too, serene... I?d like my daughter to look at me to say more than good morning and good night. I?d like only one man to satisfy my heart. When you love two men, it gets empty. Loving only one is stronger. Loving two men weakens it. You can?t imagine how much. I saw Marco again. I can?t live without him. What can we do? Did you remove my name? I?ll paint it again. I?m waiting for the stencil. You can use another name if you like. You should never change the name. It?s wrong. It brings bad luck. Listen... I can?t stand it anymore, Marie-Jo. I can?t stand it. I have terrible thoughts, horrible things in my head. Dirty thoughts. I repel myself. I wanted so much to accept... I hoped I could share you... I tried... I really tried. I know. I was ready to face everything if you?d stayed. My mind could accept it, but not my heart. I can?t. I love you. I?m not mad at you... at anybody. But I can?t... I can?t. - If Daniel died... - Shut up. I can?t stop thinking about it. I?ve met widows who suffered a lot with their husband?s death. Then they met other men and had the right to love again. I?ve never wished Daniel?s death. But this thought obsesses me. It?s terrible. Why? I don?t know. - Have a nice trip! - You too. - Where are we going? - I don?t know. You can take them. It?s your mother?s mobile. - What? - In there. Don?t hang up, Marco. It?s Julie. You needn?t call anymore. She?s dead! My father too. Both of them are dead!
