They don't feed you here, you know. People are going to think I'm anorexic. I've had 6 tests and a--hi, Morgan. How you doing? That's Morgan. Hello? Woman: Hello. Oh. Yo, Frankie. Hello? Hello? Hello. Morgan? Morgan, is that you? Mom! Hi, mom. Awfully sorry, darling. There's a change in our schedule. Your father and I have to tape the Phil donahue show, so I'm afraid we'll have to scratch Thanksgiving. Ok. Maybema, next year--you know, what's Thanksgiving? You sit around eating leftover Turkey for 4 days. Donahue people need a republican senator and his wife for a show on marital stress. But I'll see you at Christmas, right? Well, unfortunately, darling, politics demand we spend a week in The Bahamas. How come? How come? Your father needs a good rest. Oh, you're not too disappointed, are you? No. No, it's--it's-- I know daddy works hard. I know. Veryhard. I know. You have no idea, the stress and strain a senator endures. So, uh, so easter, right? Have you been eating meat? You sound depressed. You ok? Yeah. No, I'm really--i'm-- you sure? No, I'm fine. I really--i am. I'm ok. Well, ok. See you at easter. Yeah. Easter. Uh-huh. Looking forward to it. Definitely. Got to go. Ok. Happy Thanksgiving. Bye, mom.

We did it! We didn't do it. Me? Oh... How did it go? Bad. Real bad. Um, I'm going home. They can't do that. They can't just kick you out. No, no. They--they didn't kick me out. My, uh, my parents called Mr. Smythe this morning, and...they want me to come home. He got kicked out. This is all a desperate rationalization. Go ask Mr. Smythe yourself. It's the truth. They want me to come home and live with them. Yeah, but you've never really lived at home. Sure, I did. I lived at home till I was 10. It was great. But that was all 7 years ago. Well, sure, we've been a little out of touch but nothing that can't be remedied. Garrett, they called me. I did not call them. They want me to come home.

Ha ha! I'll be right back, ok? See you later, baby. I got to work. Oh, my god. You're not my son. No, ma'am. He's--he's taking a shower. ...hot water over there? Incoming! Oh. Boy, you ok? Morgan? Morgan? Hi. Mom? Morgan? Mom? Mom. Morgan? Mom! Morgan! You--you've-- y-you look good, mom! Mom. Mom. Uh... Sounds ethnic. Well, hurry up, dear. Pilot's waiting. Sorry, guys. Heh heh! Morgan: Mom, I'm real excited about going home. Uh, by the way, where do we live these days? Mom: Washington. We're always in Washington this time of year. Ahh, shit! Morgan, I'm off to the hairdresser's. Make yourself at home, darling. I'm home! [Echoing] Dad? Dad! I'm home! Dad... Whoa. Whoa! This must be where they keep the iguanas. Hello? Anybody home? [Tapping] Huh! Food processor! Damn you! No knife! [Speaking Russian] Oh! Look, is very easy. Ah! Ha ha ha! Beautiful, huh? No knife. You cavewoman. Cavewoman! We in america now! Free country! Huh! I smoke when I want and where I want. Hi. I'm Morgan. I think I live here. Oh. Ha ha! Welcome to the kitchen of your home, young master. Ahem! Allow me to interrupt myself. I am Ivan illych vinnikov. Hello, Ivan. Hello. And my wife, proskovia fyodorovna vinnikova. Huh? How you doing, proskovia? Uh, thank you. Uh, uh, perhaps the young master would like to be carried to his room? Sure. I don't see why not. Uh, certainly. If you would be so good, follow me. No. After you. Go ahead. Unh! Welcome! [Whistles] Well... It's definitely me. It's, uh... You know, I always wanted a cozy little room that could sleep 50. Because, you know, the rockettes usually stay with me when they're in town. There. At last. The ultimate den of iniquity-quity-quity... Ok... You guys go in the bathroom. Home is where the heart is. Ha ha! Hmm... Now, senator, there are many different ways to use this... Hey! I don't think oglethorpe's endorsement is going to make any difference-- senator! What--whoa! No! Wait! Hold it! Stop! It's ok. It's all right. Hi, dad. Gentlemen, this is my son. Oh...it's all right, hooks. Good work. How are you? I'm Jay. I'm the senator's new executive aide. I'm--i'm... I'm awfully sorry about this, but these are violent times, you know? It's ok. No harm done. I--i can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate your coming home. Well, I'm glad to be here, dad. Senator! It is telephone. Important. I'll be right there, Ivan. I'm awfully sorry-- it's ok. It's ok. We'll catch up later, ok? There's something different about you. I don't know what it is. Uh, well, I've grown about 4 inches since last time I saw you. I think that's it. [Jay laughing] Marshall... Uh, it's Morgan. Whatever. On behalf of the senator and the entire staff, I want to welcome you home. Great. This is a great house. Oh, thank you, thank you. I picked it out for 'em myself. How long have we lived here? We're going to cover that in the briefing, my boy. Briefing? Jay: Thelma daggett is a nationally acclaimed attorney, educator. She's a pioneer in the civil rights movement, she's been compared to Eleanor Roosevelt, mother Theresa, and Florence nightingale. Ha! Well... She sounds like she'd make a great senator. So would Santa claus and the tooth fairy. Um, no, Morgan. She's too good for office. She wouldn't fit in. There's no room in the senate for a goody-goody intellectual humanitarian. She'd stick out like a sore thumb. If I may continue, we're behind in the polls, Morgan. Now is the time for a new strategy. See, all we have to do is present the voters with a simple, obvious choice. A lonely, pathetic spinster... Or Tom Stewart, just your average American family man. Vote for the family. That's it. Now, that's exactly how we're going to win. That's your schedule. You'll represent the senator. You're our little ace in the hole, buddy. Mom: I've been thinking about your political future, Morgan. Mom, I'm not even old enough to vote yet. Yet you're old enough to date... The right girls, of course. I don't know. I hear the wrong girls can be a lot of fun. [Suppresses laugh] You see, mom, people just--people just don't date anymore. They just--you know, they go out to the movies, and then they sleep together. Oh, please. Spare me your locker-room humor, both of you. The right woman can make or break a man's political career, so your dating the right girl can make a crucial difference to your father's campaign as well as proving a valuable asset to your future. That's true, you know. I always wanted a girl with a good asset. [Fakes cough] Women hold the slender thread that all civilization hangs from. They lead men to greatness. I have just the girl for you. Good. Good. I, uh... I can't wait to meet her. Be sure to smile. Wait,here's wait--your shot-- look this way, sir! This way, senator! Isn't it unusual that an incumbent like yourself should be this far behind in the polls this early in the game? As I recall, Dewey had Truman beat in all the polls, but Truman still got elected. Then you're not concerned by Thelma daggett's popularity? I'm going to make my stand on the American family because I believe that's the most important issue we've got. Thank you. [Reporters clamoring] Thank you very much. Excuse US, folks. They're Denver oil money, they're moral majority, and their support will mean a great deal to the campaign. Now, that's their daughter Heather, the one I was telling you about. Don't forget to smile. Hello. How are you? Good to see you again. Oh, Heather, you're looking beautiful. This is my son Morgan. Hi. Jules, there's a rumor afloat you may be on the wrong team, my friend. Chlorine and ultraviolet rays age you terribly. But then, I've always been fascinated by skin care. What are your interests, Morgan? Um... Uh, I was dropped on my head as a baby. Since then, I've pretty much lost interest in just about everything. Oh...that's sad. I have too many interests-- the young Republicans... I have 9 different third-world pen pals, and I just organized a "say no" chapter at school. It's to help teenagers say no to premarital sex. You'd be amazed at how kids just can't say no. Send me all the literature you have on that subject. Mom: Oh, here he is. Over here, Morgan. Yes, I'd like you to meet our son Morgan. I don't believe it, darling! You're simply too young to be the mother of such a darling young man. How old are you, Morton? Uh, Morgan-- he just turned 12. Just a baby! Mom: If you don't stop disappearing, I'll have to put a cowbell around your neck. What's that? Meat! You're eating meat! Don't eat meat! But I'm hungry. Well, why not eat some drano or rat poison? Do you know what meat does to your body? Little globs of putrid fat choking your arteries. Flecks of gristle trapped between your teeth. Stringy, smelly chunks of dead flesh rotting out your lower tract. Christ, Morgan, don't you see what eating meat does to your complexion-- yoo-hoo! Hello, Sylvia! Mom, everybody has zits when they're my age. Well, we'll have to do something about that, won't we? Hello, Sylvia! I, uh, how are you? Oh, it's so nice to see you again! Thanks for coming by. Oh, ho! Hi! Hi. Try acting like you're having a good time, sport. Ok. Mom: Isn't Heather a Saint? Morgan: Oh, yeah, she's a real Joan of arc. Somebody ought to tie her to a stake and set her on fire. No! Look at this. What? This man actually hopped around the world on one foot. You know what's wrong with peoplemagazine? We've never been on the cover. Jay says we have to wait for them to come to US. He says if we go to them, it's a guaranteed hatchet job. Um, not necessarily. I had a nice little discussion with bill whitewood this evening. You are amazing. [Door opens] All my stuff is gone. What stuff? Oh, some pornographic film posters, I suppose. I had Ivan remove them. Mom, horror films are not pornographic. Where are they? In the incinerator by now. Oh, no--mom, they were mine! Mom, it took me years to collect them. I don't believe this! Now don't get so emotional. There are members of the press trotting through this house all the time, and I will not have that expensively decorated bedroom turned into a Times Square subway station. But it's my room! Yourroom? No, no, no, son. Don't you see? Your room is your room the way our room is our room, but in a wider sense, our house...Is... Our house. And you are a guest! I'm not a guest! I'm your son, for crying out loud! I mean, if we're going to pretend to be a family, we might as well take advantage of the situation. Now wait. Just one moment, please. Now, I know it's trendy and all that, but I don't subscribe to the buddy-buddy school of parenthood. I'm not a pal. I'm a mother. Good night, Morgan. I can't believe this! I'm an orphan with parents! We are going to be a family if it kills me. Things are going to change around here. Marsha Brady on TV: Well, you heard him tell her what a great job we were doing taking care of the house so she wouldn't worry and come home. Greg: That's right. No, it's wrong. We're doing a terrible job. We're trying, but we're not trying together. Charge! [Laugh track plays] Mike: Ok. Once again, kids, I've called a-- a late-evening meeting, but this time, it's not for a medical bulletin or to lecture you about carelessness. It's to tell you how proud, how pleased I am... Of course. It's so obvious. Greg: We're glad you're pleased, dad, 'cause we really tried. See here? Look. "Surgeon general" encourages all American comrades to smoke a lot. Huh! You won't take time to learn English. Then you must suffer in ignorance. I don't fart! Ah? Wait. You wait. I become real estate tycoon, divorce you, and marry beautiful stewardess. Oh! How you doing? [Cigarette fizzles] [Doorbell chimes] I come. I come. You can't get good help. Let's go! I come. I come. [Muttering in Russian] Aah! [Crash] I told them not to hire that Russian. Ohh! Morgan, what on earth is going on down there? Oh, I was just doing-- whoaaah! The floor. Just doing what to the floor? Uh...uh, waxing it a little. I want you at that breakfast table in 20... Make that 18 minutes. And dressed properly. Not like a psychedelic crop duster. Ok? Ok. Does anybody know I'm out here?! Uh, what? Oh, no, thanks, Ivan. Save it. I'm, uh, I'm sorry about the floor, Ivan. It's ok. Mmm! Looks good. Hey, dad, uh... I was thinking about, uh, getting a couple of tickets to the redskins game. Oh, I don't know, Morgan, I'm very, very busy. Actually, we could get some very nice media mileage out of that. Father and son rootin' for the home team. Nancy: Fix it, Jay. Jay: I'll take care of it right away. Nancy: No, I know, but listen, Marjorie, what's been bothering me all day is should I seat the Websters on the right or on the left? Mm-hmm. Well, no, I'd like to insult them, but I don't want to alienate them. Oh, yes, Jay. I'm trying to find Morgan. I need him to sign something from the bank. Well, he's probably upstairs performing an autopsy or something. Can you hang on a minute, Marjorie, please? Thanks. Morgan! Where are you? Yes, Marjorie. Now, what is this?Oh, god. I cannot tell you the problems I'm having. What areyou doing? I was just doing the windows. Pretty good idea, huh? No. Come on in. Jay wants you to sign something. I'm sorry, Marjorie. Oh, you think I should seat them on the right, then tell them it was a mistake and have them move to the left? No, look, stewarts do not do chores. We most assuredly do not do windows. Just stop sneaking around like a hyperactive handyman. Yeah. No, no, I was talking to my son. Yeah. No, he just keeps doing these things to help. Oh, he must get it from his father's side of the family. Uh, what is this? I've opened a safe deposit box in your name at throckmorton trust to keep the silver-dollar collection your aunt Matilda left you in her will. Well, I didn't know aunt Matilda died. I didn't even know aunt Matilda. Mm-hmm. But, uh, how many did she collect? I don't know. About 500 or so, I think. This is for your own protection, Morgan. Your mother thought it was a good idea. Right here. Ok. Ah, thank you. Nancy, I need you to sign this, too, to certify you as legal guardian. No, I know. We were going to have the soybean tartare. Uh-huh. With a marsala sauce. A Greek thing, maybe. No, I think it's grace. Well, whatever it was really... Uh, Jay. Yes? Uh, where's the key? What key? To the safety deposit box. I mean, considering that it's my silver-dollar collection, don't you think I should have the key? Oh-ho-ho, please! What's the matter, you don't trust me? Hey! Hey! I'm your uncle Jay, kid. Here. Wait a minute. On second thought, maybe I better hang onto this. I'm not sure you can handle the responsibility. You want the key? It's right here in my vest pocket anytime you need it. Well, Jay... What are you wearing now?! Oh, not you, Marjorie. Sorry. Morgan. Now I want you to go into town with Ivan and purchase some suitable clothing. And no more chores. If I'd wanted a servant for a son, I'd have had sex with the chauffeur. [Laughing] Sorry, dear. Where were we? No, I did not invite her. Oh, that's all I need-- some divorced actress in heat prancing around in a sarong made of saran wrap. [Rock music plays] Ivan: You clean the house good. Madame pleased, yes? No, madam not pleased. One day soon, I be building and selling condos. Big profits. In Russia, no real estate opportunities. Maybe you want to invest a little something? Oh, I don't know, Ivan. I make you partner. I'll think about it. [Children all talking at once] Christmas. Great concept. You got one hour. Meet me at the car. Ok. P.A.: Attention, shoppers, get George romero's autograph at waldenbooks. Meet the creator of the living dead, film director George romero live, in person, at waldenbooks on the south concourse. You been waiting here long? I can't believe he's here. P.A.: Attention, shoppers, get George romero's autograph at waldenbooks. Meet the creator of the living dead, film director George romero live, in person, at waldenbooks on the south concourse. Hey! Sorry I'm late. Man: Hey, come on. The line starts back there. Uh, sh--uh, she's with-- she's with me, mister. Thanks a lot. Oh, uh, no problem. Uh, it happens to me all the time. I don't mean to pry, but, uh, uh, do I know you? Uh, I don't think so. What's your name? Uh, Morgan. What's yours? Uh, Emily. You can call me m. You know, like dial m for murder. You know, that's, uh, that's one of my favorites. Did you know it was the only Hitchcock film ever made in 3-d? Yeah. Yeah. I--i knew that. Morgan: ...Shopping mall, so you'd have a hard time knowing the difference between the living dead and your average Christmas shopper. Yeah! What a comparison, though. Oh, but you know what my favorite was? Which one? Night of the living dead. That's the best one. That's definitely the best one. Well, that was the original. It was in black and white. I love black and white. I adore black and white! Isn't it the best?! It's the best. Horror films are definitely the purest form of cinema! Horror films are so pure. I love horror films! They are the best! This is so funny. I was exactly thinking that. I cannot believe-- hey! Watch it, man! Sorry. I, uh... Oh, uh, where's his head? I'm, uh... That's just really a demeaning question. It's my turn, it's my turn. Take this. Sir, here you go. Uh, so, anyway, i--i was just wondering if there might be some way for US to maybe get together sometime? You--you mean like a date? Well, not necessarily a date. Just, well, a date. Sure. You have a car? Uh, yeah, sure. Uh-huh. Well, cool. Well, um, I was planning on going to a late show of attack of the killer tomatoestonight. You wanna go? Sure. Sure. What about your folks? Oh, well, they trust me. It's cool. But if it's not cool with you, it's ok. We can do it another night. No, I'm real close to my parents. We're like this. So I guess, uh, I guess I'll pick you up, right? Yeah, you can pick me up around 8:00 at my house. You can have dinner with US. I'll tell my mom. She'd love to have you, really. Oh, great, um... Does--does your family eat meat? Yeah. Every night. Oh, great.

[Sighs] Dad's joined the ranks of the political undead, and sometimes my mother acts like I'm a sperm who chewed through her diaphragm like a piranha fish just to destroy her life. I see, then--then you're trying to get back at them. No, I just want to be close. Look, I know that washing the windows and doing the floors isn't gonna make any difference, i-- just maybe they'll get the message. In all honesty, Morgan, I don't see how you're going to get your message across by... Talking to yourself, pretending to be a servant, collecting pornographic film posters, and... Giving spontaneous dance recitals. Oh, god. Look, doc, ok. I'm... I'm gonna level with you. Ok, I have been doing drugs. I understand. I'm glad you told me, Morgan. For your sake, I'm glad. Now exactly what kind of drugs? I've been freebasing clearasil. To a large extent, Morgan's violent mood shifts, his bouts of irrationality, the paranoia, his persecution complex, can all be attributed to adolescence. Thank you, doctor. Well, isn't there some kind of hormone shot you could give him? I'm afraid not. There's no known cure for puberty. Good-bye, senator. Tom: It's good to have Morgan home. It's as if we really were a family now. Oh, I don't know, Tom. He worries me. He seems so eager for affection. Maybe I should've breast-fed him when he was an infant. What are you talking about? Breast-feeding. Very chic nowadays. They say it helps create some sort of affectionate bond between mother and child. Maybe I didn't cuddle Morgan enough. Maybe that's why he's so needy now. Well, maybe we sent him off to boarding school too early. Well, I went to boarding school when I was 5. I wasn't breast-fed. I didn't see my parents till I was 6 months old. They took this extended tour of Europe to recover from my birth. Mother felt she deserved it. And I turned out just fine. Oh, good lord. Too much hugging and kissing could cripple a child.

Keep your skis parallel and your feet together. Ok, ok. And use your hips for balance. Mobility. And mobility. And use the sticks to push along. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I watch the Olympics. Ok, ready? You don't have to go down. Just watch. Shoo, shoo, shoo. The sound effects is it. Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo. Try it. Come on. Ok, ok, ok. Shoo. Right? Yeah. Shoo, shoo. Oh, I'm getting it. You've got the hang of it. You're better than I am. Downhill racer. Shoo, shoo. Shoo, shoo, shoo. Ahem. Good evening, officer. Cross-country. Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo. Shoo, shoo. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Ha ha. Oh, my god. Keys. Do you wanna come in? Oh, I'd love to, but, uh... I got to get home. Well, um, I really had a great time. So did I. So did I. I--i had a great time. And I was wondering if maybe we could do it another time. If I'm going too fast for you, forget it. Tomorrow night? Great. Yeah? Great. Wait, um, pen. Hand, please. Ok, um... Ok, that's my phone number. You'll call me? Ok.yeah. Ok. Um... Good night. Good evening, senator Stewart. Good evening, officer. Come in. Is there something wrong? Evening, ma'am. Good evening. Sorry to have to wake you like this, senator Stewart, Mrs. Stewart, but we got a report earlier this evening that your car was stolen. Probably just a prank. Sounded like a young kid on the phone. [Bang] [Siren] Oh, shit. You, turn around. Put your hands on the car. Gimme your left hand. Morgan?! Uh, hi, mom. Hi, dad. Uh, you didn't have to wait up for me. Morgan, let me give you the facts. Sometimes children are a liability in politics. Look at all these Washington brats. Take your pick. Nothing but drugs, sex, automobile accidents, Hollywood parties, ad nauseum. And I will not have the son of my candidate sniffing cocaine or knocking up starlets or being a guest host on Saturday night live. Ok, I know it was dumb. I shouldn't have taken the car, and I'm sorry, ok? Well, it's not the end of the world. Oh, sure, go ahead, encourage him. Maybe tomorrow night he can steal the rolls. You, young man, are hereby grounded until further notice. You are not permitted to leave this house, even if it's on fire. Understood? Yes, mother. Well, good. I'm finally going to bed. [Power drill runs] What? What? Oh, sorry, champ. Just trying to earn a living. Could you do me a favor, please? Hand me those wire cutters right down there. Gimme a hand. What are you putting up in there? This sucker here. State of the art. Saticon tube. 6 to 1 zoom. Just about see in the dark. You better watch your pud polishing, if you catch my drift. "Pud polishing." [Laughter] Now, that speech-- Nancy, that is gonna make or break the entire campaign. I'm gonna have live television, live radio coverage. Everybody in this state is either gonna be watching or listening as the senator talks to a small, intimate group of friends and supporters and family. What would you say, about 200 people or so? That's terrific, Jay. Thank you. They'll all come to the home, have a little Christmas cheer. Put everybody in the spirit of giving, you mean. Mom, I have to talk to you. That's a great inspiration right there. The spirit of giving. Mom, it's real important. You gotta let me off restriction tonight. Oh, no. Mom, I promised somebody very important that I'd see them. I'm sorry about the car, ok, but I'll pay for the damages myself. How do you propose to do that, hold up a 7-Eleven? [Snickers] Well, I'll go to my safety deposit box and take out aunt Matilda's coin collection. Absolutely not. I don't think that's a very good idea. Why not? I know that your aunt would have wanted you to save that for college, something more substantial. Then I'll get a job. I'll work at a McDonald's or a gas station or something. McDonald's? Over my dead, withered, decomposed body. Fantastic job, Jay. Mom... No. You will stay on restriction tonight, tomorrow night, and for the rest of your young life. Elephants and mothers, Morgan, never forget. Now bear down, will ya, kid? No, it's ok, Ivan. It's just me. Hi. How you doin'? I say that right? Oh, yeah, yeah. Perfect. Thank you. How I'm doin'? For starters, I've been grounded for life. There are TV cameras all over the house watching my every move. And I can't even make a phone call without the whole world knowing about it. Huh. It sounds like Russia. Huh. [Telephone rings] Hello. It's me Morgan. Perfect timing. I was just on my way to work. What's up? Emily, I, uh, I don't think I'm gonna be able to see you tonight. Actually, I don't think I'm gonna be able to see you for a long time. Why? What's going on? [Sighs] My mother. I'm gr-- my mother's father. Uh, my grandfather. It's his heart, you know, it's, uh... It's broken. Anyway, I think i'm gonna have to go away for a long time. Well, um, when are you leaving? Can I see you before you go? Uh, uh, no, I don't-- I don't think so. I'm gonna be... I'm gonna be real busy. Are you ok? I mean, you sound a little bit weirded out or something. Oh, no, no, everything's great. I'm just a little worried, that's all. So, uh, watch out for those killer tomatoes, will you? [Dial tone] Mind if I join you? Don't worry. I wont tell if you won't. [Chuckles] It's a deal. So, uh, when did mom get on this vegetarian kick, anyway? About 6 months ago. She went to see this holistic manicurist who told her that eating meat had given her the fingernails of a 90-year-old woman. That was it. No more meat in the house period. God, when mom gets her mind set on something... Mother's not the easiest person in the world to live with. But... We wouldn't be where we are without her. Where exactly are we? Son, we're in the senate. The United States senate. Dad, you know... This is the first sandwich we've shared since before I went to school. I mean, before you even ran for office. Don't you remember the football games we used to go to? The cabin in the country where you taught me how to ski. I mean, we used to go up there every weekend. Just you, me and mom. I mean, I thought we were pretty happy then. I don't know, morg. I think we're pretty happy now. Yeah. That's just what I thought. Hey. Aren't you supposed to be grounded? Yeah. Better get back to my cell. Dad... I'm really glad things worked out so well for you. Thank you, son. Oh, come in, Morgan. Hi, mom. Uh, I was, uh-- don't tell me, darling. I know what happened. There was a spaceship that landed with little green men in it, and they attacked you with hatchets, and then they sucked you out of the house through the mail slot, and then they beamed you back again. It's a good try. It's a good try. They actually sucked me out through the doggy door, but you were very close. Very close. This is not funny, Morgan. [Knocking on door] Ivan, where'd you put my-- hey, dude. What's going on? Uh, nothing. How did you get in? I rang the doorbell and some guy answered it. Happens all the time. I didn't really understand him, but on the way up, I think he tried to sell me a condo. That's Ivan. You want to know how I found you? Washington's a small town. This is a really, really great house. How's your grandfather? Your grandfather? Oh. I'm sorry, uh, he's a little better. That's good. Um, well I really just came by to say, you know, hi and good-bye. I thought we were gonna go skiing sometime, but when you called me yesterday, I just-- it just didn't look like it was ever going to happen. So... Good-bye, Morgan. Emily. Are your folks home? Uh, no. Actually, they're out. Do you have any food? Yeah. Uh, sorry, this is all I could find. Anything. It's food. I'm starving. So you're pretty rich, huh? They are. I'm not. All I have is 500 silver dollars in a coin collection that my aunt left me. You see, my mom's dad was a big, uh... I mean, is, a big robber-baron type. What's he into? Oh, all sorts of things. This is really good. What is it? Dog food, mainly. Oh, oh, no, no. That's my--that's my mom's eggplant. Uh, dog food is, uh, how my mom's dad made all his money. You see, I'm supposed to say that the family fortune came from horses. You know, like tallyho and off to the races and all that crap. Well, the only horses my family ever owned were the ones that they chopped up and put in little cans. Ew. See, my mom's real into making the right impression, and she's real hard to understand sometimes. Oh, anyway you look at it, I mean, raising parents is a drag. Especially mothers. I mean, it's taken me 16 years of Patience, understanding, a whole lot of screaming and yelling, I mean, just to get her where she is now. Probably take me a whole 'nother 16 years just to get it right. But it's worth it. Whoa. Oh! Whoa! Smooth move! Oh, my god. Whoo! You look good in water. Oh, my god. I don't believe this. Hey, takes a licking, keeps on ticking. I'm so wet. Oh, it's cold out here. Come on. Come on. Ok, I'm coming. I'm freezing. I'm freezing. Oh, that's the stupidest thing that's ever happened to me in my entire life. Ooh, I'm freezing. Jesus Christ, my toes are the same color as your uniform. Oh, I can't even feel my toes. Good thing we went to the great expense of having the pool heated. You could have told me that. You didn't have to push me in. I'm gonna take a shower. What are you gonna do, just stand there and catch pneumonia? [Hums] Thank you, god. Thank you, god. Aah! Out of my way. I need a shampoo. [Shower water runs] Need a shampoo? Well, here comes Jorge your transylvanian hairdresser. [Heavy breathing] This is terrific. Oh, I gotta-- [psychotheme plays] And you never actually see the knife touch Janet Leigh's body. You know what? It took Hitchcock 7 days to shoot that shower scene. And it's only on film for, like, 3 seconds. You like that part where she screamed and the violins came in? Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Mom--mom, close the curtains. Introduce me please, Morgan. Mom. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Nancy Stewart. And whoever you are, you have precisely 60 seconds to get out of this house before I call the vice squad. Em-Emily, I'm sorry. Morgan! Emily! Morgan! Emily! Morgan! Emily! Morgan! Emily! Emily, come back. Emily! Morgan! Morgan, come back here right now! Morgan! Morgan! Don't you dare. Emily! Emily, wait! Damn. Hi, mom. Mrs. Whitewood, how are you? Mr. Whitewood, looking good. Oh, uh, how's Heather? Yeah. Ok. Oh, tilly, I tell you, these progressive schools. Who says Republicans don't know how to have fun, huh? Ha ha. Morgan! Morgan, I simply do not understand this behavior. Tonight I have suffered the worst humiliation of my entire life. You leave me with only 2 words to say... Military school. Well, I'm not going! Oh, yes, you are. And I know just the place. My old Alma mater, milhouse military academy. You're the only mistake I made in this campaign, Morgan. Maybe milhouse can make a man out of you. Please, Jay, don't make me go. Talk to mom. You're the only one who can convince her to let me stay. I'll change. I know you don't like me, but I'll change, ok? I'll do anything. Anything you want. You want me to take out Heather? I'll even take out Heather. Oh, you're gonna like general fenton. [Laughs] He knows how to deal with brats like you. Jay, please. Thanks, Jay. [Door locks] [Doorbell rings] General fenton. Oh, it's been so long. Jay, it's good to see you, my boy. I'm glad you're here. Come right in, please, sir.Thank you. Come right in, gentlemen, cadets, soldiers. Yes, sir. Whoo. As my boy Jay knows from firsthand experience-- oh, by the way, Jay, how long has it been? Oh, that was the, uh... That was the class of '64, sir. The class of '64. Oh, that was a class. Yes, sir. But, you see, at milhouse we hate failure. We eradicate failure. We rip it out by the roots. When I get through with your son, he'll be capable of defeating any enemy, any time, any place, be it foreign or domestic. Nancy: Morgan is on a strict vegetarian diet. He's not to eat meat under any circumstances. [Buzzing] The problems you're facing with your son are problems we face every day at milhouse. Let me assure you, I mean...[Buzzing] We have a trained staff of professionally trained people who handle this all the time. So I can assure you there's nothing out of the ordinary... We apply the right approach. You may feel that it's old-fashioned, but it works. I would say that this is not a problem. Let's go, men. Oh, good. Glad to see you're packed. General fenton is here. Wrong way. Morgan! Oh, god! Oh, my god! Morgan! Morgan! Tom: Morgan! Morgan, don't you dare go down there! Morgan, you'll hurt yourself! Oh, my god, Tom, look what he's doing! Damn it! Morgan!He's getting away! God damn it, do something, general! Get him! ♪ Lord if I won't die ♪ dead and gone ♪ gone ♪ gone ♪ keep on riding ♪ keep on riding [Knocking on door] Emily, it's me Morgan. There's nobody home. Oh, come on, Emily. I-I'm sorry. You lied to me. All that stuff about your parents being so cool. You probably don't even have a grandfather. Ok, I shouldn't have lied. Then why did you? 'Cause the truth sucks. 'Cause my parents and I are strangers. We just have the same last name. I was shipped off to boarding school when I was 10. And I was dumb enough to think if I could get myself kicked out enough times that eventually they'd run out of schools and have to take me home. You know what really sucks is... They never did. I went through 8 schools in 6 years. Then all of a sudden, they call me up. They said they wanted me to come home. It was a joke. They didn't want me. They wanted a cardboard cutout labeled "kid" for their campaign poster. I used to pray that my dad would resign or lose the election. Now I don't even care. So, uh... So what I came for was to... To say good-bye, 'cause I'm leaving. I'm running away. Can I drive you somewhere? Senator, I need to speak to you. Not now, Jay. They're checking all the hospitals, halfway houses, the morgues. I'm expecting 200 guests for a festive press conference. I'm getting a migraine. He's probably just gone off somewhere to work out his problems. This whole idea about military school is a terrible mistake. Uh, senator... Jay, can't it wait? No, I'm afraid it can't, sir. Oh, Jay, really, you should know better. Oh, that's right, that's right. You don't like smoking in the house. I'm awfully sorry. But, uh, under the circumstances... Under what circumstances? Emily: What are we doing here anyway? What do you usually do at banks? You get dollars. Well, can't you write a check or something? No, because our old pal Jay decided that aunt mathilda's coin collection would be better off in a safe deposit box. Look, instead of running away, you can just come stay at our house. I mean, my parents loved you. Oh, great, I can bunk with Billy. Ok, scratch that idea. I guess it's your life and you know what you're doing with it. I can show you to the vault now, Mr. Stewart. Please sign here. Thank you. [Whistles] Holy shit. Maybe they compounded the interest. In my pocket, I have the key to Morgan's safe deposit box in which I have placed $500,000 in marked $100 bills... From your campaign fund. The box also contains the records of how the contributions were laundered. All of which were co-signed and authorized by Nancy and Morgan Stewart. I must say, senator, you have some family. I mean, they couldn't have been more help to me if they'd been part of the scam themselves. Did you sign something for Jay? God, Tom, you know, I sign things all the time-- did youjay has been sign this?Running this campaign for US. I'm given... [Telephone rings] I can't begin to read each and every word. This is senator Stewart's office. Man on telephone: It's ernemann. Ah, yes, yes. I'll take care of that. One second, please. Excuse me, folks. Minor detail. [Door closes] I'm sorry. We have to find out what happened. Yeah. Now listen, first of all-- we got big trouble. It's an emergency. The Stewart boy came in here and cleared out the safe deposit box. Jay, he had the key. What--what do you mean had the key? That's impossible. I got the key right here. Why didn't you stop him, you idiot? I had my own receipt book in there along with the money. I just got back from my lunch hour. Jay, you know I'm hypoglycemic and have to eat precisely at noon. I don't think they care very much about that in prison, ernemann. And that's exactly where we're gonna be if you don't get that money and those files back! Well, you don't have to shout. You fruitcake. The same to you and your mother. What? Here are the whitewoods. They're all here. All the names of the contributors and receipts for all the contributions to my father's campaign. I hate to say this, but it looks like your parents are pulling a scam. Well, my family has plenty of money. And besides, it's too late in the campaign to use any of this stuff. My family may be a lot of things. They are not crooks. No, this has to be Jay. He had the key to the safe deposit box, and these receipts are not in my dad's handwriting. But why? I cannot figure that out. I mean, if this got out, it could ruin my dad, especially right now. Well, I don't see why you're getting so bummed out. I mean, if you look at it, it's kind of what you wanted, right? I mean, your dad getting out of politics. No, not this way. Listen, I gotta make a stop, but come on. Where are we going? I'm going home. I'll make it very simple for you, senator. Tonight, while the entire state of Virginia watches and listens, you're going to very quietly and with great dignity withdraw from the race. Is this some kind of joke? Wishful thinking, senator. First, we leak news of the missing money to the press. Then a photostatted copy of the bank document opening the account will be mailed anonymously. Do you want me to go on? Why are you doing this? Well, it all comes down to money, senator. And I'm afraid the other side pays more. Now, I think you both should get dressed for the party. All your lovely guests will be arriving soon. Morgan: Roadblock. Pull over, pull over. Go ahead, sir. Maybe we should come back another time. Your mother can't really handle surprises. No shit. Ok, give me your jacket and your glasses. And all I got to do is get to my dad before the press conference. I can't believe you're doing this. I know it's feeble, but it's all they had. And all it's got to do is get me past the cadets. General, he is a dangerous psychopath. Now, we're talking about a sick thief. He's a threat to his own father's life. Now, he has to be kept away from here, has to be kept away from the senator at all costs. You hear that? I'll take care of him. Believe me. That boy humiliated me, Jay. I can't stomach that. I hate punks. I'd like to grab 'em by the ears and puke in their faces. That's why I knew you were the right man for this job, sir. Damn right, Jay. Cadets, 10-hut. Detail ready for inspection, sir. Thank you, captain. We're up against a slimy little turd. And we're gonna get him, aren't we, boys? Cadets: Yes, sir! Now, what were you before you came to milhouse military academy? Cadets: Scum, sir! What kind of scum? Dope-smoking, foul-talking, rock 'n' roll pervert scum, sir! And what are you now? Good little boys, sir! You haven't lost your touch, general. Thank you, Jay. Captain, you can deploy the men. Captain: To your posts, gentlemen. [Cadets shouting] Uh, mister, excuse me. Sure. I am buying some land in Florida. The everglades. You know it maybe? Oh, it lookslook up lovely.There. Uh-huh. Oh. Believe me, Steve, the senator is very aware of your generosity. And, uh, he just has to play it a little cool at the moment, you understand? Loose lips sink ships. But when the time is right, you can be sure he'll be showing his gratitude. To hell with gratitude, Jay. You just make sure that highway bill gets out of committee in one piece. Hey, Steve, don't sweat it, my friend. No problem. That's good little boys. Now remember. Keep a sharp eye out for him. Ok, let's move out. Cadets: Yes, sir! All posts on full alert. All posts on full alert. Oh, Tom. How could I have been so stupid? Tom, for god's sake. You are a United States senator. We'll fight this with everything we've got. Now, Jay can't possibly get away with this. He may not need to. Well, what do you mean? If we fight back, Jay will just stoop even lower than he already has. We've allowed him to get close to so many people in our lives, the fallout's gonna be devastating. Well, there goes the cover of people. Who cares? We'll fight him, Tom. On the beaches, in the air, on the land, on the sea. Together we can beat him. Together we hired a sleazy, cheap con man because we thought he had street smarts, huh? Some street smarts. We've been so desperately afraid of losing, we've already lost. We've lost our dignity, we've lost our self-respect. We've lost our son. Let's go downstairs. Well, whatever you decide, senator Stewart, just look to your right because I'll be standing there. Morgan, there you are. I'm so glad you could make it. Oh, a present for me? You really shouldn't have. Now, I'm awfully sorry that you're gonna have to miss seeing your father withdraw from the race. Actually, I wrote the speech. It's really quite touching. Take him away, boys. Hey, Morgan, want a ride? Come on. Get on! What great timing. Ow! Hey! A fox is in the chicken Coop. Alpha-Charlie to base. Alpha-Charlie to base. Come in. Yes, sir. He won't get by me, sir. All right, let's go. Head him off at the back! Let's go. Geronimo! My fellow virginians, it is with a heavy heart and a great deal of regret that I stand before you this afternoon. Oh, no. Oh, shit. Hold on. Move it. Come on! Halt! Oh, my god. We've got 'em now. Wait a minute. Wait. Stop the Jeep! Stop the Jeep! Aah! Oh, they think they're getting away, huh? Let me out of this. They tried this in Berlin in '45. Oh, oh. Morgan: Oh, my god. Jay: This damn thing doesn't have seat belts. Seat belts? Jay:Emily: Watch it!Look out! Watch it, you goddamned idiot! You're speaking to a superior officer. All right, you're an idiot, sir. Now that's better. Jay: Where in the hell are they going?! Coming through. My god, it's Morgan. Dad, catch! Read the receipt book. We got Jay by the short hairs. Morgan, hold on. Excuse me. Oh... Shit! Get out of the way! Out of the way! Come on, general! After him! Oh, shit! Go! Go! Emily: We're cut off. Left turn. Jay: Wait, wait! What are you doing? Wait, you crazy bastard! General: Ha ha ha. This is living. Jesus Christ, fenton! General, you're an asshole! Now what the hell is go-- put the brakes on! Aah! Aah! Oh, my god, Tom. Oh, god. General, you're a-- you're a complete idiot! You're a goddamn asshole! [Laughing] Jay: I hate you. Jay, Jay, you don't mean that. No, you can't mean that after all we've been through. Oh, thank god. You got it. Have you got everything? Jay: Die, you son of a bitch, die. Morgan voice-over: With my new hero status, I was able to really crack the whip, and we finally took a family vacation. Dad will always be in outer space, but at least I've got him in an earth orbit, and we're getting to be pals. Mom's a tough one. She's getting a little better with the hugging and kissing. Oh, I did get her to eat a hamburger. That was a real breakthrough. Oh, and Jay took a nice long vacation at a very exclusive resort. He deserved it. Ivan's in the real estate business and he's doing swell. That's his new wife Monica. They're enjoying the American dream in their new home. I got a postcard from Anna. She's happy back in Russia and making new friends. Oh, Emily and I are super tight. I took her to the junior prom. We were the best looking couple there. Like em said, raising parents does take a lot of work, but it can be done. Having a real family is one of the big thrills on this planet. Oh, by the way, dad won the election. Mom got the cover of people, and I got a family.
