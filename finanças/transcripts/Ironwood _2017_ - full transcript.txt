Hey did you hear back from Houghton yet? - Not yet, you? - Huh? - I said, not yet, and you? - I said, did you? - I said I haven't yet, have you? - I said, did you hear back from Houghton? Man, I'm tired of being fucking broke! - What are you doing? - What can I do? - There's a recycling bin across the street. - I'm trying to publish but it's like constant rejection. I've applied to every fucking job in the Non-Contiguous United States, and nothing! Five years man, five fucking years. And 75 fucking thousand dollars worth of student loans. - I know. - No, you don't know, 'cause you haven't even defended yet. And you don't have any debt. - I have debt. - Yeah, peanuts. Whoa! - Oh shit. First aid's in the glove compartment. - Is there any weed? How am I gonna replace my bike? - You know what we need man? - A miracle? - A vacation. - No, no we don't need a vacation, what we need is a job. - What do you want me to do with the bike? All right, I'll pick you up 4:00, 4:15, it depends on what time I get out of the meeting with Williams. - Have fun with the chipmunk. - Shit. - So, I know. - Okay, so, yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yeah. I'm struggling with this. - Well, don't struggle, write. - Right. - I'm not being hard on you Travis. - Devin. - Devin, for my sake. - Oh, I understand. - No, you don't. I mean, you don't understand. Houghton wants to hire you. - What? - What? Yes, Houghton, they want to hire you. - They wanna hire me? - Houghton wants to hire you. - What do you, they haven't contacted me? - They will, probably today. You're their top choice, unless you entirely botch this, the job is yours. - I'm their top choice? - They're considering two other people. One is from Ohio, I think they said. And the other is an ex-student of mine, Caleb Moore. Not really the best student in the world, a bit of a hot head, actually, paranoid, he dropped me as his advisor when I told him that his thesis proposal was only tangentially philosophical. He then went on to accuse me of stealing his ideas. Hasn't really published anything, I'm not really sure why they're considering him at all. You don't know him, do you? - No, yeah, a little. - Anyway, the interview should be fairly soon. It's a bit of a rush job. - Yeah, we have hung out a few times. - All the applicants come to the school for a single, a day of onsite interviews. - Everybody on one day? That's insane. I mean. - What can I say? Academia has become an abattoir. And you my little lamb are the freshest meat. - Okay, so, this, this, and this, and then, this. This is Rawls' Difference Principle. It says that social and economic inequalities are morally acceptable only if they benefit the least advantaged members of society. Thoughts? Yeah. - Is this gonna be on the mid term? - Did the chipmunk say anything else? - No. Look, dude, I don't want this to fuck with our-- - Look, man, we each have a one in three chance of getting this job, right? Right? - Right, yeah. Yes, yes, right. - You and me and this dude from Ohio. He's a he, right? - I don't know, I don't know anything about him or her. - You do the best interview you can do, I'm gonna do the same. This chick, or dude from Ohio's gonna do the same, whoever gets it gets it. So that's that. And we can take old Bertha here. - All right, one condition. - What the fuck are you talking about? - We go camping afterwards. There's this great spot right outside Houghton. - No, I can't. - Why? But I already reserved a spot for us, it's a yurt, it's gonna be awesome. - What the fuck is a yurt? Hey, make a quick stop at-- - We're not stopping for weed. - Come on, man. - I don't want it in the car. - I need it to. - No. - Fuck man, why not? - Because I'm not getting pulled over and ruining my chances at this job. - Our chances. - Same thing. - Look, no one is gonna get pulled over, you're being paranoid. - No, I'm not, I just think about-- - I just said I'd fucking go camping with you, and you're not gonna let me grab a little weed? Clam my nerves, do my best before the interview, not ruin my chance? Come on, man. All right, be right back. - Okay. Hey, just hurry up. Jesus. Hey. - Oh, you made that, nice one. - Hey, out the window. - What? - Come on, man, that's not funny. - Okay, okay, okay, okay, just roll 'em all up, leave mine down. - Why? Are you gonna smoke it out the window? - Yes, I'll smoke out the window. - Fucking better, dude. You know, whenever we finally leave this city in gonna miss it. - Not me, I fucking hate Madison. Think I can drive the next leg? - Hey, did you get the email I sent you the notes on your paper? - Yeah, yeah, thanks. - I didn't. - You didn't? I sent them. - Didn't get 'em. - I definitely sent them. - Definitely didn't get 'em. - Maybe check your spam. - Dude, why would an email that you sent me go? You know what? If you didn't wanna do it just tell me, it's fine. Just let me know. Hey. Look, man, I didn't-- - I don't appreciate being called a liar. - I didn't call you-- - 'Cause I'm not a liar. And I don't back stab, okay? - Okay, all right, I'm sorry, look, I didn't mean anything. - You didn't mean anything? - Okay, I meant something and I shouldn't of. I'm sorry, look, I'm just a little stressed out by all this. - It's okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. Can I drive? What? - All right. - All right. - Just take it easy please. - Yeah, I got it! Oh, we're losing some of your keys. The earth has music for those who listen. Santiana. Santiana motherfucker! Where are you going? - I gotta drain the lizard. Okay, I'll be right back, just stay here. - Okay. Hey. - Hey. - Hey, what's up? Thanks for for doing this. - Yeah, no problem, let's go. - Oh, okay, yeah. - Hey! - Devin, what the fuck? - Who the frick is this? - Nah, it's my friend, he's cool. - No, no, no, I said nothing about a friend. - Caleb, what the fuck are you doing? - Hey friend, come on, get in the car. - No, no, no, no. What? - It's not a big deal. - Who the fuck are you? I'm not getting in your car. - Get the fuck into the car! Oh my God, whoa, hey! Get in. - Are you serious? - Yes, both of you. - Okay, okay. - Caleb, are you crazy? Just do it! - Just get in the passenger seat. You get in the driver's seat, go. - Fuck! What the fuck, man? Just let her call okay, just let her fucking call. Jesus, I told you just fucking. You shoulda just been waiting in the fucking car. - Shh! He's not answering. - Shit. - Shut up. I'm gonna leave a message. Hey Kai, it's your girl Mika, so I got your boy up here, and then all of a sudden this guy Darren-- Devin. - Dar, my name's Darren. - What the fuck are you saying Devin? - Stop giving him a fake name. - You stop! - Wait, shut up both of you! Kai, this guy Devin, or Darren, or whoever the frick he is, he looks like a prick bag. So, if you could give me a call back to know if this kosher, yeah, holler. - Sometimes he responds better if you text him. - I ain't texting him. - Shit. - So, what are we doing? - I got it, drive. - What? - The keys are in the ignition, drive. - No, I'm not driving. - Drive. - Why? - Just fucking do it. - So you guys are down here from Madison for what, a job interview? - Yeah. - What kinda job? - Professor at Houghton. - Oh, so yeah, to the UPA, right? - Yeah, yeah. - So, professor, for what? - Philosophy. - Wait, they have professors for that? - Yeah. - Well, didn't all the philosophers like already die? Drink your coffee. - No, I don't want caffeine before I sleep, and cream upsets my st-- - Drink it. Good. So yeah, UP. Don't they have universities all over the country? - Yes. - Why wouldn't you get a job in like California or something? - Because it's virtually impossible to get a teaching job anywhere. - Maybe you're not any good at it? - I've published, I have excellent teaching evaluations. In another decade I would've had tenure by now but the job market is flooded. Academia is just a finely tuned machine for the destruction of hope. - Shit, I wish I could spend all day reading books and making a living off of talking to students. - Yeah, but, I am broke. I have been for a long time, I'm 70,000 in debt. - For what? - 'Cause, of student loans. - Well why would you go to college if you can't afford it? - Because it's an investment? - In what? - In myself, in doing what I love, in doing philosophy. - Bad investment. That was good. Okay. All right then. So, here is little Miss Molly. You philosophers can go now. - Hey, you know of a good, cheap motel around here? Look, man, I'm sorry, okay? It'll all be fine though, we'll be fine, everything-- - It smells like a goddamn muskrat carcass in here. My stomach's in fucking knots. - Oh, well, hang on, I, no, all I got is this. I was gonna shower, but you can. Hey! What the fuck? - I leave in 10 minutes. - What time is it? - 10 minutes. - Mm-hmm. Fuck, fuck! Yo, where's the weed? You threw it away? Shit man! Shit! Why? Why? Fuck. - Where's the Molly? Where'd you put it? - I got it. - I swear, if I feel. - It's fine man, it's fucking fine, it's fine! Jesus! Fuck!

Hey, Caleb. - Shh! - Hey, Caleb, why do you only wear briefs? - What? - Briefs. I never see you wear boxers or boxer briefs, only briefs. - Why do you care? - I don't know, I just never known a guy to only wear briefs. The boxer brief, infinitely superior to the brief. Have you tried it? - The boxer brief? - Yeah. - Yeah, I tried it. - And? - I eschewed it. - You eschewed it, what are you Lord Byron? - Okay, if you must know I have testicle problems. - What? - Testicle! - What are you talking about? - I don't wanna talk about it. - Like do you wear 'em to sleep or? - I just said, I don't wanna fucking talk about it? - Why not? - 'Cause they're my! 'Cause they're my fucking testicles, man. You wanna tell me about yours? - Yeah, what do you wanna know about 'em? - Bupkis. - What do you do with morning wood? - Fuck man! I said I think we're almost there. Almost. - You guys wanna go in together and get the keys? - You go ahead, Caleb and I will get water. - Yeah. - Unscrew your cap, I'll pump. - Okay, just. - Get it up on there. - Oh, yeah. - So, what do you make of your friend Devin? - He's nice. - Yes, but what is your assessment of him? - I'm not sure. I'm not sure I know what you mean? - As a scholar? - Well, he's all right, but. - Yes? - I don't want to speak poorly of him. - Speak objectively. - Yeah, well I, you know I think his work is mostly just an elaboration of his advisors. - Williams? - Yeah, I know Williams will often help him avoid big mistakes, and got him his one and only publication. Sort of on track with the rest of his life trajectory. - What do you mean? - Well, he's my closest friend, I love him to death, so I feel not right saying this, but, he's basically a child of the privileged class. And since he's black he's been afforded all the advantages that properly belong to blacks at lower income levels, but he's far from the advantaged. I mean, I can assure you, he didn't earn that car. It's a present from daddy. You know, he's basically an Oreo. - A what? - You know, black on the outside, white on the inside. I can carry those, man. - Nope, nope, I got both. Getting two helps with the balance. - Ah. - Okay, so, I guess the trail's that way. - Yeah. - Pick it up! - Ah! Fuck. I think we got a leak here. - Give me the keys, I'll go back into town, get us some bottled waters. - Nonsense! Devin maybe give the leaking one to Caleb, I'll take this one. - No, it's okay, I got it. - No, we got it. - Like your thinking Jane, oh, shit! This one really is leaking. - Yes, it is. There. - Yeah, looks great. - Yeah. - Not too shabby. - Yeah, Devin and I will take this set, I got top! - Actually, I'll take the-- - Actually. - Yes? - Actually, yes, I can take-- - I'll take this top bunk. Of course. - Sure. - And one of you will sleep below me. - You want one of us? - To sleep underneath me. - Are you sure? - I mean, wouldn't you be more comfortable? - Yeah, be more comfortable. Stuff all over, you know? - Yeah, it'd be more. - Comfortable? Yeah. - Yeah. - I need a presence below me to sleep well in the woods. - What about your stuff? - I'll put it up on this top bunk. - Okay. - My stuff should be above someone too. - Where are we? - Who's sleeping? - Below me I would like Devin to sleep, Caleb, you sleep here. Great, unpack, then we'll eat. - Hey. - Yeah, what? - No, fuck. - Yeah, no, no sex. - No hanky. - Of course. We've entered a deep place. - Shit! Was that a bear? - It's was a wolf! - I'm afraid of bears. - Oh. - Fucking early bird. - So, Jane, I know you work on feminist epistemology. - I do. - Yeah! Do you have a follow-up? - Probably should do a follow-up. I mean, I was just gonna ask like you know, just. Hmm, the. - Go ahead, Devin. Yes, please. - I mean. - Go on, just say it, man. No need to be nervous, just ask. - Ask! - What do you make of the critiques on the entire notion of feminist epistemology as opposed to just straight epistemology? I mean, I don't mean to denigrate your work at all. It's just, I'm asking purely-- - It's a good question. It is? - A good, and brave question. Is it? - It takes guts to ask. It does. - It does? - As you might guess, I'm unsympathetic to those critiques. - Of course. - I'm actually at work on a paper that addresses some recent criticisms from a series of authors that most forcefully present your question. So, basically I start with the question of how to evaluate. - You are so fucking lucky! - Luck's got nothing to do with it, baby. - Okay. Ready? Make sure you get in buddy. Yeah, yeah. - Ready? Let's push. Okay, ready? - Yeah. - We got it Jane, one second. There we go, so fishing life, this is, oh, okay. What was it like? - It? - The interview process. Oh. - Oh, great. - It was great. - It was fine. - Can you be just a little bit more specific? - Is there something specific you want us to discuss? - It's a new system we're trying, bringing in more than one candidate at the same time, like certain British universities. I imagine it was a bit stressful. - Not really. - It was. A little. I mean, I could've performed better. - Yeah, could've as well. - At least no one asked you to interview on a bed. - What do you mean? - You two just don't realize how privileged, nevermind. - No, Jane, please, share. - You don't have to tell us anything, Jane. - It's not just one thing. - Can you be more specific? - Let's see, more specific. How 'bout when during grad school your professors and colleagues dismiss your claims as stupid, trivial, and unimportant. Or when you get a little bit of success be it in teaching, or publishing, it's attributed to the fact that you likely are fucking someone. Or when during your job search multiple hiring committee members hit on you and pass it off to the guys of a joke. Or when you finally do get the job you are expected to be grateful that you even have an office. So, you shouldn't complain about the fact that it's filthy or in another building. Or when at said institution you receive high teaching evaluations, but the chair of the department attributes it to your good looks. When every single interaction with a male in your discipline is shrouded under the cloud of, is this person sexually attracted to me? Or will I realize that they're attracted to me, or will he think that I'm attracted to him? And then you start to question your own self and ask, am I being too sexual? Or maybe I'm just overreacting, or maybe I'm not even a good philosopher, and maybe I should just quit. - So Jane, how do you know this area so well? - A friend of mine lives close by. We camp here together sometimes. - Nice. Yeah, I was wondering. Yes? - It's nothing. - You sure? - Woo, yeah, I'm fine, it'll pass. - Okay. - Yeah. - What's the matter with you? - It's the testicle problem. - Shut the fuck up. - You're playing. - What's happened? - It's nothing. - Did you sprain something? - No, I'm fine, fine, I'll be fine. - We can rest for a moment. Woo, walking helps. - What's happened? - Testicle problems. Is there a hospital nearby? - I don't need to go to the fucking hospital, okay? I've been through this, it'll pass, I just need to lay here for a bit. - Were you wearing briefs? - Let's stop at Union Bay. Oh easy on the turn, easy on the turn. - Caleb, I think you should stay here. - No, I'm fine, I'm all right. - I want you to stay here, recuperate, Devin and I won't be long. - Devin, quick word. - Yeah. Hey man, are your balls okay? - What the fuck are you trying to do? - What are you talking about? - Making me look bad in front of McGinnis. - What? - For every man there's a bait he can't resist swallowing. Fuck, quoting Nietzsche and shit, what the fuck is that? - She's weird. Look, you were the one who said hey-- - Just don't sabotage, okay? - I'm not. - Just don't, okay, just promise you won't. - Fine, I promise, you happy? - You like Caleb, do you? - Yeah. - You think he's a good philosopher? - A good philosopher? Mm-hmm. - I don't know if I should comment. - Why not? He did. - He did? Yes. - What'd he say? - I won't say. - But you want me to share my thoughts on him? - I do, it's only fair, I won't tell him, of course. - Why do you want this? Hmm? - This job, why do you want this job? - To show people. - Show who? - Colleagues, friends. Doubters. Anyone who looks me and thinks oh, there's a black guy in a white profession, of course he's gonna do well, it's easy for him. But then they wanna hang out with me because it's cool, or progressive, or something like that. Like, hey look at me, I got a black friend. You know they'll invite me to drink, or to play basketball, but, they never invite me to their study sessions. Or take my questions seriously. - Listen, I wanna tell you. - Caleb's a mediocre philosopher. He's not very original and yet he's always critiquing things on being unoriginal. As you can tell, he's got a temper. I mean, he's like a time bomb. One moment from now he's gonna be like, oh, that's so unjust. Or, fuck those rich conservatives, when really he, he treats people like shit. - Why are you? - I'm his friend because I looked up to him as an incoming grad student, because he seemed to know what he was talking about when he doesn't. And he does drugs. - Let's go back. - Yeah. Fuck. - Hey. Have any ibuprofen? - Oh, I'm feeling better now. It's for me. - Oh, yeah. It's in the trunk, it's in my backpack, I'll get it. Oh, I got it. - You all right man? - Where exactly? Yeah. - It's in the right side pouch. You look upset. Oh Jane, it's in the left, it's in the left side pouch, left not the right. - That's where I looked in the first place, got it. Okay, let's go. - Trout time. - I wanna do something with you two. No, sit. Put out your hands. Now close your eyes. Now open them. - Oh shit. - What is it? - This is ecstasy, right? - These aren't. - It's Caleb's Molly. - Fuck you, man. Jane these aren't mine, and they're vitamins. - Oh, are they now? - Yes. - Well, I want you boys to take your vitamins. - Okay, this is freaking me out. - Sit. I'll do it with you. You will? - You will? - Yes. - Holy shit. - Your turn. - Oh, mama, Devin, I. - Fuck it. - That's a good boy. - Double fuck it. - Good boy. - Wow, I think I feel it. - You can't yet, man. - Why? - 'Cause it takes like up to an hour. - Oh. - Sit down. Now, I'm going to go to the outhouse and when I come back we will feel good together. 'Kay. - 'Kay. - You feel anything yet? - No. - Me neither. God, I hope this isn't laced with anything. - Knowing Kai, it's not. - I hope it isn't. - It isn't. - I hope not. - It ain't. - God, I hope not. - Fuck, man. - What? - Shit. Look, I'm gonna, I wanna say something. - Okay. - It's not good. - All right, say it bro. - I feel terrible. - It's okay, I'm here for ya buddy. - I just. - What bro? - I'm a terrible friend. - What? Come on dog, no, you're not. You're an awesome friend. Amazing! Fucking incredible. - I'm not. - You are! - I called you an Oreo to McGinnis. - A what? - Black on the outside, white on the inside. - Fuck outta here, you did. - I did, man, I did. I'm a rotten piece of shit, I'm a miserable shit. I'm a piece of shit! And you mean so much to me, man, I just, I got caught up in the whole thing, and I said. - What? You did? - Yeah. - Why? - Just please forgive me. - I don't understand why you would say that to her? - Please, please forgive me. I'm shit, and you're amazing. - It's okay. It's okay, man, I forgive you. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Thank you, God. - Yeah, dude. You are the best friend, you are the best friend. - Oh. - I think it's working. - Yeah! Oh man, Caleb. - Yeah? - You know what? - What? - Before we left on this trip. - Yeah? - Williams told me that he heard from Houghton that I was gonna get the job. Innit that crazy? - Ow. Oh my God. - Ow, motherfuck. Oh, my God, mother of shit. - Goddammit motherfucker. - What the fuck is wrong with you? - I fucking hate you, motherfuck! - Me? - Yeah. - Me? - Yeah, you, you backstabbing, cocksucker. - Oh, I don't believe, you know what, fuck this man. You want a piece of me, you piece of turkey. - Oh yeah, oh yeah, fuck, ow, ow, ow. - Yeah, fuck you. Ow, fuck. - Come on, come on! - Wait, boys, what the fuck is wrong with you two? - He started it! - Like hell I did. - Shut the fuck up. - No, I won't. - Shut the fuck up. - That's right, you tell him, Jane. - You too. Drop the weapons! This is supposed to be Molly, why are you two behaving like this? - Oh my God you're right oh it must be laced with something. It's not laced - Like angel dust or something. - Motherfucker. - That's why there was an angel on the tablet. - No, no, the angel is a symbol of transcendent annihilation. - Listen to me, neither of you has the job. - What? - What, how come? - The internal candidate has it. - Internal candidate. - No, what about? - What about the Ohio guy? - He's a girl! He's a she? - She's a she, and she is an internal candidate. - I. - Why Jane? - I. Why. - I. Why what? - Why did the department bring us here? Why did you invite yourself on our camping trip? Why, motherfucking, why? - I'm sleeping in the car tonight, I'll get these back to you in the morning. - What? Where the fuck are you going, Jane? - Just give it up, man. - No, Jane, wait. Just, ah, oh, my, oh. - You know I didn't want a three-way anyway, Jane! Oh my God. - Fuck! Dear Caleb and Devin, my friend picked me up. I'm sorry things turned out the way they did. And I hope you two can either reconcile your differences or, fuck you, Jane. - I wanted to let you know that I'm the internal candidate. - She's the, she's the! - I knew it. I knew it.
