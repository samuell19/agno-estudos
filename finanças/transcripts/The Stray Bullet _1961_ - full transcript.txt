Let's go! Mansu, let's hurry up and go! What is wrong with you all? You didn't pay for all the drinks. Why did you break the glass door? I told you we'll pay the rest tomorrow. Didn't we say we ran out of money and ask you to cut us some slack? That's your problem! And why did you break the glass door? Are you going to mistreat us like this? We are what's left of the dead, so we got drunk a little and broke the door. Does he look all right to you? I don't know. Go and talk to the owner. We might not be able to pay him back, but tell the owner not because we don't want to pay him back. Commander, we should go. I told you not to address me that. Just be a pal, and call me Gyeongsik. Cut it out! What's the point of calling him Commander when we are all good-for-nothings here? But, Sergeant... I miss the time when I called him Commander. Me, too. Fellow soldiers, we saved our country when it was dying. We march over the dead bodies of our fellow soldiers... Commander! We should scream and yell so that everyone can hear us. Good idea! If that'd make us feel better. Gyeongsik! Let's be safe! Safe, I said. Yes, we should all be safe. But it's all a lost cause now. You're talking nonsense. Fellow soldiers died like falling flowers. Rest in peace. We march over the dead bodies of fallen soldiers. Defeat the enemy with vengeance in our blood. Fellow soldiers died like falling flowers. Rest in peace. Hold your heads up high! - And run! - Run! Salute the commander! Sergeant Park! - Your medal is not straight! - I apologize, sir! See you later! Didn't we say we wouldn't torment each other about it? But you haven't said anything yet. I'm so frustrated that it's driving me crazy. I couldn't stand it when you were with me. - Just go back. - I know. I couldn't stand being alone and lonely. For a while, I wished one of us would die and just disappear. Then, we'd at least have memories that we could cherish. But now I have this scary desire to live. All I want is for us to be together. We can say our marriage vows tonight with just a bowl of water. Myeongsuk, please wait for me a little longer. Just kill me then. I waited for you to finish your army service. And I waited two more years. I stayed cooped up at home, afraid that I'd go insane. Stop! Please stop... I'm not wishing for something grandiose. But I don't want to succumb to this reality where I can't even fulfill one hundredth of the desire that a human being can have. I am...I am a cripple, a has-been, a broken bowl used and then thrown away after the war. Cheolho! Let's go! Let's go! Kim Seongguk's Accounting Office Mr. Song, you're the first one in the office as usual. Is it okay if I clean the place? How about staying at the coffee shop on the first floor? Is it your tooth again? You should go see a dentist when you get paid today. You have a terrible toothache all the time. I don't know how you can stand it without going to a dentist. Let's go! Kids, let's go! Let's go! Little Uncle, did you sell many newspapers? Here, have some. Give me something to eat! I'm hungry! Who told you to go around selling newspapers? You should go to school. You're always nagging me. Go and quit the stuff tomorrow! Let's go! - Uncle, are you going downtown today? - I am. - Will you make lots of money then? - Of course! - Then can you buy me some pretty shoes? - Sure! - Really? - I'll buy them for you tomorrow for sure! You're lying. Let's go! Even someone like you, Commander, couldn't find a job. I regret leaving the army. If you think things will be like the army life, you're in for trouble. All the big talk and dreams are gone, and I feel scared about the whole thing. Miri! - It's been a while. - Look who's here! Glad I could see you here. What brings you here to the coffee shop? - Have a seat! - Thanks. So good to see you. Why didn't you ever come out and pay us a visit? - Are you hungry? - No, I'm fine. We're fixing the place, so we can't really offer you anything. If you have any apples left, give me some! Sure! Why didn't you get married? You look terrible. Have you been sick? No. Anyway, how's your new job at the film company? Oh, that... How should I say it... It's like living the high life. Oh, no... We just met, but I'm scheduled for a shoot. It's okay. You should go. I'm so sorry. They said they'd send a car to pick me up, but it's late. Idiots! The thing is, I came here to ask you for a favor. Really? For what? Can you get me a job at your film company? Seriously? Do you think it'll be that easy to become an actress? Let me tell you what it takes to become one... Not to become an actress. Any work is fine with me. Oh, the car is here. I'm sorry, but I'll ask around. See you later. - Ms. Goh! - You surprised me. - It's been a while. - I didn't recognize you. It's me, Song Yeongho who is looking for work. You know the saying, clothes make the man. Do I look good enough to land myself a job? - I don't know. - What's wrong? Have you forgotten? That we won't see each other until you find a job. You should keep your word. And see who can't wait until then. To be looking for a job because of love... Was I someone who didn't mean anything to you? No, that's not it. How about we have a drink? I'm on my way to a shoot. What is it like to be an actress? Why don't you go in? Your sister is in there, crying. A person has to live within his means; otherwise... That's right... Myeongsuk! - Sergeant! - Look who's here! Sergeant Park! When were you discharged? You are the one I look up to in or out of the army. Let me treat you to dinner tonight. What do you mean? We should take you out to dinner. What brings you here? I know you feel frustrated at home, but you spend too much time out these days. And being out doesn't really get you anywhere. It's the same thing, being out or being at home. Is that all you can say? How often do you see Gyeongsik? I'm tired of dating now. I'm sorry about not making things any better. - From now on, I will... - What should I do to go insane? The damn clock won't go any faster. Mr. Song, how about we take a break? I don't want to be the only one slacking off. Yes, thank you. People like us who go from one paycheck to the next can only take a break when the boss is away. - Mr. Song? - Yes? Let's go and have lunch. It's on me. Thank you, but I have a toothache... You always say no. That toothache of yours must be terrible. Why don't you have it pulled out? I'm off to lunch. Ms. Choi, would you like to join me? Oh, thank you! Can you please get me a cup of barley tea? Yes, sir. Since you got paid today, you should go see a dentist. Commercial Bank of Korea Namdaemun Branch Are you just going to head home with your pay envelop? Seeing the happy face of my wife is a pleasure that I enjoy. You're such a bore. Yu Dental Clinic Hello. - How much are these? - Those? 300 hwan. It is a good deal! My hometown is a mountain village where flowers bloom. Peach blossoms, apricot blossoms, and baby azaleas. A village decked out with flowers like a palace. Oh, how I miss the time when I was playing in the midst of... Mom! Dad's home! Let's go! Dad! Big Uncle said he'll buy me a new skirt. I see. And shoes, too. And I'm going to visit the Hwashin department store with Mom and Little Uncle. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! It's hot! Seeing how someone like you, Commander, was not able to settle down, I really regret leaving the army. If you think things will be like the army life, you're in for trouble. I've been everywhere like a dog looking for work for the past two years since finishing the army. With the spirit and courage I learned in the military, I was undaunted and ready to hunt for a bear. That was how I put my foot back in society. But I felt sorry for myself at the prospect of fighting with such a strong bear. So I gave that up. And? Then, I went for a boar that was not as strong as a bear. Still, I wasn't strong enough. A deer was too fast. If I could fly, maybe I could've caught a pheasant at least. So I came up with the best idea ever! A rabbit! They are common enough. So I went to get myself a rabbit, but there were more hunters than rabbits out there. You tell it like A Thousand and One Nights. Those small rabbits are the twentieth-century's mammoths. So what we need is an ounce of the courage of a crow that is not scared of a scarecrow. Wait... What is that ounce of courage of a crow you keep talking about? Let me tell you. Sparrows are afraid of a scarecrow, but birds like crows are not afraid of it. Not at all. They'll sit on top of it and shove dirt into it, or pick at it with their filthy beaks. I'm going to take this shortcut. - That's too dangerous. - I'm fine. See you later. Be careful! This is why you need Myeongsuk next to you. I'm going to go down with one step, so you watch! Why do you always change the topic when I mention her name? What's going on between you two? - Let's not talk about it. - I know it's hard on you. But don't leave her. She's a poor girl. Nothing happened between us, so it's not like I'm leaving her. I wish she would leave me. Why are you saying that? She said she loves you more because you've been injured. Without her, I wouldn't have had the hope to go on living. Then why are you dragging this on? Yeongho. I'm not hoping for something big. I wanted to have at least the smallest dream, or the tiniest hope for me and her. But I can't even do a thing to make that come true. I'm but half a man. And imagine we had a child. That'd only bind us together and make us resent each other. Haven't you seen your brother's shoulders? How they are drooping? You, his wife, and his mother are like burdens on him, burdens that weigh tons. People have become nothing but burdens to each other these days, and I'd rather die than be a burden on someone. Why are you waiting outside? Uncle! Your sister hasn't come home yet. Myeongsuk is not home yet? She has never been this late before. Maybe she's not going to come home today. We should go in. She hasn't slept well for the past several days. Do you know why? What is it that you are searching for? My life has taken me to the vast wilderness. I don't care for money, fame, or love. I didn't think we'd meet again like this. People'd misunderstand us if they heard that. That panting sound is what you hear when people finally meet after missing each other. - You survived. - I did my best to survive. - How did you know it was me? - I recognized you when you smiled. Really? Maybe I shouldn't have smiled then. But why? Because you only recognized me when I smiled. How about we go and talk over a drink? Looking like this? I'm just coming back from the bathhouse. Let's walk, and we can talk. When I first saw you, I wasn't sure. So I took a quick walk down memory lane, and there I found a piece of the old past like a figment of my imagination. Looking like what? Like an officer, saying "Hello, Mona Lisa." - Did I really say that? - You did. My room is on the rooftop. You live at a high place. And there is a good reason for it. What? How about we race to the top? - You're so childish. - It'll be fun. Okay, I'll race you. On one condition. What? You should start from the second floor to be fair. I knew you'd say something like that. I have a better idea. What? Carry this with you, and you can be the man. I guess being a man means nothing much now. Go! - We're almost there. - I'm out of breath. I ran up because I get so annoyed walking up and down these stairs with 44 steps. Then why do you live here? Because I wanted to try looking down on things. We're here. Quiet! Who is he? - The gatekeeper to heaven. - He's sure old enough to be one. This is the sorry state of my life. What? It's like a palace. This used to be my mom's storage place. Please... What are you staring at? Your picture. Memories are strange... I remembered you after having seen you only for a couple of seconds. Did I stay two days at the hospital where you were working, Lieutenant Oh? How did you know my last name is Oh? I found out after I was transferred to a hospital away from the front. Why did you want to know? Because I missed the faint smile on your face. Was that why you said, "Hello, Mona Lisa?" Now I remember your first name...Seolhui. Don't you go around using someone's name without permission. The patients had a lot to say about the little glimpse we'd had of you. That your smile was like our immortal dream. - Would you like some coffee? - A cup, thank you. So how has life been treating you? It's been like living a secret that I didn't even know about. That sounds like a strange secret. It's like life and how we can never know about it. - What about your family? - There is no one now. Do you still go to school? Please call me by my name, too. It's Yeongho. - I dropped out. How about you? - In my third year now. I envy you. - With no family, how about your tuition? - I work part time. I work in the basement for four hours every day. In a smoke-filled room. The basement and the rooftop. It must be tough. No, I enjoy it. Yes, this is Song Cheolho speaking. Who? Myeongsuk? She is my sister. Yes, I'll be there right away. What happened? Was your sister in a car accident? No... I have to go and see. Given your work and integrity, we trust you, and we'll let her go this time, but you have to watch out for her and make sure that she does not go out at night and do things like that again. I will. - Then sign here please. - Yes. You can take her home now. What is your address? Seoul, Jung-go, Chungmu-ro 4th street... - And your name? - Kim Chunja. - Kim Chunja? - Yes, Kim Chunja. - And how old are you? -19. Thank you. No problem. And who was that with you? - Hey! - Nice to see you. Mr. Song! A love letter for you. Are you going to tease me like that? - Sir? - Hi! I met the woman that I've been dreaming of for so long. Yeah? I'm going to tell Miri on you. It must be something really interesting. It says there is a job for me. I wonder what kind of job it is. Since you're so handsome, maybe they want you as an actor. Are you teasing me as well? By the way, what time is it? Ten to three. I'll see about this. It's right there, and below that, too. Where is he? He should be here by now. - You should emphasize this more. - I don't know... Yes, that'll be better. Assistant Director, I'm so sorry you have to wait for him. No, it's fine with me, but maybe it'll mess up your schedule. Miri! Why are you so late? We've been waiting for you! - Have a seat first. - Okay. Director, he is the one I've been telling you about. Why don't you introduce yourself? Hello, I'm Song Yeongho. Hello. I'm the assistant director. I've heard so much about you from Miri. - Have a seat. - Thank you. So would you like to star in our movie? - Star in a movie? - Yes. The thing is, our film company is making this movie. Here. Why don't you take a look? We've been looking for an actor for the leading role. Because Miri recommended you, the director has also half consented to it. The main role is a disabled veteran. He is like you, Mr. Song, in terms of looks and personality. And we can really use your wound. So we are really happy to have met someone who is just like the character. I guess we are both lucky. So a bullet went through your side, is that right? - Yes, I have two scars. - That's what we need. In our movie, the main character suffers from a bullet wound on his side, and the army doctor gives up on him, but a nurse officer saves him, and with his mental strength... You mean that is in this script? Yes! I'm sorry, but can you take your shirt off so we can take a look at your scars? You can come this way. Change the story! Change it so that he has no eyes, no nose, and no legs. That way it will sell more. So what you need is not me, but my rotten scars. And you want me to sell them? I didn't get shot at for fun! What happened to your hand? What's wrong with your hand? A fortune came rolling my way, and I shattered it to pieces. I should go and crush all the shitheads! So many things are messed up in the world, and it's driving me mad! Hey! You said you'll do anything I say, didn't you? Yes, sir! And you are good at driving? I can drive fifty miles with my eyes closed. I can have you rolling in dough soon. Did you get a job? Almost. The thing is...what I really want to do is to act, not drive. Are you good at acting? Yes, I'm pretty talented at it. I was the drama club president in middle and high school. All right, then. Just be my driver for one day, which will be tomorrow or the day after. All right. I'm going to be out, but bring everyone to the bar. Bring the lame ones and the crippled ones. The good-for-nothing ones who are kind and good. If it weren't for you, I'd have been so lonely. That is a good business with no money to start it. And they'd probably get married later, pretending to be a college student or a working girl. I'm sure they'd act like they don't know a thing. Commercial Bank of Korea Namdaemun Branch I see. I see. You're late. What's up? I need to talk to you. Two glasses. - What's wrong? - Come and sit here. Did I do something wrong? Have your drink first. No, tell me first. If not, I won't touch the drink. I will tell you then. Do you know that I almost worshipped you? Everything you said the last time was right. Every word of it. But it's all wrong. It was all about being self-interested. It was just your self-defense talking. Self-defense? The words of a helpless coward. And do you know who was sacrificed by that? Myeongsuk! - What? - Listen to me. The first person who was sacrificed was Myeongsuk! Suk! Seolhui! Go home! Why do you come and bother me every night? Just go home, will you? If you don't, I'm really going to... It's not an empty threat. I'm really going to shoot. I'll send you to hell before you finish writing ten poems. I'm sorry! Come in! I didn't expect you this late at night. My next door neighbor is a young man who drinks every night. He just barges in here and blabbers on and on about poems and life. So I was going to scare him a bit. I see. It's not a toy. Pull the trigger, and it will shoot. - Yeongho? - Yes? On the battlefield, we destroyed every obstacle that our enemy put in front of us with these guns. We killed our enemies who were after our lives, and then we marched on. We did. But we couldn't bring down the wall of fate that divided us, not with the gun. What do you mean, Seolhui? I'm sorry. What am I talking about... Seolhui... Where did you get this gun, and why? It's not what you think. Even if you were suicidal, you wouldn't need a gun. Then why do you have it? It belongs to Captain Kim in the platoon. When he gets drunk, he likes to act all macho. He acted like a cowboy with his gun, so I hid it from him. I should return it to him but haven't seen him for a while. Sit down. No, thank you. I just wanted to see you before I go home tonight. - Goodbye. - But you just came. My mission is done here. What do you mean? You still act like you are in the army. I mean the mission to see you. Good bye. Good bye. Can you please stay a little longer? Come this way. You can see the moonlight. That must be the young man who is in love with you. He makes this huge fuss about writing poems. He said he'll write exactly ten poems. But he said there is not enough stuff in this world for him to put in ten poems. But when he is done with his tenth poem, he said he'll use a grenade and blow his body up into smithereens. He's an odd one. With a grenade? He doesn't want to leave behind any trace of him in this shitty world. A young man who's seen more blood in life than an old soldier. Maybe what torments him more is not that, but loneliness. They say he used to be such a happy young man who didn't have a moment to feel lonely. Before I met him. Please, don't go. I feel as if I am the only one standing in this vast place, and the feeling gets worse at night. - Yeongho... - Yes... - I have something to give you. - What is it? I was going to give it to you today, but I'll do it tomorrow. I don't want anything but your heart. That is... That is... Maybe we can change our fate. When you come by tomorrow, open that drawer. Uncle! Your friend is coming. The Hook-hand. Don't you call him the Hook-hand. Can you give me one coin? Next time I'll make lots of money and buy you a new skirt. That's a lie. You said that last time, too. I mean it this time. And I'll also buy you pretty shoes, too. - Really? - Really. You're lying. And I'm going to take you to the Hwashin department store. You're lying. - Will we take Little Uncle, too? - Of course. You're lying. - Yeonghog - What's up? - Something terrible has happened. - What? - The commander is... - What about Gyeongsik? What happened to him? When I dropped by his place, he wasn't there. You mean he killed himself? If he had, that'd be the end. No, he's disappeared. - When? - He took the morning train. Without a word? When his landlady asked him where he was going, he just sighed and after laughing, he said when you ask a dying person where he's going, he'll say he doesn't know. Let's go... That bastard... Why did he take it so hard... Did something happen between you two? Let's go... I'm just waiting for someone. You shouldn't be here. This is not a place that anyone can come into. These birds don't like people, you see. They must be hungry. I'm late feeding them because I had to attend a funeral. What? You're still here? Sir... Are you a reporter? No, I'm waiting for the young lady who lives here. Who are you waiting for? The young lady called Seolhui who lives here. - She's gone. It happened last night. - What do... Where did she go? I had to bury her this morning. What do you mean? The whole thing must be a dream... How could she fall from hereto there... You mean she jumped to her death? No, she didn't kill herself. That young man who wrote poems... He pushed her off from here. And he jumped to his death with her. Seolhui! Seolhui! You're going to break the door. What's the point of going in there? I can't believe you. Wait! When did it happen? Around 3 in the morning. Did you say the young man who wrote poems did that to her? He must have fancied her very much. But she wouldn't give him the time of day. He dragged her out and jumped off holding her. I was so happy that we met. Now I think I can understand about life. What I wanted to tell you were these words: I love you. The wall of fate divides us, and we cannot bring it down with a gun. Why not! Why not! You mean Sergeant Gwak? It's for you. Yes? Yes... To the bar where we owe money? I see. Bring everyone to the place. We'll drink all night to celebrate tomorrow because tomorrow will be the best day of our life. And have you heard anything about Gyeongsik, the good-for-nothing commander? You have to get a jeep for tomorrow, got it? Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Kids... We have to pack our bags and leave now. We have to follow those sheep. Everyone is headed to the green pasture. Are you up? Hyeok? She's asleep. - Did you just come? - Yes. Give her these when she wakes up. You shouldn't have. They are expensive... I'm too ashamed to say anything to you. I've never been a good brother... You shouldn't say things like that. She's going to be so happy when she sees them. She's been asking for new shoes day and night. - How about dinner? - I ate. When did you get home? Just now. He bought her these shoes. Cheolho... We should live the good life now. Buy a nice, big house with a name plate with your name on it written so big that even a blind man can see. Are you drunk again? Yes, but just a little. Stop drinking, will you? When I am with my friends, we end up drinking together. What do you think drinking will get you in the end? Nothing, but I just feel so frustrated. Let's go! I'm lucky, though, to have them as my friends, those good-for-nothing friends. Without them, I wonder how I'd have survived. Let's go! Try these cigarettes. I'm hungry. You should get your life together now. It's been two years since you left the army. I know I should. Things will be decided tomorrow. Did you get a job? A job? You want me to do the counting for someone else and get paid not enough to pay for the bus fare like you? Do you have any better idea then? I do. All I need is to be daring like others. - Be daring? - Yes, be daring. You are not planning to do something illicit, are you? What do you mean illicit? Let's go...let's go... Yeongho, I could've lived a rich man if I'd had no qualms about doing things like that. It's not that I don't respect you for it. You want to live an honest life even if you stay poor. But if you were to think that life is nothing better than ten hwan in the dirty hand of a little child, then how much you have will determine how much of life you get to see. The problem is that you can't quit your life after seeing it depending on the money you have in your pocket. You've lived with your toothache for days, but were you able to save money because of it? That's where the tragedy lies. That we have to keep on living this life. Is there a law that says we shouldn't leave here and live inside a bigger fence? What you're saying makes no sense. Makes no sense, did you say? To be rich, you mean we have to forget about our conscience or morality? No, not at all. That's what I mean by you make no sense. Your idea is coming from some twisted place in your heart. - Yes, it's twisted. - Let's go! - It's twisted for sure. - Let's go! But it became twisted too late. It should've become twisted before our mom lost her mind. Before Myeongsik became a prostitute. It should've become twisted when there was one empty place in the Dongdaemun market for us to make money. Before shrapnel got stuck in my belly. No, it'd have been better if I had been born with a twisted heart. Let's go! Let's go... Don't be scared. Let's go! Mom... Let's go... Let's go... Can you stay home today? - It hurts... - Can you? My belly... I have this feeling that everything will go well if you stay home today. How is it that things will go well with you if I stay home? I'm asking you to do something for the first time. What are you going to do today that you're acting so strange? What do you mean I'm acting strange? Like I told you, please stay home today. Let's go! Minho! Minho! Minho! Go home and get your breakfast. I made you hate me, didn't I? I never said that. Because I've been good-for-nothing, you had to... Stop selling newspapers tomorrow. You go to school. Your hands get frozen in winter because of these. Why did you do that? Don't cry. I'll make money, not you. Here. Take this. I didn't ask you for money! Did you wait long? Did you bring a jeep? Good! Drive it here. Me? I'll be in the Chinese restaurant below Danseongsa Theater. Get there fast. Let's go! Where to? - To the film company first. - Yes, sir! Turn the car around and wait for me. So the schedule has been changed? Yes, this one here. Miri! I have a favor to ask you. It's too late. They decided on someone else. That's not it... You look liked a drug addict asking for money. The thing is... I'm going to come into lots of money soon. - What? - It's true. I want you to stay with me tonight. - Why? - Don't ask me why, though. - I have a shoot tonight. - Just skip it. I'm asking you for my life. Promise me. You promised. I have to get going. I'll drop by your place tonight. - Where to now? - What time is it? Why do they pay us with checks? Four minutes to four. To Namdaemun Bank. Hurry! We don't have time. Yes, sir. - Wait over there. - Yes, sir. Keep the car running. I'll be out soon. Even though it be a cross that raiseth me Still all my song shall be Nearer, my God, to thee. The robber is my fiance. - Get in then. - Thank you. 251! 251! 30, stand by. Roger that.
