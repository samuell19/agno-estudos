A girl came out of the juvenile facility and discovered that her beloved had left her she asked why he went his way he answered her these words you could have been my wife if only you lived a decent life but you chose a life of crime so now go in and take your punishment then you wish for a better life go without crime so never choose that path which leads to the gate of the youth institution - Speed ​​up. - Shut up! - Annetta and Carol are not here. - Oh my God! Stay here and keep an eye on the herd. What about the apartment? There isn't a landlord nearby, is there? No annoying landlord who keeps coming running. My husband was also a truck driver. - Oh really. - I'm crazy about trucks. I loved the long rides. In fact, that's why I married him. He got sick and lost all his hair. He was always with the 1 Yamouth race. - Is he Irish? - Yes. Do you know Frank Brady? He smeared Guinness on his head to get his hair back. Can you drive me to Highfield tomorrow? I haven't seen my daughter in weeks. Certainly. Is that your old roommate, Carol? Doreen? Imagine having such an image of yourself. She seems to like herself. Would you like her in the car? The only problem is finding her. - Stop it! - What's with you? I don't know what's wrong with her. She is so easygoing. She's just a little weird sometimes. Would you like to be the father of my bosom? Alice is a lovely kid. I miss her. Do you know where her father is? Frank Brady. Yes, that's a brilliant idea. Let's find the father. Where could he now be. - Damn Frank Brady. -Where? His drinking buddy might know. Ted Grainger on Angel Street. Call the number information. I'm going to have a little chat with this one. No one has to ask you to keep quiet. - What are you looking for? - Nothing. Why are you sitting there on your high horses? Come down. Do not touch me! Ted Grainger on Angel Street, please. - Come down now, don't sit there in the corner. - Let me go! Shut up! I can't hear anything. - Are you a lesbian, right? -No! Why are you sitting here then? Don't write on my photo! Write on the wall then. One moment.. two-three-five... ...Six-Seven. - Now I have you, Brady. - What types are you? - Runaways from the youth institution. - Shut up, you stupid bitch. You fucking whore! What are you doing, you idiot? Can you confirm that? I need to know by Tuesday. Howden, Miss Holly. Will you come back then? Thanks. Howden. It says that when you are arrested- - Did you say you had friends here that you wanted to join. If you intended your escape attempt- - to come to our closed institution, you might regret it. Mrs. Budd, will you follow Carol to her cell? - Where do you live, Carol? - I am one of the lost. Do not worry. I'm used. No fixed address. Yes you, here you are stuck for a while, although it depends on yourself. Now you are a so-called apprentice. Come on. Tea is served at five o'clock, and then it's the changing of the guard. After that you can watch TV, or participate in Dr. Sile's therapy. - At eight o'clock it's lock-in. - That sounds interesting, miss. You will live with Kathleen. She wants out as soon as possible, so she behaves. - Do you have any questions? - Yes. Does Doreen Withers live in this block of flats? Yes she does. You seem to be in luck. I'll let you make yourself at home. Tea at five, don't forget that. I made it, Doreen. I did it. My name is Annetta Brady. I'm going to visit my daughter, Alice. Sign here. I haven't heard from her in six weeks. I'm coming out soon, so I want to arrange to get her home. You go crazy when you don't hear anything about them for so long. - I cried the whole time. - Please sit down. Annetta Brady is here to meet her baby. I have waited so long. What happens? They are just dressing her. - Where is the restroom? - First door on the left. Alice. Do you want to come play with me? can i be your friend No, please, not here in front of my child. You should be ashamed. It went so well for her. Now it will take time to get her back in shape. - Calm down now, my child. - Calm me down? Alice, do you know that I am your mother? Take out the other children. I'm your mother, Alice! My God, she has forgotten me! Alice! Alice! Alice! It was a young lady from Smutsigbyn who was much cuter than her sister system giggled and squirmed chastely but the other, she came when she was kissed - Don't you hear I'm busy! - I'm not one of the prison guards. - Where are all the others? - They wear well at the factory. - What are you sitting here for? - My filthy language. I'm actually rotting away. - Do you want a cigarette? - If I want to! I put it under the door. See you. Thanks. - Do you want to hear one more joke? - Sure. - I like the melody. - All songs have the same melody. It was a young man from Rangoon which lacked all rhythm and tone if it said on a note "don't shit on our stairs" then he ran and slipped under the bridge - Did you like it? - Yes, then. - Hello. - Hello. You must be Carol. - Are you coming from the factory? - No, from the kitchen. I see you have introduced yourself to my child. This is my husband, our cats. This is the living room. I am the one who has acquired almost all the things. When Terry was fired at 21- - I decided that we would manage. Do you have a fire? He had been working there since he left school. I was a pro. Not like the other amateurs here. I'm taking my seven months, because I have something to come back to. Is it a joke? Potatoes and dead children again! It's apricots and little pill pods. The whole ration in one cup? I'd rather have a whole cup, than small sips like you. That's why you want to exchange a sugar ration for a cigarette? Two sugar rations for one cigarette. One and a half rations of sugar. Mac! Let your tongue rest! I have verbal diarrhea. The doctor says I have to talk. Keep your damn jam, damned scarecrow. And you seem dressed for a cocktail party. With entertainment like that, it's really festive here. Can't you do better than that, Mac? One more, don't be stingy. You can have my sugar. Here comes Mrs. Skit with her entourage. A new, nasty guest. Hope she remembered to buy duty free. Carry on with your tea, girls. Your shit! I only got two minutes with my daughter. Now I'm stuck here. Was it you who yelled? You who came here voluntarily- - to be with your fucking boyfriend. You will get for this! I will strangle you! You should know that if you have intended to harm yourself- -then girls from here get no treatment- - at the expense of patients on the waiting list. So don't try anything. You're lucky you didn't get a worse punishment. - Stick! Leave me alone! - Unwind! No, let me out! That's our pet. It eats everything, even bathtub stoppers. You get to go ahead today, since you're new here. I can take my bath later. - What's going on here? - Nothing. Hurry up a bit, and don't get wet everywhere. Ten minutes to lock down, girls! Help, the bath water! Eddie, turn off the faucet. Come down here and clean up after yourselves! Come now! Someone has peed on the floor. You should have been in ten minutes ago. In with you, Lucy. Eva! It's Molly! Come to the window. - I love you, Eva! - I love you too, Molly! Does anyone have something sweet I can lick? I'd give you a lick, if you weren't Phylis! Sleep tight! - Are you going to work when you get out? - Work? Hardly. - You earn more by stealing. - What did you say? You earn more by stealing. You should know that. Eva! It's Molly! Come to the window. - I love you, Eva! - I love you too, Molly! - Eval - What? - It's coming down. - Okay. - I'll have my smoke tomorrow. - Okay. - Don't forget it. - No. Carol! - Where is Carol? - She's not feeling well. Wait! I have a message for her. It might put her in a better mood. A special letter from a special friend. - Will you read it to me? - Yes, of course. "Dear Carol. Do you want us to be friends?" "Real friends. T.D.S.O.Å" - What does it mean? - Till death do us apart. "Give me a sign tomorrow. K..E." "Love forever, Eddie." Carol! I will protect you! Let us out. You are ten minutes late. - Yes Yes. - You make such a noise in here. Breakfast is served in a quarter of an hour. Stop begging for cigarettes, Glennis. - You'll die of cancer before you're 18. - I'll die if I don't have a smoke. Now stop playing the martyr. You're staying, so you might as well make the most of it. If you just keep calm, you should be fine. - Do you have any cunts left? - No, and you don't smoke in here. - I'm not in. - Yes, you are, and you smoke. No, I'm symmetrical. One half is in, and the other is out. Half of the smokers are outside, so I don't smoke in it. No, but the ash you spill can go in, right? You're absolutely guaranteed! Sitting there and cleaning the walls. - Bathing twice a day. - Three times, if I may ask. But I'm clean, while you're a pig. Yes, yes talk on... - Do you have any cunts left? - Be careful not to anger me today. You missed a bit there. I love you, Alice. I'm going to put Carol in there for what she's done. Ready Set Go! She's my roommate, but that's also all we share. - Her cleaning obsession drives me crazy.. - What did you go there for, Eddie? A little check forgery and theft. I broke into rich people and took some valuables. I pretended I lived there. Sometimes I stayed all night, while the family slept. I couldn't resist it. I fell asleep in the last place. - What happened? - The man in the house knocked me down. He apologized later. He thought I was a guy. - Can you fight? - I've never tried. I fight. - Do your parents write to you? - I have none. I believe you. My parents turned away from me when I ended up here. No one ever sends anything. I have to make do with what I earn here. So I try to pull in a little extra. Maybe you can help me. In return, I protect you. It is important to have friends here. When I call your name, you line up. Eddie, Sandy, Vicky, Glennis, Mac, Carol. Debbie, Siobhan, Molly, Hilary, Gwen, Kathleen, Pam and Mary. You are going to the factory. Doreen and Sharon have kitchen duty. Louise, Julie and Kate, you have the farm. Stick together and follow me. Get up, breakfast, work, eat, lock up, exercise -more work, tea, into the room, watch TV- -lock up again, turn off the light, play with yourself until three o'clock. Get up, breakfast, work, eat, lock up, exercise -more work, tea, into the room, watch TV- -lock up again, turn off the light, play with yourself until three o'clock. Hurry up, girls. Otherwise, you won't have time to exercise, but must stay in the room. You have no idea what I can do. - Then that's enough. - You can never have enough of that. Are you jealous? Have you not received anything for a long time? - Note. - Damn you! - One more note. - Get your ass! There will be fines and penalties. Food in the room. - Suck on the nipples! - It will be worst for yourself. - She's just stressed, miss. - In with you! - Let her go, miss. - Stupid sub! - Can I have my cigarettes? - Do as you usually do, beg for one. Thanks for letting me off farm duty. It's not a nice job with all those piles of shit. Are you done, Glennis? - I just wanted to say that... - Farm service tomorrow again, okay? Anyone want to buy a pen? Glennis! - Tell me a story, Glennis. - The jaw. Use your jaws, Glennis. Am I the only one who has had a life outside? - It's always me. - Liven up the place, Glennis. Take one of your specials! Okay. I used to date a guy who was in juvenile detention. It wasn't as tough as here, and they had really good jobs. No factory work and crap like that. He worked on a farm. They had twenty-five pigs. He loved the pigs. He went absolutely crazy with them. He gave them different names, one he called Glennis. - We can understand that. - Shut up. I thought it was cute of him. One day when he comes to the farm, he sees something strange some distance away. "What the hell is that?" he thinks. When he arrives, he sees a guy doing it with a pig. He went completely crazy, because he really loved the pigs. So he smashed the guy's skull in. Who wouldn't have? - It was good, Glennis. - What bullshit. - Do you think the pig died? - No, it liked it. There was a hell of a cackle here. - A note for foul words. - Thanks, Mac. Why should we make everything boring? It's the same job you did before you came here, isn't it? You are not here to learn how to become minister's wives. - Speed ​​up now. - Damn important petter. - Arrogant bastard. - He thinks with his balls. Guys! They only think about one thing. Mom's new man was on me as soon as she turned her back. He always tried to touch my breasts. And walked around with a router. But when the mother came home, he was very nice. I couldn't tell her. I was afraid of hurting her. Would that be terrible? The mother knew me and the father. He had me before I even started school. They should be castrated. I put him there. He got two years behind bars. But the mother never forgave me. She locked me out. So here I am, with a bunch of psychopaths. I hate it when someone yells at me. Damn pigs! Wouldn't you want us in your power? Come on, show us what you are! Prove you're a man you big fat bastard. - Take it easy. - You think you're something, huh? You are totally worthless! Is this what you want? Do you want it, you perverted pigs? - Stupid idiot! - Stay out. Shut up, stupid cunt. Now Carol will get a rod. I promised I'd get you. The clock! Here you go, your subs! Be nice, Carol! Turn off! Come here! What the hell are you doing? You will get for this! Take her away! You all get reprimanded, and get locked up for the rest of the day! Come now. You will catch a cold. Why did you do that? In with you. No. - What happened to your arms? - I have cut myself. - How? - With pieces of metal, knives, scissors. There I had three needles under the skin. - How can you do something like that? - That's what I thought too. It's strange what you do when you've been here for a while. It's about prestige. Reputation. You get respect when you look like this. - Do you understand? - No, I don't understand that. No! It's your own fault. Walk properly. Your sub! - Let me go! - Quiet. No please, no syringe. Let it go, I don't want to! I feel nauseous. This time you really managed to cross the line. Who cares? No, the girls are not allowed to wear gym clothes to the concert. If there is a concert. And the pigeon has to get out, this isn't a zoo. It was a young man from St. Paul he had absolutely no scruples he grimaced when he talked and farted when he walked and at night he threw it over the wall In with the skulls. Package on the way. Have fun. - Be quiet, I'm trying to sleep. - Stop it. - Eve! I love you. - I love you too. Be quiet now so I can get some sleep! - Carol...Carol! - I love you! - Eve. One more "Eva" and I'll rip the mouse off you! Okay, girls, no bullshit now. Consider yourself defeated, okay? Now he's big, but the air is probably getting out of hand. The nuns sent this. Alice is fine. Thank you, miss. - It's too short. - It's a rosary. Here you are not allowed to wear things around your neck. Do you think I would hang myself with a rosary? - Write and thank them. - I'll do that. Don't do anything now. Shut up, you sub. This is personal. I'm a whore, but not a subba. Suit yourself or you'll get smacked. I'll kill you when I get hold of you, you flathead! Fight. There will be reporting. I didn't fight. I fell. The inspector has one more thing to investigate tomorrow. You can't punish me for fighting alone. Take her down. Darling! This is discrimination! Do you remember me? I am your mother. Your dear mother. Your own mother. If you call me mom, you get the doll. Such a cute doll. You get it, if you call me mom. Fuck off! Stick! An innocent story. An old sailor sat on a rock he waved his fist and was fierce with his... ...a neighbor on the farm watched his race and taught their young to play with their… ...marbles and lots of it then there came a woman who looked like a… ...nice young woman who looked like a hillbilly she claimed to have invented a new way to… ...get bam and she made it big the farmhands shoveled... ...sort of like the pigs of the pig pen where chewing animals and the gentleman felt like… ...the horses were walking in the pasture outside their house his wife sat in the boudoir powdering her... What did you think I would have said? The story has now come to an end - A big round of applause for Mac! - A fist in the ass! - Hello, girls and boys. - Hello. Has anyone seen my woman, Judy? - Judy. - Judy! Judy, have you been to the bathroom? - I am every morning. - What's that smell, Judy? She is the one who smells! - Where is the smell coming from, Judy? - It's the forehead. Bring it here or I'll slap you in the face! - No you do not. - Yes I do. - No you do not. - Yes I do. - No you do not. - No, I do not. Yes you do. - What should I do with it? - What you will do? What will she do with it, child? - Eat it! - Sprinkle sugar over it! No! Turn this way and you'll see where to throw it. On the flat. One Two Three! Wait. One more. It was disgusting. In with you. Come here. Get down from the chair. Mary. Get down from the chair. Go back to the cell. It's not like you to cry. It's no fun to rot here, or to get shit in the face. - I've been through worse things. - What? - Just don't take it personally. - What? I do not know. I used to steal things from the maternity store. After a week I went back and said I had miscarried. They gave me the money back, even though they don't really get it. - What happened next? - The store detective exposed me. He said so that everyone could hear: "That must be your fourth miscarriage this year, and we're only in April". All the women threw themselves at me and started beating me. Talk about being chased out of town. - I call that humiliation. - But they didn't throw shit at you. No. Is that you, Mac? - What are you doing? - Takes a cigarette, checks the situation. Can't you sing a song? I was once a pickpocket, I stole everywhere but then I was caught and locked up here I'm glad I got caught because when I get out I show the police where I learned to steal I happily go out into the world and forge checks - Good then? - Thanks. You can choose this. You may get a cross at the eyebrow. It's for the tough. "XAB": Ex-institutional bride. F. Off" You recognize it. "Fuck the system". It is popular. "I hate »0", on the arm. Anything that isn't difficult to spell. No I promise. - Does that hurt? - It's done. - Do you want it or not? - Okay. But stop if I say so. - I want: "I love...". -Where? - Here. - It will sting. - That's where I want it. - Okay. "I love".. who? This is Dr. Siles, our psychiatrist. His treatment is voluntary. I haven't had a chance to greet you. The girls call the department the "Love Department". We have group therapy to- -understanding ourselves and others- -and learn to endure. - I love that word, "energy". - Do you? Try to understand other people's situation, and how they feel. Try to understand other people's situation, and how they feel. You keep talking about coping, but I don't want to cope. I want to be with my daughter. To "cope" is an insult. Just let me know if you want to join. Just let me know if you want to join. I almost can't wait. Stick, Mac. - Two minutes, Eddie. -30 seconds. She is not the Mona Lisa. Stick! Stick! Remember smoked. Come on. We will give back to Sharon. She is watching TV. Come now! Who feels sexy? Please, Eddie. Do not. Stop it, Eddie. Let it go, Eddie. I'm bored. The problem is that when you are bored, you get into fights. Who did it? Then say it! I LOVE EDDIE I LOVE EDDIE Wait! Would this prepare me for working life outside? Then you have something to focus your energy on. It makes one feel unnecessary. Then you realize what the goal of life is. Then you realize what the goal of life is. I'd rather be a whore than a cleaning lady. - Were you really a freak? - Yes, and I'm proud of that. Are you having fun? Hurry up now. Hurry up now. Is the lady sulking? I miss my child. I miss my child. The lady will soon be on someone! A chocolate egg and some baby powder. A chocolate egg and some baby powder. - Two bars of soap. - She'll eat it enough. The usual. - You come from here in a wooden box. - Yes, miss. - You come from here in a wooden box. - Yes, miss. - The sooner the better, Glennis. - Yes thank you. Hair wax, tobacco and a chocolate egg. - What is it? - That's my problem. Close your eyes. - Thanks. - It was nothing. - Thanks. - It was nothing. Consider it my parting gift. Time is up, girls. - Eddie! - What is it? - Eddie! - What is it? - We sing for you. - Good, you horny girls. Good luck, may God bless you and guide you to the right path and guide you to the right path Good luck, may God bless you that's all we have to say Wherever you wander, as long as we are apart Good luck, may God bless you Good luck, may God bless you and keep you in our hearts Eddie! We sesitoloway. ...taking poor Eddie along There stands Eddie with tears in his eyes There stands Eddie with his legs apart I say oh, oh, oh, I sing the prison blues Eddie, I love you dearly I will always be faithful to you So give me a lick and not a pick then I will always love you Here it comes, Eddie. Call if you need a safe blaster. You get my last cig. It's true love, so enjoy it. You get my last cig. It's true love, so enjoy it. - Thanks. - Now don't forget your friends. I feel like it says "juvenile institution" on my forehead. I feel like it says "juvenile institution" on my forehead. I don't know anyone outside. - All my friends are here. - You don't want to go back in, do you? Go now. Carol has walked through the kitchen. Alone? - Look, what I have for you. - Nice. - Look at the back. - Did you write it yourself? - Look at the back. - Did you write it yourself? - How is it going? - It works. - What are they doing to you, mother? - Nothing. It's a kind of vacation. - Do you want a cup of tea? - Thanks. - What a sweet little boy. - I'm not a boy. - Why is she here? - Sorry, Annetta. - What has she done? - Nothing. - Why is she here then? - She is one of mother's friends. What is that under her arm? What is it? It's just a roll of writing paper. She stuck with Carol with whom I share a cell. She has a baby at home. She has a baby at home. - You're lucky you're going home. - How happy I am. Stupid subba, why did you sell them? You knew I'd use them when I got out. Stay out! - It's gone. - Leave it now, Kathy. Kathleen! Annette Brady. Annette Brady. We had hoped that after your stay here- -would be able to take on the role of mother again. The authorities have not been able to find the child's father. I understand that you don't know where he is either. I therefore see no other possibilities- -than the authorities find a foster family. And after this accident, she will probably be adopted. Bring her back to the cell. Ten days of solitary confinement, Miss Holly, and produce Howden's journal. - I have heard what has happened. - Yes. Now it's over. I have to do it. It was horrible, and I know it was wrong. - Can you do me a favor? - What? - You say no. - What is it? I want to meet Carol. - I knew you would say no. - Why, Annetta"? She can help me find Frank, Alice's father. If they find him, they won't take her. I need to talk to Carol. - I'll see what I can do. - Thanks. - I want my medicine. - You have to wait a bit. I need your help, Carol. You wrote down the phone number of Frank's friend. - What was his name? - How will she remember it? She wrote the number on the wall. I'm sorry, Annetta. You have to remember that, Carol. A girl came home from the youth institution and discovered that her beloved had left her she asked why he went his way he answered her these words you could have become my wife if only you lived a decent life but you chose a life of crime so now go in and take your punishment then you wish for a better life without crime so never choose that path which leads to the gate of the youth institution Welcome to the institution, the food here is good a pea fell from the table and killed my friend I'm tired of life in an institution I'd much rather go home It is said that in the institution you get a good salary they pay 30p a week but get 29 back I'm tired of life in an institution I'd much rather go home I have signed up for the choir. - Why? - So I'm going to heaven. - I want to see that before I believe it. - We probably won't meet up there.
