Roma! Roma! Roma! So you have a furniture company. Romolo Pinzabanchi. Nice to meet you. I’m a lawyer. I didn't get married because I'm a big fan of the Roma soccer team. They say wives are so nice, but they are a pain in the ass. - Is it true? - My wife knows. When Inter plays, we eat out because our maid leaves. Then she goes to the movies and I go to the stadium. - Do you live far away? - Yes. I walk to the stadium. I live at Corso di Porta Romana 132. By metro it takes me a minute. Go Roma! Go wolves! - Excuse me. - No, come on! Look, me too. Go Inter! Come on, Inter! Roma! Roma! Go wolves! It’s a game. Tassinelli. Here it is. Come on! It’s silver, yes. What’s this stick? I’ll throw it in. And this? Silver, I’ll put it in. A lot of silverware! Nice! And here? What’s there? Pearls! I will go on vacation with this loot! The linens... I don’t need them. What’s here? What is this? Who is this? Oh my god, who is this? Come on, go in. Don’t stay there. I want you so bad, and you? And you? Yes, you too. We’ll talk later. It’s just you and I, like many other times. It will be beautiful, as usual. I see it in your eyes. Good. Good, come on! Yes. I'm even forced to be the third wheel, here! Good for you! Oh, come on... Oh, my God, she’s dead! Son of a bitch! Excuse me, who are you? Why are you running? Mrs.! Mrs. Elena! Help! Get him! He killed Mrs. Elena! - Porter, get him! - Where are you going? - Let go of me! - He killed Mrs. Elena! I was just passing by! What have I done? - Let go of me! Fuck you! - He’s a murderer! Angela, your grandma is deaf, but... Knowing that she shakes like that, I wouldn’t have come to get her. I promised her that she’d help deliver the first child. - And I’ll keep my promise. - It’s also my son. I’m worried, she can’t even hold the rosary bead right. Don’t worry. She’s a good midwife, she helped deliver every child in my family. If she lets him fall, he will end up like your cousin, Omelet Brain! Get that car moving! - I’m driving a pregnant lady. - We are not escorting a hearse. Yes, it's your funeral, you son of a bitch! You're absurd! My God, a dog! Stop! Fuck it! You were hitting that poor dog, you scared me. Me too, I thought the baby was coming and you were in labor. What labor? - It’s not my fault. - Don’t move! Nico, stop. I crave rock salad. - Touch your ass. - What? Do you want our baby to have a rock salad birthmark? - Did you find it? - I found shit! Grandma says that she can slice a little bit of salami for you. Are you crazy today? Your grandma’s hands shake so much that she could hurt herself. All right. I picked the child’s name. Really? What name? - Rocky. - Why? I want him to be a winner from the start. My son will have an Italian name. Why are you talking so low? What are you saying? We are talking about the child’s name! Let’s call him Giovanni Paolo, like the Pope. You prefer the name of a Polish man over an American name? - He’s name will be Rocky. - I like Lucia. - What's Lucia got to do with it? - It may be a girl. No! In my family we are all males, even the girls. Is this the same story of the oven and the baker? A train can’t run without the locomotive. A locomotive can’t move without a piston. But it’s a month that you don’t use it! - Damn it! - What? They don’t leave me alone not even when I’m on vacation. - Who are they? - My colleagues. I know this car’s noise. Gargiulo will come and say: "Marshal Giraldi!" - Marshal Giraldi! - Here he goes. - Hi, Nico. - Hi, what’s wrong? - Actually... - You have such faces! We need your help. - Why did you get a dog? - Mind your business. - Come, we must talk. - Marshal. - Good morning, Mrs. - Officer. Listen... Where did your husband go? Where else could he go? They arrived. Those pains in the ass! To Mass? I’m not going to Mass. Grandma, Nico’s squad arrived here. They gave us this RV and now they ruin our holiday. Show them your "ID", if they ask you. - What are you saying? - Lay down. Now I have to eat like this. Did you come here so that I could tell you to fuck off? I have a deaf wife and a pregnant grandma. I mean, the other way around. I’m on vacation. - But I was saying... - There’s something you don’t know. - What? - When my vacation is over I’ll quit my job and open a detective agency. This has nothing to do with what I came to tell you. Windy wasn’t arrested for robbery but for murder. I don’t believe you. This is why you are needed in Milan. Windy will speak with you only. He’s accused of strangling a woman to rob her. Don’t say bullshit, this isn’t true. Once his mother asked him to kill a chicken. - He couldn’t do it. - Now you must come with me. - You’ll take the plane to Milan. - Are you going to Milan? They want me to go. - Windy is in trouble. - What do you care about him? He’s a son of a bitch but he’s a friend. I apologize, but you know our job. You apologize? Fuck you! He’s a detective, not just a dick. - Come on! I don’t understand... - When do we have to leave? - In an hour. - I’ll go home then. - Fine. - Can you drive an RV? Can you take my wife back to Rome? This is a special vehicle. When it stops, you punch the dashboard three times, kick the stick once, scream "fuck you" twice, and it'll start again. Sit. Who’s this? - Marshal Giraldi, at your order. - Sit down. Thank you. There’s traffic also in Milan. You put your feet on the table? Are you crazy? Americans do it all the time! We are in Italy. Put them down, you’ll dirty the table. Don’t get upset, I’ll clean. It was dirty before too. It’s a lot of dust! Marshal, from the moment you landed at the Milan airport, you're working for me, therefore you will have to listen to me because this is my case. I ask the questions, I’ll make the conclusions. What the fuck am I doing here, then? They told me that you use a peculiar vocabulary. But you will have to tone it down with me. - Got it? - You made me come here... because you found out that the guy who is in jail, Windy Bertarelli, was born in my neighborhood. So... This is how we speak in my neighborhood. If you need a more elegant person, someone dressed as chic as you, who wears a tie, you must find someone more refined to get those mother fuckers who take money from the people. This is why people like Windy and me couldn’t go to school and learn a polite language like yours. - Don’t speak demagogy to me! - I'm not! - But I’m not a "demajerk" either. - Marshal! - Your excellency. - What excellency! - Your highness. - No! Holiness, Eminence... How should I call you? Dicktator? Enough! You have crossed the line. Go to San Vittore prison, talk to the prisoner and then report your conversation to me. Is it clear? Clear. Ultra clear. It can’t be any clearer than that. - I’d like to point out something. - Tell me. - With me, try not to get P.O. - What? Pissed off. I have good intentions, I don’t go around wasting my day. I killed those three because I promised them. I’m Bartolo from Monza, I always keep my word. I can’t wait to get out. No, you’ll get a life sentence, like me. So stick with me, I’m the best suitor here. - What suitor? - Don’t play the fool. - Stick with me, you’ll be a queen. - Many are better than me here. Rubbish! I saw you under the shower. You’re chunky, soft, you have no hair. It was love at first sight. I come from a good family, I don’t like such things. What are you talking about? You offend me like this! - I saw you speaking with another. - You’re wrong. You can either be mine or no one's. If I can’t have you, no one will. Bartoluccio, let’s write to my mother. Let’s ask her consent. Give me the address, we’ll write. Let’s do nothing until my mother answers. - Just a goodnight kiss. - Bertarelli to the visiting room! They called me, excuse me. Bye, pretty piece of ass! Didn’t you hear them talk? I just heard her voice. - You didn’t see them? - I was under the bed. I saw his foot when he was putting his shoes on. - Did he wear a ring? - A ring on his toe? Windy, don’t be a dick. You need hands to put shoes on. I didn’t understand. Could I get probation? No, even if they found you not guilty for the murder, you would still be here for theft. - But I didn’t steal anything. What did you go to that house for, then? For a general cleaning? Try to make this big head of yours work. I need a clue and I don’t have time to waste! I got it! He had a big scar on his foot. - On the right heel. - Is this a clue? I’d have to make everybody show me their foot? Marshal, help me out. I share the prison cell with a guy named Bartolo. He wants to do me, I can’t sleep at night. I always keep my back to the wall. You didn’t see anything, or hear anything. So? So, you must take it in the ass! Did they take your house keys at the stadium? Yes, it’s true. When you went to the stadium, what did your wife do? She’d go to the movie theater with some friends. Elena, why? Elena dear, why? Be strong! - Were you married a long time? - Yes. - Was everything fine? - What do you mean? - Did you fuck every day? - I ask the questions! If you don’t ask certain questions, I'll have to. - Blow. - When you’re done, I can start. I’m cleaning his nose. A little bit of mercy! Do you have a frozen meatball instead of a heart? I’m not dirtying anything, I’m using the mat. When and how did you meet your wife? She was a nurse at San Filippo Hospital. I went there after I broke my leg skiing and so we met. Did someone know her well at the hospital? Let me ask the questions! Ask him if someone at the hospital knew the victim. Did someone know the victim well at the hospital? Everybody, but Elena mostly worked with the head nurse. Wait, let me get a pen. - What’s his name? - Enrico Vitucci. Excuse me, listen, look... I don’t excuse, I don’t listen, I don’t look. Did you look the x rays well? I know more than the doctor. - I’m allergic to... - Stop talking. Damn! Thank God we always have to be formal or I’d tell you what a jerk you are. - But, listen... - Know why I didn’t get a degree? - Because my mom run away. - Call a doctor. - Nurse Vitucci. - Where do I have to put a cast on? - Up my ass if you please. - What? I’m pissed because I’m here like a turd for someone who is a bigger piece of shit than me. - Beg your pardon? It’s the police. But I... I’m investigating the murder of someone who worked here. Elena Tassinelli, Elena Montesi Tassinelli. I heard she died, she was very beautiful. I told here not to get married, and always stay here, she was the angel of the sick. And of the nurses. She was precise in her work. She was fascinating, sometimes I’d buy her coffee and sometimes we’d go together to the movies on Sunday. Talking about Sunday... Last Sunday, between 3 to 4... - Where were you? - Why do you ask? You said you’d take her to the movies on Sunday and you’d buy her coffee and ice cream and maybe more... Maybe she went out with someone else and that pissed you. - What do you mean? - I’ll tell you later, now answer. Last Sunday I was working here. At the maternity ward, from 12 to midnight. Maternity! I must call my wife. Where’s the phone? There. Don’t smoke. It’s forbidden here. - How to make a call here? - Press the green button. Here we go. I need to call Rome. You shouldn’t do it, but there’s a trick. Press the red button with the other hand. This? - I did it. - Now press 06 and then the number. Using my dick? I’ll give you a cup of broth. It’s good for you and the baby. Don’t worry, I’ll help you. - Hello? - Hi. Nico! Finally! When are you coming back? I don’t know. There’s much to do here, it’s just the beginning. Do you have to work? I’m eight months pregnant, remember? If you don’t come back, I’ll make you two girls! Don’t you dare! I want a boy with a big cock. How boring! I won’t open to anyone, I won’t get in the mood... Don’t get in the mood as well. - Are you jealous? - Yes, you’re naughty. I want you so bad, I’m going crazy. I’m tired of hand jobs! Don’t say such things on the phone. Here. What happened? Are you in labor? Angela! No, don’t worry. It was grandma. She spilled broth on me. - And the baby is kicking. - He isn’t kicking. Rocky is training! Nico, I’ll hand you grandma. Don’t do it, she’s deaf. You scream, she’ll have fun. Wait, grandma. Nico, I’ll pass you grandma. - Here, grandma. - Hello? - Grandma, it's Nico. It's Nico! The line dropped, I can’t hear anything. Want some broth? No, let’s go to the kitchen. What a mess she made! I got injured playing hockey. Why did you want to see my feet? - Your feet saved you. - Why? I suspected you. You’re wrong, I loved Elena like a sister. - Nurse, you can’t leave like that. - Enough! - I’m talking to the police. - I know, but... - Hello, Ambrogi. - Hello. Listen, Marshal, come here. The guy with the mustache who’s speaking to the nurse is Roberto Ambrogi. He's a forward for the Varese Hockey team. He was in love with Elena. - He lost his mind. - Yes. Listen, I can’t go on with my arm like that. - It’s all over. - Yes! Hi, Roberto. I’m Marshal Giraldi. I’m investigating the murder of Elena Tassinelli. You can investigate as much as you want, but I know who is the murderer. - Name, last name and address. I’ll never tell the police. I don’t have evidence but I know who did it. I’ll strangle him, with my hands. Don’t you dirty your hands. Let me do this. Name, last name and addresses. I play at 4 in Varese, I must go. I’m not going to tell you, but I’ll get him. Goodbye. Who wouldn’t kill him... Killing a lovely creature like our sweet Elena... That’s Professor Baldi, he knew Elena well too. Marshal Giraldi is investigating the murder. - Giraldi Nico, from Rome. - Nice to meet you. Elena was my assistant for a long time. I found in her a good, sweet soul. She was serene, a wonderful woman. What I don’t understand is... Why everybody is saying that she was a wonderful pious, generous person? Last Sunday she was fucking like a slut! Sometimes you people from the police just don’t get it. You don’t seem smart. We try to be smart to fight against all these smart asses! The murderer is that thief that they found in the house. And he came up with the story of the lover. Vitucci is right I agree with him. You’re wrong, that thief is a friend of mine. He’s a good person. He’s a good thief. A thief is a person as well. I’m sure he’s innocent. Those who take a shit in the snow, even if they dig a hole for it, when the snow melts, the shit comes out. - It has been nice to meet you. - Goodbye. - I’m going, goodbye. - Bye, Marshal. Bye. - What are you doing? - Tell me the suspect’s name. You’re that cop! I won’t tell you. - Come on, Ambrogi! - Go to hell! Do we have to keep playing this game or will you speak? Why don’t you want to tell me that name? Did you have a relationship with Elena? Not at all. She liked to fuck someone else. - The guy you’re protecting. - Go away! - Did you killed Elena? - No. - Confess. - It wasn’t me. - Who was it? - Elena... Where are you going? You can’t be on stage. - I’m a policeman. Who are you? - I’m the stage director. If it’s about the drugs, it wasn’t me. I’ve already told the detective, I didn’t put it in my pocket. I don’t care about that. There’s a girl here who knew Roberto Ambrogi, who played for Varese. Yes, it’s Antonella. - That one? - No, she’s in that dressing room. - Should I come with you? - No, I’ll go alone. Not three, I’m alone. Who are you? I’m Marshal Giraldi. What do you want? Well, I... I want many things... But I’d like to talk about Roberto Ambrogi. Poor Roberto! I heard he died. I’m very sorry. Some nights we got out... We went out to booze. To booze or for your boobs? - Yes. - Huh, I like those! Now that I think about it... I should renew my permit to stay. I’d give it to you day and night, and after lunch and dinner and snacks. You’re beautiful. Marshal... you’re very horny. It’s two months I don’t make love. I’m more horny that a horny hornet. You understand? Yes. Would you let me get your boobs too? Let's do it then, let me get your boobs! Come closer, throw your boobs on me. - Tight! - Yes, your thighs, your tits, your ass... Everything. Is this what you were doing! Thighs, tits and ass! This is why you didn’t want to come back. What are you talking about? I’m busy working. You were getting busy with this whore! - Angela... - Watch your mouth! - I’m an artist. - Yes, a cock artist! Why the fuck do you have to be so vulgar? You make me look shitty. I make you look shitty? Fuck you! - Let’s go. - Go away! My respects. - Come. - Let go of me! - I was working. - Dirty bastard! - Filthy pig! - You’re exaggerating. We weren’t in bed. How did you find us? Stop making a mess. We have an audience here! - They are just here to jerk off. - You’re wrong... - Stop, don’t you dare. - Yes. Leave my wife alone. Let’s go. - What’s going on? - Come on, there’s a show! - Let go of me! - Come on! - What’s wrong with you? - I have the right, I’m your wife. You don’t have to cheat on me. Dirty, filthy bastard! - You forgot one. - Pig! - Now it’s fine. - Yes. You came all the way here from Rome like this? It doesn’t bother me to drive, your betrayals bother me. What are you talking about? She was dating a suspect who died today. And you were burying him between her legs! I was investigating! - You were fucking her. - No! I work like an ass! You don’t call your wife an ass. I call him an ass. Stop making a scene! I don't know where to park the RV. If you do me a favor, I'll park it in my yard. A yard? You gave me an idea. Here, for the cigarettes. These are matches. - You’re good. - Thank you. - I can even guess your name. - And what’s my name? You are Fiorella Colombo. Right, how do you know? You’re the little girl who saw the Roman thief coming out of Tassinelli’s house. - Yes! Listen, I’m a policeman. I'm Marshal Giraldi. Did you see Elena Tassinelli coming home with someone? No, when I passed by, the gate was closed. Did you see if... Wait. Jerk! Fuck you! You and your roller skates! Make way! Excuse me, I’m sorry! It’s you again! On skates and in the street! What is this mess? I was chasing the murderer's car and this dick head blocked my way. Watch your mouth, this is my wife. - Not this, she’s a bitch. - That’s my sister. You’re related to every bitch in Milan! - Cockhold! - coward! - Did he hurt you? - It was a regular kick. Fuck him! You came on the field and your team will be disqualified. You won't, and remember... Whoever touches my man will get beaten up. Don’t spend time with these savages, you have a gentle soul. I’m just a pure soul. I want to stay a virgin and never get married. What do you mean? Unless I find the man of my dreams. Here I am! Let’s get transferred to a penitentiary by the sea. - We’ll get a double cell. - A double? - For us? - Yes. We’ll pay the mortgage and pay the cell. - Yes. - What a pleasure! I must free you, the murderer checks every move. He killed Ambrogi when he was about to say his name. We need a bait to make him strike again and we’ll catch him. You’re the bait. We’ll say that you were under the bed and saw him. I should be bait? No, I rather be in jail. I’ll start a family with Bartolo. He’s nice man and a good worker. You’ll do what I say, all right? I don’t have time to waste, my wife is about to give birth. Now go back and eat a piece of soap. Your mother wrote back, she approves of our wedding. - Really? - Yes, read it. "Dear Bartolo Monzese..." "I got your letter today and I was weary moved." Weary? - Very! - "Very moved as I hope the same for you and my son Franco." "I love him very much." "I’m glad about your proposal, I'm glad he'll settle down and start a family." "I give you my blessing and I wish you’ll make me many grandchildren." "Your loving mother in law, Clelia Marchetti." "Widow Moriconi, Proietti and Bertarelli." - Did you hear? - Yes. - She wants grandchildren. - We’ll adopt them. We’ll talk to Don Murialdo. The one who killed people with poisonous hosts. We’ll get married. He’s here too. He’s here too? I’m glad. Yes, let’s have him marry us and tonight... My mom! Oh my god! What a pain! I already feel pregnant. Marshal Giraldi, what are you doing? You can’t eat here. - What should I do? Want some? - No, thank you. - Drink. - I’m on duty. Right. - What is he saying? - He said something and he’s right. We can't camp in the police station yard. Where could we go? You can’t park in the city. You hang up the laundry! This is the police station’s yard! Where should I hang them up? Whenever you have a difficult job you always call my husband. And you don't even pay for his housing. - He's not a super hero! - Angela! - Nico! - Don’t scream! Taste the sauce, tell me if it’s fine. Some chili pepper... Careful! - Excuse me, I’ll clean. - Enough! - This is too much. - Calm down. When the murderer will find out that Bertarelli is in the hospital and can recognize him... - Go to hell! - I’m trying to solve the mistery. - Yes, I see it. With your ideas, there’s always someone killed, like Ambrogi. - His fault, he should have answered. - No, get better information. Ambrogi worked for Busoni, a moneylender, who owns a club. He would get the clients to pay back their debt. - That fat one is the moneylender. - Yes. Help, Nico! - Help! - Are you in labor? No, the dog ate all the bologna. Don’t worry, he’s a well trained dog. He’s well trained, but I’m not. - It’s German. - Take it away. - Do you feel sick? - No, everything is fine. - Should I cook the pasta? - Yes, I’m coming. She cooks pasta? Where are we? In Italy. You told me when I put my feet on the desk. Enough! Now tell me. Are you sure that Bertarelli, that close friend of yours, will be able to play his part? - I hope so. Help! I got poisoned! - Guards, come! - What’s going on? - Help! - Oh, my God! - Good heavens! - Take him to the infirmary. - Oh, my God! - Hurry! Good heavens! Listen, I won’t pay you full price. - Why? - You didn’t take off your bra. They're not fully grown. When they grow, I'll give you full pay and move better, you're so stiff. You must be more sexy! Let them see what a woman looks like. He’s right, you know about it. It’s you again? Why are you here? - I have a voucher. - Ah, the police. - Can we talk? - Of course. - Shall we go? - Come. Here’s the comedian, Picchio Picchio Piripicchio! Don’t make noises, there’s a show. - Can we seat here? - Yes. Take off your right shoe. - A shoe? - Yes, and also the sock. Let me see. You didn’t kill her. - Kill who? - Elena. Who knows how many people got killed by your men. Me? I have no men. After all, one must get his money back. - Now I’m sick of you. - What? - No! What do you want to do? - Now undress yourself. - Me? - Yes. - Isn’t this a stripper club? - Of course, for ladies. - Undress yourself, then. - Yes. - The jacket. - Take it all off or I’ll kill you. And now, Damiana Sinclair’s beautiful body! Move, be more sexy. Shake that ass. - Here, for the coffee. - Thank you. This is sugar, I have diabetes. Good evening. - What are you doing here? - Is this car yours? - Yes, is there something wrong? - Yes. Yes, when you use it to kill someone. I don’t know what you are talking about. I must go home. Hurry. Give me the key. I must check the trunk and see if you have a rifle. - Do you have a warrant? - No. You can’t search the car, then. Let’s go to the police station, you’re under arrest. - Do you have a warrant? - You won't let me do anything? - No. - I see. You are one of those who need a warrant. Let me warn you then: I’m about to tell you to fuck off. - Mr. Esposti. - Go to the other entrance. My husband and his guest will be half an hour late. But I don’t want you to wait any longer, I’ll have the lunch served. - What’s your name? - Bianca. - And your Dad? - Candido. - Is he in the black market? - Not at all. Everything is white! - Bianca! - Yes, madame. My husband will be late. - You can serve lunch. - Miss. I know you. Of course you know me, I’m Marshal Giraldi. Remember when you fell? Yes, I do. I brought you this plant so you’d forgive me. - For you. - Divine! My husband never gave me not even a daisy. Not even lilies? Marshal, you are so wild! You're so funny. Come, I’ll introduce you to my friends. Yes. Bianca, hide it. I took it from the hall. This is Marshal Giraldi. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Who’s that Marshal? - He works with my brother. He’s investigating the Porta Romana murder. Thank you. Thank you! Another one. There’s something to drink as well. Marshal... Do you like this music? - What’s its name? - Schubert incomplete symphony. - Why is it incomplete? - He didn’t finish writing it. We got lucky then! - We are ready. - Good. Lunch is served. Marshal. Marshal! Marshal, lunch. - Come. - Yes. - Please. - Should I sit here? This is so boring! Do you have fun like this? Now I’ll show you how I have fun. Let’s have a toast to warm up the evening. Raise your glasses. Here. Drink it all up, or I’ll surely mess you up! Drink! - Now we are talking. - Marshal. - What, Miss? - This will be a fish dinner. - Do you like it? - What did you make? - Coquilles à la marinière. - That is? Mussels in tomato sauce, do you like it? Mussels? Are you asking me if I like them? Those as big as this? Yes! - What is your astrological sign? - Pisces, my rising sign is Lobster. We don’t eat here? The mussels! I'm so hungry! Wait. Wait, here. Here. Look, how beautiful. Those are fresh, just fished. Very nice. How rude! My brother will get a stroke when he gets here. - Please come in, sir. - Thank you. I’m sure that they have already started eating but that topic was too important. Freedom of speech is fundamental. But now everything is fine. Come, honorable. - Come in. - Thank you. - It’s a cheerful event. - I see. A little too much. I’m very sorry, I’m mortified. Marshal Giraldi! - At your orders. - What are you doing here? I’m trying to entertain your guests who were bored to death. How dare you? - I was... - I gave him permission to dare. Shut up, Esmeralda. Why did you come here? I came... I know who’s the murderer. I need your help. Ask the judge to sign the arrest warrant. I will not help you. I strip you from your rank and I kick you out of my house and from Milan. Go away! You can do whatever you want. But he’s a friend of mine. And if you don't have that arrest warrant signed, I'll fuck with you. - Besom! - I hoped you’d get the 3. I take when I take and I play when I play. - Holy cow! - 4 plus 2 makes 6. Plus 1 is 7. What’s this? The diamond seven! - Another besom. - You’re way too lucky. You gave me three 4. I can’t believe it! - What’s this? - A jack. - And this? - Another jack. This isn’t besom. I’m the best. I’m a champion, you understand? You may be a champion, but when I have to take I take and when I play, I play. - How many besom do you have? - 5 besom plus 4 points. Makes 9. - Nine. - You count well. - Shuffle. I’m someone who likes to play, not a champion like you. I take when I take and I play when I play. - Lift up. - Deal the cards. I go to take a piss. Do things right. I want to see if I can beat him up at least once. 4 plus 3 makes 7. And 2 makes 9. What’s this? - Ace. - And this? A king. Another besom. I’m done playing with you. You may be a champion, But when I play I play and when I take I take. Come on! Don’t get upset, just shuffle and deal the cards. To go to Rome, you must go the other way. - I’ll go to Porta Romana first. - Why? I want to arrest Tassinelli, even without a warrant. Really? All right. - What’s your grandma doing? - She’s resting. I must see Tassinelli’s feet. You think about other people’s feet and not about your wife’s belly. I do think about it, but I have to work! And I must see Windy. First you look at that man’s feet, then you go see Windy... - When will we leave? - It won’t take long. I must take him back to jail. I have: token, diamond ten, cards, diamonds and a besom. I gave you all my money. I never lost so much in my life. - Do you want to bet your watch? - Don’t touch me! - I won’t play with you again. - I wanted you to get even. You play dirty. You take, you play. - You’re a cheater, I saw it. - I won’t take advantage of a gaggio! - What is a gaggio? - A jerk, but in a good way. In a good way? When I get upset I become an animal. I must go now. - I'll go do an IV. - What? No, nothing... I’d do an IV to you, but in the ass and with acid. Fuck you! Fuck you and the whole hospital. Vitucci. Doctor, I'm going to 32 to change the IV. Who’s the prisoner in the cell that you just left? The one who was found in Elena’s house. She was killed two weeks ago. Yes, I remember. Why is he here? What does he have? To be honest... nothing. It must be a set up by the police. He said he’d be able to identity the murderer because he was under the bed when the crime happened and he saw something on his foot, I think a scar. I see. All right, see you later. If someone looks for me, I’m in Radiology. Hi. Why did you want to see my foot? Can you tell me now? Gipsies read hands, I read feet. Could Baldi have used a car with the Swiss plates? Of course, we have a company based in Lugano. The car you saw yesterday belongs to that company. You suspect me. How can you think I’d kill my wife? Also Landru said this and he killed 6 wives. - I’m not Landru and my wife... - Was a little bit of a whore. Hurry. Before getting married, she had an innocent flirt, a sympathy for Doctor Baldi. Then everything ended and they remained friends. I married Elena and Baldi, Professor De Stefanis’ daughter. We used to joke about this thing they had. - What thing... - That flirt. Flirt? Where I’m from, we call it a gang bang. I don’t know if you did it, but there are all the elements to it. There’s you, a business man, married to a pretty nurse. The very rich daughter of an important doctor who agreed to marry the young doctor who wants to climb up. But the rat’s wife, and that is you, got too friendly with the doctor. - What are you talking about? - I know what I’m talking about. - Why are you running so much? - We are going to Windy. - He won’t die if we arrive later. - Maybe he will. My God! Is it the earthquake ? Hello? I’m Professor Baldi. There’s a urgent case. Number 75 must be taken to the surgery room right away. I’ll operate on him immediately. - Why are you speeding like this? - A friend of mine could die! Why did you drink rye? Do you think it’s your fault? He already killed two, he may kill a third one. Careful! Help! Mickey farts on Pluto. Show your ass, I’ll give you a shot. - What do you want? - It's doctor's orders. - Maybe it’s the wrong patient. - Turn around. - No, go away. - Turn around. - No, I won’t. - I’ll do it then. - What are you doing? Let go of me. - Don’t move. Take your hands off of me... - Fuck you! - It’s nothing. This little shot will make you feel better. Feel like a little angel. Why do I have to be calm? You sleep now and when you’ll wake up, you won’t even remember you had surgery. Surgery? Why? Professor Baldi said that, he’ll operate on you. Mitral stenosis. Steno... what? Stenography? But don’t worry. Professor Baldi is very good. He may be good but I don’t care. Where are you taking me? What do you want to do to me? I don't need "stenography". I want my mama. Mama liked the rose! What are you doing? Where are Mickey and Pluto? Mama! Are you undressing me? What are you doing? Where are you putting me? What are you doing? What’s that? Mama? You tie me up? Is Bartolo around? Where’s the wall? You tie me up? Also my arm? You tie me up? What have I done wrong, Mama? You abandoned me. Was I a bad boy? Are you drugging me? What have I done? - Count up to three. - Is it a game? One. Two. Three. Four. Mama! - Here we go. - Yes. - Of course. - I’m in labor! - Are you in labor? - It’s the first time but I think so. - Calm down. - Help me! Stay calm! Nico, help me. Here I am! - Calm down, honey. - Careful. - Here, come on. - My legs are weak. Grandma! Excuse me. Grandma! Vitucci, help me! My wife is giving birth! - What’s going on? - Call my grandma, but scream. - I’ll take care of it. - What’s this mess? Help me! This is a peculiar surgery. It's a mitral stenosis. - Bertarelli? - They are operating on him. - Who? - Professor Baldi. - The surgery room. - Second floor. Scalpel. What’s wrong? You’re crazy. And you’re a murderer. You see criminals everywhere. You’re making a big mistake. Come, I’ll explain everything. Don’t cut him, he’s fine. What’re you doing? My bike! Thief! Are you crazy? Damn it! Don’t listen to him, it’s always the same story. He’s a jerk, he has fun like that! Nico, why are you driving like this? These bumps aren’t good for your wife. Plus I’m working, I can’t leave the hospital! - Shut up! - Dr. Baldi! What are you doing here? - I told you to shut up! - Oh my God! - Are you falling on me? - What are you doing? You’re beautiful! - Beautiful! - Grandma, I’m in labor! - Help! - Yes! Giovanni Paolo is coming! No, Enrico is coming. - As you wish. - Giovanni, Paolo and Enrico? Are they triplets? Help! Help me! We must take the time. - What? - Louder, she’s deaf. We need to take the time! You want a rum with lime? This is not the time for that! I’ll take the time! - Tell me when the next arrives. - What? - Tell me when the next arrives. - What? In between contractions you must tell me... To fuck off! Water! I want water! Give me some water. Grandma, I want water! Yes. My God! - You go, Grandma! - You’re useless. You can’t even pour a glass of water. Water! Take it. Here’s the water, drink. We need towels! Do bikes go on their own nowadays? Nico! What are you doing there? Doctor Baldi! Doctor Baldi, don’t do this! Doctor Baldi, there’s a woman here who’s about to give birth! Leave me alone, go to hell! Don’t do like that, breathe like a dog. - What? - Like this, look. Are you hoping to get a puppy out? Get down, this is the end of the line. I’m done joking with you. You were Tassinelli’s lover, weren’t you? - Yes. - Why did you kill her? She had become annoying. She wanted me to leave my wife and run away with her. - And so? - She threatened me. She was going to tell everybody about our relationship. You killed her, you son of a bitch! Marshal! The baby is coming out! Make him stop! He can’t come out in the middle of a street. Come! Move! Dirty bastard! You wanted to kill Windy as well. It isn’t true, let me go! Hello? I'm Marshal Giraldi. The killer of Porta Romana is handcuffed at the sos phone on the highway, at Km 92. Over and out! My son is coming out! Marshal, don’t leave me here! Marshal! We better stop. She can’t give birth if you keep speeding like that. Be a good midwife, my son must be born in Rome. - Nico! - Angela, close your legs! Tell Rocky to wait! Grandma! Grandma! Lots of people were born this way. Move, let me do! Angela, think about something else. - What do I have to think about? - Rome winning a cup! We are in a little town called Colletera. What do you care? What are you talking about? I care. I don’t want my son to come out here. I can’t handle this! Put something in my mouth. Angela, we are 10 Km away! Angela, 9! Minus 8! Minus 7! Minus 6! Minus 5! Minus 4! Minus 3! Minus 2! Minus 1! He’s born, he’s a boy! He weights around 4 kg and a half. Cheers! Cheers for Rocky! Cheers for Rocky! - Drink. - You said Stallone would come. - But he didn’t. - He was busy with "Rocky III". He sent his secretary. We screwed him because we made Rocky IV. Tell him where he can put his finger... Don’t be vulgar. He doesn’t understand, he’s American. I’m glad to be the godfather of this nice child. Let’s make a toast. Let’s make a toast to the health of the baby Marshal! - Cheers! - Yeah! Why did you call your child Rocky Giovanni Paolo Enrico Bruno? Rocky for the actor, Stallone. Giovanni Paolo for grandma, it’s the Pope. Cheers for the Pope! - Enrico for Berlinguer, for Angela. - And Bruno? Because he’s my child and I’ll call him how the fuck I want. He looks like you. A little bit also like me. He got the upper half from me and the lower half from his dad. Will he do the same work as you? Don’t you even try! I want to quit this job. "Detective Agency Nico Giraldi and son". Right, my love? Let’s quit this job. Beautiful child of mine! - Beautiful child of mine! - How sweet! Cute! Cute! Cute!
