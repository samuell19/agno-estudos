We were... uh, we really, really wanted you, and for a long time. [chuckles] And some doctors said that we would need some help... um, to have you, and then, the week that we were gonna go in and get that help... [laughs] We found out we didn't need any. So, we'll do this again tomorrow - and the next day...[laughs] - Tomorrow? We're not doing it every day. - Anyway... - Okay, but we... we love you.

[Charlie] And I will not be doing that. - Mm. - [Charlie] You excited? - Yeah? - Yeah, are you? - [Charlie] Hell, yeah. - I'm nervous. [Charlie] Oh, come on. Well, I haven't felt anything yet, so I dunno. I just hope everything's okay. You know, like I wanna... I wish we had just little windows that you could peek in and be like, "Hey, you cool in there? Oh, good, I see you got fingernails, peace." Poo-poo... you don't have to say peace, though. [Charlie] Why did you poo-poo it? [chuckles] Poo poo, I dunno. It's sound effects. [laughs] Come on. Gimme the camera. [radio presenter] Growing increasingly angry... [Charlie] You're too close. [crosstalk drowns out speaker] [Paula] The lens cap's been off.

Oh, do you wanna know the gender? Considering where it is now, I recommend further testing, but a lot can change over the next few weeks. Just gotta keep an eye on it, okay? This one. [chuckles] [nurse] Saying you wanna know what we were just saying? That you guys have... are a cute couple. - Oh, thank you. [laughs] - [Charlie] Yay! - [Paula laughs] - Yay! - [Charlie] Thank you. - [nurse] Yeah. [Charlie] Can hardly believe we just met two weeks ago. [Paula] Oh, ha-ha. You're funny. [Nurse] Oh, he is. [Paula] Is it you come in to get your results, or is it they send them to you? [nurse] Um, when I get those results, I'll call you right away. - Okay, put pressure. - Okay. Is that when they tell you if they can tell the gender from that too? [nurse] They can tell the gender from the chromosomes. [Paula] Oh, my goodness. Okay. Although, it looked really kind of obvious. - [Nurse] Yeah? Do you think? - [Charlie] Yeah. - It looked very boy like. - [Charlie] There was a doodle. - [Paula laughs] - [nurse] You saw that? [Charlie] There was a doodle. - [nurse] Oh, wow. - [Paula chuckles] - [nurse] That's amazing. - Yeah. [laughs] [car door cracks open] [Charlie] And the doctor says it's a... [laughs] Baby. [Charlie] A baby. [laughs] Ohh... She said it's too early to tell, but she did say that it looks a lot like a boy. [laughs] Oh, gosh. - [camera beeps] - [Paula] Okay, rolling. [Charlie] I'm just texting my brother back. He's worried about something, hold on. [Paula sighs] Come on. He worries about everything. - [upbeat music] - [door clicks open] Coming to you this summer... - [door bangs] - [Paula laughs] [♪♪] The hottest summer fashions, presented by the model, Dada!

And then, for the traditional prison kid. [Paula chuckles] Charlie. Bars! Nothing says prison like bars. [Paula laughs] [Paula] I'm thinking you had a theme while you were shopping. I didn't mean to. It just happened. But when he or she gets a little older. [Paula] Mm-hmm. [Charlie clears throat] - NASA. - [Paula] Oh! [laughs] It's got little... it's got sort of a space theme. NASA, sounds cool. - [upbeat music] - [Paula chuckles] Mm, mm, mm, mm. [Paula] I love them. You can just imagine him waving and... [Paula] Or her. Or her. I think it's gonna be a boy. - [Paula clears throat loudly] - Ssh! That's what I'll do. I'll just throw him. I need to use the bathroom. [Paula] I got that on tape. You're gonna get arrested. I didn't mean throw throw. [Paula laughs] You're terrible, honey. [laughs] [camera beeps] [Charlie] Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. - [Paula] There's no holding. - [Charlie] No, no, no, no. Let me get in, let me get in. Okay, okay, okay. [Paula sighs] Tell me and the baby why you're crying. It's stupid. I know it's stupid. [Charlie] It's... listen, Paula. It's not stupid. [Paula sighs] [Charlie] It's not stupid. It's hormones. Tell us why you're so stupid. [chuckles] Charlie! [Charlie chuckling] [Paula] I hate you so much right now. [Charlie] Shut up, just... [laughs] Tell me, why are you crying? I'm crying because... [mumbles indistinctly]. [Charlie] Oh, my God. No. You're gonna have to say it again. Say it again. Why are you crying? [Paula cries softly] I don't wanna pick the wrong car seat. It's really important, and there's just too many to pick from. [Charlie] That is called a first world problem. You're laughing. Go away. - I'm so mad at you. - [Charlie laughs] I'm so mad at you. [Charlie laughing] [Charlie] We have, like, six months. Just remember... it's my first cut. I'm still learning. [Paula chuckles softly] [Paula laughs] You included this scene? [Charlie] If you did it, then I... yeah, it's fair game. [key clicks] Honey... It's so... [chuckles] It's so good. - Oh, my gosh. - [Charlie] Yeah? - You think so? - [Paula laughs] [clears throat] Well, you know... - Yeah. - [Charlie] I don't mean to brag. I'm pretty good at everything, but... - No, it looks... - [Charlie laughs] It looks like a... it looks like a movie. [Paula laughs] Now you just need, like, a bunch of action shots, and explosions, and... [Paula laughs] [Charlie] For a baby film? That's stupid. [Paula laughs] I wanna see it again. [Paula sighs] [Paula sighs] [Charlie] Care to explain yourself? I didn't know what to do with it, and I felt weird throwing it away. [Paula sighs] You can throw it away. Sorry, just... - [camera beeps] - [Charlie] Hmm. [Paula heaves] [Charlie] You okay? [Paula] Mm-hmm. [coughs] [Paula heaving] [Charlie] Hey. [Paula moans] [Charlie] Want me to hold your hair? No, thank you. [Paula spits] [sniffles] [Charlie] You okay? Yeah. [cries softly] I was supposed to go to my meeting, but I'm gonna be late. [Charlie] Huh? This is supposed to be done. It's supposed to be first trimester stuff, and this is now second trimester. It's supposed to be in the no more of this. No, no, no! [door clicks closed] [Charlie] Let's go. Chop-chop. What? This is the dress that I ordered for this book launch. [Charlie] That's lovely. You look great. Let's go. We're gonna be late. Oh. Yeah. [Charlie] Wait, you're pregnant? [chuckles] Shut up. Aww. I can't announce it this way. We're making that video for it. [Charlie] Honey, we gotta go. I dunno what to... Suck it in. [chuckles] This is me sucking it in. - [inhales softly] - [Charlie] And... I like it better that way actually. - Sucked in? - [Charlie] No, the second way. Not the sucked in way, the second way. I have other dresses. Let me try some on. [Charlie] Oh, my God, we don't have time. [Paula] Charlie! - [door clicks open] - [sighs] Okay, be honest; so is it good, or do I kind of look like a planet? [Charlie] You don't look like a planet. Come on. Let's go. I'll get your broomstick, and we can fly over there, all right? Broomstick? [door clicks closed] [Charlie] You look great, honey, let's go. Yeah, this one's best, or...? [Charlie] Baby, you look beautiful. We are gonna be late. It's your big night, come on. [whispers] Okay. You're right, okay. [chuckles] [camera beeps] Hi, baby. Tonight was a big night for your mom. Um... [ambulance siren wailing] She had a book launch party that was happening. It was, um... a big deal. - [car engines whir] - [police siren rings] As we got close to it... [police siren wails] Uh, there were a lot of police. There were a lot of people. - [crowd clammoring] - [Paula] A lot of people. [protestor] How do we get out of this mess? [crowd] Revolution! [police siren wailing] Well, we finally got a call from Irene... from your mom's publicist. The launch was canceled. It was just a party. It's not a big deal. There were just gonna be some big people there, so she's disappointed, I'm disappointed. Well, I'm gonna take a bath. [chuckles] So. [clears throat and sighs] [shoes clatter to the floor] [Charlie sighs] [shuffling] [Paula] But it's kind of a long time, Charlie. - [Charlie] Huh? - [plastic hangers clatter] [Paula] Be careful. [Paula sighs] I am so bad at this. [sighs] [Paula] Do you really have to go? Do you really have to not help me fold? [laughs] [Paula] I'm trying to make you feel guilty. [laughs] Couldn't say it with a straight face. [Paula] You're leaving your pregnant wife. I'm not leaving my pregnant wife. [Paula] Yeah, you are. I'm going to work so that my pregnant wife has a baby that... - [Paula chuckles] - Has money. [Paula] Yeah. - [Charlie laughs] - [Paula] Ugh, okay. Every year, stupid coin show. I mean, not stupid coin show... really great, amazing coin show. What's that? [Paula] What? That's the roof that that stupid coin show pays for. - [laughs] - [Paula] Shut up. - You wanna go with me? - [Domino screeches] - [Paula] What? - [Domino screeches] - Wanna come with me? - [Paula] No! She fits. [Paula] You can't bring the cat. [chuckles] I really wanna bring her. [laughs] Can you imagine? That would be so fun. [crickets stridulate] [helicopter engine whirs] That's the third one tonight. [helicopter engine whirring] [camera beeps] [chuckles] Um, hey, baby. [laughs] Oh, I can't believe your dad has me saying that. I promised him that I'd do one of these diaries while he's gone. Your dad's at a coin convention. [chuckles] Which I'm gonna take you to Comic Con so we'll see which convention you like better, hm-hm! Um... Yeah, let's see, what's going on? Uh... We went to the doctor this week, and got to see you on a monitor before your dad left, and that was neat. You're moving, which is weird that I still can't feel, but I think any day now I will be able to. But we did see something that the doctor's a little bit worried about, um, and that's just the placement of your placenta. There's a thing called placenta previa, which would have been really bad news 100 years ago. But, um, if we have to, then we will have a C-section and get you here. [chuckles] I love you, and I can't wait to see you in a couple of months. [chuckles] [camera beeps] [Paula] But my point is there's no preggo brain. [Domino purrs] Yeah, now it's just the rest of the world is going crazy. Know what your Aunt Cathy said today? [chuckles] Mm. [sighs] [Paula chuckles] Yeah, it makes me wanna attack things too. [Paula laughs] No! Don't leave! [Paula sighs] I miss Charlie. [door bangs and people shouting in the background] What was that? [shouting continues] [Paula inhales and exhales loudly] [door clicks open] [man] Check the back of the house! [men shouts indistinctly in the background] [Paula breathing shakily] [man, faintly] Come out, come out wherever you are. [Paula, whispering] Who's that? [door rattles] - [Paula gasps loudly] - [door rattling] [Paula breathing heavily] [rattling continues] [woman] Help! Let me in! [Paula breathing heavily] - [Paula] Lucy? - [Lucy] Please. - [Lucy] Paula? - [Paula] Lucy? [Lucy] Paula, they're going to take me away from my babies. - [baby cries] - [man] Freeze, on the ground! - [woman screams] - [man] On the ground, now! - On the ground! - [Lucy crying] - [Lucy] Please no! - [Paula cries softly] [Lucy] My baby! [men struggle] - [girl screams] - [man] Shut up, shut up! Got her! I got her! - [Paula cries softly] - [Lucy screams] - [baby cries] - [man] No right to be here. Shut up. Shut up! Move. [baby crying] - [man 1] I got her! - [man 2] Yeah. [baby continues crying] [Paula breathing heavily] [door clicks locked] [people mumble and chatter indistinctly] [Paula cries softly] [baby crying] [Paula sobbing] [camera beeps] [birds chattering] Hey, baby. So, last night was... Unusual. It was a hard night, but it... but that kind of thing doesn't happen very much here or really ever. [chuckles] So, I just wanted to talk to you about it and make sure that if you... you watch this, that you're not afraid, because... because everything's okay, and... and daddy's gonna be home in another day or so, and... Um... I really... I really like our neighbor. I've always liked her. She's such a nice person, so kind, but I don't know everything about her or... or lots of things. The police, or... Or the authorities, they... they know what they're doing, and they're here to protect you and me and... And everything's gonna be okay. We're lucky... we're really very, very lucky to live here and... and now, and... [sighs] Oh, there was actually a song that that reminds me of. [chuckles] Aww; there's a lullaby that my mom used to sing me, and grandma. Well, she used to sing it to... to her daughter, my mom, and... and I'll sing it to you someday. I'm not a very good singer though. So...[chuckles]... I should apologize in advance, but I'll, um... Well I'll sing it now. [chuckles] I can just edit it out, I guess, later. Uh, it goes...

[Paula laughs and mumbles indistinctly] [Charlie] Look at this! Look at this guy. [Paula] I know! I'm so big. [gasps] Mm, I missed you so much. - [kissing] - [Paula laughs] - [Charlie] I missed you. - [Paula] How was your trip? [Charlie] It was good. It was good. Look at you. - Look at you! - [Paula laughs] - Argh, argh, argh. - [Paula laughs] [Paula] Don't eat him. [chuckles] Chars, Chars, look. [laughs] Look, look, take the camera. Come here. [Charlie] What's wrong with the camera? [Paula] No, look. [Charlie] Oh, hold up the camera. - Yes. - [Charlie] Okay. It's a blanket. Uh-tft, do you remember it? [Charlie] Vaguely. It used to tie the room together. [laughs] - [Paula laughs] - [Charlie] I'm just kidding. I have no idea what I'm looking... the world's smallest picnic blanket. It's the baby blanket that my mom made. Remember, she gave it to us for our wedding present? - [Charlie] Oh! - First thing she ever sowed. [Charlie] Do you remember that, Domino? - [Paula chuckles] - [Charlie] Remember? - It's a baby blanket. - Charlie, we get to use it. [Domino meows] - [Charlie] That's great. - Mm. [Charlie] So, no picnic, or... - 'Cause picnic sounds good. - [laughs] Okay. [Charlie] You forgot your camera. [Paula] Oh, gimme the camera. [Charlie laughs] [camera beeps] [Charlie] Mm, and these are my other babies. [Paula] Okay, I'm ready. Let's go. Hey, where to today, driver? Today, we are going to the perinatologist. And we're gonna find out if we have placenta previa or not. Which if we do, um, we get to pick your birthday. So no big deal. Right? [Paula] Yeah. [Paula sighs] [car engine whirring] [car honking] [Paula] They're not gonna let you turn here. [Charlie sighs] Road closed. Damn. [Paula sighs] [Charlie] So, we spent the entire day today trying to get to the doctor's office. And then, we spent the rest of our time trying to get the insurance companies to let us see a different specialist, but they wouldn't let us see a specialist unless we had a referral. Well, how are we supposed to get a referral? We can't get there. See, the funny thing is that our doctor and the specialist, they're in the same building. I can't see the specialist unless I get the referral from the doctor. Where's the doctor? In the same building. They're in the same building. I cannot tell you how many times I said that to this person on the phone, and their manager. Can I speak to your manager? Okay, I think they're gonna help me. Nope. Nope, no help. [inhales loudly] I will figure it out. I will find a way. I will find a way. But that's a problem for tomorrow. [chuckles] I'm tired now. [birds chirping] [Charlie] Sweet. [door clicks open] - Hey. - Hi. [Charlie] What are you doing? Mm, I'm just zoning out to social media, - What do you have? - [Charlie] Nothing. [news reporter talking indistinctly] What is it, Domino? [gasps] Oh, yay! [laughs] - It's the changing pad. - [Charlie laughs] - Finally. - [Charlie] I knew you'd be excited. That took, like, three and a half weeks. [Charlie] Yeah, it did. - But we got it. - [Charlie] Yeah, we did. [chuckles] Will you help me put it up? Oh, it's really light. [Charlie] We have to do it right now? [news reporter] Forces on the ground now trying to get... - Yes. - [Charlie] Domino's gonna help. [Paula laughs] - [Charlie] All right, come on. - Help me. - [camera beeps] - [Charlie] Okay. We're rolling, and lemme just... let me find the frame here. Mm, there. Hey, you in the chair, you seem a little stressed this week. How's it going? Talk to me. [birds chirp] [Paula sighs] It's not the most comfortable thing. [Charlie] Yeah? What's it feel like? Feels like... I ate a whole Vegas buffet... [Charlie laughs] ...That kicks. [Charlie chuckles] At least my belly button isn't sticking out yet. [chuckles] It's, like, not quite out yet. [Charlie] Um, fun fact: it only pops out when the baby's fully cooked, mm-hmm. [camera beeps] [Paula] And you don't think that's a little drastic. [Cathy] It's not drastic; I'm just trying to keep my family safe. [Paula] Safe from what? [Cathy] If keeping my family safe is drastic, I'm sorry, but I don't... [Paula] Okay, safe... safe from protesters. [Cathy] It's not just protesters. There's, like, riots and mass violence. - And people getting killed. - [Paula] Okay. [Cathy] And there's fires, and there's guns. - [Paula] Guns, fires. - [Cathy] People are pissed off, and for good reason, and it's all across the country. [Paula] This is Mark talking. - No, Mark talking, what? - This is Mark talking. I know he's a bit of a conspiracy theorist... - No, oh my God. - I see what he posts online. No, Paula, no. It's not Mark talking. Well, it's not you talking usually like this. Well, he has opened my eyes to a few things, yeah, but I agree with him. I'm not ignorant anymore. Oh, my God. It sounds crazy. What are you... oh, my... Cathy, it sounds crazy. Like you know the news is edited to be kind of sensational like that. They need to sell ads to sell more news. No, no, no, no, no, no. So, you're getting worked up about this. - Yes. - I'm not just getting worked up about this. You're getting really worked up about... Okay, well, you're starting to piss me off. - [Cathy sighs] - Look. If you feel like you need to go away and be safe somewhere, okay. That's great, and I support you, and I will stay in touch with you, and I will keep you posted on everything. But you're not gonna go? No, how can we go? We have a shop to keep, we have a house. We have a baby on the way. [chuckles] Yes, exactly. You have a baby on the way. That's exactly why you need to go, right there. There's, like, a little life inside you that you need to keep safe, and I want my nephew safe. How am I supposed to keep him safe in the woods? We could go pop a kid out in the middle of the woods. It'll be safer than here! It will be safer out there than it will be here. You're sounding crazy. No, this is not crazy. Oh, my God, open your eyes! - My eyes are open. - Open your eyes! My eyes are open, and I'm really worried about you right now. - Oh, my God... - You are telling me to leave- Don't do that to me, Paula. That is not what this is about. - Okay. - Don't you see what's happening? I see that you feel really strongly about this... - Yes, yes! - But we are not going to some cabin in the woods. [Cathy sighs] We're not going anywhere. [chuckles] Just leave me your address and I'll stay in touch with... There is no address. - There is no address. - There's no address? That's exactly why you have to come with me. That's why I came here to get you. It sounds like you're going to a murder house - For crying out loud. - Oh, my God. Just leave me the GPS, or the map, or whatever, and if... if things go the way you seem to think that they're going, I will come to you. [sighs] If anything were to ever happen to you, if you stay here, it is not safe. Okay, okay. - Okay, listen. - [Cathy cries softly] No, don't do that to me. - Please... - Don't do that to me. You always do that to me. I am just telling you I love you too. - [Cathy cries softly] - And I am safe. I'm safe. Look... he's safe. You can feel him. He's kickin'. - He's safe. - [Cathy cries softly] Oh, Cathy. [Paula laughs] [Charlie] Oh, geez, careful. [Paula laughs] Okay, ready? Two, three. [both shout] [laughs] Oh, my God. This is insane. So, I got these cool masks from the city. So, we are super safe now. All right, so hey, baby. [Paula chuckles] Special day. What's my hair like? It's probably as awesome as mine is. Good. Do you wanna tell him? Um, we... think we finally decided on a name for you. Now, we know you don't know it yet. - That was a joke. - [scoffs] But, um, we hope you like it. Mm, we like it. So, do you wanna... You wanna do it on three? Okay, all right. One, two... - Lincoln. - Hippolyte. What? [laughs] I tried. I really did. - Lincoln! - [Paula chuckles] Or Link, whichever one you prefer. We're gonna let you choose. We figured that if you're named after, like, a... a great president, and a video game character, I mean, you're probably gonna be pretty awesome. And your mom finished a children's book. [Paula gasps] - I did. - Which is really cool. Well, the cool thing about us knowing your name now is I can actually dedicate it to you. I've been working on it for a while. Um, it's a new series. It's The Good Knight Series. - Is this tape? - Yeah, just for now, um, but the first book in it is called "Nighty Knight" and I wanted to dedicate it to my son. Do you wanna read it? - The book? - Yeah, just read it. - Okay. - Here. I'll zoom in. Okay, so your grandad... [chuckles] illustrated it for me, my daddy. Are you... - [Charlie] Yeah. - Okay, mm. [clears throat] Story by Paula Rhodes, illustrations by her dad, Alan Rhodes. And it'll be dedicated to you. The Land of Learn. "There are many knights "in the Land of Learn, but this story "is only about one. "Sir Wakesalot. Like most knights, "Sir Wakesalot is on a quest. "Unlike most knights, his quest is to fall asleep. "Maybe you too have been on such a quest. "Perhaps you're even on one now." - [Paula coughs] - [Charlie] Are you sick? [Paula] No, the doctor had me cough to wake him up before. I'm trying to wake him up. Will you move for me? [whispers] You see that bump coming up. [chuckles] Uh, that's his head. [sighs] Buddy. [alarm sirens wailing in the distance] [Charlie] What is that? [alarm sirens wailing intensifying] What is that? I dunno. What is it? [wailing continues] Is that that siren? [ambulance sirens bellow past] [Charlie] What is the, um... There's a... there's a flyer, there's a flyer that said we need to go somewhere. [Charlie] Well, where'd you put it? - Um... - [Charlie] Where did you put it? I gave it to you. I gave it to you! It had the address. [Charlie] You didn't give it to me. Yeah, the orange one, I gave it to you when you... [Charlie] No, I left it on the desk for you. [wailing continues] [Charlie] Did you throw it out? [explosion bangs] [car alarm bellows] [alarm sirens wailing loudly] [Paula breathing heavily] Do we... do we... do we have to go somewhere? Do we have to go... Here. Here, here. Just... just stay down. What? Call the police. Oh, no. It's not going through. [dissonant wailing continues] Did you... [explosion bangs] [debris falling] [Charlie] I don't see anything. [camera beeps] [indistinct radio chatter] So, I told Charlie that I was gonna go to the store real quick, but I wanted to see what happened last night, that sound. I can't drive any closer, but... - [woman] Sir, step away, please. - [man] That's my car. I'm gonna walk up and see if I can... [woman] Step away, please. ...If I can find out. [car engine whirs] Oh, my goodness. [people mumble in the background] [cameras click] [indistinct radio chatter] [man] Yeah, my friend lived here. I can't get a hold of her. [Paula] Oh, my God. It's just melted. [camera clicking] [man] Excuse me, Miss? [Paula] Yes, sir, hi. [Charlie] Hey. There you are. What are you doing out here? You've been gone all day. We both agreed that you wouldn't be gone for more than four hours until we get phone communication back. You leave the camera at the front door, your purse so that it can get stolen. - I'm sorry. - [Charlie] Honey, look at me. I was worried sick. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to worry you. - I... I... I got... - [Charlie sighs] I didn't go... [birds chirping] I didn't go to the store. Charlie, I went to find out what that sound was last night. It was an explosion. [Charlie] Baby, of course it was an explosion. Nothing else sounds like that, it was- No, no, not just an explosion. It was a bomb that exploded. Like, on purpose, and people were saying it was to get rid of these... these... these rebels. [Charlie] Rebels? What do you mean rebels? Yeah, well, that's... that's what I wanted to find out, and so that's where I went. I went to the library. They have internet there. I waited... I had to wait a long time, but I read so much, and news sites, and blogs, and Twitter, and Charlie, we've been so stupid. Like how did... how did we not care about this before? [Charlie] What are you talking about? I think... I think it's not safe here right now. [Charlie] At our house? Here, in the city, I think we need - To consider maybe... - [Charlie sighs] - If we should go. - [Charlie] No way. - Go? - Yeah. [Charlie] Go where? Where? - I don't know, maybe- - [Charlie] Paula. - Maybe we find Cathy. - [Charlie] Paula, look at me. This is our home. This is our home. You wanna leave our home to go to somewhere else to find Cathy. Yeah, Charlie, I think we maybe should because my mom even emailed me a couple of days ago and said she's going to try to find her. And if we... If we decide not to go, Charlie, then not... not next week, not in a couple weeks, like tomorrow, like this week, I have to know where we're gonna have this baby and how, and if I'm safe. I have to know that. I can't be in limbo anymore, okay? Okay? [airplane engine whirs] [Charlie] Okay. [male radio presenter] The city experiences its fourth continuous day of rioting, while- [female radio presenter] Invite the military to take care of things. Talk about a slippery slope. You want them to attack your fellow citizens? Not a care about what happens next. Do you know what happens next? Famine, pandemic, a generation lost and future generations scarred. There's no soda pop and internet games, in that future you're sprinting toward, let alone toilet paper. I just, it's... it must be a defect on the Y chromosome. It really must. Woman do not choose this crap. We don't! So I don't know; maybe you listen to your damn mothers! [helicopter engine whirring loudly] [crowd chants and shouts] [police sirens wailing] [crowd chatters and chants loudly] [man on speaker] You need to disperse. - Leave immediately. - [helicopter engine whirs] [crowd shouts and cheers] [all chanting] Not my president! Not my president! Not my president! Repeat- [camera beeps] [Charlie sighs] Hey, baby. Today was a rough... rough day. [clicks tongue] I, um... I lost the shop. There was a, um, a riot. Was... There still is a riot, but they took everything. Everything. [inhales loudly] Except this. 1862 three cent trime, MS65 NGC. It's from the civil war. [sniffles] [coin thuds] [Charlie sighs] [crickets stridulate in the background] I'm scared, Lincoln. I'm scared because... I thought I had everything figured out. I thought I knew. I'm not sure how to protect us. I'm not sure... that I'm going to be the father that... [door creaks] - [Paula] Hey. - Hi. [Paula] What are you doing? Just... [Paula] Hey. What's this? Just doing a... a baby diary thing. Just come to bed, okay? Tonight was hard, I know. I can't sleep. I won't be able to sleep. Okay. Just let me hold you then, okay? Just let me hold you. [sobs quietly] We'll figure it out tomorrow. All right? I'm glad you're okay, and it's just stuff, and we will figure it out, but I need you to come to bed now. [Charlie cries softly] Come on. Come on. I got my coin. [Paula chuckles] [Paula sighs] [Paula sighs] Oh, there they are. Goodbyes are hard. Let's just say till next time. Next time is in, like, two-ish months. [chuckles] Goodbye. [camera beeps] It's right where you always put it, yes. - [Charlie] Bring it here. - [Paula] Hold on, did I put it... I did, yeah, it's okay. [Charlie] Paula, bring the camera here. Make sure it's recording; bring it here please... - [Paula] It is recording. - [indistinct chatter on TV] - Come on. - [Paula] Why couldn't- - [news anchor] That the President... - Come on! - [Paula] Whoa. - Is it recording? [Paula] Charlie, stop. This is not okay. - You can't talk to me this way! - Listen, I'm sorry. [Paula] This is first thing in the morning. - Is it recording? - [Paula] Yes. Listen, give it to me. Give it to me, give it to me. - [pensive music] - [Paula] Oh, God. - [Charlie] Watch. - That's right, Jeanie. Obviously, details are still coming in, but we did confirm the president was shot shortly after arriving to town here this morning. - [Paula] What? - He was taken - to Memorial Hospital. - [Charlie] Shh. - [Paula] What? - And right now, he is in critical condition. Of course, they're still trying to determine just how severe his injuries are. There have been reports that he was shot three times. Right now, there are protesters and supporters taking to the streets downtown. Police advising everyone to stay calm. A news conference is expected to happen just before noon, and we'll bring you updates as soon as they're available. [pensive music on television] [news anchor] Thank you, Jade. The police department is urging the public to avoid downtown and to stay indoors if you're already there. We'll be back with our coverage of what now appears to be an assassination attempt on the president, including the latest reactions from the mayor and an eyewitness. [birds chirp softly] - Do you wanna... - Mm-mmm. No. Okay. Um... Lincoln, today is a very sad day cause it's one that you're gonna learn about in history class probably. Um... The president was shot and killed today, and, uh... [scoffs] By a bunch of people that were really angry about a lot of things and... uh... they just... they took it out on him. Uh... [sighs] Rather than just... [clears throat] [gun shot fires] [man] Whoo-hoo! [gun shot fires] [man 2] Yeah! What is that? [crowd chatters and shouting indistinctly] [Charlie] There's people celebrating. - What? - [Charlie] Two doors down, there's people celebrating in the street. Is that a gun? - [gun shot fires] - [man] Yeah! [Charlie] I'm gonna go out and say something. - No, no, no! - [Charlie] No, no, - This is... - Charlie, there's a gun. [Charlie] No, this is... I cannot believe that people in our own street are celebrating! Just sit down. Just please... please for me, just don't go out there. - [Charlie] Why? - They have a gun. - [Charlie] This is not a... - [camera beeps] - [Charlie] You okay? - Mm-hmm. [Charlie] Does that hurt? It's just uncomfortable. [chuckles] [Charlie] So, like I said, it's not a baby diary. - Mm-hmm. - [Charlie] It's just, like, an interview. Okay. [Charlie] And by interview, I mean, it's a baby diary. [chuckles] I'm just kidding. What are you looking forward to most? Looking forward to? [Charlie] Yeah, with our son, Lincoln Charles. A lot, but I'm mostly just kind of worried right now. [chuckles] We're... we're not even sure how we can have him... [Charlie] Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. This is not... [sighs] This is not... I don't want you to be negative, okay? I really want you to... I really want you to tell me, like, good things, please. What are you looking forward to with our son, Lincoln Charles? I am... [sighs] I am looking forward to... seeing what he looks like, and to hearing what he sounds like. [chuckles] And I want... I wanna know what makes him laugh. - [Charlie chuckles] - What he's interested in. And what his little... his little head smells like. [chuckles] And then, I want... Did we blow a fuse? [birds chirp] [Paula] Did you get her? Oh. [Domino screeches] - Ugh. - [Paula chuckles] She's so loud. [dog barks] - [Paula] What? - Whoa. [jets roaring distantly] [Paula] Oh. [plane engines whir and bang] Oh, my God! [tense music playing in the distance] [jet engines roar] [Paula] Oh, my God! [Charlie] Go, go, go, go, go! Get in the house. [alarm wailing loudly] [Charlie] All right, now go pack your stuff. - Let's go, go pack your stuff. - Okay. [tense music plays inside the house] [wailing continues] [Charlie] I got clothes! [Paula] I'm getting some food. - You have the cat carrier? - [Paula] Uh, living room. [♪♪] What? Baby, we gotta move, go. Okay, I just gotta get one thing. [bedroom explodes] [rattling] - [Charlie] Paula! - [Paula] Yeah? - [glass shatters] - [Paula yelps] [Paula] Yeah, okay. [wood creaks] - Yeah. - [Charlie] Go, go! [wood cracks loudly] [both breathing heavily] [Paula] They're still up there? They're just doing passes. [Paula cries softly] Oh, my God, okay. - Oh. - Do you have the bag? - [Paula] Yes, I got it, I got... - Do you have the batteries? The batteries are in the front. [Paula] Batteries, yes, and I got the... I got the coordinates, and the maps are in the door here. I got, uh... I got the baby blanket; that's all I got. [cries softly] That's all I got for him, Charlie. - [Charlie] Breathe, breathe. - [Paula crying] That's all I got for my baby. - Breathe. - [Paula] Okay, and I got... [cries softly] I guess I got some food for us, a little bit, but we're gonna have to get some for Dom... [Charlie inhales and exhales loudly] [Paula] Charlie? - Charlie, turn around. - What? - [Paula] Turn around right now! - What? Why? [Paula cries] We don't have Domino! - What? - [Paula] Oh, my God. [cries] Oh, my God; we left her. Charlie, turn around. She must be so scared. Please turn around right here. - Paula... - [Paula] Please, Charlie. - Sh... Paula, she... - [Paula] What? Oh, my God, watch out! Domino is gone. [Paula] What? What, no. She is in our house. [crying] We have to go get her. She's probably hiding. - She's probably... - She's gone. [Paula] She's in the closet, or she's under the bed. We have to get her. She was in the bedroom. [Paula cries] No. [cries] No, not my baby. There's nothing left, Paula. [Paula] Please! Please, we have to try. I need you to be strong. [Paula sobbing] My baby. Please, Charlie. [cries] Please, just we gotta try. [Paula cries] Please, please, turn around. [radio presenter] ...To issue the following evacuation orders. For those north of me, use Five North. All other routes out of the city- [Charlie] Hey, why don't you plug that in while we're driving? [radio presenter] For those south of Main... [car engine whirs] [buildings exploding] [camera beeps] [people chatter in the background] [Charlie] Oh, wow. [Charlie sighs] I mean... This... this can't be... - [camera beeps] - It was just empty, nothing. I've... I've never seen anything like it before. [Paula sighs] What are we gonna do? [Charlie] Well, I mean, we'll... we'll get to your sister's, and, um, I mean, we'll find a doctor, and we'll... [sighs] We'll be okay. - [Paula] We will? - [Charlie] Yeah. - [Paula scoffs] - Yeah, and if... and if we don't like living with Cathy and Mark, then, you know, we can go on to Mexico. [Paula] Let's hope they're nicer to refugees than we've been. [sighs] [Paula exhales loudly] [whispers] Every sound scares me. [Paula sighs] [Charlie] Try to sleep. [Paula] Yeah. If I wake up, this will be gone, right? [sighs] We'll get back in bed. [Paula sniffs loudly] [Charlie] So, apparently... we stopped somewhere that has seen better days. Your mom's finally sleeping, so I'm just gonna peek around here and... mm... let's see if we can find some stuff that we need. I don't think I was the first one with that idea. Hm. Damn. Whoa. [drone buzzing] [fire crackles in the distance] I should get back. - [Paula] There's... - [Charlie] Turn right or left? [Paula] Yeah, turn. Turn... turn right, and I think it takes us to a little back road into the foothills. [sighs] I dunno, I thought it was the right way. [Charlie] No, I'll just turn back and I'll go the other way, okay? - I'll just go... - [car bangs] [Paula and Charlie yelp] - [woman] Please! - [Paula] What? [Charlie] Are you o...? [Paula] Help her. [car engine whirs] [tense music plays in the car] [Charlie] Hey, that's her. [Paula] We have the first aid kit. [seatbelt clicks] [Charlie] Babe, don't go anywhere. - [Paula] Charlie. - [Charlie] Lock the door. [door clicks open] You all right? - [Halford] Uh... - Hey. What happened, man? [Halford] Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. - [Charlie] Are you hurt? - [Halford] Oh, I'm fine. She'll be fine too. Good work, Daye. [tense music] [car door clicks open] [Paula gasps loudly] Is this reality TV? You're driving down a toll road. [Charlie] Hey, hey, hey, let go. Hey! Let go. [Halford] You might just consider us the toll booth. [Paula] Hey, no let go! [Charlie] Let go, don't, do not! - [Halford] Oh. - [Paula cries softly] The toll for two is higher than the toll for one. Cheese. [man in car] Is this song for me? [laughs] [song volume increases] - [Paula] Don't! - [car hood bangs] Okay, okay. All right, all right, all right! All right, we'll go... we'll go back the way we came from. I won't say that you guys are here; you can do whatever you want. We're just gonna go back from where we came, okay? My wife is eight months pregnant. [tense music] We have nothing. Please. We're just trying to get somewhere safe. [Halford] I just want you to get somewhere safe too. But you're wrong about one thing. You got a lot. You gotta car. Well, you got each other. [tense music continues] It's the best deal you're gonna get, brother. Take what you can carry and walk on. [Paula screams] Charlie! - [Charlie] Don't touch her! - Get her outta the car. [man in car chuckles] [tense music continues] [Paula breathing heavily] [crickets stridulate] [Paula] Charlie? I can't... I can't keep up. [exhales loudly] [Charlie sighs] [Paula panting] I'm sorry. [Paula] For what? Not being... Not taking better care of you. [airplane engine whirs distantly] Look. [metal music] [car screeches] [metal music continues] [crickets stridulate] [Paula exhales loudly] Okay. [door knocks] [Paula whispers] Charlie? [Charlie] Yeah, come in. It's clear. Come in. [Paula sighs] [Charlie] You okay? [Paula sighs] I don't think I can walk much further. [Charlie] Well, we'll just hang out here tonight, and figure everything out in the morning. Here. [camera beeps] Here. Okay. [sighs] It's like a half-star hotel. [Paula chuckles] [mutters] Oh, God. Oh, I just wanna be at my sister's. You have the coordinates. - Mm-hmm. - We'll do our best. - I do, I got 'em. - Get there tomorrow. Maybe two days, I don't know. - Mm-hmm. - I dunno, it depends on what the roads are like. If we can... what? - [Paula sighs] - What? I have the coordinates, but I... The map is in the car. Oh, baby. That's fine, don't... you know what? It doesn't matter. - It doesn't, hey, we can get- - How are we gonna use it? - We can get another map. - [Paula sighs] Maps aren't hard, but you know what? [Paula scoffs, sighs] You desperately... you need to eat, here. - Ow. - What? What, are you okay? Yeah. Oh, he's kicking or something. He is moving so much. [Paula exhales loudly] Are you okay? Yeah, it just hurts, like, tight. Oh, my headache's so bad. [gun shots fire] No, it's not... it's not... it's far enough away. We're okay. [camera beeps] Hey, baby. Baby Lincoln. [exhales softly] So, yesterday, things took a turn. I guess, they kind of did a long time ago, but regardless, this is not what we planned for your beginning. I really had hoped for, you know, the perfect nursery and matching outfits... [chuckles]... and then play dates in the park. But those... Those things really aren't important; they're not. [sighs] And I may need to tell myself that for a little while, but they're not. [sighs ] But we're gonna go. We're gonna get to... [exhales] Out of here and to your Aunt Cathy's, really soon, okay? Or at least to a... to a doctor's. Your dad's out looking right now. He's looking for a map, or... or... or some food, or, you know, some way to get to... [door creaks] Char? [door creaks] [man] Hello? - [camera beeps] - [Charlie] So, yeah, um... Then we got car-jacked. There was, like, 15 guys came out of nowhere. Shortly after, we found this place, uh, we stayed here for the night, and, um, yeah, I spent this morning looking for food, or a hospital, or clinic, something, you know, for my wife. - Well, that's just awful. - Yeah. You know, it's a real tragedy that this happened to two strong Americans such as yourselves. I'm sorry. Real, real sorry. Yeah. Yeah, thank you, um... I just keep telling myself, you know, that it... that no matter how bad it is, and it's pretty bad, that, um... you know, it's gotta be worse for so many other people. [sighs] It just helps me, I dunno. I dunno, I dunno. What, um... Did you... what brought you here? What brought you here? Oh, I guess, I got myself here. I felt called. Called, you mean, like to help? Mm-hmm. To help the whole damn country. Uh, do you have a car? Did you come from far away? Yeah, pretty far. [chuckles] I guess, you're noting my lack of supplies. Yeah, I mean... I mean, we don't have much. We just grabbed whatever we could before the house... Um, but also, I was thinking, maybe tomorrow that you and I could maybe look for some more or try to find a clinic for... [man laughs] For Paula... what? Oh, this is the way it works... Whoa, hey. Now, son. I want you to give me everything you have. Now, see, that was just a little example. I don't mean any harm to you fine folks. You just need to become aware that that's the way the world works now. And I would like to, uh, help you out, except that tomorrow is my day of rest, and I think I'm just gonna take it easy. [Charlie] Okay. Okay, um... Okay. I... I... I would really love it if you could join me... Like I said, tomorrow is my day of rest. So I'm gonna take it easy. I would however, be willing to keep an eye on that little lady of yours. - [camera beeps] - [Paula] Uh, no actually. I... I didn't know that. Here. Thank you, kindly. Oh, yeah. [Paula exhales] It's been brewing for a long time. Huh. It's really a much- needed cleansing, a blessing really. A blessing. [chuckles] [car approaching] No, I can't say that it really feels like one. It will. - Hm, well, I... - [car door opens] [upbeat music playing from inside car] [man] Dee? - Hey, Dee, you in there? - [door creaks] If you in there, come out, man, we gotta go... [♪♪] [man] Oh, hey. Whoa, hey! I'm not armed, man. - [gun shot fires] - [man yelps] - [gun shot fires] - [body thuds] [♪♪] [body scraping] [Paula breathing shakily] [door creaks open] [♪♪] [door clicks closed] [Paula breathing heavily] You're welcome. You killed that boy, he... You're damn right I did. Wasn't my first, and it won't be my last. That's the kind of punk that took everything from me. One of them took my job. He complained about the use of excessive force. Excessive force after what that little shit did to that beautiful red-headed clerk. [♪♪] He's a kind of punk that caused me to get a divorce, and my wife always taking up for them, and trying to get me to see their side. They don't get a side. It's time for us to take back this country from the bastards who desecrated it, from those who mock it, and from those so-called officials who strangle our rights, which is exactly what I'm doing. And it's just a happy coincidence that this little uprising made it open season on the societal leeches, who complain about the poor treatment that my tax dollars, my dollars, pay to house and feed them. Open season... Y... you're hunting? [cries softly] People? It's a war, darling. Why do you think I come here? It's good hunting. [tense music] [sighs] Good huntin'. That's right, and I am gonna make it a better world for that little one there. Now this may be difficult for a soul as sensitive as yours to take in, but the world ain't what it used to be. It's better you learn that now. Toughen up that skin of yours. [music ends] [water splashes] [Paula panting] [Paula gasps] What the hell, girl? [Paula breathing heavily] What do you think you're doing? [chuckles] No, it is never hunting season on any group of people. So... so while you're here, while you're here eating my food, and sleeping on my baby's blanket, you do not get this gun. Now I am guessing that you do not know how to use that, so give it back before someone gets hurt. [Paula breathing heavily] I'm not asking again. [gun shots fire] [Paula struggles] [Paula] Stop! [gun shot fires] [body thuds, slides] [footsteps approaching] [Charlie] Paula? Glenn, Paula? [door creaks] Hey. Charlie... Oh, my God, Paula! Paula, honey, are you okay? Are you okay? What did he do to you? - [Paula mumbles indistinctly] - W... what happened? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Did he do something? Did he hurt you? He wanted... he wanted to... Are you... baby, baby, are you okay? - I'm okay. - Okay, okay; I got a car. - I got a car. - Can't believe you're here. I found a clinic. Let's get you out of here. - Let's get you out of here. - My water broke. What? My water broke a while ago. We're having a baby? Come on. Are you in pain? - Mm-hmm. - Come on. - Come on. - Okay. - [Charlie groans] - [Paula whimpers] - [Charlie] Stay here. - [Paula] Okay. [Paula panting] [car engine whirs] It still feels like it's on me. Ugh. [whimpers] Okay. Okay. Mm. Um... [exhales] Link. [chuckles] [Paula inhales sharply] Uh, I think that you are gonna be here really soon. [chuckles] And that is so exciting and so scary. Um... I need to tell you something. I need to tell you that you are so wanted and so loved. Oof. [breathing heavily] So loved. Please know that forever, okay? And I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I did something really, really bad. I didn't mean to do it. I just... I needed to protect you and other... other people. [cries] There had to be another way, oh my God. If anything happens, I just need you to know that I love you. [Charlie] You are not going anywhere, Paula, okay? Okay. Okay. [Charlie] I think this is it. I think this is it. [military staff] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Sir, is this is the clinic? - The clinic's at capacity. - I need... There's another hospital about 45 minutes north. No, but I need to get my wife in right now. Her water has broke. We cannot go back down that road. That road is too dangerous. You know that, sir. [man] Is there a problem, Private Wagner? Look, I can't let you pull in. [birds chirping] If you walk up the entrance on the other side, I don't think they'll turn you away. Thank you. Think I found it. I think I found it, come on. I'm sure there's an easier side... [Charlie] We're almost there. Charlie... [Charlie] We're almost there, baby, come on. - Ugh, I can't. - [Charlie] I can't take any chances. This is the way. This is the way it's gotta be. - Come on. - [gun shots fire] - [Paula and Charlie gasp] - [gun shots fire] - [Paula panting] - [Charlie] Shh, shh. I don't know if I can do this. [gasps] I don't know if I can do it. [Charlie] We can do it. Come on. We can do it. Come on. We're almost there, baby. - Hold on to me. - [Paula] Okay. [Charlie] Hold on to me. Here we go. [footsteps pattering] [Charlie] Help. [door rattles] Please, hey. She's pregnant. Hey, let us in, please? - [man] Don't open the door! - [Charlie] Let us in. Excuse me. She's pregnant. Can you let us in, please? [crowd chatters chaotically] Please... her water broke. She's in labor. [nurse] Come on, come with me. [man] Are you kidding me? [crowd chatters excitedly] [elevator beeps] [people mumble and chatter in the background] [woman] I'm next, right? [Paula moans] [Charlie] There you go, baby. [elevator beeps] [elevator beeps] [nurse] Okay, come on. [people mumble and chatter in the background] [medical equipment beeping] What's your due date, honey? [Paula] September 4th. So you're 36 weeks along? Yeah, yeah. [laughs] Oh, my gosh. The last time we were able to get to the doctor, they said I might have placenta previa. Oh, well your water broke, so there's a good chance that's not the case. [Paula sighs] Oh, this is Dr. Phillips. The patient's 30 years old, 36 weeks P1 prom. Okay, we're not exactly set up for L and D here, but I suppose, anything beats being out there. Yeah. BP? 170 over 95. Double-check that. Any headaches recently? Yeah, yeah, I've had really bad ones the last couple days. Still 170 over 95. Okay, we need the FHT's. Try to get the monitors. At least get the Doppler. Oh, and ask Dr. Freeman to assist me on this one. [Paula] Ooh, oh. [Dr. Phillips] Okay, looks like we need to start timing these contractions from the beginning of one and the beginning of the next, okay? That'd be a good role for you, Dad. [Dr. Freeman] What am I assisting on? I already have a full load. A delivery, 30-year-old premigravida, 36-weeks prom. BP is 170 over 95, headaches. I've ordered the FHT's. Possible preeclampsia. How dilated and effaced? Just gonna check on that, but somebody's moved the sterile gloves once again. Let's hope the damn generator works tonight. - [Paula moans] - [Dr. Freeman laughs] [Charlie] Oh, I'm sorry, gen... what does that mean? Is my wife okay? Is the baby okay? Sir, turn that off. [hospital machines beep] - [nurse] Excuse me, sir. - [Dr. Freeman] Soon as the OR's clear from the amputation, I need it prepped. Tell anesthesia we need her to stay late. We need a urine sample STAT with max sulfate. 20 milligrams of labetalol on standby in case that shows high proteins. Let's bring her to 104 that just opened up. [Charlie] Here, I... is she... what does that mean; what does that mean; is she gonna be all right? [Dr. Freeman] We are finding out, sir. I need you to stay calm and give us a little room. Nurse Platt will help you scrub up. You can meet us once you're prepped. - Charlie! - [Charlie] I'm here. I'll be right here, baby. [Paula] Mm, I love you. [Charlie] I love you. [hospital machines beeping] [baby crying] [beeping continues] [beeping fades] [indistinct chatter in the background] Hey, baby. [elevator beeps] Oh, Lincoln, my Lincoln. [chuckles] [sighs] I can finally say that to you in person now. One of these days, maybe I'll show you these videos that we've been shooting of you before you got here. Oh, baby, your mom and I love you so much. [indistinct chatter] [Charlie sighs] The doctors are taking care of her right now, but... she did wanna be here to introduce you to the world. It's not much of a world right now. But seeing you gives me hope. [delicate, soulful music]
