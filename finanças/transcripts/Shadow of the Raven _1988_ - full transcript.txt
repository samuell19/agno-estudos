Drift-ice! Trausti!... We're lost. There's no land in sight. Now we'll have to put our trust in the raven. If the raven can see Iceland, we're saved. The sea birds give no sign. The raven's coming back to the ship. We are lost! The raven's found Iceland. After 10 weeks at sea we're on course home. Iceland. The raven has found Iceland. Trausti! Bravo! Viva Trausti. We'll follow the raven. A whale! A whale! Grim! A whale! No foolishness now. You'll scare our catch away. What did you see? You saw... A whale! Food! Food! God has sent us a whale. Now Kross will be the richest farm in Iceland. Come! Guard the whale! I'll ride home. Holy Mother of God, let Trausti return home unhurt. A whale! A whale! -Has Trausti come back? -No, but Grim rings the bell. No one may ring the bell without my permission. I found a whale. A whale has drifted ashore on your beach. I'm guarding the whale. Trausti. Thank you, thank you so much! Eric, this shawl is fit for a queen. Anything for Isolde. Nothing is too expensive for my daughter Isolde. The great artist, Leonardo himself, arrived alive to Iceland. I found a beached whale. Not on our beach but on Kross farm beach. You think it could drift a little further? The ship!? Yes. Take it easy. Hooks... Ropes... On board ! Eric you shall burn in hell! You Thief! God will punish you! Barbarian...! Most horrible. You trample upon the poor! Even though you are a wealthy man! Eric - barbarian. Thank you. Thank you very much. The whale belongs to my master! Leave it alone! The woman owns the whale! We'll tie a rope to it and haul it away. They're stealing the whale! Eric, you may steal from the poor, but now you will have to face me and my master. This beach belongs to Kross. Egill harpooned this whale but it happened to drift ashore here. -I found this whale. -Leave here, you pervert! -These are my mother's horses. -Your mother's horses? There was no harpoon in this whale when I found it. Cut their ropes! - This is our whale! You Thieves! Trausti. You told me Iceland was peaceful. Let's kill them! Don't let Grim kill Eric, you will be blamed for it. Saint, don't look! All aboard! We'll go by land to Eric's farm Trausti, you are not a barbarian. Trausti, I know I can trust you. Lord, do not forsake me! Isolde! We are being attacked... Your father Eric guards the door! Where's my child? Sol! Try to get out!... Put out the fire! Come out, you murderer! Liar! You swine! We shall have our revenge! Let's break down the door. My mother does not want blood vengeance! He tried to kill your mother,there was no harpoon in the whale when I found it. No. This decision is mine. Arsonist murderer. I offer you to leave in peace. You cannot offer to go in peace when my house is burning. I shall fight this pervert. - He is not getting away by offering me his asshole. The Bishop will avenge me. I promised my daughter Isolde to his son. Show this pervert that you are in control. -Mama! -It's all right. Granddad! Don't die!... Don't die! Mama, don't let him die! Granddad mustn't die! I don't want him to die! Stop him! You dog! Egill rides to the Bishop, and he will not hesitate to take revenge. Mama, don't leave me! Mama, stay with me! -Water! -Here! Murderer! Murderer! Mama, mama! Murderer! Murderer! Be calm, I'm alive. Eric was killed. but his daughter Isolde is here with us. Isolde is a witch. Mama, where are we going? Mama, are you sure Bishop Hordur will find us? Isolde will cost you your life. I saved her from the fire. Isolde's mother was a slave, Eric had her burned at the stake. Eric was an evil man, and evil blood is inherited. Isolde is a witch. Witches do not leap willingly into the flames. Now Isolde will inherit everything from her father Eric. Eric promised Isolde to the Bishop's son Hjorleif. Then a great fortune would be gathered into a single hand. Isolde will be the richest woman in Iceland, and the Bishop's power greater. But her child, Sol? Isolde bore the child completely alone. She was very young. She refused to name the father. Eric tried to force her, but she was adamant. But Eric found out the father was a slave. and had his arms and legs cut off the day Sol was born. What do you want me to do? Ignore Isolde and deal directly with Bishop Hordur. You are the head of the family and you can speak for us at the Althing. The altarpiece I promised you. Painted by the artist, Leonardo. Mary Magdalene. The women who loved Jesus Christ. I thought you had studied theology. The sacred work of Christ was a single dream of love. The love of all mankind, but also the love of one woman. Leonardo, the great artist. This silken veil, I would like to bestow to you. Fair lady. I understand. You believe I killed your father. But he was killed against my will. I threw my knife into the ground as a sign of peace I am the head of my family and will stand in my own defense. I saw my father killed here in the yard when I was a child. I have studied theology in Norway for many years. I was ordained a priest. And I brought an Italian with me to paint the altarpiece for my mother. But because of a beached whale... Bishop Hordur is coming, I shall ask him to put the case to the Althing. Take my body now! You may as well since you murdered my father. Dog! You filthy dog! You think you can save your life by hiding behind Bishop Hordur! So you'll go to the Althing. Do you think I have nothing to say about it? My father was killed, I shall judge! You will not have me by force nor affection. It is my duty to kill you ! For a thousand years! If your fathers death may be avenged by killing me, then kill me! I shall kill you ! Kill you! Kill you! My son! Eric has fallen. You must avenge his death for Isolde's sake. Eric is dead and Isolde inherits all his property. And you'll be the richest and most powerful chief in Iceland. Avenge his death and she is yours. The Bishop's son, Hjorleif, and his mother, Sigrid the shrew. and in their entourage there are no angles, but rather Bishop Hordur. and all his devils. Jesus! Now Isolde is worthy of you. My mother and I are prepared to go before the Althing for judgement. Isolde and Sol are unhurt. We'll decide this matter through a duel. Defend yourself! Show what you have learned in Norway. Or did you just read books under the skirts of the Court Ladies? -Shall I kill him? -No. Is that what you want? Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Finish your work! Coward! My complaint will be decided by the Althing. Drink! My mother said: You shall drink this with the man you will love for a thousand years. You drank from this without my bid- ding, therefore I tried to kill you. I feared I'd have to love my father's murderer. But now I know who you are, Get Eric's men to avenge Eric's death. I want you as my husband, you'll be the most powerful man in the land. We'll meet again at the Althing, and if you are who I think you are, then I'll be yours for a thousand years. Now we are at the border and no longer on Trausti's land. You are Eric's men. Will you betray Isolde? The blood on Trausti's hands is barely dry. But it was Grim who killed Eric. Give me the Chief's head! We will avenge Eric's death ! My mother is building a cathedral to honor my father. The first cathedral in Iceland. Your father lies in a heathen temple and your mother builds a church ! I don't understand... Odin's temple. -A temple! -A temple! Jesus and Mary! -A raven? -The raven is Odin's bird. Even the Gods become a little dusty. Your father! He believed in the raven. He who lives by the sword... shall die by the sword. Red pigment. -Blood! -Blood? Sangvis! Sangvis! Whale meat. Whale meet. Isolde, I've vowed: if this horse wins the fight at the Althing, it's yours. Do you think I'll be content with only a horse? I also want a saddle with silver fittings and gilded bridle. You command, I obey. When you take the lid from the spring, the sauna boils. The steam heals all wounds and gives you youthful power. You ordered my father's men to go back. What do you intend to do? I shall claim everything Trausti owns. You are like no one else, I would be proud to be your mother. My mother was a witch. Hjorleif, let us test the strength of the beams and the rope. Let us test the trap, my son, and test your mother's plan to boil the enemies of God in the Devil's sweat. They are in the sauna. What? Have the women now begun to deliberate in the sauna on questions of peace and other wretched matters? You follow Christ's example and again use heathen practices. Allow all reconciliation to take place in the earth's warmth which God has given us. Amen. God bless the marriage. Tar. They use tar for burning witches. I promised your father to consecrate this cathedral with a great wedding. Your marriage to my son Hjorleif. My father was killed. He never mentioned a wedding to me. 2,4,6,8. ..14...28 Most of us are still completely heathen. Completely heathen! We are only Christian when it is necessary. Yes, I understand. Yes, yes. Jesus and Mary! That arrow found its mark. Eric's men! Don't kill me, I am only a poor simple man. He threw a knife into Edda, your mother. I'm just a simple man. And he put the harpoon in the whale. No, we can use him at the Althing. I want to know who sent them. Greetings Icelanders! The first matter we shall deal with... ...is Isolde, Eric's daughter, versus Trausti. Trausti has not arrived yet, but his stallion is here. If you can see Eric's men then Trausti is dead. I grant an adjournment until the horse combat is over. Does anyone have further comment upon this matter? Trausti, don't leave me! Jesus and Mary! Leonardo, the great artist! Viva Leonardo! I demand that all you own shall be ceded to me. Hjorleif! Let it be. He who sacrifices all can win all. Victory is ours! Here is the victor. It is yours. I and my mother, from Kross, have decided that we shall accept Isolde's demands unconditionally. From this moment on, Isolde owns all our property. We shall marry. This means the reconciliation of our families, and that peace will prevail. It will never happen. Be calm now. While we are betrothed, I shall live with Bishop Hordur and Aunt Sigrid. You tempt fate if you go home with the Bishop now. I do not wish to flee. I want us to agree and part in unity. You fetch me at the stone bridge which joins the quartered lands. I want the reconciliation to take place and be witnessed there. You have great plans. I know that you killed Eric. There was no harpoon in the whale when I found it. -Do you have a witness? -Yes. Eric, he... Eric called you a filthy pervert!? God's embrace is open to all, even to traitors. Eric was a foul turd! Now we're completely in the hands of those scoundrels. Grim says you have given Isolde everything we own. You take Isolde from Hjorleif, the Bishop's son... Then the Bishop loses both his fortune and his power. Sigrid will never agree to this... When I built a church here Sigrid began to build a cathedral... If Isolde changes her mind, we will be left without anything... Do you trust Isolde? I have sacrificed everything... to gain everything. You love her... I have experienced so much. I was taken as a slave by a heathen man. who gave me you. Despite all I have been through. I still miss him. And love him. The God who created the sun has always been my God. And he has listened to my prayers. Whether he is called Christ or Odin is of no importance. Grim is afraid. Frightened men are dangerous. Be careful. Be careful. Do you really intend to let this happen? She doesn't know what she's doing. We must forgive her and find a way out. She will do what is right. -Mama, are we eating fish tonight? -Something good. This is lava stone. Sigrid, is this a special delicacy from you? If you can swallow being married to your father's murderer. then you can swallow that too. -What do I see? -Banners on both sides. Has Trausti come? No, I can't see either the Bishop or Trausti yet. There's a black horse to the left. Six of them: Trausti, Grim, Egill... What do I see now? Light-red horses on either side of the summit. A white stallion leading. White is Isolde's color, and pink is the color of the Bishop and his men. You can't exploit our superior strength on this narrow path. You are alone on the other side if the Bishop betrays us. What is Trausti doing? He rides alone to the stone bridge, but has a slave with him. Where can I see Hjorleif? Hjorleif waits with Isolde and Sol on the cliff by the rapids. -Is Trausti riding over? -No, he waits at the bridge. It would be wise to go no further until the Bishop sends someone over who can be taken as a hostage. Is the Bishop's wife there? Sigrid crosses the bridge leading a pink stallion with a gilded saddle. A stallion? Yes, the stallion Hjorleif promised Isolde as a gift at the Althing. Then we may trust this settlement, since the Bishop's wife accepts it. She is yours. What do I see now? Trausti crosses the bridge and Isolde and Hjorleif wait. Where is the Bishop? The Bishop goes to the edge of the cliff and holds his staff high. What do I see now? Nothing. But Grim appears worried. What do I see now? Trausti leads the white horse across the bridge. Isolde and Sol are ahead. Then we may trust that this treaty holds. Who will live at the Kross now? Someone you can trust. You? Where can I serve you best? At Kross. Granddad died there. Go on! Go on! Granddad is not dead, he has just gone away to Jesus. Is Jesus dead? Jesus believed in love, therefore he had to die, so that we should have eternal life. Can Granddad come back? No, but he will always be with you. How? Jesus gives everlasting life: he who believes in love shall live forever. -Does mama believe? -Yes. -Do you? -I love your mother. Mama, he loves you. May I? By the fire of love shall the house be built for the young husband and wife. A child shall be born every year, In hope that it will bring great happiness... that the fire of conflict turns to ash. It's not the clothes men like... but what's under them. I wish that this marriage, through the mercy of God may confirm the reconciliation and friendship between our families. For this reason I offer peace to all. Even to those who have opposed me earlier. I hope that everyone here has come with good intentions toward all. both in word and action. And that the conflict in our land is now over. Let us drink and dance. Loud and clear let us sing. Round Trausti and Isolde the Fair. In a ring love burns in their eyes. And the young men rise up Under every scrap of clothing. By the fire of love shall the house be built for the young husband and wife. A child shall be born every year. So for this let us all sing. And the young swain finds the embers hot in every secret place. Trausti asks Isolde the Fair to follow him up the stair. All the young smile, I beat my drum. Into the house I go to the bridal bed. How dear it is to sleep with her wings around me. To the wedding came the Bishop's men in throngs. They were received with the warmest welcome, joy and songs. Peace now reigns; the fires of conflict to ashes go... Forgive all those who did not know. -This blanket is for the bridal pair. -I would like to say this... That my family has come to this wedding in the hope that it will bring great happiness. and that the war so rash... the fire of conflict turns to ash... This blanket I give to the bridal couple from the Bishop's family. May the fire of love constantly burn under this blanket. We haven't forgotten yet who killed Eric Silence The gift I wish to give the bridal couple was too large to carry with me I have finished painting the altarpiece at Kross. And my artistic work in Iceland is ended. I shall go abroad with a merchant when the party is over. But now I shall sing - as there is peace in the land and love blooms - Erics men. Let's surprise them. Treason! Let's warn Trausti ! Be quiet! I will show you a secret. What!? She doesn't want to fuck you!? Every party should end when joy is at its hight. Go with them to the river border, so nobody looses their way Egill, take my boat and row the guests over the fiord. Those who wish to go. Hurry! Take down the sail! The house is burning down. The fire's an accident, we come to save them. And Isolde survives. What are we waiting for? You fetch the child Sol. We shouldn't harm her. And you deserve all the property she inherits? Not Kross, you shall have that. Mama! Mama... Take the oars! Every great deed a man does is merely a dream of love... And now you have me and I have you. Can we wish more than that love seals peace upon the whole land? Fire! Fire! My baby! My baby! They've taken Sol! If they've taken Sol then they intend to kill you ! When Isolde comes out, put your swords in their scabbards. I shall look after her. You cannot go out to face certain death. Sigrid is behind this. I can defeat her. Isolde! Isolde. Hjorleif. Trausti! Isolde! Save the child! Isolde! Hjorleif! Hjorleif! Let no one escape! Murderers! Find Trausti! He burns in hell ! -Where is Trausti? -He is dead! I must see him dead! The cellar Go on! No. Go down to the cellar! If Trausti is in here he will taste our spears. Let no one come out alive! I have murdered my love. The greater the sin, the more generous forgiveness is, Hjorleif! Hjorleif! Now I own Kross, I live at Kross now. Bishop have mercy upon me! Have mercy upon me! Burn all the ships! If Trausti lives he shall not sail away from here. The dead do not sail. Now Trausti's ship is mine. You should be glad I cannot reach you with my sword. -Trausti is back. -What? He went to the church . Jesus Christ! Christ in heaven ! If Christ is so dear to you, then swear your loyalty and follow me. I swear! You will betray me only once. I didn't betray you, You sent me with them...and they forced me. They knew it was I who killed Eric. And I did kill him! He forced me too... He made me lie under his men ... He humiliated me... Forced me down into the muck. and then branded me as a sodomite! Show me then that you are loyal and assemble some men. Yes, I will follow you loyally. You gave my father strength... Now you shall help Jesus Christ. Now the whale is ours! You see a dead man... Now you shall follow him, into hell. Hjorleif... Sweet Jesus, let my mother come back. My Lord, I have built a church for you, then give me back Hjorleif, and we will be even. They murdered the Bishop! Say this after me and I shall forgive you: I promise to keep the peace... In heathen times there was a rule taken up by the followers of Christ, by which all reconciliation here at the Bishop's farm, would take place within the earth's warmth which God has given us, to be sealed in the sauna. If you wish a reconciliation that will last for all time, then you should abide by this rule. In the sauna? Watch her. The witch! Reconciliation lies in sweating. And love... just runs off you... and runs out of you. It's not hot enough in here. You stay here Hjorleif can deal with the spring. Dear God who art in heaven... Thy will be done. May Hjorleif deliver us from evil and boil the Bishop's murderers in hell. Papa! Papa! I'll come soon and play with you. Now I shall play with Hjorleif. You murdered my father... took Isolde from me... For this you'll die. Forgive me. Kiss the sword. I shall forgive you... When you are dead. The church is on fire! Ill fortune has always been connected with this church. It was no built in praise of God, but to challenge my mother. Did you have a mother too? I brought an Italian painter home with me to Iceland. I had promised my mother an altarpiece. When we were riding home, we found a grounded whale. And in the quarrel that arose over the whale, I lost my mother. Leonardo came here to paint a picture for her. What picture? Yes... What picture? It's mama! Is she with Jesus? Can I go to her? Not now but she will wait for you. When I die? Then I want to die. No... She wants you to live. You shall let the dream of love become a light in the darkness. For a thousand years...
