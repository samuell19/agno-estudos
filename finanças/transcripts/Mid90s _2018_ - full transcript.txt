Subtitles by explosiveskull Stay out of my fucking room, Stevie. What's up, fool? I haven't called that guy Todd back yet. He's fine. I'm attracted to him. Oh. He seems a bit player-ish to me, though. I always have to remember to hit pause when I start feeling something. - Orange juice. - Please... Jesus. At my 18th birthday party, I was breastfeeding you. Can you imagine having a baby right now? Ian, I, uh... I got you something. I know you don't have this one. I love me a mature woman, though. You know? Hey, you sexy ladies wanna see a trick? Mmm, mmm! Right here. Ah! Get the fuck out of the front of my store? Where's Ken? Fuck you, man. I'm not fucking scared of you guys. I fought in fucking Desert Storm, you fuck... You fucking pussies. Go back inside, man. I'm not even gonna bother. Fuck you! Let's go inside. That's probably the worst "Would you rather" I've ever heard. What about, "Would you rather suck your dad's dick, "or eat your mom out?" - What the fuck? - What? Oh, my gosh. What kind of conversation is this, bro? - Fuckshit. - What's up? Would you rather suck your dad's dick or eat your mom out? You would suck your dad's dick, right? That's not a weird answer. Shut the fuck up, Fourth Grade. - Shut the fuck up. - Life or death. Come on. Hey, whatever I'm doing, I'm drugging one of them motherfuckers. I'm not gonna say who, but I'm gonna drug the motherfuckers till they sleep. You're gonna rape your parents? - Huh? - That's like... That's rape. I'd rather rape one of my parents than to consciously... Yo, what the fuck? I'm not tripping. Life or death. Life or death. Fuck it, I'd just rape my parents. Or one of them. Hey, for real, I'm never coming back here again. Wow. Y'all nigga's are scaring off customers. This is not an accurate representation of what we usually talk about. Y'all are bad for business, my nigga. Is there any way you could just, like, forget I even asked? - I feel really weird now. - Oh, hell no. Yo, these niggas are in Paris. Eating nice dinners. Staying at nice hotels. I've been to France before. Those niggas are assholes. Yeah, but you went with your parents, like... Imagine if that was us. How much cash you got? I don't have any. I'll trade you for your Discman. Well, it's just that I use my Discman all the time. Mom gave it to me for my birthday and Christmas... Wait, wait, wait! I'll give you anything in this room. I'll give you anything in this room. Just not the Discman, please. You don't even fucking know about music, anyway. It's Saturday. Blockbuster night. What do you wanna watch? Sorry. I'm gonna skate. Fuck! I'm skating like shit today, man. Looks cool to me. - I'm Ruben. - Stevie. I need some water. Damn, did you really drink all of it? Fill that up, man. Yo, Stevie, go fill up this up, yo. Yeah. Thanks, little man. Whoo! Refreshing! Shit, this is relaxing. You smoke? Yeah, these ones are just a different brand. Thank you. - What're you, gay? - What? Why the fuck are you thanking me? Don't fucking thank people, man. That's faggot as fuck, yo. Oh, sorry. I didn't know that. It's fine. Now you know. Just... Don't thank people. They're gonna think you're gay. Oh. I won't do it again. Yeah, you're gonna fucking pay attention to me, man. I'm a fucking badass. You're a little ass kid. You should fucking look up to me. I smoke. I skate. I fuck bitches. - Dang. - I'm pretty much the shit. I'm living the life. All you have is a fucking dinosaur board. That shit is '80s as fuck. It's got, like, a neon dinosaur on it screaming "cowabunga." You look retarded. You gotta get a new fucking board, man. - How much are they? - I don't know. Probably like $120 for a complete. I'll sell you my used setup for $40. It's a good-ass deal for you. Wait. Don't you need your board? I'm saving up to buy a new Motor board. Well, thanks for selling... See, I was about to say "thank you," but I know how gay that is. Don't say that shit either. Just say nothing. Fuck. Sorry. You're such a fucking little kid. Fuck, man. What time is it? I don't know, probably like 8:00? Oh, man. I gotta go, man. Um, you don't have to be home at a certain time? Nah. I always go home after my mom is asleep. - See you tomorrow? - Yeah. With 40 bucks? - Maybe. - It's a fucking good deal! All right, I gotta go. But I will. All right, you better have $40 tomorrow. Fucking idiot. I'm so sorry I'm late. It won't ever happen again. It's only 7:30. Oh. Okay. Don't be a pussy. It doesn't feel right. You came to me. You needed 40 bucks. That's a lot of fucking money. Grab $40 for you and $40 for me. All right, you're acting like a little fuck. Fine, fine, fine, fine! I'll do it. Sick. I'm gonna set this shit up. All right, I got one. I don't understand this shit. Why do they say Mexicans are lazy and shit? Why the fuck are you looking at me? Do people say that shit? I heard the shit. It don't make sense to me. Every time I see a Mexican, them niggas are fucking building buildings and shit. That's fucked up, yo. I said, "People say it," not "I say it." The whole point of this game is so you don't get offended. I do have a question for Fourth Grade. Why are white people just in love with their pets? Like, why do they care so... I don't get it. - For real! - For real! So, I'm at this white girl's house, right, and we chilling. I can hear her mom downstairs, like, "Oh my God, Eric didn't eat his kibble today. "I don't know I think we need to take him to the doctor." So I asked, "Why is your mom feeding "your little brother kibble?" Like, of course he's probably going to get sick. She go and turn around and tell me, "Eric is a dog, silly!" Dogs don't have feelings, you dumb bitch! I don't even have a dog. I have a gecko. Did... Did he just say he had a gecko? - You got a gecko? - Yeah. I don't know one nigger in the world with a fucking gecko. All right, I have one. - Can black people... - Oh, be careful. Okay, well... Is it cool to be black? What the fuck? Nigga, that's where I get all my looks from, nigga. Silky-ass sexy hair. Black don't crack. That's why I'm 17 and look 12, nigga. What, you 17 and look like fucking Mr. Burns. I guess sometimes. Like, say we go skating in Beverly Hills. Everybody is already looking at us like, "Hey, you guys are vandalizing property." Like, "Get the fuck out of here." Blah, blah, blah. But sometimes I feel like it's a... A little bit extra heavy on me. - Yeah. - People judging me and stuff, but, fuck it. Those people are ignorant. I got another one. Can black people get sunburnt? Oh, my God. Are you fucking kidding me right now? Seriously, I genuinely want to know. Like, every time it's hot out, I'm, like, "Does he need sunscreen? "Is there, like, black suntan lotion, or..." You're a real dumbass. Just when I thought you had a brain, bro. You dumb as hell. What about you, little man? Did you know that black people could get sunburnt? What are... What are black people? Fuck. Shit. That was dope. That was dope. I liked that. I liked that. Yeah, but... Y'all trying to go try skate? - Let's go! - I'm down. Ruben, you trying to skate? Yeah. All right, then let's go. You coming, Sunburn? Sunburn! All right, come on then. Sunburn! What the fuck was that? I don't know. Come on. Toss your board over. Today, motherfucker. What the fuck? Fuck! Shit! Sunburn can take a fucking slam. So, you're Sunburn now? How come some people have nicknames and some don't? I don't know. Ray doesn't. He's the coolest. I think it's better not to have one. Yeah. Ray is awesome and he doesn't have one. That's, like, way cooler for sure. You seen that? Why is his name Fuckshit? Because any time he sees a dope trick, he yells out, "Fuck! Shit! That was dope!" Fuck! Shit! That was dope! Yeah, Ray is awesome. He skates just like in the videos. Yeah, he's fucking insane. Ever since I've met him, he's gone from, like, dope to, like, next-level dope. Like, pro dope! Him and Fuckshit have pretty much the same tricks but Ray just has the sickest style ever. Yeah. Why is his nickname Fourth Grade? Because he's as smart as a fourth grader. Can I call him that? I wouldn't call anyone anything yet. Do you know where the bathroom is? Yeah. Fuck! Shit! - Hey. Hey. - Sugar babes are for fags. Hey. Y'all not supposed to be around here. Get the fuck out. - Hey, come here. - Shut up! - Don't throw rocks at me. - Fuck you! Little man, get the fuck off the property, all right? - Bitch! - Hey, come here. Sunburn. Sunburn, what are you doing? Don't get fucked up like the rest of these little niggas. Come here. Don't let them get you fucked up. Come here. You're not even a real cop! Sunburn! Stevie! This nigga's a rent-a-cop! - Hey, no. Come here! - Same to you, rent-a-cop! Fuck you, nigga. I make more than all of you. Nigga, fuck you! The fuck you doing skating with these white boys? Nigga's don't skate. Your surf's up, motherfucker. That's who you think you are? Hey, little nigga with the Toys "R" Us badge, come here. You can't say nigga, I don't think, you fucking Sheryl Crow looking motherfucker. I don't know who that is, but bitch, fuck you! You look Samoan, motherfucker. You a Samoan-ass nigga! All right, that was funny. That was pretty funny. That was funny. - Get the fuck out of here. - Fuck you! What the fuck is wrong with you? Don't... You know that's a fucking felony, right, ese? You a rent-a-cop! You'll be in fucking prison with your uncle. Yo, then hop the fence then, bitch! - You hop the fence. - Oh, all right. You hop the fence, motherfucker. I'll hop the fence right now. Whup your ass. Yeah, beat that nigga's ass! Stay right there, little nigga! I'm gonna hop the fence. Where you going? Now I'm in your face. Hop the fence. - Fuck you, nigga. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. - You need Jesus. No, you need Jesus. You're smoking cigarettes on school property. The Bible is pro-cigarettes, nigga. Jesus smoked cigarettes. Oh, yeah? What kind of cigarettes did he smoke? Jesus smoked... Jesus smoke Kools, nigger. This is awesome. I've never been in a car without someone's mom or dad before! Man... Stevie, keep that shit to yourself, man. Fuck! Sorry. - Are we allowed to skate here? - Fuck no. It's super illegal. It's a fucking courthouse. If you hear anyone yell out "5-0" just fucking take off! You see those fucking bums? If one of them offers you something to smoke, don't smoke it. It's probably fucking crack. Whoa! Those are pros! I saw those guys in Big Brother! Yeah, they ride for Chocolate. So fucking sick. And they, like, skate here? Where you guys skate? Yeah. Yo, everyone skates here. That's sick! Yo, what up. Thanks, Sunburn. You got an extra smoke? You got a quarter? You got an extra quarter? Aw, man. Come on. I was just playing. Come sit down. - I got a whole pack. - All right. - Thanks, man. - You bet. How you doing? What's good in your life? Um, I'm here, shit. I'm trying to get up off the streets, man. Before the streets get me. But, see, I look like this, so... Ain't nobody want to fuck with you. Yeah, you feel me. My "friends" or whatever, they kind of just... - Ain't no judging over here. - Oh, okay. So, let me ask you a question, man. What... What's you all doin' with the skating? I just have fun skating. It's, like It makes me happy and smile. - So, I just skate every day. - Oh, okay, fucking dig it. Yeah, it's fun as hell. But I'm trying to make a way. Oh, okay. You can do that with skating? - Yeah, if you... If you focus. - Oh, damn. There's pros. I want to be one of them. That seems crazy to me that you could get a job skating. Hell, yeah. I'm thinking, man, maybe I should have started skating. What was your last job? Man, I was in a data entry, you know. Everything kind of takes some kind of artistic mind to do. Or creative mind to do. You can't just be a robot, you know what I'm saying? You got to be able to come up with ideas. So, I'm starting to feel more like that. But I still got the old programming in me I guess from school. I'm thinking about a lot of stuff out here. You understand why we ride a piece of wood. Why we push on just a piece of wood, like, what that does to somebody's spirit. You know? Just try to keep a positive attitude. Even though it's hard as hell. But I'm glad that you all sat down with me and talked with me for a minute, man. That... That helps, actually, a lot. - You're a good dude, man. - Right on, man. Hey! 5-0! 5-0! - Later, guys. - Later. - Bye. - Cheers. You don't listen to anything I say. Stevie, can you get out here, honey? There he is. Fucking ask him yourself. Stevie, there's $80 missing from my room. I know Ian did it. He's saying you did it with him. Did you? No. Okay. Yes! Yes! Oh, my God! I did it! I did it! I did it! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Two weeks, nigga? What the fuck? I know. My parents seen my report card, they were fucking pissed. No car for two weeks. They might as well cut my dick off. My parents are fucking retarded. I'm a junior in high school, it's not like all of the sudden I'm about to get into Harvard or some shit. Like, my parents did that. They get paid. I get C's and I'm cool with that. That life's just not mine. So, what you gonna do, then? Skate. Have fun. Go to parties. Just live life. That sounds nice. All that trying hard shit. That shit's just corny. I think that shit's corny. I'm trying to get out the hood. I'm trying to go see shit. I don't live in the hood. I got options, nigga. Nigga, what options you got? I'm just not trying to take this shit seriously. Well, good luck with that. I'm gonna send you a postcard when I'm on tour. What about you, Fourth Grade? What you want to do? I don't know. Guess, like, make a movie or something. This nigga thinks he's Spielberg or some shit! You know you gotta say words to make movies. Nigga, I ain't heard you talk, like, twice. - Stupid idea. - Yes, it was. I don't know, I guess I'll just work at the DMV with my dad. Where you going? I'm about to go skate this gap. Try hard. Be corny. Right? Yeah, right. That was sick! Hit it, Fuckshit. Fuck! All right, you got it, Ruben. Yeah. Oh, come on. What kind of pussy shit was that? You got this, man. Shut the fuck up, faggot. Wait! Hey, yo, wait, wait. Wait! Wait! You're not going fast enough. Yo, wait, hey... Oh, my fucking God. Fuck! Shit! This nigga dead! Is he fucking dead, yo? - Sunburn! - Nigga, don't poke him! Sunburn, you okay? Sunburn, you good? Stevie? Damn... - You okay? - Hell, yeah. - Fuck! Shit! - Oh, fuck. - Oh, shit... - What the fuck? Hey, take your shirt off. You bleeding. - Here, lift your arms. - Yeah, help him. Here, hold it. Hold it right here. Fuck. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. You crazy as fuck! - Hell, yeah, nigga. - What the fuck? Fucking crazy! Yo, Sunburn is fucking insane! Fuck you, fool. For real, nigga. - What the fuck... - Thanks. - Dude just fell off a roof. - Sunburn! Oh, shit. You bleeding through that one. Take your shirt off! Fuck no. It's my favorite shirt. Nigga, take the fucking shirt off! You crazy, nigga. Here, take that one off. Take that one off. Here, put this one on. Nigga, take that shit off. Here, hold that. Fuck. Sunburn! We used to talk all the time. Now you just hang out with these people I don't even know. I mean, who are these kids you're hanging out with? Are they... Are they older? Are they... - From nice families? - They're my friends. - I mean, who are they? - They're my friends! Fuck! Shit! Look at this crazy-ass nigga right here. - How's your head, psycho? - It's fine. No, Sunburn. It's definitely not fine. There's some fucked-up shit going on up there. Yeah, that board's looking pretty fucked up. Yeah. I think you should probably ride one of these. Oh, I don't have any money. No, you don't understand. Like, this is yours. No one will be missing it. Are you fucking serious? Fucking serious? Hey, come back with some Skittles. Am I... Am I allowed to say thank you? What? I mean, I want to, but I don't want you to think I'm gay. Fucking weirdo. Saying "thank you" isn't gay. It's just common manners. - Oh. - The fuck? Thank you so much. No problem. Come on, now. You ain't got no trick. - Ow! Fuck! What the fuck? - Oh, fuck. My bad. - What's up, nigga? - Oh, shit. - What the fuck? - You good? What's up, nigga? What you trying to do, nigga? You still standing here! I think he might have shit himself. You just gonna stand here, you pussy-ass nigga? Hey, white boy, you gonna let this blonde bitch talk to you like that? You not gonna say shit? What you gonna do? Your friends are fags. I would have fucked that kid up. I was just solo. You think you're pretty cool with your ghetto-ass friends? You think you're tough and shit? So you fucking smoke now? Huh? Don't worry about it. You know, Mom used to smoke, right? She did a lot of stuff like that before you were around. She was a lot different when I was a little kid than when you were a little kid. What do you mean? She was very different. Guys like that coming in and out all the time. A lot of sounds. What kind of sounds? Fucking sounds. Fuck Mom. My mom and dad are fucking faggots. Shit. Can't wait until I can get a car. And my shit for sure not getting taken away like I'm a little bitch. I'm about to fuck all these bitches. Man, shut the fuck up. You ain't fucking nothing. Honestly, I'll be surprised if any of y'all niggas get pussy tonight. Hey, put y'all hands out. Ruben. Hey, why you giving that shit to these little niggas? Hey, they big boys. They can do what they want. Yeah, I guess you're right. Let me see one. Dumbass. What is this? Is it dangerous? My mom took me to a psychiatrist. The nigga said I had ADD after an hour. He gave me these. Is it, like, bad for you? If a fucking doctor gave it to you, can it possibly be bad for you? What's up, baby? Hey! Hey, Sunburn. Sunburn! Sunburn! That's yours. - You want one, Ray? - I'm solid. - You ain't getting one. - You trippin'. Why are you always filming stuff on that camera? Because one day I want to make movies. I've got this one idea. It's about this baby. Like a... Like a super baby. It's called Strong Baby. - Nice. That's cool. - He has a little cape. That's a sick idea. Thanks. Can I hit that? How long have you been friends with Ray and those guys? A couple months. It's cool. Fuckshit and Ray are my best friends for sure. They're really cool. Fourth Grade's cool, doesn't talk that much. He's just, like, films. That's cool. Ruben and I used to be homies, but he hates me now I think. Why? Uh... I don't know. I think maybe because Fuckshit and Ray like me more now. But Fuckshit and Ray are, like, really cool. They're really fucking cool. But I don't think they think that I'm that cool. You're so cute. Angela likes Fuckshit a lot. A lot of my friends do. Do you think he would really date Angela or just, like, hook up with her and then not talk to her for a month until he wants to, like, hook up again? I don't know. He does that to a lot of girls. So, you're like nicer than those guys. You're like naturally nice not, like, fake nice. Thanks. You're nice, too. You're, like, at that age before guys become dicks. Those guys are fucking retarded. Have you ever gone out with a girl? Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah. When? - Last year. - Last year? In Florida. Oh. Was it... How was it? It was all right. She worked at Disney World. She... She just got too comfortable. Didn't stand in her own lane. - What did you do? - I don't kiss and tell. I'm a gentleman. - That's good to know. - Mmm-hmm. Not like these fools. Yeah. Let's go check out Angela's room. Ooh. There you go. Take my clothes off. Are you nervous? It's okay, don't be nervous. You okay? Sorry, I'm just nervous. It's okay. Don't be nervous. Yo, Sunburn! You gotta tell us what the fuck happened in there! What the fuck happened in there? Yeah, spill it. She put two of my fingers in her vagina. And it's so much lower than I thought. What else happened? She was, like, touching my dick. - Little man growing up. - She touch your baby meat? It was crazy! I want that to happen more. Oh, shit. Wouldn't we all? Was he nervous? Hell, yeah, he was nervous. - He was shaking and shit. - Just give us all the details. Okay, okay, okay. He's going to worship you for the rest of his fucking life. He'll never forget you, actually. Estee, you're a freak. No, look, I heard Fuckshit, like... Someone was like, "Yo, Fuckshit fucks like shit." Yeah, I bet. I bet. For real though, I want his hair. - Me, too. - Same. His hair is so bomb. Estee is banging! I'm proud of this little nigga. There he is, bro. You really did that. Yeah. You a hoe, you a hoe. Yo, Stevie what the fuck are you doing? You're fucking up! Stevie! What the fuck are you doing? Talk to me. What the fuck are you doing? You're a pathetic lonely faggot. What the fuck did you just say to me? You have no fucking friends. You get no fucking pussy. I'm not fucking taking your shit. Get the fuck off me! I'm fucking over this shit! Mom! Stop! Please! Mom, please! Please! We're going in! Stop! Stop! Mom, please! Mom! Stop! Go! I was skating all day... Hey! What is your name? What the fuck? What is your name? Fuckshit. Fuckshit? Jesus... Listen to me. You do not give my son alcohol. - Ma'am, ma'am... - Bitch. - Ma'am, ma'am... - You do not give my son drugs. - Do you understand me? - Cool. Cool. Cool. It better be cool Fuckhead, or whatever the fuck your name is. Stay away from my son. He's not like you. Is she mad about the fingering? What fingering? Say goodbye, Stevie. This is the last time you're coming here. Hey, but, baby, what's your number though? - That's Stevie's mom. - You not taking that down? You not taking that down? They look like fucking gang members! What you just did to me back there... - Who are these kids? - I can't fucking trust you! - Oh. Can't trust me? - I don't fucking love you! - Shut the fuck up! - Oh, my God. Hey, shut up! Shut the fuck up! - Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! - Listen, I just want to... I just want to know where you are. - Okay? Listen to me! - Shut the fuck up! Why are you still talking to me? Quiet! Be quiet! I just want to know where... Just let me drop you off. I just want to know where you are. No! No! Yo. You all right? You don't look all right. Your mom is, uh... Very serious. I just... I just can't take this shit sometimes. What kind of shit? Just shit. A lot of the time, we feel like our lives are the worst. But... I think if you looked at anybody else's closet, you wouldn't trade your shit for their shit. Like, look at Fourth Grade. He is... One of the poorest people I know. And I'm not even making a joke though, like, he could barely afford socks. Seriously. Socks. Ruben's mom gets all fucked up. She just beats on him and his sister. Why do you think he never wants to go home? Fuckshit's like my best friend. And, like, we used to have all these sleepovers and fucking just dream about... Skating and where we want to take it. And... I just feel like he's kind of, like... Losing it a little or something. Now every day he's just trying to figure out where to party, where to get fucked up, drunk. It's sad. About, like, three years ago, my little brother was on the way to soccer practice, He was crossing the street... And he got hit by a car. It's so weird, like... We shared a room. Like, a closet. Whenever I, like, get dressed in the morning, it's just, like... Just looking at all the clothes, and they just blend into each other. It's just weird. But after he passed away, Fuckshit came to my house and dragged me out to go skate with him. It felt good to have somebody there. So, let's go. Come on. - What's up, Fuckshit? - What's up? Hey, Sunburn, let me see that. Hey, you good. Oh, shit. What's up? We was down in Florida on a skate trip. Have you ever gone anywhere like that before? Ah, no man. Where is the craziest place y'all been on tour? - Tampa City. - Is that out somewhere like Spain or France or something. How do you... How do you all find... This is fucking crazy. Oh, shit. What's up, Fuckshit? You good? What the fuck? Holy shit! - Hey - Hey. Go chill somewhere else, bro? Just for a little bit. Okay. I'm really sorry about my friend. He's cool, but when he gets drunk, he's a fucking idiot. Don't even trip. Fuck it. Dude, he touched my hair, though. Yeah, that was weird as fuck. I'm... I'm really sorry, like, um... But, yeah, like, we just... We really like talking shit to... Fuck... Fuck, um... I'm... I'm really sorry, like... I'm... Fuck it, it's all good. I'm kind of, like, tripping right now. Think I should go introduce myself? No. This is our filmer, Tim, right here. Hey, man. Nice to meet you. Tim's the man. He's goes for it. When we were out there... He's still the man. We gotta go. We gotta go back to somewhere like that. Florida was so tight. - Watch out - What's your problem, man? You're my fucking problem. What the fuck is your problem, man? - You're my fucking problem! - Don't fucking touch me! What the fuck you going to do, faggot? Don't fucking touch me! Don't fucking touch me! Don't fucking touch me! What the fuck are you gonna do? Come on. You good? Hey, those bitches wanna have a party at they parent's place. Let's roll, nigga. Let's roll. In the car. Let's just get in. Hey, Stevie, ride shotgun. See what it look, G. Why you go pussy like me, nigga? Yo, Fuckshit. Just take everybody home. No, we're going to this fucking party. Just fucking chill. Fuck that shit. Let's just call it. Everybody in here is bummed. I'm not about to let you fuck up my fun, nigga. You don't have any type of fun no more. Nobody in this fucking car is having fun, if you haven't noticed. Only fun you have is sucking them pro's dicks. Stop trying to kill my fun. You used to be fun as hell. I heard some fighting, shit. Could you, like, pull over, maybe... Why the fuck did we get in the car with you? Help! Is this fucking blood? What the fuck? - Sunburn's fucked up. - Stevie! Come on, wake up, Stevie. Stevie! Stevie! Fuck! Help! Stevie! - Sunburn! - Stevie! Why did we get in the car... What the fuck did you do? Help! Sunburn! Yeah. Do you want to go see him? Can I see it? They took a picture. Fuck! Shit! Nigga, what the fuck? That's fucked up. Are you okay? You literally take the hardest hits out of anybody I've ever seen in my life. You know you don't have to do that, right? You guys wanna see something? 5-0! 5-0! Ow! I hurt my knee! Motherfucker. - Fourth Grade? - Fourth Grade, yeah. Fourth Grade, dawg. Subtitles by explosiveskull
