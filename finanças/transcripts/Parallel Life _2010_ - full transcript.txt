"Murder" Kurt Godel, born 1906 in Austria publishes "Incompleteness Theorem" in 1931 causing a sensation in the mathematical community He was a good friend of Albert Einstein's And, you're saying that you're living the same life of this Godel? He suffered from obsessive fear of being poisoned and only ate the food prepared by his wife and, eventually starved himself to death Is that why you refuse to eat? To be like him? This book you wrote, "Parallel Theory"... Do you think the idea of "Parallel Life" makes any sense? It's just coincidence! "Elected to Congress in 1946" "Elected to Congress in 1846" "Elected President in 1960" "Elected President in 1860" "Kennedy's Vice President, Johnson" "Lincoln's Vice President, Johnson" "Both Presidentsâ€™ names have 7 letters" Parallel Life Pursuant to the ruling of the trial court, there was no evidence of the alleged victim being alive since disappearing 2 years ago The defendant openly displayed strong hatred towards the alleged victim and, there was compelling circumstantial evidence linking the defendant to the crime However, without the alleged victim's body, we cannot conclude that she is in fact, dead Because even with 90% probability if there still remains 10% doubt, the court cannot uphold a murder conviction I hereby announce the court's ruling We find the defendant, Kim Doo-jong, not guilty What kind of justice is that? What about my poor daughter?! Where is the justice for my daughter? Where is the justice for my daughter? - Good job - Thanks! Read through the Sohn case file and brief me on the main points Yes, sir About the murder case... If it's 90% probable, doesn't that mean that he's the killer? What you need for a judgment is 100% certainty of objective facts Not a likelihood or subjective certainty The press will go wild about the ruling What about Yoon-kyung? She's already here waiting for you Next, we would like to present the presiding Judge of 2nd division, Mr. Kim Seok-hyun As of January 5, 2009, Kim, Seok-hyun is appointed as the presiding Judge of Seoul High Court Lee Cheol-hee, Chief Justice of Seoul High Court There were certain skepticisms about the timing and his relatively young age and years of experience but the reason why the judiciary chose Kim Seok-hyun was a demonstration of strong will to reform the judiciary to re-establish the respect and authority of the court Whether it's lodged by the DA or the defense attorney, he dismissed every single one of their appeals I thought this one had some guts And isn't that what we all would love to do? Here, here I thought he could be a big fish with me watching his back I figured that out quickly and made him my son-in-law I had the Professor Sohn case summarized Good job - Why did you come alone? - Pardon? You said you had a blind date Didn't you bring her with you? Did you have a blind date? Kids, be careful! Stop running around! Ye-jin! Let's get you changed - Ye-jin! - I'll take her Ye-jin? Ye-jin! You must be so pleased Appointed as the youngest presiding Judge, a beautiful wife... It's a picture perfect Who are you? I'm the reporter assigned to the Sohn murder case I was curious to find out about the judge assigned to this high-profile case I see... Did you know... that you're currently the youngest presiding Judge but not the first? Excuse me? Judge Han Sang-jun He was appointed as a presiding Judge at your age on precisely the same day 30 years ago Really? He must have been as impetuous as I am Isn't that the prosecutor in charge of the Sohn case? He's been staring at your wife... Prosecutor Lee Kang-sung? You two were in the same class at Seoul National University... That's right... - Judge Kim Seok-hyun? - Speaking Congratulations, sir The appointment ceremony was today, wasn't it? - Yes. Thank you. - What a life! Who is this? For some, everyday is a living hell whiles some get a major promotion and celebrate the night away What a perfect little world! Your daughter looks adorable Ye-jin! Ye-jin! Didn't I tell you not to touch daddy's stuff? You think you can get away with a smile? Come here Wait I've been hearing things about you Daddy! I don't know who said what about me... You know what you've been up to! We'll talk about it later Your honor, I thought you won't be working so much now that you're promoted - What about Ye-jin? - She's in bed Your father didn't seem very happy when he left - What was it? - It was nothing. I've never seen him so steamed up Maybe after your mother passed away... Please look at me when we talk I gotta finish this today Maybe I'll let you if you be a good boy You were great today Thanks, honey! You must be tired Get some rest You're no fun at all Hurry up and come to bed I won't be too long This book you wrote, "Parallel Theory"... do you actually believe it's possible? It's just coincidence! What are you doing? Sit down! Get back to your seat! A coincidence is mathematically impossible What are you doing? But, he and I have the same fate - You won't die. - Quiet Godel never killed anyone Because our lives are exactly the same! "Parallel theory" "Parallel lives of Lincoln and Kennedy" Born with the same fate. Two people living in parallel "Lincoln was elected President in 1860" "Kennedy was elected President in 1960" "Lincoln's Assassin: JW Booths, born in 1839" "Kennedy's Assassin: LH Oswald, born in 1939" "assassinated by a firearm" But, he killed his wife he should be taken into custody for the sake of public sentiment Who's the prosecutor in charge? - Lee Kang-seong. - Lee Kang-seong... Are you all right? Kids these days... It would be bad politics to go against the prosecution office - I'll always remember that - Sure It's great up here This is Mt. Acha... No, actually... it's Mt. Yongma Mt. Acha is the one over there They were all called Mt. Acha back in the days I don't understand why they tore them up with different names Congratulations, your honor... It's your first case as the presiding Judge I can't do this without your cooperation We'll get warrant for Sohn, right? Shouldn't you do a psychiatric evaluation first? It's all but a scam! He's pretending to be insane after killing his wife Don't put too much emphasis on the arrest The principle of investigation is non-detainment What is this? You asked me to get some sandwiches Did I? I must be losing my mind with everything going on... - Would you like a drink? - Thanks! What do you think about that book? The "Parallel theory"? I thought it was load of bull at first but, the Lincoln-Kennedy coincidences are hard to dismiss as pure chance The year they got elected to congress and to Presidency, even the place they were assassinated are freaky matches Still, nothing but coincidence Only too uncanny! A history repeating itself... That would make life no fun Fate is what I make of it "Judiciary needs to restore public trust" There's still more left? Dad tells me to take more care He says "more stress with bigger responsibilities" Here Drink up It'll get cold Oh, well... - Hello? - Hello, Judge Kim Who is this? What don't you have a guess with that bright head of yours? What do you want from me? What do I want? I want to have your family shredded into pieces into tiny little pieces, you son of a bitch! Open the door! It was a climber who discovered the body Looks like the body was moved after the murder There was no splatter of blood We'll find out more after an autopsy No autopsy! I can't let them cut her up into pieces! No autopsy! But, in order to confirm the C.O. D... There won't be an autopsy Daddy! Daddy! Wake up! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Wake up! Mommy! Don't cry, honey Uncle Jung, daddy hates me That's not true Daddy loves you so much Are you hungry? Let's get you something to eat Well... We may have to put out a public search for the suspect I know it's a big favor but try to avoid going public I have much to owe you already but, I always wanted to have a prosecutor in the family My family wasn't good enough for you That's not true, sir My daughter... Yes, sir Never mind What do you think you're doing? The body found in Yongma... It was your wife, wasn't it? Why did you decide against public search for the suspect? Is mommy dead? How could you? I'm sorry Daddy! Your honor! Judge Han's wife was murdered, too 30 years ago On the same day What a catch! Good job, partner! Look at these pictures What are you doing? Hey, where are you taking it? I'm so sorry I hope you can forgive me "Reporter, Nam Ga-hee" - Is that you? - You recognize my voice Track the caller! Who the hell are you? Why are you doing this?! You really don't know? - I don't, you son of a bitch! - Language, Your Honor... Don't get heated up so fast I haven't even started, yet Tell me! Why are you doing this? You wanna know why? My life got fucked up thanks to your ruling How much longer do we need? 20 seconds I'll never let you get away with this! How dare you hurt a judge's family! I'm going to make you feel the same pain! I'll make you pay! That's not the proper way to talk for a judge now, is it? My life is already fucked up There is nothing that I can't do now We got him! Just remember this... that this is just the beginning Yellow is a sweet color But, that's what makes them noticeable, you know? - Good morning! Nursery - This is Ye-jin's dad Could you put her on the phone please? She's out on a field trip today A field trip? Open the door! - Who are you? - Mr. Kim! Ye-jin! Ye-jin! - Ye-jin! - Daddy? Get ready for a stake out Yes, sir - Did you get them? - Yes. These are rulings from your recent cases Thanks! Why don't' you just leave it to the police? He holds a grudge against me There's gotta be something here We're connected Mr. Lee Hello? It's me, man! You got no-one else calling you! Listen, I got so drunk last night... - It's me, Jung-woon - Yes. I have more cases What do you want me to do? Bring them to me Last night... You know, the park around the corner from my house... I found these two chicks there and got their numbers I ain't kidding, you know? Give him some money and tell him to get lost You just woke up? Take your lazy ass out and find yourself a job! I'll grab some chicken takeout You want fried or marinated? Half each? Okay Over here! Quickly You're so full of shit! - It's for real! - You serious? How many times do I have to tell you? If you stand here like this... Somebody will come and give you ten bucks? I told you I wasn't lying Just wait and see I'll kill you if it's bullshit Just wait up... You said he'll show from here I see nobody! Are you using the phone? It's a match Shouldn't you get some rest? God damn it! They could all be suspects I really believed that the rulings were fair at the time but looking back, they're full of error Look... He looks like the guy we saw on Yongma mountains Turn around I said turn around! Fuck you! - Get him! - Get him! Get him! Get him! ...and made a call to Judge Kim Say it! We got you on a surveillance camera by the phone booth around 9:00pm You killed Bae Yoon-kyung and dumped her body that day... We got a confession We've got evidence here You still have hard feelings from last year's trial? Seok-hyun, I'll take care of things here Go home Don't get heated up so fast I haven't even started, yet Kang-sung... can I see the statement? What are you talking about? When he called me two nights ago, he didn't seem to know about Yoon-kyung's death Here, it says he buried her body and took the ring from her left finger She was left-handed. She wore her rings on the right finger But, he confessed! And it wasn't a forced confession under duress? Kim Seok-hyun! The motherfucker who killed Yoon-kyung... I'm just as angry about him as you Just leave this to me Hello? Your honor, they got the killer today, didn't they? Leave me alone The man that killed Judge Han's wife got arrested today 30 years ago On January 17th I was doing some research on you for an article Like Prof. Sohn's Parallel Theory, the parallels between you and Judge Han are too uncanny "professor poisons his wife" "I move as my fate dictates" "I didn't commit a murder... but was destined for murder" Coincidences are mathematically impossible! He and I have the same fate Because our lives are exactly the same! Judge Kim? I read your statement thoroughly From birth to growing up, your academic achievements, even the fact that you both sought exile... there seemed to be a lot of parallels in you and Godel's life But, according to your book, for the theory to stand the dates and result should match at the least which means you must die of starvation today, the same day Godel died But, you're still alive You proved your own theory wrong Red eye Pardon? Red eye Red eye... Red eye? How did you manage to become a judge with a brain like that? Why did you poison your wife? I never poisoned her She put the poison in my food I only switched it with her food You're still making excuses It's not an excuse... It's a fate and there is nothing you can do! It must be so easy for you You can blame everything on fate I can't do that. Because you make your own fate That's why I feel it was my fault that my wife was murdered Subtitle by Aldi Arman What? Professor Sohn... really? C.O.D. Was cardiac arrest due to malnutrition He basically died of starvation And the time of death? 7:00am this morning 7:00am... this morning... But, it's 19th today - Red eye - Red eye... Doesn't red eye mean... It's the time difference! He meant bloodshot eyes from the time difference Seok-hyun! Are you being serious? You know you're starting to sound like the crazy old man... You said yourself that Lincoln and Kennedy coincidences were uncanny I meant, for a coincidence! The time difference... Godel and Sohn's significant dates were all a-day-apart They were in fact, the same dates They did live identical lives till the day they died... How did I miss that? So, you're gonna find out how much your life resembles Judge Han's? Our lives have too many parallels 30 years apart Even the fact that Yoon-kyung died So, you have the parallels, so what? They already got the killer! What if Jang wasn't the killer? Maybe I can find the real killer by looking into Han's past Han's father passed away on the day of appointment? Father! The motive for the crime wasn't evil but considering that it was his second offense, I sentence the defendant to 1 year imprisonment My daughter will die if I go to prison! She's got no-one to look after her Show mercy, your honor... Please!! - Hello! - Hello, sir I have a question for you... Do you know anything about Judge Han's murder case? I heard you studied law with him... People seem to be asking questions about him lately Do you know about the case? He was threatened by someone Who in the end killed his family That's all I know Yoo Hyun-sung made the threats? Yoo Hyun-sung... was that his name? What are you saying, bastard? You were at Judge Kim's house that day, weren't you? Does that make me the killer? What were you doing there that day? You're driving me nuts! Are you playing games with me? Bring Kim Seok-hyun here What? Killer, Yoo Hyun-sung Jang Soo-young "1979.1.9 wife Koh Eun-hee murdered" "1979.1.12 Mt. Acha..." "2009.1.12 a body found in Mt. Yongma" "we're in need of a trustworthy judiciary" "1979.1.25 Han's family murdered" "Killer Yoo Hyun-sung, Jang Soo-young" What are you doing, honey? I'm cleaning up Yepi To make her pretty again Good girl! You're a big girl now, aren't you? Who's going to clean me now? You're late I dropped Ye-jin off at my in-law's Why? We had an intruder at home Are you sure about that? I don't know But, there was someone there Are you sure? I mean, with everything that happened lately... Do I look crazy to you? I hope I am mistaken, too "Rulings 1979 #2" Han Sang-jun, Han Sang-jun... Excuse me... What's in that room? It's a restricted area, so I don't know for sure But, you can't gain access without a clearance There was a reporter who applied for access but she was refused A female reporter? It's no use Han trial script is not in the general reading room If I'm right, it must be kept in the restricted section How do I know that? Well, I think I already gave you all the answers Now? Ms. Nam! Ms. Nam! This way, sir! I'm the reporter assigned to the Sohn murder case Judge Han's wife was murdered, too on the same day, 30 years ago The reporter was killed? - But, why? - I don't know But one thing is clear It wasn't Jang Soo-young who killed her What now? The reporter's murder, is that your case? Are you assigned to that, too? No, I read it in the paper I got curious because I used to know her I was called to the scene She was dead by the time we got there If I'm right, the transcript must be kept in the restricted section What do you think? Do you think you can decode it? It's a clean sample You see the number of prints overlapping on the number? The print on number you pressed first can be revealed like this By lifting up the prints, one by one you can work out the number of prints on the other numbers You're working late I've got some research to do I see I thought you went home I left something behind Who left the lights on here? A hopeless security... What are you doing here? I was looking up some case law What's taking you so long, man? Hurry up! Hey! Answer me! Hey!! Damn... It's a piece of rag! All the important parts have been torn out The summary's still there, though C.O.D. For Judge Han's wife was blunt head trauma, too On January 9, the same day that Yoon-kyung was murdered Mt. Acha, Mt. Acha... And, the other three were killed in the annex Did he have two children? No. Just one son Jung Min-soo was Judge Han's deputy director He was killed with the Hans Do you know a woman called Yoo Jung-mi? You mean the young mom? She's in there Yoo Hyun-sung was your father, wasn't he? Dad went to see the judge because he felt aggrieved and he couldn't control his anger You know, he had begged him for mercy for the sake of his young children He wanted to ask him in his face if he really had to put him away But, by the time he got there everyone was already dead That's what my father told me He said at least I should know the truth that he wasn't a murderer Hello? The result just came back and I have the case detective's name Gyonggi Province, Seong-nam... Are you detective Park? Not anymore I left a long time ago Who are you anyway? I'm from the court I have some questions for you About what? Regarding a case from 30 years ago 30 years ago? Who could remember that far back? It's Judge Han's case The judge's case? I remember that one It's very unusual for a judge to be murdered Yoo Hyun-sung killed the judge's wife and killed the rest of the family a few days later It was an easy case for us MOD was consistent and he was arrested at the crime scene The whole process took a week from booking to ruling That's gotta be a record When did you arrest him? On 26th... Yes, I'm sure it was January 26th 26th... the arrest date is different It can't be Jang Soo-young - What now? - Someone tried to kill me! What are talking about? Someone out there is watching me He's blocking my way! What the hell are you talking about, man? While Jang Soo-young is in custody... He got away What? He hit the detective in the head and jumped off from the 2nd floor Do you still think it's not Jang Soo-young? Yoo hyun-sung escaped, didn't he? Did he? Why did you hide the truth? I had to obey an order of my superior in that time I had to save my own neck Everyone lived like that Then, initially, the arrest was made on January 17th? That sounds about right "judge's family massacred" "Han family murdered" "Reporter Nam Ga-hee" Well, I think I already gave you all the answers "articles on Han case" "To Judge Kim Seok-hyun" The judge in charge? "Case judge for Han murder" Do you know about Judge Han's murder case? Judge Han? Let me think... Ye-jin! Ye-jin!! Where are you? Seok-hyun, What's the matter with you? How is it possible for the case judge to not know about his case? They have the killer in custody Why are you hung up on an old case? And, what's this got to do with Han Sang-jun? It's identical. His past and mine are an exact match! Do you really believe the crazy professor's theory? I don't want to But, things keep happening that makes me believe What? The times and places... How Yoon-kyung was murdered and that Jang escaping these events are exactly identical except the 30-year gap If only I know the truth... You can stop what will happen? Seok-hyun, Judge Han's wife was found dead in Acha my daughter was discovered in Yongma Don't you know that Mt. Yongma used to be Mt. Acha? You told me that yourself at Yongma mountains They all used to be called Mt. Acha... Most of the latter part of the ruling is torn out I want to know what was there I don't know The judiciary system wasn't as transparent back then I just signed the ruling, as I was supposed to Ye-jin! Ye-jin! Ye-jin? Uncle Jung will pick you up after nursery Stay with the teacher at all times It's a statute-barred case The original ruling isn't kept in the DA's office God damn it! But, while looking at the information, I found that the police took back some of the documents with them Who did? - And, what is this? - An apple tree! That's right. It's an apple tree - What color are the leaves? - Green! Detective Park Eun-bong, the detective in charge of the case January 25, 1979 Was it you that killed Han's family, too? And, you killed the reporter and attacked me to cover it up Ye-jin! Ye-jin! I used to be a detective A stupid one who took pride in the force even after getting injured and crippled in action Why would the stupid detective go around putting blood on his hands? I spent my whole life serving as the hands and legs for them It a closed-down workshop nearby. Please, hurry! Uncle Jung! What do you want? What do I want? Tell Kim Seok-hyun to come He's not picking up No! Call him yourself, if you don't believe me He's really not picking up Jung-woon! - Jung-woon! - Daddy... Ye-jin!! Ye-jin... Are you okay? I'm her father Kang-sung... - Ye-jin! - Daddy... Everything's okay now What happened? I'll tell you about it later If it wasn't for Mr. Lee... You should pay more attention Thanks! I don't want you to be miserable It's okay, baby... Are you all right? Thanks She's like a daughter to me, too I'll stay here just in case... No Go home And, don't come tomorrow Tomorrow is the 25th Judge Han, his son and the deputy director died together We should not be around each other tomorrow, no matter what You're still hung up on parallel theory? You saw what Jang Soo-young did today... Yeah... Maybe Jang is the killer and I'm completely wrong about this But, I want to avoid that situation I cannot lose you or Ye-jin What's the exact C.O. D? Deputy director Jung Min-soo and the son Han Jung-woo both have what appears to be gunshot wounds Any signs of blunt force trauma? As for Judge Han, it's difficult tell conclusively from the picture but, there is a sizable bruising around the neck I served as hands and legs for them What is it? Can you take care of Ye-jin? What about Jung-woon? They must not be around each other today. No matter what! Why? Are you suspecting him? It's not like that Just do it for me She may get upset without me around Please comfort her What brings you here? You know Park Eun-bong, don't you? Detective Park, 30 years ago, Homicide, Mapo District Park Eun-bong... Is this about Han case again? We haven't played in a while, have we? Park got himself into troubles after he got his leg injury someone has been watching his back It was you who got his back until his retirement, wasn't it? Don't make a wild guess Why did you get the reporter killed and tried to kill me, too? - What? - Shall I tell? It was because you didn't want anyone get to the truth - The truth? - Yes, the truth! In the report, it said they obtained blunt trauma but, the crime scene pictures suggest that Han was strangled His son and Jung Min-soo had gunshot wounds Does it make sense... for a petty thief like Yoo hyun-sung to have an access to a firearm? What are you suggesting? That Yoo wasn't the killer? If he was, there would have been no reason to cover up Which means that Yoo wasn't the vicious murderer but a victim of a cover-up How can you make such claims as a judge? You and Judge Han were classmates But, Han was a step ahead of you at everything Weren't you envious of him for everything he had? The judiciary was in need of a hero who would save it from its image as a puppet Han was just that man. He represented the authority of the judiciary but, after his wife died, there were filthy rumors about him We couldn't allow our hero to fall victim of such rumors So, you made Yoo Hyun-sung a murderer to protect the judiciary's authority They were all dead and Yoo Hyun-sung was at the scene In the story you made up! After murdering his entire family out of jealousy, in order to cover up the crime, you fabricated the ruling! How could I? I was the case prosecutor, not the judge The prosecutor? Didn't you know I served as a DA? A prosecutor... You still think Jang isn't the killer? The man who's been staring at your wife Jung-woon! It's Lee Kang-sung! Prosecutor Lee!! - Pardon? - Ye-jin is in danger Kang-sung is in my house with Ye-jin I'll be on my way Take Ye-jin and go to your place! Right now! Ye-jin! Are you awake? Ye-jin! Ye-jin! Ye-jin! Ye-jin! Where are you? Ye-jin! Ye-jin! Ye-jin! Ye-jin! Ye-jin! Ye-jin! - Uncle Jung! - Ye-jin! - Uncle Jung! - Ye-jin! He's got a gun Ye-jin! Seo Jung-woon! Son of a bitch! Fuck! - Hello? - Mr. Lee. It's Detective Lee Yes We spotted Jang Soo-young near Judge Kim's house Is that right? We'll be there in any minutes I'll meet you there, sir Got it! Fuck... Jung-woon! Jung-woon! Jung-woon... but, after his wife died, there were filthy rumors about him - Hello? - You're here Why are you there, judge? What if Ye-jin and I were there, too? Are you with her now? Is she all right? We weren't gonna see each other today Let's meet up now I'll be right over The man who makes you feel smothered just by being around What? So perfect that there is no room for you to get into It's what your wife said about you What are you talking about? We started off as friends and I've been cleaning up after you for 10 years now What? According to the parallel theory, it must be my fate to spend my life wiping your ass Where is my daughter? If I die with you as dictated by the theory, at least my life will become similar to yours I said where's my daughter? Would you like a hint? A criminal will always return to the scene of the crime Son of a bitch! Where the hell are you? Hello? Hello? Koh Eun-hee... Mt. Acha Koh Eun-hee... Mt. Acha Bae Yoon-kyung... Mt. Yongma Koh Eun-hee... Mt. Acha Han Jung-woo, Jung Min-soo... The annex... The annex The annex? They got killed being in the same room We must never be around each other! What would have happened if we were there? We weren't gonna meet today Who will give me a bath? The annex... The annex... You followed my clue Shut up! I only followed the theory Maybe that's why You wanted to avoid being in Judge Han's situation Here we are, all together thanks to you Where is Ye-jin? Seok-hyun, Isn't that weird though? They died in the same room which mean we'll die together, too But, there is no-one except us Now what? Will we end up killing each other? Where is my daughter? Or will a third person do the job? Let me know if there is anything Yes, sir Why didn't you just let it go when we got Jang Soo-young? If you did, we didn't have to come this far - Why did you do it? Why? - Don't you understand? I had to catch Yoon-kyung's killer! How could you do that? To a good wife and mother... A good wife? A good wife makes a place like this at home to be with another man? What? What is this place? We'll be safer here than in your apartment Are you crazy? It makes it all the more thrilling He would have never guessed What's wrong? Let's end it here I can't do this anymore... for the sake of Seok-hyun So, you went on a blind date! To get away from me? Did you think I would let you go so easily? You think I won't dare? I made a place like this behind my husband's back Do you think anything can stop me? Liar! The fact she was a promiscuous woman everyone knew that including her father and DA Lee Only you didn't know! Shut up! Not another word! Only you didn't know! You thought you were so smart but everyone was laughing at you behind your back Shut the fuck up! Fucking bastard! She wasn't like that! She was never like that! No! Wake up, son of a bitch! Can't you see? No! Daddy... Ye-jin! Don't touch her! - Please, don't do that... - Please, don't do that... Ye-jin is... Jung-woo is... - She's my daughter - He's my son I really wanted to end it I wanted to get away But, the reason I couldn't... was her Because she's my daughter Daddy! Ye-jin... Let's go with daddy Daddy... - Daddy... daddy... - Ye-jin! Ye-jin Come here Come to daddy Daddy... Ye-jin... No Ye-jin Ye-jin No Seok-hyun... Sang-jun... I think Jung-woo's awake... He'll go back to sleep What if he hears him and wakes up? He won't... I gave a bit of that He never got woken up after that pill "...may cause hallucination, short-term memory loss..." How did it go, baby? Baby... Honey... please! Yoon-kyung... Open your eyes! Yoon-kyung... Yoon-kyung... Would you like a clue? A criminal always returns to the scene of the crime No... No... There is no such thing as parallel life I'm not Han Sang-jun! I'm not Han Sang-jun! I'm not Han Sang-jun! I wasn't gonna do this I was so aggrieved... and I couldn't let the anger go...
