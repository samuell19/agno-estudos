It's going to be a very good Christmas. Good morning. Hi. 24 more days till Christmas. We need to step up our game. Looks like it might snow. Yeah, as long as it stays within picturesque limits. I don't want the weather to slow down the sales. Christmas isn't all about the numbers. It's the biggest selling season of the year. It's also a holiday. Can we throw in some merriment? I market Christmas, I don't have time to celebrate it. The last time I got a tree, it withered from neglect. You are not that cynical. I, for a fact, know that you are downright nice. Christmas wasn't real big in our house. After my mom died, the holidays just... Kind of lost their meaning. I got presents, but none of the sentiment. Anyway, a happy client means a happy account exec, and that is the joy that I hope to get from the holidays. Good morning, maddie. I am loving this new office. Well, you've earned it, every square inch of it. Now... Are you ready to dazzle Hadley? Absolutely. Excellent. Good. Christmas is Maddie's specialty. She's the best we've got. Your numbers are falling short, but I believe we can turn it around. Which is why I'm here. The Pre-Christmas sales are as crucial to the bottom line as the after-Christmas sales. Your ads need to appeal to shoppers on three levels, the holidays, the prices, and the clothing... Which I love, by the way. And, you know, when you can turn your marketing exec into a customer, you are doing something really right. You wear our merchandize well. I can sell it even better. Let me get the marketing on par with the clothing. Okay. Yes! We'll roll out the new campaign by the end of the week. Right. Uh-huh... Yeah. Well, it's fine to include a younger demographic, but we can't ignore the gen-xers... Mm-hmm. Go easy on the red and green. Christmas can't overwhelm the clothes. Yeah. Exactly. Okay. The holiday countdown has begun. Try to have it on my desk by tomorrow morning. Hmm. There's a wedding invitation. Who's it from? Irene Parker. She's my biggest client. She runs the largest clothing chain in the country, and she's inviting me to her wedding? You can thank Irene for this view. She's the reason why I got this promotion. It says the wedding is on the 11th of December, and I'm just getting this now? The mailroom must have sent it to your old office. I can't afford to offend her. What do we do? Email her assistant, and say I'll be attending, and explain the delay in my response. You sure about this? The wedding is next week, it's in Denver, you're afraid to fly... Well, I can't let that stop me. I gotta go to this wedding. I'll take the train, I'll get there in plenty of time. Okay, I'll book you a seat. Maddie Duncan's office. It's your cousin, Teddy. Oh. Hi, Teddy, how are you? I got a new job. I'm moving to London. Congratulations. That sounds exciting. You remember my mother's classic mustang fastback? Of course, I do, I loved that thing. I keep it stored in the garage, but I'm selling the house. I'd like to keep it in the family. You interested? You bet I am. Does it run okay? Well, it's in mint condition. I take it for a spin every now and again myself. Well, what a happy coincidence. It just so happens, I am in need of a car right now. Then it's yours. All right, great. Thanks, Teddy. Bye. Forget the train, I'm driving to Denver. Okay. My aunt Vivian, she was this flamboyant substitute mom. She used to pick me up in her jazzy vintage mustang and take me on all these great adventures. They're some of the happiest moments of my childhood. Hmm, so now you'll go on a new adventure. Yeah, I guess so. Not a scratch or dent on 'er. You better take care of 'er. Oh, wow! It's just like I remember. Well... Mom would have wanted you to have it. I'm driving to Denver to go to a wedding. That's ambitious. They're expecting some pretty serious weather, aren't they? Yeah, I'll get there before then. You know me, it's better than flying, oh, thank you, Teddy! Merry Christmas.

Uh, yeah, actually, I, uh, just called the highway patrol, so. Um... That's rude of me here, uh... I'm Kevin, by the way. Hi. Maddie. Nice to meet you. Funny place to meet, huh? Yeah, it's like a horizontal forest. This is just awful, though, delaying everyone like this. How does something like this happen? I have such a long drive ahead of me. I can't sit here all day... Well, I can assure both of you that... It wasn't intentional. What are you doing? It's his truck. He's the one who dropped his trees. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize they were yours. Not as sorry as me. Well... it was an accident, right? Yeah, maddie, thanks for taking my side. Okay, if you two are done getting acquainted, I have somewhere to be. Well, there's no need to be rude. I'm stuck here for who knows how long, I'm cold, I'm hungry... I haven't eaten since Pittsburgh, you don't see me complaining. Looks like you're outnumbered. It's nice to meet you, maddie. You too. These interstate relationships never work out. Appreciate the advice, pal. Yeah.

What seems to be the problem? I don't know, it started making this thumping sound, then it started driving funny, and then it just died. Mind if I take a look? Yeah, please. What do you think it is? It's hard to say what's wrong. It could be the distributor, maybe the alternator. I'd have to run some more tests to say for sure. I thought this thing was in mint condition. Oh, it is in mint condition, just, you know, except for the broken parts. You know, it's an old car, I might have to order some of the parts online. Well, how long will that take? Shouldn't be more than a day or two. A day or...! No, no, no, I have to get to Denver. It's extremely important. I don't even know where I am, or how I got here. You're in Christmas valley. Okay, um, is there a motel around here? Uh, about 60 miles down the way. But there's a boarding house, I could take you over there if you want. A boarding house? Yeah, I'll take you there now. Okay. Thanks. That would be great. This town really lives up to its name. I'm guessing you're from the city. New York. That's a long way from home. Yeah, a million miles. His name is rowdy. Hi! That name seems appropriate. Are you coming? You've got a new boarder. I like to think of them as friends I haven't met yet. Oh, how very nice of you! -I'm Jo. -Maddie. Hello. Bob Harding. Nice to meet you. Hello. What brings you to Christmas valley? Uh, a broken car. Oh! That's quite a handshake you have there. I'm sorry, force of habit. I'm a traveling salesman. Oh, what do you sell? Not enough. Luckily, Pam here takes in strays till they can get back up on their feet. Am I a stray? Oh, no, sweetheart. She stays with me when her dad's away. Well, rowdy and I are strays. He showed up last Christmas and just never left. Well, I'll only be here a day or two. Let's get you settled in. Okay. I'll get that. Santa Claus? That'd be too corny, even for me. That's Jeremy Christmas. He founded the town a hundred years ago. And the resemblance to Santa is accidental? He played it up a bit. He was actually sort of short and skinny, but from the chin up, he fit the bill. Are you related? His wife was my grandfather's cousin. When I got the place, I felt an obligation to keep up the Christmas theme. Well, you certainly managed to do that. In an over-the-top, wall-to-wall sort of way. It works, though. I was stranded, and you've managed to distract me. My car broke down on the way to Denver. Now I don't know where I am, or what I'm going to do. Well, can I get you something to eat? It's almost dinner time. Thank you, but I am exhausted. It's been a pretty difficult day. Let me show you to your room. I'll see you in the morning. Okay. Bye. So, this is your room. Oh, it's lovely. Let me know if you need anything. Thank you. Christmas valley... Good morning, maddie! Welcome to Christmas valley. Maddie and I have the same hair color. Yeah, you do. But she has the prettiest eyes. Yeah, she does. Well, maddie is going to love this. It depends on if she likes Christmas cuisine. Who wouldn't like green eggs? Uh, let's hold off on the sprinkles. She's pretty sophisticated. Who wouldn't like sprinkles? A stranded new yorker. Um, just a couple. Mm-hmm. Not the eggs. Okay. Oops, I missed! I got some on the eggs. That's okay, we'll bring them to the table anyway. I wonder if she's up yet. Should I go and see? Mm-hmm. It's okay, I'm up. Green eggs. In honor of the season. Well, it looks great. Wait till you try the pancakes. So, a traveling salesman, huh? Yeah, I'm a real anachronism. What's that? A person or thing belonging to an earlier era. Bob knows about everything that starts with the letter "a." I used to sell encyclopedias, and my sample was volume one, so every time I got bored on the road, I'd just crack it open and memorize another "a." Go ahead, try me. "Aardvark." A burrowing, nocturnal animal native to Africa. "Alaska." No, pretty sure it's Africa. "Alaska." Ah! 49th state, largest in the union, capital is Juneau. "Angel!" That's easy. You look up "angel" in the encyclopedia, and there's a picture of you. What do you do, maddie? I am in marketing. Actually, I have a lot of work to do, so I'm going to take this breakfast to my room. Thanks. She's so pretty. A fashionable fish-out-of-water. "Abozzo." "A rough sketch." Gotcha. I'm looking at the Hadley account right now, and the copy is all wrong. We need to appeal to the upscale shopper. Okay, how do we do that? Shh! Did you just shush me? Oh, sorry, no, not you. Sorry. What is that? Uh, it's a dog. He came with the room. I can't picture you in a boarding house. Looks like you made a new friend. Who's that guy? That's Bob. He's a traveling salesman. Oh, this gets better and better. Pam says not to feed rowdy. -Oh... -Who's that? Uh, that's Jo. She sounds like a kid. Yeah, that's 'cause she is a kid. A kid and a dog? And all the Christmas I can handle. Get me the latest sales reports, and I'll call you back later this afternoon. All right, will do. Talk to you soon. All right, bye, Roz. You wanna take rowdy for a walk? I have a lot of work to do, so maybe later. Or we could watch a movie on TV. Maybe. You know that kid in "home alone?" Mm-hmm? This boy in my class looks exactly like him. How can you tell if a boy likes you? Um... Maybe that's a question you should ask your mom. I can't ask her. That's how come I'm asking you. She passed away when I was six. I'm so sorry, Jo. You must really miss her, huh? Yeah. Especially at Christmas. Yeah. I know how you feel. My dad is coming home today. I'll be going back to the farm. Well, I'm really glad I got a chance to meet you. Do you want to take rowdy for a walk before I go? Okay. Yay! Okay, we're here. Where? Home. You live here? Mm-hmm. Wow, this is absolutely beautiful. It's like a portrait of Christmas. Wow... Maddie? It's you. Y-You know my dad? Yeah... no... Not exactly. Actually we met on the interstate, honey. Yeah, then I got off and I got lost, and I ended up in Christmas valley. Well, isn't that lucky? Yeah... Yeah, what are the odds? Yeah. Come on in. Honey, could you get the door? -Yeah. -Thanks, love. Are you starting the fire? Yes, babe. This place is so nice. It's not what you expected, huh? No, this is my first farmhouse. I've only had "little house on the prairie" as a reference. Well, we even have indoor plumbing. So, listen, maddie, um, where are you from? New York. Yeah? Please, have a seat. And where were you headed, before I derailed you? To a wedding in Denver. -Friends or family? -Client. It's a business thing. What line of work are you in? I am in marketing. Mostly women's clothing. Okay... Is that how come you dress up? Kind of, it's part of the job. She's gonna be a standout, isn't she, here in Christmas valley? Mm-hmm. Sorry. So, how long have you had this place? Oh, it's a family farm. I took it over after my dad retired. Daddy... -Yeah, honey? -Can she stay for dinner? I mean, look, Jo, we just... I should get back to Pam's. I have, um... I have a lot of calls to make. Right, and it's kind of getting dark out there, honey. Okay. But, hey, why don't we give her a lift? Okay! Okay. All right... After you. So, is this a tourist-town, or are you guys just crazy about Christmas? Come on, no, it's just an average small town. I mean, the name does tend to make us go a bit overboard. Jeremy Christmas certainly left his Mark. What if his name was Jeremy Easter? Oh, well, then we would be knee-deep in rabbits every spring, sweetheart. Have you always lived here? No, no, I did a stint in Boston when I was in college. But you prefer Christmas valley? I do. Yeah. Yeah. I've never seen a prettier place or met nicer people. So I came home. I'm strictly Manhattan, born and raised. Good to know. I'm strictly Christmas valley. Born and raised, right? Yes, you are. Well, thanks again, Pam, for looking after Jo. Always a pleasure. -You ready to go, pumpkin? -Yeah. Well, thanks for the ride. Yeah, well, it's a small town, I'm sure I'll see you around. Me too. I'd like that. Oh. Hey, Roz, hang on a minute. Thanks again, guys. Bye! Is it just me, or did those two seem like a nice fit? New York is a pretty long commute. That's just geography. If it's meant to happen, it will. Send me everything you have for the Hadley account, copy, artwork... Ooh, what are you going to do about the wedding? I mean, what about Irene? No, don't even mention the wedding. Every time I think about it, I get nervous. My sentiments exactly. This is so good. Of course, it always is. You're pretty easy to please. Could I get some more Christmas biscuit? Mm-hmm. Good morning. Hey, maddie. Did you sleep okay? Actually, I did, and so did rowdy, once I let him in. Oh, I hope that's okay. Oh, yeah, he's hard not to like. Can I get you something? Actually, no, I think I'm going to walk into town. -Okay. -Thanks. Have fun. More for me. ♪ Everywhere 'Tis the season... ♪ Excuse me, where's a good place to eat around here? Stan's, it's right over there. -Oh, thank you. -You're welcome. ♪ ...time of year Club sandwich! Pick it up! -Hi. -Hi! I'm Holly. You must be the girl with the red mustang. Hey, small town, word gets around. Is it too late to get breakfast? Nah, Luke can make you some eggs. Luke! Yeah? Hi. Egg whites only, and some whole wheat toast, please? Coming right up. I'm the owner, and I just gave myself a coffee break. What happened to Stan? Oh, he's my uncle. He got married and moved to Cleveland a couple weeks ago. I never thought I'd end up in an apron. You know you are talking to the former miss Ohio, runner-up. Well, now that Stan is gone, maybe you should think about renaming the place. Yeah, I guess, but, I mean, what to? How about "Holly's"? -Hmm. -How about... "Reluctant Holly's"? Hey, I didn't know this would be my thing. You could make it your thing. Yeah, I know, I guess we should redecorate. Got any ideas? Well, given the town's affection for Christmas, I'd probably go with that. That is a good idea. I grew up here, my affection for Christmas is off the hook. Stan wouldn't even let us put up a tree. Ah-ah-ah, my place now. You know, you could do a whole holiday theme. Like, the colors, the ambiance, the menu. -Hmm... -Young lady, are you in the restaurant business? I'm in marketing. Well, lucky for me you wandered in here. I'll take all the advice I can get. Don't target kids directly, you know, but just evoke the child in all of us. I mean, Christmas is about memories, right? That's what makes it such a good marketing tool. Ooh, maybe you could have a jukebox that only plays Christmas music. What? Oh, nothing, I just... Sounded like a pretty calculated take on Christmas. Hmm, well, that calculated take has earned me a pretty good living. I just don't think the holidays should be about dollars and cents. This from a man who sells Christmas trees. Hey, I fulfill a need at a fair price. I love what I do, and working the land is a day well spent. Hmm. Well, I fulfill the need for a discounted price. The clients are happy and so are the customers. And what about you? I'm tickled pink. Ah. Don't you have to go till the soil on your farm or something? No, you know, Christmas trees don't require much tilling. Ah. I'll see you around, maddie. You need a new exit line. Okay. You look really pretty when you talk marketing. Holly. Egg-white omelette! That was kinda fun to watch. What are you reading? A client's sales reports. Ooh, looks like a real page-Turner. That's really pretty. Puts me in the Christmas mood. Hmm. I took rowdy for a walk. It is a beautiful day. Did your dad go away again? No, he's around. I just came over to see you. So... whatcha up to? Is that your homework? Kind of. I need to see if my marketing is working. What's marketing exactly? Well, you know when you buy a bag of chips? Okay, so something made you pick that bag over all the others, so I help companies sell their brand. She's a salesman, Jo, just like me. Now, I imagine she has a title and makes more money, but I get to wear comfortable shoes. Well, not a bad line of work if you're into shoes. Ask him another "a"! Okay, hmm... Alexander the great. Ah... A Greek king who conquered half the world wearing no shoes at all. You could've been a copywriter. And leave my rented room in Christmas valley? It's a really special place. Well, that's what my dad says. Almost as special as you. ♪ 6 steps to the middle of the floor... ♪ - Well, look who's here! - Hello. Hi! You know, we really got to stop meeting like this. Egg-white omelette, please. All these chance encounters, maddie, are you following me? You're the one who dropped your trees. Then you show up in my home town. How's Jo? She's okay. How do you feel about her dad? I haven't decided. I love all the holiday touches. Thank you! Yes, Holly, I will second that. Leaving already, kev? Yeah, I gotta go plant some trees. Speaking of trees, maddie, uh, you want to join me? Share in the joy of working the land? Something like that. I wish I could, but I have to edit some copy, so... Yeah. Okay, maybe next time. Oh, there won't be a next time, she lives in New York. So... Oh. Then maybe she needs to seize the day. I guess I could carve out a little time. Uh, but you might want to change, you're a little overdressed for farming. Oh, this is as farm-worthy as it's going to get. I was packing for Denver and a client that owns a chain of clothing stores. I wanted to impress her with my impeccable taste. Oh, it is so impeccable. -Thank you. -It's impeccable. Um, fine, okay. Let's try to get your mind off Denver for a while, shall we? Good luck, it's only my career at stake. See you later, buddy. Ooh! My money's on Kevin. She forgot her eggs, though. So, how long until they're fully grown? Oh, about eight years. I wonder who's going to get this tree. I want you to go to a good home. Look at you, the well-dressed farmer communing with her crop. What happened to the trees on the interstate? Um, well, they were too damaged for delivery, so I missed out on another tree lot. Wow, one delivery matters that much? Yeah, it does. Last Christmas, we had a flood, and we lost a lot of trees. Then the tree lots, they turned to the big suppliers. I just can't afford to, uh, lose the few I have left. Matter of fact, I don't even usually plant trees in December, but... I don't know how much longer I'm going to have this farm. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah. These I've been growing since seed. I've got about a hundred of these left or so... It's a bit of a sentimental gesture, but I want to plant every single one of them you know, while the farm is still mine. Oh, so this is a special occasion. I guess so. Well then, I am glad to be here. I'm gonna go get some more trees, dad! Okay, honey. You know, last year, we had two farmhands, now it's just me. And the hardest part is being away from her every time I have to make a delivery. The important thing is how much you care. Thanks. My father was always working when I was a kid. Mm-hmm? What did he do? He had an ad agency. Hence my name, Madison, as in Madison Avenue. So I guess, uh, marketing is in the genes, then, huh? I guess so. He remarried and had more kids. We're not close. Just a congratulatory call when I get a promotion. What about your mom? She died when I was a kid. Maddie, I'm sorry. She'll be fine. Nothing matters more to me. You know, fatherhood is your best feature. Yeah, I read the documents you sent me, and Hadley's numbers are up, but we need to boost same-store sales. -When will you get to Denver? -Thursday. Friday, the latest. The wedding is on Saturday. I know, don't worry, I'll be there. I'd better be, after all this. ♪ My baby's gonna spread her wings ♪ ♪ live her life through the beautiful night ♪ ♪ forever and ever hold her tight ♪ ♪ me and my heart every day and every night ♪ ♪ she's my beautiful angel my dream come true ♪ ♪ there's nothing rather that I'd like to do ♪ ♪ but be here in this moment with you... ♪ -Whoa! -You sound really good! Oh, thanks. You should do a YouTube video or something. Well, the band and I are trying to get our names out there, you know, but lots of competition, so... Yeah, get some buzz going. Maybe a Christmas song, that's an easy sell this time of year. I might just do that. Making music is half the battle, the other half is getting it out there. So, any word on my alternator? Oh, yeah, they shipped it. It should be here by tomorrow. Okay, I really need to get on the road. Listen, I'll let you know as soon as it gets here, all right? -Okay. Thank you. -Of course. -Great song. -Thank you. -Hey. -Hey. Uh, can I give you a lift? No. Too much adrenaline, I need to walk it off. Is this because I dropped my trees? No. My car would've broken down anyway. Better here than somewhere else. The thing is, I'm afraid to fly. It's the turbulence. One little bump, and, like, I practically pass out. But you've tried it, I mean, you've flown before, right? Yes, once. What? I just prefer to travel by Internet. The thing is, this wedding requires that I'm actually there in person, so... Must be an important wedding. Yeah, the bride is my biggest client, whose business I would like to keep. It's actually a really big deal that she even invited me. Well, I'll be sorry to see you go. Well... Take care. Yeah. You too. Bye. I wish you were going to be here for Christmas. Aw... I want to get you a present before I leave. I don't want a toy or anything. Okay. What would you like? To hang out with you. Aw... Come to the farm, I can teach you how to make a wreath! I wouldn't even know how to hang one, but okay, whatever you want. I like your wreath there, maddie. This is so out of my wheelhouse, but so much fun. Do you want any more bows and Holly? Yes. I need all the filler I can get. You know, if this marketing thing doesn't work out, you, uh, you have a fallback. Oh, yeah. If only New York could see me now. -Hey, Roz. -Hey, maddie. How you doing? Roz, you will not believe this... I am making a wreath. Mr. Warren is here. He'd like a word with you. Hi, maddie, listen, Hadley wants a presentation on the after-Christmas sales campaign. Yes, sir, absolutely, I am on it. Excellent. Roz will give you all the info. Right. Is everything okay? Yeah. Just a work thing. It's fine. Okay, so where were we? Bows and Holly. Hey... Who said wreaths have to be round, huh? Oh... Do you want any more berries? Uh, yes, as soon as I answer this email... Okay, I'm back. Sorry. It might be my boss. Hello? Roz, I can't... I can't hear you. Oh... My battery is dying, I have to go charge it. I'm so sorry, Jo. That's okay. Girl, we busy today. This place looks great. I ordered the sign, I got a few more tables. "Holly's" is really becoming my thing. Maybe you should have a re-opening. Hey... On Christmas Eve! -Yeah. -Yeah... Really great idea. I love to party. You are all invited to the opening of Holly's! I really wish you could be there, though. Me too. Aw... Egg-white omelette coming right up. -Hello. -Hello. I just might get a little crazy and throw some sweet peppers in it! Short-order gourmet cook! How do you feel about scallions? Great. Thank you. That phone of yours has no manners. Or timing. What do you mean? Well, just yesterday at the farm, things kind of ended abruptly. What did you expect me to do? Stay in the moment? Yeah, I wish I had that luxury. You know, being tethered to your cell phone, maddie, is a substitute for making a real connection with people. I'm connected to my clients. Okay, I'm just telling you, it was a really special day that we can't reclaim. Just telling you the truth as I see it. Right, the Christmas valley truth. But I live in the real world where making a wreath doesn't come before doing your job. Where does having fun fall on your list of priorities? Okay, you made your point. Look, I'm just saying, maddie, there's an art to slowing down, and sharing Christmas is worthy of your time. You don't even know me. But I'd like to. If she could just ignore her phone. Look, stop reducing me to a stereotype. I worked really hard to get to where I am. Oh, okay, and where is that exactly? A corner office on Madison Avenue. Oh, is that your boss? No, it's my mechanic. Hi, Cory. Yes! I'm on my way. Have a safe trip. Thank you. I mean it. Call me! Again, not eating her omelette. I got good news and I got bad news. What do you mean? Well, the good news is, the alternator got here. Bad news is, it's the wrong one. What am I supposed to do now? Chill, maddie, it'll be okay. No, no, no, "chilling" is not in my nature. I already ordered a new alternator. It should be here by tomorrow... Or the next day. What? Maybe I should just walk to Denver! I'm still in Ohio! I'm never going to make it to the wedding in time! This is not good. Send Irene all the flowers you can find in Denver with my deepest apologies. I'm sure she'll understand. I hope so. If she doesn't, my new office will be in the basement. What should I say to Mr. Warren? Nothing, nothing, nothing yet. I need to figure out what I'm going to say. What are you going to do? Get back to New York as soon as I can. I have to! Christmas is in only two weeks! I need to be at my desk! All right, I'll see you later. Bye. I'm really sorry about your car. Yeah, I think I'm going to go take a walk, I need to figure out my options. Well, bundle up, it's cold out there. You okay? No, I am not. These boots are brand-new, and I didn't even get them on sale! All right, look, let's head back to the farm, and we'll try to rescue them. This coat works in Manhattan, but it is useless in the wilds of Ohio. I will build us a fire, and maybe throw in a little hot chocolate. You had me at the fire. Come on, get in. Come on, rowdy! My car still isn't ready. Yeah, I heard. Yeah, I know. Small town. Buckle up. There you go. Thanks. Where's Jo? Actually, she went over to Pam's looking for you. I really want to see her before I go. Listen, you've, uh, you've made a very big impression on her. I didn't think I had a maternal bone in my body, but... I'm really going to miss her. So... How are my trees doing? Right, you trees. Um, well, they're pretty sturdy stock. Uh-huh. I'll make sure to give them some special attention. And what's happening with the farm? Uh, well, you know, the, um... The flood took its toll. A lot of small farms are going under, but, uh... I think we'll be okay, as long as we get through the end of year. I hope so. This place is so idyllic. I didn't even know places like this actually existed. Are you going a little country? I have more sides than my wardrobe suggests. And I know that. I know. Well, I couldn't tell by your coffee shop critique. Oh. I think it hurt because I know it's true. Christmas, kids, stray dogs, that was never for me. But now I'm not so sure. I'm sorry about the wedding, I am, but I gotta tell you, I'm really glad that you're still here. I have to go back to New York, you live here... I don't want to start something we can't finish... I'm afraid it's already started. I admire your restraint. You're very compelling company. So are you, which... Causes a problem, given my departure. What are you doing here! Hi! I'm waiting for you. Uh, yeah. Wanna go gather some pinecones? Uh, pinecones? Outside? You can wear my rain boots, and my hat, and my scarf. It's so much fun! Uh, it's a kind of Easter-egg hunt, only with pinecones. Hmm... It's a game my mom made up. Then I would be honored. I usually win, but... I'll give you a head start. Okay... Why don't you give us five minutes, Jo, okay? Okay. Thanks, honey. I have ten! I have six! Ooh, I have seven! Oh, this is as much fun as the wreath. I must look ridiculous. No, come on, you look beautiful. I have 12! Good for you! I'm becoming very fond of Christmas. You've got a pretty soft touch, you know. Yeah, well, I'm in danger of losing my edge. In Ohio, no edge is required. I've had a lot of fun today, and I will never look at a pinecone again without wanting to lunge for it. But this is just a... A sweet time-out, this isn't me. Sure about that? Yes. You're working awfully late, can I get you anything? Uh, a new alternator? Cory says it'll be ready by tomorrow. Or the next day. Christmas valley runs a little slower than most places. Yeah, I noticed. If you're in too big a hurry, you might miss it. Okay, I'll bite. Miss what? Whatever it is you really want. Don't work too late. I won't. You back for that omelette, huh? The north pole of the Midwest. It certainly is, wow! Egg-white omelette coming up. Add anything you like. The maddie special! Who's following who, I can't tell anymore. Oh, come on, I was here first. Maybe she's here to see me. Oh, my secret's out. Well, you're gonna have to settle for him. I got some grain to take to market, provided I can find a buyer. I believe in you, Roy. Take care, man. So, listen, maddie, you actually have an invitation from my daughter. I think it involves baking. I have conference call with a client. Right. Maybe I could come by later this afternoon. That would mean a lot to her. Thank you. You know, I have never made a fruitcake before. It's really easy. I don't know, mine is looking a little thin. Hmm... Oh, I see. Secret recipe. Correct. Thank you. For what? My Christmas present, hanging out with me. The gift is getting to be with you. All right... Okay... Mix it up. Whoa! What are you... What's going on here? Maddie and me made fruitcakes. Speak for yourself. I made a door-stop with cherries and pecans. Come on, it can't be that bad. -Oh, yeah. -Here we go, let me try this. Oh, yeah. -Dad? -Yeah? You can't eat a door-stop. Your dad can do almost any... ...he can do anything. This is your fruitcake? Yeah. Do you guys want to try mine? Yes. Mm. Mm... This is the best fruitcake I've ever had in my life. And the best time I ever had in a kitchen. Very good. Everything is more fun when you do it together. Way more fun, and a really great memory. Right. Especially with your dad. -What happened? -You like that? What happened? No, no, no! Uh-oh! Okay, merry Christmas. Look at your face! Come on. Okay, come on. Come on. You certainly have me well-trained, don't you? Good boy. Hello? Oh, okay, I'm on my way. Oh, rowdy... Your alternator came, I've got it installed, and you are ready to go. Thanks. I thought you'd be happy. What's the matter? Who knew Christmas valley would be so tough to leave? Sure is a nice car. It's older than me, and still tearing up the road. I hope you pursue your music. -That's the dream. -Then make it happen. Hey, it's too bad you have to leave. I go caroling every year, and I put this rock 'n' roll spin on Christmas. You know what, put it on a YouTube link and send it to me. You got it. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you, too. What do you got in here? Encyclopedias, and too many shoes. No one around here would have a line like that. No one has that many shoes. It's true, I have a lot of shoes. Thanks again for letting me stay. Oh, my pleasure. I had such a great time. Will you give this present to Jo for me? It's a dress to wear to Holly's party. I just, I hate goodbyes, so it's easier this way. All right, well, I'd better get on the road before it gets dark. Drive safe. Okay, thanks. Thanks again. Bye. ♪ Merry Christmas I'll be coming home soon... ♪ I really thought she and Kevin would get together. Maybe he just needed to be more direct. You think?

I'll take you to one. Come on. Okay, you know what, no, no, hold it. What... really? Yeah, really. I am not some damsel in distress. I understand that, I just always wanted to do this. What, sweep unsuspecting women off their feet? Something like that. You have no idea how much that reindeer cost me. My wreath... That was such a fun day. Well, this one's turning out pretty well. Yeah, except for the bumper and the broken headlight. You can't... you can't have everything. Yeah, I guess you're right. You do that a lot. What? Get things right. I try. Welcome home! Hi! You're just in time for dinner! Um, Bob, um, can you help me with... -I'll get the bags. -Bags. Bob with the bags. Thanks, Bob. So, how long are you staying? I have no idea. What am I going to tell my boss? Tell your boss you tangled with a reindeer. Happens all the time. No, not to new yorkers. Okay, if he doesn't buy that, you know, throw in some weather. Oh, yeah, a really big snow storm. Worst in years. Yeah, that could work. Some snow would really help right now. Well, would you look at that. Okay, not exactly a miracle, but that is spooky. Hmm. Do you have any idea how much that cost me? At least now you don't have to lie to your boss. Yeah. It's amazing. Shall we? So, how long do you think it will take? Well, I ordered a new bumper and headlight. Should only be a day or two. Depends on the weather. Be careful what you wish for. Who wishes for all this snow? A woman who wants to keep her job. You'll be on your way soon enough. I hope so, Christmas is only 12 days away. Funny. A reindeer? I know, I know. You've got to be kidding me. Are you going to be able to get everything done? I'll be back by the end of the week. I'm just glad that you're okay. Mr. Warren wants to talk to you. What's going on? Uh, well, there was, um, a reindeer in the road... An actual reindeer? Yes, and then I ran into a fence, and now I need a new bumper. Can't you just rent a car? There was a snow storm here, and all the roads are closed. I twisted my ankle, it's still... It's pretty swollen. You know what, I'll work from here, and I will be back as soon as I can. Look... Hadley's getting a little antsy, and I can't blame him. I understand. Well, I certainly hope so. Oh. Boy... Your ankle looks okay to me. I needed to be convincing, and the reindeer wasn't playing very well. That quilt is so pretty. It's not just your car that's keeping you here. Okay, I'll admit, I've gotten attached to this place, but I know who I am and where I belong. But you're here right now. Yeah, not by choice. Okay, but while you're here... What? Make every minute count. Hi. How are you? Good to see you. Hey, how you doing? I'm really glad you're still here. We need to talk. Is everything okay? -It's not me. -It's about Kevin. What about him? I've got a friend who works for the bank. They say that Kevin's gonna lose the farm. He said this might happen, but I didn't want to believe it. He thought you'd be gone by now, so maybe you shouldn't say anything. I mean, you know how men can be. Boy has his pride. Well, there has to be something that can be done. The big suppliers are crowding out the smaller farms. Most of us can barely stay afloat. I don't accept that. He and Jo belong on that farm. Hey, I'm on your side. Maybe that reindeer kept you around for a reason. Hey, go a little easy. Remember that pride thing, okay? They can't lose this place. Look, maddie, I know you mean well, and everything, but there's nothing to be done. There has to be something. Don't you think I've tried? I can't bear to think of Jo anywhere else but on this farm. How do you think it makes me feel? Maddie, I couldn't hold back the flood, I can't fight the times here. This is a family farm, and they're a thing of the past. Oh, hey, honey. We'll be okay, wherever we go. Now, this doesn't seem right. Tradition ought to count for something, don't it? Look, you guys, I don't want to be the end of the story here. This farm has been in my family for three generations, four, if you include Jo. All the more reason to keep it going. And I appreciate your good intentions, maddie, I do, I just wish it were enough. Let me tell you something, the Tyler farm grows the most beautiful, most fragrant Christmas trees in the state, and I wouldn't get my tree anywhere else but here. That's good, I can work with that. Work with what? These trees need to be branded. Uh, young lady, these are trees, not cattle... No, no, they need an identity. For a tree? No, not just a tree. The "Tyler Christmas tree "are the best in the state. It's the prettiest, it's the most fragrant..." It's the hardiest, the freshest, they last the longest, okay. I could sell clothing, I could sell accessories, why can't I sell trees? Maddie, most of these tree lots are already filled, so how do you suppose we work around that? By making the Tyler Christmas tree the most popular brand. "The Tyler Christmas tree." Yeah. It's worth a shot. Great. The Tyler Christmas tree just became my number one client. You want to do this? You ready? Mm-hmm. All right, brand me. We're targeting customers... Not just tree lots. Okay, and how do we do that? Well, we can hang a big bow at top of each tree, make it like a gift. A big red bow. Perfect. But the packaging doesn't matter as much as the story. Yes. The trees need a story. Right, so, when you're pitching to tree lots, make it personal. You know, like, "save the Tyler Christmas tree, save the small farmer." It's not just the product, it becomes a cause. A cause we actually care about. Right. We need a label to hang on every tree. Not just the name, something... Something that creates a mood. Okay. What? Well, it's the people, and the things that you do together that really resonates. You know, I never had any of that until I came here. Pinecones, making wreaths... That's what I'll think of when I think of Christmas. Okay, so let me get this straight, you think you can put all of that on one little label? Yeah. It should be a traditional Christmas, like the ones we've always wanted. You know, stockings on the mantle, Jo decorating the tree... I love doing that! Maybe a dog... What do you think, rowdy? If you want a... A dog, better make sure rowdy stays still long enough. I'll shoot it right here. I want it to be totally authentic. What do you say, kiddo? I'm in. Are you in? She's the boss. We're in. Come here. You wanna be in my picture? Oh, wow, the lighting is perfect. Looks great. Okay, maybe... Hang that ornament a little bit higher. Like this? Oh, no, no, don't look at me, honey. I keep forgetting this is pretend. It feels so real. I do this every Christmas. We need some more ornaments on the other side to balance it out. Uh, this one's pretty. Okay. Maybe this one should go... In the front? Uh, yeah. I guess. This is harder than it looks. Didn't you ever trim a tree before? No. Not since I was a little kid. That's really pretty. I usually leave let a set decorator do all this. But this is the best part of Christmas. Do you think we need more candy canes? Maybe on the top. I think I got it. Got what? I got a shot you're never gonna top. That's got to be the label. I've never been a model before. That's not modeling. That's who you are. You're right! That's the one, right? -Mm-hmm. -Come here. You got to see this. That's the prettiest picture I've ever seen. It's great. That is beautiful. But the Tyler Christmas tree is in a class by itself. Yeah. It's a very special tree. The Tyler Christmas tree is the best in the state. Perhaps if you saw it... Okay, well, maybe next year. Okay. Thanks for your time. So? How's it going? Don't ask. We tried every lot in the county, and no takers. They'll come around. We just have to build momentum, get the customers requesting the brand. Mm. -Hey. -What? This is my specialty. Have a little faith. I have faith. Thank you, Jo. All right, fine. What's, uh, what's the plan? I'll start an online campaign, but what we really need is a grassroots movement. But where are we gonna sell the trees, if all the lots have turned us down? We just have to get more creative. Come on! We can do this. Are you sure your boss is okay with all this? Well, he should be. We're selling way more gas than we usually do. Sounds so good. Building buzz, just like you said. You know, for a mechanic, you are some singer. Thanks. ♪ ...making spirits bright ♪ what fun it is to ride ♪ and sing a sleighing song tonight ♪ -Hi! -Hi.

Well, we have real momentum in the local markets, but it's time to hit the big lots. If we start here and zag north, we can hit every lot in the county. Oh, look how tiny Christmas valley is on the map. It's a wonder you found us! There's the fork in the road. If I hadn't veered right, I might not even be here. Maybe it was meant to be. Ah, I don't believe in fate. Fate is what you make of it. Maybe so. We better hit the road. Yes! Only ten more days till Christmas. What are we waiting for? Let's go! All right! Okay. Well... I got to say, it's a really pretty tree. Fragrant, Hardy, admirable needle retention, and lasts longer than most. It took three generations of farmers to grow a tree as perfect as this one. And it's for a good cause. The smaller farms could really use our support. Oh, this one is lovely! It's a Tyler Christmas tree. Best you can buy. Oh! Oh, that's very sweet. Can we get this one? Guess we found our tree. - Okay, great! - Yeah, that's awesome. Okay. You got me. I feel like a traveling salesman. I kind of like it. I like selling something I believe in. It's awesome, with a capital "a." You need to keep this up after I'm gone. Start ramping up for next year. Write some copy, send out some catalogues, maybe start a website. Sounds like a plan. There are a lot of small farmers that could use a good rep. You could make a steady living and really do some good. You know... What you do about Pam is up to you, but I think it's time you made a move. I'm just saying. "I'm just sayin'..." What about you and Kevin? Hey, roz. Yeah? So what do you want me to do? Send me the numbers. Go ahead and schedule the presentation. I'll be home in a couple of days. ♪ red-nosed ♪ walking in the falling snow ♪ lights guide the way thank you.

It's too bad you have to leave so early. I think you'd have a really good time. I'm sure I would. I'd like to buy a Christmas tree. Yes, ma'am. I'll be right over. I'll call you when the car's done. It's been a sweet ride. You know, that gets prettier and prettier every day. It's nearly done. I'm really gonna miss this place. We'll miss you. You've made quite a difference in your short stay. Ohh... Hello? Mr. Warren would like to know when you will be here. Let me talk to her. Here you are, sir. You have to deliver that presentation so Hadley can approve it. Yes, I've done all the research and all the prep. Exactly when are you coming back? In a couple of days. Look, the weather has cleared up. What's the delay? It's my ankle. It's still... It's still pretty swollen. I'd rather leave on Sunday and beat all the traffic. I want you at your desk first thing next week. Understood? Absolutely. I will be there. I promise. Thank you, sir. Bye. You've been traipsing all over Ohio with that very same ankle. Well, I... I want to go caroling with Cory and hear him sing, and want to spend a little more time with Jo. It's only one more day. Mm. And then there's Kevin... Yeah. I like him. A lot. But I have to go home. He and I are just friends, and I need to accept that. You can't control how you feel. I can try, for his sake and for mine.

Maddie, look. You matter to me, you matter to my daughter. My life is in New York! My job, my apartment. This has been a wonderful uncharted detour, but it isn't real. Maddie, this is as real as it gets. And maybe that is what scares you. I don't want this night to end badly, so I think we should say good night. Okay. I'm gonna miss my number-one customer.

Um, first, a meeting with Warren, to discuss the presentation, then lunch with the client. You okay? Yeah, it's just a big transition. I'm still running on Ohio time. Want me to cancel anything? I can't. Christmas is five days away, and I have all those sales to promote, then the after- Christmas sales. And so it goes... On and on. Big seasonal push every year. You know, it really takes all the joy out of Christmas. Listen to you! Christmas valley really gets to you. You miss it? I miss who I was when I was there. Maddie Duncan's office. Yes, sir. I'll let her know. Your meeting with Warren has been bumped to 10:00. Hmm. Still lost in Ohio? Yeah, I guess. You know I don't believe in fate, but getting that wedding invitation, then the trees on the highway, then that fork in the road... What if I had gone the other way? It really makes you think it was meant to be. Yeah, it does. Hey, honey. What's wrong? I miss maddie. I know you do, sweetheart. I miss her, too. Well, did you tell her that? Uh... Yeah, I tried to. Hey. I want to send her a Christmas present. Okay. What? I don't know what. She has enough clothes and stuff. Mm-hmm. I just really don't want her to forget us. I have a great idea. Let's remind her. Grab your cones. I'm about to give my presentation. I'm thinking fewer graphs and more motivational. Roz? What is that? Somebody sent you a present. It's from Christmas valley, and I was told to deliver it personally. From who? I believe she said her name was Jo. You haven't even opened it! The thought is enough. She seems like a really sweet kid. She is. With a really wonderful father. Kevin? Jo mentioned him. Apparently... He misses you, and she thought I should know, in case I have any sway. Tsk! Oh! Uh, as pinecones go, it's very nice, but I'm not sure it warrants all the emotion. What is that? A door-stop. I guess you had to be there. No wonder you miss Ohio. Maddie Duncan's office. Yes, sir, I'll tell her. They're ready for you in the conference room. Tell him I'll be right there. Okay. Good morning. Good morning. How are you? Ahem. So... Let's just get right to it, shall we? Christmas is only four days away... But retailers should keep their ad campaigns in high gear until the end of the year because buying doesn't fall off a cliff after Christmas. Right? Shoppers are waiting, credit cards poised... Uh... Ahem. Fourth-quarter numbers are breaking records this year, both-both online and in the brick-and-mortar malls. This shouldn't be what Christmas is about. Maddie? Are you okay? No, sir. I'm-I'm not. What seems to be the problem? I'm sorry, but I don't belong here. Um... ahem. What do you mean? I belong in Christmas valley, Ohio. Is this part of the presentation? Um... apparently not. It's not about where you are, it's about the people, and who you love, that make a place a home. You're going back to Ohio? Yeah. And, if I hurry, I can get there before Christmas. Sorry! You look very pretty. I feel kind of funny. After you, miss. Hi! Shh... Hi. Maddie! Hi!
