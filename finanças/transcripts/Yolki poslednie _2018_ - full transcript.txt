THE RUSSIAN CINEMA FUND with the support of THE RUSSIAN CINEMA FUND BAZELEVS SBERBANK presents U TV Channel STS TV Channel ODNOKLASSNIKI recommends Miss, I'm begging you, please stop the car or we'll crash! Galya, honey, slow down! Please! This is kidnapping, Article 126. You get 5 to 12 years for that. Vera dear, buckle up! Have you driven a car before?! Of course I have. Three times in a simulator and Dad taught me when I was little. This is just great. My last New Year's Eve... Vera, hold on tight! We need you! YOLKI: THE FINAL COUNTDOWN In the days before New Year everyone needs to have faith. You can't get by without faith in a country like ours. To survive, we need to believe in miracles, in the kindness of Grandfather Frost, and in ourselves. We need to be decisive... but that can be easier said than done. Galya, do we really need a new TV? Just imagine: we're at the table. You open and pour the champagne. Bubbles are rising, the countdown is on, but there's no sound on the TV. - And? - How will we count down? We've done the counting for you! Quiet! If you wake the baby we won't buy anything. We've done the counting... A new ultra thin 65-inch TV... It's difficult enough to choose the right size TV, but it's far more difficult to forgive a close person who has deeply hurt you in the past. Son, if you don't drop by to see me again, I will transfer you some money as a gift. Happy New Year, Denis! Forgive me for... For everything. Denis, you should make peace with him. I feel bad for him. Did he feel bad for me when he left? Well, he only left once. Long ago. Stop being so stubborn, let's drop by. It's New Year's Eve. - I don't want to see him. - One day, you won't be able to. He'll be fine. How beautiful... her voice is. She has a gift... of persuasion. I'd love to... ...hear her sing live. Too bad she doesn't have a song about fathers and sons, right Denis? That'd be one for you. Let me show you our new meat grinder? Tonight, let's all put our old grudges behind us. See you on New Year's Eve. He'd listen to her. Your transfer bounced back again, sorry. Again? Are you just milking me for commissions? Who's the manager here? Let's find your mom... There she is! Look how pretty she looks in her uniform... ...I've been around much longer than you have. I worked hard all my life! I worked for your future even before you were born! And all I get is "sorry" and a smile? - Have a good day. - Have a good day. - What's wrong with him? - He's just a lonely old man. His son doesn't want anything to do with him. Evgeny, you forgot your passport! He's already gone? - Take it to him. - He'll come back for it. Let me see his passport, his address should be there. - Oh, that's a short walk from here. - But you have the kids. Fresh air is good for them, they'll sleep better. Friendship is a marvelous thing. We raise our kids together, help each other as much as we can, and share our deepest thoughts. Friendship means standing shoulder to shoulder while moving mountains or saving the world. But only being silly together, at least once a year, is a sure sign of true closeness. - Want some goulash? - I don't like goulash. I'll have kharcho. Sorry bro, I waited until the very last moment to tell you... But you know me, when I tell you things I say it all, I spill it all out. - Ready? - Ready. So... I'm moving back to Yakutia. Today. For good. I'm not coming back. There's a state program where anyone can get a hectare of land for free. Everyone in my family got one, and now we have a huge plot of land. I'll use the relocation allowance to open a wild animal zoo. There are so many wild animals in Yakutia, herds of them! We also get grants... This is Russia! Do you love Russia? Of course. So do I, and so does my family. For us, Russia is just... It's so big and great and wonderful. It's my country, and I just... Leaving tonight. I fly business class, the in-laws fly economy. At 11:20 p.m. New Year's Eve on a plane? They have crazy discounts if you fly on New Year's Eve. And there's ten of us. - Ten? - Alright, seven. Buddy, are you okay? You turned pale all of a sudden. Who, me? Well, that's because I'm very happy for my best friend. - Here's my kharcho. - Kharcho makes you groucho, haha. A friend is one soul that lives in two bodies. When a friend leaves it feels like a soul leaving a body. But when a friend appears, or rather arrives... ...you want to believe it's for good. "...the train leaves in five minutes." Your town is so pretty, I want to stay here. - Miss, please hurry, my train is leaving. - Sir, I need to get this machine working. Thanks. It's you. It's me. And you are..? - I watched all the seasons. - Really? In the last episode you got killed. Will you survive or is that it? You have amazing eyes. - I have contacts on. - I could get lost in them. Colored contacts. Your train is about to leave. So I'll just stay. I want the fanciest drink you have. Long latte island iced tea please. No one will watch the show if you're not in it! Wait. I can't leave without you. Come with me. I can't leave just like that. I need to turn off the coffee machine and clean it... I'll find you. What's your number? - Will you memorize it? - Of course I will. I'm an actor. - 8... Got it? - 8... - 916... - 916... - 315... - 315... - 79... - 79... - 61. - 61. Got it! - See you, Ginger! - 41... - 41! - Me too! I'm such an idiot... Ira from Voronezh knew that happiness never waits for those who seek it. As for our old friend Grigory from Perm, every time he was faced with happiness, he just panicked... - You were right. She's cool. - Duck before she sees us! ...and backed away from it. What's the problem? Go and invite her out. Just say, "Come with me to a private New Year party tonight. Invitation-only, at a ski resort." She'll say yes, I'm telling you. I can't. Just say three words: "I like you." What's her name? I don't know. - Dude, her name is on her badge. - I don't dare to look at her chest. Then say, "Let's ring in the New Year together" and that's it, you win. Every time I start telling her about myself that lady shows up... ...and puts an end to it. You can't chat with cashiers. Why do you tell her about yourself? To let us get to know each other, to test the waters... Testing is for nerds. Let's go. Act bold and don't be a slowpoke. They say, a cheeky person owns half the world, but they don't say who owns the other half. Our student Andrey, who came to spend the holidays with his mom, had no dreams of world domination. He just wanted his mom to be happy. Enough, Mom. Leave some for Uncle Yuri. That was his dream. Uncle Yuri doesn't need any. It's all for you. I'll have some too. When's he coming back? What makes you think he's coming back? He might not. Of course he will. I can see his antlers are still hanging on the wall. Sure, he's got to get his antlers back. Stop looking at me like that. Here, call him if you want. - Hello? - Hi, Uncle Yuri. Where are you? Where am I? In my nest. So where is he? There's a tradition among Russian men to leave the house on December 31st of each year. Some go to the sauna with friends, some go to get a Christmas tree... And some never come back. Uncle Yuri! Andrey really loved his mom. He didn't love the silly traditions much. ...I'd build a crystal palace for her... ...Silver streams to please her ears, and golden dunes to please her eyes. Silver streams to please her ears... Uncle Yuri! Andrey, my boy! You found me... Wanna play hockey? No puck though... We can make one out of stale bread: add some saliva and shape it... - Why are you torturing my mom? - I'm not torturing anyone. I'm in pain. Where does it hurt? My soul, Andrey. My soul. You don't know what heartbreak is. And golden dunes... I don't care. Mom wants you to come and get your stuff. I'm too busy. I'm building a house. Once I've built this house... ...I will come to your mother. Wearing my service coat and a tie. I'll do it the right way. At this pace... Suppliers let me down, the bastards. I wanted to finish building this cottage by the first snow. They let me down. But there's still time until New Year's Eve. On New Year's Eve, my boy, we'll be in our new house. I'll plant lily-of-the-valleys and white tulips by the porch for your mom... - New Year's Eve is today. - Yeah, time flies... What do you mean, come and get my stuff? Ah, no! We'll go to her, but I need to be fully ready! ...Here my darlings, have some canapes with ham. Enjoy. This is for your mom... Son, pour the champagne, will you? Well, let's bid the old year goodbye. I'm so glad you came to visit. You made this old man very happy. Wait, I have a toast to make. Here's to Denis, my son. Cheers, son. Hello. Are you Evgeny? - How did you get in? - The door was unlocked. You made a copy of my key? What? You left your passport at the bank. Here it is. Ah, is that a new service? Passport delivery? - No idea. I don't work at the bank. - Where do you work then? They talked about your type on TV. You already got yourself a mortgage in my name, didn't you? - You're welcome. We'll get going. - Freeze! You wanted to trick me into trusting you, am I right? I'll call the police on you, dial 02 and tell them who you are. - The number to call is 112 now... - You would know! You're a thief! Let me see your passport! What's your last name? This is ridiculous. I'm Zavialova. Zavialova? - And your name is..? - Marina. Marina honey... Do you still live with your mom? - No, I have my own place. - Of course, you're all grown up now... Why didn't Nina come to see me? - I don't know. - Your kids are so cute... They both look just like Nina. Come on, take your jacket off, and undress the kids before they get sweaty. - We kind of need to go home now... - No, that's out of the question! It's so sweet of you to come by! What a pleasant surprise! I even have the table set out! Come on in, come on in. Here she comes! Mom, there's no way I can come over today. My schedule is absolutely crazy. I'll call you when I'm done, ok? Clear the way! Let the celebrity through! - Vera, excuse me, this is for you. - Who is it? My husband Denis. Please tell him to make peace with his dad today. "The subscriber is not available." Happy holidays. Let's go and see him then. - See who? - The subscriber. It's not far. How about next time I'm in Nizhny Novgorod, which will be in May, you and I will go and see him. Deal? Deal. Hey, my friend? Did you lose something, my friend? Yes I did. I lost my friend. Evgeny! Evgeny! Let me give you a ride home. No need, Boris. My unlimited transport pass is still good today. Hi, you're going to get a call from a man... Your number ends with 61, and mine with 41. He'll be calling me, not you. Please tell him... No, don't tell him anything, just give him my number. What the hell?! Are you stupid?! Or are you crazy?! - Calm down. - What the hell?! - This is an emergency... - An emergency? This is ridiculous! Let me in! I need to get to Michurinsk. Please. ...He's an absolutely fantastic actor. Different in every role. Did you watch the show where he plays a doctor? He's a genius. In this one scene, his friends offer him the money he needs... And he's like, "No brothers, I can't," crying tears of joy... Just incredible. I don't watch movies. At all? I like music. All actors are... you know. What? Well, either you-know-what or they have multiple wives. He's not married. Then he's the other kind for sure. My intuition tells me. Stop the car. I won't ride with a person who doesn't understand me. You want me to leave you here in the middle of nowhere? Stop the car. You and I are from different planets. I was born to... And what were you born to do? To hold the steering wheel. Any robot can do your job. - I don't work as a driver! - Stop the car... - Don't touch anything! Calm down! - I said, stop the car or I will... What are you doing?! We've arrived. You happy now? Your order will be ready in a few minutes. Hi, may I take your order? Do you ski? Hi, hello... Where might I find the complaints and suggestions book? Why, do you have a complaint? No, a suggestion for now. I've been working here since 2012, and there's not been a single complaint or suggestion. Wait! You... There's never a free table to sit at! I suggest you do reservations. I love to ski, but recently I've been busy with other things... Or do you snowboard? Say I want to celebrate my 25th birthday here - or yours... ...also 25th. No tables means the party's ruined. I would've been a pro athlete if I wasn't a sickly child... How about a New Year's Eve menu? Tangerines, champagne, sparklers? Do you like cinema? How about a late-night delivery? Russian or not... People get really hungry late at night! I like it when persimmons are astringent... Yes Mom, we'll be back soon. Go away! Uncle Yuri, will you be much longer? Gotta protect your head. Hurry up, you mom's waiting. I'm about to throw up... No, no. As they say, if you draw a gun you have to shoot it. Don't complain. You should've had a pee in the forest. Well? What is it now? Relax, Uncle Yuri, we'll manage without a Christmas tree... It's not about a Christmas tree. Or any tree. You're too young to understand these things. It's about feelings... But you're adults, I thought you've already done the deed and all... How dare you think that about your mother?! "Done the deed"... How dare you?! What's the problem then? You don't want to marry her? You have no ring? - Who has no ring? - You. Who has no ring? The ring I got you could take to Mordor, but that's not the point. I can't propose just like that, out of the blue, and say something random, just for the sake of it. Your mom will be shocked, so I must know exactly, word for word, what I will say. - Help me. - How? I need to practice my speech. Let's rehearse it. Pretend to be her, and I'll pretend to be him... To be me. She's standing by the stove cooking, and I'm sitting at the kitchen table. I get up and creep up behind her. Wait, why would I creep up behind her? What am I, a creep? Or an idiot? Why not just call out to her, "Tanya!" Yes, better to call out to her. Tanya! Sit down, Yuri, and let's eat. The food's getting cold. And I sit down, right? Right. Tanya, you and I aren't young anymore... No, that's a horrible thing to say. It's like me saying that she's old. Like implying that young people can have kids and she can't. I should bite my tongue. Bite it. Right here. Let it hurt when I lick something. Don't look so disgusted. You've just ruined my mood. Go back to the stove. I'll start from the middle. And... Tanya! Tanya... You've grown on me. You're like a part of me now. For me, you are one, my love... Like the moon in the dark sky above... Tanya... Marry me. Be my wife. I do... - Hello. - Hi. Hello... - Happy holidays. - Thank you. Watch your step, sweetie... - Right. I'll just go with the flow. Ugh! - Jeez, man! Let's run five laps around the building real quick. Why are you so on edge? - Can't you push any harder? - I can't! It's slippery here! Come on, come on, come on... Hitch yourself a ride. I'm staying here. - I tried, no one's stopping. - Sure, you weren't born to hitchhike... I can do everything if I need to, but you'll never now. Thank God for that! Listen, Snow White, be proactive. Unbutton your jacket. Fluff up your hair and stare in the distance as if you have no worries. Got that? And open your neck. - I'm cold. - Five minutes won't kill you. Not bad. Thanks for the advice, and... Driving is a good job too. - Driving is not my job. - I got that. Still, you're a nice guy. Bye. - Hello. - Hey there. - Going to Michurinsk. - Jump in, curly locks. Thanks. Wait! I need to go there too. I'll get in first. My stop is closer than hers. "...I'm not homeless, can't you see that?" "I'm just unfortunate." "As if an unfortunate person can't be homeless..." Where does her dad work? He's an actor. Actors get paid so little these days... Or is he a film actor? No, he works in a children's theater. That's fine, as long as you live in peace... and not like my son and I. It's been so many years already... And I'm his father, not a stranger. Remember I brought Denis a toy train set from Moscow? You really liked it as well. Of course I remember. So tell me now, was it you who took one of the track pieces? Honestly? Yes. You were such a cheeky monkey! I have some photos of you when you were little. Evgeny, your phone is ringing! Evgeny, why didn't you come for your appointment yesterday? With a cardiogram like yours... - Hello. Evgeny stepped out. - Who am I talking to? Umm... I'm his niece Marina. Why don't you care for the old man, Marina? He is so miserable and lonely he's aged a decade in one year. You can't treat family like that. This New Year's Eve could well be his last. They haven't talked in 20 years. His father tries to contact him but Denis flat out refuses. You're my only hope, Vera... Look ahead! We went shopping for a new TV and Denis saw you on the screen, and... Have you driven a car before?! Of course I have. Three times in a simulator and Dad taught me when I was little. - Galya, honey, please slow down! - "Honey?" - That's my dad. I'll introduce you later... - Dad, help! Hold on tight Vera, I'm about to overtake that car! You don't overtake on the right! This is outrageous, Galya! Your dad is absolutely right. This is an outrage! No this isn't. My husband's hospital salary is an outrage. Sure, it's totally safe to take that call... - Hello, Denis? - Hey, can you buy a can of peas? Sure thing. Denis, I have somebody here who really wants to talk to you. Who would that be? Vera Brezhneva? The battery died. No luck this time. Sticking to plan B then. Galya, don't do it. This is kidnapping, Article 126. You get 5 to 12 years for that. Dad, there's no other way. They won't make peace. Forget it and think about yourself. There they are! Dad, when you left Mom and I for three years and didn't call or write... Galya, now is not the time. Why not? Mom gave you a second chance, didn't she? Denis' dad deserves one too. Help! "Second chance," you say? Here's your second chance. What the hell was that, huh?! Sorry, brakes failed. Thanks, Dad. The light of distant planets shines on us, or we might be just dreaming. You'll see the day begin in neon colors, and this is just the beginning. Look at me, and remember how we soared together above the clouds... Wow... Girl, you got incredibly lucky, I tell you that. I've been driving this truck for years, and the only celebrity I've met was our local politician, not even worth mentioning his name. And you - bam! Met Komarovsky himself. That's fantastic. I have all of his films on CDs, look behind you. I just don't know how it's possible not to love him. - I agree. - Do you? - Oh yeah. - Remember his signature line? - His trademark? - Yes. "Think about it philosophically." Yeah, what a great line... I'm glad we met, by the way. Turn the volume down, I can't hear anything over this. Can't you drive faster? Send me a picture of his autograph, I'll leave you my number. Sure. Or give me your number, I'll call. How about I give you my number? It's 112. I'll be waiting. What the... - Buddy... - Watch the road. You think she's that easy to get? Think again. What? You happy now? I saved your life! I watched a film where a trucker strangled hitchhikers, same story. - What story? - That trucker was... into young girls. I'm 24 years old. For those kind of people, the older the victim the better. Are you cold? No. When I was doing military service we did this exercise to get warm... Pasta and chicken. Pasta and chicken. Come on, repeat after me. Pasta and chicken. That's a ridiculous exercise. And why not "chicken and pasta"? I did my service in St. Petersburg. That's what they say there. Putin as well? Let's get going. - Oh hi Tanya... - Hi. Hi. Mmm, the kitchen aromas... Such amazing aromas... Aromas... - Aromas... How've you been? - Fine. Would you like some borsch? - Mom... - Shut up. - Uncle Yuri... - Zip it. - Uncle Yuri wants to tell you something. - Zip it... Yes. Tanya... Borsch sounds great. I'd love to have some borsch right about now. Borsch it is then. So yeah... And then on October 1 we get a letter from him. "I turned 28, too old for draft, so you can kiss my big fat aft." Tanya, I want to ask you a question. Have you seen a small puck from my table hockey set anywhere? Maybe when you were vacuuming? No. Uncle Yuri... Right, it can't be here because the hockey set is at my place. I have a domino set with me. Come on, let's play some bones. Alright then. - Do you see him? - No. That means he doesn't smoke. That's good. That means we'll have healthy kids. Eldar?! Listen, I have a plan. We need to take off our jackets. Miss, you've got to let us in. We're from carriage No.6. We just had to buy more pies from an old lady, they're delish! - Carriage No.6 is the diner. - My bad, we're from No.7. We left our tickets in our compartment, honest. That was a cheeky move! Happy holidays everyone... But we made it in. Start looking for him, on side berths too. Are you crazy? He's a star. We're surrounded. Get a room. There are kids and old people on the train. I saw that trick in one of Eldar's films, he used it to hide from cops. Got it. We could've just hid in the diner. True. He could be there. ...These were taken in 1989 when I took Denis with me to the sea. And these... Evgeny, we should be leaving. Wait, I have some photos of your mom Nina when she was young. Evgeny, I could take some of your wonderful dolmas to Denis. Well, alright. Sure. You're so sweet, and your idea is simply wonderful. Wait. Could you also take some money to Denis? I'm tired of those bank people. All they do is smile and say "sorry". I'll be right back. Here's my Jules Verne... - What's Denis' address these days? - Are you joking? Did you forget? I did. He moved back into his late grandma's apartment a year ago. Ah, that's right! I got mixed up... Your grandma helped him move. Goodness me... I forgot... What's your grandma's name? It's ok if you don't remember it. What's important is, we remember you. I'll go now, I've got a delivery to make. What's your dad's name? Please forgive me. My name really is Marina Zavialova, but my mom's name is Olga. I came here, saw you, the names matched, I got confused... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. When Denis was in the third grade his dad left the family. Right on New Year's Eve. And they haven't talked in 20 years. His dad's been trying to get in touch, but Denis rejects him. Hi everyone. Today I met a person named Evgeny. A lonely old man. His only son hasn't written or called him in 20 years. He sits alone in his apartment, it's New Year's Eve and he has no one to even talk to. Does anyone here know him? His son's name is Denis Prokhorov, he lives here in Nizhny Novgorod. I'll check for him on Leninsky St. Natasha, can you do Kanavinsky? Let's maybe check listings district by district and find Evgeny's son. Remember how quickly we found Luda's husband? Yulia, don't cry... "Yes, let's do this!" "Marina, I'm in!" "So sad :( Calling Dad now." "I want to help" "That's unrealistic! Trust me!" "Sure, you found yourself a mom, you can relax now!" "Delete this comment?" - Hey. - Hey. - Why did you delete my comment? - What comment? I didn't delete any. The whole country helped you find a mom, but you don't want to help anyone. Actually I do help people. That's a lie. "I'm in!" Look, it's the hospital where we almost spent New Year's Eve that one time. I don't remember that. I wasn't even talking to you. I was just reminiscing. And this is where I found your penguin! Right here! And before that, you stole it. I borrowed and then returned it. You're so selfish. Wait... Oww... Oh, I don't feel good. Maybe it's the kharcho? Did you hear the story today about the son and dad who fell out of touch? No contact for 20 years. Who knows, maybe I'll never hear from you again. Listen, what if you and I are actually real brothers? What? Just recently two babies left the maternity home with the wrong mothers, and then got compensation. What if that happened to us? How much? - How much what? - The compensation. A million. Rubles, of course. We can't be brothers. Just look at you: a dodgy character... with dark hair. My family are typical Finno-Ugrians. Pedigree, no less. Look at you... and then look at me, a normal person. He's not here. He's going to get hungry sooner or later. Have a seat. Wow, 250 rubles for a beer. I feel like we were made for each other. Should I say that to him? Sounds a bit too direct. ...How about a karaoke then? "On my way to a Gucci shop..." Dude, we're all waiting. So what I'm saying is... "...Gotta make a burger stop. Burger!" ...If all of your friends are busy and you have no plans for tonight... - Your buddy again? - I don't even know him. I see. Off to the Drive-Thru you go. May I take your order? Dude, if words don't work you have to amaze her with some action. You have any cool skills? Well, I can ski... Sure, but do you see any mountains here? Anything else? There's something else, but I need music for that. One moment. Come on, man! Wait for him to finish! Endorphins, let's go. Imagination, let's go. - Well... - My favorite song. - What's going on? Get out of the way! - Give us a moment! Happy holidays, man! Escaping from justice again? No, just some cops... How was it? One hundred percent cool. Now ask her out. Come on. Listen, I understand what it's all about. You have 30 seconds. Say whatever you want to say, and please don't come back until this shift is over. Ok, thanks... You wanted to tell me something? Can I get a milkshake please? If we're not brothers, why does destiny always bring us together? - We have collisions. Once a year. - Every year, on December 31. It's some kind of a New Year's curse. You're my karmic tangerine. This tangerine wants some privacy. - We're like a canape. I'm the topping. - A slice of stale cheese. - Like meat aspic with horseradish. - You're the horse. In the good sense of the word. Although... You can't walk away from an animal. Just look at it. "Help me, Evgeny." We have to save its life. You took the Hippocratic Oath, didn't you? That's only for people. You tell this cat your stupid oath doesn't apply to it. Oh God, she's got poliomyelitis. I'll go put her on a drip. I have all the meds at home. Game over. This was a good one. W is for "winner", P is for "pro". Who's the winner? I am. Who's the pro? I am. Uncle Yuri, are you sure that in your case W stands for "winner"? Of course I am. Of course I'm the winner, with a 12:0 score. I'm talking about my mom. You're talking about your mom. What are you talking about? I can't just show up and say, "Marry me and let's go to bed." That would be ill-mannered. Let her get used to me being here. She hasn't had a man in years. - You know what? - What? Your excuses are lame. Do you even have a ring? - Shut up. - Where is it? - Shut up and sit back down. - Where is it? - Get back in here, you little brat. - A box of your stuff... Is it in here? Put it back where you found it! Let's look for the ring... Is it maybe in this bag? - Don't touch my map case. - Secret pockets... Put my map case back in the box! That's my combat radio, you idiot. You have no idea where it's been... - Hands off my photo album! - "Paratroopers for life." Don't touch my flippers. - There is no ring! You're a liar! - Don't you dare talk to me like that! - Go and propose without a ring, now! - Don't you tell me what to do, punk! - Coward! - "The ring, the ring..." - Windbag! - That's it... Stop it, you two! What's all this? Stop it! I said stop it now! So I don't have a ring! No ring, no nothing! I don't have anything to offer you! All I have is this box full of useless junk. Tell me now, do you need me the way I am? Do you? Tell him you do, Mom! If you do, take me as I am. I will love you and... Go away. - What? - I said go away. - Go where? - Wherever you came from. Ah, in that sense... - Yuri... - Yes? Don't forget to take your antlers. All too familiar. Been there before. Uncle Yuri, where are you going? - Mom, what's wrong with you? - Let him go. You're behaving like children! That's it. He's gone. He and I have a lot in common. We're both single, we're both... ...single. I always thought of myself as a nobody. Somebody unimportant. "Here's your coffee, enjoy." But he noticed me. The way he looked at me... And then he left. Can't I get lucky for once in my life? - Well... - Do I deserve a miracle? Cheer up. We'll find your guy. Come on, let's go. Come on. "Denis Prokhorov" "Country: Russia City: Nizhny Novgorod" "Yo Denis, remember your dad?" "Hey four-eyes... Hey Denis, call your dad already." "Denis, do you even care where your dad is now? Call me, I'll tell you." "Hey fisherman, caught your dad yet?" "My dad's at home, why?" "How did you find me?" So, what did you want? - Are you Denis Prokhorov? - That's me. You must talk to your dad. - Dad, somebody here says... - Sorry, my mistake. Why are your parents not watching you? Who's going to explain to my boy that his dad isn't in trouble? I'm really sorry, my mistake. Happy holidays. You little b... Wrong one again. Enough of this. This cat will outlive you now. Just kidding. You'll live about the same. While I was holding the drip I realized something. You should go home. We Russians are all one big family. Olga, how about you guys stay? Just don't go. - You can live with us if you like. - Yeah, thanks. Boris, wait! Let me look at you. How you've grown! And so have you... little boy. Die, Uncle Boris! He's kidding. You can live. Right, this is it. Who wraps their luggage like that? This is ridiculous. My kid would do a better job at it than you. Right, let's take the wrap off and re-wrap everything under my direct supervision. Trust me, I'm a professional. Last one on the list... - Hello? - Hi, are you Denis Prokhorov? Yes. Cool. Please see your father tonight. He misses you and... I don't have a father. I'm an orphan. I was left at the lost-and-found counter in a train station, got that? That's him. Told you he'd be in first class. What do we do? What do you think? Go to him. I can't. What would I say to him? You don't need to say anything. He's already said it all. Your eyes, beautiful. Your brows, expressive. Your hair... And your laugh is contagious. He didn't say that. He should've. He'll say it soon. And... remember that you're the prettiest of all. Go. No, I can't! Even if it means I'll be single for life - that's fine. Let's leave. Gosh, can't you do anything without my help? Hello. Good evening. Remember this girl? You flirted with her when you were buying coffee. - Of course I remember her. - Accept the delivery then. - I'm lost for words. - Have a seat, Ira. Can we have a word outside? - Where? - We'll be quick. Alright then. Promise to treat her with respect. She's different from all those... I understand... I hope you're not the "wham bam thank you ma'am" kind of guy. That's not who I am. Cool. Well, I'll leave you to it now. I gave you the wrong phone number. Mine ends with 41. I texted and called, couldn't figure out what's wrong. Let's celebrate the occasion. ...Dreaming of making you mine. So what if I stole you away? It's a fair game, not a crime... Vera, I'm really sorry about all of this. You wouldn't do it otherwise, and it's really important that they make up. It's ok, I understand. - You're cool. - So are you. Tell Denis that as well. - Are you not mad at me anymore? - No, but I'm thirsty. You are? Let's get you something to drink then. I'm thirsty too. I'll be right back. Room temperature, right? - Yes, and not fizzy. - Got it. I don't see any indications for a cardiogram, but if you insist I can give you a referral for it. Enough of the small talk. I wouldn't trust you with my heart anyway. Your own heart must be in the wrong place if you don't care about your dad. Maria, with all due respect, I'm the doctor here. You don't have to forgive him, just call him and say you love him. It's New Year's Eve and he's all alone. If you just want to chat with someone why don't you call him yourself? - Granny Manya, season's greetings! - My dear boys... - We have a small present for you. - Oh thank you! Sorry, we can't drop by today, all because of this slowpoke here. - Who's the slowpoke? - Who's been slow all day? - Well, should I give you a referral? - No need. I feel better now. - You should be doing this yourself. - I know, but when I see her I freeze up! Alright, stop panicking. I'll do this for you, bro. Thanks. Tell her I want to walk her home... Yes, yes... - ...And to spend New Year's Eve with her. - Yes, yes, and your wedding day. In dining cars, I always think of Alexander Blok's poetry. So do I. Always. At evening time above the restaurants There hangs a fetid muffled cloud, With cries of rowdy drunk belligerence Holds sway the vernal rotten crowd. Good evening. Hello. A bottle of champagne please. What would you like to eat? My treat. Sorry, we're out of champagne. You're out of champagne. I have a bottle in my room, I'll go get it. Wait for me a few moments, ok? I'd wait a lifetime. Mom... He honestly wanted to propose to you, but he lost the ring. He didn't lose it. He hid it in a salt shaker a year ago... ...and it's still there. Look in the china cabinet. Come on, Uncle Yuri... What a coward. Look who's here! My baby had a good walk with Auntie Marina? - What happened? - Nothing. - Is it about the kids? - No, everything's fine, really. Guys, where's the arugula? You unpacked the groceries. Oh... Marina, take your jacket off and come on in. I brought a high chair for Yulia. What's he doing here? - We met in the store by chance. - Oh really? How sweet. I read a lot about one-year-olds, I know everything now. You've got to talk to them a lot. I can start right now. Did you break up with Tanya? Marina, give me a chance. Today's a special day. Let's start with a clean slate. "Here's Denis' address:" We've got to let them know we understand them without words. Yulia, keep an eye on my Yulia. I'll be back soon. Marina... I saw you trying to convince him. Don't force him if he's not sure. I won't survive the fourth divorce. - What fourth divorce? - I said I won't survive it. He's almost done building a house for you. Yeah right. I saw it with my own eyes... But the materials suppliers let him down. He's living there, and he's doing it all just for you. Come, I'll show you. I'm not going anywhere. - Mom, go get dressed. - No. You're like children, I swear! "He loves me, he loves me not..." I'll go there myself then! There she is! There was a tall guy with her, too. - What? - We need to see your ticket please. I'm here with Eldar. He's a very famous actor, very handsome... He'll be here soon. You don't understand! I told you I'm with Eldar, he bought me a ticket! Miss, calm down. You're not on the list of registered passengers. You can write a complaint and it will be reviewed in due course. Close the door... What "due course"? You're going to regret this! - Well? - It all worked out. But not exactly. - Wait, did she agree to go? - Yes, yes... ...but with me. What do you mean? Are you serious? It all happened spontaneously, I can't even explain... Let's go? Here, that's for you, from her. I'm off. Keep your chin up! Don't sit here too long. Eldar? Eldar? - Do you like poetry? - Eldar? Eldar? Tell them to open the door! - Hello, Miss. - They think I don't have a ticket! At evening time above the restaurants There hangs a fetid muffled cloud... Vera, they didn't have the non-fizzy kind, but it's room temp... Oh. Boris... Boris, it's okay. - No, we'll do this! - There, there... It's all good. It's all good. Boris... Do you think it was easy for me to make the decision to leave? But if you're my friend... set me free. I have a present for you. - Hi, are you Denis Prokhorov? - Yes, and you are..? My name is Marina Zavialova. Your dad is really miserable. That's very good. What do you mean? I'm glad he's miserable. That means there's some justice in life. You seem to not realize that he really is very lonely. Please wait. Today is such a special day... You can make a brand new start. He wants to see you so badly. He has a table set up. He made dolma, your favorite dish. There's homemade wine. Why don't you go and see him? I don't drink. He's your dad. Why is the snow so cruel that it shows your tracks on my trail? The circle is now full, but you're running from me again. Melting snow drips down below, and it's keeping me up at night. There's one thing you should know: my love for you feels right. Melting snow drips down below, and it's keeping me up at night. There's one thing you should know: my love for you feels right. Thanks everyone for all your help. I talked to Denis... ...but it didn't help. I think I only made things worse. He doesn't want to talk to his dad. He must've been hurt, I don't know. Wouldn't it be wonderful if no one ever felt lonely? If at least on New Year's Eve somebody would give us a hug and a word of support. We should all stop being scared of expressing our deepest feelings, and learn to forgive. Don't do this. It hurts. Just go. - Come on, a farewell hug. - I said no. It hurts. Just go and don't look back. How about, on this New Year's Eve, we all try to forgive each other? Bye, Boris! I know it's really difficult to just forgive somebody. But if we can't do it even on a special day like today we might end up completely alone. And it's just... ...just unbearable. Oh, I saw that video today. Good grief, so much drama around some old guy. I know... I think it's silly: the entire country is organizing this father and son reunion. Their conflict is their business. Why get involved? I got involved in a conflict once. The result? Don't even ask. - I wasn't going to. - You're a wise woman. You don't try to meddle with destiny, yours or others'. Our destiny is written in the stars. There's no point trying to fight it. It takes a miracle... Do you believe in miracles? Close your eyes. Beautiful! A true star! Galya, where have you been? Did you get the peas? I forgot. Galya, is something wrong? Galya? I just wanted you to make peace with your dad. I thought you would listen to her. To who? - To Brezhneva. - Vera? What does she have to do with it? I'm such an idiot... Galya, don't be so upset. I'm just... I... I... I bought you a new TV. With Kremlin effect. Uncle Yuri! Uncle Yuri, what are you up to? Uncle Yuri! I'm in shock... What a lying bunch of cowboys. This beam was supposed to support 200 kilos... Are you totally unhinged?! The roof... - The roof's come unhinged... - Run, Uncle Yuri! Andrey! Run, my boy! Run! That's it. It's over. Uncle Yuri, you saved my life. - You... - Get lost. You didn't even let me die in peace. Come on, Uncle Yuri... Mom simply overreacted. She'll change her mind. I want to die right here. From hypothermia. To fall asleep... like a mountaineer. "You're an idiot" An idiot? What do you mean, I'm an idiot?! Damn it, the plan didn't work. Let's drop you off at home? I really, really like you! I won't be a slowpoke anymore! - Slow down! - No! This is my chance at happiness! Slow down!!! Evgeny, please open the door. I understand, we're nobody to you... But you're alone and we're alone. Be our grandfather! Go away. No. Let us in or we'll be celebrating New Year outside your door. Come on, open the door. Let's sit around the table and have fun, all of us together, Evgeny! Don't be stupid, Andrey. You're too young to die. Go do your military service instead. Uncle Yuri... I have a proposal to make. Would you be my dad already? Pasta and chicken... Pasta and chicken... Pasta and chicken. - Why did you get off the train? - He turned out to be pretty lame. Listen... Do you remember where I left my car? - How did you find me? - I just did. My intuition led me. I'll have a double cappuccino please. You're such an idiot! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! - The salad is delicious without peas. - Let's bid the old year goodbye. ...I'm so happy we've gathered here to welcome in the New Year. We're all different, but there's one thing that unites us all - love. On the last night of the year we all have very important words to say. And I'd like to make an announcement. This goes out to Denis Prokhorov, a doctor from Nizhny Novgorod. None of us is perfect. Everyone makes mistakes. But a family should stay together. Today and always. Denis, forgive your dad. I have a toast. To the children! I can see how much you love little Yulia and little Leo. Love them. Cherish them. They'll grow up knowing how to love their own children. Here's to children. Who could that be? Hello... Dad. Hello, son. Meet my wife Galya. - Hello. - Hello, Galya. And meet your granddaughter Nastya. Everyone, please meet my granddaughter Anastasia Prokhorova. Denis' daughter! Well? Are you ready for the best new year of your lives? By the way, be careful - there's a couple of ramps down below. Not safe for skiers. Don't listen to him. I'm with you. Don't be scared, ok? We'll go snowplow and... Come on, make a move. You're so indecisive. Look who's talking. We'll go back to Tanya's now. Under her windows, I'll stomp out in huge letters, "Tanya, marry me." We'll pour kerosene over the letters and light them. I want the whole district to see it. We'll do it in style, extravagant. I brought you some food. "...Galya and I are now together..." Galya! I mean, Tanya! - Galya? - Who's Galya? Who's Galya? There's no Galya. Tuesdays and Saturdays, 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. Sounds good? Maybe until 2 p.m.? Alright. My dears... This is so wonderful. Today, we've all gathered around this table. Marina, see? Even Evgeny made it on time. - I told you we'd meet again. - Happy New Year, buddy. Eight years have flown by like one day, like December 31. Cut! Happy New Year! And just like that, the era of Yolki in cinema is over. Our favorite characters bid each other farewell. Pirate and Yoko barked their goodbyes. Even the jingle bells stopped jingling for a while. Only our small planet continues on its course around the Sun. And with it, our vast country. along with new characters whose stories we don't yet know. But that will be a completely new chapter. This is a thankless job. Narrating is the most thankless job in the universe. They don't feed me, I have a schedule for toilet breaks... It's a dog's life, don't you agree? Take my colleagues for instance: filming the last scene took 40 takes. They had champagne and real food: otherwise they won't "get into character." Did anyone bring me so much as a small canape? Nope. I'm sitting there, my stom... I mean, soul is rumbling. Why soul? Because that's my main instrument at work. Any idiot can write a text like this one. Narration is what makes a difference. It's an art form, I'm telling you...
