Yeah, two, three miles, straight up the trail. Cattle look pretty scrawny. Yeah. Me and my brothers, we're trailin' 'em on to California. If you ain't got 'em committed to no shipper, I'll take 'em off'n your hands. Not interested. Make you a good offer. Pay you in silver, three dollars a head. Nope. Might raise it to five dollars silver. Made more than that in Mexico. They'll be a sorry-lookin' lot by the time they get to California, son. They'll feed out when we get to grass country. Sure is rough-lookin' country. Ain't no cow country. Mighty different where I come from. - What do they call this place? - Just over the rise there... big town called Tombstone. - A fine town. - Tombstone? Yeah, I heard of it. Well, me and my brothers might... ride in there tonight. Get ourselves a shave, maybe. Glass of beer. Yeah, you would enjoy yourself. Wide awake, wide open town, Tombstone. Get anything you want there. Thank you. [Whip Cracks] Hyah! James, this is mighty fine chow. One of these days you're gonna be as good a cook as Ma. Well, I'm learnin', tryin'. That's what I keep tellin' him. Corie Sue ain't marryin' him 'cause he's so pretty. 'Cause he's such an awful good cook. There goes that chingadera again. That sure is a mighty pretty piece of brass. Brass? That's solid silver. Twenty-five American dollars worth of solid silver. Ain't it, brother Wyatt? Yeah, it sure is, James. Don't let him fool ya. It's gonna look mighty pretty with them yellow curls of Corie Sue's. Ain't that the truth now. Let's mount up. If we're going to town, let's get goin'. $25 gold. By garnies, you sure got a bargain. - [Man] - Whoa, girl. Whoa! - So long, James. - So long, James. So long, Wyatt. Morgan. So long, Virgil. ## [Up-tempo] [People Yelling, Whooping] [Morgan] There it is... Tombstone. [Wyatt] Let's go. - ## [Honky-tonk] - [Chattering] - ## [Honky-tonk] - [Chattering] Good evening, gentlemen. Welcome to the Bon Ton Tonsorial Parlor. - Barbershop? - Well, if you wanna call it that. What can I do for you? - Shave. - Haircut? - Shave. - We give baths too. Shave. I don't know how to work it so good. Only had it a week. Come all the way from Chicago. - Say, you fellas miners? - No. Prospectors, huh? We're cattlemen. Just passing through here. Shave, please. - [Gunshot] - [Women Screaming] Hey! - Hey, barber! - [Gunshot] What kind of a town is this? - Barber! - [Gunshots] - [Gunshots Continue] - [People Yelling, Screaming] - [Gunshot] - [Women Screaming] Well, Luke, you know your duty. You and your marshals go on in there and get him out. That's Indian Charlie in there, drunk... and I ain't committin' suicide on myself. - Me neither. - No, sir. I ain't a-goin' in there. What kind of town is this anyway? Excuse me, ma'am. A man can't get a shave without getting his head blowed off. You're the marshal, ain't ya? Go get that drunk Indian outta there. Why don't you go in and get him out yourself? - They ain't payin' me for it. - And they ain't payin' me enough either. - [Indian Charlie] ?Ay! - [Gunshots] [People Yelling, Screaming] [Glass Breaking] Young man, you be careful! Yee-ha! - [Women Scream] - It's all right, ladies. I don't blame ol' Luke. I wouldn't go in there either. [Laughs] [Punches Land, Thudding] What kind of a town is this anyway? Selling liquor to Indians. [Groans] Put a knot on his head bigger than a turkey's egg. Indian, get outta town and stay out! How would you like to stay on here? As marshal, I mean. Nope. Barber! - 200 a month goes with this badge. - Not interested. I'm just passin' through, tryin' to get me a relaxin' little shave. - We'll make it 250. - Not interested. Hey, Mr. Bon Ton! - Shave, please. - Well, we sure wanna thank you, Mr... - Earp. Wyatt Earp. - Wy... You're not, by any chance, the marshal from Dodge City? Ex-marshal. The cattle's gone! James? James! [Knocking] - Mayor, is that marshalin' job still open? - It sure is. - I'll take it. - It's yours. Providing my brothers are my deputies. - When do you wanna start? - Now. Who runs the gamblin' around here? Doc Holliday, mostly. - Who runs the cattle? - The Clantons. Old man Clanton and his four sons. Good evening, Mr. Clanton. Good evening. I'm the fella with the trail herd. Remember? Oh, sure, I remember you. You was right. I didn't get very far with them. They was rustled this evening. That so? Well, that's too bad. Guess you'll be heading for California, huh? No, I figured on stickin' around a while. Got myself a job. - Cow punchin'? - Marshalin'. Marshalin'? In Tombstone? [Laughs] Well, good luck to you, Mr... Earp. Wyatt Earp. 1864. 1882. Eighteen years. Didn't get much of a chance, did you, James? [Clattering] I wrote to Pa and Corie Sue. They're gonna be all busted up over it. Corie Sue's young, but Pa... Guess he'll never get over it. I'll be coming out to see you regular, James. So will Morg and Virg. We're gonna be around here for a while. Can't tell, maybe when we leave this country... young kids like you will be able to grow up and live safe. [Man] Hyah! Hyah! Well, what'd you find out? I followed their trail from Clanton country to the river. They're moving cattle all right. Well, get yourself some sleep. There's coffee on the stove and some beans. Morg's riding shotgun to Tucson. Say, maybe I'd better ask around the banks while I'm down there, huh? No, they're too smart for that. ## [Piano, Fiddle] [Woman] Chihuahua, sing us the one about the old blind mule.

I hear Doc's coming back tonight. Maybe he is and maybe he ain't. I ain't heard. Well, uh, do you know where he's been? Tucson. Over the border. Who knows where Doc goes? I love poker. Yes, sir, I really love poker. Every hand a different problem. I gotta do a little figurin' here. What would I do if I was in your boots, Mr. Gambler? You drew three cards and I stood pat, and yet you raised me. Now the question is, what should I do? Yeah, mighty interesting game, poker. Game of chance. Listen, miss, I admire poker, but you're increasing the odds. I catch you doing that again, I'll run you back to the Apache reservation... - Listen, Mr. Tin-star Marshal. - where you belong. This is Doc Holliday's town, and when he comes back... [Screaming] Oh! Sorry, gents, but I don't like eight-handed poker games. Oh, Mr. Marshal, you don't think that I... No, no. Well, where were we? He just raised you, Marshal. Oh, yeah. Well, seeing as you know I got three of a kind... I guess I'll... Hiya, Doc. [Mac] Have a good trip? [Man] Doc Holliday. Nice-lookin' fella. [Mac] Doc, don't let's have any trouble, huh? I told you to get out of town and stay out. Oh, Doc, I'll cut you in on the game. I told you to get out of town. Check me in, will you? That door's for ladies and gentlemen. Go on with your game, gentlemen. Well, you can cash me in. It's getting late. I'll see you all later. It sure is a hard town for a fella... to have a quiet game of poker in. - Howdy. - Good evening. - I'm... - Wyatt Earp. I know. I know all about you and your reason for being here, but... Heard a lot about you too, Doc. You left your mark around in Deadwood, Denver and places. In fact, a man could almost follow your trail... goin' from graveyard to graveyard. There's one here too. The biggest graveyard west of the Rockies. Marshals and I usually get along much better when, uh... we understand that right away. Get your meaning, Doc. Good. Have a drink? Thanks. Believe I will. Mac, a glass of champagne for the marshal. Make it whiskey. You're my guest, Marshal. Champagne. Champagne it is, Mac. [Snapping Fingers] - [Champagne Cork Pops] - ## [Piano] Plan on staying here long? A while. Till you catch the rustlers that killed your brother? That's the general idea. What's the specific idea? I don't follow you quite. You haven't taken it into your head to deliver us from all evil. I hadn't thought of it quite like that, but ain't a bad idea. It's what I'm gettin' paid for. Let's get down to cases, Marshal. I, for instance. How would you handle me if I took a notion to break the law? You already have. For example. Runnin' that tinhorn out of town. That's none of your business. I see we're in opposite camps, Marshal. - Draw. - [Hammer Cocks] ## [Stops] Can't. We can take care of that easily enough. Mac. My brother Morg's gun. The big one, that's Morg. The other one, that good-lookin' fella, that's my brother Virg. This is Doc Holliday, fellas. - Hiya, Doc. - Howdy. Howdy. Have a drink. - [Chattering] - ## [Resumes] Don't mind if I do, Doc. - Join us, Mac. - Yes, sir. Thanks. Gentlemen. - Your health. - Your health, Doc. [Coughing] - ## [Stops] - [Cheering] Thank you. Come, come, my good man. Let me have service, or I'll take my patronage elsewhere. ## [Piano, Fiddle] Your foot, sir. Champagne. That's the actor in tonight's show. Shakespeare in Tombstone. [Mac] Coming right up, Mr. Shakespeare. It's been a long time since I've heard Shakespeare. How would you like to join me tonight, Marshal? Yeah, fine. Better see he gets to the theater, or there won't be any show. Mac, cash in for me, will you? Yes, sir. Dad, take Mr. Thorndyke over to the Bird Cage. Bird cage? You're incarcerating me in a bird cage, sir? - That's the name of the theater. - The theater? The show. Good heavens! The show must go on. Lead on. Drinks on the house! [Cheering] ## [Band] ?Tortillas! ?Enchiladas! ?Con cerveza! ?Tortillas! ?Enchiladas! ?Con cerveza! May I present my friend Wyatt Earp. - Him? A friend? - "He," not him. Well, he or him, he ain't no friend of mine. What she's trying to say, Doc, is, uh, we've met before. Sort of found ourselves together in a eight-handed poker game. ## [Fanfare] - [Clears Throat] - Ladies... [Women Cheering] - And gentlemen. - [Men Cheering] Owing to circumstances that I had nothing to do with... the show, The Convict's Oath, will not appear tonight. [Crowd Jeering] But, as if I didn't already have enough trouble... that eminent actor, that sterling tragedian... Mr. Granville... [Crowd] Thorndyke! Has completely disappeared. [Yelling, Jeering] Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Listen... Wait a minute. What are you acting so mad about? Why, this is the fourth time this year this has happened, Marshal. Bird imitators. Bird imitators, that's all we get. - Gentlemen, I can explain. - What are you fixin' to do about it? Marshal, be reasonable. All we want to do is to ride him around town... - a couple of times on the rail. - [Crowd Agreeing] Well, that sounds reasonable enough to me. - Oh, no, not that. - Oh, no! Wait a minute, boys! Wait a minute. I got a better idea. Just give me 15 minutes and I think I can find this Mr... - [Crowd] Thorndyke! - I'll bring him back here. Now sit down. Take your seats again. Have another beer. [Crowd Chattering] Look, Yorick. Can't you give us nothing but them poems? I have a very large repertoire, sir. Great. All right, Yorick. Go ahead. Shoot. [All Laughing] Minstrel, pray help me. ## [Piano] Wait. I wanna hear this. Thank you. To be, or not to be... that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind... to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune... or to take arms against a sea of troubles... and by opposing end them? To die, to sleep... no more. And by a sleep, to say we end the heartaches... and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to... 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep. To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub... for in that sleep of death, what dreams may come... when we have shuffled off this mortal coil... That's enough! That's enough! [Shot Glass Shatters] You don't know nothin' but them poems. You can't sing. Maybe you can dance. [Doc] Leave him alone. Please go on, Mr. Thorndyke. - Thank you, gentleman. - ## [Piano Continues] Must give us pause. There's the respect... that makes calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time... the law's delay, the insolence of office... and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy take... when he himself might his quietus make... with a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, to grunt and sweat... under a weary life... life. Please help me, sir. "But that the dread of something after death." Would you carry on? I'm afraid... it's been so long. The undiscover'd country... from whose bourn no traveler returns... puzzles the will... and makes us rather bear those ills we have... than fly to others that we know not of. Thus, conscience does make cowards of us all. [Coughs] [Gagging] [Wheezing, Coughing] They're waiting for you at the theater, Mr. Thorndyke. Thank you, sir. Shakespeare was not meant for taverns... nor for tavern louts. Yorick stays here! [Woman] ?Qu? pasa? ?Qu? pasa? ?Parece que hay bandidos! My apologies, Marshal. Ike and Phin have had a little whiskey. Sure. I figured they was just having themselves some fun. Come on, Mr. Thorndyke. I'll take you to the theater. Stop! Stop, Pa! Stop! Stop! When you pull a gun, kill a man. Yes, Pa. [Bell Clanging] Whoa! Whoa! Tombstone, folks. All out for breakfast. All out for breakfast. [Bell Clanging] [Chattering] Come on, giddap there. Come on, giddap. - How's it going, Earp? - Fine. How are things in Deadwood, Mr. Gambler? All right, I guess. - Brother with you? - No. Get yourself some flapjacks. Stage is leaving in 30 minutes. See you're on it. Thank you. [Man] I'll prepare a room for you. Thank you. Can I help you, ma'am? Oh, Dad's usually here to take care of the... Is that your duffel up there? Yes. How about just giving me a stack of buckwheat cakes and plenty of molasses... and a steak, blood rare, couple hunks of bacon if you got some... and a big pot of... coffee. I'm looking for Dr. John Holliday. You mean Doc Holliday? - Well, I imagine so. - Oh, Doc Holliday! Why, he rode out of town about 3:00 this morning, heading south. I don't know when he'll be back, ma'am. He'll most likely be back suppertime. Maybe you'd like to have some breakfast, freshen up a bit. Oh, I would like some coffee. - Have you got a room for Miss... - Carter. Clementine Carter. Thank you. See if Josefina can't get a couple of buckets of hot water... - so she can take a bath. - Yes, Marshal. It's Doc's room. You're right across the hall from him. John's room? Oh, that's John with a mustache. He is a good surgeon, isn't he? I wouldn't know, ma'am. That's a nice picture of you. [Man] All right, folks, all together now! [All] Hip, hip, hooray! The town of Tombstone is most grateful to you for a wonderful performance. Mr. Mayor, I am most touched by your tribute. - Have one of my cards. - Thank you very much, sir. Sorry you're leaving, Mr. Thorndyke. Here's your bill. The bill. Thank you. Great souls by instinct to each other turn... demand allegiance and in friendship burn. Good night, sweet prince. - Good-bye, Mr. Actor. - Parting is such sweet sorrow. - [Horse Whinnies] - Hyah! ## [Band Playing] Hyah! Hyah! Hah! Hyah! Hyah! - [Chattering] - ## [Guitar] Would you like a glass of beer, ma'am? No, thank you. I'm looking for Dr. John Holliday. - Who? - Dr. John Holliday. Oh. Well, uh, I'll see if I can find him for you, ma'am. Thank you. - Go right in, ma'am. - Thank you. - Gentlemen. - Buenas noches, se?orita. Hello, John. Clem. I'd, uh, like you to meet a friend of mine, Wyatt Earp. Miss Clementine Carter. We've met, John. Good evening, Mr. Earp. Howdy, ma'am. I'll see you both later. - Let's eat. - What are you up to? It's wonderful to see you again, John. You are pleased that I came? - My coming has made you unhappy. - It was ill-advised. Any less ill-advised than the way you left Boston? How did you know I was here? I didn't. Finding you hasn't been easy. From cow camp to cow camp, from one mining town to another. [Sighs] Well, I should think that if nothing more... you'd be at least flattered to have a girl chase you. Look, Clem. You've got to get out of here. - But I'm not. - This is no place for your kind of person. What kind of a person am I, John? Please go back home, Clem. Back where you belong. Forget the... [Coughs] Does this happen to John frequently? Oui, mademoiselle. Each time it's worse. You're ill, John. So that's the reason you left. That has nothing to do with it. Foolish, foolish John, as if that would have mattered. I tell you, Clem, the condition of my health has nothing to do with it. I don't believe you, John. Then I'll give you the truth. The man you once knew is no more. There's not a vestige of him left. Nothing. Come. I'll take you back to the hotel. Please, John, you can't send me away like this. You can't run away from me any more than you can run away from yourself. Now I know why you don't care whether you live or die... why you tried to get yourself killed. I've heard all about you, John, and you're wrong. So wrong. You have no right to destroy yourself. You have a world of friends back home who love you, John. And I love you. There's a stage leaving in the morning for the East. Take it. If you don't, I'm moving on. Very well, John. I'll go. - ## [Piano] - [Chattering, Yelling] Dr. John Holliday. From where I'm standing, Earp, that tin badge you're wearing... doesn't give you the right to stick your nose in my personal affairs. What's eating you, Doc? Why didn't you tell me Miss Carter was here? She told you why. She wanted to surprise you. [Glass Breaks] Give me a clean glass, Mac. You're not gonna start with drinking whiskey again, are you? Give me a glass, Mac! I'll pour it. Doc. That stuff'll kill ya. # Oh, the first kiss is always the sweetest # # From under a broad sombrero # # The first kiss # # Is always # # The sweetest # # From under # # A broad # # Sombrero ## ## [Band Continues] Why don't you go away? Squall your stupid little songs and leave me alone. ## [Stops] ## [Piano: New Song] - [Glass Shatters] - ## [Stops] - I'm gonna see if I can get Doc to bed. - Oh, why don't you finish your supper? - Have a drink. - No, thanks, Doc. I said have a drink. No, thanks. I just finished supper. Look, Doc. I ain't tried to poke my nose into your personal affairs. But from where I stand... a man would have to go a long ways before he finds a finer girl... than that Miss Carter. Or a prettier one, for that matter. Ain't a man west of the Mississippi who wouldn't give his shirt to... Marshal, you've said enough. Just as you say, Doc. And this isn't any of your business either. [Coughing] Keep that up, and you'll be out of business. You've just given me a brilliant idea, Marshal. It's time I tempted fate. - Let's see. - [Hammer Cocks] Who's in here I don't particularly like? That's a sucker game, Doc. There's probably 50 fellas around town just waiting to see you get liquored up... so they can fill you full of holes. Build themselves up a great reputation... the man that killed Doc Holliday. [Woman Screams] Mac. Give me a hand. Let's get him to bed. ## [Up-tempo] [Bell Tolling] - You don't think that's kinda... - No, sir. No, sir! New chair gets in next week from Kansas City, Kansas. Fine. Fine. - [Squirts] - Sweet-smellin' stuff, Mr. Earp. Sweet-smellin' stuff. - You have a good breakfast? - Yeah. Stowed away a whole skillet full of ham and eggs. Feel good. Uh, figured on getting a buckboard and maybe goin' up and see James. Good idea. Thinkin' I might ride out there later this afternoon myself. If I wasn't in the territory... I'd swear we were back home on a Sunday morning. [Chuckles] Yeah, with Ma scrubbing our necks to go to camp meeting. By golly, I'll bet that's what it is... a camp meeting. Could be. You know... I swear I can almost smell the honeysuckle blossoms. That's me. Barber. - Whoa! - Good morning. - [Woman] Morning. - Mornin'. You gentlemen are comin' to church this morning, I hope. We're havin' our first social gathering to raise enough money to finish the church. See, what'd I tell you. It's a camp meeting. Camp meetin'? No such a dad-blasted thing! - Pa! - Regular church. Oh, is that what they're buildin'? I was wondering what that fresh-cut lumber was for. Yes, sir. Roof will be on next week. Yes, I was hoping that you single men would come. - Be awful nice for the dancin'. - Yeah. Sis here is single. [Laughs] Dad-blasted good dancer too. Well, thank you, ma'am... but my brothers got sort of a job of work to do... and I oughta stay around the place. Well, keepin' the peace is no whit less important. Get goin', Sis. Good day. - [Woman] Good day. - Good day. You know, there's probably a lot of nice people round here. We just ain't met 'em. Come on, Morg. Let's get started. I'd kinda like to get back for that dancin'. [Whinnies] And as for you, when Doc finds out you butted him last night... he'll twist that tin badge around your heart! I'm Chihuahua. I'm Doc Holliday's girl. Just wanted to make sure you were packing. - Stop slamming doors! - [Clattering] People bellowing, dropping pitchers on the floor. I get no rest. I'm sorry, darling. You're not mad, are you? Sure not. What right have I got to be mad at anyone or anything? She's packin', Doc. She's leaving town. Happy, aren't you? I ain't sad. Get me that thing, huh? [Exhales] Chihuahua, I'm going into Mexico... for a week or 10 days, and while I'm gone... Take me with you, Doc, will ya? Why not? [Coughs] Why not? Tell Fran?ois to fix a bridal breakfast... flowers, champagne. You get in your prettiest dress. Tell him the queen is dead. Long live the queen. Oh... Oh, Doc. [Bell Dinging] [Dinging] ## [Whistling: "My Darling Clementine"] ## [Stops] - Mornin', Miss Carter. - Good morning, Mr. Earp. Are you leavin'? Yes, I'm leaving for the East on the stage. Eastbound stage don't leave till noon on Sunday. It's a mighty short visit. Some people think I've overstayed my visit already. I don't know, ma'am, but... if you ask me, I-I think you're giving up too easy. - Marshal, if you ask me, I... - [Bell Tolling] I don't think you know too much about a woman's pride. No, ma'am, maybe I don't. Girls, don't forget to be back in time for Sunday dinner, now. I'm sorry about your bags, Miss Carter. I didn't get a chance to get 'em down. The girls put together a packed lunch for you. Well, bless my soul. He did it. Good morning, miss. Good morning, Marshal. John Simpson said he'd have a church, and he has. Church bells in Tombstone. I believe that's the first church bell I've heard in months. [Chuckling] Yes. Well. [Tolling Continues] I love your town in the morning, Marshal. The air's so clean and clear. The scent of the desert flowers. That's me. - Barber. - Oh. ## [Organ] Marshal, may I go with you? [Choir] # Shall we gather at the river? # You are going to the services, aren't you? ## [Choir Continues Singing] Why, yes, ma'am. - I'd admire to take you. - Thank you. ## [Choir Continues Singing] # Flowing from the throne of God # # Yes, we'll gather at the river # # The beautiful, the beautiful river # # Gather with the saints at the river # # That flows from the throne of God # # Yes, we'll gather at the river # # The beautiful, the beautiful river # # Gather with the saints at the river # # That flows from the throne of God ## Now, folks... I hereby declare the first church of Tombstone... which ain't got no name yet, nor no preacher either... officially dedicated. Now, I don't pretend to be no preacher... but I've read the good book from cover to cover and back again... and I nary found one word against dancin'. So we'll commence by havin' a dad-blasted good dance. - [Cheering] - [Foot Stomping] ## [Square Dance] Will you oblige me, ma'am? Thank you. [Whooping, Chattering] - Hold it, folks! Dad-blast it, hold it! - ## [Stops] Sashay back and make room for our new marshal... and his lady fair. [Whooping] ## [Resumes] [Men Whooping] Well, by garnies. Marshal, I hope you're as good a dad-blasted carver... as you are a dad-blasted good dancer. [Laughing] - Oh, you know... - [Chattering Continues] [Wyatt] What's your preference? [Simpson] It makes no difference, Marshal. Anything. Anything. [Woman] Now, you told the church. You know... Pardon me for intruding on your dinner party, Marshal. It's all right, Doc. Sit down and join us. Look, Clem, I told you last night to leave Tombstone and go back East. I also told you if you didn't leave, I would. Hey, Doc. Just a minute, Doc. That's the second time in three days... you've been tryin' to run somebody out of town. That's my business. That's what I'm gettin' paid for. Miss Carter or any other decent citizen... can stay here just as long as they want to. We're through talking, Marshal. My advice to you is start carrying your gun. That's good advice. Hyah! ?Mamacita? Doc's gone. He's left town. He was goin' to Mexico... and take me with him. He was gonna marry me. Well, you're leavin' too. What's the matter, Miss Carter? I think it's just a common case of hysteria, Marshal. - Oh, it is, is it? - What are you doin' here? - None of your business! - Why don't you behave yourself? - Get out. Go on back where you belong. - I'm not gettin' out till she leaves town! Why, do you want me to take you over my knee and spank you? You take your hands off me! Leave me alone. What do you know about it anyway? What do you know about Doc and me? We was going to Mexico and get married. Yes, he was gonna marry me till this Miss Milkface... comes pussyfootin' along and... - Where'd you get that? - Doc give it to me. - Where do you think I got it? - You ain't lyin'? Why should I lie about it? He gives me everything I've got! I got a whole roomful of stuff down there! Keep your door locked, Miss Carter. See that this wildcat stays in her room, will ya? And tell Virg to stick around. What's up? Doc Holliday. Where's Holliday? He came in about a half an hour ago, got his saddlebags... and a sack of gold out of the safe and left in a hurry. - Were you lookin' for Doc? - I am. Well, he left on the bullion stage riding shotgun. - Left town? - For Tucson. Get my bay mare and have her up to the jail, will you, Jess? Sure. You. Whiskey for my boys. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! I think the Huachuca Pass is your best bet, Wyatt. Good luck. Thank you, Jess. [Whinnies] Hyah! Hyah! Hah! Hyah! Hey! Hey! Hyah! Dinnego, how long ago did the stage come through here? - About 15, 20 minutes ago. - Doc Holliday on it? Yes, he was, and he was sure goin' to town. I need a couple of fresh horses. Cut me out two stout ones. - ??ndale, fuera! - One that'll lead well. All right, Marshal. [Wyatt] That bay looks good. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Get on there! Get on! Get on! Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Get on there! Get on! Get on! Get on there! Get on! Hey! Hey! Get on there! Get on! Get on! Get on! Get on! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! - Pull up! - Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Easy. Whoa. Whoa. I told you I'm through talking, Marshal. You're comin' back to Tombstone with me, Doc. Sorry. I'm not going back. Well, in that case, I'll be takin' you back. Go for your gun, Marshal. You call it, Doc. [Knocking] [Knocking Continues] - Who is it? - The marshal. Why don't you go chase yourself up an alley! Who do you think you are, busting into people's rooms at night? [Doc] Chihuahua, open this door! Doc? Is that you, Doc? [Doc] I said open this door! Yeah, Doc. Yeah. Just a minute. Chihuahua! Chihuahua, open this door before I kick it down! Yeah, Doc. Let me get something on. Well, hurry up! [Knocking] Chihuahua! Come in, Doc. Chihuahua, why did you tell the marshal I gave you this jewelry? - [Door Closing] - [Footsteps Approaching] Well, you did, Doc. You give it to me. I never saw this piece of junk before in my life. Who gave it to you? Well, you can't remember everything you give me, Doc. Sure, you did. Don't you remember? When? Well, two or three days ago. I don't know. What difference does it make? That being the case, Doc, I charge you with the murder of my brother James Earp. - Doc, he's foolin', ain't he? - I ain't foolin'. It was stolen from him the night he was shot in the back. [Sighs] Now do you still insist I gave it to you? Oh, no. No, of course not. Then who did? I ain't gonna be a squealer, Doc. Let's go, Doc. [Sighs] Well, you told me to go away... and squall my silly little song somewhere else. So I came up here and had a good cry. There was a knock at the door... and I thought it was you. I opened the door, and... - It was Billy Clanton. - [Gunshots] Hyah! Hyah! [Gunshot] Billy Clanton! Go get him, Virg! Hah! [Chattering In Spanish] - What's happened? - There's been a shootin'. Stay outside, fellas. [Women Speaking In Spanish] Wyatt, she's badly hurt. Mayor, you'd better send to Huachuca for an army doctor. We have to operate immediately. That'll take five or six hours, Doc. You're a doctor, ain't ya? [Scoffs] Doctor. [Woman Speaking Spanish] [Spanish] Morg, go over to the Mansion House. Get Miss Carter. She's a nurse. Tell her to stop by Doc's room and get that doctor's bag. All right. - Mac. - Yeah? You and Buck go down and clean up the saloon. Put a couple of poker tables together and put some lights around 'em. Sure. Doc, you're gonna operate. - Rub her feet, Kirby. Rub her feet. - Hurry, Doc. ## [Piano] [Laughter] Mac, the light. Over here. [Whooping In Distance] [Woman] Doc's here, honey. She's been right brave. I'm sorry, Doc. [Men Whooping] Still mad? No, honey. Look. I haven't got anything to put you to sleep... so this is going to hurt like blazes. Yell, scream, holler... anything you like. Tell me when you're ready. Bite on it. Bite hard. [Whooping Continues] [Chihuahua Whimpering] Oh... Oh, Ma. [Woman] There, there, honey. Doc's gonna help you. [Whinnies] [Galloping Hoofbeats] [Knocking] I'm looking for your brother, Billy Clanton. He's right in there, Mr. Earp. My boy Billy... shot down in the streets of Tombstone. Murdered. It's too bad it had to end this way, Mr. Clanton. [Gunshot] Get mounted. ## [Piano: Honky-tonk] [Chattering, Laughing In Distance] Hi, Doc. You're all right. You've been a brave girl. All right. Lift her up gently. Doc... I-I mean, Doctor. I'm gonna take her to my house and take good care of her. Can't I do that, Marshal? Sure. Phew. - Doctor Holliday. - [Chuckles] Thanks. [Chuckles] I'm awfully proud of you, John. Thanks, Clem. She was a brave girl. Mac. You ever been in love? No, I've been a bartender all my life. - [Gunshots] - [Hoofbeats Approaching] We'll be waitin' for you, Marshal, at the O.K. Corral! - [Knocking] - [Man] Marshal! Well, the Clantons are at the O.K. Corral, all right. They're barricaded down there, all four of 'em. Marshal, we want you to count us in on this. We ain't fightin' men, but we'd sure like to help you out. Thanks, Deacon, but this is strictly a family affair. What's the matter, they too yellow to come out and fight? They'll come. Easy on that keg, Son. [Knocking] How's Chihuahua? She's dead. Doctor John Holliday. When do we start? Sunup. Sunup, Ike. Phin! Sam! Sun's comin' up, Marshal. [Clatters] Got everything straight? - Yeah. - Yeah. Let's go. [Horse Whinnying] [Dog Barking] Here they come. Doc Holliday's with 'em. Wait till they get closer, you fools! Phin, cover your brother. [Gunshot] [Hoofbeats Approaching] Mornin', Mr. Clanton. Let's talk a while. [Clanton] Ike! Well, now... you go right ahead and talk. I got a warrant here for you and your sons... chargin' the murder of James and Virgil Earp. There's also a charge of cattle rustlin'. I'm givin' you a chance to submit to proper authority. Well, you come on right in here, Marshal, and serve your warrant. Which one of ya killed James? I did. And the other one too. [Hoofbeats Approaching] And I'm gonna kill you. [Driver] Hyah! [Coughing] [Whinnying] [Whinnying] [Whinnying] Throw your gun down and come on out, old man. My boys. Ike! Sam! Phin! Billy! They're dead. I ain't gonna kill you. I hope you live a hundred years... feel just a little what my pa's gonna feel. Now get out of town! Start wanderin'! Wyatt. - Doc? - Yeah. [Carriage Approaching] Good-bye, ma'am. Mighty nice to have made your acquaintance. Get along, horses. [Carriage Departing] There are so many things I wanted to say. Now nothing seems appropriate. Yes, ma'am, I... Yeah, I know. The mayor says you might be stayin' here a while... maybe help him get a school started. Yes. I'm the new schoolmarm. That's mighty nice, ma'am. Me and Morg are goin' out to see Pa... tell him what happened. I might come East again, get some cattle... maybe stop by here again. Stop by the schoolhouse? Yes, ma'am, I sure will. - Good-bye, ma'am. - Good-bye. [Chuckles] Ma'am. I sure like that name... Clementine. # I'll be lovin' you forever # # Oh, my darlin' Clementine ##
