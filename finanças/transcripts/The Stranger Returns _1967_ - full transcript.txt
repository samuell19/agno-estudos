* WESTERN JACK * Come here, Pussy. Come on over here. That's a good girl. Come on. Hi. Hi. The coach is traveling with $200,000 on board. It's no doubt about it out that some soldiers are following it. They won't catch up with them until they get to Moon Village. That's all right, Inspector Ross. Go on. Mr. Stanley has decided to make a trip to the Mexican border. But I personally convinced him to stop in Moon village for a change of horses. You have to get there first before the soldiers arrive. You did a fine job, Inspector. Well... I'm just waiting for the money. The sum we've agreed upon. What do you worry about it, Inspector. The money is here, and you'll get all of it. You, climb up there and when the coach arrives, you whistle. All right. Hayah, come on Pussy. Come on! Bang, bang, bang!... A relative of yours? Well, I don't know how it's done around here, but I never heard of a burial in the water trough. Besides, my horse here can't drink. Right you are, mister. Why don't you dig that body a proper grave? Okay, boss. The Lord will be my witness. I never refused doing a man a favor. Be careful now. Don't make it too small. I figure that ought to be, '6, '5, '4, that ought to be right. Well, that should just about do it. How tall are you? About six feet. Six with the hat. Now how about that. You can start digging another grave, the same size. It looks kind of wide. No, I don't think so. Well, I finally got myself a profession. Now go get the body! Go on! Postal Inspector Ross. But first! Say it was you! Say it! I told you, not to hit him in the face. I don't believe that your wife and daughter approve of stubbornness, right Austin? You sure don't look like the daughter of your father. Your mother grabbed somebody who looked like me. Go on, tell Mr. En Plein, what you think about that. You've taken enough punishment, Jim. Yes, father. Don't let them kill you. "Yes, father". Because Austin can't wait to get his hands on your daughter. Now Jim, I'm gonna lose my patience. There won't be a single man in all these families alive when we leave. Right, Alvarez? Right. We're in trouble, Jim. That's enough. Besides, what is your duty? Meet the passengers with a smile when the horses are changed? That's all we're asking you to do. The coach will arrive with an escort. We don't want any trouble. Just your duty! All right. I'll do it. Yes! Go to your homes and hide in your dirty cabins! For the Lord knows that you are too low to be his servant of charity! Yeah i just want! THe few cents that he needs to nourish this poor mortal body. Exodus, chapter 20, verse 24. And I shall sacrifice sick animals, I know that! thy sheep, thy cows... And again: chapter 25, verse 1! I will accept the gifts of every man, that giveth it willingly with his heart. Gold, silver and even brass! Old shoes, used clothes, eggs, fish, as everything for the glory of God! Have you heard the words of the Bible? All the sons of good women? Yeah, have you heard the pride of the devil's voice? Have you seen the fires of hell? Come out of your dirty holes! Yeah! Come forward and buy yourself a one-way ticket to paradise! What's it cost? What's what cost? This ticket. Spiritually or materially speaking? One or the other. Well... seeing as you're interested I'd say material wise, it costs you as much as your pocket can afford. But not less than one dollar. Spiritual wise... Well, now that's a long discourse. Well, I'm in no hurry. You must be a stranger in town. I don't recall ever seeing you around in these parts before. Does it make a difference? For the ticket? No. Well, let's the go on with the ceremony. Solomon. Book one, Solomon one. Hear the word of God! Blessed is he who doesn't walk to the advice of the non-believers! Who doesn't start to the path of the sinners! Hello, prophet. Hello there, Mr. Austin. May the good Lord bless and look down on you. Now, that would be something. Wouldn't it, prophet? Get off that pulpit of yours! A go find customers for the Lord somewhere else! Frankly, sir, how can you allow your servants to interfere with the spreading of the word of God? Look... If I were you, prophet, I wouldn't discuss it. Well, I was about to leave anyway. What kind of prophet are you? What kind of prophet am I? Just a minute ago you were yelling like a wild man that nobody would listen. Now you got all these ears listening. There are ears and ears in this world. Well these ears like listening to the word of God, the prophet. Well. Ah!... Sniff it in prophet, and tell me what you feel! I smell trouble. That's what I smell. If I was your Lord, prophet, I sure would lose faith in you. Besides... I'm interested in that ticket to heaven you were talking about. This will cover the material price. Mister, that was one of those brand new federal dollars. I don't want any trouble. All you had to do is come on and say what you wanted. The Lord will be my witness. I never refused a man a favor. Mister, I'm leaving. Prophet, you're right. Hm, hm!... I can smell trouble around here. Who are they? Around here they call them "The Treasure Of the border". What? Together, they're worth 10,000 dollars reward. Hm, hm!... The one who did the shooting, what's his name? En Plein, that's what they call him. Do you know what En Plein means? One who never misses. Hmm!... Let me see the coin. The what? The dollar. Ah!... Somebody can do better. Thank you. So long, old man. Are you going back there? Fact is, I like places that smell of trouble. Something good might turn up. If these fellows is what you're looking for, you don't have far to look... Take his gun! Amen. Was he the one? It he the one? It he the one? I don't know! It he the one? Who am I supposed to be? There happened to be three men back at the watering trough. Four. You'll have to pay for three. Kill him! An no noise! Woa!... Hi, Jess. Hi, Jim. Everything all right? Yes, sir. How far away is it from here to the border? Thirty miles, sir. Get these horse changed. We don't want to be here any longer than necessary. Donald. Yes? I'm a little tired. Well. Can't I go inside and freshen up a bit? Just long enough for the change of horses. You, murderer! Hey! Hey!... Don't worry about me. Look after those poor devils outside. If it's not too late. Thank God it's not serious. Try to be calm, it's nothing. Those poor people... It's all my fault. It's all my fault. If I hadn't been such a coward, I could've warned them in time. They were armed... They could have fought back! you did more than your duty, Jim. They almost killed you. A Postal official has a certain duty. If I only may decide we made a signal to Mr. Stanley, I'll have no peace until I see they have a rope around their necks! I Will string them up with my own hands! That poor woman... Who's in charge here? Nobody. But I am the local postmaster. Who killed these people? Bandits. They entered the town a few hours ago. About 20 of them. This man here is Stanley from Arizona. His bank went out of business. He was trying to leave the country with his family. With a large quantity of gold. Examine the luggage! Who were these bandits? Did you recognize any of them? I never saw them before, Lieutenant. To tell you the truth, we were also scared that I doubt that any of us could give a description of them. As for me, they not only gave me a beating, they made me shot me. That's no excuse for not recognizing them. I can witness that that man acted with great courage. Because I was here when this awful thing took place. And Lieutenant, sir, I assure you, even you and with all your men... Who are you? Are you Westpoint? Of course. Postal Inspector Ross. What were you saying about those bandits? Well, I suppose besides the uniform you have a name. Stafford. Lieutenant Stafford. What I was saying about the bandits is that I think I recognise one of them from a wanted-poster. Who was he? En Plein. What did they take? An iron box. Probably they are headed for the border. If I were you, I wouldn't waste any time. You pardon me for saying so, Inspector, but there's two kinds of people I don't like. Those that claim they know nothing and those who claim they know everything. Let's move out! Then you pardon me for saying so, lieutenant, sir, but hard-headed men like you, either have big careers or they die young. Well said, Inspector. Be seeing you around! Oh, Lord in heaven, I humbly pray thy, to take in these poor men and find them at least a place in the servants quarters of Paradise. Amen. Amen!... Amen. You faithless men! Give this words of the goods in paradise and ride to the nearest town! You're headed for Santo Spirito, Jim? Naturally. The mail must go through. Well, I have a wedding to bless. Can I go along with you? You got the money to pay the fair? No, but the good Lord will bless you. This company doesn't give any credit to the Lord. Let him ride, mister. I stand for his fair. What are you doing back there? And who the hell are you? They call me Postal Inspector Ross. Inspector Ross? Do you got any reason not to believe me? Of course not, sir. Nice to meet you. Get in! It's okay for you to ride as long as the Inspector vouches for you. Thank you, brother! Let's go! Hyah!... What's so funny? Oh, I was just thinking about a man I met once back in Salt Lake City, who claimed he was Inspector Ross. Well, you see, in this day and age everybody is walking around trying to be somebody else. Oh yes, no doubt about it. What you want with my wife? Like money! If you want it kill me!... Chrysler, what's he talking about? Well, he says he's a poor Indian, but he's still a man. And if he had a gun, he would kill you. Give him your gun! One gun for you, one gun for him. Chrysler! Hm!... Woa!... May God ride with you, brother! Thank you, old man. And God bless you, sir! Amen. Woa!... Here we are, Inspector. I'll change the horses and... So we meet again. Yeah. There's an old friend of yours who wants to see. Well, look who's here. Inspector Ross. Jim. I knew about you from the beginning. What do you want? And what are you looking for? Mr. Stanley, before he died, made me inherit all his gold. And you thought you could get it from here. That's right. Ah!... There's the gold! Look at it! Feel it! Touch it! Where is the other stagecoach? Ah!... Nice work. It looks exactly like the other one. Not even the man who made it could tell the difference. Well... Here's your money. Thank you. Move out! You want the gold? Now, get it! Excuse me, ma'am. The ways of the Lord are infinite. They sure are? old man. You changed the coach? Yes, I tell you! That bastard... you really broken an ordinance, didn't you old man? Good Jim. What is that? The only thing my grand daddy left me when he died. It works pretty good at close range. Well, let me see it! Hm!... Well, old man, we're gonna raise some hell in Moon Village tonight. Ethel! Ethel, get your things, all that you can carry. We're leaving right now, I'll explain to you later. Where is Caroline? And where is the stagecoach? The real one. The one with the gold. The coach? You have the coach. Don't play stupid with me, good Jim. Even your wife knows what you've been up to. Ethel! You stupid fools! Don't you understand? The coach has been changed by the stranger! That false inspector Ross! When, Jim? Tell me! How am I supposed to know? It is your fault! With all your men, you should have gone after him! The stagecoach! Where is it? I don't know! I don't know! Austin! Now, don't be afraid. I am a real gentleman. I don't know! Believe me! Believe me! Stop it! Stop it! Austin is a pig, good Jim. But your daughter is a pretty little girl. Ah!... I can't hear you out there, Austin! Jim! It's in the cemetery. No! Let's go! That a lord Que esteka her ist from door He goes in me and you will be saved Get that fool down! You will die and your proud hearts will fall! Amen. How much? Ten thousand. Ten thousand? Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Hello, Inspector! You've done a good job? Well, we do what we can do. Yeah. There's a reward for you. It's in here. Here it is. No, I can't accept it. The company... But I'd appreciate it if you give it to this gentleman right here. Because he's the one that really deserves it. All right, take. I'll pray for you, brothers. And this is mine. A cigar? Thank you. Well, I guess I better be on my way. I got to get this coach back to HeadQuarters. I'll be seeing you. Bye, Inspector. You got a match? Here. Thank you. Keep them. And if you hear about that gold, lieutenant, you will sure let me know, right? Sure. Be seeing you around. I'll see you around. Now you pray for me some time, old man. Yeah, I sure will pray for you, brother! Come on, Pussy! And believe me! You'll sure will it need one day! Ah!... Some day, old man! Hyah!...
