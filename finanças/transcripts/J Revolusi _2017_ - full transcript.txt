Don't you remember? Base ordered us to capture Davron. Where is Dian? Jiman, where is Dian? l thought you knew. You were the last person to see her. What are you talking about? We couldn't find Dian. We managed to capture Davron and got the Ultra Virus but we couldn't find Dian! You haven't searched properly! She couldn't have disappeared into thin air! Do you know what your sister did? She jeopardised our whole operation. That place is vast, you guys haven't searched the place thoroughly. Well, we have to wait for forensics. Yesterday they found some human remains. You never know, one of the pieces could be your sister. Dian is still alive!! Go find her! Don't stop until yo_ve lound her, Jiman! [6 MONTHS LATER] Don't be so arrogant! What do you mean arrogant? Shah and l? l'm not afraid of him! l've beaten him before with a pestle and mortar! What? What's wrong with that guy? Jay, let's have some noodles. Hey! Go and eat by yourself! You were so brave just now. Just give me three years and l will be the next commander. Badang? You called? lf your parents were alive, they would be very proud of you. Move! Move! l'll shoot anyone who doesn't move! Get up and have your picture taken! You! l know you! Go! You! Go! And... Come on everyone! Photo time! D! Come here! Come, stand beside me. Come. Let's do it. Come on D, smile! One, Two, Three. Proud of you, silly! Proud of you, silly! You could have just called. Dian is still alive. After the lab exploded, Dian was captured by the P. F. O. And you are only telling me now? One by one the operatives involved in the mission have either been killed or gone missing. The P. F. O. have demanded that we hand over the virus before they release Dian. But HQ does not agree. Why not? HQ made the decision not to negotiate. So we are just going to leave her there? l tried to save her. But l failed. Now the P. F. O. have threatened to bomb a public area and the bomb will go off in an hour if we reluse to hand over the Ultra Virus. They've asked for you to personally deliver the virus to them. We're sure that they know Dian is your sister. So what are my orders now, Chief? Sniper Observer Dragon 2, surveillance and snipers over here. The rest will be placed around the perimeter of the building. Dragon 1 will drive up to the North entrance and enter by himself. The rest of you make sure Dragon 1 Ieaves the building with the virus. Don't forget Dian! Today we will bring her back. 1 will suppo_ you unfil you find her! Jangan risau, Jay. l don't think you should be taking the actual virus. Jiman, do you think l'm here to ask for your permission? lt has been so boring without you Jay. l've started talking to my cat for 3 days and 2 nights. Next time, don't be like this, okay?

Repeat. We have located the bomb. Tell Jay, not to hand over the virus! How am l supposed to tell him? Shall l use the bomb to tell him? Or should we take a wefie and send it to him? Hari ini bukan hari kau, Jay. D! Jay! Dragon 2, masuk. Dragon 1, saya ulang, masuk. Dragon 2, masuk. l knew it! Black, l want that status! Jay, if it wasn't for you, l wouldn't have passed the training. Don't say that, we'll stand together or we'll fall together. Remember, we are a team. Tunduk! Tunduk! 6 dead. But we haven't lound any finger prints. Teruskan pencarian. Do you know why you are here? You are our main suspect. The only one left alive. We want to know what happened. If we can believe anything you say. We found this in your car but there aren't any prints. This contraption jammed our signal just now. Forensics found it. Jadi? Jadi? l understand how you are feeling. Your squad were killed. You didn't even manage to save Dian. The P. F. O. got their virus back. - How are you going to explain this to HQ? - l don't know what l will say to HQ. Do you actually know who is behind the P. F. O. ? - Virus... - Yes! The virus. Yes, now that you've mentioned it, l just remembered. You know about the bomb they planted? Well, we found it. So truth be told you shouldn't have given the virus to them. But what can we do, it is already done. You want to save Dian? Take this. Take it. Eh! Why should l give this to you? lf l give it to you, you will just hand it over to the P. F. O. l told HQ not to let you take the real virus. But everyone believed in you. Everyone always trusts you. Do you want Dian to die, Jiman? That's not my problem. Your father is the Commander, isn't he? You'll have to answer to him. Bring Judo back to HQ for lurther questioning. Go through Jalan Pudu. We've cleared the way to Bukit Aman. Okay. Get out! Commander, we couldn't find Jay. Have a seat. We have to utilize all ol our assets to find him! Jay is not a suspect. - Then why did he run? - What has he done wrong? Commander. Some operatives in the Iab ops have been murdered. As if the P. F. O. knows all their information. We do not know whether Dian has given them this information or not. Why did he keep insisting on taking the real virus on the mission? Because he wanted to hand it over to the P. F. O! Are you accusing Jay of being a traitor? Think about it, Commander. The convoy transporting Jay was ambushed. As if they were helping him to escape. Why are you being so suspicious of Jay? Jiman has just reminded me of our training days. Do you remember when we had to escape from a room within 60 seconds? Kau ada, Jay pun ada, aku pun ada, PuIau pun ada, Nibung pun ada. Jay made it out. But you were still inside. You saw that Eddie and l had fallen down, but instead of helping, you stepped on us to get out. The question in my mind is, Jay had escaped and yet he was willing to come back in to help us. So it doesn't makes sense for a traitor to help us. Does it? Dad? Jay? Meet me at our usual place, 2. 45 PM. You don't have to trace the call. l know the place. - Thanks. - Welcome. Dad. Why are you doing this, Jay? l've been sabotaged. But you have to turn yoursell in. Sorry, l can't. They must have some ulterior motive Ior asking me to deliver the virus. We cannot be sure if it is an inside job or not. Please get on the tram, Dad. Where are you? l can surrender. But not now. l understand that you feel guilty and are trying to fix things. No Dad, you don't understand. l was intentionally released. But what about the rest? They were killed. They've got the virus. But they didn't let Dian go. They must want something more. Am l supposed to let them get away with it? You shouldn't act alone. We have to settle this together. Sorry Dad, l can't. Actually the P. F. O. 's leader is not Davron, but a man called Andra. And they are not common criminals, they know everything about us. And l want to find out why they didn't let Dian go. Before your parents passed away they asked me to look after you and Dian. l've failed. No Dad, you haven't. Peace be upon you, Dad. Peace be upon you too. l'm sorry for everything, Dad. lf l don't make it back, please take care of yourself. There! That's him! He's wearing black and white checks and a black hat. Get him, hurry! The target is gone. How can you lose him? Negative, sir. There were too many of them wearing the same shirt. He used decoys! Alert all operatives! Don't Iet him leave this place! Jay, turn yourself in. Eddie, this is public place. Put your gun down. Please Jay, don't do this. Put your gun down. Eddie. Jay! Get in! Go! Don't be stupid, Jay. Siew. l'm sorry, Eddie. The Jay l know wouldn't do something like this. Do you know what you've done? Aku pergi bancuh feh kejap. l'll make some tea. Terima kasih. Thank you. l didn't tie it tightly. You can free yourself if you want to. This place is safe. You can stay here. Siew will take care of you. Do you know what your problem is? You think you can do everything by yourself. HQ said not to take the real virus but you had to take it. - What if something happened to Dian? - It has already happened to Dian! Then you go and do this. Fantastic! You're so stubborn! You wanted to shoot me? Eddie! l don't want to get you involved, Eddie. l don't want to lose you like l lost Dian. l am going to let go. You got me involved the minute you pointed that gun at me. When our parents passed away, Dian felt like she was left alone. But l was the only one she trusted. She couldn't accept anybody else, especially Chiel. l've told her so many times that Chief loves her too, but she won't accept it. She always felt that Chief loved me more than her. She became very, very sensitive. But l don't care because she's the only family l have. l don't care if people think that l am going against our principles or anything else, l don't care. l have to find her and get her back. l'll help you. No, it's too dangerous. l have to do this alone. l'll be your co-pilot, okay? Peace be upon you, Katy! Katy Perry, Daddy's home. Why can't you learn how to greet me back? Everyday l come home and you still don't know how to greet me. Peace... be... upon... you... too! Herman, it's a sin to torture animals. Enough! Why are you back so late?

What was your name again? Iddie? Eddie. - Are you Javanese? - No, Auntie. My real name is Ida but people call me Eddie. Oh Eddie. . Id... Nevermind, l'll just call you Ida. Beautiful name. Give me a second, l'll go and get some drinks. Hey! What are both of you doing here? l don't feel sale sitting here, next to you. What is up with you guys? You! You are famous now. Eveyone is looking for you. And you? Yes, you're gorgeous but you're the same. You kidnapped him. What's going on? - He kidnapped me! Now sit down! - What do you think l am? A cat? Just sit down! Jay and Ida, please don't be shy. Help yourselves. Herman, why are you still standing? Sit down! Come let me serve you, don't be shy now. - Jay, can you please advise my son? - Kenapa? Because he comes home late every night. Meeting up with his girlfriend maybe? He tells me he has many girlfriends at work, does he? l'm not sure about girlfriends Auntie, but what l do know is he has a lot of admirers at work! - Really? - Really Auntie. Right? That's why he is sweating so much. Here, have a drink. That's wonde_ul. l thought he was just telling me tall tales. No, Auntie. Never. But he has never brought anyone home to be introduced to his own mother. l thought l had to go and find him a wife. Right, Ida? Eh Ida, do you have a boylriend? No, Auntie. She's still single. Oh really? Praise to God! You hear that Herman? You are always working. Right in front of your eyes and you are not even trying! Mak cakap apa ni? l have a lot of work to do. l'm not the kind of person who stays at home and plays with Katy. l have a lot of work to do there, Mum, rather than flirting with someone like her. l just have to snap my fingers and it's done. But l don't want to do that. Do you know the latest issue at work? You have no idea. Someone allowed something to be stolen. Why are you coughing? Terrible, right? It's a good story, isn't it? After allowing the thing to be stolen, he ran! He left us all with a big headache, Mum. A huge problem! And l'm the one who has to supply the medicine Mum. Me! lsn't that just crazy, Mum? This sort of situation. Auntie, if something is lost, just look for it. Am l right? Right? So you should find someone who is good at l. T. , who is brilliant and who can... Yes. Exactly. Oh that l. T. guy? That l. T. guy is too demanding and l don't think you can get him. Can't we convince him at all? But l heard the guy who ran is a good friend ofthat l. T. guy. That guy must have had a really good reason to run. Who else can help him besides that l. T. guy? - _ lot of... - Dah! Dah! Dah? He still won't do it? - He can'f be persuaded? - Tetap tidak. Never mind, you are both giving me a headache. l don't understand a word of what you are saying. lda, please eat. Thank you, Auntie. Just call me Mum. Let me get more food. Just go, Mum. Pergi, Mak! You are rea1ly cramping my s_yle, Mum! Mak suka kacau saya! What is going on? What did you mean when you said you can get me just by snapping your fingers? l never sweat like this. So cute, right? It's Herman's. And this is another one. Jiman asked me to take a look at the signal jammer and l immediately knew how it worked. This is called the intemace. And these things which look like terrace houses. These are the CPU. Once we have the CPU, we can find out everything! That's how good my interFace is! Just give me a second. l'll prove it to you! lf you don't know what you're touching, don't touch! Fine. You are muscular in your muscles. l'm muscular in my brain. We're so dimerent, Jay. Yes!

Dan ini1ah lokasinya. lf it is the same person using it, he can take us to Dian. Maybe. l was just going to... Eh! It's Jiman! Yes, just give me a minute. lf l were 20 years old, l could be laster. Wait. Auntie, is Skodeng [Peeping Tom] here? Skodeng? Who is Skodeng? Herman. Oh! Are you Herman's friend? Why didn't you say so? Don't you youngsters know how to greet your elders? ls Herman home? No, Herman is not at home. Really? Then why is his car in the driveway? Oh yeah. He was home just now but he went out with a Iriend. Which friend? ls this him? Who is that? Surely you know who he is. Herman's best Iriend? l don't know him. Eh, wait a minute. lsn't this that actor? In that series that l like to watch so much! What is his name again?

There hasn't been anyone foolish enough to steal things from me. We should work together, not fight each other, Jay. Not interested. This is the second time l'm asking. Where is Dian? There are times you get what you want and there are times that you don't, Jay. You need to learn that. D... Let's go. Don't you see? He is more worried about the girl than you. So, how does it feel, Jay? Being betrayed by your own family? What are you doing, D? He's pretending not to remember. Just like his father. Tell me how they found out about my lab. Who were involved? You help me, l'll help you. We are the same, Dian. We both want to serve our country. Serve with what? Your virus? With this virus, the world will be forced to unite. No more wars, no more crime. We can heal the world, Dian. Anak perempuan kau. Tengok Uia. Kau tak nak dia kembali ke? Kami cuma mahu Ultra Virus. Ifu sahaja Uan kami akan bebaskan dia. Kau tak ambi1 berat tentang anak kau? Xau tak sayan_ anak kau? l'm sorry, Commander. But we do not negotiate with terrorists. Can't you see, Dian? You can choose to fight for your father, or you can choose to fight for me. They do not care about you. Your brother, your father. They don't even care what happens to you, Dian. They don't care about you at all. Haven't you realised yet, Dian? Your brother, your father. They don't care about you at all! Yourjob is to identi_ the target! Not to capture him! You're not trained for this kind of situation! This is all just a trap. He has killed all our friends. You have killed all my friends. But you let me live. On purpose, right? lt wasn't him. It was me! Done. l've done everything. You help me, l'll help you. That's what we promised, right? You have to go through what you and your father have done to me! lf it was only Chiefwho left me, l wouldn't have cared. But you are exactly the same! lf l knew you still alive, l will have searched for you until l found you. lf l wanted to save myself, l would say the same thing, Jay. Tolonglah cakap apa-apa! Sit down, Jay. D. You think l didn't want to save you? Eveything l have done so far is only to save you! All l see is that you are having fun wearing a tux. Coming with a girl, probably on some kind of date. Dian, do you believe your little brother? Adakah saya menggangu? An_ra, awak tahu saya san0at sibuk. Apa yang saya mahu ada1ah demonstrasi senjata pemusnah yang sangat mahal ni. Ultra Virus _an Uemonstrasi kamu. Andra, do not go near her! Andra! What do you want from me, D? Do you want me to ask for forgiveness? Do you want me to say this is all my fault? Fine, it's all my fault. l'm sorry! Don't do this, D! See, he is still not worried about you. Eddie! Don't worry, Jay. l'm selling the antidote together with it. If you can get it. lt's okay, Jay. l'm going to let you live to see her die. We'll see il Chief still believes in you after this. Skodeng! Eddie has been infected! Track the virus, the antidote is with it! Go after the virus, get the antidote and send me Eddie's GPS now! This is my Mum's car, Jay. She is very soft but she will punch me if anything happens to her car! Skodeng! How could you shout at me like that, Jay? This is Skodeng. Where do you think you can run to? Cepat. Cepat. Faster. Get in! Jadi, macam mana nak aktifkan virus ni? Dengan ini. Finally people will know who Skodeng really is! l shall make my country proud! You're lucky nothing happened to my Mum's car! Misi selesai. No. Don't! Sangat menakjubkan! Orang saya akan suka Uengan benda ini. Senang berurusan dengan awak. Sama. Dian, don't you have something to do? Move! Apa? Hey! Orang saya cakap virus tu baru dicuri! Mana Dian? Kalau kau nak tahu, kau perlukan ini. Eddie! Open the door Eddie! Eddie! I can't, Jay. Tak mengapa. Hi, co-pilot! Eddie! Please open the door! - Eddie! - It's okay. l can't open it, Jay. You will get infected. Eddie! We've got the antidote! Takpe, Jay. Takpe. - Jay, Jay! - Ye? You would do the same thing if you were me, right? Eddie! Eddie! Bring her back, Jay. Eddie! Yes, l understand. Datuk Seri Skodeng and Eddie have followed our orders to assist Jay. But, Eddie was killed. We haven't been able to trace Dian. Only Jay can lead us to her. Make sure Skodeng continues to assist him. l understand, Sir. Okay. l had a feeling that you would come. Eddie is dead. l know. ln order to save lives, Jay. - She died because of me. - It's our duty. Untuk metindungi, Jay. l got my orders Irom the top. Because you are the only one who can lead us to Dian. And you are the only one who can expose Andra. Dian? Yes. You want to find Andra? We can inform HQ about this, Jay! We can shut down all airports. You can tell them yourself. We'll tell them together. End of story. - l just want to go home. - Eddie is dead, Jay! Almost all of your squad members are dead. lf l continue, even more will die. - l've had enough. - Yo_ve had enough? Then who was l talking to just now? A pole? Jay! l'm going to Chiefs house to tell him that l am done. Skodeng, where are you? - HQ. - l was at Chiers house, he's not there. l know. l am tracking the Commander now. HQ sent a squad to Andra's place but it has been cleared out. He's on the move. We have tracked the Commander to Ampang Road. You can cut them oH at P. Ramlee Road. They are heading towards the front of KLCC. We are closing the roads. Jay, they are heading to Tun Razak Road. Jay, don't worry. We'll get the Commander back. Terima, Jiman. Skodeng, awak ambil alih di sini. Akujadi bos? Wow! - You think you can escape this time? - Quiet! Hey! Hurry up! - Judo, squad's ETA, 1 minute. - Dad? l'm fine. Get Andra! This is an order, Judo!

D. - D. - Don't! - Don't do this to Dad, D. - Chief! - Not Dad. - Our father, D. Whatever happens, he's still our father, who raised us both. He left me. - You left me too! - l have never left you, D! Never! Let him go, D. Take me instead. D. Dad. Jangan! Dad tried to save you, D. He tried. But he is only human, we all make mistakes. Let's try to lix these mistakes. - Stop talking, Jay. - D. You are the only family l have. l don't want to lose you. l'm the one who failed to look after you, Dian. You don't have to involve Jay and the rest in this. lf you're angry with me, hate me, then just take it out on me, not the rest. l can accept whatever it is you want to do. l am willing to accept whatever you want to do, Dian. Look after Dad. lt's too late lor me. l love you, silly!
