About... The yearbook. Alright. Who wants to be in charge? - Hey, wake him up. - Yes. Tofide. Come on, wake up. Sorry. 0h, is it over already? You're all representatives, right? At least you could... Show a little enthusiasm. Come on, this meeting is for your yearbook. It's not like we want to. - Sir, it's a drag for you as well. - Shut up. Come on, let's get it done. I volunteer. You, suzuki? Yes. Alright. So, is everyone ok with suzuki? - Yes. - 0k. 10 pictures per class, for next week. 0k? And suzuki, can you stay a little longer? Sure. Suzuki's eyes are gaping holes. She's unsettling. A woman's holes since we have a picture each month... We could spread it all over here, like... - Are you listening? - I'm listening. "Suzuki" why did you volunteer? You don't really care, right? Nobody came up, we were wasting time. Suzuki, you often do that... You're a person of duty. I bet people often tell you they don't get you, right? They do. I see. I wonder... You're unexpectedly sharp. Huh? I thought you were incompetent. I'm not incompetent. I didn't even consider you as a choice. Well, whatever. Where was I. Ah, the pictures... - Sir. - What? Could you make me a child? - A child? - Yes. Huh? You like to have intercourse, right? - Intercourse? - You do like it, don't you? - Well, that's not... - It's a good deal... I want a child and you like intercourse. Right, that's a crime. What? I hate to be a virgin at 17, so... That's a lie... that's a lie. - I like you so much, I... - That's a lie too. - Come on, stop. - I'm... an alien. I've snatched a human body. My mission is to make a human child. I didn't see that coming. - I'm glad you get it. - I don't get anything. I'm busy now, try that with another teacher, 0k? 6 months till graduation... By the time my belly swells, I'll be gone. - Are you serious? - Yes. Your car is pretty rundown. I bought it with 10,000 yen I won at the pachinko parlour. Just switch on. Shall I do it? Well, it's a bit tricky. It's on. Are those alien powers? - That was easy to figure. - I see. That's useful. - So, what shall we do? - Intercourse, as we agreed to. Well, sure. - Ok, so let's go to a hotel or... - No, I can't wait. - Eh, here? - Why not? It's not that... - It saves time. - Wait, wait. Don't you think there's a better way? - Excuse me. - Wait. - What is it? - I'm not in the mood yet. Please touch me. If you don't mind. More. A hole? Suzuki? Suzu... So you're... An alien? I can't... I'm coming. It's no big deal. Sorry, I should not say that? No, it's fine. Just like smoking I guess. Hey... - Are you really an alien? - Yes, but my body is human. Can't you make kids with your alien powers? Sure. But the process is important. The love involved with the intercourse. I need to know about that. Hmm. But most of all, I wanted to know about sex. Now, you want to know about cigarettes? Right. This confirms I like useless stuff. Say... In case it didn't work, would you help me again? You said it's no big deal. But it wasn't too bad. Is that 0k? Hm, sure. Thank you for your help. I'm calling you now let's go have fun for a bit tonight, let's forget about time like the good old days snow is falling outside... Black holes Move. - This food will kill you. - Uh? Right. What's this? You're into that stuff? Could you make that a freebie? Sponging off a former student? Have you no pride? We were quite close. Well, I want my TV back. - Another time. - You bring it, I'd hate to go there. Okie dokie. You're great. Lowlife teacher. The mysteries of space Ah, I'm cold. Hmm, this picture isn't too bad, but... Hmm. The pictures over here seem more fun. Will that be all for today? Yes, that's all. Ah, wait. - What? - How was it? Eh? The results, for the baby. I can't know. With a human body it takes a month to know. Oh? One month later Sir. It didn't work. Would you mind if we try again? At the mandarin orchard. Oh yeah oh oh soul time, soul time I want to hug her tight, all night our eyes often meet, with that girl 0h oola oolala she pretends not to notice 0h oola oolala and I'm not that bothered either 0h oola oolala - Hey, wait a sec. - Pardon? It's just that, today... I want to do it differently... Like, with a mood. - You think so? - Yes, yes. Eh? No, I told you I'm busy today. Eh? You do it, mom. It's just stocking, you can do it yourself. The mysteries of space I love you I'm talking about you please don't make fun of me oh love - hey. - What? Why don't people do it like plants? Having to do all this is inefficient. Inefficient, huh? - Let's get started. - Wait, wait. Well... Let's try another position today. Like... Last time was a bit botched. - Can I help? - No, just stay still. Here it is. Eh? Suzuki? Hey. Hey. How is it? You don't really like it? I told you, it's not that bad. Could you, like... Well, how can I say... What should I do? Let me help. This feels so good. I'm coming. I'm coming. Doing this is inefficient. - Here. - You are a mystery. This ramen is good. It's convenient. Right. - You see, it's a basic human need. - What is? I mean... The feeling of a mutual need... That you need both parents to raise a child. Mutual, raise a child... Yeah. You really are a mystery. What is it? - You seem to enjoy the food. - Really? Well, it is delicious. - Suzukl -hm? - Do you have hobbies? - Not really. Usually people do, but you're not usual. - Is that so? - Yeah. Why don't we go some place next time? Hmm. I'd like that. Suzukl wait. Amazing. This feels so good. Ah, shit. For real? Why are you staring? It's... it's fine. Oh, oh, oh. Look you, see it. Wow, the net, the net. It's coming, it's coming. That's it, more, more. It's huge. Take a picture. Yes. Good, another. - Now here? - Yes, there. You try it next time. It's fun. Ok, I'll try. What are you gonna do now? I leave that to you. I love you I love you I'm talking about you please, don't make fun of me oh love we can't have intercourse today. Oh? - Is that right? - Yes. Why? I still need the results of last time. Doing it today could distort the test results. What do we do? You want me to take care of it? Hmm. Worst case, I can use my mouth. No, it's fine. Eh? It's just that... It's not just sex... It's more like, I want to hold you. It's hard to say. It's still intercourse. Sure, but still... The point is... Have you dated before? No, sir. You're my first. Are we dating? - Yes. - Why? Because I love you. Whatever. Sorry, I didn't know what to say. You don't have to apologize. - Sir, are you angry? - I'm not angry. Actually, let's have intercourse. Why? It's an emergency. I learned that in such a case, sex is the best. - Eh, when? - By observing you. And I read that sexual stimulation solves relationship problems. - No, it's fine. - Anyway... No, it's fine. Stop. I told you to stop. Alright then. You're a mystery. Do I drive you home? No, the mandarin orchard is fine, as always. - Something happen? - Nope. I don't care if you're an alcoholic. I want my TV back now. - Yeah, yeah. - Get it done. - I get it. - Watch your tone. I'll pick it up today. Huh? Say... You spent the day with one of your students. I saw you. Wait there, I'll bring it. Make it quick. You don't know how miserable I am. I'm just a store clerk who got dumped. What's your problem? Why do I have to get swayed around by you? Come on, look at me. Am I not good enough? - I didn't say that. - Why then? Why did you dump me? Why? Tell me. Huh? What are you doing? Shut up. Can't you see I'm miserable. Hey, what are you... Stop it. Come on, joji! You're wearing just that? You're always like that. Wait. I forgot something. - Hey you, wait there. - Excuse me. What's up with you? - Sorry for bothering you. - Huh? Can't you see you're rude? Stop fucking with me. Aren't you just a school girl? Yes. I'm talking to you. Can I go now? Suzuki. Suzuki. What is it? Sorry. About what? Eh, well about... You're allowed to be angry. It's not what you think, she came at me. I tried to resist. I'm not angry. Alrighty, good. We just have to give these to the company. - Good job. - Thank you. You worked hard for 3 months. - We did it. - Yeah, good job. - I'm tired. - Really... - Sir, I'm leaving the trash. - Sure. - See you, sir. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Suzukl yes? There's a new ramen shop at the station. Let's go. No, thank you. Oh? My mission is accomplished. Your mission? Yes, that. Really? Thank you for everything. I won't need your anymore. Who wants to be in charge? - Hey, wake him up. - Yes. Toride, come on, wake up. Ah, sorry. - On, is it over already? - Toride... You're all representatives, right? At least you could... Show some enthusiasm. Come on, this meeting is for your yearbook. It's not like we want to. - Sir, it's a drag for you as well. - Shut up. Come on, we need to get it done. Toride... Toride... Toride... Toride... Eh? One more. Oh, that's a great face. Hagimoto... Keep going, you pig. And that's how Mr. Murata became my pig. A woman's pig and without wishing others I‚Äù... But is that how the soul leaves the body? Or so you may think. Leaving a grudge after departing from this world. Using death is sinful and abominable... You're hagimoto kobato? Yes. What a cute name. It's like, you keep a small bird on your heart. Eh? Each name is a poem... A scenery revealed before one's eyes. Toride... Toride... Toride... Toride... Toride... Toride... Toride... Toride... T-Toride... I'm so... Hopeless. Hey. Hey what, stupid? Eh? You're not helpless. You want to date him, right? You just want his attention. What did you think of him earlier? It was hard on me. That's not true. Eh? You wanted to torture him. The pig is ignoring you... So you want him to squeal. Pig... So? When did you start this routine? Well, it's been a year. And I've even been stalking him recently. Yes. Hey, do it properly. - Yes. - That's your routine. I am doing it properly. It's just... I can't concentrate when you're watching. Your beloved toride's Jersey. Now you can concentrate. Smell it more. Toride... You're a lowlife! You really are a pig! - What? - 0h, nothing. What's up with you? You're creepy. He's weird. He was staring at myjunk. Someone recite this poem. Ok, miss hagimoto. Yes. - Rather than lamenting about my misfortunes... - What? Do your routine, pig. And without wishing others ill... But is that how the soul leaves the body? Or so you may think. Sinful and abominable... While alive... Those kinds of abominable things... Look at him. Make the rumored harshness of fate. To an unfeeling person... What? He's creepy. Should you ever confide. So I changed my mind... However, not being lost in my thoughts. Toride sweat a lot in this one. Guaranteed hard-on. You too. What? What are you doing, pig? You love toride, right? Why are you laughing? How sharp, I thought... For a pig. But you have a chance... You're in the same class... And in the representative group... You're even sitting close to him. You're in the same year. You're a girl. But... Look at me. I'm a man... I'm gay... I'm small and bald... Not a chance I could even talk to him. And if I touched him... He would find the mere contact disgusting. At least let me love him. Alright, I get it. Let it be your last routine today. Eh? But in return... What? Wait. Wait. - Don't you dare move. - Eh? Eh? Wait. You're getting hard. Sir. You hate me, right? Since you're gay, right? Does it feel good? You are a pig, indeed. Be still. My little piglet. I want you inside me. You can call me a pig... But I'm better off as a pig. Don't be rude to pigs. I can't help it... This is why I like you, sir... How you are both submissive and proud... Your honesty with your lust... Small and bald as you are... Even the fact that you don't like me... I like it all. All of you. I like you. I like you. If that was... Your motive... Why didn't you say so? I'm done... Obeying your orders. For me... Doing it with a woman... Is like doing it with a pig. You're rude to pigs too. You can have it. Listen everybody. The truth is... I kept a secret from you. What? What is it? He's bored with us. The fact is... I'm gay. What else is new? Nothing new. Everybody knew it. You knew? For a long time. Why didn't you tell me? - There's no way we could. - Yeah. Ah... I see. You're late. You knew it too, right? - That's cute. - I know right? You had to break the news. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir. Good morning. - Good morning, toride. - Good morning. Good morning. A pink sweater? Good morning. Nice t-shirt, toride. How can you see inside? Just button up your shirt. Good morning. Let's go. Good morning. By the way, I had the photos developed. Is that right? But most of them are shaky... There isn't much to see. I had a good laugh. You're gonna let him be cocky? I was looking forward to seeing the faces I made. Step up your game. Then we'll let him see what face he makes. But, there were other pictures too. Sir, are you free after class? Well, sure. Say. You really want me to hide in there? Yes. But not just yet. He's coming. Sir, quick, hide inside. Quick. Tonde. Look at me. Please, look at me. Do you like it? Hagimoto. Hagimoto. - Here? - Yes. I'm going in. Are you ok doing it with me? Yes. Hagimoto. Hagimoto. Hagimoto. Hagimoto. Let's do it here. You ready? Hagimoto. Ah, I'm coming. You're really hopeless. You hate me, right? I do hate you. Then hate me some more. You can hate me all you want. And then... I'll torture you even more. And we'll keep doing that forever. Forever... Stop... You see... Sir, only I know... Exactly how you feel. How would you know? - Because I like you. - I told you to stop. You can't know how I feel. Why can't I know? - You bald pig. - I'm not a pig. Baldy. Pig. Die. Stop. - You're hagimoto kobato? - Yes. What a cute name. It's like, you keep a small bird on your heart. Iso like him... I so want him to look at me. Hagimoto? Are you ok? I'm so sorry. You have such a bump. Are you ok? Let's go to the hospital. I'm fine. But look at you... I told you I'm fine. I'm so sorry. You should go now. I didn't know what to do with these. Take them back. Demon. Why? Why? Hey, you! You can't be here. Don't go. I like you with the short hair. While you, sir, don't have much hair to cut. I do have haircuts. I even had one yesterday. Graduation 2014 shizuoka prefecture how is your head? Yes, it was just a bump. I'm relieved. Sir... I like you. I know I was mean... But sincerely... Enough with that. I've had... Those kinds of feelings before too. It's been a long time... Since I've had that kind of rush. Really? See... Once you graduate... You'll leave all this behind. You'll forget about me. Next year I'll be a distant memory. You think so? I know so. Because, you see... The world is vast. Through the gardens of education... These years feel short. When you think about it, this time... Flew by. The time to part... Is now. Goodbye. Yes. More. I'm coming. Hey. Hey. It's your phone. What happened? Hey, tell me. Gotta go. - This late? - Yes. - I work early tomorrow, I can't stay. - Yeah, sure. Hey, can I come back tomorrow? Mandarin orchard. The mandarin orchard? What? Of all times. Damn car. You want to hold her? Ah, yes. She's not crying. Maybe she knows... That you are her father. Is something wrong? Suzuki, what are we going to do? - It's none of your... - Sure it is. Let's live together. Because we made a child? I don't know. As I said... You're a mystery. But... Now I feel like... I understand those feelings a little better. Suzukl and now... I have to go back there. No, but... Yes. My mission ends here. Who cares... About that? Stay with me. Stay here with me. They came to fetch me. I kept them waiting long enough. Being with you... Wasn't too bad. One year later sir. Ah, you scared me. That's last year's yearbook. Yes. They were such a successful year. Sir. We count on you this year too. - No way. - Eh? It's just that they were working hard. There's toride. He was so cute. - Still obsessed with that kid? - Eh? What's wrong with that? My feelings are my own. No one can take them away from me. I like that about you... You're sincere. What is it? Eh? No, it's nothing. Tell me, what was her name? Eh? Suzuki sachiko, right? Right, suzuki. What? No, no. It's just... I had totally forgotten about her. A beauty, but so aloof. I never even saw her smile. Yes, a total lack of personality. That brings back memories.
