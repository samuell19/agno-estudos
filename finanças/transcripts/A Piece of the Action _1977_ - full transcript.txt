CLASS, YOUR PERSONAL APPEARANCE-- THAT INCLUDES ALERTNESS AND CONCENTRATION. DENISE, YOU BE THE APPLICANT. AND, BARBARA... YOU CONDUCT THE INTERVIEW. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS DENISE ORVILLE. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? I TOLD YOU. WHY DO YOU WANT TO WORK HERE? WHAT'S YOUR ADDRESS, YOUR AGE, YOUR MAMA'S NAME, YOUR SEXUAL PREFERENCES? STOP IT! HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO GET ANYTHING IF YOU CANNOT KEEP YOUR MIND ON IT FOR ONE MINUTE? YOU HAVE THE ATTENTION SPAN OF A 5-YEAR-OLD. TIME, DAMN IT. WHAT? TIME OUT. BAD-MOUTHING ME ABOUT MY ATTENTION SPAN. I'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION. THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG. I PAID ENOUGH ATTENTION TO PEEP YOUR GAME, MISS THOMAS. SO DON'T GIVE ME ALL THAT BULLSHIT. YOU'RE SHUCKIN'. I AIN'T NEVER GOIN' TO GET NO DAMN JOB, NOT WITH PEOPLE LIKE YOU AROUND. I BEG YOUR PARDON? YOU AIN'T DEAF. I SAID, IF WE ALL GET JOBS, IT'LL BLOW YOUR GAME. YEAH, GAME. ALL YOU MIDDLE-CLASS, BOURGIE-ASS NIGGERS. I KNOW WHERE YOU COMIN' FROM. ALL OF Y'ALL GOT THE JOBS, AND YOU MAKIN' YOUR MONEY OFF OF US. RIGHT ON. ADMINISTERING TO YOUR LESSER BROTHERS AND SISTERS. ALL US POOR, DEPRIVED, GHETTO CHILDREN... SHIT! WHOO! WHAT YOU HIGH-TONED NIGGERS MAKE FOR THIS JIVE-ASS NUMBER YOU RUNNIN' DOWN ON US, HUH? 15,000? AND MR. DURRELL... 15, 20,000? WELL, IF IT WASN'T FOR NIGGERS LIKE US, Y'ALL WOULDN'T MAKE SHIT! AND WHERE Y'ALL LIVE, HUH? NOT AROUND HERE, I BET YOU THAT. AM I RIGHT OR WRONG? SO, DON'T BLOW SMOKE UP MY ASS ABOUT NO FREAKIN' JOB. WHOO! MY MAMA DIDN'T RAISE NO FOOLS. NOW, I GOT ENOUGH ATTENTION SPAN TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENIN'. WHAT'S HAPPENIN' IS I CAN RECOGNIZE A POVERTY PIMP WHEN I SEE ONE. WHAT'S HAPPENIN' IS BOURGEOIS BULLSHIT. BARBARA, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ME ON SOME KIND OF MIDDLE-CLASS GUILT. I WENT TO SCHOOL, BARBARA. I PUT IN MY TIME, AND I PAID MY DUES. I WENT TO SCHOOL, BARBARA! IT WAS HARD WORK... AND I WORKED HARD. MY ASS BLEEDS FOR YOU. SO, NOW YOU WORK HARD ON YOUR GAME OF UNDERPRIVILEGED NIGGERS. CAN YOU DO THE WORK? ARE YOU DEPENDABLE? CAN YOU GET ALONG WELL WITH OTHERS? SHIT! CAN YOU DO THE WORK? NOW, YOU PUT YOUR ATTENTION SPAN TO THAT WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR 15,000 AND YOUR TIGHT-ASS SELF BACK TO YOUR "FIRST NEGRO IN MY BLOCK" NEIGHBORHOOD... AND YOUR ELECTRIC VIBRATOR. OOH! NOW, WHAT YOU NEED IS A MAN... YEAH! OR SOMEBODY. WHATEVER GETS YOU THROUGH THE NIGHT. THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY TO ME. EVEN TO IMPLY SUCH UNTRUTHS... IS SO U-U-UNFAIR. OH. YOU MEAN, LIKE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY'S ATTENTION SPAN? RIGHT ON! YAY! I DIDN'T START THAT. I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, PLAYING HER GAME. SHE HAD NO CALL TALKING ABOUT HOW DUMB WE ARE. HEY... BARBARA JUST GOT MAD AND WENT FOR THAT MIDDLE-CLASS SORE SPOT. SHE'S RIGHT. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING MIDDLE-CLASS. THE POINT IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING. BUT THAT'S WHAT I DO, YOU KNOW. I DO MAKE MY LIVING FROM THEIR MISERY. YOU'RE WORKING FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR THEM-- BARBARA INCLUDED. I GIVE HER CREDIT. BARBARA'S BRIGHT. JOHN IS SHARP. BUT MOST OF THESE KIDS... THE TRAGEDY IS THE SCHOOL SYSTEM HAS DONE A ROTTEN JOB. IT HASN'T TAUGHT THE CHILDREN-- ESPECIALLY GHETTO CHILDREN-- HOW TO THINK THROUGH A PROBLEM, HOW TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, AND HOW TO PICK THE RIGHT TOOLS TO SOLVE IT. BECAUSE LIFE IS A SERIES OF PROBLEMS. I THINK THE STREET'S TEACHING THEM HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. I MEAN, NOT ABOUT A JOB MAYBE, BUT ABOUT HUSTLING... TO SURVIVE. YOU KNOW? WELL, MYSELF... I KNOW ABOUT THAT. BUT THESE KIDS DON'T KNOW JOBS OR HUSTLING. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE HERE. ANYWAY, STREET HUSTLING IS NOT AN ACTION. IT'S A REACTION. IT'S ACCEPTING SECOND-CLASS STATUS. STILL, THE WHOLE QUESTION OF FINDING JOBS FOR THEM GETS TO ME. THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN GOTTEN TO... GIVEN THE PROPER DIRECTION WHEN THEY WERE 3, 4, 5. AND HERE THEY ARE AT 17, 18, AND HERE WE ARE... WITH A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS, TRYING TO CLEAN UP THE DAMAGE, THE MESS, THE SCHOOLS HAVE SPENT MILLIONS TO MAKE. MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. MAYBE IT IS TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE. BUT THEN... THERE MUST BE SOME OTHER... A DIFFERENT KIND OF APPROACH. MR. DURRELL, THEY NEED SO MUCH. NOW, I'M A WOMAN. I'M NOT A VERY STRONG WOMAN... AND YOU'RE A MAN AND... YOU'RE BLACK AND SUCCESSFUL. WELL, YOU COULD... WHATEVER YOU COULD COME UP WITH... TRY. TRY, PLEASE. SARAH... YOU'RE GOOD PEOPLE. ALL RIGHT. ANYBODY SEEN MR. DURRELL? ANYBODY SEEN MR. DURRELL? WHAT ABOUT MISS THOMAS? THEY KEEPIN' IN PRACTICE WALKIN' ON WATER. YEAH, THAT'S FUNNY. NOW, WHERE DID THEY GO? MISS THOMAS WENT ONE-ON-ONE WITH BARBARA AND GOT HER ASS WASTED. SHE SPLIT. MR. DURRELL WENT AFTER HER. AND YOUR ASS IS NEXT. HEY, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU. AH, MR. THEODORE. HOW ARE YOU TODAY? FINE, MR. DURRELL. AND YOU GENTLEMEN? VERY WELL, THANK YOU. VERY WELL. I WENT TO THE MEETING. NOTHING. BEAUTIFUL. WHERE DO WE GO NOW? WE CHECK ALL THE RECORDS, FIND OUT THE NAMES OF THE ALTERNATE BOARD MEMBERS, THE FORMER BOARD MEMBERS, THE CONSULTANTS, AND THE ADVISORS. HIS NAME'S GOT TO BE THERE. HOW YOU GOING TO GET THOSE RECORDS? YOU MEAN HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THEM? WE'RE GOING TO HIT THE SAFE IN MISS FRENCH'S OFFICE. THE SAFE? DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IT'S A-105 IPSWICH. CAKE BOX. I SEE. YOU SEE WHAT? YOU SEE WHAT? NOTHING. JUST I SEE. WELL, WHEN ARE WE GOING TO "HIT" THE SAFE? TONIGHT. IT'S GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS TO RUN THESE NAMES DOWN. THE SOONER THE BETTER. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN SURVIVE SIX WEEKS WITH THOSE TEENAGE GORILLAS. SIX DAYS WITH THEM IS ENOUGH TO CURL YOUR NAPS. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE FIRE ESCAPE? HOW MUCH DID YOU GET UP THERE? I SAID HOW MUCH DID YOU GET UP THERE? I WANT TO DECIDE ON OUR CUT. I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO MUG US. CAN YOU FIGHT? WE'LL KNOW IN A MINUTE. WHAT GOOD IS THIS?
