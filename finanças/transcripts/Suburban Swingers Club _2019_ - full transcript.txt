- You looking forward to finally decorating your own house? - Yeah. Looking forward to a whole new set of furniture too. - Yeah, well, like I said, go on a shopping spree and make this house the most beautiful house on the block. - I will. But first we have to get it painted, right? - Yeah. That should be fun. - This is one swanky neighborhood. - Kat! Yay! You made it! - Of course. What's the point of having a sister if she's not going to help you unpack? - Agree. - And from the looks of it, you need all the help you can get. - Yeah. - This place is gigantic. Yeah, well, you can't live in a dingy old condo forever. - You can take that one. - This isn't too heavy. - Okay, go ahead. - Oh, my gosh. - I'll find a spot for those later. - Wow. Look at this. - Isn't this amazing? - Yes. - These hardwood floors... is this marble? - No, it's quartz, but close. Look at this. Six ranges, all right? Stainless steel, white. Come here, check this out. - Grant, this is nice. - Double oven. Stainless steel also. Yeah, go ahead and put that over by the fireplace right over here. - I cannot wait to cook over here. - Oh, wait till you see the outside. - Are you serious? There's more? - Ta-da! - This is pretty awesome. You guys definitely need to get a dog. And I need to be the official puppy-sitter. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, one step at a time, okay? - Wow. - That must have been left here by the previous owners. I am so sorry. Hey, can we get someone to get those toys out of here, please? - How's Grant handling everything? - He has his way. - Okay. So, I guess things are getting better? I don't know. Ever since we lost the baby, Grant just wants me to move on. But I don't know if I can. Honestly, Kat, I don't know if things are ever going to be the same between us. I am so sorry. Come here. - Oh, my gosh. - Yes, of course I'm here for you. Come on. No, we have to move on this deposition. - Grant! - Okay, so, what you got to do is-- - Grant! ♪ ♪ - Knock, knock! Lori? Oh! - Oh. Hello. - I'm sorry. Uh, I'm Rachel. We met at the Christmas party last year. - Rachel. - We live three houses down. We're neighbors. - Yeah, Grant told me. - Oh, my, you certainly have a room with a view, don't you? That's Noah Cranor. God, he likes to show off, doesn't he? - Seems that way. - Want me to introduce you guys? - Oh, no. Gosh, I've got my hands full right now. - Oh, yes. I remember how it was when we first moved in. It stresses me out just thinking about it, which is why I brought you this. - You didn't have to do that. - Well, it's just a little housewarming I thought we'd enjoy tonight over dinner at our place. - Dinner? You don't have to go through that trouble, really. - It's really no trouble. See you at 6:00? - All right. Thank you. Okay. - So, Lori, have you met any of the other neighbors? - She certainly has. She met Noah. - Oh, Noah. Who's Noah? - Noah Cranor. He owns the house across the street from you guys. He's always working in his garage, usually with his shirt off. - You met that guy? - I didn't actually meet him. I just saw him in the garage, working. - Mm-hmm. - He does carpentry and woodworking in his garage as a hobby. - Hmm. - Yeah, he did our gazebo out back. You should check it out. - He's really good with his hands. - Well, you know, we're thinking about putting a deck out by our pool. Right, babe? I mean, maybe you can run some ideas by him. - Sure. - Cheers. Cheers. - The first time we saw this neighborhood, we just absolutely fell in love with it. The golf course here is amazing. You can't see it now, but in the daytime it's beautiful. I can't wait for you to play the back nine. - Yeah, I can't wait. - Looks like they're becoming fast friends. Yeah, she seems happy. That makes me happy. - So, um, what's going on between you two? - What do you mean? - Come on. - Is it that obvious? - Yeah. It's complicated. Lost a baby last year. Five months pregnant. Things haven't been the same since. We've just kind of drifted apart. I thought maybe buying the house might change things, but, you know, I don't know. - Sorry to hear about that. - Thanks. - But... I might have just the answer to your problem. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Do tell. - It's a little different. So you have to keep an open mind. - He is very proper and particular... - So, what do you think of Derek and Rachel? - They seem really nice. - Okay. - Yeah. - Yeah, I think we could become good friends. - Yeah. - Ooh, relax. It's just me. What's so interesting out there? - Just looking at the sky. So many stars out there. Our first night in our new house. Derek and Rachel invited us to a party on Friday. - Really? So soon? - Mm-hmm. Well, except this is at another couple's house. It's three streets away. I guess this group gets together, like, once a month. Always the same people. It's a very private thing. - Why is it so private? - This group of people is... they have certain interests. - Okay. Um... they like to share intimate experiences with each other. Romantic experiences. - Are you telling me that Derek and Rachel are swingers? And that they have invited us to a swinger party? - Yeah. And, look, before you say no, I want you to think about it. - You are considering this. I cannot believe this. Derek blindsided me with this today, and I had the same reaction you did. And then I thought about it-- - About sleeping with Rachel? Is that what this is about? - No, that if we open up our relationship, it'll be good for us. You and I both know that things have been difficult. Ever since we lost the... we have grown apart. - I know. I'm sorry, I'm just... I'm still dealing with it. - I know. But I think that this is a way for us to come back together. It worked out for Derek and Rachel. - How? - Look, they were in a bad spot a couple of years ago, just like us. Then they went to this thing, and it saved their marriage. Ask Rachel. - No. I am not going to ask Rachel something like that. And, honestly, I cannot believe that you're actually considering this. - Why not? - Because it's cheating. - It is not cheating if both of us are involved. And we get to pick the boundaries here. - Wow. So you have just already made up your mind about this. Unbelievable. - No. We're just talking. - Why would I want to sleep with another man? I love you. - And I love you too. But this is something that we can experience together. I'll be thinking about you, and you'll be thinking about me. - Right, you'll be having sex with another woman, thinking about me? - Yes. - I don't know. It all sounds risky. Something could happen. So many things could happen. - Honey, I promise, nothing bad is going to happen. I just want us to come back together again. The way we used to be. - I want that too. - Then I think at least we should give this a try. I mean, nothing else has seemed to work. - I could never do this. I'm sorry. - So that's your answer? - That's my answer. - Okay. - So, what now? Where are you going? - I have some work I have to do. - Really? - Good night. I'll see you in the morning. - Hey, honey. About last night... - It's okay. Let's just forget about it. Oh, uh, I got to work late, so... - What about dinner? - I'll just pick something up. How's the run? - Good. - I'm Noah. I live just across the street from you. - I'm Lori. I... saw you. In the garage. My husband is Grant. - How was the first night in the house? - Quiet. Not like the city at all. It's like crickets in a star-filled sky. - Lots of other things to look at too. I'm sure we'll see each other around. You have a good run. - Wow, who knew the burbs were so exciting? What did the guys look like? Are they cute? - Kat, this is not a college dorm, okay? These are married men. - Well, they make the best lovers. I mean, so I've heard. I--I don't know. I feel like Grant is so set on this that if I don't do it, I risk losing him. - So you're open to the idea? Look, if he wanted to cheat on you, he'd just do it behind your back. He's actually empowering you. He's putting you in charge, letting you set the ground rules. I think it's kind of sweet. You should just try it, see how it goes. And if you don't like it, if you're uncomfortable, don't do it again, forget it. - But these people are my neighbors, you know? I feel like once we do it, there's no going back. Plus, what if he likes it and I don't? - Then it was never about the two of you. It was just about him getting permission to sleep with the bimbo down the street. And if that's the case, good riddance. Look, it might all work out just like he said. It might even bring you two closer together. And save your marriage. At least think about it. Lori? - Hey. - I apologize for last night. I don't know what I was thinking. - You want to save our marriage by any means necessary. - Lori, I-- - I'll do it. - What? - These are the rules. First, we both have to approve each other's partners. I agree on yours, you agree on mine. - Okay. - Second, either one of us can veto each other's involvement at any time. No questions asked. No turning back. Third, when we're with other people, you'll be thinking of me and I'll be thinking of you. - Grant and Lori. I am so glad you could make it. This is our host, Victoria Pope. - Rachel's been raving about you guys. Welcome to my home. First things first. - Oh. - Everyone is so excited to meet you. Let me show you around. I think you'll see we're kind of like an extended family here. This is my husband, Roger Pope. He's a real estate developer working on revamping the river walk. Darling. - Yes? - Lori and Grant, our new members. - Ah. Welcome to our home. - Thank you for having us. - It's so nice to see new faces. - The place is amazing. Wait till you see the rest of it. - Oh, my gosh, the river walk. What a great project. Congratulations. - Well, thank you so much. It's been a long, long process. - Welcome, everyone. Welcome. We all know these articles. The rules we've sworn to uphold. That we will be open with one another. That we will not withhold. There is no shame. Only our secrets... in our circle of trust. Mario Ramis. Perfect match. Lori? Close your eyes. Noah Cranor. Splendid. Carmen. Roger. - Love you. - Have fun, darling. - How are you? - Giselle. - Hmm. - Grant Malick. - Hi, I'm Giselle. - Hi. - I'm nervous. - Don't be. We can wait. ♪ ♪ She wears too much perfume. - Who? - Giselle. I can smell it on you. - I'm sorry. Did you think of me? - Yes. Did you think of me? - Oh, yeah. ♪ ♪ Good morning, honey. - Good morning. Is that good news? - Potentially. Rachel's client texted me, and she wants to meet this morning about ideas for her house. - That's fantastic. - Yeah. - It looks like I have to go out of town to San Diego for a deposition later on this week. Then afterwards I have to meet some new clients for dinner. So I think I'm going to have to stay the night. - Oh, honey, you know how much I hate staying home alone at night. Especially in a big house like this. - It is big, but it's also safe. There is no crime for miles around. Welcome to suburbia. Get used to it. Good luck today. - Thank you. - I know you'll get the job. - Thank you. - Good morning, neighbors. - Hey, Noah. - Hey. Sorry we didn't get a chance to talk more last night, buddy. - Oh, uh, yeah. Me too. - Why don't you come over to my house for dinner tonight. - Tonight? - Uh-huh. - Oh, tonight. Don't we have that... that thing? - No. No, we're free. We're good. - Great. 6:30? - Yeah. Bring your appetite. - Have fun at work now, guys. - Babe, why did you just agree to dinner? - Why not? - Because it's awkward. - Babe, we can't hide from our neighbors because it's awkward. This is what we signed up for when we opened our marriage. Look, if we stand together and we face our fears together, we will grow together. Let me know how today goes. Okay? - So, how's the steak? Is it overcooked? - No, it was so good. Right, honey? - So good. Great. - Oh, good, I'm glad I just didn't ruin them. - So, how long have you guys lived in the neighborhood? - Five years, more or less. We love it up here. - When did you guys... I don't know... join the group? Is it okay to ask that? - Sure. There's nothing to hide here. It was a couple of years ago. Um, Victoria asked me to do some work on her house, and one thing led to another. Here we are. Hey, you're an interior designer. - Yes. - Can I show you something? - Sure, yeah. - The coffee table. Come here. - All right. - So you can be completely honest. - Okay. - Is it ugly? - Oh, my gosh, you made this? - Yeah. - I love it. I mean, it's very simple, but it's masculine. - That's me, I guess. Simple and masculine. - I like it. I hear that you also build decks, is that true? - Word gets around. - Well, we were thinking about adding a deck to our backyard. - I can come take a look. - Really? - Of course. - Oh, that's great. - I'm sorry about tonight. - It wasn't that bad. - He couldn't take his eyes off of you. - Really? - You didn't notice? - Were you jealous? - I mean, yeah, a little. Maybe. - You're kind of cute when you're jealous. Just so you know, you have nothing to worry about. - Yeah. I think we should stay away from Noah for a while. And he's definitely off the approved list. Right? - Yeah. Right. Who is it? It's Rachel's client, Miss Kupur. She wants to work with me. She's giving me the job. - Congratulations. That's great. - Such a relief. - Oh, my gosh. I'm so happy for you. Mm, I'm so proud of you. Everything's falling into place. What do you think of Noah and Olivia? - They're an interesting couple. She never says much, and he never shuts up. - I think he likes Lori. - Noah flirts with all the wives. It's his thing. I don't know how Olivia puts up with him. - Yeah, well, you never know what goes on in a relationship. - Speaking of, Rachel told me that Giselle mentioned you're helping her out with some legal work? - No, no, I'm just giving her some legal advice. - Okay, well, here's my advice. Giselle can be trouble. All right, she's... she's a lot of fun, but she's miserable in her marriage. Sometimes she can't separate what happens at the parties from her real life. - Okay. Point taken. - Well, have a great day at work. - I like the way that sounds. Yeah, me too. - I'll call you later. - Okay. Bye. - Oh, my God. - Car trouble? - Yeah, I guess. I mean, it was working fine yesterday. - Want me to take a look? - No, no, no. You really don't have to do that. - It's my pleasure. Pop the hood. - Um... how do I do that? I got you. Alternator seems okay. Maybe loose wire. Let's try that. Magic. - Oh, my gosh, thank you so much. - No problem. But, uh... - Oh, my gosh. Whoopee. Look, I got to... so you got to... can I get my things...? - Oh, of course. - Thanks again. Noah. Oh, my God, you scared me. Wait, how did... how did you get in here? - Door was open. - What are you doing here? - I thought you wanted this. - Wanted what? Stop. This isn't right. - What's the matter? - I'm married. - Yeah, you were married the other night too. - That was different. - No, it wasn't. We had a connection. You felt it then, and you feel it now. You don't have to pretend with me. I'm all yours. - Stop. I'll scream. I'll call the police. - Now, what was all that at dinner the other night, huh? - I was admiring your furniture. Olivia. - Sorry to bother you, Lori. Have you seen Noah this morning? - I... I saw him a few minutes ago in your garage. - Well, he's gone. I can't find him. Did he come over here by any chance? - No. Why would he come here? - Just thought I'd check. - Well, I, um... wish I could stay and chat, but I'm running late for work, so... - Won't keep you then. - Okay. Noah? ♪ ♪ Hi, Miss Kupur. Yes, I'm so sorry. I'm leaving right now. - Okay. Bye. - Okay, I'll see you soon. ♪ ♪ Hey. Oh, my God. - You scared me. What are you doing with all the lights off? - I wanted to surprise you. - What are you talking about? - Your new client. - Oh, God. You're lucky I didn't bash you over the head with this thing. Mm. - Promise me that you'll get the alarm installed. - Yes, I promise. - Okay. - Come with me. - Cheers. - Cheers. - So, how are you feeling about things? About us? - Really good. - Me too. Derek and Rachel invited us to another party. - I'm not comfortable going back. - I thought you enjoyed it. - Actually, no. And now that things are going good between us, I mean, what's the purpose? - Well, I mean, we might be able to take our relationship to an even deeper level. - Babe, we tried it once. I say we just move on. Besides, I don't need those people to get to a deeper level. - Well, it's just that those people know us. I mean, what are they going to say? - I'm sure that people have left the circle before. Besides, you made a commitment to me before we started this. We both did. If anyone wants to stop, we stop. Lori, it's just... the other night, I saw something in you that I thought was gone. I saw the woman that I fell in love with. I know you felt it too. I just don't want to lose you again. And you won't lose me. Things are on a roll now. We just have to remember to check in with each other. Okay. - This would be perfect across from the fireplace. - It's nice, right? And I think this one would pair really well with it. It's the same designer. - I don't know. It feels too dated. - That's fair. There's another one I wanted you to see. It's right... - Oh, that one looks nice. - Are you serious? What are you doing here? - I wanted to get some fresh ideas for a chair I'm building. - I am working. Okay? You need to leave. - I got you something. It's an apology for the way I acted earlier. - Noah, I don't want anything from you. - Open it, please. - It's handcuffs. I made them myself. - Is this some kind of joke? - Oh, that depends how we use them. - Wow, you have no filter, do you? Noah, everything isn't about you, okay? - And what about the other day? You let me kiss you. I think that was about you. And I know you enjoyed it. - I told you that that was wrong. - It didn't feel wrong. - Look, you need to go. - Lori? I didn't know. I'm sorry. - Oh, no, Miss Kupur. This is-- - Noah. - Hello, Noah. - I'm Lori's neighbor. We just ran into each other. - Mm-hmm. - Actually, my wife and I are big fans of her work. She's offered to help us with our bedroom. We're opening it up, adding some new things. - That sounds nice. Pleased to meet you. I wanted to ask you what you thought about that table over there. - Okay, I'll be right there, Miss Kupur. If you don't leave right now, I'm going to call the police. - And what are you going to tell them? You ran into your friendly neighbor at the furniture store? - I think we have done it. You managed to put together the perfect set. - Everything is going to look really great. Next we'll talk flooring, okay? We have a lot to do. - Yes. Hello? - Did you like our video? - Noah, you need to leave me alone. - Thanks again, Lori. Have a good day. - Thanks, you too. Bye-bye, Miss Kupur. - Meet me at the Villa Serena Inn, Room 201. One hour, or that video goes out to all of your clients. - How? You don't even have my client list. - When I was in your house earlier, I forwarded your laptop address book to my account. How's your mom in Ohio doing? If you don't show up, that video goes to everyone on your list. Everyone. And I'll tell Grant how you invited me out for a drink after I helped fix your car. - You're sick. - Make your decision. The clock is ticking, and I'm losing my patience. - Okay. Come on, Grant. Pick up, pick up. Please pick up. - This is Grant Malick... - Damn it. - You're early. - Sorry about before. I was just so stressed. You know you don't have to work so hard to get me. - I knew you'd come around. - Ah. Before we get too far ahead of ourselves... - What about the video? - I'm not worried about the video. I am more concerned with these. - Now that's more like it. - You know what turns me on? - Mm-hmm. - A man who can be vulnerable. Are you strong enough to be vulnerable with me? Lie back. - Oh! - You think you can blackmail me? Ruin my career? What's wrong with you? - What's the passcode? - I don't know. - I deleted it. Are there any more copies? - No. - How do I know? - I guess we're just going to have to trust each other. What, are you just going to leave me here? Come on, this is silly. Come on, this is crazy. Damn it! Untie me. - If you ever pull anything like this ever again, I'm going to post this photo on the Neighborhood Watch site for everyone to see. Do you understand? Stay away from me. - Lori, are you okay? - No. - What happened? - Where were you today? - I was at work. - Well, why didn't you answer your phone? Why didn't you have it turned on? Every time I called you, it went straight to voicemail. - I am so sorry. I was in and out of meetings all day. And you know that room gets terrible cell phone reception. What happened? Is it the job? What happened? - I thought I could take care of it myself. - What are you talking about? - Babe, it's Noah. - Noah? - You saw how he was at dinner the other night. Well, it's gotten worse. He won't leave me alone. He's been showing up here at the house. - Did he hurt you? - No, but... he followed me to the furniture store today while I was working. He humiliated me. He tried to blackmail me. And he threatened me. - That son of a bitch! - Grant, wait. Grant... Grant, wait. Grant. Grant! - You want to harass someone? Try me. Let's see how far you get. - Bad day at work, Grant? - No, it's you. You're stalking my wife. Are you insane? - Now, what exactly am I accused of doing? - Noah, you followed me to the store today, and you know it. - Are you sure you told him the whole story? You really want to get into this? - No, you are out of line. - Lori, your Boy Scout here is obviously the jealous type. Maybe you guys should rethink the whole circle thing. It's not for everybody. - Stay away from Lori. - Grant, I thought we were friends. - Come on, let's just go. - You should listen to your wife. - If you go near my wife again, I will kill you. Do you understand that? - Grant, please, come on. - What? - Look, I can cancel my work trip if you're worried about him. - No. I really don't want you to have to do that. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I called Kat, and she's going to come stay with me. - That's great. Makes me feel a lot better. Um, look, everyone knows about Noah now in the neighborhood, so he would be absolutely stupid to try anything else. Do you know where my cell phone charger is? Never--never mind. I know where it is. ♪ ♪ - So I'll be in San Diego, the deposition around 3:00. And then after that I have a work meeting. - Okay. Drive safely. I'll miss you. - I'll miss you too. Are you sure you're going to be okay? - Yeah. Just go. - Okay. - I'll be fine. - I love you. - I love you too. - Hey, sissy. Are you here? I was just about to open up a bottle of wine. Where are you? - I am so sorry. I won't be able to come over tonight. - Wait, what? Are you serious? - It's a long story. I got roped into taking care of my neighbor's kid. She had to rush her mom to the hospital, and... - Okay. - Are you going to be all right? Maybe you can just stay at a hotel. - No, I'm not going to let that jerk run me out of my own house. - I don't blame you. Well, I'll check on you in a little bit, okay? Be safe. - All right. - I love you. - Bye. - Bye. ♪ ♪ - Hey, babe. I was just about ready to call you. - Something's wrong. - Lori? - I don't feel well. Help me. - Lori? Lori! Are you there? - Shh. - Grant? - Honey. - Grant... - It's okay. - Grant, where is he? Is he still here? - Who? - Noah. - Noah? - He was here. Last night. In the kitchen. - Wait, wait, slow down. Noah--Noah was here? - Grant, I saw him in the kitchen, and then I must have passed out. - Honey, when I got home, there was no one in the house except you, and you were asleep on the couch. - Well, then how did I get up here? - Well, I brought you up here. I tucked you into bed. I just didn't have the heart to wake you up. - You. You were there too. - W-W-What do you mean? - I saw you last night. - Hmm. Well, that sounds like a really bad dream. And it's not surprising, because you, you know, have kind of been through a lot lately. - What happened to your hand? - I... I cut it on the bushes on the side of the house. - And what were you doing on the side of the house? - I was taking the trash cans out to the street. It's trash day. Look, I'll tell you what, honey. Why don't I make you a cup of coffee. And after a cup of coffee, I'm sure your head's going to clear. And then you'll feel better, okay? Hey, babe. What are you doing? - What happened to the rug? - Oh, spilled wine all over it last night. So I tossed it. It's okay, we'll get another one. No wonder why you passed out. It looks like you drank the whole bottle. - No. I only had one glass. And right before I passed out, I saw Noah. He was standing right there in the kitchen. That's the last thing I remember... until I woke up again and saw you. - Babe, you've been under a lot of stress lately. I mean, you're starting to imagine things. - Grant, I know what I saw, okay? I wasn't dreaming. - Honey, I swear to you, okay? When I came home last night, there was no one in the house except you and me. I'm late for a meeting. Look, I think you should go upstairs and you should rest today. Okay? Are you going to be okay? - Yeah. - Okay. Oh, uh, I did call the alarm company, and they will be here on Friday. - Thank you. - Get some rest. Giselle. - Lori? Lori, I need your help. Lori, thank God. Open the door. - What's wrong? - It's about Noah. - What about him? - He's missing. - What do you mean, missing? - He didn't come home last night. That's not like him. And I found his wallet and his keys, and his phone in the house. I'm worried that something happened to him. - Okay, when is the last time that you saw him? - Yesterday morning. I left, and when I came back, he was gone. Did you happen to see him at all yesterday? - No. Why would I have seen him? - I don't know. I'm asking everyone. I have to go call the police. File a missing persons report. I'm sorry I bothered you. I'll call Rachel. Maybe she saw something. - It's definitely not mine. I hate charms, you know that. Maybe it belonged to the people that used to live there before. - No, it wasn't there when we moved in. - And you said a kitchen knife is missing. - Yeah. - So, what are you thinking? That Noah was stabbed and that Grant did it? And he had an accomplice? - Well, I smelled cheap perfume on Grant's shirt, and it was the same kind of cheap perfume that I smelled on Giselle a few days ago. - Wait, the woman he... You think they did it together? - I don't know. Hell, I don't even know if Noah's really dead. All I know is that something horrible happened to me and to him last night. - So why not go to the police? - What am I supposed to say? That I think my husband killed him, and that he had help from a woman who likes to wear charm bracelets and wear cheap perfume? - Yeah. - I'm sorry, this is Rachel. I have to take this really quick. Hey, Rachel. - Hey. We missed you in yoga this morning. Is everything okay? - Yeah, I'm sorry. I just got caught up with work. - No worries. Have you heard the news about Noah? - What news? - He didn't come home last night. Olivia is such a drama queen. I guess she called the cops. They have been banging on doors up and down the block all morning. - Really? - Oh, yeah. I told them, I expect him to come home with a hangover anytime soon. Just like the last few times this happened. - Well, I hope that they find him. Hey, was Giselle in class this morning? - No. Uh, you know, it is so nice of Grant to help her with that lawsuit. She knows better than to ask Derek. - What are you talking about? - Victoria told me that Grant is helping Giselle with her plastic surgery lawsuit. - Well, that's news to me. - Giselle is certainly not keeping it a secret. - Listen, can we talk later? I'm having lunch with my sister. - Sure. Have a nice day. You too. - What happened? - As soon as they get done with the tire impressions... - Sorry to haul you all the way out here. - I rode up with Deputy Fields. If I'd have known, I would have worn different shoes. What do we got? - A jogger over there found the body around 8:00 this morning. Victim's a white male, approximately 40 years old, with multiple stab wounds to the abdomen. From the looks of it, it was a pretty vicious attack. - You think he was killed up here? - No. Found drag marks off the trail, with footprints. The body was definitely dumped. The coroner puts the time of death around midnight. - Don't people move up here to get away from this kind of thing? - Yes? - Olivia Cranor? - Yes. - I'm Detective Sato. This is my partner, Detective Kurland, with the Homicide Division. - What's this about? - We have some news about your husband. May we come inside? - Yes, of course. - What are you doing? I was just about to do some laundry. What are you doing home so early? - I just got a call from Derek. He said Noah was missing. So I came to see if you were okay. - Yeah. I'm okay. But I have a question for you. Why does your shirt from last night reek of Giselle's perfume? - I ran into her at a gas station on the way to town. She gave me a hug hello. You know how much perfume she wears. - Right. How convenient. And somehow you forgot to tell me that you're helping her with that lawsuit. Was she a part of your business trip too? And what is this? - What? Why are you checking up on me? What is this all about? Who is it? - Good afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Malick. I'm Detective Sato. This is my partner, Detective Kurland, with the Homicide Division. We'd like to ask you some questions about your neighbor, Noah Cranor. - Sure, come on in, detectives. Please. - A jogger found Mr. Cranor's body up on the ridge this morning. He had been stabbed to death sometime last night. - That's horrible. - His wife, Olivia Cranor, mentioned that you and Mr. Cranor had a heated argument two nights ago where you threatened to kill him? - Look... yes, Noah and I did have an argument, and unfortunately things were said on both sides. But that's all. I mean, it was forgotten about right afterwards. - Yes, it's also unfortunate that two days later, he's found dead in the nearby mountains. - My husband only went there to confront Noah, because he was stalking me. Did Olivia tell you that? - Did you ever file a police report about this stalking? - I didn't. - And did this stalking take place before or after the circle of trust party? - After. - And how long had you been a part of this group? - It was our first and last time. - Mrs. Malick, did you continue to see Noah Cranor after that one night together? - Look, Noah followed her into a store when she was with one of her clients, if that's what you mean. - And where were you last night, Mr. Malick? - I was in San Diego for work, and I came back early because Lori was ill. - So you were home all night. - Yes. - Look, is there anything else we can do for you gentlemen? We have to get ready for a dinner. - We're probably going to need you both to come down for a more thorough interview tomorrow. - Okay. That's fine. Please just contact our attorney from now on. We'll be turning this matter over to him. - That's a nasty cut you got there. Where did you get that? - His name is Derek Adams. Thank you very much, gentlemen, and best of luck on the investigation. Let us know if we can help you in any other way. - Oh, my God, did you kill him? - Lori-- - No, don't come close to me. - Look, you're being ridiculous. Of course I didn't kill him. Look, you cannot talk to anyone about this without Derek present. The police can use whatever we say against us. - What do you mean "us"? Who are you calling? - Derek. Look, the police obviously think we're suspects. Okay? - Oh, my God. - I don't know what Olivia told them, but I guarantee they're going to come back and search the house for evidence. Derek. Hey, it's Grant. Look, I need your help. Two detectives showed up. No, no, no, they just left... - What are you doing? - You can have the bed tonight. I'll sleep downstairs. - You were with Giselle, weren't you? Grant, we should never have gone to that party. That night destroyed everything that we have ever built together. Search warrant. Police department. Open up. - Grant, wake up. What's going on? - Step aside. - Grant, what is happening? - We've got a search warrant signed by a judge. I think you'll find everything in order, counselor. - Can they do this? - Yes, they can. - I need you both to stay in the living room while I execute this warrant. Thank you for your cooperation. - They're taking my car as evidence. Yeah, Derek, it's Grant. They're here with a search warrant and a team of deputies. Okay. Thanks. What are you doing? - I'm going to stay with Kat for a while. - Honey, I really don't think that's a good idea until we know what's going on. - I know what's going on. - No, you don't. - Grant, stop it. - I don't trust you. And I just don't feel safe in this house anymore. - Honey, I need to borrow your car in the morning to go to work. What am I going to do? - I don't know. Call a cab. Or call Giselle. Excuse me. - Yeah, let's move the deposition to later on next week, and then contact her - and see how she feels-- - Grant Malick. You're under arrest for the murder of Noah Cranor. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. - I know my rights. Call Derek, let him know what's happening, and then call my wife. I am so sorry for all of this. Can you ever forgive me? - Derek told me that they found your footprints at the crime scene. And Noah's blood in your car. What really happened that night? The truth. After we got off the phone, I drove home. And when I got home, I found Noah dead on the rug. And I found you lying on the couch. And next to you on the coffee table, I found a bloody knife. So I dragged Noah's dead body out to the back, put him in my trunk, and drove up to the canyon, and I dumped his body. That's where I got the scratch. I did all of this to protect you, Lori. - I didn't kill him. - I know. - Were you with Giselle that night? - On my way down to San Diego, I stopped by her house in the desert. I lied to you. I cheated on you. And betrayed you. I'm so sorry, Lori. I have no excuse. - So then who killed Noah? And who drugged me? - Giselle told me that her and Noah had an affair last year. She also told me that she borrowed some money from him. And when she told him she couldn't pay him back, he started to harass her and stalk her. Does that sound familiar? - You think that Giselle has something to do with this? - I don't know. Maybe. Giselle. Derek already called me. I can't help you. I'm sorry. - Look, I just want to know where you were on the night of Noah's murder. You think I was involved? - Do you have an alibi? - I was with my husband. - Well, does he know you were having an affair with mine? Or Noah? Maybe you had a reason to kill him. I heard he was stalking you, just like me. - Really? Did you also hear about Olivia going to Rachel last week asking for comps on her house? Saying she was thinking about putting it on the market? Did you see the "for sale" sign outside her front lawn this morning? She's not exactly acting like the grieving widow. Why don't you ask her where she was the night of the murder. If anyone had a reason to kill that son of a bitch, it was her. - Lori. - Olivia. How are you doing? - I'm okay. What do you want? - Can we talk? You have some nerve coming over here after your husband killed my Noah. For all I know, you helped him. Go home. - Look, you're wrong, okay? I know my husband, and Grant is not capable of killing anybody. - Please take your hand off my door and go. - Look, I have proof that somebody else did it. Can I please come in and talk to you about it? Please? - Fine. Okay, I'm listening. - I know that Giselle was having an affair with Noah. - You've been talking to Rachel. The gossip queen. - Listen, I think that Giselle killed Noah, because he was harassing her about money that she owed him. - That's your proof? Neighborhood gossip? - Come on. You had to know about the affair. - My private life is my business. Giselle was having an affair with my husband too. And she told him a few important things, like how she was trying to get Noah into a trap, so she could kill him. I guess the threats and the harassment was getting to be too much for her. - Then why did the police have enough evidence to arrest your husband? - Because Giselle set him up. - Excuse me. I have to take this. Hey. Yeah, not until the life insurance policy pays out. Yeah, I know. Let me call you back. I have to take care of something. Puerto Vallarta. What? - I am so sorry for your loss. - Made some coffee. - Thank you, but you really didn't have to do that. - No trouble. I insist. - Okay. I think that might be my sister. - Lori, where are you? - It is. I am so sorry. Listen, can we talk later? - I'm going to be pretty busy from now on. - Okay. Excuse me. - I sat in traffic for an hour to get here just so I can make a phone call? - And to keep lookout. I need to get over there, get in the house, and see if I can find that bracelet, or anything else that's going to prove that she did it. Just make the call. This really doesn't sound like a good idea. - Well, what else am I supposed to do? Call the police? And tell them what? That I saw a suspicious-looking bracelet in a picture? Okay. I hope this works. - It'll work. Here's the number. Try to sound scary. - It's okay. You can do this. - Hello? - Don't talk, just listen. I know you killed your husband, Noah. - Uh, I have no idea what you're talking about. - I was out for a walk that night, and I saw you leave Lori's house. - Who is this? - We can talk about that later. Meet me at the Coffee Kiosk, 20 minutes. - Why would I do that? - Because you don't want me talking to the police, do you? - Kat, that was perfect. - I don't think she's going to fall for it. - I told you. Look. She's leaving. I knew it. Does that look like an innocent woman to you? - No. - Exactly. Kay, I want you to call me the second that you see any sign of her coming back. - Right. Okay, good luck. And be careful. ♪ ♪ - Come on, Lori. ♪ ♪ My sister's watching. - Not anymore. - Lori! Lori! Lori! Lori? Hello? Lori? Oh. Detective Sato? Please, it's an emergency. - We're at Giselle's desert house. I followed Noah out here when he'd sneak off to be with her. Nobody's going to find us. It's a shame what happened with Kat. She ran out of lives. Yours is a tragic little story too. You found out that Grant was cheating on you with Giselle, and in a jealous rage, you came out here to confront her. But there was a struggle, and she killed you. That's not how I originally planned it. You were supposed to be arrested for Noah's murder, but your husband came home and ruined everything. It all worked out anyway. He's in jail. You're dead. Giselle will be arrested for killing you, and I will be long gone. ♪ ♪ - Lori. - Kat? - This is Detective Sato. Where are you? - Lori? Come out. - I'm at Giselle's house, somewhere in the desert. - There's nowhere to hide. - Olivia's going to kill me. - Whatever you do... - Lori? - ...keep your line open. We're on our way. Call Giselle Monahan. Get that address. - I see you, Lori. - You're not making it out of here alive. - Why are you doing this? Why did you kill Noah? - He forced me to go to those parties. Continued to have affairs with some of those women. I suffered for years with that humiliation. And I knew you'd be his next conquest. So the night your husband left, I followed him to your house. I saw him break in. Hide around the corner when you came downstairs. After Noah drugged you, he waited... till you passed out. And then he made his move. But so did I. ♪ ♪ - And I made sure that your fingerprints were all over the knife. - You're a murderer. You're going to go to jail. - Don't judge me. You have no idea what Noah was really like. His verbal and physical abuse. It's been going on for years. He's been horrible to me. He treated me like I was his property. After I found out about the divorce and that he was going to leave me with nothing, I had to survive. You would have done the same thing. - No. I'm not like you. ♪ ♪ - I wanted to do this in person instead of having my lawyer send it over. - That means everything to me. - It's official. You are divorced. This just feels like a bad dream, and I can't wake up from it. I'm really sorry for the way everything turned out. - Yeah, me too. We just need time to heal. Move on with our lives. - Thanks for giving me the listing. - I know you'll take really good care of it. - Come on, you know how I hate traffic. - One sec. It's my little sister. We're going to live together again. Kind of like back in college. - Hey, don't be a stranger. You're always part of this neighborhood. - Well, don't hate me if I never make it back.
