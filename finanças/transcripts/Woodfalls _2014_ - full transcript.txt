Because you just don't know how to handle responsibility. What? We broke up because of me? Yes. Because of you. Nah. Nah. We broke up because you went to [INAUDIBLE] and you didn't want a boyfriend while yous was there. Don't walk away from me, you gypsy scum. That's the very reason why I can't trust you. You don't know how handle responsibility. I'm frickin' sick of it. Oh my gosh, what ...? God, Bradley, this is actually serious. Are you going to do something? Just let it end!

It's you. Hey, were you expecting anyone? There was some van parked up in the yard. Didn't recognize it. Nearly fucking knocked me over when it drove off. So what? You seen Wozzle lately? No, why? Hasn't been around recently. Got a few ounces I need him to shift. Is it grade? What did you say that van looked like? Blue VW. Pretty good lick. Who was driving? Didn't get a very good look. Russ? Russ? There you are. So that's where you've been hiding. Damon. Didn't know you were there; I'd have put my makeup on. You want some breakfast, hun? The pan's hot. How about you, Damon? Make you a nice bacon Sammie? No, I'm all right. What happened to you? Russ, have you seen his eye? Mm. Have you been fighting? Is it sore? It's fine. It looks bad. What horrible bastard did that to you, eh? It's nothing, dad. He shouldn't get away with it. Can you believe this, Russ? Need some help looking after yourself, do ya? Nah. Don't be mean to him. Shut your face. I want you to find Wozzle. And tell him we need to get rid of this. All right. I think he's having a party tonight. Good. Do you want me to take the bag over to him? Are you a fucking idiot? Just get him here. Hey! Hey! Ginger cunt. Get up. Get up! I need to talk to you. Come on, you fucking loser. Are you having trouble moving your weed? Nah, mate. Why? You haven't been around for ages. Dad's got another ounce for ya. I've been getting some of this fucking grade shit. You are? What? Don't mean no offense, but your dad ain't got better than me. What the fuck are you talking about? Look, mate. I don't know what you've heard, but these new blokes are a fucking bunch of rough cunts. Listen, dickhead. I don’t know what you fucking heard. When and if there is shit going down, my dad will be on top of it. You know that. Look, Damon, what's done is done, yeah? And anyway, this fucking new grade shit is sweet mate. Have a taste. Honest. Don't fucking smile at me, you ugly little bastard. Get out of my fucking face. What do you want me to say? Don't look at me like that. You have got no right. Do you know who he is? Yeah. This is Billy. Billy Mar. Do you know where he lives? Yeah, I do. Problem? Problem? Yeah. I have got a problem with it, haven't you? No, I haven't actually. You haven't? You fancy that gypo-pig, do ya? Oh, what's the matter, Damon? Don't like getting beaten up? I heard it was three against one as well. Bit embarrassing. Look at me, not him. I ain't interested in you, love. Been there. Done that. Really? I'd forgotten. If you've got a problem, fella ... Billy, pipe down, love. Yeah. Pipe down, Billy. What did you want to talk about then, eh? Everything all right, babes? You sound dull. And how's your dad? I heard he's had some problems. I hope he's not scared. I heard he should be. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Hey! What the fuck are you getting involved for? Fuck off. Get out. Get back the fuck. Oh, have her now. Have your faggy little boyfriend. Big man. Fucking slut. Fuck yourself! Fucking disgraceful. Get out of the fucking way, stupid. Oh, fuck off! Come on, we're going. Come on, let's fucking go. Now, now. Get up. Fucking retard. Yeah, what? [Coughing]. What time is it? It's pretty early, mate. Ugh. What are you two doing sneaking around? Nothing-nothing. Just didn't want to wake you. Did you try fucking me in my sleep? Nah, mate. Wouldn't blame you. I'm gorgeous. [Coughing]. Fucking hell. Ugh. You're looking nervous about something. No, I'm just pretty hung over, mate. Last night was ... Listen. Last night, man ... it was a little bit intense. It's the thing with that fucking gypo-kid. It's gone a bit far. Yeah, right, mate. I mean ... Yeah right, mate, I mean what, Sammie?? Stop stuttering like a little spastic and say what you want to say to me. He's just fucking nervous. I wasn't talking to you. Oh, fuck off. What did you fucking say? Nothing. What is this then? Eh? Two best mates sneaking out of my flat in the morning, banging on me? It's just last night got a little out of hand. Oh, so he does fucking speak? Shame it's only bullshit what comes out his mouth. I'll tell you what, Sammie. When you grow a pair of balls come back to me. We'll have a chat, yeah? Come on, let's just fucking go. Yeah, let's just fucking go. Fuck off, you fucking pussy. Get out! Who fucking needs you, you wet pair of cunts? Damon, mate ... What are you staring at? You fancy me? You want a kiss? Get out, you fucking knob head. Go on if you're fucking going. Get out of my fucking flat. Pair of faggies. You're a pair of fucking faggots! Not bad. I'm making a move tomorrow. Where? Doesn't matter. If anyone asks, tell them nothing. All right. How will I reach ya? You won't. It's for the best. This whole situation's soured. What? With them guys in the van? Why don't you stick around and sort it out? You've got mates to even up the numbers. Who? Piff, Trev, Reg. Me. We can sort it out. It's over. Why don't you trust me? Why don't you give me a chance?! Fucking hell! [POUNDING ON DOOR]. Damon! Damon?! Open the door! Where's he gone? He hasn't been home for days. I don’t know. Tell me. Is it another woman? Is it another woman? Found some other tail, has he? Younger? Better looking? Tell me! What did I do? Are you hear for the service? Just like my brother. He doesn't like much church much either. What are you playing at? Excuse me? Staring at me. I am not. It's just your eyes. What about them? Nothing. They're just bright and ... in a good way. I was just looking for my great Aunt Tina's gravestone. My dad said she was buried around here, but I think he was lying about it. Why would he lie about that? That's what I said. Stupid man. My ma says she can see my dad while she's in church. Like he's still here or something. Do you believe in all that? I honestly don't know what to believe. But if it makes her happy then ... You don't say much. No. I've ran out of things to say. How's that? You've not said anything. All right. Get off my case, will ya? Anyway. I reckon you do enough chatting for the both of us. If I'm rambling, you can tell me to shut up. I'm used to it. Nah, you're all right. I'm Damon. Rebecca. Pleased to meet you, Rebecca. I've got to go. Is that your boyfriend? No. My brother. Obviously. Do you know him? We've met. [KNOCKING ON DOOR]. Open up! Open up! Where is she? Open the fucking door! Who is it? Doesn't matter, just open the fucking door. Where is she? Where is my sister? Who? My sister, you bastard. Open the door! Mate, I don't know what you're talking about, I don't ... Just open the fucking door! You fucking bastard! Whoa, mate! You're breathing's not sounding too good, ma. I'm all right. Must be some damp in the air or something. You look tired too. You're not looking so good yourself, my boy. Ma, I'm getting a bit worried about money. Why? I ain't worked since the move. I told you. Your da put some pennies aside for this. We're all right. If I could get hold of some scrap, maybe some gates. I told you don't worry. We're comfortable. Comfortable? I wouldn't call this comfortable. I'm sick of crapping in a bucket. Where did our home go?. [GUN SHOT]. You didn't catch anything? There's nothing around here. There are rabbits everywhere, Billy. Takes a miracle to avoid them. You're just a bad shot. Look, I'm tellin' ya. Why don't you take me out with ya? You know I can shoot. What do you know about shooting a gun? Looks like more than you. Who's that? Who is that? I don’t know. Is it a colored man? It's black. You can't go around calling them "colors" no more. What? Are you lost, pal? No. Well, whatcha' want then? I don't remember inviting you around here. I'm Bradley. Well, good for you, mate. I'm Rebecca. This is ... Rebecca, go in the caravan. Now! Becca? I don't appreciate you turning up like this. One of them clowns from last night sent ya. Nah, nah ... Just get lost. You need to calm down, bro. This ain't got shit to do with me. 'Broth. Just see this here. It's my fucking home. You don't bring a pub fight to my home. I'm not here to fight you. Oh, yeah? I see how it is. Yeah, that so? Laugh at the stinking gypsy-boy, yeah? You know what? If I am the gypsy-boy, you's the nigger. The what? The nigger? I came here to show you respect. Respect, boy! I didn't mean anything by it. You don't think I have put up with the same shit as well? Gypsies, niggers ... what' s the fucking difference, eh? Does your friend want sugar in his tea? Thanks. We have Victoria sponge inside. If you want some. Becca, go inside. [INAUDIBLE] you should go dust the china or something. Jeeze. So where did you spring up from? Oh, we're from all over. Ireland, Eastbourne, Hem Hempstead. Scary shit on the news a while back. With the riots. And the evictions. Did you get evicted? [INAUDIBLE] half to death I did. Police barging in with their riot gear and tear gas. We're looking for peace here. What part from Leeds there, boyo. [Chuckles]. The accent's still strong then? My ma's cousin's from Leeds. You never lose the accent. Yeah. Listen, my ma's gonna be back anytime soon. And she'll go here if she sees a gorger. Gorger? People who live in houses. You people got names for us like Pikey and Gypsy and what-not. We've got names for you too. So I wasn't sure if it'd be your thing. But there's a party tonight if you want to come. Tonight? Yeah. Just a house party. The guy's a bit of a cunt, to be honest. But it should be a laugh. I don't know about tonight. Come on, I think you need to meet new people though. After yesterday, people want to meet you. You're like ... you're like a little celebrity. Celebrity? Seriously. The Gypsy Fighter. Get up! I need to wee. Piss off. Feel like [INAUDIBLE], mate. No point lazing about it now, is there? My god. Look at the state of you. You've never done this before? Don't worry about it, you're just wired. You hungry yet? No. You will be. Here. Who's is that? Who gives a shit? You need to sort yourself out. I'm not using that. Billy. Brush your teeth. [Crying]. You should have been here! Don't be ashamed of ya. No! No. Should I call the police? Oh, don't be a [INAUDIBLE]. When have the police ever been kind to us? I suppose you want me to give the boys a ring, do ya? Get Uncle Marvin to come down. That'll do us a whole lot of good. No, you're probably right. More trouble is the last thing we need. We can't go on like this though. They scared your poor sister half to death. She keeps going on about some pig-man. Pig-man? Hello, Bradley? Yeah, it's me, Billy. What's going on, fella? Now listen. I need to ask you a favor. What do you want to do? I don’t know. My ma's lying in bed. Can't hardly breathe. This fucking shit sprayed up against the side of my trailer. Fucking cunt. Listen. Damon deserves everything that's coming his way. Sounds like I'm hiding. Which you already gave him. Look what we got in return. Come around terrorizing my whole family. Listen. If you're going there now, yeah, you'll end up killing him. Do you want more trouble? I never wanted any trouble. Trouble finds me. And you can end it before it gets any worse. I admit, what Damon did went way too far. But folks won't stand for that. And no one wants him or his shitty dad around here anyway. They're finished around here. Trust me. Folks will have your back from now on. I can't just do nothing. No, no. You see ... you see now, you misunderstood me. I never said we was going to do nothing. I just think there's a better way to handle this.. Hey. How are you? All right, Billy. How are you doing? I'm all right. I brought these for you. You brought ...? You brought me flowers? Yeah. Do you like them? They're all right. Why did you buy me flowers? Because of the other night. Because now I ... you know ... because what happened the other night. Right. Just take them. Look, Billy. You're a really nice guy and everything, but ... But what? What do you want? Mommy's coming, Leo. Look, it was fun the other night. But [sighs] I've got a lot on my plate, yeah? So just leave it at that? I'll see you around. He's only about 20 minutes late. Don't. Don't stick up for him. He always does it. Always fucking late. Hey, Bradley? Yeah? Did you know Kelly had a kid? Of course, mate. Who's the father? Wouldn't you like to know? There's a few possible suspects. She gets around a bit? Oh, you could say that. About fucking time. Give me some love, brother. How you been? Good. I'm doing good. Sorry I'm late, buddy. Had to see a man about a thousand [INAUDIBLE], you know what I mean? It's okay. I was just chillin'. I can say that, mate. I can say that. I'll tell you what, buddy, I've got a fucking treat for you here. Give that a fucking sniff, mate. Nice. It's all right here. Nice. Mm. I'll tell you what; I've got [INAUDIBLE]. I get it straight off the ferry from Amsterdam. Some of the best shit in Holland, I tell you. Yo, did Russel [INAUDIBLE]? Russel? Oh, mate, ain't no way. You'd have to be two bullets short of a nubbin to deal with him now. Between you and me, mate, Russel's finished. Yeah, I've heard about that. Well, it's common knowledge, isn't it? But, you know, we'll see what happens. [Laughs]. Fucking hell, Bradley, is that who I think it is? What? Billy? King of the fucking gypsies. How you doing, man? You're all right. Fucking hell, I heard about you the other day. You made a right fucking mess of them lads, didn't ya? Walked into Brucey the other day, right? Wolfing down his fucking Olympic breakfast, right? I says to him, I went, "Ay! Brucey! What the fuck happened to your nose, mate?" You know what he says? He goes, "Some fucking gypo smashed my face in." Fucking dickhead. We all saw ... you know? You're known for that, aren't ya? I'm watching that on YouTube, that bare-knuckle fighting, the other night. Fucking hell, that's vicious, man. You ever done any of that? No. Fucking hell, mate. Cheer up. Might never happen. Boop! Got your nose. Here, have it back. You should do that though, Bradders. Look at those fucking arms. I bet there's a fortune in it for ya. Should call you're Bradley-fucking-Schwarzenegger, shouldn't they? You still, you know, working out at a gym and that? Nah, I'm [INAUDIBLE] those boxers. Still working at MSA? Yeah. Ox Theater now. Fucking hell, mate. Cushiony job, that. Fucking Cushiony. You working while you're down here, bud? Bet you've got a little bit on the side though, don't ya, you know what I mean? What do you mean? [Chuckling] You know what I mean. You got something to say, sweet fella? Wozzle. Hey, we've got a few things we need to do, you know? Couple people we need to meet. Now then, you got a little something for me? Oh, yeah. Shit. Shit. Cheers, Brad. Now then, you boys have a good time, yeah? Smoke that shit right up. Fucking hell. That shit will make your brain melt, your ears fall off, and turn your nipples hard as fuck, mate, I tell ya. See you boys later. Have a good one, yeah? Sleeping in the car like a tramp? Whatever next? I didn't want to wake Rebecca. Oh, you do remember you have a family, do ya? What's that supposed to mean? It means you're the man of the family. And you ain't acting like it. You're never in. Always with the gorgie boys. And coming in late. Stinking of smoke and God knows what else. I don't smoke. Oh, let me see those fingers. Give me those fingers! Give me your fingers! Stink of smoke, they do. Stink! And your poor sister. She's lonelier than I've ever seen her. Hasn't got a friend in the world. Maybe we're getting to the end of our stay around here. Nobody's happy around here. I am. Look, I was thinking, ma. Maybe I could get a job of my own. Get some money. Make us a bit more comfortable. Oh, Billy. This ain't our land. These ain't our people. You really want to stay with the gorges? What about your aunts and uncles and cousins? What about finding a nice girl and getting some nippers of your own? That's life. Not this. Listen, Bradley. My mom wants to move away. She hasn't been happy since she got here. I was kind of expecting it. We don't really stick around for too long anyway. When do you think? A day or two. Maybe a week. Doesn't take long to pack up and leave.

She says people change in the night and it's best to stay away. I've never understood her fear, but I've never really understood the Bible either. The Word is sometimes too big to read and I don't think it makes much sense. My mom loves it though. It's her favorite. The smoke won't be doing too much good for your breathing, ma. I didn't think of that. Bugger to both of ya, my breathing's fine. Do you have any bread to toast? No, we need it for breakfast in the morning. Oh, but mom ... You'll be the first one to mourn if you can't have any toast in the morning. We won't be here for long anyway. Been in touch with your Uncle Marvin. He's settled up in Gloster. Said he's found a nice site. Are you sure you want to [INAUDIBLE] with Uncle Marvin though? That man can be trouble. He's your family. Besides, there's no work for you around here. And Rebecca's lonely. Where is she going to find a nice man to court? Probably nowhere. Not all of us got the Italian blood did we, Billy? Oh, I know. Guess I wasn't so lucky. You've got a little bit of Italian in ya. I think it's just a paler shade. What's all this Italian? Are you joking, ma? Are you serious, ma? What? There's no Italian in this family. What about dad? Your father had olive skin. There was no Italian. Don't yous look at me like that. Your dad was born in Shropshire, England. Yeah, but he had Italian blood, ma. Oh! How dare you? He was a full-blooded Englishman. Proud of it too. Italian. Oh, God. Whatever next? What does it say, Becca? Gypsy cunts. What's a cunt, Billy? Stupid gorger language. Bad language? Hey, Becca? About last night ... Sorry I wasn't here and that. Just to let you know, it's all been sorted. We're going to be all right. For real? For real. Get scrubbin'. Mom, do you mind if I go and have a look for great Aunt Tina's gravestone? I told you, Rebecca. Your dad might have made that up. Made up all sorts of silly lies in his time. But he stayed around here, didn't he? And she got sick, so why would he lie about it? All right. But don't you leave these grounds. And don't be too long. You don't want to miss the service. But if you do warn the wicked person to turn from their ways, and they do not do so, they will die for their sin. Though you, yourself will be saved. Now, my girl. Doesn't that fill you with hope?

No. Well then, I don't think you're one either. So you've got nothing to worry about. Rebecca, my girl! Would you give us a hand folding these sheets? Did Billy say if he was going to be in for his tea tonight? He didn't say. Oh, of course he didn't. Lovely girl. You look as pretty as a picture. Really? Ah, lovely. You're going to make a man very happy someday. Maybe sooner off than later? Oh, you in some sort of a hurry? No. No, I'm ... not really, but I'm not getting any younger, am I?
