(waves lapping) (ominous music) - [Voiceover] 7 PM, Eastern war time, Bob Chauff reporting. The Japanese have accepted our terms fully, that's the word we've just received from the White House in Washington. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the end of the Second World War. (cheering) - [Voiceover] Ladies and gentlemen, The President of the United States. - [Truman] A short time ago, an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima. That bomb has more power than 20,000 tons of TNT. It is an atomic bomb. It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe. (ominous music) (cheering) Having found the atomic bomb, we have used it. It is an awful responsibility, which has come to us. We thank God that it has come to us instead of to our enemy. And we pray that he may guide us to use it in his ways, and for his purposes. (ominous music) - [Director] Action. - The atom bomb is here. It exists. We must look to the future. Up until now, only three have been exploded and none over the water. It is a duty of the military services to explore the military might of this new weapon. We want to be prepared for any use of atomic energy that may become necessary whether offensive or defensive. - [Voiceover] Out of Washington comes the story of Operation Crossroads. The Special Committee on Atomic Energy checks final plans for the forthcoming atom bomb tests at sea in which 100 warships will be used. Vice-Admiral Blandy tells the committee, - The site of the test will be Bikini Atoll in the Marshalls Group. Bikini is situated in the Marshall Islands between 160 and 170 degrees east longitude. The lagoon is 27 miles long, that is from east to west and a little more than half of that north to south. (airplane engine humming) (speaking Marshallese) - Now then, James, tell them please that the United States government now wants to turn this great destructive power into something for the benefit of all mankind. And that these experiments, here at Bikini, are the first step in that direction. (speaking Marshallese) - [Director] Crossroads, scene 25, take 1. - Well now then, James, will you tell them that the United States government now wants to turn this great, destructive force into something good for mankind. Something good for mankind. Something good for mankind. All right, is that all? - [Director] Okay, cut it. (cheerful island music) (foreign language lyrics) (speaking Marshallese) (cheerful island music) (foreign language lyrics) - [Voiceover] By means of electrical transcription, we bring you the first in the series of programs previewing the atom bomb experiments in the Marshall Islands. One of the most important, and one of the most dramatic elements concerned with the dropping of the bomb is the photographic aspect. How many cameras are going to used on this operation here? - [Voiceover] There will be 104 still cameras, and 208 motion picture cameras. - [Voiceover] Some of our statisticians have computed that we're going to make as many pictures in the first several seconds as are made in 11 Hollywood productions. - [Voiceover] That's a lot of footage. What would it run to in weight? - [Voiceover] We brought over 18 tons, so we'd have enough. - We really and truly didn't know what was coming out because were told we were going on a test. And the test there would be nothing to be concerned with. Don't bother about anything, there's no restrictions on us, so do as you're told and there won't be any harm coming to anybody. (tranquil island music) - [Voiceover] Go ahead, Operation Crossroads at Bikini. We are speaking to you from the island of Bikini. We think this is a rather auspicious occasion, because of the fact that this is probably the first time and no doubt the last that a radio station will be broadcasting from Bikini. This island has been read about and told about, and you've seen pictures of it in the papers, in magazines, and over the radio for the past several months. Now, this is an actual broadcast from this location. - When we arrived there, we found out that the weather was a little on the warm side, running about 100 degrees with about 100 percent humidity. So it was pretty warm and humid. So the less clothing we could wear, the better off we were. At least we thought we were at the time. We started to try to get into the water to swim a little bit, and we did that with no problems. So it was swimming and eating a lot of ice cream. Just anything to keep our minds occupied at the time. (laughing) - Well I know it's certainly grand to see some femininity out here. Because, as you said, 42,000 men and 22 women, the competition's quite great, and one dog I see standing right here. ♫ Inside a blue lagoon I kissed you ♫ It was in September ♫ - [John] They cut up, actful, as boys would. (whistling) Everybody was on a sort of a good attitude. I thought we were. I was. We thought it was wonderful the way they were treating us there. And had all the ice cream we could eat. We had some of this, what-you-call-it, Sweetu Beer. Trying to cool off with that. - Well, tell me, Fitzgerald, how do you feel about being here? Do you like the assignment? - Yes, sir. Not bad at all. - Are you married? - No, sir. - Are you going to have any grandchildren to tell about this? - I don't know, sir. - Well, let's hope you do. How old are you? - 18, sir. - 18. How long have you been in the service now? - About four months. - About four months. Well boy, you're starting out on a real one. Thank you very much. - [Voiceover] For months from Washington to the Central Pacific, plans have moved ahead on one of the most gigantic experiments the world has ever known. A joint operation this July to determine whether present sea power is obsolete. In secret files, an exhaustive schedule of planning and consultation is perfected as public interest in the vast operation mounts. An answer to repeated criticisms of what may be the greatest mass destruction in naval history, Vice-Admiral W.H. Blandy says, - It has been said that any reasonably industrialized nation can produce the atom bomb in a few years. I know that you would not want your homes protected by a military machine obsolete and inadequate to meet the dangers of any form of attack. - Crossroads, U.S.S. Panamint, Mexican UN Observer singing a church service. (singing in foreign language) - Congressman Engel, what interests you most about this test? - I am interested in the effect of the blast upon the animals. Because by studying such effects, we will learn, approximately, what may happen to humans in the event they're exposed to atomic attack. (operatic choral music) - We were told to do as you're ordered and nothing will become of it, and nothing will happen to you. And that's exactly what we did. Being a country boy, like the majority of us were, we didn't know of any type of a bomb. We really didn't know it was a type of a bomb that they exploded over there. - "We scientists, who released this immense power "have overwhelming responsibility to bring realization "to America that mankind's destiny is being decided today, "now, this moment. "We ask your help in this fateful moment, as signed, "that we scientists do not stand alone." - I agree. (dark music) - [Voiceover] For a late report on the atom bomb test at Bikini, stay tuned to your mutual station. We take you now to New York. - [Voiceover] This Security Council chamber is packed as its never been before to listen to this historic declaration as the government of the United States is about to present its plan for the world control of atomic energy. And now, we give you Mr. Bernard Baruch, the American delegate to the United Nations' Commission on Atomic Energy. - My fellow members of the United Nations, Atomic Energy Commission, and my fellow citizens of the world. We are here to make a choice between the quick and the dead. That is our business. Behind the black portend of the new atomic age lies a hope which, seized upon with faith, can work our salvation. If we fail, then we have damned every man to be the slave of fear. Now, if ever, is the time to act for the common good. We of this nation, realizing the heavy obligations upon us are rising from our possession of the means of producing the bomb, and from the fact that it is a part of our armament, are prepared to make a full contribution toward effective control of atomic energy. (speaking Russian) (applause) - Mr. Molotov's speech indicated distrust and misunderstanding of the motives of the United States and of other members of the United Nations. Our motives, in war and peace, we leave to the judgement of history. - [Voiceover] Now, from the ship carrying scientific observers and UN representatives, here is ABC correspondent, Clete Roberts. Go ahead, Bikini. - [Voiceover] This is Clete Roberts, reporting from Bikini Lagoon. A little over an hour ago, Vice-Admiral Blandy announced that the A-bomb will subsequently be dropped tomorrow. Crews will begin leaving the target ship. - [John We were in the lagoon on the morning of July 1st. We were told then that we were moving out, and we would go out to the mothership, which we called Mount McKinley which was about nine miles out. And that was early in the morning, we started out in the lagoon. We were the last ship out of the lagoon, the last personnel out of the lagoon. So we wasn't afraid of anything, because we knew at time-- or felt at the time why we were well-protected, we had nothing to be afraid of. (speaking Marshallese) - [Voiceover] Major Brilly of the Netherlands. - Good morning. - Colonel Raghav of Egypt. Military attache in Washington. Colonel Osman of Egypt. How do you do? Dr. Correa of Mexico. Colonel Gonzalez of Mexico. Vice Air Marshal Steadman, how do you do? Major General Lipton, Canada. Dr. Aleksondrov of Russia. Dr. Migilikov of Russia. General Hu of China, military attache in Washington also. Commander Sturgeon of Australia. Dr. Vincrosky of Poland. Dr. Sevra of Poland, how do you do? Nice to see you, doctor. Dr. Goldsmith of France, how do you do? Mr. Presley, England. How do you do? A member of Parliament. I know that you'd be interested, as I will be to see these tests tomorrow. And I know that you are aware that they are conducted in not any frivolous or casual fashion. That they do not constitute any gesture of war, or aggression, or threat. Thank you very much. (applause) - [Voiceover] Hello ABC, this is Lee Vanatter reporting from Air Force Atomic Headquarters in Kwajalein. There's only a few hundred yards from where I am speaking to a certain atomic bomb, the Bikini bomb. It is a novel and yet somehow satisfying sensation to know that bomb is both nearing here. That sensation of something more powerful than anything man has known before being present on this incongruously tiny coral atoll in the middle of the Pacific. - Experiment provides experience. Experience fortifies theory. Knowledge is power. The way is clear, the challenge strong. The duty inescapable. We must have the facts. Common sense calls for the facts, now. - [Voiceover] Anxiously waiting for this is Mrs. Carolyn Swancutt, mother of Major Woodrow Swancutt, pilot of Dave's Dream, the B-29 which will drop the Bikini bomb. Mrs. Swancutt, do you feel a little anxious along with him? - [Mrs. Swancutt] I certainly do, but I have much faith and confidence in Woody. I know that he will do the very best that he can. - [Voiceover] Of course he will. - [Mrs. Swancutt] And may the grace of God be with him and his crew. - [Voiceover] Mrs. Swancutt is browsing through-- - [Mrs. Swancutt] "Don't worry about me, mother. "Believe me when I say we're in no danger at all "in the test no matter what you have heard, "and have confidence in me, I'll be okay." - [Voiceover] Ladies and gentlemen, today is Able Day, the day that the fourth atomic bomb ever dropped in history is scheduled to explode over a ghost fleet in Bikini Lagoon. In just a few moments, the superfortress carrying that bomb will take off from Kwajalein to begin a four-hour flight to H-hour. For an eyewitness report of this historic event, we take you now to Kwajalein. - [Voiceover] This is W.W. Chapman on a hangar roof overlooking the atom bomb plane runway on Kwajalein Island. The time has come to send the atom bomb by air to Bikini. To burst in cosmic fury over an anchored skinny fleet of American, Japanese, and German Naval vessels. The most explosive experiment in history is about to begin. Now the plane is swinging around. Now, I think he's ready to go. He's giving her the gun. The atom bomb plane, Dave's Dream, is starting down the runway. 50 miles an hour, now 60, he's on his way. Over 80 miles now. Now we're up to 100. 120, and he's just about there. He starts up in the air, he's up! The plane is airborne, the atom bomb is in the air on its way to Bikini for the greatest experiment, the most explosive experiment in history. (plane engine humming) (radio chatter and static) - [Voiceover] At this time NBC interrupts its regular program schedule to bring you a history making broadcast. The actual dropping of the bomb at Bikini. In a matter of minutes now, an army superfortress will drop that bomb on target ships in Bikini lagoon. There are those who predict it may be the last such test if nations now can agree to outlaw the bomb. The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission now is analyzing that problem, and the world waits to see whether there can be a compromise between our own plan for controlling atomic energy and that of Soviet Russia. Aboard 22 target ships in the lagoon are the animals which are soon to draw their last breaths for humanity. The result of what happens to war making equipment will undoubtedly determine the course of military might for generations to come. - [PA System] It is now 30 seconds to zero time. Put on goggles or turn away. Do not remove goggles or face first until 10 seconds after the first light. - [Voiceover] We're holding our goggles adjusted now, because we expect to hear the signal from the bombardier at any moment. - Crossroads, scene 1, take 1, A-day first. USS Panamint. - [Voiceover] It's no longer moments, it's a matter of seconds now. Seconds ticking against the backdrop of the sun. The bomb is away and falling! - [John] At that time, they started the countdown. And we wasn't really sure, because they said it would be a big bomb. And it would show off a lot of heat, and we would feel a shockwave. Be prepared for that. And they told us that be sure to cover our eyes when they count down to zero. - [Voiceover] 12, 11, 10, 9, - [Voiceover] All green. - [Voiceover] 8, 7, 6, 5, four, three, two, one, zero. (explosion) - [John] I thought it was great, I thought it was one of the greatest things I've ever seen. And it was, really. Being from the country, of course, I would've never had a chance to see anything like that in my lifetime. Sitting back there, seeing this huge fire rolling up into the skies. It was something that was unbelievable. And anything that everybody was saying was, "Ah, look a there." - [Reporter] Congressman Ezak, what was your first general impression of the explosion of the atomic bomb a few moments ago? - It was one of keen disappointment, I'll say. It looked to me as if the Navy Department was afraid members of congress would get too close, and that they do not consider us expendable. - It struck me as the most awe-inspiring, and magnificent man-made spectacle I have ever seen in my life. - It put me pretty much in mind of the setting sun. - It seemed like a huge, giant firecracker. - [Reporter] To go from Bikini Atoll back to Brooklyn, what do you think they were doing in Brooklyn at the time the atom bomb exploded? - Well, if the Dodgers were playing today, I'm pretty sure they were out to see the bums. (cheering) - [Voiceover] The National Broadcasting Company interrupts all its programs to bring you a special broadcast. - [Voiceover] A few hours ago the atomic bomb was dropped on the target in Bikini. Aboard this vessel which carries the scientific observers and United Nations representatives there is, without a doubt, a keen sense of disappointment. Disappointment with what we witnessed this morning. It was a successful experiment for the army and navy, but from 20 miles away, it was a pretty poor spectacle. - Until I have seen the destruction measured by the various instruments and seen the destruction itself, I would reserve judgement as to whether or not I'm ready to abolish the army and navy, and go to throwing atomic baseballs. (somber orchestral music) - [John] And we got our orders to go to ground zero. And when we went to ground zero, steaming in past the target ships, we saw various sights that went on, because some of the target were burned real bad. Some of them had holes in them. The ships were turned in every direction, the ones that were left. All the paint was removed from them, the gun barrels were twisted, the structures were twisted. And by standing on the top side, we went within yards or so of all the target ships that was in the lagoon. - [Voiceover] Many of the officers aboard the flagship here are very optimistic now that the first Able operation has gone off successfully and almost exactly on time. They're very optimistic about the Baker test. As a matter of fact, I've heard a number of the men say that they believe Baker will go off on or about July 22nd, which gives just exactly three weeks. That was Admiral Blandy's original statement that if everything went off satisfactorily, then within three weeks, Baker should come about. - [John] During this whole time from July 1st through the 24th, there really wasn't too much restrictions again. By it being so hot, we slept on the top deck. Slept any place we could find. Maybe it would cool off early in the morning sometimes we would catch a few winks at that time if we weren't on duty. This is how we spent our whole time aboard ship those 24 days there until the second test that we had. I don't recall, during that whole time that I was there, that any words along radioactivity had been spoken of to us, the crew members I'm talking about. They have used the word radioactive up in the higher class, up in the officers. So I wasn't an officer, I was an enlisted man, so we were never told about any radioactive exposure or anything that way. In fact, we didn't really know what the word was. - [Voiceover] How do you do, ladies and gentlemen, this is Arthur Frenger reporting. Reporting to you from the tiny isle of Rongerik, deep in the Central Pacific Ocean, some halfway between the Orient and the mainland of the United States. Here we are, on the tiny isle where the natives of Bikini have been evacuated. They're homesick. They've only been here for a short while. But they're glad to stay, although they don't understand the world of nuclear energy any more than we do. And though they have no way of understanding what the test is all about. (speaking Marshallese) - [Voiceover] Rongerik itself lies some 200 miles almost due north of the main island of Kwajalein. Out here, in the peaceful Pacific where the natives sit in their courtesy and in their friendliness with their smiles and with their happiness, they aren't sure exactly what the atom bomb means, but at least they admit it. (foreign language singing) So you have "You Are My Sunshine" sung to you in Marshallese. Perhaps the top tune of the week, you might say out here on the tiny isle of Rongerik. - [Voiceover] In a moment, mutual and affiliated stations will take you to Bikini where Joint Task Force One has regrouped for the second time within a month. This time to set off the first underwater atom blast in the history of the world. - The bomb will not start a chain reaction in the water, converting it all to gas and letting all the ships on all the oceans drop down to the bottom. It will not blow out the bottom of the sea, and let all the water run down the hole. It will not destroy gravity. I am not an atomic playboy, as one of my critics labeled me, exploding these bombs to satisfy my personal whim. - [Voiceover] The evacuated ruler of Bikini, King Juda, gets a front row seat at the bomb blast as he arrives aboard the Mt. McKinley, and is greeted by Admiral Blandy, Joint Task Force One Commander. - [Voiceover] And the final switches have been thrown, no one can stop it, the atomic bomb is about to explode. We do not know how it's going to sound, but 42,000 men here are watching simply awaiting. All of the observer ships are in position in the open sea, they're about ten miles away. - Four, three, two, one. (peaceful island music) - [Voiceover] The entire targeted row, with the exception of one, two, three, four, five vessels were completely obliterated by the spray and the mist. Now everything has turned white, I can see nothing at all of the target vessels, they are all completely obliterated by the radioactive spray that is in the air. And all the time, mushrooming the very surface of the water that has taken an entirely different shape from the classic design of the mushroom which we knew. - [John] Sitting out there, apparently we were caught in what they call the downwind of this, and a lot of debris from fallout fell on top the Summoner. I was standing there and got a lot of mist, little grits of sand, pieces of rock falling around. And they ordered, what they called GQ, which is everybody go to the battle stations. We went down and I had picked up a little rock on the way that had fell down. And I picked up a little rock and I put it in my pocket. Didn't keep it very long, I guess I just threw it away. But again, within 10 hours after this test, Baker, we were at ground zero. - [Director] Scene 36, Take 5. - Doctor, what are we doing to protect our men in Bikini from possible harm? - In contrast to the Japanese, none of our men will enter the area until it is considered radiologically safe. Colonel Stafford Warren will head a staff of imminent radiologists who, with the aid of delicate scientific instruments will measure the amount of radiant energy that may be present. We are taking every precaution to be certain that no man is injured in any way as a result of this experiment. - [John] We didn't know of anything what was going on. No one told us about any radiation or been exposed to anything. We were really unconcerned about that, because we had gone aboard the target ships, and we thought that was one of the greatest things that there was on board there. We saw these men coming aboard ship, and they had these Geiger counters with them. They were walking all over the ship. They had regular shoes on but they had cloth pulled up over the shoes there they were walking around with. (Geiger counter clicking) I still had on a pair of shorts, and my tennis shoes, and I had a little t-shirt on with a sailor hat. And that's all the clothing that I had on me. - Scientists have a compelling interest in these new experiments. Each time an atomic bomb explodes, theory is translated into startling reality. Today's records and figures make tomorrow's textbooks. (Geiger counter static) - [John] We went swimming in the water, a lot of dead fish around. But we went swimming in the water. This water was also used for pulling through water from the bay and lagoon area there into the condensers of the ship to make our own drinking water. We used the water to wash our clothes with. We wasn't so worried about it, because they continued to tell us to not worry about any of this. It wouldn't harm us and we wasn't in any danger whatsoever. (Geiger counter static) - [Voiceover] Back to Washington comes Vice-Admiral William H.B. Blandy, the man who directed the two atom bombs tests in Bikini Atoll is here to report. In his first statement to the press, the admiral sounds a somewhat ominous note. - The Bikini tests, especially the second test, which involved the explosion of an atomic bomb underwater have proven that this bomb, as used in naval warfare, would be not only the most powerful, but the most insidious weapon ever used in history. I sincerely trust that a plan, which is at the same time practical and acceptable to all nations can be devised to outlaw it. But if this is not done, at least Crossroads will have given the United States information to make it better prepared than any other nation on Earth for this type of warfare. (Geiger counter static) - [Voiceover] The natives of the Marshall Islands have promised that they shall never use an atomic bomb against any enemy. They have further expressed their willingness and desire to join any world organization to outlaw the use of the atomic bomb in possible future warfare. These are a simple, honest, religious people. Peace-loving and not too wise on the ways of our civilized world. (speaking Marshallese) - [John] While we were on our way back to Pearl Harbor, why I was taking mostly bed rest at the time. And when I got to Pearl Harbor they then transferred me to the hospital there where many tests were performed on me. The Summoner left and went on another tour, of course I remained in the hospital. In 1947, they gave me a medical discharge and sent me home. My feet and legs were swollen only just a little bit. Sometimes it prevent me from wearing my shoes. And I would do as I was told to do. They told me that if my feet started swelling on me, I get bed and elevate my feet and legs, the swelling would go down, which it did. Years went on and this continued to go on and on. And years went on into the 50's. But each time the swelling would get just a little bit worse. My right leg went down, but my left leg continued to get big and it was swollen up huge, the size of the waist of a man. And it had started cracking open on me. And they had to take it off, because of the severity of the pain. And the many open wounds that was on it. And that was in '77, March of '77. One year later, the surgery right after that, the swelling began to go into my right leg. And it, again, the swelling wouldn't stop that time. It continued to swell so severely that it literally bursted open from my back of my knee all the way down to the ankle. And at that time, I was taken to the hospital, and it was August 1978, my right leg was amputated below the knee. Immediately after the amputation of my right leg, while in the hospital, my left hand began to swell on me. And they didn't have the answers for that either. There's no question in my mind that of all the things that went on in Operation Crossroads was me-- it was a slow death from that time to this date. Not only me but there's other thousands of men out there that may be even worse off than I am. There's so many thousands of those men that are dead now, and they don't really know what caused their death. (dreary music) - [Director] When I say action, don't start right away. Action! - The search of science for the absolute weapon has reached fruition in this country. But we stand ready to destroy this instrument. Let us not deceive ourselves, we must select world peace or world destruction. - [Director] Cut. (somber island music)
