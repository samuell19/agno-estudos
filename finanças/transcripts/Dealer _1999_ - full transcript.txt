Scenario: Thomas Arslan Around mid-day my work day begins. I had a rule: never to use myself the drugs I'm selling. We all worked for Hakan. I was his man of confidence. - How was your day today? - Alright. - Anything special happen? - Everything's okay. - Everything alright with the guys? - No problem. Take care they don't fuck up. Don't worry. In the evenings I tried in front of the discotheques. Late at night I returned home. Jale and Meral were asleep already. Give me a light. - What did you do yesterday? - I earned money for us. The usual then. There was a time when you didn't care where the money came from. What shall we live on then? Your income isn't even enough for you. You could at least look out for something else. - What? I can't find anything. - You don't even try. Can, how we go on like this? - D'you think it's fun for me? - What d'you want, a medal? - Can you be a bit earlier today for once? - I think so, why? I have to talk to you, it's important. I'm gonna be there. - Tell Eva that I'll pick the kid up an hour earlier. - I can do that. I'd rather do it, who knows what will get in your way again... Sit down and eat something. Bye sweetheart. See you this evening. You know you must eat something. Come on. - Eat up. - No... - Hi... - Jale will pick her up a bit earlier today. - A coffee? - No time, I've got something to do. See you later. - How much did he get? - Four years, the poor bugger... He should have been more careful. - Hi Can. - What's up? - Not much. - Not much? Nuri was stupid enough to let himself get caught with 8 kilos of shit... He was busted in his own apartment. - Four years for a few kilos of shit? - He's guilty himself, the idiot. - He talked way too much... - It can happen to anyone Dude! Nobody is safe from grasses... not even you. Yeah? I can detect a grass from 10 metres away... I can smell when there's something wrong with a guy. Hope you won't fall flat on your face one day... - Die hard idiot. - Fuck you Dude. - What are you doing here? - I need something. - Do you have money then? - Of course I have money. - That's new... - How much? I thought you were clean. What are you doing here? Wait a second... What are you doing here? I know what you're doing here. I don't want to see you here ever again. - Can I go now? - No. There are children living here... so if I see you one more time I'll call the police. You understand what I mean right? Fuck off! Hey Can! Can, wait a second... You can be relied on, always right place right time. What do you want Eldar? He's not talkative today the young guy. One doesn't talk to the cops, eh? - So what's up? - Not in that tone buddy. You don't talk like that to old friends. - What are you doing here? - Going for a walk, that's all. You chose a nice area. Are you a nature lover? - What's in your pockets? - Nothing. - Spread. - I don't deal anymore. - So you still have a Turkish passport. - Is it your business? Not at all. Quite a lot of money for somebody not working, eh? You want to mess with me? You're one of those stray dogs who sell around here, understand? We just let you alone because you were just shitting around, no more. That's over now. A few of you will go straight to jail straight. Very simple. You understand? You go to jail and I get my way. Understand? - Thanks for the cop's sermon... - I had to say it. Go on, get lost. Why do you waste your time with talking to that scum? What do you hope to gain with it? They don't listen to you anyway. You're just a fucking cop for them. In one ear out the other. Maybe. - What's up, what do you want? - Can we buy something from you? - Why d'you think we've something to sell? - The guys over there told us. I don't know you. We don't sell to people we don't know. - We're not from Berlin. Just visiting. - Where are you from? - Ludwigsburg. - Where? - Where's that? - Near Stuttgart. - You really want to have some fun now. - True. - What do you need? - Do you have cocaine? You want to enter straight. Of course we do, the best. And then... something like Hashish too. Something like Hashish... Are you used to it... I mean do you do it for the first time? - I already took some. - Well, you know then. How much? What do you mean? Guys, how much would you like to invest? Well, one hundred each. Not much, but okay for a start. Listen, we'll put together a small program for you. Cocaine to wake up, a few downers... some grass, some pills for free. - Alright? - Yeah. Say are you crazy, boy? Less conspicuous. - You're doing this for the first time, right? - Right. Listen, I give your order to the guys over there... then you can pick it up there. Here it goes like that. - But... - But what? - How do we know you won't take us in? - Fuck off... - Try somewhere else, fuck off... - Leave it be. Okay... We do as agreed. We'll pick up the stuff from the guys. - But inconspicuous. - Okay. - What's wrong? - What's wrong? You appear in the middle of the night and ask what's wrong. - What are you talking about? - We had an appointment. - I forgot. - You forgot? I had a lot on my plate. I just forgot. Just forgot. Say, don't I exist for you? - What? - Don't I exist for you? - Of course. - Then don't treat me like that. When I say it's important I mean it. I already told you, I had too much to do. I had to clear up a thousand things. Don't act like you're the only one having so much to do. I don't want to go on like this. I don't need this. What kind of life is this? Hanging around on the streets all the time. Listen, this will change soon. I'll talk to Hakan. He still owes me something. - What nonsense are you talking here? - I am serious about it. I'm serious too, idiot. I'll talk to Hakan... you'll see, something's gonna change. I've heard all this before. - I'm not in the mood for such stories. - It's not a story, I promise. Hey Can... - What's up? Don't you recognize me anymore? - Metin... How are you? I thought it was some asshole wanting something from me again. - Why, are you in trouble? - Forget it, it's not as bad as all that. - You look good, what are you doing? - I'm studying. - What are you doing? - Yeah man, student of law. Are you serious? Not possible... - You made it, you geek. - I'm still working in my parents' store. - And you? What are you doing? - A few things. This and that. Whatever there is. Right now, I'm looking for something new. - What exactly? - I don't care, whatever. If you really need something... Listen, my uncle has a restaurant. Sometimes, he's looking for people. - How about it? - We'll see. Think it over. Call me sometime. - Yeah? - Alright. - I have to go. - See you later. Take care. - Have you had any trouble? - No trouble. A cop headed me off... and talked my ear off. Told us we should get lost. They want to take drastic steps. The usual stuff... They just want to frighten us. - Do you have the money? - Mmmh. Hakan, I have to talk to you. - Go on, I'm here. - With you alone. So what's up? I've done the dirty work for you long enough. Dealing all day with these fucked-up guys... the constant trouble with the cops all the time. I'm fed up. Almost a year ago you promised me some change. So? I'm still running around on the street. You think I forgot about you? You really believe it, right? Can... You should trust me more. I dug you out of the mud, I gave you a job. Everything you learnt, you learnt from me! I made you what you are now. And without me, you're no more than dirt. Don't forget that. I'm just fed up with this job. I really need something else. I understand what you mean. Don't think I've never thought about it. It's not that I don't care about you. You want to get off the streets. Yeah, I know that. Soon I'm gonna take over a bar. The former owner is broke and is still in debt to me. You can work there as a manager. What do you say to that? - Sounds good. - Good. And when the time comes, we'll get you some new clothes. Do as I do. Dress better. D'you see this suit? Only the very best. As a manager you'll have to improve your appearance. This whole thing will take more time. All the paper work, that needs time... And when the time comes you'll climb up the ladder. Well? Sound good? I'm gonna show you the place. Sometime in the next few days... - What's going on with you? - Come along. - Where to? - You'll know soon enough. Tell me what's going on... - I talked to Hakan. - You talked to Hakan. And? I'm gonna take over a bar. I'll be the manager. - What bar? - I'll see tomorrow. It's a good address. - How did you get it? - With Hakan. - Is it Hakan's place? - Yeah, it'll belong to him soon. Can, what is this supposed to be when Hakan is involved? Hakan is alright. This is my chance. It'll get us out of this shit. This guy is full of shit. Since when do you believe what he tells you? You can't really believe that you'll be out of his dirty business? - He won't just give you the place out of friendship. - Give it a rest. You just don't understand. It's my one chance. - Your one chance... - Yes! - Is Hakan here yet? - Didn't show his face today. Can, have a look at what I've got here. - So what? - Any idea where I could sell it? Where's the other one? Which other one? - You're saying you've got just one? - Yeah. What are you supposed to do with one, you need two. Two! Hey Can, can you advance me something? You'll get the money tomorrow, promise. Not possible. You know it doesn't work like that. Make an exception. I'm broke today. Tomorrow you'll have the money. - Ask one of the others. - From those assholes I'll get nothing. But you can try with me, eh? I'm stupid enough. Come on, Can, you're different from the others. That's why I came to you. Seki... I don't have time now. Get lost. I wanted to change my life but I didn't know how. Now there was a chance. Where's the light... you can't see anything here. Come on, have a look. So what do you say? Did I promise too much? It's not in the best state now but when it's renovated... you won't recognize it anymore. I've got to clear something up. Wait outside for me. Well, give me something to drink first. - What'll it be? - From the one over there. - This one? - The next one. The brown one? No, the brown one. The brown one, that's what I said... so one from the brown one. - Exactly. - If you ask me... this area is dead. Nothing more to find. You're too late. You should have seen this place ten years ago. Even at this time of day no free seats... - And now? - When I need advice from you... I'll let you know. Can, this is between us, okay? Do your job as before and don't tell the others. - Sure. - See you. - What're you idiots waiting for? Drive on. - Wait, maybe he wants to buy something. - Seki, what are you doing here? - What do you want? You took us for new customers right? You getting on my nerves, get lost! Change your tone... What's up, you need something right? - Of course I need something. - That's lucky. - But I don't have any money. - That's bad. Too bad... What was that before? Why didn't you get in that guy's car? Of course you were too ugly when he saw you up close... Quite an ugly weirdo, our Seki... Leave me alone. - Don't make such a fuss you fag. - You're fucking crazy? What's all this? What did you say? Seki, you'd better apologize... Why don't you fuck off! - Well buddy, now you're in the frame... - Don't bother, I have nothing on me. Doesn't matter, we'll take you along anyway. Don't you have a child? - Answer. - Yes. - How old? - Three. You have a three year old, are previously convicted and dealing? What's up with you? Don't you realize that you're in serious trouble? If you want to walk out there you really have to offer me something. So come on, names, addresses, no matter what. What's that supposed to mean? You have nothing on me. I make you a gift! We don't have to find anything. We know you're dealing. So come on, I'm all ears. Can, think for a while, I know it's hard for you. Do you really think they would do the same for you? They're scum... You're just dirt to them, a piece of shit. You run yourself into the ground... and they take the money. Do you have a boy or a girl? If you're busted... you'll be put away for a few years. If you're unlucky... they'll deport you. How long is this supposed to go on? Why are you taking such great pains for that asshole? Let's foist something on him and put him behind bars. We know you're working for Hakan. You don't interest us. We want Hakan. When you bring us the information we'll leave you alone. Will you help me, brother? I have stomach cramps. Will you help me brother. I have stomach cramps. My God, just answer. My God, just answer. My God, just answer, Mahmoud. The next morning I was released. - Why did they put you behind bars? - They wanted to shake me down. - Did you have something on you? - I got rid of it before. What did they want from you? This cop Eldar... wants to corner me. - What did you tell them? - Nothing of course. Oh really? Are you sure? What's that supposed to mean Hakan? Do you think I would bullshit you? I'm thinking nothing... This guy's just bluffing. He's got nothing on me. - Why is this cop so keen on you? - How do I know. He knows me from before. - The cop's a friend of yours? - Hell no! He's just showing off. Playing the protector... You should choose your friends better. Fake friends can break your neck. Can! I'm your friend. Don't forget about that. - What are you doing? - Don't you see? What's that supposed to mean? I'm moving out. Can you tell me what's going on? There's no sense in explaining. I've tried a thousand times. - Maybe I've got something to say. - Don't bother. - The cops locked me up. No reason. - No reason... of course. Or else I wouldn't be out. It was pure bullying... It doesn't interest me. Calm down now. - I've already told you this will be over soon. - Yeah! But I'm fed up waiting for it. Where will you go? We'll live at Eva's to start with. Come on, unpack the stuff. Jale, unpack this stuff. What do you want to hear from me? - Shall I beg, down on my knees? - I don't want to hear anything from you. If you want, I could go somewhere else for a few days. - You can think things over. - There's nothing to think about. As you want. See for yourself how you get on. - Get lost! - I'm on my way. What was going on with me? I had so much on my mind. I tried to calm down a little bit. What do they want this time? Come here. Can, are you deaf or what? I said come here. Nice friends you have. What do you want from me this time? You're like a limpet. Leave me alone. Listen, you fool. I trying to help you. Get that into your thick skull? D'you want money? Or shares? What else d'you want? You stupid shit. If you want to do me a favour just leave me alone. It's not good for me to be seen with you this often. You'll get me in trouble. I don't need your help. - I'm as good as out of this. - Well, so much the better! Then you don't risk anything in telling me. Do you really think I'm that stupid? I've got something set up and I'm not gonna let it be ruined by you. I'm ruining it for you? Listen, if you go on like this, you'll be in serious trouble. Next time you run into us... you'll go to jail and not just for one night. I'm not a junkie you can blackmail with a few grams... Pretending to be a real gangster right? You all think of yourselves as something special... but you're all mistaken. In the end you're all gonna end up in jail... or on the game. Here you are... Think about it and call me. - How are you? - Not that good, Son. And Mum. Your mum is in hospital. A few days ago, she had another breakdown. After all the had work, our problems. The shop's not going too well. We're getting very few orders Besides, they're complaining about high prices. We have to sell the shop. Life's hard, even for your mother. You beat her again, didn't you? How could you ask me such a question, son? Is that the way to talk to your father? What could I do anyway? She was just lying on the bad, gazing at the ceiling. She hadn't the strength to move. Besides, our lives have changed a lot. How's the kid doing? - Fine. - And Jale? - She's fine too. - Are you getting along well with her? - Fine, yes. I'm gonna open a... Bar. A shame. You could have run our shop. Changed some things about it. Dad, you know I can't handle that work. I'm not suited to it. I hope it goes well, Son. Nowadays, it's good to have a job. And no one can live without art anyway. I brought Eva the money for Meral. - How is Jale? - Good. Isn't it way too cramped for you all? Don't worry about us. We get along quite well... - When will you bring the kid back? - I won't kidnap her, don't worry... I'll just go with her for a walk. We'll be back in a few hours. Jale will be back soon. I think it's better if you don't come in again. I understand. - Yes? - Can. I'm bringing back the kid. Oh! The lost son is back again... Where have you been? I tried to call you twice. Don't you use your beeper anymore? I shut the thing off. Had to take care of my family. You had to take care of your family. D'you know how much cash I lose a day when you're not working? - Is that all you can say? - Give it a rest. - Or were you hanging around again with your cop friend? - What? Can! I hear things of you I don't like. They lock you up, release you again... and shortly after you're seen talking to that guy. He's at me all the time. He's focused his attention on me. Decided to wear me down. And you of course, you stood firm. I begin to ask myself? What does he want from you? I already told you. He thinks he's my friend. - Always comes with the same old story. - He thinks he's your friend? Is it my fault? I don't know how to get rid of him... You should. I have to have trust in people working for me. You asked me a favor recently. I offered you something. You've the chance to take over a bar. And what are you doing? You spend more time with this cop than with anyone else... It disappoints me, Can. I've got nothing to tell them and this won't change. Can, don't fuck with me or you are in trouble. Damn, I'm no grass! That's to be hoped for, Can. - Ahmet wants to talk to you. - I'm coming. - Now! Kanakan, stop. Stop! Don't move. Well, Buddy, you're in debt, big time. Go get the money or else you're screwed. Believe me, I mean it. Go get it or else you're finished. Go get it, Buddy, or I'll screw your life. Hear me? Now fuck off! - Who were those guys? - That's none of your business! Did I wake you up? I'm sorry. Me? What do I want? I just wanted to hear your voice. Did you get the money for the kid? I brought it to your place. You got it? Good. Maybe we could see each other, sometime in the next few days. If you like to, I mean. Yes, I understand. You're probably right. Are you well? I'm well. And the kid too? Can I call you again? I know it's late and you're tired. I can understand that. Good. Yes. Sleep well. Yeah. Good. I had the feeling I was being followed by someone. - Who's there. - It's me. Open please. - What do you want? - I need your help. What are you doing here? I don't want you guys in my apartment, alright? Yeah sure, Can. I don't get anything from these idiots anymore. Assholes... They don't see what's going on. I'm not gay, just doing this to get money. They just don't understand. Seki, what's all this about? Why are you telling me this? I wanted to ask you a favor. Just one last time. I'm completely fucked up, man. I don't have money anymore and need something. No dice! It's an emergency or else I wouldn't be here... You're lucky my daughter's not here... otherwise I'd beat your brains out. You have no business here! You'll get the money in a few days. Definitely. Wait here. And don't try to steal anything. And don't move. Here. Now get lost. - Are you alone? - Yes. But what's it to do with you? By way of conversation... - Can I sleep here? I don't know where to go? - Nothing doing. Of course. It was just a question... - Now fuck off. - Okay. Everything went wrong. It became more and more difficult to do business. You could hardly move anymore. Get lost! - So you had a little dispute with Hakan? - I've no dispute with Hakan. - I heard otherwise. - Mmmh. The bar that Hakan promised you. He changed his mind about it. I heard you're outta there. Somebody else will get it. Who says that? - People. - What kind of people? Rumour has it. - Are you hungry? - I'm not hungry. I never see you eating. I told you, take better care of yourself. - There are problems... - There are always problems. The cops are getting serious. They're combing the whole area. I know. I can't do anything about it. There's something else. - Spit it out! - You promised me that bar. Now Murat tells me I'm outta there. Don't believe everything that little idiot's telling you. I already told you some will envy you. - Why are you talking with the cops? - I'm not saying anything. Hakan, do you really take me for a fucking snitch? I know just what I see and what my people are telling me. If I would take you for a snitch we wouldn't be sitting here... The thing with the bar is in progress. But you have to be more careful. Keep the cops at arm's length. You told me about your uncle. That he owns a restaurant and sometimes hires people. Do you remember? - Yes, of course. So what? - Can you do something about it? - I really need something. - It's possible. I'll have to ask him. - Would you do that for me? - Of course. I told you. But don't expect too much. Of course it's not a dream job. - The only thing... - What? Can, it's not my business what you're usually doing... - but I don't want any trouble, right? - I'm not gonna cause you any trouble. No trouble, alright? I don't wanna mess up with my uncle... Yeah, right. I'm going on a trip. I've booked a holiday. - Do you have a new guy? - I expected you to ask that. I'll go to the Portuguese coast with Eva and Meral. I have to get out of here. See something else. - You go on a trip? - Yes. Actually, I wanted to tell you something. - Don't keep me in suspense. - I'm out. - I found myself a job? - What kind of job? A regular job. In the kitchen of a restaurant. - Good on you! Really. - Don't you understand? It came like I promised you. I didn't tell you bullshit. That's not gonna change much now. What do you expect? You could move back with the kid. Or we're gonna look for another apartment. A better one. It's much too early. I don't want to think about it right now. What's that supposed to mean, too early? It works out well with Eva. She watches Meral when I'm not there. And Meral likes Eva. It's our kid, don't forget about that! - And you're the mother of our daughter. - Yeah? Just that? Let's wait and see. You must have patience for once. Okocha Amokachi A classic goal! Really beautifully played out... as if practiced ten times in training this morning. And look at this celebration now. I hate stinking like grease. I get a headache from it... - How long have you been in this hole? - 3 months. Three months? How do you stand it? - It's not that bad. - What are you saying? Standing there in the heat, in this stinking fug... - I've had worse jobs before. - Yeah? - Definitely. I've done every bullshit, bakery, hypermarket... shoveling snow in winter. I cleaned phone booths too. It was really nasty. You can't imagine how kinky that was. The stink, the puke... the saliva on the receivers. Really disgusting... I swear you if you'd done it just once. you'd never enter a phone booth again. Maybe... but something like this I can't face either. See what I look like. If somebody would see me like that... It's embarrassing. See you tomorrow. I decided to sell the rest of Hakan's ware. Can! You don't show yourself anymore. Do you know each other? That's Mehmet. I thought you weren't in town anymore. Why not? Where should I go, idiot? What's up with you? Where were you, last few days? Nowhere special. The usual... I was told somebody saw you in the kitchen of a restaurant... - working, in a kitchen apron. - You don't say! So? Who are you working for now? - For Nejan. - Never heard of him. You should get to know him. He took over Hakan's business now. He has something for you to do too. - Didn't you forget something? - What? Don't play the fool! The money you owe me... Spread your legs. Oh, you're careless. It's not much... but enough to begin with. You're a grass! What d'you mean? Are you crazy? What's in it for me? It's possible... - How are you? - Good. - Where's the kid? - She shouldn't see you like this. - How much did you get? - They gave me... - Four years. - Four years? Can... they'll deport you. - I don't have the right to ask for something from you... - What? When I'm out again... you could follow. If you want to, of course. I should wait till you're out again? Four years? After all that's happened? Are you really serious, asking me this? I'm going. Strange... how everything changes. Subtitles: Ratcha
