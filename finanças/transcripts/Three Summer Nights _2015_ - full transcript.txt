Take a look at these numb nuts. Do you call yourselves students? Why do you always go to girls' school and pick fights? We didn't fight because we wanted to... He's right we heard about the trench coat pervert and wanted to protect the girls. I don't believe it... Didn't I tell you to shave? Look your age! Look at yourself... Why were you there? Anywhere these two go... What? - I wasn't thinking anything! - Damn straight! Sir. For realization of justice we'll capture the pervert. Trust us. For the safety of our community! We'll do our best. There's no need for justice just concentrate on your studies. If you see injustice, keep on walking! These stupid morons! Wait for me! A man must do what he sets out to do. Yeah, let's get him for sure. That pervert. And you? I wanna see his third leg, I heard it's massive. Stop right there! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! This way! Move! Move! Move aside! I'm sorry! - Let's split! - Run! Pervert! Stop right there! Awesome! Who are you? - Turn yourself in. - What? You've watched one too many movies. Mister. Show us your third leg! Let go! Let go! Show us! Let go, you bastards! Not my pants! Let me see it. Stop it. We got you! Fugitive MA Ki-dong was captured by 3 high school boys. MA was hiding out when the boys went after him. Let's meet these brave students. Our homeroom teacher always said to us 'don't walk away from injustice' - 'for realization of justice'. - Caught by children? No, it just ain't cool. We had to capture the pervert and rescue the girl from him. That is amazing! CHA Myung-suk, WANG Hae-go and GU Dal-su they're no ordinary students let's hear what their dreams are. I want to become a computer programmer. Creating something... that anyone can... do something... Like, uh... Dr. Schweitzer, I want to do... good for people... but I'm not very smart. My dream is to become a superhero. To defeat those who pick on the weak I'll be a superhero. [Three Summer Night] Dodam PC customer service, how can I help you? [12 years later] My PC won't start. Sir, could you check if it's plugged in? Think I wouldn't plug in first? No, sir, it does happen from time to time... Listen to this bitch whine, I plugged it in! You take me for a sumbitch? Is this funny? Am I funny? No, not at all. Please calm down. How can I, you bitch! You think I'm a donkey dick! I'd never think of you as a donkey dick. So I'm not even a donkey dick? Listen to this guy playing semantics. Buddy, what's your name? I am GU Dal-su. OH Dal-su? The fat head actor? Yo, OH Dal-su! It's GU. Say what? - GU Dal-su. - Yeah, OH Dal-su! No, as in sticky goo. Are you making fun of me?! I was getting irritated, you're so dead! Dodam PC customer service. - All done? - Yes! She's the hottest porn star, you're good for 2 months. Her sensual oil play, licking the body all over... It's a masterpiece. - Lower the volume. - Sure. Erectile dysfunction patients'll love it. One moment. Good afternoon. Huh? Still here? Sir, here. 'Get Hard'? - Great name. - Get Hard! With so many Viagra clones, it's a free-for-all market. Get Hard is currently in clinical trial but with its release, it'll bring world peace! Hard! Have you used it? Come on sir, I haven't reached that age. I'm still young. Gonna stay? Sir? Yo buddy, did you really think I wouldn't plug in first? Have you checked, sir? It wasn't plugged in. I see, then could you plug it in? Don't wanna. Without plugging in, you can't start the PC. You take me for a fool? Are you lecturing me? Here... - What is it? - This is... to help relieve your stress, Busan Novotel suite! I got lunch meeting, so I'll see you later. Doctor... - Yo OH, get me your boss. - It's GU. Get me your boss, asshole! I'm not an asshole. Just get him, you pussy! You're really pissing me off! Then take a piss! - Still there? - What? Dr. JUNG signed a deal with NK Medical. What do you mean? I was just with him. Didn't you know he's a major jerk off? NK bought him a new car. What?! What are you doing here? Don't you get it? You don't lobby with such petty stuff. This isn't how business is conducted! Seul-gi, don't. - Wait, wait! - What?! You're late for your flight! Let's do it, I won't see you for a week. We can do it after you come back. No way! I can't! Come on! - Do it like this! - No... Come on! Can't get it up? It's not like that, I'm not feeling well. You're a pill pusher, try your products. We can never do it properly. Sorry. - Am I not attractive? - No, you're attractive. - Don't wanna fuck me? - No, I wanna fuck you. Do you know why I'm dating you? Why? Is your father really a CEO? It's embarrassing riding a busted ass car like this. Turn on the AC and let's go already! Put it on high, let's go. - I'll get a better car soon. - Shut up and go! Dal Shabet's awesome! Hi there! Hey, Ga-eun. Too skinny, Woohee. Serri's so cool! Subin, Jiyul, hi! Unky GU, didn't think you'd come. I have to, since you asked me to. Didn't you trip on live TV show? You saw? It was mortifying. That's not important. Are you okay? What is this? To rub on your sprains. Tiger extract! So cool! Photo op! Hey! No pictures. Seriously? Yeah! Ma'am, one moment. We got an event in Busan tomorrow. I know, Summer Party! Coming? Sure, I won't miss it for the world! Photo op! Could you move along please? Jiyul! Good luck! - You too, be happy! - Always! See you tomorrow! You're always righteous, always the just one. This isn't about that. - At my state... - Stop it already. We've been over this, I'm fed up. I'm spending my own hard-earned money it's not like I'm stealing! We only get married once, can't I spurge a little? Good evening! Hae-go. Dal-su. Can't you turn that off? How'd you describe yourselves? BFF. Good people? Let's be honest. You take someone studying for bar and go binge drinking. Still picking up girls posing as son of a CEO? Getting fired left and right, know what you're called? Freeloaders! Hey, Ji-young! No, I told you I got something to say. Hae-go, Dal-su. Stay away from him until his bar exam. Okay? I got you here for that reason, so eat as much as you want and if you need more, charge it to this card. I got a drinking meeting, so take my car home. Sure. - Bye. - See you. And use utensils when eating for once! Don't drool! Answer me in 10 seconds. Do you love her? She's the youngest woman to pass the bar and youngest start-up lawyer. We dated since law school. Her father's head of a hospital. She's a once-in-a-lifetime catch. - More than 10 seconds. - What? Answer the question. Do you love her? What? - Forget it, asshole. - Whose land is Dokdo Isle? - Our land! - Still sane. When I was in the military... Alright! Enough, enough. Forget it, asshole. Hey! Hey! How's your sex life... with Ji-young? Why is my sex life any of your business? The marriage is about... making shit ton of money at 50, and getting a trophy wife. Any girl before then is just a fuck buddy, like me. Don't get tied down and whipped by one woman. You still got the goods, just go fuck around. Be the alpha male. Let's go see the ocean! Ocean, big baby! What's he saying? He agrees with me. I have to go see Jiyul in Busan. I have to go to Busan! Busan? Sure, let's do it. No biggie. Check it Novotel suite! Is this real? Forget it, morons. Are we still in high school? Taking a trip to Busan for no reason. Drunk driving will get you killed. We can hire a driver! Like-minds! We're going to the beach! See you in Busan! I'm fucked! Who is it? No need to ask, it's the Wonder Woman! You bastard! I still got a year left on the contract! Let's not become slaves to these! Fuck it! Mine too! - Toss it! - Screw it! Fuck it! Throw it away! Dammit! I spilled beer! This is so fun! So frigging fun! What happened? Who did this! What the hell? Ladies and gents, this is the site of terrorism! Holy shit! This is amazing! Why didn't they take the car?! You're so dead! You son of a bitch! Shoulda taken the car! Nice angle, eh? I got everything. I had the foresight to record it. Taken apart in no time! Look at the speed, gone in a flash! How the heck did we sleep through it all? Who called the driver? Me. Why not give him a call? No cell phone. We tossed them. Oh yeah, that's right. But we got here on the cheap, $150, instead of $200. Great guy. But we lost everything! - Buddy. - Okay! I'm sorry! Since it's insured, Ji-young doesn't need to know. Think she wouldn't find out? - We're all dead. - Okay, let's go! Where? The beach! We're nearby! Myung-suk's so fucked, but beach is beach! Come here! You punks! Are you happy now? Awesome! Let's grab a spot, fill our bellies then battle mode. Let go, let go. Go away. Baby, I'm so sorry. Live the way you want, and I never want to see you. No, please! - Let go! - I can't live without you. Of course you can, you got a hot body. No, I can't! You can go on. You can. You see? Right? We still got a chance! Haeundae beach is full of love! Haeundae as its central location a new drug called GHB a hallucinogenic drug, is being circulated. With spike in recent rape cases we believe this drug has a part in it. What's more alarming is a large syndicate with national distribution could take over this drug. That is all. When does the operation begin? 2 PM today, at Haeundae. Catch them no matter what. Yes, sir. Cpt. KO. Can you handle this? Pardon? Sure, I'll do my best. Doing best isn't good enough nowadays. You gotta have the results. Yo. Nothing yet? Do we really need a parasol? Let's just join! I'll seduce the chicks, and we can join them. We'll buy fried chicken. Go seduce some squids. It's not like having a parasol will get us laid. Okay! Fine. Then let's get started. Pick up some bagels, and I'll get them all moist. What an idiot. You boys have fun. I'll back you guys up like there's no tomorrow. - Got it? - Yup! Go! Hey there! Let me get a good look at you. Go away! Shoulda said you had company! Let's go! Why're you youngsters look so down? Where's our fried chicken? My kids eat well, so we'll need 3 buckets. 2 fried, 1 sweet sauce. Everyone, report in. Have a good one. Report in. Captain, this isn't very practical how do we find the dealers among these vacationers? We'll sunburn to death. If there's even a 0.1% chance, we sit tight and wait. Keep your eyes open and scan your area. Nothing to report! Nothing to report! Nothing to report! Nothing to report! Nothing to report! We're seeing our tax money at work. They get pennies for salary, work long hours... Det. KIM's got same clothes from 2 days ago. No clean clothes? Det. KANG! I heard he failed the physical. Isn't det. PARK's wife run an art class? He'll be better off driving a bus for her. And where's our pretty and busty detective? Boss, what should I do? $1.5m deposit confirmed. Proceed. 2 suits in front of change room. Since we're here, let's at least dip our feet. - Let's get changed. - That is an exceptional call. - Come. - Sure. No, not the beach, the change room! We're in front, so come at once! Okay. Hey, stop it! Dal-su! You could be arrested for invasion of privacy. 5 years of imprisonment and at least $10,000 fine. Chicken delivery. 1 fried, 1 sweet sauce. That was so fast! We got 2 buckets? - Check it. - Pay the man. Do I look like a bank? You pay him. I'm poor. Do you accept credit card? It's on the house. Delivery complete. Okay, very good. Huh? They changed. Did you deliver to guys with tattoos? They were in suits, so I couldn't tell. Wrong delivery. Get it back! Computer programmer... to become a superhero. To defeat those who pick on the weak... Superhero... Screw you! How about the Hive? We got a hit, 11 o'clock! Deploy, deploy. - Where are the boys? - There, I think. I see them. Today's so hot. - Are you here alone? - Go away. We got a suite at Novotel hotel. We're with people. - Honey! - Hey. - Creep's hitting on us. - Who? They have company. Why don't they stay together then? Target in range, 3 singles, deploy Myung-suk. They're so fine. Let's all empty our pipes tonight! Do it! Do you have a sunburn, or are you always this hot? Mister, is that your pick up line? “Mister”? More like daddy, sugar daddy. Oh man, he's so funny. Listen here, we're here to have fun. But all the men here are college kids. And they're piss poor, can't even afford condoms. This guy is really forward. Better than beating around the bush. Look here. Alright, alright, here's the plan. Girls don't come down here with a bag full of money. Stop eating ramen, no more of that. You're on vacation, spurge for once. Come eat steaks with us. Steaks? - At Novotel suite! - Novotel! Stop it, it's embarrassing. He's so cool. Are you okay? Of course, a cut won't kill me. My god... You need to go to the hospital! No, no need. It stopped, it's okay. Done! Look, look. See them? Two boys over there. We can all have so much fun... Dammit... I need to pull it. - Oh my god! - Just go away! I'm okay. Help! You pervert! Are you nuts?! Where you going?! You're so dead! Myung-suk! Out of the way! Move! You okay? It was a mistake! You son of a bitch! Stop it! Stop it! Binoculars! Where are they?! It was a mistake! What's going on? Hae-go! Dal-su! You got a death wish? Fucking rat! Out of my way! Move! Move! What's happening? Dal-su! Those morons... This is peak season, you need reservation. And even if you're coming from the beach you can't walk in here in bathing suits. I got a suit on! - You call that a suit? - Put on a tie while at it. Good bye. They got room, but it's because of him. You can't wear flip flops. - Haven't you been to a hotel? - Let's leave. Watch it, lady! Busan? Honey, you really went overboard. If we don't pick anyone up, we deserve death! I'll get 'em! All of them! How's your foot? Come on, the light's turning! Cross! Cross! Son of a bitch! What the hell? Come on! Half of the population is chicks! Enough of this already! Are we so desperate to get laid? Let's act our age for once. One lies about his father, and the other chases after an idol. Way to go, guys! What about you? Who put you on high horse?! You're just a lap dog for a rich girlfriend. What? Bar exam? You'll never pass it. You've been prepping for years now. Just be her servant all your life. He may be a fuck-up but he's better than you. At least he's honest to himself! Asshole. You got a chick, so why're you so desperate? You'll end up with a limp dick! What? Fuck... You're right. I can't get it up. It's dead, asshole! Happy?! Fucking bastard... I don't know why I did everything, but nothing works! Do you know how that feels? So fucking embarrassing... Maybe it's better that way. I only shoot blanks. What the fuck is he saying? Tired? We're always like this, scraping the bottom. Crazy? Summer sunlight shines her radiant skin. Her curves drives me crazy. Crazy enough to offer my self esteem and manhood. Cheer up! Cheer up! He's into kinky shit? Yes, chairman!! I think the deal went bad, sir. I can't do banana tube part time at my age. Touch won't register, my fingers are bloated. What about me? I was out there too! I'm never getting married. Look at my sunburn, I look like a hick. Ow, ow, ow... This is awesome. I worked my butt off too, and not even an invite?! - Come join us! - You ate plenty of ice cream. - Join us. - Forget it. Hope you choke on a bone! It works! It's alive! Look, it's Novotel! What is it? Bikini party, free entry for bikini girls. I refuse to head back like this. I'm gonna get it up and pop a cherry. Drink this. What is it? There's a ton of it in the bag. Where was the bag switched? I had important stuff in there. It had all my essentials. Alright. Let's party till we drop dead. This is the beach of love! The number you've dialed is not in service... - Sweetie! - Seul-gi! Sweetie, sweetie! My baby! How was your flight? Came to see me? Of course! You missed me that much? - Let's go. - Where should we go? So annoying... Missed me? What's going on here? I know, I know. There's been some misunderstanding. It'll be resolved, so move aside. Do you hear yourself? This is bullshit! No one dares to cross the chairman. I said it'll be resolved, be patient. You backstabbing bastard! Hey baby, you girls are hot! Thought you were celebs. You'll give a lot of guys boners. They'll drink for free for life. Shit, the line's too long. We'll be here till sunrise. Follow me. You're frigging hot! What is it? Do you not see the people lined up? I do, but we gotta head to Seoul tomorrow. Let's go! No way, fat chance. What's with the shorts? First time at a club? If you want to go in, come back in bikinis. This is nuts, let's give it up. No, no, I'll never give up. I have to go inside! - We have to! - Get Hard, Get Hard! Yeah, we took Get Hard. He's really good at flame blowing. Special Forces, Special Forces. He's an ex-Special Forces, and he was a SEAL. We just forgot our tools. Please help us out. Sir... I know, I'll be in for a minute move aside. The chairman insisted that we only admit hotties tonight... I'm sorry, please go in! Let's end it quickly and have fun! Got it. Myung-suk, it's all up to you. All the hotties are here. That was awesome! No way... You son of a bitch! Hey! Hae-go, what's wrong? Are you fucking nuts?! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! You bastards! Stop right there! I must be nuts. This is harder than finding needle in a haystack. When I catch you, you die! Sons of bitches... You Seoul boys drink really well. Here, here. On the house, have a great time! Thank you! Thank you! I'm getting married. But why am I so sad? I wanna get married too! I'm so jealous. Is he only after the package? I don't know why he's so worked up. Boys. Let's move. Sir, there. Yo, MA Ki-dong! - You can't! - Just a moment! - You can't come in! - Why not?! Holy cow! Only bikinis are allowed in. Why'd anyone wear bikinis here? You can borrow a set. - Hey sweetie. - Hey, babe. It's the apocalypse. Have you seen these boys? Wait, they're... Know them? What is that? He won't fit in there. I had heard of disputes with my boys. It was a misunderstanding. I only have one rule. Bring a knife to a knife fight and a pussy to an orgy. I too have one rule. No credit. As per your reputation, you got balls. I will bring what's yours, very soon. I know you're a man of your word. Since I'm in Busan, I'll wait and eat some sashimi. Do you need anything? This one's tiny, it's on the house. It's hard. What? Hard. What's he talking about? Yo. I'm a pervert. I wanna see... I wanna see Jiyul. Want a hug? A pervert and an idiot. And me? Every man for himself from here on. How did you get here? I got good intuition. Sit down! Be honest, are you here alone? No, we never planned to come here since the exam is just around the corner I thought I needed to calm my nerves somehow. So we drank, and we ended up here... and you're sexy as hell. What? I'm sorry, I know you're mad. Forget it. Is studying that difficult? You needed to blow off steam. Taking off when stress gets to you. Only then you'll do big things in life. Since we're in Busan, let's grab a drink. Yeah... You must really like spoon worm. You ate $200 worth alone. - The thing is... - Yes? I know this is too forward of me but how far will you go with a man you just met? Well... Depends on who it is, my panties could slide off. I'm the right guy for that! What I mean is... I'm in a bind couldn't we do it first, then get to know each... - Desperate? - Yes. Very desperate. How desperate? How desperate? Incredibly, unimaginably, deeply, phenomenally. I have to tell you... I may end up disappointing you. Dammit! Ji-young! Let me sleep! What the hell is this? - My arm is so numb. - I'm tied up. Hae-go, untie me, I'm not kidding around. - Where am I? - What is this? You're dead when I get out! - Where are we! - What's going on! Hey, shut your mouth! Where am I?! - Help! - Help me! I can't breathe! Down. Up. You bastards! What's going on? Who are you? I dunno what's going on, but I'm sorry. Mister, untie me! Ji-young! Why are you here?! Awake now? Sir, please... Wet fucking rats. Where's the bag? Bag? What bag? Whose bag? Did you sell it? If you want to save her, bring the bag back. No cops. Call me. Let's go. Whose idea was it to come here? Whose idea was it?! Why're things so fucked up when we wake up?! Good morning, thanks for coming in. Sit down, please. I'll be taking over unit 3's GHB case effective immediately. Sit down, I know you're tired. You got a bad sunburn. Captain, we're not in the '70s. No more wasting manpower and time on baseless tactics. Now these are the suspects on the beach yesterday. Waiting for the exchange. Deal is over in a flash and they walked away with the money. They're incredibly smart individuals. Even after their cover is blown, they don't flinch. Send out an APB, and arrest them on sight. I guarantee a promotion with the arrest. Let's get this done! Not here! Nothing! - Anything? - Nothing. What do we do? You were carrying it! It only had those energy drinks! We should call 911! You call yourself a friend? What if you get Ji-young killed? - Whose land is Dokdo Isle? - Our land! Do you love her? I do! I fucking do! She came here for me, and now she's in danger. You had it, where the hell is it?! Dunno, dunno, dunno! Don't remember! At all! Who is it? Room service. This is invasion of my privacy I'll never talk. I just know I didn't have it. They must've ransacked the suite. Suite? Who were you with? I can't tell you! Bad things will happen! The sashimi place. We must've left it there. Look at ourselves, get changed first! Sashimi place! It was this room. Okay. Look around. Yu-sun? Come back at night. What the heck did you do to her last night? I dunno. I don't remember. - Are you married? - Desperate? How far will you go with a man you just met? Incredibly, unimaginably, deeply, phenomenally. I really want to do it. Did you force it on her? Aren't you impotent? It's nothing like that! Boss, have some fried chicken. Don't feel like it. No need to worry. I'll let you go when your man brings my stuff. What? What'll happen to Myung-suk? Myung-suk? Oh, the superhero? Well, I wonder... Fish food, I bet. I'll pay for your stuff, please let him live. No, no. It's not about the money. It's about my reputation. My rep comes before money. Is he after the merchandize, or those boys? They have the stuff, so he's after the goods. But it feels like he's fixated on them. No way, I doubt that. I'm starving. 2 spicy noodles, and black bean noodles for you. I don't believe this. Rooms are only $15 during the day. Stop your bullcrap! I don't get it, it's here somewhere. Come on! Dal-su, check out this one. We'll never find it this way. Myung-suk! Where is it... We're finished... All the rooms are full, everyone's fucking. We got a phone. Can't you ask Ji-young? Yeah, let's call him and ask. Hi there, could I talk to Ji-young? Goddammit! Give it! I'll do it. Hello? - Found it? - Could you put Ji-young on? Why? She may know where the bag is. Is that Myung-suk? Hello? - Honey, are you okay? - Yeah, and you? Yeah, I'm doing okay but what's the motel we went to last night? What motel? I was really drunk and can't really remember. I know it's nearby. You goddamn son of a bitch! Buddy! I was kidnapped at the club and have been here since! You cheated on me? Why aren't you answering? That's a confirmation. You lying and cheating asshole I'll kill you myself! Shit, hello? Hello? It's disconnected, call him again! That bastard! Call him again! Now! I can't believe he did that to me! Mister, get them and kill them, I'll pay you guys! You have to! I don't believe it, how could he cheat on me! Holy shit... I'm sorry. Hey! I'm fucked. It's okay. Should we... still look around? How did you get here? Maybe we had a connection. Did you come alone? Never planned to come here, but the exam is just around... You're sex as hell. I mean... You must've been so tired. It's okay, I understand. Since we're here, shall we get a drink? Yeah... Shall we? Come on. Was it a wild night? Was it fun? Like this? Huh? This is no time to make fun! He transformed into Don Juan overnight! Who was the chick, and those 2 guys? Remember anything? Hold on, I'm trying to think. We didn't even drink that much. Less than our usual amount. Then how could we blank out completely? Did I drink that much? No, it wasn't even close to our limit. And you? What the heck happened? The police released CCTV footage of the suspects and asked for public's assistance. These 3 suspects are based in Seoul and are targeting Busan since it's a prime destination. They were seen on Haeundae beach and they're likely to appear at motels and bars. KNN's HONG Hee-won. What did you do?! Speak the hell up! I'm sure you took it! Think carefully! We could be arrested for dealing, that's over 5 years in prison! I'll talk! Grab him! I'll kill you! Let go! Stop it! I'm serious! Really! You expect us to believe that?! I'm super serious! You got laid? By an idol? I bet African famine's over and there's world peace! Go check it out for yourself! But the media cannot know about this! Didn't you just eat? Haeundae beach drug dealing suspects spotted. Reported by motel owner, requesting support. Don't get caught, stay free Myung-suk! I'll kill you myself, you bastard... What's with you? - What? - “What”? It's your boyfriend, don't you feel bad? Feel bad for what? He slept with someone else! Just wait till I get my hands on him... Bring the bag, he dies, don't bring the bag, he dies. Fine, do whatever you please. You're the same, listen carefully! Criminal law article 29, clause 276 5 years of imprisonment and $7,000 fine for kidnapping. If I spill a drop of blood that's an assault, which is 7 years. I dare you to threaten me with something. You're just petty hooligans who beat up children and what's with this chicken shop? This isn't you, just give it up. She's fearless. Isn't that police walkie talkie? Are you permitted? Boys, remove her. “Remove” me? Am I piece of trash? - Hello? - Don't talk to me like that. - I'm speechless. - One second please. Hey, what are you doing! Stop it! Let go! Boss, the chairman is requesting an update. Set up a meeting today. Sir? Why're there so many cops? - Did you cause a stink?! - No way! - Shut the hell up! - The media can't know! Is that the only entrance? Who cares, follow me. Now! We can't just march in! Okay, call her, now! Fine, fine, calm down. - Don't rush me. - It's her. Jiyul! It's unky GU! Jiyul! Jiyul! Jiyul! - Hey! - Huh? Hey! What is it? Wait for me there! Pardon me. You left this behind. I believe that there was a misunderstanding. Did you see a bag by any chance? No, but my suite was rummaged, was it because of it? - Come on, let's go. - Where? - Upstairs, quiet. - What for? Just a minute! - Is it recording? - Yes. Are you sobering up? I'll take a shower too. Why did the manager have your camcorder? Do you remember anything?! Concentrate! Something's not right! Unky GU, you'll catch cold. Up close, your side profile is so pretty. Me? This side. And this side too. All so pretty. Stop it, I felt everything! Jiyul? You're not her! Don't come closer! Jiyul? No, please! What is that? That's bad, don't do it! You're not Jiyul! The manager? Stop! That stings! What is this sensation? It feels good, electrifying! On my side? I wanted this! That sound! Harder! Higher, my back! What's that? The tiger? Tiger extract. Tiger extract? What will you do with it? So scathing! More, that feels good! Such exhilaration! You're the best! Is it over? What are you doing? Do you love me? What? Tell me that you love me! - I love you! - Louder! I love you! No way... He's... such a lovable man. I heard he crashed your party that night. It was a party for drinking and dancing. 'Crash' is too harsh a word. Jiyul! Unky's here! I'm here! Jiyul! Chasing after idols in their 30s may seem like a crazy thing to do but those men are all so pure. It's a heartless world, and they got nowhere to turn. I must be mad! Not at all. You can marry her. Why'd I marry her?! I'm not insane! I can't believe this! I've kept my chastity for 30 years! Really?! Well, kind of. I did once or twice but still... I don't get it. What's big deal about those damn energy drinks?! Goddammit! Even this shellfish is hard what's wrong with me? Am I less than a spoon worm? Go home, I need to close up. Listen! If I was a spoon worm, would you treat me the same? If you were, I'd have eaten you. Why? Why? Why eat a spoon worm? Eat me instead. What a crude man! Go wash that filthy mouth! You need to leave! I feel so dirty! I will! Reborn as a spoon worm. Eat me then! Where did she go? What I'm saying is he got drunk at our restaurant. So she tugged him in. What's wrong with you! Don't worry about it! Then he woke up all of sudden and just took off. She was worried and followed him outside. Then some men came in and completely trashed my place, those worthless pricks! Yeah, worthless pricks! We'll get 'em! I don't remember much, but they're good guys. How'd you know that? He's a good man who loves spoon worms. Spoon worm? I didn't do it! I didn't! Or did I? Dammit! You absolutely did, if you're talking like that. I did? Dude! Where you going? What is it? What? What? Is this it? We found it! Energy drinks! Hello? We found the bag! Yeah? Then bring it. And? You gotta tell me where?! Yes, hello? Sorry. I've been preoccupied. Come to Dongbaek Isle. You got an hour. What about my Ji-young! Inspector HAN! We got the wrong men! We got them on CCTV, they're dead to rights. I just know it's not them! On what basis? We got evidence. Come on! Inspector! We got a tip that they'll be at Dongbaek Isle. What should I do? Hey! Open up! I don't believe it... What's the point of biometrics if it doesn't work? Or is it just me? Holy crap! There's no one here, what's with the fan?! I'm so pissed off! Hot dang! What is that? Chief, isn't that a bug? It's so hot, good evening. Have some chicken, sir. I got fried chicken. Great work, detectives. I'll leave the rest here. Who ordered the chicken? What? Who ordered it last night?! Wasn't that you? Popsicles! Nothing to report. Nothing out of the ordinary. The suspect is approaching. Should I grab him? Sit tight. Mr. Chairman. Does sea breeze feel nice? What's the meaning of this? I didn't think I needed to be there. You only need the product. It's good. When you're behind bars, I'll send fresh sashimi often. What are you talking about? Did you senility take away your intuition? Get them! MA Ki-dong, you bastard! It's him, get him! Get him! You got nowhere to go! Boss, the plan went haywire. The old fart is arrested but the boy took off. Remember me? You bitch! Stop! The chicken delivery scooter leaving the isle! Track him on CCTV! Your goal wasn't the money? Leave the past in the past. It was a trauma that can't be left behind. Trauma? What a full of crap. Why do you only remember your pain? Did you ever consider the pain of others that you've caused? Who are you? Turn yourself in. There's nowhere else to go. After that day I was too scared to leave the house or eat anything. But those boys were the only ones who visited me everyday and cheered me up. Especially Myung-suk... He stood by me patiently until I was back to normal. But how could he sleep with another woman? Is he insane? Take my hand. Okay. So? As men, let's see this through! Where? Hey! Where you going?! Let's go! Where's Ji-young? Ji-young! - Ji-young! - Honey! Welcome. Where's my girl?! Ji-young! Hey! - Baby! - Calm down! Let go of me! The bag. Is that money? Yeah, those are bonds. - Could've been ours. - Shut it! Boss, it's all here. Alright, free her at once. At least ungag her! You son of a bitch! Do you know what I went through?! I'll kill all of you! I'll get you back! Untie me, you douchebags! Gag her. Yeah, let's do that. A long, long time ago. There was a snot-nosed kid. He had no money for lunch, so he'd go to the water fountain and filled his belly. Then he heard that he'd get some food by joining the wrestling team. He was actually pretty good at it too. You assholes, untie me! With a medal, he could go to high school and earn money too so he trained with all his might. I'm sliding down! Untie me! But the coach's son was picked for the tournament. He wasn't even worth a spar. A feeble kid. So full of shit. It's your lack of talent that should be blamed. Stop blaming others and untie me! I knew it then. How unfair this world really was. Write your biography at home, and untie Ji-young! What are you doing?! Shall we settle your debt? What debt? Did you lend us money?! Restoring my reputation. What? You wanna wrestle? If any one of you beat us she lives. But with each loss, we cut a rope. And you know what happens next. Don't wanna? Wait! Okay! Okay! Okay... Myung-suk! Hurry up! Bring it! What a fucking sight. Lower me and do it. Foul! Foul! We need to shake on it! Sorry, sorry. Force of habit, let's shake. Come here. Point! Can you boys take this seriously? I'm about to die here, do you know how scary this is? Just beat one person! I'm so scared... How long do I have to stay up here? Wait! Substitution. What? - Bud. - Why? Let's end it here. Wait! In normal situation, we should have the last fight. I felt like it. Get back in. You guys look funny from up here. Dal-su. Your opponent. When it's over, it'll be different. You'll be sucked in, you're my big baby. - Big baby! - Hey, hey! What are you doing?! What a pervert. He looks so dirty. So you're the big boss? Is this a joke? Are you having fun? Shake. Fine. I feel it, I feel it now! Throw move? Come on! Foul! Why? Why's that foul? Goddammit! Is this right? This doesn't feel right. What is this odd sensation? Back up! Hard! You're hard! Back up! Damn that's loud! Everyone! Freeze! No one moves! Don't move! I got you! Selling fried chicken got you that nice car? I said don't move, asshole! I'll shoot your ass! Don't even move your eyelid! My dear Ki-dong, you really did it this time! Mister! Mister! Over here! Please lower me, it's really tiring up here. Why the heck are you up there? They tied me up and dangled me up here! Hurry up! Bring her down! Right this second! Hurry the hell up! Bring her down! Easy, Dal-su! What happened? Bastard! Don't go! I'll be right back, take care of her. Hey! Two, three, one, two, three, four! One, two three four. Out of my way! Bastard! Out of my way! Stay away from me! Make way! What do you think you're doing? Boys, stop that man. He's a bad man! Evil mustache! What is it? What's the matter? Out of my way. What the hell! Stop it! You bastards! Stop! Sons of bitches! Yo. Bastards! Why high school kids again?! Here. You lost them, didn't you? But how? She was picked up while looking for her prey. She's an infamous fox around here. Here she comes. Wait! One moment. Please stay back. I drank too much... Baby. Don't do that, I have to go... Go where? We haven't started yet. Ji-young, Ji-young... I drank too... Nothing happened, so don't worry. You got a good man. Idiot... Move. Hae-go, Dal-su. I'm not a woman who doesn't get camaraderie between men. I'm trying really hard to understand... Dal-su, can you turn that off? Who cares, it's to capture our memory! It's okay, keep shooting. Fine, let's drink. You boys drink up, we'll take my car back. I'll be the designated driver. You assholes! Where to! I'll see you in a bit! Bastards! Dal-su! You're the only one who can get me hard! Only you, Yu-sun no one else! My body reacts! Hey, bud. Good afternoon. Yu-sun! Yes, bro! Should we clear out? Not at all! I'm being honest, truly. I really... want to go out with you. It's getting late today so stay for a meal or not. Come tomorrow... No, no way. I came to tell you something. Come with me for a bit. What's wrong with you! Stop it! Go away! Please! Don't follow me! GU Dal-su! Stop! - Stop right there! - Don't hit me! Don't follow me! GU Dal-su! You'll hit me again! It hurts! Let's talk about it! Why're you doing this to me! Please go away! Why are you avoiding me? You said you loved me last night. No! It's tainted love! Drugged perversion! No! It's still love! Love? Come here! No! No! It can't be! Dal-su! Come here! I was due back tomorrow didn't need to come here. You don't trust me? You're the last person I'll trust in this world. Why? You never tell me anything, but your friends everything. Why can't you tell me that you're tired? Didn't want you to worry. That you'd be disappointed in me. I'll never be disappointed in you. I'll never give up on you. Like you, I'll chase you to the end of the world and worry. I've been down lately. What am I good at? What do I want to do? I wanted to find out. So what is it that you want to do? I don't know. I wanna start looking now. Will you wait until I find it? How long will I have to wait? Well... Until I find my dream? Ji-young! I love you! Please wait for me! I love you!
