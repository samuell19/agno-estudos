Pete, Joe. You're doing a fine job. Keep up the good work. - Hey dudes, check you later. - We're gonna lay you out tomorrow. - Yeah, we'll be there. (basketballs thudding) - You gotta work tonight? - Yeah. - You dad find a job yet? - No. - Oh. (whimsical music) (basketballs thudding) (woman gasping) (basketball thudding) - [Joe] Anne Marie. What are you doing talking to him like that? - Sorry, sorry! I didn't expect you to do this. Come Joe, leave me alone. - Expect me to see what? - Hey, my man! How you doing? - Hi. - I was wondering if you, want a job? - Umm... (Joe and Anne Marie arguing) - I need a bright kid in the junior high to, well, deliver some goods. - I'm sorry Mr. Sedler, I'm busy. - No? Well, think about it, Petey. A lot of other kids would jump at the chance. - Yeah. - It's a great opportunity and the pay is real good. Think it over. - What did he want? - Me. - Pete. - Yuck! - Listen, I gotta go to work. I'll see you. - Yeah. (basketball thuds) - Pete? Thanks. - For what? - Not asking about Anne Marie. - Nah. - [Celia] Put away the bottle. Just don't drink anymore tonight. - [Jake] I'll do whatever I want. - [Anne Marie] (sobbing) You'll wake the neighbors! - [Jake] Who cares! - [Joe] Come on Dad, let's get you to bed. - [Jake] I'm not sleepy, and get your hands off me! - [Anne Marie] Mom, let him alone. - [Celia] (sobbing) Jake honey, come on now. (punch thudding) (Celia crying) - [Anne Marie] Don't worry Mom, it'll be all right. You pig! - [Jake] You! You don't talk to me that way. I'll teach you how to talk to your father! - No! - Come on Dad, come on! - [Jake] She can't talk to me that way! - [Joe] She didn't mean it. - [Jake] Nobody talks to a Corelli that way! - [Anne Marie] No, Dad, no! (Anne Marie crying) - [Pete] Your dad didn't get the job? - [Joe] No. - Like a bottle of pop? - It's okay Pete, I'm used to it. - I'd never get used to it. - You know, it was harder before the Lord found me. - [Pete] Yeah? - Yeah. - Well, you're out here an awful lot. - I like it out here. I think better. I'm closer to Jesus out here. - Joe, it's okay if you talk to me like that, but some of the other kids might think you were a little... Weird. - Because I love the Lord? - Because you talk about it. - [Joe] Yeah? - Yeah. - That's funny. I didn't think loving the Lord was supposed to be such a secret. - Yeah, well, sure. I'm a Christian and all, but you gotta use a little sense. - I see. I should only talk about girls and basketball to the other guys. - Cut it out Joe, you know what I mean. - I know.

Are you in? - I'm in. - [Pete] Meet you in the hall at eight? (vehicle humming) Hey. Get some sleep. - Yeah? - Yeah. (Joe whistling "I Will Serve Thee") - [Pete Voiceover] Lord, Joe's into this pretty heavy. But I can't cut it like that, okay? (Joe whistling "I Will Serve Thee") (Joe sobbing lightly) - We're expanding our youth program this year. Especially our program for teenagers, our Friday night teen club, our teen choir, our athletic program, and our new youth life series. - [Joe] What's that? - That's a program where young people come and solve problems. We have these great people, former addicts that have kicked the drug habit. - How does it work? - [Connors] Kids come here and learn how the Lord can help them, or we take the Word of the Lord to them. Once they have known Him, nothing is impossible. - What if they don't wanna know the Lord? - Oh, they wanna know Him, Joe. - Well maybe they think no one can forgive them. - Many of them think that, but we help them to realize that the Lord loves them no matter what they've done. If they confess their sins to Him, He'll forgive them, give them eternal life, and lift them out of their problems. - When do you start? - Hey Joe, it's noon. - [Joe] I gotta split, Pastor. Time for work. I gotta think of how to, tell someone. - I'm always here. - I can't be late. I'll let you know, I gotta run. (ominous music) - Hi Joe. I got a little job for you. - I got a job. - Right, and that job's gonna make you even more money. I want you to press the drug store key into this and get a nice, clear impression. Understand? - I'm not gonna help you break into the drug store, Ben. - Take it, Joe. I'm a little short of supplies. I need it, and so does your sister. He'll do it. He won't have any choice, once we talk to his sister. - Talk? (men laughing) (ominous music) (Anne Marie gasping) - [Benny] Give this to your brother. Until I get what I want, you don't get what you want. (Anne Marie sniffling) - [Joe] Anybody home? - [Anne Marie] Mom's at Aunt Ellen's. Who knows where he is. - Is there anything to eat? - [Anne Marie] Joe, I've gotta talk to you. - I've got something to tell you about. - [Anne Marie] This is important. - Okay, you first. Anne Marie! - Joe. You've got to do it. - You're asking me to steal for Benny! - I have to, I mean, you've got to do it. You've got to. - No! I don't steal! - What difference does it make? - Why are you asking me to do this? - He's got something I need. - Drugs. - Yes. - That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I know about some people that had the same experience in drugs and they found help. - How? - By coming to the Lord. - Oh no. - [Joe] Pastor Connors said they could help you. - You're talking about me to that preacher? - I didn't say who you were. I-- - Get away from me, you stoolie, you fink! I need your help! I'm not gonna be treated like a freak! (Joe grunts) Drop dead, creep! - Please listen, Anne Marie! (sorrowful music) - Do it for me, Joey. - I can't. It's wrong. - (gasping) What difference does it make? - [Joe] It makes a big difference to the Lord. - (sobbing) Oh, don't start that stuff again. - He loves you, Anne Marie. - I hate myself. - You hate your sinning, and He hates sin too. But He loves you. Tell Him you're sorry. Accept Him as your Savior, and he'll help you like He did those friends of Pastor Connors. - (sobbing) But I'm too messed up. - He died for our sins, so we can't get too messed up for Him to forgive us. He loves you, I know. - [Anne Marie] Go away (sobbing)! (door creaking) - I can use another pair of hands. - I need your help. - That's what I'm here for. - [Joe] She said the Lord couldn't help her. And I couldn't make her listen. I couldn't help her. - You want me to try? - Please. - Let's go. - No! - Once you know the Lord as your Savior, He'll give you all the help that you need to kick this rotten habit. He gives you life. What you're doing is a slow, painful way to death. - Go back to your church, Preacher! - Here's where I'm needed! - You don't have what I need. - I don't, but our Savior does. - [Joe] Anne Marie. - [Anne Marie] Get him out of here, Joe! - [Connors] Are you afraid to try, Anne Marie? - Get out! - Anne Marie! - [Jake] You heard my little girl, Buster. Out! - Dad! - [Connors] Wait a minute, Mr. Corelli! - [Jake] Out, before I break your hand! Out! (Jake laughing) (door slamming) - [Anne Marie] Well, I told him to leave. - [Connors] Wait a minute till I clear my head. (Connors breathing deeply) - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Your father must've been a great tackle back in school. - [Joe] He was. (sighs) Well, I guess that does it. - We can't stop this easily. - You gonna take on Dad again? - I think I know someone who could help us. - [Joe] Who? I don't know. - It's up to you, Joe. - Believe me Joe, the best way to help your sister and other kids is to nail the guys who sell the stuff. Better yet, nail the ones who sell to the sellers. - But, that makes me a stoolie. A fink. - Do you wanna help your sister or do you just wanna talk about it? - She'll hate me. She does now. I just wanna do what's right. What's right? - I think Joe needs to think it over a little. Thanks for your time. - [Officer] Not at all. Think on it, Joe. We're here. - Thanks. (crickets chirping) (Joe whistling "I Will Serve Thee") (whistle tweeting) - [Coach] Okay Corelli, let's take that one again. (whistle tweeting) Okay, hit the showers. Pete. Joe. Are you guys all right? - (panting) Sorry, Coach. - Well, why don't you go home and get some rest? - I know, I know. - Stay up too late on that roof, whistling that darn night song of yours. - [Joe] Yeah? - [Pete] Yeah. (door creaking) (locker doors slamming) - Hey, Pete? I need your help. - [Pete] Yeah? - [Joe] Yeah. - [Pete] No! It scares me out of my head. - [Joe] Man, when the Lord wants you to fight a battle, he gives you the strength. The Bible says you gotta be strong in the Lord and the power of His might. - [Pete] Hey man, I got trouble being strong in myself. - [Joe] Well, that's why you need the Lord. - [Pete] Yeah? - [Joe] Yeah! - [Pete] I mean, I'm scared. - [Joe] Me too. - [Pete] You know, forget it. - [Joe] Do you know what's happening to my sister? - [Peter] Do you know what happens to a stoolie? (Pete and Joe panting) - Are we friends or not? - Come on, Joe. - Pete, please! Okay. - Joe. Okay, okay. - Aw, thanks Pete! Listen, it'll work out fine, you'll see. - Yeah? - Yeah! (dramatic music) (Anne Marie slapping) (door creaking) (sorrowful music) - [Pete] Anne Marie again? Great. - I'd give my life for Anne Marie. Pray with me. - Here? Joe-- - Please. Help us Lord, to help my sister. Bring her to You. We just gotta get this trouble off our streets so other kids don't get messed up. You know what's happening. Use me, any way You want to to get the job done. I know You can do it. And Pete does too. We ask this in Jesus name. - Amen. Now what? - We find Benny. - And hope he doesn't find us. - Have faith, Pete. - Lord, I don't know if I'm up to this. (jazzy music) (men laughing) - Did you see that jive turkey in the bar say he wasn't gonna pay until Banjo just switched out his knife? - Banjo's got a cool knife. - You cats been doing real good with your payments. Real good, except for Freddy. - [Cohort] Well listen, I talked to Freddy the other day and I said, "Either you pay up or I'm gonna break your arm." - I haven't gotten a payment yet. - That's because he's in the hospital with a broken arm. (men laughing) - Hey, you should let me handle it, Boss. I'd have got the money first before I broke his arm. - You always putting me down, Banjo. - That's because you're stupid. - Come here, little man! - Shut up, both of you! (bell ringing) (Pete and Joe panting) - [Joe] We'll try again tomorrow night. - [Pete] I can't wait. The coach is really gonna be impressed with my reflexes tomorrow. (door slamming) (Pete thudding to floor) (ball thudding) - Corelli! Is what you and Joe have catching? - Sorry, Coach. - I'd like to talk to you two about your training habits. That is, if you can stay awake long enough. Clarkson! (ominous music) (cat meowing) (trash can clanking) - [Benny] What's that? (cat meowing) - Just a cat. - [Banjo] I used to hang cats up when I was a kid and practice on them. I wonder if I'm still good at hitting them. - Bet you five you can't hit it. - You dudes better get going. If you're late, it'll cost us more than that. (cat meowing) (cat meowing) - [Pete] Sorry about that, cat. (trash lid clanks) (Joe and Pete panting) Don't tell me. I know. We'll try again tomorrow. Yeah? - [Joe] Yeah. (locker door slams) (coach smashing doors) - [Pete Voiceover] Lord, could you rap a little with the coach, before he throws us off the team? (calm music) - This is it, they're waiting for somebody. - [Pete] Probably some drugs. - No, look! That's the man. I gotta see better. - Joe! - Stay here. (suspenseful music) (can clinking) - [Benny] That's no cat! (car wheels squealing) Go that way! (fence rattling) (knife thudding) That was stupid! - [Banjo] Well, I had to think fast! - [Benny] Get your knife! - Guess I haven't lost my touch. - [Cohort] Better than cats, huh, Banjo? - Shut up, you dummy! I gotta explain this. - But Boss-- - Shut up! Let's get outta here. (suspenseful music) - Pete... - Don't talk, I gotta get some help. - [Joe] Listen, Pete. - Joe, I gotta get you some help. - You gotta finish because I'm not gonna be able. - How can I finish without you? - You can with the Lord's help. Ask Him. - Stop that talk. You're gonna be okay. I'm gonna get some help. - Promise. - Joe, don't talk like that. - Promise. - I promise. - I gotta go home now, Pete. - No! You just hold on. Joe? Hey, come on, Joe. Don't. Don't die. (bell ringing) (solemn music) (sobbing) Joe. Joe. Come on, Joe. (police sirens wailing) (suspicious music) - Let me talk to the man. Yeah, it's important! Gonna be a problem tonight. I'll call you later. - We got another problem, Boss. - [Benny] What? - Another kid. - Go keep your eye on him, Banjo. (suspenseful music) (someone whistling "I Will Serve Thee") (window slamming) - [Jake] Joe. - [Police Radio] Ambulance calling-- - [Jake] Joe? - [Police Radio] Go ahead, four two four. - [Jake] Joe. That's my Joe. Joe. Joe! No, no. No. No, no. No. No, no. No, no. Joey (sobbing). No, Joey. No. No. No. - [Police Radio] Two one 12, repeat. (radio voice mumbling due to static) Two one five, get on the phones, any available. I know it's a two one five-- (radio voices overlapping) (radio voice mumbling due to static) (solemn music) (Celia crying) (Anne Marie gasping) (door slamming) (car engines revving) (whistle tweeting) (whistle tweeting) (whistle tweeting) - Pete. (strange glissando) All right, all right, let's go. - [Connors] Pete. (door slamming) - [Pete's Mom] Pete, honey? (door slamming) - [Pete's Mom] I wanna talk to you, Pete. - I'm busy, Mom. - No Pete, you're not. You're not at basketball practice either. - I didn't feel like it. - You miss Joe. Honey, it's natural to grieve for your friend, but you can't punish everyone else for what happened. - I'm not! - Pete, you don't know anything about Joe's death, do you? - [Pete] No! - Pete, if you do, you've got to tell the police. - No! I mean, I don't know anything, nothing, honest. - [Pete's Mom] Son. - Leave me alone, Mom. Leave me alone. - Pete. - I don't know anything. (dramatic music) - [Connors] Hi Pete. - [Pete] Oh, hi, Pastor Connors. - How about giving me a hand with this? - [Pete] I'd like to, but... Yeah, let's take this way, it's shorter. - We missed you and your help, Pete. - I just don't, since... - I understand, you miss Joe. We all do. - Yeah. Joe believed your God was protecting him, and Joe's dead. - Joe trusted the Lord. - Yeah, right into his grave. That's some kind of loving God, that kills off His believers. - Pete! - Don't start handing me anymore jazz, Pastor. Joe was my friend, and Joe's dead. Your God let it happen. - [Bobby] Oh Pete (panting)! - Bobby! (Bobby coughing) - It's paint. It's only pink paint. - Bobby, what happened? - A man. - [Pete] What man? - He threw paint all over me. - What man? - [Bobby] A man with a knife. - A knife? - Banjo! (Bobby panting) - [Pete] Did he say anything? - He said to tell you. - What? - He said you'd get the message. (Bobby coughing and crying) - Pete. - Go on into the apartment, Bobby. Start washing yourself off. Go on. - It's you they're after. - Thanks to you. - What do you mean? - Joe died because of you and your habit. - That's not true! - He was trying to get the guy that got you on the stuff. Only they got him. - You were there. You know who did it! - So do you. - No, I-- - [Pete] They're your friends, not mine. He died for you. The next time you shoot up, try remembering that. He died for you! - You know I love you Pete, don't you? - Sure, Mom. - You know what's right and what's wrong, don't you? - I think so. - Is not telling the police right? - Yeah. I've gotta think of you and the kids. - You think doing a wrong is gonna help us? - It'll keep you alive. - I'll tell you something, son. Joe was a boy who died a man. You can be proud of your friend. - My dead friend. - Yes, he's with the Lord now. Joe had something I thought you had. - Aw, Mom. - When you put your trust in the Lord, you are not afraid to fight the good fight. - And die a good death? - A lot worse can happen to you than dying. A lot worse. Pete. When you run away from what the Lord wants, you die inside. Not like Joe, but slow and painful. - Mom! - Celia Corelli and I are both grieving for our sons. - [Pete] Anne Marie. Anne Marie. - Pete? - [Pete] Come out on the roof. I gotta talk to you. (crickets chirping) I'm sorry I talked to you like that this afternoon. - It was true. - Yeah, but Joe loved you, and I had no right to say those things. - I really love my brother, Pete. He didn't know it. - Sure he did. - You think so? - [Pete] Yeah. Joe asked me to finish the job, and I ran away. - Joe would understand. - [Pete] No. I've gotta finish the job. - It doesn't matter. I'm... I'm going where I won't bother anybody anymore. (sniffs) Dad stopped drinking, on account of Joe's dying. He straightening up, so Mom's better off. I thought if I were gone-- - That's not what Joe died for! - I caused all the trouble, so I should pay! - Terrific, then they can grieve over both their kids. - (sobbing) What can I do? - Well, we've both gotta stop running. - Where do we start? - Where Joe did. Are you willing to tell your story to the police, Pete? Joe was. (suspenseful music) - [Pete] I guess so. - [Connors] That's where we'll start, with the police. - I want in on it. Promise, Pete? - Promise. - I'll stick around until it's finished. - Where will you go after? - Away. - [Connors] Anne Marie! - (sobbing) What? - There's someone who loves you, even more than Joe, if you let Him. You can be proud, Pete. - I'm too scared to be anything. - Be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. - Pastor Connors, Pastor Connors! Pastor Connors, been all over looking for you. My grandma is dying and she needs you. - I understand. - [Man] You gotta hurry, Pastor. She ain't got too long. - I'll come soon. - I won't be going anywhere. (sorrowful music) - [Anne Marie] (sobbing) I said I was sorry, Joe. It's too late. I'm sorry for my whole life. Help me, Jesus. I'm so messed up. Joe said You'd love me anyway. Okay. I give myself to You. (sobbing) Help me. (emotional music) (water splashing) (Anne Marie crying) Help me. (suspenseful music) (knife thuds) (punch thudding) (dog barking) (swings clanking) - Hurry up! - [Connors] Where? - [Youth] There. (board thudding) (suspenseful drumroll music) - (laughing) Happy prayers, Preacher! (Pete knocking and rattling door) - Now, Lord! - [Benny] Get him! Come on, get that coward! (stairs rattling) (Benny grunting) (suspenseful music) - What now, Boss? - Let's get outta here. - You're right, Mom. We can't go on like this. The Lord is going to get tired of rescuing me all the time. - I'll take care of the kid on my own. - You'll do nothing! We scared him good and I don't want any fuzz around tomorrow night. - You gonna go through with that? - The man don't know nothing and he ain't gonna know. We need that stuff or we're dead on the street. - I been hawking up to my eyebrows. - We'll make the pickup, then we'll ice the kid. But not till after tomorrow night! You got that, Banjo? - Okay, okay. - [Benny] He'll be too scared to move. (Pete sighing) (person knocking on door) - Who is it? - Lee Connors. - Hey, you fought hard for that soul. - You okay? - It was a setup. - Yeah. - I got a suggestion. - [Connors] What? - Let's call it in. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah. (comedic tune) - So I promised Joe to finish it. - Count me in, Joe led me to the Lord. - Me too. I didn't know you were a Christian, Lenny. - Well, I thought all you guys would make fun of me. - I thought the same thing. Joe helped me become a Christian too. - You're kidding! - He was picking us all out for Jesus. None of the rest of us knew it. - I'll bet old Joe is laughing his head off now. - [Boys] Yeah. - Yeah. Okay, see you tonight. - Hey Pete. Shouldn't we pray about this? - Yeah, guess so. - That's would Joe would do. - You lead, Pete. - Me? But, I can't-- - Go on, Pete. - (sighing) Lord, you know Joe and what he was trying to do. Help us finish the job. Amen. - [All] Amen. (gentle guitar music) - [Pete Voiceover] You must think I'm a real dummy. I pretended I didn't know You, ran away from what You wanted me to do. Anyone else would tell me to bug off. But Joe said You'd forgive me. So I'm asking. I'm gonna meet the guys in a minute. If what happened to Joe happens to me, well, I'll know You wanted me home sooner than I planned. Take care of Mom and the kids, please? And take care of Anne Marie for Joe.
