Conor? Conor? Esther? Ruthie? Esther? I've been marked next. Don't. She's right behind you. Do you realize that we haven't seen a car in about 35 minutes? Yeah. We're like in the middle of nowhere. Dave, you act like you've never left Manhattan. Well, it feels like I haven't. I wanna make sure that we get interviews out here. Copy. I love this lake, and this dabbling sort of light. Jumping in the lake, I'm so in. Anyone bring bathing suits? Who needs a bathing suit? Alright, here we go. Will, can you get a shot of that? Copy. You good? Day one is underway, as we enter Holmes County, Ohio, home to the largest population of Amish in the Unites States. Guys, look over there. Oh, that's a real horse and buggy. Oh yeah. Hey, put that camera away. What if they see us filming? Windows are tinted, my friend. We have been given permission to document the lives of a few Amish women to explore what it is to be female in the Amish world today. And through them, we will have unprecedented access to the most reclusive sect of Amish. I need to change batteries before we land. Ooo, this is beautiful out here. Yeah, but I don't have any service. Switch your phone to airplane mode, so your battery doesn't drain. You're not gonna get service up here. The English invasion has arrived. Oh Do you guys get a B-roll? Copy that, this place could shoot itself. Hey, Conor, is that him? Oh yeah. That should be Isaac, our contact. Here we go. I thought Conor was a man. Oh, but we talked on the phone. I thought you were his secretary. Okay, is it gonna be a problem? No, no, pardon the confusion. Yeah, we're good to go here. Alright, everyone just please remember, photography is strictly prohibited alright, so cameras must be hidden in public, and can only be displayed in the private home with the permission of the owner. Now, the reason I stress this is the Bishop has not sanctioned photography for this, alright. He thinks you're here researching a book for Amish life. So, cameras must be hidden, or I risk being shunned. Got it? So, is everyone in Holmes County, Swartzentruber? No, no, there's at least 13 different sects of Amish in Holmes County, all with varying degrees of strictness. Swartzentruber is the most strict. You have no running water in our homes, outhouses out back, and you can't even heat water with propane. Then how did you get us access to these girls? They agreed to it. See, we believe that it's God's will for the truth to be told about us to disprove English myths about our lives. Anyway, they're only at risk when you're here. You know, none of the families have electricity, much less television, so whatever you do with what you get done, we'll be the wiser when you're gone. Alright, great. Oh, also you'll need to cover those. To the Amish, tattoos are the marks of the beast. AJ, I've been getting some sick B-roll all day. Cool. What's B-roll? They're inserts, it's like, beauty shots. Shots of the environment that we can cut into. What's that? I believe you call em' scare crows. I've never seen a scare crow without a face. Hey, AJ, you wanna get a closer look at that? No, I'm sorry, I can't allow that. That house, it belongs to Rebecca Swartzentruber, she's the community's bruja. To the Amish, bruja means witch. An Amish witch? Yes, but she's been shunned by the community, so you're not allowed to speak to her, or even look her direction. Okay. You good? Yeah, I'm good. Good? Yep. Okay, let's go meet the girls. Oh, that's gonna have to be done by a woman. Sorry about that. I got it, no prob. Thank you. What do you need from me? If you actually can find that tiny little lipstick camera. I think we put it up there. That would be great, thank you. Okay, I'm gonna put this down your dress, okay. Okay. It's a microphone. I'm gonna tape it on the inside of your dress. - Okay. - Alright. It's gonna tickle a little. Okay, alright, great. That wasn't too bad. I did it. Why are your ears covered? - Oh these? - Yeah. Oh, these are headphones, so I can hear you. Say something. Like what? I don't know, I, what? Perfect. What did I do perfect? We're good to go here. You're perfect. Stop making fun of me. No. You ever see one of these before? That's how the beast is let in. Why do the English wanna know about us? Because you're interesting. Don't you think you're interesting? No. The English think we're strange. They stare at us when we go to town. That's because you're interesting. Can you hear me? Yep, Esther, I can hear you. Hey, how are you guys doing in here? Good. Let's start, yeah? Ruthie, come on in. You okay? Mmmhmm. Alright, one of you two ladies sit here. Okay? Great. Hey Conor, could you move back just a little bit? - Oh. - Thank you. Are you good to go? Yeah, we're good, we're rollin', yeah. And we're just gonna start really easy, okay? Have you ever been friendly with an English? Oh yes, I've been friendly with a few of them in the market... Hush! You might have met some of them, but you've never been friends. Is everything okay? Ruthie, are you okay? MmmHmm. Okay. How many days of the week are you at the market? Whenever we need to. Do you go there to sell or... That came from Grandmother's! Okay, okay, Ruthie! No, no, you stay here! What if they need help? It's none of your concern. Rebecca, the bruja, it's the girl's grandmother? Yes, it's the death bell. Rebecca Swartzentruber has passed. I'm so sorry for your loss yesterday. Rebecca was old, so it wasn't surprising. It was God's will that he claimed her. What brought you here? I came to be her apprentice. Apprentice for what? Bruja. What does a bruja do? We're healers, caregivers. We are skilled in natural medicine, so we use herbs, spices, and oils in our practice, but because the Amish don't understand it, they call our work witchcraft. Aren't you afraid of being shunned? I am shunned. My gifts are strong, God works through me, and I'm willing to sacrifice for it. For me, there is nothing else. I have this gift, and I feel the need to help. How can you help if you're shunned? They came to Rebecca and I in the shadows of the night. They only ignore us in daylight. What would you rather them do? Acknowledge us. I'm not the only bruja here. What are you makin' over there? I am making my famous apple tarts. Esther comes from a long bloodline of very gifted bruja. I usually sell them at the market, but it's just for us and the crew, of course. Her grandmother being one of the most powerful. Esther herself is strong, and she practices in private because she's afraid of being shunned. Does her cousin practice also? Ruthie? No, she a good Swartzie. Who's that girl? I don't know, I've never even seen her. I pray the Bishop gives Rebecca a proper funeral. I thought she was a descendant of the founding family. Blood means nothing when you're shunned. Who is this? Katie Ann. How'd it go with Conor? Fine. Katie Ann... - Gingrich. - Gingrich. She's a cousin of ours. She's come to help with Grandma's preparations, Iva. It is God's will that we have help today. We need it. Your grandmother never mentioned you. Iva. That's unfortunate to hear. Or curious. Do you always introduce yourself with an insult? Child, it's a simple fact. Mind your temper, tantrums spawn from vanity. Enough! We have to work to do. Come on. Let's try to get a release from her. Katie Ann, just be natural. Cameras aren't strange to me. I have some English friends. I've even been photoed before, lots. Can we work in peace? Katie Ann, this is a somber moment. It's the Bishop. The English can't be in here! Please, hide your cameras! You and your brethren can not be found by him? It's not easy being here at this time. I do understand your time of mourning, but the elders have spoken. And it will be a black funeral. She was shunned, that is our way in the matter. She will be buried on unconsecrated ground outside of the community cemetery. And she must wear black. Without a proper burial, her soul will not be put to rest. Please, there must be a way. It has been decided. This is wrong. She's deserves respect for everything she's done for this community. Her soul won't rise if she is desecrated in this way. We can't go against the Bishop. Yes we can. We can bury her in white, and no one will know otherwise! God will know! And God will welcome her to heaven. Esther, don't listen to her. Don't listen to her, she's shunned, she has nothing to lose, and she is going to bring trouble to this. Look at me, look at me. If you do this, think of your future. If you do this and the Church finds out, you're gonna be shunned. Esther... We could all be shunned. Esther, look at me please, do not condemn your grandmother to hell. Iva, Iva please, this is a family matter. A family matter, Katie Ann, and where have you been in the past year where I took care of her? Esther, don't listen to her. Don't listen to her, you know the right thing to do. It's not easy, but it's the right thing. Esther. We have to do what the Bishop wants. No Iva, please wait, please, Iva. Esther, stop, don't. It's alright Esther, it's the right thing. Are you Esther Swartzentruber? Yes. I'm Salom Arodijpare. I'm sorry to hear about your grandmother. I wanted to help in any manner possible. That's very kind, God bless you. I'm here to offer condolences on behalf of a small group of bruja in Indiana. We offer you our support, such a brave young group of bruja. You are mistaken, we are not bruja. The only bruja in this house is dead in that box. The energy here says otherwise. There is a powerful presence in this room. Whatever presence you may feel came with you, and it should leave with you. Do not poison our home with your impure practices. I will return for the burial. Good day. Come, we must wash our hands. Go, go, go, get back there. Get right back there. No one's there. Probably just one of the local boys playing a joke on us. Yeah, so when's the funeral? It's in three days. It's customary for the deceased to be remained attended to during that time for people to come and go and pay their respects. Are your parents gonna help you? Oh no, they're dead, Ruthie's and mine. Oh, I'm so sorry. It was a barn fire at my uncle's while we were having church. We were lucky, me and Ruthie, we weren't there. My grandmother raised us. I used to love listening to her tell stories. What kind of stories would she tell you? Oh, stories kids liked. Scary ones. Mostly about two little girls who get lost in the woods, but she would always end the story by saying, "Don't worry angel, Grandmother will always find you." Esther, there's someone outside again. Why are you still dressed? Someone pounded on my window! Ruthie, I don't see anyone. There was someone, I'm telling you, there was someone pounding on my window. You see! Esther you heard that earlier, and now this? Careful, Esther be careful. Hello. There's no one there. What in the world? Hello! Do you see anything? No. I'm sure it's the Swartzie boys just tryin' to give us a scare. Hey, it's been a long day, you should go to bed. I can sit up with Grandmother tonight, it's okay. Thank you. Yes. Come in then. It's okay, shh, shh, shh. There you go. There you are. That's a good boy. There you go, back to your mama. Shh, shh, shh. What was that? Kindness. Now go to bed. What about the crew? Is it possible that someone from your group was trying to scare her? Absolutely not, we wouldn't do that. Why was there a camera left inside? That was left over from the interview yesterday. We're not here to manipulate events, Esther. I promise, okay, you have my word. Okay. How many do you think we should get? Maybe two of each. How well do you know Iva? A lot better than we know you. Oh, we, a year, at least. Why do you ask? Just curious. I had trouble sleeping with her moving about all last night in Grandmother's place. I couldn't figure out what she was doing. Oh that was just restlessness, I'm sure. No, no, no, no. It sounded like she was moving things, heavy things. Do you think she has intentions of taking over Grandmother's place? Do you? I think that's too soon to make any assumptions. I had higher hopes for our settlement. I knew no one would come. This is an unconsecrated burial. That's enough to keep anyone away. They should all be ashamed of themselves. God doesn't see witchcraft as righteously as you do. We should bury her, and then wait back at the house. I think people would be more comfortable paying respects in a more suitable location. No, the Bishop isn't here yet. He's always present at burials, even on consecrated ones. The Bishop's not coming. Ruthie, it's been over an hour now, you gotta be sensible. I'll perform the rights. Thank you. Oh, Esther, Esther. Look at the face. I bet it was the work of that bruja from Indiana. We need to go back to the house. Don't look at it, we need to go back to the house. What? Oh my goodness! Who did this? Awe, look. Awe, no! Ruthie! What was that? Well, go, go! How long has she been up here for? I think they're trying to send us a message. Who? The community. What I'm actually most curious about, on the wall in the bedroom? The hex on Ruthie's wall is a dark sign. It's dark work, and it's something that we recognize from Grandmother's place. What does dark work mean? Do we have to talk about it? No, but I do want you to feel like this is safe space. Like this is a safe space? Like this is a safe space? I don't feel safe. Why don't Amish dolls have faces? Well, it's so the devil can't look at us through the eyes of grave images. If there's no face in somethin', he has no way of watchin' us. The bruja from Indiana, she's dead! Conor, come, come! What? Iva, wait! Iva! Where is she? She was here, she was right there in that tree. You're sure? Yes, I am positive. - Conor! - Where is she? Who? The woman from Indiana. You saw her too? - Yeah. - Yeah. We got it on video, but the cameras died. Just playback. How long has she been here for? Should we report it? No one's got service. I should tell the Bishop. No, it will only make the sentiment more suspicious of us. And besides, none of us even knew who she actually was. I know what I saw, Ruthie! I know, Iva, I know, but no one should go to the Bishop until we find a body. He will think that we invited this evil upon us. We got it on camera! But that's why we shouldn't. It proves it's, Esther! It proves it's on the English's device, the Bishop will know that we've gone against his rule! What the hell happened? Like I said, the bruja from Indian was hanging from that tree. And she was dead? Yeah. Well, technically, we don't know if she was dead. Iva said she was cold, we didn't take a pulse. We don't know if she was dead. I know what I saw, that woman was definitely dead. No, that's speculation. You don't know that for a fact. We don't know if she was dead. So, it could've been a set up. Yeah. I don't doubt you saw what you did, we have it on tape. But there are ways to fabricate a hanging, theater tricks. I think there's still a good chance someone may be trying to mess with you girls. I think we keep looking, if we find a body then we'll report it, if not, let's not draw more attention to you, okay. How well do you know Katie Ann? Not very well. Her mother, our aunt, she left the settlement when I was an infant. This is the first time I've really met her. They were rarely discussed. Her mother married a new order man... Left for a new life and never looked back. I see darkness in her eyes. Everything was fine until she got here. There's something not right about her. At your grandmother's house I hear her banging around at all hours of the night. She accused you of the same. What? Me? What business would I... When did you hear her? The past couple nights. If it wasn't me or Katie Ann... Somebody has been moving in that house at night. Yes. Please, my husband is very ill. Of course, please come in. There is no bruja in this house! You need to find help elsewhere, and be sure to let others know! There is no practicing in this house! Go away! Yes ma'am. You didn't have to be rude to her. Of course I did! You know the ungodly things that we witnessed in Grandmother's house as children! I want the truth known! There is no bruja in this house. Grandmother is dead. They have nowhere else to go. It's natural that they want to come here. Not in my house! Be smart Esther, the settlements already talkin', and if you don't stop, they're gonna turn their back on you just like they did Grandmother. And you're gonna lose everything, not just Isaac, but me too. Ruthie. Esther. Iva, I, I need to be alone right now. Okay. Oh my God, did you see that? Did you get that? - Yeah, I saw that. - What? What? Come on, come on. Open the door! Oh jeez. What'd you guys see? Dave. Dave, what did you see? I don't know, it was fast man, I don't know. It was like an old lady running through the woods, with no clothes on or somethin', man. What? I could be wrong man, I don't know. Hello! Is anybody out there? Look, it was fast! Come on, come on! Wait! What the heck is that? Oh, what is that thing? You guys get inside. Get back in! What is it doing? What the hell? Who put that there? It's not funny. What was that? A dead bird. Conor, what was that? I don't... I don't know, everyone just take a breath. Who put the dead bird on the roof? I don't know about the dead bird, I don't know! It's okay. We're gonna die! We're totally gonna die here! We're not gonna die, AJ, take a breath! Conor, someone's playing tricks on us, and it's not funny! Yeah! I do think someone's playing tricks on us. You guys I don't think someone's trying to scare the girls, I think they're trying to scare us into leaving. But it's okay, okay guys, it's okay. We're gonna go. We can go... We're gonna go now! We can go tonight, we have to pack up, but we can go tonight. Things have been worse since you left. It's evil... Evil work. Late at night. I was just making supper and something pushed me... Oh my God. And I cut myself. Whatever pushed me, I didn't see, I... Katie Ann, you tell her. Well, I mean, I was sleep walking, and I came before Grandmother's grave. Something pulls me there. At night someone's moving furniture in Rebecca Swartzentruber's room, heavy pieces, and strange setups. Ruthie, tell them. Somethin' has been watching me sleep, and it whispers things. Bad things. Either someone is trying to drive us crazy... Or we've already set sail in that direction. Or your Grandmother is furious about her shameful burial. How do you want us to help? We need you to put your cameras in the house and see what is tormenting us. Just the small ones. Oh Esther, the last thing I wanna do is get you girls in more trouble. No one here will breath a word of it. So, we're seeing from top of the grid out here, to right about here, right. So, the two angles of this whole room. Yeah, it's great. And what other rooms do you wanna set up? We need one in each bedroom. Okay, I got plenty. And then make sure to cover the kitchen. That's great, thank you. Alright, good. Movin' on. Up this way. It's cold in here. Can't keep a fire in the fireplace, if something doesn't want the warmth. Something? Or she, I should say. I think Rebecca kept a dark energy under control, and now that's she's gone, my gifts aren't strong enough to harness it. This is her room. Why are the windows boarded up? When Rebecca grew ill, she rested much better in the dark. Is the furniture normally like this? No, it changes every night. It'll be different by morning. You'll have to put a camera in here. Come, I'll show you to where Katie Ann and I sleep. You'll wanna cover your ears. - What? - Oh my God. Since her death, that happens every time someone moves her room. This way. How can it see us in the dark? When there's no light, it goes into night mode. So, where's Katie Ann's room? Oh, she sleeps right over here. Focus some more. It's still a little bit out of focus. That's better, good. AJ, you good? This place is really weird. Yes it is. Sorry guys... It was just me. See you in the morning. Are you guys gonna be okay? It usually comes at night, so ah... Now we wait. We can't live feed? No, we didn't bring enough equipment, so we'll just have to check in the morning. Okay. Do you guys believe them? We'll see what we get. The imagination can be a tricky thing. In any case, those girls were legitimately freaked out. Cameras loaded, I'm gonna head back in there, and see if I can capture what's been messing with the girls. Okay. B-cams still on! So weird. Esther? Did you hear that? Yeah. What was that? Ruthie? What's goin' on? What? Where have you been? I... Answer me! Your room was just empty, Ruthie! What are you still doin' up? Why would you do that? Why would you plant that thing right outside our door? Why would I do what? Why would you do that? Esther, do what? Calm yourself. What is it? Did you see who moved it last night? No, we only put cameras inside, not outdoors. Do you know when Ruthie left the house last night? No, she purposely moved the camera in her room to hide her window. Esther, is Katie Ann here? No. What happened? It happened last night. The scarecrow caught fire. Someone just moved it here? That's all we know. If Katie Ann's not here, she's gone, and there's more. Please, you have to come to Grandmother's. Ruthie? Ruthie, get out here! Katie Ann's missin'. Hurry, please. She missin'? Please. I woke up this morning expecting to hear Katie Ann in the kitchen. She's an early riser, but she wasn't there so I went back into the room to see if she was in bed... And you just have to see. Don't touch it! It's dark work. She's gone, I've looked everywhere for her. Maybe she went home. Without sayin' bye, no, she didn't go home. What does this mean? It's what left in the resting place of a bruja when she's been burned. Guys, I found something. What were you doing? I have no memory of that, I promise. I did not do that on my own will. AJ, could you play the other one? She stands like that for an hour. Stop here. Wait, what? Look at the time. Three seconds are missing. Someone must have turned the camera off briefly, that's the only explanation. Well, let's check the other cameras, and see where she went after she left the room. I can't find her on any other feed after she leaves the bedroom. People don't just disappear. You know... She uses our family name, but we never met here, not face to face. What are you getting at? If there's someone trying to scare us, why not have the help of a stranger who's falsely usin' our family name? That's an awfully complicated plot for a scare. But nothin' strange happened until she arrived. Ruthie, we're not victims of jest. There's darkness at work, I know you can feel it. We all can. Your grandmother is filled with fury. It's our fault. We have to go back, and lay her to rest properly. We have to fix what we have done. You mean go and dig her up? A buried woman? It's blasphemy, I will not stand for that! Ruthie do you have any better ideas? Where have you been going all hours of the night? What? Is that true? Is what true? Esther? Ruthie? The Bishop is on his way. He knows the English have returned, alright. They need to go! Go! Hide. Stay here, stay. Certain things have been brought to my attention. You deliberately disobeyed my wishes of no English photography. And you let Satan into our community. And for this, I am officially placing you under bond. Your shunning will be in three days. Prepare your confession to plead your case now. Bishop, I only asked for help here... There is also talk of you practicing. The church is no place for a bruja. I had high hopes for you Esther. Isaac... You are to remain on the farm until her hearing... To prevent the practice of bruja. How could you do it? Isaac. Isaac. I'll be outside. Esther. Esther, Esther, it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Esther, Esther, I thought it would only be a reprimand. I'm so sorry. You told him? Esther. Esther, Esther, Esther, I am... That is where you've been going at night? I'd never... That is where you've been going at night, Ruthie? You've been tempted by a dark power. I promise you I would never have done anything like this if I thought that was what would come of it, I promise. Ruthie, if my future is filled with emptiness, it will all be on your hands. Believe me, I never thought this would happen. Esther, I talked to him, I was only trying to protect you. Get out of my sight! I was trying to protect you! Esther, Esther please... Get out of here! Please forgive me. You stop with that nonsense, Ruthie, get out! Get out! I wanted to help you. Please forgive me. There's only one way that you can redeem yourself. I will do anything. Tonight... We're digging up Grandmother, and we are making this right. What about Isaac? I'll handle Isaac. Iva... Do you have any idea what you've done? Iva, Iva, Iva. Don't! Oh God, please help me. Okay, everyone. Let's begin. Ruthie. Ruthie. Do it! Isaac, stop! Ruthie. Take it. I can't do it, I can't. Esther, I can't do it, I can't do it. Ruthie, look at me. You are gonna go, and you are gonna go to Grandmother's, get her white burial dress and her bible, and bring it back to me. Can you at least do that for me? Go! Ruthie. You're gonna be okay. You're doing the right thing. You're doing the right thing. What's takin' her? She probably can't find where I put the dress. I'll go help. Thank you. She... She was there. Isaac, we put her in there ourselves. Someone have desecrated her grave. We got it on camera, didn't we? No, I have to tell the Bishop alright... No, Isaac, no... This is now a spiritual concern! Just go back and wait at your house. We should not be here. This is the devil's work. What about Ruthie and Iva? I'll go tell them, alright, now just go! Go! Ruthie! Ruthie! Hurry up. Ruthie. Iva, Ruthie? Iva, Ruthie! Someone desecrated Rebecca's bible. She's not in the grave, alright. Her body is missing. What? We buried her ourselves. No, you girls need to go wait at Esther and Ruthie's house, alright. I'm gonna go get the Bishop, alright. Go, Go! Okay. Ruthie! Ruthie! We have to leave, please, Ruthie! Ruthie, are you in here? Please! Ah! They should be here by now, right? I'm gonna go outside and wait for them, okay? You can come and get me if you need anything, alright? - Yeah. - Okay. Where the hell is the RV? It's not here, I don't know what's going on. I tried... Okay, okay, I want it to be up there waiting for me when the girls get here. I want to put them in there. Will you go up there and wait for me, please? You're not listening! The RV and the production van are dead! How? I don't know, they have plenty of gas, they won't turn over and I've checked everything... Okay, okay! Let's at least get those girls out of that house. Okay. Hey, you stay here, keep an eye out. Okay. Ugh. Hello? Someone there? Conor? Ruthie? Iva? Katie Ann? Where have you been? Answer me. Answer me! Esther? Ruthie? Esther? I've been marked next. Don't move. She's right behind you. Be advised, we have one deceased in the residence. - Hey. - Hi. Hi. Oh my God, look at you. You look great. Thank You. Right here? Yeah. Thanks for coming down and meeting me. Yeah. Do you miss Amish life? Life now it... It's okay. It's fast. It's lonely. How's Ruthie? She's happily married to the Bishop. Bishops's wife, it's a big deal, so... I assume she's happy. Being shunned we cannot talk. And Isaac? I wouldn't know. He's chosen the church over me. I'm sorry. He's Amish, he always will be. What was it that you wanted to tell me? Yeah... What happened to Grandmother... We were told that the elders had dug her up shortly after we buried her. They burned her body to protect themselves. But what they did for protection isn't gonna ever give them any. She will never be at peace now, so there will never be peace in Holmes County. That's why I left. I need to show you something. What is this? How is this possible? I checked, it's legitimate. She died in a car crash a couple years ago. There's something else. Iva? What? We buried her. When were these takin'? Two days ago. How is this possible? Conor, how is this possible? If the bruja came in as Katie Ann, maybe she left as Iva. Their stories... You remember? Their stories will always end the same way. "Don't worry angel, Grandmother will always find you."
