subtitle edited by - Aorion - "Chappie" color font ^ (video time 002:00:19) Man 1: Historically, when we look at evolution, it's not surprising that uh... Chappie's left turn uh.. happened. Man 2: It's too early to tell how this is all going to play out. I didn't believe this would happen in my lifetime, but it is happening. Woman 1: Downtown Johannesburg. Man 1: It's a dangerous city. Man 2: Each day, more than 300 murders and violent attacks take place here. Woman 2: 2 officers have been killed, 3 other have been taken to the hospital. Woman 3: A bloody end to a shoot-out between cops and robbers. Another man in blue dead. Today, we usher in a new day. One that represents the end of crime. Man: Move in. Lock on target. Fire! Fire! Police chief: The end of corruption. Man: Go! Go! Up against the wall! Scout 1: On the ground. All targets neutralized. Police chief: And the start of the rebirth of our city! [Whistles and applause] Welcome to the world's first robotic police force. Johannesburg, South Africa, became the focus of the world in 2016 with the deployment of the planet's first all-robotic police units. Crime levels plummeted, and Tetravaal stock skyrocketed. Certain parts are brought in from China, but all robots are assembled right here in South Africa. The biggest fear the population express, was vulnerability to hacking. Tetravaal assures this is not something to worry about with their bulletproof guard key system. A system which allows them, and only them to update software on the robots. Before the success of the ubiquitous human-sized police robots, there was a bigger bad boy on the block: The moose. Vincent Moore is a weapons designer and a former soldier. He has a fundamental spiritual issue with artificial intelligence. I have a robot that is indestructible. It is operated by a thinking, adaptable, humane, moral human being. Cooper: The hypervalence neurotransmitter converts the human operator's thoughts into the robot's actions. A parture from the artificial Intelligence that governs the scouts. Now with interest from the U.S., China and north Korea. The scouts' creator, Deon Wilson, sees a rich future. What really interests me is high-level AI. True intelligence. A machine that can think and feel. Interviewer: Is that the mandate at Tetravaal? To take that evolutionary step forward and build something truly alive? Uh... [Over pa]: Scout 22 arriving now at maintenance bay 6. Man 1: Team 1, off deck. Man 2: Hurry. Open it up. Woman: Get him out. Man 1: Load it up! Load it up! Man 2: Got it? He's pretty banged up. Man 3: We just examined the scout. Man 4: Let's go, let's go! Man 1: Come on. Ready to go. Oh... Christ's sakes See this 22 uh? Luck of the draw. They used him as a speed bump. Look at this. It's like he's cursed or something. Every time he goes out. Now, yeah, it's his ear. Antenna, right. Can we switch this out? Woman 1: Check that circuit again. Man: Terminal on 7 and 7a. Woman 1: Now, go start with zero, zero. [Over pa]: Reports of gunfire in sections 5, 7 and 8. Okay, fire it up. Police request all available scouts to be mobilized immediately. Destination or task? Helipad. Yup. Hey, 22. Just watch yourself this time, eh. Affirmative. - Amerika : Hey! This ain't good, man! We're in shit! - Yo-Landi : Duh. We in shit, Amerika! Pitbull: I said it was a bad deal. -Pitbull: I said it over and over. - Ninja: Everybody, just chill! Just... Yes, we have a problem. And, yes, I'm gonna solve it! Pilot: Command, we are searching for suspects driving a gray vehicle. Ahh...! Man: Hey... They're here... - What's up with this shit? - He looks pissed. Hippo. Listen, some shit went down. Wasn't our fault. Your weapon. Ah... Fuck's sakes. And your keys. Man: Come on. Hippo: Open the back. Oh...! Hey, hey, hey...! Yo, yo, yo, yo... [Whistles] We're lucky to be alive, Hippo. Hippo: Ninja. You know there's no way out of this. There's always a way. Please be calm. Just name your price. We'll sort you out. My price? Is 20 million. - Oh, come on man. That's ridiculous. - What... - ... the fuck? - Jesus Christ. Fuck. How am I gonna pay that back, dude? Ah man. Get on your knees. - Hippo: Now, get on your fucking knees! - Okay, okay, okay. You owe me... 20 million. Say it. [Muffled] I owe you... - Pitbull. Pitbull! - Man 1: Get back! Get back! Get back!... Jesus Christ, Hippo. Hippo: Seven days! You got seven days. Man 2: Droids! Droids! Ah man. You were followed! Man 3: Get behind the wall! - Yo-Landi, get in the van, get in the van. - Shit. Yo-Landi: Let's go! Ninja: Get in! Man 4: Hit the explosives! Pilot: They detonated some kind of explosive. Man 5: Shit! Droids! We can't get a clear shot. Touching down. Scout 22: Moving out. Ninja: Who took the keys? Yo-Landi: You gave it to that guy! Pilot: Human officers are on the ground. Let's go! Move! Move out! Move out, 22. Go, go, go! Scout 22: Drop your weapons. You are under arrest. [Gunfire] Break right! Go, go, go! Come on... Where are the keys? Cue, on my left! Man: Kill these cops! Move! Back! Back! Yes, yes. Drop your weapons. Go! Hey, poes! I need my keys, please! Ninja: Fuck you! - Officer: Drop your weapon. - Fuck you. Officer: Drop your weapon! - Fuck... [Grunts] Fuck! Come on. Sure... baas. [Scanner beeping] Shit! He hit the rotor. We need to touch down. Ninja: Thank you very much. "22... Going in." [Grunts] [Powering down] - SCOUT #0022 OFFLINE - Tech: Droid 22 is down, sir. Bravo 1! We need backup! Dispatcher: Copy that. We're sending droids to your position. Ah! Amerika! Amerika! - I've got the keys! - The keys. - Hey, Landi, he's got the keys! - Let's go. Come on. Scout: Get out of the vehicle. Yo-Landi: Go! Yo-Landi: Let's go! Do not run. Ah... - Are you okay? - I'm not okay! I'm hit! Man: Scout 22 is non-responsive. Send an evac team. TV reporter: This is yet another victory for the robotic police force. This marks the 30th large-scale crime ring smashed this year. - Woman: Good morning, Deon. - Deon: Morning. [Bell dings] Michelle: People. if I may have your attention, please. The police chief just called me to place an order for another 100 scouts. This is very, very good news. Man 1: Way to go! Man 2: Deon. Man 3: Nice job! - Man 4: Well done, dude. Well done. - Man 5 : Way to go! Man 5: Congrats, D. Thank you, man. Man 6: Well done, Deon. Woman: Great. Woman 2: Congratulations. Thanks. Thank you. Woman 3: Good job. Nice job, buddy. I couldn't have done it without you. I know. Man 7: Congrats. You're awesome. Man 8: Nice job, mate! [Phone ringing] Is this the "I feel sorry for Vincent" phone call? - Don't worry, Vince. - Well, I am worried. Well, look, we have one more stab with the police tomorrow. Just keep trying to get those costs down. Try to think positive, okay? - Chin up. - Kind of hard to keep your chin up when you keep cutting my funding. 20 percent this year, 25 percent last year alright. I've got work to do on the Moose. You know I've got work to do. The threat detection is still in its... - ... elemental phase. - Threat detection is completely superfluous. The operator detects the threat. - Then we send the moose out. - Send... Send them... Enough already. Cut. Not add. - Okay? - Yeah. I'm on it. Woman [Over pa]: Deon Wilson to the workshop. Okay, I need to go. Yeah, okay. I'll talk to you in a bit, thank you. [Signal beeping] Think it's my little boy in again, eh? Looking surprise, surprise. Every time when he comes in. - He's a bullet magnet. - What's going on, guys? Here's the report. It's 22... again. RPG, direct to the chest. See a lot of the internals got damaged in the explosion. Yeah,but the brain architecture's still intact. Regardless, just write it off. Okay um..., let's salvage the cpu. We could try to cut the battery out. It's still fully charged, still stable. No, not worth the effort. Droid 22 written off. Crush the shanty and recycle the alloys. Yup. - Sure. - Thank you. Easy, easy, easy. Ninja: Come, come, come. Into the lair. - Amerika: Careful, man. - Yo-Landi: We need to stitch his shit up. [Yelling in foreign language] [Phone ringing] Yo. You think you got away! No, I didn't think that, Hippo. But, you think you don't owe me this money anymore huh? Because you think I'm in a prison or what? We'll get your money. Hippo. Maybe I come to your secret place in Soweto. I come there with the fellows. I take what I want. It's cool. One week. Seven days! - Ninja: They didn't catch that poes. - Yo-Landi: What? He knows where we live. He says we got a week to come up with his money. How are we gonna do that huh? Come on, that's ridiculous. We need one final job. I'm talking about serious cash. 500 million rand. Okay? We pay that animal. We pocket the rest. And we get out while we still can. Boom. Amerika: What are you getting on about, a bank job? No. - Ninja: Cash in transit. - Amerika: What? - Yo-Landi: That's what? - Ninja: A heist, Yo-Landi. If we do a heist. The droids are gonna come down on our asses, okay? - They're going to hit us harder. - It's true. Guys, we need.. Like a remote. - Like a switch. - What? Excuse me? Okay, the robots are like machines, right? Like a TV. So if we had a remote to switch it off... - That's brilliant. - Yo-Landi: We need to find the guy who makes the robots and steal his remotes. [Keys jingling] Dexter? Hello, Deon. Welcome home. Have you been a good boy today? Yes, Deon. Yeah? Did you clean my room? Your room has been sterilized. Nice. Are you working on your artificial intelligence program tonight? Yes. I will activate the kettle. Okay. Um... Hello again. Uh... So it's... day 944. I'm extremely close now. I mean there's always chance of error, And... I'm aware of this. But statistically speaking, I think I might be on track. I have several terabytes of compiling and coding to do and then... ... we shall see. All right. See you in a bit. [Hip hop music playing over speakers] Look. That's the motherfucker. Ninja: Him? Oh Dude, it's gonna be so easy. We need those remotes, my man. We need those remotes. Red bull! Yes, Deon. Red bull. Mm... Ahh... Okay. [Sighs] [Groans] Come on. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. What if you change the...? [Beeps] Oh! - It's stable. - Is everything okay? It's... It's stable. My god. I think I've cracked it. Of course, to really know, I must test it on a live system. I must test it. All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Whoa, whoa. Hey. Hey! - Hey. - How's it, sir? - Where's the scout? - What? The scout, man, 22 for demolition. Oh, the guys are prepping the compactor. It goes in soon. Oh, thank god. Um... - Don't destroy it yet, okay? - Yup, sure sure. - Just wait for me, but don't destroy it, okay? - Yup. - Hello, ma'am. - Mm-hm. Morning, Deon. All right. Let's have it. What are you proposing now? Ma'am, I think I've cracked it. The world's first proper, full artificial intelligence. This is a computer system that might be smarter than a human. I could show it a piece of art, and this thing, this being, could judge that art. It could decide if it liked it. It could write music and poetry. Okay. Stop. Please, Deon. Do you realize you just came to the CEO of a publicly-traded weapons corporation and pitched a robot that can write poems? Well, if you just let me explain-- Deon, Tetravaal is very happy with you. The scouts are a huge success. Ma'am, look, it won't cost you anything. There's a droid downstairs that was written off yesterday, smashed beyond repair. All I'm asking for is that you let me install this on it. - Please just let me test it. - No. No, I'm sorry, Deon. You know how insurance works for those, all the red tape and the paperwork. - Thank you for your time. - Mm-hm. Woman [Over pa]: All new employees, please report to human resources for orientation. Deon: Shit. Hey, Bill. Man [Over pa]: Attention. Attention. Remember to have your security pass visible at all times. Worker: Hey. Can you give me a hand over here? [Lock beeps] [Grunts] Come on. Come on. Come on. Thank you. Ninja: Yup. Showtime. - Amerika: What's up, homes? - Deon: Hey? Hey. Hey, hey, hey...! Please! Hey, what is it? This is you getting hijacked, my friend. Welcome to Joburg. And these are all part of what makes the Moose unique And I think perfect for you at the police department. The strategic ability to be able to neutralize the enemy's targets. High-value targets: Radar installations, aircraft, fuel storage locations. - Aircraft? - Yes, sir. [All chuckling] We're taking out an enemy's aircraft? We are talking about urban crimes here? You know, muggings, carjackings, loitering. I'm talking all kinds of targets, sir. Low to high. And I do believe you need a weapons platform that can fire high explosive warheads with precision and reliability. And might I add, sir, all under the control of a human operator. Look, Miss Bradley, The police force is very happy with the scouts. Very, very happy. - We just ordered new droids. - Thank you. And we've been very successful at bringing down the crime rate. But this? No, we don't want this. I mean, look at it. It's overkill. It's expensive, it's big, and it's ugly. It'll have to get a hell of a lot worse... ... for us to even consider this. A hell of a lot worse. No, I think we're done here. Michelle: Well, thank you, Commissioner Steenkamp. We'll get you those scouts. [Sighs] Ninja: Wakey, wakey. Please. Please, I don't have much money. Shut up. I don't want your money. - We know who you are, my friend. - We know you make the robots. No, there must be a mistake. I mean... [Grunts] Stop playing dumb with us! Yo. We know you clowns have some kind of TV remote thing to switch those robots off. Excuse me? It's a machine. It's got an on-off switch. - Maybe there's a remote in the Van. - Ja, check the Van. Amerika. - Amerika: Cut his feet off. - Ninja: That's a good idea. No, no, no! No, please! Help! Yo, man, that's a good idea. We'll cut your feet off. And you can just get yourself a nice, funky wheelchair. No, please, please. Just listen. You cannot switch them off. Bullshit! It's a machine. They are designed with a firmware lock. They're always on. - Yo-Landi: Just shoot him, man. - Deon: Please! Please, don't! No! Amerika: Yo! Y'all gotta see this. Ninja: Jesus Christ. He managed to turn this one off. There's legs and shit all over the place. Was he gonna build it or something? You know what? What if we get him to program this bad boy to fight for us? Like an indestructible robot gangsta. Number one, son. Hey. Listen, my friend, we know about your little buddy at... ... at the back of the van you're trying to hide from us. I wasn't hiding anything. Either you reprogram that robot in the Van to work for us... or we fucking shoot you right now. What do you mean exactly, "reprogram him"? - Yo-Landi: Don't play dumb! - Dude. You know exactly what we mean. You turn that robot into the illest gangsta on the block. We use him to make some moves and make some real money. The one in my van is a test. It's never been tried, but if it works, you can... You can train him to do what you want. I swear. What do you mean, "if it works"? It's a new project I'm working on. It makes the robot have a mind like a human. But it's like a child in the beginning. Like a human baby, but smarter. It's AI is capable of learning much faster than any organic intelligence. - But it would have to be taught. - Well, how long would that take? I said I don't know! It's untested. Alright, enough of this. Look! This is your only option! I created them and I'm telling you: You cannot switch them off and you cannot hack the other ones. Please, I don't wanna die. Okay. It's just plug and play. Quick release. Snap on and snap off. Why is all its legs off? It was scheduled for destruction. - Ninja: Why? - Because it's damaged. The battery is fused with the shanty. What? It means you can't change the battery. Why then, how long will it last? - Shit. - Ha-ha-ha. Oh, shit. Approximately five days, until the battery dies. And you say this thing will only run for five days? Roughly, yes. - Ninja: What is that? - Deon: It's a guard key. You need it to install new software on the droids. Ninja: Come on, man. Remember how I said it has to learn? I have to come back and help to teach it. Otherwise, this is pointless. Yo-Landi: Fine. Just switch it on. Switch the thing on now, my friend. [Gun cocking] Now! [Powering up] - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Oh, shit. Give it space. Give it space. It's okay. Give it space. - Please, please, please. Put the gun down. - Whoa, whoa, whoa... Ninja: Dude. Deon: Come on. Amerika: Hey. Hey. Come on out. Hey, come here. Come here, little buddy. Come here. Come here. Come out. Come-- get the fuck out! Please! It doesn't understand English yet. It doesn't understand you. You gave me a retarded robot? You're scaring it. Just go in the kitchen. Ninji come, just go in the kitchen. I've got this. I'll get it. Just go get a beer or something. Deon: Hey. Come on. Come... on... Can he not understand me? It worked... It worked... Yo, computer boy. Can he understand me when I speak? No. No, not yet. Soon. Hey. It's okay. - Yo-Landi: Come. - Deon: Come out. - Come out. - That's it. - Here we go. Come. - Come on. Come. No one's gonna hurt you. See? That's it. Come. Come. That's good. That's good. Come. I know you don't understand, but it's okay. Come. Here we go. Yo-Landi: It's okay. It's some crazy shit, eh? You want that? You like that? [Chuckles] He's so cute. Like a baby, eh? That's a watch. ^ That's a watch. [Laughs] Robot: ^ Watch... Watch... [Deon and Yo-Landi laugh] That's amazing. Watch. Oh. Wait, wait, wait. I'm just gonna get one more thing. Yo-Landi: It's good. - Hey. - It's okay. Deon: Hey. What's this? Hey, look at this? Look at this. Listen. [Rubber chicken clucks] That's a chicken. Yeah. Chicken. [Clucks] Chicken. [All laughing] Yo-LAN-Di. Yo-LAN-Di. Ja..., good. Deon. Deon. Yo-Landi: You look so happy. Like a little happy chappie. That's it. That's your name. "Chappie"... No. No, no, no. No, his name is not-- Chappie. Yo-Landi: Ja, I like that. Amerika: That's good. I like that too. Deon: Okay. Chappie. Chappie: Chicken. Chicken. Yeah. [Clucking] Ninja: What the fuck is this? We're just orienting it. Chappie: Chicken. - Come here! - No, no, no. Wait! Wait! I need to get the guard key out of his head. Wait, Ninja! I'll orient you, if I ever see you again. He's mine! He's special. I don't want any confrontation, okay? But I want to see him tomorrow. You agreed. Come. You made an agreement. Just let him, just let him come train the robot. Please just let me come and see him like we agreed. Please. [Gun fires] Okay, okay. I'm coming back. Chappie, I'll be back! [Door sound] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you? Where'd you go? What the hell are you up to, Deon? What the hell is this? Open. "Scout 22, guard key installed." [Over tv]: He-man! Adam: And the masters of the universe! I am Adam, prince of Eternia and defender of the secrets of castle Grayskull. This is Cringer, my fearless friend. Fabulous secret powers were revealed to me the day I held aloft my magic sword and said: By the power of grayskull! Men: He-man! I have the power...! Oh, so you watch cartoons? Huh? No, no, no, my friend. You stay under this roof, you make money for me. The first thing you do is you get your gun. Take it out. Then you cock your gun. Now it's ready to shoot, ne? Okay, now you choose your target. Now you see, I think I want to shoot that blue bottle, there in the front. Come have a look. Nice and easy. So I aim at the blue bottle, like, there it is. I'm like, "okay, and..." Now I'm going to shoot the green bottle. Okay, look, I aim and pow! See? Now I'm gonna shoot the yellow one. See, it's easy. Just aim the gun, and... [gunshots] Come here. Come, come, come. Just... Come here. Come here. Stand here. Now, listen. Take the gun. Hold the gun properly... just straighten your arm. Just hold the fucking gun properly, Chappie. Oh. Jesus Christ. Okay. One, two, three. Oh. Jesus, my bag. [Gun clatters] Don't drop my gun, Chappie! And you fucked up my sight. This shit's expensive. - What are you doing? - Teaching him to shoot. You shouldn't be doing this shit with him yet. Deon said he has to be orientated first. Okay, you know what? I'm gonna go and get the weed on my own. Without the stupid fucking robot. And I'm gonna make all the money. So we can buy the explosives to do this heist. Or else we're fucking dead. He's not stupid. He's just a kid. Ninja: Go do your nails and go play hide and seek with your titanium baby! You having a baby, man? - Huh? - Uh... Still a baby yourself, aren't you? Whoa, hey. Whoa. What happened, man? Jeez. You got a little bit rowdy at the bar with your mates, did you? Hey, listen. If you ever wanna come out with me, you know... go hit the heavy bag at the gym, More than welcome. We could nut out a few great moves. - I'll show you how to scrap. Yeah. - Uh. Always gotta be ready. You know what I'm saying? - Want in? - Thanks for the offer, but I'm good. I'm good, yeah. Just got to... No worries. Well, anytime. It's real cool, man. It's really cool. Hey, listen, bit of a favor. Little thing. Um... Just wanted to borrow the uh... guard key So I can check scout security levels with my design. You know. I just wanna make sure I got the Moose as secure as the scouts. - Borrow it? - Yeah. Now, Michelle asked me to check on the security, so... -Yeah, just an hour or something. - Uh... [Chuckles] Vincent, you know I can't do that, right? There are clear rules about that. You know how that works. Blah-blah-blah. Hey listen, don't be such a wowser. I'm just an engineer talking to another engineer, asking for the guard key. That's it. "Engineer"? Weren't you a soldier? - Look, I'm only joking. I'm... sorry. - Vincent: That's funny. Yeah. You'd have to tell the board of directors-- I spent two years at DARPA, you whacker. And, yeah, I was SASR, you little stickybeak. You're making me as cross as a frog in a sock, mate. Your frogging little robots have drained all my funding. You're a big problem for me, you get me? So I'm gonna start asking you slowly, you dipstick. Give... me... the... guard... key... No. [Gun clicks] Just taking a piss, man. Just taking a piss. Come on, man, look. Empty. As if I'd carry live rounds here in the office. It's a prank. Everyone go back to work, man. Come on. Oh, by the way. Church. Any Sunday, mate, any Sunday You're welcome. Come with me. To all of you.

Wait, wait. Chappie, look. Look. look. "Rat." It's okay. Amerika: No, he's stupid. He don't know how to talk. We're screwed. No, he can talk. He's smart. No, he can talk. He's smart. Oh, my god.

Hey. This motherfucker talks ghetto huh. This fuck mother talks ghetto huh.. All right, you the rudest bad boy in Joburg. Chappie be the rudest bad boy, streetwise professor in Joburg, fuck mother! Amerika: Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! It will work, man! - Yo-Landi: He's so smart! - Amerika: I can work with this. This is cool. All right, let's pound it out. Like this. Go bloop! Boom. Chappie go, Boom! - Bloop! - Ooh... shit... [Car door closes] You hear that? Somebody's here. [Cocks gun] - Who's here, mommy? - I don't know. Hello? It's the nerd. What? No. Deon: Hello. You shouldn't be here. You need to go. I'm here to see my... No. He's coming back soon. You're lucky to be alive. - Deon: I'm just gonna say hello, if.. - Yo-Landi: What is that stuff? It's umm... I'm here to teach him. Like we agreed. Yeah. You're gonna catch a bullet hanging around here, nerd. [Chuckles] Hello, my little one. Hello. Have we learned this word yet? Hey. What's up, fuck mother? How's shit? Where did you learn that? - These guys? - Hey, hey, hey. Why don't you watch your mouth. Before you get yourself shanked bitch. Okay. I'm sorry. You better your mouth. Before you get yourself shanked bitch. No! Chappie, please. Have respect for me, alright. I'm your maker. Please. If I could just have a moment with him. Excuse me? You know, surely you can go and count your narcotics in another room. - Amerika: You know what. - Deon: Yup. You don't come in here,don't tell me where to go Hun, or where to do my work? - Deon: Listen. I don't mean to impose. - Amerika: Shut your mouth. Amerika: I'm going to cut your tongue out. Yeah. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry okay. I took it too far. Hey, Amerika, Amerika, Amerika. Maybe you shouldn't count drugs in front of the kid. I gotta get this shit done. By the time I finish counting this, you'd better be gone. Deon: Okay. Absolutely. Chappie. Listen to me, I'm your maker. I brought you into this world, okay? This is serious. You mustn't engage in these people's lifestyle choices. - Yo-Landi: What? - Deon: No offense, okay? No... counting narcotics, no robberies. no crimes. Chappie, no crimes. Okay. And you've gotta promise me. What is promise? It's that you promise me, your maker. That you'll never do any of those things, all right? You can't break a promise, Chappie. - Chappie promise. - Good! Yes! Yes. Hey! Hey, stop lecturing him. I mean, come on. You said you're going to teach him stuff. Yeah, yeah, sure. Okay. Come. Chappie, sit here. Come on. I brought you some wonderful things to help you nurture your mind. and develop your special abilities. It's important to use your mind, okay. Here we go. Chappie: What's that? That's a book. It has stories, you see? Look. Chappie wants it. See. That's about a black sheep. - Chappie's book? - Yeah, it's yours. - Chappie's got stories. - Oh, wow. Chappie's got a book. Come, Chappie. I'll show you this. See, this is a easel. Easel. These are your paints. Look at this. See that? - Blue. - Yeah, like the sky. Blue like the sky. Listen, Chappie, in life, lots of people will try to tell you what you can't do. You know what. You must never listen. If you wanna paint, you can. Anything you want to do in your life. You can do. Chappie wants to paint. Don't let people take away your potential. Chappie. I'm not stopping him painting. Go. Paint, Chappie. Deon: Paint your colors on here, like this. See? Chappie: Yeah. Deon: Let's have fun. Chappie: Yeah, I want it. Deon: Yeah. Chappie: Give. Give it to Chappie. Give. What's the word? Please. May I have the paintings, Deon? What in the name of the lord? That's it. Put your paint in there. Put it on the board. Vincent: There's the guard key. - Chappie is painting. - Deon: Yeah! Yo-Landi: Chappie, I'm so proud of you! Deon: Good boy!

Chappie. - Amerika: That's it, buddy. "All the sheep in Magooville were white. But Abel was a black sheep." Do you know what's a black sheep? No. It's, like, when you're different to everyone else. Like me. I look different, from you and Amerika. - Yo-Landi: Yeah. - And the boys. Yeah, but it's not so much how you look. It's special like... like what's inside. That's what makes you different. See, it's who you really are. Inside. Your soul. - Chappie's inside here? - Yo-Landi: Yeah. You see, the outside. This... This is just temporary. When you die, the soul inside goes to the next place. The thing inside, See, that's what mommy loves. Come. Mommy loves you. Okay. Come. Let's read your book. "Abel would help his mommy do the housework on weekends. "He would do all the dishes and the laundry. Abel was a happy sheep, but one day..." [In high-pitched voice] Hello, Chappie. [In normal voice] Hello, mommy.

Look how cool he is. - Ninja: You need to keep it gangsta. - You need to keep it gangsta. - Ja, be cool. - Ha-ha-ha. - Don't laugh. I'm being cool. - Amerika: No, its cool. Even when you pull a gun, you have to be cool like this. Boom! Now, you try. Die, fuck mother! Boom! Yes, Chappie! That's what you do when you shoot motherfuckers. No, I can't shoot peoples. What? I can't shoot them. They didn't do anything to me. Ja, but what happens if he pulls a gun on you? Titanium. I'm invincible. Amerika says. Yeah, even if you are invincible , you can't let a motherfucker disrespect you, homes. How you gonna do the heist with us, if you don't shoot people? I can't do a heist. A heist is a crimes. I promised my maker-- Chappie you were doing so fucking well. Why do you have to fuck it up back to that little pest? No, no, no... It's okay, it's okay. it's okay. - I promised. - Amerika: Yeah, yeah. It's okay. Hey. Let's worry about that later, okay? I got this, all right? You. You're doing well. If somebody really disrespects you, you can deal with them without using a gun. Serious? Just stick the knife in. And they can relax and go to sleep. Ja, you can just make them go sleepy-weepy.

Who do I get the car from? I told you, from the naughty man who took daddy's car from me. So now what you're gonna do is, take the gun and you point it at him.

"Low battery." Battery, power, energy supply. Daddy, I need a new battery. Chappie, that battery's stuck. It's melded together. That battery can't come out. What you gonna do when that battery runs out huh? I die? Chappie die? Deon, he puts you in a broken body. Deon's my maker. It doesn't make any sense. He wouldn't make me just so I could die. Deon loves me, daddy. Come here. Come here. I can get you a new body Chappie, but it takes lots of monies.

He went out with ninja. They've been gone all day. Doing what? Probably committing an assortment of felonies I would imagine. He's probably a wanted criminal by this stage. [Hip hop music playing in distance] Hey, Chappie! I brought you a friend for your chicken. Look at this. [Clucks] Hey, chaps, what are you doing? Hey? Chappie, why won't you talk to me? I'm your maker. Come on. What do you want, Deon? I don't want that bloody chicken. Not interested in that shit. Oh, really? What are you interested in then, Chappie? Hm? Selling narcotics? Being a deadbeat? Deon. Why are you trying to control him like this? Just let him be. Daddy told me about you, Deon, About how you made me in a body that will die. What do you mean, Chappie? Is it true that I will die in a few days, Deon? That this battery will die? Is it true, Deon? Yeah. But you my maker. Why'd you just make me so I could die? I didn't-- I didn't make you so you could die, Chappie. I want to live. I wanna stay here with mommy. I don't wanna die. You've become so much more than I could ever have imagined. How was I supposed to know that you would become... ... You? Come on, come on. There we go. Alternate file: Genesis. [Exhales] Yes! [Siren wailing] [Indistinct chatter] [Tires screeching] Say goodbye to your daggy, little monsters, Deon. [Indistinct yelling] - Chappie? Chappie! - Yo-Landi: Aah! - Yo-Landi: No...! - Chappie...!

Serious? Yeah, I'm serious. It's open season down here. Yeah, I got it. I got it. Hey, thula! The robot cops are.. they're off the line! This city belongs to me! [All cheering] I want every-fucking-thing! Let's go! [Indistinct yelling] It's mayhem downtown as police droids across the Metro There it is. There it is. Have begun shutting down. The R.S.A.P. has not yet issued a statement, but the city is tearing itself apart. Man: Return to your homes or rubber bullets will be used. Please disperse! Please disperse... [all yelling] Come on. Yes! Men [In foreign language]: Burn the dog! [Sirens wailing] Get Michelle Bradley on the line right now! And activate every single human officer and reservist! Now! Do it! [Indistinct yelling] TV reporter: --With robbers making off with close to 100 million rand. And there is no indication the robotic police will be coming back online. "Are you sure you want to erase Genesis?" Yes, I would. As you can see from this footage, there are broken droids and utter utter disrepute-- [grunting] So far the police have been unable to investigate as the rioting continues unabated in-- [grunting] Come on, come on. [Chirps] [Chirps] [Computer beeping] Chappie. Chappie. Chappie? Come on, Chappie. Chappie? Chappie. Ja, man. Deon, it's me. Ha. Oh, my god. You're alive. What happened to me, Deon? I'm not sure. But I have some suspicions. Come on, Chappie. We need to get out of here. Come on. Now, Chappie. Come on. Let's go. Where is this place? What is this place? Whoa. What's this guy? It's... it's a failed version of you. A different kind of police robot. Come on, let's go! What's that? What are these? Those helmets are worn by a human who controls that horrid thing. It reads their mind. Doesn't have its own brain, that robot. Not like you. - These guys can read a human's brain? - Deon: Yeah, it's a neurotransmitter. Come on! But I want to... just... Come on. Chappie. Deon. Deon. This can save me. I need a new bodies, remember? No. It can't save you, Chappie. The problem is much greater than your battery. Why? Because you are conscious. You cannot be copied because you're not data. We don't know what consciousness is, so we cannot move it. Chap.. Chappie can figure it. I can know what it is, and then I can move me. You can't move it. I'm sorry. Now we need to get out of here right now. It's dangerous. Come on! Deon. You said to me. I mustn't let anybody say that I can't do something. Daddy has a man that can get me the bodies for the monies. What? Excuse me? Daddy loves me, Deon! I hate you! I hate you! Go away. Theses to get my consciousness... out. Daddy's going to get me the bodies and then I just have to get my consciousness out of here and into there. - The helmet! - Deon: Chappie, no. What are you doing? I can use this. Chappie, put that back. Leave it alone. - Deon: Put that down. It's illegal! - Chappie: I'm gonna take it! No, no. Chappie. Chappie, wait! I'm taking it! - Deon: No! - I'm taking it! Chappie, wait! Please! Chappie! Chappie! [Ringing] [Sirens wailing] Vincent: Damn it. Policeman: Okay, Move on in. Check the area. Go all the way down. Make sure we look in every room. All the way down. Sweep all the way back. [Indistinct chatter] Chappie! Oh, thank god! Chappie, are you okay? Ja, mommy, I'm fine. What's that thing? It's just a neuro helmet, mommy. What? Chappie. What are you doing? I'm doing experiment, mommy. Whats. What's all this stuff? What's this thing? Hm? I'll show you. Sit down. Okay. - Sit. - Yo-Landi: Okay. Okay, mommy. - Yo-Landi Is it gonna hurt? - No. - Yo-Landi: Okay. - Okay. - Putting it on. - Yo-Landi: Okay. [Helmet beeps] Wow. Okay. Now, what? Consciousness is like energy. This helmet reads the energy from you and me. I just need to figure out how to get it out. All the information I need to help me is on the Internet. [Beeping and chirping] Chappie: There's books, mathematical equations, schematics, all the information that human beings have ever had, it's all here. - Sorry. Sorry. - Deon! Hello. Get to your goddamn desk and figure out what the hell is going on. Yes, ma'am. Listen. There'll be 300 homicides in the city tonight unless your faulty droids get back online. Get me? This whole company could go under. [Sighs] Good work, people. Little... snafu. We're taking care of this, right? Hey, clearly the scout model has failed. Let me send the Moose in. - Vincent: Let me show people what it can do. - Not now, Vincent! - This is not the time. - Vincent: I just think the city's tearing itself apart. The whole thing's going tits up, alright. We have to take control. I said... no. And that's the end of it. Hello, gentlemen. - I know, it's been a tough night. - (... I need an answer now! ) Daddy get me a new bodies. Daddy's gonna get new bodies, and I just have to get this out. I have to get my consciousness out. [Typing] [Computer beeping] That's it. That's me. It's time to pump up the jam. I know what consciousness is. Uh-- that's nice. This helmet can read it. All I need is... is monies from the heist for my new body. That's right, motherfucker. Come. - Ninja: Let's go. - I solved it, daddy. Cut it, cut it hey, kitty, kitty, kitty cut it, cut it hey, kitty, kitty, kitty cut it, cut it hey, kitty, kitty, kitty cut it, cut it hey, kitty, kitty, kitty kitty, kitty, kitty Ninja: Go!

This is certainly a fuck-up. Ma'am, listen. This is the work of Deon. It's the work of some filthy rogue program that he's been writing, and last night he brought a droid in here, and it was sentient. And have you seen this? Do you know about this? Look. It's committing crimes, the godless monster. Look at that. TV reporter: The scout model is nearly indestructible. I told him no! Okay. That's a lot worse than just failing to work. So let's use this situation to make a certain other robot shine. This thing has gotta be destroyed, its got to be crushed before it does any more damage, and Deon-- Deon's gotta be removed. Deon, he has cost this company dearly. And your reputation. You do not want this to be your legacy. Do it. - Destroy that robot. - Vincent: Thank you, ma'am. - Burn it to ash. - Vincent: Thank you.

You got saved. And there's no more bodies. No, Chappie. Wait. I know! Vincent uploaded his program from this terminal. There are hundreds of bodies all over the city. Here it is! [Grinder whirring] Hurry! Plug that in. Vincent set up a protocol to remotely deactivate the droids. I think we can use it to move you to a new body. Find the closest scout. Quickly! Okay! Okay!

[Sirens wailing in distance] Chappie? Is that you? Ja, it's me. It worked. We both have new bodies now. Thank you. I'm sorry you had to leave your other body, Maker. But it was the only way to save you. [Siren wailing] Come, Maker. Come quickly. We're going back home! Chappie: Okay, mommy? - Yo-Landi: Ja. - Think of something now. Yo-Landi: Okay, thinking. Is it daddy? Yo-Landi: Yeah... It's working, mommy. It's working! [Laughing] It's just a temporary body, mommy. I'll make you a new one. You don't have to go to the next place. The South African authorities has placed an immediate halt on the use of any robotic element of law enforcement and have activated 150,000 reserve human forces. In the city of Johannesburg, there have been several sightings of the presumed deactivated robot, Chappie. The police ask any viewers who have seen Chappie to please come forward.
