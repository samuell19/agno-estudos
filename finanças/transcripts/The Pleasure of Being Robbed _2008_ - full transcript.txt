Pick a hand. - That one. - [Wayne] You can either choose to serve or give me the serve. - You can have it. - Here we go. One-zero. Zero-two, your serve. Zero-three. - Jesus, be careful! - Listen, - What? why are you even here? - [Eleonore] To play table tennis. Well this is close, but not quite table tennis. - Come on., let's just play. - Listen. - It's really fun, come on. - [Wayne] But look, people are here spending time and energy to play in this tournament and you're here doing this stuff. - I know, but it's fun and I'm usually really good-- - Well, I think you're wasting your money and their time. - [Eleonore] Come on, just give me another try. - Alright. - Alright, my serve. - [Wayne] Zero-three, your serve. (men chattering) - [Wayne] 10-seven. Eight-10. - Hey Wayne. What are you doing outside? Why aren't you playing? I lost in the advance to this big lefty looper, so I'm out. - [Eleonore] (laughs) You lost? - Yeah, it happens. - [Eleonore] Okay. So, what are you gonna do? - That's my tournament. I'm out of it. I'm gone, that's it. (laughs) Hey listen, don't laugh. - [Eleonore] I'm sorry. - I've played in tournaments all over the country and clubs all over the world and you are the worst player I've ever had the displeasure of having to play. - (scoffs) Gee, Wayne. - [Wayne] That's the truth. It's a tough game. - Well I'm sorry. I mean, I just wanted to have a little fun, you know. Look, at least get a decent backhand. You've got this weird backhand hacker-wacker thing. It annoys people when it doesn't hit the table. Right now, you've got this kind of lifting, lobbing thing. What you have to do is draw your wrist into here. And when you hit backhand, you hit-- (splatting) (laughing) Go away. Go away.

Well, I guess I'm just kind of trying to find the car that fits this key. - What do you mean, find the car that fits this key? (laughs) Is that a joke? - No, it's-- - Are you looking for your car? - I guess I just kind of found this bag. - [Josh] Okay. - And inside this bag there was this set of keys. And I just want to see what car it turns on. - Alright. - Yeah. - [Josh] I'll help you do that. - Really? - [Josh] Yeah, why not? What else do I have to do, so, alright. - You weren't doing anything tonight? - I'm just biking, you know, what are you? What do you know about what the car looks like? - Well... - What do we know? Tell me, fill me in. I'm totally out of the loop. - Okay. Well I guess I sort of actually picked up this whole bag. - Uh huh. - And inside there was just a bunch of stuff. And then there's also this camera. One of the pictures is a picture of a woman. She's standing next to a car. - Okay. Does the car key have a name on it, or a model or anything? - Oh, God, I don't know. - Yeah it's a Volvo key. - Oh, yeah. - So we just have to look for a Volvo. Well, I've been trying all of the cars on this street-- - There's a Volvo right here. Gimme the key. So yeah, this looks like a match. Well, it looks like a car, not a match, but. - Yeah, but it's not gonna be the same car as in the picture. - No, it's gonna work. I just don't think that this is the one, Josh. - Only because you have to let me do this thing that generally is successful for me, okay. This key is going to fit in this car and it is going to work. It's going to open this car only because I'm saying that. (laughs) It fits in. - [Eleonore] It fits? - Yeah. - [Eleonore] Open up the door. - It's not quite opening, though. - Well, look. Right across the street there's a car that looks exactly the same it's just a different color. Gimme the keys. - [Josh] No, this is gonna work. - Gimme the keys! - I guess it is - This is the one. the exact same car. - This is the one, I'm sure of it. - Alright, well. - [Eleonore] Here, toss me the keys again. - Alright. - [Eleonore] Okay. - You have black stuff all over your finger now. - [Eleonore] I don't care. - Alright. - [Eleonore] Well it fits in the key-- - Alright does it turn? It fit in that one, too. Did it turn? - It turned. - No way! - [Eleonore] Ah hah! - [Josh] You wanna open the door for me? - [Eleonore] Huh? - [Josh] You wanna open the door for me? - [Eleonore] Oh. - [Josh] Thank you. You can't throw keys at a door. - Hmm. That's not how doors unlock. - [Eleonore] Okay, well I'll figure it out better next time. - [Josh] That's like getting to your front door and just throwing the keys at the door. - [Eleonore] Wow, look at all this stuff in here. Check this out. - Tide. (laughs) - [Eleonore] This is the best. There's so much great stuff back here. - Oh, fuck. - Huh? - I got Tide all over my jacket. - Smells really nice though? - Could be worse, right? - [Eleonore] Yeah. - Where are we going? - What do you mean? I almost licked this off my hand. (laughs) I did. My instinct was to lick. Oh something spilled on me, lick it off your hand. I can't believe we actually did this. - [Eleonore] I am so cool. - [Josh] Here. - Look at my Volvo. (laughing) What am I supposed to do with those? - [Josh] Turn the car on. - What do you mean? I don't know how to drive. - [Josh] Put your, come on. Turn the car on. - [Eleonore] Josh, I've never driven a car before. - Really? - Really. I'm not gonna drive this car, no way. (laughs) - [Josh] What were you planning on doing when you found the car? Just sit in it like this? - I don't know. I just thought it would be fun to look around inside. - It's really easy to drive, I'll teach you. That way when you think back on it ten years from now, ugh, this Tide is disgusting, you'll say, I know how to drive, Josh taught me. (car dings) (engine turns over) There you go. Turn the lights on. Oh look, you got a ticket. - I have a ticket already. (laughs) - Here, grab, unroll the window. Alright, now stick you hand out and grab the ticket. I'm gonna put the windshield wipers on. No, you gotta lean forward. - (laughs) My first ticket. - Yeah. - Shit. - [Josh] They make them so you can't do that because they know how angry people get when they get tickets. - [Eleonore] Ugh, whatever. - [Josh] Alright, so I'll teach you how to drive. You really don't know how to drive. - No, I have no idea. Alright. - The car is on though, right? - Yeah, so first turn on the lights. - Let me adjust my mirror, sit back - Okay. Right on me. - Perfect. - So that way if you don't, I'm your blind spot now. - Okay. - Alright. So you want to turn on the lights first. - Uh huh. Alright, put your foot on the brake cause that's the only way you can kinda change gears. - I have it on it, yeah. - P is for park, R is for reverse. N is for neutral, D is for drive, three is for three, - Hang on. L is for L. - Okay, I got it. - So there's two pedals obviously. - Yes. - The right one is the gas. The left one is the brake. And you wanna-- (engine revs) - [Josh] That's the gas. - Yeah. - And the brake doesn't make a sound. - Okay. - [Josh] Unless you're going really fast and need to come to a stop and then it makes a terrible sound. - Right. - Oh, you've got to put your hands on the steering wheel. This kind of controls the car. Alright, I'm going to put you in reverse. - Mmhmm. Reverse, why? - Yeah. - I don't know how to drive backwards. - [Josh] Well, that's what you do. You've got to learn it. - [Eleonore] Do I have to look behind? - [Josh] I mean, most people do. - [Eleonore] Can you just tell me? - [Josh] Okay, I'll just tell you, go, go. Okay, okay. (thuds) Let's not give it any gas. (laughs) Alright, slowly take your foot off the brake and you'll start moving automatically. - My foot is shaking like crazy. - [Josh] Well, slowly release it off. - Okay. (thuds) - [Josh] Okay, a little bit more. A little bit more. (laughing) A little bit more. - Am I doing alright? - [Josh] Yeah, you just gotta keep going back. - (laughs) I can see your ear. - We'll get there. We can get there. - Wait, look at me when I'm doing this. - [Josh] Okay, go back. Alright, we're going to put you in drive. - [Eleonore] I want to get out of this spot right away. - [Josh] Alright, you gotta cut the wheel. - [Eleonore] Okay. - [Josh] All the way, don't give it any gas. Don't give it any gas. Don't give it any gas, okay. - [Eleonore] Okay. Keep going. - [Josh] Keep going, okay now. Are we going to hit that bike? (laughs) Alright. Wait, wait wait wait wait wait. - [Eleonore] No. - [Josh] Go, give it, let go. I mean, normally the driver holds on to the wheel. You alright? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Alright. Let's reset this mirror, so that it... - [Eleonore] Yeah, turn it more so that I can... - [Josh] I can't really do it for you, though. - Okay. - Is that good? - [Eleonore] No, well, it's okay. - [Josh] I'll hold the wheel. I think that's good. - [Josh] You want to go a little faster - Okay. just because there's a lot of cars behind us? - (horn honks) Okay! Shall I just let that car pass? - [Josh] Alright he passed so you can go. That's alright. Well, we've missed the light now. It's alright. It's okay. (laughs) - [Eleonore] That's okay right? - [Josh] You're doing well, you're doing well. - I am? - Yeah. Alright, you want to stop now for the red light. Okay, when you use the brake, you don't have to turn the car off when we come to a stop. - [Eleonore] I guess that cab passed me. - [Josh] Do you want to turn the car back on? - [Eleonore] Sure. - Okay. - Clockwise? - [Josh] Yes, wow. So we're surrounded by cabs. - [Eleonore] Okay. - [Josh] It's like a driver's worst nightmare. - [Eleonore] I'm going to turn right. - Alright. Right now? - You have to turn right. - Tell me when. - [Josh] Now, with the light. (horn honks) Oh, shut up! We have a driver learning how to drive here. - [Eleonore] Okay, tell him to pass. Tell him to pass. - [Josh] Sorry. (horn honking) You alright? - Yeah I'm okay. - You getting the hang of it? - [Eleonore] Yeah, I think so.

Whose purse is this? - [Woman] It's my purse. - Get your hands outta there. - I just wanna look through it. - Get your hands outta there. - I just wanna look through it. - Put your hands on the rail.

You're only making it harder. Don't resist. - [Eleonore] It hurts. - You're being arrested. - [Officer] Let's check the bag. (police radio chatter) (sighs) (telephone rings) - [Officer] Can you believe this? - You think you could answer that for me? - [Officer] She's getting a cell call. - [Eleonore] Just answer it. Just ask who it is. - [Officer] Hello? - [Eleonore] Tell them I'll call them back. - [Officer] No this is not Elaine. Listen, she's under arrest. You don't give a shit? Listen, this is a police officer talking to you, alright? This is not a game. She's under arrest. You can talk to her later when she gets out. You wanna leave a message, fine, other than that I can't help. This fuckin' prick just hung up on me, you believe this? - [Officer] Who the hell was that? (police radio chatter) - [Officer] Central, 10-five that message. Somebody harassing animals at the zoo? - We're going to the zoo? (doors thud) Hey, wait, where are you guys going? You're just gonna leave me here? - [Officer] We're going to the zoo. Why, you wanna come? - I've never been to the Central Park Zoo before. - [Officer] Oh I suppose you want a hot dog too with mustard, sauerkraut. - [Eleonore] I've never been to the zoo before. - C'mon, we can't leave her here. - [Officer] Alright, take her out, c'mon. - C'mon. I've been to the Bronx Zoo, I've been to the Prospect Park Zoo, but I've never been to the Central Park Zoo before. - [Officer] What are you doing? She's our prisoner. - It's okay. - [Eleonore] C'mon, it's okay. - That's what I got this for. - Will you put your stick back in your pants. Alright, hold on, hold on. Don't go nowhere. We got you. - [Eleonore] Oh, okay. This'll be fun. So we're just gonna wait around here? - Yeah. - Do we have to? Can we go inside for a little bit? - I don't think that's a great idea. - Yeah, but, can we just go inside and just look around a little bit. We don't have to go near them. We can just look around the zoo for a little while. - I can't. I can't do it. - Please? Please. - I don't think that's a good idea. (men laughing) - [Eleonore] Please. - Ten minutes. Not a minute less. - [Eleonore] Okay. - Ten minutes. - [Eleonore] Ten minutes, that's it. - [Officer] Ten minutes. - Okay, okay. - Ten minutes. - [Eleonore] Okay.

Officer what exactly are you charging me with? Petting an animal at a zoo? Is that what you're gonna charge me with? - [Officer] His number should be at the desk. You can call him directly, man. - Hey man, is there any way you can take the cuffs off me? 'Cause my mom lives here and I'll just tell her that I was, like, paying a parking ticket or something. Officer can you take the cuffs off me? - [Officer] As soon as we get inside, my man. - [Man] Can you do it now? I don't wanna-- - [Officer] You'll have to wait for the sergeant on that. (door thuds) Yo, where's your hat? - Sorry. - And don't forget the bag either. The sarge sees you without that hat we'll never here the end of it. - [Officer] Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right. (door thuds) (clears throat) Go in, make a left.

It was named after this beautiful lady here. I think her father gave her that name after a butterfly that he tried to catch. I don't think he caught the butterfly. (emotional piano music)
