You really hurt me this time. All right. See you next Friday, same time, same place. It's unheard of. Something like this hasn't happened in years. I'm sorry but the decision of the Executive Committee hasn't been in your favour. But... Didn't they consider my diligence? In a year, I could repay the amount I've withdrawn. It's not a question of reimbursing what you've embezzled. It's a matter of principle. A philanthropic foundation doesn't need a manager who's just pocketed $100,000. You surely know that. I wonder, sir, if I could lodge an appeal to the Board. The decision of the Executive Committee is irrevocable. You should be grateful that the matter won't be taken to court. We don't want scandals. I thought highly of you. No, I really can't tonight. Yes, we agreed but I really can't this once. I'm so sorry for leaving you in the lurch at the last minute. Hold on, will you? But, darling, it's not my fault. It's just... I don't feel well. Yes, all of a sudden. It's my liver. That's what it is. Where am I? At the doctor's. You know I'd never lie to you. Oh, no. Of course it's not a money matter. I don't feel well. I've a fever and I've got a high temperature. I can't... Let's put it off until next Friday. I'd like to speak to the director. - Miss Ergstrom is here. - Who? - Miss Ergstrom, from the press office. - Let her in. He'll see you now. Ergstrom. - A Swedish surname, isn't it? - I'm always forgetting it. - I've only been working here a month. Tell me. I'm sorry to bother you but I need more material for my bulletin on male sterilisation in India. I need trade publications. I'd gladly give them to you, but I've got them at home. - I can drop by and get them. - There's no hurry. I'll bring them Monday. I hate to insist but I was hoping to get the article completed over the weekend. You've a very odd way of spending your weekends. I seem to concentrate more on weekends. I can shut myself off from people and not be distracted. Are you personally for or against sterilisation? I'm all for it. A man who already has two or three children can be perfectly sterilised. Why should the women always be the ones to take precautions? The pill is harmless. The sterilisation means permanent incapacity. It's a monstrous barbarity. I agree that the great increase in population must be curbed. But only by means that don't lessen man's potential. Like, through modern educational programs. Through... a repeated appeal to responsibility. Publication and diffusion of various methods. And if that isn't enough, through the use of the pill. It is essential that the fertility of the man should remain absolutely intact. - Is that clear? - My personal opinion apart, I'll write a report to your satisfaction. - I sincerely hope so. - May I come for those publications? Alright, do come. The address is rather hard to find. I'll expect you at 8.30. Thank you. Goodbye. I can't understand their meaning, but they're charmingly decorative. They were painted by a missionary. He copied the microscopic slides of various types of bacteria and protozoa. Bubonic plague. Leprosy. Typhus. Cholera. Carbuncles. Tetanus. Diphtheria. Rabies. What's this one? Trypanosoma gambiense. It causes the sleeping sickness. It's the one I like the best. Would you like a whisky? No ice. - Do you like my little collection? - Yes, it's very interesting. I've never thought you had such a hobby. After all, we don't know each other well. The only thing I know about you is that you're a pretty and very enthusiastic journalist. I know a little more about you. You're a philanthropist, a bachelor, and you've a very impressive collection of daggers. They're nothing special. The valuables are few. This one, for instance. A Florentine work, 15th century. Apparently, it belonged to Giuliano de' Medici. It has an inside groove, for poison. Please, untie me. Why? From an aesthetic point of view, your position is perfect. You shape a long, sinuous line against the grid's straight bars. Very feminine. You are mad. No, darling. I'm not mad. You are. You and all the other women. You want to rule the world. You're making yourselves self-sufficient. Socially and sexually self-sufficient. Do you realise what you're saying? Enough of this buffoonery. There are specialised units where the sperm of the most intelligent men is frozen. So that in 10, 20, or 50 years, a woman can pick the child she wants. Blond or dark. Blue-eyed or brown-eyed. Athletic or intellectual. Football fan or music lover. What does it matter if the father's dead? What does it matter if there are other living men and sexually useful? It doesn't matter at all. Woman won't need them. She'll only need a tube of sperm to be chosen from a rack, like an aperitif or a tonic. Please, I beg you, let me go. Come to your senses. And you won't even have the unpleasantness of seeing your beautiful belly distorted by pregnancy. Four weeks after fertilisation, you'll deposit the unripe fruit in a special incubator. Please. Stop it. Female rabbits have already learnt how to reproduce by parthenogenesis. All on their own. Without any help from the male. They breed exclusively female offspring. And you, women, will learn to reproduce like that. Giving birth to females only. A world populated by females alone. The tranquillising influence of the full moon at the moment of birth channels the onanistic instinct toward extroversion. Gemini with Mercury on ascendant will accentuate masochism and sadism. Those born in the early morning, will have a tendency towards masochism with sublimation of sadistic urge. Cancer with the Moon on ascendant gives rise to necrophilia. However, it'll never be put into practise and it will be replaced by scopophilia. Lion with the Sun on ascendant is responsible for pederasty as a never-accomplished taste, and for sodomy which is instead widely practised at an adult age. If the Moon was in the first quarter at the time of birth, these tendencies will be manifested in a rather mild way. You've been listening to: "Sexual Aberrations and the Stars" You have to make love with him and prove that you enjoy it. Use all your femininity. Hold him. Hold still. Hug him. Come on, hold him tight. Kiss him. On the mouth. On the mouth. More heatedly. More heatedly, I said. Are you deaf? Very gently, mind you. With a touch of gracefulness. Especially between the toes. Pay a very special attention. Good girl. Now, further up. Ankles take more energy. Energy. Haven't you any strength in your arms? That's better. Now, the other foot. Well done. Obey my orders promptly and do everything with diligence. You must be aware that you're my slave. I can do with you whatever I want. Even kill you, if I feel like it. Understand? Please, take me back to town. I swear I won't do anything against you. No one will ever know what happened here. I've done everything you wanted me to. I can't stand it anymore. Let me go. But why? Why me? I'm not sexy. I'm just like other girls. Why you? It happened by chance. Nothing but chance. You've replaced the victim I missed at the last moment. The poor girl felt sick. A liver attack. I needed a woman for the weekend and I took advantage of the fact that you were there. At an arm's reach. You can drink it. There's no narcotic. It's too soon to kill me, isn't it? You had too little fun with me. It'd be a pity to waste me. Eventually... I've sworn that I wouldn't say a word. That I'll forget all this forever. But, you don't want believe me. I see. Why taking the risk? It's so much simpler to kill me. And much more exciting. It can't be the first time. This is just another of your amusing weekends. How many women have you dragged here? Tortured and killed, then disposed of? You may as well admit it, for all the difference it will make. Talk. Say something. At least have the courage to look me in the eye. Coward. Why don't you kill me now? Here I am. Kill me. What are you waiting for, you murderer? Please, go get my cigarettes. They're in a box, on the sideboard. Well? My cigarettes? Coming. You thought I was so foolish? You're such a fool. I set a little trap for you and you walked right into it. You need to cool off a little. Turn around. Come closer. You can't imagine the pleasure it gives me to look closely at a woman gripped by fear. I'd be wonderful to feel, perceive, what is going on inside you right now. The adrenal glands are secreting a greater discharge of adrenalin. The adrenaline is contracting the blood vessels, slowing the circulation and producing that livid pallor in your face. At the same time, your blood pressure and cardiac rhythm are intensifying. Your heart is pounding, and an aching emptiness fills your stomach. The sweat glands are over-active. Your hands are soaked in cold sweat. But the salivary glands seem to be blocked. Your mouth is dry. Your throat is hoarse and raspy. Your tongue... Your tongue is glued to the palate, as you taste the bitter taste of gall. Your personality no longer exists. You're ready to obey blindly. I can give you any order and you'd obey me, won't you? To have under one's observation a woman prisoner knowing that she's at death's door is a spectacle of rare charm. But it's even more exciting to know that, in her brain, despite the gnawing terror, there's still a grain of hope. This is where the pleasure comes in, from nurturing that prospect of salvation. And then, at the moment when the victim is under the delusion that her life is saved, you crush her under your foot. - How many women have you killed? - Quite a few, I suppose. You join carnally with your victims? I kill them at the moment of climax. Have you always had sex this way? Always. You're not tired of that yet? Do you know that you're not here to do an interview? Don't worry. I'm won't use this for a news article. I only wanted to see if you're ready to switch to another game. What do you mean? Stop it while there's still time. Until now, you got away with it, but it won't last long. The same tortures, the same screaming... In the long run, all the victims end up looking alike. And blood is still only blood. I'm sure you're no longer getting the same thrills. Even if that were true, - I have no alternative. - Yes, you do. Think about it. You're a handsome, rich and intelligent man. You can have all the women you want. You can have hundreds of them with the least effort. You could make them yearn for you. Make them suffer or cry. Or even drive them to suicide. Believe me, you don't have to torture and kill to satisfy your sadistic drives. There are erotic techniques that are just as enjoyable and a lot less risky. - Interesting. - Yes, it is. One day, you'll discover that you like a woman in a new, special way. She'll become the woman of your life. You'll be happy. You'll be cured. So you want to cure me? Admit that you only want to save yourself. No. I want to cure you of your disease. I'm not afraid of death. I believe in reincarnation. Hindu or Pythagorean? - Hindu. - That's interesting. You must get over it. You must free yourself from your complexes and fears. Have faith in your own virility. Think how exciting that could be. Think of the satisfaction of dominating a woman with your male strength. With your manly appeal. Try to imagine the beauty of love-making at liberty. In a field, on a beach, in a high grass, in the water. It can be wonderful in the water. - When do we begin this cure? - Even now. It's a summer night. Scent flowers from the garden. The gate leads into a dark, deserted park. I'm waiting for the man I love. I'm shivering from excitement. I'm so happy. He's coming up to me and he's smiling at me. I can feel his strong arms holding me tight. I'm tingling all over. I'm light as a feather. It's as if I've plotted out the world. Enough. The role of a romantic girl doesn't suit you. You're acting it out awfully bad. You must find a sexual character. More dynamic. More... Forget it. You'd better think of your afterlife now that you're so close to it. Think what you're going to be in your new reincarnation. A man? Yellow or black? A Persian cat or a sewer rat? A laughing hyena, perhaps? No. You'll reincarnate to a scorpion. Female, naturally. A huge, voracious, deadly female scorpion. Shut a woman in there and she will go mad and die in just a few hours. I haven't tried it yet but I guess it's quite amusing. The victim can barely breathe and can't make the slightest movement. She can only roll her eyes. By their expression, you can read all the phases of madness, agony and death. All that in a complete silence. In an absolute immobility of the body. No, please. Don't be afraid. I don't want you to try it on. I've got another dress for you. Something more comfortable. Do you want to play something? Let's hear it. Go on. Don't stop. You whore. What's wrong? Shut up. No, please. What are you going to do now? Go ahead, kill me. Kill me. I'd rather die now than go out of my mind, waiting to be murdered. What are you waiting for? I can't stand it any more. Do it. Kill me. Mary. Come on, drink. It'll do you good. Another sip. Good. You have to move around. Try to walk. Come on. Don't stop. You must try harder. That's right. Keep waking. Why didn't you let me die? Don't be foolish. - How do you feel? - Better. I feel a little warm right now. It's all over now. I won't hurt you anymore. That's what you say now and you probably believe it. But you'll kill me just as you killed all those women. I've never killed anyone. The photos were all staged. The blood was fake. The victims, screaming... It was all fake. They're professionals. They do it for money. I normally spend the weekends with one of them so I can give vent to my manias. I went off my head last night. That was the first time I'd ever kidnapped a woman. I had a real victim in my hands. For the first time, it wasn't fiction, it was real. You cannot even imagine how exciting it was. I could finally make my obsession come true. To kill a woman for real. Just when... I raised those scissors, I felt I wouldn't... ever be able to do it. You know, I like you better with the short hair. Don't move. Quick. No, please. Not here. You know how scorpions make love? Just as they're about to reach the climax, the female eats the male. I saw it once when I was a boy. I must've been 12 or 13. I still remember it. I thought they were fighting. My father explained all to me. It came as a terrible shock. I picked up a rock... and I pounded that greedy female to a pulp. I couldn't get that sight out of my head. I was convinced that all women made love like that. Eating the male. Glad to see you again, sir. Do you wish to go straight to your table, or the young lady would rather visit the castle first? I do want to look around. The dwarves slept here. They were the court jesters. Look. After you. About 400 years ago, a duke lived here and he was suffering from insomnia. So, he'd call the dwarves during the night. They'd come through that passage and they entertained him. Somebody might come in. Don't you worry. Visitors never come up here. We're lost. It isn't easy finding a way out of all these rooms and corridors. - We'd like to go to the restaurant. - Come with me. I love you. Cats are keen on me. They seem to know me. Maybe they sense I love them. Extraordinary creatures. So beautiful, sensual, gentle... And then suddenly they become aggressive, dangerous. When I was a girl, I must have been 14 or 15, a cat fell in love with me. I mean it. He looked at me with that mysterious desire that cats have. He came running up behind me and suddenly leap on my shoulder, purring and brushing his whiskers all over my ears. He had long whiskers, incredibly sensual. Whenever he found me in bed, he almost made love to me. You don't believe me? Yes, of course. He'd press his claws into my belly, but softly, without hurting me. He'd nuzzle his little nose into my breasts, purring. His eyes shut tight, his whiskers all fingertips. Cats feel with their whiskers, you know? Did you know that? Yes, I know. He'd fan my legs with his tail, trembling all over. Can I take your order now? An aperitif, to start with? Hors d'oeuvres? We have some very fresh oysters from Ostend. For me, eggs tartare and a little venison. Royal pheasant à la Gonzaga. Perfect. Your order, sir? Try to imagine the beauty of love-making at liberty. In a field, on a beach, in a high grass, in the water. It can be wonderful in the water. Think how exciting that could be. The satisfaction of dominating a woman with your virility, with your manly appeal. With your male strength. One day, you'll discover that you like a woman in a new, special way. She'll become the woman of your life. You'll be happy. You'll be cured. I must get over it. I must free myself from my complexes and fears. I must have faith in my male strength. Are you satisfied? Absolutely. Word for word as you described it. It wasn't a fair play game. You knew what would happen to you, before you even started. It's true. I knew it. Anyway, our man wasn't tough. Now I've lost one of my best customers. He was like the rest. Don't worry. You'll find as many men of that kind as you like. They'll pay to beat you up and humiliate you, just to feel superior. Dreamers. Don't be content with their money. Learn to hit back and destroy them at their own game. You'll enjoy it.
