You say always. - Only when I work. So Allwayso. Can we go? I have two weddings tomorrow. - Tomorrow! We're late! - It's not that fast. I must... He would be awfully happy if you were there. To cheer. Yeah! If we miss the game, it doesn't matter whether she comes or not. You're right. - Well, I come. Promised. Wow, can we get that written? - I'm coming! Let's go! Good, good, good! Come! Pass it - To me! Run over! Pass forward! Come! Run! Beautiful! Flank it! - Here! Shoot! Gosch! Very nice! Very nice! Where the hell is she? - Women have their own clock. It ticks from 30 and breaks, if they get pregnant. Great! Now come on, give pressure! Pressure! Two minutes! Concentrate! Stay out of the fantasy world. Get it? - Shootl! Put more pressure! Yes! Come on! - And now... - - Dream pass to Moritz! Not again! The audience can't keep their seats. A bedlam! Come on, Moritz. Finish it, Moritz! Lahm and Podolski are here. But Moritz does it himself. That will be the draw! Shoot! - No! - - What a loser! He did it again. - Yeah! Yeah! Haha! Man! I served it on a silver tray. Man! The Southwest Cup goes to our guests from VfB Epplaken! Goal! Goal! Sorry. Well... See ya. - You're dead. Or rather not. You played well, it's not the problem. Moritz, come to me please? What was that moment? Why do we discuss it time and again? Team spirit. Concentration and all that. I don't know. I thought ... - You were dreaming. Go, take a shower now! You only had to head in! I don't understand at all. I wanted to try my "Moritz kick". - Man, play simple soccer! Can't you? - Next tournament we'll win. In four weeks I'll do my Moritz kick. - You simply don't get it. Come on, guys. - He messed up the game. What was this action like?! - This Moritz and his kick! Moritz. What are you doing here? - A promise is a promise. Don't tell me the game is over. Basti, Tobi, Joschi! Grown up well! You can't just enter the boys cabin. Why not? - It's for boys only. The sign says "Boys". - I've often seen boys naked. You were often running around naked. - Let's change issue! You were always in the open. You hated clothes. Mama, you're not helpful at the moment. - I'm sorry you lost the game. I'll make your favorite dessert. - Apricot pie? Yes, but not at home. In the hotel. - Something to celebrate? How about our family and that we love each other? We celebrate the most important things in life, so we don't forget. Right. Your dad will be surprised, when we... Ah... Ah... Janina, please wait. I made a huge mistake. Please don't go away. I beg you! Moritz... To Grampa Rudi? We never visit Grampa Rudi. Will we be welcome at all? - I don't know. Does he have room? - I don't know. And for how long... - I don't know! Papa! Papa? Hello? What are you doing here? Hi, Papa. Have you thrown off your customer at last? - No, but he did. Take this. I just packed my things and cancelled my job. Hi, Grandpa. You're grown up. He's grown quite well Super. Really super. - Hey. Now you look at this. Mama's old nursery. Still quite comfortable here, right? Look, your own tv. I don't need a tv, I need a soccer field. Yes. Grandpa says he knows the soccer club's president. He thinks he can make an appointment. How long will we stay here? - I... - I... - "I don't know." Moritz. Don't set on a journey in the near future, Grandpa will be pleased for sure. - That's how he is. I want to go home. - I know, sweetheart.. I know. There! Turn it on! He has a new computer game. This is our new one. Please say hello to... How was your name? - Moritz. Mori... Maurice. - Moritz! Exactly. Stephan, stop with that nonsense. Maurice ... Kevin, stop it! I've seen that. Go and pick a place, please. Be a bit quiet. Sammy, stop that and sit down. Serenity Now! Maurice, just sit down please. Chic hairstyle, but the children's casting is next door. That's a hit! Turn to page 34. Exercise A and B, you should prepare at home. Who comes first? Catrina, already? - My Jet had a breakdown. - You go for guys now? Not noticed? Grow up finally! Hi. I am Moritz. Which Children's Home are you from? Wow! This is cooler than in our village Hulstorf. Everything banana. Mama says you've even played once. - Waste of time. But ... - Must you always chat that much? Use your arms, Knees higher! Hello, Rothkirch. Ah. The famous Rudi Schneider. What splendor in our cabin! Stop driveling! My grandson wants to play soccer. Haven't I seen you before? - Dunno. Maybe. Mark! The little boy wants a trial. We are better now. So we meet again. And you want to play soccer with us? Probably not a good idea. - We always need a goalgetter. Really? You're not angry about the nose? - Rubbish! Guys, this colleague wants to play with us. Let's test his touch! Ah! Next time, there are bowling balls. - Get lost! Serves him right. - The Loser. Yes! Like I said, everything banana. - I call again. Already done? Moritz, time for dinner! Do you like it? - Mhm. I'm going to look for a job. That is London. Paris is still coming. - Stupid, to reside at the Do you eat with us? - I have to go. To Paris? He misses your Grandma very much. They were married for 30 years. Won't you listen? Are we in the zoo, or what? - No, you pay zoo admission. Will your parents divorce too? Our Mum always makes monster-sandwiches, since Baba has gone. Who was responsible? Your father? - Has a crush on the secretary. Bastard! Real? Ours as well. Say it right to everyone at school. - Hey, Mehmet! The new one's dad has a crush on his secretary. Shut up! Enes! What was that? - Guys the new one thinks you're shit! Shut up! Wow. This is the Freak with his gang. The Freak? Alex.- The Psycho. Was once a normal boy. Top-striker from VfB. Then suddenly, he murdered his own brother. I swear to you, it's a question of time before he strikes again. So you think we are shit? - Huh... Why don't you get your own team? Great idea, Einstein. There's only one club in this city. And only one soccer field. - You think, you have to join the VfB? You can go to Braka! It takes two hours. You idiots! Did you talk about VfB? - We would never do that, Oh well! Is this your new top-striker? You haven't been to the Town Hall. Registration for the Cup game. Today only. You don't have a team. Or is that your team now? Gosh, hey. That's it, about the game. Eh. End is by the referee's whistle. Well, that's the only soccer field here. But it doesn't work at all. Is but perfekt! What? This is the full dump here! - Hey, Mehmet. Imagination! Imagine this cleaned up before. - I apply myself to. Wow! Still looks like a garbage dump. Cleaning up? Are you sick? We can not start a club. Why not? - Because one that simply does not. Is here sanitary? - Shut up! The whole field is a shithouse. At least we need no money investing for a new sign. Oops. "Teufelsstadion." Cool name! "Teufelskicker". At the last minute. The coach has to fill out the forms. Uhm, he is sick in bed. - Fill in here names and address! Hm? Rudi Schneider. Yes. He is in bed with ahm... Enes. Enes? - A Turkish flu virus. Highly contagious. I would be vaccinated. Aha. Doesn't it work? - No. I wouldn't do either. Exactly. Thank you. Uh, what? No! You must try it more often! I've already called three times today. - Three times? Yes. - Call every five minutes! Until she can no longer ignore you. - Hmm, she'll call the cops. I think you're not so bad. - I'm even worse. I have a great wife and behave like an ass. Yes! I think you're quite okay. Except that you're a shit defender. But that's not important now because you have the Flo. And the Flo has a plan. Will you please stop that? And... - Shit! Help! Help! Help! Help! Can you manage it? - Yes. Yeah! - Give me please a T, E, U, F... - Shut up, Enes! Teufelskicker! Why can't I play too? Warden is so boring. Because you're a dwarf, you goofy! And we can't go for the tournament? - Why not? Because it starts within two weeks, hello! So we have to slave away. Any who must show Mark, like it is, right? - What the hell have I done now? - - Girls! Hurry up. - We don't wanna wait all day long. Am I stupid or what? Mark is full the Fullpipe! "Don't you apply the event? Ah, you have no team." "Or is that your team now? You idiots, did you talk about VfB?" "Is this your new Top-striker?" Not bad. You, comedian. But I'm not on comedy. More on action. For example, Jet Li I think is fully cool. I am thinking about a scene from "Gei ba ba de xin". "Get ready, to bite the Dust". Nau do si dai! Ha! What do you think, piece of shit? That you can beat us? None beats the VfB. The Freak. We'll meet again, when you are without your Bodyguard. Come on, we beat it! Shit! I've heard you have a team. First, do not press! Second, pick the bull by the horns! Take your time, then it comes. Hello? - Hello?! Holger, it doesn't fit now. - When then? No pressure. - I don't know. - Hello. No pressure. - This is Dad. Want to speak to him? Take more control! Should I go on a message? - No. Well, yes. Tell him we'll meet in the finals! What does he mean by that? - Push down the bull! Where am I to know? - Ride the bull! Is there anyone with you? - No. Down with the bull! Yes! Pull him! -Shh! Make him to your subject! Yes! I am alone here . - Come down! Yesl Yes! - Janina, You can...Yes, yes. The Bull...- That's Flo. I'm not there. It messes up everything. I haven't seen Flo. - I'm at sea. Bye, Holger. Bye, Flo. - Bye. Janina... Uh... Forthly... Hello. Food from Mama. Mmh! Your mother is a pain. - Rudy. I need to talk to you about something. Wow! Come on! Your mother has learned to cook from Grandma. Hmm. What I wanted to tell you ... - When your Grandma had bread in the oven, Man! I have the fragrance still in my nose. Give me a beer. Should you drink here, anyway? - Should you ask so many questions? Did you get some power as a soccer player? -Well, hello, First striker. - Who was second? Rothkirch. And today he is the boss and I am the night watcher. Life is funny, huh? You were in a team? We were even friends. Until Marianne showed up. The dog was so crazy about her. But she has taken me. You really played at VfB? - VfB came later on. That was still in the Neuenfels-Stadium. -The field is still there... I never want to see that place again. I don't want to hear about football. SIeepy. Tim. Curly. Konsti. Andy. And Shadow. Booh! We are the Rooftop-Kids. Stop! I don't play with the Freak! Don't call me "Freak" , you D?ner! Whom do you call "D?ner"? - Well, you! Have some problems, Freak? Oh, oh, shit's steaming! Lalalalala! Lalala! Well, you little mutts, are you just barking or do you really bite? This is about soccer. If you want to prove something, do it! Come on! We have to play as a team. Who is the enemy? The Welthunger? He means Mark and the VfB. Bingo! - Let's beat Mark and his companions! We are bigger, we are schigger, check this, Digger, Teufelskigger! Shut up! Are you coming? What's up? - Nothing. But why it's always against Mark? Can't we just play soccer? Ahr. Is she in a crush on him, or what? - Ahr... - - Hey, that's unfair. I'm home! Yes, but my time is running out. I want to start building the hotel. Well, little one. I hope you are hungry. Great suggestion. Bring the Investors! I win the trophy and all are happy. Mark, the Carpet! Ugh! - What was the last word? Lose? Ahr! That word I don't know, Mark, sit down! Has little Catrina a small woe? You probably headed too many balls? Do you play tennis with your head? No. Mark tries to be funny again. Trinchen, we are happy cause you don't play soccer anymore. Right, Birdy? We are very happy. Exactly. Leave playing soccer to the right guys. How runs the training for the Cup? - Good. We wipe the floor with the competitors. That's exactly I want to hear.. We play two qualifying games, to get into the tournament. What the heck! - So what? The first game is against the reigning champions. Mark and the VfB? We are delivered. - Not if we train enough. Go! Yes! SIeepy, wake up! Good morning. Are you crazy? Don't you have eyes? Go for it! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Catrina, here! What's your problem? - Stop to command me! Rather me than you. You only yammer around. - Just ask me why! Why should I? Play soccer but with your great friend Mark! What? What did you just say? You always pull faces when one drivels about Mark and the VfB. How stupid do you think I am? - Man, you idiot! Stop it! Go apart! Fucking shit, man! Tear them apart! Shit! -Oh crap! More speed! Hey, that's my money! - No, it's mine! Two? Why two? I am a keeper, I am the One! That looks as if my dog shit on it. Always only grumble, grumble, grumble! Oops! Where the hell is Catrina? Has anyone seen Catrina? As soon as your coach is, you go. - Coach? My game, my rules. - Is sick. No coach, no game. Then I have to judge the game unfortunately for lost. Wait a minute. Mama! Will you do me a huge favor? I just can try. Two minutes. - He's coming. Mhm. Papa, this is nonsense. They don't even wear proper jerseys. Patience, Junior. Let them play. Next time they wear proper jerseys. If there is a next time. Well, have you brought your reinforcement? Thank you for coming. - Aren't you too old for this? A kind of talisman. Thank you. - Okay. Wait a minute. I have to show you something. Follow me. - This is Enes. Babble with him! - - What? Stop picking your nose. Hey! Don't talk to him! He has Enes, a kind of Turkish flu. Extremely contagious. I'm vaccinated. I can mediate, if something's on. There is a problem. I see only ten players. I have to... - Catrina! Oh, Catrinchen, well? - My name is Catrina, Want to see how Papa rubs of the competitors? Not quite. But... Is he your father? Stepfather. But then Mark is your ... - You're a real genius. Nice eye! So have you. Come here! Shit! - Hey, go on! Oh Man! - Yeah! Do not fall asleep! - What is this? Quickly, cover him! -Yes! I'm free! - Ahr! Yes! Oh Man! Try going right on it! - Ahr man! Quickly! The ball! - I'll get him, yes. - I would have got him. But you haven't. - Man, you idiots! Had it to be? It's just a game. Your team will never reach the final. - What? My team? Exactly, to call this muck a team, insults the kind of sport. But I'll get you tickets for the final. These VfB-types are the real horror. I think yes, these are Borgs. Ugly Borgs. Shut up, Enes! We are just ordinary shit. No, we are mega-shit! You need to know. I'm talking about myself too, you Freak! - Who was stupid hanging around the Not me. 12:0! - Keep your mouth shut for a while. What? You super-center forward, how many goals have you scored? None at all! If the others are too stupid to centre wise! Shut your mouth! That's exactly they want to, breaking us apart. Let you do that to you? - We still have another qualifying match. We can not be worse anymore. -Yeah. Super. Oh my God! No! - No! No! Stop! Stop! Hey! Stop it! Stop! Stop, hey! Oh, there you both are. I had a job interview. And I do not exaggerate but it is pretty well gone. Hm. Have I missed something? Janina, I hope you get the job. You really deserve it. Thanks, you're kind. It aint easy to scratch a living in this flea-pit. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. My opinion. My Mom is totally crazy since my Dad's gone away. She married this idiot. We live with him. Filled up the horror. Your Mom married, and you get the Psycho-bro and the psycho-dad. Could happen to you too. Worse than Niko's laughter. I thought, you're funny to me, because you don't like me. Why shouldn't I like you? - No idea. Because you like to be your own boss. Here comes the super talented boy, who just lost the game by 12:0. you lost? We are eleven. Not anymore, We don't even have a field. Papa, are you going to work? Wait a second. Huh? I don't check anything more. - Are we going shopping, or what? Are you crazy or what? Calm down! Grampa thinks he has displaced the spare card. Do you think... - Cool! Cool thing! - - I don't believe it! Moritz, we can not train here! Is like the playing fields with covered lawn. Only without grass. And without a field! It's cool! Has potential. - But hello! Let's go! Wow!- Boah! Alex, here! And back again! Once again! Here! Niko, come here! Come on! Yeah! - Uh, I slipped. You even kept the Ball. Sure! Uh! Lies down with a nose-dive. - What's so funny? Your pass wasn't bad, girl. But Maurice wasn't found on this planet. We have just... - I know what you did. Registering me as a coach and do a lousy job. Then you steal my chipcard and break in here. I'm sorry. - I hope so! Talented team and what's the use? Nothing! Huh? - You there, Tokio Hotel! What are you doing in the backfield? With your shot you belong to the forwards! That goes for you too, Steffi. Yes, you! How many girls do you see here? I don't count Tokio with them. Although, who knows. I would not laugh too soon, Sinbad! - Who? Me? Sindbad! Don't you either, L?cke! What was that action before? What? What are you doing this far out? Stay in your gate! That goes for everyone. A lot of talent but zero team spirit. That's why you have lost. Okay, when is your next game? - On Monday, Mr.... What "Mr."? Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Four more days. Huh? What are you staring at? You have me as a coach by the cheek. To work! Hop, hop! - Kitchen Department. - Huh? What? Who keeps the ball the longest, won. - You get three minutes. Got it? - - Yes! And you? I'm the Manager. - Hm. Oh. My Ball! Go on! - Pass over, Catrina! So play! Oh, oh. Has anyone inserted a night shift ? - Me? I studied all night long, Mrs. Pirosky. Good. But use some free time to play as well. Books are not everything in life. Many thanks, Mrs. Pirosky. I'll remember that.. Yes. Pooh! Next, the Caution-Glass Department to practice dribbling. Ow! Again! Ow! - Go! Hit! - One moment. Hehehe! Don't touch my hair! Well, that works! And nothing that is broken. Yeah! We are bigger, we are schigger, check this, Digger, Teufels... Hm. Oops! Chee ho! Chee ho! Chee ho! Good Night, Mo... oh! - What? Hm? Nothing, nothing. I wanted to say good night and good luck for the game. Sleep well! Gents, that's it for now. All or nothing. If we win, we are in the tournament. Otherwise, we can pack. I could give a motivational speech, but you won't listen anyway. Don't pick your nose! I have thought of something. Reaches into the bag! Jerseys! - You may keep'm if you win. You have to win! Otherwise, I take'm away! - Teufelskicker! Teufelskicker! Teufelskicker! Pull out! Don't bunch up. Go on it! Don't let one pass! Keep your places! Pull out, Man! Oh. Pass! Come on, play soccer! - Play! Man! That was my ball! - I'm not a man! That was my ball! - Start crying! Yeah! Yeah! - Super! What's wrong with you, Enes? - Ahr, nothing. I feel slightly excluded. Aha. - Teufelskicker! Teufelskicker! Hey, people! Enes feels slightly excluded. - What? Stop! No! Help! Help! Help! Okay, gents! Time to feed the preditories. Wait a minute. Peace! Where's Enes? - Hamburger! Where is Enes? Enes?! Very good. Slowly and controlled. Once around and back. Perfect! And the finish! Here forward. Perfect! Look, take your time! Yes! Got something for you. Wow. High five! Yes! What are you staring at? Never seen a natural talent before? Wow, Enes! That was really good! - Shut up, Sinbad! Ha! Ha! I bet I'm faster than you. We shall see. See ya. Teufelskicker, hm? Cool name. You look good. I could swear you're grown. Do you play only the front or how is your system? Are you here to spy our strategy? I just want to bring you the ball. Moritz, I'm sorry. I made a huge mistake. I miss you. I miss you badly. You and your Mom. All this has nothing to do with you. Did she say something to you? Can you talk to her? If it has nothing to do with me, why don't you do it yourself? That's the problem, She doesn't talk to me. What do you mean? - I'm late for training. The way you won, were 10 percent talent and 90 percent fucking about. Moreover, the FC Wolperath is at the bottom of the league. - Let's start again at the Big Bang. - - Yes. Many fast contacts! Come, come! Ey! We want to play soccer! It's so dangerous here. Complete madness. What's here the link with soccer? Did you get it from Klinsmann? I give up. Ey! Here! Come on! Owa! Yes! That was my Ball! - It was my turn! No, I've come from behind! As I told you. Her tennis instructor says she was not with him for weeks. Sweety, I... Once and for all, young lady, soccer is not a game for girls.. And that's it.. Your father and I... - Stepfather! If you win, we're the semi-finalist against VfB. Yes! Payday, Baby. One moment! We have to win first. Play more like a team! Are you okay? Good. Now get all out. And kick them in the ass! Yes, the hell! Steffi, not so tired! Go on it! What have I taught you? Watch out! Man! - Such a waste of time! Run, run, run! You are Teufelskicker, not Siebenschl?fer! Come backward! Watch the def... Terrible. Steffi! Now come! Come, come! Yes! Come! Good. And hit that thing! Yes! Yes!- And pull! Yes! - It works! Yes, come, come on! watch out, behind you! Moritz, run free! Hey! Man! Yes! Yes! Are you actually still going to church? - No. Not since quite a while. - Why? - You should start slowly to pray. Yes! It's okay now! Rudi. None thought we would play against each other again. I'm looking forward. - I've thought, you need time to prepare. I am not a monster. You can go. You are fired! No need to fire me, you headcheese! You may push te job somewhere else! "You should start slowly to pray." It was so cool. Moritz. Papa? - Yes. No training. Save your efforts. The day after tomorrow i'ts serious. The winner will play against Hulstorf. Hulstorf? Against Holger? I just can't wait. Yes, I'ld like to watch that game. - Thanks. Was there mail on your application? - No.. The response from the 5-star restaurant is still missing. Otherwise, only I don't fit anywhere. - It's in the family. Well, great. Well, well, well, the Teufelspickles with their soccer-Barbie. Steal away, Mark. Hua! Give it back! You want the ball? How was it: If we take it off you and keep it for five minutes, it belongs to us. If not, it's yours. Grab it! - Catrina! Go, go! Woah! Ow! Ahr! - Hey, Shadow! Here! Run, Alex! The children! No power on earth can stop us now. To the people it is diabolic. We are here to save the world. Catrina stands free! - Catrina! Catrina! Here! Hey, dammit! What is it now? - Alex! Play now! Alex! Woah! I would say, I reserve the thing. - At last! - I said so. Terrilbe! - Oh, shit! Come on, quick! Goes a Niko around the corner.What's missing? The tooth! - Ha! Ha! Ha! Hey, Alex. You haven't told a joke yet. Yes, you never tell jokes. I bet you don't know one. Okay, okay. Getting three Turks on a bus ... - Hey, No Turks jokes! The way you've beaten Mark, that was the hammer. I've misunderstood you. You are the coolest guy at school. So why have you shot your bro? Wait, Alex! Come back! Deli misin?- Ben ?yle demek istemedim. I expressed myself wrong. - Idiot! Who has defeated who? Shut up! You don't need to show up tomorrow! - Stupid cow. VfB rather screws it ! You lose! Get Papa on the phone! Papa! Okay, you get out and you upstairs! Get me Papa! Papa, yes? Yes, exactly. Rothkirch from VfB, Yes! Something wrong? - Super funny question! Uh, no, my wife. Huh, You're the referee tomorrow, right? Yes. Yes. I heard you didn't get the loan for your little house. Yes, one has to hear so many. Yes. No, no, for God's sake. But I got an idea, to solve your problems and some of mine. Yes, I think, we'll come together. My mother brought again my father on bail from jail. I was alone with Tommy, my little brother. The problem was that we had a game, and that Tommy always running with the ball has hurt himself. I missed already some games because of my dad. Rothkirch said if I was missing again, I would be suspended. So I took a risk. Man, I was only two hours off. I locked him up and said that I'ld be back again soon. That he shouldn't play with dangerous things. I even have hidden the whole cutlery set, because of the wall plugs. He had a small fork with a panda on it. He always played with that. The game was great. I scored the winning goal and everything... But as I came home... There were police everywhere. I did not understand at once, what happened. Then I saw the ambulance and heard my mother scream. He was the best friend I had. And I left him alone. It wasn't your fault. Leave me alone, please! Alex gave up? But just today... What's wrong? I said, Keep the ball low! - Are you all nuts?! Such a stupid action! Sorry. It won't help you now.. - We beat them. Great, then we go straight to the final! We wanna beat'm in the tournament, Yep. Is it right? Yes, the hell. - I don't hear anything! Yes, the hell! - Much better. You'll play like men, included Steffi! My name is Catrina. I don't care, we also win without Tokyo. Get out! Kick them in the ass! Yes, the hell! Why are you grinning? - Uh nothing, coach. Okay, Put this on! You're in. Really? No, it's just a joke. Come on, move your little ass! Hop! Guys, no need to tell you, how important this game is. Yesterday you can check off. Only this game counts. Mr. mayor! Hi. Today we have the home advantage. And they have lost their best player. So, there are nomore obstacles. Get out and knock'm out! Go! Come all to me! Come to me! Come! Well, Boys. No mercy! And... Fair Play! More aggressive! Beat them! The way you play I don't even spend holidays. L?cke, Watch out! L?cke! Show off! You're playing in a team! Yes, beat them! - Ahr! Foul! - Have you ever lead a game? Ahr! - Do you have tomatos on your eyes? - Worse than a mole! - - Niko, come! - All reposition! Come on! - - , There's a free! Nice ball! Again! - You blind fish, you! Look out! Damn! - Shit! Yes! Look to the right and left! Give a pass! - Here! Here, Catrina! Offer help! Where do you stand? Mark, keep your nerves! - Get 'm, Get 'm! Very nice! Now go on! Go! O God! Come on, Moritz! Here! - Pass forward! Build a wall! Look out! - Give a pass! Don't let him go! To Steffi! - I am free! - Give a pass! O man! No! Ahr, man! What a missed chance! What was that? I stood free! And I thought, you'ld have changed . - Yes! We won! Yes! VfB! We really hurt you! - I would say we keep the thing. Tomorrow I can bring your greetings to your old Club. Ha! We really hurt you! VfB! Moritz, you have a shit played together. Were you in the same team as we? How can you bring us that shit? Unnecessary action. - Then run away, you crybabies! You don't need to say that twice! - I don't need you! Let's get lost. The loser may think what he likes to. Little one, I had no idea how much talent you have. By the gusts of wind he flies high. Chop! And chop and chop! Mayor, did you call the police? We celebrate quite harmless. We still miss the fire brigade ! You've brought your sister? How charming! I go into the cellar to get some wine. - Mhm. It was a super game. Yes. The others were not good. - Well. Did you see the mayor? I'll feed him drunk. Honey, I'ld like tot discuss something with you. I maybe have an idea. You want to add Catrina to your team? I beg you pardon? Now she is out of the tournament she could... Birdy, do me a favor, okay? Thinking is not your strength. So let it be. Somehow is a '62 Chateau Lafite too bad for a party. She was so good today. I am very proud of her. For good reason. You are her mother and you have no idea about soccer. But at least you could... - Birdy! You had a stupid idea, we talked, that's it! Bring this in the basement. Friends! Supplies! The same again. If you still want to drink, Rudi, I want your car keys. I sold the Ford. How else gets a loser to the dough? Fill it up. Hi, my dear. Well? How was it? Have you seen Rudy? Is something wrong? My life is fucked! Because of you! Why had Papa to kiss this bitch? What? - You've chased him! I'm trying really hard. It's not that simple. Then try harder! For it's not enough. I hate this dump! I hate it! Do you think it was my desire? Do you think this makes me fun? because I get the rejections! Rejections on a job! From your father! You have no idea! Mama... - Go to your room! Janina? Janina, are you there? I've seen your car. I got to tell you something, personally. Two things actually. You know that Moritz's team lost. But there was an anonymous call. Apparently, Rothkirch has bribed the referee. Do you understand? VfB was deprived of victory. So Moritz won. I am so proud of our son. The Teufelskicker will play the final against the SV tomorrow. Yes! I'm not so good with feelings. But more than anything else in the World I want you back. All of us! You promised, you come to a soccer game. From the beginning to the end. If you like to start over with me, so come tomorrow. Please! If you come, that's my second chance. If not, then there is no future for us and I apply for divorce. - Get a divorce! - - Give him a chance! If my old woman never goes to see a game, I want a divorce as well. You said anything, Klaus? - No, my treasure. You should listen to me. If you don't show me that we are a family, We get a divorce. And I will take my 50 percent.. What are you doing? - Have you heard? Sure! My stepfather firmly rolls the wheel! Then let's go! We drum up the team. - We? I know, I've screwed all up. I'm sorry. But we are a team and I bend it straight again. Okay, wait. Rapunzel, Rapunzel, in your place I would stay in the tower. Should I ask dad where you go at night? You wouldn't tell him. - You sure? And you, my little funny dude. Hard to believe that you come without a bodyguard. My nose cast is off. It's your turn. Let's go! Come on trash, strike! Yes, come on! Mark, stop it! - Now I am Jacky Chan. "Kung-Fu clears the stomach". Ah! Mark! Come on. Come on, strike. Or is your laughter gone? Drop it! You can not beat me. 10 years karate. I am unbeatable. Eh! Ow! My nose! - That was Bruce Lee, "Shit, nose plaster again. Eh! Come quickly! - Owa! I don't need a taxi. - Wait! What are you idiots doing here? It is... Enes, what time is it? - Two P.M. I hope you have a good reason! - Better than good. Are you still very tight, or what? - Yo, man! Bock to Final Victory! Hey, what's going on? Shit! Hey, you guys! Wait! Beh! I'm sorry. Huh? Oh no, you brought the whole cavalry. Don't whine! You wetten me. What are you loser doing here? We are no loser anymore. - That's beyond me. Rothkirch bribed the referee. Hm? The VfB is disqualified. We are back. - I understand, "We are back." We play against Hulstorf. - Owa! Within four hours. - No, now... No. I'll go with you. Holger will pass through it. Ouch! - You let it be! I need to. I am their coach! - Rudi's right. Without our coach We will be disqualified. Wise little guy. He inherited from us. Moritz, Grandpa's health is more important than a soccer game, right? You should briefly think about it. Very briefly. - This boy comes across me. But he is right. That I have to lie is a problem. - Or maybe not. - Huh? I got an idea. And higher the legs! That's right. You're doing it well. Go ahead! I'll be right back. What's up? Today is the time. I'm so animal nervous. - Sure! This is the final! Flo, it's not only about the final. Playing against the son, there's the feelings you get. I'm talking about Janina! I see. Sure, that costs a pain as well. Today decides our future. If she's not on the bus eveything's over and out. What will you do? Come to Flo. Oldy, that's what you need now. That's therapy. You don't know how well feeling this will be. Come on. You see! - I feel somewhat uncomfortable. Relax. You're so tense. Mmh! Quite strange. As we are standing here, it's like time stands still. Mhm, yeah. The two of us confused souls in this crazy, uncertain world... Flo... - Like two stars that collide. Two lemmings running up to the abyss. Two mountain lions, sharing a goat in the moonlight. Flo... Can you relaese me? Thank you. That uh, has done well. You see! Ey, perfect! Yes! - Look at that lawn! Hammer! Full big! Bwah! Hi, Moritz. - Hi, Papa. We make it! - With Moritz, Janina, I'm so glad I've been waiting for this moment. I was an idiot. This will never come again between us. This thing has opened my eyes. You and Moritz, you are my life. I will never, never let you down again. Where is Rudi? In the hospital. Who is then the coach? Standing in front of you. Your bench is on the other side, right? The game's about to start and my team is extremely motivated, All the best! May the best team win! Eh... Alex. - I wanted to get my jersey. This one? Yes! Come! Beat them, Boy! Okay, watch and listen! I just say it once. Enes, stop picking! You've earned it, losing against the VfB. They played as a team. Each of them has played you out. Now don't blow your second chance! Tokio, nice, to have you here. Take your best shot! You are probably our best player. Make it really rip, okay? Steffi, dont let walk over you! You have a shot that most of the boys are dreaming of. Sindbad, watch more the ball than the landscape! Hit! - L?cke, hair off your face! Then you might see the ball. Now to Moritz. Here's your medicin. - I don't want the medicin! Later on! I'm calling! I have to coach a soccer team! Get out! And shut the door! Outside! Moritz, look! We never had a captain. We change that now. Moritz, I want you to lead your team to victory. I know, you can do it. Okay, Teufelskicker! You all know, what to do! On three. One, two, three! Yes, the hell! Janina, I give you the instructions and you pass them on.. Eh, yes. - Eh! Ow! Shit! Game on! Super! Run you free! Nice, Shadow! Man! - This should score, Moritz! Man! No, come, here! Come! No! Janina? -Yes. They must look out. Backline clo What? Close down! - It cracks in the connection. They should close down the back! Okay, Boys! Close your backsides! - Huh? No, damn it! I meant ... set up a defensive line! And now march! Pull off! Pull off! Yes! Man! What's going on? I think they have shot a goal. The others. Well done, Felix! Good! man,soccer is not hard! Attack and defense. Defense. It's like... like... like cooking!

Janina, what 's going on just now? - They have scored a goal. Huh! We still have a half-time it's up to you, Janina. Guys, come to me! Okay. I know you have the taste of defeat on your tongues. But we have a new strategy. Apricot cake! Huh? - Is this a cooking show? Our cake needs a thinner layer. - Huh? With three eggs instead of four. Sure! The defense of four - Convert to triple chain. I see! -Ah! Well, sure. We decorate the whole thing with three fine apricot slices. Three strikers in forward. Yes, that's how we do it.! Now I got it! - Eh! Okay! Really good. And in the center we make a Layer mousse ? l'Abricot. Don't worry, I'll translate. - Go! Catch the cow and milk her! Andy, SIeepy, Konsti in the back! Catrina, Alex to me. As in the training! Attack! - Konsti! Look out! - Attack! Nice! Moritz! Yes! -Yes! Yes! Haha! Wow! Yeah! Janina, what happens? Goal. - No! For us! Yeah! Ha! Look out... What now? - We must confuse the enemy.

Take'm away! - Moritz, here! Play forward! Wow. To me! Shadow plays at Moritz. The last chance! Catrina follws! Moritz is half right! Come on, Moritz! Catrina stands free! Podolski is there.

Take your paws off me! - There! - - Come on now! Oh, I remember a joke; Getting three Turks on a bus... Hey! Keine T?rkenwitze! - But it's not about you. It's really funny. You really must hear it.. Check, check. One, two. Check. Hey, Flo. Uh, the trophy goes to the visiting team, the Teufelskicker! Teufelskicker! Teufelskicker! Teufelskicker! Yeah! We are bigger, we are schigger, check this, Digger, Teufelskigger! Teufelskicker! We are the best! Hey, Moritz. Come with me. Oldy. You've kicked really cool, man. Thank you. You were not bad either. Are we friends again? - Anyway! I didn't know, to whom I should be. - Yes. Yes, I've noticed. Fantastic game! Congratulations, coach. I also thought about things. You're not the only one who should apologize. Does that mean you give us a chance? Yes? I congratulate, Moritz. See you soon. Yep. Moritz. - Papa. This was a great game. You've played together as a team. You stopped dreaming. - Since a long time. Very great. I'm proud of you. You're a great boy. See you later. What are you doing? - Nothing. I wanted to thank you. That was really sweet of you. - We are a good team. And it's not over yet. Only when the referee blows the whistle. Ah! Diabolic! Diabolic! Hey, don't let tell you anything, all say you'll miss the goal. They say you do not need it try these steps are even far too high. And you run, you run into the current and not looking back. Each step in the floodlights as a volcano that erupts. No power on earth can stop us now. To the people it is diabolic. We are here to save this world. To the people it is diabolic. Hey, super game! Yes, I kicked them strongly in the ass. Well done! - I know. - We managers are often underestimated. That doesn't sound good. Try going to the doctor! Really. A Turkish flu is reigning since a while, it's called: "Enes". See you around. Huh? The last hour has struck For anyone who does not believe in us, And everyone who says something else, Fall in slow motion in the dust. Above us some vultures circling, The wind whistles softly our song, This is like in the Wild West It's all about who's aiming faster And that day is really history. A day you never will forget. It's about everything or nothing But you shoot faster than the light, because this is a day for winners We do not even bat an eyelash If you shoot in our direction Just hot air and nothing behind it "Rest in peace." Suddenly, dead silence surrounds us Then bells chime to a duel A showdown like in the Wild West One will stand, the other falls And that day is really history. A day you never will forget. It's about everything or nothing But you shoot faster than the light, because this is a day for winners And that day is really history A day you never will forget. It's about everything or nothing But you shoot faster than the light, because this is a day of winners And this day is really history A day you never will forget. It's about everything or nothing But you shoot faster than the light, because this is a day of winners And this day is really history A day you never will forget It's about everything or nothing But you shoot faster than the light, because this is a day of winners Because it's eternity for you.
