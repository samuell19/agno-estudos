EARTH ENTRANCED Eldorado Country in the Atlantic Alecrim Province, Governor Vieira's Palace Calm down! Any news? The President demands your resignation in five hours. Anything else? Federal troops are going to Alecrim. I don't want any bloodshed. Now we have to go to the end. The blood of the people is sacred! Blood isn't important. It'll be the beginning of our history. If we fail, Diaz will rise to power. It's useless, we'll be crushed. You cannot betray! We... Our adventure is over. Adventure? You call our work adventure? Adventure... adventure. You call it "adventure"? Adventure! Sara! Write down what I say. Obey my orders! Disperse any resistance! The contradiction that rules our lives has brought us to this political stalemate, so familiar to those who are engaged in great decisions. What is this document for? It's about economic and social development. Thus, our fate is sealed, at the head of great national decisions... Speeches, principles, promises... We hand our government over to the Supreme Federal Power. We're sure that any resistance would provoke a civil war among innocents. Who are the innocents? I devote my path to God. And I hope God, once again, blesses us with divine grace, filling our hearts with love and union. Do you see, Sara? Who was our leader? Our great leader?! I used to say he was weak. The time had not arrived. The struggle would prove much! People would die. Blood, Paulo! History isn't changed by tears. If they take up arms, if they do! Even people like you, people like us, bourgeois, weak... But I accept the risk. Stop, Paulo, your madness... My madness is my conscience, now, in the hour of truth! Time for decision! Even in the face of death! We don't need any heroes. We might resist, I need to sing. I need to sing! No more condecorations... This joyful pomp of glories... This golden hope on the Plateau. No more this regal parade... With war and Christ, side by side! No more the naivet? of faith. The impotence of faith... "I was not able to ratify the treaty between the bloody cosmos and the pure soul. A gladiator defunct, but intact (so much violence, yet so much tenderness) Mario Faustino I'm dying now, at this time. My blood and tears are shedding. Oh, Sara! They'll say I'm crazy, a romantic, an anarchist, as ever... I don't know, oh Sara... Where I was 2,3,4 years ago? Sailing with Dom Porf?rio Diaz. The god of my youth, Dom Porf?rio Diaz. What I cannot explain to my enemies are my reasons for abandoning the pleasures of solitude, for the priesthood of public life. But neither could Christ explain, but by offering His own life. And so, I'd reply to my enemies that Christ gave His life for the people when the exploiters wanted Him to join exploitation itself. He died, but didn't betray! Nor will I, by proclaiming the greatness of man, of Nature, of God! There he was, dancing with Silvia, what a happy day! He was overwhelmingly elected Senator. Such a happy day! He was alone with Silvia and I, at home. I was always following him, almost lost, in those useless, empty days in Eldorado. A hell called Eldorado! Frustrating, stealing my youth. I've been following Diaz for years. And that night he came to me so loving and tender... Our poet will be elected deputy soon. To Silvia, who will be Mrs. Paulo Martins. Aren't you happy? It's not that. You know about my friendship and admiration. But, starting with your help, when I could do it on my own... Don't you want to be Dom Diaz's prot?g?? Pride? I don't know, but, it's my poetry... I myself, a new poetry... If I could write about serious things, if I could talk about... political ideas? We're radical and extremist when young... I've been thinking... We don't have to meet again. You and your friends... You and Alvaro! It was my decision. What can I do about Silvia? I don't know, I don't care. At least allow me this. Let me choose my own path. I've never been wrong, Silvia. Never! Some day, one fine day... Good night. Excuse me. I see fields of agony, I sail seas of denial... On my sword, I bring remnants of passion, born in those wars, some more, some less, cloistered witnesses of the blood that sustains us. Death growing, flowing and devouring. We live with death. Inside us, death becomes the failure of our daily employment, as we advance, we retreat. "AURORA LIVRE" - AN INDEPENDENT, NEWS-PACKED NEWSPAPER Look! I see. Children without schools, overcrowded hospitals. Look at this one. A campaign must be undertaken. Oh, my God, look! The donations aren't enough. Something must be done. We need a political leader, that's it. "For the poor all that is offered are scraps of fortune. Because no one will take a stand to defend his kind. The orphan must have a home, school, church and rights". Mart?n Fierro. Someone like you could never work for Diaz... I owe him a lot, you know... Reading your article, I never thought you could be so funny. Funny, me? I am tragic! Sara also came to light Alecrim. Really? She's an efficient teacher. You're lucky to be with her. I really liked your last book. Youngster things... Politics. I'd like to get involved to politics. Really. It's a tough career. I came from the bottom, with my own hands. Sara knows my struggle. I started as a simple town councillor. I had to confront cynicism, corruption. Always the most noble causes, which are the hardest. Mr. Vieira, I think you're an excellent candidate. Fine! I offer you my humble services. He's formidable. To Vieira. The country needs poets. The good ones, the revolutionaries, like the old romantics... Voices that stirred the crowds. The streets belong to the people, like the sky belongs to the condors. We'll hold big rallies throughout Alecrim. Magnificent! Better days to the poor and new life for all my people! So... It'll be like this... Yes... Viva... My dear, speak, don't be afraid. How lovely they are, Your Grace. Write it down. Take note of everything! Take note. All for you, my dear... Don't worry. It's going to be all right. Don't worry, go! Vieira, Vieira, Vieira... Quite! Quite! Mr. Governor... Say, son... In the name of these people, I'd like to ask your attention... Water here, to wet our lands Now, if you would, you could... you can, but... My son, we're going to stop these abuses. Write down, Marinho. He's writing down, you see? Write down. Isn't it, Your Grace? I'd like to say one more thing. Say it... Say. How is it? Attention! My main objective is to do peaceful work, through free elections, we'll lead to power the legitimate representatives of the people! These representatives are those who will fight for the very needs of the people! Food, school! Vieira, Vieira, Vieira... And we won! What I saw in that campaign... A tragedy, bigger than our strength. There, on that calm veranda where we've planned our struggle joyously, and then, at your side, I thought about possible problems and asked myself, "How could an elected Governor answer to the candidate's promises?" Mainly, I asked myself and the others, "How could we react to that?" 'Cause our families arrived in these lands, over 2o years ago. And we worked the land, we planted them and our wives gave birth in these lands. Now we can't leave just because some "men" appeared from nowhere showing papers and saying they're the owners. That's what I wanted to tell you, Sir. We trust you, but... if Justice says we have to leave the land, we'll die, but we won't! Be quiet, Felicio, show some respect for the Governor. Mr. Paulo, Mr. Paulo... We must shout! How? With whatever we have, bones, everything! Shut up! You know nothing! Mr. Paulo, you used to be my friend, - you used to promise... - I never did! I'm not a liar! You wretch! Weak chatterbox! Coward! Mr. Paulo, don't say that, Mr. Paulo... Don't say that, Mr. Paulo, don't. Mr. Paulo, don't say that... Do you see? You're worth nothing! Mr. Paulo, you were my friend! I went there. I beat a poor peasant because he threatened me... He could have cut my head off with a hoe, but he was so cowardly and servile! And I wanted to show he was a coward and servile. Weakness! Weak people! Always feeble and terrified! Blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, The Lord is with thee, blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace The Lord is with thee, blessed are thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners... I used to tell him not to get involved, I think it was a disgrace. We were walking that night, he walked forward and turned another way, and as he opened the gate, I heard a shot, a scream, a light! My husband... It was Vieira, he is the murderer. He promised and didn't keep his word. This bastard has betrayed our people. The murderer works for the Government. He works for the Government. Vieira is guilty for everything. Murderer! He is the murderer. The people are in the streets. I await orders. Don't disperse. Everybody has the right to protest. I advise you to arrest Colonel Moreira. Is there any evidence against him? The widow's testimony. And, it's not the first time, we've known it. It has to be done! We have to choose between electorate and commitments. I can't arrest him. I must warn you, it'll have negative repercussions for you in the Federal Government. Where is Paulo? Break off! Let the boat go! But first I have to fire those aides you suggested me... Professionals of disorder... A man has been killed. The family, everybody, wants justice! Politics requires ability. I am the Governor! The elected one! Moreira and the other farmers financed a great part of my campaign. And I? And Sara? And the students? What about the support of the people? They knew about the commitments... But I have my own commitments, to myself. I can't accept such a huge lie. I'm not your government's police to use force to solve the conflicts you should confront! The streets belong to the people like the sky belongs to the condors. The brave poet of the slaves used to say. If we arrange it all, I might get more money for schools. Funds? Money to be stolen by your fiends. Funds. Charity only postpones or worsens poverty. It's very easy to be reasonable when you are on top. A leader must take a moral stand! Arrest Moreira! Maybe you're right, but that's impossible. So, tell me your plan? How is it? Waiting would help... And now? What to do? Police oppression. So, I quit! One day, when it'll be impossible you'll be devoured by the hungry, then we'll see that the lack of courage, the indecision... And who are you, Vieira? Tell me, a leader? If you don't have the abilities, you should never have gone to the rallies. Never! Disperse the riot! Do it! When the woman was crying in front of me, you know who's the killer? It's your fault, Mr. Paulo, you're the one to blame! We have to protest in the streets. Who did it must pay! And it was Governor Vieira. Something must be done. We have to fight, he has to die. Someone must pay for it. But I refuse the certainty, the logic, the balance... I prefer Porfirio Diaz insanity... So easy, like this. Easy? Put an end to it all? Sacrifice deepest ambitions. What do you know about ambition? I wanted to marry, have children, like any other woman. But I was thrown into the heart of my time. I was raised in the streets my first banner. And they shot us. Friends died and they arrested me. And sent me to a filthy jail, with rats, and tortured me with electric shocks. They raped me, and, set me free with the scars. And I continued the struggle, raising banners, never for pride. It was a greater thing, in the name of logic of feelings! And if it's an ordinary woman's ambition, what's the other ambition but happiness? Solidary and happy people. The hunger of the absolute... Hunger. I'm hungry. Come with me, Sara. Don't behave as a fanatic, waiting for things that never happen until we're finished. Come with me! Life is bigger than the time we live in. Life is an adventure! You don't understand. A man can't be divided this way... Politics and poetry are too much for only one man... I'd love you to stay with us. Return to writing. I do not announce songs of peace... Neither do I care for the flowers of style. Bad news everyday that defines the world I live in. Sara... Sunsets do not make me feel the pain of adolescence. I give back to the landscape, the vomits of experience. Poetry is senseless... Words... Words are useless... When I came back to Eldorado, I don't know when... When I saw once again the same landscape, nature, the same people lost in its impossible splendour. I brought the sadness from lost encounters and once again, I got lost in the depths of my senses. I didn't believe in dreams, in anything. Only my flesh could burn and there I could find myself. I, Julio Fuentes, declare a permanent state of joy in Eldorado and I greet Paulo Martins, poet and patriot. Get up, worm! Go on! Here is the very image of a ruined man. A mistake. Take it, genius, prop up this ruin! Go. Paulo, my friend... Silvia, your man is back. Paulo, my friend, he's back. Don't touch my wife! Leave her, you scum! Leave my wife! Take it! We live with worms... But it's dangerous, they can devour our intestines. The people. They should invade the palaces! The people, Paulo! The guerrillas! The guerrillas! When beauty is overtaken by reality, when we lose our purity in these gardens of tropical diseases when with anaemic people we breathe the same air of the worms in the animals' pores, or when we flee from the streets and inside our homes poverty follows us in it's most lethal forms, like food, books, records, clothes, plates, skin, your liver bursts in rage, your throat panics and an inexplicable oblivion of ourselves. Finally we feel that death converges, into an aggressive form of life. Wild sea that involves me in this sweet continent... On this forgetfulness I bestow my sad Latin voice, sadder than revolt, and more... I vomit in the streets the acid dollar, marching amongst dirty children, with their blind birds' eyes. I see the Atlantic dawn with blood, under a constant metal jet threat. War and wars in foreign countries. I can say, an astronaut was fulfilled on the moon. Any joke is possible in everyday tragedy. I, for example, I do the vain exercise of poetry. I know you don't want weapons not, as well... not to ask for more that I came to you. I agree, it's the best way. There was a time and time ends. But see, you're not gone yet, you're anywhere I breathe Or I see, I dream, or I dream about the mutation of things. Tell about you about us, without us. You've forgotten to take yourself... It was Vieira who asked to see you and explain that he can't do all by himself. I know, I'm worth nothing... Oh! My beloved... He's been tortured! Tortured... Paulo, the worse things has happen to you... Worst than anything you saw in Alecrim. I've been writing about the misery of our souls... You're a kind of anarchist, but you can be useful. So, please, don't be so kind. Let me ask you something, What was your deal with Vieira? To change Eldorado. Do the opposite of Diaz... And what Diaz wanted? To be preserved, as a mummy... Why did you leave Vieira? Because he doesn't yet have... You know... Vieira also didn't want a change. Vieira is, at best, paternalist... I don't care about his personal qualities... His qualities... Historical? Historical! So, historically Vieira can save Eldorado from underdevelopment... from the International Extraction Company's colonisation... EXPLINT! Do they allow it? Do you think Explint will let you go on? Enough theories! Explint supports Diaz. But if Diaz get weakened... Diaz weakened... Diaz weakened... Diaz... If you destroy Diaz Using Julio Fuentes's press. You know everything about Diaz... I, betray Diaz for... You know you can't ask that of me. You have a commitment! I have commitments? Which ones? I've never assumed any... You know better than I. You know we all have commitments... You know and you write about it. With time... Before, I wanted to change... And if we do? Change what for? Go where? With what weapons? My inspiration came from the punished flesh, from these travelled eyes. In this oblivion, horizons searched by other poets... I imported the best equipment... Look! I was born there. I'll do great campaigns... Even confront Diaz... Diaz will have a new network. With whose money? Our senator is a man with no material ambition. Sometime I think he is a kind of saint, genius, martyr... Some day he will hurt you. Never... Actually, I had dinner with Mr. Cassius at the Embassy... He visits his friend everyday. They talk about tropical plants. I've imported some seeds. Marvellous! I gave them to Fernandez, for the palace's gardens. I've got new funds from the National Bank. Fernandez wants to appoint Silvia to be our Ambassadress of beauty in... Do you know Vieira? - Vieira? - He's much more serious. Vieira? Vieira is a provincial, a demagogo. - Besides, I told the truth. - He'd show out the farce. What a farce? Is there any other solution for the country? Which one? Mr. Cassius is travelling? He didn't sign the new contracts?! It's absurd! Absurd! They cancelled the advertisement contracts. What's the use of working? I want to develop this little country, I promote the arts, I perform acts of charity, I do useful things! Paulo, Paulo warned you. Shut up! What you know about business? I have the right cards. And when one loses the game? Lose the game? How? It's dangerous to face strong enemies. I'm able to face any domestic or foreign company. Can you confront Explint? I ask, if they can confront me! They are already doing it. They've begun by cancelling the advertisements. My newspaper and my network are independent. I'll be supporting pro-nationalist policies. The Fuentes Empire, the biggest economic organisation of Eldorado! It claims to defend our wealth from Explint exploitation! But Fuentes have forgotten one thing: To do a political scheme to face Explint. And what have you done in politics? I've been supporting Fernandez. And who keeps him in the presidency. The constitution. Explint! Listen, Fuentes. Don't you read your own newspaper? I have warned you, but rich people never think that one day they'll wake up poor. I've done many favours for Fernandez. He prefers the opulent side. The sons of the Enlightened City, the civilised men. They placed him in the presidency, to protect our wealth from the exploitation you intend to defend. They're all very nice, as long as you don't threaten them. J?lio Fuentes has grown... so much... that Explint can't take him anymore. So, if Explint pushes the button, J?lio Fuentes is dead! No! No! I can't die! I'm richer than all Eldorado. I own gold, silver, uranium mines. I own the fruit fields, the petroleum reserves... the steel companies, the network... I can't, I can't die! A few days, at the height of your glory, you were the most powerful man of the world! I need you! You and everybody! I can't die! Be afraid! Suffer! Think! Explint! Diaz! Fernandez! I'll destroy them all! You'll manage the newspaper and the TV, I give you full liberty, and full power to do whatever you want. Even I couldn't say why I attacked Diaz. At that moment I'd hurt the one who had done most for me. I was starting a political adventure. I couldn't have foreseen the outcome. The only thing I knew was that I couldn't stand that life, and I had to find new ways. Anyway, even leaving them half-done, and waiting for others cleverer than I, who could reach the end... But, if I wasn't dying now, I also would reach the end. I would, because my roots aren't putrid. Only one thing I knew, Sara. I'd go for your love, Although I was far away, I loved you more than I hated Eldorado. By destroying Diaz, Sara, I was to be free to go back to you... To come back to Vieira's promises. To believe in your love for the country. You have to link Vieira to Fuentes and destroy Diaz. You're the only one who can do it. Eldorado can't wait! And you'll get nothing from it. It's just a job. Nobody will thank you. Because it's nothing, facing what you have to do. You have to, even if you don't believe in it. Even if you adore Diaz. Even if you hate Vieira. Even if you die! Even if everybody dies! "TV ELDORADO PRESENTS" THE ADVENTURES OF A FORTUNE-SEEKER A REPORT BY PAULO MARTINS And attention, Ladies and Gentlemen. See how a politician is made. See how a man, without any contact with the people, can be great and honoured, in this land, Eldorado. Here's the main headlines on Porf?rio Diaz's life. 1920. He appears as an extremist leader, promoting students' strikes. Elected to Congress. 1933. He betrays the students' movement and supports Villa Flores's dictatorship. He is appointed Secretary of the Treasury. 1937. He betrays Villa Flores and supports Pancho Morales's dictatorship. He is appointed Secretary of Culture. 1938. He betrays Pancho Morales and supports El Redentor's dictatorship. He is appointed Secretary of State. 1939. He suggests the purchase of a war arsenal from Explint. He makes one million dollars. 1941, 1946. Eldorado goes to war. 13,000 men die. Explint finances his run to the Senate. 1948, 1957. The Senate overthrows El Redentor. Diaz leads Fernandez's election. He forces Fernandez to agree with Explint's demands. So, Ladies and Gentlemen, the profile of this man, who never saw the people, plans to overthrow Fernandez and uses any possible weapon to take him to power. And for that, he will fight he will manage any policy, affirming today yesterday's lies, denying tomorrow today's truths. So, this is the face of democratic virtue. This is the father of the nation. He was dying like me. We were both suffering from it, even before he asked for me, and I went to see him. I was full of hate and remorse... I insist on it. I gave you the first opportunities. I have been betrayed by the most sordid and despiteful men! I shouldn't be betrayed by you! You! And how do you thank me? How? With gestures full of political interest. What is political interest compared to friendship? There's nothing above friendship. A friend always accepts another. Under any conditions, a friend is a friend. Have you forgotten everything? Won't you apologise? Neither a "pardon"? Won't you kiss my feet? Who can save Eldorado but me? In whose name do you act? For what? What ideas foment such hate against me? What do you want? Money? I give you all the money you want. Power? Stay with me and it will be yours. If I wanted... If I wanted now. Politics is a weapon for the elect. For the gods. The extremists have created the mystic of the people, but the people are worthless. The people are blind and vengeful. If one bothers about the people, what would they do? Where is your conscience? Not for all the gold in the world! We're rotten for our crimes. For your crimes! I've washed my hands in blood, but I've been humane! The blood of students, peasants, workers! The blood of the worms! We wash our souls. We purify the world! Our wealth, our flesh, lives, everything. You've sold everything! Our hopes, our heart, our love, everything! Everything! Last chance, say yes! An epidemic rage, Diaz! I destroy! With your fragile hands? Alone, Paulo? Alone? Alone! Paulo, alone! A candidate from the people! "A LEADER MEETS THE PEOPLE" Accept my support, Vieira. Our President wants to be a new Napoleon and Diaz a new Caesar! Only you could be a new Lincoln! Peter denied Christ three times! But it was he, who founded God's Church. And Judas, the traitor, hanged himself naked, naked! Gentlemen, we will open trails in the forests, we will found cities, where there were savage lands. Bridges over rivers, roads crossing the desert, machines ripping out minerals from the earth! What would have become of the Americas without priests? What about the Aztecs and the Mayas? What about the Tupis, Tamoios and all the Amerindians? What about the Faith? What is the meaning of coherency? They say it's wise to observe history without suffering. Until one day, by conscience, the people takes over... I walk and see these skinny, apathetic, depressed people. These people can't believe in any party. These feeble, bloodless people. These people need death above all. The blood that incites a brother to grief the feeling of nothing which leads to love. Death like faith, not like fear. Why, Paulo? Why do you wallow in this chaos? Which chaos? Look, Vieira can't speak. Nobody won't, for over a century. You've thrown Vieira into an abyss. Me? The abyss is here, wide-open. We all march towards it. But it's not the people's fault. It's not the people's fault. It's not! But they go after the first who shows them a sword or a cross. Jer?nimo is the people. Speak, Jer?nimo. Speak, Jer?nimo. Speak! Don't be afraid! Speak! You are the people. Speak. I'm a humble man, a worker. I'm the leader of my Union. I've been in the class struggle. Everything is wrong. I really don't know what to do. The country is in crisis and the best thing is to await the President's commands. Do you see what the people are like? Idiots! An illiterate! A petty politician! Can you imagine Jer?nimo in power? A moment! A moment, folks! A moment! Let me speak. I'll speak. Excuse me sirs! Jer?nimo does the people's politics, but he's not the people. The people are me. I have seven children and have nowhere to live. Extremist! Extremist! Extremist! Extremist! Extremist! Extremist... Hunger... And illiteracy... are extremist propaganda! Extremism is a virus that infects actions, infects the air, the blood, infects the water and morals... In Eldorado there is no hunger, no violence... nor poverty! Political irresponsibility... Your anarchism! Political irresponsibility... political irresponsibility... Your anarchism. Political irresponsibility. Political irresponsibility. - Political irresponsibility. - Your anarchism. - Political irresponsibility. - Your anarchism. - Political irresponsibility. - Your anarchism. - Political irresponsibility. - Your anarchism. Enough! I'm almost 5o and I haven't lost my dignity. Tell me, what you, Fuentes, and the others want? I'm not here to be a political clown. If you want power, you have to bite into the struggle. I've told you, inside the masses, there's man. The Man is hard to control... Harder than the masses. No more reactionary theories! Reactionaries? We've gone too far. Maybe now it's late to go back. I understand... The trance of the mystics. Look in our eyes, our skin. If we observe it clearly, or only through violence. Every time I fought for the underprivileged majorities, I was stupidly threatened. I stepped back many times, delaying today's problems to think of the future. But if I send the present to the future, I'll only find a future drowned in tragedies. That's why I must now face Eldorado's enemies, here and abroad. Unite the masses. Break away, once and for all. Cast off the boat! Do you know what he wanted? To use the press to support the extremists. Use Vieira for this end. And where is he now? With the President, saying Vieira leads the populace. The populace. Mr. Cassius visited me yesterday to say how disappointed he was with you. He was the one who forced the President to use freedom of the Press. But how could I know you'd surrender to Paulo Martins madness. You know, Silvia, why do they think we're irresponsible? Explint, for example, helped you to buy the equipment. Paulo guaranteed me that their competition would be disastrous. Paulo! Does he have any political coherency? And Vieira is a democrat. Democrat! He comes from the Extremist Party. You too. But I met God! I know, but the cards have been dealt. We're on opposite sides. Opposite! Bravo! Bravo! Don't use this proud language. Because you're not prouder or more impetuous than Paulo. Silence, J?lio. Silence! Then, ?lvaro came to tell about the betrayal. ?lvaro came as dead as me. He felt sick on blood. The revolutionaries... A bunch of clowns! Do you know what the result of Paulo, Vieira and the extremists' pact is? Vieira, once in power, they will eliminate you. They don't respect pacts. I am left-wing. Left what? Look, idiot... The class struggle exists. What is your class? Go on, say it! If we develop industry, create jobs, perhaps... Like starving beasts, they'll want more and more. Even your own blood. They want power. The people in power? Never! Understand? Never! For freedom, we'll die, for God, for power! How can I take power without Paulo and Fuentes's help? Without the best men? Paulo betrayed me long ago. Fuentes is reluctant to support me. How? How can I explain it to my partners? You have to explain nothing. Let's take the power in a coup. Change the game. Let's write history. But they have the guarantees. I have the guarantees! Which ones? By elections, Vieira wins. Without elections, I win, overthrowing Fernandez. Only with your ideas? With Explint's support, by using its propaganda machine. Explint will pay. Paid propaganda. Then, ?lvaro came to tell about the betrayal. ?lvaro came as dead as me. He felt sick on blood. While the mini-genius of politics was planning a revolution, Fuentes and Diaz... Fuentes and Diaz? Together with Explint to defeat you, Vieira and Fernandez. Did you see? With these blind eyes, these dumb mouths... Look, Paulo, all I can do is to advise exile. And me, working night and day, Fuentes... Your naivet?... So much work, so much effort... Actually Fuentes and Diaz want you to quit everything and go back to them. And I am dirty, the monster? I don't know, I'm not interested in your convictions. Your life interests me. What counts is that I am free! And I won't step back. Who's free? Who? Diaz. Diaz is. Your images, dreams. You're a poor copy of Diaz. No. Diaz is my enemy. He's not in my blood. It's too late! Maybe we can resist, with Vieira. He doesn't have the greatness of a leader. ?lvaro, I don't know, I don't know... Don't make me smash your face! Smash it! It's worthless. Smash it! I have no pride. No vanity. Nor ambition. Smash it! My friend... My friend? You were my friend? I was your friend... But you took advantage of my weakness and betrayed your style. React! React! React against what? Against whom? Only you can react to survive. Call Fuentes, sell your soul. For Silvia, she loves you. Beyond hate, beyond life, it's late. I'll be with Vieira until the end. I can do nothing to avoid these coming days of darkness. That's why I gave up. That's why I died! Democracy is the exercise of the will of the people. We've been elected by the people, so we're representatives of their will. It's a time of decisions. The reactionaries will eat the dust of history. Let's do our historical duty by forcing the President to exterminate Vieira and his agents all over Eldorado. I'll defend our wealth from the foreign invader! God is my emblem! Work is my flag! My destiny is happiness! My principle, purity of character! With strong arms, clean hands, conscience at peace, we will build a great nation. The nation is untouchable! The family, sacred! My hope is the sunshine... Only one force can change history and nobody will stop it. This sunshine will light our lives. Dawn follows every night. The mornings are never late! This strength, is the people. Vieira! Vieira! He is the people. He is the people! The shining mornings, alive, eternal, everlasting, unchanging, infinite! Let's divide the country. If you say so, we'll bombard Eldorado. I don't care about bloodshed... I say! The blood of the masses is sacred! It will be the beginning of our history. If we fail, Diaz will rise to power. See Sara? Who was our leader? Our great leader? Obey my command. Disperse any resistance! No more condecorations, this joyous pomp of glories. This golden hope on the Plateau. No more this regal parade with war and Christ marching side by side! No more the impotence of faith, the naivet? of faith... It's no longer possible... We are eternal sons of darkness, of inquisition and conversion! And we are forever, sons of fear, of our brother's blood! And we don't accept our violence, we don't accept our ideas, neither our barbarian hate. We don't assume our stupid and feeble past, plenty of prayers and laziness. A landscape, a sound over indolent souls... These indolent races, servile to God and the lords. A typical passive indolence of indolent people. Ah, I can't believe it's all true! How long can we stand it? How long, beyond faith and hope, can we stand it? Until when, beyond patience and love, can we stand it? Until when, oblivious to fear, beyond childhood and adolescence, can we stand it... What does your death prove? The triumph of beauty and justice! They will learn! They will! I will dominate this land. I will put these hysterical traditions in order! By force, by the "the love of force"! By hell's universal harmony, we will be a civilisation! What does your death prove? The triumph of beauty and justice!
