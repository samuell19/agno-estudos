Is Mr. Williams in? You'll have to ask his secretary. Thanks. Yes? Oh, I'd like to see Mr. Williams. What's it about, please? The incentive program. Does Mr. Williams know you? I brought him a letter of introduction last week from senator Finning. Oh, just a moment, I'll see if he's busy. Thanks. Mr. Martin? I'm sorry, Mr. Williams can't see you just now. He suggests you come back later in the afternoon. Well, thanks, I'll do that. No smoking out here. Kinda tough, isn't it? Not on me, it isn't. Bert, come in here quick. A few minutes ago, it was right here. Do you mind stepping inside for a minute? Certainly not. - Mr. Williams? - Yes. Well, I'm John Martin. Oh, senator Finning's friend. That's right. Uh, well? Mr. Martin, did you see anybody take a sketch off the table? - A sketch? - Didn't do it. - Did you take it? - Me? Oh, what for? Accidentally, maybe, or... I don't remember anybody else being near that table, Mr. Williams. Of course, people were coming in and out. What would I want it for? - I came to see Mr. Williams. - Yes, and my girl told me. Well, I'm sure Mr. Martin won't object to being searched. Well, of course not. Oh, would you like to look in here? He didn't have time to ditch it. He's been standing by the door ever since he came out. I'm sorry we've troubled you, Martin. Oh, that's perfectly all right. Well, get plant security on it. Oh, Mr. Williams, any chance of seeing you now? No, I'm sorry, I'll have to see you later. All right, thank you. I hope you gentlemen find what you're looking for. What's your name? John Martin. You're lying. We called senator Finning. The letter was forged. Who are you working for? Nobody. Read that... Out loud. Whoever with intent or reason to believe that is to be used to the injury of the United States. Louder! Procures or attempts to procure for any foreign government any document, writing, sketch, photograph, blueprint, or information relating to the national defense shall. Shall be punished by death or imprisonment for no more than 30 years. You can beat that if you talk. Roberts? He's yours. Good morning. Come in and join the rest of the masterminds. Sure, it's funny now, playing spy while uncle Sam's training you. And out in the field, operating against the japs and the Nazis. It won't be your OSS school marm waiting for you with coffee and sandwiches. Could be a firing squad. Martin, you were on the ball spotting that suggestion box. Then you got impatient and you gambled and lost. You should have waited, taken a crack at the box later. I thought I had plenty of time while the guide called plant security. All I needed was a couple of seconds. Quiet right, old boy, if the sketch had been the only thing in there. But unfortunately, it wasn't. Like most suggestion boxes, it was full of suggestions. Bernay, next time you tell the Philadelphia police you've been in town a month, don't have your pockets full of matches from New York nightclubs. Parker, when you planted this bomb at that shipyard, you unfortunately left a trail of beans behind you. Gates, next time you get into trouble, don't let your partner walk into it, too. You can't rendezvous without a pre-arranged danger signal, coat collar turned up, something like that. We're telling you chaps, there's nothing super human about being a good agent. It takes guts, intelligence, and at the end, a bit of luck. And we can't waste too much time with you. We're late 400 years. That's how long ago the other major powers started their OSS. We've only got months to build the first central intelligence agency in our history, a worldwide organization that will beat the enemy at its own game. It's not your kind of game. You don't know each other. You're here under assumed names, but you're all average, decent Americans. Americans aren't brought up to fight the way the enemy fights. We can learn to become intelligence agents and saboteurs if we have to, but we're too sentimental, too trusting, too easygoing, and what's worse, too self-centered. What's your name? Schmidt, I mean, Parker. Do you know why you slipped up there, Parker? No, sir. Because you still haven't lost your identity. In this kind of work, what you are is an individual. What you feel, what you want, it doesn't matter. Teach yourself that and we'll teach you the rest. Learn your radio, know how to work it and how to repair it. Information is useless if you can't communicate it. Get it accurate and get it through. That's the payoff. Use the camera. Valuable information is often complicated and highly technical. Don't trust your memory. It can't compete with a photograph. Learn how to trail and follow without arousing suspicion. Mark the man you're following. Pick out a set of characteristics, the color of his hair, the way he walks. You can't allow yourself to be diverted for a single moment. There are millions of guys the same size wearing the same hats, coats, and shoes. Which one is yours, Martin? Watch the little things, things that are almost second nature. Hold it, old boy. That's quite proper, but a dead giveaway anywhere else in the world. Use the fork in the left-hand. Only Americans hold it in their right. That's better. An ordinary smoking pipe? Yes, that's what it looks like. You see, OSS can't accomplish its mission with standard weapons of war. You can't fight with tanks, planes, ships, and guns. So we've created our own weapons for our own special needs. Many of them disguised as more or less common articles, like that pipe. Actually, it's a revolver. When you are being followed or pursued, always remember to leave yourself an Avenue of escape. Think your moves out in advance. Stay ahead of the game. Watch out for dead ends, don't trap yourself. Learn how to kill quickly, silently. Remember you're always on the spot. Your enemy has you at a disadvantage. Your only chance is beating him to the punch. Forget everything you've ever been told about fair play and sportsmanship. Forget everything, except that your country is fighting for its life. At ease, commander. It's here and it's a bright green light. Directive from the combined chiefs authorizing your French operations. When do I start, sir? Right now, and the job won't be finished until our armies cross the Rhine. Now, our mission is two-fold. First, to get out information. Second, to work with the French resistance people and sabotage key enemy installations. Your first assignment, to help knock out the French railway system, especially the lines that feed this area. Oh, we've done some work on it, sir, with the British. A joint plan calls for dividing the country up into strategic districts and then penetrating each district with a team of agents, people who have lived in France one time or another and speak the language fluently. We trained them especially for French operations. That's fine. Set it up as quickly as possible. If you need anything, don't hesitate to check back with me personally. Man, I don't have to tell you what a large part we can play on the success of a French campaign. Now here's a key district, one of the big railroad hubs. Is that our show or yours? Ours, and a real hotspot, too. Priority target, the Corbiel Melun tunnel. If we knock it out, we can paralyze traffic on the most important line into Normandy. We've assigned it to team applejack. What's the lineup there? Leader, Rodney Parrish, army officer world war I. Civilian occupation, sold American railroad equipment in France. Called himself gates during training. A good man, mature judgment, stability and balance. Mm-hmm, next. Philip Masson, lieutenant jg, us. Navy, civilian occupation, publicity man. That's Martin. Yes, quick witted lad. A little on the cocky side perhaps. But he'll do after he's been knocked about a bit. He'll work well with gates. Mm-hmm, balance, brains. We need a little brawn in there. Frank Schmidt, chief petty officer, us. Navy, civilian occupation, sportsman, motor boat racer. Our friend, Parker. No go, he's been assigned to the German desk. They'll try and put him through Switzerland into Germany. He's lived there. A scapegoat, eh? If he gets through, he'll lay doggo as a Rhine bargeman until we need him. Here's another muscle man for you. Bouchet, hockey player, calls himself bernay. That does it, balance, brains, and brawn, the ideal setup. Then they'll need someone to contact the French underground, someone who knows the district. How about a woman? They can go a lot of places and do a lot of things a man can't, especially in a good-sized town. Personnel in London should be able to recruit a girl for you. I'll see if they can hunt one up here first. You actually live here? - Mm-hmm. - Alone? Oh, no, with Jean-Jacques, my cat. It's been very nice meeting you, Mr. Brady. I'm so glad uncle Arthur asked you to call me, goodnight. You're not going to ask me in? It's rather late. Well, my plane doesn't leave till 3:00 am. You're not gonna turn me loose on a strange town at this hour, are you? Besides, uncle Arthur wouldn't approve of that. It would be rather dreary, wouldn't it? I knew you wouldn't let me down. Thank you. That's Jean-Jacques now. He's furious because it's way past his midnight supper. Oh, very cozy. I can't afford a studio and an apartment. This does nicely for both. Hello, Jean-Jacques, are you very hungry? How is the sculpting business anyhow, financially I mean? Confidentially and no puns intended, it's a bust. You do these recently? No, in France. I studied at Vandenburg. Oh, when was that? Two years before the occupation. Too bad about the French. July the 16th, 1429. I never was good at dates. That's the day that Joan of arc liberated France after 100 years of occupation. Joan of arc never ran into a panzer division. Liberty, equality, fraternity, that's out for good. The Nazis will see to that. - The French are finished. - Finished? You don't know the French as I do, the plain people, their good common sense, their stubborn pride, their faith, deep faith. Well, that's a very pretty speech. - You're a pretty, too. - Why, in France, they've. We aren't in France, we're in San Francisco, and I didn't come up here to talk politics. Politics? I'm not talking politics. It's the indestructible... Goodnight, Mr. Brady. Oh, you don't really want me to go, do you? - Not now. - Now. I believe I'll stay. I'd hate to have to fracture your skull, Mr. Brady. You know, uncle Arthur really. Oh, stop that idiotic uncle Arthur routine. I haven't spoken to that stingy, self-righteous old goat for years. He'd no more give you my address than he turned up at a board of directors' meeting without his clothes on. Who are you, Mr. Brady, and what do you want? You're a pretty smart girl, miss Rogers. You're right, uncle Arthur definitely didn't ask me to look you up. You see, it's not Mr. Brady. It's commander Brady, office of strategic services. Ever hear of us? - No. - Sit down. You and I wanna do some serious talking. Here's what your ordered, skipper. Plastic explosive that looks, feels, and tastes like modeling Clay. What are you doing, going in the art business? Not a bad idea. Why can't we develop a whole line of our store merchandise? More plastic explosive put up as tubes of paint, timed pencils as crayons, rails of fuse, picture wire. Can do. You can actually model with this explosive? There's a bust of you, oughta be in the Mellon institute. Give me Phil, please. Hello, Phil? Brady. Is applejack ready for consignment to London? Good, then ship them. The girl can join them there. Floor, please? Floor, please. - Three. - Three. Yes? I'm in the lobby. I think I'm being followed. Sit tight, I'll be right down. I'm sorry I'm late, but I think I've been followed. Oh, no, come inside. I like to see my people security conscious. Gentlemen, this is Elaine. Gates, bernay, Martin. - How do you do? - Hello. How do you do? Applejack is now complete. We'll stay up here. No chance to talk in the shelter. Why are the lights gone out? Well, they probably pulled a switch downstairs. They often do. - May I smoke? - Certainly. That helps. I'm scared stiff. We all are. Now then, as soon as your clothes and documents are in order, you'll leave London. Any questions? - This young lady, sir. - Yes? Is she going with us? - Yes. - Why? We'll come to that later. What's on your mind? Come on, get it off your chest. All right, how do we treat her? Because I'm a woman? That's right. You forget it. Look, it's gonna be pretty rugged out there. Tough to buy a cup of coffee, tough to find a place to sleep. Let's clear that up right now. You're not supposed to be my social secretary. I'll buy my own cup of coffee and find my own place to sleep. Suppose you get picked up? You're not supposed to be my body guard. Martin, some of the most successful agents in history were women. Yeah, I know, but women like mata hari. How do you know what kind of a woman I am? Well, I think you're the kind that oughta be raising a couple of kids in Cleveland heights. Typical male bromide, Mr. Martin. Evidently you're a charter member of the society for the protection of American womanhood. Very witty, but it doesn't impress me. There's bound to be a lot of excitement out there and I wanna be sure everybody was going to keep calm. She seems to be doing very nicely at the moment. Furthermore, she wouldn't be here unless we thought she was qualified. It's nothing personal, commander. I, I'm just concerned about operating successfully. I, I think we can, Mr. Martin, if you'll stop worrying about my sex. Treat me like any other member of the team. Right. Right. Now, you all know where you're going and you know your objectives. The corbiel melun tunnel is the jackpot. And the first thing you do after landing is to contact FFI headquarters at an inn called the Chavel noir near the outskirts. Remember, operating undercover is like deep sea diving. You're in a hostile ocean under tremendous pressure. Your radio is your lifeline back here to us. Your cover story is your diving suit. Breaking either of them means trouble. The raid is past. That's better. Now let's go over your cover stories. Gates? My name is Raul Jesse, I'm Parisian. I used to be an automobile salesman, but when the war came, the office was closed. I've been unemployed most of the time since. My health is bad, lung trouble. I've come here to stay at a farm near the city. Bad lungs. X-rays. Certainly bad, all right, who's are they? Mine. If I were the gestapo, I'd have you shot. These are American plates. Have French ones made. Bernay? My name is Albert Bernardi. I am a ski and ice skating instructor. I work winter resorts all over, Saranac Lake, Sun Valley, San Maritz. I'm looking for a man I heard who was about to open a skating rink. I can't find him and I'm short of funds. I'll take any kinda work I can find. You're a pretty husky young fellow. Why aren't you a prisoner of war in a labor battalion? That's right, I forgot to tell you. I'm not French, I'm Swiss from Fribourg. The war caught me in France and I have been able to get back. That's better. Martin? My name is Philip Martin. I lost my mother when I was eight years old and went to live with my aunt in the United States. Came back for military service in 1935. Trained 18 months and then got a job as a newspaper correspondent with an American newspaper. Called back up in 1939, fought at Sudan, was captured with my division, later released by the Germans to work for them at the Renault factory. When the factory was bombed out, they told me to report for work here at the railroad yards. Too glib, otherwise okay. My name is Elaine Duprez. My home is in Noire, where my family has lived for generations on the rue coeur. I'm a sculptress, graduate of Fontainebleau. Every year my husband and I used to spend our vacation near here. He was a writer. His name is Jean. This ear I've come alone. Y Jean was killed in the Ardennes. A writer? I said I was a correspondent, but my articles would have appeared in the United States. You can find Jean Duprez's work in the back issues of many French magazines. Oh, then, Elaine Duprez is real. She was my roommate at Fontainebleau. We were inseparable. People used to call us the sisters. What happens if you run into her? I won't, she's missing. This is her last letter. Goodbye, my sister. It will be evening soon and I shall walk down to the beach and on out into the surf. Thinking of you, thinking of Jean. We are picking up something on the radar, heir leichtman. A lone, unidentified plane. Where is it? Bearing four seven, range one five. It's throwing enemy formation reported earlier. It might be a straggler. Parachutes perhaps. The moon is red. Counterintelligence, please. I still don't see any lights. Hello back there. No reception committee. Are we turning back? There's no FFI reception committee. Do you want to turn back? No, we'll jump blind. They'll jump blind. We're running in. Watch the signal lights, sergeant. Action stations. Action stations. She'll freeze. Bury the chutes with the rest of the stuff. We should get started. - — Oh, here she is. - Good. Wait a minute. There's a road runs through here somewhere to the highway. Up there. According to the map, the inn's about five miles east. We'll lay low. If we make contact, we'll send for you. If it's a washout, we'll come back. Are you ready? Let's go. Cover this area, le Chavel noir. They've been rendezvousing there. Don't raid it, merely watch it. Madame is a stranger here? Oh no, I come here every year. - You're alone? - Yes. I used to come with my husband, but he was killed two years ago. - Your papers, please. - Of course. The man is my husband. Drafty in here. Waiter, waiter? Can I have my bill, please? Thank you. I'm going up there and look for them. I'll go with you. No, someone's gotta stay here. What happens if you don't come back? Get the radio set up and ask London. Okay. Where's gates? He never came out. He gave me a danger signal. I waited for him by the highway, but he never came. A man could have helped him fight his way out. Come on. Gestapo. Gates? They got him back at the inn. Gates, he'll talk his way out of it. He's smart. Gates! Smart, huh? Look at his eyes! Please, close them. Gracie? Have this decoded and sent to commander Brady. I'm flying back to Washington on Saturday. Thank you. First contact with one of our teams, sir, - applejack. - That's fine. They lost a man, gates. I'm sorry. We've had a few first rate chaps knocked out, too. Are they in touch with FFI? Not yet, sir. The contact we'd set up for them washed out. Take this message and pass it along to be coded. Brady to applejack, Martin take over. Imperative you contact FFI and proceed with mission. Suggest Duprez approach persons formerly known to her who may be sympathetic. Your pleasure, mademoiselle. Madame, madame Elaine Duprez. Duprez? Yes, madame? Don't you recognize me, papa. Oh, I'm afraid I. Perhaps you remember my husband. Duprez? Oh, the architect. The writer. He's dead. A pity, madame, and with children. No children. Perhaps that's just as well in times like these. Times are bad, yes. The allied bombings, shortages, de gaulle, but the government will work things out. It has my unqualified support. Was there anything else, madame? You've forgotten the last war, papa? You've forgiven them for that? Good day, madame. I must ask you not to patronize my shop again. If you do... Do you have a finishing rasp in stock? You used to carry an American brand made of Pittsburgh steel. Yes, I remember. Unfortunately, I have none left. What became of your American friend, madame duprez? She went home. Perhaps someday she'll come back. A great many Americans are coming back, papa. 20-car train, 6:00 am, le mans. Get scissors sharpened, knives and scissors sharpened. Knives and scissors sharpened. You there! I'll come down. Can you sharpen these for me? 10 francs, madame. 20-car train, 6:00 am, le mans. Gracie! Wait a minute, there's something else coming in. - The second one was for you. - Me? Gracie! See if you can't have this coded for me. Get these over to our intelligent right away. Yes, sir. Targets from applejack, Schenectady, sombrero, subway, cuma, red Rose. - We're really in business. - Right. The air forces can ready to go to town on those railroads now. There's still some important targets the air force can't seem to get at. London wants us to bear down on them, particularly the Corbeil Melun tunnel. That's a closed military area, every approach guarded. We tried again last week, no luck. Well, we've gotta keep on trying, it's a must. What about the bridge at Rostan? They're grouping out. Who takes the charbon repair sheds? - My group. - All right. Fine, we have the explosives here for you. I have yours already made up, monsieur Reynal. We give unlimited credit. Caution, Reynal. Handle with care. We have prepared the plastic inside the tubes for immediate use. Please go on, madame duprez. The new trim is therefore actually a very old one. That the return to the classic form was a certain neutralization of modern technique. Good afternoon. I am fortunate to find you open. A little Sunday afternoon discussion, colonel, but if I can be of any assistance. I am quite sure you can help me. Our key note must be sanity and health. At all costs, we must avoid the decadent spiritual attitude of a man like Modigliani. The general impression of him is of a. Cezanne, perhaps? Exactly, colonel, except in his earlier period. That was definitely classical. Quite so, but please continue. Don't you agree with me? Yes, sir? Ceruleen, my favorite blue. Oh, colonel paints. I find sketching more convenient these days. Young lady? Oh, an unusually gifted sculptress. May I meet her? Madame duprez? Madame duprez, may I present colonel. Meister, Paul Meister. - The colonel sketches. - Oh. - Merely impressions. - May we see them? As a matter of fact, I was looking for a 30-by-45 pad. This one is full. Oh, I'm sure I have one here somewhere. I did this one in Rotterdam. Charming. Athens. Notice the bit of vine still clinging. Exquisite. Belgrade. Delightful. Here we are, colonel, 90 francs. Um, and now madame must permit me to see her work. But there's nothing of mine here, colonel. At your studio then. I have my car. Really, I haven't a thing to show you at the moment. Perhaps in several weeks, I. Madame's modesty becomes her. I shall make the usual allowances. Very well. Permit me. Will you make my apologies to your friends, please? You're quite sure you don't mind losing your guest of honor? At my age, colonel, one expects that sort of thing. She may learn something. Unfinished work, it really isn't fair. Are you sure we can't postpone this? Excellent light. A very fine studio. Your husband shares it with you, madame? I'm a widow, colonel. Oh, I'm sorry... In a way. Hmm, or perhaps madame has other arrangements? Again, I'm sorry. Hm-hmm, really very good, quite strong. Is he a Frenchman in the city? He's away on a job. He's an engineer. In the Normandy fortifications? He never tells me such things, colonel. Hmm, lovely, madame... Like yourself. You're very kind. Amazing technique for one so young. Donatello did his cherubs when he was only 22. One should never generalize about genius. We find it in the most unexpected places. At Aubert's, for instance, some of his proteges seem to have discovered their talents quite recently. Fascinating hands, remarkably feminine for this kind of work. Your pulse, madame, it's quite irregular. The colonel is a very discerning man. So, you're an incredible woman, my dear. Beauty and talent are rarely combined in a single individual. I confess I find it difficult to believe that these superb creations are yours or that you are what you say you are. Please, sit down, colonel. Our first sitting, colonel. Believe me, madame, I should be delighted to become the subject of a masterpiece. Turn your head a little bit more to the side, please. Brady's scorching me, he wants that tunnel out, then he'll pull us back to London. So far we can't near the place. You know you have a blind alley with this bird. He hasn't told you a thing. Break it off with him. That's my department. Don't overestimate yourself. He's dangerous. I can take care of myself. Look, I'm running the show now. We'll play it my way. You don't have much confidence in me, do you? I'd feel the same about any girl I was working with. That's very chivalrous of you and very impractical. I thought we'd settled all that. No special consideration for anyone. You're not a man, I'm not a woman. We're weapons. Oh, don't worry about colonel Meister. He's going. Going where? - I don't know. - When? Tomorrow afternoon. There's a a troop train going to Normandy through the tunnel. How soon could you duplicate this in the Clay we brought with us? Tomorrow noon. Fine, what I said still goes. You can back out of this if you want to. Yes. All right, could you get the colonel to... Forget it. To take me with him? I said forget it. Elaine, it's Paul. Elaine? Why, Paul, you're early. I can't make it later, my dear, staff meeting. I am late already. Oh, Paul. I'm sorry, Elaine, but it can't be helped. Our last evening. Will you miss me, Elaine? Take me with you. Impossible, my dear. Not for an officer of your importance. Ah, I might arrange it at that. Of course, you can. Please do. You're very persuasive, my dear, but you're not deceiving me. I know why you want to come with me. Does that surprise you? It shouldn't. I'm moderately intelligent, Elaine. I've known how matters stood since the day I met you. Have you? You're an engineer. You're trying to get to Normandy. Travel permits are almost impossible to obtain. You're so clever, Paul. But you're so unscrupulous, silly. I'm sure you understand. Of course, I do. That's why I'll take you with me. Thank you, Paul, thank you. I'm that sort of a man. After all, our little masterpiece is still incomplete, a pleasant journey together, the weekend perhaps to finish it. And then, dear girl, go with my blessing. - Yes? - The colonel's secretary is in that compartment. Inspector Martin, check rider. I'll go with you as far as le mans. How's she holding up? Inspection, huh. This patched up piece of junk? We're 30 minutes late. We should have passed the corbiel melun tunnel at 3:26. There it is. Now get over there. Slow it down. I said slow down. Why are you doing this, monsieur? For France. Jump, both of you. Why have we stopped? I arranged it. It seems very strange. Nonsense, it only makes the journey longer. What can it be? Does it matter? Paul, anything could happen these days. Please, go and ask somebody. Later. I'm sorry, Paul, but I'm really frightened. Please, go and find out what's wrong, please. Corporal? Corporal! Can't you hear me, corporal? Where is that man? Corporal! Corporal! Come on! Hey, what's the matter? Who is that? What's happening in there? What's happening in there? Elaine, open that door! After those people! Watch your gun. What? Better reload, they're in my pocket. Those people, follow those people! Yes, corporal? There's nothing to report from applejack, sir. The signal's still dead. I'm afraid we will have to assign you to a different team, corporal. Couldn't I stay on them just one more day? I'm sorry, but in exactly 40 seconds, we're gonna need every available operator on life sources. It's not like the applejack will contact us again. They're either in custody or dead. Yes, sir. I've assigned you to team sombrero. Check with the section chief, that's all. - Oh, corporal? — yes, sir? Can you handle them both? Yes sir, yes, sir. You won't sleep much. I won't mind, sir. Thank you, sir. Come on. He isn't here. Kneel down. I've never said so many hail Marys in my life. Where have you been? It's been a rat race. Did you lose him? Back down the road somewhere. Where's the car? No car, nothing. Meister moved in too fast. Aubert? Picked up, walloped. Where do we go from here, chief? Well, our best bet is to lose ourselves in that crowd. All right, we'll locate a radio and contact Brady and have him send a plane in. That's for me. I got a date the 4th of July with little sparky. Who? Our operator in London. Funny how you get to know each other's fists. I'd know hers any time. I stood her up Easter Sunday and may day. How long can a guy expect a dame to wait, especially when she's never even seen me? All right, come on, shove off. Keep moving to the east. We'll meet in the park in Dijon. Come on. It's safer if we travel alone. You're in pretty bad shape. I'll manage. - Look. - You do your part, I'll do mine. We almost failed in the tunnel because you came back for me. Never come back for me again. Do you understand? Never come back! Hello. Hello. I got in this afternoon. You've changed. I'm hungry. Do we have any money? A little. The FFI got us jobs at the airport. Did they get you a radio? No, not yet. I've had to move carefully. There's a crack gestapo at work I've been working on here. Come on, I'll get you something to eat. - Too crowded. - Come on. Good evening, monsieur Martin. I'm sorry, there must be some mistake. Madame duprez, charming as usual. Monsieur Bernardi, he's not with you this evening? Duprez, Bernardi? You are quite wrong, monsieur. I think not, I'm Amadeus brink, gestapo. May I join you? Waiter! Should that be a weapon, monsieur, you're forgetting my colleague here, Answald. He's sitting just outside. Clever these new methods. An associate of mine was recently shot by a fountain pen. Shall we order? Later perhaps. Fine work, that tunnel job of yours. Tunnel? What are you talking about? I have a full report of your activities. It arrived at headquarters last week. Would you care to see it? It's outrageous, monsieur, you intrude upon us, - you presume to- - I would prefer to discuss the matter at headquarters. What do you mean by prefer? Let me see those papers. Fortunately, I took them out of the file before any of my colleagues saw them. What do you want from us? Monsieur begins to understand. Obviously, what I want from you isn't the question. What do you want from me? A very sensible, man, Herr brink. It's quite evident that his side is going to lose the war, and being a practical man, he has to look to the future. I could be useful to you, monsieur, very useful. Just how? I have access to several interesting sources of information. The contents of the weekly Dijon-Berlin military pouch, for instance. The courier is my cousin. What's your price, Herr brink, immunity? That goes without saying. A small weekly payment, we'll arrive at an equitable figure, and 50,000 American dollars deposited to my account in the bank of Switzerland. Maybe we can do business. I was sure we could. You'll have to get us a radio. Oddly enough, I have another cousin who might be persuaded to lend you one. - Good. - But naturally, that would be extra, 20,000 francs. Well, we're short of funds right now till we contact our principal. Until then, only too glad to accommodate you at a fair rate of interest, of course. Shall we say 10%? I'm a reasonable man and I'm sure we can work out the details to our mutual satisfaction. Good evening, monsieur, madame, a pleasure meeting you. Till tomorrow then at the same time? Here. Refugees, perfectly all right. Charming couple, madly in love with each other. Note from Brady. Enthusiastic applejack information prime source thus far. Keep it up. New papers, about time. Brink's weekly payoff. Come on, let's get outta here. The courier? He was here this morning. Our gestapo spotters are closing in on your radio. One more message and they'll pick you up. Suspend operations till I find another place for the radio. It, uh, might take a week. I, uh, consider this friendly little gesture worth considerably 20,000 francs, and double the weekly payments when we resume operations. One of the documents I photographed this morning was red hot. The krauts have busted a top American code. It's all on the film. A broken code? Brady's gotta know about that quick. Our whole communication system might be compromised. Tell him what we've got. Get a plane in here tomorrow night, a big one, to take us out with that film. I'm through, we've had enough. What's the matter? You wanna see little sparky, don't you? The radio, if I try to. Yeah, what about it? Nothing. What's the matter, Mary, anything wrong? It's the first time there's nothing just for me. Something's happened, I know it has. I know it. Bernay? I haven't seen him. Maybe he'll meet as at the field. The film? Good evening. May I trouble you for your papers? I'm afraid I must ask you to come with me to headquarters. Martin? Duprez? They were traced to this sector months ago. Unreported since. - That seems strange, colonel. - Very strange. Particularly since we picked up their radio man last night, the very night I arrived. Colonel, every effort will be made. I assure you it will, Herr brink. I wish to see the entire staff later this evening. Tonight? We sleep here at night? Tonight. Your papers seem to be in order. Can I be of assistance here, Answald? Merely a routine checkup of all non-natives. You understand we can make no exceptions. I'm afraid you'll have to submit to the usual search. Herr brink? - Inspector. - Come here. Would you accompany madame to the matron? A pleasure, Herr Answald. Remove your clothes. The matron finds nothing to report here, Answald. Your effects, monsieur, you may have them now. My apologies for detaining you. I hope we haven't inconvenienced you too seriously. You mean we can go now? We appreciate your cooperation. The hat. One moment. Your hat, monsieur. Again, my apologies. Match? Oh, no, thanks, I think I'll wait till I get outside. Where'd you put it? - In my glove. - Thanks. Monsieur, madame, we've made you late for an appointment perhaps. Get us a car and we won't miss it. This way if you please. They picked the radio up last night. - Bernardi? - He's dead. I warned him. There are complications, a new chief, he's, uh, been inquiring about you. It will be necessary to put your papers back in the files. You'll drive to the outskirts and I'll wait for you there. Keep your appointment and drive the car back as soon as possible. I'm needed at headquarters. Bernardi didn't tell us you warned him. Do you think he got through to London? He was on the air long enough. I'm sure he did. Incidentally, for the use of the car, shall we say 20,000 francs? I can't stop it. Embarrassing being seen together in one of the gestapo's own car. I'm afraid I must leave you. Brink, come here. Look, Meister! Who are these people? Who, colonel? With you in the car. Jump out, we can get there some other way. There's no time. Make way, pull your car over to the right. You, the driver, get that car off the road. Follow me, sir. They're escorting us. They think it's an official trip. Who are they? Herr Answald and... Halt! See if he's armed. Let me see those. Martin, duprez, bernardi. Take him to headquarters. Follow them. I don't suppose it'd be possible to discuss this in a purely business way, Herr major? Shall we say 100,000 francs? No, I suppose not. Such a pity. We're being followed. Hang on, we're gonna turn off. London, we'll be there in two hours. You know what I'd like to say? Skip it, let's get outta here. Here's the film. Great work, where's bernay? We lost him. - When? - Last night. What happened? I'll tell you about it in London. Martin, I came in personally because I have something to ask you, the kind of thing you have to say face—to-face. Look, we only got here a half a jump ahead of the gestapo. Can't we talk about it up there? I'm afraid not. Martin, the Germans are licked. They're falling back to the Rhine where they're expected to make a last stand on the east bank. That's great, but what has that got to do with us? As a general policy, we never ask any of our people to take an assignment they don't want. That's why I'd like you to tell me you'll do one more job for us. Another job? Sometime ago we put a man into Germany posing as a Rhine bargeman. The secretary he was assigned to has been selected for one of our crossings. If he's still alive, he must have invaluable information on troop dispositions and fortifications. I don't get it. There's no way for him to get that information out. We want somebody to go in there and contact him and send it out on this ground air radio. How long do you think we can live like this, with our guts turning over every time a foot falls or a door opens, under pressure 24 hours a day, grinding us to pieces? You've got plenty of other people working for you. Why don't you get somebody else to handle this deal? Why do you have to pick on me? Because you're the only available agent who would recognize our man in Germany, the only agent he would recognize. Remember Parker? - Parker? - You trained with him. Yeah, sure, I remember him, so what? I'm no hero. I don't wanna volunteer for anything. I wanna grab a hold of my life again. I want my identity back. Don't you suppose Parker wants his identity back? Don't pass me the buck. If you want me to take over that assignment, you've gotta order me to take it over. It's an order. Okay. London in two hours. Will you be there when I get back? When we go, we'll go together. You're going now with the commander. That's up to him, isn't it? Take her back. She doesn't know Parker and Parker doesn't know her. We're a team, aren't we? - But it's different now. - It needn't be. Mesiter's breathing down our necks. How much longer do you think our luck can hold out? Gates, bernay, we're next. Go on back to England. I'll handle this deal alone. We work well together. Two agents are better than one. It doubles your chances. She's right, Martin. As long as she's offered to stay on, that's it. Time for us to be shoving off, sir. Here are your instructions. After you've memorized them, destroy them. Always in the spring. Maybe you'll be spared this time, aunt Bernice. The barges have been crossing the river all day. Stealing everything they can lay their hands on. The good lord was with me hiding these. Set it here, Gerard. What was the plan, grandmere? The men have all run away. They'll come back. They came back in 1870, in 1914, in 1940. Take care, niece, at least one eye and no more than three in each cutting. The plane again? Tell monsieur Martin when he speaks to it to tell our American friends to hurry or else we'll be too late with the plowing this year. Bosches, take those down, Gerard. They're pouring across the Rhine. Bridges, boats, barges... Anything that will float. Speak slower, pal, more distinctly. Keep us in range, you're fading. What about Parker? No sign of him. We've been down to the docks every day for a month. That's off now. They restricted the area. Most of the bargeman ran off when our plane started strafing. If Parker stayed on, we might have shot him up ourselves. Tell him to lay off for a while. Night fighters coming in at two o'clock. Call off the radio, enemy planes, break it off. Trouble. We'll be back 100. Stand against the wall, all of you. Listen, I'm Parker. I'm sorry I had to do that. I saw you and Martin down at the docks with the old lady, but I couldn't get to you. That's why I took this uniform off a drunk and fell in with this bunch. The crowds are milling around down there trying to get across and bolster their defenses on the east bank. I have their troop dispositions down cold. Can you get them out? Martin has an air ground radio hidden, if you could get to it. Good, I'll get rid of these krauts. I've got to lay low in the village until our army comes through. Now, it's 5 miles between Flintersburg and Truben, with nothing but a few patrols between. That's just one of their weak spots. There's another just north of Wesseling. If our troops cross at those spots, we'll save lives, thousands. Now repeat after me. The 146th panzer division in reserve at Bornheim. 146th panzer division in reserve near Bornheim. The 122nd grenadiers just west of Lahnstein. The 122nd grenadiers just west of Lahnstein. Better? I'll be all right. Come inside and lie down for a bit. Lie down. The plane? A couple of night fighters chased it away. - Be back at one o'clock. - One o'clock. What did Parker tell you? I memorized it. If it gets there in time, thousands of lives will be saved. And our job should be over. Soon. There isn't much time. There's a lot to learn. Shoot 146th panzer division in reserve near Bornheim. 146th panzer division in reserve near Bornheim. - Do you think you've got it? - Yes. Here's some water, Gerard. Oh, you'll be leaving me soon? Where you go, you'll be together? Yes, we'll be together. You'll, you'll be happy, very happy. Goodnight, my children. We never had our little weekend in Normandy, did we? A great pity, we had so much in common. You remember me, of course, Meister? Paul Meister? I remember you very well. You're alone here. Quite alone. Unfortunately, we can't take too much time finding out whether you're telling the truth. Who lives here? The house is mine. We shall properly acknowledge your hospitality, madame. Put her in the car. The other prisoner, Herr colonel? I'll deal with her. Wait outside. I am sure you have no illusions about your own treatment. None, shall we go now? I still find you a remarkably attractive woman. I can almost forgive myself, myself, not you my dear. I find this very distasteful, colonel. All I ask is that I be taken quickly to wherever people like myself are taken, and dealt with. Permit me to enjoy this reunion a few moments longer. I find it curiously satisfying. Monsieur! The women, monsieur, they're taking them away, I heard him! Who? He said his name was Meister. Here, monsieur. Come back, please come back! Don't let him take them away. Who was he with? Only two other soldiers, but hurry, hurry. She saw me at the door, she knows I went for you. Come, please. Please, hurry, hurry. Never come back for me again. Thousands of lives will be saved. Never come back. - Thousands of lives. - Please hurry! I can't, boy, I can't! Gerard, listen, I'm... Are you down there, applejack, can you hear me? Recorder's on, go ahead, you're coming in fine. 146th panzer division reserve near Bornheim. 146th panzer division in reserve near Bornheim. 122nd grenadiers just west of Lahnstein, Lahnstein, Lahnstein! The 8th infantry division south of Roburg Canal. Too fast, slower. Keep us in range. Roburg, r-o-b-u-r-g, 8th, roburg canal. 31st at Linkhurn. 31st at Linkhurn. The 18th SS division around Horst and Steinbrook. Let's have that last again. I want a clean recording. 18th SS division around Horst and Steinbrook. 52nd infantry division east of Friehoff north of the highway. Just once more and we'll have it. The 18th SS division around Horst and Steinbrook. 52nd infantry division east of Friehoff, north of the highway. Okay, applejack, that's it. Radio operator to pilot, let's go. Elaine! Elaine! Job's almost done, Martin, thanks. Don't thank me, thank the others, they're the ones... Gates, bernay, du... Tell me about her, commander. I didn't even know her real name. Rogers, Ellen Rogers. Ellen, where was she born? I don't remember, but I can find out for you if you like. No, it doesn't matter. It was somewhere back home, like the town I came from, the same town maybe. Why, she, she might have lived just around the corner.
