Isaac Lemay roamed the Great Plains in western territories, taking up with whores and siring children across the land without thought to consequence. He gained employment clearing Cheyenne for the army and it was the ugliness of this task which turned him to ruin. For his crimes the Cheyenne chief White Thunder cursed him to be killed by his own seed. Haunted, he tracked down his children one by one to kill them before they did the same to him. Lionel! Rumor is there's a man from the plains goin' around killing his own kin. Says he come back here to wipe his seed from the earth. You heard this rumor? The man carries an ivory handled Colt. Much like the one you're carrying. Finish the whiskey and leave. What do you want from me? I've done nothing wrong. You were born. Get out. We ain't finished yet. What the hell? Get... I ain't done. Go on, here. Poor Lionel. He didn't deserve that. Tell me about the twin. There is no twin. What's his name? You got some bad information. Look what that fucker did to me! Somebody kill that motherfucker! Why don't you kill yourself, Lemay! You're the devil! - You're gonna do something? - Come on, come on. You're gonna let him get away with that! Are you really gonna let him get away with that? He cut off my fucking thumb. Somebody do something! Can I help you? You Coleman? Yeah, I'm Coleman. Looking for Claire. Who are you? I'm her old friend. What's that you said outside? You're old friends with Claire. Well, those days have passed. She'll be coming back from church real soon now. You sit tight. Hello, father. My daughter Megan. How old are you again? 16. How do you know mama? Are you a gold miner? No, I'm a hunter. She's mine. She's not. She got the mark on her neck? She doesn't have a mark. You know what I'm gonna do to her? There's rumors about you. Yeah? At church. At church. You go to church? They say you've been cursed by Cheyenne. That you're to be killed by the hand of your son. By my child? She isn't yours. She's never hurt a thing in her life. Yeah? She's nothing like you. Yeah she is. In your fucking house! You scared me. You're cold. Come with me. Tell you something you wanna know. Out there, past those mountains, lies the plains. And that is where I met your mama. And that is where you are from. There. You feel it? We don't have the power to stop it. Power to stop what? What? I'm not gonna let him harm our daughter. My daughter. You go out there, he'll kill you. Here. Here. Go on. You feel it? You feel it? Go on. You're not the one who's gonna kill me. What did you do to my daughter? She's fine. Where's the bank manager? Do you know where the bank manager is? You don't know either, huh? What about you? Do you know where the bank manager is? Can you come on out here for me, sir? Nice to meet you. You got a nice place here. Aw, chin up man. You look good. That's nice. Ma'am. Take a kneel for me, sir. Get on your knees. Thank you. Ma'am. He was born along with his twin brother Lionel in the year 1858. Unwilling to raise him in a brothel, his mother abandoned him at the Virginia City Home for Boys. Over the years, she would visit him at the orphanage, but never requested custody. Logan's gonna try. Can't waste the ammo. Who the hell is out there? Son of a bitch! I knew it was you! You son of a whore! Would you look at that. Oh, he's as innocent as a newborn lamb. Hi. Now, why would you do that? I like your name. Does the job. What happened? You need to leave town. Who did this? Your father. He's looking for you. What's he want? Brooks, Canada in a month. Just as we planned. Just we can't go together anymore. I'll meet you there. Y'all finished? Fuck you. Get out. I want you to come and live with me. I need to protect you. But I'm not the one in need of protecting. I ain't scared of him. I ain't scared of no one. You go alone. I'll meet you there. Why don't I stay here tonight? You can't. What if I was a customer? Why you always want me to leave? Because I love you. What does that mean? What does that mean? Think Cal got some. Sure looks like it. He looks worn. You with Anna? Anna is one hell of a whore, I tell you. One hell of a whore. You want a cigarette? I'm such a fool for thinking I could've been a mother. Can't blame yourself. He wasn't always wrong. Not when he was little. I'm sure you done your best. I just wanna know why. Why what? Why the devil won't leave us alone? Is the curse over? It's not a curse. It's a prophecy. Some sort of game gun. Not your standard Sharp's that's for sure. Shots done point blank with a big gun. Them holes in Wilson, that's a 45. No hurry. Walked straight up to these two. Boom. Boom. Three men. But only one shoots. Still can't believe you grew up Indian. What'd they do to you? They raised me. It's a perfect spot for an ambush. Not amateurs, then? Not amateurs. Whoever did this to my men, my men. Not telling what he'll do with my Gatling gun. Criminal isn't trained. Won't be able to work it. You'd be surprised at what people can do. That's the last of 'em. Every soldier trained on the Gatling gun in the region. You want some kind of help with these? Look at this. Name Cal Talisker. Raised as an orphan in Virginia City. Joined the army and trained as a loader on the Gatling gun. Discharged for lying about his age and insubordination. Look who his superior officer was. Wilson. Where you going? Virginia City. The devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, Mama? The devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil! Oh, the devil! The devil! The devil! Good lord, Solomon. What brings you by? Buck, mind if we speak? Yeah, sure as hell do. What's on your mind? I need your help. Really? I'm looking for a man. A man with a whore mother. He been causing some trouble around here and stole some of my army equipment. Oh, I haven't seen anybody matching that description. Any other problems around here? We did have a murder the other night. - Murder? - Yeah. Brutal stabbing in the saloon. I suspect it had to do with a gambling debt. You catch the game? Nope. No sign of him. Uh, just a boy, supposedly. A boy? Yeah, 19, maybe 20 years old. Hmm. Which saloon? The Two-One. Need another? I wanna meet your whores. What's your preference? Her. Were you here when the murder happened the other night? Was it your boy? That's why you're here? Yeah. Kept it? Eagle feather. You shouldn't have this. I thought it was for courage, during the hard times. Many people thought so. I love that eagle feather. Hey. Made lieutenant. Are you married? No. You look tired. I am tired. What a shame. What are you doing? I'm gonna bury this innocent creature. That's someone's catch. Trapping innocent animals to get their pelt. What kind of evil man does this? Feel like animals deserve funerals more than humans. Cal, we don't even have a pick or a shovel. And don't you think we should be going? Heading North. We're not going North. Why not? We got things to attend to. Cal, not for nothing, you just stabbed a man to death back in Red Bluff. Law's gonna be looking for us. You're right. We ought to be prepared. For what? To kill my father. Morning. A box of .45's. Cost you a dollar. Some youngins came through town, just wanna know where they went. We got lots of types come in here. I know when that group come in, weren't no good. So these boys were no good, but you sold them ammunition anyway. Not in my position to do otherwise. Blood will be on your hands sir. You don't know what's coming. Holy Christ! You alone out here? We got a camp right over yonder. You can join us for breakfast if you want. This has always been my favorite part of you. Tell me about your boy. Don't ask me that. That's not why you're here. It is. It's part of it. I never asked you for what I know you couldn't give. He killed folks. And I born him. Where'd he go, Anna? Let him go. Just please, please. Let him go. Solomon! Gideon, the man I was telling you about. We're looking for a man who's been wandering around these parts. He's killing his own kin. We're getting rumors out of Kansas and Nebraska that he killed six young men last year. They were all sired by whores. I never heard such a thing. We need a tracker who knows these parts. I hear you're that man. I got problems of my own. Pay you a dollar a day. Don't care about the money. Then do it for Jesus. I care about Him even less. A penny buys you two. I like your locket there. Who you got inside? Inside? A picture of your parents? Or a sweetheart? Nobody. He was a good friend. Yeah, he knew the danger. My hand is killing me. Yeah, you best get that bandaged professionally. In the war, most men died from infection. Smart place to go would be Dillon. Hey Patty, you think God loves us? I need you to fix my hand. Well, take a cot. I've got mining to do. Would you mind putting a muzzle on that? What ails you? My hand. Myself, I've just returned from Brazil, godforsaken land. It's left me with a condition I'm unable to shake. The Brazilians are a disgusting people. Well, if you don't like Brazil so much, why'd you go to Brazil? The work. Arab slave traders pay a mighty penny still. This land has lost its taste for violence. Lost the taste for conquest. I sought it elsewhere, the climate and people, didn't suit me. Would you like to see something? Yeah. My father gave this to me. Not sure how long I've had it now, but... They didn't teach you to look at people when you talk? I am looking at you. Is that an Indian head? Not just any Indian. It's Gomez. The great Apache chief. This head was worth $2,000 before you and I were born. Son of a bitch. Grayton Willets. Of the Willets clan. Those three marks on your chin, they come off? Nope. Buck told me you were taken as a child. Found. A better word is found. They raised me when my family was killed. I cannot imagine. You read of the Scripture, Solomon? No. The Bible says, "Satan goes to and fro across the Earth like a roaring lion, searching for someone to devour." This man that we're chasing, I'm beginning to think we might be chasing the devil himself. He's just a man. Like the rest of us. You don't believe in God? What do you believe in? I believe we'll catch a murderer tomorrow. Must admit your proposal is one of the more grotesque I've come across. Helping killing your own father. Well, he's supposed to be one of the worst killers this land's ever known. A little secret about legendary gunfighters, they tend to die like the rest of us when shot in the head. Tell me about this gun you got your hands on. Army issue. .45 caliber. - 200 rounds a minute. - Whoa! What the fuck is that? What are you doing? Well, helping a man out. Man's got no horse, gonna die out here when the sun sets. Ashes to ashes. Banged up pretty bad, aren't you? What happened? What? Get my gun. He wants me to get his gun. Take me with you. Can't do that. You got any money on you? I'll tell you something that you wanna know. And what the fuck would I want to know? Pray tell me. Go on. You ain't the one. Die. You're surrounded by armed men. Don't move or I'll shoot you. Easy. Cheyenne? Yeah, you could say that. Only ones I could never hear. If it was me, we'd burn you alive. I know what you really are. You may not be the devil himself, but I know you are familiar with his ways. Easy Gideon. Solomon, he's got a right to give the beast a piece of his mind. Yeah, I'd give him one piece. Hey. You'd kill me to protect him? Hand it over. You don't see what he really is. What are you gonna do when the Rapture comes? Come let's go, come, get. What do you think? I think it's the most magnificent thing I've ever seen. We best get a move on. All those guns could belong to some law. You got some men we can call on to help assist with this task? I believe I do. Gather round, ye men of the Willets clan! What you got there, brother? New friend. And a new toy. Where, pray tell did you find this immaculate piece of weaponry? I didn't find it. I took it. Killed a lot of men to get this gun. What say we have a drink? You trust this clan? I don't gotta trust them. I just need a few men to help me kill my father. Because he cut your mama's finger off? I can understand if you're scared. Want to get out of here, cut loose. This ain't your problem. And go where? Do what? You really do what they say? What do they say? Kill your children? Their blood was cursed. Not even the Cheyenne believe these things anymore. All my life, people been scared of me. Disgusted by me, but nobody ever asked me what it means. It means safe passage. To the afterlife. I believe you and I have found ourself in a situation of mutual interest. You know where my father is? Yes, I do. And I know something better than that. I know where's he going. You gotta make me a promise. What's that? Kill him good. When you going? Tomorrow. Oh. Thought you'd last longer than a week. Just needed some scratch to get on through. You wanna come? Your boy killed more men. He did not. I told you he left. Where? You're aiding and abetting a criminal. What did you say? Aiding a boy I brought into this world. A boy I love so much. A boy I couldn't do anything for, let him go, when all I wanted to do was to take care of him myself. No, no, don't. What are you doing with him? Please don't do this, please. Just, just calm down. Thanks, soldier. What have you done! Hey! Hey! Now pack your things. Come on, let's get a move on. I can't do this. I did this for you. You're just like him. You're the devil. You killed the man... Huh? Killed the man that what? Killed the man that what? You killed the man I loved. I can't go with you. What the hell are you gonna do here? Same as I've always done. I'm a whore. You are not a whore. You're not a whore. We're going up North. Together. What's going on here? He's in town. I heard you were a legend. My family makes their name killing legends. Make a nice head for my collection. You could have loved me. Hello, father. Let's ride. She did not wait to verify that he was dead. Or rather she moved on alone. For years. Until eventually settling into a quiet life in Carson City, Nevada. She married and bore three children who had no knowledge of their ancestor. Two oldest were girls. The last child, a son.
