[bells chiming] [holiday music] [slow instrumental music] - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Terance look at you. - Hi Grandpa! - You've grown near six inches. - Hello James. - Hey, thanks for having us. - Thank you for coming. Good to get to see you. - It's good to see you. I'm gonna take these upstairs baby. - Ah thank you, thank you. So, how ya feeling Dad? - I'm getting by. It's been hard since your mom died, but I'm going through the motions. - Yeah, I miss mom too. - Grandpa put up a Christmas tree! [slow instrumental music] - What! - What would Christmas be without a tree? - [Terence] Can we decorate it? Can we? - You do the hanging stuff and I'll do the stringing stuff okay? [slow instrumental music] - Here's Santa Claus. - All right, he goes right at the top of the tree and there's one more ornament, a very special one. - Uh huh, that's the last one. - Look a little harder. - Here it is. - That's Pete. - Who's Pete? - You don't know who Pete is? - Uh uh. - Well Dad, we were hoping that you would tell him the story. - You're the Pete expert. - Well, I can't tell the story of Santa and Pete without starting with Santa. He came first you know. Do you know what he was called before the world knew him as Santa Claus? St. Nicholas. [uplifting instrumental music] St. Nicholas is a Christian bishop who traveled the world performing small miracles. People claimed he lived for hundreds of years. To look at St. Nick, you might think that God was about to call him home. The thin on hair on his head no longer grew and his beard was white and wild. But by all accounts, St. Nicholas was a gentle man and children loved him. No matter where St. Nick was in his travels, he always returned home to Amsterdam to celebrate Christmas. And one year, he had to travel through Spain to get to Holland and in those days, there was still a large Moorish population in Spain. As luck would have it, or as bad luck would have it, the Spanish government who knew of his pilgrimages singled him out for persecution. - Persecution? What's that? - Son, that's when one group of people don't like the beliefs of another group of people. - I thought St. Nick was a good person. - Oh he was, but you see, in those days the Spaniards and Moors were not getting along and some people resented his power and his message of peace and brotherhood, so the Spanish government arrested him as a spy. - Spy! - Of course he wasn't a spy. But I tell you this, things didn't look good for St. Nick on that cold day in December. [whooshes] - What is this? - It's called the Book of Life. - What do you use it for? - It's a list of important names that I check on every year. Just about this time. - It's a very handy book for a spy. - Ha, we both know I'm not a spy. - It's evidence, put it away. What do you have in here? - Chocolate, games, toys, things of that nature. Tell me, do you have any children? - Yes, I do. And I can assure you they do not believe in St. Nicholas. [grunts] You made the wrong choice traveling through Spain old man. It looks like you will not be making it home for Christmas this year or any other year. [ominous music] Take him away. - [Grandpa Nicholas] As it were Christmas only a few weeks away, St. Nick was as far from home as a present could be. Lucky for him, he was about to meet Pete. [ominous music] [clattering] - Thank you Peter. - How did you know my name? - I know a lot of things about a lot of people. I know you have a big heart for one thing and I know you want to travel and see the world. - You could read my mind? - No, but I can read what's in your heart. - You're St. Nicholas aren't you? [grunts in affirmation] What are you doing in here? - They think I'm a spy. [laughs] - A spy? - I'm not of course. The only thing I carry with me wherever I go is a message of peace. - Tell me something St. Nicholas, you've been a lot of places, places I've only dreamed of, what's it like? - It's everything you could imagine. But I'll add this, wherever I've been on my travels, I've found that people are the same. They love and want to be loved. They want their life to amount to something. But they need help sometimes. That's where I come in. - St. Nicholas? Will you tell me about your travels? - There's a lot to tell. [slow instrumental music] - [Grandpa Nicholas] The two men wound up talking throughout the night. To look at them, you might have focused on their differences. One was black the other white. One was a cook the other a bishop. But Pete admired St. Nick's towering spirit and St. Nick instinctively knew that Pete had much to offer the world with his generous heart and joyous nature. Just before daybreak, Pete made the most important decision of his life. [plucky instrumental music] [snoring] - We better hurry, they'll be making their rounds any time now. - Peter, why are you doing this? - Because you're St. Nicholas and the world needs you, now come on. - You're taking a terrible risk! - Don't worry about that, come on. [building instrumental music] - Peter, Peter would you like to come with me? I could use a partner. - Me, I'm just a cook? - No, you're much more than that. But if you can't, I understand. [low shuffling] - Look Nick, you gotta get outta here right now. - I had a book, leather bound, very old. I can't leave without it. - Why's it so important to you? It's just a book. - Oh, it's infinitely more than that. - All right look, I'll go get it and you stay right here okay? I'll be back. [slow instrumental music] [snoring] [sneezes] - Hey! - St. Nicholas! Here's your book now let's get outta here! - Thought you weren't coming. - I think I just lost my job. [yelling] [uplifting instrumental music] - Wow! Pete broke Santa out of jail? - You bet he did. - Yes! - [James] That looks good. - Will you do the honors? - Thanks Nicholas. - Grandpa, was there really a man named Pete or are you making all this up? - There was a man named Pete and his story was passed down for hundreds of years until it became legend. - What's so important about The Book of Life anyway? - Well, only God and St. Nick knew for sure. You see, The Book of Life is filled with secrets. - Secrets? - About people's lives, past, present, and future. And if anybody else ever looked inside, they wouldn't remember a thing they saw once the book was closed. - Like magic. - You might say that. You know what else was magic? Santa and Pete. Before Pete knew it, they'd been partners for years. - Now, I think that we should plan things out a little better. - I prefer to go on instinct myself. - I can see that. - Well, served pretty well so far. - I still think we need an itinerary, some sort of detailed plan for our journey. - Life is the journey and God plans the itinerary. I know what you're thinking. - What? - That I'm too set in my ways. - That's exactly what I was. You do that a lot you know that? - What? - You always tell me what you think I'm thinking. - I can't help it, I've got a knack for it. How else do you think I know the difference between who's been naughty or who's been nice? - Well it's an annoying knack Nick. - But I do know what you're thinking, most of the time. - Well, even if you do, you don't always have to say it. Maybe, just maybe, I don't want to know what I'm thinking. - All right, I'll try not to tell you what you're thinking. - All right. [grunts] Here, this will tide you over till we get to the next town. You hungry, aren't you? - How'd you know? - I know what you're thinking sometimes too Nick, watch out. - What is it? - Dried fruit. - Dried fruit? - It's good for ya. - Looks dead. - Oh, I got some fruitcake too. I baked a loaf a few days ago. - Dried fruit or fruit cake. Suddenly I'm not hungry anymore. - More for me. [sweet instrumental music] That's good! Let's go. - [Grandpa Nicholas] No matter what Santa and Pete's differences were, they were united on one thing, the children. The children were always first in their hearts. And sure enough as time passed, the children grew to love Pete as much as they did St. Nick. One year, when St. Nick and Pete returned to Holland for their annual Christmas visit, they discovered that many of the children were missing. - Missing? - They had gone to the New World with their families. - Where's the New World? - The New World is here son, America. - That's right and St. Nick and Pete knew they had to follow the children to this land of new beginnings and endless dreams. [uplifting instrumental music] - I can't believe it! We're actually going to the New World! - Well, believe it. - Even the name sounds exciting. The New World. Whew man, what do you think it's gonna be like when we get there? - Like the old one, only newer. - Right, right, right. - Santa and Pete! I, I heard you were going to the New World. - We sure are. - Word travels fast. - I was hoping you might find someone for me. Her name's Elizabeth Van Olden. Please, please give her this ring and tell her I love her and I will join her as soon as possible. I want to marry her. - Well, we got a lot to do when we get there and-- - Peter, Peter, we're never too busy to help someone find their true love. - Excuse me. [slow instrumental music] Look, there gonna be a lot of people in the New World. It could be like looking for a needle in a haystack. - What's your name young man? - Henry, Henry Rutgers. - Well Henry, I promise you we'll do our best to try and find her. - Thank you so much! Thank you, you're my only hope! Have a good trip! - Good day Henry. - Good day to you! - Nick, you just told this man we'll find the woman he loves. We could end up breaking his heart. - Have faith Peter, we will find Miss Elizabeth Van Olden and we'll still have time to spend Christmas with the children. Now, we have a ship to catch. - The New World. [holiday music] - Close your eyes Dad. Put out your hands. And take a deep breath. - Mince meat pie! Your Grandma Ruth's favorite. - Nobody made mince meat pie like your grandmother Terence. - She always made it every Christmas. Thank you Cassie. - You're welcome. - I wish grandma were here. - You know what sweetie? In a way she is. She's all around us. - Did grandma like the Santa and Pete story? - She loved it and guess what? We're now coming to her favorite part. - Which part? - Where they come to the New World. [majestic instrumental music] It was a long, hard voyage across the Atlantic for Santa and Pete. On December 23rd, they set foot on the soil that today is New York City. [hooves clopping] - Look around you Petey. Wee, we're here! The New World! My heart's thumping like a jack rabbit. - You know what we gotta do Nick? - No, what? - Just this once, let's splurge. Let's get the biggest room in New Amsterdam. - Peter I'm surprised at you. - I know, I'm usually the one with the tight purse strings, but maybe we have to do something to celebrate. Wow! - I couldn't agree more. [instrumental music] - Wait a minute. Isn't that your coat? - Where? Oh, yes it is. - Why is she wearing it? - I gave it to her. - You gave it to her, why? - I grew fond of her and her children coming over on the voyage. I didn't want them to be cold. - Oh Nick, I can't believe you. You know, you gotta think of yourself sometimes. You know you're getting on in years and you can catch a death of a cold in this weather. - Peter, will you stop worrying about me? I'm as warm as toast. [clicking] - Wow, come on. [uplifting instrumental music] What are we stopping here for? - I want to get this ring to Miss Van Olden. - She's here? - No, but the Reverend usually knows everything that goes on in town. - Santa and Pete? [gasps] Oh I don't believe this! It really is you! I heard the rumors that you might be coming to New Amsterdam and I can't believe it, here you are. Oh, my name is Maria Dangola. - Pleased to meet you Maria. - What on Earth would bring you to New Amsterdam? - Mainly, we're here to see the children. - That, and to ensure that the tradition of gift giving is carried on here in the New World. - Well my children are gonna be so jealous when they hear that I met you. - Well, perhaps we'll see them tomorrow night when we do our rounds. - Oh they would love that! By the way, would you care to join us for our Christmas Eve feast? - That sounds absolutely wonderful. - Wonderful, that's sounds wonderful, but we can't see, that's the busiest night of the year for us. - Maria? - Janet, Janet, come here. Look who it is, Santa and Pete. This is my sister Janet. I was just inviting them to dinner tomorrow night. - Have you accepted the invitation? - What time would you like us? - [Maria] Say six o'clock? - We'll be there. - Wonderful, we live on the outskirts of town in a place called Harlem. Just ask of the Dangola family. - Thank you Maria, we'll see you tomorrow. - Okay, this is so exciting! I can't wait to tell the children! - What, what? - I thought we were too busy. - Well, I mean, I thought, you know. You didn't like the fruitcake, so I figured you wouldn't turn down a free meal. - I'm sure that's the only reason you wanted to go. [laughs] [slow instrumental music] [goat bleating] - No, no, how did you get in here? Those are decorations for the Christmas program. You can't eat those, out, out, out. Oh are you two here for the Christmas program? Out, out! Oh, we have everyone we need for the nativity, but yah, yah. Santa and Pete? Well, that's a wonderful idea. The children would love that. - Actually Reverend. - And you'd make a wonderful Santa. You're a dead ringer for him. - What about me? - Well, you're a passable Pete, but Santa here. - Passable? I am Pete. - You're not saying? - Exactly. - Oh my. - Hello Reverend Bogart. - Santa and Pete. What an honor that you would come to our colony. Oh, and your timing is perfect. The children could use a little inspiration right now. - Oh, why is that? - Oh well, it just doesn't feel much like Christmas this year. Life is so hectic here with all the faiths and cultures and so many people and more arriving every day. Families have been separated and not found each other. - Why that's terrible. - And then there's the unrest between the settlers and the Indians. - The Indians? - Yeah, there've been attacks on both sides, mostly over land. I heard yesterday the governor was planning an attack in retaliation for something. - I can't believe this. The New World's already sounding like the old one. - We were led to believe that we were coming to a land of peace and harmony. - Well, that was the dream St. Nicholas. And I guess you noticed how commercial everything's become. - Commercial? - Well, the establishment's put up the Christmas decorations a week ago. - That is getting a jump on things isn't it? - Excuse me Reverend, Peter, can I have the ring? - I don't have the ring. - Miss Van Olden's, I gave it to you. - No, I put it in your bag. - No, I remember, on board the ship. - No, we were on the ship and I gave it to you because I didn't want to be responsible for it. I told you that. This is so embarrassing. - You may have told me, but that's not. - Just looking for it. - Ah, ah, ah. [slow instrumental music] I'm sorry. We were asked to deliver this ring to an Elizabeth Van Olden. She wouldn't happen to be a member of your congregation would she? - Yes, yes she is. - Ah, do you know where she lives? - No, I believe she works at the tannery here in town though. - Thank you Reverend and a happy holiday to ya. - And to both of you as well. It was wonderful to see you. [goat bleating] Go, go, go, go! - Reverend? There's still time for the dream of a better way of life to become a reality. - I pray for that everyday St. Nicholas. [slow sad instrumental music] - Too busy to celebrate Christmas? Trouble between the settlers and the Indians? - Maybe we were meant to be here. We got a lot of work to do Peter. - Ah, but first we gotta find us a play to stay. - Not before we find Miss Van Olden. Love is patient but it shouldn't be kept waiting too long. [sloshing] - I know, I know, just like everyone else in town. Waiting till the last minute and want their boots repaired now! - Actually sir, we're here on other business. - We understand you have someone named Elizabeth Van Olden working here. - Not anymore. Didn't like working with hides. They made her squeamish. - Don't blame her. - Do you happen to know where she lives? - I do not. This town's grown so fast it's hard to keep track of anyone. - So I see. - By the way, you too are who I think you are why don't you leave some coal in my children's shoes? Ha! They haven't been good since they came to New Amsterdam. [soft instrumental music] - You want me to put coal in your children's shoes? - Yeah, that's what you do isn't it? - No, that's not what I do. I don't know where that rumor got started, but I do not put coal in children's shoes. And you know why? Because every child is basically good. They need to be encouraged, not told how bad they've been. So when you go hoem tonight from a long day's work and they're getting on your nerves, try giving them the biggest hug ever and tell them that you love them. You do that and I guarantee you, you and your children will be just fine. - Maybe I'll try that. - Wonderful, well, it was nice to meet you. I'm glad we had this chance to chat. And happy holidays to you. - Happy holidays to you too. - Nicely done Peter. - I've learned from the best. - Now, lets go book that room. - Oh I can't wait! A warm bath, a feather bed, after two months on that ship, it's gonna be paradise! Nothing! - Nothing? - I told them we've been every place in town. I asked him to double check his ledger. I cajoles, I pleaded, I even told him I was traveling with the famous St. Nick! - What did he say to that? - No room at the inn. - Sounds familiar. - But he did mention this other place outside of town, but I wasn't sure if-- - We'll take it. Well, hardly the best room in town is it? - That's not even the best barn in town. [clattering] Knew we shoulda let me bargain for this place. - I'm too tired to bargain. Besides which that man may have needed money more than we did. - Oh I doubt it. - Give freely Peter and you will enjoy abundance, trust me. You know, I think it's rather cozy in here. - If you don't mind a room with a view. - It's better than our accommodation coming over on the ship. - I can't argue with that. - So, here we are. Tell me Peter, what are your first impressions of this New World? - A little overwhelming. I wasn't expecting so many people. But frankly, I'm concerned that we're not gonna have enough gifts for the children. - I think we're gonna have just the right amount. - Let me ask you something Nick, why is it you're so positive about everything? - That's simple Peter. Being negative is no fun. [laughs] [hay rustling] - What was that? - What? - Shh! [slow instrumental music] It's okay, we're not gonna hurt you. Come on out, come on. - Pete? - Yes. - What's going on? - Santa and Pete! - Well obviously you know our names young lady. I think it's only fair that we should know yours. - Marlene. - Marlene, that's a pretty name. - Where are your parents Marlene? - I don't know. - Did you get lost? - No, I just fell asleep. - Fell asleep? - In the woods where were building our cabin. Mother and father said it was okay for me to lie down under a tree. When I woke up I couldn't find them. I don't like it here, I want to go back to Holland. - Don't worry, everything's gonna be fine. You'll feel better when we find your parents. - Can you, can you really find them? - We will. Now, that's a promise. - Thank you Santa. - Good night Marlene. - Good night Santa. - I'm gonna need a ledger to keep track of all these promises you keep handing out. First you tell Henry Rutgers we'll deliver his ring. Then you tell Marlene we'll find her parents. How do you plan we'll do all of this? - Don't worry Peter. We'll find Marlene's parents safe and sound. - What do you suppose happened to them? - They could have got lost. You heard what the Reverend said, people become separated and then can never find one another again. - Do you think the Indians might have anything to do with this? - I don't know but I suspect the governor knows. - So tomorrow we find Marlene's parents, visit all the children, pass out all their gifts, go to the governor. - Don't forget Miss Van Olden. - I suggest finding Miss Van Olden is a low priority Nick. - Miss Van Olden is very important Peter, very important. - Why? I don't... Wait a sec. You looked in The Book of Life didn't you? Come on Nick, level with me. Did you see their names in there together? Did Henry Rutgers marry Elizabether Van Olden? Is it fate that we're to deliver this ring to her? - The Book of Life is not written in stone Peter. That's the great beauty of it. Everybody writes their own story. [slow instrumental music] [holiday music] [clattering] - Look what we have here. Look at that. Nick you can ride more comfortably in the New World. - In this? It's nothing but a piece of junk. - Oh, no, no, no. One man's junk is another man's treasure. We can fix it up. - I prefer riding my horse. It's become a tradition. - Well maybe it's time for a change huh? - I like tradition. - Your chariot awaits you my lady. - I'm hungry. - Oh wait a minute, I got something that'll tide you over till breakfast. - What is it? - Dried fruit, a Pete special. - No thanks. - Fine, be that way. - You mean you're not even gonna offer her the fruitcake? - No, I'm not even gonna mention the fruit cake. [laughing] Oh fine, go ahead and laugh. We men of vision are used to be ridiculed. Ya, ya! [upbeat instrumental music] [tapping] [door knocks] - Good morning. - Good morning. - [Santa] We'd like to see the governor please, it's important. - [Woman] I'm sorry, the governor is having his breakfast. - [Santa] Oh. - I'm the the governor! - Good morning sir. - Would you like a cup of cocoa? - Go ahead. - What can I do for you? - We understand that there's considerable tension between the settlers and the Indians. - Well, it's not exactly a secret. What did you do, just get off the boat? [laughs] - Actually, we did. - There's even a rumor to the effect that you're planning an attack. - Even if I were considering such a thing I wouldn't tell you. Who do you think you are anyway? - My name is Nicholas. This is my partner Peter. The little girl is Marlene, daughter of two of the settlers who seem to have disappeared. - Do you think the Indians might have anything to do with this? - Yes, I'm sure of it. All the more reason for a retaliation. - Well, I'd like to propose that Peter and I go to the Indians, talk to them, see if we can find a peaceful solution to the problem. [laughs] - For one thing you'd have to find them first. They're always moving from one place to another. And if you did find them, we'd never hear from you again. - And why is that? - These Indians are savages, not to be reasoned with or trusted. - There's some good in every man Governor. May I suggest that you reconsider your thinking, or at least postpone action until after the holidays? - I'm the leader of this colony and I will do what I think is appropriate! [burps] Now if you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of my breakfast. - Do think about it Governor. - Thank you for the cocoa. - You're very welcome. - Was the governor a nice man? - Well... - The word nice doesn't do him justice. - Well, does he know where my parents are? - Not exactly, but they did give us a good idea where to look. - I remember you said you were hungry. Me too, let's go have some breakfast. Everything always looks brighter on a full stomach. [ominous music] [laughing and chatting] - A full stomach is one thing Nick, but you're gonna put on 200 pounds in one day if you're not careful. - I don't think I have much to be scared of there. [low chattering] Excuse me a minute. - What are you doing? Going back for thirds? [laughing] - Can I take these carrots to feed the horses? - Yes, I think they would like that very much. [plucky instrumental music] - What on earth? - I traded it a few chocolates and my old hat for it. You know, everybody here is in love with chocolate and there's none to be had. - Well it looks like you got the short end of the stick on that deal. - You don't like it? - It's just, it's... - It's different. - Different, yeah. - It is New Worldish. - Santa and Pete the horses are gone! [sweet instrumental music] See? Look, there's a note! - Dear sir, we have borrowed your horses for the soldiers. This pack animal is a temporary replacement. Signed the governor. - They took our horses? - Don't worry Nick we're gonna get them back. - But my horse has been with me every Christmas since I can remember. - I know but this is the New World. We can start some new traditions. Besides, look at this face. Isn't this a face you could learn to love? - I like her. - So do I. [babbling noises] [upbeat instrumental music] So, what do you think about the reindeer now? - I still prefer my horse. [clanking] - How would you like to put this around our reindeer's neck? - Yeah! - What do you write in those messages anyway? - It differs from child to child. I want each and every one of them to feel that God knows them individually. - And that the child too might grow from knowing God. - That's right Peter! [Marlene giggling] - [Marlene] Come over here, I want to put this bell on you. Come on! - You're worried about Marlene's parents aren't you? - I'm concerned for everyone involved. - Peter, I believe in my heart of hearts that Marlene's parents have not been harmed. And I think I know how to find them. Tonight, after we've had dinner with the Dangola's. - After we've had dinner. - We ride out into the forest. - We ride into the forest. - And let the Indians find us. - And let the Indians find, wait a minute! That's crazy! - No. I think it'll work. - Okay, I'm willing to try it if you are. But you know, with everything going on around here, giving out chocolates and the toys to the children, seems almost incidental. - Peter, I've seen a lot through my life. Wars, famine, people's dreams being dashed for one reason or another and through it all I've given thanks that I was the patron saint of children. They are the ray of hope through our darkness. That's why we celebrate them on Christmas eve. After all, Christmas started with a child didn't it? - Yes it did. - And you know what? We'll get everything done. If you have to work all night, we'll deliver the presents to the children. - That's it! That's it, that's the idea! - What? - Well, we'll deliver the gifts to the children at night while they're sleeping! - Would be more of a surprise in the morning wouldn't it? - And more efficient. - Peter? I think you're on to something here. - It's easy to think when you don't have a dead racoon sitting on your head. - Ah. - Let me give you an idea how long ago this story took place. When St. Nick and Pete first came here, this whole neighborhood was nothing but a big field and right in the middle, two windmills. Broadway was a dirt road. Harlem was a small village. In the in trails ran hither and yon. It was really an exciting time actually. Of course it was a hard time too and people didn't have what we have today in the material sense. Children didn't get as many presents. But see, it didn't really matter. The spirit of Christmas, that's what really mattered and it was that spirit that Santa and Pete carried with them on the first Christmas eve in the New World. - We don't have much. - Give freely Peter. - I know, I know, and enjoy abundance. - Exactly. - I can't believe I'm with Santa and Pete on Christmas eve. - Well, you better start Marlene because believing is what Christmas is all about. - Well, will you look at that. Seems our deer is quite a vixen. - You know, that's a good name for her. - What's a vixen? - Yes, I think I'm gonna let Peter explain that to you. - Me, wait a second, you said that you would tell it. [light instrumental music] Let's see, a vixen is a lady who is very popular with the gentlemen. [bells clanging] - What are the reindeer's names? - They don't have any. - They should all have one, aye Marlene? Why don't you start? - Okay, that one in the front, the big one, Comet. - That's a great name. How'd you come up with that one Marlene? - Well, my father and I saw a comet the first night we were in New Amsterdam. He said it was good luck. [swift instrumental music] - Comet it is. - Your turn. - Dasher, for that fast one there. - I like that. - He looks like a race horse you know, dashing to the finish line. - One more. - Okay it's my turn. I'll name the last reindeer Cupid. - Cupid? - Why Cupid? - Because I believe in the unifying power of love. - On Dasher! - On Cupid! - On Comet! - And Vixen! [swift instrumental music] - [Maria] Santa and Pete! - [Santa] Maria good evening! - Oh wait. - Look who's here! Come in, come in. Let me introduce everyone. This is my husband Big Manuel. - Good evening. - Santa. Pete. - And our children, little Manuel and Julia. - It's very nice to meet you all. - And this is Marlene. - Hello. - Well hello Marlene, welcome to our house! Everyone, please make yourself at home. - I thought the real Santa and Pete had a big bag with gifts in it. - Julia! [laughing] - Right you are Julia. I'll be right back. - Do you think the horses could use a drink of water? - Actually, it's reindeer now Janet. - Reindeer? - Yes, reindeer and I'm sure they'd love a drink of water. - I think Janet is especially pleased that you and Pete came to New Amsterdam. [giggling] [reindeer grunting] [sweet instrumental music] - Reindeer. I thought the reindeer could use. - Let me get that for you. It's a nice night. - Yes it is. So, Janet, how long have you been here in the New World? - About a year. - Why did you come? - Things weren't going very well for me back in Holland. I decided I needed a new start. - And did you get a new start? - Yes, yes I have. It's not perfect here, but it is exciting. Oh, I think this New World is full of great possibilities. - You might be right. - You see, I have all these dreams. - Such as? - I want to be a teacher. - Oh, I think that's a wonderful dream to have! - You do? - Yes, yes I do. And like Nick always says, the children are our future. [both laughing] - So tell me, how long will you be here in New Amsterdam? - Nick wants to get home pretty soon. - But you've just arrived. - I know. - Do you want to leave so soon? - I pretty much go wherever Nick goes. - Tell me, what's it like traveling with the famous St. Nick? - Oh, it's wonderful! It's demanding and inspiring. Because of him, I know that dreams can come true. [sweet instrumental music] Uh, we better get back inside. We don't want to keep the children waiting. Got a, had a bag, the bag, let's get the bag. - This is for Julia! - Yes! Chocolate! - [Marlene] Great Julia! - There's something else in there Julia. See what it is. - [Marlene] What is it? - It's saying something momma. - To some they are rags, to you a doll. If you miss Lizzie? Look behind the mill wall. Walk in faith. - Let's go see, come on! - How did you know that Julia had a doll named Lizzie Santa? - Nick knows a lot of things about a lot of people. And this is for you Little Manuel. - Momma, momma, Santa was right! Lizzie was behind the mill wall! - All right children, you could stay up a little longer and then it's bedtime. - Oh, can Marlene stay with us until her parents come back? - Would you like to stay with us Marlene? We sure would love to have you. - I think that would be wonderful. - Go ahead, put it in. [slapping and giggling] I love sugar cookies, this is great. - You've made this evening so special St. Nick, thank you. - There's one more thing I might do for you Maria. I know you're concerned about your baby. - Well, yes. We lost the last one and this one is-- - Three weeks late. This is for your baby. [rattling] - Nathaniel Paul Dangola. That's the name we chose, if it's a boy. - He'll grow up to be a strong, healthy young man. [sweet instrumental music] - Thank you Santa. [laughing] [reindeer grunting] [Janet and Peter laughing] - Peter! - I'm ready, let's go. - Where's the bag? - Oh wait. The bag. The bag. - You're driving. - I know. - Thank you for a wonderful evening and a merry Christmas to all. - And to you a good night. [uplifting instrumental music] [bells clattering] - A merry Christmas to all and to all a good night. I like the sound of that. Peter. - Whoa Vixen, whoa Vixen, stop! [ominous instrumental music] This was your idea Nick. I'm gonna let you handle it. - It is the man with the white beard. We have waited a long time for your return. - I'm sorry sir, but I think you have mistaken me for someone else. - Come, join us. Your legend has been passed down through several generations. A man with a white beard came to the Indians. It was a good time for our people. Crops were plentiful. There was peace between all the tribes. There must be a reason that you have returned. - Actually, there is. We have heard that you may have taken a couple of the settlers, a man and a woman. These two have a daughter who misses them very much. This is Christmas eve, she could receive no more wonderful present than to be reunited with her parents. - You bring a message of peace? - I do, for the sake of all our children. - You have delivered the same message to the settlers? - I promise you this, I personally will deliver this message to the governor of New Amsterdam. - It is good that you have come. - I'm glad that we did. And now, before we leave, these are for the children. - We also have a gift for you. [slow native style instrumental music] - This is beautiful, thank you, thank you. - It took two full moons to find the reddest of berries to dye this coat. - This is perfect! In honor of this occasion, I will wear this coat every Christmas eve. - The Indians knew about a man with a white beard? - They have a prophecy that such a man would come to them flying through the air. - You know dad, what I loved about this story, is that is has a mix of all cultures. - That's why I love telling it. - And this is a Dutch legend? - Yes it is and it takes in to account the fact that people throughout the ages have failed to bridge the gap between all the different cultures. - And that's why Santa and Peter are so important. - Yes, love, forgiveness, friendship, and a playful sense of humor. Those are the real gifts that Santa and Pete brought to the New World and they had faith that they could make a difference. - Grandpa, what's faith? - Well, it's that thing inside that you hold on to until help arrives. - I knew that would work out. As soon as we got there, I thought no problem. Except we still don't have Marlene's parents. - We've done all we could do for now. You can't force the Indians or the governor to do something they don't really want to do. [reindeer grunting] - Hya, Hya! [swift instrumental music] - What on Earth's got into these reindeer? - I don't know, it's like they're possessed or something. - Janet? Is this the bucket you used for those reindeer? - Yes, why? Oh my, that's not the one with Maria's special Christmas concoction in it? - I'm afraid so. - Her secret African recipe. - The one with the big kick. - Well, I know what it does to humans. But what does it do to reindeer? [fast paced instrumental music] - Stop the carriage! - I can't! - You just don't want me to get my hat back! - No, it's not that. I really can't stop these animals. [grunts] Whatever's happened to this team, they certainly got the spirit. [reindeer grunting] - Reindeer. Well, would you look at this. Someone's left gifts for us! - This must be where the man from the tannery lives. - How very kind of him. - Not only kind, but well needed Nick. You could use a change, you know, you been wearing the same style clothes for about what, 400 years now? - Oh you're a great one to talk. It's a good thing the Indians gave you that jerkin. - Hey, I have my own sense of style. My wardrobe will never go out of fashion. [slow instrumental music] - I'm gonna have a whole new look. [upbeat instrumental music] [bells jangling] - Whoa, whoa. Last stop, Governor's house. - It was a good night Peter - This bag is as heavy as it was when we started. I sure didn't think we'd have enough presents. Where are the shoes? The children are gonna be disappointed in the morning. - No, we've got to get in. It's important. Locked. They must be afraid of the Indians. - Well, if you want to get inside, all you gotta do is knock. - I don't want to wake them. - What do you suppose we do? Go down the chimney? [playful instrumental music] [coughing] [grunting] You okay? [coughing] - Couldn't see very well in there. - You need to work on your entrance Nick. - Where's my bag? - Santa and Pete! - Shh! - Look, I can explain everything. You see, the shoes were supposed to be outside and they weren't. So he looked up and then the chimney. Could you just get us the children's wooden shoes please? - The children stopped wearing their wooden shoes when they came to New Amsterdam. - No wooden shoes? - How bout stockings? - Stockings? Looks kinda funny to me. - No it doesn't. - I have to think about this one. - You could think about it all you want, trust me. This, this one's a keeper. - I thought you might be hungry. How bout some cookies and milk? - Oh, that's so nice of you. - Now you mention it, I am hungry. - I'd like you to have this too Santa. I must admit, I made it for someone else, but it does not look like he will be coming to New Amsterdam. I hope you like it. [slow instrumental music] - You say you made it for someone else? - Yes. - What is your name? - Elizabeth. - Van Olden? - Yes. [slow instrumental music] - This is for you. - Oh. - Henry Rutgers asked us to deliver it to you. - He loves you very much. He'll join you here just as soon as it's possible. He wants to marry you Elizabeth. - Oh thank you Santa, thank you so much! [giggles] Please, keep the hat. - Well, thank you. - It definitely goes better with the coat Nick. - Quite smashing, it is you. - Oh yes! [laughing] - Have you ever seen someone so happy Nick? - I think it's the best Christmas present we've ever delivered. - Okay, so now you can tell me, did Henry Rutgers and Elizabeth Van Olden marry in The Book of Life. - They do now. [slow instrumental music] - You know the last stop of the night and the first Christmas eve in the New World was Santa and Pete. - What about Marlene? - Well, I didn't say that was the end of the story. - Remember the promise that Santa made to the Indians? Well, before he left the governor's house, he wrote him a letter and he explained how he had visited with the Indians and how he felt there could be peace between them and the settlers. - Peace on Earth, good will toward men. - That was Santa's Christmas message. [uplifting instrumental music] - Let me ask you something. If I were to look in the Book of Life and found my name, would I remember what I seen? - No you wouldn't. But I'll tell you this. If I get on a boat this week to sail back to Holland, you're not with me I'll understand. - Oh, I'd call that jumping to conclusions. I only meet Janet tonight. - So you were thinking about her. - Of course I was, she's a wonderful woman. I've never met anyone like her. - So stick around for a while. See what happens. - What are you trying to get rid of me? - Don't tell me you haven't been thinking about settling down. You'd made a wonderful husband and father. I've never seen anybody who is better with children. And remember Peter, there's no higher calling than being a parent. - What about you? When are you gonna get married and settle down? - Me, married? Ha can you picture that? - Absolutely, I can. Mrs. St. Nick. - I'm on the road too much to marry. - Well, you can't be on the road forever. And besides, you talked about cutting back on traveling. - That's true. Perhaps if I were to meet Mrs. Right I'd settle down and move up north. - Hey wait a second. Did you ever look your name up in The Book of Life? - My name's not in there. - It's not? - The one name that's a complete mystery to me is my own and I wouldn't have it any other way. [sweet slow instrumental music] - [Pete] Whoa, whoa, Vixen, whoa. - Marlene's parents? [slow sad instrumental music] The last thing I want to see on Christmas eve is a sad little girl. - You said you'd find them Santa. You promised. - I did indeed. Go to the window, look outside. [slow instrumental music] - I don't see anything. - Outside, look again. - Mother, father! I knew you'd find em! Pete they're here! [uplifting instrumental music] - You knew they were coming didn't you? - I had a hunch. - You're good Nick, you're very good. - [Marlene] Mother, father! [sighs] I missed you so much. [instrumental music] - Thank you so much. - Yes, thank you Santa. - Bye bye dear. - Yes, the Lord does work in mysterious ways. - Let's go partner. - [Pete] Looks like Vixens' got more company Nick. - Five, six, I draw the line at eight. - Well, I'll tell you one thing, even with six reindeer, there's no way you're going in that carriage tonight. - I'm afraid she's right Nick. With all this snow I think we're stuck. - [Maria] You could stay with us. - We really must be on our way tonight Maria. - I might be able to help you out. I'm known as quite a handy man in these parts. [fast paced instrumental music] [tapping] - You're a magician Manuel. - No, that would be you Santa. I'm just good at fixing things. - Can't you stay a little while Santa? - Time for me to go home Maria. - What about Pete? - I can't speak for him. - So you just came back to check on Marlene? - Not just that. I also wanted to tell you that we'll be back again, next year. I sense that I still have important work to do with Nick and I sense that you have important work to do. - Do you really? - Absolutely. And I think you'll make a wonderful teacher. - Thank you. - Well, I'll see you next year? - Yes, you will. [sweet instrumental music] - You did a great job Big Manuel! - Only the best for Santa and Pete. Oh, by the way, how did the reindeer behave this evening? - They were a little rambunctious. - Just be sure to keep tight hold on the reigns. - Believe me, I will. - I do believe this is the best Christmas I've ever had. - Oh, it certainly has been for us too Santa. - Take care of yourselves. - You sure this is what you want? - I don't have a choice. Besides, if I'm meant to have a family, settle down, I believe it will happen. - I believe it will too Peter. - By the way, why did Big Manuel ask about the reindeer? [playful instrumental music] - I wonder. - Yah, yah! - Bye bye! [climactic instrumental music] - We're flying! Merry Christmas! [laughing] [bells jangling] - That's a great story Grandpa! - Dad it gets better every time you tell it. - My favorite part is when they go flying off in the end. - Oh, you know my favorite part was when Big Manuel tells the kids it's time to go to bed. - Aw Dad, can I stay up just a little longer please? - 'Fraid not son, besides, Santa and Pete could be here at any moment. - Wait a minute, how they gonna know I'm here? - Santa knows a lot of things about a lot of people remember. - Come on son, let's go. - Goodnight Grandpa. - I'll be up in a little bit sweetie. You know what Dad, I remember the first time I heard that story. I was just as excited as Terence. - You were? - You know what else? I remember how special Christmas was in this house. All the decorations and the smells. [slow instrumental music] All the love. - I'm glad the spirit of Christmas is back in this house. Your momma would be pleased. [sweet instrumental music] [bells jingling] - Wow! Wow. Hey, that's me. Mom, Dad, Grandpa. Pete. Grandpa! - What's going on Terence? - You have to see this! - See what? - Where'd it go? - Where'd what go? - It was right here. - What was right here? - I saw The Book of Life. It was right there. I'm serious. I saw my name and Mom and Dad's and yous. When I traced all the names back to the beginning, that's funny, I can't remember. - You really got into that story didn't you Terence. - I saw it Grandpa. - You know, I believe that you're the one person in every generation who's the keeper of the family history and it's his honor and his responsibility to pass it on. - Do you think that someone might be me? - Yes I do. - Dad? - Is everything all right? - Everything's just fine. [majestic instrumental music] There's an old African belief that as long as there's someone alive to call your name, you'll never die. We count Pete among our ancestors and we call out his name every Christmas. In this way, he and Santa continue to share their message of peace and joy and family and faith to anyone who will listen. [uplifting instrumental music] - On Dancer! - On Cupid! - On Comet! [laughing] [Santa] Merry Christmas!
