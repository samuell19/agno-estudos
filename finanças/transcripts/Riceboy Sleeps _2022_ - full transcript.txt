It's so nice to meet everybody. Did you guys have a great summer? Yeah. Yes. -Good, me too. I'm Miss Jane, I'm gonna be your grade one teacher for this year. -Cool! -Yeah, and then we're... Hi there! Welcome back. Do you want to come and join us? You can just take a seat right here. There's an open desk.

I know your sister. -Ashley Davis? -Here. -Nice bow! -Thank you. -You're welcome. -Sarah James? -Here. -Hi, Sarah. -Dong-hyun... Kim? Uh, Dong? Is, is your name Dong...hyun? Or is it Kim? Is it Kim? - No, no, that's... No, that's bad. It's, it's good, though. -Okay, okay, I can't be talking about this at work... -Jody's fine, man. Fuckin' stop that. -My wife is... -Ew, what is that? -What's he eating? -What is it? -Smells like farts. Gross. -Is that rice in there? What's the yellow stuff? -What does it taste like? -Is he eating rice for lunch? That's so weird. - I dare you to try it. - Children. -No way! Back to your seats, please. -Gross! Don't. -Come on. Eat it. No running. Back and forth, back and forth... The second I tell him he's got a deal, he doesn't wanna sell me the Harley anymore. Says I'm not, maybe, a qualified buyer. -No fuckin' way. -Way. Move. -You're getting a bike still though, right? -You know what? I think my feelings are hurt. -Don't get a fucking boat. I swear to god, man. -Have you seen what you get on a boat? Alright? They're not wearing leather suits, they are wearing bikinis. Sitting on the bow, little bit of champagne... -Models. -Drop the anchor. -Yeah. -You. If you touch me again, I will kill you. -Take it easy, little lady. -No! You don't touch me, understand? Let's go! Come on, find Mom and Dad. Have a good day! -Let's go. -See you, Ashley. -Finally! -I know, we'll see you tomorrow! Bye! See you guys. Over this way. Good work. -Mrs. Kim? Mrs. Kim, hi. I'm Miss Jane. Can I have a word? -Uh, yes. -Here are a list of names that I think would suit him well. Have a look, think about it and then let us know once you've made your choice. I personally like David best. -Michael Jordan! Learn how to fucking drive. -No, no. I told you this already. Look. This is the wrong way. It's upside down. Look, you gotta flip this around. You speak English? Then you gotta, you gotta flip this around. Look, if you put it in this way, they're gonna get it to the factory, they're gonna put it in the wrong way. -Hey, Stuart. Can I play too? -Ha! You're it! -You can't catch me! -I got you! -Tag! -Get him, Jimmy! Get him! -Hey! Rice boy. Loser. -Give it back! -Tag! -Ha, Rice boy! -Give me back my glasses! -Rice boy's a loser. - Rice boy! Rice boy! -Rice boy! Rice boy! Rice boy! -Don't call me that. Agh! You can't get us! -Do you know Tae-Kwon-Do? Don't let him come up. -So-young Kim? -So-young Kim? -Why the other kids not in trouble? They be racist to him every day. Teasing him, the funny face, and- -Mrs. Kim, please. I think it's a bit extreme to refer to the children's actions as racist. -No, no! This is racism. -Excuse me? -This, right now. This is racism. -I'm sorry, do you mean to say- Are you suggesting that I'm- -Yes! Yes. Why only me mom here? Why no other moms here too? -Because your son punched a little girl. -It was accident! Not to mention the other two boys that he hit. -Children are supposed to hit and fight. -No. No, they're not. -He cannot do nothing. He has to fight for himself. -Mrs. Kim, we cannot teach our kids to fight, to, to use violence to resolve conflict. No. I'm sorry, but no. Now, the other parents are very upset about what's happened. -I'm upset. I'm upset too. -Of course, I understand that. Everyone is upset with the situation, with what's happened. And so, what I'm trying to do is handle this in a fair and just manner so that this sort of incident doesn't occur again. -Are you hearing me? -What's going on in there? -It's the oriental boy's mother. -Ah. -Sus... -Suspending. -Suspending. What is suspending? -He's to not come to school for one week. -What does he do? -He'll be assigned his homework and expected to finish it on his own time. -Where does he go? -That will be for you and your husband to decide. -I don't have... It's just me. I work every day so he cannot be home by himself all the time. -I'm sorry, but I can't help you with that. -What about the other boys? -What about them? -They suspend too? -No. -The other parents want David to be expelled, but I don't feel that's- -I'm sorry about all of this, really. The bottom line is this, acts of physical violence cannot- -What about emotional violence? My son hurts more every day than how the other boys hurts now. But he's the only one who punished? -I'm sorry you feel that way. -Sorry? Sorry, sorry! You keep saying sorry, but you're not sorry. You not sorry even a little bit. -I have higher standards than that. Higher standards. And I was so excited, then she walks in, and the smell just... -I gotta good one. -Okay, go. -So I go up to my girlfriend and I say, "wow, baby, you've got a big pussy. Wow, you've got a big pussy." -Is that the joke? -Echo. Oh... -Maya Angelou once said, "I have a great respect for the past, "because if you don't know where you've come from, "you don't know where you're going." Yeah. -Who is Maya Angelou? Are you kidding me? Steph, help me out. -Is she related to D'Angelo? Wow, you guys. No, I'm pretty confident they are not related. Harry? Buddy, I can see the crumbs all over your face from here, man. Let's put that away and focus, okay? Maya Angelou is a great African American musician, writer, activist, dancer. And I bring up her quote to preface your next assignment. I want you all to build a family tree. Now, I know a lot of you might have done this in elementary school where you draw a picture of a tree and you say the names of family members under each branch. So, I want you to take that concept but in this instance I want you to use it to learn something about your family's history. Okay. For example, the origin of your family's ancestry. Or, the type of work your family did, or maybe the struggles and the challenges that your family experienced. It's all up to you. Korea. Korea. Do you want it on a poster board? Sure, it can totally be on poster board. But it can be anything, it can be a collage, it can be a slideshow. I had a student make a short film once. It's up to you, however you guys feel best about this, it works for me, okay? However, please note. Please, note. Part of your grading will be based on the creativity of your presentation. So guys, please, please, please put some thought and effort into this. Fuck off, asshole. -Is there something y'all want to share with the rest of the class? No, sir. I'm sorry. -No? Alright, let's cut it out and settle down to focus, please. Guys, guys, guys. This is a wonderful, wonderful opportunity... - "Fuck off, asshole." For you to get to know about your past, about your family and in turn about yourselves. Take advantage of this. Don't waste it. It's my hope that at the end of all of this we will all get to know each other a little better and a little deeper than we did before. Alright, get your minds out of the gutter. Any questions? -How deep? Any other questions? -So what do you want me to do about this? -I should talk to the people upstairs. -Maybe you should. -Okay, I don't know why you're screaming at me. I didn't do this. This is not my fault. -You make it so hard for me. You make me not want to be your friend. -I'll take care of you next time. -Thanks. -Hi, what is this? How are you doing? -I'm good. How are you? -Good, good. -You look tired. -I'm a little bit tired, yeah. -Simon, Simon, come! -What is... what is all this? Are you having a party out here? That's for me? Oh, wow. Thank you. What is this? -It's horchata. -Horchata. Mmmm. -Simon! -Oh, I want to, but I can't. -Simon, come on! We gotta move the van, man. I know, I hear you. Just relax, Doyle. Okay, I gotta go, but good to see everyone, have fun. And I'll see you tonight? -Yes, yes. Would you come for dinner? -Oh, I don't think I can make it in time. Don't wait for me. -Teacher say I should change my son name, so we thinking of calling him Richard. -Oh, that's my son's name. -Your son? Why your son name Richard? -Oh, I'm sorry. -Maybe we go with Stanley then. -I like Stanley too. -Stanley is my husband's name. -Your husband name is Stanley? Your husband name is Stanley Park? -We didn't know. -How about David? -Oh, no, no, no. David is my son's name. -Okay, last one. Kevin? Anyone have Kevin? -Oh, si, si, my building manager, his name is Kevin. -It's good. Kevin, it's good. -Yeah, no problem. -You think Kevin a good name? -It's good, it's good. Like Kevin Costner. -Very clean, simple. Easy to say. -Kevin Costner? -"The Bodyguard"? You don't know? The movie with Whitney Houston. -Guapo, guapo, handsome. -Kevin is a good name. -Okay. -Yeah. Very good. -Okay? -Si? -Okay! My son is Kevin! -Just leave it alone, I'll put it away. Leave it! Give it back! Give it back! Leave me alone! God! Get out of my room! Get out of my room! Get out of my room! Get out! -It's not what you think. -Do you think your mom is stupid or something? -Do you hear me? Don't do it. -Okay. -Mom, can I ask you something? -What is it? -Can you tell me about my dad? Mom? -I don't want to talk about... -Can you tell me what he was like? Was he nice? Was he smart? -When? -I'm too tired right now. -Did he even know about me? -Why won't you ever tell me anything about him? -Hey, Simon. -David, how're you doing, pal? -Good. -Yeah, take those. I got some apples. -Alright. -Hi, Simon. -Oh, hi! -Hi. -I got the rice. -Oh, thank you. -This is the brand you wanted, right? -Yes, yes. Thank you. -Oh, my gosh. Smells amazing in here. -Where should I put this? -Over here. -Looks like this is fine? -It's good, thank you. -Oh, man. Is this tofu? What is this? -It's tteokbokki. Are you hungry? -I am so hungry. -Okay. -How are things at school? -Good, good. -Good. How are you liking Mrs. Lee? She's... -Oh, thank you. She's one of your teachers this semester, right? -Apparently she's sick or something, so we've had a sub for the past week. -Oh, she's sick. That's not good. I should give her a call. Well, thank you for this. This looks amazing. How's your back doing? -About same. -Well, what time's your appointment tomorrow? I'll try and go with you. -It's okay. -No, no, I really think I should go with you this time- -You're busy. You're busy. -No, I'll make the time. It's fine. Jeez, I mean, it's getting ridiculous how long it's been... -Eat. Eat first, we can talk about it later, okay? See you later Simon. -Oh, hey, David, one sec. So, someone gave me a couple of tickets to the Canucks opener this Friday and so I was thinking, you, me, get some churros, eat some nachos with that scary yellow cheese on it. What do you say? -Uh... I don't really like hockey all that much, so... -Have you been to a game before, like in person? -No. -Well, honestly, I'm not a big fan of hockey either but when it's live? When it's live it's a good time, seriously. -Sounds fun, you should go. -I have plans on Friday, so... -Oh, well... -Oh, you do? -If you already have plans then... But if you change your mind you let me know? Okay? 'Cause the ticket's yours if you want it. -Okay. -It's okay. It's okay. -Good? -Mhm. -It's okay, just sit. -I can help. -Oh, no, no, no. Don't do it. -It's fine. I'm capable of doing the dishes. -No, leave it. Leave it. Leave it. -No, I can do it. -You guest, stop. I do it. -Okay. Okay, okay, fine. Rock, paper, scissors. Winner does the dishes, the loser has to give the winner a kiss, okay? Come on, okay? Ready? Rock, paper, scissors. -Did you say something? -Oh, nothing. It's yours. -Thank you. So... before I go, I wanted to ask you something. Um, I've been thinking about this for a while now. You know, I really like spending time with you and being here and eating with you and spending time with David and I was thinking that maybe, um, what if we moved in together? Like, live together. You and David and me. -Um... Live together? -Yeah, you could move into my place or we could find a new place altogether. Whatever you want. What do you think? -What's going on? -Simon proposed to So-young. -What's going on? -So-young is getting married! -No, I'm not. I'm not. I don't know yet. -You don't know? You don't know what? -Why? Simon is so handsome and nice. -It's... I don't know, it's difficult. -Don't think too much. Listen to your heart. Your heart knows best. -Okay, okay. I have to go. I have to go. -See you tomorrow! -Bye. -She's getting married. -Who? -So-young! -You sure your brother won't be mad? -Dude, he won't even notice it's gone. It's been here for a few months. -Look at that. -Looks like toasted shit. -Yeah, your mouthful's gonna be... -Smells like your mom. -Fuck you. Fucking asshole. -So, how many do I have to eat? -I don't know, just keep eating till you're high, I guess. -Oh, shit. -This is the worst tasting brownie ever. -I don't know how much of this I can actually eat. -Just try and eat a bit more. -I don't know. This is really terrible. -Alright. -What are you doing? -Oh, yeah, baby. More? -I don't know. -More? -Put the whole fucking thing in. -Fuck you. No help. Here I go. Oh, yeah. Look at that. Look at that. Get out of here, fly. Fuck that guy. Look. -A little more, a little more. -Okay, okay. -There we go. -There we go. That's gonna be perfect. -So-young. -Oh hi, how are you? -Very good, and yourself? -I'm good, fine. Thank you. -Nice to see you. -Yeah. How was your trip? -There is no easy way to say this, Miss Kim. You have stage four pancreatic cancer. It is what we were most concerned with. -Uh, what? -The CT scans have revealed that you have cancer in your pancreas. -Sorry, sorry. Could you speak slower. -Yes, of course. You have cancer in your pancreas. And it has spread to your liver and your lungs. -I have cancer? -Yes. -I don't understand. I just have back problems. -You have a tumor at the tip of your pancreas which is pushing up against your spine. -Uh, sorry, sorry. What did you say? Pan... pan... -Pancreas. Yes. -Could you spell that? -Sure. P. Here, let me help you with that. -Sorry. -It's okay, there you go. -Thank you. -P. -P. -A. -A. -N. -N. -C-R-E. -E. -Yes. A. -A. -S. -S. Okay. -It's a large gland that's tucked behind your stomach. It produces a type of enzyme or hormone which helps you break down food. -Uh, okay. Okay. -Now, the pancreatic cancer on its own is one thing, but the problem here, the real problem here, Miss Kim is that it has spread to other areas of your body. -Spread? -Yes. To your liver and your lungs. -Okay. Spread. -Which is common with pancreatic cancers. There's no obvious symptoms initially. You might have had this for quite some time, you just didn't know it. -Okay. So, what do I do? -There are treatments to help you prolong and improve your quality of life. -Like, chemotherapy? -Yes, chemotherapy. But, you must understand the severity of the situation, Miss Kim. Although we can provide treatment and medications to ease the pain and discomfort, we cannot cure you of this cancer. -What does that mean? -This is terminal. -Terminal. -Okay, terminal. T. Terminal... -Miss Kim? Miss Kim? Miss Kim? -Uh, yes? -You will die from this. -You feel anything yet? -You mean, like, from the brownies? -Yeah. -Not really, no. You? -No. -Fuck. -Maybe we shouldn't have put them in the milkshake. I wonder if they just lose their potency at certain temperatures. You know what I mean? -Maybe. They also tasted hella old. -True, true. But, you know, do pot brownies have expiration dates? -They must. Hey, have you done that, that family tree thing yet? -I think my brother's got one made from a few years back, so I'll probably just use that and bullshit some stories to go along with it. -Cool. Cool. -Fuck. -You alright? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Is it something bad? -I just get like this sometimes if I eat milk products. -I see you eating ice cream all the time, you fucking idiot. -Yeah, and I shit my pants all the time, so fuck you. It's gross, all you see is the back of the dude's nuts. Unless that's something you're into. -No thanks. -Fag! -Nope. -Did you see that like tank top thing Ashley was wearing today? That girl has got some nice titties. They're like... Fuck, I had to tug one off in the toilet stall - - during woodwork. No joke. So, when are you gonna grow some balls and ask her out? You should try and hook up with her at the party. For real. Why? I thought you were like in love with her. -Like a million years ago. -More like a week ago. -What the fuck are you talking about? -I see you sitting there all the fucking time, staring at her with your little boner. -Shut the fuck up. -Ashley, Ashley, I love you. I love you so much. I wanna marry you. Oh, I wanna stick my dick in you. -Oh, fuck. -Oh. fuck. -You're such an idiot. -Oh, fuck. -You good? -Get the fuck away. -Dude, I think I shit myself. Shit! -Fucking gross. -Fuck you! -I've had it for a while. Simon? -He's alright, I guess. I don't know. -Like adoption? What do you think? -I don't know. -What don't you know? -I don't know... -I never said that. -But would you? -I don't care, just do whatever. Do whatever makes you happy. -I'm happy if you're happy. -What? Why are you putting this on me? I don't want anything. If you want to stop seeing him, then stop seeing him. Or if you want to marry him, go ahead and marry him. I don't care. -I'm getting up. -I wasn't even hungry! The food tastes like shit. -Can I go now? -Don't hit me. Don't hit me! -I said don't hit me! Cancer in pancreas. -Is it serious? -It spread to different part of my body, the doctors said. -What's wrong? -Is she okay? ... The Canadian Pacific Railway... - Hey... ...it was much cheaper and much faster to bring- Turn around, Korea. Korea, I got a surprise for you. Sorry I'm late. -Now, since the beginning of the railroad's construction... -Korea! -Dude, just leave her alone. -What, are you her boyfriend? -Don't. -Hey, Korea, turn around. -Seriously. Don't. -What the fuck? -So how many days you get? -Five. -Shit! Your mom gonna be pissed or what? -Hey, is it alright if I just stay here? I don't wanna walk all the way home and walk all the way back. -Yeah, yeah of course. So, what are you gonna wear? -Just this, I guess. -You can borrow something, if you want. -Thanks. You want this back? -No, no, you can keep it. I got a bunch of new shirts just like that. -Alright, shots! You want some shots? Come on, come on. Hey, you want one? -Yeah. -Shit. Alright. Who's that? Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink! -Let's go! -Hi. -Hi. -You're home. -Yes, sorry. I was going to call. Come inside. Uh, are you hungry? Have you had dinner? -Yeah, I'm okay. -Okay. I'm having a little bit of vodka. Would you like? -Yeah, sure. Thanks. -Okay. -I spoke with Mi-san, she said you left work early today. -Yes. I needed some air. -Hey, does... does this have anything to do with what I said the other night? Because I mean, listen, if that's not something you're ready for or even want- -No... -That's okay. -No, no, it's not. -I was thinking today about... Do you know about goryeojang? Have you heard? -No. -Um, they're a story from long time ago. When a person became too old, then the son were to carry the person to the top of mountain and leave them there to die. -Wait, did this actually happen? People really did this? -I don't know, I'm not sure. It could be like folk tale. -Okay. -This is very old story from when the country was poor. So, there was not enough food for everyone. And this story is about the son who lies to his very old and very sick mom and tells her they are going to look at the flower in the mountain. She gets excite and climbs onto his back and they go. They walk for a very long time through the mountain. And finally, she realize what her son is doing. She knows where he's taking her. But she doesn't say anything. Instead, she pick off the branch and no... This is not a leaf but pine... -Pine cones? -No, the other, the pine... -Pine... -The little... -Needles? Pine needles? -Yes, yes. Pine needles. Um, she pick the pine needles and drop them on the ground as they go up to the mountain, creating the trails behind them. But the son doesn't think anything about it. He just thinks she's too old and crazy. And finally, they arrives at the top and he puts her on the ground and tells her he will be right back and leave. He walks back down toward his home by himself. But now it's night time so it's too dark for him to see his way back. Then he sees the pine needles on the ground, which takes him back home. And... And he realize... Sorry. He realize what his mother was doing for him that whole time. Even on the way to her death, she never stop worrying for her son. - Shit! -Yo, Jackson! -Hi, Jackson! -Sweet facial, dumbass. Look at your eye. -Shit. -I'm sorry. -Get up bitch! Come on, fight me you little bitch. -Woah, Jackson. -Pussy. -Oh, my gosh! Jackson! - Fight, fight! Fight, fight... -Stop! Stop! Stop! -Stop. -Dude, what the fuck! -Stop! Get away! -Fuck off! -I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Okay, um... Okay. Uh, we should look into some alternative medicines as well. There are lots of other treatments out there besides just chemo nowadays. I can talk to my cousin Katie who's a doctor. Well, I mean, she's a pediatrician but I know she has some friends or colleagues who can help. You can beat this. There's a way to beat this. I know it, I just... I know it. -I feel bad for you. -You feel bad for me? What are you talking about, why would you feel bad for me? -Bad luck. You choose the wrong woman. -I don't think so. Okay, listen. No matter what happens, I'm here. I'm not going anywhere, okay? And sure, you can shut me out or push me away the way you like to but I don't care. I'm gonna stay right here next to you. And I... And I want you to know that I will care for David like he was my own, I promise. I mean it. Really. Always. -You... You are such a nice man. I wish... I wish I deserved you. -God, will you stop saying stuff like that? I mean, jeez... -I'm sorry. -Really, what kind of response is that? -Sorry. -I was just saying, you wish you'd... Come on. -Sorry. -So... -Simon, do you want dance with me? -Do I what? Do I want to dance with you? -Mm-hm. -What are you talking about? -Dance. -Like right now? -Yes. Come. -No. -Come, dance with me. -I don't want to dance. -Please, Simon. -No, I don't even know how to dance. -Please, I'm sick. I'm sick. -That's so not right. Okay. -Please. I want to dance with you. -Fine. Okay, okay. -You should take off your jacket. And you can put your hands here. Let's dance. -What's that sound? This way. Ow! Ow! Ow! -Are you okay? -Mom? -Hm? -Are you sure you're okay? -I'm fine. I think we're almost there. Are you okay? There's some shade over there. Let's go sit there. Let's take a break. Okay? -Should we go back? -Let's just go back. Mom, you have to go to a hospital. Okay, I'll carry you. -No, I'm too heavy. -At this pace it'll be dark by the time we get there. Just get on. Get on! One more.
