EARLY WORKS Directed by Zelimir Zilnik Written by Zelimir Zilnik and Branko Vucicevic Additional Dialogues Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels Good Morning! Good Morning! Have you already masturbated today? Good Morning! As if I don't want things to be better for all of us. We live as hard as our people in the old Yugoslavia. Before the War, our Daddy lived the same as us now. In school, we learn what we should eat in order to be happy at work. We don't eat that! I sleep with my sister in the same bed, but that's not unhygienic because she hardly sleeps at home at all! - Can we come up? - Yes, come up! We have to see what we stand on. If we are good in everything, like we're good in grilling sausages, we would be in power by now! It's clear to me, why daddy beats mom after work, he is completly fed up! Political Theatre Warm Greatings to our comrade nations! Put down your cigarette, fool! From a spark, fire will grow! Need for gathering welth, not naturally modest, that's why those who gather wealth, sacrifice their bodily pleasures to their Golden Fetish. Our international debt is to sing "The International" / recites "The International"/ ..." New World we'll build together, Who was no one before, now will be someone!" Let's stop talking and start action! Villages are neglected but they carry all the wars and hardship on their shoulders. We start our action from the root! People must know where they're heading! DEMOCRACY - YES COLLAPSE - NO I am People, and now you lead me! Proletarians have to make an end to their own Bourgeoisie. Down with the Red Bourgeoisie! We'll get arrested like rats because we gather in groups and our group is not registered. Weak is your sense for the ideas which will change the World! It stinks. It'll be bad for us. Iliya, what we'll eat from? Fuck these plates! We'll all die! Where you've been last night? Feudalism rules in this house! You're seeing me for the last time! Take. 3, 2, 1, now! Task accomplished! Very well... ...we serve to People! I'm not going back home anymore! Shall I read aloud, so you can lose your nervousness? Shame is already a Revolution! If the whole Nation would feel ashamed, then it would be a Lion which retreats before the jump Comedy that Despotism is playing with us, is as dangerous for him as well as the tragedy was for Stewarts and Bourbons and even if we wouldn't consider this Comedy for what it is, it would still be a Revolution. The State is too serious to be treated as a joke, perhaps a Ship full of Fools could sail a long time under the will of the Wind, but it would sail towards meeting its destiny precisely because fools would not believe it this Destiny, which is in front of us, is the Revolution this Destiny, which is in front of us, is the Revolution the only thing that "small sitizens" want, is to live, and to multiply, same as animals want In the chests of these Men, the sense of their own value and Freedom should be awakened again, Philister flower is a Philister world of Animals Despot always sees people stripped of their dignity they blend in front of his eyes, and for him, in the mud of ordinary life, from hich they always re-appear again, like frogs The herd is silent, submissive, and obeys its stomach Have you ever shagged until your teeth went numb? You're too small for that! Admit: how many times you've done it in one night? You're so stupid... ...tell me something nice! With you... ...I could make it 7 times in one night! This is your Art - Line by the Apolon - Finger Let me see, what's this? Oh yes, this should be your Life - line... ...well... you don't even live! and the Venus Hill... it's falling apart you're a type of a quick and frequent guy... First time it went alright, but let's see it again. It will get erected again by the time you say "cheese". "cheese!" Why do you lie? Kiss me, and you'll see! Come on, what are you waiting for? How do you think you'll get to the 7th time? Why are you joking? Tirke and Milja. That's them the flag, with the Star I feel ashamed, for driving in a car. One should go among People on foot! Down with being romaaantic! - Hold it! - I can't! Let me have a look! Hold it! Watch it! To Berliiin! Which one? Here's the lunch. All the real Revolutionars, they get extra bonus when they go on a trip! How much more would they ask for this? Idiotic situation! To-whom-should-we-report? That's why we're not being taken seriously. The bogeyman is circling Europe, the bogeyman of Communism. All the powers of the old Europe have joined together in a holy chase against that bogeyman Communists reject, with disgust, to hide their views and intentions They openly admit, that their purposes can only be achieved by the force and destruction of the entire old social system Let the ruling classes tremble in front of the Communist revolution! In Revolution, Proletarians have nothing to lose... ...except their chains, and they will gain the whole World! Lenin was right, Revolution is made only by paid Revolutionars we're diletants! For us, it's better to do Folk Dances! Kolo, Kolo, all-around, ...embroided, sewed,... ...decorated, aromatized,... quickly brothers, let's gather, so we can all play together, Serbian lives by the fireplace, who can not feel your grace? Montenegrian, little tzar, everybody loves you by far quickly brothers, let's gather, so we can all play together, Are you aware... ...there's no Shiptars here! They're not "Shiptars", you idiot, they're Albanians! It's a fact, these pre-War songs, are no good for brotherhood of our nations Comrades, what's the use of these walls, and all of those hours of hard-work to build them? Zadruga are one of the many deceipts of the politics of Collectivisation. It's a question open for a discussion, are they really appropriate to the psychology of our Village? Stop bull-shitting! Pass me the newspapers. Look, an excellent article by Dz. Husic. If we were smart, we wouldn't come to the village at all! Well, here we are... ...we've put it in our schedule. We won't be able to go further! I know how we'll manage, you're a madman! You're the only man I know that masturbates! You don't have a clue! Everybody does it! Shut up! That's why you all have "dry" spine! You're not a real friend when you let me be cold. Let's not ruin our friendship. We're still friends after all... ...you're not mad at me? Smart ass! We'll be late. Drive! I'd like to ask you, Is it better to use pills, or spiral, against pregnancy? How many times can women and stay healthy? In which year... how old should a woman be, to give birth? When is it best, to give birth? I'd like to ask you one thing: If husband and wife protect themselves, so the woman doesn't get pregnant, does that have any effect on health? There are 2 main methods against unwanted pregnancy: First: not giving oneself to anyone and Second, for those of you who live with your men, is to use different contraceptive methods. This Question was put in Left-Wing Movements since the times of Clara Zetkin, and we're not able to do anything significant to it, until Man, in his Familiy, stops behaving like Despot, like He is the "Owner", and Woman get exploited like Proletarians. Woman, to be liberatred from her submissive role, only a changed structure of the employment and destruction of Monogamous Family can succeed in doing that. But the Third, Technological Revolution, to which we're heading, will surely succeed. Nevertheless, biologically, Women are the stronger Sex and She will rule, in a decade or two - Long live 8th of March, Women's Day! - LONG LIVEEE! To Destroy self-proclaimed and uncomprehensible Art, which is sustained by tortured bodies of workers To stop the emergence and to stop the existence of the new Citizen Class! Culture to be given to the Sickle and Hammer Sickle and Hammer to be above the Culture! Do the Culture Revolution! Comrades from villages, peasants, aware to the resistance we'll face, we feel our duty to inform you that you will be destroyed! And that this Destruction is impossible to stop! all the vital powers are challenging the idiocy of rural life, and you're immersed in it! Although classics say that you're a class that will die-out with the developement of the Production, although your little land is non-profitable, we're, in this transitory period, on the side with workers and poor peasants, WE ARE WITH YOU, BE WITH US! I'm happy that there will be no peasants in Communism! The source of our weakness, is in fear of the Power! Let's summ it up: We hardly managed for 2 days. Let's admit it, our approach was Abstract and Humanist. I don't see it that bad. You, shut up! You've run away, like a whore! And what about you? Have you achieved anything? I don't count on you anymore! Do it more! Have you had enough? Pass me a cigarette! This is the last one. Start the machine. 1... 2... 3... 4... It's burning me! 3 kg of potatoes, for the 5 of us, who can manage that tonight? You're so plain! Do you live on potatoes only? Marko, come in the morning. Kruno, we'll do it here. Dragisha... Listen... you have a go... me, I can't. I can't help you. Ask if you can call Marko. I don't beg anyone... Lepa, come here! Why are you sitting there, you faggots! Lepa! Don't do it with both of them, please! After that with Lepa, I feel sick when seeing you! What? You've been thrown as well? For pig-farm peasants, it's a Revolution when they become clarks! You can't expect him to go further up, since he's happy after leaving his pigsty! Is there Communism in Russia, because everyone can eat "SCHTCHEE" and drink "KVAS"? Let's make boundaries to the sovereignity! Let's be friends! When Communism is been put in place, there is no freedom, for the enemies of the freedom! My Mom will be more liberated by washing-machine, than by right for voting! Fidel Castro shouldn't have come down from the mountain according to you, Lenin should have stayed in Switzerland and Gorkich on the head of the Party according to you, Stalin should still lay where he was laying and Trotsky beside him! according to you, Kameniev, Zinovjev and Bucharin, would not be in the trash of the History according to you, Imre Nadj would still be alive! according to you, Hegel should have been left head-standing! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... Fire! Children, have our Russian brothers arrived? I've had a swim in December, naked, in Moraca river, when it was needed If we go on like this, in Communism, there will be not a single living soul left! RETURN - BACK AMONG THE PEOPLE 1st of May It's better to give all of this to the beggars! The only thing a Proletarian has it's his work-power. He's got no property. Proletarians have nothing to insure. They are going to destroy every possible private security. Until now, we always had where to comeback we have time for excursions to the Village we didn't have to work 8 hours a day, we didn't succeed in helping them, because we were spectators. It's not a matter of helping someone, but to share the destiny of the majority, as we cannot change the position to that majority. Who can calmly suffer everything, deserves all that comes to him. Don't pretend, you're well aware of how many people wait for someone to quit a job, so take it. REVOLUTIONS ARE THE STEAM-ENGINES OF THE HISTORY People wait! Let me tell you! Workers, who are we here working for, so hard? Stop! Let me tell you, people! Just look at what we are looking like! We don't have anything, and yet we are working... for whom? Look. They've been driven in cars, which we can't afford. Why? People! Damn, nobody's listening to us! I'm totally covered in cement! We never talk to each other! And I don't see that much difference, between you and me. We could get aquainted, sometime. You can come as well, but if you're not looking at me! Shame on you, take off that plaster! I've dropped the soap! I've told you not to look! Take my soap. The water is so nice! May I soap you? They suit you so nice! So does yours, but for no use! If Engels didn't say, that honest sexual love exists only among Proletarians, you would get nothing today! After that, you better not come anymore! Oh yes, as if I'm crying hard for you! You are living here as cattle, you stinkers! Sleep! What can I do, when I'm not a Baron! Today, you've finished quickly! Hey Sweetie, come to Mickey, there's something for you to see! Come here to see, there is a spare room! You can sleep in "7B", the girls are there. It's not the point to survive, but to live sincerely and with purpose. We can fix the windows, and settle down here. What's wrong with the female dormitory? Her gorgeous lips, in beautiful reds, her rounded breasts, of perfect shapes, you're so dear to me, you're like an angel for me, For Mila, I live, For her, I'll die, For Mila, I live, For her, I'll die, For those who want, fruits will grow, For those who don't want, they'll die. Everything else will come to its place, being healthy is the most important. It's only important that you're healthy and honest. Money will come somehow. Come! "Gone with the Wind", guys! You haven't been afraid until now. I'm not afraid now! What did you want? To see if you can do it with all three of us at the same time! I've told you already: It was the end of it! I don't give a damn about you! Let's see, who's gonna be the first? You've always played silly games, you idiots! You never succeeded in completing a single thing! "Those who do the Revolution only half-way, they're digging their own grave" - Saint Just THE END
