The only men who get caught are those who don't love their wives enough. How'd it go? Full of details, eh, Cinders? "Dear Donald... if you are reading this letter, it means I now need you to help me.

Demi? Demi? If this is one of your games... Demi... I'm Donald, his driver. Why are you here? Where's Demi? Mr. Lampross... is dead. He died suddenly. Mr. Lampross gave me certain instructions. He wants the flat cleared out. So I'm going to have to ask you to leave. Now. I'm sorry, it's Mr. Lampross's instructions. Oh, uh, what's... what's in the bag? It's rubbish. Oh. Well, if it's rubbish, I'll take it. Uh, can... can you put that back, please? - It's mine. It was a gift. - No, put it back, please. - I said put it back. - He gave it to me years ago. Put it back. Can you give me my keys, please? Asshole. You want a lift? Was it his heart? Why won't you tell me what happened? You think I don't care. I know about Donald. Donald knows nothing about me. What does that tell you? Safer for both of us. Boo! You've got no idea what I risked for Demi. You did say Royd's Lane, didn't you? Who the fuck do you think you are? Stop the car. I said stop the fucking car. It's not what it looks like. What do you think it looks like, sir? I was just giving her a lift. Could you please tell me the name of the young lady you're giving a lift to, sir? Turn your engine off. Step out the car, sir. - Thank you, base, I will inform the suspects. - Copy that. This car isn't registered at the address you gave, sir. Yeah, well, that's 'cause I, uh... I-I've just got separated from it. Would you please come with me to the car, sir? If you think I'm one of them, you've got it all wrong. It doesn't matter what I think, madam. I'm just doing my job. I'm actually a lawyer. Hey, what the fuck? I'm gonna fuck you up, bitch. I'm sorry about this. It shouldn't you take longer than about ten minutes. Thanks. This is Demi. Please leave a message. Oi! What was KD doing at your house? Oi! Bitch. Oi! I asked you a fucking question, bitch. What was KD doing at yours? He wouldn't go to my house. He went with Mum. Tracey took 'em. Your mum wouldn't go anywhere with her. I'm part of the family now. She's even chosen a new name for me when I convert. Are you going to convert before or after that bastard's born? Fuck you. Fucking bitch, who's a fucking bastard now then, eh? - Oi! Oi! - Hey, bitch! Are you all right? Smile, bitch! Yeah! But if they're deleted, then you don't have a problem, do you? I said he normally deleted them. But this one was special to him. We took it a couple of weeks ago in Paris. Look, I'm worried that he didn't get a chance to delete it. We have to be sure. We? I thought that you came to the flat to clear all signs of me. I was given a job to do. As far as I'm concerned, once it was done, that was it, job over. But if there's a video of me on that phone, you haven't done your job, have you? What would Demi think if he knew that you let his wife see it? Imagine the pain that you'd be putting her through, Donald, the man he could trust with anything. Amber! - Has that bitch Banu been... - Stop! She's my sister. Amber! Amber! I got a brother! I got a brother! Who put that in his head? I got a broth... What did you do that for? Take your sister's bags up. Before you start shouting, ask your abu why they came. What happened? KD. Please tell me that you didn't let him in our house. Ammi, I'm talking to you. They came for their share. - They could have phoned. - They did. The day after your grandfather's funeral, but you know your father, one excuse after another. But I don't understand. Why is he making excuses? Why doesn't he just give it to them? He sold it. One of them days? You missed our Heather. She wants you to sign these. What have I missed? Fuck's sake, Donald, is that all you've got to say? Your boss just got buried, your wife served you divorce papers... They didn't bury him. Took him to Greece. Well, wherever the fuck they took him. Listen, mate, I'm not just saying this 'cause she's me sister, but sooner or later, you've gotta start facing up to things. You can't keep your head buried in the sand. Can I borrow your toolbox? Get the fuck out of there, you horny bastard! No more envelopes after today. It's finished. No more overtime. No more working late. No more weekends. Ammi, why haven't you paid this? Bring my handbag down. Here. Bye. Karen, have you got a copy of that transcript - from yesterday? - Oh, yes, I've got it here. - Hello? - Hello, Donald? I thought you said you were gonna call. Yeah, but I... Have you found it yet? I can't really speak at the moment. I'll get back to you, okay? How's it going with Heather then? It's not really. I know, love, it's hard. Sometimes you only stay together for the sake of the kids. I mean, look at me and Mark. Real shit. Get that down you before it gets cold. I will. Thanks, Ruth. Shh. It's Mum. Hello. No, don't worry. I'll find him, Mummy. Okay. Okay. Is everything all right? I'm going to need your help. My little brother's run away. How old is he? He's 19. But he's got learning difficulties. Look, I can't go in there dressed like this. Can you just pop your head around the corner and see if he's there? I'm not popping me bloody head in there. It's only a bar. It's hardly the Dog and Duck, is it? He's just a kid. Look. Okay. I'll just be a second. Let me see that picture. Who are you, bro? Fuck off. Right, fat boy, off limits. Y'all know my man Pudding! And y'all know KD! Are you ready, boys? One, two, three... bong's away! Is he there? Mm-hmm. Kiss him and I'll cut your fucking tongue out. Only for you, bro. Why does he keep looking at me? Don't worry about him. I know him. You want me to take you back to Bradford? - Where's Pinoo? - Whoa. Not in front of the pig. You know swine's haram. Yo, Babylon! I seen ya. Fuckin' Babylon. Call Pinoo. Can you call my brother, please? You asking me a favor? Gingey? Pinoo. Get him. Pinoo, bro. Go home. Your mother. Okay, after you finish, bro, okay? Yeah. Love you too, bro. Pinoo know how to show respect. Do you want me to say thanks? No. Just kiss my little mouse. He miss you. Leave him! Leave him! Fucking shit! Get... stop it! You all right, mate? Where the fuck are you going? You can't leave him like this. Right, you park yourself up there. Point your fucking eyes in that direction. You see any lights, shout and run like fuck. You know what he's like. Hey, imagine the headline. "Sperm stealers." Oh, for fuck's sake. Cinders. Cinders! Hello. Cinders! Now then, all right? I... I... I need to speak to Donald. Does he... You want to talk to him? What for? Cinders, Cinders, fucking hell, get here. One word from me, love, and she just does whatever she wants. You, uh... sure you thinking of the right Donald? Dopey twat with glasses? So you don't work with Heather. You don't work with him You're obviously not related. You're not a mate of Amy's, are you? I, um... came to apologize. We were cousins. Oh. He was my cousin. We grew up together... in the same house. On my 16th birthday, our parents took us to Pakistan. The second we landed... they told us we were getting married. I didn't want to marry KD. He didn't want to marry me. But we knew... we just knew there was no way that we were getting back to England unless we did. So as best friends, we made a deal. We pretended to get married. How... how do you pretend to get married? Haven't you ever said something you didn't mean? We said yes... just so we could get back home to Bradford. But he changed his mind. As far as the world was concerned, I was his wife. And he could do whatever he wanted. So I had two choices. Kill myself... or lie to get a divorce. So what did you do? I killed myself, Donald. No, I mean seriously. Run! The bastard's onto us! Run! - Billy! - What? I know it's you! Get the fuck off my land! Sorry about that. I'm getting a bit too old for this sperm-stealing lark. Demi and I went back a long way. To be absolutely frank, when he first raised the issue, I considered it a favor rather than a recommendation, and your move to London was a fait accompli. However... now that circumstances have changed, I was hoping you'd reconsider. We don't want to lose you, Amber. Really? Thank you. I'm flattered. Um, but as you know, I still have one more exam to sit. Oh, a mere formality from what I hear. Hearsay. If it's not proven, it's not true. One of the first things that you taught me, Mr. Quest. Why doesn't Abu just give him his share of the land? It's not like we're ever going back. He would rather die. It would be better to die than apologize to that bastard. How can you make me go there after everything? When are you going to stop judging us by British standards? You should thank Allah you were 16 and not 12. Go, put this on. We're friends! We're friends again! Come on, Amber. Don't you think it's time we let bygones be bygones? Oi, Faz. No one would guess you are a hafiz, bro. How come you don't wear a beard? It's a shame we spend so much time trying to look like our honorable Prophet... sallallahu alayhi wa sallam... instead of acting like him. Well said. It was worth coming all the way... I hate him, Donald. I hate him. I think you've got to forget all about this. - You're going to London... - It's not just about me. The thought of him being anywhere near my family. It makes my flesh crawl. Do you honestly think that it's gonna make a blind bit of difference if you stay in Bradford? Honestly, do you? I've got something for you. Now, this might cheer you up a little bit. There's a little bit here, and I wasn't able to, um... couldn't quite get that bit. Thank you, Donald. Will you keep it safe for me until I've actually passed my exams? So what happened to, "Donald, I've passed, I've passed"? I know, I... I made a promise to someone. Oh, aye, okay, well... I'll keep it for you. Thank you. - Billy! - Oh. Sorry. I was desperate. Bleach. Bottom-left cupboard. Marry me, Amber. What, with your filthy habit? I could change for the right woman. Coffee? At this time? I'd never sleep. - It's only 5:00. - Already? She's been a right bitch since she got pregnant. Leave her alone. See? Told you. It's like she doesn't know us. Nearly had me bloody fingers off yesterday. I don't blame you for biting someone... who pisses in the sink. He's disgusting, isn't he? Yeah, not very nice, shh. Billy! Billy! Where the fuck are you?! Billy? What you doing with that? Put it fucking down! - Why? - Put it down! - It's not yours! - It's not yours either. - It's my Amy's. - It's our Amy's. Give it back to me. Give it here. I built it. Hey, Donald, Donald, Donald, mate. Let's celebrate the way she would've wanted us to, eh? Yeah. It's midnight, mate. Happy birthday, Amy. Happy birthday. Let your abu deal with it. Say makeup is vanity. Vanity is a sin! Let me deal with it, please. You never deal with anything, Zulfikar. This is where it starts. And look where it ends. I'm going to write a ta'wiz. Tell her I don't want any ta'wiz in the house. Open your eyes, Zulfikar. The spirit of the devil lies under your roof. You're lucky I'm here. Tomorrow may have been too late. Ammi! Ammi, she's gonna kill me! - Do something! - Enough! Get out and take your sister with you! - Get out. Get out. - Come on, come on. Looks like you've forgotten where we come from, Shaeen. Am I gonna go to hell? No. Come with me. Why does aunty call you the devil? Because I like playing with fire. It's our little secret, okay? Come on. Don't worry. She's only having puppies, you know. - She'll be all right. - Here. Hey, you okay? You all right? Hmm? - What, is it stinging? - Mm-hmm. Okay, I got something for that. Oh, no, no, it's all right, this'll... Does that feel any better? Hmm? You won't tell Amber, will you, Uncle Donald? - Of course not. - She won't let me come back. You want to see these, Donald! Well, I'm not going through that again. You? 500, 1,000, one and a half, two, two and a half... three, oh. Here's your cut, Donald. Rar! I'm gonna give it to you, Miriam. Happy birthday. I'm gonna call you Lucy. I am. But what about Mum? Don't worry about Mum. I'll work on her for you. In the meantime, Uncle Donald can look after Lucy. - Can't you, Uncle Donald? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, sure, yeah, yeah, 'course. It was beautiful.

Hi, Donald. I've done it. I'm free. Donald! Oh, we found a particularly interesting video on Father's phone. See, by the time we got back from the funeral, everything on this just mysteriously disappeared. But the IT department waved their magic wand, and, lo and behold, we found it. Think you might enjoy this, Donald. Look, look. It was beautiful. Thank you. Just pull off here, please. 817. The number of properties in our UK portfolio. Two, the number of properties in my father's personal name. And I live in one of them. Tell me about this place, Donald. Well, is it familiar? Father was absolutely right to trust you, Donald, but you have to realize he's gone now. There's no one left to measure your loyalty but me.

Well, it's the truth, isn't it? Demi Lampross the great philanthropist. Why didn't he give you the money just like he did everybody else? What for? It was my parents that owed money, not him. Look, he was a businessman, and... I was no charity. Demi and I made a deal. Receptionist to lawyer. And then we'd call it quits. In fact... today was the day he would have given me that owl, said goodbye... forever. You know I have no say. What kind of a mother are you? What's your problem? You jealous? Ammi, please. We don't need to do this. I'll stay. I won't go to London. I'll stay here. They said they can give me my job back. It's too late, beta. Your father has given them his word. Which one? What's wrong? Come here. KD. It's okay. She VIP. We tell Miriam when she go. Sit. Sit down. Coffee? Tea? First time you're here. Gotta have something. Tell her what we're not allowed to eat. I know, but...

You think changing your name make you Muslim. I... I wouldn't do anything to hurt you. I love you. I never gonna trust you, girl. Haven't I been punished enough? Let's talk about punishment. Wherever my mother go, people still laugh at her. You know why they laugh? 'Cause you lied. Have you forgotten what you did? We made a deal, a stupid deal. I was 16. - So was I. - I made a mistake. Okay, KD. I accept that you made a mistake. But you're a man now. And I am begging you, please let Miriam go. I'll tell everyone that I lied if that's what you want. Shalwar kameez really suits you. Always did. Want to run away with me, Amber? You just don't get it, do you? You were like a brother to me, my big brother. And you raped your sister. With the blessing of your father and mother, a thousand people will witness the auspicious occasion of my marriage to Miriam. My fiancée and I would like you to attend. Stop the bullshit, KD. You know that what you're doing is wrong. I know you're going to hell. And you're not? I didn't put my hand on the Koran and lie. You know the difference between you and me? I know that I'm going to hell. You still think you're gonna deal your way out of it. This wedding is not gonna happen. Your father will regret sending these out. Come on, hurry up. What the fuck does "technically correct" mean? It's a forced marriage. It's not right. There must be a loophole or something. It's the holy Koran you're talking about, Amber. It's not one of your legal textbooks. If you knew Islam better, you'd know that only kafirs look for loopholes. Did you just call me a kafir? - What does that mean to you? - A non-Muslim. No, a concealer of truth. All I can say is have the courage to confront them with the truth. They don't care about the truth, Faz. All they care about is their egos. That's not what I meant. If Miriam doesn't want to marry KD, all she has to do is say no at the nikah. Couldn't be written any clearer. Be real, Faz. Do you really expect Miriam to say no in front of all them people? Allah only helps those who have the courage to stand up and tell the truth. No. No. Okay, just try again, okay? You've got... no. No. Hello. My name's Nathan Lampross. My father passed away recently.

Tell me, shoot me, or my man Ginger gonna take her for a walk. Ten seconds. Where's Amber? Nine. Eight. Seven. Where's Amber? Six. Khalid? Miriam's in Manchester. Please stand well away from the edge of platform six. The train is not stopping at this station. If I didn't sympathize with your situation, you'd be coming with me. Excuse me, did you speak to her when she was alone? She told me she's perfectly happy. Good day! How dare you bring police to my dar?! Go inside, beta. Go. Hi. I'm sorry for shouting at you. I promise I won't do it again. Miriam... please don't be scared. Donald's outside. He's with the police. And he's with little Lucy. She misses you. - What's that? - It's nothing. Miriam, let me see it. What is it? - Everyone says you're evil! - Miriam... And they all say you're a prostitute! - You're a bitch! I hate you! - Miriam... You have to come with me. Get the fuck out! Get out! Get out, come on! Get out! It's all right, it's all right, beta. It's all right. Can't you get a High Court injunction or something? Against what? A perfectly legal marriage? She hates me. She thinks I'm evil. Well, I mean, she's had the fear of God put in her, hasn't she? It's over, Donald. So you're gonna do nothing? No, I'm gonna do exactly as I'd planned. I'm going to go to London and live happily ever after. Cheers. What? It's your face. It reminds me of the first time I met you. I don't know who was more frightened. Well, I wasn't the one shaking. What would you have done if you caught someone peeping on you? I wasn't peeping. You were. - No, I wasn't. - Oh, come on. - I wasn't. - You must've had a look. No, I didn't. Not even one teeny-weeny glance? Have you booked your ticket? I've been told when someone changes the subject, it's usually 'cause they're hiding something. Is there a dark, seedy side to you, Donald, - something I should know about? - Like what? Oh, relax. Why you being so defensive? I'm not being defensive. It's okay, Donald. You don't have to lie to me. I don't lie. You should know that by now. Objection sustained. Demi used to swear by you. But you are a man just like he was. Well, we're not all like Demi. What are you looking at? Why did your wife think that you were curb crawling? You know why. No. Not really. I mean, I've only known you a couple of months. But I'd never suspect you of paying for sex. And that's what bothers me. After all those years of marriage... she did. Why did you keep me a secret, Donald? Be honest. Why don't you just tell her? Tell her what? - The truth. - The truth? The truth is I met a half-naked girl in me dead boss's flat. Oh, and I'm sorry about this, Heather, but the psychopathic ex-husband is also a drug dealer, and he's about to marry a 15-year-old... - 16. - 16 fucking years old! - She's 16! - What are you gonna do now? You're gonna run, are you? 'Cause that's what you've always done. You ran from the apartment. You ran from Bradford. You ran from the police, and now you're running from your sister. - I'm not. - You're acting like she's fucking dead! I don't know what to do, Donald. Just... tell me what to do. Speak to your dad. He won't listen. You don't understand what it's like. I mean, he's your father, isn't he? I... I'm... I'm a father meself. I know what that means. How can he not love Miriam? I don't know. How can you not love you, Amber? I'm sorry. - You can't marry... - How dare you?! You're gonna have to listen. Listen to what? More lies? Your lies have brought us to this. Mine? You're the one that took a 16-year-old girl to Pakistan and forced her to become a woman, and now you're doing the same thing to Miriam. She has to marry some man! Why not Khalid? He's got good business. Is that it? Money? How much would it cost to get her back? I don't need your money. Why didn't you say that when you went to Haj? I said I would pay it back to you. You could never pay me back for what I've done. Never. You shouldn't have been a father. You should have been a pimp. Bye, Cind. Look after her for me. It'll cost you. Any excuse. Where are you taking me? You do know I've got a train to catch, don't you? You might not want to see it, but I do. I wish I could just talk to her. If you could, what would you say to her? I couldn't get anywhere near her. Look at all them people. No, but I mean, if you could, would you talk to her? Yes or no, if I could get you in there, would you talk to her? - Yes. Yeah. - Yes? Keep your phone on. Everything's gonna be okay. I'm here. What's she doing here? Jee. Qubool hai. Qubool hai? Qubool hai. Qubool hai? She said yes! Wait! What's wrong? I didn't hear the third yes. Do you doubt Banu's word? Did you hear the third yes? No. Why are you argue about this? Let's ask Miriam. I'll ask her myself. Miriam beta, don't be like your father, please. Don't be afraid of all these people. Be honest only to him alone. Nobody else matters here. Did you say the third yes? No. You did the right thing. Thank you. She said no. Leave, Khalid! I had to say no. Couldn't leave you, girl. Love you's too much. Fuck off, yeah? Okay, bro. - Not him. - It's okay. After today, everything will be like it was before. I told her only once. Once can last a long, long time. So what am I gonna do if Miriam calls and wants to see Lucy? Just tell her to wait until I get back. Oh, come on, Donald, it's only a hug. Get an ambulance! Get an ambulance, a doctor! Quick, quick, move! Amber, listen to me. Amber, can you hear me? Amber, can you hear me? Hang on. Hang on, there's an ambulance coming. Oh, Christ. The fuck are you looking at?! Move! Get the fucking ambulance! Quack, quack. It was God's will. And bad things happen to bad people. Oh. She must've been really bad then. Is this Lucy? My fiancée miss her. We're getting married next month. I'll send you an invite. No, I'll bring it to your house personally. Look after her for me. Fuck off. Fuck off! It was God's will. Bad things happen to bad people. Subtitles by explosiveskull
