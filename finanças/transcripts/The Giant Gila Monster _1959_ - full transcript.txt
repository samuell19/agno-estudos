(dramatic music) - [Narrator] In the enormity of the West, there are still vast and virtually unexplored regions bleak and desolate, where no human ever goes, and no life is ever seen. It is as though the land had been posted by God. It is in these lonely areas of impenetrable forest and dark shadows that the Gila monster still lives. How large the dreaded Gila monster grows no man can say. (bright dance music playing) (leaves rustling) (gasps softly) (teens screaming) (metal clanking) (monster screeches) (eerie music) (lively dance music) (man chuckling) (engine rumbles) - Say, here come Gordy and Jennie. - Hey, gang! - Hey, where've you been? - Hi! - You better cool that foot jazz. - How's that? - What about that? - Well, Spook will be charging you with an entertainment plan. - He charges us for everything else. - Hi, Spook. - Hi, kids. - [Teen In Blue] Hey, how are the new parts on the bomb? (lively music playing) (birds chirping) (teens chatting) - Gordon. Jennie. Where's Pat and Liz? I thought we'd be the last ones here. - Yeah, they're probably out spooking around somewhere. - Maybe they broke down. - Not in his heap. I worked on myself. - That makes it too cool. - That wouldn't make any difference if they goofed a speed shift or something. - Yeah, and that squirrel is just the one that could do it. (voices overlapping) - Oh, wonderful. - What kept you so long, Lisa? - Oh, Mr. Wheeler smoked two cigars at the table after dinner, and I could not get at the dishes until he was through. - What time did Pat leave? - Pat did not come home for dinner. That's why his father was so upset. - Who's that? (engine rumbling) - There's Old Man Harris. - Man, that fellow has a jewel of a car. - Well, look then. (man humming) - Hey. - Hi, Mr. Harris. - Hi, Mr. Harris. - Hi, how you doing? - Hey, you wanna sell that Deuce? - Why you fellers always asking me to buy my car? - That 32 is the ideal stock to convert to a bomb. - Buying a car, son, is just like getting married or going to New York City. Everybody ought to do it once, but nobody ought to do it twice. (all chuckling) - Hey, I can get you a good price on that. - Paid $695 for that car 26 years ago. Ten years ago it wasn't worth a dime. Last month I turned down $100 for it. When it gets back up to $695 again, I'll sell it. (all chuckling) (teens chattering) Hey, Spook. Gimme a snort of that there sode pop. (all chuckling) - Hey, gang, you know this will be Lisa's first trip to a drive-in? - Oh, we have drive-ins in France, too. - Yeah? - Yes. I went twice with my brother on his motor scooter. (all chuckling) - Oh, her brother on a motor scooter. - On a motor scoter! Now that's my idea of absolutely nothing to do. Yeah, okay, come on let's go. - [Teen In Yellow Shirt] Don't be too late. - We're gonna pull on out. - Hey Chase, if the roads clear, I'll drag you to Bartonelle's Corner. - I can't, I'm driving barefoot. - [Gordy] You still running on that old rubber? - Yeah. Hey Spook, when Pat and Liz get here, will you tell them that we went to the drive-in and for them to catch up? (engine rumbling) Thank you. - We sure will. - And I'll give you $150. - You're talking like my foot's asleep. Who does he think he's playing with, kids? (both chuckling) (lively music playing) (birds chirping) - Sheriff. - What's the trouble, Mr. Wheeler? - Pat didn't come home last night. - He didn't? - No, evidently, he was out with Liz Humphries. She didn't come home either. - Oh? - I want you to find out why, and don't leave a stone unturned in doing so. Do I make myself clear? - I understood, Mr. Wheeler. There weren't any wrecks reported last night. Your son Pat he's about 19, isn't he? - That's right. - Just a year older than I was when I got married. - You think they eloped? He wouldn't dare. - I didn't say that. But if they were out together all night, you better hope they have. - This is a missing person's report, and I wanna know what you're gonna do about it. - Well, I'll send in an APB on both of them and the car. I don't think it'll do much good if they went out to get married. They'd already be across the state line. - Why, if he'd gotten married, I'll wring his neck. If you ask me it's that Chase Winstead. He's older than the others. Sets them all wrong. Why, he's got more influence on Pat than I have. - Chase Winstead does more about keeping them in line than getting them in trouble than I know. He supported his mother and sister ever since his dad died on one of your drill rigs. Your son could take a page out of his book, Mr. Wheeler. - When I get through with my son, he won't have a book left. Now you locate him or I'll have your job. - If you wanna be the only peace officer in 10,000 square miles and 1,000 miles of road, you're welcome to it. I'll do everything I can to locate both of them, Mr. Wheeler. (door thuds) (birds chirping) - Hi, Sheriff. - [Sheriff] Hi, Chase. - Got a new set of wheels. - Yeah, new to me. With that clunker I had, I'd be chasing you boys on a bicycle in a couple of days. - Oh, come on, Sheriff. Outside of Pat Wheeler, we haven't had a ticket in our gang in eight months. - Oh, I was just kidding. - What's the mileage on it? - Oh, about 35,000. County bought it from the state. Those lucky stiffs on highway get a new car every year. - Let me have it for a couple of days, and I'll tune it up for you. - Oh, you'd choke it off, so I could never catch you! - You couldn't get that deuce of mine right now! Now let me have that patrol car. I'll turn it into a slingshot that'll catch anything. - We'll make a deal. Chase? Just between us Liz Humphries and Pat Wheeler didn't get home last night. - Oh? They were supposed to meet us at the drive-in, but they didn't show up. We wondered what happened. - Were they in any kind of trouble? - What do you mean? - You know. - Oh. No, I don't think so. - Chase, level with me. - I'm almost positive they weren't in any trouble. I'd know. - Do you think they might have run off to get married? - Well, they've been going steady for over a year now, and I know they talked about it, but... No, not like for right now. - Did Pat have any money stashed? - (sighs) Yeah, some. - Like how much? - Well, he was talking about getting a new blower and a mill. That's about 500 bucks. - Where did he get that kind of money? - He saved it. His old man gives him a good allowance when he's not mad at him. - What bank does he use? - None. He's afraid his did would find out. - He could have been saving it to get married, couldn't he? - It's his money. I guess he could do whatever he wants with it. But, you know, if he eloped, his old man would put him down flat. - I know. But Pat's smart enough to provide for himself till the old man cooled off. - Pat's the only one of the gang I couldn't slow down. Did you check the hospitals? - Yeah. Where could I find the rest of the gang? - Well, I don't know about Bob and Gordy, but Chuck and Rick went over to Easton. They wanted to check with the Wheel Cats about next Saturday night's platter party. - Next Saturday night? - Yeah. - You warn the gang I'll be cruising that pass that night. No dragging. - Okay, I'll tell them. - You get any postcards from those two, let me know. (engine rumbling) - Hi, Sheriff. - Hi, Kelly. Howdy, Ebb. - Hello, Sheriff. - I don't have any word for you, Mrs. Humphries. - She's a good girl, Sheriff. I ain't worried. - How come you drove around the truck all night then? - You don't think she might have eloped, do you? - Could be, she's pretty close mouthed about her affairs. - More thank likes of Wheeler. Ain't marrying our kind of folks. - You don't have a phone, so I just dropped around to let you know I'm doing everything I can. - We know that, Sheriff, and we sure do appreciate it. - Sorry Liz put you to so much trouble. - It's never any trouble looking after kids. - Let me know if I can help, Sheriff. - Thanks, Ebb. - Thank you, Sheriff. - Goodbye. - [Ebb] Yes, we gotta quit worrying this way. We gotta trust in the Lord. We gotta pray. (engine rumbling) - Harris. - Morning, Sheriff. - Let me smell your breath. (birds chirping) Okay, go ahead. - Okay. (engine cranks) (crickets chirping) - Hi, Chase. - Hi. - Did you get that diesel tracker fixed? - Yeah, she's all set. - Good. My boy, that's one trip I'm glad I don't have to make very often. - The stuff heavy I'll help you unload. - No, not heavy. It's hot. Wheeler's sinking another oil well, and he's afraid of fire when it comes in. There's four quarts of nitroglycerin out there in that cab. (Chase whistles in surprise) He wants us to keep it out back in the storehouse. - You know, last winter when number 21 came in, I made a $100 for that stuff. Dad showed me how to use it. It's not so bad, as long as it doesn't get nervous. - Well, I'm sorry I was late getting back. But with that cargo, I was afraid to do over five miles an hour. - Oh, it's not so dangerous as long as it's in a nitro case. - But I took these out of the case! - Holy smoke. You're lucky to be standing here talking about it! I'll put it in the shed! (crickets chirping) - Much action this afternoon? - Sheriff got a new patrol car. We'll get a tune-up job out of that. - Is that nitro safe out there? (Chase scoffs) - Well, if it decides to blow, it's not safe anywhere. (telephone rings) I'll get it. - That's not our ring. - No, it's the sheriff's. If there's been a wreck, I get a tow job out of it. I also have a deal with the ambulance if someone's hurt. (Compton chuckles) - You work all the angles, don't you, Chase? - Mr. Compton, I have to. - [Man] Hello, Sheriff? - [Sheriff] Yes. - [Man] I'm 12 miles out beyond the red schoolhouse a car has run into the ditch. - [Sheriff] Oh? - [Man] Yeah, it's a pretty bad wreck. - [Sheriff] What kind of a car? - [Man] Well, it's a sedan. Pontiac, I believe. Someone could've been hurt pretty bad. Maybe you should get out there pretty quick. - [Sheriff] Did you stop and investigate? - There's been a wreck 12 miles out of town. Where's the wrecker? - Home. I used the A-frame to build a doggone rock garden. Look, you take your car and keep the city wreckers off. I'll get our wrecker and follow you. (siren blaring) (crickets chirping) - I wondered who was on that party line a while ago. - Well, it cost me to get on that line with you. I figured since it was on your call station anyway, you wouldn't care. - Yeah. This is a pretty good one. - [Chase] Yeah. - [Sheriff] This engine's still warm. - Say, did you see the skid marks out here? They go at a direct right angle to the direction of travel. (eerie music) - Yeah. No digs in the macadam either. Somebody was hurt in here. There's blood all over the upholstery. Let's take a look around. - I've already looked around. There's nobody here. - Real good? - Yeah, real good. Well, maybe somebody came by and picked them up. It could've been the people who called in. - Nah, they'd have said something. - Then why didn't they wait? - People will go to the trouble to report an accident, but they won't stay around. Don't want to fill out the reports. - So what do you do now? - Well, I'll take the license number and engine number. Call headquarters. Maybe they've got a line on them. Chase, how are your headlights? - Fine, just fine. - Both of them burning? (gentle music) How many times have I warned you about getting that headlamp fixed? - Twice. But the first time it was just a suggestion. - Seal beam only costs $4. - Well, I had some unexpected expenses. - Oh? Missy? - Yeah, the doctor said she'd be able to start walking again pretty soon, and it took all the money I had to make a part down payment on her braces. - You know, I think this is a complete washout. You've probably got a screwdriver. I don't think the insurance company would miss one of those headlamps. (engine rumbling) (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) (lizard hissing) (lizard hissing) (lizard hissing) (man screaming) (crickets chirping) Well, I got the whole story. Car was stolen out of state, and the plates were stolen in state. So whoever stole it had beat it, hurt or not, as long as they could navigate. - Well, is there anything else I can do here, Sheriff? If not, I'll get this on back to the garage. - No, go ahead. Chase, will you give me a hand? I wanna take some pictures of those skid marks. You stand by them for scale. - Sure, glad to, Sheriff. - Good. (truck engine rumbling) (engine revving) (crickets chirping) (eerie music) Trouble, Chase? - I don't know, Sheriff. Take a look. It was just sitting here. - Probably fell off of a car. - No scratches on it. - Yeah, maybe it landed in a bush. - No, as thin as that imitation leather is, even a bush should take some of it off. - Was it just like that when you found it? - Yeah, straight up. - Probably belonged to some hitchhiker, or it might have belonged to the fella that stole that car and wrecked it. Say, look at this. (mysterious music) A half pack of cigarettes and one unlit. (dramatic music) That suitcase don't belong to any car thief. He was around here too long. I'll take it in. - I'll put it in the car for you. - Somebody will be around to claim it. See you later, son. - Right, Sheriff. (lizard hissing) (engine cranks) (engine rumbles) (engine cranks) (engine rumbles) (Chase whistles) (gentle music) Hey. What's with the code bit? I got your phone call. - When I was serving dinner to Mr. Wheeler, he became very angry. He said if I saw you again, he would have me sent back to France. - He can't do that. - Oh, yes, he can. He's my sponsor. He put up the bond. - That has to guarantee that you wouldn't become a ward of the state. Now, we don't have to worry about that. You know how to speak English well enough to get a job anywhere. - He said it's immoral for me to go out with you. What's immoral about it? - Nothing. - I don't want to go away, Chase. - You won't have to, honey. - They think it's your fault that Pat ran away. - Well, he can think whatever he wants to think. He shouldn't take it out on you, but we hadn't better take any chances. You go back inside, and, look, don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay. (engine revving) (tires screeching) (tires screeching) - [Chase] You all right? - All right? Dad, I'm superb. Seven to a box, no corners. I'm around Hal! - Sorry I asked, Mister, uh? - Smith. Horatio Alger Smith. - Sorry I asked that, too. How'd you get in the ditch? You fall asleep? - Ah, no, no. There was this big pink and black thing drove right in front of me. It had stripes this wide. - Sure, sure. Look, you come up and sit in my truck, and I'll get your car. - Okay, that sounds like a good deal. Who knows, maybe we can... (chain clanking) (engine cranks) - Hey, man, you can't drive this car! Fender's cutting the wheel! - Sure I can the motor works, see? But, thanks for everything, Dad. You're a cotton-picking prince. (engine revving) - Okay, just a second. I'll get out of the way. (horn honking) What is it? - Move over, Dad, I wanna pass! (horn honking) - What is it now? - I think you'd better give me a tow, Dad. The steering wheel won't work. - [Chase] (laughs) Okay, you take a nap.

How'd I get here, anyway? - I towed you in this morning, remember? - As a matter of fact, I remember very, very little. - You said somebody ran you into the ditch, but I didn't see any other cars. - How'd you ever get me in that bed, anyway? - I carried you in there, and I sat on you till you fell asleep. - That must've been quite a chore. - You wouldn't have gotten very far in your condition. - Look, I really appreciate it, um? - Chase Winstead. - Chase. My golly, how much I owe you? - Well, I bent the fender out from the wheel. You want me to fill it in and touch it up for you? - No, I don't think so. I'll get that done when I get back to the city. - Here have some coffee. - Oh, great. - How about two bucks? - Man, this coffee's worth two bucks all by itself. How about the tow? - No, I was coming this way anyway. I missed out on a little study time. Make it three bucks? - Dad, you go to school? - Sort of, I take a correspondence course in engineering. - Well, look, I really feel indebted to you, and I'd like to do something to pay you back. No next time you're into town, there's my card. Look me up, will you? - All right, will do. - Okay. And by the way, buy yourself a sponge rubber hammer, man. - All right, I will. - I'll see you, Chase. - Thank you. Steamroller Smith? The disk jockey. (engine cranks) Mr. Smith! Two 20s! How about that. (birds chirping) Sheriff? - Howdy, son. Have you heard anything from Pat and Liz? - No, nothing. - Chase, I'm in a jam, and I need your help. Wheeler swings a big enough stick in this country to make it rough, and he's doing it. Oh, I can understand his concern about Pat, but I just don't have a big enough force to comb this area inch-by-inch. - Is he demanding that? There was a man killed in a wreck in a small canyon in a big city last year, and it took them 19 days to find him. I don't know what they expect of me. - Yeah, I remember that. Look Sheriff, maybe I can get tomorrow off, and I'll get the gang, and we can go out and search that pass. At least you can put that in your report. - I was hoping you'd say that. I can start at the upper end and work towards you. Can I have your help in another matter? - Sure. What? - You remember how those skid marks just went at right angles to the direction the car was traveling? - That's right, they did. - Headquarters think I'm nuts. - Well then, they're nuts. Didn't you send them that picture? - Well, I'm not the world's greatest photographer. Pictures didn't come out. Can't see the skid marks on the black top. - Well, that's what happened. I even wiped up the rubber dust with my fingers. - You might have to sign a statement to that effect for me. - You've got it. Look, you can even see the bald spots on the tires where they went sideways... - Yeah, that's the spot all right. But there's another thing that puzzles me. - Yeah, what? - How those tires got off of that car and almost on yours. - Well, look on this wreck, they'd rot, and my rod they could prevent a blowout. Maybe even an accident. - Well, take good care of them in case the owner shows up. - Right. - See you tomorrow. - Right. (birds chirping) (engines revving) (engines idling) - Let's call it a day. We've covered half the roads in this county. - Yeah. How about that ravine? That runs along here for about eight miles. We'll start from here, and you come from the other end. - Well, all right. - Right. (dramatic music) (tires squealing) (lizard hissing) (lizard hissing) (dramatic music) (lizard hissing) (ground rumbling) Sure is beat down around here. Look at that! - What is it, Chase? - Looks like an animal of some sort drug something along here. - You mean a wild animal here? - Sure, could be anything, even a mountain lion. Come on. (dramatic music) (lizard hissing) (ground rumbling) (lizard hissing) (dramatic music) (ground rumbling) (lizard hissing) Thirsty? - Yes, but haven't we gone far enough, Chase? - Phew that's bitter. Must have an awful lot of mineral in it. - Come on, let's go. - Wait a minute. Let's take a breather first. - Chase, I don't like this place. Let's go back. - Are you afraid? Now you come on over here with me and sit in the shade, and I'll you a story. (car honking) That's Gordy maybe they've found something! Come on, let's go! (dramatic music) (horn honking) - It's Pat's car at the bottom of the wash, two or three miles back by the old reservoir. - Were they in it? - No, nothing. - Drive me back to my car, and I'll bring up the wrecker. (engine cranks) (dramatic music) (branches snapping) (ground rumbling) - I wonder what that was. - Oh, probably just a little rock slide. - For some reason this place gives me the creeps. It always has. (lizard hissing) - Lisa. Turn the motor on. The wench is already engaged. Now, if I yell, turn the key off. - [Lisa] Okay. (engine cranks) - Okay? Go ahead. (engine revving) Go ahead. Give it some more. Okay, keep going. Keep going. (lizard hissing) Attagirl. Keep it going. Keep it going you're doing fine. (lizard hissing) (dramatic music) Attagirl. Attagirl, keep it going. You doing fine. (lizard hissing) You did fine, honey. - It's a little beat up, but it'll tow all right. - Yeah, we'll meet you back at the garage, okay? - Let's go, Jenny. (lizard hissing) (engine cranks) (engine revving) - See you later. (birds chirping) - [Sheriff] Where did you find it? - By the reservoir in Williams Wash. They weren't in it. There's no sign of blood or anything. You know, I think they were thrown clear. - Did you search the area? - Yeah, Gordy went down the ravine for about a mile, and, well, we looked beyond the wreck for a couple hundred yards. Wouldn't you say, Gordy? - At least that far. - Did you see any footprints? - No, none. - This thing's bent around just about the same as that sedan, like it'd been hit with a 10-ton rubber mount. - It's a pretty rough trip down that cliff. That could have done it. - Yeah, I'll have to go over that area with a rake. - You know, I've been thinking. If Liz and Pat had eloped, they wouldn't have take his car because Old Man Wheeler would have it traced right off. - Well, maybe he stole it, Chase, and then it was stolen. - Yeah, if it was stolen and somebody parked it there, well, the brakes could have faded, and it rolled off the edge. - It'd be a strange coincidence if they came back to this part of the county. The possibility makes some sense, though. I'll get my gear and dust for fingerprints. Gosh, I wish you boys had have called me before you drug it out. I might have found some clues to help us out. - I'm sorry, Sheriff. - The hard part's telling Mr. Wheeler. I sure dread that. - It's not like we found them there. - He's sure gonna raise Ned because I don't find this wreck sooner. Where's Mr. Compton? - He went down to the field with a load of fuel oil. He'll be back in two or three hours. I'm gonna close up. - I'll see you later. (birds chirping) (whistling softly) (lizard hissing) (screaming loudly) (metal crashes) (explosion booming) (suspenseful music) (lizard hissing) (crickets chirping) - Sorry I'm late. - Now, Chase Winstead. Just a minute jot so fast there. - What for? (woman chuckles) Did you ever play football? - With the Green Bay Packers. - Hike! - Oh, Chase, put me down. - No, not till you tell me what's going on. - All right, if you close your eyes. - All right, I don't know what's happening, but they're closed. - Keep them closed. - They're closed. This is silly. - Now, open them. (gentle music) - Look what Lisa got me. Stay there, Chase. Watch. Stay there, Chase. I can get up. Stay there. - [Chase] That was wonderful, baby. Just wonderful. - But I've been practicing all afternoon, ever since Lisa brought the braces over, and I walked all the way, twice. I wanted to do it right for you. (Chase laughs) - Would you like to hear a song? (gentle music) ♪ There was a mushroom ♪ ♪ Sad little mushroom ♪ ♪ And there was a meadow ♪ ♪ Ready to cry ♪ ♪ There was a sparrow ♪ ♪ Gray little sparrow ♪ ♪ And there was an eagle ♪ ♪ Silent and high ♪ ♪ And the Lord said ♪ ♪ Laugh, children laugh ♪ ♪ The Lord said laugh, children, laugh ♪ ♪ The Lord said, laugh, children, laugh ♪ ♪ The Lord said laugh, laugh, laugh ♪ ♪ Then the Lord he said I created for you ♪ ♪ A world from out of the blue ♪ ♪ And all that is left to complete the joy ♪ ♪ Just the laugh of a girl and boy ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ And there was a garden ♪ ♪ Beautiful garden ♪ ♪ Held in the arms of a world without joy ♪ ♪ Then there was laughter ♪ ♪ Wonderful laughter ♪ ♪ For he created a girl and a boy ♪ ♪ And the Lord said, laugh, children, laugh ♪ ♪ The Lord said, laugh, children, laugh ♪ ♪ The Lord said, laugh, children, laugh ♪ ♪ The Lord said laugh, children, laugh ♪ ♪ The Lord said laugh, children, laugh ♪ ♪ The Lord said laugh, children, laugh ♪ ♪ The Lord said laugh, children, laugh ♪ ♪ The Lord laugh ♪ ♪ Yay ♪ ♪ Yay ♪ ♪ Yay ♪ (gentle music) - Laughing's important, isn't it, Chase? - It sure is, and, you know, I never felt any more like laughing than I do right now. I didn't think you'd be able to do that good in a week. - Didn't you really? - Honest. But, you know, you're gonna have to work real hard, and you mustn't be disappointed if it takes a long time, okay? - That's enough for one day, Missy. It's your bedtime. - Do I have to, Chase? - You sure do. Show me how you can walk. - Goodnight, Lisa. (gentle music) (door thuds) - That was a wonderful thing for you to do, Lisa. - I wanted to. - Now you're broke, aren't you? I was gonna pick them up in the morning. - I know. When you showed me that money I was afraid you'd get there first. - Well, I'm still gonna pay you for them. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. (phone rings) Hello? Yeah, Sheriff. Well, he should have been back an hour ago. No. Where? That's awful. No, it couldn't be Mr. Compton. All right. At the garage? All right, I'm leaving now. - What is it, Chase? - It's a wreck, and oil truck. It could be Mr. Compton. Honey, I'm awfully sorry, but I've got to leave. (engine rumbling) - Here he comes now, Sheriff. - Come on. - Wait a minute, Sheriff. You've got a sore foot. - Oh, no. - We can take my Model A. She's all shiny and bright brand new. - No, we'll take my car. - Come on, Harris. - Did you see it? - No, I didn't see it, but I sure heard about it. - Can I open this thing up? - Yeah, go ahead. (engine cranks) (engine revving) (sheriff mouthing words) (insects chirping) (fire crackling) That's Compton's rig! - [Sheriff] Be careful, it's pretty hot. - He's not in it. - He may have been hurt and crawled away. Let's look around. Come on, Harris! - Okay. - Compton! Mr. Compton! - Find anything, Sheriff? - Well, let's go over this again. How did you get into the act? - I told you once. - Well, tell me again. - Well, I was barrelling along in my Model A. She don't look like much now, but she was a beauty when I first-- - The accident. - Still go though. Get up to 60. - The accident. Just the accident. - Well, I'll tell you. - I wish you would. - This feller seen the headlights coming up the grade towards him, and all of a sudden they come at you going over and over, and then blewy. Blewy, she blew up! Well, he seen somebody is in a might of trouble, so he come in the store talking about it. That's when I offered to call you. - Did you get the name of the witness? - No. - Did he see anything else? - Nope. - Do you wanna wait in the car for us? - No. - Well, you're going to anyway. - Okay, Sheriff. Okay. Like you say, always obey the law. Do this, do that. Somebody tells you no... - Any luck, Chase? - No, nothing. - Pat and Liz might have eloped, but Compton ought to be around here. - Maybe he's in the hospital. - No, I checked there before I left my place. Would Compton have any reason to want to get lost? - No, none that I can think of. - You would have no reason to know about this, but there's been a lot of livestock missing lately. One here, one there. That doesn't make headlines, but now it's people. - Do you think there's a tie-up? - I don't know. What we need is a criminal investigator, and headquarters won't send one down here. - Well, maybe they will now. - Yeah, maybe. Did you notice those skid marks? Just like the others, straight across the road. If it'd been hit by another vehicle, the paint would be knocked off. What batters a car around like it was a toy? - How's the barn coming along for the party? - All right, I'll be done in about an hour or so. Say, you and Chase sure got off light. He took off this morning. You've just sitting around here on your can all day long. That barn was a place to clean. - You get the hi-fi set up? - Yeah. - [Steamroller] Well, you steamboats and dreamboats. - [Teen In Brown] That's Steamroller Smith. He's the most. - [Steamroller] Steamroller here at KILT. Now if any of you round rocks get lonesome for my voice, I'll be MC'ing a platter party tonight out at Hargitay's Barn on Route 43. Drop in, I'll flatten you. - Hey, man, that's us. We got the steamroller coming out. - That's where Chase has been all day. Getting steamroller! - This will be a blast. - How about that guy? (engine rumbling) (lively music plays on radio) Say little man, you sure had a busy day. - Getting that paint job and Steamroller Smith. - Now how'd you guys find out about Steamroller Smith? - Well, he just said so on his program. Said it right out on the network. - Well, I wanted it to be a surprise. Well come on, don't spread around, huh? How are the preparations coming? - Oh, that'll be finished about 45 minutes. The gang won't start arriving from east until 9:30. - We're under the wire with time to spare. - No sweat. (gasps deeply) ♪ Oh, I hate the ground you walk on, little darling ♪ ♪ For all them things that you have did to me ♪ ♪ Oh, you nagged me till you're hoarse ♪ ♪ So I'm suing for divorce ♪ ♪ Little darling I'll forget your memory ♪ (chuckles softly) (indistinct) It's good. (train whistle blows) Come on, Tessie Belle. Let's go. (engine revving) (train whistle blowing) (engine rumbling) (dramatic music) (lizard hissing) (bridge rattling) (lizard hissing) (ground rumbling) (lizard hissing) (engine rumbling) (lizard hissing) (crash booming) (women screaming) (suspenseful music) (lizard hissing) (dramatic music) (passenger shouting) - That's the same story a man down here told me. Something real strange must have happened down there. Oh, yeah, yeah. He'll be here if you want him. Right. Sit down, Harris. - You be going down to the wreck, Sheriff? - No, that's not in my territory. Headquarters already have a report. The troopers will take care of that. Harris, tell me again about the train wreck. - Well, I was driving around quiet like in my Model A. Bought it in '32 for-- - Just a minute. Just a minute. I ask you what time it is, and you tell me how to build a clock. Just the facts about the wreck. - Well, I was driving along quiet like. - The wreck. - Then I turned around and come back down here and told you about it. - Give me your keys, Harris. - Keys? My keys. What for? - For spinning a yarn like that and driving while drunk. - I demand a soberty test. - That does it. Go lock yourself up. - I demand a soberty test, because I ain't been drinking. (Harris belches) Well, a least not as heavy. Whatever you think's right. Which way is the cell? Which way? Well, you can't win them all, can you, Sheriff? - Call your wife if you want to, Harris. - What? (scoffs) Are you crazy, Sheriff? (sheriff gasps) (engine rumbles) (insects chirping) ♪ My baby she rocks and rolls ♪ ♪ And rocks whenever she talks ♪ - Chase. - Hey, you gonna leave home? - I'm going to spend the night with the Blackwells. Mommy said it was all right. Will you take me over? - Well, I don't know, Missy. Gosh, that's two or three miles outta my way. Aw, sure, we will. - Chase. What in the world have you done to that car of yours? - It's a new fuel mixture you like it? - I just barely touched the gas pedal, and the back wheel started to spin. Why, I was two blocks down the road before I even knew I'd left home. - Come on, Mom, I'm just trying to make a hot rodder out of you. (telephone rings) I'll get it. Hello? Yeah, hello, Sheriff. A what? Book on reptiles? Yeah, I guess I still have it around here somewhere. Yeah, sure. I have to take Missy over by the Blackwells. I'll stop by on my way to pick up Lisa, okay? - Well, now I'm gonna tell you something you don't know. I've been talking to a zoologist, and the Gila monster size is controlled, like everything else, by a sort of thyroid or pituitary gland. Sometimes a change in diet can throw the balance all outta whack. Either the cells breakdown too fast or build up too slow, and this subset makes either runts or giants out of them. - Good, but what's that mean to me? - Well, I'm coming to that. The zoologist also told me about a doctor that just found the bones of some huge animals down in Tanganyika, and the theory was that they lived in river delta country, and certain salts that had washed into the valley had been absorbed by the plants and then transferred to the animals. causing them to be giants. - Hmm. All right. - Yeah, I know. I probably sound a little bit like Harris, but let me tell the whole thing in my own words. There was another report out of Russia or the Ukraine. It was in the paper a couple months ago, maybe you saw it, about a baby that weighed 130 pounds when it was 10 months old and was taller than its mother? - (whistles) Grew up to be a giant. - Yeah, and that same thing could happen right here. Did you see any footprints around any of those wrecks? - No. Gila monster footprints? - Yeah, a big one, about the size of a bus. - Oh, come on. Are you serious? - Well, I don't know. But Harris saw it, and some of the survivors of the train wreck saw it. A giant lizard. - Train wreck where? - [Sheriff] At the bridge over Wilson's Wash. - When? - Tonight, about an hour ago. The troopers were inclined to pass it off as shock or optical illusion. You can't always believe what Harris says. - A Gila monster, pink and black stripes. You know, I towed a guy in the other day and he said he'd been forced off the road by something like that. I didn't believe him, because he'd been drinking, and another thing when we were looking for Pat's car, we saw where something had been drug down the wash. You know, if they could have gotten that big, they could have knocked Mr. Compton's truck off that road. They could've gotten him. - I shouldn't have told you about this until after the party. But I just thought you'd want to know. - Hadn't we better warn everybody? - No. It operates in and around the Wash. Troopers have got that staked off for a couple of miles. Just keep it to yourself. It might cause panic. - Okay, Sheriff, whatever you say. - Try and forgot it for now, and have some fun, will you, boy? - Yeah. (lively music playing) All right, hold it! Hold it, all you jumping beans! (crowd groaning) Now, I've got a surprise for you. We got the king of the DJs. (crowd gasping) Now, you've all heard him on his platter show on KILT. That's right! Steamroller Smith! (crowd cheering) - Hi. Okay, your Old Dad here has some small words and some great records. I want you to have a ball tonight. Let's begin with one of the top KILT survey songs. What do you say now let's everybody dance. Here we go. Let's go, everybody. (bright dance music) - Yeah. Now do you mind telling me what this is all about? - Have you been down to the train wreck? - No. - Well, I have. I talked to a trooper about my son's car. He said it shouldn't have been moved until a thorough investigation had been made, and it had been photographed. This wasn't done, was it, Sheriff? I thought not. It was removed and clues lost without authority. You didn't put that in your report, did you, Sheriff? Of course you didn't, and I'll tell you why. You were protecting that Chase Winstead, covering him regardless of the effect it might have on others. - Chase was only trying to help. He's your son's friend, probably the best one he ever had. Of course, it wasn't in the report. What good would it do? Any kid can make a mistake, Mr. Wheeler, even yours. - But Sheriff, it's my son that's missing. Let me ask you something else. Have you heard the reports about a giant lizard? You believe them? - I don't know, Mr. Wheeler. It doesn't seem possible. - Well, why not, there have been giants before. - That's true. But how could anything that big go unnoticed in this area? - Have you ever walked the length of William's Wash? - No. - Do you know anybody that has? - No. - That area is so choked with underbrush, it isn't even good hunting ground, and I say it is possible for a giant lizard to have lived there for years without being seen. Now, if that is the case, my son's dead. So is Compton. I can't blame you for what's happened to Pat, but Compton's death is on your hands. - How did you come to that conclusion? - I'll tell you how. His truck was found only two miles beyond Pat's car, and if you'd have investigated that area thoroughly as you're paid to do, Compton might not have died. Well? Now come out here I wanna show you something else. Now something may have hit this car. But it didn't take the tires off, and where did those new white sidewalls on Chase Winstead's hot rod come from? - Here, I guess. There was a towing charge against-- He presumed the bill wouldn't be paid, so he borrowed the tires in the meantime? - Perhaps. - That's thievery! Destroying evidence and obstructing justice! Now, your last official act of office will be to arrest that boy and bring him in, and I'll go along to make sure that it's done. (dramatic music) (engine revving) (dramatic music) (lively music playing) (conversing softly) - Hey, kids, a fellow dropped in over at KILT the other day and played me a great new song. I thought it was just fine. I wanna play it for you. We got a little pickup group together and cut a demo of this guy. I wanna play it for you now and see what you think about it. By the way, the first person who identifies the singer on the record gets two free rides on my elephant in Bangkok, Siam. (all chuckles) But you gotta pay your own way over there and back. (crowd groans) Okay, here it is now. See what you think of it. ("I Ain't Made That Way") ♪ Cause, baby, I ain't made that way ♪ ♪ No, baby, I ain't made that way ♪ ♪ But if your madden heart desires ♪ ♪ Well, I can give you golden fire ♪ ♪ Yes, I can give you golden fire ♪ (crowd groans) - Don't give up tar and feathers yet. I'm gonna play the rest of it. How do you like it? (crowd cheering) Okay, who's the singer? - Elvis. One of the Everleys. - Bill Darnell. - Kate Smith. - Very funny, but you lose. Look, the same guy you hear singing on the record also wrote the song. Now who is it? Does anybody know? - We don't know who is it? - Okay, okay. It's going to come out on records in a couple of months, and you can find his name on the label. (crowd groaning) - I know who it is. - [Girl] Who? (crowd clamoring) - Who is it, Lisa? Come on tell us. - Chase did it! (crowd groans) - You did it, Chase? - Why didn't you say something? - You didn't tell us. - Well, I didn't know if there was anything I'd want to admit to. (crowd shouting) - Come on up here, boy. (crowd applauding) All right. Okay, hold it, hold it. Quiet, everybody. Also, up at the station the other day Chase played me another little song. It's kind of different from this one, but I imagine with a little coaxing, you know, by hitting your hands together like this, he might give you a little preview of it. What do you say?

(girls screaming) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (lizard hissing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (lizard screeching) (gun firing) (gun firing) (lizard hissing) (suspenseful music) What'll it take to stop that thing? - I don't know, but I'm going down to the train wreck and get some troopers. If we pump enough lead into that thing, we may hit a vulnerable spot. Wheeler, you're gonna have to give me a hand. - But how? - Keep these kids here. I don't want anybody roaming around. (suspenseful music) - Where are we going? - Storage shed. I've got an idea that might work. (engine revving) - You been after this. Now you've got it. You're deputized. Listen, kids. Wheeler's my deputy? You'll take your orders from him. Arrest anybody that tries to get away. (engine cranks) - Sheriff says this is the place to stay. But we're not staying here. - That's right. - I'll have to arrest anyone that leaves. (teens clamoring) (tires screeching) (engine revving) (dramatic music) - Now you take these keys and wait inside the office till I get back. I told you to wait inside. Why don't you do what I tell you? I haven't got much time. - You're not going to leave me, Chase. I'm going to help. - Do you know what's in here? Nitroglycerin. Enough to blow up half this town. - It doesn't matter. I'm still going to help. - Holy. All right, now take these, hold them, and don't let them bump, and for heaven sakes don't drop them. Now hold those. (dramatic music) (engine cranks) (suspenseful music) (tires screeching) Boy, he went through here, all right. Now, they generally travel in a straight line. (suspenseful music) Good Lord, he's hit the Blackwell home! That's where Missy is! Mrs. Blackwell? Missy? Missy? Mrs. Blackwell! Missy! Hang on to that nitro we're cutting across! (sirens blaring) (ground rumbling) (suspenseful music) Keep that stuff still. Do you want to blow us up? There they are. - [Lisa] Where is Missy? - Missy! It's all right, Missy! It's all right! Lisa, get Missy and hold her down, and both of you lie flat! (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) (ground rumbling) (lizard hissing) (explosion booming) (fire crackling) (siren wailing) Are you all right? - I was scared, Chase. - That's okay, honey. - I tore my new dress. - Oh, we can get you a new dress. - A hundred dresses. - Everybody all right? - Yeah. - On the way back we picked up his trail, followed him across country. (eerie music) What did you hit him with? - My brand new, 100% completed hot rod. - You'd have to start the next county to get up enough momentum to do that to him. - Not with four quarts of nitroglycerin riding with you. - You rode across that rough field carrying nitro? - Yes, sir! - Do you know what could have happened to you? - It did. I lost my car. - Oh, don't worry about that. Railroad will be glad to buy you a new one. (gentle music) (engines rumbling) - Did you see me run, Chase, did you see it? - I sure did, Missy. You were really travelling. (upbeat music) - I thought I told you to keep those kids up at the barn? - Well, how do you arrest a bunch of kids going in all different directions? - Do you realize what would have happened if that thing had turned back? - Same thing that happened to Pat. Sheriff, your job is a much bigger one than I thought. Since Compton's gone, I guess Chase is out of a job. - That's right. - Would you make it a point to have the boy come around and see me in the morning? - I'll bring him around in the morning.
