The Wonderful World of Disney presents a tale as old as time, starring H.E.R. as Belle, Josh Groban as the Beast, Joshua Henry as Gaston, Martin Short as Lumière, Shania Twain as Mrs. Potts, David Alan Grier as Cogsworth, Jon Jon Briones as Maurice, Rizwan Manji as LeFou, and Leo Abelo Perry as Chip. Beauty and the Beast: A 30th Celebration starts now. Once upon a time in a faraway land, a young prince lived in a shining castle. Although he had everything his heart desired, the prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind. But then, one winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away. But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress. The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that there was no love in his heart. And as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there. Ashamed of his monstrous form, the Beast concealed himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world. The rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose, which would bloom until his 21st year. If he could learn to love another and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time. As the years passed, he fell into despair and lost all hope, for who could ever learn to love a beast? Welcome, everyone, to the 30th anniversary celebration of Walt Disney Animation Studios' Oscar-winning, animated masterpiece, Beauty and the Beast. You are in for such a special treat as we present the animated movie we all know and love with the musical numbers reimagined as live-action spectacles. And for the Disney fan in all of us, we are going to have some rare looks behind the curtain, showing you just how this classic film came to be from right here on the Disney Studios backlot, where the inspiration first struck to create this landmark film, one that has brought magic into the lives of countless people all around the globe. And that legacy began on this very ground with an artist, an idea, and a pencil. Little town, it's a quiet village Every day like the one before Little town full of little people Waking up to say... - Bonjour. - Bonjour. - Bonjour. - Bonjour. There goes the baker With his tray like always The same old bread and rolls to sell Every morning, just the same Since the morning that we came To this poor provincial town - Good morning, Belle. - Good morning, monsieur. - And where are you off to? - The book shop. I just finished the most wonderful story about a beanstalk and an ogre. That's nice. Marie, the baguettes! Hurry up. Look, there she goes That girl is strange, no question Dazed and distracted, can't you tell Never part of any crowd 'Cause her head's up on some cloud No denying She's a funny girl that Belle -Bonjour -Good day How is your family -Bonjour -Good day. How is your wife -I need six eggs -That's too expensive There must be more Than this provincial life - Oh, Belle. - Good morning. I've come to return the book that I borrowed. - Finished already? - Oh, I couldn't put it down. - Have you got anything new? - Not since yesterday. Oh, that's all right. I'll borrow this one. - That one? But you've read it twice. - Well, it's my favorite. Far-off places, daring sword fights, magic spells, - a prince in disguise. - If you like it all that much, it's yours. - But madame... - I insist. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Look, there she goes That girl is so peculiar I wonder if she's feeling well With a dreamy, far-off look And her nose stuck in a book What a puzzle To the rest of us is Belle Oh Isn't this amazing It's my favorite part Because you'll see Here's where she meets Prince Charming But she won't discover that it's him Till chapter three Now, it's no wonder That her name means beauty Her looks have got no parallel But behind that fair façade I'm afraid she's rather odd Very different from the rest of us She's nothing like the rest of us Yes, different from the rest of us Is Belle Ah! Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston. You're the greatest hunter in the whole world! I know. No beast stands a chance against you... - or any girl, for that matter. - That's right, LeFou, and I've got my sights set on that one. The inventor's daughter? She's the one, the lucky girl I'm going to marry. - But she's... - The most beautiful girl in town! - I know! - And that means she's the best. And don't I deserve the best? Of course. I mean, you do, but I mean... Right from the moment that I met her Saw her I said, "She's gorgeous" -And I fell Here in town, there's only she Who is beautiful as me So I'm making plans To woo and marry Belle Look, there he goes Isn't he dreamy Monsieur Gaston Oh, he's so cute Be still, my heart I'm hardly breathing He's such a tall, dark Strong and handsome brute - Bonjour. - Pardon! -Good day. You call this bacon - Some cheese. - Ten yards. - One pound. - Excuse me! -I'll get the knife -Please let me through This bread, it's stale -This fish -They smell -Madame's mistaken -Well, maybe so There must be more Than this provincial life Just watch I'm going to make Belle my wife Look, there she goes That girl is strange, but special A most peculiar mademoiselle It's a pity and a sin She doesn't quite fit in 'Cause she really is a funny girl A beauty, but a funny girl She really is a funny girl That Belle That Belle That Belle Beauty and the Beast! I'm a huge Beauty and the Beast fan. I've been listening to it since I was a little kid. My first memory of seeing Beauty and the Beast, when it came out, I was ten. Most stories that touch your heart when you're young, you never want it to end, and that's why another incarnation is always exciting. -Ow. I think it's gonna be really fun, man. Just look at the cast. Oh, my gosh, I love Shania Twain. - Oh, my... Martin Short. - H.E.R. is brilliant. DAVID: What I like most about H.E.R. is she plays guitar, and she's good. This is the dream team to end all dream teams. It's the party of a lifetime. It's gonna be really, really special. I can't wait. One of my favorite parts of tonight's celebration is the chance for all of us to take a look behind the curtain and experience Beauty and the Beast the same way the film's animators did when they first put pencil to paper. So here, for the very first time, is a scene you will be familiar with, only in a way you have never experienced it before. -MAURICE: This is it, Belle! This time is it! I'll win first prize at the fair this year. Oh, Papa, it works! -You did it! I always knew you were a genius! MAURICE: Well, I don't know if I'd qualify as a... -BELLE: You'd better hurry. It's a long ride to the fair. Goodbye, Papa! Good luck! Goodbye, Belle! Take care while I'm gone! -I should be there by now. -Maybe we missed a turn. I guess I should have taken the... wait a minute. Come on, Philippe. It's a shortcut. -This can't be right. Where have you taken us, Philippe? We better turn around. Steady. Oh, no, Philippe! Oh, no. -Who's there? Is someone there? Show yourself at once! Oh, dear! Shoo! Help! Philippe, help me! They're gonna eat me! Stay! Oh, my! Oh, no, no! Let's all calm down. Oh, dear. Enough. Help! Is someone there? -What? What is... Oh... Hello? Hello? Poor fellow must have lost his way in the woods. Keep quiet. Maybe he'll go away. Is someone there? Not a word, Lumière, not one word. I don't mean to intrude, but I've lost my horse, and... and I need a place to stay for the night. - Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart. - Shh! - Ah, ah, ah, ow! - Oh, of course, monsieur, - you are welcome here. - Who said that? - Over here! - Where? -Hello. - How is this accomplished? - Put me down at once. Stop that. Stop that, I say. Oh, you are soaked to the bone, monsieur. - Come, warm yourself by the fire. - Thank you. COGSWORTH: No, no, no. You know what the master will do if he finds him here. I demand that you stop right there. -Well, hello there, boy. What service. -All right... How would you like a nice spot of tea, sir? It'll warm you up in no time. No. No tea. No tea! His mustache tickles, Mama! Oh! Hello. -Uh-oh. -There's a stranger here. Master, allow me to explain. The gentleman was lost in the woods. -He was cold and wet, so... Mm, Master, I'd like to take this moment to say I was against this from the start. It was all his fault. I tried to stop them. Would they listen to me? No, no... Is that... -Who are you? What are you doing here? I-I-I was lost in the woods, and... - You are not welcome here! - I-I-I'm sorry. - What are you staring at? - N-nothing. So you've come to stare at the Beast, have you? Please! I meant no harm! I-I just needed a place to stay. - I'll give you a place to stay. - No, no, please! No, no! Gaston. What a pleasant surprise. Isn't it, though? I'm just full of surprises. You know, Belle, there's not a girl in town who wouldn't love to be in your shoes. This is the day... hmm... -Ah. This is the day your dreams come true. What do you know about my dreams, Gaston? Plenty. Here, picture this. A rustic hunting lodge. My latest kill roasting on the fire. And my little wife massaging my feet, while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs. We'll have six or seven. - Dogs? - No, Belle. - Strapping boys, like me. - Imagine that. And do you know who that little wife will be? - Let me think. - You, Belle. Gaston, I'm... I'm... speechless. I really don't know what to say. - Say you'll marry me. - I'm very sorry, Gaston, but... but I just don't deserve you. -Whoa! So how'd it go? I'll have Belle for my wife. -Make no mistake about that. -Touchy. ("PLAYING) Can you imagine? He asked me to marry him. Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless... Madame Gaston Can't you just see it Madame Gaston, his little wife No, sir, not me, I guarantee it I want much more Than this provincial life I want adventure In the great wide, somewhere I want it more than I can tell And for once, it might be grand To have someone understand I want so much more Than they've got planned Hello, hello. Now we are getting into character, eh? Besides, they must fall in love tonight if we ever expect to be human again. I've got my heart set on marrying Belle. -Philippe! -What are you doing here? Where's... Where's Papa? Where is he, Philippe? What happened? Oh, we have to find him. You have to take me to him. What is this place? Philippe, please. Steady. Steady. Papa... Hello? Is anyone here? Papa, are you here? Did you see that? - It's a girl! - Yes, I can see it's a girl. But don't you see? She's the one! The girl we've been waiting for. She's come to break the spell. Wait a minute. Wait just a minute. Didn't you invite the last guest in? And you-know-who was furious. Why are you getting so wound up? You're the one who keeps saying, "Oh, all this waiting is making me go cuckoo, cuckoo." Clock jokes? Really, Lumière? You must have burned the candle at both ends, coming up with those. Come on. The clock is ticking. Oh, that's clever. My, you're a thinker. I would never have thought you could do that. Papa? Belle? Oh, you must leave here at once. Now, go before he finds you. - Who? - What are you doing here? - Run, Belle. - I've come for my father. -Please let him out. Can't you see he's sick? Then he shouldn't have trespassed here. There's nothing you can do. He's my prisoner. There must be some way I can... -Wait. Take me instead. You... would take his place? Belle, no. You don't know what you're doing. If I agree, you must promise to stay here forever. Come into the light. Belle. I won't let you do this. You have my word. Done. No, Belle! No, please spare my daughter. Please! She's no longer your concern. -Take him to the village. Let me out! Please let me out! Let me out, please! Please! You didn't even let me say goodbye. I'll never see him again. And I didn't get to say goodbye. - I'll show you to your room. - My room? But I thought... You wanna... you wanna stay in the tower? - No. - Then follow me. Say something to her. Huh? Oh. I... hope you like it here. The castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you like except the west wing. - What's in the west... - It's forbidden! Now, if you need anything, my servants will attend you. Dinner. Invite her to dinner. You will join me for dinner. That's not a request! Who does she think she is? That girl has tangled with the wrong man! - No one says no to Gaston. - Darn right. Dismissed, rejected, publicly humiliated! - It's more than I can bear. - More beer? What for? Nothing helps. - I'm disgraced. - Who, you? Never! Gaston, you gotta pull yourself together. -Gosh, it disturbs me To see you, Gaston Looking so down in the dumps -Every guy here'd love To be you, Gaston, even when taking your lumps There's no man in town As admired as you You're everyone's favorite guy Everyone's awed and inspired by you And it's not very hard To see why -No one's slick as Gaston No one's quick as Gaston No one's neck's as incredibly Thick as Gaston's For there's no man in town Half as manly... Perfect, a pure paragon You can ask any Tom, Dick, or Stanley And they'll tell you whose team They prefer to be on No one's big like Gaston A kingpin like Gaston No one's got a swell cleft In his chin like Gaston As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating My what a guy that Gaston Give five hurrahs, give 12 hip-hips Gaston is the best -And the rest is all drips -Yeah. Oh. ALL: No one fights like Gaston Douses lights like Gaston In a wrestling match Nobody fights like Gaston For there's no one as burly and brawny As you see I've got biceps to spare Not a bit of him's scraggly or scrawny That's right! And every last inch of me's Covered with hair No one hits like Gaston Matches wits like Gaston In a spitting match, Nobody spits like Gaston I'm especially good at expectorating - Ptooey! - ALL: Ten points for Gaston When I was a lad, I ate four dozen eggs Every morning to help me get large And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs So I'm roughly the size Of a barge No one shoots like Gaston - No one! - Makes those beauts -Like Gaston -Then goes tromping around Wearing boots like Gaston I use antlers In all of my decorating My what a guy Gaston Help! Someone help me! He's got her. He's got her locked in a dungeon. Oh, we must go. Not a minute to lose! Whoa, whoa. Slow down, Maurice. - Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon? - A beast! A horrible, monstrous beast! My daughter's life is in danger. Why do you laugh? The Beast is real! Will no one help me? All right, old man. We'll help you out. Oh, you will? Oh, thank you. Oh. Thank you. Thank you. -Crazy old Maurice. He's always good for a laugh. Crazy old Maurice, hmm? Crazy old Maurice. Hmm... -LeFou, I'm afraid I've been thinking A dangerous pastime. -I know. But that wacky old coot is Belle's father And his sanity's only so-so Now the wheels in my head Have been turning -Since I looked at that loony old man See, I promised myself I'd be married to Belle And right now I'm evolving a plan - If I... - Yes? - Then we... - No, will she? - Yes. - Now I get it. Let's go! No one plots like Gaston Takes cheap shots like Gaston Plans to persecute harmless Crackpots like Gaston So his marriage We soon will be celebrating My, what a guy, Gaston Hmm? There has to be some way we can cheer up Belle. - Help her see the bright side. - I've got it! Why don't you show her your little TikTok dance? That always cheers me up. It's not a dance. It's the way I walk. And tick-tock is the sound I make when I move. Ah. Oh, I'm suddenly happy. - Who is it? - MRS. POTTS: Mrs. Potts, dear. -I thought you might like... - A spot of tea. - But you're... - you're a... - Oh! - Careful. - This is impossible. I know it is, but here we are. That was a very brave thing you did, my dear. We all think so. But I've lost my father, my dreams, everything. Cheer up, child. It'll turn out all right in the end. You'll see. Oh, listen to me, jabbering on while there's a supper to get on the table. Chip! Bye! What's taking so long? I told her to come down. Why isn't she here yet? Oh, try to be patient, sir. The girl has lost her father and her freedom all in one day. Master, have you thought that perhaps this girl - could be the one to break the spell? - Of course I have! - I'm not a fool. - Good. So you fall in love with her, she falls in love with you, and poof, the spell is broken. We'll be human again by midnight. Oh, it's not that easy, Lumière. These things take time. But the rose has already begun to wilt. Oh, it's no use. She's so beautiful, and I'm... well, look at me! Oh, you must help her to see past all that. I don't know how. Well, you can start by making yourself more presentable. Straighten up. Try to act like a gentleman. Ah, yes. When she comes in, give her a dashing, debonair smile. Come, come. Show me the smile. - But don't frighten the poor girl. - Impress her with your rapier wit. But be gentle. - Shower her with compliments. - MRS. POTTS: But be sincere. And above all... You must control your temper. -Here she is. Good evening. Well? Where is she? What? But Your Grace, Your Eminence... let's not be hasty! I thought I told you to come down to dinner. I'm not hungry. You'll come out, or I'll... I'll... I'll break down the door! Master, I could be wrong, but, uh... That may not be the best way to win the girl's affections. Please, attempt to be a gentleman. It would give me great pleasure if you would join me for dinner. We say please. - Please. - No, thank you. You can't stay in there forever. - Yes, I can. - Fine! Then go ahead and starve! If she doesn't eat with me, then she doesn't eat at all. -Oh, dear. That didn't go very well at all, did it? What does she want me to do? Beg? Show me the girl. But the master's really not so bad once you get to know him. Why don't you give him a chance? I don't want to get to know him. I don't want to have anything to do with him. I'm just fooling myself. She'll never see me as anything but a monster. It's hopeless. The falling petals of an enchanted rose, each one a graceful reminder that love is as fragile as it is enduring, as difficult to find as it is a wonder to hold onto. That true love can overcome any obstacles no matter how impossible they may seem. It is this idea that inspired Walt Disney himself to want to tell the story of Beauty and the Beast as far back as the 1930s. For decades, Disney artists worked to adapt this tale as old as time, yet something was always missing from these early efforts. Then, more than 50 years after inspiration first struck, a team came together that was just as special as the fairy tale itself. Dancing again, we'll be twirling again - Yeah. - Want that faster? - Yeah. - Composer Alan Menken, lyricist Howard Ashman, and the team at Walt Disney Animation Studios found the missing spark. Together with Linda Woolverton, the first woman ever to write an animated feature for Disney, they brought the story to life not simply through words, but through music, and were finally able to deliver on Walt Disney's dream. Roy Disney himself wrote the film's prologue. Together, they embraced all the joy of Belle becoming the hero of her own story... I want excitement and adventure in my life. And I want someone to share it with. And the magic of the Beast and his enchanted castle. Beauty and the Beast has become one of the most beloved animated classics ever made. It was even the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. And to this day, Walt Disney's original idea continues to inspire us all. Come on, Chip, into the cupboard with your brothers and sisters. - But I'm not sleepy. - Yes, you are. -No, I'm not. Well, if you ask me, she was just being stubborn. After all, he did say "please." But if the master doesn't learn to control that temper, - He'll never break... - Splendid to see you out and about, mademoiselle. I am Cogsworth, head of the household. -Ah. - This is Lumière. - Enchanté, chérie. If there's... stop that... anything we... please... can do to make your stay more comfortable... -Ow! - I am a little hungry. - You are? Hear that? She's hungry. Stoke the fire. Break out the silver. Wake the china. Remember what the master said? Oh, pish-posh. I'm not about to let the poor child go hungry. All right, fine. Glass of water, crust of bread, and then... Cogsworth, I am surprised at you. She's not a prisoner. She's our guest. We must make her feel welcome here. - Right this way, mademoiselle. - Well, keep it down. If the master finds out about this, it will be our necks. Of course, of course. But what is dinner without a little music? -Music? Ma cheré mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you here tonight. And now we invite you to relax and to pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents your dinner. Be our guest Be our guest Put our service to the test Tie a napkin 'round your neck, chérie And we'll provide the rest Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres Why, we only live to serve Try the gray stuff, it's delicious Don't believe me Ask the dishes They can sing, they can dance After all, miss, this is France And a dinner here is never second best Go on, unfold your menu Take a glance And then you'll be our guest Oui, our guest, be our guest Beef ragout, cheese soufflé Pie and pudding en flambé We'll prepare and serve with flair A culinary cabaret You're alone and you're scared But the banquet's all prepared No one's gloomy or complaining While the flatware is entertaining We tell jokes, I do tricks With my fellow candlesticks And it's all in perfect taste That you can bet Come on and lift your glass You've won your own free pass To be our guest If you're stressed It's fine dining we suggest Be our guest Be our guest, be our guest Life is so unnerving For a servant who's not serving He's not whole without a soul to wait upon Oh, those good old days When we were useful Suddenly those good old days are gone Ten years we've been rusting Needing so much more than dusting Needing exercise A chance to use our skills Most days we just lay Around the castle Flabby, fat, and lazy You walked in and oopsie-daisy Ma cheré mademoiselle, it is my honor to present my favorite cup of tea, the incomparable Mrs. Potts. It's a guest, it's a guest Sakes alive and I'll be blessed Wine's been poured And thank the Lord I've had the napkins freshly pressed With dessert, she'll want tea And my dear, that's fine with me While the cups do their soft-shoein' I'll be bubblin', I'll be brewin' I'll get warm, piping hot Heaven's sakes, is that a spot Clean it up, We want the company impressed We've got a lot to do Is it one lump or two For you, our guest -She's our guest -Oh, she's our guest -Be our guest -Be our guest, be our guest Our command is your request It's been years since we've had Anybody here and we're obsessed With your meal, with your ease Yes, indeed we aim to please While candlelight's still glowing Let us help you, we'll keep going Course by course One by one Till you shout, enough, I'm done Then we'll sing you Off to sleep as you digest Tonight you'll prop your feet up But for now, let's eat up -Be our guest -Be our guest -Be our guest -Be our guest Be our guest Please, be our guest Bravo. That was wonderful. Thank you, mademoiselle. It was wonderful. Wasn't it, everyone? Will you look at the time? Off to bed, off to bed. I'd like to look around. Perhaps you'd like to take me? I'm sure you know everything there is to know about the castle. Well, actually, yes, I do. Right this way. -As you can see... The pseudo façade was stripped away to reveal a minimalist Rococo design. -Note the unusual... inverted vaulted ceilings. This is yet another example of the late neoclassic Baroque period. And as I always say, if it's not Baroque, don't fix it. Mm. Uh, where was I? -As you were. Now then, if I may draw your attention to the flying buttresses above the... uh, mademoiselle? - What's up there? - Where? There? Oh, nothing. Absolutely nothing of interest at all in the west wing. Dusty, dull, very boring. Ah, so that's the west wing. -Nice going. - I wonder what he's hiding up there. - Hiding? The... the master is hiding nothing. Then it wouldn't be forbidden. Perhaps, uh, mademoiselle would like to, uh, uh, uh, see something else? We have exquisite tapestries dating all the way back to... - Maybe later. - Uh, the-the gardens? - Or-or the-the-the library, perhaps? - You have a library? Yes! Ye... oh, indeed. - With books. - Scads of books. - Mountains of books. - Forests of books. - Cascades. - Cloudbursts. -Swamps of books. More books than you'll ever be able to read in a lifetime. Books on every subject ever studied, by every author whoever set pen to paper. -Oh. - Why did you come here? - I... I'm sorry. - I warned you never to come here. - I didn't mean any harm. Do you realize what you could have done? -Please, stop. - Get out! - No! Get out! Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You saved me. Here, now. Oh, don't do that. -Just hold still. - That hurts! - If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much. Well, if you hadn't have run away, this wouldn't have happened. If you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away. Well, you shouldn't have been in the west wing. Well, you should learn to control your temper. Now hold still. - This might sting a little. - Hmm? By the way, thank you for saving my life. You're welcome. GASTON: It's like this. I've got my heart set on marrying Belle. But she needs a little persuasion. So you want me to throw her father into the asylum unless she agrees to marry you? Oh, that is despicable. I love it. If no one will help me, then I'll go back alone. Yeah. Is that everything? I don't care what it takes. I'll find that castle, and somehow, I'll get her out of there. I've never felt this way about anyone. I want to do something for her. But what? Well, there's the usual things... flowers, chocolates, promises you don't intend to keep. Ah, no, no. It has to be something very special. Something that sparks her interest. Wait a minute! Belle... there's something I want to show you. But first, you have to close your eyes. It's a surprise. - Can I open them? - No, no. Not yet. Wait here. Now can I open them? All right. Now. I can't believe it. I've never seen so many books in all my life. - You... you like it? - It's wonderful. Then it's yours. Oh, thank you so much. Would you look at that? I knew it would work. -What? What worked? It's very encouraging. - Isn't this exciting? - I didn't see anything. Come along, Chip. There's chores to be done in the kitchen. But what are they talking about? What's going on? Come on, Mom. There's something sweet and almost kind But he was mean and he was Coarse and unrefined And now he's dear and so unsure I wonder why I didn't see it there before She glanced this way, I thought I saw And when we touched She didn't shudder at my paw No, it can't be I'll just ignore But then she's never looked At me that way before New and a bit alarming Who'd have ever thought That this could be True that he's no Prince Charming But there's something in him That I simply didn't see -Well, who'd have thought -Well, bless my soul -Well, who'd have known -Well, who indeed And who'd have guessed They'd come together on their own -It's so peculiar -We'll wait and see A few days more There maybe something there That wasn't there before You know, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before. There may be something there That wasn't there before What's there, Mama? Shh. I'll tell you when you're older. They start with a handful of notes, crescendo in a symphony of imagination and creativity. The sweeping score and songs of Alan Menken. The unforgettable lyrics of Howard Ashman. Together, they helped lead a Disney animated musical renaissance with Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, and Aladdin. While Ashman tragically passed away before Beauty and the Beast was released, Menken has kept the spirit of their partnership alive through his music for Disney classics and beyond. Acclaimed as it is beloved, Menken and Ashman's work on Beauty and the Beast did far more than achieve a Tony nomination, four Grammys, and two Oscars. The Oscar goes to Alan Menken and Howard Ashman for "Beauty and the Beast" from Beauty and the Beast. NARRATOR: It struck a chord in all of us, inspiring fans of all ages, including some of the biggest names in the recording industry. And just wait until you hear the wonderful rendition of "Beauty and the Beast" that Shania Twain and eight-time Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken have in store. -Tonight is the night. I'm not sure I can do this. You don't have time to be timid. You must be bold, daring. Bold. Daring. There will be music, romantic candlelight, provided by myself. And when the moment is right, you confess your love. Yes. I con... I... I... no, I can't. You care for the girl, don't you? -More than anything. Well, then you must tell her. Voilà. Oh, you look so... so... Stupid. Not quite the word I was looking for. Perhaps a little more off the top. Your lady awaits. Tale as old as time True as it can be Barely even friends Then somebody bends Unexpectedly Just a little change Small to say the least Both a little scared Neither one prepared Beauty and the Beast Ever just the same Ever a surprise Ever as before Ever just as sure As the sun will rise Oh Tale as old as time Tune as old as song Bittersweet and strange Finding you can change Learning you were wrong Certain as the sun Rising in the east Tale as old as time Song as old as rhyme Beauty and the Beast Tale as old as time Song as old as rhyme Beauty and the Beast Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip. -It's past your bedtime. Mm, mm Good night, love. Belle? Are you happy here with me? Yes. What is it? If only I could see my father again. Just for a moment. I miss him so much. There is a way. This mirror will show you anything. Anything you wish to see. I'd like to see my father, please. Papa! Oh, no. He's sick. He may be dying, and he's all alone. Then you... you must go to him. - What did you say? - I release you. You're no longer my prisoner. You mean... I'm free? Yes. Oh, thank you. Hold on, Papa, I'm on my way. Take it with you so you'll always have a way to look back and remember me. Thank you for understanding how much he needs me. Well, Your Highness, I must say everything is going just swimmingly. I knew you had it in you. -I let her go. Yes, yes. Splen... you what? - How could you do that? - I had to. Yes, but-but-but... but why? Because I love her. I was the one who had it all I was the master of my fate I never needed anybody in my life I learned the truth too late I'll never shake away the pain I close my eyes but she's still there I let her steal into my melancholy heart It's more than I can bear Now I know she'll never leave me Even as she runs away She will still torment me Calm me, hurt me Move me, come what may Wasting in my lonely tower Waiting by an open door I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in And be with me for evermore I rage against the trials of love I curse the fading of the light Though she's already flown So far beyond my reach She's never out of sight Now I know she'll never leave me Even as she fades from view She will still inspire me Be a part of everything I do Wasting in my lonely tower Waiting by an open door I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in And as the long, long nights begin I'll think of all that might have been Waiting here For evermore What defines the legacy of a story? Its enduring impact both on and off the screen for evermore. Perhaps it's seeing that story reinvented just as Beauty and the Beast was in its ground-breaking, highly-acclaimed Broadway adaptation. Since then, Disney Theatrical Productions under the direction of its president and producer, Thomas Schumacher, has forged a new chapter in the legacy of this classic title, one that gave audiences around the world a chance to fall in love with these iconic characters all over again, from India to Australia to the warm Footlights in the West End and throughout the UK. Or perhaps the legacy of this timeless classic is in witnessing the magical spark of inspiration it ignites in artists, in children who wish they could be part of its world, and in grown-ups who still dream of the same. As for where that legacy will go from here, only time will tell. But if you would care to make a prediction, please, be our guest. Hi! It's all right, Papa. I'm home. I thought I'd never see you again. I missed you so much. But the Beast... how did you escape? I didn't escape, Papa. He... he let me go. - That horrible Beast? - But he's different now, Papa. He's changed somehow. - Hi! - Oh, a stowaway. Why, hello there, little fella. Didn't think I'd see you again. Belle, why'd you go away? Don't you like us anymore? Oh, Chip, of course I do. -It's just that... - May I help you? - I've come to collect your father. - My father? - Don't worry, mademoiselle. -We'll take good care of him. - My father's not crazy. - He was raving like a lunatic. -We all heard him, didn't we? -No! - I won't let you. - Belle? Maurice. Tell us again, old man. Just how big was the Beast? He was... I mean, he was... he was enormous! I'd say at least 8... no, more like 10 feet. Well, you don't get much crazier than that. It's true, I tell you! -Get him out of here. Let go of me! No! You can't do this. Poor Belle. It's a shame about your father. You know he's not crazy, Gaston. Mm, I might be able to clear up this little misunderstanding, if... - If what? - If you marry me. - What? - One little word, Belle. That's all it takes. - Never. - Have it your way. Belle? Hey... Let go of me. My father's not crazy, and I can prove it. Show me the Beast! The Beast will make off with your children. He'll come after them in the night. - No! - Gaston is right! Look at its sharp, cruel fangs. It's threat to us all! We're not safe until its head is mounted on my wall. - I say we kill the Beast! - Yeah! No! I won't let you do this. The monster must have her under his spell. He'll curse us all if we don't stop him. - Yeah! - If you're not with us... -you're against us! Bring the old man. Get your hands off me! We can't have them running off to warn the creature. -Let us out! We'll rid the village of this Beast. Who's with me? Yeah! Through the mist Through the woods Through the darkness and the shadows It's a nightmare But it's one exciting ride Say a prayer then we're there At the drawbridge of a castle And there's something Truly terrible inside It's a beast He's got fangs, razor sharp ones Massive paws Killer claws for the feast Hear him roar, see him foam But we're not coming home Till he's dead -Good and dead -Yeah! -Kill the beast -Mount your horse Screw your courage To the sticking place We're counting on Gaston To lead the way Through the mist, through the wood Where within a haunted castle Something's lurking That you don't see every day It's a beast One as tall as a mountain We won't rest till he's good and deceased Sally forth, tally ho Grab your sword, grab your bow Praise the Lord and here we go We'll lay siege to the castle. We don't like What we don't understand In fact it scares us And this monster is mysterious at least Bring your guns, bring your knives Save your children and your wives We'll save our village and our lives We'll kill the beast Take whatever booty you can find. But remember, the Beast is mine! Hearts ablaze, banners high We go marching into battle Unafraid although The danger just increased Raise your flag, sing the song Here we come, we're 50 strong And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong Let's kill the beast -Now! Yes! Here we go! -What the devil? Belle, look out! You guys gotta try this thing. -Move, move, move, move. And stay out. Ugh. Get up. Get up! What's the matter, Beast? Too kind and gentle to fight back? BELLE: No! - Belle... - No, Gaston, don't! Let's go, Philippe. Come on out and fight. Were you in love with her, Beast? Did you honestly think she'd want you when she had someone like me? It's over, Beast. Belle is mine! Let me go. Let me go! Please, don't hurt me. I'll do anything. Anything! -Get out. Beast! Belle? Belle. You came back. Oh. You... - you came back. - Of course I came back. I couldn't let them... Oh, this is all my fault. - If only I'd gotten here sooner. - Maybe... it's better... it's better this way. Don't talk like that. -You'll be all right. We're together now. Everything's going to be fine. You'll see. At... at least... I got to see you one last time. No. No! Please, please. Please, don't leave me. I love you. Belle. It's me! It is you! Lumière. Cogsworth! Oh! Mrs. Potts! -Look at us! Mama, mama! -Oh, my goodness. -It is a miracle!
