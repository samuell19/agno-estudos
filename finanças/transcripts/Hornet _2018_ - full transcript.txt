- Local authorities are baffled at the large increase in disappearances in the last month. Investigators aren't sure if the missing persons are connected to numerous reports of strange lights in the sky. Seen here. But authorities are warning residents to remain in their homes-- Especially, after dark. At this time, reports of missing hikers, loved ones not returning home after hours, abandoned cars found at traffic lights, empty with the engine running are not currently linked to these occurrances, but many speculate that they are related. - [ no audio ] - Authorities have launched a countywide search in hopes of discovering any clues as to what may have happened. Nearby residents should remain vigilant and report any strange behavior. - It's been two days since the hiker, Matt Pruitt, shown here, went missing Friends say it was a routine hike for the self-proclaimed survivalist. And authorities maintain that Pruitt strayed off the trail and may still be lost in the woods. But one hiker, an eyewitness, believed that foul play might be involved. - It's not a claim. I saw it with my own two eyes. He is not lost. That thing took him! - Thing? - Yeah, a ship...in the sky. - Okay, well, thank you. I'm sure authorities are looking into it. - Look, I know you don't believe me, but I saw it! - Park rangers are encouraging... - Look, I saw it! - Hikers and campers to report anything that may lead to the recovery of... - This thing is out there! - What the hell is that? - See? I told you! That's what took Matt! - Well, what's it doing? - He's...oh, my...! - Run! - Hey, guys, here we are in the back shop of the robotics department. And we are gathering some supplies for a little weekend camping trip. I know what you guys are thinking. What do robotics and camping have to do with each other? Well, as some of you guys may know, Chloe, Luke and I have been working on something special. Hey, there's Chloe! Say hi, Chloe. - You're still doing this? - Tell them what you're working on. - I am writing the code for the new running sequence cycle patch. - Oh. - Yeah. - Yeah, I thought you did that two days ago. - I mean, I was working on it and I had to do the other sequences and it took a lot longer than I thought. - Okay. Um, just say something for the camera. Look presentable. We need this to work, okay? - Okay, yeah. - Thank you. Hi! This is Chloe! Say hi. - Hi! - These guys have been working around the clock to make this work. Isn't that right, Luke? - Yeah, sure have been. - You excited? - Actually, yeah. Part of the team, doing all the heavy lifting. Ready? - Yeah. - Chloe and I can do heavy lifting too. - Yeah? You sure you got that? - Yeah, I got it. You sure you got it? - Be careful, please. - Hey, guys, careful! You remember what happened last time. [ laughs ] - Watch the corner, watch the corner. - Yep, yep. Thank you. - Yep. - Watch the corner! - I see it, I see it! - I see the corner! - One, two, three.... - Don't...okay. - It's getting a lot heavier. - Yep. - Well, he's a big guy. - Any other updates for the camera? - Uh, yeah, updates. We, um... We fixed his joints. He's moving a lot smoother now. - And he's no longer top-heavy. His weight is now equally distributed to him. - Yeah. - Good. Hopefully, that new balance patch works this time. - Yes. Oh, and Professor Haley, if you're watching this, don't get mad. We had to borrow some things from the department. Don't get mad. - Borrow. - We'll bring it back safe and sound. - We promise! - Promise. - Promise. - All right, you guys, cross your fingers for us! Bye! - Professor Haley's on the phone, guys! - All right, guys, lock up tonight! - Hello? Hello? Why am I here? Where's Helen? Where's Chloe? Tell me what I'm doing here! - Sit down. We will begin momentarily. - Guys, I'm sorry, okay? - Here we are getting gas because Luke didn't look at the itinerary I sent out to him. - I looked at it. I just had so many things, I forgot, okay? - We had so many things to do too, Luke. What did you think we were doing? - Honest mistake. - We can't get too... - All right, we're here. We're here now. - We're off schedule anyways. - All right. - Yep, yep, yep. - Do you wait or do you do it yourself? What's happening? I mean, I don't see any credit card slot. - I don't know. Hello? - It's really old-timey. - Do you need to go get them. - Is this a working gas station? - Yeah, sure. - It looks antique. You guys seeing this? This door? - It might just be the wind. Very vintage. - Helen, stay. I'll check it out, all right? - Is there anyone in there? - Hold on. - Are you sure? - Hello? That's weird. - Where is everyone? - Feel like I haven't seen like a car on the road either. - Yeah, it's a little creepy. - Yeah, I don't know. Um... - Like a ghost town, I guess. - Yeah, I guess we'll get gas on the way back. - Do we have enough? - Yeah. I think we'll be fine. - You think? - What are you looking at? - Do you see something? - Do you see that? - No. What...well, like a coyote? - What'd you see? - Maybe. I don't know. Just get back in the truck. We'll be fine. Great. - We can make it? - Yeah. - All right. Well, let's just go in, get it on the way back. [ sighs ] - All right. Chloe, did you see that, though? - What? - No, I didn't see... he said he saw something. I don't know. - All right, well, guys, this is exciting. Let's go. Let's just go. - Yeah, those... - Let's just start what we started. - Fun little ghost town adventure. - All right. - Let's keep moving. - All right. And you're recording. - Awesome. - Let's see yours. Is that on too tight? - No. - Good. - Yeah. - How does that feel? - Nice. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Cool. - Yep. [ inaudible ] - Good. We need to get every angle. I don't want anyone doubting what's about to happen. - This is mot a magic trick. - Let's get eyes on us. - Okay, drone online. - Roll call? Chloe? - Here. - Luke? - Here. - Me? I am here rolling on both cams. Hello. It's October 13th and I'm Helen Martin joined by my colleagues, Luke Sullivan... - Here. - And Chloe Coyle. These following video logs will serve as documentation for Project Hornet. What my team is unveiling here the first time on camera is nine months of our blood, sweat and hard work advancing what you see before you. Let me introduce you to Hornet. Are you standing up? He stood up. Hornet was built to be a Crisis Relief Emergency Aide Teammate. But CREAT is such a boring acronym, so we just affectionately call him Hornet. I mean, just look at his paint job. It wasn't intentional, I can assure you. We needed him to stand out. Say hi, Hornet. - Hello. - We'll be using these video logs as Hornet's beta tests. We scouted this location for the utmost privacy and durability. And for the next 24 hours, we'll be onsite with Hornet making history. - He's looking sharp, really sharp. - Uh-huh. Yep. - Not bad, Chloe, not bad. - Well, thank you. - Hey, we're a team here. - You did all right, Luke. You did all right. - All right. All right, I'll take it. - Well, you know, he hasn't done anything yet, so. - Okay. What are we waiting for? Let's do it. - I know. - Yeah. - Yay! - I need to know that my friends are okay! - Mr. Luke Sullivan? We believe that you and your associates were witness to an extraordinary event. - I'd say, but I ain't gonna tell you anything until I know where my friends are. - Mr. Sullivan, we have concerns that you and your friends might be a threat to national security. - We're the threat? Are you kidding me? No! No, not a chance! I ain't telling you shit, okay, until I see my friends. Where's Helen? Where's Chloe? If I don't see them, I ain't telling you another word. [ shouts ] It started with an experiment. My friends and I, we built a robot, a fully functioning assistant machine. And then we took it out into the field for its first field test. - Almost ready? - Yep, yep. Almost got it. - Hey, Chloe, can I get a snack bar? - Can't come over here yourself? 'Cause I'm not like busy at all? - Hey, careful. - All right. - Nice. - Now we'll see what you see, buddy. - Ready, buddy? Begin. - Oh, Robo can jump. - Woo! - Wow. Look at that! - Big jump! - Oh, someone's excited! Okay. - Told you loosening his joints was great. - No, you were right. You're right. Okay, all right. - Are we ready? - Yeah. He is set. - Hornet, initiate rescue protocol! - Oh, my gosh! - He's going so fast! - Are you kidding me? - 50 miles per hour! - I hope he doesn't eat it. - Approaching GPS position. - I got it, easy. Come on! - Oh, my gosh. - This is his first day. Don't push it too hard. - He's all right! He's all right. He's all right! - Ah, but I can't see him anymore. Okay, he's out of frame. Uh, what do we do? - Let's go get him. Come on. - Back? - Let's get him. - Get him? Get him? - What? Should we go? Okay, okay, okay, okay, I'm coming! - He's going too far! Hornet? - He's having fun. - Hornet! Wait up! Stop! - All right, test three, take one. - Hornet, hurry! Someone's about to fall out of the tree! - Come on, buddy, come on, buddy, come on. - Come on, come on. - Hurry up! He's about to fall out! - Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go. - Come on! Hurry! - Hurry up! He's about to fall out! Come on! - Look at him! He's scaling the tree! - Oh! - Did you see that? - I know! - I got that! I got it! - Did you get that? Please tell me you got caught it. - I caught it. [ shouting ] - He flew! [ overlapping dialogue ] - If you're seeing this, with a bit more funding and some tweaks, Hornet can absolutely take full flight! - Oh, my God! - Excellent job, everybody! Especially you, big guy! - He grabbed it right out of the air! It was amazing. - His interface is so much more complex than we realized. The implications for artificial intelligence alone! - Look, guys, all in, all in, all in! - We built that! - It actually works! - I know. - Danger! - Yes, buddy, you detected danger and you inferred a crisis all on your own! - No, no, no, no, no. Scanners indicate individuals approaching. - What? - Yeah, like... - I thought you said it was deep enough in the woods. We'd be clear. - I thought it was. I... - Shh. - Where? Where? Hornet, where? - Let's move. Let's go. - We gotta hide him, right? - Yeah, we gotta hide him. Come on, Hornet. - The trees are dense over there. Hide Hornet. - On it. - Hornet, come with me. - Affirmative. - Shh! Shh! Come on! - No respect for nature. - Pull the drone in. - Shh, shh. Pull the lights. - Hi. - Does this belong to you? - Yeah. Is there an issue, officer? - This portion of the forest is restricted to camping. You're not supposed to be here. What are y'all doing here? - Uh, we...uh... - Bathroom break. Long hike. - He has the worst bladder! - Yeah, just flows right through me. - Yep. - All right, you three are going... now. - He has the worst bladder. - Worst ever! Bladder like a baby! - Worst, yep, yep. - Hornet! - All right. Three of you guys need to leave. - Leave? We're not camping. We're just passing through. - Yeah. - I need you three to leave right now. - Hornet! What are you doing? Move. - But... - Hey, I'm sick and tired of the level of disrespect for the forest. - Hornet, sit down. - It's not your personal party playground where you can just come and do drugs or whatever's up your sleeve. - We're not doing drugs. - Sir, we don't do drugs. - What did I say? - Graham are you there? - Graham here. We have a situation in Quadrant Four. Can you get down over here? Graham? Anybody? Graham! [ groans ] - Dispatch! - [ mouths words ] - Dispatch? - [ flies buzzing ] - [ mouths words ] - All right, I gotta go, and so do you. - Okay. - We will pack up our things and leave ASAP. You have my word. - Mm-hmm. - No. Nope, you guys are gonna do it right now. - Okay, but what about our things? What about the "leave only footprints" adage? As a ranger, you must agree. - You should've thought about that before you pissed me off. Now you kids have already broken the rules once. I can't trust that you won't break them again. I'm gonna get somebody to clean this up. We'll pack up your belongings and then you guys can come by later and pick it up. - That doesn't make any sense. We can just pick our stuff up now. - No. Either you do it the way I told you to do it, or I'm gonna arrest you guys, all three. - What? - Do you even have that authority, Ranger? What's your badge number? - Whoa, Helen, Helen, Helen... - Okay! Okay, okay! - Luke, keys? I'm driving! - Coming. Thanks. I almost finished. Just gonna grab my jacket. - We're not even camping. - I know. - Keys? - He's stuck back there. - I know. - He's gonna find him. - I know. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. - All right, well, let's make it look like we're leaving. Here, go on out there. - It's a nice fairy tale, a couple of college kids build a robot, take it to the forest, have some fun. But, you see, I'm skeptical of this whole thing. - What are you talking about? That's how it was. - So, Mr. Sullivan, you graduated from high school with a 2.0 average. Now someone like you is at university building robots? - I was good at auto workshop. - Uh-huh. - Okay? - Well, fixing a car is a far cry from robotic technology. There are sensors, software to worry about, not to mention flight. - Yeah, I know. I leave the smart stuff up to Helen and Chloe. They do the programming. I build the gadgets. Shit, I'm an engineering pro. I don't need school to tell me that. - But you got this thing to fly? - So what? Anything can fly as long as you can stabilize it. Drones fly. Bet you have some of those. - Fascinating. - What's your problem? - My problem? - Yeah. - My problem... - Look, you can interrogate me and you ask me about Hornet? You don't give a shit. I'm not gonna say another word to you until I know where my friends are. - See, you don't get to make demands here. Frankly, you're at my mercy. - No. Screw that. - Well, you are screwed, Mr. Sullivan. You act all tough, but underneath all this, you're just a scared little child. You see, I now your type. You are the goofball. You are supposedly strong or at least you play that way. You're sincere mostly, but underneath all that bravado, you're just a little insect. - Would you quit with the psychoanalysis shit? You're hurting my head. - I don't need to analyze you. You see, I know you. You're the resident goofball, the guy who wants the girl. You're the guy who can't protect the girl. - What are you talking about? [ chuckles ] - See how uncomplicated you are? - You talking about Chloe? Is she okay? - I don't know what you're talking about. - I could kill you! - One of us may not be leaving this room. I don't think I'd bet on me, though. - Okay, if I answer your stupid questions, will you let me see my friends? - We'll see. - What else do you want to know? - This, uh, robot, how did you get the funding? - The professor got the money, figured it was some research grants or something. - So how much did this robot cost to build? - I don't know. I didn't worry about the money. I just got the parts. - So who was responsible for handling these resources? - I don't know. Helen maybe? Look, I'm just a gearhead. You point at something, I'll build it. - How long did this Hornet take to construct? - A few months. I mean, we had most of the parts. We built a few, printed out some more. - Hmm. It seems like a short gestation period for such a complicated thing. - I guess. - And you never thought this was weird or strange in any way? - Weird like how? - Well, I mean, you and your friends built this surprisingly sophisticated technical piece of machinery and you had very little resources. And this didn't strike you as odd in any way? - What do I know? I'm just a stupid goofball, remember? - Luke... Look, Luke, I think you're holding out on me. - What do you want me to say? You don't believe me? - So tell me what happened after? - After the Ranger? - Yes. After the Ranger showed up. - I mean, we hopped back in the car and then shit got really weird. If you didn't believe me before, you're not gonna believe me now. - Try me. - Don't say I didn't warn you. - Look, we just can't just keep our stuff there. - And we're not, but we gotta leave for now or we risk arrest or worse. - We risk Hornet. I agree. Hornet's not ready to be exposed to the world! We could get him taken away! - Okay, so we just leave a piece of expensive, irreplaceable high-tech machinery to be exposed to the elements! - He's a 10-foot tall robot. I think that he can manage. - Look, guys, we're just gonna make it look like we left. And as soon as we're sure as we're sure the coast is clear, we'll double back and we'll grab Hornet. We'll get outta here! - What about that Ranger? - You heard him! He has other stuff to deal with! - Hey! - Oh, my God! - Oh, my... - What? Why is he just standing there? - Sir, I am so sorry! - Did you hit him? Are you okay? - Are you okay? - Helen, careful. - My God, is he holding a hatchet? Don't get too close! Guys... - Are you all right? - Sir, are you okay? - Guys! - Can you hear us? - Be careful! - Sir, can you hear us? Are you lost? Do you need help? - Guys, he has a hatchet. - Do you need us to get you some help? - Guys, get in the truck. Helen, Luke, I think we should get in the truck. - Yeah, listen. Helen, back in the car. - We're gonna get you help. - Helen. Please? Please? - What the hell? - Did you see this? - What is his deal? - Wait. What? - He's got this black stuff coming right out of his mouth. He didn't even look... - What? - I think he's sick. I think we need to help him. - I don't know. - No. I don't think... he didn't even respond to us. - Oh, my God. - We don't even...what? What? - Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke... - Oh, shit. Oh, my God. That's it! That's it! - Who is that? What is that? - What do you want? He's just staring at me, guys! - This is a joke! This is a... - What is he doing? What is he doing? - What is he doing? What is he doing? - Is this a joke? - Get away! This isn't funny, okay? - He's leaving. - Is that blood? - What? - Okay, okay, okay, okay. - Guys, he has a hatchet! - Helen, put it-- Oh, shit! Oh, my God, there's more of them! There's more of them! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - What the hell is that? - What is that? - Helen, get that! Oh, my God! - What is happening? - Guys, he's not here anymore. - They're just staring at us! - Oh, my God, what is happening? - Guys, he's not here anymore. [ screaming ] - He's on the roof! He's on the roof! What is that? What is it? - What's on the roof? Is it one of them? [ screams ] - What do you want? - Go away! - What do you want from us? - Go away! [ screaming ] - Go, go, go, go! Run, run, run, run! [ screaming ] - What do they want? What do you want from us? - Is this a joke? It's not funny! - What do you want from us? - What are they doing? What are they doing? - I don't know, but that's the truck! We can't just leave it! - This is... This is not funny! - Oh, my God! - They're just staring at... oh, shit! - Oh, my God! - They're coming! God! Helen, come on! - Go, go, go, go! - Come on! Come on! In here! - Go, go! - Oh, my God! What in the world was that? - What was that? - I don't know, I don't know. - Did you see them up there? - Yes, we all saw them. - Oh, my God. [ gasping ] What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? - I don't know. [ crying ] - What happened to the truck? Did they take it? - Okay, okay, we need to talk. We need to think. Just breathe, okay? Just breathe. - Hornet! - We don't have Hornet. We need to think of something. - Hornet was not at camp when we went to go get him, which means that's he's lost in the mountains. Where could he be? Where could he be? Did they... - Did they what? I don't know, I don't know. I think we lost them. - Can we stay here for a little bit? - Did you see their faces? They're all messed up! Something is going on, an epidemic or something. [ clattering ] - What was that? [ clattering ] - Is that them? - It's gotta be, it's gotta be. Grab something! Grab something! - Grab something? What... - Take this. They're coming, they're coming. [ knocking on door ] - Knock, knock, Helen Martin. - Oh, my gosh. Are you kidding me, Hornet? - Hornet! Thank God! - Really? Get in here, asshole. - You scared us half to death! - Faster, faster! Luke, close the door! - Sit down. - Hornet found makers. - Yes! Get in! - Close the doors! Close the doors! - I did not program you to be this stupid! - Hornet? Really? Where were you? We put you in one spot and told you to stay right there! - We needed your help! Why didn't you help us? - Why did you not stay where I put you? - Did you see anything? Did you see anything? - Maybe we could use his recordings? - Check his recordings! - Yeah. - GPS? [ creaking ] - What is that? - It's the same thing from the car. - Does that mean they're coming? What are we doing? - I don't know, I don't know. - Grab the camera, Helen, grab the camera. Bring it here. Come on, hurry. - Oh, my God. - What is that? - Something is going on. Something awful. We need to get out of here now. - That's an alien... that's an alien ship! - No, it's not, okay? Get your head on your shoulders, Chloe. It's not aliens. It can't be! It's gonna to be... I don't know, military... - It's not military technology. Never seen anything like that! - Me neither, but I don't know, okay? It's not aliens! - There has to be a rational explanation, you know. Maybe not military testing, but, I don't know. - Okay, who cares? - Bioweapons? I don't know! - Danger! - Yeah, no shit! - Hornet, can your sensors tell when there's individuals approaching? - Lifeforms are approaching 100 feet and closing. 90. - Shh! - Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! - What do we do? - I don't know, I don't know. [ gasps ] - Shh. - Oh, God. - Oh my God. - Shh! - What are they doing? What are they doing? What are they doing? - Oh, God. - Can they see us? - I don't know. - Can they... Can... [ sneezes ] - Shh! - Sorry, I'm sorry. [ crying ] - Oh, my God. - Shh! - Can they see me? - He's looking right at us! They've stopped. Can they see us? - Oh, my God, are they looking at us? [ crying ] - They stopped. - They're leaving. They're leaving. - Lifeforms dispersed. - Come on, buddy! Put a sock in it, all right? We're scared to death here! [ clattering ] - What is that? - They're back! - Hornet, what is that? It's just one. - What do we do? - It's just one. I don't even care! We gotta do something! - Luke, no! - What the hell? - Get in here! Hurry, hurry, hurry! - You? You're still here? I thought I told you guys to get outta here! - Hornet, where were you on that, huh? Why didn't you tell us it was him? - You told me to put a sock in it. - Look, I'm sorry, okay? Those people out there, they... - And they attacked you. I know. Look, something crazy is going on out there, okay? Dozens of townspeople, they just coming up missing. Then they're coming back crazy. Look, they killed one of the other rangers and they destroyed my vehicle. - Oh, my God. - The mountain isn't safe. We got to get to a secure location and call for help. - Okay. - I agree. To preserve life, we must get out of here and tell the world of this phenomenon. - What is that? - What? You've never seen an Emergency Services Bot before? You know the way out? - Yeah. Follow me. - Take this. - Thank you. - Hornet, come on! - Hornet, come on! - Let's move, Hornet! - You know how all this sounds? - I'd say crazy, and it was. It was seriously crazy. But you guys would know that, wouldn't you? UFOs and aliens and all that? - Do we? - Yeah. That's not half the secret that you thought it was. Come on, we know and we know that you know. - So what about those that were attacking you? What about them? - I don't know. It was all really confusing. Look, we didn't hurt anyone that wasn't trying to hurt us first. - I'm not accusing you of hurting anyone, yet. - There you go again with your veiled threats. - No. When I threaten you, you'll know it. - Harsh. You're so harsh. - I am what I need to be in a world filled with the poor and the useless, the uncooperative. - I'm cooperating right now, aren't I? - Supposedly. - Let me ask you a question. - That's not how it works, Lukey. - I want to know how something like that could happen to us and we got no help at all. I mean, shit, afterwards you just locked me up here! I'd always hoped that the government were the good guys. That's not the picture that I'm getting right now. - You want assurances that we're on your side? - I just want to know that there's still good in this world, yeah. And that you're not gonna kill me when this is over. - You keep looking for safety! You say you saw alien ships and you were attacked by warped civilians! You know, if I were you, I would be scared shitless right now! I'd be peeing down my pants! I'd be so worried about what was coming, I wouldn't know what to do! I would be so scared! - I'm good. I'm all right. Really. I'm good. [ chuckles ] - You know... There's one thing I have learned in life. You're never really good. You're alive only because you're breathing. And the world is always trying to crush you between each breath. - Mm-mm. I think you're wrong. - I think I would have to remind you of how right I am. Just let me know when you're ready. - No! [ screams ] - Hornet, don't go too far. - Did you see that? Did you see that? - Yeah. - The light. - Yeah, we been seeing them all over the mountain. We have no idea where they're coming from or what's causing them. - I'm telling you, it's that ship! It's alien! - Chloe, come on. It's not plausible! - Yes, it is! How do you explain the hordes of crazy people? There's got to be a controlling influence! - It could be... - Some drugs like PCP...? - Yeah. - No. - Can alter the neurons in your brain making you irrational. - It's not PCP, Helen. - It's not aliens, Chloe. - That ship could be foreign and those could be a new form of terrorists? - Okay, well, how do you explain the light that sucks people up? There's no tech on earth that can do that! - Speaking at technology, you guys have... - Helen, look out! Look out! [ screaming ] - Luke! Luke! - Helen! [ screaming, shouting ] - Luke! Luke! Helen! - Hey, you guys run! - Helen! Luke! Luke! Go! Luke, get up! Get up! - Come on! Get up! - Get the fuck out of my way! Crazy bitches! - Wait, the ranger! Is he okay? Is he okay? - Hornet, what the hell was that? - What the fuck is going on? - We can't just leave him! - He was buying us time, come on! - He's the only one that knows the way out! - Hornet was built for crisis aid and rescue. I think he can manage. Lead the way, Hornet. - Hornet can't! Are you kidding me? What's he gonna do? Look, that park ranger is probably dead. And him? He just stood there! - He's shown adaptive skills, but this is not something that we programmed into him! - Guys, be quiet! - Helen, this isn't a field test anymore! - Quiet! - Those things are still human and technically he cannot still hurt humans, okay? - If we want a fighting chance, I think we have to reprogram Hornet's code parameters, okay? - Can we do that? - Let's do that, yes. - Okay. Find a spot to set you down. - Shit. Thanks. - Thank you for waiting, Miss Martin. - What was that noise? You guys torturing people? - What if I said yes? - What kind of people are you? - We're the good guys. - No. I'm not saying anything until I speak to my lawyer. - Well, that won't be possible. - I'm not saying another word until I speak to my lawyer. [ chuckles ] - You people and your lawyers. Let's say we're in a magic land where lawyers don't exist. - You act like this is some kind of game. - Well, if it were, we're in a new round. You see, we can't torture him forever or he'll die on us. So we give him a few minutes before we start again. - You're sick. - Yeah, people have said that sometimes, but I really don't see what it means. I serve a function, Miss Martin. You do understand that, right? I mean, you're a tech genius. You build machines that serve functions. So in effect, that's your own function. - I'm not a robot. I have a family. I have friends. I'm not some code in a program. I have people who love me, who will come looking for me. - Well, they won't find you unless I want them to find you. I'm wondering why you haven't asked me what my function is. - I don't care. I just want my friends and I want to go home. - My function, Miss Martin... is to take every bit of information from you, your friends, the professor and this robot of yours, this Hornet. And dissect the links between you and the events that happened on the mountain. - And what do you know about what happened on the mountain? - I know you're a lot more responsible than you're willing to admit. - What's that supposed to mean? - Let's just say we're both on a journey of discovery, Miss Martin. But your price may be a heavy one to pay. [ screaming ] Does that voice sound familiar? - No, you wouldn't... Luke? - Yes, that is him. He's told me some of the story. But why don't you bring me up to speed? If you cooperate, I could stop this procedure. So do we have a deal? - Yes, we have a deal. Please, will you stop hurting him? - Yes. Hold. So, why don't you pick it up from where he left off? - Where was that exactly? - Hornet afraid. - Really assuring. You're afraid? Can it even do that? - I guess so. - It's okay, buddy. Okay, you're both connected. - All right, almost got it. - Whatever you're doing, hurry up. I'm starting to hear things. - Yeah, I'm going as fast as I can, okay? - Okay. - Got it? - Almost got it, almost got it, almost got it. - Come on! - I got it, I got it! - Are you sure? - Yeah. - You sure it's gonna work? - No. - Hornet, what's your primary directive? - Chloe, look out! - Ah! [ screaming ] - [ indistinct ] - [ screaming ] - Protect makers. - It worked! - I guess so! - Hornet, that was awesome! - Oh, my God! - Perfect. - I don't know. Let's get outta here. - Yeah. - Oh, my gosh! Tell me we got that! That was incredible! Guys? - Where'd they go? - Oh, my God. - Where'd they go? - I don't know. That means they'll probably be back, won't they? - Yeah, most definitely. - Then we'll be ready. - Yeah. - Oh, yeah. We gotta get outta here. - You guys sure this is still a good idea? - Probably not. - God, I hope so. - Hey! A bunch of fresh idiots! Come on! Come and get us! - What are they doing? - I don't know. - They're just standing there. - They're just standing there. - Why are they just standing there? What are they gonna do? Luke, look out! - Get them off of me! - Chloe! Hey, get off! Get off! - Camera, camera. - Come on! Come on, come on! Hornet, come on! - Come on, Hornet! - We gotta go! We gotta go! We gotta go! - Go, go, go! - Luke? Luke, wake up. - Hmm? - Now you have a pretty high tolerance for a civilian. - Tolerance? - Torture. You could make a good agent someday. - That's not my bag. How can you just sit there and do this to me? - It's my job. It's what I have to do. - Come on. A little help, please? Please? - You think I'm cruel? - Is that a trick question? - I can be your best friend or your worst nightmare. The choice is yours. - What you want from me? - How long have we been running? Will Hornet be able to find us? - He'll catch up with us. - Why won't those things just stay down? - Keep moving! [ screams ] - Ranger? - You're alive? - For now, but it hasn't been easy. Look, the hills are crawling with these things! - We can't talk. If you can walk, we need to keep moving. - Come on. Here, here. Come on, let's go. Come on. What are you doing? Come on! We gotta go! - What are you doing? - Must protect makers. - What do you want? - To play! - Must protect... - What is that? - What are you doing to him? - Protect... - Let him go, you bastard! - ...tect-- protect-- - Get away - Hornet! Are you okay, Hornet? You okay, buddy? - Now! Time to run! - Hornet, what's your primary objective? - No, Hornet! - Helen! - Stop! - No, Chloe! - Chloe! [ screaming ] - Hornet, over here! - Get up! Come on. We gotta go! [ grunts ] - Come on, we gotta go! We gotta go! Keep moving! - Go! - We're trying. - I can't breathe. - Chloe, careful. Hold on! - Get down, get down! - Get down. - Shh. Shh... - Oh, God. Did we lose him? - I think so. For now. - Oh, we gotta keep going. - Come on, guys. We gotta keep moving. - Hold on. One, two... [ grunts ] - Chloe, come on. You can do it, girl. Come on. - No, I can't! - Chloe! - He was pulled up by those lights. He'll be back, yes. Yes, I'm serious. - What's wrong with him? Why'd he attack us? [ coughing ] - Those lights. I think they're doing something to him, maybe reprogramming him. - Spit it out. - I want to know about Hornet's origins. - Origin? - Yes. Who designed him? Who planned him? - I told you. The professor planned, maybe Helen helped. I just built him. - I believe you're feigning ignorance. - I'm gonna be honest with you. You're one crazy son of a bitch. I have no idea what's going on inside of that crazy-ass head of yours. - You can insult me all you want, but it won't get you Helen and it won't get you Chloe. - That's if they're even alive, right? - What if they are? - Then you better not be hurting them like you're hurting me. Because if you are, I'll kill you. Mark my words. - You want one shot at seeing them again, tell me where Hornet came from. - I told you. We just built him. - Not all of him. Tech like that can't be developed by three college kids and an absentminded professor. No, no, no. Some of those parts you didn't build yourself! They must have been alien. - Aliens? - Yes, non-human origin? - Aliens don't exist. - Well, then what about this wild story you've been telling me? - How do I know this isn't yours? Some government aircraft, huh? - Well, if they did exist, they're not ours. - How can I be sure? You've been messing with me since I got in here. They could be Russian, Chinese... - Maybe we could solve this if you just told me where Hornet's parts came from. - Hornet's parts? - Yes. - Okay. You're right. I been holding back this whole time. I think it's time I told you. You ready? - Yes. - Okay. Yeah, they... they came in these... these huge cardboard boxes. It was crazy. They were U.S. postage stamped, FedEx delivered, mindblown. - You think you're funny? [ chuckles ] - Yeah. And I've been telling you the truth this whole time. [ coughing ] - Hey, hey, how you doing? [ crying ] - It's okay, it's okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Oh, my goodness. It's okay. Oh, my God. I think you broke some ribs. Okay, breathe, breathe, breathe. What about you? - Ow, God, come on! I think it's dislocated. Come on. - Stop it. You're not much use to me with a gimpy arm. - Oh! Helen, I hate you. - I know. It's okay. - Oh, my gosh. - You're okay, you're okay. Breathe, breathe. - Breathe. - Breathe. [ groans ] - I hate camping. [ laughs ] - We're okay, we're okay. - You remember when coming into the woods was a great idea? - We should never leave the lab. - But we... But we... - We stole all of our Professor's stuff. - He's gonna be pissed. He's gonna be so mad. Breathe. We're okay. - You think we could stay here for the night? - We don't really have a choice. We have no choice. - Think we'll die here? - Mm-hmm. - I don't know. - I don't believe in aliens or government conspiracies! All I know is what I saw on that mountain. - All right, let's talk about that. What happened after you reprogrammed Hornet to defend you against those Sleepers? - I didn't tell you that. Chloe? Helen? Did they tell you? - Maybe. Tell me more and maybe you'll be reunited. - Maybe? - Well, nothing's guaranteed. - I fucking hate you. [ chuckles ] - Well, then I am doing my job. So what happened next? [ coughing ] - How does it feel? - How does it look? Ah! - Like hell? - There you go. - I don't know who's gonna see this recording or if anyone's gonna see this. But... It's the job of a scientist to document. And in these extreme conditions, it's what I know to do. Hornet has gone rogue, reprogrammed by whatever force is behind the attacks in the woods. And... While running away from our creation, we got lost deeper into the woods. And without Hornet's advanced technology, we're lost. Chloe is hurt bad and now... we just need to make it down out of the mountain safely. Honestly, that was the goal the whole time. I was just too stubborn to listen. - Helen, you can't think that way. - No, Chloe, it was my idea to push the experiment, to push you. I'm selfish. - You wanted to change the world. That's not selfish. - Yeah, okay? It's not on you. It's on all of us. We built Hornet together, we came out here together. And we believed in this project. - Still believe. - Still believe. - Still believe. Yet, we couldn't even stop him from getting into the wrong hands. - Aliens. What are you gonna do? - Keep thinking about that Ranger's face. He's one of them. At this rate, it could spread everywhere. - Yeah, but we're not gonna let that happen, robot or no. [ coughing ] - I don't know if you guys have noticed, but I'm not really in a particular condition for quick escape right now. And the chances of survival at night are slim. - Yeah. I don't like knowing the odds, okay? - It's more like statistics, so figured you'd want to know. I figured, as a scientist, you'd appreciate that. [ coughing ] Just give me a minute. [ coughing ] - Yeah, sure. How long? - How long what? - You know what I'm talking about. [ sighs ] - Not long. We can get her through the next few hours, but we need to get her some medical help. - So you lost your prize toy. That must have been hard. - I didn't even care about that. Chloe was hurt, maybe dying. Is she dead? - You keep asking about her. Is there some kind of special affection... - Just answer the damn question! Is she dead or not? - No, I can see that this is important to you, but we're not through here yet. - What does that have to do with anything? - Look, you never thought it strange that Hornet could be reprogrammed so easily? - So now you believe me? - Let's say, yes, I believe you. But did it ever occur to you that these flying ships could reprogram your precious friend? - Yeah, sure. It was strange. A lot of strange things happened that day. Call it a cherry on top of the shit sundae. Look, our robot got hijacked and we were screwed. - And it never made you question the origins of your robot companion? - Why would it? - Come on, Luke. You must have known that something was off. I mean, that your friends weren't telling you everything. You're not that stupid! - What are you talking about? - Bring in the girl. - The girl? Chloe? Helen? What are you doing to her? Don't you put a hand on her! Chloe! - So, Miss Martin, what didn't you tell Luke? - What didn't I tell him? - About the tests. About Hornet? What did you keep from Luke that almost cost him his life? - Luke, don't listen to him. - Now you'll hear all the way she played you for a fool. - We gotta go...now. - All right. Well, let's move. - You guys know I can hear you, right? - Chloe, I'm sorry. We didn't mean for you to... - Pretty good with facts and figures, so... - Look, Chloe, we're gonna do everything that we can to get you out of here, okay? - Well, you better. I want to see the look on the professor's face when you tell him about the frickin' robot. - Yeah, we did... [ coughing ] What if they come back, huh? We don't have Hornet with us this time to warn us. - Honestly, it's Hornet that I'm the most worried about. - I mean, you guys just have to leave me. - What? - What? - No way! - Don't be stupid. - I wouldn't want to slow you down. - You're not gonna slow us down, Chloe. - Chloe... - It was your project anyway. - No, it's our project. - Your research, it's much more important that you get back and tell everybody what's happened. - Stop it, Chloe! I need you. I may push you, but I am nothing without you, okay? We're not going anywhere. - Always have to have it your way, huh? - Yeah. [ chuckles ] It's gonna be a long night. - Yeah, guys, and... I'm sorry to say this, but I think we should power down. Save our battery overnight? - Yeah, I know. You're right. - You okay? - Mm-hmm. - Here. - I'm Helen Martin once again signing off. Wish us luck. - I think I saw him flying, guys. I can't believe it. - He's not gonna give up. - Come on. We gotta keep moving. - We keep hearing things. I think they're out... - Shit! It's him! Helen, take Chloe now! Take her! Go! Run! Run! He's right on top of us! Keep going! - Where is that? - Get it up for me! - Move, move, move, move! He's coming! - I don't know where this goes! - I don't care! Do you wanna switch? - Run! - He's gaining on me! [ screaming ] He's gaining! - [ Hornet growls ] - Hornet, what? [ inaudible ] [ Hornet growls ] - He's gaining on me! - I don't know where to go! - Move, move, move! Guys, come on! Keep moving! Keep going! Oh, shit! Come on, keep going, keep going! Hey, come on, guys! He's gaining. Move, move, move, move, move! [ yelling ] - It hurts. - Let's go. Guys? Guys? He's stuck! We got him! We got you, you bastard! Whoa! - Why are you doing this, Hornet? - Look what you're doing to us! - It's us. - Eliminate biological infestation. Eradicate all targets. Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! - He's not listening, okay? - We gotta leave. - Eradicate all targets. Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! - Keep moving, keep moving. - Eliminate biological infestation. Come on, Chloe, come on. We'll find somewhere to sit down, okay? Come on. Luke, come on, come on. - How long is this cave? - Over here, over here. Sit down, sit down. Chloe, come on. I think we're clear. - Yeah, for now. - For how long? - You guys should know the answer to that. You built him. - We built him. - Right. - All right, guys. Any thoughts, theories? We got to think of something now that we've this robot from hell chasing us. - Really playing scientist students right now. - Come on, Chloe, it's what we do best, right? - Right. - Well, we gotta do something. - All right. Well, what have we got? - I don't know. This one is beyond me. [ coughing ] - Guys, you feel that? - What? - It's wind, it's wind. It's coming from over there. Guys, I feel it. It's coming from over there. - Good job. - All right, there's got to be a way out. Come on. - Okay. - Look, I'm sorry, Chloe, but we gotta keep moving. Here. Get up. Come on. Here. Come on. I'm sorry. Ready? One, two, three... [ grunts ] - Come on, come on. Helen? You keep a look out for Hornet. Let's keep moving. - I'm looking. I think we lost him. - Okay. [ shouting ] - No! No! The light! - Come on, Chloe! [ Hornet growling ] Come on, come on! Guys, come on! [ screaming ] It's caving in! Come on, guys! He's gaining. - Run! It's caving in. Go on! - Keep moving, keep moving, keep moving. Come on, Chloe! Come on! Helen? [ screams ] It's getting smaller! It's caving in! - Chloe! Go! - Chloe, come on! Come on! Come on, go, Chloe! [ screaming ] - Come on, go! Chloe, go! - Chloe, go! Come on! Here, grab my hand! It's caving in! Come on, come on! - Pull her! Pull her! [ shouting, screaming ] He's got her! Come on, we gotta go. Chloe, we gotta leave! - Can't leave her! - We gotta leave! We can't help her! Come on! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Helen? Chloe, she's gone. We gotta go! Come on, Chloe! - No, she's not! Helen! - Chloe, come on! We gotta go. Come on! - I know she's in there. - Chloe, she's-- - Helen! Helen! - I think she's-- - No! [ screams ] - Helen! Helen! - He took her, he took her. - At least she's alive, okay? At least she's alive. - Why did he they want her? - I don't know, I don't know. [ panting ] Chloe, Chloe, calm down, calm down. Breathe, okay? Breathe. Look at me, look at me. Breathe. Good. Good, like that. How do you feel? - Please help me find her. Please? - Okay. - Please? - I will, okay? We will. We'll find her. - Okay. - Here. Come on, come on. - Other side. - Other side? Here, come on. [ crying ] Here, hold on. Take it easy. Keep breathing. - We're there! - Chloe, you gotta be careful. - We have to find Helen, okay? - Look, making your injuries worse won't help her! - Don't lecture me! - Chloe, I can't lose you, too, okay? I can't. - What do you mean? - I mean, I care about you. - I care about you, too. - Look, we'll find Helen. Look at me. I promise, okay? You're hurt. Let's just rest. - I'm scared. - I know, I know, I know. I'm sorry. We'll get out of this together, okay? And we'll find Helen and we'll all get outta here, okay? - Okay. Promise. - I promise, I promise. - Okay. - Here, here, here. Slow, slow! Okay. We're getting close, I think. Careful. I think she's right there. - Yeah. Oh, my God. Turn off the light! Turn off the light! - Helen! - Oh my God. - Oh, my gosh, how... - What are they doing? - I don't know. - Is she alive? - I don't know. We gotta do something. - Oh, God. Okay. I have an idea. Give me my tech. - Yeah. Here, here. - All right. - What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna reboot him. - Reboot him? Why didn't we think of that before? - We were too far away for me to access his programming. - Okay. Well, you think you can do it? - The firewall! - Oh, God. Can you bypass it? - Yeah, I think so. - Helen, Helen, hang in there, please. - Okay, I'm working on it, I'm working on it. Okay. All right, okay, yeah, yeah. - Hurry. - Oh, God. Okay. - Oh, shit, they found us. - Okay. - Come on, come on, do something. Hurry, come on! - It's not working, Luke. It's not working. Okay, I think I can find another way in. - They're coming! Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry! - Okay, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going. - They're getting closer, Chloe! Do something! Hurry! - Work, damn it, work! - Come on, hurry! - Okay, okay, I can't do it. There! Got it! - Protect makers. Protect. Protect. - Chloe, good job! Good job! Helen, get over here! Get over here! Hurry. - You're alive! You're alive! - I felt myself going, but I think you interrupted it. I'm so sorry for everything I ever said bad about you. - Yeah, apparently. Gosh, Helen, what did they do to you? - Are you an alien? - I hope not. Oh, my. - God, we gotta get outta here, guys. Shit, look! He's fighting back! - Protect! - Hey! - Must... pro... ...tect. Protect-tect-tect. - Chloe! - Roll it! - Roll what? For what? - If he dies, we die. We have to let the world know invasion is here. I'm Helen Martin. I'm here with my friends, Chloe Coyle and Luke Sullivan. What started off as a science experiment in the mountains turned out to be a nightmare. Behind me is what I can only describe as invaders in a large craft with the sole intention to abduct and exterminate us. - Oh! Guys, it's falling! Go, go, go, take cover! Come on, come on! Move, move, move! - Go, go, go! - But you must have known that your robot couldn't be controlled by a simple line of code. - It was more than just a simple line of code. We couldn't have been prepared for what happened! - Well, you could have been more prepared if you'd been more forthcoming with your friends. - Why does he keep saying that? - Luke... What? - Come on, Miss Martin. Tell him. - Some of Hornet's parts, some of his parts, the professor didn't build on his own. He said he acquired them. - Acquired them? From where? - I don't know exactly, but the technology was so far more advanced than anything that I had ever seen before, that the power source, the weapons, we realized that it had an old configuration. It was a robot, but some of the parts were missing, and we... - Yeah, and you just kept that from me this whole time. - Sorry. I...the professor told me that we couldn't say anything. And the technology was so advanced, I couldn't. - That's bullshit, Helen! This whole time we were attacked, you didn't tell me? So the attack on us, it had everything to do with Hornet and you knew it! You knew it! - I couldn't know that for sure, Luke! - That's cold. That's really cold. - Luke, help us find Hornet. - Screw you! I'm not telling you anything! - Look, if Hornet remains activated, who knows what could happen? We have to find him and shut him down! Now he was able to track you somehow in the mountains. Is there any way for you to track him? - Luke... - What? - Don't. - Give me a good reason why not. - Because we can't trust this guy! - And I can trust you? - After everything that we've seen? How do we know that he's the government? Luke, we have been friends for six months! Does that not count for anything? - Not if Chloe's gone. - I believe that she's okay, but if we're gonna find her, we have to stick together. - That may work for a while, but eventually you'll turn on each other. - You don't know us. - Humans are weak. I know you more than you think. - Sounds like you weren't hugged that much as a child. [ chuckles ] - Helen's right. You can do whatever you want to me. It's not gonna tear me apart. It's not gonna tear us apart. Game over. - Game over. - Pity. Have it your way. [ explosion ] - Stay there! - Hornet? - [ Screams ] - Knock, knock, Helen Martin. - Hornet? - Hornet has come to save friends. - Where's Chloe? - Hornet returned Chloe to hospital. She is resting. - How can we trust you? - Hornet, what is your primary directive? - Primary directive: Saving you assholes.
