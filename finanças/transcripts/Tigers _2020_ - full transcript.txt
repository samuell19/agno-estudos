Sorry. -So you screamed like that in front of everyone? -Yes, I was used to Swedish wedges. When I became a professional down there and sat on one dinner and they would say something I thought: "Wow, I'm driving the pig." It was like player wives, coaches, everything ... That fucking sound, so ... Pigs are much smarter than you think. They feel before they are to be slaughtered. One starts screaming and then it spreads to the whole farm. Terrible. Have you heard it once you never forget it. Anders, is all this from Milan? Salami and cheese. I heard from Peter. Congratulations! Good luck! Thanks. Test. It's just as well you get used to at this meal. -Did you get your own accommodation in the contract? -Yes, they arrange everything. It will go well. What did they pay for him? I do not remember. -There is an old injury on the left hip. -Also kneeling? It looks a little swollen. -How old is he? -Soon seventeen. -He's pretty skinny. -We said that about Coutinho too. And Pirlo. AGENT: Tjena, Disco. Exactly, he's doing his medical now. Well, I saw that Tancredi posted something on Twitter- -but you will be the first to write that it is clear. What are you doing? Nothing. No no... Yes... I would just like to say a few words to little Matti. When you went to kindergarten, they asked all the children what they wanted to be when they grew up -and everyone answered "astronaut". Except you. You said, "I want to be a 'football puff'." And it is clear that I as a mother have been worried sometimes- -when you are eight years old crawls home from training- -because you have trained so hard. But so is it which I admire with you. I'm not very happy that you're moving. We've taken it. We've talked about it. God, sorry ... I also understand that this is a chance you only get once in a lifetime- -so let's toast. Go down and make us proud. Do you play yourself? -No. -Or how, you do. Nice. Did you invite dad? No. So ... No, I did not. Do you think he knows what happened? In other words... I do not know. I have no idea. No idea actually. I go to bed. Do not sit up for too long. -You have to leave early. -Good night. Do you like the song? Certainly. An old Italian song. -Mr. Bengtsson. Welcome. -Thanks. Follow me. -How was the trip? -Very good. Does anyone have a pen? You are welcome. Thanks. Up with the chin a little, as if you had just signed on. Both Chelsea and Ajax tried to recruit him. -Is not it beautiful? -Yes, very. You will start in our Primavera team ... It's like a lock between the youth academy and the A-team. Just a step away from this. Excuse, but I think I would get my own room. Okay. I do not know, but I'll check. This is your Italian number. I live in the basement, if you need me. So ... you do not speak Italian? Sorry, English only. I'm going to take Italian lessons. Poor bastard. Hi. Hi. My name is Martin. Wouldn't he be Swedish? Looks like a gypsy. How old do you think he is? Twelve? Guaranteed innocence. How long does he think he will stand? -Three weeks. -I guess in ten days. -500, we bet. -500 euros. Taken. Hi. Hi mom. That's me. No, but it ... It's good. Shit. Everything feels very professional. Everyone is older, but they seem good. Nice and so on. It's in my contract that I should have my own room, so it works out. Come on! Focus, focus! Okay, guys. Today we play against the A-team, so I want you to give 200% on the pitch. Bengtsson in the inner midfield with Tonolli. Luca and Karl forwards, Edmund and Christian on the right wing. Okay? You start in the inner midfield. Focus. They will have to toil. Come on! Good job, Bengtsson. Good work. Good job, Bengtsson. There you go! Good. What is the problem? Pass the ball. Shut up and play. Bengtsson, I told you to hold your position! Can I sit here? Is anyone sitting here? No, sit down. Trust me. Okay... - Do you also live in the house? -Yes. But I've been gone a few days on national team assignments. I'm American. Then I guess you were expensive. How so? Because everyone already hates you. Ten more minutes! Come on. Do not complain! Brother, she plays in a completely different league. Fucking...! What the hell...? -Do you know how to open a bank account? -Certainly. That's for my sign-on bonus. Did you get a sign-on? How much? I do not know. Of course you know. How much? Euro? What are you going to do with them? I do not know. Buy a guitar or something. Are you going to buy a fucking guitar? You can buy a hundred fucking guitars for that money. You have to think bigger. What have you been fantasizing about ever since you were little? Come here, kids! Schyst. Small animals ... Do you have something a little ... cheaper? Okay. We have used this the most as signage. -What happens? -You, turn it off. Pull it up. Up. You will need to drive. -You can not drive? -I'm 16. I'm forgetting it. -But you can drive? -No. Not at all? Your dad never let you take the wheel? Oh my God! What are you doing? Your turn. You start by inserting the key and turn it. Then? But you know what the gas and the brake are? No. No... -Are you kidding? -I have no idea. I can guess. Do not guess. Damn, you should buy a vending machine. If I had known, I would have said so. On the right side you have the gas. -Brake in the middle. To the left the coupling. -Cool. Ready? Drive. Okay. It could have been worse. You could have crashed. We will try again. -Here we go. -Three, two, one, run! -Slowly? -Yes, slowly. You can of course! -Yes! -We're moving! This is what it should look like! So damn good! What the hell are you doing? -Should I...? -Straight. Switch. Switch, come on. Okay, man. Check. This is the car's cock. Show it a little respect. -Take this curve. -Here? -You can of course. -Okay. Continue. What the hell are you looking at me for? Run, run, run! Yes! Try it here. - Do you have your own room? -Yes, the other guy was promoted Damn! -How many are promoted each year? -One, max two. -And how many have to leave? -Five or six. But now that you came, maybe one of the guys will be fired in the middle of the season. Should I be worried because someone will try to do something? Two years ago we had a Portuguese striker. Walter constantly hacked at him, until one day he slapped him in the mouth. The next day he was fired, so ... ... if you give them a chance to destroy you ... ... they will take it. Come on! What is happening? Why are you freezing me out? In Primavera it pays off whether we win or lose. It's all about proving that one is worthy of being promoted. Forget the team. This is not a match, it's a fucking audition. Come on! It is quiet. -Dario, you take the free kick. -Come here. Come here! It is quiet. I take it. Hit it on the far post, okay? -Come on, Martin! -What the hell is the Swede doing? So damn easy. So damn easy! What are you listening to? -What is this? -It's mine... -My winning song. -Winning song? If I played well I listen to it after the match. Only if you played well? Okay, imagine that you will be promoted to Prima Squadra. Or sold to fucking Real Madrid. You walk out of the player house in slow motion, turns you on ... ... look all these bastards in the eye and only... "Now I'm leaving, you bastards!" Is this the song you hear then? Yes. You're a damn weird guy. Fuck off! What are you watching? What the hell are you watching? You bastards! Move! Move on, damn it! Move on to hell! -I'm gonna kill you. -What has happened? He was poked. -Stop. Calm down. -It's not fair. I know, but you have to calm down. Do not break down, brother. Do not break. Come on! Come on. No! Here I am, Sweden. -Release! -Stop! Do not do it. He just wants to drag you into the case. Come on, gay bastard. Hit me. It is enough! Silent. Be quiet for a moment. I want to bring a bowl. A toast to Walter. I do not understand that the club is poking you. It feels like yesterday as we came to Interello. How old were we? Tio, elva? We've seen everything. We have experienced good times, bad times. The most important thing is that we grew up together. You will land on your feet. I know. -For Walter! -For Walter! Drink, drink! Water! I want water! Water! Water! Here is water. Drink it. -Shit on you! -Calm down. -Fucking cock head! -Let it be. -Fuck off! -Stick from here, damn it. Did you like the female bear? -Walter! -Where the hell are you going? Walter! Come down. - You're hurting yourself, Walter. -You have to come down. -Walter, stop. Get down from there. -Stop it now. Come down. Come down! What are you doing? You're all fucking idiots! Fucking gays! I'm gonna fuck you all in the ass! Come on. Jump, then. -What did he say? -Not damn I know. Jump! Jump ... Jump ... Jump... Jump, jump, jump! -Shit on is! I'll pee on you! -What the hell are you doing? -I'm going to pee on you. -Dario, climb up and take him down. I? I'm worth 500,000 euros. What is he worth? A cheeseburger? I can not... I'll spray you, you bastards. Fucking cock heads. Where the hell are you going? I'm squirting on you. Fuck off. Hi then, Walter. You can all go to hell! "Excuse me, what time are the rhinos fed?" "Excuse me, what time are the rhinos fed?" "What nice shoes." BENGTSSON LEADS INTER TO VICTORY Can we have two beers, old lady? And two linguine al gorgonzola from your secret menu? This guy is celebrating an important birthday. -Oh really? How old is he? -30. He's my big brother. Has taught me everything I can. Sure, and I'm Beyoncé. Good, right? In Sweden, we have a saying. "It's so good it's fucking in your mouth." In English it means: "It's good enough to fuck you in the mouth. " You're funny! -Did not you know that? -No, actually not. Now you know. It's dating? No, it's my mother. So not immediately. What does she work with? She takes care of old people. And your dad? I do not know. What do you mean by that? I do not know. When did you last meet him? -Does it matter? -No. Then why do you ask? Sorry. Stop it, guys ... On Sunday we have the most important match of the season. But we'll play with our heads held high, without holding back. It does not matter that we meet Juventus away. I want you to be charged. Excuse me. A mistake has been made. What kind of mistake? Should I not play? No. On Sunday you play with Allievi Nazionali. -What is Allievi Nazionali? -U17. The youth team. Va? Have I been relegated? I guess so. What the hell? Did he throw the shirt on the ground !? Bengtsson! Director Galli wants to talk to you. -Signor Bengtsson is here. -Show him in. I see a change in you. Particularly in the match you played with Allievi Nazionali. It will not happen again. I was the one who told Panelli not to let you play against Juve. I was curious how you would take it. You understand... Talent development is often seen as something mythical. Who can do it, who can not. The difference between the player going out into the gutter at eighteen -and the one like six months later is worth EUR 40 million. - Do you want to know the secret? -Yes. At this level, talent, technology and speed -subordinate to something else- -something that is much harder to scout. A hunger. A desperation in the eyes that says: "I would rather die than fail." But what is it in a human being? A void, a defect? Men då hade Ibra den defekten. Pirlo, Materazzi, Zanetti. De var aldrig nöjda. De bara visste att de måste kämpa framåt, framåt, framåt. Förstår du? Därför är jag, till skillnad från många kollegor- -inte så intresserad av dem som spelar sig ur slummen. Deras desperation sitter inte i själen. Den är materiell. Så fort de skriver på sitt första kontrakt är deras hunger stillad för alltid. Men den hunger, den desperation jag såg i din blick den här helgen- -är en kamp mot något annat. Du ska inte spela med Primavera den här veckan heller. -Varför inte? -Du har blivit uttagen till A-laget. -Jag ska spela med...? -Ja. Sampdoria. Hemma på San Siro. -Gratulerar. -Tack. MAMMA: Tror du att du får spela nåt då? Har de sagt nåt? Jag vet inte. Jag börjar ju på bänken. Det här är ju vad du har drömt om. Nu är du där, liksom! Jag vet. Allt är bra. Allt är bra. -Nu kör vi, grabbar! -Nu kör vi! Bengtsson, Ali. Come on, go and warm up. Shall we play? No, we'll just warm up. Bravo, Bengtsson. Hello? -Hello. Where have I come from? -Who is it? Someone called me from this issue before. Mikael, I think. It's my dad. Can I talk to him? Dad, it rang in your cell phone ... -Yes, it's Micke. Hello? -Hello. Is that you, Matti? I saw you called. Yes, exactly. I just wanted to say that I watched the match, and it was ... -Wow, that ... -Yes it is... Do you thrive down there in Italy? Yes that is good. Very ... professional. -Yes, I can imagine that. -Yes. Good jaw and such. I'll never forget that time when you crawled home from training. You had driven so damn hard. -And now you're there as well. You get proud. -Thanks. Dad, who are you talking to? Wait a minute, old lady. How is it otherwise, then? Is everything good? I thought that ... it would be fun to see you sometime. I have thought so many times that I should ... Dad, now they're calling here ... Men! Yes! -Congratulations! -We go out and celebrate. Absolutely. Yes! Get some glasses. Ladies ... Come and celebrate with us. -You have heard of Martin Bengtsson, haven't you? -No. -Where are you from? -Japanese. California. -Berlin. -Berlin? Schyst. -And you? -She is from Stockholm. Let me guess. You are, of course, in Milan to work as a ... plumber? -Right close. -Right close? Hey! -Have you met my husband? -Sorry, I did not know. We got married last year. -On a boat. -Okay. Sorry. I'm not picking on you. I just needed ... -... a little help. -It is quiet. Thanks. -Do you like this? -The song? -Yes. -No. -What do you like about music then? -It's a fairly personal question. -No, it's not. -Yes. We do not know each other. -Get to know me then. -Okay... ...who are you? I am... ...footballer. Although I did not ask what you do, but ... No... Sorry, I did not really have the strength listen to your keffa friend before. Are you celebrating something? Yes, we celebrate that I. made my first A-team match with Inter. And that's a ... big thing? It's ... the only thing I've dreamed of since I was type three. So when you were type three, you sat at home and thought "one day I will play with ..." -Inter. -Inter. Dad was in the Italian league so we watched some at home. And you? Did you come here to work? Model? It's not like this was the dream, as well. The... It just happened. Like borrowing someone else's life or something. What do you want to be, then? Do you have to know that? What do you want to be? I'm this. Football. What then? I have worked as a model since I was about fifteen- -and have never seen anyone have such anxiety over eating some french fries. -It's about 25,000 calories! -No. Bride, join us instead. -You can dream of that. Do you speak fluently? Type. Say something, then. He would not look as a football player- -if it were not for the awful glasses and the terrible jacket. Okay... Do you understand? No, my vocabulary is ... like that. Say something, then. Offside. Pass the ball. Damage. What nice shoes! Yellow card. - No thanks. Judge bastard. Pasta, please. Pig bastard! More! More! Special offer. Pizza, pasta ... Hop on. I wake up, I eat. I train, I sleep. I wake up, I eat, I exercise, I sleep. What nice shoes! What time is fed ... What nice shoes. What time are the rhinos fed? What time are the rhinos fed ... More. More. No, listen ... I sprained my foot because the photographer asked me to jump. So I jumped. How can it be my fault? Okay sure. Hello. Agencies? What did they say? The same ordinary, old shit about being tired, thick and old. And so the foot on it. Wait. Take it. -But they can not kick you? -Of course they can. -But are you not afraid of it? Yours is damn worse than mine ... When I lived in Tokyo an old man appeared after a viewing -and paid $ 500 for my used tights. Completely bloody in the foot. -What then, that he would jerk off to? -I did not ask. -Why did you not ask? -It was obvious that he would do it. What is the background image? It's a tiger. Who eats a human? Eating up and eating up ... It was taken at a zoo in China. Some poor tiger which they had there for twenty years -and then one day when the attendant arrives, so ... -It's a nice picture, just. -A nice picture ... What then? Imagine yourself. They've had it locked up for about twenty years and decided what to do and eat- -and sold tickets for people to stare at the days in -and so they have thought that it has got used to it and that it has, as it were, given up. But really it has gone around and just waited and waited and waited- -and waited and waited ... You see it in your eyes. "You thought you knew everything about me. You thought you could tame me. " "But you do not know what I'm capable of." -So the tiger speaks English? Shut up! Yes, the tiger speaks English! Shut up out there too. Shut up. What are you doing out here, Bengtsson? -What the hell are you writing? -Nothing. We have a team meeting in five minutes. Hurry up. This bag was found by chance inside the house. We do not know who it belongs to. But I expect ... ... that the owner comes to me and says: "Mister, it's mine." -Otherwise... -Otherwise we start getting rid of people. It can be anyone. We have been too kind. Luca has not been able to protect you from everyone dangers that threaten a football professional. Therefore, we strengthen the security of the house. From now on you have to ask Luca if you want to go out. The rooms will be inspected regularly. There are dozens of guys of you caliber out there just waiting. They are ready to take your place. Ready to do anything to get the same chance as you. Hey. Where are you? -Ute. And you? -I'm sitting on the tram to Vibeke. I just... - Do you know whose drugs are? -No. Are you not afraid that the Italians will say that are they yours or mine to get rid of us? Are you calling from the SIM card Luca gave you? Yes, why? Do not talk about this on the phone. He's free. Cover him! What the hell are you doing! Hell! -What the hell? -He was yours! Come on now! Come on! Do you know what that was? It was shameful. Embarrassing. None of you did what I asked. No! Bengtsson, what did you do when they scored? -I marked my player. -Oh really? I apologize. You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh? that I do not know a shit about football? The star has arrived, the prodigy. He played 10 minutes in Serie A. and now he knows everything. Do you know why they let you play 10 minutes with the big boys? To increase your value if they are forced to sell you. What a serious mine, Mr Bengtsson. Just because your families are visiting today does not mean you have a holiday. We will work as hard as ever. I want focus! You, Swedese? How much did you pay for her? Tonolli! What exactly did I say? You do not have a holiday. Come here! What the hell are you doing? Bengtsson! Are you not really smart? Get off the plan! What is going on? Have you lost focus? Martin! It's not just me who sees it. Everyone is talking about it. Hey... How did you get in? Climb. Come then. Hello... Whose car is this? My. Do you have a car? You are not even allowed to drive ... No... But you own a car? We have a curfew after ten. It's like a fine of 10,000 because I'm sitting here. So no music? -No. -And we can not talk? Come on. Live a little. Damn, you could not have bought a bigger car? What are you doing? Close the door. Close the bastard! It's against the rules. Send the slut home. She must not be here. This is private property, and she must sting. Roger? Luca, close the door. -Close it! -Hurry up! -Who the hell is that? -Fuck! Who the hell is that? Can I have my shirt? I will call you tomorrow. I have to make a change. Fast! What is it, Bengtsson? Hard to breathe. Something is off. A rib or something. Are you okay? Yes. I can not drive in town. What's the worst that could happen? That's my agent. Hey, Danny! How's the situation, man? No. No, thank you, I do not want to ... Fucking idiot! You almost took my life! -What happens? -Nothing, it's just ... They sold me. -Va? -That bastards sold me. -Where? -Some fucking club in the Dutch second division. Damn, I knew it. The Italians said it was yours. -We can arrange it. -How? -We can talk to someone and explain ... -Explain what then? -We can declare you innocent ... -That I'm innocent? -We explain that ... -Grow up, damn it! Sorry, Mr Bengtsson. Director Galli wants to talk to you. I have good news and bad news. -What do you want to start with? -The good ones. Every year Gazzetta ranks the hundred greatest talents in Europe. This year you are number 8, best in Italy. Congratulations. Francesca, you can look for if the fax from Rome has arrived? Of course, Mr Galli. At the same time, I hear things that worry me. Do you know what I'm talking about? You have been approached with girls in the area. A girl. I've seen many talents like you, who thought they could go their own way. Do you know where they are now? Nowhere. Without us, they were nothing. They had to go home as failures. They had to meet relatives and friends ... ... and explain that they swamped the chance of a lifetime. Mr Bengtsson, look at me. We give you the chance every kid dreams of. Do not throw it away. Hey! There was a man who sang here before. -Fine. -Romantic ... Are you not going to take off your jacket? That's something I have to say. I can not be with you anymore. Sorry. All my life I have fought and fought for this. I can not sabotage it by ... Through... By being with me? Fuck you. I kind of do not require you to understand. -In order to...? -Because we are different. And because you do not know what you want with your life. -And you know that? -Yes. I feel so damn sorry for you, you know that? Hi, Matti! I was just about to call you. I read about the ranking. -Congratulations! -Thanks. -How are you going to celebrate this, then? -I do not know. Before I forget I'll say hello to a lot of people. Agneta Wannström. Do you remember her? Redhead. You had her at leisure. I met her at Coop. Then Ann-Sofi wonders, my boss, if it can be fixed- -some pennant signed to her son? And so it was ... Exactly! Peter Larsson's parents wanted ... What is it that sounds? Nothing. You have to say something funny. Otherwise you will die. Say something fun. God! Oh my God! Help... Please ... What happened? I thought it was a dog. -Renata, call an ambulance. -Is anyone injured? -Call the ambulance, just. -I was sure it was a dog. Hello? Hello! Hello? Maybe it's better that we speak English. Martin ... Do you remember what happened? You were hit by a truck, but you were lucky. Very very lucky. Three broken ribs and a few small wounds. That's all. The truck had slowed down before the next exit. Then you were lucky which is not sucked in under the wheels. Tell him he had an angel guard. -How do you say it in English? -No clue. You had God on your side. You will be fine. Everyone greets you. The guys, Panelli ... Thanks. Listen... Some journalists have already heard about the accident. The Gazzetta has interviewed the driver, so ... ... we probably have to prepare a statement from the club. But first we need to find out why this happened. Enzo and his team have a theory. We believe you may have had an epileptic seizure. -when you were jogging along the highway. Does that sound ... reasonable? Perhaps. -We must of course test you to be safe. -Yes of course. Enzo, thank you. I think that was all for now. There may be a place in the A-team in January ... ... after the transfer window, just so you know. Do you remember the day when we met at the San Siro? I was silent for a while and looked you in the eyes. -Yes? -I always do. Because I do not just want to know what I'm buying, but also who I buy. In your eyes, Martin, I saw a personal -who is ready to make sacrifices to get where he wants. Was I wrong? No. Martin. Someone wants to meet you. Honey, hey. Sorry. Darling... The heart ... Gently. How do you want me to do? Do you want me to plays in this epilepsy ... Do you want that? I know I've not always been there, that I was busy with my ... Stop. I should have been like two parents- -but sometimes I have not even managed to be one. Sit down. Please. -I have epilepsy. -No. Yes I have. You just have to know that that when dad had moved ... ... and we had sold the house ... ... so I do not know how many times when I went home from work- -and came to the bridge thought that: "I shit in this. I shit in it." "People will just think it's an accident." But you have to trust me when I say that it will not always feel like this. I'm screwed. No. Darling... Honey, just shit in this and come home. -Then damn everything has been meaningless. -Really not. Yes. You decided to become something and you became it- -but that does not mean that it is the only thing you will ever be able to be. You have to change, do you understand that? You have to change. What the hell am I supposed to do then? Tell me what to do. Tell me what to do! I do not know, but I do not intend to sit here and pretend you have a fucking epilepsy. Then you go out and jumps in front of a new, fucking truck. -I do not agree with that. -Say what to do! -No. What do you want to do? -It does not work that way. -I shit in how it works. What do you want to do? -Stop! What do you want? The brain waves will provide more information about your epilepsy. You just need to stay awake. -And if it does not show anything? -Don't worry about it. Signore ... Where are you going?
