Hey, let's go! HOMELESS FOOTBALL WORLD CUP IS THE ONLY TOURNAMENT THAT ADVOCATES FOR THE END OF HOMELESSNESS AND CHALLENGES NEGATIVE SOCIAL PERCEPTION THROUGH THE SPORT OF FOOTBALL THIS IS A DRAMATIZATION OF THE 2010 EVENTS WHEN KOREA FIRST PARTICIPATED IN HWC ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS, NAMES, INCIDENTS, AND DIALOGUES ARE WORKS OF FICTION, AND ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REAL LIFE COUNTERPARTS IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL YOON HONG-DAE Cut him off! Turn back! A question for Park Sung-chan. As the captain this season... - Park Sung-chan... - Park... What would you say to your fellow Red Champions players... How do you feel about your foreign language skills? Nonexistent. This one's for Park Sung-chan! How do you feel about the last game before your Big League debut? Big League is important, but I consider today's game to also be an important match, so I'd like to put Big League aside and focus on the game. - He finally got the ball! - Yes! Park, who was in full defensive mode, is on the run! Yoon is also running! A question for Yoon Hong-dae. Your mother is currently wanted. Are you helping her escape? Please ask questions pertaining to the match. He's incredibly fast! Very good! Look at Yoon Hong-dae go! He's going for it. It's amazing! A question for Yoon Hong-dae. Your mother's life on the run... Excuse me. Please refrain from using the phrase "on the run." - Your mother is a fugitive. - Excuse me! Where will she be watching the game? Red Champions' decisive chance! Two defenders and three strikers! Yoon has to keep some distance! Yes, he should. He has to stay back! He won't stay back! He's running alongside! - I've never seen this before. - Never, ever seen this! - Never seen it! - Never seen this! - Have you? - No, never! You crazy bastard! Get the hell out! - Is this an amateur football league? - Seriously. Pack it up now! Got another team to play with next year? Easy! If this doesn't suit you, just quit! - You call this football? - Coach! Come on! I know you're feeling like crap lately, but even still... Then again, when would we ever see a player guarding his teammate? Was it a confusion tactic to chase down your teammate? The opponent was confused too! What was that? Did the coach order you to? Was it a performance of some kind? A way to mock the dumb police who can't catch your mother? - You have pretty eyes. - I had them done last year. I got an employee discount thanks to my sister. YOON HONG-DAE HIGHLIGHTS DAMN! FERAL REPORTER APPEARS! HE ATTACKS HONG-DAE'S MOM! NO DAMAGE HONG-DAE'S EYE ATTACK! IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE! NICE! REPORTER HAS BEEN DEFEATED! Hilarious. - How many articles are up so far? - 142, including regional outlets. Is he a K-pop star? Why are people so interested? I believe the unique method of assault drew a lot of attention. Most assault cases consist of throwing punches, but the eye poke is a rare incident. You little... Has the victim agreed to settle? He has, but disciplinary action from the association still stands. I want to retire. Why worry about disciplinary action? - It's not the right time. - It's like a dishonorable discharge. What does it matter? Will an honorable discharge get you freebies? You can't take showbiz lightly. Hey! "Light." How's Ho-rak as his stage name? As in "joyous and light," Ho-rak. Do other agencies have meetings like this? Let's clean up Ho-rak's reputation and welcome him to showbiz. Have ten different proposals by 3:00 p.m. and regroup. - It's 1:00 p.m. right now. - What? Make it 2:00 p.m. Adjourned. No way! Forget it! Get back here. You have three seconds. One, two, three! I knew you wouldn't. It'd be weirder if you did. Listen till the elevator arrives. I knew it. It's a four-story building. It doesn't take long, yeah? Don't you need money for your mother's settlement? I asked for a TV show, and you got me the homeless football world cup? Do I look homeless? Homeless or not, I only think about whether I can use you to make money. You sure talk a lot of shit. Because I'm a bad guy. Bad guys talk like shit. Come inside. Sorry, I'm late! You're not late. I guess not. My life is so hectic that it always feels like I'm late. Living a busy life does that. Hello, I wasn't a fan, but I've been glued to your news. Ho-rak, right? I heard you changed your name. It's a stage name. Documentary producer Lee So-min. She's good at filming those tearjerkers. She'll work for the same pay as someone much younger. It turns out my passion doesn't pay enough. So I toned down my passion accordingly, and I found peace of mind. Man, what a diligent worker! May I cut to the chase and brief you? We must not lose momentum. Good. Straight to the point. He fell. Don't use your hands. Use your feet. Don't take someone else's ball! Stop! Please stop! Goal! Very good! That was close! That almost went in from my angle! You all did so well today. I'm pleased with today's session. You just need to keep this up. One, two, three! - Let's go! - Let's go! It's hard to tell if they're playing football or doing martial arts, but it is indeed football. You've witnessed the national athletes who will play in the Homeless Football World Cup in Hungary in two months. They're representing our country? Can you feel the drama? Thank you so much. Despite this project highlighting an underprivileged group, it was on the verge of getting canceled, but since Ho-rak is donating his talent to the cause... Who's donating talent? I'm quitting because I have no talent. Fine, quit. Quit and make your showbiz debut. Your face is your talent. Do a good deed, finish this season without any trouble, and retire with a positive public image. You have huge potential in showbiz. - I'll donate some money instead. - You don't have money. Oh, you're penniless? Don't you get that urge to listen to me? What you need now is a tearjerker. Forget it, seriously. - Create that positive image. - No, I won't. That's all right. Keep saying no, but the weak must comply. - You know that! - Whatever! This is our coach who will train us and accompany us to the World Cup. - Please say hello. - Hello, everyone. I'll be joining you all from today... Shit, I can't do this... I didn't sign up for some PSA... Cut! - Cut! - Cut! That's a cut. That was slightly awkward. Let's do another take. Another what? What kind of documentary has a script? It's got a plot twist too. Let's go one more time. You all did amazing. What? What is it? "What? What is it?" If you're going to con me, do it with a straight face. What is this? - Could I have a word with you? - Yes! Over there. My facial muscle's getting old. It's so hard to smile for so long. Since I'm younger, I'll speak freely. That doesn't make sense at all. - Then you talk freely too. - All right. Fine. What's with that tone? - Hong-dae. - Better. What is something we both need? Image. Where does that come from? How do you produce a story that moves people to tears? Narrative. We have limited time. Do you think we'll get what we want organically in two months? Who are you? What's your deal? Who am I? Who cares about that? I have a stagnant life ruined by student loans. Good enough? Someone once told me, "Our fabulous life is like a one-act show." Show? It doesn't have an ending. I make it up as I go. Cool, huh? What if you fall off the stage? You'd become a laughingstock. What must you do to prevent that? You listen to the experts to minimize risk. - And you're the expert? - Yes, me. I see. Now smile. Ho-rak. Smile, okay? Are you batshit crazy? You're not normal. Being crazy in this crazy world is normal, no? Weird. She's right about everything. Seeing you all run, I felt ashamed of the despair that was brewing inside me. It's as if my heart wants to beat once more. We'll start the roster selection! Director, reveal the banner! HOMELESS FOOTBALL WORLD CUP ROSTER SELECTION SPRINT TEST Bang! The selection process is a formality. It's based on how pitiful their story is. That's how drama is created. Pretend to think about it, and then pick these people. Okay! Get ready! Kim Hwan-dong, 55. Head of a mid-size business who left his family for booze and girls, and his company failed during the IMF era. Typical soap opera material. - It's 9,87. - Thirty meters in nine seconds? DRIBBLE TEST Son Beom-su, 44. His background isn't anything special, but he has a lady he loves dearly, and she has a mental disability. It's a melodrama that surpasses poverty and disability. I HATE MELODRAMA BE MELODRAMATIC BALL TRAPPING TEST Jeon Hyo-bong, 44. He has a pre-teen daughter with his ex-wife, but his ex remarried an Australian, so they'll be immigrating to Australia soon. An inevitable farewell, a sad drama. Kick as hard as you can! Kick hard! He kicked too hard! All right. Let's go. - Good luck! - You can do it! Go for it! Jeon Moon-su, 39. Self-proclaimed ex-gangster. He says he's pretending to be homeless since he's on the run, but he's the perfect scene-stealer. Don't lose sight of my ball! I'm gonna kick it inside! His personality is unpredictable. When I was seven or so... I begged my mother to buy me a football... but she said she hated football. Just shoot the ball, dude! My legs became restless without a ball to kick, so I started kicking my friends instead. That was the start of the violence. I get it, so kick the ball! What's the matter? HOMELESS FOOTBALL WORLD CUP FINAL ROSTER Our drama has everything. Even a rude, young punk. You take your pills regularly? Lack of money for pills turned me into this. As the coach, you may choose the final member. Happy? Sure, thanks. I was thinking about him. He won't tell us his story. I found it interesting and ironic how optimistic he is. Having a home doesn't mean you'll be warm in the winter, so it doesn't matter. I've never won anything in life anyway. If I don't know what that feels like, losing doesn't mean much either. Don't you think so? He's got a great physique. It's just an opinion. Okay, thanks for your opinion. I couldn't eat anything because I was worried. But you've become chubby. Did you stuff yourself while on the run? It's tough being on the run on an empty stomach. Your joke is boring. Why did you want to see me? Hey. What's this I'm hearing about you giving up football for showbiz? I didn't sign anything, so I'm broke. You catch on so quickly. Please stop with obvious crap! Don't be angry with me. You're scaring me. You scare me more! What have you done as a mom other than lose all my money and steal from your friends? I've done mom stuff! You got this far because of my prayers! You're not even religious! I've been going to church for two months. Two months. Someone's tailing you. I'll stop him, so start running. He's from my church. You met a guy, even in this... Why? He's a good man. His faith is strong, but more importantly... he hides me well. I know how tough it's been for you lately. Sorry. Here. His business card. Keep it safe. Call me when you sign your contract. Okay, son? I'll pray for you. Jesus... Bye. Beom-su quit the team yesterday. He has a good story. Why didn't you stop him? We never pressure anyone to do this. It's meaningless unless it's done voluntarily. Convincing and bringing him back are our tasks today. Give me the script. Beom-su said he was born homeless. He relied on his relatives until he started construction work at 17. His dream was to put down a deposit for a small home. His savings were growing slowly until one day... Hey, what happened? What little money he saved was quickly used up to treat his ongoing medical expenses. He couldn't seem to fully recover, so he lost all hope. When it turned into a chronic illness, he began living on the streets. Goddamn. Let's right the wrongs of this chaotic world. Sons of bitches! Indiscriminate violence against the homeless is a frequent occurrence. While fighting a high fever, he wished he'd fall asleep and never wake up. There was nothing left that made him want to keep going. At that moment... Ouch. It was the first time someone made his pain go away. He's still moving from place to place, but to help pay rent for Jin-ju, whom he loves dearly... Bye. ...he's on the street selling magazines every day. Big Issue! 3,000 won! A magazine for the homeless! Big Issue! Your voice is too loud. You're scaring people away. It's odd. I haven't sold a single copy since you showed up. I don't need your help. Can you just leave? - Come on. - Big Issue! It's 3,000 won! Big Issue! You were training so hard. Why give that up? I didn't train hard. It was tough becoming a national athlete. - It wasn't tough. - I guess not. I'm actually not well. I know you've gotten better while playing football. Jin-ju's rent has gone up by 20,000 won. I have to sell ten of these to make that. I think I can if you go away. Come on! Big Issue! It's 3,000 won! I'll just give you 20,000 won. Do you take me for a beggar? Big Issue! 3,000 won! - Big Issue! - Big Issue! Stop it! I said go away! I was only trying to help. No need to embarrass me. I want to sell ten of these! It's only possible with you gone! Why are you screaming at me? - Because I can't hear! - You hear me fine! What did you say? - This is such a luxury. - Jeez... But Jin-ju loves eggs and bread. She'd go nuts for these. She'd go crazy. She doesn't normally talk, but while eating this, she says, "Delicious." I'm doing this just to hear her voice. How could I leave her behind for a week? Then let me get a few shots of you two eating egg buns. And a short interview! She won't talk. She really won't. Football player. Handsome. I like football player. Zoom in. Pass! Here! I'm open! Go long! How did you do it? Well, I ate a delicious egg bun... Bring it in for a moment. Are you trying to kill yourself? Why are you doing this? Hwan-dong. Why is a forward on defense? You even caused a foul. He looked tired. That's why. You fouled because your teammate looked tired? That's an interesting approach. And your play is too predictable. We practiced winding back before the kick. I'll remember that. All right. After the seven-minute first half, the halftime isn't long. And if you overdo it like him, you'll die. Conserve your energy accordingly. Back to your positions! To your positions! Moon-su! Since you're taking this seriously, it's all coming together. I'm just reading my script. Hyo-bong, pass! Good! - Block Hwan-dong! - Go! Stop him! Hwan-dong! Hwan-dong! Call 911! It's okay. It's not your fault. Then whose fault is it? Is it your fault? You are... the only player who could kick the ball into the goal. My bone will heal in a month. It's just a hairline fracture. Don't cut me. You can't play as soon as your bone heals. Yeah, there's always next year. Next year? I'm an old man. I almost have three million won ready. With that, I can get an apartment. How is that related to... My daughter had a baby. It's a given that my wife and my daughter don't want to see me. When I was on top of the world, and money was overflowing, I neglected my family. Hey! Why the hell are you pissing me off? Whenever I went out, I had a hard time resisting temptation. To recover from an ongoing foreign exchange crisis, IMF, or International Monetary Fund... When you have nothing to fear, you do bad things. I didn't expand my business. I committed crimes. When I was released, I had nothing. I deserved it. Why do you always come here? Oh man. I spent five years begging for booze. Hyun-joo's going through puberty. What good will it do for her to see you like this? I'm not asking for pity... but I didn't drink a drop after that day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. Since this will be on TV, I want them to see me. I don't want them to worry that I'll become a burden. I want them to know that I've changed my ways. I want them to put their worries to rest. I can't allow that. Preventing further injury is the priority. But he so desperately wants to do it. He can take it easy. "Taking it easy" can lead to injuries. You know so little about football. That's why you're here, Coach Ho-rak. We don't have anyone who can actually score a goal. If we're gonna do it, it'd be nice to win. Not just nice. We have to win. So you get it. You get it. There is a young striker, but he rarely comes to practice. I guess he's young. What's his story? How did he become homeless? He suffers from a wounded heart. Why? What is it? Big Issue! Big Issue! 3,000 won! Big Issue! 3,000 won! What? Are you usually this quiet while you're selling this magazine? It's strange. What is? I can't seem to sell anything ever since you showed up. It's strange. That's weird. Is that right? Mr. Kim got hurt because of me. It's not like that. - I thought you could fill his role... - I'll play. I'm sorry. I won't miss practice this time. I mean, I'll do my best. I'm so glad I came to see you. What? Cross. Cross. Is this how I do it? How long do we do this? MISSING PERSON Slow. Go slow. Just a bit more. Faster. He says he'll come, but he never does. Lately, I've been easily tricked by kids pretending to be innocent. It looked like he was looking for someone. Well... His parents tried to commit suicide together when he was seven, but only he managed to survive. It was all over the news back then. Hey, it's the director! You rascals! He had a tough time and suffered from aphasia, but he made a good friend at the orphanage and began to talk and attended school too. How come you got off so early today? I worked over the weekend, you know. They only had each other, but I'm sure that was enough. Wow, we're rich. I'd like for you to stop working at the factory and finish school. You said you wanted to work in an office. Yeah. Then I'll just work until I get my bonus. Okay? Okay. In that final month, the factory organized a company trip. Her body was never found, so he believes she's still alive. I told you not to put these up! This is your last warning. A final warning from a public official is serious business. Got it? Kim In-sun. In-sun, look at me. Hey, look at me! Look over there. See that camera? Our practice sessions and the World Cup games will be broadcast all over the country. You have to let her know that you're looking for her, that you're waiting. - Cross. - Cross! - Good to see you. - That's enough. - Hey, stop. - Hwan-dong! Hey! - Hwan-dong's here too. - All right. Everyone's here! I'll just watch, all right? First two to in! When I was eight or so... I begged my father to buy me a basketball. What should I do about this guy? You have to move fast! Hyo-bong, you're too slow! Beom-su, where are you going? In-sun is first! Keep the pass low and fast! Kick harder! Okay, that's enough! - Okay, very good! - Yes! That's it. Keep going! My shoulder blade! My shoulder blade! - My shoulder blade! - Jeez. Yes! We're supposed to push together. Goodness. Are you missing on purpose? Try kicking it lightly. Be gentle. Hyo-bong, don't try to kick it hard. Just kick it straight. Got it? What? Don't roll it! You need to kick it! Are you all messing with me? It's all right. Well done. Good job! That was awesome. Very good. Nice! Okay! Go. Okay! - Again. - Keep your eyes on the ball. Go. Okay! Okay! - Okay! - It's okay. He can only kick balls that aren't moving. - Okay. - Beom-su's next? I'm gonna kick your ass. You're so stubborn. Why are you competing with me? I'm not even mad because it's just absurd. One, two, one, two, three, four. One, two, one, two, three, four. One, two, one, two, three, four. One, two, one, two... Coach, wait for us! Let's take a break. You'd think I made them do 15 laps or something. Scare them a little. Let's turn this into a heartwarming story. You have enough shots. Let's stop. Just go with it, Ho-rak. Drink water. How are you going to play football like this? We haven't even gotten started! How dare you give up? Who said you could give up just because you're tired? Aren't you guys here to turn over a new leaf? From your physical endurance to your mental strength, it's all trash! I mean, he's not wrong about us being trash. Do you think you're all that? Then show us what you got. Let's have a go. Five of us against you! Whoever scores five goals wins. - For 20,000 won! - He's still a pro. - You have 20,000 won? - 20,000 won? I'll need a goalkeeper. No! Stop him! Block him! Hyo-bong, were you trying to get in my way? You should've stopped him! Let's go! Block him! In-sun, kick it! Damn it! Go long! - Trip him! - Block him! Easy! Stop him! Block him! What is it? What! This is the difference between all of you and me. Dad! Eun-hye! Stop, no. Daddy's sweaty. I smell really bad. Who cares? Eun-hye's here. Is school done? Yes. I know that man. - How? He's not that famous. - It's the eye-poking man, right? You know me? I'm 13 years old, and I get good grades. What kind of a man is your dad? My dad is too nice, like a dummy. That's why bad people take advantage of him. Mom said he cosigned a loan for a friend. And they say cosigning loans ruins families. That turned out to be true. Let's have a bowl of gukbap before we go. I haven't eaten in days. Damn it. Mom said she can't live with him anymore. So, what can I do? Why are you all so loud? You're too loud. Let's go to the supermarket. - Yay! - The supermarket. Eun-hye, you too. Let's go. I will buy you treats. Do we go this way? Dad's too dumb to know, but I knew he came to see me at school. And I'm going to Australia in the fall with the Australian man. That's why Mom's letting me come here. Is there anything you want to do with your dad before you go? I want to live with him until the end of summer break. Your mom won't let you? It's not that. Dad doesn't have a home. What if someone lent him a place? Really? Who would do that? There's someone who will. What? You want it? Not a chance. Enjoy it while you can. Can we really do that? Of course. I'm just sorry that my home is so small. Coach Yoon has such a big heart. - You must be thrilled. - Thank you, Hong-dae. What use is a big heart if the house is small? All of a sudden? I'm so touched. The tournament is in less than two months. What are we supposed to do if you pull your sponsorship this late? You can't put that on me when the deal was never finalized. No, that's not what I meant. - I was just... - Well... Actually, homeless people are known to be dirty and smell disgusting, so our company wasn't sure what kind of reaction our sponsorship would generate. I'm really sorry about that. Then can't you make a donation anonymously? Why would we do that? - Right. - Right? By the way, only a fraction of homeless people smell bad and are dirty. Why would you do something like this? Because someone must! Is there a guarantee that you'll never end up on the streets? Are you certain? If that ever happens, it's nice to know someone will help you. In a way, it's for our own benefit, so we must help! Well, you've made it clear you won't do it, so suit yourself. Anyway, thanks for your time. Have a great day. You have no friends, right? Looks delicious! Let's dig in. Is it good? The taste is so-so. But I'm so happy that I'm eating a meal with you here. When you come back from Australia, I'll have a beautiful home ready. I don't care about that. I'd be happy just to be with you. I'm so happy that you don't take after me. Go on, eat. Eat as much as you want. - You're cute even when you're fat. - Sure. By the way, where is the eye-poking man sleeping? EVERGREEN GOSIWON Eat some eggs. Become taller. Eat two, football player. Do you like football? Do you know any players? Cristiano Ronaldo. Born in 1985. Real Madrid. Messi. Born in 1987. This year, he won Ballon d'Or. Wait a minute. Do you know Balotelli? Bad boy. Ugly. I don't like him. Have this egg. I just need one. Go on, eat. Then do you like Primeira Liga? Premier League... Yes! Premier League is fun. You're a real football fanatic! I'm an FF. FF! Let's eat together! The opponent for our first game has been decided. Who is it? A pro team? We'd be at a disadvantage if we played against pros. With any luck, we might even lose today. A round of applause for our host today! Dad, good luck! All right. Greet each other! Shake. Let's go! - Let's go! - Let's go! Look! Here they come! Damn it! You should've blocked him! Hyo-bong, what are you doing? Block him! Block that boy! Darn, this is all Hyo-bong's fault! What are you all doing? Does it hurt your pride to play against kids? Can't do it? Are you letting them win? Come on. They may be small and weak, but technique-wise, they're much better. Why don't you want to win? Go win, no matter what! You got that? Yeah, go take the win. You're already in a match. You gotta take the win! The second half is starting. Let's all get up. Huddle up. Let's cheer. Don't be so awkward. Put your hands together. On the count of three, "Let's win! We got this!" Okay? One, two, three! Let's win! Why isn't anyone doing it? - Come on! - Let's win! We got this! - Let's go! - Good. Well done. An impressive achievement. To your positions! - Hyo-bong, I'm watching you. - Do as you practiced. - Cheer up! - Let's go! - Good luck, Dad! - Let's go! Let's go! What? Why? Your acting's getting better. It's all about method acting. - Go! - Over here! Here! Big Issue, one point! In-sun! My man! Cross. Stop right there! My back. Why does he keep posting these? - Over here! Here! - Lob it! Big Issue, two points! Young-jin! Amazing! Sorry! Three points! Let's come from behind and beat them! Beom-su! Big Issue, four points! One more goal! Let's go! I found it on the way back. Premier League. It looks good on you. Hey, no. Stop. Don't do that here. Later, okay? EVERGREEN GOSIWON Beom-su! Here! Pass! Dad, let's go! Goal! Dad! Five to four. Big Issue wins! What? - I just had a wonderful dream. - What about it? The viewership for the documentary shot up. I ripped the graph off and slapped the boss with it. But I'm born with the fate that whenever I have a good dream, bad luck also comes with it. DIRECTOR HWANG - You see? - What? The sponsor pulling out means... Participating in this year's tournament may be tough. This was your idea. Yes, you're right. It was me. I'm making this film with my neck on the line. I risked my job to be out here! I'll make absolutely sure that next year... - Look! - Hey. How come weird stuff happens whenever I eat a popsicle? How much is required, and how much are we short? Are you saying we can't afford to go? It fell through? No, we just need money for flights and equipment... Just give me a number. Roughly, we need about 30 million won... How much do you have now? Be honest. Zero? Not zero. It's a negative balance. We're always in the negative. This whole thing was a scam? You got me involved when it wasn't even ready? - No... - Be quiet, please. You guys just scammed me! Scam? If this falls through, I'll be the one on the streets. It's not a scam! I'm about to commit murder! I don't care if you become homeless or kill someone. Why should I do this? Wait, I'll get a sponsorship for sure! - From where? - Forget it! Give it up! I can't! - Where will you get it? - It's a social organization. Which social organization? Korea Racing Association. I mean, FLC. Football Loving Club. It's a group... I'm usually fast, but those bitches brought their sprinter daughter. I used to be a sprinter in school, and I ran like hell, but she caught up, ran alongside, and grinned at me. This feels nice seeing you smile too. - Hong-dae, once we settle... - Mom. What's your number-one priority? What is your number one? What? Don't other moms put their children as number one? There are plenty of moms who put them in third or fourth place. Yeah? Thanks. I guess I was born to be in second place. Mom... I have no money. Just pay for your crimes here. How could you say that to your mom? I couldn't even afford to treat my cavities! Why are you doing this to me? Cavities? Really? You're my cavity! Did something happen to you? Something always happens! You're that something! Shit. It's about time we cut ties. COACH YOON, THANK YOU FOR LETTING US STAY AT YOUR PLACE, HYO-BONG What? What did you say? Isn't this a football jersey? Don't do it? What did you say? I pushed you on the swing! Lady, take this off. Take it off! You okay? Get up. It's me. Look at me! Get up! We should go. Bastards like him always pop up when I feel like doing bad stuff. Where did you come from? What a shitty day. This is your last chance to walk away. If you stay, I'll grind you up and drink you down. Let's get him a blender. He says he'll grind us up. Try it, asshole. You bastard! Son of a bitch! Bastard! Shit! Goddamn punk! In less than two months since assaulting a reporter, Yoon Hong-dae has been involved in another assault case. This time, he assaulted high school students while drunk. Surprisingly, none of them were poked in the eyes. As a professional football player, he kicked... Turn it off. Ho-rak... Dump him. SEOUL YEOUI POLICE STATION It's about Yoon Hong-dae. As you may already know... I don't know him well. Those teens were harassing a woman with a mental disability... - She can't talk. - She sometimes does! She really likes Yoon. Didn't Yoon get hit too? He apparently wasn't. How does he fight so well, then? Yoon Hong-dae did nothing wrong! What are you looking at? You know... Yoon Hong-dae... Is this Yoon Hong-dae? Why are you talking to my thing? It's about Yoon Hong-dae. He was... Because he's Yoon Hong-dae, he Yoon Hong-daed like a Yoon Hong-dae. Yoon Hong-dae? I'm looking for someone. Shit, I'm getting a headache. What is the matter with you people? How could you not investigate an assault case? The perp admitted to it. What's there to investigate? The witness can't talk, and there are no security cams either! Tell him to settle properly. - But Yoon Hong-dae... - Yoon Hong-dae! Yoon Hong-dae! Enough! - Okay. All right. - Stop. That Yoon Hong-dae... I've had it! As a producer, can't you show the world who Hong-dae really is? What? I'm not at that level yet. Gosh, that idiot. He talks about becoming a celebrity as if he doesn't care about football, and everyone thinks he doesn't practice. But he trained harder than anybody else I knew. They say hard work will trump talent, but it's not true at all. There are times when athletes just feel it. You run like hell, only to trail behind. You simply can't keep up, but it doesn't mean you're bad. Park Sung-chan Those who fall behind just need a helping hand. Football isn't played by just the guy in front. Jin-ju, it's So-min. Do you remember me? Hong-dae really needs help. - You remember him, right? - Headache. I told you. It's no use. What am I to you? That damn Yoon Hong-dae. That swing? Why did you want to swing after dark? That's where those teens harassed you? Yes. What is it? The sky? That apartment? There? Cell phone? Someone shot a video with a cell phone up there? AUGUST 14, 2010, A PLAYGROUND IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX A MAN DOES A FLYING KICK? THE EXPERT EYE POKER! THE FOOTBALLER YOON! HE'S BEEN LYING LOW AND REFLECTING ON HIS ACTIONS, SO WHY? CAUSING ANOTHER INCIDENT? I'll be joining you all from today. My name is Yoon Hong-dae. THIS TEAM IS REPRESENTING KOREA TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HOMELESS FOOTBALL WORLD CUP THEY ARE NOT FIGHTING SO UNEXPECTED? HE IS A NICE GUY? TO ALLOW HYO-BONG TO SPEND TIME WITH HIS DAUGHTER, YOON OFFERED HIS HOME JIN-JU, WHO HAS AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY, LOVES FOOTBALL HE GIFTED HER A FOOTBALL JERSEY! BACK TO AUGUST 14! A WOMAN WHO'S BEING HARASSED THIS WOMAN IN A JERSEY IS YOON HONG-DAE'S FRIEND! JIN-JU! YOON WANTED TO SAVE HER COULD HE REALLY BE THE ATTACKER? VIEWS LIKE, DISLIKE Get Ho-rak. I mean, escort him here. We withdrew the lawsuit. But if my boys are identified... The viral video from last week continues to heat up screens. Right, it's the one featuring footballer Yoon Hong-dae. He instantly became an action hero with this video alone. Is it true that he'll make a UFC debut? We welcome him with open arms. It'll be addictive. A so-called Yoon Hong-dae law has been proposed, calling for harsher punishment for those who assault people with disabilities, even if the assailants are minors. He turned his life around by beating people up. They're not people! He should've killed those punks. Hello. So-min, great work. - How did it go? - You and the director made this happen. So, how is it going? Here, look. We're slightly short, but our crowdfunding got a ton of interest after the video. We've surpassed five million won. We'll reach our goal soon! - Yay! - Yay! I'll contribute too. Maybe 50,000 won? - 30,000 won for me. - Round it up. Put up 50,000 won! - How much will you contribute? - What did you say? How much will you contribute? Where the heck is Hong-dae? Why did he go radio silent? How come he's not here? Well... The flophouse I'm at... Here. Eating beef, huh? Right off the bones. Now I get why people become hermits. It's so comfy. Hey! Law of the Jungle? Where you catch lizards and stuff in the jungle? Yeah, that. - Go to the jungle? - Yeah, jungle. The departure is a day before the World Cup, you know? Yeah, I do. Don't go there. - What? - What did I tell you? Those who work for low wages make great tearjerkers. She already gave us what we wanted. I'm grateful to her. But the World Cup prep is finally done. Homeless or Hobo Cup... That's no real World Cup. It's just a charity event. We have to keep up the momentum. Public opinion has no heart. You get that? Good or bad, everything fades away quickly! You'll be forgotten. But even so... Enough, asshole. Fine. I know you're a good guy. But don't be ridiculous. People who act all compassionate when they can't live like a saint sicken me. Hong-dae, let's live as bad guys. EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT I'll be good to you. Hey. How did the talk go with your agent? Who knows. Don't you want to thank me? Are you gloating? Want me to get you a cooking oil gift set? Make it a soap gift set. I ran out. All right. In-sun, pass it to me! All right, start running. Good timing, but look at the ball till the end. All right! Once more. Eyes on the ball. In-sun, run. Good, that's a lot better. One of them should've gone in by now, right? It's okay to fail. It's not okay, don't you think? In-sun, you're doing well. - Be a bit more confident. - Okay. Hyo-bong, good! You'd do better if you lost some weight. Dad, you're doing great! Moon-su, that's the spirit. But don't get depressed. Okay! Great defense. Just keep that up! Let's take a break. Okay, break time! We're so close now. Listen while you eat. I can't go to the World Cup with you. What do you mean? Coach, what do you mean by that? I have a bit of a situation. Me being there won't make much of a difference. Coach, why all of sudden... What will you be doing instead, then? Good question. Well... - I'm going to catch lizards. - Lizards? Anyway, let's train hard until the very end. Coach. Did we do something wrong? You should be the new coach. They all listen to you. Is it because they don't listen to you? Or because of him? We can kick him out. He's abandoning ship now that he's famous. I'm sure Coach Yoon has a plan. What plan? He doesn't plan. Yup, I don't. I joined this team without a plan. Wait... Coach, if you suddenly... What's with you? You're right. He's ditching us because he's famous now. Don't talk like that. He did his best to train you guys. I didn't learn anything. Just running. You couldn't even do that right. - What? - Stop pretending to be deaf! What? What is it? It's because of your mom, isn't it? Gosh, what an amazing son you are. You look fucking pathetic right now. You know that? Latching onto these people to use them is fucking pathetic too. You know that? Since we're both pathetic, let's stay away from each other. It's doubly pathetic. I want Ju-ri to trip on the rock here. Then Hong-dae could help her up. I love it. We'll eat the lizards. Reptile allergy, anyone? Not me! I'll eat it. I really like it. I'll eat it. I eat it with rice in green tea, like eating borigulbi. I'll eat. I can eat it raw. I'll one-up you, and I'll eat it alive. That doesn't make any sense. Eating it raw does? Eating it like borigulbi is total BS. Why does this food feel like an assault? I just wanted to show you. Hong-dae, thank you. I'll pay you back as soon as I can. How, exactly? I'm moving to Jeju Island with that friend of mine. Jeju Island? I wanted to start over in a place where no one knows me. Sure. That way, you can scam them. I really don't do that anymore. Hey, Hong-dae! Turn around! Yoon Hong-dae's first and last game as a youth national athlete. Turn it off. I don't wanna see it. Aren't you leaving? Come on. Let me watch a bit before I go. Good. Yeah, let's go. That's it. Here, right here. Go! Here! This is it! Shoot! Goal! I guess I'm growing old too. Sorry for not being there at the game. It's not like you attended my other games. Jeez, you brat. You always have to have the last word because you take after me. So handsome. Hong-dae. Are you sure you want to go to the jungle? I always finished second as a sprinter in school. I wanted to try harder, but I had you when I was 18. Is that my fault? You were a reckless teenager. Hey! That was because your dad... Sorry. Right. If you think about it, we're not like other moms and sons. Other sons turned out fine by listening to their moms. But you made it this far because you did the exact opposite. I just instinctively knew that I shouldn't listen to you. Yeah, go to the jungle. Screw football. What's so fun about running around and putting a ball in a net? Hey, don't do it. Be a celebrity. Since I cooked, I'll do the dishes. Life sucks. It's not so tough. If someone talks to you in English, respond loudly in Korean. Then they'll be flustered. And we can just walk away. What is he saying? You're going as a coach, so you can't play. I hear you. It feels empty somehow. I didn't realize how big a role the coach had. Not me. I miss him. Me too. But I also resent him. That cold-hearted punk left us, so I'll forget him with my cold heart. Have you been well? You look great. You're all dressed up. Did he dress up for the jungle? ANSWER MY CALLS, YOON HONG-DAE LET'S LIVE LIKE BAD GUYS He's the only one wearing a suit. Even his socks match his suit. Team Korea! Team Korea! - Team Korea! - Team Korea! - Team Korea! - Team Korea! - Team Korea! - Team Korea! Something's very wrong. Wasn't this a homeless tournament? Retreat. Should we head home? No need to be afraid. It's just a ball. It won't kill you. Three thousand ri Of splendid rivers and mountains Covered with mugunghwa blossoms Great Korean people Stay true To the great Korean way! All right. - Very well. Let's huddle up! - Let's do it! - All right. One, two, three. - Korea, let's go! - You can do this! - Let's go! - Let's go! - Be confident! You should've blocked him before he got to me! What the heck are you doing? - Go shoot from there. - Hyo-bong! Get the hell up! Why did you let him steal it? Are you kidding me! Block it! Coach, Hyo-bong looks injured. - Change. - Hyo-bong! - Hyo-bong! - Come on out. Get over here! Hyo-bong, you did good! - My back. Good luck. - Are you all right? Beom-su, the right side! Block him! Block! It's a tight match at six to zero. The other team's starting to get nervous. They'll be too scared to play. Very well. There is one conclusion. They're stronger than we thought. And? - That's it. - That's all? Hey! "Stronger than we thought"? I should've been the coach if that's all you got! You should. I never said you can't. You could've just called from Korea! You never said they were that good! You little... It's your job to know that! You're the head coach! - "You little"? - Yes, you heard me! - Did she just... - Let go. - Hey, are you done talking? - No! Let go of me! I think homeless people from other countries get free meat from their government. How many points have they scored? You did good! Twelve to nothing. What the hell? Don't be discouraged. Losing was part of the plan. It all went according to plan. That's right. Mission accomplished. - See that? We lost twelve to zero. - It's okay. Throw that out. Why are you digging through the trash? All right. I think we can go now. Has anyone seen In-sun? There's always someone in the group who disappears. Hey! What is going on here? I'm really sorry. He's had a rough life. We're sorry. Snap out of it! Who hit you? Tell me! Stop. You're hitting him right now. Which bastard was it? Was it him? Asshole, what the hell did your parents teach you? He's not part of our team. He's some idiot passing by. Do you know who I am?! Out of the way! "Idiot"? Let go of me! There are ten games left. Most are European teams. How could they not even score one goal? You picked them based on their backstories. Did I expect them to win the World Cup? I'm asking for one win. What's the point of filming all the losses? Sorry, this is our first time... Hey, Coach! Put together a strategy! A strategy is only for a team that is capable of it. Admiral Yi fought off 330 invading ships with just 12 of his own. That's so random, you know that? Yeah. Christ! Just one win. I'm not even asking for two. Please. Why don't you play? The rule states that female athletes are allowed... Honestly, I want a win too. Even if we don't win, we might get a tie if we don't give up. Then we might even get a win. I just don't want them to fear stepping on the field. I mean, we came all the way here, so if we achieve even just that much... It's all right. It's not your fault. He got injured while dancing. Whose fault is it, then? It's your fault. But even if he's out, it won't make much of a difference. - You bastard. - We don't have any reserve players. We have two games today. You idiot. Teams without reserve players are allowed to use two foreign players. But they're Brazilians. - Brazilians? - Yeah. If we keep rotating them in, we could get a tie. You're the coach now. Wait... Everyone's doing well! In-sun! To the side! Go! We're winning! So, how does it look? The losers winning the game? We can sub one at a time! Stop him! Block! Change. Let's go! Come in. You did great! Good, very good. - Good job. - Nice pass. Are you hurt? Do we lose if we don't score a single goal? - We can score next time. - I mean, we won. What's going on? Let's all head back. Didn't we win? - It's fine. - Good job! But we won! Next up is Germany. They're the favorites to win. You saw them play yesterday. Their opponent passed out after getting hit. This is a tough call. If we use just our players, I don't think we'll finish the tournament. If winning is important, we have to use the Brazilians. But did anyone come here to win? If we win, the numbers will be recorded, like one win or two wins and final scores. But what good are those numbers? Will you negotiate salaries with those records? Are you here for records or memories? I'll leave that to the players to decide. Did you write that for him? I want to try. I want to try to win. Good. I'll steal the ball at all costs, and In-sun, I'll pass it to you. Cross. Let's do it ourselves! Hey! I can play! Let's do it! I'll block everything. Got it? Let's just go for it! We can totally beat those frail bastards. German Tank Corps? Whatever. We've got nothing to lose! That's nothing to brag about, you idiot. Why are you always up my ass? Shall we get going? - Awesome! - Let's do this! - Let's go! - Let's go! - Come on! - Let's go! Go! Look at this, Kim In-sun. Look properly, kid. You kicked the ball, but it didn't work out. Then what did you do? Take a look. It's okay if it doesn't go in! But what about the ball after it bounced off? Go after it and score a goal. That's called a rebound. Those who dominate rebounds dominate the game. "Dominate." You all practiced this. Don't be intimidated. Take the first shot, okay? - Okay! - Okay! Okay. I won't tell you to get back up when you trip! If you fall, just trip and bring them down with you. That's how it's done! Let's go! Stop him! Nice! Shoot! - Young-jin, good! - Good job! Block him! They cheated! Stop him! - Moon-su. - Hey, are you all right? - It's okay! - You okay? - Get back up. It's okay! - You did well! You're dead! I'll kill you all! Trip him if you fall! That jerk stepped on his foot! Defense! - That's it! Just like that! - Well done! - Get some shots from above. - Okay. Hey, it's okay. You're doing great. This is awesome! Moon-su, awesome! Did you see that? Their eyes. Defense! Move in! Go, In-sun! Over here! He has to be subbed out. He can't run the entire game. You're very persistent. Fine, go. Hyo-bong, get in here! - Good job. - Good luck! Beom-su! Come on! You got this! That's it! Very good! - Nice! - I tripped him! Good! Good work! What did you say? What? Are you all right? I mean, I put the pressure on for a win, but we have to get through our remaining games. You don't have to play like this, okay? Yeah, you played really well. - You already did your best. - Yes. Coach, let's use the subs. - Then... - Kyung-jin is watching. I don't want to be switched out. I have to show my little girl too. That her daddy can do this. I have to make sure a certain someone has a warm bed. And she likes football. I used to be a thug. I beat up people and ruined my family. From now on, I'll only kick balls, so come at me! I'm gay. Yeah, well, I like guys. - Yes! - My shoulder blade! My father fainted from the shock and never got back up. I was scared and felt so bad, so I wasted my life away. But I'm not the problem. The world that thinks it's a problem is to blame. No? - Don't laugh. - So cool. So I guess everyone has a reason to play. That's right! We're the national athletes! Why use Brazilian subs? - Let's go! - Go! - Let's go! - Let's go! Moon-su, you should rest up. I'm really okay! You little shit! Damn it! You were amazing. That was your best play to date. Coach. Let me play. Hwan-dong, you can't. I'm really okay. It's all healed. Look at it. I can, at the very least, be the goalkeeper. I can do this. Goalkeepers don't just stand around. It's the hardest position. We have to do something. Let's give it a try! Gather around. - Okay! - Come on, huddle up. My shoulder. It's been tough, and that'll continue when we return to the field, perhaps even more so. However, we must let them know why we want to be out there. Let them know that we can play! That we are here! Let's show them that! Let's show them! There's no reward for winning. Your body will just take a beating. Are you okay with that? We're okay with that! Even if you can barely walk, I won't sub you out, okay? We're okay with that! - Hands together! - Go! All right. One, two, three! Korea, let's go! Let's go! You can do this! Yeah! Go! Let's go! Let's go! It's all right! It's okay! We got this! In-sun, come back in! You got this! You did well. Let's go! Block him! - Hwan-dong! - Yeah? I'm fine! In-sun! Come here. Be confident, and keep your eyes on the ball. Even if you try and fail, you can't do worse than the ball. This is from Yumi. Referee! Beom-su, come on out! You got this! In-sun, you got this! You can do it! Show us what you got! Go for it! He doesn't have to go that far. You can do it! Hwan-dong, let's go! - We can do this! - We can! - We can do this! - We can do this! Cramps! Are you okay? - No, that's not it! - Just a cramp. It's okay. Beom-su, come on out! Wipe the floor with them! - You got this! - You can do it! Are you really okay? Stop it. You'll die! Young-jin, get over here! No! I'm fine! I'm perfectly fine! Team Korea! Team Korea! Team Korea! Team Korea! Team Korea! Team Korea! Team Korea! Team Korea! Team Korea! Team Korea! Team Korea! The final play! Beom-su! In-sun, run! In-sun! Shoot! Team Korea! Team Korea! Good job! Not the ball. The athlete!
