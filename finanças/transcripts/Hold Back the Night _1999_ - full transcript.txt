[MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [RATTLING] [RATTLING] [FOOTSTEPS] [BED CREAKS] [DOOR CLOSES] [MUSIC PLAYING - GRAND THEFT AUDIO, "THE LIGHT OF DAY"] Charlene, what are you doing? Charlene! Charlene, come back, please. At least wait until the morning. Come back and we'll talk about it! I don't want to fucking talk about it! Well, where will you go? What do you care? What about Jackie? She'll miss you. You fucking bastard. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BACKGROUND TALKING] [WHISTLE] MAN: Fancy a lift, love? Piss off. MAN: Come on, have a drive around, have a bit of fun. Piss off, will you? MAN: Come on, there's 20 quid in it for you if you fancy it. Fucking please yourself then. [DOGS BARKING] [SHOUTING] [MUSIC - SARAH JAY HAWLEY, "WON'T BE THE SAME"] (Singing) Did I see something never seen? Did you turn off the light? I'm still a child and I can't breathe. And I'm stuck in between. Where I have been. Will I ever really know? I won't be the same. Night goes on and on and on. And what am I supposed to buy with that? Hey, love. Got any money to spare us? JOHN: By the way, I'm away next week. DECLAN: What about the fucking bypass? JOHN: It's all over. I'm grappling with demons, I feel like I'm wrestling with the devil. Just need to spend some time alone for a while, know what I mean? DECLAN: What the fuck are you talking about? Too many maggot farms in the psychic landscape. What the fuck are you two going on about? Don't have to tell us, just a pull of that joint, hey? Thanks. Don't let me slow you down. Doesn't matter. I have to purge myself of the detritus. Hey? He mean means rubbish. I'm Declan. He's Irish Johnny. Do you know me brother, rubber? DECLAN: You? I'm Charlene. JOHN: How are you, Charlene? [DOOR CREAKS] [DOG CRIES] CHARLENE: What's this about maggots then? JOHN: It's to do with the sanctity of the brain. Stay there, I'll kick your ass. JOHN: Do you know what I mean? [DOG CRIES] You see, thoughts insinuate themselves onto our minds all the time without stopping. And we very rarely consider them. So what? I want to be able to observe a thought, and then act upon it without it acting upon me. CHARLENE: How? JOHN: I'm going away, into the country for a retreat. Catholic. Fuck no! There's no hierarchies. I'm going to meditate. Hey, scubby. Get your hands off my dog. The dog's collar's too tight. It's choking him. I'll fucking choke you if you're not careful. Oh, yeah? You and what fucking army? Right you, out! I'm not going yet, I haven't finished me fucking drink! I said, out! Do you want to fucking go? [SHOUTING] DECLAN: This way! Put the helmet on. [DOG BARKS] Come here, come here. Right, take him. What do you want me to do with it? Hold him tight. [SHOUTING] That's my dog! [MUSIC PLAYING] What is this place? Road protest camp. This is the camp on the site for the [INAUDIBLE] bypass. Oh, you're a hippie then? If you say so. What did you bring the dog for? The guy [INAUDIBLE] kicking him if we left him behind. Protesting about a road, why bother? Why bother? [BABY CRIES] What about the pollution? I mean, in 10 years time it won't be safe to breathe. And what about all the kids with asthma, all that poison in the air? Ha! You've got a motorbike, hey? Yeah, well, I need my bike. But they're cutting down the countryside and destroying all the trees. So what? So what? Look at that tree, been there for like 200 years. Trees make oxygen. If you cut down all the trees, then the planet will suffocate. Yeah, well, a bunch of hippies ain't going to stop 'em. Maybe not. But I mean, people think that building roads is a bad idea. 10 years ago they didn't give a toss. We can change people's minds. You reckon, hey? Yeah, here. This is your home for the night. What the fuck's that? You don't have to stay. Yeah, I'll stay. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Can't see a fucking thing. DECLAN: Hang on a minute. OK. CHARLENE: I wonder what happened to Irish John. He'll be OK. He's a survivor. What's this? That's a didgeridoo. A what? A didgeridoo, a musical instrument from Australia. Oh, you are a hippie. Whatever. What do you do with it? You blow down it. Oh, do it then. OK. What'd you think? Fucking racket. So, what about you? How'd you mean? Well, where are you from? Nowhere. Where were you last night? Somewhere else, all right? So what now? Get into bed and shag each other. What? Just like that? That's what you want, isn't it? DECLAN: Is that what you want? Yeah. Shouldn't we get to know each other first? What for? I don't know. All right, then. Do you want to have a joint first? Let's have it in bed. I'm cold. You're brilliant. Don't do that! DECLAN: What? Don't like people pulling my hair. It's all right, just don't touch my hair. Come on, enjoy it. Oh! Fucking dog, get rid of it! [DOG CRIES] [RUMBLING] What the fuck do you think you're doing? I was just looking-- Well, don't! Look, I'm sorry if you-- Don't paw me, I'm not your fucking dog! You didn't mind last night. That were then. No one's forcing you to stay. All right. I'm going. You're leaving? Edinburgh, to visit my uncle. [WHISTLES] What the fuck? They're attacking the camp. What? DECLAN: Get your stuff! [SHOUTING] [BANGING] Get the fuck out the tent! CHARLENE: What's going on? Come on, let's go! Fuck off and leave us alone! Get a life and leave us alone! Stop! Stop! Get off, you fucking mutt. Get the fuck off me! DECLAN: Sorry! What you doing? JOHN: This is a non-violent protest! [SCREAMING] Get the fuck off him! Fucking do something, will you? Shit. - You [INAUDIBLE] Shit! DECLAN: Come on! [MUSIC PLAYING] Where are you? DECLAN: Get down. OFFICER (RADIO): Give us a description, Gary. One girl, one boy, both white, late teens, early 20s. He's got one of them stupid bloody haircuts, what do you call? Dreadlocks. She's got blonde, shoulder-length hair, about 5 foot 4, 5 foot 5. He's got green cargo pants on. Is he coming back? Ssh. [FOOTSTEPS] I've lost sight of them. Get a car on the other side. OFFICER (RADIO): Roger, will do. Shit. Do you think I killed that man? I just wanted him to stop hitting you. [RUSTLING] Oh, the fucking dog! (WHISPERS) Come on! Come on. Come here. [POLICE SIREN] Bit of a flap on, Constable? Sergeant. You alone, madam? Well you're here. SERGEANT: What's in the back? Oh, bits and pieces. Oh, uh, sit, Cerberus, sit. He should be muzzled. What's all this about then? I mean, surely you are not stopping people to ask them about their pets. SERGEANT: No, madam. We're looking for two young people, a lad and a girl, road protesters, unkempt, both in need of a wash. You're after them because they're dirty? They're dangerous, madam. Don't give any lifts to strangers. Oh, I'm all right. I've got Cerberus. Yes, well, if you do see them, ring the police. Of course, officer. Law and order, I understand. I was in the army, you know. All right, you can come out now. Sorry. Well, you damn well should be. Is that all of you? Yeah. Would you like us to get out now? Oh god, no. I'm not going to stop now. You keep taking a chance. Well, chance is a fine thing, as they say. Well, he said we were dangerous. Oh, you don't look like murderers to me. No, no, we haven't done anything. We were trying to save the trees, weren't we? Do you realise this planet could suffocate? VERA: Vera. Sorry, what was that? That's my name, Vera. What's yours? I'm Declan. (WHISPERS) Don't fucking tell her. And this is Charlene. (WHISPERS) Fucking great. (WHISPERS) Shit the fuck up, will you? Where are you heading? CHARLENE: Uh, Scotland, Edinburgh. Oh, you're in luck. I'm going north. Oh yes, where? Brodga. CHARLENE: Where is that? As far as I can get. Do either of you drive? DECLAN: Yes, I can drive. Good. [THUNDER] CHARLENE: She's a fucking man. Look at her. And we'd be in the shit without her. I bet you she's a dyke. Hm, takes one to know one. Fuck off! Bollocks. She said she were in the army. A lot of dykes in the army. Maybe we should get out there and give her a hand. Just roll the fucking joint first, will you? Fuck off, will you? You got any fucking decent jokes? You want to mellow out for a bit? I don't want to fucking mellow out. Stuck in the middle of nowhere in the fucking rain with that bloody dog. Well, it's not that bad, considering our circumstances. Yeah, well, it's me they're after. If I were you I'd piss off. And do what? I don't give a toss. Find some fucking trees to look after instead of me. And what will you do? Stay at me Uncle. What's he like? Don't know. There was a family argument, he's not been in touch for years. Mum used to go and see him, but she's dead now. What about you? DECLAN: What about me? Your family, what are they like? I haven't got one. Everybody's got a family. Well, I haven't. Oh, Oh. It's wet out here! Ah, sorry about the [INAUDIBLE].. Oh, strip off and run around in the rain. That will freshen you up. Come on, out you go. Out there? It's pissing down. Can't we sleep in here? With me? Come on. You're young, you'll be fine. We're not sleeping with the dog. But he can come in with me, all right? Well, what if we wanted to wee? Well, find a bush. Come on, Charlene. [LAUGHS] Can I take this with me? No, no, not that one. Um, I left a quilt in the tent. Good luck! [SHOUTING] Fucking hell! [MUSIC PLAYING] Hold me. What time is it? Just hold me, please. How's that? Better. Don't kiss me! Please, I just want to be held. All right. Like that? Yeah. [PHONE DIALING TONE] [PHONE RINGING] CHARLENE: Jackie, is that you? Charlene, it's me. Where are you? Let me speak to Jackie. MICHAEL: She's busy. Look, tell me where you are, and me and Jackie will come and pick you up. You keep your hands off her. Why don't you come home? We'll talk about it. I can't do that. MICHAEL: Well, in that case I can't let you speak to Jackie. Bastard! Well, look, the fuel system is all plugged up. Well, it can be fixed, can't it? Not by me. I've got family to visit! Well, there's a garage somewhere. Can't you be able to find a garage, like this isn't the fucking countryside. Thank you for your concern, Charlene. Vera helped us, remember? To escape from the [INAUDIBLE],, who could arrive at any fucking minute. Ah, you fucking stay then! I don't care! What about the dog? CHARLENE: Oh, for fuck's sake! Well, he helped us. You're soft, you are! DECLAN: Maybe. I'll take him. He can look after me on my journey. Are you coming, or what? Thanks for the grub and stuff, Vera. Ah, fucking hurry up. I hope you get to where you're going. Good luck. Off you go. DECLAN: Bye. Yeah, that's him. I'll do it, give us the money. Hi, sweetness. What's happening? 20 quid [INAUDIBLE]. No, have you got nothing for a tenner? [INAUDIBLE] 20 quid a buy. No, I've got a tenner, and that's it. DEALER: Fuck yourself. CHARLENE: Fuck yourself, man. Split us a bag. DEALER: You can't expect [INAUDIBLE] Oh, come on, man. Fucking stop the attitude, will you? - Fuck off! - Oh, for fuck's sake! I got 20 pound bags [INAUDIBLE] with it, come on. Ah, fuck! Who the fuck's this, by the way? DECLAN: Is there a problem? No, no fucking problem! There is a fucking problem, isn't it? We've got 20 fucking quid between us, sort us out. Yes, here-- [SCREAMS] I gave you your fucking money! Quick, get underneath the van. No fucking way! Get underneath the van! Thought I saw the fuckers go up there. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] us, fuckers! Come on! DECLAN: We don't have to take it all at once. I want to. Well, we could save some for later. Ah! Fucking hell! It's not fucking speed! Let me see. Fuck! It's just glucose. Fucking bastard ripped us off! You reckon? Fucking taking it back. You're going to find it really hard to score again in this city. So fucking what? Well, you want to live here with your uncle. I expect so. You mean he doesn't know that you're coming? No. Shit. I wonder which one he lives in. I don't think I could live in Edinburgh again. You don't have to. You can go where you like. Wouldn't it be great to have as many drugs as you wanted all the time? Yeah. If all of your dreams come true, what would you really like? I want a piece of land in the hills. I wish I had my bike. I could get to the hills now. Have you got any brothers or sisters? No. How about you? Yeah. I got two sisters. They're both brain damaged at birth. Carol Lou died and Jackie [INAUDIBLE].. Why'd you say that? CHARLENE: She's got a mental age of eight. She lives with me dad. Do you miss her? Of course I fucking do! Don't you miss your family, summat? No. What about your mum? Fucked off when I was wee. CHARLENE: Your dad brought you up? Yeah, we argued all the time. What about? Animal rights mostly. He was a chicken farmer, that's why I left. You fucked off 'cause you didn't like chickens? You ever seen a battery chicken farm? It's like a fucking concentration camp, the noise, the stench. It's fucking unbelievable. Yeah? I had to feed the wee fuckers. Tell you something? What? I fucking hate eggs. All right, we better go. OK, then I'll-- I'll see you later. Aren't you coming with me? Well, well, will he be OK about taking the two of us? Find out. OK then. I hope he's got some grub. I'm starving. Get him to do you a nice fried egg sandwich. Mm, that would be nice. Give us some? - Fuck off. Come on. [SHOUTING] [BABY CRYING] [KNOCKING] Uncle Bob, remember me? Charlene. Charlene? You're one of Cathy's babies. Yeah! Well, this is a surprise. You best come in then. Oh, uh, this is Declan. He's a friend. Hello, Uncle Bob. Oh, haven't you come then? Go through-- Make yourselves comfortable. I'll put the kettle on, hey? Jesus Christ. Fucking barbaric. Don't start, we've only just got here. Lots of birds, Uncle Bob! Yeah. They're my friends. I'm new to the area. DECLAN: Bastard. Shut up, will you? You can fuck off if you don't like it. It's me you're after. UNCLE BOB: Tea all right for you? Yeah, great! They're always like this with new people. They'll calm down in a minute. Well, they're wild birds. They should be in the wild. UNCLE BOB: Well, they'd never survive. They were bred for captivity. Sugar? Yeah, three for me and none for him. Anyway, you shouldn't call me uncle. What? UNCLE BOB: Granddad. I'm your granddad. Granddad? Yeah, on your mother's side. I'm her father. Did you hear that, Dec? Yeah. Bob's not your uncle. Fuck you. But my mum, she always called you uncle. Oh no. I'm her dad. Well, I was her dad. So do I not get a kiss from my granddaughter? That's better! You've been wanting to stay over? Oh, yeah, please? Well, you can sleep in my bed. I'll keep down in here and he can sleep in the living room. Declan, is it? Thanks. Uh, could I have a bath? Can my granddaughter have a bath? Course you can. I'll run it for you. Hurry up with that, will you? Oh, you can fucking go anytime. I keep telling you. You're staying then? Course I'm fucking staying. He's me granddad. Where else am I going to go? Just a few stupid birds. Oh, yeah, just a few stupid birds, finches, tits, wild birds, kept in captivity. It doesn't really matter, does it? CHARLENE: [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE],, fuck off, will you? Fucking give it to me! DECLAN: Fuck off! Give me the fucking drag, now! Stupid bastard! Get in here! [SPLASHING] [LAUGHING] [KNOCKING] UNCLE BOB: Charlene, what's going on? Uh, it's OK, granddad. I slipped in the bath. I'm OK! Are you both in there? CHARLENE: Well, we thought it would save on your hot water, granddad. Be out in a minute! [LAUGHING] [SPLASHING] Are you hungry? I've got some eggs. [LAUGHTER] (WHISPERING) Do you understand me? [INAUDIBLE] Hey, you better with the fish and the gherkins! Don't forget the gherkins! Where the hell is he? It's been hours. Well, he's got a 20 pound note in his pocket. You might never see him again. CHARLENE: I'm hungry. I'll whistle you something up in a minute. Now, who do you think that is? It's my mum. She looks like me, don't she? That's just what I was thinking. Now look at this. Why did my mum say you were my uncle? Your mum and I were very close. But there was a falling out. What about? Michael. My dad? He ruined everything. Your mom and I never had a cross word between us. But he was-- he was jealous of her affection for me. When she died, he didn't even tell me until after the funeral. He's a twat. I can't go back there. Don't worry, you can stay here. Would that be OK? You can stay as long as you like. And what about Jaclyn? Jackie. I had to leave her. What else could I do? I'd love to have you both up here with me, and my family around me again. That'd be great. But how? There might be a way. I love you, you know? Look at this. What is it? Cathy's. My mum's. It reminds me of a [INAUDIBLE].. Feel it. No. Do it, come on. No, I can't. I can't touch it. [KNOCKING] - There he is. I'm starving. And where the fuck have you been? [INAUDIBLE] And I bet you forgot me gherkins. No, I didn't. [EXHALES] No, Charlene. It's a dream. [WHISPERING] [SCREAMING] Get off me! Fucking [INAUDIBLE]! No! UNCLE BOB: Charlene-- please, Charlene. No, just listen. Fuck off! I just want to talk to you alone. [SCREAMING] [INAUDIBLE] You fucking pervert! Just leave her. I just want to talk to her. DECLAN: Come on. She's my family. Leave her. She belongs to me. She stays-- [SCREAMING] UNCLE BOB: No! No! [INAUDIBLE] fucking bastard! No, no, don't do that! Don't open it! No, don't! Leave her! She's mine. You know nothing about it! She'll not stay with you anyway! She [INAUDIBLE] to me! DECLAN: Take this! UNCLE BOB: She's mine! She'll never belong to you! [CRYING] Here, put your trousers on, come on. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Yeah, baby, he's gone. It's all right now. He's gone. He's gone. Look, we need to hurry. Come on, for Christ's sake. Nowhere to fucking go. We can make for the bridge, over the fourth. It's the only way she can go. We might catch her. - Who? Vera. And if we don't? Well, we can hitch a ride. Look, have you got a better idea? Come on, then. [HOOTING] DECLAN: Hi, Vera! Well, I didn't expect to see you two! I thought we missed you. How lovely! I'll move that for you. Right. Thank you. Come on, doggy, come. Off we go! Oh, oh, hello puppy, hello. VERA: Did you have a lovely time at your uncle's? Huh? Is everything all right? Yes. [MUSIC - SARAH JAY HAWLEY, "URGE TO BREATHE"] (SINGING) I, I just want to watch you. Sleep where no one can follow. Any day now I think I'm gonna lose the urge to breathe. Don't know how I even got here. But I'm running out of road. Well is it worth all the trouble and it just gets worse. What kind of love can you give me? Here it's always sundown. I get so tired of counting stars. Any day now I'm gonna see it as it really is. Don't know how you even stay here. But I'm running out of road. Running out of road. Running out of time. I think I've had enough. Running out of road. Running out of time. I think I've had enough. Running out of road. Running out of time. [WATER GURGLING] This is just brilliant! Hey, Charlene? Fucking great being fucking eaten alive. DECLAN: It's beautiful! VERA: Yes, this is a good spot. Nice and flat. Right, clear the ground. CHARLENE: Probably get done for trespassing. No such thing in Scotland. You can camp where you like, as long as you don't make a mess. DECLAN: Yeah, I heard that. VERA: Civilized people, the Scots, unlike the English. CHARLENE: What's that supposed to fucking mean? Nothing. Oh, you mean Declan's all right, but I'm full of shit. Is that it, hey? I'm English, Charlene. You're fucking weird though, aren't you? Stop it, Charlene. Lonely, fucked up dyke, so desperate for fucking company that she has to pick up two losers like us, hey? Is that it? Something like that. You bastard. That's right, I know. What's up with you? Take your scruffy paws off me! VERA: Declan. Come and help me with the tent. I'm sorry, Vera. Hm. Why should you be? This a beautiful place, hey? [MUSIC - GRAND THEFT AUDIO, "SLEEP TONIGHT"] (SINGING) A hopeless hunger walks with me. Make it better, soothe away. A hopeless hunger walks with me. Make it better, soothe away. I'm sorry, Jackie! [MUSIC - GRAND THEFT AUTO, "SLEEP TONIGHT"] (SINGING) Sleep tonight. Sleep tonight. Sleep tonight. Sleep tonight. MICHAEL: Charlene, Come on. I've got a present for you. Come on, come sit on daddy's lap. Come on. Daddy's best girl. DECLAN: Is she going to be all right? Put your lips on me again, I'll fucking glass you. Yes, I think she's going to be fine. [COUGHING] You warm enough, Charlene? Stop fucking staring at me, will you? I thought you would feel better if you talked about it. Oh, did you? Don't you want to talk about it, Charlene? CHARLENE: Talk about fucking what? VERA: Whatever it is that's making you so unhappy. DECLAN: I know what happened. CHARLENE: [INAUDIBLE] fuck. I was there. VERA: What a beautiful night. The sky here is so big. Look at all those stars. I'm cursed. DECLAN: Don't say that. Why do you think you're cursed, Charlene? Four years ago, when mom went and topped herself, she found out that my dad had been abusing me and my sister since I was so fucking young that I can't remember. You weren't there then, were you, hey? And it didn't stop neither. It just carried on like before. Couldn't you tell someone? He said no one would believe me. He was my dad. I loved him. And even if I had told on him, Jackie would have just ended up in care. They wouldn't let me look after her, would they? He stopped doing it to me a couple years back. He swore blind he'd stop doing it to Jackie. But last week I found out she were on the pill. DECLAN: Jesus Christ. CHARLENE: I couldn't take anymore. So I ran away. VERA: I see. My mum went and topped herself. My dad, he's still screwing with my own fucking sister. You can't do anything about it because you can't go to the fucking police, can I? Why not? DECLAN: None of it is your fault. You don't fucking understand! No one fucking does! I can try. See, and I've just fucking told you and I don't feel any fucking better. VERA: Well, you may later. Why don't you sleep in the camper van tonight? What about you? Oh, it's a lovely night. I'd like to sleep outside. I'm keeping the lights on. No, no, no, I'm not going to waste the battery. But I'll build up a lovely fire. All right? Morning, Vera. Oh, good morning. Where's Charlene? She went for a walk. [INAUDIBLE] Up there, somewhere. Should we go and look for her? Well, you can, if you like. There's some field glasses in the van. What if she's going to try again? She won't. She took Killer with her. She doesn't even like Killer. Come on, Killer! [SCREAM] Fuck! Birds! It's all right, Killer. Come on, boy. Come on, you bastard. Charlene! What brings you up here? You. Is that OK? Think I'm going to throw myself off? DECLAN: Are you? Not today. Sorry about last night. Why? It's not your fault. I couldn't help you. I don't want you feeling sorry for me, Dec. I don't. I do like you, Charlene. I know. Last one down's a wanker! [MUSIC - HEATHER SMALL, "AFRAID"] (SINGING) The world is turning, ever changing. Every turn keeps hope alive. No matter what tomorrow brings, we can't hold back the hands of time. Too many days I've been afraid. Too many nights when alone I laid. Human and full of frailty. But the world is fine and belongs to me. I'm not afraid. Afraid. Oh, it's [INAUDIBLE]. It's great. I wish I could cool off. Why don't you jump in the river? Well-- What? Sorry, maybe you don't want to get back in the stream after-- After last night, you mean. You reckon, do you? Do you think I'm scared or something? No. Woo-hoo! Take your clothes off then. All right. Oh, it's lovely. Oh, fuck. Oh! Oh, it's fucking freezing! That's all right. It's lovely. [SCREAMING] You fucking bastard! Oh, it's lovely! Brilliant! Hey, we could have it off, like in the films. Um, it's a bit cold. Ah, let's try then. Seriously, it's a wee bit [INAUDIBLE].. What's wrong with it? It's fucking freezing! Ah, can't you make it grow? Not at all. No way! I should of gotten in a shower then it might grow. Yes. Oh, what's that? What? Oh you've got fucking leeches on your willy! Why are you fucking laughing? It's fucking hilarious! I [INAUDIBLE] over you as well. What? Well, they don't know the difference between your bits or mine. [SCREAMING] Oh fuck. Come here! Fucking come here! Get back in there, will you? [MUSIC - HEATHER SMALL, "AFRAID"] (SINGING) Know that the world is turning. And we're running to keep up with the pace. The body and heart still learning. There are problems I know I still have to face. I'm not afraid. Look, I can't fucking go if you're all looking at me! [MUSIC - HEATHER SMALL, "AFRAID"] (SINGING) Know that the sky is broken. And my shoulders can hardly take the weight. The spirit and soul still hoping to believe there is something more than fate. The world is turning, ever changing. Every turn keeps hope alive. No matter what tomorrow brings, we can't hold back the hands of time. Too many days I've been afraid. Too many nights when alone I laid. Human and full of frailty. But the world is mine and belongs to me. I'm not afraid. Afraid. It'll never work. Just wait and see. See, I told you it would work. Don't stop! Please, excuse me. VERA: Oh, did you want something? Go on. We can wait. No, carry on. Can you help us? I'm not sure where we are. Well, let's have a look. Come here. We're walking to Kintail from Glen Affric. Oh, you can't possibly take that path tonight. We'll find somewhere nearby to sleep. Under the sky. Have you got any blow? You know, dope, wacky baccy, marijuana? Hash? Yes, we have. Oh, they could stay, Vera. Share our fire if you like. JACOB: Is that OK? VERA: It's OK by me. JACOB: What do you say? Yes, fine. So, what are your names again? Well this is Torsten, and I'm Jacob. Jacob? What sort of name's that? A normal one in Denmark. You're a long way from home. We come for the fruit picking, and now we walk. There's nothing like this in Denmark. Do you want? No, she don't. Just a minute, just a minute, tonight she does. Hand it over. Thank you. Nothing at all. You need to work at it, Vera. Right. Oh yes, it's very nice. [MUSIC - GRAND THEFT AUDIO, "TO BE WITH YOU"] (SINGING) Let me take you-- Please play for us. Go on, Dec. Ah, roll another, hey. [INAUDIBLE] your stash, Torsten. [GASPING] [MOANING] What's the matter? Nothing. Knackered, that's all. I don't do impressions, Charlene. What's that supposed to mean? I like you, you know? I know. But I don't want to sleep with you tonight, Dec. You know? All right. If you get lonely, you know where I am. [MUSIC - GRAND THEFT AUDIO, "TO BE WITH YOU"] (SINGING) Show me how to be with you, to be with me. Here with you. Oh, my God. Charlene, where's Declan? How should I know? JACOB: He's gone. Where? He saw Charlene and Torsten together. VERA: Damn it all, Charlene! Hey, it's naught to do with you. Declan don't know me. VERA: Oh, to hell with all that! Declan can drive. So what? I have to get to a doctor. I'm not very well. Hey? VERA: Oh, oh God. You know, I drive truck. Oh, Jacob. Oh god. What's wrong with you, Vera? VERA: You get me to a doctor, quick! Oh, god. [MOANING] Killer! Come on, boy! Piss off, will you? Fucking move, now. And you're pissed? You want some? Vera's ill, she needs a doctor! DECLAN: So? So? So [INAUDIBLE], she's in pain. Why do you get Torsten, fucking donkey bollocks, to sort that out for you? Shit! The [INAUDIBLE] are here, now come on! DECLAN: I don't care. Vera's ill, she needs help! TORSTEN: Hurry up! She's very bad. I'm not going with him. Torsten is sorry. You will be. You spend your fucking time freeing fucking animals, yet you want me under lock and key, like an old fucking man. You're the expert in old men, aren't you? Fucking bastard! Oi you, stay there! Hurry up, Vera's very sick! Come on! I didn't know Charlene-- Come on, come on, come on, come on. Vera takes long. She looked pretty bad. What will you do? Don't know, depends on how bad Vera is. Maybe you go home? No. What about you? Today we walk to the sea, hey? And then? I don't know, there's a lot of places in the world. I have a sister in Australia. Let's go, Torsten. See you. Good bye. I'm sorry. CHARLENE: Nothing to be sorry for. Now, if the pain gets too much, just double the dose. Right. And you've got that number for the doctor? Yes, yes. Well, Vera, it's been a pleasure to have met you. Good luck. How are you? I'm much better. Thank you so much, doctor. Take care of her. She needs a lot of looking after. OK. Where's the camper van? We had to park in the hotel parking lot. Right, well that's where we're staying tonight, in the hotel. My treat. Fucking hate bedrooms. Fucking hate double beds. Going to roll a joint? No. Fucking misery. What did you expect? Can't stand clinging around. Clingy? Jesus Christ. Am I clingy? One kiss and they think they own you. How would you feel if I went off and shagged someone else? I wouldn't care. DECLAN: Is that what you want? For me not to care? Or are you just trying to do my head in? Mess everything up? Sex don't mean that much to me. Do I have to draw you a fucking picture? [MUSIC PLAYING] How are you? Oh, I'm much better, thank you. We'll see [INAUDIBLE] dancing. Oh no. Hello. Got you a drink. Oh, lovely. What is it? Gin and tonic. Told you. Well, you two look very well. That shirt of mine looks very good on you, Charlene. So what we're going to do? Well I'm going on. I'd like it if you would come with me. You mean Declan, so he can drive if you fall ill again? Yes, but I'd like to have both of you with me. Well, why don't you just wait until you're better? Well, as a matter of fact, I'm not going to get better. It's terminal. But I can keep the pain at bay with these lovely rocks. When-- I mean, how long? Well, a week, a month, three months at the most. Where are you going? Brodgar. Hey? Orkney, The Ring of Brodgar. It's a prehistoric stone circle. I want to see the sunrise there on September 21. You're go to Orkney to see some fucking stones? Yes, well, you see, Charlene, I haven't always been a lonely, old dyke. When I was a raw recruit, I met an older woman, full colonel, she was. Would you like to see her? There we are. There's Joe. She grew up on Orkney, and she used to tell me about these stones between the locks. And we always meant to sit in the circle and watch the sunrise together, very romantic. But we never did. I'd like to feel close to her again. What you need me for? Because, to tell you the truth, I'm rather scared. I don't much want to die alone. What's funny? Oh, look at them dancing. CHARLENE: Silly, old bags. VERA: They're magnificent. Well they're close to the darkness too, and they're bloody well dancing. Poor Vera. Yeah. You OK? I was jealous. It was a wee kick in the guts for me, that's because I like you a lot. You don't really know me. When you do, you won't. How do you know? Anyway, you don't know me. I didn't tell you the truth about my mum. She didn't fuck off. Is she dead then? No, she's at home, checking the post every morning, waiting for a letter from me, worrying about me. And what about your dad? He's struggling to survive. He's a fascist when it comes to animals. He's not so bad. I used to be so angry with him. I'm so fucking ordinary. What a wanker, hey? No. You're just a fucking liar. So we know all about each other then? No, we don't. I'm cursed. Please don't say that. But it's true. I am. He's not my dad. Who? My dad. He's not my real dad. Bob's my real dad. But I thought he was your granddad? He is. He's both. My mum is my mum and my sister. How do you know? Bob told me, when he got into bed with me. But that's not your fault. Don't you get it? Look at me. I'm not right, fucked up, just a fuck up. I could've stopped him, you know? Could have long before I did, but I just let him carry on. And I realized what he were doing were wrong, but-- It doesn't change the way I feel about you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being a cow to you. You have nothing to be sorry for. I don't know what else to do. Hold me. [MUSIC - SARAH JAY HAWLEY, "WHAT IF"] (SINGING) What if I made you promise to give whatever I wanted. DECLAN: How is she? Asleep, I think. There's no one about. It's like the end of the world. DECLAN: I like it. CHARLENE: Is that why you're doing it, helping Vera? So you can drive around in the middle of nowhere? DECLAN: Partly. CHARLENE: What else then? DECLAN: Because it's what then, because it's better than not doing it. And anyway, what else are we going to do? Don't know what difference it makes. DECLAN: It makes a difference to her. But she's still going to die though. Yeah, we're all going to die. I wonder if that man had a wife and kids. Who? The guard, the one I hit. I don't know. What a mess, hey? What a fucking mess. [MUSIC - SARAH JAY HAWLEY, "WHAT IF"] (SINGING) I want the sadness to go now. All I need is tonight as a friend. Not ahead of me, here to hold me when the rain comes. Not afraid to be, be the keeper of my heart. I need to stretch my legs. We better let killer have a leak before morning. Yeah, OK. Listen, I'll come back when the line starts moving, all right? Come on you. Let's go, out, out, out. [BARKING] That's it boy, that's it, come on, come on, come on come on. VERA: You two seem to be getting on better. Yeah. Shut up. Can I have a word, son? Where do you come from? Oh, shit! I think you'll have to come along with us. Come on, son. Come on! Oh, no. Not now. You could do something, Vera. You could help him. What do you suggest? Um. I don't know. Well, there must be something. What did they want you for, Charlene? What have you and Declan done? I can't just leave him, Vera. [SHIP'S HORN] We've got to. I'm sorry. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCRAPING] Oh, shit! [CARS HOOTING] Piss off, will you? Can you manage? Yes, of course I can bloody manage! Oh, Jesus. Vera? Not far now. At last! Thank you. I'm sorry about Declan, Charlene. Story of my fucking life. Any time I find something nice it gets taken away. I miss him, you know. I even miss the bloody dog. [LAUGHING] [COUGHING] This should do, hey Vera? Yes, this-- this will do nicely. Yeah. It's [INAUDIBLE] when it's [INAUDIBLE].. I know. I just-- Is the pain very bad? No, I'm all right. I'm just so tired. It's lovely. Thank you for coming, Charlene. I'm glad I did. I couldn't have done it without you. Declan was right, you know? It wasn't your fault. You don't know the half of it. I'm sure. But I think I understand how you feel. How? Well, I was young once too. My life was very different to yours. But when I was about 15 I thought I was the oddest girl in the whole world, certainly in Aldershot. Why? Because, as you put it, I am a lonely dyke, and was then, except that I didn't know. There weren't any words for what I was, none that I knew. Sex was a taboo subject, so I had to keep myself a secret. And that's difficult, isn't it? Then I was picked up by this rack, a woman soldier. That was my first time. Up until then, I didn't think there was anyone else like me, so I joined up double quick. And you met the woman in the photograph, Joe? Yes. That was quite different. We fell in love. It was wonderful. She taught me so much, not to be ashamed. I stopped apologizing for myself and got on with my life. This is nice, hey Vera? Are you cold? Can I do something? Would you mind holding me? How's that? That's better. Will you stay with me? Course I will. We'll watch the sunrise together, hey? Vera? Vera? Vera? [HOOTING] Declan! I thought I'd lost you! Not just yet. Killer, what have they done to you? It's the law. What do you mean, it's the law? It wasn't me they arrested, it was killer, Dangerous Dogs Act. Trouble was when they let me go I missed the last ferry. Come on, you. I got there this morning. We must have passed each other. I found her. You nicked Vera's van. I figured she wouldn't mind. I know. I'm sorry you had to face it alone. I didn't. I was with Vera. I've got some news. I phoned John. Irish John? Yeah. It's good and bad. What's the bad news? John's been arrested. Is he all right? He's out on bail, reckons it will give him time to chill out. So what's the fucking good news? The guard you hit, he's all right. Well, he's alive. What? Loads of fun for being a hard bastard. The worst that's going to happen if you go back is you'll get done for assault, according to John. But, and this is the best part, they aren't looking for you or me. We're in the clear, Charlene. As far as that goes. He's still out there. Your dad? Michael, yeah. I've stopped running, Declan. What do you mean? I'm going back to get Jackie. Are you sure? Oh yeah, I'm sure. He's going to pay for what he's done. I think I'd like to go home now. With you, you pillock. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BARKING] Come on! [INAUDIBLE], you bastard. [MUSIC - GRAND THEFT AUDIO, "THE LIGHT OF DAY"] (SINGING) It's coming around. I've been oh so cold. From where I stand. It fits in my hands. It's so demanding, easy baby. Any day now my heart will listen too. The light of day. There is no other way. Jackie! (SINGING) The light of day. Through the light of day. Oh, the light of day. [MUSIC - HEATHER SMALL, "I'M NOT AFRAID"] (SINGING) Know that the world is turning. And we're running to keep up with the pace. The body and heart still learning. There are problems I know I still have to face. I'm not afraid. Know that the sky is broken. And my shoulders can hardly take the weight. The spirit and soul still open to believe there is something more than fate. The world is turning, ever changing. Every turn keeps hope alive. No matter what tomorrow brings, we can't hold back the hands of time. Too many days I've been afraid. Too many nights when alone I laid. Human and full of frailty. But the world is mine and belongs to me. I'm not afraid. Afraid.
