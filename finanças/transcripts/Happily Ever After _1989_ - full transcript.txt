We all know the story of a maid named Snow White and of how the good dwarves tried to hide her from sight. And who can forget how that Wicked Queen, the creep, gave Snow White the apple to cause eternal sleep? Poison is strong, but love stronger still. One day came a Prince riding over the hill. With love in his heart, he reached out his hand. His touch woke Snow White and brought joy to the land. What follows now? A wedding. Well, then let all the dwarves be our seven best men. Good. Look. They rode into the sunset and threw green clover. But that isn't the end. No, our story's not over. So for those of you who feel perplexed and want to know what happens next, we are proud to present, for your fun and delight, the continuing story of the Prince and Snow White. ♪ You can do magic, with your own two hands. ♪ ♪ You can touch the clouds, right where you stand. ♪ ♪ You can see rainbows, every place you turn. ♪ ♪ Deep in the night, a place still burns. ♪ ♪ Total original, you're one of a kind. ♪ ♪ You've got the heart, and you've got the might. ♪ ♪ No, it won't be easy.

No more Evil Queen! That old hag won't be pushing us around no more, Batso! Gee, that's not a very nice thing to call her. You some kind of birdbrain or something? These are the happiest days of our lives! Well, I can't help it, Scowl. I still feel sorry for the poor Wicked Queen. -Sorry?! You're a bat. You're supposed to be bad. -Bad? Yeah. Mean. Ruthless. Cruel. Rotten to the core. Like me. Nobody's perfect. What's going on here?! Did you invite him? Where is my sister? Good evening, Your L-Lord. Scowl, all at arms. Nice night, ain't it? -Where is she? She... She went out for... a walk. Right, Batso? -Scowl. You know we're not supposed to tell fibs. She did go out for a walk. Yeah, but you didn't say when. Ah, my sister's magic looking glass. It will tell me what I want to know. Looking glass upon the wall, at my command, you will show me all. Keep it down, you noisy creep. You're ruining my beauty sleep. How dare you?! Do your worst. As you can see, your magic cast no spell on me. Is that so? If you don't show me what happened to my sister, I'll break you into a thousand pieces! Oh, that might be a different story. I'll show you all, but you'll be sorry. Sorry... Whatever. When water flows as though it's bled, and sky does change from blue to red, it's a sign to all. The Queen is dead. Ah! I scared myself. No, it can't be. How did this happen?! Here's the news. Your jealous sister met her plight trying to harm the fair Snow White. Snow White?! And who's the pretty boy she's with? Ah, that'd be the Prince, Your Lordship. Snow White and her Prince. Aren't they the happy couple? From this day forward, I shall rule this castle and all that is in it. I will control the laws of nature and bend them to my will. You and every wretched creature like you will do my bidding. I will twist and change and distort everything in the Realm of Doom! I shall have one purpose and one purpose only. Vengeance! Snow White and her handsome prince shall pay for what has happened to my sister. ♪ Listen, kid, I think you should know, ♪ ♪ bad like me is the way to go.

Come on, Batso. Where are we going? To help Lord Maliss get Snow White. We gotta get back on his good side. Which side is that? Batso, we're gonna show him we can be really bad. I can't wait to see them again. Me neither. If it weren't for the Seven Dwarfs, I never would have found you. Do you think it's silly to ride all this way just to invite them to the wedding? -Not if it makes you happy. Look at those flowers. Oh, I'd love to pick some for the dwarfs. -Go ahead. Is it safe to stop here? -Don't worry, Snow White. There's nothing to be afraid of. With the Wicked Queen gone, who would harm us? Ready, Batso? Well, I... I think so. -I want you to be a vicious, heartless fighting machine. The very baddest there is. Would you settle for just one of the top ten? Snow White! Come on! Come on! Come on, boy! Watch me stop the Prince. Hey, I'm back... That's what I call bad. Get away from me! Watch this. I'll get her from behind. Not bad. Run, Snow White! Run! Don't turn back! I've never seen such magic as this. Who are you? What do you want? I'll find your Snow White. You can be sure of that. And I have a very special fate in store for you. Very special indeed. Where am I? Could it be? It's the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs. I'm so tired. I can't go on. Hello? Hello? Where are you? I'm so thirsty. I hope you won't mind. My... Your cottage sure is grown. It's beautiful. Oh, my. Oh, my goodness. Well, you're not the Seven Dwarfs. -I should say not. But the Seven Dwarfs live in that cottage. -Not anymore. They opened up a new mine way over in the next kingdom. Oh, but, then, who are you? We're their cousins, the Seven Dwarfelles. They gave us their cottage. That's no use. I just can't get it right.

Oh, that really burns me up. Thunderella, your name should be Blonderella. Excuse me. I don't believe I've got your names. I'm Muddy. I'm in charge of the earth itself. While Sunburn is merely in charge of the sunlight. Merely? Oh, no. Here we go again. That's Blossom. She's in charge of all the plants and flowers. A pleasure, darling. Nice to meet you. And that's Marina. Hello there. I'm in charge of all the lakes and rivers. Hello, I'm Critterina. I take care of all the animals in the forest. Moonbeam's in charge of the night. She's not herself during the day. And who's the one who sang the lovely song? That's Thunderella. Mother Nature's called her up for review. That's never happened before. I haven't even introduced myself. I'm Snow White. Snow White? Our cousins told us all about you. You and the Prince were to be married. We were coming to invite the Seven Dwarfs to the wedding, but something terrible happened. I was attacked and carried off by a horrid bird. Didn't the Prince come to your rescue? -Oh, he tried. Isn't that what a prince is for? We were separated. And now I'm afraid something horrible has happened to him. I've just got to find him. There must be something we can do. I've got it. Come with us to see Mother Nature. She'll help find the prince. Mother Nature? I hope she can. Looking glass upon the wall, at my command, you will show me all. Hold up. -I know that cottage. Those infernal Seven Dwarfs live there. No longer do the Dwarves there dwell. Seems in their stead live Seven Dwarfelles. Dwarfelles, eh? Useless little fools. Snow White?! Show me where they're headed. Rainbow Falls. This time Snow White won't be so lucky. And that birdbrain Scowl better not get in my way again. Scowl? Scowl! Where are you?! If I ever see that owl again, there'll be nothing left but a pile of feathers. Why didn't we tell Lord Maliss where we were? Didn't you hear what he said? He's gonna tear us apart. Well, he didn't say anything about tearing me apart. Come on, Batso! -Now, what are we gonna do? Just what you'd expect from two guys as bad as us. Yeah? What's that? -We're gonna hide. Why, what's the matter, Thunderella? Oh, I can't do anything right. The others are all so special. Muddy's smart, and Sunburns's brave and strong and oh, Blossom's so pretty. You're special too. You are. Everyone is in their own way. Not me. Except for making mistakes all the time. Just keep doing your best and being yourself. Come on. We're almost there. Where are we? Mother Nature's garden. I'm sure it won't be as bad as you think. Yeah, she's right. It'll probably be much worse.

Oh, she's botched it up again. But I know what she was trying to make. Of course, I wouldn't expect the likes of you to figure it out. I know. She was trying to make a catfish. Must be beginner's luck. Dear me. You won't do at all. Oh, let's see. A dash of this. A pinch of that. Maybe this will work. Oh, I hope I haven't goofed again. -Bet you can't guess that one. Is it a horsefly? Have you played this before? Oh, what about this? Smart alec. A bullfrog. Well done, Muddy! I know. I know. It's a cape rat. It's a dormouse, silly. ♪ And with a little alteration, I make my creation. ♪ Yeah. Oh, you're here. Good. All seven of you. And who might you be, young lady? I'm Snow White. The Dwarfelles said you might help me. Oh, they did, did they? Well, I'll get to you in a minute. First I have some business with them. Will the negligent party step forward? Does that me? Undo precipitation when air conditions were appropriate. Injudicious use of anemometry. Inadequate comprehension of climatology. Does that cover it? And not only that. I can't control the weather. That's precisely what I said. I never should have let the lot of you have such powers. See, I told you she'd take away Thunderella's powers. The lot of us? -But, Mother Nature... Oh, don't think I haven't noticed all your squabbling, using earthquakes and sunbeams at your every whim. That's not what I gave you your powers for. You were supposed to work together, to help me when I can't be there, to create harmony. So you see, that's why we cannot tolerate mistakes in this line of work. What about all the mistakes you make? I beg your pardon? Begging your pardon. But even you make mistakes. Oh, little ones, here and there. Don't you see? If everyone would just give Thunderella a chance, I'm sure she could do her job. I'm sorry, young lady. My decision is final. The Dwarfelles shall be stripped of their powers. Mother Nature, do something! She can't even make a proper dormouse. How's she gonna... Stand back, woman. This is none of your affair. Don't worry. He can't harm us here. Now be gone before I get mad. Don't you want to know what happened to your precious Prince? Oh, please. Yes. Thought so. The answer lies in my castle, in the Realm of Doom. And not even Mother Nature can stop me there. He looked so terrible. -Unbelievable, my dear. He was wearing last year's cape. Oh, dear. The uncivilized brute. Don't you worry. You'll be safe if you stay with us. Mother Nature will protect you. -No, I must go to the Realm of Doom. No, you mustn't! No. You'd never come back. You're certain you want to do this? I must find my Prince. -Well, it won't be easy. Could the Seven Dwarfelles come with me? Yes! -You want them? Very well. You miscreants have one last chance to prove yourselves competent beneficiaries of the powers with which I've endowed you. Lord Maliss is very powerful. In his own domain, even I cannot stop him. Above all else, Snow White, you must keep your wits about you. Thank you, Mother Nature. Oh, there you are, you naughty little creation. Now go. Follow the path past the seven pines and over the seven peaks. The path leads through a cave and into the Realm of Doom. But remember, the closer you get to your destination, the more dangerous your journey will become. I tell you, darlings, it looks awfully dark in there. We need light. Sunburn, can you help us? They don't call me Sunburn for nothing. Look. It's beautiful. -Gives me the creeps. Look, there's someone in the shadows. Hey. Hey, who was he? There he goes. Get that Shadow Man! Quick, over here! He's hurt. No, don't! I bet he works for Lord Maliss. No! No, no. What are you trying to tell us? Oh, it's about time something good happened on this trip. That poor little man. If only I could have helped him. Oh, he gave me the willies. I hope he got free. -Quick, quick look. We made it to the Realm of Doom. I bet this very minute the prince is watching us from one of those castle windows. Perfect! Soon I shall have my revenge. It seems she falls in the trap of malice, but in this fog, she ain't going to find the palace. You are insolent! But you do have a point. We wouldn't want her to lose her way. Perhaps I will provide an escort. Why do we have to stay here? -I told you. Lord Maliss will never find us down here. What did the doggies want, Scowl? Dinner. -I thought you were bad. -I am. Well, why did the doggies want bad food? I thought you said he'd never find... I have a little task for you, my pets. You will bring Snow White to me. Do what you like with those idiot Dwarfelles. But do not harm Snow White. I want that pleasure myself. Now go. Quickly! Scowl! Evening, Your Worship. Fancy running into you down here. The pleasure is all mine. Now there will be something to amuse me while I await Snow White. Boy. I bet Scowl will really have fun. Nice little... Little... Thing. Now, now, Mother Nature wouldn't like that. I don't think these are Mother Nature's creatures, Critterina. That's right. This place ain't natural. I think I have to give this place a facelift. Oh my goodness. I don't think your powers are going to be much help here. Thunderella? Thunderella, what is it? -I heard something out there. I don't hear anything. -Shh. Listen. Thunderella! Stay back! I'm warning you! Good morning. A one, and the two, and the three. Moonbeam. Moonbeam. -Morning, Critterina. Critterina, tell them to get out of here. What did they say? -I didn't get all of it. Something about Dwarfelles and... Dessert. This way. Oh, no. The Shadow Man. He wants us to come. Don't trust him. -It's our only hope. Come on! Come on, girls. Push! She leads a charmed life. Well, no more. I'll handle this personally. Your Lordship, y-y-y-y-y... You're not leaving, are you? Not that there hasn't been a barrel of laughs at all, but... W-w-w, wait. What about me? Aren't you gonna... Hey! Lord Maliss! Come back! Please. Please, wait. Please. Don't run away. I only want to thank you. You saved us from the wolves. And back in the cave, you were trying to warn us about something. It's almost as though you've... You've been watching over me, caring for me. Like... Like a friend. Snow White? Where are you? -Snow White? I better get back to the others. Won't you come with me? That is, if you want to. Please, come. Come on. What are you doing? No, no, no. He's gonna do something... Horrible. I know it. Not if we have anything to say about it. Come on. That ding-dong bat. I try to help him. I try to teach him what I know. This is where it gets me. It ain't fair. Wow, you look real bad. Batso. Hey, Scowl. You really got to quit smoking. It's gonna kill you. I'm about to be owl stew, and he's worried about smoking. Batso, quick. Shake a wing. -Okay. No, blow out the candle! Oh, sure thing, Scowl. What are you waiting for? -I can't decide what to wish for. Batso! We gotta get out of here. Come on, Batso. Now where are we going? As far away from Lord Maliss as we can get. Too bad we can't stay for the party. Party? Those are the Seven Dwarfelles. Now what? How do we get in? Hey, somebody let us in! We're here on official business of Mother Nature. Come on, Batso. This is our big chance. Lord Maliss will have to forgive us if we capture one of them. You always have such bad ideas. Open or you'll be sorry! Get the loud mouth. -I'm warning you, when I lose my temper, I really get carried away. At last. We've got it. Batso, how does it feel to be really bad? It feels bad. -Oh, this burns me up. Let go of me, you little creep. You mean him? Come on, girls. Time for action. Get them! Snow White. Snow White, wake up. My Prince? Is... Is it really you? -Who else would it be? Quickly. We must hide. But where are... -No time for questions. But... Hurry. I wonder where he's taking her. Needn't worry any more. Beneath the Queen, a secret door. Wonderful. A looking glass that talks. Beneath the Queen, huh? No way. See? It's a trick. It's not here. Not here either. Look, it's goinng down. -The secret tower. Well, how do you like that? Thank you, my darling. Darling! -Darling, darling. I like it. Now you're cooking. I'm through with malice. You're better looking. Come on, girls. Talking looking glasses, tricky queens, secret doors. This place burns me up. Hey! Where are you taking me? Please, can we go home? Oh, we are going home, Snow White. I... I don't understand. -You will. I've never seen you like this. Please, tell me where you're taking me? What's wrong, my dear? Don't you trust your beloved Prince? Here we are. You will look out on this forever. What are you talking about? Look. You're not my Prince. You'll never see your Prince again! No! Stay away! You're cold, Snow White. Let me give you my cloak. No! You! It's stone. The cape turned it to stone! Come on. You miserable wretch! No, no. You killed him. You monster! Choose your pose, Snow White. You'll stand here forever, cast in stone. Don't you dare! Oh, Snow White. -Thunderella. Can you untie me? Nasty little creatures! Especially this one. No. No! Seven new statues I hadn't even counted on. And now you, Snow White, a moment I shall long cherish. Finally, your good luck runs out! Now, as my sister perished... -No. So shall you! Come on. Come on, work. Look! Snow White, they're okay now! I cared for him as dearly as the Prince. And now I've lost them both. Just as love brings the greatest joy, it can also bring the greatest sorrow. But then it is love which makes people the most special of all my creatures. It's all right, Snow White. Don't cry. It's you. It's you! It was you all along. Maliss cast a spell on me. But I swore I'd never stop trying to protect you. Oh, I can't believe it's true! -This time, Snow White, I'll never leave your side. If it weren't for your help, I never would have seen my Prince again. Some of us were a little more helpful than others. Honestly, Sunburn. Must you take all the credit? Not me. Thunderella. You really came through. We better be going. We'll be late for a certain wedding. I want all of you to come. Oh, and Seven Dwarfs too. Is it all right, Mother Nature? Can we go to Snow White's wedding? Very well. But, when you return, you're gonna have to face the music. But, you mean... -Even after we... You're not still going to... -Take away their powers? Oh, gracious. No. They've proven themselves. When they return, they'll get right back to their old jobs. And we will have two new apprentices to train. Hey, I can breathe. You know, Batso, maybe working for this Mother Nature ain't gonna be so bad. I can even smell again. -With your cigar, you always smelled. Are you ready to live happily ever after?
