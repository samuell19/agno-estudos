[projector rattling] [soft piano music] - [Man] Life was great for our father. He worked hard and was good to us. He and Mom raised us well. He was truly on top of the world. Mom was crazy about him and we kids adored and looked up to him. He was our rock. With a stellar career in banking, Dad's future looked bright, and retirement was just on the horizon. [dog barking] - [Woman] There are more eggs of you'd like. - I'm good, Babe. I gotta go. I'm meeting up with Steve to play a little racquetball this morning, before I go into my meeting. Thanks though. - Okay, well I made enough food to feed an army. - You did. You need to stop cooking so much. It's just Emily and me now. Emily eats like a bird, and the boys aren't here anymore. - I know, but somehow it makes me feel better, like maybe if I cook a lot of food the kids will stay. - Careful for what you wish for. Emily graduates from high school soon, and you and I will be empty-nesters, at last. - I know, don't remind me. - See ya. Oh. - You're good to go. - Good? Okay. - You know I let you beat me on that last one. - Yeah, sure you did. - I did! You got a board meeting this morning, I want you to feel invincible. - Steve, you haven't beat me in three years. - My point exactly. - You done talkin'? - Yeah, I'm done, let's go. Come on grandma, I've got a moon pie comin'. - Good, because I'm gonna crush you again. - Yeah, I've got your crush. You okay? Okay? You good? You wanna keep going? - I'm fine. - Okay. - I'm fine. - Okay, all right. Then let's go. - You're not gettin' out of it this easy. So, we're expecting a further increase in these rehab loans as more and more homeowners become aware of their availability. And for next quarter's projections, I'm gonna turn the time over to Weston Moss. Weston. - Thank you, sir. Before we look at our projected earnings, I want to tell you something. These numbers, they're realistic possibilities. Under Mister Roberts' leadership and new direction for the bank, this isn't some pipe dream, this is where things are really going. Would you pass these down sir? Thank you so much. Once you get your report, please turn to page two, where you will see next quarter's projected earnings. [tense orchestral music] - Mister Roberts? Mister Roberts? - David? Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm okay. - So please go ahead and open up your reports to page two, and we'll check out those projected earnings. Thank you. - I don't see what the big deal is, I'll pay you back. - That's what you said last time. - Oh, come on mom, I'm in a real jam here. I gotta pay off my lawyer to cover my DUI, and cover my rent. I'm starting a new job next week. - I'll have to speak to your father first. - Then call him. Please, this is important. [chuckling] [muffled speaking] - Sure. Yeah, just pay it off. I don't care, it'll maybe help him get back on track. I'm just a little tired. I think it was the racquetball this morning. Yeah. Okay, I love you, I'll see you tonight. - I can't tell you how much this means to me, thank you. - Just don't let us down this time, Jacob. - I won't, you have my word. I gotta go, I love you. - Hey, Thanksgiving dinner, tomorrow, four o'clock. - I'll be here. [somber instrumental music] [door closing] - That must be your dad. Hey honey, how was your day? - It was all right. - I'm glad you're home. - Me too. - Let me help you with that. - Smells good in here. - Pumpkin pie, your favorite. - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I think I'm just gonna go lay down for a few minutes. - All right. I'll just finish up in here, and then I'll be up in a little while. - Yeah, okay. - Hey daddy! - Hi, Angel. We'll talk later, okay. - Okay. - David? David? Are you okay? - I must have dozed off. - But your eyes were open, and you were drooling. - I was? - Yeah. Honey, maybe we should call the doctor? - No, no I'm fine, I just, I just need to get a night's rest. I'll be better in the morning. - Don't you want to change? - I think I just want to lay down. [sentimental instrumental music] - Grandpa! - Hey! How are you? You ready for some turkey dinner? - Yeah, I'm starved. - Oh, me too. - You look beautiful, Mom. - Thanks. - How are you son? - Doing great Dad, thanks. - [David] How are you, April? Matthew treatin' you right? - Yes, he's a true gentleman. You raised him well. - Listen, I know that dinner's almost ready, and Ethan and Emily are downstairs, but I have not seen Jacob yet. - Well, mister self control's out there feedin' his habit, so I'll go grab him. - Great. Come on in. - You gonna come in and eat, or stand out here and smoke yourself to death? - Vaping, it's called vaping. - I don't care what it's called. I'm sure it'll kill you eventually. - I'll be right in. - We're waiting. - I'll be right in. - Whatever, man. - Father, we're thankful for all the blessings. We're thankful for each other, and the love that we share, and for our freedoms. We're thankful for this food, and we ask you to bless it, and those that are less fortunate, that they might find comfort this day. In Jesus' name, amen. - Amen. - Let's eat. [all conversing] - Here we go. [chatting] - Hang on. Okay, let me think a minute. When Jacob was a little boy, he wanted to eat a hot dog without a bun. Of course he was too small to use a knife, so he had to get the hot dog and he'd take a bite with his teeth like this, and then pull that piece out, set it on his plate, stick a fork in it, and then eat it. [laughing] - Not much has changed. - When Emily was a little girl, she had this pair of really fancy dress shoes, and she couldn't get the buckles. So I helped her put 'em on, and she went to the mirror to admire how beautiful she was, and she was so happy she turned around and she said, my shoes say, "Thank you, Janice." - Why are you telling stories like that? You shouldn't be telling stories like that, it's not right! - Dad, are you okay? - [Jacob] Hey Dad, hey look. - Stop telling these stories! It isn't right! And I don't know any of you people. - Dad, what's going on? - Just get them out of here! - Dad, Dad, it's us. - Mom, what's going on? Dad? Mom? Is he okay? - Hello David, Janice, it's nice to see you again. Why don't you have a seat? Well, we have the results back from the MRI, and every test we ran. The good news is we can't see anything that shouldn't be there. In other words, no tumors or cysts. We won't have to remove anything. But we did see something that causes concern. This is a healthy brain. Notice the dark areas surrounding the sulcus folds of the brain. This is the brain of an advanced Alzheimer's patient. You can see how much thicker those dark areas surrounding the folds are. This occurs as older brains atrophy and shrink. - Wait a minute. Why are we talking about Alzheimer's? David's only 55. - This is the MRI scan of David's brain. You can see how those dark areas surrounding the folds are more pronounced. I've had my colleague, Doctor Stevens, take a look, and he concurs with the diagnosis. It looks like early onset Alzheimer's. - No one in David's family has had any problems like this. In fact, his dad was sharp as a tack until the day he died. - Early-onset Alzheimer's can run in families but, it can also occur in individuals that have no history of it. - I don't care about the statistics. I am in no position to be incapacitated. There must be some treatment, there must be some medication that you can give me. I'm sorry. - There are some medications that seem to help, and of course, we'll get you started on two of those right away. But currently, there is no cure. - Okay. What do we do next? - Rely on your friends and family. While the disease is in its early stages still, it's important to think about the future and put all your important documents in order, should your health take a turn for the worse. [crying] [solemn instrumental music] - Okay. [birds singing] - I'll be back to help you put the groceries away in a minute, okay? - I got it, babe. - Thank you. - That better not be pot you're smoking. - And what if it was? - Well, A, you're supposed to be watching Dad so Mom can have some time to herself. B, this is Mom and Dad's house, so you shouldn't be smoking anything, anyways. And C, if that is pot, I should kick your sorry butt. - Then kick it, everyone else does. - Jacob, nobody treats you worse than you treat yourself. Why don't you just put a little effort into life, and stop living like a criminal? - I didn't cause all this, okay? I'm not guilty. - Don't you get it? If you're an accessory to a crime, you're a criminal. You're just lucky you're on house arrest, instead of inside a jail cell like your friend, Eddy. - You think I'm lucky? If I were lucky, Dad would still have his wits about him and hired a decent attorney to get me out of this mess. - You don't need Dad to keep you out of trouble. You gotta screw your frickin' head on straight and keep yourself out of trouble. - You know what Matthew, just go. - [April] Hey, you okay? - Yeah, if having a loser for a brother is okay, everything's just dandy. - Sorry, honey. - I mean, how many times does he have to make the same mistake, before he pulls his head out? - I think everything's gonna be okay. - I'm gonna go check on Dad. - He's in the living room watching TV. - Hey Dad. How are you feeling today? - I was watching that show, but I don't like it when all the teams don't get to win. - Yeah Dad, not all of us get to win. Hey listen, April's in the kitchen making lunch. BLT's. - What's a BLT? - It's a sandwich, Dad. You want a sandwich? - Yes, I would like a sandwich. - Okay, come on. Here you go, Dad. Go ahead, you can eat. [somber piano music] - Oh, honey I forgot napkins. - I'll go grab some. [gentle instrumental music] - Hey. - Hey. - Everything okay? - Yeah. I just want to know why. - We'll get through this. - Let me get to the point, Dave had a really great financial plan. Had he had a few more years to work it, you'd be in great shape. But with his career being cut so short, you really aren't in a position to be without income anymore. His medical bills have tapped your 401K plan. His disability benefits alone, aren't enough to cover your house payment. You have a savings account, but at this point there are only a few thousand dollars left in that account. - What do you suggest I do? - Well, you have several options. One, you could downsize. You have equity in your home. If you got into a smaller house, his disability payments would just about keep you afloat. - How much smaller? - In the 120,000 dollar range. - What's option number two? - You could refinance. - And then be in debt for another 20 years, that's not what I want. - Well, in about seven years your home is gonna be paid off. You could get a job to supplement your income. I know, nobody wants to go back to work. But with additional income, you could stay in the home you're in. I'm sorry Janice, this is tough. Why don't we do this another day? I don't have to know this minute. Why don't you take some time, and consider what's best for you. - I'm not crying because the options are so bad, just that I'm so alone. For most of the past two years, I've been alone in everything I do. He doesn't even recognize me anymore, Steve. It's as though I don't even exist in his world. And it's so strange living with him. I wish, just for a minute even that, that David could be himself. That would help so much. - I can't begin to understand your pain. But I really think you should go back to work. Just to be around other people, and get out. - But who would take care of David? You just said the money's all gone. - I don't know. What would David do? He was always a good strategizer. What do you think he would want you to do? - Well, if he were at the bank, he'd call a board meeting. [somber piano music] - Hey babe. How was school? - You mean work and school? - Yeah, yeah that's right. I forgot you had to work today, too. - I'm exhausted. I can't keep doing this by myself anymore, Ethan. Did you hear what I just said? - Yeah, yeah, what? - Stop playing your game for just a second, please! - Okay, yeah, sorry. What's up? - What's up is that I need some help around here. - Yeah, I know. I mean I cleaned up the place pretty much perfectly, it's spotless. - No, not really, but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm not getting any more money from my parents, okay? That's why I'm working. I need you to get a job and pitch in. We've talked about this before. - Yeah, I know. Like I've been looking, okay? It's just nowhere decent is hiring. [phone ringing] - Hey Mom. I'm good. No, it's okay, what's going on? Okay, I'll be there. I will, I'll leave right now. I love you, too. I have to go. - Go where? - Home. - It's almost a four-hour drive. - It's important, Ethan. And if I leave right now, I'll be there by eight, okay? You're welcome to come with me if you'd like, but I'm leaving. - I'm coming, wait, hold on. I'm coming. - I'm glad you're all here. Thanks for coming. I need all of your help. I need to figure out some different ways to care for Dad. What I mean is, I have to get a job. - Mom, why do you have to get a job? - Yeah, what's going on? I thought the house was paid off. - The house was almost all paid off, but your dad and I decided that this addition was worth refinancing the house for. - That's typical. - [Matthew] What did you say? - Just saying it's typical. I mean a middle-aged American male leaves his family in financial trouble. - Ethan, if you say anything like that again, I'm gonna knock your freeloading head off. Mom, why is he even here? - Mom, please. - Stop it. Just stop arguing. Ethan, no one has done anything wrong here. David and I had a very solid financial plan, which was turned upside down by an unexpected disease. We're going to get through this, but I need extra income right now in order to keep the house. So I just have to work for a few years until it's paid off. - Mom, don't go back to work, please. I mean, who's gonna take care of Dad while you're gone? - That's why you're all here. I need your help to figure it out. - I could watch him. I mean I'm already here, I can't go anywhere. Why not use me? You can pay me a little for the effort, I'm not making any money being locked up here. - Forget it, you can barely take care of yourself, let alone someone else, especially somebody in Dad's situation, no way. - The TV's not working anymore. - Oh, I'll take care of this. You guys keep going. Sweetheart, come with me and grandpa. - I've considered a few options, and one thing is we could have someone come into the home and care for Dad. - That sounds expensive. - It is. - Well, care centers can be cheaper than individual care. - What are the other options, Mom? - There aren't many. One thing some people do is, they do a rotating, like 'take care of Dad' assignment, but we don't have enough people in our family to do that, especially with you away at college, and you know that I want you to finish your degree. - Look, Mom's paycheck is mostly gonna be eaten up by a house payment, I can tell you that right now. Unless Matthew has a bunch of money he wants to get rid of, we cannot afford paid care for Dad. - Look Mom, I want to help with the house payment, as much as I can but, I don't know if I'll be able to make the whole thing. I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry. I'm not going to take any of your money anyway. - I want to help, and I will. End of story. - I'm here, I'm free. I mean, I don't cost much. Maybe doing something like this will get me a lighter sentence, and I can earn some extra spending money. - You don't need a lighter sentence, and you definitely don't need any money to feed your habit, so let's check out the facilities just to see. [birds chirping] - You see on the left is our two-bedroom Madrid, and on your right is the one-bedroom Barcelona. [voices speaking on intercom] - This is really nice, Mom. - This is the pricing here, if you'd like to take a look at this. I can give you a tour of the entire facility if you'd like. - That would be helpful, thank you. - Right this way. Mister Mahoney, how are you doing today? - Fantastic, and yourself? - Doing great, thank you. - I'm in the company of a pretty girl, I'm having a good day. [laughing] - Oh, Mister Mahoney, are you ready for lunch? - Yes, I am. You kids take care. - Thank you, you as well. Hi Frank, you you feeling? - I feel good. Have you tasted the food here? It's topnotch. I mean, five star. - I'll say. Have a good one, Frank. - Mom, are you okay? - You have a wonderful facility, but I'm not ready for this. - I'm sorry. - Don't worry, thank you. - Yeah, thanks for coming by today. - Mom, don't do it! - What other choice do I have? - I don't want Dad in there any more than you do, but he is not the answer. - He says he can do it, and I think he's the best answer for right now. - If Jacob weren't a member of our family, would you let him, then? - Jacob is my son. - And he's my brother, and I know him all to well, Mom. His only thought is to take care of himself, to make his life easier. I don't think he's thought for one second that it might take a little effort to watch Dad. - Hey Mom, I brought up some containers from the basement. I thought doing meal prep for several days at once would make things a little easier. - Perfect, I'm wrong. He's a changed man. We're so lucky to have a convict managing our family affairs. - Matthew! - I give up. Just don't give him any money till you find out what kind of job he does. Mom! - I just gave him a little advance so he can keep his bills current. - More like keeping his dealer current. - Hey Janice, how are you settling in? - I'm doing okay. - I think you're really gonna like it here. We're a small group but we're kind of like family. Some days it's very busy, and other days it's hard to stay awake, but it evens out. - Thanks, Alison. It's been a few years since I've been out of the workforce, so it's going to take some catching up. - You will do fine. The hardest part will be the scheduling software, but filing is pretty straightforward, and if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask. - I won't, thank you. - Welcome aboard. - I'm hungry. - Lunch is almost ready Dad, hang tight. - I'm hungry. - I heard you the the first time. [phone buzzing] What's up? - How's Dad doing? - He's doing just as good as he was an hour ago. You don't have to keep checking in with me every five minutes, Matthew. - You are not to be trusted, so I will check up on you as much as I want. - Hey, you're not the boss of me, Matthew. - You sound like a five-year-old. - Well, you're not the boss of me. - I help Mom with the bills now, and part of that money goes to your smoking habit, so actually, yeah I am the boss. - This conversation is over. - Don't you dare hang up on me. - Stop calling, okay, bye. - What an idiot! - There you go, Pops. - It's hot. - Dad, you're making a mess. - Dad, you made a mess. - That's not funny. - That's not funny. - Seriously, stop repeating me. - Seriously, stop repeating me. - Dad. [phone buzzing] Hey Mom, what's up? - Hey I'm just calling to check and see how you're doing on your first day with Dad. - Fine, I'm just feeding him lunch right now. And you will call Matthew and tell him to stop calling me every five minutes? He's driving me nuts. - I will, I'm sure you're doing a great job. - Thanks, how's the first day at work? - It's good. They seem like a really nice bunch of people here. Of course, I have no clue what I'm doing, but they've all assured me that I can handle it. - That sounds good, I got everything under control here. - Hey, make sure you give him his meds. - I will. Mom, I gotta go. - Okay, I'll be home around 5:30. - Okay, sounds good. Come on Dad. Dad, you gotta at least aim for your mouth here, come on. [gentle piano music] Medication time. Hold out your hand, Dad. Come on. Here you are, there you go. Okay, put that in your mouth. Come on, there you go Dad. There you go. Dad, no. Dad, open your mouth. [gentle orchestral music] Come on. - That's good. - Great, okay here. Gotta take this now. Here you go. I'm gonna take the garbage out. Whoa whoa whoa, Dad Dad Dad Dad Dad Dad. Pull the chair out first, come on Dad. Come on, there you go. There you go, there you go, come on. - What do I do now? - How about some more TV, huh? - Okay. - Come on. There you go. Step. Step, there you are. There you go. [game playing on TV] There you go, there you go. Here you can watch. - I don't want to watch sports. - You don't? There's a game on right now. - But I want everyone to win. - Unfortunately, that's not the way it works, Dad. Someone has to lose. You just sit right here, and watch this, you'll feel right at home. I'm gonna go upstairs and rest. If you need anything, just yell, all right? - Okay. - All right. [soft piano music] - So, Janice, what brings you back to the workforce? Wait, let me guess, saving for a getaway cabin? No wait, it's coming to me. Travelman. - I wish it were that exotic. My husband can't work, he's suffering from early onset Alzheimer's, and so I'm just working to pick up the financial slack. - Oh I'm so sorry, Janice, that's gotta be hard. - It's okay, it is but, we're getting through it. - Is he in a facility? - No, he's at home and, fortunately my older son has stepped up so that he can take care of him while I'm at work. - [David] Jacob? Jacob! I don't want to watch this game anymore. Someone's losing. [game playing on TV] [tense music] [birds singing] [dark music] - Dad? [horn honking] Dad? Dad? Dad! Dad, can you hear me? [ominous music] [horn honking] Dad! Dad! [alarm sounding] [dramatic orchestral music] Oh my God! - It's kind of a cold day today. Are you going downtown? - I think so. - This bus is coming, see they're gonna go downtown, or to the shopping center so. [traffic passing] - I like shopping. - Good, this is the right bus. Hey, the bus isn't gonna wait forever. - Do you have any money? Or a card? A card, anything? - Hey. Do you have any money? - Go ahead. - Come on. Looks like it's your lucky day. - Yes, it's my lucky day. - Yeah. [bus engine running] - Okay Mister Glover, we have your closing scheduled for next Tuesday at 10 a.m. with Kevin. We'll see you then. [phone buzzing] - Hi Jacob. - Mom, Dad's gone. - What do you mean, he's gone? - I lost him. He must have gotten out of the house, I can't find him anywhere. - You lost him? How long ago did you lose him, Jacob? - Mom, I don't know, I fell asleep. I must have left the back door open when I took the garbage out. Mom, I can't go look for him, because of the ankle bracelet, you have to get home now. - I'll be right there. [panting] - [Passenger] Hey, this is your stop. - Do I get off now? - Yeah, we're at the mall. - Okay, thank you. - You're welcome, have a good day. - Watch it! - Emily. - Hey! - Emily. - Watch where you're going. - I'm sorry. Was that your new phone? - Yes, it's my new phone. And it seems to be working, but I'm not Emily. Who's Emily? - You are Emily. Where's Jacob? He's supposed to be watching me. - Security? Can you come over here. - How can I help you, ma'am? - This gentleman, I think he's lost, he's looking for somebody named Emily. He thinks I'm Emily, but I've never seen him before. - Sir, this woman isn't Emily. And we need to let her go on with her shopping. - Where's Jacob? - Is that who you're here with, Jacob? - Yes. - We'll take it from here. We'll get on the intercom, we'll find Jacob. - Thank you. Goodbye, I hope you find Jacob. - What's your name, sir? - David. - [Security] Attention, would the party of Jacob please come to the mall office? David is waiting for you. Jacob to the mall office, David is waiting. Hey, I'm sure Jacob will be here soon. He's probably been looking for you. - Okay. - [Woman On Radio] Bob, can you come down to the food court and help me with a situation? - Yeah, what's going on? - I've got a group of boys down here who want you and me to show them where the exit is. - I'll be right there. Hey, I've gotta go for a minute. Jacob's on his way. You can wait here. - Okay. - Jacob! Okay, what have you done so far to find him? - I've only checked the house and the yard, I can't leave. - Okay, did you call the neighbors? - I don't have any of the neighbors' phone numbers, but I called the police. - Good, I'm going to go check the houses close by. I don't think he could have gone too far. - Mom please, Mom please, please. [traffic passing] [horn honking] - Here's a current picture of him. - What the hell Jacob, you lost Dad! - Don't start on me, Matthew, it was an accident. - No, you always have an excuse. - Matthew, please don't do this right now. - Mom, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, he had one job. How hard could it be? You are unbelievable. - Everybody just needs to calm down. Pointing fingers does not help the situation. - Okay, I'm sorry. - I understand, feelings are raw. I was just saying that there's nothing that we can do officially to find your father until he's been missing for 24 hours. But we can keep an eye out for him. - We suggest that as you guys are doing your own search, use a system, like a map, so that way you don't search the same areas twice, while leaving other areas unsearched. What was Mister Roberts wearing? - A red plaid shirt and tan pants. - No jacket? - No. He wasn't wearing a jacket. [dark music] - You all know where you're going to search, right? - Yeah. - Okay, what time should we meet back here? - [Matthew] I think we should go till at least dark. - I agree, I have all of your numbers, so if you see him, call me, and then I'll send out a group text, okay? Jade, sweetie, come with grandma. That way we can have two sets of eyes in every car, all right? - Mom, please let me know when you find him. - I will, okay, good luck. Let's go, okay honey, I need you to help grandma look for grandpa, okay? He's wearing a red shirt, and tan pants. [somber music] - Hey, we overheard your dad is missing. - Yeah, that's my fault. - Could we help you look for him? - You want to look for him? - Yeah, Mister Roberts was always really nice to us. We want to help you find him. - Yeah, we could use all the help we can get, guys. Here's a picture. Thanks. - No problem, we'll let you know when we find him. Let's go, Tyler. See you later! - See you buddy. Thank you. - Excuse me, sir. Have you guys seen this man? This is my Dad, he has Alzheimer's. We can't find him anywhere. - I haven't seen him, have you seen him? - No. - Sorry, man. - Excuse me, have you seen our friend, we're looking for him? - No, we haven't, I'm sorry. - My Dad's gone missing, he has Alzheimer's, and I was wondering if you've seen him. - No, I've never seen him. I hope you find him, good luck to you. - Here's a picture. - No, sorry I haven't, I hope you find him. - Thank you. - Good luck. - [Kid] Let's go! - You know my Mom suffered from Alzheimer's for five years before she died. - Wow, that's a long time. Who took care of her? - My Dad, he was amazing. It was hard on him. Hope we find this guy soon. The world really doesn't know what to do with people who suffer from Alzheimer's. Most people just want to put 'em somewhere out of sight, so they don't have to deal with 'em. [car starting] [light orchestral music] [door closing] - Just a hot dog, anything to drink for you there, buddy? - No. - All right, buck 39. - Oh, I don't have any money. - Dude, if you don't have any money, don't prepare a hot dog. - Okay. [soft guitar music] - Let's go across the street. - No cars, okay, go. [laughing] [child muffled speaking] - Jade? Jade, what are you doing clear out here? - This is my daughter. - Come with me, I'll take you home. - Sir, this is my daughter. - Jade, come take-- - [Child] Uh oh. I don't know. [moaning] - Are you okay? What happened? - I don't know. A man hit me. - A man hit you? Why did he hit you? - I don't know. - It kind of bad. Where is your cell phone? - I don't have a phone. - No phone? - No. - What's your name? - David. - Hi David, I'm Christine. - Hi. - Where do you live? - I don't know. - This cut needs a bandage. I have bandages at my house. I live just over there. You can come with me if you want. - Okay. [gentle piano music] [groaning] - Just over there. [gentle instrumental music] It's okay, it's okay. Don't be afraid. Sit right there. There you go. That should keep the scarring to a minimum. [chuckling] You have a little something there. I'm going to be a nurse, someday. - Thank you, nurse. - You're welcome. Are you cold? I have a big coat that might fit you. You could borrow it if you want. - Okay. [laughing] - You don't need that. Well now we need to figure out where you live, David. - I don't know. I live back there somewhere. - I know that. Everybody lives out there. Except for me. - Where's your house? - This is my house. - This isn't a house. - It is, actually. It's my house. See, this is where the fireplace goes. This is my bedroom. This is where the TV goes. - Where's the TV? - I'll show you. This is my table. See? And, this is my bedroom. This is my plant. And, this is my Mom. I don't know who he is. He was, he's a bad man. But, he's in jail now. And the picture goes right here. See, it's my house. But I have to put it away every day, or someone will steal it. - This is a house. I like it. - Thank you. - Where's your mommy? - The angels took her away. She was, she was too good to live here anymore. - Where's your daddy? - I never had a dad, but I've always wanted to have a dad like other kids have. If I had a dad, life wouldn't be so hard. Even if I'd get to see him once, I would feel better. I just want to know what he looks like. Is he short, or tall? Is he skinny, does he have big muscles? Is he bald, or does he have lots of hair? I hope he has a mustache. - Did you know that I'm a daddy? - You are? How many kids do you have? - I have three. - What are their names? One is Jacob. He gets in trouble. One is Matthew. He's always good. And one is Emily, she's very smart. - Where are your children now? - I don't know where they are now, but they still live here. I like being their daddy. I could be your dad. [laughing] I could be your dad. - What? No, you can't be my dad. - I could be your dad. - My dad? You could be my dad. You could be my dad till we find out where you belong. Then I would have a whole family. I could tell everyone that you're my dad, that I know who my dad is. If you're going to be my dad, you have to do something for me. - What do I have to do? - You have to take me someplace I've always wanted my dad to take me. Good good, keep doing that? - Okay.

French fries are good for you. You got your potato group, and your mineral group, and your ketchup group. How come you're not eating your fries with ketchup? - I don't like ketchup on my french fries. - Are you sure? Ketchup is the best. Didn't you know that they invented ketchup to make french fries taste better? - I didn't know that. - Just kidding, but you should try 'em with ketchup. They're so much better. See? - [David] I like ketchup. - Me too. You have a little something right there. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Maybe we can get a shake and dip our french fries in it. - [David] That would be good. - Mm-hmm. - [David] Where do we go now? - [Christine] Home. - No luck. - Did anyone you talked to even see him? - No, I'm wondering if we're just looking in the wrong places. - Well, maybe he went further than we thought he could. - Or maybe someone found him, and they just are trying to find us. - Why wouldn't they just call the cops at that point? - What do we do now, grandma? - Well, we're going to pray very hard that grandpa's safe and that he's okay. I just hope that if someone has found him that they take him in. It's going to get so cold tonight. - I'm going back out. You guys get some rest. If I don't find him we'll pick up first thing in the morning. - Can I go with you, Dad? - Of course you can, angel. I need some company. - I love you, mommy. - I love you too, sweetheart. Don't forget your jacket, it's so cold out there. Stay safe, okay? - Be careful. - If I find him I'll let you know. - I love you. - This feels good. - Yeah, I like sitting by a fire. I make one almost every night. - Do you sleep here every night? Mm-hmm, until they won't let me anymore. Okay, so I have two sleeping bags. This one's for you. It's the warmest. - No, it's for you. - What? You'll freeze if you don't have a sleeping bag, it gets cold out here at night. - Dad's give the daughters the warm sleeping bag. - Of course they do. I'll take the warm bag. You get the pillow. I can use my teddy bear for a pillow. - That's fair. - Yeah, it is. Well, we should probably get ready for bed. I'll get my stuff ready, and then I'll help you with yours. - Okay. [tense music] - Well hon, we'd better call it a night. - But we need to find grandpa, Dad! - I know but, we'll pick back up first thing in the morning, okay? - Okay. - Don't worry, we'll find him I promise. - Okay. - Dad? - Yes. - Do you know who God is? - No. - Did your mom and dad ever teach you about God? - I don't go to church anymore. - Do you believe that God loves everyone? - Yes. I believe God loves all his children. - No matter what? - My teacher taught me that we are all God's children, and God loves all his children. - Why does God make life so hard? Why do some people get enough food to eat, and a warm place to live? You know what I think? I think that when we die we get to live with God, and everyone will have a mom and a dad to take care of them, and have enough food to eat, and a warm place to sleep. - I think that too. [door closing] - Sorry. We'll find him mom. [traffic passing] [snoring] - Dad! Dad! Dad, wake up! Dad! I had a dream last night. I think it was from God. - It was a dream? - [Christine] Yeah. - What did he say? - He gave me a dream about how we can get a real Thanksgiving dinner. Okay, let's go!

Here's the turkey, and the mashed potatoes, and the gravy. You should always put gravy on your mashed potatoes, and on your turkey. Here's the stuffing, that's my favorite part. I like it when the top is burnt, it's so yummy when the top is crunchy and the bottom is soft. And the rolls, they're kind of smashed but they'll still be good. And I got real butter to put on the rolls. Oh no, oh no, no no no, I forgot to get us something to drink. We have to have eggnog. I love eggnog. - I love eggnog, too. - You do? Okay then, there's a little gas station with a little store in it. It's just down the street. You watch the food, and I'll be back in five minutes. Can you watch the food? - Yes, I can watch the food. - You sure? You won't run off, right? - No. - Okay. - Where could he be? - Mom, I don't know. I think we need to widen our search area. He's been gone a long time. - But there's still a chance that he could be close by. What if something bad has happened to him? - Well, in about an hour he will have been gone for 24 hours, and we can get the police involved. - Okay. We need to regroup. You guys must be starving. Let's go back to the house, get something to eat, and then we can get back to it. - Okay, sounds good. Jade, be good to grandma, okay? - Okay. - Just the eggnog? - Yeah, that'll be all. - It'll be 2.97. - Okay. - Excuse me sir, we're looking for our friend. - [Cashier] Out of five? - Yeah. - Have you seen him, his name is David. - I gotta go. - What about your change? - Hi, excuse me. - Yeah, I think I remember seeing him down at the old abandoned bridge. It's right around the corner, down the road, you can't miss it. - Okay, thank you. Let's go, we might find him. [tense orchestral music] - Someone's trying to find you. - Who's trying to find me? - They're from where you belong. - Don't I belong with you? - I wish you did but it's time for you to go home. You have to do what I say right now. You gotta go. - I don't want to go until we eat. - Dad, please. Help, help me! Help, help! Help me! - Did you hear that? - Yeah, I heard that. - Let's go check it out. [bright orchestral music] - Hi David, we've come to take you home. - Okay. - [Janice] Any luck? - Well, we saw this guy who said he saw someone that looked like Dad, but when we searched the area, no one had seen him. - Where was that? - By Promenade Park. - [Janice] Promenade Park? - Yeah, we checked the park, too, and didn't see him. I'm sorry Mom. - Okay, I'm gonna have to call the police station again, and file a missing person's report. - Grandpa! - Dad? - Oh my gosh. [dramatic orchestral music] - David, where have you been? I've been so worried about you. - Yeah, you really scared us, Dad. But it's okay, you're here now. Don't ever leave us again. - Grandpa, I missed you so much, I thought you were never gonna come back. What happened to your head? - It's a butterfly bandage. - Where have you been? - I don't know. - Well thank you boys for bringing him home, but do you know who was taking care of him? - No, he was by himself in a fort. - A fort. - Yeah, like a fort underneath a bridge. It was like somebody was trying to feed him. There was food. - Food? Who were you with, David? - My daughter. - Dad, I was right here. - Hey, what is this? - That's a necklace. - Well, where did you get it? - It was hers. She was making me dinner. And I didn't get to eat dinner, I'm still hungry. - You're hungry. Let's go in and get something to eat, okay? I didn't even start the turkey. But I can make you something. Would you like a ham sandwich? - [David] Yeah. - [Janice] Come on, we're almost there. [muffled speaking] [muffled conversation] - I smell turkey. - Yeah, it smells good. - I thought I heard you guys coming up from the walk. Here let me set the turkey down so we can eat. - That's beautiful. - Dad? Dad. I knew they'd find you. Dad, I'm so sorry I lost you. - I'm home. This is my home. - Yeah Dad, you're home. - Everything's all right now. - Yeah it is, Mom. Yeah. Let's eat. - Let's eat. - Jacob, I am seriously impressed, but since when do you cook? [laughing] - Holiday helper website. [laughing] - Of course. - They have meal preparation, and recipes, and comments to tell you when to start cookin'. Did you know that roasting a turkey upside down actually makes the meat more tender? - I do now. - Jacob, this is amazing. - Yeah but, I seriously can't believe that you did it, so. - What are we waiting for, let's eat. - Yes. - Oh I did screw up on one thing, I burnt the top of the stuffing. - That's okay. - What did you say, Dad? - I said it's okay. I like when it's burnt. You know how it's all crunchy and yummy on the top, and soft on the bottom. Now I hope that's real butter you got for the rolls Jacob. - Yeah, I got real butter for the rolls, Dad. - Nice. - Dad? - Honey, was that you? - Of course it's me, who'd you think it was? - Where have you been? - What do mean, where have I been? I've been right here. - Dad, you were sick. Don't you remember? - Well, I don't feel sick. And why is everybody acting so weird? - Dad, you weren't really here with us. Like, you weren't in the real world. - What does that mean, I wasn't in the real world? Of course I'm in the real world. - Dad, I'm glad you're back. - Okay. - Grandpa, I missed you. - Oh, I missed you too, I guess. - I don't know what all the fuss in about, but what I do know, is this meal is getting cold. Can we just eat, I'm starving. - Me too. - I love Thanksgiving. It is the best holiday meal of all, and I love you all. Jacob, would you offer us a prayer? - Yeah Dad, I'd love to. Lord, our Father in Heaven, our prayers have been answered today. Our family has been blessed, so blessed. We thank you for watching over our family, especially watching over our father. Thank you so much for bringing him back to us safe. We need our Dad. What would we do without him? This is truly a day of thanksgiving. Let us treat each other with kindness we all deserve, and help us be the light to others, and spread the love that we feel. In Jesus Christ, amen. - Amen. - [Jacob] Dad? - Here honey, let me help you. Here we go. - Thank you. - Jacob, would you please pass the mashed potatoes? - Yeah Mom, yeah. - Emily, would you like some mashed potatoes? - Yeah, sure Mom. - And Matthew, please pass the gravy. Jacob, could you carve the turkey, since you're the online chef, and assuming there's a video. - [Matthew Voiceover] For a brief moment, we all had what we desperately wanted, our father, and husband back, the way he was. It was wonderful, a moment never to be forgotten. But it didn't last. After Jacob's amazing prayer, Dad went back to being lost in Alzheimer's disease. [dramatic orchestral music] - Our father, the man who was sure and steady. The man who had his life and his future taken away from him too early. I don't think we'll ever forget what happened that Thanksgiving. Gosh, it was so good to see him as himself again, to hear that confident voice, and see that gleam in his eye. We had our dad back. We'll never know what happened during that 24 hours, or who was helping him. But wherever or whoever he was with, they sent something special back with Dad. Even though he couldn't communicate it in words, there was something different about him. That feeling that we felt in our home that day, that's something we've never felt before. His spirit touched us, and our family's never been the same. Being kind to each other was suddenly easy. Petty problems that once plagued us, drifted away. And what we saw as a disease, a problem that was a nuisance. It was just a different way of knowing a man we all loved. And I know that each one of us will always be grateful to that angel who became our father's keeper.
