How's that? They just fired you like that. I am just a nobody. You shouldn't get hurt like this. Got injured outside. They won't even compensate you. The world is just like that. What about next? Don't you worry. Take it slow. I say, Mami works hard. Gets up everyday on times. I want to go the factory and take a second look. How's the part-time job? It's done.

Why you got it fixed at that day? I know reasons are not important. No chance to give it back. No chance to give back to you. So gotta do something. Although I don't know what you mean. But thank you. Yes. OK. Then we will follow our own direction. Yes. Ah, Yabe what are you saying about the the drawings? Still drawing by Mabu right? No. We got a new illustrator. But Mabu is working on this since day one. A new excellent illustrator. Mabu is out-dated. He's slow, price's high, and he has no respect. These three are killing me. Wait..

Let me have a look, what are you drawing? - Enough man. - No. - What you mean no? - What, what? Just some works. Why are you so proud of having a job? I'm not proud. You look super-proud. Wait, where're you going? Is this OK, breaking into someone's house? No time to worry. The marketing guys are killing me. How could Mami draw things for you. Of course she could. This is the sketchbook. It's blank. What's this? It's good. But she already got hired. It's great. What did you do this week? Can't you see that she drew this during the week? Enough. Talk to me, why wouldn't you do that? Sorry. I don't need your sorry. Could you just finish it? I can't. Why? But why? I wanted to, but.. I only know how to imitate. Just draw whatever you want.

Wait a sec. Manager would you take a look at the import list? OK then. Do your own work. You could be a good manager at last. People will keep doing better. Like Mami. Let's say. I didn't know Mami was drawing. And keep drawing while staying at home. Didn't waste a sec. Because of that she draws so good? She has talent. Who gave her this talent? I have no idea. But the drawing thing's real. Just don't worry. You sound like that's all because of you. What have you done to help her? I'm her royal dad. The young folk from the game company called. Hi, thanks for contacting me, Yabe. Yes. What's that? What does it mean, refuse to draw? Mami? Dad Mom I heard. I told you that. I'm worried about you couldn't draw it well. And it happened. I don't think you have this special talent. Just forget it. Find a common part-time job. Hello? Your dad just don't know nothing. He said you're special. He's a just a run of mill guy, but he saying you're special. Just don't believe those nonsense. The world's full of this crap. When a man saying you're special. They're just lying. Understood? Are you there? Forget everything. Yes, know your limit. My limit.. Hello? Hello Mami? Sorry, gotta go. So good to see you. I always want to apologize since that day. Eh? You have no special relation with that guy right? Relation? I thought you two are getting together. If I going out with him, then you shoot me with guns? Yes, I will. It's complicated between us. Let's skip that part. What's your job? Nothing. Leech? I have a part-time job at game company. Then you're not leech but freelancer. Where do you live? You make me worry. But kinda special. You're funny. - Is that so? - En.. Well well, are you out of your mind again? You just said that you have better choice. Faster worker and cheaper, and no complaint. - I didn't say that. - You did. Everyone told me that. I did said that, I'm sorry. And who was my successor? Kubota? No. It's a girl. The drawings you refused, she fixed it all. That girl.. Because of that you thought she's having more experience? You're an oldbird already. Sorry. Thanks. Wait a sec. Your dad's worrying about you. I'm living at friend's house. You have friend now? We just met. Who's that? - I'm back. - Welcome back. I feel so good. I beat my client out of shite today. Trying to do some sexual harassment. You alright? Not my fault anyway, if they gonna fire me just do it. Just.. You need to just follow your own will. You draw for that man but now you can't draw anymore isn't it? Man. Come on, just forget that guy. Draw whenever you want. Don't need to care about someone else's opinion Alright. Ah. If you can do the cleaning you could stay here as long as you want. Why would I need to do that? You don't like cleaning? How about cooking? I know how to make fired eggs. Forget it. She sent me a massage said that she's staying at friend's home. Where is here? She said the same thing to me. Friend? Who's that? Who knows. She's improving, even made friends now. What's that guy doing? Thanks. Who's that? Mami's classmate since elementary school. She's always the one lagging. Call your own daughter lagging isn't good thing. Hey, you. Why not come here and drink together? Me? You standing there by your own, I can't bear to look at the image. Well.. - Hi. - Hi.

Sometimes you got fucked but I like my job. He's different. May I? Thanks. - Is there? - There.. OK.. Alright, arrived. Thank you. Don't thank me, it isn't finished yet. Let's take off your shoes. Great, and this. We're done. Who's that? You her friend? What a long road. It just exhausted like hell. You two know each other? Just acquaintance down at the bar. - I say, how do you thin' about that? - What? Come on. You're thinking me doing that thing. Let's talk it loud. I gotta dig her deep otherwise I wouldn't going this long way here. And now she's like this. Even if I don't care but she's like.. What the hell am I doing here! Who knows. - How about you? - How what? You just let me do it. So you're helping your friend. Why not just go back? Definitely going back once finished. Why not just stop running? This is expensive. You're not drunk now. I want to see what's going on. You're evil you know, pretending to be drunk and let your friend suffers. You're the one about to make her suffer, you're evil. I'm so tired, I have nothing going this far. You guys don't know that's a punchline? Give me a water? Shut the hell up and back your own home. Thank you, you're good-hearted. She's so good-hearted so people looking down at her. And teased her, she stays at home for a very long time. And keep staying? Now she isn't. I see. What's that? You're into these kind of girls? Of course not. Please help me out. - Are you free tomorrow? - And? Hello, I am.. - Are you Konuma Mami? - Yes. We're waiting for you, this way. Wait.. This way and straight. Here. Talk three: talking about the youngster - Hi. - Hi. Here we go. Come here. It's a miracle she's leaving home to here. - Hi everyone. - Hello. This is the third section talking today. We have Konuma Mami, 5-year home stayer. And she got it over with it. Over? Konuma will tell her own story. And sharing the key to solve it. I believe this talking will change everyone's similar problem. First of all, why were you staying at home? Eh.. Ah.. Well.. I was.. What do you want? What're you trying to do? Doing what? That's your house isn't it. Look at those weird stuff around here. What's the problem? Why you keeping her? Revenge on me? She had no place to go. So I let her stay. Are you hating me so much? How had I done? You know what you done. You lost you mind? Just skip my part. That job was a great chance for her, now you doing this? I don't think this is good. Chance? You just using her. Then why you let her stay at your place? I'm using her. She's cleaning house. You force her to do the cleaning? For the rental. I work at day, we both have our own world. Is that so? Unfortunately I have my own consideration. And? No idea, I might do some outrages things if this goes wrong, That's it, what're you gonna do? Longing to it. Which means. Konuma suddenly.. No longer a home-stayer and leech. She became a freelancer. That's right. Please. I wanna know.. Why you chose that first job, working at the mechanic factory? Well, that's a job without speaking. 也就是 循序渐进地融入社会 That's her meaning. How could you left home.. I mean what was the reason that put you out of your house? Reason? Ah, my dad was fired. Stayed at home for long. It was weird at home. So I left and found the job. Well, that means.. Using father-at-home as a chance, you had to do some job to support your dad.. That was your thought right? Any other questions? - Next. - Here. What is that? Actually.. I didn't overcome anything. But now you have a job. And you're talking in public like this. Which means you're already cool with it. Now you're drawing which you love. I can't. Can't what? If someone makes me to draw, I can't draw at all. If someone says that I can draw whatever I want.. I can't draw it too. I'm just some home-stayer and lagger. You give it to me? Thanks. In busy. Well then. Are those your drawings? Just keep drawing, then we show them to the world. Right, I know somebody. Boss of a design company, Yanagita. This guy knows guys. We just let him have a look. He gotta be surprised. You scared me. Well well. We will meet Yanagita the day after. We take the drawings together. What's up? It's gone? What's gone? Sketchbook. It was just there. And disappeared? It must be taken by someone. I know who took it. Son of a bitch. Let's go, we will get it back tomorrow. I'm sorry, who are you guys? What's going on? Move on. Go away. What's that? - Give it back. - What? Don't act dumb. You gotta shoot. I'm fine. What do you mean? Her sketchbook. sketchbook, what's that? I really don't know nothing. Where were you at 3 pm yesterday? 3? I was in a meeting. Lying. I didn't. - Is that right. - Yeah. I swear it's true, just ask around. - No one fooling me? - No, we was in a meeting since 2:30 pm. I told you. - So what happened? - I don't know either. Really? Why do you think I'm the thief? But you just followed her on Twitter. Yes. This is Mami's dad. Her classmate Hiroki. And this? No idea. I think someone tracked her location through Twitter. And took her sketchbook. Which means, the culprit is among these three? Why are you thinking that's me? It's so noisy. You turned here upside down, you want me to get fired? I did had that idea.. You're so stubborn, because of some small thing. Some small thing? What did Yabe do? Nothing. He had a trash-game called My-Ex. And he put my poem in that game. Poem? Is that poem.. Listen to my poem you will have gift Listen/Refuse My heart is a red ballon My love is twisting rubber-on Ballon and rubber-on is so similar The loving you and the disgusting me. Next Listen/Refuse That's from my notebook from high school. You used my embarrassing thing as entertainment. I thought that was funny. Don't you laugh at me! Sorry. If that's all, we get back to work. What do you mean that's all? What do you want me to do? Put an end to it. Put an end to what? Erika you're always like that. Like what? I forgot your b-day gift and you keep mentioning that. That's because you mixed up my b-day with the White Day. All my fault then? Come one, just shoot me dead. You said that, I will pull the trigger. Just pull the trigger. What're you doing out there, come on in. We haven't met in a long time. The things you said on phone.. I have no idea, what sketchbook is? Give it back. Couldn't find it. You said I took it? Look. That's me. That's the proof that I took your sketchbook? Is that it? Leave me alone. If Mom leaves you alone, who's caring you then? Why I became like this.. are all because of you. Because of me? You always against the things I wanted to do. Against? How could that be? I wanted to learn piano at elementary school. And wanted to go to private high school. Those are just excuses. All because Mami have no confidence in yourself. So I said why not just give up? All things you've done are failed isn't it? Failed? Look back at your life. Is there anything you done are successful? But I always care about you. Take it. Hi it's me. I know who took your sketchbook. A Mabu guy. He got envy of you and you took his job. What a small man. No that's not it. Just doing some personal checking on her skills. Truly sorry. Don't worry, we will keep it safe. Well, see you then. How's that? Ah.. Sketchbook has been found. And? Treating innocent person as criminal.. You need to make a good apology. I'm Sorry.. I'm Sorry.. I'm Sorry.. I know. I'm Sorry.. Come down and sit. Your drawing talent is not coming from your parents. That's your own talent, all by yourself. But you're blaming me for your staying at home. Talent. Isn't it? You're good at drawing right? But your dad and I both have no drawing DNA. It was a gift. Having talent is good. Mom haven't seen any of your drawings yet. I have an idea. Why not move in my house? Instead of living by your own, How about living together? You shouldn't be living without mom. That's good. Just move in. Thank you. For what? For everything. What're you doing, looks like a farewell. Manager, look at that cripple. Excuse me, Napoletana pasta. Napoletana pasta should mine. - Sorry. - This is not Napoletana at all. I'm sorry for that.. No problem. I'm sorry, it's coming.. He will got better. There. That's all I want. Thank you for that. OK. We're here to visit you. Working hard aren't you. Thank you. Konuma. Could you draw the line for me? OK. And, this place. How about adding two piece of Idiot Hair? I think one's enough. Well, do what you want. Mabu your next job.. I think that guy couldn't live without you. is this. Don't be a assistant at this place. Going solo. It's fine. Why? Step by step. Is that so? We're also going step by step. You numby. From now today the world belongs to you.
