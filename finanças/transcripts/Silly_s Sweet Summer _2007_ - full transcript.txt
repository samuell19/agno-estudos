SILLY'S SWEET SUMMER Based on the book by Thomas Schmid Martin! Martin! Come downstairs, please! Okay! Directed by Johannes Schmid Well, I hope we'll be good neighbors. - Yes, good neighbors... Sanne, the sofa... - Excuse me. The sofa... straight ahead to the living room and past the table. Careful! Martin, come here. Come here. Here are Mr. and Mrs. Mayland, our new neighbors. And this is our son Martin. We don't have any children. Yes. None of the neighbors have any children. We are all happily retired. Martin is the shy type, just like his father. - Right, you two? - Yeah... Here's my wallet with the grocery list. Can you find the little shop...? - Mom! - Sanne! Okay... Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Ah! It's Oliver Huber. Don't mess everything up and leave without buying anything! And tell your father to pay his debts! This is no welfare office! Blah, blah, blah! This stuff is absolutely uncool, K?rner! He's swiping something! - I knew it! - Don't touch me, K?rner! This time I'm telling your father! Now get out of here! Just you wait! Well done. Stay away from Huber, you hear? Who's that for? - My mother. - Ah! Hey, Martin. It won't be that bad. - The school's okay. - Knowing her, she checked it over well. Yes, I did. After all, I'll be working there myself next fall. Stop it! Oh, Martin! It isn't easy for you, but going back to work again means a lot to me. I'm not complaining. - Want me to take you? - Leave him alone! Okay, I was just asking. What's the rush? Tattling on somebody, champion? - Listen, I... - Give me that silly cap! - You're no champion! - Leave me alone! - Don't get smart, asshole! - What's going on, Olli? Private matter. Come on! What's he got against you? - No idea. - What do you mean? You see, not long ago I punched him in the nose. Sure thing. I could've knocked him down again. Let me guess. A left jab to his body and a right hook to his chin. Exactly. But I swore only to do that to guys who are an even match. - Cool story. So what's the real story? Uh... who cares anyway? - You know where Class 6b is? - Maybe. Maybe not. Who cares anyway? - Hi. - Hi. - It's the new guy. - Sweet. How old is he? - Is this seat taken? - Sorry, it's Oliver's seat. Get lost! You must be the new boy. Sit down here in front. - Hello. - Hi. Quiet, ladies and gentlemen! Quiet! You have a new classmate. Would you introduce yourself, please. His name is Silly Cap. Cap is his last name, and Silly is his first name. Come on. Or is Huber right? I'm Martin, Martin Kreitmeier. Okay, Kreitmeier. Get this into your head: - Don't wear your silly cap in class. - No problem with a big head like that! And you, Oliver Huber, keep your mouth shut! The school year is almost over, and you know you aren't a student of high standing. Actually I'm sitting now. Konrad, write your results on the board. Don't make me squeeze everything out of you. What are your classmates like? No idea. How should I know what they're like? Martin, try to make friends this time, okay? Yes, Mom! Come on, Martin. Sometimes you're worse than your father! Here, put them away neatly. What's that for? Lotion for my skin. I'm going biking... in the sun. To keep from getting sunburned. I see. But put your clothes away first, so they don't get greasy. And don't forget your helmet! Hey, Silly Cap! Playing Lord Helmet today? See you around, wimp! No way, man! - What's this all about? - Silke! Silly Cap here actually tried to catch up with me! - Come on, let's go. - Where to? Riverpool. - Riverpool? - None of your fucking business! See you around. You know, I'd leave a little more space. What do you say, Herbert honey? Yes, Mommy. As you wish. What do you think? What species could it be? I'd say, he's a dwarf carp, and she's a piranha. Yeah, but... she has false teeth. - Are you two coming? - Yes. I'm staying here. - Building supplies stores are boring. - Okay. - You're right. - Make me some coffee, Mommy. Okay. - But we have to get on with this. - Don't get eaten up. Girls! Would you try to concentrate! We perform a week from now, but you dance like a herd of cows on ice! Now once again from the beginning! Five, six, seven and one... two, three, four, five, six, seven... One, two, three, four and... turn, turn, turn, hop, turn, turn, turn, hop. Five, six, seven and one, two, three... What's the problem this time? So what's up? - I didn't want to bother you. - No idea who's your girlfriend, but you'll have to wait a bit! Okay. Outside, okay? Huh? Let's go! Once more! Damn it! - I could never do that. - Try again when I'm finished. - What's that? - I got it from Dad. - Where are you going? - To the caf?. But it's Saturday. I thought we could go on a little outing. I took over Irina's shift. I see. - I have to work to make ends meet. - You mean, I don't make ends meet. I'm fed up with your self-pity! I can't stand it anymore! Shut up! You think another beer will make things better? And that expensive gift! You know we haven't paid the rent yet! If I want to give my son a present, I don't have to ask you! Bye! Come on, it was so embarrassing. Really! I bet he's sitting at home, totally ashamed. Look over there. He isn't at home. - Go ahead. I'll catch up. - Who knows what you see in him. - When I find out, I'll let you know. - Okay, ciao, ciao. Not that you think... What happened in there was... I didn't want to... - I was bored. - Mmh. And Bellbach is dead on the weekend. So I took a little bike ride. - And you just happened to come by here. - Exactly. - Does it look good on me? - I guess so. My father got it for me in America. - I don't have a father. - What do you mean? My parents separated. Dad lives in the city now. Kathrin is now a "single parent." "Champion." Can you show me the sights of Bellbach? - After all, I'm new here. - I get it. But you said yourself the town is dead. What about Riverpool? Okay, if you like. Will you pick me up tomorrow at two? Sure. And bring your swimming trunks. You can swim, can't you? - Okay, tomorrow at two. - Bye. Ready to go? - Hey, sweetheart. Going out? - Martin and I are going to Riverpool. I'm Kathrin. So you found the gymnasium, huh? Uh... yes. Thanks a lot. - A sweet boy. - Mom! Good night. Good night? She had the early shift at the hospital. Come on. Come on! - Kathrin speaking. - Hi, Ms. Ohlmann. Hey, Oliver. You know I always sleep at this hour. Yeah, sorry. I forgot. Is Silke there? No, she's at Riverpool, I think. Thanks. Okay. Okay, bye. Welcome to Riverpool. NO SWIMMING - Thank goodness. - What? Thank goodness we can't swim here, 'cause I forgot my trunks. Nonsense! The water's terrific! Cool, isn't it? We can cross to the other side. Do you guys often come here? Sure. Silke? - Can't you knock first? - Sorry. Back then... ...at your old school... did you ever... - Did you ever kiss anybody? - Are you nuts? Want some sun lotion? You know, the ozone layer and all that. - Nowadays you really need to take care. - Thanks, Mr. Smarty Pants. Want to put it on me? Sure thing. You can't stand Olli, can you? He can't stand me either. Olli isn't really like he seems. He just puts on a big show. Are you and Oliver friends? I mean girlfriend and boyfriend? A little bit. Shit, Silke! What's Silly Cap doing here? - Hi, Oliver. - Hey... Damn it! This is our spot! - Stay cool! - Traitor! Ouch! Leave her alone! Are you crazy? Stop it! Break it up! Knock it off! Stop it! You fell off your bike? How did that happen? Uh... - There was a huge hole in the road. - What about your helmet? Fortunately, it wasn't "injured." This is going to hurt. You never used to do things without me! Nothing is like it used to be! Silke. I can't leave now. For Oliver's sake... Sure, it'd be nice, Armin. Sure... I feel the same. I have to hang up, Armin. See you tomorrow. Oliver? Oliver, are you asleep? ANOTHER 5 MINUTES - What's going on, Kreitmeier? - Gotta go to the toilet! Nice Band-aid. Yours isn't bad either. Silke's sulking. Kreitmeier? There you are! Everything okay? - Smells like smoke. - I don't smell a thing. What do we have here? I'd say it's a corpus delicti. Huber, Huber! Why is it always you? The two of us are going to see the principal. I believe it will be your last rebuke, at least at this school. But Mr. Altmann...! It's none of your business, Kreitmeier! Yes, it is, because... - Because what? - I was the one who smoked. - But I didn't! - Really? Then why the rebuke? Once again. I don't quite understand. You said you smoked, but you didn't. - I didn't want Oliver to get a rebuke. - Oliver? What Oliver? He already has two rebukes. It isn't fair to expel him for one cigarette. What kind of friends do you have? We'll go to school now, and you'll tell Principal Schneider what happened. You know I start teaching there next fall. - No, way! I'm no tattle-tale! - It has nothing to do with that. - Just tell the truth. - No way! - You just don't want to feel ashamed! - Stay here! Calm down. You two stick together like always! Do you have any idea what schools are like now? You sit there programming all day. You have no idea what goes on there! Maybe it's just a cigarette now, but... what comes next? Alcohol? Drugs? Wake up, Uwe! It's time you woke up! You can't protect your son from everything! Hey, Sanne. Martin is no longer a baby. And if he wants to help Oliver, it's his own decision. What do we do now? Now? We sign this paper. Tayfun. Markus. - Silly Cap! - Hey, Olli! My name is Martin. Alex. Martin, you have a visitor. Upstairs and... Hi. Does my room look better in orange? No, not too bad. I'm not mad anymore. It isn't my problem if you two act like little kids. Hey, are you as glad to see me as your master is? What are those spots? - Darn it. That's the spot disease. - A disease? It looks really cool. It's really dangerous. If it spreads... What kind of fish is this? Your mermaid? Give me that! I pasted it on when I was little and forgot to take it off. I was just kidding. I have a big poster of Tommy Baxter. But he's dressed. Yeah. Unfortunately. - We can go to the movies in the city. - Cool. Olli can come, too. Olli? - Hi, Mr. Huber. Is Olli home? - Oliver, here's a lady for you. He'll be right here. Hi. - Hey, we're taking you to the movies. - No, thanks. - Hi, Silke. Long time no see. - Hi. We're going to the movies. A good idea with weather like this. - Here. - No, Mom. I'm staying... Don't be so silly! Hey, want to smoke, you super hero? No, I don't smoke. But you're still a hero. There's no rebuke you can't handle. I think it's great you did that for Olli. Yeah, you were terrific, Silly. Hey, does he get one today? It's Twitcher. He's a bit... What's the magic word? - Chewing gum, please. - Exactly. Thank you. - In English it's "tank you." - "Tank" you! - Darn it. It's for 16 and over. - I'd rather see "Because of You." Come on, I'll manage it. 3 tickets for "Roboclone," please. Can I see your IDs? - Oh, shit. Our IDs... - We're studying the topic at school. Cloning and all. And our Biology teacher told us to watch the movie, - 'cause it's part of the curriculum. - Your IDs. Our IDs! We don't have them with us... 'cause you know how easily they can get stolen. Right. Think of Germany's test results. Do you want us to get bad grades? No way, you clowns! - Okay. 3 for "Because of You," please. - Okay. - Emily, wait, please. - Let go, Frank. No, I won't let you go. Never again. - Oh man, this is so... - Shh. Frank, you have to go. Daniel loves me. I'm going to marry him tomorrow. Emily, you're the most important woman in my life. Ever since I saw you, you're all I can think of. What're we going to do now? - Let's have some cake. - Cake? We always do it after the movies. It's free at the Adler Caf?. Olli's mom works there part-time. - I need to be home by seven. - To Mommy! We can take the next train. - Or we can go alone, Silly. - Okay, I'm coming. - What's that? - Raspberry and marzipan. - I see. It looks really delicious. - It tastes good, too. - And what's that? - Prince Regent cake. That looks yummy, too. And that's cream-filled crunch cake. I don't know why it's so difficult. Hey, Olli. Look! I want you. Only you. Please... Stop it, Olli. Hey, that's your mother. That isn't my mother. She's off work today. - But she looks just like... - Shut up, Silly Cap! What a difficult decision! First I wanted the crunch cake, although it's much too sweet. Then I wanted apple crumble, but I had it last time. What's the problem now? Are you hassling each other again? No, it's okay. - Hi. - Do you know what time it is? Martin! I kind of lost track of time. We were very worried. Sanne kept trying to reach your cell, but it was off. Sorry, I was at the movies with Silke and Olli and forgot to turn it on again. Olli? Not Olli with the cigarette? No, another Olli. Don't lie to us! You're grounded for a week. And I won't let you go out with Oliver again! Dad? You know what's important to us. "That we can trust each other." That's right, Martin. Sanne found this... in your pants pocket. Things will be run very differently if you start lying. Go to your room! - But... - Didn't you understand what I said? Yes. Are you going somewhere? Your father fell asleep in the living room. Tell him I'm spending a few days with a girlfriend. You know how he reacts. It's just for a few days. Dinner's in the kitchen. See you... my little guy. You call this "grounded"? My guards let me out. They thought I could do with fresh air. Ah, you got a luxury prison here. Coming to the hospital with me on Saturday? Hospital? The summer party. Our dance group is performing. I don't know. Dad's coming, too. I haven't seen him for ages. You can just sneak out. Hey, what was wrong with Olli yesterday? He was suddenly so strange. No idea. Why? It was probably because of his parents again. They're always fighting about being broke and all. Speaking of parents, I have to go. Kathrin's home early today. Saturday's okay, isn't it? Hey, Dad... - Yes? Don't you think it's kind of old-fashioned to ground a child? Forget it. - Oh, Dad! Silke's performing with her dance group on Saturday. Silke? Oh. You really seem to like her, don't you? - Dad! I was just asking. Promise you'll stop smoking? - I didn't... I promise. Okay. - Really? I'm not grounded anymore? No. You're right. It is a bit old-fashioned. The Dark Age. Hey, Silly Martin! No longer grounded? Is Silke here, too? - See her anywhere? Nope. Then I guess she isn't here. You gotta make do with me. Come on. The water's great. Are you chicken? - No, I leave water to the fish. If evolution had wanted us to swim, we'd have fins. Oh, Silly Cap! Feel like a boat ride? Or are you scared of that, too? Are you going to the summer party on Saturday? Boring. All they do is get drunk. Aren't you going? Silke asked me, too, but I don't think so. Silke... Is she going steady with you? - Are you nuts? No, we're only good pals. It's enough if you're in love with her. Nonsense. I'm not in love. I just wanted to know. Go on. Hey... Ever kissed anybody? With tongues or a simple kiss? No, of course not. What about you? Me neither. How did you escape? With a rope ladder? Or did you dig a tunnel? I was released early on good conduct. - I see. I kept wondering why prison clothes are now orange. Hey, have you ever... Have you ever kissed anybody? Maybe. Maybe not. Forget it. It was a silly question. Hey, nice earrings. From Olli. - Adler Caf?. - Hello. Can I talk to Mrs. Huber? Just a moment. Vera! Telephone! Hello? Hello? Is anybody there? Hello? Oliver, is that you? Hey, kids. Everything okay? Dad's coming for sure? - He wouldn't miss his daughter's show. At least, I hope he doesn't. Ah, there they are. Corinna! - Hi there! Yes? - Hi, Martin. It's me. Olli, hi. Feel like going to Riverpool? It's a drag to go there alone. I can't right now. I'm out with my dad. At the carwash. Okay. Bye. Bye. What do you mean he can't come? He promised! - You know how much he has to do. He asked your little brother and me to give you this. Thanks. "He's so sorry he can't come." Stupid bitch. Is this your father? He looks really nice. Kathrin just acts like she and Corinna are best friends. It's a great present. My grandpa had one like it. Cheese! - Cut it out! Here, look... Silke, I... Are you crazy? What's the big idea? Asshole! Silke! It's time things started jumping here! - What the hell, Dad! Come on! - Leave me alone! I'm having fun. - Fun? Are you crazy? Just let me drink my beer in peace, okay? Good night. - Sleep tight, Martin. Oh, Martin. They're sick. There's nothing you can do. It happens. We can buy new ones. - I know. Or does it have to do with Silke? What happened? - Nothing. Everything's okay. Okay? No matter what happened, everything can be straightened out. Women are sometimes complicated. Just ask Uwe. You're my champion. Good night. Good night, dear. What a champion! Maybe the champion loser! I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry. Honest. Can't we make up again? And at least be friends? Please. It's pretty hot today, isn't it? I have two ice creams. Maybe you'd like one. I'll put it on the fence. You can come and take it if you like. Or forget it. Can't you read, young man? It says: "No Advertisements." Sorry. That's all right. Ah, so this is where Silly Cap lives. I'm sorry I lied to you, Olli. I didn't want to... - Not my problem. Hey, if you need a friend... A friend like you? What for? Maybe 'cause your life's a mess, too. When we were at the caf?, that was your mother... - None of your business! Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I didn't mean to... Pretty thirsty, huh? - None of your business! I don't understand it, Dad. Why don't you just go and talk to her? Or to that baker asshole? - What good would it do? That wouldn't win Vera back. But that would? Coward! - Watch out what you say! You're a drunk and a coward! I'm getting out of here! Just like Mom! I'm going to leave you here alone! Damn bike! Martin! Martin! Can I come upstairs? - Shh! My parents! Wait a sec. I'll be down. I'm never going home again. - Okay, but be quiet. I'm going to throw up. You look like shit. Martin? What's going on here? Who are you? Hello, Mrs. Kreitmeier. I'm Oliver. Say, are you drunk? Uwe, this is Oliver. We have to call his parents. What's your parents' number? I'm getting out of here! - Olli, wait! Hey, you're staying here! - But Dad! - No buts! Hey, you haven't had breakfast yet! What's up, huh? I need to talk to Silke. - She isn't interested. Just knock it off, Silke! What do you want me to do? Go on... So, what's up? We need to find Olli. There's Olli's bike! Olli! Olli, are you here? Olli, where are you? - Olli! Damn it! The raft is gone! He must be on the other side! Come on, we'll swim across! Hurry! - I can't swim properly! What? I don't believe it! I've always been scared of water. - It isn't deep. You can do it. Olli, wake up! What happened, Olli? Come on, tell us. We want to help you. - Leave me alone! No, we won't! You can't just lie around here! You think we're going to watch you get messed up? Tell us what's going on, please! Mom left for good. Dad drove her out of the house. Oh shit! What happened to you guys? A wet T-shirt contest. I guess I lost. You can sleep at my place. For longer if you like. Great! What'll your parents say? - I'll talk to them. See? Come on. Let's go to your place and get some fresh clothes. I bet he's still asleep. Go in and get my things. I don't want to see him. Okay. Come on, Martin! Help me! I'll call an ambulance! Martin Kreitmeier speaking. 9 Cranach Street. Hurry. We have a man who's unconscious! Hurry! Why won't they tell me what's wrong? - They're still examining him. You're Oliver Huber? - Yes. Your father had a heart attack, but he'll make it. Can I see him? - No, he's still asleep. Tomorrow. We'll take good care of him. Oliver is staying with us for a few days. I beg your pardon! What happened to you two? Can't we talk it over beforehand? I thought it was important for us to trust each other. Can't you fall asleep either? I'm so damn scared. About Dad. And about Mom. Yeah, about her, too. And I'm scared about myself. That I'll turn out like my father. It's all so damn complicated. You're a great guy, Martin. Oliver, we're very sorry that we were so impolite... I think we have to go now. Looks good on him, doesn't it? - Bye! - Bye! - Bye! See you, guys. Take care. Hello, Oliver. Hey, can't we... Oliver? How's he doing? - Better. We were really lucky you found him in time. I talked to your father, and we agreed. You'll come and stay with Armin and me, okay? Armin is really looking forward to you... Okay? Your father has to learn to live with himself first. We'll be waiting downstairs for you. Your mother was here. She wants a divorce. She wants you to live with her and that confectioner. I already know, Dad. Don't worry, I'll get by. I'd rather stay with you. No idea how things will turn out. He never used to be like that. He said he's going to stop drinking. He's going to do "rehab." Hey, what's up? I thought you didn't smoke. I don't. I bought them for you. The first time I saw you at the store. - Hey, they're historical. You bet. Confiscated by my parents and heroically rescued by me. Thanks. I will save them. I need to tell you something, too. You see... When I said I'd never kissed a girl... That was a lie. Silke. I kissed Silke. Or she kissed me. Or we kissed each other. But it was no big deal. FRIENDS? And just so you know... I hate strawberry ice cream. FRIENDS? Come on, Silly! Don't be chicken! Is it really necessary? We won't let you drown! Hurry up and get in! Hey, that isn't fair! Okay, you asked for it! Subtitles John R. Middleton Film und Video Untertitelung Gerhard Lehmann AG extracted and formatted by rogard
