Soon he will see that holy city, see it with his own eyes, He'll come back and tell us about the place where our dream lies. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem you are our only destiny you are our destiny. you are our destiny. Come. Mrs.? Are you a Hebrew woman? Are you a Hebrew woman? From our Lord's chosen people? I've always wanted to meet a Hebrew from the Holy Land. We read about you a lot, in our Bible. James. This story about the Holy Land, I heard maybe 300,000 times. I know you came here to make money. Make money? Send security in. Why not go to work in America, Germany, France? We barely get by in this God forsaken place... Sir! Sir! Sir! Please listen to me. This is a big mistake. I'm on my way to Jerusalem. I'm a messenger. Why you... Hey! -Quiet! - Hey! Be quiet. Go back to your place, fast. Sit down and be quiet! Quickly! All of this is Romania. I live in Bucharest. Here is Manilla. The city of Manilla, yes? This is Palawan. -Palawan. My Father, please hear me. For you I have left the village on this journey. Do not forsake me in the desert, Father. Hear my voice Father. Help me. Send me salvation... Up, up, everybody up. The Messiah is here. What about this Romanian? - No Ezra, I have enough of them... Shimi, we don't have all night. Nathan will be back soon. Excuse me, sir. Why have they put me in here? Am I a criminal? Am I an animal? - Oh. His English isn't bad! Bible? Good book, eh? I bet you don't drink too much. This one? He looks weird. Ezra, I can tell by their eyes. He looks like a good guy. Come on, let's go. Open up. Come out, you're the winner. - Come on. Thank you, sir. Good luck, Shimi. - Thanks. -How's Dad? Thank God he's well, and driving us crazy. Let's rush the paperwork, my wife is waiting in the car... Am I keeping you? - Let's go, my friend. What's his name? James. He's cute. Good people. You saved me, and I will not forget it. When you come to Entshongweni I will be able to return the favor. Where are we going? Jerusalem? Jerusalem, yes, Jerusalem! Jerusalem of gold!... Feda! Hi, everybody. Everything OK? Where's Feda? Feda! - Feda! Come. Come. Feda! Hello my friends. What's cooking? Hello, boss. Mr. Shimi. Good food? Last week it was better. James, this is Feda, he's the boss here. In charge of the apartment. Have him sign for his gear and give him dinner, OK.? Why do you bring another African here? I don't know... Never mind. Good night, everybody. Excuse me, sir. -Yeah. - What is this place? Here you live. -Me? - Tomorrow you begin to work. 500 Dollars a month if you are OK. Don't worry, Feda will explain everything. I have to go now, my wife is waiting in the car. O.K? Good night. Good luck. Good night boys. Sweet dreams. But sir, wait, sir. - What? I'm on my way to Jerusalem. I thank you for your hospitality. Don't be a smart ass, OK.? I just took you out from prison. Don't make me regret it. Understand? What's the matter, boss? - I don't know, he was fine till now. He wants more money? Like in Africa? -Sir... I don't understand this... Understand what? Understand what? You just got here and already You're talk about vacation? Sir, wait! Sir! Sit! Brother, why the festive clothing? Where are you coming from? Skomboze, you mouse. Tell to this antelope tell in your language: Feda's no "frayer", understand? All things here is mine. Let me see what you have there. - Leave it alone. Leave it! I'll give it back, you idiot. What do you speak? Zulu. Welcome, village boy. I am Shagan, but I speak some Zulu. That ape is the biggest problem here. He takes money for everything and keeps bugging: "Skomboze do this, "Skomboze do that!" He won't even let us watch their television. If you go and sit over there, He'll ask you for 10 shekels. Are we far from Jerusalem? I'm here for 6 years, and I haven't been there yet. 6 years? What have you been doing here so long? -Mostly "gummi". "Gummi"? "Gummi" (cleaning). Don't worry, You'll get used to it. Good morning Tzvika. -You ass, why not come in the afternoon? Come on, it's the traffic... - Tell him to start here. Come on, move it, Tzvika is waiting. I want my passport. What? -I want my passport that you took yesterday. Tzvika, we'll be right with you. Tell me, do I look like a "frayer"? Ah? What did you come here for? To make money or make me problems? I already told you sir. This is a mistake. I'm not here for money. I'm a pilgrim in the name of my village. Pilgrim. - Yes. As in Holy Land? Bible? So now you can give me my passport? So now you can give me my money? I owe you money? - I owe you money? You in jail? Shimi pay money? You out jail? Bail! Does that ring a bell? Now no more mistakes! You have two choices: Or you begin now to work, Or I'll put you again in prison, and I'll take somebody else and you go back to Africa. Decide now! Well, what will it be? All right sir. If I owe you money, I'll work for you. And then I'll go to Jerusalem. Good. On Sunday, I go to church. Church here on Saturday. Take off the dress and get busy. Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem - you are our destiny. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem - you are our destiny. We have no fear Zion, Your light shall guide us on our journey. How much longer shall we wait, before we enter thy gates, Oh Jerusalem... Jerusalem, Jerusalem Jerusalem - you are our destiny. You are our destiny... Please have your seats. Thank you, that was good. Everybody did very well. My children, we want to thank God for his goodness. And this morning, as I look at my flock, I see a young man that God has brought into this congregation. Young man, please stand up. Let us see you. Young man, what's your name and where do you come from? My name is James, and I come from Entshongweni. I am to be the next pastor of the village. A pastor? What has brought you here? Our Lord has given me a test, It is my fate to have a debt to a man here, but as soon as he releases me, I'll continue on my journey to Jerusalem, and then return to my village. You're a nice and honest young man. And the Lord will help you on your journey and show you the way. Amen. - Amen! Nice to meet you, nice to meet you. Good morning, Dad. What's this? That Thai cleaned here last week. What now? Come on, Dad! Spare me, I'm in the middle of work. Doesn't the house need cleaning? Dad! I come from the above... I come from the other side. I come from the above... I come from the other side. Sing, sing! You're better than that Thai, that's for sure. Right? He's alright isn't he? Is that your wife, Mr.? - Work, work! And don't do it "hafif" (a sloppy job)! What do you do over in Africa? I'm a farmer. - A farmer? A farmer. Hey! OK, that's enough. Put that away and come with me. I haven't finished, this is "hafif"... I say when it's "hafif"! Come! Put down the chair, the Backgammon goes here. We're done with the house. Now we fix up the garden. What a garden I used to have here. Once the children are gone, everything's gone. There were apples, avocados, lemons. Here there was a mint bush, a meter high. Now they want to sell the land and build another one of those. What, what? They make big houses here in the holy land. That's shit, not a house. It's like the projects: It costs lots of money and isn't worth a thing. Your boss and his wife, want to stuff me into a box like that. But they won't get my signature, even from my grave! Do you hear me? Why are you standing there? Get busy. I want everything to be green here. You understand? Green everywhere. Understand? What's wrong, what "hafif"? What are you talking about? Everybody is happy with Shimi's people. Don't piss me off! What do you mean you won't pay? You won't pay Shimi? Really? I'll tell you something. - What? If I tell them back in the village how this place is, they won't believe me. They'll be mad at me. Why? It must be different in Jerusalem. I'm sure it is... Hi Everybody. Where's Feda? Feda! Come on boys, get moving, My wife is waiting in the car. Work well, get paid well. But if you're lazy, I go crazy. Sebastian. Sign here. OK. Thank you very much, boss. And now, Charles... There you go! - Thank you, boss. David! David, bonus. Work well, get paid well. Wait a minute! Sign here. Slow down boys, there's enough for everyone. Here Djiga, and this is from Shimi. A bonus. -Thank you. Here Skomboze! - Thanks boss. Oh James... Here. Now you are the millionaire of your village. Mr. Shimi... - What? Our Lord said: "It is easier for a camel to go through the hole of the needle- "than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God!" I don't need your money. Please, take it for what I owe you and let me go to Jerusalem. Why don't you go and mount the cross, Jesus?! It's OK boss. Forget about Jerusalem, I'll take you somewhere better. Give it to the poor, for all I care. Jesus, king of the jungle. - Playing Jesus with me... Where are we going brother? - You'll soon see. Soon you'll see it all. As it is written, "A land flowing with milk and honey". I come from the above, I come from the other side. I come from the above...-5 and 4. It fell... What can I do? Here. Put it here. Do it for me, I can't get up. Great. Very good. Come... Come. Pick it up. Hurry up, it fell, I was winning. Come on. How do you know that? How did you do that? I watch you all day, Mr. Salah. Like this and like that... Really... So get a chair, sit down. A chair, a chair. Come on already! Sit down and play. You're black, I'm white. Like in life. We throw the dice. It's a game of chance, you have to move yours here, and I move mine here. If you win, I'll give you 10 shekels. If I win, I'll deduct it from your wages. Now throw the dice! Go on! Bastard. Damn your father. A double 6. That's how. 5 and 2. Go on. How did you do that? Lucky bastard, you devil. Now I'll be showing you who Salah is. Damn your father, Mr. Salah. Be quiet! That's no way to talk to your boss! Back to work! I said back to work! No playing around with Salah. Who does he thinks he is! 5 and 4. 5 and 6. James, James, dear James. 2, 3, 4... 5, 6, 8... 10, 11... 16, 18, 20... Here, James. And here's a bonus, for working so well. Why? - Come on, Feda. Even Dad is happy. Thank you, Mr. Shimi, thank you. Skomboze is a different story, eh? I hear you don't get up on time for work, Mr. Skomboze. Not true, Mr. Shimi. Skomboze works well. You call me a liar? - No, never. So my clients are liars? I wake up in the morning, like everybody else. Ask James. Tell him, so he won't cut my pay. -Wow. Quiet! Skomboze wakes up with me. OK. I'm paying you... But I'll keep 100 shekels. As a warning. Remember, if you lose your way, you will pay, eh! It says "thou shall not lie". Why did you make me lie? Why did you make me lie to him Skomboze? Tell me, are you a Reverend or something? Are you a Reverend? What do you care about him? We're his "frayers", that's all! He makes enough off our backs. Give me a break, James. The red one. The red one. The red one. Reverend! - What, Mr. Salah? Come here, come stand over here. - What? It's very important. Run! Pessach, see my right hand? It's a goner... The doctor said: "Salah, this hand is 'kaput"". I said: "Herr Doctor, I wouldn't throw dice with my left hand, "even if my own father, came to me in my dream and told me to." So what did my son do? Eh? What did he do? He brought me this blackie to throw instead of me. Do you mind? Why should I mind, Salah? You just live and be well. OK, let's play, for fifty. Why fifty? It's a waste of time. Why not a hundred? If you insist. Come here. Play. - What? Throw, throw. - Me? -Yes. Throw! What do you say... - 6 and 6. 2 and 1... Tough Luck. - Here. Throw. Again, don't worry about it. Throw them. Move it! Damn your father! - Don't curse. Don't curse him. He's a Reverend. He came here for his village. All he thinks about is the Bible and work. He's a real Zionist. Like in the good old days... Go on, Reverend, go for it. You're screwed. You're a goner. Bible and work... Two thieves on me. - Just live and be well. Some friend you are! What are you looking at? What do you want? I'll give you twenty every time we do it. Well, what do you say? Take it. You are a very bad man, Mr. Salah. -Bullshit! God will punish you. What do you say... Things here aren't like in your village stories. Here, we prey on each other. Pessach is a "frayer". He deserves it! What's this word "frayer", Mr. Salah? A "frayer" is someone who lets you get the better of him. It's someone who doesn't grab what's right under his nose. You, don't be a "frayer"! You know, Mr. Salah, our good Lord said: "Whoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, "turn to him the other also." And how did he wind up? A "frayer"! A "frayer"! And who benefits? The Pope, in Rome. But why are you yelling at me? Here comes a perfect example of a "frayer". Why yell at me? Didn't I say I'm bringing someone? Why yell? He's been his wife's "frayer" for 15 years now. Dad, I asked you not to talk to me like that in front of the workers, it creates problems... And what's this fence? So everyone will know that this is Salah's land! Right Dad. Let's not talk about that now, OK? Come on, James, I have an urgent job for you. Dad, I'm... - Don't move! He's not going anywhere. We still have lots of work. The fence needs to be finished and I have some dumb friend coming over soon. -Come. But Dad, listen, this is urgent! I don't get it. Before, I had to beg you to let someone clean up this sty. Now you call me every other day, asking for this guy. Why don't you keep him just for me? He's special, this blackie. Dad, have you lost your mind? What has he got do here all day? Do you know how much it costs me to keep him? What is your old man asking for? A little help! If you and your wife intend to make millions off my back and dump me, at least give me a blackie to take care of me, to help me. Is that so much to ask? OK, Dad. I really have to take him now, but starting tomorrow I'll bring him here every day. - Well done! But you have to do me a favor, too. What's mine is yours. Promise that you'll stop with this fence nonsense, and think seriously about the property offer. Without our land, they can't build a thing, but we have to move now, Dad. Fast! Understand? It's a one-shot opportunity. What do you want? For me to spend my whole life hustling in foreign workers, Dad? OK. Reverend, go. Go with him. Great, Dad, I'll take care of everything. Yes, yes. Call the guy quickly. - See you tomorrow, Reverend! You're a good guy, James, no doubt about that. I see also you do his garden, eh? Yes. - Good. But don't put too much effort into it, maybe he'll be going to an old age home soon. What's this "old home", Mr. Shimi? You don't have them in Africa. It's a place that... he will live there, yes? With old people like him. And he won't be alone, never. Mr. Shimi. - What? -I want to know... When do I finish paying my debts to you? Your debt? Why? You want to go to Jerusalem? - Yes. OK, James. You have Saturday free. And take Sunday off as well. On me. But don't forget. If you play games with Shimi, you'll regret it. You'll go to Jerusalem and come right back. Right? OK. As long as dad is happy. James, Let's go! My wife will kill me! Hi James, we're back. Nice work. Ms. Racheli, there's Mr. Salah. What? And what is the "Mr." doing? Playing backgammon? I can't wait to wake up one morning and see something else instead of this slum. I know what you mean. Mrs. Racheli, Don't you like Mr. Salah? Me? It's him who hates me! And Why? You know, it's not a good thing to move an old man out of his house. What did you say? Isn't it better to leave Mr. Salah in his own home than to put him in this place where you put your old people? Come here, James. - What Mrs.? Come here. Who told you that? Him? Look James, it's not "mishtalem". Not for him and not for us. What is this house? A dump. And "Mr." Salah, has no pension, he has nothing. He depends on us and spits on us. What's this word "mishtalem", Mrs.? "Mishtalem" means... It's like... profit. Profit as in salary? - Yes. Exactly! - Sweetheart. OK, I have to go wake up Shimi. James, don't forget the corners please. OK, Mrs. James, come here. Come here, sit down. Come on. Perhaps you can work at my house on Saturday? You have a day off on Saturday, right? What do you say? Don't you need more money? Of course I do, Mrs. I want to buy a television for our apartment. But not as big as this one. A small one for 200 dollars. So why don't you... - I'll talk to Mr. Shimi. No, don't tell him. Like on the black market. Black! No, not black. "Under the table". On the side. Understand? All the money goes straight into your pocket. 6 hours, 150 shekels. What do you say? I... Mrs., I really have to continue with my work. What's the problem? Shimi? How much do you get from Shimi? 500 dollars a month, Mrs. He makes 4 times that off your work and you care about him? Why should I pay him 200 shekels When it doesn't go to you? Don't be a "frayer". Move up in life. OK, I understand Mrs. I'm no "frayer". I'll work for you, but not this Saturday. This Saturday I'm going to Jerusalem, for my village. Then go next week. Jerusalem isn't going anywhere, it's been there for 3,000 years. I'm paying you. Here. An advance. Take it. Jerusalem, Jerusalem. Jerusalem - you are our destiny. James, James... Come here. What do you want, Mrs. Look what I found. Well, what do you say? It's nice Mrs. Really nice. Do you want it? - Yes. We'll see about that later. Now go back to work. -OK, Mrs. What do you say? Did you see how he liked it? Maybe I'll give it to him, and take 25 Shekels off his pay... He does a great job. Racheli found him for you? With her husbands' prices? What am I, their "frayer"? I got him for half price. I come from the above, I come from the other side. I come from the above, I come from the other side. Hurry up! Hurry... OK. Bring that one. - Which one? - That one. Hurry up before somebody comes. Mr. Salah. - Hurry up! Mr. Salah, I have a favor to ask. What's mine is yours. Speak up. Tomorrow I want to work very quickly and leave early. Why? I have to. - Have to what? Are you working "halturot" (moonlighting)? What's this word "halturot", Mr. Salah? Just you wait. Reverend! I think we can make some "kombina" (shady deal). Come, I'll tell you. Get moving. Don't look like somebody died. You go work for that woman tomorrow. OK. But when my friends come, don't give me problems like you did that other time. You throw your dice like a champ! What's the problem? Your God interfering again? No, Mr. Salah, that's not it. But you know, I'm no "frayer". I'll go to one "haltura", I throw one game. Only one. Another haltura, another game. What do you say? So you learned something after all, you bastard. Four bombs went off last night and this morning in Jerusalem. The biggest bomb was planted in a car that was parked outside... Soon, James and I will be going to Jerusalem. When? Maybe I'll come too. Maybe in a month or so... I have a lot of pressure at work right now. Jerusalem isn't going anywhere. It's been there for 3,000 years. It's a really nice TV. But I didn't hear about changing the rules. Who wants watch TV in my house, will pay 5 shekels. And you, black peoples, will pay 10. It's OK? Who's pay? Look Feda, we will not be your "frayers" anymore. This is my television. We do what we want. It's OK. It's no problem. Help me please. He threatened them, beat them up. Extorted them, ruined their property. He broke this guy's TV. In addition, I declare that the detainee is a hazard to his neighbors. True. I suspect that the detainee embezzled money he was trusted with; Extorted money from his colleagues. We all know what's going to happen to Feda tomorrow? Moldavia. With nothing. All the money I owed him is gone. Gone to charity. Give me the keys, Mr. Feda. Get up. Good luck. What? - Nothing. Let's go, Ezra. We'll breathe the sweet air which fills your streets and alleys. As righteous menwe'll reap your fields. Jerusalem... My son... - Yes, Father. Sit down. It has not gone un-noticed that for the past weeks you have not been to this house. I assume you have not been to the city of our Lord. My son... Life in this country is a continuous trial. Each one does what he can. Find the way to show the Lord your love and he will forgive you. He'll forgive you. Thank you, Father. By the way, nice clothing. Thank you, Father. - They look nice on you. Now, James, I want to ask a favor of you. You see, the girls in our choir, they need new clothing. I think you'll be the best man to donate for such a good cause. How much do you need, Father? - 600 shekels only. OK, Father. But that means I'll have to take more work and my trip will be delayed a few more weeks. Let us pray together that the Lord will accept your token and also understand your delay. You see, my son, sometimes when you think about money, you think about the Lord. Amen, Father. Amen. Bastard Blackie. Joseph, don't call him that. They understand! Your son is here. Hello! -What is she doing here? That snake! She gave the apple to my son. Hello, Dad. - Hello. -How are you? Busy. What happened to your arm? - Got banged on the fridge. Hello, Uncle Joseph. -Hello. - How are you? -Fine. Hi, James. Working hard, eh? Hi, Dad. Am I your father? - That's not nice, Dad. Tell him to cut it out... Come on, Dad, we came to talk to you. - What a nice garden. Beautiful. Did James do it? Well done. Nice clothes, Jamesie. You should learn from him. James, why don't you get us a few chairs? James! Don't move! We don't need chairs. But Mr. Salah, it's hot. They have to rest. They can rest at their house. Forget the chairs. Dad, we got the contract for your land. I want you to see it. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity. Whose lifetime? Mine or hers? All of our lives, Dad. "Grab what's under your nose, and don't be a 'frayer"". Who always told me that? - I don't know. Let me be. I just want you to see how much it says: One million dollars for the land. One million dollars! You'll get a new apartment here, on any floor you want. No old age home, no nothing. You'll stay here in the neighborhood. And we'll give you James, he'll always be with you. He'll live with you and take care of you. Goodbye, Mr. Salah. - Joseph, you're leaving? -Yes. Give me that money, you swindler! What's wrong, Dad? - What's wrong? My income just left, - What? Sit down. Sit down and play. What? -If you win you can take it, sell it, do whatever you want. The blackie will throw for me. My arm hurts. You want to play backgammon with me for the house, Dad? What's wrong with you? - Mr. Salah, we can't do this. This is very important, not 100 shekels. Be quiet and play, Reverend. Or else I'll tell it all... And don't let her stand, get her a chair. It's hot! OK, Mr. Salah. OK. OK, Dad. If that's what you want, that's what you'll get. You want to play with me for the house? Fine. So that's what we'll do! Wait! You stand here. Here. No, no, you start. You do the honors. I want you to. Go on, throw. - OK! -Don't yell at me. Stop it. Shit... - Tough Luck. Come on, take it! What's the matter? Throw! - Well? Throw! Mr. Salah, I can't... Give me a pen. A pen! Do you have a pen? Here, Dad. Not in this life?! What did he write? "Not in this life!" that's what he wrote. Dad, do you remember what you said when I brought you James? You said you'd think about it. I did, and I realized that it wouldn't work. Your mother wouldn't want it. Then what would she want? For you to rot here alone in this dump? What if you fall? Who's going to help you? Dad, you can't live here alone! I have my James. He'll help me! No, Dad. James isn't here to play backgammon. We need him to work. If you can't help us then let him work like the others. She's right, Dad. I told you, he costs us a fortune. The visit is over! - Why? What's wrong? We'll talk some other day. But I want to tell you something. If you take him away, I'll give this house to charity. Thieves. Bye, Mr. Shimi. Bye, Mrs. Racheli. Thank you. It's almost as good as Miriam's. Mr. Salah... Maybe Mrs. Racheli and Mr. Shimi are right. Your house is nice, but a million dollars is a lot of money. If you don't take it, you are a "frayer". On the contrary, Reverend. If I take it, I'm a "frayer". What would someone like me do with a million dollars? If I sign... I'll never see my son again. I work and work and work, but I can never have a million dollars. That's the way it is for everyone. You don't make money by working. You have to think, not work. You should make the money, and other people should do the work. But Mr. Shimi wouldn't like it if I do this. Cover me. Listen, I have a "kombina" to offer you. What kind of "kombina"? There's a woman who needs a cleaner in the evening. Real easy work. Three hours, and you get 100 shekels. Three hours, 100 shekels? My children, let us thank brother James. It is through his kindness that this month's rent has been paid. And I believe that the good Lord will accept such an offering and grant him prosperity in all his business. And you too, bothers and sisters, as you come to me with your spiritual or religious problems, don't hesitate to go to James with your material problems. If any one of you wants a job for himself, James is the man. James is capable. James can help you. You have 5 new messages. Hi Jamesie, I hope it's the right number... Call me back it's urgent... James hi, it's Sara. Send me one on Tuesday, and one on Thursday. Hello Mr. I'm looking for a job. I got your number from the pastor. Very nice Israel? The best. Hi James, last week was fine, please send him again next week. Yes, ma'am. Why aren't you satisfied? Wait, wait, Mrs. Wait, Mrs... Reverend! - Oh, I see, corners. Reverend! Wait, I'll talk to him, I'll come there in about half an hour. Don't worry, we do a good job. There's no "hafif" with us. OK. Bye bye. You're watering too much, you'll kill them. Move on. Stop that! You're making me dizzy. Why did you bring me that drunkard? What can I do, Mr. Salah? I cannot be with you all day. I'm busy. Busy my ass! Hello. Yes. Mrs. Reuma, she told you about me? 120? She said 120? No, it cannot be, no, no. 160. Yes. I'll talk to my boy. We'll come there tomorrow. First time free. OK. Bye bye. What's wrong? Never seen someone talk on the phone? Get back to work! - Excuse me boss. I should really ask my son what he thinks about your "kombina". Mr. Salah, please don't tell him, he doesn't know. You told me to do this. Don't be a "frayer"! Remember? "Other people do the work and you make the money." Who told me that? I'll kill him! I'll kill him! That is Miriam's mint pot! Now you're going to do your work. No, Mr. Salah! - Go! I cannot work, Mr. Salah, I explained this to you already. But you, no. Mint, mint, mint, mint. Here, take for your mint pot, Take for your stupid mint. Your son was right. Why do you make a big deal out of this garden? Wasting all of our time and money. Mr. Salah always knows everything. Always telling us do this, do that, and then saying the opposite. You never think about what we want. Only Miriam and Mint Mint and Miriam! Blackie! Take your drunkard friend and get out of here. No work for you. No work in the garden, no garden, nothing. Go to my son and tell him that I don't have work for you. Let him find you another job. Go away! Go! You too! I don't want to see you! Brother! We've been waiting for our money since 8 o'clock. Skomboze, leave it, it's for my trip. Wouldn't it be better if you took me to "work" with you, to make phone calls, count money... Are you a fool? Or are you crazy? I get you good work so that you can make a good living. And what do you do? You wreck and break and drink... You're right, I am a fool. - A fool must pay. Now go get the others. Job. Five times? - Yes. Thanks. - Skomboze. Sign here please. - Thanks, boss. Thanks boss. Abraham. Three times. - Thank you. Saïd. -Excuse me, boss. This is 300 shekels short. Two times, right? Skomboze may be a fool, but knows how to count. "Break it, and you'll pay for it." Maybe that way you'll learn. My people, what do I ask? Don't do "hafif"! And you! You have nothing to learn from him. Got it? What's going on, James? - What is this? Out! Get out! Out! In your nice book, it says not to steal, doesn't it? Get off my bed. Get off my bed! You're talking to me about that book? What do you do all day? Look at yourself. I can't stand you anymore. I've had it with you! James! Hide it. Hide the money. James! Job, hide there! James! Why is it locked? What is this? A tribal gathering? Hello, Mr. Shimi. Hello, Mr. Ezra. Who's this? Who? - Him! I don't know the guy! Oh... him. He's our friend Mr. Shimi. He's sleeping here for tonight. I thought it was OK. I thought maybe you could give him a job. Come, you're coming with us. Let's go, Ezra. Get a move on! Go on James, choose for me. What? -What What? What's with you today? I need three new workers. Pick the best ones for me. Go on. - Get up, get up. And don't get me any Skombozes, eh, James? I only want guys like you. Go on. James, what's with you? You, you... and you. Hi, Racheli. Hi. Are you coming home? - Is there anything to eat? No, there's nothing... Are you alone? - No, James is with me. Jamesie. How are you? Fine, ma'am. How are you? Shimi, invite him to the party. He can keep Dad company. That's one good idea. Listen, Jamesie, we're having a little family party the day after tomorrow. We're celebrating something. - You want me to work? No, I don't want you to work, James. You're part of the family, you're invited. Bring someone else to work. The guy you showed me before. We'll see how he is, eh? What do you say? OK, Mr. Shimi. Thank you. - Shimi I have another call, bye. James, give them the details. Salary and all... OK? Hello, Ms. Re'uma. - Oh, hi James. How are you, Mr. Shimi? Oh, James! Where have you been? Here sweetie, have something to eat. Come here. Who was asking me about the blackies? Come here, James. Come. This is James, my best worker. I can trust this guy with my eyes closed. He's just like part of our family. He gave me a hard time at first. Remember, Ezra? Re'uma, Re'uma, See how he's dressed? "Mr. Shimi, I don't want to work, I want to go to Jerusalem" By the way, my dad is crazy about him. Where is Dad, anyway? There he is, Mr. Shimi. Keep an eye on him, OK? Tell your guy to give him some shade, it's hot, hot. People, what's wrong with you? We said "cheers" but didn't drink. Cheers! - Cheers! Cheers, James. To the money that's on its way! Coffee, coffee. Coffee, coffee. Hey there! Thank you. Job! Yes, boss. 5 and 4. 5 and 6. Here he is, the big boss. Where's your phone? Mr. Salah, I just want to say I'm sorry. Forget it, as long as you're all satisfied. Satisfied, Mr. Salah? Didn't they tell you what this party's for? No. They just said that the family is celebrating something. Celebrating that I no longer have a home. Why are you looking at me like that? You're the one who told me: "You never think what we want. Only Miriam and Miriam"... What did you say? I just thought, I really have to continue my journey to Jerusalem. You'll never go to Jerusalem, my son. Never! 1 and 2. Here, throw the dice for me so that I can beat myself. James! Jamesie! - What does she want? James, sweetie, I ran out of cigarettes, but I have to stay here with the guests. Could you get me some? And a lighter. And get yourself something too. Don't move, Reverend. Dad, behave. We're not at home. You got what you wanted. Don't call me Dad! Go eat some steak. And you, don't move. It's OK, Mr. Salah. I'll be right back. Hello! What's that? Skomboze... Skomboze what are you doing here? Are you trying to ruin me? What are you doing? You're ruining my cake. What are you doing? - You! get back to work now! Why did you come here? Skomboze! What are you doing here? -I'm helping out. What's wrong with them, James? Why don't you cut it yourself. Quiet! You shouldn't be here. Go home. Where's your new camera? Want a picture with your new friends? Be quiet. Did you forget who pays you? James! Come here! James! Drag your ass over here. I'm talking to you, get moving! Your friend is calling you. Come over here now! What do you want, Mr. Shimi? - "What do you want, Mr. Shimi?" What's that Skomboze doing there? I don't like him, you know that. Take him to pack his things, he's going back to Africa. Did you hear what I said? Did you forget who pays you? Go on! Ezra will take you. Ezra... - No, Mr. Shimi! What? What? James, what's wrong with you? Are you going mad or what? Are you here to celebrate with us, or to make problems? You have two choices: Either you do what I tell you or you go with him! What's your decision? -Shimi... Shimi, what's going on here? Is this our party, or your workers' party? I don't know what's up with him. What's this racket, James? Tell them we're not in the Jungle! And where are my cigarettes? Look at that... He took 50 Shekels from me. What are you doing? What are you doing? - What's this money? James! What's wrong? Your million is not enough for you? You want more? James, how dare you talk to me this way in front of people? After all we've done for you? Where did you get that money! What did you do? Go ask your friend Re'uma. - What did he say? What? - What did you say to her? Re'uma... come over here. - What about Re'uma? Reverend, Shimon, don't fight. Dad, stay out of this. It's between us. What are you babbling about? I don't even know you. Who are you going to believe? Me or this blackie? Reverend, what's going on there? - Ezra! Get handcuffs from the car. I have to go now. I want to say goodbye. Why? why? How could you do this to us? I have to go now. Go. Goodbye. You know Mr. Salah. When I tell the people in my village about this place. They won't believe me. They'll be angry with me. Come on. Let's sing of that tale that begins in a faraway village, The best young man was sent on a pilgrimage. A long journey to Zion, where the heart of the world is. To the Promised Land, beyond the seas. Zion's light in his heart to guide his way, It will keep him safe, and won't lead him astray. Officer! Officer! Where are we going? What do you want? - Are we not going to the prison? That prison is full with you guys. We're going to another one, in Jerusalem. Soon he will see that holy city, see it with his own eyes. He'll come back and tell us about the place where our dream lies... Officer! Officer! What? - Is this Jerusalem? Jerusalem, yes. Please stop. Please stop, I want to take a picture to show at home. In the village. Please sir, I beg you! Please... Please stop. Come out. Come. Quickly. Over there. With the view. Go left a little bit. Jerusalem oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you are our destiny You are our destiny. Subtitles: Cinematyp Ltd.
