BLACKIE THE PIRATE 10 pm! It's time to collect for all people Whyerkey. Are orders of the new viceroy. The new viceroy not play. You have no appetite, Pedro? We have a tasty grilled steak. I'm sure you do, but I can not afford that. The state tax collectors, dispense it. I wanted, but I need them to prove my innocence. - This does not have a penny in his pockets. - Offers you a beer. I bring you the food and pay when you can, okay? No, Manuela. A gentleman can not be indebted to a lady. So join us, if not ofenderes you... A gentleman is honored to be indebted to another gentleman... Thank you, my friend. - Fills. - Your. To his. Is in debt to the tax collectors? - Should cut their throats? - And why not? And join the Navy. The problem is that I have a good heart. Pass me the jug of wine. I said, Give me the jug of wine! You are deaf or what? No rales you poor man. My father can not use your language. Let's pilgrimage to the holy Firmino looking for answers. It's good friend. Holy Firmino will respond. He is a great saint. Who will pray to St. Firmin. This will not call you no. St. James of Compostela. There is a beautiful saint. Take your father to him to view a miracle. Thanks, but Compostela is not in America. It is in Spain. We do not have the money for passage. Let me handle it. Luckily we are short of manpower on the ship. - We can enlist you in a minute. - I said no! And they pay well too. Ortiz! In this stack is someone I know? Guess. It's Stella. No... no... I was just kidding... In p, ragamuffin. I'll teach you not to perturbares a woman protected by the Duke of Samoa. I see you have never seen any... Not Stella. Calm, my lord Duke. Target is in your business, sir. It already troubled enough. I intend to punish these gentlemen. It has nothing to do with it. For your own protection... Rid of this skewer for grilling. Who are you to compare this beauty to a skewer for grilling? This blade was tempered in the waters of Guadalupe Quibir... And you will see that... This is the best new world of sword. On guard! For a clown, you're pretty fast... This is still nothing. Apparently you are not Spanish. I'm beginning to doubt that thou art. I'm not surprised, sir. My mother is the Grand Duchess of Tuscany... Part of my childhood went to Italy to learn Spanish. - And the Duke of Zamosa? - Who is he? - Your other parent... - You're saying... You may have heard of lunge practisse? What has? It is a secret of swordsmen, when cornered give the final blow. There is no escape. - I think I know... - I can show? Please. What is going on here? Do not know what is past curfew? They are trapped! How dare you? It is an insult! I want to have fun with a friend, you should have told your guard? - Who are you to me contestares? - You do not know? Pedro de Mendoza. Heir to the duchy of Mendoza... Earl of Pompl... Pamplam Marquis... Lord Guadaluz and Grandiz in Spain! Sorry, excellence but could not guess... And forbid now of the divulgares. I'm incognito, you know... - And those there? - These... are all my friends. - And this destruction? - Destruction? But this is normal when friends have fun. So it's better to call it when I need wood for the fireplace. Let's go back to patrol. We are losing time. Forgotten Great Tuscan Duchess of friend... During our struggle, she was his mother... To pay for the damage. Mr Mrs. But this can pay the entire inn... We would be better at the inn, Captain. All troops go here. We have to get out of here. They triple the patrols when chasing that stupid. He is watching everything. - There must be some point unguarded... - Let the sea... The port is also barricaded. Calm... My God, that nervous man. I can even think they are criminals... That's why you went after me? One of his men told me about a trip and I became interested in the subject. It must have been this that spoke... The Esquimo! Astonishing. And what brought you to the Caribbean? I wanted to cure a cold. What do you want? This air is bad... and I need to breathe good air... Ah... the gates are guarded... But no guard can stop the Duke of Zamosa or to your friends, if your pocket... - Who goes there? - Good evening, gentlemen. Can we trust him? Let's go. Good night. I hope to see it more often with these pieces, my Duke. No, I do not agree with you. These ridiculous views are useless... And even at my door. The executions should be made in the mines, not here. Even if it is to be an example to the natives. In any case, I doubt this to teach them something. The whip is more efficient... And have the advantage that they can then go back to work. We always have to think of the King's interests. I have an example. The shipment of gold this year was double that of last year. And better than any other you have sent. That's why he sent me here. The war in Europe has lasted too and is getting very expensive. That's why I will spare no effort... To ensure that the gold reaches Spain. Your ship? It is very small. Well, come or not? Wait. I will also. Salta! A ship! A ship! My caravel, the "Fury"... You are the buccaneer Captain Blackie... So still think my small boat, huh? Move those arms, guys. At dawn I want to be in Tortuga. Good night, Skull... - Lusac. - Welcome. - Longbart... - Good night. - Can I? - Sit down. - Who is this? - An informer. - Bring good news? - Not Miserable.. The son of Mary is the ship "Guayaqui". - It has double bridge and 48 guns. - Hmmm... That's not all. - There is also frigatas to escort him. - How many? Three. Each with 36 guns. Your health. What's the occasion? Here the captain Blackbart act with great caution. I got a schooner and would take care of "Guayaqui". But believe on his way met a galleon... And left her masts, sinking it near the Yucatan. That's all a lie, your mouse. Your boat might never have caught that Galleon. The more the ship "old" that there... Caution, your bum! My ship is the best of the Caribbean. Your ship? Maybe if esticasses some sheets towards the wind he could move. But my "Devon" could pursue them even without wind... Because I would have attacked it from the golf Santa Monica and the reefs of Cap Teryend. I would have grabbed one galleon. None of your tubs could have done it. I made him a sporting pursuit. But he also practiced sport... To sink the navy boat by not having found no cargo on board. They are jealous because I managed to grab a valiossisima gem... But you do not even know who she is. It does not matter to me at all. Nothing? And who is going to pay the ransom? This is a small detail, is not it? It's nothing. If you know the show... Shalt thou likely to pay me your weight in gold. I know you too well. - Even you know? - Of course yes. I'll get it. Why are you causing now, when we should all be friends for now. - Why does it have to be? - It better be. If you want to attack this train. The four are necessary for us to do. Are you crazy. And the train is too strong. E goes against our motto of pirates: "Every man for himself and the others go to the devil." Para back. Make way. Get your hands off me! If you want the goat, will have to buy. But before the auction, according to the laws of the brotherhood of pirates... You can see the goods, but not touch. Come on, lady, come show up. Move it. If the purchase can make you whatever you want... But attention... first pay in doubloons diamonds. Understood? Say there... Open your eyes, your rats... Open your eyes and pull of your gold. By the ancient laws of the buccaneers... My treasure is now on auction. I see you are not blind to this opportunity. It is you who decide whether they want your ransom in gold... Or invest the gold in more personalized favors. Isabella... Adorable, beautiful, it looks like a doll... A decent toy for a king... Carmen... Working, practical, healthy... there will be no better companion on this island for a buccaneer. It is the best companion I saw here Acapulco... Let's start the auction! Quick. 100 doubloons... 120... 200... - 250. - 300 Climb over 100 doubloons! - 500 doubloons! - Good, Mico. Good 3000. Since when is that a woman is as good? 4000. - Climb over 1000. - I the same. So I climb over 1000. 8000. 9000. Ten thousand. They are worth more. 11000 12,000! It is much better... But I offer 13000. 13500. You came to your limit? 15000. We will escort them. Welcome aboard. That's the door of his cabin. Feel free. You are talking to a lady of Castile, sr. Buccaneer. I... Continue... I prefer a bullet to dishonor... I have 15,000 reasons to preserve it as it is. You're just a business. If you think I'm going to reveal to you my... I know your name... I know your name. Isabella Mendoza y Lacuna... Your husband is the Viceroy. I should have guessed what was behind... Of prevent the two in magoassemos. Do not worry, Miss. We are pirates respectful. The captain said the passengers are welcome. I'm sure our crew is not as bloody as it... Just cut their heads as if they were chickens. - You're afraid, right? - Yes. - Do not believe me? - No. Are you afraid of me? No... Do you want me to keep you company? Our "property" will be worth a lot of money, huh? The "our" property? We are not partners? We have an agreement. You enter the money, me with ideas. Remem! Remem! Opposite. Raise the blades. You too. All together, idiots. Raise the blades. Hold the ladder. Zoom boat. We came back in two hours to come get. It is a deserter from the British navy, but my best vice commander, I can not lose. It's an hour unusual visits. What do I owe the pleasure? I've been in business. I have to talk to you... in private. Start talking. - I brought you this. - It is what it is? Half the money you just pay for the girl... So that I can be your partner in business. What you propose? Half of your interest. To save you that expense, divided half of the total profit? And join all our information? Such as? For example, knowing who is that lady? You came late... I already know that. It is the Dona Isabella Mendoza. Your husband is the Viceroy. Have you heard it by your informant, right? But that's not what matters. Have you wondered why she was traveling as a normal passing an unarmed galleon? - Maybe... - and guessed? No. You okay? I do not. But thou canst solve this mystery faster than me. How? You can do it fascinate a woman, Blackie... But I do not. Get out of this ship, Skull. Why do that, Blackie? You have brains and me too. We have the most to gain if we join them. I'm better off alone. You'll regret it it, Blackie. For the gold investiste... If I can suggest... Business... business... always business. What's the rush? I have a lot of time. Of course you want to recover what they paid for me... I can get you twice that amount in gold. Why gold? As if it mattered what her husband tripling or doubling... It does not matter to us... Prepare the cannons! Clear the deck. Rifles ready to shoot! Fighting Stance! If you like both of these bawling nonsense why deserted the English navy? Turn the cannons to starboard... Now! Cursed Skull! I'll chase you. Move it to have some action! Hey I'll tell you! I'll sink it! That damned Blackie knew who we had met and who she was... He knew for sure her value before us! Now Skull should also know. Captain Skull, Lusac is heading for the sea. Damned traitors! He handed the sure game. When am I going to be released? Do you want to leave me? I'd hate to have to leave it, but... Where to? Tell me and sail there. The "Furia" will always be at your disposal. I think it's kind and very generous... But it is very curious. I mean, women did not deserve to keep their secrets? Captain! Captain...! We're being followed by two ships! And "Eclaire" showed us the guns. See! Desfraldem the candle! Wilson, waiting my order. Shane, take the helm. Blackie! Do you hear me? The board of captains decided that the auction was conducted illegally! You have five minutes to land the woman! Well... what is your answer? They planned this together... How is the candle? Wilson, obey my order! It gives you a side shoots as they are in our reach! Preparing fuziiiiii... Explode this boat out of the water! Hurry up guys! I want to see if you are fast! Do not be looking! Shoot too! Failed all the shots! And managed to pass us! What were you thinking, you idiot? I would like to use your heads like cannonballs... And use them as food for fish, you bastards! You too! It's been the worst. We got rid of those two. Now we can go through Lusac. Prepare for pursuit! Ready to sec... Where do you come up with these orders? Behind them. And I gather that you have a plan to address them? But Lusac will already do this. Lusac? Total idiot! There is the enemy. 1000 doubloons to who take down the mast to stop that ship. With the wind against them, we have nothing to fear from them. This is no time or place to get rid of Lusac. Let's remove one of its masts. Martin explains that to Stiller. Anda. Do you see? Shoot! Fire! Stiller! Perfect! Good shot! All men in combat position! Hurry... Care, friend. Where? We give Isabella to her husband. Isabella? And your gold? Do not worry. Our investment is under control. Right to the "Baia dos Pescadores". If you wish you can count the gold to see if the sum required. - You asked for a ransom? How could you? - Just to save his honor, Isabella. - Save my honor? - Of course. What would you think her husband to surrender for nothing? And what would you think of me too? 50000. doubloons into eight parts. Asked 50,000 doubloons to my husband...? How then... "Do not you interested if he or tripling the amount doubled, huh?" Absolutely. What he paid is much better. But nothing will stop me... Until you have the pleasure to see him hanged in the largest square of Guayaqui! And when that happens... Your miserable pirate... I have put it in the living spit! To toast! Why are you crying? Speaks! Responds! Lady... I do not know. So take this! Now you have a reason to chorares. Wilson sends prepare the candles. Yes, Captain. Now let's talk business, yes? We get equal amounts? No, because we have to figure out what it cost me. It is only a mere 15000. Right. It's not? More the amount I give to my crew. How much? About twenty porcentos. And the rest in equal amounts? A moment. I think you should invest. Invests in my next business and you will get a great profit. What is it? A surprise. Shane. Let's get close to Guayaqui. So, Pedro? Yes or no? It's a good opportunity. I invest. General... Get out front. Thank God, Isabella... I confess I was very anxious... - For me or for them? - Of course you... Imagine if they found out the real reason for your "trip" things have gone wrong. - A woman knows how to be discreet. - I do not doubt said, but... The risk was in any of his sailors. "Saved" by a pirate of all his crew. So we were lucky. But my baby should still be in shock. She has entered. Next time have to be followed. I get to watch, Captain. She did not pass us by. Finally here comes the wine... It is the best... Here they are... A votre! Pedro. How are you doing? From the looks of your dinner, I see that many have charged rent. What? Was increased? No, it's not that... I seized a unique opportunity. I earn a lot of money. Soon, I'll buy all this hostel. I? I'll be your partner? You become was a lady... As fine as a silk sheet... I'm a gentleman... I'm glad, sir... Expected to return to power you... Thank You Card I see who is dealing with highly of you. Of course, we'll be rich. For... The gold was loaded. TheY will come to Port Sea is so much that it will make you drop your eyes... I hope that my part of the money is well invested. There frigates to escort them? Of course. There's two. Two. But I had said it was three. Yes, but one disappeared from sight. No one knows it. The "Victoria". You think I'm a dustbin? See, Miss... It is now in Spain... Will give a beautiful white blanket... It is very beautiful... Martin! What are you doing... - Because you risk? - I ventured, because I needed to see you again. Let's go. I could have told me and find yourself in Plaza Mayor. Why? I came to tell you that I found a way to become rich... The "we", Martin? Of course. But you have to help me. I do not know if I can. But tell me about it. But your part is easy. It is for our good. I want to take you out of here. And I want you to use gorgeous dresses for the rest of your life. E... and it's really easy? Do you trust me? Tell me then what I do. Wait a minute. I'll tell you everything. Make way. Make way to pass the Governor's properties. Clear. Clear. Make way. Beggar! I teach you the teres respect for the Duke of Zamosa! I'll cut you ears! But what have I done? Soldiers! Arrest these men! Behind them! Here! Why here! Move. There's nothing to see! I know what you stole? Sand? They are charging the "Santa Maria" with sand? But why? That means we invest our money in a sand laden ship! The load is across the board. The ship is ready to go. Oh, my dear... Your ticket home. The "Victoria" probably do not need me. On the contrary. And I decided to follow you. You'll never me. I failed you ever? Of course not, Isabela. Thou hast thought all magnificently alone here. But to me your presence in court is essential. You think you that I want to spend the remainder of my life here? It would be absurd not to make use of this huge shipment of gold. Do not you rather be vice duchess at the Royal Court? I count much with the value of this gold... But above all with your influence at court. Honey, what keeps you here, to this land of savages? Nothing. Only the displeasure of not being able to settle accounts with that pirate. So it will be the last laugh... Or maybe not. Do not worry, Alfredo. You can withdraw your investment. Supposed to accept the sand business. Gain as much as I will invest? - . Do not I get half. - 50%? - Depreciation... - Depreciation? 50%? I need time to think. Right. 50... - For left your post? - I already have inside information. No need to stand guard. And the palace is quite open. I know, before it leaves the palace. - Martin is right. - We'll see. There are many doors. I know him well. As a visitor? Yes a visitor... economic problems... I was fired from the post of... silver polisher. Silver polisher? I polish the dinner service pieces. DO NOT LAUGH, idiot. - Atraiste the attention of the guards here. - I? - Good evening, Captain. - Look who's here... The Raglan Duke... The Marquis of Sag Bridge... Almost falls in these your lies... - Did I? - Yes, but now I hold it... - Really? - Yes To you and to all others.. Be at ease. Come run this side here! - Right this way, gentlemen! - Let's go guys. Tthere! Let's go! Caution! Why here! Get in! Come on! Let's go. - Captain? - Wait. Surrender or you're a dead man! Blackie, will be fine... For now... How do we go from here? I'm not silly. Get out the door that will give the patio. Thank you, Manuela. Let's go guys. We can not waste time. You are angry. I never thought I would be so upset by 15,000 doubloons, Isabella. I mean, Donne Isabella. Ten more! Isabella, why waste time with this? Well... he may have information that may interest us. Interesting us? But what? That D. Alonso is an imbecile? The ships departed and even he knows where they are? However... If it is made difficult, there are other ways, besides the whip to make him losen his tounge. The garrote... I'm not doing difficult, excellence... Ask me what you want... I give you all the details. What could you tell me, young man? He must not know anything... What? He did not tell me where your friends are... That's why we can not waste any more time, unless... That you have other reasons to inflict pain. What reasons? It may have you treated without respect, when you were captured. No. Behaved very well. So... we hang high it and let's go! It just seems. It would be better to put it into forced labor. In mines they know how to deal with brutes. I can not contradict you, but I think hanging would be too merciful. As you wish, Isabella! But hurry up because our departure is long overdue. Hurry up, you idiots! The fire is about to go off! Almost we had to go to bed hungry! - Why dinner is late? - The fault is theirs. Blame them? Look who's here... Not escape me this time. Follow me! Let's muchachos! Right! Are you there, Blackie? - Are you there, Blackie? - On here. - Are you okay? - Watch the door. It took you a bit, Pedro. For the next I come here before you. Aperta this well. Let's go! Lie the door down! Okay... Tell them that I have... Our Lady, help us... Hail Mary, full of grace... - I am blessed you... - Already. Come on, Stiller! There they are! Let's get out of here! Let's see! - Do not behave like a pig. - Miss, I'm a gentleman! You are all gentlemen. - Again, thank you, Manuela. - You promised you would live like a lady. Forgive me, Manuela. For abandoning Guayaqui. From now on, do not let him. - But it was just a business. - What do you mean by that? Did wrong to put your faith in me... It is a pity, but now... the two are poor... Bad bet. Now Isabella took the gold and fled the ship... Never will take. At least not in this bathtub... - It was not by sea, was on the ground. - Are you sure about that? - It would take the carriage... - To where? I do not know. Martin, do not lose any wind... I want to get the "Fury" as soon as possible. Stop. Lady Isabella is tired! There in front there is a village india. We will spend the night there. Continue. Shane! They're all asleep? Do not sleep as much as you. A wise decision, Captain Blackie. I can not deny that my desire was to see you hanged. I would have killed you, if not for the charity of our dear Captain Skull. This rascal is mine. That was the agreement. They are all yours, sir. My crew? Downstairs. But do not worry about them. They will not even do anything. Let's go. Only be satisfied when cutting the throat to the rascal. Not now... But beginning to get suspicious of Skull... Let's go to our caravels. We must be prepared... E cautious... Are you satisfied? Already it would have been hanged if not for me. What is the idea? An exchange. Tell me what you found out in Guayaqui. You were there, right? Sharing gold, not counting those clowns, it's not a bad plan. Can attack the Spanish ships in ports. But they can do nothing against the strong. So they needed the "Fury". It will be the bait to attract the strong fire, as we disembarked. Maybe it's a crazy plan... But where there's fire, there's smoke... What disses? Will you share your information? What happens next? I have not always taken care of you, Blackie? You and your friends are alive. And my crew? Are aboard the "Fury"... So forget... Well, I think I know a way to make you talk. Understand? Holds others. And keep away. I want a good view of all. - Yes, sir. - Lowell... I weapons ready tonight. Tomorrow I want to start early. It's a secret! Get me the girls. They will speak more easily than Blackie, I know... Where will lead us? - Now hear - me, my dear... - Yes? You want to tell me how much you love me? Be merciful to us, God's mother... Please have mercy... Are you afraid? Of course not... I'm just worried about my beautiful clothes... those I'd buy me! So... if you do not believe me, Carmen... Of course, Martin... God Mother, give me the strength... Quick! Let's go. What is it, captain? For covered! For the cover, your moleng es! Quick before desanque everyone! Quick! Fast! Can you hear me? Move! All to the main deck! Get ready for all ataquuuuu... - The route, Captain? - Keep you by the "Fury". Hey, and his boat was captured? What's the rush? - I will follow him. - Carefully... I looked everywhere. The doubloons still must be on board the "Fury". This boat can not mine. Wait a minute... What about our money? If you want to invest, trust me, Pedro... And quadruple your money, right? How depend on your luck... Or know where Isabella hid the gold, which still has no clue... I trust you. But it has to divide its share in half, too. - Half of my? - Yes. - Information. - Because? Because I know where she hid the "Victoria". I'm amazed. As? Heard here and there. And remembering what I heard. Okay. Combined. Right. Where is the "Victoria"? Do you remember the story in the pirate bar? Do you remember where he was and the maneuvers he had to do... When chased and captured D. Isabella? In Derion reef in the Bay of San Juan. It is most likely. My respects. And if it is there, I will give you the rest of my money. A pirate ship! Carry the cannons! Load the cannons! Come away! Is the "Fury"! I want the best men in the canyons. - Where is the Skull? - Never mind the Skull. Vamos! Follow me! Fire! Fire! Let us out! Let us out! Liberate us! Pirates! The Pirates! - Shut the door! - Wait for me! It's safe! Follow me! Here down! Peter! The "Fury"! Brings us. Surrendered himself. Nor need the Skull for this. What are we waiting for? Our gold is under our feet... Do not push! - Do not push! - Behind us! Part this one! Let's go! Open! The captain found us! - Captain! - Where is my gold? Who cares about your gold? Quick, boys! The "Fury" is about to explode! Quick! Sand! It's all sand! - Scoundrel! - Scoundrel! 50,000 doubloons to fish! Yes. But not yours. Yes, it's true. Mine are on board the "Victoria" in the bay of San Juan. To north of Easton, and then keep the course. - This route does not go to San Juan. - Actually... - Go to Campetri. - Because we go to Campetri? It's supposed to go to the bay... As you wish. What if I sell you my share for a doubloon? I think fair. Can not make walking the fastest horses? We are losing a lot of time... - Martin! Faster. - Fast, Stiller. There is no wind! Olsen, watch the breeze! All candles are extended. So Blackie. We will arrived on time with this bath? I bet the "Albatross" is the best ship that ever You sailed! I was a caravel with 36 cannons, if this fool had not sacrificed "Furia" salver for this tub! - You can not compare with my... - Shut up, Skull... Or I give you to eat sharks. All we can do is achieve the "Victoria" before he leaves the sea... There not able to pursue with this bowl. It's hopeless! Para! Five us and three quarters! We never get there. - Martin! - Yes, Captain? Throw everything we need not board outside... including guns. No! We need them? Cannons sometimes are useful. With the firepower of the "Victoria" we are better without the extra weight. We're almost there. This was the last - Now we are like unarmed ducks. The captain knows what he does. I decided it is better to be dead now... Do you see the "albatross" to sacrifice for you. The candles are prepared. We can go now. Come on, honey. Or we'll lose the tide. Boat in sight! Is anchored to starboard. Follow the wind to bring them to me his. Yes, Captain. Continue to follow the route. Okay... but then what? Must be him. I do not know anyone else with such audacity. It? Who is he"? Of course. Your pirate. Two bedrooms to the left! A moment! - Why change course, admiral? - To avoid them. For your protection. Thank you for your concern, Admiral... But I have a score to settle with the pirate who dared to capture my wife. It's for her sake and mine. Let's attack! - Shane! - Yes, Captain? It was his fault that the "Fury" was captured and destroyed. - You'll be at the helm. - Yes, Captain! I know I must. The devil is that you stay! I am at the helm of the "Albatross"... It will be the last time you come into action... It is yours. It seems they want to set off the caravel to bits. Fire! Fire! Fire! Reached them end to end. No one could have survived that. So we'll have to hang only the remains of our pirate. If you promise something to a lady, we must to do as it should be. As you wish, excellence. We will approach the boat. Prepare the hooks. Now! It's a trap! Take cover! Take her down! Been there? I pulley dishes... Not bad for a "polisher", huh? Ordered me to take her to the quarters of Captain... But do not worry, it's a respectable pirate... What happened between my wife and you? You and Isabella...? Assure you practically nothing. "Practically"? Three times twelve are thirty-six... times two gives seventy-two... I'm counting the barrels... finally we are rich, Blackie! - Where is Isabella? - Inside there. But first, can you tell me how you knew the exact location of the "Victoria"? It's simple. The Gulf of Campetri is the only one with access to the mines, as well as being a good hiding. I never thought of that... But what matters is that I know my part is great... How much track me? - You want your party now? - You can do it? Toma. A doubloon? You mentioned that amount in our last agreement... Sold me your part by this value. Best impossible. Captain... Seems that underestimated... There was a time when chamavas me Blackie... It's true. But it was his prisoner. Much has changed since then. - The shipment of gold... - I hope it's a lot. This ship has real on board 30,000, maybe more. What a surprise. Who would say? This amount spent in a war, could decide who wins and who loses... But for one person, it's too much money... - I have to pay a crew. - A pirate crew! A criminal who appear in Spain with this amount, it would only be entitled to amnesty... But also other unimaginable things. For example? A duchy... Being General of the whole Spanish navy... And if you like... If you like? If you like me... Just think, Blackie, how much we can be happy together... Nothing... You know Isabella... Both want the gold and none want to divide it. - I do not want gold. - I know. Your poor King is you need. But no more than my king. It is the King of England. It depends on independent persons. That's why I became a privateer. We have to feed our nobles and their real families. Silence! Do not cry... There's more than gold. We can always open a new hostel. It's true. Who wants gold? Especially this. You still afraid to invest? Your doubloon may represent something in my next plan. I do it. But beware. You're not smarter than me. I have no doubt that, Manuela. What did you mean by that? What this house who does the math me. Set sail! Prepare the candles! - Go to England! - Yes, Captain. For North and nortdeste, then straight through the next 3000 miles!
