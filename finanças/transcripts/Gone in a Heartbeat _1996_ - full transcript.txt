(Multicom Jingle) (soft music) (dog barking) (soft music) - Hey, Dad. - Oh, I got it, babe. Okay, oh my God, what do you have in there? Is your mother in there? - That's my bathroom stuff. - Did you ever find your leather jacket? - Yeah, Mom, it's in there. - I got it, I got it. - Oh, do you want to carry this one too? - Five minutes of my being good, then you're on your own. - Not here for good, I don't like the sound of that. - That's what it feels like. - There's enough food in here to last the whole semester. - The way you eat, that's more than enough. I don't want them mailing you back here in an envelope. - [Daughter] Mom, don't worry, I'll eat. - I love you, sweetheart. - Love you too, Dad. - I'll miss you, Mom. - Yeah. In a month you'll be saying, Mom who? - We'll see you. - Bye. - You guys drive extra safe. - Yeah, we will. - Dad, you forgot something. - Now call us tonight, okay? - Okay. Don't forget to call, I got it. Hey, don't rent out my room. - Are you kidding? Who would sleep in that mess? (laughing) - Go easy on the ice. - Love you. (horn beeps) - Well. Thank God they're gone. (scoffs) (sighs) I'm gonna change. Help open up the restaurant. - I'll go with you. I don't want to be alone in there either. (soft music) (upbeat music) - [Server] Hi, can I help you? (people chatting) (upbeat music) - Yeah, well how many kids do you have? (people chatting) (upbeat music) - Hi. Everything okay, guys? - Yeah, yeah, everything's fine. They were my favorite CDs, man. - How do you know it was Todd who swiped them? - 'Cause he was hovering over the CD player all night. Never bring your CDs to someone else's party. I violated my own motto, damn it. - So why don't you just ask him to give them back? - I did. He says he didn't have them. He's lying but I can't prove it. He's beaten me. I can't stand it, man. - It's not over. You can still beat him. We find out if he's got the CDs. We'll search his house while everyone's out, like tonight. The whole family goes to church. What do you say? - I say that sounds like a superior idea. - [Woman] Excuse me, Michael? - Yeah. - I just printed this out and we need your okay. - [Michael] All right, that's great. - Thanks. - Perfect. Now, I need 400 of these by Monday morning, is that okay? - Oh, no problem. - Yeah? - Yeah. - All right. Looks great. - Thanks. - All right. (people chatting) (upbeat music) - Hold on, let me help you. What is it exactly we're doing? - Just moving it a little bit more this way. Okay, okay. Good. Now, people will practically have to climb over it to get out the door. - That's what we're doing? - People have been ignoring it. Now they can't. We'll shame them into contributing. - I don't want to shame people into contributing. They should give of their own free will. - They will, if they're forced to. Honey, this whole thing was our idea. We have to do what it takes. - Okay. I'm gonna run down to the bank. I'll be back in a few minutes. Can you imagine doing this in Chicago? Walking down the street with this kinda money? - That's why we moved up here, remember. - Okay, now bring it back to you. Keep the button down, let up. There, we're in the Smithsonian. All right now, do you want art, artifacts, or inventions? - You decide. - Inventions. All right, now push the button down. Bring it up to inventions and there. - Okay, let it go? - Yep. (doorbell rings) Okay. Now. - [Mother] Michael, your friends are here. - Hey man, you all set? - One second. Hey listen, I gotta run out with the guys for a little, but I'll be back, okay? - Where are you going? - You know what, play around with the computer. You need to learn how to use it anyway. I'll see you. (soft ominous music) (clanging) Damn it. Not here. Maybe he sold them. He's smart, that's what I would've done. - Hey, I've been meaning to get this one. (clanging) - You need something to play it on? - Sure. - Guys. (soft ominous music) (laughing) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - That's a superior weapon. - Look guys, I'm outta here. I don't want any part of this. I shouldn't even be here. - No, no, no, no, you are here, pal. If you want to bail, then you bail. But if you shoot your mouth off, when we go down, you're going down too. You got it? Hey, you got it? Think he'll screw us? - No. I'm not someone who gets screwed. (intense music) Let's get the hell outta here. (intense music) - You know, I've been thinking-- - Ssh, ssh, ssh, listen. - What? - Nothing. - No kids. It's weird. - You gonna be okay? - I'll be fine. - Am I gonna be enough to fill up this house for you? - Let's see. (groans) - You know, there's one really great thing about this. - We can finally make noise. (laughing) - Go on. (laughing) (horn beeping) (upbeat rhythmic music) - Anyway. He said that if you smuggle weapons in the Canyon, ones that are legal here but illegal there, you make a fortune. And he lives in Denver, he's a big gun collector. I think we might be able to do business with him. (buzzer blares) - Hey, you know what else there's a big market for? I saw it on TV. Computers, hot computers. - David. I just got a world class idea. - [Mr. Ross] That was very good work today. Read chapter six and seven. There will be a test next week. Goodbye. (people chatting) - Sorry I disagreed with your equation, sir. - No, no, you were right. But I gotta tell you, it's a little humiliating to realize that your star pupil has passed you by. - Well, you're a great teacher, Mr. Ross. - Yeah well, you'll be a great professor, if that's what you decide to do. - That's what I want. - You know, it's really reassuring to hear a bright young person dreaming about an academic career instead of fame and fortune. Most kids today are only interested in what they can get out of life, not what they can give. If there's anything I can ever do to help you, Michael, you know that you can count on me. - I know that. Thank you, Mr. Ross. - Hi, welcome. Here's the menu, I'll be right back. (people chatting) - Hey. - Hey, Tony. - I heard the restaurant's gonna donate all the food for the game. How are we gonna handle it? - Don't worry, Tony. Just because Mark and I are crazy doesn't mean we expect the rest of you to be. (laughs) You'll all be paid for the extra work. But we'd like you to do the extra work. - Sure, that's cool, I'm in. Jan? Jan, what's the matter? Jan! - Call an ambulance. Jan? - [Mark] Jan? Don't try to talk. Just breathe. - I'm getting an ambulance. - Hurry up! Okay, just try to relax. Breathe, honey. Just try to breathe. We're getting somebody, hurry up! (soft ominous music) (sirens blaring) (ominous dramatic music) - What's the bottom line? - The bottom line is that you have a seriously compromised heart, Mrs. Hale. - What do we do about that? - Well, you could have bypass surgery. But with someone your age, I'd suggest waiting. Chances are you'd just need it again when you're older. - Yeah but what do we do about it now? - Well, we'll get her stabilized. Then I'll put her on a regiment of medication and moderate exercise. Avoiding at all costs any unnecessary physical strain or emotional stress. - Avoid emotional stress. That's like saying don't let the dog know you're afraid. - You can do it. She'll do it. - Okay. I'll check back later. (machines beeping) - I'm gonna go call the kids. - No, you'll just scare them. I don't want them to know. - Their mother just had a heart attack. - And she survived. (soft music) (muffled TV commentary) - Hi, Dad. - Hi, guys. What's all that stuff? - Oh, we're just storing some equipment for a friend, that's all. - Well, careful on the stairs. (muffled TV commentary) - What if I can never be myself again? - You're always gonna be yourself. Just a slowed down version of yourself. Which could compare to most everybody else's top speed. - You're really enjoying this, aren't you? Taking care of me. - Yeah, I love it. Because I love you. And this gives me a chance to show it. - I love you too. But I don't want to spend the rest of my life as some fragile little butterfly. I don't like being helpless. - You're not gonna be helpless for long. And for now, letting me do this for you is a real gift for me. Take your pills. At least the picture's not bad. You look adorable. I don't know about me. I hate the article. - Well, it's free publicity for the games. - Yeah, it's a bit too much about how money we gave. The whole thing makes us sound like these annoying rich people on an ego trip. - You know, four people called this morning and they were all very complimentary. - Well, what are they gonna say? You guys sound like annoying rich people on an ego trip? Oh, here. "Mrs. Hale is a tireless dynamo "who won't take no for an answer." They got that part right. - Guess what? - What? - This tireless dynamo is getting a little tired. - Oh, honey. I knew it was too soon for you to come out. - It's been a week. - Come on, back to bed. - David, I've been thinking. We should pick up the guns in Denver. They'll be a lot easier to smuggle than the computers. We can fit them right in the door panels of the car, cruise right over the border. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What about the computers? - We're gonna put them back. - Put them back? - Yep. It'll be fun, man. Be screwing with everyone's head. The school, the cops. - This is so cool. All this is so cool. - Where do your parents think you are? - With you. They like it when I hang out with you. - Yeah? - They don't get it though. I mean, everyone keeps saying, why would such a brilliant, popular boy like you spend so much time with a kid like me. - What'd you say? - I don't know. I still don't know. - [Michael] Are you serious? - Yeah, dead serious. - David, the whole world expects me to be the way your parents see me. They would freak if they knew what goes on inside of me. So I give them what they want. And what they need me to be. But you like what's inside of me. With us, I can be myself. All right, let's go. (soft ominous music) - Too bad you guys don't have some real money. - What do you call that? - Wait, wait. Go on. - Just got a great lead. Contact in South America. If you had $100,000, I could turn it into a million in less than a month. - You talking about drugs? - You would just be investors. That would be your only involvement. Look, guys. I'm just doing this as a friend. - How much time would we have to raise the money? - Planning a bake sale? - How much time? - Three weeks. - See, I told you people would start to get it. - Oh, you are a pirate. (laughs) (mellow music) - Think about it, a million dollars. We could both go off to college rich. Live in high style. Never even have to work all the way through graduate school. - With a million dollars, who needs college? It's a nice fantasy. It's too bad a ticket to that fantasy costs 100,000 bucks. - We could get it. David, there are rich people in this town with money to burn. - They're just gonna hand it over to us? - They would. If it meant the safe return of a loved one who's been kidnapped. - Go on. - We wouldn't hurt anybody. Of course, we won't let them know that. We have to make sure they take us seriously. But if we plan this right, this whole thing could be over in just a few hours. - Wow. Really think there are people in this town who'd come up with 100,000 bucks in cash? - Sure, sure. - [Jan] So tell me more about this. - [Mark] Yeah, who is this guy? (laughing) - Oh, stop it. - You're my good luck. (ominous music) (phone rings) - Hello? - Hi, you doing all right? - Yeah, it just takes me so much longer to get myself together. It's driving me crazy. - Honey, give it time. - I know, I know. Just get so annoyed with myself. - Mm-hmm. - I know you keep telling me. - Thanks, thanks very much. - What? - [Mark] No, I was just talking to the customer. (doorbell rings) What were you saying? - Oh, that must be the dry cleaner's. I'll see you soon, sweetie. - All right, I'll see you soon. - [Server] Oh boy. - Is it getting cold out there? - Freezing. Radio says we could be in for some snow. - Oh, clam chowder. This is a clam chowder kind of a day. - All right. - Oh, I thought you were the dry cleaner's. (screams) Oh my God, oh my God. What's, oh, oh my God. - Is there anyone else in the house? - Yes, my husband's upstairs. He has a gun. That was smart, I almost believed you. - Who are you, what do you want? - Where are your car keys? - There, there. What are you, what are you gonna do? Where are you taking me? Where are, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. My medication, it's in my bag, for my heart. - No, you're good. - No, look in the bag. It's for my heart. (ominous music) (whimpering) No. No. No, no, no, no, no. No, where are you taking me? Where are you gonna take me? What, oh no. No, please, no. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. (whimpers) - You have to be quiet now. I'm sorry. (whimpering) Shut up! (whimpering) Be quiet. (ominous music) (phone ringing) - Damn, she must've left already. I wanted her to bring me a sweater. - Well, you can't have mine. - Aww. (ominous music) (whimpering) - Please don't do that. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What are we doing? - Change seats. - Why? Okay, okay, okay, okay. It's too tight, it's too tight. It's tight, that's tight. - This will all be over in just a few hours. You just relax and sit it out. - Relax? - Listen to me very carefully, for your own good. There are 10 of us and someone will be here at all times with an automatic rifle trained on you. So don't try anything stupid. Don't try anything, period. Got it? - Yeah, yeah, okay. (whimpering) (intense music) - Try calling her again. - No, I've been calling her. What if she had an accident? Except somebody would call us, right? Worried about her heart. Maybe she can't get to the phone. (phone ringing) I'm going home. - Joey's. One moment. Mark. (mellow music) Something about Jan. - Yeah? - We have your wife. We have 10 men and assault weapons. Go to your house and await further instruction. We will call again at two o'clock. Do not call the police. All right, end of phase one. Now we establish our first alibi. - What's wrong? - Nothing, the doctor followed up. - Thought you were going home. - Yeah, I am, I will. (ominous music) Maybe some kind of a sick joke. (phone ringing) Come on, honey, be here, come on. (phone ringing) Don't call the police, yeah right. (ominous music) - David. Gee, I'd have thought a Saturday, I'd find you out drag racing or something. - Yeah well Michael said you were gonna help him out with an experiment. Sounded cool. - You just want to be here for when the school blows up, right? - Hey, I hope you don't mind I dragged you here on a weekend. - You kidding, this is fun. Go on, grab an apron. Let's see if I know what I'm doing here. - Okay. - So. You think they'll ever catch the guys who stole the computers? - I don't know, everybody's still trying to figure out how and why they got returned. - We have to leave at 1:45. Ready, sir. - Ready, Michael, do the honors. - Okay. (horn blaring) - Can you hear me? Hey! Hey! Hey, can anybody hear me? I have to go to the bathroom! Hey! Is anybody there? (ominous music) (muffled dispatching) - Hey, hey, look. It's her wallet. The car's gone. (groaning) (soft music) - Hello? (soft music) - Going crazy, Mark. But if this is a kidnapping, I gotta call the CBI. And before I do that, I gotta know it's real. - Ben, I didn't make up the phone call. - I know that but it could've been a hoax. - Hoax? Then where's Jan? - What's this? - That's hers. That's her day planner. - Don't touch it. I think it's time to stop touching things. - Look. There was somebody at the door when I was talking to her from the restaurant. The dry cleaner, I think. Maybe saw something, we should call them. (phone ringing) - Hollander Cleaning. - Yeah, this is Mark Hale. You were at my house earlier today to drop off-- - Oh we haven't been out yet, Mr. Hale, I'm sorry. We had a power outage, we're way behind. - You're sure you weren't there at all? - [Dry Cleaner] I'm really sorry. I hope we're not sitting on something you desperately needed. - No, it's okay. Thanks, thanks. - Get the squad cars outta sight. Let's hope they haven't been watching the house. (phone beeping) - [Alice] Rock Point Police. - Alice, it's Ben. I need you to patch me through to CBI in Denver. - [Alice] Right away. (ominous music) - Okay. An inch at a time. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. I think we might've missed a step. You know, just to be safe, we better start over. - So we just do nothing until they get here? It's a good two hours from now. - They want to call the shots. Guess they must think we're a bunch of keystone cops up here. - Mr. Hale, is there any reason the bedding would be gone from your bed? - One of the neighbors saw a man driving away in Mrs. Hale's car. He couldn't tell if Mrs. Hale was inside. - So two hours, huh? We're gonna wait two hours? - No, damn it, I'm not. I'm gonna get a plan up to search for Jan's car. I'm gonna call Judge Row, get a tap on this phone. If the kidnappers do call back at two o'clock, we'll be ready for them. (phone ringing) (soft music) (groaning) (soft music) - Mark. Mark? Mark! Mark. (soft music) (glass shattering) - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - You're really having problems today, Michael. This isn't like you. - Yeah, I know, I know. I'm feeling a little dizzy and it's maybe from the chemicals. - You better be careful about that. Here, sit down. - Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm okay. - Well, I think we should stop. - Oh. All right. - I'll take him home. - I should go with you. - No, no, no, I'll be fine. - I got him. - Yeah, you sure? - Yeah, thanks Mr. Ross, really. - [Mr. Ross] Well, if you have any trouble, you call me, all right? - Thank you. - That's very kind. - Take it easy. - Okay. - Damn. I still can't find Judge Row. He's hunting. - So that's it, no wire tap. - Not without a court order. - For God's sake, Ben. You're gonna blow your one chance at getting these guys over a formality? - I can't break the law, Mark. - Tell that to Jan. If she's still alive. - That's not fair. (phone ringing) Answer it. (phone ringing) - Yeah, hello. - Hi Mark, this is Tony. We just got a meat delivery but everything was wrong. We got ground instead of chuck and not a sausage in sight. - Yeah look, Tony. You call them, you tell them you're talking for me. And you tell them to correct that order today. Not tomorrow, not the next day, but today. Or else we'll get ourselves a new supplier, you understand? - You got it. (phone ringing) - Hello. - We want $100,000 in $20 bills by four o'clock today. Or $200,000 tomorrow. The price goes up every day. And put the money in a suitcase and drive to the Old Post Road, heading one mile east. There'll be a piece of plywood on the shoulder. Leave the bag there. - Look, I need to know that my wife is okay. Can I just-- - After we get the money. - Was it the same person, the same voice? - I don't... No. Definitely not the same. - Then we have to assume there's a number of them and that they're heavily armed. - Bastards. Why Jan? Why do this to Jan? - Mark, you have access to the kind of money they're demanding. - Yeah. - And that's why. - All right. You go hang out with your folks for awhile. I'm gonna watch the First National Bank to see if he goes to get the money. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. You sure that's the right bank? - Yep, I followed him there twice. He was carrying those zippered money bags from the diner. Now look, we've only given him two hours to make the drop, so he's gotta get the cash soon. If he does, if he does, I'll call you, you go to the drop site and wait. When you get the money, meet me back at Martine's house. - Are you sure he's gonna do this? - Of course he will. What choice does he have? - I want to pay it. I want to pay the damn ransom and get her back. - I don't know if that's the way to get her back, Mark. This town has never had a kidnapping before. I don't know. But everything I've read and everything I've heard suggest that paying the ransom is the very, very last resort. - But what if we get to the last resort and I don't have the money? - Who do you deal with at the bank? (soft music) (groans) - Okay. (soft music) Okay, okay. Stay calm. (soft music) Just you and me, guys. (soft music) (engine roaring) Hello? Hello! Hello! Hello! I'm here! Hello! Here. Here. I'm here, I'm down here! Hello! Hello! - [Pilot] See anything? - [Officer] Uh-uh, I think we're wasting our time. - [Pilot] Okay, then let's head back. - I'm here. They're searching. They'll be back. (soft music) - [Ben] Mark, I'd like you to meet Special Agent Gray from the Colorado Bureau Investigation. - Mr. Hale, I want you to know that we're gonna be doing everything possible to capture your wife's abductors. - I want you to do everything possible to find my wife. - That's how we'll find her. You see normally, we'd be doing both at the same time. Searching for your wife and laying a trap for the kidnappers. But they're predicting a blizzard. - We may have to call off the aerial search. - But we've got no time here. My wife has a heart condition. There may be a blizzard. They may be keeping her outside. I just want to pay the money. - Sir, I want you to get this into your head. The ransom money is our only connection with your wife. You give it up, we give her up. - Mark. You're just gonna have to trust that we're doing what's best for Jan. - I'll be working very closely with Chief Alpert here. My men with his men. You're in good hands, Mr. Hale. - All right, what's next? - Well, we'll go back to the house and wait for the next phone call. - How do we know there's gonna be another phone call? - Because we didn't leave the money. (ominous music) - [Actor] Hey, everybody shut up. Who is this guy? (laughing) Joe, who's Joe? - [Actor] Here, I'm sorry, maybe I should've-- - [Actor] What do you call those, pants? (laughing) (muffled speaking) (ominous music) (groaning) (ominous music) - Your turn. (groaning) (ominous music) - [Ben] That's good, just make a note of what time they activated the area. (muffled dispatching) (soft music) (gunshots) - They're back. (dog barking) (soft music) (muffled TV reporting) - What's wrong, Michael? Are you mad at me about something? (muffled TV reporting) - [Reporter] Tomorrow we're looking at a few sunny periods, mostly cloudy though, and more snow. - I'll be right back, okay? - [David] He didn't show. - What do you mean he didn't show? Were you there on time? Did you wait long enough? - I was there early. I waited for two hours, I froze my ass off out there. - He went to the bank, he must've shown up. - Okay, well you go back up there and you look. - Well, I didn't wait to see if he actually got the money. I mean, maybe he had some problem getting that much cash or maybe something happened to him on the way. - Maybe? What the hell good is maybe? - All right, shut up. Calm down, all right? We'll call him. Wait for me at the car. - David looks upset. - Yeah, yeah, he's got a personal problem he wants me to help him with. - You mean now? You mean you're gonna go be with David. - Martine, I'm not dumping you for David. - Well, that's what it feels like. Michael, things have changed since you've been hanging around David. You've been different. What's happened? What's happening? - I don't know what you're thinking, but it's not what you're thinking. - You never know what I'm thinking, Michael, because the only thoughts you're interested in are your own. - I don't have time right now for this conversation. - Make the time. Stay here with me. Tell David to go away. - I can't. - Listen, Ben. If these kidnappers are half bright, they're making their calls from public phones and never the same one twice. I mean, we got over 200 payphones in this town. But I've got the phone company working with us. - Great, all right, yeah, I'll get on it. They're getting a judge in Denver to issue the court order for the wire tap. And the phone company's gonna turn off half the pay phones in town, giving us a decent chance of patrolling the working ones. Now when we get those locations, I want three roaming units out there. We're getting there. - Okay. - They've got a phone at the Java Hut. - No, it's too crowded, someone could hear. There's one outside the library. (soft music) - No. No, I'm saving you. (soft music) I'm not going to die. (soft music) I gotta get these off. (soft music) Toolkit. (soft music) (phone ringing) - You remember what to say? - Yeah. (phone ringing) Hello. - Why didn't you drop off the money? - I couldn't find the spot. I drove exactly where you told me to go. One mile east on the Post Road. - Old Post Road. Not Post Road, Old Post Road. - You told me the Post Road. - We told you Old Post Road. - Well, I didn't understand, all right? - All right, we'll give you another chance. One mile east on Old Post Road, a piece of plywood on the shoulder. - It's snowing, what if I can't see it? Hello? Hello? Hello? - There's a speed limit sign just a few feet from there. We'll tie a garbage bag around the post. Leave the suitcase behind the sign, you understand? - Yeah, look. I've just got to know that my wife is okay. I've got the money, I want to give it to you. But could I talk to my wife first? - No, no, that's not possible. Just trust me, okay? - Trust you? I'm gonna trust you? You kidnapped my wife, man! - Please. Sir? Sir, you just have to trust me. Your wife is safe. - Look. You must understand what I'm going through here. I love my wife. I really want her back. I'll do anything. I'll meet you anywhere, I'll give you anything you want. But just bring Jan home, will you? - Can't do that. Are you gonna bring the money or not? - Yeah. (soft music) Sorry. I messed everything up, didn't I? - No, it's fine. This is the plan. One of these guys pretending to be you is gonna drive your car to the drop spot. - Wait a minute, Ben, wait a minute. Everybody in this town knows what I look like. What if the kidnappers are from around here? No, Ben, it's gotta be me behind the wheel, nobody else. - I don't think Agent Gray's gonna agree to put you at risk. - It isn't Agent Gray's wife who was kidnapped, was it? (soft ominous music) - Yeah, that's... That's the way he wants to go. Yeah, I agree with him, uh-huh. Yeah he's here, just hold on. Agent Hammond. - [Agent Hammond] Yes, sir. - All right, the new plan is this. You're gonna drive to the drop off point with Agent Hammond fully armed, concealed right behind you in the backseat. - Okay. - Okay. When you get there, drive by slowly like you're searching. Go ahead a quarter mile, turn around, and on the way back, slow it down again like you're looking for the sign post. Come straight back here, we wait for the next phone call. - Okay, I got it. - By then, the phone tap should be in place. - Yes, sir. Chief. - Thank you. (phone ringing) Go ahead. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Kevin] Hey Dad, how you doing? - Oh hey, Kev. Everything all right, son? - [Kevin] Yeah, just calling to say hi. I miss you guys. Are you on, Mom? - No, no, your mom's not here, she's-- - [Kevin] She usually picks up by now. - [Mark] Yeah, she's out. She's shopping. - [Kevin] When will she be back? - Soon. Well, later probably. She's got a lot of shopping. - [Kevin] Okay well, tell her I love her. - She loves you too, son. Look. I'm filling up the bathtub here. I'd better go. - [Kevin] Sure Dad, talk to you soon. Love you. - I love you too, son. (soft music) - Hey, drive carefully. - Sorry. - Check the odometer. After half a mile, start looking for the speed limit sign. - Okay. That's a bulletproof vest you're wearing? - Yes, it is. Don't worry, if we're fired on, you just drop down onto the seat and leave the rest to me. - Great. (soft music) - All right, stay back. We don't want to be caught in his headlights. (ominous music) - There it is. - Okay, remember our orders. - Yeah, I remember. - All right, get back, get back. (ominous music) Think he drove by. - Maybe it wasn't him. - No, he's turning around, he's turning around. Coming back this way, it's gotta be him. (ominous music) - Did he make the drop or what? - I don't know. I don't know, go look. Just go look. (ominous music) - [Officer] Wait, there's someone out there. - He didn't make the drop. He drove away. - I don't get it. - [David] What are we gonna do? - He turned around. I don't get it. This whole thing's blown. - [David] What are we gonna do, Michael? - I need to think. - Right, you'll figure out what to do. Just like with the computers, man. - [Officer] Going that way. (engine roaring) (soft music) - Don't fall asleep. Fall asleep, freeze to death. Oh, gotta stay awake. Stay awake. Gotta stay awake. Stay awake, stay awake. Stay awake or die. - [Agent Hammond] Good job, Mark. Now let me bring you up to date. - Exactly as instructed. Agent Gray finally got the court order. Next phone call comes in, we record it and trace. - My hand's shaking. I don't know if it's because I'm freezing or because I'm nervous. - You did great. - Captain Alpert, Agent Gray. - Thank you. Alpert. - I just got word from my men that two or more possible perpetrators were in the vicinity but they eluded capture. - Did they see them? See anything? - Yeah, a male. Age and race indeterminate. And a vehicle. Darkish color, make, model indeterminate. - They blew it. - Mr. Hale, my men are facing two enemies here. The perpetrators and the weather. So let's cut them a little slack, okay? - Yeah, right. - What we should be doing right now is gearing up for the next phone call. - How are you so sure there'll be another one? - I think there'll be one. - All right. What's the procedure? - They've blew it. - When the call comes in, obviously, it's important for Hale to engage the caller as long as possible. - [Ben] Okay, got it. (soft music) - I've decided. We should end it. - What? - It's time to walk away. - You're just gonna call the guy up and say, yeah, never mind? - No, no more phone calls. It's over. - Okay, what about Mrs. Hale? What are we gonna do about her? - Nothing. Nothing, somebody's bound to find her. We didn't hurt her. She's gonna be okay. - You gonna let them beat you like that? A guy like that, you're just gonna let him beat you. - No, he didn't beat me, all right? I'm getting out, it's my decision. - 'Cause he beat you. - He didn't beat me. - What, then you beat him? - Nobody beat anybody, it's a draw. - A draw? How do you call that a draw? He's got the money, we've got nothing! - Shut up! - Man. I believed in you. I thought you were the best. I would've done anything for you. - David. It is my belief that to continue this would not be smart. But if you want to see it through, I will see it through for you. - Yeah. I want to see this through, Michael. - Let's find a phone. - Why haven't they called? They're not gonna call. We're never gonna hear from them again. - I think they'll call. I hope they call. - Yeah, right. Jan called me this morning at the restaurant. Talking to me about her feelings. She never talks about her feelings. This morning, for some reason, I don't know, she... She wanted to. And I was busy, I was doing a million things and I... Anyway, she... She never got to say what she wanted to say. What if that was the last conversation I was gonna have with her? What if my last conversation with my wife was her trying to say something and I wasn't listening? (doorbell rings) - [Agent Hammond] Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I got it. - Go to the door, open it, and immediately drop to the floor. Go. - Okay, come on, come on. Okay, get to the other side with a gun. Freeze! - It's Hollander. - The dry cleaner. - Sorry we freaked you out, Mr. Hollander. We just don't know what to expect. (soft music) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) Remember, keep them talking as long as you can. - Right. (phone ringing) - [Officer] Okay, go ahead. - Hello? - Why didn't you leave the money? - I couldn't see anything. I couldn't find anything out there. - It's the only sign on the road. There's a light shining on it. We tied a great big trash bag on it. You couldn't have missed it. - Well, I did. Hello, hello, are you there? - Okay, look. Are you willing to try again? - Am I willing? You've got my wife. - That's right. And if you screw up again, she's gonna freeze to death. - Where have you got my wife? Have you got her outside? Where have you got my wife? - [Michael] Look, she's okay for now. We want to give her back to you. It is entirely up to you. - Okay. - It's 8:30. We will give you one hour to make the drop. Do not screw up this time. We have hired a neutral person to pick up the suitcase and deliver it to a prescribed location. This person knows nothing of the kidnapping. (phone beeping) - Got it. - What's all this stuff about a neutral person? - I just thought of it to cover you in case somebody sees you picking up the money. - It's good thinking, Batman. (ominous music) (muffled dispatching) (ominous music) - They said she could freeze to death which means they do have her outside. It's time to pay the money. - Cannot let you pay the money. - You cannot let me? I don't take orders from you. - Mr. Hale, I have a lot more experience in these things than you do, which is why I'm here. - But if my wife dies, you still get to go home to your family. - Guys, guys, listen. Just please. There's a compromise here. What if Mark takes the suitcase to the drop site but there's no money in it? Just a note demanding proof that Jan's all right. If there's something for them to pick up, then there's a chance for us to pick them up. And if there really is a neutral person, well still, we have to get some information. - Yeah, but what if you don't pick up this person, for whatever reason? Then the kidnappers find an empty bag with some cockamamie note on it. They'll think I'm jerking them around. - No, they already know you don't trust them. The interesting thing is that they trust you. They've never doubted you, never been suspicious. They'll believe your note. (soft music) - Mark. My sweet Mark. I know you're doing everything you can. (ominous music) - When we get to the drop site, just reach over, open the door, toss the bag out and keep driving. - Okay. (ominous music) - I'm gonna park at that old abandoned farmhouse, all right? Which means you're gonna have to walk about a quarter of a mile. If this is a trap, it'll be easier for you to disappear in the woods and make it back to the car, you got it? - Got it. (ominous music) - This is it up here. - Okay, slow down a little. Lean over and open the door. - I can't even see the side of the road. - Keep to the middle. Just toss the bag out, they'll find it. - Yep. What if they don't? - Don't stop. - I'm gonna put it where they said. - Mr. Hale. Where are you going? (ominous music) - It's 9:40, he must've made the drop by now. If he made the drop. - Think it's a setup? - I don't know. But if it is, just remember your story. You were hired to pick up that suitcase and that's all you know, all right? If we're both caught, we'll do the other story. - I wish we had the guns. We should've brought the guns. - No, our stories only work if we're unarmed. (ominous music) - Mark and Jan Hale. (ominous music) - [Officer] Suspect vehicle heading westbound, operate. (ominous music) Out of the vehicle! Now, now! (officers yelling) I said get down! (ominous music) - Where is it? Where is it? (ominous music) (clanging) (horn beeping) - Hello? (horn beeping) Hello? - You arrested Mrs. Hopkins? - She picked up the bag, Mark. They know it was a mistake, they've let her go. - But that means the bag is gone, Ben. So when the real guys got there, the bag wasn't there. - [David] He's screwing with us. Man, I could kill him. - I don't get it, I just don't get it. - Get what? He's screwing with us. - I don't know. This wasn't a setup. And he obviously hasn't involved the cops. What the hell is he doing? - You know what professionals would do right now? Professionals would send him one of her fingers. - David, shut up. (people mumbling) - You know. If these guys ever do call again, I don't know what the hell I'm gonna say to them. I don't have any excuses left, Ben. What do I tell them? If they want to know why the bag isn't there, what am I gonna tell them? - You'll just have to convince them that the bag is there. Mark, they've bought everything you've said so far. (phone ringing) Do it. You can do it. (phone ringing) Come on. (phone ringing) - Hello. - Where's the money? - [Mark] What? - The money, where's the money? I want to know where the money is. - Hey look, man, I dropped that bag exactly where you told me to drop it. How the hell could you miss it? What, are you guys stupid or something? What if somebody else came and picked it up? Look, I'll tell you something, man. It's gonna be hard for me to get another $100,000 at this time of night. - Okay, all right, look. Listen, we'll go back and look for it right now, okay? I'll call you back after we check it out, okay? - I can't believe this. - I'll call you back, okay? I'll call you back. - Yes. - Yeah! - Yes. - It was up there. How could you have missed it? Man, how could you have been so stupid? - You did it, you spooked them. They're gonna go right back into our trap. - I want to be there, I want to see it. - I don't think Agent Gray's gonna... The hell with Agent Gray. (phone beeping) You've earned it. - [Officer] Hey, great, Mark. (horn beeps) (soft music) (ominous music) - What if they send that neutral person they were talking about? - No such animal. They made it up. They got so thrown by your last conversation that they actually forgot about it. (ominous music) (dog barking) (ominous music) (yelling) - [David] Get off me, get him off! - [Officer] We have suspect in a grab, we got him. - Let's go. (officers yelling) - [Officer] On your feet. We got him. - He's a little boy. - I swear, it wasn't me. - [Officer] Keep quiet, that's enough, come on. - [David] I'm in a yellow Mustang. You gotta believe me, man. I didn't do it. - Move it. (ominous music) (engine rumbles) (sirens blaring) (officers yelling) - [Officer] Move it, open the door now! (muffled dispatching) Stay there. - I know that kid. He eats in our restaurant. Where's my wife? Where's my wife? Where's my wife? - Mark. - Where's my wife? - Mark, easy! Mark, we got him. Come on. (ominous music) All right. I'm Police Chief Alpert. And you tell me right now. Where is she? Where's Mrs. Hale? - I don't know. (soft ominous music) You're trying my patience here, kid. - I'm telling you, we were forced into this by terrorists. Okay? Now I don't know their nationality. I'm not good with accents. But they told us, and I believe them, that if we talk, they'll kill our families. - Your little buddy's been spouting off the same crap. Following the party line. I'd love to tell you he broke, but he didn't. He probably won't. He'll stick to the same stupid lie right to the end, just like a dumb little kid, which is what he is. You're supposed to be the smart guy. Haven't seen any evidence of that. But you can still prove it to me. If Mrs. Hale gets out of this alive, you still got room to bargain. Minimum sentence, minimum security. But if she dies, Michael, it becomes a federal crime and they will send you away for a very long time to a place where a bright, good looking young guy like you is lunch. Now, Michael. Right now. What's the smart thing to do? (soft ominous music) (sirens blaring) (dramatic music) - It's different. I mean, it's dark and there's all this snow. - Just tell us where to turn off. - I'm trying to it's just that I'm not... All right, it's around here. I'm not sure-- - Are you playing games with me again, you little punk? - No, I swear to God. I'm not sure where we are. (sirens blaring) - God, let her be alive. (sirens blaring) I'd love to be out there in that car with that rotten bastard. - I know. That's why you're not. - Over there, over there, that's it. That's the turnoff right there. (ominous music) - All right, where's the spot? - I don't see it. - It's not here! It's not here, Ben. He's led us on a wild goose chase. - No, we covered it up with branches. I don't see it. - If you're screwing with us, kid-- - I'm not. (ominous music) It's right there. - Jan, Jan! (officers yelling) Jan! Jan! Jan, Jan! She's in there, she's in there! Jan, Jan! It's locked! Jan, we're coming! - Keys, where are the keys? - My car. - Wait, I have keys. (intense music) Jan? I'm here, baby. - Mark? Am I alive? - Yeah, you're alive. Yeah. Yeah, baby, you're alive. You are, yes you are. She's okay, she's okay. - She's okay. - Come on. - Get these things off her. Here, baby. Let me get your blanket. There you go. There you go. - Did you save me, Ben? - Well, kinda. It was mostly Mark. (laughs) - I knew you would. - Let's go home, baby. Let's go home. (soft music) (soft dramatic music) (Multicom Jingle)
