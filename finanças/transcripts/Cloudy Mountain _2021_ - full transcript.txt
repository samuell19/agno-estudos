China's southwest region is home to the world's largest karst landforms. The ground is unstable and fragile, with many unstable rock formations. High-speed rail built here faces the lethal threat of geological disasters that can strike at any time. Tell me exactly what your concern is (Project By Railway Construction Corps) You checked it the day before Why again today? Such a waste of time Even with a girlfriend doing exploration, you can't use her like this Don't you think those birds are strange? Strange?

It said no water the day before, but there was so much water today I told you there might be danger Yes, I can understand it very well But what the problem is, right, we should clarify it Because, for the data, it does not mean it's always precise If there is an incident... What incident? Well, you should give a precise forecast Wait... Hey don't you leave! Excuse me How do you explain today? I acknowledge today's measurement is not same as the day before Then what is the pregeoforecast good for? You failed to detect the water! What responsibility should you take? What if there are deaths? We found the day before yesterday that in the tunnel the water belt 10 meters on the left There's no water in the front The conclusion was that no danger of sudden water Don't make any excuse It's your problem! Why yell at her?! The pregeoforecast can hold for two hours There are changes anytime in this mountain It is like a rotating restaurant inside, you know? Who knows! Are you trying to scare me? Who scares you? This amount of water disappeared suddenly This is quite abnormal Okay, Hong Yizhou, you are the director of the Blasting Office I won't argue with you about the explosives, I'm from the detecting work team I am talking about the problems in my team You don't have to represent your girlfriend to argue with me You understand, the Indian Ocean Plate earthquake belt is active now and having an impact on this area I know You handle this Okay Speak You're the director of the engineering section You should know the importance of the progress Leaking water is an accident Engineer He is detecting inside We'll take measures if there are problems It is serious?

She needs to go to hospital Why are we stopped? Girl, may I borrow your coat? Coat? Put it on, put it on The feathers flow that way There is wind, so there is an exit The wind comes from above Let's go Can you see? The wind comes from there I'll have a look What's the rush? Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Are you okay? Hold on! Hold on! Pull him back! Pull Don't let go! Kid, countdown by seconds See how many seconds can you count until it hits the ground Then tell me Okay One Two Three Three seconds 5 meters 1st second 15 meters 2nd second 44 meters deep Too deep! It's impossible to cross over Maybe we should go back Follow Grandpa Thank you, Grandpa You're my savior Not necessary What are you talking about? Now what? What's the matter? You're vomiting Help him up Such a large bump Probably intracranial hemorrhage Don't move Let me try We have to cross over Don't be nervous Stay still But you're a veterinarian He can... he will, if he treats you as a human The conditions are too bad here We can't operate on the head I can only dress your wound Are you climbing across on the top?

Are you alright? Hold on I can't pull any more Harder The 4th data set has arrived In my experience, within 72 hours, the sliding part will leave the base We must blast and clear it before it happens How? How do we do it? I need a design survey and and modeling test Enlarge the left part It takes at least 5 hours to have a final plan to you There are 72 hours left before the landslide occurs Your plan needs 5 hours You think you can do whatever you like? That is a mountain not a children's toy I need time to understand it The longer it takes, the higher the cost will be I don't want this outcome Call Mr. Lin National Rescue Command Center Ding Yajun Please explain to the leaders briefly what is 'blast and clear' Okay Considering the structure of the rocks we use a targeted blasting technique to move the most dangerous part of the mountain to the safe side, to reduce the loss This is blast and clear May I ask an outside question? Since it needs to blast, can we directly bomb the mountain? This is totally different Target blasting requires the position, the depth, the angle and the time to be very precise We can control each blasting point within milliseconds of time so as to achieve our goal I see You are victims and we are here to rescue Anything you need, feel free to tell us We will fully support you Let's go Hurry Hold still Be careful Take it, these are high explosives High explosives must be checked closely Let's go Anything else? No more Anything else in the car hopper? No Hong Yizhou! Hong Yizhou! Who's there? Dad! You stay there! Wait for me! Amazing Dad, how are you? Still alive Come on Are you okay? I'm alright Why are you here alone? I had no time to notify others There was a crash outside A crash? Is the tunnel in danger? Why are you here? You should be in the tunnel I'm here to save you What? I said, we have to go up right now to find the exit Go up from here Go! Go! 10:49 pm Tunnel Damaged, Bridge Damaged Five hours for such a poor test I'm not sure what the problem was... If... If we could sacrifice a part of the tunnel maybe it's possible Don't even think about it Everyone, we are modifying the plan Please finish your meal now and stand by for call up Everyone, We are modifying the plan, Please finish your meal now and stand by for call up Have some while it's warm I'm not hungry Thanks With Engineer He, don't get angry I know China Railway Construction Receiving data I've tried to find the expeditions you need I am asking for those who entered the cave... Ms. Ding and Engineer He The sensors laid by Hong Yizhou are still receiving data Super hero, the entrance you came in is really blocked? Then can we get out? My phone is going to be dead soon Let's save energy Speak less Why did you hide in the truck? You snuck out Dad doesn't allow me to play games He beats me too I want to go to my Granny's This is an intersection Here's a whirlpool Grandpa, Which way? Let me see Go this way Wrong direction The exit is this way Why that way? Let me tell you With my 40 years of experiences Dad... In 1981, I was the monitor then Dad... My superior and I lost our way during the exploration All the way, we went against the wind to get out of the cave The wind comes from here Dad... So... Could you put these on please? I don't want to yell at you again Put them on please Please Was it summer or winter? Summer It is winter now! What about winter? Temperature inside barely changes It's hotter outside so the air flows inward, if outside is colder then the air flows outward So wind goes opposite You are wrong With my fellows, we went against the wind, all the way here We happened to meet you, so the direction is correct Because the temperature outside was still high So you went against the wind, it was okay, but now it is late night The temperature outside is close to zero, Do you understand? Go this way I wish you were right Ms. Ding, here is a soft rock belt It is moving It is proper to lay explosives here Just here Load the data in Test Successful, Tunnel Intact: 100% High-Speed Train Bridge Intact: 100% This is the new plan The new plan won't damage the bridge Right Very good. This is very good. Now let's go. Start! Go! Start! Okay! Let's go! Stop! Slowly Hurry up guys Slowly Come on guys Good luck guys Lu Xiaojin Wait! Keep in touch Okay Be safe Don't worry The data you found today is important Well done Hong Yizhou did this He is not bad No news is good news I believe he is safe Drink slowly It's alcohol I know you miss it Real antifreeze solution Ms. Ding, you know my temper We share the same feelings I understand Now, I worry about Hong Yizhou and his group These stones are so beautiful Hurry up What are these white things? Gypsum crystal flower Catch up Watch your step If we can't get out Insurance means nothing It looks like a crash soon Be quick We can only stop at the big cavity, go Go Are you sure the exit is over there? What's wrong? The air flow has slowed There might be a crash behind What? Nothing I didn't hear you clearly What I am sure is, we can't go back only forward I know You stay here, I'll go down to have a look No way No way What's it like there? No way out there Wait Say it again I said there is no way out Only a water pool But I don't think we're wrong I just had a look The water level wasn't high It just rose up and blocked this exit No way here We have to find another way We can detect a way out Dad, are you kidding? We have no oxygen bottle, no breathing machines and no other equipment How do we detect a way out? No equipment except ourselves Yizhou, you can't do this now? I taught you rock climbing as well as swimming You can stay in the water without breathing for 50 meters I know you can What? What's the problem? No, Dad I have no idea how far is it to the outside and I don't know if there is a cavity in the middle How do I detect a way out? No way to detect... You are afraid of water I mean we can wait We can wait here, we just wait here It is the safest and the best way How can we wait? Up there, crashes are occurring This exit might be blocked too There are several lives here That insurance man has a head wound He's bleeding Is this the wrong way? There is a kid there How can we wait? Can't you say something positive? You're afraid of water You're scared to go down I'll do it Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Don't be absurd Are you trying to die? How come I have a son like you? Soft, cowardly, I want to help Grandpa Stay here This son is good for nothing His father has to do everything I always see my mom in the water Mom, we'll be at the hospital soon Don't worry Dad isn't here, but I'm with you Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom is in the water, but I can't save her I know From childhood to adulthood, you hardly acknowledged me I am over 30 now I am always wrong in your eyes Whatever I do is always wrong Because... Because I drowned my mom Yizhou, I never blamed you You were only twelve You were just a kid How could I blame you? You don't blame me? You never blamed me in your mind? Can you say in your mind you never blamed me? You know, I can't get in the water, not because I'm soft, not because I'm soft I can't get in the water because in the water I'll see mom She's struggling I'll want to grab her, but I can't I can't No matter what I do, I can't grab her Why? Tell me why!? I called you Why didn't you come home? Why didn't you answer my call? Why didn't you answer the phone? There was a landslide, there was gushing mud, I had to go help Help? Were you the only one who could help? Were you the only one?! You were needed at home You are my only father You are the only husband of my mom She needed you to take her to hospital... She needed you to take her to hospital Lu Xiaojin, I finally found an expert who's been to the underground river Call him now, and find the exit Hello I'll send two people with you to bring Hong Yizhou back Be careful Ms. Ding, the other exit of the underground river was sent to the rescue team As we are short of men to blast and clear I'll go myself Alert. New Crash Detected The water level is dropping down quickly How come? Something is wrong The direction of the landslide... Ms. Ding, something happened at Sun Guowei's place Someone was injured by a falling rock Cut to the big screen This is out of nowhere We're not prepared How come? This is real time data The rock structure of the mountain changed suddenly in an hour What we saw before is not what it is now We made the wrong choice The landslide direction is now towards the town The total mud volume could be up to 30 million cubic tons 50 tons of weight Why didn't you find it last night? The crack was deeply hidden It wasn't detected until it started to move The data sent back by the satellite confirmed this change The satellite data says the Yundang Mountains landslide is changing its direction, moving 130 millimeters towards Yunjiang Town direction The mountain top will slide down within 2 hours taking only three minutes before it hits the town Not only will the town be destroyed, but it could threaten the chemical plant nearby Initiate the national emergency response plan All troops take action to evacuate people! You must pay close attention All other departments get ready for orders at anytime to take further actions (Disaster Relief Command Center) Yes (January 29th, 7:30 am) Fellows and folks, everyone from Yunjiang Town! I am Governor Ling Xufeng! I'm asking each of you to follow instructions and leave in an orderly fashion, right now! Leave everything behind but save people! Only if we survive can we rebuild our homes! We must survive! We must trust the Party and the government! This is the right choice! Now follow us! All workers on the mountain come back to support rescue in the town We'll send out as many as possible Ms. Ding, an urgent notice from the weather center A heavy storm is arriving sooner than expected When? Any minute Follow them! Hurry up! Follow them! Hurry! Teacher! Don't be afraid! Why are you still here? Hurry! Control Center! Survivors were found in the water Flying over now! Survivors found near a sinkhole Copy that! Rescue team is on their way! More survivors in the cave! More rescue support needed! Hurry up! Water level is increasing Hong Yizhou and the rest are all safe now and they are on the way to the hospital Ms. Ding, too many people won't be able to escape the town in time What? What should we do? Damage Probability: 95% It seems there's only one way... Place the explosives... in the tunnel You mean blast the tunnel? We've been working on it for over 10 years It's nearly finished and you want to destroy it? The shock wave from the tunnel will divert the rocks from Luzhang Mountain into the space between Yunjiang Town and Yundang Mountain, forming a barrier Destroy the tunnel?! What is wrong with you? What are you talking about? What's kind of idea you got? Are you crazy? Saving people is important, but we can't destroy the tunnel It's built too strong to blast If..if no one was saved... This is science! You shut up! The data shows it is the only way! The only way! You shut up! This is your solution? If you want, you can quit Can you do your job? Keep calm I can understand your feelings Yes, but this high speed rail, this tunnel, is the property of the country The local people are relying on this tunnel to bring business here Where is your brain? Find another solution Engineer He, you're set to retire in two months, When the tunnel is finished, it will be a perfect time for you to retire Stop him But this is really, the only way This will be the last tunnel I build in my lifetime My patella got broken here in this tunnel Now, as it is nearly completed, we are using our own hands to destroy it Your plan, what's the success rate? With this amount of explosives, the success rate is above 45% In Western culture, when disaster hit, they relied on Noah's Ark Our ancestors believe Jingwei filled up the sea with pebbles We can remove a mountain Double the explosives Blast it! Watch out! Don't fall! Someone's here! All trapped people are rescued They're on the way to the emergency center Arrival in 15 minutes No casualties Copy that Now that we're on the helicopter to the hospital, I'd like to thank all the kind and brave people The helipad is ready The sky is clear Send wounded to the operation room Copy it Dad Have something warm I've never had coffee in my life Have some, Dad Just a little Son Come on, you take some to warm up yourself I'm fine dad Come on, drink it Come on Okay Then, I'll drink Captain Roger Can you do me a favor? Please connect to the frequency of the project department No problem We won't go! We won't go! We can save the others But no way will you blast it! You go if you want I'll never do it You say it, then we do it? Are you sure we can save them by blasting it? Blast here, blast there What do you administrators do? Yeah! No way! No Way You need to listen! The tunnel is our sweat and blood We won't destroy it Never! We won't do it! No! No! No! Guys, calm down! Let Ms. Ding finish The feeling we have for this tunnel is the same as you This tunnel we've been working on or over 10 years It's a decade of hardship and achievements But now... we have to blast it! Because it is the only way to save the town right now The 160 thousand people in Yunjiang Town can't be evacuated from the town in two hours We have no other choice Our first choice is to save people Our predecessors were rail soldiers and they are the group that sacrificed the most in the era of peace Today we are still an army who can fight and who will sacrifice If a tunnel is destroyed, we can burrow it again If a bridge is broken, we can connect it again In the worst scenario, it costs us another 10 years I have a wife and kids and I've been thinking, if my family was there, they'll be waiting to be rescued Go! Thanks to everyone! Let's go! Let's go! Let's do it! I'm coming! Ms. Ding, Hong Yizhou asked me to forward you an idea Beside Yundang Mountain is a hill named Niuguan Hill If we put the explosives there, blast that hill first, it would form a better barrier between the town and Yundang Mountain This could save the town Come on! He said the Niuguan Hill Crack is deep enough for a blast Ms. Ding, if we could put the explosives in this hill, the success rate increases to 90% Connect me to the helicopter Okay The cave entrance is at a negative angle The helicopter can't approach it We can only try the anchor point from far away Try it Okay It's done Zhao Qiao! He's injured! Pull him up! Control Center! The rocks at the entrance are too soft to hook up We can't make it If we can't plant the explosives there, this plan will fail Captain We're closer to the cave entrance I can climb there to plant the explosives We have orders, we can't get involved This isn't us going against anything We're doing this to save lives and save the tunnel and the town You try to get as close as you can and drop me down I'm the only one who can do this now Trust me I've climbed up Mount Everest Dad, I'm determined to do something extraordinary If it were you, you'd definitely do it Dad Follow them Follow them Hurry! Hurry up! Follow closely! Get in the cave! Go inside! Hurry! Hurry! Follow them! The cave entrance is at a negative angle I can't approach it There is a platform in the direction of 2 o'clock I'll drop you there Okay Hong Yizhou, you know that once you get there you might not be able to come back I know But it's worth ti Dad See you soon Are you ready? 8:52 am You served in the army? Dad!? Why are you here? You can't make it alone We have to work together Come on! Ms. Ding, 600 KG of explosives are ready I'll come with you and two blast experts Ms. Ding! Ms. Ding! Send someone else! You stay here to command! I have to stay with my soldiers! Ms. Ding... Engineer He, listen to me You now have my authority If I can't finish the job, the tunnel, you give orders for blasting No... You are an old rail soldier Stay here, everyone trusts you Come back safe Girls and boys, I know you all feel cold and scared But we won't give up, right? We have to hang on so the rescue team will find us and save us out If you feel cold, just rub your hands Aunty, I don't want to cry, I just can't control it I know you are from the mountains You can sing songs Who will sing a song? Can you teach me to sing? Who can sing me a song, okay? Mom says if you have a wish speak it out loudly to the deep valley It will respond to you with the echo of power It will accompany you Mom says If you have a wish speak it out loudly to the deep valley It will respond to you with the echo of power It will accompany you and sing together with you The valley says I want to go far away to the end of the sky to bring back an everlasting sun to brighten every corner of my hometown Be brave and move forward you will be able to see hope hope Qi Lei, for Chinese PLA man, Air Force Warcraft Pilot Hong Yizhou was in my plane just now I have requested to lead I'll take charge of this temporary flight Find the foot support point first, then the hand point Captain Can we get closer to offer some help? No, it's too dangerous to get that close to the mountains The air flow from us will impact their safety Dad We can't get across I'll be your foot support No! No way! Dad, even if you support me I may not reach that point Today is the happiest day since my retirement As an old soldier, if I could be some help... Son...

They took on major arterial projects of China's railway system, as well as national infrastructure projects such as highways and airports. On projects like the Chengdu-Kunming and Xiangyang-Chongqing Railways, approximately one rail soldier died on every kilometer built. On the hills where many tunnels exit lie the graves of fallen rail soldiers. The Railway Corp had the highest casualty among all military units at peacetime. On January 1, 1984, the Railway Corp was reformed, transforming into the global industry enterprise known as China Railway Construction Corporation The people of China will always remember their name.
