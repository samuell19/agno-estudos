“The only reward I ask for, “which must be promised me before a hand is laid on my work, “is that my paintings will always be seen next to immortal works." THOUGHTS AND VISIONS OF A SEVERED HEAD I the undersigned, Antoine Wiertz, artist, philosopher and painter, hereby declare that after my death I wish my body to be embalmed in the so-called "Egyptian” manner. Before that, my heart shall be removed and embalmed separately, then placed in a silk bag knotted with a pink ribbon. As for the rest, I wish to spend my life depicting impossible beauty. I want the public to feel unsettled before my paintings, for some to tear at their hair, unable to express the feelings that grip them, for young women to faint, and for children to flee, screaming out in terror. A monumental studio must be built to house the immense pictures I have decided to paint. In exchange for the cost of the construction, the state will become the owner of all my works. I ask that after my death this workshop become a museum in which my paintings must be exhibited for ever more. It is to this temple that I invite all those who would meditate in solitude on the forming of my art. “The painter Antoine Wiertz “has sent to the Louvre his large and heavy paintings, “which threaten to fall onto the museum-goers. “His efforts to impress his public “should not let him forget “that large dimensions do not equal grandeur." Edmond Von Offel, La Revue d'Art, 1842. “Monsieur Wiertz is not to be scorned as an artist, “and there is something of the painter about him. “But with this Cyclopean confusion of arms and legs, “he has crossed the line between the sublime and the ridiculous.” Pierre Ménard, Le Courrier Français, 1840. Ladies and gentlemen, we shall now begin the visit. Would you be so kind as to not touch the works of art, and to maintain the silence that befits the respect due to a great genius. Here first of all is a painting by means of which the painter invites us to meditate. In fact, it is both a rigorous pictorial study and an evocation of the spiritual life. This painting is called The Young Witch, and provides us with the spectacle of a young and voluptuous creature being initiated into Satanic practices. An old crone dressed in black lurks in the darkness behind her, whispering in her ear some cruel and painful confession. But she remains impassive, a prisoner of her childhood dreams. And nothing could ever disturb her loneliness. Yet... The Suicide, oil painting. Disgusted with life, his heart empty, his mind vacant, this handsome young man said to himself, “I want to die." As his head, blown away by the bullet, explodes in several pieces... the Angel of Death, whose hand holds a second pistol, primed to fire, smiles at his triumph. The suicide's body collapses next to the Good Angel, who prays and cries at the same time. A farewell letter reveals to us the philosophy which brought about the end of this pure soul: materialism! You can also see here to what extent the painter valued the moral duty of the artist, and the admonitory virtues of his work. This was equally true for the series to which he dedicated many nights of toil, which is called Thoughts and Visions of a Severed Head. Seeing the guillotine at work, I asked myself the following question: "Does the severed head “retain the faculty of thought for a few seconds?" At the time, a man was condemned to be executed. Accompanied by Professor Clovis Trouille, I managed to slip under the scaffold. We awaited the fatal moment which would bring us the head. Suddenly we heard the horrible blade send the head into the red sack. Our hair stood on end, but this was not the time to flinch. My companion seized my hand, led me to the pulsing head and spoke to it. “What do you feel? “What do you see?" With horror we realized that the head could still see, suffer, think and even speak short phrases. He asked why his head was burning and turning on itself, as though it were thrown into a fire. He felt as if he were stretching his hands toward his face, but never reaching it, never touching the torturous wound. He said he could see his mother's corpse putrefying. He asked for help, screaming in pain. Then he became incoherent. Through a hideous smile, the head coughed up blood. It desperately tried to catch its breath, to rejoin its body. Finally it went still, the face illuminated by an insane grin. “This painting is the work of a madman or an imposter. “Monsieur Wiertz's macabre jokes amuse no one but himself, “and one can really judge his talent “when one knows that his first monumental work “was given to a provincial grocer “as the prize in a raffle." JErôme Tonnerre, La Revue des Trois Mondes, 1846. Art critics are asses. To prove this, I anonymously sent two paintings to the competition of the Beaux-Arts in Paris. They were refused. One of them was an authentic Rubens. Criticism as regards art is impossible. Write, then, all the ill you wish about my works. You will never equal the ill I think of myself, as a result of the high standards I set myself. I wish to dedicate my life to this new religion. I shall sacrifice everything. I shall exhibit a courage, a constancy and a heroism worthy of the finest ancient virtues. I take the oath never to sell a single painting except for a few portraits to pay my way. An art that is sold is an art of prostitution. The public are nothing but ignoramuses who at times praise ignoble works to the skies, and at others scorn masterpieces. The glory to which I aspire is on another level, and I await a more glorious theater in which to make my virtues shine. Talent does not lie in one's facility at imitating nature. I dream of another kind of painting, of an art more abstract through being more faithful to reality. For painting is but a transitory stage, a preparation, a toy... It will soon be replaced by a more serious art, by the imitation of life itself. And I shall be the one who perfected this definitive painting process. Initial tests have already given me great hope. It is as if life itself has seized the canvas, and the person will soon start speaking and moving, and take your hand to drag you even further away. But, alas, these first works quickly vanish. The colors fade, the lines of force diminish. The medium itself falls to pieces and all must be begun again. Yet I am not giving up hope. I work the same motifs day and night. I relentlessly pursue the great picture of eternal suffering. Hunger, madness and crime are the edifying motifs by means of which the painter moves us. What, in fact, could stir the heart more than the sight of these little angels, bruised by authentically everyday dramas? What greater lesson could be given to the century's moralists? What worthier goal for a work dedicated to virtue and the love of mankind? Yet the painter launched himself towards a new conquest: the immortal woman, the source of all pain and all pleasure. Art was invented by men as a means of doing without women. That is why I only want them veiled, artificial, dumb, out of reach, like my paintings themselves, at a cold distance, always less than the luxury of which I dream. I am the absolute master of their painted bodies and I could count all those I have taken in this way, at the cost of strenuous work trying to seize the impossible. There is no woman whom I cannot, if I so wish, bed on my canvas. When visitors to my studio claim to be shocked by certain paintings, I maintain that there are few paintings as moral as mine. Yet I have decided, in my studio, to hang my strongest works behind a thick wooden door, through which a hole has been bored. I hope that future generations will benefit from this set-up, whose advantage is to inspire a feeling of guilt in the viewer. My art is not political, but philosophical. It will serve no revolution. It IS the revolution. A new life, which feeds as much on horror as on the sublime. They who refuse to see some of my works do not know what life is. They believe they can still tell the beautiful from the ugly. “Monsieur Wiertz is one of those who believe provocation “is proof of genius. “Yet he cannot draw “and his stupidity is as great as his giants." Charles Baudelaire, Fusées, 1865. The insults I suffer are also a great chance for me, for they keep me unwaveringly focused on my ideal. This is why I've placed these words over the entrance to my studio: “He who dreams in a meadow should be resigned “to hearing asses braying all around him." I feel I have never painted but the preface to my work. Illness weakens me more every day and I look desperately upon the miserable works I've painted. How will history be able to judge me when I have barely begun? I have ideas for even more terrible pictures, but I don't know if I'll have time to paint them. For the rest, I bequeath to glory my modest paintings and exhort future generations never to tolerate the slightest hindrance in their difficult quest to conquer beauty. Antoine Wiertz died on June 18, 1885. This film must later be replaced by a better one. Doing better is only a matter of time. Subtitles by Howard Bonsor Subtitling by TVS - TITRA FILM
