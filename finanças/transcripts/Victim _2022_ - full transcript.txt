You got something to drink? Thanks. -Good evening. -Good evening. We're merging the cars into one lane. There's a broken-down bus in front. So, cars will go first, then buses. Alright, nothing we can do. Good evening. There's a broken-down bus in front. We'll have to wait. The toilet is on the bus. If you need a smoke, don't stray too far. -Thanks. -He's saying a bus broke down. -How long are we gonna wait? -Probably four to five hours. -Open the baggage hold. -I warned you. I'll just take my stuff. -Excuse me. -Jesus. Where are you going? Hey, be careful. Are you going to Czechia? -Good evening, are you going to Czechia? -We're not. -Good evening, are you going to Czechia? -No, we aren't. Are you going to Czechia? -Are you going to Czechia? -We are. My son is in surgery. I need to get to him, but my bus is all the way in the back. I'm looking at a five-hour wait. I'll cover the gas. -I'm sorry, but it's a no-go. -I'll pay for three full tanks. Excuse me, my son is in the hospital. Could you please drive me to Czechia? -Hey. -Is he up yet? -No. -Will they let me in? SURGERY -Good evening. -This is the boy's mother. Come in. Though I shouldn't be doing this. Thank you. You stay here, please. -Fuck, I can't close the window. -It doesn't matter. Don't leave anything in the car. Where did they find him? Let me show you. The neighbours found him. You can bring them his passport and insurance card tomorrow. I wanna be there when he wakes up. You need to rest. You can go as soon as you wake up. -I'll stay with you tonight, okay? -What are you taking care of me for? I asked you to take care of Igor. All you had to do was call him twice a day. It happened at night. What was I supposed to do? I told you he could stay at my place. You're not going anywhere until you've eaten something. -Hey. -Mom? Hey. Are you feeling better? A bit. If you're in pain, if you need anything, just go ahead tell me. Everybody is sending you their best. You'll be home in a few days. I'll be back soon. Soon. Thank you. With pleasure. I'm Captain Novotný. Violent Crimes Unit. Are you Irina Zyrchenko, mother of Igor Zyrchenko? The doctor says your son was assaulted. The neighbour who found him heard someone running out of the building. We're investigating the incident as a case of grievous bodily harm. Could you please tell me what you know so far? He'd just woken up. I didn't want to ask him right away. Where were you at the time of the incident? In Ukraine. Why? I was taking care of some paperwork. We're trying to get Czech citizenship. Why didn't you take your son along? He had school and practice. He's a competitive gymnast. -His father? -He left us. We're not in touch. -Is he also Ukrainian? -Yes. Is he living in the Czech Republic? I don't know. What do you do? Housekeeping. So, both you and your son are Ukrainian nationals at the moment? Yes. -I'm sorry, but does it matter? -Maybe. Maybe not. The prosecutor has asked me to question Igor. It'll be just a few questions. The doctor agrees. Igor. Igor, this is Mr. Novotný, from the police. He would like to ask you some questions. Hi, Igor. Do you remember what happened? Did someone beat you up? Don't worry. You're safe now. Do you know who it was? How many were there? Three. Do you know what they looked like? Were they from the house? I don't know. Were they white? Don't be afraid. Thank you. I'll come back when Igor's feeling better. Attaboy. They'll find them soon. Come on, keep playing! Fuck. Come on! C'mon, pass it. Pass the ball! -Good afternoon. -Hi. Where's your mom? -She's not home yet. -You're flooding us. -There's no way. -Is anyone in the shower? -No. -No? Don't lie to me, I can hear it. -Shut the valve! -But there's no leak. I have water dripping through my ceiling! But it's not coming from us. -Then who? -I don't know. Stop the shower! You hear me? Open the door. Are you deaf? Open the door! The emperor builds new settlements while keeping in mind the spiritual support of the new Czech state. -Did you talk to the cops about my boy? -No. -Did your son? -No. Then why did they take him in? -I don't know. -He's still at the station. -That's not my fault. -Why'd you shut our water off? -You were flooding us again. -Then talk to the caretaker -and don't harass my kids. -What's going on? Everything okay? I'm just telling the Ukrainian lady her son didn't get beat up for nothing. -What did you say? -Are you deaf? -Go home. -Why? We're just talking here. -House meeting. -I'm calling the police. Go fuck yourself! And you don't ever mess with my kids again! Should I call the police? Honza heard it all through the door. -Is everything okay? -Yes. Are you sure? -Good night. -Good night. -Good morning. -Good morning. What are you greeting her for? You know her? Thank you for coming. I just need to check a few things. Was your first citizenship application denied because you had debts? -It wasn't because of debts. -Then why? I'd made a mistake on my tax return. I paid immediately, but we were denied anyway. Do you have any debts now? No, I don't. Where did you get the money for your hair salon? I have a business. I've been cleaning dorms, offices, and apartments for a few years. Of course, I couldn't afford it by myself. I'm starting the salon with a friend. Thanks. Is that it, or do you want to see my tax return? No need. Has Igor had any problems with anyone lately? In the neighbourhood, at school or at practice? No. My son is a decent kid. I understand. I have kids, too. But, believe me, if you'd seen as many surprised parents as I have, you'd be asking the same questions. Anything else, or can I go now? I'll drop by the hospital again. I'll let you know in advance. Thank you for coming. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Take care, man. -Thanks, bye. You're next. Hey. How are you feeling? What is that? My friend Michal has just texted me that he has a present for Igor. He'll be here in five minutes. -I hope you don't mind. -I don't. He's a gymnast, too. He's really rooting for you. I have it written down somewhere. -Thanks. -I think it's on Wednesday. Hi, Michal! Hi. -Good afternoon. -Michal Selský. -Selský, nice to meet you. -Irina. -Do you want a coffee? -Yes, with milk, please. -Sure. You? -No, thanks. Okay. Sorry. How is he? -Better. -That's great. I've got something for him. This is my old junior jersey. -I thought it could cheer him up. -We can't accept this. Yes, you can. It doesn't fit me anyway. Thank you. Here you go. Mrs. Zyrchenko, I grew up in your neighbourhood. I don't live there anymore. I'm in college in Brno. But my parents still do. You can't imagine how many times my friends and I got beaten up as kids. Have the cops found anyone yet? They've arrested our neighbour, but Igor said there were three of them. I have a friend in Brno. His wife works for the broadcaster. -I could give him a call. -I'd rather you didn't. -Why not? It would help spread the word. -It's a great idea. Maybe someone saw something. Listen, it's just an idea for now. First, I have to find out if he's even willing to get involved. After that, I'll call you, and you'll decide. Agreed? Who was that girl? Which one? -The one with the curly hair. -She's a friend. -Just a friend? -Mom… -Just a friend. -Okay, okay. Okay. How much longer are they gonna keep me here? A couple of days, for sure. Am I gonna miss training camp? This time, you probably are. -But I'll be able to continue practising? -Of course. Not right away, but later, for sure. The doctor says you're getting better. Tomorrow, they'll probably move you to a regular room. You'll be allowed to have your cell phone, laptop, books… Whatever you need, just tell me, and I'll bring it. -Okay. -Think about it. This way. The ribs are significantly fractured on one side. The shock created pressure on his internal organs. Most remained protected, but one of the kidneys was so damaged, we had to remove it. -Will there be any long-term consequences? -Just a moment. Valenta speaking. I'll call you back. I'm sorry. All the blood previously filtered through two kidneys will now be filtered through just one. The blood flow rate will double. But don't worry. Lots of people are living normal lives with one kidney. He does gymnastics, you know. Rings. Will he be able to continue practising? Any bad landing or hard impact could be very dangerous. I would advise against it. -Hi. -Good afternoon. -The window, right? -Yeah. -Hi. -Hi. -How is he? -Better, thankfully. Good. -It'll be done by tonight. -Thank you. -It's just a snapped wire. -It happens. Thanks. Aren't you afraid to stay there now? We have a few vacant rooms left. -I'm alright. -Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, just say the word. Go check out. -We're waiting for our ride. -Then go wait in the lobby. So you're not in the way in case someone wants to cook. Have you found a new apartment? We're moving to Olomouc. Ivan got a job there. -We'll manage somehow. -That's great! Irina. -Have a nice day. -You too. Bye. Leave it outside the rear entrance. Yeah. They hung wet laundry on it until it rotted and started to mildew. And then they'll call the inspectors on me. Excuse me, Marta. Just so I don't forget. I need a day off on Friday. Again? -I have that language exam. -Yeah. Well, if someone takes your shift, sure. Of course they will. I'll ask Janka. -What about your business? Any news? -Not yet. We're viewing a place today. -But I've had other concerns. -Well, you'll see. And if it doesn't work out, you can always come back here. Come see me later. I'll give you the money from last time. Okay? Thank you. Thirty square meters. Brand new wiring. Seems perfect for a hair salon, doesn't it? -Nine thousand including with utilities? -Without. It looked better in the photos. Listen, it's take it or leave it. Make it 8,000 with utilities and we can sign the contract. -Eight and a half, utilities excluded. -Eight. I'll prepare the paperwork. I was in the neighbourhood yesterday. It hasn't changed at all. I was also gonna ask you… I created a Facebook event called "March for Igor." I hope you don't mind. Michal, don't take this the wrong way, but… Why are you helping us? What if tomorrow they beat you up? Or my mom? And no one does anything about it? You know how many people have signed up since yesterday? 721. And there will be more. Are you ready? Good luck. We'll shoot it here. Here, right here. I'll be asking very simple questions. I'll ask about your son's condition, about you, about your life as a Ukrainian in the Czech Republic. Whether you've had any trouble… Thanks. Whether you've had any trouble with the Romani. Be sure to invite people to the march. It'll work. If you have anything to add, feel free, okay? If you make a mistake, go ahead and stop. We'll do another take. Okay, just turn a little bit. Great. Ready? Could you describe how you felt after your son's incident? I… I don't understand why they did it. They didn't even rob him, they just… beat him up. Igor is a decent boy. He has never hurt anyone. I just don't understand. You know, he's… He's great at gymnastics. He really enjoys it. But now he's gonna have to quit. If anyone saw something, please report it to the police. I'm very grateful to everyone coming to the march. I really appreciate it. The nurse says you gave an interview on TV. Is that true? Why? What if someone saw something and they'll call the police? That would be good. -What about the march? Is that you, too? -No. -Mom, I don't want this. -What don't you want? I don't want everybody to know. -Igor, don't worry, I'll sort it out. -But I don't want you to sort it out. -I'm not just gonna leave this alone. -Didn't you hear me? -I don't want you getting involved. -If I don't, nobody will. A Ukrainian gets beaten up by gypsies. Do you think anyone cares? People will talk about it for a while and then forget it, but I won't. I won't. I fell. -Igor, don't worry about it. -My hand slipped. Seriously, you have no need to worry. Just rest. I didn't get beaten up. Right, that's why you're lying here with just one kidney. I was hanging from the railing, and my hand slipped. I didn't know what to do. Everybody was saying I'd got beaten up, so I went along with it. I didn't know you'd get so involved. Igor, look at me. Igor! Did they beat you up? Then what happened? I was hanging from the railing, and my hand slipped. Why? What do you mean, why? -Why were you hanging from the railing? -I don't know. I just felt like it. You just felt like hanging from the… You walked out of the apartment just to hang from the handrail? Igor, do you think I'm crazy? Were you with somebody? Who? A friend. Boy or girl? The one with the curly hair? Igor, should I go ask her? -Yes, it was her. -Did she hurt you? No. -Could we have some privacy, please? -I have to give Igor his pills. I'm sorry, Mom. You're sorry? I let you stay because I thought you were a sensible young man, but you… Do you realize how much you've screwed up? I didn't mean to. -Why did you say you got beaten up? -I don't know, I was afraid. -Afraid of what? -Afraid that you'd be angry at me. Igor, do you realize that you lied to the police? They arrested a boy because of you. You'll explain everything to the policeman and apologize, got it? Irina, look at that handsome guy down there. You could use one like him. What are you doing? The news is on. Alright, one more? Bottoms up. Cheers! Listen, he can play chess. I saw them playing on Eurosport. It's a sport, too. You'll be set up for life. I'm done. You gonna want some more? Sure, why wouldn't I? Look. That house looks just like yours. Screw you. -What's that stench? -It's not a stench. It's a smell. It really is a stench. -And it's mango, by the way. -Whatever. I don't want any more. Well, I do. Irina, everything's gonna be fine, don't worry. He'll get over it. What matters now is that you don't give up. Got it? They'll catch those gypsies and throw them in jail. And that one neighbour who's always covering for them, he'll go right along. C'mon. Irina. What's wrong? Are you wasted? -Irina. -He made it up. Who? -Igor. -He made up what? They didn't beat him up. What do you mean? Fuck. He had a girl over. He was showing off and… Fuck, he hung himself from the handrail and fell. They're looking for three Romani boys. But there's not a single one. -That's fucked up. -It is. Sveta, it's fucked up. Does anyone know? Nobody knows, right? Then forget it. If no one knows, everything is alright. They've arrested our neighbour. Fuck it! Forget about him. Serves him right. Better him than Igor, right? He'd have ended up in prison anyway. Don't worry. Drink up. Listen, if there's no evidence, they'll let him go. They're not gonna hold him for a year. Just try not to mess things up, like Igor did. Or you'll make it even worse. It's starting. …to solve the case as soon as possible. -I don't understand why they did it. -Irina. They didn't even rob him, they just… beat him up. Igor is a decent boy. He has never hurt anyone. You know, he's… He's great at gymnastics. He really enjoys it. But now he's gonna have to quit. Well… If anyone saw something, please report it to the police. I'm very grateful to everyone coming to the march. I really appreciate it. Nice. Don't twist your arms so much. Try again. -Hello. -Hello. -I'm looking for Lenka Kadlecká. -Her session starts in about ten minutes. -She has some homework for Igor. -Got it. She might be in the locker room. Take a left. It's the fourth door on the right. -Thanks. -Don't mention it. -Bye. -Goodbye. -Hi, excuse me. -Good afternoon. -Lenka, can we talk? -Yeah, sure. I'll catch you later. -Whose idea was it? -What? Whose idea was it? -What? -You know what. Yours? -His. -Are you sure? So you just left him there? Yes. He wasn't moving and… Somebody opened a door, I got scared and ran away. When I came back, he was already moving and there was an ambulance there. What if nobody had found him there? Have you told anyone? Your parents? Friends? Somebody else? -No. -You sure? Now tell me what to do. You like him, don't you? He likes you too. Do you want him to stay in the Czech Republic? Then you must tell no one. -No one. -No one. Otherwise all three of us will go to jail, and then he'll be sent back to Ukraine. Lenka, please. Don't tell anyone, alright? Alright. -Go find your friends. -Thank you, goodbye. Goodbye. It's everywhere, Igor. On the internet, in the papers… We won't be able to get citizenship. We'll have to move away. -Where? -To Ukraine. I had a chat with Lenka. She'll keep her mouth shut. If you don't tell them who beat you up, they won't arrest anyone. They won't have a choice. Mind what you say and who you say it to. Why did you tell the reporter that I'd have to quit gymnastics? It would be dangerous with just one kidney. What? Why didn't you tell me? Mom. -I didn't want to upset you. -So you told everyone on TV instead? I didn't even know what I was saying. I'm sorry. I'll talk to your coach. We'll work it out, find something you enjoy as much as gymnastics, okay? I promise. What matters now… is that we don't give yourselves away. We have to convince everyone that you're telling the truth. She's here. Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. -This is Mrs. Zyrchenko. -Hello, I'm Zuzana Jandová, the mayor. -Good afternoon. Nice to meet you. First, I want to say I sincerely admire you. If something like this happened to one of my kids, I'd have a total breakdown. I'm sorry to drop in on you, but as soon as I learned what had happened, I contacted the investigator and gave him my full cooperation. The police have CCTV footage from your neighbourhood. We've also increased patrols around your apartment block. You know, the last thing I want is to have more cases like this. And I'm not just talking about the Romani. Mrs. Zyrchenko, Captain Novotný informs me the march isn't just attracting decent citizens, but also various other groups. -What groups? -Neo-Nazis. As a mother, I understand you're angry with the people who hurt your son. But I still want to ask you: Think twice before you go to the march. If you do go, please mind what you say. We're a small town. We don't have the security force of the big cities. Maybe that's the reason Igor was attacked. Mrs. Zyrchenko, what happened is a tragedy. But a conflict between extremists and the Romani is not going to help anyone. I'm sure everything will be sorted out and the kids will be caught. I don't know if I'm going to the march yet. The organizer, Mr. Selský, told me you were. No. Listen, I don't want to push you, but I think it'll be better if you don't go. I'd like to at least say hello to Igor. It'll only be a minute. Thank you. Get well soon and be good to your mom. Thank you. And one more thing. We're building new public housing. We have a good rapport with the developer, and given what's happened, I've been thinking you might like to move. It's a nice place, and Town Hall could help you with the rent. Of course, you don't have to decide right away. Here's my number. If you need anything, call me. Thanks a lot. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Bye. Your mom tells me you've remembered something. They threw me over the railing. Tell him everything. I'd heard some noise in the corridor. I thought someone was trying to break into the cellars again. I looked through the peephole, but I didn't see anyone. I went out into the corridor, went down the stairs, and suddenly, they pulled me down and started pounding me. The next thing I remember is that they threw me over the railing. I'm going to show you a couple of photos. Tell me if you recognise anyone, okay? -It wasn't this one. -I need to hear it from your son. -I've spoken to his mother. -Mrs. Zyrchenko. So, do you know them? Yes. All of them? Of course he does. They live in our block. If you keep interfering with the interrogation, I'm going to have to ask you to leave me and Igor alone. Was it one of them? No. Is there anything else you've remembered? No. Okay, then. I'll let you know if I need anything. And if you remember anything else, you have my number. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. You did well. You made it. Hello? Hello! It obediently soars high into the clouds and circles there until it rouses the game. Well, that's the end of the dictation. You have 20 minutes for the rest of the exam. I said no cell phones. -I was just checking the time. -I'm sorry, but you know the rules. He really was just checking the time. You'll be receiving your rejection letter by mail. Excuse me. We've talked to the cops. Igor told them it wasn't your son. Zyrchenko speaking. Sure, thanks a lot. Goodbye. You'll like it a lot, you'll see. Just a heads up: There'll probably be a few photographers there, so don't get scared. The developer insisted. -They're just gonna take a few pictures. -Sure. This is way out of character for me, but there's something I wanted to ask. I'm applying for citizenship. Last time I did, I was denied on a technicality. I'm worried it might happen again, so… I wanted to ask if you could write something up that I could attach to my application. You mean like a reference? Of course, not a problem. -Thank you so much. -Don't mention it. The view isn't much, but having a balcony is nice, especially in the summer. The flooring is wood-plastic composite. You can tear this wall down and get more living space. And this could be your son's room. I think he'd like it here. And the best for last. Our company, Kronstav, together with Town Hall, has decided to give you this check for 50,000 Czech crowns. 50,000 CZK VOUCHER Please accept it as a gift. Madam Mayor. Please. Hi. I just wanted to thank you again for everything you've done for Igor. Not at all. No, I can't accept this. -You must. -Mrs. Zyrchenko… I'm not leaving otherwise. Please. -Well, then, thank you. -Hi. The nurses will be happy. Say hi to Igor. I'll come check on him tomorrow. -Thanks a lot, goodbye. -Goodbye. -What's she doing here? -She's brought me notebooks. -Go home! Now! -Mom. -Now! -She's just brought me notebooks. Igor, have you lost your mind? Lenka. You mustn't come here. Until this is over, I don't want you seeing each other, texting, none of that. Understood? Don't tell anyone you were here. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Mom, she just brought me notebooks. -I'm out there lying for you, while the two of you are here, chatting? Have you lost your mind? -What are you doing? -Where is the charger? But, Mom… I don't have anyone but her. What about all those friends that came to see you? -They didn't come to see me. -Then why? -They came to get a photo for Insta. -Please stop it. I had invited everyone over, but she was the only one who came. I get that you like her, but right now you have to be patient. Understand? Greetings to everyone who's coming to our protest against violence on Friday. I'm delighted that so many people have signed up. There's around 2,500 of you already, and the number is growing by the minute. I just wanted to show you the preparations for Friday. The stage has just arrived. So, I believe we'll have everything ready by Friday. Also, I was just informed that, besides the mayor and other people, Igor's mom will also be speaking at the protest. She'll make time for us despite going through very difficult times. I really appreciate it. So, I hope to see you all here on Friday. After that, we'll go to the place where Igor was attacked. I look forward to meeting you all. Let's be strong together. Have a nice day. -Irina, come with me, please. -Just a sec. I'd find a way to talk to her, but next week she'd tell me she didn't understand. Boys, come have lunch. Good afternoon. -Hello. -Hello. Please tell her that if she wants to live here with two kids, she needs to pay extra for a cot. If you want to live here with two kids, you have to pay extra for a cot. -A cot? -An extra bed. We don't need an extra bed. My son sleeps here, and my daughter and I are sharing this bed. She says that her son sleeps here and she's sharing a bed with her daughter. -They don't need an extra bed. -But that's not how it works around here. If she doesn't respect the rules, she'll have to move out. -You need to respect the rules. -Where am I gonna put an extra bed? Tell her to cook in the kitchen, otherwise she stinks up the whole room. -I'll tell her. -Okay, thanks, Irina. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Do you know where the kitchen is? -Yes. You better cook there. Otherwise she gets nervous. -What? -What if somebody steals it? That's fine, but those people can't… -I'll do it tomorrow. -Today! Marta. Give her the cot and take it out of my paycheck. -Irina, come on. -Please do it. You know she has the money, she's just fucking with us. It's my money. Give her the cot. As you wish. -Okay. -Thanks. -Hello. -Hi, thanks for coming. Sorry I couldn't make it sooner. I'm swamped with the preparations. Michal, I feel you misunderstood. What do you mean? I never said I was coming to the march. I've talked to the mayor. She said the event wasn't just attracting normal people. What other kind of people is it attracting? -Abnormal? -Neo-Nazis. You think I'm a neo-Nazi? -Not you. -Then who? My friends? Their children? Are they the neo-Nazis? -No. -No. They're just people who've had enough. The mayor has done absolutely nothing in her three years in office. Now she's worried about losing votes, so she brings up neo-Nazis. -Are you ready to order? -I'll be leaving. Listen, I'm not gonna force you to come. But sleep on it. -Michal, listen… -You listen to me. Sleep on it. Make up your mind and let me know, okay? Sorry, I have to take this. Yes? From school. Texts only. Got it? And you'll delete them. -Anything else? -No, Mom. Thanks. Good afternoon. Your boss told me I'd find you here. Did you really tell the cops it wasn't him? -I did, and so did Igor. -They still haven't let Marek go. I'm sure they'll let him go soon. They also beat up my other son at school. He's been home for two days. Is he okay? Yeah, he is. I have a favour to ask. Tell the people at the demo that it wasn't my son. -As for the water leak… -Don't worry about it. -Okay. Grab your jacket, let's go. -Are you going home? -I'll give you a lift. -The bus stop is just around the corner. -The drive home is five minutes. -Let's go, I'll put it on for you outside. Let's go. Please take a seat. -I'm listening. -Why haven't you released our neighbour? You know what's strange, Mrs. Zyrchenko? Your son can't ID anyone, can't even describe what they looked like, but he's sure this particular kid had nothing to do with it. -How do you explain that? -Igor knows him. Why would that boy attack him? -That's exactly what I think. -Then why don't you let him go? Because he has a rap sheet, his DNA was found at the crime scene, he has no alibi, and the prosecutor has his own ideas. -Have a good day, bye. -Bye. We've checked all the CCTV footage. And we found nothing. The siblings of the boy we arrested told us they'd heard music coming from your apartment that night. Since when is it illegal to listen to music? They also told us another thing. That they'd heard Igor talking to someone. -He was probably on the phone. -They heard two voices. We have an agreement. If he wants to call someone from home, he does it over the internet, so we don't rack up a phone bill. We've had an expert report drawn up, which says that Igor's injuries aren't consistent with assault but with a fall. -They threw him over the handrail. -He did say that. But he also said they'd beaten him up. Can this expert really determine the cause of every bruise? Mrs. Zyrchenko, if there's something you want to say, now's the time. You don't have to wait for Igor to say it. Your neighbours'' boy will stay in custody until the trial, and if neither Igor nor you remember anything, it's possible he'll stay there much longer. Because no one's gonna confirm his alibi. I have nothing to say. Can I go now? Goodbye. -Hi. -Hi. Check it out. You like it? And the chair! You like it? Sit down, give it a try. It's second-hand, but it's in very good condition. Good? We can use your money to buy dryers, combs, cosmetics, and slowly get to work. I'll pay you back in instalments, okay? -Sveta. -Yes? I think I'm gonna give the money back. I'm sorry. The march to the house of the victim, Igor Zyrchenko, was eventually cancelled by Town Hall for fear of clashes with Romani activists. Dozens of police officers are on standby. Tomáš Vzorek has the details. Tomáš, how many people have gathered in the square? Good afternoon… Law enforcement and our nation's Interior Ministry have assured us that our town has absolutely no issues with safety. Let us not make our streets a battleground, and let us not promote conflicts that have no place in the 21st century. -Here you go. -Thank you. You can take the bottle to the stage with you. We'll get going once the mayor is done. We'll make it just in time. When you're near the stage, I'll notify Michal. He'll introduce you and cue you in, okay? …lies and speculations, but to point out the actual problems… -Karel has fixed the equipment. -Yeah, thank you. …and I can promise you that in my position I will do… Don't worry, they're not gonna whistle at you like that. …to make you all feel safe in our town. Thank you. I think it's time. I would like to thank Mayor Jandová for her speech. I'm certain that none of us wants to spread lies or misinformation. We are here to express our frustration with the inaction of the authorities. The law is not on the side of the victims… Michal has prepared an introduction, so don't be surprised. We will not be silent. If the situation doesn't change, we will meet here again. The honest citizens of this town must know that the law is on their side and that anyone who breaks the law will be punished regardless of skin colour. Wait here. Now please let me welcome to the stage a woman who has endured much suffering because of the dysfunctional system and police inaction. The mother of the assaulted boy Igor, Mrs. Irina Zyrchenko. Thank you for coming. IGOR, WE ARE WITH YOU Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Thank you for coming here. For Igor. For Igor! You've gathered here because you want to live in a safe town. That's right! The police have arrested a boy, our neighbour. Igor and that boy know each other. I know his mother, they live upstairs from us. That boy didn't do it. That boy is innocent. They know, but they're keeping him in custody nevertheless. That's why I'd like to ask the police to release the boy. Thank you all for helping us. On behalf of Igor and myself. We've also decided to donate 50,000 Czech crowns to Town Hall. Good! That's great! For the renovation of the rec centre. Once again, thank you for coming. Thank you. We thank you for your courage. Why didn't you tell me that? What Mrs. Zyrchenko has just said means that the police have arrested a completely innocent boy and are keeping him in custody. So… the three Romani criminals who did it are still roaming the streets unpunished. And the police are doing nothing! As a cover-up, they've arrested innocent people, innocent children. And if it weren't for Mrs. Zyrchenko, who has gathered the courage to tell us the truth, unlike the police, they would have succeeded. And that's why we will not stop! That's why I don't believe the mayor's promises. We ourselves must ensure that we feel safe in our town. Let's be strong together! FOR IGOR Thank you. Here you go. Take the bouquet. For Igor! …the final competition of the National Championship of the Czech Republic in gymnastics. A lot of legendary gymnasts came to see the best of the best, several Olympic participants, including the gold medallist… -When the dust settles, we'll confess. -…from the 1948 London Games… Are you kidding? Věra Růžičková… Martin Konečný was the big favourite… We'll go to the policeman and explain everything. He'll understand. -Then they'll finally leave us in peace. -Now, after everything that's happened? Okay. …the first three sets were amazing… You have any better suggestions? The cornerstone of the Czech national team… -Well? -We'll stick with it. -And lie for the rest of our lives? -You didn't mind lying before. -I did. -It didn't seem like it. People are gonna stop you in the street, ask you about it. -What if you say too much? -If we confess, it'll be even worse. -We'll move to another city. -Which city? -Which city, Mom? -I don't know. I'm not going anywhere. You hear me? If you tell anyone, I'll say you forced me to lie. Okay. Mom. If you do it, I'll never forgive you. Never. Altynai Kubatbek. -Congratulations! -Thank you. Artis Ziedonys. -Congratulations! -Thanks. Irina Zyrchenko. -Congratulations! -Thank you. We'll play the record shortly. Rise for the national anthem of the Czech Republic. Where is my home? Where is my home? Over leas are waters streaming On the hills, blue forests dreaming Flowery wolds, spring's happy skies Like an earthly paradise There's the land so full of beauty Czechia My fatherland! Czechia My fatherland!
