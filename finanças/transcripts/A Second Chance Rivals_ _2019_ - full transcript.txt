Maddy! Surprised Dad didn't call you as soon as he noticed his precious Charger was missing. It's lovely to see you. - Come on. - Oh, my gosh. What happened? Dad's just hassling me about what to do now. Just the usual. I just really needed a break. Well, why don't you stay here for a while, and we'll have some chats and we'll work it out? Did you bring any clothes with you? A couple. I was sort of hoping you'd say stay. Well, go get your clothes. The spare room is already made up for you. And, Maddy, call your dad. He is worried about you. Just a few things, hey? Are you expecting someone else? Tess is coming to stay next week for three months while Kate and Shane are heading off. I know that was the dream. I just worked so hard for it. Come on, get your stuff put away. I mean, I know you're on a, what shall I say, a sabbatical, but I've... we've got gymnasts to train. Hey, Charger. What was that about? It's a '70s thing. You had to be there. So, they finished the new sports center? Yup, years of lobbying councils and MPs has all paid off. - Hey, Tess. - Alkira, hey. - Handstand challenge? - Er, now? Okay, coming, okay. I'll be there in a sec. Tess, where are you going? You still have homework to do, I told you not to go out! Hey, I'm practicing this time, and I'm gonna smash. Shane... - Hmm? - And what's that? A chill pill. Funny. I am so going to beat you this time. I've been practicing, and I'm actually getting really good. I can last for, like, ages. Dream on. I always beat you. I'm so fat. - Thanks. How are you? - I'm good. Maddy! Okay, girls, Maddy is going to be here for a few weeks, so you can chat to her and do your selfies later. Let's get started on the floor for some warm-up. Thank you. You girls better go warm up. - Yeah. - I'll come see you after, yeah? Er, Maddy. Er, can you supervise and coach the elite competition girls? I'm not really a coach, I don't... Oh, please. Okay, sure. Show me what you got, girls. Let's go. Bars. - Bars, bars, bars. - Okay! More in. Alright? Straighten the arms... Girls, that was so good. I'm really impressed. - What apparatus now? - Beam next. Actually, we might go to floor first. Good. Alright, that's it. And really you have to stretch your leg up. Good. Great, excellent. Beautiful! Yeah, that's really great. Okay, girls, break time. Grab your snacks and take a rest. - Where's yours? - Not hungry. You're crazy. I'm starving. Want some of mine? Go on. Right-o, girls, break time's over. Let's get back on the floor. Handstand competition time. Now you know the rules. Handstand walk is okay, but Alkira and Tayla need to be stationary. Alkira is our current champion, and she has the call. Can Maddy do it, too? Your ankle is still recovering, but your back is okay, isn't it? Oh, a handstand won't hurt. You can do it! - Yes, do it! - Can I walk in handstand? No way! Alright. Okay, everyone, ready? One, two, three. Yeah, Alkira, come on, you've got it! Come on, come on! Very good, Maddy. Very good. And great, girls. You girls are fantastic. You really are the best, Maddy. Great coaching, too. Aw, thanks, girls. She's so good! Typical. Alkira is so impressive. Like, she just about had me... Yeah. - Oh, she's so determined. - Yeah. But she needs a lot of strength and conditioning. Reminds me a lot of you when you were that age. Say, since you're staying for a while, why don't you coach them for the next competition? They'd love it. Give you something to do, take your mind off. - Hello! - Hi! Hello! Hi. Come on. I think that's an awesome idea, Beverly. What? What'd I miss? Please, please, please, Maddy, coach us for the next comp. Please! Okay. Alright. I mean, you guys are away, I'm here anyway. I'll be... Alkira. Hey. Oh, yeah, just arrived. Tess, manners. Now? Er, yeah. Should be good. I've got super-exciting news, too. Erm, Maddy, Alkira wants to show you a special spot. I can show you the way. Tess, how about you ask us for permission first? Mother, really? Go. - Let's go. - Where are we going? It's a special spot, just first, let's take a selfie. Thanks. Okay, can we just do, like, another one? So, like, just turn around and then put your arms up and do sort of like a pose. Yeah. Cool. Sweet. Thanks. Kylie, of course. Tess is so difficult. All she does is her gymnastics and watch old movies. Seems to hate me with a passion. Me, her mother. The only way I can communicate with her these days is to text her. I seem to remember around the same age, you were fighting with your mother. Really? Was I? Don't worry, it's just a girl thing around 11 and 12. It'll pass. She's totally fine with me. That's because I'm left to do all the disciplining. No wonder she is fine with you. Handstand challenge? You ready? Maddy? No, thank you. Alkira almost got me the other day, so I'm gonna quit while I can. Thank you, girls. Keep it going, girls. Still up! Hey, she's cheating. That's unfair. You cheated! - Good. - You were amazing, girl. Competition tomorrow, girls. Who's excited? Me. My first comp as a coach, this'll be interesting. Don't worry, we'll look after you, newbie. What is the competition like? Tough. - We can do this. - We've got... - We've got a new coach. - We gonna smash. Maddy? Becky? Oh, my God! I haven't seen you since you and Chelsea left for World Juniors. - What are you doing here? - Coaching. Would you believe? Girls elite stream at North Flinders. Well, we'll be up against each other then. I'm coaching the Aerial girls. My city girls always smash country girls. Well, good luck with that. You know what they say, those who can, do, and those who can't, teach. Did Becky just try to insult Maddy, but insulted herself at the same time? Don't worry. And pity about missing out on the Olympics. You must be devo. Come on, girls. Some things never change. Gymnasts, please line up for the presentation. Oh, my God! Yes! - They're so full of themselves. - Yeah. Come on, girls, they're not worth it. Come on, girls, cut it. Congrats on the win, I can definitely see what you were saying about city beating country. Thanks. My city girls are just better. No, it was pretty close, actually. The judges certainly seemed to favor your girls. No, they don't. My girls are better trained and coached. I've been coaching for years. And everybody can see your girls are just going over the top in the skills they're attempting. How is the ankle? It's been this way for years! The same as when I was competing, completely biased against country kids. And as for Alkira's score, look, it's disgusting! It's racism, just like when I was little! You'd think things would have changed by now. Look, I can't say how things were when you were competing, but I can assure you that every judge here just watches the performance and scores accordingly, regardless of race, nationality or what location they come from. You know, she's sort of right. Show me where... Well, I'm gonna show you the scores. Maddy Cornell, isn't it? Hi, I'm Jason McCloud. First time coaching, I hear. - Yeah. - Your team did great. You're lucky Beverly trains them so well. No, I actually trained them. Oh, no, no, no, that's awkward, I didn't mean to say that you couldn't coach or that they're not good... You know, I'm gonna stop before I dig a bigger hole for myself. I think that's a good idea. My daughter deserves better than this and you know it. But there's something I want to say... Do you wanna maybe go see a movie or go to dinner, or something, with me? - Sure. - Really? Great. Cool. When? Sorry, what? When do you wanna go out with me? - No. - What? I'm sorry, you said... You said yes. I meant thanks for asking, but maybe another time? What did you mean that she's sort of right? Well, if you go out with me, then I'll tell you. You know, a man bun would look good. Hey, girls, girls, girls. Do you have, like, a hair tie or something? Er, nah. As if I'd give him a hair tie. Crash and burn, huh, Mav? Dr. Matheson, is everything okay? Beverly just likes me to keep a close eye on her. Thanks, Bruce. Thanks. - How did it go? - Good. Finished just out of placings. Did you not know that Becky's coaching the Aerial girls? It was like being back at primary school again. Honestly, she is so competitive. And she just has it in for, like, me and all the country girls, that's for sure. I cannot wait until the next comp. My girls are gonna smash her city girls. So, you like coaching, then? Much rather be competing, but... listening to Becky, I'd seriously like to stick it to her. Anything else happened? Yeah, actually, this judge, Jason, introduced himself to me. He's cute, isn't he? Well... Yeah, he's cute. Did he, erm, say anything? He actually asked me out. I said yes. - Great! - Then I said no. I wasn't really paying attention when I said yes. Then, you know, I was listening to Sally and Mary argue about the judging. and then Jason came over and he said Mary had a point, and then he just became, like, really evasive about what he was trying to say, and then he was going on about going out and, you know... So you're not going out with him? - Yes. - I mean, no. No, I'm not. Wait, what do you--? What did you mean, did he ask anything? Beverly? That's fantastic! I'm so proud! That's a great result for North Flinders! Clearly, you should keep coaching them. No, it's Beverly's team. I was just happy to help out. But, Maddy, please keep coaching. We all love having you. It's awesome! Can't get a better endorsement than that, Maddy. I'm not sure. I just don't know what I want to do. Hi, Bev. I was just speaking to Tayla's father, and he will pay you to coach the team till the last State Championship competition. You get to do what you love, gymnastics. It's just coaching, and you'll get paid. And that will get your dad off your back. Plus, you get to take on Becky and beat her. Wow, that's awesome, Beverly, and a perfect fit for you, too, Maddy. Please, please, please? Okay. Only till the last championship round, though. How's it going over there? It's intense. Shane and I are doing training and teaching sessions with elite gymnasts every few days in a new city. It's awesome, though. Tess, are you doing your homework? Yes, Mum, I'm doing my homework. You have a tendency to leave it to the last minute. Well, I have been really busy this week. I don't want you to stay up until 1:00 a.m. desperately... I'm sorry. She's out. I'm not putting her through what I went through. I know you were treated badly. I saw it with my own eyes, but I am sure it has changed. You weren't at the comp. It's the same biased judging towards city kids, and quite frankly, racism towards Alkira. Mary, the team did really well and they're gonna do better next time. The judging was harsh, but we can prove them wrong. - See? Even Maddy sees it. - No! No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm trying to say that Alkira and Tess are the best gymnasts I've seen. The best gymnasts around here by far. Clearly, Maddy is out of her depth. Coaching, dealing with young gymnasts and biased judging. You better catch up with Tayla. Maddy is an ex-world champion gymnast... and a brilliant young coach. That may be. But it doesn't solve the judging issues, does it? I'm sorry. Let's go. I'm sorry. Hey, Maddy, check this out! Tess, that's dangerous! - Who taught you that? - No one. I copied them off the YouTube clips I've been learning from. They are so cool and way more advanced stuff - than what we're doing! - Right. I knew Beverly wouldn't be encouraging such reckless moves. I know you wanna do bigger stuff, but they need lots and lots of build-up work so they're safe. You are not to use YouTube for your training skills. It's dangerous! Mum, I want to go back to gym. Alkira, no. Mum, I just want to train and compete with my friends. No. We'll find something else for you to do. - Gabby, hi. - Hi, Maddy, how are you? I'm good. Thanks. Listen, I've just seen the most recent scans, and as you were advised, your back's completely healed. And your small tear in your Achilles is almost completely healed as well, so you're clear to start training again. I know missing out on the Olympics was a huge disappointment, for you but now we've got time, we can work on those big skills and get you ready for Worlds. I was thinking you could start next week. Might as well get you back on the horse as soon as possible. Maddy? Er... Erm... Sorry, when do you think? Next week. I'm not sure. I'll have to think about it. Thanks, Gabby. Gabby wants me back at training. What do you think? Are you ready? I don't know. My confidence... I just don't know. Just give it time. Looks like you need more treble in the first leap. Or maybe I'm just doing my footing wrong or something. I'll just try again. I thought I told you no back flips on the beam, and certainly no back flip dismounts, and to stop getting your training off YouTube! I'm not allowed to even be here. Catch you later, Tess. But, Maddy, you won't teach me, so I'll have to teach myself! Tess, you have to understand without the right preparation, this can go so terribly wrong, okay? Just trust me. Mum, I'm serious, I wanna go back to gym. Alkira, we've already spoken about this. No. No, we haven't. All you've said is no. Mum, what happened to you was horrible. I totally get that, but this is my life! It's what I love doing, and I'm really good at it. - But it's not fair. - Mum. I don't care. I love doing it. How does holding on to the past help anything? Do something good and be a part of the solution! Be a judge or something yourself. Wow. So, can I go back? No. I can't do that to you or to myself. Mum, it's not about you! It's for me! Tess, can you just train on your own for a bit, please? - Tays, are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, just feel a bit light-headed. Alright, come, sit down. Sit down for a second, here. Sit down. Have you eaten? Of course. Oh, what did you have? Cereal and a banana. Well, that's what I was going to have, but... Has anyone being bullying or hassling you? No. No one has said anything about your weight or the way you look or-- No. Why? Are you saying I'm fat? No. No, I'm just asking. Look, Tayla, I've been in gymnastics for years. I've seen it all. And I've seen these signs before. Eat! You're burning up heaps of energy, okay? You need it. - Ow! - Tess, don't do that again! Like I said before, you won't teach me, so I'll have to teach myself. No, even with the correct training and preparation, that can go horribly wrong! - But I know what I'm doing! - No, you don't! Yes, I do! You're not teaching me anything! Just be patient with me, okay? Just because you've lost your nerve and don't have the guts to do big skills anymore, doesn't mean others have. - Tess! Apologize at once! - Why? Because that's an appalling thing to say. No. Truth hurts. Maddy? Hi, this is Gabby. You've missed me. So leave a message. Gabby, hi, it's Maddy. Sorry I've missed you. I'm ready. I will be back at training next week. Alright, thanks. Dad! - Hello! - Hey, kiddo. What's wrong? Beverly's passed away. Are you serious? I'm afraid so. It was earlier this evening. I was just with her. Was it anything I did? Oh, no. No, no, no. No. I spoke to her doctor. She was worse than anyone knew. I feel so responsible! You know, me and Tess, we had a massive fight. Beverly was trying to call me. I know, I heard. - Tess is absolutely distraught. - Oh, no! She feels totally responsible. Poor Tess. It's just too much, Dad. Beverly... I can't believe it. Tess hates me, Alkira quit, Tayla hates me. I told Gabby I was gonna go back to training for Worlds, but... I know I'm not ready, and now Beverly... It's just too much, I just... - Thank you so much. - Welcome. It was so beautiful. She would have loved it. Thank you. Maddy, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean... I didn't mean anything I said. What I said to you was horrible and... - It's all my fault. - Hey. No. No, Tess, I feel horrible, too. I left without speaking to her and I didn't take her calls, which I will forever regret. But no matter what, neither of us are responsible, okay? She was really, really sick. - And she didn't tell anyone. - Yeah. And, Mum, I've been so horrible to you, too, and... I'm going to do better. Promise. Tess, honey. Honey. We can all do better. You know, Tess, you were right. I have lost my edge. And it, it just hurts so much to hear it from someone so much younger and braver than me. But I want us to finish this for Beverly. I want us to stay and train together and win the championship for her. But I thought you were going back to training for the Worlds. Maybe after all this is done. But this is all that's important to me right now. Alright? We're taking this for Beverly. Come here. Mary, I need Alkira on the team. We can't win it without her. And it's what Beverly would have wanted. Mary, it gives me a second chance too. That's good reverse, Tayla. Good. Tayla! Come on, Tess. So, gals, I think the best approach is to keep a low profile at the next comp and to sneak up on the Aerial girls for the championship. Sounds like a plan. Deadly. No, no, aim for three, and then we can get there. Maddy, I'm so sorry about Beverly. She was, and always will be an inspiration to gymnasts and coaches. Thanks. I owe her heaps. Hey, just so you know, we're coming for you guys. We're here to win. Is that right? Well, bring it on. What happened to keeping a low profile and then jump them for the championship? Yeah, but then I thought, "Nah, let's just put it on them and see if they crack." Felt good. - Maddy is back and she's bad. - Yeah. Hey, Maddy. I'm so sorry to hear about Beverly. I... Listen, if you need someone to, like, talk to or something, then I'm... I'm here. I've known Beverly since I was a kid. So I'm pretty devo, too. Thanks. I really appreciate it. Maybe another time or something? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Any time. He's so sweet. It'd be nice if you went out with him. I mean, I'm sure it's what Beverly would have wanted, anyway, so... What'd you say to her? I think we need to make a date card and a rose ceremony she can't refuse. - What? - What? Come on, guys. Crash and burn, huh, Mav? Again? Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me? De Niro. Nice. Maverick, Charlie? Well, I mean, it seems appropriate. Well... I'll be back. Arnie. Beverly liked you, you know? We all like you. Thanks... I think. The girls and I reckon we can get you over the line. Want our help? Maybe. What did you have in mind? Send me an e-mail and I'll send you a link to a song. A song? Yeah, I've got a plan. I don't know... Don't worry, I won't stalk you or anything. It's a good plan. And Maddy will love it. Well, I do love it when a plan comes together. The A-Team. Hannibal? - We're so close to winning. - Yeah. I just need to do something big for extra points. Yeah. Got your phone, Tays? No, Maddy's not watching. Ah, don't worry about it. Quickly. Okay. A top choice. Here we come for the gold, Kylie! - Yeah. - Come on. Yes. Tess, what was that? We were so close to winning and I needed to go big to get some extra points. That completes today's event and presentations. Nice work, North Flinders. The championship is cumulative scores from each event. So just one to go. Good luck catching up. Keep up those big routines, and you never know... Did you just--? Never mind. I don't get it. How's that? All my girls did bigger routines with maximum start value for that level. Half of Becky's team, they left off the more difficult skills, yet somehow they out-scored us. What is with the bias towards Becky and the city girls? There's absolutely no bias between city and country girls. Well, the scores are saying very differently. Well, you are completely wrong. We just judge the performance that is given. You know what, I actually think Alkira's mum is right. There is some serious bias, guys, especially towards Alkira! That's complete rubbish! It couldn't be further from the truth. No, that is wrong! Her mum's been-- Well, actually... I do judge the North Flinders girls slightly harder... than the... Well, I mean, I judge fairly. Of course, I judge fairly. Maddy, your three girls, they have way more talent than most of the gymnasts here, but they have the least technical refined skills. I'm sorry, but it's frustrating to see that talent wasted, right? That is just one isolated judge's opinion. Well, okay. Okay. Who else here judges the North Flinders girls harder because they are so talented? Come on. Come on. Well, I mean, Jason is sort of right, not that he explains it all that well. It's not that we are biased, it's just that the other girls have refined their skills. I mean, North Flinders are doing bigger skills, absolutely, but they don't have the work ethic to perfect or refine them. I mean, your girls are attempting skills they're not really ready ready for. I mean, your girls are attempting skills they're not really ready ready for. Maddy, I just think we should go for broke. Push the limits, smash out the big routines. I don't know, it seems high risk. High risk, big reward. It's what you've always done, the big skills, and you pull 'em off. This is ultimate for me. I just feel like I need more preparation. Trust me, I want this as bad as you. We need to go big. You can refine the skills later after qualifying. They're attempting skills they're not really ready for. I mean, put simply, your girls just don't work hard enough. We are only 0.8 behind Becky's team for the championship. Okay, wait for it. The judges admitted that they were biased towards the city teams. - I knew it. - That's so unfair! Yeah, but wait, let me explain. You work and train the least. Tess, you think because you have well-known gymnastic parents that you're judged harshly. - Yes! - You're not! You're just not working hard enough to perfect the skills. You think you're owed something because you're trying these big moves. And, Tayla, you're very similar. And you work hard, but you're focusing on other things. And, Alkira, you are probably the most talented gymnast here, all right? Your flexibility is amazing! And your determination is second to none, but... And, Mary, this is why I brought you in. It's not racism. All right? It might well have been in your day, but the thing is it's not. How do you know that? Mary, I sat down with the judges. We went through every single score sheet, our girls and Becky's girls. And it's all the same thing. Tiny deductions for sloppy little skills. - Do we wanna beat Becky's team? - Absolutely yes. All right, well, Becky's team, they're training seven times a week. What are we training? Three. If we wanna win this championship in six weeks, our strength and fitness, girls, it's not good enough. We're gonna start this off by doing seven sessions a week and a boot camp. I might get someone in to help us with that. And, Tess, I'm gonna make a deal with you, okay? You find me any gym action from YouTube, anything that we have the skills for and that we can safely incorporate into the routines, we will, all right? Okay. Are you girls in? We're in. You don't beat me on the way in... Guys, look, it's Sally Pearson! - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! That is so cool. Girls, this is my good friend, Sally. Hi. She's the most motivating and inspiring athlete I know. So who better to get us started, right? Yeah. Well, Maddy's asked me here to help out because I know what it takes to win gold. Could I please take a quick selfie with you? - Sure. - Thank you. Ah, you girls. You are so cut! - Yeah. Ripped. - Can I? Well, we have two days to set you girls on the right path. Are you ready? Didn't this used to be an old army training ground? Yup. It looks really hard. Yup. We can do it. Maximum effort. Oh, that's really cool. I like it. Deadly. All right. You ready? - Yeah! - Let's go. Let's go. Come on, come on, come on, girls. Beautiful. Faster, faster! Come on! Come on, come on, go faster, faster... Great work, girls. That's it for today. Let's eat and get some sleep. Oh, no, I don't think so. What? We're gonna sleep out here? Absolutely. - No, thanks. - Seriously? Yeah. Why do you guys get to sleep in the comfort? Well, that's easy. I've done the work. I'm not the one training for State Championships in six weeks' time, you are! You have to toughen up to be worthy of gold. Come on, guys. Have fun! We're probably gonna die! We'll get eaten alive by mosquitoes. - And freeze to death. - Goodnight. Oh, I'm so sore. So many stars. I wonder where they came from. Well, stars are created from nuclear fusion. The outflow of energy provides the pressure to keep the star from collapsing under its own weight. I reckon the sun lights our way in the day and the moon at night. One night the moon was being stolen, so five of the bravest warriors went to the highest mountain and jumped into the sky to protect it. Whenever a warrior passes, their spirit leaps into the night sky to become a star to protect the moon. Wow, I like your explanation a lot better than science class. Good job! Well done! Come on, keep going! Faster, faster, faster! Right, girls, keep it going! Come on! - You need to out-train. - You're doing really well. Well done! Let's go! They are improving so much. Yeah, they're doing really well. This is torture! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. It was fun! She's gonna love it! - What do you think? - It's awesome. Deadly. - Yeah. - So good! You girls aren't watching YouTube and doing routines from there, are you? Because we had an agreement about that. - No, no, absolutely not. - No. No. Oh, my God, guys! Good job, gals. Who's heading? - Me. - Excellent. Hey, girls, I need your help with something. Good job, Alkira! That was amazing! Tess. We wanna rotate this... Come on, Tayla. Yes, nice. Good. Keep it strong, keep it strong. Good. - Okay. - All good. It's all good. Good job. Just go, go do it again. Give it another go, all right? - What's wrong? - Nothing. Tayla has improved so much. I feel like the more confidence she has, the better she does. But I just feel like... something's holding her back. What was it called? Ah, yes. Sweetheart, have a good day. - See ya. - Enjoy training. - Hey, Tay. - Hi, Alkira. I was looking at the gym chat site last night. Those Aerial girls, Kylie and Cassie, are complete tools. You know you are absolutely awesome, right? They're just stuck-up, brain-dead city trolls. You are already a super-fit muscle pot. I want you to help me get into that shape. Yeah, but when I look in the mirror, I think I'm dumpy and ugly just as they say. Hey, see this? This don't wash off, you know? I've seen the crap comments all my life. I'm not letting anyone put me down. I'm just gonna show 'em. Just quit the site and the chats. They'll stop if they aren't getting to you. You are awesome. Let's show 'em and whip their butts. Yeah. We're deadly. Yeah. Yeah, let's show 'em. Come in. Let's go. You know, you can just use deadly. Doesn't need anything else. Yeah? Deadly. Nice. Come on, Tayla, that's it! - Tayla, you are amazing! - Amazing. Smashing it out! Seriously, bring on Becky and her team! Yes! - Maximum effort. - Come on. So you girls definitely don't know where Mary and Alkira are? No, I just tried to ring again, but it just rings out. I'll try. Gymnasts, please complete your warm-up. Guys, what do we do now? We're starting. Stand out of the introduction. We'll join in when she gets here for the first apparatus. C'mon. All right, just stand here. We'll just watch and warm-up here. Gymnasts, please line up for the presentation. Has Mary withdrawn Alkira? Well, I mean, it'd be nice if she told us, cos there goes the championship. I don't know. I hope not. Teams competing today are Queenstown, Dynamic, Woodlands... Aerial, North Flinders. North Flinders. - What's going on? - No idea. They'd better at least just start up on the first apparatus, otherwise they'll be disqualified. Gymnasts, to your first apparatus. - Look, there they are. - Oh, yes. But, wait, Alkira's not with them. So none of you girls spoke to her? No, I tried calling her before, but she just didn't pick up. What are we gonna do? Well, our best, and Alkira will do the same when she gets here. Ready? Maximum effort. Let's go. No answer. Thanks! It's Mary who called. Yes. It's alright. Love to know what's going on. Wait, where's Kate gone? I'd definitely want to know what's going on now. Wait. Kate? Where are you? What, you left? Why? Okay. Yup. Yup. Yeah, got it. Okay, okay, okay. Yup. Pat and I are on to it. What's happening? Kate wants us to look through the rule book to see if there are any bylaws about gymnasts and rotations. Who would have a competition rulebook in their handbag? A coach who doesn't like to lose and won't take no for an answer. Like mother, like daughter. Oh, Kate, you're a lifesaver. Finding a flat car, couldn't get a hold of anyone. What a day! Don't worry, we're on our way now. But Alkira's already missed half the competition. We might be okay. Pat and Shane are looking into it. Alkira, get warmed up. - There they are. Go, go. - She's here! She's here! Oh, hey. Hey. Don't worry. We've got this, all right? - Did you find anything? - Not a thing. - All right, let's go. - Oh, yeah. Hey, Sally, okay, so Alkira's here now, so she can compete. No, she can't. She's late. She's missed out. But it doesn't say anywhere where she can't. Just compete now, the comp's still going. - That's not how we do things. - You can't do that. It's not in the rules. If she completes each apparatus before the comp finishes, she has to be allowed to compete. Have a look. Look, competing per rotation with your team is just an accepted practice. It's not what the rules say. Okay. But you'll need to be finished all her apparatus by the last gymnast in the last rotation. This will conclude the competition, and if she's not done by then... - Okay? - Yes. Thank you, Sally. Great news. Alkira, you can compete. What happened? Maximum effort. Come with me, Alkira. Come on. Well? It must be close. I think Alkira's floor might make or break it for them. - Yes! - Line up! Come on, Alkira. Maximum effort! Let's go! Well, any idea who's won? Congratulations, gymnasts and coaches, another great championship. This being the third and final round of the State Championship, thank you to the parents and friends for supporting and coming out today. In third place, Queenstown Gymnastics. The top two teams with accumulative scores over the three rounds are Aerial Gym Club and North Flinders Gym. What I can say is North Flinders have done an exceptional job in getting so close with a record-smashing set of performances in this final round. The winner of the State Championship by just 0.01 is... North Flinders Gymnastics. Of course, in second place, with brilliant results each round, Aerial Gymnastics. Australian Olympic gymnast, Larissa Miller will be presenting the medals. I'm also delighted to announce the State Championship cup will be named after someone who's contributed so much to junior gymnastics. Beverly Teague. And now would everyone be up standing, please, for the presentation of the inaugural Beverly Teague Memorial Cup. I would like to invite North Flinders coach and long-time close friend of Beverly, Maddy Cornell, to accept the cup for the State Championship. Thank you. I'd like to invite Kate Fuller-Jones to come and accept this with me. Thank you, everyone. That concludes tonight's events and presentations. Well done! Yes! Look at you, guys. - Maddy? - Oh, my God. Tess, Alkira, Tayla, congratulations. That was an amazing performance. I thought we had you covered, but your big routine and fine skills pipped us at the post. Congrats. Hey, that's so kind. We really appreciate it. Great competition, girls. It brings out the best. And I can't think of a more fitting finale than for you guys for the first-ever Beverly Teague Cup. We're coming to get it next year, though. All right. I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm so impressed with the Aerial girls and the coaching. I'd like my girls to come and train with you guys whenever possible. I feel like you girls could learn a lot from Cassie, Kylie and Li. - What do you think? - I'd be honoured. Maybe we can do an exchange. We could come down to the country to do some training, you guys can get with us and do some training. Yeah. Actually, I know just the spot to do some training. It'll be fun. We do need to address the gymnastic chat-group posts, though. There's some real cyber bullying. I'm sorry, I didn't know. Girls, there's nothing wrong with some serious rivalry, but don't cross the line. I'm sorry. It was too far. Me, too. I'm really sorry, guys. Group hug. I've been thinking and... I'd like for you both to train me for Worlds. Maddy, that would be a dream come true for us. But what about Gabby? I'm gonna decline. I wanna stay home for a bit, do some coaching, and be around coaches I know and can trust. I can't think of anyone better than you guys. - Mum! Dad! - There she is! Here she is, our little champion. See, all the hard work pays off, doesn't it? Yeah. Hello, Mary. How are you? Hello, well done. Congratulations. That is brilliant. Well done. Here you go, Mary. We'll see you in three weeks' time. Well done again. Judges? Really? I told you. Hey, Maddy, I have something special to show you. Something I picked up from YouTube. All he needs is just an opportunity He likes you a lot But you were just too blind to see He wanted to say it for so long He'd been giving you hints But you don't catch on We know you're sad Because you didn't make the team We know you're down Cos you didn't make your dream Girl, you could be happy Just stop and think He might even be romantic He's cute, we think you both suit He'll fit right into our crew All he needs is just an opportunity He likes you a lot But you were just too blind to see He's a real sweet guy And he's just so cool Every girl likes him in our school He's the guy And you two will fly fast Just don't let him burn and crash Cos we really like him, too So now you know what to do Don't let him walk the other way And please say yes to a date OK? All he needs is just an opportunity He likes you a lot But you were just too blind to see Go Movie or dinner? You are persistent. Movie and dinner? All right, come on, let's dance. Even you, Maddy. - What are you doing? - Dancing. Just follow me. So, what did you have in mind for training when we come up next? This is torture! I'm so sorry to hear about what happened to Kate. But the harsh reality is that there's only one spot available for Worlds. You two are gonna have to fight each other for it.
