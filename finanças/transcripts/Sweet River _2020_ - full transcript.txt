- Nigel! - Oh, mate, you sure you need another one? Oh, come on, Nige, I think I made it with 40 cents left in the kitty. You'll end up going home on a stretcher... Do you have any idea, Nigel, of the mental fortitude it takes to be this town's most eligible bachelor without a bloody job? So, yeah, hit me with that rum. Why don't you just get yourself a different job? Doing what, mate? Hey? Well... I've been in that mill since I was 15, and I finally make it to management and bam! See ya later. - Here you go. - That's on the house... No, no, no, mate, no, no! - Yeah. - I'm flush, Nige! I'm renting the old worker's cottage out to some English bird from the city. I tell ya, if she looks half as good as she sounds on the phone. Plus, I'm gonna... I'm gonna harvest the fields behind the cottage. - You're not serious. - Yeah, deadly. Can't afford to just leave 'em there anymore. Mate, I don't have a choice. Don't look at me like that, Nige. You win some, you lose some. Thanks for it. God. You are shitting me, come on. Oh, fuck. Come here. Come here, come here. Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck! Is there a torch? Hello? Oh, fuck. Oy! Who's there? We are really right to feel these things. We are highly intuitive beings, and we can feel subtle changes against the natural flow. So when feelings of despair and dread come up... The pain behind the fear, the unknown that cannot be seen will create fear. Step out from the darkness and shine a light to awaken your love. We're not wrong to feel loss, and pain of the heart. We must search and seek holding on to love. Pause for a moment. - Hello? - Hi. I'm Hanna Montague. I'm renting the, um... I spoke to Mr. Lipton about renting the worker's cottage. Cottage isn't up for rent. There was an ad, I called. I spoke to Mr. Lipton, I've just tried to call him, but I can't seem to get a hold of him. John! What's Lipton gone and done now? How would I bloody know? Yeah, I'm renting the worker's cottage from Mr. Lipton. I can't seem to get a hold of him. Let me handle this. Don't worry about her. Come on, I'll show you in. Thank you. Jimmy didn't tell us he put the cottage up for rent. We sold it to him a couple years back along with the fields. Still run the cane, though. Jimmy couldn't grow a weed in a rainforest. I hope your wife's okay with me being here. Oh, she'll get over it. We're just not getting many visitors around here. Mm. This'll be good for her. I passed the police on my way in. There seemed to be some sort of an accident. - Accident? - Yeah, just up the road. So, what is it you're doing here, Miss...? Hanna, please, call me Hanna. I'm John Drake, wife's Elenor. Nice to meet you, John. So you were... Just a change of scenery, clear my head, not much. Well, you came to the right place for "not much." - Do you need a hand? - No, I'm good. All right, well, if you need anything, - don't hesitate. - Thanks, John. Oh! Oh, I'll need that. Thank you. Oh, and don't worry about Ellie. She'll warm up to you. It's just that you left in a hurry. We're just all concerned and hope that you're doing the right thing. I know, Jules. Are you... are you keeping up with your diary? Haven't missed a beat. How could I with you on my ass? I'm not just your sponsor, I'm your friend as well. I want it to work out for you. I know, Jules, I get it, I do. I really hope you find what you're looking for, Hanna. I just want to give him a proper burial. I can't rest until that happens. Sorry, John. It's Jimmy. What happened? I found him facedown in the drainage ditch. He drowned. Drowned? Fell over while he was taking a piss. You're fucking kidding me. Sort that car out. Mate had been talking to contractors. He'd been organizing to have your field harvested. He must've been dying for that piss to hit the brakes that fucking hard. He accidentally fell in the ditch while he was taking a piss, and he drowned. That's what's going in my report, that's where we leave it, do you understand, John? - John? - Yeah. Yeah. I see you've got a visitor at your place. Yeah, some English woman's renting a cottage. Yeah, well, you know who she is. Mate. I'm not the fucking landlord. But all of this, this here, it has to stop. What about your missus? Is she ready to stop? See, that's what I fucking thought. Find yourself as you search for the light. Bring this into your soul and seek the peace, the more I shall release my grip. Know that me being here is my way of holding your memory... holding on to love, the less I will need to hold you so tight. Do not fear me, for I am here always with you and close to your chest. I am a strong and true and loyal friend to hold you in your life. Life is in your hands. Face me with courage. I am here to guide you, my love. It does not have to be so dark. Search with me and within yourself for the light which will bring you back without fear. My message for you, dear one, is of coming to peace and healing to become whole. Hanna! Hanna. In here, John. Hey. So that's why you're here. Another journo come to pick at the scabs. It's not what you think. I'm not a journalist. Then what are you? A mother. His name was Joey. I don't know what you're expecting to find here, but this town isn't one for opening up old wounds. The wound never healed, John. My son's body was never found. His case was left unsolved. There was a lot of talk about what went wrong here. There was a lot of blame. You think you can move on from something like that, but... I'm sorry for your loss. I feel for you. But some things are just... It was Jimmy Lipton. What was? The accident that you passed. Oh, God. That was him? Yeah. You're welcome to stay. At least till you get sorted out. Driven the fire right up the back of my daughter's place. - What, Jonno? - Yeah. You're fucking joking. What are you having, love? Just a soda water and lime, please. On the hard stuff, are ya? You must be that city girl, eh? Yeah. There we go. Here you go. Thanks. Ta. James Lipton. "Teabag" to his mates. Bloke who owned the cottage you're in. Got a couple of divorces under his belt, drank like a fucking fish. He did always want to go out pissed. But I'd have much rather seen him sitting there at that chair. So how is it? It's basic, but I don't need much. Keep doing your meditations, yeah? Yeah, no, I will, I will, I will. Hold on a sec, darling. - Hi, John. - Ellie and I were wondering if you want to come over for food tonight. You're not forcing this on her, are you? It was her idea. Okay, yeah, that'd be lovely, thanks! 6:30, hmm? Us oldies like to eat early. Oh, no, thanks. What, you don't drink? Oh, I drink. Ah, no worries. Oh, please, you go ahead! Well, not exactly a connoisseur, but I do love a good vino. Not fancy like you'd be used to in the city, but just simple stuff. Smells delicious, thank you. Can't remember the last time I had a home-cooked meal. Thank you, very kind. Not married, Hanna? Ellie. No, it's okay. I was. Phil and I separated about a year ago. Wow. Sorry to hear that. - Thank you. - It's okay. How old is your little girl? I saw the bike. I'm sorry, I just assumed that the girl in the photograph was your daughter. Yes, she is. Her name's Violet. We couldn't have kids of our own, so we ended up adopting. Didn't matter, though. She was ours from the moment we laid eyes on her. Gift from God. She passed. I'm sorry. I just saw the bike. Why do you always have to talk like she's gone? Because she is Elenor. Excuse me, please. Yeah, she was our little darling. Beautiful in every way. Do you mind if I ask how it happened? Not long after... everything that happened with your boy, the bus bringing the kids home from camp ran off the road and into the river. Our Violet was one of the girls that drowned. I am so sorry. I remember that happening. Happened right over there, at the side of the river. The only person who walked away was the driver. Brake failure, they called it. I think we might give her a minute, hmm? Do you like music? Yes. What are the red lights on the other side of the river? It's a memorial. For the children? Yeah. Every family on this side of the river lost a kid that day. The other side turn on red lights to show us they'll never be forgotten. That's lovely. I'm trying to move on. But for Ellie, it's like it happened only yesterday. You're the last person I expected to see back here in Billins. You and me both. So many grieving mothers. And the press in your face all the time asking questions. No chance to grieve. Why did you stop looking for my son? I tore up every inch of this property. I even ripped the heart out of that bamboo forest, most of the surrounding property. Four families got to bury their children. Guess they're the lucky ones. Lucky. You dropped the search. Too bloody hard to keep looking. Now, hang on. When Simpkin nicked himself the state government, they stopped all money, all manpower into that investigation. That was their call. Hanna, you look out there. Those cane fields go as far as the eye can see. Right, now to get through that at that time, we would've had to have burned it before the harvest was ready. That's people's livelihoods. Joey is still out there. I wish I could help you, Hanna, I do, but without new evidence, I can't. Hanna, you can't keep poking around here by yourself. Not everyone is friendly in Billins. It could get serious. Life is in your hands. Find your courage and know that you are here to serve the greater good. "Here, my love," they said to her, "it does not have to be so dark. This will strengthen you as you breathe in. My message for you, dear one, is of coming toward peace and wholeness. Rise above and search around you, radiate out from the light across the fields where it was once dark and closed inside. Explore and accept the wonder and peace of these places. It is your best way to find peace and to see the emotions, sensations of panic or fear." El. Come on, love. Hey? Okay? It's okay. Everything's okay. The currents can sweep you away in life, thrashing and resisting the flow of life. Where it hurts and it is painful, that is when restlessness and dissatisfaction take hold and shadow the lights, taking over body, mind, and psych. It causes us to suffer amnesia of the spirit. We must remind ourselves to turn towards goodness again. We forget we have agency and choice in the matter. And most heartbreaking, when we're caught in our darkness, we forget how deeply we care for our lives, our memories, and the now. Hope and light will coexist. So you must, in finding the light from the darkness, be willing to take yourself into the light and out of the shadows of memories. The more you work at finding, spreading, and teaching love, the less I will need to hold you so tight. Don't be afraid to feel in your heart. I am but a fierce and loyal reminder... Hey! No! Wait! Elenor! Bit early for you, isn't it, Hanna? Where did they go? Who? The two boys who came round here, where did they go? - Boys? - Yeah. Better come with me. Well, did you see where they went? Come on. John told me about your son. Elenor, did you see where they went? But you need not worry, Hanna. Because he's an angel now. They are all angels. And they don't ever leave us. The cane's got a way of making you feel small and alone. All that twisted nature sprung from the earth, suffocating the light. Violet used to be really scared of it. But she isn't anymore. You should have a lay down, hey? Get some rest. You'll feel much better later. Who were the boys, Elenor? Oh, God! Hanna. Hanna? Hanna. It's okay. - Just calm down. - I saw... I saw... Now stay here. Here, hold on to this. Listen, Hanna, I think it's best if you head back to the city. Coming here might have been a mistake. Who is he? What aren't you telling me? What you saw is in your head, and that's the truth of it. If it was nothing, why would a stupid red light be any help? Why would all those houses over there hang red lanterns for nothing? You've got red headlights on your bloody truck, John! Hanna, you're not to say a word of this to Elenor. I do not want her riled up, do you understand me? And you should seriously consider going home. I'm not going anywhere, John. Hello? I'm... I'm so sorry. I'm so, so, so sorry. Mama! Hey, you've got through to Julian. Sorry I can't take your call right now... Not a person. Here you are. Soda and lime. Thanks. The farmer that just left. Oh, One-Nut Riley? Did he ever run cane on the east side of the river? What's it to you? Did he ever work for him? You gotta be fuckin' kiddin', haven't you? No. I'm not. Did he ever work on Riley's farm? No, everybody knows Simpkin worked on the Drakes' land. - The Drakes? - That's until they found out who he was. Wait, where you going? You... you haven't touched your drink! Ehh. Simpkin worked for you. You forgot to mention that. You're wasting your time. Police have gone down this road. No offense, but they did a shit job. Simpkin worked for a lot of people around here. Like who? Jimmy Lipton, for one. Tom Evans. Tom Evans? Yeah. The bus driver. You knew Leonard Simpkin. What about him? I need to find where he hid my son. Hid. Nice way to put it. Please, Tom. Anything you can tell me, anything he might have said to you. Brake failure? Is that what really happened? What the hell does it matter? It happened. Tom. There's not a day that's gone past where I haven't counted the seconds where maybe I could have gone back and helped with her suitcase. Clay's boy Max. Came out on the road right in front of me. I had to lock the wheel to miss him, and... and the bus was sideways. Upside down. Underwater. The bus sank so fast that those poor kids had absolutely no idea what was going on before they drowned. How did you get out? Got lucky. Door was smashed. Coming! I thought we could have a cup of tea. You believe you're gonna find him, don't you? You know, when they brought me into that hospital to identify Violet, I didn't know who I was looking at. She was so cold, so blue! I knew it wasn't really her. The body is just a vessel for the spirit. I mean, it can't be just this, there's gotta be more than... You believe that, don't you? I admire people with faith, I do. I've just never had it. If that were true, you wouldn't be here, though. Would you? I talk to Violet all the time. She shows me things. Is that what you were doing, out in the fields at night, seeing Violet? We were supposed to harvest that very field the day after the accident. But now, we never will. You saw them, didn't you, out in the field? Oh, Elenor... I don't know what I saw. You don't have to find Joey, Hanna. He's gonna find you. Whaddya got? That'll get you a shitload of Oxys. Chuck some valiums in there as well, if you want. - No. - No? Or you want some pot? No. Well, horse is pretty popular around here. Yeah, I bet. Well, I'll take that and I'll meet you around the corner here. No, just joking, here you go. - Have a good night, then. - Yeah, funny. Nice to see you again. Shut up. Shut up! Oh my God! This them? They could be any kid's shoes, Hanna. I know his shoes. They're Joey's. He was wearing them that day. Hanna, word's gotten around, if you didn't know already. Someone's trying to prank you. - Hmph. - They're trying to scare you off. You need to drop this here, go home. Look at yourself. No good for your health. How could anyone possibly know what shoes he was wearing that day? I'm not leaving, constable. Not without my son. I'll send them to the city for testing. But if nothing comes back, you have to put an end to this. Don't touch them! Shouldn't you use gloves or something? God, you idiot! Now, you listen to me. You wanna run around here stirring up shit, then I will not think twice about driving you out of town. Do you understand me? This property wasn't searched. Not like the others. - This field... - Okay, stop! This place will drive you fucking mad. Trust me. You've gotta let it go. If it was your son... would you let it go? Oh! My Tommy, my baby! Ohh! Mommy's here to see you. - He's out there! - Who? - The boy! - What boy? - Max! - Hanna! I saw Max. You're losin' it. I'm not fucking losing it! I know what I saw! They're all in there with the children. I saw Violet, John. I saw her with my own eyes. You need to come with me and get help. Get off! I'm quite capable of walking by myself. You're the one with the limp. My wife isn't well, Hanna. And having you out in the fields, it's making her anxious. Someone put my son's shoes out on the back porch. They're letting me know he's here. Tomorrow, I want you to pack your bags... and I want you gone. How you holding up? Sticking to the plan, I hope, staying out of the pubs. A hundred percent. Good. Anything to report? Everyone in this town is a liar. Hello? Sorry. No... no, no, please wait. Please wait. I need to ask you about Max. Please. I lost my boy too. Tell me about your son. Why did the paper say that Max was on that bus? He wasn't. Wilkins said he tried to flag it down to get a lift home, but Tommy Evans knew Max. He would've stopped for him. So... So, Simpkin was working the Drake farm that season. Have you been out to the fields... I mean, since the accident. I know what goes on out there with that lot. I saw Max in the fields. What you've seen is not my son. Violet! Violet! - Max wants you to leave. - Jesus Christ! Or he'll hurt you. Violet! What do you want? I'll help you find what you're looking for. Joey. Do you know where he is, Violet? I can't go where he is. But I want to. He said you should remember his shoes. Please, Violet. Show me where he is. I have to go now. No, wait! Shh! Run! I-I want to help you. Tell... tell me what you want. How you doing? How'd that stuff I got you go the other day? What do you want, Troy? I was actually gonna ask, um... if you wanted to come get high with me. Why not? Come on, then. I thought better, that. I always thought I'd get out of Billins, you know what I mean? Why didn't you? Oh, things took a turn, didn't they? Yeah. What kind of a turn? Lost my little sister. Oh. Shit. Sorry. She meant everything to me. Mm. Bus crash, just there out front. I still see her, though. I'm not gonna let her go, you know what I mean? She's still here with me, she's here, she's here, she's here. Won't leave her behind, do you know what I mean? We've got something pretty special going on here. And you... are messing with it. Do you get me? - Okay, Troy. - Huh? I... I think you should leave. You think I should leave! You want me to leave? - No, I'm not gonna... - Just leave. No, you fucking leave, you fucking leave, right? We'll go back to your fucking room now and we'll pack the fucking bag, right? Right? You fucking joke. Is go and pack your fucking shit and fuck off, you dog. Do you understand where I'm coming from? Hey? Do you understand where I'm coming from? Let her go, now. Brother? If I ever see you back here again, I will fucking kill you. Go on, get! Fucking dog. John! - What's going on? - Everything's okay. Just go back to the house. You okay? Your son... killed my son. Yes, he did. He was broken. But he was mine. He was my boy. And I don't know what to say to you, other than I'm sorry. So sorry. Did Elenor know he was yours? No. It was my sin, my guilt to carry. On the day of the accident... that's when I found out who Lenny really was. John! Help! John! Please! I couldn't keep up. I... I tried, but my leg. No! I yelled out, I kept yelling, I... I tried to stop him. No! But I just couldn't get to him. You have to burn the field, John. My son's in that field. You don't know that. Violet showed me. Ellie won't let the field go. It's all she's got. I can't take that away from her. Violet wants to leave. - Oh, you're just saying that. - No. John, look at me. Look at me. It's what she wants. She told me. Let her go. If I burn the field, they can't see their kids anymore. It's time to let her go. Not tonight. I'm fine. We both need our sleep, love. I am fine. How long is this gonna go on for? Oh God. Elenor! John! John. Come on, John! Elenor! Come on, come on! Elenor! - Elenor! - John! Call an ambulance! John, John! John! What's happened? John! John! John! What are you doing? No! No... Violet! I haven't said goodbye. I haven't said goodbye! If I can take her... - No. - Violet! Oh, Violet! No, no... I'm sorry. I tried to say goodbye! Why? Bury it with Nan, right? Right. I didn't know if you'd want to see me. Thanks for letting me stay on. No worries. You gonna be okay? I am so sor... I am so sorry. I am so sorry.
