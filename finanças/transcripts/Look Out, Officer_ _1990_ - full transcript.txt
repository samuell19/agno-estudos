Dear ghostly brothers, here's some pocket money for you. Feel free to take it and spend as you please. I've seen all kinds of people, but I've never seen any man who behaves so much like an old woman. What do you mean, like an old woman? Today's the middle of the seventh month. That's why I'm burning paper money for the spirits. It's bad enough being poor while you're alive. It's worse being poor as a ghost. One of these is already 50 million. The grand total here adds up to more than the net worth of Li Ka-Shing! Ghosts are so much better off, I'd rather be dead! Patience. It'll be your turn one day. We've been ordered to look into a case at Hang Hau. The gate opens and the horses charge out neck and neck. No. 3 Hercules is in the lead by just half a head. Hercules is leading all the way. Come on, faster! Hercules! -It's a sure win this time! -Go Hercules! Come on! I'm gonna win this time! In third place, No. 6 Soaring Dragon, Leaping Tiger. Hercules slips down to 4th place. Damn! This horse has no stamina. I might as well jump off a building. You always say that. Why haven't you fallen to your death yet? There's nothing going on here. Let's go. According to the sergeant's briefing, nothing going on doesn't mean there's no problem. Just shut the hell up, OK? Hurry up. My daughter's expecting me home for dinner. Come off it. You're really off to see your girlfriend. What business is it of yours? If you're not going, I am. You can walk back. It's just a few blocks away. Who are you? Police! Freeze! Freeze! Go to hell! You wanna run? You're not getting away! Freeze! Don't move. Just make one more move and I'll blow your head off! You're a bold one! Damn you, you old geezer! You stink! Isn't that great? Before you even see me, you can smell my aroma. Get on with it. OK. What if there's really evidence in the warehouse? Can he handle it alone? I'd better go back and take a look. Biu... Biu! CHEUNG BIU Ceausescu. Marcos. Am I dead? Gambler cop unable to repay high-interest debt, commits suicide! This isn't correct. I was killed while investigating a drug syndicate. Do you know who killed you? I didn't see his face. HEAVEN'S COURT Then are you willing to plead guilty to suicide? No. Then the cause of death remains unknown. Your Honor, please let me return to investigate. This isn't a casino. You can't come and go as you please! Your Honor, we're both civil servants. Can't you just give me a break? A break? That depends on whether you know the rules. Rules? Will this do? Sure! -I'm off then. -Wait. There are two things you must remember. Whoever has such a birthmark will be your savior. If it's like this, he'll be your doom. There's also this personal gift from me. What is it for? It's full of charms and spells you'll find useful. Spells? How will I find my savior? You're a cop. The police station is where you belong. The police station? Hey, sit upright. Which room? Number one. Number one. Number two. Number three. Lucky me... Let's play a game. Give me the cards. If you guess correctly, you win. Watch closely. Let's have another go. The training officer's here. -Give it. -What? You're good. But it won't help. I'll deal. Number one. Number two. Number three. No, thanks. Come on in, don't be afraid. Over there... Take off your pants. Hurry up. Wait. What are you doing? Taking cover. Will this work? Sure... I can see. But they can't. Turn around. This damned kid is my savior. Bend over. What for? In-depth inspection. Bend over. In-depth inspection? Hurry up. Bend over. My savior. God knows who's saving whom? No! Switch. I said bend over! In-depth inspection! Bend over! Miss, you'd better co-operate. I'm already co-operating. Who told you to be a freelance prostitute? What do you mean, officer? Don't play dumb with me, bitch. VICE SQUAD Who's playing dumb? You were the one who told me to sit here. Talking back now, huh? Who's talking back? That's talking back! You're sick! You're the only one who dares talk back! Who's talking back? Good morning. Sorry. Excuse me. Hi, how are you? Excuse me! Sorry. Sorry. It's you? It's me. Who are you? Officer 1997, reporting for duty. Why would HQ send someone like this here? What are you doing? Your dad is calling for you. It's your old man. He couldn't repay his gambling debts to loansharks, so he jumped to his death. That's your old man. -Sorry, my apologies. -Cut the crap and come with me. What are we doing here? What do you think? Good. -Taking a piss, officer? -Good guess. Lift your foot. Lift it! Hey! Move your foot. What the hell are you doing, ma'am? This is a men's toilet. What are you doing here? You ask me what I'm doing here? I've been mopping this floor for decades. You think I'm in here for the scenery? Besides, what shape or size haven't I seen before? What a shame. Are you insulting me? Don't mess with her, officer. If you get her mad, you'll land yourself in trouble. Who the hell is she supposed to be? The only thousand-year-old virgin left on earth. If you get her juices up, the whole police force won't be able to deal with her. Are you up for it? 324, 325, 326, 32-- 327, 328, 329, 330, 331... Gorgeous. 300... what's my count? 332. Thank you. 332. None of your business, close the door! What are you two doing in here? Nothing. I've brought him to get his gun. Come here. Your number? 1997. EVIDENCE Sign here. Here? Here. You're new here, so I'll give you a simple assignment. I've already sent two female officers to go undercover in a massage parlor. Go and contact them. When the time is right, reveal your identity and arrest the whole lot. Simple. You call that simple? Bullshit! Would I send you for something complicated? Who are the undercover cops? They're the ones wearing fishnet stockings. When you get there, just say the secret code for the mission and they'll know who you are. What's the secret code? "From now on..." What about you? I'll oversee the whole operation from here and provide you with backup if need be. -That's it then. -Hurry up and go! Let me take a nap. FIVE-STAR MASSAGE SERVICE What would you like, boss? Looking for a girl? This way please. You go ahead. We have the best in Hong Kong. Take your time. Thanks. You won't find better ones elsewhere. They're all first class. Every girl is young and pretty. I'd like to check out their legs first. I don't care about the face, but... I'm a leg man when it comes to women. OK... Girls, lift your skirts. Let him have a good look. Higher... Well? Not bad. Which one do you fancy? All of them. All of them? That's not possible? Sure... all of you, get up. Have fun! You're amazing. Go on. Don't be so impatient. Six in one go! What a crazy bastard! What's the matter with you? Taking so long! These fishnets itch like crazy! How come they're all gone? Isn't this better? The guy who's coming to contact us won't be making any mistakes. Wait... Hold your horses! Wait. I have something very important to say. "From now on." From now on, Hong Kong has a new policy on Vietnamese boat people. From now on, any boat people coming to Hong Kong as a result of economic circumstances will be treated as illegal immigrants. Great... But you haven't understood what I mean. Sure we do. We're all from Vietnam. Sorry, I'm in the wrong place. Many apologies. Hey, you're leaving? What's the matter, man? He's leaving after just taking a look. -That's right. -What a jerk. Son of a bitch! What are you up to? Actually, I'm a university student. I'm doing a statistical survey on hookers... I mean, prostitutes. A student? Which school? The Hirstute Institute. The Hirstute Institute? The Hirstute Feline Studies Institute. Which is to say... You get it. Goodbye. Where's your student ID? A student ID's not a personal ID, you're not required to carry it all the time. Didn't you know that? Student? We're the real students here. That's a student's ID card. Really? What faculty? Social science. I'm moonlighting at a triad. Working part-time to pay your way! How admirable! Keep it up. How dare you indecently assault a policewoman? Police? Bullshit. Bring them over. Come on, you fat bitch. You have guts, messing on my turf! "From now on." Why didn't you get here earlier? Better late than never. On the floor, all of you! Police! Don't play with guns. You're still a student! Don't you know it's dangerous? Give it to me, that's a good boy. Stop! He said stop! You want to get me killed? Son of a bitch! I'm telling you, it's not your head I want to smash right now, it's your goddamn mouth! Disgusting! Bust his head open, Big Brother! Just playing with you, you coward. If it was for real, you'd be pissing in your pants. Help! Cut it out... This son of a bitch's a real lame ass. Don't... What's the matter? Cuff them up. Is it sorted? All sorted out. Bloody cat! Shitting on the altar again! What a stink! Apologies, Grandmaster. Your disciple requests your spiritual instruction. I call upon your divine presence. Long arms, long legs, everything can be long. Bastard! Cockroach grappling! You can't run now! Apologies, Grandmaster. Our home's too dirty. Oh no! Relationship disaster! That's bad. Yuk, don't go yet. Dad, what's the matter? Red glow on cheek, watery eyes. This forebodes disaster. You must be extra careful with men! Why should I? In case you're revisited with bad karma. Dad, what have you done this time? Never mind, just be careful. Alright, don't worry. I'm off. Bye! -Don't be too late. -OK. It's my fault for messing with people's daughters. Now that my own daughter's grown up, I hope nothing bad comes back upon her! -Going out? -Yes. Nice. Even nicer if the skirt's shorter. Wow, what a mess! It looks like a kennel! How could anyone live like this? You again? They gave me a dead man's quarters? It's impossible. Fire services... no, police! Looks real smart! I am Royal Royal Hong Kong Po... Police, number 1997. You have the right to remain silent, so you don't have to talk, but anything you say may be used as evidence in court. May I ask where the door is? Thanks. Hi. Hi. I'm turning around. Running fast doesn't work. I'll walk slowly. This is not working. What do I do? Impossible. Hi. I must be daydreaming! I'm sick! Sick in the head! I must have gone crazy! Stop it! I said I quit. I want to go home. You can't escape. I'll try again. I told you, you can't escape. You asked for it. Now do you believe me? Yes. What's so funny? I am scared. Weren't you scared enough just now? That's the way I am. Say what you have to say. Alright, I will. I have a savior, and another who'll bring me doom. There's a plum-blossom shaped birthmark on your ass. That means you're my savior. The one who'll bring me doom I haven't found yet. What did I do to deserve this? How would I know? It's ordained from above. No, please, I beg you! I don't even know you, leave me alone! It's not me who's messing with you. We're both being messed with from above. Did you think you were really so great, you could fight one against nine in the massage parlor? Did you think with just a single breath you could blow up that girl's skirt? So it was you! It was me. Here's what we'll do. I can help you get that girl, and you help me back. How's that? I can't, I'm not up for it. So you won't? It's too sudden. I can't do it! You really won't? Forget it. Alright, wait and see. Ghost! Sir. Nothing. What a nutcase! Do you believe in ghosts? Sure! They really exist. Then have you ever seen one? No. I don't know if that's a good thing or not. If he'll help you, you've got it made! Really? Yeah! What if he doesn't help? Then you'll be in trouble. In trouble? What's the matter? You've seen a ghost? Then you're in deep shit. No way, I'm fine. I'm having a lucky streak. I've never been in any sort of shit my whole life. Right. What are you doing? I stepped on a nail. It didn't go into the flesh, so it doesn't count. That isn't bad enough? Get going, there's nothing to see. What's the matter? That Vietnamese man won't come down. Don't we have a negotiator? They couldn't convince him. I was OK just now. Strictly speaking, it wasn't so bad. Alright... it wasn't bad... get to work. You go up first, I'll be right with you. He's up there. Brother. It's nothing, I just wanted to ask you, have you ever, in your entire life... seen a ghost? -Seen a ghost? -Yes. No. Why? Did you see one? No. Who is it? Who's throwing rubbish? You look like shit. Are you OK? I'm OK... let's get to work. Sir, don't give in to despair. There's nothing that can't be worked out. -What more is there to say? -Come down first. I must die! -Calm down, let's talk it out. -Hey, brother. Don't come up... Brother, calm down, take it easy. If you come any nearer, I'll jump! Listen to me, brother. Just listen to me. Don't be a fool. Think back to when you left Vietnam, leaving your home, braving the stormy seas, enduring so much hardship along the way, until you finally reached this place. It was all for freedom, right? Have you heard the saying, "Life is valuable, but freedom is even more so?" No! Don't say anything more. You Hongkongers are all hypocrites. Each one of us Vietnamese... -Suffered so much to come to Hong Kong. -I know... And now, you are so inhumane to send us back! Do you know that if we go back we're dead for sure? Since I'm dead anyway, I might as well jump off from here. Brother, maybe you won't be repatriated. -How's everything? -They're still negotiating. -Sir. -I'll go and help. Don't you read the news? Chai Ling's gone to France, Hou Dejian's returned to Taiwan, and on TV too! Hi! Sorry to interrupt. -What are you doing up here? -Just want to chat... They're different, the whole world supports them. We're Vietnamese. You'll repatriate us just like that! You've forced us into a dead end. Think about it. What else have you got to say? -I want to ask you-- -There's nothing more to consider. Think about what I just said. Sorry to disturb you for a while more. I wanted to ask you, if the ghost wants to mess with you and you ignore him, do you think you'll die a horrible death? It's precisely because you've ignored us. If not, we wouldn't have to go down this road. Damn it, stop messing around! If you want to die, get on with it. Stop interrupting our conversation. You come here, we pay for your shelter and food, why the hell are you still making a fuss? Who the hell do you think you are? If you've got the guts, jump off right now! You asked me to jump! -I'm really jumping! -Go ahead! No, don't! Help me pull him back! What are you doing here? -Hey, brother, don't do it. -I'll push you! Sing! Get up! What are you lazing around for? Sing, are you alright? I'm in deep shit. OK, you win. I give up. Come on out. The thing you talked about yesterday, let's talk it over. You'll agree to it? It's you who's begging me now. Without me, you'll be in deep shit for sure. From now on, our partnership's official. I'll help you get girls, and help with your career. I'll take your word for it. What do you want me to help you with? It's very simple. Find out who murdered me, and then avenge my death. You're the only one who can deal with him. That's not a simple matter at all! What? Are you taking back your word? No, I want you to help me first. What? Getting the girl. See how good you are. I knew you'd ask for something like that. I have one more request. Can you let me touch you? Sure. I've never touched a ghost before, I'm so nervous! It's no big deal. My turn? Come on. That was powerful. More light from that one. Yes. Too bright, turn it down a bit. Is this OK? Yes, OK. Get your Cow brand chocolate today. Cow brand chocolate. Fragrant, sweet and delicious! -Cut. OK with the camera? -No problem. Good, OK. Looking is enough, huh? No need to get the girl. I'm waiting for you. For me? Give her this flower, and then just say to her, "You're very beautiful, I like you a lot." That's it? Sure. Let's see if you got what it takes. Go and try. I have what it takes. I'm worried your idea won't work. Believe me, it will. It's just a matter of daring to go over. Of course I am daring, more than enough. My idea is guaranteed to work, more than enough. But I reckon you don't have the nerve. You're very beautiful, and I like you a lot. You like it? It's so cute. Even a cow ignores me, and you want me to talk to her. It just isn't working. I told you you weren't up to it. Now you've got competition. Go on. Mr. Dang, what brought you here today? I've come to take a look at my commercial. How's the shoot going? Isn't that our female star? Yes... come... I'll introduce you. This is our boss, Mr. Dang Lee Yang. This is our star, Yuk. How do you do. These flowers are for you. How about joining me for tea? Sorry, the commercial shoot is still going on. -Director. -Yes... What's the matter with you? Aren't you done yet? Done? Listen up, the boss says we're done for the day. Put everything away. Are you free to join me now? Sorry, even if I'm not doing this commercial, I'm still not having a drink with you. What do you mean? How dare you turn down an invitation from our boss? Be a hero. Rescue the damsel in distress! Yes! What are you doing with your gun? Even if you're apprehending a thief, your gun's still only the last resort! Faint heart never won fair maiden. Show some courage! There are so many of them. Don't worry. I'm right here. I'll sort it out for you. No... but what should I say? Let go! Let go! Who do you think you are, kid? Scram! How dare you harass a lady in broad daylight? What? Think you're some kind of hero, don't you? A knight to the rescue? He's all yours! Get him! Don't! Don't fight! Stop it! Stop it! I advise you to stay cool. Hey, you... A stupid hero like you is really hard to find. I really have to hand it to you. You wouldn't let me draw my gun, and you sat here to watch me get beaten up! You call this helping me out? I have helped you, you just don't know it. -You're still... -Sir. Are you alright? I'm fine. Thank you for what you've done. Don't mention it. The moon is above the willows. A date is awaiting after sunset. -What's wrong? -You scared me to death. Next time, give me some warning. I've helped you get the girl. Now it's your turn to avenge me. No problem, but I've got a date with her. At least let me have some fun first! You're always getting the best part of the deal. What about our agreement? Sorry. Today, it doesn't matter if God himself comes looking for me. Alright, you wait and see. -Miss Lee, how are you? -How are you, sir? -Nice to meet you. -Are you alright? -I'm fine. Shall we sit over there? -Sure. Thanks. So what do you busy yourself with, Miss Lee? I do commercials. Really? -Commercials. That's... -Your gun's rubbing against me. Sorry. So then, you must be doing well. What's that? How come you've got two guns? Yes. Wait. Alright, you win. Give me half an hour, OK? Half an hour's enough. Please help. Have some peanuts. Stop messing around. Ditching your friend for a girl. It's gone. What's the matter? The third gun. Why are we looking for leads here? If we find nothing, just take it as a road trip. I'll take a look first. Hey, what are you doing? Police! You have the right... What are you doing here? Get him! Don't come near, or I'll shoot! -Go quickly! -Stop! I'm going to shoot! -Who are you trying to scare? -You in the dark glasses! Can it! I'm going to shoot! Ain't me! Me neither! The one with the axe, stop staring at me. I'm going to shoot! Ain't me. The one in blue. Stop bossing around! I'll chop you up! Ain't me. -Chop him up! -I'll shoot you. -Chop him up! -I'll shoot you. What's going on? Boss, we can't stop now. Hurry up and sort him out. He's got a gun. He's outnumbered. He's only got six shots, what's there to fear? What if he really shoots? The worst case is half of you die, you may not be one of them! What? You're in charge here now. I'll go round from the rear. If it's so simple, anyone could be boss! Chop him up! Scared yet? Hey. If you promise to help me, -I'll sort them out for you right away. -Of course I'll help you! But don't you know I only have six bullets? You can't do it, but I can. -Really? -Get him! -Got it. -Uncle Biu, it's no time for jokes. Chop him up! It really worked! What are you standing there for? Call an ambulance, quick! SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE Come in. -Madam. -Madam. HONG KONG KARATE COMPETITION 1990 FIRST PLACE It was you who solved the drug case yesterday? -Yes, Madam. -Yes, Madam. Good. The bosses are very pleased with your performance. They've asked me to write a report, and give you your just rewards. Thank you, Madam. It was a very dangerous situation yesterday. Madam, Sing is new here. It was very dangerous situation yesterday. Due to his lack of experience, he panicked yesterday. He's unable to recall the entire episode. In order not to waste your valuable time, I think I can handle this report alone. Very well. You may leave now. No, but... Out, please. Damn it. -Are you mad? -Yes. I know what to do. What is it? The lewd spell. The lewd spell? A dozen guys came charging out, so I had to protect Sing. Well, is it fixed yet? Look. Hey, that was fun. Let's have another go. Come on! What? Are you nuts? Get lost! Given the situation, I immediately drew my gun. Is your gun big and long? Not quite, Madam. Not that big. Let me see. -What are you doing, Madam? -Come on. -No, Madam! -Don't be shy. Come on, let me have a look. -Madam, I... -Come on. I don't want it, I can't do it. How can I show it here? I'll let you see mine. Are they big? -Do you want it? -I can't do this. I can't take it anymore. I want it! -Madam... -Do you want it or not? I don't know if I should... Come on. Madam... I can't... I can't take it! Grab her. We're letting him off so easily? Madam... That's too easy on him. No way! Madam, have you gone crazy? What were you doing? Nothing. You told me to do it. Bullshit! How dare you sexually harass your superior? No, inspector, you ordered me to! I ordered you? Alright. What did you see just now? -Nothing. -We didn't see anything. He was on top of you, but none of us saw anything. Son of a bitch! You betrayed me! Get in. Don't beat me! No! Dad. Dad, what happened to you? Forget it. Just a rotten day. Dad, I want you to meet my new boyfriend. New boyfriend? Who is he? Guess. My daughter will obviously go for someone tall, hunky, brilliant, not to mention cute. You'll meet him in a while. Dad, let's agree on this first. All that matters is I like him, OK? -Yuk... -For me? Yeah. Come, meet my father. OK. Dad, this is my boyfriend. Hello. It's you? -Yes, what a coincidence! -That's right. Do you know each other? Yes. That's right. He's the one I kept telling you about, the tall, hunky, brilliant, whom I respect the most, boss of mine. So, he's your dad. Alright. Let's sit down and chat. Thanks. How can it be him? But I promised Yuk to agree as long as she likes him. Just you wait and see. Dinner's ready, we can eat soon. I'll pour you some tea first. Thank you. Get up, you son of a bitch. You sold me out, and now you're after my daughter? Sir, it was your own fault just now. Shut up! I'm telling you, if you're smart, you'll let me punch you! How dare you duck? Why shouldn't I? You dare to duck, and hit back as well? I'll not let you hit back! Dad! Sing! What are you doing? Nothing... Your boyfriend's a real hunk. Uncle is quite strong as well. No! You're brilliant! Still very strong at your age! You're not too bad yourself. I didn't realise you got on so well. Dinner's ready. Come on, let's eat. Dig in. Yuk's a good cook. You'll love it. Of course. -Add more soy sauce if it's too bland. -Thank you. Add some chilli sauce if it's not spicy enough. Yuk made the chilli sauce herself. So, he can't take spicy food. Try this chilli sauce. Made from the hottest pepper, very tasty. Delicious. You don't know what you're missing until you try it. You like hot food too? Yes. Then eat up. Ah! I forgot the soup. You're doing it on purpose. -Are you eating up or not? -No. Open your mouth. Dad, you ate the shrimp? It's great, though he likes it more spicy. He said it's better if you add chilli sauce to the rice. That's the way he likes it. So, you like chilli sauce as much as I do. You're good! Look, it's all over your face. Don't just have rice. Try the dishes. -Thanks. -Come on. You don't like it? I'll let dad have it. Here, dad. No? Then I'll eat it myself. Eat up... Great. Come on. What are you doing? Yuk! There's something weird about that kid. A spirit's helping him out against you. Then what should I do? I'll check it out for you. I'll give you an amulet for now. -It'll temporarily protect you. -Thank you, master. What are you doing on the floor? Watching TV. Hey, what a coincidence. You've been head over heels with Yuk lately. Have I? No! Do you have that what-you-call-it... Lewd spell? Can you lend it to me? Are you crazy? You want to use it on Yuk? She's my friend's daughter! If you need the spell to get a girl, you're hopeless! It wouldn't mean anything even if you get the girl. Do you know how potent the spell is? There's no stopping it once it's released. I'll not teach you such powerful thing. Forget it. I just wanted to find out more. I'm tired. I'm going to take a nap. Why did you bring me to your home all of a sudden? It's no big deal, really. Just thought we'd have a casual chat and some tea. Just to further our relationship. Oh, it's you? Kam, Sing's here. I have to get going. You're leaving already? Once it's released, the spell can't be stopped. I'd better put it on the cat. You... Hey. What's the matter? Looking for Yuk? She hasn't come back yet. You... I've got to go. I said Yuk hasn't come back yet. I know. What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What are you doing? Kam... I'm so bored. Son of a bitch! What are you doing? Stop it! -Sing. -Why don't you want to try? -Let go! -Kam. What are you doing? Your boyfriend's gay! -Why do you say such a thing? -Because you are! What did I do? You came on to me, you faggot! Yuk... Yuk, listen to me. I didn't know what I was doing. I was under a spell, a lewd spell. What lewd spell? Stop trying to fool me! Nobody will believe you. It's true. I got the lewd spells from Uncle Biu. What? Which Uncle Biu? Your ex-colleague Cheung Biu. You're crazy! He's been dead for ages. That's it! I've no choice but to tell the truth now. Uncle Biu's inside this gun. What the hell are you talking about? You must be a better liar than me! Uncle Biu, show yourself quickly! You have to help me. You know my superior. Come on! Just ignore him, dad. Let's go. Yuk, give me two minutes. I'll be right back. It's all my fault. I stole your spell. But if you don't appear, I'm dead. I'll slap myself three times. Will that do? What's this mumbo-jumbo? Not enough? Don't blame me then. I don't want to do this either. You're forcing me. Can't take anymore, right? If you'd come out earlier like I asked, you wouldn't have to suffer like this. I really think he's gone nuts! Something must have gone wrong! You're right. Let's take a look. What are you doing? Why are you peeing like this? -Oh, no, Uncle Biu! -Get out. I don't want to see you anymore! Yuk... You pissed on me and tried to flush me away! -Give me a chance to explain. -Hi! Hey! Now you see, there's really a ghost. I didn't lie to you. Yuk. What are you doing here? They say my cause of death is unknown. Where else can I go but up here? Is that a reason to be messing about up here? So what if I am? How dare you throw your weight around in my absence? What's with the argument? Who's throwing his weight around now? -Don't be mad. -Shut up. It's none of your business. You son of bitch! You're the cause of all this trouble! I asked you to come and you didn't. Now you appear without being called for. Sing, getting the girl and a promotion, the good and bad, I've done it for you. Now I've exposed myself. You must hurry up and find my murderer. I hope so too. But you don't even know who he is, or what he looks like. How can I find him? It's not that I don't want to help you. Now that I think about it, when he killed me he had a heavy smell on him. What kind of smell? A stench. I have it too. How do we find him? You smell of sweat, not a stench. Understand? What? What I just said. What did you just say? Kuen, I'm over here. Come here, quick! Cheung! Long time no see! Where have you been? Nowhere. Just getting a haircut. You look smart. Thanks. -What are you doing? -What are you doing? It's nothing. What a nutcase! I've had rotten luck lately, lost a lot. So stop gambling. How can I? You again? What's up with you? Just for a sniff. Uncle Biu, this is where you were killed. They aren't idiots. Why would they still be hanging around? Haven't you heard that the most dangerous place is the safest? They think I'm dead and gone. It won't occur to them a dead man would seek revenge. That's fair enough. If I hadn't bumped into you, I wouldn't have expected any of this. Climb over from here. I did this the last time I was here. There really are drugs! Hey... Hurry up! You're always so slow. What are you doing? Take it easy! What are you doing? Watch it! -Are you OK? -Quick! Kill him! Uncle Biu, can you let me have some fun? You want some fun? Sure. Having fun? Too bad I didn't bring a camera. I've hit the jackpot! Thanks, Uncle Biu! Son of a bitch! This is my turf! Smells awful! -Damn you! -He's the one! What do you want? I don't like that one. I'm out of here. Where are you going? Hey... I'm sure I shot him! How could he still run? Playing tricks? He's not playing tricks, he's got a charm. A charm! Good thing I have your amulet, otherwise I'd be dead. He was murdered by you. Now he's sending this kid to avenge him. Old bastard! Still after me even after he's dead! Master, you must get rid of him. Don't worry. You just stay here. I've already devised a way to deal with him. Grandmaster on high, your disciple's been messed around by Cheung Biu and that damned kid Sing. It's all their fault that my life's so miserable, and the kid's even after my daughter. Grandmaster, your power knows no bounds. Please sort this out for your disciple. The Grandmaster came down from heaven! Disciple Li Kam. I know of your oppression by Cheung Biu's ghost, hence I've descended upon this earth to give you this magical spell. Put it inside the gun barrel and you'll be able to imprison that troublesome ghost. Thank you, Grandmaster! -Go, and do as you are instructed. -Yes. Sing, going out for a date? Yes. -Are you bringing your gun? -Yes. Why? You're going out with Yuk, it's not good to bring a gun. It's dangerous to leave the gun. What's to worry? We all have our private life. -You don't work 24/7, silly. -You've got a point. This old man's a real pain. I'll let you two reminisce about the old days. Alright, off you go then. Dad, we're off. Bye! Bye. No need to hurry back. I will. I'm going to sleep. I'll keep you in there for a few days. Let me out! You're never coming out again. It's our Black Sect's "coffin trap". This is your doom! In no time, your spirit will dissipate. -Yuk. -What? We've been embracing for a long time. Yes. How do you feel? It's fun. How about this? Let's try something else. What? Say... Kissing. No, it'll be too embarrassing if we're seen. No one will see us. Who said there's no one? What's the matter? You should know. No, I don't. Do you know? Yes, I do. Nothing's the matter. If nothing's the matter, off you go. Uncle Biu. You know me? No... It's a misunderstanding. I don't know you. He's had enough exercise today. Let's go. Bye. Over there. Hurry. Why'd you come so early? Give me a chance to show off. Be careful. Are you alright? Lie down. I'll get you some medication. There's no reason for him not to save me. Biu, at last I have you where I want you. Grandmaster, please accept my gratitude. I thank you for your magical charm that has locked Biu away. Sing. This time, I can take revenge on Biu and Sing. So, you were behind everything! Dad, why are you doing this? Because they've both been messing with me. Dad, Sing almost got beaten to death by Dang's people. Dang Lee Yang still dares to show his face? Cut the crap. Let Uncle Biu out first. Uncle Biu. Let me do it. Alright. Uncle Biu, come on out. What is it, Sing? Uncle Biu! He's asleep. Get up, it's dawn, Uncle Biu... Come out. Don't you pretend. Impossible! Let me ask the Grandmaster. Grandmaster, I've removed the spell, but Cheung Biu's not coming out. Have I done anything wrong? Please advise me! Your thoughts are depraved, unworthy disciple! You've been used by demons, and caused great mischief. I never came down from heaven, nor gave you those evil spells to oppress the good. Then who's taken Uncle Biu? This demon is Cheung Biu's doom, instructed by Biu's enemy Dang Lee Yang to disguise himself as me. He used my unworthy disciple to abduct Biu who's now locked inside a coffin trap. How can we save him? The coffin trap is a thing of great evil. Even my powers are unable to counteract it. Then Uncle Biu's dead for sure. Grandmaster, have mercy! There must be a way! I can only write the counteracting spell on your body. If you can find him, you can save Cheung Biu. Then please, hurry. Miss, please retreat. Yes. Grandmaster, hurry! I'm ticklish! Grandmaster, please hurry up. MALE AND FEMALE VIRGINS' URINE DIVINE... Sorry, but it really tickles! Can we continue tomorrow? Finished? The Grandmaster's gone. Let me see. -How come it's all smudged? -Really? Maybe I scratched a bit off. Can you see it clearly? Yes. Let me see. Female virgin's urine. Cat's stool upon the altar. Divine... Divine what? Fart, the Divine's fart. Don't... don't peep at my ass. -I'll let you see mine next time. -Really? Really. Thank the Grandmaster. Thank you, Grandmaster. Why is the cat not eating? It's all seafood, this should do! PURE EPSOM SALT Well? Has it eaten yet? No. That's really weird. It doesn't seem to want to eat at all. You're normally so mean to it and don't feed it well. Now all of a sudden you're giving all this good stuff. It must be afraid you want to poison it. What should we do? I'll give a demonstration, so it will follow suit and start eating. Sounds good. Go on then. I'm a cat. Now you watch. Such great food! What a waste if you don't eat it! Nice fish! A little bit too salty. You've gobbled it all up. What are we going to do? I was giving it a chance to watch clearly. See? It needs a demonstration. It's all fresh, though the taste is a little strange. Well, I just added a little bit of epsom salt. What do you want? Demonstrate shitting. Otherwise it won't do it. Watch. Come on, take a shit. Demonstration's over. Your turn now. Ma'am. What is it, Sir? Not off work yet? Almost, as soon as I finish this. I know that you must be very tired, so I've brought you something to drink. How kind! And such a big bottle! Don't mention it. Wait, let me get a mug. No need, drink from the bottle. The whole bottle? That's what makes it fun. True. You're really great! There's more. Come on... another one. There's more? -Finished. -You really are great! The weather's too hot. -Here you go. -Again? Alright. Finish it. This is marvellous, want some more? Damn. All finished. I'll go and buy some more, please wait. Strange kid! So nice to me all of a sudden. You'll need to pee for sure! You pervert! Peeping tom! Buying me drinks all of a sudden. I knew you were up to no good! No one takes advantage of me that easily! There's another peeping tom. You pervert! Hey! Wait! Hey. Done. That works. Sing, you've made me eat so many baked sweet potatoes and a whole lot of peanuts! Is this enough yet? I can't take it anymore. Just hang on for a bit longer. Wait till I get this filter fixed. Don't just eat, drink some water too. Water too? Ready. Begin. Grandmaster on high. Your humble disciple piously invokes your divine presence to descend upon me. It's coming. Great! Go on. Harder. A bit more, go on. More... Almost there. Hold it. Your ass can hold so much gas. This is like a performance. Go on... Stop! Enough! I can't stop! What a stink! What a stink! Of course it stinks! You think I asked for this? Damn it! All gone! Quick! Help get the fart back! It's almost all gone! Hurry! What is it? I've got to hand it to you, holding it in your mouth! Cat stool upon the altar. Female virgin's urine. Divine fart. Ready. Go! -Done. -Great! -Bring it all along to save Biu! -Yeah! Ready? Ready. This one? Bring a bigger one. This is for travelling. It's trendy now. -Will it work? -Of course. Let's go. That way. It's really here. Uncle Biu, we're here to rescue you. Cut the crap. Hurry up and get him out! No response. Hey! Why didn't you say hey? I was afraid too much would overkill it. You've got a point. Damn! We've fallen into a trap! This isn't the real coffin trap! You guessed correctly. All I needed was a fake coffin, and I've destroyed the counter-measures you must have gone to such lengths to procure. The real coffin trap... is here. Biu. Unless you can get another lot of counter-measures, there's no way you can save this old ghost. You two are really stupid. He called us stupid. That's right, but still smarter than him. Attack! Ridiculous! How dumb can you get? We have more guns than you do. Shoot! Shoot, and you'll turn into a hornet's nest. What is it? Without the damned ghost's help, how could you shoot me? You want to play? Fine. Come on, I'll play with you. I don't want to shoot you. -Biu. -Get them! Bastard! -Uncle Biu! -Biu! Think you can take me with a little trick like that? Wow, Biu, you're marvellous! Uncle Biu, that was great! Cover me, I'll go flatten him. Sing. Sing, are you alright? Uncle Biu, aren't you covering me? I can't cover shit. -I can't even take care of myself. -What? Biu, it's your turn. He's so ugly, no way! Uncle Biu! Help me! If you don't help, Sing will be dead! What can I do? I don't even know whether I'm a man or a woman! Why are you talking such rubbish? Uncle Biu, what happened to you? -I don't know. -Sexy moustache you have there. Stop it. This is disgusting! I can't take it anymore! The Grandmaster shows his great power. The Fu So Sword. Sing, are you hurt? Uncle Biu, have you been castrated? Let me take a look. Damn it! Don't touch! The others will see! I'll fight with you, evil spirit. Great... Damn, he can't hold on. Didn't I tell you to bring a bigger one? You never listen! Vile monster, let go of me. Uncle Biu, what are we going to do? I don't have any charms on me. Charms? I've got one! What is it? Even my powers are useless, what good is a charm? Take it back! Ass on fire, hurry! You look like Maradona. There's more? Not even Pele could do better. One more, please! Hey, that's too big! Untangle my hands. Alright! Didn't the Grandmaster say with the three items we can break the spell on Uncle Biu? How come it's not working? Maybe it should be four items instead of three. Four items? Look at him. It must be the virgin boy's urine that's missing. Virgin boy's urine? Must have scratched off that bit. What are we going to do now? Hurry and get a virgin boy's urine! Done! Coming right up! You're still a virgin? Here it comes, virgin boy's urine! -Is it for real? -It's for real! Give me the charm. Catch. -What now? -How would I know? -That monster's very powerful. -Take this away first. -The monster wants to take us with him. -What? Lift the iron sheet. Give me a push. -Biu, are you alright? -Uncle Biu. Uncle Biu, are you alright? Grandmaster, how can a ghost get injured? The Grandmaster's long gone. How was I supposed to know? My spirit's diffused. I fear I can't take revenge. Biu. Dang Lee Yang, where are you? Come out! Yuk. Looking for me? I'm here. -Yuk. -Don't move. Shoot if you've got the guts. One against one. I've got nothing to lose. Put down your gun! Put down your gun, she's my daughter. Don't do it. You're dead either way. What are we going to do now? Everything depends on you. On me? Put down the gun at once! Hurry up, put it down. Holy shit! Yuk, are you alright? -Yuk, wake up. -Luckily, she's OK. You've done it. -Dad. -Biu. Yuk. I've had my revenge. I have to report back now. -Uncle Biu. -Come. What is it? I'll see you off. I'm going up to heaven, not on a trip. Are you coming along to die with me? You've got a point. See you again. See me again? You have a long way to go. Don't worry. I'll be the first in line to see you. I'll be coming to see you before long. Goodbye. Watch your step now. Burn me some paper money on the Tomb-sweeping Day! Take care! Write if you have time! You want to go to heaven? No way. Why not? I've proved I'm a good person. Why can't I go to heaven? There's an immigration quota in heaven. It's full at the moment. With your qualifications, entry won't be easy. Then what should I do? You can invest. You can jump the queue as an investor immigrant. Did you bring any money? Damn, I didn't bring any this time. No money. Then go to hell. There's no entry fee there. Who's Cheung Biu? Delivery for you. That's me. Who's smart enough to know I'd be needing money? You two? Thank you. Welcome to heaven. We always have your best interests at heart. Let's go, lunch is on me. Great. Hey, what are we going there for? I was just about to ask you. Enjoy yourself. That's right, goodbye. Don't go.
