THE WAGES OF FEAR Lemon cordial, vanilla, coffee, almond... Some alms, sir. Be charitable. Bleach yourself a bit, the sun hit you pretty hard. I'll bleach your tongue, that's what I'll bleach. I hate mutts! Nobody asked you. Hey, Doc, nobody asked you. That guy's a lucky bastard. I'd like a job like that. It's for voters only. You got your card? I never thought I'd beg for a job. For tramps, there's never any work. Well, what'll you have? Make up your minds. A lemonade. One for all of you? Get it and shut up! You're always so nice and polite. Rose, a lemonade for the doctor. Right away, sir. Looking for trouble? So few distractions here. If only it wasn't so hot! Why do we hang around here? Coming tonight? Maybe. You got them? In the flour bag. Kiss me. Watch out for my suit! Linda, come here! At the flour again? Don't I feed you? I didn't eat your flour. Caught in the act. I'll show you. Forget it. Mind your business. He's itching for trouble. Who asked you? You're just a pack of tramps... Only fit for loafing. And scaring away all the customers. Scram or I'll call the cops. They may be interested in your papers. Oh, a squealer? I'm a citizen, not a lousy foreigner. What a credit to the white race! What do you want? Did you hear me? Beat it! If I ever hear that you touched a hair on her head... Me? I wouldn't hurt her. On the contrary, I only want to help her. Don't I, baby? Go to my room, I'll be right up. Leave that. You want trouble. Get going, you lousy tramp. You cheap tramp. Get going! - You don't own the street. - Stay there! I'll have the immigration guys check on you tomorrow. Dirty rat! Louse! Going upstairs or not? Where's that lazy tramp? Here. The mail! Didn't you hear the plane? Get to the airport! Hurry! The money I've lost because of you! - What's going on? - Take me along? Move! If I ever meet the right pilot, he'll let me ride with the baggage. I'll show him my U.S. visa. It's real. Did I show it to you? You've showed it to everyone. That's a mistake. Don't flash it. Hi, Pepito, what's new? Listen, Boss, I got my passport. Next. Come here. Any baggage? No. Passport? Yes, I got one. What brings you here? I don't know yet. We'll put down "tourist". - What's wrong? - A traffic jam. Come on! The lady and the child. That's right. Smile. That'll be a dollar. Wait, maybe I'm not getting off yet. Spare me some change. Want my picture? You're French? Pleased to meet you, kid. - Where from? - Paris, rue des Pyrénées. I'm from Propriane. A Corsican! But I used to work in Paris. We're compatriots. Great! It won't be as bad as I thought. From Tegucigalpa? Could be. Give me the insight. I'm absolutely dead broke. Anything doing here? Try the saloon. Hernandez isn't a bad guy. Is it far? We'll take the taxi. It'll look better. The Corsario. Hello, Boss. I brought a pal along. I've got my hands full already. My word! But it's... A sight for sore eyes! Pay the taxi. Who is this guy? I thought he was your pal! - You know him? - I've heard of him. Come here, kid. Set one up for my pal, too. Sit down. Much obliged. Come off it. We're pals. You can call me Jo. But to the others, I'm Mr. Jo. Got it? Here's to you, Jo. It'll all work out. Don't worry. Not a bad joint. It gets tiring. Why did you pick this town? You can't always choose. I had to leave fast. I headed for the airport and bought a $50 ticket. That's why I'm here. That's Linda, a sweet kid. So I see. Say something. Be polite. She's sweet but she's half savage. I lost a button. Beat it! You know the type? They drop straight from the trees. Have you eaten? On the plane. The meal was included. I'll go have a bite. Why not here? I have a room in town. I like my independence. Of course. I won't be long. See? I didn't lose it. Of course. Were you mixing cement? I finished the framework. We got a new mixer. We may get a vibrator. Have you made anything? Say, did you strike gold or something? It's for a present. Pasta again? Take it easy. I'll make you a great sauce. There isn't time. I have an appointment. With a woman? No. With a man. A real man. - Drink. - Thank you. You're welcome. I'm thirsty. Got any money? My back wages? We'll see. Poor guy! Two beers outside. You sure eat fast! When I feel good. Thanks, kid. Have some brandy? It's the real stuff. - Great service. - I just helped myself. - Allow me my lord. - Easy, friend. Stop. I hate music. Sorry. Turn it off. It hurts our ears. You won't see us anymore. Out! Out! We won't come back here again. We'll go to The Palm Tree. And good riddance. A bunch of bellyachers! Not one of us here has a job. Only occasional odd jobs. Enough to eat and buy a drink. That's all. Why don't you clear out? I would if I could. We're not penned in. The trouble is... It takes too much effort. - Any trains? - None at all. - No highway? - It ends at the oil wells. Planes? The fare's too high. Caracas is too near. Besides, it's too hot. After that, it costs around $300. Got that much? Neither do I. And you need a visa. That can be arranged. A real one? A real one, too. That takes dough. So you need a job. And there are no jobs. They began that building two years ago. But they gave up. Too much sun. It's like prison here. Easy to get in... But no way out. - If you stay, you croak. - I don't want to croak. Nobody wants to. They croak anyway. Here's proof. He couldn't stand up. Because of the fever. Not only mosquitoes. But spiders, too. And bugs that eat your liver. And leprosy, too. You get spots on your wrists. But all that is nothing. There's only one bad sickness. Hunger . That's what kills most of us here. Not there. That's for Americans. Americans? Wherever there's oil, there's Americans. The SOC is their company. They've got a camp. They're organised. Houses, a canteen, a cemetery. All prefabricated. O'Brien checks up once a week. O'Brien? Bill O'Brien? A big guy? Know him? And how! We operated together in 1932. That changes everything! When I need dough, I get mean. You've got 900 miles of pipe-line. Pipe is fragile. A little dynamite... It makes a lot of noise. If the cops pin it on me, No go, eh? It's over, right? For the time being only. There must be dough somewhere. When the oil stops, everything stops. Look at that guy. They fired him. Look at him now. Do you mind? Who's he? That's my pal Luigi. A good guy. A good guy whom you've avoided lately. If you only knew how busy we've been. Let's swap jobs. We work with our brains. How's the job? So-so. The pay's lousy. He's greedy. He's always saving. I'm saving to go home. That guy doesn't seem to like conversation. See what I mean? A real plugger. We share a room. He does all the ironing and cooking. A terrific guy! A real dope! Why is he sore at me? It's only natural. Before you came, I saw a lot of him. He's mad now because I'm with you. What a idiot. What happened? Don't be afraid. Ugly beasts. Let's get a haircut. I just had one. Keep me company. It's Linda's day off. That changes things. Sure, sure. Are you angry? You're not that important. Wait for me, Jo. - Where are you going, Mario? - I'm going with Jo. See the pretty dress I made. It's this one. Isn't it exactly the same? If you wear it, you'll ruin it. I don't care. Yes or no? Lend him to me, Mr. Jo. Just one day a month. He's old enough to decide for himself. - I'm coming! - It's too late now. - Happy, now? - You can beat me. I feel like doing it. If we have to go, then let's go. Stop making faces! What'll I do? My visa expires in a month. I don't have the fare. $100 would save my life. Please help me. I'll pay you back. My family is honest. You're a decent man, too. Beat it. You're a pest. That'll teach you! Having fun? Boy, what a wet blanket! Women are a waste of time. It needs to go to the cleaner. What'll I wear? I'm too old to go bare-assed. Don't worry. You'll wear Luigi's pants. - Luigi's old man? - Not bad, eh? - Here. - Give it to me. You saw my museum? Those are my pin-ups. Something to think about, while boffing a black girl. And that's the treasure! The jewels of the crown. Take a look. I haven't seen one in ages. Pigalle. My last ticket. It took me to the train. And here I am. That was some ride! It used to cost a franc. But it costs $1,000 to get back. Fares have sure gone up. Make yourself right at home. My pants! I worked hard to buy them. What's he saying? Stop complaining. You'll get them back. Disinfected. Keep them. Give them to whoever you want. Cut it out. We're not married! I'm clearing out. - What does he want? - Let's go before I get sore. That's it, get out. I won't miss you. I told him off. Wait. I took this. - You know what? - What? - Luigi's coming here. - Really? I'll go tell the others. - This is going to be messy. - That's right. - Good evening, Pepito. - Good evening. Getting married? I'm treating the gang. It's on me, boys. Two whiskies. - Coming, Mr. Jo! - I ordered first. Sure. One lemonade for five? Lemonade? We're not broke! Champagne! Sparkling! - Real champagne, Luigi? - Of course. You're rich? Can I have a taste? I'd be delighted. Let's have some music. He's starting to annoy me. May I have the honour? With pleasure. Two for supper Two for supper Two for supper Waiter! We're thirsty! Coming. Well? The gentleman is served. What are you waiting for? I'm warning you. I don't brawl like a stevedore. I shoot. It's easy to strut with that! Here. Well, shoot! I can't, like that. How about like this? You look pale. A gun's not enough. You need guts. I'm not a murderer. How about our whiskey? - You had me worried. - That was nothing. Why did you slap him? That was just to add some spice. It's always we who suffer. It's always we who die. She's right. The foreigners never die. They kill your father. And they give you money! They killed my brother! And my husband! Francisco lost a leg. They paid you. Practically nothing! Is it a revolution? An accident at an oil well. Been burning all night. Thirteen victims, all from here. The mountain is on fire! You can see the flames! - Who's dead? - No news. We have a right to know. There they are! Good pay. Apply at the SOC office. On the corner of... It could work, with a little luck. We have to try it. Experienced drivers are needed for dangerous work. Very well paid. You hear that? $2,000 apiece. In a week, we'll be far away and rich! We'll think sometimes of Hernandez. He was great! I'd rather die right away than work! Swap with me Mario? Your truck for my wheelbarrow! It's a good job! Good for your health! I say, that sounds nasty. It's nothing, it's because I'm laughing. It sounds bad to me. Come and see me later. I don't need you, it'll go by itself. We can watch it go together. Come at siesta time. Cough. Take a deep breath. Your lungs are full of cement. Here and here... Carry on like this, you'll soon be dead. How long? A year, 6 months, maybe a little more. Maybe a little less. - What should I do? - Leave, right now. - How? - How, of course. Experienced drivers are needed. Dangerous work. Very good wages. How much do you pay? $2,000. How's it going? Who'd have thought there'd be so many candidates for suicide. They won't be driving trucks but coffins on wheels. They've a hope! None will return alive. Linda! What bit her? Give me one. You're there! Thank you, Holy Virgin. Don't go! Don't go with him. You'll die, they'll all die! I've got my visa, I'm a good driver! Those bastards... Who's next? If any one fools around, I'll grab him and smash his mug on one of the rods. I'll kill myself. It'll be on your conscience. I'll kill myself! And they're made of iron. That's one. You drove like a charm. You were way better. See, I told you so. What about me? What a lousy choice! Come on. No, you go on ahead. Don't worry. We'll manage. The show's over now. There's just the two of us. There's just the two of us. Bill and Joe. Let's have it out. Come on. I know you from way back. You know I can drive. So? You're too old, Jo. And so am I. We're played out. I don't feel old. - One of those guys'll back out. - We'll see. - You want to bet? - $2,000. If anyone backs out, the job's yours. That changes everything. "Dear Mom, I found work at last. "If you don't hear from me for a while, "don't worry. Love, Bernardo." To the millionaires! - Linda, listen... - Not now. Let him speak. It's very important. Tomorrow, post this letter for me. Have some guts. You'll get your turn. Don't cry, you're a man. You are, I'm not. Where the hell's Jo? He's upstairs, shut in his room. He can hide, his ploy worked. He's staying and you're going. One more hour. Go cry outside! An hour can be a long time. Hail Mary, full of grace the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us... poor sinners... Quickly! All of you, come quickly! Have you gone crazy? He's dead. He hung himself in the courtyard. Who, Jo? No, Bernardo, the little Italian. O'Brian's first victim. We sure look classy! Can't kick off without a uniform. Even when they guillotine you, they dress you up first. It's not like him to be late. No, that's not his style. I'll call the hotel just in case. Wait. Here he comes. Hello, boys! I came to see my pal off. What's going on? Looks like a funeral. Did you happen to see Smerloff? Isn't he here? Well, well. Who saw him last? He drank with us, and then left with Jo. We had things to talk about. You think it'll be okay? - What's wrong? - I'm scared. I'm scared I won't measure up. Don't worry, kid, I'm with you. Where's the stuff? Off to dinner. Stop drinking. It's bad for the reflexes. - Heads or tails? - Why? What's the difference! We're all going. Aw, there's no reason. Let's toss. - Tails. - Heads. - I always lose. - What a break! - Let's go. - Hold on. Not just yet. Not yet. I said. How much pressure? If anything goes wrong, I'm the one who'll get it. So, excuse me. Climb in, kid. Every minute costs dough. Turn on the lights. Headlights. On high. Searchlights. If you want to drive, go ahead. Otherwise, shut up. Jo, I brought you something. It's for you. - You're crazy. - Take it. - Won't you regret it? - It's no good any more. - Yes, pal. - Good luck! Didn't you fill the tank? The contact. It's okay now. That's it. Good luck. Coca-Cola. Some deal! He knows his stuff. Mario, darling, why are you doing this? I begged you not to. I'd have done anything for you, I'd have robbed, killed for you. You don't care if I'm unhappy. I hate you. I despise you. Careful! Bump on the right. Have pity, my love. That's enough. Now beat it! Goodbye, Mario, my love. Promise to be careful. Promise you'll come back. Beat it! - Made it this time. - We may not next time. Is it hot or cold? Rather hot. Why? I'm freezing. Want your sweater? Not now. Thanks, kid. Wipe my forehead. Something wrong? I think I'm sick. - Got a fever? - It's the chills. My malaria is coming back. A good start. Where are we? 200 yards past the turn. 3,000 times that distance. Say, do you smell oil? No, but the engine is hot from driving in second gear. Good. We'll let it cool off. - The truck is hot. - We have to be careful. It will be okay. Let's eat something. Already? We only drove a few kilometres. It's getting late. They're expecting us. Calm down. I don't give a damn. At the end of the year, they won't pay us dividends. - Jo, hurry up! - Are you nuts? Look! Rest later. Let's move! You hear? It must be nice to have money. Yesterday we were like them, like everyone else. We had fun, we slept, ate. We knew men and women. And now, there's nobody. - Just us two. - Two's enough. Enough to drive a truck, but... I like to be with people, to sit at the door, drink wine, talk. - About what ? - Whatever comes into my head. It's nice to get a girl into a corner. - Don't you like women? - No. You've had too easy a life. You think so? Yes, your dad spoiled you. What does he do? I'm an orphan. How old are you? - 100 years old. - You're kidding. You can turn 100 within a few months. Just be in the right place at the right time. Not even time for coffee. - Feeling sick again? - I don't like being rushed. - How do I hold it? - With your hands. What if we got a flat? With new tires? Stop kidding. It can happen. Should I throw it out? Hold it up for me. Here. Drink it down, Pop. Now what's wrong? Take the wheel. I told you not to eat! Did you break down? Someone's sick. Who's sick? Him? He's either drunk or scared. Say that to his face. We're talking to you, big shot! - Shut up! - Leave him alone! Don't worry. I don't want him. Only wake up and get going! We'll go when we're ready. We're not taking orders from you! Then keep driving. Let them go ahead if they want. You're supposed to keep ahead of us. You saw how they drive. If we follow, we'll creep like snails. Some drivers! A pair of lugs! When something happens to them, they'll be satisfied. Why? Is it bad up ahead? It's okay until the Little Coral. But then the road gets worse. Do you know what corrugated metal is? We cover houses with it. At home, yes. But here it means a bad road. The wind makes the road like an old pump. The vibrations can destroy the chassis. - The nitro can blow up. - Not if you go fast. At 40 miles, you fly over the bumps. But you must maintain the speed. Under 30 you get vibrations: The End! For how long? About 20 miles after Little Coral. This is the Coral. Here's the corrugated road. Here is the pump. Here the Americans put down concrete. Even there, you can't slow down. You wouldn't have time to accelerate. You must keep maximum speed all the time. We can do it slowly. You'll vibrate, man. To be safe, we shouldn't go over... I don't know... 6 miles. Okay. Let's go slowly. Are you nuts? Thirty kilometres will take at least 4 hours. After the bridge, accelerate up to 40 miles. 30. 35. 40. Here's the Coral. That's it. Let's hear the music. Don't move from it. You heard that? - It's not serious. - You're sure? - It isn't water in the gas tank? - Don't look for trouble. We're on the bad road. If it's the engine, we're screwed. - Time to go. - No. Let me finish my cigarette. - Finish it on the way. - I hate to smoke while driving. I can't taste it. Are you okay? Yes. - Not again! - Accelerate. Get a good start. - Can you see all right? - Yes. Use the Americans' concrete to slow down. If we get there. We won't get there, I'm telling you. The sign over there! We're getting close. Start accelerating, Jo. It's time. - Shouldn't we rather... - No, I told you. Twelve minutes if you go fast. - It must not blow up. - Knock on wood. My hands are full of it. Fourth gear! Keep the foot down! Speed up! Push it, man! Only 100 metres left. Go on, man! Do it! Step on the gas, for God's sake! Are you crazy? Now we're screwed! Why didn't you go? What happened? It's not my fault. It's the truck. It's a dud. It's not normal. A brand new truck should go fast. The speed might be limited. The Americans did it to save their merchandise. If it's true, they'll hear from me. That must be the reason. That must be the reason. We'll try again. - You found nothing? - Nothing. Back up. I'll check out something. Go on! Come, look here. If we turn here, we'll erase the tracks. So? - We'll back up on the tracks. - Are you nuts? Coming back you'll hit the ruts. If you're racing that spells trouble. No danger. Now guide me. If I had the bastard who filled it up! I bet he started to put in gas, oil. And when he realised it, he didn't say a word. Don't move. I'll find the guy. And I'll beat him up! Don't complain. This time you'll get clean gas. I'm thinking. We don't have room to speed up. Too bad, we'll finish slowly. What if the others are moving fast? They won't be able to stop. They'll ram us. Believe me, they are moving slowly. Otherwise, they would already be here. - I still want to put up a signal. - Go ahead, while I finish. Do you have a handkerchief? Too bad. It's brand new. At least, I used it once. Make up your mind! You're leaving the tracks. Okay. It's enough. Get in. - Maybe a hundred metres more... - Let's go. A few more metres and we're okay. We're okay. Ah, you brought it. Are you nuts? - Did you see them over there? - Who? Them. The Dutchman. I can't see that far away. Look. You're right. It's them. They're getting close. Speed up! - How far away are they? - 100 metres. 100 metres? We're moving fast. It's over. No, it's not over. Look. That silver point is the end of the road. Ten seconds and... Shut up! Three, four, Five, six, seven... Ten... Leave it! Thirteen, fourteen! Look, idiot! They're speeding up. That's it, Jo. We won. - It's lousy. - It's not pretty. They're widening the road. You won't get by. You'll have to maneuver. We'll have to go this way as far as possible, and then back up here, then shoot ahead. Back up, back up! There's room. Stop! The wood's rotten. Will it hold? Go ahead! Thanks, Luigi. It's nothing. Just need a good eye and... Look. My boy, we sure can say... It's a real rat trap! We have to warn the others. How will they manage? They'll manage! They should've stayed ahead! Hear that? It's them. How'd those guys get here! They used to cart three-ton hunks of iron. On these roads, it was suicide. - And our job isn't? - It's easier. - What does that mean? - Who cares! For me, the ride ends here. For you, too. How do you expect to maneuver here? You can't fly over this. Let's go back. Right now. It looks better here. We'll go out to the edge. The Wood's completely rotten! It's like sponge. - Have you flipped? - The others made it. Our truck is twice as heavy. You're drunk on nitro. Look at it. Slippery like a skating rink. You'll skid all over. Listen, Jo... There's $2,000 waiting. - I'd rather stay alive. - Too late to back out. When I was scared, you said: "Don't worry, kid, I'm with you." - We're going through. - It's madness. It was madness to ever accept. You got me into it. Get back and guide me. Poor sap. You'll get a medal. After you're dead. Take it easy! Okay, hold it. Hold it. I said to the edge. How much room is left? Dear God... Jo, answer! Don't kid around! What a spot! You louse! Don't bother to hide! I saw you. I saw you. Come back down. Wait for me, Mario! Get lost! Are you coming in or not? Scoundrel! Rat! Swine! I know, I know, you got the jitters. Big shot got the shakes! The holy terror! An Al Capone with cold feet! You and your malaria... You're scared stiff. You're a woman. If you'd been through what I've been through... Don't give me that! Maybe you were a man, in my grandma's time. Now all you can do is shoot guys in the back. - Because you hate risks. - That's because I know risks. But you, you just plunge in, recklessly. You have no imagination. I see every pebble and hole as a danger. I've died fifty times since last night. I see the explosion. I see myself blown to bits. I have brains in my head. If only you had some balls. Yours will be hanging from a tree. Like a pair of cherries. You want a drag? After tomorrow, I'll buy you one. We'll each smoke our own. Yeah, right. Bimba, why are you so sad? The past is over. After tomorrow, we'll be rich. If we're not dead. If we're dead, it's over. But if we're not, it'll be nice to get away. - Where to? - Anywhere. Away from the mosquitoes. There are enough here. Those back home are better. I'll go back to Calabria with the dough. I'll buy a house, and marry a pretty girl. With the dough. If you're scared, you can get out. This truck is not a rest home. I'm staying. I need to earn the dough. I'm earning it for you. I'm not Santa Claus. I do the work and you collect. $2,000, and then you beat it. It's no go. You'll earn it by driving. That's what you're paid for. You know why you're paid? You're paid to be soared! That's the division of labor. You drive and I die of fear. You're better off. That's all we needed. Too much! We're jinxed! Damn it! You lousy rock! How did you ever get here? It fell from up there. A landslide. Rotten stone! Lousy break. That finishes us! Wait. We'll use two crowbars. It weighs at least 50 tons. Well? We'll blow it up. With what? Don't we have enough back here? A whole can of nitro? A can? Why not a ton? One quart will do. But how'll you get it out? I'll siphon it off. Meanwhile, drill me a hole... A hole in the stone. About 30 inches deep. Deep enough? Okay, now get me the jack and the hammer. What are you playing at? - See? - He's blowing up the mountain. You're nuts! Have to clear the road. What do you think? Nothing. We want everyone's opinion, even yours. Who cares? Isn't it pretty risky? It might blow us all up. We'll back up the trucks. First yours, then ours. You heard? Hey, Chief, you heard? Okay. We'll back up. What's with him? The jitters. If you want him, I'll give him to you as a gift. Look at him. Get going, you! You're wrong. He's just a walking corpse. And so are we. Mario, carry the can as far as you can. Luigi, give me the thermos. Is there enough inside? - Maybe even too much. - Pretty clever. It's easy. I light the cord. When the flame reaches herb, the hammer falls, and boom! Get me a palm branch. Okay, now clear out. I'm in your way? First, the truck needs moving, and we shouldn't take unnecessary risks. Goodbye. Your cigar. Stop! It's good here. Sure, it's all nice and good. Come on! How is it back there? Okay. It's taking long. Take cover! The trucks! What if a stone hits them? - I'll back them up. - Too late! I'll extinguish the fuse. Come with us! It's safer! Get down, you dope! Is he dead? He's breathing! I can smell your feet! That's a good one. Are you hurt? Let me check. I thought you were dead. So did I. He was knocked down by the blast, that's all. So was the rock. Look! Not a bad job. Congratulations. I try my best. It's all gone. Did you see that? It's really twisted. You're twisted! It worked, so shut up. Let's water it! Time for a collective piss! You're preaching to the converted. I'm not invited? I'll piss alone. Careful, but don't shake. You are something! Mario has guts. I have less. Jo has none. But you take the cake. Did you ever work in a salt mine? The Nazis had me doing it for 3 years. I was half dead when I got out. Compared to that, what's nitroglycerine? Of course. But still... why shave? Listen, Luigi, before they hanged him, my father asked to take a shower. It's a bad habit my family has. I always wash my hands before eating. If I have to be a corpse, I'll be... a presentable one. You should eat. I don't have much appetite. But I'd like a cold drink in a Paris bistro. Want a smoke? Roll me one. Good old French shag... - You know that song? - No. But you're off key. Because my conscience is clear. - Luigi... - No more Luigi. When you ask for trouble it always comes. It could have been us. Poor guy. Forget it. They took a chance and lost. Your pal's pulverised and that's all you say? Talking won't help. Don't start! Are you crazy? Stop! Shut the door! I'm fed up. Drop that. Drop your stone. You first. It might not be right. Anyway I'm stronger. That saves time. Get up. Why are you so lousy to me? You don't know why? I need you. It's just us now. You'll stick with me until the end. Get to the truck. You're lucky I'm old! I'm washed up, a coward! Faster. What an explosion. Take a look. It's as if they fell in. The tracks go to the edge and stop. Odd. Like tracks of a plane that took off. That's what happened. They took off. - What happened to them? - How would I know? We'll never know. Even they didn't know. Not even deep. The level is rising. Even the pipe is broken. It'll be a full tank of petroleum. We get every possible lousy break! Bimba's cigarette holder. That's all that's left. Let's go. Otherwise we'll need a boat. Go see what the bottom's like. Test with your feet. I'll be right back. Who cares if it's two minutes or a year. Well? - It's slippery. - What? I said it's slippery. If you stop, you won't get started again. We'll have to go through. But don't stop! I'm following you. It's deep! Move! Hurry up! Wait. Wait. Stop! Get out of the way! I can't! I'm stuck! Move away! My leg! Couldn't you get out of the way? You knew you were running over me. But you went right ahead. I'm sorry but I had to. You're hurting me! You're hurting me! I told you to get away! If I hadn't hesitated. - You did? - Sure! If not, I'd have made it. Because of you, we're stuck. We're out of the running. We didn't even blow up. Stuck in the mud! A pair of heroes. Do something. You can't imagine. I don't have time. I'm in agony. You've been wanting to rest. Here's your chance. You win! Shut up! I've a fever. So does the truck, the metal's red hot. Remember what O'Brien said? At 80 degrees, it all vaporises. If I tell you how to get the truck out, you'll help me right away? When the truck's in the shade. You bastard! Do it by yourself! Don't fool around! You can be useful for once. You know a way? I'll kick you in the ribs! I won't feel it, I hurt too bad! Will you speak to me! Tell me, what's your trick? I'm thirsty. Tell me, you'll get a drink. Tell me! I'd talk if I were you. What's your trick? Just so you'll leave me in peace! You just have to fix 2 crowbars... in the axle... Right in the axle. Hurry! It's bad. - Stop shaking. - I'm not nytroglycerine. I'm not dangerous. Not any more. Doesn't it stink? It stinks. It's my leg. It's only the oil. I smell like a corpse. Stop raving. It's awful to feel yourself rotting. If you worry, you're licked. Look, my nails are purple. That's the end. You're not going to let yourself die, are you? That can't be helped. Talk to me, Jo. Say something. I want to sleep. No. Keep on fighting! I'm so tired. Never mind. Force yourself. - Talk to me. - What should we talk about? Anything you like. Where did you live in Paris? On the Rue Galande. No kidding! I know that street. Long ago. That's funny. Remember the tobacco shop at the corner? It's still there? Sure is. Next to the hardware store. In my time, there was a fence there. You're right. First, there's a fence. I never knew what was behind it. Nothing. Just an empty lot. - After the fence... - The hotel. No, the hardware store first. Yes, you're right. So, we were saying... The tobacco shop... - The fence... - The fence... The hotel... No, Jo, the hardware shop first! Yes, that's right. I'm trying to think... It's all confused. - It's worse? - I'm okay. It's such a long street. I'm out of breath. Jo, old pal. Hold on. We're almost there. You're sleeping? I'm trying to remember. What? The fence. What was behind the fence. There was nothing. Nothing. There's nothing! Look! We've won. Old pal... You're right. Take a little nap. Not like that. You scare me. Bad news. Luigi and Bimba were blown up, Jo is dead. - And Mario? - He'll be here in 2 hours. Here, in 2 hours? ls it really true? God be praised! Doc, did you hear? In 2 hours! .srt Extracted, Synced and Corrected by Dan4Jem, AD.XII.MMXVII
