...to provide the funds which are needed to meet the following national goals. First; I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth. Based on real events The Day Will Come Autumn, 1967 The journey to Gudbjerg was like a time machine. For every kilometer you came further and further back in time. You recognized it by the smell. In the silence and shadows on the superintendent's office. Take your clothes off and take that on. Erik Johansen. You are number 47. Elmer, you're number 30. Take your clothes off. Come on! Into bed. You must keep quiet. Is that understood? Sleep well. I cannot remember so much from the world outside of Gudbjerg. But I remember the brothers. - Erik? - No. Sleep. Elmer told me that he was thinking about... ...that there were other places worse than here. One could be hospitalized with an illness big as a zodiac. But that was before he knew anything about Gudbjerg. Stop them! Stop the thief! Stop them! Stop the thief! Stop the thief! - Elmer! Throw the package. - No. I can make it. - No you can't. - Yes I can. Hi! Stop! Stop! Come on, jump. - Stop! - Come on, Elmer! Jump! I'm very sorry. I'll talk to them. It is wrong, but it's little things. If it's freely exposed in the shop. Children's Welfare no longer believes that talking about it will help. The boys' school reports about skipping class. There are fights, absent-mindedness, stealing. I've been sick, but it's getting better now. How? You are a single parent. You can't pay your bills. You work shifts and study. How should I pay when I don't get paid the same as a man? I solder the same metal gadgets and must pay the same bills. Right now it is about the children's best interests. Next time you can't cope with the task, the state must do it for you. Do you understand what I'm saying? You're grounded for the rest of the month. Go to school everyday. My telescope is broken, and I will see the rocket tonight. After homework it's straight to bed. - You promised - It was your own fault, meat ball. - Stop! - He shall not call me meat ball! Why can't you just make some more money? Why can't I get pocket money? Out! The brothers' father hanged himself in a coke basement a few years earlier. So they only had their mother left. You look gorgeous. Elmer had clubfoot. For him, the solution to the problems was one day to go right up to the moon. I had never met their mother. But I can see her. When they made her laugh. It could well be that the journey was difficult. Oh! Honey. You just had to keep believing in it. You can't see anything. They'll never land. They can't land in the middle of a crater. They say there is only stone. It doesn't matter. It's bigger out there than you think. If one can go to the moon, anything can happen. - If you have the right suit on. - You will never be an astronaut. - Yes I will! - It's not possible with a clubfoot. - They haven't suits for someone like you. - You can't know that. Now I have to go to work. Elmer, you go to bed. Come on. Now you need to get some sleep, and then we read about that rocket in the newspaper. I'll see you when I wake up. If there's something important, call your uncle. Their mother never reached the factory that evening. She got ill in the bicycle basement, and crawled back to the apartment again. The disease had come over her. Their uncle said it was called cancer. - May we see her? - It's not a good time right now. - I want to see her. - You have to wait. Why can't I see her? If one read about cancer in a book, it said it was a Zodiac constellation in the Northern Hemisphere. Your sister can't possibly take care of the children. - I'm not talking about my sister. - We have looked at your request. You have no permanent home. Your latest income was three months ago. Sorry, you can't bring anything with you. - I'll take care of your binoculars. - But why can't we stay here? It's only until Christmas. You need to be big. Both of you. And you must take good care of each other. And you must behave yourselves and do as you're told. Will you promise me that? Come on, Elmer. They'll be fine. It's the best place in the country. Come on! Up! Ten minutes to breakfast. Even the prettier or smarter can't goof off. That goes for the two new ones, too. Come on! Sit there. Eat! I'm Erik. And this is my kid brother. Eat. He is coming soon. Our facilities are top notch. We take pride in being self-sufficient. In addition to schooling the boys help in the field, in the kitchen and in the workshops. - Good morning, boys! - Good morning, principal Heck. This is teacher Hammershøi, who takes over the teaching of Danish. - Please welcome her. - Good morning, teacher Hammershøi. That's good. Continue eating. Most of our boys need very basic learning. I do not demand miracles, but they must be able to read road signs and manuals and other easily accessible texts. They deserve to leave here with all the help they can get. - Let me show you the classroom. - Sorry. Hello. Where shall the new ones start? It depends on what they can. Where are they? Stand up. The Principal shall talk with you. Good morning. What are these villains' names? - Erik. - Elmer. What will you be when you grow up, Elmer? Astronaut. Come, come, come. Up again. Impertinence doesn't benefit anyone. Then we start afresh. Let them start in the field to drag stones to the dike. Miss Hammershøi. But he can't. Elmer's clubfoot always gets hurt if he has to carry heavy things. Well. It'll likely go. Now start in the field and we'll see if there should be a man in Elmer. From now on, speak only when the Principal asks you about something. - Enjoy your meal. - Thanks for the food! Here's the classroom. Besides teaching you will have responsibility for mail distribution, as well as helping in the infirmary with Mrs. Oskarson. - Any questions? - No. Are you really sure? Miss Hammershøi, with your background from good schools, including girls' schools, I'm sure you understand the need for discipline. Yes. You're probably aware that beating was abolished earlier this year? But Gudbjergs mission is more important than the frivolity in Copenhagen. The boys ended up here because no one else can control them. Yes. But every Gudbjerg boy may become a decent laborer. It's our duty to help them. Also if club five is the only language they understand. - Do you agree? - Thank you. I understand. I... don't use it myself. - But I understand. - Welcome. If you want to ask anything, my door is always open. Get your ass going! It goes for you too, fatty. Now there's lunch. - I came first. - Away, man. It'll get better after a few weeks. The blisters become calluses. One is ready when they ring the bell. - We shall only be here until Christmas. - I also said that two years ago. My name's Tøger. Those are Topper and Red. If you want to survive here, then you become a ghost. If you're a ghost, no one pays any attention to you. Do as you're told, you get your eternity note. - My eternity note? - When they let you out forever. At latest when you turn 15. Until then it is best to be invisible. Do you have anything for us? You pay for you and the cripple. Five cigarettes and one jam sandwich. - I'm not crip... - Be quiet when adults are talking. You don't have to give me anything. If you are an astronaut, you can just leave in the rocket. - Don't, dammit! - Come on! All the way up to the rocket! All the way up! The cripple also has fear of heights! Astronauts can't have fear of heights! Come on! Of course, the brothers ran off the first day. The shock of the place sits in the body. And one misses everything from where one came from. You can. Jump. Come here. The most important thing one learns when one runs away. Nobody wants to help a Gudbjerg boy. It was my idea. My little brother has nothing to do with it. - We just wanna go home. - This is your home now. Because no one else can take care of you. Of course it's difficult to understand. It's not nice to be discarded. Here at Gudbjerg you become part of a community. I give a shit. Just get finished. No, no. Understanding will be shown in a completely different way in this case. You haven't been taught how to behave! Field work for all throughout the night. Unless someone can come up with something else. Gudbjerg's spank. Gudbjerg's spank. Gudbjerg's spank. Gudbjerg's spank! Gudbjerg's spank! Here is a small gas burner to make the most necessary things. - What is happening? - It's just the new boys. The Principal will fix it. Stop! Here at Gudbjerg one becomes part of a community. If you don't respect the community, then it will punish you. Just as in the real world. Yes, get going. There's also a small refrigerator you can use. Gudbjerg's spank! Gudbjerg's spank! Gudbjerg's spank! If you will give the little one iodine and adhesive plaster, I will look for any sleepwear. It was also wrong to run away. One have to do what's being told. One must behave properly and one shall not lie and steal. Listen to what is being told. It's always appreciated and good things come in return. Thank you for today, good night and sleep well! Time goes fast. We scratch a line for every day we're here. Then we can keep an eye on how much time we have left. We must do as Tøger says. Try to be ghosts. - So they don't notice us. - I won't be a ghost. I want to be an astronaut. Neither astronauts know what they will face. They must handle everything. Shooting stars or earthquakes. Not earthquakes. They're mostly afraid of meeting space monsters or toxic gases, or for holes in the suit. We pretend that we are the ghosts. And keep quiet about all that astronaut stuff. Now it's lunch! The next few weeks the brothers tried to be ghosts. But it's not as easy as it sounds. You don't sleep in class. It does not get easier by having a club foot and wanting to be astronaut. I'll have to get you on to another job. You get cracks in the foot. That's why it hurts. That you can forget about. If one whines, it only becomes worse. Here. It was in the garbage, when I was looking for shutters. There's nothing wrong with it. Eat. Here. Here. - What are you doing? - Astronauts share. They may need each other's forces when they come up there. - How do you know they get up there? - They do. They started by sending a dog off. And then three monkeys. Now they will soon dare to send a man up there. - What about the dog and the apes? - Yes, they died. But they died out in space. Where you could see the moon and all the stars. It has meant a lot for them. Just wait. The day will come when we all can travel out to space. - Like going to the beach. - I've never been to the beach. Teacher Aksel is on duty! Thank you for today, good night and sleep well! Likewise, boys. Come on. - What are they doing? - It doesn't matter. - Just go to sleep. - I don't understand. Up! Ten minutes to breakfast. Come on! Up. Clothes on. Yes, you just get up. Your mother does not live here. Let it go a bit quick. Come on. - We have a new pee boy. - Ugh, hell! - You little bastard! - How disgusting. Practice! Practice! Practice! Hold it up higher. Higher up! - Little bastard! - How disgusting! Come on. Sit down. Will you sit down! You can arm yourself with patience. You have to stand here until it's dry. In place! Place. Good morning. When the boys are in the dining room, it is to eat. I'm sorry but there is a boy without clothes on. He must learn something. The boys are good with cleanliness. But we must set an example until the doctor gets a grip on it. - Go ahead to eat. - The doctor? Next time you have questions about the routines, let's take them outside, so the boys don't get confused. Problems with urination are not unusual for boys your age. Can you say "ah"? Jump on one leg. Jump on the other leg. Evidently normal growth except for a clubfoot. Does it hurt? However, fully functional. We begin with Truxal and amphetamines during the day. Then you are free of the problem. Next! Soon one could see that Elmer had been to the doctor. The price went up to seven shutters and two jam sandwiches because Elmer could now also write pee boy on his business card. In the evening he was put in the Blue Tower along with the other pee boys. He was so sedated by Truxal, that in the morning they had to give him amphetamine so he could wake up. It didn't work, although they increased his dose. Sit down at your place, and be quiet! Psycho-Toft even told him how much he costed to the state. Linens are to be washed, be cleaned, clothes put in place. Money that could have made your life comfortable. Every day Elmer stood in the yard with his bed sheet. Erik hoovered Gudbjerg for shutters to get the older ones to leave Elmer in peace. Don't. Astronauts don't piss in their suit. - No, but they get a rubber hose on. - Shut up with that shit. You will never be an astronaut. You don't know a damn thing about it. Why can't you just shut up and pull yourself together? - Here. - Thanks. They get a rubber hose on, too. It's sucked into space by itself. That's also correct. Sorry. - Fæ... - What's this letter? - It is a æ. - Fæ... - Yes? - Fæ... Færdig. No, do not guess. Do not guess. You shall spell. F-æ-l say "fæl", L-e-s say "les". Fæl... Wake up. One doesn't sleep in class. I can't keep saying that. One must learn to read and write. It's of most importance, if you want something out of your abilities. Have you written the words? May I see what you have written? You haven't written anything. - What's that? - Nothing. It's only something I've written. You haven't written this, Elmer. One shall behave properly. One mustn't lie. One shall not steal. Where did you copy it from? Elmer, where did you copy it from? Fine. Then read it. If you don't want to answer, then read it to the class. Read, please. Elmer to logbook. Day 23rd. The training goes well. I have read that you can get seasick of walking on the moon so it is good that the pee pills train me to be dizzy. Shh! It doesn't hurt so much anymore when they beat me. But I miss my spacesuit. I wonder how it is up there. When the feet leave the ground, and you just float. Ghosts also soar of course, but I will not be a ghost. It's not the same. I'll toss it out. That's fine. But you'll write the words on the blackboard five; no, ten times. Understand? It was Elmers luck that Miss Hammershøi saw him. She had pushed through that he was finished with pee pills. And because he could read well, she had to use him as a mail boy. Then the peeing ended. During test, cabin pressure got so high the cabin windows were shattered. Therefore informs space research insti... - Insti... - Institute. Institute NASA, that Apollo 5 will be delayed at least a month. - Fortunately, it's only a month. - Read something else than astronaut nonsense. What else is there? Negroes' life has improved. But it's not so well for the Vietnamese. There is also a lot about Christmas presents. But I know what I want. Such a telescope costs a lot of money. - What do your children wish? - I don't have children. Why not? I teach children. Now you have moved the pile. - I just sorted them. - Sorry. It just shouldn't be like that. I was close, a few years ago; and then... something went wrong. Then I got more time to teach. And it's also good, right? So. Now get out and deliver the letters. Teachers first, the students last. Maybe you just have to pay attention to the top. Also remember the others! Dear Elmer and Erik. I am still hospitalized and sleep much of the time. Treatment will be over soon and I feel much better now. Today I took a walk around with your uncle. He takes good care of the binoculars. And the doctor says I can come home for Christmas. - I look forward to hearing... - Elmer. You've read it three times. - How many days are left? - 17. Tøger? What shall you do for Christmas? The same as last year. It's a tradition. Hello, my boy. Soon it's Christmas. I've regrettable been sent abroad by the company again. I promise it will be the last time, and mail you your gift in time. All the best from your father. At Christmas he's unconscious from drinking. Unless he's not out for burglary. He could have written a few words about my sister. - Maybe he didn't have time. - Maybe he gave a shit. Wait! There's something more. PS. Your sister is well. - This morning she told of a dream. - Shut up with that shit. We were all on our way into space with the Apollo 5. Everywhere we could see stars. - We landed on an unknown planet. - Stop. Give me the letter. You and your sister jumped around like rubber balls and tried to catch the fireballs, which buzzed in the hands. Afterwards you used them as lamps, so you could find back to the rocket. Your sister became tired. But you took her on your shoulders and carried her all the way back. While she laughed and messed with your hair. We look forward to seeing you. But she the most. Many greetings from your father. Will you read mine? It wasn't long before everyone found out what Elmer was capable of. Most could chop through the text, but preferred that Elmer did it. We heard about the moon. Far out planets with strange names. And I think he enjoyed it as much as us. He read about zero gravity and space suits. And fights against slimy monsters you had to defeat on the way. For the first time we felt we were part of something bigger. Something outside of Gudbjerg. Something not to be forgotten. Just as one should not forget one should better be a ghost. Elmer. Elmer, you must wake up. Elmer, come. - You must wake up. - No. Wait. - I'll come along. - What are you thinking? Little pig! Lay down, damn it! Ugh, damn it! Now come. Come. You shall only read something for me. Yes. Elmer. I like you. I really like you. But if you don't do what I say, so... so then your brother will suffer. Elmer, stop it. Elmer, stop it! Leave! Leave! I found the post boy in the laundry room. It was a horrible sight. The boys tried first aid on him. I don't know what went on. We must find out. He's been assaulted, violated. It happens from time to time. The boys have a bad background. They are in puberty and they are experimenting. This wasn't an experiment. He can barely walk. He has been held and We can't rule out that he put up to it himself. There have been problems with his big brother? - It is not unthinkable. - It may be the boy's own fault? He won't say anything, so much looks like that. - I'll drive him to the hospital. - I've examined him. It is not so bad with him. He becomes healthy again. This must never ever happen again. Toft Lassen, you are responsible for keeping an eye on the boys. - They have not done well enough. - I hadn't the night shift. Then you must sit there every night until the boys have gotten the message. On to next point. The state supervision has announced that they are coming for inspection. - But - What do you want me to do? The boy won't say anything. Should we force it out of him? Should we take him to the hospital and start rumors? I wish it was different. We must ensure it doesn't happen again. The state supervision comes and must see Gudbjerg at its best. It's important that you tell what has happened. If you don't tell it, I can't help you. Elmer. Whoever has done it must be punished. It's not okay to do such a thing. - We're done now. May we go? - Elmer. Hear what I'm saying to you. If the boy is not being punished, he can do it again. Do you understand? It's your duty to tell who it was. - Otherwise, it'll affect... - It wasn't one of the boys. Erik? For the annual inspection Elmer was looking almost normal again. Mrs. Oskarson put make-up on the bruises. Stand straight, boys. In honor of the occasion we got on our Sunday clothes. - Your visits are so rare. - Yes. It looks fine. Not that the inspector noticed how we were dressed. Lunch is ready and warm. You can get the big tour afterwards. But it didn't matter. Erik and Elmer had only a few days left. It was almost as good as leaving yourself. - Appreciating to be here, boy? - Oh, yes. It's so much fun. Nice to hear. Yes, let's move on. So, boys. Sweep up the shavings. I'll help you, Elmer. Thank you. By the way... Look. It is for you. Here. Just take it. And remember this is our secret. And you know what? Elmer, you are a very, very special boy. Come. Help me with this. - You're happy to be here, right? - I am happy to teach. Miss Hammer found it hard to adapt, but now it's better. It's also a motley flock. As long as there are good people like you, we'll get those louts off the streets. - Rags! - Coming here. More rags! Rags! - Rags! - Coming here, coming here. - More! More! - I'll call an ambulance. The safety mechanism was turned off. Aksel must have forgotten it, or there was a fault on the machine. Send him my warmest greetings. Thank you for today, and Merry Christmas to all of you. Despite all. I just talked to the hospital. They can not say anything about how long he will be on sick leave. And they don't know yet if they can save his hand. Haven't I said I will have rest when we eat? A pity it did not happen to his balls. I said there shall be silence. Erik, come with me. There's a phone call. Perhaps Aksel ask's if we've found the rest. Shh! - Here you go. - Thank you. - Hello? It's Erik. - Hello, Erik. It is me. Hi uncle. When are we going home? Erik. Hello? Uncle, how's mother? They couldn't save her, Erik. They tried, but... But they couldn't. Erik, can you hear me? Erik. Say something, Erik. - What is it, Erik? - Quiet! - It was Uncle. - Shh! - He says that mother is... Be quiet and eat your food. - That's not right! - Be quiet. - That's not right! - Shh! - Quiet! - That's not right! Sit down and eat your food! That's not right! You've filled your plates. Then you eat it, too! Eat, damn it! Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! You heard what he said. Eat. Thank you for today, good night and sleep well! Where is she now? Erik? I don't know, Elmer. She's got to be somewhere. You can't just disappear. I'm sure she has come to heaven. And if she is in heaven she's well. It's likely as with the monkeys and the little dog. - The died, too. - Yes. But they were up there already. So they just hovered upwards. Maybe mom is already at the moon now. Perhaps heaven is just around there. So she soon sends for help. - Hello. - Hello. I am the uncle of two brothers who should be here. It's a pleasure you came. I'll get them. Uncle! Eventually they had to give her something so she passed away. They said it was the best for her. I have some cuttings for you, Elmer. - There are problems with Apollo 5. - So we're not going home? You'll be staying with me. I think we can take over the apartment. - When? - I don't know. Your mother wrote that I'm to take care of you. - I'm asking when? - Some months. Maximum half a year. Erik, it can not go faster. It's because of bureaucrats in the system. The Principal has written you're best off staying here. He claims you have caused trouble, but I'll get it resolved. - You've probably also found new friends. - We must get away from here now! If you won't help us, we must do it ourselves. Of course I will help you. Tell me what I shall do. They would run away that night. Their uncle was on something illegal. He wasn't afraid of a shit. The routine is important for the boys. They don't need unexpected visit. - I can see they are suffering. - Their mother has just died. Those boys are to go home as soon as possible. Excuse me, but home to what? - Can you take care of two boys? - That's none of your business. Your main occupation is being involved in the student committee at the university. - You will provide two boys with that? - No, I might not. Children are not something one chooses now and then to make riots. Rather, it is a matter of taking responsibility and making sure they don't get into trouble, that they don't lie and steal. Wander on the rooftops. You have to be there for them around the clock. In the most important period of their lives. Else it's not fair to them. If their uncle could have done it, he had brought them home now. But it was their own idea to wait until after sunset. Their uncle would pick them up and hide them until it was OK. - Hi, Elmer. - Hi. - Aren't you coming in? - Did I forget something? No. You just have not been here so much today. Sit down. It's the music from a film I read about. I don't understand it but it's written it is perfect to imagine how it's up in space. - It's absolutely quiet up there. - Well. But if one thinks that it's becoming too quiet. - It was nice. - No, perhaps a little... Well, at least now you know it's here. If you want to hear it again, you can just... Thanks. Elmer! It'll be OK. If one behaves properly, it will be appreciated and it comes in return. It'll take time, but your uncle is doing everything he can. So we have to trust that they'll solve it. Don't we? The orphanage Gudbjerg, it's Miss Hammershøi. - One moment. I was just to... - Good evening. I'll get the boys. - Wait. It's you I want to talk to. - Well. Yes. I do love the boys. They have always had a vivid imagination. Especially Elmer. It's hard to find out if what they say is right or wrong. I don't know. But I think you need to talk to them again. If you come up here, you can find out. Tell them that I'm sorry. - But I can't keep my promise. - What do you mean? Hello? What is it you have promised the boys? The children are in bed, and the light is off. I'll give Erik and Elmer a short message. - The light has been turned off. - It is important. - What is it about? - May I give them a brief message? If your message is so important that it can't wait until tomorrow then it is your duty to tell me about it now. Don't get angry. It's not the children's fault. They've just... lost their mother. I'm aware of their situation, so I will not be angry. Miss Hammershøi, what I do, I always do for the children's sake. Sit. Get the doctor to come tomorrow so they can go under treatment. You can't keep us here forever. When our uncle get's us home, we tell the police everything. But Erik, your uncle will not have you home. It was him who told us you would run away. - Let me talk to them. - That's not suitable. - You're lying as hell! - I never lie. For the sake of you and your brother, he agrees, it's best that you stay here. If you don't believe me, ask Miss Hammershøi. It was she who received his call. Come here. Stop. Come here! Come here. Come here! Come here! Down in the basement with him. - Relax! Your uncle was very upset. He loves you dearly, but he... He doesn't feel he's good enough to take care of you yet. I'm sure he'll come and visit you as soon as he... I had to tell it. There wasn't anyone to help you out there. - You're like the others. - No. Elmer I'm glad you never had children. It was good, it went amiss! Fine, the child should never be allowed to meet you! Sorry. Sorry. Elmer. Elmer. Elmers guardian angel left Gudbjerg early next morning. Hello. The brothers did not see her. They had become ghosts overnight. From now on only the superintendent and the eternity note could change that. Spacecraft Apollo 11 has now been ten days under way and is expected to land on the moon at 21 pm Danish time. Much is still uncertain, and a whole world holds it's breath. - Can't you turn it off? - Yes, of course. It looks great. Accounting is in order, and not a single remark. - How long has he administrated it? - Heck has been principal since 49. Since 62, he has been head of the Principal's Association. - He'll soon receive the Knight's Cross. - How nice. It sounds deserved. Our visit won't be popular. We haven't announced it. If all is as good as the report says, surely we may pay a visit. It's deserved. You should have received the Knight's Cross long time ago. Thank you, Mrs. Oskarson. The work is reward enough. It's very deserved. One has to get one's finest clothes. No, it's only the principal. What shall we do by the king? Congratulations once again. I'll see to a dress with it all. You'll be so attractive that even the king becomes jealous. Toft Lassen, get one of the boys to clean my car... - The Principal must come. - Not now. It's got to be now. There are only 2 toilets, cold water and 8 washbasins for the 47 boys. Yes, but you must talk to the principal about that. What happens here? Hello, my name is Gert Hartmann. I'm the new inspector. I've just joined the Department and has my inspection. We've not been informed. It must be another day. I understand your surprise, but inspections must not be reported in forehand. No, but why, however, show up unannounced? We want to show ourselves from our best side. We look forward to another day. I would not like to start my first meeting with Gudbjerg by writing to the Department that I have been rejected. No, of course not. Well, well, well. Inspect the buildings first, then we get us a good lunch. I would now like to talk to the kids first. - With the children? - It's them it is all about. They haven't had their bath. They are doing their chores in the fields. Then they'll probably just be happy for a short break. - What's your name? - Elmer. Are you OK, Elmer? - Well. Do you get enough to eat, boys? - We submit diet plans. Now it was the boys I asked. - How did you get this wound? - He fell from the hayloft. - How did you get this wound? - As the head master says. I's infected. He needs treatment. - Yes, we shall look at it. - I'll take care of it. How did you get the bulge in the forehead? I fell. But the principal helped me. Everything he does is for our own good. - Listen. - Listen! I'm here to control that you're treated well. I'm here for your sake. Want to tell me something in private, stretch one hand in the air. Anything your sorry about, whatever you can tell me. I promise I will help you. I want disease reports and description of routines submitted. Of course. We do this in advance. Each quarter. - If you looked in the protocols. - Thanks for today. Mrs. Oskarson, will you prepare a draft for a complaint? Back to work, boys. Three weeks till the school ended and then we would get our eternity note. So why say anything? - Have they said where you're going? - Not yet. But those without apprenticeship and family go to Rødemøllegård. They take siblings. So if the principal is satisfied with us, I'll ask if Elmer can come along. Completely under the edge. The principal want's it all cleaned. - Are you finished cleaning dirt? - Yes, sir headmaster. Come with me. You, too. The principal shall have a terrace. Soil must be raked off, gravel laid and tiles on. If there is even a tiny edge, you have to make it all over. - When shall it be finished? - This evening. If you can get your finger out, you can watch television with us. - What are looking at? - Television? The principal is in a giving mood. He has gotten a letter from the king. While he rejoices, the rest of us can watch the moon landing. Who cares about that? The principal's car is to be cleaned. - I'll do that. - Well. Yes. Come, boys. That was how we got to know. On July 20, 1969. Elmer had forgotten all about it. But it was good enough. Claus Toksvig, Houston has the latest news about the landing. I have what Armstrong said about the runway. It reads: "It looks good. Light shade." The moon ship's own shadow. "Okay. Stop the engine." Then came the official announcement: "Houston, Eagle has landed." Now we are waiting for the exciting moment when they will walk on the moon. That's nice, Erik. Really nice. It's approved. Come over to the others and watch television. There's one thing I'd like to ask the principal. Yes. I'll soon leave for a new place. Can my little brother come along? You're not going to a new place. I'll tell you one of these days. But I've turned 15. It should be a surprise. Don't say a word to the others. I extended Gudbjerg with an apprenticeship department. I'm so pleased with your progress, I reserved a place for you. Until you turn 18. I need someone who can be an example for others. It's a great opportunity for you. But remember, not one word to the others. I can't. - What do you mean by that? - You have to let me leave. Erik. Come along over to the others. I have done what you said. - I have done everything you've said! - Now no fuss, right? Erik. Armstrong's going out. On the ladder's second step, he can release the TV camera. We can see him coming down the ladder now. Before Armstrong's steps down, he'll try to step up again. He says it is possible. It's a big step up. Aldrin says he should not slam the door, so he can't get in. Now he steps out. It's one small step for man. One giant leap for mankind. The world's first man on the moon. Every TV broadcast is second to this one. These are facts. It happens on the moon at this moment. Erik! They did it! They did it! Erik? Come and see! Where are you? Erik? They beat him almost to death. After three days he had still not woken up. Even Mrs Oskarson was becoming worried. It didn't help that I got my eternity note. I had been waiting for it for four years, but it was not as I had expected. We had one week left. But there was no news about Erik. The Principal has asked that he gets complete tranquility. You can't go in to him. So. Now you've seen him. But he will recover? It is important that he gets complete tranquility. Go down and continue with the mail. The suits were beautiful. But the helmet, they could have made better. Most of the time they were inside the rocket. When they were outside, one could see everything. Here. You must drink something. You must drink something, otherwise one dies. Erik. Erik! The boy is really bad. He has a high fever and coughing blood. In addition to the other injuries, he must be sent to the hospital. - That's not an option. - He doesn't eat or drink. Then you must force it in him. Go on! Do something! The boy's one of the strongest I've had. You must get life in him! There's nothing more I can do. If it happens that he... then it's because what higher powers wishes. Not we. Yes? Just put the mail on the table. I will not be bored with questions about your brother. Go on with your duties. Had he been more like you, he wouldn't be sick right now. I would ask the Principal for a day's leave. Leave for what? You have no one you can visit, little Elmer. The Principal once said, perhaps I may be a postman. That's something I'd like to see. Postman is not a proper craftsmanship. There's so much else you could get much more use for. Mrs. Oskarson. See to that Elmer gets a return ticket to Copenhagen. Yes. But you have to be home before bedtime. And after all it's better than astronaut. Here you have for an ice cream. - Take care of yourself out there. - Thank you. Lillian Hammershøi. Elmer? Elmer? How nice you look. I don't teach kids anymore. I haven't done that since... Now I teach other teachers at the teacher's college. On the good days, I think I do things a little better. Where was it you wanted me to drive you? Are you visiting someone in here? Elmer, what is it? Stay over there. Excuse me, I want to talk to Inspector Hartmann. - Do you have an appointment? - No. The inspector is on inspection, but you're welcome to wait. Thank you. Here. - He's been waiting for hours. - The inspector is on inspection. - I don't know when he returns. - You must get in contact with him. This is vitally important. I hear what you say. But Hartmann doesn't reach back today. Elmers brother is seriously ill. He asks you to do something now. I'll file a report. - We have a departmental meeting next week. - Next week? I'm sure Gudbjerg takes good care of serious illness. There's nothing to criticise it for. No complaints from pupils and teachers. - It surely is. - And above all, no evidence. Do you have any evidence, boy? No, of course not, but he tells us... We can't believe in everything. I shall pass on a report. They are either employed or relative. Your behavior is inappropriate. Inappropriate? We've been waiting six hours for inspector Hartmann. - At least you could call him. - There is nothing more to say. But they said they would hurry. The secretary will contact the inspector. They're doing all they can. If not, I drive back there again tomorrow. I promise. Elmer, you must not give up. I know what I shall do now. What do you mean? Well? Elmer, what? What happened in Copenhagen? So we must do something ourselves. We must get Erik to the hospital. Only teacher Aksel is here. The rest celebrate some rubbish the Principal got from the king. We can get him back on the bicycle and drive him to the hospital. It's 25 km. They will find us before we get there. Meet me in the yard soon. I'll take care of teacher Aksel. Elmer! Elmer, what are you doing here? I thought the teacher would like a visit from me before the others are back. Well. That was... That was as thoughtful of you. But you know what? I don't want your company. You have become a sad look. Big and dirty. If I wash myself first. I see. Yes, so... So never mind then. But hurry. Hello, Elmer. Elmer? Elmer? Elmer! We celebrate Gudbjerg and not a single person. I'm just a tool. We are just tools in a larger context where it's all about doing the right thing for the boys. We can sometimes get to do things that doesn't feel right. Things that works. We must stay focused on the bigger picture and the fact the boys later in life will appreciate our modest efforts. And then there's one person who still needs to be emphasized. - You just said... - No rules without exceptions. Without this person Gudbjerg would not be the same. Without this person's loyalty and unrelenting hard with the boys none of us would be able to do our work. Mrs. Oskarson, thank you for your always good humour and your indomitable love for the boys. It didn't go well in Copenhagen. But now I know how they will believe in me. Then they take you away from here and get you healthy again. I'm not afraid anymore, Erik. Don't be sorry if I'm not there when you wake up. I've just left in advance. Just as mother. The astronauts didn't know what was there before they got there. And think what that meant. What the hell are you doing? Take that shit off! Go and get the principal. Have you gone crazy? He will kill you. Go and get him. Now! Long live! Elmer! Elmer! In two rows! In two rows! Stop that music. Have you become completely crazy, kid? - There is a phone call for the principal. - Not now! It's Andersen. Frederick, it's best if you go in and listen to what he has to say. - Hello? - Is it Heck? - Andersen from the Directorate. - Call another time. One of your boys have complained today. Call another time. He had clubfoot. He came with a former teacher. If you are a smart little cripple, you'll be lying still. Stop! Stop, dammit. I am aware of what you're up to now. I'll see to you're is so clean and nice when they come, it will not succeed. You two clean up. Get him in and get him patched so it can't be seen. Now. After him. After him! Stop, Elmer. Get down from there! Elmer. Elmer! Come here. Give me your hand. Give me the hand! Elmer Go to bed! There is no more to see! You have nothing to do here. Get in the car and get lost. We don't drive away before we have spoken to Elmer. What has she made you believe? Elmer is probably being put to bed. - You shall not interrupt that. - Elmer! Come here! Elmer, come here! Elmer! - Elmer! - Come on down! Elmer, come here with your hand! Elmer, no! The oldest gets fluids intravenously. He will be weak for a while, but he'll manage. Thanks. And... He must be made of something special. Concussion and broken collarbone. - But he can't fly. - No. They may go in to them. They will probably want to see their mother. I'm not their mother. Their mother is sadly... - Pardon. - I am just... You must have wondered when the boys got injured? I'm just a doctor. I was told that everything was in order. - I can not examine my employees. - Take it calm and easy. Be happy if you have a job when you return. Hello, Elmer. What can we help you with? - I would like to ask for our note. - Your note? Our eternity note. For me and my brother. You have to understand it was for your own good. You're going to look back on this with gratitude. Do you understand what I'm saying? Elmer? Say you understand what I'm saying. It's important. Come, Elmer. Now we're going home. Elmer, Elmer Elmer, you hear what I'm saying? It was the last time I saw Elmer. For the first time, I understood that there would be nothing at Gudbjerg, I would miss. Well. Listen. Are there any of you who will tell something in private? Kristensen, will you help me? Bye! This story is partly based in the Godhavn and other orphanages from the 60's. Many of their former students are now struggling with drug/alcohol addictions, depression and anxiety. Godhavn is run today as a Youth House, with the support of former students. We thank Arne Roel Jorgensen, Poul-Erik Rasmussen and other Godhavn boys. English subtitles: Jean Revision: Lukgenes
