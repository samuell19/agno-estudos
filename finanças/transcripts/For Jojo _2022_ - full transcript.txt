[couple moaning with pleasure] [distant chatter] [man laughing] [motorcycle engine roars] [distant laughter] [moaning continues] Can't you think of anything more exciting? - [clatter] - [Jojo giggles] - [man] You fucking crazy? - Hey, what the fuck? - How long have you been standing there? - Long enough to see how boring you are. [Jojo and Paula laugh] Cool. Okay. - Huh? - Nah, dude. You can go now. - [Paula sighs] - You sure? - [Paula] Yeah, now shut up. - [Jojo] Paula, come on. No, come on, I want you to myself. Sorry. [giggles] You need to go now. [Jojo laughs] Okay. Hey, I don't know if you think what you're doing here is cool, but it's not cool at all. - Poor guy. - [Jojo giggles] That's super awesome, single hipster nutjobs. Thanks, yeah. [Jojo and Paula laugh] [distant siren wailing] [door closes] [Jojo] Oh, man! [sighs] Was that necessary? Don't be so melodramatic. - Want me to get him back? - [Jojo laughs] No. [Paula] Come on, Jojo, can't you stay here, please? I need you. We've been best friends forever. I'll miss you so much. [Paula sighing] - Pauli, hurry up! - [Paula] Yeah. - Oh! - [Jojo] Paula? [Paula] Can you get my suitcase? [Jojo] Paula, come on! [Paula] Sorry. [Jojo] Paula, come on, come on! [Paula panting] [indistinct chatter] So... - Hey! - Sorry, I didn't mean to. Come on, cut it out. It's not me, it's the computer. Go stand over there! [man] Well, I'll get the food. You sit here. [Paula] Hey, look. Yeah, sure. It's Daniel. - Cut it out, please. I'm struggling here. - [Paula] Jojo, dude, it's him. [Jojo] "Him" who? The guy from back home. Oh, you're right! That's awesome. He doesn't look so bad now. Oh, well, sure, whatever. Hi. What are you two doing here? - Where are you flying to? - It's just me. I'm flying to Tulum, so... Me too. I'm also going to Tulum. - Really? - Yeah. What are you doing in Mexico? Sorry, nice seeing you, but Jojo and I were just saying goodbye, so... I'm working. What do you do? [Jojo] Nothing special. For a tour operator. - [Daniel] No, that's great. - [Jojo] And you? Um, I'm going there to surf. You should join me sometime. No, we have a "no surfer dude" rule. Yeah, but who cares? I'll join you anyway maybe. - [chuckles] - Cool. [Jojo] And what do you do? For work, right? - [Daniel chuckles] - Yeah. [Daniel] It's funny how people ask about work first. - Yeah, super funny. - In England, they talk about the weather. This is the shittiest conversation ever. You know that? [Jojo and Daniel laugh] - Shit. - [Jojo] Oh, shit, we have to go! - Can I help you? - No, I'm helping her. Thanks. - Bye, Pauli. - No, I'm coming with you. [Jojo] It's okay. [PA] The flight will depart at 16:55... Wait for me! [PA] Information on Eurowings flight 8054 to Cologne/Bonn. The flight will depart at 16:55... I love you. I love you more. [Jojo kissing loudly] Ciao. [beeps] Bye! [Jojo giggles] [melancholic music] [indistinct background chatter] [Paula snorts] [Paula] Tell me. [Jojo] I'm about to go surfing. - [Paula] With that guy? - [Jojo] Yeah. Hey, turns out we sat next to each other on the plane. Cool. [Jojo] We just chatted the whole time. His dad died. Do you remember him? That's a shame. Your parents are both dead. I think you're soulmates. Man, you're full of shit. Where does he live now, your surfer boy? He still lives there. [Paula] Ugh! In Shitsville, right? Oh, I knew it! He looks like that type of dude. He inherited the farm from his father, but he just sold it because he, um... It was too much for him. [Paula] Interesting. Um, on another note... On the subject of the rent... [Jojo] Oh, no, Paula. - No. - [Paula sighs] - [Jojo] Didn't you take care of it? - Sure. I did. In theory, I did take care of it. [Jojo] No, you didn't. Sure. I did. But, um, can you cover it for one more month? [Jojo sighs] - I'll figure it out then. - [Jojo] How? [telephone ringing] [child] Ah! [child giggles] [Paula sighs] [indistinct background chatter] Uh... Hello, job center? [child laughing] [indistinct chatter continues] [intercom chimes] NUMBER - ROOM TICKETS [woman and child giggling] [man] Ms. Peska, you know why we canceled your payments? Because you're assholes? You violated the application requirement several times. [Paula] They were shitty jobs. No, they were not. What are you living on right now? [Paula sighs] I'm living off my best friend. And so the job center is kind of like your best friend too? You studied law for six years for nothing. Only to fuck up your final exam. I do understand that you're, uh, lacking some motivation now. I probably would be too. [Paula] Hmm. [man] Uh, but that doesn't help. I don't know what I can do for you. Come to my place tonight? - I'm sorry? - Or do you have a girlfriend? You should bring her. Don't you want some further training? Maybe you could learn JavaScript. [printer whirring] [man sighs] Here are two jobs. Have a look at them and apply here. Cleaning lady? Really? - [man] The other one's at a bowling alley. - Huh? - [man] Maintenance. - Uh-huh. [siren wailing] [child shouts] [melancholic music] Come on, Jojo, can you maybe pick up when I call? I miss you. This really sucks. Stick your voicemail up your ass! I wanna see your face, man. Fuck you! [machine beeps] [machine rattling] [Paula sighs deeply] [footsteps] [distant dog barks] [horn blares] [Paula] I miss you. [Jojo] What? [Paula] Can you hear me? [Jojo] Hello? [Paula] I miss you! - [Jojo] Pauli! - [Paula] What are you doing? Jojo? Jojo? - Um, I can't hear... - [Daniel] Who is it? - Hold on. - [Daniel laughs] I can't hear you very well. Can you, um... Don't worry. We'll talk another time, okay? [Jojo] Let's talk later, yeah? [Paula sighs softly] [melancholic music] [Paula sobbing] [Paula moaning loudly] [Paula] Jojo, hi. [Jojo] Pauli. Um... I'm coming home. What, now? - [Jojo] Can you pick me up at the airport? - But... - Um... - [Jojo] I was fired. But is everything okay? [Jojo] Um, I can... I'll tell you when I get back, okay? I'll text you my flight details. Just tell me real quick. [Jojo] See you. [soft piano music] [Paula squeals excitedly] [horn blares] [Jojo] Pauli! Pauli! [Jojo shrieks] WELCOME HOME FROM PRISON I feel sick. I think I'm gonna throw up. [Jojo] There you are! Whoo! [Jojo chuckles] - [Jojo sighs] I missed you so much. - [Paula] Hi. Mornin'. Hi. [distant PA announcement] Can we, um, drop you off somewhere? No, I'm coming with you. [Jojo] Hmm. [Paula] So, what happened? Why are you back? Everything is so damn ugly here, right? - You ever noticed? - [Paula] No. [tires screech] - [horns blare] - [Jojo] Oh, dude! [horns beeping] [Jojo] What's wrong? Tell me what's going on. Come on, keep driving. No way. [horns blaring] What happened? Was your boss harassing you? I can't say. Why not? [inhales sharply] You've got cancer. - [Jojo] No. - [horns blaring] [Jojo] Come on, let's go get a beer. I don't want a beer. - [Jojo] You do. You always want a beer. - But not this time. That's a sign something's not right. Tell me what's going on. Don't say you're pregnant. I'll jump off the bridge. Please, just keep driving. [horn blares] - [Jojo] Go! - I don't give a shit. I'm staying here. [Jojo] Just drive. I can't tell you right now. I just can't, but... - Paula! - [horn beeps] Wait! You... Stop it! - Tell me what's going on. - No! - Will you cut it out if I do? - Yeah. - [Jojo] Get in and I'll tell you. - Okay. - [horn blares] - Paula, are you crazy? Get in the car! Stop fucking around! Hey! Okay. [sighs] We're getting married. - What? - Daniel and I are getting married. - So you're pregnant? - [Jojo] No. - [Paula] Then why get married? - I think he's great. He's an island boy. - No, he's not. - [Paula] Does he wear a Barbour jacket? Yeah, but ironically. Paula, get to know him. [Paula] Maybe you should get to know him first. - You have to marry him right away? - Yeah, because I want to. Because it feels right. Actually, that's not all. You're pregnant. Uh-uh. [Jojo inhales deeply] Oh God, I know what it is. You're going with him. Back to Shitsville. [Jojo] I want to be with him, and he doesn't want to move here. What about us?

[Daniel and Jojo laugh] [Paula sighs] Uh, we're going to a restaurant later. Wanna come? Janosch is coming too. Don't know him. Come on. No. I've suppressed all memories of this horrible island. He wanted to set you up, but I said it was a terrible idea. [sheep bleating] [Daniel] That's where I always used to cross the dunes. - [Jojo] Wow. - [Daniel] There was a beach behind there. [Jojo] Hmm! You don't have to look because of that? [Daniel] No. I'd rather look at you. - [Jojo] Hmm? - [Daniel] Mm-hmm. [chuckles] I don't know anyone who still has CDs. [Daniel] Neither do I. [Jojo and Daniel laugh] [rock music playing] [Daniel] There's Janosch. - [Janosch] So? - [Daniel] What's up? - Daniel's driving. You like danger? - [Jojo laughs] - You good? - You? - Hey. - Hey. [Daniel] You both remember my cousin? No. Take the road on the left. There was a traffic jam up there. [Daniel] All right, Mr. Navigator. Mr. Navigator. [Jojo] Well, how are you doing? [Janosch] Yeah, so far, so good. - [Daniel] Got everything done? - [Janosch] Yeah. And you two? Excited? - [Jojo] Yeah... - [Daniel] I am. [Janosch] Are you happy? [Daniel] Are we happy? [Jojo] Mm-hmm. [Janosch] Whoa! - Shit! - [Daniel and Jojo laugh] [rock music CD continues playing] [seagulls crying] [Jojo] Wow, look at that. That's so beautiful, isn't it? [Daniel] Remember our first time here, Janosch? That was awesome. Come on, we've seen everything now. We can go home. We found you a guy. So, shut up now. Yuck! Ugly. [Daniel] Maybe you. Not me, bro. You should've seen the waves in Mexico. - [Jojo] Wait! - You should've been there. - [Jojo] Hey. - Hey. - [Jojo giggles] - [Daniel] Here we are. [Jojo] Can you pass me the olives? Pass me the olives. [Janosch] Here, here. Dip, dip, dip. - [Jojo] This is awesome. - Want some? - That one's my favorite. - [Janosch] Kind of salty. [Jojo] Isn't it? Here, do you want some cutlery? Or are you eating with your fingers? Can you give me some bread? Thank you. Oh God! Are we really doing this? - Well, we can leave. - [Jojo] No. No, definitely not. [Jojo chuckles] [murmur of conversation] - Ever tried these? Super delicious. - No. Those are the last things I wanna try. - Okay. Want some? - [Jojo] Yeah. - Come on. - [Daniel] There you go. Oh, shit. Hmm? It's Dani's ex. Hi. Um... I... Your car was outside. Hi. I had no idea you were back. [Daniel] Um, yeah, for... for a few days now. Hi. Um, have a seat. Um, no, thanks. Dani, I'll go. Why didn't you let me know you were coming? Ellin... I'm sorry. - Okay. - [Daniel] Um... Sorry. [indistinct background chatter] Awkward. No, she wasn't awkward at all. [sighs] I'm pretty sure I haven't tried this one. I thought she looked really sad, actually. [Janosch clears throat] - How are things with you, Paula? - [Paula] Huh? - Yeah, what do you do? - Stuff. This and that. [Janosch] What does that mean? Well, you know, just stuff. No, tell us. - I... - [Jojo] Hmm? - Um... - Yeah? Hmm? Ever heard of boundaries? - [Janosch] Yeah. - He's just interested in you. Come on. Paula doesn't do anything. Hey. [Jojo] What? You started a degree, flunked your exam, and after that, nada. - Really, Johanna? - That's how it is. Admit it. - You can't get anything done. - [Paula] Well... When I think about it, we got some fun things done. For example, we once made a bet about hooking up with a different person every week for a year. - Paula! - So, like, 52 weeks, 52... Fifty-two men. People, you heteronormative island schmuck! You fucked 52 people in one year? - [Jojo] No, we didn't do it. - We did do it. Sure. - [Janosch laughs] Wow! - [Jojo] No, it wasn't like that. [Paula] It was. - [Janosch] What was it like? - Good. Really... [Jojo] It was nothing. - It was. - [Jojo] Uh-uh. - And, um, what kind of people were they? - [Paula] Good ones. - [Daniel] Hmm. - Good people. Wanna know who won the bet? - No. - [Daniel] I don't know. Of course. Do you realize how embarrassing this is? My phone's ringing. [seagulls crying] [Jojo] Paula! Paula! Paula! I'm on the phone. No, come on, that's my trick. What do you want? Hey, are you out of your mind or what? Why'd you bring that shit up? It was a great bet. In case you forgot, we had a lot of fun. Twenty years ago. - Two. - [Jojo] Paula! What about his ex? What ex? - [Paula] Come on, you're not stupid. - Yeah, what do you mean? You know. Something's still going on. Why are you doing this? - What? - [Jojo] Ruining it for me. Uh, sorry? My God. - How can I go in there now? - The same way you came out. Forget it. No, this is getting really pathetic. Can you just go now? Wow. Yeah. [seagulls continue crying] [melancholic ambient music] GERRYS GRILLCAFÉ HARBOR KIOSK [keys rattle in lock] [floor creaking] [Paula inhales and exhales deeply] [seagulls crying] - [boy] Huh? - [Paula gasps] - Dude, you scared me. - What are you doing here? Did you sleep here? Are those my clothes? - I'll be gone soon. - Where are you going? [Paula chuckles softly] You got big! Kids grow up. It's a miracle. When did you get cool? So, can I visit you now too? Sure. You can visit me anytime. I just had a lot to do. Hmm, all right. [indistinct chatter] When is Jojo's wedding? - [Paula sighs] It's not gonna happen. - [boy] Huh? Why not? She's out of her mind. Well, because it's all bullshit. [boy sighs] But isn't she your best friend? I bet you this wedding won't even happen. [boy] I don't get it. That's because your brain isn't fully developed yet. But maybe it'll happen still. Listen, you don't have a boyfriend or a hobby or something? Here. That's my boyfriend. [both laugh] You're absolutely crazy. I need to go now. - I'll take you. - [boy] No. Why not? Because I'm going with that guy. - That guy over there? - [boy] Yeah, that guy. - [Paula] Looks nice. - Yeah. [guy] Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - [Paula] Who are you? - Jeremy. Hi. This is my sister. She was just about to fuck off. - Yeah. - Oh, Basti told me a lot about you. - Really? - [Basti] That's not true. Yeah, but she believed it. [Basti and Jeremy laugh] [Jeremy] Well, uh, we have to go. Salut, sister. - She seemed nice. - Yeah? [Basti and Jeremy laugh] [soft music] [distant children shouting] [distant seagulls crying] [footsteps approaching] [door opens] [birds chirping] [Jojo] I asked you a straightforward question. - [Daniel] I heard you. - [Jojo] Did you? [Daniel] I said everything I had to say. Now, why don't you tell me more about that little bet of yours? How about that, huh? [Jojo] Come on, you're dodging my question. I mentioned it, so we don't need to talk about it now. I asked you a straightforward question. Why don't you answer? Leave those things alone for a moment. What is it with these avoidance tactics? [Jojo] You are the one avoiding stuff. That is what's happening. - It's not. - You don't have to pretend. - What do you mean? - I was sitting right next to you! [birds singing] [door opens] [footsteps] [Jojo] What are you doing here? I just came to get my things. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. Everything's great. What's he doing? [Jojo] He's going to work. [Paula groans] What kind of work? [clatter] I'm not really sure. [Paula] Ah... Okay. Do you guys talk sometimes, or do you just fuck? - At the moment, we just fuck. - [engine starts] [Jojo and Paula laugh] [car drives off] Sorry about yesterday. You do know I'm going ahead with this, right? [Paula] With what? Marriage. No. I don't think you'll marry him. What was that fight about earlier? [Jojo] Well, people fight sometimes. Paula, no bullshitting now. What will you do then? After the wedding? Fuck the wedding photographer? No, I mean after that. With me gone and you all alone. What am I supposed to do? Well, I don't know. Just get married first. Then we'll see. Okay, I have an idea. Let's go get you a wedding dress. Really? - [Paula] Yeah. - [Jojo] Are you being serious? Yeah, of course. If you think about it any longer, I'll change my mind. [Jojo chuckles] I love you! [kissing] [Paula and Jojo laughing] [shop door opens, bell rings] Hello. Hey. [jazz music playing] Too cute. Show me. Mm-hmm. [Jojo laughs] You look like a Karen! - Look, this is the one. - [Paula] That's the one. - Cheesy as hell! - Nice, simple. With these glasses. That's how I'd get married. Hey, babe. Oh God! [laughs] I love you. [Paula] I love you too. Kiss me. [Paula] I'll kiss you. [Jojo and Paula giggle] [Jojo] Oh! - [Paula] Mm-hmm. - So? - [Paula] Nice. - I'll try it on.

[Jojo whispering] Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Paula! Paula! Paula! Paula. Paula. Did you know? No. - You did. I can tell by your face. - I didn't. - Paula? - No, I really didn't. I want to get this off! Help me get this off! [Paula] Okay, okay. - Oh, it's sewn up at the back. - [Jojo] Hurry up! Here! - [dress rips] - [Paula] Wait... [both] Fuck!

What are you doing here? - [Jojo] Nothing. We were just leaving. - Right. You need to pay for this dress. Well, that, uh, that wasn't us, so... Yeah, I'm not an idiot. - [Paula exhales deeply] - [Ellin] Cash? Card? [zip opens] [paper rustling] You're a good fit for him. Two inconsiderate assholes have found each other. Thanks for shopping here. Have a nice day. [shop bell rings] [birds chirping] [wind gusting] [Jojo] Why did you take me there? What do you mean? Oh, Paula, come on, cut the bullshit. You were acting strange the whole time. No. Uh-uh. I thought what she said earlier was strange. [Paula sniffs] Yeah, it doesn't matter now. I'm going home. We haven't finished our drinks. I'm done for today. Can I drop you off somewhere? No, Jojo, come on. I'm sorry. Can't we talk about it? Thanks, but no. Can't you just stay with me for once? I just told you I'm going home. Why are you so angry all of a sudden? [engine starts] Wait a minute. [Jojo sighs] Just stop. - [Paula] Jojo! - Please get out! [Paula] Jojo, don't be so angry, okay?

Good to see you, brother. - This is Paula. - Hey. Hi. - Paula, you want a beer? - [Paula] Yeah. [dance music thumping] [man] Good to see you. [cheering] - You know what I mean? - Yeah, totally. [both laugh] [electronic dance music playing] [indistinct chatter] Hey. [music drowns out speech] Well, he's still arguing with a random guy in France who claims he was the first to surf, but that's not true. My grandpa was already surfing in 1952. He saw it on the news, people surfing on these weird boards in Hawaii. At the time, only the royal family could do it. He was a lifeguard, so he got a hold of a board and just went surfing. [sniffs] Do you like surfing? Honestly? [Janosch] Yeah. I think it's stupid. [Janosch laughs] How can you think it's stupid? I'm scared of the sea. You're from here. The sea is all around us. How are you scared of it? I don't know. You're funny. [Paula] How would you know? No idea. Aren't you? How do you know what someone's like before getting to know them? [Janosch sniffs] Intuition? [man shouts] [indistinct background chatter] - I think I'd better go back in. - [Paula] Now? [Janosch] Yeah. [Janosch sighs] Can I sleep at your place? I don't think so. Why not? No idea. Okay. [Janosch sniffs] Take care. [chatter continues in bar] [distant laughter] [birds singing] [Paula] Basti? [keys clatter on table] [Paula sighs] [distant seagulls crying] [Paula breathing softly] You again. [Paula] What time is it? Almost two. [Paula groans] I could sleep all the time. [Basti] Yeah, another form of denial. [Paula groans] [Basti] You look like shit too. Who was that guy the other day? That's none of your business. [Paula] Are you in love or something? Oh, he's just an exchange student. He'll be gone soon. I won't let my heart get broken. And you? I heard something was going on between you and Janosch. [Paula] No. I won't let my heart get broken either. So, are we both really clever or really dumb? - Come here. - [Basti sighs] [distant children shouting] - [Paula] What are you doing here? - I was looking for you. Cut the bullshit. Right in front of his ex's shop? [Jojo] We had a fight. [Paula] Who? [Jojo] The Pope and I. Come on, Paula. Why? [Jojo sighs] I asked him again about Ellin, and then... he suddenly got kind of weird, so I thought... I'd ask her. [Jojo sniffs] Ask her? [Jojo] I feel like shit. - That's a good idea. - [Jojo] No, it's a really shit idea. I feel like I cheated on him. I didn't even talk to her yet. What's really going on? I don't know. [Paula] Tell me. [Jojo inhales deeply] I've no idea. [Jojo sniffs] Everything has just changed since we got here. It's so serious. [ship's horn blows] What if we go visit your mom? Yeah. [birds crying] [wind gusting] [Jojo] We were lucky she hit a rock. Just imagine all that hassle with a bib and cleaning up the drool and all that shit. [Paula chuckles] Well done, Ulrike! [birds crying] Well done... Mama! [Jojo sniffs] Your mom jumped because she saw no other way out of her marriage. You do realize that, don't you? [Jojo sighs] Oh, Pauli. It's not as simple as that. [Jojo sniffs] [Paula] It's not? I know exactly what I want. Why are you crying, then? Because we had a fight. It's no big deal. [Paula] Who are you trying to fool? Tell me, can you only be happy when I feel like shit? Is that it? Jojo, you know that's not what this is about. I just want you to realize how... how shitty it actually is here. [seagulls crying] [Paula] Well done, Jojo! Jojo! Jojo! Jojo? Jojo! Jojo! [melancholic music] [Paula taps on window] ["Where's My Fun Parade?" by Natalie Sandtorv playing] [Janosch and Paula moaning with pleasure] [Paula] So, I guess I'll be off. Okay. [Paula] Um, was that it, then? What do you mean? [Paula] No idea. I don't know what I mean either. I'm sure you girls do this in Berlin all the time, don't you? [seagulls crying] Yeah. I guess so, yeah. [knife clatters on table] [Janosch inhales deeply] [Janosch and Paula sighing with pleasure] [Janosch breathing softly] Don't you want to come to bed? [Paula sighs] [Paula snickers] [Janosch groans] [waves crashing on shore] [ominous music] [Paula shrieks] [shop bell rings] Sorry. What are you doing here? I wanted to apologize. You already paid for the dress. It's okay. Yeah, but I'm sorry about our behavior. In theory, we're actually still together. What? [Ellin sighs] Charge! [Paula groans] Move in! [Ellin] Paula... Move in! [inaudible conversation] [Ellin] Paula, we shouldn't be here. Retreat. Retreat. Retreat! Ellin, what are you doing here? Hey, yo. Hey. Have you two been drinking? Nah, just an aperitif. A small one. Can we come in? - [Ellin] Can I come in too? - Please do, madam. Come right in! Jojo! [Jojo] Paula! Hey, we have so much to eat. Janosch brought a couple of bottles of wine too. - Come, I'll show you the fish! - [Paula] I need to talk to you. [Jojo] All right, wait a second, I just have to, um... What is it? I brought someone with me, so... [Jojo] I see. Cool. That's cool. Uh, who is it? Well, maybe you're gonna hate me now, but that's okay because maybe you won't hate me so much one day. What are you saying? Huh? [distant dog barking] Dani? Paula... Yeah. Mm-hmm. What are you doing here? I just told you I brought her. Uh, sure. [Janosch] Uh, do you girls want a drink? - No. - Yep, sure. Great. - Uh... - White wine? Uh-uh. Paula? Paula, can we go outside for a second? Yeah, but now's not such a good time. We have a guest. That'd be rude. Yeah. Uh... Hi, I'm Jojo. - Would you like a drink? - No, thanks. Yeah, sure. Just give her a glass of wine. No, I'll do it. Um... Here. There you go. Oh! - It's okay. I'll get something. - No, just leave it there. It's no problem. Tell me where the bucket is. - [Daniel] Leave it. - Are you his maid? - [Jojo] I said it's no problem. - Just leave it. It's okay. Just tell me where it is, please. Under the sink next to the trash bin! It's okay. I'll get it. Ellin, please, just stay... Just... Paula, can you tell me exactly why you brought her here, hmm? Johanna, can you chill for just five seconds? Uh, Jojo, I think we need to talk. - Talk to me? Yeah? - Yep. - Oh. - Yep. That was so obvious. Could you just shut up for once? What is it? [Daniel] It's, um, it's... [Ellin sighs] [Paula] No, Ellin, leave it. - Come on, Ellin, I'll do it. - I'll do it. - I can do it too. I said... - Leave it. - I'll do it. - I'm doing it! [Jojo] Okay. [glass clatters in bucket] [Jojo] Okay. Good. [chuckles] Well, then... Then, uh, let's all just sit down now. [Paula] Yeah, Ellin, where do you wanna sit? Daniel, what's going on here? I'm sorry. I wanted to talk to you, but, um... but not now. - Huh? What's going on here right now? - [Paula] Hey. What are you sorry about exactly? The fact that she's still your girlfriend? - [Daniel] What? That's not true. - [Ellin] When did you break up with me? I... I said I needed some space, so... [Ellin] When you two met, he was still with me. And when you two decided to get married, that whole time, he was still with me. - And when you... - Dude! When you go to fucking Mexico and say you need space, the message just... It's pretty clear. No. You wrote to me all the time. Is that true? Yeah, because I... um, because... 'cause you're important to me. [Jojo] Okay. Uh... That's, uh... That's interesting... too. [Daniel] And because I was worried about you, you know? I want you to be okay. I... don't want to hurt you. - So... - What the hell's going on right now? This isn't doing any good at all. [Daniel sighs] I was gonna tell you. Well, when? Tell me when? After this absurd wedding, or...? I don't understand why you're so angry. It... It has... It really has nothing to do with you. What, are you dumb? Listen, you have no right to interfere. - None at all. - [Paula] What? I'm not interfering. I'm just protecting her from fuckers like you! - I don't get what your fucking problem is! - Just leave her alone! No. [door slams] [car engine starts] [engine revving loudly] [Paula] Hey! [tires skid] [car door closes] [engine starts] [tires skid] [Jojo sniffs] [Jojo breathing heavily] [Jojo screams] [Jojo sobbing softly] What the hell is this? Your relationship was based on a pile of shit. - And I feel really bad for Ellin. - Excuse me? [vehicles approaching] I think you should be thanking me, actually. [Jojo] Why show me up like that, in front of everyone? You wouldn't listen otherwise. Come on, the guy's an asshole. Get that into your head for once! He doesn't need you. But I need you. [Jojo] Paula, you're absolutely nuts. Have you completely lost your mind? You're a psycho, Paula. A wreck! You're a completely deranged lunatic. Do you enjoy dragging others into your shit? Hmm? Do you get a kick out of that? What do you actually want? What are you doing here? Get a grip on your life and let me live mine! Stop interfering all the time, for the love of God! [indistinct background chatter] Do you need help? [Paula] No. I'm fine. Or maybe... Do you have a drink for me? [woman] Sure. - [Paula sighs] Where are you from? - [woman] Denmark. I'm Olli, and this is Freja. I'm Paula, and this is Karen Heiner. [Olli] Hey. Nice to meet you. Are you from here? Yes and no. You wanna get a drink with us? Actually, we were just about to take a tour on our quads. [Olli] Hey, maybe... maybe you can come with us? Hmm... Yeah. Why not? We love quads. Right, Karen Heiner? What the hell are quads? [quad engines roaring] [electronic dance music playing] [man] Nice. [dance music fades] [soft piano music] Let's go home tomorrow. I need you.
