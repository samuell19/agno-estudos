Everybody set? How do you do? My name is Dr. Victor Loeb In this modem, supersonic age it sometimes seems ...that we have lost our capacity to be amazed Science has rendered the miraculous commonplace and we have become smug in our dominion over nature itself.

My story begins on a day not so different from any other. lsuppose it could have happened anytime, to any woman. Looking back, I realize most of my days were smothered in routine. Safe, predictable routine that felt so much like a life All that was about to change Cobb Enterprises Sylvia? -Yes. lt's Mrs. Archer -Hi. l'm just calling to confirm dinner with my father. He has it on his calendar, Mrs. Archer. lreminded him when he left to meet with the Mayor. Good.

My father's good at explaining things I don't know what shines brighter you or that pendant. I remember making it for your mother l'm glad to see you wearing it She'd be pleased. Thankyou I better get back to the till -Bye, Mr. lngersol. Bye, Nancy I think l’ve got a pretty good handle on most of the things in my life. I know there are certain areas where l’m having problems. ladmit that, but l’m working on them and things can change People change When I confronted Harry he said he would stop... that he'd end the affair Have there been other affairs? -This is different. He loves me. He really does lt's not easy being married to the boss's daughter. That's whyl have to be patient, why it's important that I make life easier Easier for whom? Harry, my father What aboutyou? What about me? How about making life easier for yourself? -I have to go. The hour isn't up l'm having dinner with my father He's on a tight schedule he's expecting me. Do you ever get angry? Everybody gets angry What do you do when you get angry? What do you do when you get angry? What do you do when you get angry? Harry! You promised! He ain't here, Mrs. Archer That's his car Maybe he ran out of gas and he left it He doesn't care who knows Let's call it a night. Go home, have some coffee maybe l'm notdrunk You don't have to be drunk to drink coffee it's afree country. Tell him There is nobody here to tell, honest -Please, just tell him. Are you going to let a little thing like this ruin the whole night? There comes a point in a relationship when you realize what your prospects are We have plateaued at the motel level of things, Harry That is nowhere near good enough for Miss Parker's little girl, honey. You take this sort of thing too personal -You betl do. I have had a long time to figure out women like that Stupid, rich l’ve been painting their fingernails and washing their hair since I was 12 -Shit! Honey Why do you put up with it? Why do you make me put up with it? Just leave. Walk out She don't deserve you anyway l'm not leaving till I can take a big slice of old man Cobb's pie with me So? Community property. Dump her The old man made me sign a prenuptial Jesus! All we have to do is find the right angle and we're set. Every day I go into that office ...I find out where a couple more skeletons are buried. Just leave it up to Harry Harry's got a handle on everything You know what her real problem is? Nancy? Yeah, like you said she's spoiled and rich. Her real problem is she actually loves you There cheese on this dog? -You didn't ask for cheese. I don't ask for cheese cause I always get cheese on my dog lt's Mrs. Archer! -Didn't see Mr. Archer with her. Not unless she had him in the trunk Cheese, Charlie ls there a "P"? No "P l'd like to buy a vowel That's Mrs. Archer Hold the malted -Yes, sir. Jesus! This isjust so fucking romantic I could puke. Mrs. Archer, are you okay? What's the trouble? It was out there. It touched me It forced me off the road, and then touched me with alight What touched you? I want Harry. I want my husband Did someone try something out there? It was big, and it lit up the sky like a You've got to believe me It was there over the highway We believe you, it's just that Why don't you come sit in the squad car and tell us all about it? And we'll get you a nice big cup of coffee I don't want any coffee Why's everyone always trying to pour coffee into me? A woman has to have a limit If she don't have a limit, she is screwed from the get-go You shouldn't let things like that get to you, it causes wrinkles. lt's her -lt's not her. It is, it's her lt's her, with a gun and an axe and a bottle of acid. -Straighten up the bed, will ya? How stupid do you think people are? Mr. Archer, it's Deputy Spooner. Can I have a word with you, sir? Evening -Deputy. Hi, Honey -Charlie. Can I help you with something, Deputy? Yeah. I don't know if you heard, but we had some commotion out there Your wife had some trouble on the road -What kind of trouble? Spaceship -Spaceship? Ran her right off the road! At least, that's what she said Sheriff's taking her back out to look around You might wanna think about getting home... under the circumstances Thanks for the advice No charge 'Night, Honey. Night, Charlie Good-bye, Deputy Yeah. 'Night Nancy saw a spaceship Ran her off the road ls she crazy or something? People who see spaceships ...these are not the kind of people you want making important decisions decisions about money They need help You’re thinking something, aren't you? l'm thinking maybel should get home to my poor, unstable wife in her time of need. That's my girl Here See? This is where it forced me off the road I see the skid marks -But you don't believe me. Look at it from my point of view All I see are your tracks and nothin' else It never touched the ground You've got to believe me. I There! -What? There! Can't you see? Yeah, I can see it Why'd you call him? Part of the job -Sheriff. Mr. Cobb Get in the car, l'll drive you home I was trying to explain to the Sheriff- -Get into the car. Thanks for the call, Denby -Yes, sir. There won't be any tiresome paperwork about this little incident, will there? I think the young lady's upset enough as it is. Good night, Sheriff Good night, sir A spaceship? My God, why are you trying to destroy me? I saw it I cut short a meeting with the Mayor to have dinner with you. The Mayor Then I get a call from this female deputy Come get your hallucinating daughter Why can't you admit for one second thatl might be telling the truth? lt's your mother all over again -I saw something. You saw nothing! lwill not be made the laughingstock of this town What about the papers I signed yesterday? -Today there are more. Give the girl a break, Hamilton Nancy, you look tired. Why don't you toddle off to bed Yes, father Go on upstairs, baby. Your dad and I have some business to discuss. l'll be right up How'd your meeting go with the Mayor? l'll worry about the Mayor, you worry about keeping her in line And for God's sake ...can't you come up with anything more discreet than Tony's Shangri-la? I don't see where what I do is any of your business. I don't care if you cheat on your wife but I won't permit you to embarrass me especially not now... ...when l'm this close to getting the okay for the zoning switch. Make awish You’re cold Not that cold Why did you lie to me? You said you weren't going to see her anymore. That's what I was up there telling her I had to tell her, didn't I? I had to tell her face-to-face, didn't I? I don't know what l'd do ifl didn't have you. What happened? You got so involved in Daddy's business No, baby. I mean tonight. What happened out in the desert? I don't want to talk about it You'll think l'm crazy Why would I think a thing like that? I saw something in the sky Sheriff! -You seen anything? No. Nothing to report Hard Luck" Eddie. lt's "Hard Luck" Eddie Evening, Eddie What are you doing out this way, Denby? -Just doing myjob. You ain't got no claim out here This here's my mountain. You seen anything out here tonight? -Like what? -Like something unusual. This here's the desert, girlie girl What you call unusual don't mean much around here Did you see something or not? l’ve seen plenty. l’ve seen hailstones as big as your head l’ve seen lightning shoot out of the ground into the clouds. I heard stuff, too When the wind gets tangled up in them power lines... ...it makes the wires sing like a crazy woman in love Thirty years out here Ain't nothing unusual to me -Thanks a lot. Don't mention it, Sheriff Don't mention what? What do you figure she saw? Could have been some kid in a hot rod or ajet or helicopter from the air base I suppose it could have been something else. Like what? Like a spaceship? Suppose it was a real spaceship she saw A genuine flying saucer! I saw pictures of one in Life magazine all lit up like a Ferris wheel. Wouldn't that be something? A real spaceship landing right here Do you know what that'd mean? lsure do Overtime. A whole lot of overtime Who is it? Those glasses are new. I like them Principles of Accounting and Management? That's new, too. A girl's got to plan for the future -You don't have any future. You can take night courses from now till you stop being pretty... and you still won't have any future not with Harry Archer. Maybe that's not the wayl see it You don't see anything past the end of that beautiful little nosel paid-- Harry only wants what I want He doesn't have the imagination to want anything else. He doesn't love you, he hates me You talked to her like this, didn't you? Chipping away, making her feel smaller and smaller This is how you talked to your wife, and how you talk to your daughter, isn't it? lt's one thing to be smart _.it's another thing to be smart all the way around the block. You've still got a way to go ls there anything in particular you want? Yes. l’ve l'm anticipating some changes Once I take care of the Mayor and the boys on the council... things are going to move pretty quickly 0? So a word to the wise Don't get in the way What could I do? You? Nothing But Harry might try something He can't stop me, but he can interfere with me Tell him to keep his head down and his uninspired thoughts to himself Why don't you tell him yourself? I already have, but you get more of his attention than I do Anything else? I have an emergency set of tips to do Take care of him, and there might be a few bucks in it for you down the line Who knows? A word in the owner's ear, you could be promoted to the first chair Maybe I want more than first chair and a couple of lousy bucks. Don't want more than you got coming to you you'll end up with nothing at all I suppose it's all over town What is? Last night's fiasco What exactly happened last night? Do you like the garden? I try to keep it as nice as my mother did but it's hard. I don't know how she managed lt's a gift, I suppose. Harry told me you had an experience last night An experience is a nice generic term, accurate without any messy details. I like details Ask Harry or my father or the Sheriff l'm asking you lfl tell you, you'll just get the face The face? The "poor Nancy" face l’ve had just about as much of that as I can take. l'm a pretty good poker player Why don't you give it a try? I saw something in the sky A spaceship Yes? ls this how it started with my mother? -You’re not your mother. But is this how it started? I mean, seeing things, acting crazy? There's a big difference between acting crazy and being crazy Do you believe I saw something? Don't say that you believe I believel saw something. You call me on it when I try to squirm out of one of your questions Now it's your turn Do you believe me? €S Thoughtyou'd get away without seeing me? Nancy told you about her little close encounter? Just what do you want me to say? That she's insane because she saw a UFO that she's incompetent? Maybe it runs in the family Like mother, like daughter l'm late for a meeting I can't help thinking, under the circumstances ...it would be better if Nancy were to spend a little time, you know inside someplace I thought men like you vanished with the dinosaur and woolly mammoth but here you are, big as life. Amazing ls that a scientific opinion? lt's a very unscientific, very female opinion Excuse me Why'd you call Dr. Cushing? I thoughtyou mightwant to talk things out. lwas worried aboutyou You think l'm crazy You have to admit, that's quite a story -lt's true. Great You might want to think about getting away. Get some rest. -A sanitarium, like my mother. That might bejust what you need Whatl need is a little proof of whatl saw I wish I could make you go out there and see for yourself. And ifl don't see anything? What do you mean? We'll go out there to try to find this thing If we find it, or any part of it you'll get a public apology from me your father, the Sheriff, everyone. But... But? If we don't find anything, you promise to sign yourself up for a little supervised relaxation I saw something l'll drive Any particular search pattern in mind? Or you want to poke around until the Pacific Ocean? After town, we'll go into the hills then we'll take the long way home on the old country road. -And if we don't see anything? Then we'll do it all over again. lt's Mr. and Mrs. Archer You figure they patched things up? Getting late Am I supposed to just go quietly? Come on. l'll take you to dinner You want to stay out here with the scorpions all night? I don't know what went wrong, but What the hell's wrong with that thing? There! I told you Look at it! I see it lt's real! You didn't believe me! Nobody believed me, but it's real! -Shut up! You want it to see us? Who cares, as long as you see it? Wait until my father hears about this Shit! Help me! Don't leave me! Honey." Did your mother call you that? Or was it somebody else? Mrs. Archer? lt's a sweet name It suits you You must be very sweet to have such a sweet name You and I should talk We could have lunch Do you eat? How'd you get up here? lt's our secret Baggage Why do I always fall for guys with so much baggage? Come on. Let's get you some coffee Come on. Let's go You’re paranoid, old man. The stress is getting to you ls that the sort of line you've been feeding her? You’re an amateur. l’ve had a pretty good teacher Get out! l'm sorry, Doctor -She's resting. Yes, good. Resting She still doesn't remember what happened to her? No, but it'll come back to her -Itwill? That's how hysterical amnesia works It burns off a little at a time, like a fog And then she'll be able to tell us everything. Physically, she's all right but I want to talk to the doctor about her blood tests. ls something wrong? -I don't think so. But the hormone levels indicate that the tests were run improperly But she's all right, you said that She's not talking about seeing things ...or anything that would indicate she has any kind of, you know, problems Like a breakdown? Can you conceive of keeping your mouth shut for five minutes? You don't care about her condition As long as she can still sign your papers so you can keep the money moving. Dr. Cushing, could you please give me a ride back into town? Go back upstairs. You need your rest I need to get away from here. Everybody here thinks l'm crazy l'm not crazy Of course you're not, baby If you want to leave, l'll take you wherever you want to go l'm not letting you spirit her away ...before she tells us what you did to her in the desert Please! She's going to tell me everything that happened I don't remember anything -You see? Don't try to force her to lie for you -Please, don't fight. Don't worry. I can handle him Like you handled her mother? You really don't know when to shut up do you? You went through her money like itwas yours. You made her life so miserable there was nothing for her to do except kill herself! Stop it! Stay out of this! -Not now! Shutup! Don't you talk about my mother that way Don't talk about me that way! I am here! I am in this room! l'm a person! I am not a chair, or a What is it? -Get away from her! You get away from her! Gentlemen! Dr. Cushing, what's happening to me? Dr. Cushing, l'd like you to meet a colleague, Dr. Victor Loeb. Doctor I warned you about bringing in anyone from the outside. You may be able to see to her mental condition... but you're not qualified to look after her physical well-being. Dr. Loeb is Come with me, Doctor l'll just wait out here l'm afraid Harry wasn't very specific when he phoned. Just what is Mrs. Archer's condition? Unique Don't make any sudden moves l'd like you to meet Dr. Loeb He's here to help you. Dr. Loeb, l'd like you to meet Nancy Archer My God! Doctor? This is impossible That takes a load off my mind I thoughtl had a problem. Twenty-four hours ago, she was a normal-sized woman Note the hormone levels The levels are anomalous, but they couldn't accountfor that l'm not a "that"! Of course you're not I don't care what caused it, I just want someone to fix it We must get her to a controlled therapeutic environment I have a private clinic. lt's very secluded -That's why Harry-- A sanitarium? No, l'm staying here Mrs. Archer Nancy, don't you want the security? l'm staying here! Yes, I think home treatment would be less stressful for everyone Don't worry about money Anything you want, you can have Just ask my father. You were supposed to get her into your sanitarium. That's why I called you -She didn't want to go. You should have talked her into it Under the circumstances, any argument with Nancy would be very one-sided. What made her grow like that? You said she began to grow after becoming agitated. Clearly, it's stress-related The blood levels indicate some kind of hormonal imbalance Terrific, you've discovered a new kind of PMS. The situation is serious -You’re telling me? The human body wasn't designed to grow that large. l'm concerned about the strain You mean like on her heart. She could have a heart attack Try to understand Right now your wife has the blood pressure of an adult giraffe lt's all boilerplate. You don't have to look at them How am I supposed to sign these? -You don't have to. You use the paint to sign the cardboard Then I take your signature ...and I reduce it and put it on the documents l’ve spoken to the lawyers about it and they say under the circumstances it's essentially legal Blow them up -What? If they can reduce my signature, they can enlarge those contracts Get a billboard painter or something I want that fine print 6 feet tall. I simply will not have the details of my business pasted on the side of a barn for the world to see. Then find a new business, 'cause l'm not signing until I can read them You've had a long day l'm sure it's been very stressful Perhaps you ought to Perhaps you ought to go back in the I mean, go back in and rest I like being out here looking at the stars Of course you do. We all like the stars. They're very pretty But you have to take care of yourself You have to-- Father, l'm not a little girl No, you're not But you need your rest You have to protect your strength so the doctors can make you better You mean make me like I was before Yes, just as you were before lsn't that what we all want? l'll go back in the stable Good In a little while That'll be fine Good night, Father Good night, Nancy Jesus, she's big! I mean big! How'd she get so big? Something in that UFO bollixed up her hormones I cannot get over how big she is The doctors think being that size puts a strain on her heart. She gets dizzy Probably the altitude They think she might have a heart attack I doubt they'd be surprised if she keeled over like a mighty redwood A little stress, some anger some aggravation and, "Timber I don't know She looks pretty healthy to me Better than she did on that roof, poor thing. You think we could sell the carcass to Ringling Brothers? Maybe you shouldn't try to be so funny all the time Come and look at the stars with me Are you all right? I mean, do you feel okay, otherwise? My heart starts beating faster than normal Would you like to feel it? No, that's okay. l'll take your word for it The Doctor said it's all right, as long as I don't get too worked up That's an important thing to remember about not getting too worked up. Otherwise, I feel just fine Great. I guess l'll turn in Good night, Nancy. I was wondering about something Wondering aboutwhat? Aboutwhat would happen ifl told the Sheriff... how you took me out to the desert and simply left me there? What do you think people would make of that? That's not what happened Suppose that's whatl tell them happened? Suppose for once, people believe me instead of somebody else? You wouldn't do it I know you too well. You don't have the nerve Maybe l’ve changed Go inside Are you sure you're all right? -Go inside. And don't make any plans for dinner tomorrow night You and I have a lot to discuss Will your father bejoining you? He has a meeting with the town council Tonight's just for Harry and me. Do you want to make sure the truck is positioned where you want it? If it isn't, l'll move it myself, later -I suppose you could. The world is my dollhouse You seem to have made a certain adjustment to your condition l'm not saying the old Nancy still isn't in me. I can hear her inside, rattling around in the dark bumping into things, always apologizing But less and less Less and less They've all gone. Would you mind coming outside for a moment? l'm due for a stretch Due for a stretch! Can I give you a lift? No, thank you How can we grow as women if we can't trust each other? -Doctor, what are you doing? Doing? I am merely taking a.. So what's in this amazing colossal spike? Just avitamin soup with a mineral supplement chaser And? Doctor? Vitamins and minerals, as I said -And? And a very mild tranquilizer Valium? Or that stuff they use on racehorses? There's no need for this I disagree. The situation is difficult enough without running the risk of anxiety on her part. I have the husband's authority and the permission of her father What about my permission? lt's really for your own good You’re the one who looks like he's having a little anxiety, Dr. Loeb Maybe you need this more than me I don't like needles Nice try You ready? Ready O How'd I do? That's good! That's good Gun oil. I like the smell ofgun oil Yeah, it's a good smell My mamma hates it She doesn't think it's a ladylike aroma Of course, she's pretty much given up trying to make a lady out of me. She thinks law enforcement is un-feminine I tell her it's the onlyjob with any future in this stubby old town. Deputy, this stubby old town pays your salary. No disrespect A woman doesn't have too many options here, if you know whatl mean Yeah, I supposel do Sheriff? Have you ever been in love? l'm just curious Aboutwhat? About how it is with somebody like Mrs. Archer. Her and Mr. Archer, I mean Doesn't make sense to me That's 'cause it's none of your business -He isn't very nice to her. I just don't understand the way it is with women like that. Don't they know what they're getting into? Can't they see? lfigure it's like it is with old "Hard Luck" Eddie The old prospector who's here every month after he drinks up his government check? He's been going out to that desert for as long as I can remember. Looking for gold, looking for silver looking for uranium. Punching holes in those mountains till they whistle in a windstorm... and he always comes up empty Why does he do it? Cause if he stops looking ...he's got to explain to himself what he's been doing the last 30 years If he quits, he makes himself a fool for trying But so long as he keeps going at least he's got hope. Maybe the next claim will pay off, or the one after that. There comes a point when hope's all there is So you hold on long past the point when common sense tells you, you should let go. It can get that way with people, too You keep on giving and giving because they need so much, and then maybe if you give a little more they'll be satisfied. Maybe. ls that love? No, that's not love That's the thing people call love when they don't want to feel like they've wasted their lives. Welcome home Like the outfit? lt's something I have dinner waiting on the rooftop garden California chardonnay, not too pricey when you buy in bulk Cheers lsn't this romantic? You bet lt's a lovely night Yeah. A peach The stars seem so close close enough to touch. Close enough to hear you whisper When was the last time you and I sat down like this and had dinner? We've never sat down like this and had dinner. I mean in general. You and I, as a couple Lots of times We don't talk enough -We're talking now. No, I mean really talk This thing that's happened to me I think it could bring us closer together if we give it half a chance. Sure. What do you want to talk about? Have you ever thought much about Gulliver’s Travels? -A bo ut wh at? Gulliver’s Travels The book, Gulliver’s Travels? -That's right. I can't say as I have I have, quite a bit l’ve started to think of myself as Gulliver ...suddenly surrounded by all these toys and playthings And l’ve begun thinking about the possibilities. Exactly what possibilities are we talking about here? Adventure, new dimensions, new horizons Leave the manicurists and the cocktail waitresses down in the foothills... and look up You don't want to get rid of me Who said anything about getting rid of you? You don't want me in some sanitarium or a zoo Think about it You'd be the envy of every man alive There are pleasures waiting for you that no one has even dreamed of. Imagine, love on the scale of Gulliver You’re thinking about it. I can tell Are you crazy? You are crazy! What are you suggesting Jesus, this is sick! -Sick? Unnatural and sick and freakish! Who precisely are you calling a freak? You. l'm calling you an immense mistake and an enormous, pathetic freak l'm trying to share something with you l'm trying to save our marriage! By suggesting that you and I What did you expect me to do, get a wet suit and a flashlight? You son of a bitch! You were sad before, now you'rejust a big joke! If you knew half what Honey Parker knows about being a real woman .... Insect! Tick! I offer you a landscape and you cling to a glass doorknob Honey's better in bed than you ever were! She's even better than your cousin Vera! Vera? You slept with Vera? |'|| kill her But first l'm going to pop your head like a little Concord grape! Come on, baby Men Yes! Little past your curfew, isn't it? Thought l'd stop by and see how you're doin l'm doin' like l'm usually doin I got you a little surprise Such as? Look at this What happened? Timber The moon is shining bright along the Wabash "Through the hills, there comes a breath of new-mown hay "Through the sycamores, the candlelights are gleaming On the banks of the Wabash, far away Clarissa, listen to me Human beings are no better than they ought to be. ltwasjust an opinion Clarissa! You come back here this very instant, or l'll What's got into you? Damn animal. Animal! On the banks of the Bud Powell Not even close Okay, is everybody all right? Back in the desert .... Call the Army, the Air Force, somebody! -ls he on something? You have got to believe me! lt's her! She's coming! That's Mrs. Archer I can see that Where's my husband? 'Evening, Mrs. Archer. Good to see you up and about -Where's Harry? Don't you worry. We'll find him for you I know where he is. He's with that woman Stop! l'll stop when I find Harry. l'm just looking for a little closure Don't do this l’ve tried l’ve really tried to be all modern and adult and post-feminist and look what it's gotten me Now l'm taking matters into my own hands. What'll she do if she finds Harry? Ball him up like a used Kleenex Good All right. Everybody get into the squad car l'm going to call the National Guard and the State Police. This is not a good situation Yeah, baby? Tell me you love me -You knowl do. I know you do, but I want to hear you say it Gentlemen Congratulations -Well done. Excuse me -Certainly. Hamilton Cobb What? €S No. That isn't possible Hamilton, isn't that your little girl? For a dead woman, she sounds awful healthy Dead? She's not only alive, she's bigger Did you try to kill her with a grow light? -Shut up! Can't you do anything right? -What are you doing? Somebody around here's got to act like they've got balls Don't be stupid your whole damn life You’re better than they are, you're smarter than they are and you know more than you think We all do Miss me? I don't suppose you want to hear my side of this? What are they gonna do to them? -What do you think? Quick, maybe you can talk to her What's going to happen, sir? -Nothing. At least not until we're past city limits Then what, sir? I don't know, Quimby. ljust don't know All right, big woman. Now you got nowhere to go That’s far enough, ma’am Just put the hostage down and keep your hands up so we can see ’em Make me Doesn't seem right, firing an air-to-ground missile at a woman Don't think of her as a woman think of her as a target. That's what I always do Hold your fire until I give the signal Here, you talk to her -Me? You’re her father. Talk to her All right. lthink you’ve made your point. Stop embarrassing me in front of all these people! How dare you talk to me that way! lt's humiliating! You treat me like such a child! If you behaved like an adult, you’d be treated like an adult. Let’s keep family matters in the family. We’ll talk when we get home You don't care about me. You never cared about me You just need my name on some papers so you can hide more money. That's all you care about! You don't love me, you didn't love my mother And this town, all you're interested in is how much you can steal from it. You've got a gun. Why don't you do something? Like what, I suppose? Sheriff! Nobody fires until I say, "Fire Fire! What do you think you're doing? -You and I have to talk. Aboutwhat? About how we're going to be partners from now on. Equal partners Get out ofthe car You know, it's funny the things men will talk about in bed They'll talk about anything to keep from saying they love you They'll talk about work, and about money about substandard construction and bribes and kickbacks... when all a girl really wants to hear are those three little words. Now, what do you want? Start the car Dr. Cushing, what do you think actually happened here tonight? I don't know. I doubt we'll ever know But I think Nancy finally got Harry all to herself. I believe, if we were really going to be honest about this... we'd all admit to being victims ...ofavery unrealistic and limiting idea of manhood You’re right. That's where all the anger all the hostility comes from. We've been cut off from the old definitions of masculine and feminine. That causes the basic insecurity we all feel as men in the modern world You can see what l'm saying, can't you? Frankly, in my opinion, I don't know what you're talking about l'm not hostile, l'm not insecure ...and I don't have problems with my manhood, never did So whatever the trouble is, one thing I know for sure is it's not me But you can recognize the destructive patterns in your life and you're ready to change, right? The destructive patterns! Those destructive patterns can be a real bitch, right? Whatever you do, definitely avoid those destructive patterns I really wish you'd make an effort to participate These sessions are for your own good l'm participating. Didn't you just hear me participating? You just don't get it, do you? Why can't you understand? lt's notjust me that's changed it's a whole new universe. And it's up to you to catch up with us Maybe you'll figure it out Maybe. I hope so Otherwise Otherwise? Try again Again? Again Perhaps you'd like to share some of the personal experiences that broughtyou here. Mind your own business -You’re blocking. Keep your nose out of it, too, pal I think Harry has a lot of shame issues that he needs to work on. I think what Harry needs is a cold beer Maybe we should do that trust exercise That'd be a good way to show Harry how we all feel about him. Don't touch me! Don't ever touch me, understand? I really believe your putting down that chair ...would be a good way to start the healing process -Back off! I got him! Let go! Intervention is a sign of love Yeah? Well, intervene this!
