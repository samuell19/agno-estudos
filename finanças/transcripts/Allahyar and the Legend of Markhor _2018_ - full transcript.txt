A long time ago, there was a place considered unreachable to man. On top of a high mountain, an old sage was meditating. He had spent his entire life unraveling the mysteries of the universe. Despite gathering a lot of knowledge, he was worried about how he would preserve it for future generations. While he was lost in contemplation, a vicious snake slowly approached him. The sage did not like that, and because he could talk to animals, he demanded the snake to leave. The snake looked at him with an evil grin and attacked him. As the old sage was catching his breath, he thanked the majestic animal who saved him and appreciated its bravery. The majestic animal introduced itself as a markhor, a slayer of snakes. The sun soon shone over both of them as a mark of respect. And thus began a bond of friendship. The two spent a lot of time together and introduced each other to their worlds. Time went by quickly, and the sage soon realized that his time was going to be up. It was then that he finally found the answer to the question that had plagued him. The markhor approached his old friend and reminded him, "It's time." The sage stood up and made his way out of the cave for one last time. With the mountains as his witness, he proclaimed, "Oh, snow-capped peaks, bear witness, for I leave my knowledge in the hands of this markhor and the coming generations." The universe had accepted that whoever defeats his greatest fears while saving the life of a markhor, and possesses a pure heart will be known as the Protector. He shall be granted two incredible gifts. The ability to talk to animals, and the greatest gift of all, the accumulated knowledge of the sage. Not another word from any of you. No one's getting out of here alive unless they complete their homework. Sir? Shut up! That surprised me! Get back. Get back. Let me teach you a lesson. Darn dog! Help me. Help. Someone get me down. Help! What happened to you? Here you go, my little friend. Have some water. Hey, there! Where's that girlfriend of yours? Where do you think you're going? We are not done just yet. Watch out! I'll catch up with you later. Hello, Mr. Bablu. Buy vegetables! Buy carrots and tomatoes! What else did I miss? Oh, Allahyar's here. Allahyar? Allahyar? Allahyar! Are you all right? I'm fine. Mr. Bablu, can I have a pack of cookies? There you go. Thanks. Hey, what's going on over there? What is it? Mohsin spotted a leopard! No way! Rani! Super Hunter Allahyar is at your service! Guess what? That grumpy old man was very loud today. His spit flew everywhere. I got him good, though. He cried like a baby when he was hung upside down. You can't mess with Allahyar and get away with it. Crazy man! Rani, tomorrow is Independence Day. That means there is no class tomorrow! Yes! I'm going to put up the biggest flag. He got away. Darn this rat! This thief won't be as lucky next time. And that's not all, Rani. He stomped on the flower and pushed me. I'll deal with those three. They think they are really brave. Make sure she learns her lesson well. I'll quiz her later. Dad! -How are you, my son? -I'm all right. How was school? Same old stuff, nothing new. Really? So what happened to your teacher today? What happened to him? Allahyar. Believe me, Dad. I don't know what happened. Besides, you know that I only go after small mice, -not rhinos. -Have some shame. Don't disrespect your teachers. No, I was talking about rhinos, not my teacher. If you give respect, you'll get respect in return. Yes, but I... It won't happen again. Apologize to him tomorrow morning. All right? -But-- -Allahyar! As you say, Dad. You want to buy a flag when we return, right? Oh, yes! Dad! I made the most fantastic drawing today. Do you want to see it? Of course. Give me a second. Check this out. Very good, dear. These rockets here, they are inspired by the F-16. And here are its computers. I see. Very nice, dear. Look closely, it even has rocket boosters. Amazing. I know you don't like it. What? That isn't true. I'm just surprised at how amazing it is. I know you are saying that to make me feel good. No, really. It's amazing. Mind-blowing. What happened here? Nothing. Aren't we best friends? We are. Heroes stand their ground and never back down. Where there's a will... There's always a way. All right. It's time for work. But tomorrow's a holiday. Come on, take a day off. I cannot do that. I'm responsible for protecting the animals. You have to be honest in... ...your job. I know. All right, finish your homework. But it's a holiday tomorrow. You'll kill me with all this work. No need to be so dramatic, Allahyar. Go finish it. I hate homework! I'm leaving! I'm just a kid. Cut me some slack. Homework! I'm sick of it. Right, goodbye. What's wrong? Are you not enjoying the story? No. Not really. I thought this was your favorite story? It used to be when I was a little boy. -But I am no longer a little boy. -So are you a little girl, then? THE PROTECTOR STORY OF A HERO Dad. If you think about it, the story is pretty stupid. How will the Protector protect anything? And with such lame powers? Yes, but-- How is being able to talk to animals going to help him in a fight? -Oh, no-- -If he had money, gold, or a magical sword, it would have been fantastic. All right. Forget it, get some sleep. Although... the part with the dragon is pretty awesome. You know, Dad... You look just like the hero of the story. Just like... Shaan, the actor. Can you stop flattering me? What? Forget about that. Did you finish your homework? Yes. All right, go to sleep now. Say a prayer before you sleep. Good night. Good night, Dad. Dad. Don't close the door. All right, I won't. What are you doing here? Allahyar. Dad, look here. Someone left their goat. That isn't a goat. -It's a markhor. -A markhor? Dad, they are worth a lot, right? We can sell it and then we'll get a lot of money. This animal represents our country. Selling it would be like selling our country. This has to be the work of poachers. You're a good boy. Don't be scared. I'm your friend. -All right? -Just so you know, it's a girl. All right, give me a hand. Let's take her inside. Dad? Are hunters bad people? One should only hunt for food, and not for entertainment, adventure, or business. Let's go. You're a good girl. Don't be scared, everything will be fine. Dad? Wake up! Dad! What happened? Dad? Dad! Please wake up! Dad! Let me go! Dad! What's so funny? Bablu. Let me guess. You're thinking about the kid, aren't you? I... I know him. He's an innocent kid. Why didn't you tell me that you knew him? Go. Go on. Let him out and send him home. Why did you kidnap him in the first place? Go already. At this deserted place? Get back here! You will let him go? Are you mad? Try using that brain of yours! He knows you? Do you want to go to jail? Tell me, do you want to? His dad's a ranger and he knows you. Why didn't you finish him off? "I know him." What an idiot! He's just a kid. We can't kill him. Hey! You know what? Adopt the brat. What are you doing? Mani! What are you doing? Take the wheel! Mani! Take the wheel! Mani! Bablu, look! Thanks to this piece of meat, tomorrow, you and I will be rolling in cash. Look at that, it can already see its end. Are you scared? Tomorrow, a butcher will make minced meat out of you. And pretty soon, you'll be cooked and served on a platter! Are you dead? Are you dead or alive? Looks like the brat is dead, Bablu. All right. I'm just messing around. All right, listen up. Pick up the hunter from the airport tomorrow. We will be taking him on a hunt. Can you guess what we will hunt? The markhor with the biggest horns! We will earn American dollars, baby. Grab the keys. Lock them up in the storage room. I need to take a leak. Bablu! Get him! Bablu! Ouch, that hurts. -Allahyar. -No! My dear. Allahyar, listen to me. Where there's a will, there's always a way. Allahyar! Grab my hand. Hurry up! Get down there and get him. Why are you standing there? Do something! Come on! What else could you have done? You gave your all. It's not our fault that he wanted to take his own life. But Mani-- That poor kid was suicidal. It's a good thing that he is not here anymore. What? If a horse befriends grass, it will die from starvation! Look, in order to get rich, some sacrifices have to be made. Don't you want to roll in cash? Of course, I do! But not by crossing the line! There's a difference between hunting and murder! No, there isn't! That's what you don't understand. It's a life, be it a person or an animal. It's all the same. Prey is still prey. You're wrong, Mani. He was just an innocent kid. He had his entire life ahead of him. Wasn't that markhor a kid, too? Wasn't it? Tell me. There is no point in crying now, though. Mani? What are you doing? My dear friend... We can't let the Nawab leave hungry now, can we? That meat isn't going to walk back up. All right. That's enough! Dad. Okay, come here. Let's go home! Come. Hurry up. No! I won't. What do you mean? Why not? You're talking. So? What is it? The hunter? No, that goat... What's your problem? -You... -Me? -You're... -I'm Mehru. You're talking! Yes, so? You can talk? No! I'm mute. Did you hit your head? But... Wait, you can understand me? No way! I didn't know monkeys could talk. A monkey? Maybe I'm imagining this. My name is Mehru! The poor monkey might have hurt his head. Hey, you goat! I'm not a monkey! And I'm a markhor, you monkey! Same thing. Madam! You're going the wrong way! My home is this way. Sia Koh. And that's where I'll be going! By yourself? Of course! I'm a markhor. I don't need a monkey to protect me! Protect... The Protector! I'm the Protector! See? What? The Protector! The one who saves a markhor, has a pure heart, and conquers his fears will have the ability to talk to animals! He'll be known as the Protector, and that's me. Great, let's go. Where? To stop those hunters and protect the markhors! -Me? -Yes. I'm supposed to stop the hunters? But they have guns. If you are the Protector, and that hunter wants to hurt my father-- I get that. But my dad is a forest ranger, he'll get those hunters! So come with me. Fine. You keep making excuses, I'll be fine on my own. Wait! The hunters. And this wilderness... Don't worry. If you're too scared... I'm not scared. Don't cut me off. I can't let you go on your own! Because I am... Allahyar! The protector of the markhors! Shall we? Wait! Darn it! You know, if you want to go home... You can come back later with your dad. My dad. My dad. He always says that heroes never give up on a problem! My dad says the same thing. My dad is very brave. He's the clan leader. He's my best friend and I'm his favorite! But that's a secret! My sisters don't know that. If I had only listened to him, all this could have been avoided. But I went too far from home, and now that hunter knows where we live. That's it! I won't let him come near my family! Yes. Let's go. Where's the markhor? This seems to be the right way. Maybe you're right. But how would a monkey... I mean, a human. How would a human know anything about the jungle? It's probably this way. Of course, you're right. How would a human know about it? But I'm sure a wild animal knows! Monkeys are wild, too! Fine, then! Find a wild animal like yourself, and save your dad on your own! It's all right. Here. This is for you. Delicious! My love, where are you off to? My love... Your walk is so alluring. Your soft, scaly skin... It drives me wild. Oh, so wild! Your hair is as beautiful as that of an old woman. Eyes as... Sweetheart? Love? Love? Love? Did he see us? He did. Will you be my friend? If you can tell us the way to Sia Koh, we will both be your friend. Hey, monkey! I'd rather have my thumb be your friend! What? Mister... What? "Mister"? We're trying to stop a hunter. He's trying to kill my dad. And, we don't even know the way to Sia Koh! You look even more beautiful when you cry! I'll take you to Sia Koh myself. And I'll teach that hunter a lesson, so that he'll realize that you're under the protection of Hero, the mixed martial artist! -Look, mister. -Yes, miss? Allahyar! -Bye! -You don't need to worry, my love. You stupid owl! I'm Chakor, not an owl. If we follow this fool, it's game over. Let's calm down. I mean, why lie if you don't know? Just admit it! You can fly if you fall from the cliff, but what about her? Wait a minute! You can fly? Why don't you just fly over there and warn my family? Every dog and cat can fly. What? He got into a big fight with wild cats. So his hand broke! He can only walk. Hey! You bundle of lies! Where? My teacher told me that liars have tiny brains, but it looks like his is missing! Thanks for the offer, but I think we can manage. Sia Koh? I was talking about Sialkot! I've seen markhors there with my own eyes. A beautiful place, you know. Sia Koh is this way. -No! -Let's go. Stop! Forget it! Hero? Be my companion All these sights are only for you And these paths Will sing along with us There is no fear Nor any regret My courage has awakened I just want to keep moving forward We are travelers And the destination is still far ahead My friend Do not be afraid of such troubles Your day shall come tomorrow There is no fear Nor any regret My courage has awakened I just want to keep moving forward We are travelers And the destination is still far ahead My friend Do not be afraid of such troubles Your day shall come tomorrow A leaf. What's wrong? Nothing. Why do you want to kill us? Me? I mean humans. Being a hunter is considered an act of bravery. And one needs skill to be a marksman. It would be considered an act of bravery if we shot back. You can always practice on a rock. Am I right? Yes. Others do it for self-defense, while others hunt for food. Self-defense? Why? Are we the ones trying to kill them? No. But, what if a lion suddenly... Got hungry? Can't he be satisfied with fruits and vegetables? Well, yes. You have a point. Sia Koh. An unusual name, right? "Sia" means "black." "Koh" means "mountain." Black. Like the color, right? Then why not call it "Black Mountain"? You should not do that! Hero. Stop fooling around! Let's move! We've wasted enough time. What is it? We should get out of here. I agree. Wolves! Quiet! Boss! Boss. Can I eat him? Forget about him, look at what's behind him. A goat. Yes, she might look thin, but she is quite chubby. Hero! She isn't a goat. She's a markhor. You are a... -Let's not get personal here. -Markhor. Looks very tasty. Be quiet! Of course, whatever you say. All of you better be quiet. I must applaud your bravery for venturing out in this hostile environment. Finding food is difficult, but you came right to us. Absolutely, you said it! Actually, we were just about to head back. What did you think would happen? Oh, yes! What were you thinking? Stop interrupting me! How many times have I told you that when I'm... Just one word from me, and Daplu and Taplu will rip you apart. Boss, what is wrong with your voice? You pumpkin head! How many times do I have to say it? When I'm talking, do not interrupt me! I've got a sore throat. You guys made me howl... I did that all night long! Boss, our food! After them! Run! Forget it, boss. Salt raises our blood pressure, anyway. Boss. Can I eat him? Get him, boss! Get him! Teach him a lesson. Grab him by his tail. It's so dark, I can't see a thing. I'm really tired. Oh, really? Did you get tired of sitting? I'm tired. Stop, please. I'm tired. Eat something. Your bones are pricking me. Do you have bones or needles? What are you laughing at? Dumb monkey. He's gone blind. The tree was standing there, and the monkey went straight into it. What is it? Allahyar, get up! Hurry up! This is a dangerous animal! Have you all gone mad? How dare you say such things about me? Just wait and see. Do you even know who I am? I'm a snow leopard! I rule this land. I am your king and you are my servants! Crazy goat. Prepare yourself! See how Lord Chakku will deal with you! Does your mommy know where Lord Chakku is? If you have the guts, then bring it on. I'm not a goat, I'm a markhor! I know how to deal with your kind! You... You fat cow! Let's go. What kind of protector am I? Be careful, this kitten might scratch you. Hey, chicken. Who did you call a kitten? You're a scaredy-cat! Show me some respect, or else I'll eat you! Don't mess with me, understand? Isn't he cute? No? Get your eyes checked. You're calling this ugly beast "cute"? Right. He is really ugly. Don't waste my time. We need to get home before the hunter does. Stop! Tell me where you're going this instant! We're going to stop a hunter. -Mehru's dad-- -Allahyar. -What? -Be quiet! Draw him a map while you're at it, so it will be easier for him to hunt us. My friends are naive, they don't know about your kind. But I am a markhor! I know exactly how evil your kind is! If I see you again, you'll be screaming in agony! Understand? Poop. Roast wolf. Boss. Can I eat it? He's talking about you, idiot. Yes! You are an idiot. Boss? Watch your back, he might be a hunter. A hunter? Is he one of them? They are ruthless. Absolutely ruthless. Boss. I'm not scared, not at all. Don't let him escape. Wait! You will pay for this. Hunter. Did he fall for it? He took the bait. Anytime now. Now, I'll teach this beast a lesson for following us. "This beast"? Yes! He's a beast! Listen, you live in a fool's paradise. You know nothing about animals like him. I live in a fool's paradise? What I mean is, you are naive. Naive. It means you're stupid. The dumb kind. What were you thinking? That we wouldn't be aware of your conniving ways? How does it feel? The hunter has become the hunted! What are you going on about, you fat cow? I'll make you regret this! Fat? Yes, you're too fat for my taste. I'll hurt so bad, you will cry. The one who will be crying is you when you are left hanging here! Get me down this instant, or else you will face my wrath. Looks like the kitten is trying to scare you, Protector. Actually, the monkey is a coward. Listen, if you can find something else to hunt and stop following us, I'll let you go. I don't eat trash, don't flatter yourself. I'm following you so that I can get revenge on that hunter. Revenge? What for? Let me... He's horrible, he killed my parents and broke my leg! I won't forgive him! Who? The hunter, who else? He killed my parents, I'll have my revenge! He's a monster! Come. We're going to stop the hunter. -You can join us. -Allahyar! He cannot come with us! -But-- -No ifs or buts! Be reasonable, the enemy of our enemy-- No way! Let's go! No biting allowed. How are things going, my bubble gum? How have you been, buddy? No, I didn't make it. I'm calling you from the afterlife. Bablu! Ba... Oh, nothing. There are a few animals that want to be hunted, so yours truly decided to grant them their wish. On a serious note, bring the hunter with you tomorrow. I'll catch up. What do you mean "where"? Sia Koh, where else? To hunt the markhor. Goodbye. You think I'll let you leave me? Darling! Listen to me. No! Not another word. My love, you have to understand. Life here has become difficult. Mr. Ali Bunny Khan, you're probably cheating on me with a mouse, that's why you're running away. Not at all, sweetheart. It's not like that. I'll be able to get more food in the city. Really? Fine. I'm coming with you, -and so is my mother. -What? -Then what's the point? -What? Sweetheart. If you get more food, you'll become even fatter. -What-- -You called me fat? -No. -You called me fat? -No! I meant thinner. -Do I look fat to you? You know what? Being able to understand animals isn't actually a bad power. Oh, no! I'll starve to death. Here, eat up. It got a little spit on it. You heartless beast! Shame on you! That poor bunny. Chakku, wait! Do it like this. No, like this. Use your chest. No! From the tummy! What? There you go. That's it, I'm done. Come on, you're almost there. You just need a little practice. I'll go relieve myself. Relieve yourself. Gross. No one moves. Run! Hunter! Run! I have to admit, you've managed to train this goat to act like a dog. Don't touch her! You're going to hit me? Go ahead. Do it already! Even your father couldn't do anything against me, so you don't stand a chance. Don't you worry. I'll put you out of your misery, just like what I did to your pathetic father! Dad. I'm going to make you pay for this! The hunter! The hunter is here! Run! You're done for. Chakku. Allahyar... Where's that hunter? My... Dad! Sometimes you will face difficult times In your life Difficult times If you keep smiling The hard times will disappear If you keep smiling The hard times will disappear Keep smiling Every moment is a test You falter and you learn The world belongs to the brave No matter what the situation is No matter how rough the waters are Do not be discouraged and keep smiling Do not lead a life Conceding to hardships Never be sad Even if someone abandons you midway Do not be discouraged and keep smiling He won't come. You don't know what kind of animal he is. They are selfish and ungrateful. Trusting them-- You should never judge anyone by their race or religion. Such big words from a tiny mouth! I'm impressed. I learned it from my teacher. "Teacher"? Your teacher? Who is that? He sounds like a great man! Yes. He taught me a lot. Fine. Your teacher might be right. But look at how close we are to Sia Koh! If Chakku wants to come, he will. But I'm sure he won't. Oh, no! This won't work. Our time has come The sun will shine upon us like this When it drizzles for a moment or two We start looking for shelter Why should we complain When we are together on this journey? Our destination is far Let's go beyond these mountains My friend My friend My friend My friend My friend They left me behind! I'll have to walk because I can't fly. What a drag! Who is that? I better hide! Boss! The markhor, it went this way! Boss! Maybe the markhor flew this way because the ground doesn't have its scent. Hero is in big trouble. Let him catch up, then I'll teach him a lesson. Don't worry, he will come. Are you all right? Yes. I'm okay. Markhor. Where are you? Well, look who decided to show up. Hero, you... The hunter... He'll lead us right to him. Daplu. Taplu. Why, Boss? Mehru. Mehru! Mehru! Mehru! What is four threes? What? What is four threes? What is three fours? Cricket? Are you illiterate? What? No, I'm educated. I see... Can't you count? Count? Oh, math! I've studied it, but in English. So you're an Englishman? No, we're taught both. English and Urdu. So why don't you know math in Urdu? Well... -Actually-- -What are you doing here? I came to help a markhor. Her family is in danger. A group of hunters wants to kill them. And... I don't know how to get to Sia Koh. Oh, right. It's right there. So you intend to stop these hunters? Absolutely! I'm the Protector. That means I can talk to all animals. And that markhor... She is my friend. Hunting for sport is wrong! I lost all my companions, and now I'm alone. Now how will I stop the hunter by myself? But a protector never backs down! That hunter doesn't know who he's dealing with. He can't harm Mehru's family because I won't let them! So what are you still doing here? Sia Koh. Where there's a will... There's always a way. Stop right here. Here, take my photos. Should we leave? Where? We'll be walking from here. The terrain isn't suitable for a vehicle. So we'll walk a bit and climb a... Why didn't you tell me before? Buddy, my boots are expensive. They will be ruined. Let's go! Incompetent villagers. Allahyar! Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. How much longer? Who was that with Mr. Bablu? No idea. Maybe he's a friend of the hunter. They are headed towards Sia Koh! Don't worry. I've got a plan. And I know a shortcut! Are we there yet? Almost, sir. Let's sit for a moment. It's all your fault! Allahyar? Thank god! You're all right. Get us down, Allahyar. Mr. Bablu. I thought you were a good person. I considered you a friend. Thank you, Mr. Bablu, for teaching me this valuable lesson. Let's go. That was beautiful. The kid knows how to give a speech. And after multiple attempts... You're like an annoying fly, you keep coming back. Did you ever think about becoming a politician? Don't you agree, Bablu? Mani. Listen. Come, get me down. Is this some kind of joke? Quiet! Unfortunately, I'm an expert at killing flies. Mani, wait. Listen to me! What are you doing? Mani! Mani, don't! Don't do it, Mani! What are you doing? Chakku! Mani! Are you mad? Chakku? Chakku? Chakku, wake up! Chakku! Your teacher... Your teacher was right! Never judge someone by their race or religion. I always misunderstood him, yet he risked his life for us. Hey, you cow! -What are you saying? -Chakku! Will he be all right? Wonderful. All right, then. -Who is first on the list? -Mani. Mani, listen! Boss? Can I eat him? Go ahead. Mani, listen to me. -What are you doing? -Stop! Mani! Gross. He did it! Stop them! I know they can understand you. Look, okay? I give up! Please! I have given up. Bablu! It's not "Bablu." It's "Mr. Bablu." Mr. Bablu. Forgive me. I'm still your friend, and I always will be! Don't worry, Chakku! I'll visit you! Allahyar? Dad! Dad! I looked everywhere for you. Thank god, you're all right. Shall we go home? Mehru! Mehru! Mehru! My parents are waiting for me. Yes. My dad is waiting, too. Take care of yourself, monkey. Sweetheart, listen. Listen to me! Hero! I don't have time for you, monkey. Catch you later! My moon! Good to go? Oh, Dad? Did you know? I can talk to animals! Oh, really? Wow! Dad, I'm serious. It's true. I'm not a little boy anymore! So what are you? A little girl? Dad. Why are you scared of the night? When the night ends, the day begins Why do you cry because of a dream? We are made of these dreams Why do you look for your loved ones? They live in our hearts Why are you scared of failing? Failure paves the way to success Go ahead And lose Your ego Pour your heart out, my friend Say Allah, Allah, Allah Say Allahyar Say Allah, Allah, Allah Say Allahyar Rani! Oh, no!
