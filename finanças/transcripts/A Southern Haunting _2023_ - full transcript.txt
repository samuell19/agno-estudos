Still don't see why we can't plant cotton. - It's cause you know some don't make you slave to it. - Tobacco? - Watch strain backs. Shred fingers and we can stand tall. No. We're gonna stand on the tips of our toes as we reach for our peaches. - Peaches? - Advect It means no way to the rival. - Will these grow if I stick them in the ground? - No. - I wasn't asking you. - He's right, you need to see - well, guess I'll just show Mama where they're growing when she gets here. - Hey, we were reading that. - They're so pretty. - No they ain't. They don't make any sense. - They're art, they don't need to. - Then why did she draw them in there? - Because there's nowhere else to draw. - I wish I could draw as good as her. - Well you can't, now give it. - No. - Give it. - Elisha! - Damn it! You scared my deer, and I- - It had already heard your shot. - What did you say? - Look kid, hey now, he didn't mean nothing by it. - What's going on here? - Look no, wait. Look. - Why don't you run up and let the man talk? - Do not do this, alright? Abe, apologize. Apologize to the man. - Go on. - Let him go! - Look, just, we can just talk this out, okay? As long as you just let him go, I'll let y'all hunt here anytime. Ah! Lula, just put the rock down. These men are just here to shoot their deer Put the rock down. Go on. - Next time a dirty hand disrespects your family, you don't hesitate. Do you hear me? And as for all you, I bet they ain't even telling you why they generously this here piece of paradise. - It doesn't matter. It's ours now. - For now. - What he mean they ain't telling us everything? - Where'd you come from? Here. You sit on this and watch me. I will teach you how to make a bed. Somebody up here? - What's taking you so long? Henny, what did you do? -I don't know. I don't know. - I was standing right outside and nothing came in or out. - What's going on in here? - There was someone in the bed. It tried to get me. They were just... - Stop all this playing. - I ain't lying, Lula saw it. - Is this true? - No. - Lula, why are you saying... - Beds will be made before dinner. - What? - Why did you say that? - He wouldn't have believed us anyway. - Why are we hiding? - Hello! - We're not, now be quiet. - Then I'm gonna see what business they want. - Stay here. - Stay here. - Stay here. - For a while, we only thought we'd imagined hearing voices. I'm Tyron O'collen. This here is Fionagle or Fiona for short. We were just heading into town. We figured we could stop by. Well, it's not much but a bit of a welcome. - Looks good. - That's near an infection. Here. It's- whoa, hey. Easy. It's good. It'll help. Right. Well, we won't be a bother to you folks no more. Right. We found this on a path and nearly and run it over, I assumed it's yours? Are you all able to read that? I though that it was illegal for a... - Old man's eyes and word. House hands had to learn. - Mother always said the path of salvation, was found in those pages. - I fancy myself more of a man of science but I do enjoy a good fiction. In fact, I was user lead to teach Fiona English. Might have been a little too ambitious. Do you ever read any Turo Dickerson, Powell? - We were only allowed the Good Book. - Times certainly have changed but... - Just so you know, we don't need your handouts. - I'll tell you what , when you're through with them, You can give them back to me. Consider it a loan. Right. Well, that's it for us. If you need anything, we live just across the field. - Master always said it was his right to shoot any man on his land. -We count on them, we gonna have more problems than just this stubborn field. - You know the difference between a farm and a slave? - No sir. -One treats his land-- his seed, his tools with respect cause he knows it's the only thing keeping him alive. The other one just a tool. - You're not eating your bread. - What's that for? - Keeps the others out. - Sure it's not to keep us in? - Lula, don't say that. - No. He needs to accept that we are free and stop putting us in a new cage. - You speak like a goddamn child about things you don't know nothing about. - You're just scared. Her biggest mistake was trusting you. Maybe she'd be the one standing here if she hadn't listened to you. - Stop staring. - Eat your food. - What are you doing out there? Abe... Abe, come on. Let's go to bed. Come on. Let's go. - He's been like that for a while. - Why are you awake? - What are you wearing? - Abe, let's just go lie down. - He won't move. - Come on, don't wake father. Abe... - Henrietta, would you like some tea? Sure you do. One for you and one for me. Here, remember, pinky's up always. You have to have your pinky up when we drink tea. Very classy. - He wasn't upstairs? - No. And be careful with that, besides both of you are supposed to be reading. - Don't listen to her. She thinks she's everyone Mama but really, she's just your annoying auntie. - Which still makes me your older sister. So start reading. Abe, you out there? - Reading is stupid. This place is stupid. I wish we could just go back home. - Never call it that. - You said you hate it here. - N.othing in this house can do will ever make it as bad as that hell Abe! Where have you gone? - Lula - What's wrong with him? - Abe? - Come on. He's inside. - Warm water. Not too hot. Abe, can you hear me? - We need a doctor, not a baker. - I am a doctor or was studying to be one. - Why'd you stop? -Well, around here, no one wants a visit from an old colon. Doctor or not. - Do you know what's wrong with him? - Abe, can you hear me? Where did you say you found him? - Abe... - Are you okay? - Where were you? - Why isn't he moving? - Abe... Abe... If you're in there, hang on. It's Lula, right? Keep first to feed him, keep him strong and make sure it's small enough so that he doesn't choke, you got that? In the mean time, I'll head to town, see if I'll get some medicine. - We can't pay you for this visit, nor that medicine. I wasn't asking. - He gonna get better, and his crops gonna grow. People say it's a land and it ain't right. - There are rumors, sure, but that's not what's happening here. I went to school with a man who studies Earth and soil, I'm sure he could be of some help if he knows it's for me. - Your attention is required for an officer of these United States. - All lands declared on the 7th fifteenth shall enter into profit sharing. - The bureau decreed this? - Decreed or not, you all received these lands from the victims and those under grace. - Victims? How can you call them that? - Do not interrupt an officer of the United States. - Take it easy, lieutenant. Unless you got color blind you're wearing blue now. As I was saying, this land here hasn't been tilled for going on 3 years. As such, you've been granted an extension of one month. - And when is that? - 6 months from yesterday. - But we just got here 2 weeks ago. - And what will your harvest be? - Peaches. - In 6 months? - Cotton. We gonna grow cotton. - What did I tell you? I told you - They'll die before they even sprout. - Sour. - Abe, hand me that spoon. Hey, hand me the spoon. - Henny Hello? I'm talking to you. What's wrong? - I lost Henrietta. - Who? - It's my doll. - Ain't you too old to have a doll? - She was my friend. - What about me? - You're my sister. - Now, sisters can't be friends? - Were you Mama's friend? - No. I mean, she was our Mama. - See? Guess I'll never know if Mom and I could be friends. - So you're saying you know she's gone? - I'm just scared that Abe is gone too. - We're gonna get him through this. Okay? By taking care of us first. You understand? - Where's my son? Where are you hiding him? Where's my son? - Stop! You're hurting him. - Where's my son? What's happening here? Abe, I'm sorry. - Go on. - It looks like our old house. Tyron. Tyron. - Yeah. Could be a reaction to poison ivy or poison oak. I have something for him. You just... You grind it up and deliver it with water. Start off by giving him half of it cause you'd open half each day for 5 days. I know it's complicated, I wish there were an easier way. - You can measure it with a string and divide each day. - Hmm... Yeah. I think-- I think you might be smarter than me. That would work. - He's always figuring things like that out. - We all have our gifts and yours is currently for caring. - Henrietta! There you are. - What is that doing here? - Those are Fiona's things - Thanks so much for finding her. - Why don't you two go? - Okay. - And don't go further than I can see. - Come on Elisha, let's go. - Lula said not to run off. - Come on, don't be a baby. Let's go explore. - Why don't she speak English? Your sister? - Well, where I come from, that's how everyone speaks. There are, of course, those who are trying to erase it. - Is that why you came here? -That and an empty stomach. What's up? That necklace you keep playing with. - I found it along with a journal. - Journal? What did it say? - I can only read a few pages. Did you know her? The woman that lived in my house? - Well, the war begun shortly after we arrived and we never really shared the same views. - Come on, we should go. - What? No. - People thinks she cursed our land. - You know, I've heard what other people think my whole life. If we spent half the resources wasted on silly superstitions on Science, we couldn't. Who knows? Send a man to the moon - Now who's being silly? - Henny, Elisha, it's time to go. How far your land go? - Well you're looking at it. Your land actually surrounds us on 3 sides and then, the first and the other. - At least they can't take it away from you. Your friend, the one that knows about the soil... - I could ask but it's complicated. - What did I tell you two? - Sorry. - Thanks Tyron, for everything. - You awake? - That was you. - Elisha, you awake? - I'm awake. - So why ain't anyone sleeping? - Because you keep talking. - I don't like closing my eyes. - Yeah. I need to go to sleep. - Well whenever I sleep, I start hear her. - Who? - I don't like her either. - You both heard her? - Why didn't anyone wake me? What you gonna do with those? - We need more seed, not dresses. - They're here. - You should have asked the previous owner about the land before buying. - Well, people lie, you know? - So what about it? Can you fix the land? - Result like this wouldn't make sense being contained to just the top soil. - Are we hiding again? - Tyron says it has to be his land or his friend won't help us. - Father's gonna be so mad you gave away our farm. - Abe, do you know what's wrong with it? I promise to stop kicking you in my sleep if you come back. You can even have the whole blanket. I don't need it. And Henny found her doll It was... Abe, what are you- - Elijah, time to get ready for bed. - Abe, come on, come on. - I ain't even tired. - And I wasn't asking. - Elijah! - Can we just stay up until father gets back? - No. But the man really gonna help us? - I don't know. I don't want either of you two going near him if he does, understood? Elijah, enough. - Where is it? - What? - Mama's Bible. - Oh, you're in trouble? - But I wanted to show you something. - Bed, now. Come on. - Can you sing to us? - I don't sing. - Well you used to with Mama. - Only if you sing with me. - Tyron. - Under the bed, now. - But you just said- - Now! Help me with Abe. Go, go, go, go. - Couldn't fill the first but look. - You're right. Devil gone and kiss this land. You got any of your sister's bread? - Doctor's not here. - Who the hell are you? - He'll be back in a few hours. - That doesn't answer my question. Now I'll ask you again, who are you? - A friend Tyron's. We just passing through. - Friend? Are you getting cute with me? Maybe I'll just stay, wait so the doctor comes back and have a little conversation with about the company he's been keeping. What's wrong with him? - We don't know, that's why we brought him her.e Tyron's gonna fix him. - So it don't like there's much to fix. Since this is my friend's house, why don't you wait outside? - Why don't we both? - You're asking me to wait outside like a dog? Where's Fiona? I'm hungry. - She's with Tyron. - I thought I told you to wait outside and take the lame one. This here is not your home. - You're wrong. - Henny, stay in your room, please. Let me find Tyron and he can explain everything. - Find? If you get a man, it'd be on his own house. - He doesn't live here. - Where are you going? - I just wanted to tell you I believe you. A good doctor felt sorry and gave you this hair broken land to share crop. - We ain't no share croppers. - Any more of you? So you're saying this is your land? - It's more ours than any other.s - You know, a lot of my friends died because of you, and you, and you. Now, the government's just giving your their land before they're even cold. - Tyron was just trynna help us fix our land. - Your friend is always preaching. If I could just see beyond that bark skin get those stuff on the inside, I'd see. We're all the same. What do you say? Should we test the good doctor's theory out on this low one? - We asked you nicely to leave. - What are you gonna do with that? - Maybe cut you open? Prove we ain't nothing alike. You're just a gutless pig. Run outside. Find Tyron. - Now come on out. - Abe, Abe... - Where are you? - How did you do that? - Come on out. Enough games. I'm serious. - Wait no, Elijah, wait. Where are you going? Stop! - You can keep this cursed plot. - Elijah. - It's stuck. - This place is cursed. - What are you doing? Hey! - What else do we have to loose for you to understand this place ain't right? - You don't think there's greater evils outside these fences? - Mother feared nothing, maybe that's the real reason she left you! - She had fears. Her biggest one was loosing you. - Then there's nothing left to fight over. - Why you be wearing that? - You're right. She'll just come for this too. We don't belong here. - This all they gave you? For all those dresses? - They said they were stolen. - Well, that's a lie and they know it. He said it was kissed by the devil. - Devil ain't never kissed nothing. - Where are you-- Lula. I can't do this without you. His forty acres are his prison. Not mine. - What I'm I doing? Tyron! Fiona! Tyron! - Lula. - Tyron! - Oh, you're hurt. Look at this mess. Where's Fiona? - I haven't seen her in days. - You need a doctor. - I am a doctor. - Malachi thinks I own your land. What if anyone else knows you live here? Your family could be in danger tonight. Lula, there's something else, isn't there? - Elijah, he's dead - How? - Your friend, he came back. - I'll kill the man. - No. - I'll kill him. - Calm down, calm down. - I'm sorry. We need to contact the authorities. - So they can do more or the same? No. I'll figure it out on my own. - She's still not back? - Henny, you need to get some sleep. - Not without her. rying - Do you really think-- - Can you read it? - Yeah. It's just... There's something about it. A secret? She was the first to keep even from her husband and... And then he found out and he laid hands on her. And he just... He kept laying hands on her. - What was the secret? - It doesn't say. It just says that when the war begun, I prayed for it to take my husband. And it did. But that's not all, it also took my little girl. What? - Is that all it says? It says more? - Lula! Lula! Lula! - Hey, not now. We're keeping an eye out. Abe, stop. Come on Abe, please. - He's just scared of loosing you. - We lost each other years ago. - Lula... If you're not gonna leave my side, at least let me escort you home. We need to make sure your family is okay. - Here, Henrietta will protect you. Now, stay put until father gets back. And if Henrietta starts to-- Abe? Abe! Abe, this is no time for games. Abe! Abe? - Henny? Father? - Perhaps they're out looking for you. - Tyron? - What is it? - I don't know. - It makes no sense. - It's a puzzle. - You might be smarter than me. - He's always figuring things like that out. - He figured it out. - What does it mean? - It's a map. This was my mother's. - That was your mother's-- - She left years ago. She must have passed through here before. - How on Earth would your mother pass through this-- - Father said, if she ever left again to never come back and she never did. -No, I don't understand Lula. Lula... - She's gonna be so happy to see me. - Lula, Lula wait. - That's it. - Lula! Lula! - I don't see how any of this is gonna bring back your mother. - She marked this well on this land for a reason. If there's anything down there, a clue or another map to where she went after this, I have to see for myself. Wait, stop here. I can't move. - Everyone inside,. - Fiona? - We can't climb in these. - Mama. -You have to hide them. - The map, where is it? - Safe hands. - No Mama, you can't trust her. - Everyone, take my hand. - Tyron, thank God. - What are you doing here? Give me that. - I don't understand. - This her? - No. No. she's the help. It's not her. It's nothing. - It is shit like that when no one likes your kind. - Evening, lieutenant. - Evening. - Tyron, if you've finished cleaning the burner and feeding the hogs, I'll need your help with the uniforms for these fine fellas. -Oh no, no. We ain't here for uniforms - Do you want some coffee or tea then? - Okay. - Where are they? - I don't know who you mean. - They know the truth. - Check it. - Nothing. - Told you there's nothing there, alright? See? - Check again. - Tyron. - These people are my slaves. - Uh-huh... - These are my slaves. You can't take my slaves. - I'm disappointed in you. Hey, hey alright, find the others. - This wasn't part of the agreement. I gave you the station, you gave me the land. You never said anything about killing anyone. - Yeah, well this is war and people die. - He would never have told you it's a lie. They're not runaways, they're my slaves. These people are my property! Tyron! - And here I thought Tyron was your field bitch. - Be strong, our story is long ago. - I'm gonna cut you a deal, alright? You cut the rope of your master and I'll set you free. -You confuse freedom with being free, I will never cut that rope - Very well. Tyron, Tyron, go on. - No! No! - Take my hand. - This was a new shirt. I will require your services after all. - I don't know how far she could have gone. - And you just let her go? - You know how stubborn she can be. - What the hell is wrong with you? - Lula! - I'm ready. - I was worried sick. - Where's father? - He's with the children. - I need to see them. Just help me out. - I'm sorry. My hand slipped. Did you find anything interesting down there? - Tyron, what are you doing? - It's just I'm no fool all times. You see anything? - I told you I didn't see anything. - You saw her, didn't you? - Please? Just let me out. - I swore I had seen your eyes before but how is that possible? - Please just listen to me. - Of all the farms in the world, they had to give you mine. - Tyron, you can make this right. Together, we can fix this land - Cursed? Isn't that how you described it? - I'm coming. -I'm sorry Lula, but human beings are simply to selfish to share - Help! Help! Help! - But it's not any easier if I- - I'm so sorry. - Hey, it's okay. It's okay. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. I know everything is gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. - Mother, Tyron betrayed her. - I know. - Abe! Down here. - I never should have left him. He took the children. He took them. - No! No, they're hiding. - Where are they? - Henny? In here. This whole farm was mama's station before she was betrayed. She never stopped hiding. - Lula, get back. - She had to keep her promise to always come home, trust me. Why hasn't she taken me? I need her. I always needed her. - No, no, no You're strong. I trust you, you're strong enough to help keep this family together. Even when no one else could. Every time I look at you, I see the future in your eyes. Your mother saw it too. And now, it's your Mom who needs you. Go on, I trust you. I trust you. - Quickly, they're coming for us. - Henny? Abe? - Don't make a sound. I have to get the others. - No, we have to stop. - We leave at night, the next station is a. - No, you have to stop. - What are you-- How did you get this? - Mama, don't you see? It's me. - Lula! You've grown so much. But how? I've only been gone one week. - You've been gone a long time. - Where am I? - Home. You kept your promise. Mama, where's Henny? - They are coming for us. - No, they're not. And if we're gonna survive this, we have to have all of us. You need to return Abe and tell me where Henny is. Just take my hand. - No, Mama it's time to let go. - So strong. So beautiful. You promise, take their hand whenever they need. Be kind to your father. You are right, no more hiding. - Father! I'm in here. Father! - Lula? - Henny? Henny, you're okay. I found you. - You're okay. I wanna go home. - Do you know where we are? - Father! Father! Where are you? - Help! - Lula! - Henny, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. - Help me. Help me move that. We can do this. Go, go, go. - Everything's okay. - See father? - We got this. - What ya'll doing? We need to work. - Abe... - Abe, you're back. - They'll take care of each other over there. - You must live on your own, are you? - We picked our last name. - And what is it? - Henny Mothers. - Abraham Mothers. - Lula Mothers. - We're gonna grown peanuts 'till our peaches mature. - Well incase you ain't heard, your president has been shot - By decree of-- - It don't matter. Nothing this letter says can ever take away what we've done.
