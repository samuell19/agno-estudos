'Sudheesh, pass me that charger.' 'It's there in the bag, sir.' 'Okay, got it!' 'Shini sir, can you make me a black coffee?' 'What about others, Abhilash?' 'Binoy, do you want black coffee?' 'Hello... Thoppumpady police station...' 'Mini, do you want one?' 'Yes, one jeep has left from here.' '- Don't tell me later you also wanted one. - They are on duty.' 'Binoy, do you want one?' 'Sir, is there anyone in the bathroom?' 'Kurian sir is there inside.' 'There isn't any toilet cleaner left.' 'Clean it using a soap.' 'Super!' 'Rani, the bucket in the Sub Inspector's toilet is broken.' 'Please replace it.' 'Its rim has been chipped off. Does he eat it?' 'It's been there for some time now. Do you want coffee?' 'No, thanks. I had one from home.' 'Rani, I wanted to ask you something.' 'What?' 'Didn't you tell me about an astrologer in Kadavanthra the other day?' 'Nagesh Babu, right?' 'Can you get me his appointment?' 'I'm down on my luck.' 'My son fractured his leg last month while playing football.' 'My husband burned his leg from the bike silencer.' 'The blister has turned so big.' 'Everyone is injuring their legs.' 'Bad times!' 'Will Babu be able to help with it?' 'Of course. He's an expert at it, sir.' 'You would start flying once you wear the amulet given by him.' 'Okay, that's what I want.' 'Would it be okay to fly after two months?' 'Why so?' 'He slipped in the bathroom last week.' 'Heard that his foot got stuck in the closet.' 'He's in the hospital now.' 'Super! Doesn't he wear any amulet?' '-How will I know that? - Rani...' 'That bathroom floor is slippery. Please clean it.' 'We were talking about that only.' 'Sir, have you got a fever?' No, just body pain. 'I can prepare you a dry ginger coffee if you want.' No, thanks. It'd cause heartburn. 'Where are you heading to with the fever?' I need to handover a couple of summons. Sir... '-Where are you going? - To meet the inspector.' 'They built the building saying there is parking space for 5000 cars.' 'But what can the police do about it?' Who's it inside? Can I go in? - Good morning! - Good morning, sir. - What's it? - Summons. - Which one? - The Vellakka (baby coconut) case. Can't you just send it on WhatsApp? The Magistrate is a bit rigid. - Who's it? - Mr. Vinu. Oh! The one from Palakkad. Then you should definitely give it by hand. Is it just Saudi? No, other places are also there. Their addresses have changed. Have you submitted the report of the other case at the court? Yes, sir. APP will submit it. Okay. Hey, what's the case? Punctured a police jeep. Superb! Thought you could get away by giving fake addresses? Are you making us fools? -Sir, a fund collection is happening at the ferry. - What fund? 'They are saying it's a flood relief fund.' '-Please send someone.' - Okay, let me see. Is there any fund collection happening at the ferry? - Yes, I'll send someone. - See to it. What’s the occasion? - It's from the contractor. - Oh no! - I don't want it. - Inspector only asked him to bring it. Why are you not taking the sweet? My politics have always been different. - Sir, from the shipyard... - They are sitting inside. Meet the inspector. Kurian sir, where are you off to? Have to handover a summons in Saudi. Saudi? Are you crazy to go there in this rain? Can't wait for the rain to stop. Where in Saudi? - Mundamveli. - Okay! None of them have appeared in court. Let me see if I can make them appear. 'Saudi Vellakka -CC 225/2009' '[cookery show commentary]' 'Seer fish can also be fried in banana leaves.' 'You can do as you like.' 'Mostly it's done in Pearl Spot.' - Hey, listen! '- What?' Was it the second whistle from the cooker? 'Don't know.' Turn it off when you hear the next. 'Mom, I can't do it with this pregnant belly!' No use in telling her! Kala, where did you get the sardine from? It's from Xavi's. Brought it when they came to see my daughter. Since your daughter's in-laws are fisherfolks, it's easy for you to get fresh fish. Damn! Go away! 'There's formalin in it for sure.' Why is she bothered about my daughter? I know how to look after my family. No wonder she's still living in a rented house. Nosey lady! 'Mom, can you fry the sardine in a banana leaf?' I'm not in a good mood. Don't make me yell at you. Ask your fisherwoman mother-in-law to cook it for you. 'What!' A husband who looks like a sardine! What's your problem? 'Why are you being casteist?' 'I've the right to be a casteist since you had eloped with a Christian.' 'What if I eloped? They look after me better than you.' 'Alright! Go live with them. I don't want anyone here with me.' 'The next time you call me complaining of back pain, I won't pay heed to it.' 'What's the use in calling you? You make things worse for me.' 'Well, I didn't have any relationships when I was studying.' 'How will you have one if you drop out of school in fourth grade?' 'I know very well about your studies.' 'I'm the one who got humiliated in front of the PTA.' 'Why do you always drag in the PTA to win an argument?' Is there anyone here? Hello... - Who are you? - Isn't this Sasidharan's house? - Yes. - Please call him. My father is dead. Who's Abhilash Sasidharan? My brother. - Where's he now? - Bangalore. Bangalore! - What's your name? '-Who's it?' Anusree. Anusree! Is there anyone else here? My mom is there. Mom... Inform Abhilash to appear in magistrate court on Friday. Else it'd become an arrest warrant. - What happened, sir? - What's your name? - Kala... - What? - Kala. - You are Abhilash's... M..mother. How long has it been since your husband died? Eight years. Have you got his death certificate? Yes. Give me Abhilash's phone number. 621214 - What? - It's 62, sir. Is there any problem, sir? 'Pick up the phone.' Hey... Wake up you moron... Bro, pick up the phone. '3 cheers to Chennai Super Kings' 'To our dear Chennai city 3 more cheers!' 'To our dear Chennai city 3 more cheers!' Are you dying to marry off someone? It's to marry off your mother, you scoundrel! Have you got anyone with you? What's it, mom? Won't you let me sleep? I just got back from work. Call me later. Police had come here looking for you. - Police? '- Are you going to ruin this family?' For what? Give it to me. I'll talk to him. 'Mom...' Kunjumon, this is the other case. 'You must appear in court on Friday.' 'You're trapped.' Court? But what did I do? What are you chit-chatting about? - Oh! Stop it, mom. - Give it to me. '-Did you cross-check the address?' - Oh! Dammit! - I'll tell him. - No, let me talk to him. '-One of you please tell me what the matter is.' - Give me a minute. Go inside and talk. People will hear you. What's your problem, mom? 'Hello...' - Hey... '-Tell me.' I'll send you something. Read it and see. Kunjumon, he was saying you'd be arrested. It doesn't look good. What the hell is this? 'I'll send it. Read it and see.' Okay. 'What happened?' Sir, please understand my situation. You must give me two days. - Keep it somewhere. '-No way!' I was talking here. Sir, I'm stuck. It'll become a big problem if I don't go. Please understand. Sir, please try to understand me. 'You don't need to say anything.' 'Quit the job if you can't come.' Sir, I'll surely work from home. 'You can't work according to my orders, right?' 'You're fired!' Sir, don't be so cruel. I asked for only two days leave. Sir, it's a police case. I'll be screwed if I don't go. - Please sir... '- You're fired!' 'Hey, how old are you?' 'Twenty four, sir.' 'What?' Twenty four! 'Do you know how old that woman is?' No, sir. 'She's around 85.' Damn! 'There's a limit for everything.' 'We are to answer at court for the things you do.' Sir, what do I do? I'm not associated with it. Sir, please sort it out somehow. 'You think our job is to sort out your mess?' 'Why are you silent?' 'Aren't you planning to go abroad?' 'Sort out the case...' - No, sir. let me tell you. '- Don't say anything.' 'Appear in court on Friday at 11 am first.' 'We can talk then.' 'Have you started from Bangalore?' '-Have you started?' - I'm on my way. 'Anyway, appear in court on Friday.' Okay, sir. 'Call me when you reach.' Are you taking the bus home to go straight to the police station? Shut up you pest! Hey, go fast! '[A movie is played in the bus]' 'Did he call you?' 'When will you reach tomorrow? Should I send an auto-rickshaw for you?' He was talking as if I committed some big crime. Don't send anyone. Althaf will come to pick me up. 'I was 10 years old back then.' 'I will never forget that horrible day.' 'Ever since my Dad got selected to play the role of Roland in Chavittu Nadakam,' 'people around me have been acting crazy.' 'That's how it is always.' 'When one is excited, the other one is turned off.' Master, what's the problem if I play the role of Roland? What's the problem? Tell me. Roland! Shut up man! Do you have the qualities to be Roland? Have you seen Sasidharan's performance? Learn from him. Don't hurt my feelings. You know me well, right? 'I will burn down Saudi.' - Didn't it come off yet? - I'll pluck it off. '[sings a songs mocking him]' 'Ah! Can someone pull it out?' 'Anu, aren't you eating?' - Mom, what's there to eat? - Semolina bread. Then give it. Keep your legs down. What's this on your uniform? Are you going to school to plough? How do you expect me to wash it in the rain? It's been 5 days since it was washed. Did you copy during the exam again? I was just taking down notes. I know what your notes are about. Why are you standing like a fish caught on a hook? It's been two days since you went for the tuition. Go get ready. - Get going. - Get lost! I'll be humiliated by your teachers during the next parents-teachers meeting too. 'She always copies during exams.' 'At least you study well unlike your father.' Step aside. Do you have any personal grudge towards me? - What language is this? - Malayalam. Mom, he has become wayward. 'Kunjumon, stop fighting with her and go to tuition.' Alright! Nuisance! My back aches from sweeping away these leaves. Let it remain there. I'll show her. This tree ought to be chemically killed. I'll destroy it. Let them file a case if they want. I have faced many cases. Let their leaves lie inside their compound. 'Hey...hey...' - What the heck are You doing? - What? What's it, Umma? Why are you throwing the leaves inside my compound? - I dropped It by mistake. - By mistake! It's just leaves. I saw it with my own eyes. Didn't I tell you I dropped it by mistake? Then why are you wiggling? Wiggle? Stop shouting unnecessarily. You're the one who started this argument. There's no use in talking to you. Don't know how to behave. I know very well who isn't behaving properly. - What's it, mother? - Hey, girl! Girl? - Take this woman inside. - Stop it, Radhakrishnan! Simply arguing with a gentleman. Nuisance. A gentleman who wrecked his daughter's marriage. I'd said this earlier too. Yes, I'm a gentleman. Here comes a gentleman! Mind your business. I know very well about your decency. I know your story too. You don't have to teach me any stories. Say it at your house that you're a gentleman. What's it, mother? What's going on, brother? This has become a usual practice. Mother, are you crazy? We need to live here properly. We're decent people. Is this your decency? 'Mother, why are you going behind it?' 'Why are you fighting with him?' 'I would have spoken to Anitha. It's just some leaves.' - Mother, sit there quietly. - Over our wall. It's a new wall. We're yet to sort out the case around it. 'You call it a case?' - Call Sathaar. '- Are you crazy?' '-Sathaar would be driving now.' - Call Sathaar. - What are You mumbling from the kitchen? - What's your problem? Nazi, it's because you're unable to confront him that I'm asking you to call Sathaar. Why do you have to call him now? He should be the one asking him. You call him. Please be quiet, mother. Sathaar is supposed to confront him. Why are you keeping him away from everything? What's your problem, mother? Do you want to bring him here? Go get the kerosene. What the heck! There is no kerosene here. No kerosene? Then why did you go to the ration shop? Damn! I went to buy rice. Rice? Then who'll buy kerosene? Your brother who's in jail?

'These children.... Hey!' Hey! The floor is slippery up there. If you slip and fall... - No..No.. '- I won't take responsibility.' Hey boy! Aren't you Sasi's son? - Yes. '- Go and study.' It's his father who sidelined me. There seems to be plenty of students. Don't give the evil eye. Four is on this side. Not the other side. None of them are from the gulf. They look like idiots. Just because she was married once, don't be indifferent. When did I show indifference? This is all I've got. Tell them she's from a good Nair family. And it was because the guy was a lunatic they got divorced. Okay? I'll deal with it. That's fine? Are you gonna marry her off by lying? You either perform on the stage or fix marriages. Do just one. That's good for you. - 'There's no use in sailing on two boats.' - I've stopped acting. Mango? - No one can be trusted. - That's what! Take it. What's this? Fifty rupees?

Come fast. Sir, they are coming up through the back door. Come fast. Sir... Sir, we're present. Sir, we've come. Sir, we're present. No one needs to panic. Sir, we need protection. Sir, we need protection. Umma, stay here. I'll be right back. We don't need to worry about that. Police Go back! 'Get lost, you police!' 'Go back! Go back!' 'This is Kerala! This is Kerala!' 'This is Kerala! This is Kerala!' 'Yes, it's the right age.' 'It's from the doctor we got to know he's a Malayali.' 'That's how we got the missing details.' 'Please see the body and confirm it.' 'Ma'am, you alone come inside.' Nazi, go. Go. 'Hurry up. It's getting late.' 'Hey, be careful. Come to this side.' 'Come on.' Nazi... Nazi! That's not him. What about CW1? Isn't he present? We had sent the summons, Your Honour. Then hasn't he appeared? - Respected Court, I've a request. - tell me. Your Honour, it isn't the first time the witnesses failed to appear. Is it? By saying such excuses, they are prolonging the case. - May 24th... - say the date again. May 24th, 2013. Since there was a commotion at the court on that day, the then Magistrate couldn't even hear the case. Two more dates were issued after that. But the hearings didn't take place since the Magistrate was on leave. Then... Once again we got a date. But again the hearing didn't take place since there was a harthal on that day. It's after one and a half years that we got a date for today. Your Honour, considering my client's age and health, I request you to free her. We sent the summons without fail. The hearings can transpire only as per the court's system. Just because the hearing is getting delayed, it doesn't make the accused innocent. 'Your Honour, this case was dealt with by other APP's too.' 'But none of them could come to a decision.' 'Also, they are only alleging that she committed the crime.' - Can you Give me a blank bill? - What? - Blank bill? - We don't give it here. Can't you just give one? How's this to be taken? Put it in the mouth and gulp it. Dhanya, I'll call you back. It's regarding the EMI, right? I'll do something about that. 'How?' I'm the one who pays it every month, right? Then why are you reminding me all the time? 3500 rupees will be ready by today evening. I'll manage it. 'Hey, listen...' - Isn't this the female ward? - Yes. Where's she? Did they all faint? There you are! Are you lying comfortably here? How are you feeling now? There was no need to come here. It's very expensive. What's this? Bun? Where's it from? Don't take it. Will have to pay for it. Did you have breakfast? No, son. You should eat something when you come to court. Sugar levels must have dropped. Listen, they are asking to do a uric acid test. That's not needed. Even I've got uric acid in my body. Umma.... around two thousand rupees... The bill has come to around 2000 rupees. The receptionist is so adamant. She didn't reduce the amount. I'll give the rest the next time. Keep this with you for now. Give it together next time. We can sort it out at the next hearing. Can I go home now itself? 'Hello... can you hear me?' What's the hurry? Let the medicine finish off. Can I go now? You can go when the medicine gets over. '- Hello, Gokul...' - Yes, dear... 'What EMI is it now?' '- Should have married some bank manager. - Then go marry.' 'Okay.' The case is going to get delayed further, Gokulan. What the heck are you saying? What will I tell my client? What can I do? The Magistrate has changed. It's been three years since the case has been deferred due to various reasons. This is not fair! There's a limit in torturing a person. Give me your phone. Let me show him that video. I don't want to see any video. Watch this. Porn is nothing in front of this. This is what's happening here. - See. '- She's brimming with lust. What else!' Magistrates can do whatever they want. Brother, please issue a date. - Case number? - CC 225/2009 - 2009? - Yes. Umma... it's the usual. We're back to square one. The Magistrate ran away. A new person will join. They postponed our case to March. I spoke to the clerk and changed it to December. You had tea? Yes. Umma, have you got 500 rupees with you? We need to pay the clerk for helping us. Listen... By the time things get sorted... ...would I be alive? Don't worry, Umma. Let's see. 'What's there to see, Britto?' On what basis will I sign this? Did you get the dead body? Has such an incident been reported? Then how will I sign this? - Sir, please sign this. - Sir... - Have you checked it? - Yes. It's been so many years... Give it to GD. - What were you saying? - Since it's been many years... What's the use in saying that? What if he comes back after I sign this death certificate? I'll be in trouble then. You wouldn't take responsibility. Neither would she. And I'll be in trouble. - Sir, I understand what you're saying. - You won't. Do one thing. Move it through court. No one's at risk then. You may leave. - Sir! - Come - What happened? - it became viral... He was saying it's to follow up on the case. But it was for this. Did I tell him? Did I ask for the death certificate? Nazi! - I don't want anyone. - Nazi, wait there! How long will you wait? Don't you want to live? This is my life. I will live it. Did you hear me? Why haven't the witnesses appeared till now? Explain! APP! Do you know how many cases I'm hearing today? This is my 97th case. Please have the energy you show in running the case to finish it too. Under which station limits does it come? Thopumpady Police Station. Are you eating the summons we send from here? What cop are you? I don't understand what you people do here. Who's making noise there? Who's it? Didn't you hear me? Hey, bring him here. These people think they can do whatever they want in court. Writes down the FIR as they wish! Can't you show a little bit of sincerity? It's just a piece of paper. Can't you send it on WhatsApp at least? Your honour, since the wards have changed... CW3 Radhakrishanan address has changed. If you can't come to a solution in 9 years, then why are you people here? What about CW1, 2 and 4? CW2 is CW1's son, right? What are you all doing here? Public come here trusting you people. Mr. Mustache, have you got any excuse? It's been only a week since I joined. Wow! Even KG kids make better excuses. A case which got registered in 2009. Still it's pending! This is really ridiculous. Yes! Brother, come here. Are you the one who shouted outside? Sir, for reversing the bike... Don't you know you're not supposed to shout in the court premises? I came to sort out a case. - Go and stand there. - Sir... Go! The one who pleads and the one who fights the case are just the same. Next hearing will be on June 2nd. You should track down everyone in six months. APP! I hope you heard it too. Yes, Your Honour. 'Kunjumon...' 'We have never seen her smiling.' 'There's a numbness on her face all the time.' 'Everyone has only defeated her in life.' 'Including me.' 'Please lose this case to her somehow, Kunjumon.' 'Let her win at least once in her life.' "Failing to see the dayspring" "All round the smouldering night" "Memories get enveloped in shadow" "Known faces depart halfway" "Like the flowers in the whirling wind" Come on, bat! Hurry up! "Seasons dash across some distance" "Come back rowing, realising the truth" Hey... Bose... Hey, isn't there anyone here? The woman there has gone for work. "Donning different roles, I'm wandering aimlessly" Oh no, he's in jail now. He was running a snack shop in Fort Kochi. Here we're running around to track down our liberator, but he himself is in jail. 'Sir, Bose is in jail for selling snacks prepared in engine oil.' - Engine oil? '- We're stuck, sir.' Do one thing. 'Send me the details of his case.' 'We can get him out through a Production Warrant.' What a horrible case! That rascal Radhakrishnan... He had contested in 2007 elections from Saudi as an independent candidate. All he got was one vote. He sold his house and shifted to Thammanam out of embarrassment. Heard that he moved from there also. Let's track him down. "Ignoring the wounds" "Without suffering like a chaff" "I ascended the azure until now" "The loop spirals in the journey ahead" "I sought the footprints of day" "Faraway..." "Faraway..." "Seasons dash across some distance" "Come back rowing, realising the truth" "Donning different roles, I'm wandering aimlessly" "Seasons dash across some distance" '- Sir, please do it for me.' - How's it possible, Abhilash? - Sir, let me talk... - I can only say what is written on the FIR. It's what you all told me that I wrote on the FIR. Sir, can you do something? Then the court would say all that I did during my service was a lie. - Sir, it's been so many years. '- So what?' 'I've got credibility. I can't retract what I said earlier.' All of us are ready to change our statements. But I can't do it, Abhilash. 'Why are you not understanding its seriousness?' It's difficult for me to lie. Bye, Abhilash. Didn't I tell you he's an ass? He won't do it. What's this Production Warrant? There's something like that. We come to know of it only when a need arises. Sir, present him tomorrow itself. He's very much egoistic. - Are you tense? - Of course. Is this the item? - Brother, what's the Magistrate's mood like? - It's terrible. Can we get Thankappan out with this? 'What all steps!' Hey! What about that girl Manju? Try to convince her. Her statement is very important. Don't you know her? She was your classmate, right? Well, I fell in love with her in between this. So it's easy now. And what happened? I dumped her. She got married to someone else. Great! Whatever! Just call her. It's our need. Don't you want to lose this case? Hello... Hello... Hello... - This is me Kunjumon. - What's it? - What do you want? '- Are you free now?' Why did you call me? Who's it? - It's my mom. - Okay. Hello... 'Hello...' Why did you call me? Give me a minute. I need to tell you something. You saw the photo with my husband on Facebook, right? 'Which photo? Hello...' Grandpa, dinner is ready. 'Which grandpa?' If your plan is to wreck my marriage, I won't let you do it. What are you saying? I don't remember the things in the past anymore. I've forgotten you. 'Sudhi, our porridge is ready.' Listen, let me talk first. 'I don't want to hear it.' I've got self-respect. I come from a decent family. You frigging decent woman! You've been babbling for sometime now. I didn’t call you to listen to your babbling. There's a hearing of the case for which you're a witness at Ernakulam court tomorrow. You're the fifth witness. If you don't want to go to jail, come and give the statement tomorrow. If possible, change the statement. It'll do you some good. Hang up you pest! Get lost! Kunjumon... 'Manju... darling...' - Is the porridge ready? - Yes. Then come inside. Hey, Radhakrishnan is in Athani. Come fast. We're in trouble, teacher. Please help. Please make your father understand and tell him to change his statement. His statement is very important. Teacher... please... Father... Father... They are from Saudi. This is how he's been for the last 4 years. Lost his memory. Had gone to the backyard to collect coconuts. Collapsed right there. Brother... - Brother... - Yes? Human beings are worth only this much. - Brother... - Yes? Won't we lose the case tomorrow? "Seasons dash across some distance" 'Umma, are you off to the court?' - Isn't the hearing over yet? - It'll end today. Awesome! I'll give the balance amount now. Ticket... 'Sister, ticket!' 'Bose...' When you go to the court, that advocate nun will teach you what to say. But don't give the statement like she says. You should change your statement. Listen.... I can't lie no matter what. Rubbish! Won't you lie? You can't.... - Hey! What's it? - Kunju.... If you don't change your statement at the court I'll burn you alive. Hey, come here. No, sir. Why he is-? Brother, which case are you talking about? Kunjumon! So this is Kunjumon! Which is the case you were talking about? - Oh, no! - Oh, so you also don't know. Gokulan, I had already given a date in June. I was ready to hear it. Then why did you go to the high court? Respected court, this case has been pending since 2009. The hearing got delayed many times due to various reasons. Delaying it further is injustice towards my client. Who delayed the case? This court? The court had already ordered to present everyone on June 2nd. Your Honour, June is six months away. So what? Court proceedings take time. Gokulan, you can be smart. But don't be over smart. Okay? CW1? CW1 Sasidharan... - Give me some water. - Water? Can I take this water? This is CW1 Sasidharan's death certificate. Is there any witness who is alive? Next! 'CW2 Abhilash Sasidharan!' 'Abhilash Sasidharan!' Go man! Go inside. Repeat after me. I do swear in the name of God that what I shall state... ...shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I do swear in the name of God that what I shall state... ...shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. - What's your name? - Abhilash Sasidharan - Where do you live? - Saudi. Do you know that woman? Abhilash! Do you know that woman? Yes. So on October 1st, 2005... Is it true the accused attacked you mentally and physically? I... I don't remember it, court. This case was filed by the owner of that house Mr. Radhakrishnan and my father. I'm not associated with it. Please free her, court. Wow! Where have you been all this while? The court will decide whether to free her or not. Just say 'yes' or 'no' to the questions. 'You don't have to act saintly in court.' Got it? Your statement says you were beaten up using this coconut frond. Is it true? That's what the doctor's report says. So that's how you lost your tooth. No, court. It was already loose. So you're saying it was not when you were hit with the coconut frond that you lost your tooth It's not like that. But that's what your statement says. - Was it a false statement then? - No... I don't remember anything, court. Your Honour, you may kindly declare the witness as hostile. The witness has turned hostile. The statement given to K Ayappadas of Thoppumpady station... ...by 9 year old Abhilash Sasidharan of Guruprasadam house, Saudi. While my friends and I were playing cricket at the terrace of the house 'Anitha Bhavan', neighbour Ayisha Rawther interrupted our game without any provocation. She verbally abused me and hit me using a bat made of coconut frond. I lost one of my teeth as a result of it. This is what your statement says. I was told to give that statement back then. Gokulan! No cross. CW3 Radhakrishnan Nair! - Radhakrishnan Nair! - Here is the certificate. 'CW3 Radhakrishnan Nair has certified that he won't be able to appear due to health issues.' - Where did you keep that paper? - 'CW4 Bose Thankappan!' 'Bose Thankappan!' '- What's your name?' - Bose Thankappan. What do you do? What? - What's your occupation? - Business. - What business? - I sell snacks. Why did you go to that house on the day of the incident? I'd gone with an alliance for the house owner's daughter. Did you see the accused Ayesha Rawther hitting Abhilash on that day? What? Your statement says you saw her hitting Abhilash and knocking off his tooth. I didn't see anything, court. That was made up by the police officers. So are you withdrawing your statement? How can I talk about something I haven't seen, dear? No! Sister... I mean advocate... Your Honour may kindle declare the witness as hostile. The fourth witness has also turned hostile. I don't think there's any need to read the statement again. Gokulan, anything else? Gokulan! No! CW5 Manju Kishore... Manju Kishore! Manju... dear... Shall we go? '- Won't you buy me lunch? - You buy for us.' - Manju Kishore, right? - It's Manju Sudhi now. Do you know that lady? Yes. On October 2nd 2005, this lady barged into your play area and... ...attacked your friend Abhilash. Manju Sudhi... Eh? What did you see on that day? I was a little girl back then. I was just 7 years old. Is that the question? Did you see the accused hitting the accuser Abhilash Sasidharan? Did you? No, I didn't see. But your statement says you saw her hitting both his legs and back with a coconut frond. Shall I tell you the truth? I don't remember anything. Can I go? Gokulan, ask something to her. Do you remember anything from that day? No. That's all, Your Honor! Next. CW6 Ayyapadas... Ayappadas... - Bye. - Why are you looking at him? Come on. - Is this the mainour you collected? - Yes. From where? Will you deny it if I say this case has been fabricated? Of course. Oh no! Have you seen that lady before? No. That's all, Your Honour. 313 tomorrow. Is it okay for you, Gokulan? Yes. 'CC 225/2009 Ayisha Rawther!' 'Ayisha Rawther!' Umma, speak. I had hit him, sir. What! Come forward. Let me hear you. I hit him, sir. I hit him with a coconut frond. I did it in the heat of the moment. He lost his tooth because of me. It's been 13 years. I'm ready to endure any punishment for that. We lost! I have a request. Please allow me to ask him for forgiveness. 'Final hearing will be held tomorrow.' 'Next case!' '[azan from mosque]' The accused herself has pleaded guilty in front of the court. I don't think there's a need to explain the points one by one now. Ayisha Rawther has confessed before the court that... ...she indeed hit Abhilash using a coconut frond. Not just that. This has been clearly stated in the FIR too. Your Honour... Most of the offenses in my client's name have been fabricated. The accuser himself has stated that his tooth was already loose. Hence I humbly request you to eschew section 326 from my client's charge sheet. Considering my client's age and health... ...I request the court to reduce the severity of her punishment. Considering the age of the accused, the judgment will be pronounced post lunch. - Is that okay, Gokulan? - Yes, sir. 'Umma, I need to go to the harbor.' There's some complication there. I'll sort it out and try to come back. Else I will come home. Don't worry, Umma. Everything is going to get fixed today. - Go, son. - Okay. The accused has been found not guilty for the offense under section 324 and 326 IPC. But is found guilty for the offense under 294B, 341 and 323 IPC. Does the accused have anything to say about the punishment? As per the sections mentioned above, since the court has understood that... ...the accused is guilty... ...the court imposes a fine of 5000 rupees and sentences to one day. - So have you got any cash on you? - Hey, we didn't lose. I've only got 250 rupees for my bus fare and my advocate's fees 1000 rupees with me. I can't hear you. What's it, Gokulan? Your Honour... She has got only her bus fare 250 rupees and my... and 1000 rupees to pay her advocate. But the fine has to be paid. Sir... I'll make the payment. Umma, have you eaten anything? I'm not hungry, son. Shall I buy you a tea and bun? What time is your bus? My timings have gone all wrong, son. Have it. - Did you buy this? - No. I made it. - Is it? - Yes. Have it. - It's tasty. - Is it? Have it. I had come many times to see you. But no one let me come near you. Wasn't there a felicitation ceremony at your school when you got good marks in 10th grade? I was there among the crowd. I had come for your father's funeral too. Weren't you wearing a blue shirt for your sister's wedding? You were looking very handsome. I wished to talk to you on that day. But I didn't come out of fear. That's what the court says, right? I was not allowed to come near you or talk to you. But now I can talk. Please forgive me, son. Umma, I'll hold that. - Let me go to the washroom. - Okay. Be careful. - Mom... '- Where are you at?' - Hello Mom... '- How did it go?' The verdict has come. 'We are not in trouble, right?' Umma has to pay 5000 rupees as fine. 'I paid for her.' Oh, no! Was it for this 5000 rupees worth case that I made an offering for 10,000 rupees? It turned out to be an inhuman verdict. Umma and I talked for a long time. What's there to talk about this much? 'You come home.' Mom, can't we bring her home? 'What!' Shall we look after her? Are you insane? I'm serious. 'We've got more than enough here.' Just come home. 'Oh, no!' Hello... Hello [Indistinct chatter] What happened? Bring a vehicle. Move from there. - How do you feel now? - Not at all good, Umma. - It's so difficult. - That's alright. It's a boy. She's saying it's a boy. 'Many people said it's going to be a girl.' 'Let me sit there.' Umma... I'll wait outside. Why are you laughing? What's it? 'Umma... get up.' 'Take the medicine after eating this bun.' Umma, are you hungry? Have this bun for now. We can go home later and have porridge. It's a small piece. - Is it nice? - Umma, you're simply awesome. Of course. Kunjumon.... Didn't you ask the other day whether human beings are worth only this much? Human beings are worth this much! 'SAUDI VELLAKKA'
