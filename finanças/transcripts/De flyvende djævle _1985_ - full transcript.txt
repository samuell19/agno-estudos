[knocking lightly] Lazlo, I want you to meet Nina Rosta. She's a journalist from Rome. Ah. A pleasure. My pleasure. Miss Rosta wants to use you in a story she has been doing on the dying art of the circus performer. Well, Miss Rosta, we are very busy right now-- Extremely busy. Didn't Mr. Seidenbaum tell you? This was our last show. We are on our way to America. Maybe you would like to come to our engagement party tonight. We are giving a little press conference. No, I'm sorry. I made already other plans. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, Miranda and Max. Hello. Good evening. Well? Well... Um, good luck for the engagement party. Thank you. [overlapping chatter] Please, please, please, please. Thank you. I wish to toast our newly engaged couple-- my beautiful daughter and her husband-to-be-- my protege, my friend, my colleague, my friend. Together, we shall do the quad. May the gods lay their protecting hands upon you. And a little bit of advice for the future-- my dear Mory, stay away from gambling, which leads to poverty, women who lead you to ruin, and liquor, which leads you to death. [laughing] [camera shutter clicking] Three cheers for Miranda and Mory! Long may they live! Hip, hip, hip... [all] Hurrah! Hip, hip, hip... [all] Hurrah! Hip, hip, hip... [all] Hurrah! Mory, how does it feel to leave Europe? Fine, fine. Um... Just fine. First, we are going to Las Vegas. Uh, Caesar's Palace-- that's it. Is a quadruple somersault possible? Just you wait. You will see. Is it true that Bert Lancaster will pay $1/4 million to the troupe that does the quad if it is recorded during the performance? Yes. Is it the $250,000 that attracts you? Maybe. Maybe to a certain extent. But the glory, gentlemen-- the glory. How do you compare Mory Ventura with your old partner Tony Wilde? Tony was great, real great. But Mory will be greater-- much greater. But is Tony Wilde behind these very ambitious American plans? Las Vegas is the product of a collaboration between myself and Oscar Seidenbaum. [crackling and booming] [Lazlo] Let thy face shine over us and protect us from illness and accidents, from division and poverty. Bless also my soul in heaven and protect Tony from all the evils of the world in America, and thank the good Lord that we are not like the Corellis, lacking both talent and a classic fire. Keep thy protecting hand over us now and forever and ever, amen. [blowing] Good night. Let's all get to sleep. The first think I'm gonna do when we get to America is buy a car-- an American one-- my Cadillac. What do you think they do there at night? In America? Yeah. [sighing] In America, you can do whatever you want, any time of the day or night. Do you think she does it? The girl at the ice cream stand? [laughing] Do you mean the one with the really big things? Yes. [laughter] [pounding] [Lazlo] Go to sleep! No Las Vegas? Why not? Because the timing isn't right. This is exactly the time when we should go! You are not billing me to hold truce! Why have you changed your mind so suddenly? Because I suddenly decided $20,000 is too much money to risk on you. But it's just a loan! I guarantee you will get it back! What do we do now? There are a lot of touring circuses left. [laughing] Running around. Really? Look, Lazlo's the greatest catcher. The greatest of them all, you know? [Oscar] Probably. How much money have you been making of me over the years? And you from me. Do you remember, Oscar? In the old days... Tony... Maria, God bless her. What a troupe. And we'll be greater-- much greater! When we have achieved the quad, we'll be the greatest! Please take your hands off my desk. [Oscar] Would you be so kind as to close the door? [whistling] [laughing] A present for you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Did I make a mistake or is this the boat to America? A slight detour and for a commitment-- 14 days at the Cirque Du Ver in Paris.

Remember how much Papa does for us. Are you going to talk to him, Mory? Yes or no? Hurry up! She'll be here soon! He comes off at a speed of over 100 kilometers per hour when he leaves the trapeze. He has one second and a half to spin around three and a half times in utterly not longer than this time on here. Incredible. [Lazlo] Then he has to stop at exactly the right moment. To do that, he has to open up, and the rest is my problem. I see he is only semiconscious. You do this simply through bold force, high up-- at the most, 15 centimeters matching for errors. As it was, he hit me in the face. Right in the face. Do you see? [gasping] Eh, do you see? But didn't it hurt? Sure, it hurts. He broke my nose. And what is the most dangerous moment? The problem is to stop the spin, to come out of the rotation. You have to figure that out. Oh, thank you. Please. Mm-hmm. Cheers. Cheers. Oh! Oh! How stupid! [laughter] No, no, it's all right.Excuse me, excuse me. [camera shutter clicking] Hup! Yeah, let him get close to you. Here, roll over. Okay, fine. Yep. Can you do another hop down? Just hop down.

When you do the quad, you can drink this, and it will taste very good. Thank you. We thank you. And give my best to Mr. Seidenbaum when you see him. Oscar Seidenbaum no longer exists. What? To me. Why not? Differences. His age is getting to him. He's losing his judgment. That's a pity. Life will go on without Oscar Seidenbaum. Well, good-bye. Oh, good-bye. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Of course, I think it does now. Oscar has strange ideas... but I think we can do him this little favor. It's only Oscar, and you'll get a fine dinner. Believe me-- luxury, I bet. Oscar is a man of means. I want to talk with Mory. Oh! Mory! Just one corner! Mory! Yeah? What sort of evening is this? Why aren't you coming? Oscar didn't invite me. But you are my fiance. Well, Lazlo said. My Miranda, this is all just a part of the job. If you only knew how many jerks I had to have dinner with... If you only knew. Cheers, mate. Salud. Cheers. Those guys, they know how to get paid millions. Millions-- millions just to kick a ball. It's a crazy world. Yeah, crazy. When do we reach Salerno? Tomorrow night, if we drive like hell. How long are we gonna be there? Just two days. Why? Just wondered. Now, boys, let's have a good time tonight. If Miranda can go out, so can we. Go easy on the drinking. You have to talk louder. I can't hear you. What? No, you have to promise-- not just "maybe." Look, I'll be waiting for you there from 2:00. ♪♪ I sat in a blooming wheat field in the Steiermark of my childhood. I saw the white clouds floating across the heavens, slow motion, and I dreamed that I would conquer the world, I would fly an airplane. I would hover in the sky. I would be a bird, I would be free. That was the year I could run. That was my last year of happiness. I was seven years old. The only green was the Schiller family and the flower of it was your mother, Maria. There I stood, with two small children who had lost their mother-- a terrible accident. She lived her life for the trapeze. She gave everything, and when she didn't have any more to give, she gave her whole life. We can never forget that, because it's for her sake that we are going to succeed. Mory... [background chatter] Mory? [background chatter] I would like to see you happy. Really happy. To see you live a good life. But I do. My dear Miranda, this is not what you were born for. You remind me so much of your mother, and it just mustn't end the same way. She wouldn't listen to reason and paid a big price for it. Poor Maria. Her life could have been so different-- both hers and mine. Your life can't be that way-- not like Maria's. But you cannot protect yourself from accidents. I brought this in Klagenfurt at Schuster's. I never had a chance to give it to her. Leave this life. Why can't you understand what's best for you? You could have everything-- a life of comfort, a life you could control. No more begging. Why do you say no? Why do you say no? My heart burns as it always does. I just want to see you happy. I'm not prepared, do you understand? [laughing] I'm sorry. [sighing] Accident? What kind of accident are you talking about? Maria didn't die in an accident. She was used to the limit by your father. She could not take much. Her illness was neglected. There's no room in your father's world for weakness. Now I know why they call you-- Yes, yes, I know, I know. As soon as they see me limping up, they expect disaster. Papa has done everything for us. [laughing] For himself, you mean. You can't talk that way about my father. It's about time you find out what life is all about. That's just what I'm starting to do. That's good. What do you think this is a payment for? This is 2,500 marks. Well, I'll tell you. This is what your dear father thinks that a night with his beloved daughter is worth. Take the envelope home and see if he doesn't ask for it. [dog barking] Miranda... you shouldn't be waiting up for us. Oh! [laughter] By the way, did Uncle Oscar... have anything for me? [envelope rustling] [bottle clattering] Miranda. [bell tolling] [Lazlo] Now you've had a chance to see what the world is like, how people try to have a good time and half the world, you just see the answer. Don't you think that we're going fast and all this trouble and discomfort is coming to an end? Stop sulking. I think I'm gonna be sick. There isn't time. Open the window.... [vomiting] Just think how you were at the party last night. And this is the thanks I get? [thunder rumbling] It's always the same. You have to take the bad with the good. Same old shit! Just wait until we get to the States. Just wait? Just wait? I'm sick of waiting. This way, we'll never get to the States. We'll never get anywhere. Soon, we will be in a big hotel suite with room service and orange juice, and you will buy yourself a Cadillac in Nevada and you will do anything you want. Lazlo's full of talk, Max. That's all it is-- talk! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Max. Have you got-- have you got any money? Why? I need it. Uh, I have to buy a present. A good day, then. This will cheer her up.

She's a journalist. Ah, the white Jaguar, the nice clothes, the big sunglasses, and all the rest of the junk she uses, and which impress you so much. Do you think it's for free? No, I am sorry.
