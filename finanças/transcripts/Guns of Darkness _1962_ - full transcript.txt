A typical English New Year's Eve party. Come, everybody, join hands. It is an old English custom. ♪ Should old acquaintance be forgotten? ♪ Adios, Presidente. Adios, Hernandez. Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention for a minute please? In 10 minutes time we should be welcoming... Large whiskey, please. We should be welcoming in the New Year, but before we start to make our good resolution-- As I said, before we start making our good resolutions, may I as your host and as managing director of Napier's International Plantations, known to you all affectionately as NIP-- Hear, NIP. Known to you all affectionately as NIP, may I say how glad I am to see you all here tonight? And to our friends in whose country we are, I hope, welcome guests and in particular to Senor Hernandez, who has taken time off from his ministerial duties to be with us tonight, our best wishes for the continued peace and prosperity of this happy and hospitable corner of the world. Very good, HB. There. Well, I think it's about time we got ready for Auld Lang Syne. We shall have to have two circles, one in this room and one in the other room. And you'll help me round up the stragglers, won't you, Mrs. Bastian? Leave it to me, HB. We'll have to make two circles. If everyone in there will take that corner. Herbert, you go and look after that circle. And everyone here will go into the other room, we make another... Ah, Mrs. Jordan, I'm sure you wouldn't mind helping my husband over there. No, with pleasure. And I'll help HB. Come along, Senor Hernandez. Now please excuse me, Mr. Bryant, I may have to leave. I'm expecting a call. But this will only take about a minute. Ah, then it is not a religious ceremony, like cricket. Oh, no, nothing of the kind. No, it's just an old English custom. It's no good, senor. No good at all. You're on the property of Napier's International Plantations, known to us all affectionately as NIP. And when boss Bryant orders you into the chain gang, into the chain gang you go. And I have job for Charlie. Please, please. Here we are into the magic circle. Not this one, dear. You promised to help Mr. Bastian, remember? Oh, oh, oh, of course. Come on, Tom. Come on in, Mrs. Jordan. That's it. By the way, the wife and I were hoping that you and Mr. J could come and take pot luck with us tomorrow night. HB is coming, but it's quite informal. Oh, I'm sure we'd love to, wouldn't we, Tom? You're all ready, Bastian? Yes, HB. All together, everyone. Wait for it. Wait for it. There's a couple of minutes to go yet. Tom... Happy New Year. Oh, Mrs. Jordan, a Happy New Year to you. Happy New Year. And you, too, Bryant. And you needn't bother to kiss me. Something might fly out of that... Happy New Year to you. You, too, sir, Mr. Hernandez. Thank you. By the way, what are you? Excuse me? In the government. I mean, mines? Fuel? Agriculture and fisheries? I see. No, I'm afraid mine is a more humble position, Mr. Jordan. I am justice. Adios, Rivera. Viva Zoreno! You know, it's extraordinary how well you speak French. It is not strange. I studied in Paris at the Sorbonne. Ah! Well, that explains it. Merci, madame. Excuse me, Mr. Bryant, I find I must leave you now. So soon? Yes, it is sooner than I expected. I'm sorry. Goodnight, Mrs. Jordan. Goodnight. I hope we may meet again soon, at the opera perhaps. Oh, I hope so. Goodnight. Goodnight. Do let me show you to the door. Please don't bother. Goodnight, Mr. Bryant. Goodnight and a Happy New Year. Viva Rivera. Viva Rivera. Viva Zoreno! Personally I find him charming. Oh, do you know, Tom, that he speaks French almost as well as English? Mm-hmm, he does. Napier's should appoint you, Mrs. Jordan, as public relations officer. Yes, you'd make a splendid plantation hostess, one of Bryant's nippies. Oh, what an excellent idea, Tom. Now when can I start, Mr. Bryant? And what will be your terms? I never talk business at parties, Mrs. Jordan, and never with beautiful women. Aw. Really? Extraordinary. Now I should've thought-- That it was a marvelous opportunity. I quite agree, Tom. Now, Mr. Bryant, you can't get out of this. Let's talk it over while we dance, shall we? Delighted. I'm so glad you don't mind my husband's rather schoolboy sense of humor. Oh, I know some people do, especially rather pompous people, you know. On the contrary, I find him rather... refreshing. I'm so sorry that's over so quickly. Tell me what part of France are you from? Medoc. Oh, the wine country. Yes, my father had a vineyard. As big as one of our plantations? Oh, I expect it is quite small really, but it used to seem big to me, as big as the whole country. And you, of course, was his princess. And then one day, a rather beaten-up representative of the London suburban wine company came down the drive with dust on his shoes and his suitcase full of empty bottles and dirty shirts-- And they lived happily ever afterwards. In a manner of speaking. Well, it's getting frightfully late, Tom. I think we ought to go home. Let's. Well, thank you so much. It's been such a lovely party. So glad you enjoyed it. Oh, yes, I did. Let me show you around Napier's one of these days. Oh, I should love it. Mr. Bryant goes out of his way to keep the staff happy and the wives, particularly the wives. Tom, you are wicked. When you've been out here as long as I have, Jordan, you may learn to mix with our little community. What the hell do you think I am? A new boy, comparatively speaking. Three months, still in his first term, huh? Waiting for you to teach me the nicknames of all the masters, and what they call the lavatories in six form B. Well, I know what the peasants call you anyway. Come on, let's get some air. Goodnight. Goodnight. Thank you for the lovely party. What's the matter? Go on, tell me, what's the matter? Oh, I know, I behaved badly at the party. But I always behave badly at parties. What about that party? That wine tasting party your father gave, remember? When I said I thought the 1953 vintage reminded me of a rather vivacious little cup of tea that I found in the cafe on the North Circular Road, remember? You laughed at that once. It was a long time ago. Tom. Tom, coming to bed? Coming to bed? Tom... it's a new year. So they told us at the party. And what's this, the thaw? Oh, be different please. Try. Different? What do you mean "different"? Stop being a child. What do you want me to be? Grown-up and mature like Bryant and all those idiots with their funny hats. Oh, God, it's starting again. What are you smoking for anyway? Oh, do you mind? I thought if you had anything interesting to say, I'd keep awake and listen. What do you want me to say? Just how you think we're going to go on living together, that's all. If you can't live with me, that's your problem. Oh, yes. Oh, yes, it's always my problem. What were you doing when we met? Buying wine for a firm that went broke. Married to a woman who never cared what happened to you. Oh, Gwen. Tch. What a ridiculous name. At least she liked me just as I was. Hmm. With the boyish charm. Well, that's wearing a bit thin now if you want to know the truth. And I'll tell you the truth. You always wanted me different, didn't you? You always wanted to change me. Well, I didn't succeed. In making a man of me? Huh, you sound like some ridiculous headmaster. Oh, it's not funny when you say those things anymore, and it's not funny when you're rude at parties. Now, look, I can be rude to who I like, you understand? I'm free. As far as being rude is concerned, I'm absolutely free. No! You've got a job to look after and a marriage, remember? You make marriage sound like some bloody awful purchase agreement. Pay up for 50 years, it's yours when you die. Oh! How can you say that when I came with you, when you didn't even have a job or money or anything? I came to that dreary hotel to provide the evidence, and the rooms we lived in while you change jobs and saved up to pay for the cost of the divorce. Nobody forced you. Well, I did it because you were human and you were funny and you were alive. Not just angry with people for no reason and hopeless for no reason and never doing anything that makes any sense. We just can't go on. We can't go on. We could go on if you just be a wife. A wife? How could I be more of a wife? Well, you can hate the same people I hate for a start. And then you can stay at home and bath the children, maybe. Do what? Bath the children, if you'd ever had any. You see I'm trying to sleep. I am sorry, darling. Well, it's too late. Good morning, Gabriel. Senor. You wish I to stay here. Yes, of course. You will give me protection. Gabriel, please, this is not my day. What are you talking about? You had the guns last night. When people hear that, they go into the hills. My cousin is on his way there, but if he could stay here 2, 3 days. He can sleep in kitchen. He's very good cook. And another advantage, he plays guitar. All right. Thank you, senor. Thank you. What is all this about anyway? We have a new president. Oh, congratulation. What's his name, the new president? General Zoreno. Well, viva Zoreno. Viva Zoreno Viva Rivera. Good morning. Hello. Where is everybody? All our workers disappear into their holes as soon as there's any trouble. They'll be back in a few days. In the meantime, we got a new face to look at. Zoreno's? Yes. I've arranged for photograph of him to be laid off. Do we have to? Just a little courtesy. Napier's would like us to extend it. To the new man in power. Exactly. Is it over? Bar the shooting? Is there going to be much more of that? I understand that Rivera has made a run for it. I heard it on the radio. I expect they'll have caught him by now. There will be a trial, of course, in the sports arena. 2,000 votes to none in favor of the extreme penalty. They always send their disused presidents to the sports arena. You made it sound very quaint. I'm sorry. There's a lot to be said for Rivera, provided we stick to theory, of course. Abolishing the death penalty. Freeing the press. Granting the vote to a lot of Indians who could neither read nor write. And then what happens? The army takes over. By the way, I see your friend Hernandez is with Zoreno. Still minister of justice. I always thought he was intelligent. You better take one of these. What's that for? Flag for your car. You may find it useful if there's any in trouble. What am I supposed to do then? Salute and sing "Abide with me?" You know, I wish you wouldn't make jokes. It'd be far better for your career with Napier's if you were to stop making jokes. Jokes? On my way here this morning, I saw a man. He was running beside the car with his face all dabbed with paint like a clown. He kept on sort of clawing at the window and then he screamed something I didn't understand. Well? They shot him. You could have done nothing. I could have stopped. Just as well for you that you didn't. Why? Because Napier's might have got in wrong with the new powers. You won't believe me, Jordan, but I was thinking of you. Here you are, doctor. Thanks. Beautiful, isn't it? You know, you're the only Napier's wife that'd buy these things. Go into the other houses and what do you get? Plaster galleons in full sail. Why do you want to see me? I'm pregnant. Well, congratulations to you both. But Tom doesn't know. I wanted to tell him that... Oh, surely, that's the wife's privilege. Oh, no, no, no, not about the baby. I wanted to tell him that I'm going home. Why? Say that the climate doesn't suit me. Tell him I can't stay for medical reasons. Tell him that... Oh, you know what to say. What's the real reason? I'm tired. I'm sick of smiling and pretending that all his sneers and insults are just school boy jokes I love to laugh at. Last night he... Yeah? Last night he said that it was my fault we didn't have any children. Well, there's no reason why you shouldn't have a perfectly healthy baby if you take care of yourself. I've had two miscarriages. Each time we'd be moving. Leaving a job that isn't grand enough for his great, big personality. Well, please, will you tell him, doctor? That's Tom. Well, he's early, isn't it? I can't think what has happened unless... Unless what? Oh, nothing. I'll leave you two together. You tell him, please, doctor. Hello, doctor? Anybody ill? No, I was passing. You're home early. Oh, plantation is all deserted. So I drove through the town. Been a little rough there I understand. You could call it that. They don't last, you know. Never last very long. But there are times out here when you have to look in the opposite direction. God, what a country! Suits me. Of course, it doesn't suit everyone. Your wife for instance. What's the matter? Is Claire ill? Nothing, nothing to worry about. But may I speak to you as man to man? You know, the way it strikes me I-- Is it a go? Yes, like a bomb. But talking of Claire, I hope you won't think that I'm trying to interfere. I know it's none of my business. It isn't really, is it? Thanks for calling. Who's that? Goodbye, Mr. Jordan. Who's it? Rivera. Riv... He's hurt. Shut up! You haven't seen anything. Get inside the house. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna get him off your front yard. Why? Where to? Just as far as those trees. I'll dump him over there. Dump him? You can't do that. Then what do you suggest? Well, take him in the house, of course. You want us all shot? Right, you do that, you go, and I'll call the police and tell them that he was in your car. You don't understand this place. You're a doctor, aren't you? I'm not a suicidal idiot! Shut up. You give me a hand. Get him out this side. Easy now. Amigos? Amigos. I'll take his legs. Easy now. Well? Lost a lot of blood. I give him about 24 hours. That shot will kill him? I'm thinking of the next one he's due to receive. Who's that? You can trust him. Can't trust anyone, if you want to stay alive. Personally I do. You may have your own private reasons for giving it all up. I still find life really bearable. Just a minute. Can he be moved? For the sake of your health, get him out of here as soon as you can. What about his? He needs rest. I've done all I can. And-- And don't forget, if anyone asks, I wasn't here. I didn't notice you anyway. Feeling better? Your house? You have been very kind. I will not trouble you any longer. Stay there. Gabriel? Gabriel, now, I want you to lend some of your clothes to the president. It is an honor, senor. And then tell your cousin to get something together for us to eat. Anything that's in the kitchen. Pack it up and put it in the back of the van. Yes, senor. Where do you think you're going? To the frontier. That's 100 kilometers. 98. I will hide in your garden till night where I was till I heard the trucks. I thought it will be safe in the doctor's car. Must have fainted or something. Very inconsiderate of me. Should I be caught, no one here has seen me, Mr... Jordan. And you're not going to get caught. I'm gonna hide you where you're safe, near the frontier. And then when you feel more like it, you can cross. You must feel strongly about politics. Then why are you doing this? I haven't thought yet. Gabriel, help the president get dressed and then burn his clothes. Everything that's his. Yes, senor. Tom? And, Gabriel, be as quick as you can, too. Oh, darling, I may go back to Napier's again. There's no use arguing. Something came up. It's rather important, it shouldn't take too long. I'll be as quick as I can, and I'll be back-- Tom, aren't you going to say anything? Aren't we going to talk about it? Senor, he is ready. Good. Help him into the car, would you, please? Darling, listen, nothing that should concern you. What? What needn't concern me? Who is that man? What's been happening? There's nothing for you to worry about. We found a man outside and he's badly hurt. So I'm gonna take him somewhere where he can rest. Oh. Where? To Napier's. To the country club. It's closed but-- Oh, does he work for Napier's? No, he's going to be sort of a guest. Not that he's been invited yet, but... Well, I think it's better to call the hospital. No, don't do that. Tribulacion? I'm taking him to the club. As a matter of fact, I'll be doing him a favor. They'll have a chance to show their hospitality to a genuine native. He'll be able to sit at the pool and sleep in that bed that Mr. Bryant uses for his weekend adventures. Then when he feels a little bit better, he can have a nice old English game of darts all by himself in the old English bar parlor. If only you could be serious for 5 minutes. Try me when I get back. I'm never serious till after dinner. I won't be here. What do you mean? I was going anyway. I asked Dr. Swann to tell you. I thought you'd come in and we could talk sensibly. I thought we could be quiet until I went home. Senor? All right, Gabriel. Darling, look, I'll be back. I'll be back and then we'll talk. Oh, Tom! Tom, I've got to talk to you. You must listen to someone else for once in your life. Look, darling, this evening we'll go to the Bastian's and afterwards we'll talk. You'll see, everything's gonna be perfectly normal. Just as if nothing had happened. There we are. Don't drink all the beer before we get there. We'll celebrate after that. Give me the cover. Right. Just pop underneath that. And by the way, you better have a signal in case I want you to keep your head down, so I'll whistle at you, huh? What-- What tune? Oh. Pop goes the weasel. Got it? Don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right. Right. Fasten your seatbelts. Cosmopolitan Hotel? Reception please. Hello, this is Mrs. Jordan, Claire Jordan. I would like to be on the flight to Paris tomorrow. Pase? Oh, pass. Look, I'm English. You saw the flag. Pase? I have an appointment at Napier's rest house. Urgent business. Pase? Look, I'm just going over the other side. It's about 5 or 6 kilometers, I'll be back in half an hour. Pase! Sergeant, this man is asking me for a pass. I have my... I got my international... international driver's license. Will that be all right? Is this you? Yes. You know these passport pictures. No one can cross the river, senor, without a pass. Look, I have an important appointment, I'm late. It's government business. You must go to the ayuntamiento, senor. To the town hall? Si, senor. Can I get a pass there? It's posible, senor. Pase? Colonel Hernandez, have you a statement? And, colonel, what about Rivera? Have you got him? The date of his trial has already been arranged. Naturally we expect him to be present. Colonel-- Colonel Hernandez, we met last night. Do you remember me? I remember you, Mr. Jordan. Perhaps you can help me. Perhaps. Well, I was trying to get a pass to cross the river. Why? I have an appointment at Napier's rest house. Ah! Important business at the nets perhaps. Whatever happens, the English must not miss their games of catch. Well as a matter of fact, you guessed it. Is that your business appointment? Yes, next week is our big match with non-ferrous metals. I mean, you mustn't expect your revolution to interfere with that. After all, that's the most important event of the year for us. What a dull year you must have, Mr. Jordan. I don't suppose you'll make anything so serious as trouble. Thank you. Thank you very much. There. Nombre. Jordan. Here we are. Bueno. Good. Thank you. Momento, senor. We must look. Oh, they looked at the town hall. It does not say so on the pass, senor. Oh, they probably forgot. Open please the back. It's locked. Give me the keys, senor. I've lost them. Look, when I was-- Open please the back. You have no authority to look. Open the back! Look, I'm British. I mean, I was checked at the town hall. From the Hotel Cosmopolitan? Senora Jordan? Oh, yes. We wish to speak with your husband. I'm afraid he's not here. We will wait. But I'm just going out. No, senora. I think you're wrong there. Where are we? Just across the river from my house. You can see it. In that house? I brought some people we know. They have a boat. I'll go and try and get my wife out. If she's still there. Does she know about me? No. Do you think it might help her? But with Zoreno, I'm afraid. All right. Take my watch. If I'm not back in half an hour, leave the car and you're on your own. Thank you, Mr. Jordan. Herbert! Look, you're not even dressed yet. They'll be here at any minute. For goodness sake, go, get dressed. Ah. I'm so sorry to be late. That's all right. The Jordans aren't here yet. Oh, really? He didn't even phone like you. He lacks your polish. You have such wonderful manners, Hugo. Come in, HB. Hello. Come and have a little something for your cough, eh? We must go see about the meats. It's too bad of the Jordans. Senor. They're here. Police? Soldiers with the senora. Your husband went to work this morning. Then what happened? Come, Mrs. Jordan. There is a limit to our patience. Mrs. Jordan, do not try to put us off. Did your husband not drive his car? Good evening. Hello, darling. Well, look at all that ash. Filthy smoking habits. Mr. Jordan. Yes? We have been waiting for you, Mr. Jordan. Good, because I wish to lodge a complaint. A complaint? At Tribulacion at the bridge, some of your undisciplined soldiers fired on my car. I can only imagine they were drunk. You did not stop. We had a report from Tribulacion. Of course, I didn't stop for those trigger-happy idiots. What'd you expect me to do? Stay and get shot? May even happen, this, Mr. Jordan. There was someone with you, wasn't there? I saw him leave, there was no one. Look, there's a perfectly good ashtray. Will you mind? Did you or not have a passenger? Answer us. Yes, I did. A strange sort of passenger that lies on a floor, hidden under a cloth? I thought that was rather eccentric myself. But then a solution occurred to me. I don't think he wanted me to know he was there. You did not know. Perhaps he crawled into the van when it was in the garage. Maybe he wanted a free lift, some tramp rather. It's very amusing. Oh, it's true, they're always doing it. Tramps, women, children, chickens, always crawling into cars. You'd think they want to live there. Maybe it's the housing shortage in your beautiful country. Well, are you satisfied, gentlemen? Not quite, Mr. Jordan. Where is your car now? In the garage, of course. I didn't hear you drive up. Maybe because you were shouting so much. Now are you satisfied? One more thing. You have another more thing to tell us. What's that? Where is your passenger? He's still asleep I expect. Do you want to see him? No need for you to come, darling. Oh, I'd like some air. Open quickly. Quickly. What are you laughing about? Oh, it's marvelous, isn't it? I mean, you've gotten thrown out of some strange places at quick notice, but you've never done anything like this before. I try to keep you out of it. Oh, that's right. Tom Jordan, the lone hero, with complete disregard for his own safety. He snatched his wife from a nice clean bedroom and saved a sick man from going to hospital. The regiment is proud of you. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, but let's be sensible, Tom. We'll go straight back to Tribulacion. I'll go and see Colonel Hernandez, and I'll explain everything to him. Thank goodness, he's civilized. I think you're gonna miss your nice little laugh with Colonel Hernandez. Why? Because we're going to Los Indos River which is about 30 miles further on. We'll cross that somehow, and then we'll walk to the frontier. Oh, I see. Carrying a wounded man with us, I suppose. Yes, if he can't walk. But I can walk, Mr. Jordan, if you would stop the car. I owe you so much. Please spare me the pain of causing unpleasantness between you and your wife. You don't, and I'm not going to stop the car. Mr. Jordan, please. Look, it won't save us to drop you, you said that yourself. Yes, but you would travel light, much lighter. Who are you? Oh, forgive my manners, Mrs. Jordan, I should have introduced myself. Pedro Rivera. Who? Pedro Rivera, I am, I think, president of the Republic, I doubt if there was time for an election. That was quite delicious. Oh, the wife manages the fancy stuff, all right. It's the boiled egg we can't cook well, can we? Herbert. It's not the egg itself so much. It's the time that seems to be at fault. Really? Herbert! It's either pure water or of a rock like consistency. Herbert, Mr. Bryant isn't interested in eggs. Yeah, there's a simple device on the market for checking the time of eggs. Ah, now that must be the Jordans. I hope he isn't tight. Oh, good evening, colonel. Mr. Bryant, I am looking for one of your employees, Jordan. Where is he? Well, that's what we'd like to know. What's Jordan been doing? Some ridiculous joke? I believe it's serious to help a traitor escape. What? A man was found hiding in Jordan's car. Well, if he was found... Jordan drove off with him as he was about to be arrested. We wish to find this enemy of the state. Who is he? Our ex-president. Rivera? Yes. I bet you were member of his government when we last met, of course. I was justice, Mr. Bryant. And justice does not change with governments. I believe that is true even in England. So Mr. and Mrs. Jordan are expected here. Quite a coincidence. Yes, but they haven't come. We shall see. Is there no longer enough adventure for you in the manufacture of sugar, Mr. Bryant? Lopez. Hey, colonel, what's the game? In England I believe you call it hide and seek. You knew who he was, of course. Swann told me. The president. Does it make any difference? Well, you could have told me. I'm not a child, you know. Oh, but no, everything has to be so secret. You have to do everything on your own. Oh, for God's sake, I let one man get killed today, isn't that enough? Besides... What? Oh, nothing. I need to find a place to cross. Mrs. Jordan. Yes? Mrs. Jordan, your husband was worried about your safety. It would have been dangerous for you to know who I was. Look, if you expect anyone to be reasonable... I don't. I only hope we can all stay together for a short time, of course. Operator. Operator, you cut me off three times already. What's happened? It seems a car has been hidden in your bushes, Mr. Bastian. A car? Mr. Bryant, you still say you know nothing of Jordan's movements? There are people on the other side. They couldn't have got here already. Could they? Oh, look, a fire. What would really happen if they caught us? They're not going to catch us. Farm workers on their way to the hills. All right, then we'll cross as soon as it gets light. Only if they've gone. Wouldn't it be safe with them? I'll not be safe if I was seen by anyone, Mrs. Jordan, anyone at all. Let's eat. It's still New Year's Day. Yes, it is. A year ago today I was advised to have General Zoreno shot. You should have listened. Of course, if we were the Swiss Family Robinson, I would find the dry martini tree and we'd all have a nice stiff cocktail. Well, when in doubt have a picnic. What a sad song. Cheese. On the contrary, it is a song of happiness. But don't they care what's happening? They have seen too many changes. When I was a child, I worked at one of those farms. I had to wait on the great landlord. Wherever he went all day, I have to stand beside him with a tall glass filled with ice. One night I woke up, the dogs were barking. A man had stolen something from the big landlord and he had him half buried in the ground and the horses rode over him. They woke us up and made us watch so we would learn from his mistake. I grew up and I went away and studied, studied. And when I came back, the dogs barked again. That same landlord, he was planted in the ground and the horses rode over him. All that studying to make the dogs bark again. You know, different dogs, of course, this time. But you had no part of that? What do you want, Mr. Jordan? A good reason for saving my life? Wake up, you don't have to swim. I was dreaming about the room I booked last night at the Cosmopolitan. Single and with bath. What did you say? I said you don't have to swim. The great river just about comes up to my knees, and it's firm gravel underneath. So we can drive across. What the hell are you doing? He saw us. All right! It was a mistake. We should have silenced the boy. He saw us. If you want to come with us get in the car. Come on. We got to get out of here quick. I'll open the back. Mr. Jordan. Mr. Jordan. Tom. That's my leg, Tom. One bar of chocolate and a corkscrew and no bottles to open. Well, at least they were worth saving. You are very angry with me, Mr. Jordan. I was only trying to help. Trying to help? Not for myself, please understand. There are men, women, and children there who will be shot unless I can get out for help. And you, Mrs. Jordan, and your husband, what is one boy against so many? Perhaps it's true. Now if you think that's true, why are we doing all this? Please, let us forget about the boy. It's not so bad, Mrs. Jordan. In those hills not very far, there's a village, San Pablo. People there are still my friends I think. They would help us if we could reach them. Oh, Tom, he looks bad. He's alive, isn't he? He's breathing. What else does he expect? Let's go. Come on. Mr. Jordan, your watch. I've even lost your watch for you. Save your breath for the mountains. Come on now. We shall certainly catch them. Napier should have financed the fatherland party, Mr. Bryant. Not Rivera's escape. But we did not do either. No. I'm afraid we won't believe that, unless it's proved at Rivera's trial. And if it isn't? Napier's Plantation will be taken over for the benefit of the people. But we've given your people work, money, hospitals, and we've never indulged in politics. Then you'd better start indulging now on the winning side for a change. They must be trying to cross the frontier to Bareya. You see, we know they crossed the river. A boy was given a present, a watch with the initials TJ, Tom Jordan, perhaps? They came from here, San Pablo. No doubt he helped them. The people there are very backward. Of course, they may not have heard the good news of our revolution. I think we shall have to announce it to them in a way they can understand. Alto! Mama! That... That is San Pablo. Are they looking for us? Get in there. Come on. Do you think they saw us? I hope not. Do not be too worried, Mrs. Jordan. We are not so far from the frontier. Well, about that village? Can't we go there? We could, but... I'm afraid we might bring them trouble. Thank you. Are you very tired? Can't be far now. Can't it? What are you thinking about? How long we can live on a bar of chocolate? We'll have plenty left for tomorrow. Tom, why can't we go to that village? I could go. I mean I don't think anyone will recognize me. I mean nobody could recognize me now. I could get food. I can speak enough Spanish. I mean why not? Because it will be dangerous, that's why. Oh, Tom. Oh, you won't ever listen. Well, I'm sorry. Don't. Don't what? Apologize. I know it went all wrong after that party. It seems so long ago. No, Tom, no. I'm sorry but I really don't feel like it. I thought it might be comforting. It'll be more comforting if you could find us some food and water, or even a bed. Oh, Lord, I'm hungry. All right, then, let's go to sleep. Let's just go to sleep. Oh, no. Oh, no, I just want some food. Oh, just some food. You bloody little fool! Mr. Jordan. Mr. Jordan, please... I must rest. I remember once when my son was a little boy, I took him to a fiesta. Hundreds of Indians came to town, galloping on horses and my little boy let go off my hand and ran out among those great hooves. I called him to return, but he would not come. I was sure he would be killed. The horses passed, and there was my little boy alive and well. I ran over to him and I struck him hard. It was out of great relief and love, but my little boy could not understand that. It's gonna rain. Of course. What do you mean "of course"? This is the temple of the god of rain and fertility. We shall have a feast in his honor. Mexican enchilada, roast beef with Yorkshire pudding. Mine. Where's mine? You're busy eating it. He's eating my chocolate. He's eating my chocolate! That's mean, that's disgusting! That little piece of chocolate and now he's eating it! I've been thinking about it all day, that little piece of chocolate and now he's eating it. Please, Mrs. Jordan. Darling, this is your piece. Look at the rain, it's like England. You remember when we first arrived in England, and you were expecting to find a country full of green lawns and stately homes and tall titled men in tweed suits, making witty remarks and eating cucumber sandwiches. Hmm. You remember the first few weeks all we did was sit in the railway hotel and watch the rain, pouring down on Pennington station and not a lord came near us. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That's all right. I didn't know what happened. That's all right. It was awful. Tom? Tom? I see a cactus. I found something to eat. No, Mrs. Jordan, you first. Oh, no, no. You eat it first, please. You are always so kind. Are we anywhere near yet? That is Bareya. You would cross is the frontier. We always used to argue about it. I'll go down when it gets dark, take a look. Your husband does not approve of me, Mrs. Jordan, since the matter of the boy. No, he doesn't. He's a very pure man. Or shall I say, a man of high ideals? Tom? Is he pure? For him things have to be either right or wrong. If they are a little mixed, he is disgusted, he gets sick. He saw the good in revolution, but difficult to work within the cabinet. Did you hear anything? Women and prime ministers have to be a little complicated to survive, isn't that right? But, you know, men like your husband, they are better than us. It's well guarded, but we can do it now it's dark. Let's spread out in the woods, very thick all around. So we've done it. We saved you. Why, Mr. Jordan? That I cannot understand. Just a small private feeling. They are-- They are nice, those feelings, but they never stay private. I'm a politician, understand. In the end I may do worse for you than losing your job or your home or even your watch. Like what? I may confuse you, Mr. Jordan. We've been waiting for you, Mr. Jordan. What did he say? He says now we've found him, that's all we wanted and now we should let you go. Those are not my orders. What are your orders? To bring you to the justice of the people, all of you. A nice public trial in the sports arena? You will be allowed a trial. Can you guess the verdict? Naturally the verdict is well known. You mean, we'll be shot? So why the hell didn't you say so? Oh, I can't wait to hear the prosecutor. When's the tumbler due? The what? The track-- the transport to take us back. It's waiting on the main road. We're going to leave now. Just a minute. What about my wife? Your wife? She's been traveling for 2 days without any food. A peasant might treat a woman like that. A peasant? Yes, a stupid, brutal peasant. Senora, my name is Gomez. My family has a fine tradition of courtesy to women. All right. So your mother's a woman. Now ask my wife if she's tired. I was about to do so. There's no need for a foreigner to remind me. Are you tired, senora? I'm pregnant. If you wish to stay here the night, we will take turns to guard you. Thank you. Yes, Mr. Bryant, Rivera has been caught where I expected, here, at the frontier to Bareya. Congratulations, and thank you for letting me know so soon. That's a splendid news. For us, yes. But not for you, Mr. Bryant. What do you mean? Rivera had two companions. Wait till I see that fool Jordan. You will see him very soon. Meanwhile you will have to wait here. But I'm so sorry, I have a rather important-- I said here. What made you think of that story? What? About being pregnant. It's true. Wake up Rivera. What? Wake him up, and get ready to make a run for it. I just wanted to thank you for being so kind to my wife. There aren't many people under the circumstance who'd be so understanding. That's all right. How is your wife? Is she resting well? Oh, yes, thank you. As well as can be expected. You mustn't think I don't understand family matters. I'm married, too, you know. You are? Yes. My own wife gave me a boy just 3 months ago. Would you be interested to see a picture I've got? I'd love to. I've got it here in my wallet. Wife and baby together. Where is it? Oh, here it is. He has a fine loud voice. We believe he's been destined for the opera. Basso profondo, Ah, good. The cup that cheers, no? Tell me, you find our people good workers? First rate. Of course, we give them plenty of responsibility. But we make absolutely no distinction between the British and the... Natives? Well, of course, we don't actually call them that. Why not? We call you extranos, outsiders. And which of the natives would you trust most to run the plantation? Let me see. Well, I've got a lot of time for my assistant, Rafael Trujo. Sometimes I think he knows more about the job than I do myself. Rafael Trujo. Good. I must make a note of that name. I'm afraid you're going to find England rather cold after this, Mr. Bryant. One must be aware of sudden change of climate. They've escaped. No doubt they would have crossed the frontier by now. Jordan killed one of my men. As his chief, I'm holding you responsible. But you can't do that, I'm a British subject. Whoever you are, you can be tried as an accessory to a murder. But how do you know it's Jordan? It might be Rivera. Rivera? That failed man. Rivera... Mr. Bryant. Please sit down. I might give you and Napier's one last chance. Please. I want evidence from Jordan that Rivera killed my man. I want it clear, do you understand? No doubts about it. I want the world to know that the poor old refugee is a common criminal, stabs a young man in the dark, tries to kill a child. That poor child, a terrible story, Mr. Bryant. Then they'll have to send him back. No one is going to protest or shed tears in the sports arena. Yes. You are going to talk to Jordan, Mr. Bryant. In that way you might save your precious plantations. So you are going on a short journey. You'll be ready in half an hour. And Vidal here will keep you company. Remember, accidents can happen even in Bareya. Tom. Well, he's in a room just below us. The doctor's on his way. Oh, good. Gosh, I hope he's going to be all right. Aw. Well, he's safe anyway. Yes. But we can't keep him with us forever, can we? No, that's true. Ooh! Something's got to be done about this hair. When we get home, would you like it if I suddenly went blond? When we get home, I got to find a job. Something tells me I'm not exactly going to get a letter of congratulations at Napier's. Another job bitched up, is that what you were gonna say? No. I wasn't going to say that. Turn it off for God sake! What is it? Oh, God. What is it? What is it, darling? Tell me. Oh, Tom. Tom. The best singer, the opera, that's what he said he wanted his son to be. Showed me a picture. Oh! Oh. It's all over, Tom. It's all over now. Oh, Tom. Where's the president? No say. Where have they moved him to? No say, senor. Where is President Rivera? He was taken away in an ambulance to Santa Maria Hospital. Oh. When my wife calls down, tell her I've gone there. Yes, of course, sir. Thank you. Congratulations on your journey, Mr. Jordan. I hope you won't find it was a waste of time. Just a minute. Where are you taking him? We're trying to treat him. This is a hospital, haven't you noticed? Not a place for a political demonstration. Are you another reporter? No, I just brought him here. Now just leave him to us, will you? Just leave him to us. He was a great man, Mr. Jordan. What did you say? He was a great man, Rivera. I never really knew. Not that it will help him. What do you mean? It's only a very short flight from here to Tribulacion. But they can't send him back, he is a political refugee. A great embarrassment to the president of Bareya. Now, Mr. Jordan, I represent News International. Perhaps you would be so kind-- Oh, Jordan. Good to see you again. Come sit down, there's something I want to talk to you about. You know you've got us into a pretty bad jab. But quite frankly, and speaking off the record, I must say I feel the sneaky sort of admiration. I mean I might well have done the same thing if I found you dumped on my doorstep. You might? What do you want? Oh, it's just this. It's very simple. Keep the local boys happy and it would help if you'd sign to correct the record. It's a mere formality. Ah, the beautiful Mrs. Jordan. He wants us to correct the record. What does it say? Oh, it's just a formality to save the government's face. I suggest we get this over and go and have a good lunch on the company. You must have forgotten what a good steak looks like. "Rivera was armed with a knife and we clearly saw him approach Lieutenant Gomez and kill him." Rivera was asleep. Look, Jordan, all they want you to do is to say that he did it. Simply to clear us. No. So they can get him back. Listen to me. Do be sensible. You know, Bryant, I used to think that you were just a bowtie, and a big suit, and a fat smile put on by the wind, but you are worse. You are much worse. Why don't you go away? Go home. Stop trying to get us to lie about things that you wouldn't even understand. Mrs. Jordan, will you help us? You've got the future to think of. What are you going to do? Let him go through the world, throwing away every job he ever gets. Can't you make him see sense? Tom. He'd like to see you now, Mr. Jordan, and your wife. Well? Mr. Jordan. I'm here. You are both safe? Quite safe. Remarkable woman. Why did you do it? I don't know. Honestly, I don't know. Because I hate violence I suppose, because I can't stand the thought of men getting killed. And now... to save you, I... I killed a man. At last you understand. Please. Please forgive me for teaching you this. They won't get you back. No. I don't think so. No. Jordan, I appeal to your... Jordan, I appeal to your loyalty for the last time. All right, you're a great hero, aren't you? But what have you got? What exactly have you got?
