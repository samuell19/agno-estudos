Look, boss. De plane! De plane! Coconut salad. Puree of coconut. Coconut soup. Mixed coconut. And prime coconut roast. Hey, boss, you forgot something. You forgetting the dessert. Oh, I hate coconuts! I can't stand coconuts! We've been on this island for months. There's nothing on it but a coconut tree. I'll go nuts if I'm on this place another minute! Hey, boss. It's a minute already. It is? Wow! Ooh ho ho ho! Ooh hee hee hee! Hoo hoo! Hoo hoo hoo! Hoo hoo! Hoo hoo hoo! Hoo! Hoo hoo hoo! Hoo! Look, Daffy. Two sheeps. Two sheeps! We are saved! We are saved! Two sheeps? Two sheeps? Goody! Goody! Goody! Now we can have lamb chops. Oh, boy! Leg of lamb! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! No, it's sheeps! It's sheeps! Like on the water. Sheeps! We're saved! We're saved! Ship ahoy! Iarriba, arriba! Hey, sheeps! Here we are! Here we are! Ee-ha! Ee-ha! Ee-ha! Ee-ha! Ships ahoy there! Over here! Look! Over here on the beach. Ship ahoy! Surrender! Ahoy there! Surrender, rabbit! I've got you outnumbered one to one! Surrender? Never heard of the word. You'll have to try to take the ship. Now, he should know better than that. Blast you, rabbit! Two can play that game. Look this way, on the beach! Ahoy! Ahoy! What's the matter with you guys… you blind? This way! Ahoy there! Come on, you guys, stop horsing around and rescue us! Prepare to defend yourself, rabbit, 'cause I'm a-boarding your ship. Charge! Retreat! S-e-s! S-e-s! That's s-o-s, you jerk. O.k., s-o-s, whatever. S-o-s! S-o-s! Avast, you bad-tempered, snaggle-toothed varmint! Get on deck and load this Cannon! Arrghh! Cut out the army talk. We're in the Navy. Set her down. Set her down here. Ooh! I'll shiver his timbers, and I'll batten his hatch and keelhaul his scuppers. Now, you long-eared critter, I'm a-gonna make you pay… Oh, no! You doggone idiot galoot! You'll blow the ship to smithereenies. And if you does that once more, I ain't a-going after it. Oh, no! Hey, look, boss. One ship, she blow his top. It's the fallout! Scram! Hey! Oof! Ooh! Watch yourself. You're liable to get squashed. Holy frijoles. You squashed, boss? Methinks I've found a map. It's a treasure map. Oh, dame fortune slugged me. I'm rich! Mmm… I'm wealthy! Hoo hee! Hoo hoo hoo! I'm fabulously well heeled. Hoo hoo hoo! I'm comfortably well off. Hoo hoo! Ha ha! No more coconuts. Mrs. Mallard's little boy is now a rich duck. Ho ho! Hoo! I'll make a wonderful capitalist. Oh, boy. Boss, we going to find treasure? We'll find that treasure if you've got to dig up this whole island. Let's get started. How come I always get stuck on the end of the shovel with no gold on it? Rackin'-frackin' rabbit. I'd like to stretch him on a rackin'-brackin'- frackin' rack. Row faster, you snaggle-toothed varmint, or I'll batten down your barnacles. Slow down, you swab! You're going to capsize us! Slow down! Slow down! Slow down! Arrgh. Ptooey! Ptooey! Ptooey! Ohh, just for that, I'm a-gonna slice your hawser. Arrgh. Great thunderation! My treasure map's gone! Some sneakin' swab's run off with my treasure map. Ooh, I'll keelhaul the swab that done it. Oh, what be this? Aha! Looks like the one who's done it is wearing black feathers. Come on, you mangy wharf rat. I got me a clue. Let's see, now. This map says turn left at the swamp. I don't see any swamp. Perhaps this sign will help. "Danger… "Quick… sand… Swamp"! Well, don't just stand there. Turn left! There's feather-bearing critters in thar. Now, get in there and see if those critters are wearing black feathers. Oh, you stupid swab. There ain't a black feather among them, and you may lay to that. I keeps telling you, cut out that army talk. We're in the Navy. According to this map, the treasure's got to be buried somewhere among these rocks. These rocks? You can't miss it. There's a big black "x" marking the spot. I find him. Ee-ha! Ee-ha! Iarriba, arriba! Iandale, andale! I don't see no cross, boss, only a beat-up old well. The last thing in the world I need is a stupid well. I'm not thirsty, I'm hungry. Me, too, boss. I wish I had some cheese. I am the spirit of the wishing well. I do my best to please. The wish you made I Grant you, so here's a hunk of cheese. Hey, that spirit from the well… He give pretty good service. Stand aside, rodent. Let me at that well. Listen, well. If you can whomp up cheese for a mouse, surely you can turn me into a superduck so I can fly off this stupid island. Your fondest wish, your fondest dream, I'll make you superduck supreme. This strange being from another planet is… Faster than a bullet… More powerful than a speeding locomotive… Able to leap the tallest buildings. Heh heh. Heh heh heh. Disguised as cluck Trent, a mild-mannered reporter on a metropolitan newspaper, stupor duck fights an endless battle against the forces of… Evil. You call that superduck? You made me a stupid duck. Patience is a virtue. Patience brings good luck. It is seldom found in humans and never in a duck. Hee hee hoo ha ha! You cannot stop me, Mr. Newspaper editor. I blow up everything! Boom! Powee! Zap! Kaboom! All over country… Buildings, Bridges, power plants, trains, ships! Everywhere, ruin and destruction! Then I, aardvark ratnick, will be supreme! Ha ha ha ha ha! Blow up buildings? Bridges? Sink ships? Say, I believe this aardvark ratnick fellow is in league with the forces of evil. This looks like a job for stupor duck. Now to the broom closet to change from the guise of a mild-mannered newspaper reporter to that of stupor duck. Whoops. Wrong costume. And I, aardvark ratnick, will rule the world! Hoo ha ha ha ha! I don't know why I… Watch these corny soap operas. Where is he? Where's the cowardly little sneak? Aha! Escaped out the window, eh? Stand aside! This is a job for stupor duck! Wouldn't you think they could find some other place to put a building? That building down there! It's blowing up! Ah! The evil work of aardvark ratnick. This is a job for… Stupor duck! Ta-da! Oh, no thanks are necessary, my good man. I was just doing my duty. Then the lights went out all over the world. You call yourself a wishing well? There, in the ocean. A ship's sinking. Thank goodness I'm in time to show aardvark ratnick he's no match for… Ahh… stupor duck! All right, ratnick. Let's see you try that again. Fire one. One away, sir. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! Ooh-hoo ooh-hoo! Mother. That ratnick's a slippery one, all right. But not quite slippery enough. Aha! Planting dynamite at the base of that railroad trestle. The work of that rat ratnick, or I don't know my rats. This is a job for… Ahh… stupor duck! I'll just relieve you of that, if you don't mind. Shucks. I almost had him that time. But just let him make one false move, and I'll… This is a job for… You know who. All right, ratnick, you better make your first shot a good one, 'cause I'm coming down there and shove that oversized Cannon cracker right down your throat! Up there in the sky! It's a bird. It's a plane. It's stupor duck! It's stupor duck! Aah! Yaah! Stupid well. Ouch! Ow! Ooh! Ooh! Listen, you at the bottom of the well. As long as this island is my last resort, make it a nice resort. Your uncouth words have reached my ears. I reluctantly comply. This shabby little island I shall transmogrify. Look, boss, a mackerel is happening. You mean a miracle. Sí. Holy frijole! Look at this. It's all here, just like I wished it. Even better! There must be a way for a duck to make a buck in a place like this. Hey, you got a new suit. A zoot suit. Your suit looks nice, too. Who's your tailor? By George, I've got it! When word of this wishing well gets around, people will pour in to have their wishes come true at 500 bucks a wish. Here. Get rid of this map. Now that we've found the treasure, who needs it anymore? Hearken closely to these words. This secret I must tell. Only he who owns the map is possessor of the well. Get your filthy hands off that map, you little sneak. It's mine, do you hear? Mine! Mine! Mine! And so is the whole island! Hey, what you going to call this place, boss? What else but… Daffy duck's fantastic island! Look, boss! De plane! De plane! Where? Over there? Sí. I see. There it is… the first of many. Shall we hasten to the dock and greet our guests? Sí, let's do that. Iarriba, arriba! Iandale pronto! As the host of fantastic island, let me be the first to extend the hand of hospitality and bid you… Sheesh! $500 for a penny, folks, and cheap at the price. Yes, sir, ladies and gents, 500 big ones will get you a single, solitary penny. Plunk it into the well and watch your fondest dreams come true. My boss, he plenty smart in the cabeza. You bet. Don't shove, folks. There's enough pennies for everybody. Have your 500 bucks in your hands to save time. How many, lady? Oh, hee hee hee! Just one, please. The 500 first, lady. Oh, dearie me. Of course. I'm so absent-minded. There you are, sister. Oh, my gracious. I'm all of a Twitter. Hello, well. Hi. Go ahead. Toss your stupid penny in the well and make a stupid wish. Well… here goes. I guess I've always wanted to minister to the sufferings of humanity. I wish I was a nurse. Your wish shall be granted. Gaze into me and see. The next time that you see yourself, a nurse is what you'll be. Oh, dear. I'm so impatient to get to my first patient. I tawt… I taw… A puttytat. Great day in the morning! Instead of one, it looks like I'm going to get three. Bad old puttytat. Good morning! And how are my patients today? And how's the doggie's limb this morning? Ooh! Ooh! Ohh… still tender, eh? Well, maybe that will teach you to stop chasing the pussycat. And how's the… Pussyfoot today? Oh! Oh! Oh! Still sensitive? Maybe now you'll leave that little birdie alone. I hope this teaches both of you a lesson. Oh, the poor little tweety bird. Let's make you a little more comfortable. Now, you be good boys and get some rest. Uh-oh. I don't like the look in that puttytat's eyes. Ahh, shut up! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! What's going on in there? My, I must be hearing things. Didn't I tell you to shut up? Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My, my. You must be in terrible pain. We'll get you back into bed and give you something to make you sleep. Ooh! There, now. It'll be more quiet here. Those pills will put you to sleep in a few minutes. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Where did that puttytat go? He nowhere around. I better peek in and see how little tweety bird is doing. Aah! Bad old puttytat. O.k., buster, you asked for it. Ooh hoo hoo! Ow! Ooh! Ah! Ah! Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ah! Ow! Ooh! Ah! You two at it again? I'll just have to strap you both in bed. Now stop sulking. Why don't you get a hobby like the pussycat? When you two decide to behave, I'll unstrap you. Whoa-ho-ho-ho! I've got good news, boys. Your x-rays show nothing is wrong with you, and you're dismissed. Isn't that wonderful? Gee, it feels good to be out again. Uh-oh. Que sera sera. You simply must stop playing in the street. You're running out of legs. There you are, sir. I'm gonna wish a certain rooster into a lot of creative trouble… Trouble, that is. I say, wishin' well, you listening? I hear you. State your wish. Drop in your penny or go fish. Here it is. There's this rooster I wants to put the kibosh on. Little fella… he's took over my chicken yard, cornered the market on hens, and made my life… I say, made my life… He gave me a complex… Inferior, that is. You want to drop that penny? I don't wish the boy any permanent harm. I just want the cockiness… I say, the cockiness knocked out of him. I am here to Grant your wish, the spirit of the well. I will knock the cockiness out of that little cockerel. If that's who I think it is, there's a certain banty rooster that's gonna get booted over the horizon. Get out and stay out!

What do you take, heads or tails? Aah! You beast! You cannibal! How could you? Mouse or no mouse, he's your son. A fine thing. I've become the father of a breakfast. Hold still, you little rodent.

And now daddy is going to take his widdle man for a walk. Cootchie cootchie coo. Good day, sir. I represent the little giant vacuum cleaner company of walla walla, Washington. Notice this machine removes completely all foreign particles from the room. You may not be ready to purchase now, but if you ever do, remember the little giant vacuum cleaner. Cannibals. I understand you need a babysitter. Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! Ho ho ho! Ho, dancer, ho, prancer. Merry Christmas, everybody! Ho ho ho! A jolly yuletide. Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, everyone! Ho ho ho! A merry… What a fuss they made at the office. I got to get the mouse to his real parents. Cheese! Don't touch that! Those darn cats! Still at it. I'll show them. Boy! Did that mouse grow! Well, nothing like this ever happened on my side of the family. Your mind is such a simple thing, your wish I can foretell. You're wishing for a husband and the ring of a wedding bell. Yes. Oh, if it isn't prissy. Yes. Oh, prissy, you don't know how lucky you are never to have had children. They're such a trial. Hee hee hee! That always burns her up. Hee hee hee! You know, junior scratched a little today for the first time. Wonderful! He'll be crowing next thing you know. Don't touch my child! What, the very idea! The nerve of her! Why doesn't she have her own children? Oh, my dear, she'd never land a man. She's too much of a d-r-i-p, if you know what I mean. Hey, Hazel. Look who's going to look for a husband. Not prissy? Oh, ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Yeah, ol' square britches herself. The poor old thing couldn't catch a husband with a bear trap. Girls, here she comes. Happy husband hunting, dearie. Did you take something to clunk him on the head? Yes. Aah! Now, who's respon… I say, who's responsible for this unwarranted attack on my person? Aha! 'Course, you know this means war. Ahh! Huh? Now, what have we got here? All right, sister, out with it. Let's have it. What, I say, what's the big idea bashing me on the noggin with a rolling pin? Clunk enough people and we'll have a nation of lumpheads. Now, hold on. That was a joke, girl. Lump heads… Lumpheads. Nothing to cry about. Let's hear your side of the story. Well… I know just what you're going to say. You're looking for a husband. Yes. You're going about it all wrong. You don't bat them on the bean with a rolling pin. That's later. Now, you take that rooster yonder… He's a fine bachelor rooster. But, uh… Uh-uh! You're right! He does look like a dog, but he's a rooster, all right. He just wears that dog suit to keep lovesick hens away from him. Oh! Now, here's how to get him. Everybody, I say, everybody knows the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Take this fine casaba melon over to him. Show him what you got, but don't let him have it. Tease him a little. Make him chase you. Is any of this filtering through that little blue bonnet of yours? Yes. Nice but sharp as a sack of wet mice. Psst! For me? This cluck's off her onion. All right, salome. Give papa the pretty melon. Give me that casaba, you peabrain! Oh! He's chasing me. I'm wide, I say, I'm wide open! Shoot me a lateral. That's it. That's the old passing it, kiddo. Your rooster, girlie. I've hooked, I say, I've hooked him. It's up to you to land him. Sooner or later, she's bound to try to get him out of that dog suit. Then whoa, Nellie! Hey, wait a minute. What are you trying to do, pull the skin off of me? Yes. Well, it won't work, girlie. It's on too tight. Now, what's this all about? Well… Look, chick, I got news for you. What you want's a rooster, not a dog, which I am. Yes! With that puss, your only chance to get a rooster is to trap one. Here's how you go about building a trap. You get yourself a couple of 2 x 4s. Then you get a stepladder… What in the, I say, what in the world is that hen up to now? I don't know what you're doing with that bowling ball, girlie, but I'm not one to let a lady do a man's job. There you are, sister. Have fun. Nutty as a fruitcake. Going on your honeymoon? Yes. Yes! I say, yes! I wonder what them varmints is doing round that old well? I'll sashay down there and find out. Move aside! Make way for a pirate. Hey, varmint, what in tarnation's going on here? For 500 simoleons, I'll give you a penny. Drop it in the well and make a wish. Your wish will come true. Fork over the cash. You're holding up the line. Fork over one of them pennies, or I'll cut you off at the pass. Yes, sir. You talked me into it. All right, you dumb well. I've always wanted to have a rich relative who'd kicked the bucket and left all his money to me, so let's have it! A very rich relative in poor health doth will to you his entire wealth. But, sire, there is no more money. Your uncle the king has cut off your allowance. You know the penalty for not having the books balanced. Oh, no! Not the nose in the book penalty. Yeah, the nose in the book. We got to get some money! Ooh! Well, what do you want? Good evening. My company has selected you, under no obligation, to be the proud owner of legal tender amounting to… We don't want any! £1 million! A million pounds? Well… Come right in. Welcome to the house of Sam. "To make certain this money be received "by a worthy person of mild temperament, "the bearer of the document"… That's me… "has been authorized to deduct "from the total amount any sum he sees fit whenever there's any display of temper." In short, whenever you blow your top, you blow some dough. Get it? Proceed. Allow me to be your most humble and mild-tempered host. Oh, uh, Sam! Pass the salt, please! Salt? Get it yourself! Uh-oh. That'll cost you about, uh… Salt? Why didn't you say so? Here's your salt, bunny. I hope you like it. Oh, uh… The pepper, please. Pepper! Oh, uh… Yeah, hee hee. The pepper. Coming right up. Put a room across… Oh, Sam! Oh, no. How about the olives? Aah… That dirty pera-alta bak-a-flappin' filabustin' gloom-a-burtin… Now, what was that you were saying? I like you, rabbit. I heard you in there. It'll cost you £300. £300! 400. Ooh! Eh, I'm not sleepy. I'll hang around a while. Good night, Sam. Nighty-night, bunny. ♪ I dream of Jeannie ♪ ♪ She's a light brown hare ♪ ♪ Ia te de da ♪ ♪ Da da da de ta ta de ♪ Stop that music, you crazy rockin' varmint rabbit! Well, that should be worth £400. Hee hee! I was only kidding. How about singing me to sleep with that brahm's lullaby? What do you say, Frankie boy? Well, maybe. ♪ Da da da dum ♪ ♪ Ta da da da da ♪ ♪ Ta dum ta da ♪ Do you like it? I like it. I like it. ♪ Ia da di do do do ♪ ♪ Ia do di di ♪ Get out of there! Hey, you splatter-spattin' NASA-trapperall! I heard you. It's going to cost you £400. Oh! And 35 shillings. Ooh! Hey, doc, what's that song you're playing? I like it. Dirty… If this keeps up, I won't have anything left. I'll get rid of him. It'll look like an accident. Oh, Mr. Bunny! There's someone at the door for you. Tell him to come back tomorrow. I'll be here all day. What? Oh, no, you're not! You're coming out right now! Out, out, out! O.k., Sam, it's all yours. Why, you… Whew! The alps have got nothing on these stairs for climbing. Oop! I got it licked, rabbit. I don't get mad no more. Watch this. See? Ha ha ha! I can take it. I haven't the heart to tell him he's used up all the money. Ooh, I hates wishing Wells. See here, my good fellow, you're creating a bottleneck in the line. Oh, yeah? Seaweed Sam don't take that kind of talk from no fancy pants! Yikes! You've unpanted me. Feel a draft, varmint? Ha ha ha! Wretch. Have you no couth? Great horny-toads. It fits. So you're the map-stealing varmint who done run off with my treasure map. Well, you got three seconds to cough it up before I stunt your growth. To have my weakness exposed in front of all these people. What if I am a coward? At least I'm a live coward. Take the map. Now to find the treasure. Let's see now… "Walk 10 paces north, northeast. 1… 2… 3… 4, 5, 6, 7… 8, 9… 10. Iarriba, arriba, arriba! Iarriba! Iandele! Ouch! Out, infidel. Pollute not my wholesome well. Iarriba, arriba, arriba! Iarriba! Iandele! Well, get out of my way! I'll catch that rodent varmint. The only two things a pirate will run for is money and public office. Iarriba! Iandele! Oops! I got it! I got it! I got it! Slow down, you cantankerous cuss! Let go of my map, you duck-billed platypus! Hey, boss, watch out for the volcano! Hot rocks! You'll get hot foots! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Aah! Ooh! Yeow! Yeow! Now look what you done, you flea-brained varmint! You ruined my map! Map? Only he who holds the map is possessor of the well. The island's changing back to what it was! Maybe that stupid well's got one more wish left in it. I suspect not. How about just one teensy-weensy wish? Just one? There are some wishes in the well. In truth, they number three. Use these three wishes wisely, friends, for they are the last there will be. Did you hear that, fellas? The well has graciously consented to give us three more wishes. Isn't that swell? Imarvelousomente! You could wish for E.T. To get home. Three wishes. That's one apiece. Speedy can wish the first one, me the second, Sam the third. Listen. My stomach she is grumbling. I wish I had a big fat burrito. I never saw a burrito that looked so good like this. How can you make a stupid wish like that? I wish that burrito would stick on your dumb nose. Frijole! What are you doing? Take him off quick! I can't breathe nothing but burrito! Well, Sam, there's only one thing to do. Use that third wish to get that burrito off his nose. It's the only humane thing to do. Don't you think so, Sam? Sam? Sam! Too late, duck. I already wished for a pirate ship. After I sinks a certain pesky rabbit, I'll come back and pick you up! Ooh, you're despicable! And now I say, without the jokes…
