Come on, men! Foward! BEAUTY AND THE BEAST What's the matter, my Dicker? We'll be home soon. Is someone there? Is anyone there? Oh my goodness. Come on, my Dicker. Are you crazy? You ride like the devil! -- There were two royal children -- -- they loved each other dearly... -- Elsa, the sheperds ask to write the debt again. This is not paradise, we have no money ourselves. Your father always let us write the debt. Im not my father. We?ll pay tomorrow. My father returned. Here, my dear! Father! My princess! You arrived just in time. The sheperds don?t want to pay again! Greetings! God Be with you! Thank you! They have lost many sheeps this week. It hasn?t been easy for them. Not for us either! Father, what happened to the barrels? The knight of Hohentauen and his people were ridding and hunting. We were pushed off the road. But nothing happened to us, little Dicker. Nothing happend? All the wine is lost. No, no, a barrel remained intact. That?s not enough! We'll think of something. Here, this is for you. You're never worried about anything, eh? Why should I? I am blessed with the best daughter of all. Stretched with fresh spring water that's how a drop is gets really big. Still tastes good. And it?s healthier. Hopefully they will not join us. Greetings Wine for the Lord of Hohentauen and his men! My Lord... Stay! What is your name, pretty girl? Elsa. Beautiful. Like that Rose. Thank you, my Lord. Say, Elsa, do you want to accompany me to the tournament in the city on St James? As my lady? And wear my coat of arms? Me? You? A token of my favor. Oh... Who will pay the bill? The bill? You owe the lease for a year, including interest. Apart from stretching wine with water! If His Lordship would?t hit me... What do you mean by that? Nothing, sir, nothing. Be generous, Vogt! Our hunting was successfull. And what did you say? Oh. Yes, oh. You said oh? At least you said something. A real knight. Im I correct? The knight of Hohentauen wants to go to the tournament with you? Do not worry, I wont go. I will not leave you alone. Well, think of yourself. My daughter, a tournament lady. Stop that! I don?t even have anything to wear. I will probably appear bad at a tournament... Then we?ll buy you something new. And with what? We have no money for wine and can not even pay the lease. We pawn something. We've already pawned everything. In case of emergency we will pawn your mother's jewelry. There are things in the box... You want to pawn her jewelry? Temporarily. The only thing we still have from her? Satsel? Satsel? I?ve been thinking. What? This will be enough for the lease and more wine. For a new dress and shoes. Shoes made of the finest leather and a dress made of the purest silk! You dreamer! The necklace doesn?t worth that much. You?ll bewitch everyone! The knights, the singers, the whole court. We?ll get the nacklace back. Everyone?ll pass here to go to the tournament. They?ll be hungry and thirsty. We?ll earn a lot of money. Don?t worry, everything will be fine. And don?t buy new clothes, I?ll sew my old ones. I know what I'm doing. Just bring me a rose again. You'll get that anyway. See you tonight. Come on. It's alright. Brass and glass. No gold or gems? I'd really like to help you, but see for yourself. Since the good king died long ago, the armed knights do as they please with the tournaments and spectacles while the people suffered need. I can?t give you more than a few cruisers. I can?t do anymore for you. Taste it. Heck, hell! That's water. From the best source. At least she's in a better mood again. Should I say why? Today is payday. So, you do have money. We sold our herd. I'm sorry. The wolves in the area just tore too many sheep. Wolves? There are no wolves here. You Better stay away from the forest It?s not safe there. You know, Dicker, five cruisers are better than nothing. You know when a door closes, another is open. My God, what is this fog? Is getting denser. Hey! Stand still! You stupid animal, wait! Dicker! Come back! Stupid animal... Dicker! Dicker, are you there? Hello? Is anyone there? For heaven?s sake. Is that a castle? Greetings, good people! It's just me, Hugo, the innkeeper of the inn in the valley. I need a place to stay. Please, I'm getting cold. Or something. Well then, good night. Father? Father? Father! Well then, thank you for the hospitality. And for the soft bed and the warm bath. Oh, and for the good breakfast, thank you! What else can you expect from such fine people as you? Thank you for the flower. You?ve stolen from me !! But it's just a rose! My Rose! Let me live, I give you everything I have! A life for a life! Don?t kill me please. I ... You?ll give me the first life that you encounter, when you go back home. Do you understand? The first living thing that meets you at home. Agreed! Let me down now! Poor Satsel... Take the horse. If you don?t keep your word, I'll find you and kill you. I am sorry! Poor Satsel... Father! No! Nooo!!! Thank God! You?re alive! I searched you all night! Now everything is fine again. Is that horse yours? Did you get that much money for the necklace? Where is the dog?! What are you talking about? We have to flee, right now! He kills me if I do not keep my word. Fast! We must pack our things! Come on! That monster has tricked me! What are you talking about? Are you drunk? I picked one of his roses. Now He required that i pay with my life. Or yours. And he wants an escape goat? For plucking a rose? It's a monster, don?t you understand? Bind the horse, tight! When he gallops back, we'll be crazy! This stallion knows the way here! That's ridiculous! Who is this lord of the castle and where is this castle? I don?t know, in the woods. I saw it there for the first time. I have not achieved anything in the city. The pawnbroker only gave me 5 cruisers for the chain. I am not only a coward, but also a failure. Nonsense. I'm so sorry. You deserve better. Satsel, now you can escape with us. We?ll make up for it. Ten horses will not bring me back to that castle! You do not have to go back, I'll take care of it. What?! Elsa, come down here immediately! I'll just bring him the rose and all be well! Elsa! Come back! He will kill you! Elsa! Is someone there? I just want to make emends for my father?s error. Is anyone home? Who is there? She?s actually here! Are you the Lord of the castle? Welcome, My Lady. God be with you. I am Elsa. The innkeeper's daughter from the Valley. My name is Wenzel. And mine is Irmel. Can I speak to your Lord? It's about a rose, that my father accidentally... He's already waiting for you in the Great Hall. It?s down this hall. And do not be frightned... Is anyone there? I wanted to apologize on behalf of my father for doing that. Who is there? Please don?t ! You are finally here. No, no! You smell good. Please don?t kill me. I?ve bring them from my mother?s grave, i?m sorry. Here's a rose, like yours. I plant them and That?s not my rose! Please, let me go! You?ll become my wife. What?! Give me a kiss! No! You are mine, forever! Quick!!! Oh, no! She's not... Take care of her! Didn?t I say she shouldn?t be frightned? How could she not be scared? You stupid donkey! And what do we do with her? Next. Only 2 out of 3 chickens? Next. Good Lord! Gracious Lord! Help a defenseless father! My daughter has been kidnapped! By a monster!! By The Lord of the castle in the forest. Vogt! Ah, the innkeeper from the valley. Are you here to pay your debts? Instead of that, he dares to ask for our help. I implore you, you know my daughter Elsa. She wants to be your tournament lady. Where is that castle? In the woods! Half way to the city, please, it's my daughter life! From Arbo to Hohentauen, all fortresses are mine. No, you're wrong, those are not the one's. Old man, do not talk nonsense, pay your debts. You know exactly what happens to people who do not pay their debts. I'll save her alone. She lives! She lives! Thank God! Where am I? Oh, at home. Language, Wenzel! You do not adress a lady that way... True, yes, I completely forgot! And the beast? The beast...The Lord? He is also at home. Where is he? Far far away... He will not come in here. He has never been in here. This is the Queen?s wing and he's in the King?s wing. This must be a nightmare. We have to stop her! Why me? Because she is running away! Time is running out for us! Come back, please! Where are you going? Where are you? Not in the basement! You can not go there! Let me go. No! Why? Your father gave me his word. You're mine now, Elsa. No never! Watch it! Carefull! Don?t you like it bloody? I'm not hungry. Not hungry? People in captivity are not hungry. Eat! I want to go to my room. Watch her. My Lady? Are you alright? Well? Don?t get it wrong, he has not had a guest for a long time Not for many years. He can be... different. He was a real... Psst! We can not tell her that! - True Here is the rout. It must be somewhere here, Satsel. Elsa! Elsa! Come, Satsel. It must be around here, I don?t understand. Elsa! I don?t hear anything. She?s probably asleep. It was a busy day... Did you hear that? Of course! She?s having a nightmare. No wonder... Let go of me! She escaped! No, she didn?t... Lucky us. Leave me alone! You could have died. Better dead, than buried alive. I'll make you a suggestion. What kind? I?ll give you your freedom...if you give some time to get to know me. Until st James. Maybe then you would like to be my wife. Never! And besides, my father needs me. He will never be able to pay his debts without my help. If you stay, he will be a rich man. And when I go? Then I'll give you so much gold, that you?ll never have need again. How can I trust a beast? Let your heart decide. Thank you for catching me. What happend? I did not find her. I was right there, but nothing. No, certainly no castle. You have a fever! To bed with you, quick, i'll get the Doctor. No I can't pay. Then I'll make you a stuffed cabbage for the fever. Let fresh air in. Fresh air, very well. Would it hurt if you freshen up too? Only a little bit. What do you mean by that? Nothing. Everything. You know. We need food, something she will eat. A soup, maybe! And fresh bread. Bread, soup. Well, do that! We? I'm a squire. And I a maid. We are really sorry, but You know what happends to me when she goes! Clear! Of course! I hope you also know what happens to you then? Of course! Then make an effort! A soup. We need a pot for that! Where is it again? Not so fast! I need clean clothes. Clean clothes, coming right away! Quick, you ass, the soup is burning, stir! Go!! My lady? The food is ready. Alright. It looks much better. Just missing some pictures on the walls... Oh, Wenzel! It was just an idea... Where is she? Just be patient, a lady just needs time to get My Lady. I hope you have slept well. And? Is it boar again? Soup for me, too. Yes, my Lord. Do you like the clothes in the chest? Yes, they are beautiful Why aren?t you wearing jewelry? My jewelry is in the pawnbroker in town. The one in the box is yours, take what you want. They have no meaning for me. The jewelry at the pawnbroker means something to you. The paintings of the king and queen in the basement... Who are they? Forgotten And that pretty young man, who is that, a prince? Did he lived in... What is your question? Could it be that you have something... You think I killed them! I lost my appetite. It won?t work like that. It will only get worse. Then we have to tell her what's at stake. We can not tell her anything. Try to tell her but without saying anything. Tell her yourself, without saying anything! What's going on, what do they have? The roses? They are as old as this castle, as old as everything here. When they die, we also die... All of you will die? But why? Because of the curse, the roses... What kind of curse? When the last flower fells, we are all dead. I mean, dead dead. Unless you I? What do I have to do with it? The only way that can be undone... is undone it. I do not understand a word. I can not. Say it with out saying anything. I?m hearing! He's just worried about the roses. Yes, poor roses. What can?t you tell me? Anyway, what happened to you? That's simple, that's happens when you listen behind doors. Be quiet, you nosy woman. She stucked her nose in every pot! And the master of the house? Oh that - He should tell you that himself. Where can I find him? He?s away from home. Don?t you want to wait until he's back? What for? I'll just take a look around here. You were suppose to clean this ages ago! Why me? WE! The Rose Coat of Arms. Someone smashed the Holy Mother.. My goodness! Who owns it? Prince Arbo, of course. Prince Arbo? He has not lived for a long time, and now it's over! If the Lord find out ... It's closed, come back tomorrow. Show me your jewelry! Don?t hurt me, I am an honest man. What do you want for it? Nothing, just let me live. So much gold for a bit of brass and glass. You can not go in there, that's his room. Oh, how interesting. Please don?t! We?ll get in trouble! Do you want to see the library instead? There is a library here? Follow me. Did the books also belong to the prince? No. Yes. Everything here belongs to our Lord. Why does a beast need books? If only I could read... May I? Wenzel! You can read? "Nightingale, I hear you sing." "My heart wants to shatter out of my body." "Come and tell me soon how to behave." "Nightingale, where is good living?" "On the linden trees, in the crowns." "Where is my lovely Lady, Nightingale." "Say hello to My lady a thousand times" "The rich and the lands are subjected to me." "Whenever I'm with the one I the love." "And if I leave, then" "my power and my wealth are gone." " Only longing and sorrow then count as my possessions". Please keep reading. That?s not your handkerchief! Who does it belong to? A pledge of a knight. He wants to go to the tournament in town with me. And you want to go with him? Of course. And...Is He good looking? Absolutely. Mother's necklace... Why me? You should pluck the weeds. No, you pluck the weeds and I'll pluck the herbs for the soup. I pour. Where is he? Is he in his room? He sleeps during the day and hunts at night. I only planted them yesterday. It were the snails, those villains. Snails don?t go to the roses. We can?t say anything, even if we try to say something. I have to talk to him. You must not go in there. Try to stop me. Wenzel, do something! Go away, leave me alone. You gave me a great joy. You can not imagine what this necklace means to me, How did you find it? I have a good nose. Thank you very much. It comes from my mother, It is the only thing left to me of my mother. She died when I was born. That's why I swore to work and help my father. And never to marry. To make it good again. Without me, my mother would still be alive. You are not to blame for her death. Your mother did not die because of you, but for you. For her child, out of love, that you may live. Do you think? I've never think of it like that before. Light has to come in here. No! Don?t! The crown, the sceptre, they are in the King?s painting. So, you have killed him. The Queen and the prince too. Maybe the prince did not deserve better! What ever has happend in this castle... No, you did not kill them. You may look like a beast, but you have a good heart. -- There were two royal children -- -- they loved each other dearly... -- -- They could not come together, the water was too deep.-- -- The water was too deep..-- -- Oh dear, you could swim, -- -- You could swim over to me I will light three candles. -- -- They should give light unto thee.-- A beautiful song. A sad song. This used to be one of the most respected residences. Here lived a King and a Queen. They ruled righteously and in peace. As the sign of the roses, they shared everything they had with the poor. From all countries, the knights came here. To measure their power in fight and song. How beautiful that must have been then. Then, what happened ? Tomorrow is Saint James. Already? Let's celebrate a party tonight. Then I will tell you everything. Bring everything we have. If she does not say yes tonight, everything was in vain! Come on, move! Here, this will do you good. No, I can?t. But you must eat something. Gertrud. Here, take the 3 cruisers. You still owe me the pay for the last 3 months. I know. But you see, that's all I have. Go and find yourself a better master. The master is ill, we are closed! I'm coming to get the pending lease! Feel sorry, please! He has a fever, his heart is broken. Grab him! A moment. You smell good. You are so beautiful. And me? You look gorgeous. The lord of the castle and the lady of the forest. For a special ocasion: mead-honey wine in the drinking horn. Stone bread crumbs with lard. River pike soup. Wild Gras with Cherry sauce. Chicken in spicy sauce with grain. And for the crowning glory: Lard cake with Blackberry Oh, they're still in the kitchen. You hung up the paintings again. These are not your roses? You promised to tell me what happened. One day the Queen died. The King followed her to the grave. And Prince Arbo broke with all the good traditions. Plundering, he moved through the country and celebrated intoxicating festivals. Wealth and pleasure should replace his father and mother. He wanted to forget his pain. Then plunged his people in abject poverty. What has become of him? An old man, whom the prince had taken the last possession, has cursed him. He would die. And with him the whole clan of the Arbonen. Together with their roses. So that's the curse. And, as what was said, the prince died shortly after. Unloved, unredeemed. May we serve the Lard cake now? Later, it's time to dance. Elsa? Will you be my wife? We had an agreement. I am allowed to go when Saint James comes. And that's tomorrow. I am sorry. I can not do this. The lard cake... It fell. Help! You're bleeding! I'll take you home! No! You?ll not! I Iove you Elsa. Here. this is for you. Go home, be happy. But... Then i?ll be too! Run! Go! Run!! Satsel? Father? Father! Father! Elsa! You?re alive! Praise God! Leave him! Why? He is pilloried. Father! Who ordered this? Hands off! I said, keep away He is my father, release him immediately! Then he has to pay his debt. Is that enough? Where did you get that? That?s is none of your business. Release him. You're wearing her necklace. How did you retrieve it? I'll tell you everything, first you have to regain your strength. Forgive me. I do not have to forgive you for that. At first it was a little rough. But then, the lord of the castle treated me well. He read to me, picked flowers. And he saved my life. Are you talking about the monster? He may look a bit strange, but he has a heart of gold. And he is so full of power and tenderness. Oh god, my child. Thank God you are back home. He has confused your senses. Yes, perhaps. We're getting on our feet again, both of us. I'll take care of you, I promise. With that dress you can be sure to attend the tournament. Now everything is over. Does this mean we're next? Yes. I'm sorry that I called you stupid ass. And I'm sorry I called you nosy. -- The water was too deep. -- Gertrud! Good that you are here. Will you stay? My dad can pay you now. Yes, of course! Tell him I have to leave for a few days. You can not leave now, tomorrow is the tournament. I'm not going to the tournament. No? But where are you going? There you are again. Lord of Hohentauen!! You look different, but still very charming. I?ll have a magnificient Lady at my side. I'm not going with you. Here?s your handkerchief. Why so angry? How could you put my sick father in the pillory? My servant Vogt did his duty. Where are you going? To your new patron? As I have learned, he has made you a rich woman. But with stolen gold from the crown jewels of the Arbonen. Your patron is nothing but a vile thief. He is not a thief. No? Then, where did he get all this wealth? Who is he? He is a true knight. After her! Don?t let her escape! Damn! We lost her! No! No! Please, don?t! You can not leave me now! Please do not leave me! No! I love you too. Who are you? Prince ... Arbo. You are.. The Beast. I?m he, who the old man cursed. He turned me into a wild animal. And was what I was for long, an evil beast. Without the last roses, I would have died in the dirt. If love had not saved me. Only love. Your love. Do we live? We are still alive. Look at that one. Quickly, my sword! You can?t fight him, your still hurt! This is not a fair fight. You?ld better get out of the way. Do not dare. I am Arbo, rightful king and heir of this empire. You are lying! Stick to the rules! I do not know any rules! Here, my lord! Surrender? I thought you were all dead. Pardon me, you are truly my master. Then, I'll spare your life. Watch out! In the name of King Arbo: Surrender! Elsa! Father! Gracious Lord. It is not you who has to kneel. It's me. I have brought great sorrow to the land of my fathers. Please do not, my Lord. Please get up right away. May I ask for your daughter's hand? May he? Yes, him and no one else. Cheers to the bride and groom! Everything looks so different. You look different too. You too. It was about time. Where are they coming from? It?s like a fairytale! Subtitles by: Lucile_7
