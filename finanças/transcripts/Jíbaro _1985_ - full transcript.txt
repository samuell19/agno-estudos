Escambray Mountains 1960 The last time I saw that white bitch we were hunting up there. There were 7 males and her. The boys ran after them. They ate around 12 sheep. Catch. I filled these cartridges, you won't even have to aim. You never change. We haven't gone hunting for a long time. Folks just don't care about the wild dogs. They should. They should. Come on. We may find the famous Manacal bitch. That dog's waiting for me, you can't catch her easily. Hurry up if you want to catch her and go looking for another job. How'd you arrange things with Felo? It's all set. There's plenty of rum for all of you. Well, let's get going. We're losing time. Felito, my son, keep your eyes open and you'll see real hunting. OK, but at noon I have to report to the regiment. Gentlemen, later'll be too late. Let's go. What's the matter? Lost the track? The matches. Got any? No. I left everything in the jeep. Will we catch anything? If not, my dad'll be sore. Your dad is the best hunter hereabouts. though he's getting old, just like me. I don't mind if he keeps hunting that dog. I don't even know if it exists but you have to pursue something in life. Nothing falls from heaven. I think your dad's going through a phase when he has to look around him more. Listen, there it is! Surprised you, Felo? How much meat has it eaten? Are you going to spend all day just looking? This isn't the first time you've seen a dog's guts. Look at that. They came to eat my flock out look how things turned out. Hey, did you hear about Porfirio? When'll we go hunting in the Manacal lowlands? Never, if the weather's like this. You're very pessimistic. You don't say! Look, all the plants are loaded with coffee. There's nobody to pick it. But they're around for other things. Where're those people you're talking about? Look, we know about Porfirio and the others in the 2nd Front. Some people think they have to keep rebelling. The people are upset. Naturally. Don't give me that shit. Some of them just want to coast on past glory. Everybody wants to be commander in chief. The tough ones like Porfirio are up there ... though some people want to deny it. You know that. And you do, too, Felo. Hell, let's drop it and talk about hunting or women. Come on, Nando. I'm losing this game. Hey, Severiano, that girt's a wild one. I'm crazy about her. I tell her, "Come here, girl. You're like the famous Manacal bitch." She's pretty, pretty.... Watch out, old dogs' teeth start to fall out. What the hell do you mean? I've got all my teeth. Don't get mad, Felo. I'm on a fresh trail, too, just around that bend. Goddamn! My trail leads there, too. That girl has thighs like this, like Spanish hams. Yeah? My girl's eyelashes are as long as palm leaves. I saw that girl's eyes. They're the color of new crass or cane shoots, and her eyelashes... What a coincidence! You dog! Pirate! Lazy! That's why I have to keep you tied up. Starting clearing up, it's getting late. You're aim's not bad in this, dammit. The worst fisherman sometimes gets a fish. Tonight, here in Aguada de Miranda, in the heart of the Escambray, the Agrarian Reform's giving a big dance. beer courtesy of the Fuente brothers. I'm glad to see you without your dogs. I wanted to drop by. You're always welcome. My dad's always talking about you and Severiano and hunting. Stories are better closer to the source. That's what I say. Calling Pancho Vega with the flags. Arminda, let's go. The cart will leave without us. How are you? All spruced up! Excuse us, but we're late. I'll see you at home or at the party. - Bye! - See you. Severiano! Come on over here, buddy! Don't tell me you can't stop thinking about dogs and hunting. Comrades: the music's will continue. Right now, I'd like to make an announcement. We know you're all going to be very happy, drinking beer... I want to go! I want to go! All right, already. Go on, then. And here we have a fantastic orchestra: The Los Justos Group! Excuse me. Would you do me the honor? Can't he wait for the music to begin? Yes, after this part of the program. it's very important. I'm familiar with the Seizure of Aguada. I was a guide during the war, - when... - Arminda! You're wilder than the Manacal bitch. the Rural Guard Garrison was caught in a cross fire by the troops of Eliseo Peñaranda, affectionately known as Captain Aguada, and another group on the highway... That was Porfirio Ramirez's. ... and Captain Nando Cardoso, our comrade and neighbor, who's with us tonight. Here's Severiano. He hasn't gone hunting for a long time but it looks like he is after something now. It seems we're on the same path. It's narrow and we keep on bumping into each other. Well, if we're bumping into each other and the path is narrow, one of us has to get off the path. And, in that case... Just one more thing: let evil tongues say what they want... right here, tomorrow we're going to create the framers' militia. Go roll cigarettes, Severiano. This one's too much woman for you. That wars what we wanted to announce here today: what things'll be like when we begin to apply the Agrarian Reform. Comrades! Hey! Let me talk to him, dammit! Let me talk to him. That's enough, Felo! For shame, Severiano! He's gonna pay for it! He's gonna pay! Now, you who are here: Platoon, attention! Militiaman, tuck your tummy in. Put your heels together, What's your name? Jesús de la Caridad Cobas Osés. I'm Remigio Aguinaldo Cobas's cousin. Whose cousin? My cousin's. We're cousins from Hondones Nuevos. That's great. militiaman Jesús de la Caridad. You mustn't smoke when in formation and your gun has to be pointed up. Put your heels together and hold it... hold it! Sergeant, may I join ranks? Militiaman Federico Curbelo, don't you know you have to come on time? You know I have a son in the army. He's in the Santa Clara regiment. He's a very serious boy. And the path's very bad. OK. You want us to report your lateness to your son. What do you think: shall we report him to his son? Oh, militiaman Federico Curbelo! OK, this is the first time so It's OK. Join ranks. Hey! Here at the end. Hey! You belong here! Comrade, is he Felo the famous hunter? You have to change eyes to aim. What's so funny? Cut it out! Platoon, attention! Hey! Eliseo Peñaranda, Captain Aguada himself! Nando. You were a great one in the war. - It's been a long time. - That's right. Not all of us captains are equal now. Dammit, Nando, don't say that. We all change. These are my boys. Remember I used to tell you about them? My, but they've grown! What's keeping you busy? Nothing. I left the service. Asked for a leave. I wanted to grow coffee. And now? One day I visit friends, another, I go hunting, and the rest, just waiting. Hell, man, you've got to do something. You won't have any problems. How about a drink? The comrades are invited too. No, I have to keep going. Another day. I have to inspect a militia troop. Another day I'll take you up on it. You mean those clods marching around? You're mixed up with them? They've never even held a Garand. But now everybody's going to have one. Where were they when we were fighting? The same place we were before we joined up. Attention! Attention! Militiamen from Manacal, go to the baseball field. Platoon, attention! Right face! The cigar... How goes it? Aren't you from Añil? Yes. I thought I recognized you. - How are you, OK? - Fine, boy. First class. This is going to be a good group. For sure, it'll be a good group. The famous Captain Aguada. Shit, man! For you, everybody's famous. This will be a battalion of mountain militiamen. Soon, we'll all go on operations ... or, if not all, at least some of you will. This battalion will be famous in the Escambray. Some may not trust you but you'll be famous. I guarantee it. And soon there'll be weapons for all of you and boots and uniforms, and we'll all defend this Revolution. When we're separated, scattered through the hills, we're weak, but together, united, we're like a fist against the counterrevolutionaries. You'll do it. Militiamen, break ranks! Hey, Felo, excuse me for bothering you. I'm from Los Hondones. We wanted to send you a message: there's a wild dog there who's killing our sheep. We need your help. Well, I don't know... Nando, the Galician, Severiano and some other hunters could go. Listen, if you want a good hunt, you need somebody who knows what he's doing. I'll be over early in the morning. Felo, where are you going? I'm going to sing you a famous old song of what happened one dry on the Flower State to a wastrel, a gambler, a drunkard named Juan who lived by the rule of "do it, don't wait." Everybody called him the Dangling Sword In matters of love he was daring and bold. He diddled with all of the prettiest girls ... diddled and fiddled and then left them could. One Sunday morning (he was there at the bar) his buddies came running to warn him (or try), "a lot of men are after you, Juan. They'll kill you for sure, there's blood in their eyes." I'm heating some water, there's the towel. A brigade of women? What for? I don't know, Felo. Aren't you going to have a bath? Won't you wash that eye? Soap won't do any good. I don't know any more what soap can do. Strange things have been happening in this house. A famous ballad I'll sing if I can, the very sad tale of a lovelorn man: a wastrel, a gambler, a drunkard was he... Here comes your friend Severiano. Think of all the dominoes you've played here. Look, Lourdes Maria, you don't understand. Don't get into it... Just give me coffee. Aren't you going to eat? Didn't you tell me the moon was bad for wet hair? Where are you going, Felo? To prepare for tomorrow's hunt. I have to clean my rifle, it is wet. Don't stay away long. Your son's about to come. Did you hear me? Listen. Don't you hear them? No. The ants, The ants are eating the orange tree. Don't you hear them? That's the last straw, the ants are eating the orange tree. When a wild dog's running, don't aim at his body. Always aim a few inches ahead of him. This is important 'cause the wild dog will run into the bullet. He's faster than your shot and that's what kills him. Sometimes, you may not want to kill him. Anybody can kill a wild dog. I think the important thing is to chase him, surround him and know that you were faster and more intelligent, even if he escapes in the end. OK, but we want to kill this son of a bitch. I wasn't talking about that dog. From now on, be very quiet, 'cause a wild one senses you before he sees you. Be alert. Hey, Felo, have you ever tried sage? it's a wonder. You! Go along there, to the end of the beach. When you get there, let the dogs loose. Remigio, come with me. Let's go! Come on, dogs! Come on, Duke, Pirate... The animals are nervous. Something big's over there. Don't worry. These aren't the Manacal lowlands. Let's go! Lazy! Come on! Come on! What's going on! Who's there? Counterrevolutionaries, by god! Remigio! Remigio! Here! They got me, dammit. They've ruined my arm. Let's get out of here, to the clearing. Where's Felo? Felo! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go. This is the one. Now we'll smear the trunk and those SOBs'll die. What's the matter, Eulalia? You'll knock over the lantern and burn us up. Hell! What's that? The bombing, Severiano. The bombing the radio was talking about. What're you saying? You're to blame, dammit! You're to blame 'cause you joined the militia. I told you, and now they're going to bomb us. They're lost, Eulalia. Shut up. Be quiet. They must be lost. Shit, they're lost. Be quiet! They bombed us. They bombed all around us. Let's go. Come on, you. You know I was a guide, but I've never seen anything like this. Thank goodness the house wasn't hit. If it had been, we'd've really been screwed. The cigar. Captain, those weapons were meant for Los Hondones, where the hunters clashed with counterrevolutionaries. And those creeps fired at the first light they saw. Who'd have guessed that 2 goofs would foil the Americans' plan? Twin, give me that pistol. There are tons of pistols. Close the box. Make an inventory of what's there. You really have to sweat to get a pistol here. Take it. Won almost in combat. I don't like to see you like this. If I thought it was because of the wild dogs, I'd go out and bring you one. Yes, I know. It's just a bad period. Things pile up on you. So what happened? Did you lose the dog? It seems that the one who's going around lost is me, Lourdes Maria. Flash! An unidentified light plane coming from the north dropped flammable materials on the cane fields around the Santa Marta Sugar Mill. Another attack by the traitors. And now, Trinidad y Hermanos cigarettes bring you the taps in Mexican music in a special program for farm families. Eulalia! Eulalia! Bring the oil! And the matches! Eulalia! It's Ortelio and Aguada. - Severiano! - How are you, Ortelio? Look, Major Montero. I'm going to tell you what we should do. We shouldn't just wait for the Agrarian Reform. It'll start in Oriente and Pinar del Río first. Meanwhile, those SOBs are sending the cattle Into the hills and burning our supplies. We can't let them win. We have to move first to defeat the counterrevolution. You're one of the first who can help us 'cause you were a guerrilla guide. Now you'll be a delegate of the Agrarian Reform. You'll help us distribute deeds to the land... which will belong to all of you. Start telling your neighbors about it tomorrow. Are there many? No, not very many... Abilio, the Galician, Manuel, Felo... The hunter? Yes. And Antonio and the Peñate family... Good, good. All of them, But don't let me catch any of them paying rent! What do you think? Well! What do I think? It's the Government that's giving me the land? ls that what you say? The land's yours, Felo! Great! But what guarantee are they giving me? What do you mean "guarantee"? - Severiano. - It's OK. Leave it to me. I need guarantees. A farmer "representing the Revolution" goes around telling the farmers the land's theirs. That talker and land distributor hadn't come by here. It looks like he was afraid or something was bugging him. Your guarantee is the Revolution and the pants you wear, dammit! You mother! Loudmouth! Severiano! You're crazy. What's this?! That's enough! But they're giving you the land, Felo! He had it coming. You're mad. And Nando, they even gave me the land. Understand? For tree. No more rent! But Severiano's the one who distributed it? First he socks you. then gives you land that isn't his. Hold your horses! Don't mix things up. I socked him, too. Get that in your head. I accepted the land, but not from him. Besides, Nando, you have your land, you were lucky. It wasn't luck, I worked for it. Look, Nando, hunting isn't all I know about these hills. I know about your deal with Lora. That's your business, but don't think me a fool. At least Lora didn't support Batista. I don't know if he did or not. I do know he's a bastard. Hell, I can't understand what's going on. It's all very easy to give away what isn't yours. It's the same as always, everybody grabbing. If you're late or the boss doesn't like you, you're screwed. Look, Nando, I don't get what you're talking about. Dammit, you're talking about Lora as if he were a relative of mine or something. And now... People should be grateful. Felo. Now what? You're saying I'm not? When Lora was going to evict me, who interceded? You did, right? I owe that favor to you. To both of us, Felo. To both of us. Shit, Nando, we're really in a bad way. Felo! Oh Nando, excuse me. Felo, remember the meeting in town. What meeting? You said you'd take me to the women's meeting. Well, I was just leaving. I only dropped by, I'm sorry you're always rushed here. No, no, that's OK. I'm sorry I didn't eat some of your wife's stew. I told you a long time ago you should've left these hills and opened a restaurant In Aguada. It's quieter. Hey, bring me that cow, will you? You told me there weren't any reds here. Now, the place is crawling with them even the wild dog hunter you recommended 2 years ago. And you know why? 'Cause they're giving them my land. My land, dammit! Look, Lora, they aren't stupid. Who can take the farm away from one of these hicks? Who'll make anybody pay rent? What the goddam hell do you mean? You sure don't get to know men by hunting. You too, if you hadn't been so desperate you might not've had to pay me for your land. No, no. I don't like presents. I've always paid my way. Why're you this way? That's what it's about now, Nando. Now, you have to really pay. Look how they treat you after you fought for them. That should worry you. You're being left out. Hey, man, this is the only way to see you now. Well, well! Comrade Severiano Flores! My childhood friend, my guerrilla guide and now the Santa Claus of the Escambray. How's the land giveaway going? Lot of paperwork, Nando. How're your wife and kids? Fine, everybody's fine, thank God. Hey, what a rod! A Colt .45, really nice! It must've set you back at least 300 pesos, right? You're not even warm, Nando. I got it free. Then it's to be doubly respected, eh? That's the way, comrade! You think what you did was right? You don't want to understand, Dad. So what do I have to understand, boy? That there's a war going on. Naturally lots of things change. They almost killed you and you haven't even rejoined the militia. or gone to track down the cattle or anything. All you've done is fight with Severiano. There are more than enough farmers to do all that. One more or less doesn't matter. And don't talk to me about Severiano! I don't want to hear anything about him! What you should fuss about is nobody's cooked any meals. for the last 2 days. Your mother says she's busy with the brigade.. and here you come yapping about the war. and changes. You want me to tell you something everybody knows? Wild dogs were made to be hunted, and women were made to stay home with their husbands! And men were made to be faster and smarter than wild dogs, as you yourself taught me. You really have to sweat to get those animals down. Anybody missing? The Galician's here. Here comes Peñate. Felo's missing. - Good morning. - Good morning. It's bad up there. They've cleaned out all the corrals ... everything but a few scrawny cows. Good morning. Where're we going? To Alto Jobo. There are 4 bulls there that have gone wild. OK. I think we should go up the ravines to keep them from jumping to the other side. Anybody got a better idea? OK. Let's go. Goddamn! What a wild bull! The Revolution wants you to learn sewing and first aid and reading. And by "reading" I mean writing too. Maybe we'll have a surprise for, some of you soon. Maybe some of you'll go to Havana to study. Yes, I mean it! To Havana, to some pretty houses, to learn. The Revolution be very pleased with you. You can be a great help to the Revolution. Lourdes Maria, there'll be no going to Aguada tonight, no brigade, no Migdalia, no nothing! What do you think of that? Felo, tonight there's an important meeting, a send off for the ones who're going to Havana. Eulalia and I are in charge of the decorations. - In charge of what? - The decorations. If her husband's henpecked that's his problem. He treats her better than you treat me. What the hell. Now he's an official, a delegate. Naturally, he has to let his wife do what she wants. He's probably doing more than you. He's an inspector now. The other day I saw him at Antonia's house. They were having lunch. I went by there with Eulalia. It's true, everybody has his cross to bear. Eulalia's is with Severiano and a daughter of Antonia's. She's a real flirt. But it's OK. She's going to Havana. The comrades on horseback, please move away. The comrades on horseback, away from the audience. Want a light? - How are you, boy? - Fine. Listen, the quarrel between you and Dad won't affect our friendship, will it? You haven't visited me for a long time. You know how it is. There's no time even to go to the john, Where are they going? To hit Porfirio Ramirez and Tomasito's gangs of counterrevolutionaries. Well, I'll see you, boy. The meetings and papers are getting me down. I didn't even take a bath today. I want to talk with you about your father. Drop by the house. This is no time for old men's foolishness. I'll be by tomorrow for sure. Isn't Felito coming today? Who knows? Want some coffee? - What happened? - Wait. Felo, the famous hunter. What lousy dogs I have! No, it's just that they know me. I'm like a member of the family, right? Aren't you going to let me come in? Go to the bedroom, Lourdes Maria. Go on! Sultan! King! Get that man away from the dogs. Guess what happened to us this noon. A hunter went by a rife shot away but I told the boys: "Take it easy, take it easy, he's OK." Things are going to start popping. Felo, and you're one of the men I need here. I need this area to be clean. I need your help. We've known each other for a long time. What do you want, Nando? Are you in a hurry? Nobody's ever come in like that. If my son comes, who knows what'll happen. Shit, you've gone wild. suspicious and holed up. Things sure have changed. Today I can't go home 'cause it sure to be full of troops. You've stopped hunting. And the clods are taking over. Shall I call Lucio? No, let me finish here. Get the sacks. My friend's going to give us some vegetables. Some vegetables for a start. About your son, we'll see about him later. Take what you want, Nando, and get going. And, if I see the famous Manacal bitch, I'll let you know. What are you going to do, Felo? I'll have to go to Aguada. Nando Cardoso's trail begins at my house. Halt! Get down. Take it easy, farmer. What's going on? What's going on? Shit! Look who's here! My guerrilla guide. Comrade Severiano! With a pistol, Nando. Let me see the pistol. The one that didn't cost you anything. My, my! This pistol was dropped for us, and you got it. But now you're returning it to us. How about that? And it's all greased up. Don't worry, Delegate. Today, we just scared you. Go on down to town and say Major Nando Cardoso kept your pistol. Go see who'll come get it for you. Let him go. Let him go, Mexican. You can tell them all about it. Nando. What? You know I'm not going to do that. Give me my pistol. Give me my pistol. You're going down there, farmer. Give me my pistol, Nando. My pistol. Let it go, dammit! The whole Escambray must've heard that. Oh, hell! Now there's no turning back. Let's head for the lowlands. Later, we'll join Porfirio. Come on! Let's go! Damn, it's Severiano. Abilio! What's wrong? Nando killed Severiano. What the hell dare you saying? He's there lying on the path. Get him, Abilio. You can't leave a man like that! But Felo.... Go inside. Take the kids inside. Felo what's this?! Hey, what're you doing? Nando went to the Manacal lowlands. I'm going to get there first, Don't lose your head, Felo. Wait for me. I'll tell the people. Your son's coming. I don't have time, Abilio. Catch up with me there, I won't wait long. Felo! Felo, my brother went to tell the troops. No, we can't wait here. If Nando leaves the lowlands he'll escape. How many are there? How'll we stop them? We'll catch them by surprise. They don't run as fast as the wild dogs. But they're men, Dad. You stay there on the path. I'll go in and drive them out. You're going in alone? We're here, but this'll be hell. Stay there on the path. Shoot at their bodies. That's where those SOBs will come out. I'm going with you, Dad! It's the militia, Nando. We're surrounded. "Militia", hell. The only one who could get here so fast is Felo, that damn hunter. Where are the others? They went down there. This is the end, Nando. Go back up, and we'll get behind them. Go on, dammit! Abilio! Abilio! Hurry Felito, or they'll surround us. Over there! Felo, the trail ends here. This is your last hunt. You damn farmer! Shit!
