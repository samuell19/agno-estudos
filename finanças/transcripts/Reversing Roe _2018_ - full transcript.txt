Everything involved in an abortion is sin and it's wrong. I actually believe it's evil. And so there's no value in things that are evil. The child is ripped limb from limb while it's still alive, while his heart is still beating. I'm a mother. I loved my pregnancies. I love my children. I'm now a grandmother of four. When a woman becomes pregnant... she loses a part of herself to someone else. Most of us want that because it's beautiful. It is not that way for everyone. We can sit here self-righteously and decide that we always know best for every person, but we do not. There's no reason to come back here, session after session, and make it more and more difficult and drive women back into the shadows of illegal abortions, because it's exactly what this will do. They will not stop having them. They've always had abortions. We've always had abortions. Women always had abortions. And that will always be something that will be sought. If you want to stop abortions, then help me stop unwanted pregnancies. Question occurs on the adoption of the amendment. Representative Klick voting aye. Representative Oliverson voting aye. Have all members voted? There being 92 ayes and 42 nays, the amendment is adopted. A bill has moved forward in the legislature, placing more restrictions on abortion... They're trying to get something in place... Texas will have new abortion regulations. So that there's less and less opportunity to have an abortion, till, perhaps, there is no option at all. I was a young woman prior to Roe v. Wade, when abortion was illegal. I know the difficulties of that period of time. The idea that we would go back to that was just unbearable to me. The bill banned one of the most common types of second-trimester abortions. This bill prohibits one specific procedure. But we made it very clear from the beginning that the legislative priority needs to be something that will stop abortions. The legislative priority needs to be something that reveals the truth about abortion, and the legislative priority needs to be something that will get us closer to overturning Roe v. Wade. My goal is to make abortion at any stage a thing of the past. This bill actually protects human life beyond 20 weeks here in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I am pro-life, and I very strongly believe that we must promote life, defend life... My goal is to end abortion in Mississippi. There is a steady chipping away of the right to abortion in America. There are places in the country, it's as if Roe versus Wade never happened. The Supreme Court today legalised abortions. Since 2010, 300 abortion restrictions have been passed in this country, and I think many people are unaware of how restricted abortion has become. The Republican Party's the party of life, because people want life, they don't want death. We want to end abortion. If we're gonna do it through continuous legislation, then we're gonna go back again and again and again, until we win. I think the feeling was that with the climate as pretty tense around the abortion issue in Missouri... Missouri used to have several places where you could get an abortion, but over the last decade, more and more laws and regulations have been passed... Planned Parenthood confirmed the Columbia clinic has stopped performing abortions. And because of that, it becomes harder and harder to provide that care. Thursday was the last day women could have an abortion at the clinic. And now there's just one abortion clinic in Missouri. She's the lady that does the abortions. The Planned Parenthood in Saint Louis. God does love you. Please, think about what you're doing today and not do that. These babies don't want to die today, Colleen. When I started out, I thought abortion would just be part of my practise; that, you know, just like people need hysterectomies, people need abortions, and I will take care of my patients who need those. But I realise that in conservative states it can be very hard to get an abortion. And so I became a physician who really focuses on abortion care. I live in Saint Louis, but... three out of four weeks, I'm travelling somewhere. And it might be Monday and Tuesday in Oklahoma, Friday and Saturday back to St. Louis. Then the following Monday in Wichita, which is one of the four places where I provide abortions. They kill people for a living here. We cannot stand by and say, "Well, we're just gonna let that happen," or it's the woman's choice and so on. I'm happy with what we're doing, and I'm gonna continue doing it. And we're gonna win. I'm a big-time Trump supporter, and we're gonna win this. It's... The time is coming. The truth is coming out, that's what's happening. Well, I've had these people out here ask me what my thoughts and opinions of abortion itself is. And I give them the same answer. "My opinion." I keep it that way. The main reason I'm here is that girl that flies up there on that flagpole. What I have against these people more than anything is that they keep trying to push their religion up on someone else in a nation that's supposed to have religious freedom. You know, you can think whatever you want about it. But, in America, one in four women will have an abortion in their life. So, to me, abortion is just basic health care. We're gonna remove the pregnancy, okay? And when I think about how politicised this has become... I wonder, you know, well, how did this happen? In all the soul-searching I have done, I sincerely feel that if they do it now... that they are only disengaging from me... a kind of mass of tissue. In the early 1960s, abortion was illegal. And there was a woman named Sherri Finkbine. She was a children's television hostess in Phoenix. Miss Sherri. She had four children, and she was pregnant with a much-wanted baby. But she had taken this drug called thalidomide. And she went to her doctor and said, "What about this?" And he said, "I recommend that you have an abortion." He said, "I can arrange an abortion for you in the hospital here." Hospitals did some what they called "therapeutic abortions," only to save the life of women. But if the doctor wanted to help the woman out, he would interpret that very broadly. The woman might say, "I'm gonna kill myself." Then he could say, "Her life is at stake." If therapeutic abortion is done, it's usually done on the basis of the mental and emotional disturbance to the patient. Women had to go before a committee of male doctors to ask for an abortion. And women were often treated very badly. Like, "Well, we'll do the abortion for you, but if you agree to be sterilised." It was a common procedure. "We don't want to clean up your mess." They would say things like that. But if you were a wealthy white woman, you could probably find a way to get access to the procedure, and it would be called a therapeutic abortion. Sherri had an appointment at the hospital for the abortion. And she felt that she had an obligation to let this be known so that other women in the same position would have the same option. But once the... the word kind of got out into the local newspaper, you know, the hospital said, "Oh, no, we can't give you an abortion." She couldn't find a place for an abortion any place in the country. She had to go to Sweden. I just want to do what's right for myself and my family, and I don't feel bitter towards people who oppose this religiously. I think we're doing the right thing. I'd like to really emphasise. We're not making a decision for other people. This is right for our family and in our particular case. This became a big story. It was in Life magazine. I remember as a very young kid reading it and thinking, "What's this about?" So, it focused people's attention. If you were pregnant and did not want to be, in the '50s and '60s, you had very few options. So, if you didn't want to have a child, either you were lucky enough to have a family doctor who would help you, or to have enough money to go to Puerto Rico or some other country, where you could get an abortion. After I graduated from college, I was pregnant and I was in England. I didn't know what to do and... was terrified. And I found a doctor in the phone book in London. And he said, "Promise me two things. One, you will not tell anyone my name. And two, you will do what you want to do with your life." And I'm grateful to him to this day. I didn't know anything about abortion until I became the chaplain at Skidmore College in 1966. And I told my wife at one point, I said, "You know, 1,400 young women. What kind of problems could they have?" And she said, "You're a dope. You're gonna find out." Students who were pregnant, but didn't want to tell their families, would come to me. And I'd send the student to a doctor in Schenectady, who always found it necessary to do an abortion. And that's how I learnt that I wasn't just a chaplain. I learnt I was an abortion counsellor. There were many other college chaplains doing the same thing around the country. This is the Clergy Consultation Service on problem pregnancy. The first public organised group was the Clergy Consultation Service. This was 19 Protestant ministers and two Jewish rabbis. Clergymen counselling this week are Reverend... And I was a part of that. We would not ask them why they were having the abortion. That was not our business. But most of the women wanted to talk about it. They wanted to tell me why. And so it was quite an education for a young male minister into the lives of women. We went into this apartment, and it was dark, dingy. He apologised. He said, "I'm sorry you have to be treated like a criminal." This 24-year-old girl had an illegal abortion less than an hour ago. The laws which govern abortion are broken an estimated one million times a year. Even though they suffered great indignity, wealthy women often had a safe way of ending an unintended pregnancy. But during my clinical training at Harlem Hospital, I really was thrust into an environment where women were from a very poor and deprived background. And then I saw that African-American women who were disproportionately poor were the most directly hurt by the restrictive policies of the time. There were some pretty sad cases of women attempting to terminate their pregnancies themselves. The facts are astonishing. 350,000 women a year suffer complications. 5,000 of these women die. There were many terrified women who were using coat hangers and knives and throwing themselves down stairs. And going to an illegal abortion doctor was often unsafe. It was just a piece of hanger, an ordinary hanger. Not a whole one. Just a piece. When you have an abortion, you have to pay $700 to go through this cloak-and-dagger business to find you some guy who's willing to stick a hanger up you. I heard that there was a meeting. It was being held in a church in the Village. What I'm talking about, more than likely, look at your neighbour. She had an abortion. And, you know, women just got up and told their stories. Those men offered me a deal: I couldn't have an abortion if I wasn't sterilised... And I had never, ever in my life heard women telling the truth about something that only happened to women, and saying, "This doesn't have to be this way. We have to change it." Because the laws are made to keep that woman in her place. And suddenly, you know, that was a great "aha." You know, I thought, "Okay, I had this experience. One in three American women has had this experience. Why, why is it illegal and dangerous?" That was kind of the beginning of the unravelling. You got something to hide? I'm not sorry I did it and I would do it again, and I think it should be legalised. The issue is reproductive freedom, and that means the right to have children, as well as the right not to have children. Something really profound is happening. Mainly that women have caught onto the game. We don't know it completely yet. You know, we haven't really discovered the total anatomy of our oppression and of what they've been doing to us. But we do know that it's happening. We're on to it. Free choice. This is going to be a battle, and we will not give up on the right of a woman to achieve abortion. Early feminists... understood immediately that abortion was a central issue of feminism and to women's rights. - What do we want? - Free choice. - When do you want it? - Now. If you didn't have control over your own body, what kind of right could you ask for? It is a political issue, and the state means to control our bodies. We produce the soldiers, we produce the workers, and they fear the loss of that control. It's the basis of democracy that you control your own body. And it's the basis of hierarchy and totalitarian regimes that you don't. Safe legal abortions are not available to our... All right. Will you please sit down or be removed... No, we aren't gonna sit down. Why don't you... A woman gets pregnant and she's treated like a criminal. She can't get an abortion. She has to go through having that child, whether she wants it or not. Before the courts got involved in the abortion issue, it looked as if the matter would be settled in politics. California passed a new liberalised abortion law today. California Governor Ronald Reagan actually signed a reform bill. I think one thing that people don't realise today is that it was the Republican Party that was the pro-choice party. And there were states with Republican governors who passed abortion reforms. And then New York totally repealed the old 19th-century abortion law. One of the nation's most sweeping abortion control bills. The New York law said you can have an abortion throughout the first two trimesters just if you wanted. You don't have to give a reason or anything. It's your choice. And on July 1st, 1970, the first legal abortion clinic in America was opened by the clergy of New York City. And that clinic did over a hundred abortions a day for 13 months, until other clinics had formed. This is the first radical step. And that set off the Catholic Church. I have set before you life and death. Therefore, choose life. The unborn child has no choice. Does the Catholic Church give you as much help as you need in this issue? The Catholic Church was very strategic in its opposition to abortion. They set up the Right to Life committee, and the cardinal and the church pushed back vigorously. Legal abortion in New York has already claimed almost a half million innocent lives. And the New York abortion law came up in the legislature. To abort a human foetus in the womb, you oughta get sick to your stomach. There were a lot of Catholic voters in New York, and the church was saying, "We're against abortion." Ours is a nation with a Judeo-Christian heritage. Republicans were in control of the legislature. None of this justifies abortion. And now they were repealing legalised abortion. The Republicans I knew got angry about taxes and how big the budget's gonna be. I think that the traditions of the Republican Party are the traditions of an individual person to choose what he wishes, as long as it doesn't infringe upon other people. We were the party that believed in individual liberty. Congratulations. Governor Rockefeller was pro-choice. One more committee... And we felt, "Why should the state be telling women whether or not they could have an abortion?" Rockefeller vetoed the bill... and abortion stayed legal in New York. There was a Gallup poll in the summer of 1972 that asked people to answer the question, "Do you believe that abortion should be a matter between a woman and her doctor?" Republicans by about two-thirds said yes to that question, "Abortion should be a matter left to a woman and her doctor." Not the government. I think I'm probably the oldest provider of abortion services in the country. I did my first abortion in 1967. Illegal abortion. The Clergy Consultation called, and they asked me, "Curtis, would you consider doing abortions?" Do you have any problems you want to discuss with me? So, that's where it started. And I thought I could go to prison, I could lose my medical licence. And I grew up religious. I became an ordained minister my senior year in high school. And I think the basic Christian teaching is compassion and service. My head and my heart and my hands said to do this. I can make a difference, and I'm going take the risk. I've done this work ever since. I'm now 80 years old. And after 80 years, I've decided I'm not moving on to another career. I think this is it. I mean, I'm still needed. Thank you for calling the Southwestern Women's Surgery Centre. I'm Alicia. How may I help you? Okay. I have availability for tomorrow afternoon... I've been urged by people to pass on what I have learnt and experienced. So, that's what I'm doing, trying to teach as many young doctors as I can. Dilate carefully... My philosophy is that the goal in providing abortions is to assist the woman in making the best decision she can for her and her life... in whatever that takes. The most important moral question of the abortion debate is what is in the womb? Is it a person? Does it deserve our moral attention and protection or not? That is the most important question. In the pro-life movement, we're outraged, because we believe that elective abortion is the taking of an innocent human life. That is an act of injustice that we can stop and we need to stop. - This is Doctor Boyd. - Dr Boyd. If you have questions, we want you to let us know. And we'll take good care of you and make this... Women continue a pregnancy and have a baby, because they want a baby at that time. And they have an abortion because they don't want to be pregnant at that time in their life for their own sufficient reasons. The state of Texas requires that you be seen at least 24 hours before your abortion. And then I'm gonna show you this sonogram. That looks like between five and six weeks, okay? Sonogram technology is one of the best friends of the pro-life movement. It is changing a generation's mind about what's going on in the womb of a woman. It is very common for expecting mothers to have sonograms on their fridge for children to know what that picture is. That is their sibling. And so this was a great tool that we wanted to tap into and to use, and we saw that abortion clinics were already using sonogram technology before an abortion. Good morning, everybody. John Seago with tech... We think very deliberately about what are we doing that is taking a step forward to challenging the very foundations of Roe v. Wade. And the sonogram bill was an important one because we were pushing how much we can require a physician to do. All right. So Chapter 171 of the Texas Health and Safety Code require that I provide you with this information at least 24 hours prior to your procedure. We wanted the sonogram not just to be performed, for the sake of the abortionist, but also to be displayed for the woman to see. That was the whole goal. This little blurry thing right here. If you focus kind of right there and you see a little flicker. Yeah. That's the heartbeat. Cardiac activity. The law says a doctor has to describe what she sees on the screen to the patient, giving her a chance to change her mind, to see the error of her ways and realise what she's about to do. That's the idea. This is the state imposing it upon the woman. She has engaged a doctor to discuss this with her and help her come to a resolution. She did not engage the legislature of the state of Texas. It is the strong conviction of Texas Right to Life that the legislature should work to stop abortions. In the capitol, we have the capacity to direct the conversation. All elective abortion is a violent act of injustice and should be rejected. Hey. If you're running in Texas as a Republican... An inhumane action to a human child in the womb. You have to claim to agree with pro-life principles. Sid Miller helped pass powerful legislation to protect the unborn. Thank you and God bless. You can be elected as agriculture commissioner. You can be elected as the chief financial officer of our state because of abortion. Not because of your skills with numbers. We must pass one of the strongest pieces of pro-life legislation. But because of your skill at getting legislation passed to obstruct access to abortion. That's how powerful this issue is in Texas. That's how powerful pro-life advocacy groups have become. I signed a sonogram law so mothers facing that agonising choice can actually see. And I know it... works. We want to see all unborn children protected, and we believe that what we've been doing is still the best way to approach it. Yet another round in the abortion battle has been fought on... But our roadblock has always been the Supreme Court. The Court declined to overrule Roe versus Wade. We're gonna keep plugging away to overturn Roe v. Wade because we believe this country shouldn't be killing its babies. Is it a legal question, a constitutional question, a medical question, a philosophical question, a religious question, or what is it? There had been other cases around the country trying to challenge local abortion laws. But our case was the first to get to the US Supreme Court. The law in Texas was that abortion was illegal, and we had a woman who was already pregnant who didn't want to be... and she didn't want her name public. So, we thought, "Well, John Doe, Jane Roe." And Henry Wade was the district attorney in Dallas. And it was clear that so many women were affected by this issue. There was a flight that left Dallas every Thursday going to California, and there were usually ten or a few more women on that flight going out to California for abortion. People were going to Colorado. And a lot of people were flying to New York. And there were thousands of women who had had illegal abortion, who had done their own abortion. And so we filed a class action to say that this is a case for all women who are or might become pregnant and want the option of abortion. I was 26. And I was the youngest person ever to argue a case in the Supreme Court. We are not here to advocate abortion. We do not ask this court to rule that abortion is good, or desirable in any particular situation. We are here to advocate for the right of a woman to determine whether or not she would continue or terminate a pregnancy. Roe against Wade was argued to nine middle-aged-to-elderly men. It was a conservative Court. It was a Court with four Nixon appointees. Their presence is expected to make the Court more conservative than at any time in recent memory. But abortion was not a partisan issue at that time. It was a medical problem, it was a social problem. Basic constitutional question is whether or not an unborn foetus is a person, isn't it? At one point a justice had said to me, "When do you believe human life begins?" And I said, "Well, Your Honour, we did not try to say exactly what moment that was." There is no one answer to that. Different religions have different answers to that question, but there is no legal standard that said, "At this point the foetus becomes a human." So, the question is, who gets to make the decision? Is it the woman, or is it the government? And my position has always been it's not the government. Good evening. In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court today legalised abortion. The Court split seven to two with Justices Byron White and William Rehnquist dissenting. The decision made abortion largely a private matter and ordered the states to make no laws forbidding it, except possibly during the final months. When Roe went through, it was a shock to everyone. To go so far over to the other side, to put everything in the woman's hand and essentially dismantle the laws. Now, in any other state, you couldn't pass laws against abortion, not forbidding it directly. It was a constitutional right. The Roe decision held that women have the right to terminate a pregnancy in the first two trimesters, and then it's only at the third trimester that the state has the right to prohibit abortion except when necessary to preserve a woman's life or health. When the Roe v. Wade decision was handed down, Planned Parenthood had been devoted to women's reproductive health and access to contraception. And the local chapters had to ask themselves, "Are we gonna provide abortions now that they are legal?" It was really a moment of reflection that was very tough for the organisation. March 11th is... When it first became legal, Planned Parenthood was not keen on abortion. Various affiliates around the country, a lot of them didn't want to do abortions. They really didn't. The board would be divided. Half the people would want to, the other half wouldn't. Now, after the doctor's examined you and everything is all right, the first thing he's going to do is use the speculum. This is the... But one by one, they swung over to the active side. And when they did, the people who didn't like abortion would resign from the board and other people would come on, and it's committed now, committed to this right, given by the Roe v. Wade decision. No court opinion can change the law of God. Every legal possibility must be explored to challenge the opinion of the United States Supreme Court. Life begins at conception. Protect the life of the unborn. So, as long as there was no New York law or no Roe v. Wade, the woman was really, you know, an outlaw. She was moving around, trying to get some procedure that was against the law. And nobody really tried to stop her very much. But when the Court said, "You have the right to make this decision. You have the right to define your life. Not religion." That was unacceptable. Get out. There won't be any murder here today. So, the Catholics were already involved with various pro-life things. But for Operation Rescue, the genesis really was more evangelical. We rejoice, Lord. Hallelujah. Glory to God. The name comes from Proverbs 24:11. The Biblical verse that says, "Rescue those unjustly sentenced to die." Someone else can be hooked up to this pipe. There'll be no abortions in here today. No abortions in here today. Amen. And so our motto was, "We're here to rescue the innocent child sentenced to die today." People out into the street. There's hundreds more... It was a very immediate thing. Almost militaristic. Operation Rescue. We're here to rescue these babies. The judges, the politicians, they're getting the signal, as is Planned Parenthood. Legalised child killing's days are numbered. We will win. This is a phenomenon. It was really an outworking of our Christian faith. So, this is the epicentre of Operation Rescue. This is a former abortion clinic. We actually took this place that was an abortion mill. We closed it down, we remodelled it, and now we've made it our headquarters. Before we closed the place down, the property line is right down on this crack. And we would stand right here and minister to the women that were going in this abortion clinic. If we stepped over the line, we'd be arrested. Just like that, be arrested. Operation Rescue has targeted Wichita with virtually all of its resources, attempting to close the city's three abortion clinics. Thousands of people came to Wichita, and that's because of George Tiller. George Tiller's Women's Health Care Services clinic is just one of three in the nation which perform late-term abortions. The issue is a moral imperative from God Almighty to rescue those led to slaughter. The pro-life movement here looks bigger than ever. Federal marshals were escorting patients through the protesters, into the clinic. Operation Rescue had really caused a shutdown in that city. And I received a message saying that Phil Donahue wants you to do a show in Wichita, and he wants to do it with Randall Terry. And so, you know, to go to Wichita in the midst of this, we were kind of going into the belly of the beast. Faye Wattleton, I'm saying this to you. You have betrayed your race. When you think... Absolutely. To say that abortion for black women is somehow a favour to them to kill their offspring... To be characterised as being engaged in black genocide is just what it is. It's incendiary rhetoric that was designed to inflame the debate. - Let me finish, Faye. - I do not need you to tell me what my choices are about my life and my body because I am a black person. Planned Parenthood does a hundred thousand abortions a year. They've killed more children than any organisation in the country. I think this really is about women's status in society, controlling women's behaviour and the limits of that behaviour. Any contraceptive that is an abortive agent, such as the IUD or the pill, I believe should be banned. Mr Terry has in fact revealed the ultimate agenda of Operation Rescue and all of its type. No. The emotion and the hot emotion is around abortion. It's murder, Phil. That's what we have laws for. It raises a lot of conflict around sexuality, and... without any question, it's formidable. Must be decided by the woman and her physician, and not by Randall Terry and other people trying to make that decision. But the ultimate decider here must remain women. And that's what we're really fighting for. If abortion is illegal, what happens to those who perform the abortion? Mr Terry? Let me say this. Dr George Tiller's gonna do hard time when this is all over. He is a mass murderer. He is an enemy of humanity. The abortion battle has taken a violent turn. It was just one round after another. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Dr George Tiller shot by a protester. We take no blame for this. The blame rests with the child-killing industry. They're the ones that are killing children and breeding such frustration in people. We didn't know where the gunshots was coming from. Just shooting and shooting. Two women were killed in Boston. A doctor was killed in Pensacola. Then a doctor and an escort were killed. Two bombs rocked an abortion clinic in Atlanta. Every abortion clinic is a potential target for those who would do this. And at that point, I think, there was a gravity that came out of the movement. We lost another doctor in '98. And we lost Dr. Tiller... in 2009. Dr George Tiller was shot dead at his church in Wichita, Kansas. A man shot him in the Lutheran church, in cold blood. The suspect is in custody, and right now the police... And you really have to think about this, that you would do this kind of thing. That's really astonishing. That's just astonishing. Did there come a point in time where your faith, your religious beliefs changed? Yes. I had been watching The 700 Club regularly. Because that baby is made in the image of God Almighty. I was alone in my living room, and... that day I kneeled down and I did accept Christ as my saviour at that time. Religion can make people crazy. It really can. And it can be wonderful, but it can also be just incredibly intolerant. All those people who shot these people at the clinics and so on, they were all religious. The tie that this clinic has to Dr Tiller is really important to me. You know, that even in the face of assassinating one of our providers, we were still gonna provide that care because women still deserve that care. And we do a checkup for you, make sure everything's okay. Right. There's a lot of traumatic memory of things that have happened in the abortion movement, of clinics being bombed, providers being targeted. You are a killer, condemning your own soul to hell. You know, the potential that your family will be targeted. Dr Johnson has been killing children in our city. That people may show up at your home or at your kids' school. And you layer all of this difficulty of actually practising medicine with the threat to safety or harm to you or your family, it becomes a really difficult choice to make for many people. And one of the strategies of the antichoice movement is to shame people. They kill your baby. They won't let you... People who provide abortions and people who have abortions. If you don't kill your baby. If you think about controlling when and if and how many children somebody has, it's sort of the absolute demonstration of patriarchy. Because controlling people's fertility can affect what education they can get and what career they can have and sort of how far they can go in life. The weak link in the abortion chain is the person doing the actual abortions. And there's fewer and fewer abortionists that are doing them here in the United States. And they're retiring and they're moving on. And so we've been very effective in targeting particular abortionists. If they don't have an abortionist, the place closes down. And when abortion clinics close, babies get saved. These are abortion clinics we've closed down, put them out of business. This is in San Diego, Oceanside. Lawrence, Kansas. I like to look at it as a trophy wall. We have probably closed down hundreds of abortion clinics, and it's the one thing I'm most proud of. Right now, there are seven states that have only one abortion provider, and those states have been under siege in terms of restrictions on women's health care. So, we are constantly monitoring the patterns in the states in terms of legislation that restricts women's access to abortion... We've seen a lot of state moves to defund abortion providers. Thinking about what we need to do to block legislation from passing. We got that law preliminarily enjoined. And then if it does pass, we consider bringing a court challenge. So, for Kentucky TRAP... And Kentucky is a perfect example. We are going to do the best that we can to usher in a new day for Kentucky. Before Governor Bevin took office, there were three abortion providers in Kentucky. I'm unapologetically pro-life. And he sprung right into action to pick off abortion clinics one by one. Governor Matt Bevin has ordered a Louisville Planned Parenthood clinic to stop performing abortions immediately. For the second time, Bevin administration has sued a clinic over abortion. And we gave them an immediate cease and desist. We said that we would seek an injunction if necessary. The Republicans now have control of both the House, the Senate... We had three abortion clinics. We are now down to one. And now Governor Bevin is trying to shut down the last remaining clinic, EMW Women's Centre. Bevin administration's new rules for abortion clinics. And at the ACLU, we think what Governor Bevin is doing is blatantly unconstitutional. If a judge sides with Governor Matt Bevin, Kentucky will become the only state in the nation without an abortion clinic. The situation in Kentucky really is unprecedented. We have never seen a situation where we have been on the cusp of a state that has no abortion provider. It's incredibly dire for women. Close this place down. Governor Bevin, close this place down. It's exciting to see pro-life activity at the last abortion clinic in Kentucky, because I have been looking so forward to the moment when we have an abortion-free state. And let's see if we can't put the final nail in the coffin of the abortion clinic there. We in the Commonwealth of Kentucky respect the sanctity of human life... And Governor Bevin's been fantastic. Republicans stand against abortion, stand for the Ten Commandments, and they stand for marriage between a man and a woman. And the Republican Party has kind of become the party of morality. And there's a war for the heart and soul of America. This debate is about little babies who haven't given their consent, and it's about time we said enough is enough. Nobody's saying that Planned Parenthood can't be the leading advocate of abortion-on-demand in America, but why do I have to pay for it? Washington needs to defund them, send a clear message. I come here today to ask my fellow senators to vote to defund Planned Parenthood. Because this language and messaging around defunding Planned Parenthood has been so pervasive, I think the general population believes that defunding Planned Parenthood means not paying for abortions. But in fact, and by law, no federal dollars go to pay for abortion. Two and a half million patients depend on Planned Parenthood every single year for birth control, for testing and treatment for sexually transmitted... We don't want our tax dollars going to that organisation for any service that they provide. Planned Parenthood is a mega abortion provider. It's about a third of all abortions performed in this country are done by that one organisation. We just see them as... as baby killers. Please join me in welcoming the President of the United States, Barack Obama. And when it comes to abortion, they pretty much get to control the agenda in the Democratic Party. Planned Parenthood is not going anywhere. It's not going anywhere today, it's not going anywhere tomorrow. And it's a known fact. Republicans will pass pro-life legislation. We voted to defund Planned Parenthood. Republicans made huge gains, not only in the House, but in governors' races and state legislative campaigns. We now have Republican... majorities in state legislators and I believe 33 Republican Governors. We've had a game plan for many years, we're following it, and I think it's coming to fruition. What's so important for us to stand up for the cause of pro-life? I cancelled their vacations and I brought them back for a pro-life special session. And I'm convinced that we're going to get the job done. The general assembly is heavily Republican. They have a two-thirds majority in both Chambers. I provide abortion care in several clinics in the Midwest. And the clinics have to be able to comply with the layers and layers and layers of regulations that have been put on them. Legislation is on its way to the House that would require inspections of abortion clinics and enact other new restrictions on the procedure. And now we're facing more legislation, more regulations, new bills being introduced, new laws going into effect, and... on an almost day-to-day basis, what we can do might change. Missouri lawmakers have enacted one of the nation's longest abortion waiting periods. Governor Greitens calls a special session. State lawmakers are back... And there's so much factual inaccuracy in these bills and in hearings, I felt that somebody really needs to be a voice. A voice for medicine and a voice for science. Okay. Good afternoon. I'm Dr Colleen McNicholas. I'm an OB-GYN. I practise in St. Louis. There shouldn't be a pro-life or pro-choice law. There should be a law in healthcare policy that is important and science-based. But every single time I've testified... Why is your opinion so much different than theirs? Lobbyists from the anti-choice group will also testify. Here's some written testimony... And they can say whatever they want. Case by case, to protect the health and safety of women in Missouri. Is it Dr Lee? No, Senator. So, you're not a physician. Are you a pathologist? Not at all. Which is infuriating. Especially from sort of the standpoint of science and evidence and... just facts. The abortion clinic in St. Louis has not been complying with the law in terms of turning over complication reports. Every year we have dozens of pro-life bills introduced. Lawmakers who come to me and say, "Sam, what can I do?" What type of bill can I introduce to reduce abortions?" It's a bit of a cat and mouse game between the pro-life pro-choice side, is not turning in complication reports. Once again a bill on abortion regulations moved through the legislature. They have to have a complication plan. This is how I feel. Okay? We're not in the field of medicine here. When did the government start approving complication plans? I thought the doctors or the physicians would do that. Our complaint is that that should be for all clinics. If abortion facilities have to comply with certain things, then so too should other clinics that are providing similar levels of care. Are you putting plans together for anything else? I mean, you could eat too much pork. And have a gallstone and you'd have to go through surgery. Why is it that we're just doing this when it comes to individuals wanting to have an abortion? - Well, I mean it is... - It sounds so ridiculous. Abortion is different than just any other medical procedure. I know that the Democrats and Planned Parenthood want to treat it that way. I know they want to talk about in that way. But talk to your average person on the street. And they're going to tell you that abortion is not the same as having a colonoscopy or having your tooth pulled. It's something unique and different. There is no other medical procedure, none, not one, that is legislated in the way that abortion is. Enough is enough. I'm ready to go down fighting, because I'm tired of the Republican Party bullying women when it comes to their right to choose. I'll tell you what. I am proud to be with so many people standing for life here in Missouri. Message received. Thank you... You know, from the perspective of today, I think it's important to remember that abortion was not always so partisan and it wasn't always a requirement for the Republicans to be pro-life. In fact, it took years of cultivation... We're concerned that a million babies are dying... by very smart Republican strategists. It took years to bring about that kind of party realignment, the placing of abortion front-and-centre as a social, cultural issue in our politics. We're concerned about the moral problems, the breakdown of the family. We've come to seek the welfare of America's children. God bless you and have a great day. And it was accomplished in the 1980s, by this coalition of social and religious and political conservatives. And it was done with the rise of Ronald Reagan. The 1980 election is when abortion really becomes a political issue and particularly a Republican issue. We have a threefold primary responsibility. Number one, get people saved. Number two, get them baptised. Number three, get them registered to vote. Falwell saw evangelical Christians as the basis for a political movement. Falwell wanted to organise evangelical voters, who up until that time had not been politically active. It's always seemed to me we haven't improved by one iota on the Ten Commandments. Falwell and the religious right identifies Ronald Reagan as a candidate who would push their agenda, their socially conservative agenda. Religious America is awakening, perhaps just in time, for our country's sake. But what got evangelical leaders interested in politics was this notion that the Bible mandated the separation of the races. And several so-called segregation academies were applying for tax-exempt status. And the district court ruled that any organisation that engages in racial segregation, or discrimination, cannot claim tax-exempt status. That was the catalyst for the religious right becoming politically active. We have a fight going on... on the question of tax exemptions for Christian schools. Paul Weyrich was one of the chief strategists of the New Right movement. Questions involved are religious liberty questions. It was a movement that said we are going to win the presidency through bigotry, but we are not going to come right out and say it. This coming election's gonna be a big test for us... This election is to make America great again. I have told the Republicans that you are loyal to a certain set of moral precepts in which you deeply believe. Weyrich recognised the electoral potential of evangelical voters, but he needed a populist issue that would appeal more generally to religious voters. And he was savvy enough to recognise that overt racism probably wouldn't work on a wide scale. The pro-family movement and the American people do not want the women's lib ideology forced upon all the rest of us. Phyllis Schlafly had been able to mobilise voters around moral issues. Well, I am certainly opposed to abortion, because I think it's killing an unborn child. And as the presidential election begins to take shape... What are the key issues? In our judgement, the right to life, protect the unborn. These are key issues. Weyrich says, in effect, "We found our issue. Abortion is going to work for us as a political issue." Millions of unborn defenceless babies... When you are trying to change the dynamic of the political system in the country, you have to do it through emotional issues. In our Washington studios is Jerry Falwell. America has violated the principle of the dignity of life since 1973. And we're very strongly pro-life. Our first order of business... And what is more emotional than motherhood and babies? At that point the Reagan campaign begins to embrace abortion as a political issue. I believe that... that when you interrupt the pregnancy, you are taking a human life. Which they ride through the 1980 election. It's interesting. One of the nation's leading pollsters says Reagan is winning the votes of the white electors, who are followers of the evangelical preachers, the so-called Moral Majority, who have been active in the election. This group is providing Reagan with his clear margin in the election. Ronald Reagan's overwhelming victory... Reagan won 44 states, with 479 electoral votes. They set out to change the dynamic in the Republican party. So they nominated somebody that would be useful. And they succeeded. It was now eight years after Roe versus Wade. And it seemed like the future of ending abortion was going to be in the Republican party. And Reagan really gave a lot of hope to the pro-life community. Can a person be a Christian and support federal funding of abortion? I believe in an abortion you are taking a human life. If you believe that, it very definitely has a religious connotation. He just reaffirmed his support of everything the pro-life movement represents. There's never been any question that he was with us. We love life. We want life. In the mind of the pro-life community, the right to abortion was an aberration in the law. So, with the election of President Reagan, we thought the next step would be to try to reverse Roe versus Wade. We want life. It is the Supreme Court that has abolished prayer and the Ten Commandments from the public schools. It is Supreme Court decisions that have brought upon us forced busing and put our children on buses and send them across town to some school that their parents don't want them to go to. It is Supreme Court decisions that have unleashed the pornography that has invaded our news-stands and our television. It is Supreme Court decisions that have abolished capital punishment and deterrents against crime. And, of course, it is the Supreme Court decision that has brought about this tragic evil of our time. A Supreme Court decision, in 1973, that invented this new right of a woman to kill her unborn baby. If abortion is a constitutional right, the most important thing was to overturn Roe versus Wade. In order to do that, you had to change the justices on the Court. There's no other way. You need, as quickly as possible, a reconstituting of the Supreme Court. We just didn't think that the current justices would have changed their minds. I will send to the Senate the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor, of Arizona. The first woman on the Supreme Court, Judge Sandra Day O'Connor. She told the Senate today that she is firmly opposed to abortion. In the area of abortion is that I am opposed to it as a matter of birth control. So, President Reagan appointed O'Connor, then appointed Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy. And in the pro-life community there was the hope that Roe versus Wade may get overturned. And we thought the Court was moving much closer in that direction. Are you getting the feeling that some sort of movement is under way that would ultimately erode Roe v. Wade? I'm not only getting a feeling. I'm part of it. - It's happened? - It's happening. The Americans United for Life is one of the main players in this. They have a strategy of one anti-abortion restriction at a time which could pass state legislatures and maybe get up to the Supreme Court and overturn Roe against Wade. And it looked like it actually might happen in an abortion case in 1989. But Justice O'Connor surprised the world by sustaining Roe against Wade. And that was a matter of extreme frustration to the Court's conservatives. I think Justice O'Connor didn't want to be the first and lone woman on the Court taking away a settled constitutional right. And so she upheld Roe versus Wade. But Justice Blackmun made a very, very important statement, and he read it from the bench and he said, "Roe versus Wade is hanging by a thread. We are in a very tenuous circumstance. We're only one vote away. The next case could do it." And after that, the political situation really changed. Like a thousand points of light in a broad and peaceful sky. When H.W. became president, we thought that he would be a pro-choice president. Abortion divides. We have room in our party for people that feel one way, pro-life, or pro-choice. This is an issue that divides. When he was a congressman, he had been known as a big supporter of family planning, to the point that some of his colleagues called him "Rubbers." Do you favour a constitutional amendment against abortion? I oppose such an amendment. The 35th Republican National Convention. What's the big challenge here this week? I really don't know. I... Abortion, mostly. People really need to understand that the pro-lifers are now the backbone that is holding up George Bush. George Bush has to take a strong pro-family position. And frankly, that means a strong position on abortion. And Bush turned against choice, and he took on a position that was stronger than... than anything Reagan ever did. I believe that abortion is wrong. I believe that we should work to overturn Roe vs. Wade. And I believe that states should have the right to prohibit abortions. I don't make many guarantees, but I'll make you one. Pennsylvania will be the first state in the Union to end the nightmare once and for all and to outlaw abortion. Supreme Court case number 91-744. Planned Parenthood of South-east Pennsylvania versus Casey. Planned Parenthood versus Casey. That went up to the Supreme Court in 1992. One of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation. And a lot of pro-life people thought this was going to be the case that would overturn Roe versus Wade. The Bush administration asked the Supreme Court to support further limitations on a woman's right to have an abortion. President Bush has done all he can do to ensure that my arguments are likely to fall on deaf ears. I was totally convinced that we were going to lose. For he has packed the Court with justices who are hostile to a woman's fundamental right to choose abortion. Abortion litigation is a lot like Sesame Street. You got to learn to count. And the only number that's important is five. Are there five votes on the Supreme Court? Five votes that would overturn Roe. He is the best person for this position. The president nominated Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. And I thought he would be the fifth vote to overrule Roe. And I remember there was a silence in the courtroom that was palpable. Ms Kolbert. Mr Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. Whether our Constitution endows government with the power to force a woman to continue or to end a pregnancy against her will is the central question in this case. And then the Solicitor General of the United States stood up and argued that Roe versus Wade ought to be overturned. The State does have a compelling interest in the potential life, in foetal life, and that interest runs throughout pregnancy. But I wanted the Court to understand the implications of changing a standard that was very protective for women. This Court has recognised that the rights of autonomy, bodily integrity, and equality are central to our notions of ordered liberty. Roe lies at the heart of those interests. Because, ultimately, abortion is not about whether or not women should have particular medical procedures. It's about equality. It's about a view of life, about who should make important decisions. It's very rare that you know the date that the Supreme Court is going to issue a decision. You know that the case will be decided, but you don't know when. But this time we knew when, because every other case that they heard that term had already been decided. We're waiting outside the Supreme Court now for the announcement of the Court's decision. So, there were media trucks parked outside. Everybody was ready and waiting for the overturning of Roe. Release 91-45 Standing Orders. The clerk of the court handed me a copy of the decision. And frankly I was confused in many respects. You know, it's a 50, 60 page opinion. It's complicated. You have to read it and understand it. At the same time, I'm shepherded out to talk to American media about what just happened. I am Kathryn Kolbert. I am counsel of record on behalf of Planned Parenthood and the other abortion clinics in Pennsylvania. It was a very ambiguous decision. Three Republican-appointed justices had gotten together, and they decided that rather than overturn Roe against Wade, they were going to reformulate it... with what they called the undue burden standard. So the Court upheld the right to abortion. But the new standard meant that states can undertake to persuade a woman to carry a pregnancy to term, but they cannot prevent a woman from choosing abortion. Under Roe versus Wade, most abortion restrictions were unconstitutional. In Casey, the Court basically said that states had the latitude to restrict abortion in more ways than under Roe. Many, many kinds of restrictions, waiting periods, informed consent. Things found unconstitutional under Roe have been validated by this Court. And therefore we are much worse off than we have been in the past. At the time, I thought, you know, this is really horrible. To place roadblocks in the path of women... But whatever problems the undue burden standard gave us, it was still preferable than a total outlaw of abortion. For a woman in need of a medical procedure, there's a big difference between having to jump through hoops and not being able to get the procedure at all. Four justices have said Roe versus Wade must be overturned. All it's going to take is one more and I can only hope that President Bush gets re-elected. It makes a difference whether the president believes in a woman's right to choose. And I do. There was some momentum around the Clintons and support for abortion rights. I am proud to nominate Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court. It is essential to woman's equality with man that she be the decision-maker. I'm proud to nominate Judge Stephen Breyer to serve on the United States Supreme Court. And there were bills pending at the federal level to protect access to abortion. The Clinton team has begun to systematically wage war against unborn children. And abortion opponents were looking for a way to stop this momentum. So they came up with this new idea and they honed in on later abortion. Specifically they came up with the term "partial birth abortion." Some of you stay on this side, some of you go on the other side, okay? Not everyone. Try and spread out and get the signs as many places as possible. Partial birth took off like wildfire inside the pro-life movement. It so horrified and shocked the conscience and stripped this veil of respectability from Planned Parenthood and the abortionists. It's terrible. Which side of the fence are we gonna be on? We had to educate the public. Are we gonna continue to support child killing in America and call it choice? We made it an issue. We forced it on America. This is partial birth abortion. The abortionist grabs the live baby's legs with forceps. The Republicans introduced the partial birth abortion law, even though there's no such thing. They made up the word and it was a strategy that really went to challenging the question of when late abortion would be permitted. With the idea that, if you could push it earlier and earlier, you could eliminate a number of abortions And we knew immediately that this was going to be a huge issue. Abortion advocates are claiming that, by banning partial-birth abortion, we are mounting a direct attack on Roe versus Wade. For them, there is never an instance when abortion is inappropriate. For them, the right to abortion is absolute at whatever time, for whatever reason, and in whatever way, a woman or an abortionist chooses. Ninety percent of women who have an abortion have it in the first trimester. That's the vast majority of women. And then a smaller proportion have it before 20 weeks. Between 20 and 24 weeks, we're at probably about one percent. And then, as we get further along, we're getting to smaller and smaller numbers, exceedingly low numbers. So the majority of abortions are in the first trimester. But we spend most of our time talking about abortions that happened in the second and third trimester. And this is one of the strategies of the anti-choice movement. Why do we call something the partial-birth abortion, when really that's not a medical term. You always go after your enemy where they're the weakest. And they know that, once we win, in the ninth month, the rest of the card house comes crumbling down. We destroy their arguments. They created a narrative that women late in pregnancies were killing their babies because they, you know, wanted to go to the gym instead. Totally false. Doesn't happen. But there's no 30-second sound bite to counter that image. They were very good at creating optics, creating language that supported their point of view. And so we had to figure out how to challenge it politically. And we were able to introduce President Clinton to women who would be affected by the law. Women who were losing pregnancies very late or finding themselves carrying a pregnancy with very severe foetal anomalies. Good morning. I'd like to thank the subcommittee for inviting me here. I went in for a routine seven-month ultrasound. They were saying, "This looks good. This looks good." Then suddenly, they got really quiet. The doctor said, "Your daughter has no eyes, and her heart... and other major organs are also failing. And your child will not live." I remember just looking out the window. I couldn't look at anybody. So my mother-in-law asked, "Do we go on? Does she have to go on?" This terrible problem affects a few hundred Americans every year, who desperately want their children, are trying to building families and are trying to strengthen their families. And they should not become pawns in a larger debate. And therefore I had no choice but to veto the bill. I vetoed it just a few minutes ago before I met with these families. Bill Clinton vetoed it, but it really spread. And we started to see new iterations of these bills, using slightly different language, in order to withstand a legal challenge. It's a shame that child sacrifice can be allowed in this country. We are being arrested for speaking and showing the truth of abortion. Okay, careful. Walk carefully. We need to ban partial-birth abortions. I believe banning partial-birth abortions would be a positive step toward reducing the number of abortions in America. We were able to get George W. Bush elected with the promise that, if we got another ban, he'd pass it again and sign it. And he signed the federal ban into law, and it went to the Supreme Court. Hey, hey. Hi, ho. Anti-choice has got to go. The issue of abortion's before the Supreme Court. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced this morning that she will retire. Chief Justice William Rehnquist has died. The nomination power is one of the most serious responsibilities of a president. I will nominate Judge Roberts to the Supreme Court. And Chief Justice Roberts will have as his colleague a proud member of The Federalist Society, Judge Sam Alito, Jr. In a 5-4 landmark decision, the Court's new conservative majority today upheld a nationwide ban on a procedure critics call partial-birth abortion. In court, an angry Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took the unusual step of reading her dissent aloud. I strongly dissent from today's opinion. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away at a right declared in Roe v. Wade. Roe versus Wade prevents us from prohibiting abortion. But it does allow us, the states, to... do some things to protect life, if they can show there is a compelling state interest. Governor Rick Perry wanted to end access to reproductive health care. And because the legislature is so disproportionately led by the Republican party, they proposed abortion restrictions, which were the most extreme in the country. House Bill 2 was a good example of these kinds of laws that were being passed in many states controlled by the Republicans. Laws that really focused on where the abortion could be performed and regulations to either the doctor's office or a surgical centre. Thank you for calling the Southwestern Women's Surgery Centre. This is Alicia. How may I help you? This is what are known as TRAP laws: Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers. And the purpose of these laws is to make it as difficult as possible to provide abortion services, prohibit as many abortions as you can, make the ones that do occur as expensive as possible. It's so obvious what they're doing. My goal is to make abortion, at any stage, a thing of the past. So these restrictions would shut down dozens of women's health centres all across Texas. And that's why Senator Wendy Davis decided to stand up and fight for the rights of women. So this bill went to the Senate. But, because it was the final day of the session, the clock was ticking. And that gave me an opportunity for the filibuster. Members, I'm rising on the floor today... That meant I had about 13 hours of talking to make sure that this bill did not pass. The rules in Texas say that you cannot have a sip of water, you cannot have anything to drink, you cannot lean on your desk and you certainly cannot leave the floor to go to the restroom. So I had a pair of running shoes on my feet and I had a catheter bag. A doctor had come over at about six o'clock that morning and inserted a catheter so that I'd be able to make it through the day. Senator Wendy Davis must make it to midnight. That is the end of the special session. Essentially she's wasting time, running out the clock. The way she's doing that? Right now, she's reading letters from Texas women who oppose this legislation. In order for their voices to be heard. Told me any pregnancy will be very... And the filibuster went viral. Not only was she a woman opposing the bill, but she was one of the only women in the room. It was an internet moment. People had left their kids with their neighbours and driven hours to Austin to be there. Students had left their college campuses and came to Austin to hear Wendy filibuster. These are Texans who relied on the minority... I'm a Texan. Never seen the outpouring of activism like we saw there. You literally could not get in the capitol. Every annex was full, every room was full. It was extraordinary. Another ruling she made was if there was a... And about 15 minutes before midnight, procedural rules of order were broken... and the third... in order to bring my filibuster to an end. And the people who were there understood that rules were being broken in order to silence opposition to a bill. After consultation with the parliamentarian and after... - And they'd had enough. - Well taken and is sustained. Bullshit. The chair recognises Senator... Let her speak. Let her speak. Let her speak. Let her speak. Let her speak. Let her speak. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. And as they began to scream, everyone up and down the hallways began to scream, and at every level of the rotunda and outside on the capitol lawn. And I could literally feel the vibration of their voices and their energy and the pounding of their feet. If I can have order. We are in the middle of a vote. The secretary has started the vote. It ate up enough of the clock that the final vote wasn't taken until 12:03. Members, it's now past midnight. And so... And it became known as the people's filibuster. Rightly so. This is straight from Senator Wendy Davis, okay? Hold your applause. - First, "I love you guys." Okay? - We love you, too, Wendy. "So the lieutenant governor has agreed that SB-5 is dead." The woman who filibustered the Senate the other day, she was born into difficult circumstances. She's the daughter of a single woman. She was a teenage mother herself. She managed to eventually graduate from Harvard Law School and serve in the Texas Senate. It's unfortunate that she hasn't learnt from her own example that every life must be given a chance to realise its full potential and that every life matters. We had successfully killed the bill. But we were called right back within a few days. And, of course, this time there was no way to filibuster. ♪ Where have all the babies gone? ♪ ♪ I pray to heaven for every one ♪ Get ready to do it all again. Governor Rick Perry called a special session early this evening. We talked about the choice. Do you think if the mother had a conversation with the baby and said, "You know, this just isn't really convenient to give birth to you right now. Do you mind dying?" I can't take it any more. - I think... - That was very offensive. I think that baby would say... This is an assault on women. I don't get mad with those folks. I pray for her. You are failing Texas. You are failing Texas. In just a few moments, we are going to vote on a bill that has deeply and profoundly divided us. Separating us by political party... by gender... by life experience... by what our religious beliefs bind us to. Not in this life. We all believe in the beauty and the wonder that is human life. But I also believe that women already here are beautiful. And that they deserve to live, they deserve to determine the direction of their lives, they deserve to be recognised as full people... fully capable of making difficult decisions with the help of their family, their doctor and their God. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. Wendy. No woman should be judged by someone else, someone who believes they would have made a different decision. No woman should be judged by someone else, because these decisions are never ever easy. They're not made casually or quickly. And those of us in the Senate should refuse to make this decision casually or quickly. Because the fight for the future of Texas is just beginning. Thank you, Mr President. Thank you, members. There being 19 ayes and 11 nays, House Bill 2 is finally passed. We won't go back. We won't go back. We won't go back. We won't go back. Come on. We won't go back. We won't go back. It is our responsibility to improve the quality of care for women in the state. Of course, the argument was made all along that somehow this is being done in the interests of women's health. And in spite of incredible scientific pushback to that statement, House Bill 2 passed. Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame. The law went into effect and over half of our abortion clinics in the state closed. We went from 41 clinics to 19 as a consequence of the implementation of the law. In central Texas, there were no clinics left open. And that was pretty demoralising. But there was something really important that had happened. We as a state woke up to the reality of an assault on women. We woke up to the reality of our power. And it's a power that has continued to grow. The first major abortion case in almost a decade. It centres on a case in Texas that has already forced clinics to close and could force even more to close down as well. The stakes are huge. And they're not just huge for Texas women. They're huge for women all over the country. Anti-choice. Anti-women. If the Court affirms the law in Texas, I have no doubt that other states will immediately follow suit. And so many women will no longer have access to abortion care. It's almost like a perfect controlled experiment, isn't it? It's like you put the law into effect, twelve clinics closed. You take the law out of the fact, they reopen. That's absolutely correct. I went to the argument, and I was struck by the difference between a Court with one female justice and a Court with three. Can I walk through the burden? She has to travel 200 miles to get two days of treatment. How many women are located over 100 miles... The women could reinforce each other's viewpoints. There has to some tie between benefit and burden, doesn't there? I think they were very good at throwing aside all of these specious arguments, that the state was making that really all they cared about was women. There are benefits for the ASC and admitting-privileges... What is the benefit... What evidence is there... Just said, "You know, what's going on here is you are making it more difficult for women to exercise their choice... This is one of the lowest-risk procedures. And we are going to respect her decision." this law was targeted at abortion only. Many procedures are much higher risk: colonoscopies, liposuctions. We could go on and on. And I have to tell you, they took over that argument. What it's about is that a woman has a fundamental right to make this choice for herself. Today the Supreme Court struck down a Texas law that imposed strict requirements on clinics and doctors, finding those limits place an undue burden on the constitutional right to abortion. For me, the highlight of that decision was the justices' incorporation of actual medicine and science. We've seen a decision about abortion that says, "If you're going to make a claim, the claim must be factually accurate." But the reality is that the appointing of our justices is highly political. And so, at any time, the balance of the Court can change. And the decision may be different next time. The Supreme Court decision in Hellerstedt motivated pro-life people, reinforced, once again, that if we want to change the laws, we have to change the Supreme Court. Donald Trump meeting privately in New York with leading evangelicals. Donald Trump came and had a conversation. Now we don't agree on everything. I've been working on national elections for a number of years and there's always been an effort to try to consolidate conservative evangelicals. It is a critical voting block for any Republican candidate. To win in November, Donald Trump needs 75, maybe even 80 percent of evangelicals. Our goals are very simple. It is to advance faith in public policy and in our culture as a whole, from a Christian world view. We are unapologetically Christian. Evangelicals have been under constant attack by the Obama administration. And quite frankly, they're tired of it. And under Barack Obama, this heavy hand of government tried to force society to accept things like abortion and the redefinition of marriage. These things run counter to nature. They run counter to the moral law of God. And so what you saw is pushback. Obviously, there's not many choices here. The choice is between Hillary Clinton, and we know exactly what she will provide to America. Or we have Donald Trump. He's considered the least religious of the candidates. If Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her. You know about sexual predators and things like that. You are one. All right, wasn't gonna say that. I'm very pro-choice. I just believe in choice. Evangelical Christians aren't fully on board yet. Some say they may sit home come November. You cannot ignore this constituency. But remember, George H.W. Bush was pro-choice, became pro-life. Mr Bush has something to think about. Human life is precious, born or unborn. Ronald Reagan signed the most liberal abortion law in America in the late '60s, and was a pro-life hero by 1980. I think when you interrupt the pregnancy, you're taking a human life. So all Donald Trump has to do is, as those prior nominees did, make it clear. We came together in a national crusade to make America great again. - And to make a new beginning. - Make it clear. "I changed my views." The justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life. The pro-life constituency is absolutely essential for a Republican victory. Donald J. Trump. Make it clear that if he becomes president, he'll fight for those things. It's not only about Roe v Wade. It is about what's happening right now in America. So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice... I believe what sold the pro-life community on Donald Trump was the final debate in Las Vegas. I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions. I was in the audience. I was watching him. Which divides you... a woman's right to abortion? And when he went into a discussion of partial-birth abortion, late-term abortion... If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother... I knew those were Donald Trump's words. Now, you can say that that's okay. Those were not the words of some speechwriter. It's not okay with me. Because based on what she's saying... It was clearly Trump speaking at that moment. You can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb, in the ninth month, on the final day. And that's not acceptable. And when he did that, I believe he sealed the deal with pro-lifers across the country. And will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend... preserve, protect, and defend... the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution of the United States. - So help me God. - So help me God. Congratulations, Mr President. When I became a physician, the oath that I took was that I was gonna provide the best medical care for all patients who needed it. And patients need access to abortions. And they need care delivered to them with dignity and respect. All right, you ready? So if that means getting on planes or driving hundreds of miles, I'm going to continue to do that, because that's what's needed right now. Women have built their lives around the ability to make decisions about pregnancy. So, we have to make sure that their right is protected. And we have to remain vigilant. Because there is a very real concern that the Trump administration is going to appoint anti-abortion judges. President Trump announced nearly a dozen new nominees for the lower federal courts. Hundreds of seats are going to be filled by this administration thoughout the judicial system. These people will be serving for the rest of their lives. It's life term. It's generations of impact on American law. The Court of Appeals, circuit judges... whether it be district judges... When you really think about the way we're going, years from now, picking good judges even at the district level is extremely important. And that's how we're going to finish this to overtun Roe vs. Wade. Today I am keeping another promise, by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch to the United States Supreme Court. We're putting out strong pro-life bills and so, eventually, the Supreme Court will weigh in on the issue. I don't know how long it will take to overturn Roe v. Wade, or when it will be overturned. I have no doubt it will be. All across the nation, life is winning again in America. In a monumental moment for the Supreme Court, Justice Anthony Kennedy is retiring from the Court. The crucial swing vote is now stepping down and President Trump will get the chance to shape this Court for a generation. This is an opportunity to restore a culture of life in this country. This is a historic moment. And we have a chance to take down Roe v. Wade. I think this supercharges the president's base. Seven out of ten of his evangelical voters said that the Supreme Court has an effect on their daily lives. And I think he should put forth a candidate that is above reproach on this issue of the sanctity of human life. And I think Roe can be overturned. I do believe it could be overturned and I think it goes back to the states. And I think that the states will decide what policies to handle. And I think... we will be a predominantly pro-life nation. You're gonna see 20 states pass laws banning abortion outright. Because they know that there are now going to be five votes on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. If Roe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court, we will see some states that will say abortion is not allowed, there will be some states that are going to... probably not place many limits on abortion at all, but we are not going to stop. We will keep working to protect the unborn babies. Whether or not Roe is overturned, the rights granted by Roe are almost gone for many women already. So, if doctors can't perform the procedure, or clinics can't keep their doors open...
