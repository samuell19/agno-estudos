(suspenseful music) (mumbling) - David, where's Paul? - I don't know, Mr. Douglas. - Howard, take charge. I'll go find Paul. - Yes sir, Mr. Douglas. (chattering) - Paul, why don't you stay with the group? - I know him. - [Mr. Douglas] You do? - [Paul] It's Bigfoot. - There's no such creature as Bigfoot. Read the card. It tells you that no such creature as Bigfoot has ever been found. - I met him last summer. - Where? - Up north in the woods where I go to visit my father every summer. - That's right, your father's a forest ranger. Did your father meet him too? - No, just me. - Would you like to tell me about the meeting? - I was fishing by a waterfall when I heard this noise from a cave and there he was. - Him? - Yep. - What did he say? - He didn't say anything but he looked friendly so I gave him a piece of candy. - And then what? - He liked it so I gave him another piece and then he gave me this. - That's beautiful, Paul. Did you ever see him again? - Yeah, sure, lots of times. I used to bring him coca-cola. He loved coca-cola. Then I brought him my radio and showed him how to play it. - Oh you did, did you? What kind of music did he like? - Same as me, rock and roll. - What did your father have to say about these meetings? - [Paul] I never told him. - Why not? - Because it was a secret between me and Bigfoot. You know how grown ups are. - Like me, huh? - Yeah, like you. Grown ups don't believe in anything. - Get back with the other boys, Paul. I'll talk to you later. Are you hungry, Paul? - I'm starving, Mr. Douglas. - [Mr. Douglas] The other boys are eating dinner. Would you like to join them? - Sure. - Huh-uh. Before you eat, I think we should have a little understanding, don't you? - About what? - About telling lies. - I didn't lie, Mr. Douglas. - You still insist that you met Bigfoot? - Yes sir. - All you have to say is you made it up and then you go to the dining room. - [Paul] That would be lying, Mr. Douglas. - You're making me put you in a report to the principal. - Please don't do that, Mr. Douglas. - Then tell me the truth. - I told you the truth. Why won't you believe me? - Go have your dinner. Paul! You're in big trouble, young man. Bigfoot! (tense music) - [Voice] Paul! Wake up, Paul! Paul! Paul! Your father is in great danger, Paul! He needs your help! Hurry, Paul! - Paul, what are you doing? - My father's in danger, he needs my help. - How do you know that? - Bigfoot told me. He's out there. Come on, I'll show you. - There ain't no Bigfoot, you dreamt it. - He came from far away to warn me. I've gotta go. Hello Mr. Douglas. - Go back to sleep, David. I heard what you said to David, Paul. We can't have you spreading lies all over the school. This is a fine school. You're here on a scholarship. It's our job to teach you about the real world you'll live in someday. You're too old to believe in fairy tales. You're always making up stories. That's why you're always in trouble. Well it's out of my hands now! In the morning, the principal will decide whether or not you'll be expelled! - Now you did it, dummy. (howling) (growling) (barking) - Come on, men! (mumbling) Don't let it get away! (yelling) - I'm the law in the forest and I wanna take it alive. - I'm the sheriff in this county. That includes the forest. We've been hunting this animal for two weeks now. We've got it, let's kill it. - No one's ever seen the beast! How do you know what you're killing? - We know it's big and dangerous. We saw a deer it killed. Tore it apart. I've never seen anything like it. That's enough for me. (howling) (chattering) - Jim, did you see anything? - I didn't see a thing. - That-a-way. I told you to shoot, you let it get away. Go after it, men! Hurry up! Where are you going? Wait a minute! What are you gonna do about it? - Sheriff. Jim and I tracked the beast for two weeks. We finally got it trapped and you and your boys let it get away. - Now we have to track it all over again, sheriff. - You'd better because if that beast kills anyone, you're finished, Mr. Cooper! You'll never work here or at any other forest again! You'll wind up (mumbling) with the city! I'm going to find it and kill it. ♪ 'Cause I'm a boy from the northwest ♪ ♪ And I'm proud, don't you know? ♪ (muffled lyrics) (horn honking) (barking) - Hop in, kid. ♪ Well I'm a boy from the northwest ♪ ♪ And I'm proud, don't you know? ♪ ♪ I'm a boy from the northwest ♪ ♪ Frigid Idaho ♪ (muffled lyrics) ♪ Well hell, I don't know ♪ ♪ But I'm still proud to be one ♪ ♪ From frigid Idaho ♪ - Can you go any faster? - [Driver] Not on these roads, kid. (ambient music) (howling) (dramatic music) (howling) - Dad! - Paul. - [Paul] Dad! - Paul. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be at school. - You okay, dad? - I'm fine. - [Paul] You sure you're okay? - Okay buster, what's your story? - [Paul] You won't believe it, dad. - Better make it good. - Last night someone woke me up and told me you were in great danger. - [Dad] Who woke you up? - Bigfoot. - [Dad] Paul. - I told you you wouldn't believe me. - Paul! - Now you're mad at me. - I wish there was a Bigfoot so I could strangle him. - But dad, I saw him right through my window on the school lawn. - He talked to you? - He always talks to me. - Let's go. Monday morning you're going back to school. Is that clear? Don't argue with me, young man. Listen to me. I'll have no more of your stories. I've told you again and again about telling these lies. (gentle music) Yesterday I found a couple of raccoon cubs. - I thought raccoons never left their cubs. - This one did. - Where are the coons now? - In my cabin. I was kind of saving it as a surprise for you. - I love you, dad. Look, a bobcat! - Paul, Paul! Paul! Paul! (tweeting) (laughing) - Hello Jim. - Good boy, Paul. Welcome home, Paul. Let's go. (laughing) (roaring) - [Paul] What's that? - [Jim] Quiet, Paul. - [Paul] You're going to kill it? - [Jim] No, I'm going to shoot it with a tranquilizer. It's only a cougar. - Let's get out of here, Jim. - You're right, let's leave him here for now. We'll come back for him later. (eerie music) (howling) Oh, you bum. Do you know you scared me? - [Paul] It's a wolf. - Now we'll have to come back for this one too. (barking) - There's something inside my cabin. (grunting) Make yourself at home. - I have. Help yourself. Got plenty to spare. - Where are my raccoons? - Are these your raccoons? Sure taste delicious. (glass shattering) (gentle music) (laughing) (laughing) - Ow! Let it go! Dad! - Let it go! This is government property. What are you doing here, anyway? - Cool it, ranger. Name is Morgan Hicks. I'm a US government marshal. I hear you got a little trouble down here. I came here to eliminate it. - [Jim] We don't need that kind of help. - I think you do, chief. - What do you have in mind? - Bang. - This is my territory. Nobody does any shooting without my permission. - I get my orders from your higher ups. You wanna check it out with headquarters? Name is Morgan Hicks. Occupation, big game hunter. I've tracked and killed all over the world. - It's about time you got here, Morgan. I see your animal's still running around loose. Lucky for you, no one's been killed yet. Are you aware that the 12 Pines Summer Resort opens its season Monday? That over 500 people are scheduled to arrive? - What? The season doesn't open for another two weeks. - The preseason convention. - Then we have to go to the hotel to warn Mr. Wagoner to keep all the guests inside while we capture the animal. - Wagoner is the mayor, the richest man in the state. He sneezes and we all catch pneumonia. The only animal he wants to hear about is a dead one. I told you to kill it! I recommended you for this job! - I'll kill it, sheriff, just as soon as I find it. - He's a big animal! What's so hard to find? - Don't you understand? This beast is intelligent. A lot smarter than most people. He always knows where we've been and we're not gonna take him by surprise. - Then how? - Gotta wait til he's hungry enough to take chances. By stalking him, we don't give him a chance to hunt. - [Sheriff] That could go on for days. - Maybe weeks. I remember in Rangoon I hunted down a man-eater all summer til I found out he was a little careless. - You got any more bright ideas, Jim? (beeping) - Will Cooper here, over. - [Male] Is the sheriff there, over. - Give me that. - Yes sir, we're all here, Mr. Wagoner. - [Mr. Wagoner] I want all of you at my hotel first thing in the morning. Over and out. - You heard the man. See you at the hotel first thing in the morning. (howling) - Come in, kid, it's your room. - [Paul] What do you do with all these guns? - [Morgan] I make my living. - Killing? - No, sometimes I catch 'em alive and sell 'em to the zoos. - Where? - Allover. The rain forest in the Amazon. Jungles in Africa. And mainly in India. You've heard of India, haven't you, kid? - Sure. I'm not ignorant. You ever run across Bigfoot? - [Morgan] Bigfoot? No, why? - What would you do if you met him? - [Morgan] It depends. - You wouldn't shoot him, would you? - You seen him? - [Paul] Maybe. - Tell me more, kid. - How do I know I can trust you? - I'm here to help your father, alright? - My father's in great danger. - [Morgan] He is? - [Paul] That's why I'm here. - Yeah. This is Bigfoot country. You have seen him, haven't you? - You got too many guns, mister. Don't worry, dad, I'll save you. - I love you, son. - I love you too, dad. - Okay, let's go to bed now. Go to sleep, Paul. - Goodnight, dad. - Goodnight, son. (screaming) - Mr. Wagoner! We're here, sir! - What took you so long? - We were at the hotel looking for you, sir. How wonderful! We love your new museum! - You wanna put me out of business, Will, why don't you take out your gun and shoot me? That'll close the hotel. - All I'm trying to do is prevent a disaster. - My disaster. Sheriff, if some crazy animal's out there, get him. - Yes sir, Mr. Wagoner. - What are you doing still standing here? Go get him, boys. - You don't understand, Mr. Wagoner. - Make me understand. - It's not a crazy beast. It's just some animal we don't have any experience with. - You close one road, if you open your mouth in front of one hotel guest, I'll have all of your jobs. You're supposed to be a big game hunter? Go hunt! You call yourself an Indian. You can't even trap a wild animal. Some Indian. - Hi, dear. I can't make the martinis without any olives. - Get them the canoe. Go in the forest and get him! I want that animal's head hanging from my wall in 24 hours! (tense music) - [Paul Voiceover] Last summer, I was fishing by a waterfall and that's how I met Bigfoot, Mr. Douglas. - Will. There's the cave I was telling you about. - You're right, Jim. I don't remember seeing this cave before. - Well. Let's go. - No, I don't wanna go in there! - Paul, you gotta stay with me. - I don't wanna go in there. - Son, stop it. - No! - Son, let's go. - No! (yelling) - [Morgan] I'll check over in the woods. - [Will] Someone sure liked coca-cola. - [Jim] I never knew an animal that could open cans. We'd better take a good look around here. - [Paul] I brought the cans here last summer when I was fishing by the waterfall. I only drank one a day, dad. - I couldn't crush one of these. Not like this. - A bear could, couldn't he, dad? - Not like this. It wasn't an animal. Someone's been living here. - Yeah. Someone who likes coca-cola. I'll go check upstairs. - You can't go up there! - It'll be alright, Paul. - Paul, I want you to wait here, right here. - Hey, look what I found! (rock music) It's rock and roll music! - Hey, isn't that the radio I gave you last year for Christmas? - Oh yeah! I've been looking all over for that. Must have left it here last summer. - Well Paul. - [Paul] Did you find anything up there, Jim? - Nah, just another dead end. - Let's go, there's nothing here. (howling) You should have left him in the cabin. - He's safer with me. - [Paul] I don't know if I like you, mister. - Very few people do. I've got a dirty job to do, kid. (dramatic music) (roaring) - Hey Paul! (laughing) That's old Big Mike. (laughing) (laughing) (gun firing) (roaring) (howling) (dramatic music) A poacher. His poaching days are over. - [Will] Let's check over there, Jim. - Let's keep this a secret between you and me, huh, kid? (howling) - [Paul] This bird is sick. We've got to take it to Helen's place. - You got her here just in time. Another day and she would have died. - Never seen your cages so full before, doc. - You've gotta catch that animal before the whole forest panics. Hi, Shasta. How are you feeling, huh? How you feeling? - Sure help if we knew what we were looking for. - Well, what do you think, Jim? - I just don't know, Helen. Maybe I spent too many years in college and not enough time in the forest. - Can I go look at the other animals, Helen? - Sure, go ahead Paul. - Thanks. - Son, stay where I can keep an eye on you. - Alright dad. - Oh, what you got, girl? You feeling better? You feeling better? (growling) (snarling) - Ah shut up! (howling) - This is our secret, boy. - Paul, come back and finish your dinner please. (barking) (snarling) - The deer's gone! - It would take a powerful animal to tear this cage apart. - Look at these tracks. - You know, there are two sets of tracks. What do you make of this, Morgan? - We may be hunting more than one animal here. (yelling) (yelling) - Hey. I'm the ranger in this forest. This area is closed to everybody, period. What are you doing here? - We had a rumble with another biker gang and they chased us clear across the state line and we don't know where we're at. - Hey, you got a cigarette, man? - You light up in this forest and I'll put you away for good. - [Morgan] You guys seen anything around here? - Like what? - Like a bear. (laughing) - You guys seen any teddy bears? (laughing) - You can't stay here. - Give us a break, man. - There's a dangerous animal on the loose, man. You'd better get out of here. All of you, right now. - What if me and my two little brothers here don't? - I've lost track of all the things I've killed. You want me to add three more animals to my list? - Nah man, that's cool. - You'd better be gone by the time I get back or I'm gonna run you in, savvy? - Comprende, senor. - Let's go. - I'll be back, boys. You can count on it. - Boy scouts. (yelling) (growling) - [Male] Let's hit the road. - We should have (mumbling) - Yeah! - Are you guys nuts? They're gonna have our heads from (mumbling). - I ain't going nowhere til I'm damn good and ready. (yelling) - Let's get our bikes, man. - Right behind you. - Til I'm good and ready! (yelling) (motors revving) (yelling) (screaming) (dramatic music) - Where is he? - He must be around here some place. (yelling) - Paul! (roaring) - [Morgan] Will, cover this end. Jim, you come with me. - Paul, go hide behind those rocks. (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) - You didn't get him, did you? - No, he went over the rocks. - Look, he's going down the gully. That must be the tiger that escaped from the circus. It's a dead end! He's gotta come back through here. We've got him now. - Jim. Take Paul to the bus station. He's going back to school. - I have to stay with you! - Let the kid stay. - Keep out of this. Paul, go with Jim. - You don't understand! Send me away and you'll be killed! Please dad. I love you. - I love you too, son. That's why I have to send you away. - Come on, Paul. - No! Dad! No, dad! - [Jim] Paul, no! - Dad! - Enough Paul, please! Do I have to tie you up? - You're nothing but a dumb Indian! - If I was smart, I wouldn't have to chase bad boys in the woods. - You send me back to school, you're killing my father. - If I don't, he'll kill me. - I'm not joking. My father's in great danger. Bigfoot warned me. - What did you say? - Bigfoot warned me. - There is no Bigfoot. He's a fairy tale, Paul. You're too old to believe in fairy tales. - He's for real. I met him last summer in the cave. I brought the coca-colas. I gave him the radio. And he's still there, I saw him when we were in the cave. Boy, are you dumb. - Let's move. (tense music) Paul! Okay Paul! I know you're in there! Come on out! You'd better come out, Paul! Ah! I want you to wait here and don't move. Come on. (growling) Red Hawk. - Hello Jim. - [Jim] Red Hawk, is that you? - You remember me, don't you? - You died 13 years ago. I saw you sealed up in a cave. - I was. After seven days I had a vision. All the animals in the forest needed me so I got up, broke out of the cave. I've been here since with my friends. Hi boy. Come closer. I'd like to speak to the boy alone. - [Jim] Don't run away. - How are you, bub? - Hello Red Hawk. - What's that around your neck? That's beautiful. Where'd you get this stone? - Bigfoot gave it to me. - Bigfoot? (laughing) Bigfoot gave me one of those stones too. How is Bigfoot? - There's a big game hunter who knows he's here. - I know. Did they catch the tiger? - They got him trapped in a gully. - They mustn't kill the tiger. - My father won't let them. - Your father's a good man. He understands that people shouldn't kill the animals off or man will die. God made man, the beasts, the forest. One can't live without the other. Do you believe in this? - Yes sir, Red Hawk. I believe. - When you grow up, would you still believe this? - Why won't I? - You'll forget. Grown ups don't believe in anything but themselves. - Red Hawk, I'll never forget. - Good. Now go down, tell Bigfoot he must leave the forest. There's too many people around. He must leave for the mountains. - I can't, they're sending me to school tonight and Jim's out there waiting for me. - There's another way out over there, take it. Now go. - Thanks Red Hawk. - Go. Run! (barking) (dramatic music) (shouting) (screaming) (gun firing) (laughing) - Get me out of here! - Dumb Indian, huh? - [Paul] Let me go! Stop it! Get me out of here! - Helen, I'll have to borrow your Jeep to take Paul to the bus station. Will wants him back in school. - Did you have to tie him up? - He keeps running away! Feed him, will you, and I'll go gas up the jeep. - Murderer! Jim and you are killing my father. - How's that? - You don't believe. - Believe what? - Bigfoot! He's out there and he's alive. He warned me that my father's in danger and he wouldn't lie. You don't believe me, do you? - I want to believe you but why would Bigfoot do this for you? - Because he's my friend. You won't let Jim take me away, will you, Helen? - [Jim] Come on, Paul, let's go. - No! - [Radio] Radio one calling. Radio one, over. - [Jim] This is (mumbling) two receiving you, Will, over. - [Will] Get the jeep, Jim, and meet me at squadron 847. Repeat, squadron 847, confirm? - Got you, Will. Quadrant 847, over and out. And don't let Paul out of here until I get back. - That was my father on the radio. I told you he's in danger. You've got to take me to him. - Now look, Jim is on his way. He can do more than we can do. Wait! Where do you think you're going? You don't know where to find him. - But you do! Take me to him, please! Please. - Alright, we'll take the truck. - You let me shoot first with the tranquilizer. You don't fire unless I miss. - Let's get this tiger hunt over with. I'm looking for bigger game. - What do you mean? - I'm sitting on a fortune right here in this forest, now. Right here. - There's no gold in these woods. - You just can't see it. But it's mine, all mine, and I'm not sharing it with anybody. - Share what? - I'm capturing the greatest game on earth. I'm gonna kill it, I'm gonna stuff it, and I'm gonna travel with it all over the world. People will pay a fortune just to get one look. - A tiger? - Bigfoot. He's right here in these woods. Your own kid tried to tell you but you're too late. There's nothing like him and he belongs to me. - You saw him? - His tracks. Fresh, a day old. - Tracks can be deceiving. I've been fooled more than once. - You are a fool, ranger. Right under your nose. - Okay, Morgan, look. Bigfoot's yours. The million dollar fairy tale is yours but right now let's take the tiger. - Okay, ranger. Let's end it right now. (growling) (suspenseful music) There he goes. (gun firing) Got away again. - Only one way out of this canyon, that's ghost town. - Dr. Foster here, over. - [Male] The tiger you're hunting escaped from a circus. Try to take him alive but if there's any danger to anyone you have permission to shoot him. Over and out. - [Helen] Oh no. - [Paul] What happened? - [Helen] We've run out of gas. (growling) (glass breaking) (screaming) (gun firing) (dramatic music) - Jim, you stay here. Morgan and I will flush him out. - Okay Will, here. - [Will] Paul, stay in the jeep and don't get up. (roaring) - [Helen] Paul, come back here! (roaring) - Dad! (roaring) Dad? (roaring) Dad? Dad! - Paul! (roaring) Paul! (growling) (gun firing) He's alright. Well, we'd better tie him up before the tranquilizer wears off. - Bigfoot! (laughing) (upbeat music) Bigfoot, I'm so glad I found you. Bigfoot. You can't stay here. Morgan knows about you. He'll kill you. Red Hawk says you must go up to the mountains where no one can ever find you. - Where's Paul? - [Will] I'll look for him. You and Morgan help Helen with the tiger. Paul! - Bigfoot! Run, run before they shoot you! Run Bigfoot! Dad? - Paul! - Dad! - Paul. (yelling) (rumbling) - [Paul] Dad! Dad. - Help me, Paul. Help me. - I'll get you out, dad. Bigfoot! Help me! Bigfoot! Bigfoot! Help me, please! Please! (grunting) Bigfoot! You okay? - You were right all along, kid. (suspenseful music) (howling) (snarling) (barking) (screaming) - [Helen] Here it is, boys. - [Paul] Oh, how nice. - Turkey, huh? Ain't even Thanksgiving. (growling) - Maybe the tiger's hungry. - You sit down and eat. (laughing) Mama came back for the rest of her family. Jim, get the other raccoon. - They're mine! - No, son. They're not. - Okay, dad. - [Will] Paul. - [Group] Merry Christmas, Mr. Douglas. - Have a nice vacation. Place your exams on my desk as you leave. Paul. You stay. Paul, your father wrote me a long letter. He explained everything that happened. The rules of this school do not permit the teaching of fairy tales. Personally, they've always fascinated me. Pinocchio's my favorite. When you go on vacation next summer, would you mind if I came along? I would like to meet this Bigfoot. You think you could arrange it, Paul? - Bigfoot went up into the mountains. - I'm sure he'd come down for you. - But you, you're a grown up. - So what? - Grown ups can't see him. - Sad, isn't it? - Yes sir. Of course, if you believe, truly believe, it doesn't matter how old you are.
