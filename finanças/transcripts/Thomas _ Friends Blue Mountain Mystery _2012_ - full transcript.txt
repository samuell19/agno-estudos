( Steam Whistle Blasting ) Storyteller: It was a busy day on the island of Sodor. At the Blue Mountain Quarry, the narrow gauge engines were working hard. ( Steam Whistles Blasting ) Good morning, Rheneas! Morning, Merrick! Good morning, Peter Sam! ( Toot-Toot-Toot ) Good morning, Merrick! Owen, the incline engine, was waiting for Paxton the diesel. Paxton was collecting heavy cars of slate to take to Brendam Docks. ( Horn Blows ) Ready when you are, Owen! Load me up, Rusty! Going down! Next stop... right to the bottom! ( Thud! ) (♪ Music ♪) ( Steam Whistle Blasting ) Do you always work this hard at the quarry, Skarloey? Always! If your wheels aren't whirring, you aren't being a really useful engine! ( Toot-toot ) Paxton started to whir his wheels again... Peter Sam: Look out! Oh my! Then, he stopped. What was that, Peter Sam? High above in the quarry, a giant keystone in Blondin Bridge had come loose. Fenders and fireboxes! Blondin Bridge isn't safe! Ohh, Rheneas is on his way down from the upper terrace! He'll have to cross the bridge with heavy cars. We must warn him! Sound the alarm! ( Siren Blares ) All the engines were suddenly still. All the engines were hushed. All the engines watched. Rheneas heard the siren. Oh no! There must be danger! But he didn't know why the siren was sounding... There he is! ...until it was too late! ( Engine Chugging Quickly ) Stop! Stop! Rheneas tried to stop! Workman: Blondin Bridge is falling down! Storyteller: But his heavy cars pushed him on... Whoa! ...right onto the damaged bridge! Whoa... ah! Rheneas pumped his pistons as never before! He had to puff across before the bridge collapsed! ( Stones Crashing ) ( Whistle Blasting ) Rheneas was almost knocked off the rails! Whoaaaa! Oooooooh! Whoaaaa! Oof! Whooaaaa! (♪ Fast-Paced Music ♪) At last, Rheneas rolled to a stop, right by Skarloey! Oh! I'm all right! I made it down safely. ( Laughs ) ( Engines Laugh ) ( Cheering ) Paxton: Ahhhh... umm... uh... Excuse me, um, but I wonder if, uh... someone could help me? M-maybe? Please? ( Thump ) Oww! (♪ Lively Orchestral Music ♪) (♪ Light Orchestral Music ♪) Storyteller: Blue Mountain Mystery. On Thomas' branchline, the sun was shining, the birds were singing, and Thomas was having fun with Annie and Clarabel. ( Laughing ) Hold on tight! ( Toot-Toot-Toot! ) Clattering carriages! Slow down, Thomas! Slow down, slow down! The signal is red! I always slow down when I come to a red signal! Only because we tell you to! Only because we keep you on track! ( Laughs ) You worry too much! Suddenly, Thomas, Annie and Clarabel heard the strangest sound! ( Honking ) Cinders and ashes! What's that? Around the bend came a small red car on the tracks. He was carrying Sir Topham Hatt! ( Sir Hatt Muttering ) Thomas was surprised! Sir Topham Hatt: Winston, please stoppp!!! ( Sir Hatt Gasping & Muttering ) Wait there a moment, Thomas! I need to talk to you. ( Engine Revs ) ( Sir Hatt Muttering ) Good morning, Thomas! This is Winston! He is my new track inspection car! ( Honk-Honk-Honk! ) Good morning, Winston! Nice to meet you! Nice to meet you, Thomas! Thomas, I have a special job for you. Paxton has been in an accident at the Blue Mountain Quarry. I have arranged with Mr. Percival to send you to work in his place. Your job will be to take loaded slate cars to the docks. Thank you, sir! I like working with my narrow gauge friends! Toby will take over on your branchline! But before you go, you must deliver the rest of these passengers! Of course, sir! ( Winston's Gears Grinding ) Winston, we must hurry. Today is a busy day. ( Engine Sputtering ) Not to worry. It's early days yet. That's right, sir. Early days. Of course, sir! Winston: Bye, Thomas! ( Honk-Honk! ) Good-bye, Winston! ( Laughing ) Thomas liked Winston already. So did Annie and Clarabel! We have a new friend! Annie & Clarabel: We like Winston! ( All Laughing ) Emily was taking Paxton to the Dieselworks. I'm sorry you were in an accident, Paxton! It must have been horrible! Oh, it's not so bad, Emily. A biff and a bash, that's all. ( Toot-Toot-Toot! ) Then Thomas came hurrying along the track. Hello, Emily! Hello, Paxton. Are you all right? Just a biff and a bash, Thomas, that's all. They'll soon fix me up when I get to the Dieselworks. I'm sure they will, Paxton. Good luck! I must hurry. They're waiting for me up at the Blue Mountain Quarry. ( Toot-Toot-Toot! ) Be careful up there, Thomas! But Thomas was already far away. Thomas was excited Sir Topham Hatt had given him the job of working with the narrow gauge engines. By the time he reached the Blue Mountain Quarry, he had almost forgotten about Paxton. ( Toot-Toot-Toot! ) And then Thomas saw what had happened to the bridge. Thomas: Oh my! Hellooo, Thomas! ( Whistles Tooting ) The narrow gauge engines were much smaller than Thomas. Hello, Thomas! They ran on narrow rails. Hello, Thomas! ( Toooot, Toot-Toot! ) Hello, my friends! Rheneas! What happened? Were you in an accident too? Well, I did get a few extra scrapes and scratches, Thomas. Actually I could really use a fresh-- It could have been worse. Luckily, Rheneas is still safe and in good working order, ready for-- --A fresh coat of paint? ( Laughter ) As I was saying... ready for work! Thomas: Okay, Skarloey! I'm ready to huff my hardest! Just show me what I need to do.

As night fell, he chuffed happily away to Brendam Docks. ( Toot-Toot! ) That night, Thomas slept soundly at Tidmouth Sheds and his little friends slept soundly in the hills. The next morning, Thomas went back to work at the Blue Mountain Quarry. He was shunting cars. Thomas heard a rattle from inside the tunnel. Suddenly, a small green engine darted out, an engine that Thomas had never seen before! ( Toot-Toot-Toot! ) Hello, I'm Thomas. But the engine didn't answer. Cinders and ashes! How strange! ( Whistle Blasting ) Good morning, Thomas! Good morning, Sir Handel. I've just seen a little green engine racing from one tunnel to another. Who is he? Well, now, um... Uh, as sure as these hills are high, um, I-I don't know. It was probably a runaway car, Thomas. There are lots of those up here. ( Whoo-Whoo-Whoo! ) Thomas was even more puzzled. I'm sure that wasn't a runaway car! ( Brakes Screech ) Later, Thomas saw the green engine again! Rheneas! ( Toot-Toot! ) Who is that little green engine? Engine? What engine? Don't know! Very busy! Can't stop, lots to do. ( Rheneas' Whistle Blowing ) This is very strange. Hello! ( Toot-Toot! ) Please stop! Who are you? But the engine didn't stop and the engine didn't talk. Thomas couldn't follow the little green engine along the narrow gauge rails. His wheels were too big. ( Rusty's Horn Blares ) Rusty, do you know a little green engine? I think-- I'm sure I think-- It was a mountain goat. It wasn't a mountain goat. It was an engine! Ho, I'm afraid I can't help then! ( Rusty's horn blares ) Thomas was even more puzzled. Merrick! ( Loud Snores ) ( Toot! ) Wake up, sleepy-crane! Huh? What? Have I missed something? Merrick, do you know a little green engine? No, Thomas. And, uh, I think it's my nap time. ( Snores ) ( Chuckles ) Owen! Can you help me? Have you seen a strange green engine that pops in and out of tunnels? This quarry is full of engines that pop in and out of tunnels! Going down! Next stop: quarry floor! No one wants to talk to me! Then, Thomas saw the green engine again. Wait! Little engine! Please, who are you? The green engine stared at Thomas. And then he hurried away again. Hurry, Luke! But Thomas didn't want to lose him this time! ( Gasps ) I'm sorry, Luke! Oh my! ( Crash! ) Oh no! Hello, Luke! You're in a hurry! ( Gasps ) Oh, help! Luke! Over here! ( Whistle Blares ) Ohhh! ( Whistle Blowing ) Thomas had lost the green engine. He was upset! Thomas: Skarloey, who is Luke? Why does he keep puffing away? Why will none of you talk to me about him? He's a friend, Thomas. I'm a friend! Why won't you tell me who he is? Then I can be his friend too. The quarry was still and silent. Owen stopped working. And even Merrick woke up! Yes, Thomas. You are our friend. And so we will trust you. ( Engines Whistle In Agreement ) What I am going to tell you, no one else must know. Luke hides here, in the Blue Mountain Quarry, because he is scared. Why? Because once, long ago, Luke did something very bad. He thinks that if anyone finds him, he will be sent away from Sodor forever. Sent away? That's right, Thomas. Sent away! So, here in the Blue Mountain Quarry, we make sure that our friend Luke always stays hidden. That way, no one will find him and he won't be sent away. What did Luke do that was so bad? You know enough now, Thomas. And remember, everything you've heard, you must keep locked in your funnel. In the tunnel, two eyes blinked, and disappeared into the darkness. That evening, Thomas was taking cars of slate to the docks. His axles ached and his wheels were weary, but Thomas didn't mind. His boiler was bubbling with thoughts of Luke. Why does Luke have to hide away like that? Why is he so scared of being found? What could he have done that could be bad enough to be sent away from Sodor? ( Signal Clangs ) Thomas had to find out what Luke had done. He wanted to know the whole story. (♪ Quiet Music ♪) ( Engine Chugging ) What's the matter, Thomas? You haven't said hello. I'm sorry, Percy. I was thinking. What about? Thomas had to be careful. He couldn't talk about Luke, even to his best friend. What do you all think is the worst thing an engine could do? Something really bad. One of the worst things that I've ever done was when... I was trying to sneak up on the coaches and I crashed right into Sir Topham Hatt's baggage trolley. Baggage, clothes, and sticky jam flew up into the air, and fell over me and Sir Topham Hatt! He was very cross with me. Henry: You didn't mean to crash into the baggage trolley, Percy. It was an accident. I think what I did was far worse. I refused to leave the tunnel because I didn't want to get my paint wet in the rain. Sir Topham Hatt was really cross. So cross, in fact, he walled me up in the tunnel. That was bad. Do you remember the day I was shunting cars at the mine? I knew that I shouldn't chuff past the danger sign, but I wanted to see what would happen if I did. I steamed right past it into a siding and fell down into the mine! ( Frantic Chugging ) That was very bad! But not bad enough to be sent away from Sodor forever! Forever? That would be terrible. Unthinkable! What about Diesel? He pushed the logs off the bridge and into the sea! ( Crashing & Splashing ) But even he wasn't sent away from Sodor. The engines fell silent. Then, as the stars twinkled over Tidmouth Sheds, one by one, the engines fell asleep... all except Thomas. Don't worry, Luke. I'll find a way to help you. The next morning, the Blue Mountain Quarry was busy. Rocky was lifting and loading the stones from the broken Blondin Bridge. I don't like these scrapes and scratches. They make me look... Old? ( Giggles ) Clumsy? Ha-ha-ha! They make you look like a really useful engine... that needs... Together: A new coat of paint! ( Both Laughing ) Then Thomas arrived. ( Toot-Toot! ) Skarloey! I've asked all my friends. We're sure there is nothing an engine could do that is bad enough to be sent away from Sodor! Thomas, have you talked to the other engines about Luke? No! I told you I wouldn't do that. I'm trying to help Luke. I want to be his friend. From inside the tunnel, steam swirled and two eyes watched. Skarloey: Very well, Thomas. Puff along now! ( Toot-Toot! ) (♪ Upbeat Music ♪) ( Toot-Toot-Toot-Toot! ) Rocky, watch out! Stop, Skarloey! ( Whoooo! ) Ohh! Sorry, Skarloey! Oh, that was close! Fenders and fireboxes! Oh, thank you, Thomas! Happy to help, Skarloey! You saved me from losing my cab. You are a good friend! Thomas smiled. And that made all the other engines, and Luke, smile at Thomas. (♪ Quiet Music ♪) Oh! Hello, Luke! Hello, Thomas! I'm sorry I hid from you. I didn't know you and I was scared. But now... Well, I wonder, would you be my friend? I'd like that, Luke. I'd like that very much.

( Honk-Honk-Honk! ) Luke darted away again. ( Honk-Honk! ) It was Winston! This time he was carrying Mr. Percival and Sir Topham Hatt. ( Sir Topham Hatt Groaning ) ( Honk-Honk! ) Hello, Thomas! I have news for you. Paxton is now fixed. Thank you for your work, Thomas. Paxton will now take over again. And you will return to your branchline. Yes, sir. ( Honk-Honk-Honk! ) Thomas was sad. He wanted to stay with Luke, but he couldn't now. Luke... ( Toot-Toot! ) Please puff out! You don't have to hide from me. We're friends now. Why do you keep hiding, Luke? Skarloey told me that you are scared you will be sent away from Sodor. I'm sure you won't be! But, Thomas, I did something very bad. I've done bad things too, Luke. We all have. Once I steamed past a danger sign and fell into a mine! And I'm still here! ( Both Giggling ) Thomas and Luke were so busy talking that they didn't notice Paxton had come back to the quarry. Luke: I'll tell you what I did, Thomas, but no one else must know. I promise, Luke. Don't worry. A long time ago, I was sent to Sodor to work at the Blue Mountain Quarry. My boiler bubbled with excitement. It was my dream to work on Sodor! There was a yellow engine on the boat. He came from far away, and he spoke a different language... Yellow Engine: Hola. ¿Adónde vas? ¿Vas a Sodor? Luke: ...a language I couldn't understand! ( Ship's Horn Blasts ) ( Seagulls Cawing ) ( Waves Crashing ) A storm was coming in. The sea was rough. But I was happy! I could see Sodor! I couldn't wait to be lifted onto the rails. At Brendam Docks, there was hustle and bustle. Cranes clanked, dock men shouted. Line that up and lock it off! The men wanted to lift the yellow engine off, but I wanted to be the first off the boat. Take me off first! Please! Please! The dock men agreed and I was happy! Yellow Engine: ¡Tengo un problema! But then... What, Luke? I knocked the yellow engine into the sea! ( Gasp! ) How? Luke: I just bumped into him and sent him splashing into the sea! ( Splashing ) The sound was terrible! I had to go the Steamworks to be fixed. I heard the storm thunder outside, but I could only think about the yellow engine in the sea. ( Thunderclap ) He was there for a very long time. By the time they lifted him out, he was rusty and ruined! The yellow engine was never seen again. He must have been taken to the smelter's yard! He couldn't be really useful anymore, and it was all because I wanted to go first. It was my fault! If I had waited my turn, Thomas, I would never have knocked him into the sea! But, Luke, that was a long time ago. I'm still scared, Thomas. My narrow gauge friends know I'm here, but I'm sure if the other engines find me, they'll tell Mr. Percival. And he'll tell Sir Topham Hatt. And they'll both send me away from Sodor forever! Come along, Paxton! What are you standing there for? Get those wheels whirring! ( Bashing ) Paxton! Oh my! What are you doing here? Paxton: Oh, uh... h-hello, Thomas! I've-- um, I've-- Well, I've come to take slate to the docks. That's my job again. Sir Topham Hatt told me. ( Nervous Laugh ) Uh... ahem. ( Horn Blares ) Excuse me. Luke? Luke? Please come out to say goodbye. But Luke didn't come out. And he didn't say goodbye. Luke was scared. And Thomas knew why. I'm sorry, Luke. I have to go back to my branchline now, but I will come back. Remember, Luke, I am your friend. Storyteller: As Thomas chuffed out of the Blue Mountain Quarry, he knew he had to help his new friend Luke. The next morning, on Thomas' branchline, the sun was shining. The birds were singing... But Thomas wasn't smiling. He was too busy thinking about Luke. Clattering carriages! Slow down! Stop! We've overrun the signal, Thomas! Oh! I'm sorry! Huh! Silly me! Silly you! Annie: Clever us! Then, Thomas saw Toby. Thank you for helping out on my branchline, Toby! Happy to help, Thomas! Could you help me again? I'm happy to help again, Thomas. But I am a little busy. Please? I have to do something very important. So Thomas was uncoupled from Annie. Thank you, Toby! ( Toot-Toot! ) Where are you going? Clarabel: What are you doing? When will you be back? But Thomas was already too far away to hear. Thomas! ( Bell Dinging ) Oh dear. Come on, then, Annie and Clarabel, let's get to work! ( Bell Dinging ) Together: We're right behind you, Toby! ( Laughing ) Thomas had an idea. Maybe I can find that yellow engine! Maybe I can find out what really happened. An engine can't just disappear! So Thomas looked all over Sodor for the yellow engine. He searched at Knapford Station. He searched the shunting yards. ( Seagull Cawing ) He searched on all the coastal tracks. And he even searched at the garbage dump. But he found no yellow engine. Hello, Thomas. Edward! I'm looking for an old yellow engine. Have you seen one? No, Thomas, I haven't. You could try the Dieselworks. Thank you, Edward. I will! ( Toot-Toot! ) Thomas? Why are you looking for an old yellow engine? But, once more, Thomas was already too far away to hear. At the entrance to the Dieselworks, Thomas looked for a yellow engine. There were lots of engine parts, but none of them were yellow. And then Thomas heard something that made his boiler run cold. Paxton: And that's when Luke knocked the yellow engine into the sea, and the yellow engine was never seen again! ( Gasp! ) Paxton was telling devious Diesel all about Luke! You are right to tell me, Paxton. We don't want an engine like that on our island! He could knock one of us into the sea next. It could be you! ( Gasps ) Oh my! We'll find Sir Topham Hatt and he'll tell Mr. Percival. And together, they'll make sure Luke leaves Sodor forever! Who's there? Thomas! We must hurry, Paxton. Thomas is a tricky tank engine! Whatever he's doing, we must be there before him. Oh my! ( Chug-Chug-Chug-Chug... ) I don't know where else to look! Somebody must know what happened to the yellow engine. Maybe somebody at Brendam Docks! Somebody like... Cranky! ( Toot-Toot-Toot! ) Thomas raced into Brendam Docks. His pistons pumped. ( Toooot! ) Cranky, I need your help. Do you remember a yellow engine that fell in the sea? I'm busy. ( Toot! ) Please, Cranky! This is important! Lots of things are important, Thomas. Dock Man: Okay! Up and away! Up! Take it up! Keep going! Cranky, did you lift a yellow engine out of the sea? Maybe I did. Where did he go, Cranky? Thomas' questions were making Cranky cross. All I can remember was that his light was broken. And I couldn't understand a word he said! So, what-- ( Diesel's Horn Blasts ) Cinders and ashes! What are you doing here, Diesel? I'm looking for Sir Topham Hatt. Where is he, Cranky? I'm busy; how should I know? What is this, ask Cranky day? Suddenly, an idea flew into Thomas' funnel. Of course! Thank you, Cranky! ( Toot-Toot! ) I'm sorry, Thomas, I didn't mean to. ( Thomas Toots ) But Thomas was already thundering down the tracks. Slow down, Thomas! Where are you huffing so fast? The Steamworks! Why, Thomas? Where else would you take a rusty engine? ( Toot-Toot-Toot! ) ( Toooot! ) Hello, Thomas, I-- ( Toooot! ) Ahh! ( Metal Clattering ) Kevin! Kevin: Sorry, Boss! ( Toot-Toot! ) Victor, do you remember fixing a yellow engine that fell into the sea? He spoke a different language. ¡Calderas hirvientes! What did you say? Thomas saw Victor's wide eyes. Huh! Cinders and ashes! It was you, Victor! You were the engine that fell into the sea! ( Quietly ) You are right, Thomas. It was me. Please tell me what happened! ( Bang ) Kevin: Sorry, Boss! ( Sigh ) I have never spoken about this, Thomas. It was a long time ago. Far away, in my country, I was told they needed me to work on Sodor. They said I could be really useful. The ship was big. We sailed many seas, over many days. Before we reached Sodor, we made a stop and a small green engine joined me on the deck. Hola. ¿Adónde vas? ¿Vas a Sodor? We didn't speak the same language, but I could see that he was excited. ( Ship's Horn Blasting ) As we sailed into Sodor, a storm gathered. The skies darkened. The waves rolled. And with one big wave, the chains holding my wheels broke! I was no longer held to the deck. I was in danger! The weather's closing in! C'mon! Keep going! Luke: Take me off first! Please! Please! ¡Tengo un problema! I called to the crew. But they didn't understand me, so they did nothing to help me. A crane lifted the excited green engine first. He swayed on the end of the hook ( Crash ) and bumped into me! I could do nothing! There were no chains to stop me. Splash! I slid into the sea! Luckily, I landed on a jetty, but my firebox was soaked. And because the weather was so bad, I was left there, in the sea, for a long, long time. When I was finally lifted out, I was in a terrible mess. You must have been very frightened! Yes. It was scary. But the scariest thing of all was that no one understood me! So what did you do? I learned your language. My first word was "red"! Why "red"? Because, my friend, after they brought me to the Steamworks and repaired me, I had to be repainted. And red was the color I chose. A bright, new color for my bright, new life on Sodor! ( Laughing ) ( Gasps ) Of course! When Luke bumped into you, you rolled into the sea because you weren't chained! It was an accident! And you weren't sent to the smelter's yard! You were repaired! I must tell Luke right away! Thank you, Victor! Thank you for telling me! Thomas, who is Luke? Was he the little green engine? Thomas! Kevin: Bye, Thomas! ( Tooooot! ) Whoa! (♪ Fast-Paced Music ♪) Now I know the whole story! Now I know what really happened! Luke won't have to hide anymore! ( Gasps ) Cinders and ashes! Thomas saw Diesel! Diesel was talking to Sir Topham Hatt. Paxton told me all about him, sir. He's hiding somewhere at the quarry. He pushes engines into the sea! He's a danger to us all! He has to go! Enough, Diesel! I don't know what you are talking about. What I do know, is that Mavis needs fixing and no one is helping her. Please shunt her to the Dieselworks for repair... immediately! But, sir-- Now, Diesel! ( Diesel's Horn Blares ) Thank you, Diesel. You're very kind! ( Giggles ) That was lucky! ( Horn Blares ) And, Paxton, I don't know why you are following Diesel about... You should be working at the quarry. Of course, sir. I'm--I'm sorry, sir... Uh, sorry. Umm... And I should be working on my branchline, but I have to see Luke first. ( Engine Sputters ) Forward, Winston! Not that way! Ohhhh! Never mind, sir. It's still early days. Yes, Winston. Early days. Whoaaaaa! Oh my! ( Chug-Chug-Chug-Chug... ) Thomas' wheels whirred up the tracks. He had to get to the Blue Mountain Quarry before Diesel. He had to tell Luke what really happened to the yellow engine! Hello again, Thomas. Sorry, James! Can't stop! Bye! ( Toot-Toot-Toot! ) James was surprised. For a tank engine, he really can be quite fast. Thomas hurried into the Blue Mountain Quarry. But, Skarloey, I've been bumped again! Now, I have to be repainted. But you have to stop bumping into things, Rheneas! ( Toot-Toot-Toot! ) Skarloey: Hello, Thomas! Where's Luke? ( Steam Whistle Blasts ) Hello, Thomas! Luke, I have wonderful news for you! I talked to Victor! He told me what happened when you were being unloaded from the ship. He said-- What did you do? I--I talked to Victor. You talked to Victor?! Yes, but-- We told you not to talk to the other engines! And you have. We thought you were our friend. I thought you were my friend. Together: But you're not! Please! Wait! It's not what you think! Suddenly, Diesel's horn echoed around the Blue Mountain Quarry. Is that him? Are you the engine that pushes other engines into the sea? I've heard all about you. The narrow gauge engines rattled away from Thomas, Diesel and Paxton on the upper terraces of the quarry. Don't listen to Diesel. Let me explain! No, Thomas. Don't explain anything. We can see what you've done. Sir Handel: Go away, Thomas! Peter Sam: Go back to your branchline! Luke, don't chuff away from me. Please listen! I don't want to listen to you ever again! Thomas knew that his narrow gauge friends thought he had let them down. They thought Thomas had let Luke down. That was worst of all. Thomas felt terrible. Now, Sir Topham Hatt and Mr. Percival will sort your little friend out once and for all! ( Sinister Laugh ) Going down! Next stop: bottom of the hill. ( Tooot! Toot-Toot! ) Luke! ( Toot-Toot-Toot! ) Thomas, what are you doing? ( Toot-Toot-Toot-Toot! ) Rocky, please! Lift me onto Owen's platform. I have to talk to Luke. Well, I don't know, Thomas... Please, Rocky! Okay, if you say so. But hold tight, Thomas! ( Gasps ) Thomas! What are you doing, Thomas? You're too heavy for my platform! I need you to pull me up, Owen. I need to talk to Luke! I know you can do it. You're strong! Try your hardest! Okay, Thomas! Going up! Next stop: the top of the hill! Tug by tug... And turn by turn... Owen started to pull Thomas up the incline towards Luke. Come down, Luke! Thomas can't help you. We know what you've done. And what you did was bad. You'll have to leave Sodor. Sir Topham Hatt will make sure of that. Don't listen to him, Luke. I know what really happened. You didn't do anything wrong! Nonsense, Thomas. Paxton, go and find Sir Topham Hatt! Tell him to come here. Oh my! No, Paxton. Luke needs your help. Race to the Steamworks and tell Victor to come! Oh my! Oh my! Go! Too bad, Thomas. You can't help your little friend now! Yes, I can, Diesel! Owen, you did it! Well done! ( Breathless ) Top floor! Upper terrace. Boulder Drop and Blondin Bridge. Luke! Luke! ( Toot-Toot-Toot! ) Thomas tried to race off to find Luke, but then there was trouble! His wheels were too big for the narrow gauge tracks! Oh dear! Oh! Ohhh! Whoa! Whoaaaa-Ohhh! ( Crash! ) Oh, oh-Ohhhh! Oh, ohh! Whoa! ( Toot-Toot-Toot! ) Ohhhh! ( Toot-Toot-Toot-Toot! ) Thomas was in danger! Whoa! Help! Help! ( Toot-Toot-Toot-Toot! ) Help! ( Toot-Toot-Toot!) Whoa! ( Steam Whistle Blares ) Diesel: Watch out, Thomas! He's going to push you off now, just like he did with that yellow engine. Oh no! Everyone waited. Everyone watched Luke. ( Shouting ) Thomas! ( Metal Clanking ) Thomas, don't worry! I'll pull you back to Owen. What? Trust me, I can do this. I'm your friend. ( Metal Clanking & Scraping ) Whoaa! Oh, trembling tracks! Ohh! Hold on, Thomas! ( Wheels Screeching ) Oh, oh, oh... ( Laughing ) Thank you, Luke! Luke felt strong, stronger than he had ever been. The engines whistled and cheered. Well done, Luke! Hooray! ( Whistle Blares ) Even Merrick woke up! Very well done... to all of you! Thank you, Luke! It's all right, Thomas-- Whooaaa!! Cinders and ashes! Owen was surprised. Steady! Next stop-- You're too heavy! Together: Whoooooaaaaa!! Other Engines: Oh no! Watch out! Together: Whoooooaaaaa!! ( Crash! ) Fizzling fireboxes! ( Cheering & Whistling ) Superb! Marvelous! ( Whistles & Laughs ) Hmph! ( Honk-Honk! ) Suddenly, all the engines heard the strangest sound! ( Engine Sputters ) ( Honk-Honk-Honk! ) Sir Topham Hatt was cross. What is going on? Thomas, whatever are you doing? I'm sorry, sir. I, uh... I told you to work on your branchline, but you're not! Toby is! I'm sorry, sir, I-- Rocky! Bring those engines down from the unloading platform! Yes, sir. Right away, sir. I can explain, sir. That engine there is called Luke. He's a bad engine. He knocked the yellow engine into the sea. Thomas has been hiding him here. Sir Topham Hatt stared, first at Luke, and then at Thomas. It's not like that, sir! ( Train Whistle Blasts ) Paxton! ( Train Whistle Blasts ) You've brought Victor! Victor?! What are you doing here? Sir, I have come to meet an engine I have not seen for a very long time. His name is Luke. Victor, this is Luke. Hello, Luke, my friend. It's been a very long time. You didn't push me, Luke. I slipped off the boat. My wheel chains were broken. It was an accident. It wasn't your fault. But... it can't be you! You're not a yellow engine, and you don't speak a different language. ( Laughs ) Buenos días, Luke. Me llamo Victor. ¡Es un placer volverte a ver! ( Gasps ) That's the language! That's right, my friend. But the engine on the boat with me was yellow. That's very true. I was yellow, but I was painted red when Sir Topham Hatt had me repaired. You didn't go to the smelter's yard? No! I stayed at the Steamworks. That's where I work. Come down to visit me. You can get a coat of paint, a polish, a brush... You will be a new engine! ( Laughs ) And for the first time, in a long, long time, Luke was happy. Rheneas: Speaking of paint, Victor. I've been talking to Skarloey about being repainted-- ( Coughs ) Not now, Rheneas. Luke, I am very happy to meet you at last. Welcome to my railway! It seems, Diesel, you were wrong. You did not find out the whole story before you caused confusion and delay. It is always important to find out what really happened, because what really happened is what really matters. Yes, sir. Today is a very happy day for Mr. Percival and all his engines. Thomas has made it a happy day, sir. He's my hero. He's my friend. ( Toot-Toot! ) Well done, Thomas. I am proud of you. Thank you, sir. And that is why I will forgive you for not working on your branchline. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Mr. Percival, we must be very proud of all our engines. Indeed... very proud indeed. New ones and old ones, you are all... Together: Really useful engines. ( Laughter ) ( Train Whistles Blowing ) And no engines whistled louder than Thomas and Luke!
