It's been a long time since I've seen my old buddy, Mike. Bet he ain't changed a bit. Mikey, Mikey, Mike! - [Nurse] Sorry we're closed. - Nurse McComb? - Yes? - Damn, you look good. Can't believe you're still around. I forgot that things change when you're gone, but you're the same as when I left. - Do I know you, young man? - Well, it's kinda hard to explain. I've been in outer space for quite awhile. - I recognize you now. - Why haven't you aged, Nurse McComb? - I'm very busy, you'll have to come back. - I have, where's Mike? - [Nurse] He's not here! I, I don't know! He must have checked out! - Where are the other nurses at? What've you done with Mike? - I sent them outside, you're hurting me! - [Blackie] What've you done with Mike? - They're not here! I sent them to pick flowers. - Flowers for who? If you're so young, it's Mikey's blood that's making it that way! What's he doing with you and the other nurses, huh? - I told you he's not! (hand thuds) - Your sick experiment is over. (Nurse screams) - You realize Michael's different now. - I'm the reason Mike is different! Or do you forget the night that I was brought in? - You know Michael hasn't aged in 42 years. He might not remember you, and if he does, he might not like you anymore! - Lies, lies, I'm tired of these lies! (punk rock music) Mike, yeah, sorry I took off like that. - Mikey, tell this hoodlum to stop! - Or you'll what? Call the old hags? (bottle crashes) You never brought me one stinking comic book, you bitch! - Mikey, you can have it all. Just don't let me grow old. - I'll have it all the moment you die. The time is now. (punk rock music) - I gave you everything for 42 years, but I was waiting for it all to end. After all, everything you touch rots and turns to shit. - [Narrator] Mike was always fond of mayhem. Mike always had a fascination with kicking, and hitting, and stomping. His biggest kick was being drafted, going off to kill the enemy in the Korean War. The only problem was, when the enemy was dead, Mike turned the gun on his own troop. - Victim number 11, and we've got to bury her in the Chosen Spot. - [Narrator] Certifiably insane, he was sent to Cedar Hill to live out his life in a strait jacket but the story never ends. When Mike arrived, he needed eight pints of blood. Blackie, the newest inmate at the time, was the only available donor. Soon after, Blackie disappeared off the face of the earth. Mike's comic collection began to rot, but Mike never grew any older. (punk rock music) - [Blackie] Read any good comic books lately? - [Mike] Not in about 42 years. I thought you were never coming back. - [Blackie] The Elders, they don't know I've escaped. At least I don't think they do. I want you to help me finish the kill. - [Mike] A lot of shit can go down in 42 years, man. - [Black] I'm picking up on what you're saying. - [Mike] I was kinda thinking about seeing the old homestead. I bet it's on some kind of national register. See the home of Beautiful Boy Floyd. - [Blackie] Sea monkeys? - Everything's shot to hell, man, except for them. They're still here right here where I left them. - You found your parents? - No, man, better than that. I found my comics. Oh, that Johnson Smith package finally came. - I really shouldn't have opened these, but I did. Hey, you mind if I tear up some firewood? (mysterious music) - [Mike] Law enforcement officers dying as a result of a criminal's activities should be discouraged. Females shall be drawn realistically without exaggeration of any physical qualities. - [Blackie] Hey, damn it! There's some fool driving in the middle of the damn road! - [Mike] Hey, watch out man! (tires screeching) (guns firing) - I'm not in it to win or be famous. - Then why do you do it? - Kicks, strictly for laughs. (punk rock music) I played in these woods when I was a girl. My folks live over yonder. - Did you hear what happened here in 1954? - UFO murders, oh yeah. Man, it bugged me. I wanted to find out why? - Yeah, that was some of my work. I was laying low out here when the fuzz was looking for me. I lost a lot of blood in these woods. - So, you killed the nine that lived on the gravel road? - I killed them. Buried them right here. Nobody's found them yet. Seems like nobody cares to look. - I killed someone today, right before I met you. - What, on your way home from prison? - Yeah, I was about a mile away from the prison and flying like a bat out of hell. The only thing I wanted to think about was the upkeep on my machine. Then I saw him. There's always that long drive home after a prison stay, and what's the first sign of humanity I see? - [Blackie] What's a hippie? - Man, you have been far, far away. - What is it like a beatnik or something? - Imagine someone who doesn't believe in war, or the death penalty, or taking a bath, and there he stood thumbing a ride. As I passed, I thought who'd be dumb enough to pick him up? Hitchhikers are responsible for the decline of western civilization, and hippie hitchers are the worst, but then I realized, hey, if I fuck around with this guy is John Q Public ever gonna care? - Thank you kindly, sister. For this is an act of love that you do. - [Kerine] After all, I just got out of prison. - I mean, love is the only thing that matters. I mean, look, I mean, if those corrupt, capitalist pigs would just see love instead of material wealth, I mean, there would be peace and groovy faces everywhere. - Aw, shut up! I'm not charging you for the lift. - Look, I may not have any money, you know, or material possessions, but I'm rich because I give my love to everyone. - Wow, wouldn't it be nice if we could all be like you? - Well, I'm pleased that you'd like to be like me, you know, a man with no worldly possessions, and I think I'd like to help you out in your goal. - Really? - By relieving you of your car, get out. (tires screeching) - You fucker! (punk rock music) (Kerine whistles) (head thuds) (punk rock music) The car is powered by a stock bore and stroke, 48 Mercury engine equipped with an Edelbrock. Eight and a half to one heads, and an Offenhauser triple manifold with three Stromberg 97 carburetors. Ass, gas, or grass. No one rides for free! (punk rock music) - Wait, I mean, don't, don't do this, sister. I feel like we were lovers, you know, in another world. I mean, can't you feel it? I mean, let's smoke some grass and start a revolution! - If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a hippie. (gun firing) - Bummer (grunts). - And that's how I got my gun. - Maybe I could kill a hippie. Tomorrow I gotta kill somebody. - How many more you like? - One. - Can I kill the last one for ya? - [Blackie] If that's okay with Mikey. - Will it count as one of the 12? - Yeah, I don't see why not? Your blood is mixed with mine. - What if I kill more than one, like two? - No, baby, that would just give me a headache. I'm in enough hot water as it is already. If we don't kill by the rules, we'll be stuck here forever. - I certainly wouldn't want to break any rules. but when I kill, I kind of lose count. (mysterious music) (Kerine laughing maniacally) (mysterious music) (pointer thuds) - [Agent] In Mississippi? - Unlikely spot. - Not really, if you know the history of the Chickasaw. - Well, we've all heard the end is coming. So, what are we up against? - Well, according to Larry, these beings are ultra-conservative in nature, and uh, they base their look on American culture of the late 50s. They mistrust anything they perceive as being foreign, although they're foreign themselves. - And there's nothing we can do about that? - Oppose them, with another archetype. - [Fed] Our collective subconscious energy? - [Officer] And the Men in Black will come. - [Fed] These Men in Black with their Asian features. - Greasers see them as a threat, natural opponents. - Let's bring them here as our guests, and talk about this problem that only we can see. - I don't think we have that much time. - Let's bring them here to kill our own. - Hey, what was your vacation like? - A world without men. - Now, don't feel like a stranger. Everything is just like you left it. Oh, now don't pay no attention to your Ma. (metal thuds) She don't talk. She got quiet since you went to prison. Uh, Kerine, uh come on in here, girl. We got it fixed up real nice for ya. - Take me to the woodshed. - No, we got a new room for ya. Hey, Ma, can't we go to show Tinkerbell her present. The social worker said you asked for these quite awhile back, but damned if I can remember. - I needed that 21 years ago. - Well, it's a 1975 set, hon. (mysterious music) - [Kerine] Let's see what it says about prison. - Go on, go to your room then. Nothings changed out there either. - [Blackie] What the hell's taking Kerine so long? - I don't know, Blackie. You getting bored? - Hey, Tinkerbell. If you need me, I'll be working on the old car. (mysterious music) - [Narrator] Kerine loved to bang. She banged on things, but since Kerine was reared way out in the sticks, her parents never showed her a love for artistic expression. There was no way for Kerine to vent transgressions. Kerine's mother hated her guts, so Kerine made lots of trips to the woodshed. Until one day, turned on by the idea that she could bang on skin that was still alive, Kerine decided to bang on her parents, bash their skulls in, that is. So, Kerine got sent to the big bird cage, where they like to fricassee. Now, she's off with five years of good behavior. The first time she failed. Now Kerine has a new skin, and she won't make the same mistakes again. (Mike clucking) (fists thudding) (gun firing) - I'm gonna kill your ass now, motherfucker. (gun firing) Kerine, Kerine, Kerine! Oh, Kerine. There was nine when I started. I choked the redneck. Mike stomped the nurse. Now, Kerine's plugged the old lady. That's 12, that's 12. - Hey man. - This is the 12th victim. We can go home now. - Kerine's outside, you better check with her first. - Aw, shit! (head thuds) - [Ghostly Voices] 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13! You killed 13! You know that's too many! Bring her back, goddamn it! Bring the old fucker back! (fist thuds) - My father was victim 12, so my mother was the last to die (laughs loudly). - I checked for a pulse. I think I'm gonna go haul off the old man. - You screwed up big time! (mysterious music) - Ah Blackie, you've wasted your time since you escaped, and this gang you run with, they influence the kill, and need I remind you, you haven't killed the young. You've killed your elders. And this woman, oh, she's got power over you. For that alone, you should remain on Earth forever. - [Blackie] What are you talking about? - Shut up kid. I know what you are trying to do. Listen, here's your chance to make everything A-okay. You must take back the death of the mother by sacrificing a new victim, one of my choosing, number 14. The mother will come back and a window of time will open. - Huh? - Now this is what you have to do if you want to return. - Who's this chosen victim? - I got news for you. It won't be anyone old. (mysterious music) - You got to help me, I'm trying. (mysterious music) (cane thuds) - Whatever man, I know it seems bad. - There's a way out of this, Mikey. Kerine, look at me. Kerine, look at me. We're stuck here till we work this shit out with the Elders. We're going to bury your father in the 12th grave, and your momma's gonna ride in the back of the Pacer. - Why? - I've got to kill another victim. Only me, understand? - I couldn't stand it if she were to live again. I don't know what I'd do. I'd go crazy! - Me, you, and Mikey are linked together by blood. We have to live by our actions. If you wanted to kill somebody, you should have checked with me first! (punk rock music) - [Kerine] You should have told me you, motherfucker. How was I to know what your fucked plans were? - [Blackie] I did tell you last night, bitch. (gun firing) (fist thuds) - I'm tough, you bastard. We'll see who loves and who wins. (Kerine laughs loudly) Kill, kill, kill! (punk rock music) - Look at that. She put that pin over her heart right where I first nailed her. - [Mike] So, do we know who this chosen victim is? - They'll let me know, but I hope it happens soon. I don't like this anymore than y'all do. - Hey man, let me waffle-stomp this next one. - Nobody do anymore killing. I'm the one who's to kill. Just a little while longer and we can all go home. I'm sure of it. (siren wailing) They don't wanna stop us. (siren wailing) (punk rock music) Looks like rain's closing down the fair, but we lost that cop.

The nurses put my stuff on the road and there sat my bike, which is everything I own, so I just took off. - I could see why the nurse wouldn't want you there. - Well, it's weird, but Mike? - Yeah? - You were the only guy I really remembered. - Well I was the only guy there. I forgot, I gotta go meet my friends. Do you wanna come with me? - Wait. - Hey baby, easy on the threads. I dig you too. - But, you got any money? - I prefer the unreal things.

One dollar, that's all it takes, one dollar! - D'Lana, you're letting her get away. - Aw, cool down.

Former asylum inmate D'Lana Tunnell has been charged with four counts of murder and one hippie death. These recent slayings in Northeast, Mississippi, in the Jericho community, coincide with the discovery of nine graves behind the Lee County Drive-In. Graves containing those victims whom the police believe were killed 42 years ago. - [Elder] D'Lana must die by your hands, if you are to return home. - Woo, I'm hungry. I know right where I'm going when we get to Memphis. - What about my mother? She's beginning to stink! - Medium rare, Western Steak Lounge. - I know you don't wanna think about this, but you're not gonna get another chance at D'Lana's throat.

Not, not this bar, but well, anyway, this guy walks in with a damn duck on his head. The bartender says, hey pal, you've got a duck on your head. - [Man] Yeah, we heard! - And uh, anyway, the patron says, yeah, that may have something to do with the fact that I've just fucked your mother. (audience jeers) You're not really into family oriented humor, I see. Well, anyway, I haven't always lived the glamorous lifestyle of the night club comedienne. I was a pizza delivery driver for this vegetarian place called Peace of Pie. I delivered exclusively to hippies, and I tell you I did learn one thing on the job, and that's the difference-- - [Man] That's funny, hey. - There was a difference between a hippie and an onion. - [Man] What's that? - Well, you don't cry so much when you cut the hippie.

Sent down here to Memphis to kill 12 hippies, just like I just told you. - Well, it looks like you missed a couple. 12, who told you to kill 12? - The Rulers of the Lo Frequency, man, the Elders, whatever. You thought I was shitting you, didn't you? Well, let me tell you something, man. They're all around us. They're sent down here to live cheap, but they don't stay here long. - You said you killed 12. - No, no, no, no, I killed too many, and that's why I'm trapped here forever. - Hey, Kerine, uh could you get us some more beer, please? - Yeah, I think I've heard all this bullshit before anyway. Tuthpick, we're in the same motherfucking boat. I first came to this planet in 1954 to kill beatniks, and they were like us at first, cool, unsteady, then they changed. The Elders claimed that civilization started going to the dogs. When the beatnik thing caught on, they sent me to take care of 12. - That's not enough. - Now I was sent out to Mississippi. Believe me, beatniks are hard to find in Mississippi in 1954. So, my time ran out, and I went back to our world a loser. - Yeah, and they all became hippies after you left, and the decline of western civilization continued. - I come back to finish the kill. Of course, can't find anything now, but a bunch of old farts. Course, me and my blood bunch started having a little too much fun, fucked around, killed too many, now we're stuck here just like you. - Well, you're a winner in one department though, man. That redhead, woo! - Yeah, they warned me about women too. Everything is a test of manhood with the Elders. - Yeah, and they make up their own rules as they go along. - If I could kill this one extra chick, then my fuck up would be forgotten. I'd be on my way home now. Course, I fucked up again. - You didn't get to snuff her? - Tuthpick, circumstances prevented it! Now this chick is locked away where I'll never be able to get my hands on her. - Why did the Elders pick her? - That's what I don't understand. She ain't a hippie. - Sounds like a trick, man. They tricked me too, you know. - The Elders went against their word. - They told me exactly what they told you. Kill another, then another, and then you find out they're never gonna let you go back anyway. You're just a machine for the old man's politics. Let me tell you a little story, man. It was 1978, of course to me, it was like it was yesterday. You know what I mean? And I'd been in Memphis for about one week. All I had to do was kill one more hippie, Chuck Moonchow. Dissatisfaction with society. Mistreated by the culture that gave them food. Living in school. Can't get them up unless the government props them up. What's their problem, huh? Whatever happened to their good old fashion will power, I ask you? Anyways, I had my last hippie kill to get through. I was instructed by my connection where to find him.

Let her blood be on the hands of others, then the window might open for both of us to get back. - Well wait, they told Blackie only he could kill D'Lana. - Then believe the opposite of what you were told.

I could never tell. - [Mikey] I was immortal. - What was it that did you in, Michael? Was it losing your blood brother? Was it falling love? Or was it the Men in Black? - [Mikey] Cut that blood brother shit. Blood lost it's power, started to change. - Blood may give out, Michael, but hate never will. That's what keeps me young. - [Mikey] I use to think I owed Blackie, because he made me immortal. Now I realize that's why I hate him. I never wanted to hate anybody, except you, that is. - It's not easy being evil, Michael! Voices from other worlds telling you what to do! (punk rock music) (moves into mysterious music) - Hello, Satan (chuckles). - Hello God. - Destroying youth has brought you to us. Even though you look like a woman, you have qualities we may need. - Fuck you! - We had hoped that Blackie would kill D'Lana, thereby sealing his fate. Somehow or other, the truth was revealed to him. - I'll do anything you say! Just don't bring my mother back. - Then you kill D'Lana. After all, you and Blackie are of the same blood. It would be as if he had done it himself. If you can find a way, and I promise you one thing, if you do, your mother will never haunt you again. - If you're lying, I'll find a way back here, and I'll kill you. (Elder laughing) (mysterious music) (Kerine screams) - Quit fucking around, will ya? Tuthpick's letting us stay here till the window opens. In fact, I gotta go meet Tuthpick right now. - You're going to leave me here? Where the hell are you going? - To Crosstown! - Profanity, obscenity, smut, vulgarity, or words, or symbols which have required undesirable meaning are forbidden, forbidden. - You know what, dude? I'm going to let the manager take a look at these, okay? So, why don't you browse for a bit? (light rock music) - Watch what you say about Steppenwolf. They'll kill your ass. - Man, I can't see a hippie being all that violent. (light rock music) - [Tuthpick] You gotta keep the motherfuckers doped up, man. Or else the smart ones will organize a revolt. - [Blackie] So, the government let's them do just about-- - [Tuthpick] Hell, they are the government! They're coming for your uncool niece. (eerie whispers) (mysterious music) (horn blowing) - Hey, they're waiting for the stuff. Get out there and get the money! Go on, get the money this time! Go on, get on out there! - Schlitz! - Goddamn, these people. Hey, hey, I got a week's paycheck in there, back off! I should've known it was you boys! Just get your ass back to outer space! (Men In Black growling) (gun firing) (Bootlegger screaming) (mysterious music) - [Leader] Beer! - [Men In Black] Beer! (mysterious music) - [Mike] If society is to survive, the artist must be kept on the bottom rung. Of course, you know I love's you, baby. (door thuds) (mysterious music) (television static) (mysterious music) (child giggling) - [D'Lana] M-I-K-E-M-A-K-E-R (mysterious music) (television static) (mysterious music) - [Radio Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, I've just been handed this by a prison official who wishes to remain anonymous. D'Lana Tunnell is to be electrocuted at midnight by the state of Tennessee. Politicians had hoped to keep this a secret to avoid protests from the growing good girl cult that has championed D'Lana's body if not her intent. D'Lana's last request was the final issue of a particular comic book banned by the government 42 years ago. ♪ Tell me why should it be ♪ ♪ You in that room, in that room ♪ - Where you going? - I know D'Lana dies at midnight. I'll have the car back before then, so we can return to this fucking world of yours! (mysterious music) - So, that's all I have for notes from last month. Does anybody have any sightings to report? Uh, Leo? - [Leo] The art is on the side. - I'm sorry I'm late. - Do you have a sighting to report? - Well, not exactly. I just knew that you people would be the only ones who would believe me. It occurred to me that I was different. That I was born under a sign, and that's why these things happened to me. It's always been hard for me to remember, until now. Well, I was going to be married I think, but then I was abducted by this old timers cult from outer space who came to Earth to kill the young, but things got all mixed up. The cult stayed young, but the gods, the gods got older. Anyway, I was taken by the Men In Black, and then arrested by the FBI, and an angel kissed me with her blood, and then I saw the end of the world. - And when might that be? - Tomorrow. - [All] Tomorrow? - Tombs of the dead blasted open. Children smothered in their own blood. Just like it says in Revelations. I feel sorry for the people that have to live through tomorrow. That's why I've come to kill you. (man laughing) - Into the depths of the sea, and a tempest hath overwhelmed me. Save me, O God. For the waters are coming, even unto my soul. I stick fast in the mire of the deep, and there is no sure standing. I have labored. (door thuds) (siren wailing) (gun firing) Let them not ashamed of me. To look for the, uh. (guns firing) To prepare my strength, O God. A formidable God, for thou, for thou hast salvation. God is the-- (gun firing) (priest screams) - Say hello to my mother. (punk rock music) - [Radio Announcer] We interrupt this musical program to bring you an urgent bulletin from the City Penitentiary. Someone has broken through security and killed several of the prison guards. Many shots were fired, but the killer, a woman, seems impervious to bullets. - Hey, hey, my old lady just flew the coop. It's me and you, dude. - Hey man, I'm sorry about that, man. You can't have my car though. - Aw, we ain't got time to be fucking around, T.P. - The name is Tuthpick, and I mean it, you can't have my car! - I thought we had an agreement. - Man, listen to the radio! Something's up! Time ain't right! - Listen, Kerine is still a loser. She may get to D'Lana, but she ain't getting to me. - You'll never make it! Not in my car! If Kerine gets to that D'Lana chick, it'll be like you snuffing her. The window's never going to open! (punk rock music) ♪ I'll take the whole good day ♪ ♪ To be in my apartment at home ♪ (car engine roaring) ♪ At home, where I get those thrills ♪ ♪ I got time to kill, but I love ya ♪ - Good Luck! (punk rock music) (telephone ringing) - [Man] Hello, stay the electrocution of D'Lana Tunnell! The Governor has said she is innocent of all crimes! This is on the governors orders! Hello, please, please, pick up the phone! Stay the electrocution of D'Lana Tunnell! Please, will somebody pick up the phone? Stay the electrocution! Please, pick up the phone, please! (telephone beeping) - [Narrator] D'Lana Tunnell is, was a messenger from the Amazon Planet deep within the Pleiadian Constellation. She was sent to Earth to warn us of the coming fifth comet. But when she was little, D'Lana smacked her skull on the pavement. Her psychic powers irrevocably damaged, D'Lana began to ride motorcycles and listen to race music. D'Lana was left with a notion, like so many other harbingers, that she was to do something very, very important. If she could only remember what it was. ♪ Time was in a vacuum ♪ ♪ When I wanted to be free, yeah, yeah ♪ (flies buzzing) (mysterious music) (fist thudding) (speaking in foreign language) (mysterious music) - Sidney. (mysterious music) (zombie screaming) (mysterious music) (thunderous explosion) - Why? - [Elder] Because (laughing). You're a loser (laughing).
