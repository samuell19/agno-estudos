Well done, Jerry Mouse. Thanks for the rope. I'll take it from here. Ha-ha! Don't move a muscle, friend. Here now, I'd say that was a job well done. Now, let's see. What have we here? Ah, gold. All this... ...taxed from the poor so that the rich can get richer. It simply will not do. Oh, yes, it will. The famous Robin Hood caught in my little trap. How pathetic. Not as pathetic as you, Sheriff of Nothingham. It's Nottingham. And you are my prisoner. - Oh. - Aah! Is that a fact? Aah! Aah! Ooh! Aah! OW! You there, driver. Seize him. Yes, you. Grab Robin Hood. I'm afraid he won't be doing that. He's actually one of my men, Little John. Huh? - He hijacked your wagon about, what...? - Ooh, five miles back. It's still 10 to 2. Two and one-sixteenth. I'd say more like 10 to 50. No. Good grief. Thanks to a wee bird, or, rather, a tiny mouse... ...I knew you were planning a little trap for me so I planned a little trap for you. So nice of you to use real gold as bait, my lord. - Tie them up. - Huh? Not you, Jerry. Let the men do that. You and Little John can help me roll these barrels of gold back home. Perfect job for your tiny little feet. This one's for you, little buddy. Thanks again, sheriff. Oh! I hate you, Robin Hood. Oh, it's a rough life just trying to get by The tax man comes and bleeds you dry No matter how much you give It's never enough If you say you've nothing left He'll say That's tough It's a rough life just trying to get by The tax man comes and Aah! He bleeds you dry That's why we fight We fight for Robin Hood Robin stands for right He fights for all that's good That is why they stand To join my merry band We are merry men and that is grand The good king's left on a long Crusade While he's gone He has been betrayed His brother John is a greedy soul - He'll tax your soup - And he'll tax your bowl But fear not, good folk Listen and behold Robin Hood will thwart him With action brave and bold That's why we fight We fight for Robin Hood Robin stands for right He fights for all that's good He takes from the rich And to the poor he gives And with his merry men In Sherwood Forest lives Aah...! Whoo! Aah! Aah! Whoo! Aah! Whoo! Aah! Whoo! Aah! Whoo! My dear sheriff... ...perhaps you have forgotten one very important thing. I not only love money, love it, love it, love it... ...but I need it. I'm going to be King John one day... - ...not Prince John. - Yes, my lord. And a king needs to be rich. Mm! Rich. Heh-heh-heh. Stinking rich! Yes, my lord. And I can't be stinking rich... ...unless you stop Robin Hood from stealing all my taxes. What does he do with my money? Gives it to the poor? What's up with that? The poor don't need money. They're poor. Well, it's not my fault, sire. I think... How do I put this? Robin Hood is getting his information from inside the castle. A spy? Prince John, if you will excuse me, I'd like to retire. You know how matters of state are too much for my sweet little head. Yes, yes, off you go. Good night, Maid Marion. Good night. Sweet dreams. Close your mouth. You're as bad as the wolves. So we have a spy? Yes, I believe Robin Hood is smuggling information back and forth... ...via a very tiny courier. And I have just the man to stop him. - Him? - No. - Uh, him? - No. Silly sheriff, you're out of men. May I introduce my cat-at-arms, Thomas. You see, because Robin Hood is using a mouse as his messenger... ...Tom is perfect. Now off with you. Prepare for your mission. A cat to catch a mouse. Genius! Pure genius. I love money! Oh, the mouse is nothing, sire. What matters is with its capture, we'll find the traitor. Yes. Find the traitor. But if my brother, the good King Richard, returns from the Crusades... ...it will all be for nothing. I'll never be king. The nice part about Crusades is they're extremely dangerous. He may never return. How long before we cross the Channel for England? Good King Richard, another two days and the ship will be ready, uh, sire. But how I miss my kingdom and my people. The sooner we get home, the better. Eh, my good bear? Uh, oh, yeah. Uh, what you just said, sire. Two days. We gotta warn Prince John. Yeah, so's he can definitely make a nice reception for his big brother. Heh-heh. It'll be a killer. Shush! Come on. Let's go. We'll get ourselves a nice reward for this juicy bit of news. Heh-heh. Oh, boy. Now, my fine lads, who wants to help me hand out Prince John's money? Huzzah! Huzzah! Ha-ha! Grab your gear. Ha-ha. Not you, my little friend. - Youch! - Oh, don't fret now. I have an even more important job for you. Something that fits your size. I need you to make another delivery. It's a poem I've written for Maid Marion. Could you please take it to her? Now you mustn't let this fall into the wrong hands... ...for her sake more than mine. You see, son of mine, your pops has a very important job. This here log boat is vital to our whole operation. It's how we move around without nobody being the wiser. That's why I can't let nobody take the log boat. No way, no how. Hm. Uh-- - Yoo-hoo - H m? Big fella, I got something for you. What? Robin Hood! There! Oh, Thomas, I am simply all nerves this evening. Would you play me a song? Ooh! Oh, Thomas, that was ever so lovely. Please play another, won't you? Hm. No encore? Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh! Heh-heh. What have we here, Sir Mouse? A message? From? My love. Oh, Robin Hood. Oh, dear. Oh-ho. I can't quite make it out. It's a poem. My dearest Maid Marion I love you more than spring flowers And the summer breeze And... cheese Oh, my beloved Robin. He so loves his cheese. Here, take him this good luck charm as a token of my affection. It will keep him safe. And I'll stay here inside the castle... ...and keep him informed of anything that the sheriff and Prince John are up to. Thank you, little mouse for your brave service. Mm. Careful now. Ouch! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Oof! What if we had the peasants build a giant statue of me holding money? Your cat-at-arms is dampening the fire. Isn't he supposed to be after that mouse? Yes. So sorry, sire. Problem is, Robin Hood has stolen so much of the tax money... ...that I might not have enough for my statue. What are we going to do? Sire, what is the perfect bait for the perfect trap, hm? - Ah! - Besides money? Well, for you, a beautiful woman who shall remain nameless. Maid Marion. And, for someone like Robin Hood, to be crowned best archer in all of England. Perhaps we should offer him all three at an archery tournament. Oh, well, that is good. Hey, you, that's royal property Come back here. Well, well, a royal archery contest. The winner is given a purse of gold and crowned best archer in all of England. And he receives a kiss from Maid Marion. Oh, here we go. Gentlemen, I put it to you, as the best archer in all of England... ...I should be crowned as such and win this purse of gold for the poor. Huzzah! And, of course, the grandest prize of all... ...will be the moment where Maid Marion rests her ruby reds... ...resplendent with divine delights... ...against my own, bespeaking love... ...without one word uttered. I get to smooch with my girlfriend. - Huzzah! - Huzzah. That's Middle English for "hooray." You know it's probably a trap. You think that will stop Robin? They'll arrest you on sight, my boy. Worry not, my good friar. Lest you forget, I am a master of disguise. I have got a bad feeling about this. Keep it natural. Just blend in. Ah, what a beautiful day for a trap. Heh-heh. Oh, yes, it is. Heh. Sire, you don't actually believe Robin Hood would be foolish enough to show up today? Oh, yes. I think I know the mind of that scalawag a little better than you, my dear. I fear you're right. Now let the games begin. Here, Jerry. Give Maid Marion this. It's my lucky charm... ...for her to replace the one she gave me. No? How about this then? That is a very lucky spoon. It saved my life once. No? Then what? That is an excellent idea. Well done, Jerry Mouse. Anybody seen my helmet? Ow! We have our two finalists! - The Sheriff of Nottingham... - Psst. Psst. Psst. ...and John of Smithtown. You're so lovely. Psst. Pss-- Lovely. Heh-heh-heh. Hi. Heh-heh-heh. - Heh... - Whoever's arrow... ...comes closest to the bull's-eye... ...will win the competition. After you. Dead center! Huh? Oh. A miss. The sheriff wins. - Wait a minute. - Huh. We have a winner. - Huzzah! - Heh-heh. I've come to claim my prize. Especially the kiss. The only prize you'll be getting... ...is the sharp edge of the executioner's ax... ...Robin Hood. - Oh! Oh, no. This way, men. Oh, never mind. Well, now, men, it's, um... It's not as bad as it looks. - It looks like we're all imprisoned. - Being taken to the dungeon. To be executed on the morrow. When you say it like that, I guess it is as bad as it looks. Will, look. It's Jerry Mouse. Here he comes. And there he goes. Ha-ha! Good fellow. Jerry, the lock. Can you open it'? - Huh? - Oh... Well, third time's the charm. You've got it this time, Jerry. He's done it! Gallant try, dear mouse. Gallant try. Enjoy the slop, boys. Even though you'll be dead before it's digested. - Right? Ha-ha-ha. - Go on, have a laugh while you can. You must not know who you're dealing with. Isn't that right, Robin? Robin? Robin? He's always been there to help in time of need. Now who's gonna help Robin? I'm afraid you'd need an army to get in there, my dear. It'll take a different sort of hero to save Robin Hood. I'm sorry, men. Don't blame yourself, my son. It's because of me that we're in here. And it's because of me that she's... ...still up there instead of in my arms. Oh, my darling Marion. Oh, my dear, sweet Robin. Gazing from my window There you are You're so very close and yet so far When I see your face, dear Then I know this much is true There's no other one for me but you No other love for me No other one for me No other love for me I know deep in my heart No other one for me No other love for me, it's true There's no other one for me but you Chained within this cell I dream of you Thoughts of all the scrapes That we've been through Giving me the courage For the fight that's sure to be There's no other hope for me, you see No other love for me No other one for me No other love for me I know - Deep in my heart - Deep in my heart - No other one for me - No other one for me - No other love for me, it's true - No other love for me, it's true - Nothing's ever keeping us - Nothing's ever keeping us - Apart - Apart Oh, Jerry, this is terrible. Perhaps I should write Robin a note. There must be something we can do. Maid Marion. As the default winner of the archery contest... ...I believe I'm owed that kiss. What do you have there? Nothing, my lord. A letter? To Robin Hood? You're the SPY? That's right, you blackguard. Well, now you'll perish as a traitor. Unless... Hm... You know, I could spare you from that fate... ...if you agree to be my wife. I wouldn't marry you if you were the last man on Earth... ...Sheriff of Nothingham. It's-- It's Nottingham. The Sheriff of Nottingham! Get it? Nottingham. Regardless, I would rather be finished off by the executioner's ax... ...than become your wife. That, fair maid, can and will be arranged. Guards! Let no one in or out. If she tries to escape, finish her. Are you sure? She's the only girl in this whole picture. Sire, we need to talk. In a moment. My spies have just arrived from France. What news have you of my brother? Oh, it's terrible news, my liege. Very bad, definitely very bad. Yes, yes, not now, you stupid cat. - The king, Richard the Lionheart, returns. - Definitely coming back. Even as we speak, he's on a ship that lands in England tomorrow morn. Yeah, crack of dawn, definitely very early. The Crusades are over? Well, that was fast. Sire, if the king returns, we'll-- I mean, you will lose all your power. And more importantly, I'll have to move back into the guest castle... ...without any of my money. Sire, perhaps my men and I could meet the king at the shore... ...and make sure he never returns. Oh. Heh. I would like to see that. I only have one request. When you have Robin Hood executed, add Maid Marion to that list. - She was our spy. - Really? Any who betray the throne must be dealt with harshly. I mean, my throne, not my brother's, who we're going to kill, right? Why, that's the signal from Jerry. It's go time, boys. Now, son of mine, things might get scary in there. You stick close to your old pops. And if you need to defend yourself, use this. Hm. That works too. Open sesame. Ha-ha! Ride hard, men. We must get there before the king's ship makes land. Won't my brother be surprised... ...when he doesn't make it back to England alive after all. I can't wait to see the look on his cold, lifeless face. Close sesame. The castle sure seems empty. Yeah. Where were the sheriff and Prince John riding off to so fast? Something's going on. We'll find out. - I'm here to minister to Maid Marion. - Hm? I'm a friar, you know. Unh.Ha! Ouch. I have to get out of here. I have to help save Robin. But how? Oh, this could work. Closed inside these walls I think of you Counting all the things that we could do Hugging, kissing, spooning But this crowd just makes me moan I wish it were the two of us alone Too many wolves I see Too many mugs for me Too many chaps to tea 'Cause you are all I need Too many guys Oh, gee, heh Too many boys for me to phone Wishing that we two could be alone Too many wolves for me Takes too much energy Just do the math And see that you are all I need I only want one man I'm not a girl you can co-own - I'm glad that it's the two of us alone - I'm glad that it's the two of us alone Excuse me. I've come to rescue you. Well, thank you, but I seem to have rescued myself. Shh. Aah--! Ah! Right on schedule. Heh. - Marion. - Robin. - Oh, my darling. - Oh, I was so worried. You know, I haven't had my kiss yet. - Mm... - Woof. - Huh? - Woof, woof, woof. Eh, we can't find nobody, but we found this stuff in the prince's room. Don't look, son. I'll explain it when you're older. Wait. This is it. Plans for the ambush of King Richard as he comes ashore from France at dawn. We have to save him. But how will we get there in time? Hang on, my hearties! Whoa! It won't be long now, men. On my command. We're too late. It's worth a try. And... Fire! Oh! No. What in the name of heaven is going on here? We're saving your life, sire. It's a rescue. - Brace yourself! - Oh...! Unh! You men, come with me. The rest, stop them. Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Attack the king! I hope you're an adequate swordsman, my boy. Oh, I dabble. Yam Take that. Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha. - There you go. Watch your step. - Oh! Ha! Oh. It seems this is where your journey ends Robin Hood. And where I become king... ...upon my poor brother's sudden and quite unexpected demise. You may strike us down, but other heroes will rise up. Your days of tyranny are finished. Say, isn't that your cat? Not anymore. Aah! Stay still, you ungrateful wretch! Prepare to meet your maker, Robin Hoo--! Unh! Aah! Take that, mouseketeer! - Ha-ha! Where were we, brother? - Grrrr. Yeow! Ha! En Qarde, pip-squeak. - Is that cat and that mouse with you? - Yes, actually. I'm very glad they are. Me too, sire. You'll never beat me, aah, you useless rodent. Hm. Ha-ha-ha! Yah! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Stop, stop! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Ooh-hoo-hoo! Stop, stop! Oh! Whoa! Stop! Aah! Oh, we don't have to bring mother into this, do we? You're out-manned, cat. I'll take it from here. Hm? Aah! Die! I suppose you're wondering about this, uh, assassination thing. Well, it's a funny story. Heh-heh. Come back here. Ha! Ready to cut your losses... - ...Sheriff of Nothingham? - Huh? Mah! Aah! Oh! NO, no! This is all your fault, Sheriff of Nothingham. - Idiot! - Aah-ha-ha! Bravo, Jerry! You there, cat, mouse... ...take a knee. For heroic service in the name of justice, truth, honor and bravery... ...I dub thee Sir Tom Cat and Sir Jerry Mouse. Rise. So cheer our hero Who joins legends of old Raise a cup to Jerry The mouse who's brave and bold That is why we sing of little Jerry Mouse Jerry saved our king And beat that wretched louse He takes from the rich And to the poor he gives And with us merry men In Sherwood Forest lives And with us merry men - In Sherwood Forest lives - Oh-hoo-hoo! I believe I owe you something. Ah, yes. Yes, you do. Heh. Mm. I just love a happy ending. Don't you?
