[engine starting] OK, Mom, I'm ready to go now. MOM: OK, honey, have a good time. All right. MOM: Watch yourself. I will. Here's a little extra money. Oh, no, no. I've got enough to carry me, really. Take it anyhow, just in case. OK. Don't forget to call me when you get to the cottage, all right? Yes, I will. I will. Tracy, what the hell did you do that bus? Bye, Mom! Good morning. MOM: Good morning, Gene. Do you want any breakfast? No, Tracy'll be here any minute. DAD: It's not healthy to start the day without breakfast. You'll grow up to be an idiot. We'll get some on the way, Dad. MOM: Listen, does Tracy's uncle have a phone up there? You know, if I wanna call you in case of an emergency? Oh, Mom, it's only a summer cottage. Well, how do we know if you get there or end up in some ditch? I am not gonna end up in any ditch. I'll call you when I get there. I still think it's a lousy idea, taking a week off before you start college. You oughta stay home and study. What's there to study? I haven't even started yet. Well, there's a lot that I could prepare you on. Let's not start that again. Let him go. We're gonna have some peace and quiet around here for a change. And we don't have to listen to that "yah, yah, yah," for a while. Besides, what can you teach him? Plenty. Don't forget, I studied in the Navy or four years. How do you think I got where I'm at? Where I'm going, Dad, they don't teach plumbing. All right, then. Suit yourself. Just don't come running to me when you come hollering for help. And Gene, remember. I consider you a grown up, and I expect you to act like one. And be a gentleman. And stay away from the booze. And don't go near any crazy dope peddlers. Yeah, I don't want to coming back like some drunk hippie or dope fiend. Like, wow, Daddy-O. Man, I read your message. DAD: Don't be such a smartass. MOM: Well, he is smart. He did win a scholarship. Well, who paid the bills to put him through school? MOM: Well, big deal. You better believe it's a big deal. Who the hell paid for the food around here so you could feed that fat ass of yours? Well, who do you think cooked the food to fill that fat belly of yours? Cinderella? Let's go, the shit's about to hit the fan. I hear what you mean, Gene. [parents arguing] All right. What do you think of the bus? [dishes clattering] Ey? Dynamite. What are you gonna use this for? You never can tell. Yeah, I suppose not. What did you tell your folks? I mean, where we were going? Up to your uncle's place in the mountains. Oh, Christ. I told them I was going to your uncle's place. Let's hope they don't compare notes. [yelling] Oh, shit. I hate the sight of blood. [mother screaming] All right, where to? Doesn't matter. As long as it's near it's Stony Lake. That'll be fine with me. What's fine with you is fine with me. [music playing] What's that? Check it out. Check it out. Look. Aw, fucking hell! Not only that, I can plug into the speakers on the top so we can broadcast it, right? And, my man, we can communicate. [singing] Now, I would say here's to incredible feats and chickies we meet. [hollering] And to our right, we have two lovely young ladies in their basic Woolworths' [inaudible], accenting their voluptuous bosoms. Oh, they're so beautiful! Hello. Bye George, I think those two young ladies are trying to avoid us. I believe you're right, governor, actually. [honking] Any time you get tired, just yell and I'll drive. You bet your ass, I'll yell. You decided what you're going to do this year for your major? No, I don't got to decide. Shit, I don't even know if college is what I want. Have you-- do you know what you want? Yeah, women. No, seriously. I'm being serious. At least, I thought I was. I mean, who wants homes and babies and women and whatever? Who cares? I care. Man, you're not going to give me that bullshit about a career and all that stuff, man. When I go to university, I just want to go there and hang loose. Let whatever happens happens. You know, just-- oh, man. Just-- why do you ask yourself what's happening, where is it happening, when's it going to happen? Just get out and do it, man. Hell, I wish you were going to my school. You'd keep us loose. Get us kicked out too. [laughing] I know, man. But every time I bring it up to the old man, he has a fit. You know, he's got his thing about his alma mater. And he's paying the bills, so I really can't fight it, you know. Pilot to navigator. Pilot to navigator. Which way? Uh, left. -Right. -Not right. Left. Left. Right. To the right it is. Up yours, buddy. Ah, he wasn't cute anyway. Shit, man. What do you gotta do to get a ride around here? Oh, man, expose your tits. You know what I mean? No way. I don't want no John Law on my ass. Besides, I don't want to go home yet. Oh, well, the law is not gonna bother you. You know what I mean? Look, it'll take my ma weeks to find out I've split. You dig? Yeah, sure, sure. That's your ma. What about mine? BEA: Creeps! [music playing] Hey, what the hell is that? Sounds like a god damn parade. Wow. Oh, I don't believe this. -Man. -How do I look? Good? Yeah. What do you think? I think we're gonna get some action. SPARKY: Hi there. Hey, man. What's happening? Welcome to the Meat Wagon. Where are you headed for? Oh, wow, Bea, dig the bus. Oh, we're just bumming around. Where are you guys headed? We're just bumming around too. Hop in. Come on, Gene. Your turn to drive. You mean now? I'Oh, shit.. Hello. SPARKY: Hi. I'm Gene. I'm Sparky. I'm Tracy. What's your name? BEA: Me, I'm Bea. [tracy giggling] TRACY: Would you like a beer? Oh, wow. Look at that freaky dude. TRACY: Looks like he's in trouble. Oh, man, you'd better if he needs any help. Yeah, yeah. Wow, dig that freak's bike. Hi. Hi there. You need some help? Nope. You've got a groovy bike? You wanna take me for a ride? Nope. Real friendly, huh? TRACY: Can I have a shot at it? Yep, but it ain't gonna work. They don't call me Tricky Fingers Tracy for nothing. Be my guest. Where are headed for? Nowhere. [engine] Hey, man, I think you need gas. What do you about bikes? There's gas in that tank. You checked the tank, right? Well. I told you so. Look, we're going to get you fixed up. Yup. Live around here? Nope. Where you headed? Nowhere. He's a spooky dude, isn't he? Here you go. Hey, watch you don't get none on the tank. Yep. [inaudible] Whoa. [engine starting] There you go. -Yep. See you around. Yeah, bye! Take it easy. Yep. [bus engine starting] SPARKY: Oh, wow, look at him go. He's a really weird due. Shit, he must be going 100 miles an hour. Hey, where are you girls gonna stay tonight? Oh, we haven't decided yet. We're just hanging out. Hey, you want to stay with us? In this bus? Gee, man, I don't know. No, not in the bus. We got a big tent. We're gonna put up a big tent for the night. Oh, wow. Bea, did you hear that? They've got a tent. BEA: Oh, groovy. -You mean you want to? -Sure. Why not? BEA: Yeah. BEA: What are we stopping for? We're gonna get some eats. Come on, Tracy. Bea, get our dresses. What do you girls wanna eat? What do you men want? We're going to take care of the food, right Bea? Right. You guys want, uh, steaks or something? Well, we were thinking more like hamburger. Aw, shit. When we take care of the food, we do it right. You know what I mean? Look, you don't have to-- Hey, um, uh, maybe they can take care of the food. Maybe they got a lot of money or something, all right? What's with the dresses? These are our shopping dresses. Come on, Bea. Hey, wish us luck! TRACY: Hey, bring us some wine, too. Right on. You know, I don't know how they can get booze. They don't look old enough to me. Like, wow, Tracy, baby, like, give it to me. Like, outta sight, man. [inaudible]. You know, I still don't know what she means when she says, you know what I mean, baby? I just hope it works out, that's all. Here, where you going? I'm gonna go see if there's any camping sites, you know what I mean, baby? Well, I can sort of dig that. Oh, you want to come with me? No, because I have to go in there and fix up the cassette cause it's a little fuzzy. Check her. WOMAN: Hey. Hey, excuse me. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there. WOMAN: Oh, that's all right. I think I'm a little lost. Could you help me get back on Route 44? Sure. Hang on. I'll get my map. Where you headed for? Stony Lake. Oh, wow, that's where I'm going. Oh. Got a cottage up there? Yes, I have a cottage. Hey, that's great. It's OK. How about you? No, no, me and my buddy, we're just sort of roughing it. You know, camping out. -Oh. What, did I say something funny? No. Oh. It just sounds adventurous. Oh. I wish I could do that. Well, why can't you? Well, let's just say it wouldn't be easy for me. Um, uh, if you just stay right on this road here, and it'll veer right into number 44, and you'll be on your way. Thanks a lot. You've been a big help. Hey, where do you live up there? Oh, you can't miss it. It's the little white cottage off the main road. Hey, I didn't get your name. [clearing throat] Who was that? Oh, it-- just some lady. A lady, huh? Aw. Get in the bus quick. We gotta go. What the hell. The four of us supposed to eat this? Hey, well, what about the food? Well, you guys are stupid. Here, stash this stuff. Well, what do you think? I think we'd better get the hell out of here. Right. Man, this is really living, you know? Why can't it always be like this? Yeah. We get steaks and wine, good looking chicks. [laughing] And when are you going home? Listen, I don't want to talk about that scene, OK? Why? Because man, we don't want to go home. Yeah, but eventually, you gotta go home, right? No, man. We're never going home. And besides, if I went home, my old man would kill me. What'd you do? Aw, shit, man. It was nothing. We just borrowed a little money, and he got so pissed off. How much did you borrow? 500. Man, I was going to pay it back, and I was going to return the car too. But it wasn't our fault that the car got all smashed up? You know what I mean, man? Yeah, you know, it was fate. Like in the stars. [moaning] Oh, wow, groovy. Are you a virgin? No. Why do you said that to me? Well, my god, you haven't even touched me yet. You sure know how to make a girl feel like shit, you know what I mean, man? Oh, wow. [moaning] Yes. Tracy. [moaning] [moaning] [moaning] GENE: Tracy. Tracy. Tracy! TRACY: Down here. Hey, where are the chicks? I don't know. But they must be coming back. They left all their stuff here. Have you seen my radio? I can't find it. That's strange. What do you mean? Well, I was looking for my camera this morning to take some pictures, and I can't find it either. Oh, no. Kleptos, huh? [interposing voices] There's your radio, [inaudible]. Swimming, anyone? Would you look at this shit? -I know. They made out like a couple little pack rats, didn't they? Wonder if they planned on splitting from us. I don't know. I think we got the best of them, though. I hope so. [car engine] Let's put this stuff away. Here. Oh, man. Don't get uptight, like, we'll be right back. We're just gonna get our gear. [inaudible]. Good morning. Oh! Who's that out there? Oh. Oh, there's just old friends of ours we just met now. Yeah. Like, uh, they're headed just where we're headed. And where is that? Oh, you know. They're going our way. I bet they are. I hope you guys aren't mad cause we're splitting. No, no, no. We're not mad. It's a free country, right, Tracy? Right. Right. Oh, man. I knew you'd understand. Well, listen, we're just going to get our stuff now and split. I wonder what they're going to borrow from those, uh, suckers up there. Probably their car. Oh, man. Look, it's been great, you know what I mean? Like, we'll see you around. That's not very likely, if you know what I mean, man. Hey. Oh, look, you girls, you didn't forget anything now, did you? Oh, no. Oh, no, man. We got everything. Yeah, and look, we gotta go. Take it easy now. Bye. BEA: Let's go! Quick! SPARKY: Come on. Let's go! I'd give anything to see the look on their faces when they open those bags. Oh, We gotta go. it? Shit. What's the matter? They got away with my watch. GENE: Mama, don't start crying again. What? Look, tell Daddy I'm sorry he was late for work. I didn't know I took the alarm clock. Yeah, I got lots of money. Right, Mom, right. I'll wear socks so I don't get athlete's foot. Hey, Gene, wake up. We're gonna have some company here. How far you going? All the way to the very gates of heaven. What? I'm traveling the road to salvation hoping to save a few lost souls along the way. You know what the scriptures say. If a man says he loves God and hates his brother, that man is a liar. For all have sinned that come short of the glory of God. If even though I speak with the tongues of angels and have not mercy, then I am become a sounding brass and tinkling cymbal. I could go on and on showing you illustrations of this degenerate generation. Isn't this where you get off? Yes, this is where I get off. But where do you get off, brothers? I mean, I cannot leave you without saving your souls. My conscience wouldn't allow it. What do you mean? Well, you see, I belong to the Tabernacle of Holy Souls. And for a small amount, a small donation-- say, uh, $10-- my people will pay for the-- pray for the cleansing of your soul. $10? Well, $19 dollars is a small amount. You're talking about eternity. Just look at it as a small entrance fee for the great up there. Well, I got five. Bless you, brother. I got the other five. God bless, brother. God will remember this. God bless. God bless. How far are you going? All the way to the gates of heaven. Thank you. [flute playing in the distance] What do you got playing on the tape? Nothing. It's coming from over here. Right over in there somewhere. Wonder what's happening. I don't know. Do you think we ought to go and check it out? OK. We don't got a thing to lose. Yeah, all right. [flute playing] Hi. I'm Roger. And you are? I'm Tracy. And uh, this is my buddy Gene here. Sit. Welcome to our home, Gene and Tracy. Let me introduce you to my women. Deborah. Liza. Would you care to join us in some wine? Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Would you like a beer? No. We'll stick to the wine. But we could use some cigarettes. Oh, sure, man, here. Have one. You call this your home? That's just a figure of speech. Home is wherever we happen to settle. And where is home for you two? Oh. We're just bumming around. Yeah, we have a big tent. A tent? Would you like some cheese? Oh, no. We don't want to impose. Nonsense. What's mine is yours. Right, ladies? You're driving, I take it. Yes, we've been traveling in a bus. A bus? Would you care for some bread? Oh, no thanks. I'd like some. Let me ask you something. Do you like my women? Oh, yes. Lovely young ladies. You may share them with me. Huh? Is that so strange? We love all people. We believe in sharing what little we have with everybody. But unfortunately, most people don't believe in our philosophy. But I bet you do. Oh, us? Certainly. Me and Gene, we've believed in that for a long time. Right, Gene? Mm, mm. Fine. Relax. And remember, what's mine is yours. And what's yours is mine. [baroque flute music playing] [moaning] Yes. Yes. Oh, yeah. [moaning] Ow! [moaning] [moaning] Go put on some new tapes over there, will you? Yeah. I have some crazy sounds over there. All right. Hey Rog, look what I found. -Hey. -Hey, that's my camera. Now, we can get some pictures of ourselves. You guys don't mind, do you? Uh, I don't think so. Deborah, while you're over there, bring over some beers. We're very thirsty out here. Right, right. Here. This is paradise. You don't run into too many people that believe in the same philosophy. Yes, sharing can be very fulfilling. By the way, how much money do you guys have? Not much. Couple of dollars, why? I thought we could all head south on the bus tomorrow, right girls? Yeah! That's a great idea. Come on, let's drink up. Great. Get this booze out of the way. Let's get smashed. Here's a toast to our new friends. Right. To Gene and Tracy more, hoping that we will never separate on our journey. [tracy groaning] [WHISPERING] Shut up. Shut up. There's someone outside. What is it? Somebody's outside for sure. Who? Shh. [engine running] What do you think? I don't know. I don't know what I think. These people could sleep through a small war. [laughing] Yeah, they god stoned on our booze. How are gonna get rid of them? I know. Is that everything? I think so. TRACY: What about the sleeping bag? Fuck. I can't get it, because I'll wake them up. Fuck it, let's split. Second cup? No thank you. Yeah, right here. There you go. Would you like anything for dessert on the menu? Um, no thanks, I'm full. Not unless you're on the menu. You'll have to ask the boss. He's my husband. We'll have the check, please. Sure. Chickens. You know, you're going to get our asses killed. [cash register dinging] Hey, is that your bus out there? Yeah, why? Oh, nothing. Just wondering. Hey, you got a really nice set up there. Yeah, it's OK. You guys just passing through? Yeah, eventually on our way to Stony Lake. Yeah, if we ever get there. You from around here? Yeah. I'm Fred. Hey, I'm Tracy. This is Gene. Howdy. Is there, uh, anything exciting happening around here? Nothing. The place is dead. Only thing that happens exciting around here is the beer blast at the firehouse, and that happens once a year. That sounds like fun. Yeah, whoopee. Yeah, but I mean, what about the women though? Oh, they lock them up at sunset. All except Regina. Who's Regina? Regina is the only chick that swings around here. She's sort of the town nympho. Get the picture? Yeah, have you got one? Is she nice? Yeah, she's OK. Why? Uh, you guys, uh, interested? Yeah. Yeah, we're always interested. Well, shit, you got the wheels. Come on, I'll take you there. But you gotta pick up a couple of cases first. Couple of cases? Well, sure. Well, you know, to turn her on. You guys game? Why not? DJ: Here we are again with sweet sounds from summer nights. Stick with me, and I'll turn you on. [music playing] [burps] Gimme another one. Hey, uh, when's she gonna get turned on? I mean, we're into the second case of beer already. Hey, don't worry. You'll get some action. It's not the action I'm worried about. It's my kidneys. You think she'll still be alive when we get to her? [snickering] Here you go, Regina. I could dance all fucking night. [SINGING] I could dance all night. I could dance all night. [burps] Is it hot in here? Yeah, it is hot. Let us take your clothes off, hey? That's what I love. Subtlety. Why should I? I know what you guys want. You think I'm dumb, huh? Well, Regina here is very, very smart. I don't need anybody to tell me when to take my clothes off. I'll take them off when I fucking feel like it. Come on, Fred. Dance with me. Oh. This feels good. You're turning me on. It's about time. You wanna go first? Yeah. DJ: Hey, kids, how did that one feel? It's time for a change of pace. Let's cook a little. [music playing] Well? Well, I've had better, but then ahead, I've had worse too, you know? -Let's flip for it. -Why not? Heads. Shit. I'm always last. [breathing heavily] Gimme another beer, will you? Where do you want it? [moaning] [moaning] [moaning] DJ: Now, for the climax of this hour, here's the hottest new group in the country. [music playing] [moaning] Hey, Regina. It's your old buddies. How's the old body, baby? Hey, Fred, what's happening? You get any lately? Hey, we got some beer here. Hey, that's ours. Not anymore it ain't. Visiting hours are over, boys. The men are here now. Ain't that right, Regina. Yeah, lover. Hey, man, you just can't push us around like that. Why not? Because, man, you can't. That's why not. You think you're man enough to do something about it? You know what we do to punks like you around here? Let's go, Tracy. Bye bye, boys. Thanks for the, uh, beer. [door closes] Those fucking freaks, man. Start the truck. I'm gonna fix their asses. What are you gonna do? You'll see. Yes? Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to bother you, but my friend and I, we were driving in our bus. And we saw these three guys. They were dragging this girl into that garage over there. We didn't know what to do, whether to call the police or what. My garage? Who were they? I don't know. I think I heard one of the guys call the girl Regina. Regina? Hey, thanks. I'll take care of this. What'd you ask him? Shh, here he comes. Come on, let's get the hell out of here. [gunshots] [motorcycle engine] There he goes again. [inaudible] Hey, hey, hey, look up there. Looks like they made out like bandit. Let's moon 'em. Woo! [laughing] [motorcycle engine] GENE: I wonder what he's doing up here? I don't know, but he's beginning to give me the creeps. Why don't we go and check him out? Is there anything I can do for you? Nope. What you doing around here? Riding. I can see that. Isn't there anywhere else you could ride? Like where? Well, maybe somewhere, you know, not so close. OK. Man, that's one bad mother. Yeah. What are you all dressed up for? I'm just going for a walk along the lake. Uh-huh. What's her name? Oh, man. Can't I just take a walk along the lake? Sure. So long. [laughing] That's not so funny. I'm sorry. I know it's not funny, but the way you look. So do you do this to everything that comes here? No, not everyone. Just the people I want to meet. Yeah? Well, what if they don't want to meet you? Well, that's just a chance I have to take. Where'd you go? Would you cut that out? Why? You make me nervous. Where are you going? Home. Why? Why not? See you around. When? How's 4 o'clock? OK. Hey, you didn't say where? [moaning] [breathing heavily] [moaning] [moaning] [breathing heavily] Are you hungry? Not anymore. I mean for food. Yeah, I could go for some. I bet you were kind of surprised when you saw me at the door, right? Yes. I-- I was. This doesn't happen to me. Well, I mean, this is the first time. Where's, eh, he at? Oh, minding the shop as usual. Seems it's all he has time for. Business, the big deal. Sometimes, I forget how-- I'm sorry this happened. No, I'm not. Glad it did. Oh, you would be. You have nothing to lose. Well, you know, I-- I don't have to stay here. You know, I can go. I mean-- [church bell chiming] Tracy, please stay for lunch. OK. Guess who. Oh, um, Juliette. No. Helen of Troy? No. Tokyo Rose. No. Marahari. Nope, you lose. What is your name, anyway? Does it matter? GENE: Sure it matters. I don't want to have an affair with a no name girl. Why not? You'll forget it anyway. OK. Have it your own way, Miss No Name. You from around here? Yes. Well, where? What do you want to know for? Don't tell me. You can't have an affair with anybody unless you know where they live, right? Are you nuts? Nuttier than a fruitcake. Want to taste? Um, can I help you get something? WOMAN: Oh, no. You go ahead. OK. Mm, this is really good. You don't suppose we could meet again, do you? Not-- not here. It's too difficult. You see, I have-- Oh, you don't-- look, you-- you don't have to explain. I understand. But maybe-- maybe we could meet somewhere else. OK? OK. Who's that? Oh, somebody is here. Hi. Ed, you're back early. This is Tracy. Hi, Tracy. Hi, Ed. You gonna be staying around here? Uh, yeah. I'm going to be in the area for a couple of days. Oh, well, then I'll see you around. Yeah. ED: Hey, Mom, did you see where my fins went to? Try your room, Ed. Maybe I'd better go. You're wonderful, Miss No Name. I like you. Where you going? Home. Why? Cause I have to. Well, can I walk with you? It's not possible. Hey, you can't just leave like this. Why? Can we talk? A little while? Why? Why? Why? Because I want to see you, damn it. I'm sorry. It's not possible. Light me one too, will you? Sure. What's the matter? Nothing. Can't sleep. I keep thinking about going back home tomorrow. And then there's next week. Yeah, but there'll be other summers. No, not like this one. You know, somehow, I feel like I'm losing my freedom. Bullshit. [motorcycle engine] Jesus. I wonder what he's up to now? Does he ever sleep? You know? You know, I really think that he's following us around. It does sound like a lot of traffic out there. Wonder what's happening up at the lake. I don't know. [knocking] MAN: Come on out, punks. Jesus Christ, I wonder who's out there. Maybe you'd better go have a look. Quick, Gene. No, maybe you'd better go have a look. No, no, no, no. You go. Go ahead. Go ahead. No, go ahead. Well, if I go, I'm not going alone. MAN: Come on, Mommy. TRACY: Come on! OK. MAN: Come on out, little boy. Your mother's calling. Oh, here come the big shots. Hey, could you turn those lights out? Why? Do the lights hurt your eyes, little boys? You don't know who we are, do you? You remember sweet Regina? You almost got our asses blown off back there. Well, you're gonna wish you never messed around with us, cause we don't like squealing punks. [grunting] [motorcycle engine] [engine starting] [engine starting] That was some strange dude, wasn't he? [singing] [SINGING] At the lake, at the lake, where old Sally [inaudible] burning of my heart roll away. It was there [inaudible] and I'll see my watch, and I will be happy all the day. [laughing] Hey, there he is again. GENE: Here's to old faithful. And Regina. [laughing] And Sparky and Bea. And to your watch. Fuck you. And here's to Roger Dodger. And his lovely little angels. [laughing] And here's to school. And home. And freedom. [music playing]
