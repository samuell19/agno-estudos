I said get in the back andtry to stop this thing. He can't do anything. He didn't even slow it. It was really something else. Hey, Tommy, I think we canborrow that boat again. Swell. I can't wait to get back upthere. I'm going to try single skiingthis time. Look, it's easy. We'll just say, come on, let'sgo up to the room. Expects that. That's too pushy. We would have been arrestedfor smuggling over here, and now you are worried about being toopushy. I'm going to ask her. I still can't reach him. Is there anything we can do? You have done enough already. Thank you, Kenny, Tommy, Mike. I really appreciate everythingyou have done. Good-bye. Anna! Why don't you come up and waitin our room.

Well, I put them both out in the backyard to play by themselves, but I watched themfrom my bedroom window. God, it was horrible, Kenny. Colonel howled and howled. Dad had to come out and turn ahose on them. What a stupid thing toremember. People aren't like dogs. Of course not. Come on. You know they are not. Yeah. Boy. It's about time. We were getting worried aboutya. What is the matter? Nothing is the matter. What are you sore about? Who is sore. How was it, Mike? There is nothing to tell. How did you get started whatdid you say first? Hey, where are you going? Down to the coffee shop. Mike! Does she talk a lot? What is with him? Beats me. I thought you were supposed tobe happy afterwards. I mean, I always am. Call it. Heads... tails. A bad day is a bad bay. Anna? Anna? Anna? Anna, it's Tommy! Tommy? What is it? Look, Anna, I know you do this kind of thing for a living, and I'll give you all themoney, I have got. Just do me one favor. Please tell Mike and Kenny, thati was really terrific, and we had a really great time. And I'll just sit here, andthat's going to be it. And when the time is up, and youthink I have been here long enough, well, just tell me, andguile out, and no one will know what really happened, because... see, I made myself a promise, that I wouldn't do this until I was married, but if I told Mike and Kenny that, theywould laugh at me. They would just laugh at me. That's all. Is that all right with you? Is that all right with you? $11.17, and it's all yours, if you just promise to tell the guys I was great. I see. What's the matter? Tell me, who is coming innext? Well, Kenny. Oh. Hey, Anna, you won't tellthem about me, will ya? No. Thanks a lot, Anna. I sure appreciate this. Tommy? Yeah. The money isn't necessary. Oh, Anna, you are terrific. Yeah, that's the word for me, terrific. Hey, thanks, Anna. You are the greatest. Well, Kenny. She is all yours. Where are you going? Down in the coffee shop. I really worked up an appetite. What is it with you guys? Will you just tell me? What is to tell? What happened? She was the greatest. What did you do? What did I do? What did I do? You have got to be kidding. Hello? It's me. Oh, Michael, I have beentrying to get you. I left word at the motel thati couldn't make it. Didn't they tell you. Yes, I got the message, butthere wasn't any explanation. What the hell are you doinghere? I'm here to see you, of course. Why don't you pick me up now. What do I tell my wife? She is sitting in the otherroom? Well, tell her anything. What have you been telling herall these months anyway? Anna, we can't see each otheranymore. I don't understand. It's over, Anna. I'm sorry. What do you mean, it's over? Good-bye. Michael! Michael? Who it is? Well, it's Kenny, can I comein? No, go away. I'm sorry, Anna. Why should you be sorry? I was listening at the doorwhen you were on the phone. It was not important. It was just another chapter inanna's life. Why won't he see you? It's not important. Do you love him? What are you going to do now? Go back to Canada? I guess so. You might have some troublegetting across the border. I better go with you. After you have had your turnwith me of course! Well, I'm sorry to disappointyou, but I'm leaving! And I would appreciate it if youwould get out of this room so I can get dressed! Can I ask you something, please? What? If you hadn't gotten thatphone call just now, I mean, if you weren't upset, would youstill? What is it? Did I do something wrong? Please tell me. It's really important I know. I don't think I understand. Why it is okay with Mike andtommy, and not with me? What is wrong with me? There is nothing wrong withyou. Yes, there is. I'm not the same as other guys. Like Mike, he has had a lot ofgirls. To be real honest, I... I nevereven had one. Oh, this is always happening. What is? This. Like about a year ago, when itook out Sheila Dixon, Sheila is a school... what every guy in myclass has taken her out at one time or another. And everybody knows, you know, and so I... I took her out, and she wouldn't let me. It's just like now... Kenny! Please, sit down. Sheila sounds like a girlwith a lot of problems. What happened that night, I'msure had more to do with her than to do with you. How could that be? All of the other guys that tookher out had a great time with her. But how do you know they hada great time? They said so? I think you'll find young menyour age tend to exaggerate when it comes to their experienceswith woman. Maybe so, but at least they had something to exaggerate. What is it about me that girlsdon't like? Is it the way I look? Oh, no, Kenny. Then... then what is it? You know in many ways, youand I are alike. We have no confidence inourselves. If anyone should haveconfidence in themselves, it's you. You are beautiful. Evidently not everything thinks so. You could have a dozen guysif you wanted. I don't want a dozen. Well, I'm always available. You are very sweet, Kenny. I wouldn't worry about your lackof experience. The time hasn't been right yet, that's all. When will it be right? Oh, Kenny. You know, you and I do have thesame problems, we feel we're getting older, and life ispassing US by. You just haven't met theright guy yet. Now who is giving advice? Hi. Hi. Things go all right? What are you guys going todo now? Now look who is not talking? Are you going to stay inbuffalo for a while or what? We were talking about goingto silver Springs tomorrow. Why? I was just wondering. Listen, Anna is getting dressed, so you can have your room back in a few minutes. Where is she going? Back to Canada. Did she say anything aboutme? No. Hey, maybe we can go to themovies or something. I can't. I'm taking Anna back to theborder. Why? She might have troublegetting across. She won't have any trouble. Besides you will be up half thenight. I already told her I would. Hey, you are still coming tosilver Springs aren't you? Sure. We'll talk about it tomorrow. We're leaving tomorrow. I still have to work it out with my grandmother. Kenny, I thought we were allset. Hey, you know something, idon't think he made it with her. Me either. I love you, Anna. I really do. It will pass. I don't want it to. It will. Every young man must have hisfill of conquests before he really loves, and I think you'llfind I make a far better conquest than a love. I don't understand. You don't have to understand. It will happen anyway. I guess you'll be going back to that bar now? No, Kenny. I'm not going back there. I never worked in that bar. I was just using the telephone. And you assumed I belongedthere. But Mike and Tommy, they saidthat... But I told you, young mentend to exaggerate. But if you are not... you arenot from that bar... I mean, why... why... why did youlet... Anna!
