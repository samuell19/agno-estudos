[bright music] [light orchestral music] [children giggling] [brakes screeching] [glass shattering] [people screaming] [sirens wailing] [car horns honking] - Could you spare some money for the tooth fairy? Well thank you, thank you so much, you're so sweet. Hello there, I know what you're thinking. You think I'm gonna ask you for money and well I am, but it's not for what you think. You see, I am the tooth fairy and I need your spare change to give to the deserving children of the neighborhood. - Sh. - No? Well, hello, do you have any spare change for the tooth fairy? Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh jeez. - Yo, Briefcase. Spare some change for Santa's hippest helper? [laughing] Gotta give back to the North Pole before the big day. - You still going with the elf bit? - Well Christmas is only a few months away. Any brother or sister with holiday cheer be giving their change to me. Check out my new elf dance. - Oh yeah. Whoa, whoa big fella. Originality is what made this country great. Remember I said that. - [Muskat] I'll write it down. - You better. Could you spare some change for the tooth fairy fund? [air whooshing] Oh excuse me. Home sweet home, yes sir. [groans] Oh, that's getting pretty ripe. Where's my girls? Hey, girls where you gone? Ah, here's my girls. Yeah, here's my girls. Hi girls. Me? I had a pretty good day. Yeah, everybody at the office says hi. [chuckles] [gentle music] [girl laughing] [Briefcase sobbing] There's my love. [upbeat music] Oh hey little girl, hello, hi, I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Briefcase and I am a tooth fairy. - So, why do they call you Briefcase? - Well 'cause when I first moved here I used to carry a briefcase. What's your name? - Mary Elizabeth, but no one calls me that except my mother. Everybody calls me Lizbeth. - Well, it's nice to meet you, Lizbeth. - Well, bye. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, Lizbeth, Lizbeth, did you happen to lose a tooth? - Sure, lots of times. - [Briefcase] And didn't the tooth fairy give you money? - No. - No? Oh well that must have been before I was the tooth fairy in this territory. I guarantee that the next time that you lose a tooth, the tooth fairy is gonna give you money, how's that sound? - Well I won't hold my breath. - Hey, hey, you know, you're about the oldest little girl I ever met. Who told you not believe in the tooth fairy? - Too old to believe in stuff like that. - No, you ain't never too old to believe in stuff like that. - My mum said you people who ask for change in streets are winos and no-account drunks. - Oh, well your mum is right, but you know, sometimes people can be two things at once. Take me for example, I am a wino, but I'm also the tooth fairy. Hey, look at this. Last night I had to visit a little girl just like you. I went into her house and I found that and I put some money under her pillow. See, see, that's how it works. - You could have gotten that anywhere. - Well of course I could. You kids lose your teeth everywhere you know, but I gotta find 'em just the same. You know, sometimes it takes me a couple of extra days but I always get there. You just have to have faith. You know what faith is? - Yeah, it's what you need to believe in stuff, like God, even though you never see Him. Bad things always happen. - Well yeah, I mean I guess that's one way to define it, but I mean it's a bad way for you because, you know, you're so young and all. - Ho, ho, ho. - Give it a rest will ya, Muskat? See, faith is like that Lizbeth, but if you lose your faith in everything, like God and the tooth fairy, well, then you're gonna be sad all the time. You don't wanna be sad all the time do ya? - No. My mommy said it's not nice for little girls to cry. - Well your mom is certainly right about that. Especially on airplanes. Never, ever cry on airplanes. - Mary Elizabeth, get over here right now! What are you doing? - [Lizbeth] I have to go now, bye. - Bye. Boy, that is one mixed up little girl. Could you imagine her not having faith in God or anything? - You don't. - We are talking about the little girl, Muskat. - Two, I thought it was four. Oh man. [door thuds] Mary Elizabeth, is that you? I have a surprise. - It's just me, baby. [laughs] What are you up to? - What are you up to? - Nothing, just calm down, baby. - Don't you baby me. I don't want that in the house. Mary Elizabeth is gonna be home soon. She could find it. - Will you be cool, I'm gonna hide it in a place where she'll never find it. - I want you and that thing out of my house. [dramatic music] - [sighs] Home sweet... [somber music] Oh no. Oh no, no. Baby, baby [sobbing]. No, no, please, no! I got you, I got you. [Briefcase sobbing] - Ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho. - Briefcase, Briefcase. My friend Resa said she got visited by the tooth fairy. - Yeah, well look kid, you know, now is not a really good time. - Did you really give her that 10 bucks for her tooth? - [snickers] 10 bucks, $10, yeah, sure, I mean yeah, you know I mean, she's a good kid you know and she went through a lot of pain, so she gets the big bucks. - Resa thinks it was her father who put the $10 under her pillow. - Well, you know, usually I let the daddy do the leg work. See, that way the dad and the kid, they get some quality time together. Any more questions before you go? - What if you don't have a daddy? - Oh. Well, well, then I guess I have to do that by myself. You know, with my tooth fairy magic. [laughs] - [Lizbeth] Really? - Yeah. [Muskat laughing] What? - Yeah B, why don't you show us a little of your tooth fairy magic? - Well you know I'm still trying to recharge myself from last night, but I'm sure I can muster up a little power, you know what I'm saying? - Can you? - Give me a quarter. - What? - Give me a quarter. [bright music] There's your magic trick. Ready? Watching, ready, watch closely. [breath blowing] [Briefcase laughing] - You really must be the tooth fairy. - See now you're getting it. - Oh yeah, now I'm Santa's helper. - There is no Santa Claus. - [Briefcase] Sure there is. Well did your mom tell you that? - No, it's just he didn't come last year or the year before that. So what good is he? - Well you know, Santa's had a couple of problems over the last couple of Christmases, you know I mean, last year, last year he had that reindeer, broke a hoof, you know and then they had to shoot him in the head over Greenland. - Santa shoots his reindeer? - Oh no, no, no, not Santa, no, no, it was this mean dwarf. - Elf. - Elf, yeah, it was a mean elf. Yeah. - Stinky. - Yeah, Stinky, Stinky the Elf, yeah. - I don't like Stinky the Elf. - So, Lizbeth, come sit down. You know being a tooth fairy in this area, you know I was looking in my records and well I noticed that well, that you haven't put any money into the tooth fairy fund. - The tooth fairy fund? - Well yeah you see, well Santa Claus, he works pro bono, that means for free, but the tooth fairy you see, they can only operate if you put money into the tooth fairy fund. - Oh man. - Hey hey, those aren't my rules. Right, it's the head tooth fairy's rules and you know, I'm telling you, Lizbeth, he is a hard case. - Is he part wino too? - No, no, no, no. To be head tooth fairy you gotta be all tooth fairy. I mean and some day I might become head tooth fairy, but now I gotta follow the rules and what, what was your friend's name? - Resa. - Resa, well see Resa looking at my records, I saw that Resa had already put money in. See, being a member of the tooth fairy fund, well it's like being in social security. You gotta put money in before you can take money out. - Hatcha matcha. - Put in? - Put that money in. Before you can get any out. You understand? [Muskat laughing] - And then Briefcase, he tells her that the tooth fairy operates the same way as social security. You gotta put money in to take some out. - I had the heebie jeebies, you know, you guys know, I'm sweating it. I'm itching and stuff. - And then this little girl, I mean the sweetest little girl you ever wanted to see, she looks up at him and she says, "I wanna put in to the tooth fairy fund. "Will you take these cans?" [laughing] - All right, all right, that's enough I say, enough, enough! - [Muskat] You're the king, Briefcase. You are the freakin' tooth fairy king. [guffaws] See, he knows how to deal with them kids, 'cause he had one. - Hey, hey, hey you would have done the same thing. The same [gasping] - [Man] Briefcase you all right? - Jimmy, Jimmy, help me. - Briefcase, Briefcase. [somber music] [monitor beeping] [Briefcase snores] [Briefcase gasping] - Hey, hey, take it easy now. - I'm not dead? - Take it easy, go slow. - Oh, Preacher. [sighs] Oh, don't tell me I'm in that lousy clinic of yours. - The very same. - [sighs] Any port in a storm I guess. - You're lucky to be alive. - Yeah, maybe I should buy a lottery ticket. Couldn't hurt, right. - I'm gonna read this to you. Myocardial infarction, that's a heart attack. Based on your echo cardiogram, your heart's in pretty dismal shape and your liver enzymes are high. So on the verge of failure. - What are you a doctor now? - It doesn't take a doctor to see what a mess you're in. - I did see a white light. No, no, that was Sinatra singing at the Sands. No, no, maybe that was just a paramedic shocking me back to life, huh? [laughs] - You know the lack of oxygen to your brain has not affected your sarcasm. What it is with you Briefcase, how can you be so smart and not see how bad your situation is? - I guess it's the same way you call shrimp jumbo. [laughs] - I don't know how to tell you this. But in Dr. Thompson's opinion, you only have a year to live, two at the most if you're lucky. - Is that a joke? 'Cause if you're joking, you better work on your bedside manner, Preacher. Are you joking or are you just trying to trick me? - We're not the Mayo Clinic, we could be wrong. Maybe you'll live 10 years if you just take care of yourself. - Or I could die next week, is that what you're sayin'? That I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die alone in a filthy gutter? - I mean how could you expect to live the way you were living, and not have a bad-- - I don't need you preaching at me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but what I meant was, this is a lot to take in in five minutes. I just wanna be alone. [gentle music] - Stay as long as you like. [monitor beeping] [traffic whooshing] [chips crunching] - [Clerk] Rummie, how you doing today? - Can't believe it, it's like I'm on autopilot. - You know I was just reading about you in the newspaper. Did you know that 10% of the boozers out there account for 99% of all the alcohol sales. - You're full of all sorts of fun facts today, aren't ya? - [Clerk] Hey, if it wasn't for you, I'd be out of business. What'll it be today? - Is this stuff supposed to be good for ya? - Well it's the healthiest of the jerky family. 99% fat free. But Olympians don't train on it. - Well, I'll take one. - And? - And, hey two years is a long time, wouldn't you say? - [laughs] Yeah, especially if somebody is poking ya in the butt with a sharp stick. [both laughing] - Yeah, ah heck, give me a pint of penicillin. - Huh? - Vodka. - Oh, okay, yeah. - Hey, how much is this? - Not enough, you don't have enough money. - Make it a half pint then. - There is nothing in there to drink. - Yeah, I know. - [Clerk] It's a pinwheel. - I know, I want it anyway. - You can't drink this. - Hey, look what is this? Can't a guy buy a pinwheel? - I'm willing to go along with you on the jerky thing, 'cause a man's gotta eat. But the rest of the 10% of the boozers are gonna be very disappointed in you, Rummie. You're not maximizing your alcohol purchase here. - Look, just ring me up. - Okay. Change. - Thanks a lot. - Briefcase, I'm telling you, [laughs] you really scared me there. - Who needs extreme sports when we got extreme living. - Yeah, [chuckles] so, you gonna do anything different? - I don't think so, I don't know, maybe. - Well that was quick. [bright music] Hey, here comes your little ray of sunshine. [chuckles] You know, she looks kinda irate, I'll see you back in a bit. - Yeah. - Resa said she didn't put money into the tooth fairy fund. And neither did her father. - Well, I never tell the daddies. You know, daddies have to sign a confidentiality agreement. Hey, come on up here and sit with me, come on. Now, I was looking in my records, and well I noticed that you're owed some back gifts from both Santa and the tooth fairy. So, here we go, nothing up my sleeves. A little tooth fairy magic. Then, surprise. [Briefcase laughs] It's a pinwheel. - Well, what does it do? - Well you know, you run along with it and the wind blows through it and it spins around. - It looks kinda lame to me. - Oh. Well, well, you know Santa always gives the lamest back presents first, but you know, they get better. Here, why don't you give it a try. [bright music] Well, get up and move around with it. Yeah. Back and forth. Here, you know, let me show you, let me show you. - Like that. - Yeah, hold it out like that and let it catch the wind, there. Try running with it, see what what happens, yeah. Run, run, run. Run, run with it, yeah. Look at it spinning, huh? [chuckles] Lizbeth? Lizbeth? Lizbeth, Lizbeth? [Lizbeth sobbing] You're not supposed to fall with it, you're supposed to run with it. Don't cry, don't cry. Remember little girls who cry aren't pretty. Think of happy things like puppy dogs and dollies and stuff like that. What? - Look at this. - Well, that's great. Now the tooth fairy's gonna give ya-- - And Resa only got $10 dollars and I went through more pain than her, huh? - Well. - Good thing I just to put money into the tooth fairy fund, huh? - Well, that's always a good thing. - What was that thing, you know that thing that I have to do before I get my tooth fairy money? - Be fully vested. - Fully vested, well I am. [Briefcase chuckles] Are you still the tooth fairy or are you gonna change your story now? - Lizbeth, I am the tooth fairy. - Okay then, this will be waiting for you under my pillow. Bye, Briefcase. - [groans] $10. [bright upbeat music] - Yeah, here you go. - No, sorry. - [Man] Here. - [Woman] Get away. - [Man] I don't have anything. - [Man] No, no. - No, no, stop, sorry, sorry, don't. - [Clerk] Get outta here. - Hey, hey, hey. $11. I need 11 one dollar bills. - That's some real money there. Special occasion, birthday? - [Briefcase] $11, please. - Yeah, I heard you the first time, now what do you want? Man could have himself a real party on $11, Rummie. - No, I didn't come in for that, you know, I gotta do something else. I just want 11 bills for my change. - Look, this ain't Bank of America, you gotta buy something. - Look, I just need the money, okay, please. - How about this bottle of rum? Ronrico, huh. $15 marked down to 9.95. I drink this stuff. - [Briefcase] No, no. Here, I'll take this gum. - I can tell you really got something going there. Sure that's $11. - Yeah, man, I'm sure, I'm sure. - All right, one, two, three. [horns honking] - Oh, Lizbeth, Lizbeth. [gasps] There you are. [laughs] And here you are, from the tooth fairy to you. It's yours and then we're done. - That's not the way the tooth fairy does it. - Look kid I gotta get a, I got bigger things to worry about. - The tooth fairy puts money under the pillow. - Well, that's the way the tooth fairy used to do it, but now we do all sorts of different things, like sometimes we wire the money right into your bank account, but since you don't have a bank account, you don't have a bank account do ya? - No. - No, well then we do it like this. Go on, take it. - Yeah, but I didn't even give you my tooth. - Well, you can owe it to me. - If you're the tooth fairy, you put money under my pillow where my tooth is. - [groans] Nothing's gonna be easy is it? I suppose it's all my fault. Another big joke at my expense. Okay, okay, fine, we'll do it the old way. The old out of date, the old I'll put it under the pillow way, okay. Fine, all right, then you'll have to believe in the tooth fairy and Santa, and God and you'll have to have a little faith then, right? Okay then, just a little bit of faith, okay? Okay. - Okay. - It's settled, where do you live? - What? - Where do you live? - You don't know? - Well I, I, you live here. - [Lizbeth] Which apartment? - Which apartment? Well I, I've got that written down in my tooth fairy records. You know, Lizbeth, I can't be expected to remember everything. [laughs] - [Cyril] Is there a problem here? - Hey just buzz off.. Oh, no, no, no, no, no problem. No problem at all. [somber music] [wagon rattling] [cans clunking] [gentle music] [Muskat snoring] [Muskat groaning] - What happened? - A flash flood, now wake up, I told you what I wanted to do, do you remember? I told you this afternoon. - Yeah, yeah I remember. You said, oh no, no, no, are you crazy? Briefcase! Do you know what will happen if the police catch you sneaking into some little girl's window to put money under her pillow? - You make it sound sick. - Oh boy, just go on and give the girl the money. It's a good thing you're doing, Briefcase, what does it matter if she believes your hatchy matchy, you hate it when the preacher does that. - Yeah, when he does it that's totally different. I mean, when he's doing, he's trying, you see what I'm trying to do is... Nevermind the freakin' logic of the situation, that little girl needs to believe in stuff like the tooth fairies actually exist. - Oh boy, you better get home, let me sleep. - [Briefcase] Don't make me fill up this bottle. - Okay, I'm up. - [Briefcase] All right come on. - I'm up. - [Muskat] Get up. - Shoes on. - Come on! - All right, all right, all right. - [Briefcase] Got it? - [Muskat] Oh man you have really let yourself go. - Okay. - I'm just saying, maybe light beer from now on. - [Briefcase] You're buying the beer. You wait for me here. Wait. - All right. I'll wait, I'll wait. [dogs distant barking] [crickets chirping] [window clicking] [window scraping] [suspenseful music] [toe thuds] - Sh. [distant TV chattering] [door creaking] [envelope rustling] [clock ticking] [door creaking] [distant TV chattering] - He said wait, I'm gonna wait. He's my buddy so I'm gonna wait. Wish I had a watch. Okay, okay, okay. [TV chattering] [door clicking] [toy squeaks] [upbeat music] [door creaking] [Briefcase groaning] We gotta go, we gotta go. - [Briefcase] You got me, catch me. [body thudding] - [Muskat] No wait, let's go, come on. - [Briefcase] I thought you were gonna catch me. - [Muskat] I thought you was gonna wait. - Wow. [both panting] $11, I got more than Resa, yes. [both laughing] - Oh man, I would have peed my pants if I'd seen Cyril standing there. Ooh very scary. [laughs] [wagon rattling] - [Lizbeth] It's true, what you said is really true. - [laughs] Oh course it is. - I can't wait to tell all my friends and mommy. - Well no, that's not the best idea. You know a better idea would be to keep it a secret, all right. Especially from mommy and well, whoever else she talks to. - Why? - Well, see we tooth fairies we act like a secret club, you know, and without our secrets, well, we couldn't do our job half as well. Because, you know, and then all the people would know are aforementioned secrets. So, you think you can keep all this a secret? - Well yeah, I think so, but I have to tell Resa, 'cause she only got $10. - [Briefcase] Well, okay you can tell Resa, but that's it, all right. Now, look I wanna talk to you about something really important. - I can't right now, I gotta go home for dinner. Mom gets mad if I'm late. - [Briefcase] Yeah, but it'll just take two seconds. - [Lizbeth] Later, then I'll show you my secret hideout. - Ah yeah [sighs]. [sirens wailing] Oh jeez, couldn't your secret place be a little easier to get to? - Well, then everyone would be here. - Yeah, well, yeah I guess overcrowding could ruin a place like this. [groaning] Hey, isn't kind of late for you to be out, especially on a school night. - Yeah, but my homework's all done. - What about your mom, won't she be worried? - She's gonna be at Cyril's tonight. - Oh, you know, speaking of Cyril. I saw you yesterday doing, doing what you might call an errand for him. - [Lizbeth] He gives me money to run errands. - You know, Lizbeth, those errands aren't really good. - I know but mommy and I need the money. - Mommy and you need the money. - [Lizbeth] Mm-hmm. - Yeah, there it is. [laughs] - Briefcase. - Lizbeth, slow down. I told you you shouldn't be running like that. - [laughing] Especially in airports. Ever. - I have to tell my mommy about you being the tooth fairy. - Oh, no, no, no, no, remember what we talked about? Remember what I said? It's best that mommy-- - And her boyfriends. - That's right, they don't know our... - Yes, yes. - My true identity, right? We talked about this. - I know but today I was telling Gina, that's Resa's friend, about you being the tooth fairy and a wino and they didn't believe me. - Oh he's gonna find out. He can't find out, you know who I'm talking about. He cannot find out. - Then what happened? - And then I told them about how I got into the system by putting money into the tooth fairy fund, but they didn't believe that either. - Well you know, Lizbeth, some kids are like that, you know I mean, well in the tooth fairy business we call those kids-- - Idiots. - We call those kids idiots, yeah. You know, so what's the problem, huh? - Then when she said that you were a dirty old wino, and not the tooth fairy I hit her, pow, right in the nose. [Briefcase laughs] - You did that for me? - Yeah, but then she told our teacher, Mr. Rady, who told our Principal Miss Blake, and now I have to get my mom to come to school. - Oh, this is not good. This isn't even related to good. - Never been in trouble before, never. - I got it, I got it. Just don't tell your mom anything. - Now Principal Blake says I have to get my mom to come tomorrow at school at noon, otherwise I'll be suspended. - Well there you go, being suspended is like, well, it's like being on vacation. - No. - No? - Hey, hey, hey, how about if your granddaddy goes to school instead of your mommy? - My granddaddy? - Yeah, your Granddaddy yeah. - Oh. - Oh, yes. - Oh no way, no way. No, you can't be serious. No, I can't be a granddaddy. - [Principal] This is your first time at our school, isn't it? - Yes, my work keeps me from doing this sort of stuff. - What type of work is that? - I was an, I am an accountant. - I looked into Mary Elizabeth's records and your name's not listed as a member of the family. Is it our mistake? - Oh no, no, she's my step granddaughter. My first wife and child died. - I'm terribly sorry. But now to the matter at hand. You see this type of behavior is inappropriate. Mary Elizabeth just can't be punching her classmates. - Oh, I promise, it'll never happen again. You can count on Elizabeth and me. - Excuse me, I'm so sorry that I'm late. - I'm in the middle of a meeting, who are you? - Well I'm Mary Elizabeth's mother, Shari Jackson. - Welcome, sit down. I was just talking with your father. Or is it your husband's father? - My who? [door thudding] I don't ever wanna see you around my daughter again, you got that? - Look, Lizbeth asked me to do this 'cause she thought you'd overreact to her getting in trouble and I'm afraid I gotta side with her. - Overreact? You are a dirty, stinky wino and if you ever come near my daughter again, I'll call the cops. [somber music] You are a dirty, stinky wino. ♪ Sweet as honey on the band You know, you have very nice hair. Very manageable. I wish I had hair like this. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, are you sure you know what you're doing? - I told you my daddy was a barber. [laughs] - Well, you-- - Quit fidgeting. I'll cut off your ear and feed it to Mugsey. - [Briefcase] What? - [Muskat] My daddy used to say that to kids when they fidgeted. Mugsey was our bulldog. - Oh, thanks for that lovely trip down memory lane. [broom whooshing] Excuse me. - [Clerk] I don't give handouts. - I wasn't looking for one today, I notice you have a help wanted sign in your window. - I've had to ask you to leave this area before, do you remember? - No, sir, I sure don't. - [Clerk] You accosted my customers as they entered and exited my store. Drunk out of your mind you were. - I am, I'm sorry about that. - And now you're looking for work? - Yes, sir, yes, I am. - [Clerk] And you've decided to stop drinking? - Well, during work hours at least. - I won't use anyone who's drunk. I won't abide it. - I understand. - I pay minimum wage off the books. I don't need you full time, only part time. You get paid for hours you work only. You get paid on Fridays only. No advances, ever. How's that sound? - That sounds great. - When you're finished here I have some boxes that need throwing out and some crates that need throwing away. - Yes sir, I'll get right on it, sir. Thank you, sir, I won't let you down. [bright music] [traffic whooshing] - Man, this junk is heavy. - This is not junk, Muskat, this is the shattered remnants of my life and I'll ask you to show some respect. - Exactly why are we doing this? - 'Cause I don't wanna die in the gutter. - What's wrong with the gutter. - [scoffs] All right if you look at it a different way, it's a surprise. - Yeah you better be surprising me with a beer soon. Cold too. - [Briefcase] Oh just come on, come on. - I'm coming I'm just telling ya. You know. - [Briefcase] Oh you're worse than an old woman. - Well this old woman wants a beer. [upbeat music] [both coughing] Man, what is that smell? - Disinfectant. [sniffs] [Briefcase coughs] What, that's working. [Muskat laughing] - You pay extra for the view? - It was either that or some fat guy aerobicizing all day. [Muskat chuckles] - Man, oh man. [laughs] So, this is your place. - Yeah. [both laughing] What? - You gotta place! - I got a place. [both laughing] [gentle music] Hey girls, I got ya a new frame. Yeah. Got my own place now. Clean everything up, got a job too, did you know that? Yeah. Working at a grocery store. That looks great. Put you right here. Right there, huh. What do you think? Pretty nice place, huh? I'll fix it up, I'll fix up. There's my girls. Yep, job, new place. Sure miss ya though. How's school going? You haven't punched anybody in the nose again have ya? - Whatever. - Oh okay, how about this? If you bring home a straight A report card. - [Lizbeth] What's a straight A? - It's a grade. It's the highest grade you can get. - It's not our highest grade. - Well what's your highest grade? - An exceeds expectations. - Exceeds expectations? That's the silliest thing I ever heard of. Okay, okay fine. If you bring home an all exceeds expectations, I will take you camping. - Really, cross your heart and hope to die? - Yeah, cross my heart and, yeah. So, you sure your mom's not gonna come looking for you tonight? - No. - [Briefcase] What, is she staying over at Cyril's? - No, she's using the word processor at work. 'Cause the IRS sent us a letter wanting money from us and she thinks they're all full of crap. - You know, you shouldn't talk like that. - To who? - To me. 'Cause it's not nice. So your mom has tax problems huh? - Yeah. - [Briefcase] I can fix that. [doorbell buzzing] - [Shari] Yes. - Hi, Briefcase. - Hey. - You. What are you doing here? - Charles Herschler, ma'am, accountant. - For what, the trees in the park? - Well, before I came to your attention as a bum, I was a CPA for 13 years. - Look, I told-- - Elizabeth tells me that you're being asked to pay money that you don't think you owe. - Elizabeth. - [Briefcase] What, no, no, no, it's not her fault. - I know it's not her fault. And why are you still here? - I'm just trying to help. - Who asked you? I'm gonna call the police. - Look, lady. You're being stubborn. You have a tax problem and I'm telling you, I can solve it. All right, or, or perhaps I'm just blocking your door from all the tax accountants that are rushing to help you. Ha, no, no, don't see anybody, just me. - [Shari] I'm gonna call the police. - Look, I can help ya, so what do you got to lose? - Please, Mommy, he can do it. [gentle music] Please, Mommy. Please, please, Mom. - Okay. - Yes. - Okay. You guys hold hands on your way to school okay. - Bye. - Bye. - I'll be by to pick you up after. - Bye Briefcase. - Bye, bye, Michael. - [Shari] Would you like something to drink? I mean, coffee. - Yeah, sure, I'd love some. When did they come to you with this? - I don't know, like six months ago. - What have you been doing since then? What I meant was, usually people like to get this stuff over with. - I work full time and I kept putting it off because the people there made me feel stupid when I called. - Well, they are a bunch of self important jerks. At least I know I was. [chuckles] - So why did you quit accounting? - I need to look at this. You know, it seems they sent you a bill based on the interest income and yeah, then they charged you double for it. But you know, that's okay, as long as you paid the original interest income, we can just get a statement from the bank. - I mean I paid it, it's just that that savings and loan has gone out of business. - Okay, well then we'll just file a 604B and a 5204 addendum and I'll type up a piece of paper explaining all that. - And you know how to do all of that? - Sure, there's a guy in my building with a typewriter, so I'll work on it this weekend and then on Monday I'll go with you to the IRS office. You know, it's best to take care of these things in person before they snowball. - Why would you do that? - Because Elizabeth's my friend. - [Cyril] How you doin' today, Briefcase? - I'm sorry, young man. Do I know you? - I think you know who I am, old man. Shari just called me and was all excited about her new fairy godfather, Briefcase the wino. Lizbeth was real excited too. - You don't say. - You disrespecting me? Book I read on leadership says I gotta come down on that, hard. Or the disrespect might spread to my other employees. - Hey, Cyril, Sebastian. How are you both doing? - Preacher, isn't it a little dangerous to be walking in this neighborhood? - Nah, there's a couple of narkies down there on the corner sniffling around trying to bust somebody so things are pretty safe right now. - [Briefcase] Bye, Sebastian. - Hey you know-- - No, no, no talking, no preaching, thanks. I gotta go, I gotta go. - That was so easy. - Well the trick is to speak their language and to go in before lunch. If they think they're gonna miss lunch, they become very helpful. - I'm almost embarrassed to mention this but I promised Mary Elizabeth. - Oh did Elizabeth get her report card? And did she get all exceeds expectations? - Yeah. She told me that you wanted to take us camping. - Yeah, I'd like that. - Why? - Well it'd be nice to get out of the city for a few days, don't you think? And there's something about Elizabeth. The way she asks me questions all the time and the way she makes me smile, kinda reminds me of... I know, I know it sounds kind of weird if you look at it the wrong way, but it's nothing like that, I swear. - I wasn't thinking that. - Yes, you were. - Okay well I wasn't thinking that for the last couple of days. I mean, since I've gotten to know you a little bit better. - That's a start. So let me take you camping, it'll be fun. I know this really nice place. I haven't been there in a long, long time, but, so what do you say? [doorbell buzzing] Hey it's camping day. Wait 'til you see what I've put together. We can spend forever underneath those stars. - I can't go. - What do you mean you can't go? - She means she can't go, old man. She has more important things to do tomorrow, don't you, Lizbeth? - But I've been planning this. - You've been planning what? - [Briefcase] Well, Lizbeth, I mean, she wanted I, I-- - She's just a kid. She doesn't know what she wants or what's good for her. - I guess you're right. - Cyril, your dinner's ready. - Dinner, okay. - I'm so sorry, Briefcase. Mary Elizabeth really wants to-- - You're letting her run an errand for him? - I have to. Okay, he'll, nevermind. - Do you wanna go camping today? Because if you really wanna go, you can tell that, you can tell him that you have to run an errand. Right, both you and Lizbeth and I'll meet you on the corner, but Shari only if you really wanna go, 'cause I don't wanna cause anymore trouble for you and Elizabeth. - [Cyril] Shari, will you get up here. - Okay. Okay, I'll meet you around the corner okay? Okay. [upbeat music] [engine puttering] - Come on. - [Shari] Hurry up, go, go, go! - Inside, here we go. Up you go, up you go. Go, go, go! [truck engine revving] [upbeat music] ♪ Da, da, da, da, duh, da, da ♪ Duh, da, da, da, da, da, duh, da ♪ ♪ Da, da, da, da, da, duh, da ♪ Duh, duh, da, da, da, da, da, da ♪ ♪ Da, da, da, da [man scatting] - [Lizbeth] We're here, we're here. - Told you we were going camping. Now you guys sit down, sit down, sit down, I'm gonna fix everything up, just sit down and watch, here we go. Oh yeah, look at this we got warm blankets, warm blankets, pillows and lemonade. Look at this, this is just food. Look at all that food, and I'm gonna put the tent right here. And then I'm gonna, well I forgot the rope. I can't, I can't put the tent up without the rope. I've forgotten it. I've forgotten it all. - [Shari] Why don't we help while you rest? - Yeah we wanna try, let us, please. - Oh I should have got a better tent. Maybe we should just go back. - No, we don't need a tent. We could sleep outside, it won't hurt us. - Sure, why not, I mean it's a nice night. We can just put the tent out on the ground, and sleep on it that way we don't have to worry about the snakes and the bugs. - Yeah. - You really wanna stay? - Mm-hmm. - Like you said, it would be nice to get out of the city for a few days. - Okay, then. Let's set up camp, we'll stay. - [Girls] Yes. - I need some help. - Help up. - Oh, gosh. [girls groaning] ♪ Da, da, da, da ♪ Da, da, da, da - [Briefcase] Having a good time? - [Shari] Yeah this is so nice. - [laughs] You seem surprised. - [sighs] Maybe I'm just not used to nice. - Yeah, you can say that again. I'm sorry, I'm not talking about Cyril. - Cyril is a big baby, okay. Unless you owe him money, you have nothing to worry about. - How can you allow him to be in the same house as Elizabeth? - When I was young I did some things that I'm not proud of. But then I had Mary Elizabeth and I turned myself around. I mean, I went back to junior college and I got a job. Cyril helped me out then. I owe him. But he knows about my past and he threatens to tell Mary Elizabeth every single time that he gets mad at me. But only when he's mad. - He uses Lizbeth to make drug runs. - Look, I try my best. Do you want me to say it? I'm a bad person, okay. I'm a bad mom. - I'm not saying that. Honest, I mean no one has a right to tell somebody how to run their life, it's me, I mean, what am I, I'm a drunk who pretends to be the tooth fairy. [laughs] I'm not trying to make you feel bad, Shari. Heck, I'm just thankful to know you and Lizbeth. - [Lizbeth] Mommy, Briefcase, come help me find some crickets. - [chuckles] Should, you wanna go get some crickets with us? - No, nah, I'm exhausted. I'm gonna have another marshmallow. [both laughing] You go. [gentle music] [skateboard whirring] - That is one shifty looking kid. - He was all I could find. By the way do-- - No one has seen him, or Shari or Lizbeth. This isn't gonna turn out well. - Positive attitude, positive result, so shut up. Be cool, be cool. Jeez, who just ratted on me? Who? - Oh, come on now. - There's a million kids out on the streets, why are the cops picking on me? [dramatic music] [gentle music] - Well, looks like we made it. [laughs] - [Shari] Home sweet home. - Yeah. - I was wrong about you, Charles. I'm sorry. - That's okay. - So, what are you doing after this? - Well, I gotta get the truck back like I promised. You know, do the responsible thing. And then I guess I'll just go home. Hm, home, haven't said that to anybody in a long time. Sounds pretty good. - I meant what are you doing after this. - I'm just taking it one day at a time. That's all I can do. - If anybody deserves a second chance, Charles, it's you. - Jeez, here. - Hey kiddo. [groans] So, would you like to come in for some coffee? - No, you know, I better get going, ya know. Matter of fact it's probably a good idea if I don't show up around here for a couple of weeks. - How was camping? - Listen, Cyril. [groans] - Don't speak out of turn, Briefcase. It's rude. You are a piece of work. There are drunks out there but you're the whole package. And the name, that's great too. - I'm glad you approve. - It all stopped when you started costing me money. - [Shari] Cyril, stop it. - Will you shut up, you wanna wake up your little girl? This is gonna be a lesson, Briefcase, that you will never forget. - I can make it so the cops never bust you guys again. - [Cyril] What are you talking about? - All those winos out there, they're not all winos. Some of them are undercover cops. And they've been watching you. I mean, you probably can't tell the difference, but I can. - And I suppose you don't want me to use Lizbeth to make deliveries? - I can take her place. So I have a weak spot, shoot me. [Cyril chuckles] [both laughing] [police sirens blaring] - On a scale of one to 10, this is the stupidest-- - Sh, watch. - Are you gonna trust that fool? - Of course not, but I'm gonna use him though. Perfect. - What's the matter with you, thought you said you wanted a drink? - Taken all the fun out of it for me. - Taken all the fun out of it for me. - You know Briefcase, you were kinda impressing me for a while, you know. Cleaning yourself up, getting that place and all. What happened to your job at the grocery store? - Fired. It was idiot work anyway. - Yeah, but you was doing it. - I was throwing rotten produce in the garbage. Big bucks, look out Donald Trump. - Talked to Lizbeth yesterday. - She didn't lose another tooth, did she? Boy, that come back and bite me in the butt. - She misses you, Briefcase. - She'll get over it. Kids they bounce back. - Briefcase, what the is the matter with you? You were almost there. I mean, yeah you still drank, but not like before. Not like now. Why you wanna throw it all away? - I decided I was too old for change. Maybe I didn't wanna change, you ever think about that? You, you just remember, no more tips to the cops. Or Cyril and his goons are gonna pound on me again. - You gonna end up in jail or dead. Is that what you want? - Who cares? - [Muskat] Cyril ain't worth this man, he ain't. Yeah. [door thudding] [Briefcase yelling] - Is that any way to greet your guests? - What do you want? - What a dump. - With a capital D. - [Cyril] You been crying, Briefcase? - No. - I can be real sympathetic when I need to be. Makes people work harder for me. That's what it says in the books I read anyway. - Get to the point, Cyril. Just tell me when and where. - You see, all business. All right, tomorrow you pick up from me but you drop off to 707 Placer Street, entrance in the alley. - That's not the usual way. [body thudding] [Briefcase groaning] - Don't you worry about what's usual and what isn't. [chuckles] I just want to spice things up for you. Wouldn't want you to get in a rut. - You're too good to me. [blow thuds] [Briefcase groaning] - [Cyril] And after the delivery you come back to my place with the package, and I'll give you a $100 bonus, old man. [suspenseful music] [mysterious music] [brakes screeching] [Briefcase gasping] [door squeaking] [door thudding] - Oh. Hi. You know even the stuff they use on television wouldn't work on this. You would think that cleanliness is easier than godliness, but not when you're dealing with this junk. - I couldn't think of anyplace else to go. So I came here. - Oh well listen, I'll leave and let you pray in peace. - Oh no, no, actually, actually I was hoping to talk to you. You being the only clergy I know. - Whoa now this is beginning to sound like a lost sheep. Here, sit down, take a load off. - I've been blaming God for the bad things that have happened in my life and I've hated Him. And now-- - And now you need His help? - I was hoping He could do me a favor. Maybe help me do something that I don't have the strength to do it by myself. - You know what I've discovered, Briefcase? God is not a slot machine. You don't just put a quarter in and hope for lucky sevens to come out. - I know that Preacher, I, [gentle music] I guess what I'm asking is, do you think maybe, maybe a guy like me could get a second chance? - I was a doctor once, Briefcase, believe it or not. - So that's why the clinic. - Yep. I performed miracles, I brought people back to life. These people for any reason, science, they should have been dead. But I didn't think that I was God's vessel. I thought I was God. What a prideful I was. Anyway, my ego made me think that I was not addicted to these drugs that I prescribed. It would be a problem for a lessor person, but not for me, not for God. Anyway that attitude killed somebody. They made me stop doing what I loved more than anything else forever. I was out on the streets too, Briefcase. But then one day, I heard Him call. He forgave me. What do you say, Charles? Do you wanna be forgiven? - You haven't lost your touch there, Preacher. [gentle music] Hey you, you know there's no loitering round these parts. - Hey, hey, hey, look who it is, hey, Briefcase. - You drinking water? - Oh well you know, thought I'd, time for a little change. Enjoy the day for a while. - [Briefcase] But paying for bottled water? - Oh get real, I found this bottle a week ago, been refilling it ever since. [both chuckling] - So how you been doing? - Saved up $48, thought I might get me a place when I get enough. - Slow going though, huh? - You know it is. Tough keeping money saved. - Unless you have a whole bunch of it. - Well that would be a different story. But the lottery, that like a tax for the stupid. - No, no, no, you'd have a sure thing. - Oh, a sure thing sure would be nice. What exactly are we talking about here, Briefcase? - Oh, just talking about getting out of this city, you know, both of us. - Me and you? - Mm-hmm. - Mm, by ripping off Cyril? No, no, no, no, my momma didn't raise no fool, he'd kill us. - Don't you think I know that? Look, I gotta make a pick up this evening and well all the signs are pointing to it being, being really big. - What's so big about both of us getting a bullet in our head? - Well there are risks involved, there always is Muskat. Look, all right if you don't wanna help me with this, that's fine, you know, I mean I'll respect that. Can you honestly tell me that anything is gonna change with $48 in your pocket? And if everything goes the way I think it should, Cyril won't even know what we did until we're all gone. You, me, Elizabeth and her mother. - You got them helping? - No, no, no, no. I don't want them involved at all. I don't want them to know anything about it unless it all goes right. We're talking about 40 or $50,000 here. - How do you know that? - I just do. I'll call it all off if it goes wrong, but I can't do this alone. I need you on that phone. I need you watching Cyril and I need you to get Elizabeth and her mom away if everything goes smooth. - What if it don't go right? - I don't know. Muskat, it's like someone just told me. You just gotta have faith. [gentle music] - Okay. - Okay? - Okay, I'm in. - You're in? Yeah, yeah. [both laughing] - Yeah. [both grunting] - [Salesman] It's almost new. - Hi, how much is this? - That ones, well I can let you have that one for about $15. - $10. - You've gotta be joking, $10. - Come on, $10. - Like 12, 12, 12. - 10 bucks, 10 bucks. - Okay, okay, okay. - What are you doing, leave the phone alone, go, go, go. Jeez. [basketball thudding] - [Player] Where are you going old man? [fist banging] - The man of the hour is here. You ready? - Ready as I'll ever be. - This will be waiting for you when you come back. - I'll be back in a jiffy. Sebastian. - [Cyril] You like Briefcase? - Sure don't. - When he comes back, he's all yours. [Sebastian chuckles] [phone ringing] - Muskat here. - Stay loose Muskat, breathe. - I'm breathing, I'm breathing. - All right look, there's a phone by the exchange place, I'll call you when I get the cash. - All right I'll be there, no, I'll be here, I'll be here.

He's got two guys at Shari's door. He's coming for you I know it. Now you gotta get out of there. - Where, where at Shari's? - [Muskat] What do you mean, what do you mean? - Where, where are they standing? - They're at the front door, I told you, what difference does that make? - Where's Elizabeth, where's Shari? - They got them there too, Briefcase, now just call it off, call it off now. - No. No, no, no, we're never gonna get another chance.
