Mr. chan? This is miss ha from premier leisure tours. I booked the hotel and hot spring hotel for you. After your meetings, you can go to karuizawa on the third day. It's about an hour's drive from Tokyo. Will Mrs. chan accompany you? Or go directly to karuizawa on her own? I can book her a car. I'm going with my secretary. Then I'll need miss yeung's full name and passport number. Once the tickets are issued, I'll whatsapp you and miss yeung. Don't let my wife know. Tickets will be issued separately. No email, right? Yes. I understand. Bye! Miss, I'm calling from datong bank. Do you have trouble with your cash flow? Sure! Loan me $100m. Hello, miss! We're a professional beauty salon. We'd like to offer you a $799 slimming treatment. Are you free this week? That's great... I have tried many treatments, and I still weigh 300 pounds. This is manling's gift department... This is manling's gift department... No, thanks. Bye! Miss? Your father's in the hospital! Really? Save it for grave-sweeping! Miss, we're at Victoria hospital! Get over here now! Cross the harbour. I'll pay extra. Extra! Cross the harbour. Via western harbour tunnel. - Via western harbour. - Not crossing the harbour. Cross the harbour. Victoria hospital. Take the western harbour tunnel. How is he? Say something! How is he? He's gone. Over here! And you are... I'm his daughter. Please confirm his english name. H-a I-e-u-n-g date of birth? March 6. What year? Hold on... March 6, 1953. This is the medical certificate of the cause of death, and here's the cremation form. Please double check the particulars. Okay, thank you. You're the second person I've met to use that much chili sauce. Who's the first? Are you uncle leung's daughter? He spoke of you. You know my dad? He was admitted for a few days last year. He grumbled about the lousy food and put chili sauce on everything. Just like you. He even complained it wasn't spicy enough! Compare to his fagara hotpot, it's way too mild. After he left the hospital, he invited me to his restaurant for a few times. Speaking of which, it's been a while since I last saw him. How is he? He just passed away. What? I'm sorry. It's too sudden. Are you ok? Do I look like I'm not? Precisely! That's why you're not alright! I'm fine, thanks. Miss. Uncle leung left this. Battery is dead. You can charge it by the cash register. Thank you. Uncle leung said we needed to pay wing kee and other suppliers. Even if he's not around, we must pay them on time. I only know how to place simple orders. He managed the books. I'll need your help with that as well, miss. Stop calling me "miss." It's not cool. Yes, miss. Uncle leung said you didn't like to be called by your name. "Cherry: Dad! It's freezing in Chongqing! Are you ok in hk?" "Branch: Dad, want to see me compete in Taiwan?" "Owner away. Closed till further notice." "Thank you for understanding." "Family hotpot" Where's daddy? He's gone. Taiwan. Daddy... Doesn't love us anymore. Wipe your mouth. Quit your Mr. nice guy act. Drink some water... Go back to Taiwan. Go back to that woman... "Leung: Ha leung's funeral, 6p.M. On feb 27, 2018." "Room 201, Hong Kong funeral home." "Leung: Ha leung's funeral, 6p.M. On feb 27, 2018." "Room 201, Hong Kong funeral home." "A love so vast and great." "To my beloved father," "daughter acacia, branch, cherry" pardon me... Mr. ha had two other daughters? Are they coming? Do they need mourning clothes? This was never discussed. Now we don't have time to prepare. But if you really need it... For a little extra, we can still arrange it. I believe he'd like to see them do their duties... He'll know... We'll decide when they arrive. Just let me know. - I'll make the arrangements. - Thank you. Radish, I'll be in the ladies' room. No need for that. Please come forward. Please stay. Bow... Again... And again. Family acknowledgement. Yes, I'm in Hong Kong. You always wanted him dead, right? Now that he's dead, why can't I see him one last time? Please stay. Bow... Again... And again. Sorry, I'm late. But... What? Your father was a Buddhist. A Buddhist? Yes. Dad was a Buddhist? Yes! Why didn't anyone tell me? I just found out when I got here. You were half way through the ceremony. I couldn't possibly say he was a Buddhist. Don't worry. He won't mind. It's the thought that counts. Have a seat. I'll step out for a bit. Ok! What were they saying? Something about dad being a Buddhist. - My condolences. - Take care. Thank you. I don't think dad would mind. You must call out to your father to accept these. Call him as you naturally would. Come and get them, dad! These are for you, dad! Put them away, dad! Come and get them, dad! You guys must be tired. Go shower! I'm fine. You must be beat. I'm ok. Go ahead. It's ok. You go first. Ok, I'll go. Where's the bathroom? Yong? I put out the dishes like you said, including his favorite glass. Send him a picture. I'll send you a picture and you can double check, ok? Ok... thank you! Bye! Hey! These are for dad! Just a bite. Dad won't mind. You're hungry? I'll fix you something... don't eat those. I just wanted to taste them. How else do you know if this is what he likes? I picked these arbitrarily. There's actually not much he didn't like. What's wrong? No hot water! It's a storage type water heater. There should be enough for two. Was I taking too long just now? Quit yakking! What now? Just wait. What the hell are you looking at? You have them too! When I saw him again, it was at my college graduation. He must have begged my mom to let him show up. He just watched me from afar. It was after that when I got to know him. Lucky you! At least he was there! I did my degree in Canada. Back then when my mom took me there, I thought I'd have a new family. But in the end I found out she told people I was her niece, not her daughter. No one came to my graduation. Dad didn't know? Of course he did. But he was too busy at the shop. He could not come. When did he get hooked on this? Must be the babes. Just look at that outfit and that angle! Ah!! You're truly awesome! Don't watch it. Why not? Isn't your name "branch" with an "r"? Why did they use "blanche" with an "I"? No one in Taiwan would name a child like that. It's corny, so I changed it. Au yeung is a cool last name! You are a full-time professional athlete? Most people consider it entertainment and not a sport. When dad watched it, people would say he did it for the babes. No... I was just kidding. Dad was not that kind of guy. Sis! Let's take a picture together. Radish. - Can you help? - Oh, alright. Use this as the background. Come on. - Move closer. - Okay. Move back a little. Ready? One, two, three. Which soup base do you want? What would you like to eat? I'm not picky. Anything's fine. We must try dad's signature fagara hotpot. We use this soup base, plus pork bone, duck blood jelly, tofu... It's a lot of work! What's the difference between green and red? It's green and red, that's it. Red is sichuan peppercorn; green is sichuan green pepper. Red is more fragrant, and green is more numbing. That's what I mean! Let's add both! Add whatever you like! There's food in the fridge... I'm not sure if it's still fresh! We have not stocked up. Have fun. I'm leaving. Haven't had hotpot for a while! Me too! The last time was with dad, right here. But this is my first time in the kitchen. You've been here before? A few times! But never ran into you. Dad said you're seldom home. This is my first time here. You suppose because dad loved hotpot so much, that's why he opened this shop? He used to be a Chinese chef. He quit suddenly and started a business in Taiwan. He came back when my mom got sick and he wanted to open a hotpot shop. Really? My mom hates hotpot. Maybe it's because of him. I don't know either. He never mentioned what he did all those years in Taiwan. Mom said they were each other's first love. Dad followed grandpa and the whole family to Taiwan. After grandpa died, his wives fought over his estate. Dad hated it and came back to Hong Kong alone. Maybe things didn't work out for him, so he went back to Taiwan and met my mom again. Then they had me. So dad met your mom first and married my mom later? Probably. In that case, who's "the other woman"? Beats me. Depends on how you define "the other woman." The one he met first or the one he married first? It's not a competition to see who gets first serve. The key is who he ended up with. The key is... Regardless of the choice he made, he hurt us all. No. Their choices didn't hurt me at all. Because... I was never anyone's choice. Come on... Let's take a picture! Over here! 3... 2... 1... It kind of feels like when I used to buy clothes for my customers, they are invoiced goods from the same source, same cut, same material. But without the label, it's not an original. That's why I must have my own brand. Let's take another one... The last one was no good. Our faces were distorted. - Here? - Yes, this button. Is it ok? It's blurred! - Just focus! - Miss! Just leave the dishes in the sink. I'll clean up tomorrow! I'll get out of your way. Bye! This may be our last hotpot in here. What? It's only my first time! You're not taking over? I don't know. I can't afford the rent and I know nothing about hotpot. But dad worked hard for this place. It'll be such a shame. He brought it upon himself. Huh? What? Nothing... let's eat! We should start a group chat. What should we call it? Cockroach!! What? Cockroach!! Wait! Don't kill it. It might be dad!! Haven't you heard? The spirit of the dead may return as an insect. Just don't kill it! Why not a moth!? Why a cockroach!! It's ok for a cockroach, but why do you have to fly? We're off, sis! Take care. You too. Bye! See you! Bye! Bon voyage! I'm sorry... I couldn't get back in time when your dad died. I was afraid you wouldn't be able to accept it. I didn't expect you to tell them. You seem to get along rather well. You knew my dad had other daughters? He told me. I used to visit him when I went to tai hang. He told me. He told you, but not me! Why didn't he let us meet sooner? Was he afraid we wouldn't get along? He can't even get along with you! How hard is it for you to have dinner in tai hang? How could he tell you when he couldn't even see you? The point is, he never said anything! Not about my sisters, not about his illness. Men are straightforward. They won't bring up a subject unless you ask. You may not want to hear what they have to say. How could I ask him when I didn't even know? Are you saying it's my fault? No, I just can't find the words you want to hear. See! You're at it again. All I wanted was to take you out for a bite. Look what happened! What should we eat tonight? Japanese? I can. You can? But do you want it? Not particularly, but I can go with you. Do you want Japanese? Or you can just eat it? Is there a difference? Is it possible you don't particularly want to get married, but you can do it. Actually, do you want to get married? I can... Sometimes, I don't tell you things because I'm afraid you'll get the wrong idea. Try not to agonize over whether or not your dad told you anything. Try to figure out why he chose not to tell you. Sir, you can't smoke in here. Sorry, doc! Follow me. It's up ahead. It's a long way to have a smoke! It's better to let people know than to let them see! People come and go in a hospital. It's best not to be seen. Why are you here alone? Why didn't your family come with you? It's just a checkup. My daughter's very busy. I don't want to waste her time. What are you in for? Vascular occlusion, hypertension, gout, and something in my eye... Called macular degeneration. Your typical geriatric illnesses. The meds are making me dizzy. That's quite a lot. Over the hill with cranky parts... It means I'm old. Can you fix old age, doc? Old age is not an illness... In fact, you don't need meds for most illnesses. Oh? This is the first time I hear a doctor say that... What's your specialty? Anesthesiology. An anesthetist! Actually, I'm also a doctor! In Hong Kong, people tend to think anesthetists are not doctors. Sorry, I didn't know either. You know... Hongkongers can be quite shallow. That's true. That's why I want to leave. And go where? Syria. It's a mess over there. Do you have a wife and kids? Me? Just got a divorce. Anyone outside this field can't cope with my hours. I can see that you're under a lot of pressure. That's why I want to go somewhere I don't work just to make a living, but where I'm truly needed. What's stopping you? I know I can't. But you're young and divorced. If you want something, go for it! The rain has stopped. Let's go back. Ok. Do you like hotpot? My hotpot restaurant is in tai hang. He reminded me if I really wanted to do something, I should stop making excuses. Don't listen to him. He doesn't practice what he preaches. Everyone... What was his reason for not telling me he was sick? He said you're busy and didn't want to bother you. If he had told me, I would have taken him to see a doctor. Sometimes it's not about finding a cure. As you get older, sickness may be harder to notice, but old-age, you can definitely see. Miss ha, this is Mr. chan. Take a good look, Mr. chan. It's nicely renovated and well-equipped. You can open for business right away. Knock down this wall. I want an open kitchen. Ok! What does he know? Open kitchen? What about the fumes? They use ready-made ingredients for the soup base. There's no need to stir-fry. I'll change the menu to all-you-can-eat. And I want to keep the logo. What? You want to buy their logo? Let me try... Miss ha, everything's ok in general, but... Mr. chan is interested in your logo. Can he keep it? That's not what we discussed! We agreed to change the name. Yes... He's clueless about the kitchen, he doesn't care about hotpot. He'll probably use additives for taste and wreck our reputation. Miss ha, don't worry! With an interested buyer, it's better than closing the shop and pay the landlord, right? If you take over, you must pay these losers... workers. I feel bad for you. While the logo is still worth something, I'll get you a good deal! The money is yours only when it's in your pocket! Let me handle this! Trust me! Miss, don't sell! This logo is uncle leung's blood, sweat and tears. He always said it didn't matter if we made money or not, as long as we tried hard enough. We are not afraid of hard work! Yes! We can handle this! This is an established brand. We're veterans, and we really can't bear to lose it. Name your price! It's really not about money. Which means there's no problem! Thank you, miss ha! I have decided to take over! Go for it! Mr. chan, I'll show you another shop. You can renovate any way you want. Sis. What's this? Sis gave it to me. She's not petty like you! Tell your sis to come down for dinner! Sis! Mom wants you to come down for dinner! - What? - Leave me alone. It's mine. Mine! She bought it for me. We're having dinner soon! Don't snack! Branch... have a seat. Sis, sit by me. It's not every day branch stays for dinner. Let's eat! Come... have a seat. Were you in Hong Kong for a tournament? No, just to look around. What did you see? Hey, let your sister enjoy her meal. And you! The phone! What are you watching? Don't you know this game? Frog breeding! You help him pack a suitcase, and he'll go off on a holiday! - Really? - And he'll send postcards! Sis, just ignore her. It's stupid. All you do is wait and nothing else. You don't get it! No, it's adorable. Download this app, and we can play together. Ok! She doesn't need to. She's already a frog. Hop, hop, hop... and she's here. Hop, hop, hop... away she goes. At least the frog will send a postcard once in a while. What did she bring back? She brought biscuits. Mommy, can that frog bring you trophies and medals? Branch will be competing in a few days. We can all watch her on TV! That's right! Tournaments without cash prizes have the biggest trophies. Hop, hop, hop... I'll get the chili sauce. Let me do it. It's ok. I'll do it. - It's all right. - Let me... - It's ok! - Ti... - Yes? - Let her do it. She's never home. Ok! How was it? How was what? How was Hong Kong? If you wanted to know, why didn't you go? No reason. Fine, let's drop this. Your cousin is getting married in a few days. Will you go? If you're not afraid that I'll bring bad luck, then I can go. It was my father that was gone, not your husband. Yes, your father was gone, but don't forget who raised you. Mei-meil I'm off! Your hat! Thanks! Bye! Bye! Go in. Your mom's angry. Branch au yeung! Why are you here? Waiting for you! I didn't ask you to wait. I remember you're coming back today. You ignored all my text messages, so I came straight from work! I never said I would be meeting you. Just go home. No! Forget it! Branch au yeung! Branch au yeung! Open the door!! Branch au yeung! Open the door!! Hi, everyone! Welcome to cherry's live show! Today I'd like to recommend to you this gold jacket that I'm wearing. Take a look from the side, front and back of this beautiful outfit. The gold buttons are exquisite. Then pair it with tight pants which also have cool details. Let me see... someone just asked me how to choose the right size. Tell me your height and weight and I'll choose for you. This lovely jacket will be in your hands in no time! Did I go to Hong Kong to stock up? No, I went there for a personal reason. But this... is a brand new item! Cherry, I saw on your blog... That outfit you wore to the funeral. Wasn't it too flashy? I see nothing wrong with that. I'm paying my last respect. I should wear something nice, right? My granddaughter is already 26! And still no boyfriend! Unlike your granddaughter, who's smart, makes good money, takes good care of you and herself. Smart? She's almost never home. Then why don't you find her a good match? I'm not getting anywhere with that. It'll be great if she marries a Canadian like your daughter! 9 characters. Pong! What's so great about that? She has the good life and I'm stuck with her daughter. Your daughter was clever. She didn't marry the hongkonger. Let's drop it. 7 circles. Game! I shouldn't have discarded that! Granny, if only your granddaughter didn't dye her hair, I might have a match for her. It's called fashion! - You know nothing. - Fashion? Aunties! Want some sweet soup? Yes! Thank you. Thank you. This is good stuff. 7 bamboos. - Here... - Thanks. Granny, take your pills. Later! No! Do it now! Hurry! I'll help you. 4 characters! Take your pills! Your back is achy, so don't play till late, ok? Don't nag! Get busy with something else. I'm busy taking care of you! I'm taking the melon seeds. Aunties, I'll get you fresh tea. Don't fuss! See? Your granddaughter is so sweet. I guess, if she got married, you would feel lonely. Let me clean the tiles. It's late, go to bed. Clean all sides, they're sticky! I know. Granny, it's way past new year. Why did you buy peach blossoms? To wish that you'll find true love! Fake peach blossoms will bring true love? Still up? Are you mad at me? No... I can't be bothered! I know... you're angry I went to Hong Kong. Don't be. He was the only father I had. Of course he was. And two sisters! See? You're so close. You're the only granny I have. I promise I'll always love you. You're my one and only, my beloved. Ok? Turn it off. No, I want to look some more. Look at the time. Time for bed. Atta girl! I'll charge up your phone and you can play with it tomorrow. Come on. Lie down. Snuggle up! Good night. Sleep tight! Lights out. More soup. Be careful! Beer. Thanks! Coming... Lobster balls! I didn't order this. Not here. Over there. Sorry! Beer. Thanks! - Lobster balls! - Your beer. More order! Be right with you! I didn't order luncheon meat. Ok. I'll double check. - Yes? - One more of this! - Right away! - Thank you. How can you go wrong with a list? Your dad always read me the order. You want me to read you everything? Fine! Beef Chuck, diced beef, chicken strips, fish skin, wonton, udon, squid balls. Hurry! The customer's chasing! Bean curd roll, shrimp paste, squid paste, razor clams, coral mussels, one each! Radish! Call wing kee tomorrow and order more beef! Mr. lam, did you drive? No. Beer's on me! Fish skin! Wake up! Go home. Leave this to me. Actually, I've never once finished the dishes before closing. The boss always did them for me. Miss, let's do that tomorrow. Hello? You're not in Hong Kong? I'm in england. I'll call you later then. It's ok. Go ahead! When you bought this flat, you paid a little over $1m. It's now close to $9m. Hong Kong property market is crazy. The price is $9m but it doesn't mean it's worth that much. I've been thinking why don't you sell it or rent it out? I paid you such low rent for years. You must be bleeding. Money isn't everything. I don't make a living from buying and selling property. If I didn't lower the rent, knowing you, you'd pay more elsewhere than move back in with your dad. The hotpot shop still has another year on the lease. There's a heavy penalty if I terminate early. I decided to move back home to save some money. Hello? Can I help you with anything? Don't take on the world. No thanks. I have troubled you long enough. Don't be a stranger! When are you moving? Call me. I'll give you a hand. I'm actually all packed and have called the movers. Just like that? You're moving out? I left your things untouched since you moved out. If you need anything, just come back and get it. I change the sheets once in a while too, in case you want to sleep over. By the way... Where's your new place after you got married? Kowloon. That's far. Bring tin-yan home for dinner sometime, ok? Sure... when I have time. There's really no rush for you to get married. Even if you don't, I can support you. Shouldn't you be happy for me? You'll be off the hook! I don't want these anymore, you can throw them out! But you've been saving them since grade school. Not anymore. They're useless. Try this. Is this anything like dad's signature soup base? - Careful! - It's hot! Smells great! Well? Too spicy? Very! Shall I add some broth? No, sit down and let's eat. Do you know spiciness is not a taste but a pain? You lost me. For instance, you have headaches? Been having a lot lately! When you have a headache... Give me your hand... Press this acupoint. Is your headache gone? Actually, I'm not sure if this acupoint is effective. But we can use another stimulant to divert attention and numb ourselves. Spicy food can be a form of pain to numb another pain. Want a beer? No thanks, I drove. Where did you park? Right outside. I was supposed to take my driving test but had to reschedule when dad passed away. When will you take it again? I don't know. I don't have time to practice. The dock is empty at night. It's pretty safe. Don't worry. Are you sure? Seriously... look! It's deserted. Please. Give it a go! Ready? Go! Look left, look right, adjust the mirror, put to drive mode, then... Release the brake! Release the brake. Let's go! Let's go! The car is not moving! You're stepping on the brake! Step on the gas. Easy... Watch it... Now I'm quite certain you're not meant to drive. I'm out of practice. Why do you want a license so bad? Someone once told me, with a driver's license we could travel together and take turns driving the car. Even without a license, we can still travel together. I can drive or we can take a bus or a train. There are other ways. I guess... if you have a license, you can drive anywhere you want. You must switch on the box. This one? How do you know what I want to watch? Uncle leung told me to get this installed. He didn't watch much TV, but when there was a tournament, he'd drop everything and be glued to that chair. Here's an excellent chance for blanche au yeung to break her own record. With a lackluster performance last year, she miraculously eliminated the no. 2 seeded luk siu-kuen yesterday. If she can take this match, she'll make it to the semis. Let's see if she can keep her superb form! Right now, they tie at 8 points. Next up is the deciding set. Blanche au yeung must stay focused or else she'll stop short of the final 8! Game ball! Cheng Mei-Mei wins the match with an extra frame! What a shame! Blanche au yeung missed the 8-ball and gave her opponent two clear shots. She lost her lead... And couldn't advance to the semis. Congratulations to Cheng Mei-Mei for getting into the semis. Her next opponent will be the superb Korean player, Kim ki-young. Branch... It's ok. You were awesome. Can I take a picture with you? Go for it... Go for it... All the best! Thank you! Why are you here? To root for you. It's all right, branch. I know you can do better next time! If you've worked hard in your own life, you wouldn't say it's alright. Branch! Ma, am! Come have dinner! Go ahead and eat! Don't wait! Boss! More soup. Coming! I'll get that... Start without me. How's everything? Great... Let it boil first... More order, boss! Coming! Thank you! Right away... Mr. ha! Cheers... Cheers... Thank you! - Great! To your booming business. - You too. Be right back! Extra order. Pork intestines. Beef balls. Throw in some tripes. You're working too hard. You should quit. Let's eat! - Where are you going? - I'm full! Acacia... You always want me back for dinner. Now that I'm here... Why can't we just have a proper meal together? - Let's eat. - Let's eat miss. Come on, miss. Thanks for your hard work. Eat, eat. "Looking for love" "Husband wanted" How is she? Granny's in her 80s, her bones are still quite strong! But at her age, don't let her wander around alone. Keep an eye on her. No eggs or seafood. Ok! Here. Go get the prescription. Thank you, doctor! Slow down, grandma! What did the doctor tell you? Don't run off on your own! And... don't go there again! What do you mean? You think I have nothing else better to do? What? That's not what I mean. Then what do you mean? Because you don't seem to want a boyfriend, I had to find one for you. Every time I set up a blind date, you'd dye your hair and put on some weird outfits. Look at that orange head of yours! No wonder you scare them off. You said it looked nice when I dyed it! Grandma, I know what I'm doing. Why are you so anxious when I'm not? If 1 got married, who'd look after you? I don't need you. Don't be so noble either. If only your mom would acknowledge you as her daughter, you could have stayed in Canada instead of run back here. If you like Hong Kong so much, you should have told your dad and moved out there! Then why didn't 1? Need you ask? Would your dad agree if you suggested it? Definitely not! If you could leave, you wouldn't be here taking care of an old lady. In this world, no one is indispensable. If you have a better place to be, go! I'd rather die than let you look after me! Over here. - A jug of sour plum juice. - Ok! Miss ha... What's taking the soup so long? Sorry. Let me check. Be right back! Where's the soup? Ask them to order something else. Why? We're out. Why didn't you say so earlier? We had some earlier... Make some now! I don't know how. Didn't you learn? Then I'll have to make it. Which means my dad made the soup? What can you actually do? Why did he even hire you? Exactly! I don't know either. We booked ahead for the fagara soup! I'm sorry! - I'm very sorry! - So sorry. Let me know once it's ready! It's my favorite! I'm so sorry... Do come again! I don't understand. Why did he hire people who couldn't help him? Francis used to be a division a soccer player. But after he injured his tailbone, uncle leung asked him to work here. I know... We're no help to uncle leung. He was the one helping us. Back then, I was fresh out of prison. Shut out by my own family, I couldn't find a job. Only your dad would take me in. I asked him why and he said, we all made mistakes. We're all waiting for that someone to forgive us. I finally found him, but he's gone. I'll go clean up. Miss branch, we're in deep shit! We ran out of soup base and Francis left. Can you help us? Hanging them like that, the clothes will never dry. You're awake? Don't mind me. Go back to sleep. You came in without knocking again? I have the key! Why should I knock and wake you up? Mom, don't fuss. I'll take care of it. If you can do it, why would I come all the way to help you? Every time I straightened things up, you messed them up in no time. I don't get it. We have plenty of room at home, yet you choose to live alone in this dump! I like living alone in this dump! Why can't I get that down? Mom! I told you never to touch that! Ok... I won't! You know it's not stable. Why bother hanging it here? When you first started playing, I thought you did it for fun. I didn't expect you to treat it like a job. Win or lose, it doesn't matter now. You have done great. It's not just a job. It's a career. You won't understand because you never had one. Yes, I don't understand! You want to play for the rest of your life? You've been doing this for over 10 years! It's about time you face reality! What reality? The fact that you have already lost! I mean... You win some, you lose some. You're very good already, but the prize money is not enough to feed you. I'm just afraid you'll suffer... All I wish... is for you to find a steady job. What are you doing? What are you doing? Go find a job! Branch! Miss! You're too old to run away from home. Depends on how you define "home." This is my home too! You're my family. What's wrong? Toothache! Don't bother to look! It's just an infection. I'll be fine. Fine? You're running a fever! Don't cook! My tooth hurts! I can't eat! I'm done! Let it sit and eat it later. I can't find the painkillers. Back when I had toothaches, dad would put peppercorn on my achy tooth. It'll go numb and the pain would stop. Want to try? No, thanks! Come on. Be a good girl! You're from Chongqing. You're used to peppercorn. But we don't eat it raw! No, I don't want it. You'll be fine. It's good! Branch, try this! No! Well? Is it good? We both ate it! Your turn... Come on... So numbing! The pain's gone! Really? - Miss hal! - Yes! The soup base tastes different. Really? Is it too spicy? Look, I'm not complaining... It's just different from uncle leung's version. Sichuan peppercorn. Check! Star anise. Minced garlic. Red onion and this. Check! I'm putting them in. Just half! Too much... Too much! Scoop it out, hurry! - Check the pork bone soup, sis! - Ok! Use both hands! Both hands. Both hands! Don't act so cool, for chrissake! Use both hands! Ok... Next you have to put... Sis, can you get it? I can't see! Let me help you... Better? No... Don't stop! Hurry up! But not quite. What's missing? Maybe I didn't do the right search? It's a secret recipe! You won't find it so easily. Silly girl! Shall we try "ancestral secret recipe"? Maybe there's a section on hotpot. Let's have breakfast. It's time for lunch. What day is it today? Acacia, daddy's going to work now. Be good and do your dictation. It's ok even if you got it wrong. Rewind the tape and redo it till you get it right. Anything? Nothing! Dad's notes are only newspaper clippings. How to combine shark's fin soup with hotpot. Cherry likes the peppery taste in shark's fin soup... Dad mentioned me! But it has nothing to do with the recipe. But he mentioned me! Did he mention me? Watch branch compete. December 8, chung ching cup. Nothing to do with the recipe either! Right! What if we can't find the secret recipe? There must be a way! Sleepy already? Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Is that dad? If it were him, we could ask him about the recipe! Good idea! Dad! What is in the secret recipe? Where is it? We're losing customers. What should we do? Dad, since you're here, I have a question. You've said it's important to be polite. I'm already very polite... But why do I still get bad reviews? It's so unfair! Right? Dad... You always said if I work a little harder. I'd play better. I have worked very hard, but it's not good enough... What should I do? What if I still lose? What if we have tried our best and the world remains unchanged, what can we do? For any business, if you don't have exclusivity, you must offer variety. Sis! The aprons are here. Try it on! Cherry! Do you have black? Just one color. Don't try to stand out! This is for you. How does it look? You drew that? No, from the web. I know you can manage without me. I just came to apologize. Francis! Of course we can do without you. Anyone can do without anyone else. But... If someone can help us in the kitchen, we certainly won't mind. Don't just stand there! Thanks, miss! Careful... hot soup... Fagara pot. - Branch, show them the table. - Ok! Two, please. W ait. Give me that pen. You have to return it. This way... Thanks. Enjoy! "I'm coming home, wait for me." Wait! This is table ♪3, and this is ♪9. Got it. Hello? Hello, branch? It's no big deal. Just want to know if you'll be home for dinner. I'm in Hong Kong. Hong Kong? Don't tell mom! Right... Branch, let's eat! I'll go shut the gate. Please step aside. This is the job you want? I'm just helping out. When will you go home? No idea. They need me. They need you? Where was he when we needed him? I raised you and gave you a proper home! By marrying someone you don't love? All because of me, right? How many times did you use that excuse? It's always about what you want, but never about what I want. What do you want? He did nothing. Did he give you anything? When everyone doubted me and told me to quit, he was the one who told me not to give up! Right... don't give up! Don't forget he didn't want you. It wasn't me he didn't want. It was you! This is my favorite booze. I know... The one he loved most... Was you. That doesn't matter anymore. The one I love most now is my daughter. Nothing is more important than her. If she's so important, then you should know what she wants. I do. I just don't know why. Whenever I get the chance to speak to her, I can never say the right thing. The words always come out wrong to piss her off. But I thought she'd understand. Precisely because you didn't tell her. That's why she doesn't understand. Talk to her, while you still can. I'll get the door. Careful! Careful! Here comes the signature soup! Radish, more soup! How many? We've walked a long way. Where exactly are we going? Miss. It's not too far as long as we can get there on foot. How do you define far then? Sometimes, it's actually not far geographically, but you feel it far psychologically. Around this time on the day after tomorrow, I should be in Syria. I used to feel that war is a faraway thing, knowing little from the media here and there. I remembered you said you wanted to go somewhere that needs you, and you'll go no matter how far it is. I'm not that noble! [T's not because I'm needed somewhere, more like, I want a place that needs me. Why are we here so early in the morning? Won't you take a walk with me? See those low rise over there? We used to live there. Back then, this river bank was not yet finished. I don't remember. Of course not. You were so little. I don't remember much either. People are like that. We remember the bad and forget the good. I'm that way. Are you tired? No! Are you? Not really. What's wrong? I'm sorry. Get me a tissue. No more. Take out that box. Oh. Open it. What's that? You don't remember? The youth cup! I was watching the whole time. You worked very hard. Me too. I'm learning to say the right things. Since then, you have been my no. 1. Thank you, mom. Grandma, remember when I was little, we'd ride this whenever you picked me up. Now it's a big tourist attraction. Mom remarried after she broke up with dad. You took me home from the other side of the lake. When she missed me, you'd send me back. I grew up getting tossed around. Looking back, that was rather scary. You were afraid of heights back then. Now that you're all grown up, you're not scared to go anywhere, right? It's now my turn to be scared. Scared to let you watch me age and feel bad. Then why try so hard to marry me off? Why shove me away? That's because I'm afraid you'll be all alone when I'm gone. No way! Why would I be alone? I will take very, very, very good care of you. When the day comes and you're sick of me and want to leave, I still won't be lonely. Because leaving this world is like moving to another apartment. You'll always live inside someone's heart. Understand? You can have it back. There's no rush. I didn't buy the place to rent it out. I'm saving it for you. Why are you so nice to me? My well-being is not your responsibility. Do you remember when I asked you to have dinner with your dad, you always said crossing the harbour was a hassle? As father and daughter, how hard is it to cross the harbour? Back when we were together, I promised your dad I'd look after you. Maybe I won't be with you forever. But at least I can take you across this tunnel. Why is it you're always talking about him? Do you know what scares me the most? I'm scared I'll be like my mom. She knew he loved someone else, and yet she made him stay. First of all, I'm not your dad. Secondly, if mom didn't get sick, would he come back? He just didn't want to be the bad guy. If he could choose not to love us, he would have done it. What you just said... In other words, he must have loved you as he didn't choose not to. I don't get it. If you don't want to get it, nothing I say will help. He didn't stay because of responsibility. He wanted the responsibility because he loved you. You still don't get it? I thought I made it quite clear. I guess it's not something you want to hear. You want to hear "I want to be with you" and not "I can be with you," right? You finally know the difference! There's none! In the whole sentence, why must you agonize over "want" and "can" and totally ignore "be with you"? I mean, what matters is I'm with you. What time is it? It's ten o'clock. Good afternoon. The class starts at 9 o'clock. Good morning. I'm late for school. Let's have breakfast. It's time for lunch. What day is it today? Acacia, daddy's going to work now. Be good and do your dictation. It's ok even if you got it wrong. Rewind the tape and redo it till you get it right. Acacia, I'm sorry I didn't spend enough time with you. Thank you! Please come again. Bye! Crab sticks! Sis! Why didn't you tell me you're coming? We wanted to surprise you! What a surprise indeed! Let's eat! Happy mid-Autumn festival! Happy mid-Autumn festival! Eat some more! Thanks! Sis... It's crowded out there. What's going on? It's the fire dragon dance for mid-Autumn. It's the fire dragon dance. Let's go have a look! - Ok! - Let's go! - Let's go! - Come on! You two are not going? Sis, let's go have a look! Let's go! I have never seen it before. Hurry up! Let's take a picture! Uncle leung used to sign us up every year, forcing us to dance. Time flies. A year went by just like that. The lease is almost up. I know. Don't worry about us. Do whatever you want to do. Like uncle leung, as long as you're happy, we're happy. Come on, sis! Hurry up! I'm not mad at you anymore! I just want to tell you I missed you. I really missed you. I missed you, dad! "For rent"
