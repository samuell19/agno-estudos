[MUSIC PLAYING] GIRL (VOICEOVER): You know, this is an elite finishing school for wealthy young ladies. Yeah. Well for me, it was like being in prison. Six months ago, my mother told me, you'll just love it, darling. Oh, sure. I know now why she put me away in there. She wanted a divorce. And neither she nor my dear daddy wanted to get stuck with me. Well, damn it. They have their freedom now, and I'm going to have mine, too. They can't keep me locked away in there. I'm going to really live it up. Six months in that hole with those poopy pious nuns wild. They thought I was dumb just because I hate school, well except for sex education. And what a joke that was. Every girl in that school knew more about sex the day after they were born than those stupid nuns will ever learn. My mother told me they turn me into a perfect young lady. Well, they turned me into a frustrated young bitch. What I need now is a real man, and I know exactly what to do with him. Boy, if my mom knew what really happens inside that school. Oh god, who cares? I'm free, free at last. Hey? Hey, stop. What luck, they'll never catch me now. Hey, how about lift, mister? Sure. Where are you going? Any place you want to take me. Thanks. Saved my life. Yeah? Is somebody's chasing you? What did you do? Are you from that finishing school? You're not dumb. I had to escape from that pukey place. I know it's an expensive school. Why didn't you like it there? How could you believe what happens there? It's really disgraceful. Every girl is hung up on sex. Is that so? I could tell you stories that would blow your mind. Go ahead. It would really shock you. It would take a lot to shock me, a traveling salesman. What do you sell? Ladies underwear. You're kidding. Who wears it? Some women wear underclothes. Yeah, I bet you don't wear any though. I'd like to show you my samples. Mm. They're really very sexy. Men like that. I don't believe that a guy would prefer a woman who wears a bra to one who doesn't. I believe in freedom from bondage. This way, I travel very light. You burned your bra? [LAUGHING] Bridges and all, behind. My roommate, Linda, was always prepared for action. She never had a thing beneath. She'd put me out of business. But what a way to go. Were there many like her at your school? I could write a thick book just about all the girls who went to our school. And believe me, it would really be a terrific hit, a number one, sexy bestseller, but I'm not a writer. However, I love to talk, so I'll tell you what about Linda. Last fall, she took off and found a job picking grapes in a little village in the valley. She had to work very hard. Picking grapes is not so easy. But she needed the money, and she didn't want her parents to find her and send her back to school. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, this is hard work. Say, you learn very quickly. Yes. I'm very fast, and I love to try new things. So you like it here? Yes. Yes, I do. You know, you're a very handsome man. Oh, Linda, you're teasing again. Don't you want me to tease you? We could have a lot of fun together, if you want? Don't you think so? Come. You know, Linda, I'm just a simple farm boy, but when I get near you, I feel so many things. I wish I could see more of you, do you know what I mean? Linda-- Oh, Linda. Shall I show you more? Oh, Linda, you're teasing me again. Yeah. You are leering. Uh-- Well, the show is over. We'd better get back to work. [MUSIC PLAYING] I've had enough of this. These city people pick a few grapes, and then eat like pigs. It costs more to feed them than they're worth. [GIGGLES] Did you sleep well last night? Well, uh-- I slept very well. All this fresh air makes me sleepy. FREDERICK: I eat jam at night. It gives me sweet dreams. Tell me, what do you dream about? What kind of jam is best for dreaming? Will you share some with me? You are teasing me again. I'll never worry about getting in a jam with you. You are too shy. Let's work faster today. Come on, hurry up. MAN: Grandma? Yeah? MAN: Why is Frederick always with the city girl? Because he is a stupid lovesick pup. LINDA: Frederick? Uh? You are such a tease. LINDA: [SIGHS] You're only good for the grapes. MAN: Hey, mama, know what I saw? What? MAN: A city girl's tushy. That's what she gets by wearing such a short skirt. MAN: She forgot to put on her panties. GRANDMA: Now you stay away from those two, you understand? MAN: Oh mother, I never have any fun. All I do is pick your sticky old grapes. LINDA: Fredrick, over here. I wondered where you had gone. I was thirsty. Have some. Thank you. I'm really hot. Help yourself. It's good. Thank you. It looks good. Oh. I thought you said you were thirsty. Oh, well, yes, I'm hot and thirsty. You look hot too. [GIGGLES] We ought to do something about that. Your room is next to mine, you know? Shall we have a jam session? [MUSIC PLAYING] [SNORING] [MUSIC PLAYING] FREDERICK: Oh, Linda. Wake up. I must be dreaming. Sweet dreams. Aren't you cold? Yes, I have goose bumps. But I'm warm-blooded. What an imagination you have. No, it's all true. Another girl at our school was the daughter of a great pianist. She was tone deaf and couldn't carry a tune in a basket. But Melody, that was her name, could really swing. You got to be making all this all put. GIRL: It's true. Cross my tits. [PIANO PLAYING] Finally. My father is a great pianist. Didn't you enjoy his performance? I'm looking forward to your performance. I don't know anything about music. Who cares? [LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, Melody, when will you grow up and stop insisting on playing these silly sex games? Pretending is better, you know? I want a real wife and real children. And I want many lovers. I'll be waiting for you. [LAUGHING] GIRL: Poor Melody. You went to school with her? Boy, what a school. Well, all those girls go sex crazy when they're locked up without men around, you know? I can't believe it. I should apply for a job there. I could teach gymnastics. And then there was this other broad, and she loved men, all sorts. She was starved for affection, perhaps, by her mother, who was a famous screen star. She never had time for Violet. Last year, she sent her to the country for the summer with some relatives. It was supposed to teach her self-reliance. [MUSIC PLAYING] That damn, yokel. I've been here two weeks and he hasn't made a pass yet. I'll heat him up. Good morning. VIOLET: Good morning, Jack. [MUSIC PLAYING] What brings you here? You. I'm Little Red Riding Hood taking a basket of food to my grandmother. But you look like the big bad wolf. Well, I'm hungry as a wolf. I've been working hard. But don't be afraid, I won't eat you up. Did you forget your lunch on purpose? I'm just glad I have a chance to see you alone. Are you happy to see me, Jack? Yes and no. Why aren't you happy to see me? JACK: I prefer to eat my lunch alone. VIOLET: Why do you keep avoiding me? JACK: Look, just because your mother is paying us to keep you here, it doesn't mean I have to entertain you. Stop that. VIOLET: Why? Don't you think I'm pretty? Are you afraid of girls? JACK: Yeah, I'm afraid of a cock-teaser like you. You'll get me all worked up for nothing. VIOLET: I'm not just teasing. I'm really hot for you. [GIGGLES] JACK: Yeah, well, if you're not careful, you'll catch a cold. VIOLET: It's you I'm trying to catch. JACK: Yeah, well-- well, I've been around, and I know all about girls like you. Is that so? JACK: Hey, what are you doing? Tempting you. Leave that bundle alone. I'll thrash you with one of those sticks. You'll have to catch me first. You asked for this. Well, I finally trapped you. Yeah, you're the one in the trap. [GRUNTING] She got her man all right, but after they made out, she got tired of the guy almost immediately. And when she went away, he broke up, that poor sucker. I think you silly men will never learn about girls. I also want to tell you about Lorna. Every holiday, she had to go with her folks to the country, but happily, she spent most of it with a buddy from our school, Heidi. You never run down. Time goes by quickly, so I don't mind. GIRL: Heidi and Lorna were birds of a feather. They often worked as a team. And they could almost read each other's minds. Anyhow, that was easy, because their minds were always on one thing-- sex. [MUSIC PLAYING] I wouldn't say this is much of a holiday-- no men at the school and none around here either. It's so dull. We'll have to look for some excitement. Hey, I think that might be it. Wilson? Damn, damn, damn, what's wrong his flipping car? Oh. Hello, girls. Having trouble? Yes. I wonder if you could direct me to the nearest garage around here? Let's see, you could make a phone call to the garage from there at my house, if you like. Yes, that would really be nice. OK. Come along. How can I thank you? I'll call you in a little while, Heidi. - Bye. - Goodbye. Thanks again! What luck to find such an angel of mercy here in the middle of nowhere. Lucky for me, too. How so? To meet someone new. Do you live with your parents? Yes, but they're away. This is very nice of you. I have to be at an important meeting tomorrow morning. I hope they can repair it soon. It's cold. Here's the phone-- 3535. The garage number? Yes. I wish you weren't in such a hurry to go. [PHONE RINGING] Jalopy garage, may I help you? Yes, my car is broken down here. At the country crossroad. I left my car at the cross crossroad. Do you know it? WOMAN (ON PHONE): It will take time. This is an emergency. I must be on my way. WOMAN (ON PHONE): So soon? Right now. WOMAN (ON PHONE): The mechanic is out now on a job. Oh. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Sorry. Look, I must leave here tonight. I have to be in town for a meeting tomorrow morning. I'm ready to pay extra. Send out the mechanic. WOMAN (ON PHONE): It won't be possible. You'd better find a place to pass the night. I'll try to get in touch with the mechanic tomorrow. You must understand and find me someone who'll fix the car tonight. WOMAN (ON PHONE): I understand, but you might as well relax until tomorrow. How can I relax? Oh, to hell with it then. Goodbye. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Have a good night. LORNA: Cheer up. Oh. Cheers. Bottoms up. That's it. You're welcome to share my bed. Hey. It's boring here in the country all alone. I need some excitement in my life. [MUSIC PLAYING] You're a pretty girl, and you're certainly exciting to me. I'll do my best to make you forget your very important meeting. Yeah. Yeah, I'd forgotten already. Let's dance. How old are you? I'm 16. What difference does it make? There's a big difference in our ages. I need a man who's been around a lot. Well, I travel a great deal. You're making fun of me. You know what I mean. I really like your style. Take me with you tomorrow when you go. Well, I wish I could, but I have a wife and six kids who need me. Don't you need someone for yourself? I can be very discreet. It would be exciting for both of us. You're tempting me, you little vixen. Really-- You know what I mean. Listen, I could give you a little R&amp;R. How about it, honey? Tell me first, what does R&amp;R mean? It means rest and recreation. I think I could use that. But you're terribly young for me. Hey, man, let me worry about that. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] How did everything go? LORNA (ON PHONE): OK. Great. Wait a second. Somebody might be listening. All right. It's OK. How was your old man? LORNA (ON PHONE): Not bad. Do you want to try him? Yes, but not in the middle of the night. LORNA (ON PHONE): It'll be more fun if you came now. Would it be OK, are you sure? LORNA (ON PHONE): Sure, it'll be a real blast. He is ready for action. OK. Just leave the door open. LORNA (ON PHONE): Oh, you're a good sport. Sure. LORNA (ON PHONE): You won't be sorry. Is that so? LORNA (ON PHONE): Yes, you'll see. He's a real stud. - OK. I don't need a commercial. LORNA (ON PHONE): Oh, this will be fun. Yeah. Bye, bye. [MUSIC PLAYING] I wouldn't mind if my car broke down. I'd like to be a victim of all those girls. Don't worry, if anything goes wrong with your car, I'm an expert mechanic, believe it or not. I lived on my brother's motorcycle. And one day, I met this girl Nadia, at one of his motorcycle races. Boy that thing burned up a track. She awarded herself as first prize to the winner of every race. She never stopped racing home, really. ANNOUNCER: Here we are at the Parisian Super, the biggest cross-country motorcycle race of the year. Eddie Gabretta is a big favorite, along with Van der Mersh and Scamia. We can't rule out Maxi Wells, however. Maxi is coming first with many of the fastest tracks in Europe. The fans have been trying to get close to Eddie to wish him luck or to grab something for a souvenir. They're lining up, and they're off, and running across the open field, maneuvering their bikes, given the best positions possible. I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, there's something about these races, you know, when man and machine have to operate as one organ that brings a tear to my eye. They've arrived at the cat's head, narrowing down the bigger approach and up and over they go. Eddie Gabretta, the crowd favorite, has taken an early lead, followed closely by Van der Mersh and Maxi Wells. But hold your bets, ladies and gentlemen, because it's still anybody's race. Look at those devils go up that hill. I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, this takes courage and insanity. My god. Racer 27 was unable race two weeks ago, but he's back in competitions already. Number two is Iggie Well, a newcomer to the track. He is running a bit slow, but moving up fast. The crowded is very excited. These people are a devoted group of motorcycle enthusiasts. They'd never miss a race. Here comes Eddie now, moving like a flaming comet, followed by Van der Mersh and Maxi Wells. Now comes the big test, out of 50 starters, 13 still remain in the race. Here they come to Devil's Pass, a 90-degree incline. It looks like somebody is in trouble. It's Maxi Wells. Oh, he'll have to go back to make another approach. Oh, what rotten luck. He'll have to make up a lot of time. He was running up first there behind Gabretta and Van der Mersh. Here he comes around again for another try. Will he make it? Yes! Yes! He's over the top. And now Scottie Young has moved ahead of Eddie Gabretta. Eddie looks as though he's lost his nerve. That old recklessness he's so well known for seems to have been replaced by caution. This may well be his last race. Although, one can see that he's still the crowd favorite. Now the racers must pass through the mud canyon. Not a difficult passage for the experienced men, but we almost always see a few of the younger drivers wipe out on this one. As a matter of record, there are only 20 minutes till the end of the race. And they're all driving with more care than they did in the beginning. It looks like-- yes, yes, it's Eddie Gabretta. He's moved up in the first place once again, and proved-- Eddie? ANNOUNCER: --that he's still the top man in his category. Scottie Young second. And the surprise of this race is Diggie Wells has come in third. Congratulations, Mr. Gabretta. Courtesy of Lee Films. Thanks. Thanks. It was a good race. I enjoyed it. We're proud of you, Eddie. I owe it all to my motorcycles and my mom. Hello out there. Thanks to you all. [MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me, I'd like to know in what hotel Gabretta is staying. I don't know if he'd want me to tell you. Oh. Let's see. I appreciate this. He's staying at the Wilder Man. Thanks, my friend, a lot. [KIDS LAUGHING] Why are we leaving the main road here already? Oh well, all your talk on this long drive has, uh-- worn me out. And I know of a comfortable hotel not far away. Hm. Is that so? Do you want me to leave then, is that it? [MUSIC PLAYING] Who else do you bring to this hotel? The desk club knows your habits very well it seems. Aren't you happy here? What difference does it make if I'm happy or not to you? You came in here on your own free-- do you want to leave now? It's cold outside. Well then, tell me all about yourself. All right. That's settled. GIRL (VOICEOVER): I ran away from school once before. I didn't have any money then either. So I got a job as a model at the Academy of Art. It was really out of sight. There I was, sticking my boobs up and my ass out. And these retarded Picasso's tried to sketch my nude body. Some of these guys wanted to do more than to sketch me. [MUSIC PLAYING] They'd have these wild fantasies about me. Hello. How much? Nothing. Then what? You are a whore, right? Here. Hm? You're paying me? Mm-hmm. Come now. Do you always pay for sex? Yes, I enjoy it more when I pay for it. You'll work here. Very nice. Take your clothes off and give me my money's worth. Don't worry. I'll give it to you any way you want. TEACHER: That is plain conjuring. [CHUCKLES] Yes, it's about time you got down to work. Oh, that's it. I can tell that you concentrated on her form very carefully. Those sketches are approaching realism. [MUSIC PLAYING] GIRL (VOICEOVER): Another frustrated artist saw me as a sweet young innocent, and he would daydream my seduction all through the class period. You should remember she's a child. Don't worry, the lessons won't be difficult for her. You know, I trust you professor. [MUSIC PLAYING] Today, we study art history. I didn't do my homework. We'll do it now together. Your aunt will be gone for the afternoon? Yes. Lesson one-- TEACHER: And then, add flesh to your composition. A baby must crawl before he can walk. The creation of a masterpiece begins with careful craftsmanship. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello. Take me in your arms. I'm yours. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm not a statue. I'm made of flesh and blood. I'm tired of standing motionless. [MUSIC PLAYING] And one, and two, and three, and four. I think I'm going out of my mind. Either you're as remote and cold as a statue, or you are jumping around like a daffy flapper. I don't care whether I draw your picture or not, I draw a deep breath every time I draw near you. Please don't draw out your dance. Draw aside with me or draw and quarter you, and draw a gun on myself. [GIGGLES] Draw, draw, draw. Draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw. GIRL (VOICEOVER): I was crazy about him, but he was married. So we had to steal our few moments together wherever possible. I'm sorry I'm late. Better late than never. You're always in such a hurry. Come on, hurry up. We'll drive to the forest. That reminds me of a joke. Yeah? A pretty girl walks in the forest, her boyfriend follows her, not far behind, then along comes an old forest ranger. He's not very far behind the boy. But in a short time, the pretty girl leaves the forest. Her boyfriend followed. And the poor old ranger stays alone in the forest. [LAUGHING] That's not bad. Pull down your pants. You're such a romantic. Hurry up. You like the way I fuck, don't you? Foreplay is nice, you know? I don't like group sex. You're a kinky kid, you know? You're ready? Let's go. Now what's the matter? What are you looking for? Well, I had a box of tissues somewhere here in the car. I think it saw a pack there under your coat. It's not there. Is it way in the back. Jeez, what a great lover. Oh shit, it's the forest ranger. He's writing down my license number. If my wife receives that ticket, I'll really be in trouble. GIRL: It could mean trouble for me, too, if they caught me here. Well? I don't know. He's walking away it seems. Ronnie, what can we do now? I just wish I could get a hold of that ticket. I have an idea, if you'll help me. It might work. What? Listen-- Tell me what I have to do. Well, pay a visit to the old man and talk him into giving the ticket back. Me? Of course, you. Do you think you can do it? I guess I'll have. Yes, if you want to see me again. Well, I'm not too sure if I want to or not, but this might be fun. I wonder how far I'll have to go. Not far, with that old man. Hurry up. I have to get home. Are you lonesome, Peter Rabbit? You stay here, fellow. She likes Peter best. You know that. Come, Peter. I have company for you. There. All right, get to it, Peter. What are you doing, Peter, my man? A wham, a bam, and a thank you, ma'am. If you don't hurry up, I'll put your friend in there with her. You think you're on a merry-go-round. You'll tire poor Peter out. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ooh, I wish I could get in there and show you how to do it. Oh. [LAUGHING] I wouldn't waste so much time. I thought rabbits were supposed to be quick about it. You're a disgrace too your breed. [LAUGHING] Stick it in her. Hang on tight. Don't let her get away. Oh. Oh. Oh, you're making the whole cage move. [LAUGHING] I wonder how this act would go in a porn movie? GIRL: Very good. A wood nymph. Mm-hm, that's right. Please, I need your help. How? Have you been raped in my forest? No, I intend to rape you uncle. Good god, are you blind? You're talking to an old man, you know? I have a deal for you. You must give me something important for which I am ready to trade my body, mm? What could I have that you want? All I want is the paper with the number of the license of our car. Ah, the ticket. You are trying to bribe a state official, my dear. But it's possible that I could be corrupted. Let's talk this thing over. Because it's an official document, let's go to my sitting room. After you, my dear. [LAUGHING] Here, on the straw? Why not? It's soft. Are you sure about this? Oh, yes. [MUSIC PLAYING] That was some roll in the hay. Not bad for an old man. Come. Thank you, wood nymph. You gave me much pleasure. And besides, you are a delicious dumpling. Yeah, and you're sweet. Oh dear, I mustn't forget the document. Here, I'll get it for you. I envy you, your life here in this cozy cottage in the woods. It's so peaceful and calm. Well now, I suppose you want the ticket. I'll get it. Just a moment. That's what you came for. Oh, yes. Here. This is the incriminating evidence. Thanks. I don't understand. Well, uh-- what's on that paper, the only notes I took-- I was counting all the trees which will be cut down. I'm not authorized to make parking tickets. [LAUGHING] You old faker. Finally. Did you get it? Good girl. Hey, what's this? This isn't a ticket. Mm. I know. It's only a list of the bad trees that have to be cut out. And it took you all that time just to get this worthless list. It was time well spent. [MUSIC PLAYING] I think you were afraid I wasn't going to stay with you tonight. I almost fell asleep waiting. It was a long day. I'll tell you a bedtime story. Oh, no. Move over, I'm cold. Don't hog all the covers. Now, did I tell you the story about the traveling salesman? TRAVELING SALESMAN: Oh, my god. GIRL: He stopped this girl, a friend of mine. TRAVELING SALESMAN: OK. That's enough. Now, listen-- [GIGGLES] --I'm going to make up a story for you. [LAUGHING]
