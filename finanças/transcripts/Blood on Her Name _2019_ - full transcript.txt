(pensive music) (Leigh gasping) (pensive music) (door latching) (pensive music) - Ryan? (hand banging) Ryan? Hey, it's me, open the door. Ryan? (pensive music) (video game beeping) (pensive music) (thunder rumbling) (door rattling) (ominous music) (keys jingling) (engine rumbling) (animals calling) (Leigh groaning) (bird chirping) (pensive music) (plastic rustling) (phone ringing) (phone chimes) - [Voicemail] Hey Dad, just wondering where you are. Looks like you didn't come home last night, but you should know Mom's pretty pissed about it. I just hope everything's okay. Just give me a call. (Leigh vomiting) (birds chirping) (clock ticking) (water running) (Leigh whimpering) (engine rumbling) - Hey. It's best not to mention last night, all right? It would just complicate things. - Well, who was he? - I don't know. He was probably lookin' for somethin' to steal. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm all right. It's not as bad as it looks. - What happened to him? - He, he ran off right after you left. - I would have stayed. - No. You did the right thing. I didn't want you gettin' hurt. Hey? I know you would have. Thank you. (shop bell dings) - You must be Leigh. - Where's Officer Boyd? - Officer Boyd is no longer with the department. I'm your new probation officer, Ryan. Nathan Parrish. - Hi. - Can I get you something? - Oh, we won't be long. Thank you though. - Bring him a coke. Is everything all right? - Yeah, just got a lot goin' on today. - [Nathan] How are things Ryan? - Fine. - Broken any laws since last check in? - No. - [Nathan] Anymore fights? - [Ryan] No Sir. - You the one that hit your mom? - It was an accident at work. - That true? - Yeah. Yes Sir. - What do you do when your mom's at work? - He works at the shop with me. - Where's that? - Tiller's Auto. - Husband's? - Ex. It's mine now. He's not involved. - Why not? - 'Cause he's in jail. - Hm. Like father like son, huh? Drugs, alcohol? - No Sir. - It's better that you tell me now. (patrons chattering) - He's a good kid. - You blinded a boy in his left eye. - The kid was pickin' on him about his dad bein' sent off. Supposed to not fight back? - I got folders full of people with reasons for what they did. It doesn't put the skin back on the cat. File has a note from the court, says that you're behind on your restitution. - Yeah. - Now if you don't get that paid it's gonna be a hell of a time clearin' his record. - Things have been tight. I'll catch up. - I've been doin' this a long time Miss Tiller. Good kids don't end up here. - He doesn't know you. You mean to pee on that cup? Atta boy. (engine rumbling) (doors slamming) (wind whistling) - Must be nice bein' the boss's kid. Sleep late, ramble in whenever. - [Leigh] You good? - Hey, I got a truck over here that needs your help. - What's wrong with it? - [Rey] You tell me, kid. (pensive music) (keyboard keys clacking) (pensive music) (door unlatching) What's up with Ryan? - Nothin', just... we had that meeting with the PO this mornin'. - Is everything okay? - It's fine. It's nothin'. - [Rey] Bullshit. - I was, I was workin' too fast. You know, took a little fall. I'm all right. - Who did that? - There was just, there was a break in last night. Some junkie probably thinkin' the place was empty. I guess I startled him. It's not a big deal, all right? He lost interest as soon as he realized it wasn't an easy score. - Did you call the cops? Maybe we could pull the tapes in the cameras. - [Leigh] Like I said, it's not a big deal. - Leigh, don't do somethin'-- - Just let it go. I'm sorry. I know you're just... It's just a break in, all right? We don't need a bad reputation with the few customers we got left. - Hey, your dad came by. - When? - Earlier today. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask. (door latches) (pensive music) (computer thuds) (pensive music) (trunk slams) (birds chirping) (children chattering) (dog barking) (police siren) - What are you doin' out here? - You ever do that again I'll report you. - I'm a year from forced retirement kid, what do you think they're gonna do to me? What happened to you? - What do you want? - I came by earlier. I know that Ryan's appointment was this mornin'. - He's fine. - That Parrish is a pain in the ass. - I said he's fine. - I was thinkin' that maybe Ryan could come see me sometime, take him off your hands for a couple hours. - I gotta go. (engine starting) - Would you at least tell him that I was askin' after him? - I'll see you around, Dad. - Well, see you around. (engine rumbling) (cellphone chiming) (pensive music) (thunder rumbling) (gentle music) (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) (engine rumbling) - How come we never take your police car? - [Richard] 'Cause you aren't big enough to ride in the front yet. - So? I'll ride in the back. - [Richard] The back is for bad guys only. (radio static crackling) - [CB Radio] Hey Richard, you there? (radio static) I got a situation I could use your help with. - [Richard] Ain't really a good time for it. - [Man Whispering] ... the place on Old Broughton. Right. Hm. I gotta make a quick stop before dinner, kid. (thunder rumbling) (engine rumbling) (Leigh groans) ("The Journey") ¶ Down the dark highway, I travel on ¶ ¶ To places I can't stay ¶ ¶ Like the tide, I'm pulled along ¶ ¶ Let Truth show me the way ¶ (music swells) (pensive music) - Come on, man. - Hey, come on. - Just let go of me. - Hey, you look good. - Just get the... (elbow slaps) (Colt groans) - [Colt's Friend] What the fuck was that? - God damn it, man. - Fuck! (engine starting) (train horn blaring) (Leigh panting) (Leigh screams) - [Customer] Ma'am? - I'm sorry, what? - Do I have to do it all now? - Oh, uh... It looks like you could wait a month or two on the axles if you want. - Hey. Sorry. - What is it? - Hoffman's called again. - [Leigh] I'll handle it. - They're gonna quit fillin' our orders. - I said I'll fuckin' handle it. Sorry, I didn't mean that. - Why don't you take off early today? Go soak in the tub or somethin'. - You sure? - Hell of a lot better than you yellin' at me all day. - Yeah, all right. Sounds nice. I'll be straight tomorrow. - I know you will. (engine rumbling) - [Ryan] What were you arguin' about? - What? - With the man who broke in. - Uh, I wasn't arguin'. I was tellin' him to leave. - It sounded like you were fightin' about money. - No, he was high. He wasn't makin' any sense. - He used to work with Dad. - Ryan. - [Ryan] Why did you say you didn't know him? - Can we just drop it please? Look, all that stuff with your father... it's behind us, all right? I want it to stay that way. - Where are we goin'? - I need to take care of soemthin'. You're gonna spend a few hours with your grandfather. (birds chirping) - How you doin' kid? - Good. - See that bird right there? - [Ryan] Yeah. - It's a pheasant, I just got it. Got some homing pigeons too. Tell you what Ryan, why don't you go up to the house. I just made some iced tea. Why don't you see if there's anything on TV you wanna watch, I'll be right with you. - Okay. - I don't let him watch anything R-rated. - Okay. - And nothin' too violent. - Right. I was surprised to get your call. - Well, some time to myself sounded nice. - Hm. I've had about as much of that as I care for. - I'll be back in a few hours. - Take your time. (Leigh knocking) - What's up? Rough week? This is stronger shit than you're used to. - Thanks. - Thank you. - How much should I take? - Uh, how much trouble you lookin' to get off your back? Those are fives. You start with one, you'll be good. - Hey? You uh, you mind if I hang out for a bit? I just need someplace quiet. - Yeah, uh, knock yourself out. Oh, uh, I wanted to tell you I uh, I finish my parol in August. I think I might head back to Michigan. I'll set you up with a new guy. - You tell Jesse? - Your ex and I don't really chat anymore. You? (Reed sighs) This place is a mess. (pensive music) - Hey, did you um, did you notice if I was wearin' a necklace when I came in here? - No, I don't think so. - Yeah, okay. Just call me if you find it. Okay. Okay. - Can I help you? - Yeah, I was uh, I was in here last night. - Yeah, I remember. I spent a half hour cleanin' up blood and glass. - Do you um, did you happen to find a necklace while you were cleanin' up? Silver? Okay. Thanks. (objects rustling) It's not in here. - Then I guess I didn't find it. - Please, it's um, it's a little silver chain, had a wrench on it. It's really important. - Well, you maybe you should check with that fella you were grindin' your snatch on last night. (engine rumbling) (children playing) (Leigh knocking) (shots firing in the distance) - That's not bad. You see how the water's runnin' toward the creek? You always wanna watch a suspect's feet. See if he's about to run. You see which foot his weight is on, then lead him that way just by a hair. (shot firing) (water splashing) - Time to go Ryan. - Just let me try one more time. - Ryan. - We'll get 'em next time. - You haven't changed a bit. - Hey. Hey! What's stuck in your craw? - Not half a day with the kid and you got him picturing bullets goin' through heads. - He said he'd never shot a revolver. - [Leigh] And you thought it was your job to fix that? - I think that he hadn't seen his dad in three years. What's goin' on with you? - You're a poison. That's what's goin' on. - The boy needs to know how to take care of himself, things at the shop bein' how they are. - Beatin' around the bush doesn't suit you. - Ryan told me there was a break in. - Boy needs to keep his mouth shut. - Easy. He was scared. - He say anything else? - He didn't seem much for talkin' about it. Why didn't you tell me? - 'Cause it doesn't concern you. - You forget what I do? - No. No, I didn't forget. - If you got somethin' to say, say it. - This was a mistake. (door slams) - [Richard] Ryan? - Hey. - What? - I'm just lookin' out for you. - By makin' sure I can't defend myself? - By makin' sure you have the right influences. - Well, I can make my own choices. - Yeah, you've done a real great job of that so far. (door slams) Shit. Ryan? (pensive music) Hey, have you seen my necklace? (objects clattering) (crickets chirping) (pensive music) (train horn blaring) (trunk slams) (engine rumbling) - [Travis] Hey Mom, Dad's home. - [Dani] Tell him to sleep on the fucking couch. (Leigh gasps) - [Travis] Hey Dad, you in there? Dad? (Travis grimaces) Oh fuck, no. Mom! Mom! (Leigh panting) (thunder cracking) (rain pattering) (girl humming) (rain pattering) - What are you drawin'? It's a circle. It gets bigger and bigger. Like a fingerprint. (glass shattering) (pensive music) Hey. (shot firing) (Rey knocking) - Leigh? You in there? (door unlatching) Oh, thank God. I've been tryin' your cell. We had another break in. Did you sleep here? - Shit. - [Rey] Customers, no customers, we gotta call the police. - There um, there wasn't a break in. - What? - I was lookin' for somethin'. I meant to clean up. I guess I just fell asleep. Rey. - [Rey] I'm goin' out. (tires on gravel) - Spring cleanin'? - I thought I made myself pretty clear. - [Richard] I'm starting to remember why we don't talk much. (Leigh sighs) - I can think of plenty of reasons we don't talk much. - Jesus kid, I've seen priests less hung up on old sins. - You just come by to complain about how you're treated? - Where's Ryan? - [Leigh] He's not here. - The other day when I saw you out by the trailer park, you never said what you were doin' out there. - The truck was over heatin'. I was lettin' it cool. - Horse shit. Try harder. - I don't know what you want from me, so if you don't mind... - A fella turned up dead yesterday, about 100 yards from where your truck overheated. - [Leigh] Hm, that so? - Name was Cobb. - That supposed to mean somethin'? - It ought to. He used to run stolen cars through here with your ex. - Well, if you think Jesse had somethin' to do with it, you know where to find him. - Tell me you don't know how he got dead, Leigh. - You know what? Fuck you. - You put that God damn tire down and you look at me! (pensive music) (Leigh sniffles) Jesus Christ. - I don't know what to do. - What the fuck happened? - He broke into the shop. He musta not known I was here. When he saw me he just, he went crazy, like he was on somethin'. And I grabbed a wrench. - You... Where's the wrench? - It's gone. - Why didn't you report it? - I don't know. I mean I panicked. I, I thought if they made the connection with Jesse they'd take the shop. - Why did you take the body back to the trailer? - 'Cause he has a family. - Who the fuck cares? - I couldn't just disappear a man like that. Leave his people wonderin'. - Well that's great Leigh. Now his people know. - I know it was stupid. - You're damn right it was stupid. You bury it, ya burn it. Shit, you dump it in a lake. - This isn't your problem. - You're my daughter. This is my problem. - I don't want your help. - You're a master criminal now? Hm? You cover your tracks pretty thoroughly? - [Leigh] I didn't say that. - What about that camera up on the wall behind me? Is that connected to anything? - No. - You think that he took any of your skin with him to the morgue? What about fingerprints, what about hair? Did anybody see you actin' strange? You tell me they're not gonna find your DNA on his pecker. - Just stop it! (Richard sighs) - Leigh. - What do I do? - You the prayin' kind? I'll go see what I can learn. I need a fuckin' drink. (somber music) (pensive music) Ryan? (pensive music) (door unlatching) (bottles clinking) Oh, Ryan. Hey. Sorry. - [Ryan] You gonna lecture me about not comin' this morning? - Hey, listen, I was thinkin', we should get outta here. Just take a little vacation. - What are you talkin' about? - I just mean when was the last time we just went somewhere? - [Ryan] What about the shop? - Well, Rey can take care of the shop or we'll close it for a couple weeks. - A couple weeks? - Yeah. Let's just go somewhere okay? Let's forget about cars and school and work. We can go anywhere. You name the place. - Ragwater Falls? - Yeah, okay. Yeah, you tell me where it is and we'll go. - I don't know. It was just some place Rey was talkin' about but, maybe California or Colorado but it's like rafting and fishing and stuff. - That's sounds great. Go pack your bag. - Aren't we supposed to call first? - Right. Um, yeah we, we'll call your P.O. from the road. - Mom. - Please don't argue with me okay? - I don't wanna get in trouble. Just call 'em. - All right, I'll call. I'll give 'em a call. (gentle music) - I'll be in the shop if you need me. (gentle music) - There's a customer here. Says she wants to see you. - Can I help you? - My name's Dani Wilson. I think you worked with my boyfriend Daryl Cobb? (pensive music) - Yeah, I'm sorry I think you got the wrong person. - I ain't here to cause trouble. - Like I said I don't know anything-- - But I will if I have to. Look, I ain't no snitch. I don't give a shit about stolen cars. - I don't know what you're talkin' about. - Daryl turned up dead yesterday. I just need to know why. - I'm really sorry to hear that. (Dani sighs) You talk to the police? - The police don't give a shit. He's just some junkie to them. Did he ever talk about anybody who could have been angry at him or maybe somebody's car he'd stolen that had found him? - Sorry. Look, I don't want any trouble all right? Cars are my ex's thing. I wish I could help you, I just, I don't know anything about what happened to your boyfriend. - [Dani] Did he ever talk about anybody that he might have worked with or... - No, I'm sorry. If anything comes to mind I'll let you know. (ominous music) (Leigh gasps) - Well, thank you for your time. Oh my God. - It's not what you think. - Oh my God. You get out of my way. - I can't do that. - [Ryan] Mom? - Ryan, just get back to work buddy. - Is everything okay? - It's fine. Just go on out back with Rey. I swear to God, it was an accident. He, he attacked me. (door slams) - Leigh? - I'm in trouble Rey. (Leigh sniffling) - [Rey] Let's get outta here. (engine rumbling) - [Ryan] You comin'? - Ryan, I... If you um... If you ever need your papers, your birth certificate or anything, there's a shoe box in my closet. - Okay. - Just-- - [Rey] Hey. [Rey] Foods gettin' cold. (somber music) - You hungry? I'm starvin'. (door slams) - [Rey] All right, come on. I need your answer. - The wrist pin? - Nope. Wrist pin holds the piston to the connecting rod. That's oh for three. Guess who's got broom duty tomorrow? - Mom's the one who made the mess. - Excuse me? - [Rey] I used to make stupid bets like that with your dad all the time. You remember that? - Oh yeah. I remember you used to lose all the time. - Did you like him? My dad? - Your dad was a, complicated guy. He was really hard to know. But hey, he made the world's greatest kid. - Al right buddy, it's bed time. - Come on. - Say goodnight. - Goodnight. - [Rey] Goodnight. How bad is it? - You don't wanna know. - Probably not but I don't see anybody else lining up trying to help. - I fucked up, Rey. I didn't stop running cars after Jesse got put away. - Jesus. - Hey, it was the only thing keepin' us afloat. You know how things are. I had to think about Ryan, about you. - Don't put that on me. - I didn't mean it like that. - There wasn't a break in was there? - I had a fight with Jesse's guy. I swapped the VIN numbers on a truck. He was supposed to bring me the money but his buyer fell through. So he said he wasn't gonna pay me till he found another one. I told him that wasn't the deal, I'd already done the work. I lost my temper. I threw a wrench. We, we had a fight. It was an accident. - What was an accident? (Leigh gasping) Oh, Jesus, Leigh. Why didn't you call the cops? - And tell 'em what? Huh? His girlfriend knows. - [Rey] The woman from the shop? - I keep thinking I hear sirens. Is that weird? - Does Ryan know? - He deserves better, Rey. A dad in jail, a mom on the way, a grandfather... Might as well lock him up myself. - He's a good kid. He'll be okay. - What do they even do, if a kid's got no parents? - He's always welcome with me, you know that. - I couldn't ask you that. - And you're not gonna have to. We're gonna get this thing figured out. (gentle music) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (door shutting) (pensive music) (men whispering) - [Richard] Your service weapon? You shot the man with your service weapon? - [Man] Shit. - [Richard] Report it stolen. Dump it somewhere. - [Man] Won't that seem suspicious? - [Richard] You think you got a better idea? God damn it! - [Man] What was I supposed to do? - [Richard] Shake him down, not shoot him. Help me move him. (body thuds) - [Man] You think your girl heard? What if she says somethin'? - [Richard] She's a good girl. She'll do what she's told. (door creaking) (Travis yells) (Travis groaning) (Leigh groaning) - It was you that killed my daddy? - Please! Please (groans)! - You scream, I kill your son too. - You don't have to do this. (Leigh choking) - Shut up! (Leigh screaming) (Travis groaning) (Leigh wheezing) - Rey! It's her son. (Leigh gasping) (gun loading) Ryan, no. - Whoa, whoa buddy. It's okay. Leigh. - Buddy? Hey, give it to me. Ryan? It's okay. It's okay. Hey, hey. We're okay. - Hey buddy, hey? You got any duct tape around, huh? - Yeah? - Okay, can you go get it for me? - Yeah. - [Rey] All right. - [Leigh] Yeah. - You gotta call the cops. - I know. (thunder rumbling) (crickets chirping) You okay? Hey buddy, come on. Let's go inside. It's startin' to rain. Look, I'm really sorry about all this. - He didn't get away did he? The man at the garage? It was me that killed him wasn't it? - No, Ryan. - Stop lyin' to me. I felt it break in his head. - That is not the way it happened. - Yes it is. - No. There was a fight. That man attacked me. - No. - I hit him, he went down. You weren't anywhere around. - That's not the truth. - I don't care what the truth is. This is the truth now. You understand? Look. I made some really shitty decisions. That's why we're in the situation we're in right now. - I killed that kid's dad. - He attacked me. You didn't do anything wrong. - Then why is it a secret? - 'Cause it's just simpler that way. - It's because of the trouble I got in. You're scared I'm like dad. - Ryan, you are nothin' like your father. - Well then who am I like? You? (Ryan scoffs) (Leigh sighs) - [Rey] He's a lot stronger than you think. - [Travis] Fuck you, you stupid fuckin' bitch. (Travis groaning) - Hey, hey, no, no! - [Travis] Get off me! - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. (Travis mumbling) Look, it's not gonna help, okay? We'll get a lawyer and we'll get this thing figured out. - Yeah. (Knocking) - Okay. Just don't tell 'em that the kid broke in. That's it. Okay? (Knocking) - [Richard] Leigh? - You didn't call the cops? - I just need some advice first. - You know damn well the kind of advice he's gonna give you. (gentle music) - You should get outta here. - [Richard] Leigh open up. (door latches) (Leigh sniffles) You all right? - I'm okay. - Ryan? - [Leigh] He's fine. He's in his bedroom. - You fucked up, kid. How'd he find you? - His mom must've told him. - How'd she find you? - [Leigh] I lost my necklace when I was droppin' him off. She must've found it. - You didn't think that was worth tellin' me? - I didn't expect it to get this far. - It has. - What am I lookin' at? If I turn myself in? - That depends. You really stop runnin' cars after Jesse got sent up? Right. Felony murder. - It was self defense. - It doesn't matter. Stealin' cars-- - Swapping tags. - Is a felony. And the piece of shit was killed in the commission of the crime. - All right, okay. All right. There's gotta be another way. - I think you know there is. - I can, I'll talk to her. I can explain that... God damn it. - Look at me. I checked down at the department. They ain't got shit for evidence, and they ain't lookin' for any, but if you're tellin' me that this woman and her boy, they know somethin' about you, they got proof-- - No, no, no. No, I am not like you. I don't have that in me. - So you said your whole damn life but here we are. Livin' with somethin' like this is a son of a bitch, but it's livin'. - I don't want the kid here anymore. Take him to the shop. - Okay. Then what? - I don't know (sniffles). Don't, don't do anything until I get there. - What about the girl? (Leigh gasping) - I'll figure somethin' out. (Knocking) I came to see if you could watch Ryan? - You must think of me as a real asshole, huh? - That is not-- - Don't. You want him to find a different way? Show it to him. - Why didn't you call the cops? - Because I knew that you wouldn't hurt him. - Maybe I already did. - [Rey] Did you? - Please Rey. I'm not askin' for me. Hey, did you um, did you tell Ryan about some raftin' or fishin' place? Colorado maybe? - Yeah. - I think it caught his imagination. Might be nice to take him sometime. (gentle music) - What's gonna happen to him? - Your grandfather's gonna take him to jail. - What if I told them it was my fault? Would he still have to go? - Some things just can't be undone. Hey? You've got so much good in you. - I'm sorry, about what I said. About not bein' like you. - No, no. - I didn't-- - Hey. (Leigh sniffling) All right. I'll see ya in the morning. (pensive music) (fan whirring) (Dani gasps) You send him to kill me? - What? - Your boy? You send him for revenge. - Where is he? Where's my son? - He broke in and attacked me. - Is he... - He's fine, for now. - Oh God. - Are you sayin' you didn't know? - It ain't like he didn't have good reason. - Why haven't you called the cops yet? - Did Cobb really attack you the night you killed him? - Mm hm. - Sounds like him. You here to kill me now too? You don't seem like the type. - That's enough. - Tryin' to protect someone? Is it the Mexican? - I said that's enough. - Fuck. (pensive music) Easy momma bear, we both got cubs we're worried about. - Pack your bags. - What? - For both of you. You got two minutes. We're gonna go get your boy, you're gonna get in your car and you're gonna get outta here. - Where are we supposed to go? - North, south, east, west, I don't give a shit! But you are gonna stay the fuck away from me and my son. (pensive music) (tires on gravel) Hey? - Yeah? - [Leigh] It's me, we're comin' in. - Oh Jesus. - All right, that's far enough. Good girl. (pensive music) What are you doin'? - These two are gonna get in their car. They're leavin' town. - Leigh. You've lost your nerve. - Don't touch me. - What do you think is gonna happen, Leigh? You think they're gonna just walk out of here and forget everything? - That's exactly what they're gonna do. - And what if they don't? What happens when that bitch and her pup are 20, 30 miles down the road and you don't have that gun on 'em? You're gonna be livin' with what you do right now for a long time. - They don't deserve this. - Nobody said they did. - I'm not killin' anyone tonight. - Jesus Christ. - No! - No, don't! - Get outta the way. - No. (shot firing) (object clattering) (Travis groaning) - Can't guard both of 'em girl. Come on. Let's finish it now. (gun cocking) - [Leigh] Put it down. (shots firing) - Everything that I've ever done was to protect you. - Bullshit. I've kept your secrets my whole life. A kid should never be asked such a thing. - Leigh! - No, Travis! (shots firing) - Leigh! - No! No! (Dani groaning) (Richard groaning) (objects clattering) (Dani screams) (tense music) - No! (Dani gasping) (Richard groaning) - [Dani] Travis, run! (shot firing) (Leigh gasping) (Dani gasping) - You killed him. - [Dani] That wasn't my plan. Oh God. Was he a cop? - Yeah. - [Dani] Oh shit, shit, shit. - I didn't tell my dad to hurt your boy. - I didn't send Travis to kill you. - We gonna just kill each other anyway. - There's somethin' that I need to know. Why did you bring him to me? Why didn't you just bury him in the fuckin' woods? - Does it matter? (Dani sniffling) You needed to know. (Dani sobbing) It doesn't have to end like this. We can both walk away. - Then what? - I don't know. I don't care. I just wanna go home. (Dani sobbing) (Leigh exhaling) I'm comin' out now. - Don't you fuckin' move. - Easy. I'm just gettin' your keys. (keys jingling) I'm puttin' my gun down now. - You're a good person, Leigh.
