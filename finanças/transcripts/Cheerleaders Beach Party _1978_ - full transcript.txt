BUCKY: Oh, come on, get him. Intercept, intercept! Oh, God. Touchdown. GERTRUDE: Yeah, Teague! BUCKY: Oh, Gertrude, that's Bill Ubell, he's the Rams' halfback. They're the other team, Gertrude. GERTRUDE: Sorry, Bucky. BUCKY: And that flankerback, Lee Williams. Christ, he never misses a kick, that son of a... There goes that Bill Ubell again. Phew! Rambling's beatin' the pants off of us. GERTRUDE: Now, Bucky, don't get so upset, you know what the... BUCKY: 14 to nothing and we're in the Big Five. [CHEERLEADERS CHANTING] GERTRUDE: Bucky, isn't that number 39, Jim Norris, their full tail? BUCKY: Full tail? Geez, Jim Norris is their fullback. Oh, Rambling's knocking the crap out of us. It's a freakin' shame. GERTRUDE: Bill Ubell, number 25, Lee Williams, number 27. BUCKY: Yeah, yeah, how do they do it? GERTRUDE: Oh, Jim Norris, 39. You know, it must be Coach Henson. BUCKY: Mother Hen Henson, maybe. GERTRUDE: A secret formula, Bucky? BUCKY: Yeah. Where does a dump like Rambling get all that piss and vinegar from, anyway? GERTRUDE: Bucky! Okay.

Yeah.Ready? BOYS: Kick ass! Here's to Mother Hen Henson, huh? [ALL CHEERING] And to his little chickens. [IMITATING CHICKENS] Ah, and here's to vacations. The longer, the better. Right on, Sissy. GIRLS: The longer, the better. And here's to...Oh, stop. I'm getting waterlogged. ALL: Aw! So, what are you guys gonna do on your vacation? And what did you have in mind? Sit on it, Lee. [ALL EXCLAIMING] I mean, are you gonna hang around here or what? Well, we haven't decided yet. I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to spend the whole time in bed with Mailer and Salinger and Vonnegut. BILL: Maybe I can slip in disguised as Fitzgerald, yeah? Hey, we'll be back in a minute. Where you goin', Lee? JIM: Well, we have to see a man about our dog.Yeah. Right. About a dog.We'll be back later. I don't see any dog. What's the mystery, Monica? I don't know. Who's he?I don't know. He looks awful familiar. Yeah, he does, or maybe he doesn't. I wonder what he's doing here, anyway. I think I know a way that we can find out. Just leave it to me, gang. Well, boys, that's it. Any comments? Well, it sounds great with me, Mr. Langley. A week in Bell Harbor. LANGLEY: And all expenses paid. I don't know, Mr. Langley, Rambling has been really good to us. I don't think I could do that to them. LANGLEY: Jim, football is not a popularity contest. Somebody always gets hurt, right? Let's look at it this way. What does Rambling U have to offer? A second-rate academic program. [TONI MOUTHING WORDS]A poorly financed athletic department. And what about status? A degree from Rambling U is practically meaningless in the right places. If you know what I mean. Yeah, well, uh... I don't know. All right, what does State U have to offer? Why, everything, Jim. Everything. A degree from State U is your passport to success. That is, if you qualify. That's why we're inviting you down to our conference at Bell Harbor. [MOUTHING WORDS]We'll see if we like each other, and if you are the kind of individual State U can accept. Now, if you prove your athletic ability, we can arrange a scholarship and a very lucrative living allowance. [FARTS] Well, boys, what's your decision? [MOUTHING] No, no, no, no. JIM: Sounds okay to me.BILL: It's okay here. Count me in.Well, good, that's settled. I am sure you will have a great time at Bell Harbor. After that, God willing, we'll see you off to State U. Oops!I'll get it. LEE: I really want to meet Coach Wilson. Oh, well, he'll be there, too, and I'm sure he will give you a stimulating workout. That son of a bitch is offering them the world. "A degree from State U is a passport to success." God damn it. Rambling U is in real trouble. Traitors!What are we going to do? I don't know, Monica. Don't they shoot traitors? Only in time of war. Well, what do you call this? [SIGHING] Heavy. That does it. We'll just fight fire with fire. Oh, like in The Towering Inferno. SHERYL: Come on, Coach. Please listen to us. And if our guys sign up with State U, where are we next year? Let's face it, coach, it's bad news. Don't you girls think you're overreacting? I heard it with my own ears. Langley is offering them scholarships, money, everything. Would you believe that thing can sleep six? My hat's off to modern technology. MONICA: Look, Coach, what is Rambling U going to do? Nothing.GIRLS: Nothing? Look, girls, I realize that if our star players go to State U the Rams are lost. But you've got to realize that we are a small college. No way Rambling can afford a recruiting program. The best we can offer them is a damn good education. GIRLS: Education? Well, maybe if you talked with them? I don't think that would accomplish anything. Besides, I've been looking forward to this camping trip all year. And in the morning, I'm going straight to the mountains. In the team's van? Sure, I'm the coach. Some coach. SHERYL: Well, thanks for everything, coach. Have a nice trip. I hope it's off a 50-foot cliff. Okay. See you now, girls. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO] All right, girls, I'll give you 30 seconds to tell me who this famous personality is. Okay, who do I look like? Gertrude Stein? No, Attila the Hun. Come on, girls, be serious. I'll give you a hint. She's a famous movie star. Harpo Marx? I got it. Lassie. Funny. Don't you think I look like... Look what I have. Fresh brownies. God, I'm so hungry, I could eat your curlers. Did you make these yourself? Sure did. Monica. To think you're a regular Julia Child. [GIGGLES] LEE: Hey, Toni, somebody, give me a towel. I want to take a shower. Come on, you can take a shower with me. Here's your towel. [SCREAMS] [LAUGHS] No! Cut it out. No! Oh, oh, oh, cut it out. Cut it out. [LAUGHING] MONICA: Oh, he's so cute. SHERYL: Yeah, but he's a traitor. You girls are about as much fun as an autopsy. I suppose at a time like this, you wanna cut up. What the hell are we supposed to do, mope around for the rest of our lives? Well, nobody likes to be on a losing team. You know damn well once our boys go to Bell Harbor, we're sunk. Well, maybe they won't like it there. Or maybe those State U dudes won't like them. TONI: I doubt it. Hey, maybe she's right. SHERYL: Fat chance. No, no, no, what if they don't play well. What if they really screwed up? What if they had such a miserable time that they'd reject State U's offer or vice versa. No way, have you ever been to Bell Harbor? It's beautiful. The beach, the sun, holy shit. No, Sheryl, you're missing the whole point. What if four little cheerleaders took a little trip to Bell Harbor and deliberately sabotaged their whole conference? Yeah, and while they're down there, maybe recruit some new State U players and come back to Rambling U as heroes. Heroines. Oh, you mean the hard stuff? Look, girls, I hate to burst your bubble, but how are we supposed to accomplish all this? We don't have any scholarships to offer them and we have no money to bribe them with. What do we have? We do we have? Here's what we have. A mirror? No. We've got the greatest asset Rambling U ever had. Us! And are we gonna use it, yeah. Monica, I think you've got it. Is it catching? [SIGHS] Now, the big problem. Wheels, bread and a place to stay. Oh, I've got $50. I've got about the same. TONI: Well, I can scrape up another 100. Good, I can dig up 50. So, that makes 250. That should cover food and gas, but what about wheels and a place to stay? SHERYL: I've got the wheels. Come on, that heap? Ha! You'd have to pay a junkyard to take that wreck. We gotta get there. Fast. What we need is a van or something like that. Yeah, and maybe we can get a tent. A tent? You know, go camping out. Like Coach Henson. Coach Henson. Van, tent... What do you think, girls? [ALL EXCLAIMING] Damn! These brownies are good. Yeah, Sissy, how did you make them? Oh, with some instant brownie mix and my secret ingredient. What's that? It's about an ounce and a half. [GIRLS EXCLAIMING] [GIRLS LAUGHING] SISSY: No fair! MONICA: What do we want?GIRLS: A real great team. How do we get it?Recruit 'em real mean. How do we do it?Sabotage, sabotage. Yeah, team! One, two, three, four, who do we put out for? Rambling U, Rambling U. Yeah, team! Five, six, seven, eight, what the hell are we gonna make? Super team, super team. Yeah, team! We're hot to trot to make our team best. We'll wheel and deal and stop the rest. We'll woo 'em to win 'em and won't give up the fight. We'll bring 'em back to Rambling U if we have to make 'em all night! [DISCO MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISTLING] [WHISTLING CONTINUES] A mission? What kind of mission? Bell Harbor! [ENGINE STRUGGLING] [DISCO MUSIC PLAYING] [GIRLS CHATTERING] [ALL WHOOPING] [ALL LAUGHING] Oh, great. Oh, wow. Let's go. [ALL EXCLAIMING HAPPILY] Ow! Well, girls, how do you like it? SISSY: Dynamite. I love it. SHERYL: Well, it isn't The Waldorf, but it will do. Oh, I love it. This is what I call roughin' it. Yeah, it's like going back to nature. Well, that should about do it. Well, are you ready for the recruits, girls? The question is are they ready for us? [LAUGHS] [BOYS CHATTERING] Damn it, I don't believe it. They've got Stanley Kraus from Alabama U and Bruce Jacobs from UCLA. Let me see. Can you see O.J. Simpson? I don't see Mitch Stevens. Who's he? TONI: Only State U's best player. He played on the all-star team this year. SISSY: Oh, is he cute?MONICA: Mmm, I'll say. What do you think?They could huddle over me any time. Sheryl, she means, how should we approach this? Why not the rear approach? Oh! I like that. You would. Listen, Toni, we can't make it obvious. We've got to make it look casual-like. TONI: That sounds great. But how? MONICA: Damn it. I don't know. Uh-oh, girls, we've got competition. Oh, rats! MONICA: What is it?SISSY: Let me see. SHERYL: Come on, pass the binoculars. MONICA: Toni, what is it?SISSY: Come on. SHERYL: Quit hogging the glasses, will you? SISSY: Hey, come on, it's my turn. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. SISSY: What?SHERYL: What is it, Monica? SISSY: What? Oh, double rats! They're so tiny. Thank you. Well, what's so wrong? Those girls, that's what's wrong. That's Langley's bait. Yeah, and the guys are taking it hook, line and sinker. That's gonna make our work a lot harder, girls. Maybe we can have them eliminated. How? We'll hire a hitman. Oh, sure, what are we gonna pay them with? Maybe they take credit cards. Look, girls, I'm getting hungry. Let's go back to camp. Yeah.You girls go ahead. I'm gonna look around a while. Okay, we'll see you later. Bye, Monica, take care. I could have you arrested as a spy. Oh, I wasn't spying...Oh, yeah? Hey, aren't you Mitch Stevens? Sounds familiar. Yeah, that's who I am. Mitch Stevens. Well, why aren't you out there? Why should I? I'm already recruited. Oh, of course. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm...Don't tell me. You're from Rambling U. And you're a cheerleader. And your name is... Let me think. Your name is... Monica.Monica, that's right. Well, Monica, what are you doing in Bell Harbor? We're just here on vacation. Oh. Who's we? My girlfriends and I, we decided to come here for a few days. Well, do you always travel with these? Oh, I was just checking out the scenery. Yeah, the scenery is pretty lovely from here, isn't it? Have you noticed the curves on the shoreline? You know, and I also really like how the dunes stack up. Yeah. All in all, I'd say it's a beautiful picture. Well, Mitch, it's been nice meeting you, but I have to go now. Hey, why don't we get together sometime? Let's say tonight around 8:00 at the Rat's Nest? The Rat's Nest? What's that? It's just a hangout for the players. Hey, listen, it's a real dive, you'll love it. I'll see you there?

Look, dum-dum, we have to find a way to make that cocktail party a bomb. We don't want our guys to have a good time, now, do we? No, I guess not. Well, why don't we throw our own party instead? Oh, come on. MONICA: Hey, that's a great idea. You mean now? No. I mean Friday night. We'll show our guys what a real party is. Yeah, yeah, that's great.

Yes, indeed. You should be very honored. Pardon me. Punch anyone? Oh, just a little. Do you have any beer?No, dear. I do hope that you boys will be an asset to the university scholastically as well as athletically. [POLITE LAUGHTER] What's in the punch?Absolutely nothing. Well, we're gonna have to fix that.

I'll be right back. I have to speak to Langley. Later.Bye. Tell me, boys, are you finding Bell Harbor enjoyable? Yes, it's just fine. Well, you certainly should. LEE: Yes, it's very nice to be here, ma'am. Isn't this a wonderful old house? MONICA: Brownies anyone? Oh, no, thank you, dear. Try one, they're really good and practically no calories. Well, if you insist. This house has quite a history. And did you boys know it's supposed to be haunted? Mmm! My, these brownies certainly are good, aren't they, boys? [BOYS AGREEING HEARTILY]Well, have another. It seems the original owner was a sea captain, and he returned home one day to find his wife and another gentleman in a most shocking situation. What kind of situation was that, ma'am? What happened next, ma'am? Well, he killed them. That's right, killed them both right upstairs. And they say that even unto this day, his wife and her lover still haunt those rooms. BOYS: Really?Mmm-hmm. Brownies?Yes, thanks. Jesus, you look familiar. What's your name? Uh, Maria. That's it, Maria Gonzalez. Maria, aren't you the girl... No speak English. Adios. Langley, I'm sure they're quite capable, but I cannot give my approval until I personally see them play. But, Dean, their academic records are perfect. Screw their brains, can they play? [STAMMERING] I guarantee it, sir. I cannot accept that. I want to see them play. It's my neck, you know. Well then, how about the day after tomorrow? All right, that's just fine. Young lady. Yes, sir? Another one of those brownies, please. [EXHALES] Mitch Stevens. I can't believe it, damn.

Did you ever consider having yourself committed? Hey, Monica. Oh, God. It's the bionic beauty. Hold the fort, ladies. I'll be right back. [CHUCKLING] Hey, what are they saying? He's saying, [IMITATING NATIVE AMERICAN] "Look, squaw, "you and me go make whoopee in my teepee." Oh, and she's saying, [IN SOUTHERN DRAWL] "Why, Rhett Butler, "I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about." "Don't give me any of your bull, woman. "When sun sets, you me go make much humpum." "Humpum for wampum?" "No wampum, no humpum." [GIRLS LAUGHING] Here she comes. Well, how did it go? I have a date with Mitch. "No humpum for wampum." [ALL LAUGHING] Come on, now, let's get back on the track. What are we gonna do about the guys? Damn it. [SNAPS FINGERS]Come on, Monica. Get with it. And wipe that ghostly smile off your face. Ghostly. Ghostly... Girls, I've got it. [GIRLS CHEERING] [WHISPERING] Come on. SISSY: Wow, this place is really creepy at night. Are you sure this is going to work? I don't know, but Monica said so. That's easy for her to say, she's out on a date with Mitch. Come on, let's move it. I don't want to go. What's wrong now? SISSY: Well, it might really be haunted. Get your hands back on the ladder. SISSY: Well, what if it really is? SHERYL: Listen, you guys, there's no such thing as ghosts. Okay, Sheryl. Move it or lose it. I'm not going to go first. Okay, Sissy, you go. I'm not going. Well, I'm scared. [SIGHS] You chicken shits. All right, follow me. [BOTH EXCLAIMING] [LOUD CLATTERING] [WHIMPERING] Hey, I'm up here, you ninnies. MITCH: What are you thinking about? MONICA: Us.And? And also how I should be thinking about the girls, and how they're doing without me. [GHOSTLY MOANING] What's the matter? [SHUSHING] [WHISPERING] Listen. [WHISPERING] What the hell is that? What the hell you think it sounds like? Sounds like somebody's having a lot of fun. Jesus Christ, it's in stereo. [MOANING CONTINUES] SHERYL: [WAILING] John. Don't ever leave me. Please don't leave me. Holy shit, that must be the captain's wife. Get out of here, there's no such thing as ghosts. [BANGING] Oh, John, that must be the captain. Let me go! [HISSING] [MOANING CONTINUES] Christ, how many wives did he have? Christ, am I scared. What are you scared about? The worst thing that could happen is getting laid by a ghost. Oh, Captain, please don't shoot him. [BOYS EXCLAIMING] [SHERYL SCREAMING] Oh, Captain, don't shoot me. I'll do anything! How could they fall for this shit? [BOYS EXCLAIM] [KNOCKS FOOT AGAINST BED] [GIRLS MOANING] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Right in my own house. [LANGLEY STAMMERING] Get out. And don't come near this house again, do you hear me? We did it. We spooked the traitors. I bet you we scared the shit out of those bastards. Yeah, and we'll go in for the kill at the pom-pom beach party. [EXHALES] You. You. I don't know what moral principles they taught you at Rambling U, but at State U they are high. Gentlemen, I'll see you first thing in the morning. [SCREAMS] [GLASS SHATTERING] [ALL PANTING] Jim? Monica. Okay, bye. Damn, they've been grounded. What? Grounded? What happened? Langley grounded them for having girls in their room last night. Screwed again. And we did it all by ourselves. But what about the party? We'll have a party, and with our guys, too. [SHERYL WHISTLING] [CHUCKLING] Come on. [SHUSHING] Hurry up. Hurry, before we get caught! [STIFLED GIGGLING] Come on. Be quiet, be quiet. [LAUGHING] Hey, Jim, come on. It's party time. [JIM SHUSHING] [FUNK MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Hey, come on, Sheryl. Why don't you leave with me, okay? I'd love to. I'd love to dump every creep here but I can't, I'm one of the hostesses. Hello. Hi. Gosh, I sure would like to get to know you. I'd like to get to know you too, but not now. Maybe later, sweetheart. We're gonna break their asses, once and for all. I'll take care of this with one little phone call. Later? Hey, hey, I heard you girls are dynamite cheerleaders. Why don't you do a cheer for us, huh? How about it? Come on! [ALL CHEERING] All right. How about, "Yeah, team, fight"? [WHOOPING] Okay. Hey. GIRLS: Yeah, team, fight! Yeah, team, fight! Yeah, team! Play, team! Fight! Fight! Fight! All right! [ALL APPLAUDING] He's on his way. BOY: More, more, more. BOYS: [CHANTING] More, more, more. BOY: We want more. We want more. All right.Okay. [HUMMING] [ALL HUMMING] BOY: All right! [BOYS WHOOPING] BOY: Take it off! BOY: All right! All right! [CROWD APPLAUDING] [PLAYING THE HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN] ALL: ♪ There is a house in New Orleans ♪ They call the Rising Sun ♪ And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy ♪ And, God, I know I'm one ♪ They call the Rising Sun ♪ And it's been the ruin... GIRL: Hey, look. Well, boys, as I see it, you have only two choices. You can stay here the rest of your lives satisfying your primitive desires and wallowing in your stupidity, or you can leave instantly, thus transcending this barbaric low life and rising to a higher, more sophisticated class. LANGLEY: Well? And as for you, Mitch, I'm very disappointed in you. You represent the best of State U. How could you allow yourself to be drawn down to their level? Look, Mr. Langley, I resent the attitude you're taking... You resent? Must I remind you that you have signed for next season? And that you will represent State U in the best of light? You had no intention of ever joining. You were just using me. I was trying to tell you all evening. Look, I... I wasn't trying to use you. I really like you, Monica. I want to see you again and again. Well, I don't. I don't like liars. Well, there's nothing else to do, Sissy. It's over. Girls, I've got to tell you something. I've decided to quit the cheerleaders. But why?Oh, Monica, come on. You know we've got a rotten team. Who wants to root for losers? [WHIMPERING] We're going to miss you. C'mon, Sissy, don't take it so hard. I can't help it, everything is going wrong. First we lost the guys, and those mosquitoes were keeping me up all night, it was horrible. What was that? I said everything is going wrong and... No, no. I mean about the mosquitoes? Oh, those damn things were driving me crazy. I was just scratching and itching. Oh, wait, girls, I've got it. MONICA: Hey, what's Phthirus pubis? MITCH: Oh, these little buggers are crabs. [WHISPERING] Right here. I found them. Great, let's get started. Hmm. [GIGGLING] If these boys are as good as you say, it can mean a great box office next season. Hell, box office? What am I talking about? I can get a great contract with the networks. [LAUGHS] 32, 64, 48, hike. [PLAYERS CLAMORING] PLAYER 1: All right! [WHOOPING] All right. Way to go, baby.I can cover him. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Way to go, baby! All right! [INAUDIBLE] PLAYER 2: Hut one, hut two! PLAYER 1: All right! Lee! Set! Hut! Hut! BILL: Yeah! [WHOOPING] PLAYER 2: Way to go! Way to go! Here we go! PLAYER 2: Hut one, hut two! PLAYER 3: Go get him, baby! [ALL SHOUTING] Well, boys, it proves one thing, you can't put a monkey in a suit and expect him to behave like a man. And there's no room for monkeys at State U. And it's obvious that anyone from Rambling U has no moral integrity. Moral integrity? Did you hear that, guys? Moral integrity. Who's the one offering these shady deals? Free scholarships, unreturnable loans, and for what? Because of our IQ's? No, they want a piece of meat that can play ball. So they can raise their revenues. Hell, the way they talk, we don't have to go to class. He's gonna pass us as long as we're good on the field, but one fumble and you're out on your ass. You know what, Mr. Langley? Why don't you take State University and shove it about 10 feet up your ass! [LAUGHS]Hey, is this true? You know it, man.You know it. Mitch... Mitch, don't listen to them. They don't understand football. They think it's just a game. I'll tell you right now, though, it's big business. Now if you're smart, you won't pay any attention to what they're saying. Hey, look, Mr. Langley, I don't think the way you do, and here's your contract. How you doin'? Hey, what's goin' on? Hey, Monica. Do you think I'm acceptable material for Rambling U now? Well, what do you think, girls? Yeah, definitely.Yeah, well done. [ALL CHEERING] MONICA: Okay. All aboard. SHERYL: Come on. Come on, Monica, go.
