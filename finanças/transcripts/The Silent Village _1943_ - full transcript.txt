(Speaks Welsh) (Chatting in Welsh) (Speaks Welsh) This is a special meeting called to discuss the increase in incidents of silicosis in this area. Recently, our secretary Chris attended a delegate conference at which this matter was discussed. I will now call upon Chris to give his report. Chris... Comrade chairman and comrades, I attended a conference last week where the Inspector of Mines outlined a scheme of arresting dust at the point of make, that is the coal face. (♪ Male choir singing) (♪ Military march blaring) (Man on loudspeaker) Achtung! Achtung! (Speaks German) Attention! Attention! To the population of Cwmgiedd! As from today, the districts of Southern and Western Wales stand under the protection of the Greater German Reich. Under a proclamation issued today, the newly appointed Deputy Reich Protector, SS Obergruppenführer Heydrich, calls upon all classes of the people to give their loyal cooperation in the rebirth of your homeland. Continue calmly with your work, and put your trust in the Führer. (♪ Military march plays) (Car passes playing music) Achtung! Achtung! In order to counteract any incidents of an extraordinary nature, the Deputy Reich Protector is entitled to proclaim a civil state of emergency. For the preservation of public order, it is permissible to set aside existing laws. In such cases, the courts martial can pass three alternative sentences. One: the confiscation of property. Two: handing over to the Secret State Police. Three: the death sentence. These powers will be exercised at the sole discretion of the Deputy Reich Protector. Continue your work calmly and put your trust in the Führer. - (Man) Morning. - Morning, Mr Lewis. I've received this morning our clear instructions. Here, you'd better read it. Hmm... "You are therefore instructed "that henceforth no discussions are to take place "between yourself and the men or their representatives." I don't know what my committee will say to that. "The miners' lodges and other similar organisations "are in fact no longer necessary in a National Socialist state." What are you going to do about it, Mr Lewis? - Well, what can we do about it? - I know what my men will do about it. No longer will we have price lists to base our wages on. No longer will you be able to meet as you are meeting this afternoon. As the chairman remarked, the committee have discussed this matter and have come forward with a recommendation. The recommendation is...that we strike! (Cheering) On the recommendation of the committee, can I get a motion? - I move to strike! - I second it! Any against? If not, all in favour please show. Thank you, comrades. (Speaking Welsh) (Barking) (Loudspeaker) Achtung! Achtung! In the course of the last few days, certain events have shown that in spite of the magnanimity proved by the Reich time and again, there are still individuals who persist in disturbing public order, security and the labour peace. (Chickens clucking) Here's Chris coming. - Hello, Chris. How are you? - All right. I think we can start the meeting now, boys. The others can come later. (Loudspeaker) And in the present gigantic struggle for liberation waged by the Greater German Reich, trades unionists and agents of the Jewish-Bolshevik plutocrats and all those who give shelter to such individuals will be considered enemies of the state and treated accordingly. There is only one alternative. To go with the Reich or against it. Those who work against the Reich will be destroyed. (Gunshots) (Machineguns firing) (Firing ceases) (Crows cawing) (Man speaks Welsh) (Speaking Welsh) (Speaks Welsh) (Speaks Welsh) (♪ Choir singing) (Singing in Welsh) (Congregation) Amen. (Wind howling) Children, I have just had a letter to inform me that there is no more Welsh to be spoken in this school. All of our hymns, our beautiful songs, our poems are to be heard no more. But, children, I want you to promise me one thing. Do not forget your Welsh. Speak Welsh at home, on the roadside, at your play, everywhere. Will you promise me not to forget your Welsh language? Yes, Miss Daniel. (♪ Harp music) (♪ Trumpet fanfare) (Music over dialogue) (Man reads in Welsh) "The Nazi beasts have descended upon our pretty village "in a molesting spirit like a plague of locusts." - Where did you get this? - Somebody put it underneath the door. (Man reads in Welsh) (Narrator) What is to be done? Go back to the mine. Work slow. Organise sabotage. Put sand in the machine. Pour water in the oil. (♪ Male choir singing in Welsh) (Gunshot) The conquest of Wales was a very slow process. It started in the reign of William I. Having conquered all England, he turned his attention to Wales, and as Wales was a very mountainous country...

"The woman have been sent to a concentration camp, "and the children have been handed over to the appropriate authorities." "The buildings of the localities have been levelled to the ground. "The name of the community has been obliterated." No, comrades. The Nazis are wrong. The name of the community has not been obliterated. The name of the community has been immortalised. It lives in the hearts of miners the world over. The Nazis only want slave labour! And the miners refused to become slaves. That is why they murdered our comrades in Lidice. That is why we stand in the forefront of the struggle today, because we have the power and the knowledge and the understanding to hasten the coming of victory! To liberate oppressed humanity. To make certain there shall be no more Lidices. And then the men of Lidice will not have died in vain. (♪ Choir singing)
