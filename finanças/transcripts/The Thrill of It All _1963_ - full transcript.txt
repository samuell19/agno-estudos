[ Announcer On TV ] BEFORE JOINING THE THIRD ACT OFHAPPY PLAYHOUSE, HERE IS A BRIEF WORD FROM OUR HAPPY GIRL. HI! I'M SPOT CHECKER. I'VE JUST BEEN SIGNED TO APPEAR IN A MOTION PICTURE. OF COURSE, IT'S JUST A SMALL PART. BUT ALL THE GLAMOROUS MOVIE STARS STARTED OUT BY PLAYING SMALL PARTS. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS A GIRL MUST LEARN... BEFORE SHE CAN BECOME A GLAMOROUS MOVIE STAR. FIRST OF ALL, SHE HAS TO LEARN WHAT CLOTHES TO WEAR... AND WHAT HAIRSTYLE, OH, AND HOW TO ACT. A FAMOUS STAR ONCE SAID TO ME, "SPOT," SHE SAID, "IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT YOU LOOK LIKE A STAR OR ACT LIKE A STAR. YOU MUST SMELL LIKE A STAR." SO IT WAS THERE AND THEN THAT I LEARNED ABOUT... "HAPPY SOAP," THE HEAVENLY SOAP. IT SMELLS LIKE STARS. [ Spot Clearing Throat ] WON'T YOU JOIN ME... [ Water Rippling ] AND FIND TRUE HAPPINESS IN YOUR BATH? JUST YOU AND A CAKE OF HAPPY. [ Giggles ] COULDN'T SELL ME A CAKE OF THAT SOAP. THAT SOAP SAVED MY LIFE TODAY. WHO SAID THAT? PUT THE DARN LIGHTS ON! NOW WHO SAID THAT? WELL, I GUESS I DID. WHO ARE YOU? SHE'S WITH ME, SIR. FATHER, THIS IS DR. BOYER AND HIS WIFE. DR. BOYER'S MY OBSTETRICIAN. OH, YEAH! NICE GOIN', DOC. NOW, YOUNG LADY, WHAT THE DEVIL DID YOU MEAN, "THAT SOAP SAVED MY LIFE TODAY"? IT WAS JUST A FIGURE OF SPEECH, MR. FRALEIGH. HOW IN TARNATION CAN A SOAP SAVE YOUR LIFE? MAYBE I PUT IT TOO STRONGLY, BUT IF IT WEREN'T FOR HAPPY SOAP, I'D STILL BE IN A HASSLE WITH MY DAUGHTER. - HOW'S THAT? - YOU REALLY WANT TO HEAR THIS? YEAH. GO ON! WELL, UM, FOR YEARS, I'VE BEEN SHAMPOOING... MY DAUGHTER MAGGIE'S HAIR WITH A PINE TAR SHAMPOO. HUH? WITH A PINE TAR SHAMPOO. TODAY SHE REFUSED TO LET ME. WHY? BECAUSE SHE SAID THE SHAMPOO SMELLED LIKE THE CRACKS IN THE SCHOOLYARD. SMELLED LIKE WHAT? SHUT UP, SHUT UP! GO ON, GO ON! WELL, SHE JUST REFUSED TO LET ME WASH HER HAIR. HEAVEN KNOWS SHE NEEDED IT, BECAUSE HER BROTHER ANDREW HIT HER IN THE HEAD WITH A MUD BALL. - HA! - WHY, THAT LITTLE SON OF A GUN. BECAUSE SHE HIT HIM WITH ONE FIRST RIGHT IN THE MOUTH. HA, HA! MUD BALL, RIGHT IN THE MOUTH. GO ON! OH, WELL, SHE, UH, UH, FINALLY AGREED TO LET ME WASH HER HAIR. BUT ONLY IF I WOULD USE HAPPY SOAP. SO I DID, AND SHE JUST LOVED IT. SHE SAID THAT IT MADE HER SMELL LIKE HER PIANO TEACHER. HEAR THAT? THEN HER BROTHER ANDREW INSISTED THAT I WASH HIS HAIR WITH HAPPY SOAP. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT. MUD BALLS IN THE MOUTH! LITTLE KIDS THAT LIKE TO SMELL LIKE THEIR PIANO TEACHER. NOW, DAD, YOU SHOULDN'T BE GETTING EXCITED. SHOULDN'T BE GETTING EXCITED? THAT'S THE DAMN TROUBLE WITH YOU YOUNG'UNS. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN TO GET EXCITED. YOU SHOULD BE SHOUTIN' INSTEAD OF ME. I SHOULD? DARN RIGHT. SUPPOSED TO BE IN ADVERTISING. DON'T EVEN KNOW WHEN TO SHOUT. FATHER, PLEASE, WE HAVE GUESTS.

BECAUSE I MANUFACTURE HAPPY SOAP, AND I THINK YOU CAN SELL IT. BUT, SIR, WHAT'S WRONG WITH SPOT CHECKER? WE'VE WORKED SO CLOSELY WITH HER. I KNOW HOW CLOSELY YOU WORK. I THOUGHT SPOT INVITING PEOPLE TO JOIN HER IN HER BATH WAS VERY EFFECTIVE. MAYBE THEY'RE BATHING WITH HER, BUT THEY SURE AS HECK AREN'T USING HAPPY SOAP. I LIKE YOU. HAVE A NUT. WHAT YOU SAID IS WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR ON THE TV. NEVER DID LIKE THEM SKINNY STARLINGS. "LETS," DAD. LET'S WHAT? STARLETS, NOT STARLINGS. - OH, SHUT UP! - FATHER, MUST YOU? YEP.
