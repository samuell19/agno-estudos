Angus Scattergood. [radio DJ] And we have the rock legend himself on the phone right now. {gasps} - Angus, always a thrill. [Angus] Well, if you get the thrill, then everyone's thrilled. [radio DJ] So how's your new single coming along? [Angus] New single is good. - Uh, just on the last tweaks. - Mm-hmm. And... and I'm trying just to get back to my roots. You know, back to where it all started. [radio DJ] Where did it all start? [Angus] I got my first six-string guitar when I was a small cat. [grunts] [metallic clang] [Angus] And I got on there and the music came out, and the words, you know... [guitar strings resonating] Once I started, there was no going back. You know, I was just hooked, really. [guitar music playing] [guitar music playing] So then I came down to the city to Rock 'n' Roll Park, 'cause you know these musicians have taken the whole thing over, mate. And I found a band there in need of a guitar, and then the rest is history. History and geography and a little bit of mathematics. [radio DJ] Amazing. So any advice for up and coming musicians? [Angus] Play your guts out and... and never stop. Even when your dad says, "Stop!" Don't stop. [humming softly] - Dad? - Hmm-mmm. Got some great news for you. - Got some fabulous news. - Mm-hmm. I've decided to become a musician. [gasps] What. Where'd you... Did you break into the... [groans] My son, the thief. I... I know. I'm sorry, but see, there's this guy named Angus! And he was telling me about Rock 'n' Roll Park, and finding my band. And it was, like, the answer to the question of my life, Dad! - Do you understand? - Now I'm gonna have to get a new lock. Like those things grow on trees around here. If you could feel what I'm feeling. Here. [guitar music playing] Stop that. Now. Bodi. That's enough. Hand it over. Give me the... - [grunting] - Bodi! Give me that! Give me... Come here! [objects clattering] Hand it to me! [grunting] [guitar music continues] [door closes] You're not gonna be a musician, Bodi! You're gonna be a guard.

[Angus] Did you say music teacher? - [Bodi] Yes, sir. - [Angus] Is this... Just hang on a moment. [Angus laughing in the distance] We've just got news through my headpiece here that Mr. Scattergood would love nothing more than to be your music teacher. [laughs] What? That... That is incredible.

Don't you understand what "incognito" means? Um, just a button. Wasn't a penny. Sorry about that, Mr. Scattergood. Don't use the name! Just make me enough for a cab fare, all right? [Bodi] Sure thing, got it. [guitar music playing] [horn honking] [Riff] Bingo! We got him this time. Come on, Skozz, let's go pull around the back. Woo-hoo-hoo! All right, how much have you made so far? Just a button. Just a button? Yep. One button. It's a good start, though. Give me that swamp fiddle thing. [tunes guitar] [guitar playing] Can you give me a bit of space here? - Oh. - Just back up a bit. - How's this? - [Angus] Bit further. - Okay, how 'bout now? - Another 20 steps back. Get in the hedge. [Bodi] I can't see you! Perfect! Second time's a charm! [Laughs] - [Darma] Bodi'? - Oh, hey, Darma. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. I've just been, uh, hanging out with Mr. Scattergood. Whoa, whoa! Sorry. Back up. You've been hanging with rock legend, Angus Scattergood? - Uh, yup. - [Germur] Right on. - Hanging with Angus. - He was not hanging. Hangus with Angus. Really. We've been together all day. Let's see... We went jogging- - Then we had some pizza. - [Darma] Right. - [Angus yelling] ...hey! Come on! - Then we came here to the park 'cause, you know, he needs a little money for a cab. - Of course. - [Angus] Help me! Help me! He's right over there. You guys want to meet him? Yeah. Yeah, we do. Yes, that's a great idea. Let's all just go meet Angus! - Sweet! We're meeting Angus! - Don't get your hopes up. [yelling] Oi! You big twit. Hey! What's going on... [yells] And here he is, Mr... Mr. Scattergood? Woo-wee! We did it! We did it! He was right here. I don't know what happened. I don't know where he went. - I believe you, dog. - You do? I do what? What do I do? Look, Bodi, you know, you don't have to make stuff up to impress us. What? No, no. He was right here. I gotta find him. Mr. Scattergood! Where are you? - Mr. Scattergood! Hey! Where'd you go? - Oh... - He's cute. - [Bodi] We wanted to hangus! Completely delusional, but cute. [tires screeching] Boom! Mission accomplished! Hmm... [wolves chuckling] [Linnux laughing] You got the goods? - We got the goods. - [laughing] [snarling] You kidnapped Angus flipping Scattergood? Angus... flip... What? He grabbed the guy! You didn't even get the right species! [wolf] Riff, don't you know the difference? [Linnux] Is it that tough? [wolves chattering indistinctly] - [wolf 2] What do you expect from Riff? - [whistles] Shut up! Just shut up! Who's in charge here? You? Large lad? I will call you... "Large Lad." You stupid, bloody idiot, you know who I am? You're in a lot of trouble, mate. And the entire world is going to be beating down your door like... like salmon trying to go up a... a stream when it's mating season. Not a good analogy. Anyway. Look, just... [thumps] You know what? You two morons just lost your health plan. And your 401 Ks. And if you don't bring in that mastiff by the end of the week, I'm relocating you to new digs with bottom-of-the-oceanfront views. - Am I clear? - Bottom of the oceanfront, got it. Now get outta my sight. Give Mr. Scattergood a ride home. Ooh! When I get ahold of your kid, you're not going to know what hit you. - [indistinct chatter] - What the... - I know that was you, Feng! - [Feng] Sorry. Ethel, the headpiece goes on last so you can see what you're doing. Come on. Guys, we've been through this. No. I... I... I think that's... I think that's a foreleg you have on your hind leg there, Steve. - It's a left. - [Steve] This one? The one... Left. - No. The other left. - Oh. This one? - Oh, my goodness. Hey, Phil. Phil! - [grunting] Stop distracting Carl. He's trying to get dressed. Wait a minute. Carl, will you get out of the shower? - [Carl] But... But I like it in here. - I don't care, Carl. - It's time to go to work. - [gargling] Come on, you're wasting time. And water. [Grunts] [groans] We... Are... Are you even capable of holding still? [sheep 2] Why isn't Bodi here? For the nine billionth time, he went to the city. - [all] What? - When did this happen? Do you really not remember? You gave him a going away party, for crying out loud. [sheep group agreeing] - When's he coming back? - [groans] Uh... I wish I knew. [engine revving] [Angus] on! [groaning] You know what kind of a fool you made me look like back there? Hmm? We supposed to be a team, Skozz. We supposed to be a team. I know you hear me. I know you hear me sayin' words, you just trying to ignore me. And I know you understand what... You playin' a video game when I'm trying to... Gimme that old video game! [video game beeping] [horn honking] [tires screeching] [both grunting] [truck beeping] [both screaming] - Yeah! Whoo! - Sweet! Put your seatbelt on, Skozz! [Riff] You can't just be doin' whatever you want all willy-nilly. You got to do what I say. This is my last shot at getting in good with Linnux. And you got to help me. You got anything to say? [notes playing Off-Key] [phone ringing] Ozzy! [Exhales deeply] Take a message, will you? [Ian over phone] Hello? "'Angus?" Nd.! Angus! 'Angus! {grunts} What? [Ian] Okay, where is it, Angus? I need more time, Ian. I just... I need... I was just kidnapped. - You were not. - I was! - They hoovered me over a wall. - [lan] Really? They hit me with bats! Not flying bats, but the... [Ian] Oh, will you quit making lame excuses and just get the song to us? These are some of the best excuses I've ever had! - Just don't... Don't make me beg. - [lan] I'm not making you beg. - Give me a bit more time... - We already have. - Just a little bit more time... - Tomorrow, 6:00 p.m. sharp! Bye. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! [notes playing off-key] [singing in a distance] ♪ I'm so stuck in this garbage truck I' ♪ That I can't even get myself out a' [Angus] Oh... That... is not... actually awful. It's...

Yeah, it's me! Where ya been? - Whoo-hoo-hoo! [Grunts] - [Angus] Welcome. Welcome, welcome. - Uh, Bo... Bodee? Bohdee? - Bodi, yes! - Bodi! - I can't believe you remember my name. [laughs] I can't either, mate. Now, what was it you were after? - Music lessons, yeah? - Yes. Come. Come on in, mate. Don't step on the welcome mat. And don't touch the door, it's electrified. - This is Ozzy. - Wow! - Yeah, just... Wait. - Oh, wow! Just leave the robot alone for the moment. Hello, Ozzy! My name is Bodi! That's it... That's it, mate. So, music lessons? [BOdi] Wow! Boy, I've... I've never seen anything like this. My... My whole village could fit in here. [Angus] Yeah, yeah, it could, mate. Yeah. What's that? That's my old tour bus. I've been to the moon and back in that thing. And here is... Here is the library... [BOdi] Whoa! - Yeah. - Mr. Scattergood. Indeedyweedy, mate. You want to be a rock musician? You've got to have the proper ax. Just go ahead, pick one. Any one. Oh! [etherial music] Wait! Don't... Don't touch. You see, that is a Scattercaster, you see? Only one in the entire universe. Crafted by Celtish people from the timbers of a Viking ship and presented to Saxons by the Romans, I think it was. - Wow! - So not that one. - Okay. How... How 'bout that one? - No, no. Not that one. - Well, this one I like... - No, no. Not that one. Okay. Well, I like the color of this one... No, no. Just... I lost the keys to that one. Ah! [grunts] [objects clattering] What about this one? It makes you look like a rock star. So what do we learn first? Chords? Fingering? Strumming techniques? That's boring stuff. Really, to be honest, boring. I'll teach you that later in the lesson. Necessary, but boring. Best to start off with songwriting. Have you ever composed? I have this one little something about a garbage truck. Can you play it? Yeah, I can give it a shot. [guitar music playing] [Bodi off-key] ♪ I'm so stuck in this garbage truck I' ♪ I just wanna get myself out a' Wait... That's good. But stop it for the moment. Ah... Waste management, mate. It's not very rock 'n' roll is it, you see? Pardon me? You've got to write something that's going to resonate with the masses. You mean, like, something that makes people feel good. Yes! So reach inside yourself... Wh... where did you come from, mate'? - My... my town's called Snow Mountain. - [Angus] What's that make you feel like? Uh... What's the word? Uh... - Disgusted? - No... - Uh, entrapped? - Not really. - Angry? Bitter? - Uh... - Judgmental? - Not quite. - One horse? - No. - Anti-cat? - I got it! Glorious. Glorious? Yeah. That'll do. [guitar music playing] [piano music playing] [beat fades in] [rock music playing] [clanging] [electric guitar music playing] [inaudible] [shockwave] [Ozzy exclaims] [window shatters. Rock and roll, mate! [panting] I... I can't believe I did that. Yeah, you were on fire! That's what you were. You were totally on fire! You were in the zone! - Did you feel it? - I did feel it! I felt it. I felt it... You blew up my room! You blew up my room! I'm sorry, Mr. Scattergood! It doesn't matter. It does not matter. Nothing to worry about, all right? The song... is done. It is done. [Bodi] So, that's the lesson? [Angus] Yeah it is. [laughing] Why, it's one of the best I've ever given. Watch the welcome mat. There you go. So when should I come back? [flaps lips] Is that... For our second lesson? Is tomorrow good? Why, um... that's gonna be... It's tricky, uh, really slammed stuff, you know, on the calendar-wise, you know. But we, we could... I'll get my people to... But, you know, we'll work out something. Okay. Well, I guess I'll just go over to the park. Great, great, mate. Just, uh... [beeping] Hurry up before the hedge pops up... There you go, mate! Mind the mice! Okay! Well, goodbye! 'Bye then! [Bodi] Bye, Ozzy! [Angus mumbles indistinctly] - See you soon! - [Angus mumbles indistinctly] [Igrunting, panting] Whoo-hoo! Guys, you're not gonna believe this. You're not gonna believe it! Mr. Scattergood gave me a music lesson! And we wrote a song together! - He even let... - [Germur] Whoa! Hey... - [radioDJ] On the line, right now, - He's on! He's on! [radio DJ over radio] Angus, tell us... Tell us about your new single. [Angus over radio] It's been a long time coming, and everyone's been saying, "When's it coming?" And here it is, baby, out tomorrow. And it is called "Glorious." Yeah, "Glorious!" - That's the song we did! - [rock park musicians] Shh. Shh. Quiet! [radio DJ] So, uh, what inspired you? [Angus] Uh, well, funny story. I was sitting in my studio and the bell rang. - Yep. That was me. - [Angus] Which almost never happens. I go to the door and there was nobody there. What? [Angus] But I looked up, and I thought of where I grew up. Up in the mountains where... Uh, where the snows are. And I thought, "This is glorious, mate. It's just glorious." And it came-came straight from the heart. From, uh, my heart, to be clear. That was from my heart. [radio DJ] That's beautiful. [Angus] Well, I 'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge someone who was there for me, and without whom this song would not have been written. And that person of course is my butler, Ozzy. And he, in his own way, he is glorious. Or not glorious. What's a better word for it? Square-shaped. [Stereo clicks] Uh, he didn't mention you. Why not? Oh, that's right 'cause the dude doesn't know you exist! [rock park musicians laughing] II' Bodi... Hey, you should really get out of the rain. Germy and I are gonna grab some noodles. You want to come? [Germur] I believe you, dog. - [lan over phone] Hello? - [Angus] Ian'? '[lafi] Yeah? {AHQUS} Ian? - Angus, what is it now? - [Angus] Ian, mate? Can you hear this? [Ian] What is it now? - [Angus] Can you hear that? - [lan] Yeah, what is that? What is that? - It's finished. - [lan] The song... The song's finished? - Two hours to spare. - [lan] Yes! Okay, don't move. I'm going to send a runner over right away. We're going to pick it up. We're going to have a big party tonight! - I'm going to rent us a hotel, okay? - Yeah, make it two hotels, okay? - [lan] That's really not in our budget... - Yeah, ginormous party, all right. - We can't do that... Angus? - All right, cheers, mate. [exhales deeply] What? Why are you looking at me like that? Is this about that daft dog? Come on, he'll be fine. He'll be fine! Look, truth is, I could've written that song without that dog. All right, I could not have written that song without that dog. But... It's not like I can go around telling people the truth. I'd lose it all, man. I'd lose the legend... Maybe I should give him a little something, for the inspiration, yeah? Is that a good idea? Will you stop! You're like a stone, you are! You stare at me with your big, tin eyes and your big, tin face. You tin thing! Ozzy! That tin can. Blackmail! It's not blackmail, is it, technically. It's a... it's a guilt trip. Guilt trip! That's what it is. [guitar music playing] [vehicle approaching] [engine revs] Oh! [Grunts] [Riff laughing] We got you! [panting] [tires screeching] [lasers powering up] [9 Fu nts] [gasps] [breathing heavily] [9 Fu nts] Buncha idiots. [cell phone ringing] - Hey, Boss! - Did you get him? Yeah, I got him! I got him right here! Everyone okay? Yeah, yeah, um, everybody is good! Don't you worry 'bout nothin'. I am on top of... [Linnux] Riff? Riff, you there? Oh, you better not have hung up on me! Wakey, wakey. Have a nice nap? Whoa. Let's hear all about your pop's army. How many troops? How many lines of defense? What's their combat effectiveness? Sir, if my dad knew that I was talking to a wolf... [chuckles] Oh, boy... Mum's the word, huh? [Chuckles] You got nothing to say? Okay. Okay. [9 Fu nts] [objects clattering] Not gonna talk about... [yawns] the sheep army. [Linnux] Sheep army? Sheep army. Sheep army. Sheep army. [gasps] Sheep army. [laughs] [scattered laughter] - I can't thank you enough! - W... what's that? - Okay, fellas. Start packing. - Where we going, Chief? - Oh, a little place called Snow Mountain. - Oh! Wait a second. [Clears throat] You... you don't need to go to Snow Mountain. - Oh, yes, we do. - No, really. We certainly do. - You don't need to bother them, so- - Zip it! Put him in the ring with The Grizz. Wamwfi Bean? - [Germur] Bodi! - [Darma] Bodi! - [Germ~r1Y~ hungry, bro? - [Darma] BQdi? Bode! Where could he possibly have gone? Hmm. If I were the Bode... Ooh. Back up. There was a car here earlier. I think that's a good conclusion. Whoa. Check it. What? Why would anybody go after Bodi? Mys't9l'Y- [horn honking] - You seein' what I'm seein'? - I think so. Does it start with an "A"? Yes. And end with a "good"? Yes. You there! Have you seen a dog around here? Silly hat, bit of a goof? You... know... Bodi? Yes, that's his name. He's, uh, kind of like a... Bit of a muse, really. Hello. Large Lad. [phone ringing] Hold this, will you? - What? Yeah. - Angus! Where are you? Our runner is waiting outside your place right now and you're not answering! - I've. .. - And I don't want any more games! This is getting really, really old. Now you've got exactly one minute to come outside and hand over that record or your career is over! - You understand? - Ian. - What? - Something's come up. I've gotta do this. [phone beeps] Come on! What are you waiting for? Let's go find your mate. Who? Us? [grunts] Germur, come on! C0min'! [Grunts] [loud cheering] II' [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, for your own safety, please give a warm welcome to The Grizz! Oh, boy... [rumbling] [gasps] Dog. Food. [growls] Okay, boys, you know the drill. Last one breathing wins. Please, sir, my family's in danger. Can we just cancel this whole thing? I'm not really even a fighter. I'm not really a referee. Now get some! [whoops] [animal] Crush him! [cheering] [Grizz laughing] [Grizz growls] [crowd cheers] II' [horn honking] - Bodi! - Dog! - Thank goodness we found you! - Man, where you been? We've been looking everywhere for you. So... You're okay. Right. Can I drop you somewhere? - Snow Mountain! - You've gotta be kidding me! Please, listen to me. Wolves... They're gonna eat the village! Wolves? [Groans] Don't like them. I'll do it. All right. Come on! What the! There you go. Just a little something from me, all right? From me to you. Just signed the back of it, you see? That makes it more valuable. Ozzy normally does that, but I've done that to make it real. You know? It's valuable. Valuable! It's valuable. - [Khampa] No. Your head is on backwards. - [sheep chattering indistincly] Ethel, move it! Move it! Move it! Where is Carl? Is he in the shower again? - [sheep] He is. - [Khampa] ...fine. Let's go. It's like you're a bunch of kindergartners! How Bodi put up with you for this long, I do not... Oh, great. This is not a drill. Take your positions! Those are not the positions I meant. [laughter] Who wants a taste? Come on! Anyone? Bring it! What the... [chuckles] All right, boys. Break 'em out. [panting] [door opens] Carl? Carl! Down here. I can't believe I'm saying this, but you're our only hope. Go warn the village. [wolves chattering indisitncly] So we meet again. Bring him along. [clamoring] Hurry! Hurry! Come on! No, this way! In here! Okay, bar the doors! [straining] [Riff] Hello? [Lock rattling] Hello? I've got to have you open this door. No, not this time you don't! [chuckles] Oh... [ h _BOO! ' S eep Screaming] [bleats] {WON-TI yea_ "[9r0wls]" Don't spare the hot sauce, and keep them turning. You know, nothing goes better with lamb chops than a little mint jelly. Let's grill! [straining] [blowing] - [bleats] - [Bodi] Stop! Bodi? - [sheep chattering excitedly] - Where'd you come from? Let everyone go! Or else what? Or else this. Bodi, what... What are you doing? No, no, Dad. It's okay. I found the fire. I found it. Ah. - Grab him! - This way! [wolves growling] [Bodi panting] Don't you touch my son! Bodi, run! We gotta help him. Relax, I got a plan! [tour bus engine revving] [all shouting] What? That was your plan? You complete and utter goat! [Khampa p8ntin9] What? II' [wolves] Get back here. [panting] Whoa! - Get back here. - Get back! [Khampa grunting] [panting] [wolves] There he is! [wolves groaning] [Riff] No, he ain't gonna... Whoa! [Thuds] [laughter] [gasps] Cut him down. You know what? I left my switchblade in the car, so... [wolf laughing maniacally] Bodi. Now, about that fire? This would be a good time. [guitar music playing] [shockwave] [shockwave] [shockwave] [shockwave] [shockwave] [stops strumming] [Linnux grunting] [shockwave] [Linnux screaming] I love you, son. Well played, mate. - Angus! - [Angus exclaims] - [Darma] Bodi! - All right, Bodi! - [sheep 1] That was incredible. - [sheep 2] That's how you shred! Oh, don't worry about me. They'll untie me sooner or later. My guess is later. The important thing is what's going on right there. Yeah, it's only worked one other time!
