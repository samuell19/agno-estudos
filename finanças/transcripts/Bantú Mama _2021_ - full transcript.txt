Next stop: Marcouville Line 43, destination Osny, Les Patis… Hey, what's up? Hey, Emma. What? -Emma. -What? -Where are you going? -Where do you think? Stay with us a little while. I'll pass by later, okay? Yeah, right. There you go. You're just being fussy. Coco… I'm leaving. Be good. See you next week. Here's the wristband that will grant you access to all of the services we offer on the resort until 1 am. It's a pleasure to welcome you. Have a great vacation. Thank you. That's a beautiful song. Yes, it's a song from where I'm from. Have you lived here a long time? I've been here for twelve years. And you? Where are you from? From France… and from Cameroon. I would love to go to Africa one day. Me too. Hello? Yes. I don't understand. We said in a week. No, no problem. I'll see you in the lobby. Okay, bye. Are you almost done? It's okay, I'll take care of it. Get in the car, I got this. Thank you. -Hello. -Good afternoon. Great, thanks. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Passport, please. Emanuela? Emmanuelle. Are you traveling by yourself? Has your luggage been with you at all times? Yes. You haven't been given any packages by a stranger, to carry to your final destination? No. Tell me about this. It's narcotics. Is this yours? What about the suitcase, is it yours? -The suitcase is mine. -The suitcase, yes, so the drugs…? No. If it's in your suitcase, it's yours. So explain. You need to help us. Come on, help us. Listen carefully. I know what you did around my area. I don't want to see around again. I'm telling you. Same goes for you. I'll slap both of you. Hey, kid! Squash it, let's go… Now you know. Help! Help! Help! -Stop! -Help! Fuck. What a mess! Come on, help me out. What happened to you? What's your name? What happened? Let's take her with us! -Where? -Home. -Help me! -Yes, okay! We need to get her some water. What kind of mess have you got yourself into? You gonna start fucking around? Are you Haitian? She doesn't look Haitian. What did you do? Did you kill someone? Are you nuts? We have to take that off. Is there a bolt-cutter here? Well… You'll tell me later. Yo, does this work? I think so. Who else lives here? Just the three of us. -Don't you have parents? -No. My father is in jail and my mom died. Cuki, come here! You eat this? Of course, she will. Sit straight. -What do you call this? -Frito verde. We eat this too, when it's ripe. It's called aloko. We eat that here too, frito maduro. PLEASE RING THE BELL What are you waiting for? Here come the pigs! Run! What's going on? Don't worry, they already took what they wanted. What did they take? My dad. Is Cameroon in Haiti? No. Cameroon is a different country, on the other side of the Atlantic. In Africa. Like those guys I saw on TV, jumping like this. The Maasai jump like that. I'm Bantu. How can you be Bantu and French? One doesn't exclude the other. Show me your dance again. What's happening here? Honoring the Maasai. The what? The Maasai, a tribe from Kenya. Show me! Let's do it like the Maasai. How is it? Come on, Emma! Anyone would think it's just a piece of cloth on your head. But… depending on the way you wear it, it can mean different things. My hair is a mess. Or… I want to be seen… just as I am. Powerful. With my crown. Like a queen. -How much for this? -Fifty. -Everything is at fifty? -Yes. That's lovely. -You like it? -Yes. It looks great on you. LAWYER LEGAL SERVICES Hey! Tell me. I… got into a business… …that went bad. I think they're looking for me. I don't want to get caught here. I'd like to go back to France. Can someone send you a birth certificate? I can get one. I don't know, I could… …send you to Guadalupe or any other French island in the Caribbean. Listen… It's not that easy. But we can figure it out. There's always a way. This little job will cost you 500.000 pesos. -How much? -Half a million pesos. We don't have that here, bring it down. Who knows better? You or me? Both, but I know better. I'm the one with the money. No, 500.000 or no deal. You want me to call my dad? Tell me, should I call him? We can get 400.000, and that's it. Okay, I'll take it. 400.000 pesos. One thing, don't you dare to go outside. You see? We're moving forward already. Come here. That's a lot of money. Do you have someone who could send that money? No, I have no one. Nobody knows I'm here, and I don't want anyone to know. If you help me, I'll help you. What do you mean? Take my little brother with you. This neighborhood is a mess. I'll find a solution. I… No, no, no. I have enough problems already. I don't want any more. If you help me, I'll help you. "Capotillo: the most dangerous neighborhood in Santo Domingo." You slice them like that. Very thin. Who taught you how to cook? My mother, when I was young. We cooked these a lot at home. Just onions? Can you buy me tomatoes and rice, please? There's always rice here. I'll go and buy the tomatoes. Bye. Talk to you later, bro. What's up, family? You're cooking and everything? What's your tribe called again? Maasai? -Bantu. -Bantu? Gourmet cuisine! What's up? What are you doing? Try with this. I don't feel it with that track. This one is for dancing and have a good time. True. How do you dance to this? Not like that! -Show me how you do it. -You have to move more! How? I don't know… Look at this move… No… She's French. We're helping her with something. But she's not an issue. She helps a lot in the house. But she's leaving soon. Of course, I'll take care of it. Tina? She's doing good. All good, they're both doing good. Sure, that's ready, I'm in contact with them. Sure, whatever you say is an order. You're the boss. Blessings, Uncle. Wow, you're such an ass-kisser! There's a lot missing. Yeah, but there's enough to start. You're such a pain. You just need to focus on doing your job. I'll get the money. I don't want trouble with your father. Forget about it, I'm in charge. Hey, let's go? So, how much is he asking for? Nothing that's out of my reach. Don't get into trouble, okay? Chill, my money is mine. You like that kind of shit? They say she's French. -You know her? -What's up with her? She jumped into the river to escape. If she's alive, she's in the neighborhood. Tell me, you saw her? No, I've never seen her. Never mind, see you later. NATIONAL POLICE He's a big guy already. Okay, let's do something nice. Okay. What's this? You guys went to the barber's? Yes. -Do you like it? -No. Why did you do this to him? It's a nice design, can't you see? -He doesn't like it. -What do you mean? What do you know about what he likes? Because he says so. You want to be a tiger or a pussy? He can be whatever he wants. It's nothing to do with you. I'm the one in charge of him. And you're leaving soon. Understand? I'm the one struggling for him. He'll be a tiger, as I say. You'll be a tiger. And that's the end of it. You must be out of your mind. Listen… You don't have to be a tiger, you hear me? Stop, stop! I told you to stop! Where are you going? I'm going home. Where are your papers? At home. You should have them with you. And your ID? -At home. -Come on, take her. Wait, I have them home! I can go and get them. Move, move! Come on! Get in! How are you doing, boss? She's a friend of mine. -Who? -The light-skinned one. She has no papers. Maybe we can do something, boss? What do you mean by "something"? Take this. Come on, do me this favor. -This one? -Yes. Take her. Come on, hurry up. I told you not to leave the house! You think it's a joke? Cuki? Cuki? You don't know her. You don't even know what she did. Drop it. Kick her out, man. It's not like that, bro. Okay. I'm just telling you, they're looking for her. Keep that in mind. I think they're here. They're here. Blessings, Uncle. The deal is wrapped up. All good. It's all in the safe. Done. You can sleep easy tonight, for sure. Blessings. One more. Look at me. Perfect. Hello! Hello. How's everything around here? Fine. -A "chin" of water? -Excuse me? A little bit of water? Thanks for the water. See you. "It was a beautiful, starry night. "They were two people admiring the sky full… of stars and the moon was shining." -"More than anything…" -Carry on. You're doing good. "and it was all…" -Today is the day. -The day? You're leaving. Wait for me where I told you. I'll be there in a while. Tina? I love you. You have to go now. With him. Tina… I can't. I don't even know how this is going to end. I know. Bad. You can save him. This place is fucked up. He deserves a real life. You have to go, now. Thank you. -Goodbye. -Have a nice day, lady. Subtitles edited by Lucie Maguire
