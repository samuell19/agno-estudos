Hello, Flood. Frank. Is it that late? I left after the third race. One of those days, huh? Yeah. Two grand. Moshe Saino said the horse couldn't lose. I don't like Moshe. I wasn't there. Have a drink. Thanks. Kay, want a drink? Flood? That's right, you don't touch it until after five o'clock. Flood, I am clean. Is that supposed to be funny? Cleaned out. Six weeks ago you had enough to last the year out. That was six weeks ago. We'd better go back to work. Nah, I'm here for a rest. Being polite to suckers takes it out of me. Maybe you didn't hear me right. Okay, pal. I'll stake you but stretch it, huh. This is an expensive town. We'd better go back to work. What would you say if I told you how to pick up a million dollars? You'd better lay off the booze Frank if one drink does that to you. One million dollars. Cash. Frank. You know I don't like jokes about money. Anything else, but not money. I'm not joking. I first got the idea when I was in the marines at Camp Pendleton. How they pay you on the first and the fifteenth of each month. They bring the cash in the day before from L.A. Now pay-day falls on a Monday. And they hold the money in the bank over the weekend. At Pendleton? No, San Felipe. A good man could take that safe with a can-opener. No. Banks aren't in our line, Frank. The only time I ever saw you loaded you gabbed about a bank. Yes. I must have been really fractured. - You sure were. I pulled just one bank job. Something went wrong. I drew five years. That's that. It's one thing to peddle phony mines and stocks but a bank means guns. And Nitro. Strong-arm men. It's a million dollars, Flood. - I'm not interested. I've leased this place for a year. I'm going to relax and enjoy myself. A lousy 2-bit bank. I said forget it. It is across the street. Today there is 20,000 men in Camp Pendleton. Say the average G.I. marine gets a hundred dollars a month. And he gets paid on the first and the fifteenth of each month. A million bucks in that bank every pay-day? That's right. New bills? - Some new, some old. None of this keeping track of the numbers stuff. And mostly in small bills. How come nobody ever thought of it before? There is a first time for everything. There is the first time for seeing the inside of a Pen' too. Not the way you lay it out. Come on. Now don't con me, buddy. But you are thinking about it. If we pull a trick like this we got it made. Alcatraz is full of guys who said that. What do you think about it, Kay? - Leave her out of it. I can ask, can't I? You heard the man. A million dollars sits in a 2-bit safe and they sit there like it was nothing. I was just a kid when I pulled that bank job. I didn't know any better. I don't like being shot at. Well, who does? The way it is now a few wise-guys with larceny in their hearts .. Blow their bankrolls to me but nobody gets hurt. I know what I am up against. I don't make any mistakes. That's why I can afford to relax. Well I can't. Look, Flood. You got all the connections. You know the specialists from the old days. Guys at the top of their trade like we are to ours. Now maybe this won't work, but it's worth thinking about. That's all I'm asking you to do. Just think about it. Why? Give me one good reason. I got a million of them. It gets my back. It can't take it anymore. But a young fellow like you should do real good. I hope so, Mr Falkenburg. It will take most of my savings to swing it. You won't make any mistake mister .. mister ..? Harper. - Harper, that's right. And I'll bet in a year from now you'll come to my office .. And thank me for selling you this place. Yeah, I hope so. Alright, I'll do it. Here's a hundred dollars as a deposit. And make out a bill of sale. Is that alright? Fine. I'll write you out a receipt. Mind if I use your desk? Not at all. Come on in, honey. We just bought it. Well honey, we've burned our bridges. I'm so glad for you, Frank. I'll quit my job and take over just as soon as the papers are made out. Ever since we married he's talked about owning a gas station. I finally said: stop talking and do something about it. Very wise of you, Mr Harper. Show me a successful businessman and I'll show you a smart wife every time. There is your receipt, Mr Harper. I'll have the papers ready in a few days. Thank you very much. This might be the beginning of your first million, Mr Harper. And I am the one that wishes you all the luck in the world. Thank you. Now that you are in business here. I think I ought to show you that house we were talking about. Right. Let's look at it. Hey, Waldo. Come here. I want you to meet Mr and Mrs Harper the new owners of the station. Sergeant Waldo Harris. - Pleased to meet you. All my friends call me Frank. - And I am Kay. I was just taking them up to show them the old Kincade place. You must like big houses. - I sure do. Folks, let's get started. Hello. Hattie? Get the trailer fixed. The suckers fell for it. What kind of news they got in these papers? Miss Martha Gregg and Mr George Albert Honeywell Thurston Junior .. Will say marriage vows in Sunday. That is the headlines. But you can't find out how the horses did at Del Mar today. We've only been here a month and I'm going nuts already. Let's step out some place. I said. A young married couple who've just gone in business for themselves .. Can't afford nightclubs. But we got three more months of this, Kay. It was your idea. A million bucks laying in a 2-bit safe you said. I never counted on a deal like this. "Integrate yourself in the town", Flood says. Be respectable. Make them forget there was a time you didn't live there. I'm beginning to think like a square. That will be ten and a half gallons Mrs Smith. Have you had your oil checked lately? All that money ready to drop in your hot little hands and you're complaining. Relax. Relax, she says. I'll relax when I've got one foot in the grave. Hey. I've got a great idea. I'm going to bed. Hiya, Dutch. It is a long time. Fifteen years. - Yep. You are a hard man to find. Yeah? I sent for you Dutch because I wanted the best. But you work Bunco. What could you need me for? The greatest. Something right straight down your alley. Hey, mister. Have you got a knife? My line is tangled. No, I'm sorry sonny. I haven't. You run along, eh. Wait a minute. Thank you very much, sir. - That's alright, sonny. Yeah. Dutch. They will write about this trick for twenty years. Yeah, but I won't be here. How much? To come in? Me. Ten percent. No, Flood. I'm an old man. Percentages are no good for me. If the job is as big as you say. Cash will be cheaper for you. I ask no questions. I go there. I blow the safe. I go home. In advance. You will pay me fifteen thousand. Fifteen thousand. Seven o'clock, Frank. You'll be late. I'm on my way, baby. Was that a deal last night? Hunting grunion. Whoever thought I would hunt grunion and with a banker yet. Nothing wrong with Sam Loxley. Oh darn it. They always stick to the griddle. I showed you before. All it takes is a little genius. Look at this mess. - That one is no good. You got to keep the griddle greased. So they don't stick. That is the whole secret. Then. Put the batter on like this. Then you wait. It's a cinch. You make everything look so easy. Haven't you ever tried mixing a little cinnamon in the batter? That's the greatest. Flood likes them that way too. Flood? Everything is Flood. Do you ever think for yourself? I sure do. Sometimes I wonder how come he trusts us here together. You are not exactly poison you know. Well. That's the first nice thing you've ever said to me. I'd begun to think I was a stick of furniture or something. Don't get me wrong, baby. I don't play that way, kid. You are Flood's girl and I'm his partner. Until I met Flood I was a nothing. You think he is a real big man, don't you. That one is done. You know. This trick will go down in the history books. A handful of guys and one dame take over a whole town. Heist a million in cash with no pain or strain. We got to give that Flood credit. He can set up a job like nobody in this world. Yeah. I'm going to play it smart this time. I'm going to give Flood a big hunk of my dough to invest for me. That's nice. I'll bet you will be glad to kiss this off, huh? No more housekeeping or putting on an act like we were married. You and Flood can do whatever you want to do. I am through with Flood. - What are you talking about? It's been over for a long time. I guess we didn't know it but that's how it is. Flood is not going to like that. Nobody brushes Flood off. Four months and I can hardly remember what he looks like. I think it is because I don't want to remember. He is your headache, baby. I just hope I'm not around when you tell him. Good morning. Thanks for coming at this early hour. It is too important to talk at your office. I figured as much. You got another cup there Eddie, please. Thanks, Eddie. - That will be all. Councillor. There are ten one-thousand dollar bills in this envelope. Five of them belong to you. Should I ask for what? And as your attorney should I ask about the five bills that aren't mine? If you don't know by next Sunday or Monday .. You keep your five and return the other five to me at your convenience. If on the other hand the other five have to be used for .. Some important purpose I feel sure you will read about it in the newspapers. But if anything come up that should necessitate using the other five? You'd better alert Simon. He is sometimes difficult to locate over the weekends. If I'm going to need bail I want him on the job. How about the others involved? Councillor, I can't protect everybody now, can I. Of course. How about some coffee? - Please. Hello. - Hi. Frank around? Sure is. We're playing scrabble with the Loxleys. Come in. You mind leaving the door open so I can hear the squawk box? Not at all. Come on in. Hello Waldo. They are taking us again. Kay knows all of Mr Webster's private words. Now wait a minute. Alice, look that last one up in the dictionary. Dax. D-A-X. Ever hear of it, Waldo? - I'm just a policeman. A tool for trimming roofing slates. Maybe she used to be roofer. Like to go fishing tomorrow, Frank? - Have some lubes the first thing. That proves it. A man gets successful and he has no time to relax. We were talking about you at the bank this morning, Frank. Find another location and I think we can arrange a loan. Can you imagine? A banker wanting to lend me money. I guess I had better shove. Maybe Monday? - See you. Well, we had better be going too. It's time the kids were in bed. Not until you've tasted my fruit cake. Oh. I'm sorry. I am on a diet. She goes on a diet twice a month. I looked at the scales this morning and I'm going to lose 15 pounds or bust. Honey, I got news for you. You are going to bust. Hey Bennie. Wake up. Hiya, uncle Frank. Hi Bennie. How you doing? I'm sleepy. Well, you've had a big night. Come on, get up boy. You like kids so much. What are you waiting for? Sam. Have them while you're young I always say. You'll enjoy them more. That's what I keep telling him, Sam. But he wants to have the gas station free and clear. Look, if we all waited for the things we wanted no-one would probably have kids. If I could guarantee they'll turn out like Bennie, I'll try. By the way, Frank. How did you do last week? Cleared a $145 after expenses. Old Falkenburg never did that well all the time he had the station. It has been wonderful, Kay. And don't forget the barbecue on Saturday night. We'll be there. - Good. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Big deal. 145 bucks. I thought you meant it. I thought you were proud of it. You think I'll spend the rest of my life running a lousy gas station? Yes. There's nothing I'd like better. - Are you out of your mind? No. I am seeing things straight for the first time. Ever since we came here and met people like the Loxleys. I like the Loxleys. They are alright for squares and the kids are cute. If we pull this job we're set for life. What Sam says about having another gas station makes sense to me. A million dollars and you want to blow it. Remember when I went back east before I came here? You said you wanted to see your family. I haven't seen my sister in five years. I never met her husband or kids. They live in a lousy little flat and keep the baby crib in the front room. There it belongs. She's got a husband and kids. No diamond rings or mink coats. But a family. I'm so jealous of her I could scream. I'm sick of the way I've been living. It's too late to pull out now. Zimmer will be here tomorrow. Then the rest of them. If you walk out now folks would think you walked out on me. And that will draw attention to us. Wait a minute Frank, please. Baby. Why don't you wait until it is all over? You get your cut. And you can brush Flood off or do whatever you want to do. If I don't quit now I'll never shake loose. Sure you will, baby. No dice. I Don't mix pleasure with business. [ Doorbell ] I'm coming. Yes? Flood's girl? Uhuh. I am Zimmer. Phew, what a trip. Have you got a drink? In the dining room. Gin? Help yourself. Hello, Frank? Your uncle is here. Psst. Hold it there, Frank. Yes? I want the 2-dollar tour first thing. Flood's orders. He wants to say hello to you. Okay. He'll be right over. That's the majestic. Movies from 6:30 until midnight. A kid's matinee on Saturday. How long you been here? Four months. How do you take it? Anything else you want to see? - Whatever there is. I got to work with whatever there is. The work is no good. You blow your bang-juice and what do you get? A lot of noise and no action. Is that all the fire department you got? Except for the marine base. If it's something big they send equipment from Camp Pendleton. If it gets out of hand I guess they come up from San Diego too. Now that I like. Good solid construction. If you blow that up they'll have a job on their hands. What is that? - City Hall. Say, that might be alright too. Drive around it. Yeah. Yeah, I kinda like her. She would make a nice one. Very nice. Okay. Let's stop somewhere. My throat is dry. You have plenty to drink at the house. We'll beat it back there. - Fine. Is everything alright? - Yeah. I'll show you to your room. Supper will be ready at six. - Okay. I've got a better idea. Flood sure does things right. - Yep. Give me that bottle. - Oh no. If you get loaded you won't be any use to anybody. Now give me the bottle. - Why? Give me the bottle. Flood said you would look after me. You sick close to this room until we are ready to go. If any of my friends should drop in I shall tell them my uncle is here. But he is not feeling well. If you run into anyone your name is Bill Jameson. You come from Bakersfield. You are a retired salesman. Alright? Okay. - Got everything? A good blast man carries his own stuff. And Flood picks nothing but the best. Like Dutch Paulmeyer. You know him? No. It's a privilege to work with an artist like Dutch. You wouldn't give me a short one, would you? No. You are hard mister, like Flood. Oh yeah. He gave me this letter for you. Alright. Please, Mr Harper. Just a little one, please. No dice. I can't take it, Frank. That Zimmer gives me the creeps. Yeah. He's the kind that starts fires for kicks. A letter from Flood. He wants to meet you, tomorrow. If you are thinking what I think you are thinking, don't do it. I've got to tell him. Don't tell him anything. When Flood is working on a caper he doesn't think of anything else. As long as you don't open up a can of beans you'll be alright. But Frank, I've got to tell him. Anybody home? They are sure running today. I stopped by the station but you weren't there. My uncle blew in and I gave him a grand tour. Two bass and one perch. Should come in handy for the company, huh? Why, thanks. I'm sure you will enjoy it. Uncle Bill. I want you to meet a friend of mine. This is my uncle. Bill Jameson from Bakersfield. Shake hands with Sergeant Waldo Harris. Bakersfield, huh? I've got a sister lives there. She runs a beauty parlor. I don't know her. I don't use beauty parlors. That's a good one. "I don't use beauty parlors." Well, Franky-boy. My stomach is bothering me. Maybe you got something? There is some soda mints in the medicine cabinet. Like the book says. A little gin for my stomach's sake. Well, I think I will lie down now. Most pleased to have met you, Sergeant. Who is that? - It's Kay. Is Mr Flood here? He called a few minutes ago. He said for you to wait. Can I make you a drink? A scotch please. With lots of water. Sit down. I don't touch this stuff myself. That's nice. Or smoke. I take care of myself. If you don't take care of your health and your body you are nobody. Well, you are like everybody else. I'm Roy. Did he say how long he would be? [ Doorbell ] [ Doorbell ] Hello. Oh, you're Flood's girl? Yeah. And this is Harry's girl only he just found her. Mr Flood isn't going to like her being here. Ah, shut up will you. - He said nothing about girls. There is no reason I can't have Doll with me. She worked for the library. Listen, you jokers. I'm going for a swim. If you want to come along Harry, okay. If you want to stay here and rap with that crumb, okay. Who you calling a crumb? Hey. You keep your hands where they belong. Do you understand? Keep them where they belong. When Mr Flood comes back I'm going to tell him about Doll. He didn't say nothing about girls and Harry brought one. You'd be angry too if you was Mr Flood. Now wouldn't you? I guess so. Hey. Hey .. feel that. Feel it! It's like a rock, isn't it. Mr Flood trusts me. He understands me and he trusts me. He is .. he is pretty late. Harry can't do that. I guess he can't. It always gets the girls. [ Doorbell ] That must be Mr Flood. Hiya, Mr Flood. - Hello, Roy. Where is Harry? Mr Flood, we have to talk about him. - Oh? You got something on your mind, Roy? Yes sir, Mr Flood. I want you to know that I told them not to go out. You did? - Yes, sir. Both of them. - Both of who? Harry and Doll. You see Mr Flood he's got this girl with him. Why didn't you tell me about this, Roy? Well Mr Flood you told me not to call you no matter what, sir. That's right. That's right, Roy. So I did. How much does Doll know? Well, that we are here to do a job. That's not nice. Isn't that just ducky. I told them sir that you wouldn't go for it. You told them right, Roy. That's real smart of you. You. Keep my girl happy while she waited for me? Yes, sir. I gave her a drink. We had a nice long talk. You showed her your muscles too, didn't you? Yes, sir. I warned you about that, Roy. I guess I forgot, Mr Flood. You ought to remember those things better, Roy. You ought to remember how I happened to meet you. You were in trouble, remember? A real jam. I got you out of it. Remember what I told you would happen the next time? Yes, sir. Is everything okay down there? Yes. Frank's got everything all lined up. Ah, great. Are you happy? - Why not? Frank .. is he happy? Why don't you ask him? It isn't every young fellow that finds himself a .. Ready-made wife. I don't know what you are talking about. Frank is my boy. I want him to be happy. Stand up and let me get a good look at you. Come and kiss me, honey. For four months you haven't kissed me. - Flood, I .. Something has changed, kid. It wasn't like this before. Oh, yes it was. What's changed, Kay? Us. It is all over. It's been over for a long time. Hasn't it? Yet you want to talk? That's it. Frank? If it was I'd tell you. He had nothing to do with it. Frank is your partner. He is loyal. I was just something around the house. A stick of furniture. And you didn't like that. It isn't Frank. It isn't anybody. I'd hate to think it was Frank. I'm getting out when the job is done. I'm going home. Oh? Let me buy you a drink for old time's sake. [ Doorbell ] Hello, Mr Flood. - Hello, Harry. So that's Flood? You are cute. Real cute. Why they all say .. - Stop. Mr Flood, give me a chance to explain, will you. You had better explain, Harry. Roy. Roy! Yes, Mr Flood? Keep your eye on the little tramp. Don't let her out of here. Harry. Alright. Alright. I hear you. Hello? Oh, Frank. Frank, I .. No, no. She didn't come back yet. But frank, I . Yeah, I'll tell her. I'll tell her. How about some gin, Frank? You stay there. I'll pick up a bottle on the way home. You got that? Oh, sure. It shows you are a real pal. [ Police siren ] It sounds like a big one. Yeah. It looks like it might be the old furniture warehouse. Yeah. If I'm not back in time lock up for me, will you. Zimmer. Zimmer. Zimmer. Give me a hand, Frank. Glad you're home. Does your uncle get loaded like this often? Just since his wife died a few months ago. You'd better watch him, boy. I found him in town leaning against a building. You shouldn't let him out alone. Believe me, never again. He is liable to get in trouble. - I'll get him some water. He sure smells like a distillery. It was beautiful . What did you say? It was .. Beautiful. This has been some afternoon. First the fire. Here's your water uncle Bill. First the fire, then this. I was trying to control traffic downtown when I spotted him. He looks a little better now. Okay pal, I'll roll. Better keep an eye on him. Thanks for bringing him home. Hiya Frankie-boy. You stupid slobbering maniac. I told you to stay in your room. Get up there and stay there or so help me I'll kill you. Is everything alright? The garage door was open. Flood and the rest are behind me. Flood? - I'll tell you later. Open the doors. Flood shouldn't be here until tomorrow. - There has been a switch. Here they come. Hi, Frank. Let's go. Keep it quiet. No talking. Kay, show them to their rooms. Doll here can room with you. Hey, wait a minute. - Come on, will you. Shut up. Who is the dame? Some cheap floozy Harry picked up in a bar. How much does she know? Enough to wreck everything. That's why I'm pulling a switch. We'll do the job tomorrow, not Sunday. On Saturday night the bank is lit up like a Christmas tree. Don't worry about it. How is everything here? Zimmer got loaded. Started a fire. They picked him up. Lucky for me the copper is a friend of mine and passed it off. Great. I sure am grateful for you and Kay. You two I don't have to worry about. - That's for sure. If that Doll keeps on squawking so help me I will .. No-one coops me up in this lousy room. - Doll, will you be reasonable. Reasonable? I'm reasonable. What are you talking about? I'm going downstairs. I warn you Harry, I'm not going to stay here and you can't .. Look, will you shut up! Who is going to make me? - Doll, will you be reasonable? Keep your hands off me, you big ape. Harry, keep your hands off me! Now you see why I don't like this kind of a caper. Oh, we are due at a barbecue tomorrow night. Barbecue? About six o'clock. It would look funny if we cancel. What time will you be back? - Around nine. No later. We're due to roll at nine-thirty. What a set up. Mr and Mrs Harper. If I didn't know you so well you'd even have me fooled. I'll got into the service station tomorrow same as always. Kay tells me you are starting to make a profit out of that grease-pit. Another four months and I bet you might have gone straight, huh. That garage door is still unlocked. Come on. Make some coffee and sandwiches will you, Kay. I remember when she couldn't even boil water. Ah, cut it out. Where is Flood? I want to see him. As soon as he comes in. I'm going to tell him how you and Frank pushed me around. You just do that if it makes you feel better. I picked this car in Tijuana and switched licence plates with a customer. You did? I'd better muddy them up, huh? Harry drove this low-line in from Chicago. Boy, it can really move. Picked up some plates in Santa Barbara. I guess Kay told you, huh? What? We're all washed up. Oh? Yep. Yep. It's all over. Here are the guns. I hope we don't need them. Well, you never can tell. I guess you can't send two people to play house together for 4 months and .. Not expect something to happen. You are singing a bum tune, Flood. I never double-cross anybody. Sometimes these things happen. Maybe you don't want them to happen but .. They do. Nothing happened! I'm glad to hear you say that, Frank. We've been working together a long time. I'd hate to split with you on account of a dame. If we bust up it will be because we don't need each other anymore. Okay, pal. No hard feelings? No hard feelings. - Good. Better get these in the house, huh. Zimmer. Hey, Zimmer. How you doing? It's good to see you again. Same here, Mr Flood. Believe me. I'm sure glad you got here, Mr Flood. That Frank. He won't give me a drink. You know I got to have my gin. You promised me. You mean Frank hasn't looked after you? He treats me like I was dirt. Well, you just leave Frank to me. Zimmer. How about that fire today? Oh, it was a real nice one. Real nice. Yeah. But you promised me, Zimmer. No fires. Well, I .. Sometimes I can't help myself. But I brought with me a go-devil, Mr Flood. A new delayed action exploder. You wind it up. Set it for when you want. And then at the right time. There is a big, beautiful explosion. I like you, Mr Flood. You make me feel like I am somebody. You don't laugh at me or push me around like Frank does. That dame too. Maybe she is your girl, Mr Flood, but .. I'd keep my eye on her if I was you. Really? I think she is soft on Frank. Zimmer, what makes you say a thing like that? Sometimes you know something because you feel it. I have watched them. Yeah. I know what you mean, Zimmer. Hey, why don't you .. Wash up and come on down and have a bite to eat. And we'll go over the action. Zimmer. If I were you I wouldn't let on how I felt about Frank and Kay. Everything okay, Mr Flood? You and Harry come on down in a few minutes. We've some things to run over. Yes, sir. Hey, you. Flood. Look, honey. If I were you I'd get back in the room, huh. Not until we've had a little talk. Will you get back in the room and stay there. With what I know mister, no-one is pushing me around. Oh? What's on your mind? I'm like the pitcher only I've got two hits. I want a cut. A cut? C-U-T. Perhaps we could walk out of here with maybe a million bucks. For 25 grand I'd get amnesia. Okay. It's a deal? - Sure, why not? You are cute. Would you do me just one little favor? - I told you, you were cute. Just go in your room and keep quiet. Honey. I'm deaf and dumb. A couple more drinks and I'll be blind. Why did you tell him anything? I tell you he took it fine. - That's what worries me. If Flood blows his top you know where you stand. When he dummies up and he uses that phoney smile, he is up to something. I know him as well as you do. Maybe better. - Yeah? What do you think happened in the garage? He got me out there to find out how things stand. Between you and me. And how do they stand, Frank? I'd never thought I'd say this. I'm a light-footed guy. I never stay put. After the caper is over. If you will have me. I'll buy you that ever-loving ring. Kay, got those sandwiches ready? Any time you say, Flood. Let's get that hungry mob fed, huh. We have a lot of rehearsing to do. Let's run through the action once again. At 9:30 Zimmer and I take off and head straight for the paint factory. That's where I start with the bang-juice. By ten o'clock we should hear the first alarm. Right. That is my signal to take off for the power station. Roy and I wait exactly five minutes. Then we pick up Dutch Paulmeyer round the corner from the bus station. That puts us here at exactly 10:15 By that time the town will be on its ear. They won't know what is going on. Police cars tearing through. Fire engines screaming. The paint factory here on the far side of town will be in flames. Everybody will be flocking there. That will leave the business section of the town deserted. At 10:20 Roy and Dutch and I. Will be in the alley right behind the bank. By that time I will .. I'll have the high school blasted. You should hear the second alarm. They will be running around in circles. There won't be any trouble at the school, Frank? Saturday night it is empty. Okay. Now we have got two explosions going. Harry has the power station knocked out. The town was in blackness. No juice. No burglar alarms. Nothing to worry about. Then we hit the bank. And knock off the vault. Very, very sweet, Mr Flood. Now after I've blacked out the town. I high-tail it back here to cover the alley. Don't forget the special cop. He clocks in at the draper's shop at exactly 10:15. The again in exactly one hour. It will take Dutch more than half an hour to blow that vault. He's got his tools all set, Frank? - Checked and double checked. By 11:15 we'll be on our way with the green stuff. Right. You and Roy get Dutch to the bus station in time to catch the 11:30 out of town. And then you head south for San Diego, cut inland and go back up to L.A. I'll bring the bundle back here. And meet you in town tomorrow night at seven. For the pay-off. Any questions? Smooth as silk. How about a drink? Okay. Anybody else want any? Can I have a peanut butter sandwich and warm milk? Don't forget to sterilize the peanut butter. Kay, will you rustle up some more food for the boys. Be right with you. How about that drink? - Coming right up, buddy. Roy. Before you turn in I want to have a little talk with you. Yes, sir. You call that a drink? Look. Tomorrow night, after. You can get loaded. A bird couldn't wet its beak in this. - Sorry, pal. This is the way it has got to be. Expecting somebody? - No. Upstairs. Everybody but Frank and Kay. Keep it quiet. Roy, Kay. Somebody is coming. [ Doorbell ] Hiya, Sam. - Hello, Frank. What have you got there, Bennie? - A dog. I found him. Hi. Say, that's quite a dog. His name is Murphy. We are not keeping you folks from anything? No, Sam. I wondered if we can borrow your card table for the barbecue tomorrow. Sure, they are right here in the den. - Don't know what's got into Alice. But she's asked everyone she knows. It will have to go something to be as good as your last party. I can't come to the party. I got to rehearse for the summer festival. He has two shows this year. Well, we'll be there to hear you singing. You'd better be good. Hey, Murphy. Come back here, Murphy. Hey, Murphy. Come back here, Murphy. Come back! Comeback here, Murphy. Bennie, come back here. Stay there. I hope I didn't frighten you. But Frank's uncle is asleep up there and you might have wakened him. My uncle hasn't been feeling so good since he got here. I warned him when he retired to get a hobby but he didn't do it. He has nothing to do so he gets ulcers. - I hoped you could bring him along. Come on Bennie, let's go. We've caused these folks enough trouble. See you tomorrow night, Kay. - Goodbye, Sam. You feel better? That ocean got me that time. You are an awful good swimmer. I'm good at everything. What is eating you? As though I didn't know. Doll. Darn it's a shame that you are Harry's girl. I don't belong to nobody. - I could sure go for you. I'd better get out of these wet things and put my dress on. Well, today is the day. Yep. I'll tell Pepi uncle isn't feeling too good. I'll be back here at five. That will give us time to change and to get over to the Loxleys. Okay. You and I will stick around for another month. Just so everything looks kosher. I'd like to get out of here right now. We've been over that a hundred times. What do you say next week we take off to Tijuana? Get married. - Sure. Hey. You sound like I invited you to a funeral. I've got the most awful .. - Stop it! Everything is going to be alright. I'm going to be late. Tell Flood I'll be back around five. Have you seen Doll? No. Something screwy going on around here. Good morning. - Have you seen Doll? Doll? She is probably in San Francisco by now. What? She griped about hanging around here so I gave her some money and sent her home. That wasn't very smart, Flood. Is she starts to talk we're dead. I gave her enough to keep her going outside for a while. By the time she changes her mind me and Frank will be in Brazil. Kay. If you are smart you'll clear out of the country too. What about me? And Roy? You are both over 21. Which one do you want? Alright, you hold this. There you are. Time, Bitzi. Oh Shirley. You've got that all over your face. There you are. Thanks for helping out, Frank. You got here just in time. I'm on my third hamburger. That sauce is sure hot. - That's the only way to make it. That Dr McCormick did the operation. But he is expensive. I always say you get what you pay for. Hello, honey. Why don't you go and get another hamburger, huh. Go ahead. Can I get you anything? - No thanks. A nice party, huh. Like the ones we had when I was a kid. The neighbors would drop in and Pop's brother would play the concertina .. And Pop would dance Mom around until she was dizzy. I never remember many good times. Pop worked in a mine until it finally got him. Ma had to raise six kids. I never had the time or the money for fun. I remember one Christmas. Things were so tough. Let's not talk about that. This is a nice party. You want to dance? I'd love to. [ Radio: ] "We interrupt this program to bring you the following announcement." "The battered body of a young woman has been found in the surf at San Felipe." "She was about 22 years old, 5 feet 6, and 115 pounds." "Dark eyes, blond hair." "Anyone having information leading to the identification of this woman .." "Should immediately contact the San Felipe police department." "And now, back to our program." It's Doll. He didn't have to kill her. This is it, Frank. I'm through. I'm not even going back to the house. I have 12 dollars. I'll buy a bus ticket and I'll go as far as it will take me. You have to make up your mind. If you stay here I'm saying goodbye to you right now. What's it going to be, Frank? I ought to go back and beat his brains out. No, Frank. No, please Frank. Let's get out of here now. I've only got 26 bucks, baby. Then we are starting with 38. It could be worse. Get a load of the lovebirds. That kind of kiss can mean only one of two things. A new car or a baby. Well, we're not talking. These are my oldest and best friends, Joe and Dee Stancil. Glad to know you. - We drove up from San Diego. Joe, Dee. Where you been? I got to tell you about these two. Alice and I went on their honeymoon. On their honeymoon. I'd love to stay and listen Sam, but I promised my uncle I'd be home early. What are you talking about? It's not 9 o'clock yet. I tell you what. Wait until 10 o'clock and I'll drop you. I must leave to get Bennie at school. Bennie at the high school? Yeah. They are rehearsing there for the festival tonight. I thought the festival was held at the stadium. Sure, but there's no dates at the stadium until Sunday. So they use the high school. They always do. Stick around kid and I'll see you later. What do you want me to do? - Zimmer. Those kids. We've got to tell Flood. - That wouldn't stop him now. The only thing we can do is to put Zimmer out of action. Hello baby. We're up and running. Right on time. Start counting your money. All Frank has to do is get Zimmer to the paint factory and the school on time. What's the matter? - Not a thing. This is the end of the line. - It's going to ruin the caper. Flood will be .. - Relax. This is as far as you go. Okay. I could sure use a drink. I can't help you. How about a smoke? Flood warned me. He knows all about you and the girl. You said you might try and pull a fast one and if you did .. For me to take care of you. Get out. I'm losing time. Alright, boys. 9:54. You look worried, kid. Do I? Don't fence with me you little tramp. You thought I'd fall for it, didn't you: "Frank's your partner." "He's loyal. I'm nothing, just a stick of furniture around the house." [ Loud explosion! ] Zimmer. Right on time. Shake it up boys. We've got to roll. I sent you here as I trust you. But you are two-timing the first chance you get. Let's see what happens to Frank tonight. - Please. Go Harry. Think it over, kid. Maybe he'll come back. Maybe you won't. What happened to that second alarm? - Be patient, Mr Flood. Zimmer knows his job. Pop, come on. Let's go. There. Here. Stop it. Stop it! Come on .. try it. Hold it here, Roy. Zimmer is a little late with that explosion. Where is it? Where is it? In the furnace room. Opposite the stairs. How much longer, Dutch. - Don't rush me. Soup. - There. I make my own nitro-glycerine. Then I can depend on it. Close the bag. I am through with it. Now get back. Get way back. To you. Try it again. I will be in the car, Flood. Remember, my bus leaves at 11:30. Okay, Dutch. That canvas bag. Is Zimmer back? Where is Frank? Where is he? That's what I'd like to know. We'll know when Zimmer shows up. When did the lights come back on? A few minutes ago. You and frank were having a ball behind my back, weren't you. The second explosion at the school. It never came off. What do you know about it? - Well, you got your money, didn't you? I asked you a question! What happened? Answer me. The school was packed with kids. - On a Saturday night? We found out at the barbecue. Why didn't you tell me? We knew if it was the money or the kids you would take the money. No Zimmer. 0pen it and let him in. Don't tell him I'm here. Is that you, Frank? - Yeah. Open it. Is everything alright, honey? Look out! I always wanted to see what a million dollars looked like. Wow. Take the other car and get Waldo. I want to see the look on Flood's face when Waldo steps in here. Honey. No matter what happens to us after that. It will be worth it. -(t-g)-
