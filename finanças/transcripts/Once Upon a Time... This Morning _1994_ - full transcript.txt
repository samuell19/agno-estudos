Are you really moving tomorrow? Yes, early tomorrow. Don't forget to call and let us know your number. Sure. You're lucky, getting accepted at "Mater". Many others get accepted. But I'm not. My daddy said my new school was the football champ. They're here since kindergarten, what make you decide to have them transferred? We'd like them to be in the school closer to our home. Isn't here close enough? We're moving to a new home. Okay. Here, it's all done. Thank you, I have to say goodbye. Good luck. Thank you. Let's go, Onn. Ohh, bring your brother. I've got to go. I've got to go. Don't forget the number. Bye. Goodbye. Let's go. We'll stop by at the supermarket. I'll prepare a special meal. Let's celebrate a farewell to our old home, okay? Okay. Don't forget my favourite. Definitely, everybody's favorites. It's from Mom. Come on dad, let me. "Will be late tonight"...late again. "Remind Ohh to pack and take care of the baby" Go dad. Watch out. I'm going to get you now. Come on Umm. Let's go. Ohh, be careful! How's it Umm, having fun? It's no big deal. Nothing to be afraid of. Come here, give him to me. If it were you, and daddy pushed it as fast, how about it? How about what? Come, race with me. Okay. Be careful. Watch out for the car. Then, the prince and his horse are going to rescue the princess and the kids from the witch castle. But that wicked witch came back and flies right in front of the prince, princess, and children You are very good getting in my castle But no one ever lives to tell In a meantime, the witch said Hmm... What's it call That one-eyed giant. Yes, she called for the one-eyed giant from the pit. All of a sudden, the witch used her power to darken the sky, so dark that no one could see anything. The prince then swung his magic sword around, to bring back the sparkling stars to the sky. So they could see the trail. Mommy's home. Have you eaten yet? I did. Why's the house so dark? Daddy's telling us a fairy tale. Daddy, let's continue. It's really a fun. Aww... Onn Come on daddy. Did you pack your stuff yet? Not yet. Haven't I told you to? And still up so late. It's okay, I'll help her pack. Come on guys, let's get to bed. But it's not ended yet. Don't complain. You've listened to it so many times already. But it's still fun. Some other time, okay? Hey, who do you want to be, prince or princess? May be the horse? I want to be the prince. How about being a witch? Dad, how's our new home? It's an apartment. They don't have a yard like ours then. They should, every large apartment usually has one. They might even have a playground. What? You've never been there? No, I've never been there. Come on, flight. - Get it, that one-eyed giant. - Again. You too, better sleep now, so you can get up early. Strange, why haven't you been there? Sleep. Thanks. Give me a hand. Easy... Easy. Be careful, it belonged to my great grandfather. Higher, be careful. Oh, my god. I'm sorry. What? - Help! - What is it? Nid. - What? - A turtle! Help me! Oh, just a turtle. What a scream. Onn, come out here. Bring your Ninja out too. Didn't I tell you? I don't allow you to bring Ninja along. If he's here alone, who will take care of him? Who will feed him? Enough. It'll find its way to survive. Take it back to the pond. Now. - But he'll die. - Now! Are you throwing this away? We'll keep them. They're daddy's fairy tales. Go, get down to your pond. I don't want the children to have any problem. At least, during the first six months, you shouldn't make any contact. Give them a chance to learn about what's happening. After that, you may visit them sometime. But not too often. They're also my children. We've already agreed on this. Would you think it over? It's not only giving me a chance, but the children's too. It's over. It's already over. Pha. Get in the car. Ohh Ohh... We'll be leaving now Get in the car. What about dad? Why isn't he coming with us? He'll come. He has some work to finish. He'll join us later. What about his stuff? Why none of his thing is coming with us? They're all still in the room. Get in the car now, Ohh. I said he'll come. Onn, daddy's not going. Mommy lies, daddy won't live with us. Mom and dad won't live together anymore. That's enough! You lie, I'm not going, I'll stay with daddy. Ohh. Ohh, listen to me. Please. I don't want to go. I want to live here. Ohh. - Daddy please, don't get divorced. - Ohh. - Let's stay together please. - Wait, Onn. Please, I beg you. - Don't cry baby. Listen to me. - Ohh. This separation will just be temporary. Everybody should have some problems. And there is one between Mom and dad. But trust me, we shall work it out, and we'll be together again. I'll stay with you. Please, let me stay with you. No, you can't. I've got lots of work to do. I don't have time to take care of you all Go stay with your Mom, okay? I won't. Me too. Come on, do as I told, go with your Mom, and I'll come to see you. Come, Ohh, Onn. It's time to go now. Come on. If you don't go, Me and him are not going to talk to each other ever again. Go Come, Onn. Let's get going. When is daddy gonna come to see us? I don't know. Excuse me, Pha Ohh, Onn, come here, come see your room. This is your room, Onn. Do you like it? I also bought you this new desk. Okay, put your things in place. I'll be back to help. Come, Ohh. Your room, like it? Why don't Onn and I stay in the same room? You're not that young anymore, and should have a little privacy. Okay? I have to go help Onn unpack. It's very convenient here. The store downstairs opens 24 hrs. Your school is only 10 mins. Away by bus, and my office is just a little bit further. I can drive you to school everyday. What about Umm? I'll put him in the nursery downstairs. See? It's very convenient. Okay, let's eat. Here's yours, Umm. Come on, sweetie. Come on. Here, take it. It tastes really good. Doesn't taste good at all, daddy can do much better. Come on, Umm, take more. Come on, open your mount. Sleep, close your eyes now. How're you doing, Ninja? Here, eat this. I want to go home. Let's go back to our old home. Please Mom, you don't have to be good to daddy. You don't even have to talk to him. But let's live together again. Try to understand me, give me some time. It's too painful for a child at your age to feel. I can't stand living with him anymore. What's so painful? You're a woman like I am. When you grow up, you will understand. Go to sleep. Just don't think too much, give me a chance, give me some time. Oh dear... Oh my... Ninja. Ninja Help! Ohh! Onn! It's Ninja, hurry up! What's it, Mom? Ninja! It's right there. Take him away. Throw him out. Ohh, don't! Haven't I told you, not to bring him here. There're food in the refrigerator, warm it up yourself. I have an appointment, got to be hurry. Save sandwiches for lunch, or you may buy anything from the store downstairs, I've left some money in the drawer in my room. Oh, one other thing, it would be good if you will stop by sometime, to see your brother at the nursery downstairs. Let's go. Are you hungry? I'll warm something for you to eat. I'm not hungry, I'm not gonna eat. What we'll have for breakfast look delicious. I won't eat. Come on, try a little. Ninja. Ohh... I love you. What if Mr. Nirun wouldn't go for it? We've got to find someone else then. But if finally this doesn't work. Then, everyone for themselves. Really, having to meet with Mr. Nirun for just few times, I've already used nearly every bit of my endurance, and if it's not for a tiny chance of success I saw, I would have lost my patient by now. Wait for me Where do you think our house is? There, may be, over the horizon there. That's very far. I wonder what's daddy doing? He must be very lonely. Let's get back inside. Here's your brother. What a baby how annoying. Oh baby, don't cry. Whoa! Your mother called, she'll be late, she asked me to bring your brother up here. Now if he's still crying like this, we might not take him anymore. Quiet, please, don't cry. The prince burnt the witch's castle down, and all her magical power was destroyed, the witch became an old and helpless woman. The prince and the princess then got married, and lived happily ever after. That's the end. Why so soon? There're still some of witch's troops? Just forget about them, would you? Your story was not fun, daddy's was better. You're already drunk, better go home, please, it's very late. I'm just drunk of you. Don't be kidding, please go. I'm very tired, please. Okay, I'll go. But you should wait for me again tomorrow. I'll pick you up. But we already had two meals together today. Every meal everyday with you will be fine for me. Here you go again. Just drive carefully. And please don't forget, you had promised, you'd arrange for me a meeting with Mr. Chatree. I won't forget, be seeing you. Why don't you go? Gentleman's duty, Gotta see you in, Okay. Ohh! Hi kid. Good night. My god, what's going on? Why are you not in bed? Sis told us daddy's fairy tale. I told you to put your brothers to bed early? Is your daddy's tale more important than my order? Look at this, what a mess? I've been very tired through the day, and still I have to clean up all this mess. This should be finished, there'll be no more of this stupid fairy tale. If you throw it away, I will not live here. What did you say? I won't live here. Now I know, you hate daddy, you have a new boyfriend. What? You divorced because you want to have an affair. Stop it! I hate you... I hate you. Ohh. Ohh. Listen to me, I'm sorry. You don't understand, you were wrong about me. Ohh. Ohh. Onn. Ohh. There's nothing between me and Mr. Nirun. Umm, quiet. I try to be good to him, because I want him to help finance my magazine. Otherwise I wouldn't make it. Ohh, open the door. Ohh. Ohh. Ohh. Ohh, would you come out and talk to me? I've got to go to work. I'll have to finish up the magazine for the printing house. Ohh. Okay, if you don't want to talk now. Just take care of your brothers. We'll talk when I get back. I've already warm up some food for you. Onn, be good, take care of your sister. I'll cook chicken-musmun for our dinner. Mom said nothing's going on. Do you believe her? Oh, my goodness, good morning. Hello Umm, Hi. It's strange, he always cries once he's in here. Come on, dear. Kids are all like this, he'll be quiet soon. Come, come to me. Especially him, he's very cute, easy to take care of, always in good mood. Just don't worry. He's already begun to love us here. I must go, it's getting late. Yes. I'm sorry. Ohh, where're you going? I'll go to see dad, I'll live with him. Let me go with you. I'll get my stuff. Don't bring too much. Let's go home, Ninja. Hurry up, Onn. You're stealing Mom's money.

Going down the elevator with the backpack like this, wanna get caught or what? Then how can we get out of here? There, the fire escape. Come, Onn. What about Umm?

Just wait for me here, I'll go get Umm. Let's do it. Could you just sleep? Here, your brother is really what people can't stand, crying all the time. Doesn't he know how to sleep? So let me take him to my apartment. Your mother's gonna ask for a return then. Here. If you want to take care of him, it's got to be here. Oh my.

I don't have the authority to stop the whole train, Just to search for the children who want to go to Chiangmai to see their father. But they are runaway children. If they'd already connected your husband to pick them up at the Chiangmai station, it didn't seem to be any problem at all. Thank you. Umm, quiet... don't cry. He may be hungry.

Go for Lopburi then. Where have you been? I went for a walk. Ohh, he's from Chiangmai. If daddy doesn't pick us up, he'll take us to him. Be quiet, dad will pick us up, no matter what. Sleep... If you keep crying, I won't take you to see daddy. Better tell him father's tale, he likes it. That's right. Get me that box. You lay down here, okay? Here it is, see? Once upon a time, there are children living in a village. Those children run away from home, to play in the garden near a castle... The cat started crying, and the dog was crying too. The elephant was larger than other animals and he could talk, so he told the Prince about what had happened. The Prince was very pity on them, therefore he promised that he would take the children back to their family. Check it out. Did he get off? There he is. Let's go. - Hey, Noklae. - It's not him. What the hell is he? Did he say Lopburi? He might catch another train. What another one? Go find him. Stop complaining Yes Check all the cars.

We'll wait for Noklae, then we'll make out a plan to help your brother and sister. We? How can we? If Noklae said it can be done, then it shall be done, you've got to believe me. If he is not that good, the Boss wouldn't have trusted him that much. They call him "tough" He never cry. The Boss used to whip him to the skin, he didn't utter a word. If he decided to take on the Boss, and help your brother and sister, you can bet on it. May the Boss go to hell. May that fucker go to hell. May that fucker go to hell. Hey, is this too early to say a pray? What pray? A magic pray to kill the beast. Did you find them? - Only the sister. - Ohh... She was there for sure. Did she got pop yet? I don't know. Why didn't you help her? What did they take her for? You don't want to know. Hey SEAR, go get something to eat. Wow! Hey, money's my business. I'll go with you. - None of your business. Back off! - That's big bill, where did you get it? What a hand. You bastard... you're spitting at me. When are you going to help my brother an sister? You fucker... don't push, will you? We can confirm now, the boy's name is "Noklae". He's the leader of those homeless boys. Do you know where he is? Did you get him? We're still looking for him. The problem is... They never stay in one place. For Noklae, he usually hang around the Bangkok Station and Rongmuang. We've checked over the whole area, but they all seem to disappear. What about our children? What to do now? We'll find them somehow. Nid, do you remember a story we published about a teacher who started a school for homeless children? Yes, that one. Would you look for his number for me? There's something urgent I'll have to ask him. Okay, I'll wait. What? The appointment was set? How about asking Mr. Nirum to postpone for now? What? The big guy is going abroad? I've to postpone it anyway. Just get me that teacher's phone number now. Easy, hey, easy. Here, eat. You bastard, where's my change? Oh shit, I forgot. Nice try. Take it easy, man. What a hell? With just this food, is this all change left? Are you trying to cheat me? Let's get him! I didn't take a shit, damn it. Oh yeah? I'm gonna kick your ass. I didn't take a shit. Hey, it's here.

Stop! When are we going to help my brother and sister? Rambo, I want you to spy on what's going on in the building. We'll be waiting outside. If CHALAO put his sister ot work, just let me know right away. Taking her from a customer is much easier than from that bitch and her bodyguards. What about my brother? I don't even know where's your brother. Okay Sear. You don't have to come along just go and find out where the Boss keep the baby. After we got his sister out, we'll go for the baby. Come on. May the Boss go to hell. May the Boss go to hell. How about it? - Wait till my turn. - Let's do it again. I'm first this time. Hey, the teachers! Hey... Why don't you take your friend to class. It's been days already It's their business, they don't want to go Where're you going? They'll do us no harm. Don't let them go. Hey kids, hold it. If his name is Noklae. And looks the way you've told me. Just don't worry. I know him and I think I can find him. I've found her... they've taken her to the customer just now. Are you sure it's her?

Don't forget what you did to me. You all gonna get it. Hurry up. They're after us. Hey! You idiot. So what, Boss? You two hit the street. Find out where they hide and take them in. No new at all? What about that boy? Thank you. Something like this shouldn't happen to us, the other day they still... It will not happen again. How can you be so sure? Before they're grown up. They do not want just only one of us, but they need us both. No way, it's already finished for us. Even for our children? Never bring up the children. For them? What did you do for them? Having fun with them? Always told them stories and had them spoiled? They're just living with nonsense and fantasy, don't you know that? How come they mode such a decision? I'm tired. I'm the on who'd been doing nearly everything, so don't ever make the children a reason for me to take it anymore, even when you're fooling around with someone else. - But that's not true. - It's true. It is not true. Okay, there're some talking, but nothing else. Liar! Okay, suppose it's true, but for the children, wouldn't you let it pass and forgive me? Why didn't you think about the children then? It's already passed, It's not even true, I'm talking about what's going on... Now! We still can't even find our children. But once we found them can't you just forgive me. And return the good things to their life? "I love you dad" Hey, eat. What do you bought? Roast duck. Here. I don't like duck. Just eat, man. This is already something, don't you know that? Eat some. How long have you guys been together? Sometime... Do you have a home? Why do you ask? Yeah, why? I'm eating, why the hell? Crazy again? Don't talk about home when he's around. His parents abandoned him ever since he was just a little baby. Noklae found him in a box somewhere. He never has a home. You have home? Ever think about going back home? For what? This is what we guess. Maybe he was thrown away by his parents too. What about you? Of course, I do. Ever think about going back home? For what? I never even know my father. I don't know how many men, my mother has. We are all like this. Otherwise we wouldn't want to be here. Noklae! Noklae. Hey, I've found where they hid the baby. Where? Oh, I'm hungry. You bastard, can't you just wait for a Moment? Where the hell did they keep him? At the Boss's shop. I've found out from one of Mr. Jua's boy. They planned to have the baby delivered tonight. The Boss is really mad at us. His men are looking for us everywhere. They want to take you in. But nobody says anything, just don't worry. Once Mr. Jua got the baby. It would be much more difficult to get him back. We've got to get him out before the Boss deliver him. Be careful. Don't wake him up. Easy. Kidnappers! Stop them! Get out and stop them! Ohh. Hurry up! They'll get us. Quick! Follow them. Close the back door, idiot! If they follow us, you lure them to the other way, okay? Let's go! Hurry! Here they come. Go now. I'll make sure they follow me. Come on. Hey, quick! - Come and get me, you damn Boss. - Come on, we're here. Not this way, stupid! Follow the others that way! Hurry! Run! Don't stop! Come on, Onn. Come on, Ohh. You're dead, Boss. He's got the gun, watch out! Ohh, watch out! AOM... Cross there! Hey! Umm. Umm. Umm. Umm. Umm. Umm. Umm. Umm. Umm. Careful... Umm. Almost have a heart-attack Is he alright? Is he hurt? He's so smart, he didn't cry at all. I'll kill you all. I'll kill you, Noklae. Get me my gun. Where's the gun? I don't know. You don't know? Does that really hurt you? I'll kill you. Come on. May the Boss go to hell. May the Boss go to hell. When are you gonna let me shoot your gun? Sleep here I'll take you home tomorrow. Can I shoot too? Oh yeah? The gun is almost as big as you are. Be still. I'll make you a pad to sleep on. I only have few bullets. We should save them for only when necessary. Once I get more. You guys can shoot as much as you want. Hey, I got two. Damn it, you're too young to talk dirty. Go, go to sleep. It's almost down. Okay, I'll tell you the story. Where's all the children? I'll cut up some more. See? Here's the children. I'm going to start the story now. Listen. Make it good, Ohh. Once upon a time. There were children who lived in a village. One day, they went to play in a garden near a castle without knowing that it belonged to a witch. The witch captured all the children, and used her spell to change them into animals. The parents tried to search for their children, but find no trace of them. They were all very sad and started to cry. A prince and a princess passed by. They felt very much pity on the children, so the prince used his magic sward to release them from the witch's spell. Suddenly, the witch appeared in the sky. She landed in front of the couple and the children. "You are very brave to come here," "but you won't get out of here alive." Instantly, she called out for her one-eyed monster, from a pit. And used her magic sword to darken the sky. The prince swung his magic sword around, to recreate the bright stars, till everyone was able to see again. Then the prince and the one-eyed monster started to fight. With his magic sword, the prince struck the one-eyed monster, till it fell to the ground and died. Then the prince burnt the witch's castle down. Which also destroyed all her magical power. The witch became a homeless and helpless old woman. The prince and the princess then started their journey to take all the children back to their home. And they all live happily ever after. How about going to Pattaya, having some fun before coming back to see your parents? I don't want to go anywhere. I just want to know if my parents have come back to stay together again so I can go home. It's just a couple of days, then we come back. Pattaya is gonna be a big fun. I know some people there. It's much better than here. Noklae, hey! The Boss already knows we're here. How're we gonna do? Who told him. I don't know. I heard it from the street. We'd better move now. Let's go pick up your stuff. Hey, move. Why. The Boss knows we're here. - Quick! Hold them all. - The one-eyed monster! - Onn, run! - Ohh. Let's go, come on. Stop them! Hurry up, jump. Let them go. Get the girl and the baby. - Where you think you are going? - Let go of me! - Come here! - Let me go! - Let me go! - Quick! Take the baby. Let me go! Where're you going? Here! I'll find you a new job. You've heard of "factory of hell", haven't you? And for you. CHALAO is waiting for you. Hello. Teacher? Are they found? Where? A whore house. Yes, I'm on my way now. Ohh... We can't help what's already happened. But we've got to get our children back. Call the police. I'll go with the teacher. Our children are in CHALAO's whore house, at Rongmuang. Come on. Passing out?
