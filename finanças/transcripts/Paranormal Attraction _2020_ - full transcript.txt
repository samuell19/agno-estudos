(FILM REEL WHIRRING) (EERIE MUSIC) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Oh god! Shh, shh, shh. (CHATTERING) MAN: There's nothing wrong with me! (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (DOOR OPENING) Drop the knife! Why won't she love me? FEMALE OFFICE: Drop it! (GUN FIRING) (DISTURBING MUSIC) (ETHEREAL MUSIC) (BIRDS WHISTLING) We're hoping to have it ready by August. When it's available, you'll be the first to know. All righty. Thank you. Buh-bye. Sara! Hi, Melanie! How are you? You're looking good. How's Jeff? Oh, I am so sorry. It slipped my mind completely. No, it's okay. You know, I never liked him anyway. You could do so much better. So, this is the house. (EERIE MUSIC) Ready to see what you'll be working with? So, what happened to the previous residents? They just, I don't know, disappeared. No note, no explanation, nothing. Just poof. The dog too. (CHUCKLES) Kinda spooky, huh? I'd say this is an easy job, but judging by all this shit, you're probably gonna be here a while. To think it was just a year ago I was handing them the keys. They were only here for a year? Mm-hm. They bought the house from me after the last owner died unexpectedly. Have I mentioned that the pool is heated? Treat the property as you would your own. Make yourself at home. Just remember everything needs to be packed, boxed up and dumped by the end of August. Oh, and watch out for vagrants. Vagrants? Oh, god damn it! It's an abandoned house with a heated pool. You do the math. (SOFT MUSIC) (CAN CLACKING) Master bedroom. Again, thank you so much for this opportunity. I won't let you down. Of course, dear. I know you'll do a great job. You know, when I heard what happened, I was shocked! Absolutely shocked! But after this, you'll have more than enough to get back on your feet, maybe bring in some new clients, hire some staff, get a new apartment. First things first. Have this house ready by the end of August, and I'll make sure you're take care of. The commission alone will more than make up for what I'm paying you. You can count on me. Excellent! And as long as you stay on schedule, I'm more than willing to look the other way if you, I don't know, bring a boy home or something, Melanie! What? I know what it's like being at your age. Newly single, all alone. Don't worry. A girl with your complexion, you'll do just fine. Well, I'd love to stay and chitchat, but these houses don't sell themselves. (KISSING NOISES) Your first payment's on the table. Say hi to your mother for me. (CAR STARTS) (CAR ZOOMING) (ETHEREAL MUSIC) (EXHALES SHARPLY) (SUITCASE UNZIPPING) (EERIE MUSIC) (DOOR CREAKING) Hi, this is Sara Myer, founder and CEO of Myer's Movers, documenting our services for an estate clean out. In this video, we'll be working at 27 Baker Street. We're making our way to the living room, which we will establish as our base of operations. Once we finish clearing it out, we will move on to the rest of the house. And here is the kitchen. As you guys can see, it is very messy. Financial documents will be saved just in case, and every item of value will be boxed and donated. If it's too big to be boxed, we will mark it for later pickup. All items not of any value will be thrown away. And even though we're not landscapers, we're gonna do some much needed maintenance in the backyard. (CLATTERING) (EERIE MUSIC) (CLATTERING) Boo! (STARTLING MUSIC) SARA: Jesus Christ! (laughing) Did I ruin the shot? What are you doing here? I just wanted to check in on my bestie, see how she's doing on her new gig. Aw! Well the house is pretty sweet. Wanna come check it out? Mm-hm. My horoscope specifically said that I'd be rewarded for helping someone in need today, so here I am. It's a lot of work. No shit. All right, but I can't pay you. I'm barely making enough as it is. The only payment I'll accept is the privilege of seeing my bestie. (KNOCKING) Kelly? Oh, what's up girl? How you doing babe? You brought Nick with you? Who do you think's gonna be doing the heavy lifting? What? Thought you were all about female empowerment. Nothing is more empowering than watching my sweat-drenched hunk lift heavy things. Sup, Sara? Hi Nick. How you doing, girl? Oh, great. How are you? You ready to do this? All right. Let's get to work guys. Alrighty!

Hey Kelly, did you touch my stuff? Kelly? (CAR HORN HONKING) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) Wow, there are a lotta hotties out here. You're in luck. I told you, I don't need a man. Just saying. Six months without dick in my life, I'd go batshit. Are you trying to say you're not crazy? Oh, ha, ha. Hey, you don't think he'll find me out here, do you? No! Of course not He has no way of knowing you're here. Hell, I could barely find your house with GPS. I could read your tarot cards if it'll make you feel better. No, it's okay. Plus, I'm pretty sure that's not how it works. That's exactly what a skeptic would say. (CHUCKLES) Come on, let's go. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (CAR STARTS) Kelly was right. (RUSTLING) Hello? (EERIE WHISPERING) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (EERIE WHISPERING) (SPRINKLER HISSING) (SPLASHING) Hello? You're not supposed to be here. Get lost or I'll call the cops. (SPLASHING) Seriously? I said get lost! (EERIE MUSIC) What the hell? (EERIE MUSIC) All seems normal here. Have you had these problems before? No. I mean, it's not my house. I'm just packing things up. Oh, I see. (WRITING) I was told it has a history of vagrants. I guess they like to swim. (WRITING) So, how long have you been with the police here? Three months. Yup. Fresh out of the academy. I could be dealing with a swan-diving serial killer, and they send a rookie to save the day? A swan-diving serial killer? It could happen. (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap at you like that, Officer... Bennett, Evelyn Bennett. And there's no need to apologize, Miss... Meyers, Sara. Sara. If you have any more scares like this, feel free to call me. That's my direct line. Absolutely. I will. I mean... I'll keep that in mind. (JANGLING) Bennett. Let's go. I'll let myself out. Have a good day. You as well.

(WHOOSHING) (SARA BREATHING HEAVILY) (EERIE MUSIC) (LAMP CLICKS) (UNSETTLING MUSIC) (SCRATCHING) (STARTLING MUSIC) (SARA SCREAMS) (INTENSE MUSIC) (BIRDS WHISTLING) You swear you didn't stop by? I was at the shop all day. Maybe it was one of those homeless. Maybe they're outside watching you right now. SARA: Shut up! Don't say stuff like that. Tell me more about this cop. Was he cute? I was a little too busy getting the shit scared out of me to pay attention to her looks. Ooh, a lady cop! How progressive! Was she cute? Yeah, kind of. And she left you her card? Sounds like she's into you. SARA: I'm pretty sure it's just a formality. You never know her. After all that shit you've been through with Jack, maybe a big strong police officer is exactly what you need. Can we talk about something else? Got something in mind? SARA: Ugh, you're gonna think I'm crazy. I would never! I had a weird dream last night. I was in the hallway, and there was this man in the doorway. More like a shadow. It scared the shit out of me, but also... Go on. It gave me the weirdest feeling. Good feeling or bad? You know that feeling when you lean against the washing machine during the spin cycle? (CHUCKLES) Isn't it obvious? What? I know you haven't been getting any since... him. Really think it's a coincidence you're having a wet dream after meeting this hot cop? I never said she was hot! Hon, at this point she could be Quasimodo and I'd still tell you to hit that. Your body needs a release. So what should I do? (SIGHS) Sara Myers, do I really need to spell it out for you? If you need any help, I might have something that can cure your condition. I am not sticking a crystal in me! I have other cures! Is that Sara? I didn't tell you to stop! Nick? Hey Sara! How's the cleaning going? Are you seriously on the phone with me while he's going down on you? I have needs, okay? At least I know how to channel my excess energy. Don't you roll your eyes at me! You know I'm right. Give that cop of call and ask her if she can show you her vagi. Ew! (GIGGLING) (MOANING) What are you doing? He just started doing something new. I gotta go. Ugh, you are unbelievable. And you love me for it. Bye! (LOUD BANGING) (EERIE MUSIC) I swear. (DOOR BANGING) Jeff, is that's you, I swear I'll call the cops! (BLINDS RUSTLING) (STARTLING MUSIC) (SARA SCREAMS) See you at the station. (CAR STARTS) Ma'am, it's all clear. Nobody's there? I was hoping you could help me fill in some of the blanks. (SIGHS) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) And then I heard a loud noise, so I came in here and... Everything was in disarray? Not at first. The drawers just opened by themselves. Was this open? Um, I don't know. Maybe. It could have been. Why? I'm thinking someone or something came in and they got spooked when they saw you. Do you know anyone that could have done this? I guess my... No, it's impossible. I'm thinking someone came in, they saw that this was open, tried to steal your clothes, and they got scared when you came back in. I guess, but... Are you all right? Sorry. I just got dizzy all of a sudden. Have you eaten yet today? Um, no, not yet. I've been too busy trying to get everything in order. Well, you can't work on an empty stomach, at least not for long anyway. Lucky for you, I happen to know this fantastic little diner in town. Has the best grilled cheese. I know it's not very healthy. No, I like grilled cheese. You're gonna love this then. I'll drive. We can cut through the red lights. After you. Look! There's her car! So what are we doing here again? I just wanted to check in on Sara. I got a weird feeling, and I needed to be sure. All right. You and you're weird feelings. Hey! They've yet to steer me wrong. Come on! All right. SARA: So, this is what it's like. EVELYN: What was that? Oh, I was just imagining what it's like to be arrested. If I were detaining you, I'd have to put you in handcuffs. I don't think you'd like that very much. Yeah, no thanks. They're cold, and they pinch like a mofo. I thought you'd never been arrested. (SARA CHUCKLES) SARA: More like crazy ex. Oh, sorry. Thank God for restraining orders. So, about that grilled cheese. Make sure you ask for bacon. They cut up a few slices, sprinkle it in the cheese. Your taste buds will be in heaven. Totally worth it. Sounds like my kind of heaven. You're gonna love it. (GATE SCRAPING) Babe, what are we doing here again? I just need to be sure Ha. Damn. Okay. Could come back later. Ah! Just one quick look around, and we'll go. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) What do you think happened here? Just check the garage. She might have heard us come in. Hey, Sara! You home? Just go. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) Being a whore! (WOMAN SCREAMING) Why won't you love me? (WOMAN SCREAMING) Babe, I don't- Whoa, are you okay? I think I- We need to get out. We need to leave right now. Kelly, are you all right? Baby, wait up! Whoa, Kelly, Kelly! Hey, babe, hold on! Hey! What happened back there? I saw something. Something terrible. She was murdered. She, who? Sara? No, the girl in the picture. What picture, babe? Babe, we talked about this with your visions, okay. Remember? The freak out at the macaroni grill? But I saw- - I know you thought you saw something, but I think the best thing to do is just stay here, calm down and wait for Sara to get home. Okay? Just take a deep breath here. Here. I guess. I don't like it when you're so tense. Jeez. (BREATHES DEEPLY) Yeah. I've got an idea. (GIGGLING) SARA: That was amazing! It's my go-to anytime I need some self-love. I don't think I've ever had a grilled cheese that good, like ever. If you think that was good, stick around. I know all the best eateries. Thanks again. A lunch date was exactly what I needed. Oh, so that was a date? Relax. I'm just kidding. I figured you could use a break. How long have you been here now? About two weeks. How many more to go? Till the end of August. Plenty of time for more impromptu lunch dates. Or regular ones. I've been known to eat dinner every now and then. (LAUGHING) (SPLASHING) Did you hear that? I'm afraid so. Stay behind me. (HANDGUN COCKS) Freeze! Put your hands in the air! Whoa, whoa, whoa! EVELYN: I said put your hand in the air! I'd love to, I really would, but... Kelly! What are you doing here? Hey, babe! You know these two? She's my bestie. Sup, Sara? So sorry. Relax! This ain't my first rodeo. Kelly, This is Evelyn. What the hell are you two doing here? Oh, Kelly had one of her feelings, so... I wanted to make sure you were okay! Mm-hm. So how'd you two end up in the pool? I needed to clear my head. Yeah. I'm so sorry about this. There's no need to apologize. No. I mean, you probably think I'm crazy. I think you're overworked, understaffed and in dire need of a break. Say, if you're still open for dinner, how does Friday night sound? It's a date. Great. I'm gonna go now. Catch me some bad guys. I'll let you get back to your friends. All right. See you then. She seems nice! What's that for? Why was the officer so-and-so here in the first place? Evelyn wanted to take me to lunch. Yo! She came just to take you out to lunch? No. I thought someone was messing with me. I don't know. It was nothing. It's so stupid, thinking about it now. Nothing? So, you mean that you didn't make that mess in your room? - No. - Come on, Nick. All I'm saying is that, if I had weird shit going on in my house, and I had a super abusive ex-boyfriend, then maybe I'd tell the police about it. You know he isn't allowed to be near her, nor does he know where she staying, unless you told that creep where she is. You need to cut it out! There's enough bad energy here. We don't need that shitbag involved. He does have a point though. I had a vision in the bedroom. Kelly, no offense, but the last time you had one of your visions, I wound up with a broken arm and chained to a radiator. Look, if it makes you feel any better, I'll talk to Melanie next week and sort everything out. Hey. Everything's going to be okay. (MOANING) DISEMBODIED VOICE: Sara... (MOANING) (SHEETS RUSTLING) Sara... (MOANING) Sara... (MOANING) Sara... I'll always love you... Sara. (STARTLING MUSIC) (GASPS) (FAINT WHISPERING) (DOOR CREAKING) (WOMAN PANTING) (DISTURBING MUSIC) (SNARLING) (WHIMPERING) Stop! You're hurting me! (SNARLING) (SCREAMS) (SNARLS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (DOG WHIMPERS) What's the emergency? Where's Sara? Oh, hey, no, it's all good, it's all good. I just wanted you out here though. Here. I got you one of these. No, I'm good. So, Sara's okay? Yeah, Sara's fine. I just needed to make something up to get you here. Have a seat, have a seat, please. (ALARM RINGING) (UNSETTLING MUSIC) (CRUNCHING) I don't understand. If there's no emergency, why did you need me? Look, I know that Sara has been like, talking to you about the weird stuff that's been going on around her place the last couple nights, you know what I'm saying? I'm not at liberty to discuss that. Not at liberty to discuss. Blah, blah, blah. Look, I know what's going on. It's her ex-boyfriend fucking with her. Go on. Look, the dude's a loose cannon. He's a complete fucking psychopath! (RUMMAGING) (SOFT MUSIC) Hi, guys. We're actually ahead of schedule today. Just finished clearing up the cabinets... (EERIE MUSIC) All right. So I was thinking maybe like you and some of your cop buddies go, I don't know, shake him down or put the heat on him, or stake him out or something, you know? This guy's fucking nuts. So, you want me to threaten Sara's ex? Won't she find out? No, no. I'm not gonna say anything, right? I know you won't, Look, I'm just trying to do what's best for my friend. (JOINTS CRACKING) Fucking Jeff! Nick, Nick! Sick your dog off! Shit! Still wasting your life at that dispensary? Jeff! JEFF: I thought I smelled a pig. Sir, we have a few questions. Yeah, are you fucking with Sara? Sara? (CHUCKLES) Now, why would I fuck with that bitch? Because you're a fucking lunatic. You're obsessed with her! You chained her to a radiator you sick fuck! Get outta my way. I think all that weed is getting to your head. The last time I saw Sara was at the hearing. You know, when she fucked me over. You fucking deserved it, you son of a bitch! Calm down. He's trying to get under your skin. Yeah. Nick. you better listen to Dickless Tracy if you know what's good for you. Sir, where were you last Sunday? (CHUCKLES) Not that it's any of your business, but I was at a dental conference all weekend in Vegas. Stayed at the Marriott Hotel. Ask any of the broads I fucked. I can prove it too. (TAPPING ON DOOR) Melanie? Hi sweetie! I thought I would just pop by and see how things are coming along. Hope I'm not interrupting. I was just working on the kitchen. Please... come in. (CHUCKLING) Looks like you are ahead of schedule. I'm impressed. Very impressed. What's wrong? You look like you just see the ghost. (EERIE MUSIC) This gonna sound crazy, but... could you tell me who this is? She's not in any of the family portraits and, well, I think I have a right to know. Let's discuss this over tea. Enough! I'll be looking into this. And if I find out your story doesn't check out- - What? you're gonna throw another restraining order at me? I don't give a shit. I've moved on to fresher pussy anyway, Sara is yesterday's cunt. Watch it! You're on thin ice. And I know the last thing that you want is the full force of the law on your ass. Nick, I think it's time to go. I'll be in touch. (KISSING NOISE) Toodles. (UNEASY MUSIC) (CHUCKLES) MELANIE: Her name was Natalie, and she owned the house before the last residents. What happened? There was an accident. Natalie had a boyfriend and they were into some weird stuff. Deviants, if you ask me. Well, one night they were playing in bed and things got out of hand. What does that mean? She died. It was a total accident. But this was years ago. By the time I got involved, the house was completely cleared out. Where did you find this? In the master bedroom, under the bed. Is this what has you so spooked? This is ancient history, nothing worth obsessing over. It might do some good to enjoy the weekend. No, I can- - I insist. You're doing such a wonderful job. I hope this is an adequate way of thanking you for your services, on top of what we've already agreed on of course. Melanie! What? I know you can use the money. But you have to promise me you're gonna take some me time and stop lingering on the past, okay? You know what helps me clear my head? A nice warm soak in the tub and a tall glass of wine. SARA: Bye, Melanie. Think about it. (EXHALES SHARPLY) (SOFT MUSIC) (LIGHTER CLICKS) (WATER SLOSHING) (PHONE RINGING) (STARTLING MUSIC) (GASPS) (WATER SPLASHING) (SARA SCREAMING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (PHONE RINGING) (SPITS) Hello? Date? Oh, no, I'll be ready. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Wow! You are stunning. (CHUCKLES) So where are we going? I was thinking grilled cheese. (LAUGHING) After you. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (EERIE WHISPERING) (BLINDS SLAM) You've been pretty busy these past few days. Sara? SARA: Hm? I said you've been pretty these past few days. Oh, yeah. Lots of packing to be done. I'm glad you were able to make time for me. I was getting kinda worried. Are you okay Sara? Oh, yeah. Sorry. It's just been a crazy week for me. I'm a little distracted. (GEAR SHIFTS) We can reschedule if you don't want to do this. (GENTLE MUSIC) I like you. I really do. And... this is all new to me. I mean, I dated girls in college, but that was before... Anyway, I'm sorry for acting so off lately. You have nothing to apologize for. I've been through some serious shit, and I don't think I'm over it yet, but I'm trying, I really am. I've been letting it dictate my life for too long and... I feel like I'm losing my mind sometimes. I just... I don't want to be a burden. Sara, you are not a burden. Whatever you're going through, I'll be here. I'm not gonna let anything hurt you, okay? Especially after what happened to you. I'm sorry. Nick told me what happened, and it's fucked up. I mean, it's really fucked up what that creep did to you. He's an abuser. It's how they hold power over you. They forced their way into your brain and refuse to leave. You can't let this break you. You know, for a rookie, you sure do seem to know a lot. (CHUCKLES) They play a lot of daytime talk shows in the break room. I know how to treat a lady, and it's with respect. (CHUCKLES) You make me sound like I'm your grandma. I'll have you know my grandma has nothing but kind words to say about me. We can go visit her. She lives close by. - Let's go. - No, no, no. Let's go eat. I'm fucking starving. Gram-grams! Language! (LAUGHING) Let's go eat. (GEAR SHIFTS) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) (CAR HUMMING) So, am I two for two? You certainly are the connoisseur of comfort food. I'll take that as a compliment. Sara... Would you like to do this again? Absolutely. Oh, my friends and I are having a little barbecue this weekend. You should come by. I'd like that. I'd invite you in but... baby steps. Of course. That's a pretty big step. See you Saturday. See you then. (EERIE MUSIC) DISEMBODIED VOICE: I will always love you, Sara. (UNSETTLING MUSIC) Sara... Sara... (LAMP SWITCH CLICKS) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (MUSIC CRESCENDOS) (BANGING ON DOOR) Sara, open up! SARA: God! - Do you ever use the door? - Move! Kelly, what is all this? Research. I spent all afternoon in the library, digging up everything I could on this house. You're gonna want to sit down for this. When you hear what happened right here in this room, holy fucking shit! I already know. You do? Yes. Melanie told me about the accident. Accident? There was no accident. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (DISTURBING MUSIC) (EERIE WHISPERS) Please! - Please untie me! - Shh. Please! Just shut up. I'll do anything. Yes. Yes, I know you will. You think you can reject me? I was a saint to you. Just tell me, tell me, what do they have that I don't have, huh? Just tell me that one thing! Just answer that! What is it? What is it? Am I too old? Am I too fat? What is it? Just tell me! Just tell me that one thing! Please, please, please! When all those boy toys break your heart, suddenly I'm not invisible anymore, and you can come crying to good old, reliable James. "I'll just cry my crocodile tears on him." And for what? Not even thank you? How about some gratitude? Please. I thought you were my friend! No, no. No. I'm not the villain. I'm not a villain. I'm a nice guy. I'm a nice guy. You know it! I treated... I treated you with the utmost respect... and adoration. I can't get what I want, what I deserve? (GIRL CRYING) One date. One date was more than fair. That's all I asked, and you laughed at me! No! I'm sorry! I just thought you were my friend! Shh, shh, shh. I'm gonna give you one more chance to tell me why. Okay. Just one more chance. I'm sorry. You're right. You were there for me. You've always been there for me. I love you. I love you. I really love you. Please! You made me a whore! (CRYING) Just tell me you love me! Just... tell me you love me! - Please! - Why won't you love me? (CRYING) Please! I love you, I really love you! - Lie! - No, please! (GRUNTING) (BLOOD SPURTING) You broke my heart! It's only fair I do the same! (BLOOD SPURTS) (WHEEZING) No, no, no, no, no. No, no. No, no, no, don't die. Don't die, don't die. I love you. I love you. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) MAN: Police! Open up! (DOOR BANGS OPEN) (EERIE WHISPERING) (DISTURBING MUSIC) KELLY: I think it's safe to say Melanie lied to you. Oh my God! This room, this whole house, has bad energy. I knew something was up last time we were here, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was I was seeing. Now we know. What are you saying? This house needs to be cleansed. Isn't that what I'm doing? No. Cleanse, like we're sage. We need to ward off the evil spirits. Nick will be here in the morning with everything I'll need. Kelly. And if it sweetens the deal, we'll stick around and help some of the cleaning from the barbecue. Fine. We both know you're not gonna let me say no. But can you helped me pack up the stuff? I don't want to sleep in this room anymore. (EERIE WHISPERS) (WHOOSHING) May this person... and space... be cleaned by the smoke... of these fragrant plants. And may that smoke... carry our prayers... to the heavens. What is he doing? A person's energy is like a fragrance. It can linger around long after the person has left. And this ritual is a way to clear the air So you can say buh-bye to evil murder ghosts. No, but like... what is he burning? Oh, it's sage. May the person and space be cleansed by the smoke. This is a lot of smoke. Should we open a window or something? Shit! I knew I was forgetting something! Everything has to be open if expect this to work! Can you get the other rooms? Hurry! Before it burns out! May this person and space be cleansed by the smoke of these fragrant plants. And made that smoke carry our prayers to the heavens. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (UNSETTLING MUSIC) (BLINDS CLACK) SARA: Watch it! You're gonna burn the house down. SARA: I know what I'm doing! That looks super burnt to me! Okay. Then you take over. MELANIE: What's burning. - Oh hey! - Hey, Sara. Hope I'm not too late. I decided to pick up a few weenies on the way. Did she just call them weenies? Try not to burn these! Nothing worse than a burnt weenie. Nevermind her. She's just trying to embarrass me. Oh, but you turn the prettiest shade of pink when I succeed. Thank you for coming. You really didn't have to. I wanted to see you. Oh wow. What? Kelly's right. It is the cutest shade of pink. Oh God. (CHUCKLING) (CHUGGING) Whoa there! Everything okay? Holy shit! (SPITS) (COUGHING) You guys okay? We're doing great! Thanks! Officer Bennett! God damn! Think she knows the Heimlich? (UPBEAT MUSIC) So I said, "That's not my nurse. That's my mother!" (LAUGHING) You got a few weeks left. Do you think you can pull it off? Hell yeah! I'm a make this house my bitch! (LAUGHING) Oh my God, I have a great idea! Truth or dare! Truth or dare? Do you need me to explain the rules, Officer Elevyn? You either truth or dare. All right. I'm down. Okay. Who wants to go first? I'm going first! Truth or dare, Evelyn? Truth. Coward. You don't have to if you don't want to. No, it's cool. Have you ever shot anyone before? Damn! Kelly! Actually, no. You're the first person I ever pulled a gun on, if I'm being honest. I feel so special now! Sara, you're next! Nick. Sup? I dare you- - You have to ask truth their dare! Whatever. Truth or dare? Pick dare. All right, dare. I dare you... to give Evelyn a lap dance. (LAUGHING) Shit. (GROANS) I should have picked truth. SARA: You can always take a drink. Oh, no, no, no. Come on, come on. Come, come, come. Woo! NICK: All right. You ready for this shit? EVELYN: Yup. I'm really sorry. I'm not sorry. (LAUGHING) (GRUNTING) (CLAPPING) How low can you go? (LAUGHING) This is the real money maker. (LAUGHING) (HOLLERING) You can spank it if you want to. Okay, Magic Mike. I think that's enough. Sorry. To be continued. (LAUGHING) Did you enjoy the show? Tremendously. I bet you did. I think that means it's your turn. Kelly! Yes. EVELYN: Truth or dare? I pick truth. Sara says you think you're a psychic? Is that true? Bitch, I know I'm a psychic! There is energy and vibrations all around us, and there's people who are gifted with the ability to channel that shit. I happen to be one of them. I'm clairvoyant. Self-diagnosed. I can get a sense of something by touching it, like it's history and thoughts and shit. Really? Mm-hm. Huh. Okay. What am I thinking? Oh! I see. It's so clear now. What? You're thinking... thinking... Come on! That you need another beer! (LAUGHING) She's right! I was totally thinking that! For real, she's good. She's seriously good. It's like impressive. I'm not even kidding. All right, all right. Sara, you're up. Truth or dare. Mm... Dare. All right. I dare you... to kiss Evelyn. Yes! Finally taking things up a notch! I don't know. Oh, come on, come on. It's not like we haven't seen the oogly eyes you guys been given each other all night, right? KELLY: I think you just want to see two hot chicks make out. Well, duh. Obviously, yeah. But that's not why I'm doing it. I'm doing it 'cause you guys clearly like each other. You haven't even kissed yet, you know? So like... get it off your shoulders. Look, it's obvious you two have chemistry, right? (EERIE WHISPERS) Right? So... And Sara's... Sara's... KELLY: Sweetie? You okay? (DISTURBING MUSIC) (EERIE WHISPERS) SARA: Nick? What was I saying? You were talking about us. Seeing you together makes me want to blow my brains out! Excuse me? (EERIE WHISPERS) (STUTTERING) (LOUD BANG) You disgust me! KELLY: This isn't funny, Nick! Sara, you're so beautiful. Sara, you're so beautiful! Sara, you're so beautiful! Nick! Are you crazy? Don't call me crazy! (SLAMMING HEAD) Shut your mouth, you fucking whore! (SPLASHING) EVELYN: No! (CHOKING) Nick, stop! - Let go of me. - Stop! Nick, let go of me. Nick, you're gonna kill her! Stop! (DEMONIC WHISPERS) Nick! Please, Nick! (CHOKING) Don't you see, Sara? I love you. I've always loved you. Nick, stop. Nick, you're gonna kill her! Nick! Nick! (CHOKING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) James. Stop. Please. James... Please stop. What did you... Who did you call me? (BOTTLE SHATTERS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Are you all right? Kelly! (SPLASHING) Kelly! - You got her? - Yeah. (SCREAMING) Evelyn! (WATER BUBBLING) Kelly! Kelly, please wake up! (WATER BUBBLING) (STARTLING MUSIC) What happened? Murder? A fucking demon? It's much worse than I thought. I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. I thought I was losing my mind until... I should have known. All the clues were there what this really was. What is it? It's an incubus, and a vile one at that. What's an incubus? You said it yourself. It's a fucking demon. It preys on your sexuality, usually when you sleep, but I've never heard of one possessing someone before. I thought we cleansed the house. Hon, demons don't just scare off with sage. They latch onto you like a parasite, feeding off your angst, desire, sucking all this energy they can get like some kind of mosquito. And with your past... What? Let's just say you're particularly juicy vein for this mosquito. This is insane! A demon? Do you have some rational explanation for all this? No, but... I saw something... in the water. It was like a shadow of a man. There's our demon. So what do we do? There's only one thing we can do. Banish the demon. What? How? There's rituals I know that might cause the spirit to leave us and never return. Might? And you know how to do this? I've only studied it, okay? I haven't actually needed to perform one before now. So what do we do? Get the fuck out of here. No, I can't just abandon my job. I'm sorry. Fine. Nick and I will get our supplies. We'll meet here tomorrow. For what? We're gonna throw everything and the kitchen sink at this fucker and exorcize the shit out of it. I'm not sleeping here another night. No, you're staying with me. No better protection than from a cop. No, I can't. No, Sara. She's right. You need to be protected now more than ever. Fine. I'll go get my things. I'll go with you. (MUMBLING) Kelly, where are you? KELLY: I'm right here, sweetie. Kelly? Kelly! I had the worst nightmare that I was... (HANDCUFFS JANGLING) Shit. Oh, shit! Oh, fuck! It wasn't a dream. Babe! Baby, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to do that shit! Babe, babe, babe, babe, please. Please, please. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I know. I know it wasn't you. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (SOMBER MUSIC) Oh, thank you! Oh, no. These are for me. You're taking the bed. I just put a new sheet down. No, I can't. Nonsense. It's the least I can do. And you need your rest. (SOFT MUSIC) Whoa. Are you sure you want to do this? All things considered. You're so beautiful. Are you sure you'll be okay? Yeah. So, about last night... if everything works out, I'd really like to see you again. I'd like that. KELLY: That takes care of the bedrooms. Now onto the living. Oh, was I interrupting? So, shouldn't we be getting Sara out of here? Shouldn't she be in a safe house or something? How's a safe house gonna stop a sex demon from finding her? No, she's right. We... I need to do this. All right. I'll check in on my break. Go catch some bad guys. EVELYN: Will do. Someone had a temper tantrum. Sara, if you could clear up some space, that'll be great. Like this? A little more. Is that a dream catcher? KELLY: Yes. They've been known to catch deans as well. (CHALK SCRAPING) And you're drawing a pentagram? I'm just trying to cover all my bases here. Every culture has its own banishment ritual. So why not try them all? There's no such thing as overkill when it comes to demons. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Shit! Do you have any matches? I'll go get some. You, for real, though, babe, you sure you know what you're doing? (OMINOUS MUSIC) Where are your clothes? We need to entice a demon with our bodies. Now, I need your hair. Uh, what? No. Okay. Then pee in this bottle. How much hair exactly? (SCISSORS SNIP) What is that? It's a witch's bottle. In old times, people would make these and bury them under their houses to capture demons and ghosts and to prevent witches from casting spells on them. Okay. And how are we using it? We're going to bait the demon out of hiding, then capture it in this bottle. Kind of like a supernatural fishing line. Or a vacuum cleaner. Awesome. What's the bait? Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. Now, go change into your sexiest underwear. (SIGHS) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) What are you doing? I don't want to be the only one left out. Sara, lie down. This will protect you from the demon once it reveals itself. It is very crucial that you do not leave that circle for any reason whatsoever. (WINDOW SLIDING) (BLINDS RUSTLING) Bingo. And the sage? Just some extra production. Hopefully. Kind of playing it by ear at this point. Can never have too much sage. And now, you sleep. What? You need to be in a dream state. Just trust me, okay? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (SNIFFS) (EXHALES HEAVILY) (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (UNSETTLING MUSIC) I call upon the spirit that is haunting this house. Please. spirit, make your presence known. Cold! It's cold! Sorry. Spirits, I beg, nay, demand, that you make your presence known. (GROWLING) (DEMON SNARLING) We present to you and offering, spirit. The object of your desire. She awaits you. You like that? You like that, bitch? (DEMON SNARLING) Now make your presence known! (BUILDING CREAKING) What the fuck? (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (DEMON SNARLING) (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) NICK: Come on, Sara! Sara, fight it, come on! Please, James! KELLY: Make the sage! (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) That's right! I know who you are! And I'm not afraid of you! (EERIE WHISPERS) (DEMON SNARLING) (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (GRUNTING) Hey! Kelly! Jeff! What are you doing here? I'm not Jeff! No. No! You're trying to take something that belongs to me. It's only fair that I do the same. Nick! (NECK SNAPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SIREN BLARING) EVELYN: Sara! Sara! (BANGS ON DOOR) Open the door! Let me in! Sara! Enough! I've missed you, Sara. Why did you leave me? EVELYN: Open the door! (ELECTRICITY BUZZING) I missed you, Sara. Why did you leave me? All I ever did was love you. Was that so wrong? Why won't you love me? Love? You want to talk about love? This isn't love! You never loved me! You were just using me, you coward! I know who you are, James! You're a fucking man-child that didn't get his way, so you murdered her! You hid in the bathroom after you killed her, you coward! Does that make you feel like a big, tough man, James? I'm not afraid of you! (SNARLING) (HANDGUN FIRING) Evelyn! Are you all right? (SNARLING) Fucking whore! (HANDGUN FIRING) (SOMBER MUSIC) Sara? Call an ambulance. They'll be here soon, okay? (SOFT MUSIC) How you doing? I never shot anyone before. I'll be okay. How are you? I don't know. It's weird. What's that? I'm finally free. I don't ever have to deal with that monster ever again. You're in shock. I think... I think I love you. You're definitely in shock. (SOFTLY CRYING) Did it work? I think so. Since we got the host, that should have also killed the demon latched to it. I think it goes without saying, I'm moving back in with you. I'll radio it in. But first, I want to make sure there's nothing here that can incriminate either of you. I thought you already called. Oh yeah. Right. (UNEASY MUSIC) Sorry. Just a little bit rattled still. Hey, Evelyn... Yes? I changed my mind. I know I love you. I love you to. I'll always love you. (UNSETTLING MUSIC) What'd you just say? I said, I'll always love you. (HANDGUN FIRES) (EERIE WHISPERS) Evelyn? Evelyn, please don't do this. Evelyn, you have to fight this, please! I know you're in there. (SNARLING) Don't do this. Please don't do this. Please, it's me! It's me, it's Sara! I love you! Please! Evelyn. I'm sorry. Evelyn's no longer with us. Please! Please don't do this! It's Sara. I love you! I love you! I love you! Please. Please don't do this. Please. It's me. (HANDGUN FIRES) (EERIE WHISPERS) (DISTURBING MUSIC) I love you. I'll always love you. MELANIE: Welcome! (LAUGHING) All right, so here are your keys! MAN: Thank you! Congratulations! You're officially homeowners. Oh my god! (LAUGHING) Now remember, the pool is heated. There's a school down the street. Everything is super safe. Oh, hello Officer Bennett! Ma'am. Officer, is something wrong? Good morning, folks. I was just driving through the neighborhood. Thought I'd swing by, introduce myself. Oh. How very kind. I'm Paul. This is my wife. Lorissa. LORISSA: Good morning, ma'am. Good morning. Oh, I'm sorry. Officer Evelyn Bennett at your service. I just wanted to let the two of you know that I'll personally be keeping watch over you, and I hope you enjoy your new home. LORISSA: Oh. Personally keeping watch over us? Are you- - MELANIE: Why don't you to go in ahead and settle down? (CHUCKLING) Kitchen. Ah, young love. Warms the heart. Any updates on Sara? We're expanding our search to neighboring countries, but the odds are against us. You know, it's just so weird. She's not the type to just up and vanished like that. Thought I know her so well. You might want to check in with her hippie friend. I know that they were close. I'm sure she's safe. Probably just got in over her head and bailed. Well, I'm off. Take care! (DISTURBING MUSIC) So what do you think? It's beautiful. - Thanks so much. - Thank you so much. Everything looks great? - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh. (CHUCKLES) (DISTURBING MUSIC) (CAR STARTS) (DISTURBING MUSIC) (EERIE WHISPERING) (INTENSE MUSIC)
