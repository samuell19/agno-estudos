Over 5,000 years before Christ an amazing thing happens that would change the course of human history. Hidden from us by misunderstanding, mistranslation and clouded in mythology the birth of religion on this planet was no mere accident. It was the result of an alien invasion on a vast scale and it sparked the worship of the ancient gods. Those gods are the oldest recorded figures of worship anywhere in history. They are the root of all the major world religions. They gave rise to the great powers of Egypt, Mesopotamia and more. They spread outwards around the world and were the genesis of a special holy blood line that remains with us today. One of their descendants would be caught, beaten and crucified. And yet he would rise from his grave unrecognizable and accompanied by messengers of light. He would ascend in the sky having cast off his shrouded skin. His bloodline would give rise to the royal families of the entire world. His bloodline would be protected, defended and would control the globe. He was a descendant of the great serpent elite who came to earth as beings of light to teach mankind. He was a descendant of the great giant killer David, a memory of a great battle that was fought between the serpent elite and the sons of alien and man. They were known as giants in the land. The aliens escaped earth but left behind their seed and tools of power and communication. It is prophesied that they shall return and the signs are growing daily they have returned and are right now dealing with their own elite bloodline. The men in power. This is the untold story of a very real and ancient alien invasion. In Africa today there are the remains of the oldest form of worship anywhere on the planet. It is a cave in the shape of a huge serpent. All around there are pieces of stone fashioned into thousands of small scales. This is the place of worship for the serpent. This is where man first came into contact with the aliens. The discovery of this one location surprised the world. Nobody expected original worship to be that of the serpent and yet it is within every single religion. It is in all the myths of the world. And they all tell the same story. In the beginning the serpent was the wise one. The only animal in the Bible to speak freely with his own mind and voice. The tempter and yet also the holder of ultimate wisdom and the elixir of life. Mankind in comparison to this remarkable animal appeared foolish. From that day forward the serpent would control man. The very genetic makeup of mankind altered from this moment. We cannot say exactly when, we cannot pinpoint the so called Garden of Eden in time but we can piece together the remarkable story of the moment the serpent aliens came from the skies. We can uncover the story of what happened next and how it has affected our own time. The truth is aliens do walk among us right now. To many the very idea that the serpent is hidden within our religions and mythology will seem bizarre. In Christianity and other faiths it is revealed and this itself is a folk memory of a fearful and waring past between mankind and the serpent. Nevertheless, the historical truth is that the serpent is there and it is the root of all major religions. This has been proven again and again both from scriptures and archeology. The following information is vital to our understanding of this history for it helps us to uncover the origin and role of this ancient invasion. This is a journey across time and space to unlock and reveal the hidden serpent race. The easiest and most clear way to realize that the serpent is hidden in our lives is to actually understand the language of the serpent itself. We need to get to the roots. The snake is known in the language of Canaan as Ab, Oub, Oph, Op, Eph and Ev. Amazing in the Mayan language Can means serpent as in Kukulcan, the bird serpent. And just as in the ancient Sumerian Akan, in the Scottish can for serpent which is where we get the word Canny like the wise snake. Vulcan, the Roman god of fire comes from the Babylonian can for serpent and vul for fire. Showing an etymological link across thousands of miles. The aspect of fire being included in the word is a clue to the origins of the serpent and its worship. For the ancients came with fire. There are no real snakes on earth that are also fire and so it must mean something quite different. Perhaps similar to that fire or light seen in the modern day UFO sightings. At the very center of the Christian world the Vatican. Comes from the words vatis for prophet and can for serpent. Making the Vatican a place of serpent prophecy. The very book of Christians across the world, the Bible, is full of the serpent and its inclusion is very interesting for it reveals how the serpent was seen. The oracle of King Saul was called One that hath Ob or the Priestess of Ob. A word that means serpent. The serpent worshipers of Moses time and era were known as Hivites derived from Hivia or serpent the root of Eve. Hivites became Ophites, the early Christian Gnostic serpent worshipers who claimed affinity with the Christians in the second century AD. Indeed the very children of Israel intermarried with them and served their gods. This is very revealing stuff. Intermarriage and worship of the serpent gods. Today we can easily replace the word gods with aliens. They were also known as Baalim from the god Baal. Baal was an abbreviation of Ob-El the serpent god or shining serpent. The shining aspect of the serpent reveals a subtle clue. The serpent was indeed seen in the sky and shone down upon us. This is why in Egypt for instance you will see the sun or Aten wrapped with a snake and why the serpent was worldwide seen as a symbol of the sun. It was these shining ones or serpents which were the lights in the sky that descended to earth. They were the lights that our ancestors saw in the sky. The sun, moon and stars. But these lights came down to earth and settled amongst us. The lights were the ships, the craft of the strange serpent like humanoids that stepped off and walked among mankind. The Greeks called Baal &quot;the liar&quot; which means a dragon or great serpent. Baal is the ethereal Babylonian version of the gods Enlil and Murdoch; the same Baal seen throughout the Bible. So the Baal in the Bible is a Babylonian serpent god. One of the ancient lights of wisdom that descended to earth. The European Beltane should be rendered Balatan. Both words signifying the dragon or serpent. In fact, Tanit was the patron goddess of carthage in Northern Africa who was also associated with the Tree of Life like Ishtar and Astarte and she definitely crossed cultures into Europe becoming the root of the word Easter. The name Tanit means serpent lady and she is found on many coins in Carthage associated with the Caduceus and symbolizing the role of Tanit in life, death and rebirth. She is basically the same as the Queen of Heaven; Astarte, Isis and Mary. All of these deities and names go back to Babylonian beliefs of serpent worship which in turn goes across the Egypt and Mesopotamia in general towards the African ancient serpent cults. The very place that the original shining ones descended to earth and began their teaching of mankind. Christianity then is related to the most ancient serpent worship known and if it were not for the destructive covering up of huge amounts of historical data by the Christians then this would have been all the more obvious. It is a fact that the Christians were ashamed of this link and did all they could to destroy it. Not least because it would reveal their own deity to be of serpent origin itself. Years later as we shall see, the serpent bloodline would emerge again in the line of the Moravians and again the Christians would fight a battle to subdue them. A general term for early Christian Gnostics was Ophites which means serpent worshipers. It was this group that wrote the New Testament. Epiphanes said the Ophites sprung out of the Nications and Gnostics and were so called from the serpent which they worshiped. The taught that the ruler of this world was of a gigantic form and the Ophites attribute all wisdom to the Serpent of Paradise and say that he was the author of knowledge of men. An amazing declaration which speaks volumes. The guardians of the very history in religion, note become Christianity, was in fact based on and fostered by those who worshiped the ancient wise serpent who came and taught mankind. The ruler of this world was of draconic form. It was the dragon, the winged serpent, the shining serpent that could fly. It was ultimately wise and should be worshipped as a god. As if in memory of the power of the serpent bloodline the blood itself was symbolically ingested. A ritual cup was used known as the cup of the Agatha Damon, meaning simply good serpent. This serpent consecrated cup of wine was handed around after super just like at the last supper of Christ and was received with much shouting and joyousness. The hymns sung via the serpent to the supreme father was just the same as the one sung in the memory of the python at Delphi on the 7th day of the week. Now thousands of years later Christians still take the cup of Christ who is called the good serpent by the Gnostics. This modern ritual is none other than the original renamed. Cup of the Sacred Serpent which gives the body and blood of our oldest god. The body and blood of the ancient serpent race. A third century Persian teacher known as Manis who said that Christianity had got things wrong and he was here to put it right attempted to revive these old ways. Regardless of the Christian attempts to kill of Manichaeism it survived until the 13th Century. He is said to have revived Ophiolatreia or serpent worship where he taught that Christ was an incarnation of the great serpent who glided over the cradle of the Virgin Mary when she was asleep at the age of a year and a half. But the worship of the serpent was much more ancient than even Manis stated. In Britain the serpent god was Who, the dragon ruler of the world. A statement remarkably similar to that of the Ophites. The Druid was known as Anater. Now known as an Ater. And as the Ater was the symbol of the god Who the Druids were Ophites of the original stock. They worshiped also Bali or Baal, so in this respect the Druids were probably the last truly serpent worshiping priests in Europe. A remnant of ancient days long forgotten but remembered in words and deeds. According to Herodotus a sacred serpent was fed honey cakes once a month at the Acropolis in Athens. These honey cakes were marked Omphalos The superstition of the Omphalos was widespread like the serpent. Belief from India to Greece, it is a bos or orb with spiral lines thought to represent serpents coiled. There are similar markings on ancient stone monuments across the world. To the Etruscans of ancient Italy the Omphalos was seen as a route to another world. It was placed in a trench called a mundus and the first fruits offered into the trench which was then covered by a huge stone. The entire city was centered on the spot with all roads leading to and from it. This is a remnant of the idea that serpent race came from another world and the Omphalos a representation of the devices used for travel. Probably the most famous Omphalos is the one now in the Museum at Delphi. In Greek history the Delphic oracle was called Pytho or Python the Snake and she was active for over 1,000 years, getting involved in anything from mundane day to day prophecies to matter of state. As throughout the history of the mystical serpent it has been associated with powers of future sight known to us today as precognition. An indication that the serpent is associated strongly with prophecy is the stark fact that the words for divination in Hebrew, Arabic and Greek all mean serpent. This alone indicates that Hebrew, Arabic and Greek are following the same beliefs over a vast period of time. According to Ferguson a 19th Century writer, when we first meet with serpent worship either the wilderness of Cyanine, the groves of Epidaurus or in the Sumerian Huts the serpent is always the Agatha Damon which in ancient Egypt presided over the affairs of men as the guardian spirit of their houses. Was the Asp of Rano, the snake headed goddess which is represented as nursing the young princes. That the idea of health was intimately associated with the serpent is shown by the crown formed of the asp or sacred thermoses. Having been given particularly to isis, A goddess of life and healing. And according to Hargrave Jennings an Ophi Latrea these were no doubt intended to symbolize eternal life. This is revealing. For one thing that is definitely associated with these original serpents is eternal life. To mankind these serpents appear to live forever. They outlive man. They also were great healers and were said to be able to cure man of his ills. In the serpent and siva worship Seasonal and Wake remarks about the Muslim saint of upper Egypt is still thought to appear under the form of a serpent and to cure the diseases which afflict the pilgrims of his shrine. In the same book we hear of one of the four idols of Madagascar whose emissaries are serpents. He is regarded as a physician and thought to expel epidemic diseases much akin to the Greek serpent deity Asclepius. This is a very revealing paragraph for it gives us insight into the amazing power and technology that these serpent beings possessed. As god sacred, powerful and almighty who kills and makes alive, who heals the sick and prevents diseases and pestilence, who can cause thunder and lightening to strike their victims or prevent their fatality can cause rain in abundance when wanted or can withhold it so as to ruin the crops of rice. He is also celebrated for his knowledge of the past and future and for ihs capacity of discovering whatever is healed or concealed. Roma Haveli has basically all the elements of the Agatha Damon, the sacred serpent in the one god. He is like many other serpent deities in charge of the weather. He has knowledge and wisdom and above all he can heal, resurrect and disperse disease. These are all elements that thousands of people across the world have said are within the power of aliens. In Islam the snake is always seen as being closely associated with life. In fact, the word El Hayah meaning snake is close to El Hiat meaning the live giving principle. The Prophet Muhammad is said to have spoken of the strange and powerful angelic beings known as Gen, where we get Geni as being of three kinds. One of which was as a serpent. Indeed the white Gen are said to be formed from the irises of the serpent Setsuna's eyes. The king of the Gen was Zhumsheid who just happens to be famous for having a beautiful cup of elixir. The Resplendent Zhum as he was known was the first to organize society and it was one of the first legendary rulers of Persia. Wine and sugar were made for the first time. He was the first to construct roads and build ships. During his long reign Zhumshide received a warning that three severe winters, heavy snowfalls would cover the earth. And all creation would be destroyed. Very much like the flood of Noah. Zhumshide followed the divine order and construct a Var which is a fortress into which he took the best men, women, animals and plants to reproduce and replenish the earth after the snows had melted. Hi reign was remembered for its great prosperity but also his pride. He became a sinner and he was defeated and killed by the serpent king Zahhak. A later king of this dynasty Faradon in turn killed the serpent king. Fardun is also credited with the discovery of the art of medicine and healing. The whole story of Zohauc and Zhumshide is the struggle between the culture of Persia and the invading ancient serpent race from Syria which was seen as the evil. It is the story of powerful ancient serpent rulers who came to earth, taught mankind, mated with humans and eventually fell into a situation of war with their offspring. The exact same story we find in Sumari, Egypt, the Bible and numerous other cultures around the globe. A memory of an ancient invasion before recorded history. We must now move on to the mythical progenitors of the whole of the human race. A story of two people created by the god of ancient times to populate the earth. A hybrid species, part god and part of the earth itself. Remarkably the origin is found to be related to serpent worship from their Sumerian origins. The word Hevia is the root of Eve and means female serpent. It is connected to the same Arabic root which means both life and serpent. The Persians even call the constellations serpents, the little Ava or Eve. In old Acadian Ad signifies father and Adam was closely associated in legend with Seth, Saturn and South who were all associated strongly as serpents. Abel the son of Adam and Eve means serpent shining and Cain was thought to be of serpent decent simply because he was. The other and important in note is that Adam and Eve were initially immortal and Eve gained her wisdom via the serpent on the Tree of Knowledge and Life. According to Rabbinical tradition Cain was not the son of Adam at all but rather the son of Asmodeus the serpent spirit. In conclusion, Adam and Eve and even their sons are serpents. The very so called origin of humanity is in fact based upon those Sumerian shinning ones that came from the sky in the form of serpents. The origin of humanity is from the line of serpents. American indigenous people call the snake anita wahay or supernatural. It holds a high place in their worship because it is magical. It controls the rain and thunder, has dominance over other animals and plants. It is no different to the serpent in other parts of the world. Why would this be? In a world where historians tell us these cultures never met that they cannot be related in any way and yet the belief systems are the same. There is in fact a clue, a big clue in the tales and it reveals the origin of these serpent beliefs. The rattlesnake was according to legend once a man. Alluding to the ancient incoming serpent race of antiquity. This man was transformed into a rattlesnake in order to bring salvation to the human race and save him. Yet again, it is the savior of mankind. Even the Cherokee Indians are afraid of killing the rattlesnake and will ask for pardon from the snakes ghost should they do so. There is even a tradition that if the snake is hung on a tree for three days it will bring rain. Remarkably similar to the Christian tale and even a link with Yahweh the rain god. These are the same because these are the same serpent deities influencing society across the globe. In mankind's efforts to mimic their ancient deities they began a peculiar tradition. Circumcision. There are wall carvings in Egypt showing circumcision being practiced. The Egyptians held the belief that when the snake shed its skin it had undergone rebirth. It was symbolic of attaining new life, of being born again. It was a mirror of their greatest god. The Egyptian priest in a mock ritual of the serpent shedding its skin therefore removed the foreskin of the male and so the male was born again like the snake. This practice then spread to the Semitic peoples. Arabs and Jews in later times. Most probably via the emerging worshipers of the serpent elite. The fact is that this practice goes back to ancient Sumaria, the home of the original serpent shining ones who came down from the sky. The home of the ancient watchers. The original home of the angels of the Bible who were shining messengers of the gods and whose visage was that of the serpent. There is no denying that all the records we have of these shining ones record them as having descended from the heavens, to be incredibly wise and powerful, to have set up a special guardian race called The Watchers who then went on to mate with humanity and create a hybrid race. That hybrid race is known across the world in folklore as the giants. History tells us quite simply that this was a crime and the original aliens, the shining ones did battle with the giants and brought about a great cataclysm. This is not science fiction. This is the recorded history ignored by historians because it does not conform to their own belief systems. The Ponti Tantra are five books of animal and magical tales and one of India's most influential contributions to world culture. Said to have been compiled between the third and fifth century AD, however it is believed not without reason that they were already very ancient by then. These stories substantially influence western Europe via Arabic translations and oral trade. In it we can see the links between the Braman culture and the idea of serpents decent for the royal families. Devasarmon a Brauman had a childless wife who wept constantly for children. This indicates the sterile nature of the Brahman at this age. One Devasarmon said to his wife, stop your grieving, behold I was offering a sacrifice for the birth of a son when an invisible being said to me in the clearest words; Brahman you shall begranted a son and he shall surpass all men in beauty and virtue and good fortune shall be his. The Brahman's wife was overjoyed at this tale. However, in the course of time she gave birth to a snake. All her servants cried throw it away. However, the doting mother picked it up and cared for it lovingly. One day she got upset when watching the wedding of a young couple saying to her husband, you treat me with contempt because you are not making any effort at all to arrange a wedding for my dead child. The Brahman replied, I would have to go to the depths of Hell and beseech Pasuki the king of snakes for who else you fool would give his daughter in marriage to a snake. But wives can be very convincing sometimes. And the Brahman ended up traveling far and wide to seek out a bride. He spent the night in a place of Anaga or serpent worshipers. And in the morning told his host why he had come. Amazingly the host had the perfect daughter and the Brahman returned home gleefully with the girl and her servants. After an initial shock at the thought of marrying the snake the girl eventually came around and promised to marry him. She showed the snake respect during the early days, serving him milk and food. But one night the snake left his basket and crept into bed but the girl thought it was a man and she was terrified. Until she realized it really was her husband who had changed shape. The Brahman had seen everything and early in the morning before the snake could creep back into his snakeskin he stole it and burned it. And never again could the son take the form of a snake. A story such as this could not be clearer and it is based upon much older myths from more ancient sources. It is the stark tale of the origin of the hybrid species between mankind and the alien race. True modern scientific genetics can clearly be seen in this very ancient tale. An invisible being descends and impregnates the wife who goes on to give birth to a serpent's child. There is no difference here to the tales of Mary and Joseph and the birth of the one the Gnostics would call the Good Serpent. There are hundreds more like it across the world relating to the descent from serpent aliens. There is little wonder when these serpent tribes were spreading their belief around the world before Egypt had even been thought of. Now we have seen the traces of the alien invasion of the shining serpents in the mythology and history of the world. It's time to see if there are any ancient traces of them in artifacts and symbolism. The fact is once our eyes are opened to the existence of a massive world wide serpent worship history we cannot fail to see them. Almost everything about the mythology of the alien serpent race reveals that they were the gods who gave life and no symbol reveals this more than the Ankh of ancient Egypt. The Ankh is a simple t-cross surmounted by an oval called the Rue which means quite simply gateway to another world. This enigmatic symbol of Egypt represents eternal life and it was often found in the names of pharaohs such as Tutankhamun. The symbol is often depicted being held by a god to a pharo giving him life or held by a pharaoh to his people giving them life. This basically set aside the immortals from the mortals. For anyone wearing or carrying the Onk was one of the genetically different race. The pharaoh was god on earth and so he held his own symbol of the sun and the serpent to his people. It is the loop, the rue, or gateway of the Onk which is held by the immortals to the nostrils. This is the same as the biblical god breathing life into the nostrils of Adam. The Onk outlived Egyptian domination and was widely used by the Christians as their first cross but in this symbol holds a clue to the secret of the serpent. Philo said that the Phoenician alphabet are those formed by means of serpents and adored them as the supreme gods, the rulers of the universe. Thus bringing to mind the god Foth who again is related to the worship of serpents and who created the alphabet. The rulers of the universe not only gave us life but also the very alphabet. They taught us how to communicate. Bunson in the 19th Century thought the forms and movements of serpents were employed in the invention of the oldest letters which represent gods. The most important of these symbols was the Onk which without the loop becomes the Egyptian Taut, the same as the Greek Taue, a simple T. A symbol on which the deity of Jesus would be crucified. The Druids of northern Europe venerated the tree and the snake by scrawling the Taue cross into tree bark. Amongst the modern Freemasons the means a key to treasure or a place where the precious thing is concealed. That precious thing is the secret knowledge of eternal life, the secret of the serpent bloodline. This symbol became the mark or sign which would set the believer aside for saving when the gods returned. In Ezekiel this is the mark that god will know, the mark on the forehead. The aliens gave a secret symbol for their own kind. This remarkable idea of wearing the Taue cross on the shoulder as a sign would later become part and parcel of the crusader templars markings. The very same templars who are instigated in the worship of serpents. Anybody who knows about the Da Vinci Code will know about the Templar linked family of Christ, the Merovingians. They were said to be descended from Jesus and a serpent fish deity, and again bear a red cross on their shoulder blades. We shall return to the Merovingians soon to unlock the key to the aliens that walk among us today. There are other signs and symbols scattered around the world that reveal the ancient aliens. If we move into the lands of the celts we discover more symbolism. Beautiful Celtic knot work is derived from the images of the snake and the movements of the planets. It is a merging of the beings from the heavens and the heavens themselves. We can see influences of this in the spirals and other serpent shapes not just in Celtic history but also upon many of the world's ancient monuments. In Scandinavian literature and stone art we can also see how the serpent appears looking remarkably like Celtic knot work. In Roman and Greek wall paintings there are running spirals thought to be symbolic of the protective snake. Spirals and carvings of the serpent are see all over the world. And it is always found to be in association with a serpent worship in strange and bizarre looking alien like creatures. It is no surprise that such images of the snake in all its relative forms should be seen on the most ancient of rock art. In the cup and ring marks there are many images of what appears to be a serpent entering the cup and rings. Some have put this down to a serpent entering a hole. Others that it is eating an egg. Nobody is sure. Maybe it reveals a kind of wormhole travel. Thoth was said to be the originator of serpent worship in Phoenicia. He is called a god and he invented hieroglyphs. Toth consecrated the species of dragons and serpents and the Phoenicians and Egyptians followed him in the superstition. This Thoth is a memory of the first group who settled here on earth and instigated the worship of the serpent after the flood or end of the last ice age 12,000 years ago. Thoth was deified after his death. A time that nobody knows. And given the title the god of health or healing. He was the prototype for Asclepius and identified with Hermes and Mercury. All healers, all wise, all teachers, all saviors and all associated with the serpent for their powers and all individuals who could map the stars and movements of time. All with the full super power attributed again and again to the ancient aliens. This Thoth is the archetypical alien invader. The memory of the host that came down from the sky and taught mankind. The symbol of them all is the Tau cross, the mark of Cain. The symbol of the ancient alien invaders. The symbol our fabled gods have been sacrificed upon. If you wish to hide a secret hide it in plain sight. And that is precisely what they did. For thousands of years this symbol has become a sign of the ultimate secret, the ultimate truth of the origin of human civilization. It has been kept alive by one particular group. The guardians of the secret of the alien bloodline. It all began in Mesopotamia and is alive and well to this day in the bloodline of the royalty of the world. We have seen the history and mythology of the alien serpent past. We have seen the serpentine saviors rise and fall across the world. Today there is one particular savior myth that has crept into popular folklore through various best selling books, documentaries and films. The Merovingian dynasty. The Merovingian dynasty has been romantically depicted both by the regional writers in France and international best selling authors such as Dan Brown. There are tales of mystery and magic, of wisdom and light, and last but not least of all desent from what we now call God via his son Jesus and his supposed wife Mary Magdalene. The Merovingians were descended from an ultra ancient race of fallen angels that spawned the globe taking wisdom and knowledge with them as the idea of Atlantis sank. It all started with a leader of the Salian Franks known as the Moravek in the fifth century AD. Both he and his son Childrek were great warriors and fought with super human strength against the Visigoths, Saxons and Eliminate. Following Childrek came his son Clovis the First who went on to unite most of Gaul and the Lewar and defeated the Roman rule Syagrius. It was Clovis the First who adopted the Roman Catholic religion for his nation. Eventually by the early seventh century we end up with the infamous Dagobert the SEcond. Also known as Dragobert coming from the words dragon and burt which in turn come from bara or para which means pharo. So Dragobert simply means king or pharaoh of the dragons. He is the culmination of the serpent holy and royal bloodline. Dagobert is said to have visited the serpent worshiping brethren in Ireland. Still today Masons worship the head or skull of Dragaburt calling it Mahamet. It is kept in the Covenant of the Black Sisters at Maude's. The cup that was formed to hold the skull was made into the shape of a chalise. Hence we have the head of the dragon pharo in the chalise. A new version of the cup of the Agatha Damon, the good serpent. But who is Dagobert? And where did he come from? What makes him so important that his skull should be turned into a grail and then worshipped by the Masons? The modern Templars. Dagobert the Second was a French king from the supposed grail Merovingian bloodline. And it was the last of the Merovingian kings to hold the title of Holy Roman Emperor. These Merovingians are said to be a dynasty of Francis priest kings with magical powers. Derived from their long red hair and the special birthmark between their shoulders of a red cross. Obviously the Christians spread rumors of witchcraft and various other misdemeanors because Dagobert was seen as a threat. After several years spent away from his Frankish kingdom Dagobert returned from Ireland in 679. Trouble set in and it ended with the death of Dagobert and the rise of a new royal bloodline. (celestial music0 The Catholics had wiped out the troublesome Merovingians once and for all. Or did they? The truth is that the Merovingian bloodline was already deeply rooted in the bloodline of the royalty in Europe and it could not be erased. The ancient alien blood coursed through their veins and they remain to this day the most powerful families on the planet. The Merovingians connected etymologically with the snake as well as ritualistically where simply descendants of the serpent bloodline the royal line descended from serpent alien invaders who spread out across the globe in India and China and Britain and America. The original and most fabled Moravek is named after the sacred bull of the ancient Greeks, Miro. The ultimate secret held sacred by the Greeks was this. The bull has begotten a serpent and the serpent a bull. The two are interchangeable. The bull is symbolized by the Taue cross and so too is the serpent. It was this King Moravek, the first in the line of Merovingian kings who was said to have been spawned by the great seabull Kinator. This is a giant sea monster with a bull head. The Mir part of the Mirovi becomes obvious in that Mir means sea. He is the king bull of the sea, the sun in Taurus which gives us a special place in time. The time of the original ancient alien invasion. This bull king goes back a very long way in history. Right back to the days of Mesopotamia and kings such as Sargon and Miness. But this goes back yet further to when association between these kings and their legendary genesis from ancient sea born gods such as Oatis and Degod who were serpent gods or aliens. These myths are those of invading serpent aliens and migrating snake cults coming into the land bringing with them all the skills associated with the coming of these ancient gods. Such as metallurgy, architecture and medicine. These are the same as the biblical Leviathan, the great serpent of ages past who encircled the world as the Oroborus, the symbol of immortality and eternity of control over the globe. This is the same symbol which detracts the phrase my end is my beginning. Like the words placed into the mouth of Christ I am the beginning and the end, the Alpha and Omega. In fact, the Christians of later times went on to use the image of the Oroborus as a symbol for the Alpha and Omega elements of their Christian faith. The Levites of course derived their name from this Leviathan. Their name meaning Sons of the Leviathan. They were the sons of the serpent rulers of ancient times. According to Babylonian legend in the beginning there was neither land, gods, nor men. There were only aliens known as Tiamat and Absu. Tiamat was the female and the spirit of salt water and primal chaos. And Absu the male, the spirit of freshwater and void. Tiamat is depicted with scales and a serpentine body and legs with horns on her head. The union of these two gods produced all the other gods including the greatest among them, Kinagi. This later became the Kinator, the progenitor of the Miricinians. Their bloodline stretched back to the end of the age of Taurus. This for the first time gives us actual dates for the ancient alien invasion and amazingly it fits perfectly with all that we have discovered in their origin in the dawn of Mesopotamian civilization. 5,000 to 4,000 BC. Over thousands of years and across hundreds of cultures, the history of this ancient invasion by the great shining ones from the heavens altered and became legend and myth. Much of it turned into the great religions of the planet. But hidden in these stories is the real literal truth about an invasion of planet earth by beings so strange that we called them serpents. Ancient man left cave paintings and tales of their coming across the world. The great guardians of the shining ones known as The Watchers, mated with human females and a hybrid bloodline was born. It became the bloodline of the rulers of our globe and was protected and kept secret. Every now and then the secret would emerge into popular mythology with people such as the Merovingians and tales of superhuman powers. Up until around 5,000 BC we know that mankind has no great civilizations. It had been this way for millennia. Then suddenly at the very time we know as the age of Taurus and the very period that the remaining texts tell us the shining ones came and taught humanity it all changed. Suddenly civilization erupted. The Sumerians migrated to Mesopotamia towards something that seemed to attract them. This is the period of tales of a great cataclysm. What we know as the flood. Judgment from above. The gods were angry and dealt humanity a cruel blow. These tales are worldwide. Civilization erupted and great learning spread far and wide. The all powerful symbol of the Swastika emerged which is in reality four serpents overlapping. Serpent rock art appears all over the world. A great and powerful image of a horned god now begins to find itself everywhere. This is the Lord of the Animals, the image of the one who had all knowledge. In the Bible he would become the one we know as Moses, the wielder of the serpent staff, the teacher of his people. The one who would raise up the brazen serpent in the wilderness to protect his special people from other serpents. This is the period that Enoch tells us was the time of war between those who had come down from the sky, the angels, the nephila, the shining ones. These were the great shining serpents who had magical flaming swords and wheel like or disc like ships that flew around the sky. As the scribe of the shining ones Enoch himself was shielded from death and taken away by the aliens to live out his days in Heaven. Christians today know him as the man who walked with God. And the reason is simple. God came down to earth and walked on our soil. Spoke with Enoch and then returned. Whatever this means it does reveal that ancient man witnessed something remarkable. In truth this was the period of the ancient invasion of planet earth by the shining race of serpents who came from the sky. Our ancestors worshiped them for their amazing power and yet in our modern scientific age we can now see things more clearly. These were not angels or messengers of light. These were not great Greek deities sat on high and issuing commands. They were not the many faced Hindu or Egyptian gods. These were beings from another planet who came here with superior technology. They helped mankind start civilization. They bred with us and they fought with each other. Most we are told left. But the hybrid race remained among us as special people. And now with every passing day NASA tells us they have discovered another earth like planet that could sustain life. They find ancient rivers and lakes on Mars and even fatty acids within the Martian soil. They alter their equations on the existence of alien life on a weekly basis. Even they are growing more and more aware that soon they will discover something special. The question is will we awaken the ancient invaders and will they return if they're not already here. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
