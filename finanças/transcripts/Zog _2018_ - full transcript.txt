R-r-r-ar! HE GIGGLES Argh! Ha! Rah! Eurgh! DRAGONS LAUGH METAL CLANGS NARRATOR: Madam Dragon ran a school, many moons ago. She taught young dragons all the things that dragons need to know. Zog, the biggest dragon, was the keenest one by far. He tried his hardest every day to win a golden star. Ah? ZOG GROANS All the dragons in Year One were learning how to fly. Argh! Ha-ha-ha! High! High! Way up in the sky! Ha-ha-ha... GRAVEL PATTERS Huh? Oh! A-a-a-a-a-rgh! SHE GASPS Oh! Ooh! Ha-ha... Ah... Ha-ha-ha! A-ha-ha! Hmmm... Hmmm... Ah! Aw... Ha-ha! Ooh... Ah-ha! Now that you've been shown, you can practise on your own... Oh! THEY GIGGLE EXCITEDLY ... and you'll all be expert fliers by the time you're fully grown. Zog went off to practise, flying fast and free. He soared and swooped and looped the loop... ... then crashed into a tree. Pearl! Hm! Pearl? IN DISTANCE: Pearl? DISTANT SOBS Pearl? ZOG SOBS Just then, a little girl came by. Oh... Please don't cry. ... she said. Perhaps you'd like a... ... ooh, a nice sticky plaster for your head? RIP! Uh! What a good idea! ... said Zog... SHE GIGGLES ... then up and off he flew, his plaster gleaming pinkly as he zigzagged through the blue. R-r-a-a-a! A year went by, and in Year Two the dragons learned to roar. R-r-a-a-r! R-r-a-a-r! Oh. More! More! Louder, I implore! R-r-a-a-r... Roar! Ahem! R-R-A-A-A-A-A-R! R-r-a-a-a-r! Ooh... R-a-a-a-r! R-a-a-a-a-r! FROG CROAKS Ahem... R-r-r-a-a-a! R-R-R-A-A-A-A-R! Yay! Woohoo! Now that you've been shown, you can practise on your own - and you'll all be champion roarers by the time you're fully grown. R-r-r-a-a! R-a-a-a! Zog went off to practise. R-r-r-a-a! R-r-r-a-ar! R-r-r-a-a! R-r-r-a-a! G-r-r-r... HE BREATHES DEEPLY R-R-R-A-A-A-A-R! He roared with fearsome force! HE ROARS FIERCELY He kept it up for hours on end... Ooh! HE COUGHS HOARSELY ... but then his throat grew hoarse. MEN SHOUT MEN SHOUT Pssst, hey! Whaaa! Just then, the girl came by again. Ah, ha-ha... HE COUGHS Oh, dear... What rotten luck. Perhaps you'd like a nice soothing peppermint to suck? What a good idea! ... said Zog. HE ROARS FIERCELY R-r-r-a-r! SHE GIGGLES Oh! Then up and off he flew, and breathing fumes of peppermint, he zigzagged through the blue. A year went by, and in Year Three the dragons learned to blow. No, no. Breathe out fire, not snow! THEY LAUGH Ahem. HE SIGHS Ah! Now that you've been shown, you can practise on your own. You will all be breathing bonfires by the time you're fully grown. Hmmm. Yeah... Zog went off to practise. He blew with all his might. He twirled around in triumph... A-ha-ha! ... and his wing tip caught alight. CLOCK TICKS PEARL HUMS SOFTLY Oh... Hmmm... CLATTERING SHE SIGHS DISTANT SCREAM SPLASH! Urgh! Ooh... Ah... Just then, the girl came by again. What... ? Shhh... Oh, dear. You poor old thing! Hmm. Perhaps you'd like a nice stretchy bandage for your wing? Hmm... Agh... Ooh! What a good idea. ... said Zog. A-ha, ha-ha! Then up and off he flew, his bandage flapping wildly, as he zigzagged through the blue. All the Year Four dragons were learning... Can you guess? Yes? Yes? How to capture a princess. HE CHUCKLES Ugh! Ha, ha! Aah! Ho-ho-ho! Yow! Whoo! Ha-ha-ha! MADAM DRAGON SIGHS Now that you've been shown, you can practise on your own. You'll need to capture hundreds by the time you're fully grown. Zog went off to practise. Argh! He tried... ... and tried... ... and tried... ... but he simply couldn't manage. Argh! Urgh! Oh! Ow! I'm no good at this! ... he cried. KNOCKING Pearl. Pearl! Pearl! I'm no good at this. Oh! SMASH! Oh... WATER TRICKLES Hmm... HOLLOW KNOCKING Pearl! Ah! Argh! Oi! MEN SHOUT HE SOBS QUIETLY I'll never win a golden star. Just then, he saw the girl. Perhaps... you'd like to capture me? My name is Princess Pearl. Oh! What a good idea. ... said Zog. MAN: Dragon! There he is! Get him... Then up and off they flew... ... the princess gripping tightly, as they zigzagged through the blue. Ha-ha-ha! Woohoo! MADAM DRAGON: Hmmm... PIG OINKS Ah... Ah! Our first princess so far! Congratulations, Zog, my dear. You've won a golden star! THEY CHEER Zog was proud and happy, and Pearl felt good, as well. Urgh! CRACK! She took the dragons' temperatures... ... and nursed them when they fell. Aaah! Aaah! Oh... Ah-ah-ah... choo! SQUEAKING A year went by and in Year Five the dragons learned to fight. THEY GROAN Woohoo! Whoo, whoo, whoo! HORSE NEIGHS Right. Right! Here comes a real live knight! METAL CLANKS Ugh... HE GROANS Good day! My name is Gadabout - Sir Gadabout the Great! SQUEAK! I've come to... ... hmm... ... hrr... rescue Princess Pearl. I hope I'm not too late. Zog breathed fire and beat his wings. You can't! She's mine! ... he roared. HE ROARS FIERCELY Oh, no, she's not! ... yelled Gadabout, and waved his trusty sword. Ha-ha! ZOG GROWLS The other dragons crowded round and watched them, all agog. Who was going to win the fight, Sir Gadabout or Zog? Ooh! Argh... Argh! DISTANT SHOUTS Hm? Ha! Yargh! A-a-a-a-a-rgh! Woohoo! Ha-ha-ha! Then Princess Pearl stepped forward, crying... Stop! Argh! You silly chumps. The world's already far too full of cuts and burns and bumps. Aha... Er... Don't rescue me. I won't go back to being a princess, and prancing round the palace in a silly, frilly dress! I want to be a doctor, and travel here and there, listening to people's chests and giving them my care. SQUEAKING Hmm... HE CHUCKLES Me... too! ... exclaimed the knight, and took his helmet off his head. I'd rather wear a nice twisty stethoscope instead. Ha-ha. Perhaps, Princess, you'll train me up? And Pearl replied... Hmmm... er... ... of course. Hmmm... ... but I don't see how the two of us could fit upon your horse. Flying doctors. Oooh. I'd love to join the crew! If you'll let me be your ambulance, then I can carry you! Bravo! A Dragon Ambulance, an excellent career! And all the Year Five dragons gave a loud resounding cheer. ALL CHEER HE HUMS A TUNE But what about my trusty steed? Ah! HORSE GULPS I really hope you'll stay. I'll let you be my pupils' pet, and feed you lots of hay. What a good idea! ... said Zog. Whoa! Ha-ha-ha! Then up and off they flew... Woohoo! Ye-o-o-o-o-w! ... the Flying Doctors waving, as they zigzagged through the blue.
