[tense music playing] [energetic music playing] [Hannah panting] [gasps] [pirate kids yelling] Soda bombs away! [gasps] [grunts] That all you got? [chuckles mischievously] Release the Kraken Kid. [snarls] Nope! [thrilling music playing] [Hannah panting] [chuckles] What's crackin'? [grunts] [grunts] [water bubbling] [gasps, breathes heavily] Phew! [Scoffs] - [distant rumbling] - [gasps] [water splashing] She got away. The captain is not going to like this. [suspenseful music playing] [mysterious music playing] Lower the sails. We'll find it. [spirited music playing] [Hannah breathing heavily] [exhales] Still dry. [dramatic music playing] [over video recording] Craig, we're gonna miss you a lot. Table four isn't gonna be the same without you. Yeah, table four for life! [softly] Hey, say goodbye to Craig. Oh. Hey, man. Shame you won't be around in lunch anymore. And it's definitely a shame you're gonna miss my big birthday sleepover! [chuckles] My dad gave me, like, a $1,200 budget. It's nuts. Anyway, not gonna be the same without you, Greg. [James] Dude, his name is Craig, not Greg. - [Bryan] Who? - [tablet beeps] [wistful music playing] [Jessica] Bernard, look! [Bernard snores, grunts] - Huh? What? - Is that our new house? Uh, that's a silo. Small Uncle, look! Is that our new house? - Tree. - Is that our new house? - Man on a bike. - [bicycle bell ringing] - [bicyclist] Hello. - Is that our new house? Pasta La Vista. Wait, they got a Pasta La Vista here? [Jessica huffing] Oh, for real? - [bicycle bell ringing] - [bicyclist] Hey, watch the road. - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. - [tires screeching] Well, I think you all are going to love it here. It's a beautiful town. And our new house has enough space for all of you to get your own rooms. Finally. Tired of sleeping in a bunk underneath this stink factory. You just gonna take that, Craiggy? [sighs] Next Saturday is Bryan Banks' birthday. And he's having a sleepover. If we were still home, I would be going to my first real sleepover ever. I'm sorry, sweetie. But they have sleepovers in Maryland too. I'm sure as soon as the kids here meet you, you are going to be getting sleepover invitations left and right. But how am I even supposed to meet anyone? It's summer. There are other ways to meet kids. You just gotta look around. See what's out there. [melancholic music playing] [sighs] [lively music playing] Here we are. Wow! Can you believe it, Small Uncle? [clicking] I thought they were gonna fix this. Well, now we gonna fix it. As soon as we look up how to fix a light switch. [somber music playing] All right. Finally some space for a grill. We could have some serious cookouts here. [sighs] [sighs] I know, my guy. We left a lot behind. [Nicole] Who wants to pick rooms? - [Jessica and Bernard] Me! - Ooh, ooh. Me, me, me! Honey, pick the room with the bathroom! [mysterious music playing] [shudders] [crickets chirping] [rattling] What is that? [loud clanking] [yelps] - [yelps] - [Bernard] What? [yelps] Craig, what are you doing? There's a monster in my vent. Are you for real? [Duane] What? What is going on in here? Craig's being a big scaredy-cat. I am not. Daddy, Small Uncle needs you to tuck him in again. Okay, I got it. You okay, Craig? I'm fine. Good night. [door slams] [Gibson] Wait, you like food? I like food. You do? Oh, man. We have so much in common. You wanna get some food with me right now? Yeah, I do. All right, food-getting boys. [Bernard] Making friends is so easy. - [knock on door] - [Nicole] Craig. [gasps, pants] You in here, sweetie? I thought maybe we could work on unpacking your room today. [Craig] Never. Okay. How about the box with your clothes in it. I like what I'm wearing. - [gentle music playing] - [Nicole sighs] Listen, Craig. I know this move has been hard, but your father and I just want to provide the best we can for you kids, and sometimes that means making hard decisions. [Craig grumbles] [Craig] I was happy where we were. I was starting to make friends. I was going to Bryan Banks' big birthday sleepover. But now, I'm here. This room with an air vent that sounds like it's got a bird trapped in it. [sighs] I know this place feels different. But it's never gonna feel like home if you don't give it a chance. Look around. There's so much possibility here. Well? If you don't wanna unpack, can you at least get some fresh air? Your sister wants to check out the playground up the street. Think you can take her? How about if I let you pick the toppings for tonight's pizza dinner? - [box clatters on floor] - I'll do it for pizza. We're here. So, what do you wanna do first? Small Uncle does not want to do the slides. Okay, what does Small Uncle wanna do? Hm. [mimics static] Welcome to Craig-copter Airlines. Today, we'll be flying approximately one million miles in the air. Two million. [Craig] Two million miles in the air. A hundred million. [Craig] A hundred million miles into space. Please keep all hands and feet inside the swing, as we prepare for blastoff! [Jessica yelling] Ahh! Small Uncle! [Jessica groaning] Small Uncle, where are you? I'm sorry, Jessica. He went in there. [spooky music playing] [crying] No! Small Uncle. [sniffling] He... was... my... only friend here, and now I have... nobody. [crying] Yeesh! I thought you were excited to move here. Because I had Small Uncle. - [sobbing] - Hey, hey, hey. It's all right. Just breathe. [both breathing deeply] - I'll go get him for you. - Okay. Wait here. I'll be right back. How far could he have gone? [classic Western music playing] [crickets chirping] [yelps] [shudders] Whoa! [pleasant music playing] Huh? [chuckles] - [croaking] - Whoa! A frog. [croaks] - [Craig yelps] - You've encountered the Frog Master. Ha! You're no match for the Bug Battler. I choose you, Stinkbug! Stinkbug, use... Ha! Your insect type is no match for my frog type. [frog burps] - Oh! - [yells] There's definitely more where that came from. [yells] - [distant whooshing] - Huh? [yells] [Water balloon Mike] Bombs away! Good grief! A civilian? This is water balloon war! You better watch out. You are liable to get yourself soaked. Come on, soldiers! Let's H-2-go! - [kids] Yeah! - Go, go, go. [bicycle bell ringing] - Watch out! - [Craig shrieks] [Handlebarb yells] Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that. - [Todd] Bleh! - [Handlebarb] Oh, it's chill. He just took a little spill. Huh? [chuckles] Come on, little bro. Time to roll. Are... are you okay? Oh, yeah. I'm totally good. - I always like to start my day with a sick crash. - [heavy metal music playing] Mm, that's my good one. Will you grab that? Oh, um... [chuckles nervously] Yeah, here you go. [tooth pops in] Hey, have you guys seen a Small Uncle toy around here? He's about this big, and, um, kind of looks like an... an onion? I... I honestly don't know what he's supposed to be. If you're looking for a toy, I'd check the trading tree. The Trading Tree? What's that? Yo, are you new to the Creek? The Creek? Hop on. [upbeat music playing] Hold on tight. - Okay! - [tires screeching] [Craig chuckles] [grunting] And... we're here. Where? [Cannonball] Welcome to the Trading Tree. Whoa! This is where all of the kids in the creek come to trade and snack. And if anyone found that little onion you're looking for, - probably made its way here. - [Warpspeed yelling] Come on, before they run out of Yogo. [Todd] Yogo! Maybe I'll see you around, man. Whoa! So many kids here. [Grunts] [Horse Girls neighing] Quick, fellow scouts! Can you identify that friend group? The Horse Girls? That's right, Jason. [bubbling] And we add two parts carbonation with one part fruity binding agent. [yelps] [goop plops] Will you science kids watch it? Some of us are trying to have a tea party! [Kit] All right, all right. Who's ready to trade? This is a trading tree. Not the standing-around- and-looking-tree. You wanna trade that for Spicy Beefers? Now that's more like it. Come on, step right up and trade. We got fun-size, king-size. [coughs] Half-eaten, but half price. Come on, who's next? Hey, Kit, what can I trade for this? [gasps] Small Uncle. Wait, wait, wait, wait. That's mine. Uh, you must be new here, because that is not how this works. At the Trading Tree, we trade. Okay, new kid? - [mysterious music playing] - [Craig] I'm sorry, but I think that belongs to my sister. Well, here we go. Everybody got a sister. Look, you got proof of ownership, new kid? [scoffs] Check the tag. - [chuckles] - [loud boom] [cup clatters] [Eliza gasps] - [booming continues] - [Horse Girls neighing] What? Where's everyone going? [Kit] Here, just take it. Oh, not again. This is the fifth raid this week! Wait, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What's going on? - What's happening? - [horn blowing] [inhales deeply] Pirates! [rustling] [intimidating music playing] [children yelling] - Ka... - Boom! [boy 1 yelling] [heavy metal music playing] [Bobby yelps] [knife thwacks] - My candy! - Jackpot. [Laughs] - [Kraken Kid growling] - [glass clattering] [both yelling, panting] - [both scream] - [Kraken Kid laughs] [Teach grunts] No, please. These sodas are untested. [groans] This is the worst day of my life. - [children grunting] - [Craig panting] [yelps] Huh? No! Ugh! Hey, that's my sister's. [both gasp] [both] Huh? [Wren gasps] [tense music playing] [laughing evilly] You must be new here, because if you knew who I was, you wouldn't have done that. Huh? [Groans] I'll show you who runs this creek. - [grunting] - [Mortimor screeching] What? [Groans] [yelping] - [Mortimor screeching] - [grunting angrily] After them! - [Craig grunting] - [splashing] [groans] [squawks] You saved me. [squawks] Hey, there they are. [gasps] [Kelsey yelling] [Andy groans] [Kelsey grunts] Ow! Me shin, arr! - Whoa! - Run! [both panting] [crying] Oh, sweetie. It's okay. [dramatic music playing] Craig, I just asked you to take her to the playground, not dropkick her doll into the woods. I didn't kick anything? It was the... And what happened to your clothes? Oh, my gosh, Mom. - There were these pirates... - [Nicole] Pirates? They're gonna make him walk the plank. Small Uncle can't do that. He doesn't have legs. [Crying] We will talk later. [chuckles] Thank you for helping my son. It was nice to meet you... Kelsey. Kelsey. Normally, we'd invite you in, - but our house is... - [electricity crackling] [Duane] Whoo! My belt buckle is melting. Under construction. Coming, Duane. [sighs] Well, thanks for saving me back... - Pay up. - Huh? Pay up. - For what? - For saving you. You think I did that for free? Well, you didn't exactly give me a choice. Would you rather be paying up, or cut in twain? Uh, is there a third option? I don't stick my neck out 'cause I'm nice. I do it for snacks. So pay up. [Craig] Fine. [Kelsey munching] I wanna go back home. [rattling, whirring] [grumbles] Again? [grunting in frustration] Just great. [Grunts softly] - This place. [Shudders] - [vent rattling] [grunts] What? [reading] "To whoever finds this diary... If you are reading this, I've already moved. My name" [Hannah] "is Hannah. And this was my search for the greatest power "known to kid kind." - "The Wishmaker." - [Hannah] "The Wishmaker. To learn more, turn to page 12." I said, page 12. Hey, this is still my diary, you know. Oh, no, no. [Hannah] Thank you. Now, The Wishmaker... [reading] "This magical relic was created thousands of years ago" by the children of middle school. Folded in the fires of second period math, The Wishmaker had the power to grant any wish a kid desired. But accessing this sorcery is not so simple. The Wishmaker's power is sealed "behind a puzzle of arcane runes." [voice 1] Red. R-E-D. [voice 2] Five. [Hannah] "Activate the runes in the correct order..." - [voice 1] Four. - [Hannah] "And your wish will be granted. Some wished for strength. Some wished for beauty. Some wished to simply never have to go to bed. But like most good things, somebody totally ruined it. Our ancient kid-cestors decided to hide The Wishmaker, to save kid kind from total destruction. "Where they hid it, no kid can remember." [Craig and Hannah] "My time at the Creek has ended." [Craig] "But this diary contains all that I have learned in my explorations. Perhaps, whoever finds this can make their wish come true." [gasps] That's it. That's how I can get out of this stink town. Find The Wishmaker and wish my family back to our real home. All I gotta do is go back to the creek. [grunts] Not getting yelled at for grass stains again. [rock music playing] Hoodie armor! Level nine. [sniffs] Extra stink barrier. For protection... Hm. Hm? - [drill whirring] - [grunting] Oh! Hm. A staff from the banister I got my head stuck in at granddad's house. [grunting] Perfect. Okay, now, to carry stuff... Nah, kind of feels like I'm going to school. Hm. Introducing the Purse of Holding. [mimics drums beats] A purse fit for an adventure. Power-ups. I'm sorry, Small Onion. It's just not the same. Time to make a wish. [Nicole] Craig! You're going out. Uh, I'm just going to the Creek for a little bit, to, uh, try and find Small Uncle. So don't unpack any of my stuff while I'm gone. You sure? Not even some clean underwear? Especially not my clean underwear. Okay, but come home if this weather turns, all right? Looks like we might be in for some rain. Right, better be off then. [mysterious music playing] [breathes deeply] [mellow music playing] [Craig grunting] [yelping] Ugh! Stupid pirates. [wind howling] Here. Hey! You're that new kid who was looking for the Small Uncle, right? Uh, yeah. My name is Craig. Kit. I never forget a trade, especially if I have to give it back. [chuckles] Well, if it makes you feel any better, I lost her toy again. - Those pirates took it. - [thuds] It does make me feel better. [sighs] The Creek wasn't always like this. Kids didn't play pirate before she showed up. Wait, who? Serena, Captain of the Pirate Kids. Nobody knows where she came from. She just showed up in the creek one day, with a bad attitude and a sword. She bullied, she bossed, and she took whatever she wanted. Some kids joined up with Serena for the spoils. Some joined out of fear. But ever since she hoisted her flag, these waters have not been safe. Oh, not the shrimp sticks too. You know how hard it was to get these? I had to trade through three school systems. Ugh! [sighs] With business like this, I don't know how much longer I can keep playing at the Creek. Hey, have you seen that kid with the cape and the bird in her overalls. The sunflower seed kid? Uh, yeah, yeah, Kelsey. Check the oak tree around the bend. Thanks. And watch yourself out there. [twig snaps] [spits] [grunts, yells] [screams, sighs] It's you again. No trade backs, new kid. I'm not here to get my snacks back. I need your help. [Kelsey grunting] What, you have trouble with your shoelaces or something? No... no. I'm... I'm on a quest. [Kelsey] Huh? I'm looking for The Wishmaker. [laughing maniacally] Hey, you're funny. I don't like funny people. What's so funny? The Wishmaker's a suburban legend, a Creek myth, like Creekfoot, or the Boogerman, the man that steals boogers? It's not real. [grumbles] Oh, yeah? Then that's this? A drawing of a unicorn with a jet pack? Huh? Oh, uh... This. [gasps] [Kelsey] Kelsey gasped, awestruck by the awesome sight. She was typically more eloquent with her awestruck responses, but this map had left her awestruck. It was an actual, real-life treasure map. Could this fool be telling the truth? [birds chirping] Uh, hello? Chelsea? It's Kelsey, and where did you get that? Doesn't matter. The point is, I'm gonna find The Wishmaker, and I'm gonna need some protection from the pirate Serena and her crew. Will you join me? What's in it for me? A wish. [spits] All right. [grunts] But I'm gonna need some payment up-front too. [grumbles] Here. - Choco-roll. - [Mortimor squawks] One for Mortimor too. We're a package deal. [scoffs] Birds can't eat choco-rolls. It's the principle of the thing. [Craig grumbles] Okay, so let's go over some ground rules. One, I gotta be home by dinner. Two, things could get bloody. So, if you're squeamish, get good at closing your eyes. [shudders] And three, we're gonna need some transportation. Here you go. [grunts] One raft. [Mortimor squawks] This is a baby pool. Will it even float? Hey, supplies are tight with these pirates around. Now, are you trading or what? He'll also take some of those sunflower seeds. - [Mortimor squawks] - [Craig grumbles] Okay. This diary only has half of a map. But this kid, Hannah, has tons of notes. So I think with these I can figure out the rest. I mean, I am pretty good with maps if I do say so myself. Do you have to eat that in front of me? Mm. Yeah, I do. [munching loudly] All right, let's just get movin'. [baby pool inflates] [Craig blowing air, coughing] A little help, please.

We are the Wind in the Woods. The Priests of Plants. And none shall pass. Unless, you answer a riddle. How many times do we have to tell you. We don't do riddles. We're elves, not trolls. Ugh! Well, we're just paddling through, so... Too many children have desecrated our forest. So we swore to protect the plants that cannot protect themselves. With riddles! Do you have an offering? Uh, no. [giggles] Oh. Well, then. None shall pass! What? [Grunts] Open the gate. Wait. We'll do the riddle. - [gasps] "I must sink to rise." - Oh, gosh. - "I must drown to live." - No. - "Once I'm grown..." - Oh, boy. [Roger] "...I do nothing but give." - [Jameolas] Okay. - "What am I?" That's it. I'm taking the book. - Give it. - [Roger grunting] "I sink to rise, I drown to live"? Hm. Yeah, that riddle's tough. Almost as tough as that Mithril soccer net of theirs. Well, I think we've got a better chance with battle. [munching] It's three on one, but I'm pretty sure I can take 'em. Wait, I got it. - [Roger] No, give it back... - [Jameolas grunting] [Craig] "I must sink to rise, I must drown to live, and once I'm grown, I do nothing but give." I'm a seed. - [Roger] Whoa! - [Jameolas] Seeds. - To replenish the forest. - You may pass. [victorious music playing] [coughing] Roger. Ugh, I think I swallowed a ring... worm. [Kelsey] Look alive. There's a fork ahead. [Craig] Hm. It looks like the Creek bends around this way, but I'm missing the other half of the map. Not sure which way to go. Mortimor, scout up ahead. One chirp for piranhas, two chirps for pirates. And if you see piranha pirates, safe yourself. Hiyah! How did you train him to do that? Mortimor and I spend a lot of time together at the Creek honing our fighting skills. I may look like a regular second grader, but I have more battle scabs than most kids will pick in a lifetime. My parents never let me have a pet. They just told me to play with my brother and sister. I have no brethren nor sistren, or any sibl-ren at all. I'm the only child of my bloodline. And my dad, the only parent. But Mortimor is like a brother to me. My dad got him for me when I was five. I read this book about a prince with a falcon that could peck out the eyes of his enemies. So I asked for a falcon for Hanukkah, but my dad said that was too dangerous, and that we had enough medical bills as is. So, he got a parakeet. But parakeets are tough. Don't underestimate them. We both may look small, but we fight at a 12th grade level. And I can read at a nineth grade level. - [Mortimor chirps] - What is it, Mortimor? [chirping] Wait, what was six chirps for? Giant squid? Hydra? - Parents? - Whoa! Huh? Pirates! [Kelsey] Paddle. No, the other way. The other way. But I am going the other way. - [Kelsey] The other, other way. - [Craig yelps] This is gonna cost you extra. Okay, I'll pay whatever you want. [Kelsey grunting] [groans] Ugh, I thought you were a warrior. [Norman chuckles] Never turn your back on a pirate. [yells] [Craig] Uh... [Norman] Whoa! [Kelsey grunting] - [water splashing] - You all right? [boat stretching] [shouting hoarsely] [both screaming] Gotcha! - [Craig whimpers] - [both] Huh? [both grunting] [Renee laughing] We got some booty. [pirate kids laughing] - Ha! - Ha! [chuckles] You've got booties all right. Some booties that I'm gonna kick! [yells, gasps] Stop it! I'm trying to threaten you. Hey! [Panting] Give it back! [monkey geckering] [pirate kids laughing] [Craig gasps] [Cammy laughing] [squelching] Okay, you got our snacks. Can you let us go now? Not so fast. What were you doing in pirate waters? I got nothing to say. [scoffs] Me neither. Then we will talk to the bird. Ha! Mortimor ain't no stool pigeon either. [chirps] Nuh-uh. Better luck with your next hostages, losers. Oh, we'll get all three of you to talk. [pirate kids laughing] Shall we escort them to the captain? No, nothing till we know their je ne sais quoi. Uh... what? What they're up to? Oh, mm-hm. Take them to The Torturer! [laughing evilly] [Craig and Kelsey gulp] [both groaning] [laughing] Y'all are in for it now. Have fun. [both laughing] [Kelsey grunts] Come on, Mortimor. [grunting] [Mortimor chirping] [chewing gum popping] [inflates, pop] Yo, ho, ho. And a packet of gum. Who are you? They call me "The Torturer." JP, The Torturer. And I'm here to break your souls using any means necessary. And today, I think I'll start with my favorite. How would you like a dose of an uncomfortable amount of eye contact! [Grunting] Yeah, I mean I've had worse. Yeah, it looks like it's hurting you more than us. Fine. [grunts] Not... not awkward enough for ya, eh? Guess you city slickers have seen eyes before. Good for you. Then how about something a little nastier? Perhaps the Goggles of Inferno, Sir Spikes-A-Lot, maybe the Bucket of Doom! Huh? Huh? No, for you I think I'll use a wet willy. You wanna stick that in my ear? [chuckles] Your funeral, pal. Ugh. Well, what about you? Well, I definitely don't want that in my ear, but it seems like you don't want it there either. Oh, I'm not convincing enough for ya, am I? So, you're the torture expert now? I mean, is your name... What is your name? Craig. Oh, nice to meet you, Craig. Is your name Craig The Torturer? No, I'm not Craig the anything. Okay, Not-Craig-The-Anything. If you know so much about being a scary pirate, how about you just show me how to do it, huh? Well, I didn't say I was an expert, but... - Yar! Har! Har! - [screams] [yelping] Spikes! Whoa, whoa! - [sizzling] - Fire! I'm surrounded by spikes and fire. [Grunts] [groaning] Oh, no. Are you okay? Yeah. [Sniffles] No. I'm a terrible pirate. [Crying] Okay, this is definitely torture. I've been trying to be a scary pirate for weeks. And then you just waltz in here and nail it on the first try? [blows nose] I can't do anything right. First, I was a ship's lookout, but there was, like, too much to look at and I got distracted, and we hit a duck. He's fine, but it was a whole thing. And then they made me scrub the poop decks, and I totally misunderstood that job. Ew? You know why they call me The Torturer? Because it's torture to be around me. [Crying] Somebody get us out of here! No, no, no, no. Look, hey. It's okay to be terrible at being terrible. [sniffles] It is? [chuckles] Yeah. I mean why would you wanna be a scary pirate anyway? I don't know. I just wanted to be a part of something. Go on adventures with friends. Also I really wanted to steer that big wheely-thingy. Whatever that's called. I mean that... that's the job I really wanted, but you gotta work up to it. Well, we're on an adventure. I mean, well, we were. How about this? If... if you let us out, you can help us on our quest to find The Wishmaker. The Wishmaker? Yeah, join us. You don't belong with these mean kids. And if we ever get our raft back, you can steer. Oh! [yells] Captain! [both grunting] Can't believe you told on us. It's... it's nothing personal, it's just pirate business. [Serena] This Creek, so small, pathetic. I miss the ocean. That's where a real pirate belongs. Wind in your hair, waves beneath your feet. A taste of salt on your lips. Edie, spritz me. [sniffs, exhales] Salty. Now, tell me. Where did you get this? None of your business, sea witch. I'm not talking to the bird feeder, I'm talking to you. Tell me, did you steal it? No, I'm not like you. Oh, really? So, you're not looking for this? [gasps] The other half of the map. [Serena] I found it two summers ago on one of our raids. I've been looking for the other half ever since. But that nosy little explorer beat me to it. So tell me, where is it? - I don't know. - [Serena] Hm. I don't believe that for a second, new kid. That's right. I remember you. Do you remember him? Small Uncle! What have you done to him? He's one of us now, and you could be too, if you tell us where the rest of the map is. What are you talking about? Look, I know what it's like to be a new kid. To be confused, and alone, with nobody to turn to. I can change that for you. Join us. Become a pirate. All your problems will be solved. Ooh, I think a song is coming.

Bring out the plank! Hey! - [plank rattles] - Hey, wait, wait. [Grunts] By the demon blade of Saggaroth, they're taking us to the most vile place in the Creek. Bacterial Infection Pond! [both retching] It smells like old chocolate milk and egg salad. Keep your head up! They say that just looking at it can give you pink eye! I'll give you one last chance. Tell me where the other half of the map is, or sink into the stink. What'll it be, new kid? The name is Craig! And I will never join you! Yeah! You can lick my boots. [Mortimor squawks] Very well. Smell you later then. - Smell you later, forever. - [knife thwacks] [Serena grunting] Wait! We don't have to do this to them. All this stealing and fighting... This isn't what being a pirate is all about. That's exactly what being a pirate's all about. It's, like, the defining feature of a pirate. Okay, historically, yes, but maybe we could be different pirates, you know? Fun pirates. Instead of hitting kids with cannonballs, let's hit 'em with a real specific compliment, you know? Like, Nessie. I think it's so cool how you just sort of appear out of nowhere. I have nightmares about it, but it's... it's a talent. I think my point is, like, we could just be a bunch of friends sailing together on a ship. A Friend Ship! [pirate kids booing] What are you talking about? Ugh! You're torturing us. - Torturer! Torturer! - Torturer! [pirate kids chanting] Torturer! Torturer! Stop saying that! I'm not a torturer! [Teach] Whoa! Whoa! Ugh! Sorry. I... I shouldn't have done that. My... my bad. Are you finished? [Craig] He might be. But I'm just getting started. [pirate kids] Whoa! Oof! After them! Time to fly! Cannonball! ♪ Brighter days ♪ ♪ I feel your sunshine rays ♪ [yelling] ♪ Feeling down ♪ - [air hissing] - [lips flapping] - [yells] - Ah-ha! - [Kelsey grunts] - [air hissing] [Kelsey yells] [JP shudders] You're a genius, JP. [pirate kids yelling] Oh, wow! No one's ever called me a genius before. I mean, I've heard, "Way to go, genius." Heads up! But it was clearly meant sarcastically. Ugh. Yeah, that's the worst. [Cammy] Whoa! Whoo, yes! [Serena] Ready? Aim. What? [gasps] Fire! [water splashing] Ugh! [both] Hm. [Kelsey panting] [screeches] [yells] [both screaming] [Craig grunting] - [Cammy shrieks] - [Craig chuckles] - [water splashing] - Hey! Oh! It's your stuff. And these were yours, right? Yeah. Bleh! Come on, we gotta get out of here. One sec. All right, Craig. This ends now. - Double bounce me. - [Kelsey and JP exclaim] [thrilling music playing] [yelling] [music intensifies] I'll take those. Gah! No! [pirate kids groaning] Well, we're gonna be heading out. Smell you later, Serena. [squeaking] [Craig] Smell you later, forever! Ugh! No. - [spritzing] - Ugh, not now! Pull up anchor! We're going after them. - [horn blowing] - [Serena gasps] Captain, the dinner tuba. Aye, and it's pizza night. Who here is ruthless enough to risk a grounding to please their captain. Stay in the Creek all night if you have to. I want that map. - [distant yelling] - [duck squawking] [all grunting] [all groaning] That was amazing! [JP groaning] [gasps] Man, you were amazing, JP. If it weren't for you, we'd be sunk to the bottom of that pond. Or at least have a really bad rash. Oh, thanks. But it was you guys who saved me from something even more toxic. Bad friends! All right, I'm sorry. It was a bad joke. [shushing] Do you hear that? [laughter nearby] [pirate kid] Think I can small 'em. Here they come. - We gotta hide. - Over there. I'll be right behind you. Okay, Mortimor. - [Mortimor squawks] - [Kelsey] You know what to do. - [Harry] Yo, ho, ho! - [Norman laughing evilly] Yarr! Where they at? You know, guys, I really am having fun with this. - Yarr! - [pirate kids laughing] [Teach] Hm. [leaves rustling] Hm. [chuckling] - [twig snaps] - [Teach] Huh? [Mortimor screeching] I hear sticks. This way. - Good job, Mortimor. - [Mortimor warbles] [Craig] Here it is, - the other half of the map. - Does it fit? [magical music playing] [both gasping] [Craig] The map is complete. Oh, look. That looks like an X. That must be where The Wishmaker is. It's some ancient playground? Whoa, I've... I've never heard of a playground in the Creek before. [Craig] Look, if this is Bacterial Infection Pond, then we're around here. Just need to follow the Creek south, turn this way at the Raccoon Drive-In, and there's The Wishmaker. Ugh, we can't go now. The pirates are still looking for us. It's not safe to go out till they go to bed. When do you think that is? Well, judging by the splashes, I'd say they're seventh graders. So, they could be up until nine, ten o'clock. - What? - Ten? - That's late. - I mean, I could stay up till 8:30, but that's on a good night. [cell phone vibrating] [Craig gasps] My mom! Uh, uh. Okay, okay, okay. [shushing] Shut it! Hi, Mommy. [Nicole] Hey, sweetie. Where are you? You're not hungry for dinner? [Craig] Um, you know, I was actually gonna call you, but I've been busy, um... [Nicole over phone] Hello? Craig? Craig? Are you still at that Creek? No, no, no, no. I'm at, uh, Kelsey's house. [Nicole] Kelsey? Yeah. Um, you remember that brave girl who helped me get home the other day? Well, I ran into her again, and she asked me if I wanted to sleepover. [Nicole] A sleepover? [sighs] Let me at least talk to her parents. She wants to talk to your dad. [whimsical music playing] Okay, um, yeah. Here's... here's Kelsey's dad. [JP clears throat] [in hoarse voice] Hello, Craig's mom. [both exclaiming] Uh, hello. This is Craig's mom, Nicole. [JP] Kelsey's dad. Pleased to meet your phone-quaintance. Do you have a cold or something? [chuckles] I'm just suffering from the condition called "old." Well, are you sure you don't mind having Craig over? [JP] Oh, no. The kids are having so much fun. They're like puppies in a basket. [Nicole] Okay, well. Let me swing by real quick, and drop off some pajamas for Craig, - and a toothbrush. - [in normal voice] No. [in hoarse voice] No! That will not be necessary. See, I... I work at a pajama and a toothbrush factory. Uh, PJ's. PJ and Toothbrush Emporium. [Nicole] The one off 270? [JP] Yep, family-owned and operated. I can give you a tour if you want, but it caught fire. Sorry! Well, thank you for being so neighborly, but, um, can you put Craig on again, please? No problem-omino! [in normal voice] Oh, my gosh. That was a close one. Uh, well, Mom? Can I stay? I don't know, Craig. But, Mom, I'm actually playing with other kids, and making friends here. [sniffles] Isn't that... what you wanted? I'm getting sleepover invitations left and right. Please... [Nicole grunting] [sighs] Okay, Craig. You can have your little sleepover at your new friend's house. But you better call me or your dad if anything comes up, okay? - Got it? - Got it. Thanks so much, Mom. We're having a sleepover! - Sleepover! - I can't believe that worked! [laughs] So, what's for dinner? Let mama see what she's got in her purse. [JP] Wow! Thanks, Mom. [upbeat music playing] [JP munching] Mm. [Mortimor squawking] [Kelsey squawking] [gulps] Hey, thanks for calling my dad too. You're pretty good at doing those voices, JP. Yeah. I order pizza when my mom's coming home late, so... [imitates adult voice] I'm pretty used to talking to grown-ups. [chuckles] Wait, did you take apart your choco-roll? Uh-huh. It's a three-course meal. Chocolate shell appetizer, cake part for the main course, and the cream for dessert. You're so weird. [Kelsey squawking] [sighs] I'm tuckered out! I guess we'd better get some rest then. At first light tomorrow, we'll head to the Raccoon drive-in, and then eastwards to the ancient playground. You guys, I have a confession to make. This is my first sleepover. It's not a sleepover, it's a hideout. And it's my first hideout too. Me too, actually. What? For real? Oh, I would've pegged you both as, like, sleepover pros. Like, sleepovers? Yeah, once a week. No big deal. [Chuckles] Pfft! Well, I've never been invited to one. You know, probably because I do better with books than other kids. [sighs] Books are easier to read. I was actually supposed to go to a sleepover at my friend Bryan's house. But then we moved here. My gosh, this is perfect. First sleepover/hideout. Okay, okay, okay, okay. We gotta do sleepover stuff. Okay, um, who do you have a crush on? No, too soon. Okay, uh... How about when you guys get to The Wishmaker, what are you going to wish for? Oh, maybe muscles? Bigger muscles. Um, well... [sighs] I've always wanted to be like the brave knights and noble warriors in my books, but to be a hero, you need something to fight for. I guess I wish I had something like that. Wow! Okay, so... The obvious one for me is infinite wishes. But if I only had one, well, you know, I... [sighs] I've never felt like I really fit in with the other kids my age. I've just never, like, been into the things they're into, which is fine. But sometimes I wish that I had a group of friends who, like, understood me, like, like me for who I am. Which is why I would wish for clones. Clones of myself. Like a whole softball team of JPs, 'cause, look, I mean, who's gonna be better at understanding me than more mes. And then if you had a lot, you know, if you lost one in a flood or something, it'd be... it'd be not a big deal. What about you, Craig? [gasps] Huh? What? What are you gonna wish for? Oh, um... Probably to go back home... to get a million choco-rolls. [chuckles] Man, am I hungry. May... maybe a little less heartfelt than the other wishes, but life is about the simple pleasures. Get those choco-rolls, yeah? Yeah. Uh, look, I'm getting pretty tired, so I think I'm gonna go to sleep. - [crickets chirping] - [water sloshing softly] [tense music playing] [snoring] [all snoring] Sorry, but it's better this way. I didn't come to the Creek to make friends. I came to find a way home, to my real home. [lively music playing] [yelps] [shudders] [grunts] Phew! [grunting] [grunts, yells] Hmph! [both snoring] [JP muttering] Well, I... I can steer it if nobody else wants to. - Whee! - [Kelsey grunts] - Will you roll over? - Man overboard! - What? What's happening? - You were snoring like a Yeti. Where's Craig? Craig? Craig? Oh! He ditched us! Why would he do that? We're sleepover buddies. I was this close to telling him who my crush is. It's Belinda Doghouse. We weren't sleepover buddies! And it wasn't a sleepover. He was using us to get The Wishmaker! And he got what he wanted, now he's skipping out on us. Oh, hi, guys. [water splashing] Captain, we found 'em. [Craig] Raccoon Drive-In. [scary music playing] [Craig screams] [panting] [yelps] [groaning] [yells] [grunting] [exhales] [grunts] This is it? This is the ancient playground? There's no slides, no swings. There's just a bunch of messed up trees and a rusty old merry-go-round. Where's The Wishmaker? [Grunts] [creaking] [mystical music playing] [gasps] The Wishmaker. Hm. [grunting] [air hissing] [pleasant music playing] [metal creaking] [dramatic music playing] It's a slide. This should be fun. Let me just ease my way down... [yelps] [Craig yelling] ♪ I've got a killer headache It hurts to think ♪ ♪ I've got a splitting headache It hurts to think ♪ ♪ It really stinks ♪ ♪ Oh, well, man Them's the breaks It's gonna hurt ♪ [groans] Ah! Huh? Whoa! So this is the ancient playground. It must have sunk into the sandbox. [gasps] Whoa! But where am I gonna find The Wishmaker? Oh. Probably right there. Time to grab this thing and wish myself home. [panting] [yelps] [clatters] [frightening music playing] [screams] [grunts] [exhaling] What kind of sick game is this? Wait a minute. It's hopscotch. Oh, I don't think I've ever actually played hopscotch. Do you step on the one with or without the stone? Oh, let me just see if I [tile clatters] [worms chittering] Well, that answers that. All right, here goes nothing. [grunting] Huh? [sighs] Oh, boy. - Gotta do this just right. - [worm chittering] [screams] [yelping] [breathing heavily] [sighs] This place is more dangerous than I thought. I better watch my step. - [snaps] - [metal creaking] [groans] Ow! Huh? [swings clinking] Ugh! Good thing this is a hand-me-down. [exhales] Okay, Craiggy. You got this. [blowing air] [grunting] [exhales] Dang! I did that. [scoffs, yelps] [grunting] All right, I just gotta get up there. All the way up there. Well, I didn't come this far just to let a few monkey bars stop me. [panting] [grunting] [metal clanking] Uh-oh. - [yelps] - [bars rattling] [yelping] [bars crashing] [panting] [grunts] [bars crashing] Huh? Dandelions. Whoa. [inhales deeply] [blows air] [mystical music playing] The Wishmaker. I can finally go home. What's the code again? [gasps] The diary. Hm. [exhales] Okay. [reading repeatedly] Got it! Just gotta make my wish, and then it's back to my real home, back to my real friends. Red. R-E-D. [trilling] [gasps] They'll never believe I made friends with a warrior, her deadly falcon, and a pirate who was really in touch with his emotions. Uh... Five. One, two, three, four, five. [trilling] They'll never believe I already had my first sleepover, and had the most fun I've ever had in my life, and it was here in the Creek. Would they believe me? Would they remember me? Bryan didn't even remember my name. [exhales] Four. One, two, three... [JP] Craig! [Craig] Huh? - [Mortimor squawking] - I'm sorry, buddy. He's not our buddy, JP. Ahh! Let go of me. Don't go wishing anything stupid, kid. Just hand it over. Uh... Oh, my gosh! Behind you! A three-headed monkey. What? [thrilling music playing] [Craig yells] [grunts] No! Finally. I can get my wish. [clears throat] Thank you so much for doing all the hard work fetching The Wishmaker for me. You really are a lifesaver. Now, how do those instructions go? Red, five, four. [laughing mischievously] Don't do it, Serena. Your wish, it's too dangerous. It'll destroy the Creek, it'll destroy the town, it'll destroy all of us. Well, should've joined the crew when you had the chance. Now, red. R-E-D. [trilling] [Serena] One, two, three, four, five. [trilling] [chuckles] One, two, three, four. I wish for this pathetic little Creek to be as wild as the ocean. [whispers] It will be so. [trilling] [rumbling] Huh? [laughing maniacally] [metal clanking] - [Teach grunts, pants] - [Craig grunts] Everybody, run! [thunder rumbling] [Teach panting] [Craig grunts] No. The Creek, it's flooding. Finally, it's happening. Teach, Nessie, Kraken. Climb aboard. It's time to set sail. - [thunder rumbling] - [Kraken Kid shuddering] [wood creaking] Uh, I think I hear my mom calling. - I'm getting out of here. - [Kraken Kid yelling] [Serena] Wait. Where are you going? Fine, leave! [grunts] I'll just wish for another crew. How could you lead Serena right to The Wishmaker? What? We didn't have a choice. But they never would've found us if you hadn't ditched us. Why did you do that, Craig? I though we were friends. I thought we were friends too. That's the problem. I don't want new friends. I don't want to like this place. I wanted to wish myself back to my old home, to my old friends, to my real friends. [thunder rumbling] I... I... I didn't... That's not what I meant. [gasps] [all screaming] [all yelling, grunting] [Serena grunting] Serena, give me your hand. [Serena grunts] Serena, now! [Serena grunting] - Ahh! - [Craig] Serena! [grunting] [yelps] Oh, my gosh! She really did it. She turned the Creek into an ocean. No. [all screaming] Oh, my gosh! This is terrible. My socks are getting drenched. You're worried about your socks? The creek is being destroyed, and we're gonna die! Well, if I'm gonna die, I don't wanna be squishing around when I do it. What are we gonna do? We're gonna stop this. But how? By getting The Wishmaker back. We've got a ship and a pirate to steer it. What? Me? You were born to steer that big wheely-thingy. No! No! This quest is a fool's errand. Look at this flood, Craig. It's hopeless. Kelsey, think about the heroes in your books. Would they retreat just because they thought they couldn't win? No. We have to try. This is your home. And now that I've met you both, I want it to be my home too. Because I've never had friends like you before. I didn't want to admit it, but it's true. So, what do you say? You had me at hero, then you won me at home, then you said, "Friend." What are we waiting for? Let's go! [upbeat music playing] First mate JP, set a course for over there. I'm doing it. [Laughs] I'm doing it! Whoa! [gasps] Look out! [grunts] [grunting] [Craig] Whoa! [all screaming] Whoo! [Laughs] [chuckles] Wow! [chuckles] There it is. I see The Wishmaker. [grunts] Hold on! [thrilling music playing] [groans] [weakly] Land ho. [Craig grunts] [yelps] [muffled] Craig. What? I said, "Craig." [staff clatters] [growls] Serena, can't you see? Your wish is out of control. I can't let you undo it, Craig. I just can't. [grunts] [Kelsey yells] [Serena straining] [Kelsey grunting] [Serena grunting] [Kelsey grunts] Why are you helping him? He can't possibly be paying you enough. [Kelsey] Kelsey smirked a smirky smirk. She was no longer the hapless mercenary the Creek kids called, "Weird bird girl." Nay! She was Kelsey The Brave! [thunder rumbling] I'm not doing this for snacks. I'm doing this to save my friends, and to save the Creek! - [yells] - [gasps] [weapons clashing] [Serena groans] [whooshing] [gasps] [sighs] This thing isn't gonna last much longer in the rain. Make the wish! Stop the flood! Red. R-E-D. [trilling] [Craig] Five. One, two, three, four, five. [grunts] Four. One, two, three, four. - [trilling] - [Serena grunts] What? [exhales] Huh? [yelps, pants] Where am I? Inside of The Wishmaker. [gasps] Where did everyone go? Where's the Creek? [voices] I wish. What the heck is this? These are the wishes of kids who came before us. Each of these folds contains a wish. Or a wish yet to be made. Whoa. Did you really think you could get rid of me? I've been searching for The Wishmaker for too long. I'm not gonna let you undo my wish. [Craig groans] [voices] I wish to be beautiful. Huh? [Craig groans] What the... Huh? Huh? Oh, looking good, Craiggy. [chuckles] But I don't care how beautiful I look. I'm not gonna let you destroy the Creek. [voices] I wish to be fast. Huh? [energy crackling] Hm. [grunts] [grunts] [Serena grunting] [voices] I wish to be strong. Huh? [groans] [laughs evilly] Uh-oh! [Craig shrieks] [Serena grunts] Uh, I need another wish. [Serena grunts] [voices] I wish for laser eyes. - [heavy metal music playing] - [laser whooshing] [Serena grunting] [voices] I wish to be invisible. - Huh? - [Serena laughing] Where'd she go? [Craig screams] Ow! [Grunts] Got you! Ow! Cut it out! [Groans] [yelping] [thuds] [voices] I wish to be taller. Hmph. [Serena groans] [lips flapping] [thuds] [voices] I wish I was Mr. Fluffy Boo-Boo. [Serena] I'm gonna... Huh? - [gentle music playing] - [Serena] Who... Who would wish for this? [Craig laughs] What are you gonna do with your widdle paws? - [Serena yelling] - [Craig screaming] [grunts] [both groan] - Ahh. - [birds squawking] - Huh? - [waves crashing] Whoa! What is this? Are we in a wish? Yeah. Mine. [trilling] Huh? [Grunts] [grunting] Wait, I thought you wanted to flood the Creek? Yeah, so I could sail away to here. My home. I had everything here. Sunshine, palm trees, my best friends right next door. And the ocean in my backyard. In the summer we'd get ice cream near the shops. And ride our bikes by the twig huts. [chuckles] That's what we called them. My friends and I used to joke about how a hurricane could come and knock them all down. Oh! [all laughing] And if a hurricane would come, I'd get on my boat and let the ocean take me away. But then my parents dragged me to this stupid town. With no friends, no ocean, and only this tiny Creek to play in. I vowed to do anything I could to get back there. Yeah, that was my wish too. I wanted to go back to my old home. It wasn't as beautiful as yours, but it was everything to me. When I first moved here, I hated this town. Everything was wrong. Even the smell. It was all not right. But in looking for a way to go back, I did get to know this place. And I realized that I was just scared. And that maybe there's more for me here than I thought. And maybe there can be more for you too, if you give it a chance. [Serena grunting] [groans] Huh? [crying] Uh, what the... [Craig yelling] What's happening? [Craig] It's your wish. [pants] The Wishmaker it's being destroyed by the rain. [yells] Help me! [Serena grunts] [Craig coughing] Serena, we have to undo your wish. Or else everyone in and outside the creek will be in danger. We don't have much time. We gotta find an empty fold. One without a wish. - There. - [grunts] Serena! [grunting] [Serena coughs] There's water shooting out everywhere. [Craig] How are we gonna get all the way up there? [breathing heavily] I think I know how. [upbeat music playing] [Spanish song playing] Craig. [Craig panting] We gotta make the wish now. I... I wish... [Serena breathing heavily] Ahh! [exhales] I wish that this flood [both] would stop! [gasps] Mm. [gasps] The rain. It's all over. [Chuckles] We did it, Serena. We saved the Creek. [air hissing] No! My ship! [ship deflating] [pleasant music playing] JP? Craig! Craig? [Grunts] [Kelsey and JP laughing] - [JP] Oh, my gosh! - [Kelsey] Craig! [all cheering] [Craig laughing] What happened? There was, like, all this lightning, and it looked like you disappeared. And the... the rain. It just stopped, and... - You did it! - [Mortimor squawks] We did it. All of us. [Serena] It's over. [birds chirping] [Jessica sighs] We were so young. [knocking on door] [exclaims] What? Small Uncle! [Jessica exclaims] [cheers] - [Small Uncle squelches] - [Jessica] Mm. - Ew! - [laughs] Thanks, Craiggy. [joyful music playing] Rawr! - Now I got you, Craig. - [both laughing] [Craig giggling] All right, your room is all ready. It's perfect. [Duane] Welcome home, my guy. Enjoy it, hon. [Craig] Dear, Hannah. I hope you're doing well at your new house. I know the move must've been hard. You had to leave your home and the creek. It's still pretty wild there, but kids are having a lot more fun without the pirates stealing their stuff all the time. All right, y'all. We're fully stocked and back in business. [Craig] Some of the pirates even decided to play nice for a change. [Kit exclaims nervously] Do you accept apologies? Mm. No? How about donations? [pirate kids] Yeah. [Craig] Not all of them chose to stay though. Sorry about your ship. [Serena] Ah, it's okay. I don't need that thing anymore. I spent so much time trying to control these waters, maybe it's time I see what these waters can show me. Give the Creek a second chance. Who knows? Maybe it'll give me one too. I think it will. [Serena] Hm. Smell you later, kid. Smell you later too, captain. Thanks for leaving me your diary. I'm not sure what you were wishing for, but I wanna wish you good luck. Yo, those garlic knots were sick! - For me it's all about that Caesar salad. - Caesar salad. [giggles] Bernard. [Craig] Sometimes what you want can feel so far away. But if you take a look around, it might be closer than you think. If you ever wind up back in Herkleton, you should look me up. You'll know where to find me. Sincerely, Craig of the Creek. [both] Hey, Craig. So, what do you guys wanna do today? Explore a dungeon, slay a dragon. We could put a bunch of leaves on my tummy, see which ones give me rashes. Sounds fun. But what do you think about making our own map of the entire Creek? - Yeah, we got nothing better to do. - Yeah, I've got, like, three hours before dinner. We could squeeze it in. Let's go, then.
