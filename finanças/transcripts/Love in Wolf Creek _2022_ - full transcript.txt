Thanks for calling this in. [Hiker] Seems like it came from up there. Animal Rescue's on their way. Hey, morning, Sheriff. Are you okay with me recording this? Sure, Sunny. You do your thing. Morning, Sam. Sheriff Munn. Let's see what we've got here. You know what folks, let's just move aside and give Ms. Gavin some space to work. Hello there, little guys! Looks like we got three little eagles waiting to see the world. Still warm? Ah, warm enough, I think. But I've got to get them into an incubator - now. Sam is an expert on birds. She does this sort of thing all the time. She's my sister! Another great job, Sam! Give me a call when they hatch. I will. Sam! Say something really cool to animal lovers everywhere. Ahhh... We will get them back to our wildlife refuge. Okay. Sunny, we got to get these guys into the incubator. Sounds good, sis. Sunny. Get off your phone. Sorry. So I'm headed up to Highway 70. We got a call this morning. Spotted a wolf, with four cubs in tow. Really? Sweet! They're finally migrating back to Wolf Creek. It certainly seems that way. Okay, we should notify the public that the wolves are back just so they can be extra cautious in the parks. Yeah, we have every local radio station spreading the word. - Thanks, Sheriff. - No problem. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ These will be safe until they're ready to hatch. We are going to have to build a big space for them to grow into. Sam! The Refuge's socials are blowing up right now. Look! Look how many views you have. Oh, you posted that? Yeah. You already have over a thousand likes. What? If there's no photo, it never happened. Right, but for the animals it actually needs to happen, whether or not there's a photo. Okay. Can't there be both, though? Yeah, but the work comes first. Look, it's great that people love these flashy rescues, but that's only a small part of what I'm trying to do here. I know. You deserve recognition for all the boring stuff you do too. I don't need recognition, the Refuge needs funding! Likes and views do not pay the bills. I could be doing so much more. Because saving abandoned eagle eggs and single-handedly bringing an entire wolf population back to Wolf Creek through your unrelenting advocacy all before... What is it? Nine a.m. That's not enough for you? No. No. The animals deserve bigger and better enclosures, and, we're running out of feed for the horses, so... You have not had your morning coffee yet, have you? No. I knew it! I am putting on a pot, STAT.

I have been trying to get a meeting with them for a month! They run the Tri-State Animal Protection Fund. They could change everything for us. Hi, ah, Ms. Baker... Call me Livia. It is wonderful to speak with you. [Livia] I'll cut right to the chase here. I've added Wolf Creek Wildlife Refuge to the shortlist for our support. [Samantha] Oh, my goodness. That is incredible! You can thank yourself. Your eagle egg rescue video was quite endearing. So caring. Well I was just glad that I got to those little guys in time. They are doing really well in the incubator. [Livia] Well, that clip definitely shone a light on you, but tell me... Why is your Refuge the right place for our donation? Oh, well, we are located on protected conservation land, and we're close to town, so we protect domesticated animals and wildlife, doesn't matter how big or small. [Livia] Right... Uh, and, umm... having a fear of confined spaces myself, I I empathize with the animals being taken out of their natural environments and put into small unnatural spaces. Huh! That's a fresh take. And very photogenic. The Board will like that. [Livia] I mean, I'll have to see it for myself. Oh, of course. We would love to give you a tour of the facility. We are very proud of it. Fab. I'll tell my pilot. See you tomorrow at 9 a.m. T... Tomorrow? I have to be back in the city by noon. [Livia] Hello? Will that be a problem? Uh... yeah! I, ah, no no no! No. Actually, tomorrow is perfect. Ah, yeah, our animals and staff are always ready for visitors. [Livia] I certainly hope so. Your operation is smaller than we normally fund, but if it's as cute as that video, we may be able to do something. Great! We will see you soon! Views and likes don't pay the bills, huh Sam? There is no way I can get this place presentable and "cute" for tomorrow. Lucky for you, your favorite little sister is here to help you out! Leaking roofs aren't cute, Sunny. Old fences are not cute! Broken latches are not cute! This place is full of your heart and your soul and that is all the animals care about. It doesn't matter what's broken and what needs fixing. And that is what you are going to show Livia tomorrow morning. We just need a little spit polish in this place. Oh, and a nail gun to fix the leaky roof. So I'm going to run into town.

I got a whole herd to watch over. The ranch keeps me real busy. There are more things in the world than being busy. Did you move the garden center to the front of the store? Well, I just thought that those heavy bags would be more convenient for everyone there. We need to find you a place to sit down. Because Dr. Tully said... Dr. Tully is a worrywart! Now look... I asked for you to come here, but I didn't ask for you to treat me like a child. Sometimes a person just needs a little help adjusting to a new path.

It started when I was a kid. I had a dog and it ran into a den in the woods. And I followed it and I got stuck. And I just haven't been able to shake it. We all have our things. I hate earwigs. [SAMANTHA LAUGHS] You're afraid of earwigs? I didn't say I was afraid, I said I didn't like them. Just say 'no' to animals with pincers. [SAMANTHA LAUGHS] Okay, well... I guess a fear of lobsters is understandable. Hey. Scorpions have pincers, too. [SAMANTHA LAUGHS, THEN GETS SERIOUS] But thank you. I don't know if I would've got through this without you. Well, I'm glad I could help. I just wish that there was a way for me to help my Nana. Mariana? She does not strike me as a 'taking help' type. Yeah well, pretty soon she won't have a choice. She has macular degeneration in both of her retinas and she'll be completely blind in six months. She doesn't want to face it. And I can't fix it. Well, maybe you're not supposed to fix it. Maybe just being there like you have been for me, that's enough. The best we can hope for in life is that we don't have to go through it alone. [WEAK WOLF HOWL] That's him! He's alive! And pretty close, by the sounds of it. And did you hear that? That's his pack looking for him. Hey we're going to find him. I promise. How can you be so sure? Because I trust my gut. And I don't give up. Neither do I. Yeah, I didn't think so. Well, um... We should get some sleep if we're going to head out at first light. Yeah. Good night. Good night.
