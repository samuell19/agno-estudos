Are you finished yet? Mm-mm. Honey. You can't fix everything... by staring at a computer all night. I can't fix anything right now. That's the problem. It's just a rough patch. Everyone in the construction industry is in the same situation. Look, I'm not joking. I mean, I don't think we can even make payroll anymore. If one more contract doesn't go through... we're on the streets. Oh, you're overreacting, honey. Hm. I wish. Do you like? It's beautiful, babe. Yeah. Look, um, you're gonna have to stop buying until further notice. Sorry. Fine. I can come into the office tomorrow if you need my help. There's... There's no need. Thank you for offering, but... nothing you can do to help. Look, I promise things will get back to normal soon. Hey, Jeannie! Stop pulling Tommy's shirt. Now! Ten years, that girl's gonna be in jail. Mark my words. Nah. She's adorable. No, they all are. That's where we differ. I have good news. I got accepted. For what? That masters degree program I told you about. In child development. Oh, right. Yeah. Wow! I didn't realize you were that serious about it. Of course. Avery! Are you okay? I'm fine. Mm. I know just the person you need to see. Today. I see the pulpit. Where's the television studio? Uh, back of the auditorium. Second floor. Mm. I've talked to a lot of construction guys like you. They look at me and... see a little Baptist preacher building an itsy bitsy church. What do you see, Robert? A visionary. Who's building a five acre, 20,000 square foot sanctuary. You read my blog? I do my homework. Then you know my congregation expects us to do business with people that share our same values. Of course. So, what do you think? I think you got the job. We want you to build our new church. Mr. Getz, thank you so much. I promise, you will not regret this. I'm counting on it, Robert. All right. Thank you. Thank you. So Morgan decided that she was super woman, and guess what? She's not. Honestly, just give me an ice pack, and I'll be fine. Not quite. You sprained your shoulder pretty badly. So what you need is a really good stretch. Okay? I promise, Isabelle is the best. - Ahh. - Oh, you're just biased. 'Cause I gave you massages all through high school. And I've been bringing you business ever since. Touch√©. I wish my hubby would give me a massage like this. - Mm-hm. - So... how'd it go last night? Did you wear the new lingerie? - Yes. - And? And nothing. He has too much going on right now. I told you. Once men get what they want, they're done with us. And we're supposed to live like Catholic nuns for the rest of our lives? That's my plan. So what about you? You have someone special in your life? No special guy. Or girl. Or girl? Is that a hint of some sort? Maybe. I doubt you let that pretty face and beautiful body go to waste. Trust me, she doesn't. She goes to that club downtown. Secret Sins. What is that, like a nightclub or something? Um... not really. It's a members only adult club for people who aren't afraid to have a little fun. You mean like young, sexy people? I doubt they'll let me through the door. Oh, don't sell yourself short. Oh, gosh, I just remembered. I have to call Robert. He had that very important meeting today. Can you grab my phone for me, please? I want to know how it went. Oh, thank you. - Is that your husband? - Mm-hm. Oh, you guys make the cutest couple. Thank you. Do you have any children? A daughter. Abbey. She's so lucky to have such beautiful parents. Thank you. Hello, hello. - Hi. - How are you? Good. Hi. Thank you for coming. Oh, I want to be in on that. - Hi. - Hi. Oh! I'll be right back. Anna, hi. Isabelle, I... I thought you wouldn't mind if I brought Isabelle along. No, of course not. Come in. - Hi. - Hi. Okay, now we can talk. Honey. I want to introduce you to Isabelle. This is the woman that gave me that great massage I told you about the other day. Oh! So nice to meet you. The pleasure is all mine, sweetheart. - Hey. - Hey, Anna. - I need a drink. - Oh, you know where it is. Ladies, this way. Uh, white wine, Isabelle? - Sure. - All right. - Thank you. - You? - The usual. - Bourbon it is. The house is looking great, guys. I wish I lived in a copy of "House Beautiful" where price is no object. Yeah. Come on, Anna, you know that we're up to our eyeballs in debt. Yes, it's true, but Robert landed a great contract, so quite frankly, I'm not worried. Yeah, well, don't get too comfortable. If anything goes wrong with that great contract, company goes belly up and all this goes away. Yeah, but you could go back to programming, couldn't you? Why don't you ask my wife how many times I've said I'm sick of computers. Oh, my God, it's true. It's been so many years since he's worked in computers. He's a construction guy now, thank you very much. Yeah, I'm big construction guy. - Told you about Avery. - Mm-hm. All right, enough of this now. - No, wait, I was doing something. - I swear you love this thing - more than me. - Hold on. No, wait, wait. Give it back. Abbey, honey, it's getting late. Hey! Sorry, Mom. Just kids having fun. - Right. - And then they grow up and pay bills. Oh, come on! You guys are in the prime of your lives. There's way more fun to be had. Really? Like, what kind of fun? Come on. Tell us all about this club. Secret Sins. Well, why tell you when I could show you. Come on, come out with me tonight. It'll be a lot of fun. Uh, cl... What club? What are you talking about? Isabelle is a member of an adult only private club. Oh, I, uh... No. You have to... You have to count us out. Oh, come on, relax. You only live once. You are something else. I didn't say anything. Okay, I'll go. But only as an observer. Deal. Drivers licenses, please. Club rules. All members have to be registered. Here you go. It's okay. It's not a big deal. - Thank you. - Thank you. Don't worry. After tonight, your husband will be all over you. This is a one-time thing for me. Okay. I have to admit, I didn't think I'd have so much fun. See? Before I started coming here, I was actually incredibly shy. I could barely talk to anybody. Give me a break. I'm serious. I was completely out of touch with my... sensual side. I didn't even know I had one, really. But now I'm completely at ease. In fact, I am not afraid to say that I find you both extremely attractive. Thank you. Uh, the, uh, feeling is mutual. So let me propose... that we spend a little bit more... private time... just the three of us. Okay. Think about it. I'll be back with some more tequila. Okay. You first. Why not? I mean, seriously, why the hell not? Because we're married. That's why not. And nothing's going to change that. It's just a little adventure. Would you feel the same way if it was another man? Yeah, I could never share you with another man. You're right. We are so not ready for this right now. It was a nice thought, though. I think you guys need to get a room. Yeah. So? I'm sorry, Iz. We talked about it, and I don't think we're ready for a little private time. It's... It's just not us. Okay. That's okay. I mean, it's not for everybody. No harm in asking, right? Of course. But, um... this has made me want to, uh, get her home as soon as possible. Okay. Thank you. Sorry. - Thank you. - Bye. I'll call you tomorrow. Oh, and tell Anna we said goodnight. You know, you haven't kissed me the way you kissed me tonight in a very, very long time. You liked that? You know I did. And... I don't need to go to an adult only private club to enjoy the man I love. Pull over. Seriously? Mm-hm. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. I'm so glad you could meet me here today. Me, too. I... I feel awful if I made you uncomfortable last night. - It's okay. - Okay. We had a great time. Good. So did I. You have to tell me how you got involved with the lifestyle. Um... My ex boyfriend introduced me to it. And, you know, initially... I wasn't even considering it, but I decided to just let go of my inhibitions and have some fun. Wow. So, does he go there? Do you see him? Do you run into him? He, uh... He died. In an unfortunate accident. Uh, wow, I'm... I'm so sorry. Thanks. Okay, well, um, I'm looking forward to our friendship. Me, too. Me, too. - Toast to that? - New friends. Cheers. Sure. If it's okay with her mom, it's fine with me. Yeah, she said it's fine. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. - Be good. - I will. - And I love you. - Love you, Mom. Mwah! Abbey has a sleepover tonight. Oh. Sleepovers can be fun. I have to use the little girls room. Where is it again? Uh, it's the same place as the little boys room is. It's down the hall to the left. Perfect. I'll be right back. - Happy? - Yeah, yeah. For the first time in a long time. You know, business is good. Things seem to be getting back on track. Good. Don't stop. I like what I see. Good morning. Good morning, honey. - Coffee? - Yes, please. - Good morning! - Good morning. I don't know about you guys, but after last night, I am famished. Mm. Okay. I don't know how to say this, so, um... I'm just gonna say it. I've fallen in love. With both of you. It's true, I've fallen in love with both of you. Isabelle, you're beautiful, but last night was just... It was... It was an adventure. A one time adventure. Look, I know it sounds crazy, but whenever we're together, I... I just feel like I'm at home. I mean, imagine us loving each other. Living as a family. Oh, it could be so beautiful. Robert and I already have a family, one that we're very happy with. I'm sorry. No, I... There I go again. Assuming things. Um... I'm sorry, I'll just... I'll go. You don't have to leave. Oh, God. Robert and I already have a family, one that we're very happy with. I already have a family, one I am very happy with. - Eva, we have to go. - I don't want to go. We'll find you another family. - No. - Let's go. It's time to go. Come on. Robert and I already have a family, one that we're very happy with. Okay. Okay. I gave myself to both of you, and you rejected me. Me? You are missing out on the greatest thing that ever happened to you. You will pay for this. No one turns me away. I will destroy you! I... I want to apologize. No, I wanted to. Please, come in. So I owe you a big thank you. You saved our marriage. I did? Absolutely. Robert and I have reconnected. That's great. I'm really happy for you. So I'm really sorry I hurt your feelings this morning. No, it's... it's okay. - Really. - Really? Promise. Oh, hey, um... I lost one of my earrings. Is it okay if I go upstairs to see if it's up there? - Of course. - Okay. - Hey. - Hey, girl. So I found this in the VIP. You should probably give him a call. - Right away. - Thank you. Thank you. Hello? Hi. Hi, this is Diane from Secret Sins. I found your credit card. I hardly ever carry that card. Where did you say you found it? Well, it doesn't matter. It's in lost and found, and we've got it here for you. Uh, yeah, I must have dropped it there the other night. That's okay. You can come down... Um, yeah, I'll... I'll be there as soon as I can to get it. All right. - Great. We'll have it here for you. - Thank you. Hey, I, uh... I left a credit card here the other night. Robert DeAngelo. Thank you so much. Thank you. - Robert. - Yes. - There you go. - Thank you so much. Hey, do you come here often? Uh, no, no, I don't. I've only been here one time before. - One time? - Do you want to dance? No, I just came here to get a lost credit card. - I have to go. - Oh, come on. Oh, I... I can't dance. - Oh, sure you can. - I'm the worst. Show me some of those moves. You're so delicious. I have to go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have to go. I have to go. Thank you, though. Bye. - Bye. - Thank you. - Thank you ladies. - Thank you. When I was younger, I... I didn't always look like this. I was really overweight. Oh, come on. You were born beautiful. No, I wasn't. But anyway... you look amazing. Thank you. Although I'm sure Robert would prefer me a little thinner. No, he loves you just the way you are. So do I. What's wrong? Nothing. I really am happy for you guys. I mean, I... wish it would have been me. But I am happy that you decided to embrace the open marriage policy. What are you talking about? Oh... Wow, I... I thought you knew. Knew what? I saw Robert at the club last night. There were women all over him. He looked like he was having a really good time. No. No way. Robert's not that kind of guy. I mean, he and I have problems, but he has always been faithful. If you say so. When I was at the club last night... and please forgive me if I've overstepped my bounds... but I took some pictures. I really thought you should know. I've seen it before. Seen what before? The perfect husband. Straight arrow guy. You know, he gets a taste of the club and... just loses control. That's not Robert. Okay? Do me a favor. Text me these pictures, and then delete them. I'm gonna go take care of this right now. I hope you don't mind. Excuse me. Okay, I'm... I'm sorry. No, I'm not. Morgan! Hi. Uh, Robert is really busy. Sandy, please. Construction starts next week. Uh, yes, sir. All right. Uh, th-thank you, thank you so much, Mr. Getz. All right. And... And thank you again for this fantastic opportunity. All right. Bye. Babe, what's wrong? Is Abbey okay? - Did something happen? - Abbey's just fine. But you decided to have a little fun last night. Fun? What... What kind of fun? What do you mean? Oh, please. I just had lunch with Isabelle. - She told me everything. - Babe, slow down. I have no idea what you're talking about. Why didn't you tell me you went to Secret Sins last night? Oh... Oh, for God's sake, no. The club called. Apparently, when we were there, my credit card dropped out of my wallet, and so I went back to get it. Really? Then what is this? Isabelle saw you. She took pictures of you. It looks like you and your lady friends were having a blast. Babe, I went there to get a lost credit card, and those girls jumped me. Okay? You know the kind of thing that happens at that place. So why did you have to go by yourself? It... It was on the way from the office. So you could have just cancelled the card and got a new one. You're acting crazy. Nothing happened. I'm not acting crazy. You know what? I'm not buying it. Sell it to someone else. Of course I wasn't spying on you. Well, then, why'd you take the photos? I honestly thought that you and Morgan had opened your marriage. I... I thought that she would enjoy the photos. Yeah, well, she didn't. And now, thanks to you, our marriage is in trouble. I swear, I would never do anything to hurt either of you. I... I guess I just... I wasn't thinking. Yeah, obviously. Things are just really difficult over here right now. I... I don't have a lot of appointments, and... and I'm just... I'm kind of freaking out, so would... would you please just... please just forgive me. Okay, look, calm... calm down, okay? Look, I'll talk to Morgan tonight, I'm sure everything will be fine. Just no more photos, okay? I swear, I promise, no more photos. All right, things will get better for you. Business moves in cycles so... You're right. It does. Okay, well, I have to go. Yeah, bye. Hm. Miss Anderson. Is that leg still bothering you? Come on. Let's take care of that, shall we? I want to believe you, I really do. Well, have I ever given you a reason to doubt me? Not yet. Well? Well? You don't seem to have any interest in me unless there's another woman involved. That's not fair. And also, you know, it's normal that a couple's sex life slows down a little bit as they get older. It's just normal. Well, I can't understand "slows down," but completely disappears? I mean, I don't know what else to do. I don't either. So, on the one hand, he's probably telling the truth. But on the other, I still don't understand why he went there by himself. Well, honey, instead of replaying it over and over again in your head, why don't you just go to the club... by yourself, and give him a taste of his own medicine? Oh, I can never do that. Hell, yes, you can. I am a one-man woman. I've never strayed in 20 years. Girl, you need a double. I mean, seriously, just go. Do it. Give him a taste of his own medicine. You know, I can't figure out if you're a good influence or a bad one. Oh, bad. Definitely bad. Okay, fine. I'll go. And I'm gonna be the hottest girl on the dance floor. Hell yes! - Great. - Yes! See? This is what I'm talking about. There is nothing better... than people looking at you. Wanting you. Nothing. Well, you're used to this, but it's gonna take some time for me. Hey, you guys, can I get a shot for table five? So what are we gonna do now? Well, you just stand here and look sexy, and I'll go get us a couple of drinks. I'm sorry. Excuse me. - Excuse... - Hey! Where are you goin'? This isn't for me, Isabelle, I'm sorry. Robert thinks we're at the movies, and I think that's what we should do. Just stay for the one drink. - Okay, just one. - Okay. To friendship. To friendship. - Hey. - Oh... Where am I? I'm taking you home, sweetie. Don't worry. Everything's fine. You could have gone all night. You put on quite a show back there. Uh, what kind of show? Well, first there was one guy. Then two. Oh! It was hot. Hot as in sex hot? Yeah. You were supposed to have my back. I did! You kept telling me you were fine. That you finally felt free. Oh, stop the car. What wr... Honey, you are in no condition to get out of the car. - Open the door. - Okay, okay. Take me home, please. Oh... You okay? I don't know how it happened. I'm not here to judge. I'm here to help. Any idea how many partners you had that night? Well, the STD results should be back within 24 hours. In the meantime, stay out of trouble. Oh, God. And how's Abbey doing? Abbey's good. Thank you for asking. Yeah. Uh... Uh, I think I forgot my phone in the store. - I'll meet you at the car. - Okay. All right. Isabelle. Hi. I was just out shopping with... Anna. I know. I saw. I tried calling you. You mad or something? What do you think? I should have never let you take me to the club that night. I would have never done the things you said I did. Look, you just got caught up in the moment. You were having fun, that's all. How could you even say that? I'm a married woman. It's like I was drugged or something. And it's caused huge problems for me and Robert. I even had to get an STD test. Look, why don't you, Robert and I just... sit down and have a conversation. Like a family. It'll be fine. No, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I don't think you and I should hang out for a while. Hey, Isabelle. We just finished shopping if you want to come join us for coffee. Nah, I'm good. You girls have fun. Okay. Honey, dinner's getting cold. I can explain. You can explain an STD test? Well, I was so damn upset that you went to the club the other night that I just wanted to make sure I didn't catch anything from you. What? Well, how do I know what you did after you picked up your credit card. There was two women all over you in that picture that I saw. We've been married how long, and you think that I would do that to you? Really? I don't know. Well, the good news is that I don't have an STD, which means you don't either. You never did. Oh, my... - Ooh! - Oh! I don't know. Someone said two guys and their girlfriends. Bartender, I think we need a couple drinks over here. Oh, come on, come on, come on. Come on! Yes. It's all good. Big meeting today. We're gonna finalize plans for the church, - so wish me luck. - Good luck, honey. But... food? - Off to school. - I love you, honey. Food? Breakfast? - Love you. - Have a good day. Oh, my God. Oh, no. This can't be happening. What is this? Oh, my God. Robert. We are down to the wire, so whatever it is, it can wait. Actually... this can't. Has Mr. Getz called? Not yet. But the potential clients that we lined up because of the church job, they all cancelled their appointments. Every one. I told them that someone is trying to hurt you. I know this can't be true. Of course it's not. This is somebody's idea of a sick joke. Who's seen this? Um... Everyone. Tell 'em to get back to work. Okay. Isabelle! My whole life is destroyed. Your life? All of my patients cancelled their appointments. How am I gonna pay rent? I'm gonna lose everything. I thought you're the one that posted that list. Why would I have posted that list? My name was on it. That's my private life. I don't just share that with anybody. This can't be happening. Oh, my God. Somebody is out to ruin us. Oh, my God. Do Abbey and Robert know? When they left this morning, they didn't know, but I'm sure they know by now. I'm sure everybody knows. It's... It's out there. We're gonna be okay. And you know why? Because we have each other. Okay? Okay. It's a sad day for all of us. Look, Mr. Getz, I can assure you, there's been some sort of terrible mistake. - I'll say. - Look, my wife and I, all we did is is we went dancing there. Somebody clearly edited that video to make her look that way. We had such high hopes when we came to you. We were sure you were the right man for the job. I am. No, we can't be in business with people that don't share our values. Look, Mr. Getz, come on. We... We've been working on the blueprints for weeks now. We are ready to make you the most beautiful church. And you expect my congregation to flock to a house of God that's been built by a man whose wife has sex with other men? On camera. I had so many plans for us. What a disappointment. Look, I... I'm no expert on the Bible, but I know that it talks about forgiveness. Do not quote scripture to me, son. I can't go back to school. They'll just laugh at me 'til graduation day. Oh, look, it's Abbey. You know what her mom is. No doubt she'll follow in her footsteps. Abbey, honey, it's not what it seems. Really? 'Cause from the videos everyone's seen, it's pretty clear it's exactly what it seems. Abbey, I don't remember any of it. I swear. It's like I was drugged or something. I don't know, but your mom would never do something like that. But you did. People make mistakes. Joey broke up with me today because of your mistakes. I'm sorry. What do I have now, a mom who's a perv? What would you have said if I had done it? I'm sorry. Don't touch me. Oh, my God. Where are you going? Why do you care? Don't talk to me like that. I'll be at Stacy's. She said I could stay there 'til this all blows over. Who knows how long that'll take. I saw the video. Babe, I'm sorry. How many guys were there that night? I don't remember. I just remember getting there, and then waking up in Isabelle's car. That's all I remember, I swear. I guess that explains the STD test. Here's the thing, Bob, you do have rights when a club claims to be private, but you have to prove who's responsible for leaking the names. You're kidding. I have to prove it? What am I, Sherlock Holmes? Well, kinda, unless evidence falls from the sky, you have basically no legal recourse whatsoever. Well, then I guess it's gonna be a piece of cake you helping me with what I need now. I want a trial separation. Oh, no, that's a bad idea. Once you get to that point, it almost always leads to divorce. And as your lawyer, and as your best friend, I don't think you want that. I can't be in the same house with her, Ben. Not while this is going on. I need to get out. All right. If you really decide to go through with it, I have a small place you can rent in town. It's been vacant a few months. I was actually about to place an ad. Well, don't. I'll take it. Okay. Thanks, Ben. So, as you can see, I have no other choice. Please. Someone is trying to ruin me, my life, my career, everything. I feel for you, I do, but my first priority is the children. As is mine. I love those kids. Please, I would never do anything to hurt them. I am sorry, Morgan. Please, just let me continue. I can't. I can't. It's against policy. You need to leave. At least for now. I need your ID. I am sorry. We have to sell the cars, we have to get rid of the country club memberships, and we have to sell the vacation home. Everything? Yeah, that's what happens when you declare bankruptcy. Everything goes. And I'd keep my distance from you little play pal there. I'm pretty sure that Isabelle had something to do with this. No. Her name was on the list, too. She's gonna lose her business. She's suffering just like we are. I doubt it. I'm sleeping downstairs tonight. Babe, don't do that. Babe, please. Hey, it's Abbey. Leave a message. Hey, Abbey, it's Dad. Would you please call me back when you get this? Thank you. Dad called. He gave me the key to his new place. Mom, I'm sorry. Honey, I'm sorry. None of this is your fault. I need your help staging the house, okay? Okay. We have no idea who did it. Yeah, well, somebody from this club uploaded that list. A disgruntled employee. A drunk customer. Somebody's ex. Look, buddy, I've lost 30 percent of my clientele already. They're asking me for refunds. I've got a truck load of lawsuits coming at me. Can you blame them? The list was supposed to be confidential. Are you listening to anything I'm saying? I'm losing my shirt here. If I knew who it was, I'd be singing like Aretha Franklin! Well, you have to have some sort of idea. Look, you look like a smart guy. You think you could fix this mess? I just might be able to. - Hey. - Hi. I just wanted to check on you. I left you a couple of messages, and I haven't heard back so... Please, come in. Thanks. I didn't have my phone on me all day because we had an open house today. Looks like we sold the house. Wow. - Hey. - Hey! So, I'm about to make dinner. You want to join us? Um, I... I'd love to. Thank you. Okay, why don't you guys hang out, and I'll let you know when dinner's ready. Okay. She's going through such a hard time. Thanks so much for being there for her. Of course. Trust me, it's my pleasure. He was such a sweet guy. Your boyfriend? Ex because, you know... the video. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. You'll find someone new, I promise. I don't know. I'm not like you. You know, beautiful. Thank you, Abbey. But I didn't always look like this. People used to call me fat and ugly and... it got so bad that I, um... thought about killing myself. My gosh. But... then I met someone and things turned around. So I promise you... you'll meet someone new. I mean, you're beautiful. Yes, you are. You just don't realize it. Look, it just so happens that I have my fantastic bag of tricks. How about I show you? Come on. How's it going, ladies? We'll be right down. Okay, dinner's being served. Hold on, hold on, hold on, we're almost there. Okay. All right. You can turn around. Wow. Now every boy will be lining up to talk to you at school. Thank you. Totally welcome. Okay, now let me finish. Can I tell you a secret? Of course. I've never been to a club before. My mom won't let me go. You're kidding me, right? No. I'm one of those nerds. You know, straight A's, don't smoke, don't drink, still a virgin. My mom's really big on abstinence. Or was. Look, those are all really great things. But sometimes a girl's just gotta dance, right? Do you think anyone would want to dance with me? Absolutely. Mom. What do you think? Isabelle did it. Isn't she pretty? Is this some kind of a joke, Isabelle? No, we just thought that, you know... Mom, we thought that the three of us could go out after dinner and... and it would be like a new life sort of thing. Why don't you like it? You're too young to be dressed like this, Abbey. You have no idea what's going on. Okay, I was just trying to get her to express herself. Oh, so now you're criticizing the way I raise my daughter? Mom! Okay, you know what? It's all right. We'll do it another night. Okay? I should probably go. Yeah, you should. And there isn't gonna be another night. Gosh, Mom, you never let me do anything! Go upstairs, wash your face, put your pajamas on. And what if I don't?! Abbey! Not tonight! I know that she's going through a hard time, but she doesn't have to treat me like I'm five years old. Abbey, your mom loves you. Really? She's got a pretty messed up way of showing it. Did your mom treat you like this? I don't know my mom. Never met my dad. I was a foster kid. Oh... I'm so sorry. I didn't know. You have no idea how lucky you are that you have parents who love you. You're right. I know you're right. I don't love her, I do not want her. Okay. My turn. Can I tell you a secret? Of course. I would trade places with you in a heartbeat. Okay, enough about that. Let's go party. Wooo! Woo-woo! How old are you? Oh, honey, she's fine. Here's her ID. Ladies. Welcome to Club Secret Sins. Thank you. You aren't a cop and you don't have a search warrant. You don't even know who you're looking for. So you found an address on the web. So what? The dark web. And I traced the upload back to here. This is definitely the place where someone... they uploaded the videos and the list that... The membership list to the adult club. - Yeah. - Who cares? Can you help me or not? Why should I? What's in it for me? Nothing. Just helping an innocent guy get his life back. Come with me. All right, girl, let's go dance. Come on. Come on. Relax. Abbey! Do you want to get arrested? She's underage. Where's Isabelle? She... disappeared. Come on. See, I... I told you this was a waste of my time. Stop. Watch her. That's her. Mister, you just saved my marriage. I'm sorry. I should have listened. No. I'm sorry. I let you down. You grow up, you have children, and you're supposed to set an example. And then one day you just blow it all by making a complete fool out of yourself. You're not a fool. But I was. And I still can't explain how that happened. It's so not me. It'll never happen again. Ever. But you promise me that you will not go clubbing with Isabelle again. Don't worry. Besides, something's strange about Isabelle. What do you mean, strange? Well, she tried to kiss me. She what?! Mom, let it go. It was what she said that really bothered me. Tell me. She said that people used to call her fat... and ugly. What? She thought that no one was ever gonna love her. She wanted to kill herself. That's impossible. And then, on the way to the club... I would trade places with you in a heartbeat. Doesn't that, like, freak you out? She's this hot, single babe, and I'm this 17 year old nerd. Why would she want to trade places with me? Robert, I can't talk, I'm... I'm... I know it was you that uploaded the membership list and video. Why? For money? And what the hell's wrong with you? Can we just get together and talk about this calmly? You can talk to me or you'll talk to my lawyer. Robert, look, you, Morgan and I, we shared something special. What's your point? Just meet me in person. Okay? Let me explain. Meet me at my place, 30 minutes. Fifth and Riviera. We'll finish cleaning in the morning. I'm gonna go see Daddy. Are you sure you don't want me to go with you? I'm sure. You guys have got to get back together. I had a client with very deep pockets. I don't now. What's your explanation? That deal... would have saved my company, would have save my family, and saved my home. And because of you, I lost everything. I lost it all. You? I lost everything. I love you. Both of you, you and Morgan. We could have had the perfect life. Just the three of us. Mm. And Morgan is the only woman for me. You, you were something that we used one time for a little bit of fun. You mean nothing to us. No. No, you love me. You do, you love me. Morgan said that I was easy to love. She said I was... perfect. You're perfect. Get out of my house. I'm not going anywhere. Get some help. Ahh! Robert? Robert, it's me. Come on. I want to talk to you. Robert? Oh, my God. Robert, baby, what happened? Oh, my God. 9-1-1, what's your emergency? My husband. Please, send an ambulance, please. Tell me your location. Fifth and Riviera. He's unconscious. Please. Baby. Baby, wake up. Ma'am, hello? Are you there? Oh, my God. What... What happened? Mrs. DeAngelo, I'm Detective Erickson, this is my partner, Detective Barber. We'd, uh, like a word with you. Sure. I'll be right back, okay? This is good. Morgan, why would your husband call this woman, this friend of yours, what's her name? Isabelle. Isabelle. Why would he call Isabelle tonight? I don't know why he would call her. We've been separated for a while. - A while? - Hm. What were doing before you went to your husband's house? It's none of your business what I was doing. Ma'am, I'm afraid it is our business. Why was it that you and your husband separated? Was it because of Isabelle? Let me tell you something. My husband and I were high school sweethearts, and I love him. I would never hurt him. So if you think I put him here in the hospital, you're both sadly mistaken. I'm calling my lawyer. Good day. As I said, gentlemen, Robert was pursuing me because... well, I satisfy him. Apparently, something his wife can't do. He fell in love with me. Most men do. And his wife... Whoo. She was incredibly angry that he was still seeing me. I don't blame her. I mean, it wasn't his first time. You see, Robert is a sex addict. He just can't control himself. I guess Morgan just decided to... stop it. Once and for all. - Thank you. - Mm. I'm sorry to have bothered you. We're concerned Mr. DeAngelo's wife, Morgan, might have had something to do with it. It's impossible. I mean, sure, they argued like every married couple, but she's not a violent person. Not in the least. So you did see them arguing? Well, once. Do you know exactly what they were arguing about? I can't be a hundred percent sure, but I think that she thought he was having an affair. Thanks. We appreciate your time. Hey, Sandy, I really don't have time to talk right now. Look, I am so sorry to bother you. I just got done talking to the police. I think that they're going to arrest you. What?! Mrs. DeAngelo? Metro P.D. Open the door, please. We have a warrant for your arrest. Let's not make this more difficult than it has to be, ma'am. - You take the back. - Yeah. Good idea. Metro Police. Ma'am, are you in here? Metro Police. Miss DeAngelo! Are you home? Looks like nobody's here. Looks that way. All right, I'll call it in. Police are on the look out tonight for a Miami woman who was prominently featured in a video already viewed millions of times on social media. According to Metro detectives, Mrs. DeAngelo attacked her husband with a golf club after finding out he was having an affair. Right now, he's in the hospital in critical condition, but she's on the loose, and authorities are telling us she could be well armed. Knock-knock. I'm Jen Herrera, Channel 57 News. Abbey? Maybe. We need to ask you a few questions. My mom said I'm not supposed to speak without a lawyer present. It'll just be a minute. You have 59 seconds. You do understand that your mother is the primary suspect. No. Wrong. My mother would never do something like this. We're not saying your mom is a bad person, but sometimes good people make mistakes. Don't you agree? Now you're giving me a morality lesson? Forget this. Wait. Has your mother tried to contact you? - No. - If she does, you need to contact us immediately. - Abbey. - Abbey. Your mom is in deep trouble. Now, you may not believe this, but we are trying to help her. Abbey, she needs to come forward and make a statement. The longer she's out there avoiding the inevitable, the worse her case looks in the eyes of the court. We'll have one of our men, Officer Marquez, stationed right outside your father's room until we catch whoever did this. Oh. So he's supposed to, like, stop my mom from murdering my dad. Abbey, it's just a precaution. Why are you people ganging up on my mom? You should be out there trying to find out who actually did this! Isabelle? Hey, Abbey. What are you doing here? Oh, I... brought you cookies. I made them myself. How's he doing? How does it look like he's doing? Sorry. Not good. Doctor's aren't quite sure yet. You know, when I saw what happened on the news, I just couldn't believe it. Had to come visit him. Really? What were you doing with the IV? Oh... I was just making sure it was working okay. Look, I... I know he needs some rest, so I'm gonna go. Enjoy the cookies. Okay? So stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Come on, Dad. Hi. Excuse me. My cell phone's dead. ...DeAngelo attacked her husband with a golf club... Can I borrow yours for a second, please? I have to call my daughter. Okay. Thank you. I'll be right back. ...Channel 57 News. Hello? Honey. Hi, it's Mom. I had to call you from someone else's phone in case they're tracing mine. Are you okay? Uh, hi, Grandma. It's nice to hear your voice. Why are you calling me... Where are you? I'm at the hospital, Grandma, with Dad. There's a nice officer outside our door making sure we're safe. Got it. I know, I saw Mom on the TV too, Grandma. It's a total nightmare. How are you holding up? I'm okay. I need you to do me a favor, please. Can you go to your father's house and check his computer, his calendar, everything. I need to know what he was doing before he was attacked. I don't think that's gonna be necessary, Grandma. Hello? Come on, already. I'll be right out. Why? Isabelle stopped by. She brought a plate of cookies. Why would Isabelle bring a plate of cookies? And they're delicious. I think you should stop by her house to get the recipe. She'd be so surprised to see you. Got it. Okay. I'll call you later. Love you. Hello? Is everything okay? Chocolate chip? I lost one of my earrings. Is it okay if I go upstairs to see if it's up there? Babe, I went there to get a lost credit card, and those girls jumped me, okay? You know the kind of thing that happens at that place. Give him a taste of his own medicine. Okay, just one. It's like I was drugged or something. And I'd keep my distance from your little play pal there. I'm pretty sure that Isabelle had something to do with this. It was what she said that really bothered me. I would trade places with you in a heartbeat. You're not messing with my family anymore. Yeah, I need a flight. Tonight. Cancun, Mexico City. Doesn't matter. Oh, I need a hotel room, too. Indefinitely. What do you mean I need a return date? I said indefinitely. I'm gonna have to call you back. Isabelle. Help me. They're after me. I had to see you. They think I did it. They think I killed Robert. I know, it's all over the news. The thing is... I did. I did try to kill him. Because... he stopped loving me. No. No, he didn't. So I came by to say goodbye. Goodbye? Wh... Where are you going? Who cares. The beach, the woods. Anywhere where I can kill myself. No! Robert loves you. He told me. He said that you were the only woman for him. He said those words? Yeah. When? When I went over to his house to... Comfort him. He was so upset, I just... - Really? - Yeah. Because when I got there, he was already unconscious. Which must have been right after you tried to kill him. Look, I don't know what happened, okay? I just... I freaked out. I didn't mean to hurt him, it just... it just happened. Going somewhere? I'm gonna leave. And you're not going to call the cops, because if you do, I'm gonna tell them you came over here to kill me, too. And they're gonna believe me before they believe you. Really, bitch? I don't think so. I didn't mean to hurt him, it just... it just happened. That's you. I'm gonna share this with the cops. And they're gonna send you to a brand new private club. For many years. Hm? Gotcha. Ahh! You ruined it! What you need... is a little stretch. 9-1-1, please state your emergency. This is Morgan DeAngelo. I think you're looking for me. So you're married? Yes, miss, I am. Hm, that's nice. That's very nice. I'm so sorry. So, what do you think? As long as I have you, I love it. I don't need any more excitement in my life. Me, either. Let's take a picture. - Okay. - First day in our new home.
