In the void, pairs of particles are continuously created. Their only destiny is to meet and disappear into each other. When two particles that have interacted with each other are separated, they're no longer distinct particles. The same thing happens when two people fall in love. Even if life pulls them apart, they'll always carry some trace of the other person inside. Excellent time, Steve. Better than yesterday. Thanks, coach. We're not there yet. Roy. Keep this up, you won't make the team. Which means no meet in Rome for you, no college scholarship. What's going on? You stopped. What were you thinking? Nothing. No, no … - What? - It's none of your fucking business. So you can afford to throw this away? - What if I want to? - You don't need that scholarship? I already have a dad, I hate him. I don't need you! Everything you do here is my fucking business! So if you don't like that … Yeah, there's the door, go. Go! Come back when you wanna fucking swim! Steve, wait. You told him I'm single, and he didn't even react? I've never seen him with a girl. And he never goes out, even with the team. Maybe he's super brainy and spends all his time studying. Like Little Miss Physics here. He's hot as hell. And he's Italian too. - Would you really date a guy like that? - Thank you. I don't have to marry him. I'd be fine with a good one-night stand. Jesus, you're worse than a guy! There's this thing called equality, in case you hadn't noticed. Anyway, he's definitely a hothead. And he better watch his mouth too. Otherwise coach will never take him to Rome. - When's the meet? In two weeks. So you're finally bugging off and leaving me your girlfriend. - I'm gonna miss you, baby. - I'm gonna miss you too. I don't know who you are anymore since you've been with him. What is your problem? That Steve's a good guy? That he's not strange and mysterious enough for you? - I'm happy. - No, you're not happy, you're … like, serene. Which is totally different, it's terribly sad. Well, happiness in love is overrated! Wow, did I really just say that? - Yes! - I feel guilty. Well, you know, I hope the sex is at least … Sex is also overrated. That depends on who you do it with. - You're a fucking bitch. - Get in the motherfucking car! Ice cream, ice cream … - What up, dog? - … cherry on the top! Who's your best friend? I forgot. - Hey, monkey. - Hey! - Have you finished all your homework? - Yeah. Well … all except math. - You're gonna need math. - When? When I'm driving cross-country and you're in charge of groceries. - But I'm coming with you. - Yeah, we'll see about that. Come on. But why can't I come? - I gotta do it on my own. It's a growing experience. - Well, I'm all grown up. I could help you. - Really? How? I could tell you which road to take when you're driving. How about this? I'll bring you back a present from every city I go to. Okay? No. You wanna help? I have an idea. Set the table. Fine. - Thanks, kiddo. - You're welcome. Hey, kids. - Hi, Dad. - Sorry I couldn't get home sooner. It's okay, dinner's not ready yet. If I didn't get this guy's car fixed by tonight, he would have lost his shit. So, how did it go today? How'd it go? Okay. Time? - All right. - You don't win with "all right". - Your future depends on this. - I know. You remind me every day. Since O'Connor left, I'm working for two. Take your swimming seriously or come work for me at the garage. Did you ever think maybe I'm not good enough? - You wouldn't have gotten this far. - Yeah. - It's never enough for you. - No, it's never enough for you. You're setting the bar so high. - Roy! We're eating soon. - I'm not hungry. I wish you guys wouldn't fight so much. Me too. The repair guy said we have to replace the heating. It's broken again. Relax. I'll be home soon. I'll get it done. Daddy, please, help us! We can't live without you! I know. - By the way, Mom cooked tonight, can you believe it? Not even if I saw it! Come on, you two, I did a great job! Well, except for the vegetables. Hang in there, Viv. I'll be back in a couple of days. You ready for your test? I'm a little bit nervous. You just do the best you can. - Okay. I love you. - Love you too. Based on quantum physics, once particles that have spent some time together interact with their environment, they go back to being independent, separate, and apparently more distant from each other. The connection between these particles is so strong that the moment something happens to one of them, the other one feels it. Honey? Don't wait up for me tonight. I'm meeting with some clients. Okay. I was a dick last night. - Yeah. - I was gonna text you earlier. - But you didn't. - No. I really, really needed you last night. Like I needed you the night before that and the night before that. - I'm sorry. I was busy training. - But you're always busy! I'm always busy with quantum physics, and I still find time for you. I know. You're right, I just … I got the big meet coming up, and I'm under a lot of pressure. How about you? How's the prep coming along? Quantum physics is … fascinating and complicated and … so exhausting. You don't have to know everything before college, baby. - But enough to get in. I feel like … all I do is study, - and I'm still not ready. - I'm sure you are. Come here. - I'm a gangster, that's how I roll. - Explain to me what happened right now. What are you talking about? Where the fuck are my drugs? - Fuck off. - My drugs! What are you tripping over, man? - What the fuck is your problem? - Hey. - Looking for someone? - Uh … Uh, what? - That's a nice coat. - A rich bitch. That's a nice bag, huh? Uh-uh. Rich girl. - Over here. - You wanna play? Come on! Let's play a game! Catch it! - Just catch it. It's not that hard. - Don't get upset, we're just playing. - Grab his ass, girl. - We're just playing. - Give it back. - You don't need your bag, baby. - Don't hold it too long! - Play with us, baby! Give it back! - Leave her alone, bro! - You kept us waiting. How are you? How are you doing? Just having fun. I said, leave her alone. - We're just having fun. - Where is it? Here. Just take her bag. This is yours. Thank you. - Can I call you a ride? - No. I got it. Thanks. This is no place for girls like you. What do you mean, "girls like me"? You don't even know me. No. But I know your boyfriend. He wouldn't like you to be here. Well, can you just not tell him that you saw me here? Please? We're cool. You're early. Uh … what's up? What is the strongest thing you have? Oh, you're drinking now? - Tonight I drink. - Okay, then. Vodka? Straight from Ukraine. I think my dad brought it back the last time he went there. Uh … yeah, maybe not straight. Oh yeah … - It's so hard. Oh my God. - Give it here. I'm gonna get you some water with that. Wow, your place looks literally amazing. Thank you. I wanted to go for lights and mystery. Okay. What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. Roy, will you read me a story? One of those old ones, about animals? All right. But not too many questions. Or I'll turn off the lights, and no more fairy tales. - Okay? - Mm. "'The Cicada and the Ant'." The cicada sings in the sun. - "The ant works." - Did Mom ever read you stories? Of course she did. Well, did she ever read from this book? It wasn't the same book, but it was the same story. She used to read it when she was your age. "The cicada wants to play." 'I can't, ' says the ant. "'I need food for the winter.'" Do you miss her? I miss her as much as you do. But that's enough questions, okay? "The cicada wants to play." 'But I can't, ' says the ant. 'I need food for the winter.' 'But it's summer, ' says the cicada. 'Winter will come, and you will be hungry, ' says the ant. "But the cicada sings, and the ant carries more and more corn." No. No, that's not right. Too pink. - Too long. - So, what am I supposed to be? I think you should wear this one. It's a sexy cop outfit. - Isn't it too tight? - Yeah. That's the point. - I don't wanna be with her. - You sure? Maybe you're the one that's scared, huh? - How's it going with college? - I like it better here with you. - Wanna come over to my place later? - I can't, there's a big party. Everyone's going. The guys from my dorm. - I'm starting to like this. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - I don't see anything wrong with that. - You'll have to make up your mind, Steve. - Guess we'll have to find out tonight. So you are coming? Yeah, I might swing by. Okay, okay, okay. - Hey. - Yo. - How long have you been standing there? - A while. - How did you get in? The pool's closed. - I come here every night. Why? - You gotta train if you wanna be number one. - So, uh … - What did you see? - You don't wanna know, bro. - Don't worry about it. - Yeah, I … I don't wanna tell him that you break into the pool every night. You'd probably get kicked off the team. Big ordeal, right? What the fuck are you talking about? Nothing. I just don't wanna see you go down like that. You're a good swimmer. I want you on the team. We need you. So, are we good? You don't wanna be living in that trailer camp all your life, do you? You don't want the team to know you fuck the coach. Or is it just that pretty girl you're dating? You wanna lose that scholarship? Huh? Fuck up any chance you have? I fucking own you, man. I fucking own you, motherfucker! You do what I say or I'll fuck you up! You got that, goombah? You get the fuck out of here. Who are you? Show your hands! You stole my watch! Fuck you, motherfucker! - Give me my watch! - What the fuck, man? Back off! Adam, chill! - Get out! - Fuck you, motherfucker! - Take it easy, bro. - Fuck you. Give it here! Dick! - Hey! Fuck you! - Why are you fucking tripping? Wait a minute. - - Oh my God. Hey, hey! Come on. People are calling the cops. Let's go! Go! Why do you hang out with that guy? He's kind of a dick! I grew up with him. He did my tattoos. I'm stuck with them and with him. - At what age did you get your first tattoo? - I was 13, just a kid. Wow. My goodness. That must be … so … interesting, growing up in your neighborhood. What were you doing there? - It's a secret. - What, are you a kid? You have secrets? Um … Yes. How about we play a game? What kind of game? Mm, you tell me a secret and I'll tell you a secret. Sounds stupid. I don't have secrets, anyway. Wow. Really? You don't have one secret? Okay, well, I'll just go, you know, fuck off with all my honesty. You go first. I was supposed to take a test today. And I didn't. You go! Huh. Every night I go to the pool and train on my own. What's the point of training all night at a pool, if you're not on the team? What's the point in studying all day for a test you won't even take? Huh? - Touché. - What's to like about physics? It's so much simpler than actual life. I like numbers. - What's your favorite number? - Seven. Oh, wow. My goodness. You're bleeding. Really? I didn't notice. I'm gonna find you some ice. - I'll be right back. - Okay. So, they didn't have ice, but … - You're an early bird. - Early bird catches the worm, coach. If you say so. I stopped. Because I thought I'd already blown it. Has it ever happened to you? Time me! Can't believe it, can you? How did you do it? Same way you need to. No fear. Winning isn't just about talent. I know you come and train here in the night. I admire that. But it won't matter if you keep holding back. - Give me a chance. I'll prove I'm worth it. You gotta beat Steve. His best time. Then you'll put me on the team and take me to the meet? Show me you can do it first. I'm not gonna leave a winner behind. All right! Eight laps! Free style! Come on! Come on, come on … Good. I wanna see those flip turns! Come on. Steve, Roy! Get on the blocks! Time trial! This is all out! Ready! That's what I meant. Two tenths off the team record. - Really? - You did good. Ah! Whew. - Where the fuck were you last night? - Where the fuck was I? Where were you? I called you at least a hundred times. I was at practice. Don't you trust me anymore? - Right now I don't really trust anyone. What's wrong with you? Lately it's like you're always somewhere else. Did you even notice I just lost my race? Did you even think to ask about my test yesterday? I forgot. Of course you did! How did it go? It went like fucking shit, Steve. But you wouldn't know, because you never have time for me anymore. Listen, I'm sorry about your test. And I'm sorry about last night, okay? Can we let it go and fucking move on? That's all you ever wanna do. Look, if you don't fight right now, Steve, for me and us, our relationship, then that's it. Then I'm done. - Yo, Roy, are you coming with us, dude? - Yeah, man. I have to go talk to coach. You beat him, bro! You beat him! Great, awesome! It's not easy for me, okay? It's not easy for me either. It's not for much longer. - What are you guys talking about? - Hey. Honey. So good to see you. Oh, how did the test go? - I don't wanna talk about it. - Come on, kiddo. I know it's important for you. But if you failed, it's not a big deal, right? What do you mean? She studied the whole year for this test. - Do you know how hard it is? - Do you know how hard it is, Mom? I've been spending my whole life thinking about numbers. And I get there, and all I can think about is you, fucking your new boyfriend. Viv. We've decided to take a break. What? For how long? It's been a year. We wanted to wait for you to take the test and go off to college and … You've been lying to me for a year? Is this why you're traveling so much lately? Because … because you … you're hiding it from me? Viv, I'm so sorry. So you're both liars. Okay. Okay, good to know. Viv, wait! Hello. - Hello. - Um … My boyfriend went out and, uh, took his key with him, and … I forgot something in his room. If I could grab an extra key, - that would be great. - His name and room number, please? Steve Miller. And … Damn, I forgot the room number. Jet lag, you know. It also looks like you forgot to leave your bags inside. Shall we blame jet lag for that too? I'm afraid there's nothing I can do. I'm really sorry. Look, I have been flying all day. I really wanna surprise my boyfriend, and just go say hi before I leave. - Steve Miller, you said, right? - Yeah. I can walk you up to his room. If he knows you and confirms your story, then I guess you won't be a problem. Thank you. Thank you. After you. - Hey. - Oh, uh … hi. - What are you doing here? - Is he your boyfriend? Yes! Hi! Hi. Babe, surprise! Uh … - Hello. Okay. Here's the key. Have a pleasant stay. And watch out for that jet lag. Thank you so much for all the help. Oh! Thank you for playing along with that. I'm sorry. I've been trying to surprise Steve, and he wasn't gonna let me up. Yeah, anyway … Where is Steve's room? Steve's room is … 511. Yeah, just … Down the hall? - Yeah. - Okay. - I'll just keep following you then. - Um, I left something inside. - Okay. - I'll see you later. Okay? Uh … Thanks again for playing along with that. Oh, it's … it's fine. Surp… - Everything okay? - Yeah. Do you know where Steve is? He was at practice this morning, but I don't know where he went. Wanna go for a walk? I know some really dope places. It depends. Depends on what? If you're going to dump me as soon as I'm getting you ice, which I think is very nice. - Yes. Uh … About that … I think I can make it up to you. I'm sure. Come on! We can have some fun. Okay. I'm so excited to see all the photos you've taken from today. - Did you get any good ones of me? - I hardly ever take pictures of people. So I've been posing this entire time, and you don't have one photo of me? I take pictures of places I find interesting. So, is it just people you don't find interesting, or is it just me? No, I do. I just don't need pictures to prove it. It's not about proving anything. It's about keeping the people you love close to you at all times. People I love are always with me. I keep them inside. Okay, but your brain can't store all your memories since you were born. Thank God. So, how are you supposed to remember this amazing day we've spent together? Who says I wanna remember it, huh? - Oh! - Can you please move out of the frame? - Hey! Stop it! What are you doing? - Got you! It's mine! Can't catch me! Hey! Should we go … um … Should we walk around it? How long did you live here for? Till the end of middle school. Then my dad wanted to move back to the States. But didn't you wanna stay here? Yes. No. It's a long story. You don't wanna hear it. How about you climb up the steps and look back only when I tell you? Why? - Just trust me. - Why would I trust you? I'll tell you a story about trust my mom used to tell me. A long time ago, there was this guy. His name was Orpheus. He was madly in love with this beautiful nymph, Eurydice. She's hot, like, she's fire. But one day she dies. What? - So he makes a deal with the king of the underworld. - What kind of deal? - He can bring her back to life. On one condition. On their way out he can't look at her, can't turn around. She's behind him the whole time. She knows nothing about his deal. So, what, she starts talking to him? Much worse. She keeps calling out his name. "Orpheus. Orpheus." Now close your eyes. Where are you taking me? Out of the underworld. … I need you, baby To warm the lonely nights I love you, baby Trust in me when I say Oh pretty baby … Okay, there is a step now, there is a step! One. Another step. Yes. Okay. Now you can open your eyes. So, you never even told me how the story ends. What story? Orpheus. Oh. Yeah, right at the end Eurydice falls silent, so he turns around and looks. - And what happens to her? - She's gone. - Greek mythology is fucked up! - No. That's love. Life pulls people apart, and love ends. It can't last forever. You are such a pessimist. But I'm a numbers girl, so I kind of respect it. What's math got to do with love? Well, there's all these numbers that surround the word "love", and it used to make so much sense to me, and I … Now I'm not so sure. Do you believe in love? Yes, I do. I just don't want it. Do you mind calling Steve again, and … seeing if he answers this time? - Sure. He's not answering. Wanna grab a drink? I owe you one. So, why are obtuse angles so depressed? - Why? - Because … they're never right. You get it, right? I got it. - Why aren't you laughing? He doesn't love, he doesn't laugh … That's the funniest thing you've done today! - I'm so sorry. - No worries. - I'm such a klutz when I drink. - Two more margaritas please. - Are you guests at our hotel? Oh yes. Room 222. - What if she finds out? - I have a plan. - Thank you! I'm sorry, again, by the way. - Okay. - Cheers. - Cheers! Change of location without attracting attention. - That's worse! - I feel like this is really stealthy! You're the devil, making me drink the day before the meet. I'm not making you do anything you wouldn't be doing. - Not sure about that. - Are you nervous about the meet? Why should I be? I'm not gonna win it. - But you won last time. - Winning one time trial is no big deal. Everybody gets lucky sometimes. Wow. Are you always so supportive of yourself? Only when you're around. So, what are you gonna do if you win? If I do win, my dad's gonna find another reason to give me shit. What about your mom? I'm asking because mine lately … Mine is dead. - I'm so sorry, Roy. - It's okay. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to … - It's okay. It was a long time ago. Actually, she taught me how to swim. Can I ask how it happened? We were on vacation, and my dad and my sister went for a walk. My mom was swimming in the sea. Something went wrong. She must have blacked out. She couldn't get back to shore. I tried to get to her. I tried. And I failed. I'm so sorry. 222 is empty. What's happening? - They're skipping out. - Escape! - Go, go, go! - Stop them! Come on, come on! Ah! YOLO. Right? Turn around! Did you really say "YOLO"? Whatever! You only live once. If there was ever a time to use it … … now would be the time. Did you know that chlorine is the main … We should go, before we get in trouble. So … I … I guess it's good night. Yeah. I had fun. Um … I … I did too. - Night. - Good night. Baby … It's not what it looks like. What … - I can explain. Uh … Viv! Did you know? Viv! - - Viv! Wait! Leave me alone! - Leave me alone, Roy. Seriously! - Vivien! Vivien. Fuck you! - Please stop. Please. - I don't wanna talk to you. - Leave me alone. You get it? - Please, calm down. Why didn't you tell me? - Calm down! - Why didn't you tell me? What was I supposed to do? You were supposed to tell me the truth! What do you think? Were you trying to use this to your advantage? What was that? Like, you … We go out, we get drunk, and then you kiss me? - What was that about? - Oh, come on! You wanted the kiss as bad as me! You wanted it! Is it my fucking fault if your boyfriend cheats on you? If you find out? Is it? And that whole story about trust? I could never trust someone like you! Did you think after you kissed me, we would just be "happily ever after"? I could never be with someone like you. Someone who tries and fails! Oh … Fuck. Roy! - Roy! - Fuck off! Hey, I'm sorry! I didn't mean that, okay? I didn't wanna say that, I'm sorry. Vivien! - How did they get her back here? - Luckily she was stable, so they could put her on a plane. The doctors in Rome okayed it. How come you guys weren't together? - The meet was the next day. I couldn't go out. Yeah, but Roy was out with Vivien, so where were you? What happened that night? I don't know. I can't figure out why they were together. Did you have a fight or … - We had dinner. I was tired and focused on the meet. I went to bed early. I should have been there. I should have been there. Unfortunately she suffered a serious concussion. But the good news is that her CAT scan shows no cerebral lesions or focal neurological signs. And she's got no significant injuries. - So we can hope she'll wake up? - Of course. She's young and strong. How long will it take? I'm afraid I don't have the answer to that. All we can do is continue to monitor her condition. Let's be optimistic. We'll get through this. Okay? Well, hand me a 13. I said 13, this is an 18. No, don't worry, I got it. Let's take a break. I've been going at this for three hours. Go get two beers. Coach passed by yesterday. He said he hasn't seen you in a while. You really wanna quit? The team won anyway. They don't need me. Why fight for something that's gonna get me nowhere? All right, listen. This goes against my own interests, because since you've been helping out, work's gotten a lot easier. But shouldn't you think this over? You gotta be kidding me. You beg me for years to help you in the shop, and now I'm here, you tell me to think it over? You're fucking crazy. I don't want you to rush this decision. I told you, Dad, I'm done. Roy! How's the girl doing? She's stable. But she's lost somewhere. I'll finish up. Go and get out of here. - Visiting times are over. - I know. - So why do you always come so late? - I got a job. Is she your girlfriend? Five minutes. She's not my girlfriend. You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you You'd be like heaven to touch I wanna hold you so much At long last love has arrived And I thank God I'm alive You're just too good to be true I can't take my eyes off of you I love you, baby And if it's quite all right I need you, baby To warm the lonely night … Vivien? How are you feeling? Can you hear me? Can you please follow my finger? Good. Do you remember anything about that night? I mean, the night of the accident. I … don't remember, um … anything. You went to see your boyfriend Steve. Do you know who Steve is? - Yes. I know who Steve is. - Okay. Um, could you please draw two triangles with the same base? Kind of wonky. Thank you, Vivien. Will I be the same me as I was b… before everything? Well, you're making great progress, and we think you're gonna be fine. But it may take a little time. So you'll need to be patient, okay? Okay. Vivien is doing fine. However, as we suspected there's a gap in her short-term memory. This is pretty common in patients who experienced this kind of trauma. We'll need to take some precautions in dealing with her condition. - What kind? Let her rest. Don't try to force her to remember what happened. And don't worry if she seems confused when she talks about it. Just … let her work it through. Take her home. She's doing well. We all are. How are you feeling? Better. - Mm? - Yeah. - I feel … I'm feeling good. Yeah. - Yeah? So, fill me in. Did you see anything or feel … anything? When I woke up, I felt, um … like, a presence. The brain's so weird. - Yeah. - A crazy place. - Here you go, baby. - Hey. - For you. - Thanks. Did you take photos of us that night? - Right? With a Polaroid camera. - Yeah. But … I left them at the hotel. Everything got so crazy so fast, I just forgot them in the room. Really? Because I … That's too bad. Look, I found one. Oh, yeah. It's cute. Yeah. This is, um … You know, that night, um … I was so afraid that I'd lose a lot more than just those pictures. - I missed you. - Mm … I missed you too. Hey, who are you? Want a beer? You're real hot, you know that? - What's a princess doing in this shit place? - I'm looking for Roy. Do you know him? Over there. He always gets the hotties. Come see me later! What do you want? Did you take any Polaroids of Vivien the day of the accident? Yes. Why? And was one of those a picture of her in a park? Yes. Why are you asking? She woke up, Roy. How's she doing? Is she home? Yeah, but … she's remembering a bunch of strange stuff, and … She's convinced she was with Steve that night. And he's telling the same story. - Did you tell her anything? - No. - She was already upset. - So don't. Wait. You're giving up on her just like that? - It's best for everyone. - Are you scared of how she'll take it? No. - Don't tell me you're trying to protect Steve. - Fuck Steve! Well, then why? Because I almost killed her. Every time I get close to someone, it ends in disaster. I get there too late. But this time, I can go away before I fuck it up. What happened between you that night? It's complicated. - But something happened. - Yes. And it shouldn't have. What's wrong? She woke up. What did I tell you? Just a matter of time. Roy. It wasn't your fault. I'll never forgive myself. I'm the one you have to forgive. It's like I drowned with her that day. I tried to forget, but I can't. I, too, was afraid of moving on. Of standing around while you're stuck with the guilt that's not yours to bear! I'm sorry. You have to make up your mind. Okay? Don't be the fuck-up I've been. This is what I'm trying to tell you. Come here. I tried to get her all shiny and new, but then you just showed up. Take the other side. She's yours. If it breaks, you fix it. You can go now. How are you gonna manage without me? Let's just say, uh … your relationship with wrenches has forced me to let you go. So I'm fired? Yeah. Go hit the road. Let's go. - Come on, bro! - Can't seem to open it. Fuck, yeah! - Thank you, man. - Got your back. Thank you, sweetie. - Not too much. - Why not? Well, I may be tempted to take advantage of you. - I dare you. - Watch me. - What are you eating? - Mm … Fish. Oysters. Guys, you can stop pretending. What are you talking about? I … know. I … I remember. You don't have to pretend for me. We're not pretending. I mean, we had decided to separate, that's true, but … after your accident, we got close again. And we realized that we still need each other. - Really? - Yeah. We need someone in the kitchen. Thank you. Really? Yes. Honey. Wow. Oh, thank God. No, no, no … Hi, baby. This is so sweet. Oh my goodness, I love this surprise! Steve, seriously, thank you so much! So romantic! Baby, let me love you I thought no one was here. What's going on? With everything that happened, I, uh … realized I needed a break. Why? - I've been struggling. - Struggling with what? Struggling with seeing you every day. Okay? I can't do it anymore. What about the team? New coach is coming tomorrow. I hate goodbyes. So you were just gonna disappear without saying goodbye? Goodbye. You can't just quit! You can't just leave like this. Who am I quitting on, Steve? The team? Or you? Yeah … - Hey, baby. - Hey. What are you up to? Were we together the day of the accident? Yeah, of course. I told you. Why are you asking? Because my brain is not as reliable as it used to be. So … I feel like I need clarification on a couple things. - Okay. - What's happening in this photo? That's a, um … fountain in a square. Obviously it's a fountain in a square. But what is it actually a picture of? Where are we? - Why are you being so hostile? - I'm not. I'm just asking questions. How did we spend that day? Uh, we … went for a walk and had dinner. Where did we have dinner? We went to a restaurant. Was there a terrace there? Yeah. There was, Viv. What was I wearing? Um … I can't remember, I don't … Are you serious? The day I almost died, you can't remember what I was wearing? Are you serious? Why are we not in any of these pictures? Not in one of them! Where's any photos of us? Where's your camera even? I told you, I left everything at the hotel. This is crazy, baby, I … If you left everything at the hotel, then how did all these get here? Where did these come from, then? You weren't with me! - Yes, I was. - No, you weren't! You were not with me! So, where were you then? - Why are you lying? - I'm not. Why are you lying to me right now? You're driving me crazy! This is already so hard. And you're making it so much harder. Why are you lying? Why? Where were you that night? Where … - I was with Dylan, okay? Okay? In Rome, the night of the party, for the past three months and twelve days … I was with him, okay? Trust what you feel. Love doesn't need to be proven. Keep walking, don't turn around, and go on. Orpheus. I'll be waiting. 401 Edgar Road … - Hey. - Hey. This is pretty. Yeah? You … you like it? Mm-hmm. Can I take your jacket? I missed you. It was you. When I woke up. Yes. - Why didn't you tell me? - I did. In my own way. I've been thinking about that kiss every second of every day since it happened. And a lot of things … Bad things happened after that kiss. Should we take the risk again? The bond between two particles that have interacted is only valid in the microscopic realm. It cannot be applied to the human world, because human beings are much more complicated and … unpredictable. Subtitles: Ulrike Nolte FFS-Subtitling GmbH Creative Supervisor: D. Mark Skibo
