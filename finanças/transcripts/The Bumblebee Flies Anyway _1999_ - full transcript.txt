Subtitles created by: @Nell.aja Barney, you're going in now. Room nine. You've been unconscious for a long time, so you're probably a little groggy. It's normal. We agreed not to talk about your past before we started the experiment. But I'm Barney Snow, right? Will I always remember it? If you forget, I'll remind you. That's a big vote of confidence in someone, I don't know. You must trust yourself and your decision to participate. The research is important. I would ask you to think of the hospital as your temporary home. You can move freely in the area. Come to me if you have any questions. But it is a phase I hospital. The patients are terminally ill. - Apart from me? - Yes. When you are around the patients, you must not get attached to them. - Are the others lost? - No, but they cannot be cured. Well. - How about you? - If I'm sick? Are you also able to opt-out? It is important for the research to maintain a friendly distance. Maintain? A job for a Handyman. ...That is what I mean. You can get lost in here. But you don't have to pay extra for the tour. Turn right, the last door is on the left. You're the normal one who won't die, right? - Well, I guess I am. - Follow me. The palace. Mazzo is spoiled. Now he has got a Walkman phone. The mother calls him all the time. I would adopt her if I got one. - Handyman can give you one. - Who? - The doctor. - Her name is Harriman. She is new. The hospital can't afford that kind of thing. Mazzo's family is filthy rich. Who do you want to call? In the previous place, I had a telephone. I called the local radio station. And said I was terminally ill. The radio host was admittedly friendly. When I asked to hear "Lick My Love Pump", commercials came on. Block Major! You threw the ball into Mazzo. So what, Mazzo? Excuse me for interrupting. The ball rolled under your bed. Barney, come get your ball. Mazzo has got a new phone. It's super cool! - Throw that idiot out! - He's not an idiot. - It's not him I'm referring to. - Mazzo, this is Barney. - Barney is not dying. - Then he has nothing to do here. Out! Calling Barney Snow... The ball is in the potty. - Sorry to interrupt. - Don't let it happen again. - Who is the guy with the mask? - Dr. Croft. He leads the research. - And you are envious of him. - Do I detect a certain cynicism? Relax. He is sleeping now. Let's get started, folks. The bumble bee experiment on November 14, at 11. Dr. Croft, Dr. Harriman and Bernard Snow is present. When I say a word, you must respond. Can you do that? - Snow. - Me. - Mother. - Family. Car. Hill. - Hill. - Proud. Spot shot! Spot shot! One more and he's out. You're out! - What are you hospitalized for? - You mean what I die of? I never saw my parents, but they still gave me shit. It is a genetic disease that destroys the kidneys. Crazy, right? - I am sorry. - Why? Is it your fault? If so, you will be beaten! - Who is it? - Allie is crazy. Something about the brain. - Isn't it dangerous to sit there? - He falls and kills himself. I drove the wrong way in a red car with a hood. A lady was standing on the road. Well. Clinging to the memories. So the experiment works? Yes. It works. I'm busy. We'll talk about that later. Is the woman unharmed? - I think I know her! - You must not be in here. You don't benefit from seeing it. But that's how we work. Are you able to do it? - Billy told me about it. - What did he say? - That you wanted to "roast" Johnson. - It's not that simple now. He is involved in an experiment which will test the use of microwaves - for combating cancerous tumors. - Does the treatment make him well? - You probably know the answer well. How can you stand it? Don't ask me that. I'm Barney Snow I was in a car accident I can't remember my name so I won't save it here. You'll be in trouble if they find you, Billy. What will they do? Kill me? Handyman said, "Don't get involved" and you bought it, you fool. Stay inside yourself. Think you're the only one with feelings? Stay away from the sick children. Maybe you get infected. Listen here, Nyresen. I will not apologize that I am not dying. If you think so, forget it. I stay away until I get out. Cool plan... Iceman! Yes. You are a real iceman. It's too cold for me here. I am leaving. - I taped it to your toe. - Why right there? For hygienic reasons, the bandage must be changed regularly. "I'm Barney Snow. I was in a traffic accident. Red". - Don't fear the process. - It's my life. I don't remember anything. What if the flap goes down every time I get dirty? - Dirty? - The medicine. I want to remember a bit of the past before you sweep it all away. I would like to help you. That's my job. Pardon. But the uncertainty is scary. - I understand. - I am left to myself. If you understood me, you would not be unaffected. I will give you a simple sample. You're happy about that, aren't you? Ma... Mazzo! Step, Allie. Come on in. I want to talk to you. I have a suggestion. Billy wants to borrow the phone. What does that have to do with me? Every afternoon at 14 I am for treatment in the basement. I'm gone for an hour. You must use the phone while I'm gone. But no out-of-town calls and no sex lines. And only for two weeks. Why are you telling me that? A letter from my holy sister. She is coming to visit today. She hopes my mother can hold my hand when I die. - She comes in vain. - Does she live far from here? At a Catholic school in Italy. She dreams of becoming a saint. She comes at 15 and you must accept her. - Maybe she wants to be alone with you. - It is my needs that count. - Billy is your friend, right? - I have no friends here. He is dying. It means a lot to him to call. Billy, now you just have to... listen. Do not worry. The doctor just looked at him. Nyreman, the Iceman has obtained a telephone. Here we go. Have you got a new hairstyle? - You look good, Berto. - I'm dying, damn it. This is my friend Barney Snow. Barney, my little sister Cassie. - Are you still naughty? - What do you mean? Whenever he is in trouble, he hides behind a cushion. Once he smashed Dad's Porsche. He brought a guy home from the emergency room. His "bumper". The Porsche was a cool push. Like the Jaguar. You smashed that too. It was lucky you weren't killed. Lucky? It must not end like this. I should have destroyed myself. Better to die happy then end my days here. - You are not alone, Berto. - Has your mother given you a sacred task? It's not a conspiracy. Mom loves you. And I love you. Just go. - It was nice meeting you. - You too. Why aren't you inside? Maybe you'll get a visit. Are you getting visitors? Are you an orphan? Wait here. - Cassie! How is Mazzo? - He doesn't want to know about me. It hasn't always been that way. Did you know we were twins? I know we don't look alike. I envy you because you can talk. You must give him more time. Maybe I lack your ability to make friends. - We might see each other again. - Yes, please. Shelter... Something wrong? Nice ass. You are gay. You get horny watching me sleep. - Which gay would turn you on? - Step! Then I'll feel better. It is a sign of health. Can I do something for you? Yes. Step! Why do you keep playing with that ball? It takes my mind off my miserable life. I thought you had forgotten. - Who told you that? - Miss Bascam. Did you ask her? There I got you! You show care. - Get lost! - Scrub yourself off! You feel pity! Half a year ago, I could smash you with one hand. You fucking underdog, now you pity me. Get lost. Now! I do not understand it. I feel like I'm thinking more clearly. The fog is lifting, as you said. But I don't know where I am. I remember my name, the accident. Nothing. Why is that so? Once you remembered less. Consider it a fresh start. Where is my family? I want to meet them! - Shall I get a glass of water? - You are no help! My memory is blank. I am surrounded by dying people. We have another test on Monday. It will soon be over. - And if I let myself be influenced? - We have been through that. Thanks. Wait a minute. Talking to you is a waste of time. You are completely unaffected. You don't understand what it's like because you can't feel it. Cross your fingers for me. Barney, you have guests. Is it true that you live in a monastery? I don't want to be a nun. I just need to be alone. - What is Mazzo's experiment about? - He has a rare bone cancer. - It must be hard for you. - Do you have siblings? I never wondered about that. Have no idea. Barney, talk to Berto. He needs a friend. - He is not exactly friendly. - I know he likes you. - A twin's intuition? - Something like that. Berto longs for life, adventure and friends. His anger only makes his last days more lonely. Well, Mr. Mazzo... Now we're off to drive... You are raving insane. It makes sense. I'm sure I lost my memory in an accident. - There must be some scars. - Whoa! Shouldn't I wear gloves? Keep looking. We are doing the test now. It is risky to carry out the experiment. We should pique his curiosity to remember harmless things. In my eyes, curiosity is deadly. Maybe, but we owe him some memory. Tell me about your mother. There she is. - Her name? - Eileen. Right. - She loves Me. - Yes. She gives you security. You remember her very clearly. You only have good memories of her. Hey Baby. I'm looking for the number of a certain Snow. Like in a blizzard. - Where? - Here Monument. First name? Eileen. And the address is...? Thank you beautiful. You better go again. - Why are you in a wheelchair? - Then I don't have to go. Mazzo is doing well, although he is a little pale. You're not helping me by lying, Barney. He is frail and weak... He is lying in a drop. I think he's gotten worse. I am sorry. I came to hear the truth. Why doesn't he want to know from you? He has never forgiven his mother for allowing herself to be divorced. He blames her because he knows it hurts her. What about you? If the mirror showed you as you once were, - -did you dare look into it? - Did you see the brain scan this morning? - Yes. It looks good. We'll be done soon. It's great, isn't it? Yes, but we have gone too far. What is most important? The experiment or the boy? The question is rather. Why is he more important than another boy, - - which we can cure with this form of treatment? Are you feeling well? Yes. What about you? Life is a deadly disease, as they say. Did it work? Do you remember anything? You were up there for two days. - What day is it? Time? - Thursday. 13.50. - Where are you going? - I have to meet my mother. Are you coming back? Barney! My mother is reserved or cold if you ask Berto. My father is the typical warm-blooded Italian who knows how to make money. Their marriage was a mistake. It's like the poem "Fire & Ice". - What is strongest? - What do you mean yourself? Ice. Father's fire went out with time, but Mother's ice remained. They have been divorced for many years, but… - What? - I waffle. Bad habit. I like it when you waffle. It was a natural reaction on Barney's part. It is to your credit that he experimented. I deserve no honors. If Barney stopped seeking the truth, he would be lost. Yes, but if he finds it, he loses everything. - Will you keep an eye on him? - I'll call when he's back. Barney? Good luck. Excuse me... Father - Richard Pierce Snow born: 2/25/1948 died: 7/26/1983 I'm looking for Eileen Snow. Mother - Eileen Duval Snow Born, 8/30, 1049 - Eileen? - Yes. Died: 9/25/1988 The bumble bee project It may have been a wrong Snow. Maybe your mother is still alive. - Remember it. - You're right. Even to that extent! Welcome home. Came. I'll give it a go. Hey, Billy. What are you doing? Are you expecting a visit? No. - I've had a quiet day. And you? - Would you mind? Barney is coming back. He does. Are you referring to being swayed? I should never have said that. You should know one thing... I admire you. All the studies you apply for. It must be very painful, but I admire your courage. I respect you. You have a backbone. Here you go. You listen to more music than I do. Don't stay out here too long. Otherwise, you just freeze. So what, Cassie? Hi Mike. You look damn good. Where have you been all summer? The beach is not the same without you. Do you want to go to a pub? No. It's Barney Snow. - You're not here from the city, are you? - Me and Cassie are passing through. How is Mazzo? It's a worse mess. I hear they amputated his leg. - What? - The bone cancer. It's really hard. - Piss and paper! - Mazzo is fine. - Is he getting better? - At least he doesn't crumble. Should I visit him with the boys? - He will be delighted. - What? He is my best friend? - You feel sorry for him. - Yes, deep pity. We better go now. My regards Mazzo from you. We share a living room. Tell me what you know. - What do I know? - What you can remember clearly. I'm Barney Snow... I drove the wrong way in a red car with a hood. I remember Cassie. It is a memory from the present. Stay in the present. You don't need anything else. Your past is over. The future will take care of itself. End final! You better go now. Cool fight. Do you want me to go? Why did you agree to be admitted here? To be able to die faster. If the experiment went wrong they would probably kill me. What feels the longest? The days or the nights? - Can not you Sleep? - I have nightmares. It began as a memory. It was amazing. But now it torments me. What? I'm sitting in a car... A red car with a hood. I'm driving, but I'm not in control of the car. - Which car brand? - I do not know. Tell us how it feels to sit there behind the wheel at full speed. A sticky feeling. My hands are glued to the steering wheel. Do you drive with the nail in the bottom? How does your body react? I am part of the car. I'm driving down a hill at far too high a speed. I spot a woman. She steps out into the street 100 m further on. I'm racing out there. Faster and faster. I brake, but the car does not start. The car speeds away and I wake up. I don't hear her scream. I only see her face in my mind. I would give anything to have another chance. Getting behind the wheel again. So that life can have its proper ending. - Unplug, Barney. - You mustn't ask me that. I want to die. Most of me is already dead. I can not. Do you want to steal a car? Coolest! I've tried that before. - Have you stolen cars? - I stole 25 before I got sick. I kept track of them. Toyota was the Red Sox, - - Chrysler was the Yankees, Ford was Philadelphia... You've probably made a fortune stealing toy cars. - When do we shake off half the brain? - No one cares about you. - We take a shortcut to the basement. - Is there something I haven't understood? - Do you want to steal a car? - Yes. Isn't a parking lot a more obvious place? - I don't steal a car. - What are you doing? I want to build one from old spare parts. You will need a professional. I pass the time playing ball while I wait to get the dirt. It's medicine, not crap. If I build a car, the memories might come back. Allie can play in it as if it were a merry-go-round car. If you help me, we can all use it. - Maybe even Mazzo. - Did you come up with it at night? We must have a place that is our own. Berto! Is he dying, Barney? There is something wrong. They have forbidden me to see him. - Do you know what he's doing wrong? - I'll get the doctor. No. Go to Berto. Would you please? So, so. It will be OK. Barney, go back to the living room. - Can he handle it? - Yes. Go now. Cassie, he made it. I know. Berto was born 58 seconds before me. He calls me a little sister. We have shared everything growing up: Measles, colds... But I knew there was more under the sun… A few years ago, at Thanksgiving… Berto was out with his friends and I was sleeping. I felt a pain in my left arm… A sharp pain. I threw up in the middle. I woke up with a fever. In the bath, I noticed the bruises. I went down into the living room and met Berto... He had his left arm in a bandage. He had gone wrong on a motorcycle with a friend. My Goodness! Did you tell him? I was aware of the connection shortly after Berto was diagnosed with cancer. I never told him that… I've never told anyone... until now. I am so afraid! Billy! Just give me a hand. George! Handy... handyman! Live in the moment, live in the moment, Barney. It hurts me, Barney. It hurts me. Your case has been named the Humlebi project. A bumble bee should not be able to fly. Its wingspan is too small. Still, it flies. There are several theories about the phenomenon, but the most important one is Willpower. The bee does not know that the impossible becomes possible. In your case we used drugs, hypnosis and the nightmare - - to build a wall around your long-term memory. I know it's hard, but I have to tell you. We wanted to hide your past so you could create your future. Unfortunately, your entire past was erased. Prof. Croft let you post here - - and I have tried to awaken your childhood memories. You were fully aware of the circumstances and your background - - when you signed up for the project. - Who am I? - Barney Snow. - Where is my family? - You are an only child. Your father died when you were two years old. Your mother was killed when you were seven. You have lived with three different foster parents. It didn't work. Your memory of your mother's death was the background of the memory wall. - Behind the wall. - It will get even worse. When Professor Croft visited you, you were in a youth hospital for the dying. - Why? - You had bone cancer. You were on the mend, so you were perfect for the project. You were under anesthesia while we operated, and your symptoms gradually disappeared. You woke up here, safe and sound. A healthy NN. When Croft hears about this, he sees two possibilities. 1. The project is discontinued. If you relapse, the disease runs its course. 2. We try again and you forget everything you've heard. - Give me another alternative. - I wish I could. - What are you up to now? - How are you feeling? How do you think I feel? - The nights... - What? The nights are the hardest. You will soon come home to your teddy bear. Should I get the nurse? You haven't seen me when I'm sick. Go away. You don't belong here. Mazzo... Yes, I do. You lied to us, you satan. No. The doctors lied to me. The experiments with memory manipulation of cancer. If you had to let go of your past for a future… ...would you do it? I have done that... This is my life. But the memories emerge. Good memories. Reminds me of my mother when I was little. But a new nightmare has appeared... About a time not so long ago when I was in your place. Come here. - You don't need to knock. - It brings luck. Come in, Barney. Take a seat. Until recently, my cancer research didn't count for anything. But my technique makes it possible to remove those signals, - the brain sends to the cancer cells, which cause the tumor to grow. By erasing your past, I have severed the connection between Mind and body, which fed your cancer. It can be compared to dubbing a videotape - to delete an unwanted program. You have deleted my favorite show. Three months ago you were dying and haunted by the past. I didn't know the alternatives. I'm sorry. So am I. You guys are done if I don't agree to try again? Yes. We cannot proceed without your permission. Do you believe it will succeed? I believe the professor's work will be able to benefit several patients. But...? But the loss of the person's identity is a big cost. Now listen here... If you help us, we can achieve better research results. One fine day we can isolate the thoughts that feed the disease. We can then produce a medicine that only changes part of the identity. - It could save lives. - I need time to think. For your own sake, we should resume treatment as soon as possible. You will have one day to think about it. Then you will be moved - - to a new research center or back to the hospital. - It's almost finished. - Yes, now we just need... What's up, Barney? After effects... from the medicine. Cassie... are you okay? Where have you been? What do you look like? Let's go for a walk. There is something I want to tell you. I'm going back to Italy. It was wrong of me to come. It benefits neither me nor Berto. - When do you leave? - The day after tomorrow. Try to understand. I don't know how I will react when Berto dies. Although I was hazy, I remembered you clearly. Only you. Cassie, you have to promise me one thing. If at some point I have forgotten about us, please remind me. I promise. - Are you going back to the monastery? - Yes. Well. God must have missed you. At least Barney will miss you. Barney... I know you've been keeping an eye on Cassie. That's how she is now. She always has to do things for me. It's not your fault, Cassie. You can't control my disease, so drop it. I pull her into the fall. It must not happen. Say goodbye nicely and go with you. At least one of us deserved to have a good life. - I better go... - No! - Do you never sleep? - You shouldn't have talked. - What have you done? - I've done my rounds. - Why are you here, Billy? - The neighborhood appeals to me. - Neighborhoods consist of houses. - There is not that much fart here. I will not be forwarded to new foster parents. I have my room. No fake siblings. No family dog ​​that says, "Who the hell are you?" Are you feeling well? Working on the car has taken a toll on you. - It's over. - Shall we go for a drive tomorrow? I am leaving now. Take good care of yourself. Go to sleep. The time is now. All I can give you is a moment of happiness. Everything but this. They are connected to an alarm. I have seen how they cut it off when I have to undergo treatment. Are you sure now? - I can go myself. - We only have to go to the elevator. - The elevator? - No questions, please. Hey guys! Where are you going? - Go to bed with you. - I want to cuddle. - I can go. - And I can tap. Sit in the chair. - What the hell is that? - Say hi to Bumblebee, Mazzo. - What? - It is a long story. Should I be messing around with that thing? a moment of happiness you say? - Why didn't you steal a real car? - He's onto something there. - Can you drive a car? - I can try. Can't you drive? The red car was a mirage. I've never been behind a wheel. I like to drive. Should I have pulled the plug and hidden you in a closet? I am grateful to you, Barney. It looks more like a skateboard. It requires a different way of thinking. I had completely forgotten I lived in that world. How beautiful it is here. I call that a moment of happiness. Hello? Yes, I'll be right back. What are you guys up to? Do you have any idea where he might be? I've looked in all the usual places. - Should I call the police? - No. - Are you feeling well? - Stupid question. Are you ready? You guys are insane! The red carpet is rolled out, Barney. I have always played with death. I, the crazy Mazzo. It gave me a feeling that I was alive. I have that feeling now. I feel more alive than ever... and more scared. Do not do that. I ride with you. We don't need these wasted bodies. Forget it. Take the medicine. Experiment. Wash the board clean. No. Now I'm here with you. Now you stop! - Go with you, Billy. - Why do you do that? You haven't told him? The Iceman is melting, Billy. - Our Lord at locum! - It was the memory they removed. Can you feel the wind? You drive faster and faster. Let go, Mazzo. Maybe we will be luckier in the next life. Just look at me. I came back to the same life and met Billie, Allie, Cassie, and you. Hold on to your hat and cane. Clung. Barney, what are you doing? - I'll go with him. - Why? - His life is over, yours is not. - I'm losing it all because of you. Cassie and this night never existed! No one can take those memories away from you. We have proven that. The most important memories do not disappear. Your mother stayed with you. You will be able to remember all the things you appreciate. Do not. Do as she says, Barney. I didn't have much to lose. I had no family, no loved ones. You must not take that away from me! You should choose life. Make the right choice. No, Barney! Did you hear anything? I didn't hear anything. Come in. Hello.
