Stir the oatmeal, Jenny. Stir? I mean turn, like this. - Oh, turn. - That's right. - Oh, nan? - Yes, dear? Come here a minute, will ya? I don't need to shave this morning, do I? Of course you do. Darling, don't wear that suit till I have it pressed. What's the matter with it? Those trousers look as if you were going to jump. Oh, all right. I'll change into my other suit. But you're gonna make me late, you know that, don't you? Oh, that girl! It's burnt. Jenny, I told you a hundred times to put enough water in the double boiler. Go on, answer that, hurry up. Good morning, madam. You know how much gas you waste every month? Is that so? Anywhere from two to three dollars' worth. Now, with this little device you can cut your gas bills in half. - Say again, please. - What is it? Ah, madam. You know how much gas you waste every month? I don't waste a bit. Oh, I think you'll find you do. Now, with this little device... I'm sorry, but I've tried all those things and they don't help a bit. Believe me, I know. Excuse me. But madam, if you'll just listen to me. - If you'll listen just a mo... - No good! - Breakfast ready? - Coming right up. Darling, will you answer that? I can't, I'm late already. Jenny, bring the breakfast in, will you? Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Reynolds. Oh. Darling, didn't you send in the payment on the washing machine this month? No, I didn't. Tell 'em we'll send it next month. Hello, uh, we'll send it Wednesday, sure. Yes. Goodbye. It's always something. A hundred and seventy-five a month doesn't go very far these days, does it? You're telling me, dear. Where's buddy? Buddy? Where is he? - The cellar. - In the cellar? What's he doing there? Buddy? Buddy, buddy? Yes, mother? What are you doing down there? Oh, nothing. Well, come right upstairs this minute. Yes, mother. Oh, I might have known it. Another stray dog. Oh, honey, hasn't mother told you not to drag home every dog in the neighborhood? But he was hungry, and he's a swell dog. I know, but just the same you have to put him outside. Oh, mother, please let me keep this one. Come on, nan, why don't you let him keep this one? He's not a bad looking mutt. Please, mama. Please, mama. I guess I'm outvoted. All right, Jenny, give him that lamb bone. Now you run along and wash up before you come to the table. I already washed once this morning. Don't argue, you do as mother says. All I do around here is wash. Come on, mutt. He's all boy. You bet he is. You know, I think every kid ought to have a dog. Believe me, I had one, and... Yes, dear, you told me all about that. There's that faucet in the sink again. I thought you were going to fix it. You didn't bring me any washers. Oh, darling, I haven't got time to bother with these details. You shouldn't ask me. You know that I'm busy at the office all day long. The house is your job. Well, I've sent for the plumber. See, I rubbed it off. Yes, dear. Can my dog eat breakfast with us? No, you've got all morning to play with him. Now let's see what you can do to this oatmeal. I'm getting tired of oatmeal. What are you gonna call your dog, son? Well. He's a special kind of a dog. Guess I'll call him pedigree. - Pegigree? - You mean pedigree. Maybe I'll just call him Peggy. He's not exactly that kind of a dog, but it'll do. Well, I've gotta rise and shine. Bye, Sonny. Probably a bunch of people waiting for me at the office right now. Bye, dear. - Goodbye, darling. - Bye. Plumber, he come. He would. Good morning, Mr. Simmons. That faucet's dripping again. It's the alkaline in the water, ma'am, eats the washers. I thought only acid ate rubber. Oh, yes, ma'am, acid and alkaline both. Well. Yoo-hoo! Well, if it isn't Dora the favorite sister-in-law. What are you all dressed up for? Don't you know it's dollar day? Come on, get your things on, we'll go shopping. Oh, I've got a lot to do. Tomorrow's Sunday and I've gotta get the house cleaned up. Oh, you fuss too much. Well, I've gotta finish this cake and order my groceries. Wonder what I'll have for Sunday dinner. The delicatessen cooks my Sunday dinner. George'll eat ham and potato salad and like it. Well, anyway, he'll eat it. I think I'll have a leg of lamb. That's about the best. Chicken is so high now and beef is always so tough. I tell ya, the worse you treat a husband the better they like it. You have your system and I have mine. Anyhow. Sunday wouldn't be Sunday if we didn't have a leg of lamb. That's how it is over at our house, Mrs. Reynolds. I always say to the wife it ain't Sunday without a good leg of lamb. Very interesting. Yeah. Well, that faucet won't leak again. That's what you said the last time. This time I'm in deadly earnest. How much do I owe you? Two dollars. Two dollars? It only took you a couple of minutes. Yes, but lady, just look at the cost of my preliminary education and training. Think of the years that I put in learning my profession and getting a reputation. Bunk. No, ma'am, it ain't bunk. Just look at the time I studied so that I could get good enough so as to charge two dollars for just fixing a water faucet. Now, for instance, say you go to a good doctor. Say a kidney specialist. All right, you win, I'm sold, charge it. Yes, ma'am. Well, goodbye, Mrs. Reynolds. I hope your leg of lamb turns out all right. Thank you. I made a big mistake. I should have married a plumber. Cheer up, you may yet. Says you. Gee, I wish I had somebody to do my dishes. I told George to wash 'em before he went to the office this morning but he sneaked out on me. Well, Lincoln might have freed the slaves, but he sure didn't do much for the housewife. And that's where he showed good sense. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Dora. Don't spend all your money in one place. I won't. Jenny, when you're finished there put the clothes to soak. Buddy hasn't got a clean suit. Buddy. I guess it broke. Daddy's new radio. And we haven't even made the second payment. I just wanted to see if it really had eight tubes. How do you do? I'm calling to register voters. You're Mrs. William Reynolds, aren't you? Yes. I don't believe you've registered yet. No, I haven't. Occupation? Oh, just a housewife. Housewife. Has Mr. Wilson come in yet? I haven't seen him. Nah, that's bad, that's bad. Oh, Mr. Reynolds, I'm all out of notebooks. Miss Finch, I wish you wouldn't bother me with these details. Just take a quarter from the petty cash and buy some. Thank you, Mr. Reynolds. That'll be all, miss Finch, that'll be all. Greetings, boys and girls. How do you do? Also, how have you been? Oh, hi, chief. George, I suppose you realize you're a half an hour late again. I object, your honor, it's only 29 minutes. Seriously, George, you're putting me on the spot. Much as I hate to do it I'm afraid I'll have to report you. Go right ahead, pal, no hard feelings. I know, George, but after all, you're nan's brother and I... And our little white cottages stand side by side. Yes, sir. Well, Reynolds, my trip to New York was a howling success. I landed the Duprey cosmetic account. Not bad, eh? I've gotta hand it to you, Mr. Blake. I also grabbed a stock copywriter. Patricia Berkeley. She's been writing the Duprey copy in New York. She comes to work on Monday. Have you got an office for her? Yes, the little corner office is vacant. Little corner office? What do you think she is, a clerk? This woman gets $25,000 a year. Twenty-five thousand? Certainly, move Thomas out of the big office. You can put him in the corner. Yes, sir. Get some new furniture for her, doll the place up. - Yes. - Yes? Mr. Paul Duprey calling. Oh, why, send him right in. What's this? That's the time sheet. You'll notice that some of the boys have been coming in late again. For the love of Mike, Reynolds, don't annoy me with these petty things, that's your job. What do you think I pay you for? Hello, Paul, how are ya? - Very well, thanks. - Wow, glad to see you. Did you fly or take the train from New York? I flew. Well, sit right there, Paul, I think you'll find that comfortable. - Thank you. - Smoke? Yeah, much obliged. Well, oh. This is Reynolds, our office manager. Mr. Duprey. How do you do, Mr. Reynolds? Well, Paul, I've got a great advertising campaign all lined up for this new skin fluid of yours. I hope it's great enough to make a few million women pay five dollars a jar for it. Larmes de anges. Tears of the angels. It's a magnificent label, Paul. Confidentially, Paul, is this stuff any good? Well, it oughtta be. It's made of the finest mutton tallow the stockyards can produce. Well, am I fired? The old man was pretty sore, but I talked him out of it. What's the matter, bill, you look kind of down. Did Blake bawl you out about something? Oh, every time I go in there he bawls me out. Hey, listen. For the last five years I wanted to take a poke at him. Why don't you tell him what he can do with his job? You think I won't? I've half a mind to do it right now. That's the way to talk. I'm not afraid of Blake or a million Blakes. Reynolds, come in here and take these Duprey estimates and step on it. Yes, Mr. Blake, yes, sir. Dad. Oh, hello, Mr. Reynolds. How was Sunday school? Fine. Dad, is Gabriel boss of all the angels? Um... Did your Sunday school teacher say so? Yup, that's what she said. Well, she's right. He was the head man. Talking about angels, where's my dog? Oh, bill, how about sticking to one station? There's nothing good on. There, that sounds good. - Remember that? - Sure. Our honeymoon. That Italian orchestra used to play it. Remember they had on funny green suits with gold braid. I'll never forget them. And that cute little outdoor restaurant where we used to have wine with our dinner every night. Those summer nights. It was lovely. The moonlight on the water. Wasn't it wonderful, bill? Yeah. Atlantic city's a swell place. Yoo-hoo! Hello, kinfolks. What do you think? Let me tell it, woman, let me tell it. You know what happened to me? The most wonderful thing! Oh, wait a minute, will you let me tell it? Well, go on and tell it. I am telling it. What's it all about, George? Folks, you are now gazing upon the first assistant radio contact man of the seagrade advertising agency. And he's getting a $20 raise. How wonderful! Boy, that's a raise, what I mean. So I've been late to work every morning this week, have I? And you think I was out getting my hair styled? The answer is no. I was out looking for a better job. And did I get it? The answer is yes. George, that's swell. It just shows what the old personality will do. Come on, we gotta tell the Johnsons. - And the drakes. - We'll be seeing ya. I can't tell you how happy I am, George. Thanks, sis. Many up. Twenty dollar raise. He was making 160 a month. He'll be making more than I am. Gee, the luck of some people. It isn't luck. It's self confidence and push. Ah, you've been reading those success magazines. I don't have to. Why, George hasn't got one tenth your brains. I don't care if he is my brother. But he isn't afraid to take a chance. You are. Well, you haven't had a raise in five years. You're getting in a rut. In a rut? I got a steady job when there are millions of guys pounding the pavement looking for work. We're getting along all right. I know. But do you think just getting along is enough? Oh, just because George accidentally got a break... Remember when we were first married? The big plans we had. The home we were going to buy. Our trip to Europe. And then there's buddy. He'll be grown up before we realize it. We'll wanna send him to college. This country is full of college graduates and what are they doing? Selling insurance. That doesn't prove a thing. It's the men who take a chance occasionally that get ahead. So you think I'm a flop, eh? No, I don't, honey, you know I don't. Well, you certainly sound like it. Dinner is ready. All right, Jenny. Come on, honey, let's forget it. There goes that faucet again. It's the alkaline, it eats the washers. Or so the plumber said. Leg of lamb again? Oh, and dripping faucets. I broke dish. Excuse, please. This way, miss Berkeley. Well, this is your office, miss Berkeley. I hope it's satisfactory. It's a might pretty country around here. Glad you like it, we did our best. Well, an office is just an office. Besides, I won't be in it very much. - You...? - Don't worry. I get my best ideas in the bath tub. Well, if you'd like the office moved to the bathroom just let me know. That is an idea. Think you've stumbled on something big there. Now if there's anything you want, miss Berkeley, just call bill Reynolds, the office manager. - Bill Reynolds? - Yeah. I once knew a boy by that name. I went to school with him right here in Chicago. Well, I didn't know that you'd been here to Chicago before. Been here? Say, I was born and raised on the south side. I've tasted Illinois central cinders until I escaped to New York five years ago. And the rolling stone rolled home again. I wonder if it's the same Reynolds. He was a senior and I was a freshman. Well, what did he look like? Oh, the big football hero type. We went to the old Hyde park high school. He had all the girls' hearts going pitter-pat including mine. He was so awfully good looking. That lets our Reynolds out. Yes, my Reynolds is probably running guns into south America or hunting emeralds in Siam. He was one of those men born to live a glamorous life. Now, I want you to be quite at home here, miss Berkeley, just call me any time you want to and don't stand on ceremony. Thanks, I never do. Good luck. Yes? Is this the office manager? - Yes. - This is miss Berkeley. My office needs some managing. Will you bring me an ash tray and a waste basket and some matches? Certainly miss Berkeley, right away. Come in. Bill Reynolds. Ruth. Ruth Smith. That's out. I'm Patricia Berkeley now. Sounds better for a copywriter. What? Ah, you've changed a lot Ruth, pat, I mean, miss Berkeley. Kind of gone up in the world, haven't ya? Well, I've done all right. I suddenly found out I had some brains and decided to use them. I uh, I've sent out for your waste paper basket. They have nice ash trays in your shop, haven't they? Oh, yes, it's a very efficiently run company. Thanks. - Still married to nan? - You bet I am. Dying to see her. She'll be glad to see you, too. Did you ever get married? No. Oh, uh, by the way. Nan's downtown shopping today. She's going to have lunch with me. You mean she's going to have lunch with me. Will she be surprised. Waiter. Yes, madam. This isn't the dressing I ordered. But madam, it's salad Maurice made with citron. Well, I prefer it made with Chablis. Very well, madam, I am sorry, I'll change it. I thought it was delicious. It isn't half as good as it is at the canal Sauvage in Paris. - Cigarette? - No, thanks. Eight years can make a lot of difference, can't it, pat? The last time I saw you we just graduated from high school. Couple of silly kids. Silly is right. And now you're a big success. Here you are living at the best hotel in town. I haven't been to this place since I was married. Bill hasn't exactly set the world on fire, has he? Oh, he isn't doing so badly for these times. At least we're not in debt much. You were always a good sport, nan. It isn't that. I happen to be in love with bill. I understand that. I was, too, once. Is that why you went to New York? Because I married bill? Of course. I often wondered about that. Well, I wasn't going to carry the torch around here so I shipped my burning heart to New York and, well, I carved a career for myself. To put the fire out. And I have to shop in bargain basements. You're happy, aren't you? Very. And you? No kicks, no complaints. So she thinks I'm getting fat, huh? She's right. What do you mean? Look at that bay window starting. You can hardly see it. Why don't you take some exercise? Oh, darling, after a hard day at the office, you know, with everything on my shoulders I certainly don't feel very energetic. No, I guess not. It's a shame, too. Pat and I were talking today about what a grand football player you used to be. Oh, I'm getting sick and tired of hearing about what pat said. This is great stuff. Where'd you get that? Pat treated me to a jar this afternoon, shopping. Wasn't it sweet of her? Oh, the darn stuff is a fake anyhow. I'm in a position to know. Why, bill, it couldn't be, they charge five dollars a jar. You've been reading the ads again. They wouldn't dare charge that much if it wasn't any good. You're just like all the rest of the women. Just because a thing costs a lot of money you think it oughtta be good. And if that's true why not charge ten dollars a jar? Ten dollars? Say, darling, that's a great idea. I think I'll tell Blake about it in the morning. Oh, there's that faucet again. Come in. Oh, pardon me, you're busy. Come on in, bill, we're almost through. You caught the idea perfectly, miss Berkeley. This is just what we want. What is it, Reynolds? Well, you see, Mr. Blake, I thought of a great idea last night and I'm sure you can use it. If women will pay five dollars a jar for Duprey's cream why won't they pay ten dollars? Say, what's the matter with you, Reynolds? Are you drunk? Oh, no, now wait a minute, Mr. Blake, here's the angle. Go right on charging five dollars for the original stuff. That's exactly what Duprey intends to do. Right, but it was my idea to have two kinds. Single and double strength. Put different labels on the double strength and charge ten for it. Reynolds, you stick to your job, mind your papers and pencils and we'll mind the ideas. Go away, I'm busy. Just another clerk who thinks he's an executive. Mr. Reynolds, you're not leaving? Why not? It's only 4:30. You're leaving early, ain't you, Mr. Reynolds? Yeah. You don't generally leave till 5:30 and I hope you ain't sick. I'm sick about a lot of things. Listen, darling. I wanted you to get this mad for a long time. You've gotta take that big step sometime, what's the matter with right now? What big step? Quit that job, start in for yourself. You know all about the advertising business. And it takes more than brains to run an advertising agency. - A little nerve. - Yes, and plenty of money. Why darling, where did you get all that? Seventeen hundred and forty-two dollars. And 39 cents. The reward of five years shopping in bargain basements and roast leg of lamb on Sunday. Darling, you're wonderful. What do you say? This will last us for six months and by that time if we flop, well, we've been broke before. Boy, I certainly like to show that guy, Blake. You and me both. - Well? - It's a bet. Now you're talking. Good morning, Mrs. Reynolds good morning, miss Martin. Is Mr. Reynolds busy? Busy? He must be worn out. He's been arguing with that Krueger fellow an hour and a half. Oh, dear, and I wanted to see him. Mr. Krueger, I promise you, no, I guarantee you, that the Krueger pork sausage will become a household word from the rock bottom coast of Maine to the sunny shores of California. Yeah, I know, promises, guarantees, guarantees, promises, that's the way Blake used to always talk. But it isn't talk with us, Mr. Krueger. We actually get results. Oh, come on, Mr. Krueger, give us a chance to prove it. Here. Have another cigar, Mr. Krueger. I'm afraid I get indigestion. That's five already. Well, what do you say, Mr. Krueger? Well, I wish I wouldn't smoke so many of your cigars. Then I could say "no" easier. Now, Mr. Krueger, you're an intelligent man. That I admit. And you make the best pork sausages in the country. There's an inspiration in your product. Great music inspires violinists. Beautiful sunsets inspire painters. And the Krueger pork sausage company would be an everlasting inspiration to the William H. Reynolds company to do something fine. Something outstanding. Something that will inspire 125 million citizens of this country to become pork sausage conscious. Say, pork sausage ain't got no conscience. And why should the fiddle player perspire in the sun... That's the great problem with all you advertisement fellas. A lot of talk, expense, but no results. This is Mr. Reynolds, speaking. Who? The Schnitzer sausage company? It's me, bill, nan, don't you understand? Talk to me as though I were a rival sausage account. Pretend I'm Mr. Schnitzer. Oh, hello, Mr. Schnitzer. Oh, you want an appointment. Well, uh, I'm afraid I'm very busy right now, but I think I could manage to give you a few minutes say uh, tomorrow at four. Schnitzer, say, listen. Now don't have nothing to do with Schnitzer. Don't even let him come into your office. He wants to spend $50,000 advertising. He wants to spend, you needn't be sure. You know what he puts in his sausages? It's irrelevant. No, he don't use that. But he does put in the scum of the earth. Hello? Mr. Schnitzer, I think I'll have to call you back. I'm, I'm too busy to talk to you right now, yeah. He wants to advertise. He wants to steal away my business from me, that's what it is. All right, I'll show him how to advertise. That's great, that's swell. That is, of course, if you wouldn't mind taking such a small account like mine. Mr. Krueger, it may be small right now, but remember, that great oaks from little acorns grow. That's fine, that sounds like poetry, yeah? Maybe we can use that. Why not? Great aches on little corns grow. Great corns grow on... What is that you said again? Great oaks from little acorns grow. I'll have those contracts ready for you in the morning, Mr. Krueger. Send them over to my office. Yeah. You know my address. Yes. Oh, here, take this to smoke on your way home. I don't think I ought to take it, but I will. Oh, I beg your pardon, that's broken. - Here, take this one. - Oh, thank you. Say, Reynolds, give the broken one to Schnitzer. Did it work? - I'm wringing wet. - Boy, what a session. He wouldn't sign? What do you mean he wouldn't sign? I had to give him both barrels, but he's in the bag. Our fist account. Put it there. Congratulations, partner. Oh, miss Martin, make a note of this before I forget it. Great oaks from little acorns grow. It looks all right. Sure. What good does it do? Don't be discouraged, bill, we're just starting. Starting? In business six months and just one little measly account? I know. But Rome wasn't built in a day. Yeah. With all the bills we owe how can I help but be discouraged? Ah, what's the use of kidding ourselves? The Reynolds advertising agency is headed for the last roundup. Seems a shame. After the swell start we had. Wonder if Blake would give me back my old job? You can't do that, bill! I won't let you! As a matter of fact I was thinking about going down there this afternoon and sound him out, but Duprey's in town, you can't get near Blake. - Duprey? - Mm. Say, how long has his contract with Blake got to run? Oh, it expires sometime this month, I think. Why? Bill Reynolds, there's no reason in this world why you can't get that account. The Duprey cosmetic account? Sure, why not? Do you realize that they spend a million dollars a year advertising? And a five percent agency commission is 50,000. The Reynolds family could buy an awful lot of groceries. Yeah. There's isn't a Chinaman's chance. Blake is bound to set 'em up on a long term contract. What's the idea? I just feel like having a drink. Want one? Darling, you never drink unless we're at a party or something. Maybe this is something. I'm going right over the hotel and put salt on his tail. You know what I'd tell him if it was me? What? You're him, see? And I'm you. Yeah, that's right, that's right. Strong, see? "Look here, Duprey. "If women'll pay five dollars a jar for larmes des anges, "they'll pay ten. "All depends on the way your advertising is. "Women think it's good because you charge five dollars. "But if you charge ten dollars, "they'll think it's twice as good." That's what I'd tell him. Well, you don't have to tell me what to tell him, I know what to tell him. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Then I'd say, "Duprey, you're a fool to let Blake "keep your account. "Why, he hasn't had an original idea "since Taft was president." Don't worry, I'll tell that fella plenty. And don't forget, you see him, see him if you have to break the door down. Listen, I'll break every door in the place if I don't see him. And don't forget, tell him. Listen, this is important, I got to see him. I told you, sir. Mr. Duprey is not in. Quit stalling, go on, ring his room, ring his room. Mr. Duprey. I got a great idea for you. I beg your pardon? I'm Reynolds of the William H. Reynolds company, advertising counsel. Well, you see Samuel Blake, he handles all my advertising. That's what's the trouble with it. Mr. Duprey, I got a marvelous idea for you. Don't bother me. It'll only take me a minute to tell you. Why, I can double your business if you just give me a chance. Taxi, taxi! Follow that car and don't spare the horses. Mr. Duprey. Mr. Duprey. If you'll just give me a few minute of your time. Will you stop bothering me! Please, Mr. Duprey. How did you get in here? Two dollars looks awfully big to a chamber maid. I'll give you ten dollars to get out of here and stop pestering me. Duprey, you're a fool. I beg your pardon. You let Blake handle your business. Half the time he doesn't know what day it is. He hasn't had an original idea since Taft was president. I've been suspecting that myself for some time. I don't suspect, I know. It takes his whole big organization to rectify silly mistakes. I oughtta know, I used to belong to the organization. - I think I know now why - you got fired. Who got fired? - I resigned. Oh. To open my own agency and put Blake out of business. And speaking of business how would you like to double your profits? - I don't think I'd mind. - All right. Now you charge five dollars a jar for larmes des anges. Go right on doing it. But put out another jar, Mark it double strength and put on a different label and charge ten dollars. And with a smart advertising campaign you can't miss. Hm. You know, that's just crazy enough to work. - Could you do with a drink? - I could do miracles. Bill, what happened? I've met the enemy and he is mine. You really got to talk to him? Talk to him? Say, listen, Paul and I are buddies. He's the best friend I got in the world. What? I'm telling you, I signed him to a two year contract. Oh, darling, that's marvelous, that's wonderful! But he wouldn't sign unless I got pat Berkeley to write his copy. So I went over to her place and got her out of bed and I signed her to a contract. You didn't! Honestly? Well, I don't know how honest it is, but I got her. And I'm paying her $100 a week more than Blake paid her. Oh, boy, wait till Blake finds out. Yeah, hope he does, I hope he does. And the sooner the better. And I hope he gets tough because I'd like to punch him right in the nose. Oh, by the way, dear. I stopped by next door and I hired George as our office manager. You know, honey? I just discovered tonight what's been the matter with me for years. What? I don't drink enough. Mr. Reynolds is in conference. But I came all the way from Seattle for this appointment. I'll inform you when you can see him. I've been waiting over an hour for Mr. Reynolds. Well, I'm not gonna wait an hour. If I can't see him now there's plenty of other advertising agencies in town. I'll see what can be done. Mr. Wilson? Yes, they're pressed for time. But they're in a rush. Well, why didn't you say so? Hold them here and I'll be right out. You can't go in there now. Good ol' George. The boss' watchdog. No, no, no, no, I'm serious. He's up to his ears in the big conference. Tell him to pull his ears in. Not another minute. Gentlemen. An apology's noted plus a little explanation. You see, Mr. Reynolds unexpectedly, very unexpectedly received a visit from his board of directors. Big things are going on in there. Oh. Don't worry about it, Paul, I'm sure you're gonna like it. Hello, darling, I thought you'd gone. I'll see you to the car. Oh, nevermind, darling, I know you're terribly busy. Well, allow me, I'm going anyway. Oh, thanks. We'll get together in a day or so. - Goodbye, darling. - See you tonight, dear. Bill, there's a couple of cash cows waiting outside there and miss Berkeley wants to see ya. Well, stall the customers a little longer. I'll see miss Berkeley first. Say, you're harder to get to than the president. I've been trying to crash your gate all morning. Sorry, I was tied up. What do you think of it? I think "discriminating" would be a better word here than "particular". You're right. The change is amazing. Only changed one word. Oh, I don't mean that. I mean you. The last few months. This is a very interesting layout. What's funny? Oh, everything. I was just thinking what a crush I used to have on you. When I was a freshman in pinafores and you were a football star. You've done a little changing yourself. When we went to school... Go on, bill, say it. I was a freckle-faced brat in 98 cent dresses and cotton stockings. Say, what'd you ever do about those freckles? Made 'em vanish with larmes des anges. Bet that dress didn't cost 98 cents. Oh, these models start at $1.15. And those cotton stockings? Gone the way of all flesh. Only her fairy prince didn't turn out to be an advertising man. Say, pat, uh, why can't we have lunch... Come in. Say, chief, those two guys are still waiting. One of them is from Seattle. He's gonna put on his roller skates and start back. All right. Later we'll have to have another little conference about this. Whatever you say, Mr. Reynolds. Okay. My, my, my. Is this a ducky house or is it a ducky house? I'm glad you like it, Dora. And the furniture is scrumptious. Perfect. Except that table. There, that's the way it ought to be. I used to study interior decorating. - By mail. - I remember. You used to borrow stamps to mail in your lessons. - That's right! - Oh, Bolton. - Yes, madam? - You may serve tea now. Yes, madam. Why don't you make him wear those cute knee pants? Oh, Dora. You and George won't disappoint us Friday night for the big house warming? A house warming? Try and keep us away. That's buddy. Great Lakes military academy. Hm. What a long tail our cat has. It's dreadfully expensive and a lot of nonsense, I think. But you know how bill is about buddy. Even the best isn't good enough. Mom home? Your mother is in the living room, sir. Ah, Bolton, cut the sir. Just call me buddy. Yes, sir. Bolton, you're too polite to be human. Yes, sir. Hello, darling. How's my big boy? Say, mom. Aren't you gonna kiss your aunt Dora? Aw... Daddy home? Not yet. He's coming home for dinner, isn't he? You know daddy works every Wednesday night. Last night wasn't Wednesday and he had to work. Well, that just happened. Aw mother, daddy's always at that office. Run along and get dressed for dinner. Oh, all right. Goodbye, aunt Dora. Goodbye. Always at the office, huh? The minute they get a bankroll they're all alike. You poor darling. Don't be foolish, Dora. Being the boss isn't like working for a salary, you know. You can't watch the clock when you're responsible for everything. Big business doesn't run itself. I'm gonna give you some advice, nan. When they start pulling the night work gag, they're up to something. Bill isn't like that. They're all that way. Working day and night. The same old alibis. Believe me, I know all the answers. I'm afraid you've just got a suspicious nature, Dora. Yeah, backed up by years of sad experience. Listen, Dora, this is all very silly. Bill hasn't the time, the energy, nor the inclination to be playing around. Have another cup of tea. My fine Japanese instinct tells me you're a prize sap. I'd love another cup of tea. Isn't this better than sandwiches and coffee at the office? If I said "no" I'd be an awful liar. What's the matter, mother? Oh, nothing. Eat your carrots, dear. Can I phone daddy after dinner? I wouldn't bother daddy at the office, darling. Eat your carrots, now, they'll make you big and strong. I don't like carrots. But I'll eat 'em. The right way to top off a perfect dinner. Napoleon Brandy. Real thing. If Napoleon drank that stuff the waiter served us last night no wonder he lost the battle of Waterloo. Last night. And now tonight. It's getting to be a habit. A nice one, if you ask me. Sure, but uh, that old devil conscience is knocking at my door. Tell him nobody home. Yeah, he keeps right on knocking. Well, if it's that serious you run right along home to ma. Oh, now don't take that attitude, pat. After this we work at the office. I didn't mean it that way. You don't have to apologize to me. I know you like a book. It's just that I happen... You just happen to be provincial and I'm not. I believe every man's an individual. The fact you're married shouldn't interfere with your friendships, come on. Come on, little boy. Well, there's no argument. I agree with you 100%. You didn't say that a minute ago. Pat. I can't tell you what these last few months have meant to me. I consider our friendship one of the finest things that's ever come in to my life. Do you, bill? You know I do. Get better results, bill, if you put the sugar in before you stir it. Was pat at the office last night, too? What prompted that remark? Just routine feminine curiosity. Say, what is this, a cross examination? If it is, the defendant is certainly acting guilty. You weren't at the office, were you, bill? You were out with pat. Well, suppose I was. Is that a crime? Can't a man have any friends just because he happens to be married? There's no such a thing as friendship between a married man and a woman like pat. Oh, you're just an old fashioned housewife. Listen. This is an age of individuality and it's about time you were finding it out. I am finding it out, bill. I am. Being taken care of, Mr. Krueger? Everything is wonderful. You don't gotta take care of me, I'm getting a fine time - at your party. - Good. How about a cigar? I've got a special brand made up for me in Cuba. I can hardly wait to try it. Bolton, some cigars, please. Thank you. Smells like [speaking Spanish]. Smells like a good cigar. I'm glad you like it. I like your party. That all you got to tell me? I could tell you something else. Cigarettes? Oh, thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. That's what I want, one of those pancakes. Pancakes, George, I'm ashamed of you. You're insulting the finest crepes Suzette I've ever tasted. Crepes Suzette? It's nothing but a fancy pancake. What are you kicking me for? Was that you? Oh, pardon me. This better be good. Won't you have one, Paul? No thanks, no I've had four already. Mom? Mom? Her master's voice. Darling, what are you doing down here? Mom, I can't sleep. Well, I don't think anyone could sleep with all this noise. You'll catch cold, darling. Now run upstairs to bed, quick. Come on, tuck me in. Be a good sport. All right, darling. May I come, too? Why, yes, if you like. Where did you get that bun? It's not a bun, it's a pancake. Pretty swell world tonight, isn't it? That's a boy. There now, go to sleep. I'll change this for something to eat. What? And have you screaming with the collywobbles all night? Forget it, young man. Goodnight, dear. Goodnight, mom. Goodnight, Mr. Duprey. Hope you have a good time. Thanks, goodnight, old chap. We'll see they keep quiet so that you can get some sleep. Goodnight. You know, I've been a bachelor all my life, born and brought up in hotels. This is the first time I've ever regretted it. Very interesting. We'll have to see if we can't find you some nice girl. I have found her already. Really? Uhhuh. Yes, I found her. But I'm just a trifle late. Shall we go downstairs? Ah, let me think, let me... Oh, yes. And if you can give us the proper discount you can consider this an order for a half dozen bottles of black ink. Got that, Rosabelle? Yes, Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson speaking. This is Joe Stevens over at wql. The rehearsal of Duprey program's going on in 15 minutes. We thought Mr. Reynolds was coming over to hear it. I thought that rehearsal was set for tonight. Well, that's the final rehearsal for Mr. Duprey. We always like to get the agency's okay before the sponsor hears it. You're right, old man, absolutely right. Hang on a second. Is the boss back yet? No, Mr. Wilson, he's still out to lunch. Four-thirty he's still out to lunch. This is delightful. Mr. Reynolds is out of the office just now attending a big conference. Oh, very important. Oh, I couldn't disturb him there. I'll do my best. Gee, the rehearsal goes on in 15 minutes and it's plenty important. Somebody oughtta hear it before Duprey does. Why don't you go, Mr. Wilson? You're awfully good at those things. You're right, Rosabelle. As long as we can't find the boss I might as well do the dirty work. Harry, have you seen the boss? No, I haven't. Heard him tell his secretaries he went out to lunch and he'd be tied up most of the afternoon. I hope this broadcast is going to be as good as bill thinks it is. I hope so, too. George. You sure this program's going to be all right? Don't worry, bill, it's a knockout, it'll keep ya in stitches. You better be right. I haven't even heard the darn thing. We're all ready, Mr. Duprey. Go right ahead. Good evening, folks. This is the voice of the Duprey cosmetic hour. Have you got wrinkles in your face? Duprey puts those wrinkles where your best friends can't find 'em. If your skin isn't as smooth as a billiard ball, run, don't walk, for a jar of larmes des anges, the magic skin fluid. I don't know if I'm sayin' it right, folks, but it's great stuff no matter how you pronounce it. And now we will give you music lovers a treat. First you will hear the golden voiced crooning fool, Mike Hathaway, former star of the Ajax brassiere hour, who will sing the regular Duprey cosmetics song. And here he is. If your skin has got the hue of a plate of oyster stew darling, use cosmetics by Duprey and if the rings around your eyes are as big as apple pies sweetheart, use cosmetics by Duprey and if the hair on your head is not so wavy just give three cheers for the army and the Navy and if your lips are dry as Clay fly the Duprey flag and say anchors aweigh and use cosmetics by Duprey now folks, here's Rastus and sambo, thos inevitable comedians, purveyors of Dixie jokes. Give till it hurts, boys. Hey, Rastus. Who is that lady I seen you with last night? Lady? That was no lady, that was a female impersonator. Boy, you slay me. You posolutely kill me. Say, Sambo, I see you all been chopping up your razor lately. Why, that was no razor. No? It's too awful. Now, wait a minute, Paul. It may not be very artistic, but it's the kind of thing that'll sell your product. Well, I don't know about that, but I do know I'd much rather not listen to it. Paul this is only a rehearsal. It isn't too late to make some changes. It's impossible. Now, Paul, why don't we go out to the house and talk this over? I don't think so, nan, I'm sorry, but I'm tired. I think I'll get a little supper and go to bed. We'll all have supper at our house. How about it? Well, it's rather late. It's never too late for crepes suzettes. I'll make some. Does that sound tempting? Well, your crepes suzettes would tempt anyone. Oh, come on, we'll be home in a jiffy. All right. I need something to take the taste of that broadcast out of my mouth. I'll have you purring like a cat. Come on, pat. You know, Paul, your cosmetics are a luxury product. They lend themselves to a romantic program. Don't you agree? I'd agree to almost anything after that magnificent food. No, seriously. Maybe this program could have a parisienne atmosphere. A string orchestra playing a French serenade. The feeling of the boulevards in springtime. And perhaps a few little characteristic sketches. Why not? We could take our audience to the champs elysees, the Ritz bar, and longchamp. That's it. Yes, you know, that might be fine. And afterwards we might use the riviera, nice, - and Monte Carlo. - Lovely! You know, that's a very good idea. What do you think of it, bill? Won't you have another cup of coffee, Paul? No thanks, no thanks. One-thirty, I must be going. - I'm sorry. - So am I. Excuse me. How about it, pat? Can I give you a lift? Why, yes, certainly. I'll help you with your things, pat. Thanks, nan. It's too bad you weren't listening, bill. I was discussing that radio program with your wife. She's got some very interesting angles. I'll drop into your office tomorrow and talk it over. Fine. Nan's a pretty clever girl. Yeah. Perhaps the cleverest member of your family. I suppose you think you're in love with bill. Nan, have you any darker powder? Oh, I'm sorry. See if that'll do. Thanks. You were saying? Oh. Yes. Bill and I love each other very much. What usually happens in these cases. Sometimes the wife gets stubborn and puts up a fight. Then again, she accepts the inevitable. If she's smart. You know, pat, most men lose their heads when they get too much money. It's like a bad dream. And they always wake up in the morning with a very bad hangover. Sorry, nan. If anyone's dreaming it must be you. I'm afraid that's a question that you and I can never decide. Such a wide difference of opinion. Well, let's leave it at that. See what happens. We'll see. There. - I'm ready now. - So am I. Here we are, Paul. - 'Night, darling. - See you tomorrow. Goodnight, nan. Thanks so much for a charming evening. Goodnight. And now the first Duprey hour comes to an end. Next week we will take you to the Ritz bar in Paris. Au revoir till next Thursday. Well, that's more like it. Sell Duprey, which is the main thing. You know, when he heard that last rehearsal he was grinning from ear to ear. It's one for the book. Believe it or not it's the first radio contract that was ever saved with crepes suzettes. And the Paris angle was a happy thought. Nan's a very smart girl. Yes, she has improved a great deal in the last year. I'm terribly fond of her. You know, you're very understanding, pat. Why can't more women be like you? Well, here's to the third angle of our happy little triangle. Bill. What about nan? Well, there's no hurry, is there dear? You've been promising to tell her for weeks. Why don't you get it over with tonight? I was wondering. I thought perhaps tomorrow... Bill, it's like diving into cold water. The quicker you take the plunge, the sooner you recover from the shock. You're right. I know I am. I'll let you know what happens. If you don't phone me I'll call you. - All right, bye-bye. - Bye. I've seen this coming. I've had a lot of time to think it over. You're just wasting your breath, bill. I won't do it. Why, it's ridiculous our going on like this. We're not married and we're not divorced. We've been married for a long time and we're going to stay that way. We started from nowhere. Had a lot of tough sledding. And through all that we loved each other. Now that you're successful you wanna throw me over for the first good looking woman you think you're in love with. I don't think, I know. Now why can't we talk about this calmly? Why do you have to cry? I can't help crying. About someone that you've laughed with so much. Let's don't get sentimental. Doesn't pat ever get sentimental? Oh, I think we better leave her out of this. I wish we could. But she's trying to destroy something that belongs to you and me and I'm not going to let her do it. Quite a while ago I told a minister I was taking you for better or for worse. And for plenty of those years things couldn't have been much worse. And now that they're better I'm not going to let a chisel like her step in. I see no necessity for you talking that way about pat. She certainly doesn't talk that way about you. Why should she? I'm not trying to break up her home. This isn't getting us anywhere. - Either you divorce me... - No, absolutely no. I'm surprised at you. Trying to hang on to a man that wants to leave you. Haven't you got any pride? Daddy! Hey, wait a minute! I haven't seen you since last Sunday. Stop! Where are you going? Buddy! Buddy, darling! Sweetheart! Oh... Oh, my darling. Get a doctor, get a doctor! Thank you. Well? Buddy'll pull through, all right. But it'll take a long time. Nan. You understand that everything I said downstairs, I mean about the divorce, is off. You were willing to leave me before this happened to buddy, weren't you? It is not me you want, it's buddy. You can see him as often and as much as you please after we're divorced. I find, bill, that after all, I have got some pride. Nan, darling, please. Hello. Is Mr. Reynolds there? He'll be right over, pat. Mr. Duprey to see you, madam. Oh, bring him out here, Bolton. How are you, Paul? Always the same. - How's buddy? - Just fine. He started back to school this morning. Oh, that's great. May I have one? Why not? Have you seen anything of bill lately? No, not since he moved to the club. Won't you sit down? Thanks. Your divorce comes up next month, doesn't it? No backing out, hm? No. Nan, I'm afraid this is a little premature and not quite according to the rules. But I'm terribly in love with you. I do wish you'd marry me. Paul, you're sweet. You haven't answered me. It's too soon. My mind is so confused and I can't think straight. - When it's all over... - There's no hurry. And at least you haven't said "no". Is it true that the actions of the defendant during this period caused you great mental anguish? It is. Is it also true that the defendant on a number of occasions spoke sharply to you? Yes, your honor. And according to the complaint this made you extremely nervous. Well, it did and it didn't. You see, judge, I'm inclined to be nervous at times anyway. No wonder. After the way I treated her. And here you say that the defendant became extremely irritable and morose. I certainly did. Well, anyone can become irritable temporarily, bill. But I had no right to treat you that way. I object, your honor. I'm sorry, your honor. But my client is unaccustomed to court procedure. If you'll answer these questions properly we'll go on with the case. Did the defendant become irritable and morose? Well, judge, at times he acted sort of, sort of like a bad child. But most men are childish at times. Darling, please, let's call the whole thing off. I object, your honor. I object, too, your honor. Well, this is the most preposterous and undignified case I have ever tried. We've got 3,699 divorce cases on our calendar and you people are wasting my time. Call the next case. Be a good fellow, Paul and take me to dinner? Why not? I'm gonna drink my dinner. Straight. I'll always be two courses ahead of you. Sort of a consolation for the losers. Mhmm. Is mother home? We don't wanna buy anything. - We've got everything. - What is it, dear? I would like to speak to Mrs. William H. Reynolds. I'm Mrs. Reynolds. I'm calling to register voters. I don't believe you registered. No, I haven't, at least not in this precinct. - Won't you come in? - Oh, thank you. Sit down. Run along, sweetheart. That's Mrs. William H. Reynolds. Yes. Look all right, darling? You'll do. Occupation? - Just a housewife. - And what a housewife.
