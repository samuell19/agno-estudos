Hello? Can anybody hear me? Hello? Is anybody out there? Hello? Hey. Good morning, sunshine. I see that you overslept again. It's my day off. I think I deserve at least one morning where I can get some decent rest. Well, if you weren't out all night partying, you wouldn't have to waste half of the next day asleep. So is there something that you needed or are you just trying to tell me how to run my life again? Oh, no, of course not, sweetie. I just wanted to let you know that I'll be in your neck of the woods this weekend and I thought maybe we could do lunch. Yeah, that should be fine. I have a job interview on Saturday but I'm not really sure what time it is. I'll have to double check the time. OK, well, how about you send me a text later and let me know? All right. I'll talk to you then. This is the ultimate test. If this works, we'll be heroes. I don't know. I didn't earn my degree to be playing mad scientist in a scary basement with a sketchy serum. This might be our only shot at a vaccine. If this works, we can replicate it. We'll be able to stop the H73 virus from spreading in the US. It's only a matter of days. I hope you're right, Doctor. What the fuck is going on in there? You keep watch. I'll check it out. Holy shit. What the fuck is going on here? We need to get the hell out of Dodge. Let's go. All right. Hi, girl. Jesus, you scared the shit out of me. So what's the plan for tonight? Well, I figured we'd crash the museum. Miles is working. So we get the place all to ourselves all night? Fuck yes! It's going to be one hell of a night. Hey, man. You all right? You don't sound so good. Good. We have a major problem, Governor. What? What now? There was an accident at the lab. Dr. Shaw, Dr. Mattei, they were attacked by the patients. So? Get them to the hospital, foot me the bill. What's the problem? Sir, they're dead. What? That's not the only problem. Those two work release lunatics you appointed to guard the lab are nowhere to be found and neither is the H73 vaccine. I appointed my ass. Blame makes lame. Now get the hell out of my office. Now. Shut the damn door on your way out. Who hires these nimrods? Oh, god. What the hell happened back there, man? You all right? I'll be fine. It's just a scratch. All right, well, what are we doing now? Where are we going? We need to find somewhere to hold up for the nights. When those dudes in black show up looking for the vaccine, we're nowhere in sight. They're gathering inmates for sure, and I ain't going back to jail. What? Did you say something? I didn't hear anything. Wait. OK I know I heard something. They're coming to get you, Barbara. Seriously, it's not funny. Oh. He does not look OK. Wait, you're not going out there, are you? Just a second. Oh, man. This is a national emergency. The Center for Disease Control has confirmed the existence and spread of a highly contagious disease. This highly contagious degenerative virus is transmitted through blood, saliva, and other bodily fluids of the infected. Yo. You might tell us what's going on? Yeah, what gives? We haven't finished our drinks yet. You two dummies not hear that man on the radio just now? You don't really believe that shit, do you? Shit or not, I'm getting my shit and I'm closing my doors till tomorrow morning and I ain't opening for nobody. Aren't you going to see what is? Hell no. Now that don't sound right. I think it's gone. I'm going to take a peek. You two wait right here. That was so much fun. We really appreciate you letting us come in so late and that you've got that one strange display up. It's no worries, and it was a quiet night, so I appreciate you guys coming by, and why don't you guys have a good evening, OK? We loved it. Are you going to get the Clark Gable display in any time soon? Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. We had a lot of fun. Good. You know what, you guys have a great evening, OK? Oh, you too. Thanks. Thanks for everything. You're very welcome. Drive safe, OK? You bet. Lay off that hooch. I'm telling you, you're not that young anymore. You can't be drinking that Jagermeister and Red Bull. It's time to get this party started! Watch out. Woohoo! Yes, girl! Listen, girls, let's not get too wild, OK? Bring it down a notch. Oh, come on, Debbie Downer. Look-- hey, hey, hey, listen to me. Listen to me. Waspish likes to come into my shift once in a while to check up, OK? Hey, hey, besides, that H70 virus is going around. You hear me? And, hey, I don't want to hit nothing your lips have been on lately. Oh, that's fake news. It's bullshit. Zombies? Really? That's what I'm hearing. Do not exist. Bigshot. Mister-- I see a couple of nice ones in there. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeehaw! Hey, put that down there. I've got to pay for that if you rip it. You probably get a discount. I get 10%. 10%. If you want it, I'll get it for you. That's nothing. It's something. I don't want the book. I just want to look at it. It's not the full retail price, OK? Guys, don't touch it too much. I'm not going to rip it. Hey. Oh, what the hell? Somebody's here. We closed 20 minutes ago. Oh, come on. Hey, I'll get rid of them. Yeah. Just gimme a second. Yeah, we weren't hurrying you. Put that book down. Put it down. Unless you're buying it, put it down. Come on. I need to get rid of these guys. Come on. Hey, guys, we closed about 20 minutes ago, so-- oh, hey! Are those guns? We don't want any trouble, man. What's going on? Don't you be giving us a hard time now. Hey. Leave her alone! Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her! What are you doing? Now, don't you be giving us no trouble, you hear? Or you're going to have to answer to her. You want to answer to her? Please. What are you going to do? All right, be quiet. Listen, shut up! We don't want any trouble, though! Just let us go. Let us go. You're all going to keep us company tonight. Besides, you're safer in here with me in and Trapper than out there. Be quiet. Please. You guys make so much noise. We won't say anything, I promise. I say we just wait. We're probably all over the news by now. Come dawn, we head to my buddy's ranch. It's secluded. He left her for me to look after when he went to Tijuana. That sounds good. So how do we get there? I've got the map right here. Please, just let us go. Please. Oh, shut up. You wait here with him. I'm going to check it out back. All right. I want you to drink from my lucky juice box. Sorry, what? What did you say? Trapper! Yo, Trapper! Trapper. You were spacing off again, weren't you? I'm sorry. What time is it? 9:27. I'm going to go get us some food from those machines back there. It's going to be a long night. You keep an eye on these fuckers right here. Got it? Got it. And if you see any more of those flesh-eating fuckers, shoot them in the head. Got it? Yeah. You don't get to tell me twice, brother. Hey, do you think I could use the restroom? I can't let you go off alone. You just heard him. Look, I have to go really bad, and if I don't go, I'll probably have an accident and you wouldn't want to deal with that all night. Please? All right, fine. You can go, but you go alone and no fucking funny business. I will, I promise. Just be careful. If you're going to go, go. I'll get us out of this. OK. Be careful. Yeah. Hey. You know that thing you wanted? What thing? Something you were just talking about. I don't know what you're talking about. You're creeping her out, man. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Oh my god, Mom, call the police. Sweetheart, are you OK? You never texted me and I-- Mom, thank god it's you. I'm being held hostage at the museum. What did you say, honey? You're breaking up on me. I can't quite hear you. Please call for help. These guys are holding us hostage and I think one of them has the virus. Is this some kind of a joke? Because I don't think-- I don't think it's very funny. Do you think I'm fucking kidding, Mom? What's going on? Sweetie? Honey? Who was that? What's going on? It's OK. Well, well, well. Look at who I have here. I gave you one fucking job. Don't make me blow out your brains like I did that last piece of shit. I'm sorry, man. It won't happen again. Don't test me. Yes, sir. Yes, Mr. President, I certainly will. And thank you for taking my call. I appreciate it. You too, sir. I need a drink. It's the only escape for me around here. You know what, why don't we play a game with these bitches? What did you have in mind? How about Simon Says? I know that's your favorite for sure. I want to go first. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Simon says pull up your dress. What's going on here? Hey. What are you doing? Shut the fuck up. I wasn't talking to you, prick face. Simon says pull up your fucking dress. Come on. Simon says, bitch. No! no! Don't do it. Please, just-- Don't make me shut you up for good. Hurry up. Yeah, yeah. There now. That wasn't so hard, was it? Sit down! Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her, please! She likes to spit. Now look what you made me do. Got me all fucked up. Leave her alone. Take me. I'll do whatever you want. Mary, no! I will! I'll do it! Mary, no! That sounds like that could be fun. That could be fun. That could be fun. I'll take the blonde. You take her. No! No! Be quiet! Be quiet. I'll have some fun with this one. Mary! Don't take too long. You know I hate sloppy seconds. Whatever you're thinking of doing, just don't do it, please! Shut that bitch up. All right. Enough of that. You know, I can give some really mean head. Want me to show you? Is that even a question? Well, whip it out, big man, and show me what I'm working with. Oh. I know you can't take it all, but try, baby. I think he got bit by one of those things. What are we going to do? Does your phone have service? Right. I left it in Mary's car. It's charging. I don't have it. Fuck! What about you? Can't you, like, radio for backup or something? This isn't even real. It's for show. What? I'm not a real cop. Oh, god. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Jose, the delivery guy. He comes 11 o'clock every night, drops off and picks up all the online orders. He's going to be here any minute. Oh. And you're sure that he'll come, right? He can save us, right? He's our only hope. OK. Man, look at the way he's going. The way he's slowly dying. If he winds up like that, we're going to wind up like that. What the fuck happened? The bitch bit my dick off! What? Don't let her get away, man! Come out, come out wherever you are, little bunny. Where are you, Mary? Mary? Where are you? Fuck. Mary, where are you? Yo, Miles. Package for you. Come on, man. Taking the Browns to the Super Bowl? Yo! It's the delivery guy. Now's your chance. Holy shit! Look outside! There's fucking zombies! They just ate the fucking delivery guy! Look! Holy shit. Spreading like the plague. Fuck! Zombies are-- they're real! There's too many of them. It's not fake news? Oh my god! I want to go home! Heather! Heather, no! Heather! God, no! Come on. No! We're never going to make it out alive. Speak for yourself. Ain't no undead fucker taking me out. What, have you got a cure? I've got the cure on me. Some experimental shit. We got it from the lab right before we found you guys. Yeah, let me see that. Fucking gun. Put your fucking hands up! Oh, the big bad security officer's going to blow my brains out, huh? That's right. I'll fucking do it. Please, officer. I'll do anything you want. What do you want, huh? Yeah, fucking put them up! Do it! Fucking-- No. I took the bullets out, you stupid piece of shit. Oh, fuck! Mary, Mary, Mary. We are here on the occasion of two brutal attacks and a triple homicide at the Valley Relics Museum. I've got Sheriff Brackett here to shed some light on the situation. Sheriff, can you tell us what happened? Well, they're all dead and they're really messed up. It's like a fucking bloodbath in there. Is it true that ex-convicts Warren Jefferson and Trapper Skinner were identified as two of the bodies that you found inside? Correct, correct. And we might have never found any of them if it wasn't for a tip from the mother of one of the victims, who we still have yet to find. But right now our main concern is finding that vaccine, and we all know that Mr. Wagner stole it from the laboratory last night, but we didn't find it on his person, and it's of utmost importance that we find that right now, because as far as we know, that's the only one that there is. A vaccine for the H37 virus. Yes, yes, and we don't know much about it, and the doctor's dead that made it, so he can't help us, so right now finding that is our only hope. Thank you, Sheriff. I think everyone watching at home is hoping and praying that you find that vaccine. Thank you. Thank you. Back to you, Nelson. Death, destruction, chaos. The city's filled with scum. Let them wipe it out. I don't care. It's time. It's time for a new world zombie order. Hello! Can anybody hear me? Hello? Is anybody out there? Hello?
