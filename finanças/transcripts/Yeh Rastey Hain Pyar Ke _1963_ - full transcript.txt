It is written in the Holy Bible that... one day Jesus Christ was passing the market place... He saw some people stoning a woman. On asking the reason, they answered that she had sinned... and they would kill her. To this Jesus said it was fine but the person who has never sinned... should cast the first stone. All of them stopped. Jesus said the greatest punishment for person who has sinned was... his repentance and tears of regret. "If the right was given to commit sin..." "let me also have the right to repent" "For my actions..." "let me have the right to be ashamed" "What good is spurning someone..." "who is already spurned?" "If the right was given to fall..." "let me also have the right to stand up on my feet" "The soul is destroyed..." "and the heart is ruined" "Now that a sin is committed..." "stop another from being committed" "Do not shut the doors..." "for a sinner" "If You will..." "help this miserable world" "In its own fire..." "the heart burns like a lamp" "Now that a sin is committed..." "stop another from being committed" "O God of the Suns and the Moons..." "I beg Thee for light" "I'm dead" "I beg Thee for another life" "Have mercy on me now" "I've endured enough misery" "Now that a sin is committed..." "stop another from being committed" "The soul is destroyed..." "and the heart is ruined" "Now that a sin is committed..." "stop another from being committed" In a dark cell, few good moments... of the past is the only hope of survival. And a man can live reminiscing these moments. Time brings about many changes in a person. Those were very strange days when I first met Nina. Bidding farewell to my heart, we went to Kashmir for a holiday. "The heart that you clap your eyes on..." "is a goner" "Whatever happens of the killer..." "God help the victim" "You enliven..." "a gathering" "Should you leave..." "the gathering disarrays" "The heart that you clap your eyes on..." "is a goner" "Whatever happens of the killer..." "God help the victim" "With a companion like you..." "who cares for the destination?" "I love the journey..." "farewell to the destination" "The heart that you clap your eyes on..." "is a goner" "Whatever happens of the killer..." "God help the victim" "I belong to you now..." "so does my boat" "I shall never look back again" "Goodbye to the shore" "The heart that you clap your eyes on..." "is a goner" "Whatever happens of the killer..." "God help the victim" The love story of Noorjehan and Jehangir was defined beautifully! And to repeat this love story over the ages... perhaps was the reason why this Nishad Baug was made. The lovers can come here... and kindle themselves in fire of their love! I have heard that the flame burns the moth... but today I cannot understand... if the flame is burning or is it the moth? If possible, try to understand who is burning whom? I am not that fortunate that the flame will burn me... every leaf of this garden can narrate my love story. Do you know that the Taj Mahal houses two lifeless bodies of... Shahjahan and Mumtaz Mahal. But you can find their spirit roaming till date, in the Shalimar Gardens. Someone asked them their names and their whereabouts. And what did they answer? They answered "The ones who are mortal go to God after death..." "but we are lovers, we live in the heart of our lover" This is Chashm-E-Shahi. Here Noorjehan asked Jehangir... whether anybody has seen a pearl that is half black and half white? To which Jehangir said that he had seen it. Noorjehan must have asked where? - Yes. And Jehangir answered that... the tears from the eyes of a beautiful maiden... which is formed while she is lining it with kohl. What reply did Noorjehan give? Noorjehan kissed Jehangir. Can I come close to you? O God, please tell Nina to belong to me! O God! Please tell Anil that I wish to belong to him forever! O God! We hope that you will shower your blessings on us! My dear, come close to me. Please!... What did you say? Think what this breeze... and this scenic beauty tell us... two young hearts kindled with love are apart from each other? Both are being consumed in the fervor of love! Come closer! "Look at the breeze and the lovely sights" "My beauty pales before theirs" "My beauty is just an illusion" "Don't fall for it" My darling... my sweetheart... Let us flow with the gentle tide of words... let our breath get intense... let us whisper sweet nothings to each other! Come closer to me! The mingling of our breath... will light up our lives! And our love will bloom, isn't it? "The fragrance of the breath and the seducing words..." "are just conspiracies of the senses" "This shower of poetry and the melodramatic music..." "will pass with the night" This silence and middle of the night... when the moon is staring at us with sleepy eyes... then why shouldn't we go ahead? Let us walk towards the horizon... let us sleep in each others arms... and let some angel find us in the wee hours of morning.... seeing our cold corpses... he showers us with the dew drops... and cover our body with it. "In the journey of love, this is my first step" "I shall go with you wherever you take me" "It's an unknown path for me, and I don't know my destination" "I'm oblivious, lead me" "I'm oblivious, lead me" Your father has come to meet you. Whenever I committed any sin, I have punished myself severely. But I never deterred from the path of truth. The religion thrives on truth, law thrives on justice... but today, a father needs his son! But father, I did not commit the murder. That night around 10 p.m., when I left the house in anger... it was raining and thundering very heavily. I've told you many times not to interfere in my personal matters. I don't like it. Ashok, do you think that I am a statue? I should listen to all your good and bad things without uttering a word? Will you always treat me like this? If you are destined for this treatment then what can I do? It doesn't matter, who treats you like this! You had promised to marry me. People like me consider it very bad to keep up to promises and loyalty. Its considered very inauspicious. I wonder which ill fated moment was it when you met Nina. That was a very fortunate moment. - Aren't you ashamed? Should you behave like this after ruining the life of a decent girl? I don't behave like this at all with decent girls! But I don't consider those girls decent, who before marriage... Let go! A wounded tigress is very dangerous, Ashok! You cannot escape her wrath! I know of many tricks, Asha. Your threats will not work on me! I will surely take my revenge! - Please go ahead. You must have come to meet Mrs Sahni. But Nina is not here! Where is Ashok? - He is drinking in his bedroom. And he is remembering Nina. Anil, you go to the police station immediately, I'll inform your father! And don't give any statement until your father reaches with a lawyer. Okay, go now! There is nothing to worry, Anil. I've engaged Mr B.K. Mukherjee, the leading lawyer in India... you tell him the truth. Anil, I will never consider Nina as my daughter-in-law... but from today, she will live in my house as my daughter! Daddy! How are you, daddy? It's been so long since you've come home. Please tell us, when will you come home? Mr Anil Kumar Sahni, the charges against you are... that, in Mumbai, on the 14th of November,... you killed Mr Ashok Srivastav in his flat at 10 p.m. Do you accept you are guilty or not? I am not guilty! No criminal accepts that he has done the crime. Your Honour and the most honourable members of the jury... I request you that after hearing this case... you give your valued opinion that the accused is guilty or not. I request the honourable members of the jury to hear this case... and give a verdict. I would like to say that murders are of 2 types. One, as per the situation, which the killer does when provoked... the sentence for this is not for many years. And the other is premeditated. That means, committing a murder with a proper planning. And the killer gets a death penalty for this crime. Members of the jury... I represent this case as the prosecution lawyer... and will fight the case against the accused. And my honourable friend, Mr Mukherjee... who has been specially called from Calcutta for this case... and he is even known for releasing the criminals... will fight the case for the accused as his defense lawyer. My friend and I share a very long and old association... he tries his best to kill people and I save them! Irrespective if the accused is a criminal or not, you will save him! Irrespective if the accused is innocent, you'll surely sentence him! I beg your pardon. Honorable members of the jury, this is a case of murder. The occurrence is very clear and simple. With the occurrence one thing is proved, the murder surely took place. And Anil committed this murder. Anil Sahni is a pilot of a high grade. He has also represented India in the hockey matches at international levels He was victimized by the licentious nature of his wife... and was provoked to kill his friend, Ashok Srivastav. Anil went to Ashok's flat at Carmichael Road at 10 p.m. And few minutes later, there were gun shots heard from that place. And Ashok died! And the story of revenge and vengeance which has been repeating... from the times of Adam and Eve, was repeated once again! I would like to present few witnesses. First witness is Kewal Kapoor... from whose house the revolver was stolen. Mr Kewal Kapoor, the friend of the accused, Anil Sahni. Since how many years do you know the accused? As far as my memory is concerned... my mother used to say that we were born on the same day. It was during Diwali, he was born bravely and I came out with fright! I asked you since how long do you know Anil Sahni? I did say that we were born together, we played together... we went to college at the same time and took up the job together. He was brave, he became a pilot, I was a coward, I became an assistant. What do you know of the relations between Ashok and Anil Sahni's wife? We all frequented Ashok's house. We met almost every evening in the club or at his house. Did the accused ever speak to you about his wife and Ashok's relationship? You really are strange! Excuse me... but if my wife or your wife had relations with late Ashok... then would we publicize it amongst our other friends? Then what would we do? - We would drown with shame! And if that was no solution then? Then we would do the same as Anil! In the court, a witness is asked for his statement, not for his opinion. Okay tell us what transpired on the night of 14th November? On night of 14th November, 11 p.m., I was dancing in Hotel Natraj. Anil came to me, he was very scared and he took me out. He said that he was perhaps dead. When I asked him who he said that the scoundrel Ashok was dead. What else did Anil say? - He said that... in his nervousness, he left my revolver at his place. When I was surprised he told me that he had taken it from my house. What were you doing when he took your revolver? I was exercising at that time. That means Anil stole your revolver? Yes, he stole my revolver. Where did you keep your revolver? There is a life size picture of Lord Hanuman in my room... I used to hide my revolver behind that. Behind Lord Hanuman's picture? - Yes, why is it a sin to do that? I guess you are a devotee of Hanuman? - Yes, ask me why? Why? - After Lord Ram, only Hanuman had... the power to destroy Ravan. I think He can save me from any grave problems Please tell me, when Lord Hanuman shot at Ravan... What are you saying? There were no bullets then, they used bow and arrows and swords. Then as per current laws, don't you know that... you must keep a gun in a safe place and not hide it behind a picture? I felt that there was no better safe place than Lord Hanuman's picture. Because, I have never seen anyone with the same sense of duty as Hanuman. You can read the Ramayan. - I will surely read it. But when you had entrusted the duty of the revolver to Lord Hanuman... then what was the fear, do you exercise to increase your energy? Yes, if you read Ramayan you'll know Hanuman was the master of exercises! And there is a picture of Lord Hanuman in all wrestling arenas. And all the wrestlers exercise in front of his picture? Yes, they even scream "Hail Lord Hanuman, make the enemy weak!" And that day, were you exercising in front of Hanuman's picture... and saying the same things? Yes, I was exercising and imploring to Lord Hanuman! Mr Kewal Kapoor was shouting in front of Lord Hanuman's picture... and in front of his eyes, Mr Anil Sahni stole his revolver... and he didn't even see it. Glory to Lord Hanuman! Mr Ram Singh, the chef of Ashok Srivastav. Is your name Ram Singh? - Yes, sir. My father's name is G. Singh and my grandfather's name is Ajit Singh. That's it! Where do you stay? Nainital. What did you do at Mr Ashok's place? - I cooked. Okay, now tell everyone what happened on the night of 14th November? I was in the kitchen when my master called me. He told me to fry few almonds and cashew nuts. I went inside... when I suddenly heard some gun shots. I ran towards the master's room... I saw that my master was shot... and this man was leaving the place. You said that every evening your master asked you to fry nuts for him. Yes, sir. - Did he have them with tea or coffee? He never drank tea or coffee, he always had whiskey. Did he drink whiskey alone? No sir, with women. Ram Singh, do you know the names of those women? I don't know their names but I know the food they ate. What food did you cook for them? - For the Christian women... I cooked ham and turkey. And for the Hindu women I cooked spinach and vegetables. And I cooked chicken and mutton for the Muslim girls. Is Mr Mukherjee defending his client, or trying to hook a cook for himself? You can ask the witness only questions relating to this case. The relation is Ashok Srivastav's specific interest, as Ram Singh said... was with women and this has a very deep connection with this case. When your master used to talk with women, were you always in the kitchen? Even I have a girlfriend, she is very nice, sir. I'm going to marry her. - That's a very good news, Ram Singh. If your master also felt the same then perhaps he wouldn't be murdered. Aspersions are being cast at the deceased Ashok Srivastav's character. Was the same girl with you the night your boss was killed? Try to remember. Yes sir, I remember. It was raining and lightning heavily. And we both were very scared. And was someone with your master? - Madam Asha! Did you see? - When I was taking the nuts inside... they were fighting. He asked her to get out and she told him to shut up! I got scared and returned to my kitchen. Then I and my dame had a swill each. Then I pushed her out through the back door. After that? - After that I heard the gun shots. You just said that there was thundering and lightning... so the noise that you heard was it the gun shot or the lightning? There was thundering but I did hear the gun shots too! But how could you hear the gun shots amidst this noise? I just heard it. - Perhaps, by then... the lightning and thundering stopped? Yes, sir. So that you could hear the gun shots clearly? Yes, sir... no, sir! It must have been a coincidence, sir. Very good. A coincidence. Your Honour, members of the jury, it was a coincidence! Mr Ali Khan, all this was a coincidence! Ms Asha. Where were you on the night of murder, Ms Asha? I was in Ashok's flat. What were you doing there? - He was my fiance. We were going to get married. I used to go to his house often. And that night too, I went there. What happened that night? - When I was returning from there... Mr Anil entered Ashok's house in a very angry mood. He had a revolver in his hand and when I asked him the reason... he said that he wanted to kill Ashok. I tried to stop him but he did not listen to me. And he entered Ashok's bedroom and closed the door. After sometime, I heard few gun shots. The door opened and Mr Anil ran out. And then you went into the room and saw Ashok's dead body? Since there was no light in the flat and the building... I found Ashok dead after sometime. And close to him was Anil's revolver. Ms Asha, since when do you know Mr Ashok Srivastav? Since 3 years. - How did you meet him the first time? There was a New Year eve dance in CCI and even I had been there. Ashok asked me for a dance and I agreed. After the dance, he gave me his card and asked me to visit him. And you visited him? - Yes. Because, he insisted that I should visit him. Ms Asha, do you go so easily on the first invitation itself? Of course not! - Then how come you... went to Ashok Srivastav's house? Because I liked him a lot. - Because, you found him rich. This is wrong. - It is true! Asha, agreed that you did not go there because he is rich... but you went there because you liked that man. It could be possible that he really was a good man. But I don't know how you thought in one meeting that he was a nice man? God has bestowed every person with a little sense of thinking... by which he can differentiate between good and bad. That's exactly what I was thinking that in 10 minutes flat... you can analyze a person's character... but it's surprising that in 4 months, you couldn't understand the woman... who cheated you and snatched away your fiancee from you? That's because she was married. And I always thought that... she would never have such intentions for another man. Why don't you clearly say Nina Sahni is more beautiful than you? Beautiful? I have been honoured Miss Mumbai. Ashok's nature was such, he would get enticed by any new woman. And you, I beg your pardon, had become quite old for him! Agreed that she was not better looking than you... neither did your charm wear off from him... but you yet noticed that Ashok was attracted to Nina Sahni. Yes, they would meet clandestinely without my knowledge. When I couldn't bear this anymore, I fought with Ashok. It had a bad effect, in anger he threatened to break the engagement. But I did not agree. - Why didn't you break the engagement? What was the reason for which you could not sever your ties with him? Jealousy, greed, obsession? No! I loved Ashok! I did not want to leave him! I wanted him to belong only to me and nobody else! Mr Mukherjee has no right to ask questions... which are not related with this case. And to rub salt over the wounds of a girl jilted in love! It is a sin for me to rub salt over someone's wounds then... but to hang an innocent man is a very good deed according to my friend! Anyway Asha, as you just said... you loved Ashok so much that you could not leave him. No wonder you went to his flat every evening... I mean how was your love? Was it platonic love, a clean relationship or...? My friend should be ashamed to ask such questions. I am feeling ashamed, Mr Ali Khan. "You will feel embarrassed if I narrate the tales of the night" You were right, Mr Khan. Forget whatever happened last night! But there is one thing. Asha, you are the last person... who saw Ashok Srivastav alive that night. Can you tell me... The last person who saw Ashok alive... was not me, it was Mr Anil. I mean, you were the first woman who saw Ashok's dead body. No, Mr Anil was the first man who saw Ashok's dead body. You came well prepared to the court! You don't know me very well, I am always well prepared for anything! Can I prepare some dinner for you? That day is not very far but today, I am not ready. As you wish! I have stated that Ashok Srivastav was shot on his temple... and he died due to that. I state that the revolver had the fingerprints of the accused. Why did father shoot Ashok uncle? The boys in my school say that he loved mother. But even I love mother and father approves of it. Even I love her, isn't it mother? But father doesn't tell me anything! How I wish I was also a child like you both! Raibahadur Gyanchand Sahni, the father of the accused. Raibahadur, is it true that this marriage was against your wishes? Yes, but every father is responsible for his son's good and bad deeds. That means, a father is trying to hold himself responsible... and save his son at any cost? My dear friend, when you are trying to hang someone's son on the noose... then what is the problem if the father is trying to save his son? Mrs Nina Sahni, wife of the accused. Since how many years are you married? 7 years. Was it a love marriage? - Yes. In the last 7 years, did your husband ever give you a reason to complain? No. - Did you regret leaving France... and settling in India? - No. My father was an Indian and I loved my father a lot. That is why I always prayed that I should also get an Indian husband. Mr Sahni, since when do you know Ashok Srivastav? Since past one year, Ashok was Anil's close friend. He knew Anil since many years and had gone to America for business. When he came back around a year back, I met him. When did you meet Ashok Srivastav for the first time? At Ashok's flat, next day Anil was leaving the town for 4 months. And Ashok had thrown a party in his honour. As far as I remember, it was the first time I had liquor in that party. And that too, I was forced to do so. Because, along with Ashok, Anil was also pressurizing me. So that his friend should not feel offended. This depends on you, if possible, go ahead and convince her. Darling, tonight is a very eventful night. Tomorrow I am going for four months. - Four months? That means, 120 days! I request you Mrs Sahni... for his happiness, I beg you to drink! "I am fortunate that I can share these few moments" "For tomorrow, we do not know where we are" Please. Go on... drink so much that every sip makes Anil happy! Ashok, please look after Nina and the children. You need not tell me, they won't even realise how these 4 months passed by. They will just fly past! I consider this very unauspicious! That someone is leaving and his dear ones are shedding tears. Love is in the heart, not in the eyes. The path of love is very fragile. One has to carefully tread on it. Now you will see one more trick. Even an animal cannot tolerate... injustice meted out on beauty! Give me your hand! The dog will come to save you when you are in trouble! Come... Sit down! "In these paths of love..." "tread very carefully" "What ruins your heart here..." "is your own unruly passion" "In these paths of love..." "tread very carefully" "One who walks on these paths..." "never returns" "If ever he returns..." "all he brings with him is despair" "He shall spend the rest of his life..." "like someone with lost identity" "Such are the paths of love" "Tread very carefully" "What I considered..." "was a lamp of my heart..." "when I went up close..." "it turned out to be a bane to my heart" "Should you try to be a firefly..." "you end up getting burnt" "In these paths of love..." "tread very carefully" "What ruins your heart here..." "is your own unruly passion" What are you doing tomorrow? - I am going for shopping tomorrow. Alone? - Anil has gone out of town. It's a sin for a woman to shop alone and I cannot bear this sin! I will get my car but I have a condition. Tell me. - You will have to get the kids along. Who is it? You? - Any doubts? At this hour? - When the night falls... it looks even more beautiful! Sleeping in the wee hours of morning is considered a crime for men like me! What do you think? Why are you so scared? Let me light my pipe, only then can I talk! I came here with some important work. With me? - With you? Yes, I think it is with you. Sometimes you tend to forget important things. In the morning the children insist on some things, you apologize to them... and I have to go through the trouble. You had bought chocolates for your children... and you left them in my car, see this! Take this too! I am sorry for the trouble. - You went through the trouble. No, this is my good fortune. I wish that... I mean, I hope you'll keep on troubling me this way! And if you... A small frown on your forehead tells me that... something is troubling you... and you are missing your husband who has gone abroad! Two thoughts are troubling me today. Two thoughts? What are they? One before you came into my life and one after you left? It's a lovely poem, I have forgotten the first stanza. Sir, the first stanza goes like this... "There have been only two moments in my life..." "one before you came into my life and one after you left" Yes. There are many days left for Anil to arrive back. Our wedding anniversary and Anil's birthday are approaching. That's great, congratulations! Please accept my good wishes twice! You will experience these good moments often. But perhaps, I'll never be fortunate enough to experience this ever! If you permit me then please let me organise a grand party in this honour! But I don't know many people around. The sad part is that you have yet not known me very well! And neither do you know yourself! Permit me to introduce you to thousands who know you well! If a man gets even one moment of happiness in his life... then he feels proud of his destiny. But today, with great luck, two good moments have come together... Anil's birthday and your wedding anniversary! Please! After this day, this piano will surely take pride in its good fortune. But I have come here to recommend something. For this drink, which is dying to meet with your lips! What is this, Ashok? - Don't ask this on an auspicious day. It's considered as a bad omen. I'm not offering liquor to a person who can intoxicate with her looks! Trust me, I cannot be so audacious! Please take! Please! Drink in such a way that every sip makes Anil happy! "Look at my life..." "tonight it sways in euphoria" "I wonder where it is taking me" "I'm not alone in my journey" "My heart is my companion" "I..." "pass by..." "yet not a path I find" "Even in dust I find light..." "that burn me" "O Life, where are you?" "Someone is calling me..." "from afar" "I step ahead..." "towards him with pride" "My heart is ecstatic" "My eyes too have lit up" "Though, I don't see a lamp anywhere" "My path is strewn with roses" "Stars twinkle before my eyes" "Do not call me now..." "I'm drowning in passion" "I'm not in my senses" "Stunned, I ask myself..." "where I am headed" "Look at my life..." "tonight it sways in euphoria" "I wonder where it is taking me" Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother. Postman, Madam. "Nina, this night is the most beautiful night of our lives." "I wish I was with you..." "but you aren't away from me, you live in my heart!" That night was the most horrible night of my life! Who could be a better trust worthy friend than Ashok? But I didn't know that nobody was worth trusting in this dishonest world You mean that one shouldn't trust a conniving man like Ashok Srivastav? For how many years did you live in Paris? For 20 years, I was born and brought up there. Obviously you completed your education there. Yes. - Mrs Sahni, is it true that... right from school days in Paris... the girls start having affairs and openly display it in public places? It is a special place, only the affluent visit the clubs there... or the tourist from other countries frequent that place. Ordinary people don't go there. So it's true that their lifestyle is different from ours? Yes, and it should be that way. Sure. Out there a woman can smoke and drink with a strange man. And if she's bored with her husband, she can enjoy herself with a stranger. And if she gets bored even with that then she can divorce her husband. Such things are not considered immoral there. What I mean to say is they don't have as many restrictions as us. Right? Yes, there is lot of difference in the lifestyles of both the places. Which lifestyle do you like? You perhaps didn't hear, Mrs Sahni, I asked which lifestyle do you like? Your silence says that the woman who spent 20 years of her life... in the romantic evenings of Paris... then how can she lead a happy life with an Indian husband? In your statement you have said that in Anil's absence... you used to accompany Ashok to clubs and dances. I am very sure that... in the matter of drinking too, you used to give him company. Mrs Sahni said in her statement that she had liquor for the first time. And that too, because she was forced by Ashok Srivastav. Mr Mukherjee, you cannot object to the questions connected with this case. Mrs Sahni, are you trying to say that... at the wedding anniversary party that was hosted in your house... inspite of knowing that you don't drink... did Ashok force you to drink? Yes. - You mean, he tied you with a rope... or he compelled you in some other way, he forcibly opened your mouth... and pushed it down your throat? I did not say that. - Then what do you mean by force? I mean, I was compelled to drink. Mrs Sahni, the glass from which you had the liquor... whose glass was it? - Mine! And whose hands took the glass to your lips? Mine! And who put the liquor down your throat? I did! - Then how was it forced on you? I mean, he insisted that I drink. So you think that force and insisting mean the same? Can Mr Mukherjee tell me if these two words mean the same? You perhaps forget that you are cross examining her, not me. If you really want to know then, I am at your service after the court. I am warning you both that this is court and not a public gathering. Do you consider drinking alcohol bad? I think it is very bad for a woman to drink. Despite considering alcohol bad... you had it because Ashok forced and insisted you to have it. Yes. - When on his forcing... you could do one bad deed, then...? - What are you trying to say? I am trying to say that you encouraged Ashok! This is a lie! If this was the case then why would I tell Anil about it? Because you had no other alternative. Anil came back suddenly and you knew that he had learnt everything... you created a fictitious story of your innocence... you held that man responsible for all your sins... whom you called a conspirator! This is a lie, I told Anil the truth. Ashok cheated me! Could be. Mrs Sahni, you knew Ashok since four months. Isn't it right that you got a chance to get close to him in this period? Mrs Sahni, you are an educated and an intelligent lady... are you trying to tell the jury that for 4 months, he forced you and... you did not realise his intentions? Mrs Sahni, your lover is dead and everything is out in open now. You are trying to prove that you are a loyal wife... because there's nobody else besides your husband to look forward to. My dear friend is forgetting that the court is a place of high regard... and he shouldn't talk such cheap things and show his true colours. What is left to prove anyway? Since how many years have you been married? Seven years. - And how was your domestic life... in these seven years? The same as any other decent man. I was happy with life. What do you feel about women's liberation? I feel that a man and a woman should have equal freedom. But that doesn't mean that we take undue advantage of that freedom. Sometimes, outdated thoughts can make life difficult. And sometimes, extra freedom can also create complications. Mr Sahni, does your wife also share the same views? Yes. When I met her for the first time... and studied her nature... I learnt that we shared a lot in common. The accused's ideas about his wife are wrong. Because, she a very liberated woman who is quite ahead of times. Like the women in the west. Mr Khan, how many western girls have you been in love with? Mr Mukherjee, you cannot object such questions. Mr Mukherjee, to make an omelette, it is necessary to see that... whether the egg is good or not. Nobody looks at the hen. I don't know what you do in Bengal... but to know a woman it's not necessary to love her. In this period of 7 years, did you notice any change in your wife? Only this time when I returned back from Europe. Father is back! Father is back! I had everything there, only you were missing. Look at this. Father, there are two men pursuing one woman? Yes, child. - Then with whom will she dance? The one she likes. - Yes, the one whom she likes. This is your pistol? - Is it a real one, father? Absolutely real. - Then on whom shall I use it? You will not find a better target than me, come on shoot me. On you? - Pawan is scared. I am not scared. All my desires have been fulfilled... the only desire is that I should die at your feet. There was a time when someone else killed me,... today the children are repeating the same performance. Why are you looking so sad? If someone has cast an evil eye then I shall ward off the evil spell. If someone has smiled at you then I shall snatch off his smiles. I've got you a precious gift which my love will express after 300 years. Did my queen like it? My dear, I want an answer. I'm pleased, my queen but you cannot be the queen to the whole world. I swear upon this beautiful Taj, if anyone dares to look at you... then either one of us shall be alive. You don't seem to be in a good mood today. How are you feeling? - You think of fooling all the time. I'm speaking to you with respect and you are forgetting the formalities? Okay, I deserve that. Anil, you are acting like a child today. Remember Nina, you always said that there were 3 children in our house. Keep quiet... How can a devotee be quiet in front of his Goddess? Today is my day. Today, I will kill myself with my own hands. Today, I shall adorn my Goddess with my own hands. Anil, you go outside, I will dress up and come. I can let you get away with murder. At the sight of you... I forget everything but you I don't know... if I'm alive or dead Darling, this telephone is like my rival. Let's go out somewhere. Go and start the car, I'll get the phone. Shall I shoot you? Mother, Pawan shot at me. I am dead now, goodbye. Mother, look at my house before you leave. Your table is there. - I think you are looking... for someone else, Jameel. - I am sorry, sir. I must have made a mistake. You are not the same one. But Nina, how do you know his name? I am the famous poet, Jameel Lucknowi. I work as a waiter in the day and write poetry in the night. Madam had attended one of my concerts. I've written a famous poem which is almost similar as Mirza Ghalib's... but it gained a lot of recognition. It goes as... "This ignorance is not accidental, Jameel..." "there is surely something that is kept under wraps" How peacefully they both are sleeping. They are oblivious of the world... but once they grow up, they will understand everything. At that time, what will I tell them, what will the world tell them? And what will they understand themselves? Anil, I wish to tell you something. Don't tell me, Nina. Probably, I won't be able to bear it. I shudder with the thought when I look at your scared expression... which is in dilemma and is trying to hide and also tell me everything. I feel that there is darkness around me. And I am standing at the edge of a deserted cliff. Anil, please save me, please don't let me fall. Save me! Nina, you are fortunate that you can at least cry. Look at me, the tears have been snatched from my eyes... and also the smile from my lips. Promise me that you will never leave me alone now. I did not stay without you even for a moment. Every moment, you were with me. Whenever I looked at the blue clouds while flying the plane... I could see only you. Listen, Nina. One day, a terrible storm hit... but I told the storm that nobody can deter me... because, my Nina would be waiting for me. Listen to me, Anil. Nina, I shudder at the thought that you are trying to tell me something. Please tell me that you don't want to tell me anything. Anil, I will not be able to sleep peacefully without telling you. And I will not be able to live if I hear it. I plead to you for one night. This may perhaps, be the last night of my good fortune. Please go to sleep, Nina. "Your tresses swayed..." "and made my life" "Worth watching..." "was the picture of love that came through" "Every time the evening shadows..." "grew cooler..." "the glow on your face..." "would keep me warm" "Whenever bad times..." "struck me..." "those sparkling eyes..." "would pull me together" "Should someone ask me..." "what you mean to me..." "I'd say, you are..." "a beautiful prayer of my love" "What my heart..." "prayed for..." "you are the first blessing..." "of love I received" "Should someone ask me..." "what you mean to me..." "Even music..." "envies you" "Such is your melody that resonates..." "in the valleys of my heart" "Should someone ask me..." "what you mean to me..." "If my life..." "is a garden in bloom..." "my love..." "you are the easterly breeze" "Should someone ask me..." "what you mean to me..." "I'd say, you are..." "a beautiful prayer of my love" "Why is today my life in a mess?" "I've seen..." "many a Taj Mahal break" "I never imagined..." "the breeze would kick up a storm" "I never imagined..." "her tresses would turn into serpents" "Your face doesn't give me warmth anymore" "There's no sign of fidelity in your eyes either" "Should someone ask me..." "what you mean to me..." "I'd say, you are one..." "who betrayed me, ruined me in love" "The song of love that was never ever composed..." "you are that affliction" "What sweetly cheats the eyes..." "you are that beautiful, false intoxication" "Ask your heart at least..." "who you belong to. Me?" "Or, are you another's beloved?" "Should someone ask me..." "what you mean to me..." "I'd say, you are one..." "who betrayed me, ruined me in love" "You are infidel" "You are unfaithful" No, Anil! I have been infidel to you. I have fallen in my own eyes, Anil. My honour has been disgraced. Nobody can wipe it. Nobody can wipe it. How is Pawan? - I haven't thought about him. And Rita? - My heart sinks at the thought of it. Nina? I mean, how is the mother of your children? How can you even ask? - What else do you want me to ask? Ask me why I did not kill her yet? - Yes. I love Nina. - Then? I don't know what I should do. - It's very simple. If you want to commit a murder then you can borrow someone's gun. If not that, then... - Then what? I told you not to become a pilot but you became. I told you not to get married to her but you did. Now, once try listening to me, for Rita and Pawan's sake... forgive the mother of your children. You may get many women but you will not get a mother to Rita and Pawan. Daddy is back! Daddy is back! Daddy, what is on your face? - I fell down, child. You fell down? - Yes, Pawan. You daddy has fallen from a very great height. Inspite of being so grown up, how could you fall? We all keep on falling all the time, isn't it, father? I've never seen mother falling. Mother, you be with father all the time, when he falls down, help him. I know that perhaps you will never be able to live with me again. Besides, I cannot even tell you anything. I don't deserve you anymore. How can I tell you that I am Pawan and Rita's mother. Anil, please tell them that their mother is dead. Take care of them and make them understand. If they get obstinate then please don't ever hit them. I have raised my children with a lot of love. After you separate from me... you may perhaps get married again. But please don't keep the children away from you. You understand and make the children also understand... that you are their mother as well as their father. Where can I go if I leave Pawan... Rita and you? My world is here. How will I live alone if I go away from here? Your fault is, probably you can't forgive me without committing this sin And my fault is that I will never be able to forgive you. But... what has Rita done? Pawan's not at fault either. For their sake, we will have to live together... even if we may be dead for each other. Anil, the biggest punishment for a sin is the weight of that sin. I wish I could speak to you about my feelings. Please forgive me. It is very easy to ask for forgiveness, Nina. But only the person who forgives knows how it feels. Will you never forgive me? Deserted love can be balmed with two words of sympathy. A broken heart can be mended with the tears of remorse. A man can perhaps get back to life after his death. But this fragile bond of love which is based on trust and beliefs... can never be joined back again once it is broken. Fate has taken me away from you that... I may never be able to get close again. Even if you get close, those desires will never come again... which left with you. They are dead and buried forever. I am dead for you and you are dead for me. "So tranquil" "Such privacy" "The world of love..." "is so young" "So tranquil" "Such privacy" "The world of love..." "is so young" "In this winter..." "my body shivers" "Is it snow?

"is so young" When I see the tears in your eyes... and start thinking that these tears are the reminder of a sin... I feel ashamed of myself. Mrs Singh is expected, I tried to avoid her but she wouldn't listen. These tears may be very valuable for someone else... but they are absolutely worthless for me. I said that there are guests expected at home. Why did you do it, Nina? What was the charisma without which, you could not survive? Was that charisma more attractive than Rita... more innocent than Pawan or more sacred than my love? We must at least behave properly with our guests. My enemy would also not behave with me the way you have, Nina. He would only kill me. But you've wounded me in such a way that it doesn't let me live or die. When a man dies, his sins are forgiven. No Nina, I cannot forgive you. I can do anything but I cannot forgive you. I stayed away from home for 4 months, any change could have occurred... you or I could have died... but my love could have never died. Do you love him? Does he love you? Anil, I don't know anything. Then you should die. Then you should die. Nina, you should die. Then you should die. Father, leave her. Leave my mother or I shall shoot you. Please forgive me, son. After that? - After that, I thought... that I should meet Ashok. Because my Nina started feeling that she was not fit for me and I couldn't bear to see her that way. But when Nina learnt that I was going to meet Ashok... she tried to stop me, she was scared that I may have a fight with Ashok. And he would shoot me but I did not listen to her. On the way I realised my friend, Kewal Kapoor's house was nearby. I went there and asked for his revolver. And went to Ashok's place. Asha opened the door and seeing me, she said something very cheap... but I did not answer her back. And I went straight away to Ashok's room. He was in the room, and I asked him what he thinks of my Nina. He asked me what I thought. I told him that I love Nina. That rogue told me that even he loves Nina a little bit. I told him that a friend's wife is like a sister. But that debauch man gave me a very cheap answer. He said that I was not only the one to have rights on this relationship. After all its a matter of the heart and he can fall in love with anyone. In a rage, I pulled out my revolver. I forgot to tell you that it was raining very heavily that night. It was thundering and lightning... A major lightning struck, the electricity went off... and Ashok tried to grab my revolver. And thus, a fight broke out between both of us. 2-3 bullets were fired from my revolver but it did not injure anyone. In the course of this fight, the revolver dropped from my hands. And in a split moment, Ashok went away from me. The lightning struck again and I saw that... the revolver was in Ashok's hand, he was about to shoot me... when I leaped on him and caught his hand. The lightning struck again and another shot was fired. There was some more thundering and he was shot in his head. And he perhaps died. Mr Sahni, are you sure that Ashok Srivastav fired the bullet? Yes, I am very sure about that bullet. When that bullet was shot, the revolver was in Ashok's grip. And I was trying to save my life. Which religion do you follow? Hinduism. Then you must have surely read the Ramayan. Yes. - Then you must be knowing that... when Ravan, kidnaped Lord Ram's wife, Sita... and when Lord Ram learnt about it, he attacked Ravan and killed him. Yes. You think what Lord Ram did was right? - Yes. According to you, a husband should kill such a man? But my intention of going to Ashok's place was not that. If your intention was not that then why did you take a revolver? To protect myself. I thought if a man can ruin a decent woman's honour... can even shoot at me. - Great presence of mind. On one hand, you felt that you may lose control over yourself. And on the other hand, you even took care of your safety? You can say anything you want. - Anil, you were taking guarded steps. You were not scared at all. This is not true. In fear, man cannot focus on more than one thing at a time. Your statement is a beautiful tale... which after the murder, was a brain work of an intelligent mind. Thank you Mr Khan for appreciating my intelligent mind. Mr Sahni, why were you upset? - For the sake of my honour. Don't you know that no man can successfully dishonour a woman... until and unless a woman does not participate in it? I would like to remind my friend that this case is regarding a murder... it's not a case of adultery committed by the accused's wife. I beg your pardon but I said because, the court's time shouldn't be wasted... but there is no doubt that my friend is himself defaming a woman's honour. I mean, by levying such accusations. Your Honour, my friend needs to be told that sometimes... he should learn to be patient, which of course is against his nature. You went to Ashok's place to speak with him. Yes. In such a stormy weather? Such a night was very conducive for murder. This is not true. - No, it is. If you were so keen on speaking with him then... after you spoke to your wife, you would have immediately... gone there and asked him the reason for all this? But you did no such thing, you first thought about it... planned it out, managed to get a revolver... then you went to Ashok's house and killed that unarmed man. Mr Sahni, a man who is upset cannot think of such a plan. You are a murderer. - No, I am not! I have not murdered anybody. Please understand, in our fight, the bullets were fired accidentally. Mr Sahni, we have no such proof on the basis of which we know that... the gun fired automatically. The revolver cannot be shot until the trigger is not pressed. And until there is no pressure put on the trigger, it doesn't work. and the pressure is not built until the trigger is not gripped properly. Mr Sahni, the bullet wasn't fired with the air pressure. But in fight, the revolver can be fired with hand movements. I understand Mr Sahni that you are a sharpshooter. But in a fight of 1 1/2 minute, how many times can a revolver be fired? All this means that... you gruesomely killed your friend, Ashok in a very professional manner. I did not kill anyone! - All killers say the same. The bullets were fired accidentally. This is an old story. - I am not a killer! I'm not! Why are you shouting so loudly? That's because, you have killed Ashok, you are his murderer. If there is a display of disorder in the court... then besides the people connected with this case... nobody else will be allowed in the courtroom. I have tolerated enough. Don't you also believe Anil's statement? I feel Anil is saying the truth. But nobody knows the truth. The court asks for evidences. There is nothing that can identify truth from deceit. And the evidences are against Anil. Do you love Anil a lot? I can do anything for Anil, even give up my life. Then listen to me, I shall ask for the permission to call you again. And... Do you remember, you stated that... you met Ashok Srivastav the first time in his flat? Yes. - You had lied. You met Ashok Srivastav the first time in Europe. No. - I can prove that... you came to India for him... and by force of habit, when he refused to marry you,... you got married to Anil Sahni, isn't this is the truth? Well, I... You could not forget Ashok even after your marriage. And when you saw that he wants to love you but marry Asha... you told your husband, Anil everything to seek your revenge. Because, you were aware that no man can tolerate this. He would lose control and kill that person. Isn't this the truth? I want an answer Mrs Sahni. Yes, I wanted that Ashok should belong only to me and nobody else. I wanted that Ashok should belong only to me and nobody else! In order to save me, if you need to make her say all this... then your honour, I would like to say that I have killed Ashok. What are you doing? - I am right, I have killed Ashok. What are you trying to prove? - I can kill him many more times. I am trying to save you and... I told you even before that you need complete rest. Any kind of excitement can prove to be dangerous for you. You will not go to the court tomorrow. At least think about your children, Mrs Sahni. This world is a very strange place, doctor. Neither does it let you live nor does it let you die. I would like Mr Mukherjee to present the case in the accused's defense. This accused is amongst the people for whom their house is a temple... the wife is the Goddess of that temple and... the children are the lamps of that temple. And this accused is amongst the people who love their devotion... and gain a spiritual satisfaction with their devotion. If such a devotee learns that the woman whom he considers a Goddess... has been tainted by a devotee of lust... then no self-respecting man can stay silent. Yes, he acted very patiently... he gave a chance to his friend that he can improve himself. But that man was not willing to do so. When there is a bout between deceit and truth, the truth is overshadowed. When the weak and strong men fight, the weak man attacks first. This is the law of nature and... this is exactly what transpired between both of them. There was a deadly fight between the good and the bad... and nature could not be silent. To end the evil and to help the good prevail... the revolver was shot by the hands of the good... which in legal language is called accident. We may not accept this decision of nature but to held the accused... responsible for this accident, will be a great injustice on our part. Members of the jury, my dear friend is trying to prove... that the accused planned out the murder. He is trying to say that the accused sought... his revenge by killing the man who ruined his house. But when you announce your decision patiently... you will realise yourself that this helpless man... was just dreaming of saving his house from destruction. He was trying to save it from falling apart. And to keep his children alive, he was trying to extinguish... the fire within him with his own blood. Members of the jury, if the law of this country believes that... the innocent should be let free... then to safeguard this law and to respect the judicial system... Anil Kumar Sahni, should be let out free. If he is punished then the people who spread evil... on the basis of power and wealth will celebrate. Innocent women will be victimized by such evil men. And our pure principals will perish in that unholy fire. Members of jury, Anil Kumar Sahni is not guilty. He has not committed any offense in the eyes of the world and law. If any man who has done an offense, is his friend Ashok Srivastav... and his debauch acts. You just heard the famous lawyer, Mr Mukherjee present... a defense case in favour of the accused. And See him... And while the presentation was being made, I was thinking... that am I hearing a presentation of a lawyer in the court... or am I watching a good actor's performance on the stage? But members of the jury, this is not a hermitage of the saints... this is not a stage of a theater, this is a courtroom. Here the decision is not announced seeing the accused's character,... his innocent face, his grand uniform... or the status he commands in the society. Its made on basis of the evidences and statements presented in the court. The basic rule of law is that no man can kill anyone... or take the law in his hands. Members of the jury, we are not concerned with... what the accused was and what he is. We are only concerned with what the accused did and what he didn't. My friend even accepts that after the accused spoke with his wife... took a revolver and headed towards Ashok's house. He even says that only with the intention of speaking,... the accused went to Ashok's place. Members of jury, note this point, he went with a revolver to speak. He wants us to believe that one man... after hearing about the debauchery committed by his wife... went to that man's house only to speak, that too, with a revolver. And Anil did not kill Ashok intentionally. He himself died because of his misfortune. Just due to his misfortune. My friend accepts that there was a fight. But the question that arises is that if there was a fight... then whose fingerprints were on the revolver? As per the report of the fingerprint experts... the revolver had only the fingerprints of the accused. After this, there is no scope for any doubt... that the revolver was shot by the accused and that too, intentionally. Members of the jury, the law and justice of this country... and the judicial system of this country is under scrutiny. Not only my friend, Mr Mukherjee and I... the accused and his relatives... but every person in this country is anxiously waiting for the judgment. Members of the jury, if the accused is pronounced not guilty... then the walls of this judicial system will start cracking. And instead of expecting law and justice in this court... the future generation will run away from this system. That's why, it should be remembered, one who marks this date in history... should not be ashamed at the mention of this case. My friend has said that the innocent one should be set free. Even I share the same opinion that the innocent one should be freed. But members of the jury, the person guilty should be punished... to respect justice and to uphold the law, the guilty should be punished And Anil is guilty. Now you've lost the case, before you leave, can I invite you for dinner? I think I'll wait for you in the library. Yes, and even I think that I should accept her invitation. Go ahead. Thank you, but can I know... after the death of your every would-be husband... you invite strangers at home? Should I assume that this time it is my turn? Forget about that old story. But one thing is incomplete. If Anil Sahni would understand my question... then at least he would be saved from the noose. Not all desires are fulfilled, Mr Mukherjee. Even Ashok died with the desire of possessing Nina. Yes, you said the right thing... either Ashok should belong to you or to nobody else. Do you remember saying this? - Well... yes. Like Nina, even you are fond of digging up old graves. Individual liking, Ms Asha. Some like to save lives, and some like to take lives. Yes, Mr Ali? - Still trying to save Anil's life? Well, that is... - By tomorrow... his death sentence will be announced. - I think the same, but Mr Ali... I would like to see the place where Ashok was killed. But you are having dinner with me? - We'll have dinner after that... you can also accompany us. - But corpses do not speak. Ali, you know that I like to make the corpses speak. Are you scared? - No. One day, we all have to die. come. I want one more chance to save Anil. Will you help me? Help my sworn enemy? - Yes. I will. I want to send my junior to Ashok Srivastav's house. I need the permission. - It will be arranged. Agreed that you can make the corpses speak... but when life is standing here and calling you... then why are you interested in the dead? Isn't it, Mr Khan? Let's go for a dance, dinner and then... Ms Asha... - I thought you were joking. Ms Asha, I've taken years to learn about this trick. I still believe that when a man dies suddenly... his spirit is restless because his desires are unfulfilled. You were very close to Ashok and you loved him... would you want his soul to wander? - No. You've got the keys from the police then open the door. Oh! This opened by itself? Please switch on the lights. Come, what happened? Ali, did you feel a whiff of air breeze across? I did. - And you? Many storms have breezed in my life... such whiff of air has no effect on me. I really appreciate your courage. Let's go inside. Ashok Srivastav, due to your sudden death... your soul is not at peace. If you want that your soul should rest in peace... then please appear before us. Put out that cigarette, Ali. You please put out the lights soon. Come back soon. Sit down. We are waiting for your reply. We want to remind you that Anil killed you. Three bullets were shot from his revolver. Two hit the wall and one hit your head. No. - Then? The third hit at the painting at my bedside. At the painting on your bedside that means... What...? - That means Anil did not kill Ashok. That's what the spirit says... but let's check the painting. Where could the bullet have hit on this painting? Ali look here, the bullet hit here. That means nobody saw this earlier? - Nobody could see it. Now, if Ashok did not die with Anil's bullet then how did he? The police has stated that out of six bullets, Anil fired only three. That means Ashok died with the fourth bullet. But who fired the fourth bullet? - Let's ask the spirit. Why do you want to ask Ashok's spirit, I will tell you. The fourth bullet was fired from the same revolver which killed Ashok. And today, the same revolver will take you both close to Ashok. Then you can ask him. Let go! Come out Mr Khan, Mr Mukherjee. Here is the killer. - Have you caught her? Yes. - Thank God we are saved! Agarwal, how did you come here? - Somebody had to play the spirit. And who could have been better than him? Thanks for saving us. I sneaked into this flat and inspected it. I was hiding in Ashok's cupboard and acting as his spirit. This was my plan. - Now this case has taken a new twist. I told you that Anil was not the killer but you did not listen. I'll report to the police. - Yes, go. But keep the pillow here. What do I do with her? - Hold her properly. Yes, I was the one who shot Ashok. And until debauch men like Ashok Srivastav are alive... every young girl has the right to shoot like this. Do you have to say anything about Ms Asha's statement? Your Honour, Ms Asha has made a confession about her crime. The circumstances under which she confessed her crime... in Ashok's flat, I was there to witness it. I have nothing more to say. But I have to say something, your honour. The evidences are strong against Ms Asha... but nobody can think that the bullet extracted from Ashok's body... does not belong to her revolver but to some third revolver... which I accidentally discovered in the drainpipe. Your Honour, this is that revolver. Ballistic reports say that the bullet from this gun killed Ashok. And the fingerprint experts say that this gun has Ashok's fingerprints. Anil's statement says, "I and Ashok had a deadly fight" "2-3 bullets were fired from my revolver but it did not injure anyone" "In the course of this fight, the revolver dropped from my hands" "And in a split moment, Ashok went away from me" "The lightning struck again and I saw that..." "the revolver was in Ashok's hand" It's quite obvious that during this time Ashok had taken out his revolver. Your Honour, this is the revolver with which Ashok died. This revolver has only Ashok's fingerprints. That means, Ashok killed himself. Your Honour, on the night of murder, when Anil went to Ashok's flat... and when a fight broke out between them... at that time, Anil had a revolver in his hand. They fell on the bed. Three bullets were fired from Anil's gun, but no one was injured. Meanwhile, Anil's revolver fell on the floor... Ashok pushed Anil and sped towards the table. He took out his revolver from the drawer which Anil did not notice. And impulsively, Anil went for the gun. And they started fighting again, Asha was watching everything. They were yet fighting and meanwhile, Asha took out her revolver... she thought that she wouldn't get a better chance to seek her revenge. Both were fighting and reached to a window and Asha shot at Ashok. At the same time, Ashok's revolver also fired a bullet... which hit his head and killed him. Scared, Anil ran off! Asha didn't realise that she missed her aim. She was sure that Ashok died of her bullet. To save herself, the revolver that had Ashok's fingerprints... she covered it in a kerchief and hid it in the drainpipe. And let Anil's revolver which had Anil's fingerprints, remain there. That is why, your honour, members of the jury, it is proved that... Ashok Srivastav killed himself. Anil Kumar Sahni is innocent and he should be released. This was a very strange case. Nature has meted out justice at the hands of the criminal. The unanimous decision of the members of the jury is that... that Ashok Srivastav accidentally killed himself. The court seconds this decision and releases Anil Sahni. I am very happy! To see this day I had prayed to God. I told God to keep me alive for this day and then he can take away my life. Who can experience this joy even after laying down his life? I did not sin, Anil but please forgive me. Until then, the fire would have burned my body and made it pure. Don't say that, Nina!
