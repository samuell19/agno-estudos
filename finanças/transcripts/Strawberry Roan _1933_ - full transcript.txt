Howdy, partner. Hello, stranger. It's a lovely camp you got here. Yeah, why don't you join us? I will. Make yourself at home. Do you see what I see? Why, it's the old maverick himself. We just been talking about him. Why, Ken, you old horse fly! How'd you happen to find us? That was easy. I heard you playin'. You're the world's worst, you know? Where you been keeping yourself the last two or three years? I've been settled down in my own place for quite a spell, and I got a hankering to see the gang, though. And well, I'm here, ain't I? Boy, you are welcome. You know a lot of the boys here. The rest of 'em would be mighty proud to meet up with you. - Come on. - Hey, boys! Hey, cowboys, come up here. Meet our old buddy, old boy. You know Billy. Hello there. - Ken. - How are ya? - Bill, how are ya? - Nice to see you, Ken. This looks like quite a gather. This is quite a reunion, isn't it, huh? Yeah, I say, Ken, I just put a brand new bridge in this old fiddle box. Give her some of that old time music like we used to play. Yeah, I don't mind if I do. You fellas were getting along pretty good when I come up though. Sounds mighty good. Best choose it. What do you wanna play, partner? Well, I don't think there's any better rain song than that old "Strawberry Roan" of yours, Curley. Let's play it. Old boys. Sure like old times, boys. For wine and for women, he never was strong, but he's a double barrel wild cat when it comes to song. Haven't changed a bit, Shanty. The only person finds cowboying captivity, huh? How's you fitting? Everything's all right now, let's go. All right, here we go. ♪ I was hanging around just wasting my time ♪ ♪ Out of a job and not holding a dime ♪ ♪ When a fella steps up and he says ♪ ♪ I suppose that you're a bronc fighter ♪ ♪ By the looks of your clothes ♪ ♪ He guesses me right and good one I claim ♪ ♪ Have you got any bad ones that you want me to tame ♪ ♪ But he said he had one and a bad one to buck ♪ ♪ And for throwing good cowboys ♪ ♪ He's had lots of luck ♪ ♪ Claim this old pony had never been rode ♪ ♪ And the boys that gets on him ♪ ♪ They sure do get throwed ♪ ♪ And I gets all excited and I ask what he paid ♪ ♪ To ride that old pony for a couple of days ♪ ♪ He offers a ten spot Says I am your man ♪ ♪ But there never was a bronco that I couldn't stand ♪ ♪ Never was a horse Never true friends ♪ ♪ That I couldn't ride very far from this place ♪ Here, Hank, take it. Always something with the boys. Glad to play. Yeah, come on back. Well, gang, how goes everything? How you been getting along? Oh, all right, Ken. We're still punching dogies. - Yeah, where you working now? - In the north part, Ken. Oh, I thought you was over in that brush creek country. Not yet. What have you got to say for yourself, old buzzard? Not much, Ken. Put in charge and just as poor as I always was. Curley, that reminds me of the old days. That sure is some song. I'll say it is, and that sure was some horse. Yes. Some horse, what do ya mean? Why, that's only a song some hombre wrote. Says you, smart guy. There sure was such a horse. Hey, Ken, tell these fellas about that old Strawberry Roan, will you? Well, yeah, what's the matter? Some of these boys don't believe there ever was such a horse. I guess there was such a horse, wasn't there, boys? - There was. - What a pony! - He'll tell 'em about it. - He sure will. Say, Shanty, let's play "The Strawberry Roan" again for him, just to get him in the spirits. Nice and easy like. There wasn't a whole lot to it. Bunch of us was over in the river rock country one time. We were poor, didn't have a dime in our pockets. That's fine, boys! Come on, I'll buy you a drink. That's just what we're playing for. I'll have mine. Here you go, boys. This is sure gonna hit the spot. This ain't gonna miss. - You... - Ha. I thought you hombres were out looking for a job. I should toil and fret and sweat, while rounding up dumb steer, when for a tune, I can earn the room and have some left for beer. Well, we were out looking for work all morning, Ken. Honest we were. Jobs are awful scarce around these parts. Yeah, you're right, boys. I've been out all morning myself, couldn't find a thing. Whoa, boy, whoa! Quiet. Take the line there, daughter. You wait here a few minutes for me, will ya? - Yes, Daddy. - I won't be long. Bart. Bart! Bart, hurry, you know this rheumatism has got me down. Yes, sir. Easy now. Mighty concerned you don't hurry. Give me my stick. Give it to me. You know I can't move much without it. I gotta ask for everything I get. Bart. Remember, no drinking. Who, me? Not a chance. Come on, come on, Bart. Hurry up, will you? What's the matter with you? All right, boss. Hello, Jim. - Hey! - Hi, Jim. Hello, Jim. I ain't feeling too good today. No, that's not enough for me. You're looking pretty good. Come on, boys, everybody have a drink with me. That's it. Go on then, set 'em up, set 'em up for the house. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Well, Jim, how are things? Oh, things are pretty good, except that old roan is on the rampage again. - No. - Yes. What's that darned lord done now? Killed anybody? Oh, he ain't killed nobody, but he pawed up one of my boys pretty bad. I'm here to hire any of you bronc fighters that's out of the job and looking for work. You can count me and my two partners in on that, Mr. Edwards. I'll say you can't. Boss, it'd be cheaper to let that roan run off a few mares now and then, instead of staging such a round-up. Oh, Bart, I'm determined to see that roan saddle rode. That suits me, Jim. - We'll make a contest of it. - Contest? Yes, and I'll hang up a prize, it'll be well worth riding for. What prize? To the man who can ride that roan till he quits, I'll deed my title to the Double Bar Ranch. - You mean it? - Yes, sir. Well, what do you think of that, hey? That's some prize, ain't it, hey? Hey, sure, Shanty, any one of us can ride that roan. Colonel, that looks like a mighty big prize for just a little horse riding. - What's the catch? - No catch. I've got enough to last me the rest of my life. And I have a notion that the man who finally conquers that roan will be the kind of man to own the Double Bar. Jim, when you get that roan corralled, let me know, and we'll begin the contest. Attention, boys. Any of you boys that want to get in on this better saddle up. I'm leaving for the ranch, pronto! If I get a chance for that old horse for a long time... I'd wrangle it to save us all, boys. Hello, Alice. I didn't know you were in town. How've you been? I intend but... I feel neglected. Why haven't you been over to see me? Well, I've been pretty busy looking for a job. I finally found one though. Oh, really? Something I've been wanting to do for a long, long time. You're not going away? - Afraid I am. - Oh, Ken. I'm coming right over to your house and go to work. Your father just hired me. - No! - Sure, he did. Well, now maybe we'd get rid of this cussing roan. Well, we'd better, boss. We've been wanting this dang thing for a long time. All right, here we go. Here, take my cane, daughter. Yes, Daddy. Boost up a little bit there. You might as well learn your place right now, cowboy. Mana for the rest of the hands. Look here, Bart, I ain't siding in with any of them highfalutin notions of yours. Now, Mr. Edwards, as your foreman, I think I ought to be able to handle these men in my own way! All right, Bart, have it your own way. You got your orders, get going. All right, partner. Here we go, let's get rolling on out of here. Giddyup! Come on, Ken, let's get going. Come on, let's go! Be right with you, boys. Let's go! Boys, there's your wild horses, all right. Strawberry Roan himself. I wonder where that kicker came from. I've never seen him before. What a battle he's putting up. Say, you know, I've been looking that herd over pretty careful-like. I can't seem to see them bloody mares Big Jim has been losing. Can you, Bart? Now's your time, boys. Ride him down. Wait a minute. That's no way to go about catching that animal. That is, providing you really wanna snare him. Just what do you mean by that? Why, we ought to split up, sneak up on him. Less danger of a stampede that way. All right, Masters. You ramrod the outfit. - I'll look on. - All right. Hey, boys! You fellas go out over those rim rocks and down that north canyon, will you? Rest of you boys better slip down that coulee over there and come up on the left-hand side. I'm gonna watch this box canyon. We'll round them up in no time. It's gonna be a cinch. Go ahead, get after it, boys. Miss Alice, we should keep an eye on Bart. Don't let him know you're watching. - You mean that... - I don't know anything yet. I got a suspicion he don't want the roan caught. Now we're gonna take it easy, boys. You fellas better circle up over that hogback. I'll watch this canyon. Go ahead. Whoa. Whoa, boy, easy. Now, listen, bust straight down on the herd and chase that stallion off. If anybody spots you, well, we'll say you were drunk, savvy? Sure. With that roan corralled, it's gonna be kind of hard covering up the loss of any more mares. It's liable to... Shut up. Get going. What's the matter with you? You spoiled my loop. I were trying to help you, that's all. I was trying to forefoot it. - Yeah? - Yeah. I guess you were, all right. Take it down around that post, Alice. That's it, hold him now. All right, I've got him, Ken. Whoa, boy, whoa. Well, you got out of that all right, didn't you? I'll say I did. You're lucky. You're not hurt, are you? No. Just pride. Well, we got him all right, but riding him is bound to be something else. Really tall, ain't he? He sure don't look tough to me! Say, Shanty, you better ride double with Curley and leave your horse here for Miss Alice. All right, Ken. Now, Buck, don't get jealous. I haven't forgotten you. Here. Why, Miss Alice, what are you trying to do? Tame him like you did the deer? I hope to. We were getting along fine until you came along. I can't understand that. He's been perfectly quiet. I guess it's because he's penned up. It would be a shame to break his spirit. You think you can ride him? Well, I don't know, Miss Alice. I'm sure gonna give him a mighty whirl if I get a chance. Ken, please be careful. Of course I will. Hello, honey. We've been looking for you. Yes, we want you to draw the names of the boys that are going to try to ride the roan. Oh, I'd love to, colonel. Come on, come on, now, let's get going. Hey, boys, come on, get started. Say, you, I want you to keep away from Alice, savvy? We're engaged. I don't believe it. You mean to call me a liar? Yeah. You guessed it the first time. Well, I don't wanna cause any trouble now. We'll settle this after the contest. You mean if I turn my back, don't you, Hawkins? I hope I draw it first. Well, Jim, looks as though it's going to be mighty tough for somebody. I reckon as how. Boys, in this hat are strips of paper containing the names of all of you. Alice will draw them one at a time, until someone succeeds in riding the roan. How does that suit you, boys? Hope I get the first set. I sure hope this is my lucky day. Yeah, and I'm feeling just right. Man, but I'm gonna hang onto this rabbit's foot with my left paw. - Shanty! - Shanty! Shanty, where are ya, Shanty? - Shanty? - Where are ya, Shanty? Come here, you long hard. A lot of luck to ya. You're gonna need it, too, when you ride that critter. Old Strawberry Roan is sure in for a ride. I'm gonna tie him in bone hearts and peel off his hide. - Onward! - Good luck, Shanty. Get the handle. Get him out, boys. Come on, put that halter on. Well, hold him there. We'll get him on here. Hold him right there now. - Get him! - Kick him! Don't let him there, Shanty. What a ride he's getting! Boy, what a fall that fella took. Get a hold of him. Man, don't let him buck around. Shanty? Hurt you bad, boy? He's not hurt real bad, is he, boys? Nah, he's just knocked out. Take him up, see what we can do for him there. He's not hurt too bad. Here, pick out the next victim. Water. Hey, he's not hurt very bad, fellas. Let's make another draw. He'll be all right, let's go see who's gonna ride next. Lay here, boy. I don't think there's any broken bones. He's just knocked out. Pretty hard ride. Better take him to the bunkhouse, boys. - Okay. - He's just shaken up a little. He'll be all right. Well, there's one of them out of the way. Can you make it? Come on, Alice, let's have some more fun. This contest is an outrage, and I'm not going to have anything more to do with it. I'll see if I can get her to change her mind, colonel. All right, kid. Well, Jim, I guess it's up to you to pick 'em. Looks like it. Hey, boys! Come on, we're going to pick another number out of here. That's fine, wonder who's gonna be lucky this time. Well, are you all ready? - Sure! - Well, here she goes. Slim. Hey, you get to ride this time, boy. Come on, man. Alice? Honey, I wouldn't worry about the cowboys getting hurt in this contest. They're used to that sort of thing. Nothing is worth risking your life for, Ken. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to disagree with that. One thing I know is... and then some. There he is. Say, I wonder if this little hombre here's really hurting bad. Nah, he's all right. You couldn't kill him with a pickax. Well, if he's playing possum, I'll bring him out of it. Go ahead. What's going on here? Nothing's going on, but a lot's coming off. Lay down, cowboy. Oh, now wait a minute, boys. What's this here? Ow! Get out of here! How's Shanty, boys? Hey! Hey! I guess he's all right. See, you done all that worrying for nothing. You can't kill a cowboy. Cut him loose. Little roan! - Come on, Slim! - Ride him, Slim! Ride him, Slim. Ride it on the neck. See, honey, what did I tell you? He picked out a nice little place, didn't he? Cowboys are smart that way. Come on, boys. Come on, let's see what the next one is. Well, if that's the best riding the boys can do, I reckon I better get married and find my heir in the usual manner. Jim, pick a good one this time. Go ahead, here goes. Curley! - Atta boy, Curley. - Me? I'll say he picked a good one. Wait a minute, boys. Wait a minute. Now in fairness to all concerned, I believe the man whose name is on this paper should get the next ride. That is, providing Curley fails to make the grade. - That's fair. - Is that fair? Bart, if this contest goes over another day, you'll get a crack at the roan the first thing in the morning. Colonel, once I throw a leg over that cayuse, you're gonna get a moving picture of your ranch moving right out on you. Oh, yeah? But remember, I'm riding him now. Attaboy, Curley. Good luck, old fella. Now take a deep seat, cowboy. Now, listen, you fellas, when you turn him loose, I want you to get plumb away from him. I don't wanna any interference. I'm gonna ride this roan till he quits. All right, let him go. That was a fine thing to do. Get him up to the post. Man, don't let him buck around. Give me that rope. Take him up, boys, get him out of the corral. Hey, are you hurt real bad, boy? Hey, get out of there! Get on your own side of the corral, hurry up! Ha! Look! He's got Ken down. Stop him! - Hurry, boys. - Get him, fellas. - Get a rope on him. - Rope, rope. Hurry! He'll paw that man to death. - Get a rope on him, Buck. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Come on. - Are you all right, Ken? - Are you hurt? - No, no. I'm not hurt. Looked as if that roan was gonna paw you to death, Kenny. He'd done his best for a minute, wasn't he? We better get that roan back on his own. There can't be anymore riding today. - How's Curley? - All right, Jim. He's all right, he's coming to. Better go take a look at him. Come on. I'm all right, boss. Come on, let's get him on his feet. I'm all right. How're you feeling, Curley? Not hurt, huh? Oh, nothing's broken, I don't reckon. You're gonna be all right in the morning and just as poor as ever. Better take him to the bunkhouse, boys. All right. We're gonna have things to pull pretty soon. He took a pretty hard bump. Oh, I do wish we could do something to stop this contest. Someone's gonna get killed. Gee, Alice, the boys would never stand for it now. There's too much at stake. You'll feel differently about it in the morning. Sure, you will. It'll be all right. Hey. I want you to ride over to Bat's place and bring the gang back here. I've got a scheme all figured out. Yeah? Suppose you'll let me in on it? Right after dark, I plan to get a rope around that roan's neck and get him out of the corral. After I get him far enough away, I'll choke him down, now savvy? Yeah, I get you, and in the morning, you'll be able to ride him easy like, hey? You said it, now dust. Say, listen, why bring in the gang? Me and you can handle this job alone. You know we gotta get that herd out of the country. With that roan corralled, they'll catch up with us in no time. Oh, all right. The only horse you'll ever ride is on a merry-go-round. Oh, yeah? You didn't look like the old horse lassoer on that roan yourself. Do you want me to get these chaps off for ya? No, no, Benny, just leave 'em on. I'll get 'em off. Get me a drink of water, Donny. Sure. Well, partner. How're you feeling now? Comfortable? Yeah, I'm all right, Ken. Just kind of busy in the head. Busy says ya? Boy, you sure get my manny. Your head solid bone, and your brain's in your... Whatchamacallit. You're gonna be all right in a little bit, anyhow. That was a plumb lousy trick you pulled on me, Bart. I'll be remembering it when I get out of this bed. Say, you insinuating I tried to get you thrown? Well, I was just cheering you on. On his back, you mean. I ain't insinuating nothing. I'm just making a straightforward statement. You pulled a fast, and it's a dirty trick. Say, you. Just a minute, mister. Curley ain't able to help himself, you can do your arguing with me. Oh, yeah? Well, I'll bend a six-shooter over you. - Let up, Ken! - You stay out of this, boys! He's had this coming for a long time. He's gonna get it right now. Come on now. Get him, cowboy! Thanks, partner. You did just as good a job as I was wishing I could do. It's all right, kid. Well, that was a real fight. He really shot the moon that time. - Yeah, he did. - A dollar and a half, you owe me. - And split with you. - Yeah. I'm even with you, boys. Ah, cut out the arguing. I wanna go to sleep. You know we're going after that roan tomorrow, and I might get a chance to ride him. You won't wanna ride him after tomorrow night. Why, you bloodhound. Come on, get 'em up here, fellas. What're you doing, partner? Trying to figure out how many acres I lost by getting bucked off? Nah, Curley. I'm just putting two and two together. That old tune of yours, the nature of that wild horse. I think I got something pretty good here. Get that guitar of yours, let's try. - All right. - Hey, Shanty. - Yeah? - Come on. Get that old pie box of yours, that push box. - Sure, Ken. - Let's try this. What are we gonna play? Here, right here. Let's try that now. All right, you ready? - You have me on. - I am, partner. ♪ I was hanging around just wasting my time ♪ ♪ Out of a job and not holding a dime ♪ ♪ When the fellas came through and he says I suppose ♪ ♪ That you're a bronc fighter by the looks of your clothes ♪ ♪ You guessed that right and I put in my claim ♪ ♪ Have you got any bad ones that you want me to tame ♪ ♪ He said he had one and a bad one to buck ♪ ♪ One's a fighter He'd had lots of luck ♪ ♪ Says this old pony had never been rode ♪ ♪ The cowboy got on him was sure to get throwed ♪ ♪ Well, I got all excited and I asked what he pays ♪ ♪ To ride that old pony for a couple of days ♪ All right, man! That sure is a good song. Chief, I'll take some of the boys and get that herd started. Now you know what I want done to that roan. Leave it to me. I'll fix him so a baby could ride him. All right, boys, bring him on out. Hey, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute, you ain't playing the thing right. What do you mean, I'm not playing it right? You got it in the wrong key yourself. What do you mean, the wrong key? Well, I had enough keys... Hey, listen, why don't you tune it down then if he wants it down? - All right. - If he wants it up, change it. Well, let him tune his, I've got mine all right. How can he change that pie box without jerking all the stops out of it? He can't tune his up, or down-tune. Sure cannot. Well, I ain't gonna tune this picture right here. - Come on. - No, no, that's the wrong one. Right over here, see, right in the C. What are you...? Okay, left, left, left here, Shanty. Right here. Hey, hey, Ken, you ain't running out on us, is ya? I guess you just getting disgusted with your own words to my tune. It's not the words that's bothering me. The way you want to sing 'em. Boy, I always told you. All right, let's start now, let's start it right. Well, if you just give me enough to... Shanty, you can make them madder than... Come on now. That's not starting the number. Now let's start the number. Well, put it in C and come on, come on, and don't argue with me anymore. Less talking and more playing. Start... play on then. Come on. Evening, Alice. Why, Ken. I thought I heard you playing with the boys in the bunkhouse. Well, I was. I had something else on my mind, and I just walked away from 'em. Yes? Well, you see, such a pretty evening and all. I... I thought maybe... maybe you'd go riding with me. Of course I will. You go saddle my horse. Sure, I will. Well, looks like you took an awful lot for granted. Ain't mad, are you? Of course not. It'll only take me one minute to change my clothes. All right. Now, boys. Gonna be a lot smarter horse when I get through with it. Whoa, boy. Miss Alice, you know... Whoa! Somebody's moving a bunch of your father's saddle horses up the draw. I didn't know they was taking out anything tonight, did you? Neither did I. You better wait here a minute. I'll go down and find out what that's all about. Come on, boy. Watch yourself, boys. Turn him loose! That stampede will run us down. Yah! Come on, Alice, we gotta get out of here, quick. I can't, Ken, my ankle's turned. Come on, Alice, can you make it? I think so. You all right now? Better. Tarzan. Good work, old man. Mighty good work. I'll say it was, Tarzan. You better look after that ankle of yours now Alice. Oh, it's all right, don't bother, Ken. Well, how do you know? Let's take the boot off, come on. It's all right, I just turned it. Let me take a look at that. Give me that foot. Get back! Go now, get out of here! Do something! Jump out that window! What's happened, boys? I don't know, somebody must have stampeded them. You go and saddle the horses. We'll saddle on and watch them all. Go on now, go saddle the horses up there. There he is again, men! Let's whip. We'll corner him in that box canyon. If I could just ride that old Strawberry Roan, I'd be sitting pretty. Then we could... Get it on him. Get it on him now fellas. I guess you'll have to ride double, Alice. Come on. I sure hate to do this, Jim. Well, we've got to do it, colonel. Wait a minute, colonel. You're not gonna shoot that horse down in cold blood, are you? It does seem cold-blooded, son, but it looks like the only way out. That horse is a menace to the range. You're wrong, colonel. He never did anything but fight for his freedom, like he did when you had him penned up for that contest. How about that stock he's been stealing? I'm not so sure he ever stole any stock. You mean to say they were taken by a rustler? Sure as shooting. Earlier this evening, I caught your foremen running off with one of your best bands of saddle stock. It was his shooting that started the stampede. Where is Bart? Hey, get your ropes on him, boys! Don't let him get away. He won't get away this time. I didn't know that hombre was down here with you. I figured he'd be making his getaway, or I'd have had him a long time ago. Watch this. Hey, finally got ya. Bart. For a long time, I've known you've been rustling off stuff and laying it on the roan. Tonight's the first time I ever had the goods on you. What have you got to say for yourself? I guess you've said about all there is to say. Take him on into town. Hand him over to the marshal. I don't care against them. Well, I still think we ought to rid the range of that roan right now. You're right, Jim. He don't belong to nobody, and I reckon nobody wants him. Ken, isn't there any way we can save him? I think so, honey. Colonel? Before you pass sentence on that roan, I'd like mighty well to have my chance to ride him. Well, Ken, Jim and I decided to give up the contest. Oh, you did, huh? I'd hate mighty bad to think of a westerner going back on his word. You're right, son. I never looked at it that way. Can we call him in? Are you all willing to let Ken have next try, - now that Bart's gone? - Sure. Let him have the next turn! Sure, let him have at it. Let him have it. Thanks, colonel. Boys, let's put a saddle on that pony. We'll get going right now. Cowboy! Ken, I'm afraid. It's the only way we can save his life, honey. If I ride him, he'll belong to me. Don't worry. I guess I'm going for a ride, all right. Wait until I get a deep seat on him. Get her down tight there, cowboy. All right, ready, boys. Ride him, cowboy! Turn him loose! Stick to him, Ken. Attaboy. Get him! Stay with him, Ken. Stay with him, Ken, attaboy. Stay with him, Ken. Attaboy, Ken, attaboy. That's the way I shoulda rode him. Good ride. Pick him up. - Ken, it was wonderful! - Ken! - I was so thrilled. - That was a wonderful ride, and as far as the contest is concerned, it's over. All right, colonel. Then I wanna take advantage of that old time range law. The rider's possession to a wild horse I've rode. Fair enough, Ken. You've won that right as well as the ranch. Thanks a lot. Now just one more thing I wanna do for the roan. Old boy showed a good hand, didn't he, fellas? Yeah. Come on, honey. I'll take him now, boys. Well, now, Ken... Ah, he's all right. He give me a good ride, but he's a good horse. Huh, come along, let me have him. Well, old pony, you're mine, but I'm gonna give you back to the range. How would you like that, huh? Go ahead!
