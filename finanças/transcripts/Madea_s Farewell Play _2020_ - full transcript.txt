All you need to do is just give him a little piece of candy. Cora: OK. Bam: It will regulate his sugar for him. Omar: Hey, hey, hey, that's not a good idea, Miss Bam. Bam: What? What's not a good idea? Omar: I know you're my elder, but I'm a doctor, and I'm telling you, it's not a good idea to just give him sugar. - I can check it for him. - Mm. Bam: Check? I can check it for him. I don't need you checking, babe. We didn't even have no doctors back in our day, baby. We just died with dignity. We don't need you to check it for us. I could check it. I told you, Jimmy used to have this. Brown, stick your tongue out. I know how to check it for him. I can check it for him. Stick your tongue out. Let me check your sugar for-- See, right--uh-oh. See right there? That ain't even no sugar. - Well, what it is? - What is it? - That's the cancer. - What? Well, how you know? Bam: It's because he got two white lines and two white dots outside each other, and his tongue is real ashy. Brown: Yes. I was looking in the mirror this morning, and I looked, and I said to myself, I said, "Self..." Myself said, "Huh?" I said, "You got the cancer on your tongue." - You did? - Just like that. Brown: I already--Cora, am I gonna be able to talk anymore? Cora: I don't know. I don't know. - I think I might be-- - Well, how about-- Cora: I don't know. How about a piece of this?

Madea: Can you write me a weed prescription so I can smoke a little to get my hip out-- Cora: He is not writing you no weed prescription. - Cora... - Huh? - how much weight you lost? - 50 pounds, Madea. - 50 pounds, girl? - Yes. Yes. Thank you, Lord. Madea: Well, you looking good, baby. - You looking good. - I'm looking good? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Mabel... - Hmm? Bam: let me tell you something. Madea: No. Don't say nothing to me, Bam. I told you to wait for me, and you go jump in one of them Ubber lubbedder-dubbedder things, whatever they call this. Ain't even no real Uber, just people just trying to make some money. Bam: Mabel, I called you yesterday, told you I wasn't gonna ride with you, baby. You remember the last time we made that stop. We almost got killed. Madea: That's because I told you to duck. Who the hell don't know how to duck? If somebody said, "Hey, duck," you do this, right? - Yes. You do. - You get down right there, Madea: but watch this. Concentrate. - Bam... - What? - duck. - Nngh! - What the hell is that? - It's a duck. - That's it? - That's it. Brown: What kind of stop y'all make where you almost got killed? Madea: I had to drop something off at one of my clients'. Cora: So what are you doing now, Madea? - Oh, I'm selling weed again. - What? Madea: Yeah. Now that it's legal in a lot of places, baby, I'm selling it. I'm getting my reciprocicussion. I mean, I went to jail for about 3 months back in the Eighties for selling weed. Now that it's legal, baby, I'm getting-- Weed is a wonderful thing, honey. God did that for people. Yes, he did. Brown: Uh-uh. Uh-uh. You're not about to put "God" and "weed" in the same sentence. Madea: Brown, I'm gonna tell you, that weed is a miracle. They pulling stuff called CBD out of it, and you make creams and ointment. You got some swelling and stuff, you put it on your ankle thing, your joints, everything is wonderful. You know I had all them injuries from when I was at the Field, you know. Omar: Oh, yeah, like me, Madea. I was an athlete. - Really? - Oh, yes, ma'am. - What did you play? - Linebacker. Brown: She was a big-backed linebacker like a bear. Madea: I'm about to play stab a black bastard for all the slights. - Say one more thing to me. - Ha ha ha! Madea: No, baby. I wasn't on the field. I worked at a place called the Field. I was a stripper. They called me Bodacious. I dropped that shoulder like that, and all them quarters came rolling up next to me. - It was wonderful, baby. - Oh, wait. Wait. Madea: Bodacious. TiTi: Madea, did you just say that you used to be a stripper? Madea: Yes, and I didn't make it rain, but I sure knew how to make it drizzle. Speaking of that, Cora, Lord, Dr. Phil said, if you are a bad mother, you need to apologize to your child, so, baby, I was watching this show, so I'm just gonna go and apologize to you. I'm gonna apologize to you right now. I wasn't the best mother to you. I didn't even know I was pregnant. I was sitting at the bar drinking and went into labor. - What? - Baby, I was getting totaled. Madea: I went to the doctor. I said, "Something wrong with my stomach." He said, "Ma'am, you've been drinking? I said, "Yeah." "Well, you're in labor." - I said, "Oh, hell." - What? Madea: I looked down at my belly. I said, "Listen, kid. Life is tough. "If you want to come out of there, "you'll have to come on on your own. I'm hot helping you at all. I'm not pushing for you." I was getting you ready for the world, baby... - Oh. - so I went on back to work. Madea: He said, "Ma'am, you gonna leave the hospital?" I said, "Yes. I'm not helping this child." I went on. I put on this-- I went on back to work, and they called me up. They said, "Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Bodacious to the stage." I went up there. I grabbed that pole, spin around, and there you were on the floor. - On the stage? - It was so beautiful. - It was beautiful? - Yes. Madea: You was just covered in glitter and money. It was just beautiful, dollar bills, all dollar dollar bills, y'all, all over you. - Glitter and money? - Yes. It was wonderful. - That's terrible. - That was good? Perry: Yes. Brown: The baby stripper. Perry: Wait a minute. I'm sorry. Ha ha ha! - Baby stripper. - Ha ha ha! Perry: Just glitter. That's so stupid. - Do you need a drink? - That is so stupid. Just glitter. Madea: Baby got glitter. Ooh, my hormone dropping low. I got to figure out what's going on with it. ♪ Mi mi mi ♪ Brown: Maybe you need to get your prostate checked. Madea: I will as soon as you get your uterus scraped. Cora: Oh! Ha ha ha! Sylvia: Ooh, Madea, you-- you have not changed a bit. Madea: That ain't Sylvia sitting over there, baby. - Yes, it is. - Lord, have mercy. - How you doing, baby? - I'm good, Madea. Madea: It's so good to see you. Yes, indeed. You're sitting there smiling, and they tell me your mama's in the hospital on life support. Baby, let me tell you something. That is just so wrong. People have started a pool on the date and a time - your mama's gonna die. - What? Madea: You can win $400 if you guess the right date and time. - Who would do that? - I mean, people are low down, baby, but--listen--your mama was a strong woman. She wouldn't want to be landing like that with people taking care of her, so y'all go up in there on Tuesday morning at 8:11 in the morning... Bam: Hee! Madea: and y'all unplug her. - Madea-- - Don't let it get to 8:12. Madea: Grab that hose and cut it off real quick and choke-- - Madea! - Choke her out. Choke her out. Sylvia: Madea, that is terrible. I've been trying to tell you, she better now. - Thank the Lord. - What you mean, she's better? - She on life support? - No. Sylvia: She's not on life support anymore. - She still in the hospital? - No. She's at home. - You should come visit her. - Lost my damn money. Bam: Mabel--hee!--you started that pool, didn't you? Madea: Yeah. Didn't like her mama. I didn't like her mama, didn't like her grandmother, either. - Why? - Why? Madea: Oh, her grandmother stole my man. I'll never forget it. It was Montgomery, 1954, December 1. - Oh. - It was a cold day... - Mm. - Mm-hmm. Madea: and I was messing around with this white man, - Cora's daddy... - Cora... Bam: I though you was the da-- Madea: and he left me, him and Rose. He was definitely messing around with this woman named Rose. She was my roommate. Then she just moved out, left me there in the house by myself. - Really? - Oh. Madea: Yeah, and I was so mad, I was going to work crying one day singing Negro spirituals, and I looked over up on the bus, and there she was. - Uh-uh. - Really? Madea: Yeah. There she was. I saw her on the bus. She was sitting there like that, and he over there sitting
