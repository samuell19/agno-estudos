Ohara Get off. Keep going. Everyone off. Rule Number 'I- You are not to do the work of others. Rule Number 2- You are not to ask others to do your work. Rule Number 3- You are not to engage in any unnecessary discussion. Hey, is this your first time? You seem so gentle. But weren't you here before? I've spent time at Toyonaka, Kasamatsu, and Yokohama. Tokyo's juvenile halls sure are nice. No matter what happens, you are to follow the schedule to the second. Well then, if you have other questions, or if anything is unclear... ONE TRUE PATH After this orientation's over, they give us our uniforms and a physical exam. Then it's off to the solitary rooms. Hey! Be quiet! Quiet! Next, Ishii Kazue. Houjou Mayumi. Watanabe Mihoko. You get two pairs of panties. It's your responsibility to hold onto them. You Won't get any replacements. Don't lend them to anyone and don't borrow the others'. Put your clothes in here. Hurry up. Ezawa Machiko. Matsunaga Harumi. Midori Karino. What's the problem? I think you forgot to clean these. What? The last girl's ketchup is still on there. Okay. Okay. Sorry for being so selfish. All right. Next. Yes. Yes. Ow. It hurts. If you move around so much, we won't be able to do the examination. What are we going to do about her. It hurts. All right. Next. I don't feel very good today. What's Wrong? You know what I mean. Stop messing around. You're just trying to get out of the exam. Isn't that right? Really. I'm having my period. That's the truth. Okay, how about tomorrow? My flow is so heavy. I don't want to bother the doctor with that. That's what I'm thinking. You can take your exam in the solitary room. - Okay. This way. Here. Matsunaga Harumi. Here. Houjou Mayumi. Here. YEAR 1- I'M FADING AWAY, BUT I'LL QUIETLY LISTEN TO EVERYONE YEAR 2- I MADE MY PARENTS CRY, BUT NOW I SHOW MY TEARS IN THE SOLITARY ROOM Get out of here. Doctor. When was the last time you slept with Chieko? What does it matter? When you were sleeping with Chieko, I'll bet she felt wretched that last time she was with you. What are you saying? Chieko's death was just fate. The teacher is your friend. Your secrets, your fears, I want you to share them with me. You can't obsess over the past forever. You weren't bad kids in the beginning. You're just suffering from heartbreak. This is just a temporary phase in your life. So everyone here is your temporary friend. You can't make any lifelong friends here. You can't trust anyone except your doctor. Teacher, do you have a lover? What? Oh, nothing. In the third year, the crescent moon is in the clouds. And I'm in this jail cell. In the fourth year, in the middle of the night, I remember coffee and cigarettes. Ah, that's right. I forgot. They're all Wet. Whew. Damn. Shit. No reason to go. Can you hear me? That's the bus bringing some kids from here to the courthouse. Then they'll decide who goes to court and who gets to go buy vegetables tonight. The teachers pay close attention and record everything we do here. If you're disobedient, they'll send you to the general prison. You'd better be careful or you'll never get out. Hey, keep walking. Thank you. Three from cell block 1 and three from block 5. Okay, here. Go in. WEST WING Thank you. Ah, some new girls. Hey, I was with that girl in Yokohama. - Which one? - The thin, cute one. Go in. Line up. Those sharing a cell from now on- Houjou Mayumi, Matsunaga Harumi, and Ishii Kazue. Everyone behave yourselves. Okay. Don't stand around like idiots. Sure is cold in here. Wait. Sit over there. You girls stay over there. Don't dawdle. There's no reason to be snobby. In here, things are different than they are out there. All new girls have to tell their story. All of you, from start to finish. Everyone makes a speech. You first. Hurry up and do it. - What are you doing? - Hurry up and do it! Are you huffing paint thinner? What are you doing? Is she crazy? Cut it out. Something must be broken up here. Hey, you're on toilet duty today. Got it? Yeah. You. This is my fourth time in juvenile hall. What did you do? I was a prostitute. A prostitute? Wow! Really? You were an underage prostitute? It's nothing special, but I brought a gift. Keep it. A cigarette. How did she get that in here? Someone get it ready. Yes, ma'am. The baby powder. Hurry. Don't mess it up. - Is it okay? - Don't worry. Yoko, do the honors. Okay. Roll it tight. This will hide the smoke. Don't let any smoke out. Hurry. Pass it around. We still haven't heard your story. Are you too good for us? What's your problem? Why are you acting like that? Answer me! Can you quiet down a little? Introduce her to juvenile hall. Yes, mafam. Stop it. How do you like this? Give her the plucked chicken treatment. Okay. Get her shirt. Like this. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Next is six. Can you take any more? Keep going. If you want to hear my story that badly, I'll tell you. Murder. I've killed someone. You think that makes you special? I'm a killer, too. You bitch. Shit, the guards. The guards. It's the guards. Our fight will have to wait. You're a really big talker, aren't you? Quick. Act normal. Did they notice the cigarettes? Next. Dirty underwear. Wash it well. This is a guy. Pow. - He came. - So cute. This cost 5000 yen. Really? That was 5000 yen? That's right. Men will pay any amount of money for this stuff. How many guys did you do in a day? Well, payday was the busiest day. You must've gotten tired from that. No, stupid! It's fun. I got caught plenty of times, but I couldn't stop. Get in the bathtub. TRUE LIFE So, sister, I heard a man treated you badly? It's true, isn't it? Idiot. How about I make you come? Damn it. WEST WING Sister, can't you sleep? Are you thinking of that man? Men. You shouldn't think about men. They're cold-hearted animals. I heard that if that girl recovers, she'll marry you. That's just a rumor. We've been stuck in a bad relationship. I need to break it off at some point. But didn't you say she chose you as her doctor? - She trusted you. - Idiot. It's terrible to speak ill of a patient before her surgery. Surgery for kidney stones. It's a pretty difficult operation. If the operation fails, that would by no means be out of the ordinary. Is it good? Yeah. What are you doing? Making a rice penis. This is a present from me. Take it. What? Panties? But they're yours. I have dozens of them for some reason. Don't worry. Take them. Thanks for thinking of me. Here! Over here! One more point! Spike it! Spike it! This way! What're you doing? Hiromi's. Rie. What is it? Come here. Yoko, tell Hiromi. Whose panties are you wearing? These? She gave these to me. She's mine. You can't wear those. These? Here. Have them back. My, you're in a bad mood. Clean them and give them back! Who knows how many germs are in between your prostitute legs. Are you an idiot? Didn't you pop out some brats who never knew their fathers? You stuffed them in a locker, and that's how you ended up here. - You traitor. - Sex freak. You bitch. Hiromi, this kid- I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you! I'll kill all of you! Hey! Both of you, stop it! Let me go! Let me go! Throw her in the disciplinary ward! I'll kill you! It's cold. I'm freezing. All right, everyone. If anyone asks about the fight, Rie just went crazy for no reason. Anyone who tattles gets lynched. - Got it? - Yeah. Hold it. Give me your word, too. I can't promise anything. What's with her? She's got a smart mouth. I'll make her look like a panda. She'll be pitch black around the eyes. I was deep in thought. I don't want you crawling around like a cockroach. I understand. Wait up! - It hurts! - Are you okay? Yeah, I saw it, but it's still our secret. I want to get out of here. Go out into the world and be with that person forever. Sister, were you in love with that man? - You. - Hiromi. - More. - Hiromi. Ah, it's my lucky day. Very lucky. You're making a nice profit. Has my man come by? Next time we'll try the Moroya teacup game. Want to go for it? Here you are. Double. Nice. Hey, has my man come by? What's with you? The newlyweds already worrying about him fooling around? - You should calm down. - That's right. - Want some cheese? - Please. Akemi. How's that? Do you like that? Do it quick. Hiromi! What are you doing? Hiromi! Don't do anything stupid! What are you doing? She was a bad, depraved woman. And she ruined my man. That's Why I did it. Has your husband seen you in prison? Just once. I love him, so once was enough. But I want to hear what he thinks of me. I committed murder. If I left here, I'd still go to court. I don't know when I'd see him again. This is my fourth time in here. It's starting to get rough. Are you listening to me? You can keep your mouth shut, right? Let's escape together. What? We're getting too old for juvenile hall. If we go to prison, that's it. I'm with you. Tomorrow, during gymnastics. There's a girl who used to be in here. A thief. She'll get the master key and throw it in to us. If she can pull that off, then I trust you from there. You were listening to us, huh? I don't talk to anyone. You don't need to worry. Oka Harumi. Next. Your name? Suzuki Eriko. Next. Your name? Obara Tokiko. Okay. Next. - Your name? - Kurosawa Miki. Don't hide anything. - Your name? - Ikezawa Mari. Don't hide anything. Next. Your name? Kobayashi Keiko. - Your name? - Andou Tome. Next. Your name? - Katou Michiko. - Okay. - Next. - Lend me that. - Name? - Matsuda Kimi. Next. Your name? Your name? Hey! You! - Your name? - Matsunaga Harumi. Okay. Next. - Your name? - Ishii Kazue. Okay. Next. Next. - Your name? - Houjou Mayumi. Hold it. Take that thing out. Go ahead. Next. Your name? - Shibata Haruko. - Okay. Next. - Your name? - Nozawa Ryou. Okay. Thanks. I owe you one. But don't spread this around to anyone. If you do that for me, you can be my associate. I did it on a whim. Don't misunderstand my intentions. Ken. Harumi, are you well? You've gotten thinner. That's fine, but without you by my side... I can't lead a full life. I remember riding a boat with you at the Omoto Hot Springs. And that steak we ate at Fukuhara was good, wasn't it? Get out of here soon, and I can find you work again. You know how it works. In juvenile hall, even if you're mature, if the teachers don't like you, you'll never get out. You'll have some difficulties, but listen to me. Don't defy them. Don't try to rush anything and don't give up. Okay. I'll be waiting for that great day when you get out. Keep your head up and be careful. That's great. So charming. Harumi's been rattled ever since that guy came to see her. That guy's no good. Damn it. Here's the chart. - Can you go get the charts from the 28th? - Yes. This one shows it, too. Everything points to death from malpractice. Listen. They're still confirming everything. I just used the drugs that you prepared to perform the operation. Wake up! Take them off. - Where is it? - What are you doing? Where are you touching me? You did it. What did I do? Everyone wake up for punishment! - Wake up! - Let me go! Wake up! Wake up! Everyone wake up! Let me go! Look! What are you doing? Wake up! This is abuse! Don't resist! Everyone take your clothes off! Line up facing the Wall! Stand up! Get up! Nothing here. Spread your legs. I told you to let me go, you pig! Back off! God damn it! You fucking pervert! Be quiet! - Ow! Let me go! - Be quiet! I'll kill you! All of you, let me go! Let me go! What happened? What did they say? No explanation. Just a surprise examination. Assholes. Do they think this is some kind of joke? I'll out that pervert guards head off. I'm not kidding. She's got a cold, too. Violating her ass before she's married. Those bastards. What the hell were they looking for? We aren't here for your old dick, asshole. Where's our food? I'm hungry. Are you harvesting the rice or something? Hurry up! Bring us our food now! Are you going to confess? We've got the evidence. Where's the key? Are you going to talk? Talk! Say it! Quiet! Knock it off! Stop it! We'll throw you all in the disciplinary ward. Who's the ringleader here? We Won't go so easy on you if you cause another disturbance. Keep up this insubordination and you'll never get out of here. Rie, what's Wrong? What is it? It's because they made her do the can-can stark naked in the middle of the night. And it was so cold. They're crazy. Rie. Is it morning sickness? Really, Rie? Is it true? Rie. Do you know who the father is? Don't tell the teachers. They'll get rid of it. That's unnecessary meddling. It doesn't matter who the father is. I'm the mother. That's certain. I'll give birth to it. And when you do, are you going to stuff it in a locker again? - No way. - She couldn't do that. She can't get rid of it. Stand up. What are you doing? Stop! Mayumi, stop! Someone stop her! Hurry up or she'll kill the baby! It hurts. It hurts. Ms. Houjou, what did you do? I showed that girl the Way to a comfortable life. Leave this up to me. Thank you. I've tried so hard to understand you. But for a girl like you to do something like this... I can't just keep you on probation. This has nothing to do with you. What did you say? You- How can you not understand? Someone! Someone help! Someone! What happened? To the disciplinary ward. Come on. Hey. Hey- Hey- Nice. Look. Look at this. Please, take the handcuffs off. No. It's against the rules. But... Let's get out of here. Fire! Hurry. Quickly! Hurry! Go! Fire! Let's go! Hurry up! Let's go! Move! Hiromi. Hurry. Hey, which do you think is better? My man likes loud clothing. Dear, it's me. It's Hiromi. Dear. Who's there? Hiromi? How did you- What are you doing here? Don't be stupid! What do you think you're doing? Dear. I missed you. Dear. Mayumi. What are you doing here? Mayumi. Don't be stupid. You don't understand. WOMEN'S JUVENILE HALL Harumi, I brought you your favorite, takoyaki. You're a clever girl. Did you tell the teachers about your friends' escape plans? Now you're a repeat offender. If you hadn't done it, you'd have been sent to court for sure. You must've made a good impression on the teachers. That's right. By the way, Harumi, next time a cop arrests you, make sure you've got a good occupation, okay? That's right. Ah, I need to get rid of the filth from the juvenile hall. Can you hold on a minute? Make it quick. Year 10, finally, my term is up. So goodbye, everyone. Take good care of your tools of the trade. Of course. Ah, Ken, can you toss me some toilet paper? Of course. What is refined about the flower that went astray? What is sincere about the flower that's honest? If you bloom somehow, crimson lotus flower, may you bloom in the waters of heH. THE END
