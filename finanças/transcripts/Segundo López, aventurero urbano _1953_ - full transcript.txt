Segundo López Urban Adventurer Based on the novel of the same title by Leocadio Mejías. Ana Mariscal expresses her gratitude to the friendly people of Madrid for their collaboration during the shooting of this film. In this peaceful city, Segundo López was born. He spent the first 47 years of his life here, playing tute, julepe and toad in the hole, contemplating the Extremadura landscape and getting drunk from time to time just to kill boredom. This good, illiterate, sentimental man never worked on anything, because he spent his whole life under his mother's protection, From who he has just inherited a modest produce store. Segundo López sold this business, thereby getting rid of the only thing that still linked him to his people. And one day, without even thinking about it, he took the first trip of his life. Hey, hey! Don't you know that the line is here. The line is here! -He's drunk. -Drunk? Drunk my ass! -One ticket for Madrid. -Third class? Is fourth class not available? 76.80 pesetas -Hey! Wait till I give you the change -Leave it. Have a few drinks on me. Come on, dude! Be more careful about where you're going. You just don't care, right? That's great! ♪ The sky has darkened, ♪ ♪ the sea is raging, ♪ ♪ It threatens the small boats ♪ ♪ and the lightning flashes, ♪ ♪ the thunder rumbles. ♪ ♪ Woe to the sailor's boats . ♪ ♪ Calm comes after the storm. ♪ Any luggage, sir? I... I'm travelling only with what I carry on me. What I've gotten myself into. Boy announcing the news. Hey! Give me one of those. Thank you, thank you very much. A portrait? And why do I want that if I don't have anyone to send it to? Listen, my fellow countryman. -Hey, you! -Me? -Where are you from? -Come on, I'm sure you have some chick sighing for you. -Are you from Cáceres? -Just pose and you'll see how good the photo looks. Leave me alone. Do you know anything about maps? Well, in this life you have to understand a little bit of everything. What street do you want to find? Actually... I don't know. Do you know a place where you can have a drink? You should have said so sooner. I know a place where for 2 pesetas they serve you a full glass of milk. -Well, let's go there. -Let's go. Waiter! What's it gonna be? I want a glass of milk with a twist: double and with a braided bread. What do you think? You could order it with buns for all I care. Don't you ham or pork loin sandwiches? Or anything like that? No but there are pastries and we also serve coffee. Then bring me some pastries, coffee and a drink. Just think about it. They have here a whole party of crazy folks but there's always room for one more. That one, for example, is a wise man who is devoted to mathematics. And that other one so skinny? He is a very clever writer. What happens is that he doesn't eat. If that guy ate, then some useless woman would be next to him. -I'm not bad at writing verses. -I could tell already by how you look. Well, I'll better be going. You'll probably have some things on your own as well. What's the hurry? Actually I have to attend a baptism and I'd like to get it done quickly. And in life you should do everything quickly too. -Goodbye. See you around. Get well soon. -Goodbye. How healthy and in shape she looks! Listen. What's the name of that girl who's scrubbing? -Francisca Minglanilla. It's a good girl. -I can see that. In that place, at any time of the day, the clock always showed 3:05 pm. Segundo López, in the middle of the big city, was at a fixed point just like the clock. Obsessed with that girl he saw on his arrival 8 days before. (humming a song) What a dreadful life. God, I wish I were a lady. -Bring me pen and paper. -Alright. Here you go. This pen doesn't write. Damn, what a stomp! You've left me in a bad way. Didn't I tell you that you can't pick up cigarette butts here? Let him be. Everyone makes a living the best they can. -Do you want a coffee? -If you pay for it. -Have a sit. Get this boy a latte. Is your name Don Segundo López? -And how do you know that? -Because I'm reading it on this paper. -Do you know how to write? -Yes, sir. Here. Let me see. What does it say there? Chirri. That's my name. When I was little they began to call me Chirri and now everyone calls me that. -Do you have a mother? -No, sir. And no father either. We're on the same boat. You'll be more comfortable here. My mother died of typhus when I was 5 years old, and left me with a blind man . With a blind man? Yes... I was with him until I stood him up. I was fed up of being with him. -Did he beat you? -No, no sir. It's just that I prefer to be on my own. I feel better this way. Take Chirri, have a cigarette and drink this coffee. And where do you live? I eat wherever I find and sleep wherever I can Chirri... Do you know of any inn around here? Yes, but they charge 7 pesetas and you have to pay in advance. Well, money is not important. I have 15,000 pesetas. Wow! If you need a cheap bellhop for your business, you know. Yes, I do. I need a person skilled and he has to be someone I can trust. Let's shake hands, Don Segundo. You're swell! You're going to write some verses for me. Oh Francisca Minglanilla. You have me head over heels in love. Stop. Is for you I come to the dairy, and I'm crazy about you because you are a wonder. Geez! You're not very talented. Now go ahead and write the envelope. You're going to put there... Mrs. Francisca Minglanilla. For your consideration. Now I'll put my signature. It's shocking how long women can keep you waiting. I warn you Chirri that it is the first time I fall in love. I can tell from the quality of the verses. That's her, Chirri. Go! -Let's see how you do. -Hey, you! -This is for you. -For me? -Aren't you Francisca Minglanilla? Well, that's it. -Who sent you? Don Segundo López, my boss. -I don't know that gentleman. -Just read it! You read it. I don't see very well in the dark. Oh Francisca Minglanilla, you have me head over heels in love. It's for you I go to the dairy. And why is he sending me these verses? Go on, tell your boss go make fun of his father. My boss is very much in love with you. But I don't know him, kid. You don't know Don Segundo López? He's a millionaire. And he has feelings for you just like he said in that poetry. Oh Francisca Minglanilla, it's for you I go to the dairy. and I'm crazy about you because you are a wonder. I am Don Segundo. -Oh you are served in the mornings. -And I can be served at night too. Did the boy tell you what I have to tell you? What a joke! There is no joke here. It's the heart of Segundo López speaking. I have brought you a present so you remember me. And why do you go around with these things? Well, thank you very much. What a pair of stockings! -It's a house where they have some rooms for rent. -It's just what we're looking for. The people are very nice. I can speak to the landlady if you like. Yes, I would like to live here. -See you tomorrow then. -I'll be at the café as usual. This is the Guadarrama haze. Aren't you cold, boss? I'm very strong. Feel it. You're strong as a mule. Come on! Let's go. You eat 40 churros and you feel as good as new. Come on! Drink it. Eat Chirri, eat. Money... Look... The things actually worth in life are honor, love and work. Drink man, drink -Do you want me to keep it? -No. Be careful with the money, you're going to lose it. You're so naive. The money is safe here. Oh Francisca Minglanilla These days happiness lies in honor, love and work. Another drink. Where is my companion? You two left together. Where did I put the money? Maybe the boy took it. What?! -Could that be? -I'm sure. You will never see that boy again. He robbed me... Hey you, aren't you going to pay for the drink? Chirri... Chirri... -A boy this tall, slim. -No, I haven't seen him. -I'm coming! -Watchman... Watchman! Chirri! Take this money and follow that car! Leave me. I haven't done anything. -Where are you going, you dummy? -Leave me alone, please. I'll kill you! You've kept me up all night. Looking for you like a madman. But why didn't you tell me that you needed money? I had given it to you. But Chirri... Am I not your friend? -What a real disappoinment this is. -But I... Here, boss. Keep it. I give it to you so that you're not a thief. To do that to me... I'm feeling an urge to tear you apart. Yes, sir. Forgive me for all the trouble. What do you know about things. Money... I don't want it, boss. Boss! Please don't leave me, boss. I didn't mean it. Well Chirri.. Let's forget the whole thing. 37.50 are missing. I bought a chick a little something. Here it is. What do you want? -We come recommended by Francisca. -Oh yes. Come in, come in. Please, come on in. Are you father and son? No way! He's my boss, I'm his secretary I was asking just in case you want to sleep together. Yes, of course. We both fit in this bed. We take it. That transom window communicates with Francisca's room. In case you want to talk at night. Hey Chirri, we made a good deal. -A good deal. -Awesome. -Whose hat is this? -Someone who forgot it here. -How do I look, Chirri? -You look great, boss. How much for it? 200 pesetas including the room. It's cheap, isn't it? Here. Take it. One thing. Get rid of this phone. -Doña Jacinta! -I'm coming... She's another guest. The poor thing has been in bed for 4 months now. I'll give you the change in a bit. But first come and meet her. Marta, I'd like to introduce you to the... ...gentlemen that have rented the small room. Oh yes, show them in. -How are you? -I'm getting by. And what is it that you're doing? Flowers. Fabric flowers. She's making a living thanks to that. -And who do you sell them to? -I work for the workshops. This really is a work of art. Do you like it? You can have it. Thank you. What this young woman needs is lots of food and exercise. Exercise? I was prescribed bed rest. I know about this stuff. I will take care of this girl and I'll cure her. May God hear you. We'll come by and visit you, if you don't mind. Mind? On the contrary, I'll be very happy about it. Let's go Chirri. Let's have fun, because today is Sunday. Goodbye. I'll be right back, I'm going to give the change to these gentlemen. I have always liked to sponsor artists. (Boys singing and dancing flamenco.) Well, I see you're a respectable woman. Tomorrow I'll get the papers in order. And don't forget about the sewing machine. This is a very practical and cheap model. It's worth 1850 pesetas. Geez, boss! There's nothing else to do. -Where do we send it? -We'll take it with us. Alright, let's proceed to checkout. This way. If I had been told that I was going to fall in love like this, I would have never believed it. Come on, boss. Hello. How elegant you look, Chirri. Let's see, turn around. You look great. You smell of wine. It's just that we went to a tavern to bring you some food. -I really appreciate this. -Now eat.. One for each of us. I can't eat that much. You have to. Come on, give me that. What a piece of ham! You have to eat and get some fresh air. Have some. As soon as you go out for a walk... You'll see. You'll see you'll get better. That's not possible. The doctor himself prescribed me rest. I am the doctor now. Eat that chicken now and gulp down the ham in the evening. But don't you understand, Don Segundo? Please, drop the formalities. Do you know that the boss wants to get married? -With whom? -Francisca. -I think you should wait. -That isn't the right thing to do. What else am I going to do at my age? Just keep fooling around? My boss is in love. To the bone. Let's have a drink to celebrate. Have you ever had a boyfriend? Yes, I had one when I got sick. But since I wasn't getting any better... He stopped coming here. That guy wasn't nice to you. Men like to see happy faces. And I was happy back then. I was healthy. I was working in a magazine. But little by little I lost everything. Why would he want a sick girlfriend? Marta... Don't you worry, it's no big deal. Call Doña Jacinta. -Should I get some aspirin? -Just call the landlady, Chirri. Marta! What's going on? Give me a hand, Don Segundo. Dear Lord, it's the same thing again. Come on! Now you must rest. Rest gives the body a lot of rest. No, I'm alright now. Give me the flowers to resume work. Something like this is what Marta needs. To breath some oxygen and nitrogen. What a good girl she is. Don't you think so, Chirri? Boss, look! It's Francisca. You stand there, Chirri. If you see them come out, let me know. Hey! -Get out of my way! -Come on! They went through that hole, boss. If it is what I am suspecting, I'll crush them. What floor did a woman and a man go to? What do I know, kid? Wait, wait! Chirri, you take that staircase and I'll take this one. If you see them, give me a shout. I feel that I'm being played. Go and take a look on the right side, I'll do the same on the left side. Yes sir, just like in the movies. Escobar Hair salon for ladies. Did a guy and a chick come in here? -I beg your pardon? -I'm asking if a couple of crooks came in here. -This is a respectable hair salon. -If that's the case, please excuse me. Come on in, boy. We were expecting you. The gentlemen's room is on the opposite side. -If I ever get ahold of her... -What? My business isn't with you. -You didn't let me say anything. -Just forget it, boy. The Sunset. Insurance company. Perhaps they're at The Sunset, boss? -What is that? -Who knows, some cabaret I think. They're really high quality. I give it to the fat guy that he has good taste. Well, with money anyone has good taste. 15,000 pesetas, Pepe. That's a fortune. How long does that pedicurist take? If he's like that with all the clientele you waste the w afternoon.. You took your shoes off too soon... Look! There he is. Good afternoon... It seems like it's going to rain! Please tell me. What causes corns? It's a defense mechanism of the body, ma'am. A defense?! You sure meant an offense. Let's have a look, shall we? Your metatarsus is in really bad shape, ma'am. Metatarsus? This one right here is metallurgical and he's also my fiancé. He meant that you're worn out. Pay attention to the pedicurist. The plantar arch is perfect, but the metatarsus... Again with the metatarsus? What I need is for you to remove this corn. It's killing me. I want to be as good as new. Alright, I'll do it. And your foot will look like that of a newborn. Ouch! Be careful with that! Instead of pulling out the callus I should pull out her tongue. Please, be gentle, you're hurting her. But ma'am, for God's sake, I haven't even gotten to the bone yet. I don't know what are you rambling about. I'm coming. -Come on, Chirri. Hurry up. -I'm getting tired, boss. Damn it! It seems that we went too far, boss. The exit must be somewhere else. Doesn't this building have a back door? There only one entrance and that's through the hallway. After all this my legs ache... Why they have to build houses so big. Sooner or later these two have to come out. Shall we wait? We have to be careful. Hurry up! At 7 o'clock I'm meeting that dunce and he's going to give me a sewing machine. -A dunce you say? A dunce? -But what is this? I don't know you at all. -In that case let me introduce myself. -Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! I'm going to kill this dude. What an idiot. This is outrageous! Come on, man Let them fight. I'll kill him. -Just leave me alone. -What are you babbling about, moron. But what happened? That rascal hopes to marry me and that's why he's been brawling. You got off easily. I should have slapped you... Alright! Let's go to the police station. What happened? This guy here was upsetting my girlfriend. You have to take into consideration that I'm a lady. Even if I'm not wearing a fancy coat, I am a lady. And this guy comes trying to abuse me. That's not true! Let my secretary speak. He'll tell you everything. Straight to the point. My boss knocked this asshole down because he had to. -There is no need for insults! -Silence! Tell him about the sewing machine. So he learn about that too. With all due respect, those are just gossips. Nothing but gossips. This is just a drunk guy. I kill her! I kill her! I'm not going to be made fun by... ...some scheming woman. Who is, on top of that, dishonest! -Silence! -Let go of me! I'm going to cut her to pieces like she were cattle. Lock this guy up until tomorrow. The rest of you may leave. Don't worry, Chirri. We'll get our revenge. This is a miscarriage of justice. I demand to speak to your superior! Get out! -Where are you going with that blanket? -It's for my boss. Has something happened to Don Segundo? No way! It's just that we're out on a binge and we're going to sleep outside. Two. -How cold it is. -It's freezing. -It's from your secretary. -Thank you, sir. Here. Give the child 50 pesetas. Churros for sale. -Chirri! -Boss! Give me a hug. What were you thinking waiting for me here? What else could I do? Give me the blanket. What a mess the whole deal with Francisca, right boss? When you grow up you'll understand human injustices. In the future you have to be more careful. You could tell from a mile away that Francisca was a shady person. -Let's go, Chirri. -Whenever you want, boss. Has that filthy woman returned yet? -She is sound asleep. -Asleep? Now you'll see. Take this, you slut! Ouch! Help! They're killing me! You are despicable! And that's the end of my first love. -Won't she keep the boot, boss? -What difference does it make? She can have both boots and even the sewing machine. It's a gift from Segundo López. And now what? What do I know? For now, let's rest. -Do you think we'll have good weather tomorrow? -Yes, we might. -Why? -That we could go for a walk with Marta. Yes, of course. Come on. Get up, we're leaving. -But if I don't... -No buts! I'll give you the scarf lest you catch cold. -And you go and get a cab. -Ok, boss. I bet you're feeling much better. -I'm very weak... -Where do you want to go now? I think we should head back home now. -I would like to have a drink there. -Consider it done. Stop! Wine cellar / Charcuterie How about some snacks, boss? I mean, as appetizers. Is that ok with you, Marta? Yes, whatever you want. Hey. Isn't that one your old girlfriend? She doesn't look too well. Is something wrong, Marta? No... What could be wrong? See you later then. -Goodbye -Bye. Carlos... Carlos! Don't you want to talk to me anymore? Oh I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you. How fast do you forget a face. You've also forgotten where I live, haven't you? You have to understand that things can't go on forever. Unfortunately. But Marta, I've never deceived you, I've always been straight with you. -However, I got my hopes up. -You'll get over it. Yes... Goodbye Marta. Goodbye. See? It would be better if I don't leave the house again. The problem with you is that you are still in love. No... What a coincidence to find him there. We went there because I was sure I would find him. She's asleep. Come on boy, take your boots off so she won't hear us. Why are you putting out the cigars there? If I go in smoking she may start coughing. I'll take care of that. Careful, boss. Chirri! You're such a buzzkill. Is it my fault that your jacket is so slippery? How good you are. So good. Isn't this nice? Isn't it beautiful? Yes, of course, but turn the music down a bit. And if you ever get tired of the music, I brought these novels. Which I bet they are all very good. The very best. They cost a fortune. The Complete Works of Goethe. History of Numantia. Michelin Guide Spain - Portugual And wait a second. -What a beautiful shawl, right? -This is nonsense. You two go and return it right now. -Don't you like it? -Yes, very much. But this is not for me, Segundo. This is to go dancing and I... -But isn't it beautiful? -Of course it is. Then there's nothing else to say. But at this rate you're going to end up broke in a couple of days. January 16. February 12 -May I? -Come in. Since you don't go out, I come here to tell you again about the payment. And you already told me that 20 times. But you play dumb and I don't want keep repeating it. -Geez! This old bag is really annoying. -You shut up, punk. Kids should stay out of the conversations of grownups. I'm very sorry, but if I don't get paid today I'll have to take measures. Well, you take them, ma'am. I don't care... I'll go back to the streets and that's it. That's just what I need. Well, I don't care. So you're already leaving. Segundo López doesn't need you at all. Well boss... I didn't mean to say that. You know I'm with you through thick and thin. They could make a movie about us, but Marta is getting worse and needs... That I take care of her. Not bad, right boss? -Don't your kidneys hurt? -No, I'm already used to it. What a heavy job. -40 -20 in drinks. There he is, boss. -Manuel, do you want to buy some goods? -Let's see. -You didn't bring much. -Darn it! Not much? Well, I'll give you 4 pesetas. -Won't you have a 5 to spare? -No, 4. All right. One... two... three... and four. -See you later. -Bye. Shall we continue the hand, buddy? See, boss? Problem solved. And by night we'll be done. Cut the nonsense! We'll eat some tomatoes I saw in Doña Jacinta's house. That's great, Chirri! Here it is, boss. But it's closed. I'll open it. The tomatoes are gone. What a pity. But there's plenty of oil and garlic. Rub the garlic well, you don't get a feast like this every day. Take it. -They say oil has a lot of sulfonamide. -Sulfo what? I don't know... Something that's good for you according to the doctors. We need that. She's going to be fuming when she discover it. -Well, she played us. -What shall we do? Kick the door down. We can't wake up Marta. Let's go. And I feel so sleepy... I know... Don't worry, Chirri, it's just one night, it's no big deal. Turn off the light, Chirri. I must have the back of the chair nailed to the ribs. Chirri... Chirri. I let you in the house because I don't have the heart... ...to leave you in the streets with this freezing weather. Come on! Get out of here, I have to make breakfast. But who drank all the oil from the bottle? If you don't know... Chirri... Did you want us to starve? -Thieves! -Old hag! Chirri! Segundo. What's going on? Nothing. We were hungry so we drank the oil. And all that fuss was for that? Rascals! What you have to do is pay me what you owe me. Aren't you overreacting? I told them to leave. Yes, ma'am, but wh- Right away. And just for the record, Segundo López has the guts to be rich. Wait. Don't go. They leave at once. Don't you worry, Marta. Sooner than you think, we'll be back through that door with a wristwatch, a top hat and a ham under each arm. -Let's go, Chirri. -Bye, Marta. And we'll not set foot in this house again until we're rich. Yes, boss. Who are you thinking about, boss? Well... you see... no one. No one? As if I didn't know. And how do you know? In Marta. I know you like her, boss. -Shut up. -I'd even say you love her. Love? Love? Maybe you're right. In other words, you want her to be your girlfriend. What's strange about that? Aren't you a man? -And isn't Marta a woman? -Yes, of course... You should let her know. Write her some verses. It would be nice if I ended up marrying her, God willing. -Come on, boss. Do it! -I don't know if I'm up to it. I feel dazed today. Oh Marta, my dear Marta, you have me head over heels in love. Wait a second... That's very trite. I know some verses that could be of use. Let's hear them. Oh, my angel of love, do you see that on this secluded shore the moon shines clear and pure and one breathes more easily? They're marvelous! Write them down, lest you forget them. I know them by heart. What a heavy job. Come on, we have to be there before 1 pm. -Move back. To the left. -A little more. -He didn't tip me. -What a stingy guy. Come on, boy! What's wrong with you today that you're not talking? -My head hurts a lot. -Your head? And my back. Come on. Get up. Come on. Get up! I can't, boss. My head hurts a lot. Darn it! Can't you stand up? No boss. I can't. You're very weak. You're burning up with fever. Wait for me. Don't you move until I come back. -I'll go find some money. -Where? Anywhere. You hang in there. Yesterday I said 10 people and there has to be 10. Yes, yes, I understand, but... We can't shoot like this. Pack it up. If this take too long we'll lose this light. I don't care about that. Do you want to dress up for that scene? -I... -If I'm going to get paid... -Of course, 47.50 -Where do I have to go? First, get dressed there. And you too. Come on, hurry up. This one will suit you nicely. You have to have some patience. -There are 7 shots left -Alright. Very good. Hello. What's up? How's it going Jordá? -What do I have to do now? -You're going to be second? And who's first? Quick! Stand here. Next to the others and be alert to my instructions. That's easy-peasy for me. Let's do it. -We can shoot. Let's go. -All set. -Is the clapperboard ready? -Ready. -For how long we have to do this? -The entire day. Poor Chirri. Pay attention to the steps. -At the fifth step shoot. Got it? -Yes. I don't like this fooling around with firearms. -Something can go wrong and then... -You have nothing to worry about. Come on! Be ready. We're going to shoot. -Roll camera. -Camera's speeding. -Action! -Didn't I tell you? -Cut! -What's that man doing? Come on! Where did those bastards hit you? Let's shoot the scene again. Enough! That's enough! Do you see the danger that guns bring? But who told you to do such a stupid thing? Come on, man. -Don't push me around. For lousy 47 pesetas I don't have to put up with all this. Enough, gentlemen. Enough. We're going to shoot again. Come on, Chirri! Get up. We have luck on our side. Thank God I see you. I've had an interminable day. Chirri... Get me out of here, boss. This looks like a niche. Boss! How are you doing, Chirri? How are you doing, kiddo? How are you doing, son? -That's a great hat, boss. -I've become an actor. I'm so cold. -It's just that you have a fever. -I'm shivering. I brought that cheese that you like so much. I brought olives as well. And everything. Look! Have some wine. And milk. -Are you feeling any better? -Not much. I'm done with this! Boss, please don't go! I'm not going anywhere. Keep eating. Cold? I put an end to that. You're going to feel warmer. You'll see the fire I'll make. Come on, Chirri. Let's go over there. -Can you walk? -Yes, sir. How are you feeling, son? Better. What a fire. We just can't live without heat. Isn't that true, Chirri? We have solved the problem. You'll see how soon you'll get better. I have work for 2 or 3 more days. You really can do anything... In order to be an actor you need to have a... ...certain something and a lot of sense. See? But don't get drunk all day, boss. Lest you lose your job. Me? No way! I picked up the wrong bottle. Cigarettes, blonde tobacco. Blonde tobacco and cigarettes for sale. Do you want to get some blonde tobacco or cigarettes? Look at that dog! He looks a lot better than us. Don't worry, you'll have again an overcoat and a top hat just like me. Blonde tobacco for sale. Blonde tobacco for sale. Give me two. Blonde tobacco for sale. -Blonde tab- -Give me a pack of Lucky Strike. We only sell loosies. Have one, Chirri. We also have a right to enjoy life. What are you thinking, boss? Bah! Nothing important. It would be nice to break into those houses... ...and take every last chicken they have there. Is there chicken in the kitchens of the rich? There's everything you may want. You just have to tell the cook: "I want some tripe stew" and they serve you right away. That's awesome! Hey boss! That's Carlos. -Who's Carlos? -The guy who was Marta's boyfriend. -What an old hag! -She's really ugly. Gentleman, let me tell you are a pig. Blonde tobacco and cigarettes for sale. -Oh dear! What is this?! -What's going on? But what happened? Thank you, gentleman. Thank you very much. He hit him first. This gentleman came to my defense after being offended by that clown. -Forget it, man. This lady is making this up. -Making this up? Making this up?! You're on your own. Thank you. Please, come this way. Come on. -Ladies first. -Go ahead. Come Chirri, jump in. -Where is that urchin going? -That's my secretary, ma'am. I have a strong dislike about urchins. He can sit up front with the driver. Give me your name. I can't give you my name. Otherwise how people will call me? -I just want to know your name. -Segundo López. Segundo? Just like the Count of Valdegomete. He was a drunkard... I am Paloma Rebollo de Cereceda y Blanca de San Blás. -Pleased to meet you. -Let's go home, Samuel. Look! (Marquis of Remisa) Another López and with top hat as well. Will you be related? -Does it mention that he's from Cáceres? -No How well that guy dresses. What a house! I am surrounded by enemies. That's why I send the servants to sleep in their homes. A cigar? Cigar smoke kills microbes in the air. My cigar went out, boss. Geez! There is a strong breeze here. -Can I close the window, ma'am? -Don't you touch anything. And call me Miss. I am a miss after all. I am very ill. What would I do without brandy. Don't serve the kid a full glass. Don't throw the ashes on the floor. It's disgusting. Pick them up immediately. Upstairs lives a shady doctor. He's trying to poison me with gases through the central heating pipes. What an animal! That's why I want you guys to go upstairs and beat up Dr. Garrido. -At this time of night? -But won't he be sleeping? Wake him up then. I'll pay you 1000 pesetas for the beating. -What?! -1000 pesetas. Say no more. Where's Dr. Garrido? Upstairs. Come this way. -Is the doctor in? -Come in. Is it urgent? Geez! What a question. -Yes, it's really urgent. -Come this way. Sit down, Chirri. This is backwards. Look, cut the nonsense. Good evening. You were lucky to find me awake. I was working late. We come in behalf of your neighbor from downstairs. Are you really trying to poison her? For God's sake... She's a mentally ill woman. In other words, she's nuts. If you want to get rid of her we can poison her. We only have to agree in the price. No, thank you very much. The poor thing... She's obsessed with the idea that I want to hurt her. I was her family doctor before she went crazy. We both go way back. In that case we're here to give you a good beating. You're a scumbag! Scumbag! Scumbag! Murderer! Come on buddy, grab one. You can play along with her. Here I am at your disposal. Now... If you come back we'll have to split the payment. Good night, doctor. Goodbye, my friend. -Did you hit him too hard? -You don't have to worry about that. That doctor won't be bothering you any more. My wrist hurts from the beating. -And what did you with the servants? -We had to tie them up. And gagged them so they couldn't scream. Come this way. I'll give you the money. Please sit down. Have a drink. -Take it. Hero. -Thank you. You have to leave me your address in case I ever need you again. The thing is that at the moment we don't have a fixed residence. If you want, you can stay here with me as my right hand man. I'm surrounded by enemies after all. I'll pay you 3,000 pesetas a month and you'll keep everyone under control. And whoever disobeys me will get a good beating. But this little rat has to leave. This is not a shelter for urchins. Chirri is my personal secretary and I pay him... ...out of my own pocket. What is mine is his. Well, he can stay then. But he has to take a bath. Sit down. A man like you is just what I need. Brave... Quarrelsome... Invincible! Don't worry. You'll be very pleased with our service. You shut up! -Are you cold, ma'am? -Please, call me... Paloma. Are you cold, Paloma? I can't stand the feel of silverware on my skin. They make me nervous. Scratch my back, Segundo. Stand in a place where you don't give me shade, it makes me very nervous. Slower. That's better. This feels really nice, Segundo. We'll have to do this every morning, afternoon and evening. Do you understand? I understand, Paloma. Fill my glass. You have to disinfect the inside, even if you're not going to live much longer. Don't talk like that, my dear Paloma, you still have many years ahead. Haven't you thought about what happens to us after we die? They're going to bury us. Come here. Haven't you heard about the astral ectoplasm, the manifestation from beyond? Don't you know either that you can communicate with those who have died? -Indeed you can. -Is that true? So I could speak with my mother? Of course. This rascal could be our medium. We'll make the dead talk through him. That's a piece of cake . Let's give it a try. I think we'll manage to communicate. You, idiot, do your best to go into a trance. Yes, ma'am. Come closer. Sleep. Sleep. I command you. Are you asleep? -Yes, Miss. -What do you see? I can't see anything, ma'am. He's already in trance. -What was the name of the deceased? -Escolástica López, at your service. Concentrate and think about her strongly. Escolástica López spirit, answer through the mouth of this urchin to whatever your son has to ask you. Did you hear that? They're already here. -Are you my mother? -Yes, sir. She called me sir... That can't be her. I was never that formal with mother. That was probably just a slip. Ask her again. -Are you my mother? -Yes, my son. Yes! It's her. It's her! It's her! Mother... Mother, how are you doing? Fine. How about you? Fine. Ask her something that you want to know. You left this world without ever telling me who my father was. And I would like to know that. Your father was... Speak. Speak! I'm not really sure. How happy Marta will be when she sees us. We have to get dressed up to annoy Doña Jacinta. -I want to wear a top hat too. -Of course. We have to hurry to get back before the old lady wakes up. Just drive until the shops open. A round of liquor for everyone. And you start playing on my account. Come on! Another round of the best liquor. That's good! Very good! This... This is good. -These artists are great! -The shops are open, boss. Stop the music. Stop! Stop! Get these 3 artists in the cab. We'll keep working. Pass me that ham, Chirri. Come on. We're already here. Come on. I'm really excited. I have an itch for seeing her again. Now you're really in love, boss. You hold still. Understood? When I give you the signal, start playing the pasodoble. Ok. Ready? We're ready, buddy. What's going on? What's all this fuss about? Move out the way, tramp! This orchestra only plays for honest people. -Well? -Yes, boss. 8 days ago. I missed you so much. Now that we were rich. Are you going to pay us? Oh, yes. Here. Get drunk. Take. Thank you. And why do you want so many flowers? Because... What do I know, Chirri. So that poor girl can go to sleep. You're a poet, boss. They're really pretty! Thank you. -That guy has a distinguished bearing. -He looks like a minister. There's the writer, Chirri. How skinny he is. But he has his own world. What would you like? A coffee, a drink and a cigar. And that gentleman over there... Serve him whatever he wants. It's on Don Segundo López. What would you like? Those two gentleman invite you. Thank you. Nothing for now. Drink that glass. To... Well... Just drink it. It's strong. You're a weakling. I'll show you. -See? -You're eyes too are watering. But it isn't due to the brandy. Hey, buddy! Leave those books for a moment and join us for a cigar. Otherwise your brain is going to melt. I accepted the invitation from that stranger. He told me all this that you just saw. A little everyday story. But it hides in its simplicity, the impenetrable justice of God marking the exact minute of every event. That minute that for anyone, at any time, can be the beginning of a better life. So we leave our characters, with the doors to a new hope open in their souls. What a strange guy. We're just like the swallows, we always come and go Perhaps you don't understand me yet, Chirri. I began to live too late. Let's go to the old lady's house. -I'm no longer interested. -Geez, boss. The food was good there. I don't have anything else to do here in Madrid. You are coming with me to Cáceres. Whatever you say. Tomorrow we take the train.
