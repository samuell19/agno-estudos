- Baby? Wake up. - Five more minutes. - Come on, it's time. - Honey, you picked up my shirts, right? Honey? - Uh-huh, I matched up your ties too. Well, since when is apple her favorite anyway? Yeah, I'm not upset. No. - Well, it sounds like you-- - Mom! - Well, if it sounds that way it's because you keep asking me the same question and expecting a different answer. - Mom, it is not in the hamper. - Did you check the dryer? - Yeah. - Okay, just have some eggs. I'm listening. - Is that bad? Uh-huh. - Mom. - Hey, Mom, I'm sorry. I have to go. - At least I can count on you. - Mom. - Okay, fine. - Mom. - All right. - Apple, okay? - Okay, I know. - Mom. - Yes, apple, I know. - Mom. - I promise. Okay, we'll see you then. Bye. - Mom. I have a game and I need my f-ing jersey. - Okay, don't talk like that. And, Ben, please use a plate. - I said f-ing. Not fucking. - Ben! Robby! Rob! Do you know how many diseases those things carry? Rob. - Shit. Do you know how f-ing happy I will be when this thing is done? - Yeah. - How do I look? - You always look great. - But managerial great? - Extremely. I'm calling an exterminator. - Really? I mean, we're barely holding it together and you're gonna spend your last cash on a little mouse? - It's in my house. - It's a little mouse. - I'm not arguing this. - It probably just wants to take a little nibble. - Cut it out. - Right here. - No. - Maybe it's a ticklish mouse. - Stop, stop it! - Everything's okay, right? - Mm-hmm. - Gotta go. - 'Kay. - Bye. - Lee, honey! Come on, let's go! - You're making me late you fat sack of shit! - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Ben, not helping. Go get in the car. Lee? Honey? All right. Have a good day, sweetheart. Do you have everything? - When I had journeyed half our life's way, I found myself within a shadowed forest, for I had lost the path that does not stray. Ah, it is hard to speak of what it was. The savage forest, dense and difficult, which even in recall renews my fear. So bitter, death is hardly more severe, but to retell the good discovered there-- - Fear so bitter death is hardly more severe. That's pretty intense. So, what good do you think he discovered there? Paul? Paul? - Wake up. - That he's not all alone? - Uh-huh. Go on. - That he's got someone... ...a friend... ...who's willing to go all the way through hell to help him. - I guess my voice occasionally reaches the back of the room after all. Hi. - Hey. - So, how'd it go? - They haven't said shit. - Honey, you're gonna get it. It was there, Robby. Watching. - So... a mouse from the kitchen, climbs up here to where there's no food just to hang out and watch you sleep? - Yeah, maybe. Why not? - Okay. Why don't I get the gun from the dresser, and the next time it happens, you can just take care of it? - Please don't say that. - And let the guy who's working 16 hour days get some fucking sleep. - ...crowds. I have to watch the crowd here, and I do try to watch a little of the game at the same time, extremely tough. - ...late in the second half, 19 seconds left. The coach is pressured and tosses up a lame duck that's picked off by linebacker... - Damn it. Lee, honey. Come on. - Mom! He won't get out of the bathroom! - Okay, well just give him a minute. - He's messing with his hair. Or jerking off! - I don't need to hear that. - That's why we're always out of tissues. - Oh, for God's sake. - You know what? Fuck it! I'm going back to bed. - Don't you dare! Ben, let your brother in there right now! Do you hear me? Yes, that is what I said, attacked. No, it attacked me. Uh-huh. Could you maybe rearrange something? Anything? Yes! Oh, that's perfect! Thank you. Okay, great. - Ladies, I'd like you to meet my wife. - Hey, there. - Oh, hi, Paul. How are you? - Since class? The same, I guess. Put it on his account, right? - Uh-huh. Hey, you wanna give me a hand? - Huh? - I could use your expert dough rolling skills. - No. - Okay. - Hey, how are you? Hello. - Hi, Mom. - Oh, this is nice. You get a haircut? - No. - Come on in. - How is she? - Horrible. Hardly eats. I just made her a cup of tea. She probably won't touch it. - Has she made it out of bed at all? - She just mainly lays around puffing away. The whole place stinks like hell. They told us, "Well, just let her be," so we're letting her be. This is apple, right? - Uh-huh. - Good, she's really looking forward to it. - 'Kay. - Go say hi to your sister. - Oh, I'll just wait for her to come down. - Holly, go say hi to your sister. - Okay. Claudia? - Remember that day? - Hey. You scared me. - Doesn't it blow your mind how much we've changed? Oh, I missed you. I missed you so fucking much. - I missed you, too. What? - You mean it? - Come on. I'm so happy you're okay. He's better equipped to fight this place than we are. - I'm wondering if we should be here at all. - Why don't you catch a bus and go home? - Don't think I wouldn't if I could find one. - There he is. - I'm just saying, use this time here with us as an opportunity to reevaluate things and then-- - Because reevaluating things is what landed me there in the first place. Touchy topic. - Sweetie, you're just taking this all wrong. - We love you. We are here for you and want to help you find another path. - Right, yeah. Yeah, and what path would that be? - Look, you're a bright girl. You should have something practical to focus on, to dedicate yourself to. Like your sister. - Hey, I know it's not glamorous, but I could probably get you a job at the market. - Wow, yeah, now there's an idea. Bagging groceries at 33, I mean that's a dream come true. - So, maybe it's not ideal, but it's a new start and a way of getting settled in. - What a failure. I mean, that's what you think, right? Just say it. What a complete and total failure. - Oh, come on. - That's not true. That's just not true. - I certainly have no intention of sticking around here. That's for sure. - Well, we'll talk about that later. But, now, look here what Holly made for you. That's your favorite, that's the kind you like. - Hmm, looks great. Come on, hon. Sit down. - Oh, I hope you like it. - Now, I taste heat. Is there heat? - Yep, my taste buds are on high alert. - A little spicy hon. - Oh, it's mostly the chili pepper. And the cinnamon, I let it all soak in. - God, now, I never woulda tried that. - Claud, you're not having any? - Hmm-mmm. But I'm sure it's delicious. Right, everyone? - Oh, yeah, perfect. - Yeah. - Wow, perfect. See, Holly's a real gourmet chef, too. - Bravo. - You know, I think you probably got it from Nana. Right, Mom? - If there's anything we'd have gotten from my mother, it would have been her cooking. - Oh, her cooking, yeah. Ah, that brings back memories. You remember, Holly, the time with Nana? - We had lots of times with her. - Oh, yeah, for sure, for sure. I meant the one with the pie. You remember that day? You remember. Oh, Holly. Oh, Holly. Oh, come on. You can't still be upset about it. - I'm not upset I just . - Oh, good, you're not upset. So we actually made a pinky promise never to talk about it again. - Then don't talk about it. We were kids. - Right and now we're all grownups here and it's just a funny story. - Sorry, what are we talking about? - Nothing. She's drunk. Should you even be drinking? - I'm not drunk. - She is not drunk. She can have one drink and it's a funny story. Go ahead and tell the story. - Fine.- It is a funny story. It's a funny story. Thank you, Rob. Okay, so Nana made this pie and she left it out to cool overnight. And the next morning, we wake up and it's gone. So we searched all over the place and we finally find the pie plate back in the cupboard all washed and cleaned. Like Nana never even made it. Like it never even existed. - Sorry, but I'm lost. What happened to the pie? - Well, I saw her bake it. You know, we all did. But we also knew where it probably went, because we knew who loved pie the most. Little... Holly... Hippo. - Okay, it was mean then and it's ridiculous now. As ridiculous as that story. - You gonna admit you ate it? - I did not. - She's still such a goddamn liar. - Hey, hey! - As usual, blame the fat girl! - What? Not anymore! - Not what she's saying. - That's enough. - I mean you're practically anorexic. She totally ate it. - Go around. Okay, yes, I see you. Go around. What is your problem? Go around! - Hey! Come on! Hey! Move it you stupid cunt! - I'm here! Oh, my God. - You're drooling. - You gonna talk about last night? - I was tired. I'd had enough. - Right. Hey, take it easy. You had your phone off. You had your mom really worried. - Excuse me. - Okay, you know what? You're starting to freak me out here. When I came home last night, you were asleep downstairs. Mumbling... saying some shit... I don't even know. - So, why didn't you just wake me up? - I tried. I put my hand on your forehead. You were burning up. You looked me straight in the eye. I tried to help you get up, and then you did this. Do you not remember? - No. I don't. Bye. Have a good day. - Chill, man. - Settle down, guys. - Throw it back, throw it back. - Hand it over. - It's private. - Nope, not anymore. What has gotten into you? Office. Now! Now! - They need to up his meds. Psycho. - Oh, that's wonderful, sweetheart. Of course I'm happy. Of course, no, no, I am. I'm just relieved you got it. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, I'm feeling much better. Well, now, I am. Go home. Right here? - Yes. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Oh, holy shit. How cool is that? How does it feel now that Rob is the regional fucking manager of a-- - Shh. - Shh. - Thanks, honey, this looks great. - I wish someone did something like this for me. - I made you a pie yesterday. - Oh, right. - Go to the bathroom, please. - She's drunk. So are you. - Yeah, I had a few. - A few? - Yeah, celebrating with the guys. Then, she walks in all hysterical after fighting with your mom. She thinks you hate her, by the way. - Don't talk to me about her. - What, she has problems! What do you want me to do, leave her there? - Yes! This is suppose to be our time. - I know, I know it. Look, just relax. It's okay. - It is not okay. - So what are you guys talking about? - Nothing, just how lucky I am and how great this cake looks. - Oh, yeah. Mmm! Mmm, seriously, I don't know how you do it. What? - You know, the night Nana made that pie, you couldn't know what happened, because you weren't even there. - Uh, yeah, I was. - No. No, no, no. You were too busy getting... Oh, what's the expression? Oh, yeah. Finger banged by Danny Hendersonnext door in his garage. Oh, Danny! That feels so good, Danny! Oh, yeah, put another finger in! - Whoa! - God, were you watching me? - But I'm the one who got slapped around. I could have told Nana, but I didn't. I didn't try to deliberately humiliate you. - Eat up. - Eat up, guys. - Two killed nearby. Car crash. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Both dead. - Oh, Jesus. - I know, terrible to be killed like that. - See, you guys, you should take that as a warning when you start driving. Oh, hey, good morning. Here you go. Would you like some coffee? Look, I actually cooked and it's not a total disaster. - Oh, I have to get ready. - Hey. I can take the boys. - I'm fine. - I want you to take the day off. - No, Rob, I'm fine. - When was the last time you took it easy? - Yeah. - 'Kay? - Okay. - Everything's gonna be great. - All right. - You guys ready? - Paul! Where is he? My husband! - Are you getting me fired? Try the back. In storage. Can I have my book back? You can rip out those pages if you want but... Please? It's really important. Hey, are you okay? It's not about what I did, is it? - What you did? - The pictures? What? - Could you... Could you please hold me? - Yeah. Is this okay? Hey! Whoa, hey! Hey, oh, hold on a second. Slow down. - I have to go. - Hey. What's the matter? Honey? Honey? Ow! What the fuck are you doing? I won't lose you. What? Holly! Are you even awake? - I don't know. - Well, you better fucking figure it out. Jesus Christ! You know, I'm getting tired of being the punching bag... - I killed them. - ...between you and your goddamn weirdo family. What did you say? - Those two kids in the... ...in the paper. I was the one. I ran them off and... I tried to tell you. I saw you. I saw you. - You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - Please look at me. - Get your goddamn meds checked. - Where are you going? - Who would like to read next? Michelle. - The heavy sleep within my head was smashed by an enormous thunder clap, so that I started up as one whom force awakens. I stood erect and turned my rested eyes from side to side and I stared steadily to learn what place it was surrounding me. In truth, I found myself upon the brink of an abyss. The melancholy valley containing thundering, unending wailings. That valley, dark and deep and filled with mist, such that while I gazed into its pit, I was unable to discern a thing. - Hey. - Oh. Sorry, I don't have time to talk about your essay. I'm late for an appointment. - You think I'm gonna say something? - Oh, um. You would have gotten a better grade if you'd focused more on proving your thesis. - I won't. - And I also think an outline would have been really helpful just to, you know, organize your thoughts and-- - I think you're beautiful and that no one understands you. Not in this shitty fucking place. - Okay. - He doesn't deserve you. - Stop it! Stop! Jesus! - I wouldn't hurt you. - I'm upping your sleep meds. - Do you think that'll stop the dreams? - Couldn't say. But you know what'll really help? - What? - That you believe me that you don't have rabies. Just keep it clean and dressed and you'll be fine, okay? - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. - You know, we had mice chew through the drywall and the only thing that seemed to work was some over-the-counter stuffin a little peanut butter. - Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob! - I won it in the arcade. The thing with the claw. It reminds me of you. I know it's kind of dumb. - No. Thanks. - Look at me. - What? - Look at me. - I'm looking. - Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! - What are you doing? - Look at me! - Jesus! Fuck! What was that? - Get out. - What did you see? - Get out! - Hello? - Come on. Come here. Kiss me. - Okay. - Kiss me. - Okay. - Come here. - Rob. - Come on, please. - Oh, what are you doing? - Come on. Lay here. It's all gonna be good now. I'm gonna get us out of here. - Is it always gonna be like this? - Hmm? - Is it? - Yes. - Good morning. - Yeah, I wouldn't know. - I won't bother asking if you'll be home early. - Yeah, don't. Inventory night. My last one. I like the quiet without the boys around. - Holly? I know you're there! Come on, I need to talk for a minute. I'm taking off, so you won't have to see me again for God knows how long. I don't wanna leave things like this. Boo! - God! - Too busy baking to answer the door? - I'm not feeling well. You could have called. You didn't have to break in. - It was unlocked and you don'treturn my calls, remember? - What is it? - I'm subletting a place. Mom is being a total bitch. - Uh-huh. - You know I didn't plan on coming by. - So why did you? - I saw you walk out last night... ...with that kid. - So? - So? I know about mistakes. And some are easier to fix than others. Hey! Hey, it's okay. Breathe. Breathe! - You have no idea what you're talking about. - Well, something's going on. I can see it all over you. Just ignore it. Come on, ignore it, seriously! - Stop! - It's probably just Mom calling to bitch about me. - Hello. - Hi, sweetheart. - Hi, Mom. - Told you. Just hang up on her. - Yeah, yeah, last night was fine. Of course. Thanks for taking care of the boys. They giving you any trouble? Yeah, I know she's leaving. Well, what do you want me to say? It's her life. No, I'm not taking her side... - What is your fucking problem? - You need to leave now. - Oh, my god! You're bleeding, you psycho! - For God's sakes, you're stressing me out. - Well, then calm the fuck down. - I will when you leave. - What is going on? What just happened? Are you all right? - Hey, I'm okay, Mom. I'm gonna call you back later. - Holly... - What's wrong with you? - You. You're ruining my day. - I'm ruining? I'm trying to help you. - You can't even help yourself! How long until the next rehab? And the one after that? - That is not fair. - You're cruel and selfish. You crawl all over people and use them up like a parasite. Like with Mom and me and both your ex-husbands and every other loser you've ever screwed. I can't stand you, Claud. And I don't want you in my home, or around my family anymore. So, please... ...please just get out! - Wow! You have changed. - Boys? Lee? No... - Mom! - Sweetheart. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. Please, God, no! Baby? Baby?! Oh no, no! No! You're okay. You're okay. No, God! - Holly? Let me help you. - You're looking at me. You're looking. - Baby. No. Sweetheart, Holly. Baby. God!
