I can't concentrate because of you. It's not the first time you've heard this. My eardrums are gonna pop! Doesn't this sound great? After your military service, I thought you'd grow up. Anyway, you can't car race. It's too dangerous. Hey, Dae-jin. Look for other work while helping me out like old times. Your work is just as dangerous. You always cut your hand. Over 10,000 people die a year from car accidents. But I haven't seen anyone die from a car race yet. Ho-jin. Step aside. You worry too much. I can't die that easily. Be careful. Mr. Choi, check the singers' MR tape. Okay. Mr. Jun, check the moving lights. Take a look. OK! Mr. Choi, check the monitor speaker. - Please hurry. Over here. - Yes. Go inside the dome instead of Hyun-woo. Yes. It has to be checked properly. It has to open during the concert. Why not? It'll be fun. Sure. Getting trapped instead would be fun, huh? - It won't open! - Open it up! I didn't do it. Don't turn on the master so fast. Thanks. Hello? Yes. Really? From the 16th to the 18th? Yes. But the exhibition will last for only three days. Yes. I'd like it to be for a week though. Yes. Then please ask around again. Thank you. Bye. How'd you time it perfectly? It's pouring. - Hungry, huh? - Yes. This song. Don't you remember it? It's my favorite song. It's nice hearing it in the rain. Here. It's a present. What's with you today? Thank you. That's all? I love you. What's this? What's gotten into you today? You made all this? Of course. But it's not my birthday, and yours is much later than mine. Hey, Eun-soo. It's our anniversary, dummy. My goodness, you're right. I totally forgot. I'm sorry, Ho-jin. There's one more thing. It's the most valuable thing to you, but the chain was always a problem. Eun-soo, I love you. Honey. It's like as if my dad sent you to me. Why? Whatever my dad makes, it becomes precious no matter how trifling it is. Even this necklace, he made it out of peach flower seeds when I was a kid. I know. That's why you deserve this much. There's only one like this in the world, huh? But I'm sorry I didn't prepare anything. Then how about I steam you up tonight? Really? Tonight? Sure. Bastard. What perfect timing. He's too big to live with us, huh? Shall we get him married? Shall we? Yeah. But right after I said it, it really didn't open. I'm serious. No way. I must have some telekinetic power. Do it. Do what? Do it. Okay, I'll give it a try. Look straight into my eyes. Yawn. Should I do it on Dae-jin, too? Hiccups. Sorry, I guess I can't. He did it. I really had to. - It switched. - Stop joking around. No, it was real. Don't joke with... Come on. No, mine was real, too. It was real? Yeah. I'll go drink some water. Come here. No, I have to go drink some water. Stop joking around. I'm serious. Dae-jin, don't you want a girlfriend? The best times are at your age. I like it now. Like what? Fiddling with your car in the garage? I'm curious as to what's in that mind of yours. I'm going to bed so you two drink up. - Good night. - You, too. I'll be in soon. Dae-jin. Make sure you block your ears tonight. - Good night. - You, too. I've never seen you neat freak who can't close a lid right. Thanks a lot for today. It's nothing. I'm so happy. You still have the hiccups? No, I'm okay. You still have them. There's no use tonight. Let's just go to bed. It stopped. It stopped? It did. Really? You're doing it again. Just go to sleep. Ho-jin. Yeah. You're supposed to put it all the way on. That's because it's used up. I'll buy it later. I think a lot of reporters are coming to my exhibition. Dae-jin. Act like a reporter and ask me questions. So I can practice. Come on, that's dumb. Just this once. Mr. Hwang Ho-jin, please explain your work. Yes. From the furniture we commonly see, I felt like I twisted them a little. Similar to Marcel Duchamp's toilet, I recreated what we commonly see. Furniture... Ho-jin. You practiced a lot, huh? Does it show? Of course. Be a little artsy and inarticulate. As if it just came to you, and say 'and' a lot. Also, smiling and lifting your eyes is better. You're right. Do it again. Mr. Hwang Ho-jin, please describe your work. Yes. From the furniture... we commonly see... How can I put it? I twisted them a little. That is... Ho-jin. Just do it like before. Bastard. You did well. Oh, hi. What are you doing? They say pollacks can look far with their big eyes, and can eat a lot with their big mouths. Then how could they get caught then? You're right. If I get hungry while driving, I'm gonna eat it. Do as you please. Whether you cook or fry it, I'll put it here for your sake, so be careful. Thanks, Ho-jin. Ho-jin. It's your favorite dish. Hey. Is Dae-jin still in the garage? Wait. Wait. What are you doing? I don't have the hiccups today. So what? What if Dae-jin comes? He's leaving soon. Wait. Is it bothering you? Do something with the table. Okay, just a sec. Aren't you going to fast? I can handle it. He's taking it too hard from the beginning. I told him to pace himself and go slow. Would a drug addict listen if you said to inject slowly? What's he doing? I don't know. Might be engine trouble. You exhausted the engine. The race isn't far away, so don't blow the engine. Don't use too much RPM. I didn't overdo it. It'll be fine. Your record's improving, so I'll let it pass. But racing isn't all about luck. Take caution. I got it. Hey, the car's in great shape. Damn it. I should've been born a car. Good job everyone. A coin that brought you pleasure? Eun-soo. Huh? You got another love letter today? You're so lucky. For what? You've been married for three years, but you still exchange love letters? You're so lucky, Eun-soo. I wish I could meet a guy like that. It won't be too easy. Can't there be a guy like Ho-jin? What? Ho-jin. But the letter's not finished. That's okay. - Sleep well? - Oh, yes. You must've came in late last night. Yeah, I had a drink with Yae-joo. I'm out of lotion, so I came for Ho-jin's. - It's on the dresser. - Okay. That's our business, Dae-jin. It was just here, but I wasn't looking at it. If you're done, then please leave. We live in the same house, but you two are unfair. So hurry and get married. Okay. Ho-jin. Look at this. Hello. Hello. You're here early, Yae-joo. Of course. It's an important day for Dae-jin. You're the only one who thinks of him. Ho-jin, this came off. I'll fix it later. The more I see it, the prettier it is. There's only one like this in the world. I'm so jealous. - Stay for a while. - Okay. You and Dae-jin seem to hit it off. I wish. It was better when he took pictures. I feel like I'm left in the cold now. He always worries me when he car races. You should change his mind. Think he will if I tell him? Hey, am I invisible now? - What's up? - Hey. Ho-jin, I'm leaving now. - You're going now? - Yeah. Going to the race, right? Of course. Tell him good luck for me. I will. I'll see you later. Be careful driving. See you later. - Have a nice day. - Okay. Oh no. Drivers please come to the record room for tests. Five minutes left until the race begins. Did Ho-jin say he'll come? Yeah, he did. He doesn't like me racing, so he might not. Then why are you if your brother opposes it? Because I like it. Drivers please report to the waiting area. Hey, good luck! Welcome. To Yongin Speedway please. I'm very late. I have to be there by one. Wow, you're really late. I'll go fast. It's the third Korea Motor Championship. 1st place in the GT Class, Indigo's Kim Yi-soo. He took pole position in the last match. 3rd place was the wild horse, Bak Joon-woo of Oilbank. Fourth was Hwang Dae-jin. Feeling good, huh? - And don't pass up the in course. - Okay. Remember, you're buying tonight. I know. Three minutes left until the race. The gates are closing. Please clear away from the grid. The sign board is up. Start your engines. I screwed up on corner three. What's my time? Present lap time is 1:08:07. You're doing alright. Aren't you going too fast? I thought you were late. Right. Don't worry. I've been accident free for 10 years. Even as a speed taxi. It's the 7th head pin, so slow it down. He wants to kill himself! He's scaring me! The steering wheel is strange. I'm going in. Hurry up! What happened? The steering wheel shakes too much. Check the tires fast. Check the tires! Dae-jin, please be careful. How much am I behind? 0.3 seconds behind in lap time. Run the course instead of placing. No, I have to place. You still have more to go, so it's okay. Be careful. The traffic lights aren't cooperating today. Dae-jin, there's trouble on the course. Slow down! Dae-jin! What? What did you say? I can't hear you well. His pulse rate and brain waves are improving, but he still can't wake up. It's too bad. Dr. Lee, what happened to this patient? Didn't I tell you? Both brothers got into a car accident. His older brother got hit by a truck while in a taxi. So he's pretty much dead. I guess so. But the younger one was in a car race accident. What a strange world. But is there any hope for this patient? I don't know. Are you okay? Jung-woo, match the steps. You're falling back. You're supposed to turn there. Young-eun! Are you checking the distance? They're off. Mr. Kim, please check the lights. There are shadows on the models' faces. Hello? Oh, hello. What? Please rest for now. It's really fortunate that you at least have come back. Are you okay? Get up. Go rest in your room. Hey, Dae-jin! Thanks for being alive. You were lying there like a corpse, and I was helpless, thinking you'd leave forever. I'm just really happy that you're alive. You were a heavy smoker before. While you were in bed, know how stupid I acted? I went all the way to the junkyard. I wanted to see your car get totally demolished. When I went to see it, I laughed a lot. You were in bed like that, and I was jealous of that car. I was acting overboard. But now I'm just really thankful that you've come back. Yae-joo. Hi, Eun-soo. Is Dae-jin really alright? Dae-jin. What are you doing? Have a seat. Did you buy that flower? No. I thought you bought it. Was Dae-jin always a good cook? The way he cuts vegetables is amazing. Sit. Yae-joo, too. Hurry and eat. Dae-jin. Right now, this is all that I can do for you. Now eat. Dae-jin. Dae-jin... Mr. Hwang Dae-jin. - After you woke up... - My name is Hwang Ho-jin. Any other symptoms besides headaches? Sometimes my ears ring. I'm cold. And I keep getting sleepy. But doctor, I'm Hwang Ho-jin. What happened to me? From a psychologist's perspective, his depression and hysteria have sprung up in a peculiar way after his trauma. On the surface, he believes he's Hwang Ho-jin. But the problem is that his consciousness firmly believes that he's possessed. Possessed? If I explain it simply, the body is taken over by someone else's spirit. The best way to know is to find proof of his believe from his unconscious. Doctor. How can this be possible? Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Your hand. Oh no. Eun-soo, he cut his hand. He kept saying he's Ho-jin. Wait. My hands aren't listening to me. I don't know how this happened. Dae-jin, hurry and go inside first. Yeah, let's hurry, Dae-jin. I'm not Dae-jin. I don't know. I don't know why I'm like this. Hey. Pull yourself together. You're Hwang Dae-jin. You're the Hwang Dae-jin. I've always liked! Eun-soo, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Yae-joo. Dae-jin is still sick. He's doing this because he's still mentally unstable. When time passes, he'll be better. That bastard. He's trying to suck me dry forever. I'll be back after I give this to him. The gift your father gave you. I've finally fixed it. - Can you hear my voice? - Yes. Tell me your name. Hwang Ho-jin. Good. You're falling into a calmer and deeper sleep. Imagine a cloud. A soft wind is blowing. The cloud is moving slowly. Very slowly. Now look slowly below the cloud. What do you see? A road. What's on top of this road? A taxi. Taxi. Are you riding in this taxi? I don't know. You're moving forward. Slowly. What do you see in front of you? What do you see? Calm down. Put your mind at ease. Common symptoms for possessed patients are a drop in their temperature and feeling very cold. They keep sleeping, and even their ears ring. But doctor how could my husband's soul... Even modern psychology can't prove whether possession exists or not. By simply acknowledging it and nursing him is better. Take your medicine. How I'm acting now... I'm not sick, Eun-soo. I understand. But you have to take this medicine. Eun-soo. Eun-soo, open the door. Eun-soo, open the door. I'm not going to do anything. Eun-soo. I'm sorry. I didn't want to do this. But being alone in that room is too hard for me. Don't go. I'm scared, Eun-soo. If I sleep in that room alone, I feel like I'll never wake up. I'm very frightened. Being with Dae-jin is too hard on me. I feel like I'm unconsciously looking for Ho-jin in him. No. Honestly, I saw him. I'm so confused. I feel like I know what you're going through. Eun-soo. I finished my thesis, so I have a lot of time now. If it's okay that I spend time with him, he'll get better. When you were in the marines, you said it was hell, but you felt peaceful. If we work our butt off at my family's ranch, that mildew in your head will wash away. Yae-joo. Where can I go? I'm not going anywhere. This is my place. Eun-soo agreed with me. Eun-soo did? Yes, your sister-in-law. If I just stay here like this, everything will turn back to normal. Hey, how long will you keep this up? Are you planning to drive us crazy? Eun-soo is having it hard enough taking care of Ho-jin. Seeing him in a coma for over a year is hell enough. What did you just say? Look. Look very carefully. That's Hwang Dae-jin's face. Know do you get it? Do you? If it's that hard on you, I'll become Dae-jin. I'll live like Dae-jin. Scared, huh? Cutting grass, chasing and milking cows. You'll probably pass out. But don't worry. I'll help you. Ho-jin. It's Eun-soo. I see that my Ho-jin is still sleeping. I thought you hated being lazy. So how could you sleep this long? I've changed a lot lately. I get angry with people a lot, and I don't laugh easily. If you saw me, you'd be surprised. I can't remember your voice. The harder I try, the more I can't remember. I wish you'd call me just once. Eun-soo. Hey, Eun-soo. Without you, I can't do anything. Go! Hey. You're working up a real sweat. Trying hard to make my family rich? Dae-jin. Leave me alone if you want to make me into Dae-jin. Since you're not complaining and whining, you're no fun at all. Fine. I guess I'll just be a one-woman band forever. I'll play drums with you sometimes. Bang, bang. Hey. Like you, if I could become someone else, then I wish I had never met you. Then I could've made about 100 guys like me. Hey. Look. When you do this, you're totally Dae-jin. Now you laugh for me? I tried so hard to see it just once. Hey. I don't care who you are. You're simply someone who I love. Also, I'm going to hold on to that love. Until I die. I'm sorry. I had no choice but to come back. For Eskimos, when someone they love dies, they gather and talk about that person for five days. While they talk, they erase their memories of that person. Afterwards, they never talk about that person again. If they do, then that person's soul can't rest in peace. Let's talk about Ho-jin. About everything you and I know. Eun-soo. And then never talk about him again. After you left to serve, I begged Ho-jin to go over his place. Stop it, Eun-soo. It was about the end of June. It rained the whole day. When I got there, his place was flooded in. While we poured water out all day, Ho-jin said, Feels like the world has flooded, and we're the only two left. To raise money for your tuition, did you know that he worked in a factory for two months? I was worried so I went to him, and saw him limping while carrying bricks. I wanted to take him out of there, but I couldn't. I thought he'd be more upset if he knew I came, so I couldn't. No one knows. No one can know. How we met. How we loved. No one knows. It was exactly on June 28th. And it started raining from the afternoon. While pouring out the water, you said, I wish the world swept away, and we were the only two left. I couldn't bare watching you, and told you to stop, but you silently scooped the water. A man can never leave a woman, who overcame an obstacle with him. I worked at the factory for one and a half months. It was a Saturday. You suddenly... You came right before lunch. After getting yelled at, I turned around, and saw a girl with a yellow shirt walking away. I also saw you that day. I wanted to call you, I wanted to grab you, But I couldn't. Seeing me like that, I thought make you upset. I knew how you'd feel, so I couldn't call you. Stop it. Eun-soo. Whenever you laughed or became upset, I was always with you. So that's why we're the same inside. You know better. Stop it. Stop. Look. Look at me, Eun-soo. It's me. Can't you see? I should've died then, but I couldn't. I should've died, and be gone forever, but I couldn't. Because of you. No one can love you as much as me. That's why I returned. Remember this, right? How could you not? All the memories that are hidden in our home are proof that we've loved each other until now. Ho-jin. Ho-jin. Eun-soo. You're all that I have. Let's buy bananas. I don't want to. Why? I don't like bananas. But it's for our baby. You're out of lotion, right? Should we buy it? I brought your lunch. Is it going well? Yep. I'm going to have an exhibition. I feel a lot better now. That's great. Don't overwork yourself. Okay. What's wrong? Because you're pretty. Why do you keep laughing? Because you're pretty. It's good to see you a lot happier now. Does it show? Yae-joo. I'm okay. Anyway, it feels strange. I tried so hard to bring Dae-jin back, but suddenly, I thought what difference would it make. Since Dae-jin thought of me only as a friend. I'm sorry, Yae-joo. I didn't want to... But Yae-joo, he's really Ho-jin. I always felt my father was with me after he died. Even though I can't see him, it feels the same with Ho-jin. He's really Ho-jin. I know. That Dae-jin isn't someone I can love. He's someone else now. And it's not like we can share the same person. It's a complicated fate. But I'm glad to see Dae-jin happy before I leave. You two have to live happily. Mine and Dae-jin's worth. I'll go say bye to Dae-jin... I mean Ho-jin before I leave. Had it hard because of me, huh? Because of who? Dae-jin or Ho-jin? So you're studying abroad? Yeah. When will you come back? If I do? Will you become Dae-jin then? Can I think of you as Dae-jin and say something? You're a rotten bastard. Have a good life. Hey. Whether you're Dae-jin or Ho-jin, give me a hug. You really must not be Dae-jin. Dae-jin never gave me a warm hug like this before. One sec. Hello? Oh, hi. Yes, it's Hwang Ho-jin. You remembered. Yes... So I'll be ready for the exhibition in about a week I think. I'd like about two days in advance to set it up. Yes. I see. Wouldn't just one banner out in front be good enough? Yes. And for the opening and closing ceremonies, I'd like a sufficient. It's because of traffic, and I'd like to focus a lot on the opening party. Yes. Thank you. Bye. To be honest, he's been brain dead for too long. And some of his body parts are rotten. I'm sorry to tell you this, but for the patient's sake, I think it's good to send him away. The latest test results show a lost of corneal reflexes. Reflexes in the spinal cord have been lost. Even after the latest test, the patient's brain waves were flat for 30 minutes. With the test results as proof, we confirm Hwang Ho-jin as brain dead. Hwang Ho-jin is now deceased. Yes, I'll see you in a bit. Okay. - Please look around. - Thank you. Ho-jin, I'll go home and come back tonight. Why? Not feeling well? Your face looks bad. I just feel a bit dizzy. Go get some rest then. Eun-soo. Why'd you come out? I wanted to see you leave. Can you drive? Of course. Come here. I don't want you to leave. I'll go rest a little and come back. When you go home... call me. Okay. Boy, he scared me. Go back in. Go. Who is it? I have a package for you. A package for you. Please sign here. Thank you. I thought you might need the original so I'm returning it. Even when I'm lying dead in my coffin, I still won't be able to understand your sick love. Before then, I hope I forget you. Wouldn't just one banner out in front be good enough? Yes. And for the opening and closing ceremonies, I'd like a sufficient amount of time. It's because of traffic, and I'd like to focus a lot on the opening party. Yes. Thank you. Bye. Like what Marcel Duchamp intended to do with the toilet, I wanted to make things common to us closer to real life. So there are a lot of images, like flowers and butterflies. Eun-soo's Dandelions I saw a girl today. She was like the sunshine of September. The moment I caught all the sadness within me disappeared. I don't know how to explain this strong feeling. What are you so nervous about? No, I'm not. For someone who's clueless about women, I'm very curious as to who she is. I met my brother's woman. - Sorry I'm late. - It's okay. Dae-jin, right? Dae-jin say hello to Han Eun-soo. - The world... - Hi. abandoned me. Even the skies. Today is the happiest day of my brother's life. After today, his life will be even happier. Since Eun-soo will be with him. I'm also a happy person. I'll be able to see Eun-soo forever. From behind. Ho-jin told me everything about his times with Eun-soo. Ho-jin doesn't know women. So I told him how to write love letters. And through his letters, Eun-soo became happier. Ho-jin said he's lucky to have a brother like me. I'm a luckier guy. Seeing that I haven't gone insane yet, living under the same roof with them. To give a pure and fairy-tail like feeling, and to make it pleasurable, was my intention. Furniture is something that people are very familiar with. But they easily forget its actual existence. Dae-jin, don't you want a girlfriend? The best times are at your age. I like it now. Like what? Fiddling with that car of yours in the garage? Of course. Just with that I'm happy enough. Sometimes I want to just throw it all away, but I can't. I can't think of anything else, and I don't want to. I think I'll be like this until I die. Since it's next to me, I like it. I can always see it, and feel it. I like this a lot. You're here. Did everything go well? So are you okay now? This piece. To make this, you stayed up for three days, huh? Are you really okay? Yes. This is the door to heaven. If I were to explain it, I made it thinking that death isn't a scary thing after all. Think it gives off a pretty and warm feeling? Yeah. And this? This is Alice in Wonderland. I made it to be fun and cute, while thinking of our baby. There's a mirror inside, too. That'll look better at our doorway. Sounds good. Since it's blue, it'll feel fresh. And we can put the CDs on it. You haven't seen this, huh? Yes. Oh yeah, you saw this while I was working on it. I saw. My brother... My kind brother... You lived while sacrificing your life for me. But did you know this? That I loved Eun-soo first? I loved her enough to abandon myself. But Eun-soo never knew. All she thought of was you. Yes, my brother. I'm not in this world anymore. I'm the one who really died. I'm going to become you and love Eun-soo now. Eun-soo will think of you when she's with me, while loving only you. Ho-jin. Ho-jin. You can never forgive me, right? Don't forgive me. Never. Don't ever forgive me. Ho-jin, I'm sorry.
