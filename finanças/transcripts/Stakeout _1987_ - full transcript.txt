What did I tell you about screwing around with my books? I didn't touch your fag rags, you understand? Who's touching them then? There's only you and me in here! Piss off! Don't fuckin' tell me to piss off. I just did, asshole. We got a problem in a cell downstairs. Hey, Billy! Give it to him! Do it! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! God! Will you take it easy! All right, put him up here. Ahhh! Fuck you. Don't move. Doc, keep your shoes in one place, man. Fuck you too. Hey... Hey! Stick, we gotta go! I want to ask you a question. Do you think it's humane To pump perfectly sane prisoners Full of filoxin and thorazine? Come on, man, let's get out of here. All right, we got Three minutes. Let go. Let go, man! Get in the box! Get in the box! Ow! Okay, see you next week. Right. Night. Good night, thanks. Are we out? Are we out? Yeah. Yeah? Who's this? Uh, that's, uh, Maria McGuire. She came a couple times to visit Montgomery. 2221 Speck Road, Seattle. Is that address current? I hope so. That's all we got. May I? Thank you. Hey, you want these eggs hot? You want me freeze them? Come on, pick them up! Thank you. Don't get your hands too close to his mouth. Anything else? Yeah, I'd like another coffee, please. Okay. And a side order of sausage! You bet. How long has he been in there? About ten minutes. That is disgusting. Really? Do you eat like that in front of your mother? It's an old family custom. It's not healthy. You gotta take your time. Do you have any idea what that does to your digestive system? No, but I'm afraid you're gonna tell me. You've got to savour the qualities of the cuisine. First the smell... For Christ's sake... There he is. Come on, let's go. Pay the cheque. There he is. He's not here. You check upstairs; I'll take the docks. Oh, no, no... I picked up the check; you take the fish. Oh, shit! You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Bill! Bill! Stop! Police! Bill! Pardon me. Excuse me. Sorry... my fault. Sorry. Oh god, oh god. What do you think you're doing? Hey! Freeze! Lace your fingers above your head And turn around towards me. Now you're under arrest. Get back! Whoa! Chris! God, I hate this part. * I'm on fire... * desire... Took you long enough. * My one desire * desire to win... Free air, man, free air. You don't know what this means. You have no idea. Let's move. Hi, Bernie, I'd like some prints. And there's blood on the blade. I'd like to have it typed. Thank you. What is that smell? Chris, oh, oh... Somebody's been in a fight, Jack. What, nobody in cuffs here? This means something... Wait a minute. I think that means Somebody got their ass kicked. Complaints. I'm Bernie. Okay. God, you stink! Hey, guys? Captain wants to see you in his office ASAP. ASAP? I'd like to take a shower first. Please. I wish you would, but by the sound of his voice I think he'll see you as is. Wait a minute, chuckles. Captain wants to see you, too. What did you do now? What the hell happened to you? You look like you got your ass kicked. No, no, don't sit there. Shut the door. Gentlemen, this is Agent Thomas Lusk From the regional FBI Headquarters. Detective Bill Reimers... Hey, Billy. That's Chris Lecce over there. Chris. Ah, Phil Coldshank. Pleasure. And Jack Pismo. Right on. He said, "right on." The FBI Has requested help Over the next couple of weeks So your cases have been reassigned. Whoa, reassigned? We are close to breaking this... A forklift, wasn't it? From now on you're working full time on this. - Kleenex, please. - In the drawer there. Mr. Lusk is in charge of this operation So I'll let him to the talking. I don't know if you're familiar with Montgomery But in case you're not, two years ago He killed one of our agents. He shoulda had the chair, but he had a sharp attorney And the local police were too zealous In their pursuit of evidence. A plea-bargain kept him from frying. Busted out of Stonehurst? Killed a guard? Yeah, he and his cousin crossed into Wyoming Ditched their truck and had a car waiting. If he's in Wyoming, why are you here? We think he'll head for Mexico But he has friends here So we're setting up a half-dozen stakeouts. We'll handle the important ones But since we're a little short on help Your men will take the others. Of course. Who we watching? He has an old girlfriend here. He hasn't seen her for a year and a half. Her name is Maria McGuire. You'll be watching her house. The second precinct takes the restaurant where she works. Here are the keys to the apartment we rented Across the street from where she lives. We have to move on this one quick. I know it's short notice But this is real bad people we're after. Do we get a bug? Hopefully, within 24 hours. Ah, just one other thing... if you spot Montgomery, report it. Nothing more. Remember, this is an FBI operation. Wait a second. Excuse me, captain. There's something a little ripe here. Let me ask a question. What you're asking is, you'd like us to sit on our butts On some low-priority shit detail On the off-chance that we'll run across some "bad people" And then what are we supposed to do? We're supposed to give you a jingle So you can make the arrest and get the keys to the city? Excuse me, captain, I'm sorry. I don't like to sound negative But this is bullshit. I'm a cop. You understand me? I'm not a security guard. I see some bad people I'm going to be a little too busy to make a phone call. I hope the attitude Doesn't affect the performance. Would you like to see how this attitude... Are you through Mr. Lecce? We'll call. What an asshole. Definitely. Hey, hey! I don't want to hear that kind of crap. I don't want to hear that someone else heard it, got it? This is a 24-hour surveillance. Jack and Phil will take the day shift Chris and Bill the nights. Same routine as last time. Something bothering you Mr. Coldshank? No, no. Don't bullshit me. What's on your so-called mind? If it's all the same to you, sir, I'd just as soon not Be on a stakeout with them again. Hear, hear, sir. Why? Why? Yeah. Why? Chris and Bill are slobs, sir. No, no. On the last stakeout we were on with them They never once cleaned up after themselves. Look at them. Smell him. Lick my left one, buddy! You left cigar butts all over the place. Oh, please. You never changed the toilet paper. You are disgusting. You are filth. What about his dog? He let his dog piss all over the carpet. That's a goddamn lie. Come on, come on. Don't blame the dog. Phil did all the pissing. How'd you like me to piss on you? Sit down. Sit down! I think I broke my zipper. That's enough. This is not an invitation to a prom, boys. I don't give a shit if you don't like the date. You gentlemen will watch this broad Until the fat lady sings or I say different. And if you fuck this up I'll take your nuts and tie them in a knot And run them through my shredder. - Captain? - Yeah? Phil doesn't have any nuts, sir. Get out, get out. - Downwind, please. All right, that's hers. And we're there. Home sweet home. I hope the place has got some heat. Carol's okay with all this, isn't she? Bonnie will kill me if she finds out We're gonna be here for a couple weeks. * Heigh-Ho, heigh-Ho * it's off to work we go... Ugh. "Lucy! You got some explaining to do." Very attractive. I think Jason lives here. Phew-Wee. What a nightmare. Really. What the hell did we do to deserve this? We sent that stripper to the captain on his birthday. We should have sent the woman. Yeah, I think you're right. I screwed up. Hello. Hello, baby. Hi. Where are you? Right now I'm freezing my butt off, staring through a telescope At a house on Speck Road. Didn't anyone ever tell you that's against the law? No personal calls. No personal calls. Chris and I got a stakeout on the night shift. That does it. I'm crossing the captain off the Christmas list. Uh, Chris says hi. That's nice. So how long is this one supposed to take? Couple weeks. A couple of weeks? Jeffrey will be full grown next time you see him. Yeah, I hope he remembers me. I gotta go, okay? I love you. I love you, too. Be good. Bye. Bye-Bye. Pizza. We're in luck. We got every room covered, except the bathroom. Hey, you know, maybe You should call Bonnie. She'd only yell. I'm not in the mood. Well, I can call her. You want me to call? No, no, no, that's okay. I can call her. I can take care of my own love life. Thank you very much. Get away, get away. She's probably in bed with some other guy. Poor bastard. Poor bastard. So, who we watching anyway? Ah, Miss Maria Guadalupe... Guadalupe? ...McGuire. Irish-Mexican. A waitress going to night school, but not this quarter. She drives a 1980 Volkswagen. Lives alone. Nothing. Long brown hair, brown eyes. Hmm. 5'6 Too tall. For us, anyway. Too tall. Oh, and the moment we've all been waiting for... 313 pounds. 313 pounds? Let me see that! That's fully clothed. Oh, my god! She could be the house! This is disgusting! I hate this job! "They're dusting off the hot seat for me." "On the waterfront." Who said it? Lee J Cobb. The 16th president of the U.S.? I don't know. Here's a hint. Abe Lincoln. You're right. Okay, what movie, what movie? "Well, this was not a boating accident." I don't know. You're hopeless. 15th president of the United States. I don't know. Fillmore. Buchanan. Give me another one. 1980 Volkswagen, right? Right. The rock's in the sock. We got some movement, buddy. This is Guadalupe? Turn around. I think she's gone on a diet.

I better make some notes. She's walking into the kitchen. Now she's walking across the room. Where's she going? Looks to be the bedroom. What's she doing? Looks like, uh... Like what?

Sorry to disturb you. I'm from the phone company. Apparently there's a line problem in the neighbourhood. Seriously? Isn't there something wrong with your phone? Yeah, my phone's dead. I can't believe you're already here. Well, we got a lot of calls, you know. Whole neighbourhood is down. Well... you know It's really not a very good time for me. I have to be going. I understand. I understand. It would only take a couple of minutes But if it would be a lot easier We could come back next week. Ah... wait a minute. If I don't have it fixed now It'll be another couple of weeks? No... no, no. Five days, max. Five days? Come on, Maria. How can you resist him? Okay, if it doesn't take too long, come on in. Be out of your way in just a second. Bingo. There we go. Not bad for an old fart. There's one phone over there And another in the bedroom. Okeydoke. I'll be out of your way as fast as I can. Hi, sailor. She's in the bedroom Tidying up, trying to make a good impression. Oops, don't look under the bed. Okay, okay, now-- She's coming back. Okay. All checked out here. Want to show me the next one? Sure. Hi! Now a word from our sponsors... She's in the kitchen Just in case you were wondering. What's that? Now is no time to be pausing for news, Chris. What are you doing? Where are you going? Chris, she is in the house. Stop screwing around, for Christ's sake. If you blow this and we get busted... Goddamn it, Chris, come on. Stop messing around. Chris, she's... She's right there, for Christ's sake. Chris... Chris, she's coming. Chris, she's coming. She's coming! Chris, goddamn it! Jesus Christ! I really can't wait any more. I'm sorry. Problem? My brother is in a lot of trouble right now. He's down with the police At the station And there's bail I have to take care of. Something serious? Yeah, I think it is. Could you come back Tomorrow maybe, or..? I'm done. It's fixed? The problem isn't in the phone. It's on the pole. I have to check outside. Oh. Well... Thanks a lot. I'm in love, Bill. I'm leaving you. It happens to one out of every six men. I have to face up to my heterosexuality. But don't worry. You'll be well provided for. What the hell were you doing? What do you mean, what was I doing? I was putting in a bug, for crying out loud. Oh, really. Is that what that was? I don't call going through that woman's drawers putting in a goddamn bug! Oh, calm down. Don't blow a bowel. For crying out loud. I thought I saw something in her bureau That would tell us whether or not she talked to Montgomery. Yeah, she's gone. Give me the flashlight. I'm going to go back in there and check it out. Come on. No, no, no, no, no. No? No. Chris, this is the feds' party. I am not gonna get my ass canned For illegal procedure. "This is the feds' party. I'm not gonna get my ass canned for illegal procedure"? Give me the goddamn flashlight. Nothing's gonna happen to you. The worst thing they could do to you is suspend you for, what, three years. Well, that's great. I'm kidding! Jesus. The man never knows when I'm kidding. I'm only making a little joke, a little humour. What a boner. You there? You in? I'm in. Then hurry up. Car. I'm sorry, sorry. Are you kidding me? You're sorry? You're making me very nervous. I'm making you nervous? That's a hoot. Okay, I think I got something real important here. A bunch of letters here, all from Montgomery And the last one's dated about four months ago. "Dear Maria... "First you stop coming to visit me "And now you won't even answer my letters. "I understand you're lonely. "I hear you're seeing a couple of guys. "Sometimes I get so mad that I could wipe out a whole planet And enjoy myself doing it." How could she have dumped a charmer like him? All right, take this down. I think we got something to check out. He apparently has a buddy with the initials "B.C." Right here in Seattle. Seems to work on the docks. Now he's talking about some furniture. He bought it for a present... Does she still have it? Apparently got it for her birthday. It's very important to him. Holy shit! What? Get out of the house. Get out of the fuckin' house. She's right there. She's at the stairs. Are you fucking with me? No, I'm not fucking with you! Get out of the house! Come on, Chris. Are you, crazy? * At night * when you turn off all the lights * * there's no place that you can hide * * no, no * the rhythm is gonna get you * the rhythm is gonna get you What's going on in there? Where the hell are you? * The rhythm is gonna get you * tonight. * The rhythm is gonna get you * tonight. Ahhh... Jesus! Sergeant Bernie? Yeah, this is Chris Lecce. I'm fine, fine. How are you? Great. I want you to run a make on a guy named Reynaldo McGuire. Yeah, find out any priors, anything at all. Thanks. Oh, I'm just enjoying my day off. Bye. Oh, come on. There is no way, Chris! There is no way one bullet Could have done all that damage. "No way"? What does "no way" mean? One bullet came from the Grassy Knoll The other from the Texas school book depository. How naive can you be? You think the Chief Justice of the United States lied? Is that right? That Gerald Ford lied? Those bastards. What? They ate everything and left us a goddamn dog turd! Earl Warren left us a dog turd? No, Phil and Jack. Why do you care about that stuff? You were five years old when it happened. I don't know how yet, but I'm going to get those guys, man. Give me the keys to the car. I'll go to the supermarket. What do you want? How about some truth and justice? What else? Doughnuts. Why not? We're cops. Hi. Hi. The phone man, right? Right, right. How's your phone? It still works. Do you live in the neighborhood? No, no. I was in the area working. More lines down? Always. Are you satisfied with the phone system? You don't need anything else installed? Any trimline, or videophone, or anything at all? You a a phone man, aren't you? Why do you say that? You're still working on another line. Get it? Got it. Good. $16.13. Hope your phone breaks real soon. You promise to fix it If it does? I promise. Bye. Eating in between meals? "Eating in between meals?" Wait a minute. Don't go. Oh, shit. You wouldn't be headed In my direction, would you? I'm sorry. I don't know your name. Oh... uh... eh... Bill. Bill? Bill. I'm Maria. Hi. Can I make you a trade? A cup of coffee for a ride home? My bike has this stupid flat And it's getting ready to rain. Well, uh... Please? Yeah, what the hell. Good. Thank you. We'll put it in the trunk. Oh, I don't believe this! Yeah? Hi. I'm going to be a little late. No, no, take your time. I'm having a cup of coffee. Have two cups. Nothing going on here... just dull old police work. Hey, great. Tell me, how's that forklift coming? Heh-Heh-Heh... I'll be about a half hour. Where are my doughnuts, you prick? Maybe more. You really are a nice guy, aren't you? Don't say that. Why? You are. You gave me a ride home. You're unpacking my groceries. You fixed my phone. You're nice. I know, I know, I'm nice, I'm nice. I hate that. It's a curse. What? It's like "medium." I always wanted to be... bad. Oh, these go in the sack. Think bad is good? Well, yeah. I always wanted a little bad. I thought it would make my "nice" Better. Let me tell you something... Bad isn't all it's cracked up to be. Bad is bad And I think right now I'd settle for a little nice. I think. What are we talking about? Dinner. Do you like Mexican food? I made this mean camarones veracruzanos. You like spicy? I love spicy. Good. Then you're gonna want to marry me after this. Ah, Chris... for crying out loud. Oh, yeah. Aw, this is ridiculous. I'm going to kill him. I was born on the day of the dead. It's a big deal in Latino culture. They do it to make fun of death And take it seriously at the same time. So every year, as long as I can remember, someone in my family Has always given me some kind of skeleton On my birthday. And now I've got this full graveyard. Got a big family? My younger brother lives at home with my mom, except this week And I've got a ton of relatives In Veracruz. About your brother... I... I happen to know A couple of cops. I could ask around Find out what's going on. You think they'd tell you? Yeah, if they want their phones to work. Oh, that would be nice. Oh, I'm sorry... There's that word again. I kind of like your smile. Well, I must be kind of drunk. Maria, let me ask you something. What, Mr. Bill? How come you know so much about what's bad? Well... There was this man once And he was violent And crazy, and dangerous And I... I was insane. I was insane Because I was with him for a while. It's all over now. Did you love him? I was crazy I think. Where is he now? Why do you ask? Why do you think? I think I have to go. Yeah, me, too. I've got the late shift. No, no, no, leave them. I'll do them in a couple of years. Want to know what the best thing you said tonight was? What? That you liked my smile. Oh... I know, I know... I'm nice. I know. I'm not that nice. Honey, I'm home. I bumped into her at the goddamn store. What was I supposed to do? Pretend I'd never seen her before? Huh? Anyway, we're supposed to be watching the house. So I was watching the house... From the inside. Nothing. Here are your doughnuts. I didn't eat one of them, and there was a glaze on it and everything. I got you some Pringles and some Oreos. You going to get together with her again? Maybe go to..? Give me a break... She made me dinner. That was it. Nothing more? Nothing more. Okay, mister liar. Sergeant Bernie called. Says that Reynaldo McGuire was arrested On the 17th for a "G.T.A." Wouldn't just happen to be any relation, would it? Give me a break. She told me her brother was in jail. I checked it out. I thought it was a lead. A lead? Yeah, a lead. Fine. You tell me you're checking out a lead. I'm gonna believe you're... Checking out a lead. I realise this is a shit detail. Oh, boy! I mean, can we talk? Nobody's gonna care what we do here. Bottom of the barrel. But I would appreciate That you not act like a walking hard-On While we're working together. Excuse me. Succinctly put. All the money in the cash register, right now. Okay, okay, take it easy. Reach up and get me A hunting knife, would you please? Sorry, we're closed. 72... What've we got? $273. All right. That's plenty. That's all we need. All we need is gas money. It's hardly worth rubbing people out for. What? Nothing. What did I do now? Reynaldo, isn't it? Ray. I heard you got yourself into a little trouble. You a cop? You a criminal? No. This girl's father's got it in for me. He does? Why? Doesn't want me seeing his daughter. She's pretty precious, huh? Yeah. Why did you hot-wire the car? We thought it would be okay. I was stupid. It's not very pleasant being in here, is it? Why do you care?

Tell me. Son of a bitch! Christ, I am going to kill them! Oh... Cover me! Our man going into her house. What?! Gail's here. Gail, where are you? Get your goddamn hands off me, you son of a bitch! It's not our guy. Get out of my house! I never thought I'd hit a woman. Ow! Geez, ouch! Oh, for crying out loud. Every time something happens She comes over here. I'm not gonna tell you again. Anybody home? Gee, I left the door open. Bill! Who the fuck are you? I'm a friend of Maria's. I came over for dinner. What's up? I'm looking for my wife. Where did you leave her, pal? She's here. He thinks he can barge right in here. She ran out. She's hiding! Is she here? No. That's what I've been trying to tell him. I think maybe You made a mistake. Go to hell! Let's call the cops. I want him out of my house. I want you to call... Why don't I help you look for her? Hey, Gail? Gail? Ow! Oh, gee, I'm real sorry. Just relax. Calm down. There's a chair right behind you.

We'll get you some ice for the knee, and some aspirin for the head. Could we have aspirin, and ice? Yeah. We're doing okay. We're doing fine. I don't think you should talk to Gail right now Because you've been drinking And you say mean things When you've been drinking, right? Thank you. Thanks a lot. What's your drink? Little rye and coke. Rye and coke? That used to be my drink. Give me your hand. I used to get diamond splinter headaches Right between my eyes... Murderous. Ever get those things? No. No? I guess it must have been me. We're doing okay. We're doing fine. How about some coffee? Yeah, coffee's good. Yeah, we'll have coffee, we'll calm down, talk about Gail. Can we have some coffee, please? Sure. * Where do we begin?... I'm impressed. I was just in the neighbourhood. I'm beginning to like this neighbourhood more and more. I was a little worried after that phone call. Yeah, I was kind of out of it. But I guess this isn't the best time, huh? Uh-Uh. A date's a date. Look, Maria, I'm... I'm really involved... * there's nothing to fear, baby * * now that you're near me. * I've never seen anything so clearly. * Oh, boy. * This night was made for one thing only * * to come as close as we can come * * this night was made for one thing only * * it's such a change... someone nice like you. * Oh, boy.

Fuck Bill. * ...for one thing only * to come as close as we can come. * * This night was made for one thing only * * to come as close as we can come. * * Where do we begin? * You could just hold me. * Where do we begin? * You could just hold me. * Where do we begin? God! What happened? I had a bad dream. Oh. Oh. Scary monsters. Where did they get you? Here? Here. What time is it? 7:30. Jesus Christ! What's wrong? It's morning. Are you going to be late for work? Uh-Huh. Could you tell them you'll be a little late? Mm-Mm. Mm-Mm. Listen, you think you could lend me a hat? - A hat? - Yeah, a hat. I got this bad skin condition and it's very dangerous for me to go out in the sun. Like a rash? Yeah, yeah, like a rash But it's worse. Oh. Is this one of the things you don't want to tell me about? No, no, no. No, it's nothing, really. It's nothing serious. I'm not sure it's your colour. It's perfectly fine. - Much better. - Thank you. Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait... I really got you thinking now, don't I? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Could I borrow this? It's yours. What are you waving at, huh? Who you waving at? Jack... this may be him. Get on that horn, huh? Oh, right. Get on that horn. Lynn... Jack Pismo, Speck Road stakeout. We have a man running from the house. Caucasian, about five ten. Jeans, jacket, pink hat, and he's heading south. Caucasian, five ten, jeans, jacket... Pink hat? Yeah, and a shawl. He's heading south. Excuse me! My fault, my fault, sorry. No! No! Back it up! Asshole. Get away from me! Get down. Get away from me. Get down! Whoa-- Whoa! Come on, come on! Get in! Did we practice safe sex? - Hello? - Hi. It's Maria. Hi, hi. What's wrong? Did I wake you? No, no, no. It's okay. Where are you? At home. Listen to me, fella. Just because you're having a little bit of trouble Doesn't mean I'm going to let you off the hook... holy shit! I can't talk now. I have to call you back. Is it the police? Hello? Bill? We also have a videotape Of a man leaving The speck road house. We don't know if it's the man on the phone Or if he has any relationship With Montgomery. We're not taking any chances. We also found this. "Bill"? Man, that's the last fuckin' straw. You break it... Night. Hey, hey... I'm serious, man. It ends right here. Either you break it off, or get your ass reassigned 'Cause I am not going down with you! I busted my ass to make detective before 30. I'm not gonna let you fuck that up! You got that, Chris? Yeah, I got that. You used to be a hell of a cop, man. Get your shit together. Ah. Uh-Oh, bacon on the left. Bacon burgers on the left. Great. Damn it! All right... Get in the back. Use the shotgun. I'm not shooting at cops! Get in the back, man. How far Are you going to take this? Yeah! Watch this. Oh, yeah! Aah! Hang on, i'm going to jam them. You all right? No. Just hang in there. Oh, fuck. It's over, man. It's over! It's never over till it's over. Keep your head down! It's got to stop, man. Whoa. Whoa! Hope this road goes somewhere. We're never gonna get out of this! What the hell are you doing? We're blowing this pop stand. It's over. They got Montgomery? Yeah, a couple hours ago. Didn't get many details, but there was some big shootout. The car ended up In the Nasquale river And no-one came out. So, we get a pat on the back... Job well done... Next case. You know, you are one lucky son of a bitch. What are you going to do about her? Oh, man, I... I think I love her. I really do. I'd hate to think you risked it all Just because you liked her. Yeah, yeah. Now comes the hard part. Say, how do you feel about going across the street And telling her that I'm a cop, not a phone man And I've been lying to her and I've been taking pictures And looking at her through telescopes... Mm-Mm. No. I didn't think you'd like that. I always thought it would be yo that screwed up. Well, maybe I'll learn from your mistakes. Probably not. Probably not. No. Wish me luck. Good luck. The force of the water against the car is making it difficult to pull it from the river. It is not yet confirmed but it is believed That the body of escaped prisoner Richard "Stick" Montgomery is still trapped inside. The body of his cousin, Caylor Reese Was found two miles downriver. Hi. Normally, police divers Would have tried to pull Montgomery free But that has not been possible. Are you all right? I know. I know. Maybe we should talk. You're wanted by the law, aren't you? Is that what you think? I heard sirens this morning After you left. The police follow you here? I don't think I realised the size of the hole that I dug for myself. How much trouble are you in? You're not going to like me very much when I tell you this. I never should have let this happen. But I did. I want you to know Before you start hating me... And you will start hating me... That I've fallen in love with you. Don't, don't. Don't interrupt a confession. I don't work For the phone company. And my name is not Bill. It's Chris. You're a cop? I'm a detective. I'm staking out the home of an ex-Girlfriend Of an escaped federal prisoner. You've been watching me? From where? Across the street. And my phones? Maria! Listen to me! From there? Uh-Oh... Maria! What do you got there? Well... You guys are great. I hope I didn't disappoint you. Maria! Maria! Damn it. Maria, listen! Hold it a minute. Listen to me! I was doing my job, goddamn it! Whether you like it or whether I like it, it doesn't make any difference. There wasn't any fun in it. What happened between you and me was... Was not part of it. It was my mistake. Maria... I wanted to tell you. I just couldn't. Son of a bitch. You broke my heart They said you were dead. Oh... Jesus Christ. I made it. I made it! What's the matter? I made it! Maria, would you just think about it for a minute? Listen to me. Who the fuck is that? Okay? I couldn't tell you that I was... Don't! You couldn't tell her you were what? You couldn't tell her you were what? Who is this guy? You... Is this the guy? Is this the reason? You want to take a walk in the other room, pretty please? Take a fuckin' walk. Christopher... Christopher "lee-chee"? Lecce. Lee-chee. So "lee-chee," what are you doing, bothering my old lady? We had a fight. Oh, you had a fight? That's too bad. What was it about? None of your business. Watch it, pal. It is all my business. Now what was it about? She found out I was violating my parole, okay? Are you kidding me? What kind of candy-ass crime did you commit, Chris? Did you steal some old lady's handbag? What did you do? Take it easy. Take it easy. Don't tell me to take it easy. What did you do? I rob banks. You rob banks? Get me a knife, honey. What?

No, man, I don't know who you are. I don't believe you. What the hell is the matter with you? I just wanted to know What these things were stuffed with. They're made of money! She's safer than a bank, Chris. I had friends at Walla Walla. You know Cletus Ink? Nope. You don't? You know Mad Dog Ross? You g to know Mad Dog. No, I don't, but it was a big place. You don't know Cletus Ink, you don't know Mad Dog Ross? Who the hell do you know? Do you know Eddie Gant? Yeah, I did know Eddie Gant. What was he in for? He killed a cop. Hello? Yeah. Guess who this is? Yeah, that's right. Shut up for a second. I can only say That the reports of my demise Have been greatly exaggerated. Wherever we're gonna do this, we have to do this now. Uh-Huh. Yeah. I'll meet you there in 20 minutes. Pack a bag. We're taking a trip. What? What is it? There's someone out there. You! Get out the front door! Just relax, man. Get out the front door!

What the hell... Shut up Pig! Back off. How did you know I was here? How did you know I was here?! You don't want to answer me? Say good-bye to your mama. Richard, don't! He wasn't Following you. He was following me. What? Yeah. I violated my parole, remember? He's been following me For a week. You don't do your job very well. I got a car right outside. I can drive you To wherever you want to go. Cuff his hands behind him. If he gets loose You die. You may think serving time and having cops on your ass gives me a reason To trust you, but let me tell you something, pal. The last people in the world I trust are ex-cons. Let's move. So what's the deal with this guy? I mean, really. What is the deal with this guy? I don't even know who he is. Isn't love great, Chris? One minute you're a god The next minute, you're a scum-sucking pig. I'm leaving the country, baby. You're going with me. You going to Canada? Are you a travel agent? Drive, sucker. Get out. Sit down. Sit down. Hey! Shut up! Come here. I got to talk to this guy For about five minutes. Could you take a walk and come back in five minutes? What for? Just take a walk. You're gonna kill them, aren't you? I'm not going to make love to them. You expect me to go with you after you do this? What do you want me to do, let them go? Do I look stupid? If I let them go I am dead. How long do you think It's gonna take for them To pick me up if I let them go? They're going to die, not me. Why? Why? Because that guy's a cop, and that guy has been inside you. Get out of my way. No. Maria... You're not going to stop me. Maria, get out of my way. Get your fucking hands off me. Maria, get out. No! No! No, richard! Don't you ever hit me. You understand? Come on, man! We gotta get out of here. Jesus Christ. That guy's a cop! I know he's a cop. His hands are cuffed. Not him. The other one.

Go home, get plenty of rest Because when I get better I'm going to break both your legs. You're dust, Lecce. You hear me? Not only did you hit me once, but twice. This is one of the worst nights of my life. Well, I just want to know if she's gonna be okay. She's okay. Okay. Lusk thinks you got something going on with that girl. He wants an investigation.
