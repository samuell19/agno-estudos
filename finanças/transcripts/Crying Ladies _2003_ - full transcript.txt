This one's our latest. The inlay has silver in it, the reliefs are Italian, and the handles are made of cow hide. The lining is made of satin. The top is made of full glass, so you can see the whole body. It can be opened, so only half can be seen, if that is what you want. - How much is that? - It is 250,000 pesos. There is one more over here. This is the Somerset Oak. The base has a full-grain finish. This one is very sleek, very smooth. It also has the Last Supper engraved as a relief on the other side. I'll take that. - The Maryland one? - Yes. Your father would be happy. If he was still alive. - Should I prepare it now? - Yes. Miss, can I return this if it doesn't fit? I'll check first. Is this for a gift, sir? No. My father will wear it for his burial. - Wait. Where are you going? - Sir Ahkong. Where are you going? It's my son's recognition day. He's the second honor of his class. I want to hang his medal for him. - Are you done? - I'm almost done. I'll be back. - All right. Just be quick. - Thank you. Good day, my fellow citizens.

Bong, smile. Cecile. Hey, Stella. You're here. Wait a minute. Okay, one more. Smile. Get closer. Take our picture for us. Come on. Here. Just click this. You won't do anything else. Just click that. Wait. Okay. Take Stella and Bong's picture. Come here. Take a picture with him. Mom, come here. Let's take a picture! - Okay, get ready. - Okay, son, smile. Look there. It ran out of film. Let's do it next time. But wait... Let's go, Bong. All right, son. Congratulations. Okay. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, son. All right. Come here. The film ran out. Guido, Cecile. Let's go eat at Mcdonald's. We already have a reservation at a restaurant. For the three of us. Let's do it next time. She seems pitiful. Let's take her with us to the restaurant. Are you sure? She's a heavy eater. You're too much. Come on. I pity her. - Stella. - Yes? Do you want to come? Okay. Let's go. All right, let's eat. - That's your favorite, Bong. - Stella? Can we sit somewhere else for a while? I have something to say. Wait here. Let's go. Stella, do you have a copy of Bong's birth certificate? Why? He's an old student there. He won't need that to enroll next year. No. It's because... the mall where Cecile is working will be opening a branch in Cagayan De Oro. We will be moving there by May. I already landed a job there, as a security guard. Cagayan De Oro is too far. - Will you be taking Bong with you? - Of course! We wouldn't leave him with you. What if you get imprisoned again? Think about it, Stella. You just got released. - You don't even have a proper job. - I do have a job. Which one? Ahkong's business? What if no Chinese dies? Then, you won't be receiving a salary? Guido, you'll separate me from Bong? Stella. Bong was in your custody before. But you got in so much trouble. You got imprisoned. It's a good thing that Cecile is here. She stood as his mother for a year while you were gone. I wasn't just relaxing inside the prison, it was hard there. Well, sorry, but this isn't the kid's fault either. Have some shame towards Cecile. How long will you stay in Cagayan de Oro? As long as we are connected with the mall, then we'll stay there. Guido, is it okay if... Is it okay if Bong stayed with me this summer vacation? Summer vacation? That's two months. We'll be leaving in May. But you'll have Bong until he grows old. I told you that's two months. We are leaving in May. How about one month? Is that okay? Come on, Guido. How about three weeks? Three weeks? All right. Fetch him at our house tomorrow. Hey, bring his birth certificate as well. Is one month really... - Damn it, Stella! - All right, three weeks. Stella, your chicken might get cold. Let's eat. Excuse me. Can I ask something? Do you know of a crying lady for a funeral? There are no more crying ladies here since a long time ago. There were old crying ladies sitting over there before. The crying ladies. They're already dead. No, they're not. They just transferred to another area. Isn't Stella's mother a crying lady? Eva? She's already dead. Stella comes along as a crying lady sometimes. Stella was a crying lady, but isn't she a semi-retarded? It's called retired. Using a crying lady is rare these days. If you want, you can go find Stella. There, at Ahkong's store. Sir Ahkong... I would like to get an advance payment. I'll spend it on my son who will be vacationing with me. You can deduct it from my salary if possible. Stella, if I had money, I would give it to you, but I have none. This is your third time asking for an advance. You don't even have a salary to deduct it from anyway. There are no orders from us. Okay, thank you. Yes, Mom, I'm here, at Recto. I have arranged dad's coffin. His clothes are arranged too. Mom, wait. Do we really need crying ladies? Because they're telling me that crying ladies are uncommon these days. Ye, Mom, but they don't just seek payment here. All right, I'm on it. When is she coming? She should be helping me here. We're here. Come on. Stella. Weren't you a crying lady for the Chinese before? That was a long time ago. My mom was originally the one who cried. I just went along with her. And it's been almost two years since I stopped crying. Maybe you can do it again this time, for my dad. I still have a lot of work to do. They just pay me in donations anyway. Look for someone else. How about 500 pesos? You'll pay me 500 pesos? No. The wake lasts for five days, then comes the burial. I'll pay 500 pesos for each day. It starts tomorrow. All right. Do I have companions already? No, not yet. Is it okay if you find three more for me? Can I get an advanced payment? ‪Thank you. Your collar is tucked inside. I'm Wilson Chua, by the way. I'll see you at Funeral Paz tomorrow, okay? - At the Hope Chapel. - All right. Okay, thank you. - All right, Stella. We'll go now. - Okay. Show some energy. Okay. Let's do it like this. Damn it, Giselle! How will you get cast when you act like you're a dead person? Please relax. Maybe Giselle is just not in the mood. Is this her first time doing VTR? No, she's used to doing VTR. We never get past the VTR. She's wasting her beauty! Won't you do it right? Let's switch places, then. All right. Let's just do it like this. We'll just call you next time. This is because you act like you're a corpse. You know what? You can do this if you really want this. It was much more difficult back in our day. In Darna And The Giants, we had to keep repeating our takes because we were professionals. If the director says, "Okay, cry!", we will cry, even in the middle of the day. - We will give all our energy! - Wait. - Were you an actress before? - Yes! I worked with Vilma Santos, Edgar Mortiz, Charlie Delgado. What was your screen name? ‪Rhoda Rivera. Oh my! That's not scary at all. She looks ugly! Is that a person or a stump? Oh my! In the name of the Father, the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Father, forgive me for I have sinned. My sins are... I watched Live Show The Movie, I smoked marijuana, I answered back to my elders, and... I slept with the husband of my friend in mahjong. Choleng. Is that what you're telling me again? You know, I am glad that you always come here. But... those are the same sins that you confessed to me last week. This is your third time this month confessing to me. Choleng. Just like what I told you, God has forgiven you of your sins. Especially if you have not committed them again. Father... It's just... when I think about the sin I committed against my friend, I feel like it's not enough that I pray ten Our Fathers and ten Hail Marys. Choleng, if you really regret what you've done, that's already enough. But if you want to be at peace with yourself, then, one of the best ways is through charity. The more people you help, the more God will be happy towards you. But isn't that your work at the foundation? Yes, Father. They say that it's not that scary. There's a white lady inside, but she looks like a stump. It's not scary at all. Let's just eat hotdogs and try other rides. "Let's go eat hotdogs". I hope you choke. Miss Doray. Hey, Stella. Your sunglasses look great. Why are you here? If you don't have anything else to do these next few days, there's a funeral wake at Paz, then a burial. They need some crying ladies. Five days of wake, then, the burial will be on Saturday. Weren't you a veteran at this? You might want to join. Your mom and I were the experts at that. But I was the only one who made it. - The one who made it? - Made it to showbiz! I created several movies back then. Have you watched Darna And The Giants? - That was a hit back in the day! - Darna And The Giants? - I don't remember that. - Maybe you were too young back then. But it was a famous movie. - Did you play the role of Darna? - No, that was Vilma Santos! Did you know the scene where Ike Lozada and Divina Valencia attacked a village? They were the giants. We were the residents of that village. We were running to get away. Then, I acted like I tripped. But that only took one try. The director was so proud of me. That's great. But at the funeral, you'll just cry. You don't have to trip yourself. I hope so. But, you know, I haven't met anyone who needs crying ladies lately. The Chinese people prefer a simple funeral wake, a high-tech one. It must've been a special request. He looks rich. 500 pesos per day. Then, there's the burial day. That's a pretty big amount. Diyesabel paid me P500 before. But that was for a whole month. All right, I'm in. They don't appreciate my talent here. All right, Miss Doray. - Tomorrow, right? - Yes. All right. Hey, Stella. How are you? I'm good, Mister Ade. That looks like a new dead person. It came from the morgue. No one came to pick it up. At least they won't raid us. It's a funeral anyway. How's your son, Bongbong? He's with his dad. I visited him earlier. I'll fetch him tomorrow so we can spend time together. - You want a cigarette? - Yes, thank you. - Are you heading home now? - Yes. There are a lot of people inside. Tess and Randy are there. Why don't you play for a while? I'm heading home now. I'll have to cook dinner. Just for a while. You never know. You might get lucky. At least you'll have the money to take Bong to the movies. I don't have money right now. There are noodles inside. You don't have to play anymore. Just eat. Place your bets. All right, place your bets. I'll bet on three. And on six. - Just bet there. - No, I want this. The middle is mine. I'll borrow 20. This one is mine. Just eat noodles instead. As long as this one's mine. Just place your bets. That one's mine. Then it's yours. Duck egg! Duck egg! Duck egg! Damn it! Power went out again! What kind of government is this? Hey, Stella. Wait up. Hey, Khumar. Can I pay you next week instead? Is it okay? I'm running short on money. Sure. I was just about to ask you if you want to buy a karaoke? Wait here. I'll go get it. I don't even have a television. Here, only for P3,500. Khumar, I don't even have a television. - Besides, I don't have any money. - Just pay me next time. Add it to your previous debt. I don't want to carry this anymore, it's heavy. You can use this for practice. The brand is Carry-oke. You can use this to practice. Get it. What? There are no lyrics here. Son! Don't forget your bottle, so you have your own drinking water. I'll go get it for him. - Mom, what does "scapa" mean? - "Scapa"? What is that? Dad said that you got imprisoned because of "scapa". A, it's "estafa". You know, son. I have a new job now. I work as a crying lady for a burial. Just like your grandmother back then. - Do you remember that? - Here, Bong. Bong, wait for me there, okay? Cecile. - I wanted to tell you something. - What is it? If it's okay with you... can you not ruin my image to my son? Why would we do that? We are not like that, Stella. You've told him even the cause of my imprisonment. What does a kid know about estafa? I just hope that my son respects me, even just a little. Guido said that I should get Bong's birth certificate from you. Yes. I forgot to bring it with me. You can get it from my place. Let's go, son. ONLY HERE IN MY DREAMS - We will be... - Mom, the jeepney's here. All right. Come on. Here, bound to Avenida. Two persons to Quiapo. I'm bound to Sta. Cruz, not Quiapo. - Go to the other side. - What? Then we're on the wrong jeep. I thought this is going to Quiapo. We're alighting now. Mom, why did you ask if the jeep's bound to Quiapo? We were really bound to Sta. Cruz anyway. We're trying to save money. This is better, unlike what other people do. - What do they do? - Some of them do horrible things. They pretend that they fell asleep. Then, when they get past the area they paid for, suddenly, they will wake up. Oh, no! We passed my destination. I should get off now. Besides, it's hard to act asleep. Especially if you're hanging by the jeep, right, Mom? That's hard. You can give us a peace offering for the church. ‪Peace offering for the Lord ‪and the church. Let's go home, son. It's hot today. We're accepting donations for the church. - Choleng? - Stella? - Choleng! How are you? - Stella! - I'm good. - Where do you work? At the foundation. - Wait, is this your son? Is this Bong? - Yes! He's so big now. He's so handsome. When were you released from prison? Hey, come on. I was just away for a year. It's been three months since my release. Really? How is your son? He'll spend his vacation with me. His dad will bring him over to Cagayan de Oro. Why is he with his dad? Guido took him from me when I got imprisoned. His new wife and I take care of him. They don't even want to give him back to me. Wait. What do you do for a living now? I work with the foundation. I'm not allowed to go anywhere I please. I can't come home to our place. A lot of people there hate me. Especially Myrna. Of course, you slept with her husband. Be quiet! By the way, someone asked me to be a crying lady. Those who cry for them during the funeral and burial at Paz. Funeral for a Chinese man. I need one more person with me. Are you available? Five days, for 500 pesos a day. Come with me. For 500 pesos? - We'll just cry there, right? - Of course! - All right, I'll come with you! - Really, Choleng? - Yes, I'm in! - Just bring white clothes, okay? That'll be later this afternoon at Funeral Paz. The pay is pretty high and you can consider that as charity. One of the best ways is through charity. Charity? That's great! - All right. - I'll see you later, Choleng. - Let's meet at Funeral Paz. - Okay. Bye, Bong! - Bye, Stella! - Bye! Mom, the power went out. This power cut off my fun. Giselle, don't forget that the caster will call you. Take note of when and where the VTR will be held. Close the shop by the end of the day. Don't wait up for us. Mom, your makeup is so heavy. Don't fall asleep there. You might get mistaken for a corpse. You're too hard on me! It's a Chinese funeral. Rich people will be there. Almost all producers these days are Chinese. Someone may take an interest in me. My career may be revived. Hey, Giselle, can you take care of Bong for me? I'll leave him here. Your mom and I will just get to work. Okay, sure. Bong, stay here with Giselle, okay? What time will you come home, Mom? Maybe around 10:00 p.m. or 11:00 p.m. Don't wait up for me. Go to sleep early. Giselle, feed the kid, okay? - Okay, bye. - Thank you. Come here. MAY THE DECEASED BE LED TO LAND OF SUPREME BLISS Excuse me for a while. Stella. The crying ladies have arrived. They're not really Chinese. The crying ladies left are all Filipinos. What? Why? They might be unlucky omens. What do they know about that? I'll ask them. I'll introduce you to my mom. Mom. Mom, this is Stella. Stella, this is my mom. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. You can start later, when more guests have arrived. - Okay. - You can sit here in the meantime. Please excuse us. Thank you. What will we do now? We'll start later. Stella, isn't that Tony in the picture? - Tony? - Look. - What? - Damn it, that's him! Are you saying that Wilson's father is Tony? - This is bad. - He's a deceitful asshole! Hey, be quiet! They won't pay us if we're like that! Wait up. Didn't he assault someone who refused to pay him their debts? Now I know that the "Tony" in his name came from Washington. Stella, wasn't he the one who got you locked up in prison? Yes, that's him. What do we do? - Do we retreat now? - What? Wait a minute. Didn't you already ask for an advanced payment from Wilson? - Yes. - Will you give that back to him? We can't do that. If we ditch him, Wilson will come and find us. You're right. But isn't it hard to mourn for Tony? I know, but we should just endure it. Let's just think about the pay here. The money. What if Wilson finds out that you swindled his father? Then, that's when we'll ditch him. We are so unlucky. We ended up right here with my enemy. Just be quiet! Let's just endure it. He's dead. He can no longer complain. Hey, Stella. This is just a part of feng shui. My mom just wanted to ask which years you ladies were born. Choleng was born in 1973. Miss Doray, - when were you born again? - September 2. Miss Doray, the year, not the date. Is that so? Then, '55. The year 1955. - She was an actress back in the day. - Yes! Really? What was your screen name? - Rhoda Rivera. - Have you seen me before? She was famous back then. She was in Darna And The Giants. - Yes, that's the one. - She was one of the villagers. The giant stepped on me. I see. And you? What year were you born? I was born in 1968. You were born in 1968? - Really? We were born in the same year. - You're a monkey too? - A monkey? - Year of the monkey. Yes. We were both born in the year of the monkey. I'm sorry about all this. This was my father's wish. They're very traditional. That's why they wanted a Chinese funeral. Are you his only child? No. I have a sibling, but she is still in Taiwan. Actually, I have a lot of siblings. But from other mothers. My dad had a lot of women in his life before. - You're too hard on him. - No, really. He spread his seed everywhere. That's why my family's a mess. Those naughty kids over there. Do you see that woman? - The woman who looks like a prostitute. - Yes. That was my father's secretary, Becky. But she got promoted. She's now a mistress. And to ensure their inheritance, they produced several children. All those naughty kids over there, they're all his children. Miss Doray. How does one cry? You're not really fit to be an actress. Well, I'm not really an actress. Back when we shot Darna And The Giants, did you see me there? - No. - Back then, in Darna And The Giants, even if it wasn't your role, you had to undergo a workshop. It's all about the method and your presence. - Method and presence? - Yes. - What is that? I don't understand. - It only means that your method should have its presence during the shoot. You got that? For example, if your role is a person who is being chased by a giant, you should think about what a person being chased by a giant feels like. I have never been chased by a giant before. Well, that is why you can't act. But you've experienced what it feels like to be chased by a knife before. That's not funny. You should create your own character. For example, if you're being chased, you won't just run around mindlessly. You should be in character. Think of something, like, I am a maiden living in the province. What? Am I rich? Am I poor? Is it the same with crying? Should I think about whether I have a boyfriend or not? Am I rich? Or am I poor? Where do I live? What are my hobbies? Then, when I thought about all of that, - I can now cry? - I should cry first. You know what? If I only think about what Tony did to me, I already feel like crying out of anger. Okay, let's do this. Let's start crying. We were asked to cry now. Let's all concentrate now. We should use our own methods. All right. Well, this is a miracle. I'm not the one who's chasing you. You're now the one visiting. I've been waiting here for a long time. Stella, I need a copy of Bong's birth certificate. I'll give it to you after three weeks, when you're about to take him home. I haven't searched these boxes in here yet. Well, that's the problem. I have to take Bong home by April 4. What? Wait. We agreed that he'll stay here for three weeks. Guido, I begged you. It's only for three weeks. Damn it, Stella. You're so difficult to talk to. If you want, you can talk to Cecile's boss. I wouldn't come back here just to fetch Bong. We should go there together. Guido, we agreed on three weeks. You're lucky that Cecile even agreed to let Bong spend his vacation here. - Bong is still my son! - Then, what about me? ‪Isn't he my son too? Come on, Stella. Our parenting method is so much better than when he was here with you. My God, Stella. Think about it. We are also transferring to Cagayan de Oro for Bong's sake. What do you want to happen to him? To rot in here? Fine, I'll go now. I'll fetch him next week, okay? Hey, don't forget about his birth certificate. We agreed on three weeks. You really are a liar. You weren't even there. You're bugged by your conscience because you're a flirt. I'm not a flirt. We've been together for a long time and you still say that? Shut up! I know that man is your type! He's not my type. You're the only one I like! I don't believe you! Shut up! - Damn it. - This is getting hard for me. - Please have mercy on me. - You're a liar! Mom, please fan me some air. You know that! Okay, son. Fan me, please. Like this? That's all crumpled. No, son. Fold it here. Like this. - The paper is too hard. - No, if you fold it the right way, the paper won't feel as hard. Like this. ...to sing the Alaska full cream powder milk jingle and win 1,000 pesos, dial 635-1213. Dial 635-1213... Wait here, son. - Giselle, I'll just borrow your telephone. - Sure. Nothing can defeat the taste... ...the nutrients and taste Nothing can defeat it Nothing compares to Alaska Just go to our station and... Thank you! Bye! See? That's 1,000 pesos. I'll pay you back next time. Here's my payment. Bound to Tayuman. Thank you. Here's my payment. Here's my payment. Bound to Forbes. I won't pass by Forbes. This is bound to Sta. Cruz. What? I boarded the wrong jeepney! We'll alight now. What do you mean you're getting off? Pay up! We've come a long way since you boarded. I just made a mistake. We're getting off now. You should still pay your fare. Hey! Pay up! Where are you going? - It was just a mistake! - What mistake! I've heard that before! Pay your fare! Sly! You animal! I'll get back to you someday! Mom, look! It's a Happy Meal! - Do you want one? Go on and pick one. - I want this one. - All right. - Wait, no. That one and that! You want all of them, son? Can I get you the other toys next week? Next week? But we'll be leaving next week, right? You're right. Okay, let's get all of them. Can I buy those toys? Ma'am, they're for free, as long as you buy a Happy Meal. You can choose between a burger, McSpaghetti, or chicken. Is that so? Okay, thank you. Come on, son. Okay, give me all those toys. - All of them? - Yes. You can play with your toys later. Let's finish our food first. This is delicious. - How do you play with this? - That one needs water in it. Okay, we'll fill it later. Eat your food first. - Let's eat some siopao. - Okay, let's go. I'm hungry. They said that the monks will arrive this afternoon. What afternoon? It's already six in the evening. - They said they'll be here this afternoon. - What afternoon? It's already six o'clock. Mom, I called them and they said that they'll be here this afternoon. The temple is just nearby. Why aren't they here yet? Maybe they got caught in traffic. How would they get stuck in traffic? The temple is just nearby. Did you really call them? What now? Are you saying I'm just making things up? Why don't you believe me? They said they'll be here. Is it my fault that they're not? Hey, I know you. You have a grudge against your father. When I say I called them, I really called them. Hey! The two of you are so naughty! That's because you really don't care! Give your deceased father some respect. Becky, scold your kids. Stop that, Samantha and Erica! Damn it. My sunglasses are missing. This is Stella. I just wanted to check up on Bong. Thank you. Bong, my son. How are you? Have you eaten? Really? What did you eat? Hey, that's delicious. Don't watch too much television, okay? Yes, I'll come home soon. All right. Bye. I love you, son. I'm sorry about what happened earlier. I got frustrated. My mom nags me too much. Are those your siblings? Yes, from another mother. But my youngest sister will be arriving later from the airport. Is Choleng your sister? No, she's just a friend. How about your husband? Why aren't you two together? No, I don't have a husband. - But you do have a son? - Yes, one kid. Here. Look. - Handsome, right? - How old is he? Eight. Almost nine years old. He was the second honor of his class. He's smart. He got it from me. Really? Second honors? Me too. I was the second honor of my class back then. But that was was a long time ago. Of course, you're old now. Your son is great. Aren't you going to shave your beard? I can't. I'm not allowed to shave it while there's a funeral. Mom. Grace is here. This was my father's second heart attack. That Sunday morning, my mom was waking him up. But he wasn't waking up. My mom thought he was just asleep. Then, they called an ambulance. The doctor said... it was a heart attack. After that... he was gone. This was my father's second heart attack. That Sunday morning, my mom was waking him up. But he wasn't waking up. My mom thought he was just asleep. Then, they called an ambulance. The doctor said it was a heart attack. After that, he was gone. This was my father's second heart attack. That Sunday morning, my mom was waking him up. But he wasn't waking up. My mom thought he was just asleep. They called an ambulance. The doctor said it was a heart attack. This was my father's second heart attack. That Sunday morning, my mom was waking him up. But... he wasn't waking up. Then... they called an ambulance. The doctor said it was a heart attack. This was my father's second... Mom, can we just record my voice? I keep on repeating myself like a broken record. What happened after? I hope there are still jeepneys at this hour. - I'll get a ride around there. - Where are you headed? There, at the foundation. All right. Bye, Stella and Doray. That's unfortunate. I was about to pay the fare for you. - Choleng. - Ipe. What are you doing here? Can we talk? Ipe, we shouldn't see each other anymore. There's a superstition that you can't go straight back home from a funeral. Ipe, what we are doing is wrong. You have a wife. Your wife is my friend. This is a sin, Ipe. Let's stop this. Ipe, stop. Don't. Stop this. We shouldn't be doing this. Stop. Don't! Don't go there! You're tickling me! Come here. I had a hard time crying. We're running out of ointment. Giselle! - Mom, this is... - I'm Jorge. This is Jorge. Where is Bong? I let him sleep in the room since there are a lot of mosquitoes here. - And there's a snake as well. - I'll go get him. Hey, sorry about that. Let's continue this tomorrow. - Miss Doray. - Yes? - Bong and I will be heading home. - Sure. - Thank you. Let's go. - All right. We'll head out now. Thank you. - All right. - Okay. Sorry about my mom. She just lacks attention since she's no longer famous. Giselle. Cook some eggs for me. You're a liar. You weren't even there. You're bugged by your conscience because you're a flirt. But when you look at Nanny, do you hear anything from me? Mom, I haven't prayed yet. Hey, she's not my type! Son, let's just pray tomorrow. Aunt Cecile said that I might be disturbed by scary things if I don't. Three Our Fathers would be enough. Okay, go pray. Bong, let's go to sleep. Quick. Mom, are the neighbors still fighting? Father, forgive me for I have sinned. Choleng? Like this, son. No, after you cut it, you'll fold it here. Like this. Then, it will come out pretty. Bong, when are you leaving with your dad? On April 4. Is everything ready for your school there? Aunt Cecile said that everything's ready. We are only waiting for my birth certificate. I don't want to go there. Am I not allowed to stay here with you? You can't, son. I can't find a job with a good salary yet. It will get tough for both of us. - In Ahkong's factory. - I have a really low salary there. How about being a crying lady at Paz? That only occurs once in a while. It's just based on a special request. It's just a sideline. Crying ladies are uncommon these days because it's rare for people to hire them. Why do Chinese people even hire crying ladies? Can't they cry on their own? It's a part of their tradition. Elderly people believe that when a rich person dies who was known to be kind and helpful, many people will mourn over him. When the Gods see that a lot of people grieve and mourn over your passing, that means that it will be easier for you to get into Heaven. I feel like I don't want to transfer to Cagayan de Oro. You wouldn't want to be here either. Don't worry, son, you'll get used to it there soon enough. Anne Rodriguez, Mabel Hernandez. - That's us. - Come in. - Mom, do it quickly. I'm getting bored. - Okay, this will be over soon. Jovie Bacus. Is that you? Come on in. This takes too long. We're the only ones left. You're right. They're going to Japan. We're going to Japan today? Then, why aren't we at the airport? No, son, I will apply first. When I get accepted, that's when I'll go to Japan. Why? Do they need a crying lady in Japan? Not as a crying lady, as a singer. I see. That's why we bought a karaoke, so you can practice your singing. Yes, something like that. - Stella Mate. - That's me. Let's go. Come in. Mom, sit on the other side. I don't have a playmate. Here we go. Can you handle me? I'm heavier than you. Be careful. Who hasn't arrived yet? A lot of people. Mom? Who is that? I don't know. Must be your father's friend. Go talk to her. Are you a friend of my father? I'm Wilson, his eldest child. How are you? You're so big now. You know... your father was a kind teacher and a great friend. He spent... almost 22 years teaching in UE, right? UE? Yes, UE. But my father did not teach in UE. He taught classes in UE, I'm sure of that. I taught there as well. Ma'am, my father wasn't a teacher. Karding wasn't a teacher? My father's name is Tony. Tony Chua, not Karding. Is this the Faith Chapel? This is Hope Chapel. Faith Chapel is on the other side. That's why I don't know anyone here. Sorry about that. - Condolences to you. - It's okay. Let's go. Excuse me for a while. Excuse me. Can I ask you something? Yes, sure. Aren't you Rhoda Rivera? That actress back in the days. Yes, I am Rhoda Rivera. If you don't mind, I'm a big fan of your movies. Especially Darna And The Giants. Really? Listen to me. You got stepped on... You were with the villagers running away. You even got stepped on by a giant. - Yes, that's me! - That's you! I'm so happy to see her in person. You're so pretty in person. Stella. Tony is looking at you with a death stare. I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm even mourning for him. You might get unlucky. Hey, did you know? Carmen's cousin won a free car in Money Or Hat. - Money Or Hat? The television program? - Yes. That's what you call lucky. But what from what I heard, he got really arrogant. You still believe that Money Or Hat program. Are you done? But it's really easy to enter that program. If you become a finalist, they almost give you all the answers. Especially if you can see the look on their faces, they're already smiling. But what is tough there... is they will make you look like a fool. You have to wear all kinds of things - just so you can enter. - That's what I'm trying to say. That's why I would never enter those kinds of programs. They'll make you look like a fool, but what if you lose? Is it my turn? All right! I win! You won again? That hurts! - You'll spill that on me. - I'm sorry. - This kid always... - What is that? Vicks ointment. What is that for? So I can cry easily. It's getting hard for me to cry. Is that so? Then, you don't really cry for real? Your tears before were not real? Come on, Choleng. Why would I mourn over someone I'm not even related to? That's cheating. You know, you can choose. I can either put ointment on your eyes or I can pluck out the hair inside your nose. You'll cry from pain. Hey, that's painful. And besides, that will sting. I'll just rub it on the sides. Watch me. Like this. Here. Just on the sides. On the sides. I can't see. On the sides. Like that. Miss Doray? - It hurts! - Stella! - Wet it. - Use this. - It's getting cold. - Use this hot water. What? Hot water? Do you want me to go blind? She'll get burnt by that. It's your fault! Hey, she's really crying! It really hurts! You put too much. Miss Doray, why did you do it? Son. Bong. Bong, wake up. Son, get up. We're heading out. Where are we going, Mom? We're joining Money Or Hat. Come on. We're going to be late. You can win 35,000 pesos. - Money... - Or Hat! This is already 35,000. - Still hat. - Hat? Wait up, Stella. Think about this carefully because this is serious. Here, do you see this? This is my final offer, Stella. 50,000 pesos! Money Or Hat? I'm jumbling my words already. Still hat. Hold this. Savor it. Now, how does it feel that you're holding 50,000 pesos? - What? - Go, Stella. Try to smell it. Smell it. 50,000 pesos! Money or hat? - Still hat. - What? Stella, that's 50,000 pesos. The gate is open. They're letting us in. - What? - Yes, Stella. The gate is open. They're letting us in. Miss, the gate is open. The gate is open. They're letting us in. We've been here for a long time. We're full inside. Just come back tomorrow morning. What? We can't do anything about it. It's already full inside. You won't be able to fit inside. It'll just be crowded. Just come early tomorrow. Maybe you can let the two of us in. I can't do that. Just come back tomorrow. I'm sorry, but just come back tomorrow. Go sit. Bless you. There are two now. The house is burning! - Where is Bong? - There! You can't enter. My son is in there! If your son is in there, we'll find him. My God, my son might be inside. It's dangerous now. We're bombing it with water. My God, Bong. Mom! - Mom! - Bong? Son! My God, the fire is so scary. What if you get stuck inside? Especially if you are a kid, you won't be able to escape from there. And these days, a lot of kids are left on their own inside their house with no adult supervision - That's true! - since they're all working. Can anyone escape from that? Hey, Khumar. This is a pitiful situation, Stella. Here, Stella. This is just my donation to you. Here. I don't have any means to pay you back. No, it's okay, that's my donation to you to help you out. Thank you. What about my debts? Those are still your debts to me, but this one's a donation. Thank you so much, Khumar. - You're welcome. Take care. - You too. Wilson. - Wilson. - What? Come by our house. Get all of your father's belongings that we will burn tomorrow at the burial. Where are they stored? It's all prepared inside the cabinet. Get all of it. Okay, I'll come home later. Our neighbors, they're under the... - They don't want to go anywhere else. - I don't even know what to do. Of course, the child doesn't even know what's happening. - I'll jump on that woman. - What are you all doing? I'm paying you to cry, not to laugh. I'm offering it to you at a low price. That's the original Oakley brand. For 1,000 pesos? That's expensive. You know what? If you wear that while you're driving, you won't have to come up to the ladies, the ladies will come after you. That's the original Oakley brand. Ladies are turned off by fake brands. Where did you even get this? My cousin sold it to me for 2,000 pesos. I thought you'd be able to use it more when you drive. Are you buying it? All right. For 1,000 pesos, okay? - I'll go get some ladies. - Yes, you look handsome. It suits you. Okay, thank you. Can you light mine? Nanny? Who's there? It's Wilson. - Wilson? - Yes. Please open the door. Wilson? My God, Wilson, you're getting thin. It's been a long time since you came here. Well, you know that my father is angry at me. Maybe you're the one who is angry at him? Your father loves you very much. You are his only son. Only son with my mom. Can you hand over the pork chop? What are you saying? Even with... What was his mistress's name? - Bicky? - It's Becky. That's the one. Becky. And besides, you're his eldest son, Wilson. - Honey, let's go. - Yes. Wait a second. We'll take a shortcut here. Good morning, Chief. What's up? You took a left turn here. This is a one-way road. I didn't see the sign. I didn't see you as well. There's a sign there that says "one way". - I'm sorry, boss. - Let me see your license. Here. I'm sorry about this. - Please let me through this once. - Should I give you a ticket now? This will just cost you one week seminar and a 700 pesos fine at the municipal. Maybe we can just talk this out, Chief. Talk? How much are we talking about? - I only have 100 pesos inside my wallet. - Wow, 100 pesos. That was the price from a long time ago, man. I'll give you a ticket now. I really have no money with me right now. How about your sunglasses? Is that cool? Yes, it is cool. Why? Give me your 100 pesos, then give me your sunglasses too. Come on, Chief. - Okay, I'll give you your ticket now. - Don't. All right, let's do it this way. I'll give you my sunglasses, and then I'll refer you to a job. You can escort me. You'll earn more from that. - Give me that. - Don't take my 100 pesos. - Give that to me. - I'm sorry, Chief. Thank you. Drive safely. - Take a left turn over there. Take care. - All right. Call Nanny Yena and tell her to prepare our food so we can eat by the time we get home. Sir Chua. This sergeant will act as our escort. Escort? I thought you might want an escort on our way to the cemetery. No need. - Thank you. - My services are cheap. - It will only cost you 2,000 pesos. - For 2,000 pesos? - I have to pay you? - It's up to you, sir. You might get stuck in traffic. There are a lot of troublemakers out there. It would be better if you have your own escort. All right. Sir Chua. We know a shortcut we can take to the cemetery, but we'd have to pass through Barangay Saint Martin. These are the captain's troops. You can pay them a small amount. - How much? - P700 would be enough. That's already a package. - Here. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. - Are there more? No more. What did he say? I don't know. He once said, if the first honor was not able to attend, I would be declared as the first honor. I told myself, "Is this Miss Universe?" Okay, please close it now. Okay, let's do it later. It's still early anyway. It's raining heavily. It's scary. The rain was this heavy when Becky gave birth. - Becky? - Yes, Becky. Your father's mistress. You know, your father did not come home for a long time when Becky got pregrant. They couldn't face me. The rain was heavy when your father called me and begged me to bring them some money to the hospital. Why? Didn't he have money? There was a rainstorm back then. The banks were closed. His office was far away and empty. Our money was in our safe back home. They had to operate on the brain of Becky's child. What did you do? Maybe I still loved your father, so I followed his orders. I drove to the hospital to deliver the money. Your father and I met at the lobby. But you know, that was the first time I've seen Tony look so helpless. He looked so thin, tired, and wasn't eating properly. Becky and I did not meet. But I don't know why I wanted to see the baby so badly. When I saw that there was a tube injected inside Samantha's head... That was the name of your father's child with Becky. I pitied them so much. I really prayed for all of them to die, including Samantha, because they cheated on me. But when I saw the baby, I felt bad. She was not aware of anything, but she almost died. She had nothing to do with what Becky and your father had done. This burial is taking so long. - That's true. - I agree, Miss Doray. Back in your day, did it really take this long? Sometimes. But sometimes, they only called us for the burial. We even fought against each other for the dead. - Really? - Maybe the crying ladies should have their own unions, so they don't fight for the dead. Did you know that Stella here tagged along with her mom back then? She was just a maiden back then. Now, she's a superstar crying lady. But back then, Miss Doray was really the Charito Solis of the crying ladies. Of course, she was still thin back then. I was the star that was not shining at all. How about you, Choleng? What do you plan on doing next? - Today, or my life in general? - Come on. Both. I think I'll go back to the foundation. They really need help over there. But what if Ipe comes over to you again? I don't know, Miss Doray. Why do I like someone who already has a wife? - Maybe because he's handsome. - Maybe he's big. No, Ipe is really kind. - He's kind. - And? - And he's big. - You silly. - Be quiet. - They'll scold us again. - What are we even talking about? - We'll get scolded again. How about you, Stella? What about Bong? When will his father take him? Next week. They will move to Cagayan de Oro. - That's too far. - Bongbong will study there. He'll be far away from me completely. Sometimes I consider not giving him back to his father. Besides, he's still my child. - That's right. - Then, why don't you do that? It's tough. I only earn a little. Doray. - Thank you. - Choleng. - Thank you. - Stella. Thank you, Wilson. Wow, Wilson! Isn't this too much money? No, this was the original agreement, Miss Doray. I don't think I can accept this, Wilson. If you don't want it, then give it to me and stop overreacting. Thank you, Wilson. Your bread is growing longer. Becky. I wanted to invite you over to our house for dad's 100th day. You can bring Samantha and Erica over. Come over. I feel bad since these kids don't have a father too now. If you ever need anything... just call me. This is good. Thank you very much. I'm sorry if I got angry at you the other day. If I ever know of someone who died, I'll recommend the three of you. To the relatives, not to the corpse. Thank you. Thank you. JIYANG TSAI CLAN Dad, let's go home. - Stella, wait up. - Yes? - Are you wearing funeral clothes? - Yes. - Did you attend a funeral? - Yes. You know, they say that people who just attended a funeral are lucky. Why don't you play for a while? You might get lucky. Thank you, but I won't be playing tonight. Aren't the Barangay officials wondering why you have a dead relative almost every month? This is just a formality. They know. So they won't catch us. Pork blood stew? Come eat first. Pork blood stew? - It's delicious. - I don't eat that. Thank you anyway. I'll go now. Duck egg! - How much for a duck egg? - Just ten pesos. That's too expensive. Is that delicious? I don't know. I'm a vegan. It's not allowed in our religion. That's cool. All right, I'll buy two. - Do you have salt? - Yes, I do. Thank you. Duck egg! Duck egg! Duck egg! Watch me. Okay, let's do it. Is this low enough? Can I get applause? Dip into the vinegar. You're it if you get caught. I'll let you handle them. They should not fight, okay? No quarreling, okay? We have plenty of servings here. You can come back here if you want more. This one's Belle. Sister Leonora cooked this. - What will you say? - Say thank you. Thank you. Here. - Hey, do you know that doctor? - Yes, she's been here before. Maybe we can set up a free clinic. - When can we prepare that? - Choleng. Look. Come here, kids. Let's eat here. Choleng. Ipe, what are you doing here again? Can we talk? Ipe, what for? Can we go outside? Come on. Ipe, stop it. What we're doing is wrong. Myrna is my friend. She's pregnant right now. I don't want this anymore. We'll just talk. Come on. It's so hot in here. Look, you're sweating already. What? Choleng. Did you bring the chamber pot upstairs? Yes, beside the cabinet. Please turn off the lights now. Mom, what time will dad fetch me? Around nine o'clock. Son, write me letters when you arrive at Cagayan de Oro, okay? Even if you write it in Visayan dialect, I can still understand it. I think, after a few weeks, you'll already learn the Visayan dialect. All your playmates will be Visayan natives. At least you'll have two mothers, right? One in Cagayan de Oro and one in Manila. I'm sure you'll enjoy it there. Our parenting method is so much better than when he was here with you. Think about it. We are also transferring to Cagayan de Oro for Bong's sake. What do you want to happen to him? To rot in here? Sometimes, I consider not giving him back to his father. Besides, he's still my child. - That's right. - Then, why don't you do that? ‪It's tough. The fire hit you hard here. Good thing your house wasn't damaged. I'm sorry if we're late. We got busy at the office. I stayed until she was done. Hey, Bong. I thought you were letting him stay with me. Is that possible? Bongbong, wake up. Come on. Come on. Wear your shoes. Are you set? Let's go. Say goodbye to your mom. Be a good kid, Bong. If I earn enough money, I'll visit you there. Someday you'll stay here with me and I'll take care of you. I love you, my son. You take care. All right, Stella. Bye, Mom. Go on. Get in. Take care, son. I love you. Bongbong. Stella, wait up. Someone called you. His name is Wilson Chua. He said you should call him back. Wilson? Really? Let me borrow your phone. Stella? This is Wilson. How are you? I'm good! And you? By the way, I met a Japanese talent agent. He's from Kenji Promotions. They're looking for Filipina talents. Most probably for employment in Japan. Maybe you want to audition. - You'll just sing and dance. - Sure! Take down this number. Give them a call. - Okay. - Then, ask for Bonny. Tell them that I referred you. Call 299-7145. Okay. Hey, Wilson, thank you! All right. Take care. Bye. Mate. Stella Mate. He's asking what your talent is. - I was a crying lady for a funeral. - What did she say? Drama. All right then. Love? Mister Gusting. Mister Gusting, I wanted to tell you something. What is it, Stella? If it's okay with you, can you tone down your lovemaking session with your wife? My house trembles because of it. There you are, love. Why aren't you answering me? Maybe you're flirting with someone. My goodness. Your wife is almost in labor. Isn't that dangerous for her? Dangerous indeed. I'm being forced to do it. It's so tough. My wife keeps on insisting it. Love, let's go. Come with me to our room. Let's go. Stella, come here. I'll show you something. - What is it? - Just come with me. What is happening? That's Miss Doray, right there! I'm not jealous. It's just obvious that you're flirting with that woman! She just talked to me! What do you want me to do? Why do you always sound angry toward me but not when you're talking to her? You always sound like you want to please her, unlike when you're with me. Why do you keep on nagging me? I told you I'm not flirting with her! You're the only one that I like. What do you mean that I'm the only one you like? You always feel like you're so suave. You flirt with everyone. I don't know what I will do with you. Please always take care of Bongbong. I pray that you always guide him. I hope that he always thinks of me. That's all, Lord. Thank you. - That's why I've been hearing stories. - It's embarrassing. Here's my payment. He's not even... - He left the kids. - Here's my payment. - Mister, here's my payment. - Yes, we're heading home. - That's my problem. - My friend knew about that. They get along as long as it's for money. He might cause drama. Mister, here's my payment, bound to Guadalupe. Yes, I will really talk to him. Damn it! Asshole! - Dude, this was your fault. - You were the one overtaking. No, dude, think about it. I was already in. - I went inside just fine. - Don't make excuses! - Mister, here's my payment. - Stop it! We're busy here! - Be quiet! - Are you blaming me? Don't push me around, dude. You're not the one feeding me. Look at this. Look at this trouble. Mister. What are you doing? Stay out of this! No! What do you want to happen? You bumped my car! Don't shout at me! All right! I'm here, at Cagayan de Oro. It's been weeks since classes in school started. I have plenty of playmates now. Like JP, Binggoy, and Judy. We played hide and seek. Bong, how are you? I've been receiving your letters, son. I keep on reading them over and over. Soon, we'll be together again. I have a permanent job now. I am now an actress. Finally, I'm able to utilize my talent in crying and acting. I am now an actress in videokes, my son. BECAUSE THE WORLD HAS BEEN TOUGH ON ME WHY AM I HOPING IN THIS KIND OF RELATIONSHIP ‪Subtitle translation by: Krizz Avena
