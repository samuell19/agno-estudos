( instrumental music playing ) MORNING, MAMA. WHOO! SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD IN HERE. MORNING, BABY. I MADE YOU SOME TOAST AND COFFEE. YOU'RE GETTING UP RATHER EARLY THIS MORNING - FOR A MEETING. - I WANTED TO GET AN EARLY START TODAY. - YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY. - NO. THEY SAY THE EARLY BIRD CATCHES THE WORM. AND IN THIS ECONOMY, I NEED ALL THE WORMS I CAN GET. ( laughs ) I KNOW. THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, YOU CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY HOME AND I'LL HAVE DINNER READY FOR YOU. OH. SEE, MAMA, THIS IS WHY I DON'T NEED A HUSBAND. 'CAUSE I'VE GOT YOU-- THE SWEETEST LADY IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. OH GIRL, GO ON AND GET OUT OF HERE. YOU ALREADY GOT A HUSBAND THAT YOU TOO SELFISH - TO WORK THINGS OUT WITH. - ( sighs ) OH MAMA. YOU OUGHTA BE KISSING HIM, NOT ON ME. WHATEVER. WHATEVER. WELL, YOU KNOW I'M TELLING THE TRUTH. SO GO ON, GET OUT OF HERE AND CALL ME LATER. ( groans ) GOODBYE, MAMA. HAVE A GOOD DAY. - OH BYE, BABY. - BYE. OH, THEY'RE CALLING ALREADY. ( loudly ) OKAY, MONICA, SHE'S GONE. YOU SURE SHE'S GONE, GRANNY? 'CAUSE YOU KNOW MOM'LL HAVE A FIT IF SHE SEES ME HERE. IT'S ALL RIGHT, BABY. SHE'S GONE TO WORK. - DID YOU SLEEP WELL? - YEAH, GRANNY, THAT WAS THE BEST SLEEP I GOT IN A LONG TIME. OH, I'M GLAD. I TOLD YOU SHE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE HERE. SHE NEVER GOES IN THAT GUEST ROOM. I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE'S GOT THIS BIG OLD HOUSE WITH ALL THESE ROOMS THAT SHE DOESN'T EVEN USE. ( scoffs ) WELL, YOU KNOW MAMA. IT AIN'T ABOUT IF YOU USE 'EM; IT'S ALL ABOUT JUST HAVING THEM TO HER. ( chuckles ) I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. I WONDER WHERE MY DAUGHTER GOT THAT FROM. - ( gate squeaks ) - HEAR THAT, GRANDMA? - ( footsteps approaching ) - I THINK MAMA'S COMING BACK IN. - I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE. - SHH SHH! HIDE IN THE CLOSET. OOH, IT'S NIPPY OUT HERE. I CAN'T BELIEVE I FORGOT MY BRIEFCASE. - HEY, MAMA. - Grandma: HEY. HEY. WHOO. WHAT YOU DOING IN HERE SMILING LIKE THAT? WELL, WHAT YOU DOING BACK SO SOON? CAN YOU BELIEVE I WALKED OUT OF HERE AND I LEFT MY BRIEFCASE SOMEWHERE? AND IT'S CHILLY OUTSIDE. I'M GOING TO THE HALL CLOSET - TO GET MY WRAP. - OH, IT'S NOT IN THAT CLOSET. IT'S IN YOUR BEDROOM CLOSET. I SAW IT WHEN I WAS PUTTING YOUR THINGS UP. - CHECK THERE. - YOU SURE? - YEAH. - OKAY, I'LL CHECK. MAMA, I DIDN'T SEE IT IN THERE. I WAS-- OH, HERE IT IS, GINA. - IT WAS IN THERE ALL ALONG. - ( sighs ) ( chuckling ) YOU WERE RIGHT. NOW THERE YOU GO AGAIN. BETTER GO ON AND GET TO WORK. - YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LATE. - WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? OH OH, NOTHING. IT'S JUST I GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO THIS MORNING AND I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE STANDING AROUND TALKING. WELL, I DON'T EITHER. I GOTTA GET TO WORK. OH, THERE'S MY BRIEFCASE. OH BOY. OKAY, BYE, MA. BYE, BABY. HAVE A GOOD DAY. WAIT A MINUTE. OKAY, MONICA, SHE'S GONE. NOW YOU BE SURE AND CALL ME ON MY CELL PHONE LATER ON TODAY AND LET ME KNOW THAT YOU'RE OKAY, ALL RIGHT? - ALL RIGHT, GRANNY. - AND YOU MAKE SURE YOU USE THE MONEY I GAVE YOU FOR FOOD AND NOT FOR NO DRUGS, MONICA. I WILL, GRANNY. I PROMISE. - OKAY. - THANKS, GRANNY, FOR EVERYTHING. - I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. - OH, AND I LOVE YOU TOO. - I LOVE YOU. - ( both chuckle ) - OKAY, BYE GRANNY. - BYE, BABY. OH, BABY, YOU'RE FORGETTING YOUR BAG. - ( screams ) - UH-HUH! MAMA, I KNEW YOU WERE ACTING STRANGE FOR A REASON. MONICA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE? GRANNY TOLD ME I COULD COME HOME, MAMA. HOME? OH, NO NO NO, YOU DESTROYED HOME WHEN YOU STARTED BORROWING THINGS AROUND HERE AND HAVING YARD SALES TO SUPPORT YOUR HABITS. REGINA, STOP YELLING AT HER. MAMA, WHAT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HEAVEN IS SHE DOING HERE?! NOW DID YOU ACTUALLY-- DID YOU REALLY TELL HER SHE COULD STAY HERE IN MY HOUSE? - IN MY HOUSE, MAMA! - WELL, I DID, ACTUALLY, - BECAUSE-- JUST UNTIL-- - UNTIL WHAT?! UNTIL WHAT?! I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU DISRESPECTED AND DISREGARDED MY POSITION ON THIS. YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. I DON'T BELIEVE EITHER ONE OF YOU. JUST THE NERVE! REGINA, I AM YOUR MOTHER, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. NOW I'M SAYING THIS AS NICELY AS I CAN: DO NOT RAISE YOUR VOICE AT ME. - NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME. - THAT'S OKAY, GRANNY. I'M GONNA GO. I FORGOT MY BAG IN THE BEDROOM. I'MA GET IT THEN I'M GONE. SORRY. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. THAT'S YOUR DAUGHTER, YOUR FLESH AND BLOOD. SHE IS HURTING AND IN NEED OF HELP, AND THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT HER? THIS IS ALL THE LOVE YOU HAVE FOR HER? MAMA, LISTEN, I AM NOT EVEN TRYING TO HEAR ALL THIS. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU INVITED HER BACK INTO MY HOUSE AGAIN! YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT HER BEING IN MY HOUSE. AND NOW I GOTTA GO AND LOOK AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING NEW MISSING. LOOK, REGINA, YOU KEEP THROWING THIS PHRASE AROUND-- "MY HOUSE." THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE IS BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANNA BE ALONE AFTER YOU AND MARCUS SPLIT. - WHAT? - HAD I KNOWN THAT THIS WOULD NOT BE OUR HOUSE, I WOULD'VE STAYED WHERE I WAS IN MY OWN HOUSE AND THEN MONICA WOULD'VE HAD A PLACE TO STAY WITH ME. OKAY, MAMA, YOU'RE RIGHT, THIS IS YOUR HOUSE TOO. AND THAT IS WHY I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HAVE HER BACK UP IN HERE! MAMA, LISTEN, YOU KNOW SHE'S GONNA TRY TO TAKE EVERYTHING THAT ISN'T NAILED DOWN. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO LOSE HERE. SHE'S LIKE A MAGICIAN. SHE JUST MAKES THINGS-- POOF-- DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR. WELL, MAMA, GUESS WHAT-- I'M TIRED OF IT. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME SHE TOOK THAT 42" TELEVISION? WALKED RIGHT UP OUT OF HERE. NOBODY NOTICED. SHE'S LIKE A HOUDINI. SHE DOES ESCAPE ACTS, BUT WITH MY STUFF! STUFF CAN BE REPLACED, REGINA! LIVES CAN'T BE REPLACED. THIS IS A LIFE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. YOUR VERY OWN DAUGHTER'S LIFE. NOW I'M NOT SAYING YOU GIVE HER FREE REIN TO COME HERE AND TAKE WHATEVER SHE PLEASES. SHE CAME TO ME ASKING FOR HELP AND I'M NOT ABOUT TO TURN MY BACK ON HER FOR STUFF-- ANYBODY'S STUFF. WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, MAMA. I'VE WORKED REALLY HARD FOR MY STUFF, AS YOU CALL IT. AND I'LL BE DOG IF I'MA LET SOMEBODY WALK UP HERE AND HAUL IT ALL AWAY. IT'S NOT GOING DOWN LIKE THAT. WELL, THAT SOMEBODY, AS YOU CALL IT, IS YOUR DAUGHTER-- YOUR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD. YOU CAN'T PUT THINGS BEFORE FAMILY AND EXPECT TO BE BLESSED. THAT'S THE SAME AS PUTTING STUFF BEFORE GOD. AND YOU GOT A LOT TO LEARN, MISSY, AND YOU GONNA LEARN IT THE HARD WAY IF YOU DON'T CHANGE. MAMA, I'M NOT PUTTING STUFF BEFORE GOD. WHEN YOU VALUE THINGS IN YOUR LIFE MORE THAN PEOPLE, THEN YES YOU ARE. "THAT THAT YOU DO UNTO THE LEAST OF MY BRETHREN, - YOU DO UNTO ME." - THERE YOU GO WITH THE BIBLE SCRIPTURE, MAMA. ANYTHING HAPPENS, YOU'VE GOT A SCRIPTURE. A LIGHT BULB BLOWS OUT AND YOU'VE GOT A SCRIPTURE FOR IT. WHAT ABOUT ME, MAMA? I AM TIRED OF PEOPLE DOING UNTO ME WHAT I DON'T WANT DONE. AND I'M TIRED OF MONICA COMING UP IN MY HOUSE, USING IT LIKE IT'S SOME KIND OF BED AND BREAKFAST, ALL TIRED AND WEARY FROM ALL THAT METH SHE'S DOING OUT ON THE STREET. AND THEN COME UP IN HERE WHEN SHE'S ALL FULL AND RESTED, THEN SHE'S GONE OFF AGAIN-- BUT NOT WITHOUT TAKING A LITTLE SOUVENIR TO REMIND HER OF HER STAY. I KNOW PEOPLE WHO TAKE TOWELS, BUT FURNITURE, MAMA? WHY CAN'T SHE BE MORE LIKE KEVIN? LOOK AT KEVIN. HE GOT DRAFTED. HE'S OUT THERE PLAYING PRO FOOTBALL. HE'S MAKING SOMETHING OF HIS LIFE. OVER THERE-- MONICA. WE SPENT ALL THAT MONEY TO PUT HER UP IN ART SCHOOL, SO SHE COULD USE HER GOD-GIVEN ABILITY. AND LOOK AT HER-- JUST WASTED ALL OUR MONEY. I SWEAR I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS. HONEY, YOU HAVE GOT TO TURN MONICA OVER TO GOD. AND THEN RELEASE ALL YOUR ANGER AND ALLOW GOD TO STEP IN AND HEAL ALL THESE WOUNDS AND FIX YOU. THAT'S ALL YOU CAN FIX. YOU CAN'T FIX HER. ONLY HER AND GOD CAN FIX HER. WELL, GOD HAD BETTER HURRY UP AND FIX ME, 'CAUSE I'M GETTING WEAK AND I'M ABOUT TO SNAP. I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE OF THIS, MAMA. I'M LEAVING NOW. LOOK, MAMA, I KNOW YOU DON'T THINK MUCH OF ME RIGHT NOW, BUT I'M GONNA MAKE YOU PROUD OF ME ONE DAY. I PROMISE YOU THAT. - ( door closes ) - DON'T YOU EVER LET HER BACK IN THIS HOUSE AGAIN. Man: HANG ON, I'M COMING. ( crying ) DADDY, I NEED HELP. - I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. - COME ON IN HERE. YOU LOOK REALLY BAD. HOW DID YOU LET YOURSELF GET LIKE THIS? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GET YOU SOME HELP, OKAY? - WE'RE GONNA CHECK YOU INTO REHAB-- - NO NO NO NO NO, DADDY. I DON'T LIKE THOSE PLACES. DON'T BRING ME THERE. MONICA, I'M NOT ASKING. OKAY, I'LL GET YOU ONE YOU'LL LIKE THIS TIME. OKAY? EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE, BABY. I KNOW. WHO IS IT? IT'S MICHELLE JENKINS. I'M REGINA'S BOSS FROM THE MAGAZINE. OH. HELLO. COME ON IN. - THANK YOU. - I'M SO GLAD TO MEET YOU FINALLY. I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOU. - OH WONDERFUL. - REGINA'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW. SHE HAD A MEETING TO GO TO THIS MORNING. OH, THAT'S RIGHT. I FORGOT ABOUT THAT. SHE'S SUPPOSED TO MEET WITH SOME OF OUR ADVERTISERS FOR THE MAGAZINE TODAY. NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT TIME SHE'S GETTING BACK. WOULD YOU LIKE FOR ME TO HAVE HER CALL YOU WHEN SHE GETS IN? WELL, JUST DO THIS: LET HER KNOW THAT I'M GONNA GO AWAY FOR A WHILE-- I'M GOING TO THE BAHAMAS FOR AT LEAST A WEEK. - OH. - SO SHE'S GONNA BE IN CHARGE OF ALL THE COMPANY DECISIONS UNTIL I GET BACK. JUST THIS WHOLE TRYING TO FIND A NEW OFFICE LOCATION AND SPACE IS JUST TOO MUCH FOR ME. I JUST NEED TO GET AWAY FOR A BIT. PLUS WHILE I'M GONE, I'M GONNA DO A LITTLE CONFERENCE SO I CAN WRITE THIS WHOLE THING OFF AS A BUSINESS TRIP. - MM-HMM. - CAN'T WASTE MONEY IN THIS ECONOMY. WELL, YOU KNOW REGINA AND YOU KNOW SHE KNOWS HOW TO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS. - ABSOLUTELY. - SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY WHILE YOU'RE AWAY RELAXING. EVERYTHING WILL BE JUST FINE WHEN YOU GET BACK. - OKAY. - I'M HOME. - OH HI, BABY. - Regina: HEY, GIRL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOU KNOW WHAT? I WAS JUST TALKING TO YOUR MOTHER AND SHARING WITH HER-- I'M GOING AWAY FOR A CONFERENCE AND I'M LEAVING EVERYTHING IN YOUR TRUSTWORTHY HANDS UNTIL I'M BACK. - SO HOW WAS THE MEETING THIS MORNING? - OH, MICHELLE, IT WENT SO WELL. I GOT A CHANCE TO SHARE SOME OF MY IDEAS ABOUT HOW THEY CAN EXPAND THEIR EXPOSURE IN THE MAGAZINE, THEN MAYBE HOW WE CAN BOOST SOME OF OUR SUBSCRIPTIONS AND GET OUR CIRCULATION UP EVEN FURTHER. YOU KNOW WE GOTTA GET THOSE AD REVENUES UP AND I THINK I'VE GOT SOME GOOD IDEAS. - THE MEETING WENT SO GOOD. - OKAY, GREAT. WELL, LISTEN, I WANT YOU TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT, BUT I HAVE GOT TO GO. I DON'T WANNA MISS A PLANE. I'M GONNA BE LATE. I'VE GOTTA GO TO THIS CONFERENCE. I'LL BE BACK. AND IN A WEEK, YOU'LL HAVE EVEN MORE TO TELL ME. - OKAY, GREAT. - OKAY? ALL RIGHT. TELL ME-- WHAT CONFERENCE ARE YOU GOING TO? - YOU NEVER MENTIONED ANYTHING BEFORE TODAY. - I KNOW. I HADN'T REALLY PLANNED ON GOING, BUT I JUST REALLY NEED TO DEAL WITH ALL THE STRESS I'VE BEEN UNDER LATELY. IT'S JUST BEEN TOO MUCH FOR ME. BETWEEN TRYING TO FIND A NEW LOCATION FOR OUR OFFICE AND THEN, OF COURSE, BREAKING UP WITH MY BOYFRIEND, I JUST REALLY NEED A MINUTE TO GET AWAY AND UNWIND. WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE. A BOYFRIEND? YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT A BOYFRIEND. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SERIOUS ABOUT ANYBODY. YOU KNOW WITH YOU THEY'RE COMING AND GOING-- YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S WHAT WITH YOU. YEAH, WELL, THIS ONE WAS SPECIAL. BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING TO DROWN MY SORROWS IN THE BAHAMAS. - ( laughs ) - AND AFTER A COUPLE OF BAHAMA MAMAS, I'M NOT GONNA BE THINKING ABOUT HIM ANYMORE AND I MIGHT EVEN FIND SOMEBODY NEW. ( Jamaican accent ) ALL RIGHT THEN. THEN GO GET YOUR THING ON THEN, GIRL. - ( laughs ) - HAVE A GOOD TIME. YOU KNOW I GOT THIS UNDER CONTROL. - JUST GO HAVE FUN. - THANK YOU. YOU SURE? ABSOLUTELY. I GOT THIS. - THANKS SO MUCH, REGINA. - I GOT THIS. GO GET YOUR GROOVE BACK, MISS STELLA. - THAT'S RIGHT, GIRL. - GO ON NOW. - THANK YOU! - HAVE FUN, MICHELLE. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT US. WE GOT THIS. - ( laughs ) - GIRL, WHY ARE YOU ENCOURAGING THAT GIRL TO GO AND DRINK? AND WHAT KIND OF SILLY ACCENT WAS THAT-- "GO ON, DO YOUR THING THEN"? ( laughs ) MAMA, COME ON. NOW MICHELLE IS A GROWN WOMAN. I'M NOT ENCOURAGING HER TO DO ANYTHING THAT SHE DOESN'T ALREADY HAVE IN HER MIND TO DO. PLUS I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW YOU TALK TO A FRIEND IN A PERSONAL SITUATION AND THEN HOW YOU TALK TO YOUR BOSS IN THE WORKPLACE. I DO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. AND I DIDN'T SAY IT LIKE THAT. THAT ACCENT THAT YOU USED? IT WASN'T THE WAY I DID IT. YOURS WAS GHETTO. WELL, SHE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HER BUSINESS. SHE DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT THE MEETING. I DON'T THINK SHE'S A VERY GOOD BUSINESSWOMAN. MAMA, COME ON, NOW. MICHELLE IS YOUNG. YOU KNOW SHE'S MORE INTERESTED IN HER LIFESTYLE THAN SHE IS HER WORKPLACE. AND PLUS SHE'S SMART. SHE'S AMBITIOUS. SHE'LL GET IT TOGETHER. SHE'LL PUT HER PRIORITIES IN PLACE WHEN IT'S TIME. WELL, SHE KNOWS THAT YOU'RE MORE BUSINESS-MINDED THAN SHE IS, SO THAT'S WHY SHE RELIES ON YOU BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT YOU WON'T STOP UNTIL YOU GET THE JOB DONE. LIKE I SAID, MAMA, SHE'S SMART-- REAL SMART. ( both laughing ) I'M GONNA GO PUT THESE UP. - WHAT YOU GONNA DO? - I'M GONNA TAKE MY SHOES OFF. THE DOGS ARE BARKING. I'M GONNA LET 'EM COOL OFF. I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU A LITTLE LATER, MAMA. I'M POOPED. WHEW! OH BOY! IT WAS A HARD DAY TODAY OUT THERE, MAMA. WHEW! - ( knocks ) - ( sighs ) JUST WHEN I WAS GETTING SOME REST. - WHO IS IT? - IT'S ME-- MARCUS. ( sighs ) WHY ARE YOU HERE, MARCUS? I'M FINE, REGINA. HOW ARE YOU? OH, STOP ALL THE FORMALITIES, MARCUS. WHAT DO YOU WANT? COME IN, SIT DOWN. - NOTHING. NOTHING. - ( sighs ) I JUST CAME BY TO GIVE YOU A PIECE OF MAIL THAT WAS DELIVERED TO MY PLACE. SO WHY IS IT COMING TO YOUR APARTMENT? MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE YOU USED TO LIVE THERE, REMEMBER? YOU STILL CAN IF YOU'D LIKE TO. I DIDN'T LEAVE YOU. YOU LEFT ME. I'M SORRY, DID YOU SAY SOMETHING? - I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION. - ( chuckles ) I SEE SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE. - WAIT A MINUTE. EXCUSE ME? - WHAT DOES IT SAY? OH, THIS IS SOME LETTER THAT-- OH, WHAT IS THIS? THIS IS ABOUT-- ( laughs ) THIS IS ABOUT THAT JOB OPPORTUNITY-- AN APPLICATION I PUT IN A WHILE AGO. SEE, BACK THEN THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY OPENINGS. NOW TODAY THEY WANT AN INTERVIEW. HUH. GO FIGURE. WELL, I DON'T NEED THIS JOB ANYWAY. I HAVE A SOLID POSITION AT THE MAGAZINE AND I AM DOING GOOD, AS I'M SURE YOU CAN SEE, MARCUS. SO THAT'S THE REASON YOU CAME OVER HERE, TO BRING ME THIS LETTER? YEAH, MAINLY. MM-HMM. UNLESS YOU'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT OUR DAUGHTER. SEE, I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE. LOOK, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I JUST GOT INTO IT WITH MAMA THIS MORNING OVER MONICA AND I DO NOT PLAN TO GET INTO IT AGAIN WITH YOU, MARCUS. - NOW JUST DROP IT, OKAY? - WELL, JUST SO YOU KNOW, REGINA, I'M CHECKING MONICA INTO REHAB... - ( chuckles ) - ...SO SHE WON'T HAVE ANY OF HER USUAL DISTRACTIONS. I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SOME LOCAL PLACES. I ALSO HAVE A FRIEND WHO OWNS A FACILITY OUT OF STATE. I FEEL MONICA REALLY NEEDS HELP AND I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW. OKAY OKAY, HERE WE GO AGAIN, MARCUS. MONEY, RIGHT? WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, MARCUS. YOU'RE GONNA FOOT THE BILL FOR THIS BECAUSE I'M NOT. I AM DONE WITH HER. SHE DOESN'T RESPECT ME. SHE DOESN'T RESPECT ANYTHING THAT I'VE WORKED FOR. AND TRUST ME-- I HAVE GIVEN HER ENOUGH ALREADY, MARCUS. SO YOU WANT TO PUT HER IN, YOU PUT HER IN. BUT YOU PAY FOR IT. NO, I'M NOT ASKING YOU FOR MONEY, REGINA. I JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT SHE IS ASKING FOR HELP. - ( chuckling ) - SHE'S STILL YOUR DAUGHTER, YOU KNOW. I WOULD THINK THIS WOULD MATTER TO YOU. OH, SHE WANTS TO DO BETTER? WELL, THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN, DOESN'T IT, MARCUS? I MEAN LET'S SEE HOW LONG THIS LITTLE VACATION LASTS THIS TIME. YOU REMEMBER THE LAST TIME WE SENT HER AWAY AND SHE GOT OUT EARLY? SHE'S LIED TO US BEFORE ABOUT WANTING TO STOP. OH PLEASE. I'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN I SEE IT. I TELL YOU-- I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT GIRL. NOW YOU WANNA THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY? YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH YOUR MONEY. BUT I GOT A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER THINGS TO DO WITH MINE, AND IT AIN'T MONICA. WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SO NEGATIVE WHEN IT COMES TO MONICA? BECAUSE I CALL IT AS I SEE IT. ALL I CAN GO BY IS EVERYTHING THAT SHE'S DONE IN THE PAST. AND UNTIL SHE PROVES OTHERWISE-- HEY. ( both sigh ) - MARCUS. - HEY, MAMA G. - OH MARCUS. - ( laughs ) TO WHAT DO WE OWE THIS VISIT? THAT'S JUST WHAT I ASKED. AND I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T SAY IT NICELY EITHER. I JUST CAME BY TO DROP REGINA SOME MAIL THAT WAS DELIVERED TO MY PLACE AND TO TELL HER THAT MONICA'S CHECKING INTO REHAB IN A DAY OR SO. I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SOME LOCAL PLACES AND I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS A FACILITY OUT OF STATE. HE SAID HE CAN GET HER IN WITHOUT PUTTING HER ON A WAITING LIST. AND, MAMA G, IT WAS MONICA'S IDEA... - OH PRAISE THE LORD. - ...TO GO IN THIS TIME. - I AM SO PROUD OF HER! - OH, THAT'S SUCH GOOD NEWS. WELL, ON THAT NOTE, I'M OUTTA HERE. MAMA, YOU CAN LET MARCUS OUT WHEN HE'S DONE TALKING. SHE'S BEEN REALLY UPSET ABOUT THIS MONICA SITUATION FOR SOME TIME NOW, AND YOU TWO SEPARATING JUST MADE THINGS WORSE. I KNOW, MAMA. I THOUGHT BY US SEPARATING IT WOULD MAKE HER WAKE UP AND WANT TO CHANGE, BUT I CAN SEE THAT IT'S NOT WORKING OUT LIKE THAT. OH, BUT IT'S WORKING. SHE'S JUST TOO STUBBORN TO ADMIT IT. WE GONNA SEE IN TIME. OH, YOU TELL MONICA TO HOLD HER HEAD HIGH. THIS IS JUST WHAT SHE NEEDS. OH OH, AND GIVE HER A KISS FROM HER GRANNY. ( chuckles ) I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL TO LET YOU KNOW HOW EVERYTHING GOES ONCE I GET HER CHECKED IN. - WE'RE GONNA CHECK OUT A PLACE TOMORROW. - OH, THAT'S GOOD. NOW YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY GRANDBABY. AND YOU CALL ME IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, AND I MEAN ANYTHING. I WILL. THANKS, MAMA. I'LL CALL YOU LATER, REGINA. ALL RIGHT? - ALL RIGHT? - WHATEVER! SOMETIMES I WONDER WHY I USED TO LOVE HER SO MUCH. OH OH, WELL, I FEEL THE SAME WAY AND I'M HER MOTHER. OH, BUT YOU KNOW WE GONNA PRAY AND GOD IS GONNA FIX THIS HERE THING. YOU GONNA WATCH AND SEE. LOOK, I TOLD REGINA SHE AIN'T GONNA FIND NOBODY AS GOOD AS YOU, AND I MEANT THAT. YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE RIGHT BY HER, MARCUS. THANKS, AND YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE BEST TO ME. ( chuckles ) - ( sighs ) - BYE NOW. OH GOOD, HE'S GONE. ( sighs ) I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE BEING SO MEAN TO MARCUS. HE'S A GOOD MAN. I WISH I HAD BEEN SO LUCKY IN THE MAN DEPARTMENT WITH YOUR FATHER. WELL, MAMA, IF YOU THINK THAT MUCH OF HIM, WHY DIDN'T YOU MARRY HIM YOURSELF? OH, I'M STARTING TO SEE WHY IT WAS SO EASY FOR MARCUS TO LET YOU GO. KEEP ON AND YOU'LL BE IN THIS HOUSE ALONE TOO. AND YOU'LL BE JUST ANOTHER MISERABLE, LONELY OLD WOMAN IN THIS WORLD IF YOU DON'T CHANGE YOUR SELFISH WAYS. * SITTING ALL ALONE IN THIS HOUSE ER' DAY * * DA DA DA DA DAH * 'CAUSE I WAS SO MEAN AND ORNERY * * I DROVE MY WHOLE FAMILY AWAY * * NOW I'M A LONELY, MISERABLE OLD WOMAN * * YES, I AM, AND, LORD, WHAT I'D DO * * IF I EVER GOT ME ANOTHER MAN. * OH! * I THINK MY MAMA HAS LOST HER MIND * * DA DA DA DA DAH. ( birds chirping ) LOOK, I REALLY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS PLACE, BUT IT'S NOT SO FAR FROM HOME, SO I FIGURED IT WOULD BE OKAY. ALL RIGHT? COME ON, LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT. - EXCUSE ME, ARE YOU MR. SILVAN? - OH, YES YES. HELLO, FOLKS, HERE, HAVE A SEAT. HAVE A SEAT. HAVE A SEAT. WELCOME WELCOME WELCOME TO SHADY REST REHAB. S.R.R. WE LIKE TO CALL IT. HERE WE TRY TO PROVIDE OUR PATIENTS WITH A COMFORTABLE, FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT, A PLACE THAT FOSTERS A CHANCE TO FIND A NEW INTERNAL HOPE AND DIRECTION FOR THEIR LIVES. SO WHAT PARTICULAR DEMONS HAVE BROUGHT YOU HERE TO SEE US TODAY? YUP, WE DO SMOKING, DRUGS, LIQUOR-- ANYTHING THAT HAS YOU ADDICTED. WE HAVE PROGRAM PACKAGES OF ALL SIZES. WE HAVE A TWO-WEEK SPECIAL QUICK REHAB PACKAGE FOR A TIGHT BUDGET. WE HAVE FROM ONE MONTH TO ONE YEAR FOR THOSE WHO FEEL THAT THEY NEED AND CAN AFFORD A LITTLE LONGER. OF COURSE, WE ALWAYS RECOMMEND THE LONGER ONES. THE LONGER YOU'RE HERE, THE MORE YOU GET, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. SO WHAT IS YOUR PARTICULAR PROBLEM? - ( screams ) - LOOK, YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THESE PILLS EVEN IF I GOTTA CRAM 'EM DOWN YOUR THROAT. WHY IS IT THE SAME THING WITH YOU EVERY DAY? YOU'D THINK AFTER SIX MONTHS, YOU'D KNOW THE DRILL BY NOW. - ORDERLY. - ( woman crying ) OKAY OKAY. I'LL TAKE 'EM. I'LL TAKE 'EM. - OKAY, I'LL TAKE 'EM. - HEY, WE-- WE JUST PLAYING. ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GET LYDIA BACK TO HER ROOM NOW. ( grunts ) SEE YOU GUYS LATER. - SO WHAT CAN I PUT YOU DOWN FOR? - ( clicks ) DAD. MONICA, I'M REALLY SORRY. I REALLY SHOULD'VE CHECKED THIS PLACE OUT FIRST. LOOK, I HAVE A FRIEND. I'VE KNOWN HER FOR YEARS. SHE HAS AN ADDICTION RECOVERY CENTER, - VERY WELL RUN AND WELL KNOWN. - ( sighs ) I KNOW SHE'LL LOOK OUT FOR YOU AND SHE'LL GIVE YOU THE BEST SHE'S GOT TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE. OKAY? IT'S FAR OUT THERE, BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE DRIVE. ALL RIGHT? COME ON, OKAY? LET'S GO. I'LL GIVE HER A CALL. OKAY, BABY? ( knocks ) - WHO IS IT? - HI, I'M SPENCER HARRIS. I'M HERE TO DROP OFF MY PORTFOLIO FOR SUBMISSION TO THE FASHION EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT. MICHELLE TOLD ME TO COME BY. I HONESTLY DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. OH, COME ON IN. ( door opens ) HEY, HOW ARE YOU? ( chuckles ) HELLO. HOW ARE YOU? - I'M GOOD, THANK YOU. - PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS WAS THE RIGHT PLACE. - YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE. - ( both laugh ) SO THIS MUST BE IMPORTANT, BECAUSE I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS MEETING. MICHELLE DIDN'T TELL ME ABOUT IT, SO-- I'M SORRY. DID I CATCH YOU AT A BAD TIME? I NEED NOT STAY LONG. I REALLY JUST WANNA DROP OFF MY PORTFOLIO. I CAN COME BACK ANOTHER TIME WHEN YOU'RE NOT BUSY. OH NO NO NO NO NO, I'M FINE. I'VE GOT SOME TIME. SO YOU HAVE A PORTFOLIO TO SHOW ME? - YES, I DO, IN FACT. - ( zipper whirrs ) SO I BASICALLY JUST BROUGHT OVER MY MOST RECENT FASHION EDITORIAL WORK FOR YOU TO SEE. WOW. HMM. WELL, THIS LOOKS VERY NICE. BUT I'VE GOTTA TELL YOU YOU LOOK A LOT MORE LIKE A MODEL... - ( laughs ) - ...THAN YOU DO A FASHION PHOTOGRAPHER. WELL, I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO MODEL ON OCCASION, BUT I'M A FASHION PHOTOGRAPHER NOW AND MUCH HAPPIER ON THAT SIDE OF THE CAMERA, LET ME TELL YOU. - MMM. - SO ANYWAY... ( clears throat ) MICHELLE WAS THINKING ABOUT HAVING ME SHOOT THE NEXT FASHION SPREAD FOR THE UPCOMING ISSUE, BUT OF COURSE I HAD TO CHECK IN WITH YOU, MAKE SURE IT IS A GO. ( chuckles ) WELL, IT LOOKS GOOD TO ME. IT LOOKS VERY GOOD. SO I TELL YOU WHAT-- MICHELLE AND I WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THIS, WE'LL GO OVER IT AND MAKE A DECISION AND GET BACK WITH YOU IN A DAY OR SO. WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MA'AM. - YOU ARE SO WELCOME. - OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? LET ME GIVE YOU MY CARD SO THAT YOU CAN CONTACT ME WHENEVER YOU LIKE. I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT YOU'LL BE CALLING ME BECAUSE, IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF, I'M QUITE GOOD AT WHAT I DO. MMM, I BET YOU ARE. - I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME? - OH, I JUST-- I WAS JUST SAYING THAT-- THAT EVERYTHING LOOKS REALLY GOOD SO FAR. - AH. - MM-HMM. SO-- YEAH, SO THAT'S-- THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO. WE'LL GO OVER THIS, I'LL TALK TO MICHELLE AND WE'LL GET BACK WITH YOU. IT WAS SO NICE TO MEET YOU, MR. HARRIS. PLEASE CALL ME SPENCER. - OKAY. SPENCER. - ( both laugh ) WHAT? IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE I CAN DO FOR YOU? YOU KNOW, MAYBE THERE IS. OKAY. WHAT? WELL, I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A MODEL FOR MY NEXT PHOTO SHOOT AND I THINK YOU WOULD BE PERFECT. I MEAN YOUR HAIR IS PERFECT. YOU HAVE THE MOST GORGEOUS EYES. HEY, ARE THOSE REAL? I THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO NOW, MR. HARRIS. I DON'T TAKE PICTURES LIKE THAT. - OH NO. - I AM SO NOT THAT GIRL, MR. HARRIS. NO, I APOLOGIZE. I THINK THERE WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING. I WAS ACTUALLY REFERRING TO THE DIAMONDS AROUND YOUR NECK. I WOULD NEVER BE SO CRUDE AS TO REFERENCE TO YOUR-- I-I-- I'M SORRY, 'CAUSE I THOUGHT YOU-- - WHAT-- YOU KNOW WHAT-- - YEAH, I-- EXACTLY. - YOU KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT. - ( both laugh ) NO, OKAY. AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING? WHY DO YOU WANNA KNOW IF THEY'RE REAL, ANYWAY? - WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA ROB ME? - WELL, IF THEY ARE, I'M SURE THEY'RE QUITE EXPENSIVE AND IF YOU AGREE TO DO THE PHOTO SHOOT, I WAS JUST GONNA TELL YOU NOT TO WEAR 'EM-- THE JEWELRY OF COURSE. THE COSTUME JEWELRY THAT WE HAVE IS EXCELLENT, BY THE WAY, AND IT PHOTOGRAPHS JUST AS WELL. I WOULD NOT WANT YOU TO LOSE THOSE PRETTY DIAMONDS. OH, I WOULDN'T WANT TO LOSE THEM EITHER. - ( both laughing ) - THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BUT I STILL DON'T WANNA ANSWER THAT QUESTION. - UNDERSTOOD. - OKAY. AND I DID NOTICE, OF COURSE, THE DIAMONDS AROUND YOUR NECK BUT NONE ON YOUR LEFT HAND. DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE UNATTACHED? WELL, IT MEANS THAT I'M SEMI-DETACHED. SEMI-DETACHED. - EXACTLY WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? - ( both laugh ) I KNOW. LET'S SEE. IT MEANS THAT I AM SEPARATED FROM MY HUSBAND AND SOON TO BE DIVORCED. BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WITH YOU EITHER, - NOT A COMPLETE STRANGER. - UNDERSTOOD. OKAY, SO LIKE I SAID, WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH THIS. I'LL THINK ABOUT THAT PHOTO SHOOT. I WILL THINK ABOUT THIS PORTFOLIO. I WILL TALK TO MICHELLE AND WE'LL GET BACK WITH YOU. OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH. WELL, I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU SOON. - YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY AND TAKE CARE. - YEAH, YOU TOO. UH, I'LL KEEP THE PORTFOLIO. OH YEAH. I'M SORRY. - I KNOW. WHERE ARE OUR BRAINS TODAY? - I DON'T KNOW. YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. - YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY TOO, SPENCER. - ( door opens ) - ( door closes ) - SPENCER. ( chuckles ) LOOKS LIKE MY LIFE IS LOOKING UP. MAMA, I AM NOT A DULL OLD WOMAN. HMM. I GOT MY GROOVE ON. SPENCER. WHAT A CUTIE. SO HOW DO YOU FEEL, HONEY? - I'M SCARED. - WHY? - WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GONNA HAPPEN? - I DON'T KNOW. DIDN'T YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT OTHER PLACE? YEAH, I GUESS I COULD KINDA FEEL YA THERE. - YEAH. - BUT EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY. I PROMISE. I HAVE GOOD PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU. - YOU'LL BE FINE. - THANKS, DADDY. SO I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER ASKED YOU THIS DIRECTLY, BUT WHY DID YOU START USING DRUGS, MONICA? I MEAN WHAT HAPPENED? YOU NEVER ASKED ME DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. ACTUALLY, YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT UNTIL NOW. YOU TRAVEL. YOU PROVIDE FOR ME. YOU TREAT ME GOOD WHEN I SEE YOU. BUT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME, DAD. AND MOM-- I'M JUST A THIEF AND A DRUGGIE-- BASICALLY, A THROWAWAY TO HER. YOU SAW WHAT SHE DID. SHE WOULDN'T EVEN TALK TO ME. SHE'S MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HER OWN STUFF AND HER HOUSE THAN HER DAUGHTER. AND IT HURTS. THAT'S WHY I TOOK HER THINGS-- TO GET BACK AT HER. LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS HARD FOR YOU, BECAUSE IT'S HARD FOR ME TO ASK YOU AGAIN, BUT WHY DID YOU START USING IN THE FIRST PLACE INSTEAD OF TALKING TO US AND TELLING US HOW YOU FELT? I JUST TOLD YOU! NEITHER OF YOU HAD TIME FOR ME, AND ALL THE WRONG PEOPLE DID. I FELT LIKE I MATTERED TO SOMEBODY. AND THEY HELPED ME-- LEAD ME TO WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW. ( crying ) AND NOBODY PAID ATTENTION WHILE IT WAS HAPPENING. YOU DIDN'T EVEN SEE ME! AND IT HURTS, OKAY? LOOK. WELL, I'M HERE FOR YOU NOW, MONICA. AND I WON'T STOP UNTIL YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU MATTER TO ME AND HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU. ( loudly ) REGINA, I'M HOME! HEY, YOU FORGOT TO PICK UP THE MAIL YESTERDAY! IT'S NOTHING BUT BILLS ANYWAY. HMM, I WONDER WHERE SHE IS. - HER CAR IS IN THE DRIVEWAY. - ( knocks on door ) - WHO IS IT? - IT'S MICHELLE, REGINA'S BOSS FROM THE MAGAZINE. I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP INTRODUCING YOURSELF LIKE THAT, HONEY. COME ON IN. REGINA'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW, BUT I THINK SHE'LL BE BACK PRETTY SOON. HER CAR IS OUTSIDE. - WAS SHE EXPECTING YOU? - NO, SHE WASN'T. I GOT IN YESTERDAY FROM MY TRIP, SO I JUST THOUGHT I'D STOP BY, CHECK ON THE MAGAZINE, SEE HOW THINGS ARE. - UH-HUH. - DON'T WANNA LOSE TOUCH ON THINGS. - UH-HUH. - WHAT I'M GONNA DO RIGHT NOW IS LEAVE HER MY NEW CELL NUMBER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO MINE. I LOST MY CELL IN THE BAHAMAS. I'VE GOT A NEW ONE AND A NEW NUMBER FOR HER, SO SHE CAN REACH ME ON MY NEW CELL. BUT WHY A NEW NUMBER? AREN'T YOU IN BUSINESS AND DON'T YOU HAVE CUSTOMERS THAT NEED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU? WELL, I FIGURED A NEW CELL, A NEW START. BESIDES, IF SOMEONE REALLY WANTS TO REACH ME, THEY CAN CALL ME AT MY OFFICE. WELL, IT'S GREAT YOU GOT IT LIKE THAT, BUT I'M GONNA GO ON A LITTLE TRIP OF MY OWN TO THE TOILET. I'VE GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING I'M GONNA LOSE. COULD YOU EXCUSE ME - FOR JUST A MINUTE? - PLEASE, GO RIGHT AHEAD. NO PROBLEM. OH, I SEE SPENCER HAS DROPPED OFF HIS PORTFOLIO. WHAT'S THIS? THIS IS A LETTER FROM SPENCER. IT'S ADDRESSED TO REGINA. HMM. "THANK YOU. HELLO, REGINA. I WANTED YOU TO KNOW I ENJOYED OUR ENCOUNTER LAST WEEK. IT WAS SHORT BUT SWEET. MY OFFER IS STILL OPEN. I THINK YOU'RE JUST WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. YOUR HAIR, YOUR EYES-- YOU'RE THE TOTAL PACKAGE. I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR FROM YOU. SPENCER HARRIS." ( chuckles ) WHOO. HEY, MICHELLE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, GIRL? I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GONNA STOP BY TODAY. - HOW WAS IT? - ( both chuckle ) I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION I OUGHTA BE ASKING YOU, RIGHT? WHY? I DIDN'T GO ANYPLACE. YOU DID. MM-HMM. WHAT IS THIS? DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU NEED TO TELL ME? WHAT IS IT? IT'S A CARD, OKAY? AND IT'S ADDRESSED TO ME. WHAT ARE YOU DOING GOING THROUGH MY PERSONAL MAIL - ON MY DESK? - READ IT, REGINA. MICHELLE, MR. HARRIS STOPPED BY HERE WHEN YOU WERE GONE. HE LEFT THE PORTFOLIO AND I SAID WHEN I HAD A CHANCE TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT, I WOULD GET WITH HIM. "GET WITH HIM"? WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU NEED TO GET WITH HIM ON? I MEAN GET WITH HIM ON MY DECISION, MICHELLE. BECAUSE YOU'RE THE COMPLETE PACKAGE, HMM? EVERYTHING HE WANTED, HUH? GIRL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU DOWN THERE IN THE BAHAMAS, BUT DON'T COME UP IN MY HOUSE TRIPPING, OKAY? WHAT ARE YOU DOING SNOOPING THROUGH MY PERSONAL THINGS ANYWAY? NOW I'M GONNA SAY THIS ONE MORE TIME. AGAIN, SPENCER STOPPED BY-- SPENCER? SO WHAT HAPPENED TO "MR. HARRIS"? ARE YOU ALL ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS NOW? YOU JUST GOT IT LIKE THAT, HUH? SO WHAT EXACTLY DID MR. HARRIS-- EXCUSE ME, SPENCER-- OFFER YOU THAT YOU NEEDED TO GET WITH HIM ON? WAIT A MINUTE, MICHELLE. I DON'T OWE YOU AN EXPLANATION FOR MY CONVERSATION WITH MR. HARRIS-- OH OH, WAIT, EXCUSE ME-- SPENCER. OH YES, YOU DO, BECAUSE THAT RIGHT THERE IS MY MAN, SEE? I DIDN'T TELL YOU, BUT NOW YOU KNOW. - OH, YOU SURE DIDN'T. YOUR MAN? - MM-HMM. WELL, AS I RECALL, YOU WERE BREAKING UP WITH SOMEBODY BEFORE YOU WENT DOWN TO THE BAHAMAS. OH, WAIT A MINUTE. WAS THAT SPENCER? YES, IT WAS AND I DID NOT BREAK UP WITH HIM. HE BROKE UP WITH ME OVER SOMETHING STUPID, SO AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, HE IS STILL MY MAN. I AM BACK HERE TO WORK THINGS OUT WITH HIM. YOU KNOW SOMETHING? I REALLY CANNOT BELIEVE THAT SOMEBODY SO INTELLIGENT WOULD SAY SOMETHING SO DUMB. SO IF HE BROKE UP WITH YOU, MICHELLE, IT MEANS IT'S OVER. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU THINK. IT'S DONE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S YOUR LITTLE PERSONAL DRAMA. JUST DON'T COME UP IN MY HOUSE PUTTING IT ON ME. - WAIT A MINUTE. - GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME, MICHELLE. - WE'RE NOT FINISHED YET. - OH YES WE ARE. OH NO WE'RE NOT. YOU'RE NOT GONNA SIT UP HERE AND CALL ME STUPID AND JUST THINK YOU'RE GONNA WALK AWAY AND GET AWAY WITH THAT. I DIDN'T CALL YOU STUPID, MICHELLE. I SAID WHAT YOU SAID WAS DUMB. GET IT RIGHT. - SAME THING. - YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE WHOLE STORY. I GUESS THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR DUMB MISUNDERSTANDINGS. OH, I KNOW EXACTLY ALL I NEED TO KNOW, MISS MY-MAN-LEFT- ME-AND-NOW-I'M-TRYING- TO-STEAL-YOURS REYNOLDS. ( chuckles ) I MEAN, YOU SAW HOW FINE HE WAS AND YOU TRIED TO GET WITH HIM BEHIND MY BACK. I CAN'T HAVE ANYBODY LIKE YOU WORKING FOR ME THAT I CAN'T TRUST. I MEAN FIRST YOU TRIED TO TAKE MY MAN, AND THEN IT'LL BE MY MAGAZINE. SO AT THIS POINT, YOUR SERVICES AS MY EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF MY MAGAZINE - ARE NO LONGER NEEDED. - WAIT A MINUTE. YOU CAN'T JUST UP AND FIRE ME FOR NO REASON, MICHELLE. I'LL SUE THOSE FAKE KNOCK-OFF GUCCIS RIGHT OFF YOUR FEET. OH NO, SWEETIE. I'M NOT DUMB OR STUPID. I'M NOT FIRING YOU. I'M DEMOTING YOU... - TO THE MAILROOM. - WHAT?! MM-HMM. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW THAT CONTRACT-- YOU'VE WORKED WITH ME FOR SUCH A LONG TIME, YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T CHECKED IT OUT. BUT YOU MIGHT WANNA GO DUST IT OFF AND READ IT. IT CLEARLY STATES THAT I, STUPID, DUMB-- WHATEVER-- MICHELLE, CAN RESERVE THE RIGHT TO ASSUME THE ROLE OF EXECUTIVE CHIEF AND EDITOR OF MY MAGAZINE AS I SO CHOOSE TO DO SO. AND CURRENTLY, I SO CHOOSE TO DO SO. SO, LOVE, YOU'RE DEMOTED. WELL, THAT'S JUST FINE, MICHELLE, BECAUSE LEMME TELL YOU THIS-- YOU CAN TAKE YOUR MAILROOM JOB, YOU CAN TAKE YOUR LOUSY MAGAZINE AND-- I WON'T SAY WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT, - BUT I TELL YOU WHAT-- I QUIT. - OH, THAT'S FINE, BUT JUST SO YOU DON'T GET YOURSELF IN A LITTLE PICKLE, THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING IN THAT CONTRACT THAT STATES THAT YOU CANNOT WORK FOR ANOTHER MAGAZINE FOR ONE FULL YEAR. SO I HOPE THAT YOU'VE GOT SOME REALLY NICE FAST-FOOD JOB IN MIND, 'CAUSE YOU'LL BE TAKING ORDERS OVER THE PHONE. OH, AND MAYBE SPENCER WILL DRIVE PAST YOUR WINDOW. WHO KNOWS? I JUST HOPE YOU DO SOMETHING WITH THAT HAIR, LOVE. I'D HATE FOR HIM TO SEE YOU LIKE THIS. IT'S A MESS. WAIT WAIT-- WHAT?! WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? NOW I GUESS YOU CAN SAY WHO IS THE DUMB AND STUPID ONE NOW, REGINA? GOTTA GO. ANYWAYS, TOODLES. HAVE A NICE LIFE, LOVE. GOD BLESS. PEACE. TELL YOUR MOM SHE'S A HOOT. HAVE A NICE LIFE. OR THEN AGAIN, MAYBE NOT. WHAT'S GOING ON OUT HERE? - WHAT ARE YOU TWO CARRYING ON ABOUT? - MAMA, I JUST QUIT MY JOB - AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO, LITERALLY. - WHAT? OH MY GOD. LORD HAVE MERCY. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? OH, THIS IS TOO MUCH DRAMA FOR ONE WEEK. WELL, HERE WE ARE AGAIN. WE SHOULD GO INSIDE. ARE YOU READY? YEAH, I GUESS. COME ON, BABY. EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

YOU KNOW, I NEVER SHOULD'VE LET YOU GET AWAY FROM ME WHEN I HAD MY CHANCE BACK AT SCHOOL. - I KNOW. - ( both laugh ) BUT I WAS SO STUPID. YOU KNOW, I ENDED UP WITH THAT KNUCKLEHEAD FROM THE FOOTBALL TEAM. HENRY JOHNSON? REALLY? HIM? - REALLY, HIM. I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW. - OH NO NO. I KNOW, I KNOW. WE GOT MARRIED RIGHT AFTER WE GRADUATED. - YES, AND HENRY KEPT BEING HENRY. - MM-HMM. MY GOODNESS. WHEN WE SPLIT, ALL I ENDED UP WITH WAS A WHOLE LOT OF DEBT. WOW. I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT. IT'S OKAY. IT IS LONG OVER AND I'VE PAID OFF ALL MY BILLS NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( giggles ) MARCUS, FORGIVE ME, 'CAUSE YOU KNOW I-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR SITUATION IS NOW, BUT I'M JUST GONNA ASK YOU. ARE YOU AVAILABLE? I MEAN CAN YOU GO OUT TO DINNER WITH ME - AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS? - WOW, ROCHELLE. ( chuckles ) OH, I'M VERY FLATTERED. ( clears throat ) AND I WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE YOU UP ON IT, BUT I'M STILL MARRIED AND IN LOVE WITH REGINA. WE ARE SEPARATED, BUT I'M TRUSTING GOD'S GONNA WORK IT OUT. - I'M SORRY. - ME TOO. HI, BABY. HEY. MMM! I'LL SEE YOU LATER, OKAY? EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE. I PROMISE. I KNOW, DADDY. THANK YOU. COME ON, MONICA. LET'S GET YOU SETTLED IN. - COME ON, BABY. - GOOD SEEING YOU, MARCUS. SO, SELF-WORTH. WHO ARE WE ALLOWING TO PUT A VALUE ON US? WHO GIVES YOU THAT SELF-WORTH? WHAT VALUE DO WE ALLOW OTHER PEOPLE-- OH, YOU MUST BE MONICA. EVERYBODY, I WOULD LIKE YOU ALL TO WELCOME MISS MONICA TO OUR LITTLE FAMILY. SHE'LL BE STARTING HERE WITH US TODAY. YOU WANNA TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF, MONICA? NO, NOT REALLY. THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL. OH! SHE BROKE YOUR FACE WORSE THAN IT'S BROKE. ( people laughing ) YOU WANNA KNOW ABOUT MY FACE? I WAS DOING COKE, LIKE MOST OF YOU IN HERE DO, AND HAD A STROKE. I WOKE UP AND MY FACE WAS LIKE THIS. SO NOW I'M HERE TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE LIKE YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE ME. People: OOH! NOW BACK TO WHAT I WAS SAYING. JUST LISTEN IN AND WHENEVER YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE, WHENEVER YOU WANNA JUMP IN WITH US, FEEL FREE. - ( softly ) OKAY. - NOW WHERE WERE WE? WE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE. WE'RE DONE FOR THE DAY. LOOK AT THE TIME, MAN. WELL, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I GUESS YOU CAN ALL GO. I'LL SEE YOU GUYS TOMORROW. MONICA. I KNOW THIS IS ALL NEW TO YOU, SO IT MAY FEEL A LITTLE WEIRD, BUT IT'S OKAY. YOU JUST NEED TO OPEN UP AND SHARE A LITTLE. IT'LL HELP YOU BRING OUT SOME THINGS AND YOU CAN GET PAST THEM. WE'VE ALL HAD TO DO IT. EVEN ME. YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH REHAB TOO? YES, I HAVE. WE COULDN'T WORK HERE IF WE DIDN'T. I MEAN HOW ELSE COULD YOU TRUST US? SO JUST GO AHEAD AND RELAX AND COME BACK. WE'LL TRY AGAIN TOMORROW. - I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE. - NOPE. ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU TOMORROW. ( jazz music playing ) ( music continues ) ( sighs ) ( beeps ) HELLO. YES, THIS IS REGINA REYNOLDS. I'M CALLING ABOUT THE APPLICATION. YES, THE JOB APPLICATION. YOU WERE-- YOU WERE ADVERTISING-- OH. OKAY. NO NO, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. MM-HMM. BYE. - ( clatters ) - HI, BABY. - HI, MOM. - HOW'S THE JOB HUNT? MAMA, IT'S BEEN FOUR MONTHS SINCE I LOST MY JOB. YOU MEAN SINCE YOU QUIT YOUR JOB. OH, MAMA, I WASN'T GONNA WORK IN THE MAILROOM. COME ON. HM-MMM. I'D RATHER SUFFER FIRST. WELL, NOW YOU'RE SUFFERING. ARE YOU HAPPY? I DON'T GET IT. I'VE DONE ALL OF THESE JOB INTERVIEWS, I'VE TAKEN ALL OF THESE CALLS, MADE ALL THESE CALLS AND I CAN'T GET ANYBODY TO HIRE ME. I CAN'T GET A JOB. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THAT WITCH BLACKLISTED ME. YES, I DO. I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST THAT WITCH. SHE'D STOOP THAT LOW FOR A MAN. HONEY, PEOPLE WILL DO SOME CRAZY THINGS WHEN THEY'RE UPSET, BUT THERE'S NO MAGIC BLACKLIST TO PUT YOU ON. YOU JUST SHOULDN'T HAVE CALLED THAT WOMAN STUPID - AND GOT WITH HER MAN. - MAMA, I DIDN'T CALL HER STUPID. I JUST SAID THAT WHAT SHE SAID WAS DUMB. AND I DIDN'T GET WITH HER MAN EITHER. I JUST TOLD HER THAT JUST TO MAKE HER JEALOUS. I'M NOT EVEN INTERESTED IN HIM. HE'S NOT EVEN MY TYPE. HE'S TOO YOUNG. AND, MAMA, REMEMBER, I AM MARRIED. WELL, I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVEN'T LOST YOUR MIND AND YOUR MORALS. NO, MAMA, I'M STILL A GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED CHURCH GIRL, BUT EVEN CHURCH FOLKS GET INTO TROUBLE SOMETIMES. THEY HAVE PROBLEMS TOO, YOU KNOW, AND WE DON'T ALWAYS HANDLE IT RIGHT. BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. WE FALL DOWN AND MESS UP SOMETIMES. YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. IT WILL ALL BE ALL RIGHT. NOW I CAN HELP YOU WITH YOUR MESSED-UP FINANCES. I TOLD YOU I HAVE A LITTLE MONEY IN THE BANK AND YOU'RE WELCOME TO ALL OF IT FOR AS LONG AS I HAVE IT. BUT YOUR MESSED-UP RELATIONSHIPS? I CAN'T DO NOTHING ABOUT THAT. THAT'S ALL ON YOU. THANKS, BUT I GOT THIS, MAMA. PLUS ALL OF THIS IS MY FAULT ANYWAY. THIS IS YOUR RETIREMENT MONEY, MAMA. I CAN'T TAKE THAT. THIS IS FOR YOU TO LIVE ON. I SHOULD BE TAKING CARE OF YOU AT THIS TIME IN YOUR LIFE, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. WELL, THERE'S NOTHING I HAVE THAT'S TOO GOOD FOR MY BABY. BUT I'M NOT A BABY ANYMORE, MAMA. - HELLO? - WELL, YOU MAY NOT BE A BABY, BUT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE MY BABY AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THE WORLD THAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT. SO WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM MOMMY, BABY? I DON'T NEED ANYTHING, MAMA. I GOT THIS. I'VE GOT THIS, OKAY? I HAVE MONEY IN MY SAVINGS ACCOUNT. I GOT THIS UNDER CONTROL, - AT LEAST FOR NOW. - ( door opens ) Regina: VANESSA, HOW DID YOU GET IN THIS HOUSE? THE DOOR, YOU LEFT IT OPEN. I COULD'VE COME IN AND KILLED ALL Y'ALL. VANESSA, WHO'D YOU COME TO SEE, ME OR YOUR SISTER? - REGINA, MOM. - OH GOOD. NOW YOU ALL TALK. I NEED A BREAK TO REST MY BRAIN. I CAN'T DEAL WITH YOU RIGHT NOW. OH, NOW MOVE. - HEY, SIS! - VANESSA, WHAT DO YOU WANT? HEY, SIS, HOW YOU DOING? I'M DOING GREAT. YOU STILL NOT WORKING, GIRL? YOU ARE EITHER LAZY OR UNEMPLOYABLE. - WHICH IS IT? - LOOK, ALL RIGHT-- A'IGHT! YOU KNOW, WE NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT IT, BUT WHAT'S UP WITH YOU AND MARCUS? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT'S UP WITH ME AND MARCUS? NOTHING'S UP WITH ME AND MARCUS. I'M HERE AND MARCUS IS WHEREVER MARCUS IS. HOW YOU GONNA LET A GOOD MAN LIKE MARCUS GET AWAY? GIRL, YOU KNOW HOW MANY LOUSY MEN YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO FIND A MARCUS? EVEN AT MY AGE, I AM STILL LOOKING FOR A GOOD MAN. YOU LET ME FOLLOW MARCUS. HE AIN'T NEVER GONNA GET AWAY. YOU CAN MARK MY WORDS ON THAT. YOU MY SISTER, BUT YOU STUPID. VANESSA, IS THIS WHAT YOU CAME HERE TO TALK ABOUT? NOPE, I CAME HERE BECAUSE I GOT A HOT DATE WITH A REALLY NICE GUY AND I NEED TO BORROW SOME CLOTHES. I KNEW IT. GO ON IN THERE AND GET SOMETHING OUT OF THE CLOSET - AND GET OUT OF MY LIFE. - WHATEVER. - BUT YOU'RE STILL STUPID. - GIRL, IF YOU WEREN'T MY SISTER, I SWEAR-- IF I WEREN'T YOUR SISTER, WHAT? SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU STILL LOVE THE WOMAN. YOU KNOW, ALEX, I NEVER REALLY STOPPED LOVING HER. I JUST HAD TO LET HER DO HER. - HUH! - AND I JUST HOPE SHE FINDS HERSELF. - HUH. - I HAD TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE HER IF SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE. SHE GOT ALL CAUGHT UP IN HER CAREER, FELT THAT SHE OUTGREW ME 'CAUSE SHE WAS MAKING MORE MONEY THAN I WAS. - MADE YOU FEEL SMALL. - YEAH, SHE LOST RESPECT FOR ME AS A HUSBAND IN THE FAMILY. AND THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO TO CHANGE HER. AND THEN-- CHECK THIS OUT-- SHE HIT ME WITH THAT "I'M A STRONG, INDEPENDENT BLACK WOMAN - AND YOU CAN'T HANDLE ME." - OH BOY. - CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? - YEAH. ALL RIGHT, WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO GO FROM THERE? I GOT THAT RECORD AT HOME. SO I JUST LET HER GO. - MMM. - BUT THE SAD PART ABOUT IT WAS THAT SHE STARTED DETACHING FROM MONICA. MAN, IT TORE THE WHOLE FAMILY APART. MAN, YOU BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS A LONG TIME. I FEEL BAD FOR YOU, MAN. NO, REALLY. REALLY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA TELL YOU JUST HOW YOU CAN GET YOUR WOMAN BACK. YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME HOW TO GET MY WIFE BACK? YUP, THAT'S RIGHT. AND YOU LISTEN UP, YOUNG BROTHER, BECAUSE I'M ABOUT TO IMPART SOME WISDOM ON YOU. - I'M ALL EARS. - SEE, THE FIRST THING YOU'VE GOT TO DO TO GET YOUR WOMAN BACK IS THAT YOU HAVE GOT-- - YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT REGINA, RIGHT? - YEAH, THE WOMAN I LOVE, - REGINA. - REGINA, OKAY. TO GET REGINA BACK YOU HAVE TO-- OH, THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK. NO, HOLD ON, BROTHER. HOLD ON, HOLD ON. I GOT THIS. I GOT-- I-I-- I'M THINKING. MAN. YOU KNOW, ON SECOND THOUGHT, BROTHER, I'M GONNA HAVE TO LET YOU HANDLE THIS BY YOURSELF. - THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. - WE TALKING ABOUT REGINA. MAN, THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO HERE. OOH, BROTHER, YOU SHOULD'VE PICKED YOU AN EASIER WOMAN. - I KNOW. - AIN'T GOT NO ANSWERS FOR THIS ONE. WHOO. MAYBE WE CAN GO ON "MAURY" OR SOMETHING. ( laughs ) NO, NOT THIS BROTHER. - ( phone rings ) - HELLO. YES, THIS IS REGINA. WHO? FROM WHERE? WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY ACCOUNT IS OVERDRAWN? NUH-UH. NO NO NO NO NO, I HAVE OVERDRAFT PROTECTION. THAT'S OVERDRAWN TOO? WELL, WHAT ABOUT MY SAVINGS ACCOUNT? OH NO, NUH-UH, THERE MUST BE SOME KIND OF MISTAKE. I-- I WILL COME DOWN THERE AND I WILL STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT RIGHT AWAY. YES, UH-HUH. BYE-BYE. GINA, LET ME HELP YOU, BABY. - HELP WHO WHAT, MAMA? - LOOK, YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED. - COULD YOU GET OUT? - OKAY, FINE. BYE! ( sighs ) I GOT THIS. I GOT THIS, MAMA. BUT-- OH. I'M JUST GONNA GO DOWN TO THE BANK AND GET THIS STUFF STRAIGHTENED OUT. OOH! WHO ARE YOU? - HI, ARE YOU MISS REGINA REYNOLDS? - YES, I AM. - AND HOW CAN I HELP YOU? - COME ON, GUYS, WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT HOUSE. - LET'S GO. COME ON. - YOU CAN'T JUST WALK IN MY HOUSE LIKE THIS! - COME ON, LET'S MOVE THIS STUFF. COME ON, Y'ALL. - MOVE MY STUFF? - YOU CAN'T MOVE MY STUFF! - WE'RE NOT JUST MOVING IT, WE'RE TAKING IT, OKAY? THIS IS A REPOSSESSION. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T PAY YOUR BILL FOR THREE MONTHS. DON'T TAKE IT PERSONAL. IT'S JUST WHAT WE DO. EXCUSE ME. GET THE COUCH. YUP, GET ALL THIS STUFF RIGHT HERE. ALL OF THIS. SEE, WHEN YOU CAME DOWN TO PAPA JOE'S FINE FURNITURE EMPORIUM, YOU SIGNED A CONTRACT. LISTEN, RIGHT HERE IT SAYS CLEARLY THAT AFTER TWO MONTHS OF NON-PAYMENT, PAPA CAN COME IN AND TAKE HIS STUFF BACK. AND PAPA WAS NICE TO YOU-- HE GAVE YOU AN EXTRA MONTH. - NO. - OH BABY. SEE, THIS IS A REPOSSESSION. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? PAPA-- HO! PAPA DON'T TAKE NO MESS. * HEY! PAPA DON'T TAKE NO MESS * - * PAPA DON'T TAKE NO MESS. * - WELL, DOES PAPA TAKE CHECKS? - 'CAUSE I COULD WRITE YOU A CHECK. - ( laughs ) NO NO. PAPA DON'T TAKE NO CHECKS! YOU KNOW PAPA AIN'T TAKING YOUR CHECK. HOW ABOUT-- CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME, PLEASE? LOOK, I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE BANK. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GO GET IN MY CAR-- - WHERE'S MY CAR? - COME ON, MAN. GET ALL THIS STUFF OUT OF HERE. - OH MY-- WHERE'S MY CAR? - COME ON, FASTER. MAMA! SOMEBODY STOLE THE CAR, MAMA! CALL THE POLICE! OH NO. Georgia: I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT A STOLEN CAR. WHAT ELSE COULD HAPPEN TO ME, OKAY? WHAT ELSE CAN HAPPEN? I LOST MY JOB, YOU HAVE TAKEN ALL OF MY FURNITURE - AND NOW MY CAR HAS BEEN STOLEN! - OH MAN. WAIT A MINUTE. WAS THAT YOUR BLUE MERCEDES PARKED OUT FRONT? - YEAH, DID-- DID YOU SEE IT? - OH, ACTUALLY I DID. IT WAS A TOW TRUCK THAT PULLED UP WITH "R.J. IMPORTS" ON THE SIDE. - ALL RIGHT. - HE JUST HOOKED IT UP AND LEFT. WAIT A MINUTE, SO R.J. IMPORTS STOLE MY CAR? NO, I DON'T THINK THEY WAS STEALING IT. I THINK THEY WAS REPOSSESSING IT! - HEY! A REPOSSESSION. - OH NO. - OH MY GOSH. ( laughs ) - MAMA! - OOH! THIS JUST AIN'T YOUR DAY. - MAMA! THEY REPOSSESSED MY CAR! - BACK UP. - WHAT AM I-- WHAT AM I GONNA DO? I GUESS R.J. DON'T TAKE NO MESS EITHER. Georgia: NEVER MIND, WE FOUND IT. - AIN'T GONNA TAKE YOUR CHECKS NEITHER. - ( crying ) HEY, BE CAREFUL. WATCH OUT THERE NOW. MA'AM, LISTEN, YOU TRY AND HAVE A NICE DAY, OKAY? MM-MM-MMM. ALL RIGHT, BE CAREFUL. DON'T MOVE IT TOO HARD. DON'T BREAK IT. - MAMA! - STEP BACK. MM-HMM. MAMA, WHAT WE GONNA DO? THEY REPOSSESSED MY CAR! OH, REGINA, WHY WON'T YOU LET ME HELP YOU? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU THINK YOU HAVE TO DO THIS ALL BY YOURSELF. LET GO OF YOUR FOOLISH PRIDE. LET ME HELP YOU. I DIDN'T WANT TO DEPEND ON ANYBODY, MAMA. I THOUGHT I COULD HANDLE ALL THIS MYSELF. I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING FROM ANYBODY. BUT THERE ARE TIMES IN ALL OUR LIVES WHEN WE HAVE TO DEPEND ON SOMEONE FOR SOME HELP. THAT'S LIFE. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH NEEDING A LITTLE HELP SOMETIMES. BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I MEAN WHY IS GOD DOING THIS TO ME? I PAY MY TITHES. I PAY MY TITHES WHEN I HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY MY TITHES. REGINA, YOU MAY NOT WANT TO HEAR THIS RIGHT NOW, BUT MAYBE GOD IS TRYING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION. SOMETIMES GOD HAS TO SLOW US DOWN AND TAKE US TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN'T MAKE IT WITHOUT HIM SO THAT WE CAN BE HUMBLED. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, MAMA? HOW AM I GOING TO LIVE? MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO TAKE AN INVENTORY IN YOUR LIFE-- NOT JUST THE MATERIALISTIC THINGS, BUT THE THINGS THAT YOU REALLY HAVE. ANYTHING THAT YOU PUT BEFORE GOD HE WILL-- HE WILL REMOVE TO GET YOU BACK TO HIM SO THAT YOU CAN BE HUMBLED. GOD CARES MORE ABOUT YOUR SOUL THAN YOUR LIFESTYLE. IT AIN'T THAT IMPORTANT TO HIM. MAYBE HE HAS A WORK FOR YOU TO DO FOR HIM OR FOR OTHER PEOPLE. YOU NEED TO PRAY AND ASK GOD WHAT HE'S TRYING TO SAY TO YOU. I DON'T FEEL LIKE PRAYING, MAMA. I DON'T FEEL LIKE TALKING TO GOD OR ANYBODY ELSE RIGHT NOW. LORD, PLEASE DON'T HURT HER. SHE'S JUST A LITTLE UPSET RIGHT NOW. SHE'LL-- SHE'LL COME TO HER SENSES IN A FEW MINUTES. LORD, YOU GOTTA HELP US THROUGH THIS. OH, I'M TRYING TO BE STRONG FOR MY DAUGHTER, SO I CAN'T LET THIS GET ME DOWN TOO. DON'T BREAK THAT. ALL RIGHT. ( crying ) WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, LOOK AT IT THIS WAY-- SINCE WE MOVED ALL THE FURNITURE, YOU CAN CLEAN UP THIS DUST. HAVE A NICE DAY. ( sighs deeply ) HEY, I NEVER INTRODUCED MYSELF. - MY NAME'S RAKWAN. - MONICA. YEAH, I KNOW. ( chuckles ) HEY, THAT'S KINDA DOPE, WHAT YOU WORKING ON THERE. - THANKS. - YEAH, YOU SEEM REALLY COOL TOO. WAY COOLER THAN ANY OF THESE OTHER LAMES IN HERE. WE SHOULD BE FRIENDS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? - I MEAN IT'S COOL. - COOL THEN. ALL RIGHT, I'LL GET AT YOU LATER THEN. OH MY. MONICA, THIS IS GREAT. THIS IS REALLY LOVELY WORK. I'M VERY IMPRESSED. MY GOODNESS. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS A GALLERY AND IS A DEALER. IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU, I'D LOVE TO CALL HIM AND MAYBE HE COULD SET SOMETHING UP, LOOK AT YOUR WORK. - IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU. - YEAH, THAT WOULD BE REALLY COOL. - I WOULD LIKE THAT A LOT. - GREAT. WELL, DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE? - I COULD EASILY MAKE MORE PIECES. - THAT'S WONDERFUL. WELL, CONSIDER IT DONE. I'LL GIVE HIM A CALL AND MAYBE WE CAN SET SOMETHING UP FOR NEXT WEEK. - THAT SOUNDS GOOD. - GREAT. GREAT. WOW. THIS IS REALLY WONDERFUL. I'M GONNA HEAD BACK TO MY OFFICE, - BUT KEEP WORKING. - OKAY. THANKS, MISS RICHARDSON. - YOU'RE WELCOME. THANK YOU. - Jack: ISN'T IT GREAT? - Rochelle: IT'S REALLY WONDERFUL. - ( squealing ) IT LOOKS GOOD. WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S GOING ON? OH MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT JUST HAPPENED! MISS RICHARDSON'S GONNA HAVE AN ART DEALER LOOK AT MY WORK. - ISN'T THAT COOL? - YEAH. YEAH, I GUESS SO. I'M-- I'M NOT REALLY INTO THAT. YOU WANNA CHECK OUT A MOVIE LATER? YEAH YEAH YEAH, THAT WOULD BE COOL... I GUESS. HOW ABOUT AFTER DINNER? YEAH OKAY. COOL. I'LL GET WITH YOU THEN AFTER DINNER. - LATER. - ALL RIGHT. - CONGRATS. - THANKS. YES! ( squeals ) Man on TV: In this time, have you ever known me to be with any white girl? - Woman: No. - Man: No. This house here-- who bought it? Let me answer that for you, Tonya. This house you live in-- I bought it, and all the furniture in it. - And now I live in a bigger one. - JUST-- JUST-- Man: Let's not even talk about the car and the monthly alimony check. You don't even remember the last time you worked. And you and your angry little crew are gonna call me a weak black man? Why? Just because I like to come back home - to a peaceful house at the end of the day... - ST-- ...instead of going back to the drama like I had with you for four years? RAKWAN, STOP! ARE YOU CRAZY? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? WE'RE JUST SUPPOSED TO BE WATCHING THE MOVIE AND THAT'S IT. I THINK YOU SHOULD GO. - I really don't care what you... - YOU KNOW WHAT? ...and your little angry crew are saying, but let me set the record straight. FORGET THIS. YOU KNOW, I DON'T NEED THIS CRAP. YOU AIN'T NOTHING BUT A TEASE. - I'm tired of dealing with angry black women. - I'M OUT OF HERE. Now where is my daughter? MONICA, I'M SO SORRY, HONEY. WE CAME IN AND WE FOUND THIS PLACE A MESS LIKE THIS. NO ONE'S BEEN ABLE TO FIND RAKWAN. WE THINK HE'S RUN OFF WITH YOUR PIECES. I'VE ALREADY CALLED THE POLICE. BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY YOU THINK HE MIGHT DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS? YEAH, I KNOW WHY. OH, SWEETIE, I'M SO SORRY. - ( crying ) - I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON THINGS. ( hip-hop music playing ) MONICA? MONICA. WHAT-- WHAT IS ALL THIS? I MEAN WHEN DID YOU DO ALL THIS WORK? I'VE BEEN STAYING UP ALL NIGHT, WORKING TO REPLACE EVERYTHING THAT WAS DESTROYED AS MY OWN THERAPY JUST SO I CAN COPE WITH ALL THE STUFF THAT'S BEEN GOING ON. WOW. THIS IS AMAZING. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. - YOU LIKE IT? - I LOVE IT. DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE OF THIS? YEAH, I'VE GOT A LOT OF IT IN MY ROOM. I'M GONNA TALK TO MISS RICHARDSON. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WELL, PRAISE THE LORD, PRAISE THE LORD. LORD, I THANK YOU FOR ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL DAY THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME. I THANK YOU FOR WAKING ME UP THIS MORNING AND STARTING ME ON MY WAY YET AGAIN. LORD, IN THE MIDST OF THIS BARREN LAND, YOU ARE STILL GOD, AND I WILL CONTINUE TO THANK YOU AND PRAISE YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE GOOD AND WORTHY TO BE PRAISED. "I WILL BLESS THE LORD AT ALL TIMES; HIS PRAISE SHALL CONTINUALLY BE IN MY MOUTH. OH, TASTE AND SEE THAT THE LORD IS GOOD! AND BLESSED IS THE MAN THAT TRUSTETH IN HIM." WHAT YOU SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS MORNING, MAMA? - CAN YOU SEE ME? - YEAH, I SEE YOU. - WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT? - CAN YOU HEAR ME? I THINK THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD CAN HEAR YOU, MAMA. WELL, THAT IS ALL THE REASON I NEED TO WAKE UP PRAISING GOD-- BECAUSE HE LET ME BREATHE ANOTHER DAY. WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING ALL THAT BREATH YOU BREATHING IS FREE. 'CAUSE, MAMA, IF IT COST ANYTHING, YOU'D BE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE RIGHT ABOUT NOW. THERE YOU GO, WORRYING ABOUT MONEY. DON'T MESS UP MY DAY WITH YOUR NEGATIVITY. IS THAT ALL YOU THINK ABOUT? MONEY? YES, ALL I THINK ABOUT-- MONEY. LOOK AT MY ROOTS. I CAN'T EVEN GET 'EM FIXED 'CAUSE I AIN'T GOT NO MONEY. MONEY IS EVERYTHING, MAMA. IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY, YOU DON'T HAVE NOTHING. WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE YOU LET PRIDE GET IN THE WAY OF YOUR JOB. PROVERBS SAY "PRIDE GOETH BEFORE A FALL." AND WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT YET, REGINA? YOU LET YOUR PRIDE GET IN THE WAY WHEN YOU HAD THAT ARGUMENT WITH MICHELLE. THAT'S WHY YOU QUIT YOUR JOB AND ENDED UP WHERE YOU ARE NOW. YOU SHOULD'VE CLEANED UP THAT MISUNDERSTANDING RIGHT THEN AND THERE, BUT YOU DIDN'T. NOW LOOK WHERE YOU ARE. THE WHOLE THING IS RIDICULOUS, AND I'M TIRED OF KEEPING QUIET ABOUT IT. IT WASN'T PRIDE, MAMA. I QUIT MY JOB 'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA STAND THERE AND BE ACCUSED OF SOMETHING THAT I DID NOT DO. IT WASN'T PRIDE? THEN WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? YOU SHOULD'VE CLEANED UP ANY MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND KEPT YOUR JOB. IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE. DURING THESE HARD TIMES WHEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING, YOU'RE JUST GONNA QUIT YOUR JOB OVER SOME MAN THAT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW OR HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH? ARE YOU CRAZY? AGAIN, IF THAT'S NOT PRIDE, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? YOU KNOW THE SCRIPTURE THAT SAYS "A FOOL AND HIS MONEY ARE SOON PARTED," RIGHT? HUH. WELL, WHERE'S YOUR MONEY? - ARE YOU CALLING ME A FOOL? - DID YOU QUIT YOUR JOB? - YES, I DID. - DO YOU HAVE ANY MONEY? - NO. - WELL, THEN I REST MY CASE. I'LL LET THE EVIDENCE POINT WHERE IT POINTS. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU JUST CALLED ME A FOOL. OH, DON'T GET YOUR PANTIES ALL UP IN A BUNCH. I'M JUST SAYING SOMETIMES WE MAKE OUR BED AND THEN WE DON'T WANNA LAY IN IT. YOU BROUGHT A LOT OF THIS ON YOURSELF AND NOW YOU'RE MAKING EVERYBODY PAY FOR IT BY BEING SO MEAN AND BITTER TO EVERYBODY AROUND YOU. YOU'VE BEEN CHASING THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR ALL YOUR LIFE AND PUTTING EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING ON THE BACK BURNER TO DO IT. NOW LOOK WHERE YOU'VE ENDED UP, AND IT AIN'T RICH. MAMA, I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING YOUR RUNDOWN ABOUT HOW I NEGLECTED MY FAMILY FOR MY JOB. I DID WHAT I THOUGHT I HAD TO DO SO THAT I COULD BE INDEPENDENT AND NOT HAVE TO RELY ON ANYBODY ELSE, JUST LIKE YOU TAUGHT ME TO DO. I DID A GOOD JOB, MAMA! AND I RAISED MY KIDS! NO, REGINA, YOUR KIDS GREW UP! THAT'S A LAW OF NATURE! DON'T GET GROWING UP CONFUSED WITH BEING RAISED! IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR MARCUS-- OH, HERE WE GO WITH MARCUS AGAIN! HOW GOOD MARCUS IS AND HOW BAD I AM. WHAT IS SO WRONG WITH WANTING SOMETHING FOR MYSELF? LOOK AT ME, MAMA. I DIDN'T SLEEP MY WAY TO THE TOP. I DIDN'T STEAL. I DIDN'T KILL NOBODY. NO, YOU KNOW WHAT I DID? I WORKED, MAMA, AND I WORKED VERY HARD. AND I AM SICK AND TIRED OF BEING MADE TO FEEL BAD FOR THAT! I DID IT FOR MYSELF AND FOR MY FAMILY, BUT I GUESS THAT'S HARD FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND, MAMA. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE YOU NEVER WANTED MUCH OUT OF LIFE. SO I GUESS IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU THAT WE AIN'T GOT NOTHING. NO, I DON'T NEED MUCH IN LIFE. MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE THAT WAS THE WAY I WAS RAISED. MY PARENTS DIDN'T HAVE MUCH EITHER, BUT WE HAD FAMILY AND WE HAD LOVE. I REMEMBER MY FIRST CAR. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW OLD THAT CAR WAS WHEN MY MAMA BOUGHT IT, BUT IT WAS ALL SHE COULD AFFORD, AND I WAS GRATEFUL FOR IT. THE ODOMETER DIDN'T WORK AND THE GAS GAUGE DIDN'T WORK. I HAD TO STICK A YARDSTICK IN THE GAS TANK TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH GAS I HAD BEFORE I COULD GO ANYWHERE. I GOT TO KNOW THAT I COULD GO TO AND FROM SCHOOL ON ONE INCH OF GAS. I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I TURNED ON THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS. THE WIPER ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE FELL OFF AND I HAD TO DRIVE DOWN THE STREET LOOKING THROUGH THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD. AND THE HEADLIGHTS WERE COCKEYED-- ONE SHINED UP IN THE SKY, BLINDING THE AIRPLANES, AND THE OTHER SHINED INTO THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE WALKING DOWN THE STREET. WHEN I DROVE THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD AT NIGHT, THE PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THE COPS WERE RAIDING THEIR HOMES, BECAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE SEARCHLIGHTS SHINING IN THEIR WINDOWS. OH, AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WANTED MORE FOR MY KIDS. THAT'S WHY I GAVE YOU ALL STUFF THAT I NEVER HAD, BUT I WAS NEVER ABLE TO SATISFY YOUR CHAMPAGNE TASTES. AND WHEN I GAVE YOU A CAR FOR YOUR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION, YOU GOT MAD BECAUSE YOU WANTED A HONDA, BUT I BOUGHT YOU A HYUNDAI. YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE JONESES ALL YOUR LIFE. WELL, NEWSFLASH, SWEETIE-- YOUR NAME IS REYNOLDS AND BEFORE THAT IT WAS KNEALY. AND YOU AIN'T NEVER BEEN NO JONES, - SO GET OVER IT. - YOU'LL NEVER GET IT, WILL YOU, MAMA? YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. IF IT MAKES ME ACT THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN ACTING ALL YOUR LIFE, - I HOPE I NEVER GET IT! - WHATEVER, MAMA! AND YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE ALWAYS GIVING ME THOSE BIBLE SCRIPTURES AND THOSE QUOTES FROM FAMOUS PEOPLE? WELL, HERE'S A BIBLE SCRIPTURE FOR YOU-- "THE WEALTH OF THE WICKED IS LAID UPON THE RIGHTEOUS." WELL, I AM THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD. - WHY DIDN'T YOU GIVE ME THAT SCRIPTURE, MAMA? - OH. OH. GOD, FORGIVE HER. OH, GIVE ME THE STRENGTH. HOLD ME BACK, JESUS. HOLD ME BACK. ( car alarm beeps ) HEY, IT'S ME-- MARCUS. MARCUS! COME IN. ( sighs ) REGINA JUST LEFT, WHICH IS PROBABLY A GOOD THING CONSIDERING HOW SHE'S BEEN ACTING THESE DAYS. YEAH, I JUST SAW HER FLYING OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR HER MORNING JOG. I CALLED AFTER HER, BUT SHE JUST KEPT RUNNING. - OH. - KIND OF LIKE SHE DOES IN LIFE IN GENERAL. Georgia: WELL, SHE PROBABLY COULDN'T HEAR YOU BECAUSE SHE'S GOT ON HER iPOD. IT'S A GOOD THING SHE GOT OUT OF HERE WHEN SHE DID. THINGS WERE GETTING A LITTLE HEATED IN HERE. - WHAT HAPPENED? - WELL, WE HAD A LITTLE TIFF ABOUT REGINA AND HER TASTE FOR THE GOOD LIFE. WELL, THAT'S NOTHING NEW. I MEANT WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE FURNITURE? OH, I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU. SHE LOST HER JOB ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO. - WHAT? - SHE'S BROKE, STUBBORN AND WON'T LET ME HELP HER. AND THEY REPOSSESSED HER CAR TOO. AND TODAY WE GOT A FORECLOSURE NOTICE ON THE HOUSE. NOW I'VE GOTTA DO SOMETHING, BECAUSE I AM NOT GOING TO BE HOMELESS BECAUSE OF HER BAD DECISIONS. WELL, I WAS COMING OVER TO TELL HER SOME GOOD NEWS, BUT I GUESS SHE WON'T BE IN THE MOOD TO APPRECIATE IT. OH, GIVE IT TO ME, BECAUSE I DO NEED IT. BUT JUST DON'T TELL ME YOU FOUND A NEW WOMAN, BECAUSE THAT WON'T BE GOOD NEWS FOR HER OR ME. NO, MOM. CLOSE BUT IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, MARCUS? RELAX. I'M TALKING ABOUT MONICA. - OH. - SHE'S DOING REALLY WELL. YEAH, AND SHE'S LIKE A NEW PERSON NEXT TO HOW SHE WAS WHEN SHE WENT IN. AND SHE'S COMING HOME SOON. OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HER. YEAH, AND THE GOOD NEWS IS TODAY IS HER PRE-RELEASE EVALUATION. SO SAY A PRAYER THAT THEY FEEL SHE'S READY TO COME HOME, BECAUSE I MISS HER. AND MONICA ALSO HAD SOME NEWS SHE WANTED TO SHARE WITH ALL OF US, BUT SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME WHAT IT WAS. OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL, MARCUS. YEAH. I WANTED TO SHARE THE NEWS WITH REGINA. I WAS HOPING THAT IT WOULD MAKE HER FEEL BETTER ABOUT MONICA AND THINGS, BUT I GUESS IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN TODAY. I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME FOR HER. WELL, I WOULDN'T GET MY HOPES UP IF I WERE YOU. SHE DOES HAVE A LOT OF FEELINGS THAT SHE HAS TO DEAL WITH ABOUT MONICA. AND WE WON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT THIS NEW MESS. I KNOW IT'S BEEN HARD FOR REGINA WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH MONICA AND THIS SITUATION, BUT I ALSO KNOW SHE LOVES HER DAUGHTER VERY MUCH. OKAY, WE'RE ALL GONNA GET THROUGH THIS, OKAY, MOM? AND I GOTTA GO, ALL RIGHT? MAMA, WHAT'S WRONG? YOU DON'T LOOK GOOD. MARCUS, WHAT REALLY HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND REGINA? - OH. - I KNOW YOU LET HER GO TO MAKE A POINT, BUT COULDN'T YOU HAVE HELD ONTO HER AND MADE YOUR POINT IN ANOTHER WAY? YOUR FAMILY HAS FALLEN APART, SON. I DID WHAT I THOUGHT WAS BEST AT THE TIME. REGINA KNOWS HOW I FEEL ABOUT HER. BUT OUR MARRIAGE WASN'T IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR HER TO MAKE THE COMPROMISES SHE HAD TO FOR THE FAMILY. IT WAS ALL ABOUT HER CAREER AND NOT ABOUT US. SHE WANTED MORE, SO I LET HER GO AND FIND IT. HOW LONG AND HOW HARD CAN YOU HOLD ONTO SOMEONE WHO IS SELFISH AND WANTS TO BE FREE? SHE'S A GROWN WOMAN, MOM. I CAN'T HOLD ONTO HER AGAINST HER WILL. I UNDERSTAND, MARCUS. BUT WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LET HER DIVORCE YOU. TRY AND HOLD ONTO HER FOR ALL OF OUR SAKES. THE BALL IS IN HER COURT AND SHE KNOWS IT. SHE'S ALWAYS KNOWN THAT I'D TAKE HER BACK. SHE JUST HAS TO SAY THE WORD AND I'LL ACT AS IF NONE OF THIS EVER HAPPENED. I HATE SEEING HER THIS WAY, BUT I CAN'T MAKE HER WANT ME OR WANT A LIFE WITH ME. I LOVE HER WITH ALL MY HEART, BUT I CAN'T STAND IN HER WAY IF SHE WANTS TO BE FREE. OKAY? BUT REALLY, I GOTTA GO, MOM. ( Marcus sighs ) BYE, MARCUS. OH LORD... ( crying ) THANK YOU FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER. OH PLEASE, LET HER MAKE A FRESH START AND LET IT STICK THIS TIME. THIS WHOLE FAMILY NEEDS A FRESH START. AND SEND MY SILLY DAUGHTER HOME TO HER HUSBAND. LORD, IF I'D HAVE HAD ONE LIKE HIM, I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO RAISE MY GIRLS ALONE. WELL, MONICA, IT'S TIME FOR YOUR EVALUATION. YOU KNOW JACK, OF COURSE, AND THIS IS MR. CHARLES. AND WE'RE JUST GONNA EVALUATE YOU TODAY. I KNOW THIS CAN BE SCARY, BUT PLEASE JUST TRY TO RELAX. WE ALL WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE CENTER. WE DO. WE JUST WANT TO BE SURE YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT COMING BACK HERE. OUR MAIN CONCERN IS WHERE YOU'LL BE STAYING IF YOUR MOTHER WON'T LET YOU BACK INTO HER HOUSE. WELL, MY DAD SAID THAT I COULD STAY AT HIS HOUSE. HE SAID I'M-- I'M WELCOME THERE. WELL, THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S WONDERFUL. BUT HE TRAVELS A LOT, SO WHO'S GONNA BE THERE TO MONITOR YOU, MAKE SURE YOU DON'T GET BACK WITH THE SAME PEOPLE AND END UP HERE AGAIN? YEAH, THAT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TOO STABLE TO ME. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR OF A BETTER PLAN, FOR YOUR PROTECTION. WE'RE JUST NOT SURE THAT YOU'RE READY FOR THAT MUCH FREEDOM YET. I'LL BE FINE. I'LL WATCH MYSELF. JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE TO PROVE MYSELF. I'M DIFFERENT NOW. REALLY. I'M READY. I CAN DO THIS. OKAY. THAT'S THE KIND OF CONFIDENCE - WE'VE BEEN WAITING TO HEAR. - ( Monica chuckles ) YES. OKAY. WE WILL. WE'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE. WE'RE GONNA START OUT WITH TWO WEEKS AND THEN WE'LL CHECK IN ON YOU. AND IF THAT GOES WELL, THEN WE'LL GIVE YOU TWO MONTHS. AND THEN IF THAT GOES WELL, - YOU'LL BE FREE. - YEAH, TWO WEEKS. YEAH. OKAY. SO YOU CAN LEAVE HERE TOMORROW. - TOMORROW? - YES. - ( laughs ) - LISTEN, I REALLY BELIEVE IN YOU. - CONGRATULATIONS. - THANK YOU. SO GO OUT THERE AND MAKE US ALL PROUD. MAKE YOURSELF PROUD. - THANK YOU SO MUCH. - YOU'RE WELCOME. GOOD LUCK, MONICA. - MR. CHARLES. - Charles: GOODBYE. WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR-- - YOUR ISSUE. - YOUR NARCOLEPSY. WHAT? ( footsteps approaching ) - YOU'RE GOING RUNNING AGAIN? - ( softly ) YEAH. THAT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S ALL YOU DO, REGINA. YOU NEED TO BE OUT LOOKING FOR A JOB. STOP TRYING TO RUN AWAY FROM YOUR PROBLEMS. WHAT?! COME ON, MOM. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - OH. - EXCUSE ME. WELL, IF YOU CAN'T HEAR ME, MAYBE I NEED TO WRITE IT DOWN SO YOU CAN READ IT. ( emphatically ) YOU NEED A JOB, REGINA. TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW! DON'T YOU EVER RAISE YOUR VOICE AND USE THAT TONE TO ME AGAIN. ( sighs ) I AM YOUR MOTHER AND I WILL BE UNTIL THE DAY I DIE, AND YOU WILL NOT DISRESPECT ME. YES, MA'AM. I'M GONNA GO RUN NOW, MA'AM. DO I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION? GO ON, REGINA. LORD, I AIN'T SLAPPED NOBODY IN 20 YEARS. GOD, YOU MAY HAVE TO GIVE ME THE STRENGTH TO SLAP THE DEVIL OUT OF MY DAUGHTER IF SHE EVER TALKS TO ME LIKE THAT AGAIN. OH, LET ME READ MY WORD. LET ME FIND THAT SCRIPTURE ABOUT "THOU SHALT NOT KILL." THAT SHOULD WORK RIGHT ABOUT NOW. JESUS. ( sighs ) ( both laughing ) - BABY. - ( squeals ) DADDY! - YOU LOOK WONDERFUL! - THANK YOU. - HOW'S MOM? - ( groans ) NOT GOOD. SEE, A LOT HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY AND NONE OF IT'S MAKING YOUR MOTHER A HAPPIER PERSON. WHAT, DAD? REALLY, IS SHE OKAY? YEAH, SHE'S OKAY, BUT NOTHING AROUND HER IS. SHE'S BEEN OUT OF WORK FOR SIX MONTHS NOW - AND EVEN WORSE-- - WAIT. WHAT, DADDY? I WASN'T EVEN GONE FOR THAT LONG. HOW MUCH COULD HAPPEN IN SIX MONTHS? A LOT. YOU MOTHER NEVER REALLY HAD SAVINGS. SHE'S BEEN LIVING AT HER MEANS. AND SHE LOST HER CAR AND ALL OF THE FURNITURE. THE HOUSE IS COMPLETELY EMPTY. - WHAT, DADDY? - YEAH. I KNOW HOW MUCH THAT STUFF MEANT TO HER. HOW IS SHE DOING? COME ON, MONICA. YOU KNOW YOUR MOTHER. I MEAN NOT GOOD AT ALL. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HER. I'VE BEEN HELPING HER WITH THE HOUSE WHILE TAKING CARE OF MY BILLS, BUT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH I CAN DO. I MEAN SHE WAS MAKING MORE THAN ME. ( sighs ) I REALLY HATE TO SEE HER LIKE THIS. KNOW WHAT, DAD? I FORGOT-- I NEED TO GO MAKE A PHONE CALL. CAN YOU WATCH MY BAG? - BABY, JUST USE MY PHONE. - THERE'S PROBABLY NO SERVICE. SURE ENOUGH, SHE'S RIGHT. HMM. ( panting ) HOO. HOW WAS YOUR RUN, REGINA? IT WAS GOOD, MOTHER. WELL, ANY OTHER TIME IT'D BE "MAMA." YOU STILL MAD, BUT THAT'S OKAY. - YOU'LL GET OVER IT. - MAMA, I REALLY DON'T WANNA GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN. - YOU KNOW, YOUR NAGGING IS GETTING REAL OLD. - ( knocks on door ) NOW BEFORE YOU GO STORMING OFF TO YOUR ROOM LIKE USUAL, DO YOU MIND GETTING THE DOOR THIS TIME? IT'S YOUR SHIFT. I'VE ALREADY DONE MINE. ( sighs ) OH GOD. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE MAKING ME COME OVER HERE AND DO THIS. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE ME ANYMORE AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER EITHER. LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA KEEP ARGUING WITH YOU ABOUT THIS. MICHELLE, YOU NEED TO FIX IT. - YOU DON'T NEED TO KEEP-- - YOU NEED HER. DON'T NEED TO KEEP WHAT? HI, REGINA. SO WHAT DO I OWE TO THIS DISPLEASURE? YOU KNOW WHAT? I TOLD YOU THIS WASN'T A GOOD IDEA. SEE? I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, REGINA, MAY WE PLEASE COME IN FOR A SECOND? WE WILL NOT STAY LONG. I PROMISE. WELL, MY DAY COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE. COME ON IN. GET GOING. ( sighs ) SO I BROUGHT MICHELLE HERE BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL HAVE SOME THINGS WE NEED TO CLEAR UP. MICHELLE TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED AND-- AND I'M SURE SHE GAVE YOU HER TWISTED VERSION OF THINGS. LOOK, REGINA, I AM TIRED OF YOU DISRESPECTING ME. FIRST I'M STUPID, NOW I'M TWISTED? - YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S GO. - FIRST, REGINA-- SHH-TCH! FIRST, REGINA, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR ANY MISUNDERSTANDINGS I MAY HAVE CAUSED. I REALLY DIDN'T COME OFF PROFESSIONAL OR RIGHT THE FIRST TIME WE MET AND I'M VERY SORRY. MICHELLE AND I HAVE HAD A LONG CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS AND WE'VE GOT THINGS STRAIGHT BETWEEN US. WE ARE A COUPLE AND NOW I THINK IT'S TIME THAT YOU TWO GET THINGS STRAIGHT. MICHELLE IS HERE TO OFFER YOU YOUR JOB BACK. YES, REGINA, YOU CAN HAVE YOUR JOB BACK IF YOU WANT IT. - I MEAN, YOU TWO HAVE WORKED SO HARD-- - Regina: NO NO NO NO NO. LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT-- I HAVE WORKED VERY HARD. OH, REGINA, RIGHT NOW THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH IS IN THAT TONGUE OF YOURS. NOW DON'T CHOOSE DEATH AGAIN. CHOOSE LIFE, DUMMY. I GOT THIS, MAMA. COULD WE HAVE JUST A MINUTE? - WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. - CERTAINLY. REGINA, WE'RE IN A RECESSION AND YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS DEPLETED TO THE POINT THAT IT'S INSIDE OUT. NOW IF YOU WON'T LISTEN TO A BIBLE VERSE, WILL YOU PLEASE AT LEAST LISTEN TO A FAMOUS MOVIE ONE? "STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES," AND RIGHT NOW YOU'RE BEHAVING VERY STUPID. NOW GET OVER THERE AND GET YOUR JOB BACK AND SAVE THIS HOUSE. - MICHELLE. - Michelle: YES? CAN I THINK ABOUT THIS? SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA TO ME. SPENCER, LET'S GO. I'VE DONE MY PART. AS MUCH AS SHE HATES TO ADMIT IT, THE MAGAZINE REALLY NEEDS YOU, REGINA. - ( Regina chuckles ) OH. - OH COME ON, SPENCER, PLEASE. I AM NOT GONNA KEEP APOLOGIZING - TO SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO KEEP AN ATTITUDE WITH ME. - OKAY. - LET'S GO SIT DOWN. - THANK YOU. OH, I'M SORRY. THERE'S NOTHING TO SIT ON. - Georgia: YES. - PLEASE CONSIDER IT. - GOOD NIGHT. - GOOD NIGHT. OH GOD, WHAT A MESS. NOW WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, GINA? I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT IT, MAMA. THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO. SHE'S NOT THINKING ABOUT GETTING ME BACK. SHE'S JUST TRYING TO IMPRESS SPENCER. SHE DOESN'T WANT ME WORKING WITH HER. OH, WHAT DO YOU CARE ABOUT WHETHER SHE CARES OR NOT? SHE'S OFFERING YOUR JOB BACK AND YOU HAVEN'T WORKED IN SIX MONTHS. WE'RE IN TROUBLE HERE. - ( mutters ) - WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I GOTTA GO TAKE A WALK. I GOTTA GO CLEAR MY HEAD. ( door opens, shuts ) OH. OH GOD. WELL, WITH ALL THIS RUNNING AND WALKING, AT LEAST SHE'LL BE IN GOOD SHAPE. - ( adults chatting ) - ( kids playing ) Girl: MOMMY, MOMMY, PUSH ME HIGHER. MOMMY, MOMMY, PUSH ME HIGHER. MOMMY, MOMMY, PUSH ME HIGHER. MOMMY, MOMMY, PUSH ME HIGHER. MOMMY, MOMMY, PUSH ME HIGHER. MOMMY, MOMMY, PUSH ME HIGHER. MOMMY, MOMMY, PUSH ME HIGHER! ( echoing ) MOMMY, MOMMY, PUSH ME HIGHER. MOMMY, MOMMY, PUSH ME HIGHER. MOMMY, MOMMY, PUSH ME HIGHER. MOMMY, MOMMY, PUSH ME HIGHER. ( kids playing ) ( crying ) - ( knocks on door ) - Georgia: OH, WHO IS IT NOW? - I'M COMING. - HEY, MOM, IT'S MARCUS. - OH MARCUS! - ( both laugh ) - OH. OH. - AND ME, GRANDMA. - MONICA! - ( laughing ) HI. OH, IS IT REALLY YOU? - YES. - OH, YOU LOOK WONDERFUL. YES, GRANDMA, IT'S ME, THE NEW AND IMPROVED MONICA. OH OH, I ALWAYS KNEW THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY IN THERE JUST TRYING TO GET OUT. AND YOU JUST LOOK MARVELOUS. - ARE YOU HOME FOR GOOD NOW? - NO, GRANDMA. I'M ONLY HOME FOR A FEW DAYS AS A TRIAL. MY COUNSELORS-- THEY THOUGHT I WAS SORT OF READY, SO THIS IS A TEST RUN TO SEE IF I CAN HANDLE THINGS AND NOT SLIP BACK INTO MY OLD HABITS AGAIN. WELL, SPEAKING OF HANDLING THINGS, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOUR MOTHER'S GONNA HANDLE SEEING YOU AFTER THE WAY YOU TWO PARTED. OH, SHE'S BEEN GOING THROUGH A VERY ROUGH TIME LATELY. BUT SEEING YOU LIKE THIS IS GONNA MAKE HER HAPPY. - I KNOW IT IS. - I DON'T KNOW, GRANDMA. WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN MONTHS AND YOU KNOW SHE WASN'T REALLY THAT HAPPY WITH ME THE LAST TIME WE SAW EACH OTHER. WELL, LIKE YOU SAID, THAT WAS MONTHS AGO. WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE HOW SHE HANDLES THINGS TODAY. OH, SHE-- SEEING YOU IS GONNA MAKE HER HAPPY. - I JUST KNOW IT. - ( both laugh ) ( Regina panting ) ( knocks on door ) MOM, LET ME IN. I LEFT MY KEYS. OH, Y'ALL GO AND HIDE IN THE HALL CLOSET. I'LL SEE HOW SHE'S FEELING BEFORE YOU COME IN. ( knocks ) MOM, LET ME IN. - WHERE'S YOUR KEY? - I DON'T KNOW. I FORGOT 'EM. - OH. - HEY, MOM, SO, MA, IS THAT MARCUS'S CAR OUT THERE? WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF CARS THAT LOOK LIKE MARCUS'S CAR. SO THAT'S-- I-I-- I THOUGHT-- YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HIM. OH. WELL, WHAT HAPPENED? DID YOU COME TO ANY CONCLUSIONS ABOUT ANYTHING WHILE YOU WERE OUT? MMM. I'M OKAY, MA. I'M REALLY OKAY. - YOU SURE? TALK TO ME. - I-- I JUST FEEL LIKE-- REMEMBER SAUL ON THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS. OF COURSE. I USED TO READ YOU THAT STORY. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN GOD STRUCK HIM AND HE WENT BLIND? - YES. YES. - HE WENT BLIND FOR THREE DAYS AND THEN WHEN HE CAME BACK, YOU REMEMBER HOW HE SAW THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS? MM-HMM, YES. WELL, I WAS RUNNING TODAY... - MM-HMM. - ...AND I WAS TRYING TO CLEAR MY HEAD. I WAS TRYING TO HEAR FROM GOD, MAMA... - OH. - ...AND I JUST STARTED LOOKING AT PEOPLE GOING BY. I SAW THIS MOTHER. SHE WAS PLAYING WITH HER KIDS. SHE WAS PUSHING HER CHILD ON THE SWING. AND, MAMA, THAT-- THE MOTHER LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS HAVING SO MUCH FUN WITH THAT LITTLE GIRL. AND THEN I SAW THE FATHER, AND HE WAS FLYING A KITE WITH HIS SON. THEY WERE HAVING FUN. AND THERE WAS A COUPLE-- A COUPLE ABOUT MY AGE-- AND THEY WERE ON A BLANKET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARK, JUST LAUGHING, ENJOYING EACH OTHER. AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THE FACT THAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN ON A BLANKET... - OH. - ...WITH MARCUS. - OH. - I THINK I JUST PASSED SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES, MA. I-- I HAVEN'T BEEN A GOOD MOTHER. - I HAVEN'T BEEN A GOOD WIFE. - OH. OH. I WANT THOSE CHANCES BACK, AND I THINK IT'S TOO LATE. I NEVER SAT ON A BLANKET AND HAD A PICNIC. OH, REGINA. I NEVER HAD FUN WITH MY CHILD. I NEVER-- I NEVER PUSHED MONICA ON A SWING. - OH. - MOM, I WANNA CHANGE MY LIFE. - OH. - I'M SO SORRY, MAMA. IT'S ALL RIGHT, BABY. IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, WE GOTTA ASK GOD'S WILL IN YOUR LIFE, AND HE'LL CHANGE THINGS. I THINK HE TALKED TO ME TODAY. I'M SURE HE DID. OH, REGINA. OH, BABY. - OH, LOOK AT ME. - ( cries ) MA. NOW YOU KNOW, LIKE SAUL, YOU CAN PICK YOURSELF UP, DUST YOURSELF OFF AND GO ON FORWARD. YOU KNOW? AND LISTEN, I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY. I DON'T EVER WANT YOU TO THINK THAT I'M NOT PROUD OF YOU, BECAUSE I AM. YOU'RE A VERY AMBITIOUS WOMAN AND A VERY STRONG WOMAN. YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER AND I LOVE YOU DEARLY. ( crying ) I WANT MY DAUGHTER BACK, MA. I OWE HER SO MANY APOLOGIES. - OH BABY. - I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I THINK I HAVE MISSED EVERY OPPORTUNITY. I-- I'LL NEVER HAVE A CHANCE TO BE A GOOD MOTHER. - OH YES, YOU WILL. - AND I LOST THE MAN THAT I LOVE. OH REGINA, IT'S NOT OVER. AND I'M GONNA APOLOGIZE TO YOU, MAMA. - FOR WHAT, BABY? - I HAVE NOT BEEN A GOOD PERSON, MAMA. I PUT EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE BEFORE YOU, BEFORE MY DAUGHTER, BEFORE THE MAN THAT I LOVE-- MY HUSBAND. YES, WELL, WE CAN JUST PUT GOD'S WILL BACK IN OUR LIVES. I'VE LOST EVERYTHING, MAMA-- EVERYTHING. BUT LIKE SAUL, YOU CAN GET IT BACK. MOM, I JUST-- I THINK IT'S TOO LATE. - NO. NO, IT'S NEVER TOO LATE. - YES, I DON'T THINK-- - YES, IT IS. - YOU'LL SEE, REGINA. IT'S NEVER TOO LATE. - I'M RIGHT HERE, MAMA. - OH MY GOD! - SEE? SEE? - OH MY BABY! - OH MY BABY. - I'M SO SORRY, MAMA. OH MARCUS, LOOK AT OUR BABY. LOOK AT YOU. OH, SWEETHEART, WILL YOU EVER FORGIVE ME? - PLEASE? - NO, MAMA, YOU WERE FORGIVEN THE MINUTE I WALKED IN THE HOUSE. IT'S ME WHO YOU NEED TO FORGIVE FOR DOING ALL THOSE THINGS TO YOU. AND THEN AFTER THAT WE CAN GO SWING AND GO TO THE PARK. - OH BABY. - I MISSED YOU SO MUCH. I MISSED YOU TOO, MY DARLING. I'VE MISSED YOU TOO. WE'RE GONNA DO THAT. WE'RE GONNA SWING. WE'RE GOING TO BE A FAMILY AGAIN. ALWAYS. MARCUS, WILL YOU TAKE ME BACK? ( sighs ) WELL, I DON'T KNOW. - THAT'S ALL RIGHT. - I NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT. - OH. OH. - Regina: SEE, I TOLD YOU. - I THOUGHT ABOUT IT. YES. - ( gasps ) ( Georgia and Monica laugh ) OH MARCUS. OH! ( sobbing ) OH. MOM. ( knocks on door ) OH, Y'ALL GO ON. I GOT THIS. THIS HOUSE IS BUSIER THAN GRAND CENTRAL STATION. - WHO IS IT NOW? - Man: PAPA JOE'S FURNITURE EMPORIUM. WELL, WHAT YOU WANT? WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE FOR YOU TO TAKE. MAMA, YOU LET THEM COME IN HERE AND TAKE WHATEVER THEY WANT, BECAUSE EVERYTHING I NEED I ALREADY HAVE RIGHT HERE. - COME AND TAKE IT ALL. - NO, MA'AM, I'M NOT HERE TO TAKE ANYTHING. I'M HERE TO BRING SOMETHING BACK. JUST SIGN RIGHT HERE AND I'LL BRING IT IN. I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY. I DIDN'T ORDER ANYTHING. YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THAT. MA'AM, IT'S ALREADY BEEN TAKEN CARE OF. JUST SIGN AND I'LL BRING THE STUFF IN. IT'S GOT MY NAME AND ADDRESS ON IT, BABY. WELL, BRING IT ON. ALL RIGHT, FELLAS, MOVE IT IN. COME ON. - WHAT? - WHAT IS THIS? OH, IT'S YOUR FURNITURE. OH MY GOODNESS. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? - WHO DID-- MAMA, THANK YOU. - OH, I DIDN'T DO IT, BUT I'LL TAKE THE HUG. I NEED ONE ABOUT NOW. MAMA, THIS IS ALL OUR FURN-- MARCUS, YOU DID THIS. BABY, THANK YOU. SORRY, BABE, I WISH I COULD TAKE THE CREDIT, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. WELL, THEN WHO DID THIS? HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? - IT WAS ME, MAMA. - ( gasps ) - MONICA? - YOU? WAIT A MINUTE. MONICA, HOW DID YOU DO THIS? WELL, WHEN WE WERE ON OUR WAY HOME FROM REHAB, DAD HAD TOLD ME WHAT HAD HAPPENED, SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE UP FOR ALL THE BAD THINGS I'VE DONE, SO I CALLED PAPA JOE'S AND I MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MY DEBIT CARD TO HAVE YOUR STUFF BACK. - Regina: OH MY GOD. - ( giggles ) Regina: WAIT WAIT, BUT-- BUT HOW DID-- HOW DID YOU DO IT? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WELL, MOM, DAD, I'VE BEEN PAINTING AGAIN SINCE I'VE BEEN IN REHAB. AND THE DIRECTOR SAW MY STUFF AND HE THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE AN ART SHOW AND I DID AND I SOLD ALL MY ARTWORK AND I MADE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET MOM'S STUFF BACK. - WHAT? - YEAH. OH, BABY, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU. I AM SO PROUD OF YOU, MONICA. I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH. I'VE MISSED ALL THOSE THINGS ABOUT YOU THAT MAKE YOU SO SPECIAL. AND I'M GONNA BE A GOOD MOTHER TO YOU-- I PROMISE YOU THAT-- IF YOU'LL JUST LET ME. I TOLD YOU I WAS GONNA MAKE YOU PROUD OF ME ONE DAY. - ( chuckles ) AND YOU HAVE. - I HOPE I DID. - OH YES, YOU HAVE. - I HAVE. OH MY BABY. OH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ( whispers ) THANKS, GOD. PUSH ME, MAMA. PUSH ME! OH, YOU ARE TOO BIG AND TOO OLD FOR THAT. - WHEE! - BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I OWE YOU ONE. - ( grunts ) - ( both laughing ) MOM-- OKAY, MOM. NEVER MIND, MAMA. STOP. NEVER TOO LATE, GIRLFRIEND. OKAY, I DIDN'T MEAN IT, MAMA. ( instrumental music playing ) ( classical score playing )
