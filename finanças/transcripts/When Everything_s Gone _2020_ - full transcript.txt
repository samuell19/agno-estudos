Where to begin. I guess I'll explain how it all went down. There was a plague of biblical proportions. An epidemic that devastated the world as we knew it. People died, thousands at a time. Overnight, everything had changed. It was like one of those old zombie films, except, no one was coming back. They were all gone. An entire planet of people, dead. Except for me. I'm the last of us. Well, there you have it. Welcome to the new world. Are you scared? No, why would I be? It's just a bunch of wood and bugs. Yeah, bugs. How are we gonna find our way home, Rory? It's our first adventure of our own and you already wanna go home? God, you're such a baby. I'm not a baby. Where are we? I don't know, but I know which way we came from. We just have to leave some sort of like trail. Like Hansel and Gretel? Yeah. Home. - That way? - That way. Are you sure? Look, we're men of the forest now. We gotta use our surroundings to find our way home. Use it how? You know? Using the dirt, the trees, the sky. Everything that the explorers used when they explored the world, we can use it too. I don't see anything. What were you expecting? A map? Be patient. I'm not sure where I am anymore. Or where I'm going. I've been out here for months, and the days, they're starting to blur together. I can barely sleep. And whenever I do, I see his face. I hear his voice. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are there no more monsters out there, hiding in the darkness? Is it all really gone? Take care of your brother. I'm not gonna abandon them. Are you scared? It's all right. Calm down. Just take it easy young man. Are you one of them? One of... You can't be. You can't be real. - You can't be real. - Put the knife down. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. I got something, man. Shit, it's a fighter. Oh, look at that. That is a beautiful fish. Yeah, just beautiful. Yeah, you got lucky, dude. You wanna get me a towel or something to wrap this in, or are we throwing it back? Want a drag? Yeah, why not? The world's gone to hell. I might as well. How much farther? Another a mile, maybe two. This is fun, isn't it? Yeah. It's kind of like when we went camping as kids, you know. You couldn't catch fish then either. Yeah, I just don't have the patients to sit there and wait for a bite, I'd rather do something more proactive. Proactive, huh? Well, if you wanna do some more proactive, why don't you go get some firewood so we can cook up this here fish? It really is the end, isn't it? You must've been thirsty. Where am I? You're in my home. You've seen better days, young man. Who are you? My name is Casper. You're lucky I found you when I did. I had to give you an IV drip. You were pretty dehydrated. You were running a fever for a couple of days. You were passed out from exhaustion. Do I have it? No. You're clean. You're immune. We all are. How can you be certain? I tested your blood. So, you're a doctor? Well, I was. After this happened, I grabbed as much lab equipment as I could carry, that, which allowed me to test our blood, to be sure, to be certain. This is my daughter, Rosie. Rosie meet our house guest. What's your name? It's Rory. How much do you know about what happened? I thought I was the last one... Hey, it's okay. It's fine. You're one of us. The lucky few. How's that possible? Well, we were all exposed, but somehow our immune systems created antibodies and our cells didn't break down. They fused with it, and we survived. What would make that happen? We're not sure. Natural selection. Fate, luck. Governments fell, societies crumbled, people hid, scavenged, whatever it took. And here we are. Come with me. I wanna show you something. Is it... No, she has an inoperable tumor. Sorry. We're all lost people. I'm sorry about the knife. If I frightened you. You were delusional. Dehydration and exhaustion those things can mess with your head. I'll be out of your hair before you know it. Take as long as you need, unless you have somewhere else you need to be. Yeah. My dad's shutting off the generator for the night. Thanks. Welcome. I thought I was gonna die. I had that knife. I thought I was gonna kill myself. Why are you telling me this? I don't know. You saved me. I just wanted to thank you for that. Why were you going to kill yourself? Well, I figured it was all over anyway. So, why delay the inevitable? You could've left me for dead. Sent me back out there instead of inviting me in. The world's gone to shit. The least we can do is be decent, right? Goodnight. Goodnight. We used to go to this diner back home. Me and my brother. We'd always ordered the same thing. Frenh toast and chicken pot pie. We'd stay there for hours just drinking chocolate milk. He was back from school when it hit. We drove as far as we could, until we hit the blockades. It was a brilliant idea to put up massive barricades. Keep everyone grounded. Quarantine it, keep it all in house. Didn't matter. The disease went airborne. Once it spread, they couldn't stop it. How long were you out there on your own? I don't know. Seven, maybe eight months. Has there been anyone else? Once this thing has its teeth in you- - There are others out there. What others? How do you know? Here, check this out. Can't reach anyone, but we have heard from others. What do they say? Different things, pleas for help, last words. People trying to reach out to whoever they can before the end. There have been other messages too. About a place of hope and salvation. What place? They call it Eden. It's a tall tale. Delusions of desperate people. I've seen it out there. The word Eden. What is it? A colony. A new civilization. People are coming together to rebuild what was lost. It's a pipe dream. That's all it is. Wishful thinking. People are scattered. They're lost. No better than us. Excuse me. Eden is real. Sometimes I think he just wants us to stay here and act like nothing has changed. What are you doing with that? Maybe I can fix it. We've tried. We can't find all the components we need to fix it. I'll give it a try. And if I can fix it, we can find it. What if there's no one left to hear us? At least we tried. Hope is a funny thing. How are we today? Good enough to drink margaritas while we lie in the sun. We will, soon. Everything you know, everything you've ever believed could be gone forever. But for one brief moment, it can all come back and you can believe again. Home sweet home, huh? Do you remember the last time we came up here? You were a kid. We both were. It looks like we're gonna have to clean up a bit before mom and dad get here. Yeah, I'll get right on that. Come on, help me unpack. What if they can't make it? They said they found a way. The blockades, the quarantine, I mean they're so far. How can they get through all that? They'll make it. They'll find a way. You just gotta believe that, man. And when they do, they're gonna have a lot of stuff with 'em. So we better get this place ready. I guess we gotta clean up for real, huh? Yeah. Yeah, we should probably clean up a bit. You know, maybe we could just leave it, right? Give mom something to do when she gets here, keep her busy. Yeah. Mom's really gonna appreciate that. Clean something. Right. Right. Be careful around him, Rosie. I'm not sure we can trust him yet. He hasn't given us a reason not to. Well, he tried to stab me. Well, he was probably suffering from heat stroke. Rosie, he tried to stab me. Yeah, I've thought about doing that myself a couple of times. Okay. Just be careful. When are you going back out there? Well, I think we're pretty well stocked right now. Why? Is there anything you need? No. I'm thinking that we could help him. I'll get back out there in a few days. Maybe I can find some supplies for the radio. - I know, he- - That's not what I meant. I know what you meant, Rosie. Look, my priority is to make sure that you, me and your mother are safe. We're going to need more supplies if we're gonna get out of here before winter. Dad, mom is not gonna be able to- - We can make it. The three of us. And where would you have us go? Why, paradise, of course. Okay. Do me a favor. Speak with your mother. She misses you. It really is the end, isn't it? How are we gonna find our way home, Rory? Morning. Hey. What are you doing? I thought I'd say good morning to her. Breakfast? Sure. What's it like out there? Deserted. Quiet. And you saw the blockades? Yeah. Are they as massive as they say? Walls built out of cars that were burnt by thousands, maybe millions of drums of oil and gasoline. Yeah. They were pretty big. How did you get out? We ran. My dad, he tried to tell us how bad it was. We had no idea. Where representatives are expected to vote on more extreme measures to combat this ongoing threat. - Some of the... - It can't be that bad. Look at me. We have to move, right now. Pack as much as you can carry. And once you're done, help your brother. Still, as leaders search for solutions... We'll figure this out, right? We're gonna be fine, aren't we? Yeah, yeah. I just need to know the two of you are safe. Angelos has more, as she speaks with one of the followers - of these so called 11th. - Go help your brother. We are all but one. Okay. And would you like to send a message to the folks at home? What would you like to say to them? We're chosen, chosen to end. We're branded and we cannot ignore the signs. We thought we could just hide out in the woods and wait for it to blow over. There's no hiding from this, not from any of it. Before my mom got sick, we would fight about everything. My dad and her were always worried about finances. My education, all the things that seemed important at the time. I wish we could go back and have a few more hours with her, where we didn't fight because we were so stubborn. I wish we could say all things we should've said. Maybe you still can. No. All that's left is to say goodbye. - This you? - Yeah. You were a cute kid. Thanks. Remember the last time you'd fart in a crowded room and just hoped no one would know it was you? My mom. She looks really happy. Yeah, we were. I really miss her. I just can't. So, you wanna watch TV? - TV? - Yeah. There's no cable. Okay. All right. Do you have any movies, Blu-ray, DVD, VHS, Betamax, laser disk? - DVDs. - DVDs, okay. Well, let's watch a DVD. I got some popcorn in my bag. It might be a little stale, but what isn't these days? Okay, sure. Why not? DVDs. Hey, stranger. We should be getting back. Why? It's so beautiful out here. Already? We can't take that risk. Come on, let's go. Hey, can we just take a trip into town? I mean, if we're in a safe zone, it should be all right, yeah. I told mom and dad we're staying near the cabin. That's what we're gonna do. What are we even running from? I mean, what if they figured it out at this point? What is it? Oh, shit. What do we do? Holy shit! Head back to the cabin. What? We're just gonna leave him here? We have to. No, I'm not leaving him like this, Rory. He might be infected. We have no choice. We have to leave him. No, we should bury him. That's the least we can do. Why? Who is he? What does he matter? It doesn't matter, okay. I don't care who he is. I don't know who he is. He's a person. It doesn't matter who he is or what he did. Fuck it all. If the world's really coming to an end, I'm not gonna lose my humanity with it. Okay? Give me a hand. What is that? A wound. From a knife. An arrow maybe. Tracks. Come from over here. He wasn't alone. How do you know? Footprints. They're all different. It's like he was hunted. I need your help. Meet me downstairs in a minute. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. Why? You seem like something spooked you. No, no, I was someplace else. Okay. It's right over here. All right, see if you can see something we can use. I thought maybe I can use these tools to start a garden. Why? Winter's coming. Hoping to be on the move before then. You three are leavin'? Yeah, once Lily's well enough. Heading south? Someplace warm? That's the plan. Well, maybe you can use this. Help you find a good spot. What about you, Rory? What are your plans? I don't know. I'll figure something out though. I always do. You know, Rosie really believes in this Eden place. She thinks of it as something bigger than us. Maybe it is. You've heard that static on the two-way radio. Ever since we told you about it, you've been looking hard, trying to find something. I respect that. What's best for us as a family is if we go down south. You can understand that, right? Maybe you can come with us. We can find a spot in the Keys, make our own rum, live off the sea. That sounds great. I know that Rosie would be glad to have a friend. Hey, Casper. What do you think about this? Let's take it. Throw it in the wheelbarrow. All right, can I look? Yes. Boo! What is this? It's a Halloween party. It's Halloween? Well, it could be. - Why not? - Sure. I got this for you. Try it on. I'm gonna go check in on your mother. Was this your idea? - No. - Okay. Didn't think so. It's beautiful. You're a beautiful butterfly. Thank you. Drink? Please. I have some honey. So you are a bear? Is it November already? The holidays are right around the corner. I'll be sure to make a Christmas list. Don't get ahead of yourself. I'm still gonna have to catch us a turkey if we're gonna have Thanksgiving dinner this year. I'm tired. I'll let you get some sleep. Casper. Yeah. Have a good time. I'll take them trick or treating. Always. This is the kind of stuff I wanna make on the beach. - For you. - Thank you. For you. Alright, here's to humanity. One, two, three. Oh, that's bold. Yeah, man. Tastes like magic. Is that okay, Rosie? I've been saving these for a special occasion. So why not post plague Halloween? How long have you had these? Long enough? It's time to taste the myth. The boy in a bear costume. The boy in a... Butterfly girl. It's not alliteration. Hey, to Rory. It's good to meet you. Thank you for gracing us in our... Thanks, Rory. To the best people I know in the world. To the only people you know. Cheers. Cheers. It's delicious. You wanted to be- - I was a scared child. I know. You were not a scared child. I would be scared. Yeah. You wouldn't be scared. After I wanted everybody. Well, here you are. One of only few people left in the world. Remember the first time me and mom took you trick or treating? And I cried because I was so scared. And you were dressed like a skeleton. That thing was so scary. Hey, guys. Say, cheese. Uno. Dos. Tres. Cheese! Oh, you're last. Drink! Drink, drink. Drink it. You know, when I was a kid, we just drank. We didn't need a reason or a game. Just drink, come on. Look at me. Drinking games with my 22 year old daughter. What's this world come to? Guys, I'm out. - Oh, are you sure? You're really good at it. Yeah. I just wanna watch you guys play. I'm enjoying it. So many cards left. You want another one? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Roman Lee, in search of Eden. Please respond. I repeat, this is Roman Lee, in search of Eden. Please respond. Hello. Hello, come on. We can hear you. We hear you. Please respond, over. - You're not alone. - What is it? You're not alone, we're here. This is Eden. We copy, Roman Lee. Hello, Eden. Roman Lee, in search of Eden, please respond ASAP. Repeat, Roman Lee. Eden responds. 46178601829. What does that mean. I need something to write with. Write it down. We repeat, Eden response. 46178601829. We're bringing you home, man. That's it. They're gone. These numbers, what are they? It's like a code, sort of an encrypted... It's coordinates. Here. Here, it has to be here. Why? How do you know that? These are just numbers. It's the most viable option. No, no, no, no. That's north. We can't go north. It'll be too cold. The cold will kill us. I'll go at it alone. No! No, you won't. I'm sorry, but I have to know what's there. So do I. Rosie! What about your mother? She's getting better. No, she's not. She's not getting better. I know you wanna believe that, but dad... - No. - This is our only shot. It's right here. I can almost touch it. No, we are staying here for a few more months and then we're going south. South is our best chance. South is our best chance, Rosie. This is our best chance to live, and I need to live. I need to know there's more out there. What about the life that I've built for us here? What about it? Is that not good enough for you? - Casper. - Shut up! Rosie, is that not good enough? No, it's not. I refuse! I'm not gonna lose you! I'm not gonna lose her! Casper. Casper, come in here. I'm losing it, man. I gotta know what the hell's going on out there. Relax. I can't. I gotta know what's out there. What do you want me to do, Chris? We can't go back out there again. That body we found, there are more, a lot more. There's gotta be some way to know. Our cell phones have been out of commission since we left home. What can we do? Any luck? I found a pack of playing cards. We'll keep looking. Find anything? Yeah, an old notebook. Must be one of dad's old journals. Oh, what does it say? Nothing. The pages are blank. I got it. Turn it on, man. The dial's busted? No. At least we have music now. No. You gotta pump up my jam, son. Come on. Oh, come on. That's no fun. Come back. Come dance with your brother. It's not weird at all. Nothing wrong with it. Gotta feel the move. Shake the beat! Gonna be a good time. You sure? All right. I'll have a party myself. It's a small house, Casper. We don't have secrets here. The walls are too thin. It's time. You know that. I'm not leaving you. No. Oh no. I'm leaving you, my love. I'm living in a borrowed time. And before I go, I need to know that you and Rosie are gonna be okay without me. Yes. You must be that young man that's making our Rosie so happy these past months. You stumbled into our lives and you've changed everything. Please, take care of them. Make sure they're safe. Go. Find this place. What about you? Let me go. You know we'll meet again. If we do this, can you promise you can find it? I can find it. We'll make it. I'm so sorry. I should have come earlier. It is okay. We have a lot to talk about. I know. We're gonna put off making that rum. I guess so. Thank you. My girls. I knew this day would come for so long. Now that it's here... You're never prepared for something like this. At least I got to say goodbye. You got to say more than that. You got back those hours that you wish you had together. So that's something. Yeah, it is. Goodbye, my dear. We should probably get going, if we want to find a water source before sundown. Where are we? Used to be a small town here. This is what happens after years of neglect. One day, the world's greatest cities are gonna resemble this. Yeah. Everything falls apart eventually. It's sad. It's life, Rosie. Where's the skillet? There should be one in my bag. Where did you get this stuff? What? These things... Where did you get it? Some of it is from my home, the cabin and some other stuff like that camera, I found. Where? This abandoned house. There was something in there. In the laundry room, I couldn't bring myself to look inside. When my dad found you, where were you going? Were you looking for something? I don't know. I was just surviving. That's all I thought I knew how to do anymore. Just wandering in hidden places, nowhere else to go. If only you knew what you'd find. Well, if I knew I'd find you, I might have gone the other way. Rory, that's not nice. Sorry. It was a bad joke. That thing you told me about the knife, I know things were hard on you before you found us. You should know that there's more to this than just surviving. Even if we don't find Eden, maybe we were chosen for a reason. And just surviving isn't enough. Before I met you and Casper, I thought I was alone. I'd never speak to anyone ever again. Solitude was all I thought I had left, but you changed that. Hey. Filled those up. Rory, how far we get today? Ah, 20, 30 miles maybe. It's pretty good for first day. We can do better tomorrow, I think. How do you think she's holding up? She seems fine. What about you? - Ask me tomorrow. Maybe I'll tell you. Hey, we got a saucepan in this? I got one. All right, that's yours, hurry. Let's make some dinner. You wanna make it? What, we're doing some brioche? Mm-hmm, chef Rory. Get used to it. Maybe I'll make a nice flan. I don't think you know how. I'm not sure. All right, beans it is. Shit! What's so funny? You want some ice for that, baby? This message has been initiated by National Alert and Warning Authority, in coordination with emergency alert system participants, including broadcast, cable, satellite and wire line participants in your area. My fellow Americans, I address you tonight in a time of great tragedy. Our country, our world, faces an unprecedented epidemic. We face an enemy now, a disease that has spread so fast, caused so much panic and killed like a ruthless predator. It is our darkest hour, but we must not lose hope, because we will fight. Right now, our brightest minds are working around the clock to find the answers, to find light in the darkness. We will find a way to win this war. However, we must take precautions to maintain our safety. I have declared martial law on a federal level. A curfew is now in effect, and we are under quarantine. Do not leave your homes, do not panic, and avoid contact with anyone who has been infected at all costs. This plague is silent and swift. It kills instantly and with remarkable precision. It is imperative that every one stays inside unless absolutely necessary. Together, we can survive this. And all I ask is for you to trust in your government, and we will- - Your turn. Seriously? Again? - Sorry. - Damn! Slow reaction time. ♪ The Lord, he sends 11 ends ♪ ♪ 11th comes to end your pain ♪ ♪ 11 deaths for foe and friend ♪ ♪ 11 deaths to bring our end ♪ ♪ The Lord, he sends 11 ends ♪ ♪ 11 deaths for foe and friend ♪ ♪ The first 10 plagues from bible days ♪ ♪ The last it kills those who remain ♪ Sh! I can't wait to get this food. Hey, I think we got something. Check the cabin. It's a wood cabin. We can burn it down. If there are people in there, they'd die. Meat. You need therapy. Talk to me, Hank. There ain't nothing in there, except a bunch of boxes. Here. Go fish. Come on that buck's around here. It's about day break. I wanna get breakfast. We have to stay here. Morning. It's weird. What? The silence. I miss the sounds of the city. When you dream, do you still see things as they were? When I dream, if I dream, I try to forget it soon after. There's nothing useful about seeing the world as it was through closed eyes. Look. I know that this is something you believe in. I'm trying. My dreams don't matter to me. I believe in yours. We should probably keep going into the hills for a few more hours. Find a good spot, get some firewood, set up camp. You do realize it's gonna start getting cold soon? Yeah. We'll make do though. We'll use whatever we can to stay warm. It's not too late. You can still go back. No, she needs to know. We all do. Come on, let's make up some ground. Rory! What are you doing? Come on! - Come on. - No, go. Go. Hide. Run. I'm buying us some time. Do you think we can make it? We'll make it. We'll find a way. You just gotta believe that. That body we found, there are more. A lot more. Those hunters, they could just be the beginning. We weren't meant for this world. Dad. You found me. Come on. Let's put more distance between us and them before it gets dark. Who were they? I thought they were gone. I saw this symbol, a long time ago. The 11th. They're religious fanatics. What are you talking about? They were a cult. After the plague went global, they believed they were destined to cleanse for world. Cleanse it of what? Everyone. Come on. I think we have to go this way. Can we stop for a minute? Okay with me. I'm gonna walk ahead a bit and see what it looks like. Careful. I'll be fine. You all right? What you did, what you had to do, thank you. So, was there anyone special in your life? Are you asking if I had a girlfriend? That's a weird way to put it. No. Never really had time for that. You never had time? What were you so busy with? I was working retail at the mall. And you didn't have time for anyone? Between that and law school... Law school. Wow, you were gonna be a lawyer. Almost. If I'm honest though, my heart was never really in it. Chris, now that was a man with a plan. He was a talent. Top of his class. He wanted to go pre-med, save lives. I mean, you must really miss him. We used to go on these camping trips. This one time, we got lost just me and him. We were out there for days. But we made it together. My father, he found us and he was going crazy. He probably thought we were dead. We were great. He gave me this just in case we ever got lost again. It helped me guide our way home. True north. Shit! What? Rory! I wonder what that's about. Go check. Oh, I don't want to. I'm coming. So now what? I don't know. We can't just stay here? We need to make a decision. You need to figure this out. You didn't see this? All those maps you followed? You didn't see a river anywhere? After the attack, we got so turned around. I must have missed it. You led us here. My life, my daughter's life are in your hands. Fix this. I don't know how. I'm sorry. I lost my wife, my life, everything I know. It's all gone. I was gonna head down south and maybe live quietly, I don't know. Die peacefully. But we made a choice together. It can't all be for nothing. We are gonna get across that river. We have to. Now, you and Rosie may believe in some Eden, but I don't. I believe in her, and I believed in you. Don't make me regret that. They're out there, man. We can't just sit here. Yeah, well, that's what we're gonna do. They should be here. We have to find them. They could be out there stranded and alone. We're gonna wait here. Just wake the fuck up, man. The world is falling apart. We can't just leave them out there. We could be their last chance. You need to face reality. - Don't you fucking say it. - We're staying. We can't go back out there again, it's not safe. I'm not gonna abandon them. Wake up! They're gone, Chris. No, they are not and I'm gonna find them. There has to be another way. We already talked about this. We can't go around, it'll take too long. And with them out there, we can't take a chance. Okay. Look, you're gonna be fine. We're gonna find your Eden. What about those hunters? What if they find you? Huh? What then? Hey, I'm not letting you go out there. You're my responsibility. - Get off me. - No. I'm sorry. I shouldn't- - I have to go. I have to. We could be their last chance. Mom's lucky scarf. I gave it to her on our first date. Thank you. For what? For this. For believing in me. Always. We don't know what's out there, what's changed. Those hunters, they could just be the beginning. They're our parents. I couldn't live with myself if I didn't at least try. I know. I'll help you. Okay, come on. Rory, help... You all right? Yeah. It wasn't so bad. We made it. Yeah, you want some water? Dad. Hurry up, slow poke. We don't got all day. What, are we cracking jokes now? I'll see you on the other side. It wasn't that bad. You want some water, you know for drinking? Please. - Water, not rum. - Okay. Casper! Come with me. I can't. One of us should stay here just in case they make it back. You're sure about this? Just go two, three miles down the road. And if there's no sign, I'll turn right back. You're all set. Be careful, all right? Don't worry. I'm just going for a walk. Here. Take this with you. It's loaded. Tear your place up a bit? Yeah, bring back some Chinese. Some moo shu, some pork dumplings. No MSG. - No. - None of that. Forget that, no. Just the good stuff. Oh yeah, I'm sure they got plenty that is still around. I'll do my best. The river flows the time. And fast-forward, a day becomes a week, which becomes a month. We inch along its banks, slowed by the cold emptiness of winter. We're lost. Our maps, only blurred lines on faded paper. I've failed him. How do I live with that? Casper. My brother. My father. Lily. I've failed 'em all. Goodbye, my dear. What's best for us as a family is if we go down south. You can understand that, right? We're gonna have to put off making that rum. I guess so. I deserve to be haunted by their memory. Rosie. She's stronger than me. She sits by that river day after day. Remembering her father, her mother, her purpose. And I fear I'll fail her too. Maybe this is our Eden. Our last hope. Or maybe, maybe this is our end. At least we have each other. What happened to your brother? How did he die? I never should've let him go. Where was he going? My parents, they never made it to the cabin. So he decided to go looking for them on the roads to see if they were stranded. Oh, fuck. Stay back, man. Stay there. Okay? I just need some water. I'm asking you please, stay. I just need some water. Stay there. He shot this guy I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm so sorry. Shit! Fuck! Fuck! He was a hunter. A monster. One of the 11th? He told you all of this? No. There was a note. Chris? Chris. I'm sorry. Chris, no! Dammit! Fuck! He was already dead. There was nothing I could do to stop it. He took his life to save yours. His note, his will, it's all I have left of him. He wrote, that he'd tell my parents that I love 'em. What's in the notebook? Time. I've been writing in this since the day he left. Just writing, marking the day. I never thought I'd get this far. I've been using this as a bookmark. His letter. Maybe we need to let go, forgive ourselves. For better or for worse, you're all I have now. I'm all you have. My dad, your brother, they gave us a chance to live. Let's make sure they didn't die for nothing. I saw a picture in the house, of a place like this. It was your parents. Looked like their wedding day. I wish you could've seen it. I thought they would renew their vows, so I can see my mother in her wedding dress. She was so beautiful. I wish I could've known her better. She liked you. You have a drive, a purpose. She always wanted me to have a plan, sense of direction. My dad was actually the laid back one, before all of this. He used to take me to the movies on the weekends when I was a kid. And he'd buy this huge tub of popcorn and a soda. And then after the movie, we'd just spent hours playing arcade games. He acted like it was some big secret. Like my mom didn't know, but she totally knew. They're together now. I know they're so happy. They deserve that. Yeah, they do. When my brother and I got lost as kids, I told him it'd be okay. If we follow the bread crumbs, we'd find our way home. There was this old tree. After my brother died, I'd just go there every day and I'd mark it up. Like a little tally. I went there day after day, and I never saw it. Saw what? My mother used to say the home isn't a place but the people in your life. She said it's a sense of belonging. A sense of purpose. And that's what we carry with us. Home is that sense of belonging, that purpose that we get from those people and those places. That... That's what makes us whole. Home. - That way? - That way. He knew. He knew I'd have to find my way back. Feels like deja vu, doesn't it? I mean, just like we're kids again. I took some of dad's good scotch for the trip. You want some? Yeah. Why not? That's smooth. Yeah, well, might be the last time we get drinks on so good. Why? I mean, if the world is really coming to an end, you know, we'll have all the scotch left for us, and it only gets better with age. What you close it for? I thought you had enough. You know, I was scared shitless. What are you talking about? When we got lost on that camping trip as kids, they were looking for us for like three days and I was terrified the whole time. You seemed fine. Oh yeah, I was hiding it. I couldn't let you know. I mean, you'd never let me live it down. Can I tell you a secret? Yeah, sure. I was scared. I was really fucking scared. But, if you're not scared, you're not really living, right? Amen. You know, I love you, man. I just want you to know that. I love you too, bud. Even if you're a colossal pussy. Thanks, asshole. Still better than a pussy like yourself. We gots to go. Come on. Woo! Where to begin. I'm finally home. Because of her. Hello, down there. It's okay. It's okay. I'm just a weary traveler just like yourselves. What brings you here? I'm who you've been searching for. I know a place. It's where I'm from. There's peace there. We call it... Eden. We found it. It's real. It's real. It's real. If it's Eden you seek, I can take you there. Are you afraid? Yes. The world is new. We've all suffered and been through so much, but we've survived. I guess this the beginning now. A new lease on life. We've survived so we can finally have another chance to live. Here we are the lucky few.
