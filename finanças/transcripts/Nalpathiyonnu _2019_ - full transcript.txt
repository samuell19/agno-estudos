Tell him Go Maashe But we have done our makeup How can you cancel it now? There is no change in my decision Do you want to dance when a man is seriously injured? But it's your party member who attacked him You are crossing your limits Ullaas maashe Sorry maashe Maashe Come Maashe, it has been decided that the lad will not be handed over to police Then? Vaavaachi Kannan hit maashu with the school's bell hammer He did it in school today Who knows what he will do tomorrow Maashe, if we hand him over to the police they will beat him to pulp You just follow what he says That's the right thing to do Maashe, let's discuss the matter Maashe, stop there God as... God as businessman - My fees - Why so early? So that you can't say I'm late Will you allow your son to burn my pyre? I had dreamed of confessing my love to you (poetry class) But never once could I tell you, my love (giggling) - Silence - I know indeed... (poetry class) you want me to speak (poetry class) I would like to clarify something Men and women get attracted to each other because of a natural phenomenon At your age hormone production is quite high - Hence such tendencies are also greater - Maashe, I... Sit down However one should try to send rational messages to the brain and control such foolish thoughts Otherwise you can discontinue your studies here Am I clear? - Maashe - Yes If you had to say something to me why not say it personally? Why did you tell the whole class? What do you think? That C.S. Ullaaskumar is like the others I don't know about the others But... Bhagyasuyam You will... Tomorrow I would like to see your father before class Maashe You wanted to see my father about our wedding, right? Here he is Maashu wants to meet my father Bhagyakuri (nickname), call your father I will talk to him Comrade Abu you don't know what the matter is I already know what it's all about You know I have four kids What are you up to? Don't worry, maashe I swear I didn't tell achan about us What about us? You know what Why don't you look at me when you take classes? I... There are so many tea stalls here Why do you visit Dineshan's tea stall every Saturday? That too at the same time I go to temple? - Do you want more? - Good job Leave this to me now Anyway I wanted to meet Kuttan aashaari Why should you meet him? Because I need to, maashe I will present it before the right committee discuss it in stages arrive at a rational decision and inform you of the date and time Until then you can play this teacher-student game Long live the revolution I will teach you a lesson Lazing over boughs of clouds Patting streaks of lightning Pitter patter Like pots cracking The season brings its virgin drops The lone jasmine flower in my garden Yearns to be home And spread its sweet bane With our eyes closed And our tongues tied We love each other Just so, my friend The scent of frangipani Scatters in the wind As the wintry night restlessly wakes I will take wing And hold you in my arms I will be one with The wind that gently glides Do you see the playful moon Teasing the shadows at night? Do you hear me sing my dear friend? Lazing over boughs of clouds Patting streaks of lightning Pitter patter Like pots cracking The season brings its virgin drops The lone jasmine flower in my garden Yearns to be home And spread its sweet bane With our eyes closed And our tongues tied We love each other Just so, my friend Flowers drape and sway With ripples in the waterway Adding to the splendour Of the first light of day As you greet me at the doorway I can't but embrace you it's only fair, I say Do you see the glow of the new dawn As it bids farewell to the looming night? Do you hear my heart beating my dear friend? - What are you doing? - It's shaky Your head? Lazing over boughs of clouds Patting streaks of lightning Pitter patter Like pots cracking The season brings its virgin drops The lone jasmine flower in my garden Yearns to be home And spread its sweet bane With our eyes closed And our tongues tied We loved each other Just so, my friend Fetch me a stick Yes, a stick For a snake lies in my way Yes, a snake lies in my way Neither elephant yam nor elephant ear A venomous viper I fear Yes, a venomous viper A venomous viper Can you come over here? Ullaas maashu is here to speak with her Karthikeyan master's elder girl Kaathu... (song tapers off) It's better you come before I lose my cool Why didn't you invite him in? I have a few conditions First of all I won't wear a white shirt for my wedding I will wear a blue shirt Is that why you came now, maashe? You can wear whatever you like But please come dressed Do you have any other condition? Bhagyam shouldn't wear a saree You should wear this churidar No, that's not right People will say things if the bride is not in saree Our volunteers will make sure nobody says a word about it We should set an example against customs Who is this sage? He is a philosopher, the guard and guardian of the Kerala rationalist society Owner of Therali publications Mr.Therali Veerali sir Sorry, Veerali sir But my daughter will wear saree for her wedding Amma, I'm okay with it I will wear churidar It's so sad, maashe Why do you place such conditions before us? If she were from your community will you tell her so on wedding eve? - It's not... - No sister, you're mistaken Our time demands that this wedding be held in this manner So it's not your demand? Acha, maashu will have his own plan But his plan is pointless Any other condition? Like the bride's father should wear shorts? We can't have the sacred thread tying ceremony - Oh my Muthappa (a Hindu deity) - Amma Maashe, there are certain customs that we need to follow There will be no sacred thread ceremony or lighting of lamp It's been discussed and finalised It's in the minutes too What if we don't agree to it? Acha We will do as you say, maashe Please leave now Our neighbours are watching What do you mean? Maashe, we maybe from a different community But we are a respectable family I have publicly spoken against such customs If I don't follow them I will have a face to fix Maashe please leave I will talk to my parents - Shall we go? - Okay maashe There are so many able men in our village but she fell for this man It would have been better if you'd run away with him My Muthappa, how will I face the guests? I will hit 75 this April This is the first time that Chekkunnu will witness a wedding of our kind This will be a bolt from the blue for the people of Chekkunnu Let's go Ullaas, your shirt... Is it okay? It's not white, it's blue Yes it's blue But it appears white from a distance Especially in the photos... Sir, we have colour photos now not black and white Exactly Oh no what's this? Sarojini aunty What is she wearing? - Take Sathyan uncle's blessing - May Muthappan bless you What is she wearing? Garland, betel leaf, coconut flower - Hey, where is the lamp? - I don't know - Pangan uncle - Kuttan, have you forgotten our customs? Or did you invite us so that you can mock them before us? Pangan uncle, we wanted to set an example to others Pangan uncle, we... This is what the bridegroom's party wanted If you are doing everything their way then why did you invite us? They can be the only guests Can't you light a lamp so that the sacred thread can be tied with fire as witness? Hey Appu, bring the lamp and light it up Let's see what will happen Uncle, let's not do it Why not? We should have avoided traditional music This marriage calls for some exciting music What are you wearing? You managed to hijack maashu, right? Maashe, you would look hip with a pair of sunglasses - You are a joke, maashe - Ullaas What is that? Who gave you permission to light a lamp? I asked myself before I lighted the lamp I'm Kuttan's only uncle Do you have a problem with it? Hey get rid of that lamp I swear by Muthappan if you dare touch my lamp there will be a bloodbath Then I will also shed some blood Take care of him Why are you after me? Maashe please don't Stay away you fake Maashe Acha Stop it - Acha - Oh my God You should have told me that you were not interested in me Why humiliate me like this? Bhagyam, we had decided that we won't have a lamp Are you with these people? I dressed up in this way for you It's just a lamp, maashe Can't you do this for me? I realise it now Great men like you should never marry silly girls like me Nobody has to put up with it for my sake Acha I don't want to get married, acha My poor child Don't worry, Ullaaskumar I will marry my daughter to you - (curses) - Sister How dare you after breaking off my son's wedding Come with me You come dressed up like a clown You will have to pay for that girl's tears Those who took tickets to Caltex come forward Get down Chechi, make it quick Get in Close that door Let's go Come, have your fill Kanna Kanna The water supply has been disrupted for two days - Hey Kanna - Yes We have tools and stuff there You just come with me - Wait man - Hello little girl Bhagavathy...

I'm afraid he might say something to annoy the police That's true If he talks, the police will thrash him even if they don't want to do it Please maashe Let comrade make the call Last time the police caught him they beat him to a pulp Now he is always sick He even takes medicine every night No comrade We can't indulge him anymore Let him remain locked up for a day Don't interfere, comrade My dear maashe, stop saying that Suma, think logically He knows that we will help him That's why he is always getting himself into trouble It's better he remains in jail at least until his head is clear Hello Chekkunnu station You will see sir smiling at me now I was wondering why you hadn't called - See that - I'll release him right now No, you don't have to come Hey get up He is sitting on my lungi (in Hindi) It's my party (in Hindi) So what? - Hey Suresh - Yes, sir Who is Seethisahib's help Buddhadeb? - He is sitting on the floor - (in Hindi) That's me, sir - Buddhadeb? - (in Hindi) Yes sir (in Hindi) You can go home (in Hindi) Thank you, sir Nobody will call about your release They don't need you anymore Enhance the colour and length of that bindi Is that enough? - Okay right? - Yes that's good It started with missed calls Then he sent good morning messages to my WhatsApp When I got good night messages I blocked his number Now I don't dare open my Facebook, comrade Would you care to see the photo he sent me last night? What are you saying, chechi? I don't have Facebook I sold my phone with Facebook last month Is Facebook your holy book that you need to recite daily? What is the merit in this complaint? Sujatha, do one thing Write a complaint in this paper and give it at Chekkunnu police station This is cyber case If proven you will be jailed for three years Maashe Suja chechi No matter who did this to you I apologise on his behalf Moreover we have no complaint here I'll make sure that nobody sends any message not even a red salute to your phone Hey you Do you know what the great Lenin said about the importance of morality in a communist's life? - This Lenin is such a pain in the neck - Eh? I said sorry and if you want I can apologise Hoy It's me, Vaavaachi Who wants to put Vaavaachi in jail? Come outside and face me - Who's that shouting? - It's Vaavaachi - He is up to something - Hey Vaavaachi Be off or I'll forget you were a party person - I were a party person? - Why of course? Who the hell are you to decide that? - (men shouting) - He's impossible - Don't cause trouble - Vaavaachi, leave him (several men shouting) - Hey, stop that - Stop - Move aside - Move So Vaavaachi is an outsider now? What do you get by freeing such useless fellows from jail? Kanna, you attacked that policeman because our party is in power Do you know what really happened? - Don't speak without knowing the truth - What truth? You get drunk and ruin the party's reputation Maashe, you... Kanna, back off This man has always had a problem with me Don't you dare listen to him and mess with me I'll be forced to tell a story from the past I'll tell the whole world - How about that? - Just say it then - (men shouting) - Be quiet Maashe, you leave now I need to talk to Kannan Go away, everybody - Maashe, he... - Go You visited him in jail, didn't you? - He went to jail instead of me - Yes, he did You do know that The party protected you because your wife was pregnant But what for? Who loses if you ruin your life drinking? - I lose - No It's my loss It's the party's loss I'm sure you know what is at stake but you don't care Yes, I have killed a man - But not for myself - Then? Did the party ask you to do it? Nobody told me to do it What else could I have done when they hacked Chandrettan before me? I stabbed one of them with what I had And I don't regret it to this day Though... I got away with it my daughter paid for it Kanna The court doesn't know who the culprit is But they know They know it's you Be careful Su... My dearest Su... Come here So this is where you are What brings you here today? (Vaavaachi howls) - Su - Come (mumbles) I tripped over my sandals Kannamma, Kannamma, what's in your dish? Crow's meat, toddy and fish - La la la la la la - Hey Vaavaachi Save your health for our sake We have work to do on it (Vaavaachi hollers) Am I some unfinished house that you want to work on me? Kannetta, stop it Come on if you dare - Come and get me - Kannetta, let's go - Come on - Leave it We are coming to get you Just wait Let's go now Here's black tea They serve puffs everywhere but we still get dal vada - Can we at least change this? - So comrades There is another issue we need to discuss before we leave Our member comrade Remya She saw a strange sight at the temple Tell them yourself Would you care to hear? That Vaavaachi Kannan was lying stark-naked in the temple yard - Fool - He is right The temple committee was about to call the police But I managed to pacify them Then he started swearing at me I felt so insulted He knows that the party will save him no matter what He has started issuing threats Earlier only journalists bothered us Now we have to be wary of trollers and their mobiles They are finding new ways to defame the party - So we should stop helping him - Yes We should expel people like him for the sake of our party - Very true - That's right But we have to discuss it Let's assume that we discussed it It's only a matter of adding four lines to the minutes No I object to expelling him Maashe, don't oppose for the sake of it We know that you don't like him Is it because I suggested it? Is that why you oppose? I don't take a stand based on who says what I had presented the same thing at the same committee many years back At that time everybody pampered him Now you want to get rid of him because he is not useful anymore It is Ravi Nambiar's opinion Not our decision If maashu has a different opinion we will discuss it Why discuss the matter at all? He wasn't so bad earlier But these days he drinks nonstop I think that the party should take charge of reforming him Of course Ullaas maashu himself can take charge You are the right person for the job Maashu, you are the change maker of this village That's fine But reforming a man is the collective duty of a society The society is with you, isn't it? - Certainly - Problem solved However, Ullaas maashu has to lead us So I think that the responsibility of helping comrade Kannan to stop drinking and become a better man should be given to Ullaas maashu - Any objection? - No Let's applaud and approve it I'm with Nambiar on this If there is anyone whom Kannan looks up to in Chekkunnu it's you Take it up as a challenge That family needs your help How to stop alcohol drinking? Ten ways to stop... Maashe, sorry I just wanted to prepare some notes on the way - Don't show your notes to anyone - But... Here is your card Let's go inside Token number 16 You may go in when they call your name Why are you here, amma? You care about others so much I'm growing old too But you don't have time for me You can't go in without a token I managed to get a token with some help Token indeed It's a kind of tumour in the eyes A single surgery won't work it may need two or three What if we do it, doctor? It has to be done so that your child gets to see again Does it need a lot of money? Yes, it's expensive as well as risky But that shouldn't discourage you We should take a chance Think about it My number is in this file so you can call me Okay - Next - Token number 24 - This will be on till 4 pm - Did you hear what doctor said? - Hold this - We will be over there - Shall we go home now? - Suma Suma, wait - I need to talk to you - Yes maashe It's about Vaavaachi He needs to stop drinking Shivankunnu, Shivankunnu Shinkunnu, Shinkunnu Chekkunnu Do you get it? That's how Chekkunnu got its name They called it Shinkunnu instead of Shivankunnu and it became Chekkunnu I realised it when I heard the teacher's speech But my son says that it was called Chekkunnu after Che's visit Che who? Ernesto, our Che Guevara Ernesto Che Guevara Maashe, if you want to help please do as I tell you If so we can get it done without Kannettan's knowledge Can you do it secretly? I'll be in trouble if someone comes to know about it Are you sure? Maashe, it works, that's why You know Shobhanechi's army husband She slyly gave this medicine to him - Really? - He still doesn't know anything about it It's true, maashe I can't travel that far with my little girl Maashe, please buy this when you go to Kannur Suma, drinking is a mental health problem - I've been studying it in detail - Okay Carry on with your study, maashe But for now please buy this And don't tell anybody that I asked you to buy it If Kannettan comes to know it will be of no use It's just a medicine, maashe It will stop with this It will stop as if you turned it off Take my word for it That's the power of Alambu-No Maashe, like you, I believe that there is no God God installed a nerve in our body so that we lose control when we have ethyl alcohol It means he is an agent of liquor lobby From ***** to ****** I have tested all kinds of alcohol on my body to develop this medicine I've cured many great men Give it mixed with rice It's totally odourless So they won't know But it's highly effective So they will throw up everything that they have had And if they throw up it has worked Trust Dr. Kochaniyan Suma Suma Hi little one, it's maashu uncle Where is your amma? Amma went to fetch achan Aren't you afraid of the dark? I have my doll Did I just ask a blind child if she is afraid of the dark? It's such an irrational... I'll give you, move away Hello Hello I'm here at Ravi's place Yes I'm here already - Come soon - (Vaavaachi singing) You give him food and join us Our president is here He wants us to enlist for the show of strength at Thiruvananthapuram tomorrow A show of strength? - How about this? - Kannetta - I wasn't talking to you - Hey you, go home - Get lost - Stop it How dare you insult me, you drunk He has no love for his community Some people think that we are less in number like the lion-tailed macaque Don't we need a medical college? Will we get one if we go to Thiruvananthapuram? Yes we will (Vaavaachi singing) Vaavaachi is home Kannamma, Kannamma, what's in your dish? Crow's meat, toddy and fish - [Vaavaachi] My sandals - Maashu [Vaavaachi] It doesn't fit (Vaavaachi singing) Here's your Vaavaachi Sit here - Acha - (playful sounds) Acha's darling daughter (Vaavaachi's playful sounds) I came to give this to you That woman came when I was about to leave I'm so sorry to have bothered you - How will you... - That's okay Give it to him and put him to bed quickly Shall I tell you about the science behind it? - Please maashe - Alright - Kannetta - (Vaavaachi's playful sounds) That's enough Now quickly wipe yourself Stop it, woman What's the hurry? We are not going to bed so early I'm going to play with my dear daughter for some more time Let's sit under the moonlight tonight - Jenimol... - Moonlight? - Do you see your moonlight now? - Su Hey Su - You will pay for this - Kannetta Sit there Come Get inside - Acha - What's it? - Go inside - Kannetta Come on - You get off - Hey Vaavaachi It's Biju, Eagle Biju Somebody is lying in wait for you here Go check over there - Come on - Over there - I didn't mean to... - Bring him here Ullaas maashu, it's you? Oh my goodness When the president called me I thought it was one of them That's why I came running This is unbelievable, maashe Suma, does maashu visit you at this time everyday? I guess morality doesn't apply to you, maashe Can I explain? Have you no women in your community that you exploit women from ours? Please leave maashu alone I told him to... I knew there was something between you This is what happens when you get drunk and go astray Do you realise it now? Who knows who is the father of this blind girl President, let's go Why hit the president for your wife's mistake? Hit this man if you dare Take your hands off maashu Hands off I'll kill you I'll call when I need moral police in my home Get out Go away Go So you are also part of this deal What does he care? He is only after money so he can drink to his heart's content (people screaming in fright) - Get in and close the door - Not me Please not me He has gone crazy Kanna, please listen to me Maashe, you better leave I'm losing my mind - I don't know what I will do - I don't care Let me tell you what I want to say I don't want to hear anything I know my wife so don't teach me You better leave now Maashe please go away I'll tell Kannettan that you came here to help us Maashe... Maashe Forgive me, maashe Maashe, is it in today's paper? Everybody thought he was a decent man You are lucky you didn't marry him Men who talk big always turn out to be frauds I'm shocked to learn that your friend Suma did this Aren't you ashamed to gossip on an empty stomach? I know maashu and Suma very well The party had given him a task That's why maashu went there It's true that the party assigned him a task But that doesn't answer why he hid in the backyard of the house Whatever it is, people say it is because he is still single It's easy to silence your rival by linking him to a woman Isn't it so? However, Ullaas maashu has given an explanation and it is totally satisfactory So there will be no further enquiry Whether you like it or not everybody in Chekkunnu is talking about it They say that maashu opposed Vaavaachi Kannan's dismissal from the party because of his affair with that woman I won't oppose Kannan's dismissal anymore You can do as you please I will say nothing I have failed in my assignment Besides some of our party friends have taken it the wrong way So I apologise to each and every one Somebody else can take responsibility In that case comrade Ravi can do it I don't have a problem But I will take a different approach - This is an unpolitical move - Yes it is Alcoholism is not a political issue It's a mental health problem - But is this the only way? - Maybe there are other ways This is what I consider best I can convince him to agree to it But you should come with me tomorrow morning We can ask maashu to join us Just for fun Su, tell them I'm not home Tell that I went to work - Kannettan is not here - (hushes) Hey Kanna We saw you scrambling inside Have you started so early? No, I wasn't drinking I went in to change my shirt when I saw you coming Maashe Come in, maashe Get some tea Maashu tried to help you out but you know where it got him Now comrade Ravi is in charge of you Comrade wants to speak to you You should listen to him Not just listen but obey him Two days ago around sunrise I had a dream I was told that you should serve the 41-day penance and go on a pilgrimage to Sabarimala - Who told you? - Who told me? Do you really want to know? I may have deviated from the path But my household has a shrine and Chathan (demigod) worship Don't you know that? So it's better you obey me You will go to Sabarimala following the customs and observing strict penance Our reformation club will bear the expenses No, that won't be necessary Nambiar chetta - That will be inconvenient - For whom? Of course, for me My legs are getting weaker these days How can I climb the steep hill to the temple? I have a better plan I will take medicines and get well this year and make the pilgrimage next year That will do Come here The party watches over you So you are safe What if the party doesn't care? When the party protects you obey what the party members tell you to do for your own good I thought you believed in God That's why I told you about my dream If you ignore this, I fear there will be consequences I will say no more But you, she and your child will suffer None of us will help you - I didn't say that I won't go - Then? I'm ill I don't feel safe going that far all by myself That's why That's it? I can come with you Or you can choose anyone of us Choose any party member you like and he will go with you You have secretary comrade Abu's word Tell us who you want Don't miss this chance because there is nobody to accompany you So? So I have to go? Kanna, 100 percent, yes You will go after serving the 41-day penance There is no way you can get out of it If this is what comrades have decided then I have something to say Say it If so... I... I will go if Ullaas maashu agrees to go with me Imagine you are the driver of a KSRTC (public) bus Just imagine Suppose the bus has a service to Pamba In such a situation will you refuse to drive to Pamba because you are a rationalist? You are going on an excursion with Vaavaachi That's all So my beliefs are not important? You are our most important man now You will defeat him with your humanity, won't you? When a helpless mother and her child suffer due to the serious drinking habit of the father will the benevolent maashu ignore it? He will discard his principles to help them That idiot thinks you won't do it There maybe others who will do it after listening to your lecture But you can't fool me Man is in charge of his life not... Maashe, at least his family will be relieved to see him sober for a few days That's not my problem Well done, Ullaasa Your amma is so happy Hey Do you know when I was a little girl I had taken the vow to go to Sabarimala But I started to menstruate the day before we were to leave So I could never go That curse still haunts our family Anyway we will soon be free of it I know what you are thinking But you can quit daydreaming So you are not going? Don't be so enthusiastic about rumours I can't set aside my principles You go now Keep convincing yourself that you are right Finally you will end up like Therali maashu Metam (Aries) Idavam (Taurus) Mithunam (Gemini) Karkhitakam (Cancer) Therali maashe Hey Ullaasa Wake up Quick She is here - Who? - Bhagyam She is waiting outside When I told her you were sleeping she asked me not to wake you up I asked her to come in but she refused You go, I'll come I came to trouble you further, maashe I know that we have made life difficult for both of you That's okay Anyway I wanted to meet maashu It's good that we met to discuss this matter You know it better, Bhagyasuyam I've never softened my stand on any matter I've had to give up so much because of it What did you lose, maashe? It was others who lost to you Oh no, Bhagyechi Please don't blame anybody I'm badly in need of help That's why I... Maashe Kannettan is not what he seems to be He is not keeping well at all and he has so many medicines It's because of his drinking problem If he observes penance there will be some respite for a few days That's why Maashe, at least for the sake of this child Suma, you can't move him with your tears For him tears are just a fluid with sodium chloride That's all I didn't come here to argue with you I thought it would be great if you could help save somebody's life You can do whatever you like Who am I to tell you?

Swamiye... - (chanting mantra) - Son Look who's here He has taken the vow I wonder if he will turn into the chief priest at Sabarimala It's happened before Remember Srinivasan from the film 'Chinthavishtayaaya Syamala' What if it comes true? What are you smiling at? What are you doing, maashe? Dinesha, there should be only one tea on this table from now on Maashu can't eat or drink anything from outside for 41 days Don't stare at me See maashe A large community of believers is watching every single move You see that? We should not break long-standing customs Customs What customs? Have you seen some leaders who observe 41-day penance and visit Sabarimala every year? They look as if they are just out of a beauty salon They can do whatever they want, maashe When we Communists set out for a task we should do it the right way So follow Nambiar's words You should be a true Ayyappan (refers to a male pilgrim) in the way you walk, talk and dress Yes No no no no say no say no Say no to turning this way or that Say no to scratching your head or back Say no to the no, say no In forty-one days you will be pious Say no to smiles, say no to cries Say no to all things beyond confines No no no no say no say no Say no to turning this way or that Say no to scratching your head or back Say no to the no, say no As words you said come back to haunt you Swallow them, there's nothing you can do My son...

Swamiye... Swamiye... Ayyappo (chanting) - If you go now - (murmurs) It's not a march You can see Swami When you see Swami - (murmurs) What next? - You attain moksha (liberation) - You attain moksha - Save me Appa Ayyappo Maashe, quick the bus is here Swami (refers to a male pilgrim), just one... Swami Maashe, over here I've saved a seat for you - Excuse me - Maashe, take a seat Maashe Maashe come and sit down Maashe it's a long journey Please sit down - Maashe come fast - I can take the seat - Maashu - I don't think he wants to sit Swamiye... Sharanamayyappo (pilgrims chanting mantra) - (pilgrims chanting mantra) - Ticket Have you taken your ticket? Chetta, two tickets to Sabarimala - Where? - Sabarimala - First-timer? - So what? Oh no Does it hurt, maashe? It isn't easy to make me a better man, is it? Thiruvananthapuram super-fast bus via Chalakkudy, Angamaly Vyttila, Cherthala, Alappuzha, Kollam and Attingal is parked on platform 15 Eat quickly, my child The bus is about to leave Do you need anything else? Shall I order tea? - You want anything else? - Two tea - Swamiye... Sharanamayyappa - Give that Swami a glass of water Mohanan Swami, take your time We'll wait outside But we haven't paid... I don't have a penny with me You agreed to bear the expenses Leave a shop without paying, it's not fair Let's just tell them What will you say? Maashe, I can't clean toilets during my penance, just follow me - Swami, aren't you coming? - No Carry on, we'll meet in Sabarimala Goodbye Alright It seems like I set out at the wrong time So you do believe in good times and bad times? - You came for a pilgrimage without money? - Look maashe Is it my fault that you lost the money that the party gave you? What is the next plan? What plan? I can't go to party office to ask for help in this costume Then here's my plan I have a friend who stays nearby We will ask him to lend us some money That won't work Come with me, maashe He will give us money Stop here Come on, maashe Swamiye... Sharanamayyappa Hey, look who's here? O my Vaavaachi... I thought of you, my dear boy while I was praying last night You remember me in your prayers so you can curse me Will God listen to me even if I ask for it? Chetta, just a minute I'll be back now Who is this sage? - Ammachi (granny), this is Ullaas maashu - Ullaas? - Ammachi, please settle that driver - Okay Sebastian maashu - Good gracious, Ullaas maashe - Maashe Vaavaachi, I can't believe my eyes He did tell me that he will bring you here one day But I never thought he had such a thing on his mind I'm sorry I didn't come to see you after you left Chekkunnu It's my fault Why would I need another help from Chekunnu? He is always there for me He visits me every two or three months He has no reservations about the kind of job he will do He does whatever he can Bring it Here is our sweet robusta banana, maashe Straight from the garden He planted it himself so it has to be sweet Maashe Rationalists like you may not believe in it But for believers like us Sabarimala pilgrimage is not just a journey We repay our old debts meet our Gods on the way pray to them, seek their blessings and then go up the hill Maashe Make sure everything is intact Don't blame this Vaavaachi later The seat reservation coupons for the A/C bus to Bangalore via Kozhikode, Sulthan Bathery Gundalpettu, Nenjankodu, Mysore & Mandya can be bought from the enquiry counter Maashe, have you slept? Tell me We don't know if God exists or not You don't know but I know Suppose there is no God, as you believe We lose nothing by believing that there is a greater power Now if at all God exists believing in God will be very useful and those who don't believe will pay the price I think that's why ordinary men can't be rationalists Am I right, maashe? There is no such thing as ordinary men or extraordinary men Basically, every man is a rationalist Imagine it's raining suddenly Most animals seek shelter Some ignore the rain and go their way But what about man? Man with his wisdom invented the umbrella so that he doesn't get wet With an umbrella you can go out and get your job done even if it's raining Vaavaachi One who uses his wisdom to change any situation in his favour is a true rationalist However maashe Who creates such situations that a man uses to his advantage? Isn't it God's work? Ayyappa (Lord Ayyappan) - Chetta, can you stop at Punnapra-Vayalar? - Not possible - There are two of us, if you can... - The bus doesn't stop there I took this long route because I wanted to see it Or we could have gone via M.C. Road - Maashe, take this, quick - They won't stop here Just listen to me Step aside, maashe Oh gosh, I want to pee Please stop the bus Stop or I will pee in the bus I rang the bell Driver sir please stop the bus I will pee right now Come on Saayippe (slang for white male), you want to pee? Come on maashe, get off the bus Get down Let's go maashe The wind here still has the scent of the revolution Maashe, you go on and greet the martyrs I will get a soda - A glass of water - I don't sell water Then give me a soda Now give me a glass of water Here it is (Punnapra-Vayalar Uprising Martyrs' Memorial) Oh my God How do we go from here? Since we are here we could visit the nearby Ambalappuzha temple There... Ambalappuzha pal payasam (sacred food)... We... there... Since... it's a long journey... Maashe... we can have some... long journey... Maashe Maashe It was a mistake, maashe I didn't drink all these days I won't do it again Maashe, I swear on Jenimol I didn't have a single drop for 41 days - Trust me, maashe - Stop it, you Here I'm making a fool of myself for your sake and you... Maashe This is the end of it all I'm going back - Maashe - Get lost Maashe - Ayyappo... Swamiye (pilgrims chanting) - Maashe (pilgrims chanting) - (pilgrims chanting) - Maashe, don't go - Maashe, just listen to me - (pilgrims chanting) - Maashe, please don't go - (pilgrims chanting) - Maashe, let me explain - Leave me alone - What the hell are you doing? - Maashe stop - Maashe, don't go - Hey you - Maashe, I won't do it again - I'll give you a whack Comrade How can you do that, maashe? How can you change your decision without asking the people who gave you this responsibility? I'm not surprised You are in the habit of running away from your responsibilities What do you want me to do, comrade? You are asking me? Give it to me Maashe You have to be more responsible Don't you know that his enemies are waiting for an opportunity? Besides, has he ever travelled far from Chekkunnu? You have walked out on a crazy fellow Maashe If at all something happens to him you will be answerable Mark my words Chetta, here - Are you here for your friend? - Yes He deserves a solid whack I let him go because he is a Swami You would be killed if you fell off the bus You are lucky I was already calling up for an ambulance This one is for your good luck Have you seen him around since? I pulled him away before he was run over by the bus He said he didn't have money to go to Sabarimala I told him that he could travel for free with a group from Ambalappuzha So that's why he was hurrying to the Ambalappuzha temple - Hello - Okay then You are a strange guy You travelled with him all these days And you don't have his number? Oh yes, you were unhappy about the trip from the start Alright I will send his number right now But you have to find him Or you can forget about returning home Hello - Hey Kanna - Who is this? - Isn't this Kannan's number? - Yes but who are you I'm... C.S. Ullaaskumar Is it you, Ullaas maashu? Maashe, it's me Sebu Sebastian Yesterday just before you left he gave this phone to me I refused to take it but he insisted He told me a friend gave it to him on returning from the Gulf He feared that if he kept it he would lose it somewhere But where are you guys now? What about our good man? He is with me Hello can you hear me? I can't hear you because of the fireworks - Hello - Hello Hello Swamiye... Sharanamayyappa (pilgrims chanting) Hariharasuthane... Sharanamayyappa (pilgrims chanting) The Ambalappuzha group goes to Erumeli to perform Pettathullal (a ritualistic dance) But before they begin the dance another group starts from here Just like Swami said I saw a man rushing towards the vehicle from the western side He got in just before it left Swami, you should go straight to Erumeli from here That's better Those who went from here go there to watch Ambalappuzha group's Pettathullal Only then they climb the hills Swami Sharanam (pilgrim chanting) Swami Swami We are in Pathanamthitta This is the last stop He is a troublemaker But now that he is not with me... That's the thing, sir When he is not with you you miss him When you search for him you hope that you will meet him somewhere soon That's what believing in God is about When you are all alone simply believe that somebody who can't be seen is with you And hope that something good will happen That's all Swami let's go - Shall we go? - Yeah My irumudikkettu... I hope you didn't have a hard time finding me Sir - Get in - Swami Sharanam What's the matter, sir? - Are you with him? - Yes - Then you can join him, go on - But sir... What's the matter? Sir, he is... Get up If you feel like tearing up your clothes or slapping your own cheeks you may please carry on We have installed cameras everywhere Mr. S.I. on what grounds are you... Who's this newbie? I'm C.S. Ullaaskumar That means I'm the author of the popular book 'God as a businessman' So you do business with God? Do you believe in God? I'm not... Sir, he is Ullaas Swami a well-known Ayyappa devotee We just met at the bus stand That's all He is not a part of my gang Ullaas Swami and I have never met each other before today - Hey - Sir Get a copy of Ullaas Swami's ID card Go with him Come on Swami Sharanam Comrades - Dear friends - Swami Say Swami Sharanam first - Friends indeed - Swami Sharanam Attention Comrade K.T. Kannan of Puthiyangu Lakshamveedu in Chekkunnu village of Kannur district Friend and guide C.S. Ullaaskumar is waiting for you at the counter I request Comrade Kannan to take this as a notice and present himself at the counter immediately If not Chekkunnu LC (local committee) will be officially informed and prompted to take strong action Appa (father), I'm here, appa - Hello - Hello (woman's voice) Hello - I had black tea - It's Rs. 20 Why are you paying for one? What about our Vaavaachi? Don't forget that he is an Ayyappan Swami thinthakathomthom Ayyappathinthakathomthom (devotional song) Swami thinthakathomthom Ayyappathinthakathomthom Maashe Maashe Maashe (murmurs) Kanna Hey Hey Kanna Kanna Maashe When you finally found him he is flat on his back Do you realise now that if you seek you will find? You know sir was so worried when you went missing Sir, I'm no hardened criminal But I had blown up a police station in the past, that's it Even we had a red flag But it was the colour of blood We were so young then The police were after us and I was tired of running away So I wore a black mundu and climbed the hill Since then I have been to Sabarimala every year Now I'm a periyaswami (senior pilgrim) However, the police often come and ask questions Maybe to kill time You should wash your sins away in River Pampa before going up the hill Ayyanayyanayyan (Lord Ayyappan) Ayyanayyanayyan Ayyanayyanayyan Ayyanayyanayyan Your ego wanes Your notion of other fades Into the infinite ocean of divinity Everything is within you Everything is within I This is the Supreme Truth This is the meaning you seek See the invisible Beyond what eyes can see See the manifest Beyond what eyes can believe Ayyanayyanayyan Ayyanayyanayyan The whole universe is nothing But a dance of illusion Though time like a serpent bites into life You seek sustenance to keep alive Like travellers at the wayside inn Who turn keepers and reign You rest your head on a deadly snake tonight And dream of the money you will earn in daylight You caress the myth of self As death dances on your shoulder No one will come again No one will douse the flames As you feed the fire and ashen the pyre Ayyanayyanayyan Ayyanayyanayyan Ayyanayyanayyan Ayyanayyanayyan Ayyanayyanayyan Ayyanayyanayyan The whole universe is nothing But a dance of illusion You should not climb the hill carrying arms Not even a small piece of iron Your mind should be without fear when you go up Let no man know misery or pain This is the quest to lifeâ€™s purpose Let every man see God in everyone This is the path to realising the true self Let your mind be free of the folly of caste While you go up to the unknown Let your mind recall the oneness of life While you go down to the known Though you stand divided in the world You are bound by one thread in the soul You are nothing on your own You are not absolute all alone Stand together Live for each other Ayyanayyanayyan Ayyanayyanayyan Ayyanayyanayyan Ayyanayyanayyan Ayyanayyanayyan Ayyanayyanayyan The whole universe is nothing But a dance of illusion Ayyanayyanayyan Ayyanayyanayyan The whole universe is nothing But a dance of illusion Swamiye Swamiye Swamiye Swamiye Sharanamayyappa 'The path to Pullumedu' Swamiye Maashe Let's sit down Ayyappa We could have left after praying But no you had to come all the way up Pullumedu and see the sacred lamp being lit Today... What is that? Is it blood? It's nothing, maashe Maashe I'll die shitting blood Someone might have cursed me for what I did Sometimes the pain is unbearable That's when I... That's my chemotherapy Maashe, that's why I kept quiet when Saji went to jail in my place If at least for a few days I can hold Suma and my child in my arms What is wrong with you? It's not incurable What cure, maashe? My Jenimol is blind If I disclose my illness I may have to sell my house to pay the hospital bills I want my little girl to start seeing again My well-being is insignificant How can you live with it, Kanna? That's okay, maashe This has been with me for the last couple of years Now and then it hurts Let's go, maashe Could you give me some water? Let me get it (Jenimol's laughter) (Jenimol's laughter) [Jenimol] Acha... [Jenimol] My goodbye kiss Move aside, swami Kanna Here it is Kanna Kanna Hey Comrade Swami, get away quickly Nobody knows how many are injured or how many died Lord Ayyappa, it seems like the hill is shaking people off it Move Move Sir Sir, please help There are reports of a major stampede in Pullumedu forest where thousands gather to witness the lighting of the sacred lamp at Sabarimala Details of the accident are not yet available The bulk of Sabarimala pilgrims are from the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Most pilgrims go to Pullumedu after praying at Sabarimala to see the lighting of the sacred lamp Reports confirm that a record number of pilgrims went to Pullumedu this year Devaswom Minister is speaking to the media from Thiruvananthapuram Over to him No, we don't know about the death toll yet There was an unprecedented number of people at Pullumedu All we know is that several people died due to heavy rush We are deploying more forces to coordinate rescue efforts There is no cause for concern This government will support the affected We will provide their families with all kinds of assistance The government will take charge of these families Moreover, the Tamil Nadu government has promised to help The government is handling the matter with utmost care Hold this Move Make way, swami K.T. Kannan Puthiyangu Lakshamveedu Chekkunnu P.O., Kannur 'The start of a new academic year' Maashe You look so pretty Do you like your new dress? This blue sky This sunshine These flowers down the lane These hearts that sing the glory of love These eyes that light up a thousand lights What are they but Maashe Your benevolent offering Your showers of graceful blessing Maashe, who creates situations that a man uses to his advantage? Your song of deepest longing Maashe Maashe Let there be light in my life With the spirit in your kind eyes Let my mind dance with joy With the eternal music in your soul The compensation given by Kerala and Tamil Nadu state governments to the victims of the Pullumedu tragedy brought light into Jenimol's eyes The thought of utilising a pointless death to the benefit of the living could have occurred only in the mind of a rationalist like Ullaas maashu It's been two years but the debate has not ended in Chekkunnu Rationalists claim that maashu did not go to Sabarimala Devotees argue that Lord Ayyappan saved his life Ullaas maashu smiles in reply burying the truth within him
