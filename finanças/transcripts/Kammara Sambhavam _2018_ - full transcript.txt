Ifthis is true, this ministry will not last any longerthan one year. Within that, we should turn this small party ca||ed ILP into a mega institution. That's a||..!! This is a land where nothing new grows. Sheesh! on every flag that was hoisted by the politicians here, what flows is the money that came out of us liquor barons' sweat & blood. Hereafter, we are not going to help any of them. hereafter, they won't get any self-respecting liquor baron here to do that. Hereafter, there should never be a ministry in Kerala without our ILP in it. The goal sounds good. Historical figure? Boys, What ILP has, against the useless ministers ofthe 1960's and 70's. lnstead, one who fought against the British empire, moreover, the oldest freedom fighter alive today, Kammaran Nambiar! if we bring him to the forefront onefine morning..

All of us are going to make a movie about you, Kammarettan. Please get up. Hey,just hold him. How did you find all this? We found it! But these businessmen, Bose... All of you step out. Didn't you hear him? - Bloody old bloke! - l'll kick you. Try calling me again! First let the director listen to it. We'll hear it later. Bro.., every director in Malayalam is inclined eithertowards the Left orthe Right. Right? - That's true. It's been a really long time... Have you heard of Selvan Baba, the Clairvoyant? With extra sensory powers. will come searching for you, to listen to your story. Listen, kiddo.., Back then, the Nambiars who betrayed the Kolathiri King, So, the hill that the traitor crossed, became the 'Traitor's Hill'. Unbeknownst to the British, made them work day and night, and cleared the forests ofAmruthasam udram, He tortured and killed the men among the Tamilians.. He said that he went away to study. It's all right, grandmother. l educated you till 7th grade, so that you could help your grandmother. ...Time would stand still and silent like a mute. rip apart the one who committed the sin, and eat him up! Murugesha... Give me some more time, master. More time? - I can't now. The sugar canes have all dried up in the summer. There is no income. Sir.. Please tell them... Brother! Brother, please tell him. Hey! Stop it. Kam maran Nambiar, son of Vishwam bharan. I'll give it, sir. Keep this for now. Rest I'll give later. This is what you always say. Kammarodisiac. That mad Saheb of yours who's under the spell of Indians, what's he saying? Only then it will affect the nerves that 'need to rise'. And, Why? I heard that they came here after quitting the INA. Saheb and Madam... Th...There is a letter, Master. For his grandmother. It's for Malayil Amma. Give it to her. My Lord, First you pay the interest forthe interest; then pay the interest. Get lost, you dog! You will be blessed abundantly, sir. Now you're as bright as gold... Othenettan's small talk with grandmother. To stay for so many years in England... Kammarettan. Malayil Am ma.. Look who's here! Gandhiji? - Yes. That's what. But now, "Harijans" are going to be allowed inside the temple.. English? - Pattar brought it from town. No photo? - Yes. Here. Oh my Gandhiji!

Sir.. -Are you doing good? Sheesh. These kids don't even bathe! I thought I'll take it to Lord Kelu's house.. Bhanu Chechi is always in front of him, right? She wants to take it there, it seems. The leaves for Aunt Gomathy's medicines are over. Kiddo.. Okay, "Kiddo"! What's happening there? Yapping all thetime.. were lnspectors sent there on punishment transfers. one had to go meet... The fanatic craze that Saheb had towards lndian arts..., or even his wife, Madam lrene could tolerate. As Malaria claimed her dear son's life at Amruthasamudram.., She kept venting out that anger against Saheb. What are they doing? What you asked for, yesterday... What's your "Lord Kelu" saying? Come on. Tell me. Daddy! Mother, hold this. The leaves were brought from Ezhimalai. Come fast. - Coming, sir. Need to tell you something. That Kelu molested your sister, right? I will give you a chance. Didn't he shoot himself? I didn't want to make you sad by letting you know. Do you know what Coogan Saheb says about Hitler? He will keep blabbering like that. Mad Saheb. Japanese? One look at their eyes, and you know they were born to win. So that's why you're saving up Japanese currency? Bhanu Edathi, how is Malayil Amma now? Kammarettan has more work during the night, Aunt Gomathy. If he has said that, it must be true. The pain starts immediately when that's stopped. Only he is there if we need something, in this damned village. There will be someone to take care of the house as well. 'Was it me, or the night, that came swimming across the darkness?‘ 'By your side... just to get a glance of you' 'Come to me, with a shower of your sweet tunes from the Bansuri' 'Oh Krishna... The dark Lord' 'Was it me, or the night, that came swimming across the darkness?‘ 'And waited far away, unseen' 'In the drizzle at night, banglesjiggle and smiles bloom' 'Through the window sill' 'l drowned in the beauty that flows through it... like a cloud' 'Was it me, or the night, that came swimming across the darkness?‘ 'And waited far away, unseen' 'As the sugar canes are filled with honey, the harvest season is here, the mind awakens' 'I wandered many a time' 'A lifetime is not enough' 'Oh Krishna... The dark Lord' 'The Bansuri playing, blue eyed one' Come here. Terrorists are hiding and attacking. Run! Master! Don't go! When you buy it forthe Saheb, buy a little for us too. You never listen when ltell you to take a torch while going for night walks. Stopped having your gruel? He asked me not to tell anyone. Bhanu..., You always liked him, right? You should meet him and talkto him. You should convince him to have a change of heart. This is notjust my necessity. Without knowing where he is, how can I? He said that it flows to the river Kabani. It has opened up, again...! Why are you buying this Japanese currency paying such a high price? l have to climb Traitor's Hill tomorrow morning. The leaves for the medicines are over. The Japanese are still dropping bombs like mustard seeds... In the war, the British would lose to the Japanese. All the bosses here including Kelu, Then there would only be Kammaran, the Japanese and their currency. Walking is fine! But take care of your leg. And be ready for any situation. But we captured him. What do we do with him? And on whose command. Looks like they are from this locality. We came looking for medicines to increase Malayil Amma's eyesight; lnspector Saheb suspects that there are lNA members somewhere in this hill. Then how did you know? When I was little, I was bit by a scorpion here once. To Lord Kelu... as the Tamilians stood watching... Then" lwill go meet Lord Kelu once more and come. Kammarettan is very close to the Inspector Saheb here. We will fight from within the country... What news? Losﬂ Japanese, it seems! When America bombed Japan, it wasn't just my dream, that was shattered. It was Coogan Saheb's life as well. and that they would be able to go back soon... she left Coogan and left the country forever. Madam, I'll take it. only you are there for Gomathy and her. Fighting forthe country is good... Don't do anything to Kelu. Promise me! Othenan! loving one's woman, my mother now. To take you along with me. Then how did this happen? in a sudden attack by the Japanese army..., from Singapore to an unknown place. lsaid, unveil the gun! Everything is over. Fire! We didn't understand the meaning of that letter, on that day. and make us fight in the war against the British. Friends of the warforfreedom, Wejoined lNA fascinated by Netaji's radiance..., When lndian soldiers themselves reach the border of our country..., they would change sides as a whole group and join the lNA.., But he was wrong. and the Indians who were given new lives as alms by the Japanese. Wait for sometime, brother. Himanshu, stop! Satnam.. Unable to defeat the Indian troops of the British..., we understood one thing. From Indian minds! Somewhere down the line, we had an idea in mind. Towards the South, the villagers themselves tie up lNA members to trees.. are lndians themselves. We're officially inaugurating it here today. l, Thilakan, hereby pledge that, .. and saving India from enemies within and outside, is my primary & final duty, l have some bad news for you. That's why, Netaji has been killed..!! The media has killed Netaji several times earlier as well. Othenan is a good man. He only hates the sight of me, his sister.

Othenan said that he's going to study in England.., If you give any information about Othenan sir... I don't know to talk about revolution like you. It's a man who has a burning heart full of vengeance. Coming. Just one chance, sir. The temple is his target. Lord Kelu's goons will attackthe Tamil slums. Here. l have to ask the Tamilians to be cautious. Send some weapons with him. Lord Kelu has some doubts. That's dangerous. Kammaretta, be careful. Sir, you'll be blessed abundantly! How is he now? Sir, Murugeshan came with you in the morning. I'll bring it, sir. Othenan and lLP members will come there. We should finish everything by tonight. Kammarettan. Sir.. She wants to meet you. Listen carefully to what I'm going to say now, Bhanu. We need freedom... This is a dangerous game. Who is in there? When you were about to fall.. But.. Othenan will be captured by the Whites any moment. You should return our house and land, that belong to my sister and me. Hey Pattar.. - Yes. But..
