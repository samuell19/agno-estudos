- I don't wanna go this way. - All the good houses are on the other side of town. This is the fastest way. Now come on! - You're meeting Lisa, aren't you? - So what if I am? - But Mom said you had to take me trick-or-treating. - And I am... with Lisa. - I don't wanna be in here. Wait up! - Ben? Ben? Hey, Ben! This isn't funny anymore! - BEN! BEN?! BEN! Ben? Ben! Ben? You should have seen your face! My God. - You two are a couple dummies. You know that, right? Seriously though, you two even breathe a word about this to anyone, I swear to God... - Don't worry, I won't tell anyone... that you scream like a girl! - Hey! I'd watch it if I were you, pal! - Don't take it out on Ben. This was all my idea. I guess I'll just have to find a way to make it up to you somehow. Gross! I can still hear you, you know. - Yeah? Well, maybe you should keep walking, then. - Fine by me. - Hey, where are you going? - This bag isn't gonna fill itself. - Yeah, well, no one lives there, doofus. Come on. We still got two blocks to go. - But I saw someone in the window. - You're wasting your time. - You see? Now can we go? - But I saw someone in there. - Your brother's right, Ben. We should just go. Ben! - What the hell did you do? - It's not my fault, all right? We should really go get that cleaned. - OK. You two are up to something again, right? This is... this is... this is some kind of joke, right? BEN! BEN! - JASON! Trick or treat! - I'll trade you. - Somebody help... please... help... - You all right?! - It's killing them! - Who is? - It's killing them... - Who is? Who is? Where? - The old house... on Oakwood Lane... by the cemetery. It knows what scares you. No... It's here! - What is it? - It's here! Help me! - Where?! What? What is it?! What do you see? - HELP ME!

Hi! - Why can't we just do the festival the four of us, like always? - Grace doesn't know that many people, all right? I... don't know, I just thought it would be nice if she came along. - Sounds like someone's got a crush on the new girl. - Ooh! Grace is in my English class. Yeah, she's cute. - Like you should care? - We're taking it slow, OK? - Yeah. Well, take it from me Leah. If you want something in life, you just gotta go for it. - Just don't freak her out. - And by that you mean scare her off? - OK. Can we stop talking about this? Hey, is it true that... Grace's mom died in a fire or something? - You seem to know an awful lot about this girl. - What?! You know, everyone knows! - There was a car accident last year... it flipped over, caught fire, and Grace barely made it out. - Nice. Girl with a dead mom. Seems like she'll be a lot of fun. NO! No! MOM! - What's she doing?! Get that girl! Get her back! Get her back! - MOM! NO! NO! NO! GET OFF OF ME! SHE'S IN THERE! No! Mom... - Hey! - Jeez. What did I say about just barging in like that? - I'm looking for my horns. Take a pill, like for real. - Not today, OK? Of all days, just not today. - I miss her too, you know. - I know. - Wait, what are you doing? I thought you were going out with some friends tonight. - Dad just called. There was a last minute surgery so he's not gonna be back from the city 'til late. Hey. Looks like it's just you and me tonight. - Well, you could take me with. I'd stay out of the way. - Yeah, right, not a chance. - You're just looking for an excuse not to go. - There's no way I'm taking you with. OK? - They're here. I'll go tell them you'll be right down. - No! Wait! Jenna! Hi. - Hi. - Sorry. I... It's just until my father gets home. - No, it's all good. The party's not until tonight anyway. - This just keeps getting better and better. - So, Grace, this is Sydney, Gavin and Amy. Everyone, this is Grace and... Jenna. - Hi. - Hi. - So... where to? - You know... I'm thinking maybe Jenna wants to check out the House of Horrors. - I'm in. - House of Horrors it is. - OK... - I'm really sorry. She insisted. - No, no! It's OK. - Look, if it gets too much, we can always bring her back, OK? No! Seriously, it's fine. - All right. - Wait up, guys. - Hot dogs! Come and get your hot dogs! - Hey, you! Come on! Keep up! - Shut up! You know I don't like dogs! - Yeah, especially the vicious ones. - Wow, you guys really take your Halloween seriously? - Yeah, well, a town this old, the spirits need at least one night to come out and play, right? - Yeah, welcome to Autumn Ridge, where everyone has a ghost story and everyone is full of sh... - Children here! - Jenna? Jenna! Jenna?! - Are you guys coming? - Isn't she just a ball of energy? - You have no idea. - Hey, hey. Look, I know you're trying to prove a point with her sister, but... maybe we should rethink this. - If you're scared of seeing a little fake blood, maybe you should stay outside. - No, I'm... I'm not scared of a little blood. I'm not! - Good. Are you sure about this? - Of course she is! She's gonna love it. - Whose idea was this? - Sydney? Amy? Leah? Gavin? Gavin? My God! My God. - Grace? - There you are! Grace, come here! My God! - I wonder where Jenna is. - Probably with the others. - Hey. Come on. Let's go. - OK. Wait. OK. - This way. My God! My God! - RAGH! Brains... - Sydney! Come on... Please, no. Anything but blood. God! Don't! Blood! Blood is everywhere! Please! Please! Make it stop! Make it stop! - Gavin! You OK? - Yeah. - Come on. Gavin? Gavin? Honey, where are you? O... K. - Hey, um, we... we weren't... just... - Yeah, this... this isn't... what it looks like at all. - You're not gonna say... - Say anything? Why would I? - Wait, wait. What if she tells Sydney? - I mean, would that be so horrible? She treats you like dirt. - No. Yeah. Hey! Jenna! There you are. - Hey... - So, apparently, Jenna here... I was just telling Gavin that Jenna here... ...wasn't all that scared. - Really? - Yeah. I know, right? I mean, I nearly had a heart attack in there. - So... I say we do the Neverknock. I don't think she can handle the Neverknock. - Try me. - What's the Neverknock? - It means cutting through the cemetery. - Let's go. - You heard the girl. Let's go. - Well, all right. - Guys... - Come on! - It'll be fun. Come on. - OK. Wait, but seriously, what's the Neverknock? - Come on! On Halloween night, 1986, three kids were found dead. Each had been murdered at 59 Oakwood Lane. The cop who discovered the bodies found three words carved into the back of one of the dead kids. - What did the words say? - Never... never... knock. - OK. That didn't happen. - Yes, it did. That's a fact. You can look it up. - OK. So who killed them? - No one knows. - But it knows... what scares you. - What does? - The Neverknock. - OK. There's no way this is true. - It's Halloween, so knock the door three times, say "never, never knock" and you'll see just how true it is. - That is, if you're brave enough. - OK. Come on, I think it's time we took you home. - Come on. - No, wait! I'm not scared! - Hey! Jenna! Don't! - Let's see who answers! - Jenna! Hey! Really?! Don't be stupid, Jenna. OK? Perfect. Get out of there, Jenna! You're being a real brat! - Better than being afraid. - OK. We get it. You made your point. Who's scared now? - Fine. - All right. - Seriously? - HEY! - Let go! - Sorry guys, show's over. - Let go! - Great. Dad's going to love this. Hey! Don't! Don't be a brat, Jenna! - Never... never... knock. - Well, that was fun. - OK. You're coming with me. Now. - Guys! - This is a joke, right? Let's all just... have fun and prank the new girl. - I wouldn't do that to you. I'm outta here! - What the hell just happened?! - Jenna? Jenna! JENNA! Jenna! Jenna? JENNA! - Hey, hey! Grace! Grace! She's not in there! - Get off of me! OK? - She's not there! - Grace, he's right. Look. - Yeah, you... She probably got scared and ran off. - Yeah. - But... I... I just saw... - Look, look, it is probably someone messing with us, right? - Yeah. It's not like it's the first time we've knocked on that door. People do it every Halloween. - I'll go in the house and look with you if you want, but... I think these guys are right. I think Jenna took off. Sorry... Come on. - Jenna! Jenna! Jenna, it's... It's not funny, Jenna! Come on. - Jenna! - Jenna! - Jenna! - Jenna, where are you? - She's still not answering. - You're sure she has her phone? - Jenna would never go anywhere without her phone. - Jenna! - Where the hell are you?! - Jenna? - Jenna! - Hi. Hi, Dad. Sorry, I... I thought you were someone else. No, no, no, everything's... everything's good. Yeah. She's just in the house. I'm waiting for her before we go check out downtown. Yeah, no, it'll be fun. Don't worry, OK? We're getting along just fine. OK. Well... we won't wait up. See you tomorrow. I love you too. I'm going back. I never should have left that house without checking it. What am I thinking?! - Are you guys coming? - Gavin! - What? We can't let them go by themselves, right? - Yeah, we can. - Come on. - Jenna, where are you? Jenna? Jenna, if this is you, you need... you need to stop messing around! OK? Jenna? Hello? Hello! Quick! - Wait, wait. Whoa. What just happened? - I don't know! OK, let's go. - Come on! Jenna, if this is a game you're playing, you need to stop, all right? My God! Quick! - Grace, wait! You don't know who that might be! - Come on! - This sucks. Grace? Grace? Grace? Grace? - Sh! Listen. Do you hear that? Just... right there. - OK, I think it's time we find help. - Yeah, I'm with Leah. - Look! No, OK? If someone has Jenna and we leave now, we may never see her again. - OK, so what if this isn't Jenna just messing with us and someone actually has her. What do you expect to do once we find them? - You guys do what you want, OK? I'm going after my sister. - Grace, wait! OK. Come on. I'll start a group chat. Whoever finds Jenna contacts the others. - No! We're not going! - But Sydney, we have to! - No, we don't. - OK, look. If this goes south, I don't want to be the one telling the cops that we just stood by and did nothing. - OK, but what if... What if it's true? - What's true? - Look, you saw the blood on the door and you heard that sound. What if it's... you know... - It's a ghost story, Sydney. - OK, then how do you explain it? - Hey, hey. Look, I don't know what the hell is going on, but I promise you... the Neverknock's not real. OK? - Do you two... need a moment alone or can we go? - Yeah. Come on. JENNA! - Jenna? - This way. - Which way? - Maybe we should split up. - No way in hell, like that ever works out well for anyone. - Well, I... - Come on, this way. - Wait! Jenna? Jenna? - Wait, um... - This way. - This way, yeah. - Guys, I... I found Jenna's phone. - Grace? - Sydney! Sydney?! That sounds like Sydney! - Sydney! Where did you go?! - Sydney! - What's happening?! - SYDNEY! - What's happening?! - I don't know! Come on! This way! - Sydney, you need to tell us where you are! What's happening?! - Sydney! Where are you? Sydney! Sydney! You're scaring us! SYDNEY! - HELP ME! Help! Please, somebody help! Help! Please! It's killing me! - Sydney! - SYDNEY! WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?! - SYDNEY! - SYDNEY! - Sydney! - Help me! Please! Please help me! Please! It's killing me! Please... SYDNEY! SYDNEY! SYDNEY! Please... Help me. Please. Why won't you help me? No! No, no, no, no! No, no, no! No! No! - OK, we have to go. Now! - What? What was that Was that? - It has her! All right? Look! Look, we really need to get out of here! - What? What's going on? - What happened to Sydney? - I think... I think... it killed her. It killed her. - What?! What killed her? Gavin! What killed her? - The Neverknock, OK?! It's real. - OK. Cut it out Gavin. This isn't funny! - Let's just... let's just go! OK? - OK. It knows... it knows what scares us. OK? - Look, I don't have time for jokes, OK? - OK, then you two do whatever the hell you want! If you want to live, you'll come with me. - Gavin! - No. Wait! Did you see Jenna?! Did you see my sister? - What do we do? - I don't know! - Wait! Where are you going? - He's not making any sense, all right? I have to find my sister. - But... God damn it. - Gavin! Gavin! - We don't have time! - GAVIN! Gavin! Tell me what you saw! Tell me what happened. Gavin, please. You need to tell me what happened. - Please. - OK. OK. It... it... it knew Sydney was afraid of needles, that's why she was screaming, and I... No. Blood. - What? What blood? - Blood. No. - Gavin, what's wrong? What is it?! - No. NO! LEAVE ME ALONE! - What is it?! Gavin! What blood? GAVIN! - Jenna? No... No, no, no... - We need to call the police. - I've... I've gotta get out of here. I need to find my sister. - Grace? Grace! Trick or treat! - Gavin! Trick or treat! - Gavin! Gavin! Gavin! Gavin! - No, no, no... NO! - What's going on? - The fire! The... The fire! It's everywhere! The fire! - Grace! Grace! There's no fire! - NOOO! No! NO! MOM! - It can't be. - No, I can't! It's everywhere! What do you want?! I'm getting us out of here! Come on! - Trick or treat. - Thank you so much. - There you go. - Thank you. - Hey! Wait, wait! Wait, wait! Please, please! OK? I need your help! No... No! No, please! Please, make it stop! - Should we wait for the police? - And tell them what? It's burning! It's burning! - There's no fire there! What you're seeing, the fire, it's not real! What the hell is going on?! Why is this happening to me?! Grace! Grace, I can't... - What? - I can't run anymore. - What?! Come on, please! - What do you think? Is it gone? - I think whatever that thing is, whatever did that to Sydney, it could have Jenna. I just abandoned her. I just... I left her. I just left her there. - Listen to me. We're no good to Jenna if we're dead. All right? She's smart right? That kid doesn't seem like she's afraid of anything. So we're gonna find her. We're gonna get help. Gavin... I have been looking everywhere for you! - No, no, no. - Gavin! What's wrong? - LEAVE ME ALONE! - Why are you running from me? - Get away from me! - What's going on?! Just tell me what's going on! I don't understand! - NO! Just go away! - Gavin! Gavin, please. - What do you want from me?! - Gavin, I don't understand! - What do you want from me?! God... God... - Gavin, please! - God! What is happening?! - Gavin, please! What is going on? Gavin... GAVIN, BEHIND YOU! Gavin! No, Gavin! God... No! No! No! Gavin! Don't do this to me, Gavin! Please, don't do this to me! Gavin! What... No! - Come on. - Come on! - It's... - My God. - It's gonna kill all of us, isn't it? - No. No, it's not. It's not killing anyone else, all right? Listen to me. Like you said, we're gonna get help. OK? We're gonna go to the police and tell them everything. Then we're gonna go and find Jenna. Come on. - Officer, I know who did this. - Grace! Grace! Grace! No! - Hey! Hey, stop! - What do we... what do we do? - It's never going to let us go for help. - So what, we just wait for it to come for us? - We can call. Yeah, we can... we can just call. God! No, no, no! No, no, please! My God. I must have dropped it in the maze. - I have mine. I have mine. OK. - We need to go! - What? - We need to go! - This way! What did you see back there? - I saw... - I saw a... a dog. Doberman I think, but... its eyes... We need to keep going, okay? - I just... I need a minute. - No, we have to keep moving. Trust me, we have to keep moving! - How do we know it's not waiting for us out there? - It's not real, okay? Look, the fire, the dogs... maybe they can't hurt us if we don't believe... if we're not afraid... Okay? We have to just... - It's coming! It's right behind us! Grace, stop! - What is it? What do you see? - It's... dogs. They're everywhere. Grace! Grace, we have to go! It's coming... it's coming! - Wake up, Leah! Okay, quick! Climb! Climb, Leah, climb! - Grace! Grace, come on! What just happened? - I don't know. My God. It wanted you here. - What... Amy? - It wanted you here to watch. - It wanted us here to watch what? - To watch it kill me. - No! No one else is getting killed, alright? My God, you're bleeding. - Soon, that will be the least of your worries. - Shut up, okay? Shut up! Okay... Okay, okay... Okay. That'll have to do for now, alright? - Do you have your phone? - It won't let me use it. We should have never knocked on that door. - No, don't! - What? - You don't see them, do you? The maggots... and the worms. You don't see them? - None of this makes any sense! Why is it doing this? - To feed on our fears... - Look... Just stop it, okay? We're gonna find a way through this. - Don't fool yourself. Amy! No! Amy! No! Amy! No! - No! Leah, help me! - No! No! Leah, help me! - Go! Quick! Go, go, go! Hurry! Hurry! - Hey! Get in! Look, I know what's after you! Get in! - Run! Go! Come on! Quick! - Where are you taking us? - Your leg needs some attention. Here. - What is this? - It's me. That's me thirty odd years ago. I'm the one that found those kids... ...the ones you all tell stories about come this time every year. I tried to tell everyone, I tried to warn them all, but no one paid any attention to me. They just thought seeing those kids like that, maybe it had done something to my head, making me unstable. They all thought I was nuts. I wasn't nuts. I was starting to come around to that way of thinking myself. I was starting to believe it. Maybe I did imagine the whole thing. And then you two show up. You two and those friends of yours... Yeah. - What? You were watching the house? - I watch that house every Halloween since those murders, just to see if it would happen again. - If you knew this could happen, why didn't you stop us? - Because I had to find out if I was crazy or not. - My friends are dead because of you, you son-of-a-bitch! - Stop it! - Leah! - Are you trying to kill us all? - You already did that. Wait! Stop the van! - What? - Stop the van! It's Jenna! - Okay, okay! - Jenna! Jenna! Jenna! - Grace? - Hey, wait there! - Grace, wait! That's not Jenna! Grace... Grace, you need to listen to me, that wasn't Jenna. - No, I know what I saw, okay? It's her. - No, it's not. It's not. I saw it too and it was that... thing. - No, it's Jenna, okay? It has to be! - Grace... - What? - I would never lie to you, okay? And I will do whatever it takes to find your sister, but what you saw back there, it's not Jenna... it's just not. Okay? It's not. Now let's get the hell out of here before it finds us. Come on. Excuse me. Listen to me, both of you. - Hey! - Just hold it down! - Get off of me! - Okay, okay. I'm just trying to help, okay? - It's a little late for that. - Do you want to find a way to live through tonight or not? Okay. We'll start by getting your legs looked at. Let's fix that. Come with me, this way. Go inside this building. It's okay. Yeah, down here. Okay, here, here. Come on. - It's okay. - In here. How are you doing? - It hurts. - Just put her down here. - It's getting worse! - Tell you what, let's put some of this on it and maybe we can... maybe we can disinfect. - So why us? If you've been watching that house every Halloween for all of these years and nothing's happened, then why was tonight any different? - Hold that. You see this door? It's kind of unique? This door comes from a house in the Midwest. They found four... murdered kids in there. And that was in 1952, and then three more in 1964. I'm sorry. - This is it. In 1949, same door... on a warehouse two hundred miles east of there. They found six mutilated bodies inside there and they found those bodies on Halloween night. That's about as far back as I can track anything. - If you knew all this, then why didn't you destroy it, just get rid of the goddamn door? I don't know... Part of me just... just didn't want to believe it could be true. Now, can it? - We need to get the hell out of here. - It still doesn't answer a question. Why tonight, okay? Why us? - Was there any blood? - What? - When I found those kids, there was blood on the door. And then I saw the little girl in the devil's outfit. She came over the fence, looked like she might be hurting. - That was Jenna. You would have seen Jenna. Tell me what happened to her. TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TO HER! - Grace, we have to be quiet, okay? - Tell me what happened to her. - One minute she was there and then the next minute she was gone. - What do you mean, gone? - You all just ran from the door at that point. She just wasn't there anymore. She was gone. - It was leading us away. It was leading us away this entire time. It... it wanted us as far away from that house as possible! - Grace! - Where are you going? - Give me the flask. - No, no, no. - Grace, what are you doing? - Where are you going? I'm going to get my sister. No! No! Leah! - Fight, Leah, fight! Grace, you need to save me! - Jenna? I hear my sister! - If you heard her, you should go! Just be sure it's her! Go after your sister, I'll go after Leah. Go! Leah! - Jenna! Jenna! Jenna! Where did you go? - Why, Grace? Why didn't you save me? Why, Grace? Why didn't you save me? - You can't be my mother. - Why did you leave me to burn? They're going to lock you up, Grace. - I'm not afraid. You're not even real. - If they lock you up, how will you find your sister then? - No! - Leah? Leah? Leah? - You have to help me! - Calm down, calm down. - You need to help me! - I'm here. Listen, take this. Two hands, okay? I can't see it, you can. I want you to shoot the son-of-a-bitch, you understand? Leah! Leah! Leah! I shouldn't be able to see you. 'cause I was there. I was there when they knocked. Stay away from me! Leave me the hell alone! Aah! No! No! Help! You're not real. You're not real. Okay... You're not real. You're not real. Okay... - Hello, Grace. Join us, Grace. Join your sister and me. - Get off of me! - How does it feel knowing your mother and your sister are dead because of you? - No, she's not dead! Jenna's not dead! - Your friends are all dead because of you... Leah, your sister, their deaths are going to eat at you, Grace! You should just kill yourself now... spare yourself the pain. I'll be more than happy to help. - Jenna and Leah are not dead! Jenna! Grace? Grace! - Jenna? I'm coming, Jenna! I'm coming! It's not real... It's not real! I'm not afraid... I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid. - Grace? Grace, what's going on? Are you okay? - I'm okay. I'm okay. You think you're gonna burn me? You asshole! You're the one that's gonna burn, you and that goddamn door! - Grace? - Jenna! Jenna! What's going on, Jenna? Tell me! - You need to leave before it's too late. - What? No... Okay... Jenna! Jenna! I'm not leaving you, okay? We're getting out of this together! Jenna? Why aren't you answering me? Jenna? Jenna, I'm coming. Answer me, Jenna. No... No, no, no! Jenna, baby! Jenna, please! Please! No! My God! No... Okay, listen to me. Listen to me. You're never been afraid of anything your entire life. Okay? So fight! Fight, Jenna, fight! God! Okay... okay! Listen to me. We're gonna need to get you down from here, baby, okay? And it's gonna hurt, but you're gonna have to stay with me, okay? Okay? I know, sweetie, I know! - Grace! Grace, behind you! - No! - There's no time! - We're leaving together, okay, sweetie? - No! Run, Grace! Grace, there's no time! - Come on! - No! Run, Grace, run! No! Grace! No, no, no, Grace! Grace! No, no, no! No! No! Grace, no... No, Grace! Grace! Grace! No... No! Leave her alone! Just leave her alone! No! No, leave me alone! You bastard! I'm... gonna... kill... you! No... No! I'm not afraid. I... am not... afraid! I am not afraid. I am not afraid. I... am not... afraid. You're trying to feed on my fear. But you can't, because I'm not afraid. - We all died for you. Now it's your turn, Jenna. - Why did you knock on that door, Jenna? - Why should you be the only one that lives? - Leah? - Get the hell off her! We're not afraid of you, asshole! No... - Don't worry, it's not... it's not yours. Take it... Finish the job. You need to end this so it never happens again. I'm dead either way. I'd rather... I'd rather it count for something. I need you to do this... ...for Grace. - Are you afraid to die? Jenna, do it. Pull the trigger. Jenna, do it now! How does that feel? I did it, Grace. I... I killed that son-of-a-bitch. - We need to get EMTs in here right now! Clear path! - Got an ambulance coming through! Let's move! Closed Captioning by SETTE inc
