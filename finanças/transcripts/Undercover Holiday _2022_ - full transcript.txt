We're on in 30. Ready, graphics? Ready camera? Graphics? You know our next act as the recent winner of Pop Star USA. And, her new single, which keeps climbing the charts... "Baby, My Baby, Won't You Be My Baby?" That is a lot of baby's, right. Please join me in welcoming the lovely... Jaylen Rodriguez! Thank you so much for having me. And we're clear! - Oh! Did it play well? - Yes. Ah! It's always so weird when there's no one in the audience. Trust me, you brought down the house! The internet is going crazy. People who didn't even know you on Pop Star USA sure know who you are now. - Ah! - And, we're going on tour. - We're going on tour! - We're going on tour! - We're going on tour. - We're going on tour! We're going on tour. I got an update. I'm getting real-time data from the record label, and ticket sales are already up. Oh, that's great to hear. Imagine if we threw a tour and nobody came? You know, this whole self-deprecating thing is charming and all, but you got to start acting like the star that you are. Hey, this is all new to me. I will never be a diva, Benny. Know how many clients I've had who've told me that? Of course, you're the first one that I actually believe. Hey, thanks again, for putting your trip back a few days to do this. This is gonna pay off. I hope so, because my family was not thrilled about that. Yeah, well, they're gonna get over it. Yeah, you don't know her family. They get over nothing. Ever since we were kids. - It's kind of their thing. - True. You know, they know what's best, and who am I to tell them they're wrong? Well, you could... - But you don't. - Okay, guys, time to go. - Oh. - Got it? Time to go. Get your stuff, get your stuff. Alright. I just got a text from the President of Blue Six Records. They are quite pleased with you, Jay. Oh, that's amazing! But did they ever listen to my songs? Look, they invested a lot in you. That's why they rented out studio in your town for you to rehearse over Christmas. It's why they're flying in Tyler Huston to teach you choreography. Well, that sounds great, but I'm gonna take that as 'no'. I'm just a commodity to them. Well, a little bit, welcome to LA. No, Benny, listen... In my culture, music is not just music. It is a soundtrack of our lives. It's a part of every moment, and I want to give the fans the music that has been a gift to me, my whole life! I could be a crossover artist, both markets. Sing songs in English and Spanish. Yes, you can, but, right now, they have fantastic writers working on material just for you. Like, the best of the best. Songs with more "baby" in the title! Exactly! It's like working with my family. Everyone else knows what's best for me, but no one cares what I want or think. Look, you are new on the scene, and we have to go with the momentum. You have to prove to the label that you are a team player. Remember the plan, okay. We're gonna get to your songs. You just gotta be patient. Hey! I'm not gonna let you down, Jay. You're like the daughter I never had. You have two daughters, Benny. Yeah, but they're five. You're like the grown up daughter I never had. Aye, Benny, Benny, Benny. You gotta teach me some of that Spanish. What she said was nice, right? - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. - Oh, my. - Oh! Hi, hi, hi! - Hello, whoa. - No, no, no. Abuela's gonna see this. We'll figure how to spin it, it'll be fine, it'll be fine. Jaylen! Who are you wearing? Yeah, here we go. Get out of my way! Oh, wow. Hey, stop the car, stop the car. - Hold on, hold on, hold on. - What's going on? Why is the gate open? We closed it before we left. - I always check. - She does. - I really did. - She does, Benny. Hey, hey! Beat it, guy! Go! Get the window up. Up, window, up, let's go, go, go, go! Go, go, go! Are you serious? That was invasive. Very strange. Benny, how does he know where I live? This is a rental. Paps are annoyingly resourceful. Wow. You think that guy... put these here? No, no, he knows to stay on public property. He just wants to get a candid shot of you shoving fruitcake in your mouth. No, these, and that gate, I think somebody was in here. Like, inside? In here. Okay... - Thank you. - So, good news... There's no signs of forced entry inside. Thank you so much. You know... I was in an a cappella group in college, called Tone Def. D-E-F. Oh. BA-BA-BOM BOM-BOM-BOM-BOM IT CAME UPON A MIDNIGHT CLEAR... That's beautiful, that's... gorgeous. Yeah. I was talking to your guys back there and they're telling me that there's gonna be nothing on the security cams, and the flowers, the prints are only gonna be ours, is that right? Might I suggest a Doberman? Thank you so much for rushing over! You guys, you guys are great. Of course. I spoke to Barb, at the label. - About this? - Yes, I had to text her. Somebody came onto the property. What are the odds she listened to some of Jay's songs and wants to add them to the tour? Not so great. They want to get security and they got this company they like to use. So, okay, that's not all. Ah, the security guy, they want him to be with you 24/7. What does that mean? That means that he goes home with you to... to, where is it you're from again? Squirrel Hollow. That's made up, that's gotta be made up. Benny! You don't know my family. I can't bring some stranger home with me for Christmas. I can't be there to protect you. I weigh 165 pounds soaking wet, and if I miss another holiday for work, I'll be divorced by Friday. We don't want that, but I'm not asking for this. Tell 'em my brother was an all-star wrestler in high school. That works. - Yes! - That'll work, that'll be fine. This is non-negotiable. They're gonna think the worst. Abuelo and Abuela are from Mexico. A little bodyguard means serious business. It's in the contract. They get to call the shots. Are they overreacting? Probably. Do we want to rock the boat this close to the tour? We do not. Fine.. But we will get them to listen to my songs. We will get there, but right now, we're gonna keep you safe. Oh, hey, oh, ah! - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? You're trespassing! Okay, just a little piece of advice, next time you hear a suspicious sound, maybe stay inside with your phone, and then use it to call the police. Thanks for the tip. Now, who are you, huh? Paparazzi? You're not allowed on private property. Matt Lowis. I was sent by Blue Six Records to protect you. Right. You put all your bosses in a headlock, or am I just special? I'm sorry... Okay? I was doing a sweep, looking for vulnerabilities on your property, which are numerous, by the way. Not the least of which, the woman I'm supposed to be protecting making herself completely vulnerable. So, what'd you break? I heard a crash. I don't know, I think it was... a gnome? - You killed Lenny? - It was a gnome. - Do you have any coffee? - Yeah. Oh! Look what you made me do! Oh, this is not starting off well. Well, at least the smoke detector works. And all the deadbolts work on the outside doors. It's a rental. Yeah, we're gonna have to call the landlord. I could jimmy the laundry room door open with my bobby pin. You carry bobby pins with you? Yeah, you never know when you have to use 'em. Maybe for hair emergencies. You're very thorough. Yeah, well, I'm good at what I do. Ah, clearly... Cookie? Oh, thanks. I didn't realize gingerbread men wore dresses. They do at Christmas, although... these aren't looking good, and these are burnt, thanks to you, and... I'll have to figure out when to go to the panderia. Listen, um... My manager thinks the label is overreacting. Do you? Well, it's not for me to say. I'm just here 'til they tell me I'm done. - Hola! - Well, here and Squirrel Hollow. - We have a problem. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Whoa, whoa? - Who are you? Who are you? This is my best friend and personal assistant. You do not have to cuff her. - My new security. - Bodyguard. - Matt. - Margot. Yeah, so, your cop friend wants to be a hero. No! We do not believe the intruder at Jaylen Rodriguez's home last night is related... No! To the string of robberies in the area. No, no, no, no! - And there it is. - Mm... mhm. Oi! It's her, watch. Hola, Abuela. An intruder?! No one was inside. It was just a... wrong delivery, wrong address. But your home is Fort Knox. Nobody could accidentally get in there. Come back home! You can still go to LA and record your records. And then come back home. Then, we can protect you. That's not how it works, Abuelita. Cousin Jorge said not moving to LA was the best decision he ever made. Si. Well, Cousin Jorge also didn't get into any schools here. I don't know how much more of this Abuela's heart can take. Think of what this worry is doing to her! Stop fussing about my health! I'm perfecta, I'm perfecta! I'm just so worried about her living in that house all by- Basta! Everyone, we will talk when Jaylen gets home tomorrow. Thank you, Hector. That sounds like a great idea. Oh, we are going to talk, Jay Jay. This is no laughing matter. Okay, I love you, thank you, bye! You're gonna love them. Mhm. Oh, I'm so excited to be home, Margot. Wow, you are booked literally until the end of time. - Safety first. - Of course. - Thank you. - You are gonna be busy. And Tyler, the choreographer, is flying in to work with you on Saturday. As long as I'm done at a decent hour. You know my family will have wall-to-wall Christmas plans. I do. Have we vetted this Tyler guy? It's Tyler Huston. Hello! The lead host and judge of World's Greatest Dancer. That means nothing to me. Don't worry, he's vetted. Where are we going? Well, you made me burn my cookies and I can't show up empty-handed, so I'm gonna pick some up for my family. Cookies are gonna be the last thing on their minds when they meet soldier boy over here. What are you planning to tell your family about me? I was hoping they'd be too mesmerized by my cookies to notice you. Hey, how's your Spanish? You wanna be my long, lost cousin, visiting for the holidays? Ha, no. The label is validating my family's concerns for my safety. It's really unfair. Hey, every celebrity has security. They don't see me as a celebrity. They'll be calling me Jay Jay, La Cobaya until I'm 60. Cobaya? It's 'guinea pig'. You know them, Margot, they won't understand. Once they get their minds stuck on something... It's true, since we were kids. But it's gonna be fine, it's gonna be fine. Hey, the car's here, let's go! Come, come on! - Papi! - Mi amor. Okay! Mami, que guapa! Mwah! - Abuela... - Oh! Oh, my goodness! Felicidades! - And brother. - Jay-Jay La Cobaya is home. Hector, you can't call me that anymore. I'm a grown woman. Oh, so now that you're a superstar, you're too fancy to be La Cobaya? She has been traveling the whole day. - Feliz Navidad, mijita. - Feliz Navidad, a todo. You've grown. Have you grown?! Papi, you just saw me in LA. But I know who has grown, Faith. You are glowing! Oh, please, I'm a house, nothing fits. And if I walk up three steps, I need a nap. It'll all be worth it when this precious arrives because I am going to spoil him, her, them. No, I don't think so, it's a her. I can feel the vibe, and I'm never wrong. Nobody asked you, Abuela. Come inside out of the cold. Margot, thank you for getting her home to us safely. - Absolutely. - Will you come inside? I would really love to, I just haven't seen my family in so long. But I promise I will be back very soon. Will you be here for the nativity tomorrow? Oh, wouldn't miss it. And, who might you be? Si, Mija, who is this handsome young man? Are you with Margot? Oh, no. Oh, that's a funny story. Papi, Mami, Abuela... This is Matt, my bo-Boyfriend. - Your boyfriend?! - Boyfriend? You haven't said anything about date or anything, ah... since you broke up with Eddie. Yep, surprise! Margot, I will handle this. You enjoy the holiday. - Really? You sure? - Mhm! Alright! See you soon. -I am not- -Actually, come on in! And let's get you settled, and then you can tell us absolutely everything about yourself. Aye, mi amor. - Bye, bye. - Okay. - What are you doing? - Um... You and I are an item now. Now, ah, that's not gonna happen. Ah, yes, it is. You need to work with me 'cause you don't know what you're settling in for. Your family sure takes Christmas seriously. Buddy, you got no idea. I'm sorry. I panicked. Look, I cannot do this, I won't lie. Everything has to be on the level. - Level? - Mija! - Come visit for a moment. - Okay. And then, you can go unpack. - Okay, mhm. - Vamos. Vamos, vamanos. Como estas? This door doesn't have a lock. Yes, it broke, and I never got around to fixing it. Actually, we don't lock any of the doors. There's no need. That's a mistake. Matt, please take your coat off. Come in and tell us what it is you do. He's a contractor. Yeah, my boyfriend, he's always looking at... houses and structures and... Doors. So, where are you from, Matt? Ah, Cleveland! You know what, it's been a long day. We should go unpack, and we will have plenty of time to visit at dinner, right? Get to know each other. Yes, well, let's get the room set up. Okay. Separate rooms. Aye, amor, por favor. Matt, let's get you out of here, yeah. So nice. I'll go get the room ready. Cleveland, really? Yeah, where are you from? Simi Valley. Yeah, I probably should've asked. Jaylen, I won't lie. We're not really lying, we're... Fabricating a backstory. - So, lying. - For less than a week! We have a fun Christmas with my family and then we go our separate ways. Not necessarily. I leave when the label says. You're a rule follower, aren't you? Yeah, that's what we do. And what does that mean? I was a Navy Seal. You can never let your guard down. I mean, what happens if you do? I don't know, it's never happened. Well, that sounds exhausting. So, where's my room? Right this way, sir. - Thank you. - Mi casa, su casa. So, why aren't you a Navy Seal anymore? I got injured during drills. Honorable discharge. And the next logical step for you was babysitting pop stars? Ha... you know, a simple thank you for keeping you safe would suffice. Thank you, but I didn't ask for any of this. Oh, trust me, neither did I. I, I hope this works for you. If we'd known you were coming, we'd have been more prepared. Comfy cozy. Give it a try. - Oh, no, it's fine. - I insist. Okay. Ha... - Oh! - Ah... You take my room, I'll sleep here. No, no, no. No, this is... perfect. We need your help tomorrow with the Nacimiento. You got here just in time. Living nativity. We do it in our front yard, neighbors come out. Oh, yeah? All the neighbors are coming out? - Ah, no, just some. - No, got it. So, how many neighbors are there? Do you, do you know them all? Yes! It's such a friendly community. And we're going to introduce you to all of our traditions, Matt. Yeah, and you can share all your family traditions, too. Listen, I'm just here to make sure- Enjoy Christmas! And not have any stress before the tour, yeah, me too. You get settled, and we'll see you downstairs for dinner. Abuela made champorado just for your return! Oh, gracias, Abuela! Que rico! Champorado, it's Indigenous Mexican hot chocolate. I'm so sorry. I'm not asking you to do this for me. Think of that sweet, old lady. Do you want to be the one to kill her with worry? Because I don't. You artistic types definitely have a flair for the dramatic, don't you? That lady looks healthier than any of us. They didn't want me to go to LA, or audition for the show. I would think not, after what happened to Cousin Jorge. They told you about that? I overheard the phone conversation. You don't miss a thing, do you? I'm paid not to miss a thing. Well, if my parents, my family had it their way, I would be off at Hannigan's every Thursday singing karaoke, like Lorelei. Who is Lorelei? She's... An old friend. She beat me out for every role in the school play. She was Belle, I was the fork. She was- Maria. And I was the Von Trapp boy. She was Annie, and I was the dog. We both worked at the local newspaper, and we saw that the network put out an ad to have auditions, so we decided to go together. I won, and Lorelei got cut after round two. Where is she now? Singing karaoke at Hannigan's every Thursday! I thought you could keep up. Sorry. When she came back, she told everyone that LA was a crime -ridden cesspool. And it only added fuel to my family's fire. You're right, this is ridiculous, I'll... I'll get some blankets for more cushion. Or, I won't... until you go along with this. Look, I'm gonna do this because I want to keep the label happy. But the moment it becomes unsafe- if it becomes unsafe- we come clean, okay? This is not a game, Jaylen. I can see that. Now get ready, it's Thursday and the rest of the gang's at Hannigan's and we're gonna see them, come on! It's gonna be fun, karaoke, Christmas! - Woohoo! - Okay. Oh, I'll get us a table. Okay, thank you. Hey, you made it! Faith didn't want to come? No, she said, "This baby is kicking, go without me." Well, more like she yelled it at me. Alright, well, hey, I know it must be hard for her, so thank you for coming. Of course. What, what are you doing? This is what couples do. No, I am not crossing any lines with you, okay. It's unprofessional. It's a hand, not a marriage proposal. Work with me here. Thank you. Now come on, honey. - This way, guys. - Oh, cool. Oh, yes, of course! Here you go! There you are. I can't believe it, the Jaylen Rodriguez, here in Hannigan's? - It's like, "Ah!" - I know, right? Oh, Char, I'm your old friend, who fell off the pyramid and broke your collar bone at Cheer finals. It's just, you're so famous. I'm still me, Char, right? - Does she know yet? - Know what? Yeah, I just found out you have been chosen to be the Grand Marshall, this year, at the Christmas Eve tree lighting? - Me? - Mhm. Oh, wow! They're really particular about who does that. You're kind of a big deal. Well, I'm barely getting used to the fact that people care I exist. I mean, well, besides my family. - Tree lighting? - Oh, huge honor. Everyone comes to the town square for the lighting. Are you sure it's a good idea, you know, to be so... exposed? I mean, to the cold, you know, just before you go on tour. We'll have hand warmers. And hot water, lemon, it'll be fine. - Everyone ready? - Yeah! - Got us a table. - Okay. You will never guess who I bumped into. It's Lorelei! Tah-dah! Hey... - You alright? - Yeah. - Hey! - Hey. Hi. It's great to see you live in person. It's a, it's usually on my TV. Yeah, it's great to be home. I've missed everyone. And you, who might you be? Oh, right. This is my boyfriend, Matt Lucas. Lowis. It's an inside joke. Big Star Wars fan right here so, that's what I call him. Huge... huge. You know, Jaylen, Eddie's home for Christmas, too. Eddie's Jaylen's ex. They were supposed to move to LA together, but I guess they both moved on. Yeah! It'll be good to see him too. To see everyone. So, how did you and Jaylen meet? Yes, tell us how an ordinary Joe such as yourself lands a superstar like my baby sister. Well, that's a funny story actually. You want to tell it, babe? No. You little prankster. - I introduced them. - That's not funny. Oh, you have not heard the whole story yet. So, Matt-- and I met on a dating app. And, he was so not my type, I was not feeling it. Um, he, he... hates the Cowboys. And, does not recycle. So, I said, "You should meet my best friend 'cause she would love you," and he did. And she did, and... they did, and... Here we are! Why don't you recycle? Do you hate the earth? You know what, how, how come no one is singing? You know, is it not karaoke night anymore? Jay, you and Lorelei should do a sing-off, just like old times. Lorelei, that would be fun, right? No, I don't want to do duets anymore. Come on, Lorelila... you and I used to bring the house down. - So many great memories! - Okay... Okay, okay! Sing off, sing off, sing off! Thanks, guys. What do you say to Christmas Medley #8? You sure you're up for #8? - It's been a while. - I got the muscle memory. I could do 8, 9, 10, you name it. - Okay, #8, it is. - Okay. I'll take the first part, you take the second? Oh, God, I live for the second part. Hit it! That's a terrible gift. What's with all the birds? Oh, you go, girl. - Exit, back door, now! - What? Wait! It's nothing! What is he doing? Stop! What is the matter with you? Look, I'm just here to keep you safe from any threats. That was a broken glass! There are no threats! I'm doing my job, alright, which apparently entails performing for your family and your friends. So, how about just a little gratitude? I appreciate you for going along with this. But my career is taking off way more than I expected. And I just want a normal Christmas with my family, which you are coming dangerously close to ruining, so why don't you try to get into the spirit, or I'll find someone else who will. Yeah, we'll call the label in the morning, and we'll get them to send someone... who likes... ugly Christmas sweaters. Who thinks eggnog is a food group. Or maybe someone who has an improve background! - Good! - Great! Hey... Is... everything okay here? Heard you were here. News travels at the speed of light in this town. Hey, I'm Eddie. Matt. I'm Jaylen's... Boyfriend. Jaylen doesn't have a boyfriend. And how would you know that? Well, you know, entertainment news, social media. Oh, yeah, are you checking up on her? Don't worry, pal. Sounds like you figured out the way to her heart. Bringing someone home for a Rodriguez family Christmas... Sounds pretty serious. See you at Nacimiento. Hey... Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, I just had enough of this trip down memory lane for the night. I want to go home. Okay, good. Finally something we can agree on. Don't you want to know what that was about, back there? I don't like to get emotionally involved in my client's lives. You don't like me very much, do you? It doesn't matter what I think, alright. It matters what I do. However, you're not my first pop star, and you probably won't be my last. Well, I'm not who you think I am. That whole sweetheart image on the show... I don't think anything, alright, and I don't judge, and I don't assume. I'm just here to protect you. Any personal information is just given on a "need to know" basis, you know. Okay, so, what do you need to know? Well, I need to know where you're going and what you're doing. End of list. Needed to know, you're leaving after tomorrow, remember? Or maybe you're just saying that 'cause... you miss your family this Christmas instead of having to be forced to be with mine. No, that's, that's not it. I, I don't have that... what you have. So, what would you be doing if you weren't here? I don't know, ah, watching... watching a movie, eating Chinese food. - Reading a book. - All by yourself? Well, I can't have that. No, not when there's a perfectly perfect Rodriguez family Christmas, yours for the taking. You can't replace me and keep up your lie. That's why you want me to stay for your perfectly perfect Rodriguez Christmas, hm? Hm, nothing gets past you. Not much. No, really, we have a great time. And so would you if you would stop being a stickler and enjoyed yourself for five minutes. Alright. I'll stay. But only because I don't want the record company to think I can't hack it. Not because, you know, I want to... sit by the fire and sing "Jingle Bells". Ha... Don't worry... We don't do that anymore. Hey, can I just say, thank you for going along with this? For going along with what, Mija? Sleeping on the sofa bed, Abuela. Not ideal. No, no, lo siento, Matt, but if we had known you were coming, we would have been more prepared. It's perfect, thank you. Hasta luego. - Buenas noches. - Buenas noches. - Oh, I like him. - Oh? Oh! Muy bien muchacho. He's a good person. I can feel it right in my heart. - And I'm never wrong. - Oh, no? No, never. Ah! Oh, I hope I didn't wake you. I was trying to be quiet, but... I just couldn't skip a day. It's a routine! No, it's fine. Hey, you want to join me? Maybe after I get some coffee. Okay. Hill climb, Lance Armstrong! - Abuela! - Ah! Hola. I hope Joaquin didn't wake you. His routine, he thinks he's going to be Iron Man. Oh, yeah... No, it's, it's fine. So, what's going on here? Oh, prep for the living nativity. I think this is going to fit fine. Ah, yes, we decided... you're going to be a wise man. - Arm in. - A, a what? Yeah, bring it in. Let's see, here, arm here. Let's not rip this fine work Mommy has done. - And what do we think? - Oh, it's your color! Wow. - Okay, this is... - It looks good. Is this one of the Christmas traditions I'm supposed to be embracing? It is. Por supuesto. But don't worry, all you have to do is hold some frankincense and follow along with the rest, right? Exactamente. Okay, and you are... Mary? Great guess, but no, this year I've been replaced by Faith. And that's what we call typecasting. - Got it. - Show biz. Ah, can I chat with you for a second? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. Look, I have to, I have to walk down to the town square. And check out in daylight exactly how much you're gonna be exposed on stage. - Exposed? - Yeah, so... Just stay with your family while I'm gone. And, look at me- don't leave the house. I won't go anywhere. I will be at the house making sure that your costume fits, okay? - How's that sound? - That's great news. - See you in a bit. - Okay. Okay. Jaylen! Jaylen! Ah! Can you go get Jaylen?! Where's Jaylen? Hi! Can you get Jaylen? Come back tonight for Nacimiento. She'll take a selfie with you. Now go home! Go, get out of here! You too, man, get out of here! Detroit, Miami, New Orleans, all sold out. Stop it! Already? It is all happening, take this in. This is your time. You're right, and I am, Benny, but- I don't want to sound ungrateful here, but you know I want to perform as me. My songs, my voice. English and Spanish, remember? And you will, eventually, but for right now, I want you to enjoy Christmas, and you let me take care of the rest, okay? Eyes on the prize. We're going to Miami! Feliz Navidad, Benny. Merry Christmas to you! Matt? I'm not coming out. Come on, Matt, it's time. I can't wear this. Come on, I'm not gonna laugh at you. I'm coming... Okay, maybe I'm gonna laugh a little, but only 'cause you look so good. Alright, don't you patronize me. - I look ridiculous! - It's gonna be fine. This is the weirdest assignment I've ever had. Now remind me again why I agreed to do this? 'Cause you're getting paid, ding! Not nearly enough. Well, then, I'll put in a good word with the label, okay? Now come on, Frankincense, it's show time. Hm... - Hm, looking so good! - Okay... Can you, ah, come help me carry some groceries from my truck? Sure. Thanks, man. I got these. Another one. Same handwriting. I found one of these notes at the bar last night. Also unsigned. This one was on the porch today, but I figured it was from one of the lookie-loo's camped out outside. No, I don't think so. You think it's something to worry about? No, no, I... It's probably just fan mail, you know. That's the gig, she's a big star now. La Cobaya is a star. Not sure I'll ever get used to that. But I don't think we should tell her about the notes. I don't want to worry her or Abuela. No, this is just between you and me. Okay? I promise you, Hector, nothing's gonna happen to her. Not on my watch, okay? Now that's the attitude I was looking for. Yeah? And the wise men came from the East, followed by the star that led them to Bethlehem. To the manger. We are the three wise men. And we come bearing gifts for the baby Jesus. And we come bearing gifts... Oh, oh, yeah. Got something for ya. Ah! Faith, you can stop, the baby Jesus was born already. - Is it happening again? - Is what happening? Worse than before? She was having contractions the other night, but they said they were Braxton Hicks, and sent us home. Do we go back? Do we wait? Do we stay? - Do we go? - Ah! Okay, you take her to the hospital. I don't think you want to have a baby in a cold manger, this day and age, would you? No. Maybe I should have let you play Mary, after... all! I'm sorry, folks, the show is over. Thankfully, the baby Jesus has arrived, so let us celebrate this baby while we await the arrival of our grand-baby! - Yeah! - Please, come join us. I'll be in touch as soon as we know what's going on. We're praying, Mijo. I'm gonna be a tia! Really nice wings you had there. So sorry to interrupt. I just got a text. Tyler Huston just arrived. We're gonna start rehearsing the opening number tomorrow. Ah, that's the tamalada. I can't miss that, Abuela would kill me. Ah, what is a tamalada? And, where is this rehearsal taking place? I gotta, gotta check out the space first. Relax. I'm not the president, Matt. And I'm sure the studio is clean. And a tamalada is a very important Christmas tradition in my culture. You know what, we can rehearse from 9 to 12. - Okay. - Oh... And the label sent over the new songs. - Uh-huh? - They're... good-ish. So, I'm just a manufactured pop star with no discernible personality, got it. No, don't think anyone believes that. Oh, sorry, I gotta take this. Okay. Hello? Hey, you have a minute? I've been following your career on social. Nice mini mansion, by the way. It sure beats Squirrel Hollow. Hey, how do you know she has a mini mansion? Dude, can we have a minute? Yeah, sure, go ahead. Look, I've been meaning to reach out, but I didn't know what to say, Jay. I do know why you didn't want me to come to LA though. All I wanted was for you to show up, and you didn't. That wasn't gonna change just because our address did. I know. Look, I wasn't very good with the love, and the flowers, and the poetry thing, but I'm trying to be better. Be better how? By writing notes or something? Come on, man. Look, I know I'm too late, and I regret what happened to us. But you and I work together, Jay. I mean it. Tonight's about family, Eddie. But, thank you. Thank you for coming. Alright, okay. Have a good night. It's a girl! Her name is Luisa, after Abuela! Ah! - Vamos al hospital! - Vamos! I feel so honored! Felicidades! Another reason for you to come home. - Yeah. - Your first niece. Then, you can watch her grow up. A family needs to stick together. Mhm, yeah. I'm gonna be coming back as much as I can. It won't be enough. I don't see why you can't be here and there. Because I'll be on tour. I'll be multi-coastal. So, it's important to enjoy the here and now, Abuelita. Of course, of course. Well, buenas noches. Good night... good night! Feliz Navidad. Feliz Navidad. Oh, you're sweet. Vamos, be back. Wow. I know this girl. I really see, you love all this. This is how we connect with each other, you know? Through music, and cultural traditions, and... Ah, we get to tell stories and make memories that we're gonna be laughing at forever. Come on, you have to have enjoyed it a little. Ah... yeah, I, you know, I prefer to be a spectator. You were a phenomenal wise man. Ah, okay, phenomenal is a stretch. Really, ah... it was more exceptional. Okay, so you're funny sometimes. Sure, maybe. I know, my family's not perfect and, no one's is, and... Ultimately, when you find the people that let you be you... So, why don't they let you be you in your career? Well, sometimes family and... record label, and the public, even, they... they think they can decide who you are. And, you have to live up to their expectations. So, I do as I'm told. Yeah. Look, let me say this. In the Navy, when we wanted to... accomplish a task... we would... plot, plan... and execute. I, personally, wouldn't outsource something important as, say, trying to get an executive at a label to listen to my songs. No. No, you, you wouldn't, you would... plot, plan, and execute, right? And, you're stuck with me and, hey, you wouldn't want me to tell the label that you couldn't execute it. Okay. Well... I'm here. But... you are not getting me in another costume. Come on, you're warming up! 5, 6, 7, 8! And here's the best part, you're singing, you're singing your heart out, the fan's on warp speed, the cape you're wearing is blowing through the wind. Your hair is whipping around, "ch-ch". And, ha! You're a goddess. You're a Greek goddess. Then the other dancers come in, and here is the lift. The goddess is lifted up, up in the air, her arms are open, taking in all the adoration- Yeah, that, that's great, but it's not gonna work. It needs to be me. You know, I'm a Rodriguez. I want to represent for mi gente. Your people. Let, let me speak your language. - Okay. - Cumbias. - Cumbia, si. - Si, salsa. Ah, da... Eh, eh! Or some... Yes, okay, oh, okay, okay, okay. -Okay, let me find a song- -You know, something just, ah! And, let's see that. - Yes, yes! - Yes! Ah! Uh-huh. There we go, there we go. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, so you know some of this? Okay. Ah, yes! Yes! - Eh! - Yes! - Ha! - Yes, thank you! - Isn't that fun? - I love it. It's great! Big guy, why don't you come over here? What? What? I want to see something, help me out here, come on. Stand right over here, okay. Follow me. Right hand up, your left hand's gonna grab onto her hand, there we go. You're gonna- - Like, this? - Yeah, like that. Oh... okay. Cool. So, I'm gonna count you guys down, and you're gonna move your body... into his body, and you're gonna pull her in. Ready? 5, 6, 7, 8. Oh, ah! Don't worry, I gotcha. I know. - Woo! - Hey! So, you do know some of this. Yes! I think Christina Aguilera did that act 20 years ago... Not very modern. But, in the vein of plot, plan, and execute, I've come up with an idea. I don't need to wait on Benny. I can email the songs over, myself. - I like it. - Yeah? Yeah. You know, another thing I learned in the military... loudest voice usually wins. Hm? That guy. What, you know him? He showed up at my house back in LA. I can't believe he followed me here. He's relentless. Yeah, paparazzi always are, come on. For those of you who've never done tamalada- Matt-tamalada is a Mexican holiday tradition, and everyone has a role. Matt and Jaylen, you are the corn husk handlers. You remove them from the water and dry them. Joaquin and Camila, you spread the masa on the husk... evenly! Mm, then hand them to me. I put the filling, fold and steam. Is everyone clear on their role? Si jefa. Perfecto. Now... We have hundreds to make. Hundreds? Is she serious? I do not joke when it comes to tamaladas. This is for the neighbors. And this year is going to be as good as ever. And, let's begin! Oh, wow! You're a dad now, Hec. I know, I can hardly believe it. - And she's perfect, Jay. - I can't wait to meet her. Another day or so she'll be out of the NICU and can have visitors. And then, maybe, you and Faith can think about getting your own place. You think Mamá and Papi and Abuela are gonna let us move now that there's a baby in the mix? Okay, fair point. Plus, you can't beat built-in babysitting. Also true. - Are you happy? - Most of the time. I'm happy right now. See? Everything is better when we're all together. Or maybe, it's because of Matt. I don't know... Maybe... I don't know, you think so? Hey, I just came down to sneak one in. Don't, don't tell on me? Welcome to the cone of tamal silence. Mhm. Alright, I have to get back to the hospital. Faith is expecting these tamales to be there when she wakes up. Send her our love, and please... - Send besitos to baby Luisa. - Okay. Buenas noches, brother. - Te llamo. - Te llamo. - See you. - See you, man. So, what do you do, when you plot, plan and execute, and all you get from the label is an auto-reply that the label, "doesn't accept unsolicited material"? They didn't even know it was from one of their artists. Hm... Well, I would say, in... in combat, never give up. This is hardly combat. You know, in the Navy, we have a saying. Semper Fortis. "Always courageous." And that's the kind of person that I want to be, Matt. You know, someone who isn't afraid to go against the grain, but... I feel like everyone is trying to hold me back. You know, we... shouldn't make ourselves small so that people will feel comfortable. Just be bold. Be brave, be courageous. Semper Fortis, hm? Why is it that... I can stand up to you, but I... everyone else, I just... let them call the shots, no arguments? Well, because I'm on the job. You know, my... My role in your life has an end date. I don't think my family would let that happen. You're a Rodriguez now whether you like it or not. You know, I kind of like the sound of that. You seemed to have a lot of fun last night. Oh, I did. I could bathe in Abuela's tamales. How did I not know that this is a Christmas thing? Oh, well, you've never dated a Mexican-American girl. Well, fake dated a Mexican-American girl. But you're definitely getting a taste of what it's like in our world. You know, I know your family makes you crazy, Jaylen, but... You're lucky. I know that I am. I must sound so ungrateful to you, Matt, I'm so sorry. No, no, no, no, it's okay. I'm, I'm fine being on my own. You know, we, we do what we know. But I can also see that box you've been put in. And I don't think that's fair to you. Yet I do what's expected of me. Yeah, but you didn't do that at the audition. And you won. What was different then? I don't think any of us thought I was gonna win. Not that they didn't believe in me, but... The odds weren't in my favor. The only person who thought I had a shot was... Lorelei. It was how she convinced me to go with her. Wow, you went because of Lorelei? She gave me the confidence to join her. And my life hasn't been the same since. You can do it again. With your family, with the label, right now. Plot, plan, execute. - No fear. - Semper Fortis. Yes! - That's my girl. - Thank you. I miss singing with you, Mija. Here at the piano. In church. I know, I do too. You know... When I was a girl... I wanted to be a singer, just like you. Then, I met Abuelo. Abuela, you would have been amazing! No, it was a very short time in my life. There weren't enough opportunities for girls like me, my age, in Mexico, or anywhere else. People will like to take advantage of the young and naive, who were looking for a better life. Abuela, I can't imagine you ever being naive. Ah, well, that is because my papi told it to me straight. And you, you taught me. So, you don't have to worry about me. My love of music comes from you. But sometimes, we have to leave home, to find greatness. Like you and Abuelo did, you know? But knowing you are out there, all alone. I am not all alone, okay? I have- Matt, I know, of course. I'm happy you found him. Yeah, I feel like... Like Matt really sees me. Mi papa, used to say... "Find a man who will jump in front of a moving train to save you." I found that in Abuelo. You and Abuelo had a love for the ages. Ah, I'm not sure how Matt feels about me. It's very clear he will jump in front of a train for you! There's a reason for that. That's because my boyfriend is totally a good guy. But he... He has some walls up. Some hearts are harder to reach than others. But I believe his already belongs to you. - Hey. - Hi. I just came home to get Faith's book, and I found this. Why is this person going to so much trouble to not sign these? I don't know, Hector. But this is her life now. And I won't let anyone get near her, okay. Hm, I'm sad to miss Luminarias tonight. But, as long as Faith and the baby are in the hospital, I'll stay there with them. Understood. Hey, what is Luminarias, anyway? You'll see. That is this family's answer to everything. Yes, it is. So, what do you think of Squirrel Hollow? I think this town and your family are wonderful, but... I think the sooner we get out of here and go back to LA, the better. What happens when we get back? I don't know, I guess that's up to the label. So, your assignment's done and you never see me again, is that what you're saying? No, no, that's not what I said. Do you want to keep seeing me? Ah, do you? Don't deflect, I asked you first. Listen, I'm not, I'm not deflecting. Just... I don't think it'd be professional for me to answer that. Oh, come on, this hasn't been professional since you put on a wise man costume. That was pretty much forced on me. You don't have to pretend with me. Jaylen, I'm not... That's all I've been doing, all day and all night, is just pretending in front of your family. Then stop pretending, and tell me what you're thinking. I'm thinking... What? Say it. Why aren't you saying anything? Okay, I got that loud and clear. Good. Ah... Let's go get some pies, huh? Yeah, let's do that. We place luminarias along the walkway, as they were thought to be a guide to help Mary and Joseph find their way home. And then, we make a wish. Abuelo believed that as they burn, they put our wishes out into the sky, and then... they come true. One of my last luminarias was right before I left for the LA audition so, you want to think long and hard about what you're putting out there. I don't have to think about it. I already have mine. For Hector, and Faith, and the baby. It's up to the fates. No, Papi. It's up to us. I know what to do. I have a plot to plan and execute. It's gonna work just fine. Vamos! Whatever it is, count me in. - Yeah? - Yeah. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen, if I can have your attention. We're ready to begin. We're all set. Two press outlets are here. This is a great idea, Jay. And it's gonna work. Welcome to Squirrel Hollow's tree lighting ceremony. We are so happy to have you here tonight. And a special thank you to Straight Talk wireless for generously sponsoring this event, as well as Jaylen's upcoming tour. Now, I have some airtime cards that I will be passing out a little later, also courtesy of Straight Talk. And, it is my... honor, on behalf of this town, to welcome up our Grand Marshall... Jaylen Rodriguez, let's light this tree, yeah! Thank you so much for entrusting me with this honor, and letting me be a part of this, in the place where... I can always be me. And I wouldn't be where I am today if it weren't for one person, who needs to help me light this Christmas tree. Lorelei? In life, you are lucky if you have one friend who believes in you. And for me, that was Lorelei. I never thanked you for your encouragement. For getting me on that bus. And I should've. Will you light this tree with me? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yes! - Let's do this! - Ready? - You. Alright, okay. You have a song that is- and I quote- "The real Jaylen Rodriguez"? - Woo! - Ow! - Is that rumor true? - That's right! We all have to be who we are, and you all are going to get a taste of the authentic me. Mi gente! Vamos! Eh, mi gente! Jaylen! - Jaylen! - Hey, what are you grabbing? What were you reaching for, huh? -What- -It was a poem! Probably a bad one, but she likes that sort of thing, so I tried. Look, sorry, sorry, everyone, false alarm! Continue on. Feliz Navidad! Merry Christmas! So it was you? Why didn't you sign it? 'Cause you were always there. I didn't want you coming after me. She knows my handwriting. Though, clearly, they all got intercepted 'cause she never responded. Sorry, man. Just... - Yeah. - Do you mind? No. Jaylen... Great show. - Honestly. - Thank you, Eddie. Bye. - We did it. - That was really nice. Excuse me, excuse me, so sorry to interrupt. - Uh-huh? - It's Benny. He sounds upset. Jay, what did you do? I didn't want to tell you because I knew you would talk me out of it. Yeah, you know what, I would have talked you out of it because it was crazy. But you know what, it worked. What are you saying? I am talking about, Barb called me and asked me why you're not singing songs in English and Spanish. They really didn't listen to my music, did they? I should have pushed harder. I didn't do my job right, and you did my job better than I do my job. And you know what, I really don't like that, but I'm very, very proud of you. It's blowing up all over the internet. Yeah, Barb and her team are gonna be listening to your songs on Monday. That's great news, Benny. Well, you did this, you made this happen! I've been doing this job for, what, for 20 years, but I guess there's a few things I still have to learn how to do, you know. Hey, Daddy's on the phone! Stop screaming! Why do people scream in this house, Jay? Merry Christmas, Benny. Merry Christmas, Jay, I'll see you when you get back. Okay. The label loved it. - Ah! - We did it! - I knew it, I knew it. - Thank you! I knew it. - What happened? - We did it, we did it! - So proud of you. - Thank you! There's the superstar! Hector! Sneaking around like Santa Claus. Presents for everyone, from Luisa. Aw! Passed out on her mama right now, like a Christmas miracle. Oh, I can't wait to see what she got me. I hope it's a blender, a new blender. What about chocolate caliente? - Si, por favor! - I'm gonna get some of that. Jay, Camila! You missed all the excitement. I know, I saw it, yo, Jay was amazing. Everybody's talking about it. She went back to her roots. I'm talking about what happened off camera. Another? What does that make, like four? It was Eddie. I should have known. At least we know she's not in danger anymore. Was I in danger? I was getting notes and you two didn't think I should know about it? Don't be mad at him. It was my idea. We, we didn't want to worry you. Worry her about what? Apparently, I was receiving letters, which was concerning to them. Why wouldn't you say something? We could have called the Sheriff. No, it was nothing like that, Mamá. What? You didn't think I could handle it? You thought I wasn't strong enough? You thought I would crumble? You're just like the rest of them, Matt. Zero faith in me, whatsoever. - Jaylen... - No, it's not true. We have all the faith in you, Mija. We just worry. We can love each other and let go at the same time... We have to give each other the space to grow. I was fine before you came along. And I didn't need you then and I don't need you now. That is not a good way to talk to your boyfriend, Jay. He's not my boyfriend, Papi! Matt and I aren't a couple. He's a bodyguard, hired by the record company. And I didn't want to tell you all anything because I didn't want it to be more than it was. So, Matt, nothing...? None of this was true? Everything I told you was real. Why would you lie to us, Jay? Because I'm doing what I love. But all I hear is, "Come home where we can protect you." But you need to trust that I know what's best for me. And that I need to live for me. No, no... Maybe we did go too far with our worry. But, what about, what about the lying? And the whole elaborate charade? That is not who we are, Jaylen. I thought you really saw me. I do. No, you just fed into it, like the rest of them. So, maybe it's me that... doesn't really know you. I need to clear my head, I'm gonna... go on a walk, alone. 'Cause I'm gonna take care of myself from now on. her king. Jaylen... I thought I'd find you here. I need to thank you, for tonight. You don't have to thank me. No, I do. And, I need to apologize. It's just, when I got cut from Pop Star, it was like a punch to the gut. Just... watching you achieve it all is... I know that must have been hard. But even worse than that, I let my pride get in the way of our friendship. But you know... Pop Star USA isn't the only way to a singing career. It's one path out of a million. Everything always came so easily to me, I just expected it to continue. You know, small fish, big pond... drowns in ocean. Well, you do have a friend in LA with some connections, if you ever want to swim there again. You're so talented, Lorelei. Do not give up on yourself. If you're willing to give it another go... Merry Christmas. Feliz Navidad. Hi, can I get a beer, please? Thank you. This drink is on me. This was all my fault. Well, what can I say? We Rodriguez's love hard. Look, I'm not a Rodriguez. I'm just the hired help. And I know better not to get emotionally involved. Oh, wah-wah, poor you. This family welcomed you, with open arms, and you became a Rodriguez whether you liked it or not. You know... Just for a minute... I got to feel what it was like to be a part of something that... that wasn't temporary. Yeah, I know this was a job and you were putting on a show, but I know a thing or two about people. And, you're not that good of an actor. Well, thanks for the compliment. All of this was real for you. Maybe. But then, I underestimated her. So, did I. All her life, and she still loves me. Go to her! It's not that simple. You know what? I need your help with something. You game? Ah, what do we have here? Baby Luisa. Another for baby Luisa. Otro mas para baby Luisa. Jaylen, para ti. And, baby Luisa. How much is this gonna set me back? Aye! It's our first grandchild and I'm going to spoil her rotten, and you're going to accept that. Understood. Where is he going? It's time to open presents. Yeah, I have something to say, and I'll, I'll tell Hector when he gets back in. Before we go further, um... I'm sorry. I will never lie to you again. But I need something from all of you. I am no longer Jay-Jay, La Cobaya. I am not a baby, and... I don't need saving. I want to be completely honest with you, but I... I need the space to be able to do that. Mija. I'm sorry. I put my past experience on you. My story is not your story. It's not. And if I stumble and fall, I will pick myself up. Mhm, and we will be there for you. Always. Gracias. There are still gifts to open. This one is for Matt. Oh, I haven't seen him yet this morning. Well, I'm sure you two will find a way to work things out. He cares very much for you, you know. That was clear to all of us. I know... I know. I always known, right here. That's nice. And yay, though this wise man was alone... without his trusting companions... he traveled far and wide, searching high and low, for the family he only dreamed of. And followed the star that led him home. Of course, this star was a pop star. And this wise man, well, he spent his life... being not so wise. Until love changed him. And now, he arrives... bearing gifts. Well, at least one gift. Is it frankincense? No, no, I can't stand the smell of that stuff. Good, me neither. Why don't we leave you two to talk, alone? I'm okay, I'll stay here. - Mama, vamanos. - Okay... You stay there, you talk. We will be inside if you need us. Just, just call. Call me if you need. Open it. A place for your songs. Now I, I know I don't know how to be a part of a family, but... you all make it so effortless. Are you sure you want that? I know we're a lot. I know, you're a lot. But I'm sure. I'm sorry to make you go along with the lie. I was wrong to put you in that position. But no more. We're all about the truth now. Well, if I'm still welcome... I'd like to be a part of it all. Yeah? Yeah. I'm gonna kiss you right now. In front of this giant, ridiculous manger. And in front of the entire Rodriguez family, watching us from the living room window. Feliz Navidad!
