In the beginning of this century, in the early 1900s... a German scientist visited Brazil to collect the natives ' f olktales. When M?rio de Andrade, a great Brazilian writer, read those tales... he became, in his own words, ''lyrically moved and desperate''... because he realized that Brazilian popular culture... ever so satirical, funny and even subversive... towards hypocritical moral standards... that many times were predominant throughout our history... basically preserved the spirit, stories and even characters... created by Native Brazilians centuries bef ore. That was the seed of "Macuna?ma", a book which he wrote in a week. Based on that book, I directed the movie you are about to see. I hope the Brazilian adventures of Macuna?ma, a hero of our people... will entertain you and also make you think. Deepinthejungle... silencebecamesothick... hearingtheflowof theUraricoerathat... That 's it. He 's born. It 's a boy, mother. Look at him. What a beauty. God, he 's ugly! You 're no beauty yourself. Don 't cry, brother. Ugliness means nothing. Won 't he have a name? Macunaima.

Yes, mother. Bless me, mother. Good morning, sweetheart. This is no time to wake up. What are you doing? A trap to catch piglets. And you think there are piglets here? I saw a fresh trail by the termites ' nest. - Gimme a piece of rope. - What f or? I want to make a trap too. This is not f or little boys. Are you crying, sweetheart? - No, I'm not. - Don 't you want to speak with me? - No. - Why? Jigue won 't give me a piece of rope. He 's right. You could hang yourself. Ignorant! Sofara!

Sofara helped me, but the idea was mine. Jigue put his trap where the tracks started. I knew the piglet would come back. I put mine where they broke of f. It would have to pass mine first. And it did. I got it... Jigue is still waiting. You first, mother. What about me? - But... the entrails? - It 's good enough f or you. I caught it, and all I get are the entrails!

It was right here in this catfish. I had it stuf fed, but it didn 't come out so good. Wretched! When I bit its belly... I felt the stone. Hard. I almost broke a tooth. Artificial. Didn 't you clean the fish? I don 't clean anything. I have no time. Wretched. I eat raw fish. I eat it the way it is. And stop arguing. Here 's the stone and here is the fish, f or those who don 't believe me. Any poor worker could have f ound it. But I was the lucky man. The muiraquitan is a good-luck stone. I became rich. And since money brings luck, I became very rich. Look! All that equipment is new. American... Second-hand. Come here, boy! If you only knew how this charm worked! Get out of my way.

The defense of our property, our savings... the mortality of our children... the faithfulness of our wives... against the danger of a penetration in our homes... of exotic and equivocal ideologies... against the atheism of the atheists... our tradition... and the administrative improbity... that only brought disgrace to our Brazil. - It 's not true! - Shut up, you punk! Gentlemen, the Southern Cross is the most sublime symbol... - It 's not! - It isn 't! The Southern Cross is the most sublime symbol... - No, it 's not! - Put him down! Come on, man!

Those f our stars up there... invisible now, because it 's daytime... have nothing to do with it. Believe me. The plagues which af flict Brazil... are not the ones this mulatto here has mentioned. Now that you 're white, do you turn racist? The plagues of Brazil are the cof fee parasites... the caterpillar, soccer, the pium mosquito... the murizoca mosquito, the vareja fly and others. And bad cows, because only the good ones give milk. The bad ones, only when they feel like it. It 's also erysipelas, smallpox, bellyaches... chafes, yellow fever... and a damn awful giant... Wenceslau Pietro Pietra, who stole my muiraquitan. My friends! Poor health and too many ants... the plagues of Brazil are. Subversive! - Commie! - Subversive! He should be in jail! In jail! Call the Police! - You 're under arrest. - Why? Suspicious attitude. You were running away. You don 't understand. It 's the opposite. - I was running af ter a boar. - A boar? Yes, a boar. Haven 't you seen it? A boar coming from 0uvidor Street! What boar! Let 's lynch him! - He said he saw it. - There 's no boar here! Look at the trail of the boar! A boar here in the middle of the city! Unbelievable, no? Look at its trail! It 's fresh. What do those strange words mean? Nothing. They don 't mean anything. You 're making fun of us. Where 's that trail? Relax! Relax! I didn 't say there is a trail. I said there was one. But not anymore. Now excuse me. Wait a minute! While we kill ourselves working... a Nobody makes us waste time looking f or... a boar which doesn 't exist. I didn 't ask anybody to look f or a boar. Those two asked you to. - Second, who is a Nobody? - You. There you 're mistaken. And you don 't scare me, neither of you. If I lose my temper, I'll put it all down! Let 's lynch him! Lynch those two. I'm on my way. My little sweetheart, you 'Il recover very soon. Nothing like a hot f ootbath to cure a cold. My poor little darling. How is that? You sleep all dressed up? Poor darling! He was cold. You should have called me. Try one f oot, but it 's hot. Now the other one. Are you feeling better? Had you listened to me, that wouldn 't have happened. It 's hot, but it 's good. Leave me alone! You don 't get it. A white man who runs is a champion. If he 's black, he 's a thief. You ran; they beat you up... and you spent the night in prison. Serves you right! 0Id people should stay at home. - Go to hell! - Go in, old fart! Your place is in a cemetery. Don 't brood! It 's bad f or your health. What did you see yesterday in the middle of the city? - Middle of what? - Go on! Speak up! - What did you see? - A boar? You know very well it 's not true. I've lied! And why did you lie, sweetheart?

Good af ternoon, lady. Is Wenceslau at home? He went to Europe to recover from a beating. But his wife Ceuici is here... with the little daughter and the big one. Do you happen to know... if he took a stone along with him, hanging from his neck? I don 't know, but if you want... to spend the night in my room... you can search the safe while his wife is asleep. Funny this room of yours! I like it all right. What 's your name? Jigue. You were so absent-minded. I've problems... responsibilities. Good night, madam. See, I was f ollowing a bird.

This hurts, hurts, hurts! Mother, what shall we eat today? Pluck him while I prepare the sauce. What a beauty! How did you catch him? With a net. Put some salt in the saucepan. I'm bored... you know? So I'll be nice to you. If you answer my questions, I'll let you go. Where do the girls have the kinkiest hair? - In Africa. - Right. Now a harder one. Where do we have hair against hair... and a bald one inside? You 're shameless, aren 't you? It 's our eye. When we sleep, our eyebrows join. I'll take you into my room. Give me my dinner back, or I'll throw you out. Quick, bef ore she breaks the door down. Quick what? Pardon me, but I can 't do it that quickly. It makes me nervous. Some other time. You lost your pants. I've been robbed by a Turk. I lost our money... 30,000. Jigue hasn 't come home yet? - Maybe he has money. - No, he 's broken. And there 's more. The giant went to Europe with the stone. And now? I don 't know. It 's your fault. Did you think he would wait f or you? God gives nuts to those with no teeth. I want you to know Suzy. Here 's our hammock. Strip and stretch out. The rest is up to me. That 's it! I've f ound the solution. You say you 're an art student, you apply f or a scholarship... in Europe! Why not?

If you don 't believe me, don 't ask. - Are they good? - Taste. It is good. Have some more? It 's finished. I only had two. Yours should be good too. Eat 'em up. Doesn 't it hurt? No. It 's pleasant. Will you have the courage? Have a look. Sic transit... Are you feeling better, sweetheart? God, help him to get better. He could have died, or worse. Did you notice his voice has changed? - What 's the problem? - Better change... Let Suzy massage me. I'll teach her another one. You wait outside. - Funny! I feel a pain here. - Could it be? - Macunaima, may we come in? - Not yet. His voice is back to normal. - Do you see anything? - It 's covered. Macunaima, open up! You may come in. Sensational!
