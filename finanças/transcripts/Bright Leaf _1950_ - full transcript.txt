Major Singleton. Major Singleton isn't home this afternoon. Does you desire to enter? Guess you're going in? Not yet, boy. I ain't allowed. Major Singleton will skin me for sure. * Saturday market day.. ** - Howdy. - Hi. Nice animal. He'll need currying and some feet. Say, don't I know you from some place? I've never been there. 'Brenda, Frieda, honey. I'll be back in a minute.' 'This one..' Say, I couldn't be wrong, could I? It's six, seven years, but ain't you.. There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight or I ain't the corn drinking fool I am. You know who that was? Brant Royle. Say, ain't you the fella... Where's Calhoun's office? - Lawyer Calhoun? - Yeah. He's in the cotton and mercantile building down the street a piece, at the corner of.. I'll reckon you remember. Send a boy out and tell him I'm here. I'm sorry. - I'm going out. - Brant Royle. Who would've thought he'd ever come back? I'm going out. That is, I won't be here. I expect to be back early, before dinner, if I can. And I think I can. Oh, if anyone asks, Ill be at Major Singleton's. What, Mr. Barton? I'm going out. - Oh. - Yes. Brant Royle.. Careful over there, now. Come in. You're Calhoun. It's been a long time. But I recognized you, Brant. You favor your pa a lot. I'm right glad to see you back. You're no more glad than I am to see you. Really, now, Brant. I declare. You wrote me about my uncle dying. I came immediately. Well, son, he left everything to you. That is, the cigarette factory. 'What became of the rest?' The warehouses, well, your uncle lost them. Major Singleton took them over right after.. Right after he ran me and my father out of town. You're not fixing to get upset. Coming into town, I stopped at my father's place. Nobody's lived there since we got kicked out by the look of it. Singleton didn't really want the place. He hasn't used it. Nobody's been farming it. He was set on getting rid of the Royle's, it appeared like. Me, in particular. We all felt pretty bad about your trouble. Yeah, I bet you cried hour after hour. That's enough. My father worked that land up from nothing. Sweated over it 14, 15 hours a day. I know because I used to help him. Nobody in the whole valley grew better bright leaf tobacco. Then just when it started to pay off the major stepped in. It was a nice little farm once. Here. Keep the change. Brant, I hope you don't blame any of what happened on me. I know exactly who to blame. I'd do the same thing to him. Maybe more. Well, I wont intrude on you any longer. You can look over these statements. And here are the keys to the factory. Is the factory worth anything at all? Well, it's pretty run down. A couple of thousand, maybe. Sell it, I need the money. Well, that might not be so easy. Singleton again? That's about the size of it. Well, I've gotta be getting back. Hope everything else is alright with you. How'd you leave the family? I heard your pa was poorly. - Not anymore. - That's a blessing. - Glad to hear he's recovered. - He's dead. I hadn't heard. Your father gone, now your uncle? Why, that leave only.. Only me. Yeah. Well, good luck. Come one, come all to the free show. See the mysteries of the Orient. See the giant fire eater of the Oronoco. It's entertaining, thrilling and an education for men, women and children. 'Twelve exciting acts, twelve.' 'Free, it's all free.' Brant. Mademoiselle Sonia, come back. Come back. You cannot be seen like this. Get me a pencil, my pocket book. Hurry. - Fauntleroy. Fauntleroy. - Yes, Ms. Sonia? That man who just walked by, go look. The man with the walking stick, Miss Sonia? Yes, I want you to take him a message. - Here. - Yes, ma'am. Hurry up, please. Margaret, isn't that.. Of course, it is. Afternoon, Ms. Singleton. I don't like you hurting his mouth that way. You can let go now. You're welcome, I'm sure. I should've said "Thank you." But I'm able to handle animals without help. Thank you, just the same. - 'Will you let go?' - I guess, you've forgotten me. I guess, maybe I have. 'Is there something special about you?' My name is Royle. We had a farm not far from your place. You used to come and visit me in the fields. I don't remember any such thing. And If I did, I wouldn't expect anybody to refer to it. I was just recalling myself to you. I kissed you. Your father saw. He broke his cane on me. 'Maybe you'll remember now.' Young man, you've been drinking. Why don't you shut up? Oh, I do remember you now. You're that bad mannered, gangly farmer boy that used to pester me. 'The one I used to laugh about so hard.' You're wearing shoes now. And your pants don't need fixing like they always did then. But you haven't changed much otherwise. You have, ma'am. You remind me of your father now. Let go of my horse. Mister? I'm very grateful to you, Major Singleton for the opportunity of coming out here. Your letter said something about an invention. I'm afraid I didn't read it all, to tell you the truth. 'Would you care for some refreshments, Mr. Barton?' No, thank you. I don't believe so. 'In this heat, of course, you will.' - 'It'll cool you off.' - Well, I never touch it, sir. John Barton, cigarette machine? Yes, sir, here are the plans. What's that? What's that? Speak up, speak up. Here are the plans for my cigarette machine. Now I think I can save you a lot of trouble. - I'm not interested. - But.. I'm afraid I don't believe in cigarettes. Much less a machine for making them. It turns my stomach, sir, every time I witness someone poking one of those vile concoctions into their face. I deal in cigars, sir. Nothing less. Let me tell you, for more than a hundred years. Singleton's have been growing, smoking living and thinking tobacco. They were cigar smokers to a man. I'm too old a horse to change my gate. Why don't you at least let me tell you how it works? - Maybe you'd see your mistake. - What's that? Mistake? Uh, if you let me explain how that machine works.. I'm just not interested in a cigarette machine. Uh, I, uh.. Well, speak up, man, don't mumble. I believe I'll have a drink, after all, sir. Well, that's a mighty fine decision. Here we are. No offence meant. It's just that I think you've been sent on a wild goose chase. I don't suppose Mr. Pendleton and the others would be interested. By all means, try them. But I'm afraid we're all cigar men down here. Now, Margaret, it doesn't mean that... Margaret. Margaret, I want you to meet someone. I swear I don't know what's come over her. Get me more smelling salts. I'm gonna need.. James, you've gotta do something, instantly. It's intolerable. - I, oh.. - Tabitha, this is Mr. Barton. Mr. Barton, my cousin, Tabitha Singleton. - How do you do? - Now what's all the fuss? I think I'd better be going, sir. - I'll have Simon drive you. - No, thank you. Oh, to the hotel, at least. - Thank you, I'd rather walk. - Oh, just as you say. Call and see me when you get over this fool notion of yours. Now then, Tabi, what is it? Now, James, you know what the doctor said about getting upset? I'm not upset. I won't have you stirring yourself up like this. He spoke to Margaret but that doesn't mean anything. There's nothing to get excited about. Just like anybody else in town, passing the time of day. I'm sure he didn't mean to be suggestive. It's just that, that uncouth manner of his. Anyhow, there's no point in you flying of the handle. He's back and that's that. We just have to make the best of it. Now I am upset. What are you talking about? Who's back? Brant Royle. We saw him in town. Brant.. 'Margaret.' Come in. What was the extent of your conversation with him? Conversation? With whom, father? There's no need to protect him, I'm referring to Brant Royle. You shouldn't have told him. Well, I.. What did he say to you? He only passed the time of day. - 'It was perfectly harmless.' - Harmless? I don't see why you're getting upset. I've no intention of permitting my daughter to be the object of that man's attentions. I forbid you to ever speak to him again. Don't be so old fashioned father. This is 1894. I'm a modern girl and I'll do what I like. And if what I like happens to be conversing with Brant Royle, that's what I'll do. James, Margaret, please. I'm sorry, father. I didn't mean to upset you. I'm all mixed up, for a fact. I don't wonder. Being accosted on a public thoroughfare by such riff-raff as Royle.. The world is certainly changing. In my day, the man wouldn't have dared. Oh, I don't mind him talking to me. I was just not expecting to see him that gave me such a startle. As a matter of fact it was sort of exciting. I declare, it was. All I could think of was remembering how it felt that time he kissed me. Why, Margaret! The fact that you can talk like this shows I've reason to worry where Brant Royle is concerned. Maybe you have. I don't reckon he's any better than he ought to be. I know a young lady should blush at the very thought of it. But I'll say one thing for Brant Royle. When he looks at me, I know I'm a woman. It isn't my ruffles that charm him or the way I crook my finger when I hold a cup of tea. And you'd be surprised just how much that means to me. What are you going to do? I ran Brant Royle out of town once before. I'm not too old to do it again. Father, don't. I guess Mr. Brant Royle will think twice the next time he feels like passing remarks. You deliberately made trouble. Deliberately. 'Course I did. There hasn't been any excitement around here in months. You're a strange girl. I wish I could understand you. Then I'd do something else so you wouldn't. Undo me, Tab. You can't go on like this. Stirring up trouble just because you're bored. You're never satisfied, never know what you want.. I know what I want. Sure, I do. I wake up at night sometimes with my heart pounding. Listenin', waitin' for something to happen. But everything is so heavy and quiet all around. All you can hear is the dogs barking way off. Suddenly it's gone, whatever it was that woke me up. You really think there'll be trouble in town? Will they fight? - Oh, I wish I could see it. - Margaret. Close that door. Hurry, close it. Excuse me, gentlemen, please. He's on his way down. You wanted to see me? That's a pleasure I could've denied myself. I wish you had. What's on your mind? Only one thing. How long do you intend to remain Kingsmont? I haven't decided yet, have you? Possibly I have. You seem to have prospered somewhat. I own a good horse, a good suit of clothes. I've got $40 in pocket that's more than I had the last time we saw each other. I'm informed so that you're here to settle your uncles estate. May I suggest that you do so as quickly as possible? I don't care much for doing things in a hurry. You need money? Purely in the interest of making your stay with us as brief as possible. I'm willing to buy whatever property your uncle left you. Seems to me every time we have a conversation, it winds up with you inviting me to leave town. If you cross me Royle, I'll make it my personal business to see that you wind up your visit here without a penny. We need some fresh air. It's beginning to stink in here. Thank you. Hello, Major Singleton. The years haven't changed you, Royle. You're still what you've always been. Trash, sir. Common white trash. Too bad you're an old man, Major, or I'd break.. Clumsy fool. Oh, come now, Major, you mustn't loose your dignity. I'm warning you, Royle. Get out and don't come back. I'll leave Kingsmont when I'm ready and not a day before. That makes it twice, Major, this is getting monotonous. Anybody else think it's funny? Bourbon. I'll pour it. Mr. Royle, my name's Barton, John Barton that is. Uh, I couldn't help overhearing uh, seeing that as I was out in the lobby. Mr. Royle, I gather you and Mr. Singleton aren't very friendly. I mean, Major Singleton. I can't get used to the titles everybody.. You see, I'm from Connecticut. Up North, that is. I haven't been here very long.. Uh, what I came down here for.. Mr. Royle.. Suppose I could show you how to make a fortune? Have a drink, Mr. Barton. Thank you. Please excuse my persistence, Mr. Royle. Uh, but this is an invention of mine, I've worked on it up in Connecticut that is. I was born there. And uh... I got into this business and I always figured there must be someway it could work. And there is. Uh, that is, I found it. Doesn't seem possible, I think you're trying to sell something. Yes, sir. A machine for manufacturing cigarettes. Now, wait a minute, you mean you got a machine that'll roll cigarettes? Put the paper on 'em? And package them, too, all in the same operation. Anything like that would make an awful lot of money. How come you haven't been able to peddle it yet? Well, I have to find someone who agrees with my idea well enough to build it, that is. Singletonwouldn't? Singleton won't touch it, nobody else will. I guess everybody does what Singleton does. Looks to me like everybody is afraid to cross him. That's why when I saw you and the major, I.. Whatever else, the Major's supposed to be pretty smart about tobacco. Are the Dukes smart? Reynolds? They've been trying to develop a cigarette machine for a long time. My machine works right now. It'll make cigarettes fast and cheap. How fast and how cheap? 'How much does it cost to hand roll 1000 cigarettes?' You Yankees always answer an important question by askin' one. Ninety cents a thousand, that's what they cost hand rolled. This 15 cents a thousand makes cigarette smoking the cheapest habit in America. And you're looking for somebody with money? - 'Yes, sir.' - To go partners with you. 'Exactly right.' Well, you haven't found him yet. I'm flat on my uppers. How long will it take to build and install one of your machines? Well, if I could get the parts on time and the money, about two months. If I get the money, I want first rights on a partnership basis. 'That's agreeable with me, certainly.' Well, I just might be able to get you the money. You've had enough. 'Please, no applause.' This is a solemn moment, my friends. I bring to you that marvelous boon to mankind. Dr. Monaco's miracle medicine. I'll take some. Well, give the little lady some of the Simon remedy. Thank you, thank you kindly. Gathered by laughing Indonesians in the forest leaves of far off Cathay and brought directly here by camel and caravan to this delightful little city of uh.. Kingsmont. You're the fella. I am the fella who can cure what ails you. Now.. You're the fella that killed my mule. Another satisfied user of Dr. Monaco's miracle medicine. You say your wife was sickly, near death's door till you used the magic potion. Thank you, my friend. Get away. Well, we're lettin' down the bars a little, I see. What you doing back in Kingsmont? Couldn't stay away from you another day. You always meant so much to me. And my grandfather. Brant. I've been waiting all afternoon. Waitin' never killed anybody. Oh, you're still sweet tempered as a July mule. Barton, ma'am. John Barton, that is. You must excuse me. This is Sonia Kovac, my mother. Argh! Delighted, ma'am. Business deal from New England. Oh! Hope I'm not intruding, Mr. Royle insisted. Oh. Uh.. We're having a little party, I'd like you to meet everybody. Mr. business deal. I'm very fond of parties. Very.. Mr. Barton, ladies. - How do you do? - Mr. Barton, my cousin Emily. - How do you do, sir? - Charmed. Over here is my cousin Pearl. - Hey, there. - Charmed. Come, now. Mr. Barton, this is Cousin Louise. - Oh, man. - Charmed. Come on. Cousin Rose. - Hmph! - Charmed. And over here, Mr. Barton, is cousin Theodora. - Just call me Teddy. - Charmed. Come here, Mr. Barton. - This is... - Cousin Arthur. Now, you come right over here and sit down and enjoy yourself. Oh-ho! I declare, Brant. You could've knocked me down with a feather when I saw you. I nearly fainted dead, just like a lady. I would've run after you, but I, I didn't have much clothes on. I, uh, I heard you're doing alright. Say, when did all this happen? Last time I saw you, you didn't have a pot to put flowers in. About three years ago. My mother died and left me the place. I fixed it up and made a rooming house out of it. Mm, some get-up. Latest thing up North. Is that where you've been? They've been teaching me the business at the tobacco exchange in Boston. Learn anything? Come here, I'll show you. I said, come here. If you learned that in Boston, I'm going North. There's nothing like you in Boston. - You still my girl? - Don't bet on it. You think all you have to do is snap your finger at me. All these years, not even a letter. Wasn't anything to write about. I could've been dead. Then what good will a letter be? Where'd you get that? Uh, shaving. Liar! How about Singleton found you sniffing around his daughter again? Been back in town only 10 minutes before you yawling under her window. - Easy, Sonia... - Just the way it used to be. You can't touch her, so you come to me. Like you were using me to forget something. Don't be so modest. Come, you're a good girl. Oh, Brant. You're crazy. Leave me alone. Alright, I'll leave you alone. Pay attention to me, you, you.. Hey, hmm. You've done alright for yourself, carpet-bagger. Or I guess your pa knew what he was doing when he brought you Yankees down from New York, huh? Pittsburgh. You Johnny Rebs ought to get over the idea there's only one city North of the line. You always were smart but I I didn't remember you being so pretty. If I had, I might've written you at that. Don't make fun of me. I love you, Brant. I'm glad you came back. I didn't know where to find you or I would've been there long ago. - Let's not get in an uproar. - I know, I know. I'm not fooling myself. But you're it as far as I'm concerned. When you're a kid you wonder what it's like being in love. Any girl wonders and thinks about it. I stopped thinking when you came along. Now I'm just glad you're back. You going to stay this time? Uh, that depends. On what? Sonia.. Roll me a cigarette the way you used to at my uncles factory. With you breathing down the back of my neck. I remember. Hey. Your father's watch. First present you ever gave me. You deserved it. Still goes slow. Reminds me of you. Well, I get there eventually. How about that coffin nail? You're the best little cigarette girl I ever saw. Still are. Light it. You know, Sonia, one of these days they'll make cigarettes all by machinery. There'll be a fortune in it for anybody smart who gets in early. This town's sound asleep, the whole South's been on its knees ever since the war. Everybody is scared to take hold and make it gold. Except me. You and your uppity notions. A man with guts and a workable cigarette machine could make this valley belch fire. 'Course, it would take money to start. - I said... - Brant. Why did you come here tonight? Be honest. How honest? You want money, don't you? You heard I was making out alright, so you came here to climb aboard the gravy train. Uh, Mr. Business Deal? Yeah. He's invented a cigarette machine. I need money to get it started. It'll make us a fortune. I, uh, I thought I'd ask you first. Sure, why not ask me? I've got it. All you have to do is ask. I won't mind. I haven't got any feelings. Just money. Never mind where it came from or what it makes you for taking it. Just ask me and I'll hand it over. Is that all I mean to you, Brant? Do you know where all this came from? Do you know what it means after working in a cigarette shack? I've given up a lot of things to get this. And I've waited a long time for you to get good and ready to come back. It was worth it, I thought. Hmph! Get out, Brant. Take your business deal with you. Why don't you stop acting like a woman? He killed my mule! Come on, hit him! Bust him one! Stop it, Brant. Hit him, honey. Hit him! Charmed. I don't know how you got my side. Stay there, friend. What's your name? Dr. Monaco. - Should we operate, doc? - Why not? Police! Poli.. The wagon. Boys, beat it. The paddy wagon. You're still a chump. It's none of your business. Anyhow, I haven't decided, yet. Maybe I'll go and maybe I won't. You'll go but he ain't worth it. Well, I can't let him stay in jail. Why not? If a man looked natural in jail on a Sunday morning. Brant Royle's him. Rose. You know a lot about men. My father was one. What would you do? You know how I feel about Brant. I can't help it. What should I do? Well, add it up. He's no good. He never will be any good, he's broke. All he wanted from you is money. If you give it to him he'll throw it away on that cigarette machine. It'll be no good, he'll go away and you'll lose him. Or it'll be a success, then he'll take up with that snip. And you'll lose him. I need another hand. All them things against him. More, even worse. And what can you say about him that's good? I love him. Get into your dress. Thank you, Sonia. It's alright. Uh, what about Barton? Oh! Here. And, and the doctor? Let's not leave anybody behind. Here. You're a good kid, Sonia. Sure. Lovable, that's me. Just like a sister. A rip sister. What's that mean? Means you get what you want as usual. I'll do it, you knew I would. You can have the money for that machine. I want everything in writing. And I'll expect my investment to pay plenty. Oh, Sonia.. Business isn't love, Brant. I never kiss a partner. Ma'am. I consider you a rare gem in the diadem of womanhood. Charming. I see the clear light of freedom, shall we partake? Thank you for your hospitality. Get in, we'll drop you at the hotel. - What day is it? - Sunday. You'll feel better in a week. - I beg your pardon. - Thank you. For a minute, I thought I might have to walk. Many thanks for liberating me from durance vile. In all my odysseys, you shall be remembered. Let's go. You, uh, is your name really Monaco? Christopher Malley. Why? Back there in jail you said something I like. I was talkin' about Royle cigarettes, you said they should be "fit for a king." I like that. I can use it as a slogan. What do you know about tobacco? My particular field of knowledge is the science of extracting blood from turnips. That's all you have to know about tobacco. You want a job? - Seriously, I need a job. - You've got one. You start building that machine. We have the money. "The Royle cigarette company. Fit for a king." "Hurry, hurry, hurry! Come see the Royle cigarette. Fit for a king." They found the trouble here. The first one. 'Look at it, Brant!' We made it, Brant! One for the ages, madam. Try a Royle cigarette. Fit for a king or even a princess. Cures lumps, warts, eliminates hang-nails and makes a pleasure. 'Buy a Royle cigarette, fit for a king.' I know what you're gonna say. Only fast women smoke, but that's not true anymore. So, you needn't start yelling at me. Everybody's doin' it. So why shouldn't I? It's getting to be very fashionable. 'Course, you're so far behind the times you wouldn't know that. Alright, go ahead. Tell me I'm wicked and sinful and lost to mercy. Just because I occasionally do something you men think nothin' of doin' all the time. James. "In God, we trust." Same girl we have on the $10 ones but she's so much prettier in 20. Yeah. We're even now. You paid back everything you borrowed. Anything you get out of your investments now, that is what you've put in, I mean. From now on it's all profit. I'm just crazy about profits. There's something about money that brings out the beast in me. I love it so much I hate to fold it. - We're doin' alright. - We're doing fine. - Here's to us. - Here's to us. To us. This, uh, being a celebration, do you suppose I could kiss you? Not if you have to ask first. Charming. Sold to Royle. It's incredible. Really incredible. Has never been anything like this, never. I don't know what they'll say in Savannah. The board's probably going crazy. Fifteen cents a pound for tobacco. And here, nine, nine.. Hold it, can I get a ten, ten. Hold on, hold on. Sold to Royle. Hold on. Sold to Royle. We're being given over to the hounds and the dogs, sir. We're being ruined by cigarettes. Now, don't wait for me, it's likely to take a while. Just do your shopping, my dear. Be careful, papa. Brant Royle knows what he's doing. But the man's mentally incompetent. This merely proves it. Royle is trying to corner tobacco, sir. He's taking anything at any price. He's bid me down three times. 'Sold to Royle.' Let's see if Mr. Royle can bid me down. We're breaking a lot from the Sado plantations. Select choice, bright leaf and premium dark. What's the highest price that's been paid today? Why, it's an all time record, major. Fifteen cents. Open the bidding on this lot. Uh, gentlemen, what are my bids on this? Twenty five cents. I have 25.. I have 30.. How high are you prepared to go, sir? You'll know when I stop biddin', major. I have 35.. You're done? Sold, Singleton. Brant, those prices you've been paying. I've never interfered with the business end. Don't start now. Get up! You keep this up, Margaret, one of these days I'll get discouraged, or I'll get run over. You saw me coming. If you was going to drive away, that was the time to do it. Not after I got here. How do you know that's what I was up to? Maybe I wanted to talk to you. Maybe I just waited until I was sure you'd notice me and then made out I was going to drive away. So you wouldn't be too sure of yourself. Neither my father nor you can afford those kind of prices for cigar tobacco. I don't make cigars, your father does. Every farmer in a hundred miles from here is home right now or gettin' there as quick as he can. Strippin' his fields to get his tobacco bag here at prices I've been paying before I'm dragged away. That shouldn't be long from now. I'm happy to inform you that by tomorrow I'll come to my senses and they'll be giving tobacco away. All except cigar tobacco, that is. My father won't like you any better for this. That worries me. Tell Mr. Malley to let Major James Singleton buy all the tobacco he wants at this price. Uh, at this price? They say you've become a very dangerous man. Are you dangerous, Mr. Royle? I get what I want, if that's what you call being dangerous. All the time you've been back, it's only the second time I've seen you. Both times, almost by accident. 'Well, you weren't exactly cordial last time we met.' No, I wasn't. I was upset, seeing you again. My father was real upset. He tried to run me out of town. Oh, I'm mighty surprised to hear that. Excuse me, they're getting ready to close inside, Brant. See a delightful shade of purple, take a look at Singleton, no offense, it looks good on him. In a minute. There's something else you might've forgotten, we're going shopping this afternoon and, uh, company's coming. I haven't forgotten. Good afternoon. By the way, I've been a little curious... Uh, excuse me. That girl, the one I saw you with in a carriage is she a friend of yours? That's what he was talking about, alright. - What's her name? - Sonia. Huh, that's a pretty name. She's pretty, too. You like the type. I suppose you do. Is she what he meant by company? It's her birthday next Thursday, I promised to buy her a present. Thursday? Well, that's ballsy. I was gonna say, I just happened to be home Thursday evening. - Oh, but I don't suppose.. - May I call you, Ms. Singleton? I don't want you to disappoint Ms. What's-her-name. Yes, you do. - 8 o'clock. - I'll be looking forward to it. So will I. Now, maybe I'll find out if you're really dangerous. Brant. Started again, has it, you and her? It never stopped. What does that make me? Am I supposed to wait around for you to make up your mind? Louder, there's a couple of people here that don't hear so good, I wouldn't want 'em to miss this. Oh, Brant, Brant, for a smart man, you're such a fool. What you want doesn't exist. That girl isn't real. - You've invented her. - She said you were pretty. If it'd make you think I was honest I'd say she was beautiful. She is beautiful. Am I an old hag of 80? If this is your idea of a pleasant afternoon, you're wrong. Why don't we sell tickets, hmm? I'm just tryin' to find out what makes her so great. - She's a lady. - Ah. No woman who wants something is a lady. If she is, she doesn't get it. - I guess you'd know. - Why, you.. Would you let me finish up? We'll go out and buy you the most expensive present in town. Something with ostrich feathers all over. Ostrich feathers? I'm getting tired of this. I won't take much more. Nobody asked you to. You're a good girl, Sonia, but I never made you any promises. I've always been honest with you, especially about her. Don't ride me for it now. If there's one thing about Brant success hasn't changed him a bit, he's still blind. You're much pretty than all this tobacco around here. They'll wanna auction you off next. I can hear 'em now. * I got blah-blah-blah-blah * Here, may I? - I'll tell you what. - Chris I don't know what to do. I'm losing him. If I ever had him at all, I'm losing him now. I don't know what to do about it. I can't say, " Look at me, I'm the one. I'm what you're looking for." I guess I'm boring you. That's alright, I want you to. Look, what you need is a good laugh. Alright, say something funny. I love you. Oh, you are a fool. I guess I am. Singleton Company will go on dealing in the finest of tobacco and not an ounce of it in cigarettes. I'll see that man running hinges before I change to his kind of business. Major Singleton doesn't receive any. I'm not here to see Major Singleton. - Take these to Ms. Margaret. - Yes sir. I don't recall inviting you, Royle. I'm callin' on Ms. Margaret. You're mistaken, my daughter is not at home to you. - You're not welcome here. - One moment, Royle. While you're here, there's something we can discuss. 'The operations of your company have become troublesome' to the tobacco industries. I believe I can persuade these gentlemen to form a syndicate with me and buy you out, surely to remove the nuisance. Quite so, quite so. That doesn't excite me much, Pendleton, I'll tell you what I'll do for you and the others, I'll buy all three of you. I have no further wish to see you, Royle. You'll see me the next time I come here. Major, why not listen to reason? - 'We'll have to deal with it.' - 'I will not deal with Royle.' That's final. 'If we're going to have trouble him, let it start now.' Brant. That was a fine idea you had about me callin' on you. Your father kept hounds, they'd be chewing on me right this minute. He's upset about the other day, I told you he'd be. They are sitting on the edge of a mighty sharp plank. I'm the boy to run them to right out of the tobacco business. Tobacco, tobacco, tobacco, that's all I hear. You might as well get it straight. If I don't cut your father back, he'll do it to me. If you do, if you ever hurt him, I'll make you sorry for it. My family's been in tobacco for a hundred years. Nobody's gonna change it. Tobacco, tobacco, tobacco. Huh, you're a Singleton alright. For a second there, you could have been your daddy himself. Huh, I'll go along. I'm much prettier than he is. Most anybody is. You know, after all this time you and I could meet like this and just talk like people should. Most of my life I've been backed in of a corner. When we happened to meet, you got tangled in my fight. You're always fightin' about somethin'. Now you're rich and powerful, you can have anything you want. Anything at all. Oh, wait. I didn't mean to carry on like that. I guess I've been to busy to learn parlor manners. Isn't this amusing? All my life I've been hearing about rakes and I never met one. It appears I'm not going to, not tonight anyway. You treat me like a lady, the same as the others. You'd be surprised at how sick I am of being treated like a lady. I have better things to do with my time, thank you. Not so fast, let's get something settled right now. I didn't come callin' on you just to play games. If I wanted to pass the time away, I wouldn't have to come this far from town. Why did you come so far then? I thought you knew. You've always meant something pretty important to me. That's why all these years, I've.. When the time comes, I'm intending to ask you to.. Well, I, I thought you knew that. Marriage? What makes you think I'd marry you? Is something wrong with me? Well, you're not exactly a gentleman. Of course, I don't mind that. You do dress a little loud. And you talk talk like a field hand. Anything else? Mostly what would prevent it is the kind of friends you have. I don't approve of your friends. You mean Sonia? Tell me something. Do you apologize to her for kissing her like you did to me? You do kiss her, don't you? And she kisses you. And then, you touch her.. Very gently or are you rough with her? Yes, I think you're rough, maybe. I don't like her. I won't pretend I do. When she's gone, I might think about marrying you. - Margaret... - Mind now, I don't promise. Oh, well, we can talk about it again. After you get rid of her. She helped me when I needed help. Oh. Then don't forget to thank her when you say goodbye. * You had a dream * * Well I had one too * * I know mine's best because..* The best of birthday parties I was ever at. Absolutely. What became of all the gentlemen? The men start playing cards. Show a man a deck of cards, it wouldn't matter if he had a figure like Venus. You don't have to worry. I've had a better figure than yours since the gold rush. Evening, Mr. Brant. You missed the party. I wouldn't go near Sonia if I were you. If you were me, I'd kill myself. 'You know, Sonia, I feel lucky tonight.' 'That's good.' 'Well, I finally won a hand.' 'Don't forget the chips and go home' Give me another one, will you? Deal me in blind while I have a place down a little. We lost to him. You got a long nose, Frank, you'll look funny without it. Deal in. You aren't going to be here long enough. I thought I was invited to a birthday party. I cancelled the invitation when you didn't show up. I'm sorry, I was late, I, it couldn't be helped. You're apologizing? - You? - Yeah. Me. I wonder what you've been up to. You didn't come here just to wish me a happy birthday. What's on your mind? Smart, aren't you? I know you like the palm of my hand. It's Margaret, isn't it? Sonia, you got an ace showin' it's been raised. It's alright, Marty, she raises back. You and Margaret are alike. You're both greedy, you want something. For you, it's her, but she wants something else. Power like her father. As far as she's concerned, you're just a way of getting it. Get a new record, I'm tired of hearing it over and over. Alright, forget it. I don't want to forget it, I told you before don't talk about her. I said, "alright", I said, "forget it". Let it go. One of these days you'll get so smart, you'll outsmart yourself. Maybe you have already. You're looking for a quarrel, aren't you? Tryin' to work yourself up to tell me something. I'm going to marry her. Give me a cigarette. I don't like to put things off, I wanna be honest. Sure, let's be honest. I could've told you in a different way but things just didn't work out that way. What're you using for tobacco these days, corn silk? This is off. We've known each other a long time since you were a kid in pigtails. I always liked you. But, there wasn't anymore than that for either of us. You're not in love with me it won't break your heart to see the last of me. Of course, not. Why should I care if you walk out on me? The only reason you've hung around this long is because you're so much fun. It's a laugh a minute, when you're around. Just one big joke. Hey, I never saw you cry before. You didn't think I knew how, did you? Well, you've taught me. - Now, get out of here. - Sonia. No lies, no excuses, just get out of here and get married. And never come near me again. What happened that last deal? You had three aces, but you lost to him straight. Three aces and I lost, I must be lucky in love. Deal. Take care of yourself. Bye, dear. And take care of yourselves. He won't be here, you know that. I know. Goodbye, Chris, take care of things. We never fail. If it gets you down, why don't you try. Dr. Monaco's miracle medicine? That'll cure what ails you. What is Dr. Monaco's miracle medicine? - Dr. Monaco. - I'll remember. Bye, Chris. Goodbye. Hmm. - Anything wrong, Mr. Royle? - No, I'm satisfied. He's satisfied. - Ellery, how much do you make? - How much do I make? Twenty dollars a week, sir. You can afford hard sole shoes, make a little noise goin' and comin' to hear you. I always have that feeling you're about to arrest me. - Stop creepin'. - "Stop creepin'", yes. Not bad. Not bad? - You've got a gift for... - Understatement. Thank you, next time I'm stuck for words, I'll send for you. - Get me the singleton file. - Yes, sir. You and the architect wondered why I insisted on having my office right here. "Bad light", the architect said. I want to be able to sit here and see that house. 'Singleton's place.' 'When I was a kid, kickin' along the dust' 'I used to promise myself I'd have a place like it someday' and everything that goes with it. Brant, I've been into the kiln with all the others. Had a little fellow I played Hatchet man so much I can go into the routine on cue. I know all the sob stories my strength is the strength of ten because my heart's impure. You want me to go with you? Not this time. I've waited a long time for this. I've saved up for it, this one is mine. Oh, uh, Brant, about that packaging machine I've another idea. - Tell him. - Well, it occurs to me that.. Come on in, Edison, you can sell it to me, I'm weak. Mr. Singleton sir, there's a gentleman to see you. Mr. Brant Royle. Excuse me. Will you sit down, Royle? No, thank you, this isn't a social call. I didn't think it was. I usually conduct business at my office, however. So do I. I didn't want to embarrass you by sending for you like some dub ahoy shopkeeper. I see that your changing fortune hasn't extended to your manners. I'd appreciate you stating your business as briefly as possible. I brought you something, major. Singleton Company locked, stocking barely with it you've been borrowing money on. I bought all your paper cheap. 'You all did everything you could to knock me down' 'I've eaten you all alive, one by one.' Now, I'm pretty high on the hog, major, I've gotten to you. If I were to call your credit tomorrow, you'd be ruined man. If it weren't for Margaret.. As it is I'll let you out. Call it a wedding present. Wedding present? What are you trying to tell me, sir? We're gonna be married, with or without your approval. That's not true. Ask her. Tell him, Margaret, tell him he's a liar. Don't go gettin' yourself upset, father. Get out of my house, I'm not for sale. - You can't buy any part of me. - I'm not tryin'. I told you before, if it weren't for Margaret... My daughter, don't have to stop you. If she marries you, I've no wish to see her. Father. Now, will you leave, Royle? I may not be a gentleman, but I've tried to go easy with you. I've done my best, Margaret. - I'll see you to the door. - No, thank you. - Father, try to understand. - It's true, isn't it? You've been seeing him all this time. You've made some sort of an arrangement about marriage. We have to face facts, father.. We can't afford pride anymore. The world's gone mad. Everything I ever thought of as beautiful has been swallowed up by that man. Even you. Don't say anything you'll be sorry for. You're tired, upset. Naturally anybody would be. Give yourself time to think about it. He'll wait, he's just fool enough. What you suggesting? Ask him for few days. That'll give us time to make plans. We can see people. Maybe we can save something. If we can't, then it's time enough to consider what he'll have to do if he wants me to marry him. I'll go to him myself, if you want me to. He'll do it for me. He's done this to you. He has infected you with his own rot. What do you expect me to do? Stand here and watch you lose everything because you're too proud to admit you're beaten? What about me? What am I suppose to do when all this is gone? You made me a Singleton. That's all I'm good for. That's all I know. How to behave like a Singleton. No Singleton ever worked the like of you. Now, look. - Mr. Royle. - Major. I've come to do something I should've done years ago. What's that, major? They were my fathers, I think you'll find them satisfactory. - I'll be late for dinner. - Do you mind dropping me off? - Have a good evening, Royle. - Evening. There are laws against dueling now, major. I'm prepared to take the risk. What makes you think I am? I'll ask you as a gentleman, will you give me satisfaction? I wouldn't enjoy killing you, major and if you'd have killed me, why, I wouldn't enjoy that either. To intent forcing me to question your courage? Go ahead, question all you like, it won't change things. You're a coward. Dirty yellow-bellied coward. Go home, major. I don't want to hang for killing you. I intend to see you dead. I know how much that'd mean to you. But I don't find the prospect particularly attractive. No, major. Taking it all, I don't see what I'd gain by it. I could lose a great deal. I won't duel with you. Turn around, Royle. You've come down a long way, haven't you? Defend yourself or I'll kill you where you stand. No, you won't. I might, if I were in your shoes. But you haven't got the kind of courage it takes to shoot an unarmed man. 'You're a gentleman.' 'You live by the code that doesn't permit such things.' That's all you've got left, your gentleman's code. - Royle. - Royle. Leave me alone, I'm alright. Get away. Now there's nothing left. Let him go. 'Ms. Margaret.' 'Ms. Margaret!' I know it's a hard thing to consider but we must be realistic. The Singleton stock, that you've inherited is largely worthless. The factory was mortgaged and so is the house. This house? Singleton house? Mortgaged? Of course, it could be sold. You'd be bound to clear little from it. I'll not do that, Mr. Calhoun. I'm in complete sympathy with your natural reluctant to face such a prospect. But we must look at the facts. Yes indeed. - The fact... - Mr. Calhoun. I'm not selling my father's house. But there's no way! I'll find a way. Brant Royle. - Where? - In the library. - It's the most... - Go along, I'll be right there. I was born in this house. My father and his father were born here. I'll sell anything. But not Singleton house. Will you excuse me? Just like your daddy would have. Tell him what we think of him here. In my day, a dozen men would've considered that an honor and pleasure to horse with him through the gates. Tell him, Margaret. I heard her. I don't blame her, the way she feels. Maybe I shouldn't have come so soon. I waited for you. I wanted you to know what really happened. I know how people are, these things get exaggerated. My father is dead. He was no exaggeration. I did everything I could to prevent any trouble. We don't have to talk about it. My father was a very proud man. What he did. What happened was inevitable. Blame myself for not seeing it from the star. There's anything we could've done differently. Whatever hatred there was, was in him. It's over. We can be honest with each other at last. Leave me alone. I'm being honest with you, if that's what you want. Stay away from me now. Margaret, what makes me sure only my worst side to you? What makes me hurt you when I don't wanna hurt you? All I want, all I ever wanted is you. All the time, I was making a place in the world to show you. Now you can have it. It's yours, all of it. - Brant, I have to see you. - Not now. But it-it's urgent this time. I-I've been trying to.. We can begin now, this shouldn't take long. Gentlemen, it used to be 100 companies in this valley. Today, there is only one Royle Incorporate. Mr. Royle is tobacco in this neck of the woods. Mr. Royle considers you gentlemen as the best. They want you to have the subsidiary companies of the corporations act as member of board of directors. You'll have a free hand in the company assigned after a point. We have no intension interfering with your conduct of business. We expect nothing from you except a substantial profit. Are there any questions? Help a Royle cigarette. Don't like 'em. Have these scores that we've given you contain the financial details of the particular company each of you'll operate. Now, nominations are in order for the chairman of the board. I have the pleasure of nominating Mr. Brant Royle. - Second. - Nominations are closed. Those who're in favor of Mr. Royle will kindly say "aye". Aye. Mr. Royle's elected. I move we adjourn. Second? All in favor, gentlemen, we are adjourned. Went pretty well. Why not? What choice do they have? Tell Mr. Barton, he can come in now and ask Hillary come in too. Today's clippings Mr. Royle on the Savannah Market. What's Barton so upset about? He wasn't invited to be on the board of directors. He, uh has ideas how to run the company. That's why he wasn't invited. I'm getting tired of Mr. Barton. Go easy, Brant. You wanted to see me? Yes, Brant. I don't like the... Sit down. The European Tobacco Syndicates still hasn't shown any signs of letting us in, have they? What you doing about it? Next week there'll be a man at every tobacco shop in Europe giving away Royle cigarettes. Of course it'll take quite a bit money for about three months. - After that the market's ours. - Good. What don't you like? I don't like the way I'm treated. I-I don't have anything to say around here. I don't have anything to do with the adminis... Cable my broker in London. Beginning next Monday and start selling European Tobacco. Syndicate short at a 1000 shares a day until I say stop. - Stop. - Take care of this. - Right away. - Right away. In less than five years, I've made you wealthy and now complain. I'm not complaining. It's only... I happened to know some of the thing you've done. - I can't say that I have proof. - Who asked you to? I'm merely suggesting. Downstairs in the factory there's box labeled suggestions, anything you have to say put it in there. - Brant. - What? Never mind. 'I don't wanna do this.' 'I've put it all from time to time but I have had enough.' I'm leaving, Brant. Where to? We're going to Detroit, maybe you've read about it. They started to manufacture horseless carriages. I think there's money in it. That's your idea of business, is it? Automobiles, gadgets for millionaires. You aren't leaving. Read your contract. I may tell you to get out but you can't quit. Unless. Just how much does going to Detroit mean to you? What are your terms Mr. Royle? What do you want to let me go? All your stock and remaining rights in the cigarette machine I'll buy it out that for you. I see. - You're way ahead of me. - Always have been. You know I can't beat you in the first place because I thought you had more imagination and courage and the others. I guess I deserve everything you've done to me. I've learnt a great deal from you, Brant. If I weren't an honest man, I might be able to use it. Find out everything there is to know about automobile. Get one, I want to see what they look like. Well, it's piling up. Everything you've done to get where you are. A little fund of hatred you've created. What's the matter with you? This past few months I've seen something in your face and eyes I've never saw before. Greed I thought, arrogance. Now I know what it is. Brant.. You're a man with a sickness. Kingsmont. In the car. - Sonia. - Chris. Ah, it's so good to see you. Is that Paris dress you got on? - You getting fat. - What do you mean, fat? Not really, just nice. Isn't Brant with you? He doesn't know you're back, I-I wanted to see you first. Tell me. How was Europe? - Big. - London, Paris, Vienna. I'll take Kingsmont for excitement. Oh, you've heard about Singleton. Brant badly hurt? He takes a lot of killing. Some luggage for a bachelor girl. It's wonderful being where a town goes crazy about it. The nicest part of being rich is having so much money. Really fancy. Oh, it's nothing. Aw, how wonderful. We hoped you like it, we worked hard on it. Good, it's beautiful. Brant did it? No, I did. I should have known. Well, you haven't even, eh.. Ah! I can't believe it. Oh, Chris, it's really beautiful. Think nothing of it, only cost a fortune. Everything else may have changed but not you. You're still the same. Sorry to hear that. Oh, Chris, you thought of everything, even initials. The years too. I remembered you often, Chris. How kind you always were. Meant a lot to me remembering that. That makes it easier to say something that's on my mind. I saw everything in my time, I've lied, cheated and talked my way in and out of every jail in this country. No matter what happen, I always thought I.. I remember once I sold a bottle of hair-restorer to a sheriff's wife who had lost her hair using the first bottle I sold her. But, uh.. I can't seem to sell myself. Sonia. You may not believe this but.. I've been trying to ask you to marry me. Oh, Chris. We get along together, we like the same things, why not? I'd be much nicer to you than Brant ever was. I see. You're rescuing me from the dragon. I've always liked you, Chris. Right now more than ever. But don't worry about me. I don't believe in dragons anymore. Alright. But it wasn't just a rescue act. I was thinking of myself too, remember that, will you? It's going to be different now. Brant and me. I was in Paris when I read about Singleton. And you thought that Brant and Margaret would be through. Mm-hmm. Well, I think.. Chris, you're not leaving? What about your tea? I hate that darn stuff. Anyway I.. I couldn't stand to seeing you cry. Chris, what is it? Sonia, Brant isn't really bad. The thing you've to remember about him is that.. He started tough because he had to be, to get anywhere. Now it's become a habit with him. He's like a horse with blinders on. He sees what's right in front of him. He puts one foot in front of the other until he gets what thinks is going. The trouble is he.. He doesn't know where he's going. You haven't seen the morning paper. Here. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon, Simon. Well, the gentlemen are waiting in the library, Mr. Malley. Mr. Royle with them? He hasn't come down yet. - Shall I announce your... - Not yet. I'd like to talk to Mr. Royle first. - Have you seen him? - No. - Does he know about the AG? - I don't think so. Royle stocks dropped seven points... I expected it to go even lower. Gentlemen, let's make an effort to be calm shall we? Sit down. Now, Mr. Malley, I... I cabled Mr. Royle some months ago when I first heard about the monopoly suit. - We were never informed of it. - I assumed he could handle it. I might add that the monopoly suit comes as no surprise to us. It's a surprise to all of us. We're done battling the past biding by our decisions lets assume the future would be every bit as bright. Mr. Royle knows we're here, why.. - Hello, Brant. - Hello. Everybody's in the library. - What? - They're all in the library. - Who is? - Our board of directors. Gentlemen, I-I... Brant, we have got to do something. If we don't answer this suit they'll chop us up into four or five companies. Nass did a cartoon of you as octopus. When the word got out, the market went down seven points. - When I started working for... - Who are you? Johnson, Vice President in-charge of lumberjack tobacco. I appointed him to the board when you were away. What do you all want? It's about the monopoly suit I sent you all the details, didn't I? - I did, I haven't read it yet. - What? I-I can't make any decisions now, I'm not interested at... But we have to make some decision now. - I said I'm not interested. - Brant? Get them outta here, get rid of them. Gentlemen, I'm sure you understand. Mr. Royle's had a very difficult journey, in a.. Few days, when he's rested.. We'll have another meeting. Without me, Royle is big but he isn't that big. I'll tell him you said so. They all resigned. Get a new set, the woods are full of vice presidents. I'll try to find some with thicker skins. - Did you have a nice trip? - No. Glad to hear. Brant, this thing in Washington is serious. Monopoly is getting to be an ugly word. We haven't broken any laws. Some of 'em are trifle bent. But that is not what worries me. Where is the Attorney General getting his information? Have you heard from John Barton lately? I think it's Barton myself, but we have to be sure. Let me call in the Piggegons. No detectives, when you hire detectives you have to tell them what they're looking for and why. They won't find anything we don't know already. But they'll know why it's important. I'll see you at the office. Brant.. What's the matter? What makes you think it's any of your business? If we weren't friends I'd keep my mouth shut. There's something that's eating you. Gone for a year, I'm trying to bring you up to date you haven't heard half of what I've said. You seem to have something on your mind and.. I've got a pretty, good idea what it is. I've seen marriages before where the wife didn't like the idea... I don't need you pokin' into my private affairs. Alright, forget it. You looked like a man who could use a little friendship. I should've known better. By the way, I almost forgot.. Welcome home, Brant. - Finished? - Finished. - That much? - That much, not any less. If Mr. Royle finds out I did this... - He won't, I'll take the blame. - You'll take the blame for it? Must be the paneling, there seems to be an echo in here. If that's more about the monopoly suit... No, no this is something else. You're not gonna like this, it's personal. There are your private accounts. These are the stock market records. It's all down there. Right now there's only a fraction of our net worth but stock holders can ask some very embarrassing questions it. Don't bother me with this. And I've been thinkin' you knew about it. Here. You cabled me from London. Your wife's Singleton company stock in equal paces with Royle share for share. I objected your remember? You cabled that it was all in the family. There that's the drawing account that you placed in Mrs. Royle's disposal. Take a good look at it. You'll find some of the items are rather heavy. According to these reports from NYSE. Mrs. Royle no longer owns any of our shares. She's been selling steadily for the past seven months. It isn't in the family anymore. What're you drivin' at? I've added it up for ya. There it is. Your wife has dug into this company for two million dollars. Not exactly a love match. You can't buy me out at the market price. I'm getting out, Brant, I've had enough of. First, it was Sonia, then Barton and the others.. It had to be my turn sooner or later. I'll head our office at New York if you want but.. I'm leaving here. You're not gettin' out, you're not goin' anywhere. You'll stay here, just like you always have only from now on you'll take orders same as the others. No way you can hold me. You make one move to sell out and I'll dump so many Royle shares on the market they'll be buyin' 'em with cigar coupons. After all the others break in, you'll be easy. Alright. I'll hang around a while just out of curiosity. Wanna find out what happens to ya. I think that might be interesting. Good evening, Mr. Royle. Ask Mrs. Royle if she could see me in the library. She went out this afternoon. She left this for you, sir. Shall we keep dinner waiting? No, Mrs. Royle's going to Ms. Tabitha's for Christmas. - I'll eat alone. - Yes, sir. - Ms. Sonia's asleep. - Open this door, let me in. Go away, Ms. Sonia's asleep. Ms. Sonia! Shall I call the police, Ms. Sonia? No. Mr. Royle is just here to wish me a merry Christmas in his own charming way. Is it alright? Hadn't I better call the police? No, Queenie, I can handle him. 'I've had enough practice.' Come here. I said, come here. I feel sorry for you. You're my girl, you always were and always will be. You haven't forgotten me, don't pretend you have. Isn't this a little silly? Sonia, it's-it's Christmas. You're not getting any presents from me. I haven't seen you in a while I thought... I know what you thought. Now get out. I always thought that if there was one person I could depend on it was you. That was a long time ago. You've never been beaten before have you? Now you're beginning to find out how it feels. I know what you're talking about. I'm talking about you. Your marriage and that life you live in the house you couldn't wait to own. You made your bed but it isn't soft and comfortable. It's a cold bed isn't it? I got what I wanted, I don't need you, I don't need anybody. That's why you come visiting me in the middle of the night. Now get out and don't come back. Next time there'll be a bigger chain on the door. I didn't expect this, not from you not after all I've done for ya. What have you ever done for me? I made you rich. Who are you, Brant? How can you live with a world with people and a heart all choked up with money? It's in you like a stone. Go back to your mansion, where you can buy anything. Except the way I loved you once. Go back to Margaret. You deserve each other. Merry Christmas, Sonia. - Happy New Year. - Thank you. I didn't know you were still here, Mr. Royle. - I've been goin' over these. - Over these? Oh yes, those... those. You knew about. Mrs. Royle too, why didn't you tell me? Tell you, I-I'm afraid, I was afraid. Mr. Malley's still here too, he's with a detective. - Detective? - Detective. I would've dropped this advocate at that point but your orders were very explicit. That'll be all, thanks for coming in. Who is this? Mr. Norman. He's applying for a position in the company. - Application blank? - Mr. Royle I'd like to... You're a detective, you were hired to find out the intel sources of the AG about the Royles company that's your report, read it! Let it go, Brant. There's nothing in it that matters. Then why not let him read it? It's Barton, just as you thought. Facts and figures, it all came from Barton. Where did Barton get it? I bought him out over a year ago. There's one name that could possibly be on that report that might explain a great deal. Assuming there is one such name, do you know how important it is? What name is that? - What name? - Mrs. Margaret Royle. Going somewhere? Savannah. I've been invited to the Governor's ball. I'll only be gone a week. Only a week this time? Before that only two weeks at Ms. Tabby's. It's nice of you to come home at all. No quarrels please. I have a headache. I've had a headache ever since we were married. She bought this in Paris, on our honeymoon. 'Very daring, you could see through it.' Brant! Tabby doesn't mind. She knows everything there is to know about us. Maybe even more than I do, huh Tabby? How much do you know? How much, Tabby! I mind my own business. I wonder. Gee, look at this. Beautiful, you wouldn't think anything so beautiful would be a lie. How's my old friend, Barton these days? Did you see him in Washington? I thought you were in on it. Whose idea was it? Yours or Barton's? Mine. I wondered how long it would be before you found out what I was doing. First I was nervous. I thought surely you'd suspect right away. But you were so sure of yourself, that made it easy. Never in your mind that something was wrong. Until now. I have lied to myself from the beginning. After a while that's all there was you lyin' to me and me lying to myself. When did it start? When my father died. The day he was buried I thought of nothin' else. How to destroy you.. Had to make you suffer as he did. And I have, haven't I? Now I want a divorce. That's one humiliation I won't stand for. You're not gonna drag me through a divorce court. What else is there? You gonna forgive me? You'll willing to forget all I've done? Darling, you are ridiculous. Where are all those people who were so afraid of you? In your factories in Kingsmont.. What would they say if they could see you like this? Like an ol' hand dog that comes crawlin' back after you've kicked it.. Scrammin' in the dirt right up to your feet so you can kick him again. I've never seen you before the way you really are. This is what I've been driving myself to get, is it? I feel like I've been wallowing in filth. If that's what you wanted I hope it's made you happy. Now, get out of here. I will. But you'll never forget me. With all of your wealth and power there won't be a day or an hour that you'll get me out of your mind. Till the day you die, you'll remember the Singletons. What they've done to you. You're insane like your father. You're out of your mind with pride and arrogance. You'd like to believe that wouldn't you? You like to comfort yourself thinkin' that anybody dare stand up to the high and mighty Brant Royle is crazy-mad. I knew exactly what I was doing all this time. Remember that, Brant. You know what kept me going? What made it possible for me to bear you? I was thinking of this.. This moment. The look on your face. 'The way you'd feel when you found out.' 'I lived for it.' Now it's over. And I'll forget it. See if you can. Dirty, rotten! Don't come back to this valley, never come back! Take what you've got and get out with it. 'Goodbye to you Singletons and good riddance!' You wanted Singleton house, you've always wanted it. It's your now. You've paid enough for it. Stop! Let it burn! Stop it! I said let it burn! I want to see it burnt. Don't you understand? I told you not to come here again. It's the 20th century, Brant, let's start it right. With you leaving me... alone. I came to say goodbye. You're hurt. Seems like I always come to you when I'm hurt. Margaret's left me. Singleton house, burnt out last night. There's nothing left of it. It meant a lot to me once, it meant everything. I stood there and watched it burn and.. It meant nothing at all. Wasn't anything saved? - Couldn't they... - I let it burn. They could've stopped it maybe. I wouldn't let 'em try, I wanted it to burn. Whatever it was, it's been eatin' in me all these years seemed to burn out with it. I'm glad to be rid off it, I came here to tell you that. Somehow after all this time I've found... peace, I guess. I don't have to bull my way through anymore. I'm leaving Kingsmont, Sonia. But you're business, this monopoly suit? Malley will take care of it. Royle Incorporated is so big now it doesn't even need me. Anyhow, it's just a way of getting what I thought I wanted. You've got everything you wanted everything there was. And I lost everything worth having. Including you. If you're asking me something, Brant, you're late with it. Years late. I figured it that way. Sonia.. I'm sorry. I don't remember sayin' that to anybody ever in my life. It isn't easy for me to say it, but I owe you that. I'm sorry. You fool, you stubborn fool. Why did it have to take all these years to teach you? Go ahead, I've got it comin'. You had something in you once I loved. It's gone now. I've watched you kill it. That hungry wildness, it's dead. Beaten out of you because you wouldn't listen. You had to do everything the hard way. Till there's nothing left of the Brant Royle, I loved once. I helped you get started.. But if I had to do it all over again.. And you came and asked me for money.. I wouldn't give you one red cent. If we had to do it all over again, I wouldn't ask. Goodbye, carpetbagger. If it means anything to you now.. The worst mistake I made.. Was you.
