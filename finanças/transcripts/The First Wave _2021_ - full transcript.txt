Just one moment of silence, one minute. We are battling a deadly virus. Is there an intrusion on daily life? Yes. This is going to be a long day, and it's going to be a hard day, and it's going to be an ugly day, and it's going to be a sad day. This is a character test for us individually; it's a character test for us collectively as a society. What did you do at that moment when all around you lost their head? Okay. I'll see you later, okay? You good? Okay. Medical rapid response to room T812 Bed A. All righty, I'm back. I'm Dr. Douge, okay, so I'm going to be in charge of your care while you're here. Last week, there were like maybe one, two, three patients that we kind of heard about, like whispered about. So you're telling me you're not needing as much oxygen as you did before. Is this a COVID patient? Is this not a COVID patient? The infection kind of went into his bone, okay? And now I have a list where pretty much all of the patients have COVID‐19. It's such a crazy, scary feeling. Medical rapid response, LIJ tower. All right, I gotta see what happened, hold on. Guys, We're gonna pulse for a pulse check. - Yeah, epi is in. - Let me know. Pulse compressions, pulse check. Wait. Stop, I have a pulse, I have a pulse right here, pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse. This is the problem, it's new. That is the worst thing in medicine. We are taught pattern recognition, and as of right now there is no clear pattern. His blood pressure's fine, but his white count was going up right? Yeah. - No fever? - No fever. Look he got the medication and this is still going up. But this guy is telling me he feels better. Is this telling us. Not a good sign. It's hard not to hold on to the emotions of your patients, their families. He's coughing up blood when he coughs, okay. The thing is, he is. But I have to separate myself. All right, bye. In order to get through my day. Medical rapid response to LIJ T8‐12 bed A. All right. There's a pulse. Do we have the pads on him? So where is he? Do we have a pulse? Yeah, we have a pulse. It's okay. It's okay. So I'm part of the primary team, I'm gonna call the family. Hi, this is Doctor Douge. I'm one of the medical doctors that's taking care of your dad. I wanted to let you know that the team went to go see him and then he was found down. Right now we're literally doing CPR to see if we can restart his heart, okay. Did we get a pulse? Did we get a pulse or no? Nothing? Pulse check. Nothing this family. So you guys are calling it? - What time is it? - 7:03. This one? Okay. What happened? Wait. Oh my god. Can we just have a quick moment silence before everyone leave? Oh, this is so, I saw him this morning. That's what everyone says, they were fine this morning. Like I was just, we just we said what are you doing? He was, oh. It's crazy. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've tried multiple rounds of CPR and we were unable to bring him back. Do you hear me? Mr. Ellis? Mr. Ellis, open your eyes. Do you hear me? Oh, my gosh. So good to see you without a tube. Oh my god, look at that beautiful baby. Look at the baby who woke up. Your daughter woke up. How old is Ava? She's seven months. Oh my goodness. Seven months. Hi, Daddy. You see? Hi, Daddy. Say hi Daddy. Look, look you can see. Look. See. Oh, look a the face. I miss the face. Yeah, can you say something? Yes? He has a lot of secretion so it's hard for him to talk. Hi. Could you say hi? Hi, you're trying. - Is he okay? - Yeah. I'm gonna put it back on, okay, cause his stats are a little low. So this mask that we have on him is a bipap mask, it just helps it pushes some of the air in. Yeah. Yeah Maybe in a couple of days he could come off that, okay? Okay. Everyday you're gonna get better and better. Yeah. And then you'll be home with us soon. All right. I think that's everything. Thank you so much. Have a good day. Have a good day. Bye. Thanks, Bye‐bye. One of the things that made me fall in love with Ahmed from the beginning was how much he valued family and friends. Ahmed works for the NYPD and I work at a hospital so we're both essential workers. It's going to be one of those days where you just spit everything out huh? Was that you saying yes? He's only 35 and the doctors say he is high risk because he is overweight and diabetic. I'm just hoping for the best right now. Dad. Oh no. - What happened to him? - He got hurt. Oh okay. Okay, what do you want me to write? D‐A‐D‐D‐Y. Mom. I wish we could, we can't go to the hospital though. What? But when we FaceTime him we could read the story to Daddy. Not cool, man. Scary but not cool. Of course. So we're going to take your temperature, okay. Attention, please. Medical rapid response LIJ tower, 4th Floor, Room T‐402 Do you feel like you're having trouble breathing? Are you having trouble breathing? - Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, each one is getting harder and harder. Yeah, check the pulse. Oh, I need that. Hang on. Start compressions, start compressions. - Oh, guys. - Yeah. I don't think that you are going to find any nurse that's gonna say that they feel like a hero, you know, I mean everybody's. Imagine the new nurses. I'd be terrified if I was a new nurse. That seems, that must be scary for them. I would probably quit. I cried every night as a new nurse, and it was just because I was a new nurse. I couldn't imagine. Yeah. That's the thing. Right, so. Well, we got lucky last night. We were here and we were looking at the thing like. We had one intubation, and one rapid response, and we were sitting here like, I had to check the phone, like, is this right? Batteries dead. Yeah, and today we had 23 rapids. 23 rapids. - How many intubated? - Eight. - Eight intubated? - Eight. Eight intubations today. Yeah, we made up for it. And like three code blues. Uh‐hmm. ‐ Uh‐hmm. ‐ Um. - Is that mine? - That's yours. Medical Rapid Response to LIJ 8th Tower room T820. Come here, da da da. Come here. What have we got? Every single day, I feel terrified. Being in rooms with all those droplets in the air. You are the ones that are exposed first thing. Thank you. It's going to be the third epi. How many. There's another rapid. Tower 402. Hang in there buddy. Guys, everybody off. Okay. All clear. All clear. Everyone's off, yes? - Everyone's off. - Clear. Shock. Resume compression. Upgrade, Code Blue to LIJ. Okay. We'll go there. Pulse? It's an awful feeling to wonder every single time I walk into a room with a patient, Is this it? Is this the time when I'm going to get sick, and I'm going to be the one in the bed, especially when the patient is a nurse. You feel like you have stuff in your mouth? Good girl. Okay In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen. I believe in God the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth, and of Jesus Christ his only son, our Lord was conceived with the holy spirit. We are a family of nurses. Born the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate. All of us living here together. They ascended to heaven and are seated at the right hand of the father. We were so excited about the pregnancy. 3, 2, 1! But then my wife tested positive for COVID. The communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins. Then it spread through the house, and we all got it. 168/102. Did Mom talk to Doctor Hawthorne, Pa? We rushed her to the hospital. And she had an emergency C‐section. But then things got worse. It's just so difficult. You can't be with your wife. You can't be your boy. Remember where do you hug? Where do you just hug? Yeah, just this. You feel good today? Yeah? Uh‐hmm. Getting chubby. Okay, let's do. And my daughter Andi, she doesn't have COVID but she has asthma, so we're scared about infecting her. - Yeah. - Okay. And you just put it like that. - Let's use the dark one. - Okay. Remember you just press on it. It's the worst experience of my life. Yeah, but I know, yeah, I just, sometimes I just let my fear be my strength because I know one day this will end and I'm gonna be with my wife and my baby and everyone and everybody. We have been behind this virus from day one. It is an invisible beast, it is an insidious beast. And these are stressful, emotional times so I'll just present the facts. Where we are today is a pivotal point in this entire situation with the coronavirus. This is a mass grave, being dug for Coronavirus victims. New York City is ground zero again, and by far the biggest pandemic hot spot in the United States. Tonight a state of emergency is in effect for New York State because of the Coronavirus outbreak. Critics say Governor Cuomo's response is coming up short. Hospitals are becoming overwhelmed. There is still a need for ventilators for millions of masks, the problem is hospitals are running out of space, out of equipment, and even out of personnel. I am asking health care professionals across the country, please come help us in New York now. All hospitals have to increase their capacity by 50% and try to increase their capacity 100%. I don't want to leave anything lying around here since I don't know what's happening with. This way. Who is this? What's the last name? You're going to. - 27. - 27. So why don't you put Bartuse into 35? Here, this is my last monitored spot. And then, I'm gonna bring them, the rest of them off to the side. N45 is coming. Attention please, medical rapid response to LIJ Tower 4th floor, Room T412. Medical rapid response to LIJ Tower 4th floor, room T412 Well, this is crazy. This is crazy. One other thing, just to help me out. Uh‐hmm. If you could just open up the meds because I, because a lot of these people have, like, infections and stuff like that. I need to know everything that's not supposed to be there but is there. Okay. So, he unfortunately has severe single organ failure. Yeah. Oh, my goodness. We've seen this happen a lot. We can make his kidneys better, we can make his brain better, but if he can't ventilate, he will never get a transplant. When you are struggling to take a breath, every second feels like an eternity, every minute seems like forever. That is the look that I see multiple times a day. But people don't see that. He was admitted. He was positive. He's been negative three times since. Yeah. It's still precautions. Oh, my goodness. The majority of my patients are Black, Hispanic, or immigrant. And being born in the Bronx from Haitian parents, I'm not that far removed from a lot of my patients. And every time you see the patient you can't help but say, "Damn, this can easily be my mom." It's tough to see your people constantly have to suffer. Do you feel like you are out of breath? - A bit. - A little bit? All right, take a deep breath. It means keeping physical distance where you can. It means using masks. LIJ. Medical rapid response to LIJ A tower room T820. Medical rapid response to LIJ A tower room T820. Guys, we need some help in here now. Don't fight, baby. Mr. Ellis? You hang in there. Feel free to cough, you're too awake. That's what it is. Come on, buddy. We are going to put you back to sleep. All right? It's okay, bud. Mr. Ellis has had a persistent fever and was breathing really, really fast. It's all right. It's all right, honey. I don't want you to be too awake while you're having this tube in your mouth. So we had to put him back on the ventilator. He was the only one like, I kept looking at him and I just... I know. Every time I look at him, I see those little kids and I just, like, I needed him to do well. Yeah. He said, "I'm so young and I have a young family. Please don't let me die." He has two little kids like I do, and so I just wanted to see him do well, I don't know. I just, every day we go home and I think about how I might be bringing this home to my own husband and how that could have been him, and so I just wanted to see him do well. Austin, say hi to Daddy. Austin, do you want to get your story that you made for Daddy so Daddy can hear it? Go get it. Go get it. That's amazing. Okay, Ahmed. Have a good night. We'll talk to you again tomorrow, hopefully. So he did run a bit of a fever today. Uh‐hmm. So they're still continuing his antibiotics, and um they did start some antifungals as well. Okay. Okay. Some thing came back in his, in his cultur showing that there were, maybe, you know, some fungal stuff growing. Sometimes, my mind does go down a dark path. What am I going to do with two kids by myself? I have to keep it together. I have kids who can't see me fall apart. I just gotta keep going, thinking positively.

Okay. You want to lean on that? Very good. Okay. "I want to get better and I will get better just pray life is worth it." You are getting better, okay? And we are all praying for you, I promise. We will never forget this, because what we've been doing here over the last number of weeks is extraordinary and special. And you are fearful, you are stressed, but you raise the bar each and every day that you get up and come to work. This is doing what we were called to do when we enter the profession of healthcare. Everyday, we look death right in its eye. And the scary part is it looks right back at you. It's a storm that nobody's ever been in before. There's no playbook for this, there are no directions. I'm curious how you guys are feeling. Well, we're all pretty new to LIJ, and they sent us to the floors to help out at first, and then we started doing the iPads. I don't want to get emotional because it's actually been hard. 'Cause, to see the families upset. When you're the only one there while their family is on video chat and they're crying because they can't hold their hands. You're trying your best to, like, accommodate for them not being able to be there and, like, you become their family member, and I feel like it's, like, I'm losing my family members through the phone. So like that builds up with you. Unfortunately, he's in the process of dying. So the question becomes is giving him the oxygen something that's prolonging the inevitable which is him passing away, and unfortunately, I think that's the case. None of us think that the oxygen is doing anything other than prolonging the suffering, so the next step is to stop the oxygen, keep him comfortable with the morphine and see how he does with that. I'll call the family. This is going to be 12, right? All right. So E12? The bad news isn't just bad, the bad news is actually terrible. Highest single day death toll yet, 779 people. 9/11 was supposed to be the darkest day in New York for a generation. We lose 2,753 lives on 9/11. We've lost over 7,000 lives to this crisis. That is so shocking and painful and breathtaking. I can't, I don't even have the words for it. The emotional sendoff for a New Jersey doctor who survived the virus. Good evening. I'm Chuck Scarborough. And I'm Natalie Pasquarella. New York and New Jersey have hit a new record single day death toll for a second day now. Now, new numbers from the city show that minority communities are being hit especially the hardest, specifically Hispanics and African‐Americans. Now New York State now has more cases than any country in the world. Yes, country with nearly 150,000 cases. Ugh. ‐ You fixed him? ‐ Uh‐hmm. - Oh, look at that. - Yeah. ‐ Did he eat today? ‐ Uh‐hmm. I like to see that. What are we thinking for when he goes home? So that's the thing, so we have been actually sending people home on oxygen. Right? Okay. But ideally if he is able to stay at like two, three liters. But the thing is when he drops, he is still symptomatic. Yeah. He needs to be our success story. Hi, this Doctor Douge, I wanted to give you updates on how your dad's doing. So from an oxygenation standpoint, his oxygen level has been 100% on the mask. Yeah, so he's doing so well. He's been through a lot but he's coming on the other side. Code blue to LIJ Tower, sixth floor. Oh, shit. Room 611A. Code blue. You're lying. Tower, sixth floor. Room 611A. Got it. I have it in my hands. Epi? Second Epi, 6:59. Wait a minute. Is this the B bed? Yes. Do you have bicarb yet? - No. - Do we have a board? We need a flat board. We need a board. Four, five, six, seven, eight. Can you push that epi? Epi being pushed at 6:57. Here. Just one moment of silence, one minute. It's just been a long ass day. Just so fucking long. It's just you hear it in their voices, but you have no sense of reassurance for these people. I can't give that to them. Like it's just, I'm so used to saying, oh this is what, this is what tends to happen. But every moment it's like you don't know, you thought they were fine. You called their daughter like, oh he's relatively stable, and then you get a call like, oh shit like he's dead. It's like, you're always on edge you can never have a sigh of relief and if I feel like this, you just think of the family. You can't see them. You can't hear them. Like half of these people, we don't even have fucking phone chargers. There's not even, all these people they have their phones the shit's dead. No one has a phone charger for them, if you try it people don't want to get cross‐contaminated you're so fucking isolated. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know I'm not supposed to curse. I'm sorry. But it's just like, what am I supposed to do? So it's just like you just feel so helpless, and like it's so nice, yes, people say thank you, you're saving lives. Before I felt like I was saving lives. Before you felt like okay this person had a heart attack, you give them the medicine, there's a good shot for them, but here? It's like you got nothing. You just hope and pray that shit doesn't happen to you. It's just every day it's like it's so ridiculous. It's just every day. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Every day. I have the nurse here at the ICU. - Okay. - Yeah. Where's my wife? How is she? Can I talk to her? Yes you can. I didn't say. I have my daughter right here with me. Hi mommy. Are you feeling good?

All these patients have been here for so long, we just, we need him to do well. - You okay? - I'm okay. - Deep breath. - Very nervous. You nervous? Yeah, I haven't seen him in a whole month. Oh, my God. Let's see if I can fit this in my pocket. - Hello. - Ahmed. - Look who we have. - Hi baby. Ah, Ahmed. Look at what your wife made you. Look at this. You see? Ahmed. And Austin drew you a picture. It says love Austin. Ava is so big now, she has two teeth. And she tries to steal all of Austin's toys. Ahmed. You hear me? Can you squeeze my hand? Yeah. Oh gosh.

Floyd gasping for air and telling officers I can't breathe. - Say his name! - George Floyd. Say his name! I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. For 90 days we were just dealing with the COVID crisis, and now we have the COVID crisis and we have the civil unrest from the murder of Mr. Floyd. Those are not disconnected situations. You can see the disparate effect of this disease and how it reinforced the disparity and inequity in society. All of this is happening at a truly stressed time in this country, the politics is on high speed and is divisive. So it's one of the most difficult situations we've had in modern history. Stop everybody. What are you doing here? Move! Move! Get up there. Get the fuck off of me. Get the fuck off me. Get Back. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up, keep going. Back up.
