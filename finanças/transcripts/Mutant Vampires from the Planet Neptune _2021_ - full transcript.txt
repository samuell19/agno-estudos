We could be in real danger here. - I'll say. We got a real Krakatoa situation going on. - Oh. - Yeah. Could be a magnitude of 8.0 at the least. - Oh, eight, huh? - Uh-huh, a fault line devastator. - Oh, my God. You're an idiot. - Uh-huh. - You know what your brain ceases to operate when you get an erection. - Yeah, yeah. - And you just, you just don't pay attention to anything I say. - Yes. Whoa, whoa. - What? - Did you feel that? - What? - Jesus Christ. - What, what? - Oh, my God. - What, what, what? Goddammit. - Oh, you shoulda seen your face. Ah! - You almost- - Ow. - Gave me a heart attack you- - Ow. - Bastard. - What? - Don't do that. - I'm sorry, I thought I felt another earthquake coming. - Oh, yeah, right. - Oh, I'm sorry that my over caution to protect you is an inconvenience. - Don't make fun of me. - Oh. - No. - Come on. - Uh-uh, I hate you. - Come on. - No. - Just give in. - No, stay away from me you jerk. - Just kidding. - Okay, what was that? - Okay, quit goofing off, it's time to get nasty. - I'm, I'm serious. - What? - What was that? - What was what? - Shh.

Somebody help me! Help! No, no, no, no, please, please, please stay away from me. Help! - What the fuck? - Oh, my God, it's been a whole three fucking days. I missed you. Uh, I am dying for caffeine. Holy shit, I'm so hungover. - What'd you get into last night? - Buzz and I hit the Crystalline for some dancing and drinking. Nothing to cray, but I- - Yeah, right. - Didn't fucking eat anything as per usu. - Oh, no. - I know, I know, I know. Come on, the guys are already loading up the car, and are about to head over to pick us up. And I'm like dying for a caramel macchiato. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - There was additional word from NASA this morning concerning the astroid that collided with Earth just 12 hours ago. Radio telemetry from the seismometers planted at the base of Mt. St. Helens had indeed recorded the shock of the impact as a 2.2 on the Richter scale. Now this object that fell- - Oh, shit, dude, I didn't realize there was a meteor shower last night, damn. - Small as far as these things go. About eight meters across, which is much bigger than your average bus. - What the fuck are my tax dollars paying for anyway? - What the fuck do tax dollars have to do with the meteor shower? - Whatever, time to get high. - Sounds good to me. God, dude, I've been waiting for this weekend for literally weeks at this point. Jesus, this will be nice. - Oh, shit. There you go, dude. - Hand this. - Okay, so checklist. First the essentials. So what do we got? We got the half ounce of the, the Northern Lights. Um, we got the, uh, couple, couple pre rollie ollies of that Space Dust swag. That is good shit by the way. Some of those sour gummy edibles. A 10 pack, which actually is now a nine pack. We got the Grey Paw for the ladies. We got half G of the Skull. Half G of Jager. A pint of the Rebel Yell, and uh, ja, ja, ja, ja, oh, uh, some of that nasty ass Duck wine that Cassie requested. - Right, the, um, Wandering Duck.

We've got first aid kits or a first aid kit. And then let's see I got my walking stick. Don't wanna forget about that. Some sunscreen. Playing cards for entertainment. Maybe some dominoes in there as well. Yep, definitely have the dominoes. Uh, hotdogs and burgers are in the cooler. And then I also got some stuff for, uh, for some smores, 'cause it's just not a camping trip without it, so I think that about does it. - Dope, man. Models of modern efficiency. - Hell yeah.

Yeah, I guess so. - That's dope, man, I dig it. - Yeah. - I guess not all of Starr's friends are catty gossip queens. - No, man, she's, uh, she's really cool.

I deprive Buzz for more than 36 hours and he starts freaking out, I'm gonna break up with him or some shit. Uh. - Uh, no. Yeah, we've been taking it really slow. He's been really sweet about it actually. Really. - So do you think this weekend? - I don't wanna rush it you know? Like I, believe it or not trying not to fuck this one up. - How are you gonna fuck this up? She's clearly into you. She's stuck around this long didn't she? - I guess you have a point. - Bro, listen up, she is one of Starr's friends, she's hungry for it, man. Give her a slice. - Before he finds someone who will girl, 'cause you know they always do. Fucking men. - Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Um, I guess we'll have to see. - Oh, shit we gotta go.

Not my fault this time. - Hey, here we go. Ay. - Stella! - About fucking time. - Nice. - What's up? - Oh, is that Yuri's sister? - Larissa, yeah. You haven't met her yet? - No, not yet, but, uh, Yuri's parents were saying something about getting her out of the house more. - So we gotta babysit just so her parents can get laid, great. - What? Who's getting laid? - Not you. - What? What did I do? - Do you have any idea how long we've been waiting? - What 15 minutes? Plus Yuri was the one driving. - Whatever. You smell like you bathed in bong water. - Hey. - Hey, babe. - Hi. - How are you doing? - I'm good. How you doing? - Doing well. - Good. - You look really pretty today. - Thank you. - I'll grab these bags. That. - Hey, guys, come on, let's go.

Um, yeah, it's nice to finally meet you. - Likewise. - We can go swimming. - Yeah. - I, I didn't bring my trunks, but we can always skinny dip. - Yeah, I'm down for it, sure. - Cool. Well, let's go. Well, you know I used- - Let's just head to the river. - Well, yeah. I used to be a little skinnier, but I gained about 50 pounds so I think this time I'll be chunky dunking. - Maybe it will help you float. - Oh, it will. Oh, it's like that old movie. They all float if they got the belly. - Yeah, I don't think that's the movie that you're talking about, but. - But, but wasn't that like that, that movie called "That"? - No, it's called, "It". - "It". - It is. - "It Is"? I've never seen it "It Is". - How much longer? - Uh, that was mile marker 43 back there, so like 15-ish. - Minutes? - No, seconds. - So what you reading there, Larissa? - "Dracula". - "Dracula" like the movie? - It was a novel first. Bram Stoker. It's a classic. - Oh, oh, that's cool. Um, uh, what do you think? - It's great. - Uh, could never read in the car. It makes me sick. - Reading in general makes you sick. - What is your fucking problem? - What? Come on, babe. - You're always teasing me. - Well, I'm so sorry. - Shh. - I got just the thing for this, dude. Dude, the spliff. - Good. - Light it up, man. - Good thinking. - There we go. - All right. - All right. - Yeah, finally let's get this shit started.

Fuck. - There you go, babe. - Yeah, we're gonna get stoned before we hike though. - Yeah, a little buzzy buzz for the road never hurt anybody. - It's the only way I can enjoy nature to the fullest. - Shit. Oh, babe, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm good. - Oh, fuck. - Yeah, thanks. Larissa. - No, thanks. - Oh, come on, loosen up a little bit. - No, thank you. - Larissa, really it's not that strong. You're fine. - I don't want to. - Uh, yeah, that's, that's fine. Yeah, that's cool. Here. - Gracias. - Yeah. I don't usually smoke that much anyway. Not since high school. - Oh, rude much. - Yee-haw. - There have been additional updates regarding the meteorite 247 collision that occurred in the early hours of the morning. It is being said to have been the largest space rock to hit the Earth in modern record. When a meteorite unknowingly entered into the Earth's atmosphere breaking apart somewhere above the Cascade Mountain range. The impact registered nearly a 3.0 on the Richter scale. State authorities today give thanks that it hadn't fallen through a large populated area. An expedition team headed by top geologists from the University of Washington will be dispatched to recover the fallen star as early as next week. Pinpointing the exact location of the crash site may prove to be harder than it would be otherwise if the meteorite hadn't fallen into such a dense wooded. - Ooh, Buzz, let me get one. - All right. - Thank you. - Uh- huh. - Hot girl, start early like a badass. - Yeah, you know vacation right. - All right, everybody just about there. - Ah, finally. - What do you folks say to one more spliffy iffy to christen the journey? - I say yes. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I might be asleep by the time we get halfway up the mountain. - Oh. - Oh, well, I got just the perfect pick me up for that. - What do you got, boy? - This is what I got. - Hey. - Oh, fuck. - Shit, babe, you had a eight ball this entire time. - Hey, baby, I'm a man of many mysteries. - Yes. - Dude, we're fucking sprinting up the mountain now. - Oh, you bet your fucking ass. - Whoo! There's just so many of 'em, I don't know what to get. Whoo. - Ugh. Oh, I need to wake up. - Bullshit. You sure you don't want some? - Oh, yeah. - Nah, I'm, I'm good. Thank you. - Suit yourself. - Wait, have you ever done a line? - Um, not since I, uh, party with Patrick Bateman, no. - Who? - It was a joke. - Oh, "American Psycho", great movie. - The book was better. - All right, y'all, let's head out. We can take shifts carrying the cooler. And Buzz, since you're on that superhuman shit you can take the first shift. - No fucking sweat. - Wait, how far is it? - Uh, like a mile and a quarter. - Well, my workout app says that I walk 1.3 miles an hour, so like 15 minutes-ish. - That's on a flat surface. We'll be hiking up an incline. - But my phone says I walk four miles an hour. - Yeah, but not up hill. The altitude and the incline will reduce that by at least half and that's not even factoring in all the dope you just smoked. - Say like 30 maybe 40 minutes. - OMG. I just wanna party. - Relax, baby. Look, why don't you have a beer. It'll make you feel better. - Okay. Thank you. - Let's get a fucking move on guys. Come on, let's go. - Hey. Ow. Ow! Oh, shit! - Look at that shit. - You know what's with you and that stick? - What you don't know? - Know what? - Oh, shit, dude, you haven't told her. - No. - Seriously, you always get sympathy with that story. - Whoa, what story? - Yuri almost died. - What? - And that Gandalf cane of his saved his life. - What? What happened? - So, uh, a few years ago I, um, I joined this hiking club, and we went on trips all over. Mostly around the Cascades in Oregon and Washington. And, uh, one day about the, uh, the middle of the spring we decided to go and hike up Mount Rainier. Now probably not the best time weather wise to go summiting a mountain over 10,000 feet. But we were going for it. And um, about halfway through the day this huge storm cloud just rolls in over the entire side of the mountain we're on. And it looked like that video game "Silent Hill". I mean I shit you not you could not see more than a foot in front of your face. And I started hearing this buzzing sound coming from the side of my head, so I had thought it was a bee. So I took my hat off and start swatting at what I assumed was a bee. But that I realized that's not what it was at all. It was the metal grommet in my hat reacting to the static electricity in the storm cloud. Betsy, one of the other hikers with us, she had these metal ski poles, they started buzzing as well. And it was at that time we realized we had to get the hell out of there. - Dude, you got struck by lightning. - No, no, I just, I got lost. We all started hustling to get down and out of that mountain, and I wasn't really paying attention to where I was going. I mean I couldn't fucking see anything. And um, yeah, after a while I realized I was just deep in the forest by myself way off the trail. And the sun was going down, I was alone. - Jesus. That's, uh. - Yeah, I really started to freak, which is, um, not what you're supposed to do. Started leaving behind pieces of my gear as a marker that I had been there or something. It was dumb, but I mean I was getting desperate. Something like 50 hours I had been just wandering in the complete opposite direction of the campsite. And, uh, when the search helicopter found me they said, "The only reason they did was because of this stick right here." I was waving my t-shirt around on it. Only reason they found me, so now I never leave home without it. - Such a harrowing tale. - Yeah, you're like the guy who cut his arm off. - Uh, Aron Ralston. - Oh, for real, now that you know the damn story he's gonna compare it to everything. Last year he had food poisoning, and I'm telling you right now he would not shut the fuck up about his tenacious will to survive. - Yeah, Yuri, I have reservations about you being the one leading us. - I got this, dude. - Ah, baby, I can't believe you haven't told me that story. - Yeah, well, according to these assholes I talk about it too much so. Yeah, fuck you too, guys. All right, y'all ready to head out or what? - Yes! - So I swear I'm not being a dick, bro, but are you sure you know where we're going? It's been about an hour now. - We're on the trail. We're fine. - No kidding. I thought this was Park Avenue. - We're almost there, okay? Have a beer it'll make you feel better. - Yeah, I'd like some fucking Gray Paw. - It's funny. - No, it's not funny. - Yes, it is, it's hilarious. - Fuck you, buddy. - Oh! - What the fuck? - Holy shit. - Greetings fellow hikers. - Uh, fuck. Hey. - Uh, sorry if we spooked ya. We just heard some talking and came down to ask if that was your campsite up there. - Campsite? - No. - No, no. - Yeah, somebody vandalized it or something. Uh, we waiting around for the owners to come back but they never showed up. - You didn't happen to pass you on your way up did ya? - Um, nah, we didn't see anybody. - Okay, well, I think we better, uh, get going. - Y'all said it was just up, uh, up that way, right? - Yeah. - Can y'all show me? - Yeah, sure. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Maybe splitting off the trail isn't the smartest idea. - Y'all stay here, I'll be right back. - Uh, I'll, I'll go with you. - All right. - Yeah. - Be sure to drop some breadcrumbs so you don't lose your way. - All right, where's this at? - It's just over here, uh. Uh, uh, the campsite's just up around here. - Oh, wow. - I know right? Maybe it's abandoned. A homeless camp or something. - Jesus. And it looks torn apart. The critters must have had a field day. I just hope whoever this belongs to is all right. - Could it have been a bear attack? - Nah, there aren't really any bears out here. - Plus there isn't any blood or anything. I mean the entire place looks pretty clean. I don't think anyone was hurt. - Yeah, I'm more worried someone got lost. - What's good? - Ah, just an abandoned campsite. - Yeah. - Well, hey, we're staying at cabin just up the trail head. We'll keep our eyes out for any hikers. - Okay, well, we better get going before it gets too late. Uh, it was really nice meeting y'all. - You too. - You too. - Good luck. Have fun. - Thanks. You too. - All right, y'all ready? - I've been ready. I need to get out of these shoes and make a drink like yesterday. - Fucking finally. - I hear that. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Yeah. - A dating app or? - Oh, yeah, you're like my fifth person this week so. - Oh, wow. I've never done it before so, uh. - Don't worry it's not- - I hope I'm a good one. - It's fine. - Oh. - You're good, you're fine, don't worry, but- - This- - We won't be making out later, so- - But- - I wanna tell you that now. - But, well, I mean I've never kissed a girl before so. - Hey, look, I, I have to go use the restroom, so, I'll, I'll be back.

It's nice and quiet. - Not for long. - I'll show everybody's, uh, rooming arrangements. - No. - Oh, yeah, the rooms. Yes. - I might actually be jealous. - Let's get that locked down. Starr and Buzz can have this room down here. They, uh, get loud, so I'm not dealing with that shit. All right, Larissa, this will be your room here. It's the master, so you can have your own privacy if you need it. - Thanks, bro. - Yeah, you like it? - Yeah, it's perfect. - Awesome. - Whoa, you get your own bathroom and everything.

It's the room so. - Sounds good. - Yeah, um, I mean like I totally can, uh, sleep on the couch if it's weird. - Oh, no, it's okay. - I mean I just don't want you to think I might you know. - Just, just stop talking. - That works, uh-huh, yeah. - I love this.

And we got strip UNO. Ooh, man, my dick cannot take a whole weekend of this let me fucking tell you right now. - Dude, you keep talking about strip UNO like it's a real thing.

No, thank you. - Oh, fucking whatever, dude. Let's fucking drink, bitches! - Hey, is someone there? Hey, is someone there? - Like serious she might actually have some friends if she wasn't such a Debbie Downer. - She obviously doesn't get out of the house much. Yeah, she seems pretty insecure too. - Well, shit I would be too if I had the fashion sense of Howdy Doody. Like seriously overalls? I mean just because it's in the bin doesn't mean you need to buy it. - Um, just, just be nice, okay? Please just attempt to look like you're trying to include her for Yuri's sake. - Okay, I've just never seen somebody in more need of getting laid, except maybe for you. - Hey, y'all still wanna make me that drink? - Oh, shit, Larissa has joined the club. - Yeah, you want, you want one shot or two? - Two, I'm not an invalid. - Here you go.

Oh, come on, I got prime rib at home why would I go out for a hamburger? - I don't understand what you're saying. - Yeah, it's like every time we bring up another chick you start talking about meat. Like steak and hamburger, I don't get it. - I like hamburger. - You like hamburger. - It's turn a phrase. - A what? - Turn a phrase. - How the fuck does one turn a phrase? - Yeah, are you sure?

I think that's the first time I've ever seen her drunk. - Shit, me too. Glad she had a good time though. - Yeah. - You know she doesn't really do this very often. Fuck, I don't think she ever has. - Hmm, okay. Never have I ever had a threesome with, with two men. - Oh. Goddamn, guys. - What can I say, senior year was ridiculous. - Sounds like it. - Yeah, and that time it wasn't even with each other. - Okay, stories, stories. Oh, my gosh.
