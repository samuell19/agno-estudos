look at that. It must have rained all night. Wouldn't you know it? Come back to bed. No. It won't take long. I know, honey. I wonder if they're up yet. I can't see her getting up too early, can you? He gets up early. That was in life magazine. Caroline and John-John come in to play. Christ, lurene. I haven't even had my coffee yet. creep! Hold on. God. Hold on. Oh, God! Be careful! I am being careful, Mrs. Heisenbuttel. I don't think that really hurt you. Oh... Ray! Come on, honey. There's going to be traffic. Lord. I'll help you. I'll help you. Be careful, now. Come on. All right. Watch your head. Ah! There. O.K. Oh! Ray! I'm coming. I'm coming. Can you get this? Yeah. Good morning, miss heisenbuttel. Good morning. Excited about seeing your president? She's real excited. Thank you for letting your wife take me, Mr. Hallett. It means so much we couldn't say no. We're going to be late, hon. We have a brilliant sun, and it has turned into a comfortable situation for the hundreds who came to Dallas' love field to witness the arrival of the president and his first lady. Excuse me! Excuse me! Wheelchair case! Excuse me. I'm sorry. She's paralyzed. I am not. Excuse me. May I help you, ma'am? Oh, thank you. She's a lifelong democrat. She still votes every time. She's been bumping my feet against everybody. Thank you so much. This is the high point of her life. Let us through, please. Thank you. Thank you. She doesn't have much time. Come on, Jackie. Jackie! Jackie! Is that Johnson? Who cares? She looks wonderful. I have the pattern to that suit. We have the same tastes. Please shake our hands. Jackie! My bag. My bag! Lurene, my bag's gone. I said keep it on your lap. My bag is gone. What a beautiful suit. I love that color. Get out of my way. Oh, Mrs. Kennedy, please. Oh, my God. Did you get the bag? I'll keep it this time. You spoke to them? They seemed like a nice couple. Watch out. My God. What's wrong with him? Hey! You guys know what happened? Over the radio. It's on the TV. Something's wrong. Continued clearing with a less than 5% chance... the president was shot. As his car followed from downtown Dallas to the hospital. Senator yarborough told newsmen that he heard three shots. He did not see where they came from, but he thought he heard three. He said he then saw a secret serviceman beating his fists on the president's limousine. Senator yarborough told newsmen it was too horrible to describe. He did tell reporters that both governor connally and the president were gravely injured. The president appeared to have been shot in the head. Senator yarborough, as we say, was three cars back from the president's car. His limousine followed to the hospital. He only saw the attendants at the hospital carrying the president into the hospital. At the airport in Dallas and throughout the streets, the police had been augmented by 400 policemen called in on their day off because there were some fears and concerns in Dallas that... that there might be demonstrations, at least, that could embarrass the president. It was only on October 24 that our ambassador to the united nations, adlai Stevenson, was assaulted there. Jackie's all right. He'll pull through. You'll see. From Dallas, Texas, the flash, apparently official, president Kennedy died at 1 P.M. central standard time, 2:00 eastern standard time, some 38 minutes ago. Vice president Johnson has left the hospital in Dallas but we do not know to where he has proceeded. Presumably, he will be taking the oath of office shortly and become the 36th president of the United States. President Kennedy at Dallas airport this morning was cheerful and waving. The casket... the casket carrying the body of president Kennedy is being transferred to a waiting ambulance there at Andrews air force base. There you can see Mrs. Kennedy. Oh, my God. It's blood. Bloodstains... Oh, Jackie. Behind Mrs. Kennedy you can see the late president's brother Robert. The ambulance is pulling out... I guess I should have called when I heard, huh? That's o.K. Now we'll be hearing from the 36th president. I know you understand what they mean to me. This is a sad time for all people. We have suffered a loss that cannot be weighed. I can't stand him. I'm sorry. I never could. Deep personal tragedy. I know that the world shares the sorrow that Mrs. Kennedy and her family bear. I will do my best. That is all I can do. I ask for your help. You want me to take you out to dinner or something? No. I want to see where they're burying him, Boston or Washington. What's the difference? I got bean-and-bacon and clam chowder. What are the maps for, baby? Do you want them mixed? Baby. All right. All right. I think we should go to the funeral. What? The president's funeral. You could be back to work by Tuesday or Wednesday. I'm on call, like I told you. Bob could cover for you. It could be a second honeymoon. Remember the cherry trees in Washington? It would be nice going there. We deserve a second honeymoon. I'll take you to new Orleans. I have to see her. He was my president, the only one I voted for. Because he looked like a movie star. It was more than that. The new frontier. She got me through the baby. You know she did. I'd be dead if it wasn't for her. Don't talk like that. You can watch it on the TV. You'll get a better view. Fix your own goddamn soup! I don't need you. I'll go by myself. Damn it, lurene! You've got to stop this crazy stuff! You are not going anywhere! That's the end of it! I didn't mind you taking my car and driving to the airport, and I know that old lady didn't make you take her, but this here, this is crazy. I can't let you. I'm putting my foot down. You go too far, is all. Well, thank you for your opinion and your sympathy. If you're finished spitting on me... Jesus h. Christ! I wish you'd watch your language, especially today. Feel better? Mr. Kennedy's parents, Joseph and rose Kennedy, are in seclusion tonight at their hyannis port, Massachusetts, home. They learned of the news of the assassination of their son from a workman at the house who heard it over the radio. They immediately went into that seclusion. Attorney General Robert Kennedy, the president's younger brother and his closest advisor, was having lunch at his home when the tragic news reached him. The president's other brother, senator Edward Kennedy, was presiding over the senate when word of the assassination reached him. He and his sister, eunice shriver, flew to hyannis port to be with their parents. Memphis, Nashville, Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York, boarding at gate 12-a. Last call for greyhound 176. Take care. Enjoy your trip. Greyhound 176 for Memphis, Nashville, Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York, departing immediately from gate 12-a. Last call for greyhound 176. Honey, go ahead and eat it. Don't play with it. It'll be a long time before you get something else. Don't do that. He should've waited till you sat down. That's all right, ma'am. What a sweet little girl. I'm afraid she's half-asleep already. It's poodle cloth. Oh, poodle cloth. I've heard of that. It's very fashionable in New York. And I love your suit. It's so pretty. Thank you. I made it. No. You couldn't possibly. I can't sew a bit. I'll see you up the road. Want a section? No, thank you. Operator, I understand why the circuits are busy. I am calling back. Would you just try the call again? Good morning. They don't say where they're burying him. I heard not till Monday. They'll lay him out in the white house first. Butterfinger's a nickel, right? Yeah. A nickel. Attention, please. Greyhound 176... Just a minute, baby. Roanoke, Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, Newark, and New York. The bus leaves in 10 minutes. Can I help? I'll take your little girl in with me. We don't want to trouble you any. Oh, no. It's no trouble at all. I've got to go. Announcing greyhound 176 to Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, roanoke, Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, Newark, and New York. Thank God. I thought she was putting down roots. You o.K. In there, honey? Is there paper? There's never paper. Oh. There you are. You know, that woman next to you didn't even wash her hands. Can you believe that? She's on our bus. Two seats up, on the right. Has a big fat purse on the seat so no one can sit next to her. That kind of person really gets my... Thank you, ma'am. What's her name? Jonell. Oh, jonell, you've got a pretty name. Let's see. I bet that's Joan Ellen, right? It's just like me. I'm lurene... Louise Irene. I just kind of ran it together, don't know why. Does she know about the assassination? Yeah. I talked to her about it. Because she seems so quiet. I think that's how children handle things. They go inside. I love children. I lost a baby this summer, like Jackie. I'm sorry. My husband says I talk too much about it. Announcing the continuation of greyhound 176... If you'd like, send her over to me. I'll read her the comics. We should get back. Excuse me. What time do we get into D.C.? They told me in Dallas, but this looks different. All right. Monday morning, Oh... That's cutting it close. Maybe I ought to go straight on to Massachusetts. The president... I'm going to the funeral, if they ever figure out where it will be. It won't be in Massachusetts. Washington. Probably Arlington. Oh. Where's that? Across the river in Virginia. It's the national cemetery for veterans. That makes sense. He was a war hero, you know. Yeah. I heard that. Are you going, too? No. We're just going home. It's going to be a hard Thanksgiving. He did a lot for the negro. Right. Do you want this? I'm finished. It's got lots of pictures. Oh... Thanks. You're welcome. It's understood that arrangements are underway for the burial of the president in Arlington national cemetery. Ma'am. Ray. Oh, jeez. You scared me, just like the boogeyman. Coming up to spring creek. 10-minute stop. Oh, thank you. This whole thing has just got me... I just keep thinking... Maybe it's all not real. They said on the radio that they'll bury him in Arlington. Well, you win. That's my husband ray. It's his trophy, like a prize. It's hard to see. It's a little naked man bowling. Oh, and that's hazel. She owns the beauty parlor I work for. That streaky part's a rinse I tried, and that's me. Well, I know, but the dress looks good. Excuse me, ma'am. That's enough now, jonell. Don't bother the lady. She's too quiet to be a bother. I was the same way at her age. Wouldn't open my mouth to anyone. Maybe she'll grow out of it, too. You can stretch out in the back. Here, hon. Let's go. Thank you, again. Mm. One good thing about a bus, puts you right to sleep. Excuse me. Oh. I can never sleep in a car. Ray, my husband... he has a nice car, but he couldn't come. He wanted to, but work and all. Isn't it sad, what happened? Caroline turns 6 next Wednesday. Isn't that sad? Yeah. Yours is about 6, isn't she? I almost had a little girl, but I... I told you already. I'm sorry. That's o.K. I only know her first name. Johnson. I'm Paul Johnson. I'm Mrs. Hallett. Driver, on your left. Aah! Are you all right? Yes, I think so. Thank you. You o.K., hon? Oh, my God. Now, what exactly did you see? I was asleep. Mr. Johnson must have seen it. Any chance of a lift? Sorry, but I'm turning off just up here. I don't see him anywhere. Oh, Mr. Johnson! What are you doing? They said to stay. Here's your doll, honey. She's fine. Not even a scratch. She was on the floor. What's he want? You saw everything. Shit. They needed witnesses. Just tell him what you saw. Identification? Sure. "Paul cater." Didn't you say Johnson? Uh, I... I always get names wrong. That school bus there, that's taking y'all to the depot in readyville. Lieutenant's on his way there. I want you there, boy. What time's this one get into D.C.? About 11:00 on Monday morning. O.K. Thank you. Yes, ma'am? 11 A.M. that's o.K. That's good. What are you doing, honey? Tell me, sweetie, is your last name Johnson? I guess your daddy's playing games on me, huh? I don't know what to believe anymore. They killed the president. I almost shook his hand, and they... they killed him. I'm lying to the police, and people are lying to me. My husband's ready to divorce me. I can't do this. I can't do this anymore. Sorry, honey. I'm just a little sad. Did your mamma die? No, honey. I'm just a little sad about the president and all. Well... You do know how to talk, don't you, hmm? Well, that's good, honey. That's nice. Now we don't have to be shy anymore. Did your mamma die? You poor thing. Here, I've just been blabbering on, feeling sorry for myself. Come on. We've got some time before the bus. Want a Coca-Cola? Come on. When did you see the car? I was in the back of the bus. We know. There you go. Let's get our picture taken. Want to? That's a 1960 Chevrolet. A white Chevy. Folks, there will be a short layover... Oh, that's a good one of you. Oh, I knew my eyes were closed. Honey, you've got some blood on your head. How come we didn't see that? Come on. From the back of the bus, you witnessed a 1960 Chevrolet impala, which you referred to as a white Chevy, attempt to pass and then eventually pass a 1962 light green Pontiac or oldsmobile. Ow. What? Are you hurt over here, too? Let me see. Here you're making an assumption that the pickup was making an attempt to avoid a collision with the 1960 Chevy impala. At this time, you hollered something, you don't recall what, to the bus driver. Who is he, jonell, huh? Now, honey, I'm your friend, o.K.? Is jonell your real name? It's not Johnson. Is it cater? Is jonell cater right? No. Look, I told you I went to get my little girl. Mr. Cater, the Tennessee highway patrol did not send me out here at night to play games. We will have a complete statement from you of everything that you witnessed. You understand me? Yes, sir. That's good. Long distance. Operator, this is an emergency. How may I help you? Who do I talk to about a kidnapping? What city? Dallas, Texas. Hold the line. I'll connect you. Hello? Federal bureau of investigation. Please state your name. Lurene hallett. Ma'am? All I want to know is if you have a little colored girl missing. I don't want to cause trouble. Anyone report that? About 5 years old? Yes, ma'am. Could you please give us the number you're calling from? Let me see. Uh, kl5-6422. There's a little colored girl here. She's traveling with this colored man, and there's something wrong. Who did you call? Excuse me? Just then. Who did you call? If you must know, Mr. Cater, if that's who you are, I tried to reach my husband... If it's any of your concern, which it's not. Me and my little girl will be going now. She says she's not your little girl. And don't you pull her away. There's people all around here, and I'll scream, I swear. She spoke to you? Maybe you said not to, but she did, didn't you, sweetheart? Well, she did before. Her name's not cater or Johnson. You're not her father. I am her father, Mrs. Hallett. She just doesn't understand that yet. She's confused. Her mother died suddenly. I know about that, and I know about the bruises. What else have you seen? Have you seen her run from me? Have you seen her pull away? See who she comes to. I've seen you act like a guilty man. Honey. Tell this lady who I am. When did I bring you the doll? Remember Monday? And this. Remember I showed you these that day? Huh? Who is that, huh? Is that mamma? Who hurt you, honey? Was it this man? No. I took her from the county home. Somebody there beat her. I don't know who, and I sure as hell wasn't going to leave her there. I can fight for her better back home. So now, Mrs. Hallett, if you'd just leave us alone, we'll be fine. It's just, when I saw the bruises... Oh, my God. What? The phone. That's the FBI. I gave them that number to call me back. Mister... hello. Kidnapping? You've got the wrong number. This is the readyville bus depot. Did you say you're from the FBI? Reckon you guys were busy. Mr. Cater! Shh... Mr. Cater, it was them. You've got to get out of here. It's my fault. I panicked. Look, if I asked you to watch jonell, would you do it and not call anyone? I won't make any calls. Honey, stay with her, all right? Maybe if I just tried to explain things... when we're gone, explain all you want to. Get my suitcase and meet me over there. Honey, do you know what his suitcase looks like? O.K. Come on. Go faster, o.K? Ladies and gentlemen, we regret the delay, however we're announcing the continuation of greyhound 176, servicing Nashville, Knoxville, roanoke, Washington, D.C., and connecting service to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. Bags are being transferred to the bus. Greyhound regrets the inconvenience and thanks you all for your patience. Hey, boy. I'm looking for a tall colored man and a little girl. Have you seen them? No. Come on. Come on. Final call for Knoxville, roanoke, and Washington, D.C. Final call, Knoxville, roanoke, and Washington, D.C. I can't stay any longer, see? I've got to be someplace. He'll be right here, honey. You're not scared, are you? Good-bye. You call me at this number. Just dial a zero and say it's collect, o.K.? If anybody hurts you or anything. O.K. I'm going to put it in your pocket. Final call for Knoxville, roanoke, and Washington, D.C. Final call for Knoxville, roanoke, and Washington, D.C. May I have your attention, please? Folks, didn't anyone on this bus see where the colored man with the little girl went? Who's missing? That white woman. Very friendly with them. Do you know her name? No, sir. Sort of skinny, very blonde hair. There's her suitcase. Take off. Where the hell have you been? You made me miss my bus. I never stole a car before. I think they checked the bus for you. She's out like a light. Of course, she's had a long day. It's o.K. You can go faster now. What is it? 40. 41, that's it. Couldn't you steal a good car? The one next to it wouldn't even start. Where'd you go looking, a repair shop? You're kidding me. And you're flooring it? I wanted to buy a car like this, but ray wouldn't let me. What are you doing? Come on. Out. You can wave somebody down. You don't want to get mixed up in this. I'm not mixed up in anything. I didn't ask you to get this car, but seeing as you did and you made me miss my bus... I didn't "get" this car, I stole it. That's a felony. Well, it shouldn't be if it can't go over 40. And kidnapping. You've got the FBI down on my ass! You'll be an accessory to kidnapping. You want that? I want to go to my president's funeral! What I want is to go to that rotunda and file past that coffin and pay my respects. How can you think of setting me down in lord-knows-where after all I've tried to do? You owe me. Owe you! Jesus! I know you're going to Philadelphia. I read your luggage tags. It's on your way. When I saw you bearing down on me in that bus, I should have run. You feel sorry for some people. Sorry for me! They keep dogging you and dogging you! Look, this is not going to work. You've got to get out. I'm doing what's best for you. And it's for my own good. I hate when I'm told that. Sometimes they're right. Come on. Out. I know your name, and I have just memorized your face. The license plate on this car has two 8s and a 2 in it. You don't have a choice. You can catch the bus in Knoxville. Thanks, but no thanks. I ain't felony accessorizing to sit in another damn bus. Mr. Hallett, we'd like to talk to you about your wife. Noon, eastern time. The casket will be carried to the capitol... Military drummers will accompany naval personnel... Shut off the engine. The president's widow... Can you get it to go any faster? Well, I can try. They're taking him to the capitol today. I guess folks from around here will be up there already. Why would that be? It's less than a day's drive. Well, he did a lot for your people. Take a look around, ma'am. Look like he done much here? Jonell, now, you be careful! Man, I got no luck with cars. Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, there's bad luck that you run from and bad luck that you bring along with you. Hell, man. I only have to put up with her as far as Washington. You must be crazy, man. You got a white woman riding in your car around here. Have her ride in back. Heh heh heh. Well, that's an idea. As long as I have one of those wind-up windows because I tell you, the bitch can talk. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! It's a wonder her name ain't niagara falls. She runs like water. Keeps running. Busiest mouth I know. Ha ha ha! Quack, quack, quack. Sure hope your luck changes. Thanks, man. Can we just go now, please? I thought the negroes liked president Kennedy. Some did. You didn't. Nothing against the man. I just don't expect much from white folks. Oh. I think that's pretty prejudiced, if you don't mind my saying so. I don't mind. ¶ and the tree's in the hole haven't you heard that song? ray hates to travel. He says it puts too many Miles on the car. We went to Mexico once, but he's found the center of the universe on the living room couch. That's the trouble marrying someone you grow up with. You think you know things without asking him, like, "is it o.K. If I work?" Or, "without kids, "what do we talk about for the rest of our lives?" Or, "are you going to want creamed corn every night?" There you go. Thank you. Why didn't you marry her? I asked her to, but she knew I really didn't want to. You didn't? See, I was going back to the service for the pharmacy training program. Well, that's what I have on my mind when riva says she's pregnant. Well... I didn't even think about being a husband, never mind being... Being a father. She knew that. And, uh... She turned me down and went back home to Dallas. Didn't it kill you knowing she was growing up and you not seeing it? I had other things on my mind. Sure, I can see that. Look, I'd do the same thing again. It's crazy to think if I hadn't let her go, we'd all be together and she'd be alive. You got anybody now? No. Good-looking man like you? How come? I just don't have anybody right now, that's all. Must be lonely. Anyhow, I think she's the spit of you. This looks like a good spot, don't you think? I'll cover you with this map. I won't even look. Honey, go on. No one's going to see. I'll go, too. Watch. Mr. Cater, would you go around to the other side? Squat down. Look at that here! How far is tazewell? 45 Miles, maybe. I know people there. Hazel's folks. Hazel at the beauty parlor? Tazewell, Virginia. I remember now. They could help us. Why would they do that? Why not? Assassination or not, this country's full of good, trusting people. Besides, we don't have to tell them the truth. What's going on? Car trouble. Can we hitch a ride with you into tazewell? What's your business with him? Stand back, baby. He gave me a ride. Where you from, lady? Much obliged, gentlemen, but I'm going to get this car going quick. Thank you anyway. Can you fix it? Maybe. You know what? You'd get a ride up the road. Nobody's going to pick up the three of us. Go on. Well... I'll come back for you. You'll wait? Sure. We'll be right here. I'll be back. Can you help? I need to hitch a ride into tazewell. Hop in. Thank you. Let's go, baby. Now, we've got to go on, o.K.? You're going to be a big girl about that? You're going away, too, daddy? No, baby. Daddy's going to be right here with you. Daddy's never going to go away again. Come here. Baby, get in here and lie down, and don't look up, no matter what. Don't look up. Where's the woman? She got a ride into town. Where do you think you're going, boy? I don't want no trouble. He don't want no trouble! Hold him! Hold him! Ugh! Ugh! Ah! Hello, Mrs. Enright? Hello? Who is it? Mrs. Enright, it's lurene hallett. I'm a friend of hazel's. I work in the shop. Is it something with hazel? Oh, no, no. I saw her Friday evening. She's fine. I... Um... I'm just passing through, and... you're the girl that lost the baby, aren't you? Mrs. Enright, please, can I use your phone? Yeah. Ray, honey, it's me. Jesus, lurene! Thank God! Where the hell are you? Ray, I'm fine, um... I'm in a real hurry. The FBI said some colored guy grabbed you. That is not true. I... I'm just hitching a ride with him. That's why... you're hitching a ride? He's going to drop me in Washington. What the hell is going on? What are you doing? I'm going to the president's funeral, what else? And... And I was just wondering if you could get me some money here? Isn't there some way to do that? You listen to me, Louise Irene. You call the police and run. They will hunt that nigra down. Oh, for God's sake! You won't help? Fine! I was crazy to think you would. I'll call from the motel. What motel? Where we spent our honeymoon. Didn't you read my note? I read the goddamn note! If you had come with me, this wouldn't have happened. Get your ass back here, or I swear to God, I'm... I'm... I'm going to take you to some doctor for your head! Is everything all right? Do you have a car? Mr. Cater! Jonell? Let me talk to her first. She didn't expect me back till day after tomorrow. Mrs. Enright, it's me! Well, lurene, did that car let you down? Oh, no, no. Well, I'm glad you changed your mind. We don't get much company. I'm Paul cater, ma'am. This is my daughter, jonell. Come on in. They're taking him from the white house to the capitol. I don't want to be any trouble, ma'am. Iodine and everything for the doctor's in here in the front room with Cal. He don't speak much. That's where the stroke got him, but he hears you if you speak up. Where is the doctor's box, Cal? Maybe I can help find it. Lee oswald is being transferred... Do you know my daughter, too, Mr. Cater? No, ma'am. I'm not from Dallas. This it? There is Lee oswald. He's been shot! He's been shot! Oh, my God. There's the man with the gun. It's absolute panic here in the basement of the Dallas police headquarters. Detectives have their guns drawn. Oswald has been shot. There is no question. Oswald has been shot. Pandemonium has broken loose. It is almost unbelievable. It's almost unbelievable. Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy is... and her daughter... are walking up to the casket. This will be her last good-bye for today. And now Mrs. Kennedy and Caroline are walking slowly past the crowd, past president and Mrs. Johnson and the distinguished members of congress and the late president's cabinet, the justices of the supreme court, and Mrs. Kennedy and her daughter leave the capitol rotunda, leave the capitol building on their way back to the white house. We better get you fixed up. The public will begin filing past the casket. I don't know when we started killing people to solve things. I didn't know we stopped. Mr. Cater. Would your daddy let you come upstairs with me? There's lots of my daughter's old toys up there. Thank you, ma'am. Do you like dolls? I believe we can find you a little girl. I don't know how Jackie's bearing up. Well... Sorry, it's going to pull a little. I can't help it. Oh... First time I saw her, she... Kind of grabbed me. I'd be eating and imagine her eating... Or sitting in the bathtub or just walking down the street, and I'd think of her doing that, and it would be o.K. Sometimes ray would say something and I'd pretend it was Jack. It eased me, you know. See, I don't get ordinary life. When I went to Mexico that time with ray, everyone was talking Spanish, or Mexican. That's what the newspaper and the signs were in. I loved him that weekend. I almost felt that, because he wasn't understanding it either, and I thought, "honey, now you know." I guess you think I'm crazy. No, lurene, I don't think that. It's a policeman. Mrs. Enright? Who's in here? Hi! Can I help you? Is Mrs. Enright in? She's upstairs lying down. I don't want to wake her. Uh, well, we're looking for a nigger, ma'am. He's kidnapped a little girl and a white woman. A wh... a white woman? You sure? Yeah, FBI report. She's a Dallas woman. I got a name here somewhere. She tried to report him, so he took her. Oh. Anyway, we're just hoping we're not too late. Oh, yeah, sure. Well, there ain't no niggers here. He is in the area, ma'am. The car he stole from Tennessee was found on 61. A farmer and his sons tried to help him. Well, he nearly killed them. Who's down there, child? Carl swinson, ma'am. He pulled up here, I said to myself, "Jackie, my God, it's the police. Something must have happened back home in fredericksburg," but he's looking for niggers. We ain't seen nothing like that around here. Ma'am, that true? If you're the swinson boy, you know I can barely see. It's the same thing your grandma had. Now run along. I'm so tired, I'm fit to be laid up. Thank you, ma'am. He probably went back South to throw you off the track. He won't get far. We got roadblocks in three counties. Miss. Thank you, Mrs. Enright. I won't lie for you again. They got it all wrong. They'll have roadblocks from Lebanon to bluefield. They'll be down tomorrow morning. You and the child can sleep in hazel's room. Mr. Cater, sleep in the barn. Thank you, ma'am. We'll be leaving tonight. They got roadblocks. I'll just get my things. I'm sorry for the trouble. Let me fix the child a meal first. We'll be staying, ma'am, and we really do appreciate all you're doing for us. We can't leave yet. They're looking for you. I didn't mean you. Just jonell and me. What about me? You'll get to Washington. I'd bet my life on it. What are you going to do? Excuse me. It's because I called you nigger, isn't it? I did that to fool him. I didn't mean it. That's a load off my mind. Thank you for not meaning nigger and for putting the FBI on my ass and for bringing those crackers down on me. Hey, baby, thanks for that, too. Excuse me for not staying for the next time you're sorry. Stay for jonell's sake. Think of what's best for her. What's best for her is not your business. It wasn't yours either till a week ago. When you have a child, you can judge me. Until then, sit in your dream world where the first lady gives a fuck about you! Go to hell! I thought we understood each other. We're both running, aren't we? We're both wanting something more. Don't you dare think that we're the same. Being bored and being black are different. Do you hear that? Your life in Dallas, hell. That's open air my child may never breathe. Free to live where she wants, to drive north without hiding. Free to grow up as bored, stupid, or useless as any white woman. We are not the same! You did what you could for us. I know that, but it's more harm than good now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't. Everything's gone so wrong. Shh. That's the quietest child I ever did see. Mrs. Enright. She wouldn't let me bathe her or tuck her in. Do you know what you're headin' for, child? No. Then I feel sorry for you. Sorry for your husband, too. I'll expect you-all to be out of here as soon as it's light. I'll bring the car back day after tomorrow, if it's still all right. That'll be fine. Or you can drive it on down to hazel. It'll be hers soon enough anyway. No need for all that. We'll leave now. The child needs her sleep. First light's soon enough. It's that first room upstairs on the right. I left something clean for you to wear... one of hazel's old dresses. Good night, Mr. Cater. Good night, Mrs. Enright. Good night. Good night. And Mrs. Kennedy steps forward to light the eternal flame. Perhaps never in the history of the world have so many of the world's greats been gathered... Yes, sir? Uh, name's ray hallett. Mm-hmm. My... my wife check in yet? Thank you, Mrs. Enright. You forget something? Honey, I got to stay here, o.K.? Give me a kiss good-bye. Come on. What are you doing? They'll be looking for three. You're safer without me. Lurene. I'll be o.K. With them about the car. Uh... Just send me the money, and I'll get it to hazel. Bye. I'll be right back. We're almost home. We're almost home. You realize what kind of trouble you're in? You want everyone to read in the papers about you and some colored fella? Oh, ray! For God's sake! Are you going to shoot me 'cause I hitched a ride with a colored man? No white people stopped, o.K.? I didn't know what I'd find up here. Listen, honey, we got to talk, I know. Right now, I have me a real bad headache. Some beer and bufferin, I'll be fine. You want to get me some? What's out there? I'm just trying to see if we have a view of a monument or something. I'll get it myself. Just stay here and simmer down. I'm not letting you out of my sight! Now, I know you, lurene! We are going home, and you're going to listen to me. You're damn lucky you're not in jail already. What's the difference between jail and what we have? No! Let me go! Oww! Ow! Stop! Let me out of here! No! No! Let me go! It's the night manager, sir. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't you say anything. Excuse me, sir. Is everything all right? I heard some screaming. Uh... Yeah. It's, uh... It's just my wife. She's upset because of the president and all. Of course. Are you sure everything's o.K.? Everything's fine. Thank you. This is the guy. This is the guy! Paul, get out! Take the car! Don't move! Ray, please! Jesus, lurene! What did he do to you? Do you think I'd let him touch me? He gave me a lift! If you don't let him go, they'll say I took up with a colored man. You said it yourself. The papers will say it. I couldn't hold my head up. You shoot him, might as well shoot me. You're lying. I wouldn't! Not about this! Ray, ray. He never touched me. I felt sorry for the little girl, is all. Ray... I'll go with you. Let him go. I'll go back to Dallas with you tonight. O.K., honey? I give you my word. Let this nigger go back to where he came from. Oh, lurene... You're going to pay for what you did... aah! Ow! Get out!

I will, too. But he's your daddy, and he's been waiting for this for a long time. Teresa's dad is in jail, and he's never coming out. Well, that's where you're lucky. I got something else, too...

And I'm going to wear mine all the time. Maybe if you wear yours... We won't mind so much. It just feels bad now, honey. It'll get better. I promise. Mrs. Hallett? Mr. Cater. They didn't expect you till tonight. She won't be packed. I'll wait. You changed your hair. Oh, yeah, well, it's easier. Um, she's a little upset. You know, after a year, you get used to a place. You get to like it. Not every place. Oh, no. Of course not. How are you? I'm o.K. Yeah. I hate that word... divorcee. I always have. It's funny. Sometimes I miss ray.

I lie about it, Paul, you know, to the police, those people in there, everyone. I just want you to know... I've never been sorry. Never. I'm the same. Well, I better go. Good-bye. Hi. Hi, daddy.
