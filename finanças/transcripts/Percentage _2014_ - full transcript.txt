[WALLY] My wife did it. It was for my birthday. So what happened? [ANT] What you think happened? Shit went bad. Could have been worse. I need you to find out who set us up. Ant, I'm not your lawyer anymore. Asking those kinds of questions, it puts me in a difficult position. Look, you gonna be in a lot of difficult positions if you don't make that call. I'm the assistant district attorney now. I can't be calling in favors on behalf of a couple of criminals. Couple of what? Good, good friends. [ANT] Look, Wally. I don't say shit like this a lot. I need your help. All right, give me a minute. I'll see what I can find out. Ah, shit, nigga. Keep your voice down. Fuck you, I just got shot. You keep your voice down. Well? Well, they weren't looking for you. The Russians were importing their dancers into the country illegally. Human trafficking. You just picked the wrong night to do a deal. Cool, so we good. No, you are definitely not, uh, good. Would you put that money away? My wife and kid are upstairs. Thank you. They've subpoenaed the security footage, but they haven't gotten it yet. I don't know if they'll ID you from the tapes or not. We have a small window here. My advice? Disappear. Until we know more. Nah, we ain't running. This is going to go federal, Ant, and when it does, there's nothing more I can do for you. Please, leave town... I mean, a clean break. No phones, no dealing, no flashing cash all over the place. Go legit for a few months. The Feds have resources we don't and they'll have their ears up for anyone making noise anywhere. Cool. Chill on a hundred grand for a couple months. No, no. You don't even know if those bills are marked. Look, man, it took me a long time to get my business to where it is. Now you're telling me to just walk away. Ant. When I first met you, what did you have? What did I have? Please, listen to me. Your business isn't worth anything if you're behind bars. Maybe you have family somewhere, someone you can stay with? I got cousins in Miami. Okay. Miami. Sunshine State. [ANT] We're gonna need your car. My car? Yes. [MAN SINGING IN SPANISH] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [MAN] Gotta play it that way. Come on.

You know I ain't been out the joint that long and I ain't got that shit out my system yet... you heard? Only reason I'm picking up, nigga, is because I'm high. 'Cause if I wasn't, oh, oh... I would kung fu karate kick the shit out... Yah! Get the fuck out of here, nigga. Get the fucking dominoes. Flaco! Who the fuck is you? Hey, that's my cousin, bro. What up, cuzzo? [CARTER] There go, my nigga. [MAN] What it do? - Aw, shit. - Man, what happened to you? Got shot. This my nigga, Ant. Oh, hey man, what it do? What up? Damn. When you get married? [CARTER] Long story. Here, grab all your stuff out the car, come on in the house. Nah, that's all we got right here. Oh, you definitely got to tell me about this shit. This right here, this Sweets. This my man, Petey. And this big nigga right here, this Crisco. Why they call you Crisco? Hey, this nigga be in and out of prison so much, that's a question you probably don't want to know the answer to. What up? What you doing, man? Yo, you ain't got to worry about that. This my cousin. Man, I can't trust nobody. But you. Shit, if I find out these bills ain't marked, I'll buy 'em a new bed. Shit, I'll buy them a new bedroom. You need to relax, man. I need to relax. I need to relax? You got a slug in your motherfucking arm. I'm sleeping on a motherfucking couch. We just drove here 1500 motherfucking miles in a station wagon and now running with some nigga named Crisco. No, you fucking relax. [CARTER] What, you mad at me now? Not at you, man. Never at you. Damn, I feel like I'm balling. This shit remind me of back in the day when I was hustling. Enjoy yourself, nigga. [FLACO] Yeah, you know what, it's good to have you here, Cuz. Shit, both of y'all. Hell, my life. Same shit every day. Wake up, go to work, come back to this little house. It's good to have y'all here, for real. You know, we just gotta lay low for a while. Could be a minute. Aw, man, no, don't need to worry about that, man. Shit, stay as long as you want. Hell, if y'all start getting restless, y'all can just go to work with me. What you do? Credit card processing. This nigga probably swiping Visas at Burger King. No, man, look. I work for a processing bank. Businesses, they get charged a percentage and a fee every time they swipe somebody credit card, right? If they use our terminals, then we get the basis points. It's like tiny pieces of the penny. You know what I'm saying? Then we send them a statement at the end of the month with every transaction. Sounds boring as fuck. Yeah, it's boring as fuck. Shit, nigga, I'll pass. Shit, well, what about you, Ant? You want a job? Want to make some money while you're here? Fuck it. - Wait, you serious? - Fuck it. Well, shit, you start tomorrow then.

Well, Mr. Ant Ant, I've never had a presentation by a man of your stature. No offense. Your numbers are good and I'm intrigued, so it's a good start. Great. No, no, no, not so fast 'cause there's one little problem. What the fuck is the problem? Pardon me. How can I address your concerns? Well, you see, Mr. Ant Ant, I've been in this business a long, long time. When I started, I had nothing, so believe me when I tell you when a man come through my door, I don't care what he look like, I don't care how he talk, I don't care where he come from. If I see something in a man that I can trust, then we can do business. Huh, 'cause business just business, right? When a man come in my door and his watch cost more than my whole bottom line for a month, well, then I don't know if I can trust him. You understand? I tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give you my statements and I want you to come back in a couple of days with a full breakdown, all the numbers, on paper, summarized and then we see if we can do some business. All right? Oh, I'm sorry. I had to sneeze. Go, fat ass. Hold the fuck up, man. What up, Cuzzo? [FLACO] What up, man? Hey, I'm so proud of your boy. You should have seen him today. I think he made his first sale day one. Hmm. Hey, where your chain at? You done went corporate. Dancing for nickels. Yeah, well, at least he working. Maybe you should try that sometime. I hate that fucking ride. Hey, yo come on Ant, let's go work on this summary, man. Show you how to get this paperwork down. Yo, get rid of that shit. All right. My cousin owns a scrap yard and I'm driving for him. We'll go in a minute. Deal me in this time. [ANT] Flaco was excited to have me working for him. Too excited. But hey, I didn't have anything else to do. So I kept working. Most sales pitches went the same way. We asked if they are happy with their service, tell 'em we can beat their rates and offer to draw up a summary. But the one thing I couldn't understand is these businesses would give us their statements to draw up the summary and they had every credit card transaction that the business did that month. Every credit card name, every credit card number. And all that money, before it went to vendors or MasterCard or Visa or whatever, it went through Flaco's bank.

I like that. But you know what, your friends? He is gone. You know, me and my nigga Carter, we been looking out for each other for a while now. He can hold his own. Yeah, but the other boys? The ones that look like they ain't never been out the hood? Maybe they never had the chance. [WOMAN] It's not about chances. It's about what you do with them. Some people just ain't hungry. What about you? - What about me? - You saw me with them. You came after me. [WOMAN] Yeah, I did. It's 'cause you're different. You brought them there. Gave them something that they wouldn't have without you. Something they probably couldn't handle without you. The world is yours, Ant. And you might as well just go ahead and take it. You sure you're not ready to leave? What about your friend? What about her... she's a big girl. I'm pretty sure she can handle that. Here, come here, let me show you how a king should be treated. Excuse me, excuse me, hey, hey. Are you finished talking with my man right here? You trying to get the other side fucked up? Shit ready for Halloween. All right. Get your own, son. I could have sworn I seen her looking at me. Is that what you saw? [ANT] The hustle, it's like food to me. And when you don't eat in a couple weeks, it don't take much. Just the smell of food and you can't stop yourself. You want everything in sight. ♪ Living the fast life ♪ [ANT] I heard people say they wish they could go back, start over now that they're grown, knowing what they know now. But I never understood it till now. This wasn't our city, so we started slow. Slow enough to get the word out and get us known. Throwing scraps in the water to see what size fish come around. It didn't take long for the first shark to come around. Duke was a small time hustler from Mendocino with eyes bigger than his wallet. He linked us in with a network of commercially-licensed growers from California. I mean, an army of white boys, all growing the finest engineered strains of piff, right under the government's nose. Carter and I never seen anything like it. I mean, it's damn near perfect. They sold legally to medicinal dispensaries under Prop 215. By over reporting their sales just a little, between all of them, they could skim hundreds of kilos and legally grown and shipped them east to sell them for more than anything we could get from the city. Before long, the money flooded in, tsunami style. You all right, nigga? I should karate chop your ass into a motherfucking diet, nigga. Yah! [PETEY] Fat motherfucker. Damn, nigga, quit. I ain't never smoked no shit like this before. I don't even feel like I'm breathing. - Am I breathing, man? - Yeah, you're breathing. Your stomach moving, nigga, you breathing, motherfucker. Mmm. Shit, man, I'm fucking dying. I'm dying from fucking weed poisoning. Nigga, you can't OD off of no motherfucking weed. [PETEY] Food, you can, but not no weed, nigga. Yo, man, stop playing. Flaco's gonna be back here in a minute. Petey, clean up the rest of that weed, man. How you gonna be running shit out of this nigga's house and he don't know, son? [PETEY] When are you going to tell him? He'll know when he need to know. And when is that, nigga? Now's good. Oh shit. Flaco, what up, man? Yo, what the fuck is this? How was work today? Yo, Ant. - Yo Carter, what the fuck is this shit, man? - What up, cousin? Yo, what the fuck are y'all doing in my house, man? Sit down. No, not until you tell me what the fuck all this shit is. Sit down. Didn't you tell me the other night this is the way you want to live? Yeah, but I was drunk, Ant. I was fucking drunk. I could fucking get robbed, I could go to prison. I could fucking lose every fucking thing I have... This is nothing. No, this is my home. Matter of fact, I invited you into my home. As a matter of fact, all y'all get out. Get your shit and get out. Everybody get the fuck out. Get out, man. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Yo, yo, Flaco, I'm sorry about that, man. Wanna hit this? Why don't you take this? Maybe this will ease the pain you're feeling right now. I don't want your money. Yes, you do. Everybody wants my money. But it's mine and I'm giving it to you. Now I'm going to pack all of this shit up and I'm gonna get it out your house and I ain't gonna deal piff no more. What? What? You see this? This from Mendocino, California. Grown legally, legit. Now the growers, they take a little bit off each batch. Not enough to be worth anything, not enough to get noticed. Pennies. Understood? It's a legitimate business and the clients don't know a thing. Pennies. Now you, you got access to central banking records and credit card accounts for several of your clients and your company? They got access to thousands more and all we want? Pennies. Wait, hold on, Ant. Are you asking me to rob my processing bank? Yes. [ANT] Millions of times a week. Wow. Look, I don't... Ant, I don't know, man. I don't even have access to those accounts like that, except when I'm at work. And even then, all the computers are monitored. But then you got the clients and the customers and the bank. They might notice that, man. If they do, yo, man, that shit is crazy, man. I don't even know how to do it. Me neither. But if you hungry, you gonna find food, right? I can't, man. Oh well, thank you for your hospitality and we'll be in touch. All right? Come on, son. Yo, what the fuck was that? Business, nigga. - That's my cousin, nigga. - And? He want in whether he realize it or not. Yo, we been through the fire and you know I'll follow you wherever, my nigga. But that nigga? You scared the shit out of him, man. He ain't ready for all that. But you are though, right? And I am. So something gotta give, nigga. Fuck it. Let's go get an apartment. Not bad, not bad. This'll work. Nice little view. What the fuck? Door was open, man, just delivering the order. [PHONE RINGING] Who this? So is that flat screen gonna be big enough for you? Listen, why don't you and Carter come downstairs? I have somebody I want you to meet. All right. Come on, we out. This crazy. What the fuck was that? What's up, what's up. How you knew we was here? Ya'll know where we get our money from? Don't matter. Don't ask, don't tell, right? - You are funny. - It's Tyson's. Yo, who the fuck is Tyson? Relax. It ain't like that. You fucking Tyson too? Are you serious? No, I'm not fucking Tyson. You know I'm a greedy motherfucker. I don't like sharing. I do now. - This is our car. - Uh-huh. I'm really gonna need you to trust me. We're gonna take you on a special trip. Where we going? For a ride. - I ain't getting in the car. - Get in the car! How about I drive? I'll follow you. From the backseat. [JACKIE] Ant, tell him you want to go. Get in the car, come on! [JACKIE] Move it.

There's no Tyson. Is there? Oh, there's thousands of them, small and hard and with a flick of a wrist, they bring me money faster than I ever thought possible. And they can do the same for you, don't you know? So you been watching me. No, not at first. I watch your cousin because sometimes I watch people I think maybe I can use, but Flaco is weak. Weak mind and weak will. But then I hear somebody new come to town and I start to watch you. And you are strong. Mmm. So you sent Cassandra after me. No. No, Cassie is a big girl. I don't send her after you. She's strong herself. Anyway, she think we have similar interests. Like what? She says you're a hungry man, like a lion. I like a man with appetite. What? Maybe you don't understand me. My father is Jamaican and my mother's from Minnesota and I was raised in the South. So everybody say I talk like a Muppet, you know? But I want you to come work for me. Well uh... Call me Mama Cash. I really appreciate the offer. Call me Mama Cash. I work for myself. Look, motherfucker, you call me Mama Cash. You're in my goddamn house, you call me by my goddamn name. Mama Cash! Mama Cash! Mama Cash! Mama Cash! Everything all right, Mama? Yes, baby. I wanted a cowboy. And so I find him and I bring him here and I show him a world he didn't even know could be real, you know, and he does everything I say. Not because he's scared of me or because I pay him extra, but because he loves me. You know, true love, gratitude and trust. You know, that is power. I want you to love me too. I can show you what Tysons can do for you. I can show you what we can do together. I provide you with equipment and Flaco will give us the bank accounts and you provide me with an operation that make us money faster than you ever thought possible. Look, Flaco ain't going for that, man. Even if I agreed, he's scared. Let Mama take care of Flaco's fears. What do you say? Uh uh uh. Here you are. Good look. - And... - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ah. [CARTER] Well? Well what? You tell me what happened about last night or what? We been putting in work all these years and you ain't never kept me in the dark never. I'm down for whatever. I ain't mad. Jackie worked a nigga pretty good in that hot tub. But we didn't go out there for me to get my rocks off. We partners, right? What's the deal? I don't know. She was talking about Minnesota, Jamaica and Muppets. True love and shit. True love? She was trying to kick it to you? Nah, nigga, not like that, man. She trying to do business, you know, some serious money, but I'm trying to figure out if she's trying to set us up or not. Trust her? That don't matter unless we get Flaco to... [PHONE RINGING] Ant. What up? Word, what happened? Then, I just realized all the benefits. [ANT] Well, that's good to hear, man. I'm happy to hear that. Yeah, that's good. Real good. [CARTER] Who's that?

What I did was, I created a protocol that runs in tandem with our tracing terminal. Now, what that does is, it shaves a ten- thousandth percent off each basis point of every transaction. And it adds an equal amount to every transaction before it's processed. Now that is sent to one of a hundred offshore accounts with routing numbers that cycle every hour. Now the best part about that shit, right here. We move it before the processing bank gets to it. So when the numbers come out on the statements, the shit looks exactly how it's supposed to look.

[ANT] Mama sent us modified credit card terminals to install in businesses under Flaco's accounts. The terminals was hacked. They'd place a trace on each card swiped and the terminals could send us credit card numbers before they went out to the banks. All right, you're all set. Um, think you could hook me up with some of them Dutches? No? We're talking hundreds of businesses with hundreds of transactions a day. The terminals was hacked. They'd place a trace on each card swiped and the terminals could send us credit card numbers before they went out to the banks. We're talking hundreds of businesses with hundreds of transactions a day. Duke's program worked. And it worked fast. Oh shit. Tiny pieces of pennies adding up quicker than any kilos of piff ever could. Hot coffee. And just in case merchants started asking questions, credit card companies started checking in, I had the phone company on payroll. We installed a tap that cross-referenced the businesses and the bank phone numbers to intercept any calls related to the businesses we were skimming from. That's right, I can verify the charges. I can validate the charges. Yes, that's right. I can validate the charges. So if anyone started snooping, they'd reach out and touch Sweets. I can validate the charges. It was genius. Standby, I'll get you the authorization code. Did you tell them about the dojo? Did you tell them about the dojo? - Uh-huh. - Tell them about the dojo. - Tell them. - Yeah. That's free advertising. You didn't tell them? [PETEY] Why didn't you tell them about the goddamn dojo? - [ANT] You drunk. - No, no, no, not drunk. - Yes, you are. - No I'm not. - [ANT] You are drunk. - I feel good though. Yo, Ant. Gotta show you something, my nigga. Oh, hey Cass, how you doing? - I'm good. - Looking lovely as always. - Thank you. - What's up? What you wanna show me? Don't get mad. All right? Show, nigga. Ladies. Okay, what's this? Uh, white bitches. No, snow bunnies. I'm not bitch. What the fuck we supposed to do with them? Make a music video? Ant, listen, we got a lot of credit and we gotta spend it. This is how we do it. I could do it myself, or Cass. Listen, I barely got enough time to spend the ones I got. How's it gonna look if you or I go into a department store, flaunting somebody else's credit card? What they gonna think? What would you think? That you are criminal. Exactly. But if these bit... bunnies walk into a place flaunting somebody else's credit card, what would you think? That they suck a mean dick. They do. I would think y'all cutting my man in on this. Huh? Don't fuck her, Ant. And don't fuck none of these showcase showdown bitches either. I tell you, I'm not bitch. Okay. So what you think? All right, let's do it. To the white bitches.

Try. Mmm, you must not drink last sip. Is real coffee. Strong, no filter. This is like men I want to do business with. Strong. No filter. My apologies. The coffee was good. Look, with all due respect, we didn't come here to drink coffee. No. You come for, for business. You come for my money. Tell me. What you give for my money? We didn't ask for this meeting. You asked to meet us. Ah, this is good. No filter. Irina said we should meet. We met. If you don't want to tell us what we're doing business about, then I'll pay for the coffee and we can go. This is insult. Look, you may be known around here, but we're not from around here. I don't like my time being wasted. You are like angry dog. Maybe stupid, maybe dangerous, maybe useful. Look, I ain't no man's dog. Well, you're my dog. You are a good team. Good friends. I think I trust. Sit, sit, please, please. Irina tells me you make credit appear in other men's names?

Can you make happen? Well, you know, to get that many profiles may take some time and uh, that many cards gotta be spread out over months. I want one week. This nigga bugging. [MAN] I don't care about cards. I want information, I want people. Can you do it? - There ain't nothing I can't do. - Word. Then we have deal. Yo, you snowflake bitch, get the fuck over here.

Now you in a war and it's a war you ain't gonna win. Fuck. Well, it ain't the first time I heard that and I'm still here. Goddamn it. Don't make me choose a losing side. Telling you, this shit gonna get bloody. Really? Come on, man. Yo, get the fuck up. Get the fuck up. Get the fuck out you dumb white bitch. Get the fuck out of here! Ready for this? What you think? Two million. Now I can get you the numbers. It'll take 10 days, but I can get them for you. He said a week. Nigga, two million. Shit. I didn't say yes. You didn't have to. Mirland's not a man you can say no to. Nigga, who you talking to? All I'm saying is you're not from here. This man is crazy. He's the head of the biggest crime syndicate in Dade County. He got eyes everywhere and ears everywhere. And soldiers everywhere. This man is ruthless. Well, uh, I ain't never backed down from a fight. Mm-hmm. I used to do business with a man, a buddy of mine named Dino, who worked for Mirland. He had it in his head that, uh, he could skim a little bit here, fence a little bit there. You know, just a little bit off the top, nothing big. So, this big job we had and he figured, big job, skim a little, nobody will notice. No big deal. Mirland noticed. So one day, I went to meet my connect. He wasn't there. Mirland was. He came himself. He walked in my office with four big boxes and he sat them on my desk and he stared at me until I opened them. [CARTER] What was in them? [DUKE] Dino... his hands, his heart, his lungs and his balls. What I'm saying is, there's no big or small with a man like Mirland. It's just what he wants. And if you say no to him, he's gonna take it as disrespect and he's gonna come hard at you. You go hard at him he's gonna come harder. And again and again and again till he gets what he wants or one of you is dead. [PETEY] Yo, Ant. Yo, there's a big... There's this big nigga, this cowboy nigga, man. I gotta stop smoking that shit. - The nigga in your shit, nigga! - What? Get over there, man, he in your shit, man. Let's go there, nigga! [PETEY] I saw the nigga stole a hamburger out the refrigerator, too. Nigga look like a black Lone Ranger, son. No later than... [PHONE RINGING] ADA. Yo, it's Ant. Good to hear from you, Mr. Mendino. I've been awaiting your call. Excuse me, I've got to take this. Where the fuck have you been? Man, you told me to lay low. [WALLY] Low? Do you realize the chatter coming through my office? Whispers about a New York crew working a fraud ring with the Albanian syndicate? What did I tell you about foreigners, Ant? I told you, you stay away from internationals. What do you know? All I know is they're watching a man named Mirland. Rumors about forging passports all over Eastern Europe. Please tell me you're not involved. Ant, do you realize the world we're living in? Do you have any idea who they could sell those passports to? We're not talking DEA anymore, we're not even talking INS. Homeland Security is watching this guy. Look, get out. Get out, Ant. There's nothing I can do for you, I'm sorry. You can't ever call me again. [GUNSHOTS FIRING] [GUNSHOTS FIRING] Let them through. Let them through, let them through. Mama's hearing bad things. Yo, maybe you listening too hard. Mama got ears everywhere. I hear everything. You sleeping with the enemy. Yeah, well, you'll get your piece. So that don't really concern you. Everything concerns me. You listen to Mama Cash. Mama told you no. I ain't your dog. Don't come to my fucking house and tell me how to do my business... You work for Mama Cash, you do what I say or I'll punish you. - Who the fuck are you talking to? - You! Oh, you think I'm one of your fucking cowboys. Don't talk to me like that. Don't talk to me like that. You fucked up. You fucked up. [MAN] Yee-haw! [DUKE] Yo, it's Duke. They blew the office. They bagged Crisco. No. Ant... Petey's dead. They shot him. Mama or Mirland, I don't know who. Sweets is gone and I'm gone too. I left what you needed in a PO Box. It's in... I'll catch up. Play on, player. [TRAIN HORN BLARING] [MIRLAND] I think maybe you wouldn't come. Maybe only you came for the girl. You have my names? Where's Cass, man? She's close. But I don't lie. I treat her rough. You see? I am a man of my word, even when you try to back down, I still bring you money. I still do business. Forget business, where's Cass? I want to make sure she's safe. [MIRLAND] I never say she would be safe. Give me names. Maybe you don't bring? Nah, we bring. [CARTER] Whoa, whoa. Tell your boys to lower their guns. Okay. Take money and go. Or stay, be shot. No difference. Fuck you. I'm right when I say you are like angry dog. But not useful. Stupid. Okay, you stay... two dead men. You have cowboy? Like, real American western? I watch these movies as child! John Wayne, Billy Kid, the Okeydoke Corral! Is real standoff! I have always dreamed of this. Ant, you make me happy! You will die like heroes! [GUNSHOTS FIRING] Cass! [GUNSHOTS FIRING] Cowboy! Cass! Cowboy? All right, no cow. [GUNSHOTS FIRING] You find her? Nigga, you see her with me? He with us? I ain't trying to find out. [GUNSHOT FIRING] Cass? Cass? Cass. Cass. Where'd he go? Out back. Mama said kill y'all. Nah that wouldn't be right. Where's Cassie? Mama. Mama. It's not the cowboy. A woman. Killed by a woman. Pathetic. There she is, Mama. She's dead. Your baby's dead, Mama. [SCREAMING] Where's Ant? He got away. A real cowboy. [GUNSHOT FIRING] [TRAIN HORN BLARING] What now? [PHONE RINGING] You gonna answer that? [FLACO] Ant, yo, it's Flaco, man. They came to get me. I'm locked up, man. Hey, you... Hey, you gotta come get me up out of here. I can't be here, Ant. Please, man. Yo, Ant. Yo, Ant! [MAMA] I'm coming for you. You hear me, Ant? My baby Cassie is dead and you killed her. I'm coming for you, Ant. You hear me... you can't fucking hide from me. Do you fucking hear me? What now? Can't stay here. Can't go home. Mendocino.
