GENOA, ITALY I spent my childhood here in Genoa. They were hard times. Back then, many Italians... ...went to look for work abroad. Marco... Marco... Marco... You still refuse to see me off with a smile. Every month, many people left Genoa and Naples for South America by immigrant ships. Some people emigrated with their families. Others had to leave them behind. They traveled across the Atlantic Ocean to Brazil, Uruguay, and sometimes as far as Argentina. Marco, so you still refuse to say goodbye with a smile. Every man has trying hardships, throughout his lifetime. By overcoming each hardship one by one... ...you'll grow up to become a respectable gentleman. Goodbye, Marco. No... don't go! Please, I must get through! Please let me through! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Marco... Marco! No! Don't go, Mother! Go back! Don't follow me! Don't leave me, Mother! Marco! Mother! Mother... Mother! Be good, do as your father says! Don't forget to write me! Mother! Mother! ONE YEAR LATER Amadeo! Amadeo! I'm hungry, but we don't have time for a quick lunch. Amadeo, it's been two months, since Mother's last letter. She's written every month, since she arrived in Argentina. She always writes three letters: One to me, Tonio and Father. Welcome home. There's lunch on the table. I've got to go. - Here you are. - Okay, just leave it to me. Here's your parcel. Please sign the receipt. Gather around! Don't miss our exciting show! You'll laugh until you cry! - Here's the receipt. - Thank you, just wait a moment. - Here's your tip. - Thank you. By the way, I got a telegram from the Michelangelo. It will enter Genoa port in two days... ...with you mother's letter. A letter? The day after tomorrow? What can I get you? Tonio, you're back? Jump, jump high. That's it, Amadeo. Father should at least come home early today. I'm sure he's busy. Besides, he didn't expect me home today. - Can you stay for dinner? - No, I'm afraid I can't. I have to start studying for my exams. I see. I have some paperwork at the hospital. Forgive me, Marco. See you. Father is never at home. He doesn't care about me, you or Mother. He has no time for us. All he thinks about is work! He even works on Sundays! I understand how you feel... but it's hard for him too. Come on, let's eat out for lunch. - And then... - I don't want any lunch! Hey, Marco! Where are you going? Marco! You've got such an easy life. Little monkey, do you want to dance too? Have a pair of dancing shoes. They're pretty dancing shoes. When I put them on my feet I can dance and twirl around. I have a pretty brooch. A very pretty dancing brooch. My pretty dancing brooch Will dance and twirl about. Who are you, dear sir? A kind and gentle man. I shall give you flowers, that decorate my hair. That was wonderful. It really looked like it was dancing. Fiorina, you should invite your friend in. But sister... What's your name? I'm Marco Rossi. I'm Concetta. This sulky faced girl is Fiorina. And the little one is Julietta. Monkey! Monkey! Don't, you'll scare the monkey. Monkey... Monkey... - Monkey! - Julietta! Amadeo. Hey, watch this! Let's be friends. Great news! A ship will leave in five days and at half the fare! We'll have enough if we work a little harder. The problem is after we arrive... Oh, we'll be okay once we're there. Off we go to a new land, Argentina! Tell me... Can I really go to Argentina at half the fare? Even half that for children... And who are you? Father! He's fainted! I've told the doctor many times. I'll pay for my daughter's medicine once she gets well. Mr. Rossi, I know she'll get better. Please, she needs medicine. Let me talk to the doctor, please wait. Come in. - Marco, you need to see your father? - Yes. - Are you Mr. Rossi's son? - Yes, I am. I'm so grateful to your father. He's such a good man, you should be very proud. - Give her medicine. - Okay. Marco. I thank you with all my heart. Wait at the pharmacy. Come this way. - What is it, son? - Mr. Peppino has a high fever! - Mr. Peppino? - He needs a doctor now. I know... ...how eager your father is, to save the poor. I also know that... ...the clinic won't run smoothly without him. However, everything has its limit. I just wonder if he should sacrifice his family. - You've got a cold. - A cold? That's all? Don't treat it lightly, you'll only get worse. The worst part is paying the doctor's bill. An entertainer like me can't afford it. I'm becoming feverish! Father! Marco, you are the first audience to see my show. Father has never told me... ...but he thinks I have no talent. All I'm good at is baby-sitting. He's right. I'm not good enough to perform. When Father and Concetta are in trouble, I can't help. Everything I do ends in failure. But that time, I... The puppet looked like it was really dancing. I was so surprised. Thank you, Marco. The Peppino's are leaving, for Argentina in five days. They asked me to go with them. I didn't tell you, but I've been saving money... ...to go and visit Mother in Argentina one day. Father, I really want to go to her. Marco, wait. I can't let you go. I don't know what Mr. Peppino has told you. It's a long hard journey to Argentina... - ...even for adults. - But... I know you're worried, but I'll make the decisions. - It's been three months! - In Buenos Aires, your mother's sponsor Mr. Mequines is there. He would contact us if anything happened. I don't want you to bring this up again. Sorry sir! The ship has arrived and with Mother's letter! Hello! I've come for Mother's letter. Ma'am? Mother, why? What's happened to you? You must be sick. There's no doubt about it. I've got to go to Argentina, to help you, Mother! For some reason, Marco didn't looked for us in a long time. It's hard for him to watch us getting ready to leave. He really wanted to come with us. Too bad... Fiorina! Fiorina! Marco, is your friend on that ship? I see... Everyone is leaving... So this ship will leave for South America in ten days. It will sail to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro. Rio de Janeiro... Marco, a stowaway? From the description, it sounds like Marco. I shouldn't have told him anything. Is this your son? It's Marco. I know the whole story. You have such a brave son. Brings tears to my eyes. What do you say about leaving him to us? But this isn't going to Argentina... Some bulks head on to Buenos Aires. I'll talk to a captain in Rio for a transfer. What do you say? Please, let me go to Argentina. I have to see if Mother is alright. If you take me home... I'll just run away again and again. Marco... Go, I'll be waiting for you. Thank you, Father. RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL What a decrepit old ship. It's from Naples, and it's reach Buenos Aires first. The captain knows about you, so you have nothing to worry about. - Thank you. - Here's some food for you. It's not much, but... What's wrong, Marco? Chef Leonard... I can't thank you enough. Well, now... We pray that you find your mother soon. Take care. Yes, sir! Monkey... Watch this. Ready, Amadeo! He usually falls over. Come on, Amadeo. Where are you from, son? From Genoa. I'm Marco Rossi. I'm Federico from Sicily. And this is Lenarta. - The little one is Nino. - Nice to meet you. I see. Your father has such an important job. He must stay and work in Genoa. Before Mother left... ...I wasn't a very good boy. That's why I must find her... ...and see if she's alright. What a boy! That's what I call a true Italian. Marco of Genoa, you're so courageous. I take my hat off to you. Look out! What's going to happen to us? This ship is going to sink. Control the ship! Captain... The ship is... It is sinking! We're going to drown! Stop it! - Stay calm everybody! - Get back! Federico! Damn, we're finished! The morning of our departure... I love you my darling Bella. Ciao, Bella, Ciao... Be brave! Never lose the Italian pride! Let us sing as one! The morning of our departure... I love you my darling Bella. Ciao Bella, Ciao... I will lead the way to freedom, with my own hand. Lightning may divide the sky... Be brave, just listen to them. ...Against the strong wind. I will find the way to a new morning. BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA Here's 55 pesos and 65 centavos. See, you're rich. It's my return fare. - Don't lost it. - OK! I'd like to exchange 13,7 liras. - It's time to say goodbye. - Thank you for everything. Farewell Federico, farewell Lenarta. - Take care, Marco. - I will. - Goodbye, Nino. - Goodbye, Marco. Amadeo, it's already autumn here, isn't that strange. Sorry, kid. Are you okay? It's my fault, I wasn't looking. No problem, bye. Excuse me... - What? - Can you tell me how to get to Los Artes? To Los Artes? - Can you read? - Yes. Then everything is simple. Go straight down this road. Everything will be written on the corner. - You'll find it without any problems. - Thank you very much! Los Artes, number 170... Amadeo, finally we're in Los Artes! Number 168... Number 172... Everything is right! 174, 176... 178... It's the next one! Mom lives in this house. 180! - Excuse me... - One minute! - How can I help you? - I'm Marco, the son of Anna Rossi. - Marco? - Yes. I came from Genoa. Tell me, does the Mekines family live here? Mekines? They moved out two months ago. - Moved out? Where? - It seems... ...they went to Cordoba. - To Cordoba? - Yes, to Cordoba... to San Martin. - But I'm not sure... - I'll go anyway! Thank you, ma'am. - One ticket to Cordoba. - That's 20 pesos. What's the matter, son? My money, it's gone! I don't have time for games. Next please. I really had money, right in here! Hey, get out of the way! Train to Cordoba now boarding. All aboard! Wait... Wait! Hey, where are you going?! Grab that boy! Hey, stop right there! Wait for me! You'll get hurt! - Gotcha! - Let me go! I must get on that train! Stop that train! Somebody please, stop it! You know, you'll kill yourself doing that. Now, I'll never get to see my mother. I'm so tired, Amadeo... Let me sleep for just a little bit... Ladies and gentlemen. Today, we're going to perform a comic tragedy for you! The leading actress is... Marco. Marco, Marco... Marco... Marco! Friorina? Fiorina, I... I... Marco... I see. So your mother is in Cordoba. That explains why we couldn't find her. I'm so happy to see you! Now, I know I'll find Mother. Without any money? I'll walk then. Impossible! It's over 700km from here. But... If I go to Cordoba, I can be with Mother. So you see, I must go. Father... Father... No, never! I won't travel so far. - Father, I beg you. - I said no! We'd need money to get there. Get ready for tonight's show! I have a pair of dancing shoes They're pretty dancing shoes. When I put them on my feet I can dance and twirl around. I have a pretty brooch A very pretty dancing brooch. My pretty dancing brooch Will dance and twirl about. Who are you, dear sir? A kind and gentle man. I shall give you the flowers that decorate my hair. I have a pretty brooch A very pretty dancing brooch. My pretty dancing brooch Will dance and twirl about. Bravo! Good work. The customers loved you. Here's your share. By the way, do you have friends in Cordoba? I can't say that I don't. Today is the start of our lucky troupe. We'll surely be famous, in the faraway city of Cordoba. Let's get the show on the road! You're in good spirits, Father. My heart is already in Cordoba. Our newest act starting Fiorina and Amadeo... ...is an act you won't want to miss! On to Cordoba, giddy-up! Marco, what are you doing? - Look up. - What's there? I've never seen such a big sky before. It's enormous! Cordoba is an old town, comparable to Rome. I've been dreaming for so long... ...to visit and see this graceful town. It won't be long now, Marco. I can't wait to see her. Do you know why Father decided to take you? It's not only for your sake. What do you mean? Our mother left us... ...right after Julietta was born. She didn't even say goodbye to us. She just left. It's getting cold. She didn't like us or the puppet show. That's why Father didn't stop her. - I was being selfish. - No, you weren't. I feel sorry for Julietta, but I didn't need a mother. But we know... ...how much you miss your mother. Father knows how you feel more than any of us. So don't think we're doing you a favor by going to Cordoba. Do you understand? Let's go! Father, wake up! Concetta is sick, wake up! Hurry, Father! Concetta... It looks like the painkiller is taking effect. Thank you, thank you for your help. She's okay for now. But you should take her to hospital. To hospital? Is it that bad? But we have to get to Cordoba. She's in no condition to be moved. I must at least get him to Rosario. To Rosario? Please understand, Fiorina, that it's best for Marco. Colonel Barientos? He retired and now he's a prominent citizen in Rosario. I was told to contact him in emergencies. In emergencies... Sister Margarita is going to Rosario tomorrow morning. Go with her. The Colonel will help you in Rosario. Please let me stay until Concetta is well. No! Don't forget why you came all the way here. To find my mother... Then you must go to Rosario. If we could, we'd go with you. Promise to introduce me to your mother one day in Genoa. I must stay here... ...so I won't see you off. Goodbye, Marco. I know you will find your mother. Dear Fiorina, I'm leaving you Mother's picture. That way I know we will meet again someday. Till we meet again. Marco! Marco! Marco! ROSARIO This is a formal letter of referral. - Tell me... - The Colonel's not home. - He left for Buenos Aires yesterday. - Buenos Aires? He's not here so leave. The Colonel is supposed help me get to Cordoba. No one has informed me. I know what you really came for... ...a job and a place to live. Am I right? That's not true! My mother is in Cordoba! - Your mother? - Yes. I have come from Italy to find her. But I have little money and no friends to rely on. You wouldn't believe how many Italians come here for help. No friends, no money, letters of referral! I know you may not believe me. But, it's not what you think. Just admit that you came here for money. You can't expect me to believe such a pitiful lie. A lie? That's right. Who would believe you came all this way alone? You're only here for money, a beggar! A beggar? I'm not lying. Open your eyes! You're not hurt, kid? THE STAR OF ITALY Marco! It's really you Marco! It's me, Federico. We were on the same boat together. Federico? Yes, now tell me what's happened to you. Federico! Attention, gentleman of Italy! This boy has come from Genoa all by himself. This poor child was scolded by a stranger. He was accused of lying for money. He was cast out like a stray dog! - That's awful. - Poor boy... But this is not true! He's not in Rosario for the money! Please tell them why he's here. The boy's name is Marco. He has come to find his mother all alone. The letters his mother wrote every month suddenly stopped coming. She wasn't at the address she gave him... ...his money was stolen. But that didn't stop him from looking for her. Finally he found out his mother was in Cordoba. He arrived in Rosario after many hardships. Even with a formal letter of referral he still got turned out from the goal. What a dreadful story! He is a good boy who loves his mother dearly. I would do anything to unite him with his mother. Federico! I'm asking for your help. I see at least twenty Italians here. If you donate 2 pesos each... ...he'll have the train fare to Cordoba. There's nothing else for me to say. Let's help the poor boy. Or are you going to abandon him like a stray dog? - Never! - Let me help! Me, too! C'mon everybody, empty your pockets! Use the hat! Put your money here. Give me the hat. - Pass it over here, too! - Wait, it's my turn. Here you go... Let us make up for the rudeness of our people. Find your mother and be happy. How can I... ...ever thank all for you? Thank you very much! The favor you received here today... should be returned to someone else some day. When the times comes, just do your best. Gentlemen! Next stop... Cordoba! You'll finally see your mother tomorrow. I'm so happy for you. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you... At last, I will see Mother. CORDOBA Hello! Is this the Mequines residence? Anybody home? Amadeo, Mother lives in this house. Hello! Is anyone there! Mr. Mequines! Mr. Mequines! Excuse me, dear... - Are you here to see the Mequines? - Yes. They don't live there anymore. They moved to Tucuman about a month ago. To Tucuman? They weren't here very long. Tucuman... is it far from here? It's about 600 km north. That far? Are you cold? Let's find a place to sleep. We'll head to Tucuman in the morning. Let me go! I said, let me go! Are you okay? Hey you, are you with this guy? You filthy kid! Neither of you belong here, go home! Wait! You have no reason to be so rude to me. Yeah, behave like a respectable adult! What'd you say?! Little brats! Don't think I'll forget this! I'm Pablo. I'm Marco and this is Amadeo. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. Come to my house and I'll treat you to dinner. I can't. What's stopping you? Do you have a place to stay tonight? Not really. Then you'll stay at my place. Thank you, Pablo! Welcome home, brother. Dinner is ready. Juana, you should be in bed. I felt much better today. Who's that? My friend, Marco. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Hello. - A monkey! - That's Amadeo. Nice to meet you, Amadeo. - I'll get another plate. - I'll do it! You get back into bed. Come here, Amadeo. She looks so happy. We don't have many visitors. I'm glad you came. - Marco, may I sleep with Amadeo? - Of course! - I'm sure he'd love to. - Terrific! Thank you, Marco. You know, Marco, you're a great kid. Pablo... Let's clear the table. Juana, you'll be okay. - What's the matter? - She has a fever. She shouldn't have stayed up. - It looks serious! - Juana, be strong. - We should call a doctor. - Doctor? No doctor will come here. But she's burning up. - Pablo! - We went to hospital! But they refuse to help us... ...once they find out where we live. They treat us worse than animals. Marco! Where are you going? Hang in there, Juana. Hang in there. Hello! I know it's late but there's an emergency! A little girl is sick with fever. - Where do you live? - In San Pedro. - San Pedro? - Yes. The doctor's out now, we can't help you. Please, I beg you! Please! Open the door! Get out! Otherwise, I'll call the police! A girl is sick! Please, I need your help! Who is it? - Where is the patient? - In San Pedro. San Pedro... I have money. There's a little girl with a very high fever. Have you got 20 pesos? Night calls are expensive. If I use this money, I can't get to Tucuman. - What's wrong? - Ah, nothing. Please ask the doctor to make a house call. - How is she? - This will bring down her fever. If she rests, she'll get well. Thank you, doctor. You're going to be okay. I'm so relieved you're okay. I'm so happy, Amadeo, she's going to get better. But... Mother... We'll be together soon. This is the only way you can get to Tucuman. Don't worry, I've done it before. Hurry, get in! - We made it. - Not just yet. Whatever happens, don't move or make a sound. Promise me. I promise. Here, take this. Marco, I thank you from my heart. You saved my sister's life. I would do anything for you. Never forget that. Hopefully, this will keep you warm. Thank you, Pablo. Don't let Amadeo go. Bastard, wait! Get that kid! A train jumper! You're trapped. Let go of me! Shut up! I'll teach you a lesson. Take that! Don't forget, you gave me your word! You promised! Stop jabbering! Pablo! Marco... Pablo... Stay put! Please forgive me, Pablo. There's a monkey! Where are you, Amadeo? Amadeo! Get out! I know you're there! Come out now before I hurt your monkey! - Search the next car. - Wait! Please let him go. This track will take us to Tucuman, Amadeo. Hey, wait! Please, take me to Tucuman! Please, wait! I beg you, wait! Wait... Wait! Amadeo, are you cold? Just a little further... ...and we'll soon be with Mother. Mother... Look Amadeo, it's Mother. She's right there... Mother... Mother... Where are you going? Mother, don't leave me! I'm sorry, Mother. I can't go any further. I can't take another step. Mother... Mother... Thank you for saving my life. TUCUMAN We made it. I'll finally be with Mother! Is anybody home? - What can I do for you? - I'm Marco Rossi from Genoa. - Marco Rossi? - Yes, but... Mr. Mequines, please come quick! - Are you Marco Rossi? - Yes. How did you get here? Didn't you get my letter? Marco! God has guided you here. Marco... Please listen to me carefully. Mother! Mother... Mother! Mother! What's wrong? Mother! Mother! Come here, son. Leave me alone! Mother! Open your eyes and look at me. Don't you know who I am? It's me, Marco! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mr. Mequines, what's wrong with my mother? Mr. Mequines! Mr. Mequines... Marco... - Mr. Mequines! - Marco! Mr. Mequines, please, do something to help her! I beg you! My mother will die! Please save my mother. Save her! Marco! Please, you must do something. Please help her! Marco! Mother... I'm right here beside you. I'll never leave you. So, please... Get well soon. Don't die... Don't leave me alone. Don't die, please! Don't leave me! Marco. Marco. Marco... It's really you. Mother. Marco. Mother... Mother... Mother! Marco...! My darling, Marco! Mother... Mother... Come home to Genoa with me. Father and Tonio are waiting. They're waiting for us. Mother... Mother... Doctor, thank you. I'll never forget what you've done. Save your gratitude for someone who needs it. - I hear you're interested in medicine. - Yes. - And your father works in a clinic. - Yes. I want to become a doctor. I want to help people in need... ...like my father. When your dreams comes true, come back here. We look forward to the day that we meet again.
