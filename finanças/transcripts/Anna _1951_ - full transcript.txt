- Good morning. - Good morning. Mama! Mama! - What's the matter? Why are you crying? - Mama! Mama! - Sister, take him with you - As if I had nothing else to do! - Sister Luigina will take you to your mother. - Mama! Mama! Sister Anna! - Come to my office tonight. I need to talk to you. - Yes, Mother. - Good morning, professor. - Good morning. OK, look. This is a case of a fracture of the meniscus. Will I be able to play again, professor? - Which team do you play for? - With the team from Monza. - Are you any good? Very good! Even La Gazzetta dello Sport" wrote about him! - Won't I play again? - I'll tell you after the operation. Now, rest. - Two way X-rays. - Alright. I've followed this case. His course is normal. He can return to a normal diet. No, doctor, excuse me. He can't eat. He couldn't keeping anything down. Very well, then you see what's wrong with him, please. - Have they made his X-rays? - Yes, they're on your table. - Are you sure? - Yes, professor. Too bad. I'd love you making a mistake once in a while, Sister Anna... Let's go! And don't take it the wrong way. You always like to joke, professor! Ah, it's scarring over! How are you doing today? Don't you know that a doctor's best helper is the patient? Or don't you want to get better? Maybe you don't care. Very well, continue the treatment: liver extract and vitamins. - Let's see... How are you? - Very bad. - What do you feel? Huner! Look! I always get the smallest one! The nuns hate me, they don't want to feed me! I'll take care of it. Strict diet! Get lost! You heard the professor. You have to help us cure you. She didn't wait for me to get sick, to free herself from me. She hasn't sent one letter, not one phone call, nothing! She'll come today, it's visiting day. Don't let her see you like this. I'll send the barber. Sister Anna... You'll fast today. And no smoking... it's better. - Will you operate, professor? - Yes, in the morning. Are you scared? - No. - Good morning, professor! - Good bye, boys. Good morning. He's fine. He's just playing up to avoid going back to prison. - I'll keep him here for another week at least. - Thank you, professor! Sister, could I get a book? But not the Holy Scriptures? Yes... It wouldn't harm you reading it! Let's discharge nr 5... Professor Ferri is expected in the operating room. Go check on our two tourists and then join me. You check on room 2, you come with me. - Good day, colonel. - Hi, dear. You're not giving me a shot, are you? - Stay calm, it's for this lady. Did they bring your orange juice? - Late! Look at that defence! Try to take one, if you can! What, what? Professor, I feel so ill! - And the professor? - He has an emergency. And that young, nice doctor... where's he? Hurry up! Hurry up, I'm so nervous! And don't you hurt me! - Don't make me waste time. - It's hurting me already... You detest me, don't you? I know you detest me and I feel so lonely... - So lonely! I don't know when I'll get out of here! - Soon. Another hemostatic pincers. Courage, we'll do it quickly and you won't feel anything. Afterwards... what will become of my child? You can worry about him after the operation. Take it easy. Pulse: 120 Heartrate: 90. I've put her on an IV, but... Yes, I know. It's like she's already dead. They always come too late... However, so long as there's a chance in a thousand, we have to try. - Everything's ready, professor. - Thank you, Sister Anna. The ether. My child! My child, sister! Don't worry about him now. Breathe deeply. You may start, doctor. Needles! Scissors. Sweat. The three! Tampons! Camphor. - Professor... - Intercardiac! Your coffee, professor. My collegues are right: operate only when success is certain! But, with all my twenty years of experience... ...it's an opinion I never could make myself accept. We knew you were trying the impossible. Professor, number 36 is ready for the operation. Penicilin, penicilin! They all want penicilin now.. - And then they die anyway! The voucher? - Here it is. You needed it, didn't you? Don't you tell no one! Where's your daddy? You won't say? I don't give a damn about your professor! I'm her husband! I want to know who has authorized you to take away my wife? As if nothing mattered! - Don't shout or I'll kick you out! - Ah, here you are. Let's go! - You know what they did to your mother? - Not in front of the child! I because I know what I'm saying. They've taken her without my approval and you've killed her! - Yes, they've killed her! Killed her! - Shame on you! - Where were you when they brought your wife? - I... was walking around... I'm always walking around... looking for work... You're drunk! Leave! And the child? We'll take care of him. Come back when you've found work. And don't come back in this condition! She was my wife? May I see her? Take him to her. - And the child? - Admit him him in pediatrics. I'll speak to the professor. With the advances in modern medicine, they'll find something wrong with him! We're all sick with something! - Where are you taking him? - To Pediatrics. - Why? - Sister Anna told me to. - Sister Anna? We have to watch over him for a few days, Mother. It's necessary. Fine. Take him. Why do you lie to me, Sister? The child is not sick. I couldn't leave him with his father... he wasn't in any condition to... Remember this is a hospital, not a guesthouse. You may go. - Oh! Dear Anna! - Good day! - Luisa! This is Giorgio. Isn't she beautiful? He really wanted to meet you. Did I pick right? Isn't he nice? - Yes, very. When are you getting married? - Tomorrow, Anna, I've written you.. - We want so much that you come. - I would too, but I'm afraid I won't make it. At least at the church. Then we'll bring you back here. Thank you, but I really can't. - I've told, Giorgio? She's to get out of here! - Afraid? What of? I'm here to defend her! Don't you ever wish to go out and see the world, see the people? There are plenty of people here, and this is my world. You see; it's pointless to insist. She's happy here. Yes, I'm happy. At least accept some candies! How stupid of me, I almost forgot!. Excuse us, darling, I've got something to say to my sister. Anna, I'm moving out of the house where we two lived together. As I was emptying some boxes I found these. I don't know if I did well bringing them. - You've done well. - Let's go! You must have a lot to do. Thanks for coming, Luisa. And thanks to you too, Giorgio. I wish you the best, with all my heart. I'll pray for you tomorrow. - Farewell, Anna. - Good bye, Sister Anna. Come in. - Praised be Jesus Christ. - May he always be praised. Well, what is it, Sister Anna? Pardon me, Mother, for interrupting your work but I need to speak with you. Fine. I'm listening. I need you, Madre. You must help me! Help you? And how? I asked you some time ago to send me to the convent. I want to take my vows. I was expecting you tonight, sister, and I don't know what drove you to come now. But since you're here, I'll be frank. I don't think you're quite ready to take your vows. Look, the decision you want to make is serious! Really serious... and it's not something that you could nor should do... on a whim. I know. You doubt my calling. Not without reason, sister. In everything you do I find... that there's too much leeway. Your quick desicions, your lack of reflection scare me. - You are too sympathetic.. - Mother, I thought that... It doesn't matter what you think! What matters is what I see, who have more years of experience than you. I don't need to remind you the odd circumstances that brought you here. I see beyond that which you can imagine: you're an excellent nurse. Your zeal and your proven ability have made indispensible here. It's possible that at this time, sister, you're about to pass the deciding test Only staying here within these walls and fighting against yourself... .. you'll be able to say tomorrow that you have won. Yes, Mother... Go now. Pray the Lord and humbly go back to work. - Can you find your way? - Yes. - Nearby there's a bar, but don't go there tonight. - No, I'm going home. - Good bye. - Good bye. Can you give me a light, doctor? Quiet night... You're lucky for your first night duty. - I hope nothing happens. It's just me. - Only you? Landi went home, wasn't feeling to well. Oh, poor guy. Nothing will happen I'm sorry to hear that. - Let's hope so. If anything happens, call me. - OK, doctor. You need to sleep, Corrado, ok! - I want to go home! - Yes, yes, yes... All right, stay put. Sleep, my dear. I want to go home! Relax. You only need to sleep. Finally! Do you realize I've been waiting 32 minutes for you? - Whose turn is it? - It's your turn, honey! Oh, look! One, two, and three! - I'm really tired. - Excuses! Come on, come on! By the way! There's a runour that the lady next door is the widow of a fascist! What do you think of that? I'm quite interested in the subject. - Why even you are...? - I? I've been anti-fascist since '21. Move, move! Hey! Where are you going? - There are two ambulances. - Forget it! Sister Angela is on duty. - I'm sorry colonel. - For God's sake! You can never end a game! Doctor! Doctor! Quickly! Medication! I was on Lambrate highway. I was on my lane. I see the Aurelia coming with more than 100! He's mad! - It's not my fault! - Yes, alright. Write the report. Serious state of shock. His pupis aren't reacting. We'll have to operate. Prepare him. - Good thing you're here. - Serious? - Yes, Manzi doesn't have much experience. Camphor and caffeine and do a blood test! Sister, some alcohol, please. - What's the matter? Are you sick? - No, no. - Go sleep, you're tired. Let me help you a little. And there's no way to call him? Where did he go? Where? - I've understood. Thank you anyway. - Is it serious, doctor? How could I say it without even a X-ray? Of course it's serious. - Did you talk to the professor? - I just called him, but he's at the theatre. - So, you're going to operate? - Naturally. Who else could? We'll operate in 20 minutes. Prepare him for surgery. Hurry, I beg you! Hurry! Wait for me here. - Where are you going, sister? - I need to find Professor Ferri. - Please. Please, enter. Ma'am, it's your husband's assistant. - Professor Ferri? - He should be in balcony number 5. Would you like to sit? I'm sorry... Is it someone you know, sister Anna? - Does Mother Superior know you went out? - No. - You should have told her. - Yes, I should have. Give me another glove! - Come on, stay calm. - Good evening, professor. - Good evening. How is it that you're here? Were you called? Called? No, no. I had to come see one of my patients. Why? Some complication? A serious case, professor, a car accident. I'm doing an exploratory laparotomy. Good, peanuts! You open it and you see. Professor, wouldn't you like examining him? - I will if you wish. - Thank you, professor. A gown! You know, on my first night of duty I was presented with a similar case. And I was a few years younger than you. Gloves... In those times, we didn't take so many precautions. Surgery was still considered a noble art. Sister Anna. You're very tired. We won't need you. Is he out? I too was very nervous that night. My hands were shaking when... Have you seen his tan? These got dough, cars... If everyone walked like me, there'd be fewer accidents! Why are you leaving? Thank the audience! Vittorio, who's the favourite? - The favorite? I'll tell you tomorrow. - Two champagne coctails for number 7. Remember we're here to serve the clients. Andthis is a nightclub, not the opera house. There's a client who's invited you to his table. My contract only says I've got to sing three songs each night... ...not to sit at the tables of your clients. What's your problem? Isn't 15,000 lire a night enough? I don't know what's in your head! I didn't order anything. I don't want it. Sorry. - I slept all day. - You slept? - Hi, beautiful! When? - Never! - Hi! How are you? - Why haven't you gone in? I was looking for you inside... - Sorry, I was late. - Again? In fact,the truth is I don't like to be with those people... that have a right to look at you just because they've paid. Please, go ahead. You too were one of those people... You're right. But it was different then, I only saw you as another beautiful girl. - I've come with this custom-made. Do you like it? - No! I'm sorry, but tonight you'll have to settle with it. - Where would you like to go? - Wherever. - Let's go. - This afternoon seemed it'd never end, because I was dying to see you! - Really? Yes, I was looking at my watch every 15 minutes and it was always too early. So I thought of something to pass the time: ...I went to buy some replacement parts for my tractor. Then I realized I couldn't use them It's so quiet! As if we were far from the city. Why don't you come to my place on Sunday? I'll present you to my mother, you'll see our house, the country... I was born there and I think it's the most beautiful place on Earth! Do you like the countryside? Yes, I like it, but I never go. I don't even remember what it's like. And though one can breathe clean air, there are ants, spiders, flies, mosquitoes. Yech, no! Anna, why do you accept to go out with me? - And you, why do you come looking for me every evening?- You know? - No... It's now been two years that I've worked in nightclubs... and when a man comes looking for me, I know what he wants. But you, I still don't understand you. I'm not courting you! I'm asking you to marry me. It's not possible. Andrea, sometimes I think I've ruined my life! - Why do you say that? - Don't ask any more questions, please. - Leave me, I want to go away. - What's the matter? - I want to go home, now. Can't you tell me what's the matter? I want to be left alone! My destiny is not that of a wife. It's useless meeting your mother and playing the fiancee part. If that's how it is, this will be the last time we see each other. - Where do you want me to take you? Home? - Yes. Forgive me, Andrea. Your words have made me very happy, I had to react. I'm not used with such things. Will you forgive me? I don't understand you. You can't. Please, ask no more. No, Anna. But you'll tell me one day. You know you took a big risk? I was to the point of stopping the car and slapping you. - Could you have done that? - Yes. - Will you go on Sunday? - And you, will you come pick me up some night? - Yes. - OK. Then I'll come on Sunday. - Good night, Andrea. - Good night, Anna. - You've come back... - Yes. Answer it! It's the third time he's called tonight. And I have to get up early tomorrow! I want to sleep! - You're falling for that peasant? - Maybe. I suppose he's asked you to marry him. Yes. Then we're through? - And what are these plants? - Potatoes. Anna, look! Take it, it brings luck. - Here it is... - Thank you. - Good afternoon, mother. - Good afternoon, my dear. Mother, this is Anna. - Delighted. And... she's her sister. What's her name? - Luisa. - What? - Luisa. - Ah, Luisa. Very good. Let's not dawdle. I don't want to be late for Mass. Tell your sister to hurry up. They don't come at the Mass? - I think they do. - Oh, fine, let's go. Your arm, dear. - Hi, Andrea. - Hi, Lucia. - Make acquintance. Lucia and Sergio. Delighted, Luisa. Anna, will you marry me? I always played there when little. I was a bandit and that was my shelter.. - I shouldn't have come. - It never let anyone in. - Don't you like my house? - I like it too much. I thought it'd be a nice one-day holiday. Now it's much more. I might have to pay for it. - What's changed since the other night? - Nothing, nothing has changed. That's why. - Anna, why don't you trust me? - I do! - No. Trying to find out something about you, I had to do it all on my own. - What do you mean? - There's another man involved, right? - Who told you that? - Nobody. It's not hard to guess. Yes, it's not difficult, and not even interesant. I'm a girl who isn't worth anything! Haven't you understood this? Anna, I love you. That's why I need to know. Do you love him? What do you care? There is another man. Isn't it enough for you? I want to know if you love him. Answer me! I hate him... since I've met you. But if I see him, or hear his voice, something awakens in me. Something I can't control. If you knew how many times I've tried to leave him... but it's useless! Andrea! I'm ashamed of myself! It's as if there were two people inside of me: one, the one you love... and the other... I can't say it. Now you know the truth. Take me away without anyone seeing me. Don't move. Smile... - Done. - Don't make these faces, we're going away! I want to help you, Anna. I feel I can trust you. We surrender to so many temptations in life. The important thing is to leave them behind! You can do it! - I love you, Anna! - You help me, Andrea! Hold me like this forever. Don't let me go away you! I love you too, with all my heart. You must believe me! I believe you. They're waiting for us. Come on. This is your home. Thank God, that one's gone. We're done for the night. - How did it go? - A bit more and I'd have been asleep not the patient! If he goes through the night, he's out of the woods. Professor, I don't want you to think I wasn't sure of myself - It didn't even cross my mind. - You know, first time emotions... Of course! I've done all I could, sister Anna. Now... pray God... if you feel you can. - Good night. - Thank you. However, dear collegue, if you have some free time, check the surhery issues. You can alwats find something to learn! - Of course, professor. - Good night. - Good night. - In one hour, if he's restless, give him an injection. - Yes. For fear of forgetfullness you can wipe me from your heart. All the love I had for you, do not forget, and how to love you I knew so! Do not forget! From all this romance a memory is yours just to have. Do not throw it from your heart! If destiny's wing apart us drew, and if afar it made us go,... no fault have I, no, and close to you I'll always feel! Do not forget how much I loved you! Maybe in this heart of mine so much love you could still find! I'll be ready in a moment, wait for me here. - Are we level, or I owe you something? - I'll tell you immediately. - Peanuts. - Ah! Here. - Take it. - I'll give you immeditaely the change. Tell me, that girl... - Who? - Anna. - Anna? - Eh! Is it posible I can't even dance with her? She's difficult to please. Oh, good evening! - Good evening. - What will you have? - I don't know... a cognac. No, no, please allow me. I have something better for you. Here it is. Try this. You'll feel another man after it. Another man? No, thank you. I'll settle for the one I am. - Do you want a drink, Anna? - The lady drinks this. A Manhattan. - Shall we dance? - With pleasure. - It seems this one pleases her? - Hm? Think so? - Aren't you giving me the change. - Want to play it? Paradis perdu. - Good night, Anna. - Good night. - See you tomorrow. - Hello, Anna! - Still up? - Yeah... - Who was it, Andrea? - Yes. I'm so pleased you get along with Andrea. You love him a lot, isn't it? Yes. Ten more days... and everything changes. The manager want to double my pay if I stay on with the club. My pay! If you only knew the plans I and Andrea have! Oh, Anna! I'm happy! - And... have you told Vittorio you're getting maried? - No. - And you don't intend to? - Why? Do you think I'm afraid? I've decided not to see him anymore. Good night, Anna. Good night. - What happened? How come you're here? - Nothing, I was tired of the city. I've dissolved the contract and have run away. Come, let's go. Andrea, you have once told me that if I'd want to comne to your home... What is it, Anna? Nothing. Maybe I've been too rash. I acted without thinking too well. - Tell me the truth. - Andrea, I shouldn't have come to you! But you are... the last haven I'm left with! You must help me! Who's here? Oh, hi, Anna! I'm glad to see you again. This time we won't let you leave anymore. Isn't it true, Andrea? - What's the matter? Why are you crying? - No... nothing. Mother, look who has come! Anna! I'm happy to see you again! Mama, Anna is going to stay with us. We've decided to get married as soon as possible. Leave the luggage here. Take down the dust-jacket from the mirror and prepare the mattresses. - I'd like the collar a little higher. - And the dress should fall better. - And here also... it's a little tight. - How does it look in the back, Luisa? - Never seen a more beautiful dress! - Me neither. - It's perfect, miss. Then it'll only need those two. adjustments - Who is it? - It's I! - You can't see me! - No! - It's bad luck. - I'll come back later. - Yes, Andrea! - Are we finished for this evening? - Yes. - Luisa, does it look OK when I walk? - Yes, it looks marvellous! There's just a little more to fix, miss. We'll be done in an hour! - Is there a sewing machine? I could do it here. - There is one at the villa. Well, then, miss, you'll see everything will be just fine - Lucia, will you accompany her to the villa? - I'll also go. - And tell Andrea I'll be right down. Alright, Anna. - Luisa! - Here I am! - What are you doing here? - I came to see you. And breathe a little clean air... - You should go immediately, Vittorio! Please! - No way! - I see you're doing quite well! - Leave! They can't see you here! Come, quickly! Let's go away! You could have at least told me, before you left. I appologize, Vittorio. But now, let me be. Don't hurt me more. I love Andrea, truly. Are you sure about that? Yes, Vittorio. Tomorrow I'm getting married. If that's so, I promise not to bother you again. - What do you want? - The keys. You never gave them back. - I don't remember where they are. - I saw where you threw them! - You didn't want to to be tempted to come back, eh? - Try to understand me! I could no longer go on with you. All you've done is hurt me! - Now I know I couldn't live with someone like you. - And if he'd know about us? - He knows everything. - Perhaps not everything! - Leave me! - You wouldn't want me to believe you love him? - Yes, I love him. - Say it again! - I love him! - Say it! - I love him as much as I hate you! Go! No... Even after you'll come for me! You'll come looking for me! You don't mean anything for me! - Get out! - You come with me! - No! No! You've turned me into an assassin! I don't want to see you anymore! Go away! Go away! It's pointless, Luisa. I've decided. I want to see you both get married as soon as possible. It's too late. I don't know how to explain it. I've found something here that I didn't know it existed. Something that I've longed for, perhaps without even realizing. I won't ever leave here. Good-bye, Luisa. - Try and explain him... Let me be... - Anna, listen to me... - You shouldn't tire her. She needs to rest. I don't understand. She has changed so much in these last days. Your sister has found herself in a serious crisis, more moral than physical! - Now she thinhs she can be happy. - Do you know where true happiness is? If Anna has decided to remain here... .. it would be a mistake trying to forbbid it to her. This the moment to chose between two roads: the World and God. You are free. In nomine Patris... It's me, Andrea! It's Anna! Look at me! No... you're not Anna... Look at me. Yes, I'm Anna. We've suffered so much,... .. but now it's over, isn't it? Yes... It's over. Et ne nos inducas in temptationem; sed libera nos a malo. Libera nos a malo! Libera nos a malo! Amen. You can leave assured, he's out of danger now. - Thank you, professor. - We don't know how to thank you. - Alright, alright... - If his temperature rises, give him another injection. - Yes. But.. 'let him be for a time. He needs rest more than anything. - Alright. Good bye. - Good bye. - Good bye, professor. Oh... Sister Anna! Were you waiting for me? Yes, professor. It has to do with the wounded, the one under arrest. Tomorrow he'll be released and that means prison for him. Yes, I understand. Well, we'll see. But... You look like you haven't slept all night. - No, professor. - Why not? There's no reason to worry anymore. He's out of danger and in a big way thanks to you... I wanted to ask you how did you like the show. Please... You have to help me, professor! I can't stay in this section. I understand. It's difficult. It's impossible. And I don't have the courage to ask the Mother Superior. I'd have to explain a lot of things. Have me transferred, for whatever reason. If a lie would be enough, I wouldn't hesitate, but it would be of no use! Your presence here is necessary, indispensable... And then... .. I like having you here, feel you working beside me You're a great help. Attentive, efficient, and... at the same time... ...so impulsive, generous... maybe too much. Don't speaklike this, professor. True. You're right. But since you came asking for something that has nothing to do with work.. ...I'm allowed to state my opinion. You should fight, otherwise you'll never now your true self.. Stay here, Sister Anna, believe. My words are a bit egotistical, but we all need you here. Thank you, professor. - Thank you, dear. - Oh, excuse me! If I may... Colonel Rudolf Zenner. - You're in the next room, no? - I was very curious to meet you. And I know your voice, mostly from all the screams when you get injections! Ah, yes! I'd rather get shot! - You, however, scream with satisfaction! You're too kind, colonel! But I would have preferred that you had met me in a few days... ...perhaps I could have avoided such a serious deception. Deception? Don't force me to flatter you! And I'm embarrased to present myself with this fascist look! Let's get over it. - It's spring. How about a stroll in the sun? - Yes, with pleasure. - Like this. We should always trust the spring! Do you feel it? - Very much so! - Eh! Nature! Look and see how the ancient trees fill with new sap! The rain, the flowers, the birds! You're more than a colonel, you're a poet! Excuse me, sister, is there a nun here named Anna? Yes, Sister Anna, but she's not a nun yet. Doesn't she serve in this section? Yes, but since a week ago she's in the surgery. - Since a week ago? - Yes. - Why is that? Why? Because she is and that's enough. And now, sit back. And be good, or you'll get a fever again. How do you know Sister Anna? - How are you darling? - Well. Alright... See I've come to take you? You know, I've found work.. Now you'll go back to nursery school and see all of your friends! Happy? Will you come to see me sometime? Here, Corrado. I put in a little bit of everything, but don't tell anyone! Take it, take it, and when they run out, come back for more. Alright, dear? Thank you, sister Anna. And say there're no miracles! Yesterday they removed the stitches and today he's up and about! Andrea! What are you doing here? Go back to your room! I've come to talk to you, Anna. Go back to your room, or I'll call the orderlies. - I won't go until I've talked to you. - I won't listen to you. But I love you, Anna,you have to hear me. I've suffered for so long time.! I too have suffered, but now you must leave me be. Don't torment me anymore! I've kept loving you day after day... Do you know what I mean? Why have you hidden yourself here, Anna? You told me once that I should learn how to die. I did it, Andrea. Now I'm living a new life. Go away! But I know you loved me! We were to get married, Anna! - Go, go! - Ah, there you are! Your room is ready. Thank you. You can't tell me this, Anna, I know you still love me:... .. I know what you've done the night they've brought me here, wounded. I'd have done it for anyone, Andrea. Don't lie, Anna. You love me! Yes, I love you like I love everyone who suffers with pain. Like everyone who suffers here. I know them all. If you knew how many faces I caressed and how many souls I had to console! Yes, I understand. But you've put on that habit to defend yourself... ...because you're afraid to live. You shouldn't be afraid, Anna. You're a woman and you should be a wife to truly be one. Come with me! - Go! Go away! - You haven't yet taken your vows. You are free! We can start a whole new life.! No, Andrea. I've become a very good nurse. The doctors, the patients, the nuns, they need me. You don't understand what it is to know where one is needed. Anna, don't kid yourself with your generous impulses. Nobody's asking you to make that sacrifice! You owe it to no one! A hospital cannot be your life. - You should have a home and children to love! - Go away! - Look at me! I'll soon be leaving the hospital. Join me. I'll wait for you. Leave me alone! - You have to promise me! - Yes, yes, but go now, go now! Oh my God! Oh my God! What are you doing here? Don't you know you shouldn't be up? Back to bed! Look, patients roaming about like lost souls!:... .. It's against the rules! You come back with the voucher! But, Colonel do you think it fair to... - I won't share your opinion. - Why? How come? Number 56 has already left? - Yes, he sent down 10 minutes ago. - That's a good one! Don't be unjust with me, nor with yourself. I'll wait for you tonight at 9, in front of the hospital. I love you - Easy, eh... - Thank you sister. Oh, the book, sister. I'm only halfway through it... I want to know how it ends. - Keep it. - Thank you. - What happened? - A train accident. A lot of serious injuries. Call sister Anna. Have them prepare the surgery and call Sister Anna. - Where is Sister Anna? - I haven't seen her, professor. I'm here, professor. - Alert all sections. - Have another surgery room ready. Sister Carmela, wake up Dr. Colombo and call the other surgeons - Call all the doctors on duty. - Yes. Get ready for the first surgery. Another long night for us, Sister Anna. But, what do you expect? That's our life. The older I get, the more I know it. The day they'll force me to retire for good... .. and leave my job, I don't think I'll resist. Do you know which people interest me most? The ones I truly love? The strangers who show up here, needing our help... ...and in the end they go without knowing us, without even a thank you. What's the matter, Sister Anna? Ah, I understand. Courage! In life one also has to learn to lose. I haven't lost, professor. I haven't lost!
