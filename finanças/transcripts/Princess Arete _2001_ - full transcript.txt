A princess has shut herself up in the highest tower of that castle... as she waits for a man fit to be her husband to come. She hides away from the world's impurities... in a state of real nobility. So say the people of the town below. PRINCESS ARETE It may be different from a real witch's... but people's hands also have something resembling magic. Is it true... of my hands as well? Are you saying you have some knowledge of needlework...? Really? You want some money? Then go home and darn your underwear or something! Employing a girl's not even allowed by the guild! Huh!! She's a new girl, isn't she? I wonder where she lives? She's not that great. Just right for you! Ouch! Show it to me... your work! Hmm... You've done it. Now I'll teach you the next process. What do you want? I've come to serve dinner. Today all your suitors are returning with their treasure... from the difficult quests demanded by the King. That must be the people welcoming those wonderful men back. It's real magic indeed! What a demand, travelling to the far corners of the world... in search of extinct witches' treasures! Yet so many brave men succeeded! How happy the King will be! And how impressed the princess will be by their courage! Who's been chosen as her husband? I wonder? Princess, your bed is prepared. Good night. The princess has retired for the night. Thank you. You can trust us to protect her. Fancy obtaining so many treasures! It's divine assistance for those of us entrusted with the national finances. When's that heretic merchant coming? Next month... One idiot only brought back a book! He hasn't got a chance! Strange! It contains articles from the witches' period... but it's just an ordinary book. There's no magic in it at all. Never mind. I'm not sure it'll sell, but put it in as well... Anyway, now the kingdom will flourish and the people won't starve. We mustn't forget it's all thanks to the power of the Royal Family. No, not this. Oh... this is a toy... What is it? So many miraculous things from the past don't exist any more... The techniques used were splendid, but what excites me more... is thinking about the potential of the people who made them. I also might have such a potential. The witches have all gone, but this castle was built by people... and someone made this table... Princess...! Princess...! I'm not a stranger? Where's the Princess? I... It's me... Oh, it's you! My name's Dullabore. I have the honour of meeting you at last, princess! My feelings for you have been growing ever stronger. But they couldn't choose one suitor today, so there'll be another challenge. What? ...More treasure-hunting? But I understand it was your idea... Eh...? Well, yes... I'm here to tell you that however difficult the challenges may be... I'm sure I'll be the one to bring back the finest treasures to your heart. And then those ministers will take all the magical treasures again. I'm sure he's being used like me... Well... going to distant lands and talking to people must be... I think people created language so that they could understand other people. So what's it like talking to people who don't speak your language? Oh, I can tell you many tales of adventure about treasure-hunting... Searching for treasure for you, I travelled east an incredible way. And how many horses I had to ride! But even the horses never hesitated to sacrifice their lives for you... And there was a monster in the country I came to! It was horrible with things like bats' wings flapping on both sides of its head... and something like a huge snake on its face wriggling weirdly. Was it... a nose? I'm not sure... Why are you asking? ...Nothing... Anyway, I, Dullabore, slaughtered it... With what?! With my ancestral sword, of course! Then a tribe of brutal barbarians attacked me, Dullabore, all alone... Princess, don't look so worried! They were no match for the sword of Dullabore, who thought only of you! I killed them all one by one. Eventually I reached the Temple of Heresy and found the treasure. I heard they only eat grass... Those huge animals with the long noses are very clever and can even be tamed. What? It's... in a book. Ah, if you like books, I can get as many as you want! What's wrong with that? Being locked up in here... I can only experience the world by reading books. Who's locking you up? I shouldn't have told you such a horrible story. Those monsters and barbarians live far, far away. When we're married, I'll look after you as carefully as being wrapped in silk. You can live quietly for ever at the back of the castle. Checkmate! Outside the window... As my bridegroom, you'll want to rule this country, won't you? Well, I was born a man... Then look out of the window... and try to use your imagination fully. That's what you'll be facing... Oh! If this all belonged to me... So many people under those roofs, all with their own thoughts... There are so many, you'd be overwhelmed, wouldn't you? They may seem a lot altogether, but I, Dullabore... But each of those lives has meaning! Even I... have... though it's tiny... Princess... Those people might just have wanted to catch the man who killed their pet... and stole the treasures they'd carefully kept and worshipped... Everyone should consider other people's feelings, even just a little... But... it was all for you!! Yes, but I don't like that. It annoys me... Oh, shit! If you aren't feeling well tonight, I'll be off... Oh, beautiful princess with eyes as deep as a mysterious lake... and black hair as smooth as silk... Ooh, the radiance of silk... One day I'll touch those charming damson lips with my lips... Princess, would you rather sleep than talk to me? A souvenir from my trip... A rose from distant Africa. I'm keeping a more beautiful treasure in my treasure-box for ever and ever. A carefully-tended Rosa splendifora from the castles eastern flower-bed. Oh no, it's different from a lie! Elegant conversation should contain beautiful elaboration. I mean, describing trivial reality just as it is doesn't necessarily... Take your face for instance? Now to be honest about it...!! Shit! Trying to seek the meaning in their words is useless. They're the ones afraid of facing reality. They live by looking at the world through glasses of their own colour. The more you talk with people like that... the more you come to dislike yourself. How did you get in here? By taking the route you taught me yourself. I guess they discovered it by reading ancient manuscripts. Ah, I miss those! I tell you, when the world was only interested in fighting? Every castle had secret passages like this. So long ago... Then how old are you? You're a witch, aren't you? While I was playing a trick looking like this... the source of my magic power was stolen. Without that, I can't return to who I was. I heard there are lots of magic treasures here, so I made the effort to come up. Have you found it? What's it like? It's this big, very much like a crystal. It's not here in the castle. Can anybody use it to make magic? It's not that easy. You need to have the gene, but you wouldn't understand. The crystal's only a catalyst... that amplifies the ability artificially embedded in that gene. And if you can't find it...? That's the end of my eternal life. I'll age year by year from the way lam now, and eventually I'll die. Just the same as your limited life! Limited...? But, it doesn't mean you'll die immediately! There must be things you can do while you're alive! Oh dear! So you still believe there's some meaning to life? Of course I do! What? A real wizard? I'm surprised there are any still alive! Is he demanding his treasure back? No. It's something about the princess. The princess in this castle is very clever... or, rather, very wise. I doubt that she will ever be controlled by any of you! Mind what you're saying! If you don't believe me... ask those two knights over there. What on earth's going on? The knights who tried to steal a march on the others said... What?! She had the nerve to face up to them and call them a thief and a liar! So, what do you want us to do? Give the princess to me as my wife. Whatever you do to me, Boax, you will never win the princess! You won't lose anything by forming an alliance with a wizard. What...?! The magic treasures will be very useful for this kingdom's treasury... won't they? And I don't think you'll hesitate because I look so ugly. Anyway, this appearance is transient. If I marry the princess, I'm supposed to retrieve my normal handsome looks. Regarding the arrangement I have explained, we'd like you to approve... As always, Your Majesty, we are most grateful! May the light of your wisdom guide us for ever... What?! What?! WHAT?! Take action immediately! But I wonder what she looks like these days? We've brought a suspicious person from the town gate! A suspicious person...? On your knees! It's the princess! It can't be! She's just an ordinary girl from the town, isn't she? No, she isn't... Am I right? Yes, sir. Well, she was trying to leave town with the performing bear troupe. But, because she was holding this book... Here? hold him! So where are you heading? Well... I'm thinking of going east... Everybody has an identity, even the young apprentices. But I'm still nothing. By leaving, I was hoping to become something other than a princess... I want to experience even the failures awaiting me in the outside world. Is this some kind of curse? My daughter... Daughter, you must follow what others say. That's the only way to take... Daughter... But, I don't want to give up yet! "Curse...? "Cursed...?" "Is that what it is?" Who here is confident to undo the curse placed on the princess? If anyone can do it, it's a sure sign he should be her husband. Why me? Oh, what does that do? Graceful, pure white princess... You're not a lady to dash everyone's hopes, are you? No... not at all... Then accept my proposal of marriage. Oh... what wonderful words those are! Like that... That's what a princess should be like! Some magic from my hometown after all this time! But I can't do anything for her. I've decided to live as an ordinary person matching the way I am now. Once I leave here, I'll forget all about immortality and past memories. I no longer want this, either. Just rub it and up to three wishes will come true. You can save yourself with that! Even up here, we can hear the people celebrating the marriage of the princess! We'll stay at my castle until the day comes when I must take over this castle. I hope that day will come soon! Grovel!! It was about to die, anyway. No problem! There won't be any more long journeys on that. I kidnapped the princess just as you ordered... croak! It went just as pre-programmed in the crystal. Don't get carried away! Of course not. I collected this book as well. The princess will stay in the basement of the castle. It's a charming place. What did she say? "Yes, it must be a charming place." Yes, it's best to believe whatever you hear! Yes. "Yes." There's no need to fight against fate any more. It'll be an easy life. Yes... as you say... as if... "Yes... as you say... as if..." As if...? "You understand me perfectly..." ...just as if you were looking at yourself... "You understand..." Alright. I heard that! I've locked her in the dungeon... When I explained the situation, she said: "Then he's a wicked wizard to enslave a princess and lock her up." I told her she might be a wicked princess... shortening people's lives as she pleases. Huh! She should be grateful for not being killed immediately! I'm a civilized man... Isn't dinner ready yet? It'll soon be time for Ample to come. She was trying to take that book from the castle... Saying she didn't want to be a princess any longer. Suppose she wanted to become a witch or something... That's impossible. She wasn't born to be one. I'm sure you're right. Ample, we'll need more food. From now on, there'll be three of us. So your master's changed something into a person again? To talk to, just to kill time? Croak! I'm enough for that! I'm here... I'm here... I'm here... But my mind Won't work the way I want it to. If I've been enslaved by the wizard... I'll sleep here waiting for a brave, young nobleman to wake me with a kiss. However, I can't say this is a very suitable place. I was told I could save myself using this ring. No... Oi, princess! Here's your dinner. That's a magic ring. Ah, it's one for three wishes. My mother bought me one once. But instead of thinking about escape, she's cleaning her room! I changed her into a very stupid princess... My own magic, my life, guaranteed for ever... will now be shortened because of a young kid called Arete. So prophesied the crystal... It can't be helped! My family, which brought such light to the earth... and had the magic power even to spread out into the world of the stars... cannot be ruined so easily! I'm sure our civilization has survived and they'll come to rescue me. Surviving and waiting is what I find worthwhile... It's crazy! They'll never come, however long you wait. You'll be waiting till you die! I'm talking about the princess. She believes some knight or prince will come and help her. Stupid! Ugh! As usual, this barbarian food doesn't suit my palate! Hey, do me a favour. Use some magic... and produce some dishes from the wonderful world of wizards! Stop talking big like that! No... Would I produce food using magic... for a useless creature like you I created myself? I can produce any number of useless things that would suit you perfectly! Yes, that star will surely find me... soon. Huh... Time is infinite... Beautiful, aren't they? Huh! They're not real stars... Eh? What are they then? In the old days, my mates and I floated a little artificial moon up in the starry sky. It went off its orbit and has gradually disintegrated. The bits are now falling through the atmosphere. Wow! That's great! That's real wizardry. They're just like I expected. What are those? I collected the bits of star that fell down to earth last night. Huh! Ah, I'm so bored! Never mind, I was only doing it to kill time. Oh, you're here? What do you want...? Now the princess is going to do some embroidery... for the prince who comes to rescue her! Huh! Anything could happen tomorrow, but she's doing it to kill time. She really doesn't understand the situation she's in! Stupid! Be quiet! What's the matter with you? I can't stay quiet. I was born as a frog, but you changed me into your companion... I told you to shut up! Oh, damn! Damn! Thank you for making time to visit me... Don't let me see you! Answer me from where you are. About what? Do you really believe that you'll be rescued? Not one of your precious knights has ever visited this castle. So what are you waiting for? It's stupid! The fact that they don't come... means that I won't lose hope. I'll pass the long time doing embroidery. What are you going to do? I thought I'd changed that girl into a terribly dull and trivial person. You know, speaking of my magic, that magic... Damn! Going off its orbit and disintegrating!? Wasn't there a wizard around to repair it before that happened? Damn!! Grovel! Grovel! Where are you? Come here quickly, you slug! Here I am... I've changed my mind! I'll let her out. WHAAAT? The princess' suitors all went on a journey to find treasures. I'll make her do the same thing. But how will it affect...? She'll be helpless in the outside world. She'll be scared to death! I don't think she can survive alone. Ah, great master, knowing what she feels so clearly! Don't say any more! I must devise a really difficult quest. I'll get the key to the dungeon... Hey, where's it gone? Hey, look up here! I get to meet you at last! My name's Ample. I'm the village representative who prepares the wizard's dinner? Grovel's busy today, so I've brought your dinner in his place. I know a bit about you. Boax sometimes saw you at your castle in his crystal. I overheard him talking to Grobel, so I know about your problems. Ah, why is only this part of the castle built so strongly? How about that door down there? Can't you get it open somehow? ...Well, I've never touched it... What...?! But that man said this door will no longer open... Ah, how can you be so gullible? No... Anyway, have your dinner. There's a story I want to tell you. You can listen while you're eating. You don't have to listen! For a long time our village has lacked water. We can't survive much longer. I must listen to her! That wizard came along with an idea. "I'll give you water using my magic if you'll prepare dinner for me." It seemed reasonable. My grandma was a young girl then. She died seven years ago. Yet he's continued giving us water and eating what we cook... without ageing or dying! He even painted that picture up there on the mountain. He said it's a landmark to show where he is. ...I'm here... We live beneath the Wizard's picture, but we still own our own minds. Soon I'm going to dig a well. After my grandma died, I took over the duty of preparing his dinner. But I'll make sure my children will be able to decide their own fate. I heard that in the old days this whole area was covered in greenery... and many sheep wandered around freely like those stars. I want to talk with this woman, saying what I really think. Though I'm here... I... am here. I heard you! You can dig a well but you won't find any water! Anybody can tell you this land doesn't hold any water. So what? Don't waste time telling fantasy stories. I'll tell my master... You'll also be changed into a frog! Poor Grovel, if you'd stayed as a frog, you wouldn't have had to speak like that. Shut up! Even sounding sympathetic like that, you won't get any water. You'll go on the same until you die! I hope I can get you out of there soon? What's the matter? Something's filling my mind... Perhaps... Perhaps it's because I'm getting bored here with nothing to do... Bored? Yes... I can understand. Now you put it like that... Yes, I also had a time when I had to put up with everything all by myself. And that time... Alright, I'm coming! At that time...? Eh? At that time... don't laugh... I'd make up a story in my mind, step by step, right from the beginning. I'd get excited imagining what might happen next! Oh, how interesting! Please tell me one of the stories you made up! Oh, no. You mustn't peep into other people's dreams. You should think up your own stories. Think...? I'm in a situation where I don't have to do that... yet. You might be better off dreaming like that! Even if you can't do anything to help, nobody will blame you. Ah, the thread... As Ample suggested, it may be a good idea to create a story. But to do that, I'll need some paper and ink and a pen... No. She said I must create a story in my head... using the voices in my mind. Damn! ...Huh?! ...Is this it? But how do you read this? The words I have in my mind are "Oh, is that true?" "What an interesting story that was!" and "Please tell us some more!" Unless someone encourages me to start... This... yes... "There was once a rich kingdom..." I think I've heard this story before... "There were treasures of gold and silver, a fine king and a beautiful queen..." Yes, it's a nice story... "The queen died very young, leaving behind a little princess...? Oh, what will happen to that poor princess? "The princess grew up and shut herself up in the highest tower of the castle... hidden away from the world's impurities in a state of real nobility... and waited for a man fit to be her husband to come. So said the people of the town below. But the princess herself..." The princess herself...? I wonder? "But talking about the princess herself... she spent every day looking out of her window." There must have been a beautiful view... "Under the window she looked out of every day... spread the castle town... and under each of those many roofs, people's lives went on... each one slightly different." "The princess tried to empathize with each of those little shadows of people... and she considered every one of their lives. That was the only time that she could have any contact with other people." I'm sorry! "Without the princess noticing, her heart was filling with tenderness and envy." "There were as many different stories as there were people... and all the people were the hero of their own story..." Yet I... yes, even I should be one of them. What on earth is this story...? It's boring without a dragon or a witch with a crooked nose... A witch... "Then the witch said... "So you still believe there's some meaning to life?" "And the princess answered..." "Of course I do!" Right... I've got it! A really difficult quest for her! Grovel, bring the key quickly! Dammit! Haven't you found it yet? Oh, no! My master always uses the same magic! Rats! If you're good, he'll turn you back to normal! GROVEL!! You haven't been seduced by the princess, have you? Certainly not!! How can I give her the difficult quest without the key? Find it at once!! Ooh... Drat, I've lost it again! Damn! You're late! Princess, I'm sending you on three treasure-hunting quests! All those suitors had to do the same. You can't avoid it! Here's the first. Go due north to the rocky mountains that almost touch the sky. You saw them when we flew in. Climb up the highest, Windstop Crag, and look up at the blue-black sky. Long ago, my family's magic powers created a huge golden eagle. It still glides there! Bring back a fragment of the ruby in its eye. It's a magic ruby that can emit light however distant it may be. If you can complete that mission, I'll give you another. Complete all three, and I'll set you free! Go to the left! SWEAR! Using your ring, swear as a noble princess you will not return without the treasure! Make just one step backwards and lightning will strike you! Now, use the magic ring!! Now, as the wizard Boax has instructed me... Remember, if you break your vow lightning will strike! Now go! The road leads straight to freedom! That should keep her away for ever! Indeed... indeed! Step backwards... Ordering me as a noble princess...! He used the wrong recipe to stir up that magic! I am myself... I'm already free! I can go anywhere I want! Now, where shall I go? What shall I do? She said it was covered with greenery. I want to see it like that, too... Ample! Huh? Who are you? I wonder what the princess is up to? FUNCTION... CHOICE... STANDBY. Clairvoyance mode. Princess Arete's present location. PRINCESS ARETE'S PRESENT... MONITOR. That's here! Is the crystal broken? Shut up! But, it's alright if you can fix it quickly with your magic... SHUT UP! DAMN! Y-You mean... you can't do it? SHUT UP! You were saying proudly you're a member of a great wizard... But the truth is...!! For heaven's sake, shut up!! "The pebble of a water snake... This green pebble offers magic to quench a traveller's thirst. Put the pebble into a container and then fill it with water. However much water you pour out, the container will remain full." The green water snake's pebble! A magic tool the wizard put in here to produce... Come to think of it, I've still got Ample. Ample! Where have you gone? Ample! Come back! Come back and listen to me! AMPLE! Where are you? Come back this minute or I'll stop the water for the village. So doesn't this machine work? Ah, the gold channel's broken, so the light can't get through... This also used to be gold... Ouch! Come on, hurry hurry! Where's Ample? I... I dunno... I'm over here! Ample! Get the dinner ready, you stupid... No thanks! What have you done to her? I don't want to look after you any more! If you want some food, why don't you get some using your magic power? You can't do that, can you? Dammit! ...Her, too? Hey, anyone will do! Make my dinner to keep me alive or the water will be... But the water stopped long ago... Damn! Why did it stop? What are you doing here? Ah, I see... You removed the water snake's pebble. Damn! It's all your fault! You may be thinking you've won, but that's not even proper magic. It's just a trivial prop! Give me the pebble back!! If it's only a trivial prop, then you can create it yourself again. Why don't you do that? Maybe your magic skill's improved... but isn't it like a craftsman's skill, creating things for use by others? You're right! I only use the magic created by someone else! it can't be helped! The world turned over before I could learn more skillful techniques. Our continent sank under the ocean... At the time, I was still only a boy. So there was nothing you could do! It wasn't your fault... You've been getting so angry because you couldn't admit it! Oh, shut up! The only thing I can do... is change something into something else useless and trivial! It's the first and last magic I ever mastered... Damn! But just watch what I can do with that magic!! BECOME THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT THING!! But why do you degrade yourself like this? Oh, shut up! TRAMPLE OVER EVERYTHING! Dammit! ...The crystal! My eternal life!! You did it... You saved the village! Uh... Really... I was only thinking about you? You... Ah... Can I stay like this for a little while? Of course. Found it yet? Uh-huh... I'll go on looking for that crystal if it takes for ever. But what are you going to do with it? Change us all into frogs? Oh, shut up! Those immortal witches and wizards have all gone... Well, I'm still here... I... my magic... There's a different type of magic as well... Stupid! Who else can do magic? Let me try. Close your eyes... And imagine... Imagine what? Quickly! Close your eyes! What should I imagine? How about the place you want to visit most? The place I want to visit most? Yes. Well... let me see... It would have to be the place I enjoyed most. Ah, I visited the seaside once. Oh, I've never seen the sea! Haven't you? It's so vast... and the water's salty and warm... and the waves break on the shore like a rocking cradle... I was so young, running up to the waves and back again... I remember how light my body was... I wonder why... Ah, yes I was with my mother. Her sweet face was smiling at me... Were you standing on that faraway beach again just now? 1,000 years away... when great magic stored in people's hearts... and it can also be directed towards the future... Ah, yes... We were visiting the seaside... to see off a spaceship heading for the stars. I was thinking that one day when I grew up... I'd travel on a spaceship like that to the stars... You're not the only one who's special... Remember that everybody has got the some magic inside them... Bye! Goodbye! You can come back here anytime... This is your village! Where's she going? To find the golden eagle. But why? To complete the quest I ordered? It can't be... to hunt for the treasure? I don't think so... All those knights who engaged in treasure hunting in the past... I've found it at last! It really is still alive... Without a master... this golden eagle has been soaring here for over 1,000 years! What kind of power drives you? And what are you for? What were those who created you thinking...? People's minds are such a mystery? There's no way to fully understand them. But... flying so high!! From now on, I will spend my life among the people of the earth! Written and Directed by Sunao Katabuchi
