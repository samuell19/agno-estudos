We're coming in! -Did he take your wallet? -Worse than that! Come on, fella, lighten up now! Now, what's he done? MAN: I ain't done nothing. What's he done? I'll tell you what he's done. This son of a bitch has eliminated any chance I had of winning this race by not letting me in my lucky toilet! That's what he's done! Uh, Officer, I think I can handle this. See, he's a little superstitious, and, uh, before he makes a bet, he likes to go in his lucky toilet. -This guy won't let me in! -Is that it? Pretty much so, Officer, yeah. -Come on, let's go! Come on! -Wait a minute. This is my lucky stall. I don't have a snowball's chance in hell of winning this race if I don't get to take a leak and toss a penny in a pot! It has worked before, Officer. I'm telling you, let's move it! Come on! Come on! Come on. Come on. Let's get out of here! I hope your ass falls off! Up yours! [SHOUTING] Hey, what do you think? What are you doing? Can't you just say, "What do you think?" Do you have to say, "What do you think!" Look at this. What do you think? I think we bet on eight races, and we haven't cashed one ticket. I think we're in trouble, that's what I think! Look what you did. You know, you shouldn't be eating those things anyway. You know what's in hot dogs? I read it in the paper. -What? -Lips. What? Yeah, lips. They hack 'em off, grind 'em up and put 'em right in the dog. You mean... "Blllbbb" lips? No. [MOOING] Lips. Oh, for Christ's sake. Hey, where you guys been? Somebody's in his lucky crapper. -What? -Yeah. You know, he can't make a bet unless he goes down to the old porcelain wishing well. That's stupid. That's got nothing to do with winning. Yeah, well, he thinks it right. You're right I'm right. And the track knows all the stuff that's going on. I mean, you got a rhythm going, they'll do anything to screw you up! I'll tell ya, you take a lucky leak in a stall four times in a row, you win four races in a row. You go down the fifth time, I guarantee you, there's gonna be guys standing there in the stall taking a leak until the next race is over. And if you really looked into it, you'd find this guy's working for the track. I find it difficult to believe that a multimillion dollar business has got a team of guys out looking for lucky pissers. Yeah, well, they do! STUMP: Oh, jeez, I forgot to feed Ollie. We're on Death Row here, and he's worried about feeding some stupid goldfish. Why don't you leave him a bowl of lips? Hey, that fish ain't stupid. He actually watches TV. -How do you know that? -'Cause I watch him. That fish will stay in one position for a whole hour when Love Boatis on. I think he likes it 'cause it has to do with water. [TRUMPETS PLAYING] Rocket scientist. DOOLEY: Come on, guys, got any hunches here? Josh, what do you got here? -I like the three horse. -ELTON: Three's a pig. Well, what the hell you ask me for? 'Cause we were thinking about the five. Okay. I like the five horse. You can't bet on the five. He's got Sanchez on him. Do you believe this lard-ass? STUMP: What about the four horse? DOOLEY: This is no time to joke around. What joke? The four horse is 60-to-one. Yeah? There's a reason for that. He hasn't won in two years. Maybe he remembers the feeling. What feeling? Surprise? No, they say when a horse wins, he remembers the feeling, and when the feeling comes back, he wants to win again. DOOLEY: Do you believe this guy? We're down 60 bucks, and he's looking for a horse with total recall. Okay, that's it. Come on. We're going with number five, 20 bucks. -Let's go. Come on, get it out. -20 bucks? That's... ALL: Five apiece. Five apiece. What are you gonna do, buy the horse? We're down 15 bucks apiece. If we win this one, we're even for the day, okay? -I'm in, now loan me a buck. -Yeah. Five bucks? If we win, you can send the fish on a cruise. Come on! Now listen to me. 20 to win on the five, the Flying Dutchman. You got it? 20 to win on the five. [MOCKING] Yeah, I got it, George. Oh, come on, come on. We ain't got much time. Let's go. P.A. ANNOUNCER: They're at the post. The horses are moving into line. Waiting on Top Haul and Al-a-New. [HORSES WHINNYING] The flag is up. And they're off. Al-Calipe in the middle of the race track going for the early lead. Big Lenny is second on the inside. Flying Dutchman races third. Dorphin's Image is fourth, Ward C, fifth. Colopay in sixth position. Top Call is seventh, and Al-a-New is the trailer. Moving out of the back stretch, that's Al-Calipe in front by one. Big Lenny charging up a closer second. Flying Dutchman still holds third. Dorphin's Image's fourth, Ward C and Colopay. As the team turns for home, less than a quarter of a mile to go. Here comes Flying Dutchman on the outside to challenge. And down the stretch they come! Al-Calipe quickly ahead. Flying Dutchman on the outside charging up! It's Flying Dutchman on the outside. And it's Flying Dutchman getting to the front and winning it by three parts of a length. [CHEERING] -Ha ha ha! -Ahhh! All right, we're even, boys. Way to go. We, uh... Oh, no. Tell me you got the ticket. -I got the ticket. -All right. Tell me you bet 20 to win. I bet 20 to win. So what's the problem? Well, there was this guy in front of me that was betting 300 on the two horse. What does this guy have to do with our lives? Well, I was thinking, since we were so undecided, and this guy was betting 300, I thought that... Excuse me. Are we to believe, and I think we are, that you bet our 20 on the two horse? Eat the ticket. Eat it. -What's he eating? -Two horse. Oh, they're good. Hey, if that don't fill you up, you can wash it down with a three. [ON RADIO] This is Dick Enberg with sports. [FADING IN AND OUT] There was an old-fashioned brawl in Cleveland... A fly ball that hit the right field foul pole was... Called... A home run by umpire Carl Hawthorne... Come on! Come on, work! Ow! Hit the pole. Oh, my. Both benches cleared... Oh, my knob. Cleveland Medical Center for observation. Final scores... [RADIO FADING IN AND OUT] [ENGINE CLICKING] [TIRES SCREECH] [RADIO] Pittsburgh was rained out. -Hi. -They're in the garage. Hey, troops. Hey, Stump! Hang on. We got a big thing going. A guy could make a fortune here. Will you deal out the whole hand? Any beer? He's dealing one card at a time. It's in the tub. -You only get two apiece, so pace yourself. -Is that right? What would you rather have two good beers or four cheap ones and spend the whole night taking a leak? Will you deal out the whole friggin' hand? That's not how you do it, all right? A guy could make three dimes here. Did you see that guy on the news last night? He won 200 grand in the lottery. Yeah, but it's not steady. You see, the guy bet his shoe size, 7 1/2. He bet 7-1-2. Now, I got 9-D. I know I can't bet "D", but I do know that it's the fourth letter of the alphabet, so I got 9-4. I'm still one number short. So what I do is I subtract four from nine, I get five. Now I got 9-4-5. I'm gonna give it a shot. What do you think? What's all this newspaper here? Huh? Oh, Madge put it on here. She doesn't want to get any water stains on the table, okay? The toilet's running. Dool, the toilet's running. I heard. There are people coming to look at the house. You gonna sit there and let the damn thing run? Got one more card, Madge. Your life is one more card, one more beer, one more belch! [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] Mm-hmm. -All right, pair of sixes. -All right. Deuce. Nuts. Dooley, you got newspaper on your ass. Huh? Madge didn't want him leaving water stains on his chair. [LAUGHING] -The toilet. -What's it doing? What do you think it's doing? It's sitting there running. Probably that little chain. Got an extra hairpin you could wrap around there? Not to spare. I got an even dozen. Maybe you'll hit it big tonight, then I can pick up another dozen. Can we get rid of this stuff, for crying out loud? Get a blanket or something? I feel like a canary. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. We take the paper off, but don't get any water stains on this Blue-Chip baby, Madge will kill me, all right? MADGE: [SHOUTING] Don't take that paper off that table! She sees through walls. She's the only broad I know who has "the change of life" every day. No, no, no, you just don't understand her. That's the prettiest little wee in the valley, boys. Just got to know how to handle her. Watch this. Madge? Could you bring us some potato chips, sweetie? [GLASS SHATTERS] Who in Christ's name do you think you are? I am not waiting on no bunch of freeloaders! For 10 years these bums have been coming over here! I've never known one of them to bring over a bag of chips! Is she gonna get those chips or not? Here are your built-ins. Plenty of... Excuse me... Storage space. Could we have a look around back, please? Sure. You can go out through the garage. Great. Follow me. How long has this house been on the market? Uh, the market... A little over a year. But we've had a lot of activity on it. We're talking Plum City. Hi, guys. Don't let us interrupt. Well, this is your combination rec-room and garage. With a little imagination and a couple of bucks, you could do a lot for this house. Well, I suppose you could say that about any house. [MOCKING] Yeah, I suppose you could. But this is a perfect example of a house that could be... Something. WOMAN: Does this house have a pool? [LAUGHING] A pool! No. No, I'm afraid this isn't your typical pool neighborhood. You've got to move uptown before you get into pools. No, ma'am, this is just a typical, nice, low, middle-class neighborhood. But if this isn't what you're looking for, I got a nice little creampuff in "move in" condition right at the corner of Hudson and Bal... [GRUNTING IN PAIN] You folks want a beer? REALTOR: Ow! [THUNDER RUMBLING] P.A. ANNOUNCER: Tickets for all remaining football games are on sale at the box office and at all ticket outlets. Tickets for all remaining football games are on sale at the box office and at all ticket outlets. LOU: Two beers and Dooley's in the can for an hour. ELTON: I hate watching football in this slop. You know, it kind of reminds me, it's a day like this that I lost the old lady. How long has she been gone? Who? Did you ever see the headstone Mr. Sentimental over here sprung for her? Hey, come on, don't give me that again. That was a very expensive plot. Oh, yeah. I'm sure. When the guy carved her name on it, it was like writing on the head of a pin. "Edna Shelton, a spark to light the room." And she did, too. Boy, when she stuck that fork in a toaster, wham! She blew the toaster, her ticker and eight fuses. When are you gonna get married again? Never. You want to know why? All broads are the same. They won't let you touch them when you're going with them. They just keep telling you how good it's gonna be when you get married. So what do you do? You marry 'em. And I'll tell you something. It's nothing. It never gets any better. So you ain't going up for the hair of the dog again, huh? No. A shame to take a catch like you off the market. Well... Open the door! LOU: Hey, It's Lawrence of Arabia. -What do you want? -Open the door! We ain't got any. Open the damn door. -Think it's gonna rain? -Yes. Open the door. Jeez. Is it coming down out there! Hey, you know what? I saw those guys, Tony and the guys. They're down there about four rows. Do you know what they're doing? They're cooking. They got a canvas over the tailgate, and they're cooking. We should have thought of that. Hey, what about the steaks? They ain't gonna hold up unless you cook them before the game. Hey, you know, I was thinking. Why don't I just fire up back here? Hey, that's great. I'm starved. Okay, okay, but don't spill nothing. Hey, guys, I got some hot stuff. Guess who I saw in the can and guess what he told me. -I saw Santiago. -STUMP: Oh, yeah? What's the deal with Santiago? Make my steaks rare, will you? Yeah. Well, he's got a live one. LOU: Oh, don't start. Another hot horse, huh? The last time we got a tip from one of them track guys, the horse started on Tuesday and finished on Thursday. That's 'cause he pulled a tendon. Yeah, dragging his ass around the track. Well, this is different, guys. Santiago's in on this one. He's got some stuff that he's gonna give this longshot, and he says it can win by daylight. -Yeah? When's this horse go? -Oh, hey. Got a nibble. Hey, Dool, will you check that out? The thin ones cook just like that. The horse goes on Wednesday in the second race. Now, look, guys, here's what I figure. I say we all put in 50 big ones apiece. He's the only stiff I know who calls a dollar a "big one." Santiago says that he gives this stuff to the horse, the horse will run from here to Detroit. -Why is he telling you about this? -'Cause I give him shoes. When I'm through peddling a line of shoes, I give him the samples. I always got a trunk full of those wingtips. How many times have we sat around here moaning about getting in on this, getting in on that, and we don't? Maybe this is the big one? I say we put 100 apiece on this turkey and quit screwing around. I don't know, that sounds like a lot of money. What are you talking about? You're the one that brought up the idea! Lou's right. Money talks, bullshit walks. Right. Remember when we missed betting the Jets in the Super Bowl? And Namath told us he was gonna win it! LOU: He didn't exactly tell us. He also told the world. STUMP: Yeah, but the point is we didn't take the tip. LOU: That wasn't a tip, that was a freakin' public announcement. This is a tip! Now, do we take it, or do we sit around here talking about wet wool and playing with our meat? Flip mine over, will you, Dooley? -I say we take it. -ELTON: Stump's right. You don't want to turn down a good tip when it comes along. -What do you say, wingtips? -Uh... I don't know. It really... It sounds like a... A lot of money. LOU: Well, I'll tell you what. I say we go to San Diego... Santiago... And we say to him, "Look, if this horse is for real, "we waltz right down to the track and stick it to him." Let me put it this way. If this horse wins, you can tell Madge to take the card table, pin curls and the toilet and stick 'em. I'm in. LOU: All we really need is... Air! Air! [COUGHING] You ass. You could have killed us. Don't let the steak burn. [LOU COUGHING] [SLURRING] So what's the beef anyway, Madge? I sell shoes all week and smell feet all week. You'd want to get out, too. [HORN HONKING] Get over, lady! You give 'em a car and... They want the whole road. [GRUNTS] [GROANS] Okay, so... So, Madge, you go to the game, have a couple of beers, so... So what? You got a roof over your head, don't you? I'm home. I am home. I'm... I'm home. I am home. [BELCHES] Boy. I'm "mome." Well, there's no place like "mome." Uh, you want me to, um... Uh, look at the toilet? Look at the toilet. Look at the chair. Look at the rug. It's your "mome." I'll get it. Uh... What you "weading?" The "Weader's Digest." It's about a guy who sold shoes, made a fortune, retired, and spent the rest of his life just sitting around looking at his... Toilet. I'll get it. I might have to shut this down for awhile. Do you have to go? I went yesterday. Oh. I'm lucky. [TOILET RUNNING] MADGE: Don't smoke in my bathroom. You always smoke. It stinks up the place. You never have any consideration. [MOANS] MADGE: And don't throw your butt in the toilet. [SIGHS] You been using a lot of paper, Madge? [BUBBLING] Hmm. [BUBBLING] Hmm. MADGE: I don't know why you think you're handy all of a sudden. You're not a handy person. Your hands are weapons. MADGE: My mother had your number, kiddo. Oh. MADGE: Heartache and pain, that's all I've had from you. And broken toilets. [MUMBLING] Oh. Ugh. Uhh... Beautiful. MADGE: Don't get water on the floor. Yeah. I'm getting it. I'm getting it. [BUBBLING] Oh. Whoa. Whoa. Oh, God. Ahh. Oh. Ahh. MADGE: And don't get my new brassiere dirty. Madge, your toilet died. So last night at midnight, I got to call a plumber. Some clown who calls himself the "Dapper Crapper." -Morning. -Say, Dooley, you don't happen to have a couple bucks on you, do you? -Sure do. -Dipshit. Hey, I tell you, those are faggy cigarettes. How many ballplayers do you know that smoke a "Daisy?" Is that right? I smoke 'em because I bum 'em off Madge, and that's the only kind she buys, okay? Did you ever hear of a guy making a touchdown, spiking the football and saying to the rest of the guys, "Hey, this one's for the Daisy"? Ha ha! -Whoa! -Hey! DOOLEY: Do you believe that Nicki Dixon broad? [GROANS] -What do you got, Toby? -I got rhythm. Cute. [FLY BUZZING] Got any of these without fly shit on 'em? No, we all out of the clean ones. [MAN COUGHING] [FLY BUZZING] [MAN COUGHING] [FLY BUZZING] One regular, one black, please. [COUGHING] [COUGHING] 1.80. Here, get yourself a lung. [INDISTINCT CHATTING] You come up with the hundred yet? Nah. Madge's has got the bank book hid again. She used to keep it in her drawers. You mean you got to look at her ass to get the bankbook? Dresser drawers. Boy, if she finds out I'm gonna take 100 bucks out of the bank, man, big trouble. Hmm. Santiago. Please, those are the worst-looking pants I've ever seen. They cover my nuts, don't they? Santiago, what's the deal with this horse? You keep this under your hat, man. Not even nobody knows what we are doing. But I tell you. We got this horse, French Majesty. I'm gonna give him this stuff called "torachi." And stand back! The bucket is gonna run! Ha ha ha! With the money we be making, I'll be down in Tijuana sucking down tequilas! What a minute. What do you mean the money "we" making? You got to put a grand down for me, compadres. BOTH: A grand? That's right. What you think I do this for anyway? What about the shoes I've been giving you? Yeah. I've been meaning to talk to you about that. They the same foot. Don't you got any shoes for the right feet? Well, they don't give you rights in the samples. So, what's the deal? Are we in or off? Okay, we're in. We'll make the bet for you. [LAUGHING] No, you give me my money, and I make my own bet. That way, we keep things square. You're not looking at no dummy, you know? He's right. So, you bring me the money, and the horse will run like the breaking wind. See you Wednesday, amigos. Adios. Tacos. Oh, you're right, man. This is big stuff. -You're not kidding. -Come on. Oh. Uh... Nice design, huh? I beg your pardon? I'm the one you decorated with the mud. Of course, that's okay. I was, uh, gonna plant flowers on my pants anyway. [BOTH LAUGHING] You see, with the manure on my pants, I got a pretty good chance of 'em growing. Uh... [MUMBLING] -Seems like a lot of fun. -Hmm. [MUFFLED MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me. I thought this place was gonna go topless. Oh, no. You get a real bum crowd then. You guys gonna run up a tab, or are you going to put this on your Sears card? Listen, I think we ought to forget about this whole thing. We are not in this kind of money league. Wait a minute. Maybe this is the big one. You remember Angie said we should buy that lot at the corner of Crosby and Sheraton? That they were gonna put apartments there someday? We didn't do it, did we? And what's there? Crosby/Sheraton Apartments. Now we've got... I've been in those apartments. Now we got the inside information on a shot that can give us big numbers. They are nice, man. We're sitting here playing with ourselves... I was in a two-bedroom once. Plush. You know what I think? I think we ought to go to DeFranco. Are you crazy? You're gonna hook us up with him? You looking to get your kneecaps busted? We ain't gonna hook up with him! We just borrow the money from him. If you're gonna borrow money, go to a bank. Oh, that's good. "Excuse me, I'd like to borrow five grand "to lay on a horse they're gonna shoot-up in the second." Are you crazy? Look, you borrow the money for a couple days, then we shoot it right back to them. What if the horse don't win? No problem there. DeFranco shoots us. You remember when Gigante tried to get Franco for that 20 grand? You saw what happened to him, didn't you? Wait a minute. I thought that was an accident. His car hit a pole. The man ends up in trunk of his own car with his ears stuffed in his mouth? That's some kind of an accident. Look, here's the deal. You get the money. Now, if the horse wins, then we... -[CRUNCHING] -We just get the money. We pay it back... -[CRUNCHING] -We got no... Stop! -Stop! -What? Stop this... When I'm talking! All right! I say we hit this thing as big as we can. And maybe for once we'll catch up with the rich bitches. -He's right. -[JINGLING] I am tired of sitting around waiting for crap to fall off the back of a truck so we can buy it at half price. I'm in. In. -In. -Ow! Here. Hey, that's 2.25. The meter says 2.00. Yeah, but you listened to the music. Here's for your music. Yeah, go on, get lost. You believe that creep wants another quarter for listening to his lousy tapes in the cab. Everybody's trying to suck every dime you got out of you. Here you are, gentlemen. Hope you have a very pleasant meal and the best of evenings. You want a tip? Don't look directly into the sun. Deliveries are in the rear, gentlemen. It's all right. Mr. DeFranco's waiting for you. Dooley, boys, sit down. Sit, sit, sit. There we go. Here, I'll... -You go over there. -Excuse me. [ALL TALKING] There. [SNAPS FINGERS] Well, how ya doing? Fine. Fine. Good. That's good. -How's with you? -Great. We're all fine. We were talking about it on the way over. We're hanging in there. [NERVOUS LAUGHTER] I'm hanging in there also. Good. LOU: Yes, sir. Uh-huh. Yep. You boys want some calamari? STUMP: Hey, that's octopus, isn't it? Geez, I got a buddy. He says eating that stuff is like eating a bowlful of little plumbers' helpers. [LAUGHING] What the hell does he know? So what's the story? We're interested in making a small loan for a short time. How much? DOOLEY: Five big ones. Uh, not big ones like $5.00, but, uh... How do you say 5,000? 5,000. DOOLEY: Right. That's... 5,000. I didn't know the term. That a lot of green for guys in your league. Well, that's why we're here. [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] This isn't anything the boss would be interested in, is it? Oh, no, I don't think so. Small potatoes. Because you know, sometimes something good comes down... [SNORTS] Fusco likes to get cut in on the action. He does... We're aware of that. But I don't think that this is, honestly, anything... [SNEEZES] That, uh, Fusco would be interested in, because this is really in a sense... [BLOWS NOSE] Not, uh... Sorry. Not anything that he would be interested in because... [PLATES CLATTERING] He seems to be interested in larger deals. LOU: Yeah, yeah, this is small peanuts. STUMP: I hate wobbling tables. I'll get it. What is it? DOOLEY: Land. We're thinking of buying a lot... Up on Tollen's Point, and putting in a hot dog stand. It would be small hot dogs and, uh, small... Small buns. So you can see that Fusco wouldn't be interested in this because he's... He's big hot dogs. STUMP: Dool, is that better? DeFRANCO: You want five, huh? Five big thousands. It's gonna cost you. Yeah. STUMP: I need a matchbook. DeFRANCO: 10% of $5,000 is $800. Excuse me. Uh, 10% of 5,000 is... 800! Right. I... We weren't carrying our one. Is that too steep? DOOLEY: No. No, no, no. That's fine. Nice round figure. DeFRANCO: When do you plan to get this money back? -DOOLEY: Wednesday. -Whew! Uhh! Wednesday? That's an awful quick return. Well, we were gonna sell hot dogs on Tuesday, and then if they didn't go, then we would, uh, sell the hot dog stand and get the money right back to you. All right. Sounds good. You decide, you come by and let me know. ALL: Thank you. DOOLEY: Thank you very much. STUMP: Hey, Dool, check it now. Stump. [PLATES CRASHING] -Yeah? -We're going. Oh, boy. That guy really meant business. How about that interest, huh? 10% of 5,000 is $800? Yeah, but who's gonna argue with him? That guy could hit you so hard on top of the head, you'd have to unzip your fly to eat. LOU: This is the third night in a row for this stew. [SLURPING] Me and the guys, fellas... Eww. What the hell is with this meat? When you get two of those, you get a prize. I've got three of 'em. I could reconstruct the cow. Anyway, we're gonna... Pass me the salt. Why, are you sweating? Just pass the salt. Anyway, we're gonna invest in this... Do you want a drop cloth? Anyway, it looks like a great project. Any more bread? In the freezer. Freezer? It makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? You buy a nice soft loaf of bread, you put it in the freezer. Then when you take it out of the freezer, you toast it so you can eat it. You got any frozen butter? Anyway... As I said, this is gonna cost a lot of money, and I'm not sure, but I got a good feeling about it. I'm gonna break my teeth on this stuff. Anyway, it seems like it's a proposition that I should go into, except I'm still a little shaky. -Is that pudding? -Ooh, it looks like pudding. I just have a feeling that everything is gonna be great. I just know that this is the thing, the one that's gonna put us over the top. The big one. [AIR HISSING] Empty. Well, you have had quite a day. Look, I got to decide something. Now, supposing you had a chance to make more money than you ever made in your whole life, say now or Wednesday, and you had to put up some really big money to do it, but you really weren't quite sure that it was gonna work out, but you just felt that you just had to try it, because you've never even taken advantage of anything like this before and you felt, "Well, I got to this time!" So you decided, "What the hell? I'm gonna go for it!" But it was still a little iffy but almost for sure. What would you do? You gotta get professional help. Yeah. [ANNOUNCEMENT ON P.A.] Hey, Jelly. What's doing? Hey, Mr. Dooley. Mr. Elton. Losing weight, feeling good. Ha ha! -Where's Santiago? -I think he's in the can. You know them tamales go off about every half hour on him. Ha ha! But he be back. Hey! French Majesty. When was this? Oh, that was about three year ago at Thistledown. That's the last time that old boy won. And he won that day for old Jelly. When he see me standing there in that red shirt yelling for him to hit the wire, he puts it into high gear for old Jelly, and won. He's running Wednesday, you better get out the old red shirt. Oh, no. I don't do that to the old Majesty. He ain't been the same since. When he see that red shirt, and he break his heart to win for me, but those old legs of his ain't got that kind of try left in 'em. No. Don't want him busting himself up for old Jelly. No, sir. Swell. Yeah. Ay, mama! Oy! Uhh! [SIGHS] Boy. These fucking shoes are killing my feet, man. Forget about the shoes. We got to talk here, huh? Talk, man. Look, about the sure thing. We are thinking of getting some money from a... A certain party, and we expect a lot of heat to be coming with it, so we don't want anything to go wrong. Look, all I is know is that horse will be in front by "day's light." Does the jockey know about this "day's light?" You guys put a couple of hundred on the nose for him, he'll ride till his ass falls off. A couple of hundred for the jockey? What the hell is this? Listen, when you guys give me the money, I give the horse this, and it's "Goodnight, Eileen." If this shit don't work, I give you my hat to chew on. Come on. I'll show you. DOOLEY: He'll give us his hat to chew on? You guys keep the balls of your eyes on the fence down there. Now, you see that I only put a pinch of this shit in this carrot, man. I'll show you. Come on, hilly-billy. Of course with a horse, the shit takes a little longer to work. [GOAT BRAYING] But with this goat? Ha ha. You'll see what I mean. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! You see? You can put kerosene on that goat's tail, he won't run no faster than that! You may be right there, huh? Okay, look, uh, we'll get you the money before the race, all right? Come on. Did you see that? Hey, Elton, it's that Nicki Dixon. Watch her try to make a move on me. Oh, I was, uh... I was just checking to make sure they were even. The stirrups. Uh, you ride much? Occasionally. Well, like they say, "Once you've been in the saddle, you never forget it." Is that what they say? Maybe not. [KISSES] Man! Do you believe that? She really is crazy about you. Look, I try to tell you. You know these rich broads get kind of tired of those mint julep-sucking tennis players. They start looking for a guy to give them a little variety, you know? I see what you mean. She had enough steam coming off her to shave that goat. DOOLEY: Guys, we're playing with fire if we try to get the money from DeFranco. Dool, I've been thinking. You could pull this off for us. All you got to do is to waltz over to Miss Big Bucks and see if she'd be interested in giving us a little backup loan. What are you talking about? Nicki Dixon, the broad at the track. You say she's got the hots for you. Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. I'm not selling this body. You mean that piece of shit is for sale? Listen, you don't have to romance her. Just go to the loan window. Those rich broads love to tell the girls at the club how they lent 10 grand to some putz for no reason at all. And then maybe with a little wine, a little song, maybe you'll get lucky. He may be able to do a little singing and a little sipping of the wine, but when it comes to women, his winky is retired. Winky? A grown man calls the old joystick a "winky?" Why can't you call your whizzer a winky if you want? Because it's stupid, that's why. Who, besides him, do you know that would a dork a winky, right? Yeah. Yeah. You call it what it is. There, you see? What do you call it? A monkey. You're gonna get us this loan with a jug of wine, a loaf of bread and a monkey? Yeah. Have I ever let you guys own before? Check! Oh, no. You take this one. Can I help you? Uh, do you, uh... Do you have self-park here? Not that I know of. -Hey, are you with the band? -No, I'm not with the band. I'm here to see a Miss Dixon. Oh! Hey, she's great. Listen, pal, don't worry. We're gonna take good care of your, uh, car. Right. Looks like we might get some showers. You want to put your window up? Oh. Right. Thanks. Oh, gee, this is great. This is swell. This is a lot better than those glass windows you can see through. All right. Now, do I, uh, need a ticket here or anything? Aw, don't worry. I have a pretty good eye for matching up driver and car. All right. Good. Just take care of it now. Okay, mister. Uh, listen... First gear is busted on this. You got to put it in second, all right? Okay. -Anything else? -No, that's all. Hey, mister, it may get windy out. You better hold onto your hair. Hey! Hey! Hope his face breaks out. [RINGS BELL] -May I help you, sir? -Uh, yes. I'd like to see a, uh, Miss Dixon. Yes, sir. May I announce you? No. No. I, uh... I don't want anybody to know. No, I mean announce you to Miss Dixon. Oh. That would... Yeah, go right ahead. Yes. Who shall I say is calling, please? Uh, just tell her that the, uh, cigarette man is here. Oh, no, no, no. On second thought, tell her it's the guy from the track with mud on his pants and a wet cigarette. She'll know. Good evening, Miss Dixon. There's a gentleman here from the track with pants and a cigarette. Mud. Mud on the pants. Mud. Mud on the pants and some cigarettes for you. From her. Cigarettes are from her. It was wet from her, and I got... From you... I believe. MISS DIXON: Oh. In that case, send him up. Thank you. She's in room 503. Oh. Thank you. Uh... [RINGS BELL] What floor is that on? Five. 503 is after 501 and 502. You see, the rooms are numbered in order. Oh. Thank you. Miss Dixon must be getting desperate. -How you doing? -Doing. I was just passing by, and so I told the guy to park the car... So he did. What an amazing experience. I think I got something you're gonna be interested in. We're talking big bucks. I know you're big bucks, but we're also big bucks. I think you'd be interested in this. Come in. Yeah. Well, I thought I'd give it a shot, so... -Pardon? -In. Come in. All the way in? [WHISTLES] Boy, this is good. Uh, you got this by the day? I live here. You live here? Every day? Every day, Mister, uh... Huh? Oh, Dooley. This is... This is a hotel, isn't it? Dooley? They get a little uptight about you hanging onto a room like this? I mean, uh... Don't they have to rent these things out? Uh... Of course, I guess your living here would be the same as renting the room out, so... Would you like a cigarette or anything? No, thank you. I was just about to have a little repast, Dooley. -A what? -Snack. Oh. Yeah. I guess I could choke a little something down. Mmm. That's, uh... So, you have a few ponies, huh? Oh, about 30 all over the country now. 30? I don't have that many. Of course, not that I don't have that many. I don't have any. But, uh, I go the track quite a bit, so I feel like I got them, you know what I mean? -Fondue? -What? Fondue. The cheese. -Oh, fondue. Yeah. -Try one. Oh. Sure. Yeah, I try to get out there a couple of days a week at least, you know? Aah. Aah. Wow! [COUGHS] Boy. Somebody really threw the heat to those babies, didn't they? -I'll be careful. -Mmm. Mmm. Ah. -[EXHALES] -Sandwich? Hmm? Oh. Thank you. [BLOWS] Mmm. You have a paint spill there? Oh, that's a painting of my best stallion, Conduction. Where? Right there. That's a, uh... That's a horse? It's two horses, actually. -He's mounting a mare. -He's what? An artist friend of mine painted it after watching Conduction in action. Oh, yeah, I, uh... I think I can see that now. That's, uh... That's some stud. So, uh... Boy, no wonder you stay so thin, these... Aah! -[DOG YELPING] -Darling! -What the hell was that? -Come on. Behave. Boy, between the dogs and the cheese, you really got to be on your toes around here, don't you? -Care for more? -No, I... [CLEARS THROAT] No, I'm... I'm jammy-packed. There's champagne. Would you open it? DOOLEY: Oh. Sure. Thank you. Are you married? Hmm? Uh, married? Yes, married. Married. Uh, why would you ask? Some people are married. I was just wondering. Well, I guess, technically you could say I am, but I'm not a fanatic about it. Well, you look a little inhibited. Really? Inhibited? Me? [CORK POPS] Aah! Sorry. Must have got a hold of a bad bottle there. Oh, that's okay. It gives me an excuse for slipping into something more comfortable, as the old cliche goes. [SIGHS] What do you say, mutt? [BARKING] [BARKING CONTINUES] [BARKS] -[KISSES] -[BARKS] Aah! Oh! Jeez! [BARKING] All right. Get the cigarette, boy. [WHISTLES] [BARKING CONTINUES] Ah! Oh. Shut the frig up, will you? [BARKING CONTINUES] Jeez. Uh... Uh, jeez. Uh, that's pretty. There was an accident. I think the dog took a crap. [BARKING] Now... You wanted to talk business. So, step into my office. This is where I do business. And you do want to do business, don't you? I was hoping to. Here. It's just a little something for you to slip into. You can change in the bedroom. Swell. Oh... -[DOG BARKS] -Shut up. Hello? Yoo-hoo. Um... [CLEARS THROAT] Uh, what I'd like to talk about is a loan. Get in. Oh. This is kinda nice. You look like him. Who? My first. First what? My first man. My first love. He was a jockey. A jockey? Lyle Dorf. Lyle Dorf? He threw me over. Destroyed me! For another woman. That's terrible. Um, about the loan... I searched everywhere after I got out of the sanitarium. Sanitarium? Every race track, every stable, wherever there were race horses. I found you, Lyle. Uh, Dooley. I've waited a long time for this. I'll make sure you never cheat on me again. Uh, I believe you have me mixed up with somebody else. [LAUGHS SINISTERLY] I'm going to have my revenge at last, Lyle Dorf. I'm beginning to wrinkle up pretty good here. I think I've soaked long enough. -I'm going to geld you. -Are you crazy, lady? Don't call me crazy! Don't call me crazy! -Ow! Your old lady's crazy! -[DOG BARKING] And it was your responsibility to get the car out of here, because I gave you the keys. Hot date, huh? Boy, you're lucky she only scalped you. Just get the car! All right! WOMAN: Look at that man. That's disgusting. I wouldn't talk, tuna legs. ELTON: So what did she do? DOOLEY: So then she comes at me with this knife! You mean she tried to cut off your monkey? Yeah! You're lucky she didn't cut off your coconuts, too. DOOLEY: Yeah. I didn't know I was swimming with a lunatic. LOU: Swell. Thanks to you, we got to go to DeFranco for the money now. STUMP: I've been thinking, guys. Maybe I should do the talking. DOOLEY, LOU, ELTON: Forget it! [COINS DROPPING] -It's not going up. -You got the eye of an eagle. STUMP: It's still not working. LOU: What are you gonna give us, news updates? We can see it ain't working. LOU: There. Go. Wait a minute. There it goes. ELTON: We're gonna be late for our meeting. Hey! Stop that! That thing! Stop it! -I can't get out. The door's stuck. -I can see that. Will somebody please get out and grab that thing before it wrecks my car? [CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Come on, Dool! They gotta call somebody about this thing! Higher! Grab it higher, Dool! Get it when it comes up! I got it. Hey, get off the hood! Get off the hood! LOU: Get the goddamn thing, will you, Dool? Dooley, you're denting my hood! -Grab it! -I got it now! LOU: Come on, quit clowning around, Dool! I'll back it up! LOU: Put another quarter in it! Uhh! Uhh! Watch the... The hood ornament! Uhh! [HISSING] STUMP: Aw, jeez! [GROANS] Dool, get the door. The window still works. Roll it up. There's a draft here. STUMP: Oh, for Christ's sake! My car is ruined! Why do we have to take off our shoes? 'Cause the sign says to. I'm surprised they don't charge you to park your shoes. [LEATHER SOFA SQUEAKING] Oh. [SQUEAKING FARTING SOUNDS] [ALL GROANING] Good morning, Mr. Fusco. Hello, Mr. Fusco. Mr. Fusco, I noticed a problem with the parking thing. I did have quite a bit of car damage in your parking lot. I put three quarters in the... [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] I'm gonna catch him later on that thing. May I help you? Yes. We're here to see Mr. DeFranco. Your names, please? Just tell him that, uh... Lou, Dooley, Elton, and Stump are here to see him. He'll know. Mr. Lou, Mr. Elton, Mr. Dooley, and Mr. Stump are here to see you. FUSCO: You don't have the money? MAN: I'll get you the money, Mr. Fusco. If you just give me a couple more... Uhh! Aah! -[PUNCHES LANDING] -[FURNITURE CRASHING] MAN: Okay, okay! I'll give it to you! Right. Mr. DeFranco will see you now. [LEATHER SOFA SQUEAKING] You better oil that couch. It's kind of squeaky. DeFRANCO: Come in. Sit. Sit. This is an awfully nice building Mr. Fusco has here. The sign out there, the "Fusco Imports." What is it you import? Lots of things. That's good, because, uh... [LAMP SQUEAKING] People need lots of things. Leave go of the lamp. [LAMP SQUEAKS] So... You boys are gonna go into the hot dog business, huh? [SNORTS] That's good. That's good. Is that for us? Right. Thank you. Uh, pardon me. There's no name on this. I was just wondering if, uh... It's for you. We don't ever make mistakes. It's all there. Just like I said, we don't make mistakes. [CLEARS THROAT] You know, uh, when you boys borrow money from Mr. Fusco, he expects that money to come back home. Kind of like the swallows coming back to Capistrano. [LAUGHING NERVOUSLY] You probably notice sometimes some of those swallows, they don't come back. It's because they got a busted wing or two. I've noticed that. Yeah, that's why I got a fish, 'cause he can't fall down in the water. I think he had a bruised fin one time... If you'll excuse us. We have to run along now. We still got hot dogs and buns to buy yet. Thank you very much, Mr. DeFranco. We're... Leaving. Going now. Uh, who's the horse? Uh, that's one of Fusco's horses. It's called Faratia. Named it after his mother. Yeah? Did she run here? I never heard of her. -His mother? -No, the horse. Yeah. Yeah, it raced once. Came in second, so Fusco had her destroyed. Destroyed. You mean, uh... [WHISTLES] You boys play the ponies? Fusco's got a horse going Wednesday. He's odds on, so he's not going to pay very much. But you put a few bucks on it, at least you'll have one winner. Name is Papa Chippy. Gave it to his dad as a gift. Paid 150 grand for it. LOU: Wow. But it's running with a bunch of dogs, so it should win by daylight. -That's great. -Thanks a lot! What race is that? The second. Is the door locked? ALL: No! No! -Thanks a lot! -Thank you! Thank you very much. STUMP: Maybe we should do the hot dogs. The second? Yeah, the second. You know something? If they had a contest for losers, the four of us would be tied for first place. How can you eat? 'Cause it could be the last supper. Look, why don't we just give the dough back to DeFranco and forget about the whole thing? Oh, sure. It's gonna cost us 800 bucks interest to look at five grand for two days. This whole friggin' deal's going right down the toilet, and I already got a brand-new camper picked out I'm gonna buy. Let's take a look at it. -What? -The money. Jeez. I've never seen that much in one lump before. Oh, my God. What? There's ten here. -Ten what? -Ten big thousands. You're kidding! Don't start. Give me that. It's ten. All right. What the hell is this all about? It's bait. They know we're onto something hot. They figure we'll blow the whole thing, they're in for an extra five. And we owe another $800 interest. Why don't guys like us ever get a break? I mean, how many books of tickets have we bought for St. Mary's? And who the hell wins the car? Some rich guy. He's got nine cars in the garage already. I mean, why don't, for once, God say, "Let the peons win one." [ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHING] LOU: [THINKING] Look, I don't want nothing, but these three losers could sure use a break. DOOLEY: [THINKING] I promise I'll try to get along with Madge. ELTON: [THINKING] If we win, I'll give half to the church. Uh, maybe not half, but a sizable donation. STUMP: [THINKING] A new fishbowl for Ollie. And a camper. You guys gonna get anything? I got to remember to feed Ollie. Remember to feed Ollie. I got to remember to feed Ollie. I got to remember to... I forgot to feed Ollie. I gotta feed Ollie. Gotta feed him right now. [KNOCKING] Hey. You dope! Look what you did! Ollie! Oh, my God! Ollie! You see this? You see what you did? Ollie! Oh! Hold your breath! I'm coming! I'm gonna save you, Ollie! Hold on! Ollie! Ollie. Ollie, you gotta do something. You gotta breathe. Come on, breathe. Water! Water. You gotta get to water. No. There you go. Here's some... There you go. Water. Water for Ollie. Here comes the water. There we go. There. He's swimming. He's swimming now. Ah. See? It's like I'm telling you about life. You never know when you're gonna buy the big one. One minute you're swimming, and the next minute you're laying on the rug drowning. You gonna be okay? If we win today, I am gonna buy you a pond, and you will never ever have to worry about falling out of the water again, I promise. Here's your air hose. [BUBBLING] So, um... Maybe, uh... Maybe I'll stick around anyway. Yeah. I think maybe I won't go out. -[DOOR CLOSES] -[CAR STARTING] Bye, Ollie. [TIRES SCREECHING] MADGE: Sure! Run off when the toilet's leaking again! We got a gusher here! Old Faithful! Run to the races with those bums, those microbes! You're leaving a drowning woman! You rat! LOU: Bye, Madge! -Where have you been, huh? -Ask the driver. Oh, the air hose on the fish tank busted. I had to fix it. Hey, don't worry, though. I got a shortcut. Biggest day of our lives, and he's home pumping air to a 20-cent goldfish. Hey, I've been watching that fish for 11 years! I just can't let him breathe to death. [TIRES SCREECHING] ELTON: What's to watch? All this thing does is waltz around the bowl stirring up the shit at the bottom. LOU: Where the hell are we? I thought you said you had a shortcut. STUMP: I do, I do. We're almost there. The track? Shortcut. Oh... Why would you screw around on day on like this? This is life or death to us! Shh. Can't you see the man is worried sick? What's he worried about? We're gonna lose? Hey, let me look at the money again. Oh, boy, that's really big bread. You think that's really big bread? If we win this thing at 40-to-1 with ten grand bet on him, we're talking close to... Really big! [TIRES SCREECHING] Oh, look at that. I paid 8 bucks for those retreads, and it's flat. Got a spare tire? [SPITS] You jerk. Why in the hell wouldn't you carry a spare? -For what? -Oh, I don't know. Might not be a bad idea at a time like this. I have one. It's on the car already. Great. We're all set. Let's pile in. Oh, quit screwing around, will you? If we miss the second race, we're dead. I'll see if I can flag someone down. Yeah, see if you can find a '73 Ford. Boy, there ought to be a ton of 'em going by at this hour. Come on! We'll hitch a ride and leave this heap here. Jeez, I hate to leave her out here like this. This car has driven us to 11 years of football games and racetracks. Is everything you own 11 years old? The friggin' fish is 11. This car is 11. The lousy cheese dip you serve has got to be banging at 11 years now. Hey! Yo! DOOLEY: Catch this guy in the truck. [WHISTLES] Hey, hey! Right here! Hold it! Yo, buddy. You stay here. Be right back. You boys got a problem? Yeah, we got a flat one, right around here. -This right rear tire. -Yeah. [LAUGHS] Why, shoot. It's only flat there on the bottom. -[LAUGHING] -[LAUGHING] Got a spare? Stump? This man asked you a question. No. No, I don't. You... You don't have a spare? No. No, I don't. [FLIES BUZZING] Hmm... No spare, huh? [BIRD CAWS] Nope. No spare. DOOLEY: This is worse than watching Stump's fish. I say we bang him on the head and take the truck. I really don't know what to tell you. Which way are you heading? I'm going down there to Falls View. I've got to pick up a couple of bales of metal sheeting for them gutters that run around my barn and hang down, you understand? No, I've never seen your barn. Well, it's a beautiful barn. I live about, uh... Oh, about three or four mile this side, in Stanton. You know that fruit stand, that boy that sells the two-day-old fruit? And that boy with that odd eye, you know? No, I don't know about the fruit stand, either. Say, I wonder if you could take us to a funeral home. -Funeral home? -Yeah. We had a buddy cash out on us here, and we were just on our way to pay our respects. What funeral home? Where? You know where the track is? -Racing track? -Right! As a matter of fact, you could drives us to gate five, and we could walk to the home from there. It would mean a lot to my friend, and I'm sure it would the same to his wife. God rest his soul. What are you saying? He's dead? Oh, God. Just a moment of prayer. Oh, Lord... Hey! We were wondering if you could drop us off at the home. Yeah, I suppose I could, but... Would you do me a favor? I do have to stop off at Harmon's hardware store. We... We don't have the time for that. The opening prayer is at 1:00, and we'd really like to be there for that. Well, being as it's you guys and all, and you're bogged down, yeah, I'll take you there. Get him in the car, boys. You ride up front. He gets a little sick, so he's gonna ride up front with me here. STUMP: Jeez, I forgot to lock the car. LOU: Let 'em steal the damn thing. DOOLEY: Will you forget about the car? Who the heck wants a yellow bomb anyway? Look, if we don't get... -Now, do not pet the animal. -Oh, my God. Yeah. He's bit a lot of people. Move it! -Come on! -Get in, idiot! DRIVER: Want me to come along, explain to the widow why you're late? DOOLEY: No, thanks anyway. DRIVER: I could pay my own respects. ELTON: We'll tell her you sent them. DRIVER: Come on, Captain, we'll go on up there to Webber's and get you a great big soup bone. [FIRST CALL BUGLE SOUNDING] Hey, guys, we got 15 minutes to post, so let's get going, huh? Hey, group. Nice outfits. Is the circus in town? I see you brought your sister. How come you ain't home watching your fish? I got a picture of myself I leave by the bowl. -Hello, boys. -Mr. DeFranco. -Oh, Mr. Fusco, how are you? -Good. Why? Do you know the "Lizard" here? -Mr. Lizard. -Hey, Liz. Miss Dixon here. Uh, we go to the same health spa. How's the wiener business? Well, she tried to cut it off. Uh, it's good. The hot dogs are fine. We have some kids up there taking care of it now. We're gonna go over and check on them. They steal you blind if you don't check on them. -I don't have that problem. -DOOLEY: You don't. You boys ought to put a couple of bucks on Papa Chippy this race. Then maybe you can afford to buy a new lining. That's a nice color, green. You might want to take a little of that lining and put it on French Majesty. We understand that he has a possibility. Is that what you understand? You're yodeling in a canyon, little man. Longshots are for suckers. Stick with the money. Papa Chippy wins by 20. Catch you later. I hope the hot dog business works out, 'cause we like to keep the books balanced. You know what I mean? [SNORTS] FUSCO: DeFranco, watch these people. They make me nervous. LOU: Looks like Miss Big Bucks went for Mr. Big Bucks. DOOLEY: Good luck with his winky. Yeah, you hear that? He says his horse is gonna win by 20. Why don't we take the money and put it on this Papa Chippy? Will you shut up? I told you. We're going all the way with French Majesty. I'm gonna puke again. Okay, guys, here we go. 200 for the jockey, the rest goes on French Majesty to win, got it? Wait a minute. We got to make sure that Santiago showed up. Dool and I will go look for him. You guys wait here. We'll signal you if everything is okay. We got to make sure that he's gonna give the horse the... [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] -Uh, new shoes. -The new shoes. -Horse needs new shoes. -They've been killing him. -Haven't they, though? -Watch for us. -You see him? -No. What if that creep didn't show up? Hey! There he is. [WHISTLES] Ay! These shoes! Where have you been, mans? We had a long day, okay? All right? You gots the money? Yeah. You got the stuff? [WHISPERING] Here. [LAUGHING] Not to worry. I'll see you in the winner's circle. I'll tell the jockey you placed the bet, right? -Right. -Okay. Put that away. P.A. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, don't forget. This Saturday, the $100,000 Katherine Lederer Stakes. Reserved seats are now on sale. Join us here at the racetrack... Did you make the bet? Yeah, I gave it to the jock's agent. Where's Elton? He's still making the bets. Good. Okay. So we relax. Do you know Lyle Dorf? No. You look like him. Maybe we could get together after the races, and I'll tell you all about it... In my office. Sounds good. Hey, Josh, what do you got? Like I told you, Papa Chippy. -[LAUGHING] -Kidding, huh? What about French Majesty? How do you want to bet him? To live? What are you talking about? We think he's got a chance. -So did General Custer, pal. -Oh, really? Come here. Wise guy. Look, wanna tell him? -If he can keep his mouth shut. -Okay. Come here. Listen. We got some hot stuff. Santiago says this French Majesty can really move. Santiago, that weasel. He's a con-a-roo. What are you talking about? He used tell guys that he could make horses take off, you know? So, he'd get like a cat, give the cat a little piece of meat with a lot of chili sauce on it, and the cat would take off like a jet plane. So, Santiago would say, "I can do the same thing for horses." Of course, he can't. What he can do is take your money and then give you some lame excuse when the horse goes into the toilet. He's a dip. Um, I think I'm going to go get a beer, guys. We've been had. Elton! We got to stop him from betting! Elton! We got to stop Elton! Stop! Take the stairs. You go that way. Elton! Hey, Elton! P.A. ANNOUNCER: The horses have reached the starting gate. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. Have you seen our friend? He's... Oh. Excuse me. Two, three. -Elton? Elton? -Ahh! Oh. I'm sorry. Sorry. Afternoon. It's a lucky toilet, we're... Seven to win. P.A. ANNOUNCER: They're at the post. Elton! They put cow lips in these things. That's right, cow lips. Think about it. DOOLEY: Elton! [SHOUTING] What? LOU: The money! The money! -Did you bet the money? -The tickets! It's okay. Relax, you guys. I got the tickets. Oh, no! It's a setup. It ain't a fixed race. We've been had! P.A. ANNOUNCER: The flag is up. I'm gonna puke. P.A. ANNOUNCER: And they're off. In the center of the track it's number six, Capprezzo going for the early lead. Brookside Dream in second. Lord Holster's in third, then comes Papa Chippy in fourth. River Cody is next, Joe Benetti, and French Majesty is the trailer. Moving down the next stretch, it's Capprezzo showing the way finally. What's wrong with Papa Chippy? Nothing. Papa Chippy knows when to make his move. P.A. ANNOUNCER: And French Majesty is last. Oh, boy. Oh, my God! I'm gonna kill myself. Fusco will handle that for you. P.A. ANNOUNCER: As they move to the top of the stretch, Brookside Dream takes the lead. JELLY: When he see me standing there in that red shirt yelling for him to hit the wire, he puts it into high gear for old Jelly. Red shirt. Red shirt for the horse. -Red shirt! -He's right. Red shirt for the horse! [ALL SHOUTING] -Ahh! -Thank you. P.A. ANNOUNCER: Heading for home. Quarter mile to the finish. [CHEERING] Oh, my God. P.A. ANNOUNCER: And down the stretch they come. French Majesty coming up on the outside. Papa Chippy... French Majesty, the longshot, number seven, is flying in the middle of the racetrack. -Yes! -Look at that. Hey! Get the hell off there! Oh, no! Go get him, Nate! Hey! No, wait! You don't understand! Run, Dooley! Run! No! No! Whip him! Whip him! Whip him! Whip him! Whip him! Come on! Come on, baby! P.A. ANNOUNCER: It is stride-for-stride. Papa Chippy, number three, on the inside. French Majesty, the longshot, number seven, on the outside. Here they come through the stretch. Papa Chippy in the rail, French Majesty on the outside. Papa Chippy on the inside, he's pounding again. And it's stride-for-stride. Papa Chippy at the rails. French Majesty on the outside. Here's the finish! It's too tight to call! [GRUNTS] Did you see who won, guys? P.A. ANNOUNCER: A photo finish. Who got it? It looked like Papa Chippy to me. What the hell do you know? Who got it? Who got it? Did you see? Did you see? Who got it? DOOLEY: Hey, now look, guys. Just a couple of minutes until we find out who won, huh? GUARD: Come on, move it. DOOLEY: You're hurting my arm. STUMP: Hey, don't hurt my friend. Hey! Is anybody out there? Hey! MAN: What? Can you hear me? MAN: What do you want? [WHISPERING] Dooley, I got one. Hey, who won the second race? MAN: What are you in for? I'm not in for nothing! Who won the second race? MAN: I hope you fry! Boy, they sure don't make people like they used to. Can you imagine that? Fry. Dool, I want you to know that if Fusco comes after you, he's gonna have to go through me first. Thanks, Stump. I appreciate that. If something does happen to me, though, would you look after my fish? Yeah. Thanks, Dool. Okay, let's go. -You mean we're out? -That's right. Your buddies posted bail. Whoa, huh? Hey, you wouldn't happen to know who won the second race, would you? Check with Information. You got two ones? I'll give you a five. We need the change. I ain't got it. We're busted. Here. Get these two clowns out of here. I'll see you on the 14th. DOOLEY: Did you say we're busted? ELTON: Flat busted. Hey, guys, uh... I'm sorry. I thought we had a shot at a piece of the pie, and I really am... Don't worry about it. Maybe Fusco will lighten up for one time. No chance. One of his hoods gave Elton such a chop in the ribs you won't believe, just as a preview. Really?
