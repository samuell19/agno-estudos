Why don't you stare at this a while, you ugly bastard? - What are you doing here? - I'm taking the specimen. You can'tâ€œ I haven't prepped the cryostasis chamber. I don't want him frozen, Rowan. - I want him soft. - We've already discussed this. Well, I had to go over your head. I'm moving him to our Scranton facility. You can't risk transporting him through open country. This isn't open for discussion. His unique ability to regenerate lost and damaged tissue, it's just... It cries out for more research. You're willing to risk the deaths of civilians if he escapes? Yes. But I'm sure Sergeant Marcus and his men can handle the transfer just fine. - Sergeant? - Everything3 under control, ma'am. - Dr. Wimmer, please. - Rowan... He's no longer your problem. Can we get that rag off him? What the hell?! Oh, my God! - Get out of here. - What happened? I'm sorry. Cryogenic breach. Emergency mckdown. Oh, God. No! No! No! - Kay-Em? - No viruses, no bacteria. No toxins. It's clean. - It's so cold. - Wow. Someone want to tell me what that is? It's like a big kind of frozen storage thing. Probably a cryostasis unit. I'd guess early port series. Kay-Em? Quadra-Port 11. Manufactured in 2010. Precise historic records are inconsistent. - Anyone thinking what I'm thinking? - Open it up. - What the hell is that? - Humanoid. Organic composition is unclear. Can someone tell me what's on his face? Some kind of 20th-century carbon filtration unit? - It's a hockey mask. - Very good, Tsunaron. - What's a hockey mask? - Facial armor. Used in a sport outlawed in 2024. Amazing. Absolute museum quality. Are you paying attention, Azrael? - Yeah. - Don't touch anything. Guys, we've got another body here. - Kay-Em? - She's perfectly preserved. - Self-crystallization is at 25%. - 25%? Suggest extensive nanotech and phase one cell reconstruction. Wait, wait a minute. Are you... Are you saying that... That we can bring her back to life? Yes, but she is deteriorating. Opening the door has compromised her hibernation. Lou, get ready for dust-off. - We have a priority evac. - Copy that. Ready in five. Not 'live, now. Look out! 55 ccs of ethrine. You'll be fine. Fine?! I'm missing my arm! You're so pretty. Kicker, are the doors secure? - Locked and blocked. - Beautiful. Lift-off in three, two, one... Ha, ha, ha. Yeah! I love this part. - What did you find? - You won't believe it. Get the sarge on the horn. You hear, division four just entered the occupied zone? - Casualties? - Minimal. I'd love to know how we got this screwed up gig. I didrftjoin the corps to become a friggin' babysitter. - Brodski here. - Yeah, sarge, - we found a viable. - Say again? We found two bodies in deep cryostasis. The cam unit thinks we can resuscitate the female. Female? - Yeah. - Crutch, do you copy? Crutch, do you read me? Wake the hell up! - Yeah, what do you want? - They're on their way back. - Prepare for docking and prep the lab. - Yeah, yeah, whatever. - What does she look like? - She's cute. Yeah. And single. I'm so lonely. We need to get her to the lab. - You think you can bring her back? - We'll find out. - You're not going to bring him back? - No, it's impossible. Aw, shit. I forgot my arm. Yeah, here you go, dumb-ass. Hi, hand. - Any idea how long she's been down? - 4.55 centuries. That's one hell of a wake-up call. I'm bitchy as hell when I wake up. Did you just wake up? - Kinsa... - You guys always find the cool shit. - Where's Waylander? - In Lab One charging the bed now. Good. Find Stoney and Adrienne and get to Lab Two. Once we're in the clear, I'd like to check your circuits. Oh, I'll bet you would. It isn't like that. Adrienne, I need you in Lab Two. - You found something? - Two viables. - In what condition? - Perfect. We're attempting reanimation. - What can I do? - Use Stoney and Kinsa... - They're new. They'll slow me down. - Walk them through it. Run a complete structural scan, log them properly, and put them in stasis. I'll check back later. - Okay, where are we? - The board's all green, teach. - The N2's warm and ready. - Good. - Begin stabilizing cellular fractures. - Yes, Professor. Janessa, I need a full scan. Glycerol levels, - cerebral profusion, the works. - I live to serve. Let's see what we're dealing with. Decrystallization of the membranes is now at 32%. - Get those clothes off her. - Oh, I got it! I got it. Honestly. Waylander, where's her diffusion barriers? 17 and stable. Here we go. Stay still, or you'll get an elbow where your wrist should be. Specimen 4420 found in Sector 3930i on Earth Prime. Subject discovered in complete cryosuspension. - How's it going? - Hey man, what's up? - Where do you want this? - On the specimen table. - Hi, baby. - Hey, gorgeous. Initiating scan. Mmm, smart and sexy. Professor, take a look at this guy's scan. Amazing. How does he function with a brain that small? - Way manages. - That's very funny. - He's a big boy. - I bet he's hung like a mammoth. Okay, you guys. Just get the hell out of here. - Come back when you're more focused. - You serious? - Yes, just go. - Thanks, Adrienne. - Come. - Thanks. Don't mention it. See what you can salvage from the optic cortex, - then move on. - My pleasure, Professor. Ready phase two. Bring on the ants. That's it. Come to Mama. Temperature 96.2. 97. - Cool. It's working. - 98.6 and holding. Cell reconstruction is complete. Internal defib in three... two, one. Easy, easy. Vital signs are normal and strong. No shit. Easy, easy. Did you get him? Where is he? - Tell me you got him. - Got who? No one's here. You're safe with us. There was a leak in the cryo unit and... - Was he contained? - He was contained. But when the cryo unit ruptured, you didn't escape it. It put you into stasis. For how long? The year is 2455. Now, I know this is a huge shock, but you're going to be safe here. You're aboard Grendel, a class-four catamaran transport ship. We're on our way back home and you're gonna be just fine. 2455? That's over 400 years. Secure line. Perez, Dieter. Solaris research station. Connect. - Lowe, you bastard. - We've hit the motherlode. - Do you know what time it is? - I don't care. - We've got a gold mine. - A box of DVDs is not a gold mine. I've told you I can't move them. Just look at the file. Two 400-year-old specimens. One well-preserved, the other one... Are you ready for this? Up and walking around. 400 years old and walking around. Yeah. 455 years, to be exact. Who cares? Who gives a shit? People. People will pay huge money to see her. Let me ask you a question... Is this the first person you've reanimated? - Of course not. - How many people are out there today walking around, thawed out and looking good? - Hundreds. - Thousands. Maybe. But not 450 years old. - She's twice as old as anyone else. - 250, 450. What's the difference? Doctor, 100 years ago when re-animation was more unpredictable, sure, maybe. - But now it's old news. - Damn it. I need money. I know, I know. The other viable is marked "Voorhees." That's not Jason Voorhees, is it? What do you know about him? Jason Voorhees? He killed nearly 200 people and simply disappeared without a trace. Under the right buyer, he could be worth a fortune. We've got him frozen right here on the ship. - You work out a list of ownership? - No list. He's my find. He's mine. - What about your students? - They're students. The educational experience will be enough. Doctor, Doctor, you are one son of a bitch. Soon to be one rich son of a bitch. Lowe out. Professor, I think that... we need to talk about my midterm. Poor baby. No wonder you wore this thing. Harder. Harder. Who's been a naughty little boy? I have. - Harder. - You want it a little harder? - Yeah. - How's that? - Oh, God. That's it. - That's it right there?! - Oh, yeah. - Daddy likes it hard? - Yeah! - Daddy wants it hard? - Oh, yeah. That's it. - Right there? You like it right there? - A little harder for Daddy? - Yeah! - Come on, come on! - You pass! What do you think? - Do you like them? - They're fine. Look, Kay-Em, I don't think this is going to work. Why do you want those things, anyways? - Janessa has them. - Well, Janessa's... - Real? - Yes. Let's not complicate things, all right? I like you just the way you are. I think you're perfect. Okay. Help me! Somebody help me! No! No! No! I brought you something to eat. Not much longer and we'll be at Earth Two. Earth Two? What happened to Earth One? It's dead. The oceans, the soil, neither will sustain life. Can I do anything else for you? You want to tell me what happened down there? I take it being stabbed and frozen - wasn't part of your plan. - I'm a... I was a project leader at Crystal Lake Research. - The subject was Jason Voorhees. - Jason Voorhees? Notorious murderer? We executed him for the first time in 2008. For the first time? We tried everything. Electrocution, gas, firing squad, we even hung him once. Nothing worked. Finally it was decided that if we couldn't terminate him, we could at least contain him... Cryogenic stasis... Freeze him till we could figure out what to do. - Seems sensible. - I thought so. Unfortunately some people who were too smart for their own good, felt that a creature that couldn't be killed, was simply too valuable to just file away. In the end it always comes down to money. How do you thank someone who gives you back your life? You'll be alive for a long time. We'll figure out something. Why don't you just admit it? You want me. I could never be with a girl whose balls are bigger than mine. Guys, our star patient is back. Rowan, this is Tsunaron and Janessa. Ma. Ma. I see that my clothes fit okay. These are yours? They're great. Thank you. What are those? These are Janessa's love children. You see now, it is that wit of yours that is what repels all human females. - Of course you've met Sergeant Brodski. - Yes. Hi again. - Hi. - This is the lovely Kay-Em 14, Tsunaron's little love-bot. Easy, Janessa. Kay-Em is a knowledge matrix android that I have been programming. Amazing. - She looks so real. - I am real. - Where do you want this? - Lab Two, I think. Where did you get that? From your friend with the hockey mask. - You brought him on board? - He's in the next lab. We're safe. - "Safe"? - Scans reveal him to be very dead. Could your scans be wrong? You should get rid of him, he's too dangerous. That would be irresponsible and foolhardy. He's a valuable scientific artifact that must be carefully preserved. Much like yourself. He is an unstoppable killing machine. He's not dead. Believe me, he's definitely dead. Show me. I'm putting us on lockdown. Attention, we have a hostile on board. - Grunt team, report to weapons. - The chick? Repeat, we have a hostile on board. Grunt team, report to weapons. Everyone else, get to Lab One. Grunt team's assembled. Dallas is a no-show. - Sergeant... - Where the hell is he? - Don't know, Sarge. - Damn! Look, we need to talk. - Do you have all your kids yet? - Yes. Oh, God. Stoney... Stoney's dead. - Oh, my God. - Stoney's dead. Kicker! I want full armor and tac. I want nothing left of this guy by the time we reach Solaris. You heard him, Grunts, let's get moving! Nothing left of him? What have you got in mind? Take your kids to Lab One, and stay there till you hear from me. I just saved your ass. You know, don't get cocky. You must really feel like a wuss, huh, big boy? Check the score, kid, it's still 9-3. Yeah, but I got my groove on, you know what I'm saying? - What do you say, next kill wins? - Lock and load. You're going down. You are so going down. - What the hell? - I thought this was an alien sim. Yeah, it is. Pause play. - I said, pause play. - He's not pausing. Yeah, no kidding. I think we need to reboot. - That does not count as a kill. - Yes, it does. Okay, screw this. Game over. What the hell? Hey, drop the kid! Drop the kid! Now! Azrael, get out of here! I sot him! I sot him! - I got no shot! Move! - I got... - Sergeant Brodskiâ€œ - Don't leave those kids alone. - What's the matter with you? - We are less than an hour from solaris. They have seven fully-equipped tactical units, that are more than capable of taking care of this. - I say we wait and sedate him. - I am taking this guy out. - Sergeant, I need him alive. - No, you want him alive. What you need is to get out of my way! Look, there are other considerations. Financial considerations. My only consideration is the safety of the people on this ship. All right, $100,000. 200. - Five. - Five? - Dallas not here yet? - Nope. Find him, bring him up to speed. Condor, you have a BFG? You're with me. Sven, Geko, you got the starboard pontoon. What do we do when we find this guy? I promised the doc we'd take him alive. So after you blow him all to hell, put one in his legs so we can say we tried. Oh, Lord. - Sarge, I got Dallas. - Where the hell is he? He's dead. We got a body in Bay Two. - Who is it? - It's Azrael. What the hell's going on here? Sarge, blood trail heading toward the cargo bay. Condor, Kicker and I will take cargo main. The rest of you take port side. I hope they know what they're doing. These guys live for this stuff. Sorry. - Don't do that! - Dude. - What? - You scream like a girl. - Screw you. - You wish. Lou, is that you? Lou, you mess with an engineer, you're going to wake up in the morning with a waste hose in your bunk. Asshole. What the hell? Crutch, get down now! - What the hell's going on? - Crutch, out now. You wrecked my stuff. We nailed him. He's got to be here. Condor, airborne. Briggs. Where the hell's Sven? Condor, anything topside? Negative, Sarge. There's no sign of him. This isn't going to work. Keep your eyes peeled. Everything3 under control. Condor, report. Sven, report. Condor, report. Report! Damn. - Sarge, we found Condor. - What's his condition? He's screwed. Let's smoke this fucker. Sarge, Sven's dead. Jesus. You have got to get them out of there. They know what they're doing! Oh, man. Geko, Geko. I sot him! I sot him! Yes! Yes! See, they got him! Don't take your eyes off him. I'm on my way. Take your time. He ain't going nowhere. Briggs... get out of here. Geko, Briggs, where are you, damn it? He's all alone in there. It's going to take more than a poke in the ribs to put down this old dog. Yeah, that oughta do it. Such a waste. I told him to stay calm, to wait until we got to Solaris, and then we could take care of this monster. I said, "Don't go in unprepared." Brodski was just too proud. Who locked the damn door? Somebody want to tell me what the hell is going on? The Grunts are dead. - Which ones? - All of them. Oh, man. Lou, how long till we reach Solaris? I'm taking us out of hyperdrive right now. Kids and their goddamn field trips. Let's bring a psycho on board. Yeah, sure. I just know I'm going to get blamed for this shit. Grendel, we have you on approach. Stand by for docking number. Solaris, we need military and medical at the gate. We've got a big problem here. A real go-fuck. Grendel, what's your problem? What's your problem? Look, we're going to be all right. He's trapped in the cargo bay. - We're locked up in here. - Can the Solaris Grunts kill him? Absolutely. I've been in constant contact with Solaris. They have 60 highly-trained professionals standing by to get us off this ship. Pull up. Abort docking. You're coming in too fast. - What now? - Warning. - Oh, shit! Hang on! - Prepare for impact. What's going on?! What the hell is going on?! - Everyone okay? - What just happened? Waylander. We just over shot it. We'll turn around and go back. Hang on. Oh, my God. Solaris is gone. Gone? It can't be gone. Look for yourself. It's gone. What are we going to do? What sort of damage we looking at? I'm sending out a distress beacon. - Lou? - We've lost our entire port pontoon. The internal pressure is stable. Our main thrusters are off-line. - Life support? - We should be okay for awhile. - But he's out there. - We're going to be fine. We're in a high volume traffic lane, Another ship's gonna come by. I'm sure of it! We'll be safe here. Shut up! What are you doing? - Maybe he gave up. - You really think so? I don't think he's out there. Why don't you stick your head out and have a peek? Oh, my God! Go! Go, come on, go! Move it, move it! Come on! Let's go! Where's Professor Lowe? Hi. Look, have you considered how valuable you are? Fame, money. With my help, you could have it all. I know people. I have connections. Together we could make a fortune. Oh, shit. Oh, you want your machete back? Shit, it's yours! Take it! Just remember who saved it for you. Guys, it's okay. He just wanted his machete back! I'm... I'm... I'm gonna go back to my room. 'Cause Stoney's going to meet me there. All right, look. How do we get off this ship? - I don't know. - Could you beam us off or something? "Beam us off"? The shuttle. Hell, yeah. The shuttle. - What about it, Crutch? - Yeah. I can do pre-launch from the bridge. Good, the rest of us will head to the shuttle. - We'll start the launch list. - I'm with you, Crutch. You know how to use that? Yep. It's just like riding a bike. - Once you learn, you never forget how. - Good. Kay-Em and I will go to the supply hold. - We'll meet you at the shuttle bay. - See you there. What's a bike? There's enough firepower here to level a moon. I say we pack this stuff up and head for the shuttle. What do you think? Are we going to make it? The statistical probability of survival is 12%. 12%?! Can't you come up with better odds? - Nope. - Bullshit, Kay-Em! That's bullshit! Preparation for launch may be a relatively simple procedure, but getting there alive... it is a problem. Are you telling me there's absolutely no chance for us to better our odds?! Statistical probability of survival just went up to 53%. You want to go for 100? He's here. Quiet. But if he's in here, he'll kill us. Be quiet. One more sound and I'll snap your neck myself. - Got it? - She's good with people. - Did you see that? - What? I think there's someone still alive over there. We don't have time for this. Which way is the shuttle bay? Straight through. Go. I'll meet you there. Just don't wreck my pants. Come on, girl. We're going home. Oh, Lou. Jesus, that's twisted. Of course, I've seen worse. Okay, let's get to work. Brodski? Okay. We're going to get you out of here. - No. - Oh, God. I'm going to go get help and I'll be back. Give me your vest. Oh, bastard. Hey... be lucky you weren't alive during the Microsoft conflict. We were beating each other with our own severed limbs. That's nice. Okay. Let's get us home. - Kinsa, are you there? - Yes, ma'am. - Crutch? - Prepare for fuel transfer. - Cell six and seven bypass. - Hydraulic lifters. Pressurized and damped. - It's Brodski. He's alive. - No shit. Yeah. I can't move him. Are Way and Crutch back? - No, they're still on the bridge. - I need help. Hey. Guys. Brodski's still alive. But Rowan can't move him by herself. Go, go, go. I can handle it from here. Tell them I'm on my way. Watch your back. Crutch, how we doing for time? With a giant shitload of good luck, we might be ready to go. Good. Rowan. Hey. Where's Brodski? L... he was here. I don't get it. And I am going home. Lowe! Oh, shit! I got company here, people! Let's go. Kinsa, open the door. Open the damn door! - Why aren't you on board? - Kinsa won't open the door. I think that she's finally lost it and this is a really bad time for this! Janessa, give me the comm. Kinsa, Kinsa honey, it's Rowan. I need you to open the door. No. Kinsa, sweetheart, it's all over. We can go home. All you need to do is open the door for us. No. Come on, guys! Jesus Christ, Kinsa, open the goddamn door! Oh no, Kinsa, the fuel lines are still attached! Kinsa! Now what? Now basically we die. Bullshit! Okay, new plan. You hold him and I'll run. Hey, SWPPY- I got a little something for you. - Oh, wow. - I gave her an upload. I'm afraid I'll have to hurt you now. Kay-Em! Thatâ€œ that didn't go so well. Gotcha! Hey. Giddy-up. I had it under control, but thanks. My pleasure. Yeah. - You did it. - Kay-Em! Who's your mama? All right! - How you doing there, Brodski? - I'm all right. Come on, let's get you patched up. What a mess. Lab Two. - Tsunaron, is he going to make it? - Absolutely. He's at 80% already. This guy is strong. What the hell? Way? We've got trouble. The collision must have compromised the hull. She's bleeding out. Oh, no. No, no, no. Tiamat to Grendel. Do you read? Over. Tiamat to Grendel. Do you read? Yes, Tiamat, this is Grendel. We read you. - Can you hear us? - That's affirmative. We are reading your distress beacon. - Are you in need of assistance? - That's very affirmative. How soon can you get here? Our situation is critical. We're four parsecs away, Grendel. ETA, 45 minutes. We don't have that much time. Tiamat, this is Grendel. Our hull is bleeding out. We're going to have a core implosion in less than 30 minutes. Do you COPY? We copy you, Grendel. Advise how you would like us to proceed. We'll end up taking them down with us. Tiamat... if you can't get here in 30 minutes, then there's no point. What? Are you high? Tiamat, this is Grendel. You just ignore that last idiot, all right? You get your ass out here, okay? You come here, and you save us! Hey, why can't we just go over here? It's no good. If the pontoon goes, it'll take the bridge with it. Not if we disconnect these walkways. - You can't just disconnect them. - We could blow it up. There's macrocharge in the weapons hold. This could work. Tiamat, we're going to try something here. If you're game, maintain your current course and speed, and hopefully we'll see you when you get here. Copy. See you in 45 minutes. - Good luck, Grendel. - Thanks. - Let's blow the walkways. - Come on. Let's put up separate charges. Who's got the remote? - Right here. - We'll meet up at Walkway B. - All set. - Good to go. Hold together, baby. Impossible. It's dead. I'd say he got better. He's been modified. Oh, you think? - Can you take him? - I could try. You guys might want to run. Kay-Em! No! Waylander! Brodski, get in here, now! Come on, guys! Come on! What the hell is going on? Jason-fucking-Voorhees, that's what's going on! - Blow the charges! - Waylandefls got the trigger! Hey... asshole. I think she's holding. I think we're finally okay. I'd clap if I could. Tiamat to Grendel. Come in, Grendel. We have you vectored for approach and emergency docking. You ready to get off that boat? Yeah, let's go home. Holy shit! We got to go! Now! Janessa! - Janessa! - Don't let go! Grab her hand! - Janessa! - Reach out! Reach for it! Come on! Come on! This sucks on so many levels! Janessa! Come on! Come on. Janessa. Shit, he's still coming. Come on. Go! - Which way? - This way! This way! Come on. - Tiamat, we're at the evac door. - So am I, Grendel. Lifeline secured. Initiate collar pressurization. Tiamat, open the outer doors. - Damn. - What now? - Tiamat, escape hatch won't open. - I got this. I've got this. Let me try and override. Shit. Shit! Shit! Come on, come on! Our exterior motor's got no power. - What does that mean? - It means I'm going E.V.A. - E.V.A.? What's E.V.A.? - It's a space walk. If he can jump the lines, we can reroute them in here. Hopefully that door will open and we can get off before it blows. - Sounds like a good plan. - This is Grendel. Our escape hatch is jammed, we're going E.V.A. to patch it. Better get a move on. - I'm in the maintenance hatch. - We read you, Sarge. Opening outer doors. Those hatches aren't going to keep him out much longer. We need to buy more time. You're the expert on this guy, right? - What are you thinking? - A diversion. I'm at the control panel. - Rowan, are you there? - Yes. I'll divert the main power supply unit and send it to you. Gotcha. See the bright blue diode? Connect it to the terminal. Was that you or me? That was another part of your hull, Grendel. You are running out of time. Okay, just a few more minutes. We can disengage and come around again. Negative, Tiamat, just another minute. We'll stand by as long as we can. Uh-Oh. - You ready, Kay? - I was built ready, baby. Initiate. It's working! He's buying it! - Oops. - What, "Oops"? Nothing. No. You don't just say, "Oops." What "oops"? I think he saw me. If you've got something brilliant up your sleeve, now's the time to do it. I got something. I got something. Prepare variations using data file, Crystal Lake, 1980. - Kay? - Here goes nothing. Initiate. - Hey, you want a beer? - Or do you want to smoke pot? Or we could have premarital sex. We love premarital sex. - Try it now, Rowan. - Here we go. You piece of crap! Ow! Ow! - He's done with the campers. - Wow, he's good. He's too good. He's coming back. - Okay, try it again. - It's engaged! The door's engaged! Brodski, you are the man! Are we going to see you sometime soon? I'm on my way. Brodski, where are you?! Grendel, we can't keep pressure lock. - We'll disengage in 40 seconds. - Kay-Em. Kay-Em. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one... - clear! - No! - No, wait! - Disconnect. He's coming this way. You've got to be kidding me. Brodski. He's gone. I can't believe it. - Tsun? - Kay-Em. Are you okay? I'll be back on my feet in no time. - As soon as I have some. - I'll get right on it. It's beautiful. - Look at that. - A shooting star. Make a wish. It landed in the lake. Let's go check it out.
