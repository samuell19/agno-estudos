NETFLIX, NEWBE AND WW ENTERTAINMENT PRESENT A BNNVARA AND ROSE STORIES COPRODUCTION MADE POSSIBLE IN PART BY THE NETHERLANDS FILM PRODUCTION INCENTIVE Is it here? I think so. Are you sure, bro? Bro, it's here, right? Google Maps doesn't lie, bro. I don't know, man. You bring that shit? Trust me, sachbi. Come on. Hmm? What is this, man? Hurry up, man. We're late. Hey, you. Dresscode Scarface, whollah? I told you, dude. Join the party, drari. Whollah, you're a warrior, huh, cuz? Yeah, you're a warrior. - Hey, darling, have you seen Leyla? - No. No? You don't know. Girls, have you seen my daughters? Hmm. Of course, you can't see through those fake eyelashes. Brahim, my brother. Have you seen Amira? - No. - Useless. Oh, my God! Are you blind? Watch out! Hey, Jeff Gordon, come here. It was the first day of spring, the day the princess would finally marry. Her father had sent invitations to all of his three million followers on Instagram. The baker was panicking. Well, sure. How was he going to bake cookies for all those people? And that wasn't even the biggest problem. - Do you know what that was? - No. The princess wasn't even ready to get married yet. So she grabbed the king by his beard and said, "Hey, Baabaa, just chill. Take it easy, old man." And do you know what the king said then? Everyone's waiting for you. Come on. The story's not over yet. And then the king went to the princess, "If you don't get out there and get married right this second, you'll get old and ugly. And no one will want to marry you anymore." So, the princess said, "Okay, fine." And she lived happily ever after. Get up, come on. And on this day my fairy tale began. The fairy tale of Leyla, the 30-year-old princess... with a fear of open spaces. Hold on, I'll have to explain. A fear of open spaces, often called agoraphobia. A fear of places or situations where escaping can be difficult or embarrassing and where no one's help is available when panic symptoms arise. Everyone has come, even your favorite aunts. Hmm. I heard she's a hermit. I heard she cooks just as bad as her mother. I heard she's getting a groom from Morocco. I heard she was involved with black magic. I heard she's a lesbian. I heard no one wants her anymore. Right? She's like 30, isn't she? Meskina. ♪ We're swinging Fitlala We're singing ourselves fit ♪ ♪ We're jumping around Yes, that's why, rom pom pom ♪ And this divine diva is my sister, Amira. She's a real pain in the ass, yet the only reason I still get out sometimes. - My sister from the same mister. - Amira, what's taking you so long? Oh, didn't you know? I'm married to the only paramedic with no sense of time or direction. She's talking straight poop. - Poop? - Sorry, honey. - We'll be there soon, Leyla. - Thanks, Klaas. I bet Ma's gonna say I'm late again. Well, anyway, just hurry up, 'cause Abdelkarim will, uh... I know. He'll be there. But if Klaas keeps driving like this we'll get there once Yasmina's getting a divorce. Mommy, is that the police right there? Klaas, the cops. Okay, no worries. Everything will be all... Hello? Moroccan women at a wedding. If you weren't insecure yet after a four-hour visit to the hairdresser only to get a hairdo that falls apart after only ten minutes, - they will still be there... - Ladies. ...to point out all your shortcomings. Malika, my ambitious niece and queen bee of the neighborhood, as a kid she brought along a pillow to prevent her royal ass getting dirty from playing outside. All mothers at the wedding are gutted that she's not their daughter. Mirror, mirror on the wall, which zina is the prettiest of them all? So annoying. It won't bring me anything in the long run. Luckily, success is the new beauty. Oh. Hamza and I are going to Dubai next week. I'm organizing my first big gala. I heard about that. Congratulations. That's so great. And speaking of success, I heard that our favorite MDC will be attending the wedding tonight. Did she say MDC? Moroccan-Dutch Celebrity. Ah. - Abdelkarim. - Mmm. His Ferrari was spotted in the parking lot and I won't leave here tonight before I've talked to him. You were friends with him, right? Yeah, we... we traded cards back in the day. Perfect. See if you spot him anywhere. It is absolutely essential that I work with him. - Okay. - Okay. So, how are you? Fine. I'm working on a children's book. Sorry, but I have to take this. Yes? So what time do we leave for Schiphol then? Fine. Book it. Whoa! Whoa! That's Abdelkarim! Abdelkarim! Abdelkarim, the golden boy. As a kid, he once gave me a candy he had spat on. Now he's producing so many hits that it's like he's making the soundtrack of our time. All the fathers at the wedding are gutted that he's not their son. Malika, can you believe who's come here to see my daughter get married? Yes, Baabaa, I see. And that's my uncle, Ibrahim, the best-dressed man in Almere. At least, that's what he thinks. Do you remember back in the day? He was so little. So little! But look at him now. A true Atlas lion. Wow. Just like Travolta. What he does with his feet, Abdelkarim does with... Leyla, are you here alone? - Meski... - Mm-mmm. - Come, let's go see him. - Sorry, I don't feel too good. - I think I need to get some air. - Oh, darling. Hey, when I'm back from Dubai, you really should give me a call, because I can always use a good writer. Deal? Okay. Come, Baabaa. Thirty and alone at a wedding. It's still a thing. At least for people who are single. Not for me. Maamaa just gave me the look. I swear, Amira. The "wait till we get home" look? Exactly. That one. - Ouch, man. - What's taking you so long? - Oh, we got a bit held up. - Pfft. - Are you... Are you sure that it's here? - Yeah, it's here, hon. No worries, little one. We're here. Where, exactly? Did Yasmina invite Hindus also? Oh. Guilty conscience? Everyone was staring at me. And I... I just felt my face getting so flushed. Well, let them. They only see what they want to see. Yeah. Because when they see you, they see a successful, single man with money. And me? I'm just an old, single woman with a hobby that doesn't earn any money. Got me? Why don't you come work for me in the studio then? Because I'm so desperate? - Yeah, a little bit. - Yeah, a little bit. - And what would I be doing for you? - Massage my feet, trim my nose hair, - that sort of... - What? It doesn't matter. Just be with me full time, okay? Oh, you smooth talker. I do have a few demands. I want to scout new artists. And I want my own office, so I can work on my book now and then. All right, deal. And I really want your next song to be about me, okay? ♪ Leyla, my queen, no zina ♪ ♪ I love her, I need her by my side ♪ ♪ Leyla, my queen, no zina ♪ ♪ I want her, I need her ♪ Those are the lyrics? That's the title. Yeah, I don't think you're gonna be good for this job. - No? - No. Really? Gotcha! Shit, Maamaa, I, uh... What are you doing with my daughter? Uh... - Come here. - Geez. Maamaa, I... I was going to tell you today. Moms know everything. It's okay. Your dad wouldn't have minded, either. But never lie to me again. Yeah! Hey, we're here! Pull up! Pull up! - Where have you been? - Don't scream. - Where? - Chill. - My God. - Calm down. - We've been waiting for you all day. - Take it easy. - Don't scream. You're overreacting. - I'll scream when I want to. One person comes late, - and once that happens... - You could have called. After that night, everyone knew about Abdelkarim and me. Literally, everyone. ABDELKARIM SPOTTED WITH NEW FLAME? And so, the princess fell in love with the prince who made the best beats. WHAT A FEELING IN OUR LOVE NEST ♪ Round and round ♪ What can go wrong if your life is a fairy tale? - Here you go! - The right answer is: everything. 4 YEARS LATER How do you go from "Netflix & Chill" to "Netflix & Nothing"? Honestly, no idea. But one thing I know for sure now, if you don't watch out, your prince on his white horse will gallop away in a different direction. You still try all kinds of things. I MISS YOU. X But if that doesn't work either, there's only one place to go for some love... - and comfort. - Aha. Why are you always so late? Be glad we're here, Mother. - Here, Grandma. - My handsome lad. Come on, sweetie. - Yay! - Okay, I have dessert! - One for you. - Thank you! - Salaam alaikum, everybody! - Alaikum salaam. Hi, Najat. I picked the best things for you again. I have excellent, uh...

Yeah, really. Shokran. Next time, inshallah. You look very good in green. Salaam. Things aren't good with Abdelkarim and me. Doing fine, thanks. He doesn't pay attention to me anymore. Yeah, once you've been married for a few years, you gotta try your best, girl. You know what I mean... Ooh! Ooh! ♪ It's the sound of da police ♪ - Fucking hell! - Amira. - You're Playboy-hot, girlfriend. - Maybe he has someone else. I certainly hope not. By the way, our relationship has changed, too. You see, at this point, Klaas is like a daily cheese sandwich. - Salaam alaikum. - Abdelkarim! - Sorry I'm late. - You're not late. We were all early. Unbelievable. Sit down. Sit, sit, sit. Tomorrow after work we'll have lunch together, okay? I'm doing a music festival in Rabat next month. - King Mohammed will be there. - Oh, really? Wow. Wow. Hey, if you talk to King Mo, you should tell him that he really needs to take good care of his wife. Barking dogs don't bite, but Moroccan queens do. - No one ever says that. - Your mom doesn't say that. MEDICAL SPECIALIST - Hi, Patries. - Hey, what's up, girl? - Is she running behind? - She's almost done. You good? By the way, that song by your husband and Alicia X is bomb. ♪ Put it on me Like your wife isn't watching ♪ - Mr. Bergwijk. - Yes. - Hey. - Sis. I'll be done soon. This patient only has a minor problem. You know? Come along. Is it painful? Patries, he asked if it's painful! Of course it's painful. Don't be a wimp, Mr. Bergwijk. Do you know what us women have to go through? Excuse me? Could I borrow that for a moment? Pardon? Could I borrow that magazine for a moment? - I'm reading an article. - I promise, I won't take too long. I'm not done with it yet. - Just let me borrow it. - You can get another one. - But I want this one. - Yeah, but you can't have it. You wanna make this difficult? I think I will. Oh, yeah? Then sorry about this. Woo! My goodness! My, my! I don't need coffee anymore. NEW LOVE FOR HIT PRODUCER What? CALL ME WHEN YOU HAVE TIME!

Ha! Yes, pull up! I'll say one word about the pink elephant here. I swear on my father, God rest his soul, if I ever see him again, I'm going McGregor on his ass. - It takes two people to tango. - One person eats bullets in a tango. - No one ever says that. - Klaas, enough. Why? She is talking about someone who met the king in person. Baabaa, don't. The king's relationship isn't perfect either, right? God forgive us. - Leyla will easily find a new man. - She won't find a man like Abdelkarim. Oh, a man who mistakenly put his penis into a colleague? What are you saying, Amira? Listen, there's plenty of better fish in the sea. - Uh, Amira's right. - Thank you. - What do you mean? - There are lots of nice men. - Nicer than me? - I'm just saying, if you weren't here... Then you'd have someone else or, uh... - Uh, well... - That's right, sister. All I want to say... ...is that a good marriage is the foundation to a joyful and successful life. Wait until the publisher reads Leyla's manuscript. Her success will soon follow. Wait, what? What are you talking about? What publisher, Amira? I may have sent your manuscript to a publisher. You're gonna be the Moroccan Judy Blume. She could have done that if she was still married to Abdelkarim. - Are you still talking about that? - Who do you think you are? Now we're speaking Arabic? Oh, yeah? - You're the older one! You're older! - You're taller, but use your brain. - Klaas, say something. - Hmm? Everything's all good. COME TO THE OFFICE SOON. I'VE GOT A JOB FOR YOU! INSUFFICIENT BALANCE ORDER CANCELED Fuck my life. Fuck it. Fuck it so much right now. Ugh. Leyla. - Leyla? - Mmm. Come here. Look how young Dad and I were here. - How old were you here? - Twenty-two, I think. - And Dad? - Dad was 33 or 34. - He looked like a movie star. - He was handsome, like Omar Sharif. The whole neighborhood envied me. He was a good person, and handsome. He had it all. - Lucky you. - Hmm. Look at this photo here. He sent this one to me the summer he worked in a steel factory and this photo is how your father proposed. That's how he first asked me. You were so pretty. What did you expect? I'm still pretty. It's a gift. At first, I didn't want to come to the Netherlands. Not at all. Why did you come then? It was a different time. When I see this picture... I start to really miss being in my homeland. I was lucky to know so many good people. I can find you a man to marry there. You never know where you'll find love. You wanna marry me off? - Is that what you're saying? - Of course not. If I wanted to do that I wouldn't discuss it with you. Maamaa, it's the 21st century. - And I'm not that desperate, okay? - I know. But you want kids and to be able to own a house, right? You were happy with Abdelkarim. That wasn't arranged. What we had was totally different. The very idea is just silly. Leyla, I want you to be happy. You just want me to give birth to your grandkids. Excuse me, but I really don't need my mom's... What? So, it was that easy? The prince had caught his next prey and was moving on with his life. And me? I'd locked myself away in the top of the tower. Fuck that. Anything he can do, I can do ten times better. After Neon Road I started working for an online broker. I could have been a professional soccer player, but, um, you know how it goes. Y-Y-Your ex is A-Abdelkarim? I think we'll have lots of healthy babies together. Are you going back to Istanbul each year or what? I-I have a mixtape. Could... Could you please give it to Abdelkarim for me? I'd recommend Morocco to anyone I know. I've got lots of money. Okay, I'll admit that clearly wasn't a success. But regardless, I'll never ask my mom for help. Maybe it wouldn't hurt if I ask for help sometimes. You want me to set you up with a man? - I have nothing to lose. - Of course, I'm happy to look for one! Hey, Maamaa, don't tell Amira, okay? Do you know what you need? A boy toy. What you need is a hot guy who will... Okay. He will reset you and get your engine going again. Mm-hmm. Once you've tasted three donkeys, you'll get a bird with it. No one ever says that. Your dating profile doesn't say that. Let me fix that for you, huh? - What's your log-in? - Since when are you a dating expert? - You met Klaas when... - "You met Klaas when..." Log-in. LittleLeyla86. Password: fuck the princess. Don't judge. - You don't trust me, huh? - Mm-mmm. Hi there. What if I told you this gorgeous woman is up for grabs right now, huh? She's funny, creative and, as you can see, she's freaking sexy. - Sound good to you? - Uh, good. Hmm? - But, uh... - But what? Is she too exotic for you? No. No, I'm... I'm into men. Do your thing, bro. So, like I said, you're no expert. Come on, it's not like you're being married off here. Okay, fine, if it makes you happy, just go ahead. Okay, great. What will Maamaa think about this? Leave Maamaa out of this, please. Of course, sis. Dating is haram. She'll see you very soon. Dr. Idrissi is really busy today. Nope. Nope. Don't you ever look sexy in photos? Hello, Ghariba, how are you? How's Youssef? He's getting married? Too bad. Sorry, I meant... Hobbies? She didn't put any hobbies. I'll tell her. Inshallah. Her sister, Naima. You know, the neighbors' girl. You almost made me break my vase. Mm-hmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. No. No. Bingo, bitches. Who's up next? Don't tell me. I know everything about you. Malika's aunt and ex-girlfriend of he-who-must-not-be-named. You live in Almere, visit McDonald's twice a week, and judging by your outfit, you have no idea about the sort of company you'll be working for. Rayan, personal assistant extraordinaire. I only work for strong women who are too beautiful to work. Leyla, storyteller extraordinaire. A strong woman in poor times, looking for work to... - ...become beautiful. - Nice. Welcome to Diamond Events, soldier. Next week we have an important presentation for the Music Industry Awards, so everybody's stressed out. But I'm here though, yeah? You're meeting with Malika in a minute, aren't you? - Yes. - When talking to her, get to the point. Yeah? Time is money. Also muy importante, if she requests something, it's not negotiable, it's a to-do on your to-do list. - But... - So please, please, do not interrupt her, otherwise she'll go nuts. This is Malika we're talking about. My niece, Malika, not Ayatollah Malika? Is that the Turkish chick in Sales? Anyway, one tip, just act like yourself. What the Moroccan Meryl Streep? Malika? - You... - Come on, to the point. Been away from your life for too long. - Uh, Leyla, would you like a drink? - Mint tea with four sugars. - Yes, boss. - Come, no time to waste. Here's Marketing, Middle East, Finance and Control, Human Resources, Sales. And this here is your desk. Is Sunday your favorite day? Oh, all right. There's a lot to do. But you know I'm here to help my family out if I can. Thanks a lot, Mal. Hey, and if I can help you in return, like, uh, setting up the South American branch, one phone call and I'm off. Hmm. There are files with contracts. Look them over for any language problems and then you can send them back to Legal. But... can I work on the presentation for the Music Industry Awards? After all, I've worked in the music industry. And after our class trip to Parliament, I didn't immediately become prime minister, now, did I? Didn't Rayan explain how things work around here? I sure did. I explained. Didn't I? Mint tea. How's your little book coming along? - Well, I... - Sorry, I really have to take this. Yeah? Keep it short. How much? When I'm all grown up one day, I wanna be just like her. Leyla, my girl. I have fantastic news! He's from a good family. An ideal son-in-law. Ali's cousin. He has his own house and a construction company. He has a heart of gold, and he's handsome. Look. Well, at least it's not a frog. A chip off Ali's blocks, don't you agree? - What do you know about Ali's wood? - Shut up about Ali. I don't know about this, Maamaa. I don't know him. - Why are you so difficult? - No, come on. I just think they must have strange ideas about me. What's the problem? Enough. They admire you, so stop. Leyla, do you know what matters to me right now? Seeing you happy. Okay, give me his number. I'll ask him when he's free. This Tuesday, 7:30 p.m. Meet at Safir's. His name is... Omar, Diederik, Jamal... - Don't! - ...Jeffrey, Alejandro. - I knew you'd be popular on there. - Mama, that boy keeps pushing us. - Just push him back. - Okay. Nadia, help your brother for a moment. The first season of Game of Thrones is my favorite show? Yeah, I had to fill out hobbies, and you don't have any, which, by the way, is pretty pathetic, so I had to add some of my own sauce. Let him cry, guys. It's his own fault. What do you think of Roman? The name alone. Roman. - He's not Moroccan. - Who are you? 1954? Uh, excuse me, are those your kids? Yeah, thanks for your interest, but I'm hanging on to them a little bit longer. Shame on you. You're a bad mom. Care to repeat that, Karen? You're a bad mom. - You should be ashamed. - Here, hold my earrings. Come here! You don't know who you're messing with. Hey, Leyla. You're the first person I've ever messaged on this app. Online dating is not really my thing, but I couldn't resist because you seem very intelligent and your eyes are beautiful. I really mean it, even though it may sound stupid with a photo like this. A photo? What photo? LEYLA86 - 34 YEARS OLD ALMERE - MORE DETAILS Stop! Hey, next time you want to help me out, don't bother. Hands off me, man. Loser. Wow, my God! May Allah bless you! May Allah bless this beautiful girl! Maamaa, you're loud. You shall be blessed, my sweet beauty. Amin will be the happiest man on earth today. Look at you. Good evening, lovely lady. - Could I take your coat for you? - Uh, yes, you can. - Excuse me. - Okay. - Thank you. - Enjoy your evening. Leyla? Amin? - Here you go. - Oh, yeah. All right. Been married off before? Wow, sorry. - But, uh, are you always so direct? - Yes. Except when I'm looking for a relationship. Then I rely on my family. Uh, just to be clear, this is a regular night for me. As in a night out for two losers who can't seem to find someone without help from their moms? As in I'm not going to look further than tonight. I thought that was the whole point behind this date, Amin. Well, maybe we can pretend it isn't. We'll just have a chat over dinner. Oh, so we're actually eating? You're pretty funny. Are you saying that with the future in mind? 'Cause I gotta say, I don't mind cleaning things, but I don't iron. No problem, no problem. Then you'll clean my car and I'll iron. Hmm. Okay, okay, okay. Excuse me. Ah, great. Thank you. - Great, thank you. - Thank you. And these are my sister's kids, Nadia and Noah. Such rascals. You'll make lovely children. Mashallah. Say something, Leyla. This was fun. Yeah, I enjoyed it. - I don't know what I expected tonight. - No, me neither. You hear such horror stories. A first date, but it turns out the whole family is present. Uh... What is it? Well, uh... Actually, um... There, uh... There are my nieces, Selma and Salwa. And that's my brother, Ayoub, with his wife, Karima. My sister, Siham, her husband, Ahmed, and their daughter, Hanan. - And I'm Aziz. Nice to meet you. - Oh. - Amin's little brother. - Okay. And Bilall and Adil are back there. And behind you is my brother, Abdullah. And my sisters, Naima, Souad, Rachida and Bouchra, with Annoor. And my father owns this restaurant. Leyla. Leyla. You're such an arse. Arse. Arse. Leyla. Leyla, wait. - Please understand something. - What? That you're a psychopath, Amin? No, that I'm a family man. And that I took that too seriously tonight. I'm sorry, I should have told you. But I want you to know that I meant everything I said to you in there. I'm mad about my nephews. You're funny. I wanna iron your laundry. And you're beautiful. It was a stupid error of judgment. I made a mistake. I haven't had a night like this in ages. Hey, it was the first time I was married off. I'm sure it will go better next time. Ugh. That was so shitty. And fun. And shitty. Madam Idrissi, can I have a second chance? I'll think about it. I cannot believe you chose to use that photo. Hey, if there's water available, there's no need to scrub with sand. - Ugh. No one says that, okay? - I did it for you, okay? TOMORROW 9:00 MUSIC INDUSTRY AWARDS PRESENTATION Is that your secret "Mr. Loverman"? Shabba. Speaking of exploitation, how are you holding up with diva Dubai? It pays the bills, so now I can treat my sister again. - Know what energizes you when you're busy? - No? Penis. Didn't we just talk about this seconds ago? You don't listen to me. Fabian. Remember that guy? Think about him. He's hot. He's smart. - My photo made him horny. - He's available. He's probably on Second Love. Do it for me. Do it for Nadia. She's desperate to be a bridesmaid. Let me tell you one good reason why I'm not interested. Yes. This is where I should have told her, right here, that I was already dating Amin, set up by our own mother, but I said... I'm so done with love. Start walking, we're already late. Move it. - Go, move, move, move. - Shh! What "shh"? Look, all of them die in the end. Leyla. Leyla. You're incredibly stubborn, so I did this for you. Have fun, babes. - Amira, I will murder you! - Shh, be quiet. There's a movie playing. - Come here... - Shh! Sit down. I hate my family. Oh, sorry. - Sorry, I... - It's okay. - It's already over? - Yeah. Uh, was it, uh... was it good? Yeah, really good. But not as funny as the dream you had. I said something? You talked about a princess and... mmm, a meskina. Okay. Oh. Hey, wait. Down for a drink? I don't think that's, uh... I sat still for an hour and a half so you could sleep. Yallah. - Does your family set up all your dates? - These days, yes. - What a handy family. - Oh, they're handy, all right. And very loud. That isn't good? They're great, but if you don't feed them on time, you're gonna regret it. How about yours? My family is very reserved, I think. Donnie, Mikey, Ralph and Leo. Well, they're... hairy. My, uh, parents live in New York, so I only see them at Christmas. And the rest of my family lives in Belgium. A single man with four cats. Hmm. I associate that with someone who lives alone and believes in conspiracy theories. - And who says that I don't? - Crop circles. Well, luckily you're in between jobs so you can spend a lot of time with them. I'm not actually in between jobs. Because you're a secret agent? A terrorist? Oh, no. Are you an influencer? On those dating sites, 95% of people only look at what other people's jobs are. - Mmm. They're superficial. - Yeah. Most women melt as soon as they see you have an amazing job, travel all over the world and earn millions of dollars. Oh. Um, yeah, well... that's cool. That must be nice. If you hadn't come across my photo, would we be on this date right now? - Honestly? - Mm-hmm. I don't think so. That's what I thought. - Oh, wait. What are you doing? - I've got an early morning. - Thank you for your honesty. - Oh, no, no, no, you don't understand. - There was a book on your nightstand. - Excuse me? A book by Toni Morrison. It was in the background of your nurse photo. I wouldn't have known you read my favorite author if I hadn't seen that. Oh, my God. So sexy. My plan was to leave after five minutes, but the late summer night and his not-unattractive face were plotting against me. By the way, you have beautiful eyes. Seriously. Very, very, very, very beautiful. You are a charmer. A charmer? Kiss me then. Ah. PRESENTATION IN 30 MIN Fuck. Big problem, babes. Someone's not happy today, to the extent that "I'll strangle you with my bare hands." - Let me guess. - Leyla. What is this? I checked the presentation just like you asked. The spelling, Leyla. You replaced my plan with your ideas. Listen to me. I'd appreciate it if you don't tell me how to run my business. I'm not telling you how to write that book of yours. Perhaps I should because then you'd be finished by now. Ronnie Flex. Davina Michelle. Typhoon. Suzan and Freek. Josylvio. Douwe Bob. Kensington. Ilse DeLange. De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig. And, of course, Lil' Kleine. I'm truly convinced that with this great location that we found and all-star lineup, we can give this event the right allure. Thanks for your time. Yes, uh... Thank you. It sounds interesting. But I'm not sure if this is actually what we are looking for. An award show in a castle is a unique selling point. There are lots of rats in there, seriously. We'll have to think about it. There is a plan B. I, uh... I... This isn't the best time to share another plan. I have time for it. It's all right. Go on. Uh... It's a small idea. Um... Okay. You know, everyone loves artists. Um... But what are the artists without, uh, their fans, their family, their loved ones? What if we made an awards show about all these artists and the people who make them who they are? Artists would never be so successful without the people behind them. Let's put the spotlight on those people and celebrate who they are. We'll make this show for... for a big audience and not just a select few. What if we see a hard-core rapper receive an award from his neighbor, a person who helped him out every single day after school? Or if we had a singer sing a duet with her grandpa who's a surprisingly good singer? It'd be a show that everyone in the Netherlands can identify with. Sheesh, Leyla. Good stuff. Yes. Identify. With modifications, and a location without rats... ...we can make this happen, I think. Work it out and send me an e-mail. We will. Whoo! Game, set, bam, cuz. I swear, that's Super Saiyan shit. Did you see Malika's face when you mentioned the rapper's neighbor? Whollah, I thought she'd fart right there. - Malika doesn't fart. - Whollah, she does fart, I swear. Uh... I'm promoting you to producer. Clean this mess up first. Whoo! Ooh la la. Congratulations. How is it that you're still single? Can you keep a secret? If my mom and Amira find out I'm dating two men at once, I'm toast. Like the rapper? Figuratively toast. Mmm. But which of the two is better at, uh... - Better at what? - Just, uh, you know. Better at, you know... Oh, fuck. I'm not talking about that with you. Come on. Don't pretend to be a saint, huh. You shouldn't have to choose, anyway. My uncle in Morocco has three wives. Nobody makes a fuss about it, whollah. - Hey, you know what? - Huh? I'm keeping them both. What a scandal! Cheers, baby. So, sometimes I dated Prince Amin. Without his family. And sometimes I spent time with Prince Fabian. PRINCE AMIN WAS INCREDIBLY GALLANT AND SWEET BUT PRINCE FABIAN HAD JUST AS MUCH A HEART OF GOLD Ow! Sadly, this princess has to make a choice that's leaving her stressed. THE PRINCESS FELT GUILTY, BUT DIDN'T WANT TO BANISH EITHER FROM HER KINGDOM You're Fabian. And you're Amin. Fucking millennial. You don't have a go? But it would work with Ronnie's schedule, right? - Did you finish the plan, Leyla? - Give me two minutes. What do you think the chances are then? 7%? Yeah, okay. I'll think about it. I'll call you later. Okay. Hey, listen to this story. So, you know Nadine from the Middle East? - Yeah. - Last night, we were on a date. And you know what she said? - Mmm? - That I'm too vain. - I don't think I'm vain. Do you? - Mm-mm. Leyla, do you have the contracts for Studio Main Stage? - Talk to Sales. - Sales, dude. Thanks. Weirdo. Well, listen, I'm not vain, right? Huh? Far from it. Huh? I have a lunch date with Amin. A PRINCESS WHO CAN'T DECIDE OFTEN GETS INTO... - Hey, princess. - Hey, Am... Oh, fuck. Crazy news. Well, it looks like I'll be signing a huge deal in Qatar. Boring? - Are you okay? - Maybe, yeah. No. I'm sorry. There's an issue at work. Hold on a sec. - MEET AT THE USUAL PLACE? - ON MY WAY. SEE YOU IN A BIT! X Eh... Uh... Take a look at this and find something tasty. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Shh! Not so loud. - Hi. - Hey. - This is a good restaurant. - Yeah, good food. Yeah. Yeah, I usually sit at that table when I come here. Wanna switch? No. I'm waiting for my girlfriend. She loves to sit at that table. So does mine. What? - That's funny. - Great. - Yeah, she really is great. - And pretty. That too. Wow, yeah. - Very pretty. - Huh? - Um, my girlfriend, she's pretty. - Oh. Well, so is mine. - Speak of the devil. Hello? - Hey, sweetie... Are... A bad... ...signal. - Sorry, I can't hear you. - Outside. Yeah, I'll step outside. Hello? Leyla, can you hear me? I can't hear you. Leyla? Honey, I'm so sorry. I'm very busy at work. I'm so sorry, really. I can't take a break right now. Yeah, okay. - Wanna do something fun tomorrow instead? - The park, sure. Yeah. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yeah, it's fine. See you tomorrow. Are you okay? I couldn't find you. What are you doing? Looking for my purse. It's a short performance... come on, track, applause, whoo-hoo, and that's it. - Leyla, we need to talk about the artists. - One second. Let me call you later. Yeah. My dear Leyla, desperate times... call for desperate measures. You've been working on this for weeks, but you haven't even managed to book more than one artist. I had no other choice. - Let me guess. Malika didn't tell you. - No, she did not. Maybe working together won't be that bad. We used to work pretty good together. Oh, right. You mean before you decided to let your singer use your own mic. That time. Listen, Leyla, you're allowed to be angry. Well, thank you. That's super thoughtful of you... Abdelkarim, I'd like you to meet someone. What a stupid idea. Whollah, Malika was hit by the night donkey. - Which donkey? - Mm-mm. Work with your ex. How? You wouldn't ask Donald Trump to make couscous, man. I only see one solution. He has to back out of this project, and quickly. Fuck Abdelkarim. Without him, no artists. Without artists, no show. Devilish dilemmas, dude. Why don't you stop working? Fabian is rich beyond belief. No, I don't wanna feel trapped. - If you're not dating him, I will. - Yeah, or I will. Or I will. Seriously. I'd be able to chill. Fabian's super rich. - I'm serious. I'll call him. - Klaas would love that. Easy for you to say. You're still wearing rose-tinted glasses. Hey, before you get bored, you should date another guy. Oh, she's doing that. Argh. Leg day. That hamstring, right? Argh. Come on, honey. Chin up. - Yeah, man. You're a soldier, G. - Crush that scumbag, girl. Come on in. Hey. Hey. Wow. Oh, so tasteful. Wow. Mmm. The whole idea of the show is to go about it differently. We've just gone overboard with it. It's more like a circus than an awards show now. Martin Garrix is in. And Numidia. Mmm, okay, great. Um, if that's the case, then we'll have Numidia close the show. Know what's strange? This situation? When I look back at our marriage, I have no idea why it failed, but I remember how it started. We should've had this talk a year ago, not now. I don't see why we can't talk about it now. - Oh, you wanna talk about it? - Yeah. Fine. Let's do it. How's your fiancée doing? - And where is she actually? - She's on tour. - Guess what. I don't miss her. - Aw, miskin. Eh. How's your love life doing? Well, good. Really good. What does he do? He does, um, stuff. With real estate. Successful. Very rich. But, uh... Is he Mocro? Uh, yeah, duh. His father owns a Moroccan restaurant. Every Saturday, we watch his nephews play soccer. And they're incredibly attractive. Really hot. - Hot? What do you mean? - Uh, yeah, his nephews. They're hot? Uh, what do you mean, "hot"? Like, they burned your fingers? Listen... Leyla, you're everything I've ever wanted. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, whoo, um... You know, meeting you here wasn't such... - Um, it wasn't such a good idea. - Relax. - So I'll see... - What? - I-I-I'll see you... - What? - ...at the office tomorrow morning. - Hey, Leyla, come on. She has the hottest, richest man in Western Europe. But she decides it's better to work for a slave driver... Malika. And she's making next to nothing. Doesn't make sense. Klaas? Klaas. PIKE BOSS - 44 YEARS OLD DORDRECHT JORGEN VAN ZAND - 36 YEARS OLD HAARLEM GEORGIO 6 PACK - 29 YEARS OLD AMSTERDAM I know for sure you're gonna love Qatar. So, you'll work incredibly hard and I'll leave everything that I know. - For two years. - You'll have the time of your life there. With you. With who else? Let's just do it. A change of scenery. Excitement. Adventure. - Lots of sand. - But it's something totally different. And honestly, I don't know what's keeping us here. You can work on your book. It's a great opportunity for me and you. You've planned it out for me. Now all that's left for me to do is say yes. My nephews have been bouncing up and down for days since they heard they'll be attending the show as VIPs. You tell them they have to sleep. That's an order from Aunt Leyla and Ronnie Flex. - Sure, you got it. - Okay. Leyla. You know I'm very happy with you. You're pretty, you're smart. And funny. What's that? I think I'm ready for the next step. What do you mean, "next step"? Uh, Uncle Ali talked to your mother. About what? About us, our future. Couldn't you have discussed that with me first, Amin? - I just thought... - Yeah, you thought. That's right. You know what? - I don't want to talk about it. - Leyla, I want to tell you something. ♪ ...trapped life ♪ What are you doing here? I'm ending it with Klaas. What did he do? - Nothing. That's the whole problem. - What do you mean, "nothing"? I see you and your exciting and adventurous life with Fabian. Then I look at Klaas and I think, "Hey, man, I'm just not feeling it." - And Nadia and Noah? - "Mom's having a sleepover with Grandma." - Doesn't feel real, right? - It's happening. What I meant was I just can't believe that both of us are living with Maamaa again. I know. I miss Baabaa. So do I. So do I. When the music starts, I just want it to go like da, da, da, da. Looking for this? Oh, thank God. You still leave your phone on the toilet. Well, yeah, just a bad habit I have. Well, yeah. It's pretty disgusting. - We managed to pull it off. - Yep. It's gonna be really cool. I never thanked you, by the way, for everything you did for me. You already had a career before we got together. Yeah, but I only made it big when we were together. You even stopped writing your book. That had nothing to do with you. You sacrificed a lot to help my career. - It's time we put a spotlight on you. - What do you mean? Okay, sorry. This is the last time I'm hitting pause. But the man I was married to for four years asks me to present an award in front of a trillion people? Oh. Oh, no, no, no. - That'll never happen. - Oh, yeah. - Nope. No. - You deserve it. I'm not... I'm not doing it. I can't. Here, take it. Hey, I say it's perfect. I say fucking hell on earth. What's perfect? You mean my skin? In that case, thanks. Leyla's gonna present an award. - No way. - Sorry, I don't follow. For everything she's done for us. The Best Artist Award. - That's the last and most important one. - Yeah. It doesn't seem like Leyla wants to present at all. It's happening. You've made your point, thank you. ♪ Ah, ah, ah-ah ♪ ♪ Leyla, my queen, my zina ♪ ♪ I love her so much, I need her Ah, ah ♪ Aw, that's my song. What's the meaning of this? - Is it true? - Are you with that prick again? - Are you? - When did you start hooking up? It didn't mean anything. "It didn't mean anything"? Do you take me for a fool? What will Fabian think of this? Fabian? Who is Fabian? Fabian, Mother, is your son-in-law-to-be. Son-in-law? You mean Amin? Amin? Does Fabian have a Muslim name? Ali and I worked together and set Leyla up with Amin. Okay, but the Internet and I set Leyla up with Fabian. Oh, my God. What is all this? What's this nonsense about Fabian? Huh? I introduced you to someone from a good family, to marry and have kids. Maybe, you little liar, you should work less on that book of yours, and more on your own story. Shame on you. LEYLA AND ABDELKARIM BACK TOGETHER?! ABDELKARIM CAUGHT WITH HIS EX! WHAT A WHORE!! I DON'T GET WHAT YOU'RE DOING CALL ME LET ME KNOW IF YOU'RE OKAY YOU'RE JOKING FABIAN: I DON'T UNDERSTAND... FABIAN: WHO ARE YOU, REALLY? CLOSED OPEN Come in. Dude, you're making a mess. What? Hello. Why are you doing that? FABIAN: I'LL FORGIVE YOU IF YOU'LL GO TO QATAR WITH ME. FABIAN: SATURDAY, TERMINAL F. I really feel for him. Amin is a man. I think he'll get over it. The whole family is angry with us. They're always upset. Even if I breathe too loud, they get angry. If I sneeze, it's "Shame on you." Don't worry. Look. Shokran, Ali. Go back to work. I'm sure you're busy. - Yeah. - Shokran. I actually have nowhere I need to be. Have a seat. I'll cook for you tonight. - I don't need to sit. - Why? Will the world collapse? Sit down. Go on. Aha! Okay, tell me about your other daughter now. The music gala of the year: the Music Industry Awards. Tomorrow night, live. Who cares? Dear Leyla, thank you for sending in your wonderful manuscript. Unfortunately, I should start by informing you that we won't be publishing it as our editor-in-chief is, between you and me, a total asshole who is afraid to work with someone so controversial. He doesn't understand what this book could mean to a young girl growing up. This e-mail may mean nothing to you, but I did wanna tell you that you've moved me. I hope you won't give up and keep telling your story, no matter who wants to hear it. Yours truly, a little, lost princess. ♪ Friend, friend, friend Friend, friend, friend ♪ - Oh, fuck. - Rayan. Whoa. Hey, it's an important day for you, Captain. - Did you get ahold of Leyla? - She's not answering her phone. Switch to plan B. - No, but... - No arguing. Numidia, Snelle and Alicia X are seen as the front-runners - for the Music Industry Awards. - Shoot. Okay, time to go bed, you little runts. One more Princess Leyla story. Come on, please. Please, Auntie. - Be right there. - Yes! Mmm. Klaas. I wanna say thank you. Thank me for what? You're my sister, right? You're always welcome here. - Thank you. - Don't sweat it. And then the princess hopped on her powerful black horse and headed straight towards the horizon. The end. Come here, you. Come on. Time for bed now. Come on. Sleep well. - Aunt Leyla? - Yes, sweetie? Why is the princess always so unhappy? Why do you say that? She's in love, right? Shouldn't that make her happy? These are just pretty complicated times to be a princess. - How come? - How come? Um... Because, um, there are many people out there who are expecting a lot from her. And what would happen if there were no other people at all? Yeah. Then you still have yourself. But how does the princess turn into a queen? - What's that? - How does the princess become a queen? How does the princess become a queen? Klaas. I need you. Hmm? Chop-chop. - Where are we going? - The airport. Airport? You're not fleeing the country, are you? Klaas, I don't wanna pressure you. Okay, I'm the paramedic, that's right. PLEASE TAKE YOUR NEPHEWS TO THE AWARDS TONIGHT. TRUST ME. - Go, go, go, go. - Okay, okay. Hmm? Unbelievable!

I said, it's great that you found a babysitter. Fabian! Leyla. Where's your suitcase? You're not coming. Why are you here then? To tell you that you're... that you're truly amazing. Sweet, smart, sincere and so handsome that it's painful. And I'm here to say that I'm sorry. I was searching for... for something... and I... lost myself for a while. And you... you need to stay behind to find yourself. Well, um... a princess has to do what a princess has to do. Have a good trip, love. You too, Leyla. Ali? Yeah, I, uh... I-I came to see if you're having a better day today. I made harrira. Come in. Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome you to the Music Industry Awards. This is a brand-new concept. So we're going to have a party tonight! Are we ready to get started? No. Hey, we made it on time. Come on, let's go. Leyla, this is your chance to show who you are. And I understand that being there is your worst nightmare, but I know that... Everything will be fine? You know it. Come on. No, Evert, you shouldn't give me a hard time. - Do you know who I am, huh? - Hey, tone it down with Evert, huh? - Sorry. - Take it easy. Sorry, Evert. - I'm here. - Yo, what the fuck, tiger? - Where were you? - Hey. - At Klaas's. - We were worried sick about you. - You have no idea. - I'm sorry, guys. I'll make it up to you. I promise. - So when am I up? - You're not going up. What do you mean? We got someone else because we couldn't get ahold of you. Malika, I have to do this. - No, I don't think so. - Malika... You're not going to embarrass yourself and us again. End of discussion. All right, everyone. I'm having a great night so far. How about you? How great, how great! Louder, louder, louder, everyone! Tonight's first award will be presented by a very special, very sweet woman. Come on. Let's hear it for Khadija Hemria. Yeah, you know, that's my mom up there, man. - She looks good up there, man. - I love her. - Hi. Can I sit here? - Sure. Is that Rapper Sjors? - Good evening. - Hey. - My name is Khadija. - Khadija, man. Sjaak is my son. Sorry. I promised him I wouldn't cry. I'm incredibly proud to be here tonight to present the award for Best New Artist. - Fatima, look. Isn't that Amira's dishrag? - He looks like a dishrag. Klaas? What the... I'm Jeffrey Hartog and I'm a big fan of Gianni. That's why I'm extra proud to have the opportunity to present the award for Best Song tonight. I wanna thank Jeffrey because without fans, we're nobodies. And I gotta thank my main man Klaas. Daddy! Let's hear it one more time for Numidia! And now it's finally time for the last category this evening: the Best Artist award. Which will be presented by a very special person as well. A big applause for Miss Morocco! Miss Morocco! - Is this my Leyla? - She looks like her. - Oh, shit! - Aunt Leyla! Hello. Hello. I, uh... I'm not Miss Morocco. - Boo! - Definitely not. - Then why are you standing there? - Uh, yeah. Why am I up here again? I, uh... I will present the award for Best Artist. Uh, here we go. Come on. A-And the w-winner is... I STILL LOVE YOU X AP How does the princess become a queen? Tell them. Tell me. What do you see when you look at me? Hmm? A rejected woman? A home-wrecker? A gold digger? A whore? Because you're allowed to call a woman who doesn't do exactly what she's asked to do a whore, right? Don't worry. I'm not standing up here tonight to shame anyone. I'm not any better myself. It's what we're taught in the fairy tales we tell each other. The princess needs to be kissed right before she wakes up. The glass slipper needs to fit. She has to be home on time or her carriage turns into a pumpkin at midnight. Or... Or she can finally be with her Prince Charming by giving up her voice for two legs. That's what we're telling our daughters. That it's heroic for a princess to sacrifice her own voice if she wants to succeed in love. And we see this princess running, with no voice, her hair in the wind, crown on her head, with her Insta-perfect little face and then, bam. She's laying on the ground. This show is in honor of those who dare to pick us up in those moments when we're down. Even when we're flat on the ground and everyone's disgusted by us. But I've learned something important recently. I've learned that even if it's out of pure love, they will try to force us back into that perfect mold. And what do we do? We try to meet their wishes and expectations so desperately that we... that we stop hearing our own voice. Then we let go of the things that are most precious to us because we're always thinking about what we can get, and not what we already have. We hurt others. Often those who love us the most. We hide behind the walls we build ourselves because if no one sees what we're feeling, no one will ever get too close. And then, at the end of the line, what will we have achieved? Resounding applause because we're finally accepted? How long will we do that? How long will I keep doing that? Well, fuck that. I'm not pitiful. I don't need to be saved, or kissed before I wake up. I don't need your approval either. And I certainly don't need to be with someone just to feel whole. I am Leyla Idrissi. And that's more than enough. Yes! That's right! Yeah, man! Come on, applaud! Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Brava, brava, brava! That speech. She gets that from me. And that jawline, that's from me. And the award goes to... Alicia X. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Hey, sweetheart! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo! 6 MONTHS LATER You sure, bro? Yeah, right? It was on the invitation. Ah, fuck this damn outfit. I don't know, man. Last time, you screwed me over. Come on. You gotta let it go, man. All right, I'll follow you. Let's go. Nervous? A bit. A lot. - See you later, okay? - Okay. - Hey. Oh, hi. Wait, what are we doing? - Oh, hi. Sorry, I'll go... Yeah. You go that way. Oh, what a hot guy. That's what you're wearing? Shut your Botoxed face. I hope your schedule is free for a while. QUEEN LEYLA'S CRAZY FAIRY TALES 100% PRINCE-FREE COMING SOON EVERYWHERE You're going to make me so rich.
