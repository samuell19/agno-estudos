Who... Who are you? Angel's Egg Directed by: Mamoru Oshii Character Designs by: Yoshitaka Amano Screenplay by: Mamoru Oshii Keep precious things inside you or you will lose them. What do you think is inside that egg? I can't tell you things like that... Besides, I don't even know who you are. You have to break an egg if you want to know what's inside. Who are you?! Don't follow me! The fish have come out. Fish? Even though they aren't anywhere, they chase after them. Even though there aren't any fish anywhere. Please... My egg... Don't do anything to it... Promise. This way. I've seen a tree like this somewhere... When was it? So long ago that I've forgotten... Under a sky where the clouds made sounds as they moved. The black horizon swelled and from it grew a huge tree. It sucked the life from the ground... And its pulsing branches reached up, as if to grasp something... The giant bird sleeping within an egg. What happened to the bird? Where is it? He's still there, still dreaming. Dreaming? What kind of dream does the bird dream? What's in the egg? You still cannot tell me? Since when have you been here? As many days as there are bottles? I too have forgotten where I'm from... Maybe I didn't know from the beginning where I am going. Will you be going away? I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the ground, man and beast and creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them. I will send rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground. And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth. On that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened. And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights. The ark floated on the face of the waters, and all flesh died that moved upon the earth. Birds, cattle, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm upon the earth, and every man. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark. Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground. Then he waited another seven days, and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore. Where did the bird land? Or maybe it weakened and was swallowed by the waters... No one could know. So the people waited for her return, and waited and grew tired of waiting. They forgot they had released the bird, even forgot there was a bird and a world sunken under water. They forgot where they had come from, how long they had been there, and where they were going so long ago that the animals have turned to stone. It was so long ago, I can't even remember where or when I saw the bird. Perhaps it was a dream. Maybe you and I and the fish exist only in the memory of a person who is gone. Maybe no one really exists and it is only raining outside. Maybe the bird never existed at all. It exists. It's here. It's here. It's here. I found it, it's already turned to stone, it's in here. I'm going to hatch it and put it back. It's the bird I found. I know that. I thought so. Can you hear something? I can hear it. The sound of soft breathing. That's your breathing. I can hear the sound of wings. It must be dreaming of flying in the sky. That's just the sound of the wind outside. Very soon... Right now you're in here dreaming... but soon I will show you... very soon... So you must stay here now. It doesn't rain here... where it's warm... Who are you? Who are you? Who... Who are you?
