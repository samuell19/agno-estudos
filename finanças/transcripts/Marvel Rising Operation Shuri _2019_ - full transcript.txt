Walloping walnuts, America! Again? I got to make some upgrades to this thing so it can handle all your star-punching. It works out. We need a break anyway. Let's get some snacks. Did you have a good training session? Ooh, ooh, ooh, it's Captain Marvel! Remain calm, everybody. Remain calm. Hope I'm not interrupting anything, but I have an important mission that couldn't wait. Oh, yeah. Mission time! What villainy are we taking on this time, Captain? Well, there won't be any takedowns necessary. This mission is... Unique. Everyone, meet Shuri... Princess of Wakanda. Thank you. I've got it from here. Shuri is the lead innovator of Wakandan technology and is on a mission to share that tech with the world. Her brother, Black Panther, agrees with me that you could learn a lot from each other. Hey. I'm really excited to be here. Be sure to show Shuri what you guys do best. Now if you'll excuse me, I got space drama to deal with. - I'll see you in a few days. - Bye, Captain! Love you! I mean... yes, ma'am. Ugh. Did she just say "a few days"? You're Ms. Marvel, right? And you're Squirrel Girl, Ghost Spider, and America Chavez. I-I've done a bit of research. Wow. Uh, Your Majesty, this is... Please, you can call me just Shuri. Now that we're all introduced, when can we begin? Uh... I want to see your team in action. Imagine integrating Wakandan tech with your power sets. Oh, there's so many possibilities! We kind of only go out if there's an emergency. Yeah, otherwise we just, uh... Well... See, we train a lot. Oh. Snacks! Um, please excuse us. We need to get snacks right now f-for... for you. Uh, uh, hello? Ow! I'm confused. Our mission is to babysit her? More like befriend her. Am I right? Befriend her? I don't even know how to talk to her. What if there's an actual emergency? Is she gonna come and watch us? I can't handle a royal audience. Brother, I've made the journey safely, but the superheroes I'm with don't seem very active. Look, we can handle this. How? We get her some vegan doughnuts? What if she hates vegan doughnuts? We can't risk it until I do some research right now. Oh, oh, oh, I'll show Shuri my force-field tech. Just have to go finish it. Oh, uh, webs. My dad just texted me. He needs me to, uh, leave... right now. I got to go work upstairs. Come if you want. Your workspace is right above your secret headquarters? How convenient. A combustion engine. How fascinating. Don't touch that. Ooh, sorry. America, is that you? Who else would it be, Wilson? Very funny. You better not be working on that bike. I don't pay you to fix your own stuff. Your boss seems nice. Hmm. Odd. Hey! What are you doing? Just scanning your bike. You can fly, yet your bike cannot. I could help enhance it with some hover tech and... Look, some things don't need enhancing, like the cars that come in here... they're classics. My job isn't to change them. I restore them back to their former glory. They don't need to be anything other than what they are. America, who are you talking to? Hey, you want to let me get back to work or what? Ugh. I have restored your motorbike. In the two seconds I looked away? I've been working on that hydraulic clutch for weeks. I've had nightmares, and you just... Hey, America, don't forget to disassemble the '59's carburetor! I can do it. Remember, what we're about to face, it's relentless. It's overwhelming. It's a struggle just to survive. Whatever it is, I'm ready. Mm... Come on. We're gonna be late. Huh? I thought you said we were going somewhere dangerous. Oh, this is danger... aah! Let me help. The American high school you've seen in the movies? Yeah, it's not the same as the real deal. So far, it appears very similar. Well, maybe, but every day, you're testing your intellectual strengths. And if that weren't stressful enough, you're also navigating social cliques, just trying not to make a fool of yourself... aah! You should work on navigating around lockers, Kamala. Oh, Zoe, this is Princess Shuri of the Five Tribes of Wakanda. Hello. Youngest of King T'Chaka, second in line for the throne, chief engineer and innovator of... I know who she is. I don't live under a rock. Right, well, this is Zoe Zimmer of Jersey City, only child to Mr. and Mrs. Zimmer? She gets it, Kamala. Look, I don't know how this happened, but good luck showing around a princess. You're off to a great start. It's all right, Kamala. I've met other royalty that act just like her... lots of noise but little bite. She's not trying to bite you. We're late for class! One, two, three, four! I usually sit with Bruno, but he's out of town with family. What about over there? Oh, no, those are the drama kids. They'd yell Shakespeare at us until we left. - How about there? - Those are the jocks. Don't sit there unless you wanna hear about the quarterback's latest free throw or something. Then we will have to sit with Zoe Zimmer. What? No, uh, we can't. You do not need to fear Zoe, Kamala. She's just a person, the same as you. Totally. Yeah, I know. I feel the same way. What is she... no way! Are you kidding me? It was great to meet you too. You were right, Kamala. American high school is not like the movies. It's way better. Yeah, but you were also great... at everything. Is there anything you can't do, Shuri? I suppose... that. I've never tried that before. Whoo-hoo! - Come on, Kamala! - Coming. Yah! Kamala, are you okay? Hmm, let's see. Okay. Almost got it. Got what? Shuri! Wow. You're really... enthusiastic. It's not every day I get to hang out with a princess. And as a princess, I don't usually receive such... displays of affection. Oh, man, well, maybe we could... Hey! Aah, this is so cool! You're really here and I'm really here. Oh, I have so many questions. What's the power source for your wrist thingy? It's got a Vibranium conductor that... Is everything in Wakanda made of Vibranium? Well, it's a huge part of our culture, and I... Is there Vibranium in your shampoo? Your hair smells scientifically advanced! Uh... Did you bring any cool inventions with you, like a Vibranium-powered jet pack or... Actually, I'm supposed to be integrating Wakandan advancements with local tech, but I haven't really... Oh, oh, oh! Oh! I should show you something I've been working on! You know, maybe you could tell me what you think. Mm? Ah! Aw. Your animal friend is so cute! Yeah, she's great. Hey, check this out. I call it the Force-Bubble 9000. It's a force field that deploys upon impact so the wearer is safe and sound inside. How ingenious, Doreen. Wakanda has a very similar device for children. You know, so they don't hurt themselves from falling over. Oh, okay, it's... it's the same. You know what? I've got something better to show you. This is a facial recognition program I'm toying with. No big deal. Huh, impressive. Can it compensate for facial distortions? Aah, ooh, mm. Ha-ha, yeah, cool! Thanks for that. But, uh, I'm obviously still working on it. You know, I do have this other project I just finished. Okay, here we go. Don't panic. Ta-da! This is the top-of-the-line Secret Warriors combat training tech. This baby will knock the socks right off you. I'm not wearing socks. Well, then this baby's gonna put socks on you, then knock them off! Let's stand right here. I'll set it on easy so we can get our groove, and then... It's gone berserk! I'll save you, Shuri. Wait, let's just run over there... I've got to turn it off. You stay here. Oh, boy. This is gonna require... an action sequence! Let's get nuts. Hey. I'm not squirreling around! Oh! Doreen! I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm almost there. Hang on. Let me try. Ha! Wow! That was great! can we go another round? Huh? Look out! Whoa! Hi. Gwen? Hey, Shuri. Just give me a second. Sorry. I'm doing, like, a million things today. Were you out fighting crime? Oh, no. I had to do some errands in the city, and web swinging is just way faster than the bus. Oh. Has this been a slow week for you? Oh, I wish. Thank you for meeting me here. I couldn't move band practice again. We've got a big gig tomorrow, and I just... Band practice! That's awesome! Oh, thanks. I would never have time for something like this. I'm often too busy developing new inventions. Ooh. But you are also clearly busy. It's just anyone who would want to be in a band with me would have to be vetted by the Dora Milaje and... Right? My dad is a detective. He does, like, full background checks on my friends. Your dad does what now? Oh, hey, guys. Uh, this is Shuri. She's visiting from out of town, and... Whoa! You're... you're Shuri, as in Princess Shuri? Just Shuri's fine. Are you two doing a super team-up? Oh. Is it dangerous? Should we leave? No, no, no. it's not like that. Shuri's just visiting. We're off the clock. It's true. Please don't mind me. I'd love to watch your band practice. Seriously? Seriously. - Huh? - Okay, come on, guys. We have a new song, remember? We have to practice it. This is so cool. I'll just be over here. Well, all right. Here goes nothing. One, two, three, four! Oh, no! I missed my cue. Sorry. My bad. It's totally cool. You'll get it. Just listen for my snare. All right, let's take it from the top. I have, uh, one thought. Huh? The song sounds great, but I have a small suggestion. You see, there's a slight imbalance in your tonality... Hey, Shuri, uh, so this is a new song for us, and it's kind of a work in progress, and I don't really want to start messing with it until we have it down. Then we can add, like, flourishes and stuff, yeah? Uh... We should at least hear her out. Oh, okay. What you got? So your tonality is all mid-range. You need more highs and lows to balance out the percussion. And I think I have the perfect fix. Whoa. What is that? It's beautiful. The sound you're hearing is actually my hand disrupting an electrical current that is sent through the Vibranium in my bracelet. Oh, yeah, Vibranium. Of course. Can I try? Aww. It's harder than it looks. Yes. But with some practice... It yields wonderful results. Okay, we have got to put this in the song. Shuri, can you play with us? Okay, hold on. Wait a second. It is beautiful, but it is so different, you guys, it's gonna overwhelm the song. Gwen, no other band in town has a sound like this. We just hit the jackpot! We gotta use it! You could even go onstage with us tomorrow. I've never played in a band before. You'll do great. This is crazy. Now we know two musical superheroes! Okay, let's take it from the top. One, two, three, four! Brother, there you are! I haven't been able to help the Secret Warriors or integrate any Wakandan tech into the... But have you been able to hang out? All we've done is hang out, which I guess has been fun, but I don't see what that has to do with anything. Shuri sure is great, huh? Yep. Sure is. It's so annoying. - It is annoying! - Totally! Right? How is one person so perfect at everything? We need to do something. We gotta find a place to change, then, America, you and me gotta fix the tanker's hull, keep that ship afloat. Let's go, Secret Warriors. Wait, where's Shuri? She can take care of herself. Focus up. Come on! All right, nanites. Do your stuff. Yes! Crisis averted by... No! What? What? Oh, no. Look out! Coming through! And there you go. The last of the crew is safe. Let's get out of here. Wait, look! Whoa! Is that... nanotech? You don't think... Shuri must be on the ship. Hey there, chica. Secret Warriors to the rescue! One, two, three. Come on, let's go. Thank you. I'm sorry. It was a mistake for me to go into the ship alone. Are you kidding? If you didn't spring into action when you did, the oil spill would have caused serious damage. You did good, even if you needed help. It's true. You were so brave. And confident! And brilliant and... Oh, I wish I was more like you. But, Squirrel Girl, you're amazing. You're all amazing. You have your responsibilities as heroes, but you still have lives beyond that. It was nice to have that. Even if it was just for a few days. That's great to hear. This is what Black Panther and I wanted. Uh, uh, what? Shuri's royal heritage requires her to be... well, independent. But your brother wanted to make sure you didn't forget how to be a teenager. And I wanted all of you to learn to take pride in your abilities and be confident in yourselves like Shuri. You've proven yourselves heroes, ready to start taking on real missions. Yes! - What? - Yeah! That's us! Congratulations, Secret Warriors. Looks like our ride's here. Thank you again for this amazing trip. And please come visit Wakanda whenever you want. And you're welcome in our ranks anytime, Shuri. - Shuri sure is great, huh? - Yeah. Hmm. Hey, uh... where... where's Tippy? Tippy!
