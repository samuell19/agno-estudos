Ah, gee, we're getting our Christmas baby. We have a little girl. Neil, I'm sorry, birth weight's 560 grams-- 1 pound 4 ounces. A 1 pound 4 ounce baby? We've saved them smaller than that. Some are on these walls. Woman: This is a remarkable place. Your baby could not be in a better equipped hospital. I'm so scared, Neil. We're trying to stabilize her tonight. We'll take her into surgery sometime tomorrow. How? How can you? Are you trying to prolong life just to prove that you can do it? - You're way off base. - What kind of life is she gonna have, anyway? You're afraid she won't be perfect. Oh, come on, lay off. If it's not a perfect baby, you don't want it! ( sobs ) Oh, God. What chance does my baby have? ( theme music playing ) Ahh. It's not-- it's not, it's... No, it's out of line. It's kind of offbeat, it's... Yeah, it kind of has a life of its own. You know, you don't want just a flat apricot. It's a color. I've seen it. More of a full body bouquet. - What? What? - Shush. ( laughing ) It's-- it's those barns we saw camping out in Montana. - They were brown. - Sure, they're brown because it's the sky behind the barns, those apricot dawns! Apricot dawns behind the barns of Montana. I sing the melody. You sing the harmony. ( all laughing ) Honey, I know, it's like the flush on a virgin's cheek. Yeah, not the color of your cheeks. ( all laughing ) No, I can't listen to this. No, no more, please, I can't. Please, no. Do it, do it, do it, do it! ( classical music playing ) Look at this room. Our baby's gonna sleep in this room. Right, if we ever finish it. ( giggles ) Maybe we shouldn't. You know, kind of wait and see what it's personality is. One baby... coming up... awaiting personality. Uh, boy or girl? That's my little secret. It looks like a puppet. ( laughs ) A puppet, uh? ( chuckles ) Personality is just luck. Discipline is what counts. - You? - Get it cracking right out of the box. Okay, come on, let's see it. Practice. You're gonna be mush. There's a school, you know, that says that this is the time that they pick things up. Why do you think we're listening to Mozart? How did we do this? I don't know, lunch a couple of times. - Things got out of hand. - ( laughs ) The furniture is ordered, my job's taken care of. Lamaze classes start Friday. Oh, God, I always thought natural childbirth meant you didn't have to wear makeup. I'm not having any unskilled labor in there with me, buddy. I'll be there with my little whistle and my pillow. ( both laughing ) Oh, gee, we're getting a Christmas baby. You look so beautiful. Six months pregnant and I look beautiful? I look like a whale. ( giggles ) My beautiful whale. ( sighs ) That sigh was a ten. I'm gonna lose a major account if I don't come up with something by tomorrow morning. - Whose? - Centrex Corporation. We ran out of duck on a flight to Houston last week. Their senior vice president didn't get any. He said he's never gonna fly our airline again. You made that up. Ah, nope. I don't think so. Powerless in the grip of circumstances. Yes, but I take it as a personal challenge. Hang on, maternity leave is in seven weeks. ( groans ) - Are you doing that on purpose? - No. - You're hard as a brick. - Uh-huh. What is it? I don't know. - It's stopping, right? - Yeah. Well, what was all that about? - Premature contractions. - You think? It's nothing to worry about. He's a kicker. Wendy? Neil. Honey, you in there? Call Dr. Kenderly. ( siren wails ) A miscarriage. It's a miscarriage! How far along is she? She's at six months. This is Dr. Yoshi in Emergency. We have a lady and she's had a a sudden third trimester bleed. - Dr. Kenderly's patient? - Yes. Get her up to Labor and Delivery. ( beeping ) It moved. I felt it move. Baby's chugging along. What's happened? Is it painful here... to the touch? Tender. - Crampy? - A little. - Feel like contractions? - It did. - I think. - Now? No. Just a sudden gush of bleeding and the pains went away? - And the bleeding stopped? - Mm-hmm. We've got a category that we call third trimester bleeding. You're just going onto it. You're six months along. There are causes for this that don't necessarily mean there's going to be big trouble. If the bleeding stops, baby's fine, mom's fine, pregnancy continues. And that's what we're hoping. But you may be trying to have an abruption. Abruption? When the placenta separates from the uterus prematurely. Now we're going to observe you here in the labor and delivery area tonight until we're sure what's going on, until you stabilized. Either you'll get better and quit bleeding or we'll have to deliver you. What are the odds? I just can't give you any odds at this time. Let's hold on to good thoughts. I'm right here on the floor if you want me. ( beeping ) You two have something private going on? Well, you know, fathers and daughters... It's a girl. - No doubts? - No doubts. An apricot room and a pink baby. I feel I already know her. I do know her. Neil... Honey, nothing is gonna happen to this baby. Doctors always give you the worst case. It's a built-in mechanism. They can't help it. I'll take a leave from my job. It's two months early, but we have those CDs, we'll be all right. - Of course we will. - I'll call my mother. She'll come down. She'll help you run the house. I'll stay in bed. I won't do anything I'm not supposed to do. I won't read any upsetting romantic novels. I'll eat yogurt. Please, just one month, one more month. They make it sometimes if they get to seven months. Seven months, what are you talking about? We're gonna go the whole way with this. ( sighs ) I didn't even get a chance to wear that new maternity dress you bought. All the more reason. ( laughs ) Do not open until Christmas. ( both laughing ) ( alarm buzzing ) No. Notify county, - we need a transport team standing by. - What's going on? She's filling with blood. She can go into shock. We're gonna section. - Well, I want to be there. - I don't think that's wise. Well, I want to be with my wife. She's going to be under anesthetic. - It's going to be a difficult C. - Why can't I just-- I'll tell you exactly what's happened as soon as I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, everybody, let's go as fast as we can. How we doing? Scared. We're gonna relax you a little. Now, Wendy, what I'd like you to do is start counting down from ten, please. - Now? - Yes, please. Ten, nine... - eight... - That's good. - seven. - I think she's out. Okay, let's go. Woman on PA: Dr. Longmire. Dr. Longmire to surgery. We have a little girl. ( sirens wailing ) - Get it, Jack. - Here we go. Woman: We got to hurry. Man: Coming through. Excuse us. - Neil, I'm sorry. - Trouble? She was born with Apgar score of two, which is dreadful. She had no suck, no swallow, no gag, no reflexes, no muscle tone, no movement. Her heartbeat's ragged. Birth weight is 560 grams - Grams? - 1 pound, 4 ounces. 1 pound, 4 ounces. ( sighs ) Well, what can you do? ( sighs ) The immediate job is to protect the brain and nervous system, try to fight infection. We've sent her to County. They have facilities, can do things there we can't possibly. They'll evaluate her. She will probably not live very long. We should be grateful for catastrophes that didn't occur. Wendy's in no danger. She can have another child. She's going to be well. ( classical music playing ) ( music stops ) Miss? Mr. Scott? Hello, I'm Jean Gelson. I'm with social services. Let me help you with this. How's your wife? She's, uh... pretty beaten up. I understand. I know how you must feel coming to see a baby who's so sick. It has to be very upsetting. These children are so special. When I heard you were here, I was up on the fourth floor playing with a little girl who's about 4 years old. She came through this very unit four years ago. She was just here having her tonsils out and she was getting ready to go home today. She gave me the biggest hug. You get that sort of thing. This is a remarkable place. Some wonderful things happen here. Your baby could not be in a better equipped hospital. Could you excuse us, please? Thank you. Here she is. It's very difficult when you first see a preemie, especially when you have this Gerber thing in your mind and you come in here and see all these French-fry-warmer arrangements and all those wires and tubes. What's happening to her? Okay. She's under the blue lights because of the high bilirubin level in her blood cells and jaundice. She's getting fed a mixture of antibiotics directly through the umbilical opening to get a jump on infection if it develops. God. Why? Mr. Scott, I'm not gonna lie to you. She's on the edge. She has Hyaline membrane disease, respiratory distress syndrome. Lungs won't inflate on their own, She's too young. The only standard treatment is the use of the respirator, which has mixed success. But if that little lady gives us half a chance... What? A 1 pound, 4 ounce baby? We've saved them smaller than that. Some of them are on these walls. But my wife's obstetrician, I was told... He-- she has almost no chance. If that's what he said, if you're quoting him accurately, I'd have to say that man is living in the wrong century. He could very well respond to a month making rounds in this unit. The man does not know what can be done. I'm not going to tell you this isn't intense. We can't tell much till the first 12 hours are up. And if they get over that, they've got three, four days. Most of our babies who make it, make it in the first 48 hours. Once you get 48, 72 hours and you don't have a impending lethality you've got a real high chance of making it. We're talking 90% plus, okay? How can I help? I've got to get information. There's gonna be decisions. Mrs. Gelson is very good at pinpointing problems that mean a lot to you and your wife when she's well enough to visit or your family. We don't work in a vacuum. Coffee with her. Use her offices any time. That's what we're all about here. ( phone ringing ) Sign, please, both places. What am I signing? Assignment of insurance to hospital with agreement to pay anything not covered and consent to standard medical procedures. Standard procedures, meaning? Which may include but are not limited to laboratory, x-ray, medical and surgical treatment under general and special instructions of infant's physician or surgeon. I'll just read this. ( clears throat ) ( phone ringing ) It's not a very good picture. It's wonderful. I think she's wonderful. I called your mother. Honey, you're in a state of grace now. I can take care of that kind of thing. What did she say? They're praying. - We've got to name her. - All right. Katy? My grandmother's name. - Sure. - Katy Michele, you like it? Katy Michele. What she sound like? I didn't hear her. Oh, God, I'll do anything. I'll be a perfect person. I'll be perfect parent. Please, give me the chance. Man: You put those around the back. Why the hell didn't you call me? At 3:00 in the morning? Damn right, 3:00 in the morning. You know I'd have been down there. I know you would. I called Wendy's mother. What did she say? She wants to know what we did wrong. Oh, noble thinking, that really helps. You had a premature child. It happens. - Yeah. - How's Wendy? ( sighs ) They give you this photograph. It's a Polaroid but it's blurred. You can't see the wires and tubes. They have the baby patched into this kind of central mechanical mother, all pumps and compressors. You don't see any of that. I got to get that damn fan fixed. Oh, don't worry about it. Anyway, you have this photograph, and it's fuzzy because this guy's been taking pictures for years decides that it's nicer for the mother if he just jiggles his hand a little bit when it hits the shutter. So the idea she gets is that her baby's got fingernails and hair and this little pink face, crying out for her milk. How are you gonna deal with that one? I'm not dealing with anything much right now. Well, you've got the best. I hear what they can pull off... Well, that's another thing. I met her doctor and we don't connect. He makes you feel like you're nonexistent. Right. But he seems to think she's got a pretty good chance. Well, hell, yes. Listen, Dave... - for the next couple days-- - You get out of here. You go home and you get some sleep. Neil, I'm here. You know that. - Yeah. - Go on. Thanks. Dave: It'll turn out. We got guys to the moon. ( phone ringing ) Hello. Who? When? I'll be right there. Woman on PA: Dr. Brayer, 7283. Dr. Brayer, 7283. I'm here to see Dr. Nelman. My name is Neil Scott. - I'm Dr. Nelman. - What's happened? Come over here. - Thanks for coming in the middle of the night. - What's happened? Um, your baby almost went into failure during the night. ( sighs ) Why? Well, even with the respirator supplying a high percentage of oxygen, she can barely breathe. We had to boost the breathing rate because her blood gases were low, but the pressure from the respirator collapsed the lung. Oh, my God. We had to suction off the air that got between the chest and the lung in order to allow the lung to re-inflate. You're gonna see a new tube in her chest. I didn't want you to walk in there and not understand. Well, can't you take her off the respirator? No, her lungs are too immature. She couldn't possibly survive without it. Wait a minute, if you take my baby off the respirator, she can die, but if you leave her on, it can kill her. Well, sometimes it's a means of keeping an infant alive. But the procedure is a real assault on the baby's system. I have to tell you, there's a good chance it's gonna happen again. We were... We were given every indication that... if we get past the first 48 hours... In two years of working in Neonatal Intensive Care, I don't remember ever seeing a baby with lungs so poor. I'm surprised that wasn't conveyed to you. My wife... You have a desperately sick baby, Mr. Scott. Come on, sugar, just another half CC. ( sighs ) I don't know if we're gonna get this. The needle's larger than her vein. Let's finish this later. Does baby girl Scott have a name yet? Katy Michele. I'll go have a name tag made. ( dramatic music playing ) ( tires screech and horn honks ) - Are you blind? - I'm sorry. You could have killed somebody. I wasn't paying attention. I'm sorry. Well, if you can't pay attention get away from the wheel. - My mind was... - You know, this is just what we need, another stupid driver. Get out and say that. Come on, you want to have it out? - Let's do it right here. - ( tires squealing ) Come on, get out here! What's the matter with you? Come on back, God damn it! ( crying ) Oh, God. Do you want to take David and Robin's flowers? - Uh, there too far gone. - Yep. Why can't we just go? We have to wait for someone to take you. My milk. - Hi. - Here we go. - Okay? - Yeah. Okay, when you get there just give it to one of the nurses. - Got it? - Yeah. How do get a license to drive one of these things? ( chuckles ) You got to join the staff. I think I already have. - Okay? - Jennie? - Yeah? - Thanks. It's gonna be fine, Mrs. Scott. - Good-bye, Jennie. - Good luck, Mr. Scott. ( baby cooing ) ( elevator bell rings ) Man: I'll get it, honey. ( baby crying ) People just don't know what to say yet. They don't know what to send. I don't care. Let's go. Honey, this isn't gonna be what you think it is. I just want to see her. Come on, let's go. Woman on PA: Mrs. Gelson in ICU. Mrs. Gelson in ICU. Mrs. Gelson: Good morning, Mr. Scott. Mrs. Scott. - Hello, I'm Jean, Jean Gelson. - How do you do? Excuse me, I just need to put on a gown, too. Did you just come over from the hospital? - Yes. - Well, I think that's wonderful. You know, interaction between parent and child is something we just can't provide. To be able to interact with her and be a family member... - Can I see her? - Sure. This way. Cathy, I'd like you to meet Mr. and Mrs. Scott. - Yes, we've already met. - Good morning. Hello, it's nice to meet you. - Come to see our little fighter. - Oh, yeah. These nurses, all the personnel at this hospital, are terrific. Oh, I brought this. It's--well, you know-- We'll take very good care of it. We encourage our mothers to bring in their milk. It supports the bonding process. - Where is she? - She's right down here. Here's a little fellow, weighed 2 1/2 pounds when he was born, not much more than yours. He goes home next week. I want to see mine. It's important that you realize the physiological effect that you have on your newborn. That's not often thought of. Most people they tend to think of their baby as not really being functional until it reaches term - and that's-- - Look, can we just do this later? I just want to see my baby. You must understand, Mrs. Scott, - one's first view of their baby-- - Please. Sure. ( dramatic music playing ) Oh, my God. Oh, God. ( crying ) I understand what you're feeling. What are they doing to her? I want to talk to the doctors. - I don't think that's a good idea. - Now! I want to see them right now. ( moaning ) Man: I'm sorry we're late. Dr. Radburn, I think you've met. How are you, doctor? Mr. Scott, good to see you again. - And this is Mrs. Scott. - Mrs. Scott. - And Dr. Nelman. - Hi, this is my wife, Wendy. - It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Scott. - Just be comfortable. Please be seated. How are you feeling? Rough morning? Well, let me tell you something, mother. A premature baby is the hardest thing to love instantaneously. And every mother has the fear of being judged, condemned, which is totally misplaced, though understandable. Okay? I understand you have some questions. Neil: I'm not ungrateful and I'm not trying to put problems in your way. We don't stand on ceremony here. I'm afraid for our baby. I'm afraid for us. I just want to know what's happening? All I'm getting is contradictions. Radburn: Your baby is critically ill. I've never said anything else. She's way below birth weight and still at high oxygen setting. Neil: But you said it with an inference - that you were hopeful. - We're always hopeful. Well, that's not what I get from Dr. Nelman. What's he alluding to? The pneumothorax. Oh, that was a misreading. You mean he's wrong? She doesn't have the worst lungs he's seen here in the last two years? - What is it you're asking? - I just want the truth. I want to know what her chances are. Is there gonna be more damage? I know she's on 100% oxygen. I read what that can do to lungs like hers. Where did you get that figure? It can almost destroy her. It did almost destroy her. She's got blood gasses of 7.2. Below that, life is impossible. Who's giving him those figures? It's on her chart! And I did some research on my own. We'll call you if there's something to worry about. Something we think you should know. Please... I just want to know what's going on with our baby. Is she beyond all this stuff and we're not being told? What is your profession, Mr. Scott? I wouldn't attempt to tell you anything about your business. I wouldn't be qualified. You're not telling us anything about anything! Why?! Are you trying to prolong life just to prove that you can do it?! - Wendy: Neil. - You're way off base. What kind of life is she gonna have anyway? Wendy: Neil! Look, he hasn't given us one straight answer. ( sighs ) Where are you? Nowhere. Right here... thinking. About what? Never mind. Okay. You certainly asked them enough questions. Look, if we could just relax a little. Don't talk to me like that. Don't talk to me like you talked to them. - Who? - The doctors. Nothing but questions and criticism. You think that's what I was doing? Why did you ask him if there was going to be damage? - That's a terrible thing-- - It was a mistake. - I never should have. - Why not? - It's what you wanted. - I wanted the truth. - Someone had to say something. - He did. He told you. - What? - You heard him. I know what Dr. Kenderly said. He denied it. I know what Dr. Nelman said. He won't admit it. You sounded like you were blaming him. What more was he supposed to say? I'm not blaming anyone. This wasn't anyone's fault. I know that. You don't believe that. You say it, but you don't believe it. I'm not even talking about blame. Blame? I don't want to hear this. All I meant is, what the hell are we in for? I know what you meant. You're afraid she won't be perfect. Oh, come on, I'm not afraid of any such thing. That there will be something wrong, that she won't go to Harvard and be a Homecoming Queen. Oh, come on, lay off. If it's not a perfect baby you don't want it! Okay, you're right. I am afraid. There, you see?! I'm afraid that I'll start to love her and then she'll be gone. Don't then. Wendy. Wendy. Don't hate me, please. Hate you? I'm sorry. How could I hate you? Why me? Why our baby? I should be sitting here with her inside me. She's our child. We're her parents. It doesn't feel like my child. - I've never even held her. - Come here. I'm so scared, Neil. I ran from her. I ran from my own baby. We're both scared. But we haven't done anything wrong. There's no judgment. There's no blame. Whatever happens. ( horn honks ) Wendy: No, mom, I don't think it'd be a good idea for you to come down right now. Well, for one thing, there's not much you can do. Maybe in a couple of months when she's home from the... No, I don't think our moving when I was three months along had anything to do with it. I mean the... I don't believe this. I'm 32 years old and my mother is still trying to tell me how to run my life. - ( horn hon ) s - Look, I've got to go. There's somebody here for me. Yeah. Yes, I do, too. Yes, tell him I do, too. Okay, bye. Are you okay? My mother. What does that mean? I was her only baby and she always wanted to have another. ( gurgles ) Oh no, I don't mean that. That's not fair. Does it matter? Yeah, everything seems to at the moment. I can't explain it. I went after Neil last night. Welcome to marriage. Well, we don't do that to each other. Oh? Everybody else does. I spent my entire pregnancy thinking of a thousand and one horrible things that could happen. We all do, come on. But when it did, I could believe it. I can't believe it. Am I being punished for something? Should Neil and I have stopped making love? Am I too high strung... like that? I didn't even think David and I should travel when I was pregnant. Everybody's got those thoughts. - ( sneezes ) - Whoops. God bless you. I think you're gonna be a great mother. Your baby is gonna be fine. How do you know? - With an apricot nursery-- - The nursery doesn't matter. Oh, come on, who could pass up a start like that? ( laughs ) Oh, ow. Listen, come over tonight. Okay, you haven't even been out of the house since the baby was born. No party, no big deal, just stop over. Wear your jogging clothes. You know, we'll send out for some ribs. Maybe I'll call Terry. Terry? Yeah, she's had this huge fight with her new boyfriend. She didn't tell you? Terry would be great. Good. Okay, so I'll pick you up right here at 10:45. Yeah. Hey... Thanks. See you later. - Say bye to Wendy. - Bye. Boy: But why does she have to go into the hospital? She's gonna see her baby, honey. Wendy: Let's go home. You're kidding. It's the questions. I just don't feel like talking. Honey, It's David and Robin. And Terry, your best friend, Terry. Who the hell do you think is gonna ask questions? Yep. Come on. Okay. Okay, everybody, dig in. It's no good tomorrow. - Ooh. - Take-out, huh? How does she do it? Well, you get to the frozen food section before it closes. - Drinks, anybody, Neil? - I'm fine. - Wendy? - I'll have some juice later. We need to get her off this hard stuff. ( thump, baby cries ) Oh, sweetie. Are you okay? Did you bump your head? Did you bump your head? Let me see. Let me see. Rub it. Isn't it great with kids? All you have to do is kiss it to make it well. I think I'll get that juice. I'm so sorry. I didn't even hear it. I'm sorry about you and Hal. Why do I always go for guys like that? Well, at least I'm through with him. And you got the next one picked out. No, but I'm sure there'll be a next one. I mean, why lie to myself? And why lie to you? I don't think I ever have. I didn't even hear it. That's not what I'm talking about. We both know it. I didn't know what to say. That's why I never called or came down to the hospital. I'm... just so ashamed. - It's okay. - No. It's not. ( sighs ) It must have been a terrible hurt and I just... What do you say? Congratulations? Or do you say I'm sorry or send flowers? Wendy, what are you hoping for? - I had a baby. - I know. She's a person, She's just a little person. I want to hold her. I want to nurse her. I sit there in the hospital waiting for life to happen. What do you mean, what am I hoping? ( dishes clanging ) You did good, kid. Well, we got through it. I'll say we did. Let's finish painting the nursery. Yeah, we never got around to that. Do you like that color? ( phone rings ) It's my sweater. I left it there. Tell Robin just to hold on to it and I'll pick it up later. Hello. Yeah. Okay, thanks. Wendy... they've been trying to get hold of us. They want us down there right away. This is a CAT scan of a baby's normal brain. These are the ventricles, little spaces in the brain where we make spinal fluid. This is your baby. What happened? The capillaries which carry the blood are very tiny in a baby this small. Sometimes, especially when there's a sudden change in blood pressure, they can burst. Blood seeps into the ventricles causing what we call an IVH, Intraventricular hemorrhage. Now we categorize these bleeds by grade, one through four. One being the least severe. So what's this one? It's a grade four. Oh, God. How? We think it has to do with the way the baby responds to the respirator. Damn, that respirator again. What appears to be happening is that the baby is trying to breathe on its own while the respirator's trying to breathe for it, breathing out of synchrony may bring on the bleed. What can you do? Well, we insert a thin tube called a shunt into the side of the head through the brain and into the ventricle. Now the other end of the stunt is passed beneath the skin into the abdominal cavity allowing the excess fluids to drain. For how long? Well, generally the shunt is lengthened every two years to keep up with the growth of the child. Surgery every two years? For life? Well, some small number do outgrow it. But most do remain shunt dependent. What if you don't do it? That's not a consideration. She couldn't survive. Well, can she survive with it? Has there been damage? Will this mean there's gonna be more? Why don't we talk about that when we see where we are? Right now, it's just not a relevant question. For who? This is not your baby. This is our baby. I want to know where this is going. I'm sure Dr. Radburn would be glad to discuss it with you. - I want to talk to Dr. Nelman. - He's been circulated. - What does that mean? - Assigned to another section. - Well, which one? - I really don't know. Perhaps the switchboard can help you in the morning. Woman on PA: Dr. Philips, 8265. We're trying to stabilize her tonight. We'll take her into surgery sometime tomorrow. How? How can you? Surgery? Anesthesia, how can she survive that? We won't be using anesthesia. What did you say? Well, beyond a local, there's just too much danger. What about the pain? Their memory isn't formed yet. They have no memory of pain. No memory of pain? I want to talk to Dr. Radburn. He'll be on rounds most of the morning. Before any surgery, I want to see him. Woman on PA: Dr. Philips, 8265, stat. Of course. What do you mean, you can't reach Dr. Nelman? He's a doctor, doesn't he have a beeper or something? Look, we have a child in your hospital. She's been his patient. This is important. Well, who is on call? Dr. who? We don't even know him. - I know what to do. - At noon? All right. - Neil! - All right. I see. No, no. No message, thanks, no. - What? - Kenderly. Let's go back to Kenderly. Intraventricular hemorrhage. What grade? Did they tell you? Four. Grade four IVH and a collapsed lung? Yes. How can I help? Well, you try to communicate with these people, but they don't listen, all you get is contradictions. You ask for a prognosis, they don't even acknowledge the question. You want to know whether or not to let her go? No. I know how much you wanted this baby, how much you planned on it, how much you want it still. 15 years ago we deliver a two-, two-and-a-half-pound preemie, immature lungs, under developed physiology. We played God. No, we let God play God. Kept the baby warm, gave it nutrition, hydration, everything short of assisted ventilation. We let nature decide whether or not it was supposed to live. Usually, mercifully, it didn't. There was grief. It ended. The parents often went on to have another baby. They'd been spared the agony of a long, slow, horribly torturous death, or being with the lifelong sadness of a deformed or badly damaged child. And it is sorrow. I don't care what you're told or what you've heard. It is, in my opinion, a deep embittering stressful sadness. Ultimately, modern technical medicine changed all that. It became God. And it decided if there was a heartbeat, an impulse, a cranial activity then the child was to be preserved no matter the consequences to the parents or the children. And in may cases with the 2 and 3 pounders, their work is genius. They do save babies that would not have lived before. But below that, at the weight of your child, below 2 pounds, they don't answer your questions because they don't know the answers. So one has to ask... is it medicine or is it experimentation? There's a time to let some of these children die. ( horn honks ) ( sobbing ) Okay. Okay. She's had an IVH and we're worrying. We're worrying about her lungs. But we don't think we can wait. We're doing the shunt this afternoon. Are there any gains, just one sign that she might improve? A response to touch... a-a voice, anything? Just one thing to justify this torture she's going through. She can die or survive with brain damage or other handicaps. There are no lab tests or printouts that read beyond all shadow of a doubt. We don't want you to. I'm sorry? No more heroic measures. These are not heroic measures. They're standard procedures. I know how hard you've worked. We appreciate it. We both do. Sincerely. But we don't want any surgery. The admissions papers you signed already contain a consent form. Well, we rescind it. It is very obvious to me that we have to do everything in our power and not let anyone stand in the way of doing the best we can for this child. Even if it means getting a court order. ( sighs ) Neil: Where are we in all of this? I mean, who are the parents anyway? You must be going through hell. Can you stop them? That's the question. No, I'm afraid it isn't. I can't imagine anything more painful or devastating than what you're suffering, or being made to suffer. Right now you're in a private hell. Do you want a public one? How? Are you prepared to argue publicly that you want your child to die? Because that's what you're gonna have to do. Why does it have to be public? - I can handle that side. - Oh, no, no, no. You're not the one they're gonna go after. You've seen what the media does with cases like this. You're gonna be fair game, Mrs. Scott. And my opponent's gonna come into that courtroom and take every advantage of it. He'll say, it's unnatural not to want your baby. It goes against everything we know about the instinct of mothering. And he'll ask you, are you telling this court you want these doctors to kill your baby, Mrs. Scott? What kind of a woman would want such a thing? That's what you're gonna hear if you go to litigation. You're gonna be on the front page of the paper and every night on the 6:00 news. You're gonna have microphones thrust in your face every time you open your front door. - Can you handle that? - Neil. Now hold on just a minute. - We're not going to do this. - I said, just a minute. You're hardly able to deal with this between yourselves. How are you going to deal with family and friends? Why didn't you just finish it? - Finish what? - What you started up there. I started? What the hell did I start? Going to court. I hate it. We can talk, can't we? We can explore our options, express an opinion. - Does that include me? - Let me tell you something, I don't care if this does make the front page. - It's the only way that we're gonna-- - This? What is this?! This is our child! I didn't put it that way. It doesn't mean anything to you, those things he said up there. - You can't just give up! - I'm not giving up! He said we couldn't do it! He never said that! He said it would be difficult! Lawyer? You're gonna hire a lawyer? I want to stop them. I want to make them let her go. Our baby's dying, Dave. Well, when did they tell you this? They didn't. They don't tell you anything. They just keep on going. Her lungs are dying. Her brain is dying. - And they just go on. - Listen, listen. You've both been wound tight as hell over this. I think you ought to take off for a couple weeks. I can't, we can't do that. My God, Wendy's still pumping her milk and taking it to them. They freeze it. They've got a whole freezer full of milk that the baby's never gonna use. And you want to hire a lawyer? Your wife's giving milk and you want to pull the plug on your own kid? By God, Neil, how the hell could I do that to one of mine? She's not like one of yours. She's alive. What kind of life? You can't make that judgment, you're not God. Oh, don't get me started on God. You can't just kill a kid just because you didn't get what you wanted. She's entitled to a life, whatever it is. Oh, hell, Neil. You know sometimes, it's a crazy world. You get a little dirt on the window, you can't see the full picture. It's the doctors who can't see the full picture. They only know what happens in their world, in their laboratory. It's our child! And they think we have nothing to say about what happens to her. I've never felt so out of control in my whole life. Got to fight them, David. Well, great, why don't you do it? You just make sure that it ruins your half of the business when it makes it news and not mine. Business, what are you talking about? Is that all you care about? The only reason why you give a damn is the business? Neil, Neil, listen to me. And you can go to hell! We're not taking the same train on this one. Good morning. Morning. Wendy: Somebody's going home. Yes. Must be wonderful. Sometimes. It can be, yes. If I were her. Mrs. Scott, I'm sorry, you'll need an orange gown. Why orange? They've operated on her. This way, Mrs. Scott. Woman on PA: Dr. Kaiser call the page operator. Dr. Kaiser, call the page operator. She's fighting. She's not fighting. You're fighting. The machines are fighting. Things growing pretty strained... at home? Yes. Friends? Terry, she promised to come and see the baby. - She didn't? - No. She's not pulling away from you. She doesn't know what to say, how to deal with it. She's scared. This frightens her. I'm not worrying about it. Who's worrying about you? This is very difficult to get through alone. There are some people that I'd like you to meet. What people? Parents, like yourself, they get together once in a while. - And do what? - Talk. Yeah, I know. It's like a sack full of garbage, you open it up, it all falls out. They're getting together this Friday afternoon. - I could give you the address. - No thanks. I'm late. I have to go. Friday afternoon. ( phone ringing ) - When does Blyer turn up for his trucks? - Thursday. - Let's call him. - Don't worry. I'm not worrying about it. Let's just take care of it, all right? Shipping. This is Neil. Mr. Scott, this is Mr. Taverner from County Hospital. We'd like you to come in as soon as it's convenient. It's a matter of your account. What do you mean, insurance? My wife has insurance. We both have insurance. Your wife has insurance. She doesn't have coverage. Yes, she does. There's a pamphlet right here. ( phone ringing ) Here's the benefit schedule. - Taverner. - Maternity, 16. Yeah, let me call you back in a minute. All covered expenses incurred as a result of pregnancy and resulting childbirth, including complications arising therefrom. There it is. Your wife works at Trans-Universal Airlines? Sales, She's a sales representative. She was a stewardess at Palm West for seven years and then she went to Trans-Universal. Five and a half months ago. Five? Yeah, five. At which time she was already pregnant. Yes, I guess so. There's an exclusionary clause in her policy, Mr. Scott. There's no coverage for any medical indisposition at the time of employment. But, the maternity bill at City Hospital, they paid for that. Your policy paid for Mrs. Scott's maternity. But I have the same clause in mine. With comprehensive medical benefits not to exceed $20,000. So what's the problem? This is the problem. $71,000? Your child has required a number of procedures. It's been less than two weeks. $71,000? She wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for the extraordinary facilities available here. But how am I gonna pay this? I don't have that kind of money. The bill has to be satisfied, Mr. Scott, one way or another. ( hammering ) All this stuff is good for is fire wood. I should have done this months ago. What's happened? They've done the surgery. When? I don't know. Yesterday, last night. Well. Neil? Don't rush me into anymore feelings. They just aren't there. Damn them for this. You know? Damn all of it. - No, never. - Never is a deep pit. What does that mean? I was called down to the hospital business office today. It turns out our insurance has run out. They want $71,000 from us, and it's climbing. I wish she'd been born dead. Not now, Neil. God, please, don't fall apart on me now. I need you. What for? I can't even help my own child. - Our child! - She's not our child. She's theirs! - Stop it! - You tell them to stop it. You never tell them a God damn thing! You just sit there, crying. - I can't help my crying. - I hate your crying. It makes me feel like I'm supposed to do something. I feel like I'm failing you. I have failed! I love you, Neil. I love our baby. I need you to love us both. Woman: Well, you know, she's still on home hyperalimentation, Iv solutions at night. and we're fighting organ damage which is rough. How are you managing with the tray? Well, compared to other things we've seen, we'll take that any time. No problem. I always say on my bad days, I always say I know what Janet would say, All: No problem. ( laughing ) Excuse me. No problem. So how's your baby? He's doing very well cognitively. He's just very impaired motor wise. We're working on it, but it is driving us crazy. Cheese? Hi. You want some more wine? Sure. Just don't look at the label. ( laughing ) That bothers you doesn't it? How can they laugh like that? They couldn't with anybody else. Well, their babies are alive. And yours is dying. You're afraid she'll die. And you're afraid she won't. Afraid to want her to die and yet you think that's what's best. And you think back over those thoughts and you think those are not the feelings of a mother. How can I be having those feelings? What kind of person am I? Thinking about letting your own child die? We have all gone through those feelings. I'd rather not talk about this. But that's what you're thinking, isn't it? I don't know the right thing to do. I don't even know the right thing to want to do. Easier to back away and leave it up to the doctors. And you're clean. You're off the hook morally. But your child is still suffering. But how can you go to the doctors and tell them what to do? Who better? Who else is gonna go the whole route? But you just can't do that. Can you? I have a little boy. He's 8 years old. He was a 32-week preemie. He had a grade three IVH when he was on 70% oxygen. And they put in a shunt. He had heart stoppage. They put a wire into his heart. And uh... I felt that the torture and the invasion that was going on with my baby had to stop. Only I didn't feel entitled to say that. I had very bad feelings about myself when I even thought that. Today he's certifiably blind. He has the mental development of a 2-year-old. When I first took him into the hospital to have the shunt replaced at 2 years old, the nurses all said, "oh, isn't he cute?" And today when I take him in, when he starts to go crazy, 'cause I know that he knows where he's going. They don't think he's so cute anymore. They think he's a pain in the ass. What happens to him when he's 20? Or when he's 40 if I'm not here? My husband and I haven't slept together since we brought our son home. My husband sleeps in another room with him every night because he wakes up with seizures. You know, did they think of that when they saved his life? Or did they do it just because they could? I've lived with what you're going through. And they talked me out of trying to stop it. Actually, they didn't need to talk me out of it. My guilt talked me out of it. And I've been paying with guilt ever since. ( knock on door ) I was hoping you'd still be here. What chance does my baby have? Statically with a grade four IVH, chances are very high that she will end up with multiple devastations. Multiple? Mental retardation, Hydrocephalus, seizures, cerebral palsy, blindness. What about her lungs? That complicates things further. Not much chance for anything? No. I want her taken off the respirator. I want it all stopped. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to make them do it. Neither do I. ( sighs ) But I'm gonna help you try. - Would you? - I think you're right. I think they've done as much as they can. What can I do? We could ask for a meeting of the ethics committee. Ethics, what's that? It's an infant care review hearing. It's called if the parents and doctors can't agree on therapy or care. As a member, I can call it for you. When? - Two or three days? - What happens? Dr. Radburn will argue his position. I will present yours. No, I'll present mine. Every hospital has its own rules and procedures. At this hospital, parents they don't attend. Because it's thought that the committee members would not be able to speak openly, truthfully. They don't even want to know the parents. They think it's better if they don't. I can't be there? I agree with you. I don't think it's proper. You could try. - You could ask. - Who? The standing chairman is Dr. Radburn. ( sighs ) Emergency trachea will keep him going. I'll get a neurologist down here stat. I want you to stand by, keep the air passage clear. Wendy: Dr. Radburn? Mrs. Scott. - You want to come to the hearing? - Yes. Be here Wednesday morning, 9:00. I'll have somebody take you down. What time is it? It's pretty late. Aren't you cold? A little. Well, come on to bed. In a minute. I need you there tomorrow. I can't. We have a big shipment going out. It's got to get done. Dave can't do it alone. Please. What's the point? They aren't gonna listen to a word you have to say. Behind those doors you do the best you can with what you've got. It is not our job to keep long-term custodial facilities full. It's our job to prevent it. I did not get into this business to play God, to decide who's going to get treatment and who's not. Our job is to do the best we can to achieve the best outcome. Now in some situations that may mean a vegetated outcome, but that is still our job. And I am never going to be in a position of taking the baby's only chance unless the outcome is so dismal that there is none, no hope. It is my feeling that parents have a right and an obligation to support that effort as much as I do. And I think most of society agrees with me that parents do not have the right to withhold therapy, appropriate, logical, sensible therapy that sensible men might agree upon any more than I do. You don't go into a pregnancy, unless you want your baby. This is a time when you ought to be in there covering us with your support, stumbling all over yourselves to work with us. But some parents, however, even those tenuous links that you hope to establish haven't tied in. They're reacting to anxiety and stress in a way that is not the same for everybody else. I can respect that. But when we are in there, with your baby, fighting to preserve its life, I have no concern with that kind of thinking, none, zero. We have preceded 29 days into therapy with this baby. We have gathered the opinions of specialists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, neonatal intensive care specialists. We have performed various x-rays and studies and have come to the conclusion that at the moment we are indeed in very serious trouble with this baby. At the moment. There are children attending the schools of this city that have been at that moment themselves. This child... is entitled... to our continuing every effort to ensure its chance for that life. Mrs. Scott. Mrs. Scott. ( clears throat ) You don't go into a pregnancy unless you want your baby, is that what you said? I believe that's what I said. What do you know about us as parents? Have you ever asked one question? Do you know who we are? How much we planned for and wanted a child? How much we looked forward to one? You don't know anything about us. You don't want to know. We're just good parents or bad parents. Good if we follow you blindly, bad if we don't. You say there are children in school today who've been where my child is now. How many? One in 20? One in a hundred? What about the others? You never say. You only show us wonderful, wonderful pictures on the wall. Where are the ones who aren't so wonderful? How often are parents told of the damage that can be done if their babies are put on the respirator? Um, brain bleeds, blindness, lungs blown out, irrevocable damage, all because of the respirator. Maybe, in three of four months you can hand us a child to take home. But in two years or six or ten, where are you? And the family is bankrupt and often destroyed. Where will all you wonderful, caring... people be then? You use statistics to say what you want us to hear. But you can not admit that what you're often doing is medical experimentation, not therapy. Because you really don't know what works. I think it's medical torture. And why don't I have a choice whether or not I want my child, she's my child, to go through that? Just tell me something, do you think my little girl wants to be in that pained, tortured... tiny body? I don't think so. Would you want anybody you loved to be suffering inside that body? Please... let her go. Pete: Wendy. Ethics Committees are not known for their courage. I'm sorry. Shipments got out. What are you guys doing? About what? The holidays. We're fine. Fine? Tell me to butt out. Butt out. I better roll. - Call. - Yeah, sure. Neil, Merry Christmas. ( sighs ) Thanks. You too. Didn't think you'd be home yet. - Just got in. - Anything different? At the hospital? Lousy numbers, all around. Christmas present. $207,000. I thought you paid this already. I bought that new pair of shoes instead. I don't think you can do that. Let's get out of here. And go where? On a date. A what? A date. I've forgotten how. Let's fake it. Santa: Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas. Ah, ah, ah, What are you doing? Hinting for handouts. How did you get my number? It's not in the book. All right, I just didn't want you to think that I was always such a bargain, that's all. Life is short. If we're spending it like there's no tomorrow, you may as well spend it on me. Let's go in. ( music box playing ) Mozart. It's Mozart. Can we get it for her... for Katy? She's never heard music. ( phone ringing ) Hello. Yes. Thank you. They want us down at the hospital right away. ( dramatic music playing ) Woman on PA: Dr. Warren, NICU Dr. Warren, NICU, please. Her heart is just giving out. We did everything we could, I'm sorry. This is not what we were working towards but we could just never catch up. Have you taken her off the ventilator? We'll need your consent. Our consent? I have some forms for you to sign. They're in my office. - Is she in any pain? - No, no pain. She'll breath on her own but only for a few hours. I want to take her home. I want to take her home. ( music box playing Mozart )
