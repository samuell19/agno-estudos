Hello Ma'am! Beautiful day isn't it? Go to hell. Hey dude! Can you spare some change? No! Love the hair though! [DOOR BUZZES] Fuck! I can't wear the shirt I wanted. It's too small. It looks like my tits are gonna pop out. Sarah! I just don't think that would look very good in the pictures. Yes but we have to leave in fifteen minutes. Don't pressure me. I told you, I don't want to be pressured! I know. I know. But do you have to wear your hair like this? Like what? Can't you just fix it a little? I did already! Hey all! Sarah... Look what I got for you. Pearls! Aren't they pretty? I found them on the subway but you can borrow them from me. You know - something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue! Do you have something blue? No. Hello Mama! - Sarah. You look sparkling today! Oh, really. Well, thank you Kyle. Aren't you excited about your son getting married? More nervous I guess. I'm the best man you know. I know that Kyle. Oh, you must be so proud of him. Look how beautiful he is! Kyle, can you get her to finish please? Me and mama have to get some flowers from the deli. Are you sure you don't want anything in particular? Maybe some nice tulips? I guess not. Let's go. Get something blue! Sarah - come on! Quickly! Come on! Yes, it seems to fit alright. Thanks Danny. Hey hurry up guys! It's our turn! Ok, let's go. Come on! Shit, I can't get it on. Ok wait, let me help you. OK, look like you are putting it on so mommy can take a picture. Marcel. Sarah - I now pronounce you, husband and wife. You may kiss or embrace. Right over here. Come on! I can't believe that you made us come all the way out here! Stop it Danny! I told you, I want to get some nice pictures. Kyle stand right here. Stand beside him. Danny over here. Sarah next to me. Come on! Hold this like so. Ready? Smile! OK now with just Sarah please. Oh, come on! Can you please just relax and smile, and look at the camera. How about a picture of the Groom and the Best Man? Stole a kiss! What about Sarah throwing her wedding bouquet away? Finally. I can't wait to get ride of this thing! Alright. I got it. I got it. I wonder what this means... I guess I better get a divorce... very quickly. Let's hope immigration never sees those photos! It made my mom so excitied... to be able to tell all her friends that I got married. She wants those pictures! She's too much! - I know I don't want all my friends at home to hear that I got married to some guy. That's disgusting! Well you did! Cheers! Kyle, how come Sarah agreed to this? She's getting the apartment. She's getting your apartment?. She was supposed to move out, so that Kyle could move in with me. But now I'm moving out. But where are you going to live? I don't know yet, mama. Yes but unless I get a Greencard I will have to move back to Europe as well. [GLASS-CLlNKlNG] There's something I'd like to say. I'm the Best Man. I'm supposed to say something, right?. I met Marcel a year and three months ago today. I'd just moved to New York, and one night I walked into a bar... And there he was. My heart almost stopped when I saw him. I just knew... Marcel, ever since that day - I have loved you more than anyone has ever loved. Everyday you make me so happy. Marcel - Je t'aime pourtourjours. Do you wanna marry me? Yes Kyle! Yes. I love you too so very much! There's nothing I want more. [APPLAUSE] You do realize I thought you were a freak? When? When we met. Really? I thought I was charming... Freakishly charming I would say... I don't mean to stare at you, but you have gorgeous eyes. Thank you. Is that your boyfriend standing over there? No. Do you have a boyfriend? No. Do you want one? That depends who's asking. I'm Kyle. What?. Kyle! Like... Kyle. Oh, I'm Marcel. Where are you from? France. Vacation? School. Acting school. But I'm almost finished. I love you. What?. Nothing. I'm sorry. I thought you said... I did. I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound crazy. Normally I wouldn't... But I just can't take my eyes off you. That's OK, I noticed you too. So, um, what kind of a boyfriend are you looking for? Oh, I don't know. No seriously, if you could have anyone in here, who'd you pick? Come on, tell me. Would it be my friend Ben? Probably not. OK, so who? Maybe him. OK, let me go see if he's available. Excuse me! I was just wondering, do you have a boyfriend? Cause my friend over there thinks you're cute. Sorry, he was taken. You're gonna have to pick someone else. You're crazy! Come on. Him! Oh sorry. Strippers are off limits. Maybe you then. Well now we're getting somewhere... Hi boys! Hello mama! I just don't understand why you two don't move to Europe and just get married to each other. And you Marcel, you would not have to go through all this charade. Merci mama. But we want to live here. I just don't understand it... So where's your wife tonight?. Oh, I don't know. She said she was going to play some pool with Danny. Not ready to consummate the marriage yet, huh? No, we decided that could wait. I told her you would be willing to take on her marriage duties. At least for the wedding night. Sure, I'll entertain the groom while the wife's playing pool. No problem at all. Fuck you asshole! Who do you think you are? I don't do that shit! Get back here. I want my money back! Fuck you motherfucker! You're lucky I don't call the cops on you. Thank you. Sorry I'm late. Did you just get off?. Oh, just about ten minutes ago. Bye Kyle! Bye. I'm sorry I was late baby, but we'll still make the show if we hurry. It's not that. What then? Guess who just called? Who? My sister. April? Yeah. Well? She says she wants to be friends again. She says she regrets everything that happened... So? I don't know. You're not ready to forgive? I know it's been over a year but it's been a good year. And I really haven't missed her at all. You tell him to go fuck himself! That fucking superior son-of-a-bitch! This has nothing to do with Marcel. I think you need help. Professional help, 'cause l can't take care of you anymore. Not mentally, and not financially. Believe me, I don't want your charity! I can't even bring my boyfriend over to visit because I never know how and when you'll be acting up. Well, no need to worry about that anymore. And part of me feels she doesn't deserve my friendship again. She is your sister. And part of me feels she's my sister. And don't worry about yourmoney. You'll get it back. Yeah, whatever. Besides, I don't want your hooking money. Fuck you. I told you, I don't do that. April, I know. It's none of your fucking business what I do. She said she's not turning tricks anymore. Maybe you should give her a chance. Family is very important, you know. Sometimes, family is all you've got. Get out of my fucking life already. For once and for fucking all! Fine. I'll be back to get the rest of this stuff this afternoon. I don't need her any more. I got my family right here. Yes I know baby, but maybe she needs you. Hey, this is good stuff. Yeah. Real good. You think we should help them? Yeah, probably. I still can't believe our luck getting this apartment. Isn't that crazy? Just across the hall. It's great your landlord likes you so much -- He probably could've gotten much more for this place. I know. And this is definitely the easiest move I have ever had. And the most exciting... Are you sure you are ready for us living together? I've never been more sure of anything. Their constant lovy-doviness makes me wanna shoot myself. I mean I love them and all but, God am I happy not to have to look at that every day. I mean praise the lord for my own apartment! Only in New York. What?. Only in this crazy town would someone marry for a lease. You know what else is crazy? When I told my mom, She said that she would have given me money for a broker's fee. It wouldn't have helped though. Why not?. Well you still don't have a credit history. Oh sure I do, it's just not very good. Nice! They are handmade from France. Gorgeous. You know, this place is just perfect! And with Sarah living down the hall, she and I are practically living together without having to live together. God knows that was getting on my nerves. She's so peculiar. Maybe you'll find me peculiar too... I always have. You can never leave me. Hi. Hi. How are you? Good. Something to drink? Oh, lce-tea please. Coming right up. And Marcel? Are you still together?. Yeah. He says hi. We just moved in together. And you got married? Well engaged. We exchanged rings. Congratulations. Thanks. And you? Anyone new in your life? Oh, well these two! Yeah, I noticed they look bigger! I had to get rid of the old ones, I had too much scar tissue building up. Oh, I'm sorry. You know Kyle, it was us against the world. Ever since mom's suicide. We always knew that no matter what, we could count on each other. Do you think we could be best friends again? I would like that. I'm a different person now, Kyle. And I'm really sorry about everything. Me too. I'm sorry too. No, I understand. I can't say that I want this though, especially considering all the things you told me about her. Don't let her know that you know. Sarah, try to smile OK? I wasn't even thinking about that, it's more the other things. She's obviously not the most responsible person. I'm happy you found each other again, I just didn't expect this. It's only for a couple of days. Her rent is way overdue and she's got to be out of that place now. Sure. She gives me that feeling again though. What feeling? I don't know... Baby, she loves you. Now smile! [WHlSTLE] [DOOR OPENS] Hi all! Hey girl! Did everything go OK? Yes. Kyle, can you help me with my things? I dumped all the furniture, but Gina's downstairs in her mother's car and it's stuffed. Of course. Oh thank you so much for everything. I know, my life's just insane! Marcel, how are you? Good. Hi, I'm April. Sarah. Nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you... What does she mean? You didn't tell anyone about...? Of course not. She means the other thing. I can't believe all the cool stuff you got. When did you buy all this? Kyle? Yeah? I missed you. Kyle, aren't you coming to bed soon? Yeah honey, just a minute. Can't you stay in here and we can talk all night like we used to? We'll talk tomorrow. Good night. [FRONTDOOR OPENS. LAUGHTER] That is nuts! Hey baby! I already ate since I didn't hear back from you. Oh that's OK, April and I got pizza. We're going to put an ad online for band members, so we can start our band again. Isn't that exciting? I thought we were going to look at that sofa tonight?. Oh, let's do that later. We want to get this done. Besides as long as April's staying in here, what's the point, right? Yeah. I'm fine sleeping on the floor. Baby I got a surprise for you! What is it? Over here. I'll be right back. What is it? Oh baby... I remember when we took this. Thank you. We should put it up. Ok, ready? Smile. I love holding you. I love feeling your heartbeat. I love looking into your eyes. I love your body. Your nose... Your lips... I love you. I know it's too early to say that after just six days... but I'm just crazy about you. I can't imagine life without you now. Hearing you say that just fills my heart. How can I describe how happy you make me? I really, truly feel that... My God. What can I say I've already said too much? You haven't said too much. What do you want? We got a letter from immigration today -- They moved up our interview. It's already next Friday. Are you serious? They can't just do that. Well they can, they did. Shit, we haven't even started rehearsing yet. We have to do it everyday. No! Sarah remember that guitar you wanted? Yeah. It cost about two-fifty right? Uh-huh. If we pass, I'll buy it for you. But we have to work really hard. Deal. Come back in an hour. I don't wear makeup. Even if I was straight I wouldn't wear makeup. My sister for example, is very straight and she doesn't wear makeup. Ever! The thing is though we want to look professional. We want to look like we have our shit together so we come across... Iike responsible, totally normal people. I'm a musician. I live in the East Village! Do you think it would look totally normal - To have me go in there looking like a lawyer?. Fat chance. Look, if I'm going to be able to go through with this, I have to go as myself. Fine. No makeup. But can you at least wear a dress so you look a little bit more feminine? I don't have any. I will get you one. Listen it can be totally hip. Totally you. I don't wear dresses. Please! I will get you something that you like and then you can keep it. How about you buy the dress and then after the interview... I return it and keep the money? Fine. But the ring has to go back too and I wont let you keep the money for that. I just hope K-mart will take it back. It does look a little bent. I think Sarah's right. You should let her be herself. It's important that she feels as comfortable as possible right?. The thing is that we don't look like a couple. I look like a decent citizen and she looks like a lesbian street hustler. Well that's the woman you married. I know, but can't she be just a little more cooperative? It's just for a couple of hours. Well you are the actor. You've got to be more like her. I mean fuck respectability, the important thing is you come across as a couple right? [KNOCK ON DOOR] Hi guys! I'm gonna take a nap. Can you please let Gina in when she comes over? We're going out later. How's the job search going? I got a few leads. Nice guys. But how long is she staying? I don't know, she's in a lot of trouble right now. Sarah how and when did you and Marcel meet?. We met at Thanksgiving. Two years ago. I know she's your sister, but she's not even looking for a place. Marcel... Smile. Tell me about Sarah's family. Well I've only met your brother James. Sarah, what's Marcel's mother's name? Fuck off! I just wanna play pool and get drunk. Sarah the interview is in two days. What's Marcel's mother's name? I can't think about this all the time. It's driving me crazy! I'm not gonna be able to do it! What's Marcel's mother's name? Marie. Wrong! The correct answer is Catherine. Now smile. Hey! Hey! Stole a kiss. Yeah, I got a bigger size. You know I'm a big girl. I have to keep massaging them though. They're really hard! She has to save some money up first. For deposit and all that. No fucking way! Are you kidding me? So why isn't she working? well it's tough to go back to a regular job after making so much money Do you even realize how crazy this logic is? She's not comfortable prostituting anymore... Shhh... That's great. I'm happy she stopped. But then she gets kicked out of her apartment... Because she gets a boob job instead of paying her rent. And then she just moves in with us. It's temporary. She's been lying around here for almost two months, and she hasn't even looked for a place. Because she doesn't have any money. Because she doesn't wanna get a job. Because it's too hard for her to work an entire day... and barely make what she used to in half an hour! Do you want to push my sister back into working the streets? I want her to move out. You're such an asshole. Kyle what about us? I couldn't help but overhear this conversation. Marcel is just a bit stressed right now because of his interview tomorrow. Well he should know that I'm here as your guest. You've overstayed your welcome. Kyle, tell him I can stay. Kyle and l make these decisions together. You're the one pushing him around, making decisions for the both of you. Look, both Kyle and I are working our asses off waiting tables. I know that you're used to having him cover over your ass... but I will certainly not be taken advantage of any longer. Kyle! How can you allow this? Marcel... This slobbering around... Occupying the entire living room with your shit! using our phone, eating our food, leaving your dirty dishes... Don't talk to her like that! Fine. I'm out of here. But when I come back, I want to know the date she's moving out, and it better be within a week! She doesn't have anywhere else to go. I can't stand this living situation any longer. How can you be so selfish? If I'm selfish it's for us. She's my sister... That's what scares me so... That blood is thicker than water. that you will choose her over me. I don't wanna choose. Why should I have to choose? I want both my boyfriend and my sister in my life. I deserve to have both. ? Flying high like a dove ? ? You and me in the night heat ? ? All the angels above ? ? what's the color of love. ? Shh! We can't be this loud. It's really late. We have to practice for the concert. And rehearsal with Tommy is tomorrow. I know. I can't believe he got us a gig already. We have to work really hard. As long as Marcel will allow it. Don't say things like that. If you kick him out, you and I can stay here together. April! What?. I know he'd prefer if l was out of your life completely. April, please. what? Can't you just try and make friends with him? He's the one going postal on me! And he's so possessive of you. You do know that? [FRONTDOOR UNLOCKlNG] I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. You know when I hear your keys in the door my whole heart just bursts with love. My baby's home! It's the two most amazing seconds of my day. Baby, I love you! Do you realize that this was our first fight ever? That is just crazy. I know. Let's never fight again. Deal. I guess I'm under a lot of stress. I'm sorry for being so mean to April. It's okay, I know she drives a lot of people crazy, but she's leaving soon. Promise? Promise. So baby, are you ready for tomorrow? I think so. I just hope Sarah will be OK. She's so nervous. It will go wonderful. You just have to wait. Have a seat. You just have to wait. Have a seat. Sorry, it's going to take longer. The process is always like this... They might be watching us. Try to look like you're in love. I'm trying! Do you see any? Any what?. Cameras? No they must have hidden them very well. I can't believe they have us wait this long... We had a ten o'clock appointment. It's already one! I know. I hate immigration. Immigration is fucked up. Shhh! Marcel Colard! Okay honey it's us. Let's do it. I love you. I love you too, sugar muffin. Repeat after me. I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So help me God. I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So help me God. Sit down. When's your husbands birthday? June 22. When's your wife's birthday? July 5. We're both cancers! Where does your husband work? He works at the Madison Square Café. Café Blanc is the name of the corporation, but the restaurant is called Madison Square Café. How much is your husband making? Oh, he takes home about five hundred a week. Really? I know it says in that letter from my boss that I make seven hundred a week... but I work in an outdoor restaurant, and with the weather we've been having so far, five hundred is really all that I've been making. Where does your wife work? Marvin's records. Why does it say here that your single in this paper? I know that I filled out the paperwork saying that I was married but... maybe because I asked them to take out the higher single rate, they fucked it up. Screwed it up. What was your taxable income last year? About 25 thousand? Really? No! Honey, it was much higher than that, maybe 35? I did the taxes and I can't even remember. Sarah has no clue about our finances. So what other proof do you two have that you're together?. Well we have our joint apartment lease. Joint bank account. We have some pictures. Who's that? Oh that's our friend Danny. He's responsible for us getting together in the first place. Who's that? That is Sarah's friend Megan, and that is my mother. What's your husband's mother's name? Catherine. Why didn't your parents make it to the wedding? Well they couldn't get away. They have a farm. But we're going to go home to Arizona for Christmas this year. And Sarah is going to teach me horseback riding. So you'd say that your parents approve of the marriage? Oh yes, of course! My mother, she wants for me what I want. She's really cool. Well I guess you wont mind my calling her then, will ya? No, of course not. Well write down the number. Hello! Its an answering machine. Do you have another number?. No, I don't. Well... do you have any other proof that you're together? I don't know. Bills maybe? Well I asked the phone company to put both our names on bill but they wouldn't. Well, what about more bank accounts? Look, we have one bank account, okay? That's all that we need. We've only been married for a little while and we don't have everything joint yet! These things happen gradually. Here. Yeah, I think you should have that checked out. Well I already made an appointment with... We passed! We passed! We passed! ? What's the color oflove ? ? What's the case of my heartbeat ? ? Call the angels above ? ? What's the color of love ? ? Flying high like a dove ? ? You and me in the night heat ? ? All the angels above ? ?

For our two year anniversary. ? We had a chance in a million to one ? ? Driving the corvette down the road on the run ? ? Oh, running in the night. Oh, running in the night ? ?

Day by day love is coming my way ? ? 'Cause he's my boyfriend. Boyfriend ? I really think you should let go of your anger on that line and start breaking down there. That would be a stronger choice and you would show your range. [FRONT DOOR OPENS] Oh my God! Did you see that?. What was he wearing? Hey baby! Hey Jenny! How are you? Hi! Honey what are you doing home? We have to write some cover letters to music agents. But I'm rehearsing for my audition. You weren't supposed to be back until after four. We'll be in the bedroom. We won't disturb you. Please we need privacy. We talked about this. No we didn't. You told me not to come home until four. I never agreed to it. You can't tell me what to do. I live here too. Baby, I'll make it up to you. Leave now and come back at four. You can't tell him what to do. He pays rent too. Yeah. Well you don't, so stay out of this. I moved out didn't l? Finally. Marcel, we're not leaving. Come on. You know how important this is to me! April has an appointment later! And we have to get these letters done today. Yeah. This is ridiculous. Stay out of it! No you stay out of here. And we'll stay out of there! ? Gonna run away. Where he goes I will stay ? ? 'Cause he's my boyfriend. Boyfriend ? ? Day by day... ? Why do you put up with that shit?. He's not always like that. ? He's my boyfriend ? ? He's my boyfriend ? There's a lot of scar tissue build up. Your body is definitely rejecting them. I'm afraid you need to have them removed. Goodbye April. I decided to go back to being a boy. Really? If I can't have breasts, what kind of woman am I gonna be? Besides, I wasn't ever sure if I wanted to go through with it. Gina still regrets having cut it off. Have you really thought it through? This isn't the first time you've tried this. Are you sure you can be happy as a boy? I have to. I'm gonna get on male hormones instead. And the doctor says I can get fake testicles. Wow. I'm so used to you being April now. It'll be for good this time. I'm gonna have my breasts removed in a couple of weeks. And I'll be Cole again. Hey. I'll always love you. No matter what you do. I know. What the fuck? What is she doing in our bed? Sleeping. It got late. Come to bed. I've been shooting since seven this morning. I can't deal with this right now. I want her out of our bed. That's fine. I can sleep on the sofa. I thought you moved out. Here's twenty dollars for a cab. Don't insult me! I don't need your money. April is staying. Does she have to be in our fucking bed too? I mean come on! You're a selfish fucking asshole! Kyle, I don't know what you're doing with him and I'll never understand it. I"m sorry that I find it disturbing to have prostitutes between my clean sheets. How dare you? Don't say shit like that to my sister! You have no idea what she's been going through! I didn't say it to her. It was a general statement. Besides you know she's doing it again. Why do you destroy things between us like this? Why do you let her destroy things between us like this? Goodnight Kyle. I'll see you tomorrow. April! [DOOR SLAMS] I hate you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. I love you.

Please come home. I can't we're on a flow. It sounds like you're having a party. We're just taking a little break. You've been writing for two days straight. Isn't it cool? Baby I miss you. I thought we could spend some time together. Just you and me like normal couples do. Well we're working. Besides you're busy with your play and the short film... and if you get that part you'll be in L.A. for months. The more reason for us to spend time together. It's not a competition you know. It's two a.m. Baby, please come home to sleep tonight. You can go back to work in the morning. I gotta go! Look I'll talk to you tomorrow after work. Je t'aime pour toujours. God, isn't his boyfriend so annoying. Yeah, that's why I don't do relationships. Yeah, that and the fact that no one wants you. Bitch. Thanks guys. I'll talk to you soon. Bye. Good night Ben! You just hate all my friends. I don't hate Ben, I just don't see why you would invite him along to the movies. This was our first night off together in two weeks. Ben is my friend. And he was lonely tonight. But you don't want me to have any friends. Why aren't we important to you? What do you mean? We. You and me. Why aren't we more important to you? Is it so strange to want to spend some time alone with your boyfriend? I find it very strange that you don't seem to care. Of course I care. It doesn't seem like it. I care! You spend three times as much time with April as you do with me. We're working together. Besides we have to get our demo ready for that manager. Why do you bring April up anyway? Everything is not her fault you know. I'm not so sure. What's that supposed to mean? I don't know. You seem so different now. The more time you spend with her the less... I don't wanna hear any shit about my sister! I got the part. You got the part? I'm flying to LAThursday. We start rehearsals Monday. So soon! Wow that's amazing! Congratulations, baby. So how long will you be gone? A month. So April could stay here while you're gone right?. It's going to be really tough for her now that she's changing sex again. It's just temporarily of course, she wouldn't dream of sticking around while you're back. Do you promise me that she will be gone before I come home? Of course! Oh thank you baby. Let me call her and tell her the good news. You know, it will be really hard to go. Why? It'll be fun won't it? It's hard because you seem so indifferent about it. No, baby, of course not. And I miss you already. But listen. I'll just focus on my work while your gone... And when you get back, I'll have several new songs to play you. So Kyle told me you're gonna be a man again. Yep. Implants come out tomorrow. So you're not really a woman then? What?. On the inside. It's not that simple. Well its too bad. What?. I never got a chance to play with them. You wanna touch them? Go ahead. They're kinda hard from the scar tissue though. Well they look good. I know. I'm gonna miss them. Yeah you're right. They feel fake. Oh, it's okay. I'm sure you'll make a good looking man too. Of course. Not that you'll care. No I'm already married to one. Right. That one. You know Marcel didn't seem too happy before he left for LA. I think something's going on with Kyle. Well you know that's life. Nothing lasts forever. Are you serious? They might break up? I always thought they'd be the ones to prove that gay relationships can last forever. Well, I for one never thought they were right for each other. Your turn. They don't know when the shooting will start now. Apparently they lost some of the financing, it might be another week. Listen, honey, I'm not happy here. I miss you terribly. Do you? Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. [FRONTDOOR OPENS] Where's April? Look I gotta go. Sarah just arrived. I love you too. Bye. Bye. Cole is in the bedroom sleeping. They gave him a lot of drugs. Really? Is he gonna use them all? Her chest is all fucked up. They say they can restore it though. His chest. I don't get it. I thought all trannys were supposed to be certain they were born the wrong sex in order to go through with all of that. Well some probably are but Cole never was. This isn't the first time he's gone back to being a boy. Really? Anyway, he needs a lot of support right now. Luckily Marcel isn't home. You know... I'm feeling really sad. Why? Because you miss him? No. Because I don't miss him. I so hope it works out with you two. He can be so egocentric. It's all about him. Actors! I know. You look great. I'm not ready for a photo shoot. We really need those new promo shots of you. And it's time you start leaving the house. Are you sure I look okay? Of course! Just stop tweezing those eyebrows. Yeah, you should be talking! Cole, can I ask you something? If it's about you know who, you know what I think. It was so good. It was supposed to last forever. You know Kyle, it's better to have loved and lost... than to spend the rest of your life with a controlling, self serving SOB. ♫ When you weren't around I was okay ? ♫ I used to have time formyfriends all day ? ♫ When you weren 't around I was alright ? ♫ I need sometime alone tonight ? ♫ So what will you do if I leave you here alone ? ♫ How will you feel if I won 't be coming home ? ♫Cause I got myself to save so I might be gone ? ♫ if you call on me tonight ? ♫Between love and goodbye ? ♫ I won 't be living in the middle this time ? ♫ Between love and goodbye ? ♫ I got a heart of gold you 'll never find ?

So didn't you hear me on the answering machine? No, I did. But you didn't pick up? I didn't feel like talking to anyone last night. Kyle? Yes. You screen me out?. Me, your boyfriend, you didn't pick up when I called? Marcel... No you told me many many times no matter what you would always love me. I just need a little time. No. Just a little time... No way. No! To figure things out! What things? What?. You wanna take a break is that what you're saying? I don't really know what I want. Just... Please don't make this harder than it has to be. I'm already miserable as it is being away from home... But you see this as a great opportunity to break up. I'm not breaking up. I just need some time alone, okay? Let's just not talk for a while. Let's just figure this out. You can't pretend you didn't see this coming. I'm not pretending. ♫ The thought of losingyou tonight ? ♫ Makes me wanna stay and fight ? ?

[LAUGHTER] [FRONT DOOR SLAMS] What the...? I think Cole and I are going to go over to my place. Right Cole? Sure. I tried not to call either so that you would miss me. But you didn't, so I had to come home. They cut my best scenes anyway. My agent wasn't very happy about it though but I couldn't stay away any longer. So you're saying you want me to give our relationship another chance? No. No? No I want you, us, to give it several new chances, Unlimited tries. What I want is for us to never give up. Never. But to keep adjusting, and trying and fixing... And loving. Forever! To never give up! That's what I want. Baby you're crying. Kyle, what's wrong? Please tell me. Whatever it is we can fix it together. Something happened. What?. It's okay. I forgive you. No. No, it's not okay. How can you just forgive me like that? I was away. You felt lonely and horny. These things happen sometimes. Have these things happened to you? No. Marcel this is really important. The fact that you don't seem to care that I did, tells me that you probably did too. Once. You did? Oh God I promised myself I'd never tell you this... but, last spring, while you were away in Ohio... I met this guy at the Phoenix. Yeah? Nothing really happened. There was just this... strong attraction, and then we kind of left together. I mean, we were both going in the same direction. Did you have sex with him? No, definitely not. I don't know why, I went upstairs with him. It was just so exciting. And I only stayed for a little bit. But you didn't sleep with him? No. Of course not. He just... sucked me off a little. Did you suck him off a little? I guess... a little. How could you? I don't know. I didn't mean to. And it meant nothing. And I felt so guilty about it ever since. We were so happy together then. I know. It had nothing to do with you. And it didn't mean I loved you any less. It just kind of happened. Has it happened again? No. Definitely not. Please, it meant nothing. It meant everything. Lea will be here any minute, so you have to go as soon as she comes okay? How do I look? You could fix your hair a little. Whatever. It's not like it's a date anyway. I met her at a poetry reading. She's just coming over for some mac and cheese. Look, Marcel, just stay out of his face for a while okay? Whatever you do, don't try to confront him or make him change his mind. You know you can be a little bit obsessive. Not attractive. Just give him some space. And some time. You know you shouldn't have come home like that. And you shouldn't have told him about the cheating. Big mistake. I know. [DOOR BUZZES] Oh. Tiime to go. I do hope it works out between you. You shouldn't have told him about the cheating. Hi. Hi. Come on in. ? Although we know it isn't right ? ? It didn't stop us from making a scene tonight. ? ? I should've seen thatyou were making your way outta here ? ? It's not the first time, but it's the last ? ? I guarantee you'll be trying to win me back ? ? If you could get out of that mirror ? ? You're a born loser, you're out of your mind ? ? You're a born loser, and I was so blind ? ? You're a born loser, loser ? ? You're losing me for good this time ? ? You're losing me for good this time ? ? You run around telling all your friends ? ? My little secrets, I told you in confidence ? ? And all the stories are making a star out of me ? ? You got the act and drama down ? ? You turn them all against me in this town ? ? Am I the only one who sees? ? ? You're a born loser, you're out of your mind ? ? You're a born loser, and I was so blind ? ? You're a born loser ? ? You're losing me for good this time ? ? You're losing me for good this time ? ? You 're gonna lose me ? ? You're a born loser ? ? You 're gonna lose me ? ? You're born a loser ? ? You're a born loser, you're out of your mind ? ? You're a born loser, and I was so blind ? ? You're a born loser ? ? You're losing me for good this time ? You once told me that the most loving couple of seconds of your day, is when you hear my keys in the door and you realize that I am home. Your baby's home. Do you remember that?. Now you're telling me you don't wanna hear my keys in the door anymore? That you don't want me to come home? Ever again? I mean it's just... I just don't get it! It's so crazy. It's so ludicrous that it's impossible to... You're telling me that... You're telling me that... I'm telling you that I don't love you anymore. No. Kyle how can you not love me anymore? You used to love me so much that... Right Marcel. Used to. Get it? Try to understand, I don't love you anymore. We stopped having fun together and it's time to move on. You asked me to marry you! You can't decide it's over because we're not having fun. I mean come on! We can change that. How? Well, we can go to therapy to... To find out... That's ridiculous. That's so fucking stupid! Listen, there are so many, many things that we can do... spend more time together, for one, go away together, perhaps? The important thing is that we can fix this together! For the longest time I gave away all my power to you, and you took it. I'm not about to redo that mistake. Are those your word or April's? His name is Cole. And no I can speak for myself. Marcel it's time to face the facts. It's over. No it's not. Stop saying that. We can fight this! I don't know which part of this you don't understand. I don't want to. And that is that. I'm an artist. And I have to follow my heart. And my heart tells me, it's over. Well, my heart tells me that it's not. I don't know why you're acting so surprised. Honey -- Life sucks. You win some, you lose some. I always used to debate... Am I in love? This feels like love, right?. Is this real love? I've only known you for a week. Not even a week. But now I know what real love feels like. I told you. As soon as our eyes met, I just knew. Hey how do you say that in French? Say what? I love you. Je t'aime. J'taime. Forever?. Pour toujours. Je t'taime, Marcel. Pour toujours. I wrote him a love letter, like you told me, saying goodbye. And I didn't give it to him. I hid it in one of his books. Maybe one day he will find it, and realize how much he misses me. You know, Jenny, sometimes I think it would've been better if he had died when he still loved me. Then it would've been forever like he promised. Marcel, it's really important to turn inwards in times of crisis. All the answers are inside. You're gonna feel so much better after this. It's all in the breathing! [DOOR SLAMS] So when are you moving out?. Well I thought I'd just keep staying with Cole in the living room for now, and you can keep the bedroom. That's not going to happen. If you're breaking up with me, then you're out of here. And your brother too. I can't live like this. Well, I'm sorry, but you really don't have a choice. So you're going to bring home your boyfriends, and I mine? If you have a problem with that, why don't you move out?. First you break up with me, then you tell me to move out of my own apartment. It's mine as much as its yours. Whose name is not on the lease? Technically it's all mine. That was just so you and Sarah could both be on the lease. We moved in here together. I found this place. You made one phone call to your landlord. I worked hard to get it. You didn't do shit. The point is; you're breaking up with me. I will get the money together by the first to buy you out of your share of the furniture. Maybe you can move in with Ben until you find a place. And what about Cole? Oh, now I'm responsible for your brother too? Your white trash family sure knows how to take advantage of people. Why don't you just pack your little bags and go back to France, huh? You're single. I don't see what's keeping you in New York. You're not wanted here anymore. You wanna buy me out? Most of this stuff here is mine. Oh that's right, you don't have any money... and I don't belive your brother had an income since he stopped prostituting. Again. You just want me to give you everything, is that it? You're an asshole. And I'm not moving out. No. You're the asshole and I'm talking to you. Can you believe he threatened Kyle with a knife? Can you believe he threatened Kyle with a knife? I mean the guy is losing it. How do you feel, Kyle? Are you sure this is it for you two? I mean, I thought you were just taking some time to figure things out. You two had a good thing going. They did not have a good thing going. Whatever they had it wasn't love because love is about respecting each other. If Marcel ever loved Kyle, he wouldn't treat his friends and his family so poorly. He's a user. He used you and he used Kyle. Maybe Marcel and l used each other. How did he use you, Kyle? Look, Marcel's not a good person. Kyle has no interest in getting back together with him. Or even talking with him. If Marcel has anything to say to Kyle, it needs to go through you. We're done with him! So how about you two move into Danny's room and Danny moves in with Marcel? What?. I told you, you have to move out soon. You're getting on my nerves. It's out of the question. We're not giving up that apartment. It's Kyle's apartment just as much as yours. I won't help you take him to court. I just won't! So let's solve this. I can't live with Danny. Come on we all agreed to this! He's such a slob! Marcel! It was your idea. I changed my mind. You know it wasn't easy convincing Kyle. He feels like it's letting you win. I'm not happy about the terms. Besides if we do this, I need to discuss it with Kyle. He won't speak to you. Then there is no deal. [DOOR SLAMS] Oh hi Kyle. I made dinner for us. I thought we should sit down for a meal, and talk things out. I think we owe it to ourselves. Kyle? Please? I'm not hungry. Kyle, we need to talk. If we're going to do this apartment switch, we need to discuss the details. Sarah told me you said no to it. If you changed your mind, it can go through her. No it can't. I need to talk to you. Look, this is really hard for me. I think it would be easier if we were able to part as friends. Just go. I really don't think we have anything else to say to each other. Ever. Je t'aime pour toujours. Yeah, yeah, yeah... I know you seem to think so. I did come across your little note, by the way. Dear Kyle... I am crying as I sit here writing this. How could this happen between us? Your beautiful eyes that used to be filled with so much love, are now completely cold. And then it goes on to say... Well you should know... You wrote it. It's more of the same pathetic, needy shit really. No wonder your mother put her head into that oven. I used to think that was a strange thing for a mother to do. Abandon a four and a six-year old like that. But hey! It's all really quite clear to me now. In fact your mother was probably the only sane person in your family. Get the fuck out of my room. Now. Stop obsessing about him. I'm not obsessing, I just don't understand... It doesn't matter Marcel. You have to move on. But he... I think he's made it very clear that he's not interested right now. You have to let it go. I can't! You have to! Come on. He's never gonna come around if you make yourself so available and needy. Date... Fuck around... Iike all the other gay boys do. You have to move on Marcel. Oh hi! Rob this is my roommate, Kyle. Kyle, this is Rob. Rob, sit down while I make us a drink. Ciao. How you doing? Oh, don't worry about him. He's just a little upset, because his name is not on the lease, and if he doesn't move out, I will have his things thrown out on the street and change the locks. Sorry. Don't be. If he does, I'll have him arrested. You see, according to New York State law... you can't kick a person out of a place, who's lived there over a month. So both me, and my brother Cole, are staying. I can't believe I didn't dump this guy a long time ago though. But, you know what?. Rob... is it?. Now that I did, I can't tell you how right it feels. You see, Marcel is really a selfish, pathetic creep. Would you like some fresh lemon, Rob? You see the problem with Kyle... is that he will never be happy with anyone, as long as lets his fucking brother run his life. If there was ever a selfish person in our relationship, It was Cole. Cole was right about you the whole time. You're just a mean, petty son-of-a-bitch. I guess this is what happens when you invite homeless, unemployed, ex-transsexual prostitutes into your home. They turn your loved ones against you. I was wrong. I never loved you. If you don't leave, I will take you both to housing court. You can't! Sarah says I have equal rights to this place. Sarah is his wife! Who's also on the lease. And she says we can stay. Your wife? Whatever. Drinks are ready. Let's go. Goodnight, Kyle! [DOOR CLOSES] Oh my God... I love you lips... You got such a gorgeous body... [FOOTSTEPS] [FRONT DOOR SLAMS] You have to leave now. What?. We're finished. I want you to go. What's wrong? We just got going... I can tell you liked it. Just leave. You freak! Who do you think you are, treating me like this? There were plenty of guys I could've gone home with. Good. Go find yourself someone else to fuck. What kind of game are you playing anyway? Your right it was just a game. All pretend. You can't satisfy me one bit. Cocksucker! You wish. You have to get back at him. I really don't feel like having sex with anybody. Especially not with you in the same room. So why don't you make that one little phone call? It'll all be over. You tell him I'm this close to having him deported. Kyle! You are a sweet, wonderful person, How can you even think of doing that?. He'd only have himself to blame. Kyle! What?. He cheated on me, and he didn't tell me about it for a year. Is that what this is about? Among other things. You've seen the way he's been acting up lately, and I'm not gonna let him get that apartment for nothing. Come on! Everything isn't black and white, you know. There are ways to solve this. I know. One phone call. You're stupid to believe that he would do that Sarah! Nobody would ever do that. Even if he would do it to me, he couldn't possibly do it to you. Please, Kyle, we can still solve this. I'll kick Danny out. You and Cole can have this apartment. I'll move in with Marcel. Kick me out? You can't kick me out. My name's on the lease! Only because my name had to be on Marcel's lease. You know very well this is my apartment! But, where am I gonna go? You're not going anywhere. It's too late Sarah. Marcel's not gonna get away with his little games. Not this time. Please! Kyle for my sake. I can get jail time for this! Nothing will happen to you, if you cooperate. You don't know that! They may say that now, but I already lied to immigration under oath. That's a federal offense! Listen we're gonna do this with or without you. You're so stupid Sarah. Please. For my sake, don't call! I'll try to keep you out of it. You can't keep me out of it, I'm married to him! This is so fucked up! He's been asking for this. Are you gonna cooperate? No, Kyle! You're fucked up! I got the number at my place. Let's go. Kyle! Kyle. No, Kyle, please. Please, Kyle, just wait... Sure I can hold. Kyle. Kyle, please don't. Yes. My name is Kyle Thomas. I'd like to report a case of immigration fraud. His name is Marcel Collard. How could you? And you, Sarah, how could you? Don't you dare blame me. You guys are all fucked up! Come on Sarah, you know the freak deserved it. How could you do something so cruel? You underestimated me. I thought more of you than that. You cheated on me! And you on me! Well, it's done. Call them back. Tell them it was a mistake. Just get the fuck out of my room. No. This, in fact, is my living room. Get the fuck out of my room. Don't you touch me again or I'll kill you. Get the fuck out of here now! You better watch it. [SHATTERlNG GLASS] Fuck! I'm gonna fucking kill you! What the fuck? How dare you threaten my brother? I'm gonna call the cops and have you arrested! Bleeding a little are we? Je t'aime Marcel. Pour toujours. ? I wonderwhy the hell I stayin this town ? ? Ain't much to do when the sun goes down ? ? But think about what I'll do when I'm with you. ? ? Still don't know why you went away ? ? When black and white turns into grey ? ? Life is cold but I was warm when I kissed you. ? Mr. Kyle Thomas has already been here. Filed charges against you. For harassment and assault. So what? Is it his word against mine? No, not exactly. He didn't show up with five stitches and a report from the E.R. We'll have him arrested for this. Oh. ? Eternity burned out that day ? ? And I don't know how I'm gonna spend my life without you. ? ? And the church bells are ringing all across the world ? ? And prophesies go unfulfilled ? ? Cause they always told me I would spend my life with you ? ? I won 't say adieu ? I don't know about this Cole, Do you think I even have a case against him? Of course. That's why they want you to come back and testify again. The way he behaved was totally unacceptable. Threatening you with a knife! Threatening to kill you! The cops saw the bruises you had. He's gonna have to pay. Mr. Thomas, stand up. And please turn around. You're under arrest for assault and battery. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford one, we'll provide one for you. No, you can't do this. You understand your rights? - Yes. It's the other way around. ? When I'm with you my heart pounds like rain ? ? When I'm with you I'm immune to pain ? ? When I'm with you I feel no restraint ? ? When I'm with you ? ? And I don't know how I'm gonna live this way ? ? Eternity burned out that day ? ? And I don 't know how I'm gonna spend my life without you ? I just got out. I'm not allowed to go back to the apartment. Luckily Ben was home. It looks like Marcel won this little battle after all. ? And they always told me I would spend my life with you ? ? I won't say adieu ? [DOOR OPENS] You may have gotten rid of Kyle, but your not getting rid of me. And I'm your new roommate until immigration picks you up and puts you on that plane to France. It wont be long now. You put domestic violence on your charges against Kyle You stupid fuck! This whole thing is messed up. My advice to you, just hang tight. Immigration is completely backed up. They weren't able to give them the case number. Right?. Chances are they'll never be able to put this thing together. ? Eternity burned out that day ? ? And I don't know.... ? He says if I move out, he'll pay you for your share of the furniture and the security deposit. I told him to keep dreaming. Ben says we can stay here for a while. He could use the extra rent money. No way. We can't let Marcel win. When immigration picks him up the apartment will be ours. I just have to stick it out a little while longer. Let's not. You're gonna let the asshole get away with this? I can't fucking believe this! Look you got what you wanted, Marcel and I will never get back together now. You won. The D.A. has agreed to let him off with a warning if he agrees to assault charges. And if he stays out of trouble, he wont get a record. Okay. Sounds good. Here's the paperwork where Kyle signs off on the apartment and everything in it. Great. Here's the money order for the furniture. We're all set then. Would you please tell Kyle that I would like to speak with him? For some closure? Not in this lifetime. Well, congratulations on the apartment. Congratulations on Kyle. You did good. Please, You did it yourself. So when I broke up with Julie, she got so vengeful, She called my job and told them I was stealing. And I got fired. But if that hadn't happened, I would've never gotten the job at the café. And I wouldn't have been there when Sarah came in for the poetry reading. What she's saying is that you never really know what's waiting for you in life. That's the beauty of it! It is pretty exciting. My life is completely open to anything now. I mean, who knows who I will spend my next Christmas with? or who I'll meet a year from now? Where I will live ten years from now? Life is pretty darn exciting if one looks at all the possibilities. You know there will always be sunshine after it rains. For something new to start something old has to end. Anything is possible. Anything can happen. Then there is still hope. Of course! Then there will always be hope... ? Yes I rememberlove, ? ? Yes I remember love, ? ? So beautiful ? ? Now I know how hard this breakup was ? ? Cause I remember love ? ? The true meaning of ? ? I remember... ? ? I remember.... Love ? Marcel Colard? Are you Marcel Colard? Yes, that's me. United States Citizenship and lmmigration service... We're conducting an investigation because we have strong reason to believe that you've lied to the US government. What?. Why? Because somebody called and told you some crazy story? No we've got more than that, witnesses, photographs, letters, love notes, All indicating that you've engaged in marriage fraud in order to gain admittance into the United States. We need you to come with us, sir. What the fuck did you do? It's better this way. Should we move back in?
