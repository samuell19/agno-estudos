What are you looking at? I'm looking at that old bucket, thinking... I like you. I like you, because I can say what's on my mind. What? Why haven't you ever kissed me? I'm scared. Scared that when... when Tip asked me if I ever kissed you, I'd have to say yep. That scares you? Well, Tip is my best friend. I don't want to mess with that. I don't want to be with somebody that's scared to be with me. Well, mostly, I don't want it to be like- like when I kissed other girls. Well... Why don't you kiss me right there? I don't have to be like the other girls. Okay, right- where? Right there. All right. Oh. Uh. Okay. Here. Just go like that. The best thing, though, is to not beat yourself up about it, not to let it ride you or hurt you or anything. It's called the butterfly principle, which is, basically, if a bird flaps his wings in Africa, it causes an apple to fall. It caused a chain reaction of a painting to be made of the apple, somebody looks at the painting, forgets they got to pick their mom up at church and runs a red light, and gets whopped for 80 bucks, you know, all because a bird flaps its wings in Zambuga, which is six million miles away. Sambuca, ain't that a drink? Zambuga? Maybe. Hey, did y'all hear about Randall Dover? Uh-uh. Got into that car accident. Yeah, cracked his ass on the steering wheel. Are you kidding me? Pushed his haircut clean to the top of his head. Aw, man. Snapped his whole goddamn neck. They say he's going to be paralyzed and put in a wheelchair. Dude, I've never known anybody in a wheelchair before. Keep him out of the factory a little while. Man, that dude's a dumb ass and he's not a good driver. Hey, Mary-Margaret. Hey, Bust-Ass. Hey. Man, check her out, dude. Look at that on the street. I'd like to hang out with her for a few afternoons, make some pizza. Do what? That's gross. That's gross. I'll tell you. Mary-Margaret. Ow. Pick it up and spin it. The other way, the other way, the other way. Pull it out. Yeah, they got a little grease up on it. Hurry up so we can go eat. I love your green eyes. You got to tell them stuff that's useful- Okay. Well, I mean, my, you know, I'm not Spanish, but that's about it, dude. I'm not supposed to know all the words in the dictionary from it. Don't you got a Spanish cousin? I know that, uh, albondigas AOis "meatball soup." Uh, dios is... Mujer is "woman." Mujer? Mujer? Mujer. I don't think so, dude. M- U-J-E-R. I think seorita AOis woman. That's right. Novia is "girlfriend." Mm-hmm. Tip, I saw your sister's back in town. That's pretty cool. So? Well, I mean, she just, she looks a lot different than the last time I saw her. She's-she's gotten older. Yeah. What are you saying? Don't talk about his sister, man. That was purely just wondering what was happening. He's one of my friends and all, his relatives, I would care about- Y'all ready? I want something greasy. How's it going? Fine. What do you guys want? There's a-Eww. There's a pubic hair by the ashtray. Kind of gross to have to eat next to that. I'm sorry. Try to clean that up. I can get Pager to clean that up for you. Oh, no, Tip. On Tip's jacket. Hey, what do you got with the most fat in it? With the most fat? Bacon. Well, then, bacon it is. What do you guys want? Some black coffee, just straight up. I want two eggs over medium with bacon. Okay. I just want to get a hamburger and cottage cheese. How did you know it was that one? I don't, but it's kind of hit-and-miss with this truck. See, it's so dark in there, I don't even know how you guys even make heads or tails, know what to even start with. Why don't you try putting some mothballs in this tank? You boys think you got all the answers. Don't do anything weird to my truck. Look who's here. What's up, Tip. We're closed. What's up, Leland? Nice ball. Heads up. Come on. We're going to go bother somebody. Bother who? A boy. Hey, Judge. How you doing? What's happening, fellas? Well, we'll take a look at it. Look who's working. Yeah. What are you doing? I was just dumping water out of a bucket. Dumping this dirty water out of this bucket. I want this shined up and- No problem. Hey, Tip, I got this under control. Oh, that's right. I want to drive it. I got to be- Yes. Yes. Yes, sir, I'll just-yes, sir. If you need it by four, I can have it for you by four. Have it for you by four. How are you doing, Justin? Good. I haven't seen you in a while. That's a great shirt you got. Thanks. Tropical. Well, I got to go. My dad's over there waiting for us. Don't work too hard. Okay. Take it easy, you guys. I'll see you later. Are there people waiting in the truck? You going to have it by four this afternoon? Absolutely. Hey, Judge, you bringing this go-kart in here again? What was that all about? I told her you're my number one best friend. Yeah, good for you. Something smells. Why don't you get on this one? Hey, Ma. You find my cutters? Your tools and clown toys are all in the same bag. Is this what you're talking about? No. Well, do you need this? Yes. This damn piano keeps playing the same note. Have you ever thought about a normal pastime? Ethnic cooking, decoupage, Shrinky Dinks? You know, you're just- you're just jealous because, like, I do, like, all of these, like, fun things, and you're just, like, uh, um, a big old fat boy. Girl, I- Get down, sweetheart. Jesus, you're getting heavy. Save me, Uncle Leland. What the hell are they doing out there? It looks like you ain't fixed these pianos yet, Elvira. Oh, I'm working on it. Girl, I'll slap you naked and hide your clothes. Hey, brother. Hi. Come here. Hey, how you doing? Mm. I'm good. All right. You okay? Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine. Yeah? Are you guys working out there or what? No, we were just wrestling. You all right? Hi. Ow. Good Lord! And then I hit my tooth, uh, earlier this morning when I was, uh, working on Joe's carburetor, and I fell, and it looks like I- What happened? What'd you do? Oh, hell, I don't know. Hey, Leland, would you tell your child to stop biting my dog? It's got red marks all over its body from her fangs. Feng-Shui, go! Dogs have bacteria, sweetie. I don't want to be like my brother. Which one? Well, neither of them. Tip spends all day drunk or lazy. He's not like my father, who really worked and studied for everything he has. Well, what do they think of you? I think that they're afraid that I'm going to end up like Tip, living at home four years from now and working at the mill. I worked at the mill one summer, third shift, wrapping blankets in plastic and, um... You're working and they kick- it's like dust and stuff in the air, and there's a sprinkler system that turns on every hour to keep the fibers down, and, uh, you get rained on. At least you had that experience. I've never even been inside. You know, I've never had a real job. Never been paid for anything normal. I just don't want to go to college and have it be like, you know, four years of writing bad, girl poetry and listening to drum circles. Well, I think there's probably just as much bad poetry in the break room at the mill, except it's about Percocet and pecan logs. Yeah. What? I got a secret. Shh. But you have to come here. Come over there? Uh-huh. Hello, hello, hello hello, hello, hello, hello... Keep going. Hey, Bo, if Clivery starts racing this weekend, I might need you to go a little ride-along with me, if you don't mind. I'm not kidding, either. Remember how that guy gets angry? Like that short shoot down at Dries Racetrack, and that dude was rubbing on the back of him? And Clivery got out of his car and climbed a tree and kicked the dude's ass? The dude was up that tree, saying, "Get out. Go. Go down. Go out of this tree. Get out, get. Stop climbing." Do you remember that? Jesus. Hey, let's get some mothballs to make my truck go faster. Why are y'all so quiet? Marshall, uh... says he saw you hanging out with my little sister. Saw you all hanging out. Did he? Well, so what? I mean, it just makes me uncomfortable. I hope he doesn't have any more to talk about. I get uncomfortable, you know, sir? Huh? Well, as long as, you know, we're being honest about things, Mary-Margaret came down here in a sweat earlier, looking for a little bit of games. Me and Nathan Dawes, we tag-teamed in that Festiva, man. So, what, do you love her now? What do you care, man? It ain't like she's your sister or nothing. Damn. "You keep getting older and you don't ever die." God. You know, there are a few things about me you don't know. There are a few things about me that you don't know. Oh, really? Oh, really. I'd like to play you a song about it. Okay. And here we go. Two, three, and- Snake eyes. Going to win. Or lose. That's great. I didn't know you played instruments. Yeah. Tip doesn't say much about that. Well, he doesn't really talk to me, so... Watch the retractor there. Okay, well, I'll watch my own instrument, thank you. You're welcome. Rasta. Are you stupid or just blind, Noel? I'm neither one. You clearly don't know him. What are you talking about? I've seen him fuck every girl in this town. That is not true. It is true. Ask him. Are you going to ask him? Did you sleep with her or not? Then he walks away. I think I hate you. He wouldn't walk away from me. Oh, right, because you're different. Tip... Could you put that down, please? And what makes you so special, huh? What makes you so special, besides the fact that you're new back in town, and you don't know what kind of guy he is? I think I hate you. I hate you. If he's so horrible, why are you his best friend? Put that down! Get out! No, I'm- No. Get a girl to do it. I'm not doing that. But you have such a funny face. Excuse me? Look. No, Mom! Bubbles ate a lot of bad meat. She has sour stomach. I need a hand, a little help, please. I don't know how to do that crap. It's a couple of hours. Please. No. Don't touch me with that clown costume. You- Hello? Awesome, Mom. Awesome. But with you it's... it's different. I like hanging out with you, because... because you look around and listen. You know, um, you follow? And when we were little, I was too dumb to notice. Did you just fart? And here you are. You'll always be happy. Shh... Shh...? Did I say something stupid? No, sometimes, I pretend that I only have 10 seconds left to live. One... Two... Three. Down. Four. Strong. Five. And you got me now. Six. Put on your shirt now. Ten. Ten. I like the mountains. Mixed up a little bit. There we go. All right. It looks good. What's wrong now? Last night, I had a bad dream, and you were in a river, and you weren't moving, and you were freezing, and I was watching you cry. Well, that's all right. Are you staying here with me? Oh, yeah, I'll stay. Be your friend. Always be your daddy. Can I go play now? Mm-hmm. Just like this. Strong as a bird, fast as a can. you know what I mean? Hey, what's going on? You want a pretzel? Strong as an eagle, fast as tea. You know what I mean? It's like Indian talk. Deep. We're going to start a band. Oh, what do you play? I play lap steel. You ever hear of that before? Uh, yeah. Yeah. I'm into it, big time. It's my dream, you know? I tell a lot of people that I'm into the lap steel and they look at me like I'm an alien or something. ...fast as a coat. What I want to do, I'll sit there by myself in the dirt, with nobody around- You know what I mean? ...in the dirt. I'll erase them, you know? Start over and put new ones down, make a wish. That's really cool. I love music. Music makes me happy. I play the trombone. Do you? Mm-hmm. How long? About four years. Yeah, I've been playing the lap steel for longer than that. Really? Like, 10. Wow, since you were... like 12? Do I got anything in my teeth? Tall as a bear. Strong as a can. No, no, a bird. Tricky. It's tricky. Pretzels are carbohydrates and they expand in your stomach and turn to fat. Well... Crouched as a beaver. Here's to... So eat up, eat more. I will. Pancakes expand in your stomach too. Do they really? They do. I didn't know that. Don't you think about, you know, when you order pancakes in a restaurant and it just, like, sits in your stomach like a brick? Usually I don't go for pancakes. Oh, yeah? What do you go for? Eggs. Really? You don't-what about, like, waffles and French toast, and stuff like that? No, the places I go usually are not that fancy. So are you two going out? Well, we hang out a lot. Mm-hmm. You know, uh, it can hurt pretty bad when you get caught up with the guys around here. It's different when it's your family. I wouldn't know that. What Tip sees in you is exactly what he hates in himself. You think he's just going to forgive you and forget about it? Grow up, tell you it's all right? "Go ahead, date my sister. "I've seen what you've done to every other girl in town. It's okay." What do you want me to do, turn things off? What do you want Tip to do? I want him to calm down, I guess. That's not going to happen. Maybe if you didn't go down in every girl's history book as the asshole ex-boyfriend... but you have. I had a dream that you grew a garden on a trampoline, and I was so happy that I invented peanut butter. I saw them together today. What are you doing? What are you saying? What do you mean, what am I saying? He's going to fuck your sister like he fucked me, and everybody else in this town. You fucking my sister? Who are you? Who you think I am? He didn't even feel anything, you know? I was just another girl. I still kept going with him. I thought I loved him. I thought he was in love with me. I thought one day he'd wake up and be in love. I don't even know who you've been talking to. You're lying. You lying son of a bitch. Tip! That's what's going on. Don't! Huh? What's going on? Tip, stop! What are you even talking about? What do you got to give? I don't even know who you been talking to! What do you got to give, Tip? A lot. I got a lot! He's just jealous, man. He wants to fuck his own sister. What? Come on. Come on. Get up. Get up. God. That's because of you, motherfucker! I'm fine. I'm fine. Tip. Tip! No, we ain't friends no more. You ain't even in my top 10. Later, Tip. Who was that girl at the river? Tammy Clinard. She's this girl. Did you date her? Did you sleep with her? You got too much shit on this bed. I got it a long time ago. I was drunk. Wait... Can I say something? I'm sorry. No. Are you okay? No, don't be sorry. What did I do? I just... wanted to say that, um... I've never had sex with anyone before. But I trust you. You trust me? Do you trust me? I've made some ugly mistakes. With girls? The most really ugly, and anything... that- would make you feel more comfortable for you to know, um, I want to tell you that stuff, because I c-care about- because I care about you. Oh, a lot... And when... you know, when people from before come up, yeah, I want you to understand... what they hate when they see me. I think that... I feel like if everything that you've done before makes you who you are now, then no matter how... ugly... it is, I'm just going to have learn how to deal with it, because right now, it's you and me, and... you're the best boy for me to hold on to, and I know that I am the best girl for you, so if you don't choose to say those things, then I won't ask. The first time I had sex I was 13 years old, and it was in a cinder block basement with this older girl that I didn't know, and then when we were all- when we were finished, I was-I was nervous, and I... I was trying to be cool, and I told a joke, and it was stupid, and she never spoke to me again. I want to make sure that a million years from now, I can still see you up close, and we'll still have amazing things to say. I'm going to go now... okay? How am I supposed to think this girl is enough for you, hmm? Well, you'll meet her, and then you'll know. What if you ain't good for her? Crazy. I mean you're not careful, or educated, or honest, or strong... Oh... and you don't have any faith. You're like every man that's ever been in my life. I'm pretty strong. Yeah, and you're funny. You're funny. But you know, baby, I get hurt, and I worry about others like me that don't mean any harm. I've stood where she stands. I've seen the look you have. I'm just happy. Look at me and say that. I'm happy. I don't believe you. Are you in love now, or something? What do you mean? Well, when you finished being in love, you should come over to my house. I got a waterbed. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. When you going to hook me up with your friends? I've been working out. Check out these pipes, look at this. Noel, wait up. Who's number two? Who's backup for you? What? Who would be the second one you'd go with? You can't- First- First choice is not- not available, who's number two? Well, I don't want to choose a number two. Well, you don't have to act on it, or anything, but who, if- Just if you had to, who would it be? Well, it wouldn't be anybody. If you had to choose a back up. Why would I have to choose? You have to. Everyone else is gone. What if I wanted to be alone? Okay, you can't choose alone... or number one, who's number two? Well, what- That's a ridiculous question. Okay, who would you have sex with more, me, or a preacher? All of the people that pass through your life, and they come and they go, finally they're all gone, and there's no- There's no second best, and, and, and she's the one who, who talks to you with, with all you need to be, and she laughs at the funny things you say like she's, she's in on the joke, and then she whispers in your ear. You know, when she first died, I wasn't even shaken, because I could, I could see myself in her eyes before they closed, and I was- I was naked looking over her, and I was primed. But, but, the good stuff that you felt with Elise. Was that worth it? I think about that, about how I'd feel if something happened to you or your mama, or Feng-Shui or... God, love another woman again. I never want to feel... that close... ever again. Are you still seeing Eric? Yes. Why? Still pop the pimples on his back? Ew! I'd rather do that though. I'd rather have him listen to me and me pop his pimples, and- Could we stop about this thing? That's really disgusting. Does he ever get jealous? Yeah. He does? He is jealous. When you talk to another guy? Yeah, but he- I mean he understands a lot times. He'll sit there, and he'll watch, you know... but, you know, just- it's not that much- He's not worried about me, or anything. He's worried about the other man. Right. Men are unpredictable, They're one thing you cannot trust. That's true, I think. I've learned that the hard way, you know? You do not trust men. Have you ever had any bad run-ins with men? Well, I've been in boarding school with all girls since I was 12, so... not much experience. You've got a little something on your hairdo. I like it when you smile at me. Do you want to spend the night together? Oh, you mean like a slumber party? Have a slept- sleep over? We can make a tent out of pillows. I think that's a good idea. Smells like... pork tacos in here. Ooh, two rooms. What do you want to do? What do you- What do you mean? Oh, um, I don't know, did you want to get drunk or something? Not really. Do you want to get drunk? No. No, I don't. I didn't know... No. I don't. Did you want to get beat up by a pillow? Yes, and... Good because that's- Submit. No. I still have my pillow. I realize this. I want to show you something. What...? I used to go fishing a lot... with my dad... One summer when I was... 12, um... we went to Lake Sturtsum together and, um... and I- I was a good fisherman, so I, I used to get to, uh, reel the fish in, you know? And then, uh, my dad would take them and cut them up, and then he'd, uh, cook them, and, and we'd get to eat them, but, uh... one day I was, um, I was driving the boat, and I wasn't supposed to, because I wasn't old enough, but my dad let me take the wheel, because he was drunk, and... there were these kids out in the middle, swimming, you know- Tip doesn't even know this. And um... I guess I let the boat get away from me, you know? And, uh... I ran over this little boy, and um... We thought I must have killed him, because... he wasn't coming up, and everybody was screaming hysterically. My dad pushed me down to the bottom of the boat, and he told me not to look, and, um, I grabbed a fishhook from the bottom, and I just started scratching... my side, and, um... then when I came home, I was all cut up. He had me tell mom and Tip that it was an accident, but it wasn't. You're the first person that I wanted to tell that to, because you're the first person that I've wanted to talk to for more than five minutes... ever. Baby... I like that you- I like that you trust me. Does it hurt... still? It- It hurts, because, um... I know what was going through my head when I did it, that it was like a release, you know, and that... I was glad... I was glad that I had a pain. You're so nice. Shh. Sometimes I'm scared of myself. But I'm not scared with you. You're here. Oh... Get undressed. Get in the water. Are you okay? I thought I was wearing my boxers. It's cool. Two seconds. Quit-ooh-hoo! It's cold. It's cold. You're a baby. Excuse me. You see that right there. See that puppy? That's tough skins right there, girl. I don't know if you know anything about Celtic lore, but that's- that's the Irish symbol for "fistfight." Whoa! Are you okay? I tore my nuts. Oh... no more cannonballs, baby. Only belly flopping, and no more pulling-down-pants games. Only what? Only belly flops. Oh it hurts. I don't like it when it hurts. Shh... Kiss me on my neck. You want me to kiss you on your neck? Right there. All right. Right there? Right there. All right, hold on a second. You sure right there? Mm-hmm. Where again? Right there. I don't want to have sex with you. Are you attracted to me? You're the best. Okay. Will you just sit here with me? Sometimes I can't tell. I just- I wish I could read your mind. I don't want it to be like what it was with the other girls. Hey... Did you fuck her yet? Did you? Is it top secret? Is- I'm not supposed to know? Special delivery. Well, I don't know. If I'd a been going out with her for this long I'd probably at least have felt her boobs. I meant to tell you that. She has nice boobs. Do you think that sometimes your friends aren't good for you? Or that you might not be good for your friends? Hmm? I talked to Beth last night. She and the girls think I'm avoiding them. You mean, you weren't? I guess I just... lost track. So we decided to go to Vicki's lake house next weekend. Oh, just you and the girls are going to go? Well, would you want to go? No. There's timber there and pine needles and cones and sand. I'd get nature in my crannies. Well, I like the lake in the wintertime. I like the sound of water. It makes me pee. I guess that... I'll just go and... learn how to miss you, and you can do the same thing here. Hey, I want to dance... but I don't want you to watch. I can do this for a solid hour. Mom? Mom, what are you doing? What are you doing? Mother. Hello. Where have you been with my car? Hmm? Ah! I forgot about your thing. Mm-hm. Yeah. You were supposed to be here, oh, God, four hours ago, or something like that. Did you know that it was Levante's birthday party? I told you that, actually. I remember you saying something- Yeah, Levante... The kid that couldn't walk. I waited for an hour, and then I rode my bicycle. By the time I got there the party was over, and he was back in bed. Sorry. That's all you have to say? Well, I'm really sorry. Listen, I'm sorry I forgot about it. I don't remember you telling me about it, but I believe you that you did. I've been a little occupied lately, and I understand. I missed it. Where were you? I was... just off. Doing what? Hanging out with... This girl? Yes, with this girl. Mom, I'm not a kid anymore. I've got to go with how I feel. I just do. What- What am- What else am I supposed to do, stop feeling? For your selfishness, I paid the price. I live here, because I love you, and I don't want to see you alone. I'm sorry if you're just jealous or sad, or you just want to shelter me. I'm very happy, actually. God. Jerk. Don't call me a fucking jerk. That's it. Give me that bottle! Let's dip our nuts in whiskey and get the girls drunk! Watch the 26 car. He's coming up behind you. You're mom's going to be pissed. Come on! Hey, Tip. Missed you at the race. We didn't do real well. You'll do right by her? Of course I will. She's, uh... She ain't dated a lot. I know. It's hard for me, because, uh, I know the way you are. You're like me. You're my partner in crime. She makes me decent. Boy, we banged a lot of chicks, huh? We took them down, and we laughed about it on the way home. I like to lick it before I stick it, you know? One time-remember that time I had two girls at once on my daddy's bed? Had me a tongue protruding in each ear. Man, look at us. We're getting old, boy. Not me, man. I never grew up. I still sleep with the light on, wet my bed, I suck my fucking thumb. All the girls I ever been with, I never spent the night away from home. Afraid I'll have bad dreams, man. Everyone thought Justin was retarded. Well, he ain't got nothing on me. Last summer, I had, um, this little ladybug collection. It was real special to me. It... One day I get home from work, and Justin... He let them all go, you know? And I... I know he's just a kid, but I said some... hurtful things, man. You had a ladybug collection? You want to hear something funny? What's that? I'm going to be a daddy. You're going to be a what? Rachel found out about it yesterday. I've been sucking on these master cylinders ever since, man. She's out bawling behind the bushes deciding if she wants to keep it or not. You know, the truth is... I don't want to lose it, man. Last night I decided I don't want to hold any more in. I cried, uh... for the first time since I was a little baby. Can you believe it? I cried because I was happy. I'm a pussy, huh? Yeah, you're a pussy. And I get up this morning, and I cried myself back to sleep again, man. Tip... Huh? Do you love her? Aw, shit. I guess. Well, there you go. Come here. Sit. Good boy. My brother never plays sports with me. Well, this ain't exactly a sport, and Tip's not much of an athlete. He says he thinks I'm a victim. He thinks you're a victim? Yeah. What do you think? Do you miss my sister? Why, do you? Yeah. Yeah, me too. She's nice, ain't she? Could you teach me how to play piano? Teach you how to play what? Could you teach me how to play the piano? Teach you how to play piano? Yeah. Sure I can... for 50 bucks. Huh? Nothing, give me five, dude. Ow, my hand. Hello? Uh, uh... what's up? What's going on? Where are you? I'm at Vicki's lake house. We're having a party. I'm on the deck. You're having a party? It's just a bunch of drunk people. I've got a surprise for you. What kind of a surprise? It's kind of drastic. I don't know if you'll like it. What is it? Yeah. Well, it's a surprise. Well, why don't you just give it to me when you get back here, I guess. Yeah. I was hanging out with Justin. He wants me to play the, er... teach him how to play the piano, but I don't know. I'm not sure what to do. I don't know the right, like, lesson for... because I don't really know how to play the piano that well, but... We've just been hanging out a whole bunch. Hello? Yeah? Are you having a good time? There's this guy, he keeps hitting on me. He's such a dork. I wish he would leave. I miss you. Yeah, I miss you too. So, what is this guy, like, a friend of- a friend of Vicki's or whatever? Yeah, he's just a friend. It's kind of raining here. Is it really? Yeah, really raining actually. Yeah, it must be the precipitation. That was perfect. What's wrong? I think your hair looks great. It makes you look completely different. You think? Yeah. It's great. Where did it all go? No, it makes your eyes look bigger, in a really good way. It's so short! It's not that short. It's pretty short. Well, you know. It looks really good, though. Thank you. I'm really happy you're here. I missed you a little bit. I'm sorry. I'm a little hung-over. I hear you. Big weekend. There was this guy, Patrick, who was there, and he was going around and he was mooning everyone. You'd be talking, and there would be this big butt in front of you. And there was this house of elderly people, and he pulled down his pants and he shoved a firecracker through his legs at them. It was funny. You would have thought it was cool if you were there. Do you, um-? Let me just... Let's go somewhere. I mean, I have a place for us... I have a surprise for you. You do? I do. Come on. No, wait. It's not far, I promise. Listen- Come on. No, could we talk for a second? Sit down. Yeah? I had such a funny weekend. Funny how? There was this guy that I met at the lake. He was a friend of a friend. What about him? Baby? Baby, what did he do to you? What? We fucked. I didn't mean for it... I don't know how it happened. I didn't plan it. I tried so hard not to make it hurt. What, did he hurt you? He raped you? No! Not to make it hurt you. I don't want to hurt you. What are you talking about? Oh, I'm... Uh... I'm talking about what- I don't- I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm trying to be open with you. Why? Just don't say anything. Just shut up. I'm just trying to figure out what I'm going to do here. Wait a second! What am I going to do, huh? How am I supposed to just get past this? What are you...? What are you telling me, that you had sex with some guy? I don't know! I don't know! What do you mean, you don't know? That's what you just said! You just said that to me! I know I said it! I know I said it! But I- I didn't mean- I didn't mean it. Oh, God. I mean, I didn't... Listen, if you just tell me what you want me to do here... I mean, tell me what I did to you so I can figure out how I feel. See, that's what I'm trying to say here, is I need to figure out what I need here, okay? And I feel sick! I feel sick! I feel sick! Who is this guy? You had sex with some guy? Do I know who he is? Just tell me I know who he is. Tell me I know who he is. Where does he live? I love you! I love you. What? I love you! You what?! I love you! Why would you say that? What is wrong with you? What did I do to you? It's just that I love you. I love- Why would you say that right now? Why? Because I want you to love me f- See, I told you- Don't try to correct something that you fucked up by saying I love you! Why would you say that to me? What's wrong with you? What did I do to you? Did you hear me? I said I love you because how else-? How else am I supposed to...? How else am I supposed to explain to you that this isn't something that you did? This is not something that you did. I love you. I- That's how I feel. I'm looking at you right now, and I hear you talking and all the words that are coming out of your mouth are like they're coming out of a stranger. Why don't you put your fucking hair back on and come back? Just come on back. And the worst part is, I don't even know this guy. It's just some guy that she met at a lake, and they're just hanging out at the lake and then... Oh, and then he just fucks her brains out. You know? She's young. She, I mean, you don't understand, she... I've gone through 26 women in my life, and this... All of a sudden I stop, and this girl breaks through the surface. This virgin breaks through the surface and she does the exact same thing to me- She was a virgin? Yeah. You mean you never did it? Good God. Damn, son. If anybody smiles at me ever again, I'm going to freak out. You know, the worst is when it's the middle of the evening... and you say one little thing wrong, and they pitch a fit, and you still got to drive them home. Girls are smart. They- They figured us out. Women make you act like monkeys. You become monkeys, they make you vulnerable. You let your guard down. They identify your weakness, bam, they're in control. It's creative thinking, kind of like when you were dating Kelly. I mean, if you want to bust a nut on half-wits all your life, that's your business. But you're about to have a baby. You couldn't even afford the braces. Thank you. Mary-Margaret, I see you. Where have you been? I haven't been anywhere. I've been right here. Nowhere. Let me get that for you. You lost an earring. You put that back on. I'll put it on for you. You want me to get it on for you? They look great, your earrings. My dad's new wife had a baby. Did he? His name is Bradley- Don't pinch yourself. Well, congratulations to your- Happy birthday. Babies- When babies get born, it's like a woman's time. It's only girls in there. You know, you try to pop your head in, and they don't want you around. I don't know. Listen, I wanted to talk... about when we were dating. I wanted to say to you that if I hurt your feelings... If I hurt your feelings... then I'm sorry. Shut up. I'm sorry to hurt your feelings. Shut up. I'm really sorry, and I'm trying to apologize to you in a real way. You're not sorry. You know how I know that? Because you're not smart enough to be sorry. Guys like you, you don't quit, and you never leave. You're going to be here forever. How does it make you feel, knowing that? Hey, what's happening, Sattler? Nice outfit. Your mom get that for you? Hey, do you want to know a secret that I didn't tell anybody, ever? No. Well, when I was walking the dog I had before Dwayne, I had this dog named Mr. T, because when he was a puppy, he had a- His hair was sticking up like in a Mohawk. And you know how ducks fly home in a V? It's like a V shape? And they get home. And I was walking my dog, and I looked up and there's a big V above me, and I... There's all these ducks flying back to their home. Can I please get a beer? And right when they flew above me... I saw them, and they crashed into a big house, the whole V. And then they hit the ground, and they just kind of curled up. You ever fucking see that? Have you ever seen a mistake in nature? Have you ever seen a animal make a mistake? Hi. Don't do that. That ain't going to help. What about-? What kind of plugs you have in here? Just stock plugs. Really? What kind of gas you put in there? Eighty-seven octane. Oh, wait a minute, y'all put mothballs in here? You put mothballs in here, didn't you? We thought it would go faster. Do you have a ratchet set? You've got to have a ratchet set. I might have one in the back. Where do y'all keep it? Hey. Where you going? What? Come for a ride with me. Why? Because I want to talk to you. Did your car break down? Leland got it started. I mean your truck. What are you thinking about? I'm thinking about how weak I must be for sitting in this car right now. I wish we could talk. It sounds to me like you got Bust-Ass to talk to. We're just friends, and you know it. Oh, you guys are friends? That's awesome. Actually, I didn't know that. I thought he was my friend. But it's great that you guys are tight like that. We just started talking. He's really funny. We went bowling with Blake and those guys earlier. Yeah, I don't know. It's cool this is so easy for you. At least I'm trying. You see, that's where you don't know everything about me. I mean, you know a lot... and that's yours. You can keep it. I'm just a guy who thought he was finally on the right track, making the right moves. Bust-Ass said that- Don't tell me what Bust-Ass said. That's not even his name. His name is Tracy. I don't care what that fucking dick said. I can't even talk to you. Listen to me. Every single girl I ever touched, I regret every night. What does that mean? Are you saying that... you think that we should just forget about each other? That's the saddest thing in the whole world. I'm just saying that, in the future, don't come crying to me, because... Because I'm not fielding any more of your midnight phone calls, because you fucked up. Wait, wait! Please stop! Will you come over one last time? Because I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I want to make sure that the words in my head come across to you. I want you to see the feelings I have for you. You can touch me. Are you okay? I don't know what to say to you anymore. Well, don't say anything. Well, don't smoke in my room. And you sitting around crying, it ain't going to do you any good. I got news for you. You've got to grow up and balance your personal life with responsibility. What am I supposed to do, dress up like a clown and change bedpans? I don't understand why I have to listen to this crap when you know I'm fucking standing here with a broken heart, about ready to slit my wrists? Oh, that's good. That's a good one. Do you know what this is? Do you know what this is?! Clown clothes. That's right. This is what I get for living through hard times. These are the clothes I wear. This is my face now. Do you want to look like me? Do you want to look like this? I was fucking beautiful. Look at me. I got my own battles to tend to. And it don't mean that I don't love you. It don't. It's just, I can see the future, and you got other opportunities. Opportunities I didn't have. And I'm not the kind of mama that's going to... stand by and let her son settle. Where's that going to get you? I just want it to be like she never existed. No, you don't. I can tell you that right now. Hey, Justin, it's good to see you, pal. I missed you. I missed you too. Well, stop the world! You came to the door. I did. I got some stuff to say, if you don't mind. Hey. You got any paper towels? Yeah. We're making macaroni and cheese. Do you want some? No. It's all over. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Take it easy, buddy. Be strong. Ah! Hey! What did you do? Oh, I... I got in a fight with my truck. Does it hurt? Yeah. I'm not the smartest guy in the world. I guess what I was trying to do was become a better person. You know what I think? You know, my problem is not anything that you did. It's between me and... me. When I did what I did... it felt... so... wrong. And that's when I realized that I love you. You can't understand it, but that's when I found out. It's an emotional thing too. Nobody tells you that part. It's true. I miss your face. You know what? You're not allowed to hate me. Because... I'm not going to let you. Nobody said we had to be perfect. I wish it didn't hurt with every thought of you. You have my heart. Hi. Hi. Can you close your eyes? Pretend you can see the ocean. Pretend you're standing over the ocean. You're a millionaire. Pretend you're running under the ocean. You're jumping across mountains. You're jumping across mountains. Everybody loves you. Nice. Sweet. I used to be the richest man in the world. Now I'm sitting here, looking out at the estate, happier than I've ever been... with next to nothing. Thinking about growing a beard. Mom? You know, when you hit me, it hurt. I mean, it hurts. But it helped me. Have you ever held a baby? Hey? Are we always going to be this old? I don't want to do it alone. I mean, I brought you all the way out here. It's not like I'm the one that needs swimming lessons. And the fact that you're not even trying, well, that baffles me, really. I mean, what are you afraid of? There's no sharks in here. Suppose a water dog comes walking down the tracks and sees you. What's he going to say about you, land dog? I mean, if there's times in the world where it's time to take a chance, it's time right now to take a chance. What's this? Water. Get in it. It's just water. Listen, brother. This river goes two ways. That way... and that way. You know what I'm saying? It's like a puzzle with hands if you think about it. Are you happy now?
