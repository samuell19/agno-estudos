Funeral at noon More salt? No, it's fine. I wish I'd come to lunch. Everything was good. Was there was a lot of work? Yes, loads. Okay. What did you do today? I went to the post office. Hasn't it closed down? Yes, I forgot. Schmerling is dead. Who? Esther Schmerling. She was one of the old residents here. I don't think you ever met her. She died last night. She was unhappy. She was really old I She taught me at school. Was she your teacher? I remember, even before the building was built, she drove us into the grove and translated books from German for us. She always said that in German a dog doesn't bark woof-woof, but elf-elf. She didn't care what she told us For 50 years, Esther Schmerling trained several generations of Jewish workers, engineers, soldiers. Only a few of them are still here. No one can appreciate the severity of our loss. Thank you for enabling students to walk alongside you and not behind you. You put all your strength into education. You were a real educator. A teacher of life. Hello. Are you at home? Yes. Will you be home for a while? Yes. I have to take the baby to the doctor. He hurt himself again. Maybe you can cook Iftah something to eat? Something simple. I haven't had time. Are you OK? I'm good, Thanks. Thanks. Did you study with Esther Schmerling? What was she like? As good a teacher as anyone else. What happened to your brother? He hit his head on the door. It's hot today. Do you want to see something? Beautiful, isn't it? Want to see where I found it? Let's go there. I'm not allowed to come here. Have you ever been here? No. Don't worry, nobody's here. Come on, I'll look after you. I saw you, boy. Why aren't you with everyone else? Where's your camp? Behind the citrus plantation. I've never seen it. That's because it's classified. Is he the one who lost the jar? I think your mother is already home. Are you hungry? I spoke with Ostrovsky, the school principal. He said they are looking for a replacement for Schmerling. I want you to take her place. Me, work as a teacher? Yes. Did my parents ask you to do this? Do what? Get me a job? No, no, not at all. I haven't finished my specialist training. But, you do have a diploma? I don't know, I have something. Where? I don't know. Maybe it's in the pantry. Let's go look. Maybe my parents have it. "Teachers Diploma" I will write to them to send it. Is that it? Yes. I'll arrange a meeting for you with Ostrovsky. Isn't it better if you raise your legs? Get ready! 21, 22, 23. Attack!!! Grenade! What's that? 21, 22, 23. Attack! Go ahead! Advance! Advance! Advance! Advance! He's probably not here? Who's going to volunteer? Come on. I'll go. Again? What going on? You stay behind to collect everything. We brought you something. For me? What is it? It's delicious, drink it. Did you lose your flask? What flask? This one. No, no, not me. Thanks. For the present? Yes. Will you continue training here? No, we're done here. And what will you do? Tomorrow we'll clean the weapons, get together and... and leave here, thank God! Come on, Beni. We need to go. Yes? Hello, Mr. Ostrovsky. Hello. Can I? Of course. Come on in. Take a seat. Hello. Hello. Would you like something to drink? No, no thanks. Have you brought any papers? Anything I can look at? Yes. You studied at a teachers workshop. Yes, she graduated with honours. Perfect. I hope it's not adequate? Yes. Are you available now? I'm happy to help everyone I can but there are things I don't remember. OK, but she has kept all her training stuff, so... Do you have experience with children? Yes, she has experience. Can you leave us alone for a while? Yes. Look, we have a month left before the summer holidays. I need you to take a class for a month. Do you think you can work with the class? I've barely hardly heard you speak. I'll be glad to help. OK, then get up. Please stand up. Do you want to work? Do you want to do this? Then get up. Imagine that you have a class that won't stop making noise. You enter the classroom and shout "I'm here". I'm here. I can't hear you. Louder. I'm here. Louder. I'm here. Louder! So they can hear you! I'm here! Louder! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I've been accepted. Really? Yes. Wonderful! Wonderful! Are you hungry? ' No. Do you want a shower? A shower? Yes, go wash, It will make you feel better. What? Did you say something? No. I thought you said something. Go take a shower. Get some rest. Apparently, I'll be your teacher. What happened?

An insect is a creature with an exoskeleton. On Wednesday, at the end of the day. Go to the library on the second floor. A copy of the Pedagogical Poem will be waiting for you there. A teacher's gift. Wait for me here. I'm here. Your substitute teacher, Ms. Erlich is waiting for you outside. She won't come in until you are absolutely silent Is that clear? Hello. I'm Hagar, Hagar Erlich. I'm here instead of Esther. I hope we'll be able to spend time together. Thank you... Thank you very much. Hagar Today we'll learn a new verse. You can sit down. Do any of you know who Lea Goldberg is? We will learn her verse 'White Days' It was written a very long time ago, but, in my opinion, it's still relevant. These white days are so long like the sun's rays. Loneliness is great, like a large body of water. A window is looking at the sky, and the wide sky is silent. And the bridges span between yesterday and tomorrow. My heart got used to me and tempered my ardour reconciled and the blows became calmer to consider like a baby that purrs and closes his eyes, because the tired mother fell asleep and sang. How easy it is for me to go, my white days, to your inaudible call! Learned to laugh eyes, asking for nothing, The bridges are great and beautiful between yesterday and tomorrow. Iftah? Iftah? Iftah? Hey! Are you looking for the boy? Have you seen him? He was here earlier. I know where he is. Let's go. Is he your son? What? I asked if he's your son? Why? Do I look that old? No, I just asked. He's not my son. Have we gone too far? No. I was looking for you yesterday. Me? Yes. I thought you'd be walking here. Did you enjoy it? It was amazing. Really? Yes. The children are very cute. You coped? It was a little difficult at first, but... everything worked out. I knew. I knew you could do it. You are much stronger than you think. Significantly stronger. Yes. What's that? What? Can't you hear it? Don't you recognise it? What are you doing? Madam? Hagar. Hagar. Get up Where's Iftah? I don't know. Have you seen him? No. He always dawdles somewhere, but he's never been this late. Are you sure you haven't seen him? No, I'm sorry. Sarah, let's go search. Are you sure you haven't see him? Are you sure? Try to remember. No, I haven't seen him. Sarah, lets go. We'll go through everything. We'll find him. I'm sure he's nearby. Are you going to school? Yes. Why didn't you tell me you were hanging around with Iftah. He always follow me, that's all. But why didn't you tell me? What was there to say? What was there to say? Why is she so mad at you? I don't know. Sorry, where is everyone? There's no school today, madam. Everyone is looking for the missing child. Where's Iftah? What was there to say?I don't know. Where is he?
