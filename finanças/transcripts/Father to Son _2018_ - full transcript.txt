Van Pao-Te. Van Pao-Te. Your mother-in-law is talking, but you just turn a deaf ear. Mom. Why have you got a gun? That's funny, Mom. I'm going downtown. There's a water leak at Doc's. And that's more important? What about my bathroom? Registration is in a week. Have you decided yet? There's 80 square meters behind that bathroom. No title deeds. What if she gets elected? I served six terms. - Where will I take a bath? - Mom, have some pigs’ feet. I don't want pigs' feet. I want pigskin. No pigskin today. These clothes need dry cleaning. Dy-Chi can take them. Why bring them over here? Their service is better. Mom, I'm leaving. Yasu! If you don't register... I'm going to run again! Dad. Could you invent a smog alarm for him? It'd be faster if you wrote him an App. Look. It's sixty years old. Really tough. Show me. It's heavy! Same age as us! Would've been drafted the same year! I'll come back tomorrow. Tell your nurses... not to use the water trough today. What's up? Wait! Slowly, slowly. Steady! Two more. Steady. Almost there. Come on. I've got you. Slowly. Let's give you a check-up. - I don’t go to doctors. - I know. I'm not Doc, just your classmate. A-Chen! - What's up? - Come here! What happened? I'm allergic to doctors. A-Chen, you can go for lunch now. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out. And again. Have you heard? Mei is sick. Really? Cancer. She’s started chemotherapy. Chemotherapy? Ah, she’s been wearing a hat lately. Lost her hair. Hello, Tiffany Laundry. (Tiffany Laundry) (Yung-Hsing Hotel) That's not a job for the boss. Where's A-Ti? Off duty already. You're too good to him. Both machines broke down? We've been washing all day. Both motors are giving up. So temperamental. Leave it to me and A-Kuan. We'll do it. Thanks a lot. Here's your new coupons. At your service... Thanks. Ku, good job you're here. (A-Kao Fruit Store) - Don't answer that. - I have to. It's the bosslady. Look at the time. It's the middle of the night. Dad, hurry up. Okay. Don't push me. Five-eight-three. Calling five-eight-three. Bad news. That thermal tank idea you had… someone is already doing it, over. This one’s also made in Japan? Taiwan. Can I take a look? Why do you want to take a look? Hold on. Today, your stool color… still the same? I'm giving you a phone number. My classmate. She's at NTU Hospital. Find some time to see her in Taipei. Why? You ask me why? She was our class belle. Very pretty. Class belle? I know what he meant... He said the same thing twenty years ago. Mrs Van, don't worry. I'll give Yasu another doctor's number. He'll take you. Why? Why? Nothing, he was my teacher. And very good-looking! Really? You never went to a clinic? Never saw a doctor? I was there to fix the water pump. Not cos I was feeling sick. Then I am not like you. Whenever I go to a clinic... the smell always gives me a headache. A-Kao... Doc said I needed to check my pancreas. Just ignore him. Everyone has something in their pancreas. From my lungs to my intestines… there's always something. Those guys are all the same. They're always bluffing. The more frightened you are... the more money they can make. A-Kao. Where is the pancreas? Pancreas? Inside the belly! (Doc's Clinic) Girlfriend? Yeah. Won't leave me alone. You're kidding? Really? What's the problem? My back hurts. Kidneys? Pancreas, maybe. Pancreas? Not Internal Medicine? Gastroenterology? Go ask Dr. Hsu for me. I'll go ask at Doc’s. Yasu isn't faking it. I'll complete the registration and run myself. Vote Chuang Su-Ju! My daughter. She's running this year. Vote Chuang Su-Ju! Vote Kuo Yu-Chin! Mei. I'm here. Nico! Were you always that tall or have you grown? C'mon, I'm just the same. Just like you. - Are you tired? - A little bit. In 1987, I failed the college entrance exam. Mom told me to come down and help with her hotel and prepare to retake. When I arrived... the boys here, just like bored guys at the pool... surprised by sudden ripples in the water all turning to see what made the splash. Me? I didn't care about them at all. Thinking I was nothing but a passerby doing my time and leaving. Dad, I'm going out. Be right back. That was my first time here. How did you find that? I'd left this place behind ten years before. I thought I'd have nothing more to do with this town... but my aunt and uncle... were in an accident... and left the hotel behind. Nobody knew what to do. They didn't have any kids. My mom wanted to sell it. But I just couldn't. So I decided to come back and run it. That's what I don't understand. You're not even from here. I have feelings for this hotel. You said you came here twice but why did you leave in the first place? My dad and brother didn't want me to come back. Why not? I caused trouble here before. Dad, I'll go fetch grandma's clothes. The receipt. The laundry? I'll go. You stay here. I can go, you stay here. You stay here. I'll go. You go. I'll stay. I'll stay. This is my niece, Nico. From Taipei. No experience at all has never done business. So look out for her. Where are you going? To Taipei... to fix this. Got it? Anybody there? Aren't you… working at the hotel? Oh, I was just helping my friend with the bed sheets. Just helping out. What are you looking for? Do you have this kind of cable? Nope. It's okay, thanks. Wait a second. Just a second. This one, right? - How much? - It’s free. - Free? - I've got loads of them. One thing to remember... there are two connectors. You go and try this first. If it doesn't work come back. I'll give you a different one. Seriously, I've got loads. - Thanks. - You're welcome. We eat… what we like. Wanna drink? Then drink. A smoke? Healthy living is only the half of it. We have to be mentally happy as well. Mei is going to be okay, right? I know it looks serious. But this time... I guarantee you she'll be all right. What do you know? Her mom was sick, too. The old lady just didn't let anyone know. You know we got together, huh? I only know the Stained Pants Incident. You're only happy when you're teasing me. After that there was a miracle. Her mom's tumor just disappeared. So I've been thinking the whole family must have a strong constitution. A strong constitution? Think about her mom. She passed away just a few years ago. Both her parents lived into their eighties. How old is Mei? Only in her fifties. She'll be fine. A-Kao. What about me? With you, I’m not sure. Your mom lived to sixty. That's a bit short. But you've got your father's genes. If he's still alive... he'll be ninety years old? Almost ninety. Have you heard from him? President A-Kao! The Scientist! Long time, no see. - Inventor! - What's the difference? Science. Art. The inventor sits in between. Both scientist and artist. No! Neither scientist nor artist. You stay with the scientist. You take this piece of fruit. I need to have a word. Take good care of him. Make him happy. What have you invented? Nothing. Come on, tell me. Nothing. Really. How old are you? Sixty. You don't look it. Your friend does, but you don't. He's not sixty yet. Feeeeeel... Soooo... Aliiive!!! Happy? Happy. I told you. Better treatment than you'll get in any hospital. Your girl was so hot. How many times? None. Since you're an inventor... I reckon you should invent... a special pill for yourself. I didn't need a pill. I just didn't wanna do it. What are you talking about? I meant a suicide pill. In many countries… they give their soldiers a single suicide pill. And as a result... this has an unexpected effect. Huh? If people… are in charge of their own death... they become very, very brave. A-Te, you going to Taipei? I'm going to meet the Premier. The Premier? How come? No big deal. We were in a competition in Japan. Now the Premier wants to meet us. Fantastic! Meeting the Premier... I bet you couldn't sleep last night. I could. I didn't sleep a wink. I had a nightmare. So scary. I was a kid, standing next to a fish pool… waiting for a bus. But the bus never came. It was getting darker and darker... and the pool started to flood. I was so scared. In the end, I didn't know if I was waiting for a bus or a person. I just kept crying. You went to a competition in Japan! Not bad. My whole life… I've never been abroad. Today… with the gold medal winners… from seven international invention exhibitions… gathered together... I feel great admiration for you… and am thankful for your efforts. Through creativity we can make up for such deficiencies. And this kind of spirit… embodies our most important of assets. Mr. Van. We couldn't reach you. Your details seem out of date. A Japanese company is interested. Your email, please. Here, please. I just got off the train. I'm walking out. You must be tired. I'm fine. By the way, Mei from the laundry... is getting treatment in Taipei. She’s sending her niece here to take care of the laundry. Says she's a real character. Was taking liberal arts but now she’s dropped out. Plans to transfer to science. She just broke up with her boyfriend... cos he was too childish. She has a cat... but cos it's not convenient... she's left it in Taipei. Why are you telling me all this? I want to go to Japan. Why not just slow down for a while. You need to go for a proper examination. And I looked it up. Pancreatic diseases often suddenly get worse. How’s the coding going? We can work online for the time being. So when are you going to Taipei? It's not urgent. I can take my time. Just leave when you have to. Don't wait around here. Dad. Actually... I'm not afraid of you dying... I'm afraid of you suffering. I appreciate that. I remembered A-Kao's words. What makes people brave? Being in charge of life or being in charge of death? What kind of pill would do that? I made something twenty-nine years ago... I thought would fix my fear of death forever. But, am I really not afraid to die? I had my first cigarette here at the age of thirteen. My first sexual experience, at the age of sixteen also here. Doc asked me what it was like. I answered... It is what it is. It is what it is. It is what it is. Cousin! Sorry. I kept you waiting. Come in, come in. You remember, I'd just passed the Bar Exam... got lots of gifts... including four pairs of shoes. One pair was from you. Remember? I've worn out the other three pairs. But the ones you gave me... dark brown, ankle boots... I dared not wear them. In the whole family... your approach is the most up-to-date. Living wills are common in the West... while in Taiwan they are still rare. If you want to have one, I'll back you up. (Patents) (Certificate of Deposit) (In Japanese) Four eels, one kilo in total. That’s the maximum. 1.1 or 1.2 kilos, like before… isn't acceptable. It's because of flight delays. Wait a second. Really? So during the flight… baby chicks hatch from their eggs? - They’ll keep growing, no matter where they are. - Even with delays… the weight needs to be accurate. Never mind. Mr Huang, we require... Four eels, one kilo in total. Non-negotiable. Leave it to me. They'll be no problems. Compared with the flights issue... Compared with the flights issue... your priority should be sourcing more eel farms to ensure a reliable supply. You have only one farm now, right? Excuse me. I couldn't help hearing your conversation. One of my relatives happens to have an eel farm. If you don't mind... I could introduce him to you. I meant no disrespect. Sorry to have interrupted you. Please... Who's that? Your friend? Where are you from? Taiwan. Taiwanese... You don’t know any eel farmers, do you. You want to do business. You've got balls. Your Japanese isn't bad. Wanna make some money in Japan? You just don't get it! Why can't you understand? Somebody has to take care of this family. I did my part. After my dad left us... his boss felt sorry for my mom and me. He introduced my mom to the Huang's where she became a housemaid. We lived there for nine years. Mrs. Huang is Japanese. I got the name Yasu from the Huangs. If you get elected... don't pick on my mother-in-law. Not a word in ten years... and that's what you say to me. I heard you're sick. All right. Why would I pick on her? No, you wouldn't. You're not afraid of being seen here? I'm here for A-Kuan. Why do you want to see her? Thirty years ago... she wanted to give me an address. I didn't take it. I want to ask her if she still has it. Forty years ago... A-Kuan replaced my mother and became their housemaid. When Yu-Chin came back to deal with the hotel A-Kuan came here to work for her. A-Ti says you're sick? Maybe. I don't feel great. All of a sudden you want this address. Is it cos you're sick? Don't be afraid. Adversity can be overcome. Through strength, one will prevail. I know. Got a cigarette? Is it really so important for a son to see his father? I should go. Hello? Hi, Van. It's Auntie. Auntie. Less than a month to go. What do you mean? - Didn't you want to check out the elections in Taiwan? - Did I really say that? Auntie is old now. There's nobody to help with the campaign. You're not my auntie. My auntie would never say that. - It's just a short flight from Hong Kong. Come over. - When? As soon as possible. Weird. It's already the 20th. We haven't received the tickets yet. November 20th? If your grandpa is still alive today’s his 90th birthday. I thought you'd forgotten already. Speak of the devil... Zoom in. I don't get it. Why don't you take your cousin along? Going without a lawyer... The Japanese are very careful people. Don't sign any contracts. - If he goes with us, you'll miss out on his vote. - He’ll definitely vote for me. So will Dy-Chi. But you… I'm not so sure. Five-eight-three calling zero-seven-seven... All set. Come and get the luggage. Over. Zero-seven-seven. Copy that. Over. This bag, too? Hat, scarf, gloves. All with you? Mom... I hope you get elected. Get elected my ass. Hello, bosslady. Bosslady. I've picked up Van. Yeah, I've got him. Okay. Sorry for the noise. Take a nap. Sorry. I'll be there in 15 minutes. See you in front of the temple. Let's go. Pretty big. Auntie has prepared all your favorites. It’s really okay not to answer that? It's fine. The election's not so important. What matters is that you're finally here. I'm Ken Honda from Technical Development. Our company is interested in harnessing... the energy generated by... various mechanical and bio-mechanical activities. Are you familiar with traditional Chinese medicine? No, I'm not. You speak Japanese? Just a little. I was deeply impressed by your work at the invention exhibition. And I researched the patents you have applied for. No disrespect, I was just curious. I found your systems… bear a striking resemblance to the meridian system of the body. He said your designs remind him of the meridian system of the body. I don't know anything about traditional Chinese medicine. I focus on circulation. Circulation? Circulation. Conservation of energy. It's all about circulation. Do you mind if I smoke? No. Please. Excuse me. Thanks. Don't smoke. I must say, your App is quite good. Thank you. He said you're an excellent App writer. Yeah, right. Thanks. I never knew the bosslady was from Hong Kong. She isn't. Only I am from Hong Kong. My father is her brother. They are both Taiwanese. I was born in Hong Kong, so I'm a Hongkonger. - What about your mother? - British. I knew it. I told my dad you're mixed-blood! I'm not mixed-blood. My mother is originally from Hong Kong. In 1997, she applied for a British passport. So she became British. Whatever... Van... you are my first foreign friend. And I'm gonna show you a great time! Call me Newman, not Van. Only Auntie calls me Van. That's what she always does. I've got my own name. But she insists on calling me A-Ti. And so now, everyone calls me A-Ti. Welcome. Over there, please. Welcome. May I take your order? A cup of coffee. A glass of orange juice and a cup of coffee. Wait. Coffee. So two cups of coffee? Got it. I'll bring them shortly. Welcome. Please take a seat. Mr. Van? This is my son. My name is Asai. Have a seat, please. I'll sit here. You look like your father. I'm very happy to meet you. I want to ask you about my father. But... I might not have the answers you want. Cafe au lait. Do you know what he did for a living? A construction worker. Mr. Van, you will be 60 this year? The years fly by. That's a bit sad. So, your father. A construction worker. Involved in many important projects in Tokyo. Fifty years have passed. Is that true? He was a construction worker? Please enjoy. He was a bodyguard... Oh no... Your father was a broker. Introducing young ladies from Taiwan to Kabukicho. A bodyguard? A broker? A broker. In our club, many of our hostesses came from Taiwan. He was especially nice to me. However... When he found out being with me... wouldn't get him a Japanese passport... he disappeared. Running away with an American girl. Anna. But Anna had her own story, too. She thought your father was Japanese. Who knew that… your father was seeing Anna… cos he wanted an American passport. Is he… still alive? I don't know. The last thing I heard… he'd run off to China. Back then, the Japanese economy was on the rise. Many Taiwanese came here to work in construction. Hard times. He made a great contribution to Japan's economy. Miss Asai met him at the construction site. She adored him. But your grandpa told her... he already had a family in Taiwan. Good day. Welcome. This way, please. Slippers, please. You remember... when you and mom were fighting a lot. You wanted to leave us, didn't you? There was one night... it was very quiet... You thought I was asleep. You came to my bedside... and whispered something. Although you spoke in a really low voice... I've never forgotten what you said. You said... Somebody had to take care of the family. You'd done your part. I hid in my quilt... watching you get your bag and leave. I heard you walk out. I kept crying, but I daren't make a sound. But then I heard you come back in. Why? (He was a broker) (He sold Taiwanese girls to the clubs in Kabukicho) Today on the train... telling me about grandpa in Japan... I realized something. You weren't heartless enough. And so, because of that... you spent your whole life in a no-hope town… mucking around with stuff… pretending you were an inventor. You couldn't be like your father. Just up and leave. First Japan. Then the USA. Then China. Just following the money. Because of this... I won't leave you behind. Wind clears, mist dispersed Fleeting glimpses, ebb and flow The words unsaid, still wanna hear? While the answer lies, in the riddle A day, a year Not seeing, not missing Paths crossed, without sparks Searching for days, you in the mirror Turning to look, you’re in my heart Twelve times. You know how many times it repeats? Floating around… Here and there. I'd like to wash these. Phone number? 6-9-4-7-5-1-3-0. (Master of The Future by LO TaYou) Twelve times. Afghanistan. An Afghan stamp. You collect stamps? Just started. Any themes? Theme? Cats! Do you know the singer used to be a doctor? Gear wheels. Oh, gear wheels! I like stamps with gear wheel themes. So you collect stamps, too. I read a series of American novels and began to collect stamps. American novels? Among the doctors I know... only he can write something… so abstract. - Lawrence Block! - Lawrence Block! Stories from the past that you want to hear… hide in the future. Don't panic... The Smoke Gets In Your Eyes... Or maybe, all the stories from the future… hide in the past. What kind of trouble did you cause here? Nothing worth talking about. The point is, I came back... and stayed. The Smoke Gets In Your Eyes... The heart affects the kidneys… and impairs kidney function. The kidneys affect the lungs… and...er...cause…er... Now take your medicine. President A-Kao! May I take some of girls with me for a while. Please. The other rooms are complaining! You’ve got all my girls here! Please. Okay? No-one's going anywhere! I’m sorry, one of our regular clients… has booked all my girls tonight. I brought my Hong Kong friend especially… Don’t do this to me! Fuck! - You can’t! - Let me in! That's my dad! Fuck! Put the knife away! Five-eight-three. Calling five-eight-three. Bad news. They're getting away. Call downstairs! Don't let them leave. Wait. Please. Help me... get a message… to my son. No... No... Enough. If I go on... I'll just become another you. Don't die! Actually, I know that after my death… all the stories move on... just without me. Is it sad? I came up with two options: Firstly... if this is a math question... If you have one pencil in a box... then you take away that pencil... To that pencil box... before I'm put in... and after I'm taken away... The difference is zero. Secondly... if this is a chemistry question... then… I'm like a hot pepper, boiled in oil… and then scooped up. I've changed... The oil has changed, too. Anybody there? Hello neighbor, we are closed today. I'm in the toilet right now. Just take what you need and pay me later. Thanks. It's you. What's up? Your father had a message for you. Why didn't you tell me in the police station? Because, I'm not sure… if it's important or not. But since I promised him... He wanted me to tell you... He came back... because of money. He didn't take enough. I should go. I don't know if the message is important. He doesn't know how much it means to me. I'm not sure if I remembered it correctly. It's exactly what Dad would've said. I can't figure it out. Add the rice wine, cook off the alcohol. Why doesn't it change back to water? Water? You know you can't give her water. Alcohol plus water, minus alcohol... Hot pepper plus oil, minus hot pepper... Chicken plus water, minus chicken... (1988. The state funeral of late President, Chiang Ching-Kuo) Kiddo. Sleep. Kiddo, do you understand the concept of… physical and chemical change? Water freezes, becomes ice. Ice melts, returns to water. These reversible changes we classify as physical changes. But an egg in hot oil? It's gets transformed! When that egg cools down... it can’t change back. This kind of irreversible change… we classify as chemical change. Now... he performs for me again. Protecting the heart... by pretending to have no heart. Five-eight-three. Calling five-eight-three. Where did you come from? Why did you choose this house? You know... since you were born… I have been transformed. No turning back. No turning back. Calling five-eight-three. Keep the heart out of it. Copy that. Over.
