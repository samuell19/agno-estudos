PRESENTED BY NEW PRODUCED BY JOY RABBIT On August 15, 1945, Korea is liberated from Japanese rule. But the peninsula soon divides along the 38th parallel line, due to influences of US and Soviet Union. Communist and democratic governments clashed endlessly, and the Korean War began on June 25, 1950. August, 1951 Stay alert, men! Return fire! Lieutenant! Lieutenant... My belly's too hot. Am I going to die? You'll survive, so be quiet. - Mom... - Medic! - I want to see my mom. - Medic! I miss her, I need mom. Shut your mouth! You'll live! Lieutenant! Our plan backfired! Conserve ammo until air raid begins! - Aimed shots! - Aimed shots! I'll recon the area! - Cover fire! - Cover fire! Sgt. Jo! Stay back! Sang-ryul! Get on my back! - Ready grenade! - Ready grenade! - Throw! - Throw! - Ready bayonet! - Ready bayonet! Sons of bitches... It's too late, dammit! - Sooni! - What? Nothing. I'll do it. - You okay? - I'm fine. Why're you grinning? We get to eat rice and beef today. It's for mom's memorial ceremony. Aren't you even sad? I am. But I can't help it when I think about beef. Mommy, I'm sorry. You are right, she'll be happy that you're eating well. But I'll try not to look too happy. How's the memorial prep going? It's daddy! Daddy! - Welcome home! - Yes, son. Tada! It's a kite! - Like it? - I love it! It goes so high! Look, it's Choon-sik. You did a real man's work! Go away! - You okay? - I'm fine. Are you nuts?! Choon-sik, what's wrong? You commies! What? Raise the red flag up high, and proudly shout, we're not afraid of guillotine! This is my farewell song Dong-gu, what's a 'guillotine'? Listen. Do you remember how dad butchered a chicken? Yeah, he snapped its neck. - And then? - Then... Chopped it off with a knife. Right! That's a guillotine. What's with Choon-sik? Why won't he play with us? You idiot. Your dad ratted out his brother to the North Koreans. Don't say that! Don't tell me what to do! Choon-sik's brother is a toast! Toast? I'm getting hungry. How long must we keep this up? We even got kids on this. We must do whatever it takes to survive. We gotta stay alive for the kids to live. Dang it, another change? Out! - Good afternoon. - Where are you heading? Check the back. Now! What's going on? Stay put. What are you doing here? We were singing. Singing? Could I hear some? Raise the red flag... Arrest them. We're in trouble, it's all your fault. What? Why? I'll be transferred to the rear line soon. Medical discharge after then? Yes, probably. Please stay alive. I'll repay you for saving my life. Come here, you commies! Please let me go just this once! Come, come! Dong-gu! Dad! Dad! Dad! Get them out of here! Take the kids away! I'm okay. It's all my fault! Don't ever get separated! Dong-gu! Always hold her hand! Don't ever let go! This man is a communist! As if teaching commie songs to his kids weren't enough, he used them to spread propaganda! We can't let this slide. And you?! You're no better than I! I sang communist song in front of commies, and army song in front of South Korean army! All for the sake of survival! I'm not doing this for myself! Then, why did you have my son killed? Who made him into a commie bullet sponge? They put a gun in my mouth, I just lost it. For the sake of my kids, please don't kill me. You damn commie! We must make an example! Once you become a commie, you can never go back! Never! What? What! Are there commie sympathizers? Why're you hesitating?! Please, don't kill me. Those who hesitate are all commies! Hit him! Hit him! Daddy! Dad! Sir, please save my dad! I'll do anything! Help him! Please save him! I need to practice some more. Wait, please. Wait a minute. Spare my family, I'll do anything. I'll join North Korean army if you want. My sister is only 15 now. I'll do anything, okay? Sang-mi, look at me. I'm... so scared... Nothing's gonna happen. It's all right. Help him! Please! Help him! Dad! Dad! I'll kill anyone who hurts my dad! I'll kill you! Daddy... He's bleeding. Medicine! Bring us some medicine! Please help us! Dad! Brother, where are we going? Dad said to head south if something happened. Brother. What? I heard you become a star when you die. Is that true? That's crap. Then all those are dead people? It'd be so scary To look up the sky. Star is a star, and dead people go to heaven. Then mom and dad will never see us? They come during memorial ceremony. Right. Brother, could you sing me a song? I'll sleep better. Yeah? The sun has set, but no one's coming Staring into the bright moon, the yearning deepens A MELODY TO REMEMBER 1952, Busan This way. Colonel's over there. Put him in. Salute! Salute! New transferee Lt. Han Sang-ryul reporting! Majored music in college... Sit. Yes, sir. Do you like kids? Pardon? Upon HQ's order, we built an orphanage. It's a good cause, but why in the base? It's run by volunteers, but it needs a manager. Someone recommended you. Salute! Sgt. Jo? - How have you been? - Sergeant! But how... I decided to stay. Can't do much with this leg in the outside world anyway. I get respect for war experience too. And made me an MP. So... you're the one who recommended me? Yes. I thought of you when the spot opened up. Busan is the safest place. It's here. Why isn't anyone here? That's the orphanage. See that flag? UN built this place. That's the church. It's magnificent. And that barrack is your new home. What is my duty here? Well, you can ask the headmaster. It's a gramophone. Ah, that. Your transfer gift. You didn't have to. I know you love music. Thank you. You should be, let's go outside. I got you a holiday pass till Sunday, so rest up. Here. It's been a while since I last saw a crowd. 700k refugees in a city meant for 400k. Go line up! Get in line! Give me some more! In a single line! There she is, the headmaster. See the bright-faced lady? Thank you. Take care. She studied abroad, and now she volunteers. Strange girl. Good afternoon! Hello there. Hi! Lt. HAN Sang-ryul? Hello, I'm PARK Ju-mi. Lt. HAN Sang-ryul, ma'am. Thank you for coming all this way. - Have you had lunch? - Yes, we did. Hey! You little punk! That's my medical bag! Let go! Let me go! Wait a minute! Wait! Lt. Han, where are you going?! What's this? Hey. What are you doing? Forgot to tell me? Thought you could hide it from me? You bastards. What are you doing to these kids? They must be punished for what they did. No food for you today. - Get up, it's okay. - Let them be. My boys didn't know this belonged to you. Here's the bag, take it back. You ordered them to do it. No, Ju-mi. I only tell them one thing: earn your keep. Right? Have I ever asked you to steal? Children, listen to me. Steal plenty, eat well, and don't get caught. If you don't want to, come to me. You know where to find me. Ju-mi, I have feelings too. Do I lock them up? Look here. If you want to go, feel free to go. Go away! Just go, you thieves! Don't hurt the children! You okay? Sgt. Jo, good to see you. Come on, get up. Sgt. Jo, what is this place? I don't believe this. It's where people live. - Sgt. Jo? - Yes? Why do kids live there? Do you know how many war orphans there are? - About 100,000. - That much? Unfortunately. The resources to look after them are too limited. I'm heading back to the base, what'll you too do? Isn't it obvious? Get drunk. He's on holiday leave anyway. That sounds so good, I want to have fun too. - Ms. Park? - Yes? Why're you so happy? What? Pardon me for saying so, but our country's turned into a massive grave. Sorry... Kids should be back from school. I'll head back now. Why are you so prickly? She's a good person. Let's drink. - So pure... - Which way? Right, over there. Here, this way. Drink slowly, this is expensive stuff... You finished it... Sergeant, order another. Sure, of course. You bastard! Watch your tone, bastard! I got a dog your age back home! What's this called? Give me another bottle. Lieutenant, thank you for the performance. Daddy? Daddy! Ju-won! I'm so sorry. He's not daddy, does he look similar? Shall we greet him? Lt. Han will be living with us. - Hello! - Hello! Mister! Give me a hug. I'll, uh, head to my barrack. Hug me! Hug me! Young-hee! - Bring your brother! - Okay! Wu-tak, brush your teeth! You'll get cavities! Gonna wash up? Yup. Let's make a tiger! Roar, roar, roar! Good morning. Finally up? Didn't think you'd ever wake up. I didn't get to introduce myself before. I'm nanny Park So-dam. Hello there. If you have questions, ask me anything. What do I have to do while I'm stationed here? That's for you to figure out. Since you're here to manage. What? Let's make a tiger, roar, roar, roar! Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight, rolls a melody sweeter than psalm In celestial like strains it unceasingly falls, o'er my soul like an infinite calm Peace, wonderful peace Coming down from the Father above Sweep over my spirit forever... What's going on? Well... A skirmish broke out near Ulsan. It's over and we're transferring POWs. It's nothing at all, so go rest. Okay. May I come with you? I haven't got much to do here. Private, load that supply truck, and rest of you get ready to transfer POWs. - Casualties? - 8, sir. Look into their home regiment. Why aren't the POWs tied up? Are they going on a picnic? Tie them up! GIs have tons to take, but nothing here! Keep it down! Search thoroughly, there's gotta be something. It's a gold tooth! - Dong-gu. - What? This shell is so big! It's a dud. I'll remove the cover and get the copper inside, we can buy 100 candies. - Seriously? - Yeah. Hooray for Democratic Republic of People's Army! Hooray! Hooray! Look at those brainwashed bastards. It stank so bad! Does he work here? Well... he does odds and ends here. Those look like military supplies. I'm so hungover, let's go get some food. Hungry and hungover. Hook was originally one of colonel's men. He was a soldier? Yes. He lost his arm in battle, so the colonel took pity on him and began giving him jobs. See those suits? They're all from Seoul, they used connection to skip the draft. They live on a boat so they can bail anytime. They're sons of pro-Japanese faction. Hook began working with them, so he's invincible. Not even the colonel can do anything. Mr. Hook. Yes, young master. Get me some gasoline. The demand is huge. That's impossible, even with US dollar. It's in the base, practically littered there. Those aren't regular supplies, it's military vitals. I could get killed for messing with it. Why did you say that? Huh? You spoke halfheartedly. Did I really? I'm talking about giving you a lifeline, but you just shrug it off? You make me sound like a selfish prick. - Mr. Hook. - Yes? Can you live without me? Freaking bastard! I asked you a question. Okay, I'll give it a try. I'll find a way, anything's possible in Korea. See? Those who don't even try are the real cripples. - Mr. Hook. - Yes? I didn't say that because of your hand. Get some and I'll pay you 2-3 times more. Sure. Come here. Am I funny? A comedian? Come here! Do you know what this hand means? I traded my hand for this country! Hooray for Korea! Leave Busan at once. If I ever see you again, I will rip your head off. Buzz off, now! Buzz off! What are you looking at?! Get to work! Go on! Flowers for sale! Please buy some! Please enjoy. Brother. Where is it from? - Did you steal it? - Of course not! I picked it up off the ground. It still has dirt on it. You're not a beggar, I told you I'd buy it for you! But you never did. Dad bought stuff for me right away. Shut it! Get it through your head! He's dead! He doesn't exist! I know! I do! Can't I say I miss him? I know I can't see him... I want to say I miss him. Don't cry. I'm sorry. You must be tired, come sit down. Could you clean my boots? Okay. Put it here? Here, make it extra special clean. Il-hwan! Come have some bean bread! Right after this! Hey! What are you doing?! Salvaging copper. Are you nuts?! Stop that! Why? I found this. It's dangerous! Il-hwan!! Il-hwan! Holy cow! You want to start a choir? Yes, sir War orphans were plenty during WW2 in other countries. Many children's choirs were formed then. Why? To console the children's sorrow. So if we... If we start a choir, we can take in street kids, and protect them in the base. With enough practice, they could entertain the troops, and the talented ones could have new hope. No, there's no budget. I'll take care of that, no matter what. What if spies infiltrate? This is a military base. Come on, colonel, they're just kids. They'll do anything for a little food. You could turn a commie into an anticommunist. Oh yeah! Know what they did first when they took over Seoul? They gathered kids and got them to sing propaganda. We can't use songs for propaganda. Then what? Feed them? Choir as a pretext? In any case, here's what I think. This is a no-lose case for you too. Let's say President Rhee came here. The brats sing for him, then what'd happen? "Who are they?" he would ask, right? "They're war orphans," you'd answer. Then what? "What an amazing idea to start a choir!" "Thanks to the colonel's support, we turned orphans into a choir." How would he respond? "As you can see, soldiers must protect even the helpless children!" "That's army!" "Col. Park, you're a symbol of a real soldier!" That's what he'd say. He really has a way with words. I'm serious! Okay, let's give it a try. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. Very good. Please send all the kids under your care. Sure, I'll do that. I wish my kids nothing but the best. - How close was I? - Like the real thing. Drop your spoon and come on out. The base is forming a choir. I decided to help them. If you know how to sing, raise your hand. They'll give you food and warm beds. Hee-duk, go on. Pheasant! Pheasant! Pheasant, pheasant! That's enough... One pheasant into the pond! Drop to the ground. Be quiet! I've had it, walk in place. One, two! The march song is 'Vanguard song', begin! One, two, three, four! Come together under the flag, courageously march towards our nemesis and wipe them out! Wait, wait. Stop! Stop! Soon-yi, why aren't you singing? I can't sing. If you don't sing, say bye to your brother. Is that okay? Then I won't join the choir. Look at this idiot. Let go. Let go of it. You have to join the choir no matter what. I won't go without her. I'll ask you again, you won't go? I won't. Shall I send you off as a child soldier? You think I won't do it? You just need her? Fine, you prick. Again! Walk in place! Go sit down in order over there. - Got it? - Okay. Choir Audition - Understand? - Yes! Welcome. Stand over here. Introduce yourself. I'm Jung Hee-duk, 10 years old. I'm from Daejeon. Okay. Could you begin? Pheasant! Pheasant! Pheasant! Pheasant! Going on a pheasant hunt! One pheasant... Do re mi fa sol la ti do re mi fa sol la! Thank you. - Ti do! - Enough! Thank you for that. There aren't many good singers. Stand there please. Introduce yourself. I'm Oh Dong-gu, 14 years old. I'm Oh... Soon-yi. 9 years old. Choon-sik! Why are you here? My family... was killed by the commies because of you! Happy?! Enough. Could you start, little girl? I... I can't sing. Then why're you here? I followed my brother here. Dad said never get separated. She's lying! You sing really well! I heard it all! She and Dong-gu sang every commie song there is! They're all commies! No! We're not commies! That's enough. Dong-gu, could you sing for us? My home is a blooming mountain village Peach flower, apricot flower, baby azalea Radiant colors from flower palace I miss the time I played there Flower village, bird village is my old home When the wind blows from the southern green field, weeping wallows begin dancing I miss the time I played there My home is a blooming... Dear Mom and Dad. Tomorrow is the day new students arrive. I'm both excited and frightened. I remember how worried you looked when we parted, but I'll treat them with love that you've given me. Please be healthy, that's all I wish for. I always love you. Young-ho? Can't sleep? Teacher, you're so pretty. Thank you. Wanna sleep with me tonight? These are the new students who will live and sing with us. Welcome applause! Pheasant! Lie down. Yeah? - Comfy? - Yup. Flowers bloomed on this shirt. Ju-mi. Look over there. She's following him like a shadow. Her father was a lieutenant too. I guess she remembers that. You guys play somewhere else. I'll kill you. What happens when a rolling stone hits a stone in the ground? What happens? It, uh... It bleeds, real bad. Yeah! That's what I meant! I will not live with you. Take a hike. Let us be and I won't hurt you. One, two, three four! One, two, three four! One, two, three four! This is called '4/4 time'. With your partner, begin! One, two, three four! One, two, three four! Children, choir practice time! Okay! Do re mi fa sol la ti do! Guk-hwan, Hwa-soon. As soon as neighbor kids came back from school, they danced and said, sol do sol mi re sol do Very good. Soon-yi, and your partner. Two, three! I don't know, I don't know, what ever do you mean? Mi fa sol sol, what is that, sol do sol mi re sol do Why won't you sing? If you keep being stubborn, we'll get kicked out! You have to sing. No. Get up. Come on, get up! You have no right to cry! Stop crying! No, I won't! I'll never sing! Dad died because I sang! If I didn't sing, he wouldn't have died. We'd be tending mom's grave together. And eat delicious food... We can't do that anymore. You idiot, how is that same as this? What if I sing, and you die too? You can't go to heaven... I don't know where that is. I like you, I like being with you. That's why I won't sing, I'll never sing! That teacher's strange. He's strange. He could just play with us. Just play with us. Stop mimicking me, I'm getting sick of it. Is ant delicious? Are you dumb? What were you doing? - Teacher. - Yes? The sky's so pretty. The sky? Yeah, indeed. I'm here. You bastard, what took you so long? Did you put me in the choir to steal gasoline? Yup. Do it right. If not, I'll sell your sister far away. Take it. Stick this in the barrel. Soon-yi! Where have you been? Why aren't you asleep yet? I was watching the stars. Bro, I really miss mom and dad. - Hop on. - I'm heavy. It's okay. If you miss mom and dad so much, just imagine those stars as them. But you said that's not right. I think I was wrong. Looking at the stars, I think of mom and dad too. I think you were right. - Yeah? - Yeah. But why can't we see stars during the day? Do they hate us in the day? Not at all. The sun gets jealous so it hides the stars, but they're always there. Day or night, mom and dad are always watching you. Got it? Mom, dad... Are you well? I don't think... I'm doing very well. Feel my stomach. Tighten your lower stomach. Thank you. The four of you move to the left. And Ji-sook to the right. And... You to the left. Those on the right, raise your hand. You are 'alto'. Alto! Just alto. Remember that note. On the left. - 'Soprano'. - Soprano! Just soprano. Let's try it together, okay? Two, three! What you just heard is called 'harmony'. Colonel! She was so funny. Salute. Did you call for me? About that choir... let's put on a show, with US officers. A choir is nothing without an audience. They're not ready... Please give us a little more time to practice... They don't need to be good, they'll be cute either way. People will get teary just seeing poor orphans. It'll be a tearjerker. Proceed. By the way, colonel. I have a favor to ask you. My kids are living in the orphanage, could I bring them back from time to time? I miss them now that we're apart. Yeah, sure. They're your kids after all, I bet you miss them terribly. Thank you. Hear that? Where should we go for a drink? Pull it properly, buddy. Singing all day made your life easy, eh? Don't frown, I won't let you come back. Mr. Hook! Yes, young master. Don't miss even a drop, you hear me? Kiddo! Come here. You're cute. Hop on. It's okay. Do you want this? Give me a kiss here then. So adorable. Come here! What? Things are going well? - The kids are so beautiful. - They are. So I feel even more terrible. Come on, you're doing a wonderful job. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be teaching these kids. I don't believe this world is a good place. You're getting serious again. The way I look at it, you think too much. Drink this and forget about it. There's no turning back, so forget everything. Here, this will help. It helped me tremendously. It's helping, totally helping. I'll take it for a spin first. No, get help permanently. Everything about USA is big. Sgt. Jo? You're here, come in! - Already got started? - Yup, yup. Sit over here. - You got beer? - Yes, come sit. Okay. Since you're here, it's time for me to go. - Salute! - What? Sergeant... I got a date, you see. I need a wife. Salute! Wait a minute, sergeant... - Please sit. - Okay. I don't believe it... - What's wrong? - It's nothing. - What's nothing? - Nothing's nothing. I'm so sorry, I forgot something... Wait, no, please... Lieutenant. Thanks for letting me borrow such a precious thing... Explain the content to me later, salute! Sergeant! Hey! Jo! It's not mine. You sure? He's pulling my leg. It's hot in here, can't we drink outside? Sure. He says it helps quite a bit. I get it, whatever. Holy cow! I'm exhausted. I wanted to say that out loud. So exhausting, I'm so tired. Don't mention that to the kids. When are you exhausted the most? When I miss my parents. How bad would it be for the kids? I have a question. What made you want to volunteer? I heard you even studied abroad. I knew I had important work here. Why... do you think war exists? We kill in the name of saving people. It's instinctual. We kill to survive. That's the war I saw. It has to stop before more sacrifices are made. It'll be difficult right now. Why? When we're out of bullets, they magically appear. We drank all the beer, work your magic. You damn commie! We know you're here to steal gasoline. What? I can't sleep because you reek of gas! Get the hell out before we report you. Can't you let this one slide? I won't. Thought you wouldn't get caught? I'm not doing this because I want to. Please let this slide. Walking through the forest... Clouds in the sky... Leaving behind the worries of the day Clouds are so pretty... What is it? Sir, Dong-gu is... stealing gasoline. What? Come together under the flag, courageously march... Teacher! What are you doing here? Look who's here! None other than Lt. Han. I'm an idiot. I shoulda done this sooner. It's nothing at all. A token of appreciation. It's a bribe. That's not very nice of you, it's from my heart. Do you know how strict military law is? Stealing military supplies and now bribes... That's enough for a summary trial. Are you threatening me? I'll overlook what happened so far. Then keep at it, that's good for you. Do you take me for a chump because I'm a cripple? Burying a lieutenant is not even work. The choir! I even helped you put together than damn choir! Then it's a fair trade, don't you think so? How's bourbon? Are they your things? You can trade lives. They're... indeed mine. They know it too, finders keepers. What? Being a teacher to them don't make you a big shot! Who fed them and kept them alive? If it weren't for me, they'd be in a ditch. Am I right? They're doing whatever it takes to survive. They search dead bodies and bang on live rounds. Have you no pity? Must you exploit them? What about me? No pity for me? I'm doing this for my survival too! The war is not over yet! Over 2 million have died, and even more will die! When it comes to survival, everyone's for themselves! Tell me I'm wrong. Don't ever mess with those kids. If you keep at it, you could get hurt. This is my only warning. Come with me. Hurry! Stop, stop. Ju-mi, stop. Dong-gu, Choon-sik, come on out. Face each other. Weren't you neighbors? - Yes. - Yes. - You were friends. - Yes. So how did you two become enemies? He's a commie! My family died because of those commies. And what about my dad?! The adults did all that! Did you do that? Is it your fault? Of course not. You did nothing wrong. Fight each other. Fight fairly and settle this for good. Fight. Fine. Dong-gu sing 'Danny Boy', Choon-sik 'Annie Laurie' at the same time. You lose if you mess up a note or lyrics. Ju-mi, could you play ra? Can you maintain that octave? - Yes. - Yes. One, two, three. Chorus is about singing different notes to create harmony. When different notes compliment each other, it becomes a beautiful song. Fight if you want to. But fight and create beautiful harmony. Fight to make harmony and music, that's a worthy fight, it's what I want from you. Then a wolf howled. Watermelon's here! - Let's continue later. - Have some watermelon. Take one each. There's plenty, so eat slowly. Slowly. Tomorrow's our first show, are you ready? Yes! Mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam Be it ever so humble there's no place like home A charm from the sky seems to hallow us there Which seek thro' the world is ne'er met with elsewhere Home! Home! Sweet, sweet home! There's no place like home There's no place like home Up from the valley we will make our way Leaving behind the worries of the day Being at one with all that we survey, singing aloud this joyous song Greeting the sunlight in the morning air is a happy feeling well beyond compare Singing aloud this joyous song Rice cakes! Eat slowly. So hungry. Lieutenant. Give them a compliment, they did so well. I knew... you'd do well since the beginning. Because when I look into your eyes, I only see honesty. He's serious again. You all did so well, and thank you! Stay put! It's a revolt! - Hide under the bed! - Don't go! Don't worry, I'll be right back. No, don't go! My dad also said he'd be back shortly. No... Okay. Salute! You can't even secure the base?! It'll be corrected, sir! Incompetent sons of bitches. Proceed! Ready position! Democratic People's Republic of Korea! Aim! Fire! Confirm kill! Lt. Han, are you okay? Did you have a nightmare? Yes... Do you need a hug? I feel better when my brother hug me after a nightmare. Thank you... Thank you... Why aren't you at the table! Come have breakfast! Hurry! You'll send me to an early grave! I'm not even married... That's your damn fault. You little! Come at once! She should meet a man, there's nothing but men here. Have some more. - Salute. - Yup. Teacher! That cripple man took Dong-gu and Soon-yi. What? What do you think you're doing?! Where's Soon-yi? I want to buy a brick factory. Everything's destroyed in the war. And everyone'll need bricks to rebuild. - It's all about bricks. - Hey kiddo! I'll buy everything, come over here. Remember Mr. Jo from Jisan district? What did I tell you, come before I get angry. Come here! He won't take a meeting, if you could pull a string... Set up a meeting for me. So pretty. Give me your lipstick. Why? Give it. If you could let me meet him... Raise your head. Look at me. What are you doing? Buzz off. - Smile. - Young master! She's just a kid. Sir, please stop. Soon-yi! Brother! Dong-gu, take her back. Go on. - What the hell?! - Dammit! Come here, come on! What's with you?! Goddammit! Who do you think you are?! You got a deathwish? You wanna die? Shall I sharpen you up? Why're you up my case? Don't touch my kids... You bastard! Help! Help me! Please! Can't swim... What a guy. Is it good? Give me a bite too. Mr. Hook. What did you do to him? Sweetie, head inside. What the hell are you doing? I'm a bit tired, let's chat later. Yo cripple! Did you just bark at me? Come here. Stand right there. Come here. Come on, get out! Are you nuts?! Is it nice being born with a silver spoon in your mouth? Please don't kill me! Sir, I'm sorry! I'm a scumbag too, but you're worse than pest! Mommy Have you wronged you? Have I done something bad to you? Drink. Thank you. The response to the choir was tremendous. We're getting a lot of show requests. So I selected one of them. Let's go to Cheolwon. We can't, that's a war zone. It's too dangerous for the kids, sir. 'We can't'? Look at this guy. Please reconsider, I'm begging you, sir. You prick! Where else is consolation more important?! 'Kids'? Even 15-year olds are fighting, bastard! It's an order! Proceed! I have an announcement. We received a request for a show. But the thing is, I can't take you there. What do you mean? It's a war zone, it's too dangerous. So I wish to disband this choir as of today. No, this choir can't disappear! You don't own the choir. How could you decide without asking us? Then do we have to leave here? No, I'll never! We know how you feel. But don't our opinions matter too? Do you know what's scarier than war and dying? Being abandoned, being all alone. We all love the choir! Feels like we found a family. Don't you feel that too? Is it just us? In any case, it's been decided. I can't send you there. Then let's vote. Not you too. It's fair to ask their opinion. - Let's vote! - We want to vote! Vote! Please! Have a vote. No matter the outcome, we'll follow. Close your eyes, and if you don't want to disband, raise your hand, okay? Close your eyes, keep them closed. If you don't want to disband, raise your hand. Be safe! Listen to the teachers! Stay alert! Be on guard! It's okay, children. Here we go, watch this. Thank you. Sleep some more. I see some hair growing under your nose. Stop it, it tickles. Brother, I want to pee. Let's go together. Why come so far? I was told not to pee anywhere like boys. - Says who? - Daddy. Choon-sik. You came to pee too? I'm not a girl, I came to poop. Then go further, it's gonna stink! You bimbo, don't laugh. I'll wait here, come down afterwards. What's taking him so long? Weird... Choon-sik! Choon-sik! Hey! I'm here! I got lost! Choon-sik! We'll find you, keep shouting! Dong-gu! I wanted to say I'm sorry! No way! I'm the one sorry! Choon-sik! Hey! Where are you?! Dong-gu! Where's Dong-gu, Soon-yi and Choon-sik? They went into the forest to pee. It's like a maze in there. Let's find them before it gets dark. Please gather our men, sergeant. Yes, sir. Dong-gu, Soon-yi! Dong-gu! Soon-yi! Choon-sik, where are you?! Choon-sik! I found him! Here! Here! You idiot, were you scared? Are you okay? Teacher. - You good? - Yes. - Dong-gu and Soon-yi? - I don't know. Bro, I'm scared. I'm right here, don't be scared. Private, bring them over. Dong-gu! Enemy sighted! Stay there! Dong-gu! Bro! Blood pressure? 60 over 80. Heartbeat? It's dropping. Prep respirator and secure enough blood for transfusion. Right away. This is going to hurt. He's getting treated, he'll get better. Don't cry. Is blood secured? No yet, I called it in but it'll take time. How much longer? They're not sure... Doctor. We're the same blood type, you can transfuse mine. No, you lost a lot of blood too. It's okay. I'm begging you. I'm sorry, Dong-gu. Dong-gu... Teacher... Dong-gu! Soon-yi... She's fine, she's with Ju-mi. That's good... Teacher... Thank you... I always wanted to say it, but I never got to... Teacher... I think I'm being punished for all the bad things I did... Dong-gu. You did nothing wrong, it's not your fault. I'm the one who failed you, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Dong-gu. Could I see Soon-yi... Okay. Soon-yi! Ju-mi! Soon-yi... Brother! I'm fine. No crying. No crying. Soon-yi. You know how much I like you. Of course, I like you too. I suddenly want to hear you sing. I'll regain strength if you do. Teacher said so too. Dad didn't die because of you. I want you to sing again, and smile even more, and get along with choir friends. Brother... Dong-gu... Crake, crake, crake bird, they sing in the field Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo bird, they sing in the forest When my brother goes to Seoul on a horse, he promised to buy me silk shoes Goose, goose... - Dad! - Daddy! Wild goose flies in from the north Chirp, chirp, chirp of cricket The day it chirped Still no news from my brother who left for Seoul Only the sound of leaves, as they fall to the ground July, 1953 Teacher. Sounds great. Could you continue? Liberation! The war's over! We're liberated! It's all over! I'm Seonlin Orphanage Choir's conductor Han San-ryul. When the war broke out, and we lost so much. Laughter of children that echoed on the field, chimney smoke during sunset, the scent of cooking rice... And warm voices calling each other's names. One child said once, what we long for becomes stars in the sky. I was happy to hear that. While we're alive, those stars will always be there, and whenever we look up, we could hear their voices. Brother, are you watching? I'm gonna sing. Listen carefully. My home is a blooming mountain village Peach flower, apricot flower, baby azalea Glaring colors from flower palace I miss the time I played there Flower village, bird village weeping wallows begin dancing I miss the time I played there The real choir that this film was based on toured all over the country during war. Immediately after the truce, it is the first choir to sing for US Senate. After Korean War that resulted in over 2 million casualties, Korea remains the only divided nation on earth. Wishing for a world without war...
