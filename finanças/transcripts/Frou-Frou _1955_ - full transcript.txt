Fortunately, I arrive on time. At home immediately! And did you leave like that, without even saying goodbye? But haven't you found the letter? Yes, yes, we'll talk about it later! Ah no mom! It is useless I am leaving. In Africa, with a stranger? Ah no, you went crazy. I love her mom. But you love Paola too soon! 4 months ago you didn't even know him! And when you wanted to go to Brazil with my father, how long have you known him? Not even two months. This is not your concern. And then, a serious young man, came to me to ask to marry you. To be told no! Thanks! Now stop Paola, I'm your mother! Obey! You talk to me as if I refuse a toy. I'm not 8 anymore mom! And it's about my happiness. And who better than your mother can take care of it? You have always lacked courage before happiness! Aren't you ashamed to talk to me like this? But I'm not asking you to let me live, it's my right. Paola, what do you know about life? Enough not to want to spoil it like you spoiled yours. Go to table 14, the prince wants orchids. An authentic prince? Other than authentic! He is a relative of the Tsar. Say a little, what should I call it? Call him prince. Here are the orchids, Prince. How do you know I'm a prince? Well, with that beard... I've never seen you here, are you new? No, I was on leave because my dog ​​was sick, and the doctor had told me to change the air. So he took him to the countryside. - Is he healed? - No. - Is dead. - Oh, poor beast! I loved him, even my aunt. Do you have an aunt? I had it is dead. She too? Oh yeah! What do you want, when the series begins... - Funny the girl. - What's your name? Antoinette. But everyone calls me Frou Frou. Why Frou Frou? Well I don't know, maybe because I like ladies' petticoats so much, those that make frrrrr... - Ah, she's pretty. - Delicious truly delicious. Adorable, just adorable. I have the impression that we are too many. If you like it a lot, get your address from the hotel metro. Especially since he must be fed up with always giving yours! You don't have to be smart to sell flowers. Oh for what you sell, there is no need to have invented the dust! But how do you allow it? You don't have to take it seriously. Good excuse! I've had enough of being insulted by this smorfiosa. - Send her away or I'm leaving! - You would do well. At this hour the young ladies like you are all in bed! Good! It's a cool brazen you know? Calm down... go. Thanks. You know I'm not bad, but you don't have to tease me... eh! It is really delicious. Ah, and fun too. - Funny that stupid girl? - I couldn't take it anymore, another minute and I was bursting! With that air of false naive. I have never seen anything more vulgar. She is not a duchess, but how cute she is... It does not lack a certain charm eh... I'd almost say it's spicy! Funny, pretty, spicy... Well enjoy it, I'm leaving! - Me too. - Me too, yes and immediately! No, on Christmas evening. I don't care, you shouldn't have let us insult you! A Cento Luigi dress! Oh no, really too good! What are you laughing at? She must be furious, it's the first time she gets naked for free! Come on, go sell flowers. Mrs. Berte. That... If you try it? But no, we would miss more! It's Christmas Eve, on... It's useless you know, don't move me! Go Go. - But, what are you doing? - I want to try it, Mrs Berte. Yeah, did you go crazy? Do you want to put me on the door? Just a moment, just a moment. It's early then. Oh thank you Mrs Berte ... But yes, yes of course. It is the first time that I wear such a beautiful dress! Do you think it will fit me? If I had one too... It's not my excellence fault. Oh yes, you are right, right, what do you want... your dress was so beautiful... My? Why mine? Oh but, why did you pay for it, didn't you? Not ready yet? Ah no! This is too much! Who gave you permission? You, right? Yes my dear. Of a little beauty, are you serious or are you kidding me? I would never allow myself to joke with you my dear. Oh yes? Well, then it's over! It closes, much better this way! It has been a long time since the noble beard of your height, it's on my stomach! I must think that our idyll has ended. Exact! Now you just have to liquidate my little account. And... on Christmas evening it will cost you dearly! A jewel? No no, a cottage. Yup? Miss Frou Frou? It's me. You are welcome. Thanks. Do I have to come with you? Yes Miss. But how? So right away? Yes, the gentlemen have told me to take you to them immediately. All right. ...relationship status. Read and approved, Paris 11 January 1913. - All right. - Very well! Perfect! So are you happy? Of what? It is the fourth time that we explain it to you. Yes I understand correctly, however ... I don't believe it is too beautiful. So, an apartment. Two servants... clothes, jewelry... Two carriages. With horses? - Yes - And a coachman in livery. Full of silver buttons everywhere? And shiny boots. - Oh la la, all for me? - Yup. But and I... what should I give you in return? Nothing. Nothing? Nothing nothing. Nothing! Absolutely nothing! Yup... This means it all! I get it. Goodbye and thank you gentlemen. - Frou Frou where are you going? - Come back now! - No no! Come on! Let's go sit! Come on come on, first sit down sit down. Don't you trust? Put yourself in my place... But we are four. For this. We are looking for your good. We want you to become an elegant woman. A famous woman. We want to launch you. That's why we made a pact. A pact between a Russian prince, a colonel, a colonel, an Italian count, an Italian count, and a businessman, you can rest easy. Listen! Article two: The four signatories take care of the education of the aforementioned, Eh, the above is you. I? Oh damn. ... The above, and they undertake never to show them their sentimental intentions. Did you understand? Yes, I will become a lady. Goodmorning Prince. Good morning. You are wrong, today is my day. Not at all, it's my day. Are you sure? Do some calculation. Allow? Thanks. Well! Now with two volumes. That? I'm not a walking library, I mean, you know? You must learn to walk elegantly! Let's go upstairs! It's not easy. Very easy! Napoleon always said... Shit! What are you doing here, colonel? Thanks. I take care of Frou Frou's education, it's my day. You have a somewhat vague idea of ​​the Sigismondo calendar and you, it's Friday today, my dear! Are you sure? Word of a prince. In this case, I just have to present my apologies, for this mistake, involuntary! And take my leave. Frou Frou. Well. I asked you a hundred times not to do what the colonel says. You don't want me to listen to the colonel, the colonel doesn't want me to listen to you, Sabatier doesn't... Oh, that one leave it alone! Should you move like this for him? Shout, damn it! Oh la la, a little bit. Good evening sir, thank you! No! Come on, go change. I'll take you where... ... where French courtesy was born... ... in Versailles. The king lived in that palace. Who knows how much he had to pay rent! Kings never pay, raking! So who pays? The people. The people? Now I understand why there was a revolution! But how come Berte, he continues to say, who is the people who pay? So what's the revolution for? To put new heads in place of falling ones. Yes, Napoleon in place of Louis XVI. Do you know this? Yes, it is the colonel who explained it to me. Whenever things go wrong, he is called a military man. In those times it was Napoleon. He put the crown on his head and said to the Pope: Dear friend, I'm so sorry, from today I'm in charge! Did he say that? No! Yup! Don't you know? That was a man, who went for the segments! He changed his wife like that, op! In four and four! Luckily there was Robespierre. Robespierre? Yes, Robespierre was a man who never laughed. And he said to Napoleon: Don't bore me. You exaggerate my little one! Then Napoleon got angry, and cut off his head. And then he married an Austrian, a certain Maria... Maria... Maria... Maria Antoinette. Maria Antoinette? No, no, no, no! Maria Luisa, Maria Luisa. This made him a son. Since Napoleon had a passion for eagles, the eagle called him. Then the Germans made war! No!? In short, you don't know anything! And then he, had not had time to prepare... Don't tell me you want to go to Frou Frou! That's exactly what I'm doing. But how... isn't it Sunday today? No, Saturday. Take. No thanks, they would age me. Good morning dear, how are you? Please take a seat. Can I offer you a cup of tea? Oh, a drop of port, I'm calling the waitress. Are you done making the parrot? The parrot? Yup! The parrot of those three imbeciles who are destroying all that is good in you! But how, you don't like me like this? Ah no! For nothing! You have lost everything, everything! Freshness, simplicity, sincerity, everything! But how do you want it to be? You never tell me anything... Why? But everything is false in you now. You were perfect when you were yourself. The small flower shop of the "Baene Helene". Really? Yup. I liked you right away. Oh that's great. Nobody had ever told me, such a thing. Because nobody loved you. And you? I? Yup. It's Sunday today Gustavo isn't it? I'm not wrong huh? No sir. Eh, I knew it! Good morning Mrs. Bruneè. Nice day huh? It is a beautiful Sunday. Sunday. Brava! Oh, thank you sir. Goodmorning Sir. Hello Berte. How nice it is Sunday huh! Oh sir, there are no more Sundays for me. No, don't say that like Berte. Life is Beautiful! Today is wonderful for me! Miss Frou Frou, okay? Very well sir. Please announce me. - Right away sir. - Thanks. But how? Isn't it Sunday today? Yup. First Sunday of the month, meeting day. It is in the statute. And I thought that... Ohh, I was still wrong! Take a seat dear friend. You should consult a Sigismondo doctor, your gaps are becoming more frequent! Yup! More frequent! Listen to me Conte, it's very important. It's about the future of Frou Frou. I do not agree. It doesn't matter, you are the minority. - Unfortunately. - Then shut up. Frou Frou must be launched. Finish ruining it! Please, you don't have the floor! Let's make Frou Frou... The woman of the day! Ah yes, but how? It is not an easy thing! How? That is the question. I wonder why those gentlemen care so much about you. Well, yet it's simple. They have nothing to do and are bored. I enjoy them. It costs him dear, but they are so rich who can't spend their money. I help them a little. Eh, you don't know anything about life dear Berte. I will have to take care of your future. Bonjour. How did it end? What? The song. Why, do you like it? Ah, not only do we like it... But it discovers new horizons... right? Yup! New horizons! Come on, sing it back a little. Oh no, I can't sing! Come on sing great! Well what do you have, why do you make that face? I do not approve of it at all, the plans of these gentlemen. L projects? You will know them soon. I'd like to know why we came right here tonight. But, for Frou Frou. Is she one of your lovers? I don't even know her. - You don't wanna sing? - And why? What are these whims? He's afraid. - Fear? - You are scared? - Yes - Better, come away! Oh, no, no, no! You want to ruin me, if he doesn't sing, they will smash everything. And if he sings they make your skin, don't you know? And it will sing instead, and it will be a triumph! Up on Frou Frou. I forbid you to martyr this little girl! Do you frankly say I'm a monster? I prefer not to say what I think! I will send you my godparents! I look forward to seeing them! No, no, no, come on, this isn't serious! What you do is serious! Come Frou Frou! And who pays? All of me! Frou Frou, do what I tell you! Pardon... It is not for you to make a decision, we are four. I have the impression that you will not have the pleasure of seeing it, nor to listen to this Frou Frou. Sin. For you? No, for her. You can't wait any longer, the audience starts to get impatient! I'm going to say he doesn't sing. One moment. So Frou Frou, have you decided? Can't you sing? No he doesn't sing! Please don't talk to you. Frou Frou. Reply! I will sing! Brava! Courage I will access a candle for you! I'm going to warn the orchestra. Bravo bravo, yes. Oh, no I can't sing! No no I can't! Hold. Ah no, it's worth nothing. I knew you about more difficult tastes! I will be changed thanks to you. He did it! Well, sure success! Brava! I'm leaving! No! And why? Can you ask me? Frou Frou will make his career. Imagine, all this enthusiasm is paid, don't you see it? Poor baby, you're pretty bad! Small... That knows as long as you and I put it together. Oh, Berte, listen, feel it happened. A new star triumphantly rises in the sky of Paris! It's me. Oh, how happy I am, What's this? I don't know, they brought it. That will certainly not be ruined for you. To forgive me. Forgive what? What did he do to you? So far nothing. Like nothing? I assure you nothing. And would you like him to do something? I do not know. Yes or no? Maybe. Colonel. Sabatier. Thanks. I can't wait to see it. How happy she will be. Gentlemen... Tonight, despite article two... I give her a kiss. Ah pardon, it's absolutely irregular! Contrary to the statute. I don't care about this. I've been waiting for a year, I seem to have the right... - Ah, shame it's a girl! - A little girl? - Yes. - For me, it's a woman! And what a woman! In love? As if you were the only one. We are all in love. Yes but I confess it! As soon as our stupid agreements end, I warn you... I'll take Frou Frou. Ah no, you can't, it belongs to us 4, we created it. I'll leave that Frou Frou. Ah, you regret the other, the florist, the rough diamond. Perfectly! Stay to see... If you prefer it as it was, or as it is now. And if he wants to follow you. So is it decided? You do not come? No. Why? Why I changed my mind. Come on Frou Frou, you can't do this. It is in your honor that we organized this lunch. We prepared you, even a nice surprise! Well, I'll make you another one, I'm not coming! I know perfectly well all that I owe to you four. No, no, let's not talk about this. Yes, I know what I owe you, I'm not ungrateful. If you need money, I will sell the furniture, the jewelry. If you get sick I will heal you. If you die... Will you buy a black veil? Thanks. - But you refuse to have dinner with us. - Yup! Frou Frou. Are you in love. I? But don't say nonsense! You are in love with Frou Frou. And when a girl your age prefers to be alone... and get bored with friends... Leave me alone. And when he gets nervous for no reason... Ugh, uffa uffa! No, I'm not in love, but I don't know what I would give to really be, I swear to you! Power. Please, I beg you, go away... Go away, I want to be alone! But Sigismondo, what the heck does it do? Here is Frou Frou. Long live Frou Frou! What about Frou Frou? What happened? Are you sick? No. I will tell you... Decline the invitation. How does it not come, why? Eh, because he doesn't feel like it. The truth... is that she is in love. It was fatal, did you want to make it an artist? In love with whom? Of love. That is, nobody's. That is, of the first come. I have the impression that Frou Frou is elegantly making fun of us. He already makes fun of us. He enjoys making fun of us, but now he's done! Gustave. Lord? Four straws. Yes, sir. Straws? And why? To draw lots who will save us from ridicule. We certainly didn't roast the chestnuts, because someone else would eat them. What do you want to do? Precede the events, if we are still on time. How? In every way. Ah, I understand, I will abstain. Better, a less rival. Here sir. Thanks. Why do you stop? I don't want to tire the horses. But if we did just a few meters! In fact, it is already too much, they are new. I have to save them. Ah, don't you say now that we continue on foot? Why not, the weather is great, walking will do us good! Well maybe you, not me. If your horses are new, my shoes too and I don't want to spoil them. I will carry you in my arms! To crease my nice dress. I'll buy you another. Buy, buy. You cannot say anything else you and your friends. What do you mean? I'm not as stupid as you think. Ah no, anything but stupid, you know how to make the saint pure. Santa I don't know, but... Pure I could swear it. Are you pure? No... Yup. Seriously? Yes, seriously, really seriously. I am a serious girl, even too serious. Well, it's amazing! Yes, I knew you were. And what will I say to others now? Why the others? Up... Come down, don't be afraid, you don't risk anything now. Then? Well then, I'm very embarrassed. You understand me, it was the case that decided that... I was supposed to be... Ah, I understand, you cast me! Yup. And I confess, I also cheated a bit. For this beautiful result. You understand me, I don't wish that... ... who knew... ...you understand? No. I wish you would say, that you and I... We did what we didn't do. That's right! And would you be gentlemen? You all make me sick! Take, here are your new shoes, one! And two! Frou Frou! - Here's the muff, here's the hat, - Listen to me, no! People are coming! Ah well, very well, now I also take off my dress! No Frou Frou, you're crazy! Don't touch me, especially you! Help! Help! Sir, stop! Stop! Stop sir. But you are Frou Frou. Yes please sir... We don't need you. Oh, we won again! Look here, see what good luck? Henri, at this hour? I won't be serious, but I'm honest, I warned you. Remember? I only remember that you were too close to me. And do you regret it? If I said yes? I wouldn't believe you. And you would be right my love. Have you lost yet? All! Plus a penny! You are always proud of what you do. Always! I have the impression that you only love yourself! There is some truth in what you say. Beast! It doesn't matter, I like you like this! Come out, leave me alone, play well... ... I don't care as long as you come back. How funny you are! Who is it? A Hungarian. You know how I am... he kissed me a lot to do something. Nothing serious. I understand, it was just to make me laugh. You won't start being jealous! I'm sorry. Do you know what I was thinking about? At our first meeting. When I kidnapped you in the car. Car of your Italian countess. If you want... Especially the face you made, waking up in my apartment. Offered by the American billionaire. But why do you put labels everywhere? Ready? One moment. Your Hungarian wants to speak to you. Hello, yes it is me. Good morning Zita. Oh yes, certainly. How? Who answered the phone? It was the... Your maid. Yes, my maid. But no, you're wrong, you go thinking. Montecarlo? Yes sure we go! All right, in an hour at the station. I'm sorry I'm in a hurry. That stupid woman had to call! Frou Frou, I'm sorry. Last night, you already knew you had to leave. Well yes. But if I told you, tonight... I understand. Frou Frou you are... wonderful, I... Why do you love me? If I knew... I would get operated. Frou Frou. You know? Yes, everything. It was terrible! You can't imagine how much... I suffered. It was all for me... it was... Your youth, that's all. Oh come on. Come on, come on, don't cry about Frou Frou. These are things that unfortunately happen. Our heart is like our liver, everything we like, it hurts. Let's go away! Give me a smile! Oh, thank goodness! And tell me... ... would you like to know Russia? The Russia? Yes, I have to go there. Accompany me, as a good friend Frou Frou, word of a prince. You will soon forget it. And when we return to Paris... you will laugh at this adventure. You didn't love him, but he was rich. For you, only money matters. No. But I know how much it is necessary. Stuff from other times mom. Ever. Without money you will not be happy. Why? Why is Henri poor? Who cares? He is young, intelligent, brave! I have faith in him, he will become someone. I know what it will do for me and my children. No mom, I'll be happy, I'm sure of it. Money never made happiness. To what use has the immense fortune of your prince, have you been happy with him? Are you crying, what do you have? It is joy. I no longer thought of seeing my country again. Ah understood. Nine years are long, war, post war... The revolution. What revolution? I come back from Russia. Ah yes, that was there too. It's a vice! It's over, don't worry. Are we in Paris? Not even in Lyon, look it's still day. But how do you sleep? I just don't understand you! I am dead tired. Me too, but only with the idea of ​​seeing Paris again... I am afraid of dreaming. Did you telegraph your friend the Grand Duke to pick us up? Yup! It's the third time you've asked me, don't worry! We will certainly find him at the station with his car and his chauffeur. Are you sure he will give you back the money you gave him? Yes, yes, yes, don't... let me sleep! Not at the train, not at the exit... your Grand Duke cheated you huh? He will come, he will always be late! The Grand Duke's chauffeur? He is my colonel! It's Nicolai Petrovic, my colonel. Miss Frou Frou. I'm a little worried... The Grand Duke no longer lives in the Art Nouve. But what do you care, ask him for the new address, maybe he knows it. I know miss. In a club. How do you live in a cabaret? No directs it. Very chic, great, very successful in Paris. Anna Alexandrovna Good evening Anna Alexandrovna. Good evening Alexej Petrovic. Have you called for caviar? Yes, we called. How many tables reserved tonight? Ten tables. Well, continue your work. Who allowed you to touch the balalaika? Let it be the last time. Yes, Grand Duchess. And my name is not Grand Duchess! Well lady. Oh, pardon! No, no, no, come in, come in Anna Alexandrovna. You no longer recognize Vladimir Petrovic Bilinsky. But yes it is true! It has changed a little since the time of my receptions in St. Petersburg. Everything has changed, even St. Petersburg. Everything except you Anna Alexandrovna. You are always beautiful! Thanks I know. It is she who directs the staff here, and with what energy! I was already running the Tsarina's private home. The system is the same, scold the whole world. Only I had to change the names. Neither. Allow me Anna Alexandrovna, to introduce you to a friend. Miss Frou Frou. Her imperial highness, the Grand Duchess, Anna Alexandrovna. I am happy to meet you, lady. Me too. I hope to see you soon Vladimir Petrovic I live in Coral... fifth floor. I have no lift, but the sky is close. Heaven must be earned. Ah, sure. Tomorrow I will come to see you Anna Alexandrovna. I wait for you. The from 5 to 7, as in St. Petersburg. Good evening. Ah, what a line, what nobility. That's all the Bolsheviks allowed to bring. Unfortunately it is not marketable. - Vodka? - Thanks. Now Vladimir, let's talk a little, about the money you gave me to make it bear fruit. There is no more! Is dead! He is dead, but how? The government. But you joke Especially since we ruined ourselves together! - But it was a huge sum! - Drink! Oh, I believe it well! 500,000 pounds! Well, it was French francs, which I had given you. Yes, yes, but I have changed to pounds. Excellent operation! I reap... 100,000 pounds! And with all this... I bought German brands. Drink! Council of compatriot. Drink! A month later, I sold everything by weight. - By weight? - Yes, 3 francs per kilo. Oh my god, but you're ruined! Russian style, to the bone! Drink! But there is always the Bosphorus! But here in Paris there is the Seine! No, Bosphorus is a cabaret, our cabaret. You will work with us. At the Bosphorus, even the cook is an officer of the tsar's guard. Can you dance Cossack? Ah... yes, no! No? Of course? Don't you remember the Villa Rosè in St. Petersburg? Eh... sure. And miss, what can she do? Ah, he used to sing. Ah well, then sing! Allow me to help you, I can't stand that you... No, no, let me do it, you are very kind, but count in person. 12-14-16-18-19, therefore 21 from outside. Yes, Anna Alexandrovna. Good evening Anna Alexandrovna. Good evening Alexevicic. Two... for fifteen. Pardon, Anna Alexandrovna. One moment Andrei lvanovic... Is this how they use woodcocks? Don't you know that Flambè must be made in front of the customer? It is not my fault Anna Alexandrovna. It is chef Gregory Andreic, who prepared the dish. Tell him you learn, otherwise I will be forced to replace him! There is Count Paola di Nasky who will be enchanted to take the place. Yes, but Gregory is Duke Anna Alexandrovna. Tell him the same! I will not miss Anna Alexandrovna. Pardon. How sad you are all of a sudden. What are you thinking about? To you. To me? Yup. Remember the winter... 1908? December 5, 1908? Yup. We had been all day... riding alone in the forest. We are back, the sun was setting... Your blonde hair was like a flame. Yes, I remember. There was a big lunch that evening with us. I sat in front of you... Yup. Suddenly the light goes out. And the waiters bring a large silver platter with flaming woodcocks. Your face was... All gilded by that fire. I looked at you... Full of admiration and love. Since... I can't see woodcocks. Without thinking about you, Anna Alexandrovna. Couldn't you find another animal to think about me? Frou Frou. Again? But because you insist, you know very well that it is not! Put yourself in my place, 20 francs every night. You take the 20 francs, and throw the ticket away. Have you read the latest news? - No. - No. In Russia there is famine everywhere. The Bolsheviks still have little. To our holy Russia. To our tsar. Next year we will be in Saint Petersburg. Ah, of course Anna! You think you bring your... - What's the name over there? - Frou Frou. Is it true that she was a florist when you met her? Yes, he was 16 years old. It looked so good among the flowers... Yes, like me in woodcocks, right? Forgive me again Anna Alexandrovna, forgive me. What is this story of woodcocks? A secret. Attention Anna Alexandrovna, when you start with a secret, it always ends with an alcove. Uh, no danger, the place is taken. Is the seat taken? Yes. From the princess. Which princess? Your Frou Frou, everyone calls her princess here. It is not possible. And how many laugh! All of this is very bad Vladimir Petrovic. You should decide to marry her, go to the people. It is not a bad idea. Marry Frou Frou? I? Prince Vladimir Petrovic Bilinsky? But do you speak seriously? How do you sleep? Pardon. Do you sleep or don't you sleep? Ah yes I sleep. Then you sleep with her. How long? Oh my God... Enough is too much. - As? - Shut up! - Do you love her? - Oh, listen... If you don't love her, then pass your hand, break understand? I got it? I got it. Here is the shirt of his height. If you insist on changing one a day, soon you will no longer have any. Frou Frou, you forget too often, that I am a prince. Prince in bill. Maybe. In any case, I face fate with a lot of nobility. In my opinion, when facing someone, you are standing not in bed. You'd better go looking for work. For 700 years no one has ever worked in my family. Well you will be the first. I? That as a child I was kept on the tsar's lap? Why did the czar keep you on your knees, do I have to spend my life washing and mending your laundry? A no dear! But if you don't want to work, at least try to find your old friends. They all died during the war. Sabatier no, he will help you. I'm not a warehouse worker, I hate making debts. Except with the butcher, the baker and the charcuterie. Those are musks, I honor them by allowing me to feed. They don't seem satisfied. What cracks then! Meanwhile, it is I who die. I can't take this life anymore! I can not stand it anymore! I can not stand it anymore! Oh how I understand them, the Bolsheviks should have killed everyone, everyone! What is wrong with you? It takes me that I'm sick of your principles, your dukes! I'm here too! Do you know that your Grand Duchess doesn't even greet me? Do you know this? What is that? Phone. Here it is, it starts early this morning huh? It's useless, you can't see it on the phone! Where are you going? I ask you where you go with your tsarina? No! So as they say in holy Russia, don't bother me! Take a seat on the first floor. Mister Sabatier. She's not in Paris miss. - Not in Paris? - No miss. - When he returns? - I don't know miss. Could I speak to your secretary? Who should I announce? Frou Frou. How? Frou Frou. Hello, there is a certain Miss Frou Frou who would like to talk to you. Not you, he wanted to see M. Sabatier. I don't know, yes, it's fine. Write a letter to the company explaining the reason, they will certainly answer you. Thanks. Good evening. Good evening! Say a little, is it a sign of nobility for you not to answer the greeting? When it comes to small staff, yes! Well, you're all servants here! - Dei Servi? - Yup! Your friends dukes, princes, counts and colonels, they bend down to the ground to take tips. Yes, but I'm the mistress! - Here, and only here. - This means? It means, leave Vladimir and me alone, do you understand? In Russia I would have made you whip, for my Cossacks! Well, in France to give you 2 slaps, I don't need the republican guard! What's going on here? He insulted me, I don't want to see her anymore! But why, do you persist in not greeting her? I do not greet that Tsar, Vladimir Petrovic... And customers starting with the third bottle! Yes but... It's not there but that holds, I said, I don't want to see it here anymore! And this should be enough! Yes, yes. There is no yes or yes. Go tell him! Unless you want me to put it on the door! - I'll try to make them understand... - I recommend it! Frou Frou, I'm sorry... you should never have... Let me talk to your beloved Grand Duchess? Not like you did anyway. You start badly, my dear! I heard very well, what your dear Anna said. He was shouting so loud, that I haven't lost a word! He doesn't want to see me anymore, and you have to put me at the door. It is something that I have been waiting for for a long time. It just amazes me that it didn't happen before. But what are you thinking. You want to get rid of me. I never said that! No, but your eyes say it! Your resigned smiles say so. Yes, you have had enough of me... You just don't know how to send me away. At least have the courage to confess it. You don't know what you're saying! I know Vlad very well, and you know better than I do. Oh, listen to Frou Frou... No, don't talk, in certain situations, you don't know what to say, yet this is simple... You love her, and above all she is Grand Duchess. Oh sure, I lived 12 years with you and I could consider myself your wife, this scares you now that you love another one. But don't worry... I understood very well as soon as I entered here. That I had lost you forever. You found your world... and your world, he didn't want to know about me... I tried to fight, but... bitterness, disgust, fatigue tonight. Vlad is better off. Sin... Of course we didn't love each other, but they had suffered so much together, that this replaced the rest. Frou Frou, we can't leave each other like this. Yes, if I have to leave, it's better immediately. And where do you go? What do you want to do? Don't worry about it. Goodbye Vlad. That's all? Good luck. Frou Frou. I know it's not, but tell her yourself. I'd rather lose 20 francs than repeat the same thing over and over again! Where is it? Out in the car, I'll take you there. No, I find it from me. Good evening. Thanks. Thanks for coming, you have finally made up your mind. Where do we go? At my house, we'll be better. If you knew what it is for me to have you close... How much I wanted this moment. I no longer hoped to see you. No, no! What do you have? Stop! Stop! And why did you come? I don't know, sorry. I will never forget that night! It was difficult to recover. Disgust, fear, hunger. We must have suffered to know what it is. You reproach me that I think too much about money. But when there is none, you always think about it the more you suffer, the more you think about it. Yes, by dint of thinking about it, you killed my father. What do you say! The truth mom. Oh, let's go down it's more fun! You're crazy Manon, it's dangerous for a woman! So come with me Gabrieux. Be reasonable Manon, they are not people of our class. They are only Parisians, and after 5 years of absence from here, I would like to embrace them all! We too are Parisians. Well, I will start with you and end with the others. Come on let's go! Come! Manon, stay here, Manon! Do you horror? They say I look like the man who laughs. But don't worry... I just want to kiss you. Let me out, let me out. For once the beauty came to meet me... no! Go away! - Would you kiss me for 1 million? - No! - For 2-3 for 10 million? - No! No! No! For nothing. For pity's sake? No I beg you, leave me! Leave me! Someone wrote... You call me your life, call me your soul... because the soul is immortal, and life lasts only one day. Nice huh? It is an invitation to love. It's not true? Oh no, I beg you, let me go. Why are you so mean to me? Since I saw you, I had only eyes for you. Do you want me to kill you for you? But not... But not! If the gentleman takes responsibility, I have nothing to say. But you think it would happen if the gentleman's uncle came back suddenly. Take away all that is fragile. Come on, soon soon soon! Hold on, don't waste time. Oh, this book too. But Mr. Josef, a book is not fragile! Have you ever been drunk? Come on do what I tell you. Begone! Here they are! Ah, the flowers! Let's go with them, I need them... It's not a glass I'm looking for... Do you want a bed? Yes, I want a bed! Ahhh, good idea! I hadn't thought of it, come on let's go find it. It's nothing. Here we go. Come on let's go find the bed. - But there is no bed! - No there is no bed. Come on, let's try there. - Yes - There is no bed here, so let's try here. - There is the bed! - There is the bed! - There is a bed! - There is a bed! Oh, no, no no! Wait up. Why? Why am I ashamed to undress... Do you have modesty? Yup! Oh, it's nice you know, it's moving, here you have to take off your hat. Goodmorning Sir. Is the gentleman tired of the trip? No Josef, I made an ideal crossing, a real rest. Oh, great. - Is there mail? - On the desk sir. Calls? Yes, sir. Several calls from London and Boston, I passed them on to Mr. Giraux in the factory. Other? Yes and no, tonight Mr, Paul, the grandson of the lord, he came with his friends... That one... nothing broken? A few glasses here and there sir. The minimum. I had removed everything that was fragile out of prudence. Bravo Josef. Call the office, and say I'll be there in an hour. Well sir. Frou Frou. Frou Frou. Hey, Frou Frou. But how, you don't recognize me? I know, many years have passed, however... Sabatier. Oh yeah! But, what are you doing here? Don't you think it would be up to me to ask you? Why? Oh my god, but... but then I'm in your house! Oh yeah... I could have expected anything except to find you in my bed this morning. I will try to explain... You can call me, it will be easier. So... It started last night at the artists' ball... to go there I had come on purpose to Paris from Torquay. And what were you doing in Torquay? I sing in provincial theaters. I defend myself. You have to live. Well, you defended yourself pretty bad tonight! Of course appearances are against me. But nothing happened. Nothing! I am broke, but... as for the rest I choose. My only luxury. You haven't changed Frou Frou, you're always the same. How many times have I thought of you. Do you remember when I told you I loved you? In the woods, when you tried to... I was ridiculous. Rather. I stood there like an idiot watching you go away with another. I didn't love you, then... I was young. If I had known... Ah, the life of a single woman is not happy. You have suffered a lot. Yup. Sometimes, I felt so alone... So desperate that... Now I'm Frou Frou, rest. You will no longer have to fight. But what does it do? Are you waiting for someone? Vladimir, don't you mind? No, as long as he comes without the Grand Duchess. Rest assured, he no longer goes out with her. - Toh, why? - He married her. Vladimir. Hi. - Good evening Frou Frou. - Good evening Vlad. Let's get out of here. How are you? Much better since I found Sabatier. Yes me too. I know, I'm happy, he's a true friend. I take care of your racehorses. Did he make you work? Oh you know, I don't run, I run horses! By the way, how's the Grand Duchess doing? Here, I like the apropos... she's fine thanks... Oh, sorry... Excuse me again madam. There are some rude people. Yup. Hello, who is speaking? It's for you lady. - Ah yes, who is it? - Mr. Victor Hugo. Ah yes I understand... Thanks. Ready? Yes, I understand who you are, but how did you get my number? I understand, the phone book... Sabatier. See me? You are very rich... and then? Better for you sir. But no, I repeat that it is useless to insist... I will not come. I don't care about your address sir. I won't come to you anyway. But not. I knew you would come. It's wonderful! Thanks. Go up. Go up! Sit. Don't worry, it's solid, it's the only one! Why did you lie to me? Why... because lying is the essence of life. Without lies, there is no joy or love. And I love you lady, and you will be mine. Ah no, here we are no longer at the ball, stop with the nonsense or go away immediately. They tolerate madmen, but not every day. Who are you? Artus for everyone... Paolo for friends, for you what you want... and you lady, what's your name? Juliet, Rosalinda, Melisetta... Frou Frou. Frou Frou? The name of a dog... for me you are Manon. - Do you want me to leave? - Ah no, stay. A thousand times I have dreamed of this meeting. And each time in a different way. I dreamed... Thing? To kiss you. Ah no, forgive me Manon, forgive me! I will not do it again Swear? I swear. Well. - Are they your paintings? - Yup. And you sell? My furniture. What's this? It's me. Poor boy. Ah, finally a kind word! Ah, no! Let's not start again eh? I can watch? Please. What does it represent? Ah, I don't know yet, but I'll find it soon. And this? So! The impression of a rainy day. And where's the rain? It was yesterday... today everything is sunny. Do you sell it? The soul is not sold to angels, it is given. Is this painting beautiful? No lady. At least not for me, maybe the other paintings but... Then according to you, this young man has no future. Why not? Talent is not essential for success. A beautiful exhibition, good advertising and here is a painter launched. Sometimes 3 well-orchestrated notes can give the impression of genius. - Do you believe? - Oh yes. Thank you thank you. See Jean, the lord says that Artus has genius, and that you have to take care of him, isn't it? - With a good publicity launch... - We will. Do you deal with young artists? - You have to - Listen? I thank you very much for coming. Nothing is my job. You will always be welcome here. - Hope to see you. - Thanks. Unfortunately I go out very little. - Good evening. - Good evening. He goes away. Here she is! He found the picture magnificent! Yes, Artus is the painter of tomorrow. A certain Mr. Artus asks about the lady. Let it pass. He is the young artist discovered by Frou Frou. Good evening, Sabatier. Prince Bilinsky. You will certainly want to speak to the landlady, please. Take a seat waiting for you. Thanks. I present to you Paolo Artus. They welcomed him as if he already had his paintings in the Louvre. I don't know if he has talent... but he's a handsome young man! Yup. How old is your painter? I do not know. Why? Aren't you just jealous by chance? You are never jealous by accident. It is not him, but his painting that interests me, nothing else. I love you. Me too. Not as much as I do. You are everything to me Frou Frou. If you wanted, you could be my wife. Dear. You are surprised that a man like me speaks like that, right? But what do you want, you gave me what I never had. Happiness. Look into my eyes. Maybe one day a young man... painter or non painter... What are you saying? These are things that often happen to big industrialists. Especially when they leave. Set off? Yes, in a few days, New York. This time I'll be away a lot. Now I understand. Leave quietly. Sure. But if something happened, I would like you to tell me. No deception between us. Promise? No doubt about it... Everything was organized very well. A nice catalog... beautiful gallery... a nice audience. There is all of Paris. And the criticism is completely complete. The buffet is excellent. There is even champagne. Everything is there, only painting is missing. There is also that, unfortunately for him and for us. What do you say? Thanks. Oh for me you know... Painting is what interests me least in vernissages. How I understand you. This I don't mind. Do you think it will hold close to my Rembrandt? With a good nail for sure! It's a two piece of Bercy... Dead leaf... you know, with a color seal... very strange... you don't know how to explain it. Here, see, like that tint there! And to say that according to the newspapers, it had to surprise us. Well to amaze us, it surprised us all right! As for me, it made me stupid. Ladies take a seat please... Oh, see don't push! Don't you worry about leaving some space for others too? Lady, you know how it is, me and the photos... Ladies sorry, but I don't see the artist anymore! But you too lady! Ah no, it is not possible, it is the fourth time that I photograph you! Frou Frou will never come again, she had to go to the jeweler. But apart from the jewelry, did you really find anything for him? Don't move... smile... Mr. Artus, make an effort, smile! Master, your paintings are wonderful. I told my husband I want one! Don't you have anything on the 15 square meters? 15 meters? Yes, it would be for the back wall of our dining room. We love something, we don't know what to do. Put us... you two stuffed! Ready. Ready! No, he got the wrong number. No! No! Manon, don't go, I want to see you tonight. I will wait for you until nine, not a minute longer. I waited for you today, yesterday, the day before yesterday, I've been waiting for you for a month, I can't take it anymore, it's too much! I want to see you, do you understand? If you are not here at nine, I will come to you. Don't tell me I'm crazy, although you do everything you can to make me become. And you know very well that if, I want, I can make him crazy! Remember the evening of the ballol Here I am, are you happy? What do you want? Thanking you. But I owe all of this to you, don't I? It went well? A triumph! How bad? After all I've heard, I don't know if I'm a genius or an imbecile anymore! But if you knew how much I don't care. Why did you change so all of a sudden? What happened, what did I do to you? What did I do to you Manon? Ah no, don't complicate things. I was interested in your paintings and that's it! It's not true. I thought you were smarter. I could give you the same compliment. Meaning? That is... When we love each other like us... it's stupid to waste minutes, hours, days... as if happiness could wait forever. But not! But not! But not... You love Me? You love Me? You love Me!? You won't catch me! You love Me? But yes! A lot... a lot, a lot. Why do you always ask me? You do not believe me? I am no longer young, I am no longer beautiful... - I'm no longer... - What still? You are Manon, my Manon. What I love most in the world. Really? Leave me... What's wrong? - Nothing - You hide something from me. Back? Yup. When? Tomorrow. Did you know that? Yup. Why did not you tell me? What time does it arrive? At four. Are you going to the station? Yup. Quite right... it is he who pays. Why do you say this? It's the truth! But not. Are you crazy? What are you doing here? I have to talk to you. But the train is about to arrive! There's still time. No, no, go away, they can see us! Come on, come on! Come! So what do you have to tell me? I do not want to lose you! But we don't leave ourselves dear! Sharing with him is worse than leaving you. Is there a place here? No sir, all busy. Busy, nice excuse. I thought about us all night. It's simple, you leave it and come with me! With you? I'm sick of Paris, I want to leave. But where? In South America, I leave at the end of the month. But if I told you that these seats are occupied! From who? For me they are free. We can't stay in the corridor, the train is full. Of course, let's go, let's go get our bags. Mom, Minnie Minnie. Give it to me I want it! Give me that! But no it's mine! No it's mine... mom! And stop bickering the two of you, bad, rude. But dear, leaving at the end of the month is not possible! Why? Do you love me yes or no? The train. See you tomorrow dear, wait for me, I will come as soon as I can. No, we'll meet again the day you leave him. It's madness! At the end of the month I leave. Paolo is not possible! Go, go, the train arrives! - Dear... - Go! The train arrives! Then... I got up at five this morning. And then? I am dead tired. And then? And then I can't take it anymore! I work too much Anna Alexandrovna. I have not come to ask you about your health Vladimir Petrovic. How are the horses... Well of course, isn't it? They go very badly, they are worth nothing. Always your mania to say the opposite of what I say, if I say yes you say no. Oh, I should have said that on our wedding day! Oh yes! You would have avoided a great disillusionment! Alas, you are not good for a horse or a woman. Your laziness is disturbing, day and night too. Oh, here comes your ex Frenchman Frou Frou What does that one want? You could at least say goodbye, right? No thanks! I still prefer the revolution. I'm sorry to take away for a moment, your highness, your highness. Oh Frou Frou, you knew, she even managed to make me work. A real imperial tragedy! Poor Vladimir. Your ancestors must be startled. And imagine me! I came to ask you for advice. Sit down. Sabatier wants to marry me. Sabatier? Oh, that's good news, isn't it? Yes, but I love another man. Your painter? Yup. He leaves for Brazil, and I leave with him. Oh, what madness! Maybe, but I love it. And I haven't told you all Vlad. - I'm expecting a baby - Good heavens! Yes, Frou Frou will have a son! It's wonderful isn't it? And does the painter know it? Nobody knows. - Do you always want my advice? - Yup. He marries Sabatier. Marry his money, let that boy go. Let it live as it thinks but you can't. All the more so now that you are expecting a child. But it's his son, Vlad. But he didn't want it, it was you... do you enjoy the idea of ​​starving all three? Paolo will work, he has talent. No talent and you know it. And he knows it too, therefore he runs away, to escape his mediocrity. But I love him, Vlad. There is no love that endures misery, Frou Frou. Don't sacrifice your son, to your pleasure... nor to his, because your happiness will not last long. I'll tell you, and it will end very badly. What you say is terrible. Yes I know. But it is life. Better? Yes thanks. What do you have dear? Nothing, a little tiredness. When we get married, we will live a little quieter. Far from all these people. By the way, I invited American customers tonight. Tell all those crazy people who behave a little better. And make yourself beautiful, I want you to be the most admired. I stop by Cannes, do you need anything? No thanks. See you soon honey. Toh, read. Arrival tonight, greetings Artus. Do you mind? To me? No. He will need another help, and why not? He is not a genius, but he is very nice. Hi. What attitude is it? It seems to be in the court of England. Yes, but tomorrow you will see you will see... We will make up for everything, and how. Tomorrow you will help us too, will you, Mr. Artus? And is it for these idiots that you leave me? Let's go away. So is it not? It's no Paolo. Do you know what you do? My only happiness was you. And you take it. We would starve over there. Are you afraid huh? You don't want to lose the jewelry, the clothes, the Bugatti. They're how you start looking like Frou Frou. If it can raise you insult me, go ahead. I do it for you. So you will have no regrets. Paolo don't torment me... I love you, I love you, I have never loved so much. The gentleman begs the lady to cover herself, the evenings are cool. The gentleman also warns her that the American gentlemen will be leaving shortly. Thanks Josef. Here we go... by American gentlemen, as your butler says. Paolo, I beg you not to leave... At least not tonight, not right away. Well, then tomorrow. Oh yes, tomorrow. Tomorrow. Oh Paul! What happens, why are they shouting? They play pirates lady, they wanted me to be a privateer too, but I allowed myself to refuse. Yes, you are the only reasonable Josef. Yes, the lady and I, if the lady allows we are the only normal people on board. Yup. Silence! Silence! If you all talk together we will never understand each other! Am I the boss yes or no? Yup!!! So shut up! Come come. It's an extraordinary idea! Oh yes yes, let's play pirates. If you knew how fun it is! - Yes, really. - How well he masked us! - Real odalisques! - They came from the East. Do you want to play with us? Oh yes, play too, you'll see how we have fun. He sells us as slaves in Arabia. Explain the game to Frou Frou. Here you go, I'm the Black Pirate. The terror of the seas. This is my emblem. And here's my crew! A bunch of rogues huh guys? Yup! Who are we? What you are always. Slaves! And me? Am I a slave too? You may have been free, but it's a difficult role. Now look like these slaves... which I will sell to the famous Sabatier Pascià. I don't want to be sold, but kidnapped. Silence! Here I am the only one to command! Only one will be saved... the one that has my heart. The one I love! - I! - I! No, you dear lady. - I? - Yup. Not my love? Do not be afraid it will last very little! And then it's for laughing! What do I have to do? Go with the others, come on! In short, enough! Do you pass women yes or no? Cursed dogs! Do you dare to raise your voice with me? How we raise it! Enough with the chatter, you're done! So you give us the bitches? Ldioti, softened, millionaire idiots. But here you exaggerate, how dare you? Oh, he's kidding. So you give these women to us? Back to you! And be careful, the first one who comes forward is a dead man. And I say man please! What if I tell everyone we love each other? Do you want love? No! Don't do it, please I beg you! Oh, the dead rise! I said the dead rise! - Come on, he's defeated now! - You have no escape, give up! Cowards! You won't have me alive, the Black Corsair is unbeatable! Rather death! What a death, I'm all excited! - It almost seems true! - Better than in the cinema! Come on, get up! Get up! Paul. Paul! Paul! How he died is a secret that your father brought with him. But for everyone... he had killed himself for me. I found myself alone again. Alone with you. I sacrificed everything, and since then I have lived only for you! I'm not looking for excuses. What happened is my fault. But I paid. I have wasted my life. I got it all wrong! I didn't know how to be a woman... or a mother Oh no mom, don't say that. Can't you see... and I don't have the strength to hold you back, nor the courage to get you started. Attention Miss Paola Dubois, passenger of Air France flight 052, destination Dakar, please go to customs for formalities... What do you do? But mom, the plane leaves. So, you're leaving. Yes mom. Oh Paola! Do not go! My daughter, I would like to come with you, but... Why are you talking to me like this? But I have to leave mom, tell me yes! I can't, I can't. Forgive me! Paola! Ticket lady.
