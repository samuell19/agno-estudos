Yup, although for being down under, everything is surprisingly right side up. I've wanted to come here ever since I read this fantastic book about the reef. Oh, one of Dr. Martin's books. Now there's a bloke who spends more time underwater than most fish. Well, fortunately he writes better than most of them too. His research institute is attached to the resort, and supposedly guests can dive with, look! We crash, I die happy. It's hard to imagine there's a whole other universe just below the surf... Hey, did you see that? I think I saw someone! ‐ In the water? ‐ Yeah, quick, turn around! Are you sure? We're too far out even for divers. It was just a flash, but I could have sworn. (sighs) Well, I guess 22 hours in a plane is really catching up with me. No worries, the reef is always playing tricks on people. (majestic atmospheric music) (upbeat music) There it is, Hamilton Island. Home to some of the best diving in the world. G'day, welcome to Hamilton Island. ‐ Good day to you too. ‐ Sabrina! ‐ Gwen! Oh, I'm so excited to see you. How long have you been here? I'm telling you, two hours ago my beer can turned into a kangaroo and hopped away! Oh, you're completely daft. About two hours. Gwen, I thought you promised you weren't gonna use your magic this vacation. But I've been practicing. I'm really a lot better than the last time you saw me. Watch. Gwen, no! (whooshing) (twinkles) Wicked, see, told you I've been practicing. Yeah, it'd be perfect if you hadn't just given me a tail. Oh, well, in my defense, I didn't say I was good, I just said I was better. (whooshing) (twinkles) (light atmospheric music) Coming here is the best idea you ever had, Sabrina. This place has absolutely everything! And I mean everything. I know two things it doesn't have, Salem and Stony. I can't believe we've finally managed to escape our furry chaperones. Do you think a week is long enough to rebuild my self‐esteem? SALEM: Finally, a witch‐free week. Saberhagen, you're a genius. (chuckles) You ever seen this Saberhagen guy? Nah, no one has, and he's been coming here for years. What kind of nutcase spends a whole week locked in a hotel room with a mangy cat? ‐ (Salem screeches) ‐ Ah, he bit me! Yeah, well, I'll probably have to get a shot. SALEM: Yeah, right, and I'm gonna need to wash my mouth out. Blech. Hm, note to self. Get a case with more leg room and better movies. (gasps) Hello, paradise. (upbeat music) Hello, paradise. So what are waiting for? Let's get this vacation started. We could go windsurfing, hiking, snorkeling, waterskiing. Okay, but the first thing we have to do is find the dive shop. Oh, yeah. Did I mention they have snorkeling? Front desk. SALEM: Manager, please. Mr. Saberhagen, I didn't realize you'd arrived. Why didn't somebody tell me Mr. Saberhagen had arrived? Nice fruit basket, though you cheaped out on the macadamia nuts. I'll send someone up immediately. I need nuts! You remember the drill, don't you, Davie? Of course, no one is ever to enter your room unannounced, and your cat Salem has complete and total access to the resort. The staff have already been alerted. Alert the staff! Your cat's every whim is our desire. Like it! Remind me to needlepoint that on a pillow. Now patch me through to room service, pronto. (upbeat music) Yeah, Sabrina, I'd like you to meet Jerome. Jerome, this is Sabrina. Pleasure, Sabrina. I was just telling your pommy‐cobby here that I was afraid there might be too many steak and kidneys about, but not the case, eh? I'll pop and get us some lolly water. Hey, roo. Doesn't he have the cutest accent? I can't understand a thing he says, can you? No. I was hoping you could! Sorry. But who cares? He's got dimples the size of coconuts. (both giggle) (upbeat music) ‐ Excellent. ‐ There you go. ‐ Cheers, mate. ‐ Cheers. There you go. Ah! Fruity, tropical. (groans) It's cold! Brain freeze, oh! Brain freeze. Whoo! Oh, cheers! You know, I could go for a bite, what say you two? Sammy's or dog's eyes? I'm sorry, a little slower and in English? Preferably the Queen's. (background commotion) SNORKLER: Let go of me! (shouting over each other) How'd you like it if somebody swimmin' in your house and broke up your house! Well you'll know how it feels if I ever catch you on my reef again! Hey! It's him, it's Dr. Martin! The marine biologist? Sounds as mad a gumtree full of gallars. He's not crazy, he's brilliant! He's the one who wrote the book that I sent you, remember? Didn't you just love... You never read it, did you? I meant to, really, but I've been busy! Well you try and find a decent bathing suit in London! Here. Dr. Martin, hi, I'm Sabrina. I'm a huge fan of yours and um, well actually I was thinking about becoming‐‐ Look at this. (chuckles) They were gonna sell it. Probably to some idiot who wanted it just because it matched their drapes. Becoming a marine biologist and I was just wondering‐‐ Break it right off. Do you have idea how long it takes for this stuff to grow? I think it's gelateria, one of the slowest‐growing corals, so probably about, 300 years? That's right. What did you say your name was? Sabrina. Julian Martin. I get a little worked up when people mess with my reef. A marine biologist, huh? Thinkin' about it. Well hopefully my tirade hasn't dissuaded you. You know, I'm leading a dive expedition tomorrow and I'd be honored if you would‐‐ Oh, first name on the list. (peaceful music) Hurry up! Why? The fish aren't even awake yet! Ah, morning, Gwen! Jerome! Nothing like an exhilarating dive to start your day. Practically had to toss my roommate out of bed! (energetic rock music) Your pineapple punch. Sir. When you're done here, that crazy lady's Persian needs another shrimp cocktail. (waiter chuckles) This is what I get for being a cat person, huh? (sighs) Persian?

Salem Saberhagen. And I couldn't help noticing we have a lot in common. We wear the same brand of sunglasses, and we're both people trapped in the body of a cat. I'm Hilary, and at the risk of starting a conversation, what gave me away? I don't know, maybe a certain something in your eye? Or that copy of Vogue you're reading. So what do you say, Hilary? You, me, the sea, the moon, some cat nip? You know what I say, Salem? Yes? I say, I didn't fall for creeps like you when I was a woman so I'm certainly not gonna fall for them now that I'm a cat. I'll take that as a maybe! Oh, shrimp! (playful music) (Sabrina gasps) Only one drawback to being a fish. (spits) Salt water, bleugh! Hm. The blue spot butterfly fish! Hey, don't you know you're supposed to be extinct? Fish. Cute, but lousy conversationalists. Hey, little fish! Come back, I just wanna... (tense music) Huh? (gasps) (screams) Ow. Hey! Excuse me. Oh, pardon me. Hey, hey watch the fin, buddy! Whoo, this fish business is harder than I thought. With the eels and the sharks and the, (gasps) shark! (suspenseful music) (peaceful music) Woo! Two snaps away from being the catch of the day. Oh! Hey! I'd be much more upset if this didn't tickle so much. Woo! I didn't know you could get seasick under water. Oh! Oh, no you don't. (whooshing) (twinkles) Bully! (relaxing music) Sabrina's so good! With my luck I would have turned myself into the Loch Ness Monster! (screams) (man screams) Oh! What a fun way to say hello. Where I'm from, we usually just shake hands. I'm sorry. You startled me! Well, I'm startled to meet you too. I'm Barnaby. Gwen. What happened to your shoulder? Did you brush up against some coral? Uh no, it's kind of why... Gwen! Sabrina! You'll never guess what I found. I'd like you to meet Barn... niby? Barnaby, Jerome, aren't there any guys in England? But! He... Probably really cute, come on! We gotta go find Dr. Martin. (upbeat music) ‐ Anything else, Miss Hexton? ‐ No. Now be good a boy and toddle along. Surprise! (Hilary gasps) What are you doing here? What are you wearing? Get out! (melancholic music) (Salem sobs) I wish I could remember why that seemed like such a good idea. (sobs) She hates me. Dr. Martin, you'll never guess what I saw. Ceridon Pelivius. What, the blue spot butterfly fish? ‐ Sabrina, that fish is‐‐ ‐ Extinct, I know! Are you sure? Yellow with the blue oval vertical black bend through the eye and mouth and a false eye on the tail? I saw a bunch of shiny yellow ones! (energetic rock music) Is this what you saw? Exactly, although it's a lot smaller in person. Incredible, no one has seen that fish for 50 years. And I still can't figure out how you did. They live deep down inside the reef, never out in the open. Oh, well I guess this one got lost. (chuckles) You understand we're gonna have to verify the sighting. SABRINA: Is that you? Years ago. Spent a lot of time between Russian harpoons and whales. Foolish, but worth it. Julian! We have another dolphin beached over at Paradise Cove. Looks fairly critical. What's wrong? The abnormally‐high toxin level in the water on the other side of the island is causing some of the larger marine mammals to get sick and die. Die? Is there anything you can do? Well if we're lucky to get to them early enough, they stand a good chance, but dolphins and whales aren't great about seeking medical attention. They become weak and disorientated and they're susceptible to predators. It's usually accompanied by a rash on their fins and tails. But what's causing it? (Julian sighs) Well I'm fairly certain that a ship has recently begun illegally dumping its waste into the ocean, but I don't have any proof. The resort is fanatical about prosecuting offenders but, it's almost impossible to catch them in the act. I'll talk to you later about your fish. (phone rings) Hello, Hilary? No, I'm sorry, but Miss Hexton has sent back your very generous gift. I know it's none of my business, sir, but, might I suggest, next time you try flowers? [Salem] Okay, thank you. (sobs) (Sabrina and Gwen giggle) What a smashing holiday this has turned out to be. You find a supposedly extinct fish, and I might have a boyfriend! The odds of either are incredible. What's that? Oh, no! I think it's a dolphin! (dark atmospheric music) Gwen, it's not a dolphin. (music swells) (dark atmospheric music) Barnaby? Sabrina! It's the guy I was talking to on the reef! I had no idea he was a mer... Man. Oh and the giant fish tail didn't you at all suspicious? Help me try to find a pulse. What's the matter with him? Is he gonna be all right? I don't know but he's still breathing or whatever it is merguys do. We have to try to revive him somehow. GWEN: Did that help? Yeah, I was getting a little hot. I was thinking more along the lines of mouth‐to‐gill resuscitation? (bubbling water) Spout, we're too late, humans have him. What are we gonna do? I don't know if we should be forcing water into his lungs or out of them. I really think he needs to be back in the water. You can't just roll him back into the ocean, he'll drown! Or maybe he's drowning now! People! Okay, this isn't gonna be easy to explain. (whooshing) (twinkles) I didn't know they could do that. (whooshing) Quick, let's get him to the tub. (maid screams) (splashing) (maid yelps) What have you been practicing, the piano? You really should get that air conditioner fixed, it's been drippin' all day. (chuckles) ‐ (playful music) ‐ (grunts) Got him? Can you believe it? Just a hot dog and a piece of string. Dear, Aunt Eunice. Having a wonderful time, thrilled you're not here. Huh? Sabrina, be careful! He's slippery. Sabrina? Salem? My kingdom for a sushi shub. Nice fish. Hurry, we've gotta get him into some water. Bend with the knees! And this better not take long, I've got a massage in 20 minutes. SABRINA: Ah! That's a shower! GWEN: Sorry! Hello? Salem? (Gasps) Hilary? I wanted to apologize for earlier. My therapist says I can be a little judgmental, and you seem like a decent flea‐free guy. I'll get the magic book! Salem, I need salt and lots of it. Who has a room full of women. There's a very simple explanation! Wow, this place is messier than your place at home. Do you think this is enough? Does it sound like the water's overflowing? Just not one I can think of at the moment. Excuse me. Not a problem, I was just leaving. (Salem stammers) SALEM: No, Hilary, don't go! A random talking cat, I'd be a little bit more curious if I didn't have an unconscious merman in the bathtub. I've got it! There's a whole chapter on sea creatures! SALEM: Well, I hope you're happy. I can't believe you came halfway around the world to destroy my vacation. I came halfway around the world to get away from you! Don't try and sweet talk me now. I thought you took your vacations on Nantucket. That's just what I tell people. ‐ I value my privacy. ‐ So do I! Why do you think I've been talking about coming here for months? I even gave you that book to read about this place! Oh, never read it. At least I'm not the only one. But I am using it to press flowers. Now kindly get the comatose fishboy out of my tub and get off my island. ‐ Your island? ‐ He's waking up! The salt water's working! (Barnaby gasps) (splashing water) BARNABY: Who are you? Calm down, quit splashing! He's getting water everywhere. (Barnaby groans) Your animal, it talks! Yeah, but he never has much to say. Barnaby, don't you remember me? Gwen, we met on the reef? Oh, yeah. Startled to see you again. We're trying to help you, we found you washed up on the beach and we brought you back to our tub. My tub, which now smells like old tuna. Oh. The last thing I remember is being chased by a boat. Normally I'd have no trouble getting away, but I've been so tired. Well why were you even swimming around out there? I thought mythical creatures were supposed to keep hidden. Ask any unicorn. Well actually, it's forbidden to have contact with leg‐walkers, humans. I was gonna ask you for help but, I got scared when she showed up. I tried again with the next group I found but, they weren't as nice. Is it about your shoulder? Looks like some sort of fungus. I thought it was a bruise. No, there's more on his tail, look. Do you live on the other side of the island? Sabrina, how'd you know all this? This is what Dr. Martin's been telling me all about. He has all the symptoms. Barnaby, if you don't get it treated right away it could be‐‐ Fatal, I know. Well that's why I didn't think I had anything to lose. We've gotta find a way to get Dr. Martin to look at him. Sabrina, I might not have noticed his tail straight away but I'm pretty that Dr. Martin will. He is a scientist, after all. Unless... Barnaby, the rest of the world might not be as comfortable with your tail as we are. But there may be a way to, change it. See, there's a whole bunch of forces that make up the Universe. Circumstances that can't be easily explained. And while we may look like a bunch of normal leg‐walkers, ‐ we're... ‐ Unique. Oh, for the love of, they're witches! ‐ Salem! ‐ (Barnaby laughs) Witches, yeah right! What do you take me for, a sea slug? (laughs) Even I know witches don't exist. (whooshing) (twinkles) You know, for a guy with a tail, you're extremely narrow‐minded. (playful music) Serpents, sea monsters, sirens, a recipe for buliabase. There! Mermaids! Oh, I don't know about this one, Sabrina. There's no reversing spell! Sabrina, hurry up! (Salem moans) I don't like the way your cat is looking at me! Maybe broiled with a little garlic butter. No! Smothered in cornbread batter and deep‐fried. Look, he's starting to foam at the mouth! Actually, brainiac's been eatin' soap. Kinda tastes like starfish. It's not for eating! Okay, we found a spell that'll give you legs for 48 hours. Legs, really? You mean like the two of you? Hopefully not just like the two of them, or you'll be headlining in the Sydney production of Victor Victoria. Once we've changed you, the spell can't be reversed. You have to let it run its course. So? I always wondered what it would be like to have legs. I'm ready when you are. Give him a towel. Spoil sport. Water and sand, land and air, give me a male with legs to spare. (whooshing) (twinkles) Look, I've got legs! Look at me, I'm standing! Oh, sure. The fish gets to be a man, but the cat? No! (playful music) (Chuckles) They might look ridiculous but they seem to work pretty well! Hey. ‐ What are these? ‐ Pockets! You know, you put things in 'em like gum, keys. Garbage. This is the most incredible place I've ever seen. BIKER: Crazy congo, watch where you're goin'! Oh, okay you don't need to add any of those words to your vocabulary. SALEM: Now might be a bad time to mention, I'm afraid of heights. (sobs) MAN: Come on, mate, put it down. Look! Sorry. Surfer, one too many boogie boards to the head. ‐ Wait, what's that? ‐ Look, look. Be fascinated in this direction, okay? Dum de dum dum dum. Whoa! Now that's a mouse. G'day mate! Hey, that's my sandwich! (sobs) Bully. What have they done to him? They've turned him to some kind of mutant. Spout! No, come back! (Spout squeaks) Spout! This is spout! Spout, Sabrina and Gwen. We've met. Hi. Pleasure. I know, they're pretty cute. What? Fin? My sister, Fin! Look, aren't they great? They're disgusting. Make them change you back I can't even stand to look at you. Come on, Fin, be reasonable. They're just tryin' to help. (dark music) Sorry you had to hear that. She's not the biggest fan of humans. (Sighs) I know if I suddenly saw my brother with legs, I'd be a little upset too. Currently, he's a tree. Don't ask. Mother still hasn't forgiven me. Maybe she'll change her opinion once we get you to a doctor. What is this, some kind of joke? It's not a joke, I took the pictures myself. We were out looking for your blue spot butterfly fish when this, this thing just appeared. It's gotta be some play of light, it's a dolphin. Nah, it's not a dolphin! We chased it for over half an hour. And where do you think it was heading? ASSISTANT: Got no idea, could be anywhere. I don't know if somebody's having a huge laugh at our expense or we really have mermaids swimming around out there. But I'll tell you one thing, I'm gonna find it. SABRINA: Excuse me, Dr. Martin? (playful music) (upbeat percussive music) You got this anywhere else? Yeah, I have some on my tail. Bone, uh, his tailbone and uh, some on his legs too! I don't believe it. But I think you might be right, Sabrina. This appears to be almost identical to what's been affecting the marine mammals. And you said you could treat it, right? If you catch it in time? I said we've had some success with dolphins and whales. But if it's the same disease, then wouldn't it work on a mer, uh, Barnaby? This is beginning to affect humans. Why haven't we seen it before? Uh, so what do you use, an ointment, an antibiotic, a shot? What? To cure it. An ointment. Great! So let's try it and see if it works. If it does, great. If it doesn't, well, let's hope it does. Sabrina! Barnaby? I think I have some water in my ear. Oh, (chuckles) swimmer's ear, he's always in the water. It's probably how this happened in the first place. (gushing water) Phew. That's better. Oh, look! (twinkles) You got a leak in one of your fish tanks. Well, um... Thanks for lookin' at him, really appreciate it. Gotta go. Oh and uh, you might wanna... Okay well, that went well. At least up until you turned into a giant fountain. Are you sure whatever you saw had a tail? I'm positive, you've got the pictures, why? There's some discoloration on the left shoulder. They're almost identical to marks on the guy that Sabrina just brought in. (suspenseful music) Against my better judgement, I'll believe your story ‐ and accept your apology. ‐ Thank you. Besides, I'm bored out of my whiskers and you're the only other talking cat on this rock. In other words, beggars can't be choosers. Correct. Yes! I knew you'd come around. Once every two hours and by tomorrow you should be as good as new. Do you mind if I pop out for a bit? I'm finally gonna get that windsurfing lesson. Do I have to stay in here to make this stuff work? I don't think so, why? 'Cause I got legs and 48 hours to use 'em! Let's go!

Oh, she likes me, she really likes me! I mean... See you at eight. Mm. What do you call this stuff again? ‐ Ice cream. ‐ It's great. Better than squid guts. (upbeat music) (cheering) Thank you everything, Sabrina. Today's really been magical. Yeah, I was just thinkin' the same thing. What? I don't know how humans show affection. We touch tails when we wanna show that we care for someone. Oh, well we hug. You know, wrap our arms around each other. Or, we kiss. Kiss? Yeah, we touch our lips together. ‐ Really? ‐ (Sabrina chuckles) Yeah, it doesn't sound quite as romantic when you have to explain it. Do you have someone back home you do that with? Yeah, I do. Well he's very lucky. Thanks. Oh, and trust me, the kissing part, it grows on you. (Spout squeaks) Spout! Oh you're not gonna believe the day I've had, it's been‐‐ (Spout clicks and squeaks) What? How bad? What's the matter? What's he squeaking? It's Fin, she's sick! Such a barnacle sometimes! Here I am thinking only of myself running around these stupid... I've gotta go to her. Barnaby! But I can't swim. Sabrina, you have change me back, now. I can't. The spell won't reverse itself for another 36 hours. I'm sorry. But, the medicine worked on you, it should work on her as well. She'll never come here. What if I took it to her? You'd do that? Oh, Sabrina, thank you! What's the matter? Aren't I doing it right? No, it's fine! But, I think you just poured ice cream down my back. Oh. (peaceful music) Maybe I should just tell Dr. Martin about Barnaby. I know he'd do everything he could to help. And how are you gonna explain about the legs? It'd be the same as telling him you're a witch! You can't. I know. All right, go get Barnaby, I'll meet you at the dock. (suspenseful music) Shoot. There goes the "it just fell into my bag" excuse. (twinkles) Dr. Martin, you're up early. I just needed more ointment. I could see that. Your friend's still sick? No, he's a lot better but I, I found a dolphin I thought could use some. A dolphin. They're seeking you out for medical advice now. If other things are coming down with this... I just wish you thought you could trust me, Sabrina. I do trust you, it's just... I wouldn't do this if it wasn't really important. Well we don't want any sick dolphins swimming around, but I think I've got some more of this in my office. (suspenseful music) (bleeping) Hope you didn't mind having to share a room with Salem. Of course, no one's concerned that gill‐breath here kept me up half the night snoring. No, we had a great time, I love pay‐per‐view. Way to play it cool, merboy. Okay, I got it. Where's Spout? (Barnaby whistles loudly) Dolphins have the worst sense of time. I think I speak for all of us when I say, ow. (Spout squeaks) (splashing) Hang on. He'll get you there in no time. Dolphin, it's the only way to travel! I wish I had a dolphin to ride. Hm? Can't be too hard, can it? Sabrina always says it's just a matter of concentration. (whooshing) (twinkles) (Salem sobs) [Salem] Not good! (splashing) Oh. Frizzle. (energetic music) (peaceful music) MERMAN: Hey, leg‐walker! Don't go away! Barnaby sent me! I'm here to help! (twinkling) (bleeping) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) Barnaby sent me to help! I have medicine! You're not being very hospitable. Fin! FIN: We don't need your help. Fin, your tail, you're sick. I said we don't need you here. Barnaby jeopardized the whole colony when he revealed himself to humans. I'm not like every other human. I have secrets of my own. You can trust me. Nothing will ever be the same. I'd rather die than have you perform your sorcery on me. Healing the sick is still done the old‐fashioned way. No magic. Well we weren't sick until humans showed up on our island. The people on the island aren't causing you to get sick. They're trying to put a stop to it right now. Fin, I don't know how to make you understand, but I promise you that nothing bad will happen to you, your brother or your colony, you have my word. Is Barnaby really okay? He's great. He got his strength back and his shoulder's almost completely cleared up. He'll be home tomorrow. May I? Fine. But if I somehow end up with legs, you're in big trouble. (Sabrina chuckles) That lagoon's completely inaccessible to boats. She certainly didn't have any problem. I'll find a way in. Call the Sydney Aquarium. See if they got a tank I can use. Just in case I find anything out there. Wanna make sure I've got a place to keep it. (suspenseful music) (upbeat music) There, all done. I'll leave the rest of this with you. Hopefully I can find some more to send back with Barnaby. Thanks for helping, Sabrina. Sorry I've been so difficult. That's all right, I'll be the first to admit we're not the easiest species to get along with. (Fin chuckles) Oh, where are my manners? You want something to eat? You must be famished. Actually, I am a little hun... Full, from breakfast. Are you sure? It's delicious. Never been so sure in my life. (playful music) Sabrina, you've been gone for hours. We were starting to get worried. Once that Fin lets her scales down, she turns into a real talker. She wasn't telling stories, was she? Maybe. Let's just say Barnaby here went through a really awkward phase. (Gwen giggles) You're Salem's tormentors, right? Have you seen him lately? I've been gone all day. He just sort of disappeared. We thought he was spending the day with you. Well, we have a confirmed dinner reservation, so I'm sure I'll see him then. Ta. She sure was right about the hot dog. Yeah, but that's gotta be the ugliest fish I've ever‐‐ (spraying water) SALEM: You ain't too easy on the eyes yourself. (gentle piano music) (faint chatter) Would you like to hear the specials? No, I don't suppose you do. Your owner already called in your order. I'll send a waiter right... Why am I even talking to you? (sighs) Wow, I was asking myself that same question. Hm, he's late, and I didn't hear from him once today. More than curiosity is going to kill that cat if he stands me up. Unless we can figure out who and what is making you all sick and stop it, the ointment isn't gonna do much good. But you said that Dr. Martin thinks the toxins are caused by illegal dumping. Yeah but it could take months to catch whoever's doing it. We talked about moving the colony. We got nowhere we'd go. We're very protected here, or we had been. Maybe you're right, Sabrina. I don't know if we can do this without Dr. Martin's help. Good evening. If you'd like to follow me, you may select a fish from our tank and we'll prepare it to order. Okay, we're all set, though I had to do a little fast talkin' when they asked what you needed the tank for. I've gone over all the charts and I think I've found a way into the lagoon. We're gonna have to dive but we can still take nets, video equipment. Are you sure we should be talking about this in here? You afraid the cat's gonna tell someone? Oh, like the cat gives a flying fig what you're talking about. Men, I swear they think the world revolves around them. I feel kinda weird. What if these are some of the fish I met yesterday? This one. Oh uh, excellent choice, sir. May I take that for you? ‐ Uh no, I'm fine. ‐ Uh, Barnaby. Give the fish to the man. Choices, choices. SALEM: Boo! (Gwen gasps and screams) ‐ Gwen, what's the matter? ‐ Look! SALEM: Sabrina! (whooshing) (twinkles) (splashing) You could have gotten me out of the tank first. (patrons murmuring) Uh, I think I'll just have a salad. I'm wet, and smell like fish. I've lost the woman of my dreams and she ate all the bread sticks. (sobs) (phone rings) (peaceful music) Hilary? Finally! I've been calling for three hours straight. I was gettin' worried that you were avoiding me! ‐ (high‐pitched chatter) ‐ Oh, you were. I'm sorry for standing you up tonight, but there's a very simply explanation, I‐‐ (high‐pitched chatter) Yes, it's better than my merman in the bathtub excuse. (stammers) I was accidentally turned into a catfish and‐‐ ‐(engaged tone) ‐ Hello. Hello. (sobs) No, no. Pick up! (suspenseful music) Thank you, thank you, thank you for finally forgiving me. [Hilary] If you're trying to apologize for last night, getting me up before dawn to walk to the other side of the island isn't cutting it. I promise, it'll be worth it. Tada! We're here, one perfect sunrise. Oh, Salem. It's glorious. Okay, let's get a couple of shots for the folks back home. Say Salem is super! How about I stick with cheese? Although, Salem is pretty cute. (Salem chuckles) SALEM: Hold it. (camera clicks) Barnaby turns back into a merman today. Are you gonna be okay with that? Yeah, I just wish there was more we could do. What? Well, I decided I'm gonna talk to Dr. Martin. He's a scientist, right? He'll be rational. Anyway, I have to ask him for more ointment. ‐ I promised Fin that... ‐ (bleeping) ‐ What's that? ‐ I don't know. Looks like a tracking device. The kind they tag whales with to follow them. You don't think he put that in your bag on purpose do you? I don't know how else it could have gotten in there. Then he knows where the colony is! Find Barnaby. Now I definitely have to talk to Dr. Martin. (suspenseful music) Hello? Dr. Martin? Dr. Martin! Mm‐Hm. Hm. I don't know about you, but I think they're kinda arty. Hey, have either of you seen Dr. Martin? Whoa. These are almost as bad as the picture you took for last year's Christmas card, nothin' but knees. I heard your doctor friend talk about storming some lagoon this morning. He was quite full of himself. Oh no, I hope it's not too late. Hey. Can I keep this one? Thanks, gotta go. Is she always like this? Pretty much. SABRINA: Dr. Martin? Dr. Martin. Sabrina, good morning. Just heading out to verify your Ceridon Pelivius sighting. I'll let you know if we have any luck. You're not going out to look for my fish, unless you think it's in a lagoon on the other side of the island. It seems you're always one step ahead of us, Sabrina. Why would you do this? You weren't honest with me so I wasn't honest with you. Sorry, but you made the rules. This isn't a game! You can't go there, please you don't know what you're doing. I know more about this reef than you could ever hope to know. If there is something out there, I'm gonna find it. And thanks to you, I know the first place I'm gonna look. I'm not gonna let you do this. I would like to see you try and stop me. Go, go! Watch me. (suspenseful music) Sabrina. Sabrina. Is it true? Does he know where the colony is? ‐ Yeah, but‐‐ ‐ You can't just stand here. You gotta do something! I can't even swim there to try and warn 'em. Please, change me back. I don't wanna be a man. There's less than an hour before the spell reverses itself just calm down, okay? We're not gonna let anything happen to the colony. I say we zap in a tsunami or maybe a giant squid! Just, brain‐storming. I can't even see the boat anymore. Maybe I could see 'em from the lookout. Barnaby, wait! He's really getting the hang of those things. (sighs) I wish we could just conjure up a huge storm. That would keep them away from the lagoon. ‐ Gwen, that's a great idea! ‐ Really? Yeah, it's perfect, come on. I've wanted to try this spell since I got my license. Now this is what I call heaven. You, me. Alone with 11 picnic baskets and now‐‐ Distractions? Pay no attention to fishboy. More pate, hm? Sabrina, are you sure about this? Weather spells can be very dangerous. Of course I'm sure! Well, pretty sure. I can at least try, can't I? Well, be careful. (suspenseful music) Waves to toss with violent motion, squall upon a tranquil ocean, clouds and rain, thunder and lightning, give me a storm that's truly frightening. (rumbling) (twinkles) GWEN: Wicked, Sabrina, you did it! BARNABY: Wow. Sabrina created a huge storm. (cracking and rumbling thunder) Where did that come from? We can't take this kind of weather. We're gonna have to turn around. (rumbling thunder) Yeah! Hoo‐hoo, they're turning around! So! Read any good books lately? You did it! They're coming back! See? Nothing to it, I don't know what you were so worried‐‐ (cracking thunder) (screams) Sabrina! Salem, something's wrong with Sabrina! What's the matter? I think she's hurt. (muffled chatter) Follow me! I'm sorry, but‐‐ Just go already! I, I love you. What did he say? Oh please, just this once. (whooshing) (twinkles) Oh, thank goodness we're not in Greenland. Go! What's the matter with this stupid animal? It's lazier than a sea cow! Turn it on! The key. Turn the key, bait‐head! (car starts) Just release that handle. Hm‐hm, then push down the paddle to your... (screams) (tires screech) Scratch that! Turn the wheel! The other way! Where am I? What happened? We're back in the room. You blasted yourself right out of the ocean! But don't worry, you'll be all right. You just need a little rest. But it worked? Yes, but that spell has three pages of warnings attached to it, the first of which, don't stand in the water. I knew I was forgetting something. My neck is killing me. That should pass, but the electric charge is gonna interfere with your magic for a couple of hours! Well, hopefully if the storm worked, I won't need it for a while. (Salem sobs) Just my luck, I meet the woman of my dreams, then I die in a fiery car crash. ‐ Look out! ‐ (blaring card horn) (screeching tires) Let's go, hurry up, come on! We've gotta secure the Institute before the storm hits! Thanks. I'm already feelin' a little bit better. Is that the time? BOTH: Barnaby! I knew I could tame this beast. Hm. ‐ Huh? ‐ (twinkles) Uh‐oh! (whooshing) Get your smelly flipper out of my, look out! (screeching tires) Brakes. Brakes! Brakes! No. (sobs) (screeching tires) Phew. Hey, doc. Shoulder's really doin' a lot better. (dark atmospheric music) (excited background chatter) Where's everyone going? Barnaby! Where is he? He knows this is the first place we'd look for him. Sea monster's back, least we won't have to worry about Dr. Martin for a while. SALEM: (grunts) Think again! ‐ Salem, what happened? ‐ Oh, Sabrina, it was awful. I may never ride in a car again. I meant to Barnaby. Oh, Martin captured him and has him locked up in the resort swimming pool. ‐ We've gotta go get him out. ‐ Sabrina, is it true? Have they captured Barnaby? I was worried when he didn't come back. ‐ Yes it's true but‐‐ ‐ But you promised that nothing would happen to him. To us. ‐ You gave me your word. ‐ Sabrina, look, I think it's a news helicopter. I'm gonna be on television. Fin, I'm sorry. Barnaby was a fool to have trusted you. Let's just hope I can save the rest of us. (dramatic music) (murmuring crowd) JULIAN: Excuse me. ‐ Excuse me. ‐ (splashing) How's he doin'? Fine, he's got a delightful sense of humor. Made the arrangements. The transportation to Sydney's on its way, and CNN just landed. What? Stupid earpiece. This is Wally Gilliams reporting live from the Hamilton Island Resort on the Great Barrier Reef where we have just received unconfirmed reports that noted marine biologist Dr. Julian Martin has captured what observers say can only be described as, a merman. Now, details about this purported half‐man, half‐fish, are a bit sketchy at this time, however we will keep you updated as more information becomes available. (crowd murmuring) Who told you to call the press? This is my show! And it's my pool. If you really have a merthing in there, then this resort is definitely showing the prize. We'll never be able to get him out through this crowd. Maybe if we go around the other side. Salem, go find him and see if he's okay. [Salem] You can count on, oh, macadamia nuts! Go! G'day, Gwen, I've been lookin' all over for ya. Gwen, we're in a hurry, remember? I'm not gonna confirm or deny anything. I'll be right back. Excuse me a moment. Sabrina. I suppose we have you to thank and to blame for all this. Who's the poacher now, Dr. Martin? ‐ (Gwen laughs) ‐ Gwen, we have to go. Sabrina, Jerome was just telling me the funniest... I've gotta go. What are you sheilas lookin' at me so funny for? At this point, Dr. Martin is answering all reporters' questions with a flat "no comment" so therefor we are still unable to substantiate any reports that in fact a merman has been captured. We can tell you, however, that the mystery seems to revolve around the resort's pool where it has become clear that in fact some thing or someone is being kept from public view. Just recently the entire pool area was closed down to all the guests and all the media without explanation. This reporter seriously doubts if the anxious crowds can be kept away much longer. (dramatic music) Salem, finally. Where's Sabrina, is she all right? She's fine, but her magic's a little out of whack. She's gonna get me out of here, isn't she? Uh, sure. Just keep telling yourself that. [Hilary] Salem? Hilary? I figure, why keep fighting it? Is there anything I can do? Hey, you cats, get away from there! Find Sabrina, tell her five minutes, north gate, I'll distract the guard. HILARY: I think I love you too! What did she say? Hello, Sabrina, Hilary. I don't think we've ever really been properly introduced. Charmed, don't mean to be rude, but I'm kinda in the middle of a crisis here. Oh, right. Salem said he'll distract the guard. You should be able to get in on the north end of the pool. Well, great, let's go! (crowd murmuring) Tell the Governor that we can't wait any longer. ‐ All right, if everybody's‐‐ ‐ Listen! I told you, this is a matter of significant scientific importance, you can't go out there! Well, I'd like to see you try and stop me. (crowd murmuring) ♪ My Bonnie lies over the ocean ♪ ♪ My Bonnies lies over the sea ♪ Is this your idea of a joke? Sabrina. ♪ So bring my Bonnie to me ♪ (crowd murmuring) Wait here! I'll be right back. Where are you going? You can't do this! (dramatic music) There's only one place they can be heading, the dock. Hold on! Sabrina, look out! ASSISTANT: There they are! (suspenseful music) (splashing) ‐ (Sabrina giggles) ‐ (Gwen cheers) Better luck next time. I was just gonna say the same thing to you. (suspenseful music) We've gotta get out to that boat. Quickly, I think the crowd's headed this way! MAN: Hurry! (Spout squeaks) Spout! My favorite taxi service. Meet me out there. (splashing) (peaceful music) Hey, how am I supposed to meet you out there? You just took the last dolphin! Oh, right! It's worth a shot. I am kind of on a roll. (twinkles) (whooshing) Yes! Frizzle. (splashing) (suspenseful music) Okay, Spout? I need you to do me one more favor. (Spout squeaks) You swam? I was afraid I wasn't getting enough exercise this holiday. (splashing) Game's over, Sabrina. You're very clever but nobody makes a fool of me on my reef. Julian? I think we've got him. This'll give those roovs back the resort ‐ something to write about! ‐ You can't do this! Fin! Sabrina! What's happening? Why are you doing this? No! Over here! Take me! FIN: No! Barnaby, go away, get out of here! See if we can get a net around that one too! ‐ Sabrina, look! ‐ (Spout squeaks) SABRINA: Spout, did you find it? It's your fish! Ceridon Pelivius. Incredible, it's beautiful. Sabrina, be careful, we don't wanna hurt it. Quick, somebody get a bucket! Actually, I was thinking about stuffing it and hanging it on my wall. Now I'll have something to show the press back at the dock too. Don't worry, your little analogy isn't lost on me. But this isn't the same thing. ‐ I'm trying to protect‐‐ ‐ What? Your ego? Your reputation? Sabrina, nobody cares more about this reef than I do. SABRINA: I'm not gonna let you do this. ‐ What are you doing? ‐ Hurry, Sabrina! Fin, get ready to swim. Sabrina! Drop the knife. No. You think I'm gonna let you destroy the greatest discovery of this century? Do you think I'm gonna let you destroy their lives? This reef doesn't belong to you, it belongs to them. By the way, how does it feel to be on the other side? (melancholic music) Thank you. I can just go after them again, you know. If you meant that, you never would have let me cut the rope. Don't be so sure of yourself, Sabrina. (crowd murmuring) (Sabrina chuckles) And don't be so sure of me. The only thing I'm sure of, is that you would never let anyone hurt any living creature on this reef. You've dedicated your whole life to the ocean. (buzzing helicopter blades) And what have I got to show for it? (chuckles) Everything. Everything. (crowd murmuring) Can't ask for much more than that now, can I? Finally, some answers. Dr. Martin, you clearly told me you'd made a find of monumental importance. I know I have a lot to answer for. First let me say how sorry I am that‐‐ You had to wait. This is what he wanted to show you. The blue spot butterfly fish. Pretty cool, huh? Nobody's seen one for 50 years. Yeah but Sabrina‐‐ You got us out here for some four‐inch fish? I thought you said they had a mermaid. Mermaid? You must be from one of the tabloids. Don't you get it? Something we thought was gone forever is back! It's incredible. I have the coastguard on their way here now. Seems a bit like overkill, but they could help us ‐ corden off the area. ‐ What? Why? You can't do that! Thanks to my new friend here, I can. The National Endangered Species Act requires that the entire eastern end of the island be reclassified as a preservation zone. Entry into the area is completely prohibited. Except for scientific research. But it's such a small fish! This small fish has created a great deal of excitement among local environmentalists, although not a merman as some other less reliable news sources may have led you to believe, it is still a discovery of, uh, some importance. For example, the Great Barrier Reef marine park authority has classified its habitat as a preservation zone, thus ensuring the blue spot butterfly fish will no longer face extinction. Hilary, I know we've only just met, but I think you feel the same way about me as I do about you. No, don't speak. Hilary... Will you marry me? Oh, yes, Salem! I'd love to. (laughs) Oh. But of course, with a face like this, how could she possibly say no? (chuckles) ‐ ♪ Could it be you ♪ ‐ (door unlocks) ♪ Could you be the one ♪ ♪ That makes me feel ♪ Hilary? Hilary, what's the matter, why are you leaving? Is it something I said? My breath? HILARY: Salem, I'm sorry. I was hoping I wouldn't have to say goodbye like this. Apparently you weren't planning on saying goodbye at all. Salem, I haven't been honest with you. I'm already a woman. Meowow! Oh. I know I should have told you. This trip was to celebrate the end of my sentence. It expired today. I don't have to be a cat anymore. I'm a witch again. That's perfect! I can come live with you and in 87 years I'll be a man‐‐ Salem, this is goodbye. I'm really more of a dog person. But you said you loved me. Oh, I know. I must have been caught up in the moment. My therapist says I have a real problem with that. (melancholic music) (Salem sobs) Hey. You okay? I'll be all right. He said he'd write to me every day. Or maybe it was something about soccer. I never could understand that accent. Come on, Dr. Martin's about to make his announcement. Since we have you all here, we wanted to let you in on another little discovery that we made yesterday. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of one of our most loyal guests, Mr. Saberhagen, who unfortunately couldn't with us this afternoon, we have identified the ship which has been contaminating the reef and harming the marine life. The photo has been forwarded to the authorities and arrests have been made. (applause) (playful music) You are just the cutest little thing. You sure you don't wanna come? I'm sure. I think you've already got the two best guides on the reef. (cheerful music) (cheerful music)
