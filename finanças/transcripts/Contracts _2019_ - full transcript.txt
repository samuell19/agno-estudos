Just say the word, man. (PUNCHES THUDDING) (TENSE MUSIC) (FOOTSTEPS TAPPING) Isn't Cloak supposed to send somebody in today? - A chick? - Rebecca Fields. Mm, Becky. Meet Dick. (LAUGHS) Listen, I should tell you about Fields. Don't talk to her like you do other women. What are you babbling about? Just trust me. If you have any sense of self-preservation, just stay clear of her. (DOOR CLICKING) Is he awake? We're not sure. Well, I hope you enjoyed your cowboy shit because it's over. Excuse me. (FOOTSTEPS TAPPING) (MAN MOANING) (DOOR CREAKING) He's ready to talk. (FOOTSTEPS TAPPING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Yes. I'm on my way. (PHONE BUZZING) (PHONE CLICKING) (TENSE MUSIC) (FOOTSTEPS TAPPING) Anthony Lo. I'm Marc Sullivan. Why don't you come with me? (FOOTSTEPS TAPPING) I heard you're out of work. I'd like to offer you some. What's the catch? There is none. I'm sure you're aware of current events, what's been happening to our people. Our people? Killers, like you and me. Someone's hunting us, one by one. Why? (SIGHS) We don't know. Who they are, why they're after us, who hired them. No one knows. So that's the catch. What is? You want me to help you find out. (CHUCKLES) (FOOTSTEPS TAPPING) You took your sweet time getting here. Blake, she's here now. Scotton's dead, did you know that? My condolences. You bitch! Blake, calm down. How did he die? It was a sniper. Didn't he get away? LAZARDUS: No, he did not. The sniper was found dead nearby. Who killed the sniper? LAZARDUS: Whoever it was did us a favor. What are we gonna do about this? We're looking into the identity of the sniper. Hopefully, that will lead us to whoever hired them. In the meantime, everything will proceed as planned. Rebecca, you'll be taking over Scotton's place. Fields! This is bullshit. Thank you, sir. I'll get to work immediately. (FOOTSTEPS TAPPING) You must be pretty happy with your new promotion. REBECCA: Most people would. You know, I find it kinda funny that a guy you never liked is killed and you're the one who benefits. I guess Constantine figured your hands were pretty full being senator and all, so logically, I am the net best candidate. We are gonna find out who hired that sniper. (FOOTSTEPS TAPPING) (BODY THUDDING) I should kill you! (SIGHS) But you won't! You need my help to help you find who killed her. You need my help! Is that what this is? Was she helping you? Am I here to replace her? I promise you that is not it, okay? She was killed during an assignment just like the rest of us. We, we have to stop this together. (CHUCKLES) You're using me. I'm giving you a chance for revenge. If you go at it alone, he will kill you, I can guarantee that! Excuse me. (SIGHS) Why'd you feel it was necessary for you to come here? Because your man fucked up. My man took care of your target. And wound up dead for Cloak to find. Do you realize this is a problem for the both of us? I've lost three people. How exactly is this your problem? If they're able to trace it back to you, they get closer to me. They won't. I have another issue, another job. (SIGHS) What? Blake Morris, he's beginning to suspect me. No, that will only draw more suspicion. He's a problem to me alive! I gotta deal with this ghost that's been killing off my crew! Like you said, it's both our problems. I want Morris dead, today. It'll be double. And why's that? I'm putting two men on this assignment. You want it done right, no loose ends. You get nothing until the job is done, no loose ends. (SOMBER MUSIC) (METAL ZIPPING) I see you're the new guy, huh? ANTHONY: And you are? Headshot. Anthony. Anthony. I'm done hiding. (SIGHS) Fair enough. What do you know about this guy we're after? He's already killed three of us. No civilians? Only assassins. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Senator Blake Morris. Got to where he was today with help from Cloak. If you accept the money for taking a life, you're no doubt familiar with them. Constantine has chosen Morris as a golden boy with plans to put him in the Oval Office. When he's not busy making the world a better place, he spends time four year old son. Arch, his bodyguard. Morris moves with a tight crew. He prefers local mob types as he has a history with them. He'll be easy. (TENSE MUSIC) We have an insider with a constant watch on Morris and his whereabouts. Headshot'll take care of Morris. You'll be his backup. You're setting a trap? Damn right. All of our people were killed during assignment. He'll be there, so be ready. (CAR HUMMING) You knew Malice? Yeah. She was a good assassin. Let's focus on the task at hand. (DOOR CLANKING) (TENSE MUSIC) Let's get this over with. See you around. (GUN FIRING) (BODY THUDDING) Headshot, I've made contact.

All right, stay put, I'm coming over. (LOCK CLICKING) (TENSE MUSIC) (DOOR CLACKING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (PHONE BUZZING) What? ANTHONY: Morris got away. He was expecting us. There was no sign of our killer. He didn't show. I know. ANTHONY: How? You and Headshot meet me at the rendezvous point. No one else, just the two of you. No one followed you? Of course not. HEADSHOT: What's going on? Ballistic's dead. What? He wasn't on an assignment. He was at Fields's place. What was he doing at Fields's place? Keeping tabs. Keeping tabs. How do you know it's him? Who else would it be? Ballistic was one of the best. No one else could've caught him off guard. He knows our moves. What? He knew we were setting a trap. If Morris could figure it out, so could he. You think it's one of us? Sullivan, he's someone close. There's only us. What about your insider, with Cloak? He's my guy. It's not him. (SIGHING) Why is Morris still alive? Why didn't you? The job was simple! You drew too much suspicion to yourself! They were waiting for us! You're gonna blame this on me? The whole situation is fucked! Cloak is gonna come after me now! You owe me protection! (LAUGHS) No! We're in the same boat! You created this! Keep me alive or you get nothing, understand? Go to the safehouse, we'll talk. BLAKE: Sir, with all due respect, Fields has to go. She put a hit on me! How sure are you? Goddamit, it was her! We had a little chat this morning, a rather heated one. I expected someone to come for me tonight, and I was dead fucking right! Are you familiar with Marc Sullivan? No. He's one of the best assassins in the world. The sniper who killed Scotton is one of his proteges. If Rebecca is behind all this, there's no doubt she's working with Sullivan. Then we kill all of them. Rebecca will be dealt with. As for Sullivan and his team, we can buy them out. What? They'll be useful. They killed Scotton, they killed my men! Rebecca are responsible for all their deaths. These assassins are merely tools. Soon they'll be ours to use. Do not make this personal. Fields has to die! She will. Those assassins failed in eliminating you, so she'll most likely seek protection. We'll send the Reapers. (TENSE MUSIC) MARC: What do they know? Didn't take 'em long to link Malice to you. They also know that Fields is behind everything. (SIGHS) What's their plan? They're gonna kill Fields by midday. They figure you'd protect her, so they're sending the Reapers. I'd stay clear. There has been a development. What? (SIGHS) Constantine likes you. He wants you to work for him. Good. Yeah, Morris isn't too happy about that, you killing his men and all. (SIGHS) He wants you all dead, but Constantine is not gonna allow that. I'll give you the location where Fields is hiding. Let the Reapers have an easy one.

Mr. Constantine, it's a pleasure. You know what we do, and we know what you do. So, are we in agreement we should work together. Absolutely. I want there to be absolutely no animosity between us, any of us. Blake, shake his hand. This is a mistake, sir. Blake, shake his hand. The past is the past. Lest we forget. Good, from here on we move forward together. (DOOR CLACKING) I hear you've been having some trouble lately? We're being hunted. Yes, an assassin who's hunting other assassins. Well, we specialize in finding people. We'll help you with this problem. I appreciate that. (SOMBER MUSIC) You do the same thing ever night. What is it exactly that you're contemplating? You have no right to be here. It doesn't matter, I still could've killed you. (SIGHS) You think. Truthfully, I was half expecting to find you the same way I found Ballistic. If I can get in here undetected, so could he. But you don't really care about whether you live or die, do you? Are you my therapist now? Ah, well I know what drives you. We are on the same side. You keep trying to tell me we're on the same side, and we want the same thing. We're not the same. We kill people for a living. That's where our similarities end. MARC: Why do you do it? Why do you? There are bad people in this world. We need to get rid of them. What makes you think we're not bad people? We do what is necessary. Killing is a part of life, whether it's for food, survival, defending those we care about. We kill for the greater good. You think we're doing the world a favor? This partnership with Cloak is a blessing. Now we will have more power, and we'll use it for good. You can trade fields and feather to the wolves. You use people. Whatever it is you're planning, it's not as righteous as you say it is. I won't let you manipulate me into fighting your war. You can't deny that you have a stake in this either. The man who killed you ex-wife. Do it for her. Why do you want him dead? We are the true heroes of our time. He stands between us and our purpose, to bring peace into this world. After I kill him, you and I are done. What's this? Roland Burke. Ingram found him in Cloak's database. Think this is him? I know it's him! All right. MARC: We kill him tonight. (TENSE MUSIC) Do you know where our mark is? Burke, I can't believe it was him the whole time. I used to work with him. Do you have a problem with killing him? Of course not. (DOOR CLANKING) (FOOTSTEPS TAPPING) Sullivan told me about Malice. I'm sorry. Let's just find him and kill him. She didn't talk much about her past. I had no idea. You speak about your past? Only when the time is most appropriate. (VELCRO RUSTLING) Who is this? Burke. Who killed him? HEADSHOT: I don't know. Looks like Sullivan was wrong. Not hard to imagine. I'm sorry. Why are you sorry? HEADSHOT: I'm sorry about Malice. You didn't kill her. I truly am sorry about everyone, but it had to be done. I said I only talk about my past at the most appropriate time. This is the most appropriate. I was a victim of your kind. I learned what true evil was. Destroying lives for profit. You're monsters. You in particular I find interesting. You don't know why you're a monster. You just are! And now you have to die, just like everyone else. (GUN FIRING) (GUN CLACKING) (GRUNTING) I killed her with my bare hands! I always reveal myself before the end. Malice, Ballistic, I want them to feel betrayed, deceived! I want them to feel the pain and wrath of every victim they've ever claimed. (GUN FIRING) (GUN CLICKING) (HEAVY BREATHING) (TENSE MUSIC) (BLAKE CHATTERING DROWNED OUT BY MUSIC) Don't do anything stupid, Senator, although I know how hard that is for you. What do you want? Obviously not to kill you. I apologize for yesterday. I had to keep up appearances for Sullivan, but things have changed. Sullivan? Are you turning on him? They know who I am now. I require someone with similar goals. You want Sullivan and his whole crew dead, yes? Yeah, but that's not up to me, Constantine... Constantine will do nothing! He's too smart. You're a ticket to the ultimate power. A slap on the wrist is the most you'll ever get. It's much more important than this group of assassins. What do you get out of it? Their extinction. I need your help to make that happen. (SIGHS) I'm gonna have to think about this. I wanna hear from you in the morning. And remember, don't do anything stupid. It only takes one second for someone to die. (EERIE TINKLING MUSIC) I killed her with my bare hands! (SCREAMING) (GASPING) (SIGHS) (GROANS) Thank you. For what, saving your life? Yeah. You're welcome. I know this place. The Tell Building. One of the perks of being partners with Cloak. Stop dreaming, Sullivan. We're not partners. They own us. And we own this place! Things change. What now? (SIGHS) The plan hasn't changed. Everything's changed! I can't trust your judgment anymore, not after everything that's happened. All the people who've died on your watch. They were my people. Hands off the boss, Mr. Lo. (SIGHING) We've been tracking Headshot. You've been wrong before. He had all of us fooled, but now we got him cornered. He's more dangerous than you think. MARC: Will that stop you? I'm being realistic. We're gonna need more people. All of our people are dead. It gets worse. (TENSE MUSIC) Well well. What's this mean? It means we're outnumbered. And outgunned. Morris lives in a protective bubble. With Headshot joining him in there, we're not gonna be able to reach him. Not to mention all the manpower Morris has access to. Including the Reapers. (CHAIR CLATTERING) I thought we were all supposed to be cool now. Won't take much convincing for Morris to come after us. So now we're fucked? Follow me. (RAIN SPLATTERING) (LOCK CLICKING) (FABRIC RUSTLING) (HEAVY BREATHING) What do you want? I want to see if your training's paid off. What are you talking about? I need you out in the field with me. We found the killer. We're all killers, Sullivan. That's right, and we're going to do what is necessary. Enough of your bullshit, Sullivan! We are not superheroes! You can walk off this anytime you like. You'd be rotting in a shit-infested alley if it wasn't for me. You challenge my views, but you're following my path. So, if you want to quit, then quit! (SIGHS) How old are you? No younger than we were when we first started. We can't risk his life. I can take care of myself. And who are you anyway? He's here to help. And you? Brett has proven to be quite the prodigy. He will be useful. He's too eager to take a life. That's what I do best. And that's why you do it? Isn't that why you do it? That's why you're here, right, to help? Because helping Sullivan means a lot of people are gonna die. Enough. Let's get to work. (SOMBER MUSIC) (SIGHING) You're just a kid who thinks he's angry. You wanna know who I am? I'll show you. As for you and Headshot, I don't know who's worse. Be thankful you're not the one I'm after.

BRETT: Sullivan already told me. Were you supposed to save her? ANTHONY: I was supposed to kill her. Now, I have only one thought. He took her from me. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Do not underestimate them! They'll go through your clients' men as easy as last time. You need astounding numbers. Spread the word. I want every hitman, ex-military, ex-con, every thug lowlife piece of shit. Even every psychopath, anyone willing to walk into a bloodbath. You got that? (GUN CLICKING) They will be angry, driven by twisted morality. Tonight, they all die. The money's up front. MAN: I was KGB. - Cartel. - Triad organization. show me who to kill. (HEART BEATING) (FIST THUDDING) MARC: It's time. On the other side, a more peaceful world awaits. (TENSE ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Shit. This is what we prepared for. You're crazy, they're sending everyone. Then everyone's gonna die. (GUN CLICKING) (ELEVATOR DOOR CREAKING) (GRUNTING) (GUNS FIRING) (GRUNTING) What is this, a kid?

(GRUNTING) Where is he? (GUN FIRING) What were you thinking, going against Constantine's orders? You, of all people, should know the repercussions. My son, he was gonna kill my son! Yes, your son. After I kill you, he'll have to go, too. You stupid fuck! If I die, Constantine'll wipe all the rest of you off this fucking planet. Not likely. The senator who never wanted to move up to presidency, dragging Cloak's plans for years and years. You're Plan A. Plan A's dead. Cloak is moving in a bright new direction. Constantine's getting too old and tired for all this. He needs us, me, to take Cloak to a bright new age. Us getting rid of you is just everything going according to plan. You're full of shit! You're gonna end up just like Fields. Hm, yes, Fields. What you don't realize, Senator, is that it was all part of the plan. Fuck you. (GUN FIRING) (METAL CLANKING) (SOMBER MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) BRETT: Hey. (HEAVY BREATHING) I'm going alone. Sure, you are. If you come with me, you'll die. If I don't go with you, you'll die. (SIGHS) Look, I'm not doing this for Sullivan. My whole family was killed in front of me. I never found the men responsible. I don't know if I ever will. Until then, everyone is responsible. Everyone pays. You people believe what you're doing is good, but you're severely wrong. You're puppets! But you all try to justify yourself! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) You kill to satisfy your bloodlust. You kill because you love to. You're right. I'm unarmed. Kill me, if you can.

Unknown why you're pleased with this news. You will, in time. So, what else is there. Unfinished business. With who? MARC: The Morris family. (GUN CLINKING) One last thing. That night Ballistic was killed, same night Headshot and I were supposed to take out Morris. Headshot was with me the whole time. He didn't kill Ballistic, he couldn't have. Even I thought it was strange at the time, how Marc Sullivan was being outdone by just one man. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (INTENSE MUSIC) (GENTLE, SOMBER MUSIC) (TENSE ELECTRONIC MUSIC)
