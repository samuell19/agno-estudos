To let his parents throw theengagement party at their lodge. You know what elseHallie, don't be silly. We already decidedwe're having it here. Mom, it's really the leastyou can let them do. I mean, you and Dad are doingeverything for the wedding. Why can't we let them do this? You want an engagement partyin the snow Wfor a summer-themed wedding?? Tell me howthat makes any sense. So what if it'san engagement party in the snow for a summer-themed wedding?Who really cares? Everyone we know will. And besides, I already ordered these adorable place settingswith real starfish and some monogramedcocktail umbrellas. these adorable place settingsOh, Mom, that sounds great abut I really thinkit's more important that we allow Lucas' parentsto be involved somehow. Hallie, what do you thinkyour Aunt Belinda will say? Drinking piña coladasin her fur coat. HalWell, you know what,nkyour Aunt Belinda needssay? to get with the timesand get rid of her fur coats. Animal cruelty, anyone? Besides, I'm not even sureI want her there. Can I have just a nice littleengagement party, just us? Mom, I think if you sawhow cute their place is and gave it a chance,you'd see how nice it would be Mom, I tto have you sawthe engagement party there. Hallie, is this what you want or is it what Lucas wants? It's what we want. -Okay?-Fine. Personally, I thinkyou're making a mistake but if that's what you want we will have yourengagement party in the snow but I'm bringingthe starfish place settings. [knock at door] Come in. -Morning.[-Good morning. So, I talked to my mom and we can have the engagementparty at your parents' place. -Really?-Mm-hmm. Well, that's good news. About time your momfinally signed off. Kidding. Thank youfor doing the dirty work. Oh, you aren't to thank me. It's the right thingfor us to do. So how many peopleshould we plan for? Well, I told my momthat we wanna keep it small So how many peopleso just like closest family. I love that idea,almost as much as I love you. Well, anyway,my mom will have her hands full helping us plan the wedding,so she doesn't need Well, anyway,myanything extra on her plate.l Yeah, does your mom really everrun out of room on her plate? I kinda feel like she has oneof those big family plates that she keeps wanting peopleto eat from. As long as this is whereit ends, and she doesn't try to dish out our entire futureon to it I think we can survive this. Well, don't be too sure. I'm pretty sureshe'd plan out our entire children's future if we let her. Okay, let's get some breakfast. children'Buffet style.e let her. So an engagement partyin the snow and then a summer weddingin Cabo? I know. It sounds kinda weird,huh? I don't know, it just kindasounds like you're doing this one thing for his parents I dand then another thingdasounds likfor yoursdoing this but... what doyou and Lucas want? Quinn, you knowI want to get married in Cabo as much as my mom wants me to. It's been my dream since shetook me there for my sweet 16. Okay, but is itwhat Lucas wants? Lucas loves the idea. We'vetalked about it a ton of times. Okay, but is it the only optionyou've discussed? I mean, a winter weddingin the snow could be cool. Hey, no. Lucas' momalready offered that. And it doesn't make sense to gochanging everything on a whim. It's all been decided and... I really don't wanna ruffleany more feathers. Oh, okay,now what I'm hearing is you're just doing all thisto keep the peace. Okay, Gina, Mara... Hallie here needs a little helpexpanding her horizons. Summer weddingversus winter wedding. And go. Summer wedding,people have time off work and they're not worried aboutpaying for a destination wedding after overspendingpeoplon the holidays.work Winter wedding, your guestswon't sweat their faces off. Ooh, winter wedding,white winter doves on demand. Win-And snowflake cakes.stswon't -Summer wedding.s off. Beachside bathing suits,summer fun in the sun. Aye! Beachside bathing suits,Okay, I get it. Both have perks. And, yes, the idea of a winterwedding in the snow is cute. It's just not part of our plan, which has always beena summer wedding in Mexico. Except for the engagement party,that part's in the snow. So what? Why can't we havethe best of both worlds? Except for the engagement party,You can if you're being greedy. So how about you just pick one?And I'll take the other. [all laughing] Hey, you guysare not amusing me today. A-are you supposedto be putting that much color? It's fine. Trust me,I know what I'm doing. Except when it comesto your wedding, apparently. [Hallie]Oh, don't forgetwho writes your checks. Weddings aren'tabout the bride and the groom and what they want, So, if we do it this way Wthey're abouttabweveryone will be happy..om Fine. Self-sacrificeall you want but speak for yourself, becausewhen it comes to my wedding it's going to be all about me. Hallie, hi. How are you? Barbara, hi.What are you doing here? Your mother sent me overwith some dress options because we want you to pick out your picture-perfectwedding gown but she didn't really give meany details so I just broughta little of everything.

And... I don't even likethe San Sanchez. I know. It's too bad thatwe didn't know all this before. We could have justgotten married here. That isn't such a bad idea,actually. Huh? That isn't such a bad idea,Maybe we could get married here. Maybe that's whatwas meant to be all along. Hallie, you're joking, right? Look at the signs, Lucas. Honestly, I'd rather do it herethan down there at someplace we don't even like. Honestly, I'd rather do it hereBabe, I was just joking.

And this placewill never be the same But we want everyoneunless we do it now. Plus, what better placeto tie the knot than wherewe first fell in love? What about that summer weddingyou and your mom always dreamed of? Maybe thisis the next best thing. And your mom? I can't imagine that she's gonnabe onboard with this. Well, she can't have ither way now, regardless. And she has to respect the factthat we don't wanna wait Just let metry and reason with her. Brave girl. Are you absolutely surethis is what you want? Lucas, it doesn't matterwhere we get married. All that matters here is us. Well, I guess we havea winter wedding to plan. -Am I too overdressed for this?-Oh, no. -We're all just underdressed.-You're good, Deidre. [Deidre]Well, it is an engagement party.

You know the San Amoresis the only place that we wantedto have the wedding but if we can't have itwhere you and Dad did we don't feel there'sany better place than this one. Okay, then why don't youwhejust wait a yearid and we can still dothe San Amores. I already put us on the listin case you wanted to wait. Well, that's just the thing,Mom, we don't wanna wait.

Oh, but I'll still need you tocome downtown with me tomorrow to help pick out decorations. Hm. I'd like to help too. We're gonna do a co-edbachelor party or anything? Seven Card Stud again?

Because everybody'sout there waiting and I'm supposed to be gettingmarried in, like, 15 minutes. Hallie, all I'm saying and is that you and Lucasttingmahaven't tied the knot yet.. And this news just didn't comeout of nowhere for no reason so you do still have a choice. You did say that you wishedyou could wait the other night. I don't know what I want anymore but it reallydoesn't matter now. -Yes, it does!-No, Mom. I am not gonna do that to Lucas. -Yes, it does!-I won't. Then you won't have to.

What, for the boutonnièreor for marriage? Leif... Come on, up. So did you finish your speech? I wrote two. I'm not surewhich one I wanna use yet. So dWhy did you pick two?eech? I wrote onethat's really heartfelt and then I wrote another one that's really funny,and a little embarrassing. And I'm not surewhich one I wanna use. -Heartfelt, please.-I concur. This is not the day to embarrassyour big brother, okay? -Heartf-Fine.lease.-I-Hey.ur. You boys just about ready? Dad's out there,calming the masses. Yeah, yeah, yeah, just about.How-how's she doing?

'Cause she reallywasn't acting like that. Mom, spill it. Okay, so Barbara saidthat she could now get Cabo San Amoreson June 15th, okay? And? -What did Hallie say, Mom?-She said no. No, she wants to do it here.And that's that, okay? That's kinda not what I heardthe other night. And what did you hear? [exhales sharply] Lucas, wait. Lucas, what are you doing?You can't see Hallie. -It's bad luck.-Hallie, look at me. Do you really wannaget married today or no? What? Of course, I do.Why would you even ask me that? Well, Leif saidhe overheard you telling Quinn that you wish you were gettingmarried in Cabo, and you were just doing thisfor me. -Is that true?-Of course it is. Look at her, she's been a mess over this whole thingthe entire weekend. over this whole thingWell, have them wait. Can you all just give usa minute alone, please? [sighs] Can you all just give usI can't believe you lied to me. Lucas, that is not what I said. I only said that I wish we werestill getting married in Mexico, but then I didn'twant to wait another year. That's not what you saidthe other day, you said "All that matters now is us." Yes, and that was the truth. And now that you can getyour Cabo wedding back, your dream wedding,is it still the truth? Lucas, it was a silly, selfishmoment that I was having, but I didn't wannabother you with it. We already had enoughon our plate. Hallie, if you're feeling thisway, you have to tell me. We Okay, sometimesughit's okay to be selfish when something's that important. You should never justdo something for me to appease me when you knowyour heart's not in it. You're just gonna end upresenting me in the end. I just found out that Cabowas may be still an option like ten minutes ago. And I didn't just suggest thisto appease you, I, I really thoughtthat this was the only solid option we had. Okay, okay, but I just don'twant you to settle for something 'cause you thinkit's the only option we have. We should both be happywith this decision. That's what marriage is. I know. I just... I thought it was too late, and Ididn't want to hurt anyone else by changing our minds yet again. But, Hallie,by you not telling me, you could havemade things worse. What if you walk down that aisle you could havepretending everything's okay and then right in that moment I saw something was wrong? And suddenly on the mostimportant day of our lives... you're wishing you weresomewhere else? And suddenly on the mostAnd I'm standing there wondering why the love of my life might behaving second thoughts? And suddenly on the mostAnd I'm stan[sighs]ere wondering [sniffles] You're right. I should've told you. I should've communicatedwith you. I should've knownthat you're not like my mother and that you would'veunderstood. I'm so sorry, Lucas. Look, Hallie... I want to get married to you more than anythingin the world... I wanbut not like this.o you Not when we're not a 100% surethis is what we want. This isn't us. [sighs] [exhales] Maybe we should postpone. Till we really figure outwhat we want to do for our wedding day. Till we really figure outwhat[exhales]to do -This is gonna be fabulous.-I know. Oh, son, we were justtalking about you. -This is Gina and Mara.-Hi. They work with Hallieat the salon. -You must be Leif. Hello.-Ooh. It's a pleasure to meetaboth of you. Dad, can I talk to youfor a minute? It's a pleasure to meetaboOutside?u. Sure. Uh, would you excuse usfor just a second. -Mm-hmm. Yeah.-Okay. Sure. UhUh, excuse me,cuse usladies and gentlemen. Hello. Uh, unfortunately due tothe inclement weather, uh, we are going to postpone today's festivities. Um, feel free to grab a gift bag on your way out and, uh,thank you all for, for coming. Why did you tell himwhat you heard? You don't even knowwhat you heard. I already had to hear itfrom my mom and dad. I really don't need to hear itfrom you too. I just, I didn't wanteither of them to regret their wedding day. You do realize that youalmost ruined their wedding day. That's not fair. I love Hallie. I just wantwhat's best for both of them. You know, this is exactly why I don't date guys like you. Oh. And what kind of guyis that? Guys like you knowwhy how to walk into a roomyou. Ohand light it up withuytheir childish, charming humor. But then they take off Ohanjust the secondithuytheir cthat it gets real humor. and pursue to thisnext big adventure. It's probably why you're stillbartending instead of doing something importantnewith your life.e. You're just a selfish kidwith no regrets. I never said that I hadno regrets about today. l And for the record, the onlyreason I'm still bartending is because I'm payingto go to school. I'm gonna be a dentist. See? Nah, shouldn't have figuredI'm gonyou would.ntist. [knock at door] Come in. -Hallie---Mom... I have something to say,and I need you to listen. You have to stop interferingwith my life, especially when it comes to mineand Lucas' marriage. I know I've said and donesome things that, that have caused problemsfor you and Lucas, but-- Yeah, you have. thatAnd at some pointlemsfoyou have to realizet-- that I'm a mature,responsible adult who is capable of makinggood decisions that I'm a mature,without your consultation. whoAnd if growing up,ingif you would've given me even one second to figure out whoAnd if growing up,ingiwhat it is that I wante maybe I wouldn't have even hadevthese ideas to begin with.t whoAnd if growing up,ingiwhaI know.

[sighs] Honey, after watchingWhyyou and Lucashat? dancing last night... HoI now realize thatgnothing there could compare to what was happeningin that moment here. Or, or any of this, really. Hallie... I lied to you... when I told you that we gotmarried in Cabo San Amores.  -What?-Yeah. But Dad didn't-- Oh, your fathernever supported me filling your head with those silly ideas as a child. And then when you got older,and you had your heart set on getting married there too,I think he was just, he was just afraidof how you'd react if we said anything. Please, it... Don't be mad at him. I mean, it was,it was all my fault. But, wait, you, you and Dadhave that wedding photo on that beautiful beach. But, wait, you, you and DadOh, that was just, um... [chuckles]It was a pretty stretch of But, wait, you, you and DadOpublic beach in Oxnard. [chuckles]on a really cold Monday evening But, wait, you, you and Dadwith no one else around. It was just us and a preacher,that's it. I mean, we didn'teven tell our parents we were getting married. Why would you lie to meabout something like this? we werBecause I...rried. so wanted to get married there. You know, it was my dream,but, um... You know, your fatherdidn't want to ask his parents for moneyand-and my, my family couldn't afford it. I mean, we had justgraduated college, we, we didn't have jobs, we had student loansa mile high, but... but none of that mattered. I mean, much more than Mexico,I just... I just wanted to marryyour father. So we did. -Wow, Mom.-Yeah. And now, I seethat's all you want. I mean, you just want to getmarried to Lucas and, and start buildingyour life together I mean, you just want to getjust like we did. Honey, I... I put all the regretI had about... not having my dream weddingon to you and... I put all the regretI'm really sorry. You know what? It kinda sounds like you and Daddid have the perfect wedding. Yo[chuckles]t? It kinda sounds like you and Daddid have thWell...ct wedding. maybe you're right. [chuckles] The only day that couldmapossibly compare. was the day I gave birth to you. Ah. So... -How is Lucas?-Oh. [sniffles] --He's fine.s?-Okay. We are fine. Good. You know, that boymust love you a lot. [chuckles]To put up with someone like me. I will, uh...

So, did you and Hallie decidewhat you wanna do? No, just... Whole thing's such a mess... I really don't know what to do.

Oh, especiallyfor how I've acted since you and Halliehow I tregot engaged.d, uh... Thank you. I really appreciate that. Believe it or not, I, um... I have a great deal of respectfor you, Lucas. And, uh, if I'm beingperfectly honest, I hathere's really no onespectI trust more to be there for Hallie than you. Coming from you,that means a lot. Oh, and whateverthe two of you decide on your wedding,just know that I will be there in full support no matter what. And I'll just... I'll just be so proudthat my daughter is finally marryingthe man of her dreams. [chuckles] -Thank you.-Yeah. Go get your bride. Going somewhere? Yeah, just for a few hours. Rolling on another oneof my childish adventures. That was harsh. I may have been projectinglittle bit. And I'm sorry. Thank you. But, but what you said was... mostly true.
