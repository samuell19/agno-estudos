You. Holy shit. Who am I? [groaning] Jesus Christ. "Remember"? Remember, uh... Shit! Remember nothing. What is going on?! Fuck! Who am I?! Fuck! [distant door closes] [amnesiac] Hello? Hello? Hey, could--is anyone there? Can you help me? [loud bang] [panting] [sniffles] [bucket clatters] Oh. [groans] [chuckles] I'm going crazy, man. [boy] Well, we have 63 days. How do you expect me to survive without cell phone or Internet access? Get over it! Dang! We're young. It's summer camp. [amnesiac] Who's that? Adam Goldstein? [distant thump] OK, what do I know? I'm Adam. [sighs] What else do I know? What is going on? What's going on?! [flies buzzing] [woman] Do you have any idea what you're doing? I'm a United States citizen. Your actions here could turn a cold war into a nuclear fucking holocaust! You have absolutely no fucking idea what I'm saying, do you? [Russian accent] You are spy, right? So now you help Mother Russia. [woman screams] [speaks Russian] Um, OK. Wow, I'm Russian? Russia, Russia, Russia. I'm a Russian teenage scientist from the Cold War who doesn't age, apparently. Probably not. [sighs] [door creaks] [Adam] I like to come here and get away sometimes. You know, it's just-- it's quiet, peaceful. Wow. This place is amazing at night. Yeah, you know, it's-- it's cool to think here, let the stillness of the water relax you. -Like meditation? -Like meditation? [Adam] Yeah, like that. Like that. I'm--I'm really starting to feel something for you. Is that--is that weird, that I feel very connected? No. It's not bad at all. Ohh. Jess, I just don't want to hurt anyone. [Adam sighs] Right. Must be an asshole. Oh, Jesus, what happened to you? Looks like we're in this together. What do you say? My bad. There you go. Fuck. I hear you're still having those stupid, nasty seizures. Are they scary? How old are you? -I'm 7 3/4. -[gasps] You're older than my daughter. She's only 7 1/2. I'm going to go talk to your parents about a procedure I'd like to try. It's nothing bad. It's called multiple subpial transections, which is a lot of big words to describe very tiny cuts that you won't feel at all. [equipment beeping] Kayla, count backwards from ten for me. Clean here, please. -10... -[nurse] Yes, Doctor. [Kayla] 9, 8, 7... [doctor] Looks good. Thanks. Making a 5-millimeter incision. -[Kayla] 6... -[prolonged beep] No! No! [Kayla] W to the power of I... [nurse] We're losing a lot of blood. ...derivative over N to the power of I minus A Z to the power of... [prolonged beep] No. No, no. No! Shit. OK. [sniffs] [sighs] Uh... ...very special day, and frankly, I don't care to hear anymore about the sick need you have to update your Facebook status. -Special day? -Tyrannical reign of these little bastards is coming to an end. This is the time that the people at the bottom, we rise up and we take down the powers that be. And who are the powers that be? Spoiled little shit bags. We have no authority over these kids. They know that every disciplinary action we take is merely a suggestion because they make one little phone call to their rich little daddies, and all of a sudden, Little Billy doesn't have to make his own bed anymore. I got to make his own bed, with these hands. -So this is about Billy? -Fuck Billy! No! Well, yeah, but it's not just about Little Billy. It's about all the Little Billies. Stop calling them Little Billies. Fuck! What's his name, the kid who shit himself? Don't talk about Puraj. Yeah, Puraj, the Puerto Rican kid. He's Indian! [man] You're missing my point. What's your point? We're gonna butt-fuck these kids. Wow. [Jess] Who are you butt-fucking? No one, Jess. It's all good. Mm-hmm. You look really sweet. Good. I love her. I can't believe she's my fucking girlfriend. It's forever. Yeah, well, it's just a water fight, so...calm down. Butt fuck! [Adam's friend on P.A.] Good morning, campers. I hope you have your running shoes on today, 'cause I'm fucking coming for you, you little shits! Yeah, see? There he his. You're finally living a little, instead of that emo, brooding bullshit. You want to jerk each other off? -What? -Just touch it. What the fuck? Get outta here. [Adam] Aah! Aah! [kids yelling] Yeah, I'm your worst nightmare! [Adam] Clark, Clark. -Oh, my God. -Clark, dude. You're the big dog. Ha ha! OK, uh, look, there's something I have to tell you, Clark. [Clark] Little Billy. I want him dead. [both grunt] [laughs and groans] Ha ha! -Ohh. -Oh, my God. [Adam] You OK? Yeah, I think. Oh. Yeah, I...I think so. Remember? Goddamn it, I can't remember. Shit! Think, Adam! Which one of you fucking retards was screaming "Syria" and beaning kids with water balloons? Well, I guess that would be both of us. Well, not really. Both of us were throwing water balloons, to be honest, but, you know, it was for fun. [Adam] Yeah, but we were throwing water balloons, but one of us was yelling "Syria"; "Run, you little faggots"; "Your rich parents can't save you." That was one of us. [Clark] It got out of hand out there, man. What's your excuse? All right, OK, OK. Jesus Christ. You know what? Get the fuck out of here. And take that fucking shirt off. It's disturbing. I'm gonna have nightmares. [Clark] It's not play time, it's nap time. Adam. No, just stay there. I'm gonna manage everybody on my own. Keep drawing. Do what you do. [Clark] What's this idiot doing? He's creeping me out. I'm gonna tell you guys a little story, and it doesn't end well for you, you little bumblebee. What's up, Puraj? You OK? Missing home? No. They picking on you again? Aw, come on, man. OK, look, believe it or not, I wasn't always this cool. Kids used to mess with me all the time. But, uh, you don't care about that. You just want to get 'em back, right? Eww! What was that?! Shut up and go to sleep. Something wet keeps on hitting me! Hey, kid, shut the fuck up and go to sleep before I start taking privileges. Hey, uh, excuse me. Is--is she OK? You mean Katie? -Yeah. -Yeah, she's great, except for the big-ass dent that you put in her forehead and the 4 stitches. -Four stitches? -Mm-hmm. Shit. Well, can I apologize to her or something? You can try, but if you'd just split my head open, I'd bust you on your ass. OK. [chalk scrawling] You scared the shh out of me. Shh out of you? What are you doing lurking over me like that? Are you crazy? I'm sorry. Look, I... I made you something. It's you with your head split open and your brains falling out. Oh, look, please go. I really don't feel like talking. [Adam] I'm trying to apologize. No, you're not. You just feel bad because you were acting like a moron and somebody got hurt. Sorry if your stupid doodles don't exactly lift y spirits. Stupid? Whatever. I tried. OK. [sighs] Try not busting anyone's head open on your way out. Douche bag. Oh, so you won't say "shit," but you'll say "douche bag"? Fine. Whatever. Forget about it. I'm not sorry, Katie. Fuck you. [nurse] Abandon hope! We're going down! Ha ha ha! Fuck you, too! Yeah, yeah. Fuck you! God-- Uh-huh, and that's what you get! Ha ha ha ha! [sighs] Mm-hmm. Rad. [chalk scrawling] Your douche-bag friend dropped this off for ya. Thank you. [scoffs] What are you doing? I look terrible. I've seen worse. Well, can I see it, at least? No. What, it isn't another apology doodle? No, you got yours. This is, uh... This is another one. This is just for me. You like it? Yeah, I do. I actually really do. I think I can do better. Yeah, I'll start right now with that beautiful onesie. -[chuckles] -Yeah, thanks. I know it. Ha! You know, earlier, before I twisted my ankle, when I said "Fuck you" and some other things? I apologize for that. Thanks. I really do. [grunts] OK, ready? There we go. I felt it. I felt the care, the love. -I don't usually-- -I don't like swearing. I don't usually say fuck, you know. See, now, that mildly offends me. That I just said that I-- Mildly or, like, actually? -Mildly, mildly. -OK. Fuck. Ha! Actually, uh, I made something for you, and we can talk to each other. [deep voice] Hey, my name's Adam, and I'm really angry all the time. [both laugh] [hums] Is that her? Yeah. "Hey, you! I'll bust your ass." -Ha ha ha ha! -"I'll bust--mm-hmm. Mm-hmm"--oh, shit. Dizzy-ass white kids. Yeah, I'll bust your ass. Sorry. I really do respect you. [Katie giggling] "Dizzy-ass white kids." Ha ha! How's your, uh, your wound? Oh, it's--it doesn't hurt anymore. Here, can you see anything? They wanted to, like, shave my head, but I said no. I can't--no. You look-- -Then yes, I'm fine. -You look healthy. -Thank you. -You're welcome. [chalk scrawling] [Adam] Katie? Katie. -Ohh! -[laughing] What the fuck?! Oh, my God! What is wrong with you? Are you kidding me? -Ha! -Jesus! -Oh, my God. -That's insane. -The look on your face. -No, it's real funny. Real funny. What's wrong? I was just kidding. I know, I--I thought something might have happened to you. I don't know. Like what? Why-- why would that matter? [sighs] When I was a kid, I...got lost in the woods. I got turned around in the forest a couple blocks from my house. You know, I was out there for a couple days. Oh. What'd you do? Found a log and I crawled inside. I don't know. I was alone. [laughing] [scoffs] What the hell? -Sorry, I'm sorry. -That's hilarious to you. -Wow, OK. -It's horrible. I'm sorry. I laugh at really inappropriate times. No. "Inappropriate"? This is beyond inappropriate. I'm baring my soul to you. I'm emotionally traumatized. Oh, no, I can't be in a room alone. I have this phobia, and it's funny to you. No, I'm sor--I'm-- I'm good. I'm sorry. -Done laughing at me? -Sorry. Yeah. -And my pain? -Yeah, I'm good. You know, you're messed up. Yeah. You know the really messed-up thing? My ankle's totally fine. Are you tired? Um, no. Not really. Why? Uh...what do you say we, you know, sneak out of here? There's a staff meeting tonight. No one's here. [Adam] Like to come here by myself and relax sometimes, you know. It's peaceful, quiet. OK, I, uh, I thought you had a phobia of being alone. I--I mean, yeah, but I like to come here and think, you know, and let the stillness of the water relax me. [snickers] -What? -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You--you know this is basically the camp toilet, right? What the hell! Why are you laughing? I'm trying to tell you-- Adam, stop. This is ridiculous. What? I'm being serious. I'm trying to tell you that I feel very connected-- Adam. [sighs] OK... this is all very cute, but, um, seriously, are you kidding? [scoffs] Adam, you are not capable of a serious relationship, and I came here to make out with you and then to go to bed. W-what? No. Katie, I want to be in a relationship, OK? I want to fall in love. So girls have this tendency to gossip. It's kind of our thing. Everyone knows this is your little sex den. My little sex den? -Yep. -Wow. You know... my grandfather had Alzheimer's, and every day, my grandma used to change the date on his newspaper just so he wouldn't, like, lose his mind. That's love. It's this false reality you share with someone. That's how I feel about you, Katie. [scoffs] No, it isn't. [Katie] What you're feeling is just a rush of 19-year-old-boy testosterone with the intense desire to jam your penis in me and, you know, that's fine, too, but... -[scoffs] -it's not love. [Adam] This is what I love about you. Don't even use the word "love" with me. It would be such a gross misuse of the term that, as a woman, I'm actually kind of offended. [Adam] But I don't mean to offend you. I just-- [Katie] Look, Adam, OK, I'm gonna make a rule. You can't say those words to anyone until you actually mean them, OK? Like, really mean them. Like, feel it in your gut, can't keep it in or it might just burst out of you kind of feeling. Until then, just don't, OK? -Do you promise? -Yeah, yeah, I promise. Fuck! Katie, Jesus. Also, you shouldn't swear so much. It makes you sound kind of stupid. [scoffs] Can we make out now? Yeah, yeah, I guess so. I mean... [jet engine roaring] [explosion] Fuck! Forestry Station 14, this is Camp Yellowjacket. Over. Forestry Station 14, this is Camp Yellowjacket. Over. Forestry Station 14, this is Camp Yellowjacket. Is anyone there, please? Over. [overlapping radio chatter] [man on radio] Camp Yellowjacket, this is Station 14. That you, Kevin? Over. Uh, no, Frank. It's Adam. Over. Uh, were you outside a couple minutes ago? Did you see anything fall from the sky? Over. You're breaking up, Yellowjackets. Can you repeat that? Over. Uh, the, uh, counselors got all the kids settled in their bunks. I don't think they're gonna go to sleep anytime soon, but...at least they're corralled, so... This is some crazy shit! A plane, a plane crashed just outside camp. Over. Don't touch anything. Did you see where it hit? Over. Uh, near--near Skyview Ridge, I think. One or two miles south of us. -Over. -All right, Yellowjacket. We're gonna send up some rangers to investigate the possible crash site. Just stay put, take care of the kids. We don't want anybody getting hurt. Over and out. Uh, y-yes, sir, we'll stay here. Over. We're gonna go up there, aren't we? I don't see how anyone could have survived that. [Clark] Holy shit. I--I'm staying here. [Clark] What the fuck happened? [Katie] Jesus Christ. Holy shit, man! [Adam] This is fucking nuts. What's that smell, man? I shouldn't be breathing this. It stinks. Guys? Guys! We need to leave. [gasps] Holy fuck! [man groaning] [whimpers] What do you think's in there? I don't know, man. It could be secret documents proving God knows what. Could be CIA, NSA. [Katie] Clark, let's just go. No, no, no, we can't just leave this here for some random people to stumble by and grab it. [growling] [Clark] We'll take it back to camp... No, Clark, we need to leave. [Clark] ...collect a reward. -Seriously shut up. -Hey, guys! Hey, guys! No, no, no, no. Look, look. Listen, it's almost open. I'll just open it, and if it's documents, we'll just leave it. Don't touch the case. No, Clark! Ugh! What the-- [Adam] Shit. [Katie] Adam, don't touch it. Aah! [Clark] Fuck! Oh! Get off of me! What the hell is wrong with him? [vomits] -Jesus Christ! -Shit! [hissing and growling] [bones crack] [Clark] What the fuck is wrong with him? What's up with his eyes? No, no, no, no. -[Katie] Clark! Clark! -Aah! -Get off me, man! -What the fuck! [Adam] Get off my friend! -Come on! -Get in the fucking truck! [Adam] Run! Run! Run! -Get up there! -Hurry, hurry, hurry! Let's go! Come on! Let's go! Shit! Whoa! -You OK? -Yeah, man! Clark, get the fuck out of here! What was that? What was that guy? [shouting indistinctly] [crash] [Adam screams] Aah! I'm fine. No, I'm fine, I'm fine, totally normal. This happens, this happens at camp. Aah! [man speaking Russian] [person breathing heavily] How are you feeling? Miss? How are you feeling? [Subject 14 speaking Russian] [grunts] I'm fine. It's all up in my head. It's all a dream. Just a... Ha ha ha ha! I'm talking to a fucking dead girl. Guy in a camp has stupid fucking memories that make no sense. Stupid memories! They make no sense. No sense! Hey, Hon. How was surgery? Hon, surgery? W to the power of I equals N to the power of I. Derivative over N to the power of I equals K to the power of I. Derivative over N to the power of I equals K to the power of I. [Kayla] Derivative over N to the power of I minus A Z to the power of... [Adam] Jess, are you good at math? Jess? Any idea what that means? Jess, I don't know. -I do. -Yeah-- [Jess] What's the big deal? It's camp. Why is everyone so serious around here? Look, I know. It's just... Maybe I should go. No, no, look, I know it's not a big deal. It's not. I just don't want to hurt anyone, you know? I... Fine. Just keep it between us, OK? Ho! Oh! What the fuck?! I just felt my dick in me! I-- Jess, I felt my dick... fuck me--I just fucked myself! What the fuck. I'm losing my mind. Jess, we shouldn't have gone up there. It was so stupid. You look better. God damn, I must be going crazy. But, you know, it could be worse. Could be alone... right? Katie? Katie! [Clark] Shhhhhh. [Adam] What? What is it? [Adam] Holy shit. We can't go out there, man. -Clark, what the fuck? -We can't help her. What are you talking about, man? [Clark] Shut up! You've been out, man. You've been passed out. You don't understand the gravity of the situation. I'm trying to help you. What are you talking about? He's still out there. That psycho guy from the plane. You know? [Clark] That fucking thing that attacked us. [Clark] He, like, leaned over Jess and he vomited some kind of black shit in her face. He's still fucking out there. [Adam] Clark, we can't just leave her out there. she's fucking alive. Shut the fuck up. Help. Help me. Look at her, man, it's Jess! He's waiting for us. Let me out of the car, Clark! [Clark] It's a trap, Adam, it's a trap. Get off me, man! Oh, my God. [Clark] I warned you! I tried to warn you. -[Katie] What was that? -It's just an animal. Come on. -[Katie] Adam. -[Adam] Katie, come on. I warned you, I tried to warn you. [Adam] Jess. Jess. Jesus, get up. [Jess groaning] [indistinct chatter] Oh, no, no, no, no. Clark, just drive. Katie, shut the door. [door closes] [engine sputtering] Come on, motherfucker. [Adam] Drive, god dammit. Clark, go! [engine sputtering] Come on, god dammit. Hey, we got to walk. What? [indistinct chatter] [Adam] Clark, just get the door. Help! Somebody help us! [Clark] We need help! [Jess groaning] [vomiting] Shhh. [Clark] What do we do? [girl screaming] [girl] Help me. Help me, please. [Jess vomiting] What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck did I do? [Katie] Clark, help me. [Adam] Clark, help me out. [Clark] What do you want me to do? -[Adam] What the fuck? -[Katie] Clark, help. [Jess coughing] What do we do? What do we do? [Katie] I don't know. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Adam! Jess! [roar] We can see it all. [deeper voice] We can see everything. Jess... baby? We're gonna get you help, OK? You don't need to help us. Us? Clark, come closer. Dude. [Jess] Come closer. Closer. [roar] -[Adam] Aah! -[Katie] Adam. Here. What the hell is going on! He's stabbed. Phone don't work. Goddamnit. [Yuri] Hello again, Subject 14. How are you feeling today? [speaking Russian] [Yuri] It's back to we again. [Yuri] Anyway, this strain is unusable and it's piece of shit. [Yuri] Yes, Subject 14? [Yuri] That's quite impossible. Your question is irrelevant. Subject 3 has broken free. We are freeing Subject 8 and 9 as we speak. We will be inside this room in 30 seconds. That's not going to stop us. We'll still get in. Isn't this what you wanted, Yuri? Isn't this easier? The time is coming. You'll need to decide. It's a simple choice. You should have known, Yuri. We were never going to be controlled. Shooting this body will not change the outcome. We will be in this room in 10 seconds. [Yuri] To the mask. Get the mask! [screaming] What the fuck? [exhales] [gasping] Here. Let me help you. [sniffles] [Katie] What are you doing? OK, this might hurt. -Ready? -Yeah. -[winces] -Sorry. Haa! Heh. How does that feel? It hurts. [chuckles] Here. So, what's the plan, guys? Um, OK, well, I guess we gotta go get the van, and start moving kids out. That's one option, yeah, sure. -[Adam] Clark. -I might've thought of a different idea, that's all. We're not leaving them here. Look, I'm just saying I have another plan. That's not fucking fair, Katie. You don't know what my plan is. Katie, come on. Clark, what's your plan? I'm just saying I don't even think that you guys are going to even consider my plan now -based on Katie's reaction. -Are you being serious? -What's your plan? -It's simple. We're in deep shit here. What's the plan, Clark? -Fuck the kids. -What? Daddy ain't gonna buy you out of this jam. -Clark. -Seriously. Fuck 'em. [Adam] We can't say fuck 'em. OK? They're a bunch of kids. -We're the only ones in town. -I can. I said fuck 'em. I'll say it again. Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em! It's out of the question. I'm not doing that. I told you you weren't gonna go for my plan. [Adam] There are 150 kids here under the age of 13 years old. You want us to just leave them out there -to fend for themselves? -This is bullshit. Clark, come on. [Clark] You're not seeing it, man. It's Lord of the fucking Flies here. There are no adults. We are the adults! What are you saying? Is that-- Is that supposed to help? Oh, God. I give up. I'm done. Good game. We just tied my vomiting girlfriend to a fucking chair so she would stop throwing up some kind of tar shit on us. Wake up, man! God damn, is it 1,000 degrees in here? Clark. [exhaling, coughing] I'm sorry about him. What? I'm sorry. It's really not funny. Let's get out of here, OK? -[Katie] Yeah. -[Adam] Keep it together. We need to get these kids. OK? Ahh. [gasping] We're all very excited to see how it turns out this time. What do you mean "we"? Ahh. You'll know soon enough. Look, Clark. Look at me, dude. [Adam] We're out of here. Are you coming with us? [chuckles, sighs] Just shut up. [laughs] What is so fucking funny? You're all so predictable. [Adam] Clark, seriously? Whatever the fuck that means. [Adam] OK, we're out of here. OK, Clark? We left you the broom. She loves the broom. [indistinct noise] Let's get out of here. You can untie us. We won't attack you again. [Jess] There's no need to now. Not a chance. Oh. We bet there is. [gasping] We're already inside your head. [Jess] There's nothing you can do about it now. Don't be the monkey that refuses to walk upright. I'm not listening to you. [Jess] Yes. You are. You're listening because you care. Your emotions make you weak. Riverrun PD, this is Adam Goldstein for Camp Yellowjacket, Is anyone there? Over. [static] Riverrun PD, there's an emergency. Someone please pick up. Over. [Clark] Baby, look at me. What's wrong with you? Why are you talking like this? [gasping] We're going to tell you something and you're going to get upset. Upset? Why would I be upset? It's silly, actually. Nothing worth being mad about. Despite that you'll smash that broomstick and leave yourself defenseless. What a stupid thing to do. But you will. And after, you'll realize you shouldn't be allowed to make your own decisions. Riverrun PD, there's an emergency. Is anyone there? Over. [man on radio] Go again, over. There is an emergency here, please. Over. [man on radio] You have nothing to worry about. Over. I need an ETA. I have over 100 kids here, please. Over. [man on radio] No need to worry about us. We're fine. Over. Try me. Jess had sex with Adam. Shut up. A week of hand jobs got a little boring for her. So she seduced him. [groaning] His penis was bigger than yours. Just a little. Nothing worth being upset about. But she had intercourse with him. And he performed above average. What are you saying? We've got an emergency. We need help. [man on radio] We apologize for the fear you're experiencing. It will all be over soon. Over. You're lying. Are we lying? Or were you looking for Jess Wednesday night, only you couldn't find her because she was by the lake with Adam. All right, I'm fine. See, I'm fine. [chuckles] Stupid mindgames. Stupid. We're happy you're OK with it. Because after, Jess couldn't stop thinking about it. And masturbating about it. Well, it's perfectly understandable. He's a good-looking guy. [chuckles] It's understandable. Perfectly... Un...der...standable! Why would he? What? Why would he fucking do that? [chuckles] Good monkey. Just keep it running. I'll get the kids. Adam! Be careful. To the power of I derivative over N to the power of I. [man] Does anybody know what this is? No one? This is part of Price's model of the evolution of altruism, recited verbatim by an unconscious 8-year-old girl. Why was the dying thought of this girl an equation only known by scholars of Price himself? This moment forever changed my perspective of science in the mind. I call it the Kayla Phenomenon. The experience of channeling a memory or information that is not your own. And there are countless examples of this Kayla Phenomenon. There's this 6-year-old girl from Kentucky, who's never had a flying lesson, but she lands a small aircraft while her father is having a stroke. Or that this patient can explain every detail of his brother's wedding despite being 2,000 miles away in a coma. This is not science-fiction. This is real. I'm looking for a small grant to continue my research isolating the cause of this phenomenon. Imagine how shared experiences can shape our future. Or pooling our brain resources for complex applications. Forget about the equation. We could literally have a situation where any one of us can feel what the rest of us are feeling at any given moment. It is truly the ultimate social network. [indistinct chatter] That is impressive. I'm sorry. I don't recognize you from the... Doctor, we have something I think you're going to want to see.

Tell me where she is. You shouldn't be so worried. After all, she's not alone. Clark? Is she with Clark? We're watching them together. She's running across the field. Crying. Her legs are shaking. She won't make it much longer. Tell me where they are. She's stumbling. Oops. There she goes. Poor thing. We're crawling on top of her. She's scared. Aah! It will all be over soon. Make it stop. Make it stop! We're connected with her. It's done. That simple. Fuck you. What did you do to her? We've improved her. She'll be with us soon. It's much better this way. You'll see. [groaning] She's whispering something. What? What is she saying, Jess? Adam, run! Jess, speak to me, please! What? Fuck! [bat clatters on floor] [crying] [Clark] Adam. Adam. Shut up. [Clark] Adam, let us in. [Clark] Adam. We know a sign is telling you not to let us in. Ignore that. We have to talk. Yeah, I'm good, thanks. [Clark] Relax, Adam. If we wanted you dead, we would set the building on fire. Go away, Clark. [Clark] There really isn't anything you can do. One way or another, we're getting in there. You open the door. Do it the easy way. We'll say what we have to say and then leave. You have our word. If you try anything, you're dead. That's enough. [Clark] Poor Adam. Still this lost boy, hiding in a log. Where is she? Is that what this is about? Did you lose your girlfriend? Do you feel in control? I feel like you don't tell me where Katie is, I'm gonna see the inside of your skull across this fucking floor. You hate us for taking Katie, don't you? It was easy. You abandoned her at that van. No, I didn't. -You didn't? -No, I didn't. When we found her, she was all alone. She was afraid. Shut up. Shut up! You could have protected her. You left her instead. She was scared. You could've protected her. You could've protected her, but you let her fend for herself. You let her go. She was begging, please don't turn me. I was the one to hold her down. [groaning] How does it feel, Adam? How does it feel to lose somebody that you love? We have found that intense anger is the best cure for your pocket. [groaning] Aah! Uhh. [Adam] Clark. The truth is, I don't hate you. I love you like a brother. You do? Yeah. But I have a message for you to deliver to all your little friends. There's something I want them to see. [thud] I will find her. [Clark] Do it. Embrace your anger. I'm not angry. [bat clatters on floor] Oh, shit. Where am I? Oh, oh, shit! Oh, what the fuck? Wait, Jess! Jess! Jess, Jess, stop it. Fucking stop, Jess. Look at me! It's Adam. Please just tell me where Katie is. I don't know. I don't know. [thumping, door rattling] [Katie exhales] How do I look? You look beautiful. [coughing] -Adam, you should leave. -No. You need to get out of here. You can save us. You can still have a life. No. I'm not leaving you, Katie. You know, I was wrong about you. No, you weren't. Oh, if this had been last week, I would be halfway down the mountain right now getting pie waiting for the government to napalm this place. That's nice. Yeah? You know, there's an argument to be made that you're one of the worse things that's ever happened to me. Ha! [coughs] [sniffling] Well, I'm sorry I ruined your life. It's OK. It's OK. I wasn't doing shit with it, anyway. [coughs] It's OK. It's OK. Adam, I'm scared. I know. I know. I know. [coughing] Adam-- Adam, I'm dead. [sobs] [chalk scraping] [chalk scraping] Phew. You came back. You were here. Remember. Remember. Uh, OK. Not my memories, not my memories. Come on focus, focus. A weird Russian experiment in 1984 comes around to 2014. Then--then we've got this thing called a pocket, which I have no idea what that is. Damn it. [exhales] Ah! Has to all be connected, right? OK. This is your base of operation. Of course, you'll have as many assistants as you see fit, handpicked, of course. Your lab, your personnel. If there's any piece of equipment that you need that isn't here, you let me know, and I'll get it to you as fast as I can. Just remember, we're government. We work at the speed of government. The notes from previous experiments are-- Oh, good. [Yuri speaking Russian] I don't speak Russian. Ah. Here are the translations. "Initial trials are encouraging. Subjects are telepathically linked, allowing them to share thoughts and memories. They've become a single entity-- a bee hive working in unison, their individual desires forgotten. In rare cases, subjects have been able to disconnect themselves from the Hive for small increments of time. I have dubbed these glitches pockets. During this time, their individualism is restored, but they suffer from disorientation and memory loss." Who am I? [Baker] "In most cases, subjects enter a pocket after being confronted with an external stimulus to which they've ascribed emotional attachment." This stuff is 20 years old at least. Where's it come from? A discontinued Soviet programm. Those commies were into some crazy shit, but, uh, you'll pick up where they left off. What's that stuff on their skin? Uh, side effects of the virus. We're hoping you may be able to eliminate that, but it's not a top priority. [tape stops] My theory about the interconnected nature of our minds. My job is to create solutions to future catastrophes. You understand? When do I begin? Ah! Holy shit. I can tap into the memories of anyone. [sniffles, exhales] Ah! Goddamn it. I can see it all. I can see everything. The more of our minds we share, the more alike we become, the formula for the perfect life-- 16 hours a day awake, 30 minutes a day of working out, 137 minutes with a loved one, seven minutes being sexually active, just one muted mass working towards the same goal-- perfection. Ah! I'm still one of them, OK? I'm disconnected, but I'm still one of them. I remember. I've been coming to this camp since I was a kid. I crave constant attention from women to fight the loneliness. I fucked over my best friend. I'm the douchebag who busted Katie's head open and couldn't protect her. 288 friends on Facebook, 115 friends on Instagram, the memories of seven billion people stuck in my fucking head. Ah! I have to focus. I can remember anything if I focus. Holy shit. It's like... I can remember anything. It's like Google. If I just focus on something... All right. Enough of that. Katie. What's going on? What's wrong with her? Hold on. [sobs] You snapped out of it, right? So whatever you did, she can do, too. Uh, I don't know. I don't know what you're talking about. Jess, what happened? Please just tell me. Uh, um... What? Jess, talk to me. I don't know! I--I felt something. I was freaking out, and then I just-- Think. I--I-- I saw--I saw-- I saw faces. I saw your-- yours and her face, and then I-- I don't know-- I woke up in this chair, and I'm tied up in this chair. It's all I know. Wait. So if you remember something from your life or something emotional, you can--can come back from it? Uh... I need your help, OK, Jess? We're gonna get out of this shit hole, - I swear to God. - OK. [Yuri speaking Russian] [woman] Dr. Baker, you have another applicant in your office. I'm waiting on-- Fine. I'll go in there now. I don't know how you expect me to get any work done around here. What's happening? We're waiting. Hi. I'm Dr. Baker, and you are... My name is Yuri. Oh, uh, I'm sorry. I thought-- -I thought your name was-- -It's Yuri. OK. Well are you familiar with the position? I'm not here for the position. I don't understand, but we're very busy. Uh, my name is Yuri. Yeah. I got that. Yegorov. Dr. Yegorov? Once Katie turns, we're gonna-- we're gonna remind her of something to bring her back just like you were brought back. That's not gonna work. Why not? It's too late! Uh! I have so many questions for you. I've read all your notes. The virus is shockingly resistant to change. I've been-- Dr. Baker, I know where you're going. Aah! Aah! The subjects will become hostile and determined to spread. Their intelligence and brain power by far exceeds our own. It's impossible to control them. This is evil. With all due respect, doctor, we disagree. Don't write it off as evil just because you failed to control it. Uh! Uh! Uh! I've been poring over your work for months. I thought you were a genius. Dr. Baker, do you know what word "kaniez" means? I don't know that word. It means the end. Ah! Uh! Ah! Adam... Aagh! Uh! Aagh... Fuck. Uh! Oh, shit. [coughs] [Adam] Katie. Katie, stay with me. [Katie coughing] Katie, I'm gonna figure this out, OK, and then--and then I'll come back from you. Katie, stay alive and hang on. [Katie] Adam, wait. Where is she? I will find her. Oh, Katie. [hisses] We were expecting you. Look, Katie. Look at me, OK? You can come out of this. Just remember who you are. Remember what's important to you. We know what you're trying to do. We don't want to change. We're perfect now. Your pocket will end soon, and you will be back with us. It's better this way, Adam. Can't you see? You will never have to be alone again. No. No. We know how this conversation ends, and while you're doing the wrong thing, it's-- it's important to us that you don't feel sad. How does this conversation end? With you bashing Katie's head in with your bat. If you are smarter than me, then where is everyone? Why haven't you burned this place to the ground? I mean, you saw what I did with Clark. Why haven't you sent in your little drones to come help save you? You are of no threat to us. This body is of little importance. It's important to me. We know. You know when I first told you about my feelings for you before any of this shit happened, it wasn't really it. We know. You're not as smart as you think you are. You were wrong about the bat. Nngh... Uh... [Katie] Look, Adam. OK. I'm gonna make a rule. You can't say those words to anyone until you actually mean them, OK, like, really mean them, like, feel it in your gut, can't keep it in or it might just burst out of you kind of feeling. Until then just-- Until then just don't, OK? Nngh... I love you, Katie. OK. [exhales] Apparently, it was a jolt of electiricty that restarted my heart, and then I woke up in the hospital. [machine gun fire] - Come on! - Oh... Can't fucking die! Oh, shit. Up, up, up. [gunfire continues] OK. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. What the fuck happened? Uh! OK. Here we go. This better work. One, two... three. [zap] Katie, wake up. Katie? [zap] Wake up, Katie, please! [zap] [Katie gasping] Holy shit. Katie? Oh, my God, it worked. Here, sit up. Sit up. Come on. Just-- Just breathe. Just breathe. It's OK. It's OK. [panting] Ah! Katie, focus on breathing. Trust--trust me. Trust me, Katie, please. Who the fuck is Katie, and who the fuck are you? You swore. That's good. Oh... [Katie] Adam, wait. [pounding on door] [hammering continues] You came out of it. You had no memories at all. You had no idea who you were or where you were, so I'm gonna give myself a little note, a reminder. [coughs] [gasps] Ah! [coughing] Please never ask me to do that again. I think I shit myself. Can you please tell me what the hell is going on now? It will all start to make more sense when your memory starts to come back to you. Oh, shit, for now, we have to get the fuck out of this infirmary. OK. There's a van in the parking lot. It's our best bet. If we take the forest path, there's a chance we'll get there unnoticed. But I don't even remember-- Katie, Katie-- Katie, you're gonna have to trust me, OK? Everything's gonna be OK. There's some masks and gloves behind the nurses' desk, OK? We'll get those before we leave. OK. Let's go. [creaking] [coughing] Oh, remember. Remember. Oh, it's up to me. - Nobody moves. - Do what he says. Back up. Back up. Give me the samples. All of them! Don't do this. Dr. Baker, unless you want to die today, I suggest you do everything I say. Put them in. - Is this everything you have? - Yes. Yes. - Is this everything you have? - Yes! Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here. This is not good. Stop him! Yaagh! Katie, just get the van! Yuri, wait. You don't understand. Oh! Start the plane! For the love of God, start the plane! Rrgh! [engine starts] Start the plane! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. OK. You win. [panting] Uh... I give in. [pipe clatters] Uh! [tires screech] [coughing] Just remember Katie. Get in. [coughs] Remember. Remember Katie. Please just remember Katie. Remember Katie. Ah! Uh! Maybe I lied to her... but soon, she'll remember everything. She'll know. She'll remember the speed and aggressiveness in which the Hive spread everywhere. She'll remember the last holdouts of humanity falling. She'll remember the five days that she spent locked up in the infirmary starving to death waiting for me to find my pocket so I could save us. She will realize that there's nowhere for us to go, that I lied to her. Everything is not going to be OK, but for now, she still has hope. Heh. Katie, you know, she once told me that love is a false reality, and now I'm building her one.
