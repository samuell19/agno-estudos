Richard John Wincott. Case number Delta 6920. It's Richie. Where'd you go last night? Just out. I just saw some friends. Lauren? No. Just some other friends. You're eighteen now. You said no to staying with us here at the children's home. You know what that means? You need to seek a job as soon as you can. Come on Jakob. Catch the ball! Let's talk school. Why not get the GED? I don't want to go to school. I want to be on my own... start working, and I think the GED's just going to slow things down. Where you want to go? Would you rather go to the library or to a party? Uh, probably a party. Parties are more fun, huh? Yeah. And do you like to read? Um. I don't know. Sometimes. I don't remember much of it, but I do remember we were staying in a hotel room. And there was a woman in a car who had taken me and my brother, and I remember us leaving. And it was dark outside. I don't know how late it was. I remember crying, and my mom just kept saying, "It's okay. It's only for a little while." And that was the last time I lived with them. Fifteen years of not speaking to your adopted dad, and the first word that you say is "Hey." And he says, "What's up son? How you been?" And that's when CPS came to the apartment that we were staying in. And that day... that same day, my mom had a miscarriage. I, uh, I washed my clothes in the creek. Um, it was right beside a railroad track. Um, cooked my own food out there. I was sitting right behind her, too. She was leaning out the car. And I thought she was actually... I was actually about to see my mom go all over the highway. She was on a lot of drugs, and that she drank regularly. And I remember them drinking all the time; they always had a drink in their hands. I didn't know about the drugs until I was older and someone else told me. And I didn't... it makes more sense now. But I don't think there was really a lot of reasons for the stuff that happened. God is good. All the time. - All the time. - God is good. I'm glad y'all say that with me. Now look. Everybody in this room has a goal, a success story. I grew up through CPS. Eleven years. Throughout that time I've been through foster home to foster home, group home to group home. What I want to tell you all today is, and I'm going to make it all real short and sweet and simple. And I'm going to beat it out like Tarzan. What I'm doing though is I'm trying to inspire y'all to become the greatest that y'all can be. To not become a statistic. The question is, who are you? What do you want for yourself? Accomplish that. Fight it. That's the best thing I know how to do is fight. I plan. I plot. I know how aging out goes. I talked to Javon about it. He's doing fine now. You know what we call it? - Call what? - Aging out. What? Emancipating. College is not for everybody, but education is. Education is a lot like American Express. You don't want to even think about leaving home without it. Education is a lot like Tide. It gets out the stains that all the others leave behind. And we can go ahead and say what fear really is. It's "False Expectations Appearing Real." You know my story. As your instructor, I told you. What's really, really important, as you go out in this world, at the age of eighteen, are the last four letters in American. "I can." And the arresting officer this morning that was intimidating the man under arrest because voices... I called about leasing. Um, last name's Wincott. I need a first month's rent and a security deposit. Oh. Uh, you're twenty-five short. It's four-fifty. It's four-seventy-five with background check. I don't... I'll have to come back. Hey! I'll add it to next month. How much does that make next month? All right. They pick up the trash on Wednesday. Use the green bin close to the back door. And you're going to have to jiggle the mailbox key, but it'll work. So. You need any help moving in? Oh no. I got it. All right. Here you go. Thanks. Jessica. Hey, it's Richie. Yeah. Richie. Yeah, from the old house. Yeah, I know. It's been a while. How are you? Are you busy? Oh, yeah. I... Great. I had no idea. So, when did you get engaged? We've done some great things. We've had some really great games. Especially, Sam Houston State. I thought we played really well. You've got a license? Yeah. Any arrests? Nope. Nothing serious. No. Well, we'll find out. How's your physical? Clean. We need fitters, lifters, painters. - All of it. - Yeah. I can do it all. How much construction experience you got? Not much. Watch out for these operators. Look for their blind spot. They can't see you when you walk up behind them. I need to get a bunch of the road stilts set before the weekend. Hernandez. Wincott. Ten dollars was taken out for lost PPE. You want to make it up, you work nights. - Bellagio. - Nights? We're short a body. Botts. I'll do it. Be back at six. You'll get a new work order. Door was one-twenty-seven. I thought we agreed on ninety-five. It's the cheapest I could find. Stay safe. I'm Swim. Richie. All right, Richie. What was the damage to the land lady adventure? What's that mean? Uh. How'd you make out? Did she gouge you? Did she rent you a place with a corpse in the closet? She was okay. Well, that's good to hear. She'd sell her own daughter if she could. And for twice as what she's worth. You got ripped off? She rips off everybody. People ain't got much brains here. You understand? There's nowhere else to go. You see? And she knows that. But one wrong could be wiped out next to a hundred wrongs. Justice. Ninety-three dollars. He bends down to catch the ball but he can't stop himself. So, he passes the ball over here, and then he throws it. Much better than that. Yeah. Just like that. Just like that. What's that? At least I throw better than you. I never claimed to play ball that way. You know? - You got a light? - I do. There you go. - You like them? - I do. - You do? - Do they come off? - Maybe. - Maybe? Hey, the water is off in 6A. Oh no, I paid. I paid that. Huh? Who else can I talk to? Payday Advance. Yeah. I'd like to get a loan. How much? Uh, three hundred. Date of birth? 11/11/98. And your driver's license number? Yeah. It's 3-5-3-6-2-4-7-1. Who's your bank? I don't have one. Okay, you'll need to open a checking or savings account and have it open at least a month before we can help you... - I can't wait a month. - You can do it online or in person. You'll just need two forms of ID. Where else can I go? You could try a pawn shop. Thanks. What is your full name? Richard John Wincott. Address? 6A Ellington. You employed? Uh, yes. Uh, no. I was. What was the name of the company? Hiddleston Utilities. You ever, uh, you ever late with your rent? Oh, no. I'm not late. When was the last time you seen Ms. LaField, your landlord? It was about a door I fixed. - That was about a reimbursement? - Yes, sir. What was your relationship like with your landlord? - Relationship? - Yeah. You get along? Yeah. You know of anybody maybe didn't get along? Had debts that might have led to anger towards her? No. Ms. LaField was killed and her office was robbed. You need anything? Four games played and all at Baylor ballpark. A woman found dead has now been ruled a homicide. It was sad because you think who would really want to hurt such a wonderful person. Neighbors tell us she was much more than a landlady. She was like family. If you was late with your rent, she didn't pester you. Or bothered you. You could have been late up to probably two months, and she still would have cut you a break. Then she'll say to you, "Okay. Are you hungry? Do you want some dinner?" She was a very nice person. Very compassionate. How much for a train to Shreveport? No Shreveport. We can do New Orleans. How much? The train leaves at 6:30. The coach seat is fifty-eight dollars. You have uh, three hours, sir. You need some help? It's not mine. Can't drive stick. You want me to try? It's okay. I should call someone. Uh. I don't mind driving you somewhere if you've got somewhere to be. You can wait inside. I'll call you an Uber. Where you going? No. That's okay. I was headed to this side of town anyway. No, you weren't. What's your name? Richie. Joan. You from here? Killeen. Army brat? No. Big family affair left all this with me. - I'm okay. - It'll go bad. I'll make you a plate. You like it this quiet out here? Not always. It's nice. You live all alone? For now. You married? No. I was. It's cold. Even if you're not working at this moment, you're on. Okay? Our job is to make the guests feel welcome. Even if it's not something you need to do, you find somebody for them. Okay? And then you want to make sure... I'll be right there- if they offer you a tip, respectfully decline it at first. But if they insist, you can accept it. You've earned it, okay? But only if they insist. Look, when they do it it's really important that the lapels be pressed above the button-hole and above the buttons. - How you been? - What are you doing here? You don't write. You don't call. What's a gal to do? You follow me in here? I saw you outside. In your nice new uniform. Very sharp. You know... you know? We work together. Uh. Yeah. Swim? Think about everything that goes on. Everything that we can't see. The women in this hotel that you wouldn't believe. Not like her. You know, bigger. My May. My Mona. Your May what? Come on, can't you just give me a little kiss? Uh. Fine. This is Richie. - Hi, Richie. - Hi. Now, Mona is here at the hotel very often so you will probably be running into her a lot. So, I wanted you guys to meet each other. Stop telling all my business. Was this today? - Yes? This was today? This was today. - This was like an hour ago. How many people you seen today? - She's got to think about it. - What time is it like seven? Eight? Richie's an orphan. He don't have any folks. I'm sorry to hear that. I didn't have a dad so... We don't have to talk about it. You're so shy. Well that's what I get out of a liar, isn't it? Come on, baby. Now that was my first one! How'd you like that one? So, our old lady, huh? What about her? She's dead. Just like we said. Don't say that. No? On the bus, that one night, we didn't talk about it? No. Yeah, we did! We talked about it. I just said that we didn't like her. That's all. No. No. No. I... Richie, I got a good memory, buddy. Working together. And we drink to that. Hey. You see this? This is the south side. Don't get hit by that car. - Whoa! - Nothing but fields and churches, Richie. Okay. You're swerving! ♪ At the end of the world ♪ ♪ There's no one waiting ♪ ♪ For you ♪ ♪ In the beginning ♪ Stop! I'm alone! ♪ There was right ♪ ♪ But now ♪ ♪ It's done ♪ ♪ Feel different now ♪ They don't look like friends. You want to fly around a little bit? Yeah, just go up two blocks. Right, here's good. We don't see things clearly, yet. We're squinting in a fog. Peering through a mist. We hope unswervingly and we love extravagantly. Let no one be cruel. Let no one be proud. Let us not revenge. Let us not be conquered by anger. Now is the day of joy. Of goodwill. Of peace. You're following me. You've got that stick shift down, huh? I'm better. I practiced all morning. These going in or out? Out. Oh. I'm so stupid. I think my keys were in there. I set my purse down. I wasn't thinking. What do you do? Do you call triple A? I can get it out. Could I? Where'd you learn that? Foster dad. Do you mind if I take a few? What's this? Tortilla toss. Yeah? - You first. - So, you've got to throw it... oh look, they got one on. It's like, uh, horseshoes. Yeah. Okay? Ready? Oh! Really. Feels old fashioned to go on a walk. My Nana used to say, "Never make a big decision without going on a walk." You've got a big decision to make? Maybe. You play things kind of close to the chest, don't you? - What does that mean? - It means you're secretive. I'm not secretive. So, why'd you want to go on a walk? I like you. This was always a summer spot for me in high school. Hmm? This was always a summer spot for me when I was in high school. Where did you go? Waco High. You? McLennan. That's for rough kids. Did you go to Baylor? No. I lost interest. My dad got sick, and I just forgot about school. He was a teacher. He would have hated that. Can't you still go? Things keep changing. You'd be a good teacher. I have a New Year's Party on Friday night at my work. I have to go. Do you want to come with me? Yeah, I do. - Hi. - Hey. I thought I'd get a jacket. I see that. That's a really nice dress. I'm trying for the new year. It was one of my dad's. Did your dad make you do this? No. - You look amazing! - So, do you! I guess we're late. No, no! We just started. Okay. It's so good to see you. We should catch up soon. Yeah. Sure thing. We'll go get a drink. Okay. You remember Melinda? - Of course. Happy New Year. - Happy New Year, sweetie. This is my friend, Richie. - How you doing? - Richie. You've got a good one here. We all love her. Yes, sir. Where'd you find it? Um, my mother bought it for me. - Oh. Nice. Well, it's nice to see you. - Nice to see you. So how long you two been together? Not long. Good. Good for you, man. She's uh, she's great. She's uh... I've known her a long time. So, how did you two meet? Who are you? I'm Jamie. Richie. Yeah. All right. - I love that on you. It looks great. - Thanks. Are your earrings new? I got them like a year... like our last anniversary. They're maybe like a year old. Did you see her? A divorce. A death. And she still finds time to date? You are so mean. He's cute, right? He just seems a little young for her. Right? What do you want her to do? Stay at home all day wearing black? It's her choice. Hey. You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Happy New Year! I want you to stay over, but I don't want to sleep together tonight. I haven't told you. Um... I can't sleep. I have to take these pills to close my eyes. I see things at night. I lost my mom. Last month. Now, I don't want to be alone. I'll stay. Uh, good night. Good night. - Hello. - How y'all doing? - Good. How are you? - All right. Mind if I talk to Miss uh Melanie in private for a few moments? - Of course. She's right over there. - Appreciate it. The person we're closing in on, your mother believed to be harmless enough to allow access to the leasing office after hours for whatever reason. Now there is a good chance that the profile of the person is a desperate individual who wanted money for drugs or pay off debt. But, it's also possible that it's someone your mom took a shine to. So, you think on it, and you let me know if you ever remember her mentioning somebody new in her life these past few weeks. Somebody she would have had no reason not to trust. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Some guy's asking for you downstairs. You were moved three times in five months between foster homes when you were thirteen. How come? Cause. Me and one of those foster moms didn't really get along. You fight her? I've been reading up on you. You know how to handle yourself, huh? I bet you also know how to run away, too. Right? Things get too hot. Ain't that right, Richie? You know what that's called? Hm? It's called "Fight or Flight." It's evolutionary. Comes out of us when we sense a threat. All those juices inside of us, that adrenaline, tells our brain, our muscles, everything what to do. Most people don't have to live like that, but you have your whole life. Haven't you? Ain't that right? Yeah. I guess so. Now, what would you do if I told you that your fingerprints were all over that office? We've also found a witness that said he saw you leave the site at eight o'clock. Now, that's a whole hour and a half later than you told me. - I didn't do anything. - Let me tell you what happened. It was all about the money. You needed a little bit of cash to cover some loose ends... pay some bills. Hey, I get it. Look, we've all been there. You ain't no killer. I know that. But you got scared, and that's why the land lady's dead. It was just about the money, and it went wrong. And there was a second safe in that office. Stuffed full, but you didn't know that. You didn't see it. And there was another drawer with three hundred and fifty in petty cash, but you only wanted a little bit to get by. You weren't greedy. What do you think the outcome of all of this will be for the person who did it? Hey. Need a ride? No. I'm good. I don't mind. Hold up. Come on. Where you got to be, huh? Go away. Here. Come on. This way. I got to go to work. You're not joking around, huh? Is this the serious, serious you? Come on. I need your help right now. Please help me. Please. I can't. All it would take is just one little word, Richie, for me to knock things down. You've got cops at your work. At your house. What do you want? I want you to get in the van. We'll get a coffee first. I don't like you. You're going down, come on. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Harder. Harder. Harder. Harder. Come on. Harder. Harder. I know everything about you. You're a lot like me. I was in and out of juvie. I had a teacher that really liked to rag on. She never stopped. I snapped and hit her until she was black and blue all over. It was ten minutes before they could pull me off her. I was that mad. Everybody always tries to tie you down. Tell you what to do. I've got nothing to confess, you understand? No money. No real money. No jobs. No folks. But we're all right, right? I do what I can. It's all I've got. I don't hurt people. You mean on purpose? We're born alone, we live alone and we die alone. That's it. It's nothing. And that's freedom, Richie. People talk about having it all the time, right? What if it's a really little room? Really dark with little cobwebs up in the corner. We're going to a place that I've been working on. We'll be in and out really quick. Just stick close to me, and we'll fly through, okay? I paid the maid two-hundred for a master key over at the Motor Inn. Other than taking this wheel and killing us both, you don't have a choice. I own you. Come on. You want something to eat? Come on. Sorry. Get over there. Hurry! Sorry! Housekeeping. Yeah. Hey! You took everything from me! You don't remember? Give me back my things! I shouldn't drive. I quit my job this morning. I don't know why. I just needed to sleep. That's all. You know I was dreaming? I hate being alone. I'm going away for a while. Where? West. Why? I need to get straight. I can't be here anymore. Hm. You'll take me with you. Hey. Hey. I know you. I know you. Yeah. Okay? It's me. I'm bleeding. You're bleeding? Me too. I want to see the stars tonight. I didn't tell you the truth. My mother was killed. Murdered. Last month. I didn't know how to say it, so I didn't. It was at her work. At night. They robbed her. I should have told you. I'm sorry. My only friend. I've hurt you. Aimed at a subway. He ended up in the hospital. - We need to figure out if he was in fact... - Excuse me. Where you going, son? I killed her. I tried to stop her from screaming, and then, I robbed the office. Do you have any voices in your head that other people don't seem to hear? No. Do you currently believe that someone can control your mind? No. Prior to arrest, did you feel down, depressed or have little interest or pleasure in doing things? No. Do you have any nightmares, flashbacks, or repeated thoughts or feelings related to PTSD or something terrible from your past? Yes. Now look right here. Put your right shoulder on the wall and face straight to the left. Same thing facing the other direction. All righty. Now turn and put your back flat on the board one more time for me. I came back to this house I was staying at. The folks were okay. There were two suitcases on the front porch. Mine. I was eleven. That was it. No heads up. I guess they had enough. I was in a new home that night. I've never told that to anybody before. I'm at U of H. It's nice where I live now. I have visions of what happened. They haunt me. What made you do all that? First, I thought you were a monster, and that you deserve no compassion. I find myself at the post office with letters for you, and I think to myself, "What are you doing? Why should I write you?" You're nothing to me. I pray for you. I curse your name, but I pray for you. I know that you have no one in the world. I don't hate you. But I hate what you did to me. I want peace. For both of us.
