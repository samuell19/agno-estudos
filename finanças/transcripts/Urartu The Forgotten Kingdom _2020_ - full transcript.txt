It is said in the Bible, Noah's Ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat… While this divine salvation, Noah and his descendants turned a new page in the history of mankind. For thousands of years this place of refuge, called the land of Ararat by the ancient Hebrew people, remained closed to exploration. Centuries later, people realized that there was indeed a powerful country with a rich culture in the north of Mesopotamia, in the times of ancient Egypt and Babylon – a country called Urartu by the Assyrians. Urartu was ruled by great kings, who rose and fell while the country lived on. Numerous cuneiform writings tell us about the construction of fortresses and temples, cultivation of vineyards and gardens, and about highly efficient irrigation canals that have no analogues in world history. The Assyrian king Sargon II was stunned by the objects of art, discovered in Urartu. The Urartians waged wars with the powerful Assyrian empire, conquering new lands and expanding their territory. In the first millennium BC, Urartu was among the greatest empires of the ancient world. URARTU The Forgotten Kingdom The Kingdom of Urartu was consigned to oblivion for over 2,500 years. The land it used to occupy is now surrounded by mystery... According to the Old Testament, Paradise on Earth, the scene of Adam and Eve's origin sits somewhere in the Armenian Highland. The Bible also says that the Armenian Highland was the place that granted salvation to Noah and his family during the Flood. Since ancient times, this land was mostly populated by the so-called proto-Armenian tribes, who founded an array of states. The largest of which - Mitanni - was formed in the 17th century BC It had existed for about four centuries, before suffering a fatal blow from Assyria. The fall of Mitanni led to a political split in the entire Armenian Highland. By that time, Assyria had already conquered the whole of Mesopotamia, and turned its eyes to the north, towards the land that was cradling the heart of its future arch-rival, a kingdom set to be remembered in history as Urartu. The first known mention of Urartu comes from the Assyrian cuneiform writings of the 13th century BC. They indicate that a large tribal union in the Armenian Highland was already in a fierce military confrontation with Assyria. The Assyrians were stronger by far, and winning. Their simple goals were those of plunder: the seizure of valuables, and cattle raiding. In the 19th century, when in assyriology, people translated the inscription and discovered the name Urartu for the first time, it was very exciting, because they realized that it was the same name as “Ararat” in the Bible. So it's a very important moment. The generally accepted scientific opinion is that the words Urartu and Ararat refer to the same country. In the Bible, Ararat is Urartu. When it says “the mountains of Ararat”, it means exactly the Kingdom of Urartu. In fact, you could have encountered the Kingdom of Urartu frequently while reading the Holy book, and not even realize it. As with all historical names, “Ararat” has a sacred meaning. In the Jewish view of the world, “Ararat” means “the repeal of the curse” in regard to Noah's Flood. “Urartu” was the name the Assyrians and the Babylonians used to identify their neighbour. The kings of Urartu left chronicles that don't contain the name “Urartu”. They called their country “Biainili”, or “Van”, which is why the academician Piotrovsky later called Urartu the Kingdom of Van. More concrete studies of Urartu would not begin before the early 19th century. They were motivated by the translation of the book by Movses Khorenatsi, an Armenian historian from the 5th century. In his “History of Armenia”, Khorenatsi mentions that the famous Assyrian queen Semiramis took part in the construction of a city on the shores of Lake Van. It was the Ottoman Empire, in the region of the mysterious Lake Van where the French Royal Asiatic Society sent young scholar Friedrich Schulz in 1827. Schulz made the first description of the so-called “Wall of Van”, a long-time object of scientific interest. He found out that it was the main element of the royal residence of Urartu – the city of Tushpa, modern Van. The research team discovered vast rooms in the rock, presumed to be the royal burial spots. Friedrich Schulz sketched the cuneiform inscriptions he found on the walls of the fortress city, which he sent back to the Royal Asiatic Society. The cuneiform writings were not yet deciphered in that time, so Schulz had no idea what they said and which kingdom they described. Schulz was tasked with studying the city of Van. He spent a couple of years there and busied himself with discovering various artifacts and trying to figure out which culture produced them. Unfortunately, he was killed by Kurdish bandits in 1829. The studies were halted after the murder of Schulz. However, the road to studying Urartu was finally open after British orientalist Archibald Sayce deciphered the cuneiform inscriptions in 1882. What they revealed was essentially an absolute sensation for science, as the Kingdom of Urartu was not known to exist in Armenian Highland before that. The main sources of our knowledge of Urartu are the cuneiform chronicles from Urartu itself, and neighbouring Assyria. For the most part, these are royal chronicles depicting campaigns and conquests. The first known king of Urartu is Arame, who ruled for about 15 years starting from 859 BC. It was in King Arame's time that Urartu became a state: he united scattered tribes, founded the capital city, Arzashkun, and formed an army to resist the permanent Assyrian threat. Shalmaneser III ascended the throne in Assyria at that time. He conducted a campaign against Arame in the very first year of his rule, heading to the lands adjacent to Lake Urmia. The merciless conqueror thus described those events: “I approached the fortified city of Arame of Urartu, laid a siege to it and seized it, killed many warriors, built a tower from their heads in front of the city, and burned 14 surrounding settlements.” In the third year of his rule, Shalmaneser III invades Urartu again, and this time the capital itself, Arzashkun, becomes the key battleground. "While I was in Arzashkun, Arame of Urartu placed his hopes on the might of his army," indeed raised his entire army, and marched to meet me. I defeated him, killed 3,000 of his warriors and filled a vast steppe with their blood. I seized and destroyed, and burned Arzashkun, the royal city of Arame of Urartu... The dynasty of Arame was no longer dominant in the territory of historical Armenia after the campaigns of Shalmaneser III. A new dynasty emerged, and a new core of statehood came with it - Van, or Biainili. Sarduri I became king in approximately 843 BC. He founded the new capital of Urartu, the walled town of Tushpa. The main task of this ruler was to confront Assyria. He turned the whole country into a unified front and started preparing for a new war. The cuneiform writings about Sarduri I indicate that he succeeded in cutting short the Assyrian campaign in the west of the Armenian Highlands. In other words, king Sarduri essentially stopped the Assyrian army at the borders of the Armenian Highland, stripping it from the ability to strike a powerful, lethal blow to the Kingdom of Van. So, we can say that the rule of Sarduri I was the beginning of an era of prosperity for the Kingdom of Urartu. Tushpa eventually became the economic and political centre of the country. You can still see the fortification wall in the western bottom part of the Van Fortress. It is built from large stones, some 6 meters long and 1 meter high. The wall bears inscriptions in Assyrian, which tell about the construction of the fortress. In fact, they are the first written documents we have from the Kingdom of Urartu. Having reached certain military, political and economic progress, Sarduri I started calling himself “the king of kings” and “the king of the universe”, as did the Assyrian leaders. During the rule of Sarduri I, a new royal dynasty originated in Urartu. The kings of Urartu were living and working in very troubled times, and you can see it from the city plans. These towns were essentially fortresses. The fortresses of Urartu could not be taken without siege weapons. The Assyrian army had no way to carry them around during the harsh winters of the Armenian Highland, so Assyria was forced to reserve military campaigns solely for summertime. Urartu was considered Assyria's main rival. That antagonistic relationship is similar to what the Soviet Union and the United States had during the Cold War. All political processes in the Middle East were related to and went through the rivalry between Urartu and Assyria. By the end of the 9th century BC, the Assyrian influence on the region faded for a long time. The era of a different power was dawning – the era of Urartu. The new kingdom squared its shoulders properly by around 810 BC, during the rule of king Menua. Menua was the grandson of Sarduri I. He ruled alongside his father Ishpuini since the young age, and learned a lot from successful military campaigns in which he was involved. Menua's father, king Ishpuini implemented a religious reform in Urartu, recognizing Haldi as the supreme god. In the eyes of the Urartians, Haldi, who is also worshipped in Assyria, could take on Assur himself – the supreme god of the Assyrians. As the God of Sun, Haldi was also the god of everything. People prayed to Haldi for luck, happiness, success. Pilgrimage is also associated with Haldi, so there is no coincidence that most temples were dedicated to him. Once the faith in Haldi consolidated in the minds of the Urartians, Menua organized several successful campaigns to the northern borders, and expanded the territory of the kingdom. Assyria was gathering significant forces at this time. The Assyrians conquered Manna, and that country became the apple of discord, and a permanent battleground between Assyria and Urartu for many years. Menua was able to take a stand against Assyria. He took back Manna and other lost lands, and even reached the Assyrian borders. Striving to raise the combat readiness and power of his army, Menua covered Urartu with fortresses. The fortresses were built to thwart enemy attacks in the central regions as well as in the lands from Malatia to the southern shores of Lake Urmia. Town building was a priority in the period of prosperity, because it directly concerned national security. On the slopes of Mount Ararat, in the South Caucasus, rose Menuakhinili - the city of Menua. One of the wonder structures of that period is the 70 kilometres long channel that supplied water to the capital and adjacent villages. Surprisingly, it still stands, and serves its original purpose. It is a huge construction. Some walls above the gorges reached 15 meters in height, so that the aqueduct could deliver water to Van. From the technical viewpoint, that construction had no analogue in the ancient world. It must be noted that the engineers of Biainili had one major task: secure one meter of pipeline pitch per kilometre. They had to cut through rocks, round the gorges, and go above them in all cases. Construction of the channel drastically increased the agricultural potential of central Urartu. Later on, Menua used similar channels to actively develop farming in order to feed his huge army. Apart from the cuneiform writings from the period of Menua's rule, the only other documents to mention this channel are the works of the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi. He ascribes construction of the channel to the famous queen Semiramis, who ruled in Assyria in the same period as Menua in Urartu. Undoubtedly, she surpassed him by fame. Literally everyone knows about her famous Hanging Gardens of Babylon. As time went by, people started calling Menua's channel “the channel from the times of Semiramis”, and later simply “the channel of Semiramis”. Menua was reformer-king. Menua strengthened both the army and economy over the course of his rule. As years went by, he expanded his kingdom, kept the score with rival Assyria balanced in his favour and consolidated the power of Urartu in Western Asia. Menua made Urartu a powerful kingdom, an empire even. Menua ascended to the throne when his country was relatively weak, and he left it a strong kingdom with an army capable of fighting any enemy on equal terms. After Menua died in 786 BC, he was succeeded by his son Argishti I, who would proceed to become the greatest commander in the history of Urartu. The kingdom found itself in a dangerous situation into the very first weeks of his rule: Assyria moved its armies against Urartu. Simultaneously with these worrying news from the south, Argishti I was troubled by reports from the north. Northern tribes and states formed a rather strong coalition over a short period of time, and started raiding Urartian settlements. A major war was underway. Argishti was well-aware that Urartu could not fight on two fronts for very long. Most likely, that is why the king decided to crush his enemies in the north first, as the northern coalition was weaker than Assyria. His troops covered the northern lands like a swarm. That campaign destroyed the northern coalition for good. The strategic task was fulfilled, and peace reigned at the northern borders of Urartu. Military actions carried on in the south. Argishti I threw Assyrians away from the borders, invaded the country as far as the mountains of Assyria, and defeated the rival army. After these events the Assyrians described Argishti, the king of Urartu, as “frightening as a heavy storm”. It was during the rule of Argishti I that the Urartian army switched from bronze to iron weapons. Most likely, it was the first army in the world to make that transition. Later, Assyria reformed its army by the Urartian example. Argishti continued his father's policies, actively building new settlements and fortresses. He constructed the walled town of Erebuni in 782 BC as a stronghold in Ararat Valley. The fortress standing on a high mountain was of strategic significance: it secured the valley within view for many kilometres. The guards would notice any movement of groups of people or armed units at once. On October 25, 1950 Armenian scientist Konstantin Hovhannisyan was in the middle of a research on Urartu. He discovered two basalt stones covered with cuneiform writings, which read: “By the greatness of the God Haldi, Argishti, son of Menua, built this mighty stronghold, and proclaimed it Erebuni, for the glory of Biainili, and to instill fear among the king's enemies”. Over time, Erebuni would grow into the modern capital of Armenia, Yerevan, and the discovery of Konstantin Hovhannisyan finally revealed the date of its foundation – 782 BC. Yerevan turned out to be 29 years older than the Eternal City, Rome. In 2018, Yerevan celebrated its 2,800th anniversary. For instance, in Armenia, most important is Argishti I, who extended the Kingdom of Urartu in Ararat plain, so it's very important. Argishti I was firmly settled in Ararat Valley. The channels he built secured irrigation for fertile lands, and his efforts in agriculture were crowned by rich harvests. Argishti could sit back for a while and enjoy the fruit of his labour. The king no longer had to invest so much of his energy and work to develop farming. Argishti was a business person. The economy of Urartu thrived during his rule. He had to feed a huge army, and he dealt with it very well. However, the period of peaceful creation, and labour did not last long: Assyria breached the borders of Urartu once again, and launched another military campaign. The power of Urartu was a mortal threat to Assyria, so its rulers had to invade the Kingdom of Van, and crush it at any cost. At the time when Urartu was at its height, Argishti I threw his forces to meet the enemy in a counterattack. He expanded the borders of the kingdom to the upstream of Euphrates, outflanked the Assyrian army, and cut its connection with crucial resources. King Argishti was certain he would prevail in the war against Assyria. He began implementing an ambitious plan he had on his mind. Meeting next to no resistance on his way, Argishti marched on the lands under the Assyrian rule, and conquered several cities. He went as far as the land of Babilu, which certain experts consider to be Babylon. We can see that Urartu closed in on Assyria in Argishti's term. The Urartian military command was able to organize a combined attack on Assyria from the north, and from the southeast. Argishti put Assyria on the brink of military catastrophe. The Assyrians had to assess their situation with all seriousness. They gathered what forces they had left, and counterattacked the Urartian army to drive it out of their territory. Assyria won back the lands Argishti had seized, and avoided the impending disaster. It appears that the two neighbours soon signed an agreement defining their borders. Argishti I retained the rest of the areas conquered by him and his father. The outcome was that Argishti made Urartu the most powerful state of Western Asia. His son Sarduri II inherited a strong, prosperous kingdom with a large and formidable army. The next Assyrian king was Tiglath Pileser III. He reorganized and reinforced the Assyrian army, returned the lands his predecessor had lost to Argishti and invaded Urartu. Tiglath Pileser III of Assyria marched on the Kingdom of Van, and laid siege to its capital Tushpa, although he failed to seize the unassailable citadel. The Assyrian army and king had to return home, but their campaign created a complicated political situation in Urartu. In these trying times, Rusa I ascended to the throne in 735 BC. Several regions of Urartu tried at once to use the transition of power to gain independence. Rusa I acted decisively. He repressed the revolts in key regions of Urartu, preserved the integrity of the state, restored order, and set about to strengthen the borders. He would tell about these events: “It is with my two horses and charioteer, with my own two hands that I conquered the Kingdom of Urartu.” In addition to this arduous task, Rusa I had to build anew the relations with the religious centre of Urartu, Musasir. The religious centre of Urartu was located beyond the boundaries of the kingdom, in the area bordering Assyria. It was a frontier between several countries who were using the rivalry of Assyria and Urartu to maintain their independence. Musasir was different, as it was home to the main temple of the supreme deity of Urartu. Many Urartians undertook pilgrimage, and covered a long, dangerous road to the hardly accessible mountainous region in order to reach the main temple of the god Haldi in Musasir. Farmers and soldiers alike linked their achievements to the power of their supreme god. It should be noted that people were more religious in ancient times. The main difference between now and then is that religion was not separate from the state, art or science. It was all one complete whole. Rusa I restored the relations with Musasir and, having secured the support of Haldi, resumed the development of Urartu, consolidating its military and economic power. Everything changed when Assyria welcomed a new king in 722 BC Resolute and hawkish, Sargon II was the younger son of Tiglath Pileser III. He dethroned his elder brother Shalmaneser V. And was quick to demonstrate an aggressive attitude towards Assyria's northern neighbour. Sargon II was an experienced military leader with typical views of an Assyrian king. Upon seizing power, he defined a clear goal: prevent the strengthening of Urartu, and defeat the arch-rival of his country. Sargon II waged wars in the west in the first years of his rule, against Syria and Palestine. Afterwards, he turned towards the north. Sargon always prepared for campaigns meticulously. It was especially true when it came to his worst enemy, Urartu. His spies provided intelligence reports that have been preserved until nowadays. Sargon II was only waiting for a good moment to attack. Assyrian scouts and spies of all sorts gathered everything Sargon needed to know about Urartu, and the kingdom's economic and political state. Both Sargon II and Rusa I did not dare to go for a direct confrontation. Their rivalry unfolded in Manna, the buffer zone. For several times in this period, Sargon conquered Manna and enthroned a puppet king… Rusa responded by organizing rebellions in favour of the candidate loyal to Urartu. The situation took a dramatic turn in 715 BC, when Sargon II heard the report about Rusa's failed campaign against Cimmerians. Written artefacts indicate that Rusa I lost a significant portion of his army in the battles against Cimmerians, which was beneficial to the Assyrian king. Sargon II considered it to be a good moment to act and moved his troops against Urartu. He started with punitive expeditions against Rusa's allies, and drove the Urartians out of the region near Lake Urmia. The first country he attacked was Manna, and it could not ward off the Assyrian assault. Sargon punished the rebellious kings viciously: he skinned them alive and put their corpses on display for the people of Manna. Sargon II was essentially annihilating the elites of the society in multiple regions west of Euphrates. It was genocide. Rusa I gathered his forces, and hurried to the rescue. Sargon II did not halt his march, and was still destroying Urartian settlements, when a sudden report came in that Rusa I stopped to camp with a large army in a gorge east of Lake Urmia with the intention to take the Assyrian forces from behind. Sargon changed his plans at once, and marched towards Rusa. The unsuspecting Urartian soldiers were resting, peaceful, when Sargon's troops broke into the camp in an unexpected attack. Rusa's warriors fought back desperately, trying to save their king to their last ounce of strength. But the battle ended in a bitter defeat on their side. It was a hard blow for Rusa I. He had to leave his soldiers to their fate, and flee to keep his own life. For Sargon, it was a chance to move further north. He destroyed the large Urartian city of Ulkhu, sweeping everything in front of him, and burning even the sown fields. Soon Sargon reached the region where Rusa's brothers and other relatives lived. This is how Sargon II described what happened: “In passing I marched on Arba, the residence of the house of Rusa. The seven adjacent settlements, the dwellings of his brothers and family, where the guard was strong, these towns I destroyed and laid to waste, burying his sanctuary.” These blows were even harder for Rusa I to take. In a culmination of this destructive campaign, Sargon approached the boundaries of Tushpa, dreaming of the seizure of the capital of Urartu. However, upon thinking over his possibilities, and the intelligence reports, he turned his army around, and moved back to Assyria. He was merciless, laying waste to Urartian towns and settlements on the way. With a part of his army, Sargon II undertook a difficult march through the wooded, mountainous area, and attacked Musasir, a sacred place for any Urartian. The town itself and the temple of the supreme god Haldi were destroyed in the most barbaric manner. By the standards of those times, it was sacrilege, but Sargon's hatred for Urartu was so great that he dared to take that step, and even felt so proud of what he had done that he ordered a detailed story of the pillage of Musasir to be carved on the wall in one of his palaces. The Assyrians took out huge amounts of gold, silver, other precious metals and stones from Musasir, as well as figurines of Urartian kings and gods, a golden statuette of supreme god Haldi before everything else. Sargon II wrote in his chronicles: “I brought misery upon the whole of Urartu and its land, and I made the people who live there wail and cry.” His chronicles also tell that when “Rusa I heard that Musasir is destroyed, and his god Haldi is seized, he took his own life with his own hands, his own iron dagger.” The next king of Urartu was the son of Rusa I, Argishti II. He inherited the throne in 714 BC, facing the worst possible consequences of the recent war with Assyria. The Urartians lost 430 large settlements in 7 regions of their kingdom. The treasury was empty. The country – devastated. The state power in Urartu was shaken for the first time. Argishti II longed for vengeance for his father and country, and did not fear a new war. The retribution for the grief Sargon II caused Urartu caught up with him a few years later. Cuneiform sources describe construction works that Argishti conducted from the central part of Urartu, and in the regions Sargon II burned through during his campaign. This difficult state of affairs along with new threats from neighbouring countries, forced Assyria to take an unexpected diplomatic step. Assyria and Urartu agreed to change the nature of their relationship. Weary of new severe conflicts, the perpetual enemies began resolving disputes through negotiation more often. There is an assumption that Argishti II negotiated a buy-back of the “chief” bronze statue of god Haldi, seized in Musasir, and returned it to Urartu. Argishti II thus spoke of himself: “I am the servant of god Haldi, the loyal shepherd of the people.” Gradually, Argishti II returned the regions that broke off from the Urartian kingdom in the south, north and east. He managed to knit back together the Kingdom of Van for the most part. Quite possibly, Argishti II reached the regions closely touching the Caspian Sea, and moved in that direction further than any other Urartian king. Argishti II essentially restored the state and passed it to his heir reinforced. It is known that Argishti's son Rusa II also carried out intense town building to consolidate the power of Urartu. Some Urartian inscriptions tell about the large-scale construction Rusa II organized to create a new administrative centre in Ararat Valley. It was called Teishebani, “the city of god of war Teisheba”, built to replace the deteriorating old centre, Argishtikhinili. The ruins of Teishebani still stand on Karmir Blur, in Yerevan. In the first half of the 20th century, renowned Orientalist scholar Boris Piotrovsky launched a full-scale excavation in the area, the results of which shook the entire scientific world. When we started digging, and got out that many discoveries, monuments to the daily life, and the festive life of the Urartians, the Urartian art, it became instantly clear that it was uniquely Urartian style and spirit. Due to this excavation and these studies, the science was pushed towards recognizing Urartu as something tangible, and comprehensible. So to say, this is an example of serious science, which makes things comprehensible and tangible, and creates an image of the culture. The history of human activity in the Armenian Highland amounts to tens of thousands of years, which, undoubtedly, affected the culture of Urartu. Archeological findings draw an exhaustive picture of top-level handicraft trades in Urartu: bronze, iron, gold and silver working, wood and wool processing, leather working, as well as the manufacture of decorations, and war needs from these materials. Religion ran through all areas of life in Urartu. The discoveries of religious items include bronze figurines of Urartian gods. There is a statuette of god Teisheba discovered by my mother. It is a figure holding an axe, and it can be identified easily as Teisheba, god of war. The Teishebani fortress – Karmir Blur – was named after him. So, my mother discovered that figurine of the god of war on June 21, 1941. On the following day, Germany attacked the Soviet Union. Additionally, the excavation in Karmir Blur unearthed unique storages for preservation of agricultural products: the karases, some several meters long. A "karas" is a large earthen jug for food and drinks. People could keep oil, beer, wine and other products in karases for a long time without risking spoilage, all due to a secret: the larger part of karas was buried in the ground, which kept it cold. You could call it a prototype of the modern refrigerator. Urartian artefacts have been discovered in various parts of Armenia. For instance, the multicolour frescos on palace and temple walls were carefully recreated in Erebuni fortress, which is within city limits of Yerevan. These frescoes depict gods, sacred animals, and ceremonial and hunting scenes, all decorated with vegetative and geometric ornaments. The cultural heritage of Urartu did not simply pass down to the next Armenian states. It possibly influenced others, Persia and Greece for example. Urartu outlived Assyria, which began to lose its territories in the second half of the 7th century BC in a fierce confrontation with the separated Babylonia and the rising Media. In 612 BC, the Assyrian capital of Nineveh fell after a long siege laid by the Babylonians, Medes, Scythians and Armenians. The Assyrian state ceased to exist in 605 BC. Despite more than a century of research about the mysterious kingdom of Urartu, we still do not know enough about the beginning, and the end of its history. It's relatively unknown now, we have a lot of problems to understand exactly what happened. Especially, when it collapsed, and why. Argishti I to Rusa II – quite clear. After is unclear. There's change... The least is not very clear. Which one was the last one? Which one was not the king? In which sense, it's very difficult to understand that. But especially I think that in Armenia one of the keys to understand what happened at the end of Kingdom of Urartu – we have one of the keys here in Armenia. It is believed that Urartu ceased to exist in early 6th century BC, but there is no solid data to support the theory that Urartu met its end exactly in that period of time. This most important issue is still pending. Obviously, the kingdom of Urartu did not fall in a strict sense. Most likely, what happened was a change of dynasty in about 648 BC. It is an indisputable fact that the Kingdom of Ayrarat, or Armenia, existed after Urartu in the same area of the Armenian Highland. It was ruled by the Yervanduni dynasty, and governed from the same capital city – Van. This was the end of the cradle of civilization called Urartu, which shone in the mountain heights of Armenia for three centuries, from the 9th to the 6th century BC. Urartu was the first state in the history to unite numerous tribes of the vast Armenian Highland into a common kingdom, thus growing into one of the largest civilizations of this grand and mysterious ancient world.
