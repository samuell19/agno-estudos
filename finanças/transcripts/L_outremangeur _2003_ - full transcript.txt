BASED ON THE COMIC STRIP BY TONINO BENACQUISTA AND JACQUES FERRANDEZ Don't move! Get over there! Get down on the ground now! On the ground! Get over there! JEWELER Are you doing what I asked? You think you're buying time, smart-ass? Don't move! Hello, boss. Hi. How long do SWAT need? Half an hour. That's too long. You can't go in there! What the hell is he doing? Stop right there! I'll shoot you, fatty! Let him go! Hurry up and get out! Beat it! Come on, come on! Stop! Don't leave! - Don't leave! - Hurry up! Go on... Shoot. Shoot. - Good evening. - Good evening, Inspector. The usual? - Get me a stretcher. - Right away. - Warn team two. - Sure thing. The blood's been coagulated for four hours. - Hello. - Hi, Séléna. At first glance... At first glance, he's dead. You'll tell me the rest later. Don't touch him. - It's fine, I'm used to it. - Right. Mr. Deputy Commissioner... Victor Lachaume, the biggest shipping magnate. - His office is downstairs. - Yes, I know. That's his wife. The young woman is his niece, Elsa. She found the body. Why did she find the body? She'd often have coffee with him in the morning. I know her. She called me directly. I took her statement, she's in shock. Can't we let her go home? Do you... 'know' her? No. - Sir, where are you going? - Let me through, I work here. What happened? How are you? Fine. Want me to take you home? Okay, let's go. Marc, I... We should stop seeing each other. But we never really... 'saw' each other. Because of your uncle's death? - Once it's over-- - Marc... - I don't want this. - Don't want what? This game between us, it's stupid. "Yes, no, maybe, I don't know..." And you're still waiting... The truth is I love you very much... - Very much. - But you don't want this. After what's happened, I don't know. I don't know anymore. And... there's my dad. Fine, you're being loud and clear. We'll end it there. Inspector. You're a cop, so can I be honest with you? How long? Six months... A year. A year, maximum. Look at how fat he is! Did he quit smoking? Ow! - I'm going to die. - I didn't know, sir, sorry. Sir, you're hurting me! That guy's nuts! All you need is eyes. You're very talented. It's not finished. Ow! What's gotten into you? This is my address. Be there at 9:00 p.m. You'll come because you're scared. Scared you'll go to jail for your uncle's murder, scared your dad will find out you slept with his brother. See you tonight. Come in. Give me your coat. As you wish. Please sit down. Would you like a drink? Sit down! Don't move. Eat. No one's ever had to endure watching this. Absolutely no one. For 25 years, I've been eating alone. Always alone. You probably don't care, but... this is harder for me than it is for you. Tonight, you feel like a prisoner. But with time, you'll get used to it. You'll be free to go in five minutes. I'll expect you at the same time every day from now on. I'm the only one who knows you killed Victor Lachaume. I won't ask you anything. Not a single question. And one year from today, you'll be free. I'll walk you back. Marie! CONFECTIONER Thank you, goodbye. Here you go. Hey! - Hello, ma'am. - Hello, Captain. TO MY HUSBAND Go on, ask me your questions. - This may not be the place for that. - I hate decorum and false pretenses. It's why you came, so go ahead. Alright. Then, I'll be direct with you, Mrs. Lachaume. Did your husband have a mistress? Honestly, I don't think he did. Where were you the night of the crime? You already know. You've questioned Émile, my brother-in-law. He asked to come see him... after the bar closed. He did say that, yes. He's having money problems. Why didn't he ask your husband, then? It's just like a novel: two men started out very close, two brothers, and then, poof! I have another question: do you intend to entrust the business to Benoit Collet? That would be like making Al Capone head of the FBI! Do you really mean that? Here. This will clear things up. - Relax, I just have a few questions. - Is this about Mr. Lachaume's death? You were an intern at Fret Océan over a year ago and now you're Executive Secretary? That was quick. - They gave me an opportunity. - Who? Cops are dumb, really. They hate unanswered questions, it makes them think. Do you recognize this letter? You typed it out. I'm guessing you were in a hurry to warn Mr. Collet. You think like me, don't you? You just thought that... he might have had some answers about Mr. Lachaume that night? You're late. This can't happen again! You must be punctual! You see... this is my only meal of the day. You didn't cry this time. What do you want from me? I'm just like you, Elsa... learning as we go. Sit down, please, the meal isn't over yet. You're bluffing! You have no proof. You made love an hour before his death. That didn't kill him. And you're here now. You're wrong to think that's a confession. I don't mean any harm, Elsa. I only ask you to be here every night from 9:00 to 11:00 p.m. You need me... and I need you. What if I tell them you're blackmailing me, hiding evidence? You won't. Either way... I've got nothing left to lose. When do you plan on screwing me? I don't think there's a need to be vulgar. It's not vulgar. Some great people do it, you know? So, you just want me to watch you eat? Why not just have a hooker do it? They're used to this, they must see freakier cases than you. You insult yourself by saying that. Just remember one thing, Séléna: I'm just a mirror. I'll look at you... but I won't see you. See you tomorrow, Elsa. Be on time. Gabrielle? Well, every time I've started a diet, I've never stuck to it. My mother says I won't make it, I've got no willpower. She thinks it's just about willpower. She doesn't eat a thing. She thinks she'll catch something. She even peels her grapes! She says the skin has lots of nasty bacteria. I sit at my drawing desk, fully concentrated. And every time I have to bend over to pick up a ruler, my stomach gets in my way. I see it in front of me, flapping around. It makes me want to grab a cutter and cut out all that fat. But instead, I rush to the kitchen and I eat and eat. It's funny, it's as if... the more you see my stomach outside, the emptier it gets on the inside. It's endless, it really is. - Would anyone like to respond? - Endlessly eating, yet never craving. Do you mean you have no desire for it? No desire for anything? I don't know... I really don't. You want to eat because you want nothing else? Is that how you feel? That emptiness you mention, what do you think it is? You're avoiding me? Are you angry with me? No. Why do you say that? I don't know. You're angry because I didn't cry about Victor's death? - I have nothing left to cry about. - It's fine. - Are you sure? - Stop it, Dad. I'd love to know what's going on in your head. You know you can tell me anything. We've always been there for each other. You and I are the same. Now! So, you've chosen your day. This dish is my specialty. It's very good. Thank you. So... why today? Because today is the last day. I won't be here tomorrow. What? Let me go! No, our pact was for a year! What pact? You decided that on your own, you're insane! I don't care if I go to jail, you hear me? I don't care! Arrest me if you want, but leave me alone. You disgust me. Wait! I don't want you in jail, Elsa. All I want is for you to sit in front of me two hours a day. Is that so hard? Am I really that repulsive? Go on, tell me. Look at me. Look at me, God damn it! You're fat! You're hideous! You want others to see you? Being seen isn't a right, Séléna, you have to earn it! Why did you choose me? Why? Maybe it's because of that scar you have on your beautiful face. Everything must have meaning... something like fate. You're crazy. Do your job! You're paid to stop murderers not to judge people's souls! Or to deal with your issues. See you tomorrow. Gentlemen, where are you going? Mr. Collet? - Come with us. - What's going on? - Just come quietly. - I don't understand! You're under arrest for organized trafficking and counterfeiting. For now. We'll talk about Victor Lachaume's murder later. The murder? What did you tell them? The truth. That Victor had signed your letter of dismissal. He found out about your shitty deals, and he was generous enough to just to kick you out. That cost him his life. I won't let this happen! I didn't kill him! Tell them! That I was with you! My husband really did trust everyone, didn't he? Goodbye, Mrs. Lachaume. She's not here. How are you? She's been abandoning her father lately. - Could I have some coffee? - Sure. Blanche? Two coffees, please. So, it was that asshole who killed my brother? He might have. Did you know him well? Barely. Here. I never dared to ask you: how did that happen? An accident. My wife fell asleep at the wheel and never woke up. But I did... as a disabled widow. My three-year old daughter was asleep in the back, didn't see a thing. Yes, I was as young as you are now. And in ten seconds, I became an old asshole. Life's a bitch, isn't it? Ask me questions, if you like. About what? - About me. - I couldn't care less. You've already told me plenty. You want to believe in fate? Well, so do I. I can't fight it, so I give in. For a murder, just two hours of prison a day... that's not so bad. You won't say what you really think. So what? Don't look at me like that. Just focus on your own plate, that's your real problem. Like you said, you're a mirror... so I'm looking at you. By the way... Yes? You've never been with a woman? Not in that sense, no. In that case, repeat after me: "Elsa, I won't fall in love with you." Elsa, I won't fall in love with you. Again. "Elsa, I won't fall in love with you." Elsa, I won't fall in love with you. "Elsa, I won't love you." Elsa, I won't love you. Very good. I won't love you either, Séléna. Richard! Richard! Richard! You killed Lachaume. All the evidence points against you! It was me... Because you decided it was me! You have no proof! I'm a low-life crook, sure. Lachaume let me do what I wanted. I used his company to treat myself. I know, it's not pretty. But I didn't kill Lachaume! I'd never do that! Sit down! What are you doing here? Is this a bad time? Uh... yes. Fine, come in. We miss you at work, it's been so long. Wow! I see you're treating yourself. Are you having guests over? No. I'm preparing my meals for the week. It's for my diet, for my heart. Well, it's working, you're... Well, you've... Benoit Collet is still denying it. He says it's a set-up, but it doesn't make any sense. I think he'll give in soon. It's nice to have faith. Sorry to tell you this, but your investigation's a bit lacking. What about the girl he'd been sleeping with? What about it? We didn't know of any mistress. I can't get a DNA test from every girl in town. You're right. When I come back, we'll talk about your transfer. What's the matter? Every time I've asked, you shut me down. I had a good cop working for me, I couldn't let him go. My life's on a tight schedule now, so... I'll walk you to the door. - See you, Brisset. - Bye, Boss. Shit. It's a pleasure to look at you. Eating is so natural to you, just natural. Eating and making love, all that is normal to you. It's a part of life. I don't know. - When I was young-- - You were young too? Yes, sometimes... - This "sometimes" childhood was-- - I don't want to talk about it. - I do. - I don't. You're right. Please forgive me. When I was young, I'd eat a lot. My dad would say, "You're doing it justice." I'd talk a lot too. I'd watch him. I'd try to find out what he was thinking about. Whether he was thinking about the accident or something else. When I started drawing, I'd only draw portraits of him. - Did he like them? - I don't know. Maybe. I don't think he ever thought about that. I don't think he really saw them. I like your paintings. - I find them magnificent. - Thank you. Victor was the only one who'd tell me that. A girl my age sleeping with her uncle, does that shock you? It doesn't? It shocks me. Come in. - Are you busy? - No. I got my letter, thank you. - No need to thank me. - Oh. Fine, I won't thank you. And I won't tell you that, although you're insufferable, I've enjoyed working with you for three years. Sentimental, aren't you? Yeah... So are you, right? Who knows? Something's different about you. Right, your hair! Go on, scram. Are you okay? Elsa, I... Well... Here goes. I'm being transferred to Paris. And I wanted to... Come with me. Marc, please, don't... You know I can't. Okay, forget it. Although, I can still change my mind. I can stay here if I want. If I want... I can stay. You should go, Marc. Go to Paris. You've been waiting for this. You waited, now it's happening. That's good. Yeah. Yes, I waited, now it's happening. That's good. Go easy on me. It's beautiful. I don't mean the model. You mean it? You really like it? What happens when we look through? What really happens? Do you know? What we look at... looks back at us. Do you like to dance? - I don't want-- - Come on, just one! Goodbye. Goodbye. Boss! Boss! Boss! Hello, Inspector. - Your Honor, I need to speak with you. - Go ahead. - It's about the Lachaume case. - Lachaume? It's case closed, Collet's serving time. Starting tomorrow. - I know. - Boss, you're up. - Now? - Yes, the judge has called for you. We've overlooked evidence. We missed something in the case. The body has a second wound. But... that wasn't in your case file. But it is on the body! Okay, I'll delay the case a few more days, but the prosecutor's getting impatient. Inspector? I don't get you at all. You're gone in three days. Why are you still meddling? Lachaume was naked when he died, the murderer dressed him. How do you know? If you get your balls caught in your zipper, what do you do? Just bear it and zip up? I can't imagine Victor Lachaume meeting Collet butt-naked. And his brother would get the business. His brother? His car's too small. So what? He could have sent someone. "Someone?" Like who? What's the secret, dammit? Stop making fun of me! It's nothing. Just a misunderstanding. This whole dumb thing's about sex. About sex, yes. You and your brother-in-law? No. The other points of the square. A long time ago, my husband had an affair with Myriam, Émile's wife. When he ended it, Myriam became depressed. She told her husband about it, and a few months later, crashed her car into a tree. Are you alright? I'm fine. Maybe there's a more recent affair. Your husband had a mistress. You've told me already. That's not very tactful-- I don't care about being tactful! Who was he sleeping with? - I know you know! - I don't! I don't know! Mrs. Lachaume, who was he sleeping with? What difference does it...? We know that Benoit Collet is innocent. Yet you pointed us to him. But she killed him. Isn't that right? - No, she-- - Who was your husband's mistress? I went to his apartment one day. I'd never dared before. And I saw... her... leaving his apartment. But who? Who was it? - She's so young. - Who are you talking about? Elsa. Mrs. Lachaume... you killed your husband? That deafening silence between us... I just tolerated it. I thought-- I don't know, I just thought... he loved me... from afar, like I did, despite everything. That like me, he was waiting for it to return. But Elsa? He had no right! So, I went upstairs. When he opened the door, he was naked. He was the man I'd always loved... I loved him like mad. Do you understand? - Boss, don't you think-- - Sorry, I have to go. You're late. Come inside. What's the matter? Why did you do it? - Why did you lie to me? - What? Let me go! - You were meant to be guilty! - What are you talking about? Your aunt just confessed. That can't be, I killed him. She's just been arrested. I'll go confess. Brisset will never believe you. You have proof. Give them to me, Séléna. Tell me everything, I need to know. That night, we made love... but I wasn't really in the mood. Right after, he said he had to talk to me. He told me about him and my mother. - And you didn't know? - No. He hugged me tight and said he felt better having told me. I wanted to leave, but he grabbed me. I screamed, he said he loved me. I didn't know anymore... I didn't want to... I don't know why I killed him. What's the point of confessing to them now? She can withdraw her statement. She won't do it. She's convinced she has to pay for something. She thinks she caused my mother's death, my father's disability, and everything Victor put her through. Give me the evidence, please. Please, Séléna. Climb on. Get on! - I'm listening. - I have nothing to tell you! Stop! You're insane! How long? - What? - You and him, how long? I was too normal, is that it? It was me... I killed Victor. Séléna had proof. Here. He blackmailed you? It's more complicated than that. I asked you if he blackmailed you! Yes! Stop, you're hurting me. What did you give him, then? Did he screw you, is that it? Yes, he screwed me! Are you happy now? He screwed me! Arrest me, it's for the best. Do it. Do it, Marc. Don't try to understand. Brisset, I need to talk to you. I've nothing to say to you. Listen to me, you're making a mistake, it wasn't her. It wasn't her? You're the one saying that, Séléna? Usually, you find out everything first. She's covering for someone, it wasn't her! She slept with her uncle. She confessed to it all. - Mrs. Lachaume confessed too. - The judge'll sort it. He'll get my report tomorrow morning, with your name in it too. This isn't about me, damn it! It's about Elsa! You're in love with her, throwing her in jail is your way of keeping her to yourself. She killed her uncle. The law's putting her in jail, not me. The law doesn't think, it has to be followed, and you're just abusing it. I didn't touch her. I swear I never did. That's not the issue. Yes, it is the issue! Her life is in your hands! You're scared, Séléna. You played with fire. Now, it's too late. It's turned to ash. Are you guys crazy? - Stop! - Alright, enough! That's enough, calm down. It's okay, we're done here. Back to work. - Lachaume! - We're closed! Open up! What do you want? Elsa's been arrested! Open this damn iron curtain! To do that, you have to let me go. What are you doing? Where are you taking me? Who killed him? - Stop! - Who was it? Stop it, I'm slipping! - I don't care! - I'm slipping! Who killed him? Stop! I said I'm slipping! Who was it? MAGISTRATES AND LAWYERS Victor was an adopted child. My parents tried to compensate for that, they gave him everything. They loved him, and so did I. Well... we weren't the same, but we loved each other. When it came down to it, he took over the business. I bought the bar. I had no head for business. We'd give him everything, and he'd take it all. Even Myriam, even my wife. He killed her, you see? He killed her! So, when I saw that Elsa... my little girl... It was too much. Too much. This is what I used to kill him. Then, I panicked, I didn't know what to do. So, you called your sister-in-law? She was the only one who could help me. She came over and we dressed him. Mrs. Lachaume, please. Your Honor... I'm so sorry. Elsa! Elsa! Leave me alone! Go away, I hate you! I hate you! THE JUNKYARD BOSS KILLED THE BRIDE YOU'LL FIND... Gabrielle! Gabrielle! Dad! Dad! Richard! Can you hear me? Richard, it's me! Don't do this now, you hear me? Richard! Look at me! I'm here! Look at me! Yes... Yes, Richard! Look at me! Look at me, Richard! Come.
