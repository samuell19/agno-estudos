Directed by Akira Kato What? Was it you? Are you slacking off? Mrs. Fukagawa has been banned. Anyway, please just keep these. Banned again? Right. If is used for an assumption. Neither something if. It signifies a double negation. In other words, If you want it, I am not Romeo or Montague. - Got it? - Yes. Then continue. I can't. People might come. Please read aloud. If you do, nobody will notice. Simple phrase, isn't it? Why don't you read it? I don't understand it. You don't? Then how about this? It's in the original text. You still don't understand? No, I don't. What a classy lady you are. I haven't done anything like this before. It's embarrassing. Mister... Just don't abuse your body. No other choice. This is all because you had too much fun in your life. I've already suffered enough of the consequences. This is the result. It's been two-and-a-half years since it started. I don't see any improvement. As you advised, I don't drink or hang outwith girls. I am like a Buddha now. That's the issue. It's physically not possible for you. How dare you do those things to your body? Anyway, don't abuse it. Shizu! Okay. I'll take a copy then. Tsuruta is still young, but his writing is quite deep. I just want Tsuruta to do what I want to do. I'll add some drama though. - Mister! - Yes? Call a rickshaw. The doctor is leaving. Yes. Your sweat is sweet. It tastes very sweet. It was so tight when we did it for the first time. Now look... It's gaping like this! Ryounkaku, Asakusa Mr. Tsuruta, this is not an ordinary pub. Why don't you enjoy yourself more? Unlike me, he is a popular guy. He doesn't buy cheap ones. I was just trying to be hospitable. My girls are kind and they like men. But you don't like men, do you? Okay. the men-hater is leaving. Good, good. Excuse me. Are you alone? Hey, what are you going to do with Tsuneko? I will take responsibility. Responsibility? What responsibility? What kind of responsibility exists between a man and a woman? In my opinion, it's best if I wait until Tsuneko graduates. You don't understand what I mean. I'm not asking you to make her your wife. Then what? As you can see, she is unpredictable. Her parents died and I'm her only sibling. She is fragile and lonely. And you skillfully relieved her pain. Mr. Muraki! I think she believes your relationship is love. But it's not love. It's loneliness, sentiment. In other words, she's in love with the emotion itself. Right? That's what I mean. - I won! Banzai! - Not yet. - I definitely won. - Let me go. - Drink. - I had enough. - Just drink! - I am bringing the cup. I have a cup right here. Or are you saying you don't like to drink from a used cup? Ididn'! say that. Why do you get so mean when you're drunk? Just drink. And after that, let's go upstairs. I prefer the taste of you over beef. Especially this part. Mr. Muraki. Do you mean that I am nothing but an animal, like a pig? Stop insulting me! You sound upset tonight. What is going on? If you don't like it, please leave. We don't need customers like you. I am leaving. I don't want to disturb your business here. What an annoying guy. Hey, can I have a broken umbrella or something? There is no broken umbrella. Madam is waiting for you. Madam? Please. Madam will be with you soon. You are very wet. My name is Yonosuke Tsuruta. She asked me to come in. So I came in. You are not who I was expecting. Please forgive me. I am not? Oh... She is my aunt. She can't hear or see things clearly nowadays. Sorry for the trouble. No. It's no big deal. Since I am already in here, I'd like to stay until the rain stops. Okay. I am leaving without saying anything. Whether you leave or not, I feel like I'm getting tricked by a fox. But are you okay with it? Him knocking on the door sooner or later? He might be getting very wet. It's fine. It must be some kind of punishment. Punishment for who? For me. Can I stay here a little longer, until the rain stops? Please do. Do as you like. I would like to have a glass, given your kind offer. I think it's strange that only one woman lives in this big house. I feel lonely sometimes. Do you want me to guess? Your husband must be in Russia now for work. And he must be a medic, not a private. Well, maybe even higher. He must be a veteran in the Imperial Army. He is a veteran. He is like a ghost. So, please keep tonight's events a secret. You must be very afraid of him. You must think that I am a lascivious woman. yes I do. I can't. What? You can't do it. This is what my husband is like. He treats women as slaves without feeling any guilt. Okay, please do it. Please arouse me. I love you, miss. I've started loving you all of a sudden. Please turn off the light. You must have a master key, right? Give it to me. Please stop asking. I won't. - The key is... - Where? Where is it? It is in the lucky charm bag. Nothing is more comfortable than sleeping. You sleep so well, mister. Idiot! I am not sleeping! I am thinking about something. I am okay with you thinking. Please do it at home. Everybody wants the banned books. Go home! If you don't go home, I will be in trouble. Go write. Excuse me. Ah, mister! Did Mr. Muraki come here? Ah, yes. He did. Again? How tenacious. He is. And with that body... He is already in hell. What an idiot. - Can I have a beer? - Yes. Mister! Hell? What do you mean by that? I mean women in general. Women are hell? I see. Novelists' words tend to sound special. And you are popular too. He has a hole to hell in his body. I would consider you the God of Death taking him to hell. I used to be one. Not anymore? It's none of your business. Kuma! Don't argue with my customer. I got it, you fucking hag. He has been upset recently. No No! No! No! Don't! Hey! Don't! No You can't kiss me now, can you? Are you that afraid of my disease? Of course. I use my body to earn money. My wallet is over there. Take it. Don't! Oteru! Oteru! Someone is calling you, Oteru! I don't want to! How tenacious! - Oshina, go. - Yes. Oteru! Lung disease and cholera are not as widespread as you think. What's HP? Mr. Muraki is... - The wind will make it worse. - I see. I hope he gets better. He is sleeping well. I am leaving as well. Mr. Tsuruta! Please stay overnight. I feel vulnerable. It's okay now. But I... Mr. Tsuruta... My body is trembling for some reason. I can't. I am leaving now. Shizu! Shizu! Come. Here. Madam! Please forgive me! Madam! N9! Please forgive me! Madam! Good Morning! I stay at a separate house next to a shrine to take care o! my brother. As you know, we have an English village here. Dr. Lawrence examines me sometimes. Fortunately, my brother is getting better. I think you are writing about love affairs. Why don't you stay here for a while with your draft? My brother feels lonely too. From Tsuneko. You look fine. Thanks to the medicine from Europe. At least, I am alive. From now on, you will never hang out with those kinds of girls, alright? Those girls are not for you. Even if Oteru is a slut, no one can replace her for me. Unlike you, I can't change that easily. I have no one else but her. Is it weird? It must be. However, I am totally into her. Tsuneko! Tsuneko! Tsuneko! Tsuneko, kiss me! Tsuneko... It's been a while. I worried about you because I didn't see you around your brother. Sorry. This is Fuyo Tsuruta. He is my English teacher. Oh, an English teacher? My conversation skills are not very good though. Let's go, Lawrence. A pleasure. I tasted the joy of love for the first time. I felt like I was totally immersed in happiness as I walked in the street. Shimuralistened to me with asmile. 'But my mother doesn't allow it. ' 'Then let me go to your house by myself. ' If I pretend to go there to hang out with your brother, your mother won't suspect anything. Shimum stopped all o! a sudden. 'Ifyou sayso, how about... ' Excuse me. Mister! Here. Do you want to go to his place? Do you know where he is? Yes. It's a place called Gotsu, where the village mayor lives. It's itchy. - Mister! - Huh? If we defeat Russia, will Japan become even bigger? I don't know anything about that. Bullshit! People from Tokyo know everything! They do. I know ever ything! Oh! Akamatsu! Mister! I came hereto check if you are doing fine. I'm kind of busy right now. Please wait 2-3 minutes! Idiot! It's too late to hide it! Sorry! I am going to make it quick! Quick! Quick! Welcome back. - Please add this to the meal. - Kes. You are...? The owner told me to wait here. I see. I didn't expect you to find me here. I've been looking for you everywhere. In the end, your colleague told me that people call Yonosuke Tsuruta Mr. Fuyo. I want you to return the key. My husband is coming back from Russia. So. please... Ican't. Why? Why can't you? You stole the precious thing. You can't say that you can't return it now. I am scared all the time lately. When I don't lock up... I feel like my body is swirling. I will return it. I've been waiting for you since then. Show it to me. This is the very last time. Huff! Huff! What's funny? I just think the relationship between men and women is a mysterious thing. It is. What kind of guy is he? Who? The lascivious guy you were waiting for when I got into the house. I don't know. He must be a beautiful man, like an actor. Well... Did he make the key? Please stop! No! Please stop! no no No! Please stop! open it Please open it! Madam! Your body will not disappear even without the master key. Wrong. I am that kind of woman. You have been locked up your entire life. No, I have not. It's cold! Please return it. Ifl return it, you will leave, right? There's no other choice. Then I won't return it. When are you going to stop playing with me? Everything is for love. I would do all sorts of evil things for love. I won't ask you anymore. I don't care about it either. I am going back to Toyko. Madam! Let's leave everything behind. You wish. Promise me now. I would leave everything behind. Are you listening? Hey! We are being carried away by the flow. Damn! Did you take the key? You don't trust me that much, do you? We made a proper vow. It was a lie, wasn't it? We have been carried away this far because you got angry. Mister! Mister! Mister Tsuruta! He disappeared, leaving this letter. That woman again? What should I do, mister? His body won't last any longer. Let me try to find him in Tokyo. I won't go to Tokyo. Oteru! You are not supposed to work today. Why? You saw his face, didn't you? It's already quite dangerous. I don't really want to say this... but you might get sick because of his disease. I am telling you this for your own sake. Thank you. Kuma is worried too. You tend to become strangely excited when Mr. Muraki comes. What? When will you stop pretending to be worried about me? You only care about whether you can sleep with me. Sorry for the wait. It's ridiculously cold tonight. Is it? I am sweating though. stop You have a high fever. - It's normal. - Stop! Oteru! Yes. It's none of your business. Sorry. When will you become my wife? Will you make me your wife? Kuma made you do this, didn't he? Go take Muraki's money, right? Idiot! You have such a twisted personality! No. no. no... I am sorry. It's okay. Oteru. You can't! You will die! Iwant to do it! I want to do it tonight! Don't. No... Don't do this. What is it? This early? Did Mr. Muraki come here last night? Yes, we saw him. He threw up blood again. How disturbing. And? He said he would hang out with Oteru around Ueno. How selfish. Whatever he does, I don't want him to die here. Here. Did you find him? No. But I am relieved that he is with her. What is today's date? The 29th. It's tomorrow, right? yes Perhaps he came early and is already looking for you. He said it would be the end of the month. That's tomorrow. Soldiers tend to follow schedules strictly. I think I am going to bring my stuff from my house. I need my kimono and my savings. okay That's my plan. But your husband... Please come to my house at night. As you did before, give me a signal by knocking on the gate. If you do so, I can bring my stuff without being noticed. Okay? Please do it for me. Do you think it will be okay? It will... Mister. Can I drink some? Sure. I am a bit drunk tonight myself. He is back. Not now. The three of them have been in there for an hour talking about who gets Oteru. You can't join the conversation. Don't worry. He is with Oteru. Will you drink a glass? Mr. Kuma! Stop! Hey! Are you okay? What are you doing? She is attracted to you. - Do it for me. - What are you doing? I want to watch a married couple having sex. Hey! Given his health, he won't last long. Idiot! What are you talking about? Stop it! Idiot! You brute! Shit! Muraki! Just go die! Don't look! How is it? This is how a married couple fucks. Mr. Muraki... Oteru... You... I'm done! Don't you understand? She isn't mine! She only wants to do it with you. You made a mess. Shit! Kuma! You lost. Fucking hi9! She was almost crying. The willow tree's branches are moving gently. You are a good guy, mister. Look at the flow. The dawn breaks. 'Leaving is not easy. ' Is that what you said? The willow tree's branches are moving gently. The cute green color attracts people. Madam! Would you take care of her? Mr. Muraki! Mr. Muraki! Mr. Muraki! Mr. Muraki! Madam. Sorry for being late. You abandoned me, didn't you? I am sorry. Do you know how hard it was for me to wait here without knowing anything? Do you have any idea?! I am here now! Let's go! Well, now... Let's go! Darling... Darling... Welcome home. Forward! The End
